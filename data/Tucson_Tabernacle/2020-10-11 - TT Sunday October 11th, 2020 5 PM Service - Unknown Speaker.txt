hallelujah is that your prayer amen take me deeper amen take me higher lord amen you desire that tonight genesis chapter 1 if you have your bible we'll have you turn to the word amen thank you amen brothers and sisters for all that good music amen genesis chapter 1. amen we'd like to just carry on from where we were this morning amen i trust that the word was a blessing to you amen and we just had a wonderful afternoon got to go and have lunch amen with the johnsons and dedicated their new home to the lord so that's why we left quickly after service living there amen a little bit south of here but not too bad not too far so we certainly enjoyed ourselves amen with that i got two announcements i'd like to make before we read our scripture uh one of them and let me just find make sure i get this uh get this right and don't mess this up here so one of them is this coming weekend next weekend uh brother joe adams amen will be with us so i know he certainly has been such a blessing amen him and sister jessica when they came last time we just got such good reports there of what the lord did through our brother joe and they've been through a lot here recently there in louisiana both him and sister jessica actually got coveted thankfully they recovered from it that was weeks ago now doing a lot better now but uh brother joe will be coming this coming weekend um and then i messed up personally i'll go ahead and take the blame for it i messed up on the schedule and i double scheduled two preachers on accident but it's all right the lord understands and knows so brother joe will be here this weekend coming weekend this coming weekend brother joe adams the following weekend we're going to have brother andrew glover now i'll be here during that time but brother andrew glover will be speaking i invited him to go to come months ago then covet happen and he's such a just a fine brother he's he's well sought after you've got to book him months in advance to get him and so i'm so excited brother glover's preached her before hasn't he i think one time brother aaron told me that he had spoke here and so i know you'll enjoy brother andrew he's just just a wonderful preacher just a wonderful brother amen really just has a wonderful ministry and so i'm looking forward to hearing that myself also that weekend will be the weekend of the 25th and so that weekend i'd like to start i've already we have some things in motion i'll announce tonight don't have all of the details yet but we'd like to start our children's sunday school that sunday and so that's sunday the 25th we're going to have this is this is not the full announcement you'll get you'll get the full one coming once we structure it how we want but we're going to have two groups we're going to have a junior class and a senior class the junior class will be ages 4 to 9 years old and then the the senior class will be ages 10 to 16 years old now if you have any reservations or anybody listening by way of archive or online you have any reservations about sending your kids to sunday school with covid and that's completely understandable so we understand that we we want to go ahead and have it felt led to do this and so i just was looking to this weekend would be a good time so the 25th lord willing hold that in prayer lord will and we're going to do that that'll be ages 4 to 9 and ages 10 to 16. i'm going to have two groups and i know i'm gonna get a lot of questions about what time i don't know all those details yet i can tell you that i would like the young people the youth the sunday school class to be in church i don't like a sunday school class where they're having sunday school while we're having church i believe it's important for kids to be in church so we can work that out at a very minimum the class would dismiss before the ministering of the word begins now what i'd prefer if we could make it work would be for even them to come even 15 minutes before the saw into this get 15 minutes of worship uh amen and then go into the the sermon the ministering of the word but we want to make sure that happens don't really know yet um so um still just we're still just working out some details about that another thing that i'm i'm praying about uh and so i don't know if this will happen that same weekend uh but i'm praying about possibly starting an adult sunday school class like they do like they did in jeffersonville for years with brother collins and at the same time that the children's class would happen we'd have an adult bible study sunday school class here and the sanctuary and so the kids would have a class and the adults would have a class we do that in beaufort and it's been such just a blessing you take a topic that is not preaching at all just teaching as best that you can take a real bible topic a real bible study maybe a question someone would have and be a good opportunity for that that be okay i don't know if we're gonna do that yet but just be praying about that that's uh just upon my heart and so uh so we'll see definitely the the kids sunday school class if that was the take place we'd do it on the same weekend and of course the 20 uh 5th is what i said is that right is the 25th of sunday can somebody help me out on that i think the 25th is a sunday brother jordan i thought you just know that off the top of your head and so i thought the 25th okay good that is good so the 25th we'll start that and uh i will teach that first adult sunday school class if we have it if we go forward with it regardless the kids class will begin that weekend so be in prayer amen and expectation for that you love the lord jesus amen i'd like to um there are some things that we can do some things that we can't do we want to have wisdom and be careful about we're praying about young people's services for the for the youth uh to have some youth meetings but just really trying to be um prudent in what we do could you turn me back up brothers lost the volume don't know why up here it sounded great before there we go thank you um but we're trying to be real prudent about what we do and just to take caution but we i do believe that it's important for the family of god young and old to uh not be separated but to be together amen to have unity if anything this uh this pandemic has done is it separated people and uh separated people from church and i don't like that i know the lord doesn't like that he's got all things in control but but i just i love to come together i love as much as we can do as much as possible while remaining safe and and prayerful and as we've said many times we've just took taken everything as best we can by prayer and consideration and it's a it's a moving target you don't just uh make one decision and stick with it you sort of have to move as it moves and so things seem to be slowing down and uh getting better and opening up more and more and more we're thankful very grateful for that all right that's all the announcements i had amen you come to hear the word say amen amen uh genesis chapter one we'd like to just pick up right where we were right where we left off this morning so god created this is verse 27 of genesis 1. so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them verse 28 next next verse there brothers and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth turn to genesis chapter 2 we just want to read here also in verse 7. genesis 2 7 and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul heavenly father we thank you lord for yet again another opportunity that we have to serve you to be in your service lord lord to do something for the kingdom of god for your purposes we just ask lord that you would sanctify our vessels our lips lord the words that we'll say are thoughts and god would you get glory lord in the service here tonight lord those that are here gathered lord with an expectation to hear from you lord i pray for those that couldn't be here those that are online may be listening later by archive i pray lord the word would just meet their expectation we ask granted lord to everyone here we ask in jesus name amen you can be seated we said this morning that if you notice here in genesis 1 27 the bible says that god created man in his own image the image of god created he and so none of the animals we know from the bible were created in the image of god only man something was unique different about man about male and female they would be created in the image of god and the bible says as we said here that he breathes the breath of life into this vessel this human that he's created in his image and we know that the first human here the first original type this was the seed chapter as we said this morning the book of beginnings that the this first man adam the bible says was created a living soul and god creates him and and forms him and he was he was uh brother branham says he was just a he was perfect he was beautiful his his the way that god created him and it was was as far as as far as a a person he was non-perishable there was no disease there was no uh very different than the body that you live in today in the body that you come into the world in as you get older you're reminded of how much corruption is in your body as your body begins to fail and if you're if your body doesn't fail then your mind will begin to fill and and and the body is ever decaying it's ever in a cycle of a curse it's it's under a curse just as much as the earth is under a curse our bodies live under a constant curse uh curse with can be our bodies can become sick they can age they do age and and they can die and so the bible says but this man was was he wasn't a baby uh god didn't create him and he came in the form of a babe uh neither was he an old man elderly in age there was no age but we understand that this was prior to time so time is a bottle brother branham said it that way he said time was like a little bottle uh a a a a a time a body of time a beginning and an in a segment we measure it by literally so we look at it from the beginning like a line like a linear line but in the beginning here there was no there was until the curse uh this was and he was an eternal attribute of god he wasn't a baby and adam wasn't an old man but he was a young man that's why brother branham says that when you get your glorified body he says you'll be at the prime of life and what age is that 18 19 20 something like that the prophet thought something about that he said he looked like they were about when he goes beyond the curtain of time and he sees people in glorified bodies they were he didn't know that the ages said it was just they were there was just such beauty uh such he said it's just just a they were in the prime of their life and so a god you notice this man uh here you have a son the first son that this man adam and and who was his parent who was his father the creator it was god jehovah jehovah it was it was that eternal attribute that elohim who was this self-existing one now has expressed himself into creation can you say amen tonight but a son looks like his parent right so it's a son looks like his but the father doesn't look like the son the son you don't say uh to a father boy you look a lot like your son no no your son looks a lot like you and so a son is an attribute he came from something and the genes are passed down and so so the the son looks like his parents and he's his very being his image is in his own father's likeness he acts like his father he speaks like his father he thinks adam didn't have a mind of his own his mind was synchronous with the heavenly father and so what what mind is eve you say well then what mine does eves have brother madam says eve had the same mind she she he she would say to it to a tree uh that tree should be picked up and planted over here and adam would say that's exactly what i was thinking because she was in tune in harmony what did brother branham say says the bride of christ has the mind of god is this what the prophet said she knows what he wants done with his word and so he's is very being he acts he speaks like his father adam could do everything he could walk on water he could speak he could say tree be uprooted and be planted over there it was natural it came as his first nature now we live under a fallen nature it doesn't come under our first nature our first nature is carnal it's enmity the bible calls it with the things of god the carnal mind is enmity it's like oil and water it doesn't mix the carnal mind is enmity with god come on i need your amens here tonight there's a it doesn't it doesn't bible says it this way nor can it even know the things of god that's why the carnal mind an unregenerate person who isn't born again what did brother branham say about he says you send them you send them to cemetery what he was calling seminary and he says and one who's already dead then you pump them full with theology if they if they've never had the experience by the baptism of the holy ghost all they can do is pile on intellect and intellectual knowledge but intellectual knowledge produces death you know intellectual knowledge of this produces death learning this the bible says ever learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth because the truth is is not a the tr no one has rights on the truth because the truth is a person hello what did pilate say what is truth that wasn't the right question the right question was who is truth because truth wasn't intellect it wasn't wasn't you couldn't understand it trying to understand the things of god uh intellectually that's why the bible says the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life so trying to understand it intellectually only produces death but with the spirit it produces life can you say amen and so so adam could his faith it was natural it was his first nature it's how he acted it's it was his first reaction his first instinct he had a faith faith was natural to adam it's not very natural to you it's not very natural to me you know what you know what's natural you said brother matt but you're born again yeah that's right i trust you are too now let me speak to you that are born again do you know what comes natural to you doubt not faith see but i got the holy ghost that's right but you live under in a body that is cursed hello so so adam's first nature faith was natural to adam he could speak the word and there was never a thought of doubt there was never fear the bible says in first corinthians 11 7 man is the image of the glory of god and the glory of god but the woman is the glory of the man so man is in god's image he's in his likeness and so therefore he he speaks uh like god what did brother branham say every seed would produce after its own kind if dogs dogs will bring forth dogs cats will bring forth cats and so if god reproduces himself what will god reproduce likeness the seed of his own a messiah a a a a a a an an eternal attribute of his father that's what it's what the son is he's a reflection they now you're not speaking here naturally i'm speaking spiritually that as a son of god you've been translated from this kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of his dear son you are now seated now in heavenly places in christ jesus but brother madam in tucson yeah your body is but spiritually where are you at hello and so we see that the the the bible says the woman uh who the scripture says is the glory of the man and so she was to reflect if she's a glory she's a reflection uh when the woman the bible says that the woman disobeys and listens to the serpent and so so adam adam of course couldn't deny himself that's why brother branham says god adam took her in because he couldn't deny she was a part of him so he took her in committed the actual because brother of adam said that god knew adam knew that if he couldn't destroy him because he was part of god and so as an act of redemption he brings eve unto himself you say then how what did the second adam do well the same thing the second adam brought you to himself and nailed you to a tree and crucified you brother and says i was there i was there when they crucified him i was there when when he rose from the tomb and so it was it was it was it was the characteristic of eve she had the character of this atom there was there was a there was a life that came forth it was a reflection because she's of him she's from him she has to be part of him and in order to be part of him she had to originate with him from him can you say amen and so the bible says just as we spoke to you this morning about eliezer we took a lot of time to show you that that that that the bible says that not everyone who says lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven not everyone who says lord lord there will be many as we read to you in isaiah 4 7 women who take a hold of one man many who profess the name of christ many of them who are saved but that doesn't mean that they're elect and it doesn't mean they're redeemed and and that doesn't mean they have the holy ghost you say how how can how can we have the holy ghost today because brother branham says only the elected can be reborn because what is the nat what is the rebirth that the baptism of the holy ghost is the new birth and what happens when a person is born again that seed that was in them before the foundation of the world takes life what is the baptism of the holy ghost it's when the seed of god is quickened to life say when did i get that seed when i was at an altar no when i was born no actually way beyond that in the back part of god's mind that's election you were pre-you'll never understand election till you understand predestination what is election election isn't the way we would think because we're about to have an election here and what is an election it's based upon votes which are based upon what people like and the merits of one candidate but that's not the election that's the kind of god the kind of election that god does god's election is eternal jacob have i loved he saw have i hated and this per this decision paul says was made before either were born or either had done right or wrong go read your bible and he says that election might stand so election was in the back part of god's mind it's eternal that's why the prophet says if you he says you you didn't he says act and he picks this up in the sumerian church age he says even in in the upper room and he says peter he says they they didn't he says they didn't become sons on the day of pentecost they always were sons they only recognized who they were you didn't become a son by the infilling of the holy ghost you only recognized i'm not a chicken i'm an eagle you only recognize i'm not an alcoholic i'm a son of god i'm not part of this world i'm from another world you don't become a son by the birth you are reborn because you're a son and daughter of god that's why you're filled with the baptism of the holy ghost that's why because you've got a seed down inside of you and in that seed is the potential because a person can can go their whole life and and and never that seed never quick until the very last could be could be to the very end very last breath that they breathe it shouldn't ha it doesn't have to be that way but we know that the bible says that that that there's a but yet and we we to we we we've we've showed you all through the scripture you can go all the way from genesis and adam and eve you can move into the song of songs that's what the hebrew bible calls the song of solomon it was the song of songs in other words it was like the king of kings the lord of lords the song of songs it was the song of all songs it was his greatest writing and what was it about what was it about it was about a groom and a bride a husband and a wife a love affair what was the story of esther about what was the story of ruth and naomi about oh friends do you catch it here what was paul saying in ephesians when he said behold i speak of a mystery of christ and his bride and so this this theme is laced all the way out you move into the book of revelations now what do you have in revelations you have the end you have the beginnings in genesis you have the end in revelation the alpha the omega in the beginning there's a there's a there's a dominion an eden you have a husband adam you have a wife eve what do you have in revelation instead of an eden you have a new jerusalem and instead of adam and eve you have a bride and her groom the lord jesus christ you have the bride the spirit and the bride say come we read with you in revelations 21 it's it's it's a story it's a love story that's why we said the bible is a book of marriage it's a love story but it's only written it's only those who are part of the love story can catch that it's a love story only those who are part of that you know why because you need you know there could be a there could be a a secret mission for all you know right now you know somewhere in in nevada there's a helicopter taken off with secret service agents or sills you know navy seals you don't know we don't know that you know you know why we don't they could be going on a special mission for all we know you know why we don't know because we don't need to know you know who knows about that mission those who are on a need to know basis you know why the rest of the world looks at the message and can't see anything in it but you see something about it because you needed to know hallelujah and because you're on a need to know basis no one else knows about it but god's secret elected family of god has been made privy to the secret things of god because you needed to know and so who is she she's the bride of christ she's a called out body a holy remnant who is this as we read this morning brother ram says who is it i don't know i hope i'm one i hope you all i hope there's many here it'll be one it'll be individuals it won't be a group it won't be some certain it won't be some certain certain group of people is it going to be in tucson is going to be jeffersonville where is it going to be where do we need what are they asking brother brandon after the seals brother and should we pack up should we move to tucson should we show you one person say this brother adam says you've missed all of it you missed everything he goes on further even after the seals are broke and he says he says what he says i'm not sure anyone even called it and he says what happened there in the corner national forest what happened uh there they missed it they're still scratching their heads that's exactly what he said he said they're still wondering what happened and god had already spoken god had already called out a bride and the rest of the world just kept going but someone got someone's attention i'm glad it got mine and so it's compromised as we said it comprises of all nations of all tongues of all people of the entire world of all ages not just this age there wasn't just a bride in this age there's been a bride throughout every age and and brother branham says that it he says even that that bride of the ages he calls for that in the preview of the church and he says then i seen this modern american church and he said just filthy rickies and raquettas he said if i ever seen a bunch he said just twisting and shaking and he says i bowed my head and he says and he says i just thought he says here they were barely just something gray covering them almost nude and he says and this is the church of america and brother man says i bowed my head i thought lord after all the preaching after all the ministry after the gospels went short of shore sea to sea he says this is the best and he says just a group we're dancing to the time of rock and roll being led by a witch that's what he's seen in the vision he says she was being led by a witch and he says as they they and the way brother ran him in three different places he speaks of this and he says they i watched them as they descended over like an edge or like it was like a canyon and he says following that witch as they went off into the abyss and he said i just bowed my head he said then the voice spoke and said but the bride will come into preview again and he said and here they were he said that spotless clothed in white group marching to the beat of own word christian soldiers and he says and i watched them what was it it was it was that bride from every age and then this last age and he says i watched them and he says as they he says then at the very end of the line he says at the very end of the line he says a few of them a few at the very end started getting out of step now what kind of step were they were they getting out of step two they were out of rhythm they were out of rhythm you're marching to the beat of onward christian soldiers oh friend my brother it's not about a song i hope you catch it it's not about a song it's not about music it's it's typing something greater that their lives were marching to the beat of the gospel there were they were synchronous they were in sync they were sensitive they were discerning they were standing they were holding the banner of truth and he says but the last few of them at the very end of the line started getting out of rhythm started getting out of step and you go and find one place brother branham says why they started watching that other church that was being led by a witch and he said this their eye wasn't that they got that wasn't that they were following that system we don't follow the denominational system but he says their focus their attention they started watching that other group let me say this to you today we can we can play you videos you got the video from the pastor in kentucky that's wonderful dana coverstone and his his dreams that he's had wonderful uh could they have significance for the mat they very may well but let me remind you that's not your message you've already received your message and your messenger there's no other message coming there's no other messenger coming so what do you sweat your sweatshirt what are you saying keep your eyes on the word don't let your eyes off on that other system they're going to do what they're going to do keep your eyes on the promise keep your eyes marching to the beat of onward christian soldiers don't let nothing distract you don't let nothing distract you now let me say this fathers mothers don't let nothing distract you because just in a moment you become distracted and those little kids those little children are grown up as teenagers so don't let nothing distract you stay focused uh in a moment in the twinkling of an eye our bodies can be changed so stay focused don't be distracted by the world don't be distracted by this life this life can become distracting you may be nothing in sin nothing sinful but you can become distracted by life jesus says that it says the cares of this life choke the word and it becomes a freedom another place he says he says that uh uh that they'll that that dale catch you unaware he says lest your heart should be charged with the sir fighting and drunkenness with the cares of this not alcohol the cares of this life so don't be distracted oh i just feel the inspiration of the holy spirit to nail that down don't be distracted by anything keep your eyes focused stay focused stay alert keep your eyes on the promise you for the warning the angel lord gave brother branham there in the third and the third pool and he says he says the he says there i i was trying to trying to you know fish and he says and i threw out my line and he says i was you know i was just fishing there and and he says and and those brothers who are with are saying you can do it brother adam oh you can do it you can do it and he says and i got excited i jerked the line i remember that and he says in the line if you ever use the baitcaster uh uh fishing pole you know what it means to you know to to get your line tangled if you don't if you that thumb stop you don't get it on there quick enough and that water that bait hits the top of the water that line just keeps spinning and man you got a you got a crow's nest and you got to try to take it out and it can just be could ruin your fishing trip and brother branham says my line became all tangled and the line just kept unwinding and he says and i thought and he says then that voice who had been behind me stepped in front of me and said don't get your line tangled in these kind of times don't get your line tangled in these kind of times let that be the message to you tonight don't get distracted and that's more important than it was last year don't get distracted right now stay focused church i say lord don't let me get distracted by anything not by life not by trials not my storms not my problems not by what's going to happen tomorrow or what didn't happen yesterday let me stay focused on the word of god now more than ever before let me be a bride who's waiting and watching for the manifestation and the word of the word in my own life can you say amen tonight so god has a preparation this holy bride uh that the scripture speaks about all the way throughout the whole bible and he's preparing that bride for what for the marriage the marriage supper of the lamb where he'll introduce just as he introduced eve to adam he'll introduce he'll present that's what the scripture says that he may present to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle and so you say brother matt what is bride character what is a characteristic let me give you some characteristics of the bride the bride a bride character is that you have a passion for jesus christ there's a passion i i can't i have no other way to describe that than to say there's a passion that she has that something some part of her when brother begins to describe that ephesian age who lost the love of god and he says what did they lose they lost their passion for the word they lost something he says the cry for reaching out in the spirit all began to fade and that church became formal and he says they read they lost their passion you know you can be passionate people i have met people who are passionate about their life dreams they're passionate about something ever seen someone met someone who's passionate yeah sure you have every single one of you are passionate about something just may not be passionate about the same things i'm passionate about some people are passionate about their job passionate about their home passionate about their career passionate about sports passionate about something some recreation passionate about hunting passionate about fishing oh no brother man no you didn't yes i did you can take something that's not sinful and make it sinful by letting it become an idol that stands between you and god and you prostitute your time to it that's the words of a prophet you give yourself so much to it now that was free that wasn't on my nose but they have a passion that's that's that's the first sign of bride character she's not a lukewarm as i hear the words of a prophet in the ladies in age she's not going to be he says who's that bride going to be she won't be a lukewarm hallelujah she won't be lukewarm she won't be cold she won't be half-hearted she won't be in one week and out the other she'll be passionate about the lord in his word she'll have a passion she'll have a passion she's loved why because she's in love she's in a love affair she's love sick for her lord she wants her lord that's what marks the bride is that they love the lord they want the lord they want his word but they don't want just an intellectual understanding they want him they want his person they they they you say what is it brother man they're marked by their love rather than their knowledge the bride of christ is marked by their love for the lord not their knowledge for the lord not their knowledge of him but him can you say amen it's at the church you look at the church world today it's it's it's it's spiritual death i ruined you say but how do they get to that spiritual uh state of death by an incessant pursuit of knowledge but they missed him they have all the knowledge and they fill all their minds with all some of the most intellectual preaching uh uh articulate gifted men with a great articulate beautiful sermons with perfect theology a master's degree you know to get a master's in theology you got to know five languages i can barely speak one brother aaron you got to know five you gotta do five there by the man are you criticizing them no i'm not because you know why that's what they're called to be and they've got a purpose and god has a plan i'm not any better than they are hello nothing of myself brother branham says it that way says you're he says you're you're you're loved in the beloved it's only the love of christ that makes you different than anybody else they're known by their knowledge not their not their intellect not their theology bible schools cemeteries seminaries if you want to call them filled with teachers and students who spend years engrossed in doctrines and and and the inerrancy of the bible and the infallibility and all the textual variants of all the different languages and all the ways it was translated all of those things are good brothers and sisters don't don't let me don't take me wrong those things are fine but that's not who the bride is the bride doesn't want knowledge she wants him can you say amen tonight the bride doesn't she it's good to know but it's better to know him paul said to know him as life that's why the brother of adam says i may not know his book but i know the author i mean you know that's such an amazing thing because he knew the book really well knew the book really well but yet it was a man who was humble enough to just say i may not know the book as you know the book but i know the author of the book you say brother matt what are you uh are you preaching against that intelligence no no no no no not preaching against education it's good good to have education you're preaching against learning more about the bible absolutely not it's what i spend my life doing learning learning more about about about the the mysteries in the in the message learning more about the mysteries revealed by the message that came out of the bible no i spent my life doing it love it it's my passion love studying the word of god but let me just say this it's that ins is a lady a seeing lukewarm church the church that intellectually has everything right knows how to knows how to do everything for anybody uh uh can and you know has has some of the greatest programs some of the greatest resources there they're they're rich the bible says that they're rich and increase with goods have need of nothing have everything covered have their in their in their church staff they have psychologists and psychiatrists and counselors and and just everything you could think of in school programs and after school programs and day cares in the church and and and and all kind you say programs they outshine us by by by ten to one by programs but they're the the this is exactly what the bible describes let me just say this there's never been a church an age knowledgeable with more access to information that was the dawning of information where you can just google anything and and find it on on good old brother wikipedia and it's the gospel truth apparently everybody thinks so then you just know everything does that mean everything's right oh boy if you believe that you you don't believe nothing you don't believe in anything hello well how do you know it's true google and no one may never say it but their lives reveal what they really believe they ain't living in expectation like he's coming tomorrow hello that's what brother branham says he says they they plant your potatoes like he's coming in 100 years but live like he's coming tomorrow a lot of people love that i'm planting my potatoes but are you living like he's coming tomorrow you took one part you didn't you left off the other i'm planting my potatoes i'm just going to keep on building the business going to keep on building my homes and i'm just planting my potatoes but but are you living how's your life are you living an expectation like he's coming in the morning or do you have you taken prey to this spirit of delusion that comes in the last day of he just delayeth is coming and and and you know what that does you know when a person loses their that when a person loses their expectancy of the lord is coming could come in the morning you know what that does immediately you lose your intensity and your love and your zeal and your passion for the lord because he's just coming any old day doesn't really don't really know you live life to the fullest you get everything you can out of life and as quick as you can and as much as you can sadly this is the state of many people who sit on church pews living confessing oh i believe the lord could come but their life shows that they don't really believe that they they really don't i mean you know if you really believe that you'd be at church every time the doors are open oh man might have to just go under here brother aaron and preach from behind here make sure no one throws nothing at me can you say man hey confess it but they don't live like it live like it's coming tomorrow there's an expectation it's bright character she believes that he's coming in the morning he can come at any moment notice what it says in matthew 25 this is the parable of the ten virgins it says while the bridegroom tarried notice while the bridegroom tarried this is matthew 25 verse 5. while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept what produced slumber and sleep drowsiness and laziness spiritually when the lord's just in that delay in that terry uh but but but the bride what is bright character she's awake she's arising she's shining she's in expectation why because she's in the word she's feeding on the word and the words giving her life and the words giving her revelation and she knows he could come at any moment i see his signs appearing around everywhere his signs are appearing but while the bridegroom tarried they slumbered and slept peter says it this way in second peter 3 12 looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god where in the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved in the elements shall mur melt with fervent heat so what is it he's he's coming soon how are you going to live your life like he's coming soon say what about those who died and they lived like he was coming soon brother branham answers that question and he says those that went in the grave and he says if they went into a grave expecting the coming of the lord they come out of that grave with the same expectation in their heart he says they come out and they expect and they see what they expect how long are you going to expect till i breathe my last breath he said brother man is he coming if he's not coming as we said this morning then why do i feel him in my heart why do i hear his footsteps why do i hear his voice is the lord jesus coming i believe it's now closer than it's ever been before for now as the bible says for now your salvation is nearer than it's ever been before you say how do you know because i can feel it in my heart because there's a yearning there's a burning and i didn't put that there god put that there there's a deep calling to a deep and there's got to be a deep to respond to the cry that i feel there's a yearning for the holy spirit oh do you feel that church there's a yearning and a pulling to tell me get away from the world get away from the things of the world get don't don't get distracted don't get your eyes focused on the world and the entertainments of the world but get your eyes on jesus get your eyes on jesus you can hear the words of the lord if you listen if you listen close get almost here you can almost hear those those uh golden bells if you listen close you can almost hear that angelic choir if you listen close you can almost hear as paul said we are surrounded by a cloud of many witnesses who are those witnesses that's my grandfather who went to a grave believing for the coming of the lord he's in the cloud of witnesses saying lay aside all the weights of the world don't be distracted don't get your line tangled up but lay aside the weights of the world get your eyes focused on jesus get your eyes focused on the lord be like mary magdalene who the bible begins to speak of in john first and in john chapter 20. if you want to turn there john 20 verse 1. we're going to close here just bear with me give me a couple more minutes here this is this is a woman who loves the lord it's a woman who's passionate she's a type of the bride who's passionate for the lord she wants him she hasn't she has affections it's it consumes her this woman uh the bible says that the scripture says that she comes in john 21 the first day of the week i want you to notice this here for a minute mary now here's what mary magdalene wasn't mary magdalene wasn't an intellectual wasn't educated per se but you know what her life was marked by her lovation and her affection for the lord she was a woman who who the bible says that that she's now noticed this a lot because you you can get confused on these which mary this is mary magdalene here and that the scripture says this is the woman whose demon spirits were cast out of this is that mary she's got a lot to be grateful for he's got a lot to love the lord for us he's got a lot to live for jesus for because he did so much for her and and the bible says that here she comes and and and and let me just find my place here in the scripture it says the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene early when it was yet dark unto the sepulcher and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre this was a bin uh bible historians believe at about four o'clock in the morning she's up early in the dark in the night she comes there early now you notice who's absent peter any of the rest of the disciples doesn't say the church was gathered at the sepulcher early but one woman out of the many won one is an expectation one is in travail one is looking for the lord sleeping where's peter where's the rest of the disciples while the others slept early when it was yet dark and the bible says she sees the stone rolled away and then his body's not there and so she she runs and she she finds peter and john and the disciple says that the bible says that that all of peter and the rest of the disciples come to the tomb and they see the linen uh cloth and it's verse eight i think it is and it says they they see the linen cloth and it's folded and then when also that the other disciple which came first to the sepulcher and he saw and believed oh so they see all this they hun here's what they knew he's not there it's not there and the bible says then they then he saw and believed you know what they're remembering they're now they're remembering the words of jesus now they're remembering what he told them now they're seeing and believing and the scripture says in verse 10. now notice this verse 10 and it says then the disciples went away again unto their own home left came to church he's not there he's risen now we're going to lunch i mean home now we're going home the bible says they were they he's not there he's not in the tomb they see that they in fact go further and the bible says they believed and now that they go back home but but you know you see that so much today my brother and my sister people are just content with coming and believing he's resurrected we came for the honors resurrection we're here now we're going home some people don't you know some people only show up for easter and for christmas and for holidays where are they the rest of the year they go home they're satisfied with the knowledge oh i hope you catch it they're satisfied with the knowledge that he's not there that he's resurrected but mary magdalene's not satisfied with that knowledge she wants to know where is he where is my lord where have they taken him i want to have him not just the knowledge of his resurrection i want to know where is my lord she's one woman a bride type of the bride who's an expectation not just with the knowledge that he's not there but she says where's he at mary stood the bible says in verse 11. now the disciples verse 10 the disciples went away again into their own home but verse 11. but mary stood without at the sepulcher weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked what's wrong mary what's wrong what's bothering you why are you crying he's not there he's risen go home go home mary he said enough to know it's enough to know that he's not theirs you've seen the linen cloth you see he's not there he's risen just like he said what's wrong mary the bible says mary stays disciples go but she stays she stood without the sepulcher weeping why because for mary's world this was her world for her the world without jesus was not a world she wanted to live in the world without him not the knowledge of him not the intellect of him but without having him it wasn't worth living and mary said i'm going to stay here because this is the only spot i've came to the end of everything unless i have him what does the song say because he lives i can face tomorrow because i know yes i know oh he holds my future then life is worth the living just because he lives verse 13. notice what mary begins to say here and they say unto her woman why weepest thou she said unto him because don't you know how important this is you know what you're seeing you're seeing a bride who's passionate you see you know you're not seeing a woman who's casual and i've seen a woman who's distracted and her mind's on a thousand other things she's focused she's laser focused you've seen a woman who's passionate she says because they have taken away my lord and i know not where they have laid him i know not or they have laid him and nothing is going to satisfy me nothing's going to satisfy me until i know and the bible says in verse 12 and verse look at verse 11 go back to verse 11. trump says but mary said without the second girl weeping and she wept she stooped down and looked at the sepulcher verse 12 and it says it says and seeth two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet wherein they laid where in the body of jesus said lane verse 13 the verse we just read and notice what it says here and as she wept she stooped down look at the sepulchre seeing the two angels now notice here's here's the rest of everybody at home here's the rest of everybody content and now because because mary stayed she gets a visitation from angels the rest of them didn't get this brother aaron brother peter didn't get it the rest of the disciples didn't get it they were home but one woman because she was passionate for the lord who does the lord reveal himself to say i want though if i could just hear from the lord how much do you wait on him i just want to see the lord how much do you look for him really i didn't see the lord when i went to church well what'd you come looking for how often do you wait in in prayer friend i know it's so simple but i just want to challenge you tonight how passionate we're the bride of jesus christ how passionate are we really how much do we want to see him what does it mean to us it ought to mean everything it ought to we ought to be totally devoted completely sold out to see in the lord every day in our life she turned the bible says in verse 14 scripture says now notice this verse 14 the next verse brother it says she turned herself back and and and so and when she had this uh and when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw jesus standing and knew not that it was jesus jesus said unto her woman notice what he calls her woman now she doesn't respond to that that does nothing for her doesn't open her eyes she's still blind to who he is doesn't see it's jesus woman why we piss now ask the same question whom seekest thou she's supposing him to be the gardener said in him sir if thou had borne him hence tell me where thou has laid him and i will take him away what did she want she wanted him for herself she said if no one else can have it if no one can have him i can have him if no one else can get him i want to have him he's mine oh as the song says mine mine mine jesus is mine mine when i'm weary mine when i'm dreary this is what mary was saying i want him for myself verse 16 jesus said unto her mary now he's no longer calling her woman why because he first comes to her at a voice that she can't recognize as many times the lord pushes upon your heart and he doesn't reveal himself until you accept him and let him in and then he says mary because what did he see seen a passion about her that she wanted him not his knowledge not his books not not his intellect not anything about him not the history of him not the miracle of yesterday she wanted hume and the bible says he said unto her mary she turned herself and said unto him rabboni which is to say now the same voice but now she recognizes it notice he called her by name why because he knows you by name he knew mary by name it wasn't just going to be woman it was going to be bride that's why brother adam says i no longer call you church you got a name your name is bride elected lady the elected lady of god mary and now she hear something's different about that voice you see something changes when you really press into god something changes i'm speaking very naturally here just for a moment as we close musicians could you come something changes you know there's a certain there's a certain threshold that you can cross brother branham preaches a message and he calls it a hidden life in christ and he he speaks about that life that's that's that's hidden hidden away the lord and you know what you're in your knowledge of the lord i've felt it many times i can't tell you i can't testify to you enough how many times i've got down on my knees and begin to speak to the lord just uh just a recent memory here just beginning to speak to the lord i knew the lord was listening saying how do you know the lord is listening because the bible tells me that he's listening he said did he stop and say i'm listening no but i believe his word and his word says he listens he says this is our confidence when we pray he hears our prayer i began to pray and just and begin to just talk to the lord you know just begin to pour your heart out to the lord as you can do in your own way many times it's happened and and and and prayers and you pray and you're pouring your heart to the lord and i knew the lord was listening the lord is hearing him and let's begin to to worship many times in prayer i'll just in the middle of my prayer i'll just start singing worship to the lord and then go back into prayer then go back into psalm and go back into prayer maybe you do it a different way but in each his own way and and and you know many times i've i've got down on my knees and i've prayed and talked to the lord felt like i'd made my positions known and i said amen the prayer was i left i left it at the lord and i went on but you know there's been there's been times when i've prayed and i've talked to the lord i know he's listening and i just begin to pour my heart out sinks onto the lord and then suddenly something changes and it's like the whole atmosphere and the whole room in my living room just completely changed and i know this this isn't this isn't this wasn't like it was one second ago and i could feel the nearness of the holy spirit the lord to settle down and it's and and and you can you just know the presence of god is there right now begin to pray [Music] just once i knew the lord was in the room that i really began to just let it all out just let it all out said lord now i know you're here now i know you're listening so i'm going to tell you everything i've been wanting to tell you i'm going to tell you all my problems i'm going to tell you everything i'm facing i'm going to i'm going to pour out my heart about everything i'm going to because i don't have anyone else to talk to that can really help me in the way you can help me so now lord now that i know you're listening now you just take a moment to let me just let me just cry out to you and what i need what i what what what's happening in my own life and i knew the holy spirit was listening can just feel the presence of the lord you just feel so small you know what it is it's oppressing to where just like he spoke to mary and he calls her woman and then it changes and he says mary and then everything changes that's happened he said brother matt that happens in prayer it does you can cross brother branham says you can go deep enough in the lord in prayer many times people have i testified you before you know many times that's happened to me the lord i'll start speaking in tongues right in my prayer closet you say why does that happen well i don't know the lord decides that it's going to happen and it happens many times it's not tongues many times it's tears tears are a language god understands you may not speak in tongues paul said not all speak with tongues you may speak with tears but there's something different it's not just words it's not just a prayer that you're praying it's not just singing you know many times in worship i've been sitting in a church pew and come to church after church service and praise and raise my hands but then there's some unique special times when i feel the presence of god charge me like an electricity like an electric bolt going through my body and now it's no longer woman it's mary no longer son it's matthew and he speaks my name and i know it's the lord and it's a special experience say brother man i want to have that i believe the bride of jesus christ bride character is is that's a desire you could raise your hand and say i desire that lord i desire to speak to you in a special way oh could you stand and raise your hands i believe i got true sincere honest hearts maybe you raise a hand with your head bowed every eye closed and you could say lord i want to know you in that way i don't just want it to be woman i want it to be merry so that i recognize the voice behind the voice so that i hear the voice behind the voice so that i see the god behind skin i want to know you in that way lord i want the relationship to be that real yes lord yes jesus that's you lord that's you speaking to her that's you speaking to him that's not me that's the holy spirit speaking to you sister that's the holy spirit speaking to you brother that's the presence of god trying to press down upon you all you got to do is let him in just let him in say lord i invite you to come i invite you to speak i invite you to move let it go beyond just a lip let it go beyond a word let it go beyond hands let it go beyond being in a church service let it go into the deep chambers of that third realm that touches beyond the the the body it goes beyond the emotion and it contacts the soul where my seed is oh god i pray you'd speak to every life lord i know i i'm so lord aware of your divine presence right here in this building right now for any of those that want to reach out and touch you you're passing by lord you're passing by you want to speak their name tonight bride character i want to have that i just want to raise my hand lord with these people and say let that be my character oh god let me have the character of that expectant wading bride let me have that humility of spirit not that pridefulness of self that i'm so tangled up with in this human body let me lay down my pride as the prophet said take your pride throw it on the ground and stomp it with your feet stomp out all of your pride [Music] let me throw it down lord let me accept you let me accept your word let me hear your voice lord that's my prayer jesus that i may know you in that special way that i may see my place and my identity that it's found only in you regret it jesus granted lord jesus for every life for every heart for every home young oh lord every single one of us here as we close out this service here tonight [Music] yes that's my prayer i'm just gonna tarry just for a moment raise my hands i'm going to say yes lord oh it's such a special thing for a believer to say yes yes lord yes it's what is it it's it's an accepting accepted lord yes to your word yes to your will yes and me yes in my life yes in my home yes in my heart let it be lord take over take over my my my vessel take over my family take over my job take over my finance take over my health take over my body lord let it be completely you
