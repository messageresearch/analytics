love the church come to church on sunday morning and those that love the pastor come to church on sunday night but those who love god come to church on wednesday night how many love god tonight amen blessed be his name amen if you have your bibles like to just turn to the scriptures right off turn to matthew chapter 7 verses 1 through 5. my message tonight is titled judging righteously you ever heard the expression don't judge me anybody ever heard that had that thrown in your face don't judge me and the bible says you're not to judge and i feel like we hear this a lot in today's society and frankly i get annoyed by it sometimes i get annoyed because it's you it's it's used as a as a cop-out uh to keep someone from from any kind of accountability on their part don't judge me you're not supposed to judge judge not matthew 7 verse 1 judge not that ye be not judged for with what judgment you judge you shall be judged with what measure you meet it shall be measured to you again and why behold this thou the moat that is in thy brother's eye but consider is not the beam that is in thine own eye or how will thou say to thy brother let me pull out the mote out of thine eye and behold a beam is in thine own eye thou hypocrite first casts out the beam out of thine own eye then shalt thou be see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye father tonight lord as we open the scriptures father and speak about the word lord god we ask that you just anoint my lips my heart my spirit all that i am lord i know each one is here and those will be hearing through the through the medias or whatever they have here lord god that that or the phone systems whatever it might be that they'll be blessed lord god that it'll give us something to that we can hang on to lord in uh help us live our christian life before you we commit everything into your hands bless your people tonight i believe we've already been blessed by just being here in your presence we thank you in jesus christ's name and the church said god bless you may be seated what do people really mean they're saying don't judge me they don't want to be judged they don't want to be held accountable they want to live their life and they don't want to feel the conviction be convicted many times us by being christians and just being around them convicts them and they feel they're the spirit of the world and the spirit of christ and their contrary one to the other sometimes someone will come against you or be against you for no reason and if you were to ask them they probably wouldn't even know why they don't like you but it's just the spirit of the world it's contrary to the spirit of god and if we have the spirit of god and we're living for the lord then it's going to bring conviction to the people i can remember many years back when my son was probably about 10 years old and of course we're coming to this church here and and we had some neighbors that moved in and the father had a ponytail and and so did the sun and after a few weeks we noticed they they were clear clean cut and we found out to the grapevine that they saw me and my son the way we had our hair and how we conducted ourselves it brought conviction to them and you don't realize it i remember i remember one time i was standing outside i i had some beautiful beautiful garden in the front of the house or where we used to live on 15th avenue in tucson years ago and it had a it was like a park it had roses and beautiful lawn and everything and a fellow a neighbor that i i don't even knew him he was just four or five houses down and on a wheelchair and he came up and he started struck up a conversation with me and you know telling you how beautiful the garden was and everything and we got to talk and he said you know when you think of when you pray next time he said pray for me he says i hear you you pray beautifully and i you know that what do you hear he hear hear me pray you know and i remember i guess sometimes we'd have our family altars and i don't know if they could hear through the door or what but i'm not one i don't i don't pray in my mind i like to pray out loud i like to speak out amen just like when i read the word i like to read it out loud because hearing faith comes by hearing i want to hear myself read that word i want it's going to give me faith amen and so we find that people though just don't like to they don't like to feel that that conviction um is it true when people say i i don't judge i feel like i feel like we all judge and and really it really there's there's something the word judge can mean two different things i don't know if he ever notices but this is just my my observation that it it can be where you're condemning somebody and i believe that's why it says here judge not that ye be not judged don't condemn lest you be condemned that's what he's talking about and the other part that in my observation of judging is actually discernment we discern we're constantly judging you're judging me right now as i'm standing up here speaking to you is that right you're judging what i'm saying if i get off the word you you should know you're going to judge that you're discerning me you know and and i believe a pastor will discern the people as he greets him as they're coming in as parents you discern your children i can remember brother green given the testimony one time uh when he was taking the girls to school and and i think it was tina the youngest said when she stepped out of the car and she got among her friends her walk suddenly became different and brother green caught that i remember brother biscuit gave the testimony one time where he came home and he felt a spirit in the home and and it was one of his children and we discerned these we need to be the we need to and brother brad says we have a certain amount of discernment you you talk to someone for five minutes ten minutes and you talk about whatever the weather but after a while after a few minutes you can start discerning that person what kind of a person that is because god's given you discernment now we don't have a discernment like brother branham where you know your name where you live and all that's that's totally different but we have some discernment of spirit that god has given us um so what what is the meaning of don't judge that's exactly what it is you don't condemn don't don't be of a condemning spirit uh you see somebody coming to this church and there it may be a woman that maybe that doesn't come here and they're just visiting and she may not be dressed right and we can sit there and condemn that woman you know we can start judging her not knowing her past and brother brian even talks about the woman the prostitute on the corner and you might sit there and maybe wait for the light to turn green and she's standing there in the corner dressed as a prostitute and you could condemn her all you want but you don't know her life brilliant talks about if you could ask her what choices what brought her to those choices that she made in her life and many times we don't know like brother brandon would say until you walk in somebody's moccasins for a while then then you can understand why someone might make a certain choice or a certain decision in their life that maybe you're not in agreement with but we don't know everything i'm sure glad that god who is the judge knows everything he knows the ends he knows he out he knows the whys and the why nots of our lives and of every life and we don't know we might think we know but as you say you've heard the saying there's two sides of your coin and you might hear a story about somebody and cause you to have a certain uh feeling towards that person but you don't know the whole story and there was a certain brother and i'm not going to mention his name but from years back another church went to and that he he was a minister and he was an evangelist and he preached a lot in mexico a lot in in south america and then things started coming back to us you know of a wrong kind of testimony and for a lot of years i just had him in a certain perception and you might end up having a perception of a person by by something you heard or or maybe something you saw in the person i don't know but your perception could be so wrong and it wasn't until he passed away and i began to see because i i'm in the uh whatsapp with a lot of ministers from south america and they began to put up videos of his brother preaching the word and i mean i'm talking you know assemblies i mean a place is this big packed out and the power of god moving among the people and he's there preaching a great anointing and and it began to change my my idea and perception of the man to the point i said he was that time he was sick he wasn't dead yet but and i said lord maybe i had a wrong perception about this brother you know we just tend to be judgmental and condemning and we don't know all the ends and all the outs you might think you do but do you and we and we can we can arrive at a certain perception of somebody and condemn that person in our heart you know maybe not even ever say anything but it's there none nonetheless and god knows your heart and he says judge not lest you be judged and and the way you judge him you're going to be judged and i hear a prophet saying lord i don't want your judgment lord lord i want your mercy amen anybody here want to be judged i don't want to be judged not not not in the great white throne judgment uh i want his mercy amen now the greek word for judge means to condemn and we should not condemn anyone because we do not know what a person's eternal destination is going to be you might see somebody and think that person is is lost as lost and being but we don't know what's gonna happen further up ahead you know that that part is god's job and we're trying to get into god's uh position uh to condemn somebody or to put somebody out uh i've heard people come tell me well so-and-so i think he's serpent-seeder or so and that always rubs me wrong i just don't believe in saying that about anybody and we shouldn't because who who am i to say that so-and-so is serpent seed or to say so-and-so is not a child of god or so-and-so doesn't have the holy spirit well that i'm not i'm not the judge of that that's god's that's his that's his place it's our place if we see someone that would give us that kind of a thinking or a perception of that person maybe we should be on our knees if we have the right kind of spirit because do you want to see that person lost you know you might have someone in your mind and that someone you know that maybe he's done you some wrong and and and i'll give you one i had a son-in-law and somebody you know probably knew kevin considine and he he's keeping your prayers you know he ruined my daughter's life and sent her on her pathway that her health began to fail and and and she now she's with the lord but he's in a bad way right now he's he's taking he's a he's a meth addict he's hit the bottom of the barrel his own parents have a have a uh what do they call it a a judgment against them to keep away i forget what they call that yeah and uh and i and i have no animosity toward him i've always kept my heart clean about that not to hate him and my wife as well you know we actually we feel sorry for him we pray for him because uh i don't want him to be lost i think it'd be a wonderful thing if when it's all said and done and we're standing there in glory that he'll be there it would be a wonderful thing and there should be nobody in our on our mind or our heart that we want them to be lost you know but there's many that refuse they they don't want to be condemned and and they'll just throw that back at you you shouldn't judge me you shouldn't judge the bible says don't judge but it's because they don't they refuse to believe that there is a god because that god brings them in brings them back into accountability that's why that's why the world has gone in direction it has that's why scientists are trying to prove there is no god that's why they brought him evolution which is a lie they have believed the lie the bible says in romans and and and god's given them give them over to reprobate mind because they don't want that that accountability uh there was a man named ravi zacharias now he his ministry ended it if you know about the man it didn't end well right before he died he made some mistakes and missteps in his life but during his life he was very very intellectual man very very smart matter of fact i i can remember hearing him on the radio on sunday morning as we were driving the tucson tabernacle back in the day and he'd be on the radio on i think on the the christian station they have here and he'd be preaching i thought man this guy is really he had words that i didn't i didn't know what they meant i mean he was real intellectual very very he was indian he was from from india you know a lot of indians are very very cultured people very educated matter if you go to either go or go down to the university hospital these hospitals you you see how many indian doctors they have very educated people and he was very educated and very very intellectual he would actually go out and he would debate atheists he would debate uh uh people who who who believed in the uh professors that the pro that taught evolution he would debate them and he would debate even muslims you very very smart man and he said this it takes intelligent design to take something that is possible and make it into something natural you know the bible said that there in hebrews at chapter 11 that things were made of things that did not exist and in other words god took a whole lot of nothing and made the whole universe out of it everything we see came out of nothing when he says when you say there is no such thing as evil you must assume that there is such a thing as good now if you say there's evil then then there's you gotta assume that there's good as well and he says when you assume that there is such a thing as good you must assume that there is such a thing as a moral law to differentiate between good and evil for you to say well this is evil and this is good but where's the moral it's got to be a moral law to dictate that to us and then he says when you assume that there is such a thing as moral law you must then assume that there is a moral law giver and that's where they run into a problem they don't want to assume that that there is a moral law giver and that's what's what the atheist wants to prove that there is no moral lawgiver so there is so if there is no moral law giver there is no moral law there is no good and there is uh no evil he says so the question self-destructs you come right back down to this where either it is or it isn't if there's good then there's evil if there's good and evil then there's a moral law then there's a moral law giver then there's a god now you bring a god into the picture and if you want to do away with the moral law giver and the moral law then there is no good and there is no evil so you're right back to zero again people just don't want to be brought into accountability for their lives and that's what that's what the whole thing is about they want to disprove that there's a god they want to live their life and not have any kind of fear that one day they'll stand before a god the bible says it's a fearful thing to stand before a living god in john chapter 8 verses 15 and 16 here jesus says ye judge after the flesh i judge no man and yet if i judge my judgment is true can you say amen to that that's jesus speaking there for i am not alone and i and the father has sent me so if he judges his judgment is true i believe when he judges the people in that day in that great day of the judgment they're going to be judged exactly as they should be judged it's going to be a true judgment uh we we we tend we judge people a lot of time we judge by what we see on the outside if you remember that when samuel was sent to go and annoy anoint david and uh and and and they're in samuel 16 verse 6 it says it came to pass when they were come that he looked on elia and said surely the lord's anointed is before him he must have seen elia must have been you i think he was the oldest and he was probably strong and square shoulders you know just powerful looking and tall and and but the lord said unto samuel look not on his countenance nor on the height of his stature because i have refused him for the lord seeth not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but the lord looketh on the heart we see the the an appearance of a person and we don't we don't know what's on the inside we just see the outside maybe we see some of their actions i mean and we disagree with them and it gives us a perception of that person you know we've all heard the expression don't judge a book by its cover but we do that we do it very often i remember brother caleb duron told me one time he had gone to a to a a halfway house to go see somebody there and he was met at the door by this guy came he filled the whole door he was about six foot six big man tattoos all over his neck and everything else and you look at someone like that and that's the kind of guy you don't want to run into in a dark alley you know and he said when he began to talk to him he realized the man he just he was in love with jesus he began to tell him how that you know he had been a biker and he had been he'd done a lot of things in his life and he went he went to jail he went to prison and they're in prison somebody witnessed to him and he met the lord they're in prison and so he went to the gang because everybody's in gangs in in prison you gotta you gotta belong to a gang or in some of these prisons otherwise they'll kill you so he went to the gang and he said you know i don't want to do this anymore i'm not gonna be a part of this gang so they gathered around and they were going to kill him and uh and the and the leader looked at him and he said wait a minute he says looks at him he said you got jesus he said yes i got jesus all right we're going to let you go he says but we're going to be watching you you better have jesus he says never saved him he thought you he thought he was going to die and he talked to caleb and caleb was telling me man you should have seen that guy you you just look at him and make you your heart skip a beat man because this guy he looked awful but when he starts talking he was like a little teddy bear you know but you judge that book like by the cover and that's what we do many times i'm glad that god looks at the heart because sometimes we might have a a rough exterior amen i've met christians that are kind of rough on the outside you know brother green was kind of rough on the outside if you're a double brother green i love brother green i'm not i'm not against brother green i loved him he was my pastor for many years but he was a little rough i remember one time we uh we were gonna have some meetings and we had a meeting back there brother aaron probably remembers that he told us all i want you all to be here you know me brother aaron brother brother uh uh bennett and caleb and and i forget who else brother knight and so uh something came up but my daughter jessica had come from pennsylvania and she had organized this is before all this had happened uh a retreat over in flagstaff we rented the cabin already given my money buy part of the money for it my wife and i are gonna be part of that or the whole fans get together and and i had and and uh so i was gonna go tell brother green that was sunday morning and i'd walked in right after newton bennett had walked out of there and telling brother green he wasn't going to be there and brother greene just went one went upside at him and came down the other and he stepped out and then uh i met caleb at the door and he and i and caleb knew i was going to tell brother green the same thing and pick kevin said i gotta go and he just stepped right out of the office left me in there by myself and oh my he was rough but you know that's just the the exterior and on the inside he had a heart of gold he had a heart of gold so a lot of times we judge a book by its cover we we really shouldn't we should uh you know uh allow the holy spirit to bring that that that a discernment that we could have of the spirit of somebody if you know what i mean in john 7 24 jesus again says the following and this is my sermon where i took my sermon title 7 24 judge not according to the appearance but judge righteous judgment judge not according to the appearance but judge righteous judgment so how can we judge righteously and still not judge or condemn now when it comes to judging others we are not to condemn anybody but rather discern their spirit have a discernment of their life but we are constantly like i said we're constantly deserting one another if you stand you're talking back there you're there's running each other you discern people while they're dressed what what words they speak we deserve all of that we're constantly doing that in in romans 14 and 10 it says why does thou judge thy brother why does thou say that not thy brother you see now you're condemning that's condemning he said it not you're judging him you're condemning him for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ you see all of us have to be judged one way or another we're all going to be judged we'll all stand before as paul said before the judgment seat of christ galatians 6 chapters 1 verses 1-3 brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such and one in the spirit of meekness so if you see or you know something about somebody instead of going and telling everybody about that person and destroying them which happens many times you know the problem with church many times we shoot are wounded come on we shoot our wounded someone falls and you don't want nothing to do with him anymore instead of instead of reaching out to him and here paul writes brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness you see what happens is we lack humility if we had real meekness and humility amen blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth and there should be a meekness and humility about us that we don't want to we don't want any condemn anybody we want we want we want everybody to be saved he says considering thyself lest thou also be tempted because who here this this evening can say they're they're above they're above that no that you cannot be tempted that you cannot fail the bible says there is none righteous no not one we have all fallen short of the glory of god come on we've all who can stand here and and and point a finger at somebody as you say when you do that there's three pointing back at you where's that mercy where's grace that we want for ourselves can you allow that for someone else who's fallen if a man be overtaken in the fall ye which are spiritual restore such a one amen for if a man thinks himself to be something verse 3 when he is nothing he deceiveth himself if we were truly humbled before the lord and really had a perception of our own selves realizing we're nobody realizing that that without god we're nothing i don't know anything we don't know anything if you think you know something you don't know anything at all because you haven't learned yet what it is to be what it is to be spiritual is to be humble the way up with god is always down god's economy is opposite to man's economy humble yourself in the sight of the lord and he he will lift you up don't try to lift yourself up don't try to say well look at me i can do this or i can preach or i can do this i'm good at this or i'm i no no if you do that you got the wrong spirit to begin with it's like brother man was talking about a man that went up to speak and and and and when he went up there he went up there he was full of pride and thinking he was something and when he began to speak the people was not a single amen the people just looking at him and when he left he left with his head down and brother brown said had he come up the way he went down he would have gone down the way he came up do you follow me on that humility friends if we if we were more humble and when you see somebody fall this it's not to make you happy or or say ah look at that i knew it aha as brother greenwood preached one time many years ago aha got you look at that it shows the kind of spirit world james 5 19 and 20 says brethren if any of you do error from the truth and one convert him let him know that he which covered cover covereth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sins i want to be i want to be a hider of sins amen not not not a tattletale now that someone's going to go around destroying somebody's life you know brother brother brown said you talk about a pastor and to tear him down before people why don't you just take a gun and shoot him come on take a gun and shoot him you're destroying him before the people be very careful how you speak about ministry if you go back into scripture if you've read the bible you know what i'm talking what paul says the honor that you have to we should give to a minister of the gospel you know there there's some of this message they want to call them this and call them that but i see the word of god where it says it says how beautiful are the feet of them the preacher the gospel of good of peace and bring glad tidings of peace how beautiful that's god's thoughts about his about those he is called to the ministry be very careful how you speak about and not just minister but anyone because we're we're all children of god the bible says touch not my anointed do my prophets no harm well i'm going to tell you is more we're the anointed of god be careful what we speak what about one another that's why the bible tells us again and again again love one another love one another have pray for one another amen you shall hide a multitude of sins be careful about having a condemning spirit you know brother brown talks about they they were going to have some people come to the church and these people had a reputation of of being a little bit pentecost and they had come to put a brand what are you gonna do brother when they start doing what they do well don't worry about i'll handle it and brother brandon said he was sitting there and they started singing and the little little sister got out and she started dancing on the hall on the aisle and he said he sat there on that what do you call it the the seat of uh of what yeah amen and he was just criticizing her and the holy ghost spoke to him said maybe you don't have the victory that she's got and he began to think about that and he's sitting there and he's contemplating that probably i could just see him going like this you know just wait a minute wait a minute david danced before the lord what about marion when she took that it was a great victory in the camp and god had destroyed their enemy and she took a tamporing and the women followed her and they began right there on the red sea shores as the song goes the holy ghost will set your feet to dancing the holy ghost will thrill you through and through and he began to contemplate that he said before he knew it he was moving he was kind of just tapping his foot a little bit with the music and before he knew it he was out there dancing with her amen hallelujah got to be careful don't be don't be able to condemn your spirit allow somebody grace you want grace give grace to somebody else you want forgiveness give forgiveness to somebody else if you don't forgive the bible says god won't forgive you if you judge god's going to judge you amen but like i said in church our problem is we just shoot our wounded don't fail around here we'll destroy you we don't want you here i've heard it said many times if if uh if david would have tried to come to our church we wouldn't want that old adulterer murderer in our church yet he was he was a man after god's own heart god looked at his heart he looked through all of that all the failures that he had he had some pretty big ones too but yet with all of that god loved him and he was a man after god's own heart in the in the message adoption and number two and back in 60 brother brother brown says i went after a brother not long ago had won astray a young fellow said to me he said let that rascal go let him alone i said if i ever get to a place that my heart don't go with my brother then it's time for me to go to the altar because i've fallen from grace if we don't feel when someone someone stops coming to church that we hear that they're they're out in the world and yet nobody will take the time to go see them or call them or you know where is our love where is if we have the love of god we're going to have a love for the for god's people we don't want to see anybody fail and brother brandon said if i don't go after him i have fallen from grace i said i'll go as long as he's got breath in his body and i'll catch him somewhere along the line yes sir i caught him hallelujah brought him back yes sir he's back in the fold safely now yes sir he would have won history as sure as the world amen the message discernment of the spirit 1960 bible man says we have we have discernment of spirit to discern the spirit that's in the man to see if it be the spirit of god or not god's given us that discernment and we do that so when peop people say don't judge me but when i'm not condemning you i'm just discerning you i'm seeing some things that i think are not quite right but i'm not going to come you know sometimes how we approach someone we think we're going to we're going to help them by maybe rebuking them a little bit but you know we have to have the right words because words can hurt and i've heard it many times where someone was trying to help somebody and they didn't have the wisdom to say the right words you've got to have the wisdom if you don't have the wisdom stay away from it you'll cause more harm than good there was a brother that said that came one time and years back and he said he was telling me how that he was from california he had this gift and he he believed he had a gift that god would show him things and he had gone to a brother and and he had said some things to him and caused that brother to get very very mad at him so he came to me and i said brother i said listen whether you have a gift or don't have a gift that's that's between you and god okay i'm not gonna say you don't i said brother but if you don't have the wisdom to handle that gift you can cause more harm than good you got to have wisdom and how you do something when you when you go and you talk to somebody because you want to help them because they're going astray maybe don't go in there with a with a haughty uh attitude or or you know you just gotta go in the right kind of spirit i think you should be praying about it you should be fasting and getting the right spirit and ask god to give you the words to speak that will help that person not go and destroy him more and i've seen that too many times when one christian wants to go and help another and doesn't have the wisdom to speak the right words do you follow me on that in first john 4 1 the bible says beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world and that's what that's our job to try the spirits you have a you young people that have friends they maybe want to hang out with you try their spirits discern them if you if you have a friend you've known him for a few months or or a few years you know what he's about you you know how whether this person is is gonna be uh good for your walk with the lord or not good be careful who you walk with in school who you hang out with what friends you have who what people you hang out with where you go have deserved the spirit god's given us that discernment amen and like i said i just i never have like when someone comes and tells me while someone saw a serpent leader so-and-so is this that's not my job to condemn somebody that's god's job my job is to go out after him my job is to pray for that person my job is to be concerned about their welfare about their their spiritual welfare and also the physical welfare too many times we think more of this so we're so spiritually minded we know we're no earthly good and and we don't look at a person's maybe he has a need and we don't we and we can we could help them we don't god give us the love amen that we can bless somebody else and we you know that's how god will bless us we begin to bless others and that's how god does it you know you begin to help other people and bless other people you're gonna find god's gonna start to bless you amen in first corinthians six chapters one through seven dare any of you have a matter against another go to law before the unjust and not before the saints do you not know that the saints shall judge the world the time will come and we will judge but it's not now but there will be a time we'll stand next to the king of kings and the lord of lords as a bride of jesus christ and we're going to judge he says you he says don't you know that the saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters knowing not that we shall judge angels wow isn't this something the position that god's bringing us to but there's got to be character it won't happen without character brother brandon said power without character is satanic there's got to be the character of christ that love has got to be there that concern has got to be there for somebody's well-being here we we're islands you know everybody goes home and you're an island we don't look we don't look to our brother the bible says in philippians chapter 2 verse 3 he said look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others amen let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god platter not robbery to be equal with god and made himself a no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of man and being found in fashion as a man he what he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross look not every man on his own things that's what we do we tend to be just me or us for no more it's just me and my house and what about everybody else what about the needs that might be represented here in our in the church or in maybe in your neighborhood amen there's no there's no kindness anymore we should have a kindness one to another respect about it also fruits of the holy spirit love joy peace long suffering god uh goodness and and and to have kindness and and goodness and mercy and and and all these things that's the holy spirit began to flow through us as i think i've said before for this pope before there were channels of them of god's holy spirit flowing through us and and if we become a channel of of the holy spirit flowing through us and as brother branson says we can go from baptism to baptism from revelation to revelation growing always in the lord abounding in the things of god that love of of the lord in our heart towards every man believing in and and and trusting and and praying one for another know ye not that ye shall judge angels my my what character god is expecting us to have how much more things that pertain to this life if then you have judgments of things pertaining to this life set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church and that's something if there's a problem here in the church you know what they were doing they were taking each other to court brother robert didn't like he had something against me he took me to court and sued me and i'd be would be there among the unbelievers can you imagine what a show he said i speak to your shame is it so that there is that a wise man among you no not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren oh brother oh brother goethe to law with brother and that before the unbelievers i can remember a time in this message to our shame back during the time those who remember the the fight of the franchise and the copyright going on between jeffersonville and cloverdale and they got into the internet and they had those chat rooms back then and and message brothers were fighting each other in chat rooms and i mean putting out their dirty laundry for the whole world to see brother brandon said we fight in the backyard but when we stand in the front yard we stand shoulder to shoulder whatever happened to that we're bringing our fight to the front yard and letting everybody see what a shame that was to our shame and and the church of tennessee got involved and and i heard some of the messages were preached and i it was just to me that the i mean slamming the branham family and i mean horribly and i remember that and i thought this is to our shame why are we doing this now there for there is utterly a fault among you because he go to law with one another why do you not rather take wrong someone wrongs you why don't you just take the wrong come on why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded think about that the bible says once when they ask you i can't remember the scripture exactly but they ask you for a quote give me your cloak also when you give it to him don't expect it back and there are people that are going to do it they're going to take advantage and there are people that will do that but where do we stand in where is our heart in all of this wouldn't you rather suffer to be defrauded i remember some years back when i retired from the company i worked for 32 years and uh i'm going to be closed in a few minutes and and they owed me some back pay on vacation and the manager the lady she didn't like me for some reason i don't know why but she came back and and she said that i didn't have that much back pay and they cheated me out of several thousand dollars and uh so i left it alone i didn't fight it uh i said okay all right forget it uh i just walked away and that lady went on vacation a few about a week later after i retired and the general manager he was a pretty nice guy he had somebody else look into it and they said oh we do owe him this we owe him at least 1300 so they said they sent me he called me up we're gonna send you a check for thirteen hundred dollars well i'll take that's fine it was more on that but that's fine so they did and when that lady came back from the she was the office manager and she just she saw she was calling me sending me letters sent the money back so finally and i didn't spend the money i thought i had a feeling about it so i just put it away and uh remember i wrote a check for the exact amount and i i sent a letter and i sent it to the general manager and i told him i said you know you guys i was cheated here cheated here and this happened and there was this pension that i had that they took that away and this happened this other happened i said okay that's fine i said but you know now you want this money back here it is to the penny i said i would rather be defrauded than to defraud somebody else that's my christian belief that i have i wrote it in the letter i said i'd rather be defrauded than to defraud somebody else and i sent the money back and i said tell the lady that i consider the matter closed and so and that's that's what we should be you know that if somebody is going to take something from us let him let him defraud us and just bring it to the lord you know it's in your hands lord you know you know what god says about that he says vengeance is mine saith the lord and and we just and what our problem is we try to take care of ourselves and god just steps back and says okay all right boy you go handle it but if we give it to god in the right way and have the right the right spirit about the thing and have have our heart in the right place i believe god will turn that into a blessing whatever it may be our life will be blessed he'll bless you in other ways you couldn't even he'll open up windows of blessing for you but we got to have the right spirit we got to have the right heart that's what brother bran would say he would say i'd rather have the right spirit and the wrong doctrine than to have the right doctrine in the right spirit i was talking about aaron here a few moments ago before the service and and you know it's like when you're a pastor it's just like and i've i've been a pastor for 11 years now and it's like you got a target on your back and through the years i've been hurt many times by people and in different ways and i've just taken it and when next time i see them they walk into the church god bless you brother it's good to see you come and welcome you're going to sing a song once you play the guitar wouldn't you do that and i just i just opened the church for them now i realize i can see brother green doing the same thing and i learned from him and you know something there's nothing in my heart against them yeah they they and they've hurt me i've been hurt many times and and and you have a target in your back and that's what it is you're a burden bearer that's what pastors do they they they got to be strong and they need the prayers of the people to keep them up because because they're human pastors are human and it becomes a target and we have to be careful about that because if if our spirit is wrong it's going to lead us down it's going to lead us astray we got to keep our heart right with god you might have your doctrine right on but if you're wrong in your spirit you're never going to be there brother bran said without that perfect love you'll never make it we need that perfect love to be there john saw everything up to the end he saw he saw the the end of the world he saw the seven church changes being played out amen he saw all these things clear into the in into the judgment day and passed into the eighth eternal day god opened up he was he opened up such mysteries to john when he was on that aisle and when he comes back read first john ii john what is he saying little children love one another if you say you love your love god hate your brother truth is not in you you think that is so simple that is so so simple but that's where the great revelation is at when you can attain that and a love and have that patience and that love to love your brothers and your sisters and to respect one another amen then you're then you're you're becoming a spirit a very very spiritual person not because you understand the greek and you understand this and everything brother brown said about the seventh seal and god's gonna bring those things to pass in our life just believe god he'll bring it to pass in your life he brother brandon said take care of the small thing didn't he say that brother take care of the little things in your life and god will take care of the big things you believe that this evening amen so we must examine ourselves through the mirror of god's word there in james 1 22 says but be doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in the glass a mirror if you will for he behold himself and go with his way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was he forgot how he looked forgot the big nose he had amen or that he was bald or or or he had blue hair or green hair or who knows what he forgets how why he looked but who so looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continue with therein he being not a forgetful hero but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed so we must examine ourselves that word is a mirror the word that we that we look at is we should look at it as a mirror to see ourselves do we see ourselves in that word amen how do we see ourselves how do we do that in first corinthians 11 27 jesus was giving the lord's supper to the disciples there in verse 27 of chapter 11 of first corinthians corinthians wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup so what is the lord telling us we examine ourselves if we're going to judge somebody we judge ourselves if i'm going to judge anybody in this room i need to judge me you need to judge yourself he said but let a man examine himself to see if he's worthy when you take the lord's supper you examine yourself lord am i worthy so let him eat of that bread and drink with that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body think about that for this cause many are weak and sickly among you that's why churches fail i believe that's why we fail as christians that's why god doesn't answer our prayers sometimes he says in many sleep i think brother brown said spiritually did for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged talking about that great date of the judgment if we should judge ourselves but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world amen that's what the bible says don't think it's strange when when the trials and tribulations and oh you're trying to fire don't think of strange gods he's chastening you amen there's going to be character come out of that oh but it hurts let me tell you nobody wants to go through that god brings us through anyhow amen second corinthians 13 5 examine yourselves whether you be in the faith judge yourself look at your look into the mirror look into the word that's what the word comes for with the eb of the faith prove your own selves know ye not your own selves too many times we're hearing the word maybe brother aaron's preaching here and maybe he's applying a little pentecostal spanking as you would say and you may be sitting there and and uh brother jordan would say well that's got to be for brother robert are going that that's for him yeah and brother robert charcoal saying oh that's for brother son so amen no no apply it to yourself don't worry about the other the other ones but judge yourself look into the mirror of god's word as the word comes forth no ye not your own cells the preacher don't know you even your own wife don't know you your own husband amen the thoughts are way deep inside of you only you know and god knows is that right those very secret things that we have only that are that we know and god knows he says don't you know yourselves examine yourselves whether you be in the faith prove your own selves don't know ye not your own selves how that jesus christ is in you except you be reprobates my my in recognizing your day in this message in 64 brother bran says what to do what was it to do and this was to bring forth two witnesses moses and elias prophets which the jews only believe their prophets and they'll come forth with a sign of the prophets and their work will be that of the prophet for they did exactly showing one thing that man when you die or whatever when you leave this world your nature doesn't change your if you're a liar now you'll be a liar there if you're hot-headed here you'll be hot-headed there if you're a doubter here you'll be a doubter there men and women it's time to shake ourselves and to examine ourselves know ye not yourself examine ourselves and see where we are standing for death does not change it you think wow when i'm when i die and go to heaven god's gonna take my temper away god's gonna take this away from me oh you're gonna you're gonna remain what you are that's your character brother man said that's the only thing you'll take with you is your character what you are here on earth examine yourself look into the word into the mirror of god's word and say lord let me let me let me line up with your word lord and that's where the word the word the bible says is always this is a sword it's slack into a two-edged sword it cuts coming and going and paul talks about the minister he says you better fear him he'll carry that sword just for anything the minister carried the word of god the swoosh is a sword it's a it's it cuts coming and going and if you get cut you better have enough holy spirit in you to allow that to make you a better christian and now walk out of here all bitter hating the pastor because he said something that maybe cuts you a little bit amen let's be humble let's let us be humble before the lord let the holy spirit begin to move in our hearts that when the word comes and it finds something there god's gonna let you know guys god's gonna bring that minister without him knowing anything to say something that should wake you up look into the mirror of god's word he says death doesn't do nothing to a man but change his dwelling place doesn't change your nature doesn't change your faith doesn't change nothing in you but your dwelling please change is oh god amen to be like jesus to be like jesus on earth i long to be like him in redemption by judgment he says now in 54 says now when he left when he loved adam and eve so that he had to first shed blood before he could the judgment was death now we're talking about judgment and judging and he had something had to die in their stead and when they could stand then in his presence now in there was judgment he first listened to satan and he whitewashed the word over and they disbelieved the word and the word then became god's judgment now this word the word of god will judge every person this word that's being preached here he says this morning i'll say this evening is being preached down there at wall street preached over there in the christian church down at the presbyterian church wherever the word is being preached it becomes the judgment men are judged by the word of god and there's one good thing to know that we either our judgment goes before us or it will follow after us oh my that's scary either the judgment goes before you or it'll follow after you and we'll stand there in that day you know there'll be no mercy it's going to be judgment i hear the prophet of god say i'll tell you again lord i don't want your judgment lord i want your mercy amen first peter 4 17 almost a closing this evening first peter 4 17 for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if it first began at us what shall be the end of them that obey not the gospel of god and he goes on and says that the righteous scarcely well there what does that mean just make it by the skin of our teeth brother brad said we hang by a string or something like that over the flames of hell but it's a mercy of god that holds us if the righteous scarcely be saved where will the ungodly and the sinner appear if we're being judged tonight and you take that word don't look at the man take your eyes off the flesh because we all fail we we are frail we're weak i'm talking about us ministers don't look at the man don't look at the flesh look at the word that's coming there's something about the word for the word of god is quick it's alive powerful sharper than any twitch sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart something about that word of god don't look at the man say lord take brother aaron or where it might be standing behind this pulpit lord speak to my heart if you come hungry god's going to feel you you come expecting god's going to do something in your life it's what you there's a sermon one day i want to bring one day it's about investments it's what you invest i asked the church one day what did you invest this morning how many of you how many of you fasted yesterday how many were in prayer last night how many got up early this morning with the sun and before the sun came up and got on your knees before god praying because you were going to come to church and the king of kings was going to come and meet with you where was your expectation where what was your investment what did you invest you come in you go out you're going to go out either a better christian or you're going to believe worse it depends on what what price you're willing to pay in your own life amen regardless who stands behind this pulpit god if god can make a make a mule or an ass to speak to a prophet he can surely use a man of god who's laying in the presence of god studying the word the bible says study to the ministers to show thy sword thyself uh uh how's it goal brother study to show thyself approved of god a workman that needeth not to be ashamed there's something about i'm not talking about a button pusher i'm talking about a man of god that stands he's studying the word he's in the word of god he the bible says that the elders those are pastors are worthy of double honor especially they that labor in the word and doctrine you see there's something about a man that brother bran says he should be laying in the presence of jehovah of god before he steps behind the pulpit and but if you if you're not preparing yourself what good will it do we all have to play a part in this we all have an investment to make amen if the musicians will come tonight so if we're to judge anyone judge anyone harshly it's ourselves in awakening jesus in 63 make me more like you he says always judge not after emotion brother brown says judge after the word it's got to be the word now watch the word and what the word says then no that's right because god said that that makes it right the word of god when we stand here we bring up bring the word whatever god has placed in our hand in our hearts many times i have my notes but god will take me in different directions i know both aaron attends to this as well and we don't know but he's dealing with hearts of people that have needs and if you come with the right attitude and don't look at the man don't look at the flesh there's a it's a veil that was our problem back there with jesus all they could see was the flesh but god was veiled think of it god was veiled behind flesh and this evening and behind this pulpit is god again veiled behind flesh when you see one another it's god veil behind flesh amen what respect we ought to have one for another loving one another respecting one another highly don't let a word come out of your mouth against anyone you know that's a that's whenever if i speak say something like that about somebody immediately i feel i feel myself like like god has just drawn away from me you feel that way you ever get around someone all they want to do is talk about everybody you know what it does it drains you you walk out of there feeling drained and you don't even know why it's a spirit friends be careful of that keep your heart clean before god don't judge don't condemn anybody don't ever let words come out of your mouth to put somebody down [Music] instead get on your knees and say lord help that one let it be your mercy and grace i know he's going she's going through things lord we want to be like jesus i want to have that spirit what kind of spirit did he have [Music] you know he said you have heard that it had been said thou shalt love thy neighbor hate this enemy but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hates you and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you that's the spirit of god you'll stand with me tonight you want to be like jesus you want to be like jesus pray for them to despitefully use you and persecute you that you might be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust amen [Music] let his love be shed upon us receive that love tonight say lord god i'm found one to you anybody feel they were found wanting tonight i've i'm found one i know that i've done things i've said things we've all have but there's a time we can say lord please forgive me [Music] don't let me lord speak like that no more let your holy spirit come in me in such a manner fill me with your goodness lord your patience your love your temperance lord you know what temperance is control control control my spirit lord control my thoughts control my passions control who i am lord by the holy ghost hallelujah make me more like these jesus make people like thee oh give me a heart that's filled with love and lay make [Music] father you promised lord that you would send your spirit lord so that we could be like you lord lord this evening make us channels father i hear the prophet of god say that open up your channels let the holy spirit begin to move through you have his way in our life lord let the rivers lord of love and joy and peace long-suffering gentleness goodness oh god meekness temperance faith flow through us lord once those fruits begin to flow through us god hallelujah you said by their fruits they shall be known hallelujah bless your people tonight lord as we surrender to you lord god not just tonight but tomorrow the next day begin to make our investments lord begin to read our bibles again go back to praying in the morning before we leave the house and go back to to to loving and to trying to do good for somebody a good deed somewhere lord living for others brother bran says we're looking to heaven in the face help us lord god to do the deeds of the holy spirit wear your your hands with your feet here on earth lord use us father as we surrender to you in the name of the lord jesus christ oh make me more like these [Music] give me a heart that's filled with love if it's filled with love there's not room for anything else because it's filled already it's full [Music] as brother robert was ministering there and i remember something from brother green's testimony when him and brother branham were coming back they got up to the flagstaff there i-40 and brother brim had been telling brother green some things about some of the brothers what they had been doing and brother brown tells brother again well he says if we had some time we'd go over and visit minister for them brother green looks at him and he says what he says you just finished telling me everything they've done wrong and he said he says brother green he says i'm bloodbathing towns he goes i'm embarrassed by you that you know why you would think that way he goes just because they're that they're not that doesn't make them not my brothers i'd go do that if he came to save us when we were perfect we wouldn't need to save it but he came because we needed him [Music] i was in the office one day with brother green and a brother came in and i knew the brother and he asked brother green for some things and i knew how this brother acted and brother green gave him to him to all so after he left i told brother green i said this man told you a story he's not going to do because this is how he does and he goes brother aaron i'm commanded to give so i did what god asked me to do now let god take care of the other part maybe some of you i don't know a long time ago sitting here brother brother green was preaching and my brother kept shouting amen in the middle of the preaching brother green stops and he calls the brother out he said you're saying amen to the word but you haven't kept your word and they got into a verbal tassel here and he asked the deacons to take the brother out and the brother was saying things so brother green asked the congregation to leave he i don't want the congregation to get that spirit [Music] and then about six months to a year the brother comes back and brother green calls him up to pray [Music] so i went to brother greene after and i said i don't understand why you did that don't you remember what happened he goes that's how you keep hatred out of your heart for brothers treat him right the second what a lesson to learn change my heart oh god make it ever true change my heart [Music] true [Music] may i be like change my heart oh god change my heart oh god [Music] may i be like i am [Music] that is [Music] changed [Music] he talks about this he said you know when you confess it and you make it right with god he puts it through the blood and there's no evidence of it anymore and you bring it up and you say lord i've done it again he said you've done what no this is the first time he looks at the book and it's not there when we forgive one another let it be the end of that each one of us and i say that for myself it doesn't we don't have to bring it up over and over it's been forgiven it's been glad let's go on there's a joy and a peace knowing that god has forgiven you there's a victory in your life let's share that with one another amen [Music] god is so good to us he's mindful of us that he cares it's talking to a brother one day and i just brought some of these things to mind and he was unhappy about some of the other churches and he was telling me all that they were doing wrong [Music] i just asked him this question i said brother what if you get to heaven when you get to heaven they're there what are you going to do what are you going to say are you going to say god if they're there i don't want to be here there's only one other place to go he looked at me because i never thought of it that way i said that's the truth the grace that it takes for me to be there the same grace is to take for all of us today your word has come because you knew when you put it in my heart to call brother robert to see if he would minister for us tonight i didn't ask have brother robert preach this lord i just said if brother roberts
