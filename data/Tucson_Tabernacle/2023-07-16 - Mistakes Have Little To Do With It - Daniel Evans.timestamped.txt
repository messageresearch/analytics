[43:43] Brother Dan Brother Nathan there
[43:45] brother Joe Miller was there also thanks
[43:49] thanks to the the brethren for coming
[43:52] we had a we had a nice service
[43:54] before before service
[43:57] um
[43:58] Steph and I were in the hotel room and
[44:00] we prayed
[44:03] and then uh went to service on on Friday
[44:06] night and I spoke on something similar
[44:09] to what I'll be speaking on this morning
[44:12] um
[44:14] and then
[44:16] after service
[44:18] yesterday
[44:20] we were coming home we had another
[44:22] service yesterday and then we were
[44:24] coming home and stalking with my wife
[44:28] and we were just talking about the Lord
[44:30] and talking about the people and talking
[44:31] about the work that sets in front of us
[44:34] and and Stephanie told me she said you
[44:36] know she said what you prayed
[44:38] when she prayed before service
[44:41] she said You Prayed you said
[44:43] Lord
[44:45] help me
[44:47] to say something that'll help the people
[44:52] and she said you know she said you
[44:55] you could have prayed Lord help me to
[44:58] have a good sermon
[44:59] Lord you could you could have Stephanie
[45:02] said you could have prayed Lord let me
[45:05] draw an emotion out of the people
[45:07] you could have prayed Lord may I tie
[45:10] everything together well and may it may
[45:13] it provoke a response and Inspire the
[45:16] people but but you know you prayed Lord
[45:19] may I say something to help the people
[45:23] and I believe that is our role amen it's
[45:27] not
[45:28] to bring an eloquent sermon it's not
[45:31] it's not to be able to tie all the
[45:33] scriptures in together and and make it
[45:36] to where it makes sense and and to bring
[45:38] some new revelation it it may be that
[45:41] but it's all to help the people
[45:45] or else why would we even be here
[45:48] if it's not to help
[45:50] that's it's the desire of My Heart Lord
[45:54] just to help in any way that I can
[45:59] we've been going through the book of
[46:00] Acts
[46:01] during the week and and I I think that
[46:04] I'm I've been the Most Blessed of
[46:06] everybody to be able to go through this
[46:09] book and and I think the thing that has
[46:11] meant the most to me
[46:14] starting with chapter one and going all
[46:17] the way through half of chapter 19.
[46:20] the thing that has meant the most to me
[46:23] is that these were normal human beings
[46:27] in the book of Acts we we talk about we
[46:30] quote Peter and we quote Paul and and
[46:32] and and we we all the Miracles that have
[46:36] that have happened but these were normal
[46:38] people
[46:40] they were like us
[46:42] they had faults
[46:44] they had problems and then we see the
[46:47] enemy coming in
[46:49] and trying to divide the people
[46:53] in this book of Acts and here we see it
[46:56] so plainly today in our world
[47:00] it's there
[47:02] the enemy he's always trying to separate
[47:04] he's trying to separate this church from
[47:06] that church this church teaches this
[47:09] Doctrine and that church teaches this
[47:12] Doctrine and this Baptist Church just
[47:13] teaches that the Assembly of God teaches
[47:15] this the Pentecostal Church teaches this
[47:17] or this little independent church down
[47:19] the road teaches that
[47:21] separates separates separate
[47:25] there are scriptures
[47:28] in quotes about separating
[47:32] but most of them are the opposite most
[47:36] of them teach Unity
[47:38] among the people and unity among the
[47:41] among the the body of Christ
[47:45] and
[47:46] I see that so often that that we
[47:51] as we're coming to church and as we go
[47:53] to work or our normal days we see so
[47:58] many mistakes and we have such little
[48:01] patience for people that make mistakes
[48:04] and it's it's not right it's not what
[48:07] this book teaches
[48:10] we see that
[48:11] people
[48:13] they have problems all of us do
[48:16] and all of us fail
[48:20] and we should have more patience with
[48:22] each other
[48:23] in our failures and in the problems that
[48:25] we have
[48:28] think about Moses
[48:31] and how Moses said
[48:34] come on come on the scene at about 40
[48:36] years old made a big mistake Moses got
[48:41] it in his mind that he was going he knew
[48:43] that he was supposed to deliver the
[48:45] people in some way
[48:46] so he got it in his mind he said what
[48:49] I'll do is I will kill this Egyptian
[48:52] here and then there will be a big
[48:54] Uprising among the people and we will
[48:57] militarily will take over this land
[49:01] of Egypt that are our slave masters
[49:05] Moses had it in his head
[49:09] he carried out
[49:11] killed this this man that was
[49:13] persecuting one of his people
[49:16] and it didn't work
[49:18] it failed miserably
[49:21] it was a mistake
[49:23] Moses was exiled out and even his own
[49:27] people said will you kill us Kill Me
[49:30] Like You Killed the Egyptian the other
[49:31] day
[49:33] Moses must have thought
[49:35] how did how did this happen it was a
[49:37] mistake
[49:39] so then he leave for 40 years he comes
[49:42] back and now he's the deliverer he takes
[49:45] the people out God sends ten plagues
[49:49] upon Egypt
[49:51] to our Pharaoh is just like get out of
[49:54] here you're you're this is destroying my
[49:57] country they go out
[49:59] God hardens his heart again he sends the
[50:02] Army out they get backed up against the
[50:04] Red Sea
[50:06] God sends an East Wind walls up the
[50:09] water on both sides and here comes
[50:11] millions of Hebrews walking across this
[50:15] ocean on dry land with the walls of
[50:18] water on either side to the to the other
[50:21] side and then here comes the task
[50:23] Masters in the army of Egypt and God
[50:26] brings down the water upon the entire
[50:29] Army
[50:30] I don't know of a greater miracle in
[50:32] this book than that
[50:34] so then they go over this great miracle
[50:36] and immediately they start complaining
[50:39] we're hungry
[50:41] Moses must have been frustrated
[50:45] we're hungry so so then God Rains Down
[50:48] manna
[50:50] down from heaven every day
[50:52] they didn't have water
[50:55] Moses goes up to this Cliff this cleft
[50:58] of this rock and he smacks it with his
[51:01] Rod water comes out
[51:03] gives water to all all of the people and
[51:06] all their livestock millions of people
[51:08] Miracle after miracle happened
[51:12] and then
[51:14] as they traveled they got thirsty again
[51:18] and they started complaining
[51:22] Numbers Chapter 20.
[51:24] verse 1. it says this
[51:29] then came the children of Israel
[51:33] even the whole congregation into the
[51:35] desert of Zen in the first month
[51:38] and the people Abode in kadish
[51:40] and Miriam died there and was buried
[51:43] there Miriam is Moses's sister
[51:46] and there was no water for the
[51:48] congregation
[51:49] and they gathered themselves together
[51:51] against Moses and against Aaron
[51:54] and the people chode with Moses
[51:56] and spake saying would God that we had
[51:59] died when our Brethren died before the
[52:01] Lord
[52:02] and why have ye brought up the
[52:04] congregation of the Lord Into the
[52:06] Wilderness that we and our cattle should
[52:08] die there
[52:10] and wherefore have ye made us to come up
[52:13] out of Egypt to bring us unto this evil
[52:16] place it is no place of seed or of figs
[52:20] or vines or pomegranates neither is
[52:23] there any water to drink
[52:26] and Moses and Aaron went from the
[52:29] presence of the assembly
[52:31] unto the door of the Tabernacle of the
[52:33] congregation and they fell upon their
[52:35] faces and the glory of the Lord appeared
[52:38] unto them
[52:41] and the Lord spake unto Moses saying
[52:44] listen closely
[52:47] take the rod
[52:50] and gather thou the assembly together
[52:52] thou and Aaron thy brother
[52:54] and speak
[52:56] ye unto the rock Before Their Eyes
[53:00] remember the last time he took his rod
[53:03] and he
[53:05] smacked it he hit it and then the water
[53:08] came forth this time God says speak to
[53:11] the Rock
[53:13] you know it shall give forth his water
[53:14] and thou shalt bring forth to them water
[53:17] out of the rock so Thou shalt give the
[53:20] congregation and their BEAST's drink
[53:25] and Moses took the rod from before the
[53:27] Lord
[53:28] as he had commanded him
[53:30] and Moses and Aaron gathered the
[53:32] congregation there before the Rock and
[53:35] he said unto them
[53:36] here now ye Rebels much must we fetch
[53:41] you water out of this rock
[53:44] Moses there's a lot of pressure on him
[53:48] his sister just died
[53:50] they all the people were complaining and
[53:53] all of this was
[53:54] all of these Miracles that had happened
[53:57] and Moses was upset number one because
[54:00] if you look at it they were questioning
[54:02] Moses's Authority
[54:06] and they were complaining against Moses
[54:10] and Moses
[54:13] was angry about it Moses saw what they
[54:16] were doing and Moses was coming in and
[54:18] he brought correction
[54:23] to these people
[54:26] again
[54:27] saying do we need to fetch you water out
[54:29] of this rock
[54:33] I think Moses
[54:35] right there
[54:37] he got out of the will of the Lord
[54:41] I think of so many times a minister
[54:43] might come to the pulpit and he has it
[54:46] in his mind
[54:48] something that he's going to say to the
[54:50] people because maybe he sees the people
[54:52] straying maybe he sees he sees some
[54:54] problems arise in the church
[54:56] and he comes and he says I'm going to
[54:58] lay the ax to the root of the tree I'm
[55:00] going to hit them with everything that
[55:02] that I've got
[55:04] and I look at myself
[55:06] and if you know me very well
[55:10] um
[55:11] ask my wife if you don't believe me but
[55:14] a lot of times
[55:16] I'm quick
[55:19] to to pull the sword
[55:23] sometimes sometimes I'm quick to jump
[55:26] out and get you
[55:28] and and I try and I I Repent many times
[55:32] but it's my personality it's the way
[55:34] that I am it's something that I have to
[55:36] overcome
[55:38] and there's been many times that I've
[55:39] come to this Pulpit over the past seven
[55:41] months and I've had my Bible and my
[55:44] scriptures here and I've been ready to
[55:46] say you're and then the Lord says you're
[55:48] going to do it
[55:50] and here's my notes
[55:52] here's my scripture open
[55:57] and then the thoughts
[56:02] yeah
[56:04] and then something says it's you it's
[56:06] not me
[56:08] and the same thing right here was Moses
[56:12] and he goes up and he rips them and that
[56:16] was not God God didn't tell him to do
[56:17] that
[56:19] he tells them to do it at other times
[56:20] but in this this spot right here he
[56:23] didn't say it
[56:25] and what happened was Moses got himself
[56:28] and number one they were questioning him
[56:30] he got a little personal there
[56:32] Moses comes up and he just rips them
[56:37] and it wasn't God
[56:40] it was a mistake
[56:46] from the sermon
[56:47] The Works that I do bear witness of me
[56:51] listen to this
[56:54] now notice
[56:59] Now 51
[57:01] 0413.
[57:05] now notice
[57:07] now Moses smote The Rock
[57:11] the second time representing that Christ
[57:14] should come to the Earth and to Earth
[57:16] and die again now he had power to bring
[57:18] forth water out of the Rock
[57:20] whether it was God's will or not
[57:24] did you know that
[57:26] everybody will admit that it wasn't
[57:29] God's will but Moses done it anyhow
[57:33] he had power God entrusted him to be a
[57:37] prophet he gave him those powers to do
[57:40] that and he found out that his servant
[57:43] failed him
[57:45] and he glorified himself
[57:48] instead of God
[57:51] and then what happened
[57:52] God dealt with Moses then didn't he not
[57:56] with the children with Moses
[57:59] the holy spirit is given to a man and
[58:02] gifts are given to a man but you have to
[58:04] watch what you're doing with those
[58:07] Divine gifts
[58:09] scripture comes to mind that gifts and
[58:12] callings are without repentance
[58:16] so God gives us those gifts how we use
[58:19] those gifts is up to us
[58:22] if you're a gifted singer like brother
[58:25] Matthew
[58:27] brother Matthew could use that gift to
[58:31] serve Satan
[58:32] brother Matthew could use that gift to
[58:35] deceive people brother Matthew could use
[58:38] that gift for the world and God won't
[58:41] take it away
[58:44] repentance is is just a turn back it's
[58:46] it's to bring it back
[58:49] and he doesn't do it he gives you a gift
[58:51] all of us have gifts he gives that to
[58:54] you and says here
[58:56] what are you going to do with it and
[58:58] that's exactly what happened here at the
[59:01] rock with Moses
[59:06] now that quote that I just read
[59:09] has to do with this next verse
[59:12] and Moses lifted up his hand
[59:15] and with his rod
[59:17] he smote The Rock twice
[59:21] and the water came out abundantly
[59:24] and the congregation drank
[59:26] and their beasts also
[59:29] now remember God told him to speak to
[59:32] the Rock he got himself worked up he got
[59:34] it in his mind here's how I'm going to
[59:36] do it I'm gonna I'm gonna tell them how
[59:37] it is and they're they're sinning
[59:39] against God and they're they're
[59:40] questioning me and Moses goes out there
[59:43] and he he rips the people he takes his
[59:46] staff he hits the rock nothing comes out
[59:48] he smacks it again out comes the water
[59:52] and water flows through
[59:54] millions of people drank
[59:58] from the rock that day and not only them
[1:00:00] but their livestock also
[1:00:02] drank
[1:00:04] a brother asked me
[1:00:06] a few days ago
[1:00:07] I was talking with him he's a
[1:00:10] um a deacon in a church in New Mexico he
[1:00:13] uh he asked me he says why did God honor
[1:00:18] Moses when he's when he struck that rock
[1:00:21] twice why did God honor that knowing
[1:00:25] that God that Moses was out of the will
[1:00:28] of God
[1:00:30] that's a good question
[1:00:31] think about it why would God honor that
[1:00:35] God honored it because his people were
[1:00:39] dying of thirst
[1:00:41] it was God's will that they would drink
[1:00:46] he didn't want him to die
[1:00:48] he wanted them to drink and that's why
[1:00:51] he sent Moses to to speak to this rock
[1:00:55] to bring the water out but God also had
[1:00:58] a long-term plan and Moses messed it up
[1:01:02] that long-term plan was that that rock
[1:01:05] was supposed to be smitten one time
[1:01:08] because that rock represented Jesus
[1:01:11] Christ
[1:01:13] he should die once for the sin of the
[1:01:16] people he should be smitten once for the
[1:01:19] sin of the people and Moses in his own
[1:01:21] thinking in his own anger he got he
[1:01:25] messed it up
[1:01:27] the whole symbolic the whole symbolism
[1:01:29] of the whole Rock in the wilderness
[1:01:35] it was a mistake
[1:01:37] by the prophet
[1:01:39] it's my job as a minister not to give
[1:01:41] you a history lesson but to bring that
[1:01:44] to this day
[1:01:46] so think about this
[1:01:48] Moses smote the rock water came forth
[1:01:52] God still blessed Moses's mistake
[1:01:56] we
[1:01:57] still drank
[1:01:59] so do you think
[1:02:02] Joshua and Caleb
[1:02:04] I don't know if they knew it Aaron Aaron
[1:02:06] knew it
[1:02:08] do you think do you think Aaron maybe
[1:02:10] said
[1:02:11] Moses
[1:02:13] you should have spoke to the Rock
[1:02:15] and not hit it with your Rod twice I'm
[1:02:19] not drinking
[1:02:23] he'd have died
[1:02:24] he'd have died of thirst
[1:02:27] it was God blessing the people God
[1:02:30] wanted his people to drink
[1:02:33] so he used his servant even in his error
[1:02:36] even in his mistake God still used his
[1:02:40] servant to bring forth water
[1:02:44] and the Lord spake unto Moses
[1:02:48] and unto Aaron
[1:02:50] because ye believed me not verse number
[1:02:54] 12.
[1:02:55] because ye believed me not to sanctify
[1:02:58] me in the eyes of the children
[1:03:02] let me read that again
[1:03:05] because you believed me not
[1:03:08] to sanctify me me meaning God
[1:03:14] in the eyes of the children
[1:03:17] of Israel
[1:03:19] it's not about you Moses
[1:03:21] it's about me
[1:03:23] it's about the Jehovah God the one that
[1:03:26] actually brings these miracles
[1:03:29] you may be a prophet you may be a
[1:03:31] servant you may be an angel but let me
[1:03:32] tell you it's God that does it
[1:03:35] God is bringing these
[1:03:40] to sanctify me
[1:03:42] in the eyes of of Israel therefore you
[1:03:45] shall not bring this congregation into
[1:03:48] the land which I have given them
[1:03:51] he's talking about the Promised Land
[1:03:55] he's talking about that land over Jordan
[1:03:57] that he had promised to Abraham
[1:04:01] that he had reiterated to Joseph and on
[1:04:05] and here is the deliverer and he says oh
[1:04:08] you're not gonna go because you made
[1:04:11] this mistake you messed up my whole plan
[1:04:15] so Moses it's not about you
[1:04:18] you're not going but I'm going to bring
[1:04:19] him across
[1:04:24] but Moses
[1:04:27] the great man that he was how many of us
[1:04:30] would have thought about ourselves
[1:04:33] and said I'm done with it
[1:04:34] I'm finished if I'm not going to go over
[1:04:37] if I'm not going to get this promised
[1:04:39] land that God has promised I'm the
[1:04:41] deliverer I've worked so hard for this
[1:04:43] church I've done I've I've changed all
[1:04:46] this and I've worked my fingers to the
[1:04:48] Bone helping everything if I don't get
[1:04:50] to go I'm finished why do I even need it
[1:04:54] it's not about you Moses
[1:04:56] and Moses knew it wasn't about him he
[1:04:59] made a mistake and Moses knew it
[1:05:02] Moses kept working
[1:05:04] kept trying kept doing everything that
[1:05:07] he could
[1:05:09] and that rock that Moses smote
[1:05:14] don't forget the water still came forth
[1:05:17] and the the Lord blessed the people even
[1:05:21] in his mistakes
[1:05:23] water came from that rock
[1:05:29] think about other mistakes that have
[1:05:32] made that was a big one
[1:05:34] and what I want to do and I'm just
[1:05:35] telling you what I'm where I'm going in
[1:05:37] this I want us to think about our
[1:05:39] mistakes and all that we've done
[1:05:41] and it's okay
[1:05:44] there's some Whoppers that were made in
[1:05:46] the Bible by the greatest men that have
[1:05:49] ever lived
[1:05:50] this man Joseph when he was young
[1:05:55] his Brethren got jealous of him
[1:05:59] so they they go and he's Joseph's doing
[1:06:02] he's a young man and he's he's filled
[1:06:04] with the spirit and and he has these
[1:06:06] gifts and they get jealous because they
[1:06:07] don't have those those gifts and they're
[1:06:09] sick and tired of this kid telling them
[1:06:12] how to do things and then Joseph has
[1:06:15] this dream where he's exalted over them
[1:06:17] and they're like that's enough
[1:06:20] we are sick of this guy
[1:06:22] so they take him
[1:06:24] out
[1:06:25] away
[1:06:27] they take him
[1:06:28] they throw him in this pit as well
[1:06:33] we're finished with this guy
[1:06:35] done with them
[1:06:36] they take it they take his coat that his
[1:06:39] dad had given him and they put some
[1:06:40] blood on it from a goat they bring it
[1:06:43] back to his dad said he's dead he's
[1:06:44] lying got him here and it broke his
[1:06:47] dad's heart here he is in this pit his
[1:06:49] some of his brothers felt bad they ended
[1:06:51] up selling him into slavery he goes off
[1:06:54] a horrible mistake
[1:06:57] Joseph goes off
[1:07:00] for years he's gone
[1:07:03] God starts blessing this man he's in
[1:07:06] prison He blesses him in prison he's
[1:07:08] outside of prison He blesses him outside
[1:07:10] of prison then he exalts this man Joseph
[1:07:13] so high to he's the second ruler in the
[1:07:16] greatest country on Earth at that time
[1:07:18] Egypt
[1:07:20] Joseph was the man
[1:07:23] and then
[1:07:25] he has a he has a vision and and he's
[1:07:28] storing up food and they run out of food
[1:07:31] where these same ones that that threw
[1:07:34] him in the well and tried to kill him
[1:07:36] those same ones were their dad says hey
[1:07:38] go there's there's grain in Egypt go
[1:07:40] there they go there they come before
[1:07:43] Joseph they didn't recognize him he
[1:07:45] wasn't even speaking their language they
[1:07:46] didn't recognize him
[1:07:50] Joseph he knows exactly who they were
[1:07:53] Genesis chapter 45 let's read it
[1:08:09] verse 1.
[1:08:11] then Joseph could not refrain himself
[1:08:14] from all them that stood by him remember
[1:08:17] they didn't recognize who he was these
[1:08:20] are his brothers
[1:08:22] and he cried
[1:08:24] because there caused every and he cried
[1:08:26] he said this caused every man to go out
[1:08:29] from me and there stood no man with him
[1:08:31] while Joseph made himself known to his
[1:08:34] brethren
[1:08:35] these are the people that tried to kill
[1:08:37] him his own Brothers
[1:08:39] and he wept aloud
[1:08:42] and the Egyptians and the house of the
[1:08:44] Pharaoh heard and Joseph said unto his
[1:08:47] Brethren I am Joseph
[1:08:52] I bet you that was a scary moment
[1:08:55] for these for these brothers
[1:08:59] I am Joseph
[1:09:01] doth my father yet live
[1:09:05] and his Brethren could not answer him
[1:09:07] for they were troubled at his presence I
[1:09:09] bet they were
[1:09:13] they were probably thinking well how
[1:09:15] long is my heart going to continue to
[1:09:16] beat
[1:09:18] because this man might cause it to stop
[1:09:21] and Joseph said unto his Brethren come
[1:09:23] near to me
[1:09:24] I pray you and they came near and he
[1:09:28] said I am Joseph your brother
[1:09:29] whom you sold into Egypt
[1:09:32] now listen to this
[1:09:34] this great mistake that these men had
[1:09:37] made
[1:09:37] now therefore be not grieved nor angry
[1:09:40] with yourselves wow
[1:09:45] be not grieved nor angry with yourselves
[1:09:46] that you sold me hither
[1:09:48] for God did send me before you to
[1:09:51] preserve life
[1:09:59] sorry there's a smudge in my
[1:10:03] God to preserve life
[1:10:07] for these two years
[1:10:09] hath the famine been in the land
[1:10:12] and yet there are five years in the
[1:10:15] which there should there shall neither
[1:10:16] be earring nor Harvest and God sent me
[1:10:19] before you to preserve you at posterity
[1:10:23] in the earth and to save your lives by a
[1:10:27] great Deliverance
[1:10:29] so now it was not you that sent me
[1:10:33] hither
[1:10:34] but God
[1:10:35] in this mistake in this bad attitude
[1:10:38] that they had in this hatred that they
[1:10:40] had for their brother wanting to kill
[1:10:42] him Joseph says hey it wasn't you
[1:10:45] wow
[1:10:46] how many of our mistakes
[1:10:49] how many times have we felt so bad
[1:10:53] and it wasn't nearly as bad as what
[1:10:55] these guys did
[1:10:57] Joseph says it wasn't you but it was God
[1:11:01] and he hath made me a father to pharaoh
[1:11:03] and Lord of all his house in a ruler
[1:11:06] throughout all the land of Egypt
[1:11:09] these 12 these 11 other besides Benjamin
[1:11:14] say 10 others
[1:11:16] these became the Patriarchs
[1:11:21] of the Jewish race
[1:11:24] these were the fathers of all the Jews
[1:11:27] so much so that they were each one of
[1:11:29] them was so important that their lineage
[1:11:31] is recorded all the way down all the way
[1:11:34] down to to to David later
[1:11:38] all the way down to Jesus
[1:11:41] Lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:11:43] down to the man that we've been talking
[1:11:45] about in the book of Acts down to Paul
[1:11:47] from Benjamin
[1:11:49] that's how important that these men were
[1:11:53] and yet they made a mistake
[1:11:56] caused all these problems but yet God
[1:11:59] was in it
[1:12:02] I think about Paul I just mentioned Paul
[1:12:05] how many Christians now we go into the
[1:12:08] New Testament in the book of Acts how
[1:12:10] many Christians did this man Saul of
[1:12:12] Tarsus who became Paul
[1:12:15] how many Christians did he imprison
[1:12:19] how many Christians
[1:12:21] came to their end because of this man's
[1:12:25] Saul of Tarsus this evil man
[1:12:27] that was bent on destroying this
[1:12:31] Christian faith
[1:12:32] he stood there one of the one of the
[1:12:34] greatest people in the whole new church
[1:12:39] of Christianity was this man named
[1:12:42] Stephen a deacon and he came and he was
[1:12:44] preaching the gospel and Healing The
[1:12:46] Sick and doing all of these Miracles
[1:12:48] such a good man and here comes this mob
[1:12:51] just because he was preaching things
[1:12:54] that didn't line up with their Doctrine
[1:12:56] Here Comes This mob
[1:12:58] of Jews
[1:13:02] throws them out throw them outside the
[1:13:04] city and take up stones and start
[1:13:06] hitting that man with these Stones
[1:13:08] beating him
[1:13:10] in his head
[1:13:13] destroying him killing him
[1:13:16] and here is this young man Saul of
[1:13:19] Tarsus
[1:13:20] do it
[1:13:21] kill him
[1:13:23] how bad of a mistake from this man
[1:13:26] and Paul writes that must have really
[1:13:28] bothered him through the years it must
[1:13:31] have really bothered him how that he
[1:13:33] would consented to the deaths and
[1:13:35] imprisonment
[1:13:38] of men and women and probably children
[1:13:40] too because they were Christians
[1:13:43] what an evil man what an awful thing to
[1:13:46] do
[1:13:48] and he writes later on
[1:13:51] he writes to his Protege a man named
[1:13:53] Timothy
[1:13:54] Frank Christ Jesus our lord who hath
[1:13:58] enabled me for that he counted me
[1:14:00] faithful putting me into the ministry
[1:14:03] who was before a blasphemer
[1:14:07] and a persecutor
[1:14:10] and injurious
[1:14:11] but I obtained Mercy because I did it
[1:14:14] ignorantly in unbelief and the grace of
[1:14:17] our Lord was exceeding abundant with
[1:14:19] faith and love which is in Christ Jesus
[1:14:22] this is a faithful saying and worthy of
[1:14:25] all acceptation that Christ Jesus came
[1:14:28] into the world to save sinners of whom I
[1:14:32] am chief
[1:14:34] so now you know why Paul could say that
[1:14:36] because of what he had done the mistakes
[1:14:39] that he made
[1:14:42] how be it
[1:14:44] for this cause I obtain Mercy
[1:14:47] that in me first Jesus Christ might show
[1:14:51] forth all long-suffering for a pattern
[1:14:55] to them which should Hereafter believe
[1:14:58] on him to life Everlasting
[1:15:01] so though I make my mistakes
[1:15:04] though I have done this and everybody
[1:15:06] knew who he was when he was writing this
[1:15:08] letter
[1:15:09] so even though I made mistakes and I've
[1:15:11] done this and I have sinned so much I am
[1:15:13] the chiefest of all the Sinners they
[1:15:15] probably said yeah he actually is
[1:15:17] yeah Paul Paul speaking the truth even
[1:15:20] even when he's condemning himself
[1:15:21] actually he is the chiefess of Sinners
[1:15:23] because he's done all of this
[1:15:25] but Paul says it's Jesus is showing a
[1:15:28] pattern
[1:15:30] for those who will believe on him no
[1:15:32] matter what you have done no matter what
[1:15:34] you mistake you have made the blood of
[1:15:37] Jesus Christ covers those mistakes
[1:15:40] and if he can save Paul
[1:15:42] this man that did all of these things is
[1:15:45] he not able
[1:15:47] to correct my mistakes
[1:15:50] and we worry so much about the mistakes
[1:15:53] that we have made
[1:15:55] Peter
[1:15:58] and along the same lines as Paul
[1:16:01] Peter was with Jesus
[1:16:04] for three and a half years
[1:16:07] was with him saw all the things that he
[1:16:09] did saw his personality knew him
[1:16:12] loved him
[1:16:15] And yet when it came right down to it
[1:16:19] this man Peter
[1:16:22] denied that he even knew Jesus Christ
[1:16:27] he said I don't know that guy he was
[1:16:29] afraid
[1:16:31] what a mistake
[1:16:34] Jesus said
[1:16:36] this must have been ringing in Peter's
[1:16:38] ears Jesus said he that denies me before
[1:16:41] men
[1:16:43] I will deny him before my father
[1:16:46] Jesus and Peter denied him three times
[1:16:48] in the same night
[1:16:51] Jesus prophesied he said before the
[1:16:54] crows before the rooster crows he said
[1:16:57] you'll deny me three times Peter said
[1:17:00] not me
[1:17:02] and then a few hours later I don't even
[1:17:04] know him I don't even know him and then
[1:17:05] the last time he started cussing
[1:17:08] he started swearing just so that they
[1:17:12] would see that this man is not
[1:17:13] associated with Christ
[1:17:16] so sometimes when we let those bad words
[1:17:19] come about out of our mouths
[1:17:22] that's what Peter did to say I'm not
[1:17:24] associated with Jesus
[1:17:26] so be careful
[1:17:30] and yet
[1:17:31] this Peter and all the bad things that
[1:17:35] he did this Peter Jesus said I give you
[1:17:38] the Keys of the Kingdom
[1:17:41] so much so that he was so filled with
[1:17:44] the holy spirit that that man at the
[1:17:46] gate called Beautiful he was asking for
[1:17:49] money there in the book of Acts and
[1:17:50] Peter and John came they didn't have any
[1:17:52] money Peter said hey
[1:17:55] I don't have any silver or gold I don't
[1:17:57] have anything to give you but what I
[1:17:58] have I give to you and what was better a
[1:18:01] bunch of money or was it better what he
[1:18:04] gave them he said this man of the gay
[1:18:06] called Beautiful had been
[1:18:07] crippled since his birth
[1:18:10] Peter said what I have I give to you
[1:18:14] rise up and walk in the spirit of the
[1:18:16] Lord came down and Rose that man up and
[1:18:19] he jumped up and down and he went and he
[1:18:22] was healed from that moment on the man
[1:18:25] that denied Jesus Christ three times in
[1:18:28] one night was embarrassed
[1:18:31] and how much more have we and how much
[1:18:32] less have we done and yet we let our
[1:18:34] mistakes bother us so much
[1:18:42] I want to I want to say something
[1:18:45] about
[1:18:48] something that's so special to me and
[1:18:50] he's special to you too and that's
[1:18:52] that's this man William Branham
[1:18:56] and someone that that
[1:18:59] stood up against the organizations of
[1:19:01] his day way back in the 40s and 50s and
[1:19:04] said no you do not have to be a member
[1:19:08] of a church or an organization to know
[1:19:11] God
[1:19:13] you don't have to do it
[1:19:15] you have to know him
[1:19:18] and they hated him for it
[1:19:22] brother Bram said this
[1:19:25] he said
[1:19:27] in life story brother Jeremy that first
[1:19:29] quote that you had up there and
[1:19:31] and in here
[1:19:33] I've made many mistakes
[1:19:36] done many things that was wrong
[1:19:40] and I'll desire that you and the radio
[1:19:43] land and you that are present
[1:19:46] that you will not take my mistakes to be
[1:19:49] stumbling stones
[1:19:52] but Stepping Stones to bring you closer
[1:19:56] to the Lord Jesus
[1:19:59] think about Moses's mistakes that I was
[1:20:01] just talking about
[1:20:03] now I understand thank you
[1:20:06] then Moses made this mistake that I can
[1:20:08] understand this this mistake that the
[1:20:10] Patriarchs made
[1:20:11] thank you
[1:20:13] this mistake these mistakes that Paul
[1:20:15] made that Peter made and made them human
[1:20:19] it made him real
[1:20:22] and thank God that they're recorded in
[1:20:25] this book because now it makes it to
[1:20:28] where I can relate to them and I see
[1:20:30] some there's been so many critics that
[1:20:33] they attack the ministry of this man
[1:20:38] and they look and they pick and choose
[1:20:40] little things and from here and there
[1:20:42] and they put them together all these
[1:20:44] so-called mistakes and right here he
[1:20:46] says let them not be stumbling stones
[1:20:49] they take them and because of the
[1:20:54] ministry
[1:20:56] because of what we have done to this
[1:20:59] great man's message over the years
[1:21:02] making it something making him something
[1:21:05] that he is not and he didn't want to be
[1:21:07] we have taken what he said what he did
[1:21:10] and we have made it into something that
[1:21:12] it was not and here comes the critics
[1:21:14] and it's just giving them fuel for their
[1:21:16] fire
[1:21:18] and it has done more damage
[1:21:21] to brother branham's message
[1:21:24] not these critics
[1:21:27] but the ones that have made it into
[1:21:29] something that is not and teeded up for
[1:21:32] the devil
[1:21:33] I hate it
[1:21:35] let me tell you I love that man's
[1:21:37] message I love what he stood for I love
[1:21:40] what he did and for these people to be
[1:21:42] able to attack it it is the fault of the
[1:21:45] pulpits over these past 30 40 50 60
[1:21:48] years that have changed it and set it up
[1:21:51] to where people can come in and and make
[1:21:54] such a mockery of it
[1:21:57] that's why I always say if you want to
[1:21:59] hear Brother Brown's message listen to
[1:22:00] him on tape because he said it right
[1:22:03] and I love it
[1:22:05] it's part of my everyday life and it is
[1:22:08] absolutely beautiful quit trying to
[1:22:11] change it
[1:22:12] and so often
[1:22:15] I'm going off my notes and the Lord said
[1:22:17] okay
[1:22:20] he he said yes
[1:22:24] so often people take quotes
[1:22:28] and all they're doing is they're taking
[1:22:30] these quotes just to support their
[1:22:33] message that they want to preach and
[1:22:35] they're just using Brother Brown's
[1:22:37] message for their own good
[1:22:38] for their own doctrines
[1:22:40] and that is why there has been so many
[1:22:43] problems
[1:22:45] it's a shame
[1:22:50] think about
[1:22:52] let me say it again I love his message
[1:22:56] I stand for it he was a great man of God
[1:23:00] and I don't like what's happened to it
[1:23:04] maybe that's why he put me in this
[1:23:05] Pulpit I believe maybe it is
[1:23:09] it's wonderful
[1:23:11] don't come against that man
[1:23:14] and don't set him up for failure
[1:23:17] because he was not like that he did not
[1:23:19] teach these things that is so common in
[1:23:22] our churches today
[1:23:25] when you talk about him
[1:23:27] those the sword is going to come out
[1:23:33] think about David
[1:23:37] I think about David and Bathsheba
[1:23:42] what he did
[1:23:43] and how wrong
[1:23:46] David did he was he was out on his
[1:23:49] balcony and
[1:23:51] looks down and he sees this woman
[1:23:55] bathing
[1:23:57] looks down on her and the Flesh and
[1:24:00] David came out he was King you get out
[1:24:02] whatever he wanted
[1:24:04] in the world
[1:24:06] so he took this woman another man's wife
[1:24:08] awful awful sin
[1:24:11] took this man's this man's wife
[1:24:18] she became expecting
[1:24:20] had the man murdered
[1:24:22] this man Uriah
[1:24:24] a husband
[1:24:26] of that little
[1:24:27] that lady and
[1:24:29] and he um
[1:24:33] Prophet came to him
[1:24:36] and he tells the story about the lamb he
[1:24:38] says there was this this poor man that
[1:24:40] had this lamb and he loved this lamb and
[1:24:42] it was his only lamb and and he it was
[1:24:46] it was just everything to him and then
[1:24:48] this rich man comes in that has all of
[1:24:50] these herds and everything and he needs
[1:24:52] a sacrifice so he takes the man's lamb
[1:24:55] because he doesn't want to get he
[1:24:57] doesn't want to use any of his so he
[1:25:00] takes the man's lamb and he uses that
[1:25:04] David said I'll have that man killed
[1:25:09] David said you tell me who that is I'll
[1:25:11] take that man and he'll be killed and
[1:25:13] I'll restore this how dare he and and
[1:25:16] the prophet says David you are that man
[1:25:19] but God's not going to kill you for it
[1:25:23] David
[1:25:26] Uriah was dead there's all these
[1:25:29] problems the child that that was
[1:25:31] conceived ended up dying
[1:25:36] a horrible mistake
[1:25:39] Psalm 51 David was so heavy
[1:25:44] so sad he was repentive and that's the
[1:25:47] thing that we have so little of today is
[1:25:49] repentance
[1:25:51] we do things wrong the greatest
[1:25:55] hear David
[1:25:57] he did a horrible thing we do things
[1:26:00] wrong all of us but David repented
[1:26:02] listen to his words how he was feeling
[1:26:05] Psalm 51 he says
[1:26:08] he says have mercy upon me
[1:26:11] oh God according to thy loving-kindness
[1:26:14] according under the multitude of thy
[1:26:16] Tender Mercies blot out my
[1:26:18] transgressions
[1:26:20] Wash Me thoroughly from mine iniquity
[1:26:22] and cleanse me from my sin
[1:26:26] adultery murder
[1:26:33] for I acknowledge my transgression and
[1:26:36] my sin is ever before me
[1:26:39] how many people won't acknowledge when
[1:26:41] they're wrong
[1:26:42] how many people won't admit that they're
[1:26:45] wrong and they say
[1:26:47] they'll do something bad and then
[1:26:49] they'll make an excuse and get in a big
[1:26:51] fight no they'll lash out when they when
[1:26:54] they commit a sin or they hurt someone
[1:26:56] else
[1:26:57] and you can't do anything with those
[1:26:59] people they can't see that they did
[1:27:01] something wrong and they won't make it
[1:27:03] right because they can't see that they
[1:27:04] did something wrong
[1:27:06] but that was not the prophet here
[1:27:09] the prophet King
[1:27:10] David
[1:27:14] that's an arrogant person
[1:27:16] that can't admit when they're wrong
[1:27:18] that's an arrogant person that doesn't
[1:27:19] repent
[1:27:22] now listen to this verse number four
[1:27:26] against thee speaking to God against
[1:27:30] thee the only have I sinned and done
[1:27:32] this evil in thy sight that thou
[1:27:34] mightest be justified when thou speakest
[1:27:36] and be clear when thou judges
[1:27:39] so when we sin against each other
[1:27:43] David killed had Uriah killed he
[1:27:46] committed adultery and then he says Lord
[1:27:48] I've just I've sinned against you
[1:27:51] when we sin against each other
[1:27:53] we are sinning against God
[1:27:56] he's more important than all of us
[1:27:59] we need to always be careful when we sin
[1:28:03] I'll say it again when we sin against
[1:28:05] each other we are sinning against God
[1:28:13] against thee and the only have I sinned
[1:28:15] and done this evil in thy sight that
[1:28:17] thou mightest be justified when thou
[1:28:19] speakest and be clear when thou judges
[1:28:23] behold
[1:28:25] I was shaping an iniquity
[1:28:27] and in sin did my mother conceive me
[1:28:31] behold thou desire desire is truth in
[1:28:35] the inward parts and in the hidden part
[1:28:36] Thou shalt make me to know wisdom
[1:28:40] the Amplified version of that says this
[1:28:43] behold you desire truth in the innermost
[1:28:46] being and in the hidden part of my heart
[1:28:48] you make me no wisdom
[1:28:54] Purge me with hyssop
[1:28:56] and I shall be claimed clean wash me and
[1:28:59] I shall be wider than snow
[1:29:01] amen
[1:29:03] make me to hear joy and gladness that
[1:29:07] the bones which thou Hast broken May
[1:29:10] Rejoice Lord you may have broken my
[1:29:12] bones you may have brought me to this
[1:29:15] but in that in my suffering in the the
[1:29:21] repercussions because of my sin I am
[1:29:24] going to rejoice
[1:29:27] I will find gladness
[1:29:30] hide thy face from my sins Lord don't
[1:29:33] see my sins and blot out all of my
[1:29:36] iniquities thank God for the blood of
[1:29:38] Jesus Christ that he can't see our sins
[1:29:40] created me a clean heart oh God
[1:29:44] and renew a right Spirit Within Me cast
[1:29:48] me not away from my presence you can
[1:29:50] just sing it cast me not away from thy
[1:29:53] presence and take not thy Holy Spirit
[1:29:55] from me
[1:29:57] restore unto me the joy of thy salvation
[1:30:00] and uphold me with thy free spirit then
[1:30:03] will I teach transgressors thy ways and
[1:30:06] sinners shall be converted under thee
[1:30:09] look at the repentance and David even in
[1:30:11] my own sins even in my mistakes I'm
[1:30:15] going to teach others
[1:30:19] I was heard a brother
[1:30:22] preacher the other day
[1:30:24] he was he was telling a story about
[1:30:25] another Minister he was up there and he
[1:30:27] was preaching and he offended some
[1:30:29] people in the church
[1:30:32] and this Minister this pastor went to
[1:30:35] these people and he apologized
[1:30:38] he said I'm I'm sorry I didn't mean to
[1:30:40] offend you
[1:30:42] and what I said
[1:30:44] and this other brother this other Pastor
[1:30:46] he says you were wrong in doing that
[1:30:50] he says you went and you apologized he
[1:30:53] says when do we need an apology from the
[1:30:55] word for the word
[1:30:56] false
[1:30:58] absolutely wrong
[1:31:01] no no no no no no that's an arrogant
[1:31:04] spirit that says something like that
[1:31:07] we don't apologize for the word of
[1:31:09] course we don't and if I say something
[1:31:11] that offends you today
[1:31:13] I don't mean to do it but I believe I've
[1:31:16] been speaking the word of the Lord
[1:31:19] and we can talk it out if I have
[1:31:23] deliver me
[1:31:25] from blood Guiltless Guiltless
[1:31:27] guiltiness that means the guilt of
[1:31:29] bloodshed
[1:31:31] Uriah
[1:31:34] deliver me from blood guiltiness oh God
[1:31:37] that thou God of myself thou God of my
[1:31:41] salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud
[1:31:44] of thy righteousness
[1:31:46] so even in the guilt of everything that
[1:31:48] he done did
[1:31:50] he's still thanking the lord
[1:31:53] and he's able to get past it in his
[1:31:56] repentance friends
[1:31:58] I I see it in so many people we make
[1:32:01] mistakes we do things wrong
[1:32:04] get past it it's in the past
[1:32:09] you didn't do it as bad as David did
[1:32:12] oh Lord
[1:32:14] open now my lips
[1:32:16] and my mouth shall show forth thy praise
[1:32:19] for thou desirest not sacrifice else I
[1:32:23] would give it
[1:32:24] thou delightest not in burnt offering
[1:32:27] the sacrifice
[1:32:30] the sacrifices of God
[1:32:33] are a broken spirit
[1:32:35] a broken and contrite heart
[1:32:38] oh God thou will not despise
[1:32:42] the sacrifices of God are a broken
[1:32:44] Spirit when we repent
[1:32:47] Lord I'm sorry I feel so bad I want to
[1:32:51] make it right
[1:32:53] I've done all of these things in my past
[1:32:57] and I'm suffering for them today Lord
[1:33:00] I've made this mistake and that mistake
[1:33:02] I've I've messed up my life how can I
[1:33:04] come back from this
[1:33:07] David came back from it
[1:33:10] and if he could we can
[1:33:15] a man of great sin
[1:33:18] yet a man after God's Own Heart
[1:33:22] this man David
[1:33:26] I heard the other day it was
[1:33:29] we were out in the fellowship hall and I
[1:33:31] her brother Lionel and he was he was
[1:33:34] talking he was explaining to a brother
[1:33:36] what repentance means
[1:33:39] and it it really blessed me when he was
[1:33:44] saying it he was
[1:33:47] he was saying that
[1:33:49] that it means literally to go back
[1:33:53] and when you fall into the into sin
[1:33:58] you repent
[1:33:59] and you go back go back to that cross
[1:34:02] the Greek word for repent is metanoia
[1:34:05] the definition is this it denotes a
[1:34:09] change of mind
[1:34:11] as brother Lionel said
[1:34:14] a reorientation a fundamental
[1:34:17] transformation of Outlook of man's
[1:34:20] vision of the world and of himself a new
[1:34:24] way of living and loving God
[1:34:28] that's what that Greek word means to
[1:34:30] repent
[1:34:33] how beautiful
[1:34:34] the Jews
[1:34:37] they made the ultimate mistake when they
[1:34:41] crucified Jesus
[1:34:43] they're there and they said let his
[1:34:46] blood be upon us send him to the Cross
[1:34:51] they say crucify it pilate said what do
[1:34:54] you want me to do they say crucify him
[1:34:57] what a horrible
[1:34:59] awful mistake
[1:35:02] that they made
[1:35:04] yet
[1:35:05] as when Moses smote the rock water still
[1:35:09] came forward
[1:35:11] and that Water of Life came out of Jesus
[1:35:13] and it rested upon the Gentiles
[1:35:16] and here we are
[1:35:18] still blessed because of that great
[1:35:21] mistake that the Jews had made
[1:35:24] in Zechariah 12
[1:35:27] in a prophecy
[1:35:29] Zechariah says and they shall look upon
[1:35:31] me whom may have pierced speaking of the
[1:35:34] Jews
[1:35:35] and they shall mourn for him as one
[1:35:37] mourneth for his only son
[1:35:40] and shall weep bitterly for him
[1:35:42] as one that weeps over his firstborn
[1:35:45] so when they realized that they made
[1:35:47] this mistake
[1:35:48] how bad that they're going to feel but
[1:35:51] they will repent
[1:35:54] God Jesus you know he says
[1:35:58] they asked where do you get those scars
[1:36:00] he said in the house of my friends
[1:36:02] and these same people just like Joseph
[1:36:04] but God meant it
[1:36:07] for the good so that many others will be
[1:36:10] blessed so that water would come forth
[1:36:12] out of that rock
[1:36:15] and that word repentance that I was
[1:36:16] talking about how important it is for
[1:36:18] all of us
[1:36:19] and we don't we don't just
[1:36:24] not look at our faults we don't just
[1:36:27] just go by and not admit them but
[1:36:29] repentance is to go back as I said and
[1:36:32] have a new outlook on life
[1:36:35] there was a there was a time in Acts
[1:36:37] chapter 2 that this Holy Spirit had
[1:36:40] fallen they went out and they were
[1:36:42] preaching the gospel and they were
[1:36:43] Healing The Sick and there was just such
[1:36:44] Joy it was such an exciting time and and
[1:36:47] and all of these these Miracles were
[1:36:50] happening and and there was just such a
[1:36:52] stir and these people they look at Peter
[1:36:54] and James and John and all of them they
[1:36:56] said hey
[1:36:57] wow
[1:36:59] how do we get that
[1:37:01] Peter said these great words
[1:37:06] therefore he preaches a sermon and he
[1:37:09] says therefore let all the house of
[1:37:11] Israel know assuredly that God hath made
[1:37:13] the same Jesus whom you crucified
[1:37:16] as I just said
[1:37:18] both Lord and Christ
[1:37:21] Acts chapter 2 verse 36.
[1:37:23] now when they had heard this they were
[1:37:26] pricked in their hearts they were cut in
[1:37:28] their hearts
[1:37:30] and said unto Peter and unto the rest of
[1:37:32] the Apostles men and Brethren what shall
[1:37:34] we do
[1:37:35] then Peter said unto them repent
[1:37:40] repent
[1:37:42] it's the first thing brother Lyle did a
[1:37:45] wonderful job on Wednesday night he was
[1:37:47] talking about Acts chapter 19 and he was
[1:37:49] talking about baptism and and and Paul
[1:37:53] had come to this group that had listened
[1:37:55] to John the Baptist and they had learned
[1:37:57] from John the Baptist and they came to
[1:37:59] the waters and they were baptized by
[1:38:00] John the Baptist unto repentance
[1:38:04] the law was telling us that the old
[1:38:07] Customs were that when you needed to be
[1:38:10] cleansed part of it was you dip in the
[1:38:13] water and you come back up and it
[1:38:15] symbolizes being cleansed from your from
[1:38:19] your
[1:38:20] filthiness
[1:38:23] so John the Baptist is out there
[1:38:24] baptizing they would come to John they
[1:38:26] were saying I feel bad I've done wrong
[1:38:28] John baptized them
[1:38:32] so then these people
[1:38:36] Ephesus
[1:38:37] right these people in Ephesus
[1:38:41] were saying we we've repented we've done
[1:38:44] this and this man has taught us about
[1:38:45] these things and we believe John the
[1:38:48] Baptist and Paul says yeah
[1:38:50] but there's more
[1:38:53] they said have he said have you received
[1:38:55] the Holy Spirit
[1:38:57] since you've believed and you know what
[1:38:59] they said
[1:39:01] what do you mean
[1:39:03] what's the Holy Spirit we haven't
[1:39:04] learned about this yet
[1:39:07] how do we receive it Paul asked him how
[1:39:10] are you baptized
[1:39:12] and they were like well we were baptized
[1:39:14] with John he said no no it's not good
[1:39:16] enough
[1:39:17] there has to be a name associated with
[1:39:19] that baptism
[1:39:21] and that's why we are baptized in the
[1:39:24] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[1:39:27] there has to be a name associated
[1:39:33] repentance first
[1:39:36] than baptism
[1:39:38] than an infilling of the Holy Spirit
[1:39:40] that's how it usually happens
[1:39:42] so look at the mistakes of Moses
[1:39:44] Moses goes up there and he gets he gets
[1:39:47] himself all worked up and he's gonna lay
[1:39:49] the ax to the root of the tree as it
[1:39:51] says in the Bible from John the Baptist
[1:39:53] and he goes up and he rips him and he
[1:39:57] says you're a bunch of weasels basically
[1:40:02] that wasn't me Moses
[1:40:06] Moses Moses smote the rock big mistake
[1:40:09] but water came out and we drank
[1:40:16] and we look at the Patriarchs
[1:40:19] we see their mistakes
[1:40:21] trying to kill their own brother
[1:40:24] and yet God used it to save an entire
[1:40:27] country
[1:40:28] we look at the mistakes of Peter
[1:40:30] but Jesus gave him the Keys of the
[1:40:32] Kingdom we looked at the mistakes of
[1:40:33] Paul but God gave him a revelation
[1:40:35] beyond anything that had ever struck the
[1:40:37] Earth and he led countless people to
[1:40:40] Christ and we still read what that man
[1:40:43] wrote
[1:40:46] look at the mistakes of David
[1:40:48] yeah Christ was called the son of David
[1:40:52] so friends as the musicians come and
[1:40:55] we'll close
[1:40:57] what mistakes
[1:41:00] have you made
[1:41:02] or have I made that keep coming back in
[1:41:05] our minds
[1:41:06] and I know with me I
[1:41:08] that's something I struggle with
[1:41:10] is when I mess up boy it's hard for me
[1:41:13] to get over it
[1:41:15] but what mistakes have you made and you
[1:41:18] feel that you've you've shamed yourself
[1:41:20] or you've embarrassed yourself you've
[1:41:22] done something wrong what mistakes have
[1:41:24] you made that can compare to these
[1:41:26] people that I just read about
[1:41:28] and yet these are the greatest men that
[1:41:30] have ever walked the Earth
[1:41:32] our mistakes can't compare yet the enemy
[1:41:36] the devil just keeps throwing them in
[1:41:38] our mind
[1:41:40] but remember if there's no mistakes
[1:41:43] then there is no thirst
[1:41:45] for salvation God can take our mistakes
[1:41:48] if there's a tender heart and a
[1:41:51] willingness to repent like he did with
[1:41:53] these brothers God can take our mistakes
[1:41:56] and make it a blessing to everyone
[1:41:59] a blessing to the people
[1:42:03] the Bible teaches us
[1:42:05] to confess
[1:42:06] our faults one to another
[1:42:10] pray one for another
[1:42:13] and I believe that
[1:42:16] it was on my heart today
[1:42:20] to tell you all
[1:42:22] you make mistakes as you know most of
[1:42:25] you know it
[1:42:26] you make mistakes don't worry about it
[1:42:29] their mistakes
[1:42:31] those mistakes can be stepping stones
[1:42:34] as they were with all of these others
[1:42:36] those mistakes
[1:42:38] help other people so never ever condemn
[1:42:42] someone else of a mistake
[1:42:44] you make them too
[1:42:46] Jesus said in the most probably the most
[1:42:49] besides John 3 16 the most famous thing
[1:42:52] Jesus ever said when they said the
[1:42:54] disciples said teach us how to pray
[1:42:57] he says forgiveness of our trespasses as
[1:43:02] we forgive those who trespass against us
[1:43:04] doesn't say require them that they say
[1:43:06] sorry
[1:43:08] you just forgive them no matter what
[1:43:11] they do and repent of our mistakes I
[1:43:14] talked about baptism
[1:43:16] I talked about how important a baptism
[1:43:18] is and how baptism needs to be first
[1:43:23] has to come from repentance
[1:43:26] Lord I've done wrong
[1:43:28] I want to I want to come back and then
[1:43:31] you're baptized
[1:43:34] and there's a promise there
[1:43:37] we have
[1:43:39] been told sister Hattie are you still

[1:52:21] change

[1:52:30] resurrected being now it's not the water
[1:52:32] that doesn't
