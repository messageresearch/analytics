we can open up this Bible and learn more about your word and therefore learn more about you Lord pray that wisdom would be here with us tonight as we open up This Book of Joel and father that if there' be a need in the church this evening or any of those that are streaming in father that you would meet that me most of all Lord we want your will not our will or the will of the world but your will Lord in Jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated God bless you all it's good to see everyone out in the house of the Lord tonight Book of Joel is a um it's it's a really it's a great book it's an amazing book it's there's a lot of unknowns about Joel We don't know really we don't know When It Was Written because he doesn't name a king and we don't necessarily know if he was prophesying to the northern um tribe of uh of Israel the 10 tribes of Israel in the North or if he was uh prophesying to the southern tribes of Judah we don't we don't know the the um historic context of this but the Book of Joel is written to it doesn't really matter it does matter in in other books but the Book of Joel is a standalone book and it's um it's a book that's has a pretty amazing way that that we go through it and it's a book that has real life events that are happening and Joel and the Lord are taking these real life events that are happening and then they are used in a prophetic way saying that these times are coming into the future and so he's taking a a plague of locusts that comes through and just decimates the entire the entire land and he's saying that this is going to happen again in the future and he he uses it maybe as a as metaphorically speaking it happened actually and metaphorically speaking and prophetically speaking so as we dig into it in this book you'll see that the things that are happening right now in this book are a foreshadowing of things that are going to happen and then things that we are yet looking to see now the theme of The Book of Joel is the day of the Lord and you'll see that Joel mentions this multiple times through through the book and it's mentioned more actually by the prophet Joel than it is mentioned by any other prophet in the Bible so that's that's really the theme of The Book of Joel and what's what's going on is there's this as I said a plague of locust you know what a locust is it's like a grasshopper and in Northern Africa some they get big their uh their wingspan is is fairly big and they will um they could go for this this swarm of locust can go for tens of miles long and hund over a 100 feet tall so when this plague of locust comes over it will it'll block out the Sun and get dark and I'm I assume it's really a creepy thing when when they fly over and it's just absolutely devastating so we're going to be talking about this plague of locust that comes through and then Joel is going to be explaining the significance of this in the future so let's dig right into it let's dig into the The Book of Joel Joel chapter one and what we'll do is we'll read word by word at least for the first chapter maybe for the second chapter also and we'll see how time is going and then um we'll get through there's it's only three chapters we'll get through the third chapter and then I'd like to read um some things that brother brand said um about this Book of Joel at the end the word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of pul so now we know who wrote the Book of Joel and uh Joel is considered one of the minor prophets in the bible a minor prophet in the Bible just means that his book is shorter doesn't mean that he's any less than Isaiah or Jeremiah or Moses it just means that less is written from that Prophet so that's when we say a minor Prophet it's not in any way saying that this Prophet is less it's just saying that there's less that the prophet wrote In the book but this these prophecies that come from Joel are powerful amazing prophecies so in these three chapters is squeezed all kinds of great things hear this ye old men and give ear all ye inhabitants of the land hath this been in your days or even in the days of your fathers tell your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children tell another generation this right here is a tremendous verse and I love the way Joel just puts this right up in the front to tell your children and then your children will tell their children it's it's kind of like Joshua how Joshua told the stories that that happened with all the plagues that came on Israel and coming across the Jordan and he said now you tell your children and then you bring them back to some of these these things that we have set up and when they ask like this pile of stones where did this pile of stones come from what is this pile of stones then you can tell them how the children of Israel walked over walked through the the walked over the Jordan River on dry land and this what the what this Prophet Joel is saying here he's he's saying tell your children of what's going on right now and basically tell them what I'm saying and you know if you come especially on Wednesday nights and Sunday nights I'll give a lot of testimonies from my family about brother Brandon and about all the amazing things that happened in his ministry and really this is what I am doing is telling the people that these things actually happened I wasn't there but my parents told me and my parents were there and my parents saw these things but they did exactly what this Prophet Joel is saying tell your children about these things that happened they really did happen and then I tell my children and I tell you all and encourage you you tell your children that these things that many of my parents my grandparents and many of all of our parents and grandparents witnessed they happened and they were real and you can go back to those and you can draw strength from those knowing that God manifested himself in a mighty way back then and we can apply that to our own lives and Joel's here he's saying listen tell your children about these things that are happening that you're witnessing these great calamities and then have them tell their children then he says this that which the Palmer worm hath left the Locust eaten and that which the Locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm hath left the caterpillar eaten so we have this plague of Lo locust come through and he's describing it and he uses these words let me read another translation keep that one up there and it says this listen to this this is the English Standard Version what the cutting Locust left the swarming Locust has eaten what the swarming Locust left the hopping Locust has eaten and what the hopping Locust left the destroying Locust has eaten all of these the cankerworm and the Palmer worm and the Locust they are all the same bug they're the same grasshopper they are just at different levels of their maturity so when he's saying this he's saying that all of these things have come through they have have have grown up and each one of them does its own type of damage but it's the same little animal that's doing it a wakey drunkards now he's going to he's going to say now you've seen this this plague of locust come through you need to repent because God is in this and we know that from the prophets and we're starting into brother Lyall went into Hosea last week and you'll see a theme actually we've seen it through the whole Bible the prophet the people will sin the prophet will bring correction and then God's mercy will be manifested it's almost in every book and this one's no different awake ye drunkard and weep and howl all ye drinkers of wine because of the new wine for it is cut off from your mouth for nation is come up upon my land strong and without number whose teeth are the teeth of the lion and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion so the locusts come in but now it looks like a foreign Nation so we we see the plague of the Locust and now it looks like these locusts now represent a foreign Nation invading Israel now this could be as I said we don't know we can't really Place This Book of Joel in historic context we don't know exactly when it was this could be this Assyrian evasion Invasion that uh they took the C the captives in the northern part of Israel possibly it could be the Babylonian Invasion that we've gone through with the Book of Daniel and Jeremiah and Ezekiel and it could be another Invasion we don't know but it's showing here that this is an invasion coming from another country also and we'll see that it's proven a little bit later he hath laid my Vine waste and barked my fig tree he hath made it clean clean bear and cast it away the branches thereof are made white so we know first of all we know that this fig tree usually when a fig tree is mentioned in a symbolic way it represents the country of Israel so we we know that this this plague of locust that's coming on and as I said it could be hundreds of feet high and it could be tens of miles long and they come in so thick that they can black out the Sun and they just they eat everything and the the plagues that that he's describing happened it's happening against Israel now for their sins but do you remember it happened happened against Egypt years and years ago with one of the plagues I believe it's the E eth plague that came from God to on the Egyptians when Pharaoh's heart was hardened and he wouldn't allow the Hebrews to go and worship so God brought down these 10 plagues and brought pharaoh to his knees one of those plagues was locusts and now these this same plague is coming coming upon Israel for their Disobedience and he says this lament Like a Virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth the meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the Lord the priests the Lord's ministers mourn so we look and he's telling the ministers he your pastors and your ministers you repent and you pray the field is wasted and the land mourneth for the corn is wasted and the new wine is dried up the oil Land languishes languisheth so this is what happened when this plague of locust come through they they eat up everything so now there's no food let's say they eat up the wheat and and the the wheat's ready to harvest they they come through they they eat up all the the food they eat even the bark off the trees it says they eat the fruit off the trees they eat the grain everything is destroyed when this plague of locust come through so then what follows this a famine because there's no food to eat and if the rain and if there isn't rain late in the season then they're also going to probably be suffering the next year because their trees are destroyed so they want this rain to come and they don't have any food now so they're not going to have any food until they can regrow some crops and it's probably going to be a year so things are going to be really really hard starvation and these plagues of locust it doesn't just take the food right now it makes it to where you don't have any food for until the next Harvest so very very devastating thing this plague of locust I was um when I was in Jeffersonville we were working with u a group in Loi there was a typhoon that came through and just destroyed the country flooded the country flooded their crops so we had all of this runoff and all the corn and stuff that was planted it all got washed down so now they had nothing and they didn't have the hope of having anything because it wasn't time to plant the crops and they wouldn't grow until they planted them the next spring so that's when we were able to bring in food that they could eat to get them through until they could plant the crops and and get something the next year but a plague like this the plague of locust is like this this typhoon that came through it just destroys and that's kind of the key word it's a destroying thing be ashamed oh ye husband and how oh ye Vine dressers for the wheat and for the barley because the Harvest of the field is perished so everything's gone all their food is gone the vine is dried up the Fig Tree languisheth the pomegranate tree the palm tree also and the apple tree even all the trees of the field are withered because the joy is withered away from the sons of men I'm going to read some quotes at the end of service if we have time that will be um very applicable to that scripture good G yourself and lament ye priests howl ye Ministers of the altar come lie all night in sackcloth you Ministers of my God for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholdeth withholden from then from the house of your God sanctify ye a fast call a solemn assembly gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the Lord your God and cry unto the Lord so the prophet is crying out to the ministry and to the population of people to repent repent and to make a holy fast to gather the people together and cry unto the Lord because this is your only hope you don't have any food you need a miracle you need the Lord to come down and protect you like what we're praying for for this um for this state of of Florida right now and this hurricane that's bearing down only God can protect it and only God can allow it to be to to just destroy it's up to him man man does not have that power and here he is he's saying that the only thing that you have is you cry out to God and repent because he can alas for the day for the day of the Lord is at hand and as destruction from the almighty shall it come as I said the day of the Lord that's the theme of This Book of Joel It's mentioned multiple times and the the day of the Lord is something that it can be something that's great or it can be something that's terrifying and horrible and really it depends on which side you're on the day of the Lord came from no for Noah he had built this Ark it started to rain the water came up out of the ground that was a day that was the day of the Lord that came for Noah no Noah was saved and it was a wonderful day for Noah because he was safe and he saw the power of God and all the evil that surrounded him was destroyed but it was a horrible day for those Sinners that weren't on God's side it's the same thing with Moses the day of the Lord came from Moses came from Egypt and it comes and and here is here comes all the plagues and it was terrible for Pharaoh but it was wonderful for the Hebrews and they saw the power of God they saw hail come down like fire they saw the the Locust they saw Darkness they saw all of these great things and God protected them but he destroyed those that didn't serve God so we see the day of the Lord It's a wonderful thing and it is a terrible thing and it really depends on which side that you're on Jesus or Paul said in first Thessalonians he prophesied that the day of the Lord would come as a thief of in the night we look forward to that day we're praying Lord come Lord come quickly we want to see you we want to we want you to come and redeem this world and then there's others that if the Lord comes they would be cast out into Everlasting Darkness into the Lake of Fire it's a horrible thing there and it's a wonderful thing here is not the meat cut off before our eyes the food yay joy and gladness from the house of our God the seed is rotten under their clouds and the Garner lay desolate the barns are broken down for the corn is withered how do the beasts Gran the herds of cattle are per perplexed because they have no pasture ye the flocks of sheep are made desolate so not only are the people suffering and we think about us it's like oh the the Locust came in and ate my fig tree or they ate my crops but don't forget if you're a Rancher you don't have food you don't have grass to feed your cattle or to feed your sheep so you're so these sheep and these cattle they're going to die too because these locusts came in this famine is coming down because all the food is gone and it has a residual effect all the way through oh Lord to thee will I cry for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the Wilderness and the flame ha burned all the trees of the field the beasts of the field cry also unto thee for the rivers of water are dried up and the fire ha devoured the pastures of the Wilderness chapter 2 blow ye the trumpet in Zion and S sound an alarm in my Holy Mountain let all the inhabitants of the land tremble for the day of the Lord cometh for it is nigh at hand and you can see it was a it was a dire need the day of the Lord was there for them remember it's twofold he's saying that this is what's happening right now and he's going to say that it's also going to happen in the future and it's going to be way worse than staring to death because of a famine a day of darkness and gloominess a day of clouds and a thick Darkness as the morning spread upon the mountains a great people and strong there ha there hath not been ever ever the like neither shall anym after it even to the years of many generations so he's he's foreshadowing yeah you're seeing this but there is something big that's coming let's turn to Matthew chapter 24 and here the Lord Jesus actually refers back to Joel Same Spirit as the Lord Jesus is prophesying Matthew 24 let's start with verse three now we know that this is the Tribulation time this is a hard time that the Lord Jesus is prophesying that's coming it's the six seals that are in this Matthew 24 it's the tribulation it's the plagues there's all kinds of Calamity that's happening here and as he sat upon the Mount of Olives speaking of the Lord Jesus the disciples came to him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world and Jesus answered and said unto him take heed that no man deceive you a Commandment that is constantly told be careful don't be deceived for many shall come in my name saying I am the Christ many shall come in my name what is that I come in the name of Jesus Christ is what they would say it's easy to say that but are you really sent from God he's saying that these false prophets will come take heed that no man de deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am the Christ and shall deceive many and ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that ye be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilence and earthquakes in diverse places all these are the beginning of Sorrows this is just the beginning of it then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you should be hated of all Nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another one of the signs of the end is this great Discord especially among the religious churches especially among the religious people there's this bickering and this fighting and it's a sign right here Jesus says it's coming and many false prophets shall arise and deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that shall endure to the end the same shall be saved trust in the Lord endure keep your testimony keep trusting in God and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the End come skip to verse 29 immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not shall not give her light and the Stars shall fall from Heaven and all the powers and the powers of of the heavens shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven with power and great Glory it's like in the Book of Joel there was a time of tribulation but there's always hope God always gives you a way out he always gives you hope and he will always make a way for those that truly love him and those that put him first and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the Four Winds from one end of Heaven to the other now learn a parable of the Fig Tree we know what the Fig Tree is as I said before when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves you know that summer is nigh then the last verse 44 says this therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh now with that Prophecy from the Lord Jesus that Spirit let's go back to Joel chapter 2 verse three a fire devoureth before them and behind them a flame burneth and the land is as a Garden of Eden before them and behind them a desolate Wilderness yay and nothing shall Escape them the appearance of them is the as the appearance of horses now he's talking about these locusts the appearance of them is as the appearance of horses and of Horsemen and they shall run let's turn to Revelation chapter n again this is one of those things where this is an application to the Future Revelation verse chapter 9 ver verse one and the fifth angel sounded and I saw a star fall from Heaven under the Earth and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit and he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the Sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of a pit and there came out of the smoke locusts upon the Earth and unto them was given power as the Scorpions of the Earth have power and it was commanded to them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree but only those men which have not the Seal of God in their foreheads that seal of God is nothing short of the Holy Spirit and to them it was given that they should not kill them but that they should be tormented five months and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when he striketh a man and in those days shall men seek death and shall not find it and shall desire to die and Death Shall flee from them and the shapes of the Locust were like under horses prepared under battle remember I just read in Joel and the shapes of the Locust were like un horses prepared under battle and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold and their faces were as the faces of men and their hair as the hair of women and their teeth as the teeth of lions and they had breastplates as it were breastplates of iron and the sound of their wings was as a sound of Chariots of many horses running to battle and they had tails like unto scorpions and there were stings in their tails and their power was to hurt men five months and they had a king over them which is the Angel of the bottomless pit whose name in the Hebrew tongue is aaden but in the Greek tongue hath his name apalon one woe is passed and behold there come two woes more Hereafter very similar to what we're reading right now in the Book of Joel back to Joel chapter 2 verse 5 like the noise of Chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble as strong people set in battle array before their face the people shall be much pained all their faces Shall Gather Blackness they shall run like Mighty Men they shall climb a wall like the men of war and they shall March everyone on his ways and they shall not break their ranks neither shall one thrust another they shall walk everyone in his path and when they fall upon the sword they shall not be wounded they shall run to and fro in the city and they shall run upon the wall and they shall climb up upon the houses and they shall enter in at the Windows like a thief the Earth shall Quake before them and the heavens shall tremble and the sun and the moon shall be dark and the Stars shall withdraw their shining remember back to what Jesus said in Matthew chapter 24 Matthew 24 and the Lord shall utter his voice before his army for his Camp is very great for he is strong that executed the word for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible and who can abide it so now God's sending in his power to counter this other power that's coming another translation in verse 11 says this the Lord utters his voice before his army for his Camp is exceedingly great he who executes his word is powerful for the day of the Lord is great and very awesome and who can endure it therefore now therefore also now sayeth the Lord turn ye even to me with all your heart and with fasting and with weeping and with mourning a common theme as I've said before turn to the Lord repent and Rend your heart and not your garments and turn unto the Lord your God for he is gracious and merciful and slow to anger and of great kindness and repenteth him of the evil so he's saying don't take the traditional thing of tearing open your garment he's telling them to tear open your heart instead don't just go through the motions don't just make it look like here I'm repenting really repent get down on your knees and cry out to God and then a promise right here as always God will forgive you God will take care of it who knoweth if he will return and repent and leave a blessing behind him even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the Lord your God blow the trumpet in Zion sanctify a fast call a solemn assembly gather the people sanctify the congregation assemble the other Elders gather the children and those that suck the breast let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber and the bride out of her closet so Joel is saying bring everybody bring the babies you just got married skip the honeymoon come down everybody come everybody come in let the priests the Ministers of the Lord weep between the porch and the Altar and let them say spare thy people oh Lord and give not thine Heritage to rep to reproach that the Heathen should rule over them wherefore should they say among the people where is their God then will the Lord be jealous for his land and pity his people yay the Lord will answer and say unto his people and remember here we go we're going to start getting into the prophetic yay the Lord will answer and say unto his people behold I will send you corn and wine and oil and ye shall be satisfied therewith and I will no more make you or reproach among the Heathen so he saying humble yourself whether there's famine that was on Israel at this time or in a future time humble yourself before the Lord and I'll take care of it with me all things are possible but I will remove far off from you the northern Army and will drive him into a land Barren and desolate with his face towards the E East and his hinder part towards the utmost sea and his stink shall come up come up and his ill saver shall come up because he hath done great things fear not Oh Land be glad and rejoice for the Lord will do great things be not afraid believe Stephanie I were talking the other night I believe that's the most common commandment in the Bible don't fear not don't be afraid be Not Afraid ye Beasts of the field for the pasture of the Wilderness do spring for the tree beareth her fruit and the Fig Tree and the vine yield their strength be glad you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord for for you for your God rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former Reign moderately for he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain prophet of Joel is referring to that when you sew the seed so when you have a field and a husbandman by the way is the King James version of the a farmer the one that that owns that takes care of the field so when this farmer goes and he SWS the seeds you need rain you need some sort of moisture to fall on that that's the former rain that's the first rain that you need and then that that seed is germinated in the ground it takes root and then your crop starts to grow and then it grows through the summer and then towards the fall at the end of the of the Harvest when the Harvest is coming you need another rain to really ripen that fruit and to make sure you get the best fruit before you you pick it you need some rain in there that's the latter rain so you have the rain that falls first and then you have the latter rain that really ripens that fruit James 5:7 says be patient therefore Brethren unto the coming of the Lord behold the husbandman the husbandman remember that's the farmer the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he receives the early and the latter rain so be also be also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh so we plant the seed the Lord sends the rain to germinate that seed and then he sends the rain to ripen the Harvest the former and the latter rain and the floors back to Book of Joel verse number 24 and the the floors shall be full of Wheat and the Vats shall overflow with wine and oil so this is a time of prosperity and I will restore to you the years that the Locust hath eaten and the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you so again back to that same Locust at different stages and God is saying that he's going to restore what was lost during that time and you shall eat plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed my people shall never be put to shame and ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed now a prophecy that we are all very familiar with and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit one of the greatest days in history is what this is prophesying and I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth and blood and fire and pillars of smoke and the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord come and it shall come to pass that who whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be delivered for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be Deliverance as the Lord hath said and in the remnant of whom and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call now let's fast forward about who knows it could be 400 years it could be 800 years but let's fast forward from that time to Acts chapter 2 we saw in the book of Acts that the Lord Jesus had promised that if I go away then the comforter will return so here they are they're in this Upper Room 120 people in this upper room and they knew this promise Jesus said just to wait there until you are endued with power from up on high and here they are and then here comes the Holy Spirit into the building like sounds like a rushing Mighty Wind there was tongues of fire on each of them they go out they're filled with the Holy Ghost they go out they start prophesying they start speaking in other tongues they start doing Miracles this great thing happened and then other people see it they're like we want that and that's how we should be as Christians friends let me tell you wherever we go whatever we do if the people that that you work with if the people that you see if the people are not uh taking you in in high regard and saying I want what that person has then we are doing something wrong and let me tell you the most important thing is that love 1 Corinthians chapter 13 when we lose that love then we lose the admiration of the world here in the book of Acts chapter 2 they wanted their hearts were cut and they said what do we need to do but Peter lifting up but Peter standing up and they and some were making fun of them they're saying oh they're drunk you know it's the the third hour of the day or whatever it was and they're they're already drinking and they're drunk and they're stumbling around they're doing all this strange strange stuff and Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them you mean of Jud you Judea and all that dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken unto my words for these are not drunken as you suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day what is that brother L is that 9:00 in the morning thing this seeing this is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel Peter knew the scriptures he had read this book that we're reading tonight and he says that's it this is the Fulfillment of that scripture and it and then now Peter goes back and he quotes this Prophet it shall come to pass in the last days saith God that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dream dreams and on my servants and upon my handmaids will I pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy it had just happened that is so awesome to me that this prophecy was sitting in the book for hundreds of years just there how many priests how many rabbis read that and had no idea what it means and that's brothers and sisters we have we have to be careful in doing that we can hear a prophecy but really we don't know what any prophecy is until it happens the interpretation of a prophecy is the Fulfillment of the prophecy and that is what happened right here with Peter he remembered these words of Joel and he says this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel where was I Verse 18 and on my servants and upon my handmaids will I pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy so it is a just that Holy Spirit had just come they go out and they're stumbling around and they're speaking in these strange tongues and it's it's it's um recognizable to the different ones that are there and they're like wow they're speaking my language and there there there's these great things going on and Peter's like yeah this is that and he comes and he's preaching this sermon and I will show wonders in heaven and signs on in the Earth beneath in the earth beneath blood and fire and Vapor of smoke and the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and notable day of the Lord CA come I wonder I wonder if he had his Bible if he had his scroll or if it just came to him if he just remembered and he just quoted well we'll never know we'll ask him one day but it's said Peter did you have your Scroll of Joel with you or did you just remember it what it took the interpretation came down to Peter and he said this is the Fulfillment of that where was I 20 and the sun shall be turned to Darkness and the moon into blood before the great and notable day of the Lord and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved ye men of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you by Miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you as you yourself know him being delivered by the determinant counsel and the the for knowledge of God ye have taken and by Wicked hands have crucified and slain whom God hath raised up not only is this prophecy about the Holy Spirit coming down but Peter takes it and he uses it like we should do every time you take something that the prophets say and it should always point to Jesus Christ and this is what's happening right here where was I sorry whom God hath raised up having Loos the Pains of death because it was not possible that he should be Holden of it for David speaketh of him concerning I foresaw the lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that I should not be moved therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover also my flesh shall Rest In Hope so many say that acts and many of the the the readings that you'll read about this this prophetic Ministry of Joel many say that that is just to the Jews but it's not because Peter said for This Promise is unto you and your children and many that as many that are far off me and you even as many as our Lord God shall call that's me let's go to chapter three for behold in those days and in that time when I shall bring again the Captivity of Judah and in Jerusalem in Jerusalem I will also gather all nations and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat and will plead with them there for my people and for my Heritage Israel whom they have scattered among the Nations and parted my land and they have cast lots for my people and have given a boy for a harlot and sold a girl for wine that they might drink yay and what have ye to do with me oy and ziden and all the coasts of Palestine will you render me a recompense and if you recompense me Swift recompense me swiftly and speedily will I return to recompense upon your own head because you have taken my silver and my gold and have carried into your temples my goodly Pleasant things the children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have you sold to the grecians that might be that might remove them far from their border behold I will raise them out of the place whether ye have sold them and will return your recompense upon your own head and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah and they shall sell them to the sabians to a people far off for the Lord has spoken it procla Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles prepare War wake up the Mighty Men let all the men of War draw near let them come up beat your plow shears into swords and your pruning hooks into Spears let the weak say I am strong notice he calls the Gentiles to this is contrary to a scripture in Isaiah that says the very opposite it says here beat your plow shares into swords and your pruning hooks into Spears those are those are um tools that you use to to till the ground and he says take those and make weapons out of those but in Isaiah he says take your swords and make them into tools that you can tell tell the ground this prophecy here from Joel Isa that prophecy is coming that peace is coming the Prince of Peace the Mighty God but now late 1940s this was fulfilled with Israel and here comes from the Holocaust and all these horrible things that happened here come the Jews back to their Homeland as God had commanded I'm going to bring you back brings them back and you see pictures of when they when they started in the 30s and in the 40s here they are they have a rifle in one hand and they're picking oranges with the other and taking care of things and and and ready to fight and look what's happening right now they've got F35 stealth Fighters they've got the they've got the greatest of all the militaries and and they're they're they're protecting themselves and here they are they have beaten those those stuff to Tool the ground and they have made weapons with it to protect themselves you go back we went through the book of Nehemiah there they are they standing they're they're building this wall they got a brick in one hand they got a sword in the other hand and here they are and still these Jews are ready to go man don't shoot at them because they shoot back and that's how that's what's going on right now they they are ready to fight Joel's prophesying that here and it's coming Peace by the grace of God the Prince of Peace is coming where everything's going to be wiped out but there's going to be some hard times coming Joel says assemble yourselves and Come All Ye Heathen and gather yourselves together roundabout tother cause thy Mighty ones to come down oh Lord let the Heathen be wakened and come up into the valley of Jehoshaphat for there will I sit to judge all the Heathen roundabout put ye put ye in the sickle and harvest The Ripe come come get you down for the Press is full the fats overflow for their wickedness is great multitudes multitudes in the valley of decision for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision the sun and the moon shall be darkened and the Stars shall withdraw their shining and the Lord also shall Roar out of Zion and utter his voice from Jerusalem and the heavens and the Earth shall Shake but the Lord will be the hope of his people and the strength of the children of Israel so shall ye show that I am the Lord your God dwelling in Zion my Holy Mountain then shall Jerusalem be holy and there shall no strangers pass through her anymore and shall come to pass in that day that the mountains shall drop down new wine and the hills shall flow with milk and the rivers of Judah shall flow with Waters and the fountain shall come forth out of the house of the Lord and shall water in the valley of sham Egypt shall be a desolation and Edom shall be a desolate Wilderness for the violence against the children of Judah because they have shed innocent blood in their land wow what a current scripture but Judah shall dwell forever in Jerusalem from generation to generation for I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed for the Lord dwelleth in Zion and the close of the Book of Joel what a powerful powerful book of of things that are going on then with Joel and they represented things to come now I want to I want to say on uh on Sunday night I um I shared as we were sharing some testimonies and oh I heard some just wonderful things brother Stephen um what what just tremendous um testimony that you gave and and really that that everybody did and um it was just it was just a really good night I especially um appreciated sister Martha's testimony where sometimes we just need Lord I just need a touch and we get into that place well then I came up and I I shared some things at the end and just wanted to warn congregation just be careful about the spirit of the sectarian denominational Spirit where we draw a circle around ourselves and say we are special it's not right and let me tell you it is not if you claim and most of us do I don't see anyone here that is new if you claim to believe brother branam brother brandham did not teach those things This Book of Joel in my opinion and I've I grew up listening to brother brandom most days of my life really I listened to every tape from 1947 to 1965 and I um I love them everyone I know it I know it and one thing that is a common theme in brother Brown's message very very common I would say the most common theme is from This Book of Joel now he doesn't quote it I mean quotes it all the time but brother brandom Likens this this Locust this evil little creature that destroys the plant he Likens it to the denominational system and the denominational spirit I can categorically say he preached more about that than anything else in his whole Ministry he came to tear that thing down and let me tell you William brandom hated the denominational sectarian spirit and if you don't believe me I'd say turn on a tape pick one anyone and he'll be saying that I want to read a few quotes to you that he talks about these this evil little creature Palmer worm Locust cankerworm caterpillar 1959 now what do they do what has their translators or the men done that uh that quote was correct or the or the church men done what's the organization done wrapped up an old denominational rag around in order to be popular with the rest if I have to eat soda crackers and drink branchwater and be martyred I'll stand for God's truth and die on the stump that's right that's not no man the pope of Rome or bishop or Cardinal can't withstand that yes sir what's the matter what the Palmer worm left what the Methodist left the Baptist eaten what the Baptist left the Pentecostal eaten what a place the lifelines are all gone this destroying Spirit next quote is from uh the same same sermon so help me God uh one there you go so help me God let me have gumption enough let me have principle enough let me be man enough let me be Christ enough to stand alone if I stand have to stand that way and tell the truth and stand yes sir I'd rather preach the gospel to five people than have the millions that does here tell tell the truth I'll never compromise I wanted this because God had told me these Great Signs and things that's being produced like the manifestation of his resurrection and so forth it's for the church those poor people out there and bound in them Creeds and things they've been so undocumented like embalmed God bless your heart I won't leave you in that condition I'll tell you what God Said but I will restore to you all that the caterpillar has eaten and the canker worm has eaten and all that the Palmer worm has eaten I will restore sayeth the Lord so help me I make this Prophecy Before the coming of the Lord the true Apostolic Faith the true Apostolic teaching the true Bible Spirit the true it's on its road now trying to eat its way up and grow out again the Pentecostal had it to start with what did they do they draw a little rind around it and begin to to nominate and he cut it off and he cut it right off that's exactly right here come along where the Lord sent these gifts these humble little gifts that he gave me they kept coming and they wanted me to be a lad rain outp made an organization out of it wanted me to come to join the assemblies I've stood right in the midst of every bunch that's hanging out there right there at the stump of the tree and said this is the foundation cut off these Old Rag lines here so the life can get into you that you'll have prophecies and you'll have discernment you'll have the spirit you'll have power you'll have the restoration of the true church when you get back to the True Vine and the true life it can't come through a rag that drops right down and says it was another day it's another day it's forever the same he is Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end absolutely you'll have to come back to the foundation for Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't Prevail against it what is that rock you tape listeners that rock is the that's this is Peter and Jesus that rock is the revelation of who Christ is next quote it gets better brother Aaron I mean it's good now watch back in Joel in the second chapter where I preached on here not long ago the four insects what the Palmer worm left and the caterpillar eat with the caterpillar eat the Locust eaten you remember the preaching on that I think it was here in California at the breakfast I believe it was in Phoenix what the Methodist left the Baptist eaten what the Baptist left the Pentecostal eaten and tore the whole Vine down but i r restore sayeth the Lord and watch that same insect is the same thing only in different stages the Palmer worm becomes a caterpillar and so forth and on down and it's an insect and that's an insect starting eating off brotherly love I read it again started eating off brotherly love taking the Bible and substituting something else I'll read that one again taking the Bible and substituting something else and I give the four major things and proved it by the scripture the things that eat out the teaching of the true word of God brotherly love as Paul said already started in 1 Corinthians 13 all those things how they eat it up and just eat the church plumbed down to a stub but he said I will restore sayeth the Lord that's right all the years that they had eaten and all the things that they had done notice Israel notice Israel when you has always been the Fig Tree when you see this tree putting forth its buds what the generation that sees Israel become a nation that generation will not pass until it be fulfilled watch don't you see it here look at them now God God has always had to drive the Jews and they never had the Holy Spirit many of them wouldn't even believe their prophets they Messengers and he had to drive them and that's what he's going to have to do to the Gentile Church he's going to have to break down these denominational barriers we're letting communism start eating eating around us and then we'll all have to come together God will make his word fulfilled because the Covenant is unconditional not if you will will we don't make a deal with God not if you will I will but I have already done it that's right oh I love that that just makes me feel religious does me too next next quote then this little fellow died out he become a locust that was the next stage that was the next stage was a locust now what does that Locust do a locust eats the leaves that's right a locust takes onto the leaves what the Palmer worm left he left the leaves he eat the fruit off the tree then what took then what took in the locust come to eat eat what the Palmer worm left now what did he do what did this Palmer worm do destroyed the leaves what's the leaves for destroying Divine Fellowship that's right now he's a presbyterian we don't have nothing to do with them are you serious now now he's a presbyterian I won't have nothing to do with him and how many times have we heard something like that from our churches oh they're Baptist they're Presbyterian they're nominal do you think brother Brandon was for that kind of a spirit yet it's rampant he was not for that he's a presbyterian we won't have nothing to do with him he's Nazarene he's Pentecostal he's this or that or the other we won't have nothing to do with him because he don't belong to our group have a meeting up here for healing of the sick huh our church don't even believe in it see there you do what did the old old Locust what did the little old Locust do he cut off the he cut the fellowship off and that's right he took all the fellowship what is fellowship what does the leaves do it makes it cool where the birds fly under the leaves cool off there's your tree again and he shall be like a tree that's planted see all right where the people can come and sit down under the The Fellowship of the Holy Spirit and cool off a bit I'm going to brag for a minute this is the and I told somebody this is the best church I have ever seen as far as welcoming people come sit down in the shade enjoy service we're going to love you and I want us to continue I want us to get even better next quote and I said to a little woman the other day poor little woman she belonged to a great dignified Church down she said she's dying with cancer went down to pray for her brother Roy Roberson here one of the trustees sent me down there and the poor little thing sitting there dying with cancer and she said I said I said are you a Christian she said sir I don't know what to say said I went to a certain church and said she started crying I said' what's the matter she said I just couldn't dress right said they looked down upon me H oh there you are see you're there you're uncomfortable see but the Bible said that we are to assemble ourselves together in Heavenly places oh my what all alike why I I tell you what what this will do it'll make a pair of overalls in a tuxedo suit put their arms around each other and call each other brother sure will it'll make an old Calico dress I have no idea what that is do you sisters know Sister Sister Heather you know what that is calico dress I don't okay old Calico dress put her arms around silk and satin and say sister how are you this morning praise God I love that that is just brother John that's that's our church man and it's it feels good and we need to continue on on that's right it will it's joy peace love Faith in the word longsuffering gentleness patience set down in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus cool off a little while that's what the leaves did but what did the old locust did he come around eat them leaves off and said you belong to ours or you don't belong to anybody so he took all the cool coolness out of the spirit took all the coolness of the spirit out he fixed himself a Creed all right now we got to go on I could stay on I could stay a long time on that old Locust I'm sure he could we can close as I said my understanding of brother bram's message this was his core was against this sectarian denominational way and he likened it to this Critter that swarms in and kills the plant it kills the fellowship it kills the ability for you to invite someone to church and for them to feel comfortable here it destroys that it destroys as he said in these in and I read I don't know how many quotes he kept going back to love and how it destroys that love because of certain doctrines and we brothers and sisters we are I'm not saying us I'm saying the message ranks is guilty of that it has always been my greatest desire to have a church that we can invite people to and that they could come here and they could feel comfortable I believe we have it and I want to continue on but that is not the case in other places and as you said as as I read this from brother brandom that woman said I can't I don't look like they look and brother brandom said ah there it is right there so we need to always be careful I believe we're headed in the right direction I do not sacrificing Holiness by no means continue on serving the lord we need to pray more we need to be more of a Christ we need to always do more and more and more but we also have to understand if we say we believe this man we have to know what he preached and we have to see his number one focus and that was this denominational spirit that is the same as this Locust that comes in and destroys Daniel you can come to close I could read quote after quote I tell you what pick pick a tape just pick one go into the table pick one and tell me if he doesn't preach about it it was his message and it's a wonderful message and I think that we should get back to it we should get back to what he taught because he had he had something that we need that's why I love way the way Joel starts this he said tell your children about it teach your children about these things tell them for those that knew him what kind of a man he was tell them about the Miracles that you saw show them that God's Alive today because this time's coming these prophecies that come out of This Book of Joel they are are powerful and they're the closing of time Jesus quoted them Peter quoted him the Book of Revelation says the same thing it's a hard time coming but our hearts need to be right and we need to be right [Music] Daniel Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see [Music] you I want to see you and Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord and Open the Eyes of my heart I want to see you and I want to see you to see high and lifted up shining in the light of your glory and pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see I'm looking for a [Music] scripture the Apostle John I remember brother brandom telling a story about him when he got in his old age he's the only one of all the disciples that died of old age and here is here is in his old age and he would just cry out Children love each other just love one another even in his old age he saw that that is the most important thing and he himself wrote these three words he said God is love it is so important brothers and sisters it is this denominational system started with the Catholic church and boy did it do damage and what it does is it brings it doesn't breathe love it brings jealousy and it brings it breeds hatred it bre breeds division it breeds a um fear it it breeds a spirit that that you think that that you're better than someone else and it just plays on the weaknesses of human beings and it is today it's a strong as it's ever been and that destroying Locust comes in and takes the leaves it takes the all the way takes the bark off of it and kills the plant and then and then when he when he kills all of the fruits when he kills the ability of the plant to be able to bring forth food for the people then it brings a famine and that famine is prophesied to come and not just a famine for food but a famine for hearing the word of God and we're living close to those days brother Mark would you come and and close let's all [Music] stand Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord and Open the Eyes of My Heart and I want to see you and I want to see you open the eyes and Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord and Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see [Music] you amen that was a wonderful wonderful message there going through the Book of Joel there and and just seeing how that uh I was just listening uh to a tape on the on the way uh we drove from Jeffersonville we're from the Jeffersonville area for the last nine years and and um like I said we Fellowship Brother Brad Burgess and brother Daniel Andes and them and and they said to send their greetings and we told them we're coming out here and they really love you all and but we were listening to that message just simply Called Love in 1956 and and uh really speaking on the things brother said just like uh preaching in Joel there we we listen to it it's the truth and um he said love can conquer all diseases love can conquer um any situation you're in love is is the main them that's what he spoke in that message and it's a truth I I'm so thankful that the brother was admonishing you and that cuz it's it's it's wonderful that's that's the right way to go so let let's just pray dear heavenly father we're just so thankful Lord that you've chosen us Lord Jesus there's nothing good in ourselves Lord but but lord it's because you put it in US Lord to believe your word word Lord and to see the day that we're living in Lord Jesus we don't want to take it for granted Lord we we just appreciate you so much Lord Jesus we can't do anything without you but through you Lord we believe we can do all things Lord and Lord we just pray Lord that you let these words that we heard Lord sink into our hearts Lord Jesus Lord we desire to be more like you as the prophet said we never want to put a a period at the end of our faith but a comma and that we just want to believe more of you Lord we just want to see more of you Lord as our brother said sometimes um even though we might hear the word we might read it we pass over it many times but when you reveal it to our hearts Lord it's a different story Lord becomes part of our lives and and that's we desire Lord just more of you in our lives to show it to those around us and that can be effect Lord to our those that we work with and go to school with and our neighbors Lord and and those that we sit next to in the Pew Lord we want to be effect Lord upon others Lord there will be a time as we heard that it'll be perfect rest Lord but we realize that time isn't now we've got a fight on our hands Lord that that we know that Devil's coming at us every day but but Lord Jesus you said you raise up an a stand and you certainly have Lord and we're so thankful for your word for your spirit Lord that leads and guide us please be with us now Lord as we go to our homes Lord let us Lord as we depart Lord from this building may your presence go with each of us Lord in our cars and our homes Lord and we'll be quick to give you the glory in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen see you high and lifted up shining in the light of your glory and pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy [Music] I am uh I'm biased but I'm very proud of this congregation I um I I really appreciate the welcoming Spirit brother Lyall sister Heather God bless your hearts for always being sister hope God bless your heart I just appreciate the the and all of us really but I appreciate whenever we see somebody new that comes in they are welcomed let's always keep that Spirit brothers and sisters I believe that is one of the things that I used to do is I used to ride my bike around town in Jeffersonville and I talk to Old Folks sitting on their porches and try to get stories about brother Brandon one of the things and this was universally that all of them who never went to church and never they they didn't they didn't follow his teachings or anything but one thing that he that they always said is he was my one of my best friends he made everyone feel like they were very special I remember one time I was I rid my bike up to this this lady she was sitting outside these low-income apartments on um on 10th Street and um no it was on uh 8th Street and I went up to her and she had a circle around her mouth where she had been smoking cigarettes for so long and and her mouth was she just looked at and and her lips were stained from the nicotine and I walked up to her and and I said uh I said ma'am I said you ever heard of a man named William brandham she said oh yes she said he was a prophet of God she said he was so kind to me and my family and told me a couple stories about him and and how honored that that lady was to have met him and the impression that he made on her why wasn't the Miracles it was the love that that man had and that's the love that I desire to have I believe that's a love that Jesus Christ himself had but I am unbias brother Mark we've got a great church here and I'm very very proud of him and and we're brother Brandon was greeting all these different churches I think they were on the the radio hookup and he would greet them and he'd say um looking for the coming of the Lord and this person and looking for the coming of the Lord and that person brother we're looking for the coming of the same Lord that you're looking for God bless you brother and sisters you're dismissed I pray the Lord will give you a good evening and give you a good remainder of the week and hope to see you on Sunday we have a special guest U brother Ryan long will be ministering for us on Sunday morning and then on Sunday night we will uh I want to pray I want the church to pray for Israel I want the church to pray for the um Calamity that's going on in Florida and North Carolina and
