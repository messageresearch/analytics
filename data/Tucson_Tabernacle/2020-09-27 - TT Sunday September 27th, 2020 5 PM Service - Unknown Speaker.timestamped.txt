[45:47] it was god that was speaking through
[45:49] that prophet
[45:50] amen so a prophet is a mouthpiece of god

[47:32] sinning against me
[47:35] and amalek said i'm sinned against you

[50:27] that to be raised up
[50:29] amen to eat that bride tree all the way
[50:31] down
[50:33] that's right now the prophet of god said
[50:35] that when
[50:36] when that that bride tree started uh he
[50:39] said it started in
[50:40] in eden one place and and how god had to
[50:44] get that little crop and put them on the
[50:46] ark and carried them over amen
[50:48] but i love what he said on the day of
[50:50] pentecost
[50:51] when he started that bride tree and he
[50:53] said it came to a full blossom
[50:56] oh it was looking good amen in the
[50:58] church
[50:59] had the power amen the act of the holy
[51:01] ghost was in the apostles
[51:03] it wasn't nothing for someone shadow to
[51:06] pass and they were instantly healed amen
[51:08] it wasn't nothing for peter and the
[51:11] disciples to walk
[51:12] amen in this place and they saw this man
[51:14] that was lame
[51:15] and peter said look we don't have
[51:17] nothing but seven go have we
[51:20] not amen but such that we have what
[51:23] rise up or raise up our rise up and wall
[51:26] now peter said we don't have money but
[51:28] what he's saying just look on us
[51:32] yeah just just look on us and that's
[51:34] what you need to know amen
[51:36] amen do you know you're the life to this
[51:38] dying generation

[51:41] left on this earth

[51:45] written was uh the zodiac
[51:46] that's right amen the second bible uh
[51:49] the
[51:50] pyramid i think that's right amen and
[51:52] the third bible
[51:53] is what you got on your lap or your hand
[51:55] or on your phone or whatever amen
[51:57] but the prophet that god said a lot of
[51:59] people don't read their bible
[52:01] but what they will read they will read
[52:02] you
[52:06] so you are the written epistles
[52:09] and read of all men so we the one

[1:31:00] the dog yeah you got the dog you you got
[1:31:02] the dog

[1:31:06] he was talking all that knowing
[1:31:08] but somebody called the the cops and
[1:31:10] when the cops coming there when in bad
[1:31:12] the same man you thought he got saved
[1:31:19] huh he thought he got to say he calmed

[1:31:40] well the devil don't like that kind of
[1:31:42] preaching huh christian don't die they
[1:31:43] go to another dimension amen
[1:31:45] brother brown said what is age anymore
[1:31:47] anyhow amen
[1:31:48] so brother brown know how to use the
[1:31:51] word on the devil
[1:31:52] y'all making me feel like preaching that
[1:31:53] someone if you got a dick in here you
[1:31:55] got to tell me if i'm going over my time
[1:31:58] i mean if i'm preaching too long just
[1:31:59] kind of wave your hand
[1:32:02] but i mean you're gonna have to wave it
[1:32:04] fast but if you do like that
[1:32:05] i think you worship and i'm gonna keep
[1:32:07] on preaching
[1:32:09] oh praise god amen amen but brother
[1:32:12] brethren knew how to use the word
[1:32:14] amen you remember brother elvis evans
[1:32:17] i think his name he's from uh georgia
[1:32:20] right
[1:32:21] came to louisville right and brother
[1:32:23] brown said he traveled for so many miles
[1:32:25] but what happened was brother elvin
[1:32:27] forgot to leave his car outside
[1:32:30] and somebody stole his car and brother
[1:32:32] brown said in that town they'll steal
[1:32:34] your car
[1:32:35] they could change the license plate give
[1:32:36] you any numbers just like that
[1:32:38] he said that's what they do in
[1:32:39] louisville they're still cars
[1:32:41] so but what they did they went to the
[1:32:44] right man
[1:32:44] that's why you need to know somebody
[1:32:46] that know how to get a hold of god
[1:32:49] yeah we're living the hour now you need
[1:32:51] to know somebody
[1:32:52] say i'll be careful who i talk to
[1:32:54] because some people they love the gospel
[1:32:56] all the time
[1:32:57] they always you know how they act
[1:33:00] when you come around if you want to talk
[1:33:02] about somebody like they be scratching
[1:33:04] their son
[1:33:05] like wait what wait and they want to
[1:33:06] talk about something you
[1:33:08] you see that sister and you you i don't
[1:33:10] want to hear that
[1:33:12] i don't want to hear that give me
[1:33:13] something with some life in it huh
[1:33:16] give me something with some joy in it
[1:33:18] praise god amen
[1:33:19] so brother brown they came to brother
[1:33:21] brown and said brother brian
[1:33:23] my car is gone my wife baloney
[1:33:26] and this man a long way from home boy
[1:33:29] it's something about desperation
[1:33:31] brother brown said it's sad people got
[1:33:32] to get desperate for god to move
[1:33:35] if you get desperate enough the rapture
[1:33:37] will take place
[1:33:38] people in desperate people love these
[1:33:40] things of this world
[1:33:41] and they went to brother branham and
[1:33:43] brother brown would say brother let's
[1:33:45] pray
[1:33:46] now brother brown would say let's go to
[1:33:47] our knees he said now jesus didn't have
[1:33:49] to do that
[1:33:50] because the only thing he did was spoke
[1:33:51] the word jesus come down and hit the
[1:33:53] offer
[1:33:54] we bypass out the offer and come on this
[1:33:57] earth
[1:33:57] in this sinful tabernacle how and now we
[1:34:00] got to have
[1:34:01] faith to believe in god's promised word
[1:34:04] so when you pray
[1:34:05] you got to enforce it
[1:34:08] now i preached this at a church about a
[1:34:10] month ago i'm going to tell you what
[1:34:11] happened
[1:34:12] somebody caught that revelation and when
[1:34:14] i said
[1:34:15] i said and brother brown said let's pray
[1:34:17] and he said me and my four or five
[1:34:19] brother
[1:34:20] got down and we prayed prayer is the
[1:34:22] most powerful weapon
[1:34:23] that was ever placed in the hands of a
[1:34:26] human being but people don't want to
[1:34:28] pray
[1:34:28] you want to tell the devil amen
[1:34:30] sometimes you got to pray
[1:34:33] you got to pray over your situation and
[1:34:35] brother brown said let's pray
[1:34:37] and when they began to pray brother
[1:34:39] brown said a vision wait a minute a
[1:34:40] vision it just broke forth he said i see
[1:34:42] your car
[1:34:43] they brought it on this side of the
[1:34:45] bridge or something like he said they
[1:34:46] brought it back
[1:34:47] and his brother brandon told them where
[1:34:48] it was at and they went over there and
[1:34:50] they found the car i think it was kind
[1:34:52] of half tank of gaza that's right y'all
[1:34:54] help me out you messy believers
[1:34:55] hey man don't let me go go the wrong way
[1:34:57] man cause somebody listen he ain't quote
[1:34:59] that right
[1:35:02] brother brown said seven thousand
[1:35:04] instead of seven hundred is that right
[1:35:06] so he is human but brother brown prayed
[1:35:10] and he used the word and he enforced the
[1:35:13] law
[1:35:14] and that camp uh praise god that car
[1:35:18] came back well i was preaching at that
[1:35:20] church that that
[1:35:21] a few senses ago and i spoke the same
[1:35:24] message
[1:35:25] and it was the same anointing that is
[1:35:26] here because i told the people
[1:35:28] the same power that was in william
[1:35:30] bradley is here today
[1:35:32] no this is this power we talk about it's
[1:35:35] not in jeffersonville
[1:35:37] no no not ever the same holy ghost power
[1:35:41] is in here but you got to know how to
[1:35:42] release that you got to know how to let
[1:35:44] it go
[1:35:46] yeah use a bird you know how to fly

[1:35:50] bird do
[1:35:51] this they fly a fish don't come and say
