brother Daniel asked us to read chapter 15. and right at the beginning those who still wanted the law were trying to force the law back on the Believers so we'll read those verses then said he lo I come to do thy will o God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second by the which we are all which we are Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all and every priest had this daily ministering often offering oftentimes the same sacrifice which can never take away the sins this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he has perfected forever them that are Sanctified where of the Holy Ghost is also is a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the Covenant that I will make with him after those days saith Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquity iniquities will I remember no more now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus so what a promise and he kept keeps his word amen for it reaches to the highest mountain and it flows to the lowest Valley wherever you are whatever state you are it will reach you there oh foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] always values [Music] it will never lose one more time sister hope if you'll be ready for Adventures to the highest mountain and it flows [Music] amen amen the Green family asked us to please say thank you to the church for all that they did and all that part did and watched and the cards have been sent and things they appreciated very much so we know how much that family means to us but we can in turn pay back some of that favor just so they wanted just to be sure that we thank the congregation [Music] tears will never stay on the streets of that City [Music] of pain or death on my mind teardrops [Music] drops aren't welcome [Music] memories [Music] on my mind [Music] teardrops aren't welcome beyond the gates hurry for the heart will

let's sing the the chorus o love of God it will stand and the verse if we would think the ocean film and we're the Skies of parchment made [Music] Let's do let's start with that for that verse could

[Music] I'll measure [Music] strong it shall forever foreign and then the words of that song As We Know there's the main verse of that it was found written on the walls of an insane Institution many years ago they don't know who the author is but they know that whoever that was was certainly inspired to write those words let's pray Lord God we thank you for another opportunity to come together to worship father to sing to to Father get into your word and understand it better I pray Lord that you'd be with us tonight father God my words is I read the words of this book of Acts I pray that The Same Spirit father same anointing that was on the author would be on here at the pulpit tonight the father that you anoint my words and anoint the ears of the year be with us Lord we pray we love you in Jesus name amen God bless you you can take your seats um again thanks to uh brother Aaron he mentioned that to thank you for the kindness from the Green family um what a nice it was a nice funeral it was uh I thought it was I thought it was interesting that uh sister green always said that she wanted to sing at her own funeral so as as it would have it they they played at the end of service they played a recording of Sister Green singing and I don't know if you noticed but there was a big picture window in the back of the funeral home where the service was and when sister green as soon as she finished singing this giant plane comes down over the Catalina mountains and and dumps this big red slurry fire up on top of the mountain and I thought what a perfect did anybody else see that wasn't that it wasn't that great it was it was and it was right at the end of her song and it came down and I just felt like the Lord turned the mountain red just representing the blood of Jesus Christ and how sister green me she may have gone and brother green may have gone and many of our loved ones may have gone but because of that red blood of Jesus Christ we have the opportunity to see them again one day that that just blessed me when I saw that come down I thought it was a fitting end um after the after the service we had a group pretty much the whole congregation I think that was there came over to the fellowship hall and we had a really nice time a fellowship and I am wild people were fellowshipping I am noticed some people coming in to the door here obviously everyone was out there in the fellowship hall and I noticed some people coming in to the door and I wondered okay what's going on in the sanctuary so I walked in and I saw some of the some of the kids and there was a lot of the family there and I think the the legalist part of me came out a little bit and and I told I told one of the the brothers that was there that was his kids I said I said hey I said I said don't let the kids um be running around the fellowship hall and I was I think I was a little bit I was a little bit too firm I was a little bit too sharp and if any of you know me I know some of the brothers know me that sometimes I can get that way a little bit where I'm just I'm too pointed and when when I did that I could feel that I offended the brother a little bit and uh he was very respectful and he he and his wife gathered up the kids and they they went out in the into the um Fellowship Hall and I wasn't kicking them out I just I wanted control in the sanctuary but like I said I think it came across too strongly and I could feel that I I grieved maybe grieved the spirit a little bit and I I may have offended the brother so and then if you know me you know that I can't think of anything when I've done that I can't think of anything until I want to make it right so finally I tracked him down I went looking for him actually I went outside I was trying to find him right after he left I walked out and I couldn't find him outside I couldn't find him inside I thought man I really messed this one out so but after 30 minutes or so I found it and I walked up to him and I said Hey brother I said I didn't mean to be so so sharp when I said that about the kids I said I just walked in and and um I saw the kids in the in the fellowship hall and I just wanted things to be I just want to keep this holy and quiet in here and he was he was visibly upset about it so we started talking and and I said brother just forgive me for the way that I came across so that's when I said hey why don't you gather up all of your kids all of these these young people and I said let's go upstairs and I'll show you our new room up there and let them play and enjoy themselves so I convinced him to come up and and we went up there and I tried to break the ice a little bit more and uh he said do you still have that Chapel up there Steve do you still do Sunday school up there I said yeah let's go let's go across the hallway so we left the family and the kids up in the upper room and then we walked across the hallway into the chapel and had a conversation with him and uh I said I said again brother I said I'm sorry about this I said I I sometimes I I get a little legalistic in in my life I said but I didn't mean it that way and he said he says you know he said it's okay and he was very very nice to me said it's okay he says he says you know he says I grew up my family grew up here my grandpa brother green was the pastor and and he said you know I just I just wanted the kids to see and I said brother I said I feel terrible and and we talked a little bit more and he said you know he said I have the table on my phone he said I listened to brother Branham a lot he said I love his message and he said but you know he says I think that sometimes what these these ministers teach what these pastors teach isn't what brother Branham taught and I said well brother I think now you're preaching my message and he says he says well he says he says it's true he says that they teach all of these different doctrines and he says I listen to these tapes and he says I don't see what they're teaching here and we had a really nice conversation so as always I think the Lord can take our failures and then he can turn them around and make it a blessing so it was really nice meeting him is very very nice brother it's Andrew is his name you probably all know him I didn't know him Andrew Green but a very very nice brother and just really impressed me impressed me in his knowledge of the word and of the scriptures he's very active in his church and if you were at the funeral wow can he sing amazing voice very very talented talented brother so we had this conversation and and as I was praying about it yesterday evening and this morning I got to thinking you know what this is exactly what I'm going to teach on on Wednesday night that's exactly what I'm going to teach on tonight is Acts chapter 15 and it's the same principles as what happened in the church yesterday with me and it's the same principles as what this brother was telling me that he was struggling with so let's turn to act let's start with Acts Chapter 14 verse 26 so so we can get an idea of what's going on here so this is Paul for those of of uh of you that uh Cynthia God bless you it's it's good to see you see your brother Joe it's good to see you Cynthia thanks thanks for coming what we're doing is we're teaching on the book of Acts we started weeks and weeks ago and and uh we we've gone through how the day at Pentecost how they received the Holy Spirit all the way up until now this Acts chapter 15 and what's happened is we see that Jesus died he rose up from the dead he promised that he was going to send his Spirit upon his disciples and he leaves he ascends up into heaven and he sends his holy spirit down to the disciples in what was called the day of Pentecost then they started doing the exact same thing that Jesus did when he was here so you look at the gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John you see everything that Jesus did during that time now you see the book of Acts and the the disciples are now doing what Jesus did previously in the in the four gospels so that's what the book of Acts is it's basically Jesus A continuing continuation of Jesus's Ministry in now not in Jesus but in the disciples so the spirit of Jesus in the disciples there you have the book of Acts in short so now we're in chapter 15 where we're going to start in 14. So what had happened is they had just gone on their first missionary trip and they came back Paul and this man named Barnabas and then they sailed to Antioch from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled and when they were come they had gathered the church together they rehearsed all that God had done with them and how he had opened the door of Faith unto the Gentiles and there they Abode long time with the disciples now right here we have two different groups of people for those just getting started in the book of Acts we have the Hebrews who for thousands of years have been considered God's people and we have this other group these new Believers that the Hebrews kind of shunned for all these years but now things are changing and God wants these Jews to start accepting these new believers and that's when we see the message starting to go to the Gentiles chapter 15. verse 1. so they had come back to Antioch and certain men which came down from Judea taught the Brethren and said except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses you cannot be saved so we have Paul and and Barnabas and the brothers they're going out and they're spreading the gospel they're doing Miracles they're doing doing all these things and they come back home come back to their home base in Antioch and then they see that while they were gone these people had come from Judea probably from Jerusalem they came and they started telling the people these new converts that unless you're circumcised which is from the law of Moses you can't be saved now you think well circumcision back then how important was that well let's turn to Genesis chapter 17 first circumcision was a covenant that God made between him and his prophet Abraham Genesis chapter 17 verse 10. now let me show you how important that this Covenant was this is my Covenant God speaking this is my Covenant which you shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised and ye shall circumcise the Flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token of the Covenant betwixt me and you and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you every man child in your Generations he that is born in the house or brought or bought with money of any stranger which is not of thy seed so anyone that you even a slave or anyone a prosely anyone that you bring into the fold also has to be circumcised not only your children and ye shall circumcise let's see which is not of thy seed he that is born in thy house and he that is bought with thy money must needs be circumcised and my Covenant shall be in your flesh for an Everlasting Covenant and the uncircumcised Man Child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that Soul shall be cut off from his people he has broken my Covenant powerful powerful statement that God gives to his prophet and this statement this Covenant between man and God went on for thousands of years so now these two brothers come down from Judea the church at Jerusalem probably they come down and they come down to this group of Greek speaking Jews and Gentiles all mixed together in Antioch and while Paul is gone they start preaching hey you're wrong here is what the prophet said you need to be circumcised according to this word now I want all of us to think where would you have been on the side of this argument before I read the next verse where would you have been where would I have been uh in this argument think about it would I stand with the prophet Abraham would I stand with the prophet Moses who brought these laws or this guy Paul where did he come from you know number one he was persecuting the Christians now all of a sudden he's he's this big guy and he's going out and he's preaching Jesus to all these people and and who is he to say that this isn't important very very put yourself in the spot where would you stand brother and where would I stand and this happens all the time this type of thing by the way before I get to the next verse how many times do you see someone come into a church there was a two brothers from Canada you probably know him um I know him fairly well they uh they came and they made their rounds in the United States did they come here they did okay their buddies of mine I know anyways for those of you you don't know what I'm talking about what they would do is they would come into a church and they would start heckling the women saying oh your your hair is your your skirts not long enough your heels are too high you're and they find everything that they could find wrong with the women and with the men and I sat across from these brothers discussing this and I was like brothers where are you getting all of this and they would go and they'd take one quote over here and one quote over here and they put it together and they'd make this Doctrine and then they would go from church to church heckling people and causing problems and just wanting basically to pull the people away from their Church many of us are familiar with these two brothers but there's also that Spirit isn't just in the extreme like those two brothers but that spirit is all over the place and we see that this is what happened in this church and these people these two brothers were probably very respected Brothers they obviously knew the word well and they came in and what they did is they caused trouble now remember Paul was going through do you remember the area he was going through from the previous galatia so if you look in the book of Galatians Paul addresses this I believe it's in Galatians chapter one and he calls them troublemakers referring to these brothers right here verse number two when therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them they were preaching circumcision exactly what is in the Bible given to Abraham preached by Moses one of the laws preaching these things there's no small dissension and disputation with them they determined now this is the group at Antioch they determined this caused a problem it's like well we need some answers here that Paul and bartimus and certain other of them should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and Elders about this question so it's like Paul and Barnabas we love you but we need an answer maybe from the ones that were so respected like maybe Peter maybe John these ones maybe James these ones that walked with Jesus Paul all right we'll go so we have to realize that when Paul was was telling these Brethren like no you don't have to be circumcised you don't have to you don't have to go through all of these laws and all of this stuff Paul was not preaching against the law Paul was not saying that the law is wrong if you look Beyond this chapter you see that Paul very much his whole life honored the Jewish principles and the Jewish traditions and the Jewish law he never varied from it we see later on that brother Lyle or I one of us will get to that Paul wanted to get back to Jerusalem to honor the feast day to be there so he can observe this this Feast this Jewish tradition that I guarantee you Paul still believed that was right but with these new converts he says no he says you don't have to do this so whose side would I have been on at this at this moment I mentioned the legalism nature sometimes that I have I think Brother Andy I think I know where I would have been in this specific place I think I may have been on the wrong side but thank God we have this word recorded here and being brought on their way by the church they passed through phenicia and Samaria declaring the conversion of the Gentiles and they cause great joy unto all the Brethren so they stopped in these these different spots and everyone rejoiced that they had so many conversions and so many baptism and the Lord was was doing so much and the church was growing and everyone was just rejoicing and then they came to Jerusalem and when they were come to Jerusalem they were received of the church and of the Apostles and elders and they declared all things that God had done with them but there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed very very important part of that scripture these are not the Pharisees like you think that crucified Jesus these are the Pharisees these are the ministers that had given their hearts to Jesus Christ these are the ones that have they were they were ministers before they saw that this man Christ this man Peter this man John this man James these brothers are right in their Doctrine this man Jesus fulfills the the Prophecies of this Messiah so these are real Believers Minister brethren and they said that it was needful to them it was needful to circumcise them these are the new believers and to command them to keep the law of Moses now of course these Pharisees believe in grace you can't believe in Jesus and not believe in grace you can't believe in Christ and not accept the sacrifice that Jesus made for us so these Pharisees knew but they were they were caught up in in their traditions and their way of thinking and the apostles and Elders came together for to consider of this matter and when there had been much disputing so they had all the brothers together maybe in the church now this is the church this is the First Christian Church in the whole world that they're at in Jerusalem thousands probably a people that were members of this church and when they had been much disputing Peter rose up and said unto them men and Brethren now remember Peter is a very respected man and brethren you know how that a good while ago God made a choice Among Us that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel and believe now do you know what he was referring to you guys remember what was it what was the man's name Cornelius right so what happened in this he's referring to a couple chapters back I think it was Acts 10. he was referring to when this man Cornelius an angel comes and visits this this uh I believe he's a centurionist soldier Cornelius and tells him that this man Peter has the truth for him and to send people to go get Peter and to bring him back Peter was up on the housetop praying Peter sees a vision down comes all of these unclean animals that Peter would never eat as a Jew they were against the law to eat them you know what they are can anybody say I want any of them are what a pig a pig because it doesn't chew its cup it's cud but it has a cloven hoof you can eat it if it has a cloven hoof and choose its cut fish rabbits because it chews its cut and doesn't have a cloven hoof uh there's a bunch of them that you can't eat so all of these come down and Peter is hungry and the Lord tells him rise up Peter he says kill these animals and eat them and Peter's like not me because I'm a Jew I don't I don't need anything like that um I'm kosher and uh then the Lord tells him why have you made unclean what I have made clean so Peter it's like wow what then there's a knock at the door and there is this Gentile saying come to my Master's house and tell us about the Lord so Peter goes and he goes to the cornelius's house he preaches Jesus Christ they accept him and we see a conversion of a gentile right here so that's what he's referring to here when he says by my mouth the first one should hear the word of the gospel and believe and God which knoweth the hearts bear them witness giving them the Holy Ghost even as he did unto us and put no difference between us and Them purifying their hearts by faith amazing so he's saying that God filled these unclean they used to call them heathens these these people that didn't believe the message before they come in and those that have believed their whole lives and have lived the message and done their best and lived lived a life Worthy the Holy Spirit does the same thing to both of them you have somebody that knows nothing about the message then you have somebody that knows everything about the message and wow they received the same thing it's amazing he's saying that God is Not exclusive to any denomination or any group as long as there's Jesus Christ there now therefore why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear now remember there's a difference as I said right when we started this series I said that there's a difference between a disciple and an apostle an apostle would be one that sent out to spread the gospel a disciple is one that has received the gospel and now believes Jesus Christ so we are all disciples I'm a disciple you're a disciple all of us are Disciples of Christ let me read that again now therefore why tempt you God to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear so he's saying that these people have have accepted Christ but now you're saying that they have to live up to all these Commandments I'm not talking about just the ten there's like 600 more in Leviticus and and and exodus and Deuteronomy there there's all of these Commandments literally it's over 600. and they take these and then they twist them and they they they they fight over how they're supposed to be implemented and all this and you get this big conglomeration this big mess of a religion and all it is is about legalism it's washing dishes a certain way special diet sacrificing in a certain way special clothing with tassels woven in a certain way not eating as as we said catfish and pork and rabbits and and I don't want to get too too far into it but not having a television not watching movies I hear a certain length choose a certain size skirts a certain League Church three times a week all of these different these different um ordinances and he's saying here Peter's saying but you still sinned but you still have failed he's not saying that any of those things are wrong he's not saying that that Holiness is wrong by any means he's not saying that but he's saying but it was incomplete without the blood of Christ I think it's in the I think it's in uh I forgot where it was in Romans I think it is he says he talks about the grace of God and he says but then do I sin that Grace May abound he says God forbid I won't do that yet because when we see that Peter is saying that this failed and he says you weren't even able to live up to this he says your ancestors were your parents weren't your grandparents were all the way back to Adam you weren't able to live up to these to these ordinances and now you want to place it place this on these people and you want to make them live up to this when you couldn't do it talking about these men that came in there to galatia to Antioch and what good did it do you know what good and I I look at look at my life and I I think about and I still I still do my best to live a very legalistic life I do my best to toe the line you know and I know sometimes I don't talk like it but I haven't had a TV in decades you know I don't go to see movies I don't do I don't do any of those things but what good that's just me doing my best to serve the Lord that's me doing my best to live a holy life before the Lord works Grace is what God did for me works are what I do for him but I look back even at my life and the way that I live just in Daniel's a witness how we lived as just as close as I could as perfect as I could to all of these different doctrines and I think what where did I ever through my doctrines through my legalism where did I ever lead someone to Christ never and very seldom has it happened and here we see that very question instead of all of these things Peter here saying salvation can't be found in anything except Christ but we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved even as they and then all the multitude kept silent and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul declaring What miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them what if this had been an intellectual gospel what if this would have just been someone who goes and they can just open the scriptures and explain it but the supernatural followed this ministry that's why I believe that we must have that Supernatural following our Ministries it needs to be there it shows that God is with us because there were miracles and there were new conversions and there were baptisms and the body was growing they received Paul and Barnabas with respect and after they had held their peace James answering said men and Brethren hearken unto me do you know who this James guy is is very very important this isn't you know you read in the gospels Peter James and John this isn't John's brother James he was killed earlier in the book of Acts this is Jesus's brother his not his real brother but Jesus's brother James his foster brother I guess we could call him James was also the pastor of the church at Jerusalem very important man but Andy I had a question for you so if James was the pastor of this church in Jerusalem he was the first pastor how could Catholicism say that Peter was the first one doesn't make sense it's a it's a flaw it's a fatal flaw saying that that this Peter was the first leader he wasn't yes he had the Keys of the Kingdom but this man James was the pastor of the church so these brothers they they weighed in on on the circumcision and the other things Paul and Peter weighed in their side now we see James and he weighs in and he had a lot of authority James says this James answered and said men and brother and hearken unto me Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles to take out of them a people for his name not for his name now Simeon in other words for Simeon is Simon Simon is actually Peter so he's quoting Peter but he's using Brother lilies Jewish name because it's directing it to a bunch of the the Jews the original Believers here and you know I just one thing it's one of the reasons I just I love I love this Bible so much I like to look at the past in the Bible the Bible it shows the purpose in a lot of these things even the language that was written in you see Matthew Mark and Luke and John and acts and Romans and first and second Corinthians all the way to Second Timothy it's written in the language of Greek not Hebrew if it was written to the Jews it would have been written in their language but it was written in a language and then the Romans and the Greeks they wouldn't have understood probably Hebrew but they spoke this language Greek so this Bible this new testament was mostly written in that language so that these new Believers would understand look at the focus look at look at the emphasis that's put on the new believers even in the very language that it was written in then if then we see the book of Hebrews and you can remember because it's named Hebrews that was written more to the Jewish people and that original language was Hebrew or Aramaic the that that language back to James back to James speaking and to disagree the words of the Prophet as it is written after this I will return and will build again the Tabernacle of David which has fallen down and I will build again the ruins thereof and I will set it up so he's referring back to the prophecy of a man named Amos a prophet that the residue of men might seek after the Lord and all the Gentiles upon whom my name is called saith the Lord who doeth all these things so he's quoting the prophets and he's saying that the prophets are not saying that they have to be converted to the Jewish message before they come to Christ he's saying that they have to be converted to Christ he's saying that there's not a step between between an a new a new person that may not know anything about Jesus and Jesus you don't have to go through Judaism brother Lyle you don't have to go through the Hebrew you don't have to go through all the laws you can just go straight to Christ there's a parable it just comes to mind there's a parable that these laborers are out in the field and they've been they've been working and they make a deal they one comes in the morning he makes a deal with with the owner of of the um the farm or whatever it was and it says I'll give you this much so they go out and work they work all day then he hires some right at noon time working half the day they come out they they go working and then right before quitting time he hires this other this other guy and then at the end he pays them all the same and he and they said well how come we worked all day and this guy gets the same pay as us and he says I gave you exactly what we agreed to and that's the same here is you don't have to go through all of these different roads to get to Christ like the Jews did you can just go straight to him so a new believer doesn't have to conform to all these things that comes later that new believer you can go straight to Christ and you're there you're already home run out of the park you made it now if you love God now you can start to implement these things in your life where am I at verse 17. I just read it I'll read it read it again that the residue of men might seek after the Lord and all the Gentiles upon whom my name is called saith the Lord who doeth all these things known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world God knows it all he knows what's going on he knows where you were born he knows where you're going to die he knows Genesis to Revelation he knows the beginning to the end now James says here now we see the authority that's in this man James were for my sentences my decision is this that we trouble not them which from among the Gentiles are turned to God he says James is saying don't trouble them don't don't trouble these new Believers with all all of these rules and and all these regulations and and all the way you eat and circumcision all that he says don't trouble them but he doesn't doesn't say us brother Paul he doesn't say that we have that that we the Jews and I'm not saying that we are but speaking back in the book of Acts he doesn't say that Paul should change he doesn't say that Peter should change he doesn't say that they should start living like the Gentiles do he says he's talking to them he's talking to the Gentiles now this is really neat but that we write unto them so he's going to write a letter and it's it's really this is really amazing because you get a letter inside of This Book of Acts so you know the Epistles that we have first and second Timothy and Titus and and uh first and second Corinthians all those we have an epistle inside the book of Acts and it says this but we write unto them that they abstain from pollutions of idols and from fornication and from things strangled and from blood so he's telling the new converts to stay away from eating things that were sacrificed to Idols in other places Paul Paul says hey don't worry about it but don't offend anyone but here James is saying that this is a really big deal to the Jewish Believers so do your best to stay away from those things and these new converts they may have been brought up by their families and with certain values that that may not have lined up now he's he's talking about things strangled and from the blood and and from um things sacrificed to Idols but then he says and stay away from fornication and some of these Greeks and these Gentiles may have been brought up that that oh it's okay to go out and run around before you're married but this was a very very important thing to tell all of the children not just the Jewish ones but all of them hey don't do this before you're married it'll cause all kinds of problems he says from things strangled again this was a pagan ritual these animals were sacrificed on Pagan altars and then they were sold for food and the same thing with the blood some of the cultures would eat blood or add blood to certain dishes and this was an offense to Jewish people so basically with the Jews everything had to be bled out before it was kosher before you could eat it so he's saying here that these things are especially offensive so don't do these things even though you might feel you might not feel condemned by it but those long time Believers that will offend them so now we have two ways going back here back and forth we see that that Paul is saying to those longtime Believers he said he's saying hey have some Grace have some patience with these people don't worry about it if they're not living up to all of these these things that that you set forth now don't you backslide he says but but respect them in the way they were raised and just don't do these certain things and then on the other side for the new Believers he's saying hey and you respect these long time Believers respect their thoughts respect how they act two there's a mutual respect in this letter written by James both sides I love that that's a Christian way you know we see so often we see the more rebellious say you can't tell me what to do we know I know that's that's not the point you know so so there's that sometimes that disrespect but then there's the disrespect of of the like our friends from Canada oh you're looking like this you see all this girl's dressed and you know all of that oh did you see this guy you know he's out there swimming in a pair of shorts you know you know and then going on that and Paul or James here is saying respect each other James continues on and he says for Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him being read in the synagogues every Sabbath day so so he's saying hey Moses is still a prophet he's still being preached in the churches that shouldn't be forgotten he has a prophet after all don't forget what he said but then we've taken that and made as I said like 600 of all of these rituals and stuff that they didn't do anything they really didn't accomplish anything so they write this letter then it pleased then well that's what James said we should write a letter that says this then it pleased then pleased at the apostles and the elders with the whole church to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas namely Judas surname barsabis and Silas Chief men among the brethren another masterful decision by James so maybe they wouldn't let's say by the end of you and me are Barnabas or Silas and or were Barnabas and Paul and we come back to the church and we're preaching the same thing that we were before they might not believe us but instead they sent two representatives from the church that people knew to go with them this man Judas of course not is cared as another man named Judas and Silas Chief men among the brethren and they wrote Letters by them after this manner the apostles and the elders and the Brethren sin greetings so here's the letter the apostles and the elders and the brother and sin greeting unto the Brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Celestia for as much as we have heard that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words so these Brethren came from this church and they said we're from the Tucson Tabernacle and our pastor says this and this and this or we come from the thing that would bug me so much is when the Brethren would come from Jeffersonville when I was back there they'd go all over the world and they say we're from Jeffersonville and here's how you should do things and and here's what brother Branham said and here's here's uh here's what brother Joseph's teaching and and all this let me tell you we can all speak for ourselves brother Branham there's 1200 tapes and they're really good if you want to know what brother Branham said listen to him you don't need me to interpret it to you it's he spoke good English spoke very understandable English if you want to hear what he said listen to him and the same goes from rep representing Brother Joseph or representing brother Biscoe or any of these other men of God let them speak for themselves they don't need us talking for them it causes problems and I've seen it so often these problems people come in they stir up the people and they'll come into a church cause all these problems the churches will split and I have all these problems because they're representing somebody else if you want to know what I'm saying listen to me go on tucsontabernacle.com I'm I'm there a couple times a week if you want to hear what brother Branham says listen to him don't take someone else's word for it because there's always an agenda there and that's why we see all of these problems that's why brother Brandon when he was preaching he said refer back to these tapes and if you'll listen to that quote he was talking about the Seven Seals if I remember right and these people are getting it mixed up and they're quoting me wrong and all just listen listen to what I say and that's why we see all these problems that's why it is so important if you want to believe William Branham listen to him as I said he spoke very clearly and that's what that brother said up upstairs he said I love listening to brother Branham it's because everybody changes it to match their own agenda I could talk about that brother Jordan all night long you know I just because I've seen so many problems the exact same thing that was happening here in the book of Acts they go and they represent someone and here is the letter that comes out and it says for as much as we have heard that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words subverting your souls saying You must be circumcised and keep the law to whom we gave no such Commandments we did not send these guys out as I said let the prophet speak for himself it's we have here in the Bible we have small small precious writings from the prophet and they're just they are golden to us we just cherish them so much and we read them and we study them and we come to church to learn more about them and the ministers they they study these things and they they they try to apply we try to apply them to our own lives but then we hear Brother Branham and we can hear him we can listen to a whole tape and and really understand what he is saying and if you want to believe him believe him you don't have to have me explain to you what he was meaning he did a very good job of it and as as brother said and I've said before I really don't believe brother Branham intended for us to have all of these different doctrines that go around the church and divide people I just I don't believe that he intended that I've listened to him since I was born and he's uh it's just a blessing every time it really it really is Sister Cynthia when I talk about brother Branham he was a man that that was here in the 40s and 50s and 60s he started a Ministry that really changed the world it was he started what's called charismatic Revival he uh he did absolutely incredible things one of the most the most gifted person that you could ever imagine he preached right here in this church he preached from this pulpit and what would happen is people would come in the prayer lines he would tell them exactly what was wrong with them if they were sick in fact many times he would say here's your address and tell tell the person their address he would say things that no one knew he was he would say this morning you went to the doctor's office and the doctor looked at you and he was wearing a blue vest and and something on his head and he's told you these things things that he absolutely could not know but the Holy Spirit was working through this man to increase the people's Faith so they could be healed and when I mentioned William Branham he he was he was very special he's the reason I'm converted he's the reason I'm a Christian today so he holds a big place in my heart verse number 25. it seemed good unto us being assembled with one Accord to send chosen men unto you this is our letter part this is the continuation of the letter chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul men that hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we have sent therefore Judas and Silas who shall also tell you the same thing by mouth for it seems seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these Necessary Things that you abstain from Meats offered to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication from which if you keep yourselves you shall do well fairly well wow very simple very very simple he's saying stay away from idols and live clean not all of these rules and all these regulations and all of that he's saying just be a Christian so when they were dismissed they came to Antioch and when they had gathered the multitude together they delivered the epistle which when they had read they rejoiced for the consolation I'll bet they did and Judas and Silas being prophets also themselves exhorted the Brethren with many words and confirmed them and after they had carried their space they were let go in peace from the Brethren unto the apostles I can finish notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still no no let me go back to that previous verse it says verse 32 verse 31 I'm sorry which when they had heard when they read this letter they rejoiced for the for the consolation so so they were happy about all this that that they didn't feel led to be circumcised even though there was a very strict rule yet the the letter came back no you don't have to do that no you don't have to do all of these all of these rules basically stay away from idols and live clean and then Silas decided to stay and the other brother went back Paul also in Barnabas continued in Antioch teaching and preaching the word of the Lord with many others also and some days after Paul said unto Barnabas let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord and see how they do now they had left Antioch for a little while and all kinds of problems came in with this these legalist Brothers came in and stirred everything up and caused all these problems so Paul's like hey we need to go back to all these churches that we visited and make sure they're doing okay make sure troublemakers hadn't gotten the middle of them too and Barnabas determined to take with them John whose surname was marked remember this guy he was the one that left in the middle of a missionary trip before upset Paul but Paul thought not good to take him with them who departed from them to pamphilia and went not with them to the work and the contention was so sharp between them that they departed asunder one from the other and so Barnabas took Mark and sailed unto Cyprus Paul chose Silas and departed being recommended by the Brethren unto the grace of God and he went through Syria and cilicia confirming the churches so we see that there was a contention the minute the um musicians can come make ready we see there was a contention between these two brethren and and they couldn't get it reconciled so they parted ways and I don't think we hear from Barnabas again the rest of the book of Acts is mainly about Paul but I want to I think the first part of Acts 16 also goes very well with 15. let me read the first three verses speaking of Paul then came he to Derby and to lystra and behold a certain disciple was there named timotheus the son of a certain woman which was a Jewish a Jewish and believed but his father was a Greek which was well speaking of Timothy which was well reported of by the Brethren that were at lystra and Iconium him would Paul have to go forth with him and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters for they knew all that his father was a Greek so Timothy didn't think it was necessary to be circumcised or he would have already been circumcised but now he gets on the field and he's going to be witnessing and preaching to Jewish believers so he had to be circumcised because they wouldn't have accepted him so we see that's why Timothy Timothy now is on the scene and we see that he took on this circumcision for the ministry not necessarily because he felt a conviction but for the people that he was preaching to we together do you understand do you understand that there was a this letter was a mutual respect this letter was written to these new converts and it was like no you don't have to conform to all of these rules just don't live immorally and don't get caught up in these idols and don't drink the blood because it's going to offend really bad that's really bad don't do those things and then he speaks to the new converts and he says Hey respect these longtime believers respect what they do and respect the way that they live because Moses taught all of this stuff so we see a beautiful mutual respect in the book of Acts brother and if you want to come you understand do you love the book of Acts I love it I love it because I see especially in this book I see that this is what we struggle with so often in our churches well someone will come in or someone within the church and start pointing fingers both sides both sides will the liberal ones and the legalistic ones start pointing fingers at each other and it does nothing but cause problems what he's saying here is respect each other don't try to impose things that never worked in the first place because it it it doesn't work it wasn't written for that it was just written as a guiding principle to keep us on the path till we get to Christ amen let's all stand through the blood through the blood through the blood we can come to his presence through Jesus Christ [Music] all through [Music] Jesus Christ awaken down [Music] for the Paul if you if you come in close by the Paul I uh I asked a young Lydia
