[38:03] you guys want to come on up let's keep
[38:07] singing that chorus there
[38:09] what a day that
[38:12] will be when my jesus
[38:20] [Music]
[38:30] see
[38:33] [Music]
[38:35] thank you
[38:47] [Music]
[38:51] it's like i want to thank the lord i
[38:52] want to give a testimony to him because
[38:54] he did something so
[38:56] great um when we moved here
[38:59] my kids they we gave them the choice
[39:02] they were
[39:02] very close to finishing college they had
[39:04] scholarships and things
[39:06] and they chose they said no we want to
[39:09] be in the house of the lord
[39:10] so they came with us and i just thank
[39:13] god because we didn't know
[39:15] i know the pastor preached um dingy
[39:18] faith i don't know if that's what you
[39:19] call it but
[39:20] we just said well we're going to apply
[39:21] it's last minute and
[39:23] we missed all the deadlines for
[39:24] everything but we're just going to apply
[39:26] and see what happens and
[39:28] long story short we just pressed and
[39:31] pressed and pressed and pressed until
[39:32] the very last moment
[39:34] and we had we couldn't do it we couldn't
[39:37] pay for it because it was out of state
[39:39] and it was triple the amount they didn't
[39:42] get any scholarships
[39:43] and so we even went as so far to
[39:46] unenroll them
[39:47] and then i called and i said to the lady
[39:50] who is in charge of the determining
[39:53] whether you're in or out of state
[39:54] and i said i'm sorry we just can't pay
[39:56] it so um
[39:58] what do we do to make sure that we can
[39:59] get in state
[40:01] for next year and she said oh you live
[40:03] here i said yes
[40:04] and she said you're all here i said yes
[40:06] she said no you qualify for in-state
[40:09] and i said well we already unenrolled
[40:11] our
[40:12] children and she said oh that's okay
[40:14] call the admissions and within like an
[40:16] hour they're back in school they have
[40:18] all their classes
[40:20] everything is taken care of everything
[40:21] is paid for and what it taught me
[40:25] in my heart because when we unenrolled i
[40:27] was really sad but i was really happy
[40:29] because
[40:30] i proved to the lord that we don't
[40:32] worship education
[40:34] we're trusting in god and i think you
[40:35] know press education college college you
[40:37] know get a good job like that's
[40:39] really a in our society that's a very
[40:42] big focus
[40:42] and for my kids they work so hard but in
[40:45] their world that is their future they
[40:47] did give up
[40:48] everything that to them that was their
[40:50] everything so
[40:52] um i just thank god the whole like i was
[40:54] really sad for them but i was happy
[40:56] that god proved our hearts but in the
[40:58] same time i
[40:59] was like god i just really believe that
[41:01] you could you taking care of everything
[41:03] just the testimony would be too large to
[41:06] tell
[41:06] but it's like you did i really believed
[41:09] you could do this like
[41:10] i just knew it and i woke up with the
[41:12] same feeling i just really
[41:13] believed you were gonna take care of
[41:15] this somehow i don't know but
[41:17] um so i think god because he is a
[41:20] restorer
[41:21] no matter what you think you're giving
[41:24] up for god and
[41:25] you don't know what's going to happen
[41:26] he's you you don't know just trust him
[41:28] because he's going to restore
[41:30] and then some so i thank god
[41:35] [Applause]
[41:41] [Music]
[41:44] you may ask me why
[41:49] [Music]
[42:00] is

[50:24] and there's approximately i counted up
[50:27] today about 10 of my
[50:28] cousins uncles and aunts that are either
[50:31] in the hospital
[50:33] or are suffering uh quite sick from the
[50:37] these would be my mom's sisters my mom's
[50:39] brothers
[50:41] my uncle john uncle robert the doctors
[50:43] have given up on them and said there's
[50:45] there's no hope for them and one of
[50:48] brother robert chacon's brother and two
[50:50] sisters one of the brothers was taken in
[50:52] in a coma to the hospital and it's it's
[50:55] we need
[50:56] god you know i can't do this alone
[51:00] i could completely cover myself protect
[51:02] myself lock myself in the room never go
[51:05] out
[51:06] but we need god so you have a need today
[51:11] if you'll stand with me does god still
[51:14] move
[51:15] is he the same yesterday today and
[51:16] forever
[51:19] do you know that personally if you don't
[51:22] ask
[51:22] him say lord would you would you be that
[51:24] to me personally
[51:26] show me that you're mindful and you know
[51:29] sometimes we get
[51:30] thinking well brother so-and-so because
[51:33] he's a brother and he's such a christian
[51:35] and sister said well she's holy so god
[51:37] hears her
[51:38] no god hears the meekest the quietest
[51:41] the lowest the down the down-hearted the
[51:43] broken
[51:45] the very one in sin remember he's
[51:47] walking with his disciples towards
[51:49] samaria
[51:50] and he said i must go this way
[51:54] and when you think about it there was
[51:55] that woman at the well
[51:57] the woman at the wheel and i was
[51:59] listening to a brother speak about that
[52:01] and
[52:01] just put in a little different
[52:02] perspective
[52:04] so she came to the well at the time that
[52:07] she had to come
[52:08] because she couldn't come with the other
[52:10] ones
[52:12] because of of her lifestyle and he said
[52:15] i wondered what she thought of those
[52:18] who forced her to come at a late time
[52:20] she probably had not didn't have good
[52:21] thoughts about them
[52:23] they were mean to her they talked about
[52:25] her
[52:27] but she gets there at the time and god
[52:28] knows that he meets her
[52:30] at the well in her condition
[52:34] i've always thought the disciples he
[52:36] told them you go over and you get some
[52:37] food
[52:38] and i've always said i wonder if he did
[52:40] that on purpose
[52:42] because they wouldn't understood either
[52:44] they would have been saying does he know
[52:46] who he's talking to does he know her
[52:48] reputation
[52:50] and i believe brother branham says in
[52:51] one of the quotes he said the disciples
[52:53] were watching from the back and they
[52:54] were thinking that already
[52:57] but he said i know why i'm going over
[52:59] there i've got to go meet one of mine
[53:02] and then this same one runs to the city
[53:04] and says co
[53:06] come see this and let's just believe
[53:09] that lord as we come to you we raise our
[53:10] hands
[53:12] we open our hearts before you today lord
[53:14] saying
[53:15] i have need of you lord without you i am
[53:17] nothing without you i can do nothing
[53:19] lord
[53:20] we're not trusting on our own goodness
[53:22] our own righteousness
[53:23] but we're trusting to the shed blood
[53:26] that perfect sacrifice
[53:28] on calvary the accepted one for us lord
[53:31] works coming that way lord and we're
[53:33] asking for that
[53:34] rivers of living water lord that you
[53:36] promised lord that we'll never thirst
[53:38] again
[53:39] our sister betty gleidwell they're in
[53:41] the hospital or would you come lord in
[53:43] the sweetness of your spirit and just
[53:45] take her heart or bloodsh pressure and
[53:47] make them normal
[53:48] any nervousness any anxiousness lord
[53:51] maybe the thoughts going through her
[53:53] mind wondering and all lord would you
[53:55] just be that peace in our heart right
[53:56] now i ask the lord
[53:58] and every need lord that is represented
[54:00] here lord and our brothers and sisters
[54:02] and
[54:03] of every nation kindred tribe tongue in
[54:05] people lord

[54:10] our only source of help today lord
[54:12] we ask it and we thank you in jesus
[54:14] christ's name
[54:15] amen amen do you love him today amen
[54:19] i appreciate the goodness of the lord
[54:21] you may be seated i spoke with brother
[54:24] matt

[57:32] things that he's brought us through and
[57:34] not only the things in the past but the
[57:36] things that he's doing right now

[58:03] you know yeah praise the lord
[58:09] yeah you know everybody within the body
[58:12] has a purpose
[58:13] and uh and here we have these these
[58:15] young people here and
[58:17] and they have gifts in their lives and
[58:18] here they are they're using their gifts
[58:20] for the glory of god
[58:22] they could be using their gifts for many
[58:24] other things and many other places but
[58:26] here they are in the house of the lord
[58:28] and using the gift that god has given
[58:30] them
[58:31] for the glory of god amen if you have
[58:34] your bibles turn with me to the book of
[58:35] deuteronomy chapter 8
[58:37] and we'll read verses 1 through 6.
[58:42] we just greet you all this morning in
[58:45] the precious name of jesus christ and
[58:47] and it's good to be in fellowship one
[58:50] with another
[58:51] and we bring greetings from our pastor
[58:53] brother ron peterson there
[58:55] evening light fellowship in phoenix and
[58:58] uh
[58:58] he just always tells me make sure and
[59:00] send your greetings with the people so
[59:03] praise the lord deuteronomy chapter 8
[59:05] and verse 1
[59:07] and it says all the commandments which i
[59:09] command thee this day
[59:11] shall ye observe to do so god gives
[59:14] commandments
[59:15] not just that it would go in one ear and
[59:18] out the other ear
[59:19] but that you would observe them and do
[59:21] those things
[59:23] that ye may live and multiply
[59:26] and go in and possess the land which the
[59:28] lord swear unto your fathers
[59:31] and thou shalt remember all the way
[59:33] which the lord thy god led thee these 40
[59:35] years in the wilderness
[59:37] now notice when god does something
[59:39] there's always a purpose behind it
[59:42] god never does anything without there
[59:44] being a purpose
[59:45] and a reason for it
[59:48] he says and the reason was to humble
[59:51] thee
[59:52] and to prove thee and to know what was
[59:54] in thine heart
[59:56] whether thou wouldest keep his
[59:57] commandments
[59:59] are no sometimes we don't realize
[1:00:02] really what's in our heart until we're
[1:00:05] tested and tried
[1:00:06] and when our back is against the wall
[1:00:09] that's when we realize
[1:00:10] what's within within us
[1:00:14] but it takes the pressure it takes our
[1:00:16] back to be against the wall
[1:00:18] and it's not for god to know what was in
[1:00:20] our heart
[1:00:21] because god already knows what's in our
[1:00:23] hearts but it's for us to realize
[1:00:25] what is in our hearts and for us to
[1:00:27] realize where
[1:00:28] we are standing in this walk of faith
[1:00:31] amen
[1:00:33] and he humbled thee and suffered thee to
[1:00:36] hunger
[1:00:37] and fed thee with manna which thou
[1:00:39] knewest not
[1:00:41] neither did thy fathers know that he
[1:00:43] might make thee
[1:00:44] know that man does not live by bread
[1:00:47] only
[1:00:48] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[1:00:50] the mouth of the lord doth man live
[1:00:52] amen thy arraignment wax not
[1:00:56] old upon thee neither did thy foot swell
[1:00:59] these 40 years us young people we don't
[1:01:02] uh
[1:01:03] understand that scripture so much but
[1:01:05] perhaps some of the
[1:01:07] the the more aged and the wise ones that
[1:01:10] are amongst us they can say yeah i
[1:01:12] understand that all right
[1:01:17] verse 5 thou shalt also consider in
[1:01:21] thine heart that as a man
[1:01:23] chasteneth his son so the lord thy god
[1:01:26] chasteneth thee therefore thou shalt
[1:01:29] keep the commandments of the lord thy
[1:01:31] god
[1:01:31] to walk in his ways and to fear him
[1:01:34] let's just pray
[1:01:35] father we have read your word and we
[1:01:38] know that your word says that
[1:01:40] the letter killeth but the spirit
[1:01:44] giveth life father we pray this morning
[1:01:47] that as we have read the letter we ask
[1:01:49] that it would be mixed with the spirit
[1:01:52] that it would be anointed by the spirit
[1:01:54] father that our hearts would receive by
[1:01:56] faith that we could receive
[1:01:58] something from you lord that would
[1:02:00] encourage us that would help us that
[1:02:02] would
[1:02:03] uplift those who are discouraged lord
[1:02:05] and
[1:02:06] perhaps if need be lord that there would
[1:02:08] be a
[1:02:09] chastening lord father god that we would
[1:02:12] know that we are children of god
[1:02:14] for we know your word says that those
[1:02:16] who you love
[1:02:18] you rebuke and you chasten
[1:02:21] we ask you bless the reading of the word
[1:02:23] to our hearts
[1:02:24] we just place this service into your
[1:02:27] hands lord
[1:02:28] for thy kingdom's glory in the name of
[1:02:30] jesus christ
[1:02:31] amen amen you may take your seats
[1:02:38] so i'd like to title this thought
[1:02:43] that i got here this morning and the
[1:02:45] title is desert places
[1:02:48] desert places now we here in
[1:02:51] arizona we are very familiar with the
[1:02:54] desert
[1:02:55] it's a hot dry extremely
[1:02:59] uncomfortable place to live in and you
[1:03:02] know
[1:03:03] from the outside looking in you would
[1:03:05] say this kind of climate and this kind
[1:03:07] of environment and this kind of heat and
[1:03:09] this kind of atmosphere was only made
[1:03:11] for
[1:03:12] one thing and and that's lizards and
[1:03:14] snakes
[1:03:15] this kind of place man i don't think
[1:03:18] that god made it for human beings to
[1:03:20] live in
[1:03:21] but he sure did you know you often think
[1:03:25] what would we do
[1:03:26] without air conditioning you know people
[1:03:30] lived here for many many years without
[1:03:31] air conditioning it just makes you
[1:03:33] wonder how they did it huh
[1:03:35] they really knew no different it was
[1:03:37] just part of life just something that
[1:03:39] they put up with but i'm thankful that i
[1:03:41] do not live in those times
[1:03:43] and it's a place where lizards and
[1:03:46] snakes you would imagine are the only
[1:03:49] things that would survive in
[1:03:51] in a desert place and it's a place where
[1:03:54] the cactus typically
[1:03:56] is the largest tree that's standing tall
[1:04:00] in the sermon planting the vine and
[1:04:02] where to plant it 1959
[1:04:05] brother branham says thus it is with the
[1:04:08] church today
[1:04:09] that when the church gets away from the
[1:04:11] fountain of life
[1:04:13] when it gets away from the joys of
[1:04:15] salvation
[1:04:17] when it gets away from the lord god then
[1:04:20] that person becomes a sticker
[1:04:22] always finding fault sticking no sooner
[1:04:26] you come up on presbyterian i'm a
[1:04:28] methodist i'm so and so
[1:04:29] don't talk to me about that stuff a
[1:04:31] sticker
[1:04:33] it has no fruits
[1:04:37] they've gotten away from the joys of the
[1:04:39] lord they've gotten away from
[1:04:41] the goodness of salvation they've
[1:04:43] they've gotten away from the
[1:04:45] fountain of life and they're they they
[1:04:47] they haven't been walking like they
[1:04:49] should and when brother branham says
[1:04:51] what do they become
[1:04:52] they become a sticker you ever seen a
[1:04:55] cactus out there
[1:04:57] stickers they're full of stickers
[1:05:00] have you ever stood on a cactus before
[1:05:05] have you ever tried to touch a cactus
[1:05:07] before you realize
[1:05:08] what a sticker is and you realize what
[1:05:11] it does to somebody
[1:05:14] i remember one time my daughter
[1:05:17] as a couple of years back maybe two
[1:05:19] years ago
[1:05:20] and uh she had been four years of aged
[1:05:22] in and we were at
[1:05:24] our cousin's house and so it's dark
[1:05:26] outside and they they live in the
[1:05:28] outskirts of phoenix and
[1:05:30] we was getting some wood and stuff to
[1:05:32] make a fire with we had a little bonfire
[1:05:35] so we're out there and first of all we
[1:05:37] have no head lamps on and
[1:05:38] and we're out and she she's daddy's
[1:05:40] little helper you know
[1:05:42] and so everywhere i go she wants to come
[1:05:44] with me and help me
[1:05:45] and um so we're out there anyways and
[1:05:47] we're picking up firewood and
[1:05:49] and all i hear is this almighty scream
[1:05:53] and
[1:05:53] you know and i turn around mariah you
[1:05:55] know what's the matter what's going on
[1:05:57] and
[1:05:58] she didn't see the cactus and so she
[1:06:01] ended up giving a cactus a good big old
[1:06:03] hug
[1:06:04] man and so here we were
[1:06:07] and we got her and and we're picking out
[1:06:10] the cactus and everything you know out
[1:06:11] of her clothes and stuff like that and i
[1:06:13] said honey
[1:06:14] i'm sorry uh that was a major dad fail
[1:06:18] because i should have been watching you
[1:06:20] and she goes is daddy sorry
[1:06:24] to this day she doesn't let me forget it
[1:06:26] you know
[1:06:27] she always reminds me of my dad fail
[1:06:29] kids are very good at that
[1:06:31] yeah and so we find out that someone who
[1:06:34] gets away from the fountain of life
[1:06:36] someone who gets away from the lord
[1:06:38] not that they're uh in a lost condition
[1:06:42] not that they're going to hell but
[1:06:43] they've just perhaps
[1:06:45] a little bit backslidden in their walk
[1:06:48] with the lord they're
[1:06:49] they're not praying like they used to
[1:06:50] they're not going to church like they
[1:06:52] used to
[1:06:53] they're not in fellowship with god like
[1:06:55] they used to and
[1:06:56] i'm sure you know some of us could i've
[1:06:59] been there myself
[1:07:00] you could agree with me and say yeah you
[1:07:02] know what i've been there
[1:07:03] i've gotten a little cold in my walk
[1:07:05] i've i've gotten uh
[1:07:07] a little far away from fellowship with
[1:07:09] god and and i've gotten a little
[1:07:11] cold and my heart's gotten a little
[1:07:13] hardened and i've become a sticker
[1:07:16] and everywhere i go i'm just sticking
[1:07:19] everything
[1:07:21] nothing's good enough the family's not
[1:07:23] good enough the food's not good enough
[1:07:25] i don't have a good enough job and you
[1:07:27] go on and on and the weather's too hot
[1:07:29] and
[1:07:29] you find fault in everybody else what is
[1:07:31] it we become sticky
[1:07:33] we become stickers and what do stickers
[1:07:36] do best they prick people
[1:07:41] i'm sure you've gotten uh pricked by a
[1:07:44] cactus before
[1:07:46] you ever got pricked by a cactus and ah
[1:07:48] yeah that kind of hurt
[1:07:50] 20 minutes later that's real itchy
[1:07:56] what does it do it releases a little
[1:07:59] poison
[1:08:00] it releases a little something that it
[1:08:02] doesn't just prick you but after a while
[1:08:04] you're
[1:08:04] you're scratching and you're itching and
[1:08:06] ah i don't know about you guys but
[1:08:09] i i i'm married into the love all family
[1:08:11] and they're
[1:08:12] big into doterra oils uh we got an oil
[1:08:16] that'll take away that itching steven
[1:08:18] come over here we'll take care of it a
[1:08:20] little bit of essential oils they'll fix
[1:08:22] it well
[1:08:22] essential oils will not fix the
[1:08:24] spiritual life there's only one kind of
[1:08:26] oil that we need that'll
[1:08:28] fix our spiritual life and that's the
[1:08:30] oil of the holy spirit
[1:08:32] hallelujah and so we find out when we
[1:08:35] get away from the lord and we get away
[1:08:37] from
[1:08:38] doing what we know to do we become
[1:08:39] sticky we stick people
[1:08:42] how do we stick people around us we
[1:08:44] stick them by our words
[1:08:46] the words that we say against one
[1:08:48] another we find out everybody else's
[1:08:51] faults
[1:08:54] but we got so many faults of our own and
[1:08:56] here we are
[1:08:57] sitting in the pew stickers
[1:09:01] don't get too close to sticky people
[1:09:05] because they're gonna stick you amen
[1:09:11] what does he say then that person
[1:09:12] becomes a sticker always finding fault
[1:09:15] and sticking i wonder how many amongst
[1:09:18] us this morning
[1:09:19] perhaps are in that spot
[1:09:24] i'm presbyterian i'm a methodist i'm
[1:09:26] so-and-so
[1:09:27] don't talk to me about that stuff a
[1:09:29] sticker
[1:09:30] a sticker has no fruits paragraph
[1:09:34] 63 you take that same plant a cactus
[1:09:37] put it into a land for a few generations
[1:09:40] where there's plenty of water
[1:09:41] and that sticker will unfold and will
[1:09:43] come a soft leaf
[1:09:45] bearing fruit hallelujah you just got to
[1:09:48] get it
[1:09:48] in the right conditions you got to get
[1:09:51] it in the right
[1:09:52] atmosphere and when we get our lives in
[1:09:55] the right condition
[1:09:56] when we get ourselves around the right
[1:09:58] atmosphere
[1:09:59] the atmosphere of god the atmosphere of
[1:10:02] the sweetness and presence of the holy
[1:10:04] spirit
[1:10:04] guess what our lives isn't as sticky
[1:10:06] anymore
[1:10:08] our stickers they they go away and and
[1:10:10] we become a pleasant tree a pleasant
[1:10:13] fl uh plant that's bearing pleasant
[1:10:16] fruit god let me feed upon the things of
[1:10:20] god
[1:10:21] let me dwell by the waters of life let
[1:10:24] me be a tree
[1:10:25] that is planted by the rivers of water
[1:10:29] lord that i'll bring forth fruit not for
[1:10:32] myself
[1:10:33] understand when a tree brings forth
[1:10:35] fruit it's not for
[1:10:36] itself a tree does not partake of its
[1:10:40] own fruit
[1:10:41] but a tree produces fruit for everybody
[1:10:44] else to be partakers of it
[1:10:46] it's just like they were up here and
[1:10:48] they're planned the musicians and the
[1:10:49] song leader
[1:10:50] they have a gift they have a talent and
[1:10:52] they're giving that fruit for the glory
[1:10:54] of god
[1:10:55] it's not for themselves but it's for you
[1:10:58] it's for the body of christ that they
[1:11:01] might enjoy
[1:11:02] the gift of god that was placed within
[1:11:04] their lives
[1:11:06] preaching the gospel is not for me
[1:11:10] preaching the gospel is for god's
[1:11:12] children
[1:11:13] understand that it's not for the
[1:11:14] minister it's not for the preacher
[1:11:18] brother branham said because it anybody
[1:11:20] that's really called
[1:11:21] to preach the gospel he runs from it
[1:11:24] he doesn't want to do it
[1:11:28] if you were to know me uh outside of the
[1:11:32] pulpit
[1:11:33] you'll find out yo uh man he's kind of
[1:11:35] quiet
[1:11:36] uh everybody tells me yeah you look you
[1:11:39] look real um
[1:11:41] natural up there stephen well yeah it
[1:11:44] don't feel natural
[1:11:45] i tell you what we're sitting in the
[1:11:47] back i'm looking for the exit sign
[1:11:49] how do i get out of here where no one
[1:11:51] will see me run
[1:11:55] but i've learned through the experience
[1:11:57] of preaching the gospel
[1:11:59] to be comfortable in uncomfortable
[1:12:02] situations
[1:12:06] amen
[1:12:08] what's the matter with the church today
[1:12:10] paragraph 64 the same
[1:12:12] the same uh sermon it's been said into a
[1:12:15] denomination
[1:12:16] that has put denominational creeds and
[1:12:18] bound it
[1:12:19] no joy just a sprinkle now and then of a
[1:12:22] little
[1:12:22] revival to hold it what it needs to be
[1:12:25] is to come out from among scoffers and
[1:12:27] unbelievers
[1:12:28] and be planted by the rivers of water
[1:12:32] understand that's what denominations
[1:12:34] have done throughout these
[1:12:36] seven church ages they took the word of
[1:12:38] god they hacked it they added two
[1:12:40] they took away uh they they had brother
[1:12:44] branham
[1:12:44] there's a quote from brother branham
[1:12:46] says they bound the holy spirit
[1:12:48] by their creeds and their dogmas and
[1:12:51] prevent the holy spirit
[1:12:52] from moving within the churches and in
[1:12:54] the lives of the people
[1:12:56] it didn't matter what the word of god
[1:12:58] says but our denomination
[1:13:00] says this do you guys realize what
[1:13:04] a creed or a dogma is perhaps for some
[1:13:07] of the younger people
[1:13:08] it's just a belief it's just something
[1:13:11] that a man has written down
[1:13:14] and yeah we know that the bible says
[1:13:16] this that
[1:13:17] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[1:13:20] and forever and
[1:13:21] what he did back then he is still able
[1:13:23] to do today
[1:13:25] but this church believes that he's only
[1:13:27] the same in certain ways
[1:13:30] he's only the same in where yeah you can
[1:13:33] receive salvation but
[1:13:34] healing is no longer for the people of
[1:13:37] god and
[1:13:38] he can't heal like he used to he can't
[1:13:40] do miracles he can't do this
[1:13:42] but the scripture says see what they did
[1:13:46] was they bound the people and they said
[1:13:48] well our church doesn't believe it he's
[1:13:50] a man of god he's up there and
[1:13:52] he's a pope or a priest or whatever he
[1:13:55] may be and he's a
[1:13:56] holy man of god and and what he says
[1:13:59] must be true
[1:14:01] therefore i believe him and he's only
[1:14:03] the same in certain ways and
[1:14:05] but not the same in his fullness so what
[1:14:08] did they do now the people they take
[1:14:10] that word
[1:14:11] because they believe they're hearing
[1:14:13] from god hide it in their hearts
[1:14:15] and they say well i what's the point in
[1:14:18] asking
[1:14:20] what's the point in asking for the
[1:14:21] healing of my body what's the point
[1:14:23] in asking uh what's the point in asking
[1:14:26] my boss if i can move to tucson
[1:14:28] and still work for the same company
[1:14:30] because ah it's not going to happen
[1:14:33] ask and ye shall receive
[1:14:36] seek and ye shall find knock and it
[1:14:39] shall be opened unto you
[1:14:40] hallelujah brother branham says it like
[1:14:43] this he says it's not
[1:14:44] seek just one time he says but it's keep
[1:14:47] seeking
[1:14:49] he says it's not just knock one time
[1:14:52] but you keep knocking you keep knocking
[1:14:55] when he doesn't answer the first time
[1:14:57] you keep knocking and you keep knocking
[1:15:00] until somebody answers the door
[1:15:03] seek and ye shall find keep seeking
[1:15:05] knock keep knocking and
[1:15:07] ask if you want it bad enough you'll
[1:15:09] keep asking man
[1:15:11] and it shall be given on to you
[1:15:15] i love that what is it it's a life of
[1:15:17] persistence
[1:15:19] it's a life of of of of not just seeking
[1:15:23] the lord for one day
[1:15:24] and and uh reading your bible one day
[1:15:27] after the week but it's a life
[1:15:29] of persistence and consistency
[1:15:32] that's a life that really gets far with
[1:15:34] god
[1:15:37] god don't want no half-baked christians
[1:15:41] but he wants those who are fully and
[1:15:43] fully committed
[1:15:45] hallelujah because when you're fully in
[1:15:48] something
[1:15:50] when you're fully committed to something
[1:15:52] you're in it
[1:15:53] you're in it your heart's in it your
[1:15:56] mind is in it
[1:15:57] and everything that you got within you
[1:15:59] it's in it
[1:16:00] why because you're in it i'm in it to
[1:16:03] win it man
[1:16:08] i don't just want to be some kind of
[1:16:10] some kind of chris well i'm happy i'm a
[1:16:11] christian
[1:16:13] i'm in it i want to make the rapture
[1:16:17] i want to make the rapture if it's a
[1:16:19] promise for me in this hour
[1:16:21] i want that promise to be fulfilled in
[1:16:23] my life i don't want to be happy
[1:16:26] which is saying i believe the message
[1:16:28] but i want to live it
[1:16:30] hallelujah what's the point in saying
[1:16:32] you believe it if we don't live it
[1:16:38] amen because when you really believe it
[1:16:41] when you really believe it not just a
[1:16:43] knowledge
[1:16:44] not just a head understanding but when
[1:16:47] you really believe it
[1:16:48] from the depths of your soul you know
[1:16:51] that you know
[1:16:52] it's the truth no matter what anybody
[1:16:54] says no matter who falls away
[1:16:56] no matter who walks away you know within
[1:16:58] your own heart
[1:16:59] this is the truth you live it
[1:17:04] it's the greatest sermon that you could
[1:17:05] ever preach
[1:17:07] is a sermon that is lived live your
[1:17:10] sermon
[1:17:11] and use words if you have to
[1:17:14] written epistles read of all men
[1:17:20] you know we've been ah i preached there
[1:17:23] wednesday night and there's a
[1:17:25] and there's a quote where brother
[1:17:26] branham says
[1:17:29] he goes it's that your testimony
[1:17:33] and it's your life that is going to
[1:17:35] judge
[1:17:36] this generation
[1:17:40] it's your testimony it's the testimony
[1:17:43] of our
[1:17:44] sisters and our mothers of being a good
[1:17:47] mother
[1:17:49] you know what's crazy it and it
[1:17:51] absolutely blows my mind
[1:17:52] uh when somebody sees uh like a like a
[1:17:56] famous person on the internet or
[1:17:57] whatever on
[1:17:59] on youtube whatever it may be and the
[1:18:01] person is actually
[1:18:03] a good parent they say wow it's so good
[1:18:06] to see somebody
[1:18:07] actually a good parent taking care of
[1:18:10] their kids
[1:18:13] it kind of blows my mind a little bit
[1:18:15] because i think isn't that what parents
[1:18:16] are supposed to do anyways
[1:18:20] it's supposed to be now it's now it's
[1:18:22] not normal for somebody to be a good
[1:18:24] parent
[1:18:25] that the testimony of holiness
[1:18:28] the testimony of having the the right
[1:18:31] attitude and
[1:18:32] and the right spirit uh for our sisters
[1:18:34] towards their husbands
[1:18:38] the testimony of letting your hair grow
[1:18:40] out and not cutting it
[1:18:41] that's the testimony that's going to
[1:18:43] judge this generation
[1:18:46] it's something that the world doesn't
[1:18:48] understand
[1:18:50] you know
[1:18:53] you only really find it throughout me
[1:18:56] the message
[1:18:57] how that uh our wives and the women they
[1:19:01] they come into subjection to their
[1:19:04] husbands
[1:19:05] right they respect their husbands they
[1:19:08] honor their husbands
[1:19:09] they love their husbands and by doing so
[1:19:11] they
[1:19:12] not that they lower themselves but they
[1:19:15] bring themselves
[1:19:17] under the headship of their husband
[1:19:22] it's because they are under the headship
[1:19:24] of their husband
[1:19:25] our father god but you talk about an age
[1:19:29] that we are living in
[1:19:31] where every woman wants to be the boss
[1:19:34] every woman wants to rule the roost
[1:19:37] every what every woman is uh uh
[1:19:40] i say it respectfully extremely
[1:19:43] domineering
[1:19:44] they want to have control they want to
[1:19:46] be leaders they want to be leaders in
[1:19:48] politics they want to be
[1:19:50] leaders of the country and all these
[1:19:51] different things
[1:19:53] when they see a woman who is living her
[1:19:56] life
[1:19:56] according to the word of god and
[1:19:59] bringing herself into subjection to his
[1:20:02] headship
[1:20:06] absolutely blows their mind don't you
[1:20:08] realize we're living in the 21st century
[1:20:11] those days are long gone past those
[1:20:14] days may have been long gone past but
[1:20:17] god's word
[1:20:18] is not long gone past for he is the same
[1:20:23] a testimony that'll judge this
[1:20:25] generation
[1:20:28] a testimony of a dad being a good dad
[1:20:32] a testimony of a husband being a good
[1:20:35] husband
[1:20:36] and always putting his family first
[1:20:39] putting
[1:20:39] their needs first before his own needs
[1:20:43] that's a testimony that's going to judge
[1:20:45] this generation
[1:20:47] a testimony of living a good clean life
[1:20:50] a life lived by the word of god for the
[1:20:53] day and hour in which you live
[1:20:55] is the word of god being made flesh
[1:20:59] once again just like it was through
[1:21:01] jesus christ
[1:21:03] so is it through you and i what is it
[1:21:06] god in you
[1:21:07] the hope of glory
[1:21:10] hallelujah praise the lord
[1:21:14] so we find out that dehydration is one
[1:21:17] of the main causes that people in the
[1:21:19] desert would die
[1:21:22] there was a while back a person from
[1:21:24] maricopa
[1:21:26] and he was his neighbors to part of my
[1:21:28] family out there
[1:21:29] and he was in his 70s and so he grew up
[1:21:33] around the desert and everything well
[1:21:34] anyways
[1:21:35] he got out in the car and he started
[1:21:37] driving and and he ran out of gasoline
[1:21:40] and so he get out of his car and he
[1:21:42] started walking through the desert
[1:21:44] because he thought he knew where he was
[1:21:45] well long story short he
[1:21:48] he got lost in the desert he got turned
[1:21:50] around and he ended up dying
[1:21:52] out of dehydration have any of you ever
[1:21:54] gotten thirsty before
[1:21:59] i tell you what the desert will make you
[1:22:03] thirsty
[1:22:05] you know they say whenever you uh
[1:22:07] whenever you wait until you're thirsty
[1:22:09] you've waited too long
[1:22:13] hallelujah people in the desert they die
[1:22:19] failing to find water and if we fail to
[1:22:22] drink from the fountain of life who is
[1:22:23] jesus christ and him alone
[1:22:26] you will die in your sins it doesn't
[1:22:29] matter what you believe
[1:22:31] it doesn't matter how good of a person
[1:22:34] you are or the good things that you've
[1:22:36] done
[1:22:36] even if you believe this end time
[1:22:38] message it's meeting
[1:22:40] christ that saves you it's not having an
[1:22:43] understanding
[1:22:44] of the message it's not having an
[1:22:46] understanding of the day and hour in
[1:22:48] which in which you live
[1:22:50] but it's having a relationship with
[1:22:53] jesus christ
[1:22:54] that's what saves you from your sins
[1:22:59] because what is this message all about
[1:23:02] it's jesus christ
[1:23:03] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:23:11] many times in our lives as christians
[1:23:14] we're going to come across periods where
[1:23:16] it seems like we are in a desert place
[1:23:19] and chances are some of you that have
[1:23:21] been around for a while and
[1:23:23] you've been saved for a while and you've
[1:23:25] been serving god for a while
[1:23:27] chances are you've been already been
[1:23:29] through a desert place in your life
[1:23:34] well what is a desert place stephen it's
[1:23:37] a dry
[1:23:38] it's a hot it's an uncomfortable
[1:23:40] situation it's an uncomfortable
[1:23:42] environment
[1:23:43] it's a place that we don't like to be
[1:23:46] too often
[1:23:47] as a desert place typically when you're
[1:23:51] in a desert place you're alone
[1:23:54] you're by yourself
[1:23:57] typically in desert places you're dry
[1:24:01] you need a drink and there's nowhere to
[1:24:04] drink from
[1:24:07] in desert places it feels like you're
[1:24:09] always all alone
[1:24:11] there's nobody with you there's nobody
[1:24:13] to comfort you and there's no one to put
[1:24:15] their arm around you
[1:24:16] what is it that's a desert place
[1:24:22] you can find no inspiration you can
[1:24:25] find no anointing all you can
[1:24:28] find is that sticky prickiness just like
[1:24:31] the cactus out there
[1:24:34] there's no anointing oil there's no
[1:24:36] inspiration there's no joy
[1:24:38] there's no love there's no peace and
[1:24:40] everything is just upside down
[1:24:45] what is it it's a desert place
[1:24:50] you know desert places are an extremely
[1:24:52] lonely place to be in
[1:24:58] are many trials in our lives that would
[1:25:00] cause us to feel like we are going
[1:25:02] through
[1:25:02] a desert place perhaps we've had a loved
[1:25:05] one who has
[1:25:07] passed on or something has happened
[1:25:09] within our lives and
[1:25:10] we could go on and on and on of the the
[1:25:13] things that could have
[1:25:14] happened within our lives that would
[1:25:16] cause us to be in such a sticky dry
[1:25:18] place
[1:25:19] but we're going to find out this morning
[1:25:22] throughout the scriptures
[1:25:24] that god uses desert places
[1:25:27] in our lives god doesn't do anything
[1:25:30] without there being a purpose behind it
[1:25:35] hallelujah
[1:25:38] so as we look through some of these
[1:25:40] scriptural examples
[1:25:42] we are going to see that god not only
[1:25:45] does god
[1:25:46] use these desert experiences in our
[1:25:48] lives
[1:25:50] but they have a purpose behind it
[1:25:52] understand that god does nothing
[1:25:54] without there being a purpose that ought
[1:25:57] to give us comfort this morning
[1:25:59] that no matter where we are in our lives
[1:26:02] right now
[1:26:02] no matter where we were in our lives in
[1:26:05] the history of our lives
[1:26:07] god has a purpose for it you know i just
[1:26:10] went
[1:26:11] hunting here this weekend up in baghdad
[1:26:13] it's archery season
[1:26:14] right now and you know the mule deer
[1:26:18] are a very kind of majestic animal
[1:26:22] uh one second you see them and next
[1:26:24] second they're gone and
[1:26:25] and god really knew what he was doing
[1:26:27] and and uh
[1:26:28] the color of their coat and their fur
[1:26:30] and stuff because man
[1:26:31] unless they wiggle their ears they're
[1:26:33] kind of hard to see or unless they jump
[1:26:35] out right in front
[1:26:36] of you you know and so i was just by
[1:26:38] myself and i was glassing and
[1:26:40] and i'd glass for a little bit and drive
[1:26:42] a little further
[1:26:44] and the thing about it is if i'm
[1:26:48] if i'm glassing under a bush or if i'm
[1:26:50] glassing one side of a hill
[1:26:52] i can only see what's in front of me
[1:26:56] but when i keep driving onward and i
[1:26:58] turn
[1:26:59] back and i glass that same hillside
[1:27:02] chances are there's a deer hitting under
[1:27:05] that same tree that i already glassed
[1:27:08] but now i'm looking back on it from a
[1:27:10] different angle
[1:27:12] and now i can see it i can see it from
[1:27:14] an angle
[1:27:15] that i never seen before so it is with
[1:27:18] our lives
[1:27:19] when we are in a desert place and we are
[1:27:22] in uncomfortable
[1:27:23] situations we don't know the purpose of
[1:27:26] god
[1:27:26] at that very time but as we go on in our
[1:27:30] lives
[1:27:30] and we begin to look back sometimes god
[1:27:33] reveals it to us
[1:27:35] and we say wow that's why i went through
[1:27:38] that trial
[1:27:39] that's why i was by myself that's why
[1:27:41] that's why
[1:27:42] and the light switch goes on ding
[1:27:45] and now all of a sudden you realize why
[1:27:48] you went through the pain why you went
[1:27:49] through the suffering
[1:27:51] but at the time of the trial man
[1:27:55] all you see is the trial you can't see
[1:27:58] the forest for all the trees
[1:28:00] or the tree for the forest whatever one
[1:28:01] it is
[1:28:08] exodus chapter three verses one through
[1:28:10] five
[1:28:11] now moses kept the flock of jethro his
[1:28:13] father-in-law
[1:28:14] the priest of midian and he laid the
[1:28:17] flock to the backside of the desert
[1:28:19] and came to the mountain of god even to
[1:28:22] horeb
[1:28:22] notice the shepherd the shepherd leads
[1:28:25] the flock
[1:28:26] to the backside of the desert
[1:28:30] and the angel of the lord appeared onto
[1:28:32] him in a flame of fire out of the midst
[1:28:34] of a bush
[1:28:35] and he looked and behold the bush burned
[1:28:37] with fire and the bush was not consumed
[1:28:40] and moses said i will now turn aside and
[1:28:43] see this great sight
[1:28:45] why the bush is not burned
[1:28:49] can you imagine coming across something
[1:28:51] that seems to be on fire but it's not
[1:28:53] consumed
[1:28:54] no doubt it would attract our attention
[1:28:57] also
[1:28:58] and that's what the supernatural is for
[1:29:01] it's to catch the attention of the
[1:29:02] people
[1:29:04] and that's what brother branham's first
[1:29:06] uh two pulls in his ministry was all
[1:29:08] about
[1:29:09] it was to catch the attention of the
[1:29:11] people never was there
[1:29:13] ever a man that had uh that anybody had
[1:29:16] ever seen with the gifts that brother
[1:29:17] branham had in his life
[1:29:19] the first pull he would take them by the
[1:29:22] hand and and here there would be a a
[1:29:24] little sensation and a little bumps
[1:29:25] would come
[1:29:26] come upon his hand and he would say oh
[1:29:28] you have uh such and such a disease or
[1:29:31] you have this this wrong with you and
[1:29:33] here let me pray for you
[1:29:35] and he would pray for them and when they
[1:29:37] were healed the bumps would go away
[1:29:39] and he would say he could say with an
[1:29:41] assurance thus saith the lord
[1:29:43] you're healed of that disease you were
[1:29:45] healed of that sickness
[1:29:47] because the bumps were no longer there
[1:29:50] second pull of his ministry
[1:29:51] it takes a another step further notice
[1:29:54] that first pull
[1:29:55] was all to do with the outer man it was
[1:29:58] all to do with the flesh it was all to
[1:30:00] do
[1:30:01] with the emotions it was all to do with
[1:30:03] the sensations
[1:30:07] brother branham said ah i wish i wish i
[1:30:10] hadn't showed anybody all these stuff
[1:30:12] because now everybody's got oil and
[1:30:14] blood coming out of their hands and out
[1:30:15] of their foreheads and
[1:30:16] everybody's got a sign and what is it
[1:30:18] done all it's done is made a
[1:30:20] carnal impersonation of a true gift of
[1:30:23] god
[1:30:25] and now it goes a little deeper
[1:30:27] understand we're made up of
[1:30:29] three parts our bodies our spirit
[1:30:33] and our soul the body is the outer man
[1:30:36] has everything to do with see taste feel
[1:30:38] smell and hear
[1:30:40] but now it goes a little deeper he says
[1:30:43] what was that second pull he said it's a
[1:30:46] discernment of the hearts
[1:30:49] he said you'll you'll know the very
[1:30:51] secrets
[1:30:52] and the desires that's upon the people's
[1:30:54] hearts
[1:30:55] that's what the word of god is it's a
[1:30:57] two-edged sword
[1:30:59] cutting asunder and dividing between the
[1:31:02] bone and the marrow and
[1:31:03] it's that discernment a discerning of
[1:31:06] the thoughts
[1:31:07] and the intents of the hearts so now he
[1:31:10] would
[1:31:11] he didn't even need to it had nothing to
[1:31:13] do with the outer man
[1:31:14] he didn't need people to come up he
[1:31:16] didn't have to lay hands upon them
[1:31:18] somebody could touch could touch god
[1:31:21] they could touch god by faith not touch
[1:31:24] brother branham
[1:31:25] they could touch god by faith and he
[1:31:27] would reach down into the back of
[1:31:29] by faith he he would speak there and he
[1:31:31] would say ah there's somebody in the
[1:31:32] back and
[1:31:33] yada yada and thus saith the lord you
[1:31:35] have this on your heart and you have
[1:31:37] that and this has happened in your lives
[1:31:41] what was it it was the same god
[1:31:44] it was the same spirit but in a
[1:31:46] different manifestation
[1:31:48] now it went beyond the flesh man into
[1:31:51] the spiritual realm
[1:31:54] hallelujah what were these things for it
[1:31:56] was to catch the attention
[1:31:58] of the people god is really moving god
[1:32:02] is doing something
[1:32:03] there's this little man from kentucky
[1:32:05] and wow you ought to you ought to see
[1:32:07] the gifts that this man has
[1:32:08] that's following his ministry man can't
[1:32:12] do these things we've never seen the
[1:32:13] like of it in all our days
[1:32:16] what was it for it was to catch their
[1:32:18] attention to the third pull
[1:32:21] to the revealing of the word which goes
[1:32:23] beyond
[1:32:25] the outer court it goes beyond the inner
[1:32:28] court
[1:32:28] the tabernacle and it goes into the
[1:32:31] holiest of holies
[1:32:33] the word of god that'll never lose its
[1:32:35] power
[1:32:36] what is it that's being revealed to his
[1:32:38] bride in these last days
[1:32:41] hallelujah
[1:32:48] no because and this might be a theme
[1:32:51] that just keeps popping up in my mind
[1:32:54] right now but there's a purpose for it
[1:32:57] there's a purpose for it there was a
[1:32:59] purpose for the first two pulls
[1:33:01] but the purpose was to catch the
[1:33:03] people's attention
[1:33:05] understand things of god god has a
[1:33:07] purpose for you
[1:33:08] this morning not just for the minister
[1:33:12] not just for the song leaders not just
[1:33:15] for the musicians
[1:33:16] not just for the people that hold a
[1:33:18] position within a
[1:33:20] local body church but he has a purpose
[1:33:23] for each and every one of us
[1:33:26] and each and every one of you have a
[1:33:28] gift of god
[1:33:31] it doesn't have to be preaching it
[1:33:32] doesn't have to be it could be something
[1:33:35] as simple as saying amen to the word of
[1:33:37] god
[1:33:39] some people have a gift of giving
[1:33:44] there's a brother in our church amos
[1:33:46] peterson
[1:33:47] i i've worked for a brother amos for
[1:33:49] nine ten years
[1:33:51] and i have never met a person in my life
[1:33:53] that is such
[1:33:54] a giver as brother amos
[1:33:58] my goodness you tell him yeah i really
[1:33:59] like your hat here you go
[1:34:02] well i wasn't saying that because i want
[1:34:04] it but i really like your watch too
[1:34:06] [Laughter]
[1:34:13] it's just his nature it's just the gift
[1:34:15] that he has
[1:34:16] now i can try to impersonate that gift
[1:34:19] but i'll give begrudgingly i'll give
[1:34:23] begrudgingly
[1:34:24] you know the lord really has to get put
[1:34:26] heavy upon my heart
[1:34:28] for me to really reach out and give
[1:34:30] something like that but for amos
[1:34:32] it's it's just natural it's just how he
[1:34:35] is
[1:34:36] but what is it for it's uh its purpose
[1:34:39] is to serve the body of christ
[1:34:41] you ever notice people uh in our church
[1:34:44] when
[1:34:45] when somebody is sick or somebody has
[1:34:46] had a baby or whatever um
[1:34:48] they have like this online thing where
[1:34:52] they send out an email and they send out
[1:34:54] food to bring and
[1:34:55] it's all kind of organized right and you
[1:34:57] kind of notice and
[1:34:58] i can brag on my wife here she's often
[1:35:01] told me well i don't know
[1:35:03] uh what my gift is i said honey you have
[1:35:06] a gift to serve
[1:35:08] every time there's an opportunity every
[1:35:10] time there's a chance to make a meal
[1:35:12] anytime there's a a chance to help
[1:35:14] somebody or
[1:35:15] to do something for somebody she's there
[1:35:18] she's the first one
[1:35:20] and it's always the same people that
[1:35:21] sign up and do it
[1:35:23] and it's always the same ones that don't
[1:35:26] and the people who don't normally do it
[1:35:28] and they try to do it once in a while
[1:35:30] they never follow through
[1:35:32] that's okay it's just not their gift
[1:35:35] but my wife is there even though she's
[1:35:38] busy
[1:35:39] even though she doesn't have the time
[1:35:41] she makes the time
[1:35:43] saints of god there's never a good time
[1:35:46] to help somebody
[1:35:47] there's never a good time to serve
[1:35:49] somebody there's never a good time or an
[1:35:51] appropriate time
[1:35:52] we got to make the time one for another
[1:35:56] amen what is it as gifts within the body
[1:35:58] that god uses for the body
[1:36:01] and each one of us have a gift
[1:36:06] we get so caught up in ministering and
[1:36:10] and all the gifts that's before the
[1:36:12] people you know
[1:36:14] and it's just a little part of it
[1:36:17] it's just a little part of it we are all
[1:36:19] part of the same body
[1:36:21] and we all have a purpose to serve that
[1:36:23] body in any way that we can
[1:36:26] amen amen yes lord
[1:36:31] verse 4 exodus 3 and
[1:36:35] when the lord saw that that he turned
[1:36:37] aside to see
[1:36:38] god called on to him out of the midst of
[1:36:40] the bush and said moses moses
[1:36:42] and he said here am i and he said draw
[1:36:45] not nigh hither
[1:36:46] put up thy shoes from thy feet for the
[1:36:49] place where i'll now stand
[1:36:51] is holy ground moses was raised in the
[1:36:54] house of pharaoh
[1:36:55] moses looked like an egyptian he talked
[1:36:58] like an egyptian
[1:36:59] and he was taught as the egyptian
[1:37:01] children were taught
[1:37:02] but at an appointed time he realized
[1:37:05] that that's not
[1:37:06] who he really was though he might have
[1:37:09] acted like one and he was raised like
[1:37:11] one and he
[1:37:12] perhaps even he talked like an egyptian
[1:37:14] but at god's appointed time
[1:37:16] he realized i am not an egyptian i am
[1:37:20] not part of this community
[1:37:21] i am not part of their culture i am a
[1:37:24] jew
[1:37:25] and these are my people and this is
[1:37:27] what's happening
[1:37:28] to my people who i who i really should
[1:37:31] be associated with
[1:37:32] and he turned and he turned to try to
[1:37:35] help the egypt the
[1:37:36] jewish people so it is with every seed
[1:37:39] of god
[1:37:41] we were raised in the world we were born
[1:37:44] in the world
[1:37:44] we were born in sin our lives was shaped
[1:37:47] in iniquity
[1:37:49] we came to the world speaking lies
[1:37:51] sinners to begin with
[1:37:52] but at an appointed time at an appointed
[1:37:56] time
[1:37:57] we realized i may be of this world but i
[1:38:00] may be
[1:38:01] in this world but i am not of this world
[1:38:04] i don't belong here this i might look
[1:38:08] like the world and i might have dressed
[1:38:09] like the world and i might have stank
[1:38:12] like the world but at an appointed time
[1:38:14] god had an appointment with me at an
[1:38:17] appointed time
[1:38:18] god had an appointment with you and he
[1:38:21] told you who you really are
[1:38:23] hallelujah as sheep can can act like a
[1:38:26] pig
[1:38:27] and smell like a pig and can roll in the
[1:38:31] dirt and everything like a pig but you
[1:38:33] give that sheep a bath one time
[1:38:36] you'll find out that it's not a pig it's
[1:38:38] really a sheep
[1:38:39] so it is with every son and daughter of
[1:38:41] god when we're washed by the water of
[1:38:44] the word by the water of separation
[1:38:47] we realize i'm not of this world i'm not
[1:38:50] a pig
[1:38:51] i'm a sheep why because it's an
[1:38:54] appointment from god almighty
[1:39:00] god has an appointment with every
[1:39:02] predestinated
[1:39:03] son and daughter of god and god keeps
[1:39:07] all of his appointments
[1:39:10] hallelujah
[1:39:13] yeah he's never late you know you know
[1:39:17] we're bound by time that's our problem
[1:39:20] we are bound time creatures
[1:39:25] yeah god is not bound by time he is an
[1:39:28] on-time god you know that little song
[1:39:32] he's a non-time god
[1:39:35] yes he is oh
[1:39:38] he's an on-time god
[1:39:42] yes he is
[1:39:46] he's an on-time god might not what's the
[1:39:49] rest of the words of that song do you
[1:39:50] guys know what
[1:39:51] you guys don't know that song might not
[1:39:54] come when you want him
[1:39:55] but he'll be there right on time
[1:39:59] he's an on time god yes he is
[1:40:04] i'm sure the three hebrew children
[1:40:05] thought he was late coming into the
[1:40:07] fiery furnace
[1:40:08] but he was just on time i'm sure daniel
[1:40:11] and the lion's den
[1:40:13] thought that god was late but he's never
[1:40:16] late for any of his appointments
[1:40:18] and so it is with us it seems like god
[1:40:21] is late in coming on the scene
[1:40:23] but he is an on-time god and he keeps
[1:40:26] all of his appointments
[1:40:29] thank you lord
[1:40:33] at the age of 40 moses fled egypt after
[1:40:36] slaying a man in the wilderness
[1:40:39] or he fled to a desert place and it was
[1:40:43] there that god got a hold of moses by
[1:40:45] the way of the burning bush
[1:40:47] brother branham said that it took god 40
[1:40:49] years in the backside of the desert to
[1:40:51] unlearn moses
[1:40:52] of the 40 years that he had learned
[1:40:55] while
[1:40:55] in egypt 1957
[1:40:59] faith brother branham says how that
[1:41:02] moses after having 40 years of religious
[1:41:04] training by his mother
[1:41:06] by his mother how having 40 years of
[1:41:09] military might in his hands
[1:41:11] of how to whip a nation how to conquer
[1:41:13] and taken god
[1:41:14] 40 years to take it out of him but once
[1:41:17] out there
[1:41:18] in the wilderness alone what was god
[1:41:20] doing to moses in the wilderness
[1:41:22] he was taken away all of his previous
[1:41:25] learnings
[1:41:27] one day he come face to face with god in
[1:41:29] a burning bush
[1:41:31] and he was better equipped in five
[1:41:33] minutes after he had talked with god
[1:41:35] than 80 years of schooling had done
[1:41:37] anything to him
[1:41:38] he was a coward dying a thousand deaths
[1:41:41] and after meeting god he wished he had a
[1:41:43] thousand lives to die to die for christ
[1:41:47] he was ready to go there was nothing
[1:41:49] could stop him
[1:41:50] though he had no army through his edu
[1:41:53] though his
[1:41:53] education was no good to him
[1:41:58] moses slayed an egyptian living off of
[1:42:01] his mother's revelation or understanding
[1:42:03] that god was going to use him to deliver
[1:42:05] the children of israel
[1:42:08] it was his mother's revelation
[1:42:12] it wasn't his own revelation it was an
[1:42:14] understanding that he had it was a head
[1:42:16] knowledge
[1:42:17] that god was going to use him and so he
[1:42:20] said well if god is going to use me
[1:42:22] i'm going to take matters into my own
[1:42:25] hands
[1:42:26] and he saw the the egyptian uh treating
[1:42:29] the jewish person
[1:42:30] harshly what did he do we took matters
[1:42:32] into his own nature
[1:42:34] to his own carnal hands and he slayed
[1:42:36] that egyptian
[1:42:40] what did it what did it do what did it
[1:42:43] profit
[1:42:44] it did nothing but make a stinking
[1:42:48] dead egyptian why
[1:42:51] because he was living off of a carnal
[1:42:53] understanding
[1:42:55] but when he got into the presence of god
[1:42:57] almighty
[1:42:58] when he got into the presence of god and
[1:43:00] he met god face to face
[1:43:03] and brother branham says in five minutes
[1:43:06] he knew more of god than
[1:43:07] in all of his previous years of learning
[1:43:10] then he knew to wait on god
[1:43:13] then he knew that it wasn't going to be
[1:43:15] him doing it
[1:43:17] but it was going to be god taking care
[1:43:19] of business
[1:43:20] it would be god going before him it
[1:43:22] would be god coming after him
[1:43:24] it'll be god doing it therefore it has
[1:43:26] nothing to do with you and i
[1:43:28] my brother my sister it has everything
[1:43:31] to do with god
[1:43:32] god doesn't need our help to bring his
[1:43:34] promises to pass
[1:43:36] he will bring him to pass at his
[1:43:38] appointed times
[1:43:39] we can't live off of other people's
[1:43:41] revelation
[1:43:44] you know david tried to do it one time
[1:43:47] there was a man and his name was goliath
[1:43:51] and he was a giant he was one of the
[1:43:53] biggest man in the land and he was a
[1:43:55] soldier from his youth
[1:43:57] perhaps he had slain hundreds of men and
[1:44:00] everybody was scared of him
[1:44:03] and here he was he was making this bragg
[1:44:06] and he was telling the children of
[1:44:08] israel
[1:44:08] bring down your greatest soldier and the
[1:44:11] one that
[1:44:12] slays the other one will be servants one
[1:44:14] to another
[1:44:15] and here was saul this is amazing saul
[1:44:18] was head and shoulders above all
[1:44:20] of the people of of israel but yet he
[1:44:23] was shaking in his boots
[1:44:26] oh he's out there again i gotta use the
[1:44:32] restroom
[1:44:35] he's always hiding he's always trying to
[1:44:37] get away from it
[1:44:38] he's always trying to hide from uh from
[1:44:41] this goliath and here was this little
[1:44:43] bitty guy
[1:44:44] david david had a revelation
[1:44:48] but saul tried to give david his own
[1:44:51] ecclesiastical knowledge
[1:44:53] well son if you're gonna go out here and
[1:44:55] and you're gonna you're gonna
[1:44:56] fight this guy uh let me tell you here's
[1:44:59] my armor
[1:45:00] he wasn't using it he's too scared to
[1:45:03] use it
[1:45:04] here's my armor here's my sword here's
[1:45:06] the things that i fight with here
[1:45:08] take my stuff and no doubt saul being
[1:45:11] head and shoulders above everybody
[1:45:14] no doubt the armor didn't fit him very
[1:45:16] good
[1:45:17] you guys some of you guys are kind of
[1:45:18] taller i'm shorter
[1:45:20] you know if i was to put you those of
[1:45:22] you that are tall
[1:45:24] if i was to put your jacket on huh
[1:45:27] be down over my hands and trailing off
[1:45:30] the ground
[1:45:30] i can't preach in your jacket because
[1:45:33] i'd look like a fool
[1:45:36] here was david out here he was going out
[1:45:38] to meet goliath with somebody else's
[1:45:40] jacket on
[1:45:41] somebody else's revelation was somebody
[1:45:43] else's understanding
[1:45:45] it didn't fit him it didn't fit it was
[1:45:48] too big
[1:45:48] it was just a carnal understanding and
[1:45:50] finally he got to a place he said forget
[1:45:53] this
[1:45:53] this doesn't belong to me he had a
[1:45:55] revelation he said the same god
[1:45:58] that was with me when i slew the bear
[1:46:01] the same god that was with me when i
[1:46:03] slew the lion
[1:46:04] that same god is with me now
[1:46:07] i have the same weapon that i had when i
[1:46:10] salute those two and i'm gonna use that
[1:46:12] same weapon
[1:46:13] i don't need your carnal understanding i
[1:46:15] don't need your
[1:46:16] head knowledge but i got a revelation
[1:46:19] that the god that was with me then
[1:46:21] is the god that is with me right now
[1:46:24] because he's an on time
[1:46:25] right now god and he's with me
[1:46:31] goliath would have slew david if he went
[1:46:34] in somebody else's
[1:46:36] revelation with somebody else's
[1:46:39] understanding
[1:46:40] but he stood upon his own revelation
[1:46:43] my brother and my sister you can't live
[1:46:45] your life
[1:46:46] off of somebody else's revelation
[1:46:49] it's got to be your revelation it can't
[1:46:52] be mom and dad's
[1:46:53] it can't be the pastors it can't be your
[1:46:56] neighbors it can't be your uncle
[1:46:58] but it's got to be your own revelation
[1:47:00] because when it's your own revelation
[1:47:02] when you're by yourself and you have to
[1:47:05] stand and fight alone
[1:47:06] you will fight because it's yours
[1:47:11] god help us lord let it go from the
[1:47:13] understanding of the mind
[1:47:15] and let it go into my heart because out
[1:47:17] of the heart
[1:47:19] that's what our manifestations come from
[1:47:21] is from our heart
[1:47:22] lord let me live from my heart lord
[1:47:26] increase my revelation
[1:47:29] hallelujah it's only by revelation you
[1:47:32] can overcome
[1:47:34] and you know that there's a quote where
[1:47:36] brother branham says
[1:47:39] he's talking on adultery and he says you
[1:47:41] know
[1:47:43] he's talking about the outer man and the
[1:47:44] and the and the inner man
[1:47:46] he says you could say i know i'm not
[1:47:49] supposed to commit adultery
[1:47:51] i know it i'm a christian i know the
[1:47:53] word says it
[1:47:54] i know my pastor says it but it's out
[1:47:56] here
[1:47:57] and it's here it doesn't come from the
[1:48:01] soul
[1:48:02] because the soul controls the spirit
[1:48:05] which controls the body it's the nature
[1:48:07] of each one right
[1:48:11] he says but when it comes from that
[1:48:12] control tower
[1:48:14] from the heart he says that brings
[1:48:16] everything else into subjection
[1:48:19] and he goes you don't just know because
[1:48:21] he says well i know i shouldn't do it
[1:48:23] but they go out and do it anyway because
[1:48:25] it doesn't come from the control tower
[1:48:28] it's just an understanding but when it
[1:48:30] comes from the control tower when it
[1:48:32] comes from your heart
[1:48:34] i know i'm not supposed to do it
[1:48:36] therefore i'm not
[1:48:37] going to do it why because it's a
[1:48:39] revelation
[1:48:41] you see the difference in an
[1:48:43] understanding and a revelation
[1:48:46] god increase our revelation amen
[1:48:52] notice where he was here where moses was
[1:48:57] he was at the backside of the desert
[1:49:00] what was the purpose of moses being in
[1:49:02] the backside of the desert
[1:49:04] it was for him to meet god face to face
[1:49:07] and it was because of his previous
[1:49:09] choices of slaying that egyptian that
[1:49:11] took him there
[1:49:13] saints of god you might have made some
[1:49:14] bad choices in your lives
[1:49:16] but understand that those who are called
[1:49:18] of god and according to his purpose
[1:49:20] god will use your choices to bring about
[1:49:23] his will
[1:49:24] don't let your past dictate your future
[1:49:32] some of you need to give stop giving
[1:49:34] yourself such a hard time
[1:49:39] and you don't know steven what i did
[1:49:42] you don't know how much of a rascal i
[1:49:44] was
[1:49:45] you don't know what i did yesterday
[1:49:49] you don't know what i did when i was a
[1:49:51] child you don't know my previous
[1:49:53] it's true i don't but if you believe in
[1:49:55] the blood of jesus
[1:49:56] christ it cleanses us from all of our
[1:49:59] sins
[1:50:00] and all of our iniquities that's satan
[1:50:03] trying to use your past to prevent you
[1:50:05] from having a closer walk with god
[1:50:07] in your present day life stop it
[1:50:13] amen
[1:50:17] we find out that so we find out there
[1:50:21] that um
[1:50:22] in that same mount that mount horeb
[1:50:24] where moses led
[1:50:26] led his sheep to the backside of the
[1:50:28] desert
[1:50:29] which is also called mount sinai that
[1:50:32] that's where god gave moses the ten
[1:50:34] commandments
[1:50:36] what was this desert place for what was
[1:50:39] the purpose for it
[1:50:40] in moses's life it was for god to reveal
[1:50:44] himself to him
[1:50:45] and to reveal also his word to him
[1:50:49] it was to meet god face to face and it
[1:50:51] was there in that same mount
[1:50:53] that god gave him the ten commandments
[1:50:55] what was it for to reveal himself
[1:50:57] and to reveal his word to him hallelujah
[1:51:01] paul was on the road to damascus one day
[1:51:04] he was persecuting the church we all
[1:51:07] know the story there was a light
[1:51:08] appeared from the heavens and it said
[1:51:10] unto him
[1:51:11] saul saul why persecute us thou me
[1:51:15] notice it was the same voice that had
[1:51:18] spoken to moses
[1:51:19] moses moses saul
[1:51:23] saul and saul being a devout jew
[1:51:27] he knew not to call that light anything
[1:51:30] but lord
[1:51:32] he knew the teachings here was this
[1:51:34] supernatural light
[1:51:35] a supernatural experience was happening
[1:51:37] a supernatural being was talking to him
[1:51:40] and he said lord who are you
[1:51:45] i want to know you have been i've been
[1:51:47] serving and i've been religious my whole
[1:51:49] life but
[1:51:50] i don't know you lord who are you
[1:51:54] he said i am jesus whom now
[1:51:58] persecutest it's hard for you to kick
[1:52:00] against the pricks huh
[1:52:02] what was he doing i am jesus
[1:52:06] the i am of the old testament was the
[1:52:09] father above
[1:52:09] us he changed his mask he changed his
[1:52:13] form what was that was that word called
[1:52:16] ah
[1:52:17] oh it goes from my mind right now uh
[1:52:20] that greek word
[1:52:22] where god he he changes his mask and he
[1:52:25] changes his form
[1:52:27] he huh and morpha
[1:52:30] that's it see i'm glad we got some we
[1:52:32] got some scholars in here
[1:52:34] some men that are in the message to help
[1:52:37] young men like me out when my mind goes
[1:52:39] blank huh
[1:52:41] he and morpha he changed his mask
[1:52:44] not a different god it was the same god
[1:52:47] the i am
[1:52:48] the father above us he led the children
[1:52:51] of israel he was in
[1:52:52] morpha he changed his mask to jesus
[1:52:55] the son of god with us
[1:52:59] understand god doesn't
[1:53:02] expect someone else to continue his work
[1:53:05] but he continues to work himself
[1:53:08] it was the father above us god with us
[1:53:12] and now it's god in us what's he doing
[1:53:15] all the time he's changing his form
[1:53:17] he's changing his mask and then more
[1:53:20] continue the work of god
[1:53:24] it's not us doing the work it's not the
[1:53:26] ministry that perfects the saints
[1:53:29] it's god the holy ghost in the ministry
[1:53:32] that's perfecting the saints
[1:53:35] if any man gets up and tells you that
[1:53:37] he's the one that's perfecting you and
[1:53:39] it's
[1:53:39] it's his ministry that's perfecting you
[1:53:41] and outside of him
[1:53:42] uh you're lost you run from that man as
[1:53:46] fast as you can
[1:53:48] it's not the man it's god
[1:53:54] that's what's wrong these days i think
[1:53:55] you know man they uh
[1:53:57] brother branham said uh god uses a man
[1:53:59] and he blesses his ministry a little bit
[1:54:02] and all of a sudden he gets uh high he
[1:54:04] gets puffed up in
[1:54:05] a stuffed shirt thinks he's the one
[1:54:08] that's doing it
[1:54:09] it's not him it's god that's doing it
[1:54:12] god help us to stay humble huh
[1:54:20] sure
[1:54:22] above us god with us
[1:54:25] and now god in us you know that light
[1:54:28] it blinded the eyes of paul
[1:54:32] it blinded his eyes to the situations
[1:54:36] around him and everything that was going
[1:54:37] on he
[1:54:38] he couldn't see until finally that
[1:54:41] i believe it was cornelius had to come
[1:54:44] and he had to pray for
[1:54:46] saul he had to pray for him to restore
[1:54:49] his sight
[1:54:50] god had to blind saul that he might see
[1:54:54] spiritual things let me just say this
[1:54:57] this morning lord
[1:54:59] blind our eyes to the things of the
[1:55:01] world father
[1:55:02] blind our eyes to the fashions and the
[1:55:04] music and
[1:55:05] all these different distractions coveted
[1:55:08] 19 and
[1:55:09] politics and all these different things
[1:55:12] lord blind my eyes to these things
[1:55:14] that my supernatural eyes might be
[1:55:17] opened
[1:55:18] because these are just natural things
[1:55:20] that's designed to take our eyes off of
[1:55:22] what god is actually doing
[1:55:24] in the spiritual realm
[1:55:30] god help us genesis uh
[1:55:33] galatians 1 15-17 but when it pleased
[1:55:37] god who separated me from my mother's
[1:55:39] womb and called me by his grace to
[1:55:40] reveal his son and me
[1:55:42] that i might preach him among the
[1:55:44] heathen i immediately conferred
[1:55:46] not with flesh and blood neither went i
[1:55:49] up to jerusalem to them that were
[1:55:50] apostles before me but i went into
[1:55:52] arabia
[1:55:53] and returned again into damascus
[1:55:57] paul never went to jerusalem but instead
[1:55:59] he went to
[1:56:00] arabia and and and and what was the
[1:56:04] purpose of it
[1:56:04] it was to search the scriptures
[1:56:07] concerning
[1:56:08] christ christ is mystery of god revealed
[1:56:12] 63 paul went down then until he got all
[1:56:15] his ecclesiastical stuff cut off of him
[1:56:17] down to the backside of the desert for
[1:56:19] three and a half years where was he
[1:56:21] he was in arabia the backside of the
[1:56:23] desert for three and a half years
[1:56:25] and he become a prisoner here we come
[1:56:27] back in chains of love
[1:56:29] all my seminary experience is gone i'm a
[1:56:32] prisoner to jesus christ amen
[1:56:34] philemon my brother i'm a prisoner of
[1:56:36] jesus christ i can only speak and say
[1:56:39] what he tells me god help us to lay
[1:56:41] aside our own thoughts and
[1:56:43] interpretations of what
[1:56:44] this prophet said and just say what he
[1:56:47] said
[1:56:47] on those tapes amen for if we all
[1:56:51] say what he said on the tapes we leave
[1:56:54] our own impersonate
[1:56:56] our own uh uh our own reasonings
[1:56:59] and our own uh knowledge out of it guess
[1:57:02] what
[1:57:02] we'd all be saying the same thing
[1:57:05] he said say what i said on those tapes
[1:57:09] hallelujah that's what i can base my
[1:57:12] doctrines off of
[1:57:15] amen
[1:57:18] i've been uh preaching a little bit on
[1:57:22] on the body and spirit and soul and and
[1:57:25] a person
[1:57:26] i got sent a little clip to me a little
[1:57:28] video and it was off
[1:57:29] this is from years and years ago i don't
[1:57:31] know how long ago but and it was of a
[1:57:33] brother
[1:57:34] and he was giving um a testimony
[1:57:38] of what another brother told him of what
[1:57:41] brother branham shared with him
[1:57:43] and um and it was nice and everything
[1:57:47] like that of what
[1:57:48] you know the carnal nature and
[1:57:50] everything and my response was
[1:57:52] this is just very interesting but i
[1:57:54] can't preach that for doctrine
[1:57:57] because he never said it on tape
[1:58:01] he said say what i say on those tapes
[1:58:06] i think that's where we can get mixed up
[1:58:07] sometimes
[1:58:09] somebody all have you ever does anybody
[1:58:11] know what chinese whispers is
[1:58:15] steven um
[1:58:18] stephen stephen uh through a
[1:58:20] three-pointer
[1:58:22] basketball that'll never happen okay
[1:58:25] but i did it stephen threw hey did you
[1:58:28] hear that
[1:58:29] steven threw a three-pointer with his
[1:58:31] eyes closed
[1:58:33] he did hey did you hear that steven
[1:58:35] threw a three-pointer with his eyes
[1:58:36] closed with his back
[1:58:38] turned to the basket and before you know
[1:58:41] chinese
[1:58:41] the story is so elevated and and
[1:58:44] everything like that to where yes
[1:58:46] stephen turner three-pointer was true
[1:58:47] but now all this other stuff is added to
[1:58:49] it
[1:58:50] i feel like that's what happens a lot of
[1:58:52] times nothing wrong with testimonies
[1:58:55] right nothing wrong with those things
[1:58:57] but one person tells it to someone
[1:58:59] and someone tells it to another person
[1:59:01] and someone tells it to another person
[1:59:03] perhaps the facts are right but there's
[1:59:05] so much added to it
[1:59:09] you can't preach it for doctrine you've
[1:59:11] got to say what he said on the
[1:59:13] i'm so thankful so thankful that this
[1:59:16] voice was recorded
[1:59:19] that we could hear it for ourselves
[1:59:21] saints of god
[1:59:25] you don't have to wait to hear it from
[1:59:27] the minister
[1:59:28] but you can hear it yourself in your own
[1:59:31] homes
[1:59:32] in the coldness of the evening when god
[1:59:35] walked through
[1:59:35] the midst of the garden we can listen in
[1:59:38] the cool of the evening
[1:59:40] with our ac on in our house
[1:59:43] and it's nice and cool we can listen to
[1:59:45] that voice
[1:59:46] that was ordained by god to turn our
[1:59:50] hearts back to the faith of the original
[1:59:52] fathers
[1:59:52] and when you come to church when you
[1:59:55] come to church
[1:59:56] and the preacher he uses a quota or he
[1:59:59] has a
[2:00:00] line of thought that he's using you can
[2:00:02] say hey man brother
[2:00:04] i believe that for i heard him say it
[2:00:06] myself
[2:00:08] why because you've been doing your
[2:00:09] homework i'm begging
[2:00:12] i don't want to just repeat what another
[2:00:13] minister says
[2:00:15] but i want to get it fresh from god
[2:00:17] myself
[2:00:19] hallelujah and then when i'm in church
[2:00:21] and i'm enjoying service
[2:00:23] and the preacher saying something and i
[2:00:24] know i've heard it before
[2:00:26] i can say amen that's the truth
[2:00:29] because i heard it on the tapes amen
[2:00:36] what was god doing to paul in the desert
[2:00:38] of arabia
[2:00:39] he was revealing himself to paul through
[2:00:41] the scriptures
[2:00:42] that jesus was the messiah what was god
[2:00:46] doing to him he was revealing himself to
[2:00:48] him
[2:00:49] later on paul was in another desert
[2:00:51] place in his life a lonely and dark
[2:00:54] place he was thrown into jail
[2:00:57] for the testimony of jesus christ and
[2:00:59] preaching in his name
[2:01:00] and it was from this jail that paul
[2:01:02] wrote much of the new testament
[2:01:04] scriptures
[2:01:05] god uses desert places to reveal his
[2:01:08] word
[2:01:09] he uses desert places to reveal himself
[2:01:12] to you
[2:01:12] to make himself known to you and he uses
[2:01:15] desert places to reveal to you his word
[2:01:18] hallelujah you know when our day has
[2:01:21] been no different brother branham
[2:01:23] ever since he was a little boy he was
[2:01:25] never satisfied with the country that he
[2:01:27] lived in
[2:01:28] and longed somehow to go west
[2:01:32] remember he always wanted to go west and
[2:01:34] even an astronomer lady told him that he
[2:01:37] would never be successful in the east
[2:01:39] but to move west within the scriptures
[2:01:43] the high priest would enter the
[2:01:45] tabernacle that would be from the east
[2:01:48] because the gate was on the east side
[2:01:51] they would enter in from the east
[2:01:53] and they would walk towards the
[2:01:54] tabernacle which was on the west
[2:01:57] he would enter into the tabernacle he
[2:01:59] would perform his duties
[2:02:01] as a high priest he would come out he
[2:02:04] would turn around from the west
[2:02:05] and he would go back to the east once
[2:02:08] again
[2:02:10] god has done something the exact same in
[2:02:12] this our day
[2:02:14] from the high priest of this church age
[2:02:16] brother branham
[2:02:18] here he was in the east he was born and
[2:02:21] he was raised in the east the tabernacle
[2:02:23] the the branham tabernacle was in the
[2:02:26] east but there was always something
[2:02:28] within him
[2:02:29] that he longed to go out west ever since
[2:02:32] he was a little boy
[2:02:33] and hear god he brought him out west
[2:02:36] what was the purpose for it
[2:02:38] it was for god to reveal himself to him
[2:02:42] to catch him up in a in a cloud in a
[2:02:45] constellation of angels
[2:02:48] that he may receive the revelation of
[2:02:50] the seven seals
[2:02:52] not that he would stay in the west but
[2:02:54] he would take that revelation
[2:02:56] and he would come out of the tabernacle
[2:03:00] where the very presence of god was he
[2:03:03] would come from the west back to the
[2:03:04] east
[2:03:05] and he would preach the revelation of
[2:03:07] the seven seals
[2:03:10] my god makes no mistakes
[2:03:14] the seventh seal because before we even
[2:03:17] went into it and i left to go west the
[2:03:19] lord showed me a vision one day
[2:03:21] about ten o'clock one morning and i come
[2:03:23] and explained it here
[2:03:25] that i had seen it you know i you know
[2:03:28] that's one of the things i really love
[2:03:29] about brother branham
[2:03:31] when he when he's seen something or he
[2:03:33] had a vision
[2:03:34] he told us about it he didn't wait for
[2:03:37] it to come to pass and then tell us well
[2:03:38] i told you so
[2:03:41] he really threw it out there he's like i
[2:03:42] i've had this vision and this is going
[2:03:44] to happen and i'm going to go west and
[2:03:46] this is going to happen
[2:03:47] and months later however long it was it
[2:03:49] actually happened
[2:03:51] it's not like people nowadays they have
[2:03:53] a dream they have a thought they have
[2:03:55] something
[2:03:55] they put it on youtube and they wait for
[2:03:58] the thing to happen first
[2:04:00] yeah yeah it happened i had a dream
[2:04:02] about this three years ago
[2:04:04] oh praise the lord why didn't you tell
[2:04:06] us three years ago about the dream
[2:04:09] you know what i mean that's one thing
[2:04:11] about brother branham
[2:04:13] he didn't wait until it happened
[2:04:16] but he seen the vision he had the dream
[2:04:18] he told it
[2:04:20] and then it came to pass yeah
[2:04:26] uh didn't know what it was it was a
[2:04:28] constellation of seven angels remember
[2:04:30] that
[2:04:30] you'll get it on tape what time is it
[2:04:32] sir well now
[2:04:34] that is exactly what you're seeing now
[2:04:36] the seven angels i was in the west
[2:04:39] you remember the little bitty messengers
[2:04:41] they went east
[2:04:42] the second messengers the doves a little
[2:04:44] bit larger bird
[2:04:45] they went east then they was
[2:04:48] they was with me all the time
[2:04:52] that was the first and second pool
[2:04:56] now the third came from the west
[2:04:59] sweeping forward with great terrific
[2:05:02] speed and they picked me up
[2:05:04] that was coming back east with the
[2:05:06] mystery
[2:05:07] of the seven seals just like it said in
[2:05:10] junior jackson's dream
[2:05:12] that the lord let me interpret for him
[2:05:13] there on the
[2:05:15] inside of that pyramid there was white
[2:05:17] stone
[2:05:18] that wasn't written on that's the reason
[2:05:20] i had to go west
[2:05:21] to connect with these angels message to
[2:05:24] come back here to reveal it to the
[2:05:26] church
[2:05:27] so he went from east to west
[2:05:30] back to east again the next things that
[2:05:33] will happen
[2:05:34] will be here at the church that's just
[2:05:35] exactly
[2:05:37] hallelujah the anointed ones at the end
[2:05:40] time
[2:05:41] notice the very day this messenger not
[2:05:44] when he starts on
[2:05:45] but when he begins to declare his
[2:05:47] message see
[2:05:48] the first pull healing remember
[2:05:52] say what he said on the tapes second
[2:05:55] pull
[2:05:56] prophesying third pull the opening of
[2:05:59] the word
[2:06:00] the mystery is revealed no more there is
[2:06:03] no more higher
[2:06:04] order to reveal the word than prophets
[2:06:06] but the only way the prophet can be
[2:06:08] vindicated is by the word
[2:06:10] and remember the third pool was the
[2:06:13] opening of them seven seals
[2:06:16] to reveal the hidden truth that's been
[2:06:18] sealed in the word
[2:06:20] do you see it what was god doing with
[2:06:24] brother branham in the desert of arizona
[2:06:27] just the same as what he was doing with
[2:06:29] moses and paul
[2:06:30] he was giving him the revelation of the
[2:06:32] word for the day in which we live
[2:06:34] three years he was in tucson and not one
[2:06:36] church invited him to preach
[2:06:38] except for brother perry started the
[2:06:40] church here brother perry greene
[2:06:42] and brother branham i believe he
[2:06:43] preached here and he dedicated the
[2:06:45] church and everything right
[2:06:47] doors were closing
[2:06:50] here he is in the apex of his ministry
[2:06:54] there's no higher order than the
[2:06:56] revealing of the word to prophets
[2:06:58] here's god revealing his word to him
[2:07:01] third poll ministry
[2:07:02] the mysteries that had been hid since
[2:07:05] before the foundations of the world
[2:07:07] whom god had never shared with before
[2:07:12] god had never shared these mysteries
[2:07:13] before sure john
[2:07:15] wrote them john seen it but he's seen it
[2:07:18] in symbol form
[2:07:20] he didn't understand it he just saw the
[2:07:23] symbols and he wrote what he saw
[2:07:25] but here was god almighty this is why
[2:07:28] the cloud experience my brother my
[2:07:30] sister
[2:07:30] is so important for the believer because
[2:07:33] it was
[2:07:34] god revealing their very thoughts
[2:07:37] that have been hidden since the
[2:07:39] foundations of the world these mysteries
[2:07:41] that no one knew
[2:07:42] anything about he was caught up into
[2:07:44] this thought
[2:07:45] caught up into the mind of god and now
[2:07:48] it was being revealed
[2:07:50] something that was never revealed before
[2:07:53] what was god doing through this cloud
[2:07:55] experience
[2:07:56] he was circumcising away the the flesh
[2:08:00] and the intellects of man
[2:08:03] remember brother branham way in his
[2:08:05] early ministry he preached the seals
[2:08:08] he says oh my goodness i was a million
[2:08:10] miles away from the truth
[2:08:13] why because he read books like uh
[2:08:16] clarence larkin
[2:08:17] his his slops to babylon and and all
[2:08:20] these
[2:08:20] and all these different men that that
[2:08:22] were very intellectual and
[2:08:24] and scholars of the day they said well
[2:08:26] that sounds pretty good
[2:08:28] perhaps i'll just preach it again along
[2:08:31] those
[2:08:31] same kind of lines and he says and then
[2:08:33] something happened in the room
[2:08:36] god met him he took away
[2:08:39] the carnal intellects of man and now he
[2:08:42] was receiving
[2:08:43] the very mind of god where would it
[2:08:47] where did it happen in a desert place
[2:08:52] hallelujah
[2:08:55] that's what god has to do to us
[2:08:56] sometimes he has to get us in a desert
[2:08:59] place where it feels like we are all
[2:09:01] alone
[2:09:02] we have no friends we don't get invited
[2:09:04] to places
[2:09:09] have you ever you ever been there
[2:09:12] feels like everybody else gets invited
[2:09:13] to something and you don't
[2:09:16] seems like everybody else gets their
[2:09:18] hands shaken but you don't
[2:09:21] you're in a group have you ever felt
[2:09:23] alone in a big church
[2:09:26] how many people's here 60 people i don't
[2:09:28] know
[2:09:29] i ever been in a congregation this size
[2:09:33] where it feels like man we should have
[2:09:35] tons of friends and
[2:09:37] and this and that but yet you feel alone
[2:09:40] you feel by yourself
[2:09:42] no one shakes your hands you don't get
[2:09:44] invited to this you don't go there and
[2:09:46] and well i i just don't fit in and
[2:09:49] therefore i just i just don't belong
[2:09:51] there so guess what
[2:09:53] i'm out saints of god is just a season
[2:09:57] we all go through seasons in our lives
[2:10:00] perhaps you're in a desert place
[2:10:02] season in your life of a desert place at
[2:10:05] the minute at the moment
[2:10:06] but understand god uses it for a purpose
[2:10:11] so don't pick up your bags and run off
[2:10:14] but just stay put because the changes
[2:10:17] they change don't they
[2:10:19] yeah yeah and there will be a time where
[2:10:22] you know what in your life you'll be
[2:10:23] like man
[2:10:24] everybody likes me everybody wants to
[2:10:26] shake my hand
[2:10:28] everybody's laughing at my jokes feels
[2:10:31] pretty good
[2:10:33] seasons change amen
[2:10:37] some simple analogies but it's things we
[2:10:39] can all relate to huh
[2:10:44] now i'll try to come to a close here
[2:10:50] but what's the purpose for it when god
[2:10:52] gets us to that place
[2:10:54] notice paul didn't confer with flesh and
[2:10:57] blood
[2:10:57] but he took himself off to meet god in a
[2:11:00] desert
[2:11:01] place whenever you feel like you're in a
[2:11:05] desert place
[2:11:06] seek the mind of god
[2:11:10] because he wants you by yourself you
[2:11:12] might be by yourself but you're never
[2:11:14] alone
[2:11:15] because he said he will never leave us
[2:11:17] nor will he forsake us
[2:11:20] it's a good time to seek his face
[2:11:21] because he's wanting to speak to you
[2:11:23] he's wanting to meet you face to face
[2:11:25] just like paul and just like moses
[2:11:27] and he's wanting to reveal his word on
[2:11:29] to you
[2:11:30] amen us throughout the scriptures
[2:11:35] wilderness our desert experiences are
[2:11:37] not always a sign that god is rebuking
[2:11:39] you
[2:11:40] but rather a time of molding and shaping
[2:11:42] your character
[2:11:44] when god had delivered israel through
[2:11:46] the red sea he led them three days into
[2:11:48] the wilderness to test their faith
[2:11:50] exodus 15 22-25
[2:11:54] so moses brought israel from the red sea
[2:11:56] and they went out in the wilderness of
[2:11:57] sure
[2:11:58] and they went three days in the
[2:12:00] wilderness and found no water
[2:12:02] and they came to uh mara
[2:12:07] and when they came to mara they could
[2:12:10] not drink of the waters of
[2:12:11] mara for they were bitter therefore the
[2:12:14] name of it was called
[2:12:16] mara and the people murmured against
[2:12:18] moses saying what shall we drink
[2:12:20] and he cried onto the lord and the lord
[2:12:22] showed him a tree
[2:12:23] shoot shooed him a tree which when he
[2:12:27] had cast into the waters
[2:12:29] the waters were made sweet there he made
[2:12:32] for them a statute
[2:12:33] and an ordinance and there he proved
[2:12:36] them
[2:12:37] what did god prove to them that he was
[2:12:39] their provider
[2:12:40] and he is all that they need it's no
[2:12:43] difference for us today
[2:12:45] what is god doing this and society and
[2:12:48] why does he perhaps take away our jobs
[2:12:50] and do all these different things to us
[2:12:52] because he wants to prove to us
[2:12:54] that he is all that we need we don't
[2:12:57] need this world's goods
[2:12:58] we don't need this world's uh pleasures
[2:13:01] and materialistic things
[2:13:03] all we need is one thing and that's god
[2:13:06] almighty it isn't a want
[2:13:09] but it's a need you understand the
[2:13:11] difference in a want and a need
[2:13:14] i want a lot of things but what i need
[2:13:18] comes first hallelujah
[2:13:21] that's what it is that's why a lot of
[2:13:23] people are broke
[2:13:24] because they get all their wants instead
[2:13:27] of just what they need
[2:13:30] we need more of christ it's not a want
[2:13:34] but it's a need for without him i can't
[2:13:36] make it
[2:13:37] without him i can't keep myself but he
[2:13:40] is the one
[2:13:41] that keeps us yeah
[2:13:47] okay i'm gonna skip a lot of this stuff
[2:13:49] here
[2:13:50] jesus himself after he was baptized he
[2:13:53] was laid into the wilderness for 40 days
[2:13:56] to be tempted of this of satan right
[2:13:58] luke 9 verses 11 and 12.
[2:14:00] and the people when they knew it
[2:14:01] followed him and he received them and
[2:14:03] spake unto them of the kingdom of god
[2:14:05] and healed them
[2:14:06] that had need of healing and when the
[2:14:08] day began to wear away
[2:14:10] then came the 12 and said on to him said
[2:14:12] send the multitude away
[2:14:14] that they may go into the towns and
[2:14:15] country roundabout
[2:14:17] and lodge and get victuals for we here
[2:14:20] are in a desert place understand jesus
[2:14:24] does things in desert places mark 6
[2:14:27] 34 and jesus when he came out saw much
[2:14:30] people and was moved with compassion
[2:14:31] towards him
[2:14:32] because they were sheep not having a
[2:14:34] shepherd and he began to teach them many
[2:14:36] things
[2:14:37] and when the day was now far spent his
[2:14:38] disciples came on to him and said
[2:14:40] this is a desert place and now the time
[2:14:43] is far past
[2:14:45] send them away that they may that they
[2:14:46] may go into a country round about
[2:14:48] and into villages and buy themselves
[2:14:51] bread for they have nothing
[2:14:53] to eat jesus would also take his
[2:14:56] disciples into a desert place
[2:14:58] that he may reveal unto them the
[2:15:00] parables
[2:15:01] that he had spoken in front of the
[2:15:03] crowds of the people
[2:15:05] you see god uses desert places in our
[2:15:08] lives
[2:15:10] it turns me again to the book of
[2:15:11] deuteronomy as the musicians come
[2:15:15] and we'll just go through this one more
[2:15:18] time here
[2:15:20] of the purpose of a desert place
[2:15:23] deuteronomy
[2:15:24] chapter 8 verse 2 and it says thou
[2:15:27] shalt remember
[2:15:31] all the way which the lord thy god laid
[2:15:33] thee these 40 years in the wilderness to
[2:15:36] humbly and to prove thee
[2:15:38] to know what was in thine heart whether
[2:15:40] thou would just keep his commandments
[2:15:42] or no what was the desert place
[2:15:45] experience for
[2:15:46] for the children of israel in verse 2 it
[2:15:49] was to humble you
[2:15:51] and it was to prove you to prove what
[2:15:54] you got in your heart
[2:15:56] verse 3 and he humbled thee
[2:16:00] and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee
[2:16:04] with manna which thou knewest not notice
[2:16:06] it was god that did it it wasn't satan
[2:16:11] you can't blame everything on the devil
[2:16:13] you know
[2:16:17] neither did thy fathers know
[2:16:21] that he might make thee know what man
[2:16:24] does not live by bread only
[2:16:26] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[2:16:28] the mouth of the lord
[2:16:29] doth man live what was the purpose for
[2:16:31] it in verse 3
[2:16:33] that man does not live by bread only but
[2:16:36] by
[2:16:37] every word that is written
[2:16:40] by the mouth of god
[2:16:44] verse 4 thy raiment wax not old upon
[2:16:47] thee
[2:16:49] neither did thy footswell these 40 years
[2:16:54] was he showing us in verse 4 that god
[2:16:58] provides
[2:16:59] all of your needs
[2:17:02] verse 5 thou shalt also consider in
[2:17:05] thine heart
[2:17:06] that as a man chasteneth his son
[2:17:09] so the lord thy god chasteneth
[2:17:12] thee it was for correction
[2:17:17] what does god put us in a desert place
[2:17:19] experience
[2:17:20] for once in a while is for correction
[2:17:25] i got to thinking on correction when i
[2:17:27] was younger
[2:17:28] in my flesh i hated getting corrected
[2:17:33] i hated getting this banking i just i
[2:17:36] just didn't enjoy it
[2:17:38] it was something that was very contrary
[2:17:40] to my
[2:17:41] young life but now that i'm a christian
[2:17:46] seems like the tables have turned and i
[2:17:47] say lord
[2:17:49] correct me when i'm wrong rebuke me when
[2:17:52] i've done something that i shouldn't
[2:17:54] have done if
[2:17:54] have reacted in a way that i shouldn't
[2:17:57] have reacted
[2:17:58] lord chasten me for it rebuke me for it
[2:18:02] bring it to my remembrance lord that i
[2:18:04] may make it right with that person
[2:18:07] and with you yeah
[2:18:10] it's amazing i never thought that i
[2:18:12] would ever say
[2:18:13] that i want to be chastened but lord
[2:18:16] chasing me
[2:18:19] verse 6
[2:18:23] therefore thou shalt keep the
[2:18:24] commandments of the lord thy god
[2:18:26] to walk in his ways and to fear him
[2:18:30] what was the purpose of it it was to
[2:18:32] learn how to walk
[2:18:33] in his ways and to fear him
[2:18:40] moses david paul brother branham and
[2:18:43] jesus himself
[2:18:44] all spent time in a desert place before
[2:18:46] god used them
[2:18:48] for something greater so it is with you
[2:18:51] and i my brother
[2:18:52] my sister perhaps god has you in a
[2:18:54] desert place because he is preparing you
[2:18:57] for something greater laying just up
[2:19:00] ahead
[2:19:02] perhaps some of you could be honest with
[2:19:04] yourselves right now and
[2:19:06] you could say you know what preacher i'm
[2:19:08] in a desert place
[2:19:11] in my flesh man and in my spiritual life
[2:19:15] perhaps you're lonely it seems like the
[2:19:16] anointing is dry
[2:19:19] it's a drag to pray it's a drag to go to
[2:19:22] church and
[2:19:24] it's a drag to read your bible and
[2:19:26] you're just going
[2:19:28] through the motions
[2:19:29] [Music]
[2:19:31] a desert place
[2:19:36] god uses desert places
[2:19:39] if you're in that spot this morning it's
[2:19:42] not always
[2:19:45] the rebuking of the lord yet sometimes
[2:19:48] it is
[2:19:50] a lot of times as believers we we try to
[2:19:52] say well i've done something wrong and
[2:19:54] this is a rebuke and
[2:19:55] it's not always the case but perhaps
[2:19:58] you're in that spot this morning and and
[2:20:02] you were wondering why
[2:20:03] you're feeling like this you were
[2:20:05] wondering
[2:20:07] why there's no anointing why
[2:20:08] everything's a drag why
[2:20:10] why why it's at times like this that
[2:20:14] satan likes to come and tell us that
[2:20:16] we're not seed
[2:20:18] that you don't belong here that this is
[2:20:20] not for you
[2:20:23] church is for everybody else everybody
[2:20:26] else
[2:20:26] always seems to be happy except for me
[2:20:33] yeah you know satan likes to put his
[2:20:36] foot on our heads when
[2:20:37] it seems like we're sinking
[2:20:42] that's when we got to reach out by faith
[2:20:45] that even when our emotions and our
[2:20:47] sensations we can't feel anything we
[2:20:49] don't see anything
[2:20:51] we have no joy we it seems like we have
[2:20:53] no
[2:20:54] life yet there's something within us by
[2:20:57] faith
[2:20:58] we say though my feelings feel like this
[2:21:02] though i don't feel anything
[2:21:06] no i don't see any things oh i don't see
[2:21:09] the hand of god in my life
[2:21:11] yet by faith i'm going to reach out not
[2:21:14] by the
[2:21:15] outer man not by the inner man but from
[2:21:18] the holiest of holies
[2:21:20] from my heart i'm going to reach out and
[2:21:22] say by faith
[2:21:24] god's word says that he would be with me
[2:21:27] even in me
[2:21:28] and he said it i believe it and that
[2:21:31] does it
[2:21:32] god wants to get us away from feelings
[2:21:35] and sensations
[2:21:36] get us away from the outer courts get us
[2:21:39] away from the inner courts and he wants
[2:21:41] us to live a life
[2:21:42] a hidden life in the very presence of
[2:21:45] god
[2:21:45] in the holy of holies so why everybody
[2:21:48] why am i in this position today why am i
[2:21:51] in this wilderness experience
[2:21:55] that god might prove you that he might
[2:21:57] reveal his word to you
[2:21:59] that he might talk to you face to face
[2:22:03] that he might show you that you're not
[2:22:05] to live from bread alone
[2:22:06] but by every word that comes from the
[2:22:09] mouth of god
[2:22:10] that he might prove to you that he is
[2:22:12] all
[2:22:13] you need hallelujah because he is
[2:22:16] jehovah jarrah
[2:22:20] and so when you do get into that place
[2:22:22] in the future
[2:22:23] now you know wow that's not because
[2:22:26] i'm not seed
[2:22:29] it's not because i'm not a christian i'm
[2:22:32] just in a desert place
[2:22:34] and god is just trying to reveal himself
[2:22:36] to me he's just trying to bring me into
[2:22:38] a deeper consecration with him it's not
[2:22:41] because i'm not a christian
[2:22:43] glory because that's the first thing
[2:22:46] that satan wants to prove
[2:22:47] show us yeah it's not for you skedaddle
[2:22:51] no you skedaddle the blood is not for
[2:22:55] you
[2:22:55] hallelujah you know satan cannot be
[2:22:57] redeemed
[2:23:00] he is not redeemable
[2:23:03] because only the seed of god all right
[2:23:06] only the seed of god brother branham
[2:23:08] said are those
[2:23:10] who can be redeemed are those who can't
[2:23:13] be born again
[2:23:15] amen praise the lord let's just bow our
[2:23:17] heads for a word of prayer

[2:23:53] realize
[2:23:54] father that you haven't indeed left us
[2:23:58] but father god that you're right there
[2:24:00] in the midst of the darkness you're
[2:24:02] there
[2:24:04] and that you're trying to show us that
[2:24:06] we're not to go
[2:24:07] by feelings are the sensations of man
[2:24:10] but we're supposed to walk by faith
[2:24:14] lord i just commit this sermon into your
[2:24:17] hands and
[2:24:18] i pray that your perfect will was done i
[2:24:21] commit these people in their lives
[2:24:23] your sons and your daughters into your
[2:24:26] hands lord

[2:25:21] lord hear my prayers to sing it again
[2:25:37] yes
[2:25:38] [Music]
[2:25:49] [Music]
[2:26:18] my
[2:26:23] [Music]
[2:26:28] if you would want to everybody with
[2:26:29] their eyes closed nobody paying
[2:26:31] attention
[2:26:33] raised my hand and said i'm going
[2:26:35] through a desert place right now in my
[2:26:36] life
[2:26:39] things look dry things look hard
[2:26:44] it makes me wonder sometimes but we've
[2:26:47] heard from the lord today
[2:26:49] that you're in a desert place for a
[2:26:51] reason
[2:26:52] and that's because he loves you and he
[2:26:55] wants to bring his will
[2:26:56] in your life take you to a place maybe
[2:27:00] that you've
[2:27:01] you've always thought other christians
[2:27:02] were there but you've never been able to
[2:27:04] be
[2:27:05] but god wants to take you there too
[2:27:08] and i could say to this to you today
[2:27:11] your redemption draws nigh
[2:27:14] when god draws night to you it's and he
[2:27:16] pulls you into a desert place
[2:27:19] and things look that way it's because he
[2:27:22] loves you
[2:27:23] and he cares for you you're part of him
[2:27:26] he wants to nourish that part he wants
[2:27:28] to bring the life
[2:27:29] out in that part maybe you would raise
[2:27:31] your hand and say i'm in that place
[2:27:33] right now lord
[2:27:35] remind me let it come dear to my heart
[2:27:38] lord that you're mindful of me and you
[2:27:40] care for me lord
[2:27:42] and i want to take a moment to say thank
[2:27:44] you lord for being mindful of me
[2:27:47] and caring for me lord when it seems
[2:27:50] that others are being blessed and i
[2:27:52] wasn't lord it's because you have
[2:27:54] you have me there for a reason and a
[2:27:55] purpose and
[2:27:57] everything you do lord is perfect and
[2:28:00] everything comes
[2:28:00] is accomplished as you said every seed
[2:28:03] will bring forth of its kind
