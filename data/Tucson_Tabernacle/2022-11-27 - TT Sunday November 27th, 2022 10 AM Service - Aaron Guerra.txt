fine and it's been fine but I know how it is so let's just go to the Lord in prayer for this need and I'm sure each one of us has a need that we would make with an uplifted hand unspoken request Lord yes okay [Music] sister Bonnie Marriott broke her hip she had surgery and she's doing well but just pray for healing there brother Ed's dad I believe was in the hospital earlier this week had it maybe

one more time consume me Lord concert me Lord with the fire of your spirit concert me Lord and make me more like thee Break Me Lord and bless the broken pieces of my life let me be you Lord by you amen you may be seated this morning [Music] when life lets you down you feel more broken than home when the wounds go deeper than words and you can't tell a soul I may not know what you're going through may not could make that highment and move but one thing I felt that I really want you to know if it matters to you it matters to the master has to share the burdens you bear whisper peace when your world gets shattered if it's your greatest joy or your deepest pain or you're really needing an answer if it matters to you it matters to the master friend do you think the maker and Giver of Life far too busy to care about your trouble and try he sees the spare that falls to the ground and he hears the tears that don't make a sound if only you knew how precious you are in his sight if it matters to you it matters to the master he wants to share the burdens you bear whisper peace when the world gets shattered if it's your name is [Music] [Applause] [Music] if it's your greatest joy or your deepest pain or you're really needing an answer if it matters to you it doesn't only matter to you if it matters to you it matters to the master [Music] [Applause] it matters to the master amen stand this morning turn the service over to brother Aaron sing Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound he saved a Wretch like us amen [Music] um everyone just sing it out foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] how proud precious did that Grace appears [Applause] I first believed through many dangers through many days just tore and snares I have already [Music] [Applause] it is [Music] [Applause] [Music] 10 [Music] 000 years [Music] to sing God's praise that when we first let's do that verse one more time when we've been there ten thousand s [Music] rise good with no distance to sing God's praise [Music] be gone now let's Praise Him praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise praise God praise God praise God [Music] amen he's worthy of all praise appreciate that and you may be seated I'm I'm tempted to call them back up to sing that again sister Martha but and you'll understand why in a bit um I have three sermons and I'm not sure which one to start with to go in the middle and to finish with until that song was sung and and then now you understand and those of you who have had ministered and have prepared you've stood behind the door or wherever and you wondered is this what I should Minister on today sometimes you know it's exactly what you should Minister sometimes you've got questions and um but when they began to sing that I said okay Lord that's what you told me to do what you impressed in my heart I believe it was Friday and I put it first and I didn't ask him to sing that song I had no idea they were going to sing it but it matters to the master it and and it's not something that he gets taken by surprise where it's like oh my I gotta go deal with this now but he's already made preparation for it so you know you put insurance on your vehicle just in case and when you buy the vehicle and you owe the insurance really is for the people you owe it to so that they get their money but he put a Blessed Assurance in our hearts because he knew we would need it and I appreciate that today so would it be too much to ask you to come up and sing it one more time what's that what'd you do because I didn't hear it clearly I just heard enough words to know that it fits so well and while they're making some preparation to sing that one more time how many enjoyed that test Ed spoke to my heart we did hear with sister Bonnie concerning the hip surgery and the report we got was the break was not at the joint and the doctor told him that because it was not at the Joint it heals better and stronger but also with Brother Sam Marriott with the the cancer I want to keep in memory and and how's your dad doing this this morning had the surgery the knee surgery brother Merle in in prayer just for recovery so things that we always want to do thank you appreciate that [Music] when life lets you down and you feel more broken than whole when the wounds go deeper than words and you can't tell a soul I may not know what you're going through may not could make that high mountain move but one thing I found that I really want you to know if it matters to you it matters to the master he wants to share the burden to bear whisper please [Music] friend do you think the maker and Giver of Life is far too busy to care about your trouble and try try that falls to the ground he hears the tears that don't make a sound if only you knew how precious you are in his sight if it matters to you it matters to the master he wants to share the burden to bear Christmas [Music] pain or you're really needing an answer if it matters to you it matters to the master if it's your greatest joy or your deepest pain or you're really needing an answer if it matters to you it doesn't only matter to you if it matters to you it matters to the master foreign [Applause] thank you now maybe in a couple of years Kenneth can sing with him too that would be all right so you love the Lord this morning it's been good to you how many times he's done something you're not even aware that he's taken care of and then you say how did that come through but appreciate that show just a couple of updates spoke with brother Bobby words about Harmony January 11th through the 15th here at the Tabernacle and also there's going to be what they call the ministers meeting but brother Joe brother Steve Robson called and said let's make it a men's meeting here at the Tabernacle I believe it'll be on Saturday and then December 15th through the 18th here with brother Joe Adams and brother Aaron Oglesby having the meetings here at the Tabernacle show December 11th the after the morning service the memorial for brother Robert Chacon here at the church don't know the exact time it'll be after the morning service and then next not this yes this coming Sunday the fourth we're going to make some announcements concerning the meeting we've had as a pastorship and and all that to the congregation that uh brother Dan Evans brother Peter McFadden myself fill that in our hearts what what to present to you to the congregation and I know there's been a lot of questions and a lot of been a lot of wondering but um so you keep this week in prayer that the Lord would would lead us and guide us in the right direction he has he's never left us alone and I'm glad he doesn't do everything the way we want it but he does what's best and you'll understand that a little bit more this morning show I would I opened scripture of the day I guess it was Friday and I read it in you get it on your phone you get it on your computer maybe different things and and you you read scripture the day and and hopefully that's not the only scripture you read but there's it's a way to start the day it's it's maybe while I'm driving I'll do not read it I'll listen to it and and things like that and just just an encouraging way to start the day and I don't know how many times it's been many a times I've had a question of wondering and the scripture of the day answers it something or maybe something you hear brother banham say or maybe somebody shares something with you what means them and it's just an answer so the scripture was found in in Mark and you may you may stay seated chapter nine and we're going to read verses 17 to 26. but if you if you start and look in in chapter 9 it's the mount Transfiguration experience when Jesus Takes you know the two disciples up with him and they watch what happens in Moses and Elijah come up and and Peter speaks out and says let's make three Tabernacles and and it does tell you in the scripture that Peter just didn't know what to say didn't know what to think and we've all been in a situation where where something happens and we're at loss of words and maybe sometimes it would just be best if we didn't say something but we feel we need to say something and we do and then you wonder why did I say that you know but the scripture says that the cloud covered Moses and Elijah and just Jesus was showing and says hear ye him and and so if you read that first part of it Jesus is talking with them and it makes you kind of wonder how the how they were feeling about that time you know Peter saying I did it again boy if I could just learn to hold my my and not speak out so quickly um you know it as hard as it is to believe sometimes they were just like us they needed a redeemer they needed a savior they needed salvation they needed help and I'm glad it was recorded in the scriptures and and so as if going further along and even at the end of Mark chapter 9 Jesus has to rebuke them because they're disgusting amongst themselves who's going to be the greatest of all we'd love it if if the Lord would come and he would meet with us and and he would share his glory with us and then after that one time we'd never had an issue or a problem again but no we continue being human we continue with our daily struggles and and and you know as many times as I've said Lord you know I love you and I love you with all my heart and then I began to question again I Love You Lord but why this and why that I know you have my best interest in mind it matters to the master but then I question why this Lord so the scripture of the day was here out of Mark nine but I want to go start from verse 17. and we'll go to verse 26 and I was reading the scripture and I turned to my wife in in the in the room and and I said it's a natural healing of a Young Man but I said couldn't we apply that scripture to every portion of our life and I was thinking this whole time is is that how you want me to go Lord because I've got something else and I've got something else too and then they sang that song it matters to the master and I said I was crying back there happy for them but they didn't know but thanking the Lord because I felt he put his heart but I still question him so so what and and as this the Jesus and disciple are coming through and and there's a multitude and and the Pharisees and them around there and and this is after this he sees this and then and Jesus asked a question and one of the multitude answers said master I have brought unto thee my son which has a dumb Spirit he says and and sometimes just was my thinking I said is there any Spirit that's smart outside of the spirit of God but I know that word doesn't mean that but Satan just likes to mix everything up and tear things apart and I you know we know it means not the ability to speak but I said if it's not the spirit of Christ it's a dumb spirit if it don't yield itself and and we won't and we're in the same condition if we won't yield ourselves to him and let him have his way and and sometimes how many times we have said why did I do that why did I go why didn't I listen you know and it's it's it's uh what is it um hindsight is 2020 I believe they say and wheresoever he take of him he teareth him and he's speaking to the spirit in it in this child and he fell with and he gnashes with his teeth and and pineth away and I spoke to thy disciples that they could cast him out and they could not so we could take this just as a a written story of what happened with the disciples or we could look at it closely in our own lives how many things have you struggled with you've prayed over and you just can't seem to get over it or is it just me sometimes no I think it's all of us we battle things we go things in life and this is I begin to share this with my wife I said could we turn and just look at ourselves and see a similarity here but it matters to the master and um so and he answered them and saith o faithless generation how long shall I be with you how long shall I suffer you bring him unto me and this is where it spoke to me why don't you give it to me rather than battling it yourself fighting through it yourself trying to figure it out trying to work it out why don't you give it to God that's for me too maybe before me more than anybody else he says and they brought him unto him and when he saw him straightway the spirit tear him and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming watch what begins to happen when you begin to approach god with your problems Satan tries his best to Magnify Him make it harder you don't sleep that night you have more problems this begins to happen because he knows he's about to be challenged he knows he's about to be cast out how you understand and so he begins to battle and he asked the father how long and this is again in the word spoke how long is it ago that since this came unto him and he said of a child how long will you battle with us how long will you struggle with this how long will you be too embarrassed to say I have a problem I need some help how many times the symptoms of the sickness of a whatever it might be finally your wife your dad your husband somebody says let's go to the doctor let's go find out what's causing it and and sometimes if it's if you're lucky you get to see the doctor right away you may get a call we can't see you for two more months we got to schedule you for this or you can come in and we'll we'll just get a general overview and then we'll schedule you back in when there's time we've got to do some x-rays we got to do these tests and it might be three more months before you really know what's going on but when you take it to the Lord Jesus Christ and you give it to him could I say it this way it's already been resolved it's already been met the answer's already been taken everything you have native has already been supplied and there's not a busy line you know we were we were at the motor vehicle one time and I haven't been there in quite some time because you sit at your desk and take care of a lot of stuff online quickly now the one the first times we went to get uh my brother had had bought a new a car and and I went with him to go get the everything changed over and we were there about five hours because they have five windows and two people working on him you go to this window and you get this done how many remember it when it was that way you know and then they say now go to window number seven and you're number 25 and you'll go next and they say now calling number three we sat there for five hours to get about 15 minutes worth of work done because that's how it was today you punch it in the computer you print it out and you got it in your hands but it it was so so here you you hold on to it for a long time and then you give it finally you get to the point where you say I'm going to give it to God and then God answers it and you say why did I take so long to give it to God he says uh and he said of a child since he was just a little one I don't know how old this this boy was but as just a little child he's had this problem and oftentimes it casts them into the fire and into the waters to destroy him but here is this is what he said but if Falcons do anything have compassion on us and help us you know and I'll just say it say it this way we do it is maybe between Mom and Dad when you're growing up and even if you've gotten older even after you're married you wanted you needed some help and you went and you you kind of talked to him real nice hey Dad the yard looks really good I like the way you cleaned it up you know and you wash the car and that's a nice tire wearing that and Dad just saying you're going to ask me or you're not going to ask me you know and we kind of butter him up and he knows what's coming and and you know why not just go talk to the master he said you're welcome to come in you can enter into his presence I I had an experience I was off Wednesday through tomorrow I got extended time off and I believe it was Thursday night maybe I I was just I woke well it was early in the morning woke up about three or four in the morning couldn't sleep and I just went to the living room and I my wife said you okay I said yeah I said I'm just I'm gonna go to the living room and just talk to the Lord and sometimes it takes a while to get yourself to where you feel like you can talk to the Lord I don't know if you've ever struggled through that because you begin to look at yourself you began to look at your thoughts you begin to look at what you get and you say oh I'm not worthy to approach him you would never will be worthy to approach him on your own but he made a way for you to come in that's through the shed blood there was a preparation for the high priest and it was a very very detailed preparation for the high priest to enter into the holy of holies you know how important it was for the high priest to be able to enter into the holy of holies if he was not able to enter in then the sins of the people were not forgiven for that year they were not rolled over that's how important it was it mattered to the whole congregation whether he got in or not suddenly so I nailed down to pray about four in the morning and I just said Lord I just need to talk with you this morning and and and he just took me right to that scene and he said you don't have to worry about it it's already been met come on in to the holy of holies and instead of having to be there for 15 hours trying to make everything right trying to get ready trying to get and he just said come on in you're my son I'm willing to talk with you it didn't take an hour it took about five minutes for him to answer and resolve and he said you can go back to sleep now it'll be all right I laid down and I woke up about four hours later at rest God can answer quickly away has been made for you to get into his presence just come and say Lord I'm sorry put it under the blood and let me come into your presence and if you think you desire that Fellowship he desires it a whole lot more if he didn't desire that Fellowship he wouldn't say not my will but thy will be done father but he knew what that would bring in you so he says if Falcons do anything have compassion on us and help us Jesus said unto him if thou can't believe all things are possible to him that believeth all things are possible that you must believe sometimes in our in our belief in in getting to that point we began to look at ourselves Lord if I really believed you I would never do that Lord if I really and we begin to put reasons why we can't get into his presence it's not based on your ability to purify yourself make yourself holy make yourself presentable how could your righteousness ever compare to God's righteousness he made the way he paved the way he provided the way but this is what he answered if thou can'tst believe all things are possible Lord I accept what you've done and I believe I can come on in into your presence and I can receive of you what I have native and it's not just for somebody who has served the Lord their whole life or more it's for that sinner they'll say I'm sorry forgive me doesn't take much longer than that you know the the a lot of the churches in organizations and dominations now they give us a list of things that you must do to get to this point it's it's how they work but the grace of God is simply that the grace of God his Mercy that endureth forever and you know the the the thing is when we we cry out to him and we say how how am I unbelief and and how many times has God done something for you and you just know it was God there's no other explanation there's no there's no coincidence there's no by accident that was God I'll testify to that that I'll say amen that's nothing but the truth is if thou can't believe and sometimes we have to encourage ourselves brother random talks about that he's just Satan just talking to him he said what about that and what about that and accusations and then he would have to bring back to his memory then what about that healing and what about this miracle that took place and what about that part in my life and who and he said I'd re-encourage myself that's God and he hasn't left me he's still with me you know and and he says and straightway the father of child cried out and said with tears Lord I believe help thou mine unbelief the reason that's put in the scripture is so we can get something from it so we can encourage you so we can use it when we have need of it how thou my unbelief and God's got ways to do that from as simple as that song today when you're questioning is this right is this right and in as many times as God does that I still ask him again can you show me one more time and and I he's a patient loving father is a caring father he does and he says one more time one more time but he expects some growth out of us uh you know it's it's that I I remember this often and um I have an older brother and the uh the ice cream truck used to come down the street and you'd hear it and as a kid all right you know the ice cream trucks can we get can we get it get some money so I um I turned around and and we're all excited because Here Comes yeah I said so my older brother says go ask Dad for some money and that was a lot 25 cents got each one of us an ice cream all of us for 125 cent piece so yeah that goes back a ways and I don't mean this to to to make my dad to embarrass something but I come running up to the door and then I go Daddy because I want my my older brother sends me to go ask Dad and my dad just said no from the door hey dads do that often so quickly I said um is my brother Fred inside the house the one that sent me to go get the ice cream you know the fear the the what do I do now we're human we react that way but he says if thou can't believe all things are possible he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I change not he says in in he's made the way for us to be able to go it's one of those things that we look at ourselves too often we we we look and say well I'm not worthy Lord when will you be worthy what could you present to him to make yourself worthy nothing but what makes him proud or could I use that word what what pleases him is will you will take what he's done for you accept it and walk in it it's hard to receive a gift unless you're one of those that just likes to receive the honest truth that it's hard to receive a gift without thinking now I owe but a gift is a gift you know I if you give somebody something with the intention of just to please them and their thought is now I owe that back if you have to pay for the gift then it's no longer a gift you earned it you deserved it you paid for it you've met the price but if it's given freely with no strings attached like what he did for us it pleases the father it pleases God when you will by faith accept it and take it you know in in its to us then what what if we could understand that is just to be thankful and just to be grateful and say Lord I love you for that I thank you for that for what you've done for me and and then in in our place then we would say now I want to live a life worthy of the Gospel I want to share this gift with somebody else as I was freely received I'll freely give he says so so again he he says help thou mine unbelief over and over I've said that to him Lord help me to believe help me to take this help me to accept it you know and and so and then in verse 24 and when Jesus saw the people came running together he rebuked the foul Spirit saying unto him thou dumb and deaf spirit I charged thee come out of him and enter no more into him I like that I like that he said not only come at him but you're not allowed back in either and that's how he watches over us and that's how he cares for us and the spirit cried and rent him sore and he came out of him and he was as one dead in so much that many said he is dead and and I'm maybe I'm taking a little liberty here to to take that in place to our spiritual life and I would say when all that is out when all that is gone and when I'm dead you know what a dead person you can kick him and they don't react and and when we're completely out got rid of ourselves well we've emptied and we've completely got rid of ourselves then somebody could speak about us somebody could say this if this could happen this could happen but it doesn't affect us that way anymore you know and it's hard to get to that point it's hard to get to that point but let's look at this and it just spoke to me this way and he says he says what is it that you want me to do for you and if we're not um too embarrassed if we're not too too proud of ourselves or whatever it is where would we be when he said Lord I have some problems Lord I have an issue Lord I have some things that I that I need dealt with me about you know I I if this causes me to be this way this causes me to act like this this causes a reaction this way and it's not always very nice you know and and Lord I need some help dealing with this I need some deliverance from this and so I if if I could just just apply this to our own lives this is how I felt the Lord spoke it to me just reading the scripture don't take it so much just as a miracle that happened in the scripture but what about applying this principle for your very own life saying Lord I need some help I've got an issue with something I've got a problem with something you know and if you if you ever get a chance and to speak to some of the brothers that that God has used in in in their gift and their calling hearing some of the testimonies of the things that they face with as ministers in dealing with people in in prayer lines and all the things that are exposing that come out we all have problems we all have things we deal with we are all human we still have Flesh on us but greater is he than any of those problems any of those things so I appreciate God just being so so willing to share these things with us in in reading of the scriptures and and putting your own name in there and putting yourself Lord I'm in a similar situation are you still God are you still the same yesterday today and forever and he says yes then help me help me with this we would we would think of some of these things you know um how could I say it this way the levels that we put things into this sin is worse than that sin I'm not as bad as that one remind yourself he had to go to the cross for every one of them there is not one sin greater than another sin everyone causes death in the shedding of his blood you know if if there was then then he would say okay my blood plus this amount of works for that one and my blood plus this amount of works for this one but Jesus Paid It All all to him I owe now his disciples we know his disciples had prayed and they asked Him Father they asked him Jesus how come we could not cast that one out and he did he did make a statement this was this comes out by prayer and fasting and the one thing that the brother Ram told us we could never pray enough and you know that it is a battle to pray because Satan knows that when you get to praying and you get to God he's in a real battle so he's going to he's going to interrupt it every way he can fasting and there's two things to fasting two sides there are those who fast will fast and Fast and fast because they believe when they're done fasting they have through their work of fasting drawing them closer to God fasting in that sense is not drawing you close to your God because then it's a work fasting in the sense Lord I'm humbling myself I'm setting myself away I'm taking and I'm not meeting my own needs at this time but rather making myself available to you it pleases the Lord and prayer prayer time and and for the longest time prayer to so many means nailing down somewhere and being in a specific place for prayer but you can pray all the time you can have an attitude of Prayer in your heart all the time you can speak to God all the time you know we have one of these now and we even carry it to the pulpit now because it's a whole lot easier to read this than that clock back there but it's it's constant I can call my wife I can hear this I can do this it's constant we have that ability when before you had to go well when we got married we didn't have a film didn't have a house phone there wasn't a cell phone there were phones we just didn't have one okay I'm not saying we were married that long ago there were no faults no don't take it that way but our neighbor had a phone and so we made we made an agreement that in an emergency we could use the phone and also in that agreement was that if she was an older lady lived by herself that if she needed any help I would go over and do so I'd go fix something for her whatever so we had the use of a an emergency phone and you know what we lived without a phone we survived but today and I know I'm not the only one we're all sitting at the dinner table and our phone is right next to the plate am I the only one that's probably a lot of us that way you know but even closer than that is one who said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you you can call on my name and I will answer there's never a busy signal and at the end of the month there's not a bill due Jesus Paid It all all to him I owe but I would dare to say we talked through this one more than we talked to him you know but just a moment's prayer just breathing his name say Lord Jesus I need some help he's always there when he says this one comes with fasting in prayer setting aside of time for him instead of for yourself fasting that way first thing we think of fasting is no food what about fasting of things that occupy our time and I'm guilty I don't stand up here as one that doesn't have those problems I'm just telling you the things we go through in life and and some of it is necessary but not all of it it's okay to have a good time it's okay to have good Fellowship but dedicate some time I've thought of it this way he asked 10 percent 24-hour day that's two hours and 40 minutes 365 days in the year that's 36.5 days just that's just 10 in a year that doesn't sound like a whole lot but neither is two hours and 40 minutes in a day because you can spend that time quickly giving it to you I I may be wrong in those comparisons but those are just comparisons that I've made giving him more time that way because he gave it all already and he has all the Time in the World to be with you there's not a busy signal there's not a okay now survey number three I'm sorry the Lord just sent me a text message saying I'm sorry we're there and he said but I can't get to you till next Thursday that's never happened God is present he's a very present help in the time of trouble if it matters to you it matters to the master he has his reasons for doing the things that he does in the time he does it I need patience Lord and he says okay we'll work on that I need to be a little bit more like you then we'll work on that too and he has ways to work on that he understands where your weaknesses where you're where the parts you struggle struggle through and he knows how to deal with that I worked in in my senior year in high school I did a uh one semester of working with some some some of the kids in the in the lower grades I think they were seventh eighth grade who had trouble reading and um they were reading second grade level third grade level so at that point it's pretty hard to comprehend and go forward with what's required in the eighth grade so there was four or five of us from the high school working with this class and there was five boys one of them was a migrant student so he was only in school a short time short time so he never got a good learning basis the other ones had had not learned to read and and for whatever reason and and rather the teachers not having not wanting to deal with it they would just pass them on to the next grade so now here they are in eighth grade and reading about second grade level math let's go uh reading ability which means you comprehend very little at dating but I still remember that I would get called sir and to me I wasn't sure yet that's that's for an older respected gentleman you know but I was older than them and I was Sir and it caught my attention and we work with them for one semester where those boys would open a book and if it had pictures they would go through the book if it was just words they'd close it because they couldn't read couldn't understand it but we worked with them for for a full semester and at the end most of those boys were around sixth grade getting into seventh grade reading levels and to watch the joy in them the smiles in their faces when they opened a book and begin to read and follow the story how happy it made them I still remember the joy it brought me that I was able to help some kids learn to read and not just look at the pictures that they called me sir which I thought oh that went to an older person maybe now I could get called sir but if the joy of watching them grow as they begin to be began to read and understand their whole world opened up because now they could read directions on how to do something get to somewhere now they could read the plot of the story not just by the picture and when you begin to grow in God and You Begin not only to just see the picture or the Simplicity but God himself in it what a change that makes in your life and to be able to help someone get to that point what a joy that brings to your life to watch someone give their heart to God and begin to learn of him themselves what a joy that brings into your heart this is what Jesus was teaching the disciples as you read through that Mark that chapter nine there's four or five different experiences he tells them this one comes by fasting in prayer over here he had just told them oh God tells them hear ye him take your eyes off everything else put your attention on what God is doing today and the very last part of Mark 9 they're arguing amongst themselves is who's going to be the greatest and Jesus says unless you become as a little child he said trusting Believing on your father you know there was a time when there was my dad could conquer and take care of everything just take him to that he could solve it he could fix it he could we were children dad was bigger he was tougher you know he could he could lift a lot of weight he could do no wrong and as time grew up we realized dad was human too he gave it his best he did all again now as my dad got to the age now we're realizing that we're there to help them we're aware that is important it was hard here when my dad was in the hospital just not too long ago with covid that he couldn't get out of bed by himself I had never seen that of my dad but I was there to help him hold bring him up get him up walk him over to the men's room whatever whatever we needed to do that's what we are for one another we've grown we've learned these things let us put our our shoulder to the wheel let us help one another Jesus I don't know but that's how I saw this whole chapter God sharing with us experiences in life and he said all things are possible you can believe and we we sing that song we cry out make me more like you Jesus make me more like you and he says go through the scriptures and read and see how the man grew their characters how the ladies grew their characters through the things they suffered through the trials they went through to the experiences that they learn Lord isn't can I just go down to the store and buy a box of experience no experience doesn't come that way experience comes with working sometimes I read uh articles or things where uh things that have happened with folks who are very knowledgeable in their in what they do you know um and I I I remember a lot brother Mike Yarbrough and brother Lyle Johnson just very experienced in what they do because it's it's what they're lifeless but two men that never stood up and say look at me you got to be like me you got they treated us they treated me like we're brother brother John um while Johnson still does and I tell you what I did that one time with them I walked up to them both of them it would probably be like going in with brother Dan in one ear when you're teaching or you're working with you and you guys would be talking another language I wouldn't understand half of what you're saying and what you do and I just looked at him and I said it this way and I said you know I could not recommend either one of your brains to anybody fine you talk about them stopping fast they just stopped and looked at me like what are you talking about I said but mine would get top dollar that really got their attention and I said look at you too brains that are so used millions and millions and millions of miles of usage on your brains and mine's still in the original package hasn't even been opened yet it's an original 59 model worth a lot of money and they both caught what I said I was jealous of them but you know that which you have put to use give it for others let others know of the love of God and what God has done in your life share it with others give it to others don't keep it in a box don't keep it for a rainy day give unto others this is what he says give do unto others as you would have them do unto yourself these are Lessons Learned in the scriptures these are why there was scriptures written so that we could learn through the things that God had done through others and sometimes we do have to crowd help thou May unbelief this other part I didn't give to the brothers it was just something that I I read here there was a man his name was job and and and you know he uh he goes he's before the Lord the Lord even boasts of job have thou have you considered my servant job and you know who he's talking to he's talking to Satan when he tells him this because Satan's up there and and he says Where Have You Been he says I've been wandering to and fro and he says well have you considered my servant job how many would would love to get to a point where God would say that about you I didn't see a single hand come up for that one but you know it takes a character a real character to get to that place where God would say that about you and so he asked him I think he goes well so here and job uh chapter 1 verse 10 and I I didn't give this but you could you could find that there brother Matt he says and just look at him but Satan answers it this way hast thou not made in hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side thou has blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land well that sounds like a child that God's taken care of doesn't it sometimes we get to complaining a little bit but God's been so good to us no question he says you know and and this is just something that I was reading this was a scripture based but that says in certain countries around the world people use a hedge to protect their homes from the wild animals or Intruders most people use a large fence nowadays and in ancient times it was the same concept a hedge repels what is outside and protects what is on inside and that's the truth we hedge ourselves by the word of God in the spiritual and and and but even more so than the word word of God is God's promise that he would abide in you he said I'll pour out my spirit upon him I'll live in them and he says and one day he says when the Lord asked Satan about his servant job Satan said of course he is perfect you have a hedge around him Satan was frustrated that God put such a strong hedge of protection around job's family wealth and personal being was it just for job no it's for every child of God as for part of the family of God God Hedges you he puts that around you but then you're a Target you know if you go and if if you go down the road intending to Rob someone because there are people that do that and you walk around and you look and you see this old beat up junky core that's barely running tires are bald half the one it's probably not the car you want to break into you probably don't have to break into somebody probably already done it a few times but the car that looks nice well kept and everything your first thought is oh there's got to be something good in there right same thing with the house so Satan is looking around he said this house is well taken care of it's hedged it's protected I want to get in there and see what it's got you wonder why sometimes you're attacked and you have the troubles you because you got something he wants greater than all the gold in the world greater than any wealth greater than any Prestige of the world you got Christ in you and he's always wanted to take him down he says of course yes perfect you have a hedge around him he says Satan was frustrated that God had put such a hedge of protection around job's family wealth and personal being God was so protecting job that Satan could not get to him God's blessings was upon job in all that his hands set to do no demon not even Satan himself could breach to protection God put around job so he went up and presented himself before God to say hey I'd like to get into him but God has confidence in his products a good salesman will let you use the product and learn a teacher learn of it yourself come to your own conclusion they won't just give you a picture and say give me the money and I'll send it to you they'll let you use it they'll let you try it they'll let you on the job site we always do that with you know you see one guy and he's using the tool and we'll ask hey how do you like that brand how do you like that I've got one I've got this brand how do you like it and we compare we've been some who have said Hey try it out for a bit brother random talks about that if he was a the salesman I believe it was that light or something like that he said I'd give it to you for a week and let you use it let you try it and then you make your decision on it you know and so so he does that with you job was a perfect and upright man but not even he had the power of the Holy the Holy Spirit like the believer today has yet he was able to stand he says if God put such a protection around job that Satan could not breach it then what will he do for you what would he do for your family if you'll give it to God and if you'll let God have preeminence and if you'll let God have first place he'll head you around and Satan has to get permission to touch you you don't put yourself outside of the Hedge and give them a free-for-all you stay behind what God has given you always ask the Lord and that I'm just reading what what this ask the Lord to lay a barrier of protection around you and your family make sure you are living the word from within just as job was doing make sure you're standing on the word when we say standing on the word not your idea but what God has said because God keeps his word it's never failing from a young man to one into his to his his dying breath God still keeps his word I I there's a testimony of a brother a fine brother I got to know and when I we met him he was a much older brother too and and and it was come to that time to get for he was at his last breath and his his wife and his daughter testified of this as he lay there in bed getting ready to cross over down to his last breath mama and and daughter were like you know talking to them said you know you haven't eaten you need to eat and and he answered this and he said I just got fed I'm not hungry and they had been watching him on the bed for three or four days and knowing he had not eaten and he said where did you get to eat and he began to call out names of those who had passed on already and he said so and so just gave me something to eat so and so just gave me some Dewey and then it dawned on Mama and daughter that Daddy was closer to that side than being on this side anymore and he and they said then they both realized this was brother Daniel Ramirez's father they said then Greek because brother Daniel had passed away already he said then greet brother Danny or my son and my brother on the other side for us and the brother crossed his legs put his arms like this breathe this last breath and crossed over oh the life of a Christian though all hella sail me I shall not be moved what a promise we have he says he will never forsake you or allow you to handle more than you can bear the Lord will place a hedge of protection around you that nothing in this world can breach Oh What A Savior oh what a God we serve Brethren I didn't brother Matt I didn't I didn't give this to you but it's from the message Hebrews chapter 4 . now haven't you had a lot of Temptations don't complain about them Rejoice God is with you he is trying to prove your faith look at job in the Old Testament when he said have you considered my servant job just a man a perfect man there is none like him on the earth oh he said sure you got him hedged up doesn't have any troubles doesn't have any worries he doesn't have any Financial burdens everything is fine he don't have any sickness any pain let me have him I'll make him curse you to your face he said he's in your hands but don't you take his life he goes to the master seal and says what about this one what about this one you've got him so well protected but I'll show you that I can make them deny you and God says try it I'm I dare to say this God has more confidence in us and sometimes we have in him that's a that's a bold statement but sometimes we find ourselves in the Lord where are you where are you can you help me can you help me God says I've already met all your needs he says but don't take his life oh he done everything but take his life but he couldn't move job note he stood on the on the word that's right and all the Devils of Hell could not move him for he know that he had offered that sacrifice he was just job had met what God asked him to do lay a sacrifice every morning and I will honor it I will he says and they accused him and said you've sinned Joe and God is punishing you sometimes you're you're most worst owned accuser when you sit there and say oh Lord if if I really loved you I wouldn't act like this oh Lord if I you're your worst God said come up to me and just say I'm sorry I was wrong and he takes care of it it doesn't last for hours and hours of penance and do this and do this he does tell you to make things right and that should be part of our life being an honest and making things right but as quick as we confess he forgives he cleanses he washes he says and no matter what test or trials God brings you through he will never forsake you or allow you to handle more than you can bear the Lord will place a hedge of protection around you that nothing in this world can breach nothing in this world can breach he says and brother bam says we keep eating that oh he's done everything but take his life and he couldn't move job no he stood on the word that's right all the Devils Out of Hell could not move him for he know that he'd offered that sacrifice he was just and they accused him and said you you've sinned job and God is punishing he knew that God had that he hadn't sinned before God he knew that he was righteous based on what God Said not because he was a good man but because he was accepting the burnt offering in his dead when we begin to compare ourselves one to another and we become the measuring point we will have a lot of down times a lot of failures but it will take the perfect mark and compare ourselves to that and say Lord you said that I could be this and that you would make a way so make me more like you brother Jordan if you would come up make me more like you musicians and when we ask God make me more like you through the test through the trials to the things we go through then God makes us more like him he was tested he was tried to the very point of death and he never said as a human he asked the father is there another way to go through this to bring this Plan of Redemption to bring this salvation back to restore the fellowship that we had together before the world even began he said yes you'll have to give your life you will have to be that perfect sacrifice and he said as he looked it over and he thought it over and he said not my will but thy will be done everyone has to come in that place in life that says not my will but thy will be done whatever it might be yes talk to the master it does concern [Music] Lord they ask you why why couldn't we overcome this [Music] after after you had cast out that that Satan out of that young man the disciples are looking at themselves and they're they're wondering how come we couldn't do it we've had we've had other successes we've been able to do it at times but we couldn't do nothing with it so thank you father they were they were feeling low they were they were wondering where did we fail where did what is it and you told him this comes with but prayer and fasting this what comes with a dedication of setting aside of your own life and giving of yourself it's exactly how you overcame it's exactly how you were able to get come to that day on the cross and say father if it be you cried out to be thy will let this cup pass from me but nevertheless I will do thy will Lord you said you even hung on the cross and said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing Lord and for us to come to that nature to come to that same place in life Lord or we must be willing to yield and surrender all right it's a hard thing to do for us Lord the Lord just help us is our prayer Jesus name and make me more like this oh make me more like me Jesus [Music] give me [Music] one more time oh make me more like me Jesus like me give me your heart that's filled with love and make me more my queen [Music] he became who he was by how he was tested how he was tried and he overcame and we will overcome also he didn't leave us to be tested with I hope it works but he knows you will be an overcomer sure appreciate the grace of God to us remember it matters to the master thank you [Music] oh man take me home like this Jesus made me more like this oh give me a heart that's filled with love and make me more like this Jesus Paid It All [Music] Jesus Paid It All all to him [Music] left the Crimson stairs oh Jesus Paid It All oh to him
