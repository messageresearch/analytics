[5:26] And if the Sunday school, uh, you can go
[5:29] ahead and be dismissed.
[5:37] And I've had many tears and sorrows.
[5:42] I've had questions for tomorrow.
[5:47] There's been times I didn't know right
[5:50] from wrong.
[5:55] But in every situation,
[5:59] God gave me blessed consolation.
[6:03] He only gave me trials to make me
[6:07] strong.
[6:08] [Music]
[6:12] Through it all,
[6:16] through it all,
[6:20] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[6:24] I've learned to trust in God.
[6:28] Through it all,
[6:32] through it all,
[6:36] I've learned to depend upon his word.
[6:45] And I've been to a lot of places and
[6:49] I've seen a lot of faces.
[6:53] And there's been times where I felt so
[6:56] all alone. home.
[7:00] But in those lonely hours,
[7:04] yes, those precious lonely hours,
[7:09] and Jesus let me know I was his own.
[7:16] And through it all,
[7:20] and through it all,
[7:24] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[7:28] I've learned to trust in God.
[7:32] Through it all,
[7:36] through it all,
[7:40] I've learned to depend upon his word.
[7:47] So I thank God for the mountains and I
[7:52] thank him for the valleys and I thank
[7:56] him for the storms he's brought me
[7:59] through.
[8:03] For if I've never had a problem,
[8:07] I wouldn't know that he could solve
[8:09] them. And I never know what faith in God
[8:14] can do.
[8:19] Through it all,
[8:22] through it all,
[8:26] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[8:30] I've learned to trust in God.
[8:34] Through it all.
[8:38] Through it all,
[8:41] I've learned to depend upon his word.
[8:47] Amen. We can trust Jesus this morning.
[8:50] Amen. You may be seated.

[13:19] From brother Juan Oetta.
[13:23] He's asking for prayer for his mom.
[13:25] She's having surgery on her heart on
[13:29] Thursday sometime Thursday. Her name is
[13:31] Sarah Oetta. They would truly appreciate
[13:36] us keeping her in prayer.
[13:41] I don't know if anyone would have
[13:42] something that they'd like to make known
[13:44] to the Lord with an uplifted hand, but
[13:46] we serve a mighty God.
[13:49] Everything that we have need of has been
[13:52] paid for. All we have to do is can
[13:55] receive. So let's go before the Lord
[13:58] this morning.

[14:33] and just asking that you'd move upon the
[14:35] scene for each of these requests.

[29:10] Let's bow our heads.
[29:13] Our father,
[29:16] thank you Lord for your spirit this
[29:18] morning.
[29:20] Father, it's
[29:24] somber spirit,
[29:26] Lord, that you brought amongst us this
[29:28] morning. And Father, we we appreciate
[29:31] your kindness, your love to us.
[29:35] Lord, as I read these scriptures, I pray
[29:37] that they would resonate
[29:39] the congregation's lives, Father. That
[29:42] we would leave here better people than
[29:44] when we came. that we be closer
[29:49] to our Lord and our Savior, Father, that
[29:51] we would have a better understanding of
[29:53] this word that could help us so much.
[29:57] Help us, Father, I pray in Jesus name.
[30:01] Amen. Amen. Let's before we're seated,
[30:05] let's turn in our Bibles. If the
[30:06] musicians could stay for a moment, let's
[30:08] turn in our Bibles to Matthew chapter 5.
[30:12] We will continue on with this sermon on
[30:14] the mount.
[30:17] [Music]
[30:19] We'll start with verse 17.
[30:22] [Music]
[30:30] It reads like this.
[30:32] [Music]
[30:34] Think not that I am come to destroy the
[30:36] law or the prophets. I am not come to
[30:39] destroy but to fulfill.
[30:42] For verily I say unto you, till heaven
[30:44] and earth pass, not one jot or one tit
[30:49] shall in no wise pass from the law till
[30:54] all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore
[30:57] shall break one of these least
[30:58] commandments, and shall teach men so, he
[31:01] shall be called the least in the kingdom
[31:03] of heaven. But whosoever shall do and
[31:06] teach them the same shall be called
[31:09] great in the kingdom of heaven. Amen.
[31:13] Buddy, can you do one more um one more
[31:15] verse of that evidence? That was really
[31:18] good before we seated.
[31:20] &gt;&gt; I see the evidence of your goodness
[31:27] all over my life.
[31:29] [Music]
[31:31] All my life
[31:34] [Music]
[31:37] and I see your promises in fulfillment
[31:43] all over my life.
[31:48] All over my life.
[31:52] Amen. He's good. You can be seated.
[31:55] Amen.
[31:57] You know, it's
[32:00] it's amazing how different God is and
[32:04] how that I like a church
[32:10] that is sensitive to the Holy Spirit,
[32:13] the spirit of God.
[32:15] Many times I come out and everybody's
[32:17] shouting, everybody's clapping,
[32:18] everybody's happy and and I come out and
[32:21] and I u I feel confident and and I can I
[32:26] can laugh with the congregation and then
[32:28] other times like today I came out and
[32:30] it's like whoa Lord this is a heavy
[32:33] spirit. It's a good feeling. And he's
[32:37] different. He's a God of variety.
[32:39] Sometimes you come out and like today
[32:41] and boy, he just wants to be worshiped.
[32:44] He wants us quiet before him. And that's
[32:46] why you see that there wasn't a lot of
[32:48] clapping. There wasn't a lot of just
[32:51] loud loud voices. It was just a somber
[32:54] spirit. And I want to be when I come
[32:56] out, I want to be in that spirit. When I
[32:59] walk to the pulpit, I want to be in the
[33:02] spirit that the Lord has placed upon the
[33:04] congregation because I believe it's him.
[33:07] And I want I want to follow up with that
[33:09] as as we move forward.
[33:12] We've been in this for our visitors.
[33:15] We've been in this sermon on the mount
[33:17] and uh it's tremendous. I do like seeing
[33:21] our visitors. I didn't uh Who's this

[33:53] cousin here. Um, dear friends and

[34:08] missed. God bless you. Welcome. We've
[34:12] been going through the sermon on the
[34:13] mount.
[34:15] And it's been uh it's been really really
[34:17] good. I was talking with Daniel
[34:19] yesterday and I was telling him about
[34:21] what I'm going to minister on today and
[34:23] I was like, "Ah, buddy. It's it's really
[34:25] neat about how that Jesus goes to this
[34:30] about the the spirit really becoming
[34:32] alive in you." And Daniel's like, "Dad,
[34:35] h this has been really great." He says,
[34:37] "I love the way you've done this." He
[34:38] says, "It's been amazing." He says, "You
[34:40] went from the biatitudes and and how
[34:42] that the progression of becoming a
[34:45] Christian and then once you become a
[34:48] Christian, then you become the light of
[34:49] the world and you become the salt of the
[34:51] earth and you become a city on the
[34:53] hill." He's like, "Dad, I I just love
[34:55] the way that you've done it and and now
[34:57] how that you're going to the law and how
[34:59] this law becomes alive in you." I was
[35:01] like, "Buddy,
[35:03] um,
[35:05] God
[35:07] came down in flesh
[35:10] and preached this sermon." I'm just
[35:13] reading what he said. The greatness of
[35:16] this sermon,
[35:18] the masterpiece that this sermon is,
[35:22] Jesus preached this. This was his first
[35:25] public sermon. And we should be like
[35:28] that. We should be reading this word,
[35:31] this Matthew chapter 5 and 6 and 7 and
[35:34] be like, whoa, this is incredible.
[35:38] Who could say such words? Who could who
[35:42] could bring such wisdom? And that's what
[35:45] this Jesus did. He's up on this
[35:46] mountain, up on this hill,
[35:49] and all of these people are around them.
[35:54] And these are really this is his first
[35:57] recorded sermon that we have. He had a
[36:00] reputation. He already had a reputation.
[36:02] We know that his reputation was he the
[36:05] believe it's the book of Luke that says
[36:07] he grew in stature and he grew in in the
[36:12] confidence of God and in man. He he grew
[36:15] in that and and he he grew in favor and
[36:19] he had already healed the sick and he
[36:22] already preached repent for the kingdom
[36:24] of heaven is at hand. So this man had a
[36:27] reputation
[36:29] and he starts preaching this kingdom of
[36:31] heaven or kingdom of God. And when he's
[36:34] talking about this kingdom of heaven,
[36:36] this kingdom of heaven, it's a it's it's
[36:38] not like you think. It's not it's not
[36:40] off in heaven. This is a a a reality, a
[36:42] present reality that we are living in as
[36:45] Jesus is preaching this and it gives us
[36:47] a future hope of what God has in store
[36:49] for us. So when you when you hear you
[36:52] read and Jesus is saying that the the
[36:55] kingdom of heaven or the kingdom of God
[36:57] is at hand, he's talking about living on
[36:59] earth right now and what we are doing.
[37:03] And this
[37:05] this uh sermon on the mount, it is a
[37:08] pivotal time in history. This is when
[37:12] the Old Testament and all of the
[37:14] prophets come to the point that all of
[37:18] these prophecies are fulfilled
[37:21] in this man, Jesus Christ. And now he is
[37:26] bringing all of the Old Testament. He's
[37:28] bringing it to life. And he's saying,
[37:29] "Hey, this is all of it. This is what
[37:32] they were all asking for. This is this
[37:34] is the mystery of God revealed right
[37:36] here in this man, Jesus Christ. It's
[37:38] it's really the pivotal time in history
[37:43] that for 2,000 years they've been
[37:46] preaching the same thing. They've been
[37:47] preaching this law and now it is time.
[37:50] Imagine 2,000 years. It's time to make
[37:52] the next step. And Jesus here in this
[37:56] sermon on the mount, he's laying a
[37:58] foundation for us all to make this next
[38:00] step and it is amazing. His words are
[38:06] just incredible. So he started we've
[38:09] gone through the biatitudes and he says
[38:12] he says things like blessed are the poor
[38:13] in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of
[38:15] of heaven. You have to understand you
[38:18] have to be poor in spirit. You have to
[38:19] understand that you're a sinner. You can
[38:21] witness and you can teach and you can do
[38:24] everything that you know how to to
[38:25] someone, but until they realize that
[38:27] they're a sinner, until they realize
[38:30] that they're not all of that, until they
[38:32] realize that they need a savior,
[38:34] friends, there's nothing you can do.
[38:37] You have to someone has to realize I
[38:40] need help before you can give them help.
[38:43] They need they need to realize I am not
[38:46] a good person. And let me tell you,
[38:47] there has never except for Jesus, there
[38:50] has never been someone someone born that
[38:52] is a good person. All of us need saving.
[38:56] And then he says, "Blessed are they that
[38:57] mourn for they shall be comforted." You
[39:01] have to regret your sins. You have to
[39:04] regret your decisions. You have to say,
[39:07] "Oh, Lord, I wish I wouldn't have done
[39:09] that. I've done I've done this." You
[39:10] have to feel bad for your sins because
[39:13] that's the very start of repentance
[39:14] right there. Blessed are they that
[39:17] mourn, for they shall be comforted.
[39:20] Blessed are the meek, for they shall
[39:22] inherit the earth. You have to humble
[39:25] yourself and be able to take correction.
[39:28] Now, blessed are they which do hunger
[39:31] and thirst after righteousness, for they
[39:33] shall be f filled. Then, after you've
[39:37] gone through through this progression,
[39:39] now you need to hunger and thirst. Lord,
[39:41] I want to be better. I want to be a
[39:43] better person. I want to change my life.
[39:46] I want to do everything that I can to
[39:48] give my heart to the Lord. And then it
[39:51] just you the rest is just putting on a
[39:54] Christian life. Taking taking what Jesus
[39:57] said and then putting into a putting
[40:00] into action. Now you are once you've
[40:02] done this, once you've repented, once
[40:03] you've changed, now you are the salt of
[40:05] the earth. Now you are the light of the
[40:08] world. Now you are a city up on a hill.
[40:10] Now you represent the Lord. And Jesus is
[40:14] is go going through this beautiful
[40:17] progression. And then he gets the next
[40:19] thing he comes to is what I just read.
[40:22] And it's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[40:24] wait a minute. Now, people are generally
[40:29] afraid of something new. They're afraid
[40:32] of change. You know, they they're most
[40:35] people are resistant to ch to change.
[40:38] They're suspicious of change because it
[40:40] just doesn't feel right feel right. And
[40:43] they're usually they'll condemn change
[40:46] because it's just this isn't what I'm
[40:47] used to. I I don't like this. I I just
[40:49] it this doesn't feel right. Well, it
[40:51] doesn't feel right because that's what
[40:52] you're used to doing. I remember Luke's
[40:54] an athlete. Claire's an athlete, too.
[40:57] When like when I was playing baseball, I
[41:00] remember the coach changing my delivery
[41:03] when I was a pitcher. And it felt so
[41:06] awkward.
[41:07] It's like, man, I I just I don't like
[41:09] doing it this way. I like doing it my
[41:11] way, but I was able to he coached me
[41:14] through it and then I was able to make a
[41:16] change and become a better pitcher. I
[41:18] remember when I was learning to snow ski
[41:20] is when when we were going down the
[41:23] hill, I liked having my feet wide like
[41:25] this because I had my balance and I
[41:27] wouldn't fall over.
[41:29] But to do it right, your feet need to be
[41:32] together.
[41:34] But I liked going like this and and the
[41:36] my friends, they they had their feet
[41:37] apart, you know, and they could get down
[41:39] the the hill and I was trying to do it
[41:42] the way the coach said it. So I would
[41:44] put my feet together and I'd fall. And
[41:47] eventually I got to where I could go
[41:49] down the slopes faster and better. And I
[41:53] learned that putting my feet together is
[41:56] more efficient when you're going through
[41:58] the mogul and it's quicker. And if your
[42:00] feet are apart like this, you can't do
[42:02] what you can when you have the proper
[42:04] form. But it's awkward when you first do
[42:06] it. So after a while, after a year or
[42:09] so, I was cruising down the slopes like
[42:12] a pro, and my buddies were still
[42:14] snowplowing down. They didn't know what
[42:17] they were doing, but they weren't
[42:18] falling. I f I fell a lot more at the
[42:21] beginning, but I got better at it. And
[42:24] that's how that's how as a Christian
[42:26] sometimes it doesn't feel right when we
[42:29] make a change. It doesn't feel right
[42:31] when your coach is trying to get you to
[42:33] to swing a different way. But listen to
[42:37] him and it will make you a better
[42:39] person. And that's why this Jesus when
[42:41] he is coming, he knows what's going to
[42:44] happen when he's preaching. He knows
[42:47] he's going to bring some things that
[42:49] don't resonate with the crowd or that
[42:52] that they're going to be like, "Ah,
[42:53] that's not what I learned in school.
[42:55] That's not what I learned in the
[42:56] synagogue. That's not what my my um my
[42:58] priest used to tell me." And Jesus, he
[43:01] is preempting that. And he's saying,
[43:04] "Listen, I'm not coming here to try to
[43:06] change everything that you've heard."
[43:09] He's saying that just just hear me out
[43:12] and you'll be better for it if you just
[43:16] understand
[43:18] what these rules in the Old Testament
[43:21] are for. Just understand that. I'm sure
[43:24] that there was when on that sermon on
[43:26] the mount, I'm sure there were plenty of
[43:27] teenagers out there that were sitting on
[43:29] the hill and with their long curly locks
[43:32] hanging down and the boys are like,
[43:34] "Man, why do I have to have this hair
[43:36] like this? Why do I have to wear it like
[43:38] this? And and why why can't I just cut
[43:40] my beard? Why can't I look like the
[43:42] Romans? Why can't I look like them? You
[43:44] know, my my face is patchy and I look
[43:47] dumb and I have these weird real weird
[43:49] curls coming out. How come I have to
[43:51] look like this? And Jesus is up there
[43:53] and he's saying that he's going to tell
[43:56] us in the sermon on the mount that
[43:57] everything that you have learned is
[43:59] going to be for a reason.
[44:02] And Jesus is going to in this sermon on
[44:05] the mount, Jesus is going to take all of
[44:08] the Old Testament that they have been
[44:10] taught, all of their rules and
[44:11] regulations, how ridiculous they may
[44:13] seem, and he's going to say, "Hey, this
[44:16] is the purpose of all of them." And no,
[44:20] I am not here to tell you that
[44:23] everything that you've learned before is
[44:24] wrong. He's saying I am here to tell you
[44:28] that it is fulfilled in me
[44:32] and also it can be applied to this day.
[44:35] It needs to be alive in you. Jesus is
[44:39] talking about the inner man.
[44:43] While the law was talking about the
[44:45] outward appearance,
[44:47] but Jesus, he is taking it deeper and
[44:50] he's making it about the inside man. The
[44:54] heart of a person is what Jesus is
[44:56] after. And that's what his whole
[44:58] ministry is going to be. And you have to
[45:01] understand that before you can really
[45:04] understand Jesus's ministry or the
[45:06] apostles ministry after him. You have to
[45:08] understand that it is no longer about
[45:11] the outward appearance. That outward
[45:13] appearance was right. That outward that
[45:15] outward teaching was right. But you need
[45:18] to now apply it to the inside man. And
[45:22] then wow does it become powerful. You
[45:26] need to understand that these concepts
[45:29] that that we've learned in the Old
[45:31] Testament, Jesus speaking,
[45:34] that there is a difference now between
[45:38] the Old Testament
[45:41] and the New Testament. Remember, there
[45:42] was no New Testament when Jesus was
[45:44] there. This is just the start of the New
[45:46] Testament. That that Old Testament now
[45:48] needs to come to life. And Jesus is
[45:50] like, "No, you don't throw it out.
[45:53] It's just as true.
[45:55] So
[45:57] when when we're learning these things,
[46:00] one of the questions that comes up so
[46:01] much for Christians is, "Do I believe
[46:04] the Old Testament or not?"
[46:07] And a lot of times you'll hear, "Well,
[46:11] that's Old Testament."
[46:13] We don't believe that. But you, Jesus
[46:15] said that none of it will fail. All of
[46:17] it's true.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; So how can that be?
[46:22] and then you come out and then Paul's
[46:25] like, "Yeah, you don't have to do that
[46:26] anymore." So, how can that make sense?
[46:30] Best way really to understand these
[46:33] things is to just we dig into the
[46:37] scriptures and then we see how these
[46:39] scriptures apply to us.
[46:42] But one thing that I don't like and I've
[46:46] said this many times is if somebody
[46:49] tells you no don't ask why just believe
[46:51] it. You should ask why.
[46:55] Very important. If somebody says, "Oh,
[46:58] just just don't question it. Just
[46:59] believe it. Just have faith." Wait a
[47:01] minute. How can you have faith in
[47:03] something that doesn't make sense?
[47:06] You need to ask why. Why do we do
[47:08] things? Why do we Why did the boys have
[47:12] long hair, the the Orthodox Jews? Why do
[47:15] they not shave the sides of their head?
[47:17] Why do certain Why do we have certain
[47:20] dress codes? What are these things? Why
[47:22] do they matter?
[47:24] Heath um asked me after service, he said
[47:28] that he wants to be anointed with oil.
[47:30] He's struggling with some health
[47:31] problems.
[47:33] What does it mean? Why? Why do we anoint
[47:36] with oil? Well, the Bible says so. Why?
[47:40] There's certain things that are symbolic
[47:43] in the Bible. Being anointed with oil is
[47:46] symbolic. It represents things in the
[47:49] Bible. It represents the Holy Spirit
[47:52] when we anoint with oil. The ano oil
[47:55] also represents soothing properties.
[47:58] Makes you feel better if you have a burn
[48:00] or something like that. And to me, the
[48:02] anointing oil, when I anoint someone
[48:05] with oil, it supersedes my own faith
[48:09] because I'm reading out of the Bible to
[48:11] do this. And it's like, it doesn't
[48:14] matter my faith or not. It doesn't
[48:16] matter. I have faith in God's word, what
[48:18] it says. I am just doing what the word
[48:20] says. And then when I anoint you with
[48:22] oil, then I just put it in the Lord's
[48:24] hands. And now it's his job. It's not my
[48:26] job.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; I have done what God told me to do.
[48:30] James chapter 5, I believe it's James
[48:33] chapter 5, it says, "Is there any sick
[48:35] among you? Let him call for the elders
[48:37] of the church and let them pray over
[48:39] him, anointing him with oil in the name
[48:42] of the Lord. I take the no the oil and I
[48:44] do that and anoint you in the name of
[48:46] the Lord Jesus.
[48:48] And the prayer of faith shall save the
[48:49] sick and the Lord shall raise him up and
[48:51] if he have committed sins, it shall be
[48:54] forgiven him."
[48:55] So when I anoint with oil, just the very
[48:57] act is really all the faith that I
[49:00] needed to do. I have faith that God's
[49:03] word is true. I take the oil. I anoint
[49:06] you. I showed my faith. Now Lord, it's
[49:09] in your hands. I've seen so many people
[49:11] healed just from the very anointing oil.
[49:15] It's not the literal thing, but that oil
[49:17] represents something else. It's like
[49:20] baptism. Baptism is symbolic. It's not
[49:22] baptiz baptism that saves you. saves
[49:24] you. It represents taking the same path
[49:27] as Jesus,
[49:29] dying to yourself and going down into
[49:31] the water and the water washing away
[49:34] your sins and then coming up a clean
[49:36] vessel set aside for service of the
[49:39] Lord. That's what baptism represents.
[49:41] It's symbolic of something else and
[49:43] that's why we do it. This is symbolic.
[49:45] Lord, I'm doing this to symbolize what
[49:47] you've done in my life. But then there
[49:49] are other things that are literal in the
[49:53] Bible. Now, I'm getting to the Old
[49:55] Testament here. I'm trying to lay a
[49:56] foundation for some of the things in the
[49:58] Old Testament I want to talk about.
[50:00] There are also literal things.
[50:03] Believe it's the uh fourth I think it's
[50:06] the fourth commandment to remember the
[50:08] Sabbath day to keep it holy. That's a
[50:11] literal thing. This isn't symbolic
[50:14] that we prepare we we that God has told
[50:19] us to set one day aside in our week.
[50:22] Don't work on that day. Don't do don't
[50:24] do any type of manual labor on that day.
[50:26] Set that day aside from the Lord be for
[50:29] the Lord because if you don't, you're
[50:31] going to continue on every day and
[50:33] you're not going to give the Lord at
[50:35] least one day because you're humans and
[50:38] it's human nature. That's why we come to
[50:41] church. That's why we get up in the
[50:43] morning. That's why we argue with our
[50:46] spouse as we're trying to get the kids
[50:48] ready. We're making an effort. You
[50:50] shouldn't do that. But that's what
[50:52] that's what we do. That's why sometimes
[50:55] it's the hardest thing to drive to
[50:57] church. That's when the enemy gets in
[50:59] there and you feel the fighting and you
[51:01] feel the arguing because that pressure
[51:03] because you're doing something right.
[51:04] You're doing an ordinance of God in
[51:06] coming to church. It's important. You
[51:09] are making that effort. And if you
[51:11] don't, you might you might listen to a
[51:13] sermon on Sunday morning while you're
[51:17] washing your car or do some doing
[51:19] something else.
[51:21] That's not the same as giving it to God.
[51:24] You're not going through everything
[51:26] associated with worshiping. You're not
[51:29] getting your best clothes on. You're not
[51:33] waking up early. You're not giving the
[51:36] Lord that. And that's why he says this
[51:38] commandment, honor the Sabbath day to
[51:41] keep it holy. And we continue on with
[51:43] that today and taking one day the Lord's
[51:46] day on Sunday and setting it aside for
[51:50] God because
[51:53] the Bible says Jesus said that he says
[51:56] man wasn't created for the Sabbath.
[52:00] It was the Sabbath was created for man.
[52:02] The Sabbath is there to help us to make
[52:05] us better people. Because if we don't if
[52:07] we don't have that dedication in our
[52:09] life, we won't be as good of a person.
[52:12] You cannot be as good of a person
[52:15] outside not going to church as you can
[52:18] in church. Why?
[52:21] Doesn't mean you won't learn more of the
[52:23] word. You can dedicate every day and in
[52:26] studying the word, but you need to come
[52:28] in.
[52:29] You need to bring your gift into the
[52:31] church. You need to help. You need to
[52:34] serve others. And then you come in and
[52:37] then you're around others and it's it's
[52:40] I mean it's very seldom that you ever
[52:42] said, "I wish I wouldn't have gone to
[52:43] church today."
[52:45] But there's many times you say, "Man, I
[52:47] wish I I would have gone, but now I'm
[52:48] just into this rut and I'm not going
[52:51] in."
[52:52] So there are literal things in the Old
[52:54] Testament.
[52:56] And then there are symbolic things. And
[53:00] when Jesus is talking about this, I'm
[53:02] looking forward to getting into this.
[53:03] He's he's He knows that he's going to be
[53:07] preaching things on this day and in the
[53:10] next three years that are going to be
[53:13] new and going to be difficult for the
[53:15] people to understand. And he's saying
[53:17] that listen, I'm still for the prophets.
[53:20] I'm still for the law. Just listen to
[53:24] me. Just let it become real in your
[53:27] life.
[53:29] So in Matthew chapter 5, he says this.
[53:32] Let's get into it. Verse number 17,
[53:36] he says this, "Think not that I am come
[53:38] to destroy the law or the prophets. I am
[53:41] not come to destroy it, but to fulfill."
[53:45] So some people, as I said, some people
[53:47] pose the argument, what good is the Old
[53:49] Testament to us? Anyways,
[53:52] and then they'll quote strange
[53:54] commandments in the Old Testament that I
[53:57] mentioned one of them like a man
[53:58] shouldn't cut the hair next to his
[54:00] temple or that talks about slavery or
[54:04] talks about other things like that. Um
[54:06] or that the person maybe that commits
[54:08] adultery should be stoned or that um
[54:11] that you shouldn't cut your beard or
[54:13] many of those other things. So, are we
[54:15] under the new covenant
[54:18] or are we under the old covenant? And
[54:20] and everybody will say that we're under
[54:22] the new covenant. And that's true. But
[54:24] we don't. Jesus is saying, "Don't throw
[54:26] away the old."
[54:28] Remember Jesus's audience. He's not
[54:30] preaching to Gentiles. He's preaching to
[54:32] Jews. He's preaching to the ones who
[54:34] came up under the law. They went to the
[54:36] synagogue. They honor the Sabbath. They
[54:37] do the they they follow all the laws.
[54:39] And there's like over 600 laws that they
[54:43] try to follow, every one of them. and
[54:46] they live in a legalistic way of life,
[54:48] but the spirit is not there with them.
[54:50] And now with this sermon on the mount,
[54:53] he's laying the foundation for the
[54:55] spirit to come down. And Jesus is now
[54:59] not talking about the outward person.
[55:01] He's talking about the inward person.
[55:05] For verily I say to you, till heaven and
[55:08] earth pass, one jot or one tit shall in
[55:12] no wise pass from the law till all be
[55:15] fulfilled. The word jot or tit, it's
[55:18] just the smallest marks in the Hebrew
[55:20] alphabet, but they have meaning.
[55:23] Each one, even though it may be very
[55:25] small, each one has a meaning. So Jesus
[55:29] is saying right here that it is all
[55:31] important.
[55:33] All of it. You can't just throw it out.
[55:36] And whosoever therefore shall break one
[55:37] of the least of these commandments and
[55:39] teach and teach men so, he shall be
[55:42] called the least in the kingdom of
[55:43] heaven. But whosoever shall do and teach
[55:45] them, the same shall be called great in
[55:48] the kingdom of heaven. This has troubled
[55:51] me. I got to admit really for the past
[55:53] week. I've been praying about this and
[55:56] meditating on it. Lord, I don't want to
[56:01] say that we don't have to worry about
[56:04] certain things that Moses commanded,
[56:07] even though they don't they don't make
[56:08] sense at all. I don't want to ever say
[56:10] something like that. And I don't want to
[56:13] be guilty of teaching that. You notice
[56:17] again in verse 17, it says, he says,
[56:20] "Think not that I am come to destroy the
[56:22] law of the prophets. I came not to d I
[56:25] came not I I am not come to destroy but
[56:29] fulfill. So the law we know we got to
[56:33] know the difference with the law and the
[56:35] prophets. The law is the Torah, Genesis
[56:40] through Deuteronomy, the Moses's
[56:42] writings, first five books of the Bible,
[56:44] and then the prophets is everything else
[56:46] in this case. That's Jonah and and
[56:50] Samuel and and all of and Isaiah and
[56:52] Jeremiah. All of those. So Jesus is
[56:55] saying he's lumping them all together
[56:56] and he's saying that all of the Bible is
[56:59] true. The Bible to that day was day was
[57:01] the Old Testament. All of it is true.
[57:05] Now if you look at the laws, let's go to
[57:07] Moses's laws. Most commentaries on this,
[57:11] you'll see really there's three
[57:13] different laws that we have. There are
[57:16] the moral laws which are the ten
[57:18] commandments. Don't lie, don't cheat,
[57:20] don't steal, don't kill, and be honest.
[57:23] The Christians believe those are still
[57:25] in effect. All right.
[57:28] Then there's the ceremonial laws.
[57:30] There's the feast days, the sacrifices,
[57:33] sacrificing an animal for your sins,
[57:36] special diets, uh special dietary laws.
[57:39] Really, the Christians believe that
[57:42] those were fulfilled in Jesus Christ. So
[57:45] when you sin, you don't take an animal
[57:48] and you and kill it for your sins. No,
[57:50] that's already be done. That's already
[57:52] been fulfilled.
[57:54] All right? Those are the ceremonial
[57:56] laws. And then
[57:59] there's these so society laws.
[58:03] That's the outward appearance.
[58:06] And many of those
[58:09] were written for the time that Moses
[58:13] wrote them. It doesn't mean that they've
[58:15] passed away or they've expired
[58:18] and but it means that they are not
[58:20] necessarily applicable in today's
[58:22] society like slavery.
[58:25] When Moses wrote these things, there was
[58:27] slavery. So, he wrote certain things
[58:31] about slavery like you're only allowed
[58:33] to have a Hebrew slave for six years
[58:36] in Exodus chapter 21. That doesn't apply
[58:38] to us today. If you strike your slave in
[58:42] the eye and he loses the eye, then you
[58:43] are to let him go go free. That doesn't
[58:47] apply to us today. Anyone who beats
[58:49] their male or female slave with a rod
[58:51] must be punished if the slave dies as a
[58:54] direct result.
[58:56] That's not doesn't apply to our society
[59:00] today. All right? And and we can't try
[59:03] to make it. And then there's other
[59:05] places that like I mentioned the Hebrews
[59:09] in Leviticus shaving they they weren't
[59:12] allowed to shave the temple of of their
[59:14] head. They weren't allowed to cut their
[59:15] hair. And you see in the Orthodox Jews
[59:18] today, they still live by that. You see
[59:21] they have the long curls coming down.
[59:23] They are not to cut that part of their
[59:25] hair because it says this in the
[59:27] Levitical laws. Well, why does it say
[59:29] that?
[59:30] It says it because they were about to go
[59:33] over the Jordan River. They were about
[59:35] to go over with Moses over into the
[59:37] promised land. They came out of Egypt
[59:39] with with great power of God. They went
[59:42] through the desert and now they were
[59:44] going over into this place called
[59:45] Canaan's land that was filled with
[59:48] idolattors and filled with witchcraft
[59:50] and filled with all of these things. And
[59:52] some of the things that were part of
[59:54] that society
[59:57] were associated with idolatry, were
[1:00:00] associated with witchcraft. And Moses is
[1:00:03] saying, don't do what they do. And part
[1:00:07] of it was they would shave their parts
[1:00:10] of their their head or they would trim
[1:00:13] their beard in a certain way and it was
[1:00:16] for idolatry. It was for a heathen
[1:00:19] practice. And Moses is like, "Don't do
[1:00:22] that." And God was like, "When you go
[1:00:25] over there, don't act like them. Don't
[1:00:28] mimic them today." Now, many of these
[1:00:31] things we can apply today. Now,
[1:00:35] obviously, the shaving of the head is is
[1:00:37] different, but I hope it's different,
[1:00:42] but
[1:00:43] it's still the the foundation is right.
[1:00:47] is that the influencers we see out in
[1:00:51] out on uh
[1:00:54] the uh social media and that they are
[1:00:56] influencing people to live in a certain
[1:00:59] way that is not godly
[1:01:04] and then they are
[1:01:06] people mimic what they do.
[1:01:11] And you can take these scriptures and
[1:01:13] they may not mean anything to us, but
[1:01:15] you can take these scriptures and you
[1:01:16] can say, "Wait a minute, that it may
[1:01:19] have been cutting of hair over here or
[1:01:21] wearing a certain garment over over
[1:01:22] there, but I can see now today that
[1:01:26] these people that are are that we are
[1:01:29] mimicking that we are acting like they
[1:01:32] are not good examples. They are not
[1:01:34] Christians. They are not godly. and to
[1:01:37] ma to for us to want to look like them
[1:01:40] or act like them or do the same thing
[1:01:42] that they do. Now we are crossing the
[1:01:44] the barrier line where God doesn't want
[1:01:47] us to cross. But this spirit that was in
[1:01:50] Moses when he was writing that is the
[1:01:53] same spirit now that Jesus is going to
[1:01:55] tell us that it needs to be inside of
[1:01:57] you to where now you're not following a
[1:02:00] set of rules. And if we follow a set of
[1:02:02] rules, you know what it always bring? It
[1:02:04] always brings sin.
[1:02:06] It brings immoral living.
[1:02:09] Even though we may wear the costume,
[1:02:13] sin comes in
[1:02:17] and it's because it's an outward show.
[1:02:21] And Jesus is getting at the heart and
[1:02:24] he's going to talk about adultery and
[1:02:26] he's going to talk about many things in
[1:02:28] coming up in this sermon on the mount
[1:02:30] that he's like, "Oh yeah, you said
[1:02:33] that." Really? Moses said, "Oh, yeah.
[1:02:35] It's okay to divorce your wife
[1:02:39] as long as you agree and you write her
[1:02:41] this this note. Give it to her and then
[1:02:43] she can go marry somebody else." And
[1:02:46] Jesus is like, "Wait a minute." No. He
[1:02:49] wants this word now to live within us so
[1:02:54] we understand why these things were
[1:02:56] commanded.
[1:02:58] So, we don't go to the there's no law
[1:03:01] maybe against going to the clubs.
[1:03:05] There's no law against wearing
[1:03:07] provocative clothes maybe that the
[1:03:08] influencers wear. But we want to we
[1:03:11] don't want to act like them. We don't
[1:03:13] want to look like them. We want to act
[1:03:14] like a Christian. We want to talk like a
[1:03:16] Christian. We don't want to cuss
[1:03:20] because that's what the unbelievers do.
[1:03:22] That's what the when Moses when they
[1:03:25] were going over, he's like, "Don't act
[1:03:26] like them. Don't be like them because it
[1:03:29] brings in sin into your life. I want to
[1:03:32] read from Deuteronomy
[1:03:36] just to show you what I'm talking about
[1:03:39] here. Deuteronomy chapter 22. These
[1:03:42] things sound strange, but they're
[1:03:44] societal laws and we can apply them to
[1:03:47] our lives. So when we're at home, when
[1:03:49] we're talking with our wives or husbands
[1:03:51] or or children, we can read the Old
[1:03:54] Testament and be like, well, you know,
[1:03:56] how does this apply to my life? And it
[1:03:59] may seem like the strangest scripture,
[1:04:00] but we can take that scripture and say,
[1:04:03] okay, here's the meaning behind it.
[1:04:05] Here's what God is trying to protect us
[1:04:08] from. Now, how can we apply it?
[1:04:11] You shall not Deuteronomy chapter 22
[1:04:14] verse one says this. You shall not see
[1:04:19] your brother's ox or his sheep going
[1:04:21] astray and hide yourself from them. You
[1:04:24] shall certainly bring them back to your
[1:04:26] brother. How many people in this room
[1:04:28] own an ox?
[1:04:32] Brother David from Kenya. You really
[1:04:35] praise God. Brother David has an ox. So
[1:04:38] you can read this literally.
[1:04:43] It doesn't apply to me. All right? But
[1:04:46] it does apply to us. Not one jot or one
[1:04:50] tit shall pass away. Listen to this. And
[1:04:52] if your brother is not near you or if
[1:04:55] you do not know him, then you shall
[1:04:58] bring it to your own house and it shall
[1:05:00] remain with you until your brother seeks
[1:05:02] it and then you shall restore him. So if
[1:05:04] this ox gets lost, then you go get this
[1:05:08] ox, you shall do the same with his
[1:05:11] donkey, and so shall you do with his
[1:05:14] garment. With anything lost of your
[1:05:15] brothers, which he has lost, you have
[1:05:17] found, so you shall do likewise.
[1:05:20] You must not hide yourself.
[1:05:23] So
[1:05:25] do we have a donkey? How many How many
[1:05:27] have a donkey? We have one person with
[1:05:28] an ax. How many have a donkey? Salazars
[1:05:31] aren't here.
[1:05:34] How many have a donkey? But how many
[1:05:36] have a purse?
[1:05:38] How many have a wallet?
[1:05:41] How many have a phone?
[1:05:43] So if you find your brother's wallet or
[1:05:46] his phone, tell him you have it. If you
[1:05:49] find your brother's iPad, tell him that
[1:05:51] you have it so he can come pick it up.
[1:05:54] The law didn't just pass away because we
[1:05:56] don't own own donkeys and oxes.
[1:05:58] It's a it's a way of thinking. It's a
[1:06:01] way of doing things. this law. Now,
[1:06:03] before they were like, well, that's not
[1:06:05] that's technically not an ox. That's a
[1:06:07] cow, so it doesn't count. But no, now
[1:06:11] Jesus is is going to be telling us, make
[1:06:13] these things real. You shall not you
[1:06:17] shall not see your brother's donkey or
[1:06:18] his ox fall down along the road and hide
[1:06:21] yourself from them. You shall surely
[1:06:23] help him lift them up again. This
[1:06:26] doesn't necessarily apply to today's
[1:06:28] society, but if you see somebody's dog
[1:06:30] loose on the streets
[1:06:33] and you just drive by, no. Now, you're
[1:06:36] breaking this commandment.
[1:06:38] Go get the dog. Go get it and bring it
[1:06:42] home. Don't just say, "Hey, I saw your
[1:06:44] dog out there running." You have to take
[1:06:46] You have to make an effort. You have to
[1:06:48] go get the dog. You have to help your
[1:06:49] brother. Verse number five, a woman
[1:06:52] shall not wear anything that pertains to
[1:06:54] a man, nor shall a man put on a woman's
[1:06:56] garment, for all who do so are an
[1:06:59] abomination to the Lord your God.
[1:07:02] When this was written, men and women
[1:07:04] women wore robes.
[1:07:06] Society is different, but the concept is
[1:07:09] the same. A man should not wear feminine
[1:07:12] clothes that makes him look like a
[1:07:15] woman.
[1:07:16] And a woman shouldn't wear masculine
[1:07:19] clothes that makes her look like a man.
[1:07:23] The society, societal issues, they were
[1:07:26] different back then. They were different
[1:07:28] clothing back then, but the concept was
[1:07:31] the same. And a man really, it's saying
[1:07:33] a man should not be feminine and a woman
[1:07:36] should not be masculine. I know that's
[1:07:39] not really what the influencers teach
[1:07:40] you on the on the on the social media,
[1:07:43] but you shouldn't. A a girl should be
[1:07:46] feminine. She should be a lady. And a
[1:07:50] man shouldn't be a
[1:07:53] He should be a man.
[1:07:56] And today's society is maybe different
[1:07:58] than it was 4,000 years ago, 3,000 years
[1:08:02] ago, 70 years ago, but the concept is
[1:08:06] the same.
[1:08:08] A man should not dress like a woman. I
[1:08:12] was in Home Depot the other day.
[1:08:15] Strangest thing.
[1:08:18] It was weirder than Walmart on this day.
[1:08:22] I'm in Home Depot and I'm going along
[1:08:26] and there's this like 63
[1:08:30] 60some year old man wrinkled big old
[1:08:34] giant hands with wrinkled hands like
[1:08:36] he's been working his whole life wearing
[1:08:39] a dress.
[1:08:41] I mean a real dress, not like a kilt. He
[1:08:45] was wearing a dress and he's walking
[1:08:48] through the store and even people are
[1:08:50] like, "Whoa,
[1:08:52] this is weird.
[1:08:54] This is what he's talking about.
[1:08:58] A man should not wear that which
[1:08:59] pertains to a woman." And how much are
[1:09:02] we seeing it now in our day? And how
[1:09:05] much are we seeing the other way around
[1:09:07] where women are dressing and acting like
[1:09:11] something that they weren't born to act
[1:09:13] and to the all the way to science has
[1:09:15] made it to where they can just change
[1:09:16] genders. But look at how God saw this
[1:09:19] thousands of years ago and he said don't
[1:09:22] do it and this we don't just leave that
[1:09:24] in the Old Testament. We can bring that
[1:09:26] out to today that no we don't do that.
[1:09:30] As I said a girl should be a girl. She
[1:09:34] should be feminine and a man should be
[1:09:36] masculine. Verse number six.
[1:09:40] And you think when you're reading this
[1:09:42] Old Testament, as I said, apply it to
[1:09:44] your life.
[1:09:46] How would you apply this one? Verse
[1:09:48] number six. If a bird's nest happened to
[1:09:50] be before you along the w along the way
[1:09:53] in any tree or on the ground with young
[1:09:56] ones or eggs with the mother sitting on
[1:09:58] on the young or on the eggs, you shall
[1:10:01] not take the mother with the young. You
[1:10:03] shall surely let the mother go and take
[1:10:06] the young for yourself that it may be
[1:10:08] well with you and that you may prolong
[1:10:10] your days. How would that affect us?
[1:10:14] This is a society thing. It was
[1:10:16] happening in that society. But when we
[1:10:18] read the Bible, don't forget Jesus said,
[1:10:20] "Not one jot, not one tit." It's all
[1:10:22] true. So if you found a bird, bird nest,
[1:10:27] and here this bird is sitting on the
[1:10:28] babies. Um, before I guess they were
[1:10:32] eating them, it's gross, you know? I
[1:10:35] mean today in today's society or maybe
[1:10:37] they were taking them and maybe starting
[1:10:39] their own collection of birds but the
[1:10:43] Bible says that you don't
[1:10:46] take the whole family. You just you
[1:10:49] leave the mother and you can take the
[1:10:51] babies. Why? It had a very specific
[1:10:55] purpose. And that's what you have to
[1:10:56] say. You have to say why why why does
[1:11:00] the Bible say this? It has. It's not any
[1:11:03] of it's not going to pass away.
[1:11:05] Why does it say that? How many hunters
[1:11:10] are here? There's quite a few. You go
[1:11:13] out, if you're hunting bears
[1:11:16] in Arizona, in each unit, there's a
[1:11:19] quota for s for females. And once that
[1:11:22] quota is hit, whether it's two or three
[1:11:24] or whatever it is, then they shut down
[1:11:26] the hunt. It's to prolong the species to
[1:11:30] to make sure we have that renewable
[1:11:32] resource. And here this is very plain.
[1:11:37] God's telling them he's like, "Listen,
[1:11:38] if you just take everything right now,
[1:11:40] you're not going to have anything for
[1:11:42] the future.
[1:11:43] It's very it's it makes a lot of sense
[1:11:46] and it's it's the word of God. And if
[1:11:49] you you can even apply it to your lives.
[1:11:51] I remember we we had did a project in
[1:11:54] East Africa and they had a a big
[1:11:56] hurricane that came through and wiped
[1:11:57] out all their crops and there was still
[1:11:59] time to get the corn in the ground. So
[1:12:02] we sent these we sent this seed corn
[1:12:05] there and they took the corn and instead
[1:12:10] of planting it, they ate it.
[1:12:13] They cooked it up and ate it. They
[1:12:15] wanted that meal right now. But it's
[1:12:17] like, no,
[1:12:19] you should have put it in the ground and
[1:12:21] then you would have had crops later on,
[1:12:23] but instead you wiped it all out and now
[1:12:26] you're going to suffer down the road.
[1:12:28] And here's this is what the word is
[1:12:29] saying that don't take all of your
[1:12:31] resources now, put some back for later
[1:12:34] and have that sustainable, that
[1:12:35] renewable resource. And that's what
[1:12:37] these laws are. These these laws, they
[1:12:40] may not you may not think that they
[1:12:41] apply in our society, but it doesn't
[1:12:44] mean that the word wasn't perfect when
[1:12:45] it was spoken. Times change, our
[1:12:48] surroundings change, our cultures
[1:12:50] change, but the law is still right as we
[1:12:54] apply it to our own lives. And by the
[1:12:57] blood of Jesus Christ, we are not under
[1:13:00] that law. We don't sacrifice certain
[1:13:03] animals when we sin. All right? because
[1:13:07] that was fulfilled in Jesus Christ. We
[1:13:09] see, okay, we don't do this anymore. And
[1:13:11] but we do ask why. Why did I have to why
[1:13:13] do we have to sacrifice a lamb? Why was
[1:13:15] it a a bull over here or an a uh why was
[1:13:18] it a turtle dove over here? All of those
[1:13:21] represent what Jesus Christ did on the
[1:13:23] cross. And we should ask why so that we
[1:13:26] will understand the purpose that Jesus
[1:13:28] came. So, back to the the cutting of of
[1:13:31] your hair in a certain way or wearing
[1:13:33] certain clothes, we understand that
[1:13:36] there needs to be a purpose behind that.
[1:13:41] And we need to understand those things.
[1:13:44] We don't want to present ourselves that
[1:13:46] makes us look like a homosexual or a
[1:13:49] man's not supposed to look feminine, a
[1:13:51] woman's not supposed to look masculine.
[1:13:53] We don't talk in the way that the world
[1:13:55] talks. We don't cuss. We're honest. When
[1:13:58] someone loses something, we help them
[1:14:00] find it. These are basic things that are
[1:14:02] in the Bible and that we can we can
[1:14:04] apply them to our own lives. In the Old
[1:14:06] Testament, it was about the outward man.
[1:14:10] And now Jesus, as he is going through
[1:14:13] this sermon on the mount, he is talking
[1:14:15] about the inward man, which is far more
[1:14:19] important, friends. And that's what this
[1:14:22] sermon on the mount
[1:14:24] is moving towards. Jesus is going to
[1:14:27] start going through these Old Testament
[1:14:29] things and he's gonna say they're right.
[1:14:31] You have heard this, but let me tell
[1:14:34] you, here's how it applies to your life.
[1:14:37] And it is powerful.
[1:14:40] Matthew chapter 5
[1:14:42] and uh boy, I didn't get very far. Uh
[1:14:45] verse number 20. Listen to this. Matthew
[1:14:48] 5:20. We'll continue on with sermon on
[1:14:51] the mount. For I say unto you, Jesus
[1:14:53] speaking, that except your righteousness
[1:14:57] shall shall exceed the righteousness of
[1:15:01] the scribes and Pharisees, you shall in
[1:15:04] no case enter the kingdom of heaven.
[1:15:07] Wow. Except your righteousness
[1:15:12] exceeds all of these people that are
[1:15:15] living these so-called perfect lives,
[1:15:18] then you'll in no wise enter the
[1:15:20] kingdom.
[1:15:23] He's like, "Dude, I'm not going to make
[1:15:26] it."
[1:15:30] But Jesus, there is something
[1:15:34] when we talk about this righteousness
[1:15:37] that if we truly accept Christ, if we
[1:15:41] truly accept him into our hearts, then
[1:15:46] there is a righteousness that comes in
[1:15:48] us. For I say unto you that except your
[1:15:51] righteousness shall exceed the
[1:15:52] righteousness of the scribes and
[1:15:54] Pharisees, you shall in no case enter
[1:15:57] into the kingdom of heaven.
[1:16:00] Let that one cook for a week. All right?
[1:16:04] Let that cook for this week. Think about
[1:16:06] that. Ponder on those things. Study on
[1:16:09] those things. And we'll close and the um
[1:16:12] musicians can come. I I got about a
[1:16:15] third of the way through, but it's good
[1:16:17] because we got next Sunday. And if the
[1:16:20] Lord comes between now and next Sunday,
[1:16:22] then we'll just pick this up on the
[1:16:23] other side, right? Maybe Jesus himself
[1:16:26] will tell us.
[1:16:28] Let's go to Galatians chapter 3. And
[1:16:30] I'll close with this.
[1:16:32] Galatians chapter 3 21 says this.
[1:16:38] Is the law then against the promises of
[1:16:42] God?
[1:16:44] God forbid.
[1:16:45] For if there had been a law given which
[1:16:49] could have given life, verily
[1:16:50] righteousness should have been by the
[1:16:53] law. The English Standard version of
[1:16:54] that says, "Is the law then contrary to
[1:16:57] the promises of God?" Certainly not. For
[1:17:00] if a law had been given that could give
[1:17:03] life, then righteousness would indeed be
[1:17:07] by the law.
[1:17:11] But the scripture hath concluded all
[1:17:14] under sin
[1:17:16] that the promise by faith of Jesus
[1:17:18] Christ might be given to them that
[1:17:21] believe.
[1:17:23] So he's saying, but the scriptures
[1:17:24] declare that we are all prisoners of
[1:17:27] sin.
[1:17:28] So we all receive God's promise of
[1:17:31] freedom by only believing in Jesus
[1:17:35] Christ is what the English the um New
[1:17:37] Living Translation. I'll say that again.
[1:17:38] But the scriptures declare that we are
[1:17:40] all prisoners of sin. So we receive
[1:17:43] God's promise of freedom only by
[1:17:45] believing in Jesus Christ. So now we're
[1:17:49] talking about how the righteousness can
[1:17:51] can be greater than the righteousness of
[1:17:53] those Pharisees and Sadducees.
[1:17:56] But before faith came,
[1:17:59] we were kept under the law, shut up
[1:18:02] under the faith which should afterwards
[1:18:04] be revealed. Wherefore the law was our
[1:18:07] school master to bring us unto Christ
[1:18:10] that we might be justified by faith.
[1:18:15] So the law is not done away with. It
[1:18:17] brings us to Jesus. So we can be
[1:18:21] justified by faith in him. Are you
[1:18:24] tracking? Now this is where Jesus is
[1:18:27] going with the sermon on the mount. But
[1:18:31] after that faith is come,
[1:18:34] we are no longer under a school master.
[1:18:38] So it doesn't mean that the law is done
[1:18:40] away with. It means that the law is a
[1:18:43] success in our lives because now we know
[1:18:45] Christ.
[1:18:48] For ye are all the children of God by
[1:18:51] faith in Christ Jesus.
[1:18:53] [Music]
[1:18:55] For as many of you as have been baptized
[1:18:57] into Christ have put on Christ. Now
[1:19:02] we're back into the symbolism. For as
[1:19:05] many of you have that have been baptized
[1:19:07] into Christ have put on Christ. You have
[1:19:10] taken on this Jesus Christ. When you are
[1:19:13] baptized, you say, "I now am a
[1:19:16] Christian. I am taking on this name of
[1:19:19] Jesus Christ and I am going to be a
[1:19:22] different person."
[1:19:24] You have put on Christ.
[1:19:27] Now you are not under that school
[1:19:29] master. You are not under that law. Now
[1:19:32] you know what the law means.
[1:19:35] Now it's become real to you.
[1:19:38] There is neither Jew nor Greek. There is
[1:19:40] neither bond nor free. There is neither
[1:19:42] male nor female. For you are all one in
[1:19:46] Christ.
[1:19:48] And if you be Christs,
[1:19:50] then you are Abraham's seed
[1:19:54] and hes according to the promise.
[1:19:58] So he's saying here, you can be born a
[1:20:00] gentile and have nothing to do with this
[1:20:04] lineage that the bi the Old Testament is
[1:20:06] all about from from Abraham all the way
[1:20:10] through Malachi. It's all about this one
[1:20:14] lineage, this these Jewish people. And
[1:20:17] now he's saying that now listen, if you
[1:20:20] have been baptized into Christ, if you
[1:20:22] have taken on that name of baptism, now
[1:20:25] you are an heir according to the
[1:20:28] promise. Now you are one of God's. Now
[1:20:31] you are are one of Jesus Christ's
[1:20:35] children. We talked a couple weeks ago
[1:20:38] about brother Jeremy, Sister Angela
[1:20:40] adopting these kids. They are now heirs
[1:20:45] to this family. They It's the same as if
[1:20:48] they were born into the family. And that
[1:20:50] is us. We may have lived this this
[1:20:52] terrible life. We have been may have
[1:20:54] done whatever it might be, but now we
[1:20:57] can take on this name of Jesus. And it's
[1:21:00] like, you know what? Now I'm a son of
[1:21:02] God. I am a daughter of God. Everything
[1:21:06] that Jesus promised to, I am heir to. If
[1:21:10] he promised my healing, I am heir to
[1:21:12] that. If he promised my salvation, I
[1:21:15] have a right to that. I have a right to
[1:21:17] everything that he is because I have
[1:21:20] given my life over to him. And the
[1:21:23] Apostle Paul says here, he says, "For as
[1:21:26] many of you as have been baptized into
[1:21:29] Christ have put on Christ." You have
[1:21:32] taken on that, you have taken on that
[1:21:34] name of Jesus.
[1:21:36] Amen.
[1:21:37] Do you see how the Old Testament when
[1:21:40] Jesus is say he's saying here is I
[1:21:42] didn't come to do away with it. I came
[1:21:45] to fulfill it. I came to make it real. I
[1:21:48] came to fulfill all of that sacrifice. I
[1:21:51] came to do that. I am that sacrifice.
[1:21:53] And all of the the things that Moses
[1:21:55] wrote and all and all of the laws that
[1:21:57] may not seem like like it means
[1:21:59] anything, but it does mean something.
[1:22:01] It's all correct. Don't just throw it
[1:22:04] out.
[1:22:06] Don't throw out that Old Testament. When
[1:22:08] you sit down with your families and you
[1:22:11] study the Bible, feel free to open up
[1:22:13] the Old Testament and then talk about
[1:22:16] it. How does this affect my life? Where
[1:22:19] is this in my life? And you can see you
[1:22:22] can apply all of it to our lives.
[1:22:25] For as many of you has been baptized
[1:22:27] into Christ, you have put on Christ.
[1:22:31] I know that we have one baptism. Do we
[1:22:33] have any more?
[1:22:35] We still have one. Yes. All right.
[1:22:38] Anybody else? To take on that name that
[1:22:42] you're no longer under that school
[1:22:44] master. You're no no longer under all
[1:22:46] the rules. You are no longer under the
[1:22:48] legalism that was the Old Testament. You
[1:22:51] respect that and you still know that
[1:22:52] it's true. But now it becomes flesh. Now
[1:22:54] it becomes real. Now, you can make every
[1:22:57] decision according to the word of God
[1:23:00] and not a list of things of rules. Well,
[1:23:04] I'm not allowed to do that. I am allowed
[1:23:06] to do this. I'm not allowed to do that.
[1:23:08] I can't do that. Oh, sorry. I can't I
[1:23:09] can't do that. I can't go over there. I
[1:23:11] can't I can do this. I'm allowed to do
[1:23:12] this. It's not about that anymore. Now,
[1:23:15] that law becomes real in your life when
[1:23:18] you take on that name of Jesus. and you
[1:23:20] receive his spirit into you. And now
[1:23:23] everything that you do is governed
[1:23:26] by the word of God
[1:23:29] and the spirit that gave the word
[1:23:32] and makes it to where every decision
[1:23:34] that you can make is is according to
[1:23:38] God's spirit. And it's not 600 rules as
[1:23:42] in the Old Testament. Now,
[1:23:46] whatever you do, you can do all in the
[1:23:49] name of the Lord Jesus because you are
[1:23:51] one of his. Amen. So, meet those that
[1:23:54] want to be baptized, um, meet the
[1:23:57] deacons in the back. They'll point you
[1:23:59] in the right direction. And friends,
[1:24:02] when we move into this, as we keep going
[1:24:05] with this sermon on the mount, it's
[1:24:07] pivotal. It is a pivotal time in history
[1:24:10] where Jesus took 4,000 years
[1:24:14] of the law from Abraham. Circumcision
[1:24:16] with Abraham brought it and came all the
[1:24:18] way to him. And now he says, "I am the
[1:24:22] fulfillment." And this law can become
[1:24:24] real in your lives.
[1:24:27] As I said, no more about rules and
[1:24:29] regulations.
[1:24:31] Now it's everything that you do, you can
[1:24:32] do in the name of the Lord Jesus. Amen.
[1:24:35] Daniel,
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; when he moves among us,
[1:24:42] all that he does,
[1:24:46] all of his mercy
[1:24:50] and all of his love,
[1:24:53] if a pin of a rider
[1:24:57] could ride every day,
[1:25:02] even this world
[1:25:05] could never contain.
[1:25:09] Oh, I have been blessed.
[1:25:14] [Music]
[1:25:17] Warmth in the winter,

[1:25:46] Oh, I have been blessed.
[1:25:51] [Music]
[1:25:54] I have been blessed.
[1:25:57] God's so good to me
[1:26:01] and precious are his thoughts of you and
[1:26:07] me.
[1:26:08] No way I can count them. There's not
[1:26:13] enough time.
[1:26:16] So I'll just thank him for being so
[1:26:22] kind.
[1:26:24] Oh, God has been good.
[1:26:28] So
[1:26:29] good.
[1:26:31] I have been blessed.
[1:26:38] Arms that can raise,
[1:26:42] a voice that can talk,
[1:26:46] hands that can touch,
[1:26:49] and legs that can walk,
[1:26:53] ears that can listen,
[1:26:57] eyes that can see.
[1:27:00] Oh, I've got to praise him. As long as I
[1:27:05] breathe.
[1:27:07] Oh, I have been blessed.
[1:27:14] Oh, I have been blessed.
[1:27:18] God so good to me
[1:27:22] and precious are his thoughts of you and
[1:27:27] me. No way I can count them. There's not
[1:27:33] enough time.
[1:27:36] So, I'll just thank him for being so
[1:27:42] kind.
[1:27:43] Oh, God has been good.
[1:27:47] So
[1:27:49] good.
[1:27:51] I have been blessed.

[1:28:17] pray,
[1:28:19] stripes that can heal,
[1:28:22] and blood that still saves.
[1:28:26] I have been blessed.
[1:28:33] I have been blessed.
[1:28:36] God so good to me.
[1:28:40] Precious are his thoughts of you and me.
[1:28:47] No way I can count them. There's not
[1:28:52] enough time.
[1:28:55] So I'll just thank him for being so
[1:29:00] kind.
[1:29:01] Oh, God has been good.
[1:29:05] So
[1:29:07] good.
[1:29:09] I have been blessed.
[1:29:13] [Music]
[1:29:15] He's my shoulder to lean on when I am
[1:29:21] down.
[1:29:23] The rock where he leads me when I'm
[1:29:27] overwhelmed.
[1:29:30] This place where he hides me
[1:29:34] under his wing.
[1:29:37] He's not just a song.
[1:29:41] He's a reason I sing.
[1:29:45] Oh, I have been blessed.
[1:29:52] Oh, I have been blessed.
[1:29:55] God so good to me.
[1:29:59] And precious are his thoughts of you and
[1:30:05] me. No way I can count them. There's not
[1:30:11] enough time.
[1:30:14] So I'll just thank him for being so
[1:30:19] kind.
[1:30:21] God has been good.
[1:30:25] So
[1:30:27] good.
[1:30:29] I have been blessed.
[1:30:32] The reason we are blessed
[1:30:36] is because of Jesus Christ in our lives.
[1:30:39] He can bless He can bless you with
[1:30:40] money. He can bless you with fame. We
[1:30:43] bless you with you can be blessed with
[1:30:45] those things but the true blessing is
[1:30:48] that Christ comes into our lives makes a
[1:30:52] change in our lives and now we come into
[1:30:56] these waters that symbolizes our sins
[1:31:00] being washed away by this water with
[1:31:04] Benjamin Lopez
[1:31:06] felt it on his heart
[1:31:09] to make a change in his life when I was
[1:31:12] back here. I always ask why you why are
[1:31:15] you coming to be baptized?
[1:31:18] And he just looked at me and
[1:31:20] he said, "My life."
[1:31:23] Let me tell you, that's why all of us
[1:31:25] are baptized.
[1:31:27] I want a life. I want this life to
[1:31:30] change and I want a life over on the
[1:31:32] other side.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Do you all want that same life?
[1:31:39] [Applause]
[1:31:42] Brother Ben, you want to say something?
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; I I miss I miss the Lord.
[1:31:49] My family brought us into this
[1:31:53] and I just I hope to God my family
[1:31:57] starts coming and I just miss the Lord.
[1:32:04] [Applause]
[1:32:09] It's got to start somewhere,
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; I think it starts right here.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're making this choice and by
[1:32:16] your own confession, you're coming here
[1:32:18] to be baptized in front of these people,
[1:32:20] saying that I am no longer the Benjamin
[1:32:22] Lopez I was. And I am making a change in
[1:32:25] my life. Lord, I am going to make this
[1:32:27] effort by getting baptized. My life is
[1:32:30] going to change. I am going to do my
[1:32:32] best. You'll still fail. And you know,
[1:32:34] we fail, but we continue to strive
[1:32:38] for perfection. We continue to strive
[1:32:41] for Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:33:19] We've been doing this for 2,000 years.
[1:33:22] And I think the same spirit that is here
[1:33:24] this morning is the same spirit that was
[1:33:27] here 2,000 years ago when they were
[1:33:31] baptizing these new Christians. They
[1:33:34] were baptizing these people, young and
[1:33:36] old, that wanted to come and give their
[1:33:39] hearts to the Lord because there was
[1:33:41] something about this man, Jesus, and
[1:33:43] hearing about him that it just cut them
[1:33:46] in their hearts and they wanted to make
[1:33:47] a change. Amen. A little angel just came
[1:33:51] into the baptism. Bless you, sweetheart.
[1:33:57] I asked Caitlyn
[1:34:00] the other day. I said,
[1:34:03] "Why? Why do you want to be baptized?
[1:34:05] And she told me, I believe you said,
[1:34:07] "It's time." All right. Do you have
[1:34:11] something to say, sweetie?
[1:34:15] Let me tell you,
[1:34:18] we speak with our actions
[1:34:21] a whole lot more than we speak with our
[1:34:24] words.
[1:34:25] And this little girl coming in here to
[1:34:27] be baptized in front of all of these
[1:34:29] people saying that I am making a change
[1:34:33] in my young life and I want my sins
[1:34:37] washed away and I want to be a
[1:34:40] Christian.
[1:34:42] And I am so thankful that the Lord can
[1:34:45] get a hold of someone this young and
[1:34:48] sweetheart can save you from so many
[1:34:51] problems down the road. If you stay with
[1:34:53] this and if you serve God and you always
[1:34:56] do your best to do what Jesus wants you
[1:34:58] to do, he will bless your life. He will
[1:35:03] always have you. You will always be his
[1:35:05] child. No matter what happens in the
[1:35:08] future, you are always his child.
[1:35:12] But the more you live for him,
[1:35:15] the better and happier your life will
[1:35:17] be. Do you believe me? Amen.
[1:35:48] [Applause]
[1:35:55] Oh, do you feel good? Do we have more?
[1:35:58] No. Do you feel good?
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. I feel good. It's a good morning.
[1:36:02] It's good day. Daniel, I'll I'll be down
[1:36:06] there in a moment.
[1:36:17] When I'm at my end,
[1:36:20] you're just getting started.
[1:36:24] When I hit a wall,
[1:36:27] you just walk through.
[1:36:30] When I face a mountain,
[1:36:33] you are the maker.
[1:36:36] So, it's got to move.
[1:36:39] [Music]
[1:36:42] When I'm out of faith,
[1:36:45] you are still faithful.
[1:36:48] When I'm at my worst,
[1:36:51] you are still good.
[1:36:54] In all of my questions,
[1:36:57] you are the answer. It all points to
[1:37:02] you.
[1:37:06] Cuz you're the God of the breakthrough.
[1:37:11] When I'm breaking down, you'll be
[1:37:14] working a way through. When there's no
[1:37:18] way out. This one thing I know you're
[1:37:23] still on your throne.
[1:37:26] So whatever I'm feeling, I still got a
[1:37:31] reason to praise.

[1:43:07] You know what? He's still saving the
[1:43:10] sinner. He's still healing the sick. He
[1:43:14] is the same God that watched this
[1:43:18] universe being created at his word. Is
[1:43:21] the same God that is with us today. And
[1:43:23] he's the same God that is guiding us
[1:43:26] through his word.
[1:43:28] Amen. For tonight
[1:43:31] communion service tonight,
[1:43:34] obviously we have an open communion.
[1:43:36] Anyone who asks to take communion is
[1:43:38] welcome to take communion. But make sure
[1:43:41] that you're ready.
[1:43:44] Take it very seriously.
[1:43:46] This is something that we do in
[1:43:49] remembrance of the Lord. He says, "If
[1:43:52] you don't do it, you have no part with
[1:43:55] me. But if you do it unworthily, you're
[1:43:57] guilty of the blood of Jesus Christ."
[1:44:00] Very, very important thing that we're
[1:44:03] doing tonight. So, invite everyone.
[1:44:06] You're welcome to take communion with
[1:44:08] us. And I was at brother Arie.
[1:44:12] I was up baptizing young Caitlyn and I
[1:44:16] got done and um
[1:44:19] I came out of the water and I said, "Are
[1:44:21] you proud, Grandpa?"
[1:44:23] And he said, "It made me cry."
[1:44:31] It does,
[1:44:32] boy. When we see somebody, some family
[1:44:36] come to the Lord, want to be baptized,
[1:44:39] want to make a change in their lives, we
[1:44:42] just
[1:44:44] cry tears of joy.
[1:44:47] And I know
[1:44:49] by the word of God that the angels in
[1:44:51] heaven are rejoicing. and they're
[1:44:54] rejoicing today when we see people
[1:44:56] coming to the Lord young, you know,
[1:44:59] maybe maybe a young girl like Caitlyn
[1:45:02] Caitlyn, maybe somebody in their 30s,
[1:45:04] 40s,
[1:45:05] it may be it may be a 70 or 80 year old
[1:45:10] man or woman.
[1:45:12] The same thing, it's all the same. It's
[1:45:15] Jesus Christ working on that soul
[1:45:19] and making a place. And then we make
[1:45:22] that decision that we want to take on
[1:45:24] that name of Jesus Christ through
[1:45:26] baptism. And therefore,
[1:45:29] we receive eternal life because of Jesus
[1:45:32] Christ. Because we take on that name.
[1:45:36] Amen.
[1:45:48] Lord God, I'm a quote
[1:45:51] your son.
[1:45:54] You said this was called a house of
[1:45:56] prayer where he was
[1:46:00] and I'm so thankful that we can pray
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; with an a
[1:46:06] love you and do what you say.
[1:46:09] And there's symbolism and
[1:46:12] consciousness and
[1:46:16] the creation is so wonderful. Lord, we
[1:46:18] just ask you to help each one of us,
[1:46:21] Lord, to follow you, to obey you and
[1:46:26] love you. That's what you said would
[1:46:28] happen if we loved you. We would obey
[1:46:30] you and then everything would work out
[1:46:32] for our good. So that's a beautiful
[1:46:34] promise, Lord. And you have lots of
[1:46:36] them. And that's the only thing we fear
[1:46:38] is that any of those are left unanswered
[1:46:42] or appreciated. In Jesus Christ's name,
[1:46:45] I thank you for Caitlyn getting baptized
[1:46:48] in the symbolic form of dying to herself
[1:46:54] in the flesh. In Jesus Christ's name, I
[1:46:56] thank you. Amen.
[1:47:01] He's the name above
[1:47:05] all names.
[1:47:09] He's worthy of all praise.
[1:47:14] [Music]
[1:47:16] And my heart will sing
[1:47:19] how great
[1:47:22] is our God.
[1:47:26] [Music]
[1:47:28] And he's the name above
[1:47:33] all names.
[1:47:36] He is worthy of all praise.
[1:47:43] And my heart will sing. How great
[1:47:49] is our God
[1:47:52] [Music]
[1:47:56] and how great
[1:47:59] is our God. Oh, and sing with me. How
[1:48:04] great
[1:48:06] is our God?
[1:48:09] And all we'll see. How great
[1:48:13] how great
[1:48:16] is our God.
[1:48:18] How great is our God.
[1:48:23] And how great
[1:48:26] is our God.
[1:48:29] Sing with me. How great
[1:48:33] is our God?
[1:48:37] All will see how great
[1:48:42] how great
[1:48:45] is our God.
