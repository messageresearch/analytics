[1:39] One more time, brother Michael on that
[1:40] chorus.
[1:42] [Music]
[1:44] Are you washed
[1:48] in the blood?
[1:51] [Music]
[1:52] &gt;&gt; In the soul cleansing blood of the lamb.
[2:00] &gt;&gt; Are your garments
[2:03] spotless? Are they white as snow? Are
[2:09] you washed in the blood of the lamb?
[2:16] &gt;&gt; Our heavenly father,
[2:20] Lord, to be washed in that blood,
[2:23] it means salvation. It means eternal
[2:25] life. Lord, it means everything to us.
[2:28] Lord, we are grateful that we can call
[2:31] ourselves in this day Christians.
[2:34] Father, be with us tonight. We pray. We
[2:37] thank you for a good service this
[2:38] morning. We pray that you're with us
[2:41] tonight, Lord, as we open the word. May
[2:45] it glorify you. And Lord, may it answer
[2:47] questions that are on our hearts. We
[2:50] pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God
[2:53] bless. You can be seated.
[2:58] I got two friends.
[3:02] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[3:03] &gt;&gt; You know, I was standing outside
[3:06] And the deal with not having hair on
[3:09] your head is that if you don't if you
[3:12] stand out there too long, the top of my
[3:14] head sizzles
[3:18] and uh so yeah, got too much sun.
[3:21] Fellowship's been outside this morning.
[3:23] Um it's a it's a special service
[3:26] tonight. I got two two friends here and
[3:29] I want both of them to say a few words.
[3:31] Brother Matt has met. We have uh he's
[3:34] Zach and Zeke's dad. It's good to have
[3:37] you here. And then my dear friend
[3:39] Michael McKenzie from the Carolas from
[3:44] Brother Gerald Gerald Hughes's church.
[3:46] He's a brother Gerald's a good friend.
[3:48] Brother Michael's an old friend. I've
[3:49] known him for a long time. I want both
[3:51] of you if you could both come up and and
[3:54] greet the congregation. Jamie, it's good
[3:56] to see you. God bless you. Welcome. I
[3:59] totally took credit this morning for
[4:01] your marriage.
[4:04] I I said that you met at my house, so I
[4:07] Yeah, I took credit for it. But it's
[4:09] it's good to see you. God bless you.
[4:11] Welcome. Of course, Zach. Good to see
[4:13] you. Brother Matt, come come on up. And
[4:16] if you'd say a few words, Brother Matt
[4:19] goes to a church in Washington State and
[4:23] pastored by a good friend of mine,
[4:25] Brother John Andes.
[4:27] And I asked I said could you just come
[4:29] up and greet the congregation from the
[4:32] church we we would really appreciate it.
[4:34] So brother M bless you. Thank you. Bless
[4:38] you.
[4:43] All right. Well hello everybody. Thanks
[4:46] for uh giving me a couple of moments,
[4:48] pastor. And uh yeah, just wanted to
[4:50] greet the saints on behalf of the church
[4:52] of End Time Message Tabernacle and
[4:54] brotherh John Andes and on behalf of the
[4:57] officers of the church and the saints
[4:58] there, we greet you. It's wonderful to
[5:00] travel about and see other people that
[5:02] are growing in in Christ and uh
[5:05] following and uh so just yeah, we want
[5:08] to greet you and I'll I'll send your
[5:10] greetings back to them when I return. Um
[5:13] I just wanted to pastor said if I had
[5:16] just a couple couple little thoughts and
[5:18] so um I part of also what I wanted to do
[5:21] is thank you as a congregation on behalf
[5:23] um of a father and a mother and my wife
[5:26] just uh some of the role that you played
[5:28] in my son's journey of faith. And so he
[5:32] um
[5:34] well it's a wonder how how how the Lord
[5:37] works in marvelous ways. and he took um
[5:40] I'll back up just really slightly to
[5:42] myself. Uh I was at the age of 18, I
[5:46] said to my parents, I said, "When I
[5:47] graduate high school, I also graduate
[5:49] church." And uh and I and I had a firm
[5:52] belief. I I said I didn't want um a Lord
[5:56] to be over my life. And so uh the Lord
[5:59] has an interesting way to humble us
[6:01] because uh you know, I I just thought I
[6:04] wanted to go my own way in life. And uh
[6:07] and so the Lord by his grace sees me
[6:09] from that point all the way until now
[6:11] and only by his grace humbly trying to
[6:14] walk with him uh to keep humble before
[6:16] him. And so it's a wonder it's a
[6:18] wonderful thing when you see a similar
[6:21] process unfolding in the lives of your
[6:23] sons. And uh and so that's and the
[6:27] Tucson tabernacle plays an interesting
[6:28] role in that because a couple years ago
[6:31] my my son Ezekiel he was finding a
[6:34] different way as well. you know, he was
[6:35] he was away from the church a little
[6:37] bit. He wasn't coming to church so much
[6:39] and um he was just seeking his own way.
[6:42] And so we had a conversation a couple
[6:44] years ago and I could just tell, you
[6:46] know, the enemy wants to put a little
[6:47] bit of fear in there like, you know,
[6:49] your son is wandering and and so you go
[6:51] to prayer as parents and um and
[6:55] sometimes it takes a while. Well, fast
[6:57] forward a couple of years and there was
[6:59] an event here that Katie and Josiah AOT
[7:02] spoke with my son to maybe come video.
[7:05] And so he comes down here and he videos
[7:07] it and then the next thing I know he's
[7:09] he's home. I can't remember the time
[7:10] span. The next thing I know he's
[7:12] thinking about packing his car and
[7:14] headed towards Tucson and and so yeah,
[7:17] and I understand and and then there's an
[7:19] opportunity to live in the the little
[7:21] apartment right next to the Tucson
[7:23] Tabernacle. So, you're just thinking to
[7:24] yourself as a father, well, Lord, I
[7:27] mean, you had a plan all the way along.
[7:29] And so, you know, it's just it's amazing
[7:31] to see how the Lord works. It's um I
[7:35] wanted to encourage anybody who has
[7:37] young one or loved ones that they're
[7:39] praying for. Uh that God is a God of
[7:42] miracles and a God of grace. And
[7:44] sometimes he takes the whole mountain
[7:46] and he moves the whole mountain
[7:47] instantaneously. Other times he takes it
[7:50] dump truck by dump truck. And uh so in
[7:52] my son's case that was it was a little
[7:54] slower process but uh by God's grace his
[7:57] his his journey is headed in a very
[8:00] wonderful direction and uh I'm so
[8:02] grateful to the Lord for that. Um, you
[8:05] know, I was thinking, uh, pastor, that
[8:08] um,
[8:10] you know, the same the same God who
[8:13] those seraraphim were covering up and
[8:15] that was such a I've never really
[8:16] thought about that how they were
[8:17] covering up their face and uh, as if to
[8:20] say, yeah, don't don't look here, you
[8:23] know, look there. But it's that same God
[8:25] who said uh, in the scriptures, you
[8:28] know, is anything too hard for me? And
[8:31] so I I was thinking about that verse
[8:33] this morning or during the afternoon
[8:35] when I was speaking and I I said surely
[8:37] Lord the there is nothing too hard for
[8:39] you. And so yeah, we put our faith in
[8:42] that God who declared that and and we
[8:46] can just say, "Father,
[8:48] I may not know how you're going to do
[8:50] things, but I'm sure interested how
[8:51] you're going to resolve this situation."
[8:53] And we just we just hold that in faith
[8:54] and we trust in the Lord and we put our
[8:57] head down and we keep praying and we um
[9:02] and and I also love be still and know
[9:04] that I am God. And so bless you saints.
[9:08] I will now uh yeah that was
[9:12] [Applause]
[9:22] tell you.
[9:24] So Zeke came down. We all know Zeke. We
[9:26] we love Zeke.
[9:28] And uh Zeke came down and yeah we we put
[9:31] him in jail in the Tucson Tabernacle and
[9:34] he had to he had to live right over here
[9:35] so he couldn't get away. Brother Matt, I
[9:38] do I do appreciate appreciate the
[9:40] family. And you know, when we're praying
[9:43] for someone,
[9:45] our children especially, or maybe a
[9:48] spouse,
[9:50] we never want to put God in a box and
[9:53] say, "God, you have to do it this way."
[9:56] Because it's so easy for us to do that.
[9:59] It's so easy for us to have a path that
[10:02] we think that the Lord should do and we
[10:04] have a destination for our children or
[10:08] our loved one and he never does it like
[10:12] we want it. He's sovereign. He has a
[10:15] way. So, the best thing that we can do
[10:18] is take it out of our hands and we place
[10:23] it in the hands of God. Because let me
[10:27] tell you something. If you didn't
[10:28] already know this, God's hands are much
[10:31] more capable than our hands.
[10:34] &gt;&gt; He's been doing this for 6,000 years.
[10:39] And he knows very well how to bring a
[10:42] soul out of the world.
[10:45] And he can he can no matter how bad
[10:48] things look. I mean, things weren't bad
[10:51] here, but sometimes they are bad.
[10:54] Sometimes you have no idea. Lord, I I
[10:58] have no idea what you can do. I have no
[11:02] idea what's going to happen with this,
[11:04] but Lord, I need this. My son needs
[11:08] this. My daughter needs this. And then
[11:11] you just put it into his hands and watch
[11:13] what he does. He is a miracle working
[11:15] God. He's been doing it for a long time
[11:17] and he does it today. They they say
[11:20] sometimes that, well, the days of
[11:21] miracles are over. No, they're not.
[11:24] Miracles happen and they happen all the
[11:26] time. They happen every day. And really,
[11:29] we've seen miracles in this church.
[11:31] We've seen the sick healed. But when a
[11:34] soul is saved,
[11:37] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, something something
[11:40] changes. Let me let me give a testimony
[11:43] I was given to the kids at lunch.
[11:47] We know that Alex, the Russian guy that
[11:52] uh that was coming, has been coming. I
[11:53] don't know for six months, eight months.
[11:56] We know Alex's wife, Joy.
[12:00] And Joy, she was Joy did not represent
[12:03] Joy. She was not a happy lady.
[12:08] And she would, boy, she she was rough on
[12:11] me and I think she was rough on quite a
[12:13] few of you. And she would wait outside
[12:17] the church
[12:19] and she'd let us have it.
[12:23] and just not
[12:25] a nice person most of the time.
[12:29] Well, I get a
[12:32] text from someone.
[12:35] Maybe it's from Joy. No, because I
[12:37] blocked her on my phone. This is how bad
[12:38] it was. You laugh, but I did. There was
[12:42] a reason I did.
[12:44] And it was because I had to.
[12:47] So, somebody tells me that, hey, you
[12:49] know, Joy, she's finished.
[12:53] and and I was I was she said she's
[12:56] finished with it
[12:58] and I was worried about her. I was
[13:00] worried about maybe she was going to
[13:01] take her own life. I was worried about
[13:03] what was going on in her life.
[13:05] So the next morning I told um I told
[13:09] brother Ed I think it was I said make
[13:12] ready for baptism because I don't know
[13:15] what joy was meaning
[13:18] and you all were most of you were here
[13:22] about threequarters of the way through
[13:23] my sermon
[13:25] Joy walks in. She's never stepped foot
[13:27] in this church.
[13:29] Joy walked in and she sat right about
[13:33] behind where sister Shirley is and she
[13:36] sat next to her husband.
[13:39] And as I was ministering, you know, she
[13:41] has that real firm look. As I was
[13:45] ministering, I could see the face soften
[13:48] up
[13:50] and I could see that she was really
[13:52] thinking.
[13:54] And towards the end of service, I I
[13:57] could see the hard shell
[14:00] The Bible calls it a stony heart. I
[14:03] could see that stony heart start to
[14:05] break a little bit. And then I looked
[14:09] down at her
[14:11] and I said,
[14:14] I think I said, it's on video, you can
[14:15] go back and look at it. I think I said,
[14:17] Joy, I said, God cares about you. God
[14:20] knows you. He knows everything about
[14:23] you, and he cares. And then the tears
[14:26] just started coming down her face.
[14:29] and talked to her for a little while
[14:32] longer right in front of everybody
[14:34] and I said, "Do you want to be
[14:35] baptized?" And she was puckering. That
[14:37] bottom lip was going up and down. And
[14:40] she shook her head.
[14:43] And we brought her up and and a couple
[14:45] of one or two others brought them up and
[14:47] baptized them. This just a few weeks
[14:49] ago.
[14:51] And I'll tell you what, that woman
[14:54] changed.
[14:56] She changed that day
[14:58] and she is the sweetest person now. And
[15:02] I unblocked her and
[15:04] everything everything is is okay. And
[15:08] I'll tell you what, she was hugging the
[15:12] sisters and
[15:14] brother Joe, she came up to me and she
[15:16] grabbed me and she rubbed the top of my
[15:18] head and said, "I love you, pastor.
[15:21] You're not allowed to do that.
[15:24] I love you too, Joy.
[15:28] And and she is she was telling me this
[15:31] morning, she said, "I want to lead my
[15:33] dad to the Lord Jesus."
[15:36] And I just thought, you know, is it
[15:39] worth it?
[15:41] Is doing this. That right there makes it
[15:44] all worth it. That woman had no one. She
[15:49] was by herself. Her husband and her did
[15:52] not get along. He would come to church.
[15:55] He was referred here from another church
[15:58] that we we don't even know. They said
[16:02] Tucson Tabernacle has changed um over
[16:04] the past couple um couple months. And
[16:08] and they told um Alex, they said, you
[16:11] know, you should go try it out because
[16:13] we heard that there's a lot of people
[16:14] starting to go over there.
[16:16] and and he came and you know Alex he's
[16:20] real firm and he's Russian and and you
[16:24] know you go to give him a hug and
[16:27] just I shake hand you know and and
[16:32] but now he's got a wife that loves the
[16:36] Lord and she's happy. She's still going
[16:39] to have troubles. We're all going to
[16:41] have troubles. But things changed in
[16:43] that lady's life. I don't know if I've
[16:44] ever seen a change so much as in Joy. I
[16:49] don't know how many how many know Joy?
[16:51] How many? A lot of you do. Has she not
[16:54] changed? It's it's really a miracle. So,
[16:58] I see that
[17:01] the Lord can do things and he has his
[17:03] time and he has his way. And Joy made
[17:06] the decision herself and she walked down
[17:08] in there and she gave her heart to the
[17:10] Lord Jesus. And now it's like, well,
[17:13] praise God. Praise God. And I will I'm
[17:17] going to have brother Michael if you
[17:18] could come up. Um, but I'll I'll talk
[17:21] about in a little bit the old question
[17:24] that says, "Can a can can you lose your
[17:26] salvation? Is once saved always saved?"
[17:29] Is that correct? Before I want Brother
[17:32] Michael to greet us. Brother Michael's
[17:33] originally from the Congo and he's lived
[17:36] here for a long time. As I as I said,
[17:38] I've known Brother Michael. He's a good
[17:40] friend. He's got a precious family. His
[17:42] do Where's the daughters? Where's the
[17:43] girls?
[17:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Well, next time they're going
[17:48] to come, right,
[17:50] sister? Good to see you. God bless you.
[17:56] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[17:58] It's a joy and a privilege for me to be
[18:01] in front of you, the redeemed of his
[18:04] blood. Are you happy?
[18:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[18:08] As brother Daniel say, he's a good
[18:10] friend of mine and I am blessed to be a
[18:12] friend of yours and to be in our midst,
[18:15] your midst tonight. I just wanted to
[18:18] read one or two scriptures to greet you
[18:21] with those scriptures.
[18:23] And at the same time, I'm bringing
[18:25] greetings from Pastor to you and the
[18:28] whole congregation and from my children.
[18:30] So my wife is sitting over there, sister
[18:32] Stella. She's right there in the back.
[18:35] So I want to read Um
[18:39] in the book of Colossians
[18:42] chapter 3
[18:46] verse 16 it says let the word of Christ
[18:51] dwell in you richly in all wisdom
[18:54] teaching and admonishing one another in
[18:57] psalms and hymns and spiritual songs
[19:00] singing with grace in your hearts to the
[19:03] Lord.
[19:05] That's one of the scriptures I love the
[19:08] most because it talks about the word
[19:12] amongst us, dwelling amongst us. That's
[19:17] where we we draw our strength.
[19:20] And the other one is
[19:23] second Timothy that would be chapter 3
[19:28] verse 16. It is the same about the word.
[19:33] It says, "All scripture is given by
[19:36] inspiration of God and is profitable for
[19:40] doctrine,
[19:42] &gt;&gt; for reproof, for correction, for
[19:45] instruction,
[19:46] in righteousness."
[19:48] &gt;&gt; So everything is laid out there the way
[19:51] the word is going to do for you in
[19:53] righteousness with love. So we love you
[19:57] and we appreciate the grace that the
[20:00] Lord has given to brother Daniel here.
[20:03] I've been in this church.
[20:06] It's been six years. We didn't have any
[20:08] pastor but I had opportunity to visit
[20:11] here.
[20:13] That's what I had to greet with these
[20:16] few words from scripture. God bless you.
[20:20] [Applause]
[20:25] Praise the Lord. God is good.
[20:31] So
[20:32] now I asked for
[20:36] some questions and and I got some really
[20:38] really good questions from the
[20:39] congregation
[20:41] and I I thought that that I could take
[20:44] about 15 minutes, 20 minutes and answer
[20:47] one of these questions that someone
[20:50] wrote in. I don't know who it was but it
[20:53] it's it's an excellent excellent
[20:55] question and and it goes back actually
[20:58] it has divided the Christian church
[21:02] for a long long time and one and one of
[21:06] the things I want to say on these
[21:07] questions
[21:09] that
[21:11] if
[21:12] you have you you probably won't on this
[21:14] one but if you have a really strong
[21:16] feeling one way or the other don't Let a
[21:21] doctrine divide you.
[21:24] &gt;&gt; We have learned that we have no book but
[21:28] the Bible, no law but love,
[21:31] and and no book but the Bible, no law
[21:34] but love, and
[21:37] come on. No creed but Christ. Thank you.
[21:41] And that that's how we believe. And if
[21:44] we can be separated
[21:46] by simple doctrines that even the
[21:49] highest theologians separate on then
[21:51] friends the the spirit of Christ really
[21:54] isn't there. It really isn't among us.
[21:56] So when we are talking about these
[21:59] questions and I'll do my best to answer.
[22:02] Brother Brandham said if there's a Bible
[22:03] question then there's a Bible answer and
[22:06] I'll do my best to answer according to
[22:08] the Bible.
[22:10] But make sure that as we are going
[22:13] through these, take the scriptures that
[22:16] I read, bring them into your heart and
[22:20] then apply them to your life. My
[22:23] interpretation,
[22:25] I could be right, I could be wrong, but
[22:28] the most important thing is that the
[22:30] Bible is read. And then what I want to
[22:32] do is I want to place it into your hands
[22:36] and say, "Now, what do you think about
[22:37] this?" and let the congregation dig into
[22:40] the word. That's my role. My role isn't
[22:43] up here isn't to be up here and have you
[22:45] listen to me as the pastor and you put
[22:50] all of your trust in my interpretation
[22:52] or my revelation. That's not a role of a
[22:55] pastor. It's not the role of a priest.
[22:57] That's not the role of a leader in the
[22:58] church. The the role is to get you
[23:01] excited about the word, to get you to
[23:04] dig in, and then you will receive the
[23:06] blessings from the Bible. The Bible is
[23:08] just full of blessings. Our brother said
[23:10] that all doctrine, all scripture is
[23:14] given by inspiration from God and good
[23:17] for doctrine. So we are permitted by
[23:21] that scripture to open up this word
[23:25] wherever we want to open it up
[23:28] &gt;&gt; and learn from it.
[23:30] &gt;&gt; And it's a blessing to be able to do
[23:32] that. So the question if you were once
[23:35] saved are you always saved?
[23:40] Is this a one-time thing
[23:43] or can you lose your salvation?
[23:47] So we what we here have here is we have
[23:49] a classic
[23:51] um disagreement between Calvinism
[23:54] which is basically you're saved, you're
[23:56] predestinated
[23:58] that there that basically almost you
[24:00] don't have a choice in the matter that
[24:02] you either are or you're not. And then
[24:04] we have the other side we have
[24:06] Armenianism
[24:07] that says no you have to continue to
[24:10] work. You have to continue to serve. You
[24:12] have to con you you can't when you fail
[24:16] you have to repent again and you have to
[24:18] always strive for perfection and yes you
[24:23] can lose your salvation.
[24:25] So let me read some scriptures from both
[24:28] sides
[24:30] and then I'll give you my opinion but
[24:32] it's up to all of us individually to
[24:36] decide.
[24:39] So these passages I'm going to I'm going
[24:42] to read now, these scriptures emphasize
[24:45] emphasize
[24:47] eternal security. Okay? Eternal security
[24:49] is once saved, always saved in salvation
[24:54] for true believers. It says this, and
[24:56] I'm sorry I did not give you these, but
[24:58] let's see how fast you are on your sword
[25:00] drills. John 10 verse 27,
[25:05] Jesus said this. John 10:27, "My sheep
[25:10] hear my voice,
[25:12] and I know them, and they follow me, and
[25:15] I give unto them eternal life, and they
[25:19] shall never perish. Neither shall a man
[25:22] pluck them out of my hand.
[25:26] My father which gave them me is greater
[25:29] than all, and no man is able to pluck
[25:32] them out of my father's hand."
[25:35] So he's saying, "I gave them eternal
[25:37] life. I saved them. I have them in my
[25:40] hand. And there's no one that can pluck
[25:42] them out. There's no way that they could
[25:43] be lost."
[25:46] Romans chapter 8
[25:49] verse 38 says this,
[25:51] one of my favorite scriptures, and I
[25:53] read this often in closing. For I am
[25:56] persuaded
[25:58] that neither death nor life, nor angels,
[26:01] nor principalities, nor powers, nor
[26:04] things present, nor things to come,
[26:10] nor height, nor depth, nor any other
[26:11] creature shall be able to separate us
[26:13] from the love of God which is in Christ
[26:14] Jesus our Lord.
[26:17] No matter what sin you commit, there is
[26:19] nothing that can separate you
[26:22] from the love of God which is in Christ
[26:24] Jesus our Lord. Ephesians chapter 1
[26:27] verse 13 says this
[26:30] speaking of the Lord Jesus I'll read the
[26:32] New King James Version. It says, "In him
[26:36] you also trusted
[26:40] after you heard the word of truth, the
[26:43] gospel of your salvation, in whom also
[26:46] having believed,
[26:48] you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of
[26:51] promise,
[26:53] who is the guarantee of our inheritance
[26:55] until the redemption of the purchased
[26:57] possession to the praise of his glory."
[27:00] The Old King James says, "In whom you
[27:02] also trusted after that you heard the
[27:04] word of truth, the gospel of your
[27:07] salvation. In whom also after that you
[27:10] believed
[27:12] Josiah,
[27:14] you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of
[27:16] promise, what we were talking about
[27:18] earlier, which is the earnest of our
[27:20] inheritance until the redemption of the
[27:23] purchased possession unto the praise of
[27:25] his glory." So you were sealed after you
[27:29] believed.
[27:31] You gave your heart to the Lord. You
[27:33] were sealed.
[27:35] All right? And who can break a seal?
[27:38] Satan can't break that seal. So I
[27:40] believe the author there is saying
[27:43] now
[27:45] other scriptures. Now let's look at the
[27:47] other side.
[27:51] Brother Michael, you probably knew I'd
[27:52] go to this one. Hebrews chapter 6
[27:55] verse4. It says this,
[27:59] "For it is impossible
[28:02] for those who were once enlightened
[28:05] and have tasted of the heavenly gift and
[28:07] were made partakers of the Holy Ghost
[28:09] and have tasted the good word of God and
[28:11] the powers of the world to come, if they
[28:14] shall fall away to renew them unto
[28:17] repentance, seeing that they crucify to
[28:20] themselves the son of God aresh, and put
[28:22] him to an open shame." Little difficult
[28:24] to understand. And let me read the
[28:25] amplified version of that.
[28:28] For it is impossible to restore to
[28:31] repentance
[28:33] those who have once been enlightened
[28:37] spiritually
[28:38] and who have tasted and consciously
[28:41] experienced the heavenly gift and have
[28:44] shared in the holy holy spirit and have
[28:47] tasted and consciously I'm sorry
[28:50] experienced the good word of God and the
[28:53] powers of the age to come.
[28:57] They've experienced of the world to come
[29:02] and then have fallen away.
[29:06] It is impossible to bring them back
[29:08] again to repentance
[29:11] since they again nailed the son of God
[29:13] on the cross.
[29:16] Amplified says, "So as far as they are
[29:18] concerned, they are treating the death
[29:20] of Christ as if they were not saved by
[29:22] it and are holding him up again to
[29:25] public disgrace."
[29:28] So the Apostle Paul here, author of
[29:30] Hebrews,
[29:32] he says, "It's impossible for those who
[29:35] were once enlightened
[29:37] and have tasted of this heavenly gift,
[29:39] if they fall away, it's impossible for
[29:41] them to come back.
[29:46] John 15:6. I know it's a bit of a
[29:49] downer,
[29:51] but it's what the Bible says.
[29:54] John 15:6.
[29:57] If a man abide not in me,
[30:00] he is cast forth as a branch and is
[30:03] withered, and men gather them and cast
[30:06] them into the fire, and they are burned.
[30:08] If you abide in me and my words also
[30:10] abide in you, then you shall ask what
[30:11] you will and it shall be done unto you.
[30:14] New Living Translations a little easier
[30:16] to understand on that one. It says,
[30:17] "Anyone who does not remain in me,
[30:22] remain in me,
[30:25] is thrown away like a useless branch and
[30:28] withers. Such branches are gathered into
[30:30] a pile to be burned. But if you remain
[30:34] in me and my words remain in you, you
[30:36] may ask for anything you want and it
[30:38] will be granted. So remaining is staying
[30:42] which means you are there. Now stay
[30:44] there. But he's saying here but the ones
[30:48] that don't remain they are cast away.
[30:55] 1 Corinthians chapter 9 verse 27.
[30:59] 1 Corinthians 9:27 says this, "But I
[31:03] keep under my bo under my body and bring
[31:07] it into subjection,
[31:10] lest that by any means when I have
[31:12] preached to others, I myself should be
[31:14] cast away."
[31:16] English standard version of that says
[31:18] this very very direct. It says this,
[31:20] "But I discipline my body and keep it
[31:23] under control, lest after preaching to
[31:25] others, I myself should be
[31:28] disqualified."
[31:31] Oh,
[31:33] so now we've seen the other side. You
[31:35] can see how someone can be an Armenius.
[31:40] You see how they could say, "You could
[31:42] lose your salvation." What about Judas?
[31:48] Judas walked with the disciples.
[31:53] Brother Ram said he lost his salvation.
[31:56] His name was taken off the book of life.
[32:01] So what's the answer?
[32:04] Listen to this.
[32:10] Let me read that.
[32:12] Judas when Jesus is praying for his
[32:16] disciples
[32:19] he's in the garden of Gethsemane he says
[32:21] this St. John 17:9,
[32:28] he says, "I pray for them.
[32:34] I pray not for the world, but for them
[32:36] which thou hast given me, for they are
[32:38] thine."
[32:40] Verse 10.
[32:42] All are mine. I'll read the You know
[32:46] what? All are mine. All mine are thine
[32:50] and thine are mine. and I am glorified
[32:53] in them. And now I am no more in the
[32:56] world, but these are in the world. And I
[32:59] come to thee, holy father, keep them
[33:03] through thine own name, those whom thou
[33:05] hast given me, that they may be one as
[33:09] we are one. Now watch verse 12. While I
[33:13] was with them in the world, I kept them
[33:15] in thy name. Those that thou gavest me,
[33:18] I have kept, and none of them is lost.
[33:21] So he's saying that those that you gave
[33:24] me, none of them has lost,
[33:27] but
[33:29] the son of predition that the scripture
[33:32] might be fulfilled. So one was lost,
[33:38] that the scripture might be fulfilled.
[33:40] So this
[33:42] he's Jesus is saying now he's praying
[33:45] down there in the garden but he hasn't
[33:46] yet completely been betrayed. Jesus hu
[33:50] uh Judas hasn't walked up to Jesus and
[33:51] kissed him to identify him to the
[33:55] soldiers. So it hasn't quite happened
[33:58] yet. But here Jesus said
[34:02] that he's lost.
[34:06] So what is it? So, can we lose our
[34:11] salvation? Was Judas ever really saved?
[34:15] It's a good question.
[34:18] It says in Revelation 22 verse 18.
[34:25] says this,"For I testify to everyone who
[34:27] hears the words of the prophecy of this
[34:29] book, that if anyone if any man shall
[34:32] add unto these things, God shall add
[34:35] unto him the plagues that are written in
[34:38] this book. And if anyone takes away from
[34:42] the words of the of the book of this
[34:45] prophecy, God shall take away his part
[34:48] from the book of life, from the holy
[34:51] city, and from the things that which are
[34:54] written in this book,
[35:01] shall take his part
[35:03] from the book of life,
[35:06] out of the book of life.
[35:08] So again,
[35:11] you see how there can be two sides to
[35:13] this. You can you see how these
[35:15] theologians, they go back and forth and
[35:17] back and forth for years. Is it or is it
[35:20] not? So what do you think? Has anyone
[35:23] changed their mind?
[35:25] I think we had a almost a consensus
[35:28] before that you can't lose your
[35:30] salvation. Has anyone changed their
[35:33] mind?
[35:35] Michael says,
[35:42] Let me uh let me give you my thought
[35:45] on this
[35:48] and
[35:49] studying and studying the message and
[35:51] and it's it's back and forth and in
[35:55] studying the the theologians and and
[35:57] what they say really it's back and
[35:59] forth. But listen to this.
[36:03] God is talking to Job.
[36:07] All right. Job is complaining. He Job
[36:10] had gone through a really, really hard
[36:11] time obviously. And Job is kind of
[36:15] complaining to God.
[36:17] And God tells Job, he says, "Listen."
[36:21] And watch the story that God tells Job.
[36:26] He says, "You think you're good, Job?
[36:29] Where were you when I laid the found?"
[36:31] I'm going to read the New King James.
[36:32] Job Job 38:4.
[36:35] Where were you when I laid the
[36:38] foundations of the earth?
[36:43] Declare if thou hast understanding. He
[36:45] says, "Tell me if you understand."
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Who determined its measurements? Surely
[36:52] you know,
[36:54] Job. Surely you know these things. If
[36:56] you're so good, sure you surely you know
[36:59] how I created the heavens and the earth,
[37:01] right, Job?
[37:03] Who determined in the measurements?
[37:04] Surely you know. Or who stretched the
[37:06] line upon it to what were its
[37:09] foundations fastened or who laid its
[37:11] cornerstone. So he's talking about the
[37:13] creation of the world. He's going way
[37:15] back. It's it's important to set the
[37:16] context here. He's this goes way back.
[37:20] Now watch what he says.
[37:23] Verse number seven.
[37:26] When the morning stars sang together and
[37:28] all the sons of God shouted for joy,
[37:33] the sons of God
[37:36] were there.
[37:38] They were shouting for joy when God
[37:40] created all of this.
[37:44] So if they were there way back then,
[37:50] then how can you lose your salvation?
[37:54] if you were in God eternally
[37:57] because we were there. I believe I was
[37:58] there. I don't remember it obviously,
[38:00] but I believe I was there and I was
[38:01] shouting. I was like, "Yes, yeah. Look
[38:04] at this world. Look at these stars. Look
[38:06] at all of this. Praise the Lord. This is
[38:08] all this is awesome." I was there and I
[38:10] was shouting. I was just praising God
[38:12] just like the serarapums we heard this
[38:14] morning that they were they were there
[38:17] and they were covering their face and
[38:18] they were covering their feet and they
[38:20] were flying around and they were looking
[38:21] at each other and they were saying holy
[38:24] holy unto the Lord. They were looking at
[38:25] each other and praising God saying how
[38:27] great he was. And there I was,
[38:31] brother Matt, there I was at the
[38:35] foundation of the world and I was
[38:37] shouting for joy.
[38:40] And what does that have to do with this?
[38:44] So
[38:46] let's go to Revelation chapter 13
[38:50] verse 5. So we've established here that
[38:53] the sons of God were there for way back.
[38:57] Revelation 13 says this.
[39:01] And there was given unto him
[39:04] a mouth speaking great things
[39:08] and blasphemies and power was given unto
[39:10] him to continue 40 and two months. And
[39:13] he opened his mouth in blasphemy against
[39:15] God to blaspheme his name and his
[39:18] tabernacle and them that dwell in
[39:21] heaven. And it was given unto him to
[39:23] make war with the saints. We're talking
[39:25] about the enemy here. And it was given
[39:28] unto him to to make war with the saints
[39:30] and to overcome them. And the power was
[39:32] given him over all kindreds and tongues
[39:34] and nations. And all that dwell upon the
[39:37] earth shall worship him whose names are
[39:40] not written
[39:43] whose names are not written in the book
[39:48] of life. So all these that are
[39:50] worshiping the beast,
[39:52] their names are not written in that
[39:54] book.
[39:57] of life of the lamb slain before the
[40:01] foundation of the world.
[40:04] That's longer than 2,000 years ago.
[40:07] So that goes way back also before God
[40:12] even created the heavens and the earth.
[40:14] So here Jesus is way back before the
[40:17] earth was created. He was slain. And it
[40:20] was in God's plan to to slay his son
[40:24] Jesus so that we all may be saved. And
[40:27] here we are and we're shouting for for
[40:29] joy and we're we're we're rejoicing in
[40:31] all of this. So this salvation plan is
[40:35] not just for the 75
[40:39] and a half years average that we are
[40:41] here on earth. It goes way back to the
[40:44] the beginning
[40:46] that God chose us.
[40:49] He tells us in the book of Ephesians
[40:50] that we are predestinated. He knew.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Now here's the issue. So I am saying yes
[40:58] I actually I agree with everyone most
[41:00] people here that yes we are saved
[41:04] eternally.
[41:06] If the lamb was slain before the
[41:08] foundation of the of the world that's
[41:11] when I was saved.
[41:14] It came to pass
[41:17] 2,000 years ago when Jesus was here.
[41:20] My life was predestined to be here. It
[41:23] came to pass.
[41:25] And now I'm here and I have given my
[41:28] heart to the Lord Jesus. And I believe
[41:30] on him.
[41:33] And when someone truly gives their heart
[41:37] to the Lord,
[41:39] they truly become a Christian. They get
[41:42] saved.
[41:43] and they backslide.
[41:47] I really believe
[41:49] that that person always has a desire in
[41:53] their heart to serve the Lord.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; I don't believe it ever leaves. If they
[41:57] truly are saved, if they truly give
[42:01] their heart to the Lord, no matter how
[42:03] bad they may be,
[42:05] I really believe that there is always
[42:07] something in there that wants to get
[42:08] right. And as I said at the beginning,
[42:11] we don't put God in a box and neither do
[42:13] we put each other in a box and judge
[42:15] them and say here is how you have to be.
[42:19] There is one there is one exclusive club
[42:23] and it's not
[42:26] anything other than Jesus Christ and him
[42:29] crucified.
[42:31] That is exclusive to salvation. You must
[42:35] believe that.
[42:38] So if you truly believe that and if you
[42:40] truly have given your heart to the Lord
[42:42] and then you fall away,
[42:46] then
[42:47] you're just making life hard on
[42:49] yourself.
[42:51] You are.
[42:53] And life is not going to be good. I have
[42:55] never met I've never seen someone that
[42:57] gave their heart to the Lord and then
[43:00] backslid. And I know a lot of them that
[43:02] have and their life got better. Never.
[43:06] or they had more joy in their life.
[43:08] Never. The enemy is so tempting.
[43:12] He is so the I read this morning in
[43:15] Isaiah and Ezekiel about how attractive
[43:18] he is, how beautiful he is, how much
[43:24] he is desired
[43:26] and in how he does things. And he is so
[43:30] tempting and it may be it could be
[43:32] anything. It could be,
[43:35] it could be wealth, it could be sex,
[43:39] it could be popularity, it could be just
[43:42] fitting in with the other kids. He is so
[43:46] good at what he does. And then he will
[43:49] always bring you down and ruin your life
[43:54] and make your life harder. Always. But
[43:57] we make that decision. We make that
[44:00] decision. I am going to choose to sin.
[44:03] And it never works out good ever.
[44:07] And then we have to we go all the way
[44:08] down this road. Say we start right here.
[44:11] We're doing good. And then you know
[44:12] what? I'm going to go all the way down
[44:14] this road of sin all the way to here and
[44:18] I got to go all the way back down that
[44:20] road to get back. You don't go down the
[44:23] road of sin and then all of a sudden
[44:26] your life just gets better. You have to
[44:28] go down the road of repentance. You have
[44:30] to make it right. And that is a child of
[44:32] God. A child of God. He's saved. I
[44:36] believe he is eternally saved. I believe
[44:38] the Lord has his hand. Jesus said that
[44:41] no man can I chose them. He says you
[44:45] didn't choose me. I chose you.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; And he and he says that no one can pluck
[44:50] you out of my hand. Never. But we make
[44:54] the decision to ruin our lives. Our
[44:58] children,
[44:59] loved ones make that decision to
[45:01] completely ruin their life. And they
[45:04] look like they're lost. They look like
[45:05] everything is bad in their lives. And
[45:07] they suffer. They suffer. They suffer
[45:11] until they come back to the Lord. And
[45:13] then they still suffer for what they
[45:14] did. They make make decisions in
[45:17] marriage. They might make decisions of
[45:20] of drugs or alcohol or whatever. and it
[45:22] might hurt their body and they might
[45:24] have to live with that for the rest of
[45:25] their life. But their soul is okay.
[45:30] We sin in the flesh and we suffer in the
[45:34] flesh. But when you come back to the
[45:37] Lord, then that soul is in good shape.
[45:41] That soul is fine. But we still have to
[45:44] suffer for what we've done because we're
[45:46] here in the flesh. But eternally, no.
[45:50] eternally. I believe
[45:54] that once we are saved
[45:57] that we are always saved, but I don't
[45:58] believe it just happened here on earth.
[46:01] I believe God chose me before the
[46:03] foundation of the world and I was in him
[46:06] before the foundation of the world. I
[46:08] was one of those ones that was shouting
[46:10] for joy. I was one of those ones that
[46:13] witnessed all of these things that were
[46:16] created in the world and the sun and the
[46:19] moon. And I shouted for joy. And I think
[46:21] that I was really shouting for joy.
[46:25] I mean, I I'm I love the creation.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; But I think I was really shouting for
[46:30] joy because I was redeemed
[46:32] &gt;&gt; because the lamb was slain before the
[46:34] foundation of the world and I was put in
[46:37] that lamb's book of life. Feel good?
[46:41] &gt;&gt; All right. Any anybody? So, we uh the
[46:44] question
[46:46] I believe I answered the question as far
[46:48] as I I know. Any other any other
[46:51] questions on this subject before we
[46:54] close? Brother Michael, where's brother
[46:55] Michael? You can you and the the worship
[46:58] team can come. Any other questions on
[47:00] this?
[47:06] Can you imagine? Think about that.
[47:10] Before the foundation of the world,
[47:14] the sons of God shouted for joy. I love
[47:19] the way God was saying it, saying like,
[47:21] "Oh, Job, you know, oh, you oh, do you
[47:24] know how I did this? You're so smart."
[47:29] But then he puts in there that when all
[47:31] this happened, they were shouting for
[47:33] joy. Can you imagine just that thought
[47:36] that I was there? And if you're a son or
[47:38] a daughter of God, I believe you are
[47:40] there, too.
[47:41] And there's nothing that could pluck me
[47:44] out of his hand.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Nothing at all. Amen.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Aaron said the prodigal son
[48:00] when he left the house, ah, beautiful.
[48:04] When the when the prodical son left the
[48:06] house, he said, "I want my inheritance
[48:08] now." His dad says, "Okay." Gives him
[48:12] his money. You know what he does with
[48:13] his inheritance? He goes gets
[48:16] prostitutes,
[48:18] drinks it away,
[48:21] spends it all,
[48:24] live, backslides, lives terrible
[48:28] all the way till he's spent all of his
[48:30] money. Now, Satan really got a hold of
[48:32] him. It's like, "Oh, you're having fun.
[48:33] good job. Drink and smoke and and and do
[48:36] all these things. Enjoy yourself. This
[48:38] is living. This is good. And here he is.
[48:40] He's enjoying it. And he think he thinks
[48:42] he's loving life. And then he finds
[48:45] himself.
[48:46] Wow. I don't have any money left. I
[48:48] don't have a job.
[48:50] And I'm just trying. I'm so hungry. I'm
[48:54] feeding these pigs. I'm so hungry that I
[48:57] would love to just eat this slop that
[49:00] I'm giving to the pigs.
[49:03] And then he thought,
[49:06] I wonder if dad would take me back.
[49:09] I'll live I'll live in the quarters with
[49:11] the servants. Oh, can you imagine? I'll
[49:14] live if he would just take me back,
[49:17] Lord. If you would just forgive me of my
[49:20] sins, Lord, if you would just I've gone
[49:24] so far, Lord.
[49:27] I if you would just just forgive me.
[49:32] And he comes,
[49:34] makes his decision, and he starts
[49:37] walking back. And you know, he's
[49:38] thinking about this the whole time.
[49:39] What's dad going to say?
[49:42] I have completely I'm sure mom was
[49:44] worried about me all this time. And I've
[49:47] been out and he knows what I've been
[49:48] doing with with the prostitutes. And he
[49:50] knows I've been doing the drugs and he
[49:52] knows I've been drinking and he knows he
[49:54] knows I've been doing all these things.
[49:56] He's He's going to throw me out. He's
[49:58] not going to accept me in. And then here
[50:00] he comes and his dad
[50:03] sees him coming down the road.
[50:06] And his dad rejoices
[50:09] and he says, "Go kill the fatted calf."
[50:10] He says, "We are going to celebrate
[50:13] because my prodical son has returned."
[50:15] That's us.
[50:17] No matter what we do, no matter how far
[50:19] we go, no matter how much we sin, here
[50:22] is our father. And his hands are out and
[50:25] he says this. He says, "Come unto me
[50:29] all you that are burdened and heavy
[50:31] laden." And he says, "I will give you
[50:34] rest."
[50:36] Beautiful story. No matter how far you
[50:38] go, he was still a son. He could not, no
[50:42] one could deny that he was still that
[50:45] man's son. And no one can deny that I
[50:49] and you are am a son or a daughter of
[50:52] Jesus Christ. You can't deny it. I'm
[50:55] there. He chose me before the foundation
[50:58] of the world.
[51:00] I love him. He's everything to me. And
[51:03] no matter how far I go, no matter how
[51:05] much I sin, he's my Lord. He's my
[51:07] Savior. And he'll accept me in because
[51:11] he said no one can pluck him pluck me
[51:13] from his hand.
[51:15] I may, as someone said, I may have made
[51:19] the decision
[51:21] to go. I think it was Jamie, maybe. I
[51:23] may have made the decision to go,
[51:26] but
[51:28] he was waiting there the whole time. And
[51:31] now I make the decision
[51:35] to come back.
[51:37] And here we are at home with Father,
[51:41] Brother Michael.
[51:43] Amazing
[51:48] [Music]
[51:54] grace
[51:57] shall always be my song of praise.
[52:05] For it was grace
[52:10] that taught my heart to fear.
[52:15] [Music]
[52:18] I do not know
[52:23] just why he came to love me so.
[52:30] He looked beyond
[52:35] my foe and saw my need.
[52:43] And I shall forever
[52:48] lift my eyes to Calary.
[52:56] To view the cross
[53:01] where Jesus
[53:03] died for me.
[53:08] Oh, how marvelous
[53:11] [Music]
[53:14] his grace that called my falling soul.
[53:22] He looked beyond
[53:26] my fault and saw my need.
[53:34] He's
[53:37] wonderful.
[53:39] And I I truly believe no Satan tells us
[53:44] you're lost. I have seen
[53:48] people take their own lives
[53:52] for the very reason
[53:54] people that I know for the very reason
[53:56] that they said that I am beyond
[53:59] forgiveness.
[54:01] I am beyond redemption.
[54:04] I've seen people actually kill
[54:06] themselves. Didn't see it with my own
[54:07] eyes, but I knew them very well. I
[54:10] talked to one person or he left a
[54:12] message on my phone the very day that he
[54:15] took his life.
[54:17] And his words were, "I I can't come back
[54:19] from this."
[54:22] He just lost hope.
[54:24] I'll tell you,
[54:26] wherever Christ is, there is hope. He
[54:29] loves us no matter how much we do.
[54:34] Brother Michael, I don't think that any
[54:36] of us.
[54:38] I don't think we could ever forsake our
[54:39] child.
[54:41] But the love of God far outweighs the
[54:46] love of a parent. Far.
[54:50] He will never leave us or forsake us is
[54:52] what he said.
[54:54] For I am persuaded
[54:57] that neither death nor life,
[55:00] nor angels, nor principalities, nor
[55:02] powers, nor things present, nor things
[55:05] to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any
[55:08] other creature shall be able to separate
[55:11] us from the love of God, which is in
[55:14] Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen. There's
[55:17] nothing, friends. Brother Tony, if you
[55:19] would come and close,
[55:21] brother Michael
[55:24] [Music]
[55:25] I shall forever
[55:29] [Music]
[55:31] lift my eyes to Calary
[55:36] [Music]
[55:39] to view the cross
[55:44] where Jesus
[55:46] died for me.
[55:48] [Music]
[55:51] How marvelous
[55:56] his grace
[55:58] on my falling soul.
[56:05] He looked beyond
[56:09] my fault and saw my
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand for prayer, please.
[56:21] Dear heavenly father,
[56:24] blessed are we
[56:27] that were able to sit at this service
[56:29] today and hear these words.
[56:34] I'm just so thankful for this
[56:37] congregation and and for the pastor and
[56:39] the the message that was preached
[56:41] tonight.
[56:46] Father, as we go
[56:48] and enjoy the rest of the evening, Lord,
[56:50] we just we just pray that
[56:55] your will be done in our lives and in
[56:58] this congregation,
[57:05] that we would be filled with the Holy
[57:07] Spirit. Amen.
[57:10] [Music]
[57:13] We just give you thanks, Lord.
[57:17] You are so
[57:19] [Music]
[57:21] merciful.
[57:24] And
[57:27] thank you. Thank you, Father. Amen.
[57:36] I think there's a time
[57:39] if I was saved when the lamb was slain.
[57:43] But there's still a time when I realized
[57:46] I'm saved.
[57:48] And I'll tell you what, that is a happy
[57:51] happy time when we realize our names are
[57:54] on that book and no one can take it
[57:57] away.
[57:59] God bless you, friends.
