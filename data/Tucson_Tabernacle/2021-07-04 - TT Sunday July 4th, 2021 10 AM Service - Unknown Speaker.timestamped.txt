[35:14] amen god bless you while we're standing
[35:18] we'll pray
[35:21] and just ask god to minister us to us
[35:24] today lord as we
[35:26] we've come this sunday morning honor of
[35:30] the resurrection
[35:33] we sing that song jesus paid it all all
[35:36] to him
[35:36] i own sin had left
[35:39] such a crimson stain but your blood
[35:43] covered all and washed it white as snow
[35:45] lord it's our confidence we place it in
[35:49] in the work that you've done lord
[35:51] because nothing that we could do nothing
[35:53] that i could do would
[35:55] would be sufficient to pay any any debt
[35:58] lord
[35:59] but jesus paid it all lord so we come
[36:02] this morning honoring the resurrection
[36:04] this morning
[36:06] honoring you lifting your name on high
[36:08] lord
[36:10] and we thank you because you said where
[36:11] two or three are gathered you'd be in
[36:13] our midst lord
[36:14] and you'll keep your word lord we're
[36:17] trusting in that we surrender to that
[36:19] now
[36:20] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[36:23] amen
[36:24] while you're standing we'll read one
[36:26] scripture
[36:28] then you may be seated thank you
[36:30] musicians
[36:32] and the book of psalms verse chapter 19
[36:35] and verse 9
[36:39] and it's just to open this morning
[36:43] the fear of the lord is clean enduring
[36:46] forever
[36:48] the judgments of the lord are true and
[36:51] righteous altogether
[36:54] it's clean it's wholesome it it's worth
[36:58] i don't know how else to do you think of
[37:00] the word clean
[37:02] unmoored drinkable touchable
[37:05] something you would eat it's clean it's
[37:08] everything you have need of
[37:11] when you respect and reverence him he
[37:13] says
[37:14] enduring forever and the judgment
[37:17] his thoughts his commandments everything
[37:20] that he does he issues
[37:22] of the lord are true they never fail
[37:25] and are righteous all together so amen
[37:28] you may be seated
[37:34] grateful to the goodness of the lord
[37:37] today
[37:37] and all that he's done for us
[37:40] undeserving as we are
[37:42] but he still does so just a couple of
[37:45] announcements to
[37:47] to remind you of just the morning
[37:50] service today
[37:52] the evening service is cancelled
[37:56] quite a few of the folks are out of town
[37:57] that let us know they'd be gone
[38:00] this weekend and i know it's this summer
[38:03] and
[38:03] folks do travel and i believe there's a
[38:05] youth
[38:06] or some kind of a meeting
[38:10] or what would you call it a camp meeting
[38:12] or all that the youth have gone to
[38:13] and stuff so those that are traveling
[38:17] those that will be out in the camps then
[38:19] and
[38:20] may the lord bless each one of them and
[38:22] grant the desires of their heart so
[38:25] and then on sunday i believe it's july
[38:28] 25th
[38:29] the last sunday of july
[38:33] we will have the morning service and
[38:35] then a potluck lunch
[38:37] and then that afternoon a church
[38:39] business meeting
[38:41] we had intended to do it today and then
[38:44] as soon as we announced it then quite a
[38:46] few folks responded saying they would be
[38:48] gone this weekend and wanted to be part
[38:50] of that
[38:50] so um we just needed to get it out so we
[38:54] could get some response too
[38:56] and and again so that gives us a couple
[38:58] of sundays
[39:00] between now and that last sunday if you
[39:03] have thoughts if you have something you
[39:04] would like to express
[39:05] and you would write it down or just to
[39:08] give us an opportunity to begin to
[39:10] to see what's in the hearts of the you
[39:12] know some of you folks are faithful in
[39:14] letting us know
[39:16] and others we don't hear about it till
[39:18] the meeting so
[39:20] what preparation we can do and we're
[39:23] just trusting in the lord
[39:25] i know that we were up at the minister's
[39:27] meeting
[39:28] uh last week and myself brother lyle and
[39:30] brother peter
[39:32] and um folks at brothers that
[39:35] you know want to know what's going on
[39:37] what's happening
[39:39] and there's a church up there that's
[39:40] going through the same thing so that
[39:42] the ministering brother who was helping
[39:44] out just had questions but
[39:48] i think probably the most common
[39:49] response is you don't have a pastor yet
[39:53] and then but it also opens up the door
[39:56] again because i've heard from
[39:59] different folks different brothers who
[40:02] as one brother said i want to put my
[40:04] name in the hat
[40:06] another brother spoke to us so um
[40:10] lord knows who who we are to have or how
[40:13] it's going to be but
[40:14] in the meantime let's press forward as a
[40:18] family let's continue to to work
[40:20] continue to pray continue to love one
[40:23] another encourage one another
[40:26] and um and see what god has for us
[40:29] we had spoken to brother tim cross last
[40:31] month i believe it was about
[40:33] him possibly coming out the last
[40:36] minister's meeting he was here in in
[40:38] arizona so i got to see him there he was
[40:40] ministering for one of the other
[40:41] churches so there's a possibility that
[40:43] brother tim cross
[40:45] could be coming this month to minister
[40:47] one possibly one of the weekends so
[40:49] we'll just trust in what the lord would
[40:51] allow us to do and
[40:53] in the the prayer request for brother
[40:56] kurt brown's great-granddaughter brother
[41:00] had had a opportunity to speak to
[41:02] brother curt
[41:03] i believe he said thursday and the young
[41:06] young girl she's four years old they are
[41:08] working on putting the fingers all back
[41:10] together she did not lose them
[41:13] but they're at st joe's in in phoenix i
[41:16] believe
[41:16] one of the hospitals up there they're
[41:18] working to restore
[41:20] and um i would just pray that god would
[41:23] would lead those
[41:24] surgeons as doctors
[41:27] talking with my dad he just had an mri
[41:30] he's been going through some
[41:32] some difficulties and all and dad got
[41:35] injured i believe it was in 1974 from
[41:38] his back
[41:40] the doctor told him then you're walking
[41:43] i cannot guarantee
[41:44] that if i do surgery on you that you'll
[41:47] be walking when i'm done
[41:49] he said so i i would just leave that
[41:51] alone
[41:52] but today by the grace of god the
[41:54] doctors and god has given them the
[41:56] knowledge and wisdom to be able to do
[41:58] things today that
[41:59] we would have never thought being been
[42:01] able to to do
[42:03] and so if that's the way the lord wants
[42:06] to work then
[42:07] we just ask him to to guide their hands
[42:10] especially for that little one that
[42:11] little one doesn't know why and
[42:13] and how to deal with it and and maybe
[42:15] sometimes that's better
[42:18] because when when we get into a
[42:20] situation we try to work it out
[42:22] the little child there may not
[42:24] understand and then they can turn and
[42:25] put their trust
[42:27] and i'd say sometimes we should be like
[42:29] children with god
[42:30] lord i don't know how to deal with this
[42:32] so i'm not even going to try i'm just
[42:33] going to lay it in your hands and let
[42:35] you have
[42:35] have your own way so we'll just
[42:38] continue to believe and trust in the
[42:40] lord so
[42:43] brother lyle spoke on on wednesday night
[42:49] of the two influences than in paul's day
[42:52] in our day
[42:53] and it's a great and a strong influence
[42:56] there's no question about it
[42:59] because there's only two spirits in this
[43:00] world
[43:02] they can manifest themselves in
[43:04] different ways god manifests
[43:05] manifests himself in various ways you
[43:08] can't put him in a box and say
[43:10] this is only god only this
[43:13] but he's infinite and and and he
[43:16] manifests himself
[43:18] but satan does it in every manner that
[43:20] he can because all he has ever done is
[43:22] copy
[43:24] he's not he's not original at all
[43:27] but he manifests himself in many
[43:29] different ways and and um
[43:32] there's a way that seems seemeth right
[43:34] to a man
[43:35] it looks good in the beginning the the
[43:37] start of the journey the the plans the
[43:39] thoughts that you might
[43:40] have but if it's not
[43:43] through god then it's death because
[43:45] that's all satan has ever produced
[43:47] is death so
[43:50] as he was thinking that i knew what the
[43:52] lord had put in my heart
[43:54] from a scripture i had read and it just
[43:55] started to
[43:57] to kind of just stay there and think
[43:59] about it and
[44:01] listen to what what some of the brothers
[44:04] spoke at the minister's meeting and some
[44:05] of the conversations we had and
[44:09] god is not a god in confusion he's not
[44:12] the author of confusion
[44:14] and sometimes you might look at
[44:16] something and they look so opposite
[44:19] and and or something looks so good
[44:24] but it's not what it is it's it's a
[44:26] cover over it it's
[44:28] what they call a facade like the the
[44:29] front of a store a storefront
[44:32] and ty says you to come in and then you
[44:34] open the door and what's inside is
[44:36] you were expecting a whole lot more than
[44:38] what the front was
[44:40] so these two thoughts that we're kind of
[44:42] working together here
[44:43] is the thought of
[44:47] that that we are here on this earth
[44:51] and there's a work to do and we're here
[44:55] until he says we're done yes and he
[44:57] knows that time in that day
[45:00] now my heart says even so come quickly
[45:02] lord jesus
[45:04] but i find myself being a little bit um
[45:08] what's where i were to use thinking
[45:11] about myself because i don't want to
[45:12] deal with this anymore
[45:15] you know i i just okay lord come take me
[45:18] home i don't want to deal with this
[45:19] anymore
[45:19] just just take your bride home let's
[45:23] but there are those others that there
[45:25] should out people out there that should
[45:27] touch our hearts and so god like you had
[45:30] mercy on me
[45:31] have mercy on them god has not shown me
[45:35] not given me the vision or the ability
[45:37] to see who is and who isn't
[45:39] therefore my attitude is that could be
[45:41] one also
[45:43] brother greene used to tell us who's my
[45:46] neighbor
[45:47] anyone that crosses the path of my life
[45:50] and so there was that thought of even so
[45:53] come quickly lord jesus
[45:56] because he said he would but there's
[45:59] also work to do
[46:02] and then the other part of is
[46:05] is and i'm going to have the brothers
[46:08] play the quote
[46:09] it's it's a few minutes long it's from
[46:12] questions and answers
[46:14] right after the sixth seal
[46:17] and the question was asked so as we as
[46:21] as evangelists or so should we stop now
[46:25] now that the seals have been unveiled
[46:27] should we stop evangelizing
[46:29] it's over and and
[46:33] so part of me is saying let's go home
[46:35] and the other part of me is saying
[46:37] no they're still souls out there i still
[46:41] have loved ones i
[46:42] still have friends i still have you know
[46:44] i
[46:45] want to see i want him to to come to
[46:47] that same place
[46:48] that i by the grace of god have gotten
[46:50] to to know him
[46:51] so showing brother brother lau was
[46:56] speaking what he was saying and saying
[46:58] lord we want out of here
[47:01] and we want even so come quickly lord
[47:03] jesus
[47:05] but i also want my brother my sister my
[47:08] neighbor
[47:09] to have the same opportunity so the
[47:11] first quote there
[47:13] let your light so shine before men
[47:16] and i know that it's hard to read up
[47:18] there and that's one of the reasons i
[47:20] want them to play the second quote
[47:22] because it would be hard to read but
[47:26] this was the quote of the day here just
[47:29] last week that voice of god put puts up
[47:32] every
[47:32] day so i read that and then i went in
[47:36] and and took that message and i said
[47:39] i'll read up to that point
[47:41] to see what brother band was saying
[47:45] and the first 80
[47:49] paragraphs brother branham is dealing
[47:50] with everything but the message
[47:54] he's talking about the plans he's
[47:56] talking about they had baby dedication
[47:57] and all
[47:58] and then he gets into this and what
[48:00] brought this
[48:01] thought was he was driving down the road
[48:04] and there was
[48:05] a a advertisement a sign up that said
[48:08] are you hungry
[48:10] just those three words and
[48:13] down at the bottom says three miles
[48:15] ahead
[48:17] and that's all the sign said so he began
[48:20] to talk about a sign an advertisement
[48:22] it's usually
[48:23] uh there's something about a sign that
[48:25] catches your attention
[48:26] they make it in a way to make sure they
[48:28] get your attention and
[48:29] whatever it is but he goes it was just
[48:31] kind of interesting that it just says
[48:32] are you hungry
[48:33] three miles ahead so he began to talk
[48:37] about
[48:38] the advertisement and this is the quote
[48:39] where that comes from
[48:41] let your light so shine before men
[48:44] now the only way that the world will
[48:47] ever see christ
[48:48] is when they see it in you and me
[48:52] that's the only way they'll ever see
[48:54] christ they're conscious
[48:55] or numb to the sunsets to the call of
[48:57] the birds
[48:58] to the leaves and the grass and the
[49:01] flowers and the music and the message
[49:03] and so forth
[49:05] that we enjoy after we've found christ
[49:08] but until we get to the place that we
[49:10] display christ
[49:12] now remember that each one of you from
[49:14] tonight on remember
[49:16] you are god's billboards and you're
[49:19] god's advertising agent
[49:21] now the world will look at you to see
[49:23] what christ is
[49:24] so we don't want to smear a big lot of
[49:27] stuff out there
[49:28] that testify testify about things that
[49:31] we
[49:32] really are not let's first be that
[49:36] then when we be that then the world will
[49:38] see
[49:39] christ in you and me
[49:43] so for some people if i could put it
[49:46] this way you're their hope
[49:49] when they see you how do i get what you
[49:52] haven't
[49:53] that peace that that that satisfaction
[49:56] that no matter in all the turmoil and
[49:58] everything that is going on
[49:59] there's something about you that shows
[50:02] peace
[50:02] that shows an atmosphere that's pleasant
[50:05] to be around
[50:07] now some i i caught that because i
[50:09] caught it myself too
[50:11] not always no we're not always pleasant
[50:14] to be around
[50:15] but there's something catches us quickly
[50:18] and says you ought not to be that way
[50:20] you ought to make that right you you
[50:22] know rather than go on and go on and go
[50:25] on and go on and live that way but he's
[50:27] telling
[50:27] you're god's billboard people are
[50:30] looking at you say you say you're a
[50:32] christian
[50:33] let's see what happens let's see how you
[50:36] handle the situation let's see
[50:39] is this product that you are advertising
[50:41] is it genuine
[50:42] does it really do what you say it does
[50:47] so then the question is asked so
[50:50] here's the other side you're god's
[50:52] advertising agent
[50:53] but other side of me says lord come take
[50:55] me home
[50:58] so let's go to that quote and it's in
[51:01] 63 the seals question and answers
[51:04] and that first line 174 should
[51:07] evangelists continue on the field and
[51:10] brother branham begins to speak on that
[51:12] if they'll play that right now
[51:15] it's a few minutes long and just you can
[51:18] hear that
[51:19] evangelists continue on the field
[51:23] in this hour of course what they mean
[51:25] certainly
[51:26] by all means don't change the thing
[51:29] if jesus is coming in the morning preach
[51:31] today like if it will be tenure or some
[51:33] day but live like it's going to be at
[51:35] this hour
[51:37] don't don't get scrupled up now that's
[51:39] what i'm trying to warn you about see
[51:42] just don't be odd peculiar don't change
[51:44] nothing but if you're doing something
[51:45] wrong
[51:46] or doing evil repent come back to god
[51:50] continue on your evangelistic service
[51:52] just as you always did
[51:54] if you're building a house put it on up
[51:56] jesus comes tomorrow
[51:57] you'll be found faithful of the duty
[51:59] you're building your church go on put it
[52:00] up
[52:01] i'd rather be put my money in something
[52:03] like that be found within my pocket see
[52:05] that so just just keep on continue as
[52:07] you are everybody understand now
[52:09] continue right on just go right on as
[52:12] you are
[52:13] now this uh amen
[52:17] just don't stop don't do nothing just go
[52:19] right on just as you are keep on serving
[52:21] the lord
[52:22] now for instance if you was if you was
[52:24] working for a man
[52:26] and you know what it was 15 minutes
[52:27] before quitting time
[52:29] well you'd say huh just 15 minutes more

[52:47] out say well nobody eat them i'll make a
[52:49] difference dig them out anyhow

[52:53] letter from somebody of these somebody
[52:55] told them said
[52:56] well the time's at hand sell the farm
[52:59] now you won't need the food that you
[53:00] live off of on farms that cost

[53:24] today
[53:24] amen sir he made me a farmer i'm going
[53:27] to stay right at my duty
[53:29] that's right if he made me a mechanic
[53:31] say who's
[53:32] somebody um said the other day he said
[53:35] a fellow come in and said say um brother
[53:38] you know what

[53:41] set of keys i bought a new car
[53:43] he said i'm going to give you the second
[53:44] set of keys i told his pastor
[53:47] so i'm going to give you the second set
[53:48] of keys because the rapture might come
[53:51] you know
[53:52] and said i won't be needed anymore
[53:58] [Music]
[54:04] pastor's gonna miss it
[54:13] let's make it ready isn't it all right
[54:16] well that's
[54:17] that's the way it is see we mustn't be
[54:18] that way we must be a
[54:20] a sane solid christian
[54:24] but i'm put here to work right up to the
[54:26] last minute
[54:28] i've got a job to do and i'll be right
[54:30] bound faithful to foster duty if he
[54:31] comes this morning
[54:32] i will be standing right here in the
[54:33] pulpit you say brother i'm if he has
[54:35] come this morning shouldn't you be out
[54:36] there no sir this is my post of duty
[54:38] amen i'll be standing right here
[54:39] preaching when he comes saying the same
[54:41] things i am there when he comes i'll
[54:42] just move right on out with him
[54:44] if i'm holding potatoes i'll just be
[54:46] horn away just as hard as i can when he
[54:48] comes i'll just drop the hole and take
[54:49] off
[54:50] remember in the jubilee year if they
[54:52] just
[54:53] horn with the hole they kept on holding
[54:55] they know the jubilee years maybe
[54:57] 10 minutes more and the trumpet will
[54:59] sound at the jubilee year
[55:00] they just kept on pitching hey whatever
[55:02] they're doing but when the trumpet
[55:04] sounded then they dropped the fish fart
[55:05] and gone
[55:06] that's it just keep on pitching hey
[55:08] until the trumpet sound
[55:10] all right question according to the
[55:13] opening
[55:14] that that would be
[55:17] say he puts it pretty straight out
[55:20] we'll work till jesus comes
[55:23] i thought about that as as i was i had
[55:26] just
[55:26] read that the last couple weeks and this
[55:30] and
[55:31] what about that thief on the cross
[55:35] at the last moment he hears this day
[55:38] you'll be with me in paradise
[55:42] the 11th hour worker gets the same
[55:44] reward as that first
[55:45] hour worker would we be so
[55:49] how should i say so selfish so
[55:52] hard-hearted that
[55:53] we would say lord they came in at the
[55:55] last minute and i worked for 50 years
[55:59] the reward is the same that's right the
[56:01] reward is the same
[56:04] but if our hearts are right we would
[56:06] want everyone
[56:07] to come in sure and it's it's sometimes
[56:11] and i've known that as a minister and
[56:15] it's
[56:16] it's hard to believe now it's 33 years
[56:18] that we've been coming here
[56:21] um my children were young i sat in the
[56:25] back there we were
[56:27] raising our daughters and i have a
[56:30] little
[56:30] compassion on the young families
[56:34] they get one to finally sit down in
[56:36] church and the next one you're training
[56:39] and then the next one you're training
[56:40] and it's i remember brother jerry
[56:44] mcfadden brother al peterson asked
[56:46] myself and brother jerry to start
[56:47] helping out
[56:50] and ushering and just greeting the folks
[56:52] at the door
[56:53] and after about six months brother jerry
[56:55] asked brother al if he could go sit down
[56:57] with sister amy and help raise the
[56:59] children
[57:00] peter and sharon and eddie and i don't
[57:03] think
[57:04] your youngest sis laura was born yet at
[57:06] that time
[57:08] and brother hal says sure brother jerry
[57:10] you can go do that
[57:12] so i thought surely he'll let me go i
[57:14] got more than brother jerry does
[57:16] and brother al says no brother aaron you
[57:18] stay back here
[57:20] i need you here and
[57:24] i wondered about that and i was talking
[57:26] to brother jerry one day and i said
[57:27] brother jerry i took your place you were
[57:29] here before me
[57:30] and and all and brother jerry
[57:33] looked at me said brother aaron last
[57:34] night i had a dream
[57:36] i was talking to brother branham and i
[57:39] asked him about doing some work and he
[57:40] turned around and said brother jerry you
[57:42] don't speak spanish
[57:44] and that was about the time all these
[57:46] folks began to arrive and we would have
[57:47] the uh
[57:48] balcony full of a spanish-speaking speak
[57:52] student and i would take them up there
[57:54] but i didn't know that but brother al
[57:56] says no you need to stay here
[57:59] god has a reason for all these things
[58:01] standing here looking back that way it's
[58:04] easier to understand but standing here
[58:06] looking that way he was saying
[58:08] i don't know why but there's a reason
[58:11] for all these things that god has done i
[58:13] look at brother
[58:14] brother jordan and brother peter now as
[58:16] young men who have become part of the
[58:19] the body here and and being a part of it
[58:22] in in
[58:22] in now they're my age or a little older
[58:25] than when i got here
[58:27] and we never thought we'd see that day
[58:30] but we're still here
[58:32] and even so come quickly lord jesus
[58:36] but we may have 10 more years so let's
[58:39] keep our shoulder to the wheel and let's
[58:40] keep working
[58:42] so i would like to just bring
[58:45] bring some scriptures here and let's
[58:48] look at the two sides a little bit
[58:50] and we just read psalms 19 9 just to
[58:54] remind you god is in charge
[58:57] he has it all under control nothing is
[58:59] amiss
[59:01] although sometimes it might question why
[59:04] and why
[59:06] but we'll understand it all by and by
[59:09] and sometimes i think do i really need
[59:12] to understand it
[59:14] it's god's word therefore believe it
[59:17] take him out and let him bring it to
[59:18] pass so hebrews 12
[59:22] verses 1 and 2 chapter 12.
[59:27] and we'll start it this way wherefore
[59:31] seeing that we are
[59:33] are also compassed about with so great a
[59:37] cloud of witnesses
[59:40] many that have gone on before us and if
[59:43] i could say even some that are still
[59:45] living but have gone through this
[59:47] already
[59:49] and could tell us hold on
[59:52] don't give up now i have been where
[59:55] you've been
[59:56] i thought it was the end of it it wasn't
[59:58] going to work but here we are today
[1:00:01] yet he says we have a great cloud of
[1:00:03] witnesses
[1:00:04] just speaking of chapter 11 as paul had
[1:00:07] named it one after another
[1:00:10] of abel and of moses and he's going down
[1:00:13] this great cloud of witnesses
[1:00:14] we have he said let us lay aside
[1:00:18] every weight that which causes us to
[1:00:23] to to slow us down to to drag us he's
[1:00:26] let us lay it aside he says
[1:00:28] and the sin sin is unbelief
[1:00:33] brother brahma says sin is unbelief
[1:00:36] we take and apply sin to everything else
[1:00:40] and he said no it's unbelief therefore
[1:00:42] because you don't believe
[1:00:44] then the other things happen and
[1:00:46] sometimes that's hard in our
[1:00:47] understanding he says
[1:00:49] which doth so easily beset us and let us
[1:00:52] run
[1:00:53] with patience the race that is set
[1:00:55] before us
[1:00:59] he says here therefore since we
[1:01:04] have so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:01:06] surrounding us
[1:01:09] let us lie lay aside everything that
[1:01:11] encumbers us
[1:01:14] sometimes you have to take the heavy
[1:01:15] coat and take that off
[1:01:18] sometimes you have to take the work
[1:01:19] boots off
[1:01:21] and put little light a lighter pair of
[1:01:23] shoes to run on
[1:01:26] some of the greatest runners ran
[1:01:27] barefoot you ever seen some of those
[1:01:30] from the from african contents they run
[1:01:32] barefoot they never had shoes and
[1:01:33] they're great runners
[1:01:35] yet sometimes we put everything on to
[1:01:37] try to run the race
[1:01:39] but he said let us lay aside those
[1:01:41] things that we think we need
[1:01:43] to wear in order to get there now i'm
[1:01:46] not preaching to disrobe yourself
[1:01:48] no not at all but the things that you
[1:01:51] need
[1:01:52] that you think i got to have this to
[1:01:53] accomplish this
[1:01:55] god has placed in you everything you
[1:01:57] have need of
[1:01:59] laying aside those things he says and
[1:02:02] let us run
[1:02:03] with endurance
[1:02:06] i've got a goal set before me i know
[1:02:09] it's
[1:02:10] if you're doing a marathon 26 miles of
[1:02:13] running
[1:02:14] you don't burn yourself out at a hard
[1:02:16] run over the first two miles
[1:02:19] there's a pace that is set to be able to
[1:02:22] endure
[1:02:24] all 26 miles and let us run with
[1:02:27] endurance the race that is set before
[1:02:29] and verse 2 looking unto jesus the
[1:02:32] author and finisher of our faith
[1:02:36] not only does he start it he finishes it
[1:02:39] the author
[1:02:40] the one that wrote it described it put
[1:02:42] it in the book
[1:02:43] and the finisher of our faith
[1:02:47] who for the joy that was set before him
[1:02:51] endured the cross
[1:02:55] my brother my sister run this race
[1:02:58] endure this race
[1:02:59] for the joy that is set before you
[1:03:04] because sometimes and i ran cross
[1:03:07] country
[1:03:10] and um it it was
[1:03:13] you always had well let me let me
[1:03:15] rephrase that i always had somebody
[1:03:17] ahead of me because i never finished
[1:03:18] first
[1:03:20] there was always runners ahead of me and
[1:03:21] sometimes i'd have to key on one and try
[1:03:23] to pace myself with that one
[1:03:26] because they were running a little a
[1:03:27] little faster pace than i was
[1:03:30] um one time i did manage to start out
[1:03:32] way out in the very
[1:03:33] front for the first couple hundred yards
[1:03:36] and also and i start hearing folks the
[1:03:39] the the
[1:03:40] some of my co-runners and come on aaron
[1:03:42] keep it up keep it up but it didn't take
[1:03:44] long when i found myself in the middle
[1:03:45] of the pack and then pretty soon towards
[1:03:47] the back of the pack
[1:03:49] but you know what you still set your
[1:03:50] eyes on the one that's ahead of you
[1:03:53] and you begin to run and i remember
[1:03:54] being towards the back of one of the
[1:03:56] very first runs i did and there was
[1:03:58] another guy walking
[1:04:00] and i caught up to him and he says come
[1:04:03] on just walk with me
[1:04:05] i don't want to be alone while the rest
[1:04:08] of them were already way down the
[1:04:10] the track and i said no at least
[1:04:14] jog i i'm going to jog at least i'm not
[1:04:18] going to walk i may not catch those guys
[1:04:20] but i don't want to walk in the back
[1:04:22] either
[1:04:23] i want to give an effort i want to
[1:04:24] endure as best i can he says
[1:04:27] but for the joy that was set before him
[1:04:30] he
[1:04:30] endured all the way until he said
[1:04:34] it is finished
[1:04:37] so there's a thing for us to do as
[1:04:40] christians
[1:04:41] as brothers and sisters to endure to
[1:04:44] encourage
[1:04:46] to get in a pace of running where we can
[1:04:49] help one another it's not
[1:04:50] to the one that finishes first in this
[1:04:52] race
[1:04:54] this is not one where just one gets the
[1:04:57] prize this is one where you run your
[1:04:59] race
[1:04:59] to get the prize but we ought to
[1:05:03] encourage one another
[1:05:05] it says he despised the shame and he sat
[1:05:08] down at the right hand
[1:05:10] of the throne of god and then
[1:05:13] philippians 1
[1:05:14] 6 tells us being confident
[1:05:17] of this very thing that he which hath
[1:05:21] begun
[1:05:22] a good work in you will perform it until
[1:05:25] the day
[1:05:26] of jesus christ and who
[1:05:29] started the good work in you was it
[1:05:31] brother green
[1:05:33] was it yourself are you able to
[1:05:36] accomplish it yourself no
[1:05:38] we need one another we're all part of
[1:05:40] the body of christ
[1:05:41] but persuade yourself come to that
[1:05:43] understanding encourage yourself that he
[1:05:45] started the work therefore
[1:05:47] he'll finish the work in me being
[1:05:50] persuaded
[1:05:52] the grounds of which persuasion are set
[1:05:54] down in the following verse that he who
[1:05:56] hath begun a good work in you
[1:05:58] will perfect it until the day of christ
[1:06:01] that
[1:06:01] he who having justified have begun to
[1:06:05] sanctify you
[1:06:06] will carry you on this work
[1:06:09] till it issue in glory he began it
[1:06:13] he'll finish it he's not one oh you know
[1:06:16] what
[1:06:16] i gotta plan change we're gonna go a
[1:06:18] different way
[1:06:20] we've done that enough times on a trip
[1:06:22] you see a
[1:06:23] another road hey let's go find out where
[1:06:26] that road goes
[1:06:27] let's go the long way let's see me and
[1:06:29] my wife and the last time we were up in
[1:06:31] the mountains
[1:06:32] we decided just to take any dirt road we
[1:06:35] saw
[1:06:36] while we were cruising up up there by
[1:06:38] big lake and all that
[1:06:39] let's see where this goes five hours
[1:06:42] later
[1:06:43] we saw a lot of places we had never seen
[1:06:46] before
[1:06:48] and then it's i'm tired let's go find
[1:06:51] something to eat
[1:06:52] let's go find something to rest at it
[1:06:54] was no more
[1:06:56] all over the mountain it was getting on
[1:06:58] a road and let's get back to the cabin
[1:07:01] we're hungry and tired but he realizes
[1:07:04] he says
[1:07:05] you you're you're being persuaded you
[1:07:08] know that
[1:07:09] this is a race set your eyes on the goal
[1:07:12] and go pursue that
[1:07:17] and then hebrews 13 and this is the the
[1:07:20] scripture that started this
[1:07:22] hebrews chapter 13
[1:07:26] and verse 14
[1:07:29] for here we have no continuing city
[1:07:33] but we seek one to come this world is
[1:07:36] not my home
[1:07:38] i'm just a passing through you know
[1:07:41] and when you've gone on a trip and
[1:07:42] you've gone and you've passed through it
[1:07:44] especially if you've been down that road
[1:07:46] so many times
[1:07:48] we we used to go camping a lot in
[1:07:51] california dad loved to take us out
[1:07:54] we did quite a bit all the way up into
[1:07:56] canada
[1:07:57] all over the west states on the west
[1:08:00] side and
[1:08:01] of the united states and all but one of
[1:08:04] the most
[1:08:05] places we went to was a high sierras on
[1:08:07] the east side of the house here's kind
[1:08:08] of
[1:08:09] would be on the east side the backside
[1:08:10] of the mountains from yosemite
[1:08:12] a lot of streams and lakes and it was
[1:08:14] the same road
[1:08:16] we would take off through the devour cut
[1:08:18] off hit 395
[1:08:20] drive about eight to ten hours and get
[1:08:22] to the mountains
[1:08:26] and there was an a w we would stop at
[1:08:29] hey kids remember these things
[1:08:32] to get a soda and ice cream and there
[1:08:35] was a little museum
[1:08:37] that we would stop at quite often it's
[1:08:39] the first time i've ever actually seen
[1:08:40] gold a gold nugget
[1:08:43] you could actually see it there but
[1:08:46] after 10 times
[1:08:48] on that same trip for an eight-year-old
[1:08:51] nine-year-old 10 year old 12 year old
[1:08:54] nothing changed in that museum it was
[1:08:57] still but dad liked to stop every time
[1:09:00] and later on as as me and my brothers
[1:09:02] got older he remembered the museum
[1:09:04] you remember how dad stopped every time
[1:09:05] and nothing ever changed
[1:09:08] but dad liked to go see it
[1:09:11] you know so we got off we walked we saw
[1:09:13] it we got in the truck and can you
[1:09:14] our our vision our thing was getting to
[1:09:17] the campground
[1:09:19] that's all we thought of dad enjoyed the
[1:09:22] trip
[1:09:23] all the way up there he was the driver
[1:09:24] too
[1:09:26] then when we got there we jumped out of
[1:09:29] the truck
[1:09:30] and took off running as hard as we could
[1:09:32] towards the river or the lake whichever
[1:09:34] one we camped at
[1:09:35] and then we would hear it get back here
[1:09:37] boys we still got to unload
[1:09:41] and that's the part we tried to get away
[1:09:42] from every time and dad never let us
[1:09:46] till we got a little older we realized
[1:09:48] that was part of the job
[1:09:50] you know there are things at times that
[1:09:52] get in front of us and we don't want to
[1:09:53] deal with it
[1:09:56] it only took at most an hour to get
[1:09:59] everything unloaded
[1:10:00] get the camp set up and then we had the
[1:10:02] rest of the week
[1:10:03] to enjoy but we thought if we missed
[1:10:06] that one hour how much we were going to
[1:10:08] miss
[1:10:09] sometimes you have a reason to stop
[1:10:13] and lend a helping hand and encourage
[1:10:16] somebody
[1:10:17] and pray for somebody and do something
[1:10:20] good for somebody
[1:10:21] on your journey on your trip
[1:10:25] wherever it is that you're going with
[1:10:27] the hope and the the heart
[1:10:28] to get there but not so
[1:10:32] focused on getting there that you miss
[1:10:35] somebody on the side of the road
[1:10:36] that you could help that you could
[1:10:40] encourage
[1:10:41] knowing that this is not our home this
[1:10:44] is not where we're building our empire
[1:10:47] because we're looking for a city that is
[1:10:48] to come
[1:10:50] the same one that abraham said there's
[1:10:52] that one
[1:10:53] we're looking for that same one
[1:10:58] he said we have no permanent city
[1:11:01] but our longing for that city which is
[1:11:03] soon to be ours
[1:11:07] soon brother and it's been 30 years for
[1:11:09] me it's been 50 years for me it's been
[1:11:12] compared to eternity that's nothing
[1:11:15] sometimes you just have to be reminded
[1:11:20] verse 15 tells us by him therefore let
[1:11:22] us offer the sacrifice
[1:11:24] of praise to god continually
[1:11:27] that is the fruit of our lips giving
[1:11:29] thanks to his name
[1:11:32] in this journey in this trip in this
[1:11:34] effort however you want to
[1:11:35] put it continue to magnify continue to
[1:11:38] worship him continue to be thankful
[1:11:40] continuing to be grateful he says
[1:11:45] and then he tells us
[1:11:48] but to do good and to communicate forget
[1:11:52] not
[1:11:54] or he said for with such sacrifices
[1:11:58] god is well pleased
[1:12:01] and then just another way as i was
[1:12:03] looking at some of the other
[1:12:04] translations but go on doing good and
[1:12:07] giving to
[1:12:08] others because god is well pleased with
[1:12:11] such
[1:12:12] offerings let's not get so focused in
[1:12:15] our journey again
[1:12:17] that we leave everybody standing on the
[1:12:18] side of the road that needs help
[1:12:20] god is well pleased he's walking
[1:12:24] along the seashore of galilee and
[1:12:27] and as as the service started and
[1:12:29] brother matt was leading the song
[1:12:30] surface and i just i knelt to pray back
[1:12:32] there
[1:12:33] and just in my heart i began to say lord
[1:12:35] you had time
[1:12:37] to stop and minister to others
[1:12:40] even though your your heart and
[1:12:42] everything was set
[1:12:44] for calvary but you called your own
[1:12:47] disciples and said come on over the side
[1:12:49] of the shore and you made them some fish
[1:12:51] you cook them some fish
[1:12:53] for them tea you stopped you would stop
[1:12:56] there with lazarus and martha and mary
[1:12:58] and have some fellowship with them
[1:13:02] he went to the woman at the well
[1:13:06] knowing if anybody saw him with her
[1:13:10] they'd have a whole different idea of
[1:13:11] why he was there
[1:13:13] but he knew why but if you will came
[1:13:17] around the corner
[1:13:18] and you saw brother aaron on the corner
[1:13:19] and there's a lady working that street
[1:13:21] corner
[1:13:22] i pray god all of you would say brother
[1:13:24] aaron is being a missionary a missionary
[1:13:27] to that sister and not thinking
[1:13:28] the other way around but we're human and
[1:13:31] you know what goes to somebody's mind
[1:13:33] immediately
[1:13:35] but he had time to stop and minister
[1:13:39] on his journey to calvary
[1:13:47] he says in hebrews
[1:13:50] 10 34.
[1:13:56] he said for you had compassion of me in
[1:13:58] my bonds and took this is paul speaking
[1:14:01] and took joyfully the spoiling
[1:14:03] of your goods knowing in yourselves that
[1:14:06] you have a
[1:14:07] heaven in heaven a better and enduring
[1:14:12] substance
[1:14:15] the losses made necessary
[1:14:18] by becoming christians
[1:14:22] knowing in yourselves that you have in
[1:14:25] heaven
[1:14:25] a better and enduring substance
[1:14:28] knowing that if they are lost on earth
[1:14:32] they would gain in heaven
[1:14:35] i don't have time right now to stop
[1:14:38] because i could lose this
[1:14:41] this world's not my home i'm not
[1:14:43] amassing my fortune and my building and
[1:14:46] all
[1:14:46] here but i shouldn't be so preoccupied
[1:14:50] at
[1:14:50] being the first to get to heaven that i
[1:14:52] don't have time
[1:14:53] to lend to helping him this is what paul
[1:14:55] said to them
[1:14:57] he says you had compassion of me in my
[1:15:00] bonds
[1:15:01] and took joyfully the spoiling of your
[1:15:03] in other words you gave
[1:15:05] of what you had to help someone else
[1:15:08] but i only have one left
[1:15:11] give and you shall receive abundantly
[1:15:15] but be careful that you don't give to
[1:15:18] receive abundant faith
[1:15:20] lord i'm going to give these two and
[1:15:22] knowing you're going to make 10 out of
[1:15:23] them
[1:15:24] because i really want the 10. oh that's
[1:15:27] not where the blessing is
[1:15:30] all that i am and ever hope to be i owe
[1:15:33] it all to him
[1:15:38] so we're looking at that right now as we
[1:15:41] have no enduring sitting here
[1:15:43] we're not looking to make this our home
[1:15:46] now
[1:15:47] do i say well then just go live in a mud
[1:15:50] hut
[1:15:51] go go just live in a tent don't worry
[1:15:53] but i said no
[1:15:54] brother ram says no if you're a farmer
[1:15:55] farm plant
[1:15:57] if you're a house builder build your
[1:15:59] house go on
[1:16:02] some of you young people are going
[1:16:03] through college nobody wants half a
[1:16:05] doctor
[1:16:07] nobody wants somebody who had a year or
[1:16:10] two
[1:16:10] as a pharmacist but then quit because
[1:16:12] i'm not going to that one
[1:16:14] to get my prescription filled i want one
[1:16:17] who's graduated i want one who endured i
[1:16:19] want one who has a good reputation
[1:16:22] i want one that can read the doctor's
[1:16:24] writing
[1:16:26] i say that all the time i when i do a
[1:16:30] job
[1:16:31] and the homeowner has to sign you give
[1:16:33] them the ipad and they sign
[1:16:35] and some of them do their best and it's
[1:16:38] we don't we don't
[1:16:39] provide a stylist to do with your finger
[1:16:42] and i'm sure that's because the company
[1:16:44] knows we'd lose all the stylists and
[1:16:45] they'd be replaced
[1:16:46] buying them all the time so they use
[1:16:48] their finger and some of them try to do
[1:16:50] the most perfect
[1:16:51] signature but most of us just go like
[1:16:54] that
[1:16:56] so when they do something like that oh i
[1:16:57] see you're a doctor
[1:16:59] or i say i'm glad you're are you a
[1:17:01] pharmacist by a chance i go why because
[1:17:03] that's you have to read those kind of
[1:17:04] writings
[1:17:05] and they all kind of laugh and i say i
[1:17:06] wonder why
[1:17:08] how a pharmacist reads a doctor's
[1:17:10] writing manages to get
[1:17:12] the right prescription i told them
[1:17:16] one one of them i said i think the
[1:17:17] pharmacist goes to school for eight
[1:17:19] years
[1:17:20] seven and a half to learn to read the
[1:17:22] writing and the other six months is just
[1:17:23] to understand medicine
[1:17:25] and they just kind of laugh but you know
[1:17:27] what we want somebody who has gone
[1:17:30] through
[1:17:31] somebody who has has learned by
[1:17:34] experience
[1:17:35] we want somebody whose life
[1:17:38] shows that they are dedicated to what
[1:17:41] they're doing
[1:17:43] a reputation that follows them
[1:17:48] so again no enduring city
[1:17:51] we're not building this because i plan
[1:17:54] to
[1:17:54] live here eternally no but while i'm
[1:17:58] here
[1:17:59] let me be faithful let me be honest
[1:18:02] let me work till jesus comes
[1:18:05] it is i know the the
[1:18:09] the scripture tells us beware when all
[1:18:11] men speak good of you
[1:18:14] but i think there's a balance to that
[1:18:16] too you should have a good reputation
[1:18:19] you should be a christian you should be
[1:18:21] honest about things
[1:18:23] we should have that known about us
[1:18:26] my my the man that was my boss the
[1:18:29] the longest he was my boss for almost 20
[1:18:31] years
[1:18:32] he told me one day he says you've got to
[1:18:34] be the slowest worker i've ever had
[1:18:37] but when the day is done you get all
[1:18:38] your work done and it's right he goes so
[1:18:40] that's good enough
[1:18:43] i worked with a couple of guys that oh
[1:18:45] they just never stopped
[1:18:47] and when the day was done neither was
[1:18:48] their work
[1:18:50] because all they did was move around the
[1:18:52] whole time
[1:18:54] but a good reputation they come to work
[1:18:57] they they they give a full day of effort
[1:19:01] they're they're good people to be around
[1:19:04] you know and and those are the kind of
[1:19:07] people that you
[1:19:08] that you want to hire that you want to
[1:19:09] be around you know
[1:19:11] he said so you want that
[1:19:14] but this world is not your home trying
[1:19:17] to keep the balance of those two things
[1:19:20] looking at your checkbook sometimes or
[1:19:23] your savings account or
[1:19:26] your 401k and you look at it and say my
[1:19:28] goodness
[1:19:29] i really need to push this hard and
[1:19:31] again i'm not saying don't do that
[1:19:34] i've seen those that went the other
[1:19:36] direction
[1:19:37] and jesus didn't come in 77
[1:19:40] and their whole life fell apart they
[1:19:43] lost their hope
[1:19:45] you know what does he live like he's
[1:19:47] coming today
[1:19:49] a plan like he's not coming for a
[1:19:51] thousand more years there's a balance to
[1:19:53] live there
[1:19:55] on hebrews 13
[1:19:59] 5-6
[1:20:03] let your conversation be without
[1:20:05] covetousness
[1:20:06] and be content with such things as ye
[1:20:09] have for you
[1:20:10] for he hath said i will never leave thee
[1:20:13] nor forsake thee
[1:20:16] so that conversation
[1:20:20] is not really speaking of the word you
[1:20:22] speak the things you talk
[1:20:24] it's the life you live when you look at
[1:20:27] the word conversation in the scriptures
[1:20:29] most of the time it's speaking of your
[1:20:31] lifestyle
[1:20:32] although at times it is speaking of the
[1:20:34] conversation the words jesus
[1:20:38] so another way to say make sure that
[1:20:40] your character
[1:20:41] is free from the love of money
[1:20:46] i wonder why paul goes at this
[1:20:49] quite often in the scriptures
[1:20:52] about the love of the things of the
[1:20:54] world and you really can't love the
[1:20:56] things of the world participate without
[1:20:57] money
[1:20:59] because very little is free out there
[1:21:02] you know so he says when your drive when
[1:21:05] you're
[1:21:05] you everything that you're doing is push
[1:21:08] to make money therefore to accomplish
[1:21:10] this he said
[1:21:11] what is that speaking of your character
[1:21:14] well brother aaron if i had millions i'd
[1:21:17] give
[1:21:17] millions away
[1:21:22] can you give the one you have away right
[1:21:24] now
[1:21:26] i'm talking to myself because i
[1:21:27] struggled with this for a long time too
[1:21:30] lord i only have five dollars in my
[1:21:32] wallet i can't help
[1:21:33] nobody i find out quickly that if i give
[1:21:37] those five
[1:21:38] those five multiply quickly
[1:21:41] i also found out that i can't give it
[1:21:42] away so it will multiply
[1:21:44] i have to do it with the right attitude
[1:21:46] in the right heart
[1:21:48] that's what paul is saying here he says
[1:21:52] that your character
[1:21:55] is free from the love of money
[1:21:58] being content with that which you have
[1:22:01] for he himself said i will never desert
[1:22:03] you
[1:22:04] nor will i ever forsake you
[1:22:08] the same god that was there
[1:22:11] on the side of the hill and says we've
[1:22:13] got to feed
[1:22:15] these people and peter
[1:22:19] and the disciples who should have known
[1:22:22] better
[1:22:23] you could say he turned the water into
[1:22:26] wine
[1:22:30] he'd done enough things in front of them
[1:22:32] that they should have said
[1:22:34] what did mary say go ask him
[1:22:38] i've watched him i've seen him i've seen
[1:22:40] what he does
[1:22:41] go ask him he knows how to take care of
[1:22:43] this
[1:22:47] the disciples said lord how are we going
[1:22:49] to feed there's so many of them and he
[1:22:51] goes what do you have
[1:22:54] well there's three fishes and five
[1:22:56] loaves and jesus goes well it's
[1:22:58] more than enough wow this
[1:23:02] i gotta see it was
[1:23:05] more than enough
[1:23:08] he says
[1:23:13] for the lord is my helper so that we may
[1:23:16] boldly confidently without fear
[1:23:20] say the lord is my helper
[1:23:24] and i will not fear what man shall do
[1:23:26] unto me
[1:23:29] well aaron it's happened a few times
[1:23:31] i've gotten laid off
[1:23:34] work got slow got laid off
[1:23:38] god never failed because there's
[1:23:42] layoffs happening because there's work
[1:23:43] short god
[1:23:45] never fails if he can take two
[1:23:48] fishes and fi five levels of bread or
[1:23:50] three loaves of bread whatever
[1:23:51] and feed twelve thousand is he not the
[1:23:53] same yesterday today and forever
[1:23:59] and then paul tells us in philippians 4
[1:24:02] 9
[1:24:06] those things which ye have both learned
[1:24:08] and received
[1:24:09] and heard and seen in me
[1:24:12] do and the god of peace
[1:24:15] shall be with you
[1:24:20] why could paul say that because paul had
[1:24:23] experienced it paul a man
[1:24:26] who who looked at his own genealogy look
[1:24:29] where his his
[1:24:30] lineage was and said if you want to
[1:24:32] compare
[1:24:33] uh uh what's the word
[1:24:38] who is who is fit for this who has more
[1:24:41] reason
[1:24:42] to justify himself or stand on his own
[1:24:45] merits
[1:24:46] listen to mine and he gives them
[1:24:50] and they're flawless
[1:24:54] but he says i had to count that as
[1:24:58] nothing because if
[1:25:01] paul had had said i'm that first church
[1:25:03] age messenger
[1:25:04] and therefore i understand the
[1:25:06] scriptures therefore i will be able to
[1:25:09] lay it all out for you
[1:25:13] the same thing that brother branham said
[1:25:15] at the seventh age messenger
[1:25:17] if that angel had not come into the room
[1:25:19] with me
[1:25:20] when he's going to minister the seven
[1:25:22] seals he said what a mess
[1:25:24] i would have made because it's not of
[1:25:28] ourselves
[1:25:29] paul was the first sage of messenger to
[1:25:31] recognize it's not of me
[1:25:33] learn of thee he said and the god of
[1:25:36] peace because he understood where he
[1:25:38] came he'll be with you too
[1:25:41] so we're not left alone you're not in
[1:25:43] this by yourself
[1:25:44] we're part of family of god we're a body
[1:25:46] joined together
[1:25:49] but the eye can't be the finger and the
[1:25:50] finger can't be the eye
[1:25:53] in fact most of the time the finger is
[1:25:55] poking the eye if you're not careful
[1:25:58] i've never had my eye chase my finger
[1:26:00] down to bite it or anything but my
[1:26:01] finger has poked my eye quite a few
[1:26:03] times
[1:26:04] but it's part of the body and it has
[1:26:08] its place i've never been able to grab
[1:26:11] the glass of water with my eye and drink
[1:26:13] out of it
[1:26:14] but i can take my hand and use my
[1:26:15] fingers and bring it to my mouth and
[1:26:17] drink
[1:26:17] it's part of the body every part
[1:26:21] you'll remember some of those things
[1:26:24] it's part of the body
[1:26:25] we need one another but paul says
[1:26:29] those that you have learned and received
[1:26:32] and heard
[1:26:33] and seen in me
[1:26:36] there is a visible testimony
[1:26:39] that a christian gifts not in words
[1:26:44] but in actions brother greene taught us
[1:26:47] something
[1:26:49] i always remember it so when god speaks
[1:26:52] to you
[1:26:53] and you remember he would say don't say
[1:26:54] a little bird he told me
[1:26:56] it blew in in the wind he said
[1:26:58] understand that's a god working in your
[1:27:00] life
[1:27:01] don't get credit to a little birdie he
[1:27:03] would say yeah
[1:27:05] you know what that was i was building up
[1:27:06] your faith
[1:27:08] to understand that god deals with you
[1:27:10] too that he's mindful of you he knows
[1:27:12] you by name
[1:27:14] he's and he would say you see god tells
[1:27:16] you to do something you don't do it and
[1:27:18] you get in trouble for it
[1:27:20] and you question was it really god and
[1:27:23] then he tells you again
[1:27:25] and you question it and you don't do it
[1:27:26] you get in trouble for it
[1:27:28] kind of like mom and daddy would do when
[1:27:30] we were young children
[1:27:32] learning and then he said
[1:27:35] about the third or fourth time you began
[1:27:37] to pay attention and say
[1:27:39] god said it i'm gonna go do it because i
[1:27:41] know what happens
[1:27:42] if i don't i'm beginning to learn a
[1:27:45] lesson
[1:27:47] and that's how we learn lessons by doing
[1:27:50] them and doing it
[1:27:52] sometimes you can get less and right the
[1:27:54] first time sometimes you don't
[1:27:56] it's all part of the character building
[1:27:59] so paul reminds us
[1:28:01] and brothers and sisters there are those
[1:28:04] that are
[1:28:05] new in christ there are those that are
[1:28:08] young
[1:28:09] and they're looking at you
[1:28:12] you who have served god for a long time
[1:28:15] and they're watching
[1:28:17] so that to see if it's the same as with
[1:28:19] you as it was with paul
[1:28:20] those things which you have seen both
[1:28:23] learned
[1:28:23] and received and heard and and seen in
[1:28:26] me
[1:28:27] do do also the older sisters ought to
[1:28:31] teach the youngers
[1:28:32] you older brothers ought to be men in
[1:28:34] front of the young
[1:28:36] because you've learned by experience we
[1:28:38] have to continue the same way
[1:28:41] philippians chapter 1 verse 27
[1:28:45] again paul tells us only let your
[1:28:48] conversation be as it becometh
[1:28:51] the gospel of christ
[1:28:55] he says
[1:28:59] i i i look at that and you say it
[1:29:02] becometh the gospel of christ
[1:29:06] that whether i come and see you or else
[1:29:09] be absent
[1:29:10] i may hear of your affairs that you
[1:29:13] stand fast in one spirit with one mind
[1:29:17] striving together for the faith of the
[1:29:19] gospel
[1:29:23] not a church that's split not a body
[1:29:25] that's broken up this one pulling that
[1:29:26] way this one going that way
[1:29:28] but a body that's united a people that
[1:29:30] are encouraging one another that are
[1:29:32] strengthening one another
[1:29:33] let it be heard of that let it be seen
[1:29:35] of that he said
[1:29:36] let that which is manifested
[1:29:40] in how you act and live let it be seen
[1:29:43] that way
[1:29:46] or only conduct yourselves in a matter
[1:29:48] manner
[1:29:49] worthy of the gospel of christ
[1:29:52] simple way to understand then in
[1:29:55] philippians
[1:29:56] we'll go through philippians here
[1:29:58] chapter 3.
[1:30:01] you know sometimes in reading the
[1:30:03] messages
[1:30:05] studying the messages and brother
[1:30:07] branham and then getting into the
[1:30:09] scriptures especially in the new
[1:30:11] testament
[1:30:12] realizing how much paul wrote how much
[1:30:15] time he had to deal with
[1:30:17] dealing with the church's congregations
[1:30:21] we would have loved if brother branham
[1:30:24] could have just come and not had to deal
[1:30:25] with all this other and just
[1:30:27] get into the depth of the word and the
[1:30:29] message like everybody says
[1:30:31] brother it's in the depth of the message
[1:30:33] but he said you are yet children
[1:30:38] i i had this
[1:30:41] this habit i don't know if that's the
[1:30:44] right word but
[1:30:45] i did it to my daughters when they're
[1:30:47] little and i've done it to my
[1:30:48] granddaughter
[1:30:50] and it's mean but i seem to like it
[1:30:54] so i do it they start counting one
[1:30:57] two three and i start going no no it
[1:30:58] goes five three seven six
[1:31:01] till mama would get mad she would say
[1:31:02] stop it you're going to confuse them
[1:31:05] and i thought it was funny but then i
[1:31:07] realized it's not that funny because i
[1:31:09] am confusing them
[1:31:12] but you see as children we have to learn
[1:31:15] i hear chloe and asher now they're
[1:31:18] mama's teaching them to count teaching
[1:31:20] them their colors and she'll send us a
[1:31:22] snap of them counting and their colors
[1:31:24] and all and we're excited to say wow
[1:31:26] look at
[1:31:26] she can count all the way to 20 now but
[1:31:29] it took somebody to teach them and work
[1:31:31] with them
[1:31:33] we just don't sit down and it all comes
[1:31:37] there's a conversation a life to be
[1:31:39] lived so that others coming in
[1:31:41] can learn can receive paul said it that
[1:31:45] way
[1:31:45] those things that you have learned of me
[1:31:48] so he says here
[1:31:51] paul says this and watch what paul says
[1:31:53] here starting with verse seven but what
[1:31:55] things
[1:31:56] were gained to me those i counted
[1:31:59] lost for christ now we know paul because
[1:32:02] he had just been talking about his
[1:32:04] lineage about his heritage about his
[1:32:07] qualifications
[1:32:08] he said if you want to count it that way
[1:32:11] i am more qualified than you are
[1:32:15] i have more phds i have more degrees
[1:32:19] i have more schooling than you have
[1:32:22] if you want to count it that way he says
[1:32:27] yea doubtless i count all things
[1:32:30] but loss for the excellency of the
[1:32:34] of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord
[1:32:39] i think about paul on as a first age
[1:32:43] messenger
[1:32:45] and the things that god brought through
[1:32:47] him the scriptures and all
[1:32:49] the foundation of christianity
[1:32:53] and and it was allowed to be written so
[1:32:55] that we could have it
[1:32:57] and here's a man who battles his
[1:32:59] education
[1:33:02] he has to say i count it for loss i
[1:33:04] can't depend on it
[1:33:06] i i can't that's not my foundation
[1:33:10] in fact i trot on it i count it as dung
[1:33:15] that which was walked over on the road
[1:33:18] and you have a seventh age messenger
[1:33:20] brother branham who comes to restore us
[1:33:23] back
[1:33:24] to what the first stage messenger
[1:33:25] brought and he struggles because
[1:33:28] he did not have education
[1:33:31] all that i could have and you hear him
[1:33:33] you hear him he's walking through
[1:33:35] oral roberts university and he says this
[1:33:38] of himself
[1:33:39] the splendor and the beauty of it all
[1:33:41] and he says
[1:33:42] obviously lord you couldn't trust me to
[1:33:45] handle all of this
[1:33:46] i wouldn't be able to do it
[1:33:49] and he says many times oh that i could
[1:33:51] have had some education i could
[1:33:53] do this i could have in his mind it was
[1:33:56] a struggle
[1:33:59] and then when he steps out of that
[1:34:02] university
[1:34:03] those buildings god did not speak to him
[1:34:05] while he was in there
[1:34:06] but when he got out of the influence of
[1:34:08] that then that voice said
[1:34:11] but i am your portion
[1:34:15] if we're not careful we get caught up in
[1:34:18] all that's around us
[1:34:20] and we're not hearing god is saying i am
[1:34:22] more than that
[1:34:24] i am more than that and that's what paul
[1:34:27] is saying here
[1:34:28] i realize that i have to count that i
[1:34:30] have to lay this
[1:34:31] for the knowledge the excellency of
[1:34:33] getting to know
[1:34:34] him personally
[1:34:41] he says well yea doubtless and i count
[1:34:43] all things but lost
[1:34:44] for the excellency of the knowledge of
[1:34:46] christ jesus my lord
[1:34:48] for whom i have suffered the loss of all
[1:34:51] things
[1:34:52] and do count them but dung that i may
[1:34:55] win christ the loss of all things
[1:35:00] everything that he deemed that he had
[1:35:02] worked for he said i've lost it all
[1:35:05] for the excellency of getting to know
[1:35:07] him
[1:35:11] then he says and be found in him
[1:35:14] not having my own righteousness which is
[1:35:17] of the law
[1:35:18] the works the do's and don'ts performing
[1:35:21] this
[1:35:22] taking care of that making sure that i
[1:35:24] pray for three hours every morning
[1:35:26] that i read a message every day that i
[1:35:28] and if we're not careful it becomes
[1:35:30] allah rather than a desire
[1:35:34] see when you desire to do something it's
[1:35:36] easier to do it
[1:35:38] when it becomes a law it becomes a work
[1:35:42] and we talk about this in relationships
[1:35:45] all the time
[1:35:47] you know and um a relationship
[1:35:51] is work it just doesn't happen in its
[1:35:54] own
[1:35:55] but there's joy in a good relationship
[1:35:58] there's desire
[1:35:59] it it's um we were talking the other day
[1:36:02] because
[1:36:02] sarah has gotten in into making some of
[1:36:05] her own
[1:36:06] arrangements with flowers just something
[1:36:07] she does to keep herself occupied
[1:36:10] and one day i was coming home and i
[1:36:11] don't really remember
[1:36:13] what what the occasion was and i stopped
[1:36:16] at a
[1:36:17] at the grocery store to pick up
[1:36:19] something and i saw the display of
[1:36:21] flowers and i don't remember if it was
[1:36:23] mother's day or what it was and
[1:36:27] and i went to the lady and i'm looking
[1:36:28] there and it's been displayed and i
[1:36:30] couldn't find something i lied and she
[1:36:31] goes well can i make you something
[1:36:33] i said yeah that would be nice and so
[1:36:35] she goes what would you like and i said
[1:36:37] put some of these and put some of these
[1:36:38] and
[1:36:39] and i i arranged it i don't know how it
[1:36:41] happened but i did
[1:36:42] you know got it all arranged and she put
[1:36:45] it in
[1:36:46] and i walked from there to the cash
[1:36:48] register and i kept getting stopped
[1:36:50] where did you get that it's so beautiful
[1:36:53] and and they i said well the lady
[1:36:55] actually made it for me
[1:36:57] and walking out to the vehicle again i
[1:37:00] was getting stopped that's such a
[1:37:01] beautiful arrangement
[1:37:03] i think but here was an amazing part i
[1:37:05] get home with it and
[1:37:06] there was a flower for each one my wife
[1:37:09] and each one of the girls
[1:37:12] and i didn't know this but each flower
[1:37:15] is in there was a favorite
[1:37:17] of each one of them
[1:37:20] now i knew that and i arranged it no i
[1:37:22] didn't
[1:37:24] god knows how to do that part
[1:37:28] you make you yield yourself you say lord
[1:37:30] use me
[1:37:31] and watch him go to work
[1:37:35] but they all were saying and they
[1:37:36] remember we're talking about it sarah
[1:37:38] she goes i remember that you came home
[1:37:39] and it was beautiful and each one of our
[1:37:41] flowers were in there
[1:37:44] um half the time i forgot to get flowers
[1:37:46] from my wife on our anniversary
[1:37:49] it was just one of those things that god
[1:37:50] showed me he's in charge
[1:37:54] he made a bouquet of flowers for me one
[1:37:56] time
[1:37:58] you say oh brother aaron how could that
[1:37:59] be well i know what it did for me
[1:38:02] sitting in my company vehicle at lunch
[1:38:04] parked on the side of the road
[1:38:06] and a little whirlwind come down the
[1:38:08] street and the
[1:38:10] palo verde trees have all the little
[1:38:12] flowers and had just fallen
[1:38:14] it picked it up and was coming down the
[1:38:17] street
[1:38:18] in a bouquet like that in that shape and
[1:38:20] it went around my truck
[1:38:22] and then it went down and i said he's
[1:38:24] mindful of me
[1:38:26] you could see it any way you want to but
[1:38:29] i said he's mindful of me
[1:38:31] he just went by and said he loves me
[1:38:34] that's how i saw it and another time
[1:38:37] sitting at the
[1:38:38] at the at the kitchen table was home by
[1:38:42] myself and i just spoke these words out
[1:38:45] loud i said lord is everything okay
[1:38:47] between me and you
[1:38:50] and i heard a rushing sound i looked out
[1:38:52] the
[1:38:53] west window with a kitchen window
[1:38:54] looking out west and
[1:38:56] that tree is not moving at all but
[1:38:59] suddenly my front door
[1:39:00] or the kitchen door opens which i didn't
[1:39:02] have it all the way closed it opens
[1:39:04] and there's a little whirlwind right
[1:39:06] there and it stops at my door
[1:39:08] and it just spins for a while and then
[1:39:10] it goes out and continues but it didn't
[1:39:12] touch anywhere else
[1:39:14] now i saw that i know it happened you
[1:39:16] don't have to believe it
[1:39:17] but he came by to tell me it's okay
[1:39:21] see he knows how to do those things
[1:39:24] we just have to make ourselves available
[1:39:26] to him
[1:39:27] use me lord however it is
[1:39:30] on my journey home paul says i found
[1:39:33] in him not having my own righteousness
[1:39:36] which is of the law
[1:39:37] which is of my works but by the
[1:39:40] faith of christ the righteousness
[1:39:45] which is of god by faith that i may know
[1:39:48] him
[1:39:49] and the power of his resurrection and
[1:39:51] the fellowship of his sufferings
[1:39:53] being made conformable unto his death
[1:39:57] being willing to say not me lord you
[1:40:01] not my will but thy will be done
[1:40:04] that if by any means i might attain
[1:40:08] unto the resurrection of the dead
[1:40:10] because i know i cannot raise myself
[1:40:14] i know i cannot live eternally without
[1:40:16] the eternal one in me
[1:40:18] paul's saying all that i have done
[1:40:21] doesn't guarantee
[1:40:22] me a resurrection but this
[1:40:26] him he does
[1:40:30] and then he says this not as though i
[1:40:33] have already attained
[1:40:34] either were already perfect complete
[1:40:38] whole mature but i follow
[1:40:41] after that i may apprehend that for
[1:40:44] which i am also
[1:40:45] apprehended of christ that i can go
[1:40:48] after that the way he came after me and
[1:40:51] took a hold of me
[1:40:54] because that's what paul says that i may
[1:40:56] go after and apprehend that the way he
[1:40:58] came and apprehended me
[1:41:00] he came down and knocked me off my high
[1:41:01] horse put me on the floor
[1:41:06] until i could recognize who he was
[1:41:12] and then he says and not that or
[1:41:15] another way they're not that i have
[1:41:16] already obtained the prize or i'm
[1:41:18] already perfected
[1:41:20] but i pursue that i may also get
[1:41:23] possession of it
[1:41:24] seeing that also i have been taken
[1:41:26] possession of by christ
[1:41:28] jesus it's christ in me he says the hope
[1:41:31] of glory
[1:41:33] he says brethren i count not myself to
[1:41:36] have apprehended
[1:41:37] but this one thing i do forgetting those
[1:41:40] things which are behind
[1:41:41] and reaching forth unto those things
[1:41:43] which are before
[1:41:46] i look back sometimes and say i don't
[1:41:47] want to go back that way
[1:41:49] i made a mess out of it looking past
[1:41:52] that
[1:41:52] uh maybe some of those steps were were
[1:41:55] good steps
[1:41:56] but sometimes they weren't but i'm still
[1:41:58] i'm not going to judge myself by that
[1:42:00] and live in that i'm going to go forward
[1:42:03] i'm going to continue to press towards
[1:42:05] the mark of the high calling
[1:42:08] verse 14 i press towards the mark of the
[1:42:11] prize of the high calling
[1:42:13] of god in christ jesus let us there for
[1:42:16] as many as be
[1:42:18] perfect well
[1:42:22] most of you said well that's not me
[1:42:25] the perfect one lives in you
[1:42:28] and he sees you through the blood and
[1:42:31] you're his righteousness
[1:42:33] you're as righteous as he is righteous
[1:42:34] because it's his righteousness in you
[1:42:37] you have to be careful sometimes what
[1:42:40] you say about yourself
[1:42:42] and i understand that's why i was trying
[1:42:43] to show you with show you with paul
[1:42:45] and brother branham him battling his
[1:42:49] education
[1:42:50] and brother brandon battling the lack of
[1:42:51] education
[1:42:53] but in in all both of them yielded
[1:42:55] completely to christ
[1:42:56] and let christ do the work the same is
[1:42:59] for me and you
[1:43:02] there's things that brother lyle can do
[1:43:04] that
[1:43:05] i can't touch
[1:43:08] you know he shared some of the things
[1:43:10] that that he did and and what
[1:43:12] what what is his work field on i i
[1:43:14] wouldn't even know where to start
[1:43:18] but i'm trying to think of something
[1:43:21] that maybe he can't do that i could do
[1:43:23] that's kind of hard but no i know
[1:43:26] let's get a brother up here and speak in
[1:43:27] spanish and let's have brother lie
[1:43:28] interpret for him
[1:43:30] brother lyle wouldn't even come up okay
[1:43:34] but god has ordained you to do
[1:43:38] i dare sister holly to come and play the
[1:43:40] piano
[1:43:42] she's not even going to try to get up
[1:43:44] but if i ask sister lily to come she'll
[1:43:45] come up and play the piano watch because
[1:43:46] that's what sister lady does
[1:43:49] each one of us has a part to play
[1:43:52] each one of us has something god has
[1:43:54] placed us to do
[1:43:56] and therefore i can do all things
[1:43:58] through christ who strengthens me
[1:44:01] because it's him and you then he says
[1:44:02] that he says
[1:44:09] let us therefore as many as be perfect
[1:44:11] be thus minded
[1:44:12] and then he says and if anything he
[1:44:14] otherwise be otherwise
[1:44:16] god will reveal this unto you
[1:44:19] if you have some questions you're
[1:44:20] wondering god will reveal it unto you
[1:44:23] this is the way my child this is the way
[1:44:25] to go brother brahm had a lot of
[1:44:26] questions
[1:44:28] one day he's walking through greens mill
[1:44:30] 14 mile creek
[1:44:31] where the cave was and jehovah god
[1:44:35] jehovah of the old testament is jesus
[1:44:37] christ of the new
[1:44:39] and brother brown said the whole bible
[1:44:41] becomes a whole new bible when
[1:44:42] god begins to show it to you it changes
[1:44:45] the whole view
[1:44:49] and another way paul says is then let us
[1:44:51] all have become to full growth
[1:44:53] be of this mind and if anything
[1:44:56] you are of if anything you are of a
[1:44:58] different mind
[1:45:00] even this will god make clear to you
[1:45:02] paul knew
[1:45:04] that he was writing the word of god
[1:45:09] and that's why he had to stand and his
[1:45:10] brother branham says if any man teach
[1:45:13] anything different paul says it let him
[1:45:15] be a curse brother ramstein says
[1:45:17] this is the word of god
[1:45:20] he says stand on it he couldn't be any
[1:45:23] different than that first stage
[1:45:24] messenger
[1:45:25] neither with every messenger in between
[1:45:27] what god gave him they stood on every
[1:45:29] bit of it
[1:45:32] he said nevertheless where to we have
[1:45:34] already attained
[1:45:35] let us walk by the same rule let us mind
[1:45:38] the same thing
[1:45:40] or another way let's not lose any ground
[1:45:43] let's not go backward let's go forward
[1:45:46] he says for our conversation
[1:45:50] is in heaven from whence we also
[1:45:54] look for the savior the lord jesus
[1:45:56] christ
[1:45:57] or another word for this is our
[1:45:59] citizenship
[1:46:02] is in heaven from whereas we also wait
[1:46:05] for a savior the lord jesus christ
[1:46:08] and i looked up the word citizenship the
[1:46:10] state of being vested with
[1:46:12] the rights privileges and the duties of
[1:46:15] a citizen
[1:46:17] now who vested that in you
[1:46:20] was it brother green at tucson
[1:46:21] tabernacle was it brother branham for
[1:46:24] this message
[1:46:24] was it paul knows christ
[1:46:28] he says been vested in you as a citizen
[1:46:31] of this country and then he says it this
[1:46:34] way
[1:46:35] who will change or shall change our vile
[1:46:38] body
[1:46:39] that it may be fashioned like unto his
[1:46:41] glorious body
[1:46:42] according to the working whereby he is
[1:46:45] able even to
[1:46:46] subdue all things unto himself and
[1:46:50] this one line who shall fashion a new
[1:46:53] the body
[1:46:54] of our humiliation
[1:46:57] how much how often this guy embarrasses
[1:47:01] this guy often
[1:47:05] oh there you go again haven't you
[1:47:07] learned anything
[1:47:09] when are you going to grow up oh lord
[1:47:12] how
[1:47:13] long i'm glad you're patient with me
[1:47:16] lord but i've done it again
[1:47:20] paul says there's a change coming in the
[1:47:23] meantime
[1:47:24] let us press towards the mark of the
[1:47:27] high calling
[1:47:28] let us work with our all give it our all
[1:47:32] but in my giving now all let me have
[1:47:35] some time to reach my arm over my
[1:47:37] brother
[1:47:38] take my brother by the hand
[1:47:41] encourage my sister say come on
[1:47:44] let's go forward till we get there
[1:47:49] it's christ in us the hope of glory
[1:47:55] let me say it again it's christ in us
[1:47:58] the hope of glory
[1:48:00] without it there is no hope of glory the
[1:48:03] musicians would come
[1:48:06] lord i have no continuing city here
[1:48:10] my aim my heart is looking forward to
[1:48:13] that city whose builder and maker is god
[1:48:17] oh that city where the lamb is the light
[1:48:19] all those things
[1:48:21] but i've got a journey yet to complete i
[1:48:23] have some more steps to take
[1:48:26] and let me put my shoulder to the wheel
[1:48:29] let me continue
[1:48:30] as brother branham said if you're a
[1:48:31] farmer keep farming
[1:48:33] whatever you're affiliated keep working
[1:48:35] on as a christian
[1:48:36] till that day beulah land
[1:48:40] i'm longing for you
[1:48:41] [Music]
[1:48:43] let's bow our heads for the lord
[1:48:48] our hearts desire i believe everyone
[1:48:51] here
[1:48:52] maybe there's some immediate things that
[1:48:54] we would say well i need to get this
[1:48:56] done
[1:48:58] i've got to finish this but really down
[1:49:00] deep our hearts desires
[1:49:02] is to leave this life behind and to go
[1:49:05] with me
[1:49:06] be with you for eternity lord
[1:49:09] but you told us today lord there's work
[1:49:11] still to do
[1:49:12] until that day let us be of that mindset
[1:49:16] and press towards the mark of the high
[1:49:18] calling
[1:49:18] [Music]
[1:49:20] to encourage one another to be faithful
[1:49:24] in the position the place you've
[1:49:26] you've put us to be or because that that
[1:49:30] one part that doesn't get
[1:49:32] done could cause the failure
[1:49:36] of the whole process we've seen it
[1:49:39] happen many times
[1:49:42] that last little bolt didn't get
[1:49:44] tightened all the way it was missing a
[1:49:46] washer or a seal
[1:49:50] the lug nuts didn't get tightened all
[1:49:52] the way and the tire fell off and there
[1:49:54] was an accident in it lord
[1:49:56] let us make sure the lord we do that
[1:49:57] which we're called to do
[1:50:00] as we seek and if we go forward wanting
[1:50:03] to go home we ask
[1:50:04] jesus christ i'm kind of
