as much as Cloverdale has and spreading this gospel around the world and and getting the message out and um it's been done sincerely so brother we are honored that you all and sister that you all would come and that you would sing in our church with all that the history and all of the good things that have come from Cloverdale to this time and there's many more things coming I believe with brother brother Tom is the pastor now believe with brother Tom May May the Legacy continue and may you continue to win souls I always appreciated Cloverdale because they they have a burden for lost souls and they they're all they do a lot of witnessing and they they do a lot of work there and that's that's something that I highly highly respect um brother John Reynolds I don't know you brother John is that you welcome brother John is your first time here oh where you from Phoenix Phoenix well welcome God bless you it's good to have now we can clap it's good to have you in service is Teddy here Teddy's a homeless guy kicked him out this morning and I felt bad I said come to service brother Teddy is the one he's a he's a good he's he's actually he's a friend of mine um he's the one that uh we sent out a prayer request um that he was stabbed in front of the church and I was talking with him this morning he he um composed this rap song about about the Lord Jesus and and you know he he did it for me this morning and and uh said brother thank you thank you but he loves the Lord and uh he um he was actually he felt like he was defending our our dear brother Arie Peterson um brother Arie is just so he's so sweet he's so humble but he said that there some of the folks were talking back to him and insulting him and and he he didn't appreciate it and let me tell you he was fighting for the right side so God God bless him he might he might come in here in a little bit he comes in um fairly often I appreciated and and any other visitors if I've missed you I see that we were missing some that uh maybe maybe U they got sick I know that wow when I got up to camp last week it just descended on me like a ton of bricks and and uh feel like I'm over it now but I'm uh still kind of weak from from this past so there's there's probably some missing today let's always remember each other in prayer I was I was uh when we first got there um the evening we had on the schedule to go out and have quiet time quiet time as we started doing that at stillwaters camp but I've done it my I've really done it my whole life and um it's something that is probably the most important thing in my life is that time to get just get quiet before the Lord and I want to encourage the congregation to do that so and it is on the camp schedule to have this quiet time so we went out and I was was scheduled to be I think 5:00 and and I sat down in my chair and I saw all of you all many of you going out to your place and I looked at the people going out and finding their tree that they were going to sit under or um place that they were going to sit and I I thought Lord what this is this is a big deal the these are souls these are your children and I thought there's nothing greater that I could do than to encourage each of you to get quiet before the Lord read your Bible to to pray to hear his voice and it's so easy in the world today it's so easy with with all all of our wasted time and all the distractions that we have it's so easy to fall out of love with Jesus but if you get into this book brothers and sister if you just dig into this this precious book right here and you start reading this it is so easy to fall out of love with the world and fall back in love with the Lord Jesus it is it is there is nothing greater that we can do than to just sit down and read these wonderful wonderful words that are the words of Life the The Book of John starts it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God this word is God and then that same word came down and made was made flesh and dwelt among us if you don't get anything from this service today I challenge you to take your time and dig into this book every single day you you young people you have tests and you study for that test you go to the textbook you open it up and you read about what's going to be on the test we have a test every day and if we are not reading this test textbook and constantly in it brothers and sisters we are going to fail the test so stay in this book take an hour a day an hour yeah we can spare an hour of our precious time to dig into this Bible and read it and absorb it and if you don't understand what you're reading get another translation we have people brother you speak French you have a French Bible it was translated Louis agon is that the Bible that you use it's translated from the same original texts as our Bible is but it's different but it says the same thing if you can't understand this Bible don't put yourself punish yourself and and try to make yourself understand something you can't get another translation get another good translation and read that there's nothing in the message me or in the word or anything that says you can't I was telling uh told marily my mother-in-law before she wonders how I know my Bible so well and it wasn't because I went to Bible school I read these little kids Bibles to my kids and I learned story after Story every single day we'd spend at least 30 minutes usually an hour hour reading our little kids' Bibles and teaching my children about those things and I there's certain things I might not agree with in there I just leave that part out but it helped me to understand and brothers and sisters I've I've fallen in love with this book at a very very young age and I love it more now than I have ever loved it's everything to me please take time get into it and if you're reading down it doesn't matter how long you take if you're reading down in something doesn't make sense stop write there don't go on to the next verse stop right there maybe look at another translation or look in the context and maybe even pray about it Lord I don't understand this and the Lord will give you the understanding but don't just read over it just to get done this book is meant to be understood excuse me not just meant to be read as I said it's it really is this is the word this is God speaking to his people God speaking to us and if we are going to say that we're Christians if we are going to say that we're Believers if we're going to say these things then we need to dig into this word and put our efforts into it and not just sit back and say well I'm I'm good everything's fine and not having gone through the efforts of studying it as I said you kids in school you study for a test all of us everyone in this room without exception every single person there's tests every day this is your text book this is how you pass the test get to know this book I can't over I can't overstated I was a friend of mine he's a pastor in South Africa he sent me uh a video that I I listen to it and then I listen to it again and I thought you know this is this is really really good and it's a what's called a Christian apologist just he's a he's a theologian and he's just the brothers got a really nice spirit and I thought you know this this old man really put things in perspective and I thought this would be good to share with the congregation it's about five minutes long so brother Jordan if you could put it up there and we'll listen to it we'll watch it Dr Lennox has been foremost known for his work in the field of apologetics and debates against famous atheists like late Christopher Hitchens Richard Dawkins and others he is undoubtedly one of the most well-loved Christian apologists of our time in the year 2019 Dr lnox was asked on what would be his final words of wisdom to his children not only to my children but anybody our lives Rush past we've become fixated on digital equipment that's robbing us of time people say to me they've no time they've loads of time if you want to know how much time you've got just ask yourself a simple question how how much time have I spent in the last week fiddling with a piece of digital equipment and doing things that of no relevance whatsoever to my profession or my life and then say have I got any time we're robbing ourselves of the most important thing in life if we're Christians and that is seeking fellowship with God through his word you will never make any impact on This World by reading the Bible for 5 minutes before you jump into bed and I'm brutally practical you you husbands will never make any impact on the world if you're not praying with your wives and leading your families spiritually you just won't it's not possible to develop a deep relationship within a family that is not triangular that is it doesn't include Jesus Christ at one corner and we can seek to repent of these things and really begin to make time so that in that sense we get to know God I used to think that sence and all of these arguments were much more interesting than the Bible and I discussed it with my mentor David Gooding and he said would you like to do a Bible study and he invited me to do one one night transformed my life completely in Cambridge where I for the very first time I met a person that took scripture seriously and he entered a dialogue with Matthew and it was just mindblowing how he began to open the treasures of scripture but it takes input and work many of you people are professional think of the work you had to do to get to where you are now if God has giving you that kind of mind how much of it are you using on him and what worries me silly is people who rise in their professional career like that but their knowledge of scripture remains on a basic baby Sunday school level so the moment their peers raise any questions they instantly detect they've not thought it through and that silences them often forever forever sadly so it's it's a Clarion call and I think it is a way of pushing against this tide of mediocrity where we don't take God's word seriously so what that tells me when I find it in my own heart is I don't really love God all this talk about going to heaven and going to meet with Christ if that happened to you now what would you say to him what would you talk about it is very serious stuff CS Lewis says all the leaves of the New Testament russle with expectation of Eternity and have we've never sensed that the word of God is given to us to make Eternal things real and we need to spend time immersed in it perfectly reading it with other people and alone I had a very close friend at Cambridge years ago we agreed that whoever died first the other remaining person would preach at the funeral he thought I would die first because I was quite a bit older but I never forget the day when he called me and with tears in his eyes he said I got a tumor as big as a grapefruit in here and that's going to be it you'll have to take my funeral I said to him what shall I say without hesitation he said this he said tell them to do what we did as students in Cambridge to pour over the word of God prayerfully and wait on God until his face appears amen and then they will have something to say do you want something to say you Pastor teacher Sunday school if you want something to say there is no shortcut and I'll never forget those essentially last words to the world and I've repeated them many times that was what transformed me it wasn't reading all the philosophy in the world although I love it and find it interesting and it's a way of Building Bridges and dealing with difficulties but in the end unless God is real through his word we're we're missing the central Fellowship that he offers us so thank you very much and God bless you all Dr Lennox underscores the importance of pouring our time in the scriptures prayerfully studying and understanding them in order to become an effective witness for Christ in our own domain of vocation only when we take the word of God seriously can we have something to say to the world thanks for watching God bless you is that not the truth just a simple understanding get into the word amen we waste so much time that's true brothers and sisters and this time one thing that all of us have is time we may not have money we may have money we may have uh this or that but and not have this or that but one thing we all have is we all have time remember brother Israel PO said one time I really appreciated it he said why don't we tithe 10% of our time I thought that's a good thing to think about we tithe 10% of our money let me ask you what would God want more from you on your time or your money with my son my daughter what would I want more from them I would want their time I would want their love so often we have we have too much to do we're too busy and we say Lord I'll get to you when I have time just not right now and the humility of God and the sweetness of God he backs off and he takes whatever we give him that's every one of us why can't we give him more he got he gave us a little bit on he gave us something that that gave us eternal life he gave his life on the cross his blood Spilled Out on the ground for me can't I give him a little bit more time can't I give him a little bit more of my love and can't I spend more time in this textbook understanding God more when we look into this book we are looking into the face of God this is him from the beginning to the end if you want to know God know this book there's a when I watched that um I fell into the trap a little bit and uh I started watching a couple other videos which I believe it was it was the Lord and I got to this man his name is Jeff Durban he I think he's he's got a church up in Phoenix and uh he runs the organization called apologia Studios and his main efforts are to he his Outreach to the local Mormons I believe in Mesa Arizona and also as an anti-abortion activist and the brother he gets into these discussions and I have never seen um a gift like him where he can just quote scripture after scripture after scripture and scriptures that are very um present that are very that that are for the conversation so he was so I I got step and um and we were watching this one video of him and he's talking to these this sweet old Mormon couple and uh they were on the street right outside the Mormon Temple and and he starts up this conversation and and I don't really um I I appreciate his gift and and I appreciate what he's doing I don't really agree with him because he seems like he's just against everything rather than really for something but it's just his gift it's his calling and what he does and and he he Stokes up an argument so what he did is there's these um two Mormon two sweet Mormon couple and they're walking by and he starts in this conversation and he starts saying that that here this Bible verse shows that the Mormon um ideology is wrong it's directly against what the Bible says that I am I am God and I change not one of their tant is God changes and then I am and then I am God I'm one and they say no there's many gods there's Gods all over this is just our God and and then he quotes he says I am God there was none before me and there will be none after me and showing that the Mormon religion is completely wrong in the foundation and and the the Mormon guy kept saying he kept saying well no that's just how how you believe we don't believe that and he says here it is it's the word and he says well how do you know the word's translated right and he says it is and he showed that it that it was and and the the whole convers ation this this Mormon man his his whole Foundation was well God revealed it to me that this is true God revealed it to me that this is true no matter what this says I've had an experience with God so God revealed to me that this religion is right that everything is true in this but it if it doesn't match this brothers and sisters our experience is false no matter how real it seems they kept on and on and going back and forth and then the Mormon man says he says well he says you and I he says we can quote scriptures all day and it's not going to do any good and he said this he said you haven't quoted one scripture to me and and I thought that's right amen the one brother went back to the Bible said this is our absolute this is what's real and this over here I don't care about your experience it has to match this word we've learned that you've listen to it hopefully enough tapes that you can understand that this is the absolute right here and if doesn't match this word then it is not right no matter what your experience is no matter how powerful it was no matter how you came to the Altar and and some miracle that's not it this is the this is the final this is the absolute and when you're faced with a scripture that contradicts how you believe or quote with how you believe or whatever and you respond if you're faced with a scripture that that contradicts how you you believe and you respond that you just don't understand that scripture what you're really saying is that you don't believe that scripture because it doesn't line up with your religion and how many in our circles are guilty of doing that well I just I just don't understand that part no you're saying you don't believe it it doesn't match your religion therefore as the Mormon man my religion is more important than this book no this book is more important than my religion and there's some things that this book is very plain most many things as I said this is the textbook and we we we're given a test every day we must know this word in Acts chapter 17 Paul and Silas brothers that's that's why we're doing our WI Wednesday night bible studies that's why we've gone through the book of Acts that's why we're doing this is I want us to understand I want you to be able to go into the book of Hosea like brother Lyle preached on Wednesday night and I know what it's about now there was a there was a quote in there that said that God will tear us down so he can build us back up and sometimes brother Ed that's how it happens he'll tear us down and we'll get so low and then when he builds us back up we are built up stronger that mortar is set those bricks are even everything is good and before there's cracks in the foundation of everything and we get built up now I've been through it I am a stronger man now than I was then but I had to go through those trials first Paul and Silas were they were out and they were preaching the gospel Paul we know he had to get torn down ripped apart and the religion taken out of him so that God could rebuild that they're out preaching and they're on the road in Acts chapter 17 let's read this blessed word now when they had passed through a amphipolis in abalonia they came to thessalonica where was a synagogue of the Jews and Paul as his manner was went in unto them and three Sabbath days reason with them out of the scriptures stop there for a moment Paul reasoned with the Jews on the scriptures do you think Paul just suddenly had knowledge of the scriptures no he spent hours and days and years years studying the book that's how he could reason that's how he could present it is because he had spent the time he was highly educated he was under one of the greatest professors the Jewish professors that had ever lived on the law of Moses and the prophets G gel and second after after he had had his experience he went into another country for 3 years to study the Bible to make sure that his experience matched this book no matter how powerful Paul's experience was knocked down off his horse smoke blind the Lord Jesus talks to him he comes in gets healed gets baptized still Lord I want to make sure that my Revelation that my experience matches this book spent three years The Scholar that Paul was spent three years studying the book to make sure that his experience no matter how powerful it was matched the Bible read verse one again now when they had passed through amphipolis and abalonia they came to thessalonica where there was a synagogue of the Jews and Paul is his manner was went in unto them and three Sabbath days reason with them out of the scriptures open opening and alleging that Christ must needs have suffered and risen again from the dead and that this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ and some of them believed and consorted with Paul and Silas and of devout Greeks and a great multitude and of the chief women not a few it shows that the sisters need to read their Bibles too it's not just your husband we are equal in this sisters you got to read it but the Jews which believe not moved with envy and took unto them a certain LW fellow certain lwd fellows of the baser sort and gathered a company and set all the city on an uproar and assaulted the house of Jason and sought to bring them out to the people and when they found them not they drew Jason and a certain Brethren unto the rulers of the city crying that these have turned the world upside down and are come hither also people are so often offended at the truth because it doesn't match their way of thinking book of Acts is full of this story right here and they think that and then they are they're just as zealous in their beliefs as we are they are just as firm in what they think as we are and they're zealous enough these ones are to want to kill these men they hated Paul and Sil because they disagreed and and quoted scriptures that did not match what they thought whom Jason hath received and all these do contrary to the decrees of Caesar saying that there is another king one Jesus and they troubled the people and the rulers of the city and when they heard these things and when they had taken taken security of Jason and of the other one they let them go and the Brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas By Night unto Berea Who coming tother went into the synagogue of the Jews I love that look at the boldness of Paul and Silas they just about got killed over here they let him out by night they go right back to another city and start doing the same thing these brothers were filled with the Holy Spirit and these brothers were firm in what they believed they had had an experience and they could back it up with the scriptures the bereans these were more noble than those in thessalonica in that they received the word with all Readiness of mind they didn't just cut it off and say this doesn't match my religion I don't want to hear it like the Mormon did in the video they received it with ready Readiness of mind and they searched the Scriptures Daily whether these things were were so they were secure they were confident in the scriptures and their understanding of the scriptures they were so confident that they could go right into the Bible and not be afraid that they were going to be wrong but seeking what was right and they received this word with Readiness of mind and they searched those scriptures every day to see if these things that the Apostle Paul was saying is true they weren't searching the scriptures to prove Paul and Silas wrong and they weren't searching the scriptures to prove Paul and saw this right how many of us always look at myself when we have a conversation how many of us if somebody presents something to us how many of us immediately are trying to think of scriptures to prove them wrong or if somebody in our church and we're talking to each other how many of us are trying to find scriptures to prove them right but instead we should be back like these bereans were and say Lord what is right let me dig into your word let me dig into this and let me see is this that I'm hearing is it right or is it wrong they probably had an idea in their mind what the Messiah would be probably a great king great General but when Paul and M brought them the Bible and showed them the prophecies maybe prophecies out of Isaiah a virgin s conceive or in Genesis or even less known scriptures like in Hosea out of Egypt I've called my son and say this pertains to this man or or Micah that he would be born in Bethlehem and he was we don't know exactly we know that they they brought these things out through the scriptures and these bereans took what they said and they brought it to task in the Bible and they studied it and basically they fact checked them we thought we see fact check oh you're not supposed to fact check during a debate well they waited and they fact checked with the Bible now we know Paul we know that after his experience he didn't agree with the conventional way of thinking he didn't he he the the conventional legalism of the Jews and to the point that he didn't he said that there is a point in all this there is a meaning in all that you're doing and this meaning everything comes back to Christ and these bereans they didn't have a a judgmental attitude either they were just trying they they weren't trying to defend their rhetoric in church they approach the word with a Readiness of M and they search the Scriptures Daily as I said and and they they listen listen to these things that Paul and Silas said they took them in and they maybe even Paul quoted that Jesus said to the the priests of the day he said that you search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life and they are they that bear witness to me he's saying that the scriptures if you would truly know them that's what bears witness to Christ and now twice in the same chapter it wasn't just the brothers the sisters were part of this also therefore many of them believed also of The Honorable women which were Greeks and of men not a few so why did the bereans believe and where did pil Paul and Silas why were they so able to preach the gospel you go back to the video that we just saw and what this man was saying they spent the time they studied they they they they prayed and they didn't waste time on the things of the world they had everything ready let's turn to Ephesians chapter 5 verse 6 it says this the same Apostle speaking here the Apostle Paul let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of Disobedience be not ye therefore partakers with them for ye were sometimes Darkness but now ye are light in the Lord walk as children of light imagine how a son or daughter walks through this world do you think that these CH these children of light are spending their time on unproductive things gossip continually posting on social media constantly keeping your mind occupied on something other than the word remember the brother saying at the beginning he said count how much time you spend on a device going through meaningless things and then count how much time you spend on the word all of us let's do that think about how much time we spend in meaningless things and how much time we spend on on the words of eternal life so walk as children of the light and how do we do that for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and Truth proving what is acceptable unto the Lord how can you prove what is acceptable it's a simple statement how do you prove the same verse the NIV says this and find out what pleases God it's another translation that same thing you must be studying the word and that is how you prove right from wrong and good Doctrine from Bad Doctrine it's not holding the party line or repeating a religious rhetoric that doesn't work that's been going on throughout history and it's been it goes on today and it doesn't work it is through studying the word about and praying about these things that you don't understand and that's how you find out what is acceptable to God Hosea 46 I think it's Hosea it says my people perish through lack of knowledge let's go back to um 511 and we and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret but all things that are are reproved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever doth make manifest is light wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise and here's my subject in the title and I'm I'm just now getting to the title Redeeming the time because the days are evil saying making the make the most of your time is putting the Lord's first praying and reading your Bible first thing in the in the morning then being productive during the day we might have it on our Minds that the only way to serve God is to constantly read my Bible all the time and pray no we have to go through this life but whatever we're doing do it right put your heart into it if you're going to work do a good job at work if you're studying study if you're if you're in school study and do well on your tests everything should be the best that you do I believe brother brandom said that if you're going to be a bum don't work a day in your life be the best that you can I don't recommend that but he's he's he's proving a point dick Tomy was a football coach from the University of Arizona um in the in the 90s and he used to tell his team my brother would U my brother was on the team and and he would tell me that coach Tomy would always tell his his people his players wherever you are be there if you're at football practice give it 100% if you're in school give it 100% I'm going to add this if you're at church be there don't be thinking about something else don't be thinking about getting out and where you going to go to lunch and all this or how long brother Dan's going to be up there today you know it's always the same but be here and listen to what I'm saying and then as I'm saying it you're taking it in and then you are checking it with your knowledge of the scriptures and you need to have knowledge of the scriptures you need to be able to go back like the bereans and say is this right is what the brother was saying in church whether it be me or visiting minister or something that you hear is this according to this word wherefore be ye not not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is how do you understand he repeats himself how do you understand what the will of the Lord is the way almost everyone does it they learn nowadays they just learn from their parents and the parents learn from the parents' parents and then when you want to come to the Lord that's the place that you go you could grow up Catholic it's like okay I got to start getting right so I got to go to the Catholic Church I got to talk to the priest if you grow up among our circles then you do it a certain way but the right way is to get into is Lord seek seek God and and this right here has sanctioned by God himself seek God and study his word and that is how you come to God that is what will give you a last fting a firm foundation on these things verse number 17 wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is one thing we can receive our healing we can receive our Salvation we can we receive after we we pray and we receive the answer to our prayers but one thing brothers and sisters that you won't receive that requires work is your knowledge of the Scriptures it doesn't just pop into your mind God has an ordained path whether it be a prophet or whether it be any of us we must spend that time in the scriptures if we are to know the Scriptures it takes something from us salvation is an unmar gift knowledge comes from from study it comes from work I'm going to read the Amplified version of verses 15 through 17 Ephesians 5 just leave the King James up there therefore see that when you walk carefully living life with honor purpose and courage shunning those who tolerate and enable evil not as unwise but as wise sensible intelligent Discerning people making the most of your time on Earth recognizing and taking advantage of each opportunity and using it with wisdom and diligence because the days are filled with evil with evil therefore do not be foolish and thoughtless but understand and firmly grasp what the will of the Lord is now let's go back a chapter to Ephesians chapter 4 famous chapter we've all heard it preached about but be a Berean here dig into the scripture yourself start with verse 11 and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers so what is the purpose of me standing here in this congregation or the prophetic gift operating or a teacher giving an overview of the books of the Bible or the evangelist was calling Sinners to the altar what is the purpose and all there has to be a purpose it's not just we throw it out there oh I believe in fivefold Ministry well what does it mean what does it matter it says it actually answers like the Bible always does you just got to read it he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ not one of the offices in Ephesians 4:11 perfects the Saints only the blood of Jesus Christ can perfect that's all that can perfect a human being is the blood of Jesus Christ but these are for the perfecting of the Saints the modern the every modern translation pretty much says for the equipping of the Saints you know what I'll read it just so you you uh believe me I know you believe me anyways but let me Ephesians 411 it says this sorry 4:12 NIV says to equip his people for the works of the Ser of service so that the body of Christ may be built up the English Standard Version to equip the Saints of the work for the work of the ministry for the building up of the body of Christ New Living Translation their responsibility is to equip God's people and to do his work and build up the church the body of Christ the new King James for the equipping of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ so this ministry is to equip us all it's not just for a pastor to be standing here trying to preach to his people it's so that all of us are able to be in this ministry in this body collectively working to further God's Ministry till until so it has to come to an end point what is the ultimate goal till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God that's very important don't forget the Son of God and all this don't forget Jesus Christ till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ manifesting his spiritual completeness and exercising our spiritual gifts in unity the body of Christ working together studying the word teaching manifesting the word so that not that we can be equal with Christ but that the ma that we would manifest the stature of the fullness of Christ and this all has a purpose also why do we come to the unity of the faith why do we manifest the spirit of Christ to that perfect man that we henceforth listen to this that we henceforth be no more children toss to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the Slate of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in weight to deceive brothers and sisters there are deceivers everywhere and we think of a deceiver maybe of this goodlooking slick tongue guy in the pull pit maybe that but think about the two sweet old Mormon couple think about them and them trying to teach others and bring others into this strange doctrine that doesn't line up with a book so who is the deceiver it's anyone it can be the sweetest old fell that you've ever met the kind old priest as we've heard before it could be anyone if they are trying to point you away from this book and this book is about one man in his name is Jesus Christ amen we just read that but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things that we may grow up in every way into him which is the head even Christ so that is the purpose of the ministry it's not to introduce people to a message or to to a certain denomination or or somehow change the point of the Gospel it's to strengthen and equip the body of Christ for the work till we all come into the unity of faith and the knowledge of the Son of God say it again till we all all come into the unity in the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God Jesus Christ that we are no longer tossed to and fro like children with every wind of Doctrine we need to know brothers and sisters this book that we are no more tossed to and fro somebody comes in with a new revelation and it's always a revelation we were talking about this yesterday it's always a new revelation I have this the Lord revealed this to me but that's good but doesn't match this word no matter how great it sounds No matter how powerful it is no matter how it lifts you up or your church up does it match this word and does it come to the knowledge of Christ let's go back to Ephesians 5 and I'll close with this verse number 14 wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepeth and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise be careful how you walk not as fools but in wisdom Redeeming the time because the days are evil don't waste our time brothers and sisters and the musicians can come to close let's not waste our time as I said I challenge you spend an hour every day studying this Bible if you can't understand it get another translation don't put yourself through something that God didn't intend for you to be through understand this word pray about this word and live this word and then if you hear something that doesn't match this word or that that seems wrong go back to the word and study it we have no excuses anymore I mean I I preach against this the little rectangular Idol I preach about it enough but it has also given us the ability to search the scriptures like never before we can use this for the good we can use this to understand better imagine if the bans had this they could have done it quicker probably but then they would have missed out on the blessings of reading of reading the Scrolls of the prophets and and brothers and sisters the some of the best times in my life early in the morning I get a cup of coffee and and sometimes I'll just open up my Bible and sayl where do you want me to read today just like I did the other day in in quiet time I I opened it up and it just happened to be in Hosea where brother Lyall was going to minister on the next the next service and very encouraging scriptures and then as I was reading and and you know don't get discouraged when you try to get be quiet before the Lord and it just ites doesn't seem to work your mind's going this way and your mind's going that way and that's how mine was I was sitting in my chair and it's I'm I'm here and I'm there and I'm thinking about this and I'm thinking about that and then after a while 30 minutes 45 minutes I started to settle down my mind started to calm and I was able to start reading the scriptures and and Hosea turned to First Corinthians and I went into there and and the Lord really gave me the answer of something that that's was on my heart for a long time and it's how that how can we have this group of people over here who are like those with James and the the the real um maybe old oldtimers the ones that that have been there for a long time and and really believe you have those and then their way of thinking and the way that they look and the way that they act and then you have over here you have people that are just coming in and they're they they are excited about the word and they're they're excited about about giving their hearts to the Lord and and we're having Miracles and we're having great great things over here and we we we have this group over here and we have this group over here and and and Paul is saying no you don't have to act the same you don't have to look the same you are different and I believe the Lord laid it on my heart don't discourage this group over here because they're right in their traditional ways those traditional ways are good those traditional ways are right but then also this group over here don't don't discourage them either no you don't have to be like this you don't have to look like this you don't have to act like this either I hope you've read the book of Galatians that's what the book's about and Paul in First Corinthians he says that over here that I can't we don't eat things sacrificed to Idols we don't we don't we don't do that because it'll offend this these these brothers over here and will cause them harm but over here he's saying the Idol's not even real it's fake there's no power to it it's just a piece of wood you're okay over here both sides are right both sides are good but don't discourage either one I'll tell you man I was I was reading that and I just felt the Holy Spirit and it came from the book it came from the Bible and here it is here it is God just coming out of this book showing me here's what I want you to do as Pastor be careful don't offend because you could cause harm you're right your understanding is right but be careful and I took it back brothers and sisters that's the thing is I took it back to the word and I just I just love it and it's it it it answers every question that you have I promise it does it's right there the answer fall in love with the Bible don't be afraid of it open it up and start reading start at the beginning or start at the end just read it and I promise you you will fall in love it is so beautiful don't waste time on other stuff as the brother said on the on the video you'll get to the end of your life and you might look back and say wow I could have been something I could have done something but I wasted my time that's what I was telling the I don't know if you walked in I was telling the the homeless guy outside bro you're wasting time you might not ever get out of this get clean get a job get an apartment start building your life up and make something and help someone else I just read about the fivefold ministry that's what it is it's for the unity of the body it's it's for the the the exalting of Jesus Christ and yet we fight and yet we argue you have this side over here and this side over here don't see things right but they should love each other like they did in this book of Acts they supported each other they helped each other they were together one one very conservative living a good life the other excited showing passion both of them working together and loving together all in the same group amen comes out of the word brothers and sisters study this word fall in love with the word and don't waste time on other things will you take the ch challenge today if you haven't heard anything that I've said listen to this get into your Bible you will never regret it that I promise you won't regret it Amen brother Josiah they that wait upon the Lord shall renew the their strength they shall Mount up with wings as he goes they shall run and not be wey they shall walk and
