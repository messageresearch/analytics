[0:00] It's our Wednesday night Bible study. I
[0:02] want to stick with the Bible study
[0:04] format that we have. I want to talk
[0:06] about we've been talking about prayer
[0:08] and it's
[0:12] it's the most important thing that we do
[0:13] in life and it's the easiest thing to
[0:16] neglect.
[0:18] So, we always want to I always want to
[0:20] encourage the congregation to don't
[0:23] neglect prayer. Don't neglect that time.
[0:26] If it's the most important thing, don't
[0:29] let it be the least important thing.
[0:32] Don't if if you got to get to work,
[0:34] well, wake up a little bit earlier. You
[0:37] know, if you're too tired to pray at
[0:40] night, then start praying a little bit
[0:42] earlier. Make it the most important
[0:44] thing. Brother Eli, I didn't recognize
[0:45] you and family. God bless you. Welcome.
[0:48] Um,
[0:50] I want to talk about tonight and I want
[0:52] to try to get done in 30 minutes. I want
[0:55] to talk about this king Hezekiah. He's
[0:57] considered the praying king. One of the
[1:00] greatest kings ever in the history of
[1:02] Judah and Israel was this man named
[1:04] Hezekiah. He uh his dad wasn't such a
[1:07] great guy. And afterwards, he was really
[1:10] Hezekiah was the last good king in all
[1:15] of the the monarchy from David all the
[1:19] way to the end is this man Hezekiah. And
[1:22] the reason he was so great is really the
[1:26] reason that anyone is great is because
[1:29] they pray. They put the Lord first. This
[1:32] man Hezekiah prayed.
[1:34] He um
[1:37] he reigned just before the captivity of
[1:41] Babylon.
[1:43] He um he is known
[1:46] really for his reforms in the church.
[1:49] We'll talk about that a little bit
[1:51] tonight. And he removed the idols and he
[1:53] restored worship in the temple. He uh
[1:56] he's also recognized because he defended
[2:01] uh Jerusalem against a a mighty army
[2:03] that came to invade. He um Hezekiah is
[2:09] known as this king that prayed so much.
[2:12] But when you hear his prayers, and I'll
[2:14] read them tonight, they're not like
[2:17] other prayers in the Bible. We read
[2:20] Solomon's prayer and it's a long
[2:23] prayer, beautiful prayer, Ezra's prayer,
[2:26] his long prayer. But when Hezekiah
[2:28] prayed, it was just short
[2:32] and it was it was to the point. One day
[2:35] things were so bad he just laid his head
[2:37] up against the wall and he just said a
[2:40] few short words and the Lord heard him.
[2:42] Another time he was going to die and he
[2:46] just asked very simply for mercy. He
[2:49] said something on the order of Lord you
[2:51] know my heart and the Lord healed him.
[2:56] Really a really great man and he was
[2:59] Hezekiah.
[3:01] He's he just one of the things that he
[3:04] did as I'm reading this is he brought
[3:06] joy to Jerusalem. And it's joy that had
[3:10] been lost for a long time. And I believe
[3:12] that I know why this joy was lost. So
[3:16] let's start. Let's get right into the
[3:18] Bible. 2 Chronicles chapter 29.
[3:30] We'll start right there. Is that Sister
[3:31] Rachel from Germany back there? God
[3:34] bless you, sister. Welcome. Is this
[3:38] Oh, your niece. Welcome, sister. God
[3:40] bless you. It's good to have you. Good
[3:42] to have you in service.
[3:44] 2 Chronicles 29 verse one, it says this.
[3:50] Hezekiah began to reign when he was five
[3:53] and 20 years old. And he reigned 9 and
[3:56] 20 years in Jerusalem.
[3:58] His mother's name was Abijah, the
[4:01] daughter of Zechariah.
[4:03] and he did that which was right in the
[4:06] sight of the Lord according to all that
[4:08] David his father had done. Again, this
[4:10] is a rare thing in the history of the
[4:12] monarchy of the kings of Judah and
[4:15] Israel.
[4:17] He in the first year of his reign, in
[4:19] the first month, opened the doors of the
[4:21] house of the Lord and repaired them.
[4:24] Notice he says that he opened the h the
[4:27] doors of the house of the Lord. Keep
[4:29] that in your mind. That's an important
[4:31] part about this testimony of this man.
[4:34] I'll get to that in a minute. And he
[4:36] brought in the priests and the Levites,
[4:38] and he gathered them together into the
[4:41] east street. And he said unto them,
[4:43] "Hear me, ye Levites." You know the
[4:45] Levites, they're like the the servants
[4:47] of the Lord that work in the temple, the
[4:50] priests. Hear me, ye Levites. Sanctify
[4:53] now yourselves and sanctify the house of
[4:55] the Lord God of your fathers and carry
[4:58] forth the filthiness out of the holy
[5:02] place.
[5:05] There's filthiness in the holy place.
[5:07] The the NIV says the defilement that's
[5:11] in this holy place. English Standard
[5:13] Version says the filth the New King
[5:16] James says this the rubbish
[5:20] that was in the church. So he's telling
[5:22] the priests, he's like, "Clean the place
[5:24] up.
[5:26] Get rid of the garbage and get rid of
[5:27] the things that defile like sinful
[5:30] things that had crept into the temple,
[5:33] into the church.
[5:35] For our fathers have trespassed and done
[5:39] that which was evil in the eyes of our
[5:41] Lord of the Lord our God, and have
[5:43] forsaken him, and have turned away their
[5:46] faces from the habitation of the Lord,
[5:48] and turned their backs."
[5:51] Also they have shut up the doors of the
[5:53] porch and put out the lamps and have not
[5:57] burned incense nor nor offered burnt
[5:59] offerings in the holy place unto the God
[6:02] of Israel. So again he's saying that
[6:07] they shut down the temple.
[6:10] There wasn't any worship going on in the
[6:11] temple. There weren't any sacrifices
[6:13] being made.
[6:16] Where of the la where wherefore the
[6:18] wrath of the Lord was upon Judah and
[6:20] Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to
[6:23] trouble, to astonishment, and to
[6:26] hissing, as ye see with your eyes. For
[6:29] lo, our fathers have fallen by the
[6:31] sword, and our sons and our daughters
[6:33] and our wives are in captivity for this.
[6:37] So Hezekiah is saying that because
[6:41] the worship has stopped, because the
[6:44] sacrifice has stopped, because the
[6:46] people aren't coming into the temple and
[6:48] worshiping anymore, that it has resulted
[6:50] in sin and it's resulted in suffering.
[6:53] Now, what happened was
[6:56] we know that
[6:58] David came. David was the second king.
[7:01] But Li and I just got just got finished
[7:03] with our series on on on Saul who was
[7:06] first and then David was second. Then
[7:09] Solomon was third and then Solomon. The
[7:12] the um monarchy split into two different
[7:16] separate nations. Israel on the south
[7:19] and Judah to the north. And then there
[7:21] was these kingdoms and they fought with
[7:23] each other and they fought with other
[7:24] people all the way down through Israel
[7:26] never had a good king. Israel after
[7:28] Solomon was there. Israel was always
[7:31] wicked kings. That was like Ahab and
[7:33] Jezebel came from Israel. Judah usually
[7:37] had bad kings, but there were some good
[7:39] ones in there. And it goes down and the
[7:43] Assyrian
[7:45] um nation attacked Israel to the south
[7:51] um to the to the south to the north to
[7:55] the north and took all of the Israelites
[8:01] captive put them into exile
[8:05] and that was pretty much it for Israel.
[8:09] It started what's called the diaspora,
[8:11] the dispersion of the Jews around the
[8:13] world. I might have said it wrong. Judah
[8:16] was in the south. Israel was in the
[8:17] north.
[8:19] And so the the 10 tribes that were in
[8:24] the north, they were dispersed out
[8:25] because this king of Syria, they came in
[8:28] and took them all. So So Hezekiah here
[8:30] is remembering that their brethren,
[8:33] their same race of people, they were
[8:35] taken. And he's he's remembering these
[8:38] things. And he says, "We have suffered
[8:40] because of this." This is before
[8:42] Nebuchadnezzar came. Now it is in mine
[8:45] heart to make a covenant with the Lord
[8:48] God of Israel that his fierce wrath may
[8:51] turn away from us. My sons, be not now
[8:56] negligent. For the Lord hath chosen you
[8:59] to stand before him, to serve him, that
[9:02] you should minister unto him and burn
[9:05] incense. Now, the reason I read these
[9:07] first 11 verses is I want to show the
[9:10] character of King Hezekiah. He cared
[9:13] about the church. He cared about living
[9:15] righteously. He cared about the priests
[9:17] and he wanted them to minister in the
[9:19] right ways. And we'll see his character
[9:22] come out when Hezekiah prays and the
[9:24] Lord answers his prayer. So he cleans up
[9:26] the church. He sets the priests in
[9:28] order. And everybody gets to work. And
[9:31] this represents major changes that are
[9:34] coming in the kingdom of Judah.
[9:37] Now, why was the church closed?
[9:41] Why was the temple closed? Hezekiah's
[9:44] dad, very evil man, this king Ahaz.
[9:51] Ahaz came in and he shut down the
[9:55] temple. And he told the people,
[9:59] he said, "You just go to your own place
[10:02] and worship." He said, "Just set up
[10:05] place, just go set up places in your
[10:07] little areas and all that, and you don't
[10:09] come into the temple. You just stay
[10:10] home. You you worship at home." And look
[10:13] at what happens when this happens,
[10:17] friends. Coming to church, and you know,
[10:19] I'm not a pastor that beats you over the
[10:20] head and tells you to come to church all
[10:22] the time, but coming to church is a
[10:24] blessing.
[10:25] &gt;&gt; And when you let when you when you just
[10:28] make that sacrifice, you just make that
[10:31] effort, there's a blessing there.
[10:33] &gt;&gt; I mean, how many of us have really
[10:36] regretted ever going? You know, you come
[10:39] home. How many of us have come home and
[10:41] said, "You know, I really regret going
[10:42] to church tonight."
[10:44] &gt;&gt; But how many times
[10:47] have we said,
[10:49] "Boy, I regret wasting that last hour
[10:52] scrolling on the little idol."
[10:54] &gt;&gt; How many times have I said that?
[10:57] &gt;&gt; How many times have I said, "Wow, I I
[10:59] just wasted two hours and did nothing."
[11:03] But when you come to church, it's not
[11:04] like that. There's an effort that you
[11:06] make in coming and you have the church
[11:08] doors open and on Wednesday night
[11:10] there's a there's a good crowd here
[11:11] tonight but there may not be very many
[11:13] people coming but you get the blessing
[11:16] in coming. It's it's a blessing just to
[11:18] walk into the doors
[11:20] &gt;&gt; and then and then King Ahaz shut that
[11:23] down.
[11:24] &gt;&gt; He said you just stay in your own place.
[11:27] You worship in your own place. And what
[11:30] happened? And the people sin started to
[11:33] enter into the people.
[11:36] They started sinning. They started not
[11:39] giving God the time that they should
[11:42] have given him. The prayer life
[11:44] suffered. Many, many things suffered
[11:48] just because he closed the door to the
[11:51] church.
[11:53] Sin came in. And even the temple, it sat
[11:57] around for a long time. They weren't
[12:00] sweeping the floors. They weren't
[12:01] keeping the walls painted. They weren't
[12:03] fixing things. When you let a building
[12:06] sit, it just gets dilapidated over time.
[12:09] They weren't doing anything. They
[12:11] weren't replacing the carpet. They
[12:13] weren't they weren't cleaning the the
[12:15] walls. They weren't doing anything. And
[12:16] it just started to get dirty and there
[12:19] started to get trash around. And then
[12:22] they would they would come in and they
[12:23] wouldn't respect the building. They
[12:24] would do things that they shouldn't be
[12:26] doing inside the building. they would
[12:28] maybe let things come in that weren't
[12:30] clean. And it just it ended up to be a
[12:33] stink in God's nostrils from this King
[12:36] Ahaz. And so his son, and remember this
[12:39] is his son Hezekiah.
[12:41] His son comes in and like, "No, that's
[12:44] not right. Let's clean this place up."
[12:47] So he gets all the priests together. He
[12:49] gets all the ministers and all the
[12:50] Levites and he says, "Listen," he says,
[12:53] "Get to work. let's get this place
[12:56] cleaned up. And they got the place
[12:59] cleaned up and it and they got their
[13:01] lives cleaned up. So, it was it was just
[13:04] it was amazing. And it worked. Just
[13:07] cleaning up the temple and bringing back
[13:11] the sac sacrifices
[13:13] brought holiness
[13:16] to Judah.
[13:18] They brought singing back. was telling
[13:21] brother Jo, brother Josiah, it's one of
[13:23] the things that when they cleaned up and
[13:25] they started coming to church, it
[13:27] brought singing. They probably weren't
[13:30] singing before
[13:32] and they and and the the Bible mentions
[13:34] singing over and over that they started
[13:37] singing again. It brought the sacrifice
[13:39] back. It brought tithing back. It
[13:42] brought worship back. And it also
[13:44] brought joy back into the hearts of the
[13:47] people. Verse number, let's skip down to
[13:50] verse number 28. Listen to this.
[13:53] And all the congregation worshiped. This
[13:56] is when they got everything in order.
[13:57] And all the congregation worshiped and
[13:59] the singers sang and the trumpeters
[14:02] sounded. And all this continued until
[14:05] the burnt offering was finished. And
[14:07] when they had made an end of the
[14:08] offering, the king and all the people
[14:10] that were present with them bowed
[14:13] themselves and worshiped.
[14:16] Moreover, King Hezekiah, Moreover,
[14:19] Hezekiah the king and the princes
[14:21] commanded the Levites to sing praise
[14:23] unto the Lord with words of David
[14:27] and of Asaf the singer the seer. Sounds
[14:30] familiar, doesn't it? The Psalms.
[14:33] Asaf was one of the one of the authors
[14:35] main authors of the Psalms. And then
[14:37] here's David, one of the main authors.
[14:39] So, they were singing these psalms, some
[14:41] of which we sing today. And they sang
[14:44] praises with gladness and they bowed
[14:46] their heads and worshiped.
[14:51] So how could they have sang songs of
[14:53] praise like this if they were stay
[14:56] staying home from church?
[15:00] You may not agree with the pastor. You
[15:02] may not agree with some of the doctrines
[15:04] in the church. Not necessarily at this
[15:06] church, but at any church really.
[15:10] But in going to church, you have the
[15:12] opportunity to sing together.
[15:15] &gt;&gt; You have the opportunity to worship
[15:17] together. Maybe you don't have the exact
[15:20] same beliefs on certain things, but
[15:23] don't let that keep you home. Don't let
[15:26] that separate you from the other
[15:28] believers.
[15:30] &gt;&gt; Come together and if nothing else, sing.
[15:35] And the people, they brought their
[15:36] sacrifices in and they brought their
[15:38] offerings into the church and they had
[15:40] church. They worshiped together.
[15:44] Skip to verse number 36. Are you liking
[15:47] this King Hezekiah?
[15:50] Let's go. Actually, let's go to 35.
[15:51] Sorry.
[15:53] And also the burnt offerings were in
[15:55] abundance with the fat of the peace
[15:57] offerings and the drink off offerings
[15:59] for every burnt offering. So the service
[16:01] of the house of the Lord was set in
[16:04] order.
[16:06] And Hezekiah rejoiced and all the people
[16:09] that God had prepared the and all that
[16:11] and that God had prepared for the people
[16:14] for the thing was done suddenly.
[16:17] Let me read the New Living Translation
[16:19] of that common English.
[16:21] It says this. There was an abundance of
[16:24] burnt offerings along with the usual
[16:26] liquid offerings and a great deal of fat
[16:29] from the many peace offerings. So the
[16:31] temple of the Lord was restored to
[16:34] service. And Hezekiah and all the people
[16:36] rejoiced because of what God had done
[16:38] for the people for everything had been
[16:40] accomplished so quickly.
[16:44] Let's go on to second Let's go on to
[16:46] second Chronicles
[16:48] um chapter 30. So Hezekiah,
[16:52] he sends a letter. So things are going
[16:54] good. He's got he's got everything in
[16:56] order. Things things are are working
[16:58] out.
[17:00] And he sends out a a letter. Remember I
[17:03] said that Israel had been dispersed.
[17:08] He sends out a letter not only to Judah,
[17:12] to his country, but he sends it out also
[17:16] to Israel and to all those other people.
[17:18] It's like, listen, I don't care if we
[17:20] were separate before. I don't care.
[17:23] We're all Jews. We all believe together.
[17:26] And he invites them. He says, "Come in
[17:29] and celebrate the Passover with us." So,
[17:32] he sends out this letter. And uh let me
[17:35] just read I want to read the the New
[17:37] Living Translation of this letter,
[17:39] common English,
[17:42] and you'll get really you'll get the
[17:45] understanding. Listen to the spirit
[17:46] that's in this letter. So this is the
[17:48] letter that King Hezekiah pens and sends
[17:51] it out across the old the whole area
[17:55] that's there. Oh people of Israel,
[18:00] return to the Lord,
[18:02] the God of Abraham, Isaac, and of
[18:05] Israel, so that he will return to the
[18:08] few of us who have survived the conquest
[18:10] of the Assyrian kings. I mentioned that
[18:13] before.
[18:15] Do not be like your ancestors and
[18:17] relatives who abandon the Lord, the God
[18:19] of their ancestors, and become an object
[18:21] of derision as you yourself can see.
[18:24] Don't be stubborn, he says, as they
[18:28] were, but submit yourselves to the Lord.
[18:33] Come to his temple which has been which
[18:36] has set apart as holy forever.
[18:40] Worship the Lord your God so that his
[18:43] fierce anger anger will turn away from
[18:45] you. For if you return to the Lord, your
[18:49] relatives and your children will be
[18:51] treated mercifully by their captives and
[18:53] they will be able to return to this
[18:56] land.
[18:58] For the Lord your God is gracious and
[19:00] merciful. If you return to him, he will
[19:02] not continue to turn his face from you.
[19:06] And he sends this letter all over the
[19:08] place to those that
[19:12] maybe that were at war with each other
[19:14] for for all of these hundreds of years.
[19:18] And he sends it out and he's like,
[19:19] "Listen, everybody,
[19:21] everybody come back." And they come in
[19:24] and they celebrate the Passover for
[19:27] seven days as that was the tradition.
[19:29] And they were enjoying the church so
[19:31] much. And they were enjoying the singing
[19:34] so much. And they were enjoying the
[19:36] fellowship so much and the worship so
[19:39] much that they said, "Uh, hey Hezekiah,
[19:44] you know, I know the Passover is only
[19:45] seven days, but how about we make it
[19:48] seven more days?"
[19:51] Isaiah or Hezekiah says, "Yeah." All
[19:54] right. So then Hezekiah dip dips in and
[19:57] he donates. of course this is going to
[19:59] be cost a lot. So he starts giving oxins
[20:02] and and he g he starts giving these
[20:04] animals to the to the people to help
[20:06] them and and for sacrifices and that and
[20:09] then they worship not just seven days as
[20:12] required by the Passover but they wanted
[20:13] to come to church. They loved it. It was
[20:17] such a blessing. So they said let's
[20:19] let's just stay. Let's just keep going
[20:21] to church.
[20:24] And they worshiped another seven days.
[20:28] 2 Chronicles verse uh 2 Chronicles
[20:31] 30:23.
[20:34] And the whole assembly took counsel to
[20:37] keep other seven days another seven
[20:39] days. And they kept another seven days
[20:41] with gladness.
[20:44] With gladness. They were so sad.
[20:47] They were so down.
[20:49] They were depressed. Maybe they didn't
[20:52] see any hope. But they got together.
[20:54] They got to come to church. They got to
[20:56] worship together. They hadn't done this
[20:58] in so long. And it just encouraged them.
[21:01] They loved it. And there's joy. There
[21:04] was there's just joy spreading
[21:06] throughout all of these Jewish people.
[21:08] And they're just they're so happy. For
[21:10] Hezekiah, the king of Judah, did give to
[21:13] the congregation a thousand bullocks and
[21:15] 7,000 sheep. And the princes gave to the
[21:17] congregation a thousand bullocks and
[21:19] 10,000 sheep. And a great number of
[21:22] priests sanctified themselves. So from
[21:24] the top to the bottom they made they
[21:26] they gave.
[21:29] They were generous.
[21:33] And all the congregation of Judah with
[21:35] the priests and the Levites and all the
[21:37] congregation that came out of Israel and
[21:39] the strangers that came out of the land
[21:41] of Israel and that dwelt in Judah
[21:44] rejoiced.
[21:47] I thought, "Oh man, it feels so good to
[21:51] come back to church. It feels so good to
[21:54] sing. It feels so good to hear the word.
[21:58] It just feels good." So there was great
[22:01] joy in Jerusalem. For since the time of
[22:03] Solomon, the son of David, king of
[22:06] Israel, there was not like there was not
[22:08] the like in Jerusalem. Then the priests,
[22:12] the Levites arose and blessed the people
[22:14] and their voice was heard and their
[22:16] prayer came up to his holy dwelling
[22:19] place even unto heaven.
[22:22] They were so happy. They worshiped so
[22:23] sincerely and their prayers were heard
[22:27] beyond the temple. Brother Aaron, their
[22:29] prayers went all the way up to heaven
[22:33] and were heard. It was truly a good day
[22:37] in Jerusalem
[22:39] because King Hezekiah made changes. He
[22:42] cleaned up and he gave the opportunity
[22:44] for everyone to come in and worship. So,
[22:48] let's skip over to 2 Chronicles
[22:51] uh chapter 31. Now, let's go to verse
[22:55] 20.
[23:00] Pretty soon we'll get to Hezekiah's
[23:02] prayer. And thus did Hezekiah throughout
[23:04] all Judah, and wrought that which was
[23:06] good and right and truth before the Lord
[23:08] his God. And in every work that he began
[23:11] in the service of the house of God and
[23:13] in the law and in the commandments to
[23:15] seek, this is what Hezekiah is teaching.
[23:18] This is what this is what all of this
[23:19] led to. All of his work to seek his God.
[23:23] He did it with all his heart and he
[23:26] prospered.
[23:29] We'll read that again. And in every work
[23:31] he began in the service of the house of
[23:32] God and in the law and in the
[23:34] commandments to seek his God,
[23:38] he did it with all his heart and he
[23:40] prospered. So Hezekiah truly sought God
[23:42] in everything that he did. How do you
[23:44] seek God? You pray.
[23:47] So we know that Hezekiah was a praying
[23:49] man.
[23:52] And prayer takes time.
[23:55] And you can't just
[23:59] drop down
[24:01] and pray when you have a need. Pray
[24:03] needs to be every day,
[24:06] multiple times a day. Paul said, I pray.
[24:09] Paul said to pray always.
[24:12] So you get up in the morning before
[24:14] before you get up, lay in when you're
[24:15] laying in bed, pray and then get up and
[24:20] then pray again. Go to work or whatever
[24:23] you do. Stop at lunchtime and pray. Pray
[24:26] in the evening. And if you're not
[24:30] praying every day of your life, then the
[24:32] time when the time comes that you need
[24:34] to contact God, how can you expect that
[24:36] God is going to hear you?
[24:39] If you're not praying all the time, if
[24:41] you don't know how to pray, that's one
[24:42] of the things the disciples asked Jesus.
[24:45] They saw that he was praying all the
[24:47] time. The son of God,
[24:49] Jesus was constantly praying. And they
[24:51] looked at Jesus and I maybe if the
[24:54] Lord's willing I'll talk about this on
[24:56] Sunday. But they looked at Jesus. They
[24:57] didn't ask him how do we cast out
[24:59] devils? How do we do miracles? How do we
[25:01] create? How do we multiply the fishes
[25:03] and the loaves? What was their question?
[25:04] The most question important question
[25:06] they asked him how do we pray?
[25:10] It was important because they saw that
[25:12] was the most important thing to Jesus.
[25:15] We need to be in constant communication
[25:17] with him on our knees standing.
[25:22] When you're driving, don't close your
[25:24] eyes, but you can still talk to him.
[25:29] And he can talk back
[25:32] all the time. It doesn't have to be in a
[25:35] special way. Constantly praying. Then
[25:39] when troubles hit
[25:42] in your life or someone else needs your
[25:45] prayers,
[25:47] then you're practiced. You're ready to
[25:49] go and you'll pray.
[25:54] Pray is prayer is
[25:58] it it's it's it's constantly. It's it's
[26:01] it's all the time. And it's like
[26:05] you don't just
[26:07] people say that. No, I I pray a lot and
[26:09] and what they're talking about is that
[26:11] they think about God a lot. That's not
[26:13] praying.
[26:15] And my relationship with Stephanie, it's
[26:18] like
[26:19] if I if I just think about her, that
[26:22] doesn't build my relationship with her.
[26:25] We need to communicate.
[26:28] We need to be a husband and a wife. We
[26:30] need to be constantly talking and we
[26:32] need to fellowship and we need to love
[26:34] each other. And if I came home, if if I
[26:36] hadn't seen Stephanie in a week and
[26:38] she's like, "Honey, how come you didn't
[26:39] call me when you were gone?" "Well, I
[26:40] thought about you." That doesn't do any
[26:42] good.
[26:44] We need that fellowship.
[26:46] And that's how prayer is. So Hezekiah
[26:49] was this man of prayer. So when he
[26:52] needed it, he was ready to pray. Things
[26:56] were going good in Jerusalem. Things
[26:58] were going good in the temple. The
[27:01] people were coming together. The people
[27:02] were praying. The people were getting
[27:04] closer to God. God was blessing them.
[27:06] They were able to pay their tithes now.
[27:08] They were able to worship. They were
[27:10] able to sing. But when you are in God's
[27:14] will, when you are tr truly serving God,
[27:19] don't think that you are not a target of
[27:22] the devil.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; When I believe it was Paul said, "When I
[27:29] would do good, evil is present with me.
[27:33] And here's what happened with this man
[27:36] Hezekiah. Things were going well, but
[27:39] there was an evil spirit in that same
[27:43] kingdom of Assyria.
[27:46] And it anointed this king of Syria named
[27:49] Sinakarb.
[27:51] And Sinakarb had it on his mind that he
[27:55] was going to invade and take Jerusalem.
[28:00] Here's
[28:01] Hezekiah first 2 Chronicles chapter 32
[28:07] verse number 10. And sonakarb. This guy
[28:11] was intimidating. This guy was ruthless.
[28:14] And this guy wanted Jerusalem.
[28:18] 2 Chronicles 32:10. And he writes this
[28:22] letter, sends it out all over the place.
[28:25] And he says, "Thus saith Sinakarb, king
[28:28] of Assyria, wherein do you trust that ye
[28:31] abide in the siege of Jerusalem?" He's
[28:34] like, "I got Jerusalem seized." You
[28:36] think, you think you're going to live
[28:37] through this?
[28:39] Does not Hezekiah persuade you to give
[28:41] over yourselves to die by famine and by
[28:44] thirst, saying, "The Lord our God shall
[28:46] deliver us out of the hand of the king
[28:48] of Assyria."
[28:50] Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away
[28:53] his high places and his altars and
[28:56] commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying,
[28:59] "You shall worship before one altar and
[29:02] burn incense upon it." So he's he's
[29:04] saying that this guy took away your fun.
[29:07] This guy took away your partying.
[29:10] This guy took away your idolatry. And
[29:13] you know how much do you like that?
[29:16] And this guy Hezekiah took it away.
[29:22] Know ye not
[29:24] what I and my fathers have done unto all
[29:27] the people of other lands? They knew
[29:30] that it had happened to their brethren
[29:33] in Israel.
[29:36] Were the gods of the nations of those
[29:38] lands anyway? Were the gods of the
[29:41] nations of those lands any ways able to
[29:44] deliver their hands out of out of my
[29:46] hand? Who was there among the all the
[29:49] gods of the nations that my fathers
[29:51] utterly destroyed
[29:57] that could deliver his people out of my
[29:59] hand?
[30:00] That your God should be able to deliver
[30:02] you out of my hand. Whoa.
[30:07] this arrogant king. He's insulting
[30:10] Hezekiah.
[30:12] He's insulting their walk with the Lord.
[30:15] He's insulting their commitments that
[30:17] they have made to serve the Lord. And
[30:19] now he is insulting God himself.
[30:23] And he's trying to get them to lose
[30:24] their faith.
[30:26] Now therefore, let not Hezekiah deceive
[30:28] you nor persuade you on this manner.
[30:31] Neither yet neither yet believe him. For
[30:33] no god of any nation or kingdom was able
[30:36] to deliver his people out of my hand,
[30:39] and out of the hand of my fathers. How
[30:41] much less shall your God deliver you out
[30:44] of my hand?
[30:46] And his servants spake yet more against
[30:49] the Lord and against Hezek and against
[30:51] his servant Hezekiah. Hezekiah was a man
[30:54] of prayer.
[30:56] And he had a friend who was a man of
[30:59] prayer also. You know who that friend
[31:01] was? Anybody?
[31:05] &gt;&gt; The prophet Isaiah.
[31:08] Now watch what they do. Let's skip to
[31:10] verse 20.
[31:12] And for this cause Hezekiah the king and
[31:16] the prophet Isaiah the son of Amos
[31:18] prayed and cried to heaven. So the
[31:21] praying king and the praying prophet
[31:24] cried out to the one that had answered
[31:26] so many prayers before.
[31:29] And the Lord sent an angel
[31:32] which cut off all the mighty men of
[31:35] valor and the the leaders and the
[31:37] captains in the camp of the king of
[31:38] Assyria. And so he returned with shame
[31:41] of his face to his own land. And when he
[31:45] was come into the house of his God, they
[31:47] that came forth of his own bowels slew
[31:50] him there with the sword. His own family
[31:53] killed him.
[31:54] Not only did the Lord deliver Judah
[31:57] because of Hezekiah's prayer,
[32:00] but look at what happened to the one
[32:02] that Hezekiah was praying about.
[32:05] Didn't work out so well for Sonakaribb.
[32:09] Thus, the Lord saved Hezekiah and the
[32:12] inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand
[32:14] of Snakaribb, the king of Assyria, and
[32:17] from the hand of all other, and guided
[32:19] them on every side.
[32:22] And many brought gifts unto the Lord of
[32:24] the Lord. Many got brought gifts unto
[32:26] the Lord to Jerusalem and present and
[32:29] presents to Hezekiah, king of Judah, so
[32:33] that he was magnified in the sight of
[32:34] all nations from then forth.
[32:38] In those days, Hezekiah was sick unto
[32:40] death. So, we see how Hezekiah prayed
[32:44] and the Lord delivered.
[32:46] Sent an angel. Let me go really back for
[32:49] a moment. Remember what I talked about
[32:51] on on Sunday morning about humility?
[32:55] And remember all those saraphims that
[32:57] were going around the um the throne of
[33:00] God and they were crying holy, holy,
[33:02] holy and they had their faces covered.
[33:04] They had their feet covered in reverence
[33:07] and their wings.
[33:09] And then there's in Revelation, I
[33:11] believe chapter five, we see that there
[33:14] were a hundred million angels
[33:17] circling around the throne of God. 100
[33:19] million angels. And look what happened
[33:23] when God sent one
[33:25] &gt;&gt; down, just one of them. And he's like,
[33:28] "You go." One angel
[33:32] destroyed
[33:34] that king. One of the most powerful
[33:36] kings in the world. One angel. And think
[33:38] about how great God is. A 100red million
[33:40] of them going around his throne.
[33:43] That was a
[33:45] Got off the offramp. We'll get back on.
[33:49] Where was I? Verse number 24. In those
[33:51] days, Hezekiah was sick to death, and he
[33:54] prayed unto the Lord, and he spake unto
[33:57] him, and he gave him a sign. We'll talk
[34:00] about this in a minute. But Hezekiah
[34:02] rendered not again according to the
[34:04] benefit done unto him, for his heart was
[34:07] lifted up. Remember Sunday morning
[34:10] about pride
[34:12] and how it can bring you down. And here
[34:15] Hezekiah's heart was lifted up.
[34:18] Therefore, there was wrath upon him and
[34:20] upon Judah and Jerusalem. So, even the
[34:23] praying king, he got a little prideful
[34:26] and God takes his hand off of this great
[34:29] man, one of the greatest kings that's
[34:30] ever lived. He just takes his hand off
[34:32] of Hezekiah and he fa he falls falls
[34:35] sick.
[34:37] But not for long. Notwithstanding,
[34:40] Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride
[34:44] of his heart.
[34:46] both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
[34:48] so that the wrath of the Lord came not
[34:51] upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
[34:53] Let me read another translation. New
[34:55] Living Translation says this. It says
[34:57] about that time Hezekiah became deathly
[34:59] ill. He prayed to the Lord who healed
[35:02] him and gave him a miraculous sign. But
[35:04] Hezekiah did not respond appropriately
[35:06] to the kindness showed to him and he
[35:08] became proud. So the Lord's anger came
[35:11] against him and against Judah and
[35:12] Jerusalem. Then Hezekiah humbled himself
[35:15] and repented of his pride
[35:18] as did the people of Jerusalem. So the
[35:20] Lord's anger did not fall on them during
[35:22] Hezekiah's lifetime.
[35:26] So I want to go I want to move over to
[35:29] Second Kings chapter 20 and let's learn
[35:31] about this sickness a little bit that
[35:33] came upon Hezekiah.
[35:37] Let's go to 2 Kings 20 verse one and
[35:40] we'll finish with this. In those days
[35:43] was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the
[35:46] prophet Isaiah the son of Amos came to
[35:48] him and said unto him, "Thus sayeth the
[35:51] Lord, set thine house in order, for thou
[35:53] shalt die and not live."
[35:57] I like this part.
[36:00] Then he turned his face to the wall and
[36:03] he prayed unto the Lord saying, "How
[36:07] beautiful it was just you ever been
[36:09] there before where just you're so down
[36:13] and you just like
[36:16] Lord help me."
[36:18] That's all he did. He put his face to
[36:21] the wall
[36:24] and he said this. He said, "I beseech
[36:26] thee,
[36:27] oh Lord, remember now how high I have
[36:30] walked before thee in truth
[36:33] and with a perfect heart, and I've done
[36:37] that which is good in thy sight." And
[36:40] Hezekiah wept sore. So short, simple
[36:45] prayer. It doesn't matter how great your
[36:47] prayer is. What matters is that God
[36:50] heard it.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; And that's what matters with us. You
[36:53] don't have to have perfect words. You
[36:55] just you just have to be sincere and you
[36:58] have to be prayed up. You have to know
[37:00] how to pray. And Hezekiah just lays his
[37:03] head up against the wall and he just
[37:04] says he says, "Lord, I beseech you,
[37:07] remember me now how I've walked before
[37:10] thee in truth and with a perfect heart."
[37:12] How many of us can say it really, Lord,
[37:14] you know my heart. I make mistakes and
[37:17] mistakes and mistakes. But Lord, you can
[37:20] look into my heart and you can see I
[37:22] want to be right. I really do.
[37:26] I believe that there are people here
[37:27] that we can say that. Lord, I've walked
[37:30] before you perfectly. Not because I
[37:32] haven't sinned,
[37:34] but Lord, I want to be right. You know
[37:37] my heart. You know my motives. Just as
[37:40] Hezekiah said here that I've walked with
[37:43] before you with a perfect heart. And it
[37:45] came to pass before Isa Isaiah was gone
[37:49] out of the middle court that the word of
[37:51] the Lord came to him saying. So he goes
[37:53] and tells Hezekiah. He turns around and
[37:57] then boom. Oh, go back.
[38:02] Turn again. Tell tell Hezekiah the
[38:04] captain of my people. Thus sayaeth the
[38:06] Lord God of David thy father. I have
[38:08] heard thy prayer. I have seen thy tears.
[38:12] Behold, I will heal thee.
[38:15] On the third day, thou shalt go up unto
[38:17] the house of the Lord, and I will add
[38:19] unto thy days 15 years,
[38:24] and I will deliver thee and this city
[38:26] out of the hand of the king of Assyria,
[38:28] and I will defend this city for my own
[38:30] sake, and for my servant David's sake.
[38:35] So we see from 2 Chronicles that I read
[38:37] earlier that Hezekiah got a little
[38:39] hottie when I talked about on Sunday.
[38:43] But then he quickly he humbled himself.
[38:49] So all of the days of Hezekiah,
[38:52] the Lord didn't bring
[38:55] this
[38:57] suffering on
[39:00] Jerusalem.
[39:01] And Hezekiah, what he did is he bragged.
[39:05] People came from another country, this
[39:08] country called Babylon,
[39:10] and he brought the people in. He's like,
[39:12] "Oh, come here. Come check out come
[39:14] check out our our church. Come check it
[39:17] out. Come, come look at how great it is.
[39:20] Oh, oh, and come into this room. Look at
[39:22] all our gold.
[39:24] Look at how look at how good God's been
[39:25] to us." And then come over to this room
[39:28] and and it's like, "Oh, look at this.
[39:29] Look at how great this is." And these
[39:31] men are walking in like, "Yeah,
[39:34] yeah."
[39:36] And they're thinking, "Wow, there's a
[39:38] lot of money going into this." They go
[39:41] back
[39:42] to the king of Babylon,
[39:46] this guy that was way bigger
[39:49] than Sinakarb. His name's
[39:51] Nebuchadnezzar.
[39:53] And they tell him,
[39:55] and then Hezekiah passes away.
[39:59] And then Nebuchadnezzar comes into
[40:01] Jerusalem and that was you know the
[40:04] story after that it's pretty much over.
[40:06] But it didn't happen in all the days of
[40:08] Hezekiah because Hezekiah prayed
[40:12] and as I said you can't be a good
[40:16] athlete if you're not on the field
[40:18] practicing if you're not communicating.
[40:20] And you can't have a good relationship
[40:23] with God if you are not praying all the
[40:26] time. You can't really expect your
[40:28] prayers to be heard and answered
[40:31] if you're not constantly communicating
[40:34] with them. Amen. That's the story of
[40:36] Hezekiah. I wanted to end a little bit
[40:38] early because I wanted to ask the
[40:40] audience. So, we I was able to give an
[40:43] example of someone who who I really
[40:46] think was one of the most powerful
[40:49] praying people in the Bible. Now, I sent
[40:53] out my WhatsApp this morning.
[40:56] Can Who's another one? And we'll spend
[40:59] maybe 10, 15 minutes
[41:01] &gt;&gt; going through. Say this again.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; Daniel.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; Daniel.
[41:06] Does anybody know why Daniel? The Bible
[41:08] records Daniel
[41:11] praying three times a day. And not only
[41:15] would he pray three times a day, but he
[41:17] would open the window up. He did not
[41:20] care if his colleagues at work saw him
[41:23] praying. It didn't matter to him. He got
[41:25] down. He looked towards the temple in
[41:27] Jerusalem, the same one that Hezekiah
[41:30] rebuilt. Daniel looked towards that
[41:33] temple. And he bowed his knees and he
[41:36] prayed just as Solomon who built the
[41:38] temple said, "Lord, if they would just
[41:41] look to this temple, then you will hear
[41:44] their prayers." And here is Daniel. And
[41:46] he's praying and he's looking towards
[41:48] this temple. And when Daniel was one of
[41:51] the times that he was praying is when
[41:53] Nebuchadnezzar said that I'm going to
[41:58] kill all of the wise men. And Daniel and
[42:01] his buddies Shadrach, Meshach, and
[42:03] Abedneo were part of that group. And he
[42:05] said, I'm going to kill all of you if
[42:08] you can't tell me my dream.
[42:11] So they were all in peril. So what does
[42:14] Daniel do?
[42:17] What would you do?
[42:20] He prayed and he asked his friends to
[42:23] pray and then the Lord gave him the
[42:27] interpret gave him the dream that
[42:29] Nebuchadnezzar had and the
[42:30] interpretation. How about another one?
[42:34] Who?
[42:37] Jeremy. Esther. Queen Esther.
[42:41] Oh, I didn't expect you to say that one.
[42:49] the whole
[42:51] it wasn't just Esther.
[42:54] It wasn't just her three friends
[42:57] that were in danger.
[42:59] It was the entire group of Jewish people
[43:05] in this city
[43:08] and these people because of this man
[43:11] Hmon.
[43:14] I'm gonna I'm gonna Can I go off an
[43:15] offramp real quick? Um on Sunday I
[43:18] talked about again about um
[43:22] about being humble and humility before
[43:25] the Lord. So this man Hmon, he was kind
[43:29] of the one of the main guys for the king
[43:33] and he hated these Jewish people and he
[43:37] got invited. So Esther invites this man
[43:41] Hmon who devised this plan to kill all
[43:44] of all of the Jewish people. And Esther,
[43:47] of course, she she's praying and she the
[43:50] the Lord just gave her such strength.
[43:54] And she sets up this plan that Hmon is
[43:57] going to be there. This this main killer
[44:00] that's building these gallows up. And
[44:04] Hmon goes home to his wife. Remember I
[44:08] talked about humility? You know what he
[44:10] did? He bragged.
[44:13] He said, "Honey, I got invited to the
[44:15] king the king's house tonight
[44:18] and I got invited to this banquet."
[44:22] And Esther, this praying sister, strong
[44:26] sister,
[44:28] she wasn't allowed to approach the king,
[44:30] but she did at that time. And she said,
[44:32] "Basically, this guy's trying to kill us
[44:35] all."
[44:37] and saved all of her people. And guess
[44:40] what happened to Hmon? Same thing that
[44:43] happened to Sakaribb. Didn't work out
[44:45] well for him. How about somebody else?
[44:48] Another another one.
[44:51] Another person that prayed.
[44:54] Jonah. I preached Caleb. I preached
[44:57] about Jonah the other day.
[45:00] Never in history has someone needed to
[45:05] pray worse than Jonah.
[45:08] He was in the belly of a whale at the
[45:12] bottom of the ocean with seaweed wrapped
[45:15] around his neck. By the way, and on
[45:18] Jonah, as I was researching Jonah, they
[45:21] actually, whether it's true or not, I
[45:23] don't know, but it's it's a fairly
[45:24] modern story of someone who fell out of
[45:28] a ship and was swallowed by a sperm
[45:31] whale. And this sperm whale swallowed
[45:34] this poor sailor. And he actually was in
[45:37] the belly of this sperm whale for two
[45:39] days.
[45:41] And the sperm whale puked him up. And
[45:46] the only thing that was wrong with him
[45:48] was his skin
[45:50] was really messed up
[45:53] um because of the acids that were in the
[45:55] in the whale's stomach. But he actually
[45:57] survived. So there's actually a modern
[46:00] event. Well, I I mean it says internet
[46:03] says it's true.
[46:09] So So anyways, the Bible says Jonah's
[46:13] true. So, so Jonah's in the whale in the
[46:17] belly of this whale and he is like, "If
[46:20] I could just look at Jerusalem and he
[46:23] prayed
[46:24] and God heard his prayer
[46:26] &gt;&gt; and he took everything that Jonah had
[46:28] done wrong and Jonah had really messed
[46:30] up and then he turned it around and he
[46:33] saved a whole city because of Jonah's
[46:37] prayer that the Lord would have mercy on
[46:39] him."
[46:41] The whale went up, spit him out. He went
[46:43] and he preached to these gentile people
[46:46] and the ra and they repented.
[46:49] That doesn't happen very often. They
[46:51] repented and the wrath of the Lord was
[46:53] stayed. How about one more?
[46:56] &gt;&gt; David,
[46:58] we going to sing that song at the end.
[47:00] Come on, brother Aaron. All right.
[47:05] David prayed a lot. We just read the
[47:08] book of Psalms.
[47:10] But um there was one time
[47:14] that David had to go to battle and he
[47:18] didn't know do I go or do I stay
[47:23] and David had prayed so much and David
[47:27] was so in tune with God as I said you
[47:31] can't just all of a sudden it's like
[47:33] Lord what do I do and get down and pray
[47:35] you have to pray all the time and then
[47:37] when these situations arise eyes, then
[47:40] you can go to prayer. And here is David
[47:42] and he's saying, "Lord, this is a great
[47:44] battle. What do I do? I don't know. Do I
[47:46] go to battle? Do I fight this enemy? Do
[47:48] I stay home? Lord, I don't know what to
[47:50] do." And he was, David was so in tune
[47:53] with God that he knew, here comes this
[47:57] breeze
[47:59] and he hears the malberry trees start to
[48:02] shake. And he knew God was in that
[48:06] breeze. And he knew God was with them to
[48:08] go to battle.
[48:10] And David prayed and the Lord answered.
[48:14] Amen. One more.
[48:20] Jesus prayed a lot. That's one thing
[48:23] about Jesus. He prayed all the time.
[48:26] Jesus went up to the mountain to pray.
[48:29] Very beginning of his ministry. Is that
[48:31] what you're talking about? The
[48:32] beginning. The beginning of his
[48:34] ministry. Jesus went up to the mountain
[48:37] to pray as brother Aaron said.
[48:41] And the son of God,
[48:44] God in flesh,
[48:46] had a very important decision to make.
[48:49] He had to choose 12 men
[48:53] for him to give his ministry to and to
[48:56] represent him on the field.
[49:00] And Jesus didn't just go up and pray.
[49:04] That time Jesus prayed all night long.
[49:10] And then the next day he chose his 12
[49:12] disciples.
[49:14] Amen. All right, let's uh musicians can
[49:18] come and we'll close. Isn't prayer
[49:22] beautiful? It is. It is the most well,
[49:25] brother Brandham said it is the most
[49:27] powerful
[49:29] weapon ever placed into the hands of man
[49:33] is prayer. We see Hezekiah brought down
[49:36] a whole country, one angel. God sent
[49:39] down, heard Hezekiah's prayer. God sent
[49:41] down an angel,
[49:44] destroyed the kingdom. Elijah. Elijah
[49:48] prayed
[49:50] and he went up to Ahab and he says he
[49:54] says, "Ahab, you're such a sinner.
[49:57] You're doing all this stuff wrong." He
[49:59] says, "Not even due nor rain will fall
[50:01] until I call for it."
[50:04] Book of James, I believe, or I don't
[50:06] know if it was James or one of Peter's
[50:08] epistles said that he prayed
[50:13] and it didn't rain for three and a half
[50:14] years. And then he prayed again
[50:18] and it rained. Can you imagine one man,
[50:21] brother Jeremy? One man praying and
[50:25] shutting off the rain and bringing a
[50:27] famine where probably tens of thousands
[50:29] of people died. And then that same man
[50:31] going before the Lord and asking the
[50:34] Lord to to to send the rain three and a
[50:37] half years later. And he sends the rain.
[50:39] And you know what James said? James
[50:41] says, "And he was a man with like
[50:43] passions as us.
[50:45] He was a man that had faults, but Elijah
[50:48] prayed. Amen. I could go all night,
[50:51] brother.
[51:01] [Music]
[51:09] [Music]
[51:17] secret
[51:20] &gt;&gt; is it on a secret for the congregation?
[51:23] When we start singing, I turn my lapel
[51:25] microphone off and they turn this one on
[51:28] so I can stand back here and I can sing
[51:30] and you can't hear me.
[51:32] So, Sister Sharon, this is a song about
[51:34] David, the one that you said. This is a
[51:36] song about him praying.

[53:33] David
[53:34] shouts.
[53:37] When the spirit of the Lord comes upon
[53:42] my heart, I will shout like David
[53:47] shouts.
[53:50] Oh, I will shout.
[53:53] I will shout.
[53:56] I will shout like David
[54:00] shouts.
[54:03] I will shout.
[54:06] I will shout.
[54:09] I will shout like day. Let's sing verse
[54:13] one again.

[54:20] my heart, I will dance like David
[54:26] dance.
[54:29] When the spirit of the Lord comes upon

[54:58] I will dance.
[55:01] I will dance like David.
[55:08] When the spirit of the Lord comes upon
[55:12] my heart, I will pray like David
[55:18] pray.
[55:21] When the spirit of the Lord comes upon
[55:25] my heart, I will pray like David
[55:31] prayed.
[55:33] Oh, I will pray.
[55:37] I will pray.
[55:40] I will pray like David prayed.
[55:47] I will pray.
[55:50] I will pray.
[55:53] I will pray like David prayed.
[55:59] Brother Matt, would you come one more
[56:00] time? Would you come and close in
[56:02] prayer, please? One more time. I will
[56:03] pray like David prayed.
[56:06] I will pray.
[56:09] I will pray.
[56:12] I will pray like David prayed.
[56:19] I will pray.
[56:22] I will pray.
[56:25] I will pray like David
[56:29] pray.
[56:31] [Music]
[56:34] Okay, saints.
[56:37] Heavenly Father, what we learned about
[56:38] tonight is so very important, Father.
[56:42] I imagine if there's any regret when
[56:44] it's all said and done, it would be that
[56:47] we didn't pray more, Father. So, I pray
[56:49] that you help us, Lord. You said,
[56:51] "Forget not all our all your benefits,
[56:54] Lord." And how else do we access those?
[56:55] by but by getting before you and
[56:59] searching for your word, Lord, and and
[57:01] then asking for what you have already
[57:03] promised, Lord. And uh Father, would you
[57:06] help us as we move forward just to be
[57:09] more devoted, more dedicated, set aside
[57:11] more time, Lord?
[57:13] It will only benefit us, Lord, and we
[57:15] will only be encouraged and strengthened
[57:17] in you, Father. I pray also that you
[57:19] would protect our prayer time, Lord. We
[57:22] know that the enemy is most interested
[57:26] in in breaking up our prayer time, Lord.
[57:29] So I pray that you would send as you
[57:30] sent an angel, Father, to destroy
[57:32] Sinakareb, Lord, that you would send
[57:34] angels, Father, when these saints go to
[57:36] pray, oh God, would you come, Father,
[57:38] with angels and surround about their
[57:40] rooms, surround their prayer closets,
[57:42] Lord, and anoint their prayers, Father,
[57:44] for there are desperate needs on the
[57:46] people's hearts, Lord. And oh, how they
[57:48] need to seek you, Father, and they need
[57:50] protection, Lord. Oh, you can do it,
[57:52] Father. And with that in mind, Lord, we
[57:54] just ask that you would bless all of
[57:56] these saints. Bless the rest of our days
[57:58] this week in the in the Sunday service,
[58:00] Father, in the mighty matchless name of
[58:03] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise the Lord.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Wait upon the Lord shall renew the
[58:16] strength.
[58:18] They that wait
[58:21] upon the Lord
[58:24] shall renew
[58:27] their strength.
[58:30] They shall mount up with wings
[58:36] as eagles.
[58:41] They shall run
[58:43] and not be weery.
[58:46] They shall walk and not faint.
[58:52] Teach me Lord,
[58:54] teach me Lord
[58:57] to way.
[59:00] The first verse.
[59:02] Teach me Lord
[59:05] to way.
[59:09] down on
[59:11] my knees
[59:13] till in your own good time
[59:19] you answer
[59:22] my please.
[59:24] Teach me not
[59:27] to rely
[59:30] on what others
[59:33] do,
[59:35] but to wait
[59:38] in prayer for
[59:41] an answer
[59:43] from you.
[59:45] Oh, they that wait
[59:48] upon the Lord
[59:51] shall renew
[59:54] their strength.
[59:56] They shall mount up with wings
[1:00:02] as eagles.
[1:00:07] They shall run and not be weery.
[1:00:12] They shall walk
[1:00:15] and not faint.
[1:00:18] Teach me Lord.
[1:00:20] Teach me Lord
[1:00:23] to
[1:00:27] one.
[1:00:28] The same one
[1:00:31] that prayed with King Hezekiah when the
[1:00:34] enemy came against them is the same one.
[1:00:38] The same prophet that wrote this.
[1:00:41] He gives power to the faint. And to them
[1:00:45] that have no might, he increases
[1:00:48] strength. Even the youth shall faint and
[1:00:51] be weary, and the young men shall
[1:00:53] utterly fall. But they that wait upon
[1:00:56] the Lord shall renew their strength.
[1:00:59] They shall mount up with wings as
[1:01:01] eagles. They shall run and not be weary.
[1:01:05] They shall walk and not faint. The
[1:01:08] prophet Isaiah. One more time, brother.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; That wait
[1:01:14] upon the Lord
[1:01:17] shall renew
[1:01:20] their strength.
[1:01:23] They shall mount up with wings
[1:01:28] as eagles.
[1:01:33] They shall run
[1:01:36] and not be weary.
[1:01:39] They shall walk and unfree.
[1:01:44] Teach me, Lord.
[1:01:47] Teach me, Lord.
[1:01:49] [Music]
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Bless you, brothers and sisters. You're
[1:01:54] dismissed.
