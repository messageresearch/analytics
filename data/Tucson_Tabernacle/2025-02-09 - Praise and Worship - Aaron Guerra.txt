Come here Lord and be with us this evening in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray [Music] amen you can be seated I um brother Jordan do you have that email uh with the image on there that I sent yes brother Ricardo mentioned voice of God Recordings and all the work that's going on around the world um a few of you saw uh a few days ago an image on voice of God Recordings website quot the day and I thought you know what let's let's just share this with the whole group this is something sister hope you sent me a copy and I think a few others sent me a copy of this it's it's really neat so this is a advertisement of brother brandom at The Friendly Church look at the address that's a Tucson Tabernacle he preached from this very pulpit in this very building and uh this this was just a few days ago I think brother Lyle did you mention uh it was the anniversary of him preaching that I'm not I'm not sure brother Jordan did okay yeah put that back up there there there was two adver advertisements there this was originally Assemblies of God and uh it um I was just proud of it when uh when it came up and and the Breen and sister started sending it to me really nice yes behind this very this very Pulpit right here so anyways I thought uh I thought you'd enjoy seeing that and when I looked at the address I said yeah that's great I believe it was in was it in 1961 I believe and it was two sermons it was a Sunday morning and Sunday evening and uh brother brandom if if you know brother brandom and if you listen to a lot of his sermons you just you get to know his tone of voice and you get to know just his personality and you could see you could hear in his tone that brother Brandon was frustrated as he was ministering and he couldn't he couldn't get the people to respond and um he uh brother Aaron I'm sorry to put you on the spot can you give the test testimony better than I of what happened and just come on up here so it's on the microphone um so brother brandom as I said if you listen to the sermons it he uh couldn't get the people to respond and if you know him you know his tone of voice you can hear there's there's something a little bit off and then brother Aaron has the testimony of what happened after that service and then I will follow up with brother Aaron with something that brings it right to today I've shared this before but this little corner here of the church was an empty space and some of the Believers and sister Jessica's father brother Robert was just a young child here then but it was the figa family uh the gastellum family the Stell family they all had heard brother Brandon was going to be in in service they got here a little late and that was the only available spot so they were all there and brother brand was preaching here off behind this this physical pulpit and uh who was the brother that had the I forget his name brother had the um hardware store brother here in town brother stroy he and his wife shared with my father one day then brother Bram told him that the angel of the Lord was standing right behind him the congregation was not receiving what brother brandham was saying and the angel said it is for them they are receiving it and those families are still represented and then brother brandham when he preaches in Los Angeles he makes a comment along that line of what he had said God's saving power God will reach wherever he has to to get one of his own is that right yeah he just said where he was but God will get to you brother now let me let me bring it down home brother Ricardo you're gonna like this testimony so brother Aon mentioned the gastellum family the um and the different ones was the fryo family also yeah and it was it was a group of of Hispanic people and brother made the made the statement that it was for the Hispanic people that came in late which is now [Laughter] common and sat over here in this wing and I would like to say that we've baptized in this church well over 60 people in the past year or so and you've seen a lot of people start to fill up these these chairs in this church I almost said pews this these chairs in this in this church and most I'd say not I'd say a large majority of those people that have come come from those families that were there that came in late that sat up here in in the front over here and we see that something they they many of them left and have been gone for decades but there is something drawing those people back and we have seen it here at the Tucson Tabernacle we have seen it with our own eyes many of these people coming back Amen brother Manny there's one of them right here he married one of them and my sister here praise God do it feel good raise your hand here's one of the fulfillments of that yes God bless you brothers and sisters so tonight the um the plan is we're going to sing we're going to praise and uh then we're going to baptize how does that sound all right God bless you sing I am redeemed sister hope if you want to come get ready I am redeemed bought away the price Jesus has changed my whole life if anybody ask you just who I am tell them I am [Music] redeemed where there was hate love now abounds where there was confusion peace now R I'm walking with Jesus I'm a child of the king and it's all because I am redeemed oh I am redeemed I'm bought with a prize Jesus changed my whole life if anybody asks you just who I am tell them I am redeem second verse I like this I'll tell of his favor I'll tell of his love and I'll tell of his goodness to me he purchased my Redemption with his own precious blood and from sin he set me free oh I am redeemed I'm bought with the price Jesus has changed my whole life if anybody ask ask you just who I am tell them I am redeemed sister hope isn't that wonderful there's so much gossip next time somebody wants you to talk about someone else just tell them that person is redeemed if anybody's trying to hear the gossip just say that person's Redeemed by his Precious Blood sister you may be down and feel like God has somehow forgotten that you are faced with circumstances you can't get [Music] through and now there seems that

song uh two years ago February 8th I was on my way to the dunes to meet up with some people um Jason Christine Wallace some of the Dalton family for a weekend of uh fellowship and uh some fun um on this song I'll Praise You In The Storm [Music] sometimes I get a song on my heart and I just know I need to sing it for somebody I don't know who it's for but it comes on so strong that you know that's the next song You're supposed to sing when I was driving I was going down I 10 and brother Dan probably knows this area headed towards Yuma right about where inter 8 comes off of I 10 I was singing this song I'm Lord I'm not in a storm right now so who is this [Music] for it's like I just came out of a storm but Lord I'm not in a storm right now but I know you want me to sing this so Lord I'll keep practicing it and we'll uh it'll be the next song I sing We the next day February 9th today we spent the day running around in the dunes having fun on our way back to the camp and about this time of the evening I tipped my machine over stuck my arm out as it went over and it landed on my arm and uh sister can put up the [Music] picture that was the result and then the next day there's one more picture the next day I ended up with surgery and that was what we ended up with um one of the bones didn't heal and 6 months later I had to have another surgery bone graft and redo one of the plates but right after it happened the uh the pain was intense but got my arm out from under the machine and I was like Lord right away it was just like thank you Lord here we go this is going to be a journey but Lord I know you're with me and thank you I don't understand but thank you the next day the 10th I had surgery and in the hospital after I came out of surgery this song was still going through my [Music] head and the lines are as your mercy falls I raise my hands and praise the God who gives and takes away and I'll praise you in the storm so I found out who the you know who the song was for but through it all it was a year-long ordeal I was on light duty um my work was very gracious to work with me and uh help me where they could but he's faithful and no matter what you go through Just Praise You always praise him in the storm and uh I kept looking at the date and like I think I should sing that song again and just testify of the goodness of God and praise him in every storm that I go through [Music] I was sure by now God you wouldn't have reached down and wi tears away stepped in and save the day but once again I say amen and it's still [Music] raining and As The Thunder Rolls I barely hear you whisper through the rain I'm with you and as your mercy falls I raise my hands and praise the God who gives and takes away so I'll Praise You In This Storm I will lift my hands for you are who you are no matter where I am every tear I cry you hold in your hands you never left my side and though my heart is tor I'll Praise You In This [Music] Storm I remember when I stumbled in the wind you heard my cry and you raised me up again my strength is almost gone how can I carry on if I can't find you and As The Thunder Rolls I barely hear you whispered through the rain I'm with you and as your mercy falls I raise my hands and praise The God Who giv and takes away so I'll Praise You In This Storm I will lift my hands for you are who you are no matter where I am every tear I've cried you hold in your hands you never left my side and though my heart is tor I'll Praise You In This [Music] Stone I lift my eyes into the hills where does my help come from my help comes from the Lord the make of Heaven and Earth I lift my eyes into the hills where does my help come from my help comes from the Lord the maker of heaven and [Music] Earth so I'll Praise You In This Storm I will lift my hands for you are who you are no matter where I am every tear I cry you hold in your hands you never left my side and though my heart is [Music] torn I'll Praise You In This Storm and know my heart is torn I'll Praise You In This Storm and know my heart is torn I'll Praise You In This Storm isn't it wonderful to see the mind of the Lord for a service like this sister Hope's song he'll do it again and there's some lines in there that say he's the god of the sun the Stars the sea he is your father he'll calm the storm he'll find a way he'll fix it for you you may

good to see you welcome in light of baptism tonight I want to say a few words and then I'd like to have brother brandham also say a few words on this subject of baptism it was a time that the Lord Jesus had promised that he was going to fill his disciples they didn't know what was going to happen they they just know that that he said to wait in this place until you are endued with power from on high they didn't know what power from on high I was they probably had a lot of ideas but when it finally happened in the upper room and they came out from that room and they were stumbling like drunk people and they were speaking in in unknown tongues and the people saw them and they they said what is what is this going on these men are full of new wine and Peter now filled with the holy spirit says this for these men for these are not drunken as you suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel and it shall come to pass in the last days saith God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams I'm in Acts chapter 2 and then Peter goes on to preach this beautiful sermon sermon bringing Jesus Christ out of the scriptures and showing his presence and showing his calling and showing his deity to the people and the people were so touched as they heard Peter's words Acts chapter [Music] 2 verse 32 Peter says this this Jesus hath God raised up whereof we are all Witnesses therefore being by the right hand of God exalted in having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost he has shed forth this which ye now know and hear for David is not ascended into the heavens but he saith himself the Lord saith unto my Lord sit thou on my right hand until I make thy foes thy foot stools therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom you have crucified both Lord and Christ now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart they were cut in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we we do imagine that the same spirit that was working on those people way back 2,000 years ago and they went to Peter is the Same Spirit working on these children this evening the same feeling that they had is the same feeling that these kids are having Lord what do I need to do thank God that there is an answer then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for This Promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this UNT generation then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added under them about 3,000 Souls I love it thinking the same spirit that was working on those people there at the day of Pentecost is the Same Spirit that's working on our children and I picked out just a beautiful quote to um to play [Music] tonight it's from future home of heavenly bridegroom and Earthly bride but but before I I get there while I was looking I came across this one and it blessed me so much really explains very well water baptism in just a few words brother Bram says this now we believe in water baptism in the brandham Tabernacle by immersing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we believe that in the Tucson Tabernacle too which is the apostolic teaching of the Bible and may all may all members of us or comers to the brandom Tabernacle who desire such may it any time requesting to be immersed in the name of the Lord Jesus may he consult the pastor if they have repented and Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ the pastor will as soon as possible even that it then if he can baptize them immediately this does bring them into the Fellowship of the Believers we believe that by water baptism we are brought into a fellowship but by the baptism of the Holy Spirit we are brought into the into the members being members of the body of Jesus Christ which is all over the world oh that's beautiful beautiful I'll have you be seated the following quote the following portion of the sermon we're going to hear comes from the sermon titled the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride it starts with paragraph 81 if you'd like to follow brother Jordan thank you now first stage that he brings us to see his Plan of Redemption is exact the Same by everything he uses the same method he never changes he said in Malachi 3 I am God and I change not the way he does it therefore if he saved the first man he ever saved by the shed blood of an innocent one he'll have to save the next one and every one he saves will have to be the same way if he healed a man at any time through the Journey of life let it be in the days of Jesus the apostles the prophets whatever it was when the same conditions is met he's got to do it again that's right he doesn't change man changes time changes age changes dispensation changes but God Remains the Same it's perfect what I hope that hard give the sick people if he ever healed a person he has to do it again when the same conditions is met he ever ever saved a man he's got to do it on the same ground as he did it the first time if he ever filled a man with the Holy Ghost he's got to do it on the same grounds he did the first time if he ever raised a man up from the grave he's got to do it the second time and every other time on the same principle doesn't change oh what a hope that gives me what is it not in some man-made Theory something that groups a man have come together but his unchangeable word you say is it the truth he said let every man's word be a lie and mine be true for heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail all scriptures given by inspiration therefore it's good and profitable for Doctrine and remember that all scripture will be fulfilled every a bit of it notice how God God makes it plain to us and if that wasn't a a great confirmation a good a great loving blessing from God when I see this and see that since a boy first time ever Christ dealt with me I've still always taught those three stages of Grace notice it isn't true now now the first step is repentance towards God and then follows after that is water baptism water baptism repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ see water baptism follows showing that repentance was genuine or to remit our past sins now it has nothing to do with future sin it only remits repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ what far remission taken away of past sin has nothing to do with the future just your uh sin has been chopped off what you did you can't repent from what Adam done you never done it Adam did you just get forgiveness for what You' done the old nature still there let me take this board just a minute now here is a human heart I'm not I'm a long way since been an artist here is a human heart and here is a human heart now this one over here has a snake in it that's sin here he has his life this over here has a dove in it which is the holy spirit here he has a life well this here has malice hatred Envy that's what's causing this all here amen well this over here has love and uh joy and longsuffering and that's what does it down here now when you are asked or you are forgiven of your sins you've only done this taking that away but the thing that made you do it is still there that's the old root of evil it's still there notice then you repent and are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that he forgave you of your sins notice then secondly comes sanctification which sets our mind in order for Holiness to think right amen taken away sanctification is a compound Greek word which means cleaned and set aside for service then the next comes the baptism of the fire and holy ghost that God might dwell in us and the fire of God cleanses our hearts from sin and puts the Holy Ghost Inside then we bring forth the same life that this did because that's us notice in the natural birth when a woman gives birth to a baby the Natural Life types the spiritual life when a woman gives birth to a baby the natural the first thing happens is breaking of water then blood and then the Spirit Alive grab the little fell and spank him and away he go screaming water blood spirit and now when a baby is born into the kingdom of God he comes the same water blood spirit I notice sanctification the third stage second stage of it cleanses the Mind sets the heart the mind of the heart in order of Holiness a man can repent of sins and he's still thinking of well maybe he's a immoral man every immoral looking woman he finds is still there maybe he's a drunker every time he smells the drink it's still there see but then when he gets Sanctified that cleanses that desire out of him see it takes the want of it away he can still be tempted but he takes the want of it away still he's not right yet then he is baptized with the Holy Ghost in fire cleansed burned out cleaned up and then put into the service of God sanctification only sets him aside for service and notice this exactly how that come the message is coming Martin Luther justification John Wesley sanctification the Pentecostal the baptism of the Holy Ghost the messages that's where there can't be any more ages of it see we're at the end time three stages baptism cleanses the heart with the Holy Ghost how striking now he takes the place where we are to dwell in through the same process now he's called The Church through justification called it through sanctification then filled it with the Holy Ghost and Fire and he took it through a process that he himself the Holy Spirit himself the Son of God could dwell in the human heart now it has to go through that before he can come into it amen I say that's a good explanation of what baptism is what do you think amen so important brother brandom said there must be a repentance first that's why we don't baptize babies because there's no repentance in a baby a baby's never done anything wrong I assume Asher and Khloe have done a few things wrong God bless you it's uh it's an honor but that those things right there their first is a repentance and then there's a there's as the Bible says that they're pricked in their heart and um uh sister Abby was telling me the testimony of how that that it it came along and how they've stuck with this and they really want to do it and if brother Aaron if you could make ready and and bring bring them upstairs it shows that God is still god brother Bram said God changes not he still works on the heart of the people he works on the heart of the children he works on the heart of a adults he works on the heart of new converts and he's still working and it's it's beautiful because when that either the the young child like this when he or she gives their heart to the Lord the first thing they want to do is they want to be baptized and it shows that the parents have in been instilling these in these things into the kids and teaching them right and then they have that desire and then they go into the Waters of baptism and then that's just the beginning brother brandom just said he said for it's it's the remission of your past sins and now those sins have been remitted now you move forward as a new creature as As Romans I believe it's chapter 6 says you go forward as a new person those old sins washed away and now moving forward and I look forward to seeing these these kids and how that they will grow up in the Lord and I believe that they will be Servants of God and it'll just get better and better it get hard is it's just life he didn't say that our that we won't ever sin again but we do we we have a journey and they're taking this Step In the Journey and moving forward and being baptized and it's it's a beautiful thing Amen brother Josiah I'm going to turn the service over to you as brother Aon and and the kids prepare for baptism and I'll uh I'll sit in the front and I'll keep an eye out for you Jesus our [Music] saor came to Earth one day he was born in a [Music] stable in a Manger of ha though he rejected [Music] but not from above God gave us his son on the wings of a dove on the wings of a snow white dove God sends his pure Sweet Love A Sign from above on the wings of a dove and though I have suffered in many a ways I've cried for healing both night and day Faith wasn't for God de by the father above he gave me his side on the wings of a dove oh on the wings of a snow white dove God sends his pure Sweet Love A Sign from above on the wings of a dove oh Noah had drifted on the floods many days he searched for land in various ways troubles he had some but not from above for God gave him that [Music] sign on the wings of a d oh on the wings of a snow white D God sends his pure Sweet Love A Sign from above on the wings of a dove let's sing that last verse now the prophet had left us but he showed us the way said look unto Jesus from day to day for Jesus has promised from the depths of his love he'll send us his sign on the wings of a dove oh on the wings of a snow white do God sends his pure Sweet Love A Sign from above [Laughter] on the wings of a dove key of G giving my life away as there coming out now I'm giving my life [Music] away laying it down on the altar now I'm giving my life oh way the very least I can offer is my y so here I stand today giving my life away [Music] sure is a privilege to be up here something I thought I may never see but here we are I remember the first baptismal service that I witnessed here at the Tabernacle was in 1977 that year and everybody had said that Jesus was coming then so about 135 of us got baptized that night rebaptism to everybody making sure it was ready and here it is just a few years down the road wouldn't thought we've gotten this far but here we are today now to baptize my my grandson and I know he loves the Lord Jesus mommy asked him he said about getting baptized and he said what is it when you get baptized she goes it means you're going to worship Jesus and worship gets to give praise and honor and who more deserves it so this is Asher and he'll be seven on Tuesday and so we're going to baptize him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ e [Applause] than so when Abby was talking to the kids because they had mentioned about being baptized Asher had wanted to take communion so that's when Abby began to tell them the you know the process if I could say it that way and so she was talking to them and Abby asked Chloe have you given your heart to the Lord and Khloe said no she says you want to do that and she says yes so she goes you want to pray and she goes yeah so Abby said I was going to go with her but she says Mama I'll go by myself I'll go to my room so she was in her room for a little while and when she came out she had a smile on her face and she said I gave my heart to the Lord and she says now I want to be baptized so it it's such an honor I was going toti you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and God said he would you his Holy Spirit and that's what's going to help you be a Christian Ser bapes you in name of the Jesus [Applause] Christ I've seen a vis harsh and sweet oh the one who gave all he had for me I've seen the passion of his death and the Forgiveness of his final breath and now I can never be the same for my heart has been and forever changed I've got to live and love and give the way he [Music] gave and now I'm giving my life away laying it down on the altar now I'm giving my life away the very least I can offer is my own so here I stand [Music] today giving my life life away no earthly price and no earthly price could be too great and no sacrifice too much to make no way of measuring the cost next to the blood of calvary's cross so if I live I live for him or if I die I count it again my life is not my own but his from this day on and now I'm giving my life away laying it down on the altar now I am giving my life [Music] away the very least I can offer is my own oh so here I stand [Music] today giving
