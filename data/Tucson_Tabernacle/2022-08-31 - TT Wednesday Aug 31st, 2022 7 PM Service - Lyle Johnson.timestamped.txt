[31:32] my lord
[31:36] speak and i will answer
[31:40] lord send me
[31:45] thank you
[31:47] is that your heart tonight
[31:49] that the lord would speak
[31:51] and whatever he says for you to do that
[31:53] you'd say lord i want to do that i want
[31:55] to do that for you
[31:57] speak lord
[31:59] and i'll be quick to answer you
[32:02] i'm happy to be here tonight
[32:04] and a bit nervous
[32:06] not nervous because of you but because
[32:08] we have a great responsibility
[32:11] together
[32:12] me to
[32:13] seek to be careful to say what the lord
[32:15] once said
[32:18] and you to hear in the spirit
[32:20] what he has for you to hear regardless
[32:23] of my flaws and mistakes
[32:26] paul tells us in ephesians 2 8 that
[32:28] faith is a gift
[32:31] and in romans 10 17 he tells us that it
[32:33] comes by hearing
[32:35] the word of god
[32:37] as the disciples implored jesus in luke
[32:40] 17 5
[32:41] increase our faith
[32:43] so we desired that the lord would help
[32:45] us to speak and hear this evening in a
[32:48] way
[32:49] that would increase our faith
[32:52] brother matt watkins spoke here recently
[32:55] using is an example from brother branham
[32:57] contrasting the cockle bird
[32:59] that that that old nature of ours that
[33:02] prickly nature and the wheat germ the
[33:05] seed of god
[33:06] planted within us it's just an
[33:08] illustration of course but it helps us
[33:10] understand the ongoing conflict
[33:13] within our lives
[33:14] as we fight to conform to the spirit's
[33:17] desire while we're struggling with and
[33:20] in our flesh
[33:21] battling our own sinful nature striving
[33:24] to seek and do
[33:27] his will
[33:28] we can say like the man in mark 9 24
[33:32] whose
[33:32] son was possessed of a demon who cried
[33:35] out with tears the bible tells us lord
[33:39] i believe
[33:40] help thou
[33:42] my unbelief
[33:43] i wonder if we could stand together
[33:46] before we read the word
[33:48] and approach the author
[33:53] lord jesus
[33:55] we're honored
[33:56] and humbled
[33:57] to be together
[33:59] with believers of light precious faith
[34:02] lord gathered here of our free will
[34:05] to honor you to worship you to praise
[34:08] you to hear from you to reach out to
[34:11] draw
[34:12] lord i pray that as you're here this
[34:15] evening lord that you'd meet the needs
[34:16] in each heart
[34:18] lord i i don't want to just stand up
[34:20] here and push play and say get me out of
[34:22] the way and speak but lord it's not
[34:24] pushing play it's the desire of my heart
[34:28] lord that i would be out of the way lord
[34:30] that you could speak to your people that
[34:32] are gathered here tonight lord
[34:34] because they're your people you purchase
[34:37] them at great cost
[34:39] lord jesus we thank you for your
[34:41] presence for your love your mercy and
[34:43] your grace and pray that you be with us
[34:45] now this evening as we commit the
[34:47] remainder of this service again into
[34:49] your hands in jesus name we ask
[34:52] amen
[34:59] the topic i have on my heart this
[35:01] evening is what we often call the great
[35:03] commission
[35:05] it's found in the gospels of matthew
[35:07] mark and luke
[35:09] and in the first part of acts also
[35:12] written by luke
[35:14] they're instructions that jesus gave
[35:17] after his resurrection
[35:19] and prior to his ascent i i want to read
[35:22] these together as as one account before
[35:24] we're seated
[35:26] in luke 24 and verse 46 we read
[35:30] and jesus said unto them
[35:33] who's them
[35:35] his disciples
[35:37] what's a disciple
[35:39] well we're going to talk about that this
[35:41] evening
[35:42] thus it is written and thus it behooved
[35:45] that means it was needful it was
[35:47] necessary for christ to suffer
[35:50] and to rise from the dead the third day
[35:53] and that repentance and remission of
[35:56] sins should be preached in his name
[36:00] among all nations
[36:02] beginning
[36:03] at jerusalem
[36:06] that that first part of verse 47 that's
[36:09] exactly
[36:11] what we read about
[36:13] in peter's famous sermon in acts 2.
[36:16] faithful jewish people from among all
[36:18] the nations
[36:19] were gathered in jerusalem
[36:22] and peter's very first message
[36:24] was one of repentance
[36:26] and remission of sins
[36:29] jesus goes on to say ye are witnesses of
[36:32] these things of christ's suffering and
[36:34] resurrection
[36:36] and he says and behold in other words
[36:38] listen closely now
[36:41] i
[36:42] who
[36:44] jesus
[36:45] i send the promise of my father upon you
[36:49] but tarry ye
[36:51] remain
[36:52] and wait
[36:53] in the city of jerusalem until
[36:56] you be endued with power from on high
[37:00] then get up and stop waiting
[37:02] this cherrying is not to be your
[37:04] permanent state it's not to be your goal
[37:09] in acts
[37:10] one starting at verse four and
[37:14] the resurrected jesus being assembled
[37:16] together with them the eleven disciples
[37:18] and others
[37:20] commanded the assembled group that they
[37:22] should not depart from jerusalem but
[37:24] wait for the promise of the father which
[37:27] saith you've heard of me
[37:29] of jesus
[37:31] for john truly baptized with water but
[37:33] ye
[37:35] who
[37:36] the disciples and others gathered with
[37:38] them you shall be baptized with
[37:41] completely immersed into
[37:43] the holy ghost not many days hence
[37:47] it's coming
[37:48] skipping down to verse 8 jesus continues
[37:50] but ye shall receive a comfortable
[37:53] living oh no
[37:55] peace and safety from rome
[37:58] no
[37:59] ye shall receive power
[38:02] after that the holy ghost has come upon
[38:04] you
[38:05] this is that power from on high with
[38:07] which you'll be endued the promise of
[38:09] the father sent by jesus
[38:11] and why
[38:13] for what purpose do they need that power
[38:16] from the holy spirit
[38:18] why is god going to all the trouble to
[38:20] play out this plan
[38:23] here's the reason
[38:24] ye shall be witnesses unto me
[38:27] about me
[38:28] of mine both in jerusalem and in all
[38:31] judea
[38:32] and in samaria
[38:35] and unto the uttermost part of the earth
[38:38] everywhere
[38:39] and in mark 16 and matthew 28
[38:44] putting those together
[38:46] and jesus said unto them
[38:49] go ye therefore into all the world
[38:53] preach the gospel to every creature
[38:55] and teach all nations
[38:58] baptizing them in the name of the father
[39:00] and of the son and of the holy ghost
[39:01] which we know that name is the lord
[39:03] jesus christ
[39:05] teaching them
[39:07] to observe all things
[39:10] how many things are they supposed to
[39:11] observe
[39:13] oh
[39:14] how many do we get to skip or gloss over
[39:16] or not like and not do
[39:19] none
[39:20] all things whatsoever i have commanded
[39:23] you
[39:25] anyone here have a list of all jesus
[39:27] commands recorded in the gospels apart
[39:30] from holding up your bible amy oh i
[39:32] don't either but i'm working on it
[39:35] and lo he says i'm with you always even
[39:37] to the end of the world
[39:39] amen that ends matthew's account mark
[39:43] goes on a bit further he says he that
[39:45] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[39:48] he that believeth not
[39:50] shall be condemned
[39:52] these signs shall follow them that
[39:54] believe my name shall they cast out
[39:56] devils speak with new tongues take up
[39:59] serpents if they drink any deadly thing
[40:01] it won't hurt them
[40:03] they shall lay hands on the sick
[40:05] and they shall recover
[40:09] please be seated
[40:13] ye are witnesses
[40:15] jesus said to his disciples
[40:17] but you also shall be
[40:20] by witnesses
[40:22] does that remind you little brother
[40:24] green
[40:25] acts 4 20 i cannot but speak those
[40:27] things which i've seen and heard
[40:29] when he came to our house the first time
[40:31] we used to have people guests right on
[40:33] our table cloth and he wrote large
[40:34] letters perry green acts 4
[40:36] 20.
[40:38] what does it mean
[40:40] to be a witness
[40:42] to give your testimony as in a court
[40:44] telling of your personal experience with
[40:46] christ
[40:48] how you got your fire lit
[40:51] we're told in revelation 12 11 that they
[40:55] the believers at the end time overcame
[40:58] him
[40:59] who
[41:00] satan
[41:02] how
[41:03] firstly by the blood of the lamb
[41:07] and secondly by the word of their
[41:10] testimony
[41:12] and thirdly
[41:13] their attitude was that they loved out
[41:15] their lives unto the death
[41:18] so certainly our testimony
[41:20] is very important it's a very powerful
[41:22] part of this great commission
[41:25] but
[41:26] what is that great commission really
[41:30] we recall brother branham relating an
[41:32] incident in the life of billy graham
[41:35] i'll just paraphrase it
[41:37] at a breakfast in louisville kentucky
[41:39] reverend graham lodged a complaint with
[41:41] the gathered ministers
[41:43] he said he'd go into a city and have
[41:45] tens of thousands of converts people who
[41:47] made decisions to follow christ
[41:50] he'd return months later and
[41:53] could hardly find any
[41:55] he noted that in paul's day the opposite
[41:58] happened
[41:59] reverend graham scolded what he called
[42:01] the lazy preachers with their feet on
[42:03] their desks for not going out and
[42:05] following up with the people
[42:08] brother branham commented that
[42:10] the real problem
[42:12] was in those meetings billy graham had
[42:14] not taken people beyond a decision
[42:16] raising their hand coming forward and so
[42:19] forth
[42:20] paul on the other hand had taken them
[42:21] all the way to being baptized and filled
[42:24] with the holy spirit
[42:27] but
[42:28] in fairness we hear the recordings of
[42:30] many of brother branham's meetings
[42:32] looking at the dates
[42:33] we realize that brother branham often
[42:35] did the very thing
[42:37] call people to raise their hands
[42:39] accept the lord as their personal savior
[42:42] and
[42:43] within a couple of days he was in
[42:44] another town reaching out and preaching
[42:46] again
[42:48] he didn't or at least rarely stayed with
[42:50] all of those who raised their hands and
[42:52] prayed and stayed with them until they
[42:54] received the full baptism of the holy
[42:55] spirit
[42:57] but that's how evangelistic campaigns
[42:59] were held in the late 40s through the
[43:01] 1960s
[43:07] i was in such evangelistic meetings
[43:09] including giant tet meetings as a child
[43:12] i remember going forward in a billy
[43:14] graham crusade at the cow palace in san
[43:16] francisco in the late spring of 1958.
[43:20] that incredibly cute little kid in the
[43:22] corner that's me at age eight right
[43:25] but oh billy graham that's him at age 39
[43:28] okay but i went forward but not for the
[43:31] right reason
[43:32] i saw both of my big brothers go forward
[43:34] that evening my oldest brother paul at
[43:37] age 16
[43:38] my brother noel at age 13 they were
[43:41] responding
[43:43] but i the eight-year-old baby of the
[43:45] family wanted to go with them to do what
[43:48] they did
[43:50] now we know that there is what we call
[43:53] the five-fold ministry
[43:55] really it's just a way of saying that
[43:56] there are many parts
[43:58] to ministry
[44:00] one part is evangelism what brother
[44:03] branham mostly did especially in the
[44:04] early years what billy graham always did
[44:08] introducing people to jesus christ
[44:10] preaching
[44:11] declaring
[44:13] there's also teaching
[44:15] which brother branham did more of in his
[44:17] later ministry especially at his home
[44:19] church
[44:20] going into depth at the evangelist
[44:23] plants
[44:24] the teacher waters
[44:26] paul goes into this in first corinthians
[44:28] the third chapters using himself and a
[44:31] man named apollos as examples first
[44:34] corinthians 3 6 we read paul says i have
[44:36] planted
[44:38] i was the evangelist i planted apollos
[44:41] watered
[44:42] he was a teacher
[44:44] but god
[44:45] gave the increase
[44:47] so then neither is he that planteth
[44:49] anything neither he that watereth it
[44:51] isn't about us
[44:53] but god
[44:54] that giveth the increase
[44:57] it's all about him
[44:59] now he that plants and he that waters
[45:01] are one every man shall receive his own
[45:03] reward according to his own labor for we
[45:06] are laborers he says together with god
[45:11] not just in
[45:12] but with
[45:15] well
[45:16] other parts of ministry include
[45:17] pastoring
[45:19] shepherding helping people deal with the
[45:21] problems of real life as they go through
[45:23] life
[45:24] being a counselor
[45:26] there are apostles
[45:28] what we call missionaries people who go
[45:31] someplace and stay long enough
[45:33] to do what brother branham was referring
[45:35] to in the incident i mentioned with
[45:37] billy graham
[45:39] the work of the apostle of course is
[45:40] different than the work of the
[45:42] evangelist
[45:44] there's the prophet not just the way
[45:46] that we look upon brother branham is
[45:48] bringing us revelation but like the ones
[45:50] you read about in acts like agabus
[45:52] prophesying to paul that if you keep
[45:54] going this way you go to jerusalem
[45:56] you're going to wind up in prison
[45:58] brother
[46:00] in much of his early ministry
[46:02] brother branham was doing the work of an
[46:04] evangelist similar to billy graham
[46:06] exposing people to the gospel
[46:08] encouraging them to turn to christ
[46:11] handing them off to others for
[46:13] instruction and growth
[46:16] paul on the other hand
[46:18] was often
[46:20] doing the work of an apostle
[46:22] a missionary
[46:24] staying with a community of believers
[46:26] for weeks months
[46:28] sometimes even years
[46:30] until they were filled with the holy
[46:32] spirit
[46:33] teaching them their scriptures getting
[46:35] them grounded understanding what it
[46:37] means to be a christian
[46:39] answering their questions
[46:41] helping them overcome their backgrounds
[46:43] usually pagan and filled with hedonistic
[46:46] practices
[46:48] after he left
[46:50] we see him maintaining contact with him
[46:52] as we read in his epistles either by
[46:54] writing or sending others or going back
[46:57] himself
[47:00] my parents-in-law
[47:02] heather's dad and mom ted and millie
[47:04] ware
[47:05] were missionaries
[47:07] not travelers that go someplace for a
[47:10] few days or weeks and come home and call
[47:11] themselves missionaries
[47:13] not part of or supported by any
[47:16] denomination
[47:17] not sent out with a guaranteed or even
[47:19] committed level of financial support
[47:21] from some large congregation
[47:24] just going out
[47:26] because that is what they believe the
[47:28] lord called them to do
[47:30] the wares went and stayed for years
[47:33] cuba
[47:35] spain
[47:36] even tucson
[47:38] when they went to cuba with their five
[47:40] small children they didn't even speak
[47:42] spanish
[47:44] they learned the language as they spread
[47:46] the gospel in a country where few spoke
[47:48] english
[47:50] yet out of the work of her dad and mom
[47:52] and others who worked with them
[47:54] there is today an independent
[47:56] cuban-based pentecostal church movement
[47:58] that i've been told is the largest
[48:00] independent christian movement in cuba
[48:01] today
[48:02] some 64 years after they were forced to
[48:05] leave in the midst of the revolution
[48:07] under fidel castro
[48:09] they had stayed
[48:10] and planted
[48:12] and cultivated
[48:13] and the seeds they planted continued to
[48:15] bear fruit two and three generations
[48:17] later
[48:19] you can read that story in the book i'm
[48:20] displaying on the screen or a website of
[48:23] the same name with the love.com it's
[48:25] free i'm not selling anything
[48:28] there's nothing for sale on the website
[48:30] there's no gimmicks
[48:32] just a solid testimony
[48:36] tonight
[48:37] i want to take a closer look
[48:40] at what we call the great commission
[48:43] we'll even delve into some translations
[48:45] other than the king james to help us
[48:47] understand what jesus was saying to his
[48:49] team
[48:50] before he ascended
[48:53] but let's start
[48:55] by asking a couple of questions
[49:01] are we to witness
[49:03] in order to win converts
[49:06] or are we to teach
[49:08] in order to make disciples
[49:11] or both
[49:13] are those two sides of the same coin
[49:16] two ways
[49:17] to say the same thing
[49:20] do we all have identical roles
[49:23] in this commission
[49:25] and what is a disciple anyway
[49:29] as we read in luke
[49:31] jesus told his followers to wait in
[49:33] jerusalem until they would be endued
[49:36] filled
[49:37] provided with power from on high
[49:41] now the verse just before the great
[49:43] commission in matthew's account
[49:45] i find to be striking
[49:47] jesus came and spoke unto them saying
[49:50] all power is given unto me
[49:53] in heaven
[49:54] and in earth
[49:59] jesus said all power was given unto him
[50:05] then he told them to wait until he gave
[50:07] them a measure of that power
[50:10] which in one verse we read he called the
[50:11] promise of the father
[50:13] and in acts he described the purpose of
[50:16] that power
[50:17] that he was going to share with them
[50:21] the king james version but she shall
[50:24] there's no maybe here
[50:27] there's no perhaps
[50:29] it's unequivocal you shall receive power
[50:33] who's the source of that power
[50:36] we just read it
[50:37] to whom all power was given jesus
[50:41] you shall receive power after that the
[50:43] holy ghost has come upon you
[50:46] and ye shall be witnesses unto me
[50:49] both in jerusalem and in all judea
[50:52] and samaria
[50:53] to the outermost part of the earth
[50:57] so we ask ourselves what did jesus mean
[51:00] to be a witness unto me
[51:03] that were to tell jesus about something
[51:05] to witness to jesus
[51:08] let's look at another translation this
[51:10] is from the complete jewish bible
[51:14] but you will
[51:15] again there's no doubt you will receive
[51:18] power when the ruach hakodesh that
[51:21] literally that's the hebrew it means the
[51:23] wind the exhalation the breath of the
[51:26] holy
[51:27] comes upon you
[51:29] you will be my witnesses both in
[51:31] yerushalayim jerusalem
[51:33] and in all yahudah judea and shamrone
[51:37] samaria
[51:38] indeed to the ends of the earth
[51:41] the new american standard bible reads
[51:43] you'll receive power
[51:44] ability efficiency
[51:47] might when the holy spirit has come upon
[51:49] you you shall be my witnesses both in
[51:51] jerusalem and in all judea
[51:54] samaria
[51:55] as far as the remotest part of the earth
[51:59] so we are to be empowered by jesus
[52:03] witnesses of jesus
[52:06] to other people
[52:09] well what is this empowered witness
[52:12] let's turn back to matthew's gospel
[52:15] 28 19 go ye therefore
[52:21] and teach
[52:22] all nations
[52:25] all nations
[52:26] this is for everyone
[52:28] all races
[52:30] all kindreds
[52:31] all tongues
[52:33] all people everywhere
[52:35] it's not a jewish thing restricted to
[52:37] the descendants of jacob
[52:40] and not just witnesses of jesus but we
[52:44] collectively remember we each have a
[52:46] unique role to fill in god's plan but
[52:49] together
[52:50] we are to teach
[52:53] those we contact
[52:56] teach them what
[52:58] the next first teaching them to observe
[53:01] all things whatsoever i have commanded
[53:04] you
[53:06] what
[53:09] i thought it was all about grace
[53:11] you mean we have to observe things
[53:14] there's actually things we have to do
[53:17] teach things
[53:19] be an example to others of these things
[53:23] teach
[53:25] if you go into a classroom a public
[53:28] school
[53:28] a university
[53:30] the place where you might be
[53:31] homeschooling what do you see
[53:34] a teacher
[53:36] professor
[53:37] instructor
[53:39] and one or more students the teacher's
[53:42] job
[53:44] is to provide knowledge in a way that
[53:46] the students can comprehend
[53:49] the student's job
[53:51] is to pay attention
[53:53] to study the material
[53:55] to drill on it
[53:57] practice on it
[54:00] and be tested on it
[54:03] now
[54:04] if you want to learn calculus
[54:06] or even if you don't want to learn
[54:07] calculus you need algebra
[54:11] then trigonometry
[54:13] once you sufficiently mastered algebra
[54:16] and trig and demonstrated that you've
[54:19] mastered them
[54:20] then and only then
[54:22] can you move on to calculus
[54:25] and then you realize that calculus isn't
[54:27] the end it's only the beginning of
[54:28] higher math
[54:30] there's an order to things
[54:35] as we discussed a few meetings ago the
[54:38] first step in becoming a christian
[54:40] experiencing the new birth
[54:43] is repentance
[54:45] not baptism not being a witness
[54:48] but repenting
[54:50] godly sorrow a sincere and heartfelt
[54:53] recognition of sin in one's life
[54:57] and
[54:58] a strong desire to change
[55:01] it's the same as a step one in the
[55:03] alcoholics anonymous 12-step program to
[55:06] recover from alcoholism
[55:08] one must first look in the mirror
[55:11] and see an alcoholic
[55:13] not excuses
[55:16] heather often tells
[55:18] of requesting prayer from brother red
[55:20] cyril for something she was struggling
[55:22] with early in our marriage
[55:24] we were in new zealand for the first
[55:26] time back in 1972.
[55:30] brother searle's response to her when
[55:32] she asked him for prayer
[55:34] was this
[55:36] i'll pray for you
[55:38] but there are four things you must agree
[55:40] to
[55:41] before i'll do that
[55:44] one
[55:45] recognize you have a problem
[55:48] realize it
[55:50] confess it
[55:52] two
[55:54] genuinely desire to be free from that
[55:56] problem
[55:58] no longer want it
[56:03] ask the lord to deliver you from it
[56:07] you
[56:08] have to pray
[56:11] fourth
[56:12] thank the lord for doing it
[56:15] he said if you'd agree to do this then
[56:18] he'd be willing to listen
[56:20] as you confess the problem and your
[56:22] desire to be rid of it
[56:24] and he'd
[56:25] pray with you as you pray for
[56:28] deliverance and he'd join you in
[56:31] thanking the lord for answering that
[56:33] prayer
[56:35] what was the result
[56:38] heather was completely delivered from
[56:40] that problem
[56:43] peter talks about the order of things as
[56:45] well
[56:47] he's just encouraged the believers in uh
[56:49] second in first peter chapter one to
[56:51] love one another he says with a pure
[56:53] heart
[56:54] fervently
[56:55] reminded them that as humans we have a
[56:57] brief sojourn on earth
[56:59] but that the word of the lord endures
[57:01] forever the same thing that isaiah wrote
[57:03] in chapter 40. and then in first peter
[57:07] chapter 2 he goes on
[57:09] he says wherefore
[57:11] therefore in light of the transitory
[57:14] nature of our human lives
[57:17] laying aside all malice
[57:20] desiring or wishing evil or harm or
[57:23] damage to another and all guile
[57:26] deception
[57:27] misrepresentation
[57:29] and hypocrisies
[57:32] play acting
[57:33] pretending
[57:34] and envies
[57:36] wanting what another has or wanting them
[57:38] to not have it
[57:40] and all evil speakings
[57:42] there's enough there for the rest of
[57:44] this evening
[57:45] peter's telling us what we must do
[57:48] after which he says as newborn babes
[57:52] recent converts to christ
[57:55] having done what he just said
[57:57] had to do
[57:58] then and only then are we ready to start
[58:00] growing into christ
[58:02] desire the sincere milk of the word
[58:07] the easily digested the soft lessons
[58:11] that you may grow thereby
[58:13] growth
[58:14] is a process
[58:16] it requires nutrients
[58:18] energy
[58:19] instruction
[58:20] time remember we're talking about the
[58:23] order of things and in the context
[58:26] of the great commission
[58:28] if so be have tasted that the lord is
[58:31] gracious
[58:32] he goes on
[58:33] to whom coming
[58:35] that is coming to the lord
[58:38] as unto a living stone
[58:41] disallowed indeed of men but chosen of
[58:43] god and precious
[58:46] we read elsewhere christ is the chief
[58:48] cornerstone
[58:50] foundation
[58:51] the very beginning
[58:54] peter's reminding and exhorting here in
[58:57] ancient times buildings didn't have
[59:00] reinforced concrete slabs poured and
[59:02] then dimensional lumber framing
[59:05] dirt
[59:06] soil sand was removed
[59:09] down to the bedrock
[59:12] and then stones were shaped sometimes
[59:14] mortared
[59:15] into
[59:16] place and what's that bedrock that that
[59:19] foundation is built on jesus told peter
[59:22] upon this rock
[59:24] this bedrock the revelation of who i am
[59:28] i will build my church
[59:32] goes on he also is living stones
[59:35] or built up a spiritual house
[59:38] what's that a temple
[59:40] a habitation for god himself
[59:43] a building takes more than one stone
[59:47] each stone has to individually be shaped
[59:50] to fit properly to its neighboring
[59:53] stones if the structure is to have
[59:54] integrity
[59:56] to withstand the ravages of weather and
[59:59] time and remain
[1:00:02] try and count the bricks in the
[1:00:03] structure of this building where we're
[1:00:06] currently worshiping
[1:00:08] my friends
[1:00:09] we're in this
[1:00:11] together
[1:00:12] we can only function as a body a temple
[1:00:16] of the lord
[1:00:17] if we have unity
[1:00:19] not uniformity but unity
[1:00:23] a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual
[1:00:27] the sacrifice costs you something
[1:00:31] acceptable to god
[1:00:32] by jesus christ
[1:00:36] paul also refers to this really
[1:00:38] underscores that there's an order a
[1:00:40] progression to growth in the spiritual
[1:00:43] life of a christian
[1:00:45] as well as a goal
[1:00:48] he's scolding the congregation in this
[1:00:50] portion of his letter to the jewish
[1:00:52] christians in hebrews 5 verse 12.
[1:00:55] he says
[1:00:57] when for when for the time ye ought to
[1:01:00] be teachers
[1:01:03] by now
[1:01:05] paul says
[1:01:06] you've been instructed
[1:01:08] you've sat under careful ministry
[1:01:10] you've heard the word
[1:01:12] you've repented
[1:01:13] you've been baptized you've received the
[1:01:16] holy spirit
[1:01:18] but you're content to keep feasting
[1:01:20] rather than go out and work
[1:01:22] you should be out there bringing others
[1:01:24] in but instead ye have need that one
[1:01:26] teach you again
[1:01:29] paul says you've already been taught
[1:01:32] but you haven't put it into practice
[1:01:35] so your faith has grown weak instead of
[1:01:37] strong you haven't exercised that faith
[1:01:41] back to square one
[1:01:43] to being taught again
[1:01:45] and another place he describes those who
[1:01:47] are ever learning but never able to come
[1:01:50] to the knowledge of the truth
[1:01:52] we're not to sit
[1:01:54] and receive
[1:01:55] and then debate and argue and split
[1:01:59] we're to learn and apply and test and
[1:02:02] grow and become useful to god's kingdom
[1:02:06] he says that one teach you again which
[1:02:09] be the first principles of the oracles
[1:02:11] of god it becomes such as have need of
[1:02:14] milk
[1:02:16] not strong meat
[1:02:18] everyone that uses that depends on that
[1:02:21] requires milk is unskillful in the word
[1:02:24] of righteousness as peter said he's a
[1:02:27] babe
[1:02:29] strong meat food nourishment this is
[1:02:31] king james it's not talking about animal
[1:02:33] protein
[1:02:34] belongs to them
[1:02:36] that are of full age
[1:02:38] mature
[1:02:40] grown up
[1:02:42] adults
[1:02:43] even those who by reason of use
[1:02:47] those that have put theory into practice
[1:02:50] the ones james calls doers of the word
[1:02:52] and not hearers only have their senses
[1:02:55] exercised
[1:02:57] to discern both good and evil paul calls
[1:03:00] rightly dividing correctly interpreting
[1:03:03] applying
[1:03:06] well we spent considerable time this
[1:03:08] evening laying a foundation
[1:03:10] for understanding the great commission
[1:03:13] you're probably thinking
[1:03:15] yeah brother lyle i
[1:03:17] i know this of course are trying to grow
[1:03:19] to become mature christians
[1:03:21] what's your point
[1:03:24] we so often hear
[1:03:25] that we're to be witnesses
[1:03:28] we spoke last time about being salty
[1:03:31] about our value and the kingdom of god
[1:03:33] being directly related to being salty or
[1:03:36] of being a shining light
[1:03:39] but we
[1:03:41] i
[1:03:42] so often think that
[1:03:44] what we're asked to do is tell our
[1:03:46] testimony of how we came to the lord
[1:03:49] that's it done
[1:03:51] but jesus didn't simply say go into all
[1:03:54] the world and tell people your testimony
[1:03:56] that's part of it he didn't say
[1:03:59] go into all the world and be evangelists
[1:04:01] but that's part of it
[1:04:03] so you ask well well what did he say
[1:04:07] he said
[1:04:08] after you have received power from on
[1:04:11] high
[1:04:12] go into all the world
[1:04:14] preach the gospel and teach
[1:04:18] teach all nations
[1:04:20] teach them to observe my commandments
[1:04:23] in other words
[1:04:25] disciples
[1:04:28] disciples
[1:04:30] let's define and understand this word
[1:04:33] we'll look at the greek for a moment
[1:04:36] after all how often do you use the term
[1:04:38] disciple apart from church or a
[1:04:40] religious context
[1:04:42] no no
[1:04:43] it's not part of our modern english
[1:04:45] usage so let's look at the word used in
[1:04:47] matthew 28 19
[1:04:49] to go and teach
[1:04:52] the greek word is
[1:04:56] you don't need to remember that
[1:04:58] and intransitively in other words
[1:05:02] as the listener it means to become a
[1:05:04] pupil
[1:05:07] transitively that is the one that's
[1:05:09] speaking
[1:05:10] is to disciple
[1:05:12] to enroll as a scholar
[1:05:16] to instruct
[1:05:18] to teach
[1:05:20] well is this a new thing
[1:05:22] that jesus is telling us
[1:05:25] let's go back to israel in the
[1:05:26] wilderness in sinai deuteronomy chapter
[1:05:29] 5.
[1:05:31] moses called all israel
[1:05:34] and said unto them hear o israel
[1:05:37] listen up
[1:05:39] pay close attention
[1:05:41] to the statutes and judgments which i
[1:05:43] speak in your ears
[1:05:45] be hearers of the word
[1:05:47] which i speak in your ears this day
[1:05:50] that ye may
[1:05:51] learn them
[1:05:53] be students
[1:05:55] be disciples of the torah
[1:05:58] and keep
[1:06:00] and do them
[1:06:02] be doers of the word that you hear
[1:06:05] to learn the statutes and judgments
[1:06:08] the word
[1:06:09] become students
[1:06:11] disciples
[1:06:13] not just to pass an exam get a grade on
[1:06:16] a report card check a box on a list but
[1:06:19] immerse yourself in them
[1:06:21] thy word have i hid in my heart david
[1:06:24] wrote in the psalms that i might not sin
[1:06:26] against thee
[1:06:28] it's not some superficial thing later in
[1:06:31] deuteronomy
[1:06:33] moses tells people that you should
[1:06:35] speak of these things in the morning
[1:06:37] speak of them in the daytime speak of
[1:06:39] them in the evening teach your children
[1:06:41] it's an ongoing ongoing ongoing practice
[1:06:45] at the end of deuteronomy we read
[1:06:48] chapter 31
[1:06:50] verse 9 moses wrote this law
[1:06:53] and delivered it unto the priests the
[1:06:55] sons of levi which bear the ark of the
[1:06:57] covenant of the lord and unto all the
[1:06:59] elders of israel and moses commanded
[1:07:01] them
[1:07:03] it's not optional
[1:07:05] saying at the end of every seven years
[1:07:07] and the solemnity of the year of release
[1:07:09] and the feast of tabernacles
[1:07:12] pick up your feast of tabernacles
[1:07:14] when all israel has come to appear
[1:07:17] before the lord thy god and the place
[1:07:19] which he shall choose
[1:07:21] tabernacles was one of the three times
[1:07:23] in the year
[1:07:24] that they were together
[1:07:27] thou shalt read
[1:07:29] and he's telling them you read this
[1:07:30] aloud most people were unable to read
[1:07:33] literacy was not
[1:07:35] common
[1:07:37] read aloud this law before all israel
[1:07:41] how do we know he's reading it aloud
[1:07:42] because they're to read it in their
[1:07:44] hearing
[1:07:45] so you have to speak loud enough for
[1:07:47] them to hear and they have to be quiet
[1:07:49] enough to listen and pay attention
[1:07:52] so there's again a call to listen
[1:07:54] carefully he says gather the people
[1:07:57] together
[1:07:59] men
[1:08:00] women
[1:08:02] children
[1:08:04] all the descendants of jacob regardless
[1:08:06] of age or gender
[1:08:08] and to thy stranger that is within thy
[1:08:10] gates
[1:08:12] it's not just for the chosen it's for
[1:08:15] your neighbors as well
[1:08:17] and here's why they need to listen and
[1:08:19] pay attention that they may hear
[1:08:22] and that they may learn
[1:08:24] and fear the lord your god and observe
[1:08:27] to do all the words of this law
[1:08:31] it's so important that we be doers and
[1:08:35] not just hearers including of the great
[1:08:37] commission
[1:08:39] our topic this evening
[1:08:41] he says and that their children which
[1:08:43] have not known anything
[1:08:46] may hear
[1:08:47] and learn to fear the lord your god as
[1:08:49] long as you live in the land whether you
[1:08:51] go over jordan to possess it
[1:08:55] now
[1:08:56] those of you that are taking notes if
[1:08:58] you want a special blessing when you go
[1:09:00] home read nehemiah chapter 8. it's only
[1:09:02] 18 verses long and we call these few
[1:09:05] verses here from deuteronomy and see if
[1:09:08] you don't get a blessing maybe we'll
[1:09:09] talk about that some future time
[1:09:13] well god doesn't change
[1:09:15] his requirements don't change he imparts
[1:09:18] faith as a gift and requires faith
[1:09:22] how does faith come
[1:09:24] by hearing
[1:09:25] paying attention to
[1:09:27] learning the word
[1:09:29] to hear
[1:09:31] someone has to speak
[1:09:33] to teach
[1:09:34] and teaching is part of what we call the
[1:09:37] great commission
[1:09:39] peter said
[1:09:41] repent and be baptized every one of you
[1:09:43] on the day of pentecost some fifteen
[1:09:46] hundred years after moses spoke these
[1:09:49] words
[1:09:51] but notice what the church then did
[1:09:53] they had fellowship with one another
[1:09:56] they shared
[1:09:57] they reinforced one another
[1:10:00] the original disciples of jesus spent
[1:10:02] their time in prayer and in the word
[1:10:04] which meant being ignorant fishermen and
[1:10:07] so forth they had to learn how to read
[1:10:09] their later ministry
[1:10:11] some of which is recorded in acts showed
[1:10:13] their increasing level of maturity
[1:10:17] paul is very clear in his letter to the
[1:10:18] jewish believers the epistle to the
[1:10:20] hebrews that they needed to become
[1:10:22] teachers not remain milk-dependent
[1:10:25] babies
[1:10:27] in his letters to timothy he encouraged
[1:10:29] timothy to study to show himself
[1:10:31] approved
[1:10:32] to be able to rightly divide
[1:10:36] to not get caught up in endless
[1:10:37] arguments about genealogies and
[1:10:40] philosophies
[1:10:42] he told titus to set up leaders in the
[1:10:44] communities on crete
[1:10:48] well let's look at the ones we call the
[1:10:50] 12 disciples we're talking about
[1:10:53] disciples right
[1:10:55] jesus walked
[1:10:57] talked
[1:10:58] lived
[1:10:59] ate with him
[1:11:01] for more than three years
[1:11:03] he was quite the teacher
[1:11:05] there must have been some difficult
[1:11:06] times for jesus as the teacher as well
[1:11:09] as for the disciples as students
[1:11:13] when he taught
[1:11:15] and they didn't understand what he was
[1:11:16] saying he pulled them aside and
[1:11:19] explained things to them
[1:11:21] he instructed them
[1:11:23] patiently repeating
[1:11:26] when they were ready he sent them out in
[1:11:29] pairs to preach the good news to heal
[1:11:31] and to deliver
[1:11:33] and not just the 12 there were at least
[1:11:35] 70 up to that point as well as we read
[1:11:38] in luke 10.
[1:11:40] he didn't carefully select and choose
[1:11:43] people who were politically and
[1:11:44] philosophically compatible
[1:11:47] we've talked in the past how we had
[1:11:49] among the 12
[1:11:50] a roman collaborator
[1:11:53] matthew
[1:11:54] a despised corrupt minion of the
[1:11:56] occupying authority
[1:11:59] as one of his disciples
[1:12:02] and he had simon the zealot one whose
[1:12:05] background was to disrupt and destroy
[1:12:07] and even kill the hated roman occupiers
[1:12:11] part of the general group that led to
[1:12:13] the revolt some 30 years later in the
[1:12:15] destruction of the temple
[1:12:17] and 60 years after that the destruction
[1:12:19] of the land mass deportation of the
[1:12:21] jewish residents i wonder if when jesus
[1:12:24] was talking to the disciples at the end
[1:12:25] of his ministry and they were saying oh
[1:12:27] look at this great city in this temple
[1:12:29] and how wonderful it is and he said
[1:12:30] there won't be one stone left on another
[1:12:33] i wonder if he didn't
[1:12:35] look at simon the zealot when he said
[1:12:36] that knowing that it was the zealots
[1:12:39] that would provoke rome to bring about
[1:12:41] that destruction
[1:12:43] i doubt that simon the zealot and
[1:12:46] matthew would have been friends
[1:12:48] much less co-workers before jesus called
[1:12:51] them both
[1:12:53] i suspect whichever was first may have
[1:12:55] questioned jesus about the second now
[1:12:57] jesus you do know what kind of person he
[1:13:00] is
[1:13:02] right we don't know the political
[1:13:05] leanings of the other 10 or even of
[1:13:07] jesus himself but it's clear
[1:13:09] like in our country today
[1:13:11] people were deeply divided over their
[1:13:13] government its leaders its policies
[1:13:16] yet their disciples
[1:13:19] were able to walk together
[1:13:21] to talk together to learn together
[1:13:26] and change the world in a way they never
[1:13:28] could have imagined
[1:13:30] together
[1:13:32] in terms of backgrounds in addition to
[1:13:34] matthew the public and collaborator and
[1:13:36] simon the zealot four of them were
[1:13:38] commercial fishermen on the lake of
[1:13:40] galilee
[1:13:41] james john peter probably andrew
[1:13:44] the other six
[1:13:46] philip bartholomew
[1:13:48] thaddeus
[1:13:49] james son of alphaeus thomas
[1:13:52] judas iscariot
[1:13:54] we have no record
[1:13:56] or the order in which they joined his
[1:13:58] wandering band
[1:14:00] nor the other 70 who were also disciples
[1:14:03] and sent out to preach and teach and
[1:14:04] heal and deliver
[1:14:06] early in his public ministry
[1:14:08] nor when the various female disciples
[1:14:11] like mary magdalene salome joanna
[1:14:15] susanna joined them
[1:14:18] luke 8 and matthew 27 and other places
[1:14:21] in the gospels tell us there were many
[1:14:23] women that followed jesus from galilee
[1:14:26] and ministered to him
[1:14:29] we know peter was married we don't know
[1:14:32] about the other eleven
[1:14:33] what we do know
[1:14:35] is the all-called jesus
[1:14:37] master
[1:14:38] not like
[1:14:40] master slave boss business whatever but
[1:14:43] master is teacher
[1:14:45] rabbi an instructor
[1:14:48] one who is the master of what he taught
[1:14:51] remember
[1:14:53] when mary magdalene first saw the
[1:14:55] resurrected jesus
[1:14:58] she saw him and thought he was a
[1:14:59] gardener
[1:15:00] we read in john 2016 that when he
[1:15:02] identified himself to her by simply
[1:15:04] speaking her name
[1:15:06] mary
[1:15:08] what did we hear last sunday my sheep
[1:15:10] know my voice
[1:15:12] she immediately
[1:15:14] called him teacher
[1:15:17] master
[1:15:18] the source of knowledge to the student
[1:15:22] people were generally non-literate until
[1:15:24] very recent times
[1:15:26] literacy
[1:15:28] the ability to read and write was
[1:15:29] uncommon in the ancient world
[1:15:32] there were no public libraries the books
[1:15:34] as we know them didn't exist
[1:15:36] there were scrolls and codices a
[1:15:39] forerunner of a book these were
[1:15:41] extremely expensive
[1:15:43] the few libraries that did exist were
[1:15:45] renowned such as the one in alexandria
[1:15:48] in egypt
[1:15:50] when jesus reads from the isaiah scroll
[1:15:52] and the synagogue and nazareth are told
[1:15:54] that all eyes were on him
[1:15:56] is not this the carpenter's son
[1:15:59] they marveled at his teaching
[1:16:02] later in the temple we're told in john's
[1:16:04] gospel that the jews marveled saying how
[1:16:07] knoweth this man letters having never
[1:16:10] learned
[1:16:11] in other words
[1:16:13] reading was a specialized skill
[1:16:16] how where did he learn to read
[1:16:19] teaching was oral to go into the world
[1:16:22] and teach all nations making disciples
[1:16:25] means that we must grow to know the
[1:16:26] scriptures and be able to share
[1:16:29] teach them to others becoming the
[1:16:32] teachers
[1:16:33] and the listeners becoming disciples
[1:16:36] students
[1:16:38] and they are to eventually become
[1:16:40] teachers themselves as we read in the
[1:16:42] letter to the hebrews after all
[1:16:44] they're us
[1:16:46] right
[1:16:47] the greek commission
[1:16:50] as i mentioned already there's an order
[1:16:52] to things
[1:16:54] as in any life there's birth
[1:16:56] growth
[1:16:57] eventual maturity
[1:17:00] and part one of the great commission is
[1:17:02] to be a witness
[1:17:04] a preacher a declarer
[1:17:07] i often think of my friend brother mike
[1:17:09] yarborough in this context
[1:17:12] when he was an undergraduate student at
[1:17:14] rice university in houston texas
[1:17:17] he made acquaintance with another
[1:17:19] student named carl mount
[1:17:22] carl had recently become a christian
[1:17:24] he began to participate in a group
[1:17:26] called campus crusade for christ
[1:17:30] for those of you that are younger than
[1:17:31] me
[1:17:32] well that's most of you the term crusade
[1:17:35] was often used during the 1940s and 50s
[1:17:39] and 60s to mean a campaign to reach
[1:17:42] to conquer general eisenhower the
[1:17:45] supreme commander of allied forces in
[1:17:48] europe and world war ii
[1:17:50] called the allied campaign to defeat
[1:17:51] hitler's so-called fortress europe a
[1:17:54] crusade
[1:17:56] billy graham turned his evangelistic
[1:17:58] campaign's crusades to conquer the world
[1:18:01] for christ
[1:18:02] spreading the gospel message of
[1:18:04] salvation
[1:18:06] in 1951 bill and jonette bright founded
[1:18:09] campus crusade for christ it's now
[1:18:12] called crew
[1:18:13] on the campus of ucla los angeles
[1:18:17] campus crusade's mission was making
[1:18:19] disciples
[1:18:21] not just converts
[1:18:22] and that meant doing
[1:18:24] not just hearing
[1:18:26] one of the goals was to reach at least
[1:18:28] one person a week for christ
[1:18:31] carl mounts for such assignment was mike
[1:18:34] yarborough
[1:18:36] many of you have heard mike's testimony
[1:18:38] i won't try to give it here i suspect
[1:18:41] it's in the archives of the church mike
[1:18:43] spoke here a couple of sunday evenings
[1:18:44] in 2013 or 14 had carl mount here as
[1:18:47] well
[1:18:49] mike became an active witness for christ
[1:18:51] his entire life
[1:18:53] certainly over all the years when i was
[1:18:55] acquainted with him
[1:18:58] the great commission
[1:19:01] go ye therefore
[1:19:02] teach all nations
[1:19:04] baptizing them in the name of the father
[1:19:06] the son and the holy ghost teaching them
[1:19:09] to observe all things whatsoever i have
[1:19:12] commanded you
[1:19:14] and lo i'm with you always
[1:19:16] i'll work together with you in this
[1:19:19] even unto the end of the world
[1:19:22] jesus was clear
[1:19:24] through some of his commands to us
[1:19:26] love god
[1:19:28] love others he said on these two
[1:19:30] commands hung all the law and the
[1:19:32] prophets
[1:19:34] repent of our sins
[1:19:36] believe in him
[1:19:38] spread the good news
[1:19:41] god's salvation was never meant to be a
[1:19:43] secret
[1:19:45] when i was young
[1:19:46] the bible was generally accepted as
[1:19:48] being authoritative or at least not to
[1:19:50] be ignored or despised
[1:19:52] it wasn't unusual to be discussing some
[1:19:55] aspects of it
[1:19:56] and the playground of the public school
[1:19:58] that i attended as a kid
[1:20:00] we'd sometimes discuss our sunday school
[1:20:02] lessons with others and compare what
[1:20:04] their church taught not to challenge not
[1:20:07] to disagree
[1:20:08] but simply to share with each other
[1:20:11] these days
[1:20:12] a skeptical world rejects biblical
[1:20:15] authority demands supporting evidence
[1:20:19] and sadly
[1:20:20] many christians today
[1:20:23] approach the bible confrontationally
[1:20:26] insist that their interpretation of the
[1:20:28] bible is the only accurate one
[1:20:31] usually with no background other than
[1:20:33] what they heard some preacher claim it
[1:20:35] meant
[1:20:37] when we witness and share with others
[1:20:40] we need to be careful
[1:20:42] to get the foundation
[1:20:44] the fundamentals in place
[1:20:48] come up here thank you
[1:20:50] no one is saved because they believe
[1:20:53] brother branham was a prophet
[1:20:55] or that believing jesus is the son of
[1:20:57] god
[1:20:58] or that he died on the cross for our
[1:21:00] sins
[1:21:01] our salvation
[1:21:03] our eternal life hangs on the thread of
[1:21:05] each one
[1:21:07] recognizing his or her individual sin
[1:21:11] sincerely repenting
[1:21:13] accepting jesus christ as personal
[1:21:16] savior
[1:21:17] surrendering his or her life to him
[1:21:22] we must enter a relationship with him
[1:21:24] such that we not only claim to know him
[1:21:27] but his brother adam shared with us last
[1:21:29] sunday
[1:21:30] he knows us
[1:21:33] nothing else will do
[1:21:35] and the salvation of our neighbor
[1:21:38] may depend on our sharing
[1:21:40] these truths
[1:21:42] lord
[1:21:44] help us not to be guilty of that
[1:21:45] iniquity
[1:21:46] to know to do right and refrain from
[1:21:48] doing it
[1:21:50] and always to be sensitive to your
[1:21:52] spirit guiding us each step along our
[1:21:54] path of life
[1:21:56] as we close
[1:21:59] i'd like us to sing a song about
[1:22:00] spreading the good news
[1:22:03] there's a verse that comes to mind and
[1:22:05] it reads like the great commission
[1:22:07] but it was written by isaiah
[1:22:11] isaiah 52 7 how beautiful upon the
[1:22:14] mountains
[1:22:15] are the feet of him that bringeth good
[1:22:17] tidings good news the gospel
[1:22:20] that publishes peace that brings good
[1:22:22] tidings of good that publishes salvation
[1:22:25] publish means to spread not to print
[1:22:28] that saith unto zion thy god reigneth
[1:22:32] the song i'd like us to sing
[1:22:35] it's actually taken from a christmas
[1:22:37] carol go tell it on the mountains
[1:22:40] i'm i'm using some verses that i heard
[1:22:43] george beverly shea
[1:22:45] used during the billy graham crusades in
[1:22:47] the 50s
[1:22:49] we'll start with the chorus as brother
[1:22:50] aaron comes to close the service if you
[1:22:52] know it sing if you don't know it sing
[1:22:55] anyway

[1:22:58] couple of verses here

[1:23:06] over the hills and everywhere
[1:23:11] go
[1:23:12] tell it on the mountains
[1:23:16] that jesus christ is lord
[1:23:21] when i was a learner
[1:23:26] i sought both night and day
[1:23:31] i asked the lord to aid me
[1:23:35] and he showed me the way
[1:23:43] the
[1:23:44] mountains over the hills and everywhere

[1:23:55] that jesus christ is lord
[1:24:00] he made me
[1:24:02] a watchman
[1:24:05] upon
[1:24:06] the city wall
[1:24:09] and though i am a christian
[1:24:14] i am the least of all

[1:25:00] i can sing that song
[1:25:03] i would i would not like to be there
[1:25:05] that day
[1:25:07] and my neighbor said lord he never told
[1:25:10] me he never shared it with me
[1:25:14] what a shame that would be
[1:25:17] let us not be afraid to say do you know
[1:25:19] this jesus christ the joy of my life
[1:25:22] amen
