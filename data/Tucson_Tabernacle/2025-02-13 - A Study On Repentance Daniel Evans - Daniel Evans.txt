can be seated if you like um we're going to sing just as I am this song's been on my heart for quite some time and I thought maybe tonight would be a good night to sing it but this song was when the Lord started dealing with me I was 28 years old and uh this kind of became my prayer the whole song is uh the words to it are Like a Prayer or it is a prayer but um I looked up the history behind the song and um so I wanted to share that um not just read no other song written has had the impact of drawing Believers to Christ as just as I am its pleading Cry of surrending surrendering our all to the Savior and beckons us to a relationship with him has been sung across the world in churches for altar calls it was song it was a song used by Billy Graham Crusades at the close of services when attendees would come forward to accept the Lord Jesus it's written by charl Charlotte ell Elliott in 1834 and published in 1835 as a poem Charlotte Elliot was born in Brighton England on March 18th 1789 her father was a silk Merchant her mother was daughter of a Preacher during her childhood she was afforded the better things in life and raised in a Christian home she had received the best education had a passion for music and art yet during her young years she could not accept the fact that she could come to know the father with all the sin she struggled with the fact of unworthiness and felt she could not come before a perfect and loving God with her imperfect life [Music] many years later after being part of a social scene where religion was not talked about she felt ill and found herself isolated and alone after suffering the terrible illness with bouts of depression and ill health she felt as if she had nothing to give an evangelist friend of her father Henry Caesar Milan came to visit the family and asked her if she knew Christ and offended by this question she replied she did not discuss the topic he apologized for offending her but explained to her that he always liked to speak of his master and only hoped that one day she would come to know him as her Savior and be a worker for Christ a few weeks after this encounter they met again and Charlotte explained that ever since he had posed the question she had not been able to get it off off of her mind she explained she did not know how to come to Christ and he explained Come Just As You Are Believing on Jesus as your personal savior it is said she went away rejoicing in the fact that she now understood what it was to be accepted and loved by the Lord Jesus Christ 12 years later she continued to suffer bouts of depression it was during this time that her brother was was working at a respectable School in England and was giving the daughters of a clergyman at a respectable School in England to give Daughters of clergymen a higher education it was decided a bizarre would be held to raise money for the school it seemed everyone was involved in planning and working the event except Mary who still at times battled with her salvation in her mind it was the night before the B bizarre Mary wrestled with these nagging thoughts the next morning the same thoughts returned with more intensity and it was then that Mary got out her pen and decided once and for all she would conquer those thoughts with the facts of her salvation not her emotions on it but the facts of the Lord's love his Mercy his power it was then and there not in the the past tense or in a one-time passing moment but in the even now moment that she was accepted in the Lord Jesus it was in this experience that she pinned the words just as I am and as I said this song was instrumental when the Lord started dealing with me and it was the first song I ever played on the guitar in my room alone [Music] and it was my prayer to him just as I am I don't have any other plea but that your blood was shed for me and that you've bid me come to thee so let's sing [Music] it just Dan I am without one thing but that thy blood was shed for me and that you have B me come to thee your of God I come I come just stand I am I'm waiting on to R my soul of one dark BL to the whose blood can cleanse each SP Oh Land Of God I come I [Music] Come Just As I Am though to about with me conlict and many doubt there's fings and fears within without Oh Land Of God I come I Come Just As I Am I will rece will

thou has been in come to thee Oh Lamb of God I come I come oh Lamb of God we come before you Lord with humbleness of heart and grateful for our Salvation Lord all that youve done for us and all that

seated God bless you brother Joe good to have you here and family God bless you it's um missing a lot of people and it's nice the Robson family helps fill in some of the gaps um it's good it's good to see everyone tonight and very important subject tonight in this subject on repentance it's actually I think it could be one of the most as far as we are concerned as Believers one of the most if not the most important thing that we understand what repentance is we um on Wednesday night we have our Bible study and uh we started with the book of Acts and we went through every chapter of the book of Acts and we went through the Bible we went through every book of the Old Testament and now we are um going into a different studies on different characters in The Bible brother Lyle has been expounding on the life of this great man Joseph and it was requested for me that I take a subject and expound upon a subject and brother Jordan suggested this um repentance this this study on repentance and he said he just told me earlier that he said someone came to him and said that the Bible says repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ what does that word repent mean it's a really good question I think that we uh we might know um but we might think we know what this word means but repentance is not regret it's not guilt repentance is is everyone really feels bad if they do something wrong if if they I know that there's personality dis disorders but anyone in their right mind really they feel bad if they do something wrong whether they're not a Christian or not that's not repentance the Bible says that even God repented very strange thing it's impossible for God to sin he's perfect so he's never made a mistake so why would the bible say that God repented in certain extent the the king in the King James the Old King James language it's it's a carryover of an old term but on the other hand it really does mean that actual word of repent when we read that in the Bible and that God did that so how can God repent Bible says he he does the definition of this word repent it's from a Greek word it comes I mean all the New Testament is from a Greek word but um it's from the Greek word metanoia and it means a change of mind or a change of heart and there's a difference as I said between a a a true repentance and mere mere regret are mere feeling guilty so how how could God repent God knows what he's doing God knows what he's going to do God knows what we are going to do and what decisions that we are going to make and God is never wrong so how can he ever change his mind about anything but listen to this so we know that the Bible says that that God repented but numbers 2319 says this God is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent hath he said and shall not he do it or hath he spoken and shall he not make it good so I understand that there's a difference between God's perfect will and God's permissive will but there's also a predestination which means it's not Calvinism means that doesn't mean that you don't have a choice in the matter that you're just for ordained to do what you're going to do that's not what predestination means that that uh that you're going to make certain decisions because they're ordained for you to do that God what predestination means is God knows what decisions that you are going to make before you make them you're still a free moral agent you still decide your ultimate destination God knows the beginning from the end so he knows what decision that you're going to make so how can God repent and when the Bible said right there that he can't repent Moses I mean God one time it says there that he repented that he ever made man and then another time God the Moses came before the Lord and he said you should repent of the evil that you're going to do against these children of Israel that you brought them out with a mighty hand and they're going to be out here and die in the wilderness and then the Egyptians are going to make fun of them so how could Moses have a better idea than God had it does it doesn't make sense so let me put it into into terms that I believe that um are ex answer this question if you're headed down a road to destruction you're going down there God's word says that if you go down this road of Destruction you're going to go to hell you're going to die you're going to have a terrible life God's word says that so you're going down this bad Road and then the Lord gets a hold of you and you change and then you repent of of your evil doings you repent of of your bad ways and you change directions so then God who ordained you to to be to your ultimate destination would be death and hell then God you make this decision to change then God changes his Direction because now you are on a different path and you are the on the path to eternal life and you are on the on the path to Prosperity so you change you made the decision God didn't say oh I was wrong in this no he gave you the decision you were going down this path God's word said that you were going to die and then you changed and you went in the right direction and the same goes for if you are on on the right path like the children of Israel they came out of Egypt now they were on the right path they were going into canaan's land they were going into the promised land so now they are going and they switch and they go back into sin God's ordained path was for them to go into the promised land and to prosper now they change and they go into idolatry they go into complaining they go into all these things so now God repents he has a change because of your change because of their change God doesn't change but now you went on a different path they went on a different path and it went into destruction so God's conversation with Moses and when Moses said Lord you should change what happened was the children of Israel didn't change God says okay I'll change but they have to go in the right direction my way is perfect they didn't go in the right direction and they still thousands of them were killed right after that and none of them except for two actually received the promise that God gave them because they didn't they repented of going down the right way they changed had a change of mind and wanted to go into sin and they went into destruction so that is how repenting is just it's a change of mind it's a change of Direction so God gives us choices and we make the choice so when I think of repentance I always think of one man he is the first one that comes to my mind is John the Baptist John the Baptist his message was repent let's go to Matthew chapter 3 verse one listen to this in those days Came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judea and saying repent ye for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet isaas saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord maketh path his path straight and the same John had had his rment of camel's hair and his and a leather girdle about his loins and his meat was Locust and wild honey then went out to him then went out to him Jerusalem and all of Judea and all the region around Jordan and were baptized of him confessing their sins but when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees C come to his baptism he said unto them oh you Generation of Vipers who hath warned you to flee from the Wrath to come bring forth therefore fruits meat for repentance the English Standard Version says bear fruit in keeping with repentance and think not to say within yourselves we have Abraham to Our Father for I say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise children raise up children of Abraham and now also the ax is laid to the root of the trees therefore every tree which bringeth forth good fruit is heun down and cast into the fire now listen to this listen to John the Baptist message it's beautiful because we can see it later on in the Bible I indeed baptize you with baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I am not worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire so we have a command from from John to repent and John was baptizing to repentance and we have a prophecy from John the Baptist a prophet of God that there is a promise associated with repentance I will baptize you with repentance and then he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost so John baptized according to repent rep to repentance and like I said before repentance is not just your conscience making you feel feel bad it's not regret it's not guilt that could be the start of repentance and unfortunately it almost always is with a human being like we talk with brother Arie always he's always witnessing to this homeless people around and it's always they regret so much the decisions that they've made they they have such guilt and they look back and they say well I wish I wouldn't have taken that first drug I wish I wouldn't have started smoking pot right there because that was my game way drug and now I'm on heroin or I'm on meth or or fentanyl or whatever it is and and now I can't get off of it and they have this great regret because it's ruined their lives and this guilt and they just feel so bad about themselves the way they look and everything it's so sad but there's no repentance there there there's no willingness to change because they love the drug they love the street life more than they want to change their lives there's no there's no repentance and it's a beautiful testimony of this John the Baptist he baptized according to repentance to A Change John um6 says this about John the Baptist there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that light light that was the True Light which lith every man that cometh into the world so John has a two-fold ministry here he has a two-fold um he has a two-fold message of repentance John was sent to call the people to repent to Bear a witness to get them to make changes in their lives and then later Christ would come what a message of hope that John the Baptist had you know we we I just talked about people who they they regret things and they have guilt in their life but they won't repent they won't make changes but then there's also on the other side and I see it so many times people come up for prayer and they're just they struggle and they struggle because they have made such mistakes and they can't get past them and I always ask him well do you change your way of thinking well yeah I don't I don't think like that anymore did you make changes in your life where you're overcoming the old s well yeah I don't do that anymore but I still did it if it was stealing you feel the guilt of of of that sin you know do you did you do your best if you stole did you do your best to make it right and are you still SE are you still stealing stealing no you're not you've repented you have actually done what John the Baptist said you've actually done these things you have changed your life so don't keep dwelling on that sin don't keep dwelling on the mistake that you made that is in the past you did make a mistake but you changed you repented it's over it's gone if it was adultery you feel the guilt of that but are you still committing adultery no that song that brother Michael sang in in the story just as I am you don't battle with your salvation you've repented you've changed you've laid it in in the presence of of Jesus Christ the Savior leave it there let it go that's there's that's no longer can condemn you quit trying to pull it out from under the blood you can't get it out from under the blood it's gone but Satan is there to try to keep accusing you all the time and trying to put this in your mind so it takes away that Joy of your salvation there's a story about um I've told this story in service before but it's it's a perfect story of repentance and that's this man named Wilbur Shane he was my I believe he was my grandfather wheeler his cousin and if you're a tape listener you know the story he was his wife came to brother brandom and she was losing her mind she was she was she she was overcome with anxiety and she was overcome with with with this just this horrible feeling she thought that she was going crazy so she comes to the house brother brandom and sister brandom they talk with her and she's telling telling brother brandom she has all all these problems and and she's she's going crazy and brother brandom through the discernment that he has and the Holy Spirit that operated in that gift he said sister you had an affair on your husband and she said who told you that and he said it's the truth she said don't you say that to anyone I made that right with God so then brother Braham says you didn't sin against God you sinned against your husband and there was no repentance there there was con there was uh there was guilt and that guilt was causing her to lose her mind and causing her to have all this anxiety but she had not yet repented so then brother brandom tells her go get your husband because he's guilty of the same thing she says not my husband he says oh yeah your husband she goes and tells her husband her husband immediately confesses they came to brother Brandon that man was a deacon in the church and he had an affair on his wife I used to talk to him on the phone he lived to be 99 years and 364 four days and he missed 100 like a few hours but I used to I used to talk to him on the phone and he never wanted to talk about that that was something that was in his past he didn't deny it but he wanted to leave that back there so he was a deacon in that church he and his wife get together they repent they made it right with each other they lived out their Earthly lives together in happiness enjoy he was a he was the um a deacon in the church and he told me he became the pastor of the church later on and he pastored that church for decades good man but it shows there was regret and there was guilt that was driving the lady crazy but when she repented and he repented it wiped it all away what a beautiful story of John the Baptist ministry and and the holy Spirit repent so see how important John's um Ministry was people were coming to be baptized we don't understand we baptized to repentance you got to understand what baptizing to repentance means it means you did wrong you had sin in your life so you came to John and you confessed that sin and you said I'm going to change John and he says okay come here on the and be baptized and he would baptize them and say now don't do it again and they their lives would change that's how important this baptism of repentance was but it came with a promise that John said I will baptize you to this repentance so that you can get your life right but there is coming one that is going to baptize you with the Holy Ghost in fire Matthew chapter 3:1 let me read it again I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after you is mightier than I whose shoes I am not worthy to Bear he shall B baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire now we see the second promise it should be ringing a bell as I'm as I'm talking about this baptized to repentance and then with the Holy Ghost what scripture does that the first time it was fulfilled where is this fulfilled say louder Acts chapter 2 Acts chapter 2:37 Peter just been had just finished preaching this beautiful sermon on Jesus Christ being the Lamb of God and he said and and it says now when they heard this they were pricked in their hearts there was the beginning of repentance right there they knew that they had sinned they knew that they had to they knew that they had to make changes they felt remorse or regret for their sins that's the first step but true repentance had not happened yet or the next statement would not not have been necessary they were pricked in their heart and they said unto the Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do they had the regret and now they wanted to repent they wanted to make it right but they just didn't know what to do acts 238 Peter said unto them repent so the desire to serve the Lord and the remorse for their their sins was not enough Peter's giving them a commandment to further to further the regret and have a change of heart go further than just regret go further than the guilt and have a total change of heart change a change of plans in your whole life a change of your desire and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins so repentance and bapti and baptism are directly tied to the washing away of sins New International Version says repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the Forgiveness of your sins now watch this remember John said the one coming after me I baptized to repentance but the one coming after me is going to baptize you with the Holy Ghost in fire repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the for the Forgiveness of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for This Promise is unto you and your children and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call perfect type of John the Baptist ministry that Acts chapter two his prophecy indeed I baptize you with water unto repentance but he that comes after me is mightier than I who shoes I am not worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire John the Baptist was a prophet and I mean Jesus said he was the greatest of all the prophets and he exactly acts chap 2:38 through repentance perfectly fulfilled John's prophecy so repentance wasn't limited to John the Baptist ministry it was so important that the first thing that Jesus himself preached was repentance he comes out he's baptized by John it's just beautiful everything just lines up so perfectly he's baptized by John he gets out of the water he goes into the Wilderness and fasts for 40 days and his his body really becomes weak of course if you fast that long but a fast you get weak in your body but you get strong in the spirit and that's how Jesus was out there he was he was at his weakest point maybe with his body with his flesh but he was at the strongest in his spirit because he was totally surrendered to God and totally not that I know he was God in flesh but he was in flesh and his Spirit was strong he says I mean right after he was baptized he grew stronger in spirit then verse number let's uh Matthew chapter 4 I'll start with verse 12 I think we have time to read it verse 12 Matthew 4:12 says this now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison he departed into Galilee and leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt in capernium which is upon the Sea Coast the borders of zebulun and neth that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet isaas isaas The Prophet saying the land of zebulun and the land of netham by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan of Galilee of the Gentiles the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and in the shadow of death light has sprung up now listen to this and from that time Jesus began to preach and to say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand so repentance was the doctrine of John the Baptist and now it is the very first doctrine of Jesus Christ This is the first subject that we have that he preached on came out of the Wilderness and now his ministry starts and it's repentance and then there's a as we get into David here there's a process of repentance you you're convicted of sin by the Holy Spirit that's where you feel that guilt you feel that regret you know I mean how many times have I felt it it's like Lord I'm messed up I said something wrong I did something wrong I feel so stupid I feel so bad and then don't stop there now change directions and say I'm not going to do that I'm going to learn from this and I'm going to change so we have that conviction then we have that confession that acknowledgement of sin Lord I sinned I did wrong and then we have that turning away from sin that goes towards God this listen to this a couple scriptures I'll read here 1 John 1:9 says this we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us so he is faithful to forgive our sins if we make that confession in Acts 3:19 repent ye therefore Peter speaking repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord repent and be baptized for the washing away of your sins for the Forgiveness of your sins and I want to close with um with the story on King David and this is always a story that really troubled me with David and Uriah and basba so David was the king Uriah was a great man I don't think we give Uriah enough credit he was one of David's I only had 35 37 mighty men that fought with David Uriah fought side by side with David in battles he was one of his greatest warriors he was one of his most trusted people he was he was so close to David that his house was close to David's house so David is here and and David Uriah is out to battle and and you know the story David goes out on his rooftop and he sees this woman and he tells his servant go who is this and go get her and and she comes and David is the king he's the greatest man in all the all the world and ba Sheba is her name baath Sheba Falls in sin David Falls in sin with this woman and then she conceives this baby so now David doesn't know what to do he wants to cover his tracks so he goes and brings Uriah back and he wants Uriah to sleep with his wife so then Uriah might think it's it's his his child so he brings Uriah back Uriah says no not when my men are out there fighting I can't do that I can't be with my wife I can't do this I'm just GNA sleep out here on the steps and then I'm gonna go back back to battle what a great man Uriah was I mean a tremendous character in that man so David sends him back he sends message to joab stick him out close to the close to the wall pull back let him let Uriah die in battle terrible horrible story David basically murders this man then David Goes to uh the prophet Nathan comes to David tells him the story about about the lamb about there's this man that that had this single lamb and loved this lamb and and there was this rich man that had all of these these sheeps and herds and and everything and and this rich man wanted this this poor man's lamb and he goes and takes it and leaves that man without a lamb and and David says I'll kill him he should he should never have done I'll teach that man a lesson then Nathan says David you're that man David IM immediately immediately felt guilt and remorse over what he did and then David wrote this Psalm about that story and this Psalm I uh I never understood and just in praying about this during this this week and and and not understanding how David could murder this this man and then still be a man after God's Own Heart it always troubled me and especially this PSAL he says something in this Psalm that has always I just never understood it and I'll read it to you Psalm 51 and we'll read most most of this Psalm David writing this because of the guilt and the repentance for doing what he did to Uriah have mercy upon me oh God according to thy loving kindness according unto the multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out my transgressions Wash Me thoroughly from mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for I acknowledge my transgression and my sin is ever before me look at the guilt that's on David I'm always thinking about this sin I I did this wrong and and I can't get over it and it's it's really bothering me I I murdered a man not just a man I murdered a friend I had I I I committed adultery with his wife and this guilt was just all over David my sin is ever before me against thee this is the one that I i' never understood against thee the only have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight he's praying to God he's writing this Psalm the song to God and he says God against you and only you I have sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judgest it's a troubling scripture has always been troubling to me it looks like very much like David sinned against Uriah and not necessarily against the Lord remember the story about wil Shane and his wife you sinned against each other and here is David and he said Lord I sinned against you and you only it's like how could David David say that while being Anointed with the Holy Spirit singing this this is the word of God this isn't just a letter David wrote This is the infall ible word of God spoken by the Bible calls David a prophet spoken by him Anointed with the Holy Spirit and he says I've sinned against you God and only you I said David had 37 just Elite fighting men and amongst those he must have fought side by side with this man Uriah Uriah was a loal friend and a loyal Soldier to this this man David and I read that verse and I say what about Uriah what about this mighty man why wasn't David repenting from him I tell you what if I was in uriah's place and I David killed me and I'm up there I'm like you wait until you die and I'm going to be the first one that meets you and it's going to be you think your death is going to bead you wait till you get over on this other side cuz I'm going to take you out that's the flesh but David he says I sinned against God and he what could overcome that hatred of Uriah In the Flesh what would be greater than uriah's hat hatred for somebody that did such a bad thing to him what could overcome that it' be his love for his wife so look at David here and I'm not saying that this is the answer to the question this is me this is my opinion you put David there and David sees I have taken this man's lamb I have killed him I've done a horrible act I did a horrible act to this woman I caused her to commit adultery the baby that was conceived dies what can I do what could I if somebody did me wrong and they murdered me what would be the best thing that you could do to me take care of my family take care of bath Sheba so here's David and I know it it sounds it's sounds strange because she became his wife but she didn't just become his wife he promoted her all the way to the top they had Solomon was it really David's choice of Solomon read the story it was basheba and she says hey you're going to let the your older son you're going to let him have this are you going to let Solomon my son David says Solomon every single thing that that woman B Sheba did David promoted her loved her took care of her and it was a different time back then so they had different values that we might not think of right today but he took care of the woman could it have been that he took such good care of her because of his repentance and his love for Uriah I'm not saying that that's the answer just saying that as I've never been able to put two and two together on this and it really it shows that that David was I really believe that he he honored Uriah with taking care of this wife and even more than that David says this against thee and thee only have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight and it shows when you sin against one of God's children you are sinning against God am and it's much worse for you to sin against God than it is to sin against me we don't want to ever do that but when you sin against God's children you are in fact sinning against the almighty sinning against God and you think about the story of of Jesus he went to the Cross died from my sins died for my lies died for for the things that I I had done whatever what whatever is in our past Jesus Christ died for those things and now we go we die and who's the one that meets us it's not this it's welcome my bride very different than the way that we would normally act back to verse four against thee and thee only have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judgest the NIV version says against you and only you have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight so you are right in your verdict and Justified when you judge Lord I deserve your judgment I deserve it I deserved it when the baby died I deserved it when my son Absalon took the king the kingdom David is crying out and said I'm a sinner and I deserve your judgment behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me look at the look at the the regret and look at the David and the guilt that David is saying I am so bad we often say say I was born in sin and shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies look at how evil I am but where is the repentance and all this I haven't seen it yet in David where is the change of heart where is the change of mind this is the beginning like I said repentance starts with guilt it starts with regret it starts with feeling bad let's skip to verse 10 he says this create in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit within me this is the key verse David is saying I sinned I want to change Lord change me create in me a a clean heart and review and and and take it and renew a right spirit in me change me so here's the repentance of David was all regret regret regret I did wrong and I I feel terrible and and I'm depressed and and Lord I just hate myself I did all of this and now Lord change me there's the repentance I want to change so many people as I said they can't get over the sin they'll come and get prayed for and they're they're embarrassed they did something that embarrassed them and and it stays in their mind all the time but they don't realize that they can move forward they don't they don't have to live in the past God can take the worst of sins and turn it around if you are willing to change your mind if you are willing to change your way of thinking if you are willing to change from serving yourself to serving God look at David changed everything and even David said he he said Lord put The Joy back in my restore the joy of my salvation he didn't say his salvation was lost he said restore that and never if you have repented if you have changed don't keep living in the past it's gone it is under the blood it goes on cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me the musicians if if you would come on close restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit then I will teach transgressors Thy Thy ways and sinners will be converted unto thee so you see the change you see the repentance another repen of statement Lord my ways are going to are going to change and I'm going to point people now to you my sins are forgiven Lord I'm going to change my way skip to 16 for thou desirest not sacrifice else I would give it Lord I'd give anything I would give anything to make these sins right but that's not what you desire thou Delight us not in burnt offering God didn't want something really didn't want something to die right he never did he wanted us to live he didn't want Adam Adam and Eve to die but they repented of that road that they were going on they were going on eternal life and they changed and they went to sin and God's word was if you go down here you will die if you go here you will live God's word God's God's desire was that they live and they were going that way they changed and God repented and moved this way and says no my word says you're going to die because you went that direction thank God that there is a Salvation that there is a savior for thou desirest not sacrifice else I would give it thou Delight us not in burnt offering here's the path of the sinner back to God the sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit a broken and contrite heart oh God thou will not despise a broken and contrite contrite heart God you will not hate that you will not reject that it's sincere do good in thy good pleasure un Zion build thou the walls of Jerusalem then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice es of right of righteousness with burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings then they shall offer bulock upon thine altar repent change your ways and then God will accept your life and he will make a way repentance is one of the most important subjects in the entire book we have to understand what it is it is not just guilt guilt leads should lead to repentance repentance is a change of mind it's a change of path it's a change of life and we have that else Peter wouldn't have said Repent Jesus wouldn't have said repent John wouldn't have said repent if we didn't have the
