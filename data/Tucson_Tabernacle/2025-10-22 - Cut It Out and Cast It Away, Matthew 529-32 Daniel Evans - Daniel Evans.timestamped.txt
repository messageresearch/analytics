[31:52] Amen. Let's open our Bibles before we're
[31:55] seated.
[31:57] If you guys continue to play with me,
[32:00] Matthew chapter 5, I'll start with verse
[32:03] 27.
[32:04] Back on the sermon on the mount.
[32:12] [Music]
[32:18] Matthew 5 27 I'll read through 32. You
[32:21] have heard that it was said by them of
[32:23] old time, thou shalt not commit
[32:25] adultery.
[32:27] But I say unto you, who that whosoever
[32:29] lookth upon a woman, to lust after her,
[32:32] hath committed adultery with her already
[32:33] in his heart. And if thy right hand
[32:36] offend thee, that word offend is old
[32:39] English. That word, that word means
[32:42] causes you to sin.
[32:45] And if thy right hand causes you to sin,
[32:47] pluck it out. That right eye causes you
[32:49] to sin, pluck it out and cast it from
[32:51] thee. For it is profitable for thee that
[32:54] one of thy members should perish. and
[32:56] not that thy whole body should be cast
[32:58] into hell.
[33:00] And if thy right hand offend thee, cut
[33:02] it off, and cast it from thee. For it is
[33:05] profitable for thee that one of thy
[33:07] members should perish, and not that thy
[33:09] whole body should be cast into hell. And
[33:12] it has been said, whosoever shall put
[33:14] away his wife, let him give her a
[33:17] writing of divorcement. But I say unto
[33:18] you, that whosoever shall put away his
[33:20] wife, saving for the cause of
[33:22] fornication, causes her to commit
[33:24] adultery. And whosoever shall marry her
[33:27] that is divorced commits adultery. God
[33:30] bless you. You can be seated. Thank you.
[33:36] I don't see
[33:39] I don't see any visitors and I don't
[33:40] have any notes for visitors. But
[33:44] friends, it feels good to have the
[33:45] church full.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; It feels good. I know that we're even
[33:49] missing people, but boy, it feels good
[33:51] to have so many people in the audience,
[33:53] loved ones. Doesn't it feel good,
[33:54] brother Lionel, just to come to a place
[33:57] that you feel at home? It's like this is
[33:58] your family. These people love me.
[34:01] That's how all of us can come into this
[34:03] place and know that this is a place of
[34:05] refuge. It's a place that we can pray
[34:08] for each other, that we can get
[34:10] encouraged, that we can learn from each
[34:12] other's faults, we can learn from each
[34:14] other's successes.
[34:16] And uh there's someone that's been with
[34:17] us for a while now
[34:20] that's going to be leaving us. and she's
[34:24] been a blessing. She's rarely misses a
[34:28] service, but she's moving. Sister Sharon
[34:30] Sorenson,
[34:33] God bless. She's going to be moving.
[34:34] Where are you moving to?
[34:36] &gt;&gt; Missouri.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; Missouri. We're going to miss you. God
[34:40] bless you. Give Sister Sharon a hand. I
[34:41] know most of us.
[34:47] We love you and we hope that you have
[34:50] received something from this
[34:52] congregation that you can take and be a
[34:55] blessing to other people as you go. So,
[34:57] Sister Sharon, may God guide your path,
[35:00] may God bless you and may the Holy
[35:02] Spirit, the same Holy Spirit that is
[35:04] with you here, may that Holy Spirit go
[35:06] before you and may it spread from you to
[35:10] others. And I pray that you find a good
[35:12] church there that that'll love you as
[35:14] much as this church loves you and that
[35:18] will help you and that you'll be happy
[35:22] that that you'll I know you'll be in
[35:23] God's will. Sister Sharon, God bless
[35:25] you. She has one more week with us and I
[35:28] think she's Sister Sharon doesn't miss.
[35:31] I think she's going to have to miss half
[35:32] a service next Sunday, right? Because
[35:35] you got you got to get out.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; See my landlord.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; You got to go see your landlord.
[35:41] All right,
[35:44] God bless you. Um, you know, this
[35:47] church, it does means a lot. And you're
[35:49] going to see as I get through this
[35:51] service, you're going to see that going
[35:54] to church is very, very important.
[35:55] Fellowshipping with each other is very,
[35:58] very important. And, and praying for one
[36:00] another is what's God's way. He wants us
[36:05] to do it.
[36:06] Brother Manny sent me a a picture of his
[36:09] niece that we've been praying for. And
[36:12] many of you, a few of you have contacted
[36:14] me and said, "Hey, what about this this
[36:16] little girl that was attacked by the
[36:17] pitbull that was mauled and had all all
[36:20] of the stitches?" And I know that it's
[36:22] been on some of your hearts to pray for
[36:25] this young lady. Brother Manny sent me a
[36:27] picture earlier today and she's doing
[36:30] really, really good. Healing quickly.
[36:33] &gt;&gt; Little Anastasia. Our
[36:42] prayers are important, friends. It's
[36:45] important that we stand together. It's
[36:47] what Jesus wants us to do.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; He likes us to grab each other arm in
[36:52] arm and bring all of our weaknesses and
[36:55] bring all of our strengths and together
[36:57] we form this body of Christ. And boy, I
[37:01] am so thankful that I get to be part of
[37:04] this. He It's just good, man. It's good
[37:07] to be associated with each each person.
[37:10] It's I just I just feel so good. I know
[37:13] that we all have weaknesses as I do, but
[37:17] we also all have strengths and we all
[37:19] have gifts. And when we come into church
[37:23] together, we are collectively bringing
[37:25] those strengths into church with us. It
[37:28] makes us stronger.
[37:30] This Matthew chapter 5, we're continuing
[37:33] on with the sermon on the mount. Jesus,
[37:36] now when the sermon on the mount starts,
[37:39] Jesus, he really, he gathers his
[37:41] disciples together. There's a lot of
[37:43] people there, but Jesus really is
[37:45] speaking to his disciples in this. And
[37:48] the way of having church back then is
[37:53] the minister, he sat down
[37:57] and then everybody else stood around
[37:59] him. You don't want to do that. I'm just
[38:03] kidding. I would like that.
[38:07] But that's that's the way that they did
[38:09] it back then. And that's where Jesus, he
[38:10] sat down and and the other were others
[38:14] were standing and he preached this
[38:17] sermon on the mount. It was his first
[38:20] public recorded sermon. He had already
[38:22] been preaching healing the sick and he
[38:25] had already been preaching repent for
[38:27] the kingdom of heaven is at hand. But
[38:29] this is the first one that we have
[38:32] recorded is this sermon on the mount. It
[38:34] was preached on the shores of the Sea of
[38:37] Galilee, probably on the north side, a
[38:41] beautiful grassy area there where where
[38:43] people could gather around and enjoy it.
[38:47] Matthew 5 27
[38:51] says this
[38:54] says Jesus is continuing on the sermon.
[38:56] He says, "You have heard that it was
[38:58] said of them of old time, thou shalt not
[39:00] commit adultery." And when he says that
[39:02] you have heard, he's referring to
[39:05] doctrines that come from the law, that
[39:09] come from the Old Testament. So when he
[39:12] says you have heard,
[39:14] he's he's
[39:16] addressing doctrines that are in the
[39:19] church that come from the scriptures.
[39:21] But I say unto you that whosoever lookth
[39:24] on a woman to lust after her has
[39:26] committed adultery with her already in
[39:28] his heart. We went over this last week
[39:30] that Jesus works on the heart of a
[39:32] person. He doesn't want,
[39:35] the Old Testament,
[39:38] it really the law and legalism brings
[39:41] sin. It allows force sin because what it
[39:44] does is if this is the cliff right here
[39:46] of adultery, the Old Testament allowed
[39:49] you to walk right up to that cliff and
[39:53] as long as you didn't commit the act,
[39:55] you were not sinning. Well, Jesus says
[39:56] that is not good enough. He wanted to
[39:59] work on the very inside of the person so
[40:02] that you don't even get close and the
[40:04] stakes are are very very high.
[40:08] Now, Jesus is going to go further when
[40:11] he says that he says that if you look on
[40:14] a woman and and luster after her,
[40:16] really, you've already committed
[40:17] adultery. You've already done it because
[40:19] you want to do it because you've allowed
[40:21] yourself to go that far. And notice the
[40:25] progression of the sermon. Jesus starts
[40:28] with the biatitudes where he tells us
[40:31] how to become a real believer and and
[40:34] how you really have to see that you're
[40:36] nothing. And that's how it all starts.
[40:37] That's the foundation of becoming a
[40:39] Christian is you have to see that you
[40:41] can't do this yourself.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Blessed are the poor in spirit.
[40:45] And then he goes on and and blessed are
[40:47] they that mourn when you regret your
[40:49] sins. And he goes all the way to, hey,
[40:51] you are the light of the earth, the
[40:53] light of the world. You are the salt of
[40:55] the earth. You are a city placed on a
[40:58] hill so you can be a blessing to others.
[41:02] And he continues on and then he gets to
[41:05] this next part that I am about to read.
[41:08] And it his words. Jesus is not intending
[41:12] his words on these next couple of verses
[41:16] to be taken literally,
[41:18] but he is intending them to be shocking
[41:22] to wake you up and to show you the
[41:25] importance of what he says. Now, Jesus's
[41:28] whole life is about salvation. He wants
[41:32] us to he wants to bring us to heaven
[41:34] with him. He doesn't want to lose us. He
[41:38] wants to spend an eternity with us. So
[41:40] he is he became that sacrificial lamb
[41:44] that would cleanse our sins from us as
[41:47] as it was lined out in the Old Testament
[41:49] when when someone would make an offering
[41:51] for their sins. Jesus came and he was
[41:54] that perfect offering because he was
[41:55] what is called a kinsman redeemer.
[41:59] A lamb can't die for a human being but a
[42:01] human can die for a human. you know,
[42:04] blood for blood, skin for skin. So Jesus
[42:08] came and was that offering, was that
[42:12] salvation,
[42:14] but he also preached, he also preached a
[42:18] message. And in that message, he did
[42:22] everything he could to preach against
[42:25] sin.
[42:27] And he talked about something that isn't
[42:29] talking isn't being talked about by very
[42:33] many
[42:34] really churches like it should. You
[42:37] know, we hear about how
[42:40] much power that you should have or how
[42:42] great that you are or we hear about the
[42:45] bride and we hear about heaven and we
[42:47] hear about just just great things in
[42:50] these encouraging
[42:51] sermons and they're great. They're good
[42:54] to hear. But Jesus actually preached
[42:56] about hell more than he did heaven.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; And he talks about this place called
[43:01] hell. And when we learn about the sermon
[43:05] on the mount, most
[43:09] ministers, mainstream ministers, they're
[43:12] going to talk about, well, here is what
[43:13] Jesus meant. His he he talked about how
[43:17] that you
[43:19] you don't allow the enemy in and you
[43:21] should work on the heart. And he did
[43:23] talk about that, but he also talked
[43:25] about hell.
[43:27] And it's a very real thing. Jesus's
[43:30] ministry is not all butterflies and
[43:32] daisies.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; It's corrective.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; And Jesus was doing, like I said, his
[43:38] whole life was keeping us out of hell
[43:40] and bringing us to heaven. And he was
[43:42] the sacrificial lamb. He died for our
[43:44] sins. But he also preached to us saying,
[43:48] "Don't get close.
[43:50] Stay away from sin because it will lead
[43:54] you to hell.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; We can't forget that.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; If Jesus preached it, if the Bible says
[44:01] it, it's true. And we don't just skim
[44:05] over
[44:06] &gt;&gt; hell because it is there.
[44:09] Now, watch how serious Jesus is about
[44:12] telling us not to sin.
[44:16] Verse number 29
[44:18] says this. And if thy right hand offend
[44:22] thee, again that doesn't mean offend
[44:24] like your own hand. I saw this video
[44:27] that this dog and it was sitting on this
[44:30] couch and it saw its own tail wagging
[44:34] and it and it bites its tail
[44:37] and then it starts freaking out and
[44:40] biting itself. That's that's not what
[44:43] the scripture is talking about here.
[44:45] Your own hand or your own eye doesn't
[44:47] offend you.
[44:50] It causes you to sin is what Jesus is
[44:53] saying.
[44:55] And if thy right hand offend thee, pluck
[44:58] it out
[44:59] and cast it from thee. For it is
[45:03] profitable for thee that one of thy
[45:06] members should perish and not that thy
[45:08] whole body should be cast into hell.
[45:11] English Standard Version very to the
[45:13] point translation says so if your eye
[45:17] even your good eye almost all the
[45:19] translations say that if your eye even
[45:22] your good eye causes you to lust gouge
[45:26] it out and throw it away it is better
[45:29] for you to lose one part of your body
[45:32] then your whole body be thrown into hell
[45:36] hell's part of this that's how ser
[45:39] serious Jesus is about sin. He's not
[45:43] telling us
[45:45] to literally cut our eye out in this.
[45:50] He's saying, and he's not just saying to
[45:53] cut out your right eye. So, you can't
[45:56] cover your right eye and look at
[45:58] pornography with your left eye. That's
[46:00] that's not what he's saying. He's using
[46:03] the right eye for a purpose.
[46:07] Let me read to you something. This comes
[46:10] from web WebMD
[46:13] a medical website says this. What is the
[46:16] dominant eye?
[46:19] The dominant eye is the eye your brain
[46:22] favors.
[46:24] Just like you rely on one hand more than
[46:28] the other, your brain relies on one eye
[46:31] more than the other. When you look at
[46:34] something, your brain gets visual
[46:36] information from that eye. while it
[46:39] suppresses visual information from your
[46:42] other eye. Most people have a dominant
[46:44] eye that corresponds to their dominant
[46:47] hand. So, right eye dominance. How many
[46:50] people here are left-handed?
[46:54] One, two.
[46:57] It's about 10%.
[47:00] Is left-handed.
[47:03] Right eye dominance means that your
[47:04] brain relies more heavily on your right
[47:06] eye to process visual input because most
[47:09] people are right-handed. The right eye
[47:12] dominance is more common than the other
[47:15] types. Okay. So the right hand, the
[47:19] right eye is going to be the theme for
[47:23] the next few verses of of this of this
[47:26] sermon. And it's also all throughout
[47:28] Jesus's ministry when he talks about the
[47:31] right hand, the right side, the right
[47:33] eye. So around 90% of the world is
[47:36] right-handed. Most of the people that we
[47:39] know are right-handed. So Jesus says
[47:41] that he's generally speaking and he's
[47:45] saying that
[47:48] these are the more dominant influences
[47:51] in your life. Okay? So when he's talking
[47:54] about your right eye,
[47:57] it's the more dominant force in your
[48:00] life. When he's talking about your right
[48:01] hand, it's your your right arm. It's
[48:03] it's stronger. It's more dominant. And
[48:07] Jesus is saying that you have to
[48:09] overcome that
[48:11] that dominating force that's in your
[48:13] life, you have to overcome it. And he's
[48:17] not saying that you just, you know, you
[48:19] you take a spoon and pop your eyeball
[48:22] out and and and throw it away. That's
[48:24] not that's not that's that's not what
[48:26] he's saying. And he's he's not saying
[48:28] that that you cut out your tongue if you
[48:31] have a problem with gossiping
[48:33] because what would happen is you would
[48:35] get on social media
[48:38] and you'd continue on.
[48:41] If you pop out your right eye and you
[48:42] have a tr trouble with lust, you'll just
[48:45] look through the left eye. That's not
[48:47] what he's saying. If you poke them both
[48:49] out, you're gonna still find some way to
[48:52] sin. And he's he's attacking the sin.
[48:56] He's attacking the problem at the very
[48:58] source. And he's saying that you need to
[49:02] cut it out. Whatever that sin is,
[49:05] whatever is causing you to sin, cut it
[49:07] out of your life.
[49:09] 1 Corinthians chapter 10 verse 13. You
[49:12] might say, "Well, I can't do it.
[49:15] This this problem that I have is so
[49:18] strong, is is so dominant with me. I
[49:20] just can't overcome it." 1 Corinthians
[49:22] chapter 10:13, I'll read the New King
[49:24] James version. It says this, "No
[49:27] temptation has overtaken you except such
[49:30] as is common to man."
[49:34] So, you're struggling with something.
[49:37] You're not the only one that's ever
[49:38] struggled with this. There are other
[49:40] people that are struggling. And
[49:42] sometimes the Lord will allow us to
[49:44] struggle with something. Sometimes the
[49:46] Lord will allow us to fail. So then we
[49:49] can take our failures and we can be a
[49:51] strength to someone else. And we can
[49:54] say, you know, brother, I was there.
[49:57] Here's here's how I did it. Here's how I
[49:59] overcame it. And here's how bad I I got.
[50:02] Brother Michael when when he when he
[50:04] prayed he said that cigarette spirit's a
[50:07] hard spirit or or some something to that
[50:10] effect and many of you know who have
[50:13] overcome
[50:14] addiction to nicotine. It's rough
[50:18] but you can say I did it. I overcame it.
[50:21] Here's how I do it. I I did it. Now I
[50:24] have a burden for you and I can pray for
[50:25] you. No temptation has overtaken you
[50:28] except such as is common to man. But God
[50:30] is faithful, who will not allow you to
[50:33] be tempted beyond what you are able.
[50:37] You can overcome. He's not going to
[50:40] allow a temptation to come upon you that
[50:42] you cannot overcome. I don't care what
[50:44] anybody says,
[50:46] you can overcome it. Resist the devil
[50:48] and he will flee from you. Fight, fight,
[50:51] fight, fight. Keep going, keep working
[50:53] and then you'll eventually overcome. And
[50:55] listen to this next next um sentence. He
[50:58] says, "But with the temptation will also
[51:01] but with the temptation that he will
[51:04] also make a way of escape that you may
[51:06] be able to bear it." So we get to the
[51:09] point I can't overcome it. I'm
[51:10] struggling Lord. I'm doing everything
[51:12] that I can. I just I can't do it myself
[51:15] and and but the Bible says that I can't
[51:17] overcome it. So I'm going to work and
[51:18] I'm going to work and I'm going to work
[51:20] and then all of a sudden God will step
[51:22] in
[51:24] and make a way of escape for you.
[51:27] the scriptures according to the apostle
[51:29] Paul. So if Paul is saying that if the
[51:32] dominant force in your life
[51:35] whatever that dominant force is that is
[51:37] in your life that it is possible to
[51:40] overcome it and then God makes a way of
[51:43] escaping that
[51:46] and I always say it's not what you don't
[51:48] do for God that matters. Cutting these
[51:53] things out
[51:55] are not
[51:59] they're not a necessity necessarily to
[52:01] see to serve God, but
[52:06] these things according to Jesus
[52:10] can lead you to hell.
[52:13] So, we're serving God, but then we have
[52:16] a weakness here. And and Jesus is
[52:19] saying, "Hey, if you don't overcome that
[52:20] weakness, you have a chance of going to
[52:21] hell. It's very real. And I want this
[52:25] church." And then God says, or Paul says
[52:28] that God God will provide a way of
[52:30] escape. And I want this church to be a
[52:32] way of escape
[52:34] for strength for the others for for to
[52:38] help other people. If you have a
[52:40] problem, come in here. We'll help you.
[52:42] The Lord Jesus will pray for you. We
[52:45] will pray for you. The Lord Jesus will
[52:46] help you. This can be a way of escape.
[52:49] You personally can be a way of escape
[52:51] for someone else.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; All of this working together and we have
[52:56] plenty of problems. Friends, we have
[52:58] plenty of problems in this church. But
[53:00] let this church be a place of correction
[53:04] where you can receive correction and a
[53:06] place where you can overcome.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Back to ma back to Matthew 5 29.
[53:13] And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck
[53:16] it out and cast it from thee. For it is
[53:17] profitable
[53:19] for thee that one of thy members should
[53:21] perish, and not that thy whole body
[53:22] should be cast into hell.
[53:26] If thy right hand offend thee, cut it
[53:28] off, and cast it from thee. For for it
[53:30] is profitable for thee that one of thy
[53:33] members should perish, and not that thy
[53:35] whole body should be cast into hell.
[53:39] We are born
[53:41] with weakness to sin. All of us notice
[53:44] how some people will steal,
[53:47] some people will gossip,
[53:49] some people will constantly struggle
[53:51] with saying negative things, some people
[53:53] lust, some struggle with homosexuality,
[53:57] some people lie,
[53:59] some can't control their tempers. You
[54:02] know, some struggle with drug abuse and
[54:04] substance abuse. Some people struggle
[54:06] really with religious extremism
[54:10] where they constantly have to have that
[54:12] supply. They constantly have to have new
[54:14] prophecy and and and and some sort of
[54:17] spiritual thing and then when it doesn't
[54:19] happen or or the prophet is the
[54:22] prophetic gift that they think is there
[54:24] is proven wrong, then they just go to
[54:26] the next one. It's a weakness.
[54:29] Jesus warned us many times of false
[54:30] prophets that would arise. Why would he
[54:32] say that? It's because many people have
[54:34] a weakness for that. Some people
[54:37] struggle with depression,
[54:41] struggle with with they they get down
[54:44] and they just can't get up. And and the
[54:46] enemy, he's going to hit you wherever
[54:48] your weakness is and he knows it.
[54:49] There's a in all of our armor.
[54:51] There's a hole and he can take that
[54:53] knife and he can jab it in that hole and
[54:55] we're supposed to cover that spot. And
[54:57] Jesus is saying if that spot that you
[55:00] have,
[55:02] he said cut it off. He says if you have
[55:05] a weakness for depression, whatever it
[55:07] might be, overcome it. Because what
[55:10] happens if you succumb to that? If you
[55:13] give in to that, then who suffers? You
[55:15] suffer. Your spouse suffers. Your
[55:18] children suffer. Your parents suffer.
[55:21] Your church suffers. Everyone suffers
[55:24] when one person is sinning. Whether it
[55:26] be depression or whether it be
[55:30] substance abuse, lust, or whatever it
[55:32] is, it's not just you that suffers. It's
[55:35] everyone. And Jesus is saying, "Cut that
[55:38] out."
[55:40] And I named a lot of a lot of problems.
[55:42] You might say that, "Well, I don't have
[55:44] any of those problems."
[55:45] Self-righteousness is another one.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; It's another one that we suffer with
[55:51] that people suffer with. That's the one
[55:54] that Jesus had the most trouble with to
[55:56] tell you the truth. So all of us are
[55:59] there and he said cast it away.
[56:04] So if there's something whatever that
[56:06] dominating force is I said if you're
[56:09] right-handed he says if your right hand
[56:11] is is causing you to sin cut it off. If
[56:15] if your right eye he said pluck it out.
[56:18] And then he said this. He says, "And
[56:22] cast it away.
[56:24] Get rid of it."
[56:26] So, you know, again, he's not saying
[56:29] that pop out your eye, you know, and
[56:32] throw throw it away. Guy following you
[56:35] is like, "Oh, dude, you dropped your
[56:36] eyeball.
[56:38] Pick it up." No,
[56:40] throw it all away. Get rid of it all.
[56:45] Jesus. That's why I said we we see that
[56:47] that he's he says cut off your hand or
[56:49] or pluck out your eye or whatever.
[56:51] That's how important it is. He's very
[56:53] serious. Get rid of it. But he says
[56:56] throw it away. Don't even let it come
[56:58] back into your mind. If you struggle
[57:00] with a sin, whatever that sin may be,
[57:03] you may have overcome it. But don't let
[57:05] it stay in your mind.
[57:09] Don't let that weakness abide there.
[57:13] Don't still desire that. Don't let it
[57:16] sit in your mind. Get rid of it.
[57:19] Ecclesiastes 7 says, "Do not say, why
[57:24] were the old days better than these?
[57:28] For it is not wise to ask such
[57:30] questions.
[57:32] Don't look back on your past fondly when
[57:36] you have made mistakes and still desire
[57:39] that and and you may still be able to
[57:41] overcome it but that sin is still there.
[57:45] If you're looking back and a friend of
[57:47] mine, close friend that I I grew up
[57:51] with, his dad
[57:54] was always talking about, I mean, a
[57:56] believer, family,
[57:59] always talking about how he used to
[58:01] party when he was young. Man, he could
[58:03] he could drink and he used to go to the
[58:05] bars and get in get in fights and boy, I
[58:08] was rough. And he was constantly telling
[58:10] his kids how rough he was.
[58:14] and he said it in a way that glorified
[58:17] it
[58:18] even though he wasn't doing that
[58:20] anymore. And of course, what was the
[58:22] first thing that the kids did? They got
[58:25] they got mixed up. They started as soon
[58:27] as they could get a hold of a beer. I'm
[58:29] going to be like, "Dad, and they started
[58:31] drinking and and uh two of the three
[58:34] boys became alcoholics.
[58:37] Rough. One of them one of them died from
[58:40] it." And these are friends that I grew
[58:42] up with. And I saw that the dad was
[58:44] constantly he was constantly saying how
[58:46] rough he was and how bad he was. And
[58:48] yes, the Lord got a hold of me, but he
[58:50] still lifted up those those past sins.
[58:53] Jesus is saying those past sins, get rid
[58:55] of them, bury them, cast them away from
[58:58] you. Don't go back to them. Let them
[59:01] die. And Ecclesiastes is saying, hey,
[59:04] don't say, "Oh, that was the good old
[59:06] days." No, these are the good days.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; This is when you're serving the Lord.
[59:12] This is when the Lord has given you joy.
[59:14] It's not your past sins. Now is the good
[59:18] time. Now is the best time. And if
[59:21] you're looking in the past and saying,
[59:22] "Well, I used to be better." Then
[59:24] there's something wrong with the
[59:25] present.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; You need to get better now.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; And you need to have that joy. These are
[59:32] the best days right now. Not yesterday,
[59:37] not 1950, not 2,000 years ago. Now,
[59:43] &gt;&gt; we live in the here and now.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; He's telling throw this stuff away and
[59:50] not reminiscing about your previous
[59:53] weaknesses and and the way that you used
[59:55] to struggle and get rid of it.
[1:00:00] Pluck it out. Cut it off. And you can't,
[1:00:04] as I said, it's not what you don't do
[1:00:08] for God that matters. Don't cut off your
[1:00:11] hand. It's like, okay, the hand's gone.
[1:00:14] Well, I'm send with this one. You know,
[1:00:17] it's like, oh, hey, Dan, you're missing
[1:00:19] both hands. It's like, yeah, I I send
[1:00:22] with this one, too. And then the next
[1:00:24] one, okay, well, I'm missing this part
[1:00:25] and that part. No eyes. No, you you
[1:00:28] can't you can't just keep cutting
[1:00:30] everything off. You cut the sin off.
[1:00:33] People say that they struggle
[1:00:36] with the phone.
[1:00:39] You can get rid of the phone and that's
[1:00:41] good. Nothing wrong with that.
[1:00:45] But get to the root of it.
[1:00:48] You're just going to get it back. It's
[1:00:50] just going to come back. Get to the root
[1:00:53] of what you're struggling with. And if
[1:00:55] you have to get rid of the phone for a
[1:00:56] while to to get to that point, then go
[1:00:58] ahead. But it's not cutting off the
[1:01:00] phone. It's working on the heart. That's
[1:01:03] where the sin is coming from. It's
[1:01:04] coming from the out and it's just
[1:01:06] manifesting itself in the phone or it's
[1:01:08] just manifesting itself in the temper or
[1:01:10] it's just manifesting the cell itself in
[1:01:12] the lust. That's just the manifestation.
[1:01:14] Jesus again, he's saying get rid of it.
[1:01:17] Get rid of the source of this. Get rid
[1:01:19] of what is influencing you. The right
[1:01:21] hand, the dominant force in your life.
[1:01:24] Get rid of it.
[1:01:26] and then you can move forward.
[1:01:30] One thing I I love
[1:01:33] about um
[1:01:37] going through verse by f verse in the
[1:01:40] scriptures the way that I teach. I I
[1:01:43] I'll take a chapter or I'll take a book
[1:01:47] and then we'll go through it. But one
[1:01:50] thing that makes it a little difficult
[1:01:52] is that you're going through verse by
[1:01:55] verse and you're commenting and you're
[1:01:57] expounding on these things and then you
[1:01:59] get to something that is very very
[1:02:01] difficult.
[1:02:03] You can't hopcotch over it. You got to
[1:02:07] address it. And that's how this next
[1:02:09] verse that Jesus is talking about is
[1:02:12] most a lot of ministers, a lot of
[1:02:15] churches, they just kind of set it
[1:02:17] aside. But it's something that needs to
[1:02:20] be addressed. And it's not something
[1:02:22] that you can just
[1:02:26] give a black and white answer to. And
[1:02:28] everybody wants a black and white
[1:02:29] answer. You can't give a black and white
[1:02:32] answer to the subject of divorce.
[1:02:35] It is something that's in our society
[1:02:39] and has been really for the beginning of
[1:02:41] time. God created man and woman and he
[1:02:45] wanted them to be together
[1:02:47] and he wanted them to be monogamous.
[1:02:51] And we know that the writings of Moses
[1:02:55] in the Old Testament
[1:02:57] that
[1:02:59] he made he wrote an actual writing of
[1:03:03] being able to divorce. Let's read it.
[1:03:09] When we get to when we get to divorce,
[1:03:13] you always hear, "Well, irreconcilable
[1:03:15] differences." And then they they you
[1:03:17] know, the divorce. If you are married or
[1:03:21] plan on getting married, you will have
[1:03:23] irreconcilable differences.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Can I get a witness?
[1:03:32] You will. There are things in your
[1:03:35] marriage that you will never come to
[1:03:39] perfect agreement on. It's just part of
[1:03:42] being married.
[1:03:44] But you that's not grounds for divorce.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; There are very very few. Jesus gives
[1:03:51] really only one
[1:03:53] grounds for divorce when he says this.
[1:03:56] Irreconcilable differences are not
[1:03:58] those. Religion
[1:04:01] is not one of those.
[1:04:05] You cannot agree
[1:04:07] on how you worship. You cannot agree on
[1:04:10] where you fellowship. But it is not
[1:04:13] grounds for divorce,
[1:04:18] constant bickering.
[1:04:21] It's not there.
[1:04:23] You got to get over it.
[1:04:26] Money problems.
[1:04:29] You got to get over it.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Now, there may be reason for separation
[1:04:36] if there's some sort of danger maybe in
[1:04:39] the household or something like that and
[1:04:41] and I understand that,
[1:04:44] but you have to be careful in taking
[1:04:46] that past to the divorce.
[1:04:50] If you've already maybe and there's lots
[1:04:53] of I know there's a lot of people here
[1:04:55] that have already made that mistake of
[1:04:57] being married and divorced and remarried
[1:05:00] and if you have already made that
[1:05:03] mistake the best advice and I think is
[1:05:07] what Jesus is saying is
[1:05:10] take what you the mistakes that you've
[1:05:12] made and now turn them into a blessing
[1:05:15] to someone else. Help someone else.
[1:05:17] You've made the mistake. You're in the
[1:05:19] place that you are now. Make the most of
[1:05:22] it. All of us have sinned. All of us
[1:05:24] have done things that we regret. Now,
[1:05:26] where you at right now, start right now.
[1:05:28] As I said, this is the best time right
[1:05:30] now. You can look in the past and and
[1:05:33] you can see all of your failures, but
[1:05:35] you are where you are. You are where you
[1:05:38] are at now. Brother Brandham said it
[1:05:41] beautifully. He said this, speaking of
[1:05:44] people that had been divorced and
[1:05:47] remarried,
[1:05:49] he said, "If you're happy with her, live
[1:05:51] with her. Raise your children in an
[1:05:53] admonition of God.
[1:05:56] But God be merciful to you if you ever
[1:05:58] do that thing again."
[1:06:01] You teach your children to never do a
[1:06:04] thing like that. Bring them up in the
[1:06:07] admonition of God.
[1:06:09] And it's the same spirit that Jesus
[1:06:12] taught taught. He said, listen, when
[1:06:15] he's talking about marriage in in
[1:06:17] Matthew chapter 19, I don't think that
[1:06:19] we'll get there, but in Matthew chapter
[1:06:21] 19, he talked about these requirements
[1:06:23] for marriage and for divorce. And then
[1:06:25] the disciples like, well, none of us
[1:06:26] should get married.
[1:06:28] No. No. But it is very I mean yes you
[1:06:33] should get married but it is very
[1:06:36] serious
[1:06:38] approaching marriage and you young
[1:06:40] people
[1:06:42] it should be the most serious thing that
[1:06:45] you ever do in your life is approach
[1:06:49] that marriage ceremony.
[1:06:54] Jesus said your names are of hell.
[1:06:57] You got to be careful.
[1:07:00] Marriage should be approached with the
[1:07:02] utmost caution. You should be 100% sure.
[1:07:06] And love between two people is not the
[1:07:11] only thing that matters.
[1:07:13] All right? I don't care how much you
[1:07:15] love her. I don't care how much you love
[1:07:17] him. Love is an emotion that you feel.
[1:07:21] But there is a deeper thing in your life
[1:07:24] than just how much you love that person
[1:07:26] right now. That love could fade. But if
[1:07:30] you find the right one that God has
[1:07:32] ordained for you, it will never fade.
[1:07:34] You will always be able to reconcile.
[1:07:37] You'll always be able to get past those
[1:07:39] things. But I see so many people, oh, we
[1:07:41] finish each other's sentences. We're so
[1:07:43] great. Yeah, I understand.
[1:07:45] But just wait.
[1:07:48] Make sure.
[1:07:50] And we we want to be together all the
[1:07:51] time. I understand. But make sure we see
[1:07:55] things exactly the same on everything.
[1:07:57] That happens all of us when I don't
[1:08:00] think there's probably been except a
[1:08:02] gold digger maybe. I don't think there's
[1:08:04] ever been someone who has approached
[1:08:08] marriage with the idea that it was going
[1:08:10] to fail or with the want of it failing.
[1:08:14] We all have approached marriage, whether
[1:08:16] it's successful or unsuccessful, with
[1:08:19] the idea that this is going to work. I'm
[1:08:22] going to spend the rest of my life with
[1:08:23] this person.
[1:08:25] So remember as you're approaching this
[1:08:28] great decision
[1:08:31] that
[1:08:36] don't let it be about emotion.
[1:08:39] Don't let it just be about love. But
[1:08:42] approach this reverently and prayerfully
[1:08:44] because you run a great risk.
[1:08:48] I know people that I grew up with very
[1:08:50] very close to me that their parents Now
[1:08:54] here's where legalism fails.
[1:08:56] their parents.
[1:08:59] One of them was divorced when they were
[1:09:01] younger
[1:09:03] and their parents were living together.
[1:09:06] Didn't tell anybody anybody out of holy
[1:09:08] wedlock for decades
[1:09:11] and not making that decision to get
[1:09:14] married
[1:09:16] because
[1:09:18] one of them was divorced. Now these are
[1:09:21] people these are very very close to me
[1:09:22] that I grew up with. They lived out
[1:09:25] their lives and the parents died and
[1:09:27] they were never married. They had a
[1:09:28] bunch of children. They had they they
[1:09:30] had a whole family but they were never
[1:09:33] living in holy wedlock. Do you see where
[1:09:35] where illegalism is failure? No. You are
[1:09:40] living together. Get married or live
[1:09:43] single. But don't be in that no man's
[1:09:46] land. That's not the place to be.
[1:09:49] make that decision and then go with it
[1:09:52] and stay with it.
[1:09:56] These are I know these things are not
[1:09:58] they're hard things to say but it just
[1:10:00] so happens that that's the next
[1:10:01] scripture. So we are going through mar
[1:10:04] we're going through divorce
[1:10:08] like I said that you can have
[1:10:10] irreconcilable differences we all do.
[1:10:14] It's you got you got to get through it
[1:10:15] and the best way to get through it is to
[1:10:17] be a Christian.
[1:10:19] And that's the best way to get through
[1:10:20] everything. Let me read some stats
[1:10:24] stats on marriage. Listen to this.
[1:10:28] The divorce rate for first marriages is
[1:10:30] 41% in the United States.
[1:10:33] Right? I thought I actually thought it
[1:10:34] was going to be a little bit higher.
[1:10:37] Divorce rate for first marriages is 41%.
[1:10:39] Second marriages is 63%.
[1:10:42] So no, the grass isn't greener on the
[1:10:44] other side. It's not going to the second
[1:10:46] one. Oh, I'm going to get it right this
[1:10:47] time. No, you usually won't. 63% on
[1:10:51] second marriages, over 70% failure on
[1:10:54] third marriages
[1:10:56] in the United States.
[1:10:59] Obviously, you're better off making that
[1:11:00] first marriage work. Divorce rates among
[1:11:03] Protestant Christians, listen to this,
[1:11:06] 51%.
[1:11:08] National average, 41%.
[1:11:12] Divorce rate among Protestant Christians
[1:11:14] is 51%. Why? That doesn't make sense,
[1:11:18] does it? It does make sense.
[1:11:22] Protestant Christians when they do when
[1:11:25] they did the poll, they are saying, "Oh,
[1:11:27] I am a Christian." But they are not
[1:11:30] practicing Christians.
[1:11:32] They are just identifying as a
[1:11:34] Christian, but they are not actually
[1:11:37] being a Christian. They're not attending
[1:11:39] a church. They're not reading their
[1:11:40] Bible with their family. They are just
[1:11:43] just claiming to be a Christian. You are
[1:11:46] better off not to claim Christianity and
[1:11:50] get married than if you claim
[1:11:51] Christianity and get married. The the
[1:11:54] atheist has a better success rate than
[1:11:57] the ones that just claim it and don't
[1:11:59] practice it.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Very interesting.
[1:12:05] A practicing evangelical Christian
[1:12:08] divorce rate is about 28%.
[1:12:11] 41% national average. practicing
[1:12:14] evangelical Christians about 28% these
[1:12:17] are non-denominational Christians. This
[1:12:19] is the biggest non-atholic group in the
[1:12:21] United States. This is like the uh the
[1:12:24] everything from what we would be
[1:12:26] considered that all the way up to the
[1:12:28] big mega churches.
[1:12:30] Practicing Catholics
[1:12:33] 28% with uh evangelical Christians
[1:12:37] practicing Catholics 19%.
[1:12:40] Going down. That's that's half less than
[1:12:44] half of the national average. It's
[1:12:46] because Catholics actively teach that
[1:12:48] divorce is wrong. A lot of evangelical
[1:12:51] churches, a lot of mainstream Christian
[1:12:53] churches don't teach that. Catholics do
[1:12:55] teach that
[1:12:57] and they're part they're actively part
[1:13:00] of that church. They're practicing.
[1:13:01] Mormons and Jehovah Witnesses 9%.
[1:13:06] Again, it's because that those churches
[1:13:09] teach divorce is wrong. If you grew up
[1:13:12] in that church, Mormon or Jehovah
[1:13:14] Witness or Catholic or whatever it was,
[1:13:16] it was the the minister taught you that
[1:13:19] it was wrong to divorce and that you
[1:13:22] should take this marriage vow seriously.
[1:13:25] That's why I am saying it.
[1:13:29] Take these vows seriously. Being part of
[1:13:33] a church helps your marriage.
[1:13:37] helps your marriage tremendously
[1:13:40] because now it's not just you. You've
[1:13:44] got a whole community here that is
[1:13:45] behind you and supporting you and trying
[1:13:48] to help you and and not only would it
[1:13:51] hurt would it hurt just the couple if
[1:13:53] they get divorced but now you this
[1:13:55] spreads like I said that a sin will
[1:13:57] spread divorce spreads now the parents
[1:13:59] have to take care of the grandkids
[1:14:02] when the when the husband and wife split
[1:14:04] up it puts a burden on them the kids
[1:14:08] imagine the kids and how they feel when
[1:14:10] mom and dad aren't talking and fighting
[1:14:12] all the time And there's new people
[1:14:15] introduced in this situation. It is an
[1:14:17] awful, awful thing.
[1:14:20] You say, you might say, "Well, pastor,
[1:14:22] you're just trying to get people to go
[1:14:23] to church."
[1:14:28] I am
[1:14:30] because it helps.
[1:14:32] It's good for you. It's good for you to
[1:14:36] get up on Sunday morning and make the
[1:14:38] effort to come to church. It will help
[1:14:40] you. and Sunday night and Wednesday
[1:14:44] night. It helps
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; a practicing Christian,
[1:14:50] their marriage is better because the
[1:14:53] husband and the wife are together. And
[1:14:56] there may be times when you have a
[1:14:59] believing husband and unbelieving wife
[1:15:02] or or the other way around.
[1:15:04] And the Apostle Paul said, "No, don't
[1:15:06] don't split up if you have that."
[1:15:08] Because you
[1:15:11] can lead that spouse to the Lord.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Because of your Christian way, because
[1:15:18] of the way that you act, you can be an
[1:15:21] influence on that husband or that wife's
[1:15:23] life and lead them to God.
[1:15:30] Now
[1:15:32] we need to understand the environment
[1:15:35] that Jesus is teaching in when he says
[1:15:37] this. Uh you know Jesus's words they
[1:15:41] they are eternally they they're just
[1:15:44] they're perfect.
[1:15:46] And Jesus is talking about when he says
[1:15:50] that um it has been said
[1:15:54] here's where it's said. New King James
[1:15:56] Version, Deuteronomy 24:1, if you could
[1:15:58] put it up there. Deuter Deuteronomy 24:1
[1:16:01] says this, "When a man takes a wife and
[1:16:03] marries her and happens that she finds
[1:16:05] no favor in his eyes because he has
[1:16:07] found some uncleanness or indecency in
[1:16:11] her and writes her a certificate of
[1:16:13] divorce, puts it in her hand, and sends
[1:16:15] her out of his house when she has
[1:16:17] departed from his house and goes and
[1:16:19] becomes another man's wife. If the la if
[1:16:22] the latter husband detests her and
[1:16:25] writes her a certificate of divorce,
[1:16:28] puts it in her hand and sends her out of
[1:16:31] the house. Or if the latter husband
[1:16:33] dies, who took her as a wife, then the
[1:16:36] former husband who divorced her must not
[1:16:38] take her back because take her back to
[1:16:42] be his wife after she has been defiled.
[1:16:45] For that is an abomination before the
[1:16:47] Lord. and you shall not bring sin on the
[1:16:50] land which the Lord your God has given
[1:16:52] you as an inheritance.
[1:16:55] There's a whole lot
[1:16:58] in that writing from Moses. Jeremiah
[1:17:02] quoted that writing. Isaiah quoted that
[1:17:05] writing and even the the scribes and the
[1:17:07] Pharisees are going to quote this to
[1:17:08] Jesus later on in Matthew chapter 19. So
[1:17:11] Moses covers a whole lot. He says you if
[1:17:13] you he says that you can divorce your
[1:17:15] wife because of this this and this and
[1:17:17] this. And really what Moses was
[1:17:19] describing back then was just a normal
[1:17:23] modern day divorce.
[1:17:25] And Jesus is like no.
[1:17:28] No, you don't do that.
[1:17:31] Jesus
[1:17:32] remember how he raised the bar with
[1:17:34] adultery,
[1:17:36] how he raised the bar with murder. Now
[1:17:38] he's raising the bar with divorce.
[1:17:43] Now there were two schools of thought in
[1:17:47] that day and like religion in general
[1:17:51] they had taken what Moses's Moses wrote
[1:17:54] and they had interpreted and
[1:17:56] reinterpreted and preached on this way
[1:17:58] and preached on that way and justified
[1:18:00] doing what they were doing and and and
[1:18:02] all of this morphed into when Jesus was
[1:18:06] at was there I don't know was it was a
[1:18:08] thousand years later or whatever it was
[1:18:10] from Moses to Jesus. Jesus was there and
[1:18:13] there were two main schools of thought
[1:18:15] at that day
[1:18:17] and there were these two main rabbis.
[1:18:20] One was very liberal and one was very
[1:18:22] conservative. This man Hel had the
[1:18:24] liberal liberal interpretation
[1:18:27] and he said basically a man could
[1:18:29] divorce his wife for any reason. Back
[1:18:31] then the women the society of that day
[1:18:33] the women didn't have rights. It's
[1:18:35] obviously changed now, but back then the
[1:18:39] only person that had the rights and the
[1:18:40] ability to do it was the man. So this
[1:18:42] man hel
[1:18:44] that he said he said that you could
[1:18:46] divorce your wife for any reason and
[1:18:49] even said that if she burned your dinner
[1:18:53] you could divorce her
[1:18:56] very very it's like whatever you want if
[1:18:58] you don't like her you can divorce her.
[1:19:00] And then there was this the other school
[1:19:02] of thought with this was this man named
[1:19:04] Shamai and he was encou he was
[1:19:06] conservative interpretation that divorce
[1:19:08] was only permissible in cases of sexual
[1:19:11] immorality.
[1:19:12] Maybe she didn't disclose that she
[1:19:14] wasn't a virgin before they got married
[1:19:17] or that there were sexual improprieties
[1:19:19] during the marriage. So you have two ve
[1:19:22] liberal school of thought and one very
[1:19:24] one conservative school of thought.
[1:19:27] And uh
[1:19:29] remember
[1:19:31] when Jesus is talking about divorce, and
[1:19:33] this is very important.
[1:19:36] He may say it's permissible,
[1:19:39] but he doesn't say it's encouraged.
[1:19:42] So maybe that
[1:19:45] someone could find a rule why they could
[1:19:48] divorce their wife,
[1:19:50] but it's still it doesn't mean that you
[1:19:53] should. All right?
[1:19:56] And Jesus is is saying here and I'm
[1:19:58] running out of time. Let's
[1:20:03] let's let's go back to ma Matthew
[1:20:05] chapter 30 chapter 5 and verse 31 and
[1:20:07] we'll close with this. It has been said
[1:20:10] that whosoever shall put away his wife
[1:20:12] and you know what I'll do I'll continue
[1:20:14] it tonight. How's that because I I I
[1:20:17] skipped over a lot of stuff and I want
[1:20:19] to stay on our time. Matthew chapter
[1:20:21] 5:31 says this and Jesus is continuing
[1:20:23] on the sermon on the mount. It has been
[1:20:25] said that whosoever shall put away his
[1:20:27] wife, let him give her a writing of
[1:20:28] divorcement. But I say unto you, that
[1:20:30] whosoever shall put away his wife,
[1:20:33] saving for the cause of fornication,
[1:20:36] causes her to commit adultery, and
[1:20:38] whosoever shall marry her that is
[1:20:40] divorced commits adultery. So Jesus is
[1:20:43] saying, no, that this this liberal way
[1:20:46] of thinking that is not right. Jesus is
[1:20:48] saying, don't divorce.
[1:20:51] Basically, don't do it. And I'll tell
[1:20:54] you, God hates divorce. As I said
[1:20:56] earlier, that it causes problems in the
[1:20:59] family. It causes problems all kinds of
[1:21:02] of everywhere. And when we divorce a
[1:21:05] husband or a wife, then it opens the
[1:21:09] door. And Jesus is trying to get down
[1:21:11] and saying don't do it.
[1:21:14] Don't divorce. Marriage is and the
[1:21:17] worship team can come. Marriage is one
[1:21:19] of the greatest gifts in life to us. God
[1:21:23] married the first two people. He married
[1:21:24] Adam and Eve
[1:21:26] and he saw that life was was good with a
[1:21:29] spouse.
[1:21:31] And if you've made mistakes, then the
[1:21:33] blood of Jesus Christ can cleanse those
[1:21:35] mistakes.
[1:21:36] But you have to know the consequences
[1:21:39] of when you serve yourself, of when you
[1:21:43] sin. And whether that sin is
[1:21:48] lying or stealing or cheating or
[1:21:52] looking at something that you shouldn't
[1:21:53] look at, Jesus is saying it is important
[1:21:56] enough that you would cut off that that
[1:22:00] limb
[1:22:02] than to take that sin with you because
[1:22:06] that sin could lead you to hell. And he
[1:22:08] he talks about lust and he talks about
[1:22:10] many of hating someone. And now he gets
[1:22:15] to all the way into our personal lives
[1:22:17] with our wives and he says, "Do not
[1:22:21] do not let the enemy come in and say
[1:22:25] it's okay just to move on to the next
[1:22:28] one." He says, "Don't do it."
[1:22:30] He says, "You're you're in danger of
[1:22:34] hell. You're in danger of committing
[1:22:36] adultery." And as I said, there's many
[1:22:38] people that have made that mistake. But
[1:22:42] Jesus is for the here and now.
[1:22:46] Right now is what matters. And all you
[1:22:49] you young people and thinking about a
[1:22:51] husband and thinking about a wife,
[1:22:54] take it very very very seriously because
[1:22:58] you can make a really bad decision or
[1:23:01] you can make a great decision. I made a
[1:23:04] good one by the grace of God.
[1:23:06] My wife uh Stephanie's back with
[1:23:09] my daughter uh right now with her baby
[1:23:12] shower. But it's a blessing when you get
[1:23:14] married and when you marry the right
[1:23:16] one, but it's a curse if you marry the
[1:23:19] wrong one. Amen. Daniel, if you could I
[1:23:22] think uh we are going to baptize today.
[1:23:26] So, do we have how many? I I don't see
[1:23:29] one of them that was going to get
[1:23:30] baptized. We still have one. Anybody
[1:23:33] else want to be baptized? Here we have
[1:23:36] at least one Daniel.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Christ alone
[1:23:44] my hope is found.
[1:23:46] [Music]
[1:23:48] He is my light, my strength,
[1:23:52] my song.
[1:23:56] This corner stone,
[1:24:00] this solid ground
[1:24:03] [Music]
[1:24:05] firmed through the fiercest drought
[1:24:09] and storm.
[1:24:12] What heights of love,
[1:24:16] what depths of peace.
[1:24:20] When fears are still,
[1:24:25] when striving sees,
[1:24:29] my comfort,
[1:24:33] my all in all.
[1:24:38] Spirit, the love of Christ
[1:24:42] I stand.
[1:24:45] in Christ alone
[1:24:49] who took on flesh
[1:24:54] fullness of God in helless
[1:24:57] [Music]
[1:25:00] this gift of love
[1:25:05] and righteousness
[1:25:09] scorned by the ones he came
[1:25:13] to save
[1:25:16] till on that cross
[1:25:20] as Jesus died.
[1:25:24] The wrath of God
[1:25:28] was sisfied
[1:25:32] for every sin
[1:25:36] on him was paid.
[1:25:41] Here in the death of Christ
[1:25:45] I live.
[1:25:46] [Music]
[1:25:49] Amen. Tonight I'll continue on with this
[1:25:52] subject. I started to rush through and
[1:25:55] something said, "Hey, you're going too
[1:25:57] fast. Slow down, back up, and then just
[1:26:00] take it take it up again tonight." So,
[1:26:02] I'll I'll continue on with the subject
[1:26:05] tonight on divorce.
[1:26:08] And uh brother, young brother, if you
[1:26:10] want to go back and and brother Joe, if
[1:26:11] you want to go with him or sister,
[1:26:14] you're welcome to go too. Whoever wants
[1:26:16] to go back, go back and we'll baptize.
[1:26:20] Friends, this baptism,
[1:26:24] it is something that is all all
[1:26:28] important
[1:26:30] when you take on this name. I talked
[1:26:32] about marriage and I talked about
[1:26:33] divorce.
[1:26:35] When you go to baptism, it is like a
[1:26:39] marriage
[1:26:41] that you are going into that water and
[1:26:43] you are saying I commit my life to this
[1:26:48] bridegroom,
[1:26:50] to this man, Jesus Christ. I am
[1:26:52] committing my life to him.
[1:26:56] And if I go against him in the future, I
[1:26:59] don't want to be found committing
[1:27:01] adultery.
[1:27:03] I want to give my life to the Lord
[1:27:05] Jesus. I want to I want to dedicate my
[1:27:08] life to him. He is my bridegroom
[1:27:12] and I am his bride.
[1:27:14] And that's taking on that name even.
[1:27:17] That's why the the woman generally takes
[1:27:21] on the name of the man. We are taking on
[1:27:24] the name of Jesus Christ being
[1:27:27] Christians. And that's how
[1:27:31] important baptism is. It is. It's like a
[1:27:33] marriage except it's even more important
[1:27:36] than that. God bless you friends.
[1:27:41] There in the ground
[1:27:45] his body laid
[1:27:50] the light of the world by darkness
[1:27:54] slain.
[1:27:57] Then bursting forth
[1:28:01] in glorious day
[1:28:04] [Music]
[1:28:06] up from the grave he rose
[1:28:09] again.
[1:28:12] And as he stands
[1:28:16] in victory,
[1:28:20] since curse has lost
[1:28:24] its grip on me,
[1:28:28] for I am his
[1:28:32] and he is mine.
[1:28:37] by with the precious blood
[1:28:40] of Christ.
[1:28:43] And as he stands
[1:28:47] in victory,
[1:28:51] sin's curse has lost
[1:28:55] its grip on me.
[1:28:59] For I am his
[1:29:03] and he is mine.
[1:29:07] B with the precious blood
[1:29:11] of Christ.
[1:29:14] No guilt in life.
[1:29:18] No fear in death.
[1:29:22] This is the power of Christ
[1:29:26] in me.
[1:29:29] From last cry
[1:29:33] to final breath,
[1:29:38] Jesus commands my destiny.
[1:29:44] No power of hell,
[1:29:48] no scheme of man
[1:29:53] can ever block
[1:29:56] me from his hands
[1:30:00] till he returns
[1:30:05] or calls me home.
[1:30:09] Here in the power of Christ
[1:30:13] I stand. No guilt in life, no guilt in
[1:30:18] life,
[1:30:21] no fear in death.
[1:30:25] This is the power of Christ
[1:30:29] in me.
[1:30:32] From life's first cry
[1:30:36] to final breath,
[1:30:41] Jesus commands my destiny.
[1:30:47] No power of hell.
[1:30:52] No sche
[1:30:55] [Music]
[1:30:56] never close
[1:31:00] me from his hands
[1:31:04] till he returns.
[1:31:08] Oh, call me home
[1:31:13] here in the power of Christ.
[1:31:20] [Music]
[1:31:27] When peace
[1:31:30] like a river
[1:31:34] [Music]
[1:31:36] attendeth
[1:31:39] my way.
[1:31:43] When sorrows
[1:31:47] like seas
[1:31:50] pillows
[1:31:52] roll
[1:31:55] [Music]
[1:31:59] whatever
[1:32:03] my love
[1:32:05] thou has taught
[1:32:09] me
[1:32:11] to Say,
[1:32:13] "It is well."
[1:32:17] It is well
[1:32:21] with
[1:32:23] my soul.
[1:32:28] [Music]
[1:32:29] It is well
[1:32:32] [Music]
[1:32:37] with my soul.
[1:32:41] [Music]
[1:32:45] It is well.
[1:32:49] It is well
[1:32:52] with
[1:32:54] my soul.
[1:33:02] Though Satan
[1:33:03] [Music]
[1:33:05] should buff,
[1:33:09] though trials
[1:33:13] should come,
[1:33:17] let this
[1:33:19] blessings
[1:33:21] [Music]
[1:33:24] control
[1:33:31] that Christ
[1:33:33] has
[1:33:35] regarded
[1:33:38] my helpless
[1:33:40] [Music]
[1:33:42] estate
[1:33:44] and has shed
[1:33:48] his own blood
[1:33:51] for
[1:33:53] my soul.
[1:33:58] Bless you. Many here know brother Joe
[1:34:03] Hoginson, his wife and old friends to
[1:34:07] the church here. And now this young man,
[1:34:12] Matthew,
[1:34:14] he told me when I asked him on
[1:34:16] Wednesday, I said, "Why do you want to
[1:34:17] be baptized?" He said, "I want to give
[1:34:18] my heart to the Lord Jesus."
[1:34:26] He's 11 years old. Brother Joe was just
[1:34:28] talking with him over here outside the
[1:34:30] baptismal. He said that they read Acts
[1:34:33] 2:38 again this morning and they went
[1:34:36] over it and they prayed together and the
[1:34:39] young man is steadfast
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; in his decision. Do you have anything
[1:34:43] that you want to say, Matthew?
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; It is. This is like a marriage.
[1:34:50] This is something that you get baptized
[1:34:53] and you say, "Lord, I am committing
[1:34:55] myself to you." You can renew your vows,
[1:34:59] but this point right here is the time
[1:35:02] that you say, "I am a Christian. I am
[1:35:06] devoted to the Lord Jesus, and I take on
[1:35:09] his name in baptism." Amen.
[1:35:28] Matthew, by your own confession, I
[1:35:31] baptize you in the name of Lord Jesus
[1:35:34] Christ.
[1:35:36] [Applause]
[1:35:48] Praise God. We've baptized almost 90
[1:35:50] people
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; in the Tucson Tabernacle
[1:35:54] just just over the past couple years and
[1:35:58] want to keep them coming. Young Matthew,
[1:36:01] he said he's 11 years old and giving his
[1:36:03] heart to the Lord at that age. And then
[1:36:05] most of the people we've baptized have
[1:36:06] been adults by the grace of God. people
[1:36:09] coming and saying I want to serve God. I
[1:36:11] want to take on that name of Jesus
[1:36:13] Christ. That's why we baptize in the
[1:36:14] name of Jesus Christ.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; It's because we are taking on his name
[1:36:19] in baptism. God bless you, brother Dan.
[1:36:22] Daniel, I'll come down and close.
[1:36:31] How I
[1:36:34] breathe the air of heaven.
[1:36:39] Where pain is gone
[1:36:42] and mercy fills the streets.
[1:36:48] To look upon
[1:36:50] the one who bled to save me,
[1:36:56] to walk with him
[1:36:59] through all eternity.
[1:37:04] For there will be a day
[1:37:08] when all will bow before him.
[1:37:13] There will be a day
[1:37:16] when death will be no more.
[1:37:21] Standing face to face
[1:37:26] with you who died and rose
[1:37:30] again.
[1:37:32] Holy,
[1:37:34] holy is the Lord
[1:37:40] and every prayer
[1:37:42] we pray to desperation.
[1:37:46] [Music]
[1:37:48] The songs of faith
[1:37:51] we sing through doubt and fear.
[1:37:55] [Music]
[1:37:56] And in the end,
[1:37:59] we'll see that it was worth it when he
[1:38:05] returns
[1:38:07] to wipe away tears.
[1:38:12] Oh, there will be a day when all will
[1:38:17] bow before him.
[1:38:20] There will be a day
[1:38:23] when death will be no more
[1:38:28] standing face to face
[1:38:32] with he who died and rose again.
[1:38:38] Holy,
[1:38:40] holy is the Lord.
[1:38:45] And on that day,
[1:38:48] we join the resurrection
[1:38:53] and stand beside
[1:38:56] the heroes of the faith.
[1:39:01] And with one voice
[1:39:04] a thousand generations
[1:39:10] worthy is the lamb who was slain.
[1:39:17] And on that day
[1:39:20] we join the resurrection
[1:39:25] and stand beside
[1:39:28] the heroes of the faith.
[1:39:33] And with one voice
[1:39:36] a thousand generations
[1:39:42] worthy is the lamb who was slain
[1:39:49] forever.
[1:39:51] He
[1:39:53] will reign.
[1:39:55] So let it be today.
[1:39:58] We shout the hymn of heaven.
[1:40:03] With angels and the saints
[1:40:06] we raise a mighty
[1:40:09] roar and glory to our God
[1:40:14] who gave us life beyond the grave.
[1:40:20] Worthy,
[1:40:22] worthy is the lamb.
[1:40:32] [Music]
[1:40:37] You are worthy of it all.
[1:40:40] [Music]
[1:40:45] You are worthy of it all.
[1:40:48] [Music]
[1:40:53] For from you are all things
[1:40:57] and to you are all things.
[1:41:02] You deserve the glory.
[1:41:06] All the saints
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; and all the saints and angels
[1:41:19] they bow before
[1:41:22] your throne.
[1:41:27] And all the elders
[1:41:31] cast
[1:41:33] their crowns before the lamb
[1:41:37] of God
[1:41:39] and sing
[1:41:41] you are worthy of it all.
[1:41:49] You are worthy of it all.
[1:41:55] [Music]
[1:41:56] For from you are all things,
[1:42:00] and to you are all things.
[1:42:04] You deserve the glory.
[1:42:09] [Music]
[1:42:12] Amen. Friends, had an experience. I was
[1:42:16] in the pull pit that I haven't had yet
[1:42:19] as a pastor.
[1:42:22] And as I was ministering, I had had my
[1:42:26] notes and I had my scriptures lined out.
[1:42:30] And I could see
[1:42:33] the look on the congregation's faces as
[1:42:37] I started talking about this subject of
[1:42:39] divorce because it's affected so many
[1:42:41] people.
[1:42:43] And there were I could feel
[1:42:47] there were thoughts
[1:42:50] of
[1:42:52] um
[1:42:54] genuine thoughts of of have I made have
[1:42:58] I made a a horrible mistake and am I
[1:43:00] going to continue to suffer with it?
[1:43:02] There were thoughts of what's he going
[1:43:05] to say? Is he going to say it in the way
[1:43:09] that that I believe it in the way that's
[1:43:10] right? There was there was the
[1:43:13] criticals, there was the afraid
[1:43:17] and everyone it was amazing to me that
[1:43:20] everyone had an opinion and everyone
[1:43:24] this subject of divorce,
[1:43:27] it affects so many people and it has
[1:43:30] hurt so many people and and you can you
[1:43:36] can see why all the way from the
[1:43:39] beginning
[1:43:41] I believe I I truly believe in this
[1:43:44] doctrine called the serpent seat
[1:43:47] where
[1:43:49] that really the
[1:43:53] original sin was unbelief and not
[1:43:55] believing God's word but it was adultery
[1:43:58] in the Garden of Eden.
[1:44:01] And the enemy keeps going to that well
[1:44:06] over and over again.
[1:44:09] And he keeps trying to throw a division
[1:44:13] between a husband and a wife, as he did
[1:44:15] with Adam and Eve, as he did many, many
[1:44:19] all the way down through where Moses had
[1:44:22] to write this writing of divorcement.
[1:44:25] Not because it was the right thing to
[1:44:26] do, but it was because the hardness of
[1:44:27] the people's hearts.
[1:44:30] Paul when he was judging these things he
[1:44:32] said this say I not the Lord
[1:44:36] if we would do it the way that the Lord
[1:44:38] commanded it we wouldn't suffer these
[1:44:41] things
[1:44:43] but we fail as humans
[1:44:48] and I read that scripture that God makes
[1:44:50] a way out for us I'm not by any means
[1:44:53] condoning
[1:44:55] um divorce and remarage and any of that
[1:44:58] I'm not I'm not saying that at all. But
[1:45:00] I am grateful for the grace of God
[1:45:03] that he loves us. And I really
[1:45:07] appreciate what
[1:45:09] brother Brandham said in that quote from
[1:45:11] marriage and divorce.
[1:45:13] He said, "Teach your children not to do
[1:45:16] this."
[1:45:18] And I think that the pastors need to,
[1:45:20] and when I was up there, something's
[1:45:24] like, "Stop.
[1:45:26] Slow down."
[1:45:28] And
[1:45:30] I can see the nervousness of a minister.
[1:45:33] It may be
[1:45:35] in a church of 10,000 people or it may
[1:45:38] be in a church of of a hundred people.
[1:45:41] But I can see the the nervousness of a
[1:45:44] pastor to address that because every
[1:45:47] situation is different
[1:45:50] and we can't just throw out a blanket
[1:45:53] rule because it doesn't work. And as
[1:45:56] with the Old Testament,
[1:45:58] people will
[1:46:01] find ways around the rules.
[1:46:03] But the way that that you can't get
[1:46:05] around is if you have the Holy Spirit in
[1:46:07] your life and if you have the Holy
[1:46:09] Spirit in your union. And that is the
[1:46:12] most important thing. You have to have
[1:46:15] the spirit of God in the family.
[1:46:19] And if you put him first, then these
[1:46:21] irreconcilable differences that I said,
[1:46:23] and we all have them, and and you don't
[1:46:26] have to agree on everything, but you
[1:46:28] have to be civil and you have to love
[1:46:29] each other, and you have to be able to
[1:46:32] move forward. And when we have that Holy
[1:46:35] Spirit in our lives, we can respect that
[1:46:37] other person. We can pray for that other
[1:46:39] person. we can get on our knees and
[1:46:44] pray, "Lord, help me to understand what
[1:46:47] she's going through. I love her so
[1:46:50] much."
[1:46:52] And I'm sure that my wife has been on
[1:46:53] her knees for me and I've been on my
[1:46:55] knees for her saying, "Lord, help me to
[1:46:59] understand
[1:47:01] her perspective. Help me to understand
[1:47:03] what she's going through so I could have
[1:47:06] more compassion.
[1:47:08] and let me get myself out of the way and
[1:47:10] let me as a Christian prefer the other
[1:47:13] person.
[1:47:15] Let me prefer my wife. Let me prefer my
[1:47:18] husband over my own desires.
[1:47:21] And that's a Christian. It's not just in
[1:47:22] a husband and a wife situation. It's in
[1:47:26] the whole our whole lives. And you'll
[1:47:28] see in the sermon on the mount as we go
[1:47:29] go forward in that Jesus, he changed the
[1:47:34] world.
[1:47:36] He preached a message that made all of
[1:47:40] God's commandments and and everything
[1:47:44] that God had said, he made it real and
[1:47:47] it it took it off of the pages of the
[1:47:50] Bible and placed it all the way inside
[1:47:53] of our hearts where it it governs
[1:47:55] everything that we say or do.
[1:47:58] That's the Holy Spirit.
[1:48:01] And Jesus had to die
[1:48:06] for our sins. And he had to be
[1:48:09] resurrected again before he could send
[1:48:11] that Holy Spirit. And he did send it.
[1:48:15] And we should let that govern everything
[1:48:17] that we do. We should let that govern in
[1:48:19] our our relationships with our husbands,
[1:48:22] relationships with wives and families
[1:48:25] and church, friends, work. Let that
[1:48:28] govern everything. Friends, you with me?
[1:48:32] Let's all Let's all stand.
[1:48:38] Our
[1:48:43] Lord,
[1:48:47] Lord, we pray for the marriages that are
[1:48:50] in our church, in our congregation,
[1:48:54] Lord, that you would strengthen
[1:48:56] our bonds that we have together.
[1:49:00] Lord, we pray
[1:49:02] for those that are are without
[1:49:05] a spouse.
[1:49:08] Father, that they have a hard time. We
[1:49:10] pray Lord that that you would strengthen
[1:49:13] that person, those people. Help them to
[1:49:16] get through, Father. And the scars,
[1:49:19] Lord, that are behind many
[1:49:23] from difficult relationships, Lord. We
[1:49:25] pray that you would heal those scars
[1:49:28] and Father, renew them. We pray.
[1:49:32] May the joy of the Holy Spirit just fill
[1:49:34] each one. Lord,
[1:49:37] we pray,
[1:49:39] Father, for our families,
[1:49:41] for the youth,
[1:49:43] for those that have not entered in to
[1:49:47] these bonds of marriage to to these,
[1:49:50] Father, this holy matrimony. We pray
[1:49:52] that Lord that each one would find the
[1:49:53] right one,
[1:49:55] one that would compleimement them as far
[1:49:58] as bring Lord strengths where they have
[1:50:01] weaknesses.
[1:50:04] And Lord, bring joy. We pray. We love
[1:50:07] you. We thank you for your goodness to
[1:50:10] us.
[1:50:12] Lord, we ask that you would help us in
[1:50:15] everything that we do. And Lord, if
[1:50:17] there would be sin in our lives, and we
[1:50:19] know that there there are sins,
[1:50:23] Father, those dominating forces, the
[1:50:26] right hand or the right eye,
[1:50:29] Lord, make a way of escape for us that
[1:50:32] we can overcome,
[1:50:34] these bad influences in our lives.
[1:50:38] And Lord, replace
[1:50:41] whatever void it may be when we cut it
[1:50:43] out, replace it with the Holy Spirit.
[1:50:45] Father, we pray strengthen us, Lord. We
[1:50:49] love you and we thank you in Jesus
[1:50:51] Christ's name. Amen.
[1:50:55] Tonight, so tonight, I'll um carry on
[1:50:58] where we left off and also give a a
[1:51:00] little report on um some things that
[1:51:04] we're doing at church. And we uh we have
