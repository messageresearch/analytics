bless you welcome and the family it's good to have good to have all of our visitors in in service today it's uh that scripture that we have an advocate with the Lord we should never forget that what what a what a blessing it is to know that and that word that Advocate it means that Jesus is doing something he's doing something for us and he also expects us to do something in for each other and with these kids I was watching these kids sing and and seeing them go out and I was thinking Lord I'm for these kids I want to be an advocate for these kids I want to do everything that I can to help these kids because they are the Next Generation if the Lord would T and if we think so often we hear about Revival we we we we like that word it seems like everybody likes to think of a Revival happening a Revival is something that's Reviving something that's already inside of you and stirring it up and and getting it moving and getting it out and if we want a Revival let me ask for those of you that know what a Revival is who would like to have a Revival I raise my hand too to have a Revival we've got to do Revival things we don't just sit we don't just do nothing we have to do things that can produce a Revival we had a men's meeting yesterday it's such a blessing with with the brothers and just seeing that feeling the energy in in the the brothers and and how they want to do things and that's what we need to Foster in our church not just as I said not just coming to church when you come to church be part of church don't just come to to hear a sermon or don't just come to sing you be part of this ministry and don't don't just let it let it sit be an advocate be and help other people there was this man way back in the turn of the century 19 around 1900 his name was Charles param he was a famous Pentecostal type they didn't have a Pentecostal denomination back then but he was uh he was advocate for speaking in tongues and and and he was just a well-respected minister in the United States at that time the late 1800s early 1900s and he met a man that um he saw hope in he saw potential in this young man this is in the jimm Crow laws this is uh this this man this young man was a black was a black man with he he had lost his eye to small poox and he this man par of me saw that there was some there was potential in this man his name is William Seymour and there back then it was the the segregation laws the Jim Crow laws so the blacks weren't allowed to to mix with the whites they weren't allowed to have integrated Services they weren't even allowed to be in the same schools together so Charles param he started this school down in Texas and he invited this young man that he wanted to invest in he invited him to come into school now it would have caused big problems if the young man would have been in the classroom but he say you know what we'll get past that you can sit right here in the doorway and you can listen to these to these um lessons and the young man William Seymour started continued to grow in the Lord and the other people saw that this man had a lot of potential so So eventually he was offered a pastorship position in Los Angeles now I believe he was in Houston and this church the uh the pastor was a woman and and she wanted to go out on the missionary field I believe it was Liberia Africa and she invited this this uh William Seymour to come and be pastor of this church that she was pastoring so Seymour comes out gets to Los Angeles and he preaches sermon and they were like you know what we don't want him we don't want this this isn't like what we're used to this isn't like our way of thinking this isn't like what what we grew up with so no you know what you can't be our pastor you preached this one sermon you can't be our pastor so you know what they did they padlocked the doors so Seymour couldn't come in anymore so he was devastated he he didn't have a way back home he was poor as a church mouse he didn't he he couldn't pay his way back back so some other people he meets some other people and they say well let's have a Bible study let's have a prayer service in our home so he goes there and they start praying together after a little while the group gets too big for the house they move to another house the group continues to grow and get bigger pretty soon there's people standing outside the windows they open the windows there's people out outside there and they're listening to the sermon and they're worshiping and it grew up so big that there were so many people out in the back porch one day that it collapsed from all the weight on it so then they said well we got to get a bigger place so they moved to downtown Los Angeles on a street called isua Street and they got this big warehouse and they started the isua Street Revival because I believe that this man Charles param even though they separated ways and they didn't agree later on he saw hope and he saw potential in that young man William Seymour seeing these kids what potential they have and and I can't help it brothers and sisters I see potential in every single person in this building without exception every single one and I believe that's how the Lord Jesus really sees in us there was a Catholic man believe his name was Ingram in Jeffersonville Indiana way back just a little while after this happened there was a a fire that this church in Jeffersonville burnt down and there's this group of people the pastor of the church says he gets out of Dodge because his his building had burned down he had no way to pay for it so he ups and leaves and he leaves this young man here that was an associate pastor and with this 20 people or so with no Pastor no building no nothing well this Catholic man that had a that that was an influential in the city and he had a lot of money he sees potential in this young Minister named William Brandon and he says I'll tell you what I'll help you build a church and he provides the money provides the land on a on a alone and I don't know if he eventually just gave the church but but that was in 1933 and they started building the brandom Tabernacle and it it started it didn't really when I say it started to grow it grew a little bit when they got it finished in third sometime in 1934 they started having Services there rather than in a tent just down the street and other people started to believe in this man and then 1947 that happened in 1933 years later 14 years later in 1947 that is when his ministry started to take off that's when his the Revival that came after brother brandham started this charismatic Revival and it swept all over the world and just people after thousands of people were healed and thousands of people gave their hearts to the Lord really because just a few people believed in this man at the very beginning very few but somebody did and then later on we see this we call it the Jesus movement and this hippie shows up drug addicted homos seual hippie shows up to this man's house and this man didn't want to accept him at the beginning but his his I believe it was his daughter had met him and this young man his name was Lonnie frisbee had a calling in his life and this P this man that had this Lonnie frisbee show up to his house was the pastor of a church with about 25 people in it and he welcomed this hippie boy into this congregation because he saw a a realness in this young man and this young man started preaching the pastor's name was Chuck Smith this young man started preaching and led thousands upon thousands of hippies and other people to the Lord Jesus and they changed their way of life brother R believe are you from that that Movement we have one and there's many that we know that came from that movement because somebody believed in these people someone were were these people were willing to make a sacrifice and make an effort that this young one of these young men or a young lady or whatever it might be could actually do something great at one after the other and we see that none of them would have been able to do it if somebody didn't believe him Jesus in each of these cases the people who invested in these Souls they didn't try to make these people emulate themselves they didn't try this Ingram that helped brother brandom he didn't try to make brother brandom a Catholic he helped him William Seymour those that supported him they didn't try to make William Seymour a Methodist or whatever it is they they they just supported as the Lord led him with with this Jesus movement in the 60 late 60s and 70s they didn't try this this um Chuck Smith didn't try to make these people like him that came from the Four Square movement he didn't try to make them like him he supported the calling that he had in his life may sound strange to hear that but it's true and God used these people and as I said if you want a Revival in your life if you want a Revival in church you have to look back and you have to do Revival things that let's not sit around and be happy with the way you are you need to do Revival things you need to to make it where the Lord can use you whether you're supporting someone else or whether you're doing it there has to be change to have a Revival Jesus he was walking through the city and he saw potential in this little short guy named zakus he sees him and of course the Lord Jesus was God in flesh and he could see the inner thoughts but he sees this man zakus and this man was hated he was the chief of the the tax collectors in the area of Jericho this man was a crook he was a sinner he was an what we would call an awful person yet Jesus is walking by and Zak he has heard about this man Jesus and he's like I want to see him but he's too short and the the crowd's too big he climbs up in this sycamore tree and he's watching as Jesus is coming and Jesus looks up and he sees zakus and he saw potential in that little man as much of a sinner as he was and he looks up and he says zakus come down he says I want to go to your house and that day zakus changed zakus brought him in and made food and he and and he repented we've been going over repentance not only did he he feel bad for what he had done he also made a change in his life and he said Lord I'll repay I'll repay everything anything that I've done wrong to anyone I am ready to pay it back we see the change in zakus and you know what Jesus says to him he he looks at zakus and he says this day salvation has come to your house and that same salvation that same man the Bible tells us that he is the same yesterday and today and forever and he is the same one that can come into our homes he's the same same person Jesus started a Revival and to start a Revival you got to do Revival things and there's things that sometimes they are not comfortable the um the Bible says Jesus was talking about the end times and he said that you Compass the sea he was looking at the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the scribes and he says you'll go all the way across the ocean to make one proelite a proelite is someone that you convert from one Church to another church and he says you'll cross the sea just to get one and you'll be so proud of that one and you'll get that one person you'll convince that one person to think like you and he says you make him twofold more of a child of Hell than you are yourselves oh that's what Jesus that's what Jesus said it's not trying to make someone mimic you or emulate you it's trying to get that person support that person to get to Jesus Christ that was a Revival type statement that Jesus said and look what he did he invested Jesus called Jesus invested in the callings of his disciples he invested in the calling of Peter and James and John and a and Matthew and Nathaniel and Phillip Jesus invested in them and they are the ones that took the message of Jesus Christ and spread it around the world they are the ones who took the Revival to the world because Jesus Christ believed in them he was an advocate of them and we always think well I don't have I don't have this gift I don't have that gift when we say that we're looking at ourselves and it is taught it is in human nature to always look at ourselves and I say it many times and I know you probably get tired of me saying it it ain't about you it's not it's about the cause it's about Christ and when you're always thinking well I'm not good at this or or I fail here or I failed there you're thinking about yourself and you're not thinking about the other person that you can invest in Jesus invested in his disciples and they took the message to the world that is what Christianity that's what it's about Jesus said himself he said prefer another man's wealth over your own I always thought when I read that as a kid I always thought wow you're supposed to want that guy's money no you're not you're supposed to want that you wantan to you want that person to succeed more than you want yourself to succeed how many people think like that but Jesus said you prefer another man's wealth over your own and it's almost never Revival it's almost never going out into the streets and witnessing and and and passing out tracks that's good and some people come in like that but it starts at home it starts at your with your family it starts with your children it starts with your friends your cousins your colleagues at work you invest your time into them you invest your love into those people and then you you start something in them and then it flourishes do you know someone who you could invest your time to do you know someone that needs it you do every single one of you everybody's looking at me every single one of you does now let's pause for a second think about who that person is that could really use you that could really use some help that could really use some of your time that could really use some of your prayers think about them that's how a Revival starts there's a parable in the Bible that Jesus talks about investing and he talks about how that that the kingdom he F first of all he's he tells the he tells the story in Luke and it was it was right after zakus and Jesus says that salvation has come to your home and and then he's walking and he's walking into the Jerusalem and the people are saying wow the Kingdom of Heaven is now it's going to happen and they get all excited and Jesus says wait a minute he says hold on there's something else that has to happen before and then he tells the story in Luke and he tells it in Matthew let's go to Matthew chapter 25 and read the story that Jesus tells this Parable we're on this series these series of Parables and this is a parable that we should apply to our lives Matthew chap 25:13 Jesus says this watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh for the Kingdom of Heaven he's like be ready because this the second coming of Christ is at hand watch therefore for you know not the day nor the hour when the son of man cometh for the Kingdom of Heaven is as a man traveling into a far country who called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods and unto one he gave five talents these are bags of gold okay unto one he gave five talents unto another to another two and to another one and to every man ACC according to his several ability and straightway took his journey so he gives these bag of gold to the servants and they each had different levels of ability and notice the master didn't tell the servants what to do with the gold he didn't give them instructions he just gives them the gold with the assumption that they're not going to know what to do and he gave the one with the highest ability the most and he gave the one that maybe had lesser ability the least then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same and made them other five talents so he took the five talents he invested it and he made and he doubled his money and likewise he that received two talents he gained also other two so this man with two talents he also received he he invested and got two talents now he was gone for a long time and after a long time the lord of the those servants cometh and and reckon with them I'm sorry I skipped verse one of the most important verses 18 now enemy trying to make me miss the most important part I'll start with 17 and likewise he that received two he also gained two but he that had received one went and digged in the earth and hid the Lord's money after a long time the lord of the those servants cometh and reckon with with them now they had not heard back from this ruler for probably many many years they had taken what he had given them they knew that this was a gift that they were given they knew that they had to multiply this they knew that he was going to come back and Jesus is telling the story when they thought hey the the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand he's like wait a minute listen to this and he invested and he each one of these invested in something that that that propagated the Lord's money and you notice when we're going to bring this back to witnessing to someone notice you don't just tell them about Jesus you if you see potential in a person you invest in that person you're not just going out and witnessing you have a friend that needs help you stay with that person your your children you continue to encourage them to serve the Lord you're always in you're always doing something so then that investment will come to fruition and so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents saying Lord thou Deliver Us unto me five talents behold I have gained beside them five talents more his lord said unto to him well done thou good and faithful servant thou H has been Faithful over a few things I will make thee R ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of the Lord so he's saying hey I invested in you in my investment I had a return on my investment just like Charles parm did for William Seymour you made he made he made a lot of investment in him and then he received far more of a return earn on this man he also that had received two talents came and said Lord thou deliver unto me two talents behold I have gained two other talents beside them the Lord said unto him well done good and faithful servant thou has been Faithful over a few things I will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of the Lord then he which had received one Talent came and said Lord I knew thee that thou art a hard man reaping where thou Hast not sown and Gathering where thou Hast not straw Chuck Smith the pastor of Calvary Chapel had invited this man in he had only like 25 people they were tithe paying members and then when he started bringing these other people in those tith paying members those important people they started leaving and he made this commitment to these people he said no I'm going to stand firm I believe in this I believe that these are souls I I want I have a burden for them we are going to stay the course and he continued on he invested in them and many of of those people there was only as I said there's only about 25 they they left and remember think about how it's shrinking and think about these hippies they don't have any money they don't have anything to contribute but with this man it wasn't about that and this man continues on and he's there and he's with the master and he he has this bag of gold and he says here you go he says I knew I was I knew that that you're a hard man I knew that there was punishment there if I lost anything so I buried it and here's your gold fruits of the spirit we think about the fruits of the spirit he might have had the fruits of the spirit he had the gold but he didn't do anything with them it was all about himself he just didn't want to get in trouble and I was afraid and I went and I hid thy talent in the earth and lo there Hast that is thine and the Lord answered him thou Wicked and slothful servant thou keepest thou knewest that I reap where I sowed and thou ought therefore to have put where I swed and gather where I have I have not straw thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers and then coming I should have received my own with Usery so he say you may not be a preacher you may not be a businessman you may not be a theologian but you could have at least grown my investment you could at least earn some interest on it but you were too afraid to do anything where are the fruits of my investment in you take therefore the the talent from him and give it to the one that had 10 talents for unto everyone that shall everyone that hath shall be given and he that shall have and he shall have abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath and cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness and there shall be weeping and nashing of teeth punishment were severe and we think of what happened why did Jesus tell the story he was afraid brother Michael sings that song um I'm no longer a slave to fear fear can destroy us fear makes it if you're afraid of how your church is going to think you're you're afraid of of failure you're afraid of that somebody's going to reject you and yet this young this man that had the one Talent he was afraid and look at the ultimate destination that he had it's a it's a a frightening thing so we look and I'm I'm sorry I'm just gonna the notes the the computer thing messed me up people are important brothers and sisters and we are here for a purpose this church is here for a purpose this potluck is there for a purpose the the men's meeting we had yesterday is here for a purpose we are to serve one another the fruits of the spirit all of them are for other people they're not for us we look and we say well love joy peace well do I have these things I don't know if I have these things they're not for you there are to be given out a fruit what is a fruit for a fruit grows on a tree it's to feed something else it's not to feed ourselves this I'm going to tell this story of this fig tree here in a minute the Fig Tree this a fig tree grows up and it Bears it's supposed to bear fruit if it doesn't bear fruit then that fig tree is no good and so often I think that all of us we're all leaves and no figs might cover the trunk but is it helping someone else Luke Chapter 13 this parable of the fig tree verse six he spake also this Parable a certain man had a fig tree planted in his Vineyard and he came and sought fruit thereon and found none this by the way this has been such a blessing to me it's just a few sentences but as I have studied this and thought about this over the past few days I've thought about the advocate of Jesus Christ and I've thought about all all that we do here in the church and I I just I was taken back and he spake this Parable read it again a certain man had a fig tree planted in his Vineyard and he came and sought fruit fruit thereon and he found none then he said unto the dresser of his Vineyard behold these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree and found none I cut it down and he says cut it down why cth the ground he says I've looked at this tree it gets leaves the leaves fall off there's no fruit the thing is just worthless and it's taking up a space I could cut it off and I could put another tree that'll bear fruit there then he said then he said under the dresser three years this is happened and the and the dresser the man that was working answered and said unto him Lord let it alone this year also till I shall dig about it and dung it and if it bear fruit well and if not then after that you can cut it down look at this advocate of this man that's working in this in this Orchard he this this this the owner he comes it's like God the father he comes down he says you're sinning I'm I'm sick and tired of you this is It's grieve the Lord and here here he is ready to to take out this tree because it's not bearing fruit and here is the person working in the orch say wait wait wait Lord wait wait wait wait let me give it a little time let me give it a little love let me dig around the tree put some fertilizer there so I can get some water and then and then if it's after a year then you can cut it down lord just wait just don't do it I remember my my grandfather had he had an orchard of pecan trees and the trees started they wouldn't bear fruit they they would bear a little bit so my grandpa was getting old and he told me he says Hey can can you if I pay you can you come dig the wells I was like yeah I'm not pay you I'll go dig the wells so I went out and I dug these big wells around the pecan trees put some mulch in there and took it took care so they could get water in there and they started thriving and they started they started bearing fruit and they started doing well think about that what Jesus isn't talking so we be gardeners he's talking about us and we have an advocate in Jesus Christ and and here we are we're Sinners and we've live lived our life under this place and we've failed and we've done wrong and we've messed up and all of these things and and here is our time comes and here is our Africa Jesus Christ and says wait wait wait wait give me a little time give me a little time with them and that's what we should do if we have the spirit of Christ should we not do it for each other we see people failing we see people not bearing fruit we see problems in the church we see problems in our friends wait wait wait Lord have mercy I'll do something I'll help this person I'll reach out to this person and then if they're not called if they're not one of your elect then Lord then you can cut them down but just give me a little bit more time how many of us have that that calling and that burden for other people I know some of you do and I've seen it but we should all have that burden just like the man with the talents the one with with with the five talents with the five bags of gold he knew what to do he put it to work he he wor he worked hard and he wanted to to propagate this he wanted the Master to have more when he came back the other one said I'm good I'm fine I'm going to bury my blessings and and I'm just going to leave them there all the fruits of the spirit all the word of God I'm just going to bury it and it's not going to do anybody else any good but me that's what these parables are saying they're saying Get Out work for each other why would Jesus tell us something like that do you think maybe because he cared do you think maybe because he loves his people do you think maybe because he's gone he's not gone but he's not here in the flesh but he sent his Spirit down to to spread the gospel he said Tell The World about me he said preach the gospel he he came and did it for three and a half years now he said now you go do it he was one man when he was in the flesh but it went around the world in a Revival when that same spirit that Christ had went into the people and they started digging around the trees look at Jesus with Mary Magdalene I mean as bad as you can be Jesus father give me some time with her and he goes out he digs around the well so she can get water so she can get nutrients and then that barren fig tree started bearing fruit look at look at Peter we went through Peter I believe it was last week Peter's there and I mean a cussing fisherman and he's out there and and he fishes all night no fish and and he's upset and his and his brother Andrew and then their Partners Jame James and John they had their boat Peter and Andrew had their boat they fish all night then they're not catching anything and they're they're tending their Nets and here comes Jesus Christ walking along the shore and he says hey he says let's go out into the water Jesus saw something in Peter he saw that this tree can bear fruit even though we would have never seen it he saw there was something about this man so they go out and they go into the deep water Jesus Peter didn't know he was wasn't a disciple yet there was something though that there was a little bit there that that that Jesus had done some work around the around the base of that tree they get out in he says let's go out into the deeper water Peter's like there's no fish out in the deeper water let's go out in the deeper water he's like okay and he says cast your nets over Peter's like we fished all night there's no fish there Jesus said just do it Peter they lower their Nets they start pulling back the Nets there's Peter and John in the boat they're pulling them this is heavy pull uh Peter um not Peter and John Peter and Andrew and they're pulling and and Andrew's like Peter I can't get this up there's a lot of fish in here so there's the boat of John and a John and James over there they're like hey John James come over here and help us so they come over and they start pulling up this net and is just full of fish and they get it into the boat it fills the boat up and what does Peter do that that mulch that had gone around the tree Peter falls down and he says I'm not worthy he says just leave Jesus you shouldn't be in the same boat as me I'm not worthy to be anywhere near you Peter said or or Jesus said he saysf follow me and I will make you fishes of men see he saw that potential he saw what Peter could be he saw what James could be he saw what John could be then he goes and he's walking and he sees he comes by Matthew this tax collector remember zius he was a creep and he changed and Here Comes Here Comes Jesus and he's walking by this this tax collector I wonder if Matthew had already been a disciple by the time he got to zakus I believe but I wonder if Matthew had some compassion on zakus too maybe saw some potential there Peter or Jesus is walking by the the money changers and hears the crooks and they're cheating the people he looks down tells Matthew says come follow me Matthew drops it Jesus saw something in Matthew comes to Phillip he walks by philli he says Phillip come follow me now watch the fruit that Philip Bears Philip goes and he sees he he sees Jesus Jesus Jus says come follow me Philip drops everything he follows Jesus he goes to his friend Phillip saw that he had he he saw in his friend he he thought that there is potential in my friend Nathaniel so he goes and he finds Nathaniel and he looks and there's Nathaniel And he was under a fig tree and he was praying Philip stops wow there he is sees potential and he goes and he tells him and he says hey I met this man Jesus of Nazareth Nathaniel's like what do you mean Jesus of Naz Nazareth he say what good could come out of that place no no no no no no just come and see Phillip had confidence and then Nathaniel gets up there and all he needed to do is had have dug around the well a little bit have a little a little bit somebody that cares and Philip provided that Nathaniel's walking up he says and Jesus looks at him he says behold an Israelite and whom know your no gel's like how did you know me and he says when you were under the Fig Tree when Philip called you he said I saw you there Lord and you see fruit was born right there he recognized he recognized that and then the Apostle Paul later on how many people that we we could go through we could I could go through all o over and over and over so many people that they had potential and God saw that potential the Apostle Paul God saw saw potential in that man here he is he's coming and Not only was was he not bearing fruit I mean there was Cactus growing all around Paul he was sticky he was he he hated he had a bad attitude he was worse than all of them and here comes Jesus and he says you know what I'm gonna dig around a little bit I'm gonna cut these cactuses out and he sees Paul for what he was cold hard religious spirit not only did he not have fruit as I said but he he had he was full of hatred and God didn't cut the tree down God had patience with him then Jesus comes and changes that man completely around Paul led many many people to Christ Paul at the end of his ministry he's he he comes to trial and he appeals to Caesar now he's in Chains and he's going to go to Rome and this King named agria comes to him and he's like oh yeah I've always wanted to meet this guy Agrippa was was a weirdo married his sister yeah not not not a not a good guy at all and he's like oh yeah I want to see Paul so here's Paul a grippa comes in and Paul's in these chains and and King Agrippa and then the the the other guy named fesus they're talking to Paul and Paul's like listen agria look at the attitude that Paul had he cared about this man no matter how weird he was he cared about his soul and Paul looked at him and Paul saw potential he said AG grippa he gives him his testimony he says I was on my way and yeah I was a bad guy and I did all these things wrong and I was wanting to kill all these Christians and then God got a hold of me Agrippa and he says Agrippa do you don't you believe the prophets this man Jesus fulfilled what the prophet said and then he says this Paul says Agrippa he says I know you believe he laid it before him it wasn't successful with a a grippa but look how Paul saw even he even saw potential in that man and everyone that he talked to Philip when he when he was later on and in the book of Acts Philip is out and he's preaching a a Revival in this city the Lord leads him out into the into the field into the desert and he sees potential in this this man this that this Ethiopian important person he's in his Chariot and he's reading probably out loud reading Isaiah and here comes Philip he saw potential in this man this unic and he says what are you reading comes gets up on his chair Chariot and starts talking with him and leads that man to the Lord Jesus he saw potential as I said if you want to do Revival if you want to have a Revival you need to do Revival things don't judge one another always put someone put them in the highest the highest of your thoughts and say you know what I see potential all of us brother Manny how what if somebody wouldn't have show saw any potential in me Manny wrote this text me this morning sent me a picture of the food that he was making and there he said God's good he gave me the desires of my heart gave me a new family including the congregation you guys are my brothers and sisters in Christ you guys show me all kinds of mad love and respect I don't know what that means but it's good says I appreciate every one of you in this congregation God saw potential brother man where were you many years ago yeah he says I was Paul I was full of cactus there wasn't there wasn't anything in me brother lion where were you many years ago but God saw potential in you he saw potential in me I was the one that was more like Paul I was a legalistic one that there was no potential in at all in there and God saw something in me I see it in every one of us that if we would just dig around and we would just take care of one another if we would just help one another what could God do if you want a Revival do Revival things Reach Out spend some of your time invest in this because great things let me tell you great things are going to happen they are prophesied to happen they will happen one day I want to be a part of it I'm not going to just take my own fig leaves and not bear fruit all leaves and no fruit so often bear that fruit but to do it it takes an effort you have to help someone else you have to pray for someone else and when you do that you will see that the fruits are starting to Bear In You Jesus said he said don't go outwardly don't go outside and pray on the corner or come to the platform and pray this big long prayer and it sounds so good he said don't do that he says if you do that you've already got your reward was like oh yeah pray is really nice that's nice I love to hear him pray he said don't do that he said go into your closet get down on your knees and pray in secret and then he says if you pray in secret then the Lord will reward you openly what does that mean doesn't mean you'll be exalted it doesn't mean that if if I'm in my closet praying for you brother Joe that that that God's going to answer my prayer and then I'm going to say oh I prayed wasn't me God's going to answer my prayer for you God's going to answer the burden that I have on my heart for that person then in openly God is glorified because that person changed think about all these people that I've mentioned it's because someone believed in them Daniel you can come for closing in the worship team let me read this verse again my little children these things I write unto you that you sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and he is the perpetuation for our sins and not for ours only but also but for the sins of the whole world that's the heart of Christ he will never stop fighting for you you have someone that does not want to see you fail if you don't truly know Christ if you're not truly bearing fruit in your life remember Jesus never stops fighting he is that one that's out in that field and he's tending to that tree he's he's saying I'm I'm going to I'm going to get it okay and then the water's going to come in and then the fruit is going to bear and then that tree is going to be saved that's why Jesus was saying it he is that advocate he is the vine dresser he is the one that's taking care of the field and there's the father that pronounced judgment upon the upon the Earth and there's Jesus saying father give me some time I'll take care of it's going to bear fruit it's going to change he will never he will never stop fighting for you you may turn from him but he will always be there and he is the one that won't sometimes we give up on people but Jesus Christ will never give up on you he will never stop fighting for you he will always be that one that just just stays the wrath of God just a little bit further I know there Sinners I know they're not bearing fruit I know that they have all these problems but I'll fertilize them I'll Water them I'll prune them I'll take care of them and if we have Christ's Spirit then we will do the same for our children we'll do the same for our husbands we'll do the same for our wives we'll do the same for our cousins we'll do the same for our neighbors and that's where our Revival starts it's starts when we do that for each other and these disciples they they've done it I listed many examples and if it Wells up in you like God well they're not Believers these people that that the pastor was talking about I don't want to be like [Music] them that's why there's no Revival that's why there's no that's why there's no converts that's why there's no fruit the fruits of the spirit it's in Galatians let me find it thanks [Music] bro brother Manny God bless you you know you've been such your testimony has been such a blessing Galatians 5:22 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law all of these things all of these fruits of the spirit they are not for you if you are bearing them the fig tree doesn't bear fruit for itself it Bears it for other people that's where we miss it but Christians brothers and sisters start tending those wells around those those trees because you don't know if they'll bear fruit or not let God sort it out Paul went to Agrippa he didn't know if Agrippa was going to be converted or not Paul the prophet the Apostle the greatest of them all he didn't know and here he is before this King and this King was a sinner and everything and he says oh Agrippa he says I would like I just wish you would be like me agria said I I you almost convinced me Paul and he says oh if you just were like me you would have such Joy such peace you would have all these things except Agrippa I just wish that you didn't have these chains that I have on he cared he saw he he saw that there could be hope in this man this evil man and that's the way we should look at everyone never look down on anyone always always cultivate that crop and then you watch figs will start to grow they'll do it that I can promise because the Bible says it [Music] Daniel all throughout my history faithfulness has walked beside the winter stor Make Way for spring into every season from where I'm standing I see the evidence of your goodness all over my life all over my life I see your promises and fulfillment all over my life all over my life for when I'm we the fear may come the fear will leave you lead my heart to [Applause] Victory You Are My Strength and you always bu me and I see the evidence of your goodness all over my life all over my life and I see promises in fulfillment all over my life all over my life see the cross the empty grave the evidence is endless all my sins rolled away because of you oh Jesus see the cross the empty grave the evidence is endless all my sins rolled away because of you oh Jesus Oh and I see the evidence of your goodness all over my life all over my life and I see promises in fulfillment all over my heart and all over my life Jesus Christ believes in each one of you he believes in me and he'll never stop fighting for me I may stop and I may leave but he'll never stop from me one day that tree may be cut [Music] down but then there will be others because of the efforts of one of us there's going to be others that bear fruit that are a blessing to so many and I believe that there are those that are in this building right now I believe that those there are those that are in this audience that just with a little bit of love just with a little bit of cultivating around the base that God will have them bear fruit amen think about someone not yourself think about someone that needs that that needs that help that needs that love and then you be that vine dresser so you be that that laborer in the field you be that person that will clean up around the bottom of that base and let the water get to it the fertilizer get to it let it and make it bear fruit brother Paul if you come brother Paul Murray come in closing in prayer Daniel let's continue and I see the evidence of your goodness all over my life all over my life and I see your promises and fulfillment all over my life all over my life all throughout my history faithfulness is walked beside me the wind of stor W for spe and every season from where I'm stand and I see the evidence of your goodness all over my life all over my life I see promises in fulfillment all over my life all over my life [Music] let me tell you something I fumbled through here's the enemy he he me takes my notes away and and he wanted to hinder this service there's been a number of things that were not normal that have hindered this service this morning but there's somebody here and and I think that there's many here that there was that Jesus Christ believed in that person and he dug around using us you and me and he dug around that tree and now it's time to bear fruit been praying for this young man as many of you have for a while let me tell you something I see in him I see a calling in his life I've told Daniel the first day I met him that there's something special about this young man and now he says I want to give my heart to the Lord [Applause] [Music] Jesus me microphone [Music] and I don't know what to say this feeling just came over me today and and it just it feels real strong I've been having I don't know if it's a vision or if it's just God speaking to me uh it's this feeling where where I see my loved ones or my parents specifically and there's some place peaceful and they're looking down on me and they're and I'm not there with them and it's a scary feeling and I just my fear is that one day that'll come true and I don't want that to happen man it's a takes a lot for a grown man to cry but the the love of God is real and I feel it here today [Applause] [Music] yeah if you could show them up the Hano going through a hard time he's limping he's in extreme pain he put it off it's a long time getting his leg amputated God chose this day what's the most important thing is that you come to Jesus Christ that is the most important thing and look at Jesus and he digs around and he takes care of us and he loves us and he knows that one day this fruit will be born and then it comes out we bear that fruit in the name of Jesus Christ brother AR is there water in the pool I say we baptize him he has to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and they were cut in their heart Acts chapter 2 the sermon went forth and they were cut in their heart and they said Peter what do we do we want we want this same thing that you have and Peter said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the washing away of your sins and then you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost then you shall bear [Music] fruit 150 people however many we are here today we saw it are we going to see more Rebecca it's a good time to give your heart to the Lord Jesus brother Silas it's a good time praise God

con to work on this young man's heart today and work on really many hearts that are in the audience today Paul said he said I have I have planted he said apollis watered you see the the unity of the ministry you see the unity of the of the people I have planted apollis watered but God gave the increase God is the one that caused the fruit to be born this this young man has loving parents wonderful parents he has loving family where is um where's your brother brother you remember talking with me I baptized this young man a camp in a pond up in the mountains and he had it on his heart he says I don't want to be baptized unless my brother is baptized is that right nah and he asked me he said what should I do and I said brother you do what's on your heart and he says I want to be baptized and in that in that situation it bothered me that I couldn't be the rle model that I needed to be and after today I want to be that role model [Applause] biblical and we are baptized not into a church but we are baptized into the body of Jesus Christ so when you are baptized you take on that name of Jesus Christ and you say Lord now I am going to represent you now the fruit that I bear is going to be the fruit of Jesus Christ that is what baptism means do you commit to that I do 100% [Applause] brother cleano by your own confession I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you
