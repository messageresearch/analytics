[12:27] it was just a good spirit so good to be

[12:40] she was feeling much better and was
[12:43] thanking for her prayer and we I heard

[12:59] I know it's that time of the year but I
[13:01] I know a God that's greater than
[13:03] whatever is going around whatever is
[13:05] happening so brother Josiah would you

[13:25] open PR let's all pray
[13:29] dear Jesus we love you so
[13:34] much there's nowhere better to be than
[13:36] in your

[13:40] tonight we'd like to invite you to be
[13:42] with us
[13:44] tonight may you be pleased with our
[13:46] worship
[13:48] Lord Lord if there be any sick here I
[13:51] pray that your Holy Spirit would move
[13:53] through this building Lord and even now
[13:55] just begin to
[13:57] touch anyone out on the streaming Lord
[14:00] Jesus that that may be sick I pray that
[14:03] your Holy Ghost would be present there
[14:05] as well and touch those who are in need
[14:08] Lord as brother Aaron said there's
[14:11] things going around but our God is
[14:14] greater we're so thankful Lord Jesus for
[14:17] all you've
[14:18] done pray that you'd anoint brother
[14:20] Daniel as he comes tonight Lord Jesus
[14:22] may he speak words not of his own not
[14:26] words from a man but may they be
[14:28] directly from the presence of the Lord
[14:30] may you speak through him freely Lord
[14:33] Jesus and may we hear from the Lord
[14:36] Jesus not from Brother
[14:38] Daniel we love you very much
[14:41] Lord we give you the rest of this
[14:43] service all of it to your glory in Jesus
[14:47] name
[14:50] amen amen little
[14:54] testimony got home uh on Sunday evening
[14:58] and noticed the furnace wasn't
[15:01] working and you know those of us who
[15:04] live in this temperature when it comes
[15:06] down a little bit we get cold right
[15:08] away and uh we couldn't get it to work
[15:11] so I got a hold of brother brother Mike
[15:13] Walters and he came over yesterday
[15:15] morning to look at it and he told me
[15:18] you're going to need a new furnace it
[15:21] broke inside and he said the gas is
[15:23] going out and the Flames are going out
[15:26] sideways and I noticed that it kept
[15:28] turning on on but not really warming
[15:30] up and it had melted the control
[15:34] panel and then it wasn't until after I
[15:37] was driving after he told us the news
[15:38] and everything of course you're
[15:40] disappointed but he said you know you
[15:42] could have caught your whole house on
[15:44] fire if it hadn't burned out that
[15:46] control panel and kept
[15:49] going with where the gases would have
[15:51] gone and where the fire you could have
[15:52] burned your house down so I thought
[15:55] about that I said Lord you know even
[15:56] causing that way you still watch over us
[15:59] what could have been a a major disaster
[16:02] so I said you know in all things give
[16:05] God praise you ask me why I'm happy and

[32:34] seeing sister Katie walk up to the organ

[32:44] young as you were giving your talents to
[32:46] the Lord Jesus I appreciate you
[32:49] appreciate your family sister Katie I'm
[32:51] going to be talking
[32:53] tonight tonight's going to be a little
[32:55] different I'm going to be just reading a
[32:56] lot lot of quotes we're trying to get
[32:58] ready for an election brother Kim is
[33:02] that brother Kim dingwall there brother
[33:04] God bless you I'm sorry I I was a mids
[33:07] sentence and I looked over there and see
[33:09] you and your precious wife I met you
[33:11] last year at Easter time I believe God
[33:14] bless you brother it's it's good it's
[33:16] good to have you um but uh back to
[33:19] Sister Katie I'll be talking about
[33:21] deacons and um trustees and pastors
[33:25] orders of service sister Katie comes
[33:27] from very very good stock if I've ever
[33:30] met a deacon in my life it's her dad
[33:32] brother Joel Robson he is the um really
[33:37] the definition that you see in this book
[33:39] of a deacon so sister it's good to have
[33:41] you here brother brother Josiah brother
[33:44] Kim is
[33:46] um a
[33:48] uh has a has a very good reputation also
[33:52] and all that you've done up done up at
[33:54] uh up in Canada and and the work that
[33:56] you've done and how many Souls that have
[33:58] been touched by your ministry by all
[34:01] that's been done up there so welcome
[34:03] we're honored to have you
[34:05] here I um I want to announce also as as
[34:09] you know that we have our church
[34:10] election coming this
[34:12] Sunday um we uh a very very important
[34:15] time it's important time for me because
[34:19] I've just felt like this is something
[34:21] that we've needed to have for a while
[34:25] now as I said
[34:28] last um Sunday evening I believe it was
[34:32] that this
[34:34] church had a founding pastor and I
[34:38] believe a founding pastor and a pastor
[34:41] that succeeds that founding Pastor are
[34:44] two different things and I believe that
[34:46] we can handle things differently brother
[34:48] green was a founding Pastor he came here
[34:51] he risked everything following the the
[34:54] leading of the Lord started this church
[34:57] and I believe the deacons and trustees
[35:00] also the prophet laid it out and I want
[35:03] to read to you something I said
[35:05] something last Sunday that I really felt
[35:09] from the bottom of my my heart I felt
[35:11] like if we can get these things in order
[35:14] that I believe the Lord will bless us
[35:17] now listen to this listen to what
[35:18] brother brandom said here he said now I
[35:20] want to say
[35:22] too I see brother Egan and many some of
[35:25] the trustees setting here after we had
[35:28] our trustee meeting the other night it
[35:30] is true I publicly before the church
[35:33] that each one of you are no longer
[35:36] appointed
[35:38] trustees you are elected trustees and
[35:42] your name is on the books all right and
[35:46] now they're going to have some more
[35:48] elections of deacons and so forth and
[35:50] brother Neville is we'll be calling
[35:52] those immediately after this service all
[35:55] right and for the treasure and so forth
[35:56] forth as we set the church up get it all
[36:02] backgrounds ready then we can have a
[36:06] Revival as it comes
[36:08] on that I found that quote today and boy
[36:12] it meant the world to me because I felt
[36:16] like that and I said it and now here it
[36:19] is the prophet vindicating what was on
[36:22] my heart so I'm I'm really really
[36:25] grateful that we do have this
[36:27] opportunity we live in a free country
[36:29] that we can come together that we can
[36:31] elect our own pastors we can elect our
[36:33] own deacons and offices of the church
[36:36] and we should never take that for
[36:38] granted leadership as I've been
[36:40] preaching on the Book of
[36:42] Judges
[36:44] leadership not only in the country but
[36:47] also in the church is very very
[36:51] important I know a brother that recently
[36:54] and this just happened he was recently
[36:57] voted out of the church now they had a
[37:00] church it was like 30
[37:02] people and what had happened was this
[37:06] brother who was in the pastor the the
[37:09] pastor of the church someone had taken a
[37:12] picture and he was in the picture and
[37:13] there was some sort of a light in the
[37:16] picture and they brought that that
[37:19] picture to the pastor and they said what
[37:22] do you think about this don't you think
[37:24] that looks like the pillar of fire and
[37:26] the pastor said yeah it does look like
[37:28] the pillar of
[37:29] fire so what happened was after that
[37:33] they started passing the picture around
[37:35] and some of the people in the church got
[37:36] offended at that because the picture
[37:38] didn't have the right coloring in it it
[37:40] wasn't the right shape it didn't look
[37:42] right so they said well the pastor's
[37:44] lying about this stuff so turmoil in the
[37:48] church and they voted the pastor out is
[37:52] that not
[37:53] ridiculous now I'm not saying that it's
[37:56] a congregation's fault and I'm not
[37:58] saying it's the pastor's fault but that
[38:00] church did not have Unity if something
[38:03] like that can come in and divide the
[38:06] church and have the church vote the
[38:09] pastor out then there is something wrong
[38:11] in that church and that's why with our
[38:14] church I want to make sure that we are
[38:16] doing everything right and everything in
[38:19] line with the Lord and the way that he
[38:21] set things out so that we won't have
[38:24] those problems if there is a problem we
[38:27] can address those problems as the word
[38:30] tells us and we can move forward as a
[38:33] congregation as a family as loved ones
[38:37] and not have this
[38:39] Division and that takes
[38:42] leadership and that's what we are going
[38:44] to be doing this weekend is we're going
[38:46] to be electing leadership for this
[38:49] church I've seen so
[38:53] many
[38:55] problems
[38:57] with
[39:00] how a church May split or be divided and
[39:05] one thing that I want to point out is we
[39:08] need to use
[39:09] caution the Bible plainly says about the
[39:13] sisters that a sister is not meant to
[39:18] handle the word of God now we all know
[39:22] that and we can point our finger at
[39:24] Joyce Meyers and all these telang IST
[39:26] and all that but that doesn't do us any
[39:28] good to point our fingers at other
[39:30] famous evangelists what we need to do is
[39:33] we need to look
[39:34] within and say okay now what are we
[39:39] doing and how are these maybe sisters
[39:42] taking a little bit more Authority not
[39:45] so much in the church but in their
[39:47] families that's why it is very very
[39:50] important that we need to have holy
[39:53] spirit filled God called fathers
[39:58] Brothers men of God that know this book
[40:03] that are willing to lead their families
[40:05] willing to spend the time in prayer
[40:08] willing to spend the time studying
[40:10] willing to spend the time listening so
[40:13] they can not only lead their families
[40:15] but they can help out in the church they
[40:17] can be deacons they can be trustees they
[40:19] can be pastors they can help but we have
[40:23] to as men we have to live up to this
[40:26] calling that we have the Bible very
[40:29] plainly
[40:30] says that the
[40:33] man is the head of the woman as Christ
[40:36] is the head of the man so if we are
[40:39] looking at Christ and how great he is
[40:43] and all of the wisdom our lord Jesus has
[40:46] and all of his compassion on us and how
[40:48] perfect he is then we need to live up to
[40:52] our calling as being the head of the
[40:55] woman I'm not not putting the women down
[40:58] here I'm telling the men need to step it
[41:02] up every one of us live a life worthy of
[41:06] this gospel and worthy of the calling
[41:09] that you have as a dad as a husband as a
[41:14] brother live worthy of that calling amen
[41:18] and then the
[41:19] sisters give your husband give your
[41:23] father give him that resp
[41:26] respect that the Bible wants him to
[41:31] have let's um I want to read a few
[41:35] quotes before we get started into these
[41:38] offices and it's something that with
[41:41] this
[41:42] church and I've I've observed this
[41:46] church over the years and I observed
[41:48] observed how sometimes splits happen in
[41:51] the church and we have to be
[41:55] careful about what we are Desiring from
[41:59] a
[42:00] church now let me preface this by saying
[42:03] I think our church is too
[42:07] quiet the carnal the Flesh in me says
[42:11] that it's a lot easier to preach to a
[42:15] church that where you get some
[42:17] feedback it just is it's just it's just
[42:20] easier to do that maybe it's tradition
[42:24] that we're so quiet maybe it's
[42:26] personalities of the people who are here
[42:28] maybe it's that much of our congregation
[42:30] is
[42:31] new and they don't have the confidence
[42:34] to enter in maybe it's because we're not
[42:36] where we should be with the Lord or
[42:38] maybe it is because we are where we
[42:40] should be with the Lord just want to
[42:42] make sure that we are always we're not
[42:45] seeking something that the Lord doesn't
[42:47] necessarily want now I'm going to read a
[42:49] few quotes and I'm not going to
[42:51] necessarily put my interpretations on
[42:53] these um we'll start with the church in
[42:56] its
[42:57] condition brother Jeremy and I have some
[42:59] real loyal F Royal friends here that are
[43:02] very fine people they're very loyal to
[43:05] go to church no matter how cold it is
[43:08] they'll wrap up in a blanket and sit on
[43:10] a bob sled and drive the horse for 30
[43:12] miles to get to
[43:17] church dramatic pause
[43:22] there they'll walk through the snow
[43:24] drifts and everything else young and old
[43:27] they'll all group together and one
[43:28] family gets the other and they'll start
[43:30] walking and they go it's the sacrifices
[43:34] that they make is what causes them to
[43:36] get so much out of the
[43:39] service when there's no sacrifice
[43:42] there's not very much to the service you
[43:45] have to really get down and do something
[43:48] that hurts real bad have to lay aside
[43:50] something and stop the work and do this
[43:53] or that to get to go to church and show
[43:57] God that you love him and you make a
[44:00] sacrifice to go it's then when you get
[44:02] something out of it my
[44:05] family my dad my grandfather drove all
[44:09] over the
[44:11] country to hear brother Brandon preach
[44:15] you didn't obviously they didn't have
[44:16] the internet and all that back then but
[44:18] I think it was seven 750 miles one way
[44:23] that they would drive every every Sunday
[44:26] they they drive for every the week for
[44:28] the weekend they'd come back get home at
[44:31] 4: or5 in the morning and then go to
[44:34] work work all week to get enough money
[44:35] to buy gas to go back up to the meetings
[44:38] and brother Kim they they greatly
[44:40] benefited from
[44:41] it but I believe in the supreme
[44:43] authority is the next quote I believe in
[44:45] the supreme authority of the local
[44:48] assembly yes Let each Church be its own
[44:50] choose its Pastor its deacons it's
[44:53] whatever it is and then that way the man
[44:55] in there there has no Bishop over him
[44:58] the Holy Spirit wants to speak something
[45:00] to that church they don't have to ask
[45:02] anybody about whether they could do this
[45:04] or do that it's the individual in
[45:07] contact with the Holy Spirit show me by
[45:10] the Bible what's greater in the
[45:12] Bible than the local elder or local
[45:16] church that's right yes sir sovereignty
[45:18] of the local church each Church in
[45:21] itself now Brotherhood that's wonderful
[45:23] all churches ought to be in brotherhood
[45:25] like that together but the Sovereign
[45:28] sovereignty of the local church notice
[45:31] Paul being a great Master teacher well
[45:34] trained on his road down to Damascus one
[45:36] day to arrest the people that were in
[45:39] his that were in this new way now he was
[45:42] sincere God does not judge you by your
[45:46] sincerity I never seen any more sincere
[45:50] people than the heathens many of them
[45:52] even kill their own children in vain for
[45:55] sacrifice to to an idol it is not the
[45:57] sincerity it shows you how important our
[46:00] Doctrine
[46:03] is all of these are leading up to
[46:07] speaking about the offices of the church
[46:10] Jesus told them after they had been next
[46:11] quote you can just leave the quotes up
[46:13] brother brother Jeremy I'm going to read
[46:14] quite a few of them Jesus just told them
[46:17] after they had been with him oh they
[46:18] ought they'd been out rejoicing they
[46:21] came back the Devils was subject unto
[46:23] them he said you're not ready yet go up
[46:26] to Jerusalem and wait till you're filled
[46:28] up you make too much noise and have all
[46:32] Steam and nothing it'll go out the
[46:35] whistle and you won't have any steam to
[46:37] roll the
[46:38] wheels we can testify and jump up and
[46:41] down and sing and everything like that
[46:43] but until God makes us in such a
[46:46] condition till we can recognize one
[46:48] another as Brethren until all malice
[46:51] Envy strife and everything has gone out
[46:52] of us our jumping shouting praising God
[46:56] organizing speaking in tongues and
[46:58] healing the sick and Performing Miracles
[47:00] and everything else will never amount to
[47:03] nothing come back and wait in the cave
[47:05] till we hear the still Small Voice that
[47:08] calls us to the S to to the service of
[47:11] God oh how we need it how the world
[47:14] needs it we need that God will provide
[47:19] I'm going to be talking about be careful
[47:21] about seeking that emotion we don't seek
[47:26] the emotion don't get emotion and the
[47:28] Holy Spirit mixed up the Holy Spirit
[47:31] does often produce
[47:34] emotion but don't think the emotion is
[47:37] the holy
[47:39] spirit I said sure next quote I said
[47:43] sure if they won't make the wheel roll
[47:45] right they've got to blow it out the
[47:47] whistle somewhere they've got a lot of
[47:49] steam I said and that's the truth if
[47:51] this Pentecostal Church would take a lot
[47:54] of its praises and put put it to work it
[47:56] would do something for the kingdom of
[47:59] God God give you the Holy Ghost you like
[48:03] to Shout by it and praised by it but
[48:06] just put that into gifts and wonders and
[48:09] go out on the street and get Sinners to
[48:11] come in and things like that your church
[48:14] will grow and everything will go along
[48:17] go along all right don't blow it out the
[48:19] whistle put it into action and make the
[48:22] wheel roll the gospel train
[48:26] next quote that's what I've always said
[48:29] about the two classes of people I meet
[48:31] the fundamental and the Pentecost the
[48:34] fundamentalists seen positionally from
[48:36] their schooling they know where they
[48:38] stand but they haven't got no faith the
[48:41] Pentecostals got the faith but don't
[48:44] know who they are see like I said
[48:47] somebody has got money in the bank can't
[48:49] write a check another one write a check
[48:52] got no money in the bank get them
[48:54] together wow I love that shows that God
[48:58] has a variety as I was preaching last
[48:59] weekend now we see that the Pentecostals
[49:03] is the one that's got the faith they
[49:04] believe it but they're full of fire
[49:07] they're but they're full of fire they're
[49:10] full of the Holy Ghost but they don't
[49:12] know how to settle down on the word on
[49:15] that word and say it's thus sayeth the
[49:17] Lord they blow it all out the whistle
[49:20] with screams and shouts and runs if they
[49:23] could ever throttle it down you see a
[49:26] church stand on her feet in power and
[49:29] Glory where there would be a book of
[49:32] Acts wrote
[49:34] behind I'm going keep going on the next
[49:36] quote but what the church needs tonight
[49:39] is to know how to control these gifts
[49:42] see for evil spirits can come in and
[49:45] speak just the same as good spirits can
[49:48] speak you know that and you must have
[49:51] the spirit of discernment to know that
[49:55] they have had it in the Bible times why
[49:58] if they didn't do it why did Paul say
[50:00] Let One judge and and the people judge
[50:04] so so forth those gifts of Prophecy
[50:07] everything is supposed to be correctly
[50:09] put in order for Satan can imitate every
[50:12] gift that God's
[50:15] got every gift he can imitate it and you
[50:18] must know the right and wrong and by its
[50:21] fruits you know it watch whether it
[50:24] comes to pass and whether it's truth or
[50:28] not and that's the way you know the
[50:31] spirit how many false prophets when
[50:35] Jesus whenever Jesus was talking about
[50:37] the end time it it seemed like he always
[50:39] said don't be
[50:43] deceived when he says in the last days
[50:46] when Paul says in the last days perilous
[50:48] times shall
[50:49] come how many times have we heard don't
[50:52] be deceived so if we are in those those
[50:55] times we know that there must be
[50:58] deceivers Among
[51:00] Us I'm not talking
[51:03] about Benny hen and T
[51:06] evangelists those Brothers I don't know
[51:08] I don't know what's right or wrong that
[51:10] don't have anything to do with me I'm
[51:11] talking about right here Among
[51:16] Us
[51:18] Cain was such a person as that he was
[51:22] very religious indeed now if religion is
[51:26] all that you have to have then God was
[51:29] unjust by condemning Cain because he was
[51:32] religious he was just as religious and
[51:35] sincere as Abel was now remember he
[51:38] thought of God he worshiped God he had a
[51:42] church he built an altar he made a
[51:44] sacrifice he prayed he worshiped but he
[51:47] was
[51:48] rejected no matter how Esau was also see
[51:52] religion see that is Satan Satan's
[51:55] business not to kill the whole thing but
[51:58] just to contaminate it that's all he
[52:02] ain't going to kill the whole thing oh
[52:04] no not Communists no not the Antichrist
[52:07] is not communism the Bible said it would
[52:09] deceive the very elect the elect if it
[52:12] was
[52:14] possible one more now I've mentioned be
[52:19] careful don't necessarily seek the gifts
[52:24] seek the GI
[52:25] of the gifts and then those things will
[52:28] come now listen to this now how do we
[52:30] handle it if we see maybe error in the
[52:34] church but here in the
[52:37] Tabernacle we want you all to know these
[52:40] things here when God begins to pour out
[52:43] the Holy Spirit upon the
[52:46] people sometimes I know I've seen people
[52:48] get in the
[52:50] flesh when they were under the anointing
[52:54] of the spirit Spirit I've seen them go
[52:56] to extremes with things but don't you
[53:00] say nothing about it you respect it you
[53:04] bow your head you might not understand
[53:07] it neither would I this is a prophet
[53:10] speaking neither would I but I want to
[53:14] respect it anyhow now we must have
[53:17] respects to God and when God pours out
[53:19] the Holy
[53:21] Spirit I just say thank I just say thank
[53:24] you Heavenly Father you are doing
[53:26] something for that poor precious soul
[53:28] that wants to come to you to your home
[53:31] like I do someday do you see the love
[53:35] that brother Brandon presented do you
[53:36] see the patience that he he presented so
[53:39] when we get when we do something wrong
[53:42] or maybe we get the Lord might touch Us
[53:44] in the spirit and we get excited and we
[53:46] might take it somewhere where he didn't
[53:48] want it to go have patience with that
[53:52] person but let's also
[53:56] not be afraid to praise the Lord to
[53:59] shout in the spirit don't be afraid to
[54:02] do that but also temper it with is this
[54:06] the holy
[54:08] spirit always and don't take it where
[54:11] the Lord doesn't want it to
[54:16] go as I said I look back at the splits
[54:19] in these different
[54:20] churches and many times it's because the
[54:24] people have wanted more emotion in the
[54:27] worship but those people who wanted
[54:31] that followed after Ministries who
[54:34] strayed often strayed from the word and
[54:37] made something of themselves that they
[54:39] were not as I said they made many of
[54:42] them would say that they were
[54:45] prophets and then prophesied
[54:48] falsely many of them and they're out
[54:54] there
[54:55] my point in saying this is if we see a
[54:58] deficiency in this church I I've I've
[55:01] mentioned things that I I would like the
[55:04] Lord to
[55:06] provide you might the pastor might be
[55:11] gifted in handling the word but he may
[55:14] not be a Gifted Man In Worship or the
[55:18] pastor may be a Gifted Man in
[55:22] leadership and he may not be a gifted
[55:25] man in being able to expound on the word
[55:28] but that's why God sends gifts into the
[55:30] church some Apostles and Prophets and
[55:32] evangelists and teachers and pastors he
[55:34] sends these gifts he sends worship
[55:36] leaders he sends the different offices
[55:39] of the church to help the body one man
[55:42] can't do it
[55:44] all as I said last week God's
[55:49] plan is like a
[55:51] puzzle and you dump the puzzle out on
[55:53] the table and you have all these
[55:54] different people pieces and you start
[55:56] picking them up and you you can't they
[55:57] don't fit But as time goes on you can
[56:01] put these puzzles in the right put these
[56:03] pieces of puzzle in the right place and
[56:05] then the Masterpiece starts to form and
[56:08] every single piece has its own
[56:12] place and no peace is any bigger than
[56:16] any other no peace is any more important
[56:19] than any other they all have to be
[56:22] placed before the Masterpiece is
[56:24] finished and that's the way our church
[56:27] if we are deficient in something pray
[56:31] that the Lord will send it to us we're
[56:34] together in this if I'm weak in certain
[56:38] ways ask the Lord to help me if you're
[56:41] weak in certain ways I'm asking the Lord
[56:43] to help you we need to be together and
[56:46] move forward in this as a
[56:50] team now let's get into the church
[56:53] offices and again this is isn't like one
[56:56] of my normal sermons I'm reading a lot
[56:58] of quotes and I'm going to continue to
[57:00] read a couple more here because as I
[57:02] said before these offices in the
[57:06] church they're not necessarily defined
[57:09] very plainly in the Bible but we can all
[57:13] rest on brother brandom's message and we
[57:16] can take brother brandom where we can't
[57:19] pull out of the Bible we can take
[57:20] brother brandom there and say this is
[57:24] the guidance that we
[57:29] have this is an extended quote but it's
[57:31] it's a quote
[57:33] that and I'd encourage you to listen to
[57:35] Hebrews chapter 7 and the whole Hebrews
[57:37] series is uh is really nice brother Bram
[57:40] talks about a lot about church order
[57:42] there but Hebrews chapter 7 number two
[57:45] I'm going to read this extended
[57:46] quote it says
[57:50] this by the way while I'm speaking
[57:53] somebody around this country somewhere
[57:55] is guilty of writing some cards to move
[57:57] brother Neville out of this
[57:59] Pulpit you're going to have to settle
[58:01] that with me now the reason I read that
[58:04] part is this is Brother bram's church
[58:08] this is the brandham Tabernacle brother
[58:10] brandham was there and they obviously
[58:14] even them had some issues so have
[58:18] patience it's it's okay if we have I
[58:21] think that we've had a beautiful time so
[58:23] far I haven't had any we haven't had any
[58:25] big problems but they might come brother
[58:28] Kim do you think they pretty much all of
[58:30] them have problems don't they
[58:34] but right so they might come but I'm
[58:37] just right
[58:38] here even the brandom Tabernacle with
[58:41] brother brandom there you're going to
[58:43] have to settle that with me uhhuh that's
[58:46] right yes indeed now I want
[58:49] you something about the Deacon board the
[58:51] Deacon board has not one thing to do
[58:53] with that Pastor no sir now we're
[58:55] getting into church order the
[58:57] congregation in full has the authority
[59:00] it isn't a deacon board is just the
[59:02] policeman here in this church just to
[59:05] keep order and so forth but when it
[59:07] comes to rules the whole church has to
[59:10] say so the church is built upon the
[59:13] sovereignty of the local church
[59:17] therefore I have nothing to say in
[59:19] moving this pastor or putting one in I
[59:21] own the property it's given to the
[59:23] church you all are the church you people
[59:26] are the one who control you're the
[59:28] church yourself and the church the Holy
[59:30] Church of God is the sovereignty of the
[59:32] holy spirit in that church the only
[59:35] thing I do is on the property give it
[59:38] give it over to this church as I give it
[59:40] over for a church and it's tax-free and
[59:43] the church elects their own pastors I
[59:46] have nothing to do with it and that's
[59:48] the only way no Deacon board can do it
[59:50] the Deacon board only keeps order and
[59:53] things in the church the the trustees
[59:55] they have nothing to do with it only
[59:57] repair the church they can't do it until
[1:00:00] there's the whole trustee board meets
[1:00:02] and says we'll build this or we'll do
[1:00:04] that then they have to ask the treasur
[1:00:07] if they got the money to do it yes sir
[1:00:09] but if there's a complaint against any
[1:00:11] member if a member has a complaint
[1:00:13] against one another or something wrong
[1:00:15] you're supposed to go to that brother
[1:00:17] yourself and talk to him you and he
[1:00:23] alone right there let me just keep my
[1:00:26] place right there Jesus said the same
[1:00:29] thing he said if you have a if a brother
[1:00:32] sins against you he said tell no one and
[1:00:36] go to that person how many of us live up
[1:00:37] to that here again brother brandom is
[1:00:40] saying that then if they won't receive
[1:00:42] it then the next thing takes place you
[1:00:44] take one of the deacons or somebody and
[1:00:46] go with you to that brother then if he
[1:00:48] won't receive you then you come and tell
[1:00:51] it to the church then if the church then
[1:00:54] if he w't won't receive the church then
[1:00:55] the Bible says let them be as a heathen
[1:00:57] and a Publican that's right and any
[1:00:59] person that knows a guilty person and
[1:01:02] you don't go to them and talk then
[1:01:05] you're the part of the Church of God is
[1:01:08] going to answer for that sin then you're
[1:01:11] part of the Church of God you are going
[1:01:14] to answer for that
[1:01:16] sin that's right and if and if any
[1:01:19] persons then has a complaint against a
[1:01:21] deacon or against the Deacon or somebody
[1:01:23] in the church it takes three people
[1:01:25] three people would come and say
[1:01:27] witness the mouth of two or three
[1:01:30] Witnesses come tell the pastor that
[1:01:32] there's a grievance against a deacon
[1:01:34] then if there's a grievance against a
[1:01:35] deacon the Deacon isn't a just man or
[1:01:38] isn't a perfect man he must hold the
[1:01:39] office of a deacon blameless and then
[1:01:41] found blameless and if that congregation
[1:01:44] finds out that the Deacon is not holding
[1:01:46] that office he gets three with them and
[1:01:49] takes to takes it to the pastor that
[1:01:52] Deacon is asked to stay home overnight
[1:01:54] night and then the pastor comes and
[1:01:57] brings the congregation together gives
[1:01:59] the grievance and if the congregation
[1:02:01] votes for the Deacon to continue on the
[1:02:04] Deacon continues on if he if votes for
[1:02:08] the Deacon to be dismissed they elect a
[1:02:10] new Deacon that very night see therefore
[1:02:13] no one person has nothing to do in this
[1:02:16] it's the majority of the people yes sir
[1:02:18] if 20 votes for him and 21 votes against
[1:02:22] him he goes or vice versa that is the
[1:02:24] sovereignty of the local church and then
[1:02:27] each one of the members has to has has a
[1:02:29] say so in the church anything goes on
[1:02:33] wrong then they can come right around
[1:02:36] and the only thing they have to do is to
[1:02:39] be before God that they are absolutely
[1:02:42] see that nothing hinders the moving of
[1:02:45] the church but the full and complete
[1:02:47] authority of the church is the pastor
[1:02:49] read that in the Bible see if it's not
[1:02:51] Bible order that's exactly right there's
[1:02:53] no one above the Elder I have nothing to
[1:02:54] do with what brother Neville does here
[1:02:56] that's up to you and brother Neville if
[1:02:58] brother Neville wanted to preach Jehovah
[1:03:00] Witness Doctrine that's up to you and
[1:03:02] him and you see if he wanted to preach
[1:03:04] anything he wanted to that's between you
[1:03:07] and him that's all if the congregation
[1:03:09] votes for him in there to preach that
[1:03:11] that's all right that's up to him the
[1:03:13] only thing that I do is just owning the
[1:03:15] property and if somebody and if
[1:03:17] something another comes up that's like
[1:03:21] moving the pastor and they want to take
[1:03:23] a vote on that you couldn't ask a deacon
[1:03:25] to do that you'd come ask me I'd come
[1:03:28] down and say if you want to move the
[1:03:30] pastor tell me why has he done anything
[1:03:32] yes we caught him drunk or we caught him
[1:03:34] doing things doing this or doing
[1:03:37] something that wasn't right have you got
[1:03:40] three Witnesses of it yes we have do you
[1:03:42] see
[1:03:43] how let me stop right there you see how
[1:03:46] messed up it was about that picture and
[1:03:49] misinterpreting that picture brother
[1:03:51] bram's talking about a man cheating on
[1:03:53] his wife for going out and getting drunk
[1:03:55] or doing all that and the brother
[1:03:57] misinterpreted a
[1:04:00] picture and the church was in such
[1:04:03] disunity that they voted him out for
[1:04:06] it um them Witnesses must first be tried
[1:04:10] don't receive an accusation against an
[1:04:11] elder L It Be by two or three Witnesses
[1:04:14] and let them first be proved against the
[1:04:15] Elder then you have to swear it that you
[1:04:18] saw it and proved it I'll
[1:04:20] um I'll go down to the last paragraph
[1:04:23] brother J me 2933 now coming to this
[1:04:26] blessed old message here now you now I
[1:04:30] want you to know that this is tape
[1:04:33] recorded remember this message and the
[1:04:34] tape recordings of the church the orders
[1:04:36] of and rules of the church is on tape
[1:04:38] recording that's according to the Bible
[1:04:40] we don't run it there's nobody in head
[1:04:43] no all we're all the same but we got a
[1:04:46] leader that is the pastor as long as
[1:04:48] he's led by the Holy Holy Ghost that's
[1:04:50] true now one more quote before I get
[1:04:53] into the office of the
[1:04:54] Pastor now each one of these has things
[1:04:58] in common and I think that your meeting
[1:05:00] should not be to not be together but it
[1:05:03] should be as each office because the
[1:05:05] deacons has nothing to do nothing to say
[1:05:08] to the trustees unless they got some
[1:05:10] business to present to them and vice
[1:05:12] versa the trustees is over the finance
[1:05:15] and things of the building they have
[1:05:16] nothing with the deacons the deacons are
[1:05:20] the policemen of the church and they are
[1:05:22] assistants to the pastor and the
[1:05:24] trustees is holding of all and the
[1:05:27] trustees is the holding of all the
[1:05:29] property the trustees has nothing to do
[1:05:31] with the spiritual end of it and the
[1:05:33] Deacon has nothing to do with the
[1:05:35] financial end of it therefore it must be
[1:05:39] in the Sunday School Superintendent is
[1:05:41] over Sunday school so the reason I read
[1:05:44] that in depth is because really of all
[1:05:48] the research that I've done and it's
[1:05:49] been really Decades of of searching that
[1:05:52] quote that I read brother brandom
[1:05:54] addresses pretty much everything in that
[1:05:57] long quote so now we are educated to
[1:06:01] what the prophet said we know the
[1:06:04] difference between a deacon and a
[1:06:05] trustee now let's dig into the Bible and
[1:06:09] we will see the qualifications here 1
[1:06:12] Timothy chapter
[1:06:15] 3 verse
[1:06:18] one this is a true saying now this is
[1:06:21] Timothy this is Paul writing to
[1:06:24] Timothy and he's giving him instructions
[1:06:27] on how to manage this church and how to
[1:06:31] CH choose the church
[1:06:34] officials this is a true saying if a man
[1:06:36] desire the office of a bishop he
[1:06:38] desireth a good work now I'm making the
[1:06:41] Assumption here that almost every B
[1:06:43] Bible scholar makes and
[1:06:46] that's and I believe I can completely
[1:06:48] back this up with the scripture that
[1:06:50] office of a bishop means an overseer or
[1:06:53] a lead leader or a local priest or a
[1:06:56] pastor he is the leader of the church a
[1:06:59] bishop then must be blameless I'll
[1:07:02] address that in a minute the husband of
[1:07:04] one wife that the man is loyal to his
[1:07:06] wife and has only one wife and back when
[1:07:10] it was written I assume that it was
[1:07:11] probably legal to have more than one
[1:07:15] wife but today this means that that man
[1:07:19] cannot be
[1:07:22] divorced
[1:07:24] Vigilant every other translation I read
[1:07:27] says temperent he doesn't have a bad
[1:07:29] temper and he's has control Sober Sober
[1:07:33] is respectable and of good behavior
[1:07:35] given to hospitality and apt to teach
[1:07:38] that word apt means able
[1:07:42] now able to teach this pastor must be a
[1:07:48] preacher now this is something that has
[1:07:51] gone on in the message and especially
[1:07:53] lately
[1:07:54] where a man is trying to govern a church
[1:07:58] trying to Pastor a church and this man
[1:08:00] is not a Gifted Man in the scriptures
[1:08:02] he's not able to preach as it says right
[1:08:05] here he takes the office of a
[1:08:08] pastor and then he either streams
[1:08:12] in another Pastor or he just plays tapes
[1:08:17] now if he wants to just play tapes
[1:08:20] that's up to him and whatever is good
[1:08:22] for the congregation but he must be able
[1:08:25] to dig into this word and preach the
[1:08:28] gospel it is a
[1:08:30] requirement here and if he is not able
[1:08:32] to do that he can't be a pastor he is
[1:08:35] disqualified right here first
[1:08:37] sentence very very important that that
[1:08:40] man how can you counsel somebody if you
[1:08:43] with marriage and divorce or whatever it
[1:08:44] is you have to be able to open your
[1:08:46] Bible and say Here's what the Bible says
[1:08:48] you can't
[1:08:49] defer to another man if there's a
[1:08:53] problem in the church church that's why
[1:08:54] you're the
[1:09:01] pastor and contrary to popular
[1:09:03] perception a pastor's gift is not only
[1:09:06] in standing in front of the congregation
[1:09:08] and expounding other word this pastor
[1:09:10] must be able to rightly divide this
[1:09:13] so he can handle every situation in the
[1:09:17] church and especially
[1:09:19] conflict when we
[1:09:22] see when we see a central
[1:09:25] organization
[1:09:27] dictating how a service goes or what the
[1:09:32] Serv what should be set in the surface
[1:09:35] whether it's a tape or what whatever it
[1:09:37] is that is the very definition of a
[1:09:41] denomination we would never do
[1:09:44] that but we
[1:09:50] do and if you don't have a pastor
[1:09:52] friends you don't have a church
[1:09:54] that's just it's just by definition that
[1:09:56] word blameless I said that that I was
[1:09:59] going to come back to it and it and it
[1:10:00] says the same thing for a deacon it
[1:10:02] doesn't mean that you've never done
[1:10:03] anything wrong or that there's no past
[1:10:05] sins in your life every living breathing
[1:10:07] human human being has past sins but
[1:10:09] blameless means above reproach as I said
[1:10:13] the Deacon has the same
[1:10:15] qualification and a blameless means that
[1:10:18] this pastor or this Deacon is living a
[1:10:20] Godly life he's not cheating on his wife
[1:10:22] he's not breaking the law he's not
[1:10:24] embezzling money from the church he's a
[1:10:26] godly man living a Godly life he lives
[1:10:30] the message that he preaches not given
[1:10:33] to
[1:10:34] Wine he's not a drunk nor Striker he's
[1:10:38] not violent not greedy a filthy lucer
[1:10:41] but patient not a brawler not Covetous
[1:10:44] filthy lucer as you know is money and
[1:10:46] it's not just money it's dishonest money
[1:10:49] there should be no pyramid schemes in
[1:10:52] the church
[1:10:55] there should be
[1:10:57] no
[1:10:58] parties where the Deacon's wife or the
[1:11:02] pastor's wife milk the people for money
[1:11:05] with high pressure sales now I know it
[1:11:08] happens it started way back when
[1:11:11] remember brother Kim Wa with
[1:11:14] Tupperware
[1:11:16] and and then it went to like
[1:11:19] Amway and then it goes to essential oils
[1:11:22] and it goes to all these things that
[1:11:24] they have these these group get
[1:11:25] togethers and then it's pyramid schemes
[1:11:27] and all this I won't have it in this
[1:11:31] church I don't agree with that that's
[1:11:34] not making money in an honest way that's
[1:11:37] using your friends and then if everybody
[1:11:39] just kind of Trades
[1:11:41] money it doesn't work and especially
[1:11:45] with the pastor the deacons and the
[1:11:48] trustees absolutely
[1:11:52] not
[1:11:56] now as far as filthy lucer also brother
[1:11:59] Brandon made the statement one time that
[1:12:01] tithes go to the pastor but then he also
[1:12:05] said that he re receives a salary of
[1:12:08] $100 a week so I see so often the
[1:12:12] pastors and they go back to the box
[1:12:14] after every service and they're the ones
[1:12:16] that collect the money and they go in
[1:12:18] and the trustees never see it that's not
[1:12:21] what brother Brandon was saying when
[1:12:23] brother brandom said that the ties go to
[1:12:26] the pastors he he talked about soup
[1:12:28] suppers and having all of these
[1:12:30] different fundraisers so that you can
[1:12:32] pay the pastor the pastor enough money
[1:12:36] should come in to pay the pastor a
[1:12:38] salary but saying that all the money
[1:12:40] goes to the pastor that breaks the whole
[1:12:42] thing here then why did he have a
[1:12:47] salary one that ruleth well his own
[1:12:49] house having his children in subjection
[1:12:51] without gravity again this this also
[1:12:54] applies applies to a deacon ruling well
[1:12:56] his own house is that his children are
[1:12:59] in subjection to him and they respect
[1:13:01] their father in his walk with the Lord
[1:13:04] because the children grow up with the
[1:13:06] dad they see the dad's faults they see
[1:13:09] his weaknesses they see his strengths so
[1:13:12] as as they're growing up they may stray
[1:13:14] and they all
[1:13:15] do that doesn't disqualify the pastor
[1:13:18] what disqualifies the pastor is the kid
[1:13:21] saying my dad's a hypocrite and I I
[1:13:24] don't respect
[1:13:25] him there's a difference
[1:13:29] there for if a man know not how to rule
[1:13:32] his own house how shall he take care of
[1:13:35] the Church of God not a novice lest
[1:13:37] being lifted up with pride he fall into
[1:13:39] the condemnation of the devil that word
[1:13:41] novice means a new
[1:13:44] believer where he is a pastor or a
[1:13:46] deacon he needs to be tried first this
[1:13:50] can't
[1:13:51] be he can't just have just come into the
[1:13:55] the faith and just started believing and
[1:13:57] and he may be a great guy and he may be
[1:13:59] filled with the Holy Spirit and all that
[1:14:01] but there is a time of trial that we all
[1:14:04] go through not just a pastor not just a
[1:14:06] deacon or a trustee but all of us we go
[1:14:09] through that that
[1:14:11] trial where we prove our faith to the
[1:14:15] Lord and to each
[1:14:17] other I still think a young man in his
[1:14:20] 20s and 30s can be a pastor or a deacon
[1:14:23] but there still needs to be years of
[1:14:26] experience there behind him not months
[1:14:29] or
[1:14:30] weeks moreover he must have a good
[1:14:32] report of them which are without lest he
[1:14:35] fall into the reproach and the snare of
[1:14:36] the
[1:14:37] devil he must have the respect of the
[1:14:39] people outside the church if you have a
[1:14:41] bad reputation in business and at your
[1:14:44] work and all of that how are you
[1:14:47] qualified to be here as a deacon or a
[1:14:50] trustee or or a pastor that's your
[1:14:53] personality that's who you are and if
[1:14:55] you're outside and you're sinning those
[1:14:58] sins will be brought into this church
[1:15:01] let me read
[1:15:05] um the
[1:15:07] uh I'll read what I have for the uh
[1:15:10] statement for the pastor for the church
[1:15:12] bylaws and I want everybody to review
[1:15:14] this um because we're also going to
[1:15:16] ratify these bylaws this this Sunday it
[1:15:20] says here for the pastor the pastor
[1:15:22] provides spiritual leaders ERS ship and
[1:15:23] is the ultimate Authority in all major
[1:15:25] decisions of the church he sets the
[1:15:28] order of worship ministers or arranges
[1:15:30] for others to minister at Public
[1:15:31] Services provides counseling for members
[1:15:34] and their children ensures the church
[1:15:36] finances are collected and administered
[1:15:38] ethically and perform such other duties
[1:15:40] as are commonly associated with being a
[1:15:43] pastor Pastor must meet all
[1:15:45] qualifications set forth by the Apostle
[1:15:47] Paul in 1 Timothy 3 and Titus 1 among
[1:15:51] among other things he must be married
[1:15:53] not divorced a good father a loving
[1:15:55] husband a man of good reputation
[1:15:57] hospitable and must handle his own
[1:15:59] finances
[1:16:00] well I wrote those words and that those
[1:16:04] are going to be if voted on by the
[1:16:09] church and accepted by the church those
[1:16:11] are going to be in our bylaws now the
[1:16:16] Deacon says this deacons provide
[1:16:19] assistance to the pastor and are
[1:16:21] responsible for maintaining order in the
[1:16:22] church
[1:16:23] this includes but is not limited to such
[1:16:26] things as assisting in serving communion
[1:16:27] bringing various matters to the
[1:16:29] attention of the pastor they may handle
[1:16:32] requests for minor Financial or other
[1:16:35] assistance deacons do not make financial
[1:16:38] decisions concerning the building
[1:16:39] property of the church or church
[1:16:41] expenses such as salary salaries or
[1:16:44] offerings to the Min to ministers
[1:16:47] qualifications like the pastor and
[1:16:49] associate pastor a deacon must meet all
[1:16:51] the qualifications set for by the
[1:16:53] Apostle Paul in 1 Timothy
[1:16:56] 3 so let's get to the office of a
[1:17:04] deacon um verse number eight likewise
[1:17:08] must the deacons be grave not double
[1:17:10] tonged not given to much wine not greedy
[1:17:12] of filthy
[1:17:14] lucer as I said earlier grave is usually
[1:17:18] translated as worthy of
[1:17:21] respect holding the mystery of the faith
[1:17:24] in a pure
[1:17:27] conscience now if brother Brandon would
[1:17:30] have defined what that means I would
[1:17:32] read the read the quote here the
[1:17:34] Amplified Bible says this and and I I
[1:17:36] couldn't find anywhere where brother
[1:17:38] brandom Define that the Amplified Bible
[1:17:40] says this but upholding and fully
[1:17:42] understanding the mystery that is the
[1:17:45] true doctrine of the Christian faith
[1:17:48] with a clear conscience resulting from
[1:17:50] Behavior consistent with spiritual
[1:17:53] maturity in short the deacons must
[1:17:55] understand what the Christian faith is
[1:17:58] and live that before the people
[1:18:00] understand what they
[1:18:02] believe and let these also be first
[1:18:04] proved then let them use the office of a
[1:18:07] deacon being found
[1:18:09] blameless so a deacon needs to operate
[1:18:12] as an usher or a trustee or some other
[1:18:14] leadership position in the church before
[1:18:15] he is ordained as a deacon and a deacon
[1:18:19] is a spiritual role in the church so a
[1:18:23] deacon a trustee can too but a deacon
[1:18:26] especially can have a
[1:18:29] Ministry a
[1:18:31] deacon uh Stephen Phillip both of them
[1:18:35] went out and preached the gospel LED
[1:18:38] souls to Christ operated as evangelist
[1:18:40] Miracles followed those Brothers they
[1:18:42] were able to go out and have this
[1:18:45] ministry and still be a deacon in the
[1:18:48] church one thing a deacon does not say
[1:18:52] though it does not say a deacon is able
[1:18:56] to teach that's a myth so many US of us
[1:19:01] have heard that the Bible says a deacon
[1:19:03] is apt to teach or brother brandom said
[1:19:06] a deacon is apt to teach that's just not
[1:19:08] true it's not in the Bible and it's not
[1:19:11] in the
[1:19:13] message so it's not a
[1:19:16] requirement it is something that many
[1:19:18] deacons have that gift but it is not a
[1:19:22] requirement for as for the word as far
[1:19:24] as the word
[1:19:25] goes even so must their wives be grave
[1:19:30] not slanderers sober faithful in all
[1:19:32] things so this is very very important
[1:19:35] just as much as a God calls a deacon he
[1:19:37] also calls his wife into this ministry a
[1:19:40] Deacon's wife can't be partakers of the
[1:19:42] gossip of the church she should rise
[1:19:44] above that just as a deacon should she
[1:19:46] needs to be in service needs to be
[1:19:49] available to help she needs to always be
[1:19:51] willing to give a hand or even just a
[1:19:53] shoulder to cry on she should be a
[1:19:55] respected sister in the
[1:19:59] church God calls these sisters and he
[1:20:03] very plainly lines it out right here
[1:20:06] that that sister needs to be living a
[1:20:10] life that is worthy of what this 1
[1:20:13] Timothy chapter 3 says let the deacons
[1:20:15] be the husbands of one wife ruling their
[1:20:17] children in their own house as well I
[1:20:18] covered that with the pastor for they
[1:20:20] that have used the office of a deacon
[1:20:22] well purchased to themselves a good
[1:20:23] degree and great boldness in the faith
[1:20:26] which is in Jesus
[1:20:28] Christ when uh brother brandham was
[1:20:31] dedicating my aunt Carina my my
[1:20:34] grandfather was a deacon and he says
[1:20:37] this he says gracious heavenly father as
[1:20:39] we stand here before this Deacon tonight
[1:20:42] speaking of my speaking of my
[1:20:43] grandfather dedicating in front his
[1:20:46] child in front of the audience and truly
[1:20:49] a fine office he holds for a deacon must
[1:20:52] be found blameless the husband of one
[1:20:54] wife controlling his family well for if
[1:20:56] he doesn't know how to control his
[1:20:58] family how can he control the house of
[1:21:00] God and we thank thee that this brother
[1:21:02] has met these qualifications and find in
[1:21:05] him the spirit of God now I've talked
[1:21:06] with my grandpa many times I've talked
[1:21:08] with my grand really all the deacons at
[1:21:10] the Tabernacle from way back when um
[1:21:12] brother wheeler brother Hickerson was a
[1:21:14] very very close friend he was like
[1:21:16] family so we talked a lot about what
[1:21:19] brother brandham was like and how and
[1:21:21] the roles of the Deacons
[1:21:24] brother brandham was not a dominating
[1:21:26] man who made every decision for the
[1:21:28] church the brothers did their best to
[1:21:31] operate according to the scriptures
[1:21:33] under the leadership of brother Brandon
[1:21:35] and brother Neville and they would ask
[1:21:38] if they had a question but if someone
[1:21:41] was causing a disturbance in the church
[1:21:44] they didn't ask brother brandom they
[1:21:45] took the care of the situation that was
[1:21:47] their job not the pastor's job that's
[1:21:50] the Deacon's job to be able to use the
[1:21:52] wisdom to take care of any typ type of
[1:21:54] disturbance or any type of problem
[1:21:56] that's in the church and the same thing
[1:21:59] with the sisters that are the wives
[1:22:02] those sisters should ask their husband
[1:22:05] the
[1:22:06] Deacon not ask me but ask her husband
[1:22:10] and then take care of whatever situation
[1:22:11] it may be and then the deacons answer to
[1:22:14] me and if if you've done wrong then then
[1:22:16] we'll discuss
[1:22:21] that
[1:22:25] in all this
[1:22:26] work it says
[1:22:29] here I want to read that
[1:22:33] again verse number 13 it says for they
[1:22:35] have used the office of a deacon well
[1:22:37] purchased to themselves a good degree
[1:22:39] and great boldness in the faith which is
[1:22:42] in Christ
[1:22:43] Jesus so in all this work that these
[1:22:46] deacons perform you purchase for
[1:22:49] yourself a good degree and great
[1:22:51] boldness in the faith that is in Christ
[1:22:54] Jesus so having that being elected to
[1:22:57] that position have faith in your
[1:23:01] prayers and the congregation should have
[1:23:03] faith in these deacons prayers these
[1:23:06] brothers are living a life they are
[1:23:08] purchasing this this great honor that
[1:23:11] they have with all of their efforts and
[1:23:13] always being in church and going and
[1:23:15] visiting the sick and doing all these
[1:23:16] things and then God will honor what they
[1:23:19] have
[1:23:20] done and bless all of
[1:23:25] us these things write I unto thee hoping
[1:23:29] to come unto thee shortly but if I T
[1:23:31] long that thou mayest know how how thou
[1:23:33] oughtest to behave thyself in the house
[1:23:36] of God which is the Church of the Living
[1:23:38] God the pillar and ground of Truth and
[1:23:41] without controversy great is the mystery
[1:23:42] of godliness God was manifested in the
[1:23:45] flesh justified in the spirit seen of
[1:23:48] angels preached unto the Gentiles
[1:23:50] believed on in the world and received up
[1:23:52] in into Glory Paul always ends up with
[1:23:55] the Lord Jesus whatever Direction he
[1:23:58] goes whatever he's teaching it always
[1:24:00] comes back to the Lord and I'll cover
[1:24:02] the trustees quickly
[1:24:04] here um the
[1:24:07] trustees and the
[1:24:11] bylaws the trustees oversee the real
[1:24:13] property of the church and advise the
[1:24:14] pastor and congregation regarding the
[1:24:16] church property as well as the overall
[1:24:18] Financial condition of the church
[1:24:20] trustees May sign deeds and other legal
[1:24:22] documents necessary for the functioning
[1:24:24] of the church managing its properties
[1:24:26] and similar tasks on behalf of the
[1:24:28] church major financial decisions require
[1:24:31] a formal vote of the trustees with a
[1:24:34] majority required in every member of the
[1:24:36] trustee board casting a vote the P the
[1:24:39] pastor casts the deciding vote in the
[1:24:41] case of a tie and the pastor has veto
[1:24:44] authority over any decision that does
[1:24:45] not receive unanimous vote from the
[1:24:48] Board of Trustees with three or more
[1:24:50] trustees on the board
[1:24:53] trustees may or may not have signature
[1:24:55] Authority and a trustee must be a voting
[1:24:58] member of the Tucson Tabernacle
[1:25:00] responsibly manage his personal finances
[1:25:02] be of good moral character and conduct
[1:25:04] his life in a way that reflects the
[1:25:07] nature of Jesus Christ he is not subject
[1:25:10] to the qualifications of deacons and
[1:25:12] Pastors in 1 Timothy 3 brother um
[1:25:15] brandham had a number of
[1:25:17] Trustees one of those was brother
[1:25:19] Roberson brother Roberson was divorced
[1:25:22] and
[1:25:24] remarried he was not qualified to be a
[1:25:27] deacon but brother brandham still had
[1:25:29] him on his trustey
[1:25:39] board now I think we've
[1:25:42] covered everything as far as the vote
[1:25:46] this weekend and for the visitors it's
[1:25:48] not a normal service I was trying to
[1:25:51] Define these because I want to make sure
[1:25:53] that we're all in one Accord I I want
[1:25:56] that I want to I want the lord to bless
[1:25:58] us I want him to be in everything that
[1:26:02] we do and I want to do things right and
[1:26:03] lay a good foundation as I said earlier
[1:26:06] um on my WhatsApp broadcast that I will
[1:26:08] send out a copy of these bylaws to
[1:26:13] everyone we will vote yes or no on the
[1:26:17] bylaws read them check
[1:26:20] them and pray about them contact me if
[1:26:24] you have a a problem with them as I said
[1:26:27] last Sunday
[1:26:29] night I've asked nominated before the
[1:26:33] church brother Aaron Gara who's been a
[1:26:36] man that has been faithful always
[1:26:39] serving the church and is I think is
[1:26:42] well proven one thing about a deacon
[1:26:44] that Deacon has to be here almost every
[1:26:46] service of course they can go on
[1:26:48] vacation but they need to be faithful
[1:26:51] here always
[1:26:52] brother
[1:26:53] Aaron Brother um Lyall Johnson again a
[1:26:57] longtime member of the church here well
[1:27:00] proven um a man of of impeccable
[1:27:04] Integrity as I think all the brothers
[1:27:06] are then brother Jordan Peterson also
[1:27:09] brother Jordan is acting now as a
[1:27:11] trustee in the church um I think that
[1:27:14] brother Jordan of course he he's a great
[1:27:16] trustee but I think that um with brother
[1:27:20] Jordan's personality uh uh I really
[1:27:23] think that he could serve the church
[1:27:25] better as a deacon the deacons have to
[1:27:27] be able to and I think brother Jordan
[1:27:29] and all the brothers can the deacons
[1:27:30] have to be able
[1:27:32] to
[1:27:34] to um uphold the law they need to be
[1:27:38] able to go to someone and and tell them
[1:27:40] they're wrong or go to the children and
[1:27:42] and tell them not to run around in the
[1:27:44] in the in the sanctuary when we've let
[1:27:46] out or or whatever that may be and
[1:27:49] that's not that's not easy for most
[1:27:50] people to do but these these brothers I
[1:27:52] believe can do it and I think that
[1:27:54] they're going to make very very good
[1:27:56] deacons um as far as the trustees
[1:27:59] brother Arie Peterson back there who is
[1:28:03] um always here the brother is the most
[1:28:07] faithful Brother anytime there's a
[1:28:09] problem with anything I call Brother
[1:28:11] Arie and he's he's up here and taking
[1:28:14] care of fixing whatever he's he's a very
[1:28:17] very loyal and and very righteous man
[1:28:21] and then the same with brother Ed dugall
[1:28:23] I was just here with him last night we
[1:28:25] were here for a couple hours just going
[1:28:26] over things with the church and the
[1:28:28] church building so two Trustees for now
[1:28:31] three deacons and that also leaves many
[1:28:34] a few positions open and I would like to
[1:28:36] fill those positions also in the in the
[1:28:39] future I know it's not normal um service
[1:28:43] but are there any questions that anyone
[1:28:45] has I'll do my best to
[1:28:51] answer
[1:28:55] okay
[1:28:57] no what we'll do is after praying about
[1:29:01] this I think the best thing to do is a
[1:29:03] two-year term for each position brother
[1:29:07] Brandon was plain in and I I skipped
[1:29:10] that part of that quote brother Brandon
[1:29:11] was plain in saying that the pastor is
[1:29:15] not voted on he said no not the pastor
[1:29:17] but the trustees and the deacons he's
[1:29:19] Pastor until but I feel and we are a
[1:29:22] sovereign church we are not the brandom
[1:29:23] Tabernacle I feel to be voted on during
[1:29:26] the elections and there will be twoyear
[1:29:29] terms elections and then you as brother
[1:29:33] brandom said in that quote then the
[1:29:37] officers in the church will decide do I
[1:29:39] want to continue on or do I want to
[1:29:41] resign my position and have someone else
[1:29:44] go before the church for a vote and then
[1:29:47] they'll they'll be voted on every two
[1:29:49] years any other questions
[1:29:55] I'll close with this quote and the
[1:29:56] musicians can
[1:29:59] come again I want to read that one that
[1:30:02] I that I said
[1:30:04] earlier you are elected trustees and
[1:30:07] your name is on the books and now
[1:30:09] they're going to have some more
[1:30:10] elections of deacons and so forth and
[1:30:12] brother Neville is will be calling those
[1:30:14] immediately after service all right and
[1:30:17] for the treasur and so forth as we can
[1:30:19] set the church up get it all all
[1:30:22] backgrounds ready and then we can have a
[1:30:26] Revival as it comes
[1:30:28] on you may not think that the world may
[1:30:31] not think that these things are
[1:30:32] important but God requires things we
[1:30:36] want to have every duck in a row we want
[1:30:40] to have every piece placed in the puzzle
[1:30:44] and then God will pour out his Spirit do
[1:30:46] you remember I talk about it fairly
[1:30:50] often how when Solomon's Temple was
[1:30:53] built everything was
[1:30:56] finished everything was according to
[1:30:59] God's plan and David had given them
[1:31:01] Blueprints and everything here's how you
[1:31:02] do it everything was lined out it was
[1:31:06] finished and then God came down and
[1:31:10] entered into the
[1:31:13] temple and friends that's why I want to
[1:31:15] be I want to make sure that we are
[1:31:17] correct in everything that we do let's
[1:31:19] all stand I'll read one more quote
[1:31:24] here brother Bram says
[1:31:27] this now I think it's our duty to make
[1:31:30] the inside
[1:31:32] right by the grace of God to be so
[1:31:35] grateful to
[1:31:37] God that our that this will just not
[1:31:41] only be a beautiful building that will
[1:31:44] come to but may everyone who comes in
[1:31:47] see the beautiful characteristics of
[1:31:50] Jesus Christ in every person that comes
[1:31:54] in may it be a consecrated place to our
[1:31:58] Lord a consecrated people for no matter
[1:32:01] how beautiful the structure is that we
[1:32:04] certainly do appreciate the beauty of
[1:32:07] the church is the character of the
[1:32:11] people I trust it'll always be a house
[1:32:14] of God of
[1:32:17] beauty brother Paul and I brother Paul
[1:32:19] Murray back there and I have been
[1:32:23] talking and
[1:32:25] how the true temple of God the True
[1:32:28] Church of God is not this building it's
[1:32:32] not it's not just the place to worship
[1:32:35] the true temple of God is the
[1:32:39] individual that makes himself or herself
[1:32:43] ready that does
[1:32:45] everything that they
[1:32:47] can honors God does all the all the
[1:32:53] Commandments and then says Lord here I
[1:32:56] am and then that Holy Spirit comes into
[1:32:58] that
[1:33:00] individual that is the true temple of
[1:33:02] God and this church I want to be made up
[1:33:07] of hundreds of those temples bringing
[1:33:11] their fire into this congregation
[1:33:15] worshiping worshiping in spirit and in
[1:33:17] truth as I said earlier there's a motion
[1:33:21] there
[1:33:22] there there's the word there there's the
[1:33:26] Holy Spirit there and everything
[1:33:29] operating according to God's perfect
[1:33:32] will we may be shouting or we may be
[1:33:35] sitting in our Pew
[1:33:36] crying but it's the same holy spirit
[1:33:39] that should be operating in each person
[1:33:42] God bless you all brother
[1:33:47] [Music]

[1:36:20] Lord
[1:36:22] God bless you this evening it's
[1:36:24] wonderful to be here with you again we
[1:36:25] were here last year at the time you have
[1:36:28] Harmony we're a little disappointed that
[1:36:29] Harmony didn't happen but we but we
[1:36:32] understand we understand these these
[1:36:35] things you know I have to tell you that
[1:36:37] I've been a a student of church order
[1:36:41] for a very long time I've been involved
[1:36:42] in writing bylaws and and I actually
[1:36:46] wrote a book about it once and and uh I
[1:36:49] have to tell you that was an excellent
[1:36:52] job this evening it was just so nicely
[1:36:54] laid out from the message and you know
[1:36:57] as we progress through life like I can
[1:36:59] look on my experience and I've held
[1:37:01] almost every office in the church other
[1:37:03] than Pastor or Deacon and uh so I have a
[1:37:06] lot of experience with it but as we grow
[1:37:09] through life we realize as you know you
[1:37:11] know those of you who have gray hair
[1:37:13] have you come to realize how little we
[1:37:15] know yes you know the younger ones know
[1:37:18] a
[1:37:19] lot but the old older we get the more
[1:37:22] and more we realize we don't really know
[1:37:24] anything yes amen that's the truth and
[1:37:26] so we're so so thankful to have the
[1:37:29] message of the hour that we can take it
[1:37:32] we can open it up and the instructions
[1:37:34] are plain I liked when when he said you
[1:37:35] know brother brandom has clearly
[1:37:37] explained how it's supposed to be and
[1:37:39] how all these things are supposed to be
[1:37:41] the challenge is getting us to our
[1:37:42] spirit to agree with that right of
[1:37:45] course that's the that's the purpose of
[1:37:46] the holy spirit so like I say really
[1:37:50] nice to be with you you here today and
[1:37:53] uh I I really enjoyed it I knew what you
[1:37:54] were doing tonight cuz I read it on your
[1:37:56] website and I actually wanted I was I
[1:37:58] you know there's a lot of churches here
[1:38:00] and we know people at different places
[1:38:02] and uh based on what was on your website
[1:38:05] is why I came here
[1:38:07] tonight because you know he basically
[1:38:09] said he was putting this and you know
[1:38:11] you we have to look back in the
[1:38:12] scripture you know we can go back to
[1:38:14] Elijah and you probably talked about it
[1:38:16] but Elijah when he was rolling the
[1:38:17] stones together and all those other guys
[1:38:19] were trying to have a Revival they were
[1:38:21] trying to get the presence of God to
[1:38:22] fall and they were cutting themselves
[1:38:24] and having this great emotional
[1:38:25] experience and here's Elijah just
[1:38:28] quietly Rolling Stones amen putting
[1:38:32] things in order put it's a restoration
[1:38:34] Ministry that we're under yes and so
[1:38:37] restoring and putting things in order
[1:38:39] you know I traveled around the world
[1:38:40] with brother Harold hilderbrand some of
[1:38:42] you know who he is sure one of the
[1:38:44] greatest Apostles in the message that I
[1:38:46] know for a Setter in order of churches
[1:38:50] and when we look behind behind him so
[1:38:51] many successful churches all over the
[1:38:53] world you know he was doing this he'd go
[1:38:56] into a place where people were Loosely
[1:38:58] gathered around the message and he would
[1:39:00] put the church in order and put the
[1:39:02] pastor in his place and and the deacons
[1:39:04] and put all that in place so and and I
[1:39:08] look today and those churches that
[1:39:10] brother Harold founded 40 years ago and
[1:39:12] 30 years ago are still all strong
[1:39:16] growing churches upon which God poured
[1:39:19] upon which God for a great Revival in
[1:39:22] these last few years of over a 100,000
[1:39:26] people baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:39:28] Jesus in the last five or six years in
[1:39:30] the country of Uganda on the backs of
[1:39:32] those Church those churches that were
[1:39:35] founded and and and established on the
[1:39:38] word of God it's so important to put
[1:39:40] that in place and it it Thrills me when
[1:39:43] I see what when I see it being placed
[1:39:46] like that because I know what the
[1:39:48] trajectory is amen amen you know often
[1:39:51] times when a new church starts you
[1:39:52] wonder well I wonder where that's going
[1:39:55] wonder how that's going to turn out you
[1:39:57] know but when you see the foundation is
[1:40:00] on the message of the hour we're seeing
[1:40:03] the restoration being put the things
[1:40:06] being put in order and then when after
[1:40:09] Elijah was all done and all the stones
[1:40:11] in place here the are everything's in
[1:40:14] place then he said Let the Fire Fall
[1:40:17] amen and it did and it did
[1:40:22] so that's what we expect that's what we
[1:40:24] expect for this church when we
[1:40:26] see a pastor with a vision to put the
[1:40:29] church in order and to set it up you
[1:40:31] know it seems it it it can almost seem
[1:40:33] carnal and mundane
[1:40:36] and he seemed a little carnal all you do
[1:40:38] these guys were having Revival they're
[1:40:40] jumping out and they're shouting and
[1:40:41] they're prophesying they're having a
[1:40:43] great time and here's Elijah you should
[1:40:45] put stones in place rebuild the altar
[1:40:48] well that's not very
[1:40:49] exciting but when he got it in place the
[1:40:52] fire fell yes did amen let's pray
[1:40:56] together again it's wonderful to be with
[1:40:58] you here
[1:41:00] tonight father we bow before you tonight
[1:41:03] Lord so thankful for the grace that
[1:41:05] you've shown in each of our lives and
[1:41:07] that one common thing that brings us
[1:41:09] together Lord your Holy Spirit and your
[1:41:12] forgiveness
[1:41:13] Lord Lord you told a story once of two
[1:41:16] men going up to the temple and one said

[1:41:20] denominations I'm glad I'm not like this
[1:41:22] person or that person and one smed his
[1:41:24] breast and said oh God forgive me a
[1:41:27] sinner Lord amen and father that's where
[1:41:29] we are tonight Lord forgive us father
