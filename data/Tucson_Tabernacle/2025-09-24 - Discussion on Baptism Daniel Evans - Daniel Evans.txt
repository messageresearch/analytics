[0:00] Amen. Praise God. Let's bow our heads.
[0:10] Heavenly Father, we thank you once again
[0:13] that you were kind enough
[0:17] to us to bring us together
[0:20] that we might open the scriptures and
[0:23] Father to learn more about your word and
[0:27] more about you.
[0:29] Father, as we learn on this very, very
[0:31] important subject of baptism tonight, I
[0:33] pray that that you'd be pleased with all
[0:36] that's said and also, Father, that if
[0:38] there would be a question upon the
[0:40] hearts of anyone here or anyone
[0:42] listening in, Lord, that you would
[0:45] answer that question.
[0:48] Father,
[0:50] we pray, Lord, for wisdom.
[0:53] James, I believe it was, that said, if a
[0:55] man lacks wisdom, let him pray,
[0:58] God, that he would receive it. Father,
[1:00] we pray that you would give us wisdom
[1:04] in your scriptures, Lord. In Jesus name
[1:06] we pray. Amen. Amen. You can be seated.
[1:10] God bless you all.
[1:16] I
[1:19] wanted to
[1:21] go into the subject of baptism. We've
[1:24] had quite a few there there's always a
[1:28] question before someone is baptized.
[1:31] Should I be baptized? Should I not be
[1:33] baptized? And one of the questions that
[1:35] we received when I asked when I ask the
[1:37] congregation, if there's anything on
[1:39] your heart, write it down and then I'll
[1:42] try to get to some of these questions. I
[1:43] think two people wrote in that they
[1:46] would like to have a a sermon just
[1:48] dedicated or a lesson just dedicated on
[1:51] the subject of baptism. And I figured
[1:55] we'll continue on on these Wednesday
[1:57] nights and answering these questions and
[1:59] continue to write these questions in if
[2:01] you have any more. And I I think it's a
[2:04] very very important subject. It's
[2:06] baptism is something that really defines
[2:09] a Christian
[2:11] and it's something that I think we have
[2:14] to be careful about making this concept
[2:18] of baptism too complicated.
[2:22] It's actually it's it's a very very
[2:24] simple thing.
[2:26] And the the com another common question
[2:30] that people ask is, well, I didn't
[2:32] really understand baptism when I got
[2:35] baptized. Should I be rebaptized?
[2:38] And I I think it's a question in many
[2:40] people's minds. And and it's it's
[2:44] something that
[2:46] it's not necessarily scriptural
[2:49] to be rebaptized. It seems like baptism
[2:52] is pretty much the first thing that
[2:53] comes. It's the first thing that comes
[2:55] in the Bible is is you see that people
[2:57] give their hearts to the Lord. They and
[2:59] they want to be baptized and then many
[3:02] times immediately the Holy Ghost comes
[3:05] down on them. But I think if there's a
[3:07] question
[3:09] in your heart then of course it's better
[3:13] to not leave anything undone, not have
[3:15] any question in in your minds. But if
[3:19] you have truly given your heart to the
[3:23] Lord Jesus, if you have truly made that
[3:26] commitment to him and you were baptized
[3:29] correctly, I don't necessarily see a
[3:32] reason for you to be rebaptized. But
[3:34] again, if you feel that you want to be
[3:36] rebaptized, there's nothing wrong with
[3:38] it. I can't tell you any scriptures or
[3:40] anything that says that you shouldn't.
[3:44] Uh but a lot of times we do we make it
[3:46] too complicated and it's really it's a
[3:50] very simple concept this concept of
[3:52] baptism.
[3:54] Baptism is symbolic
[3:58] and you have to understand that it is
[4:01] symbolic before you can really
[4:04] understand baptism. It symbolizes death
[4:08] when you go down into the water but it
[4:10] is not death. It symbolizes a new birth,
[4:15] but it's not a new birth. It symbolizes
[4:18] your sins being washed away, but your
[4:21] sins are not washed away when you are
[4:23] baptized. And until we understand that
[4:27] symbolism in baptism, I don't think that
[4:29] we can fully understand what it is. It's
[4:33] um
[4:35] as I said, it's a simple concept and
[4:37] many times we make it too complicated.
[4:40] Baptism comes from the Greek word
[4:44] baptiso.
[4:46] And baptiso it means to be immersed in
[4:50] water. It um the definition says this to
[4:54] immerse
[4:55] to submerge to make fully wet. Pretty
[5:00] pretty simple concept. And it was used
[5:03] in reference many times to a sunken ship
[5:08] or a lot of times it was used it is used
[5:10] to describe washing clothes. You need to
[5:13] fully uh submerge your clothes in water
[5:16] to get them clean. So it just means to
[5:19] go underwater. And the Catholic Church
[5:22] has really just dumbed down this
[5:27] definition of baptism. It's and I
[5:31] understand it was probably for
[5:33] convenience sake that they did this, but
[5:36] they changed the practice of baptism
[5:40] into
[5:42] sprinkling or pouring water on on
[5:45] someone. It really it just butchers the
[5:47] whole concept of of of being baptized.
[5:49] The original
[5:51] with the Catholic application, the
[5:54] original meaning that the apostles had,
[5:56] it just doesn't make sense. The very
[5:59] word doesn't make sense in the Catholic
[6:01] application. And it just you don't
[6:05] sprinkle a ship to the bottom of the
[6:09] ocean.
[6:10] You know what I mean? You don't sprinkle
[6:13] your laundry when you're trying to get
[6:15] it clean. You have to really put it
[6:18] underneath the water. And it's symbolic,
[6:22] but this symbolism in baptism, it loses
[6:26] its meaning with sprinkling.
[6:30] And you don't want just a sprinkling of
[6:34] the remission of your sins.
[6:37] No, one sin will send you to hell.
[6:41] &gt;&gt; So, you want a complete baptism
[6:44] and a complete remission of sins. I
[6:47] remember I baptized a a sister
[6:51] and here and you want to go all the way
[6:55] underwater. And I understand that the
[6:58] the the Lord knows and we do our best to
[7:01] do things right. We we do our best to do
[7:03] things according to the Bible. But I was
[7:04] baptizing this sister and she got really
[7:07] tense
[7:09] and I I put her under the water and I
[7:12] got right about to right here
[7:15] and
[7:17] she
[7:18] wasn't having it.
[7:21] And I, you know how you think, you can
[7:23] think really fast in just a moment. And
[7:27] all these things were going through my
[7:28] mind and and I was like, it was probably
[7:31] a fraction of a second. And I and I put
[7:33] her down there and I was just like, I'm
[7:37] gonna do it. And I just I put her on the
[7:40] way up and then I brought her up and I'm
[7:44] glad I did because that that was the
[7:46] right way to do it. And I brought her up
[7:48] and she was okay. She didn't drown. She
[7:49] was only, you know, underwater for a fra
[7:53] just a little bit. But she got all the
[7:55] way underwater. And if I would have
[7:58] brought her up without putting her
[7:59] under, I I don't think that I would have
[8:01] broken the word of God. We were trying
[8:03] to do it. And I understand that there
[8:05] are probably situations when you really
[8:08] can't put someone all all the way
[8:10] underwater. But if we have the
[8:12] opportunity,
[8:14] we should make every effort to do things
[8:18] according to what the word says,
[8:19] towarding toward what the Bible says.
[8:22] The the Catholic Church, they say that
[8:25] they have the authority
[8:28] to interpret scripture in different ways
[8:30] or they have the authority to change it
[8:32] because the authority they say is in the
[8:33] apostles and not necessarily in the
[8:35] written word. I wholeheartedly disagree.
[8:38] the the authority is in the written word
[8:41] and not in the church. The church has to
[8:45] follow the leading of of the word and do
[8:48] their best to do what the word says. And
[8:52] it's it's when Jesus told the disciples
[8:57] that that when he when he came and he
[8:59] was washing their feet and Peter said,
[9:01] "Ah, you can't wash my feet." And Jesus
[9:04] said, 'Listen, if I don't wash your
[9:06] feet, then you have no part with me. And
[9:09] watch how Peter responds. He said,
[9:11] 'Lord, not only my feet, but my hands
[9:15] and my head. Peter wanted to be
[9:18] completely
[9:19] immersed in this Jesus Christ. So, we
[9:24] want to do things according to the word
[9:26] to the best of our abilities.
[9:29] It's it's vitally important that we do
[9:32] them right. And this baptism we have to
[9:37] understand. It's symbolic. Yes. But it
[9:41] is also necessary and it is also very
[9:45] very important. We really I wanted to
[9:49] start with our baptism. I wanted to
[9:52] start in the Old Testament. Now, we
[9:55] don't necessarily have any record of
[9:57] baptisms in the Old Testament. There are
[10:00] references to ceremonial washing and and
[10:04] the mikvah that they would make this
[10:07] ceremonial area that held water that
[10:10] that they could if they had touched an
[10:12] unclean animal or um certain times that
[10:15] they would go in and they would
[10:17] ceremonially
[10:18] wash. And I believe that that was a
[10:20] foundation and a precursor to baptism.
[10:24] But one thing that we see, the New
[10:27] Testament writers, and I will get to
[10:30] this, the New Testament writers, they
[10:33] often refer back to things that happened
[10:37] in the Old Testament. And they want us
[10:41] to apply baptism to these things that
[10:45] had happened in the Old Testament. They
[10:48] want a correlation to be there between
[10:52] baptism and things that happened in the
[10:55] Old Testament. And this one
[11:00] there there's usually a two-fold meaning
[11:03] of baptism in the Old Testament. There's
[11:05] usually judgment and salvation in in
[11:08] both of these. But let's look at the way
[11:11] that the Bible starts in Genesis 1 verse
[11:16] one. Watch what's associated with water
[11:20] here. And baptism obviously has water
[11:24] involved. Genesis 1:1. In the beginning,
[11:26] God created the heaven and the earth.
[11:30] And the earth was without form and void,
[11:33] and darkness was upon the face of the
[11:36] deep. Now watch this. And the spirit of
[11:39] God, the Holy Spirit, the spirit of God
[11:44] moved upon the face of the waters. So we
[11:49] see right here, we see the Holy Spirit
[11:51] and water tied together in the second
[11:55] verse of the entire Bible. And often
[11:59] the we're going to see a lot of
[12:01] correlations in the Old Testament. And
[12:04] the two that I want to talk about are
[12:06] one of them is Noah and the other one is
[12:10] Moses where that this two-fold
[12:13] representation of baptism that we see
[12:16] the water came the water destroys and
[12:19] then the water saves. So we see Noah
[12:23] when Noah was here. He he built this
[12:26] ship
[12:27] and the earth flooded
[12:32] and judgment came upon the earth and it
[12:35] destroyed evil that was in the earth and
[12:39] then that same water saved Noah. Think
[12:43] about baptism. Let's go to first Peter
[12:45] chapter 3 verse 18. Remember, first
[12:48] Peter is in the New Testament and it's
[12:50] referring back to what happened with
[12:52] Noah and it says this. I'll read the New
[12:55] King James version. We'll have the Old
[12:56] King James up there. I like doing that
[12:58] sometimes because if we're reading the
[13:01] Old King James, you might not be able to
[13:02] understand some of the things, some of
[13:04] the words that are in there. So, if you
[13:06] have me reading the New King James and
[13:08] you can kind of apply them together. So,
[13:10] I'll read the New King James. We'll put
[13:11] the Old King James up there. 1 Peter
[13:13] chapter 3 verse 18. It says this, "For
[13:17] Christ Christ also suffered once for
[13:19] sins, the just for the unjust, that he
[13:23] might bring us to God, being put to
[13:27] death in the flesh, but made alive by
[13:30] the spirit." Believe the King James says
[13:32] quickened. Quickened and and made alive
[13:35] are the are the same mean the same
[13:37] thing.
[13:39] And made alive by the spirit. by whom
[13:41] also he went and preached to the spirits
[13:44] in prison, who formerly were
[13:46] disobedient, when once the divine
[13:49] longsuffering
[13:51] waited in the days of Noah while the ark
[13:56] was being prepared in which a few that
[13:59] is eight souls were saved through water.
[14:05] There is also an anti-ype
[14:10] which now saves us. baptism,
[14:14] not the removal of the filth of the
[14:16] flesh, but the answer of a good
[14:19] conscience towards God through the
[14:22] resurrection of Jesus Christ, who has
[14:24] gone into heaven and is at the right
[14:27] hand of God, angels and authorities and
[14:30] powers having been made subject to him.
[14:34] So here the author here, Peter, is
[14:37] saying, look at the Old Testament. Look
[14:40] at Noah. Look at what happened. This is
[14:43] like baptism. This is what happened.
[14:46] Baptism or the the earth was baptized
[14:49] with water. All of the bad was destroyed
[14:53] and then the good just rose to the top.
[14:55] And Noah the uh verse number 21. Let me
[14:58] point that out. And this is very
[15:00] important. And this is really the most
[15:03] important concept in all of baptism.
[15:05] I'll read the New Living Translation.
[15:07] Yeah, put put it up there.
[15:09] And
[15:13] and the water is a picture. Yeah, there
[15:16] we go. Yeah, like figure. The New Living
[15:19] Translation says, "And and that water is
[15:21] a picture of baptism, which now saves
[15:24] you not by removing dirt from your body,
[15:27] but as a response to God from a clean
[15:31] conscience. It is effective because of
[15:34] the resurrection of Jesus Christ." So,
[15:37] we see it's symbolic.
[15:39] And it is a response
[15:42] to God calling.
[15:45] It's a response. God is calling us and
[15:48] then we respond by taking the waters of
[15:51] baptism. And it's effective because
[15:54] Christ rose from the dead. This baptism.
[15:58] So when you think about baptism and this
[16:00] is going to be a recurring thing that it
[16:03] is always about Jesus Christ. Baptism is
[16:08] Now Moses Moses brought the people out
[16:11] of Egypt.
[16:13] They came to the Red Sea. The waters
[16:16] parted. They went through the Red Sea
[16:20] and then the Egyptians followed them.
[16:22] You know the story. The water came in
[16:24] and it destroyed their enemy and it
[16:28] saved
[16:29] the Hebrews.
[16:32] If we go to 1 Corinthians chapter 10,
[16:35] listen to this. I'll read the New King
[16:36] James Version again. Vers,
[16:40] I'll read I'll read the Old King James
[16:42] version. Moreover, brethren, I would not
[16:45] that you should be ignorant how that all
[16:47] our fathers were under the cloud and
[16:50] passed through the Red Sea.
[16:53] All were baptized unto Moses in the
[16:58] cloud and in the sea. And we're going to
[17:00] come back to that in a minute. All were
[17:03] baptized into Moses
[17:07] and the cloud in the sea. All ate.
[17:11] All did eat that same spiritual meat,
[17:14] that same food
[17:18] and drank the same spiritual drink.
[17:22] For they drank of that that spiritual
[17:24] rock that followed them. And that rock
[17:28] was Christ.
[17:31] But with most of them and but with many
[17:33] of them God was not well pleased for
[17:36] they were overthrown in the wilderness.
[17:39] So again verse number two and they were
[17:41] all baptized into Moses and that same
[17:45] rock that Moses smoked and water came
[17:47] out that brought life that same rock was
[17:51] Christ. So here again the apostle Paul
[17:54] is bringing us back to the Old Testament
[17:57] and he is saying that look think about
[18:01] this baptism and it's already been
[18:04] happening symbolically in the Old
[18:06] Testament. So Paul's describing the Red
[18:08] Sea as baptism and he wants to make that
[18:10] connection between the Red Sea and our
[18:13] own going into the water. The enemy was
[18:16] destroyed in the sea and God's people
[18:19] were saved and going through it.
[18:21] Again,
[18:23] we come back to this that it's all about
[18:27] Christ and we'll come back to that
[18:28] scripture in in a minute on a slightly
[18:31] different subject. So, we have baptism,
[18:33] we have feet washing, we have communion,
[18:36] and we have salvation in the Levitical
[18:40] laws and even the Godhead and all of
[18:42] these things that are in the Old
[18:43] Testament. They're all about this Jesus
[18:45] Christ and they all point to him. So
[18:47] when you are baptized, you are publicly
[18:51] taking the name of Jesus and you are
[18:53] becoming a Christian. You are not
[18:55] baptized into a congregation. You are
[18:58] not baptized into a church. You are not
[19:01] into a church building. You are baptized
[19:03] into a body of Christ. And Christ is the
[19:08] one who cleanses your sins. And we're
[19:10] really going to clench that down as we
[19:12] go through this. And it's not,
[19:16] as I said, it's symbolic. Don't get too
[19:19] literal in these things. So, we have
[19:23] variations in baptisms in the world
[19:26] today. And we have baptism in the name
[19:29] of the the father and son and the holy
[19:30] ghost. We have baptisms in the name of
[19:32] Jesus Christ. And let me tell you, this
[19:36] might surprise you. The way that this
[19:38] church has always baptized
[19:41] and the way that I have continued
[19:44] baptizing
[19:45] has no precedence in the Bible.
[19:48] You know what I'm talking about.
[19:52] There is no one in the Bible who was
[19:54] ever that we have record of who was ever
[19:57] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[20:00] Christ.
[20:02] Ah, you're surprised.
[20:04] It's fact.
[20:06] They were baptized in the name of the
[20:08] Lord Jesus. They were baptized in the
[20:11] name of Jesus Christ. But never has
[20:14] baptism been associated with that Lord
[20:17] Jesus Christ. I think it is correct and
[20:20] I'm going to show you why or I wouldn't
[20:21] do it. I believe it is correct. I
[20:24] believe God
[20:26] is many times represented in threes. And
[20:30] when we baptize,
[20:32] Lord
[20:34] is not a name.
[20:37] Christ is not a name.
[20:40] Jesus is the name. So when we say Lord
[20:45] Jesus Christ, we are we are talking
[20:48] about this man Jesus. So if someone
[20:51] asked me and they said, would you
[20:53] baptize me instead of the name of the
[20:56] Lord Jesus Christ, would you baptize me
[20:58] in the name of Jesus Christ? I'd say,
[20:59] "Sure, it's in the Bible." If someone
[21:01] asked me, "Would you baptize me in the
[21:03] name of the Lord Jesus?" I'd say, "Sure,
[21:05] it's in the Bible." But if someone asked
[21:07] me and said, "Would you baptize me in
[21:09] the name of the Father and of the Son
[21:11] and of the Holy Ghost?" I would say,
[21:13] "No, I won't because I don't think
[21:16] you're getting what the meaning of this
[21:18] is."
[21:21] So, three, I believe it is in God's
[21:26] plan. Now the Lord Jesus Christ is
[21:29] mentioned many times in the Bible. Acts
[21:32] 15:11 says, "We believe that through the
[21:35] grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we shall
[21:37] be saved even as they." Acts 15:26 as
[21:41] many men have hazarded their lives for
[21:44] the name of the our Lord Jesus Christ.
[21:47] And many more scriptures in Acts and
[21:49] Romans and 1 Corinthians say those
[21:51] words, Lord Jesus Christ. It's just when
[21:56] if you get into and I'm warning you, if
[21:58] you get into an argument maybe about
[22:01] baptisms and you say that no, you have
[22:04] to be baptized in the name of the Lord
[22:06] Jesus Christ, whoever's arguing with you
[22:08] might say, where is that in the Bible?
[22:10] And it's not there. I believe it's
[22:12] correct, as I said, or I wouldn't do it.
[22:17] But it's just,
[22:20] as I said, Lord's a title.
[22:23] Christ is a title. Jesus is is a name.
[22:26] So when somebody asked me if if they
[22:28] they want me to baptize according to the
[22:31] Bible, I'd say yes. But if they ask me
[22:34] the name of the father and of the son
[22:36] and of the holy spirit, I wouldn't do it
[22:38] because they don't understand the
[22:41] sovereignty of Jesus Christ. Matthew 28.
[22:45] And many many
[22:48] people think that well the disciples
[22:52] baptized the apostles baptized in the
[22:54] name of Jesus Christ. Jesus said to be
[22:57] bapt to baptize in the name of the
[22:59] father son and holy ghost. So I'll take
[23:03] what Jesus said over what the what the
[23:05] apostles said. That means the apostles
[23:08] who have the holy spirit are wrong.
[23:11] And that's that's not right. Now listen
[23:14] to this. Matthew 28, let's start with 18
[23:18] and then this will this will help you to
[23:21] understand what baptism is. Matthew
[23:23] 28:18 and Jesus came and spake unto them
[23:26] saying all power is given unto me in
[23:30] heaven and in earth.
[23:33] Go ye therefore and teach all nations,
[23:35] baptizing them in the name of the Father
[23:38] and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. So
[23:41] many times when we say in the name when
[23:43] the Bible says in the name it means with
[23:46] the authority of. All right.
[23:50] Jesus is saying to baptize them in the
[23:53] name
[23:54] and then he is saying all authority
[23:58] is given to me.
[24:01] So when we baptize,
[24:04] we baptize in the name of the man that
[24:08] all authority was given to.
[24:12] All authority, father, son, and holy
[24:14] ghost, all of the godhead, all of it is
[24:17] perfected in this man, Jesus Christ.
[24:21] So when we baptize, we are baptizing in
[24:24] the name of the one that all authority
[24:26] has been given to, and that's Jesus. So
[24:29] you take into the account of Matthew
[24:31] 28:18 and then you take in the book the
[24:34] account of the book of Acts and Romans
[24:36] where they always baptize in Jesus'
[24:38] name. And I think it's plain that we
[24:40] must baptize in that name. And I believe
[24:42] it is absolutely scriptural that we
[24:45] baptize in Jesus' name and not in those
[24:48] titles. And it's not as simple as just
[24:51] saying titles. You are baptizing with
[24:54] the authority
[24:56] in the name of the father and of the son
[24:58] and of the holy ghost. But there has to
[25:00] be a name associated with it. And of
[25:03] course we know that name is Jesus.
[25:07] Now I'm going to I'm going to try to get
[25:09] through fairly quickly and then I want
[25:11] to open it up to questions. That's why
[25:13] I'm saying some of these these topics
[25:15] that might be a little controversial.
[25:17] You might not understand. I want you to
[25:19] be able to ask questions here at the
[25:20] end. Let's um
[25:23] so we let's talk about this man named
[25:26] John the Baptist. So John the Baptist
[25:29] was
[25:31] an Old Testament prophet.
[25:35] We would say well he's in the New
[25:36] Testament but like Samuel was the last
[25:40] of the the judges. John the Baptist was
[25:46] an Old Testament prophet. Lukeapter 16:1
[25:50] 16 says this, "And the law and the
[25:52] prophets were until John since that time
[25:56] the kingdom of God is preached and every
[25:58] man presses into it." The amplified
[26:00] version of that says, "The law and the
[26:03] writings of the prophet prophets were
[26:05] proclaimed until John and since then the
[26:09] gospel of the kingdom of God has been
[26:11] and continues to be preached and
[26:13] everyone tries forcefully to go into
[26:16] it." So we see that John was a true
[26:20] prophet of God. And when he goes out and
[26:26] he starts baptizing,
[26:28] that is something that a prophet would
[26:30] do. It was something that wasn't usually
[26:34] didn't usually happen. So when the
[26:36] people saw John and he was going out and
[26:39] he was baptizing unto repentance, he was
[26:42] telling them, he says, he would say,
[26:44] "Now, do you repent of your sins? are
[26:46] you going to change your ways? Okay, I
[26:48] baptize you and you come back up and now
[26:51] go and don't sin anymore. And that's the
[26:53] way that John would baptize. And he was
[26:56] a he was and they looked at him, it's
[26:58] like, boy, this guy's a prophet. He's
[27:00] doing these things that only a prophet
[27:02] would do. They look in the Old
[27:03] Testament, they see this these these are
[27:05] bold things that John was doing. And
[27:08] they considered him a prophet. Now,
[27:11] let's go back to this 1 Corinthians 10.
[27:15] And I want to
[27:17] kind of explain this. And this is going
[27:19] to get us to Acts 19, which I read on my
[27:22] WhatsApp uh broadcast this morning. So,
[27:24] 1 Corinthians 10 verse one. I already
[27:27] read this. I want to read it again. It
[27:28] says this, "Moreover, brethren, I would
[27:31] not that you should that you should be
[27:33] ignorant how that all all our fathers
[27:37] were under the cloud and all passed
[27:39] through the sea. And all were baptized
[27:43] unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea."
[27:48] Amplified of that says, "And all of them
[27:50] were baptized into Moses, into his
[27:55] safekeeping as their leader in the cloud
[27:59] and in the sea." So they were really
[28:02] they were baptized into Moses's
[28:05] ministry.
[28:07] I was at the tomb of the prophets in
[28:10] just outside of Jerusalem. And uh I went
[28:13] to and there's there's three prophets,
[28:15] Malachi,
[28:17] um Haggi, and one other one. I forgot
[28:19] the other one. And the the man that was
[28:22] there, he was telling me that these
[28:24] prophets many times they were buried
[28:27] with their um disciples. They were
[28:29] buried like in the same tomb. And he
[28:31] told me this, and I don't know how true
[28:34] this is, but he said that many times
[28:36] that these their disciples in the Old
[28:40] Testament, these prophets, they would go
[28:42] into these mikvas, these pools, and they
[28:47] would
[28:49] go down into them, dedicating their life
[28:52] and and coming back up, dedicating their
[28:55] life to the ministry that this prophet
[28:58] had. And it's like a conversion. Then
[29:02] the the a conversion of someone
[29:04] converting to a Jew, they had to go
[29:06] through this ceremonial cleansing. And
[29:09] when John the Baptist
[29:12] was baptizing,
[29:14] these people were baptized into his
[29:18] baptism for this repentance. They were
[29:20] following him as a prophet. So when he
[29:23] said repent,
[29:26] it means change your ways.
[29:30] turn around
[29:32] and be baptized and don't do it again.
[29:35] Okay, that was the baptism of John. And
[29:38] they'd say, "Go and and don't sin
[29:40] anymore."
[29:41] So John's baptism, if you look at it, it
[29:46] was only to repentance.
[29:50] There was no remission of sins. There
[29:52] was no taking away of sins. There was no
[29:55] sacrifice
[29:56] of sins. And also with John's baptism
[30:00] that there was no promise associated
[30:03] with his baptism. Very important part.
[30:07] So again, he would baptize you. Do you
[30:09] do you repent of your sins? Do you do
[30:10] you want to change? He would baptize
[30:12] them. He'd say, "Okay, go and sin no
[30:14] more." But there was no promise
[30:16] associated. There was no wiping away of
[30:18] sins. There was just a covering that
[30:21] would be placed over the their sins.
[30:24] Just like in the Old Testament, there
[30:26] was no remission. There was no taking
[30:28] them away. And there was no promise of
[30:31] the Holy Ghost. So again, John is an Old
[30:35] Testament prophet here. Now, let's go to
[30:37] Matthew chapter 3 and start with verse
[30:40] 11. Now listen to this. This is John the
[30:42] Baptist speaking. And he says, "I indeed
[30:45] baptize you with water unto repentance,
[30:48] but he that cometh after me is mightier
[30:51] than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to
[30:54] bear, he shall baptize you with the Holy
[30:57] Ghost and fire."
[30:59] So John's preaching that this Messiah is
[31:02] coming and he's going to bapti and his
[31:04] baptism comes with the Holy Ghost. His
[31:07] baptism comes with a promise. So we look
[31:11] at the Old Testament and we see that the
[31:13] Holy Spirit would come upon people like
[31:15] in Isaiah he would say the spirit of the
[31:17] Lord was upon me or Samson the spirit of
[31:20] the Lord would come upon him and he
[31:22] would have this great strength and be
[31:24] able to to defeat the the the
[31:26] Philistines and here he is promising
[31:29] that that this spirit will come upon you
[31:32] and it won't leave.
[31:35] It'll be with you forever.
[31:37] It won't just come and go.
[31:40] This promise of this baptism of fire
[31:44] is is
[31:46] about as powerful as a promise of
[31:48] anywhere in the Bible. And it's
[31:50] associated with going through this
[31:52] baptism. So John's saying that he is not
[31:56] that this man that's coming is not going
[31:59] to just baptize you to repentance or
[32:01] just in water, but you have a promise
[32:03] that the fire of the Holy Ghost will
[32:05] dwell within you forever. Verse number
[32:08] 12, whose fan is in his hand, and he
[32:11] will thoroughly purge his floor, and
[32:13] gather his wheat into the garner, but he
[32:16] will burn up the chaff with unquenchable
[32:18] fire.
[32:22] Now,
[32:24] why would Jesus have to be baptized?
[32:28] So Jesus, write this next verse. Then
[32:31] cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto
[32:34] John to be baptized of him. Why would he
[32:36] have to be baptized of John? He was
[32:38] perfect. There was no sin.
[32:41] There was no repentance in Jesus. He
[32:43] didn't have to repent. And John's there
[32:46] baptizing for repentance. Why would
[32:48] Jesus have to come? Another symbolism,
[32:52] another symbolic thing that happens
[32:54] here. So Jesus comes and the lamb that
[32:59] was to be presented in the Old Testament
[33:02] as a sacrifice for our sin had to be
[33:05] washed
[33:06] before it could be presented to the
[33:08] priest and killed for our sin for the
[33:11] whoever sin it was. Jesus came not to be
[33:16] baptized because of repentance. Jesus
[33:20] came as a lamb to be washed before the
[33:24] sacrifice.
[33:26] So John recognized this
[33:30] and verse number 14.
[33:34] But John forbade him saying, "I have
[33:35] need to be baptized of thee and thou
[33:38] comest to me." So John recognizes, he's
[33:42] a prophet. He recognizes that you don't
[33:45] de need to repent. You are the lamb of
[33:47] God who takes away the sins of the
[33:49] world. I have need for you to baptize me
[33:51] with the Holy Ghost and the remission of
[33:53] my sins. And Jesus answered and said
[33:55] unto him, suffer it to be so now.
[33:59] For thus it is be thus it becometh us to
[34:02] fulfill all righteousness. Then he
[34:05] suffered him. Then John baptized him. So
[34:08] when a lamb was brought to the sacrifice
[34:10] in the Old Testament, it had to be
[34:12] washed before it was brought to the
[34:14] altar.
[34:16] And then remember John's bapt John's
[34:19] prophecy that when that with the baptism
[34:22] of Christ comes the promise of the
[34:24] receiving the Holy Ghost. Now watch what
[34:27] happens to Jesus. So here comes the
[34:29] lamb. He comes in. He is baptized. Now
[34:33] there's a promise associated with
[34:35] baptism of Christ. Now watch what
[34:37] happens next. And Jesus when he was
[34:39] baptized went up straightway out of the
[34:41] water. And lo, the heavens were open
[34:43] unto him, and he saw the spirit of God
[34:46] descending like a dove, and lighting
[34:48] upon him. And lo, a voice from heaven,
[34:50] saying, "This is my beloved son in whom
[34:53] I am well pleased." So there is the
[34:56] symbolic washing away of sins. And then
[34:58] there's the promise of receiving the
[35:01] Holy Ghost living inside of you. And
[35:03] here it does. It comes right down when
[35:06] Jesus is there. the Holy Spirit of
[35:08] promise that's going to be promised
[35:10] later on when we get to Peter in Acts
[35:13] chapter 2. Now, we have a baptism or we
[35:16] have a background with John the Baptist.
[35:19] He was a prophet and he baptized
[35:22] according he baptized to repentance. And
[35:25] people they even asked him, they said,
[35:28] "John, you're baptizing this way. are
[35:32] you a prophet
[35:36] or are you the Messiah? And John's like,
[35:38] "No, no, no. I'm" And then he quotes
[35:40] Isaiah saying, "I I am the voice of one
[35:42] crying in the wilderness."
[35:44] So
[35:46] he baptizes,
[35:48] makes a great name for himself, and then
[35:51] there is this man named Apollos. He was
[35:54] a Jew. He was a great preacher. He knew
[35:57] his scriptures backwards and forwards.
[35:59] He was a Christian. He was a mighty man,
[36:02] but he had not yet learned about some of
[36:04] these things like baptism yet. And all
[36:07] he knew was what he had learned from
[36:09] John the Baptist. He he knew to repent
[36:11] of your sins when you're baptized. And
[36:13] he also preached Jesus, but he had not
[36:16] yet received this revelation. Now,
[36:19] there's a famous couple in the chapter
[36:22] previous to Acts 19, chapter 18. this
[36:25] famous couple named Aquilla and
[36:27] Priscilla. They when when Apollos came
[36:32] and like I said, he was a very very
[36:33] gifted man, a great preacher. When
[36:34] Apollos came, they said, "You know what,
[36:37] Apollos, you're not quite there yet."
[36:41] And they explained to him some of these
[36:44] things like probably baptism. But
[36:46] Apollos had already preached and he
[36:50] already preached at this place called
[36:52] Ephesus to these 12 people that were
[36:55] there and he he preached Jesus and they
[36:59] got to know Jesus from this but they
[37:02] they didn't know about the Holy Ghost.
[37:04] They didn't know about this promise that
[37:06] is associated with baptism. So Acts 19
[37:10] reads like this verse one. And it came
[37:12] to pass that while Apollos was at
[37:14] Corenth, Paul having passed through the
[37:17] upper coasts, came to Ephesus, and
[37:20] finding certain disciples, he said unto
[37:23] them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost
[37:25] since you believed. And they said unto
[37:28] him, we have not so much as heard
[37:30] whether there be any Holy Ghost. And he
[37:32] said unto them, Unto what then were you
[37:35] baptized? And they said, unto John's
[37:39] baptism. So Paul had already been there,
[37:42] introduced them to the Lord, introduced
[37:44] them to salvation through Jesus Christ,
[37:47] but they didn't know about this baptism
[37:51] and the promise associated with it. So
[37:54] they were baptized according to John's
[37:57] ministry.
[37:59] It was good, but they stopped with John
[38:02] and they needed to go further to Christ.
[38:05] And John
[38:08] had
[38:10] John, of course, he was a prophet. He
[38:12] was to make make p make the way straight
[38:15] for the Lord. But even with John, and
[38:19] this is something that
[38:21] when you really dig into your Bible, you
[38:23] see that John
[38:26] after he introduced Jesus.
[38:29] John still had his disciples, many of
[38:32] them. And really the only ones I know
[38:35] for sure that did what John said
[38:39] were John, beloved disciple,
[38:42] and Andrew.
[38:45] And yet all of these other ones stayed
[38:47] with John, even to where they even got
[38:49] into arguments, the disciples of Jesus
[38:51] and the disciples of John. So John still
[38:54] had his that that followed him. Now
[38:59] listen to this. Then said Paul, verse
[39:02] number four. Then said Paul, John verily
[39:05] baptized with the baptism of repentance,
[39:07] saying unto the people that they should
[39:09] believe on him which should come after
[39:11] him, that is on Christ Jesus.
[39:15] So he didn't do what John said, folks is
[39:19] what he's saying. The baptism of the
[39:21] Holy Ghost didn't come from John's
[39:23] ministry. It came from Jesus's ministry.
[39:26] It came from Jesus's sacrifice. And and
[39:30] they were and Paul was explaining it's
[39:32] he was saying listen there is more to
[39:34] this. You can go deeper into this. This
[39:37] Jesus Christ is greater than you can
[39:39] ever imagine. And when they heard this
[39:42] they were baptized in the name of the
[39:44] Lord Jesus. And when Paul laid his hands
[39:46] on them, the Holy Ghost came on them and
[39:49] they spoke with tongues and they
[39:52] prophesied.
[39:53] They received that gift that was
[39:56] promised.
[39:58] All right. Now, we'll close, we'll
[40:00] finish up with Acts chapter 2. So,
[40:04] Peter,
[40:07] so now we have a foundation of what this
[40:09] baptism is. Now, let's see this first
[40:12] application of true baptism. So, Peter
[40:16] in Acts chapter 2,
[40:19] he had received the Holy Spirit with 120
[40:22] of them in the upper room. And then
[40:23] Peter goes out and he preaches Jesus
[40:27] Christ.
[40:29] And you know what happened? You remember
[40:31] the sermon on Sunday in the biatitudes?
[40:35] The people they were the Bible says that
[40:38] they were cut in their hearts. They they
[40:42] were they felt bad for their sins.
[40:46] Remember blessed are the poor in spirit
[40:49] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. You
[40:51] have to realize that you are nothing.
[40:53] Blessed are they that mourn for they
[40:55] shall be comforted. They were seeing
[40:57] that that they had done wrong and they
[41:00] needed forgiveness. They they needed
[41:03] something other they than what they had.
[41:05] They felt terrible for their sins that
[41:08] they had done. And then blessed are the
[41:09] meek for they shall inherit the earth.
[41:11] They were meek and they came to Peter
[41:13] and they said, "Listen, we're not right.
[41:16] We want what you have."
[41:19] They were showing all of those steps of
[41:22] becoming a Christian. They understood
[41:24] that they needed help. They they felt
[41:26] bad for their sins. And now they're
[41:28] humble enough to say that they want the
[41:30] same Holy Spirit that Peter had.
[41:34] Now when they had heard this what Peter
[41:36] had preached, they were pricricked in
[41:39] their heart
[41:41] and said unto Peter and to the rest of
[41:43] the apostles, "Men and brethren, what
[41:44] shall we do?" It's a good question.
[41:48] I feel bad for
[41:50] I need to do something. What can I do?
[41:53] Then Peter said unto them, repent. All
[41:56] right. John the Baptist is his baptism
[42:01] was repent. Which means you you feel bad
[42:04] for what you've done. Now you go and you
[42:06] make a commitment to change. Repentance
[42:09] is very important with baptism. That's
[42:12] why again the Catholic Church, they just
[42:13] butchered this whole thing. They
[42:15] baptized babies. How can a baby be
[42:17] baptized? How can a baby repent? They
[42:20] don't know what they do wrong.
[42:23] You cannot understand baptism. You can't
[42:26] be truly baptized correctly unless there
[42:29] is that repentance that you feel bad for
[42:31] what you've done and then you want to
[42:33] make it right. You want to make a change
[42:34] in your life. Peter said Peter said unto
[42:38] them, repent first and be baptized every
[42:42] one of you in the name of Jesus Christ.
[42:47] Remember Acts 28 or Matthew 28:19. All
[42:51] power is given unto me. All the power in
[42:54] heavens and earth everywhere is given to
[42:57] this man named Jesus Christ. And that is
[43:00] the name that we take on. And that is
[43:03] why Peter here said that you are
[43:05] baptized in this name.
[43:07] And Peter said unto them,"Repent and be
[43:10] baptized, every one of you, in the name
[43:12] of Jesus Christ, for the remission of
[43:16] your sins." The remission of sins, the
[43:19] taking away of sins. Now, Peter is
[43:22] saying like, "Listen, you can have your
[43:24] sins forgiven. You can be you can be
[43:27] completely made whole." This man, Jesus
[43:29] Christ, was the true lamb of God. He was
[43:31] the sacrificial lamb. He takes away the
[43:34] sins of the world. Jesus is everything
[43:38] and he died for you
[43:41] for the remission of sins.
[43:45] Now, here's the promise
[43:47] associated with baptism.
[43:50] And you shall receive the gift of the
[43:54] Holy Ghost. Look at the difference
[43:56] between Jesus's baptism. That's why it
[43:58] didn't work in Acts 19. It didn't work
[44:01] for the Ephesians. Look at the
[44:03] difference between Jesus's baptism and
[44:05] John's baptism. The repent part was the
[44:08] same, but now we have remission. We have
[44:10] taking away of sins. And we have the
[44:13] promise of the Holy Ghost when you're
[44:14] baptized in that name. For this promise
[44:18] is unto you and your children, and to
[44:22] all that are far off, even as many as
[44:25] the Lord our God shall call.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; So, it's a promise all the way to us.
[44:32] So, do you see the importance of
[44:34] baptism? It's symbolic.
[44:37] Yes, it is symbolic. When you are
[44:39] baptized up in the water and I put you
[44:42] down, it symbolizes in um I believe it's
[44:44] Romans chapter 6, it symbolizes going
[44:47] down into the grave, but you don't die.
[44:50] And when I bring you back up, it
[44:53] symbolizes being resurrected, a new
[44:55] person, but you are not a new person.
[44:58] and you come up out of the water and the
[45:00] water symbolizes washing away of all of
[45:03] your sins. But it doesn't wash those
[45:05] away. Everything goes back to Jesus
[45:09] Christ.
[45:10] We do it because it is a commandment and
[45:14] it represents something greater. But we
[45:17] must do it because the Bible commands
[45:20] it. And then if we do that, then we have
[45:23] that promise. Are you with me? That is
[45:27] baptism.
[45:28] Lord,
[45:30] I feel bad for what I've done.
[45:34] I feel
[45:37] that I have sinned and I need
[45:39] forgiveness.
[45:42] And that starts the progression. And the
[45:45] very first thing is baptism.
[45:49] and you go up there and you are baptized
[45:52] according to the word of God in the name
[45:56] of the Lord Jesus
[45:58] taking on that name it that's why the
[46:01] name is so important friends we have to
[46:03] take on a name
[46:06] calling ourselves Christians Christ is
[46:08] there we want that name associated with
[46:11] us we want Jesus associated with us we
[46:14] want to be a Christian so we have to
[46:16] take up on that name not of Christ as I
[46:19] says the title but of Jesus Jesus Christ
[46:22] that is the name that we want and that
[46:25] is the name we are baptized in and we
[46:27] are baptized into his body
[46:31] baptism all right so now I finished
[46:36] early and I did it for a reason I hit
[46:40] some subjects that you've probably never
[46:42] heard before
[46:44] I I said some things but they're correct
[46:46] according to the Bible so what questions
[46:48] questions do you have?
[46:53] Come on,
[46:55] Sister Ed.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Okay, I'll get you.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Sure. Very good question. So, brother
[47:18] Aaron says that I was baptized wrong.
[47:21] Let's say I was baptized in the titles
[47:23] of the father and the son and of the
[47:24] holy ghost.
[47:26] Should I be rebaptized?
[47:30] You didn't take on a name
[47:34] if you were baptized in those titles.
[47:37] Now, are you going to be saved? Sure. I
[47:40] believe if you gave your heart to the
[47:41] Lord Jesus, you'll be saved. But you
[47:43] didn't do it right.
[47:45] And we want to do everything right. So
[47:47] no, I would say yes, you should be
[47:49] baptized according to Christian baptism,
[47:51] according to what the what the apostles
[47:54] said and yes, you need to take on that
[47:56] name of Jesus Christ to to be in baptism
[48:00] if you really if you want to do it right
[48:02] and if you want to do it according to
[48:04] the word. And the second question
[48:07] brother Aaron asked is I've been
[48:08] baptized before once or twice or three
[48:11] times or whatever it might be, but I
[48:12] have sinned after I bapt I was baptized.
[48:16] Should I be rebaptized?
[48:18] No,
[48:20] that is not a requirement. You are
[48:23] baptized once.
[48:26] And will you sin? Yes.
[48:30] Paul said, he said, "All have sinned and
[48:33] come short of the glory of God." Paul
[48:36] said, "I have to die daily." You are
[48:39] going to sin.
[48:41] But you can go back and you can say,
[48:44] "But I was baptized in the name of Jesus
[48:48] Christ." And you may have received the
[48:50] gift of the Holy Ghost and still sinned,
[48:53] but you just you just backsliden.
[48:56] You come back to the Lord and you say,
[48:59] "Lord, I remember that day that I went
[49:01] up into the pool."
[49:03] And maybe you might think,
[49:06] you know, I didn't do it right. I didn't
[49:08] repent. I wasn't I wasn't baptized,
[49:11] right?
[49:13] Should I get rebaptized? I would say,
[49:15] you know, it's up to it's up to you. I
[49:18] say, if if this is going to be something
[49:19] that hinders you, if this is going to be
[49:22] something that really bothers you, that
[49:24] that's going to that's going to
[49:27] cause you anxiety. Yeah, be baptized.
[49:30] Again, sure, there's nothing wrong with
[49:32] it. You're not sinning when you do it.
[49:35] But is it required? I would say no.
[49:39] Does that answer your question, brother?
[49:41] Sister Esther.
[50:01] So the sister said that that she was
[50:03] baptized when she was 18. She backslid
[50:07] for a period of time and then she came
[50:09] back to the Lord. Should be she be
[50:11] rebaptized?
[50:13] And it's a slightly different question,
[50:14] but it's it's similar. And I would ask
[50:18] you,
[50:20] were you sincere the first time?
[50:49] such a beautiful attitude. So
[50:53] she said that
[50:55] that yes, she was sincere when she was
[50:58] first baptized, but she wants to make
[51:00] sure that everything is in order.
[51:03] And let me tell you, there's something
[51:05] that we do
[51:08] that requires us to have everything in
[51:11] order. And that is another ordinance,
[51:15] another thing that is symbolic and that
[51:17] is communion.
[51:21] Bible says to let a man examine himself.
[51:25] And we should do that. We should do it
[51:27] every day really. But that communion,
[51:30] that's why it's important that we take
[51:31] it.
[51:32] It's because it enforces us to say,
[51:35] "Lord, am I right in what I'm doing? Is
[51:39] this correct? Am I handling this these
[51:42] things in the right way? Have I
[51:43] backsliden?" And if you have, then you
[51:46] get right with God because you don't
[51:48] want to take that cup or eat that bread
[51:53] unworthily.
[51:55] You want to have your heart right. And
[51:57] sister, I'd say that if you have truly
[51:59] if you have truly given your heart to
[52:00] the Lord Jesus and you have backslid,
[52:05] then the angels are rejoicing that
[52:06] you've come back.
[52:08] Do you have to do you have to get
[52:09] rebaptized?
[52:11] No. Do you if you want to? Sure. But do
[52:15] you have to? Not Not from the scriptures
[52:18] that I see. No.
[52:20] Another question.
[52:26] anyone all the uh brother if you could
[52:28] come and the worship team could come and
[52:33] be sure there's no other questions. This
[52:35] baptism is a very important thing but
[52:37] like I said don't over complicate it.
[52:40] It's symbolic
[52:43] and it's it it is vitally important but
[52:46] it's also super simple.
[52:49] It's I go into the water to be washed.
[52:54] the word ba the the very word baptism it
[52:57] doesn't mean sprinkling it doesn't mean
[52:59] pouring the the definition of the word
[53:03] so when when someone I know the
[53:06] Catholics think that they they can
[53:07] change it but you can't it means what it
[53:10] means it means to be immersed in water
[53:14] and when you are immersed in water and
[53:17] you come out of that water it represents
[53:21] a death
[53:23] a burial
[53:25] and a resurrection
[53:27] in Christ. And when I baptize me
[53:31] personally, I love to baptize in those
[53:34] na in those three words, Lord Jesus
[53:38] Christ. As I read, there's many
[53:40] scriptures that give that precedence
[53:43] that that that Lord Jesus Christ is
[53:46] correct. No one was baptized that way in
[53:50] the Bible, but it means the same thing.
[53:54] It's a name.
[53:56] If you've ever heard brother Brandham
[53:58] baptize
[54:01] water baptism,
[54:03] one time he baptizes, I baptize you in
[54:06] the name of the Lord Jesus. I baptize
[54:08] you in the the same sermon. I baptize
[54:10] you in the name of Jesus Christ. I
[54:12] baptize you in the name of the Lord
[54:13] Jesus Christ. for him.
[54:16] Even in one sermon, it was it was
[54:18] different ways, but it was the same way
[54:22] because it was Jesus. And that is the
[54:25] main thing.
[54:27] You with me, brother Joe?
[55:40] Brother Joe, Brother Joe said that is
[55:43] warning that we have to be careful
[55:46] in I'm going to put words in your mouth
[55:48] and say judging
[55:51] someone else because they weren't
[55:52] baptized in the same manner that we are.
[55:55] And of course that's wrong. And let me
[55:58] give you an example of having that wrong
[56:02] kind of attitude. There was a man
[56:07] on the cross.
[56:10] Jesus
[56:12] was there
[56:15] and this man repented of his sins
[56:20] was not baptized.
[56:23] Wasn't baptized at all that we know of.
[56:27] There wasn't any baptizing in the name
[56:29] of Jesus Christ back then anyways.
[56:34] But he wherever Jesus went,
[56:37] that man that was on the cross went with
[56:40] him.
[56:42] So if we are going to judge someone else
[56:45] on their baptism, then we are wrong and
[56:49] we are in danger that Jesus in danger of
[56:53] breaking the commandment that Jesus said
[56:55] and judge not that you be not judged.
[56:59] So when if if someone is baptized in
[57:02] those titles,
[57:06] then I just pray pray that they've given
[57:09] their heart to the Lord Jesus and then
[57:11] let that work it out. But as far as this
[57:13] church,
[57:15] if someone asks me,
[57:18] then I will tell them that I believe and
[57:21] I can back it up with scripture most
[57:23] certainly that baptism in the name of
[57:26] Jesus Christ is the right way.
[57:29] But as far as someone else, Brother Joe,
[57:31] you are absolutely right. We cannot
[57:32] think we're any better than anyone else.
[57:35] And we cannot judge someone else. That's
[57:38] most certainly true. Amen.
[57:41] Anyone else
[57:44] over there?
[57:53] Have your way.
[57:59] Have your way.
[58:02] [Music]
[58:05] Holy Spirit,
[58:08] fill our hearts and have your way.
[58:16] [Music]
[58:18] As we wait
[58:21] [Music]
[58:23] and as we pray,
[58:28] [Music]
[58:30] speak your word into our hearts and have
[58:37] your way.
[58:40] [Music]
[58:42] Have your way.
[58:44] [Music]
[58:48] Have your way.
[58:51] [Music]
[58:54] Holy Spirit,
[58:57] fill our hearts and have your way.
[59:04] [Music]
[59:06] As we wait
[59:10] [Music]
[59:12] and as we pray,
[59:15] [Music]
[59:18] speak your word into our home and have
[59:26] your way.
[59:27] And
[59:29] and friends, I do want
[59:33] to solidify
[59:36] what I said
[59:38] in saying that the word teaches baptism.
[59:44] And the word teaches,
[59:46] I believe, baptism
[59:49] being fully immersed in water in the
[59:51] name of Jesus Christ.
[59:54] We can't change the word.
[59:57] And if someone asks me and said and says
[1:00:00] that, and I'll reiterate what I said to
[1:00:02] you, Brother Joe. If they truly ask me
[1:00:05] and they and they truly want to know,
[1:00:06] was I baptized right and they were
[1:00:08] baptized in the Trinitarian baptism, I
[1:00:11] would say, you know, it just doesn't
[1:00:12] line up with the word.
[1:00:14] As far as my understanding, and it's
[1:00:17] pretty plain how the disciples baptized
[1:00:21] that no
[1:00:23] And baptism is symbolic,
[1:00:29] but
[1:00:30] it's also real and it's also a
[1:00:34] commandment from God
[1:00:36] to do things in the way that the Bible
[1:00:39] says and we cannot change it. Sometimes
[1:00:42] it is hard to interpret when you see two
[1:00:46] different scriptures that don't seem to
[1:00:48] make sense. But I believe they do make
[1:00:49] sense when when you take into
[1:00:52] account that all power
[1:00:55] and all authority is is given unto me. I
[1:00:59] think that that does that does answer
[1:01:01] the question that that that name of
[1:01:03] Jesus is contains all the power of God
[1:01:06] and all the fullness of the godhead
[1:01:09] bodily. Let's bow our heads. Brother
[1:01:11] Aaron, would you close in prayer?
[1:01:15] Lord, it's it shows how much you care
[1:01:18] for us.
[1:01:20] You know, as humans, we we make
[1:01:22] mistakes. We have our own thoughts,
[1:01:24] Lord. But our heart's desire is first of
[1:01:27] all to please you
[1:01:29] and to obey, Lord.
[1:01:32] Father, but help us to have a spirit,
[1:01:34] Lord, that the spirit of Christ in us
[1:01:37] would reach out to others, not in a
[1:01:40] negative or a harsh way or
[1:01:43] but with love. And if they would see
[1:01:45] Christ in us, they would want that same
[1:01:48] Lord. to let us be a good testimony of
[1:01:51] Jesus Christ. Lord, as we go, Lord, may
[1:01:54] you watch over us and may your name be
[1:01:57] praised in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:02:02] You deserve the glory
[1:02:09] and the honor.
[1:02:12] [Music]
[1:02:15] Lord, we lift our hands in worship
[1:02:22] as we lift your holy name.
[1:02:28] You deserve the glory
[1:02:30] [Music]
[1:02:34] and the honor.
[1:02:37] [Music]
[1:02:40] Lord, we lift our hands in worship
[1:02:46] as we lift your holy name. For you are
[1:02:53] great.
[1:02:56] You do miracles
[1:02:59] so great.
[1:03:01] There is no one else like you.
[1:03:07] [Music]
[1:03:10] There is no one else like you. For you
[1:03:17] are great.
[1:03:19] You do miracles
[1:03:22] so great.
[1:03:25] There is no one else like you.
[1:03:33] There is no
[1:03:36] one else like you.
[1:03:45] You deserve the glory
[1:03:49] [Music]
[1:03:51] and the honor.
[1:03:54] [Music]
[1:03:57] Lord, I lift my hands in worship
[1:04:03] as I lift your holy name.
[1:04:08] You deserve the glory
[1:04:15] and the higher.
[1:04:20] Lord, I lift my hand in worship.
[1:04:27] as I lift your holy name. For you are
[1:04:33] great.
[1:04:36] You do miracles
[1:04:39] so great.
[1:04:41] There is no one else like you.
[1:04:47] [Music]
[1:04:50] There is no one else like you. For you
[1:04:56] are great.
[1:04:59] You do miracles
[1:05:02] so great.
[1:05:05] There is no one else like you.
[1:05:13] There is no
[1:05:16] one
[1:05:17] else
[1:05:19] like you.
[1:05:23] God bless you, brothers and sisters. As
[1:05:26] always,
[1:05:28] if you have any questions, please get
[1:05:30] them to me and I'll do my best to answer
[1:05:35] them. If you think that the church
[1:05:36] should hear them, then write them out
[1:05:39] and I'll do my best to answer them. But
[1:05:42] this question on baptism is a very, very
[1:05:45] important question. But it is also a
[1:05:47] very very simple thing that we take on
[1:05:51] that name of baptism
[1:05:54] and it symbolizes
[1:05:57] a great work that's happening in our
[1:05:59] lives and let me tell you it also
[1:06:01] symbolizes
[1:06:03] a great great promise and that is the
[1:06:07] baptism of the Holy Spirit. God bless
[1:06:10] you. Pray that the Lord will be with you
[1:06:13] this Sunday if the Lord's willing. I
[1:06:15] will continue on.
