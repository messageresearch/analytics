and father we could learn about your word for it means so much to us in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you all you can take your seats Jonathan it's good to have you back my brother Jonathan was um did you make it to Sunset good good so brother Jonathan was in he was at Sunset down uh if you're not familiar with it down really in the middle of nowhere in Arizona near a little town called Klondike that sometimes has a store there and sometimes it doesn't but it always has a few ranchers in the area and it was a special place to brother Branham a lot of powerful things happened there and it's a special place to all of us that we could go there and they've shut it down I don't know it's probably been closed off for about the past 10 years or so um so uh brother Jonathan I think in the brothers have covertly found a way that if you go through the desert and you take a left at the big Saguaro you go down there and you take a ride at the big rock and then you follow the ridge down and you make sure you don't step to the left because you fall you'll go down and then you take a trail down and you watch the rattlesnakes and and you get down into the wash and then you walk to the wash and you get to the spot am I right is that about where it's at it's that's I've been there before you know it's a special place we we know what happened there we know that that brother Branham had a couple very powerful experiences once with a whirlwind and once once with the blast where he was given Revelation to go back and the Lord was going to reveal the Seven Seals to him and some special very very special things happen there and we go there in remembrance of these things just as Joshua at gilgal He piled up these 12 Stones to remind the people that when when you come here and and when the your children ask what me Me by these stones that you can tell them the story that happened and point them to to this the reason that this rock is here brother is is because it's a it's a monument to what happened there at sunset and we always need to remember that it's not the Rock there that it's just a rock and it's not those stones that Joshua piled up they're just Stones they don't mean anything but it's those Lively Stones as Peter said it's those living stones that it was is what matters today those things give us encouragement but it's this vessel right here that is filled with the holy spirit that is what matters that is what God uses but those places are special to us brother Jonathan I'm glad that you got to go and with the kindness of the brothers to take you down there I know it was a special trip to you I've been there many times as I said many special things have happened to me down there um like to uh announce um not this coming weekend but next Friday so not this closest Friday but the following Friday I want to do something for the younger youth you all back there do you want to do something raise your hand good all right um I want to do something for them so that'll be not this coming Friday but the following Friday I've already got it on the calendar at the tucsontabernacle.com you can look it up there and then um as I've said before we have the meetings at Jericho Tabernacle in Phoenix this weekend brother Aaron McGarry will be preaching Friday night I'll be preaching Saturday night brother Steve Robson will be preaching on Sunday morning and I'm thinking about renting a van and uh and getting a couple hotel rooms if some of the brothers want to go um just get in touch with me if you'd be interested in going up we'll probably go up on Friday stay Friday night and then come home after service on Saturday night so so yeah so if you want to go just get in touch with me and if we get enough then we'll get a van and if not I can just drive my vehicle um looking forward to that brother Octavio is the pastor of Jericho Tabernacle uh they've got a big group I think they have like 300 people in the church looking forward to going up there uh brother Aaron and brother Steve and I we're always we're friends so we're in contact a lot but we haven't told each other what we're going to minister on and and brother Octavio said there's no subject just do whatever's on your heart so we'll see how the Lord leads there I'm anxious to see what these other brothers are going to be preaching about um we're for our visitors God bless you brothers from Quebec welcome it's good to have you we're we're always honored that someone that we'd get visitors with us the um I uh you used to be really close friends I'm still friends with the brother George Ferguson I assume you know him he's he's a he's a good friend a close brother there and um yeah it just just welcome thank you thank you for coming we've been studying on Wednesday nights and sometimes Sunday nights we've been studying on the book of Acts we started in chapter one and now we're in chapter seven chapter seven tonight brother Lyle had just preached on chapter six and in chapter 6 we see these seven men that come on the scene these very very special men as brother Lyle pointed out they were Hellenist Jews they weren't the the Jews that maybe were from the the um country of Israel but they were Greek they spoke Greek and they were they were great men of God at towards the end of chapter six we see that they bring this young man named Stephen they bring him to trial and Stephen is I don't know if I've seen a preacher in the Bible as well versed in the scriptures as this man Stephen he's not just telling a story brother Lyle as he goes as he goes through this this defense that he has when he's on trial he is typing things perfectly from the Old Testament and he's bringing them down and he's putting them in here and relating them to this man Jesus and they say you know what let's uh maybe let's just read it in uh in Acts chapter six let's start with a little bit of review from where brother Lyle stopped off Let's uh let's start with verse 10 here and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spake right there then they stubborn men which said we have heard him speak Blasphemous words now this is very important we have heard him speak Blasphemous words against Moses and against God and they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes and they came upon him and caught him and brought him to the council and to set up false Witnesses which said this man ceases not to speak Blasphemous words against this holy Place speaking of the Temple against this holy place and the law so we see that that they're accusing this man Stephen of speaking Blasphemous words against God against Moses against the temple and against the law for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place and shall change the Customs which Moses delivered us and all that sat in the council looking steadfast on him steadfastly on him saw his face as it had been the face of an Angel and then we go to we go to chapter seven here and you'll notice as Stephen as he brings his defense against these these um priests he brings it in and you'll see if Peter has done this too he brings it in a historical context and this historical context was very important to the Jewish people it was obviously important because I don't know except for maybe the the cuttings on on the the pyramid walls and that type of thing I don't know of any ancient writings that have been preserved like these Jewish writings this thing that we called the Bible so this this these writings of their ancestors and of their prophets they were very very important to the Jews this history was very important so we see as Stephen begins his defense we see that he brings it into a historical context Peter had already done that but now it's in Stephen's writings it's much more uh detailed than it has been and it turns out it is an absolutely tremendous Serv sermon that this man preached and he was a deacon standing before it says here the council standing before the council these Pharisees and Sadducees there who were we would call them phds today studied this stuff their whole life knew it backwards and forwards and here we see this Hellenist Jew come in and he can match wits with the best of them and we see we see Stephen and he starts to speak and I look and I I see that there's there's people here and it says here that there's people present one of those present that we know is present is none other than a protege of one of the greatest most reputable Pharisees in all the land which is this man Gamaliel so we have this young man over here who's mentioned at the end of the chapter that I'm talking about and then we have this other young man Stephen this deacon both of them are here both of them are very on very very opposite sides one young man over here this Pharisee he is bent on destroying this new cult this new movement among the Jews he hates it and then we have this man Stephen over here and it's everything to see him get this gospel out about this man named Jesus Christ verse number one then said the high priest are these things so and Stephen said this men and brethren and fathers hearken the god of Glory appeared unto our Father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia before he dwelt in Karen and said unto him get thee out of thy country and from my Kindred and come into the land which I shall show thee now Stephen here is probably standing he probably doesn't have any scrolls with him I doubt very seriously that he would have that and you're going to see in this as we go through this chapter that this young man knows this book backwards and forwards then came he out speaking of Abraham here then he came then came he out of the land of the Chaldeans and dwelt and Karen and from thence when his father was dead he removed him into this land wherein you now dwell and he gave him not inheritance in it no not so much as to set his foot on yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession and to his seed after him when as yet he had no child now remember the story of Abraham that he he had his wife Sarah they had no children but God had made a promise to Abraham that he would not only have a child but his offspring his descendants would number like the stars in the sky and God spake on this wise that his seeds should sojourn in a Strange Land and that they should bring them into bondage and then treat them evil 400 years now I mentioned that this morning this was fulfilled when Joseph came Joseph dies Joseph brings his family to Egypt he dies his family stays there and this family is there in Egypt for 400 years in the nation to whom they shall be judged will be in bondage will I judge said God and after that shall they come forth and serve me in this place now he's talking about he's prophesying he's saying here that that I'm going to judge this that I'm going to bring these people out of this Egypt with a mighty hand through a deliverer and he gave him the Covenant of circumcision and so Abraham begat Isaac and circumcised him the Eighth Day and Isaac begat Jacob and Jacob began to 12 Patriarchs now this Covenant of circumcision that's gonna this is gonna come into play a little bit later in the chapter and the Patriarchs moved with envy and sold Joseph into Egypt but God was with him now look at look at the wisdom of this Deacon preacher here he's laying the foundation with the story of Joseph who was rejected of his brethren they were his Brethren were jealous of him they tried to murder him but yet against all the obstacles he was thrown in prison and everywhere else God was with this man Joseph and this Deacon preacher here Stephen is establishing a pattern of the Jews rejecting the gifts that God gave them very important in this sermon he even he even says he he says I think that he's referring to that he came to his own and his own received him not John chapter 1 . now remember Joseph was rejected of his own brethren so he went to the Gentiles with potiphar and pharaoh and and he prospered there and delivered him out of all his afflictions and gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of pharaoh king of Egypt and may he made him a governor over Egypt and all his house now there came a Darth over all the land of Egypt and in Canaan and great Affliction and our fathers found no substance substance so there was a famine That Came Upon all of this land of Egypt but when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt he sent our fathers first very very important point that brother Stephen makes here and it's very subtle but it's just absolutely tremendous Stephen says this and at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren and Joseph's Kindred was made known to pharaoh so Joseph grew up with all these people just like Jesus grew up in Nazareth and in Capernaum and in Galilee and they rejected rejected Joseph here at the beginning but Joseph's Second Coming remember they thought he was dead and they threw him in the well they picked them up they threw him into prison and they thought that he was gone but upon Joseph's Second Coming the second time he introduces to his brethren then they knew him what a prophetic sermon this is this is D this isn't just history this is like amazing interpretation by this man Stephen very very deep then sent Joseph and called his father Jacob to him and all his Kindred three score and 15 Souls so Jacob went down into Egypt and he died he and our fathers and were carried over to secum and laid in the Sepulcher that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of emor the father of SEC of second but when the time of the promise Drew Nai which God had sworn to Abraham the people grew and multiplied in Egypt to until another king arose which which knew not Joseph now I mentioned that this morning that all of the blessings that Joseph had all of everything that Joseph he stored up the grain and you know the story and and he really saved the whole country of Egypt to where all the countries round about were coming to Egypt to get this grain and this new Pharaoh after all of these years some 400 years or so he raised up and he didn't know the history of this man Joseph this savior really of Egypt and this talking about this man this this Empire that was ruling over the people at this time this Egypt it ruled them harshly now remember all of this our brother Stephen is typing so we see this Gentile group this Egypt and they are ruling over this these Jews these Hebrews and if we look the same thing was happening when Jesus came it wasn't Egypt that was ruling over but it was a gentile group called Rome and now they are ruling over this group of Hebrews and he's bringing this down through history and the same dealt subtly with our kindred and evil entreated our fathers so that they cast out their young children to the end to the end that they might not live so we know this story so here we have Moses and and here he is Stephen is laying again the foundation and he's saying remember when Moses was here and remember they were taking the babies and they were throwing them in the Nile River and they were killing them they were there was too many of them so they were taking these these these kids and they were throwing in them in the river killing them the crocodiles were eating them they were all dialing dying and this is when Moses was here guess what was happening some I don't know 33 34 years before Stephen preached this we have this man Herod and he is saying kill every boy below this certain age because of this prophecy that was going to happen the same thing was happening here in Jesus's time as in with Moses's time and and Stephen is laying this Foundation saying look what is going on here remember they had accused him of blaspheming Moses now Stephen here you know he's remember he's on trial and Stephen here is lifting up Moses like I'm not blasphemy blast blaspheming him I'm not speaking against Moses Moses was a great man and he's showing that that this Moses and he's that look at what happened to him and he's gonna get to a scripture a little bit later that's gonna just clinch it all together verse number 20. in which time Moses was born and was exceeding fair and nourished up in his father's house house three months and when he was cast out Pharaoh's daughter took him up and nourished him for her own son remember they put him in the basket and soaked it with pitch and and uh and amram puts it in the water and it and it floats it floats down and then I believe his Pharaoh's daughter or sister takes it out and calls him Moses because he was drawn from the water and Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was mighty in words and indeed so he's like Hey listen Moses was great and when he was a full 40 years old it came into his heart to visit his Brethren the children of Israel and seeing one of them suffer wrong he defended him and Avenged him that was oppressed and smote the Egyptian for he was supposed for he supposed he thought his Brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them but they understood not right here another really powerful scripture right here he's saying Moses already knew he was the deliverer but they didn't understand it again a parallel between Moses and Jesus we see here that Moses was sent to his own as a deliverer but they didn't understand him the gift that Moses was and here we have Jesus again sent to his own people they did the same to him and the next day he showed himself unto them as they strove and would have set them at one again saying sirs you are Brethren why do you wrong to one another but he that did his neighbor wrong thrust him away saying who made thee a ruler and a judge over us here again Moses is rejected by his own people look at what Stephen is doing he's just reiterating himself over the leader that God raised up to deliver the people he was not accepted now Moses at this time he's about 40 years old and he was willing at this point let me let me stop for a minute right there Moses at 40 years old really the prime of his life he had this revelation and look at the character in this man Moses he was willing to give it all up all of the riches that he had everything that he was maybe even in line to be a pharaoh to be the next king but Moses was willing to he was willing to forsake it all and uh let me read that again he said they said to Moses who made you a ruler and a judge over us and this Hebrew that was saying that must have really resented Moses he's like oh you grew up privileged you know you're you're not like us how dare you Moses you don't know what we're suffering you don't know who we are and you think that you're able to come right in and and take over and do what you want to do and look at what the priests said to Jesus they said the same thing who made you a ruler over us Jesus who Do You Think You Are in so much that um what was the guy's name um that uh Pilate took a sign and he he inscribed on it the king of the Jews put it up there and then the Jew said no no no no no don't put up that up there he's not our King you know he says no what you need to put is is he says he's the king of the Jews pilate said I'll put up there what I put up there I've written what I've written amen and he put it up there the same Spirit who made you a King Jesus who made you this Messiah over here they said Moses who made you a ruler over us you were privileged you came up to the Egyptians you're an Egyptian man stay away from us then he says this and he knew he had the goods on Moses he said will thou kill me as thou didst the Egyptian yesterday he had witnessed that Moses in trying to protect one of his own people trying to protect the Hebrew Moses went to battle and killed this Egyptian and here is his own his own man his own race of people selling him out look at what they did to Jesus they said ah Caesar's our King not this guy The Same Spirit this is over a thousand years later that Jesus is there and the same spirit that was on these men back when Moses was here they're attacking Jesus with almost exactly the same words wow and here is this this Deacon preacher young man bringing it out I just I'm in awe of the wisdom of this man Stephen then fled Moses at this saying and was a stranger in the land of Midian where he begat two sons he lived in isolation for the next 40 years and brother Branham said he said that it took 40 years for him to get trained up in the ways of the Egyptian of the Egyptians and then brother Branham said it took another 40 years for God to get all of that out of him [Applause] and when 40 years were expired there appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai an angel of the Lord in the flame of a fire and a bush speaking of the burning bush how common God uses fire to represent him of course we saw it in the burning bush we see the fire coming in the Tabernacle of the Lord when when the presence of the Lord entered we see fire come down at Mount Carmel with Elijah we see fire coming in the temple when Solomon finished it we see tongues of fire over the heads of the people at the day of Pentecost and when Moses saw it he wandered at the site as he drew near to behold it and the voice of the Lord came unto him saying I am the god of thy fathers the god of Abraham and the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob then Moses trembled and did not behold he didn't even look at it he was so afraid of this that was coming out of that bush he knew that the presence of the Lord was there then said the Lord to him put off thy shoes from thy feet for the place where thou standeth is Holy Ground I have seen I have seen the Affliction of my people which is in Egypt and I have heard they're groaning and have come down to deliver them and now come I will send thee to Egypt this little scripture right here is a real blessing to me it shows me that the tender loving hand of Jehovah he's got that ear down to his people and when they start crying out to God that's when God listens he didn't say this was prophesied to come that's why I did it he didn't say that this this was the way I was going to do it in the first place or anything like that it was but he said this I heard my people how beautiful how sweet our Lord is where am I at 30 35. and this Moses whom they refused saying who made thee a ruler and a judge the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the Angel which appeared to him in the bush he's saying here that it didn't matter if they rejected him God still made him the ruler and the deliverer it didn't matter how they voted it didn't matter how that what they thought it didn't matter if they didn't like Moses god The Sovereign God who does things the way he wants to do them he made Moses the man and he brought them out and after that he showed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the wilderness 40 years so this is that Moses which said unto the children of Israel a prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall ye hear this is key very very important because here we have again Stephen is showing his knowledge of the scriptures he's going all the way back to the book of Deuteronomy and he's he's quoting this book I think we should read it Deuteronomy um 1815. brother I think that I don't know if I gave you that scripture or not Deuteronomy 18 15. yeah right there it says this and the Lord thy God this is Moses speaking and the Lord thy God will raise up into thee a prophet from the midst of the of thy Brethren like unto me unto him ye shall hearken according to all that thou desirest of the Lord thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly saying let me not hear again the voice of the Lord my God neither let me see this great fire anymore that I die not do you remember that story they got scared and they said Lord don't don't you don't speak let Moses speak and the Lord said unto me they have well spoken that which they have spoken I will raise up a prophet from among their Brethren like unto thee and will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him and it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name I will require it of him so he's speaking of that scripture he's referencing as he's as he's preaching here he's referencing that scripture that that Moses had prophesied there and they were aware these Jews these studies learned individuals they were aware of that prophecy in fact they were so aware that when John the Baptist came they asked him they said hey John they said uh well they probably didn't say hey John they probably said John are you the Messiah and John said no and then they say this they said are you that prophet you know the scripture I'm talking about John are you that Prophet this is the scripture they're referring to because they knew that this man was going to come and they knew that this was going to be the Messiah they had tied that two together and here Stephen is bringing this out this is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in Mount Sinai and with our fathers who received the Lively oracles to give unto us to whom our fathers would not obey but thrust him from them and in their own Hearts turn back again into Egypt you remember I believe the Bible says murmuring is the word do you remember when they were going around for that 40 years and they're complaining and moaning and groaning and bellyaching and and doing all that saying oh why'd you bring us out here Moses you're just you brought us out here to kill us and we're sick of this manna that God is sending from Heaven every day you know we're sick of these Quail that come out that we asked for me we're just tired of this you know the story and here we are that they wanted to go back into Egypt and I can imagine probably right around this time the blood pressure starts to rise in these these priests because now I think that they might know which direction Stephen's going here sing unto Aaron hold on let me go back uh I don't want to miss this verse number 39 to whom our fathers would not obey but thrust him from them and in their own Hearts turn back again to Egypt now this this is this is very very important saying unto Aaron make us Gods to go before us for as for this Moses which brought us out of the land of Egypt we ought not what has become of him now you know this story so Moses goes up on the mountain and he doesn't come down for do you know how long very important number he's up there on the mountain for 40 days so they're they're saying oh he's gone he's dead or whatever so build us this calf and then they they just fall into sin and we look and look at that 40 days we go back to the very beginning of Jesus's Ministry so Moses is up there with God on the mountain and here comes Jesus I don't know what what is it let's see it's a about 1400 1500 years later Here Comes Jesus and he his ministry starts and he goes up into the mountain into the desert for how long 40 days very very good type and look at Stephen I guarantee you he knew this and here he is relating this this is so beautiful this is just this is so exciting saying unto Aaron make us uh make us Gods because we don't know where he went and they made a calf in those days and offered a sacrifice under the idol and rejoiced in the works of their own hands then God turned and gave them up to worship the host of Heaven as it is written in the book of the prophets oh ye House of Israel you have offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of 40 years in the wilderness yea ye took up the Tabernacle of moloch and the star of your God rinfin figures which ye made to worship them and I will carry you away Beyond Babylon now what he's doing we don't have time but he's referencing a prophecy by the by the prophet Amos our fathers had the Tabernacle of witness in the wilderness as he had appointed speaking unto Moses that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen which our fathers which which but our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus in the possession of the Gentiles whom God drave out before the face of our fathers unto the days of David who found favor before God and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of Jacob but Solomon built him a house now he had talked about Stephen had talked about Moses and he talked about the law now remember they he said they blaspheme he also blasphemed the temple now this I mean incredible minister this young man named Stephen now he's going to bring in the temple into this now you want to see their blood pressure really start to go up but Solomon built him a house how be it however the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet now remember brother Lau they think a lot of that Temple especially those guys called the Sadducees it's everything to them and here this man is actually quoting a prophet before him quoting I believe Solomon and he's saying listen he's saying that this Temple that you have God doesn't dwell in there now I know that that he's done all this and and he's been there but he said that he doesn't dwell in a temple made with hands I think we should read it first first Kings chapter eight verse 27. this is great this is Solomon dedicating the temple First Kings chapter 8 verse 27. but will God indeed dwell on Earth behold the heaven and Heaven of Heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house that I have builded speaking of the Temple so here is Stephen and he's taking this scripture and he's saying listen you are things so much of this Temple but the Bible says that he doesn't even dwell in a temple or this building made with hands Heaven is my throne and Earth is my footstool what house will ye build me saith the Lord or what is the place of my rest quoting another Prophet quoting Isaiah now 66 almost verbatim right there we don't have to go back and read it here he is quoting now Isaiah Heaven is my throne and Earth is my footstool what house will you build me saith the Lord or what is the place of my rest hath not my hand made all these things powerful Stephen is saying listen I brought you through history I've shown you no we're not blaspheming Moses we love Moses Moses was a prophet and and you look at this Temple this Temple ain't all that you know what the right Temple is is this Temple and he's he's going there and he's he's laying these things dude all the way up to Abraham and he even mentioned circumcision at the beginning he says this was a covenant with God and he's hitting all of the main points with these with these Pharisees and Sadducees and then Stephen shifts from first gear to fifth he hits warp speed you know how you know in Star Trek when when you know they're going along and and it does the thing in In Our Star Wars or whatever and all the stars just and he's just cooking down through there that's what Stephen does he said he goes from he goes from 25 miles an hour to 150. and he says this here's the blood pressure is gonna go up he just laid it out he just laid that foundation and he did it better than any of them could have done it a masterful sermon and he says this in verse 51 he says you stiff-neck he's quoting Moses again he says you stiff-neck and uncircumcised in the heart and ears you do always resist resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did so did so do ye stiff neck as I said was a term that Moses used in Exodus 32 and 33 and many other places Moses and God called the people stiff neck they knew it these Pharisees and Sadducees like what me stiff neck this Deacon Preacher Man he knows the word and he's quoting and now he's quoting with zeal and he's calling them uncircumcised how important brother Paul was circumcision to these Jews all the way back to Abraham and they said that is what separates us from the world is that we're circumcised that's what makes us better even so you had to if you wanted to marry into the into the Jewish Family you had to get circumcised you know that this is what this is what means everything to us and now you're saying I'm uncircumcised in the heart how dare you it's coming up and he says you resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did the tradition of the elders was in place for thousands of years and you're telling us that our fathers the oral tradition allow all of these Great Men of God that have come down that that we read everything that they've written and we study so hard you're saying that they resisted the Holy Ghost coming up he continues which of the prophets have your fathers not persecuted and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the just one of whom you have been now the betrayers and murders that just one he capitalizes here our brother Luke who wrote this he capitalizes it it's referring to the Lord Jesus and they knew it was referring to the Lord Jesus and they also knew what he was referring to you were against Moses you know you have in there Dayton and Cora and all these ones that withstood Moses you sought Isaiah in half you killed him you threw Jeremiah in prison you stoned Zachariah here's the their this blood pressure is running and there they know what happened in the past and they're saying and you Stephen you little squirt you're saying that we did the same to this man Jesus and you're you're comparing that to Zachariah being stoned you're comparing that to withstanding Moses he continues I am I love this this this sermon is so beautiful who have received the law by the dispensations of angels sorry my phone is talking to me who have received the law by the disposition of angels and have not kept it when they heard these things these people that he's preaching to when they heard these things they were cut to the heart and they gnashed on him with their teeth they were cut to the heart same I believe it's the same words as when they when they were they were torn in the heart something happened in their heart they were they were they became emotional about this and I believe it's the the same Greek word that I believe is is in the book of Acts chapter 2 when it says they were pricked in the heart these other ones that were pricked in the heart they were condemned it really meant something these over here they were offended how can you say this they were angry they were grinding their teeth upset but he being full of the Holy Ghost looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of God this as I was reading and studying this I got I got blessed in this whole chapter but I got I got blessed right here because in Colossians and I think in in at least one other place it says that Jesus is sitting at the right hand of God and here it says that he's standing I wonder I wonder if he That's my boy foreign do it up that's my son this man Stephen I Love Thinking of Jesus standing up that's him now look what happens oh that thought friends that thought I gotta stop for a second makes me want to cry thinking of Jesus sitting at the right hand of God that he might stand up for this young man Stephen welcome them into the kingdom Stephen looks up and said behold I see the heavens open and the son of man standing at the right hand of God and they cried with a loud voice and they stopped their ears and they ran upon him with one Accord look at the Spirit of Satan here hatred and vitriol and Malice and violence all present in those men and cast him out of the city and stoned him and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet whose name was Saul that's the other young man that I mentioned earlier this is the first time we see him and he was consenting to the death of this other young man named Stephen and they stoned Stephen and calling upon God and saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit look at the Spirit that's in Stephen The Same Spirit that was in the Lord Jesus when he said in Luke chapter 23 verse 46 he said father into thy hands I commend my spirit Stephen says here Lord Jesus receive my spirit look at the godhead look at the godhead sow when Jesus said father and Stephen said Jesus which one's God ah there's a saying Stephen says Lord Jesus receive my spirit so who is receiving that spirit of this brother Stephen he looked up Lord receive me the musicians if you'd come and I'll close and here is Stephen and he kneeled down and he cried with a loud voice saying this Lord look at the Spirit that's in him this is the same Spirit of this man that was just crucified on that cross remember they had received this Holy Spirit at the day of Pentecost and this man Stephen we see that he was filled with the spirit as you said he was a great young man and he kneeled down and he cried with a loud voice Lord lay not this sin to their charge murdering him in the very Act of dying in the very Act of losing his life Jesus was in the very Act of the breath going out of him the life going out of him had his had his hands nailed to the cross Jesus said does it sound similar Jesus said father forgive them for they know not what they do Stephen says Lord lay not the sin to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep how beautiful what a testimony brother Aaron if you could come and Lead songs what a testimony I'll tell you what I've been studying this this chapter thinking of this man Stephen the boldness remember brother Lyle they prayed they prayed for boldness and here it is right here brother Stephen he had that boldness went up before them preached this masterful wonderful sermon [Music] brought it all the way back to Abraham and Moses Joseph and all of them and he showed him he said look this is what happened in history [Music] all the way through and you've done it every single time just like your fathers have they hated him for telling the truth and yet Stephen I mean it wasn't a pushover he said you uncircumcised in our nearest he wasn't he wasn't gonna roll over and just take it he was going to give him a chance have her right there right there but then when it came in the end everything our brother Stephen said was absolutely the word of God as as it's recorded here in the book of Acts and when it came right down to it I love it he said father [Music] don't lay this into their charge showing the very Spirit of Christ amen don't you love the book of Acts it just just that one chapter gave us the whole plan salvation gave us a perfect
