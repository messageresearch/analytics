never be able to catch him i said brother mike you'll be the same age you'll be running right with him don't don't you worry about it so appreciate the grace of god in our lives and all that he's done he's so good to us amen he was wounded for all you realize what he did for you he took the beating you're bruising everything you deserved he said lay it on me father i'll take it for them and you said oh but you don't know what i go through you don't know my thoughts no as we heard from brother dennis mcgeary and brother reggie reminded us he knows he knows because he took it upon himself he was tempted in every manner that you and i could be tempted as hard as that is to imagine but he took upon himself a body of flesh so that when you said father he says i understand and i can be touched by the feeling of your infirmities so i appreciate the grace of god we do have some requests [Music] and uh from sister amelia she says a woman my building named esperanza is asking prayer for her son daniel is going to and to have some type of surgery he's 19 years old also for salvation and i would say salvation first because you'd be healed today sick tomorrow but that seed of god in you is eternal to recognize that brother jeremy baggett asked us to remember our sister karen pruitt in prayer i believe that's brother tim pruitt's wife so we'll do that my niece michelle lujan who we've been praying for [Music] she sent this this morning says i know the church has been praying for me and i am grateful and thankful for all the prayers i'm doing so much better sleeping through the entire night now pain has lessened greatly and is more manageable but she says please continue to pray for a complete healing show we'll do that because he's a healer if you'll stand with me sister amelia wanted also to give a praise he said i went i went for the test results of the echo graham everything is good no heart problems so amen praise god for that but beyond a physical heart problem i want my heart to be right before him above all things so you have a need say lord you know my need i can't even put it in the right words you better understand it and i could say lord we we come to you knowing they're in isaiah lord in 53 isaiah riding hundreds of years before that you were going to be wounded you were going to be bruised you were going to be chastised all the way to a cross all the way to death and laid in a tomb and even go down into the pits of hell to take back the keys of death in hell and rip them back to the right owner lord for one had come in and he took those keys he stole them lord but you were aware of it you said i'm going i'm gonna i'm gonna make this right lord and this morning you've seen every hand raised you've seen every heart that's represented here you've heard this request and you've met them already lord and we appreciate that for our god's reigns he's alive lord you're the same yesterday today and forever and we thank you for the lord in jesus christ's name amen good to love the lord you may be seated i know the storm went through yesterday and hit parts of town pretty hard and they called my son-in-law amos out in the middle of the storm to go out and do repairs and things so we were praying for him the lord would keep him safe and even all of those that would have to respond the medical and and the safety and all things that we take for granted until we need it but let's remember all those who literally will go out and put their life in danger for us so appreciate that so this morning if you had the whatsapp announcement you saw it brother matt watkins is with us this morning we had a chance to talk with him recently and just he had called me and said i could come out minister if if he so desired so we had if the lord led him to come that way would be all right so it worked out and contacted me on thursday and said we're going to try to come this weekend but then that hurricane was coming through and then there was no contact for a day and a half until he finally said i'm sorry he said we're running around trying to get everybody's generators hooked up getting prepared for the storm just doing that he said and then the storm missed them so but it's better to be prepared and not have to deal with it than have to deal with it not being prepared so and then he said um we'll be coming out got my ticket and all then he sent me a text late afternoon he said we're on an airplane circle in atlanta because we can't land because of the storm pray that the tucson flight doesn't get cancelled so we spread it around quickly about 15 minutes later he said the flight has landed and the flight hasn't canceled so i'll be there and he said a clean flight all the way over here got in here kind of late so this morning brother matt is with us and but beyond brother matt with us of the lord jesus who keeps his word and never fails here so phil stand with me we want to give him the time that's needed and god answers prayer god still meets god still moves he's the same yesterday today and forever so amen amazing grace how many knows it's god's grace talking with brother arne a little bit before service here talking about some of the situations that are going on in this world today god knows about it nothing surprises him but he's allowed it he's allowed it to be satan think he has the upper hand but he can only go as far as god lets him and i said when you think about it brother branham on the other side he says when you get there you'll hear me singing amazing grace why because it'll always be amazing grace even when we're on the other side you're not going to be able to walk up you're not going to want to walk him said i'm here i deserve it lord you're going to want to bow and worship and

playing that for me because you say why brother matt because grace saved me and as the song says i was rich i was blind i couldn't see but but praise god now i can and then it was grace that put something in my heart to say i want to serve you lord i want to give you my whole heart man couldn't do that but god put something in my heart a desire to serve him but that was amazing grace but then after i started serving him i've made many mistakes i've messed up a lot of times many times in my life i look back and say lord i've just been so unfaithful to you but you know what still keeps me the grace of god and i say lord your grace just gets more amazing amen praise the lord god bless you joel chapter one if you have your bible it's so good to be here with you and see all your faces amen many of you who we've not seen for a number of months now amen how you doing that's what i would ask you but i already know the answer to that you know why because we've received a message shalom so it doesn't matter what's happening around us doesn't matter what's happening in the world or in our own ecosphere we've received a message of shalom peace bride all is well amen i'm thankful for that amen message to my heart amen to your heart god's been good to us that would be my testimony amen of my life god has been good amen praise god we want to just got something upon our heart we'd like to turn to the word this morning amen joel chapter one amen that'll be all the music thank you amen god bless you joel chapter one and we look we'd like to just take a message here today that the lord just so has inspired me uh personally the lord's already and i'm i'm preaching this from a a different perspective amen that i that maybe i had even when the lord gave me this because i ministered this one time and i just committed something to the lord and i've watched the hand of god in my personal life just come and fulfill his word that's an awesome thing when you see that amen i'm speaking to you today on something the lord has placed upon my heart i would like to title restoring years restoring years and i'm going to speak this this morning and we won't cover it all we'll get to it if you want to hear i'll leave you on a cliffhanger so that you got to come back tonight to hear the rest but uh if you got amen just a need before the lord something upon your heart you just want to raise that to the lord and say lord would you come and remember my need amen this morning god sees those hands amen we're going to pray here in a moment for those needs i'd like to just minister to you today and just it's very heavy upon my heart so if i seem to just jump right in uh just understand the lord even on the the days coming and then all through the night last night up early this morning i just felt a burden just a weight just drop down upon my spirit and i just just begin to weep there and pray before the lord and so i just have a desire upon my heart that i could just get out of the way and that the lord jesus could come and minister to you and your needs and your family in your home so just be sensitive to what the lord would say to you today amen came with just the burden of the lord upon my heart and i know that jesus is here amen and he has an eternal purpose and desire in our lives amen praise the lord joel chapter 1 and we're just going to read some verses here and then we'll read verse 2 of chapter 2. hear this verse 2. hear this you old men and give ear all you inhabitants of the land has this been in our in your days or even in the days of your fathers tell you your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children another generation that which the palmer worm hath left hath the locust eaten and that which the locust has left has the cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten verse seven he hath laid my vine waste and barked my fig tree he hath made it clean bare and casted away the branches thereof are made white lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth the meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the lord the priest the lord's ministers mourn the field is wasted the land mourneth for the corn is wasted the new wine is dried up the oil languisheth be you ashamed o you husband men how all you vine dressers for the wheat and for the barley because the harvest of the field is perished the vine is dried up and the fig tree languisheth the pomegranate tree the palm tree also and the apple tree even all the trees of the field are withered because joy is withered away from the sons of men gird yourselves and lament you priests how you ministers of the altar come lie all night and sackcloth you ministers of my god for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholding from the house of your god sanctify you a fast call a solemn assembly gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land and to the house of the lord your god and cry unto the lord alas for the day for the day of the lord is at hand and as a destruction from the almighty shall it come is not the meat cut off before our eyes yea joy and gladness from the house of god the seed is rotten under their clods the garners are laid desolate the barns are broken down the corn is withered how do the beasts groan the herds of cattle are perplexed because they have no pasture yea the flocks of the sheep are made desolate oh lord to thee will i cry for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field the beast of the filled cry also unto thee for the rivers of water are dried up and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness sad tragic reality of the nation of israel i want you to read here and look at chapter 2 and i want you just to begin we're just going to begin reading verse 25 i'm sorry verse 23 be you glad you children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god how many can rejoice this morning for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of wheat and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil and i will restore to you the years that the locusts hath eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and it shall come to pass let's just read verse 28 it shall come to pass afterward that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh now here's a promise and also a prophecy and all your and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days in those days will i pour out my spirit amen let's just pray heavenly father lord we feel your quickening power lord as we just read your word father for truly it's within this word that all the resource for everything that we need in life is found it's not found in a broken cistern of hollywood it's not found in the broken cisterns of political systems and socialized lord social ideas and cultures that the world has created trying to find answers lord but the resource the wellspring of all living water comes from your word lord and we just raise our hands this morning in unison in unity as one body and say lord would you come and speak lord and would your spirit pour out upon all flesh this morning may it be rich may it be full may it be exactly what we need as we surrender now to you in the name of jesus christ we pray and the church said amen you can have your seats this morning i don't know how far we'll get to i'm just going to be obedient to the lord amen and if i had been a few months since i get here then i could make up and we could have a couple overtimes right amen well we'll try to we'll try not to do that try to get just what the lord amen wants us to stay and then we'll we'll stop amen the scripture here and we're just going to just go through some of this slowly as we just just see what the lord would have us cover but joe comes 10 years and we don't want to take too much time to get into the the setting of the history but it's very important so that you understand exactly what his word would mean and what his burden was the prophet joel speaks to this southern tribe pre-exiled joel comes to the the house of judah the southern kingdom and he he's living in this time of king uzziah and when you think of king uzziah in the bible you remember the scripture of isaiah when isaiah says the year that the king uzziah died i saw the lord seated on a throne high and lifted up high and exalted in other words the human kingdom of uzziah had died and now god was going to usher in the new king the risen the the the jehovah the real king and so but this time of uzziah that joel is going to prophesy in it's a great time of great plenty the bible would call it a year of fatness and when you see that in the bible it means a year of great success great prosperity they didn't want for much and it's very amazing what you read in joel 1 because you see that a plague has fallen and locusts have came and they've devoured and destroyed but prior to that curse that god sends is a time of great prosperity it's a time where there's great progress and almost on every aspect in israel monetarily financially militarily administratively commercially economically there was a time of flourishment and and it's it's even said of king uzziah in second chronicles that his fame spread as far as the border of egypt because he had became very powerful it speaks and says that second only to solomon was this great time this golden year you would call it this golden age that the children of israel are living in under king uzziah great prosperity and and he begins to contrast that in chapter one when he says the vats are broken and and and all the all the field languisheth and there's no field for the no pasture for the cattle but he's contrasting that but prior to the plague it was a time of great success time of great prosperity where their vats were overflowing but it's amazing because he's joel is not going to come to speak to the natural condition or to address the natural uh uh a burden that's not what's upon his heart because most of the time when god comes and he anoints a vessel and he begins to use that vessel to minister to his people god has a message on his heart it's not the man or the prophet that has a message upon his heart but god has baptized that prophet with his own personal burden and that man then becomes the instrument he becomes the oracle for god the mouth of god and the words of god to begin to speak the mind of god and so a prophet doesn't come with his own message he's a eunuch he has no seed of his own he has no thought of his own but he becomes a tool and an instrument to translate and to become a conduit to send the heart and the burden of god and so he begins to display joel begins to minister and he begins to speak of the burden of the lord is not upon their natural condition but it's actually their spiritual condition you see to god your spiritual condition is actually all that matters now i know your health is important and god says i desire that you be in health and that you prosper and god's concerned that you live a life with joy he didn't save you to be miserable he didn't save you to be down and do me and gloomy he saved you to be a joy unspeakable and full of glory and we should have the joy and the happiness of god but let me just come to you just here for a moment and tell you that god is more concerned mostly with your spiritual health than any other aspect of your life and if you're a child of god a seed of god whether you're today where you should be or maybe you're born by the spirit of god or or you're you're you haven't came to a new birth here this morning let me just say that god's interest in you god's purpose for you god's plans for you and your life is a spiritual plan not a natural plan amen am i i have to amend my own preaching today but that's all right god's plan for you is a spiritual plan he has a spiritual burden he has a something upon his mind he wants you to prosper and be in health and be happy but ultimately as the prophet of god said i would rather eat soda water branch water and drink soda crackers but have the spirit of god in my soul that have all the riches of the world you see to god your spiritual condition and where you're at spiritually is really all that matters to god our physical life our emotional life is important but ultimately it's our spiritual condition that god is the most concerned with in so much that if god has to break your physical condition to fix your spiritual condition then god is a kind loving heavenly father and if he has to break your health if he has to break your bank if he has to destroy your home physically then god knows what's best to get your attention and i'm so glad that he does you see he's a heavenly father he's a heavenly father and his interest is in his children as the prophet of god says and i hear the words of brother branham when he begins to talk about a mother and he says that mother's love that loves that child so much and he says but if it's a real true love he said if that mother really truly loves that soul of that baby that soul of that child he says then that mother no matter how much it might hurt the feelings of that child or might hurt her own feelings he says when that mother sees that child and it starts to it starts to go in air and it and it goes and he says that that mother starts to see that child he says uh make a mistake and it needs discipline he says then that mother no matter how much it hurts her he says she'll spank that child if she's got a real mother's love now not out of cruelty not out of some maniacal way but out of real true love as jesus says as many as i love i rebuke and chasten i chastise and the prophet of god says no matter how much it hurts her to spank that child she doesn't enjoy that it's not a moment that she enjoys her father enjoys but he said if you really truly love them even if it hurts your feelings you will correct the error of that child because why because why brother matt why do we bring correction to our child now you're you you have the human love and the natural love of a mother and father how much more does our heavenly father who has a natural not a natural love but a heavenly love not a human love but an agape love how much more if he sees one of his children going the wrong way that god will bring a rod of correction to try to correct the error of your life as brother adam says it's it's the real true love why do we bring correction to that child oh it's not a big deal you know just let it go a big deal it really doesn't matter no a real true love you say why do we why do we why do we discipline why do we spank our children why do we bring correction in their life it's because their ultimate condition what they're going to be in life is more important to a mother and a father it's more important to you what they are becoming rather than what they are right now can you say amen to the word this morning it's more important to you not what they are now i'm getting somewhere so just stick with me here it's not so important what you see right now or what's happening right now but what they're going to be oh let me just preach here for a moment my brother and my sister i'm so glad i got a heavenly father and i could say god cares more about what he's bringing me to than where i'm at right now and god puts more emphasis on the vision and the plan he has for me in the future than what he sees right now god cares more about where you're going to be than where you are currently and maybe you don't understand you could say this morning i don't understand what's happening in my life and i don't understand what's happening often times he's using what's happening now to prepare you for what's coming down the road what you can't see is around the corner god is using right now current circumstances and trials and tribulations and discipline in your life he's concerned about what's around the corner so he'll bring certain things in your life to prepare you for that moment are you with me this morning sometimes we question and say lord why is this happening and i just don't understand and why are certain things that seem out of place in my life and certain things seem mixed up and disjointed and the pieces don't all fit and they seem out of joint and things seem so messed up but just remember god never really looks at the current condition but he looks at what you're going to be and his motivation and how he works is his plan so what does that mean brother matt that means that god never gets discouraged by your failures right now god never gets discouraged by the condition of you right now because he's already seen a picture of what he's bringing you to be god never gets discouraged by your he never gets discouraged by how low you might seem so let me say this so we shouldn't get discouraged by our current conditions don't ever let your current circumstance discourage you but always say lord i believe no matter what i see right now you're bringing me to something oh let me go a step further than that don't look at your current conditions of your children and where they're at right now and maybe all you see in your marriage and in your home and in your health and all you see is you're you're flooded by the discouragement of right now but say lord i'm not gonna get bogged down upon what i see right now i'm going to believe you're bringing me to something you've got a plan for my life you've got a purpose for me god and i say this morning bring me to that purpose oh lord bring me to what you've envisioned for my life the blueprint that you've laid out i believe you're bringing me to something you've got a vision for my life so whatever my oh i just say take joy this morning no matter what it looks like in your circumstance you could say lord i believe you've got a vision and a purpose and a plan for my life so whatever my life looks like right now it's only proof that you're working on something in me joel mentions this and he says in chapter one there so what what happens prior to this plague their vine is flourishing their vats were overflowing the fig trees and the pomegranate trees and apples and all the fruits were loading down their land was fertile barns were filled to the brim olive oil was flowing like a river everything just seems so good so good it's amazing how we categorize good it's amazing how we look at life and say oh life is just good win when i have this and this and this and this and when i'm here at this place and here over here and this is happening oh life is just good and then when god comes and he messes all that up we just oh we're just oh life is so terrible oh it's just oh can we just go back to you know to pre-covet as if life was somehow good pre-covered let me tell you something friends the world was falling apart pre-coveted oh it's so good the cattle never fell the herds were multiplying the plot the flocks were plentiful everything on the outside from the outside the veneer was perfect it was in place had all the things that looked just so crisp and so clean and so manicured and fruit was flowing and the oil was flowing the cattle were feeding the herds were multiplying the flocks were plentiful and everything on the outside just looked so just perfect but god says but i see beyond the shell of outward veneer i see beyond the shell of religiosity i see beyond the shell of what your human exterior looks like and i look into the heart and god says now let's look at the spiritual condition what does notice this here let's look at the spiritual condition because what does oftentimes what does material prosperity bring i'm not just talking about money you got the nicest house or the nicest cards or the greatest things in the world your everyone defines uh the level of prosperity differently in different classes and and but but life this is uh this is all about just a good time it's a good time in life where there's no trouble no stress no worry and and but but let me just say this friends what does oftentimes material goodness bring if we would all just for a moment put down our take them off take off those angel wings just for a moment take that halo and sit it down here for a second can i just preach to you on a on a real level we could lose all of our masks here this morning's putting on our angel wings i know y'all drove this morning on a chair and a chariot i did literally they they decided to give me a mustang i guess they think every young guy wants a sports car and so i go out to get my car and it's a mustang i thought oh and i got to drive this to church on sunday morning so i parked over there on the side where no one can see me let's put down our angel wings for a minute what does natural success oftentimes bring if we'd all be honest here before god and ourself the best natural circumstance times of peace times of fatness and plenty oftentimes leads to great spiritual poverty and for some eventual spiritual death moses warned of this in deuteronomy 6 you can put that up if you want i'm going to read it deuteronomy 6 verse 10 and it shall be when notice this here and it shall be when the lord your god shall have brought you let me make sure i didn't miss this here this morning no he says and it shall be when the lord your god shall have brought thee into the land which he swore unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob to give the great and goodly cities notice this which thou buildest not important asterisk there and and houses verse 11 full of good things which thou fill us not and wells digged which thou diggest not vineyards and olive trees which thou plantest not when thou shall have eaten and be full then then very important then beware no no don't stop reading for a minute don't read ahead of me now hold on when you get over there and your land is full of plenty notice what moses begins to say here and he says it shall be when the lord has brought you up and he takes you into canaan he takes you into that land which you swore unto your fathers to give it to them and he says he'll give you great goodly cities which thou built us not you didn't labor you didn't sweat you didn't toil there was no work into it house is full of good things wells dig which thou diggest not they didn't have well drills in those days so it was laborsome to drill and to dig and to toil and to sweat and to give of yourself which thou plantest not vineyards and olive trees when thou shall have eaten and be full then then then beware he says in verse 12 here's a warning lest thou forget the lord lest thou forget the lord how how brother and preaches a message remembering the lord it's amazing how the carnal nature as even moses says that you get over there and you've got everything and you'd you just thank god forever of the goodness and the greatness and all that he's done moses says but beware lest you forget the lord which brought thee forth out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage when you come into the land you're going to find houses you didn't build and they're going to be full of good things i'm going to give you plenty things that you that you didn't build you didn't do this god did it wells that you can drink from of water that you didn't dig there's no labor involved there was no stress there was no sweat when you work for something you can appreciate it you know what it means to have it because you gained it because you've done it and it'll be precious to you it'll be important to you it means something to you so this is the warning from god when god gives you something like the holy ghost which is a gift from god and it gives you something or a salvation a free gift and you don't earn it it's given to you you didn't build it you didn't earn it you didn't sweat over it but it gives you good things and listen to me my brother god fills our homes our hearts our vessels with good things oh we've got a lot of good things you've got a lot to be thankful for today as a son or daughter of god you ought to raise your hands and just say lord thank you for all the good things that you've done in my life i'm blessed beyond measure like i'm blessed beyond measure i've been blessed as the song says of a roof up above me and shoes on my feet food at my table uh children who uh in a home uh love in my family and harmony and then more and above all of the all of the natural things i want to say lord thank you that you put a desire in my heart to serve you to want you to to worship you thank you that you changed me when i couldn't change myself he gives you good things so moses says be careful beware lest thou forget the lord lest thou get there and forget the freedom that he's brought for you this is exactly what happens to israel in a great time of prosperity they forgot the lord so you know what god did you know what god does god sends a plague i had a video i don't want to show it today it just would take too much time but it's just a modern day locust outbreak and if you could see the video of the swarms of locusts and they hatch overnight and there's hundreds of thousands of of large grasshoppers and they just go and they they in in one day they travel i forget how many hundreds of miles and in their path they leave nothing they they eat all of the crops they don't just eat the fruit they eat the stalk they eat all the way to the roots in the ground when the locust is finished it's just barren and dry and dust there's nothing left and so god they forget the lord and so god sends a plague of locusts he sends them this this plague and let me just say to you is it to punish them is it is it to pick on them is god doing that is he sending they they have a time of planning and god sends this drought he sends the locust and you say is is god doing it some maniacal uh god and he's just trying to get revenge on them you know it's so important how you view what god is doing in your life it is so important on how you view your trials and your tests and your tribulations because if you look at what god is doing to some punishment or spewing out anger then you've missed the character of god and you've misunderstood why god has you in a hard time in your life let me just say this to you today the satan would love to misconstrue what's happened to you and say god doesn't love you god's just doing that he's angry and he's pouring out his anger and you've just send your day of grace away and now you're just forever going to be uh and listen to me friend satan would love to make you misunderstand that it wasn't revenge it wasn't that at all why does he send a plague of locusts is it because he's cruel no he doesn't because he's going to the most important aspect of their life and let me just say god always has a good reason i'm just going to stop and slow down for a moment god always has a good reason i don't understand the reason you can't make sense of that god always has a good reason you say how do you know that brother matt because he's a good father he's a good good father that's what he is he's a good god he's a good father and whatever he brings in your life whatever it is it's for your benefit listen to what brother branham says here and this is just i want you to hear this if they have the powerpoint there you can just display if they need to turn the lights and dim them that's perfectly fine brother jordan i think you said that i want i want them to see i've got a lot to display so turn it down as low as you want amen want to make sure you can see these seems like it's a little still a little hard to know they're having trouble out of the projector there can you see that there in the back you see that there brother adam says in leadership he says oh god let me go lord don't leave me behind jesus let me go with you father i don't want to stay here on this earth to watch these tribulations coming on i say lord i don't want to stay here on this earth how many can identify with the prophet this morning and say lord i don't want to stay here he says god let me don't leave me behind jesus i want the lord to see my hand this morning don't don't leave me behind lord jesus let me go with you father i don't want to stay here on this earth to watch these tribulations coming on i don't want to stay here in the this insanity i don't want to stand here when hideous sights the people losing their minds he says we look at man trying to act like beasts and look like beasts and the women trying to look like animals with the paints on their face knowing that these things are predicted to happen that the thing will they'll go notice they'll go insane to locust will raise up with hair like women to haunt the women and teeth like lions and things that you've said the mental can listen listen friends you you think you think covet was bad you think that was a plague go read revelations 9 you'll get a revelation of what a plague is let me just say that was nothing just a little kick up and that one little hiccup has wrecked havoc wreaked havoc on the entire world and it was nothing when brother adam says with hair like women to haunt the women and teeth like lions and things that you've said the mental condition of the people will be completely gone if you think the world is insane today wait till the bride is out of here and the bible says he that whom that letteth will let until he be taken out of the way you know who that he that that he that be taken out of the way that's you that's the remnant that's the elected and when when they're taken out of the way judgment that spewing anger of god pours like a cauldron over the entire world i say lord don't let me be here don't leave me behind lord take me with you lord and he says of the people will be completely gone we see it in the making right now lord help us restore to us the same mind oh i just will give you the opportunity to raise your hand and say like a prayer restore to us the same mind of christ jesus our lord i say like brother branham don't leave me here let me go with you father don't let me be here to experience that you know what that's for my brother my sister why is the tribulation for brother branham says it's a purging because they've rejected christ the word he says it's a purging it purges all of the world it purges everything out and you know what brother adam says the holy ghost is given for to purge you so you know what i say this morning i say don't let me experience that purge so purge me now lord let me go through the purge right now if there be anything unlike you i'll let the holy spirit purge me of anything that's unlike your word this morning lord notice here he says he warns them and he says this in joe 2 and he says you're no no notice what's happening i'll just mute that just for a moment actually brother jeremy if you could bring up joel 2 and just pause that for a minute notice what he says here this is a time of great plenty and a progress and prosperity but there's spiritual conditions so god sends a plague and he wipes everything out and now the vats are empty and broken in the fields as we read in joel 1 there's nothing left and it just looks like total barrenness and then god begins to say but i i want to bring a promise you see what's waiting i hope you catch this today what's waiting on the other side of the plague what's waiting on the other side of the barrenness what's waiting just on the or on the other side it's a god who has a heart to restore a god who has a heart to give back a heart to a god that says i want to wash you i want to clean you i want to give you something i want to fill you that's what i want but in order to get there you got to first repent you got to first turn away notice what he says here in joe 2 verse 12 brother jeremy if you have that therefore also now saith the lord turn you even to me with all your heart oh i just asked myself this morning read that just read that felt the anointing of god drop upon my soul and i said lord i want i want to turn my whole heart if i have it lord i want to make sure that all of me that 100 of me has turned to you lord turn with your whole heart have we done that have you done that have you turned with all that's within you and with fasting and with weeping and with mourning oh you think fasting no that doesn't matter the morning doesn't it's just whatever you pray and what you confess with your mouth and believe with your heart listen to me friends it's important to god with fasting and with weapon and with mourning and rend verse 13 and rend versus the next verse there brother jeremy and rind that means to rip that means to tear your heart not your garments not your garment notice what he says rip your heart don't tell your garment that's what they would do in the old testament the prophets would take their garment and they would just rip it open they'd take sackcloth and ashes they'd wear they'd wear sackcloth that was like a almost like burlap that was itchy goat's hair and and all kinds of things that would itch them and they would take this goats they would take this sackcloth and they would pour it over or to wear it then they'd take the ashes and they'd dump it all on their head and they'd go if i forgot how many days they'd walk through israel bearing the repentance and the burden asking god forgive us lord we're a wicked and stubborn people the people as wicked and stubborn so that prophet trying to intercede on behalf of those people he would wear that sackcloth and ashes and say god hold your wrath lord don't forget these are your people i know what you see right now lord i know what it looks like right now but don't forget this is your people this is your purchase lord and they would wear that sackcloth in that ashes but notice what he says here to the people turn to me with your whole heart rend rip tear your heart not your garment god's saying don't just come to me with an outward emotion and outward tears those are fine and those are good but make sure with those tears you're rending your heart oh let me just say this morning tucson tabernacle what we need is less external conformity and more internal change and transformation to say god change me i'll do a work that i can't do i don't want to conform to some dress code or some rule book but i want you to change my heart lord change the desire change my nature oh that's a real that's a real experience of the holy ghost when god just doesn't give you some law book that you live by but let me just tell you young people god can transform you down on the inside where you don't desire the things of the world anymore you don't thirst for those things anymore you thirst for a newness and a new life and a righteousness that's not yours god changes you from the inside he says rend your heart we're in your heart say lord i'm tired of going in the same direction i'm tired i want to turn to you with my whole heart for he i love this for he hears god he's not a wicked evil god waiting up there ready to knock you down but notice what he says for he is gracious and merciful he is gracious and merciful oh i'd throw down that idea that that that uh whatever religious idea you had of god and that identity of how you imagine him let the word reveal to him who he is let it let it reveal to you and tell you no matter what you've thought about god he's merciful he's gracious he's long-suffering he desires you he's here for you he wants you he's for you he's not there to hurt you he's not there to harm you he's there to save you john 3 16 but look at verse 17 for he he didn't come to condemn the world but that through him the world might be saved turn to the lord your god for he is gracious and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repenteth him of the evil who knoweth look at verse 14 who knoweth if he will return and repent and leave a blessing behind him even a meat offering in the drink offered into the lord your god blow the trumpet and zion sanctify a fast call of solemn assembly gather notice this gather the people you think gathering in the congregation isn't important we get all this stream let us all be virtual i hope this is okay to preach oh i'll just stream i'll just be virtual let me tell you something friends that the marriage supper of the lamb won't be live streamed you're gonna have to be there you won't watch it on a video you won't be virtually connected you got to be there in person amen gather the people you think it's all you think god doesn't think gatherings important no what does hebrews 10 say don't forsake the assembling the gathering uh don't forsake the assembling of yourselves together [Music] that much more as you see the day approaching copenhagen separated and disconnected a lot of people let me just say this don't be any more disconnected than you need to be because satan wants to come and put a wedge but god says gather gather it's important assemble the elders gather the children and those that suck the breasts let the bridegroom go forth thermos of his chamber and the bride out of her clothes and let the priests and the ministers of the lord weep before the porch and the altar let them say spare thy people o lord and give not that heritage to reproach that the heathen should rule over them wherefore should they say among the people where is their god what's god trying to do he's trying to sow his word it's what he's trying to do today that's what he that's why he called me that's why he put this burden upon my heart you know i don't get to choose what i preach i wish so bad i could come back there and say lord i this is what i'd like to say oh i just like to come up there with a big old smile lord and just tell them how good they are and i just love to come and bring joy and them just to eat from the bounty and the blessings of god everyone could just cry and weep and i was so bad i could choose that but you know what i don't get to choose what i preach because i'm a servant and i'm duty-bound i'm duty-bound to just become a conduit and let the lord jesus speak to your heart is he speaking to your heart this morning he's trying to sow his word into their heart you know what the reaction this is so powerful so not not powerful in the sense of of great but just amazing to me you know what the reaction the reply to this sermon was you preach this the day of the lord is coming so repent repent rend your heart don't tear your garment rinse your heart turn to the lord you know what the reaction to joel's call to repentance was for most of them instead of repenting they got drunk they got drunk they went into a stupor that's that was literally go read it go read the reaction the reaction of god's people after job's sermon was not a heart for most wasn't a heart of contrition and repentance it was more intoxication more drunkenness let me just say here this morning people every person has two different reactions to coming judgment and disaster some prepare and repent some just get drunk and they drink more they become more intoxicated and more intoxicated listen to what brother branham says here in the sudden secret going away of the church you with me i still got you he says let's just look at them if you have that brother jeremy you can put that back up he says this here and own the night let me just advance it on the night he's speaking of pearl harbor and he says just before the great attack the next morning there was a great dance or a great big party given in pearl harbor itself and no matter how much they tried to say that the japs were coming they still would not take the warning let's just look on them for a few minutes there's a little radio bulletin goes out a little piece in the corner of the paper about like a healing campaign would be advertised just a small place that the japs were on their road in the waters of the sea a great fleet notice this here a great fleet chapter on the road a great fleet was headed that way nonsense says the others we don't believe in no such a stuff as that what are you trying to scare us about then we find getting close to the night i can see at the home place instead of them preparing to get out of the city why the young girls were all putting on their new frocks and so forth they were just going down to this great big jubilee they were going to have imagine this is pearl harbor it's right before the bombs the japanese are going to come and they've sounded the warning they're on the radar they're coming and he says and also the officers of the army were just busy riding little passes so that the soldiers could all attend this party big drunken party and all the trucks were roaring and humming bringing their best of beer and their wine and stuff for this party and all the time the japanese fleet on its road there and they fell to hear the warning and as the sun began to set and they all gathered in this great tavern of a place maybe on the side somewhere the bartender polishing the bar or something said something like this say did you hear the rumor no i don't believe i did said the man he spoke to oh they say something about a japanese fleet be coming this way and then someone else drops in on the conversation a young silly girl bounces up there sticks her foot up on the bar said you gloomy-headed warts don't you know that we're here for to have a good time and not talk about war oh if that isn't just about the way the world is saying today about the coming of the lord you old fashioned foggy back numbers what makes you dress and act and do the way you do brother adam says but we're looking for that secret sudden appearing of the lord i say lord i'm looking for that secret sudden appearing of the lord for there's something in the air there's something in the air oh lord help me to preach this this morning there's something in the air a message of the holy spirit that tells us that the coming is it hand oh i say to you i preached to you from all of my heart this morning there's something in the air my brother and my sister let me just be a bra a newsman a broadcaster this morning to tell you there's something in the air there's something taking place and it isn't just here in tucson it's across the whole world god is shaking and awakening his family and his people this could be your last call to repentance i say god let me be ready i say like brother branham says don't leave me behind let me wash my garment let me make sure my calling and election is sure let me remove all the leaven from my home oh if you feel that way just raise a hand and identify say lord i'm praying not this morning there's something in the air there's a feeling and i'm looking i got an expectation i'm looking to the eastern sky lord lift your head up your redemption drawleth nigh there's something taking place something happening i felt that as i was flying here today holy spirit just dropped in on my heart and said warn tell the people broadcast it proclaim it something's taken place there's a feeling in the air there's something happening forget what it looks like right now look to what god is about to do says there's something in the air a message of the holy spirit that tells us the coming is at hand then when the big shindig went on no it must have been a horrible thing that night for said that sometime during the night they took a young lady a beautiful built young girl stripped her clothes from her put her in a little wagon just went underneath garmental runner down the street and so forth just having a big time and all the time all this frolicking and play and drunkenness and stupor what do they do they just kept drinking just keep drinking just give me another one just give me another one it's giving you that's what people do in the world the world's falling apart and they just say just give me another dose of hollywood give me another dose of entertainment let me take another vacation i'm sure to wash all my sorrows away i'm sure everything will be okay just let me get a little bit more drunk let me and and rap and engross myself more in my business more in my natural life more in what's happening right now just push it all out don't listen to those sounds don't listen to the warning see they'll either act one or two ways you'll get more drunk or you'll ring your heart he says all the while all the time the japanese was gaining grounds coming right on the next morning when the men on the post of duty and he says and then the next morning when the men on the post of duty and the airplane signal watching and so forth had been out all night drunk running around with these women and so forth was so drowsy and upset the next morning from the big party until they were caught asleep on the job and i'm afraid that it's going to be likewise at the coming of the lord the church the church do you hear the warning not the world not the drug addict that god listen to me friends but jesus said i would rather you be the drug addict i'd rather you be the drunkard on the bar stool do you realize that's what jesus warned this age of and said i'd rather you be cold because that sinner knows he needs a god and god can contact him for repentance i'd rather you be that or on fire than to be in church and get just enough of the message of the prophet of god sent a prophet of there's a message of the hour he'd rather just give you just a little listen to me friends satan is much more interested in corrupting the truth then removing the truth he's much more interested in giving you just a little dose of religion and belief and truth to make you cold and indifferent and carnal and you devalue what god's done he'd rather you be there than drunken on a bar stool somewhere do you realize satan loves religion he loves it brother adam says he hides behind it he says i'm so afraid that it's going to be likewise of the coming of the lord the church is so took up and drunken with the cares of the world till they're going to be asleep at the coming at the post of duty at the coming of the lord he says i'm so afraid so drunken with the cares of the world he preaches notice this repent repent turn with your whole heart rend your heart don't don't get more drunk don't just keep on listen to me friend i don't care what happens i don't care what happens tomorrow or the uncertainty of today don't look at those external things satan would love to get you so distracted with the things that are happening around you that you miss what god's trying to do right now because there's there's something happening there's something in the air there's something moving and it doesn't depend upon a preacher it doesn't depend upon a personality that's it's not going to take a preacher or personality to get you in a rapture it's going to take a dine out to yourself it's going to take a heart cry to where you meet god 101 in your spirit and say lord i don't like the person i am today i look in the mirror of your word and say i want to i i'm not who i want to be but here's what i want to do i want to repent of it i want to throw it aside and i want i want to cast it down and i want to be like you jesus he preaches for repentance and notice here just as we close i know we're 11 45. can i have just a couple more let me get a good hearty amen can i have just a couple more here notice prophet joel he comes with this promise and he says but god says for i will restore notice joel chapter 2 you could put that up if you could verse he says i will restore to you the years this is something only a prophet can see because a prophet has the ability to tr to move out of the current dimension and what it currently looks like and he could see around the corner of what god's trying to bring you to and he says for i will restore saith the lord all the all the locusts i will restore you the years preaching on restoring years that the locusts hath eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you notice david picks up on the same inspiration he says in psalms chapter one you can pull that up for me psalms chapter 1 and david begins to say this here in verse 1 of psalms 1. i'll give just a moment he says blessed is the man that walketh not of the council of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful notice verse 2 here he says but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night verse 3 and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth fruit in his season his leath his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper notice this is a promise not not to the wicked but this is to those who separated themselves unto the lord he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water this is in the middle this is in the middle the right in the middle of the height and the zenith the crescendo the pinnacle of satan's eden when the rest of the world is going crazy and going insane and the rest of the world's getting more drunk and in a stupor but he who's he the righteous in the middle of all of that shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that brings forth fruit oh i want to say lord what do you have promised for my life i'm like a tree planted by the rivers of water i just say yes lord amen lord be it unto me according to your word lord whose fruit who bringeth forth fruit whose leafs do not wither david says but the ungodly are not so they become weak they become withered they're like the chaff with the wind they ungodly are not so they're tossed blown about by every wind of doctrine this is what a compromiser of the word looks like it's a withered tree diseased the outside veneer looks good looks fine on the outside but inwardly it's corrupted with every conceivable worm cankerworm and caterpillar oh i'm afraid this is the picture of much of professed believers today they neglect their bible they neglect their prayer life they neglect their reading of the word they regret neglect the assembling of themselves they neglect neglect the worshipping of the lord they become too preoccupied with life and they become lazy spiritually joel says this in verse 12. he says all the trees of the field are withered for their joy has dried up oh and joe's heart is heartbroken as he sees this condition of god's chosen people notice god still calls it his vine they hath they have laid my vine waste he still calls it even in that condition what does that vine speak of speaks of israel oh the whole nation calls him that over and over and over like a vine out of it out of egypt have i called you they have laid my vine waste he's heartbroken over this condition spiritual condition of israel he says it he hath he hath the teeth of a great lion he's laid in my vine waste and barked my fig tree chewed off the bark the branches there ever white think of it friends a forest debarked clean bare bleached white with disease what vivid language joel uses languished dried up withered wasted desolate broken down barns rotten seed trees on fire say brother matt what is he what is he talking about he's speaking the same thing that revelations 3 says about the ladies in church that says i'm fine i'm good i'm increased with goods i have need of nothing but knowest thou not you're miserable poor naked blind and you don't even know it you don't even realize it that an army of canker worms and caterpillars has been eating your life outwardly you appear as a tree planted by the living water but inwardly you're corrupted and weak and diseased you're not bearing fruit you're dried up spiritually this is what sin does this is what sin does adultery and drinking and worldliness that's what dirty that's what that's what the filth of the world does i watched it it's amazing watching on a plane and you just watched the screens and my screens pulled up and i'm tracking the flight here got my laptop out just looking at all my notes and i just stopped for a minute it's incredible i had my headphones on listening to the prophet and it's almost like you just go into a world of your own like a sphere of your own and i'm i'm there on the plane and the joy of the lord is just flowing and i'm weeping and i'm just there thank god there's nobody beside me in my entire rows empty and i'm just having a little revival meeting there and just an expectation and the lord's dealing almost as fear i could feel the presence of god and i opened my eyes and here's the screens of filth and vile and nudity and and and and basic basically on the television today watching some tv series that's just filthy and vulgar and vile now listen to me friends you that has no place in the appetite to a son or daughter of god what is it doing to the world it's a drunken stupor just give me more more shows and more netflix and more series i can just engulf myself in and outwardly i'll keep my christian manicure and my christian appearance and my outward appearance but inwardly inwardly corruption and spiritual death i just i couldn't believe it i opened my eyes and hear people i think you've lost all fear of god you're on a plane that is in the hands of a man it could crash at any moment we could go plunging to the to to the earth and here you are in a drunken stupor watching some of the most filthy vile things you say brother matt what was your attitude oh god like brother adam says he got the attitude oh just wipe them out lord and he said but then god showed me a great blood banner around the entire earth entire universe and he said i seen the sins come up from the earth and they would just slap the lord jesus in the face and brother branham says the voice of the lord said those are your sins you know what that does to me it makes me look inwardly and say lord i could be out of this sphere i could be just like one of them but somehow grace has called my name somehow you've called me out of the darkness oh my brother my sister you you ought to rejoice you ought to say lord thank you for your blood thank you for grace that's called me it's made me different canker worms and caterpillars destruction eating away driving people from the presence of god attacking making it unhealthy spiritually frail and spiritually weak it's no wonder we don't have depression and anxiety and mental conditions like we do today what was it they've gotten away brother adam said what was it i've gotten away from the original faith the original truth brother branham begins to speak of this i just hear in the heard this last i'm going to read it to you today you can put that on the screen brother jeremy there in the back he says not long ago i was thinking i was way up in canada i was riding one night and way back about 40 50 miles a thousand miles from a hard top road last fall was back there hunting i was riding out through the moonlight and i come to where there was a big old burnover now those of you who live in tucson and you don't have burnovers we back east we have big forests of trees and and to keep you know you do that here i guess too maybe to where you try to keep the brush under control up there in the mountains and and and and i'm sure they have controlled burns where they're burning things to prevent a big forest fire he says that was a big burnover thousand miles from a hardtop was riding out through the moonlight i have it here come to where was a big old burnover there was a great big bunch of great big tall stately pines and the moon was shining on them looked like a graveyard a spooky looking place remember he's there at night he's there at night time and he come comes out of the forest and he comes with this great big burnover and big stately pines and he says oh it was just a spooky looking place he says and there come a wind coming down and the wind began to hit them and they'd go mood just almost like an eerie sound i've heard that before i almost raised the hairs on back your neck up they'd go mood just a mournful sound i stood and i looked at it a little bit and i thought of the scripture right here yes sir you know what brother man is referring to this scripture in joel he's preaching bomber worm locust cancer and caterpillar he says it reminded me of this scripture right here those trees puts me in a mind of some of these great big fine spired churches standing up here but just as dead as a door now even the palmer worms ate all of the bark off of them and everything else the fiery trials has blazed all the spirit away from it and there's nothing left but a big stature as dead as can be and he says uh as dead as can be and when the rushing mighty wind comes from heaven the only thing they can do is groan and carry on and say it ain't so that's right hardly know anything that's right they just they say days of miracles is past just every time god sends a revival and signs and wonders begin to come up fall around the people and things like that they say oh the days of miracles has passed what the palmer worm left the caterpillar eaten what the methodist left the baptist eaten what the baptist left the presbyterian eaten what the presbyterian left the pentecost eaten till it's got to a place god why you stripped the tree of everything it's got all the power all the joy all the good things that god give to his church on the day of pentecost they've tore it out nothing left but a big church name hallelujah that's what brother branham says hallelujah just a big church name what's the matter watch the same thing you've took the route of the dead tree watched the palmer worm left the caterpillar eaten the baptist took the shouting away from the methodists and one eat this and one eat that till they stripped the church down until they got them setting just as dead as a doornail all just be honest with you friends satan's done the same thing to some of our message churches taking the joy out taking the revival out taking the shouting the dancing out till all we've got is a big old church name and when the wind of the fire of god comes down it's just a hallelujah he says the palmer and the caterpillar the baptist took the shouting the method is one ate this one ate that until they stripped the church down they got them sitting just as dead as a door now no spirit no shouting no joy no peace no healing no nothing how oh my what the method is left the baptist eaten what the baptist left the caterpillar eating or some other church and this one ate and this one took away and this one took away you haven't gotten nothing but just a church creed hallelujah you know that's the truth you know what brother matt thinks when i read this i say don't let it be me god i don't have any interest in a dead formal cold religion of a god of yesterday or what he did yesterday and just coming and fulfilling some religious duty i don't believe i believe you today could say i have no interest in that lord i want the spirit of god i want the moving of god i want the joy and the shouting and the river of life to flow through my body he says and this one eats and this one took away and took that away you haven't got nothing but a church creed you know that's the truth that's the truth what one left the other eight listen to this until you ain't got nothing but a big dead tree and every time god sends doubt sends a big rush of glory down you just sit there and moan and say i don't believe it it's psychology it's this it's that it's this it's that we'll move he says dead from the roots twice dead plucked up by the roots it's a sad looking day when joel looked at that and saw that he said but god said i will restore saith the lord oh i could hear the words of a kentucky hillbilly in my headphones say hallelujah oh what was he doing he was taking courage and a promise that it doesn't matter what it looks like right now god's going to restore all that the cankerworm all that the caterpillar has eaten he's going to give breath back to his church if it wasn't there listen to what brother branham says i could hear him i heard it last night he says if it wasn't in there he read this joel 2 i will restore saith the lord he says if it wasn't in there i would know how to preach it but i will restore saith the lord listen to what brother adam says i happened to look that night there when the wind was blowing through how stiff and starchy and dead it was sitting there moaning and groaning didn't have no life to bend with it that's how people get sometimes they got so much religion i've been in the message for so long and so many years and bless god i was there when brother branham was there and i was there out in the meetings but let me just say where are you now do you have life now where's the god of that prophet is he in your heart now oh can you say amen to the word today friends he says brother adam says what is it they have no life to get them to bend they're too stiff and starchy and dead sitting there moaning and groaning didn't have no life to bend with no bark on it to make it flexible it was just there moaning and groaning on account of the wind huh my doctor so and so so oh my but i happen to notice oh i love this part right here he says but i happen to notice down underneath there was some undergrowth coming up some little bushes about like that they had life in them when that wind began to hit them they was just twisting and ringing and shouting and having a glorious time let me tell you brother god's going to raise up a generation of people out of this dead stuff that's going to restore saith the lord god's going to raise up people who believes in signs and wonders going to raise up people who's got joy unspeakable and full of glory and when the rushing mighty wind comes it gives right into it and frolicks and dances and glorifies god hallelujah i say i'm that seed of that young bush i didn't want no dead cold formal denominationalism i didn't want a religion of a dead god or an image or an idol but i wanted the wind of the holy spirit to be able to move me oh brother madam says hallelujah green leaves clapping their hands having a wonderful time well what a frolic that little undergrowth undergrowth was having but but that big old tree standing there just moaning and groaning same wind same wind look the same wind was making one moaning groan was giving the other one a big time and i happen to think well that's what's the what's this one doing and every time that little tree would twist what would it do it would pull the roots loosen up the ground so it could grow deeper and get a better hold oh i want to preach and just say this morning lord don't ever let me become starchy don't ever let me become dale dead don't ever let me settle for some religion or some idol or something i'll just form or fashion but let me say moving to the power of the holy ghost let my experience be fresh and daily let it become real oh i believe there's hearts here today who can identify and say lord i don't want to be that old stately pine i want to be that little undergrowth bush who dances and twirls and spins to the spirit and the rhythm of the music of the great composer i want to stay alive i want to stay real he says oh what would it do it could grow deeper and get a better hold hallelujah hallelujah i say lord let me fill the breeze the wind of calvary let it blow over my heart let it blow over my home let me hear the words as joel begins to prophesy and says i will restore saith the lord i restore all the years of the canker worm and the caterpillar and the palmer worm whatever what is the years it's the missed harvest it's the it's the misfruit it's the mist increased and god says i will restore it all say how do i get there brother matt it starts with repentance starts with a turning it starts with a rending if i could just be just transparent with you today i could say lord let me throw down i could hear brother branham say you ought to throw down your pride you're to throw down your pride and brother madam says and then smash it under your feet stomp it under your feet and say lord i'm throwing down my pride because i want to get to jesus whatever i've got to do lord whatever i've got to do musicians could you come i will restore the years that the locusts and the cankerworm and the caterpillar my great army joel says my great army which i sent here's what's promised total repentance brings total restoration you play that song the brother peter saying lost are saved find their way brother peter could you come sing that if you don't mind total repentance god sins total restoration all the years the locusts the palmer worm the cankerworm the caterpillar whatever he's stolen from you well you can have it today friend it's a promise god says i want to bring you to this this is what i see notice what he says in joel 2 he says be be glad you children of zion the floor shall be full of wheat and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil oh don't think naturally not talking about the next newest nicest car or the next greatest latest i'm talking about a spiritual experience by the baptism of the holy ghost you say that comes to coober the mat that comes to those who seek those who thirst that's why jesus says blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled and i say lord i'm thirsting i'm hungering saying to your feet oh you could raise a hand to the lord and you could bow your head with me this morning you get in an honesty you could cry out and say lord i'm hungering and thirsting for righteousness then here's what's promised god says oh it shall come to pass afterward that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions you shall know i'm in the midst of israel that i am the lord your god and none else and my people shall never be ashamed you know what it is it's a promise that i didn't make because if i made it i'd have to keep it but it's a promise that the lord jesus made it's a promise that peter stood on the day of pentecost and said this is that these men are not drunk as you suppose but this is that which the prophet joel prophesied that your young men shall see visions your old men shall see these euro men shall dream dreams what was it he says this is that which he promised i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh and then peter continues and says for the promise for the promise is unto you unto your children unto your family to every generation to each generation that calls for it and cries for it is willing to die out to it and say it doesn't matter if mama doesn't go it doesn't matter if daddy doesn't go it doesn't matter if the church doesn't go i'm not looking for some preacher or some person or some way great wave of something but i'm here recognizing that there's a wave of the holy spirit right now and i want to raise a hand and say lord i'm responding to that today may you charge me with the electricity of the holy ghost and fire may it come down and burn out all the sin and burn out and clean out all the living until i can stand fully restored what you envisioned god what you promised lord of what you promised not me to my home and to my family and to my children i will restore saith the lord how many wants it here today the head bowed an eyes closed you can just not to me not to me i'm not even gonna look but you can just take a moment and say i'm going to reach out a hand i'm going to grab a hold of that lifeline i'm going to grab a hold of a real jesus a real risen savior i'm going to let go of anything in the past anything that's driven me to formality anything that's driven me to coldness and i don't care what happened yesterday there's a god who's alive there's a god who's sending quickening power and i'm gonna grab a hold of it today i'm gonna lift my hands and say i take it i take it lord jesus right now for my heart let today let it start right now don't have to care about what happened yesterday i don't have to care about what's going to happen tomorrow but let it start right now lord jesus let it

ghost that's bro brooding and spreading like a tidal wave do you say to hoover the map to any family to any home to any heart that'll just open the door and say let the tidal wave of the holy ghost rush over my home rest over my soul i just want to say lord let me be a part of it let me be in part of it let me be right in the thick of it let then send it lord send the rain [Music] send the rain

my spirit saith the lord and god your spirit's pushing your spirit lord it's it's pressing trying to press in trying lord what have we done by the preaching of the word your prophet said the preaching of the word drives back evil spirits it puts them at bay whatever spirit they might have came to church with this morning whatever spirit of depression or gloom or depression or whatever it is the
