there's a praise as well from brother Tim Cruz I was having a little pressure in my chest and felt a little short of breath when I would lay down at night the brothers prayed for me and I've been free

honor and glory in Jesus Christ's name amen this morning is going to be a little different our brother Lyle is going to be ministering and then directly after that we are going to be having a vote for brother Dan so keep it in a matter of prayer but let's not so much focus on the vote let's focus on what brother Lyle is going to bring forth if you come anticipating the Lord to meet with us then he'll be here so as brother Lyle comes let's just sing that one more time only believe [Music] all things [Music] [Applause] only believe all things are possible only believe [Music] good morning welcome to 2023 and please stay for a moment here just want to see if this is uh yes I'm reminded this morning of a song that we used to sing as young people back in 1970 and 71. that probably excludes most of you but that's okay it's a song from Psalms 19. if you don't know it the tune is simple and you really need to sing out so you don't have to listen to my croaking up here see if we can get this up here [Music] the law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul a testimony of the Lord is sure making wise the simple more to be desired are they than gold yea then much fine gold sweeter also that honey [Music] and the honeycomb the statutes of the Lord are right rejoicing the heart the Commandment of the Lord is pure and lightning the eyes [Music] it desired are they than gold yea then much fine gold sweeter also then honey and the honeycomb the fear of the Lord is clean enduring forever the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous all together much fine gold sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb moreover by them is thy servant war is thy servant [Music] moreover by them is I served one and in keeping of them there is great reward there is great reward [Music] and in keeping of them there is great rewards thank you so much Lord help us to be warned this morning by Your Word help us to keep it it's unusual to see me up here on a Sunday morning to deliver the message I'll be brief because we're voting in a short while to elect a brother to be our pastor for the next six months before we approach the word and read from its Pages let's speak with the author together as one Lord Jesus this is a momentous time it's the beginning of a new year that the world recognizes we see a world in great stress great trauma we see War we see threats we see so much going on in this day but Lord in this day more than ever we want to be your people Lord we want to stand up for what's right we want to stand up for your word Lord we want to be filled with your spirit and we want you to move in our midst Lord I asked this morning that you'd help me Lord this nervous vessel standing in front of the blood-bought congregation the ones that you paid such a tremendous price for to bring to this hour to bring to this moment and to bring to this day that the words that are spoken today Lord be words that honor you may be your words may you speak this morning and may we hear what you have for us we commit the remainder of this service entirely completely and totally into your hands and we're depending on you this morning Lord Jesus amen recently my wife Heather and I have been studying about the Dead Sea Scrolls the qumran community that wrote and preserved them it's part of the reason that I wanted to open this morning by singing a song I want to share with you one of my takeaways from that study but before we do that if we could stand in honor of the word I want to read two short scriptures with you this morning the first in fact both of them are from The Book of Revelation from chapters one and chapter 10. the first one will be from chapter 1 verse 19. Jesus is speaking to the Apostle John and he's giving him directions he says write the things John which thou Hast seen the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter we see that John has a directive to write to share with posterity the Visions the information which he is about to have revealed to him by the Lord because he was faithful and because others over the centuries following were faithful to carefully transcribe what John first wrote we have this book today the next verse I want to read is from chapter 10. Revelation chapter 10. can you guess which verse I'm going to read not verse 7. not verse 8. let's read from verse 4. and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I that is John the Apostle I was about to write that's what Jesus told me to do to write these things I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from heaven saying unto me John seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered don't even write them down seven funders powerful stuff I hear a question brother Lyle what does that have to do with qumran what does that have to do with us today in Tucson on the first day of 2023. whoever that was that ask that question thank you it's a very good question the answer is what I'm going to be sharing with you this morning please be seated notice John was about to write what the seven Thunder said he was told not to write it down in other words John knew what they were he knew what they said it wasn't mysterious to him he wasn't told to write them down and then roll it up in a scroll and seal it that it could be unveiled at some later time he was told to seal it up and keep it a secret by not even writing it down it reminds me a little bit of Abraham Lincoln somebody asked Lincoln once if he could keep a secret and his response was of course I can keep a secret it's the people I tell that can't keep the secret I think it's safe to say that the Lord trusted John to be obedient and that the Lord entrusted John with what we today might refer to as deep revelation well we know that when John had these Visions he was exiled to the island of Patmos this map here just tries to give you a bit of an idea down in the lower right you see the Mediterranean you see Greece and Italy and Egypt and Israel and Turkey to give you an idea of where all this is happening then this little red square is the big thing here you see Pat misses this island off the coast of Turkey and the other town that I've indicated is Ephesus it's only 50 or 60 miles away it's where when John completed his period of Exile and Atmos and Patmos and was allowed to return that's where he spent the last years of his life we'll get back to John when he was in Ephesus in a little while in the 20th century of our time we believe that God entrusted a man called brother William Branham with Revelations about many of the mysterious things contained from the pages of this book in fact brother Perry green started this Church Tucson Tabernacle in 1965 specifically so brother Branham could have a place in Tucson to worship and to share well along with the Apostle John we'll get back to brother random in just a little bit but now let's take a look at the dedicated worshipers of the Lord who lived in a community near the Dead Sea a community called qumran this map shows the location of qumran you can see the Dead Sea and just at the North and slightly to the West you can see the settlement of qumran there's a few caves that are marked there were these Dead Sea skulls some of the caves where the Scrolls were found but qumran is located as you can see up a bit to the east of Jerusalem Jerusalem is on top of a hill here the Judean Hills elevation about 2700 feet qumran is at the bottom of the Jordan Rift Valley the lowest place on Earth that's not underwater 1300 feet below sea level there's four thousand feet of elevation difference between Jerusalem and qumran it's uh it reminds me a little bit if you've ever been to Phantom Ranch the bottom of the Grand Canyon and you look up towards Grand Canyon Village up on the rim it's not quite that much difference in elevation but it's similar to the difference of course is that if you're at Phantom Ranch and you're thirsty the Colorado River well the Colorado Creek or is is there and you might be able to find some water to drink when I was uh at the Dead Sea many years ago I stuck my finger in the Dead Sea and tasted the water I did it exactly once it's it's horrible oily salty brine I was smart enough to not do it a second time well this community in qumran it's believed to have been the same as the sect called the essenes described by Josephus he described three basic Jewish sects the essenes the Pharisees the Sadducees whether these folks were the essenes or not there were certainly a lot of parallels but we know that the people that lived in this settlement of qumran they sought to serve God the god of the Bible the god whose laws are recorded by the prophet Moses they were diligent they were zealous of the word they were deeply sincere they separated themselves from the world to the extent possible they preserved the word they gave us the oldest manuscript copies of the oldest Testament that we now have prior to finding the Dead Sea Scrolls the earliest texts that we had Hebrew texts were called the masoretic texts and the earliest of those was dated to about 900 A.D about 1100 years ago but the Dead Sea schools pushed that back to nearly 200 BC nearly 2200 years ago they were a very conservative group they were rigorously strict in their observance of the Bible as they understood it the Torah as well as their own Community rules becoming part of their Community was not easy among other things you had to give the community your wealth and live in a carefully prescribed highly regulated way there are a lot of parallels to early Christianity but they were not a Christian sect the documents recovered from the caves around qumran date back to as far as 150 to 200 BC the time of the maccabean revolt the establishment of the hasmonean dynasty the cleansing of the Jerusalem Temple the accompanying Miracle of Hanukkah was about 168 BC so they saw these miracles in their times the community was very much in existence in the times of John the Baptist and Jesus ministry much of the ministry of the Apostles after Jesus death John would have been baptizing just about where the word cave 11 is up there that they were aware of what was going on well moving on to this community the Dead Sea schools there are some 930 documents or document fragments in the collection of what we call the Dead Sea Scrolls many of them are books of the Bible there are a lot of other works in there as well some of them are quite lengthy we have a a complete copy of the book of Isaiah for example but in other cases their little scraps of parchment with only a few letters this image is something that was found only about three or four years ago as they're still sifting through caves in that area this is the most recent find and had been 60 years to the previous lines and you can see they're just little tiny scraps that have been arranged here the scale there zero to five that's centimeters that's two inches and there's several scraps there and this is a tiny fraction of one of the Minor Prophets they found scraps of nakum and Zachariah I'm not sure which this represents but this is the kind of research and work and assembling of talk about jigsaw puzzles to try and put this together and understand what's being said well the the first set of seven Scrolls were fortunately not just tiny scraps but largely complete documents were found in late 1947 the Bedouin Shepherds had found them I'm sure you're familiar with the story they sold or traded them to a felony in cando who was a Shoemaker in part-time Antiquities dealer in Bethlehem he took the seven and divide them into a group of four and a group of three the group of three was attained a great personal Risk by a man named Eliezer sukenik on behalf of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and he obtained it as we've shared before on November 29th 1947. he was unrolling and reading that scroll for the first time in nearly two thousand years at the very moment that the U.N was voting to partition Palestine into a Jewish and Arab state to set the stage that only six months later the modern state of Israel would be born I can't imagine what he was feeling as he read these words saw that they matched up so closely with everything that he had read previously at the very moment that the vote is going on to re-establish National Israel well those three Scrolls that he obtained were a partial Isaiah scroll a collection of songs called the Thanksgiving hymns and a document called the war School the war scroll describes the ultimate battle between what they called the Sons of light and the sons of Darkness the final showdown between good and evil their equivalent of our battle of Armageddon it details the armies the strategies the weapons and so forth It's a manual for that upcoming battle unknown to Dr sukenik at that time a shock was to be in store for the readers and others who studied this document a few decades later I believe that there's a lesson in there for us as well over the centuries the Jewish people had developed a set of rules that supplemented the written law as set down in the Torah and the five books of Moses the rules are often called the oral law the the is how they refer to it a lot when I lived in Israel I was asking some of the rabbis so so what is this and and they explained it and I'll do a very poor job but let's say that you've got something very holy and you put it you put it on the altar and you build a fence around it because you don't want to get too close to it you don't want to pollute it and that fence that's the 613 Commandments that are contained in the laws of Moses but you want to break that you don't want to violate that fence you don't want to break those laws so they put a second fence a little further out where they interpreted these laws and a little further they took it another step so that if you broke one of these rules you would not have broken one of the laws but you would still repent and back off this was their their Theory this was their justification this was their reason for doing this sort of thing they wanted to be so sure that they never violated this holy thing that they created a fence that was that was even further out but the focus then began to shift from the law to these rules at least so it was so for the common people they lost Focus on the laws because they became too concerned about the rules Jesus talked about this in Mark chapter 7 we read then came together unto Jesus the Pharisees and certain of the scribes which came from Jerusalem and when they saw some of Jesus disciples eat bread with defiled that is to say unwashed hands they found fault the Pharisees inscribed asked Jesus why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders but he'd read with unwashed hands and Jesus answered and said to them well has Isaiah prophesied of you hypocrites actors Pretenders as it is written this people on Earth me with their lips but their heart is far from me how be it in vain after they worship me teaching for Doctrine substituting for doctrines the Commandments of men laying aside the Commandment of God you hold the tradition of men as the washing of pots and cups and many other such-like things you do and he goes on to give them examples now Jesus is not saying you shouldn't wash your hands before you eat he's not saying that but he's saying the Traditions the rules have replaced the Commandments and words of God with the rules and words of men well these sets of rules in general are referred to as the halacha in Hebrew halach to walk to go it's it's how you go it's how you proceed in life it's that's how they attempted to apply the scriptures to the changing circumstances of their day and time as you might expect different groups of Jewish people had differing views on how to apply the law and and what the rules really were and on and on leading to various sects moving back closer to our day after Israel's war of independence in 1948 the caves around qumran were again being explored realize that this area the Dead Sea all of that was under Jordanian control it didn't come under Israeli control until after the Six Day War of 1967. well the nearby caves were numbered they'd go into a cave near the settlement and if they found anything they would okay we just did cave one we found something here this is cave too if the cave was empty it didn't get a number and they would then carefully sift through things find all these fragments as you saw that slide earlier worked their way through that and then examine another cave and another cave in K4 they found literally hundreds of school fragments one of these is known among scholarly circles is 4q mmt well the four just means it came from K4 anything from cave one is one the queue is for qumran that's where these caves are located the mmt is is from a Hebrew phrase which I will not attempt to pronounce but it means some precepts of the Torah or some rulings pertaining to the Torah this this document this 4q mmt is pieced together from several fragments from fragments 394 through 399 that were found in that cave as I say there were hundreds of fragments this document is 4q mmt is often referred to as the halachic letter don't worry there won't be a test these fragments were recovered between 1953 and 1959 the composition of this letter is dated to about 150 BC the text however wasn't released until 1994. after some 40 years of research and investigation this document 4q mmt is unique because it's the only letter that we found it wasn't a transcription of a book or a manual it was a letter written from this community as such it gives us a significant view some insight into the qumran community and how they viewed certain interpretations of the Torah in it there are 20 points of interpretation of Jewish law and practice that are detailed the letter appears to be from the qumran sex teacher of righteousness that their guy okay so it says well we see this but you do that it's written to the Sadducees apparently and and and they do this other well they are the Pharisees let me show you just one of the points imagine you have a vessel in this case I'm just showing a bowl with water in a cup but but let's say that it's that it's a large Pottery vessel or brass vessel or something containing holy oil for the menorah okay well you can't lift this really big jug of stuff to hold it up to the lamp to fill it so you pour it from this big jug into this smaller container so you can then take that smaller container and put the oil in the menorah so you can light the lamps so this larger vessel contains a liquid something that is ritually pure this vessel this large bowl that's being poured from also is richly pure so you're pour it into this lower vessel and then oops you discovered that that lower vessel it's unclean it's not richly pure somebody made a mistake so here's the question does the clean liquid purify the unclean vessel or does the unclean vessel cause the liquid within it to be impure and more and beyond that what about that stream that's flowing from the upper vessel to the lower is that stream Pure or is it now impure and what about all the contents of that upper vessel are is that all now contaminated and has to be discarded and what about that vessel itself that upper vessel is it now unclean as well foreign the Pharisees and Sadducees in this particular case held that well the lower vessel was unclean and the stuff that's entered unclean and you've got to go through whatever the levitical law says that you do depending upon What that particular stuff happens to be but that the main vessel and the liquid that's in it is is still fine no the essene said no qumran they said the whole it's all unclean you've got to get rid of all of it you've got to start over from scratch we look at that and we say really this was a point that was so important to them that they were willing to break Fellowship they were willing to set up a community by the Dead Sea and not even go to Jerusalem because Jerusalem was polluted the temple was polluted and they would have nothing to do with that but the release of this letter sent shock waves through some circles within Judaism prior to this it was believed that the various sects within Judaism the essenes the Sadducees the Pharisees and the second temporal time were separated over doctrinal issues is there life after death we know of Jesus discussion with the Sadducees about that this letter made it clear that the separations weren't based on major issues of Doctrine but slight differences of interpretation of issues that The Outsiders at least are trivial they just don't matter what are you making a big deal about this for but what was the real shocker when they looked at the phrases how the wording was done in this and the wording in other documents it became clear that in that war scroll that Dr sukenik had been reading on November 29 1947. the sons of Light it's not the followers of the Torah versus the atheists and the Romans in the World At Large the sons of Light were the qumran community the evil the sons of Darkness were the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the other Jewish Believers that didn't see it quite the way they saw it oh my they all believed the same message from Moses but they interpreted it differently Jesus said Jerusalem Jerusalem which kills the prophets which Stones those that are sent to thee how often I would have gathered thy children together as a hen gathers her throat under her wings but you would not Jesus is saying this at the time of the qumran community is there and the Pharisees and the Sadducees you would not eat sect thought they were right and the others were wrong they interpreted the message of their day a little differently than the other guy to the point they had little or no Fellowship they refused to be gathered together they were so busy squabbling and separating and so focused on being right that they missed the coming of the Lord I'm sorry brothers and sisters when I read that and I read this and I thought Lord where are we today we're looking for a Rapture we're looking for the coming of the Lord and if we can't even gather together if we can't get past our differences what are we going to miss what are we gonna miss he said look for this reason the fact that you refuse if you get along and gathered together with me your house is Left To You desolate verily I say to you ye shall not see me until that kind come when you say blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord we see with their deep Revelation led to with the qumran community spiritual arrogance separation from fellowship and eventually desolation they went through the tribulation of their day the Roman Conquest the destructions I'm sure you see the parallels and the dangers to us today we we talk about a rapture my brothers and sisters until we can sit down together till we can be gathered together here on planet Earth and Tucson or Jeffersonville or wherever as brothers and sisters in spite of differing viewpoints and perspectives and interpretations that are oh so right we're not going to be caught away together if you can't stand Toe to Toe and bitterly disagree and still love each other look who had more Revelation than Jesus Christ himself look what he said to the twelve as they prepared to walk from Jerusalem to Gethsemane his very last moments together with these precious disciples that he invested three years of his life into he's pouring out his heart to them and what does he say to them John 13 33 little children yet a little while and I'm with you you don't know but in a few hours I'm going to be taken I'm believing so much sooner than you think and you're going to seek me and as I said to the Jews where I go you can't come I say the same to you you can't come where I'm going however a new commandment I give you a new commandment here it is going to tell us the secret of the Rapture the moment we've been waiting for we're listening Lord what is this new commandment love one another as I've loved you that you also love one another what that's it by this by this shall all men know you're my disciples not because you have great Revelation if you have love one to another not some deep revelation of some Arcane or obscure mystery not recitations not quotes but love expressed in sacrificial office later that same evening that last evening John 15 as the father hath loved me so have I loved you continue in my love if you keep my Commandments you shall abide in my love you'll dwell in my love you'll live in my love even as I kept my father's Commandments and abide in his love these things have I spoken unto you that my joy my my children was my comedy light my my exceeding gladness might remain in you and that your joy might be full this is my commandment here it comes how to abide in his love that you love one another as I have loved you greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends you're my friends if you do whatsoever I command you what the oh what is the Commandment go back to verse 12. Jesus is telling them his sacrifices for his friends is an expression of his love but that it loses its meaning if they don't possess that Same Love pretty plain in his final hours with his disciples he's repeating this theme over and over not talking about Mysteries deep Revelations about being right but practical hands on faith that will be observed by The World At Large we read earlier from revelation the Apostle John who had been entrusted with the revelation of Jesus Christ ended his days with one message for all of us and it wasn't about Mysteries it wasn't about obscure or esoteric things after returning from Patmos and living among the Believers at Ephesus John wrote First John 3 11. this is the message that you heard from the beginning that we should love one another did he change this theme well let's look at his next letter second John 1 4. I John Rejoice greatly that I found of thy children Walking In Truth as we received a commandment from the father and now I beseech thee lady not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee but that which we had from the beginning that we love one another I think brother Branham Illustrated it in his last time they would prop John up and he'd get behind that thing he could barely stand up he was so old and he'd say look one another love one another the Apostle Paul he told us that he had physical ailments to keep him humble after the amazing Revelations that God shared with him look what he wrote to the Corinthian Church would just read one verse First Corinthians 13 verse 2. he says and though I Paul have the gift of Prophecy and though I Paul understand all mystery Mr and though I Paul have all knowledge and though I Paul have all Faith so I could remove mountains and I Paul have not loved I Paul and nothing I'm worthless I'm useless I have no value in recent times I I used to say in our day but for many of you 1965 was before you were born so I'll say in recent times brother Branham whose teachings we claim to follow told us over and over again to love one another say nice things about each other I'm reminded of a testimony we recently heard about a statement by Brother Billy paulbrand and brother branham's oldest child that he personally could not tell who his father's friends were and who his enemies were by the way that he treated them when asked about the greatest the most important the foremost commandment Jesus said Mark 12 he answered the first of all the Commandments is here listen up Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind with all thy strength Jesus says this is the first commandment it is from Deuteronomy 6 Verses 4 and 5 to 10 commandments from Deuteronomy 5 this isn't even part of the ten The Ten Commandments are subservient to this and he goes on he wasn't asked but he went on he says the second it's like namely this that was a Love by neighbor is thyself this is part of Leviticus 19 18. again it's not even part of the Ten Commandments but the Ten Commandments are subservient to this Jesus goes on he says there's no other commandment there's no other command ment greater than these no other Matthew's accounted the same event includes one more detail I think it's a very important detail Matthew 22 he says the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself and he says on these two Commandments hang all the law and prophets now this was written way before the prophets uttered a word a prophet's subsequent to Moses Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekiel Malachi John the Baptist brother Branham and all hangs on these two all if all the subsequent prophets revealed hang on these then there's no greater Revelation to be had been the truth of these two statements Jesus Illustrated who is my neighbor with a story that we call the Good Samaritan caring for those who were outside you you Circle Samaritans and Jews despised each other they had segregation they did not get along so Jesus talking to a Jewish audience uses an illustration of a spies Samaritan being a better neighbor than they were to their own genre of Revelations what are the words of his Epistles love one another brother branham's older son said he could not tell by his behavior who were his dad's friends and who were his enemies I want to conclude this short message with two brief statements from a sermon brother Branham preached in May 1960. is called the rejected King in this sermon he had related an experience which he called beyond the curtain of time I think most of you perhaps all of you are familiar with this he says I Heard a Voice then that spoke to me that was in the room said this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost this is perfect love nothing can enter here without and the final quote that I would like to read to you this morning that the musicians could come at this time brother Branham is pouring his heart out oh my precious friends my beloved my darlings of the Gospel might be God and children unto God listen to me your pastor you I wish there was some way I could explain it to you there's no words I couldn't find it it's not found anywhere but just beyond this last breath is the most glorious thing that you ever there's no way to explain it there's no way I just can't do it but whatever you do friend lay aside every thing everything else till you get perfect love get to a spot that you can love everybody every enemy everything else we're in this together regardless of the vote regardless of who takes the reins of leadership in this assembly your pastor won't get you to heaven and he won't be your judge I want to admonish each of us including myself our Revelations our immersion in the word our times of devotion our times of study our times of prayer should only lead us into a deeper relationship of love for God and love for our neighbor if it takes us anywhere else if it takes us to criticism to intolerance to feelings of smugness or superiority a sense of exclusiveness or Pride we need to step back we need to come to the altar [Music] we need to seek prayer we need to seek healing we need to seek Deliverance never arrogance never Pride never like those that qumran but love service like Jesus let's pray together one more time lord Jesus these few words Lord I pray that they would strike in our hearts because they're your words the words that you spoke they're from the pages of your Bible and that they could grow in our heart and draw us closer to you into one another preparing us for that great day that we believe is so soon Upon Us Lord we don't want to be right we want to have that love in our heart that draws us to you and draws us to each other we commit the remainder of the services vote that's going to happen this morning we commit it all to you it's in your hands and we trust you Jesus name as I believe brother Ed is coming to lead us in the voting I wonder if we could sing to be like Jesus I think that should be our desire this morning [Music] brother Ed would come at this time or whoever is going to do this now [Music] to be like Jesus [Music] on Earth foreign from Earth to Glory [Music] as we prepare to change the order of the service once again let's just sing that is that your desire to be like him I I just want to be like him I don't want to be like myself [Music] to be like Jesus to be like Jesus on [Music] Earth's Journey from Earth to Glory I only yes to be like this morning we're going to go to a vote this vote's for brother Daniel if for whatever reason brother Daniel doesn't get the majority then we will automatically pass out new ballots for brother Peter I trust that you've spent the last week the last few days seeking to face the Lord and how you're devote this isn't about us this is about what God wants for this assembly I like brother Daniel but my my vote's not for brother Daniel because I like him it's because the I feel or or brother Peter how the Lord has led me to vote so that's the way this vote should be this vote is going to be for the local assembly and on the ballot as most of you know the eligibility for voting is at least 18. you support the Tabernacle with your ties and offerings and you attend regularly whether it's here in person physically and for those that can't be here via streaming or however so we trust that you'll understand we pray that the Lord has his way so I heard a little sermon this week and brother Branham says the holy spirit will lead if you expect him to lead so let us expect God to come take control let's expect God to have his way in this vote so let's just take a couple moments and just meditate and ask the Lord once again to lead us and guide us and let's just go to prayer one more time our gracious Heavenly Father we want to approach you and just ask that you come take control Lord we expect you Lord to delete us and guide us and have your way in the remainder of this service and we pray Lord that Lord you lead each brother and sister Lord according to your will Lord and we ask that you you'd receive Glory and Honor no matter what happens Lord help us to get ourselves out of the way and let you lead and we commit this Lord into your hands in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen as the brothers get ready let's just take a moment and pray foreign [Music] thank you [Music] foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign [Music] foreign

God bless you all thank you [Applause] [Music] I think we've been all praying about this week and uh going before the Lord and I must admit that I have been doing the same thing in in praying about this and putting this before God and constantly approaching his throne and I may have lost perspective of the Sunday morning message brother Lyle wonderful oh you'd my brother have truly spoken my heart thank you that was wonderful I I don't necessarily think it's proper uh very often to add to her brother's sermon when he finishes but now as acting Pastor I'd like to say something about your sermon and I want to say thank you for maybe leaving me the um the period at the end of the sentence turn in your Bibles friends quickly to first John chapter chapter 3. verse 18. [Music] [Music] my little children is the Apostle John speaking this is the one that God gave all the revelation as brother Lyle said this is the one that lived the longest of all the Apostles of all the disciples and the one that was called The Beloved disciple the one that laid his head on Jesus's bosom to conclude brother Lyle's sermon it says this my little children let us not love in Word neither in tongue but indeed and in truth friends we can say it all we want to but it comes down to each of us are we willing to do what this word says I am I'm going to do everything I can for a while to live up to that sermon that you preach this morning it blessed my heart so much it did um I also don't like to say that God told me something or um that to speak on behalf of God unless I really feel strongly about something but God gave me a scripture during service and I want to read it Matthew chapter 23. says this speaking of the ministers our lord Jesus talking these words are in red it says the scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses's seat oh therefore whatsoever they bid You observe and not observe and do but do not after their works for they say and they do not for they bind heavy burdens and Grievous to be born and lay them on men's shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers but all their Works they do for to be seen of men they make broad their philacories and enlarge the borders of their garments and love the uppermost rooms at Feasts and chief seats in the synagogues and the greetings in the markets and to be called of men Rabbi rabbi but be ye be not ye called rabbi for one is your master even Christ and all ye are brethren and call no man your father upon the Earth for one is your father which is in heaven neither be ye called Masters for one is your master even Christ but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant and whatsoever and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted and God add the blessings to the reading of his word brother Matthew uh McFadden can you come up my brother friends uh first let me make an announcement there's no service
