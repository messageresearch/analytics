[17:44] sin or iniquity
[17:46] amen
[17:47] what a wonderful blessing we have
[17:48] [Music]
[17:50] just a couple of requests to bring to
[17:52] your attention brother robert figueroa
[17:54] sent me a text a little while ago that
[17:57] our brother steve buckles was in icu
[18:00] with kovid so let's remember our brother
[18:02] steve and then
[18:04] we had mentioned that brother tony
[18:05] ramirez had fallen recently and he
[18:07] struck his head fairly hard
[18:10] they'd take him taken him over to
[18:11] emergency and they didn't find any
[18:14] concussion or anything
[18:15] but he let me know yesterday that he's
[18:17] still suffering from
[18:21] he's afraid to drive right now he's not
[18:23] too sure and things and he said i don't
[18:25] feel bad but something is wrong
[18:28] and they said if it didn't straighten up
[18:30] soon that they would probably have to do
[18:32] another examination so
[18:34] he kind of
[18:37] kids me a little bit because he's fallen
[18:38] a few times he says i'm getting quite
[18:40] good at it and
[18:43] but he just asked us that we would
[18:45] remember him in prayer and then
[18:48] brother alex oberlick he says
[18:50] he's thankful that the knee surgery
[18:53] went smoothly and without complications
[18:56] i'm so thankful
[18:58] that we can look up to you look to him
[19:00] in the time of need so god bless you
[19:02] that's for my brother alex so appreciate
[19:05] that
[19:06] brother peter if you would make your way
[19:07] up
[19:08] here if you could and we'll stand
[19:12] we'll pray over these needs and hi
[19:14] brother peter and then he was going to
[19:15] sing a song and preach a certain no i'll
[19:17] preach the sermon
[19:19] sing a song so we'll let him start and
[19:21] [Music]
[19:22] um it's the privilege of being the emcee
[19:27] you get to embarrass everybody
[19:30] brother peter i appreciate brother peter
[19:32] i really do it's been a public jam with
[19:34] us
[19:36] to
[19:37] become a daddy and responsibility of a
[19:40] family but he's taking it on along with
[19:42] quite a bit other challenges
[19:44] and then
[19:45] lending himself and giving his heart to
[19:47] minister to the body of jesus christ so
[19:50] we'll have him pray over the needs and
[19:53] the service and then he said he had a
[19:55] song so
[19:56] thank you lord god
[20:02] it's good to be here amen
[20:04] let's all pray
[20:06] lord jesus we're so grateful that you're
[20:08] mindful of us lord
[20:11] that you love us and
[20:13] that you see our
[20:15] our needs and before the start of the
[20:17] world before the foundation of the world
[20:20] father you met that need
[20:23] in your own blood and
[20:25] your own sacrifice father you paid the
[20:27] price that we could
[20:28] have our needs met lord that
[20:31] we could have a way to come back to you
[20:34] pray father for every need that's here
[20:36] for
[20:37] for their buckles and
[20:41] for each of the others lord for brother
[20:42] tony ramirez
[20:45] thank you for this knee surgery going
[20:46] well lord for every need that wasn't
[20:49] written down
[20:50] even the needs we don't know about just
[20:52] commit them to your hands
[20:55] trusting in you father
[20:58] in jesus name amen
[21:00] [Music]
[21:04] so i uh
[21:06] i don't have a sure man but i do have a
[21:09] verse that i i thought i'd just read and
[21:12] then
[21:13] i i didn't give sister lily or sister
[21:16] grace any warning on this song so
[21:18] if it doesn't go too well it's not their
[21:20] fault
[21:21] but
[21:21] [Music]
[21:23] if you could just put up luke 21 and 18
[21:28] and
[21:29] question while that's coming up what
[21:30] value do you put on a hair of your head
[21:34] maybe not a lot of value you've got
[21:37] plenty
[21:38] or not too many
[21:40] but
[21:41] you'd probably take a dollar for one
[21:44] but
[21:46] the writer of this bible
[21:49] has put value on the hairs of your head
[21:51] he said not one of not a hair of your
[21:53] head would perish
[21:56] that's that's how interested he is in
[21:58] you
[21:59] and as a body
[22:00] sometimes we don't know what part we are
[22:02] in the body and we think maybe we're
[22:03] just an eyelash
[22:05] but if you're just an eyelash
[22:08] when the bride is standing at the end
[22:10] there won't be an eyelash missing
[22:12] and so he's he's mindful of you
[22:16] so i want to just sing this song
[22:19] i've been wanting to sing it for a while
[22:21] now let me get the words
[22:27] if you know it you can sing it
[22:29] if you don't know it
[22:31] you can still sing it
[22:35] [Music]
[22:39] maybe you could be seated i don't want
[22:40] you to
[22:42] have to be standing
[22:44] [Music]
[22:49] ladies and gentlemen
[22:52] may i have your attention
[22:57] i'd like to
[22:59] introduce to you
[23:05] in this
[23:07] [Music]
[23:13] there stands a champion cold and white
[23:19] his height exceeds the heavens
[23:23] his weight outweighs the world
[23:27] his reach it reaches everywhere
[23:31] his
[23:33] age is ever more
[23:38] he is higher than the highest
[23:42] he's greater than the grave
[23:46] no one could ever
[23:48] take his crown away
[23:51] [Music]
[23:52] he's more mighty than the mightiest
[23:56] he reigns from above
[24:01] he's the all time undisputed
[24:06] undefeated champion
[24:09] of love
[24:13] he
[24:14] left his hometown
[24:16] to enter this arena
[24:19] to raise his hands in victory
[24:23] for you
[24:24] and for me
[24:26] an angry cried crowd crucify this king
[24:32] who bore the crown
[24:34] and they gladly watched the champion
[24:37] going down
[24:41] but i will never count him out
[24:44] for i'm a witness of
[24:48] the day he arose to retain the title
[24:53] champion of love
[24:56] he is higher than the highest
[25:00] is greater than
[25:02] the grade
[25:03] no one could ever take his crown away
[25:10] he's more mighty than the mightiest he
[25:14] reigns from above
[25:18] he's the all-time
[25:21] undisputed
[25:23] undefeated champion
[25:25] of love would you sing it with me
[25:29] he's higher than
[25:30] the highest
[25:32] he's greater than
[25:34] the grave
[25:35] no one could ever take his crown away
[25:42] he's more mighty than the mightiest he
[25:46] reigns from above
[25:50] he's the all time
[25:52] undisputed
[25:54] undefeated champion
[25:58] of
[25:59] love
[26:00] praise his name
[26:10] i wonder if there's a song sister
[26:12] literally doesn't know
[26:15] does it have to be probably a spanish
[26:17] song that she's never heard
[26:20] appreciate the musicians helping him
[26:23] [Applause]
[26:25] i mentioned to her they were going to
[26:27] put her to the test and she was up to it
[26:29] so
[26:30] amen shall
[26:32] um
[26:33] let's see who our sister amelia you said
[26:36] you had a song
[26:38] and brother ed dougal has the microphone
[26:41] back there if you would just like to
[26:42] give a testimony or praise but not
[26:44] necessarily want to come up front we can
[26:47] also take
[26:48] if you just want to say i love the lord
[26:50] jesus
[26:51] it'll be with him i'll say sister maddy

[27:56] my way
[27:58] as we're crossing over jordan i can say
[28:04] now i have
[28:06] better

[28:23] fully whole

[28:26] everlasting joy within my soul

[29:16] he made me fully whole with that
[29:21] everlasting joy within my soul
[29:26] i've heard the prophet's message i
[29:30] placed it in my heart

[29:36] that never shall depart
[29:40] the rapture is upon us the stage is said
[29:45] to go
[29:46] we have this precious promise
[29:50] [Music]
[30:16] in my soul

[30:29] i like that
[30:31] looking not looking for this city but in
[30:33] the city where the lamb is the light if

[30:37] the city where the lamb is the light
[30:39] sister martha few and the girls would be
[30:43] [Music]
[30:45] there's a country far beyond the starry
[30:48] sky
[30:50] there's a city where there never comes a
[30:54] night
[30:56] if we're faithful we shall go thereby

[43:20] i was waiting for my daughter abby to
[43:21] get here
[43:24] the last time we they were all here and
[43:26] i said oh that all the garage girls are
[43:27] here
[43:28] and we can call them all up to sing
[43:31] and they all walked out
[43:33] and they didn't come in for a while so i
[43:35] was getting a bit nervous but they were
[43:37] practicing the song getting the key
[43:38] ready so
[43:40] i sent abby a text and let her know what
[43:42] we were doing today and she said
[43:44] don't call on me dad because i'll turn
[43:47] out and round out the door
[43:49] and i said good we'll turn the video
[43:50] cameras up and we'll catch that
[43:53] and she says oh they'll just see a
[43:54] little ball of dust headed on its way to
[43:56] mexico
[43:58] and i said we'll take a bath it'll be a
[43:59] clean getaway
[44:01] this is the kind of what i do with my
[44:03] girls so and they expect it and i'll
[44:06] hear about it later so
[44:08] i said
[44:10] she has a song here
[44:13] i just wanted to make a comment here
[44:15] about this one this one we all know
[44:16] great is thy faithfulness
[44:18] um it's always
[44:21] uh strange to me how life can turn so
[44:24] quickly and suddenly and the last couple
[44:26] of months have been extremely difficult
[44:28] i had the surgery in august thank god
[44:30] that went well i'm good my catheter's
[44:32] working lots to be thankful for
[44:34] in that lots of trials but what i
[44:37] realized through this time is always how
[44:41] we can bank on the lord because he is
[44:43] faithful if he wasn't faithful we
[44:45] wouldn't have anything to hold on to at
[44:46] all
[44:47] but he's faithful and because of that we
[44:49] can come to him time time time again
[44:51] and he is that steady rock
[44:54] anchor
[44:56] so if you've seen this with me as well
[45:00] [Music]
[45:19] great is thy faithfulness
[45:24] oh god
[45:26] my father
[45:29] there is no shadow
[45:33] of
[45:34] turning with thee
[45:39] thou
[45:39] [Music]

[45:55] forever will be

[56:05] he's going to narrate it also so
[56:07] we can do that as this time
[56:12] i do it from back there
[56:14] okay
[56:16] it's good to worship the lord
[56:18] that's good to to honor him in song in
[56:21] praise and testimony
[56:24] just just to say i love the lord jesus
[56:26] he's been so good to me and
[56:29] just uh
[56:31] i i think that she's the only one i'm
[56:33] saying with so naomi you're next
[56:39] some of the girls have learned to say no
[56:48] well actually brother green or brother
[56:50] aaron kind of asked me to say share some
[56:52] of this
[56:53] um
[56:54] we don't probably talk a lot about what
[56:56] we do you can put that up brother peter
[56:58] if you want we don't talk a lot probably
[57:01] about what we do mission wise here at
[57:03] the church but
[57:04] we do
[57:05] do some missions and we've been doing
[57:07] more
[57:08] and so these are just some things that
[57:10] we've done just real recently that i
[57:12] just thought i would share
[57:13] um i we shared it with the brothers this
[57:16] is just a quote from brother branham i
[57:18] thought was real
[57:19] nice
[57:20] he says so i've watched for something if
[57:22] that be so when it's later then it's
[57:24] later than you think if not then there's
[57:27] coming one with a message that's
[57:29] straight on the bible and a quick work
[57:31] will circle the earth the seeds will go
[57:34] in newspapers reading material until
[57:36] every predestinated seed of god has
[57:38] heard it none of them will come
[57:40] unless the fathers drawed them and
[57:43] everyone the father has drawed will hear
[57:45] it and come that'll be the predestinated
[57:47] seed
[57:48] we'll hear the word
[57:52] we there were some pictures that brother
[57:54] berry coffee had requested that we had
[57:55] here at the church and we sent a couple
[57:58] hundred uh when we were back east we
[58:00] took them there by his by his place and
[58:02] he sent them um he's been doing a lot of
[58:05] work with the different brothers and so
[58:06] forth overseas and the place he had
[58:09] decided to send these uh photos was to
[58:11] malawi and it's just a little place here
[58:13] in east africa and this was just
[58:15] something i just wanted to kind of
[58:16] highlight this is something brother
[58:17] green and sister sandra you know had
[58:19] been real big into you know having and
[58:21] providing these photos
[58:23] and sometimes you don't think much about
[58:25] a photo
[58:26] but you know brother branham talks about
[58:28] if you put you know the little boy that
[58:30] had the sail the boat in his room and
[58:32] the ocean and he grew up and became a
[58:34] sailor and sometimes you know we have
[58:36] all these other things in our home
[58:37] whatever they may be or maybe it's
[58:39] nothing or just sayings or or whatever
[58:41] something from cracker barrel saying or
[58:44] something but i thought how many times
[58:46] do we want to have something that's you
[58:47] know the lord jesus you know a picture
[58:49] or or the pillar of fire or something
[58:52] like that so when we sent these photos
[58:54] to
[58:55] brother barry and took him over to him
[58:58] he
[59:00] don't sent them to africa malawi is
[59:03] where he wanted them to go the center
[59:05] color photo we didn't provide he's
[59:07] printing those at about 10 000 at a time
[59:11] but the ones in the black and white
[59:13] which we had left over those original
[59:15] kind of black and white ones is the ones
[59:17] we had sent over there uh or sent to him
[59:20] to send over and so you can just see the
[59:22] different the brothers and sisters that
[59:24] are just excited to have these and
[59:26] you'll see just the different kind of
[59:28] locations they're at when they get them
[59:31] and and kind of what what it means and
[59:33] special to them there's a couple videos
[59:35] here that'll just uh let you hear this
[59:38] video i hope the audio is okay if it
[59:39] isn't we'll just skip it but we'll just
[59:41] see how this how this audio works here
[59:43] on this
[59:56] he's a very well established pastor
[59:59] in this part of the country
[1:00:04] and i would like to just have to just
[1:00:07] have a little bit of time
[1:00:11] let him express
[1:00:12] for himself
[1:00:24] how long have you been a pastor
[1:00:28] for over 23 years in this part of
[1:00:31] the country southern malawi
[1:00:34] in the lower
[1:00:35] over 23 years that's right
[1:00:38] and how many cyber churches have you got
[1:00:40] we've got 13
[1:00:42] supply chains
[1:00:45] and they're still waking up
[1:00:47] you have 13 satellite churches
[1:00:50] and you are still evangelizing sure that
[1:00:53] means

[1:01:01] established yet but people are coming
[1:01:03] from there to go into this satellite

[1:06:43] well i was gonna well that's loud
[1:06:46] i was gonna say this when we got up to
[1:06:48] sing but i'll just say it now um
[1:06:51] when sarah was talking about the lord
[1:06:53] being so faithful
[1:06:54] um i quit my job
[1:06:57] two and a half years ago
[1:06:58] thinking i would just find another one
[1:07:01] and
[1:07:02] you know take a break while i didn't
[1:07:03] know
[1:07:05] that the pandemic would happen and that
[1:07:07] i would have serious health issues and
[1:07:10] be unable to work now
[1:07:12] it's been two and a half years
[1:07:15] and
[1:07:16] out of nowhere
[1:07:18] people started asking if they could
[1:07:20] order cookies from me
[1:07:22] and it just started a business and
[1:07:25] i look and i think
[1:07:28] i don't know how my needs are going to
[1:07:30] be met but the lord has been so faithful
[1:07:33] and
[1:07:34] i was showing my mom a couple days ago
[1:07:36] all the orders i have and this is not a
[1:07:38] shameless business plug
[1:07:40] but um all the orders i have lined up
[1:07:43] and i was like
[1:07:44] god you're so good to me
[1:07:47] you
[1:07:48] are so good to me you've you've kept
[1:07:50] your word and you've supplied all my
[1:07:53] needs
[1:07:54] and i just thank you for that
[1:07:56] and another little thing i told some
[1:07:59] people but
[1:08:00] it just meant a lot to me um
[1:08:05] asher and chloe like to come to my
[1:08:07] sunday school room so i do a little
[1:08:08] sunday school with them
[1:08:10] sunday nights and abel comes and we just
[1:08:13] do a little
[1:08:15] i simplify that day's lesson for them
[1:08:17] and
[1:08:19] my lesson had been on the church in the
[1:08:22] book of acts
[1:08:23] how do we look like that church what do
[1:08:25] we do that they did
[1:08:27] and i was talking about how we are the
[1:08:29] church and how we are the church
[1:08:32] to each other and so the kids were
[1:08:34] telling me
[1:08:35] different ways that we
[1:08:37] help each other
[1:08:39] and one of them says well we pray for
[1:08:41] each other and abel tells me i have a
[1:08:44] stuffy nose and i said oh are you asking
[1:08:46] for us to pray he's like yeah and i was
[1:08:48] like well he immediately recognized
[1:08:51] that's what we do i can go to you when i
[1:08:53] need prayer
[1:08:55] so we all held hands and i began praying
[1:08:59] and i hear asher next to me and he's
[1:09:02] three
[1:09:03] i hear him next to me
[1:09:05] and he is not repeating my prayer but he
[1:09:08] is praying on his own just crying out to
[1:09:10] the lord for abel lord would you touch
[1:09:13] abel would you heal him and he's just on
[1:09:16] his own just heartfelt praying
[1:09:19] and it moved me because i'm like they're
[1:09:22] three and four and they instantly got
[1:09:24] our little lesson
[1:09:26] and put it into practice right there
[1:09:29] and i could barely finish the prayer i
[1:09:31] was like try not to cry but it just so
[1:09:35] moved me
[1:09:36] to feel like the lord has
[1:09:39] a-blessed me with this sunday school
[1:09:41] class but just to see
[1:09:44] it continuing on in the lives of these
[1:09:46] little ones so it just really encouraged
[1:09:49] me
[1:09:51] abe
[1:09:53] amen then to see sister martha with her
[1:09:55] daughter singing up here
[1:09:58] you know you you go out and maybe your
[1:10:00] neighbors or somebody doesn't know and
[1:10:02] the kids are doing things that
[1:10:04] you go oh my
[1:10:05] if those kids grow up to go in that type
[1:10:07] of life what will they be
[1:10:09] but to see the blessing that we get to
[1:10:11] have our children
[1:10:12] raise in the admonition of the lord and
[1:10:15] begin to do those things amen now i know
[1:10:17] some of my other girls were going to
[1:10:19] sing
[1:10:20] so if they'd make ready
[1:10:24] anybody else that has a testimony just
[1:10:26] something they'd like to share something

[1:11:05] all of a sudden this
[1:11:07] it happened twice
[1:11:09] this woman just
[1:11:13] ran by right in front of me if i had
[1:11:15] been going fast
[1:11:16] i probably would have hit her
[1:11:18] very you know and or she would have hit
[1:11:20] me or i would hit here but god protected
[1:11:23] me and i'm thankful to the lord because

[1:21:59] month he went in the middle of september
[1:22:02] with bleeding the doctors couldn't find
[1:22:04] where he was bleeding from
[1:22:06] they gave him several different
[1:22:11] scopes i guess looking for where the
[1:22:13] bleeding was coming from and they
[1:22:15] couldn't find the location he continued
[1:22:18] to have blood transfusions
[1:22:20] about every other day for six weeks
[1:22:23] finally the doctor told my daughter
[1:22:25] where he lives up in phoenix
[1:22:28] i'm sorry we've done everything we can
[1:22:31] just take him home and
[1:22:35] as we quit giving him blood transfusions
[1:22:39] he'll die
[1:22:40] so we called our son that lives in new
[1:22:42] hampshire
[1:22:43] and joseph came out in november
[1:22:46] jeffrey was released from the hospital
[1:22:49] and we were going to have our last
[1:22:50] supper a thanks early thanksgiving with
[1:22:53] jeffrey
[1:22:54] so he came from from the hospital
[1:22:57] on i don't know friday or saturday and
[1:23:00] we had the big thanksgiving dinner
[1:23:02] on saturday
[1:23:04] sunday morning we went to church and
[1:23:07] at the end of the service
[1:23:09] i noticed my
[1:23:11] grandson was wheeling jeffrey down to
[1:23:13] the front for prayer
[1:23:15] and they hadn't asked for prayer or
[1:23:17] anything
[1:23:18] but
[1:23:20] jeffrey didn't die
[1:23:22] fusions from the fluid retention
[1:23:25] and he started losing the weight
[1:23:28] and he's been fine for a year
[1:23:30] amen so this morning brother aaron when
[1:23:32] you said
[1:23:34] you knew that god healed
[1:23:37] your neighbor just doesn't know right
[1:23:39] but we serve a a god that heals
[1:23:43] and delivers and saves and we are so
[1:23:45] blessed

[1:29:20] brother dave you've got a testimony
[1:29:21] you'd like to share
[1:29:27] wait did i get your name wrong
[1:29:39] yeah
[1:29:40] the pilot
[1:29:43] come on it
[1:29:46] you're the only pilot here
[1:29:50] maybe share a little bit of what the
[1:29:51] lord has done for you in in what you do
[1:29:55] some of us who've always wanted to do
[1:29:56] some of those things never been able to
[1:29:58] thank god for that
[1:30:03] i think everybody has a testimony you
[1:30:05] know
[1:30:06] and
[1:30:08] i'm not one to get up in front and yeah
[1:30:11] uh talk or
[1:30:13] this kind of thing but um
[1:30:18] you we speak of healing
[1:30:20] you know
[1:30:21] and
[1:30:23] sometimes
[1:30:26] a testimony isn't so much in the healing
[1:30:29] that you would you would like to have
[1:30:31] you know um
[1:30:34] so
[1:30:35] i don't know like 13 years ago
[1:30:38] i uh
[1:30:40] i was always fairly active you know and
[1:30:44] we would
[1:30:45] um get out me and sharon would get out
[1:30:48] with the young kids and and play you
[1:30:50] know volleyball and different things and
[1:30:52] we were playing
[1:30:53] uh frisbee frisbee um
[1:30:55] uh
[1:30:56] cameron it's a it's a kind of a frisbee
[1:30:58] game you know ultimate frisbee
[1:31:01] and so
[1:31:02] we're out there and um
[1:31:06] and i'm just playing with a bunch of 12
[1:31:07] year olds you know in in
[1:31:10] but i mean i'm playing like i'm 30 you
[1:31:12] know because i'm not going to have 12
[1:31:13] year olds beat me you know
[1:31:15] and so
[1:31:16] we're playing frisbee and i jump i put
[1:31:18] everything i got into this this jump and
[1:31:20] i
[1:31:21] you know get up there and i try to go
[1:31:23] for this and when i came back down
[1:31:26] uh the top of my leg fell off the bottom
[1:31:28] of my leg you know so my my knee just
[1:31:30] kind of
[1:31:31] separated like this
[1:31:34] and
[1:31:36] i it's been a constant
[1:31:39] uh reminder of how i'm not the same
[1:31:42] anymore you know
[1:31:43] and we would look at that and be like oh
[1:31:45] that's not a very good testimony you
[1:31:47] know
[1:31:49] but
[1:31:51] when i look back i knew
[1:31:54] i can kind of see
[1:31:56] hindsight's 2020 and you can kind of
[1:31:58] look back and and maybe see
[1:32:00] it's tough when you
[1:32:02] in the moment
[1:32:03] thanking god for like a trial you know
[1:32:07] and those aren't like the cool
[1:32:08] testimonies
[1:32:10] uh
[1:32:11] you know but i can look back and
[1:32:13] unfortunately
[1:32:15] um
[1:32:16] i was fairly athletic and i i kind of
[1:32:19] i was thinking man i'm pretty you know
[1:32:21] pretty squared away here you know and i
[1:32:24] think that was his way of
[1:32:27] maybe correcting that a little
[1:32:29] you know
[1:32:30] so it's unfortunate that uh
[1:32:33] it's unfortunate that i needed that
[1:32:35] lesson you know but um i thank god just
[1:32:38] the same
[1:32:39] you know and so
[1:32:41] some of our
[1:32:43] testimonies are um
[1:32:46] uh
[1:32:47] we still you know there's kind of
[1:32:49] uh silver linings and clouds and things
[1:32:53] you know i you have to go through pt
[1:32:55] tests and i still have somewhat of an
[1:32:57] active job
[1:32:59] and different things you know that it
[1:33:01] has never held me back i've never failed
[1:33:03] a pt test
[1:33:05] whenever i've needed it i've had my knee
[1:33:08] now i haven't been able to
[1:33:13] show off maybe as much as i would like
[1:33:17] but
[1:33:18] that's probably for the better anyway so
[1:33:21] it's a testimony in some in a little way
[1:33:24] i have another one actually
[1:33:26] um
[1:33:27] so
[1:33:28] uh
[1:33:30] testimonies probably mean more to
[1:33:32] yourself than than other people because
[1:33:34] you're not the one in you know in the
[1:33:36] the situation and you don't
[1:33:38] um
[1:33:39] so
[1:33:41] i forget exactly
[1:33:43] what it was that that happened to him
[1:33:44] but
[1:33:45] andrew had something in and he
[1:33:48] scratched his eye pretty bad
[1:33:51] maybe it was several months ago almost a
[1:33:53] year ago maybe
[1:33:55] um and it was one of those things where
[1:33:57] i mean just
[1:33:59] just i mean
[1:34:00] a centimeter of difference would have
[1:34:03] could have cost an eye and things like
[1:34:05] that and he's just he's more active than
[1:34:07] i was you know he's more athletic than i
[1:34:10] used to be you know and so
[1:34:14] man my heart would almost just break
[1:34:15] because i feel like
[1:34:17] i know what
[1:34:19] it's like to have something taken away
[1:34:21] even for
[1:34:23] for the good
[1:34:26] but you never want to see that for
[1:34:28] somebody else you
[1:34:30] know maybe you go through things
[1:34:33] sometimes too
[1:34:37] so that you can
[1:34:38] kind of feel for other people you know
[1:34:42] so
[1:34:43] everyone's got a testimony
[1:34:48] [Applause]
[1:34:52] if we only knew how many times god
[1:34:54] watched over us
[1:34:56] things that could have been
[1:34:58] i have a pair of sunglasses i haven't
[1:35:00] thrown away but there's a scratch on him
[1:35:02] from top to bottom
[1:35:04] that when the camper shell came down the
[1:35:05] sunglasses took him
[1:35:07] but it would have been my eyeball
[1:35:09] had it not been
[1:35:11] and unfortunately the older we get it
[1:35:13] seems the slower we react
[1:35:17] the harder we fall
[1:35:19] that's just just don't seem to be a roll
[1:35:21] away from some of the things now
[1:35:23] but god's been good to us
[1:35:26] yesterday or i guess it was friday i was
[1:35:29] doing some work and
[1:35:30] they have the uh rebar that they put up
[1:35:33] and they put the orange caps on top of
[1:35:35] them now so if somebody falls
[1:35:38] they don't impale themselves
[1:35:40] and as i was walking into the house i
[1:35:42] saw the young man putting those on and
[1:35:44] it reminded me
[1:35:46] that if it wasn't for the orange cab i
[1:35:48] would have had a gash in my leg back
[1:35:50] here quite deep and probably would have
[1:35:52] required surgery
[1:35:54] i turned slipped and fell right on it
[1:35:58] and being the young man that i am i
[1:36:00] quickly recovered in about a week
[1:36:02] now
[1:36:03] uh
[1:36:05] i got up as quick as i could and looked
[1:36:06] around and said who saw me
[1:36:09] that's all i was worried about till i
[1:36:11] got home i've got a scar probably about
[1:36:14] four inches long
[1:36:16] a couple inches wide where that orange
[1:36:18] cap ripped the skin off
[1:36:21] but if the orange cap hadn't been there
[1:36:24] i probably would have had to go have my
[1:36:25] leg repaired
[1:36:27] and i saw that orange cap and i said
[1:36:29] thank you lord because that orange cap
[1:36:30] was on there
[1:36:32] sometimes
[1:36:34] we don't realize how god takes care of
[1:36:35] us
[1:36:36] and he does he's mindful of us
[1:36:38] now
[1:36:40] brother lyle and sister heather have a
[1:36:42] song
[1:36:43] and brother lyle also has some things he
[1:36:45] would like to share with us for a few
[1:36:47] minutes and maybe we'll we'll end on
[1:36:49] that so let's stand
[1:36:52] and let's just sing brother brandon
[1:36:54] called it the bride song
[1:36:56] it's amazing grace and
[1:36:58] it really became real to me
[1:37:03] when we went to my uncle's funeral my
[1:37:05] dad's one of my dad's younger brothers
[1:37:09] who had gotten cancer
[1:37:11] and he had began to listen to the
[1:37:13] message
[1:37:14] he had been pentecostal began to listen
[1:37:16] to the message
[1:37:18] and he had told my dad when as soon as
[1:37:19] god heals me i'm moving to tucson
[1:37:22] and i'm going to go be with you
[1:37:25] so
[1:37:26] they called my dad and told dad if you
[1:37:28] want to see your brother alive you
[1:37:30] better come
[1:37:32] dad got to see him but he passed away
[1:37:34] soon after that i went with dad
[1:37:36] back to the funeral in california the
[1:37:38] memorial service
[1:37:40] and he had belonged to a pentecostal
[1:37:42] church that we had been raised in and
[1:37:46] the minister got up and he ministered
[1:37:48] and he said we don't know where our
[1:37:50] brother john is today because he left
[1:37:52] our pentecostal church
[1:37:55] and we're not sure where he's at today
[1:37:59] and
[1:38:00] you know
[1:38:01] there was an assurance in me and my
[1:38:02] father where he was
[1:38:05] but the people got real quiet
[1:38:08] and the minister of the church was a
[1:38:09] very good friend a pastor a good friend
[1:38:11] of ours growing up with them
[1:38:13] he got up and he was embarrassed he kind
[1:38:15] of looked at us and he was very
[1:38:17] embarrassed and he said well
[1:38:19] i don't really know about that
[1:38:21] but he goes let's sing
[1:38:23] brother john's favorite song
[1:38:26] and they begin to sing amazing grace
[1:38:29] and brother brown said that's the bride
[1:38:31] song amazing grace it was a confirmation
[1:38:34] to me and my dad that everything was
[1:38:36] okay
[1:38:37] maybe they didn't understand but god
[1:38:39] being mindful of us
[1:38:41] had a signature
[1:38:45] [Music]
[1:38:49] how sweet
[1:38:51] [Music]
[1:39:09] but
[1:39:10] now
[1:39:16] [Music]
[1:39:20] and if you've lived a few years you can
[1:39:22] sing a song
[1:39:24] through
[1:39:27] many dangers
[1:39:29] [Music]
[1:39:34] i have
[1:39:37] already
[1:39:39] [Music]
[1:39:44] his
[1:39:45] grace as god
[1:39:49] may save
[1:39:51] us
[1:39:56] [Music]
[1:40:03] when we've
[1:40:06] been there
[1:40:08] ten thousand
[1:40:15] shine as
[1:40:18] the sun
[1:40:21] [Music]
[1:40:37] now let's praise him he's worthy of all
[1:40:40] place
[1:40:42] praise
[1:40:43] god praise god
[1:40:47] praise god
[1:40:49] praise lord
[1:40:51] praise god
[1:40:54] praise
[1:40:55] god praise god
[1:41:00] praise
[1:41:02] god praise god
[1:41:05] praise
[1:41:07] god
[1:41:08] [Music]
[1:41:10] praise god
[1:41:13] praise god
[1:41:18] amen brother lyle sister heather
[1:41:22] you may be seated thank you
[1:41:33] [Music]
[1:41:41] i think we found one that she didn't
[1:41:43] know
[1:41:45] and and i'm certain that the key that i
[1:41:47] sing in is one that's not part of the
[1:41:49] piano
[1:41:51] but this particular song
[1:41:53] and i shouldn't say she doesn't know
[1:41:55] because she had their practice
[1:41:57] a little bit this afternoon that's the
[1:41:58] one yep
[1:41:59] but this song is about the third exodus
[1:42:02] and i first heard it and maybe the only
[1:42:04] time i ever heard it was in
[1:42:07] the easter meetings at random tabernacle
[1:42:09] in 1974
[1:42:12] and sister rebecca smith sang this song
[1:42:16] and i
[1:42:17] wrote the words down
[1:42:19] and uh
[1:42:20] i've looked around i haven't found it on
[1:42:22] the internet doesn't mean it's not there
[1:42:24] it just means that i don't know how to
[1:42:25] search very well on the internet
[1:42:27] probably but this song
[1:42:30] should be a real encouragement to us
[1:42:33] it's a it's a song that's basically
[1:42:35] saying in my mind
[1:42:37] keep your eyes on jesus don't lose sight
[1:42:39] of the gold
[1:42:40] keep your eye on the ball keep going
[1:42:43] don't give up
[1:42:45] it's it's uh i think it's called the
[1:42:47] third exodus that's what i called it
[1:42:49] anyway
[1:42:50] [Music]
[1:42:53] in the days of old king pharaoh god's
[1:42:57] people were enslaved in bondage to that
[1:43:01] wicked king till they laid down in the
[1:43:04] grave
[1:43:05] they cried to god in heaven our lord is
[1:43:09] hard to bear
[1:43:12] then said moses thus saith god
[1:43:15] and showed the lord's almighty
[1:43:17] [Music]
[1:43:24] work on
[1:43:27] it won't be long
[1:43:30] there's just one more
[1:43:34] exodus
[1:43:36] god's gonna lift your heavy load
[1:43:42] god changed the water into blood
[1:43:45] darkness filled the land
[1:43:47] and all the wicked felt the touch of the
[1:43:51] lord's almighty hand
[1:43:53] all egypt lost their firstborn death
[1:43:57] took king pharaoh's son
[1:44:00] then he let god's people go
[1:44:03] that was exodus number one
[1:44:06] we're gone
[1:44:08] there's a crowd away
[1:44:10] [Music]
[1:44:12] press on
[1:44:14] to victory
[1:44:17] there's one more
[1:44:20] exodus coming
[1:44:23] god's gonna set his people free
[1:44:28] by a pillar of fire he led them to the
[1:44:31] distant promised land their god himself
[1:44:35] would be made flesh and live amongst
[1:44:37] them as a man
[1:44:40] he walked the road to calvary he rose
[1:44:43] again that's true
[1:44:45] then sent to us the holy ghost that was
[1:44:50] exodus number two
[1:44:55] [Music]
[1:45:14] come out of her my people
[1:45:17] was the eagle cry we heard as elijah to
[1:45:21] this last church age turn the hearts
[1:45:23] back to the word he knew his days were
[1:45:27] numbered so food for us he stored and
[1:45:31] warned us to seek perfect love
[1:45:34] apply the token to your door look up
[1:45:40] the savior's coming
[1:45:42] [Music]
[1:45:54] to
[1:45:55] begin the jubilee

[1:46:01] the savior's coming
[1:46:05] it is
[1:46:06] exodus number three
[1:46:10] what's gone on will soon be with us
[1:46:16] [Music]
[1:46:42] i see we're all practicing social
[1:46:44] distancing
[1:46:47] nobody up front except heather okay
[1:46:50] um
[1:46:54] i'd like to just pray for a moment
[1:46:56] together before i
[1:46:59] read the word
[1:47:01] lord jesus this has been such a
[1:47:03] privilege and an honor to be here
[1:47:04] amongst your people to hear testimonies
[1:47:06] to sing songs of worship and just to
[1:47:08] know that your presence is here with us
[1:47:10] lord and i pray that you'd help me in
[1:47:12] these few words that have been
[1:47:14] quickly prepared lord that they would
[1:47:17] have meaning and help
[1:47:19] those that are here lord we commit
[1:47:21] ourselves in this time again to you in
[1:47:23] jesus name
[1:47:26] well he started it
[1:47:28] she pushed my buttons
[1:47:31] we know how to provoke
[1:47:33] reactions
[1:47:34] anger
[1:47:35] retaliation
[1:47:38] we know how to allow differing opinions
[1:47:40] to divide us
[1:47:42] our nation is as divided and polarized
[1:47:44] now as i've ever seen it in my life
[1:47:47] most of today it's about hurt feelings
[1:47:49] and offenses
[1:47:50] not about wars or great social issues
[1:47:53] like slavery or persecution
[1:47:56] well the other day brother aaron settled
[1:47:58] email to peter and i
[1:48:00] and they asked if we might have an
[1:48:02] exhortation and
[1:48:04] well i feel that
[1:48:06] part of my mission here is to
[1:48:08] support and help brother aaron so i
[1:48:10] raised my hand and said sure
[1:48:13] then i thought
[1:48:14] what's an exhortation
[1:48:16] what what does that word even really
[1:48:18] mean does it mean to stand up and scold
[1:48:21] to preach
[1:48:23] to to assert to proclaim
[1:48:25] to punish
[1:48:27] no
[1:48:28] no the word exhortation
[1:48:30] means encouragement to exhort someone is
[1:48:33] to encourage them
[1:48:35] to do something
[1:48:37] if we could have the hebrews 10 brother
[1:48:44] so
[1:48:46] i got to digging into the message a bit
[1:48:49] and digging into the scriptures a bit
[1:48:52] and don't worry it looks like i have a
[1:48:54] lot of notes but that's multiple copies
[1:48:55] of the song it's this i'm not going to
[1:48:57] keep you tied up here
[1:49:00] but hebrews 10 i'm sorry i'm so used to
[1:49:02] having a a microphone attached
[1:49:06] well i'll try and stand still it's
[1:49:08] difficult for me but
[1:49:11] paul's talking here and he says
[1:49:14] let us consider one another
[1:49:17] and
[1:49:18] and we could also think of that as let's
[1:49:20] be considerate
[1:49:22] of one another
[1:49:24] thoughtfully
[1:49:25] how to provoke
[1:49:26] now we know how to provoke anger
[1:49:29] but how can we encourage
[1:49:31] how can we spur
[1:49:33] how can we motivate one another unto
[1:49:35] love
[1:49:36] and to good works
[1:49:38] good works things deeds acts
[1:49:42] that reflect that love
[1:49:48] 10 supposed to be 24 i'm sorry brother
[1:49:52] 24 and 25.
[1:49:56] yeah
[1:49:57] now you can follow along a little more
[1:49:59] easily
[1:50:00] verse 25 not forsaking the assembling of
[1:50:04] ourselves together
[1:50:05] this is the first church ages this is
[1:50:08] paul this is the very beginning and
[1:50:10] people are already well i'm not sure
[1:50:12] what they preach over there i'm gonna go
[1:50:13] somewhere else it it reminds me a little
[1:50:16] bit of the story that i heard
[1:50:18] a fellow was asked when he uh if he was
[1:50:20] you know abandoned on some desert island
[1:50:22] somewhere and we couldn't find anybody
[1:50:24] else what's the first thing you do build
[1:50:26] a fire put up a tent find shelter look
[1:50:28] for food no no i i'd start a church
[1:50:33] oh
[1:50:34] and what's the second thing that you do
[1:50:36] well i'd start another church
[1:50:38] well why would you do that well i might
[1:50:40] not like what they said at the first one
[1:50:43] so paul's dealing with this very same
[1:50:45] problem not forsaking the assembling of
[1:50:48] ourselves together meeting together for
[1:50:51] worship and instruction
[1:50:53] as a manner of some is
[1:50:55] but exhorting
[1:50:57] encouraging
[1:50:58] one another
[1:51:00] and so much the more
[1:51:02] faithfully
[1:51:04] especially now as you see the day of
[1:51:07] christ's return
[1:51:09] approaching
[1:51:12] if we could go to colossians 3.
[1:51:17] starting at verse 12
[1:51:19] so
[1:51:28] yes sorry about that i've i've got a
[1:51:31] different translation here in my notes
[1:51:33] put on therefore
[1:51:35] as the elect of god those who've been
[1:51:37] chosen of god
[1:51:38] holy and beloved do you know
[1:51:42] that you are beloved of god
[1:51:45] you are his beloved the price that he
[1:51:49] paid
[1:51:50] and he paid that price
[1:51:52] because
[1:51:53] you're his beloved
[1:51:57] holy and beloved put on
[1:51:59] this isn't put on like like a
[1:52:02] like an actor puts on and pretends to be
[1:52:05] something else but it's but it's clothe
[1:52:07] yourselves with
[1:52:10] a heart of compassion
[1:52:12] tender hearted mercy
[1:52:15] kindness
[1:52:17] humility
[1:52:19] god's no respecter of persons there's no
[1:52:21] big eyes and little use
[1:52:23] we're all at the same level
[1:52:26] clothe yourself with that humility
[1:52:29] clothe yourselves with that gentleness
[1:52:32] and that patience humbleness of mind
[1:52:34] meekness long suffering
[1:52:37] for bearing one another
[1:52:40] bearing with one another it means to
[1:52:42] make allowance for each other's faults
[1:52:45] we're not all the same
[1:52:48] and forgiving one another
[1:52:51] forgiving one another
[1:52:55] if any man have a quarrel
[1:52:58] against any not just with your brothers
[1:53:00] and sisters not just somebody in church
[1:53:03] not some philosophical or doctrinal
[1:53:05] disagreement
[1:53:07] anyone
[1:53:08] anyone who has a complaint forgiving
[1:53:11] anyone
[1:53:12] who offends you
[1:53:14] even as or just as christ forgave you
[1:53:19] so also do ye that's not a request
[1:53:23] that's a commandment
[1:53:25] we're encouraged to do that to forgive
[1:53:30] um i don't know i i happened to stumble
[1:53:32] across a news article the other day that
[1:53:35] that in the last several days in haiti
[1:53:37] 17 missionaries
[1:53:40] were captured by a gang
[1:53:42] and they're holding them for a ransom
[1:53:44] they want a million dollars per person
[1:53:46] including there's a couple of little
[1:53:48] kids in that group
[1:53:50] and if they don't get the money they're
[1:53:52] threatening to kill them now these are
[1:53:55] amish and mennonite missionaries
[1:53:59] and what is their response to this is
[1:54:02] their response well where's the
[1:54:04] government where's the soldiers let's
[1:54:06] send in the police let's let's mount a
[1:54:08] rescue let's call in an air strike
[1:54:11] no
[1:54:12] no their response
[1:54:14] this gives us an opportunity to practice
[1:54:17] what our lord taught us to love our
[1:54:19] enemies
[1:54:20] to do good to them that despitefully use
[1:54:23] you and persecute you
[1:54:25] what would your response be
[1:54:28] what would mine be
[1:54:30] anger
[1:54:31] vengeance
[1:54:32] or love and prayer earnestly reaching
[1:54:35] out to the lord on behalf of not only
[1:54:37] those that have been captured
[1:54:39] but on their captors
[1:54:42] what a response i
[1:54:44] i wasn't sure how i felt about
[1:54:47] my witness and my testimony in that
[1:54:49] circumstance verse 14.
[1:54:52] paul says don't stop there
[1:54:55] no in addition
[1:54:57] to all these things above all these
[1:54:59] things
[1:55:01] we have more to do
[1:55:03] put on
[1:55:04] clothe yourselves
[1:55:06] another layer around gentleness and
[1:55:09] meekness and patience long-suffering
[1:55:12] kindness
[1:55:14] put a layer around that of love
[1:55:18] which is the bond of perfectness
[1:55:20] the perfect bond of unity
[1:55:23] it's the perfect glue
[1:55:25] that holds us together
[1:55:27] more than super glue
[1:55:29] more than gorilla glue it works even in
[1:55:33] the event of a nuclear detonation
[1:55:36] not persuasion
[1:55:38] not teaching not arguing
[1:55:41] but united
[1:55:43] in
[1:55:44] love god is love
[1:55:48] the love that must define us
[1:55:51] brother branham spoke often about having
[1:55:53] what he called
[1:55:54] perfect love he says without that
[1:55:57] he can't get there
[1:55:59] and that's what i want
[1:56:01] and i know that's what you want
[1:56:05] and it's available to us
[1:56:09] how
[1:56:10] paul says let the peace of god rule in
[1:56:13] your heart let it
[1:56:15] it's there
[1:56:17] he's saying get out of the way and allow
[1:56:19] it
[1:56:20] you can't manufacture it
[1:56:22] but accept it
[1:56:24] the peace of god that comes from christ
[1:56:27] to which you were also called in one
[1:56:30] body
[1:56:32] to rule in your hearts
[1:56:35] a parallel to this would be if your
[1:56:37] immune system attacks your own body
[1:56:40] crippling you and making you ineffective
[1:56:43] i have a friend that several years ago a
[1:56:45] fellow that i used to work with and he
[1:56:47] got out of bed one morning and fell on
[1:56:48] the floor
[1:56:50] he couldn't get up turned out he had a
[1:56:52] thing they call guillain-barre syndrome
[1:56:54] it's where your immune system attacks
[1:56:56] your nervous system and his legs stopped
[1:56:59] working a lot of him stopped working
[1:57:01] and he
[1:57:02] over a period of time gradually
[1:57:04] recovered a lot of that he still walks
[1:57:06] with a cane but he's able to get up and
[1:57:08] walk for months he was using a walker
[1:57:10] healthy guy in his early 40s but his
[1:57:13] immune system attacked his nervous
[1:57:15] system
[1:57:17] but we're called to be one body
[1:57:19] one body in christ and and and
[1:57:22] colossians here this is a group of
[1:57:23] people paul had never met but he said
[1:57:26] be thankful
[1:57:27] be thankful
[1:57:29] and we need to be thankful and i want to
[1:57:31] encourage you
[1:57:33] to please
[1:57:34] be thankful
[1:57:37] go ahead and
[1:57:38] blank that
[1:57:40] you know there there used to be a plaque
[1:57:43] as you came into the church
[1:57:45] from the vestibule hanging between the
[1:57:47] two main doors of the entry there
[1:57:50] it was it was an abridged meaning
[1:57:52] slightly edited grammarized if you will
[1:57:55] from christ is a mystery of god revealed
[1:57:57] that brother branham preached in july of
[1:58:00] 1963
[1:58:02] and because this is supposed to be a
[1:58:03] short exhortation i'm going to close
[1:58:05] with this quote
[1:58:09] but it said
[1:58:11] love
[1:58:12] one another
[1:58:14] how important was that above everything
[1:58:18] above your doctrinal understanding
[1:58:20] against everything else
[1:58:22] is above everything he said love
[1:58:24] one another no matter what the devil
[1:58:28] tries to say
[1:58:30] now you're all one great big sweet group
[1:58:34] now
[1:58:35] but remember my warning
[1:58:37] see
[1:58:38] satan won't let you stay that way no sir
[1:58:40] he'll shoot everything if he has to
[1:58:42] bring somebody in to make his target
[1:58:44] he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in
[1:58:47] set him down
[1:58:49] cause him to fellowship with you under
[1:58:50] the quietness and things then he'll
[1:58:52] shoot that guy with some kind of poison
[1:58:54] stuff
[1:58:54] and he'll start through the church with
[1:58:56] it
[1:58:58] don't you take sides with it
[1:59:00] don't you have nothing to do with
[1:59:02] anything else you stay right loving and
[1:59:06] sweet and kind to one another
[1:59:10] pray for that man that he'll be safe too
[1:59:12] or that woman whoever it is
[1:59:15] pray for them and stick with one another
[1:59:18] and stay with your pastor
[1:59:20] i i just reminded
[1:59:24] when we heard that song in april of
[1:59:27] 1974 or march whenever easter was in 74.
[1:59:31] heather and i through a strange set of
[1:59:32] circumstances wound up being invited
[1:59:34] into brother neville's home and brother
[1:59:36] neville spent about an hour an hour and
[1:59:38] a half visiting with us and sharing with
[1:59:41] us and
[1:59:42] and he was a pastor and so he was
[1:59:44] ministering to us
[1:59:46] uh it was it was just a wonderful time
[1:59:49] and that's the context of that of course
[1:59:51] that for us now is brother aaron
[1:59:54] he's taken on that role and that
[1:59:56] responsibility for five of the last six
[1:59:58] years regardless of votes trials so
[2:00:01] forth i know i've gone to meddling but
[2:00:04] i'm not going to apologize for he says
[2:00:06] stick with your pastor see he's the
[2:00:08] shepherd you give him respects
[2:00:11] he'll lead you through
[2:00:13] because he's ordained of god to do so
[2:00:16] now you remember that
[2:00:18] the enemy will come and when he does
[2:00:20] just cling that much closer together
[2:00:24] and the one that the devil is using for
[2:00:26] an enemy will either get out or come in
[2:00:28] and be one of you
[2:00:29] that's all
[2:00:31] don't never clan among one another or
[2:00:34] talk or make yourself clannish
[2:00:37] we're one
[2:00:38] i i couldn't say left hand i'm mad at
[2:00:41] you i'm going to take you away because
[2:00:42] you're not a right hand
[2:00:44] he's my left hand
[2:00:45] i want him to stay there even the little
[2:00:47] tip of my finger i want it to stay right
[2:00:49] there
[2:00:51] every little part of my body stay right
[2:00:53] there god wants us
[2:00:55] as a body of believers to stay right
[2:00:58] exactly
[2:00:59] with one another
[2:01:01] write it with one another
[2:01:05] now you've got tapes on that you've got
[2:01:07] tapes on what we believe we've got tapes
[2:01:09] on discipline in the church how we be
[2:01:11] saved behave ourselves when the church
[2:01:12] of god how we come here set together set
[2:01:15] in heavenly places
[2:01:17] he says
[2:01:18] don't stay home
[2:01:21] if god is in your heart
[2:01:23] it's what we just read you can't hardly
[2:01:26] wait for them doors to open out yonder
[2:01:28] to get in here to fellowship with your
[2:01:30] brothers
[2:01:31] if you don't feel that way
[2:01:34] then i tell you
[2:01:35] it's time you got to praying
[2:01:37] because we're in the last days where the
[2:01:40] bible exhorted us
[2:01:42] to much more
[2:01:44] as we see that day approaching that's
[2:01:46] what we just read from the first church
[2:01:48] age to love one another with christian
[2:01:52] love and divine love brother branham
[2:01:54] called it perfect love to assemble
[2:01:57] ourselves together in heavenly places in
[2:01:59] christ jesus and love one another
[2:02:03] this will all men know you're my
[2:02:05] disciples when you have love one for the
[2:02:07] other
[2:02:08] that's right
[2:02:09] stay right together
[2:02:11] if the brother you think he's a little
[2:02:13] wrong or sister or say
[2:02:15] lord
[2:02:16] don't let me ever have the root of
[2:02:19] bitterness spring up
[2:02:21] because it'll affect him
[2:02:23] and it'll take the christ
[2:02:25] right out of my life
[2:02:27] that poison acids of malice and jealousy
[2:02:31] and hatred
[2:02:33] that'll just take the holy spirit right
[2:02:35] away from you it'll run him from the
[2:02:37] tabernacle here it it'll kill the spirit
[2:02:39] of god or drive it away from here hurts
[2:02:41] your pastor it'll do everything
[2:02:43] see
[2:02:44] don't you do that
[2:02:46] you just wax that much closer together
[2:02:50] take the buckle as a brother testified a
[2:02:52] minister here the other night about
[2:02:53] having a buckle seeing it in a vision
[2:02:56] that buckles on the whole armor of god
[2:02:59] just put it on
[2:03:00] tighten up
[2:03:02] move right up close to one another
[2:03:05] love one another anyhow
[2:03:08] talk nice about one another say nice
[2:03:12] things about one another
[2:03:16] and then god will bless you
[2:03:19] we're going to bring the message now by
[2:03:21] god's grace brother branham goes into a
[2:03:23] word of prayer and i'll just read that
[2:03:24] prayer lord jesus
[2:03:26] speaking to this body of the church that
[2:03:28] they should hold together with god's
[2:03:30] unchanging hand
[2:03:32] their absolute the word
[2:03:35] warning them as paul warned his flock
[2:03:37] that there would be wolves that are in
[2:03:38] you're the same god today as you were
[2:03:40] then and that enemy is the same
[2:03:44] may this fellowship and bonds of love
[2:03:46] always exist amongst these people in
[2:03:48] christ jesus
[2:03:50] keep us together father
[2:03:52] let the holy spirit guide us
[2:03:55] and direct us give us long life of
[2:03:58] service for you
[2:04:00] give us this great message this morning
[2:04:02] we're expecting out of thy word it might
[2:04:04] go to each heart
[2:04:05] make the lips that speak lord speak
[2:04:07] truth
[2:04:08] may the heart that hears be fertile to
[2:04:10] receive truth
[2:04:12] and may it grow into great trees of
[2:04:14] eternal life to be shining lights and
[2:04:17] red epistles of all men they might know
[2:04:19] that jesus christ is raised from the
[2:04:21] dead
[2:04:22] and lives among us
[2:04:24] and he ends so make us so full of love
[2:04:28] and the fruit of the spirit
[2:04:30] until other men and women boys and girls
[2:04:33] can see the results of the life of
[2:04:35] christ
[2:04:36] still living in us after two thousand
[2:04:39] years from the great event
[2:04:41] granted father to honor thee we ask in
[2:04:43] jesus christ's name
[2:04:45] amen
[2:04:56] you can't argue with that
[2:05:00] because that wasn't just from any man or
[2:05:02] person that was god's servant speaking
[2:05:04] to us how we ought to love one another
[2:05:07] how we ought to treat one another
[2:05:10] now let me just say this say it this way
[2:05:13] it begins in each individual home
[2:05:16] how you treat one another how you
[2:05:18] respect one another how you love one
[2:05:20] another
[2:05:21] and then you bring that it's part of the
[2:05:23] body
[2:05:25] just because you walk in the
[2:05:26] the church door doesn't make you a
[2:05:29] perfect christian
[2:05:32] it's something that you live and you do
[2:05:34] every day amen
[2:05:35] let's stand
[2:05:39] you appreciate the word of the lord
[2:05:41] you appreciate god's mercy i enjoyed the
[2:05:44] worship i enjoyed the songs
[2:05:47] enjoyed this day today
[2:05:49] what god had for us amen
[2:05:52] lord we thank you
[2:05:56] as yesterday and even friday is
[2:05:58] preparing for this weekend and
[2:06:01] i said lord what what should we do
[2:06:03] you've placed something in my heart and
[2:06:05] i'll be able to minister that but what
[2:06:06] should we do
[2:06:08] i just thought just came on why don't we
[2:06:10] just have a time of worship and praise
[2:06:12] and singing
