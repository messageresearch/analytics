[54:24] which were in them
[54:25] and they were judged every man according
[54:28] to their works
[54:30] and death and hell were cast into the
[54:32] lake of fire
[54:33] this is the second death and whosoever
[54:36] was not
[54:36] found written in the book of life was
[54:39] cast
[54:40] into the lake of fire malachi chapter 3

[55:06] scripture supernaturally and i've read
[55:08] it before and it just really
[55:10] um i don't even know hardly how to
[55:13] explain it
[55:14] but just reading these three verses
[55:16] we're about to read
[55:18] i almost fell in my heart that i could
[55:20] read these three verses
[55:21] i could stand you i could i could i
[55:23] could pray we could dismiss
[55:25] sing a song and we would be thoroughly
[55:28] blessed

[55:32] verses here just
[55:33] meant so much to me and i trust that
[55:35] they mean something to you and we're
[55:36] going to comment a few things on them
[55:38] towards the end
[55:39] let's just read them here malachi
[55:41] chapter 3 start at verse 16.
[55:44] then they that feared the lord
[55:47] spoke often one to another and the lord
[55:51] hearkened and heard it and a book of
[55:54] remembrance was written before him
[55:57] for them that feared the lord and that
[56:00] thought
[56:01] upon his name let's read that verse 16
[56:03] again then they that feared the lord
[56:05] spoke often one to another what were
[56:08] they speaking about their conversation
[56:10] they were speaking about the lord and
[56:12] the lord hearkened
[56:14] means he hasted means he met met the
[56:16] need means he ran to them
[56:18] means they were he was drawn to them and
[56:21] heard it
[56:22] and a book of remembrance was written
[56:25] before him
[56:26] for them that feared the lord and that
[56:29] thought upon his name
[56:30] and they shall be mine saith the lord of
[56:33] hosts
[56:34] in that day when i make up my jewels
[56:38] and i will spare them as a man spareth
[56:40] his own son
[56:42] that serveth him then shall you return
[56:46] and discern between the righteous and
[56:49] the wicked
[56:50] between him that serveth god and him
[56:54] that serveth him not lord jesus

[58:48] minister to you this morning
[58:50] i have a lot as i said upon my heart and
[58:52] i really don't have a real
[58:54] just a clear smooth direction just a lot
[58:57] that i would like to say
[58:58] amen this morning the scripture meant so
[59:00] much to me
[59:02] uh in the age when i begin to
[59:04] contemplate
[59:06] this thought of the age of neurotics
[59:10] i truly believe that we're living as the
[59:13] prophet
[59:14] called this age he said it could well be
[59:17] called
[59:17] the age of neurotics i want to read you
[59:20] and i
[59:21] i apologize this morning it takes a lot
[59:23] of preparation to be able to get the
[59:26] quotes
[59:26] uh to display them the way that we
[59:29] stream to you it's very
[59:31] difficult and i had so many i didn't
[59:33] have time
[59:34] so it is trust you this morning that
[59:36] you'll listen as i read these quotations
[59:38] and not lose your attention
[59:39] amen but listen to them very closely
[59:41] they they meant a great deal to me
[59:44] uh brother barnum says here and i'm just
[59:46] gonna pick up from the middle of this
[59:48] uh this quote here he says well now
[59:52] it is strange but in this age of pliny
[59:54] this is out of the lady you see in
[59:56] church age
[59:57] in this age of plenty uh
[1:00:00] in this age of abundance how can there
[1:00:02] be trials
[1:00:04] well now it is strange he says but in
[1:00:07] this age of plenty and
[1:00:08] opportunity when everyone has so much
[1:00:11] and there is
[1:00:12] so much more to be had what with all the
[1:00:15] inventions to do our work and so many
[1:00:17] things to give us pleasure
[1:00:19] suddenly we find mental illness taking
[1:00:21] such a toll
[1:00:23] as to alarm the nation when every
[1:00:25] everybody ought to be happy
[1:00:28] with really nothing to be unhappy about
[1:00:31] but millions are taking sedatives at
[1:00:33] night
[1:00:34] pet pills in the morning rushing to
[1:00:36] doctors
[1:00:38] entering institutions and trying to
[1:00:40] drown
[1:00:41] out unknown fears by alcohol
[1:00:45] yes this age boasts
[1:00:48] of its tremendous stores of worldly
[1:00:51] goods
[1:00:52] but the people are less happy than ever
[1:00:55] this age boasts of its supernatural
[1:00:58] attainments
[1:00:59] but the people are less sure of
[1:01:02] themselves
[1:01:03] than ever this age boasts of better
[1:01:06] moral values and is
[1:01:08] and it's more corrupt than any age since
[1:01:10] the flood
[1:01:12] it talks about its knowledge and science
[1:01:14] but it is
[1:01:15] fighting a losing battle in all fields
[1:01:19] for the human mind and the soul
[1:01:22] and the spirit cannot comprehend
[1:01:25] or keep abreast with all the changes
[1:01:29] that have come upon the earth in one
[1:01:32] generation
[1:01:33] we have gone all the way from the horse
[1:01:35] and buggy
[1:01:36] to the space age and we're proud and
[1:01:39] boastful about it
[1:01:40] but inside is a dark void
[1:01:44] cavern that is crying out
[1:01:47] in torment and without now here's the
[1:01:51] key to this quote here
[1:01:53] and without a known reason
[1:01:58] there is uh my dad uh said has said my
[1:02:01] whole life he said well the greatest
[1:02:02] fear
[1:02:03] uh is not the fear of whatever's going
[1:02:05] to come upon you or maybe the fear of a
[1:02:07] disease or
[1:02:09] the fear in the world but the greatest
[1:02:10] fear is the fear of the unknown
[1:02:13] when you don't know you you're out of
[1:02:15] answers you don't have an answer to the
[1:02:17] problem
[1:02:18] i believe what you're witnessing today
[1:02:20] in the world is a
[1:02:22] is a paralyzing panic
[1:02:25] uh that's sweeping across the nation i
[1:02:27] posted it to our church whatsapp chat
[1:02:30] and i trust it was a blessing to you uh
[1:02:32] that
[1:02:33] what you're seeing is just a a panic and
[1:02:36] a paralyzing fear
[1:02:38] across all of the world and it's this
[1:02:40] fear
[1:02:41] that they don't know why they've thrown
[1:02:43] all the solutions they've thrown
[1:02:45] political parties they've thrown
[1:02:47] campaigns they've thrown money
[1:02:49] millions of money at it they've flown
[1:02:51] thrown their best drugs
[1:02:53] at the problem that's at the core of
[1:02:55] mankind
[1:02:56] but brother branham says without a
[1:02:59] reason without a known reason
[1:03:01] men's hearts are felling
[1:03:04] for fear the world is so dark
[1:03:08] that this age could well be called the
[1:03:11] age
[1:03:12] of neurotics now you look at that word
[1:03:15] neurotics and it's a
[1:03:16] it's a an actual mental condition
[1:03:19] uh and we were i believe that when
[1:03:21] brother branham was was
[1:03:23] referring to this he was referring to
[1:03:25] something specific he speaks of those
[1:03:28] uh that were uh given to inspiration
[1:03:31] and he says did you know everyone who
[1:03:33] has a gift in their life they tend to be
[1:03:34] a neurotic
[1:03:35] brother adam says that about himself he
[1:03:37] says i've been a neurotic my whole life
[1:03:38] so
[1:03:39] there was something he was interjecting
[1:03:41] here though that was that was different
[1:03:43] uh in in a sense it was different than
[1:03:46] what he's talking about but i believe
[1:03:47] that when you look at
[1:03:49] what the prophet was saying uh he was
[1:03:51] describing this
[1:03:53] insanity this condition of just on edge
[1:03:56] all the time he's he
[1:03:57] preached in the letting off the pressure
[1:03:59] and he says everyone's just in a hurry
[1:04:01] he says just go go and he gives the
[1:04:03] story of uh he's at a hospital
[1:04:05] somewhere and he's trying to go visit a
[1:04:07] a sister in the hospital room and he
[1:04:09] says that i went to the
[1:04:10] you know the information desk and he
[1:04:12] said and the woman there i said well
[1:04:14] ma'am could you help me uh i'm trying to
[1:04:16] find him and she just snapped at him
[1:04:18] real fast and said you know i'm too busy
[1:04:20] why don't you look it up somewhere and
[1:04:21] brother branham said oh my okay and
[1:04:23] he went to the next person he said the
[1:04:25] man there gave him such a look when he
[1:04:27] he was he said oh boy i don't even want
[1:04:28] to speak to him he went to the next
[1:04:30] floor and
[1:04:30] tried to talk to someone and said ma'am
[1:04:32] i've tried 223 and
[1:04:34] she's not in that room and and maybe
[1:04:37] she's in 233 and she said well you go
[1:04:39] try 233
[1:04:40] brother branham startled by and said my
[1:04:42] goodness he said he
[1:04:43] went to the next person he said everyone
[1:04:45] was just in
[1:04:46] such a pressure such a tension
[1:04:50] and this is what he's speaking of when
[1:04:51] he speaks of the age of neurotics
[1:04:54] it's it's a it's a tense uh
[1:04:57] nervousness it's a it's just a stress
[1:04:59] and anxiety that
[1:05:01] blankets the world that we live in and
[1:05:04] and it's
[1:05:04] it's it's very temporarily a
[1:05:08] very temporary peace and men
[1:05:11] and women has tried to drown it out with
[1:05:14] riches and goods and vacations
[1:05:16] and entertainment and we get one
[1:05:19] entertainment only to be flooded my
[1:05:20] brother my sister do you
[1:05:22] well i don't think we realize because it
[1:05:24] happened so
[1:05:25] gradually to us but just in the last as
[1:05:29] brother adam begins to say we went from
[1:05:31] the horse and buggy age into the
[1:05:32] astronaut age and
[1:05:34] and he says and all we boast about it so
[1:05:36] much we've just progressed so much and
[1:05:38] yet we're more miserable than we've ever
[1:05:40] been yet we're more unhappy than we've
[1:05:42] ever been
[1:05:43] and let me just say let me just update
[1:05:45] it here today
[1:05:46] we have more uh entertainment at our
[1:05:49] fingertips
[1:05:50] than we've ever had before we have more
[1:05:52] things
[1:05:53] to drown out the noise of the world we
[1:05:56] have more things to drown out the
[1:05:57] pressure
[1:05:58] to check out of the pressure and stress
[1:06:00] of life
[1:06:02] there everything's at our fingertips
[1:06:03] nowadays it's entertainment has just
[1:06:06] blanketed and i'm speaking not just to
[1:06:08] the world
[1:06:09] uh you're saying amen i'm sure to the
[1:06:10] word this morning but believers aren't
[1:06:12] exempt from that
[1:06:14] we have to guard brother branham gave us
[1:06:16] a warning he said i want to give you a
[1:06:17] warning you've got to guard against soft
[1:06:20] living in this age
[1:06:21] he said it's the spirit of this age it
[1:06:23] gets you soft to get you off guard
[1:06:25] it gets you not ready and and you you
[1:06:28] you're
[1:06:28] in danger of being like those described
[1:06:31] in the book of luke
[1:06:32] where the master returns and his servant
[1:06:36] and he finds a servant
[1:06:37] sleeping and and i believe that we're
[1:06:39] just so
[1:06:40] inundated constantly inundated with
[1:06:43] entertainment on our phone entertainment
[1:06:46] on our computer
[1:06:47] entertainment on our laptop
[1:06:48] entertainment in the world is just
[1:06:50] constant
[1:06:51] constant constant feeding and consuming
[1:06:54] we live in the age of consumption
[1:06:56] where even all of our devices are
[1:06:59] tailored and
[1:06:59] engineered specific not for production
[1:07:02] but they're engineered for consumption
[1:07:06] and they're engineered to consume and
[1:07:08] everything is about
[1:07:09] everything i can consume my brother my
[1:07:11] sister as brother branham said
[1:07:13] everything the devil does is just a
[1:07:15] perversion of what god's doing
[1:07:17] and let me tell you god has an age this
[1:07:19] is the age of consumption
[1:07:21] and you should be consuming as the bible
[1:07:23] says john
[1:07:24] eat the book and and and prophesy
[1:07:28] you must prophesy again but before you
[1:07:30] prophesy
[1:07:31] you've got to consume it we should be
[1:07:33] living in the age of consumption but we
[1:07:35] should be consuming
[1:07:36] the word of god a daily appetite i say
[1:07:40] lord help me
[1:07:41] help me change my appetite from this
[1:07:43] worlds of vain riches and entertainment
[1:07:46] and let my
[1:07:47] appetite be changed to the word of god
[1:07:49] where i consume it daily
[1:07:52] daily in my life it's the age of brother
[1:07:56] adam says it can well be called the age
[1:07:58] of
[1:07:58] neurotics it boasts but it can't back it
[1:08:02] up
[1:08:03] it cries peace and there is no peace
[1:08:06] it cries that it has a great amplitude
[1:08:08] of all things but
[1:08:10] it keeps burning with desire
[1:08:13] like an unsatisfied fire
[1:08:18] the bible says there is no peace for the
[1:08:21] wicked
[1:08:22] saith my god there's no peace to the
[1:08:24] wicked they search for it they long for
[1:08:26] it and it could be described as the age
[1:08:29] of neurotics uh uh
[1:08:33] as the bible says it say or brother
[1:08:35] branham says he says i prophesy
[1:08:38] in the name of the lord that this world
[1:08:40] will go
[1:08:41] completely insane
[1:08:45] think about that just fear for a moment
[1:08:47] the world will go
[1:08:49] completely insane
[1:08:52] my brother my sister you may not realize
[1:08:54] it but every day when you send your
[1:08:56] children to school every day you
[1:08:58] get in your car brother and you go to
[1:08:59] work every day sister you go about your
[1:09:01] life's business
[1:09:03] you are living amongst diseased
[1:09:06] people neurotic is a disease you're
[1:09:09] living amongst diseased people
[1:09:11] diseased minds diseased spirits
[1:09:14] and you say how have they how is the
[1:09:17] world became this way
[1:09:18] because it rejected the only thing that
[1:09:21] can give them peace
[1:09:22] it's rejected the only thing that could
[1:09:24] they could give them
[1:09:25] uh uh tranquility and and love and
[1:09:28] harmony
[1:09:29] it's rejected the word of god so god has
[1:09:32] given it chaos and
[1:09:35] and stress and anxiety they have
[1:09:37] rejected the word of god
[1:09:41] it's an age to where the world is
[1:09:42] completely groping as we said
[1:09:44] in darkness i believe here more
[1:09:48] than ever before that there's a
[1:09:51] especially with the latest pandemic and
[1:09:53] i want you just to stay with me very
[1:09:54] closely here this morning
[1:09:56] because i'm going to cover a lot and
[1:09:58] some of what i'm going to do is
[1:10:00] more maybe on the grounds of teaching
[1:10:02] and i believe
[1:10:03] brother adam said teach and establishes
[1:10:04] the church and so we want to bring
[1:10:06] something here this morning and just
[1:10:09] maybe bring some balance to some things
[1:10:12] i believe that the age of of neurotics
[1:10:15] that we're
[1:10:16] living in it could be no better defined
[1:10:19] than the day and age 2020 in july of
[1:10:23] 2020
[1:10:25] uh we are maturing more and more
[1:10:27] maturing
[1:10:28] the world is more maturing to fit
[1:10:30] perfectly this description
[1:10:32] of this prophecy that the world would go
[1:10:34] completely
[1:10:35] out of their minds they would go
[1:10:37] completely insane
[1:10:39] and you're witnessing it today friend i
[1:10:41] want you to wake up pinch yourself this
[1:10:43] morning
[1:10:44] it is not an accident what's happening
[1:10:46] right now in the world it is not just
[1:10:49] it is not just random it's this entire
[1:10:52] pandemic that's hitting the world it's
[1:10:54] it's not just oh it just happened oh
[1:10:56] it's just an accident and we'll get over
[1:10:58] it my brother my sister it's not an
[1:10:59] accident
[1:11:01] the bible says the times and the seasons
[1:11:03] are in the hand of god and i believe
[1:11:04] it's the season of the rapture
[1:11:06] i believe what we're witnessing today
[1:11:09] there's no way
[1:11:10] there's no way anybody could deny what
[1:11:12] you're witnessing today
[1:11:14] is apocalyptic events transpiring things
[1:11:17] that were written about in the book of
[1:11:18] revelation
[1:11:19] maybe maybe just a preview of what's
[1:11:22] coming
[1:11:24] but what we find in this age of
[1:11:26] neurotics
[1:11:28] is a world that has gone completely
[1:11:32] insane
[1:11:34] it's an age and atmosphere that is
[1:11:37] inundated with goods wealth
[1:11:40] entertainment and and and and
[1:11:44] everything that you could think that
[1:11:45] would satisfy a person yet we find that
[1:11:47] they're not satisfied
[1:11:49] yet we find that they we and my brother
[1:11:51] my sister you're living in this age this
[1:11:54] is where you're at this is what you
[1:11:56] breathe in
[1:11:57] every single day when you go out to your
[1:11:58] job or to your work or wherever you go
[1:12:01] this is what you're breathing in every
[1:12:02] single day that is why
[1:12:04] my brother my sister it is so important
[1:12:07] that you stay
[1:12:08] in the word of god that you make that
[1:12:10] the centerpiece of your life
[1:12:12] oh as we we displayed the quote for you
[1:12:14] uh through the chat
[1:12:16] let the word of the hour be your
[1:12:18] stabilization
[1:12:20] although the fear great fear waves are
[1:12:23] a fear for waves are all around us
[1:12:25] brother adam says let the word
[1:12:27] stay in the word don't move from it let
[1:12:29] it be your stabilizer in this hour
[1:12:33] let me just say this to you today my
[1:12:35] brother my sister
[1:12:37] this is this world is groping in
[1:12:38] darkness it's it's falling apart
[1:12:41] and let me just say this there is no
[1:12:43] church affiliation
[1:12:45] that will save you from it there is no
[1:12:47] church organization no government
[1:12:50] system or structure that no prophesying
[1:12:53] is going to save you from the
[1:12:54] coming impending judgment that's coming
[1:12:57] not not even preaching the gospel will
[1:12:59] save you
[1:13:00] not even casting out demons will do it
[1:13:02] or working wonders but it's going to
[1:13:04] come down to
[1:13:05] individual character whether your deeds
[1:13:10] which means your way of living is
[1:13:12] righteous
[1:13:13] or wicked as we read in malachi chapter
[1:13:16] 3 and verse 18 then you shall return and
[1:13:19] discern
[1:13:20] between the righteous and the wicked
[1:13:22] between him that serveth god
[1:13:24] and him that serveth him not
[1:13:31] we see an age that's completely a world
[1:13:34] that's fallen apart
[1:13:36] there's even a i believe a survival
[1:13:38] panic
[1:13:39] that is gripping the entire world church
[1:13:42] world included
[1:13:44] we see these things unfolded in our
[1:13:46] world
[1:13:48] and if we're not careful we become
[1:13:50] gripped
[1:13:51] by this survival mode
[1:13:54] you know the survivalist mentality
[1:13:58] and you know it becomes this
[1:14:01] this thing of well you know what's we we
[1:14:04] got to we got to be wise we got to have
[1:14:05] wisdom we got to
[1:14:07] you know we we better stock up we better
[1:14:09] store it better buy silver because look
[1:14:10] what's happening with all the
[1:14:12] with all the cash or with all the cr you
[1:14:14] know now that they'll they don't there's
[1:14:15] such a cash a coin shortage that
[1:14:17] you got to use debit card and credit
[1:14:19] card and what is it for the man what's
[1:14:20] going to happen should we buy silver
[1:14:22] should we buy gold should we
[1:14:24] all live in tents should we go out in
[1:14:25] the you know in the wilderness somewhere
[1:14:27] and build a bomb shelter and live in
[1:14:29] bomb shelter and start should we start
[1:14:30] stocking up on canned goods
[1:14:34] and you know there's this survival panic
[1:14:36] that goes across
[1:14:37] the world let me say this tragically too
[1:14:40] many believers are living in the
[1:14:42] survival panic grip as if
[1:14:45] everything was out of control my brother
[1:14:47] my sister there's one thing you
[1:14:49] you must remember god has everything in
[1:14:51] control
[1:14:52] it's very simple oh amen brother matt it
[1:14:55] becomes a cliche
[1:14:56] just think just just just dwell on that
[1:14:57] for a minute god
[1:14:59] has everything in
[1:15:02] control he's not let control go
[1:15:05] the creator has everything in
[1:15:09] control should we get ready and stash
[1:15:12] away ammunition should we buy up guns
[1:15:14] and stash away gold or diamonds and get
[1:15:17] ready for this great
[1:15:19] terrifying depression even as some have
[1:15:22] suggested to me
[1:15:23] uh here recently i had a brother sincere
[1:15:26] brother i'm sure
[1:15:28] but but brother branham said you can be
[1:15:30] sincere and sincerely wrong
[1:15:32] and uh this brother was making
[1:15:35] he was he was starting to believe that
[1:15:37] this coveted you know 19 and all this
[1:15:39] other stuff happening was
[1:15:41] at the beginning of the tribulation
[1:15:43] period and and brother branham predicted
[1:15:45] this that the
[1:15:46] the the the the message congregations
[1:15:49] would see the tribulation and
[1:15:50] realize we missed the rapture let me
[1:15:53] just say this let me just correct this
[1:15:54] here just for a moment in your minds
[1:15:56] because it's important
[1:15:57] what your anticipation and your
[1:15:59] expectation is it will determine
[1:16:02] how you live uh let me just say this
[1:16:05] today and brothers
[1:16:06] if you want to display some of those
[1:16:07] quotes i'm going to read them for those
[1:16:09] in the live stream you'll just have to
[1:16:10] listen those at churchill
[1:16:11] see this i didn't have time to put them
[1:16:13] up but the
[1:16:15] the bride i read this here in titus
[1:16:18] chapter two it's very very lord has put
[1:16:21] this upon my heart
[1:16:23] and and i want to read it to you just
[1:16:25] here for a moment
[1:16:26] uh in titus chapter 2 verse 11
[1:16:29] through 13. now now this brother was
[1:16:31] suggesting that we are
[1:16:33] he went further and suggested that this
[1:16:35] is the tribulation right now
[1:16:36] that what you're seeing right now is the
[1:16:39] tribulation period it's just the
[1:16:40] beginning
[1:16:41] and uh and and and we missed the rapture
[1:16:44] uh the brother even went on to say the
[1:16:46] rapture was spiritual the resurrection
[1:16:48] was all spiritual
[1:16:50] it had no physical uh fulfillment which
[1:16:53] is
[1:16:53] obviously in direct uh contrary to even
[1:16:57] what
[1:16:57] not only what the message says what the
[1:16:59] bible says paul dealt with filthus and
[1:17:01] hymenius
[1:17:03] and and you go read about it where he
[1:17:04] says that concerning filthus and
[1:17:06] hymenias who say that the resurrection
[1:17:08] has already passed
[1:17:10] and paul says and he's overthrown
[1:17:12] they've overthrown the faith of many
[1:17:13] believing this
[1:17:15] this this this um false doctrine didn't
[1:17:17] start in our age it's been all the way
[1:17:19] from the age of paul
[1:17:20] that that his brother went on to say
[1:17:22] that they right that they
[1:17:24] you know that this is the tribulation
[1:17:26] and we've all missed the rapture and
[1:17:28] we've got to start preparing for the
[1:17:30] tribulation we got to start preparing
[1:17:32] how to
[1:17:32] you know how to prepare ourselves and
[1:17:34] you even you know you had this um
[1:17:37] you had this dream that we showed you
[1:17:39] and let me just
[1:17:40] i may seem scattered but let me just let
[1:17:42] me just uh express my heart here today
[1:17:45] you have this dream here that we just
[1:17:48] played to you from
[1:17:49] this dana um cover stone i think his
[1:17:51] name was
[1:17:52] wonderful wonderful video i don't regret
[1:17:55] it all playing it
[1:17:56] i think it had a uh it served its
[1:17:58] intended purpose and i trusted it
[1:18:00] that it was a blessing to you but let me
[1:18:03] just
[1:18:04] be clear uh on this man
[1:18:07] and his and his dream because i even had
[1:18:10] a very disappointing thing it's amazing
[1:18:12] sometimes how well you clarify something
[1:18:15] and and i've realized and learned uh
[1:18:17] through ministry that no matter
[1:18:19] how long you spend clarifying something
[1:18:21] or how much time you put into something
[1:18:24] somebody's gonna misunderstand it no
[1:18:25] matter how good of a job you do
[1:18:27] a plus plus plus plus plus job uh
[1:18:31] qualifying and explaining and and and
[1:18:34] and and and just qualifying everything
[1:18:36] in someone's mind
[1:18:37] someone's gonna misunderstand i had a
[1:18:39] dear sister godly sister
[1:18:40] who uh was about to take a job and uh
[1:18:43] and i played that video
[1:18:45] and she she now has not wanted to take
[1:18:47] the job said oh after that video i just
[1:18:48] need to get ready for the rapture and
[1:18:50] i thought my goodness you've missed the
[1:18:52] whole you missed the whole point
[1:18:54] you missed everything you know i believe
[1:18:57] that this
[1:18:57] video was significant i believe it has
[1:19:00] significance you know i think i
[1:19:02] shared that uh with you the sunday that
[1:19:05] we played it
[1:19:06] and and it's amazing because this this
[1:19:09] man is from kentucky he's from the same
[1:19:11] town
[1:19:11] that was brother branham's homeland his
[1:19:14] his town
[1:19:15] and uh and you know he's he's saying in
[1:19:17] this dream that he dreamed about
[1:19:19] covet and all of the masks and the riots
[1:19:22] and the protests and
[1:19:23] i believe that he did i believe very
[1:19:25] very much accurately my personal belief
[1:19:28] is that
[1:19:28] that this man no doubt had a dream that
[1:19:31] came from the lord
[1:19:32] and and he was suggesting that his
[1:19:35] future dream
[1:19:36] his other dreams he had was that coming
[1:19:38] up in november election will trigger or
[1:19:40] trigger a civil war and there will be
[1:19:43] chaos and
[1:19:44] u.n is going to have to intervene and
[1:19:46] and and you know all of these things now
[1:19:48] i appreciated everything that the man
[1:19:50] said pastor and uh you know i liked his
[1:19:53] humility he wasn't trying to make
[1:19:54] himself somebody
[1:19:56] and not trying to make himself a prophet
[1:19:58] not trying to make his dream
[1:20:00] even a prophecy or thus saith the lord
[1:20:02] said he might be wrong and
[1:20:04] and his first stream was right and i'll
[1:20:06] apologize in december if i was wrong and
[1:20:09] and all of these things were encouraging
[1:20:11] that's what made me comfortable with
[1:20:12] playing it
[1:20:13] but i realized that sometimes you put
[1:20:15] something before people
[1:20:17] and you've got to be really careful uh
[1:20:20] uh as i as i presented that to you i
[1:20:22] want to make sure it's put in your minds
[1:20:24] correctly
[1:20:25] and and i believe that you know as i
[1:20:28] said
[1:20:28] um you know that i i believe that that
[1:20:31] that
[1:20:32] that dreams are prophetic in the bible
[1:20:34] and and and the the person who the dream
[1:20:36] comes to is
[1:20:37] there's no discrimination with god who
[1:20:39] it comes to that a dream came to a false
[1:20:41] prophet
[1:20:42] balak and he prophesied a dream come to
[1:20:44] abimelech uh who who was an unrighteous
[1:20:47] man who
[1:20:48] was about to take abraham abraham's wife
[1:20:51] sarah
[1:20:52] and abraham lied and told him it was his
[1:20:54] sister and god comes to him in a dream
[1:20:56] and says you'd sleep with her
[1:20:57] you're as good as a dead man uh you have
[1:21:00] another example of pilate's wife
[1:21:02] and she says this man's come to me and
[1:21:04] and my dreams are tormenting me about
[1:21:06] this man and don't have anything to do
[1:21:08] with him just let him
[1:21:09] you know let him be and so um
[1:21:12] so i but you say brother matt who is
[1:21:14] this dream for here's
[1:21:15] here's what i know that the context of
[1:21:18] the dream the entire
[1:21:20] basis or the core theme was
[1:21:23] this message that he kept hearing brace
[1:21:26] yourself brace yourself he said i heard
[1:21:29] it again
[1:21:30] brace yourself and he said he had the
[1:21:32] dream about the calendar and and seen it
[1:21:34] in november and he said he heard the
[1:21:35] message again
[1:21:36] brace yourself here's what i know my
[1:21:39] brother my sister
[1:21:40] there is a people who should be bracing
[1:21:43] themself
[1:21:45] but there's also a people who should be
[1:21:47] preparing themselves
[1:21:49] and it's a very different message
[1:21:53] let me just say here with and i'd to
[1:21:55] slow down so that i don't just blaze
[1:21:57] right over this
[1:21:57] i want to make sure it's real clear in
[1:21:59] your minds
[1:22:01] we have received the vindicated
[1:22:04] message of god and everything god
[1:22:07] wanted us to receive to prepare us for a
[1:22:10] rapture we
[1:22:11] already have received we don't need a
[1:22:14] message from a man from kentucky
[1:22:16] we don't need a message from a man from
[1:22:18] trinidad we don't need a message from a
[1:22:20] man from australia from tucson a prophet
[1:22:23] uh it doesn't matter jesus prophet told
[1:22:26] us about this that if he's in the
[1:22:27] you know behold he goeth he's in the
[1:22:29] west and behold he's here
[1:22:30] and and you know he's in the cave and he
[1:22:32] says but but here here's the message
[1:22:34] we've received
[1:22:35] we've already received the shout and the
[1:22:38] shout was what
[1:22:40] brother brandon made it clear he said it
[1:22:41] was the message get ready

[1:22:45] message of the hour

[1:22:57] people and be not partakers with her
[1:23:01] so that you receive not her plagues
[1:23:04] there is a group of people there's
[1:23:06] multiple groups of people that god
[1:23:08] speaks to
[1:23:09] in the word brother brandon picks this
[1:23:12] up in the with when he's dealing with
[1:23:13] the book of revelations and he says you
[1:23:15] have to be careful
[1:23:16] because the spirit speaks to the true
[1:23:19] vine and the false spine
[1:23:21] and you've got to know whose message is
[1:23:22] what because there's a message for every
[1:23:24] group

[1:23:27] there's a message for the for the wise
[1:23:29] virgin the elected seed of god

[1:24:12] he says quiet down
[1:24:14] what's the matter with the christian the
[1:24:17] spirit of the world today is neurotic

[1:26:06] who do you believe that dream was for i
[1:26:08] believe it had a purpose an intended
[1:26:09] effect for the foolish virgin
[1:26:11] i believe for for the for the false
[1:26:13] remnant though those those who are
[1:26:15] uh uh those who aren't under the sound
[1:26:18] or the calling of the elected seed of
[1:26:20] god the bride of jesus christ
[1:26:22] i believe there's a message going forth
[1:26:24] a preparation
[1:26:25] preparing them for a tribulation and
[1:26:28] and and and even even that dream as i
[1:26:31] said
[1:26:32] you know one the sister took it that way
[1:26:34] i thought my you've completely missed
[1:26:36] the point
[1:26:37] this isn't the message for the bride now
[1:26:39] now
[1:26:41] i tell you what abimelech's dream
[1:26:43] stirred abraham who was the seed of god
[1:26:46] stirred his heart so that dream was for
[1:26:48] abimelech but it also was for abraham
[1:26:51] so so that dream was the message brace
[1:26:54] yourself was for the world
[1:26:55] man goes on to say should we buy up
[1:26:56] goods we need to buy up ammunition we
[1:26:58] need to buy
[1:26:59] buy into silver you know they have all
[1:27:01] and maybe that's right for them that's
[1:27:03] right for those
[1:27:04] uh who that message is for but my
[1:27:06] brother my sister we've received another
[1:27:08] message

[1:27:30] heart pre-planned for god
[1:27:32] prepared let me let me give you what i
[1:27:35] thought brother aaron pre-programmed
[1:27:37] everything is pre-programmed god's not
[1:27:40] programming the stage or the show as it
[1:27:43] goes
[1:27:44] it's already been pre-programmed your
[1:27:46] life has been pre-programmed
[1:27:48] your election is secure and it's and
[1:27:51] it's before the foundation of the world
[1:27:53] glory we could preach a whole message on
[1:27:55] that
[1:27:56] but brother aaron was saying there's a
[1:27:57] constant revolving news cycle uh
[1:28:00] and and he was i think brother arne was
[1:28:02] telling him that you know he said back
[1:28:03] in his days said it wasn't like this you
[1:28:05] heard the news maybe from a newspaper
[1:28:07] maybe
[1:28:07] at the barbershop you'd hear maybe from
[1:28:10] your family member you'd hear
[1:28:11] now it's just constant push notification
[1:28:14] and you get the latest fox you get the
[1:28:15] latest
[1:28:16] whatever your news outlet is you get
[1:28:18] this latest uh little notification
[1:28:20] ding ding ding and it's constant now my
[1:28:23] brother my sister
[1:28:24] the news cycle has always been at the
[1:28:26] same speed it is today
[1:28:28] but the difference is is that we're
[1:28:30] notified and people are on edge
[1:28:32] all the time this is what breeds the age
[1:28:35] of insanity
[1:28:36] even this brother this pastor said that
[1:28:39] every day i think he said i read 40 to
[1:28:41] 50
[1:28:42] whatever it was newspapers every single
[1:28:45] day
[1:28:46] uh that he that he reads 40 to 50 let me
[1:28:49] just find that
[1:28:50] uh in my note here that i had uh yeah he
[1:28:53] said he had read 40 to 50 newspaper
[1:28:56] uh every single day and i and i begin to
[1:29:00] think about this
[1:29:01] you know this is a message i believe
[1:29:04] it's a dream from god
[1:29:06] but it's for those who miss the rapture
[1:29:08] for those who aren't called or elected
[1:29:10] or ordained to see the message
[1:29:12] and and uh you know i i thought about
[1:29:15] that here just for a moment
[1:29:18] and let me just find my notes here i
[1:29:19] wrote down on it
[1:29:21] um and it it
[1:29:25] to me in the context of the message the
[1:29:28] difference is is that
[1:29:30] it lacks revelation this man doesn't
[1:29:32] have the revelation of the
[1:29:34] of of the end time message so what does
[1:29:36] he have for him god gives him a dream
[1:29:39] brace yourself prepare yourself
[1:29:41] there's a foolish virgin who are who are
[1:29:44] going to go through the tribulation to
[1:29:46] be purged for their sin of unbelief
[1:29:48] and god hasn't forgotten about them now
[1:29:50] let me get back to my scripture
[1:29:52] thank you lord for reminding me and
[1:29:54] titus
[1:29:55] uh chapter two now now you say brother
[1:29:57] matt what does that mean
[1:29:58] it means the message wasn't a negative
[1:30:01] message
[1:30:02] the message of the hour is not a message
[1:30:04] of get guns get ammunition
[1:30:06] uh prepare stocked goods canned goods
[1:30:09] get ready for it
[1:30:10] because it's coming no that the message
[1:30:13] of the hour is this
[1:30:14] fear not little bride we are to live and
[1:30:17] go forward in
[1:30:18] faith and not in fear of the ongoings of
[1:30:21] the world
[1:30:23] ah the the the god hasn't caught his
[1:30:25] bride to dig in and fortify herself
[1:30:28] but rather look up for your redemption
[1:30:32] draweth nigh the man makes a comedy he's
[1:30:35] reads 40 to newspapers a day
[1:30:37] perhaps maybe just the headlines i have
[1:30:39] to begin to think about this my brother
[1:30:40] my sister
[1:30:41] if you were to do this if you're
[1:30:43] constantly if you're to constantly
[1:30:44] consume this
[1:30:46] headlines all day a new cycle all day
[1:30:48] and you ingest that as brother aaron
[1:30:50] preach wednesday night
[1:30:51] and you constantly are ruled by that and
[1:30:54] you're constantly consuming that
[1:30:56] then it's going to produce an atmosphere
[1:30:58] that you live in and the atmosphere is
[1:30:59] going to be the same atmosphere of the
[1:31:00] world insanity
[1:31:02] an age of neurotics uh and i believe
[1:31:05] even we
[1:31:06] ourselves if that's what we're feeding
[1:31:08] on my brother my sister
[1:31:10] i believe we're gonna have trouble
[1:31:12] getting into the channel
[1:31:13] that the lord wants us to be in uh this
[1:31:16] overwhelming influence of the newspapers
[1:31:19] and the world
[1:31:20] would would it's going to do damage to
[1:31:22] our spirits and our mind
[1:31:24] causing us to be alarmed by some of
[1:31:26] these things we hear about when the
[1:31:27] message that we have is not a message of
[1:31:29] alarm
[1:31:30] it's a message of peace it's a message
[1:31:32] of shalom
[1:31:34] it's a message of it is well with my
[1:31:38] soul
[1:31:39] amen amen the the lord gave us a message
[1:31:43] through the
[1:31:44] eyes of a prophet and our future
[1:31:47] was revealed in that message and our
[1:31:49] future was not one of condemnation and
[1:31:51] plagues
[1:31:52] our future was a future of peace and
[1:31:55] love
[1:31:56] and faith shalom
[1:32:00] titus chapter two
[1:32:04] you don't have to turn there just listen
[1:32:06] and let me read it to you
[1:32:08] if i could just here for a moment but
[1:32:12] titus let me let me just find it here i
[1:32:14] have it written down in these notes here
[1:32:16] on my phone
[1:32:17] titus verse chapter 2 verse 11 teaching
[1:32:20] us notice what he says here
[1:32:22] teaching us this is what the word

[1:32:26] teaching us that denying ungodliness
[1:32:29] and worldly lust we should live soberly
[1:32:34] righteously and godly
[1:32:37] now notice this last part in this
[1:32:41] present world in
[1:32:44] this cosmos in this
[1:32:48] there's a present world and there's a
[1:32:50] world coming and the bible gives us

[1:32:54] titus as just one of many the word gives
[1:32:56] us instructions do you realize that

[1:33:38] world sees when you look at a bible
[1:33:39] friends when you hold the message of the
[1:33:41] hour up what are you looking through

[1:33:50] up a leather-bound bible
[1:33:52] and said this is the only absolute god
[1:33:53] ever gave
[1:33:55] and so you say what is your absolute
[1:33:57] your opinion of that bible no
[1:33:58] that's not my absolute my absolute was
[1:34:00] the absolute interpretation of the
[1:34:03] divinely
[1:34:04] of the written word by the spoken word
[1:34:07] and
[1:34:07] who who who spoke at a kentucky
[1:34:09] hillbilly with seventh grade education
[1:34:10] no
[1:34:11] no no no that was just the vessel god
[1:34:14] used he was just the mailman
[1:34:16] the message came from the king

[1:34:36] everything you need to live there's
[1:34:39] instructions
[1:34:40] for how to live pre-rapture notice my
[1:34:44] my my words i'm using here everything
[1:34:47] you need to know and how to live before
[1:34:49] the coming of the lord
[1:34:51] is written right in the bible we just
[1:34:53] read it in titus chapter 2 just one
[1:34:55] verse
[1:34:56] everything you need all the instructions
[1:34:59] for how to conduct ourself and how to
[1:35:02] live our lives before the lord
[1:35:03] in this present world are right in the
[1:35:05] bible but i tell you what is not
[1:35:08] what you will not find instructions for
[1:35:11] what is missing and what
[1:35:15] paul doesn't instruct us in peter
[1:35:17] doesn't instruct a sin
[1:35:19] jesus never mentions it none of john
[1:35:21] never
[1:35:22] mentions it what you will not find
[1:35:25] is that there is nothing said or
[1:35:28] taught or instructions on how to conduct
[1:35:31] yourself
[1:35:32] or how to live in the tribulation
[1:35:36] you won't find that you won't find
[1:35:38] nothing written
[1:35:39] about when the plagues begin to fall
[1:35:41] believers this is how you're to live
[1:35:43] this is where you're to go this is what
[1:35:44] you're to do
[1:35:45] now christians you use those of you who
[1:35:48] who when the tribulation starts to fall
[1:35:50] and and judgment begins to strike you're
[1:35:52] to do this you're to go here you're to
[1:35:54] watch for this you're to buy silver you
[1:35:56] buy gold you buy stocks better buy
[1:35:57] canned goods better buy
[1:35:58] ammunition living out in the desert live
[1:36:00] 40 miles away east of any town no you
[1:36:02] don't find any of that
[1:36:04] there's nothing said or taught about how
[1:36:06] to live and conduct yourself
[1:36:08] for god's family there's nothing said
[1:36:10] about god's family
[1:36:12] because why by the map because god's
[1:36:14] people doesn't go
[1:36:15] through or to the tribulation we go
[1:36:18] through a rapture that's why there's
[1:36:20] nothing written about it
[1:36:22] do you realize my brother my sister if
[1:36:24] we are meant to go through
[1:36:26] pre-tribulational judgment then there
[1:36:28] will be something written about it but
[1:36:29] there's nothing written nor
[1:36:30] said about it brother branham says
[1:36:34] there's no place where the church ever
[1:36:37] goes through the tribulation period
[1:36:39] christ's blood and the fullness of the
[1:36:43] application of the blood of jesus christ
[1:36:45] cleanses all sin
[1:36:46] and why do we have to be purged why do
[1:36:48] we have to be purged
[1:36:50] what is the tribulation for it's for a
[1:36:52] purging
[1:36:53] and and that it's a cleansing a holy
[1:36:55] fire it purges it cleanses brother madam
[1:36:57] says why do we have to be purged
[1:36:59] we are purged daily
[1:37:02] and then he stops he says no tribulation
[1:37:05] listen listen what jesus said in saint
[1:37:07] john 5 24 he that heareth my words
[1:37:09] believeth on him that sent me
[1:37:10] hath everlasting life and shall not come
[1:37:12] to the judgment but is passed from death
[1:37:14] unto life amen uh brother branham says
[1:37:17] in another place
[1:37:18] you say the church has to go through the
[1:37:20] persecution
[1:37:21] for the perfection of it then he says
[1:37:24] the blood of jesus christ
[1:37:26] listen to what he says here let me read
[1:37:28] it again you say the church has to go
[1:37:29] through the persecution
[1:37:31] but the man i know we're waiting on all
[1:37:33] this covet and everything is just
[1:37:34] setting up to close the church doors
[1:37:36] it's that squeeze brother brandon
[1:37:38] referred to
[1:37:39] you know and and it's going to be
[1:37:40] persecution it's going to get hard we
[1:37:41] see nothing yet
[1:37:42] people are believers are complaining
[1:37:44] about coping we ain't seen nothing yet
[1:37:45] my brother my sister i just
[1:37:47] i i i don't i don't i don't see that in
[1:37:50] the word
[1:37:51] i don't see that in my future uh i see
[1:37:54] an age of neurotics
[1:37:56] but at the same time i see an age of not
[1:37:57] survivors with a survivor
[1:37:59] mentality the word doesn't speak about
[1:38:01] survivors doesn't speak about those
[1:38:03] survivalists living in the woods
[1:38:05] it says to him that overcometh will i
[1:38:08] grant to sit with me on my throne there
[1:38:09] are no survivors of lady asea
[1:38:11] you won't survive you'll miss the
[1:38:14] rapture and you give your life
[1:38:17] for the witness for the testimony of
[1:38:19] jesus christ but for the believer
[1:38:20] there's a no there's an overcoming not a
[1:38:22] survivalist
[1:38:24] brother madam says he says you say the
[1:38:27] church has to be persecuted for the
[1:38:29] perfection of it the blood of jesus
[1:38:30] christ perfects the bride
[1:38:33] a man who chooses a wife don't put her
[1:38:36] through a lot of punishment
[1:38:37] he's already found grace with her she's
[1:38:40] found grace with him
[1:38:42] he engages to her and if there is
[1:38:44] anything
[1:38:45] i love that if there is anything
[1:38:49] he'll keep her from every place
[1:38:53] to turn her hand his grace is so
[1:38:57] great upon them
[1:39:00] a group specific and so it will be upon
[1:39:04] the bride
[1:39:06] and so it is on the bride we unworthy
[1:39:10] creatures
[1:39:10] deserving of hell but his grace
[1:39:14] holds us through it glory
[1:39:17] you say brother matt what is in the
[1:39:19] future is it is it more
[1:39:21] uh is it more is is persecution you know
[1:39:24] as we said
[1:39:26] this brother you know made the made the
[1:39:28] comment
[1:39:30] sincere loving brother not not speaking
[1:39:32] ill about him at all
[1:39:34] brother adam says the first thing now
[1:39:36] this is on the pdf brother uh jordan if
[1:39:38] you want to display that you can
[1:39:40] the first thing was the sleeping virgin
[1:39:43] had to go through the tribulation say
[1:39:44] brother matt who goes through the
[1:39:45] tribulation who goes through rapture
[1:39:47] let's just teach on it here for a moment
[1:39:49] the first thing was the sleeping virgin
[1:39:51] had to go through the tribulation for
[1:39:53] the purification
[1:39:54] she had to be purged of her sins
[1:39:57] of unbelief and rejecting the message
[1:40:01] this she was done in the tribulation
[1:40:04] period that's what happens to the
[1:40:06] foolish virgin
[1:40:07] those without oil brother branham says
[1:40:10] that he says that they are
[1:40:11] they are not saved as you are saved now
[1:40:14] you have eternal life now
[1:40:16] the nominal believer doesn't even have
[1:40:18] eternal life now they're believing
[1:40:20] unto and they'll be granted at the white
[1:40:22] throne judgment they'll be granted
[1:40:24] eternal life you are a believer
[1:40:26] those who are born again with the
[1:40:27] baptisms the holy ghost having an
[1:40:28] inheritance a portion are the only ones
[1:40:30] with eternal life right now
[1:40:32] everybody else is believing unto you
[1:40:34] saber the mat well thank god i'm in a
[1:40:36] message church i'm exempt
[1:40:37] wrong thank god my parents were born i
[1:40:40] was born and raised in the message i'm
[1:40:41] exempt
[1:40:42] wrong my brother my sister god doesn't
[1:40:45] discriminate as we said
[1:40:47] no organization is going to save you no
[1:40:49] no newsletter you get every month is
[1:40:51] gonna save you
[1:40:52] no tithing you pay is gonna save you
[1:40:54] give all your money
[1:40:55] but lose your soul no no affiliation not
[1:40:59] even preaching will save you
[1:41:01] not even prophesying as the bible says
[1:41:03] will save you not even healing the sick
[1:41:05] or raising the dead will save you
[1:41:06] so brother matt what's going to get me
[1:41:07] in a rapture it won't be affiliation
[1:41:10] with any church or movement or message
[1:41:12] or title or family remember
[1:41:15] it'll be one affiliation and that's
[1:41:17] jesus christ
[1:41:18] that you have been purchased bought
[1:41:20] regenerated through eternal life by the
[1:41:22] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:41:25] that's the only thing that will save you
[1:41:27] because that's what
[1:41:28] purges you brother adam says
[1:41:32] we're at the end we see we're at the end
[1:41:34] there's
[1:41:35] not no way to build upon the corruption
[1:41:38] how can we build upon a city
[1:41:39] how can we build a city upon the charter
[1:41:41] ruins of a sodom and gomorrah
[1:41:43] how can we do it there's only one
[1:41:45] phoenix left and that's
[1:41:47] the coming of the lord jesus oh my
[1:41:51] a purification through the tribulation
[1:41:54] period
[1:41:55] to bring back a restoring of a world the
[1:41:58] earth for a people
[1:42:01] who are just in the sight of god and
[1:42:03] live by his word
[1:42:05] he says in the message questions and
[1:42:06] answers book one now
[1:42:08] and then at that time see the speaking
[1:42:12] of that time what that time the
[1:42:13] tribulation
[1:42:14] see the gentile bride is in heaven and
[1:42:17] the sleeping virgin the gentile virgin
[1:42:19] is not to be saved during that time
[1:42:23] she's already been saved but has been
[1:42:25] rejected
[1:42:26] in the bride and she only goes through
[1:42:30] the tribulation period
[1:42:32] for the time of purification because she
[1:42:35] has rejected christ
[1:42:36] the word for her purification
[1:42:39] then she has to suffer for her deeds
[1:42:42] but the bride who has become the word
[1:42:46] a complete atonement was made of christ
[1:42:48] because he is the word
[1:42:50] that body was rendered and when that
[1:42:52] body was rendered the bride was in that
[1:42:54] body
[1:42:54] because it's all the word amen you see
[1:42:57] it
[1:42:58] uh the conflict between god and satan
[1:43:00] there's no place
[1:43:02] where the church ever goes through the
[1:43:04] tribulation
[1:43:05] christ's blood and the fullness of the
[1:43:08] application of the blood of jesus christ
[1:43:10] cleanses all sin
[1:43:11] and why do we have to be purged we're
[1:43:13] purged daily we read this no tribulation
[1:43:16] amen the next quotation uh this is from
[1:43:19] questions and answers in 1964
[1:43:22] the question says and of standing in
[1:43:25] line to get into church is going to be
[1:43:26] only a memory
[1:43:28] what is going to happen if we are not
[1:43:29] going through the tribulation
[1:43:31] are we are we to be seen some suffering
[1:43:34] now he's going to answer the question
[1:43:35] directly are we going to see
[1:43:36] suffering now you've got to be careful
[1:43:39] here
[1:43:40] now i know some believers minds
[1:43:42] especially those really studied in the
[1:43:44] message
[1:43:44] their minds are racing what about this
[1:43:46] brother man what about brother benham
[1:43:47] said that
[1:43:48] that you have to really suffer hard and
[1:43:50] and he says all those who are not
[1:43:52] you know uh according to that system you
[1:43:54] got to remember those were
[1:43:55] those were brother adams referring to
[1:43:57] there are believers there are christians
[1:44:00] that go through the tribulation period
[1:44:02] and and so he's referring to some of
[1:44:04] those there's a lot of quotations
[1:44:06] that you could read about because you
[1:44:09] got to remember this and just just just
[1:44:11] give me some grace here this morning to
[1:44:13] stop for a moment and teach on this
[1:44:15] there's there's two schools of thinking
[1:44:17] that you have
[1:44:18] uh people in the message have let me
[1:44:20] give you one school of thinking and i'm
[1:44:22] gonna give you the second one okay
[1:44:23] so just follow this close because both
[1:44:27] schools
[1:44:28] i can i can i can give the example
[1:44:30] brother branham gave when he's
[1:44:31] speaking about calvinism and armenianism
[1:44:34] and he says there's a ditch on the left
[1:44:36] of the road there's a ditch on the right
[1:44:38] of the road
[1:44:39] then there's the middle of the road and
[1:44:40] the truth is in the middle it's not in
[1:44:42] the left edge it's not in the right
[1:44:43] ditch
[1:44:44] and and notice this here
[1:44:48] there's two schools of thinking both are
[1:44:50] wrong here here's one school let me give
[1:44:51] you the first i'm gonna i'm gonna
[1:44:52] describe it to you
[1:44:55] the first school of thinking says there
[1:44:57] is no squeeze
[1:44:59] at all there's no persecution there's
[1:45:02] nothing
[1:45:03] left to happen only the physical return
[1:45:06] of christ
[1:45:08] and 100 percent of the quotes
[1:45:31] hey man i think maybe my audio might be
[1:45:34] out here
[1:45:36] brother jordan we still clear it it's
[1:45:38] got a call here
[1:45:40] you can just you're back okay sounds and
[1:45:42] looks good okay good amen
[1:45:45] so let me know if it goes out again i'll
[1:45:47] just continue
[1:45:48] so so the one school of thought i hope
[1:45:50] you i hope that you heard
[1:45:51] um what i don't know what you missed
[1:45:55] before before i went out i'm not too
[1:45:57] sure so i'll just start where i think
[1:45:59] uh we were i'm not sure what what didn't
[1:46:01] come through but
[1:46:02] i'll just keep reading this i know the
[1:46:04] lord had had me to read this so
[1:46:06] there's there's two schools of thought
[1:46:09] and so
[1:46:10] both schools of thought are wrong let me
[1:46:11] give you the first school of thought
[1:46:13] first school says there's no squeeze
[1:46:15] coming there's no persecution brother
[1:46:17] branham said a lot about the squeeze
[1:46:19] he said a lot about closing a church
[1:46:20] door said a lot of germ warfare but then
[1:46:22] he corrected that later
[1:46:23] and there's nothing coming everything
[1:46:25] we've been doing since the seals has
[1:46:27] just been
[1:46:28] breathing air living dying working and
[1:46:30] and nothing's happening nothing is to
[1:46:32] happen
[1:46:33] just the coming of the lord that's all
[1:46:35] there is left there's nothing else
[1:46:37] coming we don't need to look for
[1:46:38] anything else
[1:46:39] uh everything we've been doing is just
[1:46:41] living dying breathing the only thing
[1:46:43] coming is the event is the one
[1:46:46] event that's the only thing left between
[1:46:48] now and the rapture is the one event
[1:46:51] well that's one school of thinking now
[1:46:54] let me give you the second school of
[1:46:55] thinking
[1:46:56] second school of thinking says there's a
[1:46:59] squeeze coming
[1:47:00] persecution brother adam said watch the
[1:47:02] third pool then watch it you've seen it
[1:47:04] what you've seen in part
[1:47:05] he says you just watched them when that
[1:47:06] little brat is persecuted
[1:47:08] there's there's
[1:47:45] okay got it back okay so just let me
[1:47:49] know if
[1:47:49] if you lose me again brother jordan not
[1:47:51] sure what's happening here i could try
[1:47:53] even killing my video if you think that
[1:47:54] would help
[1:47:55] maybe it's a bandwidth problem not
[1:47:57] really sure
[1:47:58] um but but the the second school let me
[1:48:02] just
[1:48:03] let me uh let me just start back up the
[1:48:05] second school says
[1:48:08] uh you know that that that there's a
[1:48:10] squeeze a coming plagues are falling
[1:48:12] they're going to squeeze the bride into
[1:48:14] believing for a rapture
[1:48:15] our bodies can't even change believers
[1:48:18] bodies people are looking for a body
[1:48:19] change and that's not even
[1:48:20] you can't even look for that because the
[1:48:22] squeeze hasn't happened yet i heard one
[1:48:24] minister say that i
[1:48:25] i can't preach to you that the your
[1:48:26] bodies are going to change tomorrow that
[1:48:28] they can change any minute and that's
[1:48:29] directly contrary to everything brother
[1:48:30] brandon ever
[1:48:31] said our bodies can't change the rapture
[1:48:34] can't happen miracles can't even take
[1:48:36] place
[1:48:36] there's no real power for the believer
[1:48:38] until the squeeze comes brother man
[1:48:41] watch the third pull then watch the
[1:48:42] council begins to tighten up
[1:48:44] we're all just waiting to be hunted down
[1:48:46] like dogs
[1:48:47] laws will change they'll shut the doors
[1:48:49] of our churches
[1:48:51] now listen this is no different than the
[1:48:53] spirit of return ministry
[1:48:55] who says we're just waiting on brother
[1:48:56] branham to come back can't really do
[1:48:57] nothing need to wait for him to
[1:48:59] fulfillment my brother my sister you
[1:49:00] missed the message
[1:49:01] you missed the whole point uh uh god's
[1:49:05] god didn't make an
[1:49:06] accident there wasn't a mistake that
[1:49:08] took place
[1:49:09] everything's on time according to god
[1:49:16] so so the the
[1:49:19] here's here's what i know now let me
[1:49:21] just stop here for a moment and say this
[1:49:24] you have to remember that it was it was
[1:49:26] the captivity
[1:49:29] it was the captivity of god's people
[1:49:34] that caused daniel to be it was the
[1:49:36] captivity the suffering it was the
[1:49:38] the bad situation it was the pressure in
[1:49:41] the world
[1:49:42] that caused a man named daniel to begin
[1:49:44] to read
[1:49:45] and the bible says he understood by
[1:49:48] books
[1:49:49] that the desolation of jerusalem was
[1:49:51] almost over
[1:49:54] and and and and and notice this here
[1:49:58] much like that if anything
[1:50:01] this pandemic has done as
[1:50:05] it's caused us to reevaluate the subject
[1:50:09] of the coming of the lord
[1:50:11] to dig in to take a fresh look into the
[1:50:14] word that was sent to us because we
[1:50:16] don't tend to discuss these kind of
[1:50:17] things in times of peace
[1:50:20] we don't even think about them in times
[1:50:21] of peace and calm what we call normal
[1:50:23] times
[1:50:24] what i also know is that we have to be
[1:50:27] so
[1:50:27] careful as ministers we have to be so
[1:50:30] careful in how we draw lines
[1:50:34] and our understanding of subjects like
[1:50:37] these
[1:50:38] it doesn't mean that we can't draw lines
[1:50:41] meaning definite definitive conclusions
[1:50:44] but we need to be careful how we draw
[1:50:46] them
[1:50:47] lest we think that we have all the
[1:50:49] answers
[1:50:51] lest we think that that we know
[1:50:53] everything you know i i just test
[1:50:55] witness to you here today i
[1:50:57] i begin to put a document together and i
[1:51:00] titled that document
[1:51:01] what's next question mark what's next
[1:51:04] and i i my intent the goal the motive
[1:51:08] was
[1:51:08] i wanted to compile a document of
[1:51:10] everything that happens
[1:51:12] uh at the coming of the lord we have the
[1:51:14] rapture then and put it in chronological
[1:51:16] timeline of
[1:51:16] this is what happens the the dead saints
[1:51:19] raised and then
[1:51:20] jesus uh reappears then we're here for
[1:51:22] 30 to 40 days and then we meet him in
[1:51:23] there then what happens after the
[1:51:25] rapture then
[1:51:25] the plagues start to fall california
[1:51:27] this is where california fits in this is
[1:51:29] where the
[1:51:29] world council of churches who the rome
[1:51:32] who controls the politics and begins to
[1:51:34] shut the churches down this is when that
[1:51:35] happens
[1:51:36] this is when the prophets appear this is
[1:51:38] when judgment day happens
[1:51:39] this is the bema the when the reward
[1:51:41] ceremony happens this is when
[1:51:43] the millennium happens this is and i
[1:51:44] wanted to put everything in a
[1:51:46] chronological order so that i can look
[1:51:47] into the timeline
[1:51:49] good good idea said but then that wow
[1:51:51] boy i'd pay money for that
[1:51:53] document i bet you would
[1:51:56] i began to realize as i began to compile
[1:51:58] it the lord just spoke to me
[1:52:01] and stopped me and said that's not how
[1:52:04] i've designed it
[1:52:05] i don't want you to be able to
[1:52:07] mathematically calculate everything
[1:52:09] that's going to happen now
[1:52:11] doesn't mean we don't know some things
[1:52:13] doesn't mean we don't know we can't
[1:52:14] discern the times and
[1:52:16] seasons but the bible says this in the
[1:52:19] book of acts
[1:52:20] of the times and the seasons god has put
[1:52:22] it in his own
[1:52:23] power and god begged to stop me and said
[1:52:27] that's not how i've designed this
[1:52:29] brother branham said over and over and
[1:52:30] over again
[1:52:31] god interprets his word by
[1:52:34] bringing it to pass
[1:52:37] so you say brother matt what does that
[1:52:38] mean that means that god didn't intend
[1:52:41] for us to all figure we don't know
[1:52:43] everything god didn't intend for us to
[1:52:45] have every
[1:52:46] every single question that we could
[1:52:48] possibly have answered and we know it
[1:52:50] all we're just know-it-alls
[1:52:52] because i believe that the lord always
[1:52:55] leaves up that he said but the matter
[1:52:56] does that mean we just don't figure out
[1:52:57] anything no that's not what i'm saying
[1:52:59] i believe we should be sober we should
[1:53:01] be vigilant we should we should be sober
[1:53:03] minded
[1:53:03] studying staying in the word of god
[1:53:05] finding out everything we possibly can
[1:53:07] looking into the message
[1:53:09] but i believe that there are certain
[1:53:11] things god leaves a portion
[1:53:14] of things to be interpreted by bringing
[1:53:16] it to pass
[1:53:19] and and and i believe that there are
[1:53:21] some things we know
[1:53:24] because we can know them and there are
[1:53:27] certain things that we
[1:53:28] don't know because we can't know and god
[1:53:31] doesn't want us to know right now
[1:53:34] even the seventh seal how do you
[1:53:36] remember the portion of the seventh seal
[1:53:38] that brother branham said it was silence
[1:53:40] it was the coming of the lord and and
[1:53:41] there was
[1:53:42] there was a phase of you know the third
[1:53:43] pool that was in an unknown tongue and
[1:53:45] couldn't be interpreted why do you think
[1:53:47] well there was no interpreter it was
[1:53:49] unknown because
[1:53:50] even the seventh seal has an element or
[1:53:53] a fold to it brother adam said that we
[1:53:54] don't understand
[1:53:55] that would include the coming of the
[1:53:57] lord the rapture of the church
[1:53:59] god will unfold these things in time by
[1:54:02] bringing it to pass as brother branham
[1:54:04] said over
[1:54:05] and over and over and over
[1:54:09] yet we have to realize as mature sons
[1:54:12] and daughters of god
[1:54:14] that at the same time we have to realize
[1:54:16] our position that god has
[1:54:18] called us to for such a time as this is
[1:54:21] to rightly divide the word
[1:54:23] and the present events and the current
[1:54:25] events happening to
[1:54:26] rightly divide it based upon the word
[1:54:29] that we've been given
[1:54:30] so there's a balance as we said a left
[1:54:32] and a right ditch
[1:54:35] and what we have to realize many are
[1:54:37] running to and fro
[1:54:38] and being tossed by every wind of
[1:54:40] doctrine but god has given us the
[1:54:42] stabilizer of our faith and that's the
[1:54:44] revelation of the word of the hour
[1:54:46] brother adam says in broken cisterns
[1:54:49] someone called me not long ago
[1:54:51] from up in the east and said brother
[1:54:52] branham i hear you've moved out to
[1:54:54] arizona
[1:54:55] and you've formed a place where there
[1:54:58] there's a safety whether there's there's
[1:55:00] safety
[1:55:01] and as you know how the message come and
[1:55:02] the lord told me what would happen in
[1:55:04] alaska and
[1:55:05] how down through california it would be
[1:55:07] and it's just been that way
[1:55:08] they said now if that's shaking and
[1:55:11] everything
[1:55:12] where is the safety zone brother branham
[1:55:14] where
[1:55:15] they were looking for a physical
[1:55:16] location where can we live what do we do
[1:55:19] brother branham says there's only one
[1:55:21] safety zone that i know
[1:55:23] that's in christ for those
[1:55:26] that are in christ are safe
[1:55:30] oh brother branham says in seed of
[1:55:32] discrepancy
[1:55:33] we find out god gave his children
[1:55:36] the best word that he says he says we
[1:55:39] find out god gave his children his word
[1:55:41] for their defense we have no other
[1:55:44] defense
[1:55:45] than the word of god that is our defense
[1:55:48] and there's no bombs no
[1:55:49] shelters no hiding place no arizona's
[1:55:52] california's
[1:55:53] or whatever it is there's there's only
[1:55:55] one defense we have and that's the word
[1:55:58] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:56:00] among us
[1:56:00] which is christ jesus he is our only
[1:56:03] defense
[1:56:04] being in him we are
[1:56:07] safe so what we realize is that even in
[1:56:11] the ministry of brother branham
[1:56:12] there was a changing where he he begins
[1:56:16] to
[1:56:16] uh we we understand that something takes
[1:56:19] place
[1:56:20] but both supernaturally and naturally
[1:56:24] when christ was put out of the church
[1:56:27] in revelations uh chapter three the
[1:56:30] bible says
[1:56:30] you know that the the behold i stand at
[1:56:33] the door and knock
[1:56:35] so something happened in our in our age
[1:56:38] in our time in our generation
[1:56:40] where christ was put outside of the
[1:56:42] church and something
[1:56:44] naturally happened and something
[1:56:46] spiritually
[1:56:47] happened as well that that god
[1:56:50] called out a bride out of that church
[1:56:52] that had put him out
[1:56:54] so you see that the quotes that you can
[1:56:57] have and there you can give me hundreds
[1:56:58] of them
[1:56:59] uh brother random refers to a
[1:57:01] persecution and he says it this way
[1:57:04] he says there will come a persecution to
[1:57:06] run us together
[1:57:08] and and they they're they're all of
[1:57:10] those quotes that brother brandon
[1:57:12] mentions that there's come into
[1:57:13] persecution they'll run us together and
[1:57:15] they'll run us together and there's
[1:57:16] coming a squeeze all of those
[1:57:18] quotes that you read are in the context
[1:57:22] of brother branham having a
[1:57:24] church world view of the book of
[1:57:28] revelations
[1:57:29] remember after the seals brother branham
[1:57:31] says the bible became a brand new book
[1:57:34] so what was it pre-seals it was a church
[1:57:37] view it was a denominational view he
[1:57:39] even had the white horse writer
[1:57:41] this shouldn't be new to you as message
[1:57:43] believers this cover and some of this
[1:57:45] should be reviewed
[1:57:46] but but brother branham even had the
[1:57:48] white horse writer as christ
[1:57:49] he said he had it totally wrong even
[1:57:51] before he goes to preach the seals
[1:57:54] brother brandon says i had it all wrong
[1:57:55] he said then the angel met me there in
[1:57:57] that back room
[1:57:58] each night the angel lord would come and
[1:58:00] correct him
[1:58:01] and give him the interpretation of that
[1:58:03] seal he was going to preach
[1:58:04] brother man says i would have made an
[1:58:06] awful mistake i would have made a
[1:58:07] horrible mistake had it not been for the
[1:58:10] lord
[1:58:11] so when you so you say brother matt what
[1:58:14] does that mean that that means that all
[1:58:15] the quotes you read about persecution
[1:58:17] coming
[1:58:18] he's he sees the book of revelations he
[1:58:20] even applies the tribulation
[1:58:22] to to groups that he misapplied it to or
[1:58:25] reap or or reapply it to
[1:58:27] after the seals and questions and
[1:58:28] answers even
[1:58:30] even the feast of the trumpets brother
[1:58:32] brandon thought himself that was for the
[1:58:33] gentiles that was for the
[1:58:34] for the bride until god corrects him has
[1:58:37] a plane ticket to go to israel
[1:58:39] and god correct him says it's not the
[1:58:41] time and it's not your place
[1:58:45] even before the seals brother i mean
[1:58:46] before a feast of the trumpets
[1:58:48] and so he he has a church view of the
[1:58:51] book of revelations
[1:58:52] and he was trying to break down
[1:58:54] denominational barriers that was his
[1:58:57] that was his motive there will be a
[1:58:59] persecution
[1:59:00] brother man when that persecution comes
[1:59:02] then all of our barriers will drop down
[1:59:04] and all run us all together baptist with
[1:59:06] pentecostals with methodists with
[1:59:08] lutherans with church of christ church
[1:59:09] of god
[1:59:10] all of us will run together there's got
[1:59:11] to be a unity there's got to be a unity
[1:59:16] but then he comes and he preaches a
[1:59:18] message
[1:59:19] the seed shall not be air with the shock
[1:59:24] there had to be of necessity
[1:59:27] a pulling away of the shock from the
[1:59:31] seed
[1:59:32] not just naturally not just a natural
[1:59:35] separation
[1:59:36] where doors were closed to the prophet
[1:59:38] pulpits shut him out
[1:59:39] the world shut him out that was not just
[1:59:41] naturally that was spiritually that was
[1:59:43] christ being put
[1:59:44] out of the church not that brother
[1:59:45] branham was christ
[1:59:47] physically he was jesus christ it was
[1:59:49] the word that was rejected not a man
[1:59:52] it wasn't brother branham who they
[1:59:53] rejected they rejected christ the word
[1:59:57] wouldn't have been insignificant how
[1:59:58] they rejected that oh
[2:00:00] now now it was it was at this
[2:00:03] point that brother branham becomes the
[2:00:06] voice
[2:00:07] his voice he becomes the voice the man
[2:00:10] he becomes the fulfillment of the voice
[2:00:12] of revelations 14 18 4
[2:00:16] where where revelations 18 4 and i heard
[2:00:18] another voice from heaven
[2:00:20] saying come out of her my people
[2:00:23] that you be not partakers of her sins
[2:00:26] that you receive
[2:00:27] not her plagues we must
[2:00:31] as believers realize that just
[2:00:34] as the seals were a milestone for the
[2:00:38] prophet
[2:00:38] a marker a junction the feast of the
[2:00:42] trumpets
[2:00:43] were as well even in the feast of the
[2:00:46] trumpets
[2:00:47] something changed in the way the prophet
[2:00:49] applied
[2:00:50] specifics concerning the squeeze or the
[2:00:53] persecution to run us together
[2:00:55] he realized god did not intend
[2:00:59] to run us together with the rest of the
[2:01:02] church world
[2:01:03] but to separate us separated people unto
[2:01:06] himself
[2:01:07] and bring the bride together not to a
[2:01:10] spirit not to a physical place
[2:01:12] but a spiritual atmosphere of safety
[2:01:16] in christ so this this brother
[2:01:20] who listen to what brother adam says
[2:01:22] here and he says this is this is uh you
[2:01:24] have the quotations brother jordan for
[2:01:26] this
[2:01:26] um you have the quotations for this you
[2:01:30] can you can display if you want
[2:01:32] he's asked the question and standing in
[2:01:34] line to get to church there's not going
[2:01:35] to be a memory
[2:01:36] are we going to have to go through
[2:01:37] suffering if we're not deceit brother
[2:01:38] madam says now
[2:01:40] now this question is probably this i'm
[2:01:42] trying to hurry i ought not to do this
[2:01:44] ought to lay these back because there's
[2:01:46] a place you could stay in
[2:01:47] on an hour and just tear it down i'll
[2:01:49] just stop i'll stop
[2:01:51] and he says look the people are wanting
[2:01:54] to
[2:01:55] say now notice this is after notice
[2:01:58] the date 1964 questions and answers this
[2:02:01] is
[2:02:01] after the feast of the trumpets at the
[2:02:04] feast of the trumpets you go and look up
[2:02:05] the quotes that's the quote we
[2:02:07] read brother branham says he says why
[2:02:09] would a man a husband
[2:02:10] for his wife put her through a bunch of
[2:02:12] suffering she's already found grace in
[2:02:13] his sight
[2:02:14] so brother madam shifts his entire view
[2:02:17] and the feast of the trumpets
[2:02:19] and and you know why because brother
[2:02:20] branham says that the angel of the lord
[2:02:23] met him in his room he comes to his wife
[2:02:25] go read the beginning of the feast of
[2:02:26] the trumpets
[2:02:27] he comes and says honey i would have
[2:02:28] gotten it all wrong he said the lord
[2:02:30] showed up and totally changed it for me
[2:02:33] now listen to what he's going to answer
[2:02:35] to this question are we going to go
[2:02:36] through suffering this is this is
[2:02:38] questions and answers
[2:02:39] are we going to go through suffering
[2:02:41] brother branham says look the people are
[2:02:43] wanting to say that
[2:02:45] thinking the church is going to hit the
[2:02:47] tribulation see
[2:02:49] it won't it can't
[2:02:52] because it's already redeemed now the
[2:02:56] church
[2:02:57] the nominal believers like lot he's
[2:02:59] going through the tribulation period
[2:03:02] and be saved as if it was by
[2:03:05] fire noah went through the tribulation
[2:03:08] period
[2:03:08] carried above it come out with ham who
[2:03:11] polluted the earth again see
[2:03:13] lot came out his daughter slept with him
[2:03:15] had children by his own daughter see but
[2:03:17] abraham brought forth the royal seed
[2:03:20] brought forth the seed of promise enoch
[2:03:22] went to glory in the rapture
[2:03:23] just took a walk and went home he never
[2:03:25] went through the tribulation period you
[2:03:27] see there you
[2:03:28] are see the bible cannot be by type
[2:03:31] and this this types can't fail see
[2:03:34] it does not predict that the bride now
[2:03:38] the church
[2:03:39] will go through the tribulation period
[2:03:42] now the people say
[2:03:43] what about the early saints that was the
[2:03:45] changing
[2:03:46] of the dispensation they were martyred
[2:03:48] they were persecuted even today there's
[2:03:50] persecution in other countries
[2:03:52] but that's not what's bringing
[2:03:53] perfection for rapturing faith
[2:03:55] brother adam says that was under
[2:03:56] persecution which is if you were here to
[2:03:59] hear this church jesus to see how they
[2:04:00] went under the darkness
[2:04:01] and he says i had to do that then that
[2:04:04] shows where they had take where had they
[2:04:06] had to take the persecution because each
[2:04:07] one of the church ages
[2:04:09] everything began to show that they were
[2:04:10] under the darker that they went darker
[2:04:12] and darker till they finally went into a
[2:04:14] complete place that they denied his name
[2:04:16] and picked up another name and they
[2:04:17] lived and they were dead sardis
[2:04:19] and then it come on out of that thiatira
[2:04:21] sardis then come out of that then it
[2:04:22] began to come out to the philadelphia
[2:04:24] and so forth and then come to the time
[2:04:26] of the calling of the bride
[2:04:27] which was to escape
[2:04:30] all the damnation it counted worthy to
[2:04:34] escape
[2:04:36] all a l l
[2:04:39] this damnation and wrath that's to come
[2:04:42] upon the earth that you might be
[2:04:44] counted worthy to escape it not
[2:04:47] go through it escape it
[2:04:52] do you understand everybody the
[2:04:55] church the lukewarm the anything
[2:04:59] outside of the elected bride but the ma
[2:05:01] who is the elected bride
[2:05:03] is it all those at tucson tabernacle is
[2:05:05] it all those at this church
[2:05:06] is it all those who say they believe a
[2:05:08] prophet is it all those who have message
[2:05:10] books in their homes no doesn't do you
[2:05:11] a bit of good no association
[2:05:15] no organization will save you no
[2:05:17] preaching will save you no prophesied
[2:05:19] will save you no gifts will save you no
[2:05:21] healing will save you
[2:05:22] no resurrection will save you that
[2:05:23] doesn't put you into the bride
[2:05:25] there will be many who miss the rapture
[2:05:28] that that foolish virgin will be made up
[2:05:30] of
[2:05:30] of anyone without the baptism of the
[2:05:32] holy ghost
[2:05:33] and it will not discriminate based upon
[2:05:36] whose church you go to or who your daddy
[2:05:38] was or who your mommy was or who your
[2:05:39] grandfather was or your grandmother was
[2:05:41] it won't discriminate it looks at one
[2:05:43] thing the blood
[2:05:46] that's why the message of today is you
[2:05:47] must be born again
[2:05:49] born by the spirit of god you don't get
[2:05:52] that by believing you say how am i born
[2:05:54] again by believing the message no
[2:05:56] that devils believe and tremble it's by
[2:05:58] a baptism of the holy ghost that you
[2:06:01] know that you know that you know that
[2:06:02] you met god
[2:06:03] by a pentecostal experience you say what
[2:06:05] is pentecost it's an experience
[2:06:07] it's different for everybody not the
[2:06:08] same for for one maybe
[2:06:10] maybe one it's just something that
[2:06:11] settles down inside of their heart maybe
[2:06:13] it's another they speak in tongues maybe
[2:06:15] another
[2:06:15] brother brandon it feels like water on
[2:06:17] your back maybe for another you pick up
[2:06:18] a piece of paper and
[2:06:19] you've been changed from that point on
[2:06:20] it's different for everybody
[2:06:23] but but here's what you know you make
[2:06:25] sure you got it
[2:06:26] make sure you know that you know that
[2:06:27] you know that should not hope so
[2:06:30] but that you got to know so in your life
[2:06:34] he says the church the lukewarm anything
[2:06:36] outside of the elected bride will go
[2:06:39] through the tribulation period
[2:06:42] very clear very clear they will not
[2:06:45] raise in the first resurrection and he
[2:06:48] quotes the rest of the dead live
[2:06:49] not for a thousand years so they miss
[2:06:51] the millennium they raise up after
[2:06:54] just the four ordained predestinated
[2:06:56] elected bride
[2:06:57] god's own election who is it brother
[2:07:00] branham i love this
[2:07:01] who is it brother branham i don't know i
[2:07:04] can't tell you who it is
[2:07:06] but i know it's going to be there
[2:07:08] because the lord said they would
[2:07:10] they are the ones who that'll go up from
[2:07:12] the tribulation but the rest of them
[2:07:14] will go through the tribulation
[2:07:16] go down and everything will be killed
[2:07:17] before the millennium then the righteous
[2:07:19] will come out in the millennium
[2:07:21] and live a thousand years my brother my
[2:07:23] sister if brother brandon was asked the
[2:07:25] question today he'd answer it the exact
[2:07:27] same way the squeeze people have looked
[2:07:31] for
[2:07:32] happens in the tribulation brother
[2:07:34] brandon makes it clear in the feast of
[2:07:36] the trumpets that the bride receives her
[2:07:38] squeeze
[2:07:38] in an ecclesiastical manner while it's
[2:07:41] israel who receives it in a
[2:07:43] physical manner the church will go
[2:07:46] through that time but
[2:07:47] not the bride he says it over and over
[2:07:49] again you say brother matt what is the
[2:07:51] ecclesiastical squeeze
[2:07:53] is a spirit that's been loosed upon the
[2:07:55] bride to try to kill the anointing
[2:07:57] to try to stifle the life in the church
[2:07:59] to try to make
[2:08:00] our message a dead formal religion where
[2:08:03] we're dead
[2:08:04] formal church members where we come to
[2:08:06] dead churches with no life
[2:08:07] no joy no love that's the ecclesiastical
[2:08:11] squeeze
[2:08:12] that's that's the delilah that's upon
[2:08:15] you church
[2:08:16] it's to try to destroy the anointing try
[2:08:18] to destroy the gifts of the spirit
[2:08:20] try to hush out divine healing try to
[2:08:22] put out the fire of the holy ghost
[2:08:24] get rid of prayer lines get rid of altar
[2:08:26] calls get rid of real lively worship
[2:08:28] where you worship god in spirit and in
[2:08:30] truth and in passion
[2:08:32] remember the math is that is it
[2:08:34] coronavirus that we need to fear no my
[2:08:36] brother it's that's the virus you need
[2:08:38] to fear
[2:08:40] that's the one we need to fight against
[2:08:41] and be concerned about
[2:08:43] one who tries to kill the reality of the
[2:08:46] living fire breathing holy ghost-filled
[2:08:48] church
[2:08:50] glory brother branham says he says that
[2:08:53] it says loose in the ecclesiastical
[2:08:55] church spirit loosed upon what
[2:08:56] this is feast of the trumpets not upon
[2:08:58] the denominations upon the bride
[2:09:01] but here you'll get it the bride will
[2:09:03] not go through
[2:09:04] that time the bible says not the church
[2:09:07] will but
[2:09:07] not the bride can't you see it ministers
[2:09:11] can't you see it brethren you say the
[2:09:14] church has to go through the persecution
[2:09:16] for the perfection of it and then he
[2:09:18] says the blood
[2:09:19] of jesus christ perfects the bride
[2:09:23] glory uh brother and sister we can put
[2:09:26] in hundreds of quotes
[2:09:27] that say the same exact thing oh you say
[2:09:30] brother matt well you just got to have
[2:09:32] revelation
[2:09:33] you've got to read between the lines you
[2:09:34] got to it's not exactly there i know
[2:09:36] i know brother branham never said that
[2:09:37] the rapture was spiritual the
[2:09:39] resurrection was spiritual
[2:09:40] i know he never really said those things
[2:09:42] i know it there's no no he didn't say
[2:09:44] those things he didn't even say anything
[2:09:45] close
[2:09:46] to that not even remotely attached to
[2:09:48] that not even close
[2:09:50] oh the resurrection's spiritual it's not
[2:09:52] natural it's not physical
[2:09:54] it doesn't really happen the coming of
[2:09:55] the lord jesus everyone's looking for a
[2:09:57] literal
[2:09:57] coming of jesus it's not going to happen
[2:09:59] it's all spiritual it's not really there
[2:10:01] we've all missed it
[2:10:02] i i know i know that brother adam never
[2:10:05] said that brother matt you got to read
[2:10:06] between the lines
[2:10:07] you've got to you've got to you've got
[2:10:09] in order to have revelation you've got
[2:10:10] to read between the lines in order to
[2:10:12] see the picture
[2:10:13] listen to me brother and sister i love
[2:10:15] reading between the lines
[2:10:16] but what we read between the lines
[2:10:21] must still be in agreement with what's
[2:10:24] on the lines
[2:10:29] and many times people assert and presume
[2:10:31] things that are nowhere close to
[2:10:33] anything brother branham ever taught we
[2:10:36] must stick with what's on
[2:10:39] the tapes not our ideas not our opinions
[2:10:43] we check our opinions and ideas with the
[2:10:46] word
[2:10:46] and when they disagree with the word we
[2:10:48] chuck out our opinions
[2:10:50] oh scripture tells us that the the
[2:10:53] brother
[2:10:54] says oh scripture tells us that the dead
[2:10:56] in christ would rise first and and he
[2:10:58] said the brother went on to say the dead
[2:10:59] in christ have indeed risen and we
[2:11:01] missed it because we
[2:11:02] it didn't come as we we expected it
[2:11:05] my brother uh to believe this way is a
[2:11:08] is a gross
[2:11:10] uh uh misunderstanding it's directly
[2:11:13] contrary to what brother branham taught
[2:11:15] or what the bible teaches
[2:11:16] that teaching can't be substantiated
[2:11:19] with any quotes
[2:11:20] or scriptures it simply can be
[2:11:22] substantiated by one thing
[2:11:24] man's opinions and let me just say this
[2:11:27] you're welcome to your opinions
[2:11:29] but i'll i'll stick with the word of god
[2:11:32] i'll stick with the word of god oh
[2:11:34] brother madam says three kinds of
[2:11:36] believers
[2:11:37] listen to this i hope you got it
[2:11:39] displayed brother jordan if you don't
[2:11:40] it's fine
[2:11:41] i hope you got a display for those at
[2:11:42] least in church three kinds of believers
[2:11:44] 1963 listen what brother branham says
[2:11:46] that's the reason
[2:11:47] i do believe that when the bride is
[2:11:49] called out and elected
[2:11:51] and said in the book of life there will
[2:11:53] come a sound from heaven
[2:11:55] that will take such a baptism of the
[2:11:57] holy spirit into that bride
[2:11:59] that will take her from the earth in a
[2:12:02] rapturing grace
[2:12:04] notice what he doesn't say he doesn't
[2:12:06] say that i believe that
[2:12:07] there will come a there will come a
[2:12:09] sound of coronavirus there will come the
[2:12:11] sound of to russian troops there will
[2:12:12] come a
[2:12:13] sound of a you in and chinese soldier
[2:12:15] marching there will come a sound of a
[2:12:17] shortage of food a shortage of coins
[2:12:19] and then that'll put the bride no my
[2:12:21] brother my sister that's not word of war
[2:12:23] to be looking to
[2:12:24] he says there will come a sound from
[2:12:25] heaven that will take such a baptism of
[2:12:28] the holy spirit
[2:12:29] they don't take her from off the earth i
[2:12:31] say lord send it like
[2:12:32] rain o god send that rushing mighty wind
[2:12:35] of the baptism of the holy ghost that
[2:12:37] will take your people off the earth

[2:12:42] god
[2:12:43] promised it now listen he says i don't
[2:12:46] care how much science
[2:12:48] how many astronauts they signed up and
[2:12:50] everything else
[2:12:51] how many millions of miles they can see
[2:12:53] i don't care nothing about it
[2:12:55] there is a heaven and
[2:12:58] there is a jesus
[2:13:02] christ there that will come
[2:13:05] in a body form to receive his church
[2:13:08] let me read it again there is a heaven
[2:13:11] and there is a literal
[2:13:12] jesus christ that will come in a body
[2:13:15] form
[2:13:16] to receive his church to himself no
[2:13:19] matter how old the story
[2:13:22] seems it's still
[2:13:25] the truth god said so and that's what

[2:17:31] he was identifying something and there
[2:17:34] was an age of neurotics there was an age
[2:17:36] that was going insane but then there was
[2:17:38] a people
[2:17:39] there was a people who feared the lord
[2:17:41] they spoke often one to another
[2:17:44] oh you're just speaking about the
[2:17:46] goodness of god speaking about the word
[2:17:48] of god
[2:17:49] uh speaking about about what the word
[2:17:52] means to you a constant inspiration and
[2:17:54] flow of the spirit

[2:18:00] to another
[2:18:01] and the lord hearkened he hearkened he
[2:18:04] had drew him something about that drew
[2:18:06] him
[2:18:07] and the bible says and he heard it and a
[2:18:10] book of remembrance you think
[2:18:11] you think that your your deeds that you
[2:18:13] live in your flesh mean nothing to god
[2:18:15] brother branham said they're written
[2:18:16] down in the book
[2:18:18] he says a book of remembrance was
[2:18:20] written before him
[2:18:21] for them that feared the lord
[2:18:25] and i love this and that thought upon
[2:18:28] his name
[2:18:30] i just thought of that scripture as i
[2:18:31] was reading it last night i said lord
[2:18:34] let me be maybe you can just bow your
[2:18:36] heads with me here across the building
[2:18:38] every head bowed ever i closed

[2:18:41] an uplifted hand say lord
[2:18:43] i want to think about your name daily
[2:18:46] lord
[2:18:46] i want to remember you so that you'll
[2:18:49] remember me

[2:18:53] and he says the voice of he says oh the
[2:18:56] voice of
[2:18:57] uh uh uh of of jesus
[2:19:00] brother and picks that up and he says oh
[2:19:02] he says i will put
[2:19:04] i will put upon you no none other burden
[2:19:08] oh brother branham begins to pick that
[2:19:10] up and and he says there's no
[2:19:12] there's no voice he says like that voice
[2:19:16] there's no
[2:19:17] he says everyone man loves to hear a
[2:19:19] claim they love to hear his name
[2:19:20] brother adam says man loves to hear his
[2:19:22] name spoken over a pulpit or
[2:19:25] if i was to say your name this morning
[2:19:26] it'd bring and bring joy to you to have
[2:19:28] your name mentioned
[2:19:29] in public it brother branham says it
[2:19:31] just brings such a a sweet feeling when
[2:19:33] someone mentions your name
[2:19:35] in front of others brother adam says
[2:19:38] there's he says oh but my brother my
[2:19:39] sister
[2:19:40] there will be no sweeter feeling than
[2:19:43] when when you hear the name
[2:19:44] at that great white throne he says when
[2:19:46] jesus speaks your name
[2:19:48] and says there was brother aaron there
[2:19:50] was brother peter there was brother
[2:19:51] jordan there was brother matt
[2:19:52] oh there was brother paul oh there was
[2:19:55] brother lyle there was
[2:19:56] oh he begins to speak the name
[2:19:59] oh there was this sister and that
[2:20:02] brother and this sister
[2:20:03] and brother and says when he began to
[2:20:05] speak that name and he says they stood
[2:20:07] for me on earth and now i'll stand for
[2:20:09] them
[2:20:10] they weren't ashamed of me and i'm not
[2:20:12] going to be ashamed of them
[2:20:13] brother branham says there will be no
[2:20:14] sweeter voice no sweeter time you hear
[2:20:17] your name called
[2:20:18] than when jesus calls your name i'll
[2:20:21] begin to think about that lord
[2:20:23] you're writing a book of remembrance for
[2:20:25] those that fear your name that speak to
[2:20:27] one another often
[2:20:28] oh and a book was written for them that
[2:20:32] feared the lord and
[2:20:32] thought upon his name and then you stop
[2:20:35] lord and i just want this to be said of
[2:20:37] me
[2:20:38] maybe someone here could raise their
[2:20:39] hand they could think of their family

[2:20:44] maybe mother you want to say lord let
