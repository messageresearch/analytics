[33:41] is on my place
[33:46] [Music]
[34:02] foreign
[34:03] [Music]
[34:15] I wanted to say thank you so much for
[34:18] praying I know there's many of you that
[34:20] have been asking the family and myself
[34:21] how things are going and by God's grace
[34:25] I'm still here
[34:27] doing well
[34:28] um as you probably heard I had a massive
[34:32] issue come up last month with my clinic
[34:35] and they decided to terminate my
[34:38] treatment both with my doctor and the
[34:40] clinic and they gave me a 30-day notice
[34:42] to find a new place to run and they've
[34:44] made it very difficult for me to do that
[34:47] so we started to pray and just asking
[34:50] the Lord plus the treatments themselves
[34:52] have been really difficult
[34:53] but thank God last week I got notice
[34:56] from some physicians in a group that do
[35:00] serve our Clinic
[35:01] and they're willing to take my care
[35:04] and so for now I won't have any
[35:07] uninterrupted care which is what we were
[35:10] praying for the most it's very critical
[35:12] I have to go from one day to the next
[35:16] you know with the treatments I really
[35:18] can't spend more than three days off of
[35:20] treatment so that is a complete answer
[35:23] to prayer really given me a lot of
[35:26] um hope that you know this is going to
[35:27] get worked out and the other thing is I
[35:30] hadn't had several well it's almost been
[35:33] a year now one of my levels had gone
[35:36] way out of bounds and it affects bone
[35:39] health and skin health and things like
[35:42] this I was given the wrong dose of
[35:44] medication for almost over a year before
[35:46] I was able to get it corrected and I've
[35:48] been praying and praying about those
[35:49] things and always My Confession has been
[35:52] that the Lord will keep these things
[35:54] under under control because they're you
[35:56] know you're fighting sickness it's
[35:58] anything that can go wrong
[36:00] and just this past week I got the lab
[36:03] report back that it had dropped by 600
[36:06] points and I've been praying for that
[36:08] we've been working with some medication
[36:10] and things and that's just a real big
[36:12] Comfort to my heart to know that that
[36:15] range is back where heading back down to
[36:17] where it should be
[36:18] so I just want to give God praise and
[36:22] also thank you very much for praying
[36:24] keeping me in prayer I still have
[36:25] several things coming up in this next
[36:27] week's a few weeks here I have to do a
[36:30] lot of things with the State Department
[36:32] of Health a lot of things with my
[36:34] management I have to meet these new
[36:36] doctors set up new orders it's quite a
[36:38] lot so if you would still continue to
[36:40] keep me in prayer but I know that I've
[36:42] always I just felt the Lord speak to me
[36:44] a lot in these last few weeks reminding
[36:46] me who's your source
[36:48] you know it's not the clinic that keeps
[36:49] you safe it's not the treatment that
[36:51] keeps you alive it's not you know those
[36:53] things help and they're in place by
[36:55] God's grace but it's his hand in his
[36:57] Mercy his breath of life that gives us
[36:59] and all our hope and so I'm
[37:03] um just trying to Anchor myself again in
[37:05] the promises that the lord gave me for
[37:07] full healing and this song after brother
[37:10] Daniel asked if I would sing I had this
[37:12] song in my heart Whispering hope and
[37:14] it's meant a lot to me over the years to
[37:16] sing this song but one of the things
[37:18] that I realized I used to wonder about
[37:19] Hope and one day I had to realize that
[37:22] before you can have faith you have to
[37:24] have hope if you lose your hope for
[37:26] something you can't have faith for it
[37:27] and for me hope really became something
[37:30] important to hold on to so I hope this
[37:33] is a blessing
[37:35] foreign
[37:41] [Music]
[38:01] hope with the gentleman's wish
[38:12] wait till the darkness

[42:34] I had my 40th birthday 14 years ago
[42:37] [Music]
[42:38] that's it I was gonna make a major
[42:41] decision
[42:43] and have someone not be in my life
[42:48] and uh it was so cold I was so
[42:52] far away from Jesus
[42:55] and on that day

[48:39] and he will he's a father that cares for
[48:41] his own
[48:42] a matter so thank you
[48:46] you may be seated just for a moment here
[48:50] see brother Jonathan's not here but
[48:53] brother Jonathan has been helping this
[48:55] past week he spent the day with my dad
[48:58] we were going to have to get some
[49:00] full-time care and brother Jonathan we
[49:02] had found out had done this type of care
[49:04] and made himself available
[49:07] now as a family discussed this we sat
[49:10] down in
[49:12] and we mentioned brother Jonathan to the
[49:14] rest of the family
[49:17] and they said that'll be perfect because
[49:18] he's going to be a Christian in the
[49:20] house
[49:21] we don't have to worry about who they
[49:23] would send
[49:25] and what they might want and what they
[49:27] might be but here's going to be a
[49:28] Christian in the house so
[49:31] if there was one issue and I was going
[49:33] to say this in front of him so hopefully
[49:35] he's hearing he was doing too much
[49:39] he wanted my mom to sit down and he'd
[49:42] clean the house
[49:43] we had to tell him no no no no you take
[49:46] care of that
[49:47] mom does those things but that's what
[49:49] keeps her busy that's what keeps her
[49:51] active she knows where
[49:53] she walks with her hand touching the
[49:55] walls she knows where everything's at
[49:56] she washes the dishes she sweeps the
[49:58] floors she washes the clothes
[50:01] sometimes it's all black she says
[50:04] sometimes it's all white
[50:06] but she can't see anything she doesn't
[50:07] know what it's going to be
[50:09] but she said tell the brother please I
[50:12] can handle this
[50:13] but brother Jonathan just wanted to do
[50:15] that with all his heart so
[50:17] really appreciate it he's been the
[50:19] family that's been blessed with that
[50:21] and we're going to use him dad wanted to
[50:24] be in church today we told him please
[50:26] take a little bit more time we
[50:28] me and my wife spend the day with him
[50:30] helping him yesterday but he's getting
[50:32] up out of the chair on his own going to
[50:34] the bathroom on his own getting in and
[50:35] out of bed on his own now
[50:38] and and holding his head up like this
[50:41] when he sits
[50:42] so it's just it's encouraging to him I
[50:46] know that it's he called me the other
[50:47] day he said I was ready to get up the
[50:49] chair and I'll just tell you something
[50:52] helped me just get up
[50:54] she said I know the Lord is watching
[50:55] over me so it's it's good to know the
[50:59] Lord today so
[51:01] appreciate that so we told brother
[51:03] Jonathan two weeks
[51:05] you know and he committed to that we may
[51:07] if it needs more we do more but so he
[51:11] asked Dad is are you getting along fine
[51:13] with brother Jonathan can you understand
[51:15] him he says until he gets excited
[51:18] and I said we've heard him preach that
[51:19] way yeah and I told brother Jonathan
[51:22] when you get excited we have a hard time
[51:23] understanding you
[51:25] but um I said and in your exercises that
[51:29] you're supposed to do oh he makes sure I
[51:31] do them
[51:32] brother Larry we're going to do the
[51:34] exercises now so
[51:35] it's been good the Lord's been good to
[51:38] us so
[51:39] and I know Sarah gave her testimony we
[51:42] sat through the meeting
[51:44] when they shared all this with us
[51:46] but that's the day the lord gave me that
[51:48] song the battle is the Lord's
[51:50] it is the Lord's
[51:53] and sometimes we just have to say yes
[51:56] Lord take our hands off of it
[51:58] and brother Joe
[52:01] happy birthday
[52:03] hi yeah
[52:07] on the dashboard of my truck I still
[52:09] have that little blue
[52:12] thing with the
[52:13] that you gave us to each one of us at
[52:15] the memorial
[52:17] and I remember there at the park
[52:19] when they dedicated the park
[52:22] after your wife's name and we prayed
[52:24] with the people there
[52:26] God has a reason and a purpose for all
[52:28] those things
[52:29] song says we'll understand it all by and
[52:32] by
[52:32] in the meantime like you said Lord
[52:34] increase our faith to believe that so
[52:38] you know as as
[52:41] spoke with brother Daniel
[52:43] about ministering and
[52:45] I'll kind of give a little bit of
[52:47] background here
[52:49] when he spoke this man Alex
[52:51] that he had met out and the man was
[52:54] in serious problems with drugs and all
[52:57] and he spoke to brother Daniel and you
[52:59] know brother Daniel shared it with us
[53:02] and then the next week he comes out and
[53:04] he sees the three men over there
[53:06] and he approaches them
[53:08] and one of them was Alex reading the
[53:10] Bible to the other two
[53:12] now brother Daniel was honest he said
[53:15] really
[53:18] in his heart he said and God couldn't
[53:20] have done that so quick
[53:23] but yes God works that way
[53:26] so on on Monday I was driving one one
[53:28] job site to the other and just began to
[53:30] think of that with brother Daniel had
[53:32] said
[53:33] and the Lord began to speak to me and he
[53:35] said you know
[53:37] I have less problem with those type of
[53:39] people
[53:40] than those who are religious and don't
[53:42] think they need help
[53:45] and you know I'm fine I'm good as is
[53:49] you know
[53:50] and he began to take me to some
[53:51] scriptures and just
[53:53] speak to me about it
[53:55] so when I spoke to brother Daniel about
[53:57] ministering
[53:59] and he just asked him how would he want
[54:01] to do this he says when you feel like
[54:03] you have something in your heart just
[54:04] let me know
[54:05] and we'll do that
[54:07] he says I'll never tell you what to
[54:09] preach on
[54:10] but could you just preach on what you
[54:11] told me
[54:14] so he broke his promise right off the
[54:15] bat no
[54:17] but no it was something already in my
[54:19] heart
[54:20] and I felt show of course this morning
[54:23] brother Daniel's preaching and you're is
[54:25] this going to tie together is this going
[54:27] to go together is this you know
[54:29] and and he ran and he went to the part
[54:31] where he began to speak and he said he
[54:33] doesn't even know them
[54:36] they've done all these things but he
[54:38] says I don't even know you
[54:41] because we've never had that Fellowship
[54:43] you know
[54:45] so this morning when he woke up and I
[54:48] I looked at scripture of the day and it
[54:49] was in Psalms 113 and it's just seven
[54:52] verses
[54:53] so I read psalms through
[54:56] 113 and then I read through psalms 114
[54:59] and I just went right on to 115 and
[55:03] began to read it
[55:05] in verses one through nine I'm reading
[55:07] through them and and just reading
[55:09] through them
[55:10] but I had forgotten that about verses 9
[55:13] and through 13.
[55:16] and I've read and I was halfway realized
[55:19] these are the this is a Psalm you gave
[55:21] me when I asked you do you know who I am
[55:24] and he took me right to Psalms 115
[55:27] verses 19. oh House of Aaron I have
[55:30] blessed thee and I have kept thee
[55:32] so when he began to ask him there
[55:36] does he know you
[55:38] I said Lord this morning you reminded
[55:40] you know who I am and I Know Who You Are
[55:43] so I said Lord you're in charge of all
[55:46] of this
[55:47] and and we trust in you so
[55:51] I would title this message
[55:54] he looked beyond my faults
[55:57] and he saw my need
[55:59] and if I could have maybe
[56:02] um
[56:03] what would I say uh
[56:05] a subtitle he said I must needs go to
[56:11] Samaria
[56:13] and you'll see that in the scripture so
[56:16] well while we're seated let's just bow
[56:17] our heads for a moment
[56:21] Lord as as humans in in his
[56:25] people with a finite mind
[56:29] we can see so much and so far Lord but
[56:32] you've already seen it all
[56:36] back from before the foundation of the
[56:39] world Lord which we can't understand
[56:41] that
[56:43] you give us glimpses and sometimes just
[56:45] a a touch and we know you're real
[56:48] you come by and you minister to us you
[56:50] talk with us Lord
[56:52] you fellowship with us Lord
[56:55] but Lord it was something that was in
[56:57] your heart a desire in your heart
[56:59] because it was it was that that was
[57:02] within you Lord
[57:04] and today it's being expressed this day
[57:06] right here at Tucson Tabernacle this
[57:09] evening how much you care for us
[57:12] that's your desire for us Lord
[57:15] and all you ask for us is just to
[57:17] surrender and yield to it and accept
[57:19] what you want to give to us to do for us
[57:22] the fellowship Lord the the
[57:25] conversations the times together
[57:28] how much it pleases you Lord so
[57:31] this evening Lord as as we Minister your
[57:34] word and things you've laid in our
[57:35] hearts Lord would would you just help us
[57:37] to see how much you care for us Lord
[57:40] how much we mean to you
[57:43] Even in our our state that we are at
[57:46] Even in our fallen State Even in our
[57:48] hard State even in the times that Lord
[57:50] we've done opposite of what you would
[57:52] desire you still look beyond our faults
[57:54] and you saw our need Lord
[57:57] and you met it so we just want to say
[57:58] thank you Lord
[58:00] because we appreciate it very much
[58:02] in Jesus Christ's name
[58:04] amen
[58:08] brother Daniel had asked I'd also said
[58:10] he said if you'd like to take one of the
[58:12] chapters of Acts that would be okay and
[58:14] I said no
[58:15] I think I'll leave that to you and
[58:16] brother Lyle because I think you do a
[58:18] much better job of teaching than I do
[58:20] so there is a portion out of the book of
[58:23] Acts but I'm jumping way ahead so
[58:26] um but we'll start with uh Luke 7 verse
[58:29] 28. there's a lot of scriptures
[58:32] we'll go through them
[58:36] and he says for I say unto you
[58:38] among those that are born of a woman
[58:40] there is not a greater Prophet than John
[58:43] the Baptist
[58:45] then he says but he that is the least in
[58:47] the kingdom of God is greater than he
[58:53] so sometimes if we're not careful we'll
[58:55] put somebody else
[58:56] before us higher than us bigger than us
[58:59] more important than us
[59:01] and John had that place to introduce the
[59:04] Messiah
[59:06] but God says I'm looking at that each
[59:09] one of you are as valuable to me as John
[59:12] was
[59:14] and I gave my life for each one of you
[59:17] so sometimes we look at it and and we're
[59:19] not careful or we do it we put this as
[59:21] bigger and this is less
[59:24] but for God it was all the same
[59:27] and remember the thought here that he
[59:30] shared with me that he spoke to me and
[59:32] he said I have less problem with these
[59:34] who are in a lot of problems than those
[59:37] who think they don't need help
[59:40] religious people
[59:43] Matthew 26 6-13
[59:47] just kind of laying a little bit of
[59:49] background here
[59:52] 26 6-13
[59:56] he said now when Jesus was in Bethany in
[59:59] the house of Simon the leper
[1:00:02] there came unto him a woman having an
[1:00:04] alabaster box a very precious ointment
[1:00:06] and parted on his head as he sat at meat
[1:00:10] but when his disciples saw it
[1:00:13] those who are around him those who knew
[1:00:17] him well they had indignation saying to
[1:00:20] to what purpose is this waste it doesn't
[1:00:23] say
[1:00:24] when that one specific disciple said
[1:00:27] when the disciples sought
[1:00:29] for this ointment might have been sold
[1:00:31] for much and given to the poor
[1:00:34] when Jesus understood it he said unto
[1:00:37] them why trouble ye the woman
[1:00:40] for she has wrought a good work upon me
[1:00:45] for ye have the poor always with you but
[1:00:47] me you have not always
[1:00:51] for in that she have poured this
[1:00:52] ointment on my body and she did that for
[1:00:55] my burial
[1:00:57] he was about to go through the greatest
[1:00:59] benefit we would ever have in life
[1:01:03] and they're saying why did she waste
[1:01:06] that
[1:01:07] verily I say unto you whosoever this
[1:01:10] gospel wheresoever this gospel shall be
[1:01:13] preached in the whole world there shall
[1:01:15] also this that the woman hath done be
[1:01:18] told for a memorial of her
[1:01:22] and the disciples were complaining
[1:01:28] I just said to myself Lord help us
[1:01:31] sometimes we don't understand it but
[1:01:33] don't let us look at it wrong
[1:01:35] saying Lord I don't understand it but
[1:01:37] you're in charge of this you're in
[1:01:39] control of yourself
[1:01:41] yesterday evening we had some of the
[1:01:44] older young folks
[1:01:46] because my girls are all in their 30s
[1:01:47] and olders now so it's my turn to preach
[1:01:50] about
[1:01:51] brother Daniel gets it when he preaches
[1:01:54] that's why it turned out and so they
[1:01:57] were over in
[1:01:58] I uh waited till they were all sitted at
[1:02:01] the table and I said I just want to let
[1:02:03] you know
[1:02:04] oh everything that is said and done here
[1:02:08] be careful because it might be spoken at
[1:02:11] church tomorrow
[1:02:13] they behave themselves very well
[1:02:17] they were we we have a good group of
[1:02:20] young people here
[1:02:21] I love the Lord Jesus first of all okay
[1:02:24] it's just it's just good to see that and
[1:02:27] be there so we we were blessing it had
[1:02:29] been a long time since we had had
[1:02:32] uh something like that at the house was
[1:02:34] we had been doing a lot of remodeling
[1:02:36] work and stuff like that and Mama
[1:02:37] finally felt like
[1:02:39] it'll be okay now I'm happy with it and
[1:02:42] she said it sure was nice to have them
[1:02:44] over and and they were very um
[1:02:48] very good about leaving early enough
[1:02:52] we didn't have to chase at home at one
[1:02:53] o'clock in the morning so
[1:02:56] but we enjoyed them very much so I
[1:02:58] appreciate that so
[1:03:01] so again just just the thought here is
[1:03:04] is those that
[1:03:06] that God was ministering to if you look
[1:03:10] at it through the book The First the
[1:03:12] four gospels how he reached to those who
[1:03:15] were looked down on
[1:03:17] how we're considered they were
[1:03:19] considered less
[1:03:21] not worthy of the Gospel not worthy of
[1:03:24] this
[1:03:25] people like Peter
[1:03:27] who look at some of these that Jesus
[1:03:29] called as his disciples they were not
[1:03:31] those that we would have said oh they're
[1:03:33] not learned they're not studied they
[1:03:35] don't know the message they don't know
[1:03:36] this but God said no they're the ones I
[1:03:39] will choose
[1:03:40] and I will meet with them
[1:03:43] no
[1:03:44] the first quote that I want to read
[1:03:46] numbers have two quotes and I want to
[1:03:47] read this one first
[1:03:49] out of the message shalom
[1:03:53] and I believe I gave it to them so
[1:03:58] he says like Paul said Hallelujah he had
[1:04:01] an infirmity something that was
[1:04:03] bothering him the devil would Buffet him
[1:04:05] blow after blow and he consulted the
[1:04:08] Lord three times to take it away from
[1:04:10] him he said I don't want this Lord take
[1:04:13] it away from me now when I read that I
[1:04:16] think I could hear Paul saying Lord look
[1:04:18] I'm I'm your servant I'm doing what you
[1:04:21] want me to do you've called me to be
[1:04:23] here but this is bothering me and if you
[1:04:25] would take it away from me I would be
[1:04:27] much more effective
[1:04:29] I could do a better job I think I could
[1:04:31] handle this better I think we start
[1:04:34] telling God how we can handle his
[1:04:36] program
[1:04:38] and sometimes I can't even take care of
[1:04:40] myself you know but here we are so and
[1:04:44] then one night the Lord spoke to him and
[1:04:46] said Paul my grace is sufficient
[1:04:50] more than enough
[1:04:53] do you realize that this favor that I
[1:04:56] place on you and I do for you is nothing
[1:04:58] you've deserved it's Grace
[1:05:01] think it was brother green that used the
[1:05:03] term unmerited favor
[1:05:05] nothing that I did to Merit it
[1:05:09] I I type that in as a relationship
[1:05:12] between a husband and a wife
[1:05:15] the the the the bond of there is love
[1:05:19] okay
[1:05:21] but when I do this because I think if I
[1:05:24] don't do this for her she'll be mad at
[1:05:26] me
[1:05:28] or if she's saying then what kind of
[1:05:30] relationship is that
[1:05:32] but if I do it for her because I love
[1:05:34] her
[1:05:36] and she does it because now that's the
[1:05:38] type of relationship you want to live
[1:05:39] with you want to be in
[1:05:41] and that's the relationship we have with
[1:05:43] God we know that he first loved us
[1:05:46] we know that we're part of him we know
[1:05:49] that he went to Calvary for us and there
[1:05:52] even though he said is there another way
[1:05:54] to do this he let his will go and said
[1:05:56] not my will but thy will be done
[1:05:59] because he desired that Fellowship
[1:06:02] he loved me before I knew him
[1:06:06] before I even even had had any
[1:06:09] fellowship with him or even I knew he
[1:06:11] loved me already
[1:06:13] and he says I'm going to take care of
[1:06:16] this situation that has broken the
[1:06:19] fellowship
[1:06:20] and he's going to do that so here it is
[1:06:23] he says my grace I know you don't Merit
[1:06:25] it Paul it's nothing you did for it but
[1:06:27] I'm giving it to you
[1:06:30] so then Paul realized and he said then
[1:06:32] all glory in my infirmity all glory in
[1:06:36] it I know you're the Healer I've seen
[1:06:38] you heal the sick raise the dead and
[1:06:41] cast out Devils Open the Eyes of the
[1:06:43] blind but I've consulted you and you
[1:06:46] tell me your grace is sufficient
[1:06:49] then this devil that bothers me is The
[1:06:52] Growing Pains of your grace
[1:06:56] oh
[1:06:57] so that's why some of the problems that
[1:06:59] I go through so that I can experience
[1:07:02] his grace and his love even more
[1:07:06] when I don't deserve it
[1:07:09] because a lot of times Lord I've done
[1:07:11] some good things for you I deserve your
[1:07:13] grace now that's not Grace
[1:07:16] that's works
[1:07:18] Lord I'm a failure but yet your mercy
[1:07:20] still reaches out to me and you still
[1:07:22] love me let that Grace work in his life
[1:07:25] he says it's a Growing Pains of your
[1:07:27] grace then I'll glory in my infirmities
[1:07:29] because it lets God be manifested
[1:07:32] why if lest I get exalted above the
[1:07:36] abundance of the revelation
[1:07:39] you see Paul was given all of this
[1:07:43] so it could be written for us
[1:07:46] opened up
[1:07:48] and he could stand there and say I have
[1:07:51] more Revelation than any of you
[1:07:53] God has given to me I went three and a
[1:07:56] half years in Arabia and didn't consult
[1:07:58] with a single person but I met with God
[1:08:00] personally
[1:08:02] but he could have puffed himself up
[1:08:06] you know if you if you look through Paul
[1:08:08] through Paul's writings he's always
[1:08:09] talking and he says if and he comes in
[1:08:12] he says if if you want to compare uh uh
[1:08:15] genealogy if you want to compare lineage
[1:08:17] if you want to compare experiences I'll
[1:08:19] compare him with you
[1:08:21] I'm I was born this way I came through
[1:08:23] this I did this has happened I this I've
[1:08:25] met him she says but I count it as
[1:08:27] nothing
[1:08:30] that's the first day he's a messenger
[1:08:32] the seventh angel messenger had no
[1:08:35] education
[1:08:36] very little schooling and you hear him
[1:08:38] Lament The fact
[1:08:40] if I would have had a little more
[1:08:41] education if I would have been I could
[1:08:43] have understood I could have but God can
[1:08:45] use both
[1:08:48] he's going through the the Oral Roberts
[1:08:52] University I believe and he's walking
[1:08:54] through and he's expressing his thoughts
[1:08:56] saying Lord obviously you didn't have
[1:08:59] enough confidence in me
[1:09:01] to be able to handle the monies the
[1:09:03] things and so forth and that's he's
[1:09:05] talking to himself to God
[1:09:07] he's looking down at himself
[1:09:11] and it was not until he got out of that
[1:09:14] atmosphere
[1:09:16] he stepped outside of that
[1:09:19] that voice said I am your portion
[1:09:25] we got to get out of some of the
[1:09:27] atmospheres that we create ourselves
[1:09:29] that we put into ourselves that we find
[1:09:32] ourselves in
[1:09:33] and um
[1:09:35] they're no fun sometimes well most of
[1:09:38] the time if not all the time
[1:09:39] if it's those type of atmospheres it's
[1:09:42] the last couple of months of work and
[1:09:43] it's been the last couple years of work
[1:09:45] has been hard it's been frustrating
[1:09:47] because
[1:09:48] so much as of it is out of our control
[1:09:50] and everything
[1:09:52] to the point it's made it difficult for
[1:09:54] me and I told my wife the other day and
[1:09:56] I apologize to her I'm sorry I've been a
[1:09:58] little difficult to be around because of
[1:10:00] all this pressure all this going I want
[1:10:03] to be able to do something about it and
[1:10:05] sometimes I can't
[1:10:07] and I have to learn to understand that I
[1:10:09] can't
[1:10:11] um it's out of my control
[1:10:13] and and so I had to apologize I said
[1:10:15] I've been a little hard to deal with
[1:10:17] lately just as I'm frustrated I'm upset
[1:10:21] um and when you get that way you snap
[1:10:22] real easy or you say things you should
[1:10:24] to say and and you don't mean it you
[1:10:27] just you know
[1:10:28] but when you can let go and let God
[1:10:32] and sometimes I'm driving along going
[1:10:34] from one job to another
[1:10:36] like I said the other day that man
[1:10:38] hitting uh you know curse at me I just
[1:10:42] happened to be the employee of our
[1:10:43] company and he let go at me
[1:10:45] because he's frustrated because we
[1:10:47] haven't been able to resolve his issues
[1:10:50] and and this is what happened I I went
[1:10:53] in and
[1:10:54] I wish I could say I rejoice in the Lord
[1:10:57] that I had been a Christian and it
[1:10:59] didn't really go that way
[1:11:01] I walked in and the painter was working
[1:11:02] there and I began to tell him about what
[1:11:04] just happened outside
[1:11:06] and then I told the other guy about what
[1:11:08] happened inside and then it was later
[1:11:10] and I said but I never talked to God
[1:11:12] about it
[1:11:14] because see those guys agreed with me
[1:11:17] yeah it's been terrible yeah it's been
[1:11:19] real bad yeah it's been
[1:11:21] maybe God would have spoke a little
[1:11:22] different
[1:11:24] he would have said it's okay
[1:11:26] all right just be a Christian
[1:11:28] these are this is my grace
[1:11:31] this is how you learn your lessons this
[1:11:34] is how you grow
[1:11:36] you know and it was until later I said
[1:11:38] I'm sorry Lord I should have talked to
[1:11:39] you about it rather than spread my woes
[1:11:42] with everybody else
[1:11:44] and we get that way so Paul here is
[1:11:46] saying you know God keeps us humble God
[1:11:49] keeps us
[1:11:51] yet he gives us eternal life
[1:11:54] so looking at this here he was this
[1:11:57] parable of this this woman
[1:11:59] and now we'll take some examples of
[1:12:02] those who we were not given an
[1:12:04] opportunity
[1:12:05] to be a Christian
[1:12:07] Luke 19.
[1:12:10] verses 5 through 10 and and there's so
[1:12:13] many examples and especially in the the
[1:12:15] four Gospels
[1:12:16] of people who God Jesus went out out of
[1:12:20] his way to go meet with him
[1:12:24] Luke 19 verses 5 through 10.
[1:12:28] and I'm going to just do portions of the
[1:12:31] thing because some of these would be 25
[1:12:33] or 30 scriptures long but
[1:12:36] now Zacchaeus we know had gotten up in
[1:12:37] the tree because he wanted he was a
[1:12:39] little man and he wanted to see Jesus
[1:12:41] and when Jesus came to the place he
[1:12:44] looked up and saw him
[1:12:46] and I don't think he was surprised the
[1:12:48] Zacchaeus Was up there I think he
[1:12:50] already knew
[1:12:52] and he said unto him Zacchaeus make
[1:12:54] haste and come down for today I must
[1:12:57] abide at thy house
[1:13:00] so he's already knowing where he was
[1:13:02] going
[1:13:03] I'm going over to Zacchaeus place today
[1:13:05] he doesn't know it he's climbing up the
[1:13:07] tree but I'm fully aware of it and he
[1:13:10] made haste and he came down and received
[1:13:12] him joyfully
[1:13:14] and when they saw it they all murmured
[1:13:17] saying that was gone that he was gone to
[1:13:20] be the guest with a man that is a sinner
[1:13:26] I'm glad that he's not afraid to be the
[1:13:28] guest of someone who's a sinner
[1:13:31] because that's where me and you were at
[1:13:32] one time and he was willing to walk down
[1:13:34] our street and said hey knock on my door
[1:13:38] and I said yes who is it
[1:13:40] is that I am the Lord Jesus and I'm here
[1:13:43] for you
[1:13:44] and Zacchaeus stood and said unto the
[1:13:47] Lord be whole Lord the half of my goods
[1:13:50] I give to the poor and if I have taken
[1:13:52] anything from any man by false
[1:13:55] accusation I restore him fourfold so now
[1:13:58] here he is confessing what he did
[1:14:03] when you get before the Lord and he
[1:14:05] comes and he deals you with your heart
[1:14:06] in that way you have but nothing but to
[1:14:09] say I'm you're right Lord I'm wrong
[1:14:12] it's not a time for excuses it's a time
[1:14:16] to make things right because it's God
[1:14:18] expressing his love to you
[1:14:22] and perfect love cast away all fear
[1:14:27] he's not going to condemn me he's not
[1:14:30] going to strike me dead when I tell him
[1:14:32] I'm wrong in all the wrongs I did
[1:14:34] he's going to love me
[1:14:37] and Jesus said unto him this day is
[1:14:40] salvation to come to this house
[1:14:42] for as much as he
[1:14:44] also is a son of Abraham Zacchaeus
[1:14:49] didn't know it till then
[1:14:51] that he was a son of Abraham
[1:14:55] if you looked at his deeds neither did
[1:14:57] we
[1:14:59] but when he met God God came down that
[1:15:02] way because Zacchaeus Was up in the tree
[1:15:06] how many know God has met you that way
[1:15:08] in your situation hey I was in a place
[1:15:12] and God came down my way
[1:15:18] and he said verse 10
[1:15:20] for the son of man has come to seek and
[1:15:23] to say that which was lost
[1:15:27] so if it was lost at one time it was not
[1:15:30] lost
[1:15:32] the way it's worded at one time it was
[1:15:35] not lost brother Branham says at one
[1:15:37] time you were in the back of his mind of
[1:15:40] thought you were going to be expressed
[1:15:43] at a certain time
[1:15:45] and God chose this time for each one of
[1:15:47] you
[1:15:50] Mark 5 15-20
[1:15:56] I'm sorry I've got the wrong scripture I
[1:15:58] jumped ahead let's go to
[1:16:01] Luke 18. 9 through 14.
[1:16:08] and he spake the this Parable unto
[1:16:11] certain which trusted in themselves that
[1:16:14] they were righteous and despised others
[1:16:19] he said there are those who are
[1:16:20] righteous in themselves and they look
[1:16:22] down on others
[1:16:25] and and that's happened to all of us I'm
[1:16:27] sure
[1:16:28] somebody who has said this or that about
[1:16:31] you or you don't believe this like I
[1:16:33] believe it or you don't see it this way
[1:16:35] the way I see it therefore you're not
[1:16:38] you know
[1:16:40] I I've shared this experience with you
[1:16:42] and something brother Dan said this
[1:16:44] morning reminded me of it
[1:16:46] when he was talking about this one who
[1:16:48] who was
[1:16:50] and he is the word denominations
[1:16:53] within the message
[1:16:56] and they're there they are there
[1:16:59] and and this brother come up to me and I
[1:17:01] was with another brother and he said I
[1:17:03] got a question for you and I said yeah
[1:17:05] go ahead you know ask
[1:17:07] and he said would you do what brother
[1:17:09] Branham said or would you do what
[1:17:10] brother Branham did
[1:17:13] and I don't think you can answer a
[1:17:15] question with just that much information
[1:17:16] what is this leading to
[1:17:19] so I said explain yourself what do you
[1:17:21] mean
[1:17:22] and he said well brother Branham said
[1:17:24] you shouldn't have a a Christmas tree
[1:17:26] but he had one
[1:17:29] so which would you do
[1:17:32] and again it's just the Lord that gives
[1:17:34] you the answer he said and I looked at
[1:17:36] him I said brother I just draw a bigger
[1:17:38] Circle
[1:17:40] that was my answer to him
[1:17:42] and he goes what I said I would draw a
[1:17:45] bigger Circle and cover those that don't
[1:17:47] see it the way it'll come right back in
[1:17:50] and you look at me said Thank you and he
[1:17:52] walked away
[1:17:54] the other brother looked at me and he
[1:17:55] said where did that answer come from I
[1:17:57] said from him because I had no plans for
[1:17:59] this
[1:17:59] I didn't say I'm going to meet this man
[1:18:01] he's going to ask me this question and
[1:18:03] I'm going to no we were just walking
[1:18:04] down the hallway and the brother comes
[1:18:06] up but God gives the answers
[1:18:09] draw a bigger Circle you're my brother
[1:18:11] you're my sister
[1:18:15] so it says
[1:18:18] they trusted in themselves righteous and
[1:18:21] despise other he said two men went up to
[1:18:24] the temple to pray one a Pharisee and
[1:18:27] the other Republican
[1:18:29] the Pharisees stood and prayed thus with
[1:18:31] himself God I thank thee that I am not
[1:18:34] as other men are extortioners unjust
[1:18:37] adulterers or even as this publican
[1:18:42] I fast twice in the week I give tithe of
[1:18:45] all that I possess
[1:18:47] and the public can stand in afar off
[1:18:50] were not even
[1:18:51] lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven
[1:18:55] but smote upon his own breath saying God
[1:18:57] be merciful to me a sinner
[1:19:00] I tell you this man went down to his
[1:19:03] house Justified rather than the other
[1:19:05] for everyone that exalters himself shall
[1:19:09] be abased and he that humble themselves
[1:19:11] shall be exalted
[1:19:14] God said it's easier to deal with
[1:19:16] somebody like that who will come and say
[1:19:18] hey I need your help
[1:19:20] I'm willing to take your help
[1:19:27] now
[1:19:30] let's go to we did Mark
[1:19:33] I guess if I follow the sheet by number
[1:19:35] it'd be a little easier
[1:19:38] what's that
[1:19:40] yes I did I just not reading to the
[1:19:42] bottom
[1:19:43] yeah
[1:19:45] you know it's it's kind of funny if you
[1:19:47] follow directions things work pretty
[1:19:48] good
[1:19:50] you ever build a model and then skip
[1:19:51] part of the directions and wonder how
[1:19:53] you ended up with what you ended up with
[1:19:55] yeah I did a lot of that
[1:19:58] it was supposed to be an airplane but
[1:19:59] looked more like it had crashed already
[1:20:03] you know
[1:20:06] sometimes I think we do that in our own
[1:20:08] lives
[1:20:10] you know God I can finish this project
[1:20:11] you're working on I think I've got it
[1:20:13] all figured out I think I've got it
[1:20:15] resolved and I prayed all last night and
[1:20:17] Lord and I did I read a whole chapter
[1:20:19] this day and I did this I did my good
[1:20:21] deed already so Lord I'm ready
[1:20:23] God says go
[1:20:25] and then when you fall flat on your face
[1:20:29] we'll work on this again you know
[1:20:32] so
[1:20:36] let's go to John chapter 4 and I'm going
[1:20:40] to jump through some of this verses
[1:20:41] because we pretty well know the stories
[1:20:43] we've read the scriptures you know John
[1:20:45] chapter 4 verse 4.
[1:20:50] and he must need to go through Samaria
[1:20:55] he's with his disciples and he's headed
[1:20:57] in and some he knew he had to go this
[1:21:01] certain route
[1:21:04] and of course now we jump to verse 7 and
[1:21:06] he says and we know he's going down that
[1:21:08] way and there cometh a woman of Samaria
[1:21:10] to draw water and Jesus saith unto her
[1:21:13] give me to drink
[1:21:15] now
[1:21:17] I don't know I've always said he told
[1:21:19] you know we know he told his disciples
[1:21:20] to go get some meat to go to town
[1:21:23] because I don't think the disciples
[1:21:24] would have understood
[1:21:26] why are you dealing with this woman do
[1:21:28] you know why she's here why the she has
[1:21:31] to be here at this time
[1:21:34] yes he did know why
[1:21:36] he said I must need to go that way
[1:21:39] there's someone over there that needs me
[1:21:41] you know
[1:21:43] ah
[1:21:44] so that you know in verse 7 he says give
[1:21:47] he tells her to give me a drink he
[1:21:49] discusses with her
[1:21:51] and tells her about the water that he
[1:21:54] gives
[1:21:56] verse 15 the woman saith unto him sir
[1:21:59] give me this water that I thirst not
[1:22:02] neither come hither to draw she's still
[1:22:04] thinking in the natural
[1:22:06] I'm not sure how you're going to do it
[1:22:08] but we have to draw we have to put the
[1:22:10] pail down we have to bring it back up
[1:22:12] too
[1:22:13] but you're telling me about something
[1:22:14] that doesn't that works differently than
[1:22:16] this
[1:22:18] Jesus said now
[1:22:21] under here you go go call thy husband
[1:22:22] and then and come hither
[1:22:25] the woman answers that I have no husband
[1:22:27] Jesus said unto her thou has well said I
[1:22:30] have no husband
[1:22:32] for thou Hast five husbands and he whom
[1:22:34] thou now has is not thy husband
[1:22:38] in that thou said is truly
[1:22:43] could you imagine being told something
[1:22:44] straight out like that whether you're
[1:22:47] walking through the line with a prophet
[1:22:49] the Lord Jesus Christ somebody using
[1:22:51] somebody and they just
[1:22:54] you have two two reactions to that
[1:22:59] you try to hide it you try to cover it
[1:23:01] you try to make an excuse for it or you
[1:23:03] realize only God knows that
[1:23:08] and if only God knows that and he's
[1:23:10] unveiling it
[1:23:13] why don't you say Lord obviously you
[1:23:16] care
[1:23:17] you know
[1:23:20] you're not doing this to embarrassing me
[1:23:22] you're not doing this to shame me you're
[1:23:24] doing this to help me
[1:23:26] when God comes down your way and he
[1:23:29] begins to unveil something begins to
[1:23:31] show you something in your heart say yes
[1:23:33] Lord you're being mindful of me right
[1:23:35] now
[1:23:36] he says so she says
[1:23:39] the woman saith him sir I perceive that
[1:23:42] thou art a prophet she had enough
[1:23:45] teaching enough knowing that this is
[1:23:47] something a prophet of God would do
[1:23:52] you know and I don't know what
[1:23:53] experiences you've had in your life but
[1:23:55] I've had some of those in my life
[1:23:58] and I think I've shared them with you
[1:24:00] when brother Steve Shelley came this way
[1:24:02] the first time
[1:24:04] and he was here ministering
[1:24:06] I came up in the prayer line
[1:24:09] he was somewhere about I think he was
[1:24:12] right about here and we came walking
[1:24:13] right up about there and I was just
[1:24:14] about to where that speaker is
[1:24:17] and I'd had some problems with my ankle
[1:24:19] but my heart was for two people
[1:24:21] who I wanted God to deal with their
[1:24:23] hearts
[1:24:24] and as he's come up right about there he
[1:24:27] said now brother you're here for two
[1:24:29] people who are in your heart he said
[1:24:31] those words right to me and I know
[1:24:34] that's exactly why I was coming up
[1:24:37] and I just jumped straight up
[1:24:40] I I just with the reaction God knows
[1:24:44] and he's going to meet it
[1:24:46] God's going to do it his way
[1:24:49] she recognized hey this has got to be
[1:24:52] God this has got to be a prophet
[1:24:55] brother Shelley came walking down the
[1:24:56] middle aisle at the end of service
[1:25:00] and there was a family sitting towards
[1:25:02] the very back and I was in the back seat
[1:25:04] like where brother Lyle is there
[1:25:07] and he's speaking in tongues
[1:25:10] and when he gets about to wear this
[1:25:11] family he turns and he's speaking in
[1:25:13] tongues pointing at them
[1:25:15] the whole family was sitting there
[1:25:18] I'm not understanding the words I'm just
[1:25:21] listening
[1:25:23] but the sister he was talking to her
[1:25:25] daughter and husband that their
[1:25:27] son-in-law were sitting there they heard
[1:25:30] the whole thing in English
[1:25:33] the rest of us heard the tongues
[1:25:36] and what he told her was exactly what
[1:25:39] was going on in her life what had
[1:25:41] happened and how God didn't hold it
[1:25:43] against her
[1:25:46] God still moves
[1:25:49] God still works God still cares
[1:25:55] these things are true no he she Rick I
[1:25:57] perceive that thou art a prophet and you
[1:26:00] know and we'll jump to verse verse 25 he
[1:26:04] said the woman saith unto him I know
[1:26:06] that the Messiah cometh which is called
[1:26:08] Christ when he has come he was tell us
[1:26:11] these things
[1:26:12] Jesus saith unto her I that speak unto
[1:26:15] thee am he
[1:26:17] I am this promise that you're asking
[1:26:19] about and I'm doing it exactly and
[1:26:21] you've recognized it
[1:26:24] now watch this and this is this is kind
[1:26:27] of when we're here and upon this time
[1:26:29] right about this time came his disciples
[1:26:32] and Marvel that he talked to with that
[1:26:35] woman
[1:26:36] yet no man said what sickest thou or who
[1:26:39] I talk is outer but they're wondering
[1:26:40] why is he talking to her he knows that
[1:26:42] at this time she's a woman of ill Fame
[1:26:45] she's not a good woman that's why
[1:26:48] they're seeing that
[1:26:50] and you know
[1:26:52] but he had already said
[1:26:54] I got to go through some area
[1:26:59] When God Says something like that don't
[1:27:01] question him
[1:27:03] if you need to know he'll tell you
[1:27:06] but just say Lord you've proved yourself
[1:27:08] over and over and over I'm going to
[1:27:10] trust in you you've got this all under
[1:27:13] control
[1:27:14] now we know that that
[1:27:16] that she goes back to tell all those
[1:27:19] isn't this the very Messiah
[1:27:22] see if you jump all the way up to verse
[1:27:24] 32 9 and he said in many of the
[1:27:27] Samaritans of that City believed on him
[1:27:29] for the saying of the woman which
[1:27:31] testified he told me all that I ever did
[1:27:36] brother Joe if the Lord would come and
[1:27:38] he would take one thing out of your life
[1:27:41] and say Joe about this and this you
[1:27:43] would say the same thing
[1:27:45] he told me everything that I've ever did
[1:27:48] because you realize he knew it all
[1:27:52] but he never condemned her
[1:27:56] he never said because of this action I
[1:27:58] can't help you
[1:28:00] he just said I am he and I can give you
[1:28:04] this water
[1:28:06] but watch of this so many of the
[1:28:08] Samaritans believed on him
[1:28:11] so when the Samaritans were come unto
[1:28:13] him they besought him that he would
[1:28:15] tarry with them and he Abode their two
[1:28:17] days and many more believed because of
[1:28:20] his own word
[1:28:23] yet he could walk among the religious
[1:28:25] people and all they did was criticize
[1:28:27] him run him down and draw none of the
[1:28:30] benefits that they could have got from
[1:28:32] him
[1:28:35] we have to be very careful
[1:28:37] because it's easy for us to do the same
[1:28:40] thing
[1:28:42] Lord you know I've been a Christian for
[1:28:44] so long I've
[1:28:45] I can honestly say I've been a Christian
[1:28:47] in my whole life
[1:28:48] I was raised in a Christian home I've
[1:28:51] never known the world as other people
[1:28:52] have known but I need just as much
[1:28:55] salvation in fact
[1:28:57] these are the type of people God has a
[1:28:58] harder time with
[1:29:00] I been a good boy
[1:29:04] I never did this and I thank God that he
[1:29:07] kept me from all of that
[1:29:09] I have an older brother
[1:29:11] who got into some trouble and later in
[1:29:13] life he was telling me he said I still
[1:29:16] have those memories I still have some of
[1:29:18] those flashbacks of things I did that I
[1:29:20] wish I never did
[1:29:23] but you know
[1:29:26] I needed God as much as anybody else
[1:29:30] there had to come to a time in my life
[1:29:32] when I realized
[1:29:33] I'm a sinner
[1:29:35] without him I am nothing
[1:29:38] and the honest truth God has kept us
[1:29:41] is watched over us
[1:29:43] the only the only person that I ever
[1:29:46] kissed in my life is my wife
[1:29:50] the only time the first time I kissed
[1:29:51] her we were married
[1:29:53] okay
[1:29:55] but I still needed salvation
[1:29:57] I still needed God's mercy
[1:30:00] it never changes
[1:30:02] but you know it was People Like Us who
[1:30:05] walked around for a while saying I'm a
[1:30:06] good boy
[1:30:08] I'm better than those
[1:30:10] you know you look down on people if
[1:30:13] you're not careful
[1:30:16] but a god rich in Mercy
[1:30:19] said you're mine and I'll reach out to
[1:30:21] you
[1:30:24] I he has spoken to me
[1:30:27] in an audible voice four times in my
[1:30:29] life
[1:30:33] why he chose to do that I don't know
[1:30:36] but he did
[1:30:38] I was a young man about 17 years old
[1:30:42] sitting maybe a couple rows would be
[1:30:44] right behind Brother Andy
[1:30:46] in the December meetings
[1:30:49] maybe close to where sister Martha is or
[1:30:52] right in that area someplace
[1:30:54] and it was jam-packed there was
[1:30:57] six 700 people and those meetings maybe
[1:31:00] more
[1:31:01] we were packed in like sardines
[1:31:04] chairs down here literally like this
[1:31:08] and
[1:31:09] by where brother Joe is maybe one row
[1:31:12] back
[1:31:13] there was a brother there who was my
[1:31:15] pastor at the time
[1:31:17] another brother was preaching here
[1:31:21] and I would watch my pastor then
[1:31:24] and how he reacted I reacted
[1:31:28] if he said amen I said amen if he nodded
[1:31:31] his head I nodded my head if he didn't
[1:31:33] react I didn't react
[1:31:36] I was being very spiritual
[1:31:39] I thought so
[1:31:41] we laugh about some of those things we
[1:31:43] look back on him but at that time it was
[1:31:45] very serious
[1:31:46] we thought we were doing right
[1:31:49] and I was facing this way so on my left
[1:31:51] side
[1:31:52] a voice spoke to me from about right
[1:31:54] here just right behind me and said is
[1:31:57] that man your Holy Ghost
[1:32:00] I turned to look because there was a
[1:32:03] loud voice from behind me and I turned
[1:32:06] to look this way to see who it was there
[1:32:09] was nobody standing there and nobody
[1:32:11] else turned
[1:32:13] I would love to say I understood it then
[1:32:17] but it was a little later in life in our
[1:32:19] allies I had my eyes on a man
[1:32:22] and God was telling me
[1:32:24] I am your portion
[1:32:27] later on a little older already married
[1:32:30] and
[1:32:31] we had gone to visit another church
[1:32:34] and I was thinking possibly maybe we
[1:32:36] would go there
[1:32:38] I had spoke to brother green about it
[1:32:40] we shared some things
[1:32:43] I told him just telling you know I'm
[1:32:44] going I didn't tell him that I was
[1:32:45] possibly thinking of going but I was
[1:32:46] going to go visit
[1:32:48] but see God knew everything behind that
[1:32:51] you know
[1:32:53] we were sitting down in the church
[1:32:55] the song leader of that church knew me
[1:32:58] well
[1:32:59] and I have said in my heart please don't
[1:33:01] call me up don't don't recognize me I
[1:33:03] just want to sit here
[1:33:05] he never did
[1:33:07] and
[1:33:09] he was leading the song service and the
[1:33:11] minister comes out like we do stand here
[1:33:14] and that same voice again said now
[1:33:16] there's a man who's very high on himself
[1:33:20] loudly again I turned to see who's
[1:33:24] standing and talking to me
[1:33:26] I turn around and look to my wife and
[1:33:28] she's not reacting and I later asked her
[1:33:30] did you hear that voice he said I heard
[1:33:32] nothing
[1:33:34] about halfway through this ministering
[1:33:36] the brother began to exalt himself how
[1:33:39] he was as revelated he had as good a
[1:33:41] revelation as anybody in the message and
[1:33:43] began to lift himself up
[1:33:46] I don't hold it against the brother it
[1:33:48] was God telling me that's not your place
[1:33:52] that's not where you belong
[1:33:54] later at the Tabernacle here
[1:33:58] Tabernacle is going through some changes
[1:34:01] and there was some competition between
[1:34:02] some of the brothers who wanted the
[1:34:04] authority here
[1:34:08] and it got pretty political
[1:34:11] there was things that happened here it
[1:34:13] happened in the offices and it was it
[1:34:15] was a tough time
[1:34:17] and
[1:34:19] I chose at that time to back away from
[1:34:22] Ministry
[1:34:23] and not get involved in that
[1:34:25] but I was driving my work vehicle East
[1:34:28] on Valencia crossing over the railroad
[1:34:31] tracks by the airport
[1:34:34] just past Nogales Highway
[1:34:37] and I asked this question out loud
[1:34:40] because brother green used to call us
[1:34:42] the pastors
[1:34:44] the four of us Brothers we were the
[1:34:46] pastors
[1:34:47] and I just said to him I said Lord what
[1:34:50] does a pastor need to know understand
[1:34:54] and it was as if he was sitting on the
[1:34:56] passenger seat
[1:34:58] there and the voice rang out and said a
[1:35:01] pastor needs to understand the Sheep are
[1:35:03] mine they're not his
[1:35:06] it made the van go like this
[1:35:10] and it shook me
[1:35:12] but it's one of the best things that
[1:35:14] ever happened to me
[1:35:16] you are God's sheep
[1:35:19] you are God's redeemed
[1:35:21] you are in God's hands
[1:35:24] we have to surrender ourselves to be of
[1:35:27] service to you
[1:35:30] and if a pastor is not careful
[1:35:32] he begins to demand the attention the
[1:35:35] desire you're serving me but no you're
[1:35:38] God's people
[1:35:41] brother Ram says we're just here to
[1:35:44] serve
[1:35:47] the last time he spoke to me
[1:35:49] we were looking at a brother
[1:35:52] and you know
[1:35:56] it's easy to look upon a man
[1:35:59] a brother
[1:36:01] and as this was before I got to service
[1:36:04] and I was looking at a certain brother
[1:36:06] and all
[1:36:08] and the Lord spoke the same voice
[1:36:11] but he spoke it quietly in my ear and I
[1:36:13] recognized the voice because it's spoken
[1:36:15] to me four times now
[1:36:17] and he said he will be their Holy Ghost
[1:36:23] and I stopped and I said Lord you are in
[1:36:27] charge of all of this
[1:36:30] and I commit it to you
[1:36:34] God watches over his heritage
[1:36:39] no man is to be in charge no man is to
[1:36:42] be the Holy Ghost we are to surrender
[1:36:44] and yield
[1:36:47] when a man and I'm saying this by
[1:36:49] personal experience now
[1:36:51] and I'm not speaking of him
[1:36:53] speaking of myself
[1:36:56] when I want to be in charge when I want
[1:36:58] it to go my way then God can't have his
[1:37:02] way
[1:37:04] but brother Branham says in brother
[1:37:07] Daniel reminded me when he said it no it
[1:37:10] was my father talking to me today I
[1:37:12] believe he said when he said remember
[1:37:14] brother brannins or maybe it was you
[1:37:16] maybe both of you
[1:37:19] got a short memory
[1:37:21] um I think I don't remember
[1:37:24] but
[1:37:25] he said the greatest gift a person can
[1:37:28] have is getting themselves out of the
[1:37:31] way
[1:37:32] and letting God Speak
[1:37:35] it's not the easiest thing to do
[1:37:37] because you're human
[1:37:38] it's a battle
[1:37:41] but look what God Said
[1:37:43] look to who he went to to people who
[1:37:46] realized they had no good to offer
[1:37:51] there wasn't nothing they could say Lord
[1:37:53] look at my righteous Deeds
[1:37:56] they had nothing there's Zacchaeus in
[1:37:58] life Legion
[1:38:01] what you know look at this man Legion
[1:38:05] at the end after his change he wants to
[1:38:08] follow he says I want to go with you
[1:38:09] Jesus I want to I want to follow you and
[1:38:11] he says no why didn't you go back home
[1:38:13] and be a testimony of what I did for you
[1:38:16] of who I am that will speak louder
[1:38:20] go home and be a Christian in your
[1:38:22] neighborhood go home and be a Christian
[1:38:23] in your job go over there and be a light
[1:38:26] where you're at
[1:38:29] that'll speak louder
[1:38:30] because all he had that group following
[1:38:33] him everywhere they went
[1:38:34] as they followed by the Branham
[1:38:36] everywhere they went
[1:38:38] it was easy to be around somebody that
[1:38:40] God was using because you you could kind
[1:38:42] of just lean on them
[1:38:45] but when you're alone your light has to
[1:38:47] shine
[1:38:49] you have to be able to reach out to
[1:38:51] someone somebody come and say
[1:38:53] Hey Brother Daniel
[1:38:55] what is it about you that's different
[1:38:58] what is it about you sister that's
[1:39:01] different
[1:39:02] or as brother Daniel was talking to our
[1:39:04] sisters today back here he said why do
[1:39:06] you dress the way you dress
[1:39:08] why do you act the way you act now you
[1:39:11] have an opportunity to share what God
[1:39:14] has done for you in your life
[1:39:19] he's a real God
[1:39:21] he never fails
[1:39:24] and if he has to take your kicking and
[1:39:26] dragging he's going to take you kicking
[1:39:27] and dragging
[1:39:28] because he's going to get to you to
[1:39:30] where you need to be
[1:39:33] are you willing to say Amen to that
[1:39:37] so be it Lord
[1:39:39] sure Sunday night at service yes but
[1:39:41] what about Monday morning when you get
[1:39:42] up go to work
[1:39:44] what about when you get there on Monday
[1:39:46] and the boss says you know what I know
[1:39:47] we had all this plan but I'm going to
[1:39:49] need you and reroute you and send you
[1:39:50] the other way and you're already set all
[1:39:52] up for this
[1:39:55] could you be like Jesus said I must
[1:39:58] needs to go that way God has a reason
[1:40:01] Acts chapter 16.
[1:40:07] 16-34. we'll finish with this one
[1:40:13] and as it came to pass and as as we went
[1:40:15] this is the relating in Acts here and it
[1:40:18] came to pass as we went to prayer a
[1:40:20] certain damsel possessed with his Spirit
[1:40:22] of divination met us which brought her
[1:40:25] Masters much gained by soothsay
[1:40:29] the same followed Paul and us and cried
[1:40:31] saying these men are the Servants of the
[1:40:34] most high God which show unto us the way
[1:40:37] of Salvation And Thus did she many days
[1:40:41] but Paul being grieved turned and said
[1:40:43] to the spirit I command thee in the name
[1:40:46] of Jesus Christ to come out of her and
[1:40:49] he came out of her the same hour
[1:40:52] and I'm going to ask you a question you
[1:40:54] moms and dads you have a daughter a son
[1:40:57] who who's being used this way and you
[1:40:59] know it's not right
[1:41:02] would you not have been so happy
[1:41:05] so appreciative that God had just
[1:41:08] delivered your son or daughter
[1:41:12] well let's see and when her master saw
[1:41:16] that the hope of their gains was gone
[1:41:18] they caught Paul and Silas and Drew them
[1:41:22] into the marketplace unto the rulers
[1:41:24] and brought them to the magistrate
[1:41:26] saying these men being Jews do
[1:41:28] exceedingly trouble our city because
[1:41:31] they made one of ours well
[1:41:35] they're troubling our city because
[1:41:36] they're coming by and healing people
[1:41:38] they were more worried about the money
[1:41:40] in their pocket
[1:41:42] and teach Customs which are not lawful
[1:41:45] for us to receive neither to observe
[1:41:46] being Romans
[1:41:49] they would rather have their Customs
[1:41:51] than see someone delivered
[1:41:54] by God
[1:41:56] and the multitude wrote up together
[1:41:58] against them and the magistrates ran off
[1:42:00] their clothes and commanded to beat them
[1:42:02] and when they had laid many stripes upon
[1:42:05] them they cast them into prison charging
[1:42:07] the the Jailer to keep them safely
[1:42:11] now I've always said when Paul told
[1:42:14] Silas let's go with me why don't you go
[1:42:16] with me to the city
[1:42:18] I'm sure Silas is thinking wow we are
[1:42:20] going to see some wonderful Miracles God
[1:42:23] is going to move I've heard the
[1:42:24] testimonies of Paul ah some things
[1:42:26] they'll probably take us into the house
[1:42:28] and feed us well we'll be treated great
[1:42:31] and it doesn't go that way
[1:42:35] so
[1:42:37] who having received such a church thrust
[1:42:40] him into the inner prison and made their
[1:42:41] feet fast in the stalks
[1:42:44] clocked him up and I've always said
[1:42:46] Silas is looking at Paul and he said you
[1:42:49] never told me about any of this part of
[1:42:52] your experiences
[1:42:54] I didn't know that this was included in
[1:42:57] the package that were you know that I
[1:42:59] signed up for
[1:43:00] and at midnight now Paula Terminus said
[1:43:03] to to Silas and I'm just
[1:43:05] thinking that this is a way maybe to win
[1:43:07] he goes Silas I've been here before
[1:43:10] God always comes through and there's a
[1:43:11] reason for this
[1:43:13] and there's only one way really to get
[1:43:16] past
[1:43:18] begin to sing praises to Him let's just
[1:43:20] begin to worship let's begin to talk of
[1:43:23] his goodness let's remember the good
[1:43:25] things here let's talk about his
[1:43:27] goodness the Miracles do you remember
[1:43:28] when this happened let's encourage
[1:43:30] ourselves in Christ
[1:43:32] he says and at midnight Paul and Silas
[1:43:35] prayed and sang Praises unto God and the
[1:43:39] prisoners heard them
[1:43:40] and suddenly there was a great
[1:43:42] earthquake so that the foundations of
[1:43:45] the prison were shaken and immediately
[1:43:47] all the doors were open and everyone's
[1:43:49] bands were loosed that's amazing that
[1:43:52] God is able to shake foundations loose
[1:43:55] bands and unlock doors
[1:43:57] without the whole thing falling in on
[1:43:59] them
[1:44:00] her God is more than able to go to that
[1:44:03] situation you're in and deliver you out
[1:44:06] of it
[1:44:08] let him do it his way
[1:44:11] don't begin to tell him Lord I know you
[1:44:13] can but can you do it my way
[1:44:16] he goes I could but do you want to be in
[1:44:17] this twice as long
[1:44:19] or you want to be delivered today
[1:44:21] and suddenly there was a great
[1:44:23] earthquake so that the foundations of
[1:44:24] the printer were shaken and me
[1:44:26] immediately all the doors were open and
[1:44:28] everyone's bands were loosed and The
[1:44:31] Keeper of the prison Awakening out of
[1:44:33] his sleep seeing the prison doors open
[1:44:34] he drew his own sword and would have
[1:44:36] killed himself
[1:44:38] supposing that the prisoners had been
[1:44:40] fled I would think that would have been
[1:44:42] the first reaction I'm out of here
[1:44:45] God is delivering me I get to run from
[1:44:48] prison now this is a mighty work of God
[1:44:51] yes it was a mighty work of God but not
[1:44:53] for that reason
[1:44:55] but Paul cried with a loud voice saying
[1:44:57] do not do thyself no harm for we are all
[1:45:00] here
[1:45:01] then he called for a light and sprang in
[1:45:04] and came trembling and fell down before
[1:45:06] Paul inside us and brought them out and
[1:45:09] said sirs what must I do to be saved
[1:45:14] there's the reaction
[1:45:16] this is God's doing
[1:45:19] and I'm involved in the middle of it
[1:45:21] he's calling my name how do I react to
[1:45:23] it
[1:45:26] and they said believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:45:28] Christ and thou shalt be saved and thy
[1:45:31] house
[1:45:32] and they spake unto him the word of the
[1:45:34] Lord and to all that were in the house
[1:45:36] and he took them the same hour of the
[1:45:39] night and washed their stripes and was
[1:45:41] baptized he and all his straightway
[1:45:48] the other ones wanted him
[1:45:51] punished and all because he had taken
[1:45:53] away their money their gains and all
[1:45:57] but God said you're going to go through
[1:45:58] that because I've got a Jailer and a
[1:46:01] family that I got to go meet with
[1:46:07] God puts us in situations sometimes
[1:46:10] and if we'll just say Lord is there a
[1:46:12] reason for this
[1:46:14] could I testify to somebody
[1:46:16] could I be a light
[1:46:18] could I be a help
[1:46:21] how long was Joseph in the prison
[1:46:24] he was a young man when he went I
[1:46:25] believe it was 19 years
[1:46:29] all Joseph really had to look back to
[1:46:31] was you gave me some dreams
[1:46:35] that this would happen
[1:46:37] and I will stand on that
[1:46:39] I have your word that you said you'd
[1:46:41] never leave me you would never forsake
[1:46:44] me that all my steps are ordered by God
[1:46:49] therefore I will trust in you
[1:46:54] and you know
[1:46:55] I wonder how many times God has done
[1:46:57] things for us
[1:46:59] and we've not recognized it
[1:47:02] in the message here ye him
[1:47:07] and if you listen to brother Brandon I'm
[1:47:09] speaking this portion
[1:47:13] you can hear Brother Brandon's voice
[1:47:14] just as his heart's being torn apart
[1:47:18] this was when he went hunting with his
[1:47:20] friend Bert
[1:47:23] and there he's he's using that call to
[1:47:25] call the does in as a fawn call
[1:47:29] and that mother deer would automatically
[1:47:31] respond to it because that's her nature
[1:47:36] and I know that deer wasn't standing
[1:47:38] over 30 yards and I looked again around
[1:47:40] again and I saw him level that steady
[1:47:43] nerve putting that crosshairs right
[1:47:45] across the heart of that mother
[1:47:47] she looked around she heard the baby's
[1:47:49] cry she come walking out in the middle
[1:47:51] of that little place right out in the
[1:47:53] open Bert is using a call imitating a
[1:47:56] baby deer
[1:47:58] why she couldn't help it she was a
[1:48:00] mother
[1:48:00] she by Nature was a mother she wasn't
[1:48:02] putting that on she was a mother to
[1:48:04] begin with and there was a baby in
[1:48:07] trouble
[1:48:08] and she must get to it it was in trouble
[1:48:12] but it speaks to me of the heart of God
[1:48:16] when you and I were in trouble
[1:48:18] and something began to call out to him
[1:48:20] he says I must go
[1:48:24] there is no hope of Salvation if I don't
[1:48:27] go
[1:48:31] it was something in her any other time
[1:48:33] she'd have been scared to death that
[1:48:35] will that's what she was hiding back in
[1:48:38] the bushes for to keep away from that
[1:48:40] light Place till it got night
[1:48:42] and then she'd go out and feed but the
[1:48:44] baby was in trouble the mother instinct
[1:48:46] called her it was Duty she walked out
[1:48:48] listening again with those big ears up
[1:48:51] and I seen his nervous as he quieted
[1:48:54] down I turned my head I thought oh God
[1:48:56] don't let him do that
[1:48:59] I note in a few moments time just a
[1:49:01] second or two that bullet of the 30-06
[1:49:03] rifle would blow her the mother's heart
[1:49:05] right plumbed to the other side of her
[1:49:06] and thought that gallon display of real
[1:49:09] love that mother loving that little baby
[1:49:12] so much she's walking out there and I
[1:49:14] looked and she she'd seen the hunter she
[1:49:16] stopped those big ears come to a point
[1:49:19] she caught the scent of him and she
[1:49:21] stood there but the mother's love she
[1:49:23] couldn't help it she went walking on
[1:49:26] Hunting that baby it wasn't a put on it
[1:49:29] was the real thing
[1:49:30] she was right walking right into the
[1:49:32] face of death because she was a mother I
[1:49:35] turned my head I said God how can that
[1:49:38] cruel-hearted man do that
[1:49:42] this is Brother branham's thoughts
[1:49:45] how can that cruel-hearted man do that
[1:49:50] and when I while I was praying I noticed
[1:49:52] the silence I heard nothing I thought
[1:49:55] why don't the gun fire then I turn to
[1:49:58] look and I saw the rifle barrel going
[1:50:01] like this he dropped the rifle on the
[1:50:03] ground and turned around and grabbed me
[1:50:05] by the pan Lake and he said Billy I've
[1:50:07] had enough of it I can't stand it more
[1:50:10] tell me about this Jesus that puts that
[1:50:13] kind of love into a man's heart
[1:50:17] there on the snowy ground that
[1:50:18] cruel-hearted man by the display of a
[1:50:21] real genuine love
[1:50:23] LED that man to Christ
[1:50:25] a mother dear being who she was
[1:50:31] she couldn't help it she was a mother
[1:50:33] dear and she was going to give herself
[1:50:36] and it broke a man's heart
[1:50:39] and God reached out and touched
[1:50:42] he still does the same
[1:50:46] he still doesn't change
[1:50:53] if
[1:50:55] if I would finish this and our sisters
[1:50:57] could come up
[1:51:10] God here
[1:51:12] and just how he spoke it to me
[1:51:14] after what
[1:51:16] brother Daniel said about Alex was
[1:51:18] when he said
[1:51:20] they're self-righteous
[1:51:22] they're depending on their own works
[1:51:25] they think they're good enough
[1:51:28] I said I can't reach them
[1:51:30] they don't think
[1:51:32] they need my help
[1:51:34] he said it's easier me for me to walk
[1:51:37] out into the streets with them
[1:51:39] because they know they need help
[1:51:43] they know they can't save themselves
[1:51:46] and he just began to talk to me about
[1:51:48] these different ones
[1:51:53] never get to a point in their lives
[1:51:56] where we say Lord I can handle this
[1:52:00] but to say Lord let me depend on you
[1:52:03] let me surrender myself
[1:52:05] let me yield to you
[1:52:08] and you can have your own way
[1:52:11] for just powerheads
[1:52:15] [Music]
[1:52:17] Lord You Know Each one here you know
[1:52:19] them by name
[1:52:22] these are not to those that you would
[1:52:24] say I never knew you
[1:52:26] you never talked to me
[1:52:28] these are your children your redeemed
[1:52:32] help us all Lord to keep our Spirits
[1:52:34] humble
[1:52:36] our attitudes to say Lord let you have
[1:52:39] your way you'll be in charge of this you
[1:52:43] direct my path
[1:52:45] you be my light and I'll walk step by
[1:52:47] step in that light
[1:52:50] never get to a point where we feel we
[1:52:52] know enough
[1:52:53] I've got a greater Revelation I'm way
[1:52:57] beyond that
[1:52:59] what to say like Paul said brother I
[1:53:02] will trust in his grace and I will glory
[1:53:05] in my infirmity in other words Lord I
[1:53:07] will realize before you that I can't but
[1:53:10] you can and you will
[1:53:13] Lord and let that Grace and that mercy
[1:53:15] be expressed
[1:53:17] so someone out there some way fair and
[1:53:20] stranger someone walking down the road
[1:53:22] out front of the church or by the house
[1:53:24] or at work
[1:53:25] or turn around and say what is it about
[1:53:28] you
[1:53:29] that there's a peace in this situation
[1:53:31] there's a light about you there's a hope
[1:53:33] about you there's something about you
[1:53:36] I don't have
[1:53:38] how can I have it
[1:53:42] and it was and we could share then this
[1:53:45] Jesus Christ the Jesus Christ that's the
[1:53:48] same yesterday today and forever Lord
