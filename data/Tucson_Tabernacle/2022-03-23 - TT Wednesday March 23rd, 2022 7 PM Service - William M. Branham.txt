given us the down payment of that the earnest let's just go to him in prayer lord jesus we're so grateful for this opportunity to gather together with believers of like precious faith lord we come before your throne lord not because we're worthy but as a song is said lord we come through the blood you don't see us as we are you don't see us as we see ourselves but you see us as you want us to

in jesus precious name amen a couple of praises we were at the park yesterday and abel loved to climb and he fell from pretty high up and landed right on his foot he was in a lot of pain and so we just quickly prayed and didn't know if he broke it or what and pretty shortly he was in pain for a little while but he was doing good and able to walk and we're just really thankful don't know what the situation was before we prayed but you know after we prayed everything was good and then later that day jonas goes and he bites his tongue really hard his tongue is bleeding everywhere quickly prayed and i was okay got better and then today lydia's doing some housework and ended up putting her finger in a light socket and could have been bad but she she was not electrocuted fully only partially so thankful for that thankful for a good wife just thankful to the lord for all that he's done all that he's doing all that he's gonna do um just a reminder we've got prayer meetings

you we're going to listen to a tape tonight from 1956. the 28th of july making the valley full of ditches so let's just listen hear what the lord has for us you may be seated god bless and in our hearts right now present tense so happy for that and last evening we had a marvelous healing service our lord jesus met with us that gave us exceedingly london now tomorrow's another evening service tomorrow night at the lord willing now tomorrow morning i think the broadcast is what's going on nine o'clock over at and uh uh uh speak a few minutes over there and one thing by promise said to do it and then uh tomorrow at 10 30 the more that i believe at 10 30 is the drama of the smallest ship in the world now come out in the morning if you can see what the smallest ship is especially this is dedicated to the children children from eight to eighty i said the other night and we um are expecting the lord to meet what they said then tomorrow night again here at 7 30. the prayer cards will be given out at 6 30 and there will be prayer for the stick tomorrow night the lord willing and now be expecting and coming all prepared right up and out tonight is a bad night saturday night this is the devil's national the one when the devil gets on the highways and all the booth joints and all the liquor running crowd all the lowdowns boogie boogies rock and rolls and all that's rolling and rocking tonight 100 people die i see the other day we're in a certain place that they had a big jamboree one of these jamborees to have here they took it up to canada and i forget how many children they had to send to the insane institution after going through that boogie looking rock and roll affair they brought from america to canada they farted out of many countries and many states in the union and yet we americans plunged headlong into it the other day seeing where a young man it's one of the heads of this rock and roll and going through all these maneuvers he said he learned it in a pentecostal church and i think that that would be perverted no one of the boys got a perverted mind going crazy certainly god will punish him and he will certainly for such as that have sacrifices and it's it's absolutely blasphemy of the holy ghost and it's terrible to see how that people can kind of belittle the words of the living god as you soul so shall you read remember that i'll thank you can i forget just how many it was at the first morning outfits they had up there how many children how many young people that lost their mind over that one meeting and the insane institution now without hope without god without and mercy laying there in that condition screaming and crying and walking the up and down button our heads against the wall or that kind of nonsense and we make it wrinkled drink gamble a lot of places that allow the kids to smoke in the church at school just before semester and so forth isn't that terrible they're quieting their nerves or they have a prayer meeting that's the best but you know hungry people have got to fill that longing with something if they won't drink from the fountain of the waters of life the devil will give them a stagnated system with wiggles [Music] so they'll ring from somewhere you'll spend that loyalty and worship either on the devil or on god never one other person never went to one of those places or done any of those things except it was a hungry-hearted person that refused to drink from the fountain of the waters of life freezing ah i'll tell you i feel sorry for them because of the let down and pollution of our modern churches that's one of the things that i lay it to this social gospel that people preach while in our own city of jeffersonville a certain pastor every saturday night has a square dance at the bottom of the church ryan teach the square dancing of a very famous denominational church a square name that was the same pastor that asked me that time coming down the telephone pole how i got so many people the house and tabernacles that he signed i made him sign a card a thousand members that they would attend sunday school at least one time out of the year or one or six months out of every year's workbook he said you don't have any answers except two i said no wonder i don't blame them i wouldn't either it's actually like as long as you're having shin digs and things in the church well that's a sin i don't belong in the house of god i have to have something like that to get a people listen to me i'll sure go off the field of the gospel preaching the gospel i don't blame sinners when you see sinners going out there this whole rank low down centers well i don't blame them that's all they know but these people who go to church and call themselves christians i don't blame a pig from rooting in a manure pile certainly not that's his nature certainly i would think this train see a pig in the newer pounds or not that's his nature that's what he does that's his living you don't know any different but i sure feel funny about seeing a lamb doing that and praying that he wouldn't do it and that's way to the center let him go ahead that's all he knows drink all the booze he wants to go all the low downs and hold down to listen to all that nonsense that's all he knows but do you think we're supposed to know better that's right i've persuaded if you ever turn to that you never really drink from the fountain of the lord i tell you that just that just cuts all that other stuff this is midnight there's no joy to it it's saying you can't even stand it i go into a restaurant sometime first thing i do i look through and see if you got one little penny or nipple uh jukeboxes on the wall and things make me so nervous i can i i have a sour stomach after i come out just to hear all that nonsense and see christians playing supposed to be christian brother by the fruits you know well that ain't my subject but i tell you it's too bad that we don't have a little more contenting the baptist church but not the guy having shake hands about your name on the book brother we get out the door and beat one another back so he come through we had something yes sir and one of those people was caught all those kind of places they were put right on the cards if it was sold they either repented or excommunicated right there we didn't work yet you yoke yourself up with unbelievers they either walk the street narrow line but had a blackboard sit there and if anybody had ingredients to steam one to it they put all their names on the blackboard i got them both in the prayer room somebody come in like jones up to the top next was uh scott at the bottom all right brother jones jim brother scott come in here with me that's right head straighten it out right then have it be made right church rolled on that's what we need to know there's a good old fashioned bat woods sing killing sky right amen now remember the services now may the lord bless us as we open his word to read just a few uh scriptures here and then speak to you on the word and everybody be solely and in prayer believing with all your heart and i'm wondering tonight some of them would tell me about a little baby the last one was prayed for last night the little fella got started crying right didn't that baby here tonight would have to be that the little fella was sure i'd like him to climb up to the platform here just a moment if he did um i guess they might have been from out i don't know them keeps me it's in a semi-conscious condition and my son was telling me going out said daddy it was a marvelous thing he said a little boy come in the line down there look i think he said a cross-eyed and had a rupture or something other and say when you pick the child up i think you put your hands over that place and it went away he said and when the child opened his eyes and when you had your hand laying on it said i noticed his eyes as perfectly straight as it could be and said you're trying to get him to look to the audience and i just wondered if he was here tonight maybe he'd be back and we're thanking the lord for his healing now the lord can heal all kinds of diseases if we can believe him to do it i've not seen him do so many things i just want to believe that everything we ask for that's right we gotta believe it that way and now we trust that the lord will bless now this blessed old book is the book of all books and there's only one candidate rightly interpret this book and that's the holy spirit he's a writer and it's the only one that can really interpret no matter how well we think we know it we don't know it until the holy spirit has revealed it because it's it's all in mystery it's all cut up in mystery and god said he did it personally so he could hide it from the smart and wise but he would reveal it the veins such as we learned now we want to be babes in the lord tonight just see how simple you can be and tomorrow night i think i have the lord willing i have a message on that on the simplicity of it so now let us bower it's just one more moment to speak how many has a knee tonight would you raise your hands i want to be remembered in this brother i want you to remember me before the lord our heavenly father in the name of jesus our beloved child we come as humbly as we know how and ask you for forgiveness of our sins and trespasses whatever we have dinner said to this day or any other time in our life that's against us tonight we humbly bow and confess and i pray for this audience of people as they raise their hands many of them father are maybe desperately in need of forgiveness some but setting sin some habit some sickness some disease or affliction some loved one that's in trouble whatever it is father i pray that you forgive and forget all their iniquity and heal all their diseases and pour out thy blessings upon us tonight through the reading of the word and the preaching of the word or we asked it in christ's name our beloved son amen in the second kings and the third third chapter of the second kings and the 16th verse and he said thus saith the lord make this valley full of niches now may the lord add his blessings to the reading of his word this was in the book of second kings the third chapter and maybe when you would go home how many reads the bible let's see your hand oh it's wonderful read it study it and you especially you born again christians that's the the bread and the meat for the holy spirit man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that's right that proceedeth out of the mouth of god amen what if i was a doctor tonight the young fellow come to me i had a great frame on him and yet he looked so weak and run down i said what's the matter son he said i'm just a weak doctor i can't always stand up i ask them a few physical things all right they're all right i said what makes you weak i don't know doctor i would say well when did she eat that well i eat a half a cracker a day before yesterday was the only thing you need is a good square of evil you become anemia you become run down we that's what's made of the church you've got to have a good square gospel meal that i ever age that's right if you don't you're going to be anemia you're going to get run down taking a lot of god's vitamins out of his word and it certainly does bring up the spirit and makes you feel repressed and renewed now it's just been a great event taking place and there's been a house cleaning time in israel but the bad part of it was by the vote of the people and the run of the of the way they voted in they had just not made it as bad as what they would today if one pastor would leave the church and the deacon board would go in another who sometimes has taken out a good one a bad one but when god sends one along he's the right man always you should pray and seek god's favor you who are have such to select your pastor but now it was in the days of elijah elijah the mighty prophet of the lord oh god what will we do if we didn't have some man of god in the world that would stand in the preaching and try to intercede for the people and with enough nerve to tell the people are not enough nerve but enough grace to tell the people what's right and wrong a whole lot of that is a matter of the troubles today is because man in one sense i'm not condemning my brethren certainly not i'm i'm only trying to present a truth the only reason today that the conditions are if every pastor would have stood firm on the word and not let out or compromise it wouldn't be like it is today but a compromising self-sufficient organizations and so forth has always tried to take the place of the holy spirit and god never did have any kind a group of man to run his church it's always been the holy spirit that's his duty that's right that's what he shared that's what god sent him for he will teach you he will guide you into all truth and will show you things to come and reveal these things take these things of mine and reveal them to you not the seminary as good as they are not the church as good as it is but the holy spirit that's the teacher right amen and we tried to adopt man to take the holy spirit's place we tried to adopt certain different offices in the church to take the offices of the apostle prophet and so forth in the church that god set the gifts in the church and we helped man and made him gifts instead of god's gift and that's what we're in today now elijah was a great man and his time had come for him to leave the earth and he walked before the lord and the lord told him go and anoint another man i love that don't you love that god has never been without a witness that's right amen god's always had a witness since the world began sometimes come down to one man but god's always had someone he could lay his finger on and say this is my servant all ages now and when he said he was going to take elijah elijah the fish fight went and found elijah crying in the field and took off his rope and threw it on him and he knew he was called to be the prophet then to show how a prophet should he burn every bridge as we call it he killed the ox took the yokes the plan and made a sacrifice to the lord showing that all of his earthly doings were over he was completely sold out to the lord amen that's the kind way every man and woman that comes to christ's heart to completely sell out the sin and everything behind him proves a separating line and look only to god from now on what a difference it would be if men and women would do that that to giving this test do you believe in the testings and trying trials of the lord every son without any exception every son that cometh to god that's first be tested tried child trained remember how you got your training i remember how i got mine my daddy had a he believed in the golden rule and he had it and it laid up where the door had all the team commandments on a big long hickory stick about this long with a brush on the end of it i'm telling you when that little brand's done wrong they didn't know what the golden rule and you say now tomorrow i'm really going to pan to you why don't you do it now papa get it over with no i'll just wait till tomorrow as you get to eat this dinner you say come here billy yes or dad sit down a minute get his knife out go to women now you knew better than that didn't you oh i wish you just let me get older you say but you knew better that didn't yes dad i did ain't [Music] and that was a good schooling if we had some more that would do like that today we wouldn't have so much juvenile delinquency you talk about teaching the child i went into a household not long ago it's a visit a person that was sick and in condole junior little oswald and he walked in he said he could go about getting ready and she said sonny i've been so sick and this is brother branham so uh why don't you got some dinner ready for me she said i've been real sick that's no excuse she said there's an orange he looked at it and said that's all you're gonna do blanket he's blank and do it against the wall and the jews went all the places and junior behave yourself and it kicked over something and walked out i'll look down some other i thought lady you just give me the privilege for a few minutes i'll make him think different from that the next time you come in the house oh how we're gonna let out you're trying to be you're too good to kids nowadays right your baby you can't go beyond the bible the bible said if you spare a rod you support a job that's right pop used to take the old gun stick i don't know where you know what it is or not like you slow the muzzle over with if you ran wrong right brother i got an education with that thing he didn't make me walk around i was in the grave tonight when i looked up on him when he was laying there the black locks laying around little great i thought it was not honored ever equipping my that's right he's my daddy now i loved him because he tried to make me do right he was determined that i would do right and now somebody talk about the illiteracy of the hillbillies up in kentucky there but how the old grandma there's long bonnets and things on you don't want they could teach some of you city people how to behave yourself right your little martha anne come into the night time and mess up all over her face and a half drunk smoking a cigarette blowing it through her nose and stomp her foot and scream at you let her do that one of those kentucky mammies one time should top a hickory boy or take something or a barrel slap when she got through she knew who was manly around there if you do that she wouldn't have so many wrong man and boys and girls in the world tonight let one of them stretch yourself and some of these old dirty clothes like you let your kids wear out your little sharks and whatever what you call them and let them one time you find out how illiterate they were beat her until she'd be so well she couldn't get the clothes on top of them that's what needs to be done tonight that's right and some of these 65 preachers stand in the full pit and left their choirs sing and they go out on the afternoon and stretch out those things shame on you to call yourself a man of god you got a wishbone and not a backbone you had the holy ghost to make you act different from that and talk different from that and make you call black black and white white yes yes sir but the trouble of it is all mine you're so feminist anyhow little why don't you get a backbone get the holy ghost john the baptist was the first one to receive the holy ghost and he walked right up to old head and said it's not lawful for you to have your brother's wife that's right brother that's the way a man feel the holy ghost when he sees something wrong he calls it wrong [Music] certainly now was that type of man and when elijah knew that he was to take his place elijah gave him a trial he said you stay here because i'm going to another city and he elijah knew that he had to watch him he's inspired he says that the lord liveth on your soul to die i'll not depart from you on and on they went until finally the last trial and they crossed jordan he said now what can i do bargain he said that a double portion of your spirit would come up on me now that seems strange the spirit of a man coming up on another i want a double potion of your spirit that you've asked a hard thing but nevertheless if you see me when i go you'll have it so they walked on and after a while the chariots of pine horses of fire came down and elijah stepped on and pulled off his robe and threw it back to elijah and he put it on and walked down to the river with a double potion of the spirit of elijah a beautiful type of the church jesus said these things that i do shout you also have more than this shall you do can you be baptized for the baptism i am baptized with can you drink from the cup that i drink said yes you will and a double potion you see it out of the holy spirit was to come upon the church and a double of what jesus did was to be done by the church or where is the faith of the church tonight my god that's a praise god back in the shell like a turtle time now listen the only thing that you need to do is to come out notice then when he walked down he began to perform miracles and one on eight elijah and elisha was 16 a double potion of the spirit was upon him during that time old king ahab had died because the prophet had told him how his end was going to be and his little pain in face white she died too and the dog's eater just according to the word of the lord she hated that preacher worse than anything because he was always telling her how about her sin how could he be honest and sincere with god and keep from doing it god had told me that he was going to feed her to the dogs and she didn't become nothing but dog meat and so no matter how much your little pretty painted up rose gold lips was when she stole them up oh jay who said turn off the window she wasn't vamping him with her vampy eyes he was the man of god they cried out the window and the dogs eat her up on the street that's right and then when they went to slept in another they got jerome his son and her son now you couldn't expect very much to come out of a marriage like that so then we find out that when jerome had ascended to the throne he was a borderline believer just a halfway lukewarm believer so many of them in the world tonight jeremy just said he sailed anyway the wind was blowing that's the way jerome would go that's what's the matter with the church tonight they set their sales to every form of doctrine talks about them not knowing where to stand or what to do when their little trials come up the little frictions away they go this way they're not tomorrow pentecostal next day of lutheran the next day seventy-eight minutes jehovah witness they don't know where to stand about borderline packing your church letter from one place to what doesn't do anyhow but apart in heaven that's where it'll be recognized that's right notice dan a lukewarm preacher or believer so many tonight are in the same way they're with the crowd if they're in the crowd they'll do as the crowd does next they make their way back to church here some time ago a young man told me he said preacher i'm not a christian he said i'm ashamed to admit it i said now these hopes for you when you're ashamed to admit it he said i'm not a christian i'm ashamed of it but i took a certain girl tonight a boy another boy i had her now and she was so drunk she couldn't hardly get in and we walked her and gave her soft water to vomit it up she had to be sober enough to tan shirts the next morning and said if you'll wake up come out and get another bottle we'll be on the road again and she was a singing in the car and her sister talked sunday school and wasn't any better no wonder we've got a bunch of infotainment skeptics and believers and make believers and everything else the church needs an old passion holy ghost god sent revival and creatures together right let the righteous wrath of god rained down through old-fashioned hell fine brimstone preaching too bad he ever got away with an insensibility when the holy spirit left the man he didn't know better why we need the returning of the holy spirit yes sir now borderline here's some time ago a young lady right in our city everybody thought last summer his little girl went out there at the church get long hair and slit your air right back to her face and just about as slick as the peeled onion i guess but she was really a genuine christian born again so this little girl that went to a modernistic affair down there she's better on the streets she said rose you don't want said you'd be a pretty girl if you just use a little bit of that and if you'd wear this kind of clothes and that kind of coat she said i'll wear just exactly what i want to wear oh that was telling her she said the trouble of this is that narrow-minded preacher pastor billy you got us there said that god would have been the insane institution and the little girl said well if you had what we had a bed you wouldn't be looking the way you're looking now she told her about yet she was a sunday school teacher now mr perkins a friend of mine dear friend at jeffersonville he had the in the embalming at the undertaker example and then this girl taken down sick and they didn't know what it wasn't it was an ill and the family never let it out because it was a disgrace and when the girl had taken down this disease and she started to die she called for the pastor and the church to come and sing hymns to her and when she was singing out there they were and death struck her if every one time that you'll get right with god or try to as my death really sit down and when death struck her the pastor she began to kind of begin to scream she said i'm lost another pastor said here here here you can't act like that said you know you're saying i'm lost he called the doctor and put a high pole in her arm and she told him she said you deceive her she said i'm lost and i'm going to hell and you're the cause and she said stand for that aurora mahoney just as quick as you can and get her here and she'll pray for me but they couldn't get the girl should already die and when mr perkins told me he said billy when i was pumping the fluid into that girl we we noticed that i began to smell it but she's taking too much fluid for her body and so we had to examine her and when they did there was holes eating that everywhere were nero and there she was died oh my and that disgrace is all because that she was told that tap dancing and all the other nonsense it goes with the simple vaseline life was all right by a babson preacher oh my god that was the cause of it and she spent it to his face in the days of her death and what will she do younger worldly has to stand in the presence of god and give account for everything that's done and god will require that jesus's hand that's real soul that's right certainly it is true that's right over what we [Music] that have taken place that still hangs on a record in jeffersonville of how that girl went out of line now a borderline lukewarm they try to make it smooth that's why this jerome was just a borderline preacher and he every way the people they wanted to do this one all right they want to do that all right but yet he claimed to be a christian or a believer and first thing you know there was more rebelled against israel so then he called for help now the king of judah was jehoshaphat and jehoshaphat was a righteous man now i want you to notice how easy it is sometimes on a little persuasion for a christian to get into the wrong company trying to be pity well i'll tell you i'll just put out the pool room i won't play any pool but i'll go down i'll go to dance with susie because she's a good girl and maybe i could win her to the lord you'll never do it doing that right show your colors right don't get on the wrong ground that's what's the matter with the pentecostal church tonight it got on the wrong ground that's the reason of church tonight the people it used to be wrong for the people to do certain things now it's not wrong to do it anyhow you've got on the wrong grounds you got with the wrong crowd show me your company i'll tell you who you are let me walk into your house let me see what's laying over on the table let me see how that bible is marked up let me see what's all true stories let me listen to what kind of music you're running on your radio let me see what kind of pictures you got in your house i'll tell you what you're made out of yes sir that's what your souls are feeding on regardless of what your testimony is your fruits prove what you are [Music] [Applause] oh it's the truth your soul feeds on something and whatever the characteristic of your soul is that's what it'll show for that's the reason jesus said by their fruits you shine all them you talk a lot of advantage of saying i spoke in tongues i got the holy ghost if your life didn't type up with it you didn't do it you either got the devil or the flesh i'm talking to the pentecostal people are you bad that's already shallower than you presenterians sure that's right now i don't care what kind of a sign you might have cried tears like a crocodile and you might have moaned at the bench i don't mean you're saved your life proves what you are if you ever hear a goat blade a goat that sheeps almost the same thing i've heard goats crying when it's act like sheep it takes a real shepherd to know the difference do you hear a goat squealing it sounds just exactly like a sheep but a shepherd knows the voice right now but something happened and we find out that this jehoshaphat all over spell of emotion before praying over before you cut your hair sister did you get out and pray over [Music] [Music] i'm afraid you didn't you have your mind already made up what you go to do before you pray that's right are you willing to as i said tonight god share all things off of you take all your your rights you say this in my life i'm an american i don't do i won't do that right but are you willing to forfeit them to the kingdom of god if you're a lamb you are if you're a vulture so there you are so now you might bleed and crying you might act like it you might eat the same grass that the goat from the shaped up and over the orange you're not long ago i seen a shepherd and he was hurting sheep goats donkeys and cannons all the same breads and i said what does a shepherd mean he said the shepherd is a grazer said like you'd call in america your cowboy and i said well then why is it that he's hurting the goats and everything he said that's right oh i said i see he said but brother branham when night time comes the everything is left on the pasture except the sheep and the sheep stuck to the bowl and he lays down to the door to see that nothing bothers them that i see you can set the same church shop for the same gospel but if your nature isn't different you will never be recognized at the setting of the sun that's right preachers have to be in your heart not in your head you say i'd like to do that but i better not do it because the church wouldn't like it i don't think you knew what the church says it's what god said what your conscience says what the holy spirit says in him god amen right he said you love the world or things of the world love it god's not even in you that's all right so don't feel borderline come out and be one side or the other let your colors shine that's right now i want you to notice jehoshaphat got messing around and he got with that crown they said will you go up with us when you come over and join our church he said well i guess i might as well go into the association i imagine it's all right i'll be a little independent fellow up here maybe if i joined the association i'd be better off i'll have the fellowship then of israel down here and uh all these other fellows up in here maybe if i could just charm the association yeah sometimes you make a mistake but doing that yeah i got nothing against the association but just stay the way you are of god now the first thing you know he goes up there and after a while uh he said well you work with me to battle said sure we're all christians anyhow we're all believers anyhow that he wanted to be a mixer and that's what the world is looking for today is a mixer but god wants separators you know just some time ago i heard a church up in the northern part of indiana was making their choice for a pastor and a whole bunch of them almost 100 percent unanimously voted on a guy because of his looks great big fine looking young man and i asked an old grandmother i said how did you vote in that case i see him give the brother a bible that day when he brought him into the church and give him the privileges of either pastor i said oh she said he was such a handsome looking fellow i said but that's not all of it sister the thing of it is what does he preach what does he feed with does he feed with some kind of little recreation program does he talk about roses and flowers or who's going to be the next president or some baseball game or some fish fry or party or does he preach the word of god yes sir nice one young lady i said well what about you and she give me her excuse for it but look that's when people vote they vote by their sign one time there had to be a selection maybe would take saul's place down in israel and so saw with the head and shoulders above all his army so even the prophet got the heart of the world and went to jesus house to not one of his sons to be king the lord told him to but he said don't you not but who i called for and then they run out the great big oldest one there great big seven footer but why won't he look good standing the fulfillment with his clothes just fitting him just right and all about it that's what america wants to do pending costs here get ready pentecost is full of hollywood evangelism why in louisville kentucky a bunch of people coming there not long ago and i went over there to a revival center thought i'd get my soul all fed up and i got over there and a woman on a platform with great big earrings hanging down and with the clothes on look like she's been poured into them and run up down the aisle in hallelujah he'll give the next 50. and i never heard such and their music sound like some kind of rock and roll boogie woogie that's got its place but not on the platform amen i just almost i thought they're building my followings i went out to see people how far away don't think because your pentecostal god's going to take you in on that name you won't do it you've got to have the article brother right notice here you are joining himself up associating with unbelievers so they fixed them a compass for seven days and got out into the desert on out to fight the kings of moab and when they got out there they found out that they were out of water their water supply was cut off and things go wrong when the water's cut off do you know that now in the public utility if you don't pay the bill they'll cut the water on them you got up around the house and that's what's the matter with god's people tonight they just didn't pay the price and god's cut the water off that's right that's all get allowed in the desert go to any desert you want to that's the reason some of you full gospel church members and so forth don't believe in divine healing your water's been cut off out in the desert you say full gospel the dirtiest i ever was treated was by a pentecostal pastor against divine healing i asked him if i could rent some seats for him i had a big meeting in the city and because a certain church was sponsored he said anybody that about anything i wouldn't even let set on my seat that was pentecostal sure that's right but then a gun shot this and all wasn't worried you're setting nine that's right would be a little farther now i suppose we've got about 200 miles but look that would be the big cannon guns we're shooting today but notice that's what he said and he wouldn't let me have him and the people had to stand but we had the meeting just the same but i noticed that's the reason out of the desert everything you come in contact in the desert's got stickers on i don't care if it's a little leaf or whatever it is don't fool with it cause it's got a sticker on you know what does that is because it ain't end of water where there's no water against stickers where there's water that same plant will soften up and make leaves and that's what's the matter with the church really so much buttons i'm a [Music] oh we don't believe in that we believe in dancing this way we believe in this should do this liberation of women or whether it's oh my what's the matter your water supply is cut off right so they found out they were without water and when you're without water without life then they said what can we do about it we're starting a prayer meeting it's a bad time to start a man [Music] of the king of israel and said said why you know what we've got a man we've got down here by the name of elisha he poured water on elijah's hands in other words his association was pretty good he really had some dealings with the real prophet birth of a feather flocked together that's right how can you expect anybody to believe you when you're running around and acting the way you do and then come in and call yourself christians no wonder they don't call for income pray for them and so forth that's right now birds of a feather flocked together and it said well but this man poured water on his eyes and the tishbites they poured water on his hands he had some dealings with him being a spiritual man the first thing he thought of was to visit the prophet and when a real child of god ever gets in trouble the first thing he goes to is god right straight back to god yeah amen so let's go to him quickly somebody went down there and drove up brock elijah was in there reading the scriptures perhaps and when they all drove up in front of the kings well here they come in and he said what shall we do and elijah got his righteous incarnation all stirred up oh he could bore over once in a while he looked at old jerome standing there he said why don't you get to the prophet of your daddy and your mother why'd you come to me wow wasn't very peaceful was he why don't you go back to your pagan gods why'd you come down to me a prophet a servant of the lord a mighty man double portion of the spirit on me why don't you go to your mother's god and your father's god and listen to what he said if it wasn't that i respected the presence of jehoshaphat i wouldn't even look at you you talk about being stirred up and i believe that's the same thing tonight i believe this america will be blown to pieces i believe the thing has done been sunk in god if god didn't respect the real genuine christians in america that's praying to hold it together amen i believe it had been gone long ago i believe the jacks would have took it or some other nation if god hadn't respected the honest sincere prayers of born again children of god that if i didn't respect the presence of that righteous man i wouldn't even look at you so he got himself all stirred up so you know when you get all stirred up and round up like that it's not a good time to do any service for the lord so you know what he said said nevertheless go get me a menstrual start praying plan now you people who don't believe in music in the church what about that yeah say go get me a miserable i'm all round up today my righteous dignity is born over that guy come up here that borderline preacher stand up here leading them children wrong down there and doing that take a hold of him bro i gotta see a vision now so bring me an israel and then when you got all the music and they got the play in the music some real good hymn and the first thing you know when the songs return to zion when the music and the children begin to sing from their heart something takes place the spirit of the lord tell the prophet at the real old-fashioned godly sin and repenting will bring the spirit of god on the prophet then he'll do the same thing today and notice he wanted to see the way out and the only way out they could do would be he had a revival so he had some repented sinners that come in and the music played and the prophets saw an engine and the only way you're ever going to see your way out is an old-fashioned spiritual revival where the hallelujahs of god is ringing from the bottom of their heart have an old passion holy ghost sent revival typically then you begin to see things then god will be able to reveal things then you wonder why these real christians are hanging on while they're praying for you what a revival any god in the spirit now the reason that these people have dances is they can have a dance let's get the spear down you can't have a ball game unless you get the spirit of a ball game you've got to get in the spirit of it and we can never have a revival shreveport reporter anywhere else until the church gets in the spirit of revival god can come and perform miracles he can show wonder he can stretch forth his hand and he was sick and afflicted the preacher can preach the gospel as hard as he can but there will never be a revival until the church gets in the spirit of revival amen amen america's going to sleep times thousands of great miracles and signs and wonders and events with students hearts are burning man and audience got to make decisions some of them are standing on the borderline many other great man are turning to god and receiving the holy ghost one of the foremost men of america in the evangelical room come the other day to indianapolis and has received the baptism of the holy ghost yes sir oh my nations are breaking israel's awaiting the signs of the bible foretold we're at the end times that's right and there's life if you want to walk in it and notice at this man tell me how happy you are and how i've been liberated and said brother brown i come upon the recommendation of other great man he told me who he was mark street head and other other ones how that they had received the baptism of the holy ghost and revolutionize our life and now they're out preaching another outstanding man he's trying to come to a showdown pretty soon or what he's going to do about it but he made the remarks said i don't care what the politics of a church says i want god amen can it cost you you better be putting in your up your shield your armor if you don't watch out the badness and presbyterian so we're gonna pass you on bye god's name will need stones to rise children on abraham don't think because you belong to the siblings of the church of god or the ubc that you just got or you ain't gotta make it at all right god's the one has made the way you're not walking watching the sign the pentecostal just say first day of reality so is that wonderful my my old mother we just can't have a center around here anymore we got to pray through everybody else praying to and the first thing you know they watched it for a while and they said oh well i guess it's all right god performed something he said yeah we have a revival oh my god then here comes the practice in the presbyterian the nazarenes the pilgrim horns and then come along seeing the baptist the holy ghost they're stepping in and grabbing it like that is better than the camp sure god is able to stone this right turn unto abraham you won't walk in it god turn over give it somebody else it's exactly right great things are going to make me right now amen now he said now i saw a vision i see the way out i know what to do and i'll tell you whether today the church hasn't got the vision or they have more prayer to be more spiritually what they are unless there is a vision unless someone can see the vision see the coming of the lord seeing the things that we're going through and see all these things that god predicted that would be in the last days and here we are instead of reading the bible we're reading love stories considering that we read everything else we already reading god's vibe and our knees constantly praying for god to help us awakening our soul or crying out to the lord but we don't now notice and then when he said he see you have a way out i said the first thing i want you to do is go out here and make this valley full of dishes dig just as hard as you can for thus saith the lord you'll not see any wind or there'll be any rain but this valley will be full of water more ditches of more water what did he see he saw a vision of that spiritual rock that moses had already smitten and been speaking to he had just spoke to that rock and it was ready to pour forth the water when ditches was made fortunate and i'll say that same smitten rock tonight is here and it'll pour forth an old-fashioned holy ghost revival that'll cherish report apart if your people are going to dig in moving all the difficult times if you dig up against one thing a beer cans enough in the ice box throw it up make way for the holy ghost every time you hit against the snake throw the thing out the thing for you take the little water you get but what you have to have is to make a way for it no matter how much preaching there is how many visions they are the subject was saying and the main principle was make ready for the water get the ditches dug that's what we got to do tonight is to make way for the holy ghost to pull down make it into your house make it in your turn make it yourself take everything out of the way get ready there's cunning adventure if you make ready for if you don't make ready for it you'll never see it that's up to the church tonight got a nice tip here you got a nice view of church in the seats got nice people got nice singing we got a wonderful savior but get everything outside everything every sin that's the eastern is touching brother i don't do nothing maybe that's what's the matter that's a trouble amen there's more sin not to do what it is to do when you know better right either good news or not the human sin you've got to make ready doing nothing is the worst thing you can do do nothing about it your southerners remember your history went up here when grant was sent just across the river and he had a boy out there on guard duty and the rebels was across the river and this boy walking along there kind of dazed around with the dreams of his sweetheart he left his post of duty and went on to pick some violence just saying to his sweetheart he didn't mean to do wrong he went then at that time there was a spy already from the southern army and they slipped in and he looked around he found out that the southern army was two or three times the size of general grant what was happening the boy come back on the poster duty not knowing what happened but the spy already been there and what happened they stormed across the river and drove him plum back up into the state and that boy was shot an hour later not because he if they didn't have no objection to him thinking about it they didn't it wasn't what he'd done it was the things he didn't do he didn't stand to his post of duty he didn't guard the post like he was supposed to and he sparked the whole thing not responsible tonight lays up the life tavern open other tabernacles and churches in shreveport louisiana god is sheriff take it with a storm it ain't what you're doing there is what you're failing to do let's do something about it let's dig with all of our hearts that when that day of judgment comes we can say god i did the very best i could and you know i did it amen we do all we can do that's always expected notice when they begin to dig they dug down against things just sorted out many big ditches the next morning the enemy looked down the sun come up and looked like blood they said well they fought among one another and killed each other and away they went in and they were ambushed and he said this is just the light thing before the lord sending forth his water and then went over into the other land and they stopped up everywhere else they cut out every good tree they just had our real old-fashioned revival and when it gets to the place that the people that love god will throw everything they got right into the revival with prayer and with everything else and seek god's faith and pray and and seek god and call out in the hours of night for mercy and get the neighbors saved and so forth i'll tell you we'll stop the mouth of every critic we'll knock down every horrible thing is standing up and they'll have to know that god's been in the camp that's right friends we'll never do it until that thing takes place we can that's so reliable for us saith the lord to the lion spoke in the name of the lord and the other night when i was coming over here a few nights ago and the lord met me in the room that justice vision is same as the sea at the platform other places said yes what's the matter with the church they've got so much selfishness everywhere didn't you say this the church of the living god has got so much differences and so much this and that so they breathe the holy spirit away from them and that's just exactly what it is and brother sister until we humble ourselves and become the lamb so the dove can light on us again and bring joy and peace and satisfaction and a burning desire in our hearts to see others saved and come to god we are simply fighting the winds that's all that is true no matter how many revivals the lord jesus was standing here at the platform last night and prove to every person present that he would absolutely raise from there let us shut it down tonight two or three hundred less people than we shared last night what's the matter the end time is your brother that's right it's here that's right we on any shadow down that same action and germany switzerland africa anywhere in the other land that same thing with her place there's been a hundred thousand people there that have been at least twenty or thirty thousand come to christ and the next night they've been double at that's right what is it the holy spirit has flew away from us and she's gone overseas hunting lambs to dwell in that's really exactly what's taking place what a time what a tragedy to see that we the more the church preaches the more the saints cry out it seems like the farther away from god the nation gets no wonder airplanes are crashing in the air boats are crashing on the sea the bible is said to be perplexed of time distress between the nations greatest times flying saucers through the air sights the heavens above and on earth below all these things taking place but the gospel would be preached and he said there would come a famine in the land not for bread and water but for the hearing of the word of god the true word of god a famine oh what a day that we're living in we ought to be ready make it ready now what are you speaking to brother brandon are you saying that to me i am saying that to you if you are unsafe if you have never received crowns if you don't know what it is to be filled with the holy spirit i'm speaking to you if you're a born again christian pray it up doing everything that you can just remember you can say hallelujah to him one night without preaching i thought i'd condemn sin in every way that i could condemn it in i combed it over and over until i wondered if a congregation ever come back and i don't mind sure that's covered everything god when i meet you there i can say i told him the truth and as i went away there's a lady a little flippy like walked up to me and she said well preacher you never struck me tonight that's one thing not one thing you said ever bothered me i'm above everything well i thought that lady was in pretty good shape she went flipping all the way like that struck him down long down i said well praise the lord i'm sure glad that she went on out some elderly ladies just tell her i said uh the universe said sure such as the biggest gospel there isn't you're so thinking about god there you are see oh my but remember brother no matter what it is what we'll see there is lay it aside if i haven't struck it may the holy spirit strike it to your heart tonight maybe it's unbelief maybe it's doubt you may be skeptic if it is make god lay it to your heart and we have an old-fashioned revival coming up this coming week may the lord grant it as we've got our heads go ask the little sister she'll come to this piano at oregon whatever and give us just a card if you will since you're there while i ask for this altar call now it's early yet tonight and i want to know as you have your heads down i offer this word of prayer for everyone i heavenly father harshly have i condemned sin and ever a way to call my mind i'll let it go through this microphone everything that i thought of but you put my mind i set it right out it might have offended some but at the day of the judgment i can say i'm innocent i preached the word just as you gave it yes and now there's no doubt there's just many fine loving people sitting here prayed up filled with the holy spirit no condemnation in their heart living daily before the lord if he should call them they be ready to go but to do my part to preach the gospel they'll call the colors of the gospel to show what christ died for what it is when it comes to us then lord jesus said there's somebody sitting here under condemnation you're the judge the word is gone forth it's the judge and you are the word now the father is someone who is living just right and though that you would send jesus to the earth tonight they've been condemned and loved and i think it's strange he's hanging out with his tent in hot weather to preach the old fashioned rough sin killing stirring no no gloves on handling it bare-handed laying it right out where it belongs lord my heart is open [Music] lord my heart [Music] lord my heart is [Music] i've opened [Music] come inside [Music] lord my heart is [Music] i opened come inside [Music] sometimes i think it's good to hear a message like that to check ourselves closely sometimes we can just get caught up with emotions and we're doing all right everything's good but just to check closely lord is everything all right is everything okay between me and you [Music] it's life gets busy things go on next thing you know the day's gone by and i didn't have much time to even talk to the lord today but without him where would we be today without you know even this morning as i was driving up got ready to go to work i just said lord let my mind and my heart just stay on you as much as possible during the day i know where it gets busy and you got to concentrate on work but just as quick as you can hate lord you know i just want to stay that way i just it's it's easy to get caught up on everything else that's going around even brother branham says not all of it is wrong but you get caught up in it before you know it you haven't even talked to the lord but lord keep my heart let my heart be open and let you dwell inside and let you come and and you know you you make the valley full of ditches in your life because god said if you'll you'll allow when you do it i will pour out i will give how much of god in you is in you well how much have you let of god be in you and there it is because brother green always reminded of god wants to give you the holy ghost more than you even want and you say lord i want it make room for it let's pray lord we sometimes we say lord we're way beyond that where we we need the deeper mysteries we need the greater revelations but sometimes we just need to be reminded make sure that our steps and our footing is grounded lord in your presence in the holy spirit lord in your word father so that we're anchored in the time of trouble in a day like we've never seen before and that we're anchored and we know that our anchor holds lord because we're grounded in you lord father may we take this word and apply it to our own lives each one of us lord shame lord make me more like you and lord as as we just let you have preeminence in our lives lord do the things that please you lord and we'll find that we'll find lord we'd think well i'm not going to be able no you're going to lose a desire to do those things rather that that occupy so much your time and you would find yourself serving the lord and just having a closer relationship lord let it be that way for all of us lord as we've heard your word today lord in jesus name amen one more time the lord my heart is open lord my heart is [Music] me [Music] every door [Music] i feel the pool [Music] me to give my love [Music] and i agree please i

with your son are you happy with your daughter god bless you tonight trust that something would just anchor deep and make preparation for god's blessings saying lord i know you said so so i'll make that preparation and prayer and the different things that we do living a life worthy of the gospel that's what it is so amen even as brother peter had to sing this world's not my homie so i get get along fine with my neighbors and it's good to have i'm glad i have good neighbors but it's more than that living a life worthy of the gospel they can draw from the water that you can give to so god bless you as you go and again tomorrow night friday night and saturday from 6 to eight the church will be open for prayer so come as you can come time to spend some time in prayer seeking the lord so
