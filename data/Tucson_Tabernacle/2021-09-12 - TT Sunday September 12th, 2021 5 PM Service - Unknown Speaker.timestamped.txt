[45:16] that when we leave lord we be better
[45:19] servants
[45:21] more in love with you lord
[45:25] a fire burning in our heart and a love
[45:27] affair that's
[45:29] stirred with you
[45:31] your word and
[45:33] something that would cause us to be
[45:38] a value
[45:42] up and doing lord
[45:45] perhaps
[45:47] some
[45:48] troubled soul we could be a hell
[45:52] lead them to you lord
[45:54] we want to commit the service this
[45:56] evening into your hands lord
[45:58] your word and we reverently approach it
[46:01] and ask you to
[46:04] bring
[46:05] to us the things that you'd have for us
[46:08] tonight lord we ask it in jesus name
[46:12] amen amen god bless you tonight i'd like
[46:14] to read a very
[46:16] familiar scripture i trust that it's not
[46:21] too
[46:22] redundant for you and it's found in
[46:27] the book of
[46:30] matthew in the 16th chapter and the
[46:32] eighth verse
[46:36] and
[46:38] it's a very
[46:41] well-known
[46:43] dialogue between
[46:47] jesus and
[46:49] that's why
[46:50] many people don't
[46:52] turn in their
[46:53] bibles these days is the scriptures are
[46:55] up there and i just
[46:58] wanted to see what was on the screen to
[47:00] see if it was if it was already on there
[47:05] matthew the 16th chapter and the 13th
[47:08] verse
[47:12] when jesus came into the coast of
[47:14] caesarea of
[47:15] philippi he asked the disciples saying
[47:20] who do men say
[47:22] that i the son of man am
[47:28] and they said some say that thou art
[47:30] john the baptist
[47:32] some elijah and others jeremiah
[47:35] or one of the prophets
[47:37] and he said unto them but whom say ye
[47:41] that i am
[47:44] and simon peter answered and said thou
[47:46] art the christ the son
[47:49] of the living god.
[47:54] and jesus answered and said unto him
[47:56] blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh
[48:00] and blood hath not revealed this unto
[48:02] thee
[48:03] but my father which is in heaven
[48:07] and i say also unto thee that thou art
[48:10] peter
[48:12] or petros a little rock
[48:15] and upon this rock i will build my
[48:18] church and the gates of hell
[48:20] shall not
[48:22] prevail
[48:25] against it
[48:27] may the lord bless his word
[48:29] you may be seated
[48:35] if the lord helped us tonight i had a
[48:37] little thought
[48:38] on my heart that came to me while i was
[48:40] working and
[48:44] that is a stand alone testimony
[48:55] man
[48:56] is a is a social creature and god made
[49:00] us that way too
[49:02] no man is an island we
[49:04] we need each other and
[49:07] uh
[49:07] paul in his letters to the church he
[49:10] always
[49:12] admonished to have
[49:14] uh
[49:16] a burden for others and to be part of a
[49:20] body
[49:21] and uh
[49:23] he gave many instructions of
[49:25] of how to handle our lives with
[49:29] one another and and uh
[49:33] knowing that we would be
[49:35] uh
[49:37] his family in the lord and and
[49:40] so
[49:41] we read this morning how
[49:43] brother branham said each person
[49:45] receives the holy spirit
[49:49] and
[49:50] every person seeks out their own
[49:53] salvation with
[49:55] fear
[49:56] and trembling and then each person
[49:59] brings
[50:00] their experience with the lord and their
[50:06] surrendering to the lord and and being
[50:08] baptized into the body by his spirit
[50:12] which is the new birth
[50:16] and
[50:18] then collectively we become the body of
[50:22] christ and
[50:24] so
[50:25] peter in this scripture which we're all
[50:28] very familiar with he
[50:32] the lord is
[50:33] isolating
[50:37] the disciples and saying you know it's
[50:40] one thing to kind of make a general
[50:42] statement of who does man say that i am
[50:45] but now
[50:47] what is your revelation or
[50:50] you know speak from your own heart
[50:55] and
[50:58] so when peter spoke
[51:01] it it seems like a little contradiction
[51:03] in scripture here because jesus said who
[51:05] do men say that i
[51:07] the son of man him
[51:10] and then when peter gave his answer he
[51:12] said thou art the son of god
[51:16] and
[51:18] he said to peter he said flesh and blood
[51:21] hath not revealed this unto thee in
[51:24] other words
[51:27] your brain
[51:29] your intellect didn't
[51:32] give you
[51:34] this
[51:34] understanding
[51:36] nor
[51:37] did other flesh and blood and some other
[51:40] teacher
[51:41] or or
[51:43] some
[51:44] bible school or or some
[51:48] learned man or theologian
[51:51] that's not how you got that peter
[51:54] but god
[51:57] because he is god and because he can
[52:00] quicken his word
[52:02] to us he said to peter he said god gave
[52:06] you
[52:07] that revelation
[52:09] and it's a wonderful thing when
[52:12] when you have a revelation
[52:16] it you know
[52:19] it's been something
[52:21] that's been made real
[52:24] to you
[52:25] so brother branham said that
[52:29] the atonement
[52:31] he said everything hinges
[52:33] on your attitude toward
[52:36] the atonement
[52:39] and i think we've spoken here before and
[52:41] i don't mean to tire you but
[52:43] i had been very surprised in preaching
[52:46] around the country
[52:48] how how very little many believers know
[52:52] about
[52:53] what the word atonement
[52:55] means
[52:57] it's very beautiful to
[52:59] if you want to
[53:02] see something that's edifying i
[53:05] saw a little piece about the bible it's
[53:08] on youtube it's called the battle of the
[53:10] bible
[53:11] and it talks about the english
[53:13] translation of the bible
[53:17] and it gives such
[53:23] a portrayal of the price that was paid
[53:27] for us to have the bible
[53:30] in english
[53:32] and that these men gave their lives and
[53:34] they suffered and they they
[53:37] they
[53:42] paid the ultimate price they they gave
[53:44] everything
[53:46] that we could read this
[53:49] in our in our language and how often we
[53:52] we just take it
[53:54] uh
[53:56] for granted but
[53:58] that word atonement
[54:01] means
[54:03] at
[54:04] one meant
[54:06] and it's a word that came into being at
[54:08] the uh
[54:11] translation of the bible it's the when
[54:14] god and man become one and
[54:18] we know that in the old testament that
[54:20] there were many sacrifices that were
[54:22] made during the year
[54:25] but
[54:26] first sin offerings and
[54:28] thanksgiving offerings and
[54:30] different
[54:32] sacrifices made
[54:35] but one day
[54:38] and only one day in the year the high
[54:41] priest
[54:42] went behind the veil took the blood
[54:46] of
[54:47] the sacrifices and went
[54:50] behind
[54:51] the veil
[54:53] and that was the day
[54:56] of atonement so all of these other
[54:59] sacrifices and things were just
[55:01] temporarily temporary
[55:04] until that day
[55:07] and and that's something that you can
[55:09] find in uh the book of hebrews i believe
[55:12] that's the ninth chapter brother branham
[55:15] i mean brother paul
[55:17] explains
[55:19] these
[55:22] stages that the priest would do this
[55:25] here in this part of the temple but only
[55:27] on that day
[55:29] would the priest enter the holiest of
[55:31] holies
[55:32] and that was all a picture
[55:36] of christ going
[55:39] in behind the veil for us
[55:42] and offering the ultimate
[55:45] sacrifice so
[55:47] that
[55:49] day
[55:50] of atonement
[55:52] was
[55:56] in reality what paul was bringing us to
[55:59] was
[56:00] that jesus offered himself
[56:04] as a sacrifice he was the ultimate
[56:07] sacrifice and he wasn't just bringing
[56:09] the blood of a of a sacrifice but he was
[56:12] bringing his own blood he was
[56:14] sacrificing his own life he was giving
[56:17] himself to be that once and for all
[56:21] sacrifice
[56:22] and now that
[56:24] is
[56:25] the atonement
[56:28] so that's the true day of atonement
[56:33] for the believer
[56:34] when you accept that atonement for your
[56:38] sins
[56:40] that's the
[56:41] answer to the sin question does the sin
[56:44] question go away
[56:46] no
[56:47] the sin question always badgers you you
[56:50] know if you love god why did you do that
[56:54] if you believe why did you do something
[56:57] contrary to your testimony and and
[57:01] the bible says that satan is an accuser
[57:04] of the brethren he accuses
[57:06] the the brethren night and day before
[57:09] the father so it's a nonstop
[57:12] that's why you can wake up in the middle
[57:14] of the night and feel afraid
[57:16] and feel like you're in trouble and then
[57:18] you've got to say no no lord
[57:21] i'm under your wing
[57:23] i'm trusting in you that you've made the
[57:26] atonement for me
[57:29] whatever it is that's troubling me
[57:32] it's it's under your care because
[57:36] you made that sacrifice one time for me
[57:39] i'm resting in the atonement
[57:44] now
[57:45] the statement that
[57:47] brother branham made
[57:52] was
[57:52] that it's your attitude
[57:56] toward the atonement that brings the
[57:59] blessing to you
[58:02] so
[58:05] you can
[58:08] god can make this atonement but until
[58:11] you embrace it
[58:14] and make it yours
[58:16] it's not going to do you any good
[58:21] now
[58:26] this was
[58:29] the challenge that
[58:32] jesus was putting to peter said who do
[58:35] you say
[58:39] that i am and he called
[58:42] peter a little stone
[58:45] and the church world put the two
[58:47] together and said okay stone
[58:51] building upon this stone i'll build my
[58:53] church and they had their interpretation
[58:56] of the word
[58:58] but brother brown said no he didn't
[59:00] build the church on peter
[59:03] just because he called him a little
[59:05] stone and he said
[59:06] he said upon this rock i'll build my
[59:09] church
[59:11] what
[59:12] jesus was referring to was the
[59:14] revelation
[59:16] of who jesus is
[59:18] in other words peter took
[59:20] that
[59:23] that god had given him he said thou art
[59:26] the christ you're the messiah you are
[59:29] that one that all the prophets and sages
[59:32] and that we've all looked for that
[59:35] emmanuel would come would be god with us
[59:38] we believe that you are
[59:41] that one and
[59:43] jesus said
[59:45] that didn't come out of your intellect
[59:48] that came from god
[59:51] and
[59:52] upon that revelation
[59:54] of who i am when that becomes real to
[59:57] you
[59:59] then that's what god builds his church
[1:00:01] on is when you have a revelation of what
[1:00:05] jesus is to you
[1:00:08] then all hail hell will try to fight
[1:00:11] that but it's real to you
[1:00:15] and it's just
[1:00:16] astounding to me
[1:00:18] how that so often
[1:00:20] phrases
[1:00:23] are so common
[1:00:25] and at the same time so foreign
[1:00:28] in to people
[1:00:30] so often heard
[1:00:32] but
[1:00:34] when the individual hears it they they
[1:00:36] have a little
[1:00:38] question in their mind like
[1:00:41] what is that
[1:00:42] and and maybe this is
[1:00:45] elementary to you
[1:00:47] but
[1:00:49] my children often say when i explained
[1:00:51] things they said yeah dad we got it we
[1:00:53] got it you know you don't need to go on
[1:00:55] we got it
[1:01:01] one of my sons in a building project i i
[1:01:04] i knew that that that's the
[1:01:06] predominating uh theme is that we got
[1:01:09] this dad
[1:01:10] so i just said uh
[1:01:12] um
[1:01:13] well did you want to entertain any
[1:01:15] questions can i could i ask a few things
[1:01:18] have you considered this you know can i
[1:01:20] can i just ask you a couple questions on
[1:01:22] this project if
[1:01:24] you know just for my own comfort
[1:01:26] he said no
[1:01:30] yeah i got it
[1:01:36] so but even the word revelation
[1:01:42] sometimes people think it's very
[1:01:44] supernatural but it's when god
[1:01:47] makes something
[1:01:48] real
[1:01:49] to you
[1:01:52] you know get a flat tire out in the
[1:01:54] middle of nowhere
[1:01:56] and go to the trunk to see
[1:01:59] you know what condition your spare is in
[1:02:01] and you might get a very sad revelation
[1:02:05] you know you thought yeah i believe in
[1:02:07] spares right
[1:02:08] okay well a flat one
[1:02:11] isn't really a spare
[1:02:14] so then by that experience this becomes
[1:02:16] a revelation to you that hey if i'm
[1:02:19] going on this big trip
[1:02:21] check the tire
[1:02:25] and it just becomes real to you
[1:02:28] and and
[1:02:29] that that seems like a very simplistic
[1:02:32] uh
[1:02:33] ideology or or something to say
[1:02:37] but it goes very much along with
[1:02:40] how simple
[1:02:41] this thought when i was
[1:02:44] doing some landscaping which i normally
[1:02:46] don't do and
[1:02:47] building some rock
[1:02:49] what they call rip-rap
[1:02:51] rock walls where you just take
[1:02:53] stones by hand and you stack them up and
[1:02:55] you make a wall
[1:02:57] to retain
[1:02:59] when a landscape changes
[1:03:01] elevations and so
[1:03:04] if you get to doing this and then
[1:03:06] also
[1:03:08] if your
[1:03:12] landscape needs to look good this wall
[1:03:14] needs to look
[1:03:17] like it's permanent and it needs to be
[1:03:19] somehow kind of appealing to the eye
[1:03:22] while you're building there's things
[1:03:24] going through your mind and you're
[1:03:26] picking up these rocks and you're saying
[1:03:28] okay this rock is going to bridge
[1:03:30] between these two rocks and this rock
[1:03:32] will be a good stop st stacker to to
[1:03:35] lift my height and and and and
[1:03:38] you know somebody would think you're
[1:03:40] crazy but you start
[1:03:42] picking up every rock and this each rock
[1:03:45] has a certain kind of characteristic and
[1:03:48] you pick up one and you say no you're
[1:03:50] not that kind of rock and and you put
[1:03:54] another one
[1:03:59] and then you get your
[1:04:01] wall built and now
[1:04:04] your
[1:04:05] artistry has to come to a place where
[1:04:08] there's going to be one large-sized rock
[1:04:11] or a pair of them or three that is
[1:04:13] exposed because they're only there
[1:04:17] now you've accomplished your retention
[1:04:18] you you've done what you had but now
[1:04:20] this needs to look nice
[1:04:23] and maybe you'll have one place where
[1:04:25] you'll just put one rock
[1:04:28] and that has to be a stand-alone rock
[1:04:34] and you think a stand-alone rock what
[1:04:37] what would a stand-alone rock be well a
[1:04:40] standalone rock is big enough
[1:04:43] that it looks substantial
[1:04:47] but small enough that you don't
[1:04:49] get a hernia moving it
[1:04:53] and it has to have some kind of a
[1:04:55] characteristic some interest
[1:04:57] that it doesn't just look like a common
[1:05:00] boulder and it in it and it has to look
[1:05:02] like it belongs there and you set the
[1:05:05] rock there
[1:05:06] and you say now that's
[1:05:08] a standalone rock
[1:05:11] that's finished that rock itself because
[1:05:14] of what it is
[1:05:17] it doesn't need another rock to go with
[1:05:20] it
[1:05:21] it doesn't need other rocks to support
[1:05:23] it it it's not
[1:05:25] leaning against the others or you know
[1:05:28] it's not one of those rocks that you
[1:05:30] keyed into a certain hole it's just a
[1:05:32] stand-alone rock
[1:05:35] and
[1:05:36] you would say well brother dennis you're
[1:05:38] really stretching this
[1:05:43] but i thought what about a standalone
[1:05:46] testimony
[1:05:48] you know many times as social creatures
[1:05:50] we're always trying to figure out where
[1:05:52] we fit
[1:05:54] you know
[1:05:55] what's my place in this and
[1:05:58] they're like this and i'm here and
[1:06:00] what's my relationship here and you were
[1:06:03] always trying to you know
[1:06:05] figure out our place but
[1:06:08] do you have
[1:06:09] a standalone testimony where you're
[1:06:12] taken out of the church
[1:06:15] out of the family
[1:06:17] out of your marriage i'm not advocating
[1:06:20] to take anybody out of their marriage
[1:06:22] but but
[1:06:23] let's take you as a believer
[1:06:28] out
[1:06:29] of your unit do you have a standalone
[1:06:33] testimony
[1:06:34] who are you and what is your
[1:06:38] testimony if if you just the man on the
[1:06:41] street doesn't know who you're related
[1:06:42] to what your last name is where you go
[1:06:45] to church what you believe if you
[1:06:47] believe the message of the hour that
[1:06:48] you're a christian that you're
[1:06:50] uh all of these things but when they get
[1:06:53] to talking to you and say who are you
[1:06:56] you say well this is what i'm about this
[1:06:59] is the
[1:07:00] real me this is what i'm living for this
[1:07:03] is what makes
[1:07:05] me
[1:07:06] tick
[1:07:09] and
[1:07:13] jesus demanded that of peter
[1:07:17] of of what's going on inside of you
[1:07:20] peter
[1:07:25] and there's an
[1:07:26] interesting scripture in
[1:07:30] hebrews 9
[1:07:33] where paul talks about the
[1:07:37] death
[1:07:39] of the testator
[1:07:42] you ever heard that expression or how
[1:07:43] many here would say i've heard that
[1:07:46] expression in hebrews
[1:07:52] it's in hebrews 9 and
[1:08:01] paul is rehearsing with the believers
[1:08:03] how that
[1:08:05] there was always
[1:08:07] with remission of sins with the taking
[1:08:10] away of sin with the forgiveness of sin
[1:08:13] there was always blood associated
[1:08:16] and
[1:08:17] the first time that god's children in
[1:08:20] the garden sinned
[1:08:22] god
[1:08:23] gave them skins now
[1:08:26] adam and eve made
[1:08:28] aprons of fig leaves
[1:08:30] because their transgression and their
[1:08:33] sin made them know that they were naked
[1:08:36] so they took fig leaves and they tried
[1:08:38] to cover themselves and that's what
[1:08:40] religion is as a covering
[1:08:43] but god
[1:08:46] didn't accept that and he gave them
[1:08:48] skins
[1:08:50] which signified that
[1:08:52] something had died that
[1:08:54] there had been the shedding of blood and
[1:08:57] all through the old testament when there
[1:08:59] was remission of sins there was always
[1:09:01] the shedding of blood an innocent lamb
[1:09:04] or moloch
[1:09:07] was the sacrifice
[1:09:10] for sin
[1:09:12] so that was a
[1:09:17] commonly
[1:09:18] understood concept but
[1:09:22] now
[1:09:23] paul is introducing that
[1:09:26] it's not a bull
[1:09:28] or an animal
[1:09:30] but it was god coming down and
[1:09:34] tabernacling in flesh
[1:09:38] to become
[1:09:40] the sacrifice that would be made
[1:09:43] once and for all
[1:09:45] and he says in
[1:09:47] hebrews 9 and 13 for if the blood of
[1:09:50] bulls and goats
[1:09:52] and the ashes of an heifer sprinkled the
[1:09:54] unclean
[1:09:55] sanctify
[1:09:56] to the purifying of the flesh
[1:09:59] how much
[1:10:00] more
[1:10:02] shall the blood of christ
[1:10:05] who through the eternal spirit offered
[1:10:08] himself without spot
[1:10:11] to god
[1:10:13] purge your conscience from dead works to
[1:10:16] serve
[1:10:17] the living god
[1:10:21] very interesting this word dead works
[1:10:24] because
[1:10:25] paul in another place
[1:10:29] he talks about all of these sacrifices
[1:10:33] that could never make you clean
[1:10:37] now dead works
[1:10:40] are things outside
[1:10:43] of this sacrifice
[1:10:45] that men try to do to make themselves
[1:10:48] clean
[1:10:49] or to make themselves worthy or to make
[1:10:52] themselves holy and man can do nothing
[1:10:57] brother abraham said the the thief on
[1:10:59] the cross
[1:11:02] was god showing
[1:11:04] that when jesus said today you'll be
[1:11:07] with me in paradise was to to show
[1:11:10] that there was nothing
[1:11:13] that man could do not one work that you
[1:11:16] can do
[1:11:19] to merit your salvation or to make
[1:11:22] yourself cleaner
[1:11:23] or more holy
[1:11:25] our holiness comes from being in christ
[1:11:29] and from accepting the sacrifice that he
[1:11:32] made
[1:11:36] and so
[1:11:39] any
[1:11:40] other things are dead works there
[1:11:43] there's no life in that
[1:11:50] and for this cause
[1:11:52] he is the mediator of the new testament
[1:11:54] that
[1:11:55] by means of death
[1:11:57] for the redemption of the transgressions
[1:12:01] that were under the first testament
[1:12:04] oh my how much the intellect likes to
[1:12:08] stay under the first testament
[1:12:12] because the first testament
[1:12:14] is like these scales
[1:12:17] you know and it's weighing everything
[1:12:19] and it says i i lived next to a
[1:12:21] man and this is actually
[1:12:23] their doctrine
[1:12:25] is that you did good so put the good
[1:12:27] that you did over here and the bad that
[1:12:29] you did over here
[1:12:31] and you kind of weigh that out
[1:12:34] and it's all kind of a judgment thing
[1:12:36] and put everything on the scale now how
[1:12:39] many people do that to themselves
[1:12:42] in their own mind before god and they
[1:12:44] say well lord
[1:12:45] you know
[1:12:47] i fell down and i you know my thoughts
[1:12:49] went south and i didn't do right and i
[1:12:52] lost my temper and it's gone over here
[1:12:55] you know they said yeah but
[1:12:57] i read my bible and i prayed and i
[1:13:00] repented and and i've been trying to do
[1:13:02] better lord and you know it's always
[1:13:04] this kind of a thing self analysis self
[1:13:07] justice self this
[1:13:10] it's
[1:13:12] that's the first testimony
[1:13:14] that's the first testament
[1:13:17] you know that's the commandments do
[1:13:20] these commandments and you shall live
[1:13:23] and don't do them and and and you're
[1:13:25] going to have the wrath of god
[1:13:28] and it's just
[1:13:31] a law
[1:13:32] you know more over here
[1:13:35] and less over here the scales are going
[1:13:36] to do that there's just this law
[1:13:42] but when jesus came
[1:13:46] he brought
[1:13:47] a new testament and said i'm going to
[1:13:50] make a sacrifice once and for all we're
[1:13:52] not going there anymore
[1:13:55] i'm going to settle the sin question
[1:13:58] i'm going to forgive your iniquities and
[1:14:00] i'm going to make an attorney and i'm
[1:14:02] going to satisfy that law
[1:14:07] once and for all
[1:14:10] and then i'm going to make a new
[1:14:12] testament
[1:14:14] i'm going to show you a new and living
[1:14:17] way a different way of life that is not
[1:14:20] this
[1:14:23] but that is resting
[1:14:27] secured
[1:14:28] in christ
[1:14:30] the mark of a mature christian is rest
[1:14:35] and all of this in hebrews earlier in
[1:14:38] the chapters and i'm sorry to be so
[1:14:40] stuck on hebrews you forgive me it's
[1:14:42] just been where i
[1:14:44] where i've been lately because we're in
[1:14:46] a little bible study about it
[1:14:48] but
[1:14:49] if you look earlier in in hebrews
[1:14:53] paul's saying why didn't they enter into
[1:14:56] the promised land why did all that
[1:14:58] generation die in the wilderness
[1:15:01] because they
[1:15:03] couldn't enter in because of unbelief
[1:15:05] and he's talking about physically the
[1:15:07] promised land that moses brought them
[1:15:09] through the red sea they they went
[1:15:11] through the wilderness and they got
[1:15:13] ready to come into the promised land and
[1:15:16] somebody raised up and says well we're
[1:15:17] like grasshoppers in their sights
[1:15:19] there's giants we can't do it and they
[1:15:21] wouldn't enter in
[1:15:23] because why they they didn't have faith
[1:15:25] they didn't believe the word of god god
[1:15:28] promised that i'm going to be full i'm
[1:15:29] going to go before you
[1:15:31] and you're going to take the land and
[1:15:33] where your steps
[1:15:35] trod you're going to possess that
[1:15:42] and they didn't believe and paul said
[1:15:43] they couldn't enter in because of
[1:15:45] unbelief
[1:15:48] and now paul is speaking of not a
[1:15:51] natural land
[1:15:53] because he said when you come into this
[1:15:55] land you're not going to be slaves
[1:15:56] anymore you're not going to be beaten
[1:15:59] down and
[1:16:00] but you are going to have your own land
[1:16:02] you're going to grow your own fruit
[1:16:03] trees you're go you're going to possess
[1:16:05] it yourself and you're going to have
[1:16:07] rest in this land from your enemies all
[1:16:10] around you and from the tyranny of egypt
[1:16:12] and this will be a land of rest for you
[1:16:14] that was just a natural type
[1:16:18] of the spiritual type of when
[1:16:20] jesus came and made the atonement for
[1:16:23] sin
[1:16:25] if you can
[1:16:27] receive it
[1:16:28] if you can believe it if
[1:16:31] if if
[1:16:32] if you can
[1:16:34] take it to yourself as your own
[1:16:38] your attitude toward the atonement
[1:16:41] it brings you into
[1:16:44] this rest
[1:16:45] because jesus is our sabbath
[1:16:49] and our resting place
[1:16:54] and how do you enter in there by faith
[1:16:57] in that atonement you enter into that
[1:16:59] rest that it's not
[1:17:01] based on my works anymore
[1:17:04] it's not even based in what i can
[1:17:06] understand in the message of the hour
[1:17:14] it's based on me resting
[1:17:17] in christ he is my sabbath i have a
[1:17:20] precious man i met on vacation he's
[1:17:23] seventh day adventist and you know
[1:17:24] they're just so stuck on that saturday
[1:17:26] is that's the mark of the beast you know
[1:17:29] is those that
[1:17:31] keep the sabbath
[1:17:32] and those who don't that's going to
[1:17:34] separate them and there's you know old
[1:17:36] testament scriptures and things in
[1:17:38] revelation that
[1:17:40] but christ
[1:17:42] is our sabbath it's not a day
[1:17:44] it's not sunday
[1:17:47] and it's not saturday
[1:17:49] it's being in christ that's our
[1:17:52] sabbath
[1:17:54] remember how brother branham said in the
[1:17:56] church age book it's so beautiful i have
[1:17:58] loved
[1:18:00] the church age book for so many years
[1:18:02] just such a
[1:18:03] beautiful thing that god afforded for us
[1:18:09] and he says
[1:18:11] john says when he went on the isle of
[1:18:13] patmos he said i was in the spirit
[1:18:16] on the lord's day
[1:18:19] and brother brown begins to talk about
[1:18:20] the lord's day
[1:18:22] and he said
[1:18:26] that wasn't sunday
[1:18:28] and it wasn't saturday the day of the
[1:18:31] lord he said this is man's day they do
[1:18:34] whatever they want with the word of god
[1:18:38] they they mishandle it they they do
[1:18:40] whatever but
[1:18:42] when the day of the lord is when when
[1:18:45] when he shall come and bring his reign
[1:18:49] when he comes and brings judgment when
[1:18:51] he comes
[1:18:53] as not as savior anymore but as judged
[1:18:57] as the wigged one
[1:19:02] that's
[1:19:03] the day of the lord and and so
[1:19:06] when
[1:19:09] john on the isle of patamos the lord was
[1:19:12] going to show him things that are to be
[1:19:14] you know
[1:19:15] he's he's
[1:19:17] taking john
[1:19:19] and showing him in symbol form
[1:19:22] the program of god and he's also showing
[1:19:25] them the future
[1:19:26] the church the seven church ages and and
[1:19:29] all of these things the things that
[1:19:31] transpire on earth the things in the
[1:19:33] heavens and
[1:19:34] and
[1:19:35] so john
[1:19:37] was
[1:19:38] in the spirit on the lord's day the day
[1:19:41] of the lord
[1:19:44] so
[1:19:48] a believer
[1:19:51] has to come to this place of rest
[1:19:56] and but
[1:19:57] for your testimony
[1:20:00] to have power
[1:20:03] paul's here in the 15th verse and he's
[1:20:05] saying
[1:20:06] and for this cause he is the mediator of
[1:20:09] the new testament
[1:20:10] that by means of death for the
[1:20:13] redemption of the transgressions that
[1:20:15] were under the first testimony
[1:20:17] they which are called might receive the
[1:20:19] promise
[1:20:21] of eternal
[1:20:22] inheritance
[1:20:28] verse 16 for where a testament is there
[1:20:32] must also of necessity be the death of
[1:20:36] the testator
[1:20:38] for a testament
[1:20:40] is of
[1:20:42] force after men are dead otherwise it is
[1:20:45] of no strength at all while the testator
[1:20:49] liveth
[1:20:50] now did that seem a little heavy to some
[1:20:53] of you
[1:20:56] let's
[1:20:56] go back
[1:21:00] a testament is now
[1:21:04] when you
[1:21:05] die many people will have a will a last
[1:21:09] testament
[1:21:11] a will
[1:21:18] now
[1:21:20] if my mother gave me
[1:21:22] all her earthly possessions i have
[1:21:26] four siblings
[1:21:30] in this will
[1:21:33] and then i said okay i got this will i
[1:21:35] get it all
[1:21:38] and i go to
[1:21:40] enforce that and my mother's still alive
[1:21:44] she's gonna say wait a minute
[1:21:47] now
[1:21:51] i can't enforce
[1:21:53] that testimony even if it was it's not
[1:21:56] that way but
[1:22:00] i can't enforce that while my mother's
[1:22:02] alive because while she's alive and has
[1:22:05] her right mind she can change that
[1:22:07] anytime
[1:22:09] and she can also spend it all up
[1:22:12] if she should show choose
[1:22:15] okay because it's hers
[1:22:17] i'm not going to say well you know i got
[1:22:19] this
[1:22:20] you said in the will
[1:22:22] you know
[1:22:23] you can't spend no more money mom i you
[1:22:25] know i'm in your will
[1:22:27] no that
[1:22:30] that last will and testament is of no
[1:22:32] force at all while the testator
[1:22:35] the the one who made it
[1:22:38] is alive
[1:22:42] for a testament so
[1:22:45] where there is now this is paul speaking
[1:22:48] about jesus
[1:22:50] and he's saying where a testament is
[1:22:52] there must also of necessity be the
[1:22:55] death of the testator
[1:22:58] for a testament is of force after men
[1:23:00] are dead otherwise it is of no strength
[1:23:03] at all while the testator liveth
[1:23:07] whereupon neither the first testament
[1:23:09] was dedicated without blood
[1:23:13] and he goes on to say now jesus had to
[1:23:17] die to purchase this
[1:23:19] inheritance for us
[1:23:22] and to give us this testament
[1:23:24] but as i read this scripture i thought
[1:23:26] how true that is your testimony
[1:23:30] is really of no power
[1:23:33] while
[1:23:34] you live
[1:23:36] if you're just
[1:23:38] defending your rights
[1:23:39] living for yourself
[1:23:41] trying to figure out how you can get
[1:23:43] ahead in life how life can be more
[1:23:46] comfortable for you aren't you just
[1:23:49] doing what every human being is doing on
[1:23:52] earth
[1:23:53] aren't we all just trying to live a
[1:23:55] little better
[1:23:57] you know
[1:23:58] maybe trying to
[1:24:00] have a little more income and a little
[1:24:01] less work
[1:24:03] or just try to get things situated so
[1:24:06] you can be comfortable
[1:24:10] but christianity
[1:24:12] calls for a death to self a self
[1:24:16] sacrificial life that you have a purpose
[1:24:19] that doesn't center around you
[1:24:23] it centers around the will of god and
[1:24:26] your brother and sister and your fellow
[1:24:29] man
[1:24:30] it's it's a self-sacrificial
[1:24:33] life it requires for your testimony to
[1:24:38] have power
[1:24:41] it requires the death of the testator
[1:24:47] it requires that you're
[1:24:50] a man or a woman that is dead to south
[1:24:55] that they could see
[1:24:56] the life of christ in you there's a
[1:24:59] beautiful thing on the mount
[1:25:01] in
[1:25:02] i believe it's luke 9 and 31
[1:25:10] i'll try to go there quickly
[1:25:13] on mount transfiguration
[1:25:19] when peter james and john's went up on
[1:25:21] the mount and
[1:25:26] and behold there talked with him two men
[1:25:28] which were moses and elijah's
[1:25:31] elias
[1:25:33] who appeared in glory and spake
[1:25:36] of the decease
[1:25:38] which he should accomplish
[1:25:40] at jerusalem
[1:25:43] the decease that he would accomplish it
[1:25:46] doesn't seem like much of an
[1:25:47] accomplishment to die
[1:25:50] if a person died in an accident or or
[1:25:55] you know died of an illness or something
[1:25:57] we would think of that as a defeat a
[1:26:00] tragic event
[1:26:03] but
[1:26:04] when
[1:26:05] moses and elijah talked about
[1:26:08] jesus's death
[1:26:12] at calvary
[1:26:14] they said his decease
[1:26:17] which he should
[1:26:19] accomplish
[1:26:20] and i think it's a great accomplishment
[1:26:22] for a believer
[1:26:27] to show
[1:26:29] the death
[1:26:31] of the testator and and the power of
[1:26:34] your testimony
[1:26:37] depends on that
[1:26:47] and i believe with all my heart as i get
[1:26:49] older
[1:26:50] i have a sense
[1:26:53] of urgency
[1:26:55] that concerns me
[1:26:59] about
[1:27:00] particularly
[1:27:02] young people
[1:27:04] who seem to be very
[1:27:06] self-centered
[1:27:08] and rob themselves
[1:27:11] of their own gratification
[1:27:15] because in the world that we're living
[1:27:17] in today
[1:27:19] uh i live in a college town and and
[1:27:22] you know when i'm out about working
[1:27:23] places many places are rented and
[1:27:25] they're rented by college students and
[1:27:27] you you you visit with
[1:27:30] some of these young people and they're
[1:27:33] very adventure orientated you know we we
[1:27:36] want to go everywhere and we want to
[1:27:38] kayak down a certain river in peru and
[1:27:41] we you know we want to we're we want to
[1:27:43] do these adventures
[1:27:46] and then you see that no
[1:27:48] they don't want to have they don't want
[1:27:50] to get married they don't want to have
[1:27:52] children they
[1:27:53] they don't uh
[1:27:56] they don't want commitment they don't
[1:27:58] want to enter into long-term commitments
[1:28:01] and there seems to be a very
[1:28:04] uh
[1:28:09] it doesn't seem there's much focus on a
[1:28:11] goal
[1:28:12] or a purpose
[1:28:14] other than to enjoy life
[1:28:24] and for a christian
[1:28:28] a christian is different
[1:28:31] a christian
[1:28:32] gives their heart
[1:28:34] and life
[1:28:36] to god
[1:28:40] and surrenders their life and
[1:28:43] and they are
[1:28:45] primarily concerned
[1:28:48] about their service to the lord jesus
[1:28:50] christ
[1:28:52] and then based on that
[1:28:54] they'll fit in the body they'll fit into
[1:28:57] life but they come to
[1:28:59] this surrender with the lord jesus that
[1:29:02] he
[1:29:03] will make a way
[1:29:05] he will provide he will provide a place
[1:29:09] in the body of christ in life in
[1:29:13] and and our security is in him it's not
[1:29:16] in our financial ability
[1:29:18] to
[1:29:19] you know play your cards right
[1:29:22] but we're resting in him and we're as we
[1:29:25] said this morning
[1:29:27] we are
[1:29:30] seeking first the kingdom of god
[1:29:34] and his righteousness
[1:29:37] and believing that all
[1:29:39] other things shall be
[1:29:41] added to us
[1:29:45] at 6 15 i had
[1:29:49] something on my heart also
[1:29:52] that's not exactly
[1:29:55] fit in the sermon but
[1:30:01] a standalone testimony
[1:30:03] also requires that
[1:30:05] you know
[1:30:07] where you stand
[1:30:09] and in your christian walk many times
[1:30:12] you'll get a challenge
[1:30:15] remember paul
[1:30:18] said in one of his reddit letters i
[1:30:20] marvel
[1:30:22] that you are so
[1:30:24] soon
[1:30:25] removed
[1:30:27] from your stand i can't quote it exactly
[1:30:31] if somebody's got it
[1:30:34] shout it out but
[1:30:36] he said i marvel
[1:30:38] that you're so soon
[1:30:39] removed
[1:30:41] from this
[1:30:42] standing in grace that you had
[1:30:45] that you're influenced by something else
[1:30:48] that pulls you away
[1:30:53] from your testimony
[1:31:02] i've experienced this in my life where
[1:31:05] as i've gone along and as a christian
[1:31:07] i've read my bible
[1:31:10] i'm not boasting about that i'm just
[1:31:12] saying hey
[1:31:13] i knew that how do you get more
[1:31:16] spiritual
[1:31:18] read your bible
[1:31:20] pray every day
[1:31:22] okay now a christian does that
[1:31:25] and
[1:31:26] by the grace of god i i understood that
[1:31:29] brother branham was sent of god
[1:31:34] to restore us back to the original
[1:31:36] truths of the bible
[1:31:39] and i understood revelations 10
[1:31:42] and 7 that
[1:31:44] all the mysteries
[1:31:47] would be made known at the sounding of
[1:31:49] this angel and i knew
[1:31:53] that this angel was one of the seven
[1:31:56] stars in the hand of jesus
[1:31:59] that it spoke about in the book of
[1:32:01] revelation this isn't going to be heavy
[1:32:03] so you don't have to you know tighten
[1:32:05] your seat belts it's going to be simple
[1:32:08] but i just understood
[1:32:11] about the church ages that there was
[1:32:13] these dispensations of time
[1:32:16] and that god sent us brother branham for
[1:32:19] our dispensation of time
[1:32:22] and not to bring something that wasn't
[1:32:24] in the bible
[1:32:26] but to bring us back into the word of
[1:32:29] god so we would understand
[1:32:32] the truth that had been so perverted
[1:32:35] by religion and just bring us back to
[1:32:38] the original word so we could get the
[1:32:40] true revelation and live by it
[1:32:45] how many remember when you first
[1:32:48] started to understand about
[1:32:50] predestination big word right
[1:32:53] when brother brown said it's such a big
[1:32:55] word usually out in the meetings i don't
[1:32:57] like to use it
[1:32:58] so i use foreknowledge
[1:33:01] that god to be god he had to foreknow
[1:33:05] he had to know that you would be here
[1:33:08] when you were born he knew what color
[1:33:10] hair you'd have what color eyes you'd
[1:33:12] have and then we have examples in
[1:33:14] scriptures and a very beautiful one is
[1:33:17] in
[1:33:20] isn't it the first chapter of jeremiah
[1:33:24] if we would go there
[1:33:27] and see if the preacher's right
[1:33:38] i'm sorry to make you wait
[1:33:53] now god doesn't have a different program
[1:33:55] all the time he's not always changing
[1:33:57] things up
[1:33:59] you know maybe you have a spouse like
[1:34:00] that but god's not like that
[1:34:09] jeremiah chapter 1 and verse 4
[1:34:13] then the word of the lord came unto me
[1:34:15] saying
[1:34:16] before i formed thee in the belly
[1:34:21] i knew thee
[1:34:26] and before thou camest forth out of the
[1:34:28] womb i sanctified thee
[1:34:31] and i ordained thee a prophet unto the
[1:34:34] nations
[1:34:38] then said i
[1:34:40] oh lord
[1:34:42] god behold i cannot speak for i am a
[1:34:45] child
[1:34:48] but the lord said unto me say not i am a
[1:34:50] child for thou shalt go to
[1:34:54] all that i shall send thee and
[1:34:56] whatsoever i command thee thou shalt
[1:34:59] speak
[1:35:01] be not afraid of their faces for i am
[1:35:04] with thee to deliver thee saith the lord
[1:35:10] then the lord put forth his hand and
[1:35:12] touched my mouth and the lord said unto
[1:35:14] me behold i have put my words in thy
[1:35:16] mouth
[1:35:17] see i have this day sent thee over the
[1:35:20] nations and over the kingdoms to root
[1:35:24] out and to pull down and to destroy and
[1:35:26] to throw down and to build and to plant
[1:35:30] that's what was on god's mind
[1:35:32] and what was on jeremiah's mind
[1:35:35] man i can't even talk
[1:35:39] it's a vast difference
[1:35:43] but when
[1:35:46] i believe i was listening to a sermon of
[1:35:48] brother branham and he referred to this
[1:35:49] and i often refers to
[1:35:52] the angel visiting zachariah and telling
[1:35:55] zechariah john's name
[1:35:58] and his ministry
[1:36:00] and who he was in the scripture
[1:36:04] before the child was ever born and all
[1:36:06] john could do john was amazed he said
[1:36:09] i'm this old and elizabeth is this old
[1:36:12] and we're going to have a baby
[1:36:16] and all she could do is scratch it on
[1:36:19] the
[1:36:20] plate can you imagine when elizabeth
[1:36:22] read that
[1:36:24] she said what
[1:36:27] and she went and hid herself it was
[1:36:29] embarrassing she was old she was with
[1:36:31] child the bible says she wouldn't hit
[1:36:33] herself
[1:36:36] but
[1:36:38] the angel told
[1:36:40] zechariah all about john before he was
[1:36:43] born so we can go all through the
[1:36:45] scriptures what about
[1:36:48] the angel of the lord coming to mara
[1:36:52] moriah sampson's mother
[1:36:55] how do you say that
[1:36:58] good you're not
[1:37:00] you're not no better than i am
[1:37:03] but the angel come and said this is
[1:37:05] you're going to be you're going to have
[1:37:06] a son
[1:37:07] and this is who he's going to be and
[1:37:09] this is what he's going to do now if you
[1:37:11] can go all through the scriptures and
[1:37:14] see testimony after testimony of god's
[1:37:17] foreknowledge
[1:37:21] then
[1:37:22] when paul comes and says
[1:37:25] you were predestinated
[1:37:28] to be
[1:37:30] brought
[1:37:31] to this
[1:37:33] image of his son
[1:37:35] you were predestinated
[1:37:38] to this adoption or this maturity in
[1:37:41] christ
[1:37:47] then that word predestination isn't so
[1:37:50] big anymore
[1:37:53] because you can understand it because of
[1:37:55] foreknowledge
[1:37:57] so god knew ahead of time and then he
[1:37:59] made a plan based on his foreknowledge
[1:38:02] and he said i'm going to have a church
[1:38:04] i'm going to have a bride i'm going to
[1:38:06] have a people in the end time when
[1:38:08] things are getting so crazy
[1:38:13] i'm going to have a people that i can
[1:38:14] have a love affair with i'm going to
[1:38:17] have a bride i'm going to be able to
[1:38:19] talk to her heart and she's going to
[1:38:22] from her heart talk back to me i'm going
[1:38:25] to make her clean so she don't have to
[1:38:27] worry about sin no more she's just
[1:38:30] we're gonna be united and this is the
[1:38:34] uniting that's coming
[1:38:37] at the end time and that's what this
[1:38:40] message is bringing us to
[1:38:42] is that kind of a union with our lord
[1:38:45] and savior because the truth
[1:38:48] is being restored to us
[1:38:50] and by the grace of god we are
[1:38:53] embracing it
[1:38:56] so if you are a student of the word of
[1:38:59] god and you listen to tapes
[1:39:02] like i'm sure we all do
[1:39:08] then if something is brought
[1:39:11] that
[1:39:13] makes you say
[1:39:15] did i even have it all right from the
[1:39:18] beginning
[1:39:23] i've been there
[1:39:25] but that shouldn't happen
[1:39:27] and then when i've gone back to my bible
[1:39:30] and and and back to the tapes and back
[1:39:32] to the things brother branham said i
[1:39:34] think i said hey no
[1:39:36] i didn't have it all wrong
[1:39:40] but what is the fruits of something that
[1:39:43] comes
[1:39:44] and would try to shake you down and say
[1:39:47] you never
[1:39:48] really did
[1:39:50] understand you never had it right this
[1:39:53] this is this is
[1:39:55] way beyond
[1:39:57] all of that
[1:39:59] well
[1:40:00] i'm sorry but
[1:40:02] as a student of the word of god and i'm
[1:40:05] sure that you felt the same way god has
[1:40:07] brought us step by step
[1:40:10] in his word like brother branham said
[1:40:12] this morning you might have just enough
[1:40:14] faith to cut out that i'm saved but if
[1:40:18] you cut out that much you know that you
[1:40:20] can never be lost because it's
[1:40:22] unbecoming of god
[1:40:24] to save you knowing that he would lose
[1:40:26] you so you you know you cut out a bigger
[1:40:29] piece than you first thought because you
[1:40:31] said well i'm going to accept his blood
[1:40:34] and his forgiveness for sin
[1:40:36] and and and i'm gonna i'm gonna accept
[1:40:39] that i'm his child
[1:40:41] but as time went on you read your bible
[1:40:44] and you start figuring out that what his
[1:40:46] child is
[1:40:48] you start reading in your bible that if
[1:40:50] i'm his child
[1:40:52] then i'm heir
[1:40:54] to all things
[1:40:57] if i am a child then then i'm an heir
[1:41:00] to everything that god has promised it's
[1:41:03] it these links become inseparable and
[1:41:07] you believe one thing and you think well
[1:41:09] okay well i can believe this and you you
[1:41:12] you go to
[1:41:14] take the part that you understand for
[1:41:17] sure
[1:41:18] and you pull it
[1:41:20] and there's another
[1:41:22] link on it
[1:41:24] and it says if if you're saved
[1:41:28] then you can't be lost
[1:41:31] and if you're redeemed why did he redeem
[1:41:34] you to fill you with his spirit that his
[1:41:37] life could live in you and here's
[1:41:39] another chain and and you start to find
[1:41:42] out that you're just pulling up this big
[1:41:45] bucket of promises and you're thinking
[1:41:47] oh my goodness how
[1:41:49] long
[1:41:50] is this chain
[1:41:58] so i've experienced something in my life
[1:42:00] where
[1:42:02] a certain phrase
[1:42:04] shakes people
[1:42:08] and it's the reference to our lord jesus
[1:42:11] as the son of man who made that
[1:42:14] reference
[1:42:15] jesus
[1:42:17] who does man say that i
[1:42:20] the son of man am
[1:42:22] and i'm not trying to be complicated i'm
[1:42:24] not trying to be a teacher but i'm
[1:42:26] sharing my testimony because i feel a
[1:42:29] sense of urgency as i get older that we
[1:42:33] don't
[1:42:35] somehow drift away from the original
[1:42:38] gospel brother branham didn't preach
[1:42:40] anything
[1:42:41] but this original gospel
[1:42:48] so
[1:42:49] i believe if you read scofield's notes i
[1:42:52] think that he said that jesus referred
[1:42:54] to himself as the son of man
[1:42:57] is it 97 times
[1:43:01] now the other place in the bible that
[1:43:03] you hear this expression is over in
[1:43:05] ezekiel
[1:43:06] and
[1:43:08] the lord
[1:43:09] says to ezekiel son of man
[1:43:12] prophesy
[1:43:15] okay now
[1:43:16] let's take that expression son of man
[1:43:20] and
[1:43:20] i think we preached on it here some
[1:43:22] weeks ago is there anyone that can
[1:43:25] remember that
[1:43:27] okay
[1:43:30] all right
[1:43:32] so
[1:43:34] in the second or third chapter right in
[1:43:37] there maybe several chapters in there
[1:43:42] paul is expressing
[1:43:44] when he goes back into the old testament
[1:43:48] the
[1:43:50] the scriptures that he uses
[1:43:53] when he says
[1:43:55] who is man that thou art mindful of him
[1:43:58] or the son of man that thou visitest him
[1:44:04] all of these old testament
[1:44:06] references are to the condition of man
[1:44:10] you know that man comes up as a grass he
[1:44:12] goes back down to the earth
[1:44:15] that he's uh i know i'm rehearsing these
[1:44:18] things it feels very familiar to me
[1:44:20] whether you remember or not
[1:44:21] i vow not to preach this sermon again in
[1:44:24] the last few minutes
[1:44:26] but that
[1:44:29] the condition of man
[1:44:31] and who is man and what is man he's like
[1:44:33] an animal he dies like an animal
[1:44:36] uh the very place that he lived will
[1:44:38] deny him that he ever even existed you
[1:44:41] know build the house and do ever so
[1:44:43] great but in a certain period of time
[1:44:45] it's it's gonna lie against you and say
[1:44:47] he wasn't even here
[1:44:51] and there's so many scriptures like that
[1:44:53] i just remembered just recently reading
[1:44:57] psalms 90 is very much on that theme
[1:44:59] ecclesiastics has many chapters on that
[1:45:02] theme job was on that theme who is man
[1:45:08] okay
[1:45:09] what is man
[1:45:12] or the son of man so son of man is just
[1:45:15] a man that's born of another man it's
[1:45:17] it's he's just every man that's born
[1:45:20] that way
[1:45:22] he comes in the to into the world
[1:45:24] speaking lies his his days are numbered
[1:45:26] and the very
[1:45:28] skin rooms that are going to eat your
[1:45:30] flesh are in your body now it's it's not
[1:45:33] very flattering information but it's a
[1:45:36] very
[1:45:37] real
[1:45:40] it's it's a very real description of who
[1:45:43] we are
[1:45:45] and paul brings these
[1:45:48] prophecies
[1:45:53] about how that emmanuel that god will
[1:45:57] become
[1:45:58] man
[1:46:00] and when he was on earth he identified
[1:46:02] himself as the son of man
[1:46:05] he didn't go around and say i'm the son
[1:46:07] of god
[1:46:09] he called himself
[1:46:11] the son of man
[1:46:13] now to me this was a beautiful thing
[1:46:15] when i really studied the book of
[1:46:18] hebrews
[1:46:19] to understand
[1:46:22] that jesus was every bit man brother
[1:46:25] branham said he was tempted every way
[1:46:29] like as we are tempted even tempted with
[1:46:32] lust the first time i heard the prophet
[1:46:34] say that i i
[1:46:36] i thought that can't be so
[1:46:40] but he was every bit man and that's why
[1:46:43] he was called
[1:46:44] the son of man
[1:46:47] that's the
[1:46:49] prevailing
[1:46:51] revelation of the book of hebrews is
[1:46:54] that he
[1:46:55] became every bit man
[1:46:58] and it's supported all through the word
[1:47:00] of god because how could he be your
[1:47:03] kinsman
[1:47:05] if he was just an angel you know
[1:47:09] god kind of
[1:47:11] uh you know
[1:47:14] putting on a guy's you know
[1:47:17] going back to heaven and saying
[1:47:20] you know
[1:47:21] but he didn't he came
[1:47:25] as
[1:47:26] and lived as we are the
[1:47:29] the book of romans said
[1:47:32] he became sinful
[1:47:35] he came in sinful flesh you can't
[1:47:38] put the words
[1:47:40] but what paul is trying to show in in
[1:47:43] hebrews that he wasn't just an angel or
[1:47:46] some other kind of being but he became
[1:47:49] man kinsmen
[1:47:52] to us why
[1:47:54] because the law of redemption required a
[1:47:57] kinsmen not a distant relative
[1:48:00] not you know somebody that you had the
[1:48:02] paperwork that this is my legal guardian
[1:48:05] or something like that but but he became
[1:48:08] your kinsmen that's why this revelation
[1:48:11] of of
[1:48:13] god coming down in flesh is so important
[1:48:17] is because he had to do that to refer
[1:48:20] to to fulfill the law of a kinsmen
[1:48:23] redeemer what is another thing he had to
[1:48:26] fulfill he had to fulfill that picture
[1:48:29] of the high priest and remember in
[1:48:31] hebrews how brother
[1:48:33] paul said
[1:48:35] a priest
[1:48:37] he's got
[1:48:38] he's full of infirmity too so he can
[1:48:44] have in the temple that that priest can
[1:48:48] have
[1:48:49] compassion on those that are
[1:48:52] out of the way
[1:48:54] and he offers a sacrifice for his own
[1:48:56] sins and for your sin
[1:48:59] so he fulfills that
[1:49:01] high
[1:49:02] priest
[1:49:05] and then he had to be the first
[1:49:08] god forgive me for using the expression
[1:49:10] but some of the men would understand as
[1:49:13] the prototype
[1:49:15] of what every other
[1:49:17] would be
[1:49:18] jesus was
[1:49:21] the god man and and god was bringing
[1:49:24] forth the first
[1:49:26] son
[1:49:28] and he weighs the lord jesus christ
[1:49:32] the sheaf wasn't brother branham
[1:49:34] brother branham was waving the sheaf
[1:49:37] jesus was
[1:49:39] the first one to raise from the dead he
[1:49:41] was the first one to prove
[1:49:44] that there was eternal life in the seed
[1:49:47] so when that seed come up out of the
[1:49:50] ground that's what they did in the old
[1:49:51] testament the first
[1:49:55] seemed to come to maturity
[1:49:58] and that's a very key word there because
[1:50:01] maturity
[1:50:05] in that context isn't like us becoming
[1:50:07] mature christians
[1:50:12] that first seed that
[1:50:15] was jesus
[1:50:16] raising from the grave
[1:50:18] showing that there's death after life
[1:50:23] the same seed that went into the tomb
[1:50:26] came up again
[1:50:28] not a different one but to show
[1:50:31] that the life that he had
[1:50:34] and he waved that over the people that
[1:50:37] those that are in christ could say that
[1:50:39] same life that was in him if it be in
[1:50:41] him it will produce the same thing
[1:50:45] so brother branham was waving the sheaf
[1:50:48] of of our lord jesus christ the
[1:50:51] resurrected christ jesus christ the same
[1:50:55] yesterday today and forever
[1:50:58] the same lord jesus and in the book of
[1:51:01] acts it says this
[1:51:03] same
[1:51:04] jesus
[1:51:06] that you see that you've touched that
[1:51:08] you felt
[1:51:09] this
[1:51:11] emmanuel in a corporal body he will
[1:51:14] return
[1:51:16] in like manner
[1:51:19] at
[1:51:20] his second coming
[1:51:26] it isn't to be misunderstood that he was
[1:51:30] taken up in a cloud
[1:51:32] and he comes back as a cloud
[1:51:35] that's not right
[1:51:38] jesus doesn't come back as a cloud
[1:51:41] he comes back in a corporal body that is
[1:51:44] the second coming of the lord
[1:51:47] now for me to be a stand-alone rock i
[1:51:50] got to know what i believe
[1:51:53] and i know that the prophet has said
[1:51:55] that said that there's three
[1:51:57] comings
[1:51:59] of the lord
[1:52:01] okay he came to redeem his bride
[1:52:05] he comes to rapture his bride
[1:52:08] and he comes back with his bride to
[1:52:10] reign in a millennium there's only three
[1:52:13] comings
[1:52:14] so now that we can hammer down and
[1:52:17] that's not moving anywhere
[1:52:20] now we know that there's many appearings
[1:52:23] of the lord
[1:52:25] the lord
[1:52:27] took
[1:52:30] a pure debris gave one body to each
[1:52:32] angel and
[1:52:34] he appeared to to to abraham he appeared
[1:52:39] in that pillar of fire at the
[1:52:42] river
[1:52:44] at the ohio river it was an appearing of
[1:52:46] the lord
[1:52:48] he appeared
[1:52:49] at
[1:52:52] sam houston coliseum
[1:52:55] and had his picture taken in that light
[1:52:58] brother ram said that's the light that
[1:52:59] paul saw
[1:53:03] so throughout these scriptures when when
[1:53:05] jesus came to paul
[1:53:08] it was jesus but it wasn't
[1:53:10] another coming of the lord
[1:53:16] so there was the first advent of christ
[1:53:19] and there shall be the second advent of
[1:53:21] christ or the second coming and we know
[1:53:24] that that second coming will be in a
[1:53:27] corporal
[1:53:28] body
[1:53:29] and these are things
[1:53:30] we know for sure
[1:53:34] it's
[1:53:36] if i'm a little stoned
[1:53:38] on these points i'm a standalone rock
[1:53:42] these are things
[1:53:44] i know assuredly
[1:53:48] now
[1:53:49] moses said
[1:53:51] the lord your
[1:53:52] god will raise up a prophet
[1:53:56] like unto me
[1:54:00] now what is a prophet a prophet
[1:54:03] is a man
[1:54:04] that has the word of the lord on his
[1:54:06] lips
[1:54:08] and that's what they resented about
[1:54:10] moses they said well
[1:54:12] how is it that you think that it's all
[1:54:15] on you
[1:54:16] that only you have the word of the lord
[1:54:19] when you're just a man like us and we're
[1:54:22] all men that god can talk to
[1:54:25] and
[1:54:26] who do you say and the lord
[1:54:29] told moses separate yourself
[1:54:34] and he opened up the earth and he
[1:54:36] swallowed up all those gangsters
[1:54:39] was moses more than a man
[1:54:43] no
[1:54:44] he was the son of man
[1:54:48] not
[1:54:49] the son of man like jesus referred to
[1:54:52] himself but he was he was just a son of
[1:54:53] man he was just a man that's born a man
[1:54:56] he was just a man but but the word of
[1:54:58] the lord was on his lips and god spoke
[1:55:01] lip tier with moses and he said god said
[1:55:04] you know i'll show signs and things and
[1:55:06] speak to men in dreams but not like
[1:55:09] moses i speak lip to ear to him
[1:55:12] but that's what a prophet was
[1:55:15] a prophet had god speaking to him and so
[1:55:19] then that was god's word to the people
[1:55:22] but it was still a man
[1:55:26] so that's why
[1:55:28] when in ezekiel when god said son of man
[1:55:31] prophesy
[1:55:33] it's just hey you're a man but i'm going
[1:55:35] to put my words on your lips
[1:55:39] so moses said i'm going to raise up
[1:55:42] god's going to raise up excuse me god's
[1:55:44] going to raise up a prophet
[1:55:48] like unto me
[1:55:53] so when jesus came
[1:55:57] they went as far as to say
[1:56:02] this is a mighty prophet in other words
[1:56:04] what he speaks
[1:56:07] comes to pass
[1:56:09] they weren't ready
[1:56:11] to accept the fact that
[1:56:15] jesus was
[1:56:17] not really the son of man he was the son
[1:56:20] of god
[1:56:22] but jesus gave himself that title the
[1:56:25] son of man he said to peter who does man
[1:56:28] say i the son of man am
[1:56:30] and he talked about the son of man being
[1:56:33] lifted up i know this is it's quarter to
[1:56:36] seven now we'll try to wrap it up
[1:56:39] but he
[1:56:40] said this as as moses lifted up the
[1:56:45] serpent
[1:56:49] so shall the son of man be
[1:56:52] lifted up and they said
[1:56:55] i thought they they said the the
[1:56:58] scribes say
[1:57:02] that
[1:57:04] the messiah
[1:57:05] liveth forever
[1:57:08] who is this son of man
[1:57:11] so they're starting to recognize and
[1:57:13] trying to receive jesus as the christ
[1:57:15] but when he talked about being crucified
[1:57:18] they couldn't understand
[1:57:20] and they said well the scribes say that
[1:57:22] he liveth forever
[1:57:24] how say ye
[1:57:26] that the son of man shall be lifted up
[1:57:28] who is this son of man
[1:57:32] well they
[1:57:33] they were perplexed
[1:57:35] by jesus referring to himself as the son
[1:57:38] of man
[1:57:40] so if you're a bible reader this
[1:57:42] expression son of man should not be
[1:57:44] strange to you we know
[1:57:47] that the son of man is our lord jesus
[1:57:51] then jesus said when the son of man
[1:57:54] returns
[1:57:56] when jesus
[1:57:58] i just reading the other day in the book
[1:58:00] of
[1:58:01] oneness
[1:58:05] brother branham i'm quoting
[1:58:07] jesus said
[1:58:09] at the coming of the son of man there'll
[1:58:11] be one in the bed
[1:58:14] one shall be taken one shall be left
[1:58:16] there'll be one in the field one shall
[1:58:17] be taken at the coming of the son of man
[1:58:20] what is that the coming of the lord the
[1:58:22] second coming of christ
[1:58:24] that's what the coming
[1:58:26] of the son of man is
[1:58:31] and you say what are you trying to say
[1:58:33] brother dennis that seems so simple
[1:58:38] well
[1:58:41] brother branham refers to luke
[1:58:43] 17 30
[1:58:45] and he talks about the revealing of the
[1:58:49] son of man
[1:58:50] that's not the coming of the son of man
[1:58:53] that's when the son of man
[1:58:56] is revealed and that is what happened in
[1:58:58] brother branham's ministry was
[1:59:00] jesus revealed himself in his word
[1:59:04] and restored the
[1:59:06] original revelation
[1:59:09] of who he is
[1:59:11] and all this bible that was this
[1:59:14] glorious
[1:59:15] wonderful
[1:59:17] book of redemption all those loose ends
[1:59:20] and mysteries were tied up and so we
[1:59:22] could see god's whole plan
[1:59:25] in this book of redemption
[1:59:28] and this ministry of brother branham's
[1:59:30] which was a prophetic ministry
[1:59:33] in other words brother branham was a man
[1:59:37] with the word of the lord on his lips
[1:59:39] and in his ministry
[1:59:42] jesus christ was revealing himself
[1:59:47] and that's what we believe
[1:59:50] we believe that it wasn't brother
[1:59:52] branham's intellect
[1:59:54] that these visions that brother branham
[1:59:56] had that wasn't brother branham that was
[1:59:59] the lord appearing
[2:00:00] in this ministry
[2:00:03] and so it wasn't the second coming of
[2:00:06] the lord
[2:00:07] it wasn't
[2:00:11] it was as we were as we have taught and
[2:00:14] are understood it is
[2:00:18] the revealing of the son of man jesus
[2:00:21] by a prophet
[2:00:24] a son of man
[2:00:26] revealing
[2:00:28] the son of man there's only one
[2:00:32] the
[2:00:33] son of man and that's an expression that
[2:00:35] jesus used
[2:00:37] of himself
[2:00:41] and so
[2:00:43] as a
[2:00:47] bible believer and christian student in
[2:00:50] a
[2:00:52] and as a private student that wants to
[2:00:54] rightly
[2:00:56] divide
[2:00:58] the word of god
[2:01:04] i am very concerned with something
[2:01:07] that would cause the believer
[2:01:11] to say
[2:01:13] did i ever have it right
[2:01:16] did i ever believe like what
[2:01:19] what's that doing to your faith the
[2:01:22] scripture says in one place that those
[2:01:25] that said the resurrection is already
[2:01:28] past
[2:01:30] overthrow
[2:01:32] the faith of some
[2:01:34] and paul said
[2:01:36] that's hayamaneas and felidus
[2:01:40] believe it yes
[2:01:42] and he said in another place he said who
[2:01:45] i have turned over to satan that they
[2:01:47] would learn
[2:01:49] not to blaspheme
[2:01:53] so
[2:01:55] i'm not enough of a of a theologian i i
[2:02:00] i don't have the power
[2:02:02] of discernment
[2:02:04] to say well
[2:02:06] you know you ever heard people they take
[2:02:08] an old uh
[2:02:11] testament story and they say well you're
[2:02:13] just jehoiada
[2:02:15] and your mind races you know like okay
[2:02:17] they've typed me as this
[2:02:20] bible character am i in trouble or
[2:02:22] what
[2:02:24] well they took the liberty
[2:02:27] to
[2:02:28] put you in a bible
[2:02:30] story do they have really the right to
[2:02:33] do that no do they know
[2:02:36] no
[2:02:37] they don't know
[2:02:39] but i as a private student of the word
[2:02:42] of god have to consider the words of
[2:02:44] paul that he said those that say the
[2:02:47] resurrection are already past
[2:02:51] he warned timothy to stay away from that
[2:02:55] and he said they overthrow the faith of
[2:02:59] son
[2:03:10] so the finish line
[2:03:13] for christians is very clear
[2:03:17] it's the coming of the lord it's the
[2:03:19] second coming of the lord
[2:03:21] we know
[2:03:23] that he came
[2:03:25] as
[2:03:27] son of man
[2:03:29] in as a prophet
[2:03:33] to israel
[2:03:37] and in his
[2:03:39] earthly
[2:03:41] journey
[2:03:42] he was referred to as
[2:03:45] son of man
[2:03:48] now what's so marvelous about it was he
[2:03:50] was the son of god it was god himself
[2:03:54] emmanuel he became so much man that he
[2:03:58] identified himself so much with man he
[2:04:01] called himself the son of man but
[2:04:04] he was
[2:04:05] god
[2:04:06] with us
[2:04:12] so in his earthly ministry
[2:04:15] he was called the son of man
[2:04:18] now in the church ages
[2:04:20] when he walked among the seven coal
[2:04:24] golden candlesticks it was christ
[2:04:27] himself but now he's resurrected and
[2:04:31] he's in his church in the form of the
[2:04:33] holy spirit
[2:04:36] and
[2:04:37] that dispensation or that time
[2:04:41] he's called the son of god
[2:04:44] son of man
[2:04:46] son of god in the church ages
[2:04:49] spirit
[2:04:50] formed tabernacling in the believers
[2:04:54] walking on in the midst of the seven can
[2:04:57] church candlesticks
[2:04:59] the same lord jesus
[2:05:03] but in a different form
[2:05:06] so they're son of man
[2:05:08] son of god and this son of god
[2:05:10] dispensation continues until he comes as
[2:05:15] son of david
[2:05:17] to establish his reign he comes back as
[2:05:21] the king he's always been the king
[2:05:24] but he didn't wear that girdle
[2:05:27] around his paths he wore it around his
[2:05:30] waist
[2:05:31] as a servant
[2:05:35] to be a priest to be an intercessor to
[2:05:37] be a savior to be a kinsman
[2:05:40] but when he comes as son of david now
[2:05:43] he's
[2:05:45] king and he's going to take his rightly
[2:05:48] brightly place
[2:05:51] and he's coming for his
[2:05:53] millennial reign to reign with his
[2:05:55] saints
[2:05:57] so son of man
[2:05:59] son of god
[2:06:00] son of david and never get your threes
[2:06:04] mixed up we we know these things
[2:06:10] so it never should be
[2:06:12] so what happens when
[2:06:15] when jesus
[2:06:16] comes his second time
[2:06:19] what happens
[2:06:21] the dead in christ
[2:06:24] race
[2:06:26] and they ask in the
[2:06:31] questions and answers they said
[2:06:34] what kind of body will we have in the
[2:06:36] resurrection
[2:06:39] and brother branham says you look it up
[2:06:41] and he says the same kind of body that
[2:06:44] jesus had when he was on earth
[2:06:48] but we'll have a glorified body when he
[2:06:51] appears we shall be like him we'll have
[2:06:55] a body like his body
[2:07:00] so
[2:07:01] at the second coming of the lord
[2:07:04] the dead in christ
[2:07:07] race
[2:07:09] and we which are alive and remain are
[2:07:12] caught up together
[2:07:14] with them
[2:07:15] to forever be with our lord
[2:07:20] now if i'm going to be a stand-alone
[2:07:22] rock
[2:07:24] i'm not being pulled
[2:07:27] from the things that god's made real to
[2:07:30] me the revelation that god gave
[2:07:32] me
[2:07:37] and that
[2:07:38] finish line for the believer
[2:07:41] is the resurrection and the rapture
[2:07:45] and that's got to be very clear in your
[2:07:47] mind that when they stretch they used to
[2:07:50] i don't know what they do now but
[2:07:52] you know when i was in high school and
[2:07:53] you ran a race they had a little ribbon
[2:07:55] across the they stretched across
[2:07:58] and when you ran across that line you
[2:08:00] tried to even put your chest out just
[2:08:03] might make the
[2:08:04] one tenth of a second
[2:08:08] come across that line
[2:08:14] well
[2:08:15] if you're a runner you're you're putting
[2:08:17] everything out to cross that line
[2:08:20] it'd be a shame to think somebody's
[2:08:22] moving it
[2:08:24] and you got to look backwards and say
[2:08:25] did i
[2:08:27] where where's that at
[2:08:30] wouldn't that be a sight to see all the
[2:08:31] runners you know they're running fast
[2:08:34] and hard and they're going to go across
[2:08:36] that finish line and then they go like
[2:08:40] where is it at
[2:08:42] did i miss it did i ever have i been
[2:08:45] running this thing
[2:08:47] right
[2:08:52] no
[2:08:55] that's not the gospel
[2:08:58] that we received
[2:09:00] the gospel will always have a clear
[2:09:03] sound
[2:09:06] i'd like to just
[2:09:08] read you a little quote
[2:09:10] in closing and i do mean closing
[2:09:18] and
[2:09:18] i'm not much of a high-tech guy
[2:09:22] but i did bring it up this afternoon
[2:09:25] and i do this because it helped me
[2:09:28] and and i feel
[2:09:29] i
[2:09:30] you know i'm i'm not
[2:09:32] so much an elder but
[2:09:36] i'm not the same young man that brother
[2:09:38] perry called up before about 600 people
[2:09:41] and asked why you didn't take communion
[2:09:44] i'm not that guy
[2:09:47] true story
[2:09:49] i think we've shared it before
[2:10:00] so let me have your attention and i'll
[2:10:01] share where this is this is in
[2:10:04] 1962 this is the message perseverance
[2:10:11] it's not showing me where it's preached
[2:10:13] but anyway it's
[2:10:15] the month of june in the eighth day
[2:10:19] 1962 perseverance
[2:10:28] just before a prayer line
[2:10:33] i can't
[2:10:34] remember you know there was probably
[2:10:35] discernment and prayer line
[2:10:39] brother adam says this
[2:10:43] did you know
[2:10:44] that the bible speaks of the appearing
[2:10:46] of the lord
[2:10:48] and also the coming of the lord
[2:10:51] and it's two different works
[2:10:55] search it and find it out if that's
[2:10:58] right
[2:11:00] the appearing
[2:11:01] and the coming is two different things
[2:11:04] the appearing of the lord is now
[2:11:08] he's appearing amongst his people
[2:11:10] we see him in his same works the
[2:11:13] appearing
[2:11:14] his holy spirit
[2:11:17] but his coming will be in a physical
[2:11:20] being it will be to catch the church up
[2:11:25] but see we've been down through the word
[2:11:28] justification sanctification baptism of
[2:11:30] the holy ghost and now the church is
[2:11:32] getting in such a condition ready
[2:11:34] waiting
[2:11:36] the offices of the church is coming into
[2:11:39] place the teachers are placing the
[2:11:40] places the gifts are manifesting
[2:11:42] themselves
[2:11:44] oh there are a lot of impersonations
[2:11:46] that's right we expect that but there's
[2:11:48] a real too
[2:11:50] before there can be a bogus dollar there
[2:11:53] has to be a real one for that to be made
[2:11:55] off of that's right we have all those
[2:11:58] carnal comparisons but that don't take
[2:12:00] away from the real it's only makes the
[2:12:03] real shine out
[2:12:05] so the lord
[2:12:07] is now appearing amongst his people
[2:12:09] great signs and wonders
[2:12:12] raising the dead healing the sick and
[2:12:15] doing the very same things
[2:12:17] that he did
[2:12:19] that hasn't been done
[2:12:21] for 2000 years see
[2:12:25] see
[2:12:25] the church is honed up through that
[2:12:28] brought up till it's right at the time
[2:12:30] of the headstone is coming to meet the
[2:12:32] church and then it'll go all together
[2:12:36] and be raptured
[2:12:39] the ones fell asleep in the first watch
[2:12:41] second watch third watch on to the
[2:12:43] seventh watch the appearing of the lord
[2:12:46] the last night we
[2:12:48] touched on that
[2:12:51] so
[2:12:53] the challenging part of this
[2:12:55] my friends and
[2:12:59] is that
[2:13:01] in the king james and in the new
[2:13:03] testament in the bible that you read
[2:13:06] the second coming of the lord
[2:13:08] is referred by paul
[2:13:11] as when the lord appears
[2:13:14] when he appears in glory we shall be
[2:13:17] like him
[2:13:18] so you see it's a little bit of a
[2:13:21] of a challenge
[2:13:23] to recognize that
[2:13:25] all in the old testament bible paul's
[2:13:28] talking about the appearing of the lord
[2:13:30] as his second coming
[2:13:34] is that confusing to you raise your hand
[2:13:36] if that's a little confusing okay thank
[2:13:39] you thank you i appreciate you saying
[2:13:41] that
[2:13:42] so i just want to take try to be very
[2:13:44] clear
[2:13:46] but in the king james bible that word
[2:13:48] appearing
[2:13:50] when he shall appear that's his second
[2:13:53] coming
[2:13:56] okay
[2:14:00] now brother branhams
[2:14:02] takes it just a little different and he
[2:14:04] says
[2:14:06] you know he appears by
[2:14:10] discerning
[2:14:12] the thoughts and the intents of the
[2:14:13] heart
[2:14:14] by raising the dead
[2:14:16] by opening blind eyes
[2:14:19] he says that's not the coming of the
[2:14:20] lord
[2:14:22] that's just the lord appearing amongst
[2:14:24] us
[2:14:28] and doing these signs and wonders
[2:14:30] because he promised to do these things
[2:14:32] before the second coming of the lord
[2:14:38] now as a student of the word of god i
[2:14:41] recognize
[2:14:43] that teachers have mixed these things up
[2:14:47] and they
[2:14:50] they use these expressions from the new
[2:14:53] testament
[2:14:55] and say well
[2:14:57] you know
[2:14:58] he's come
[2:14:59] he's come in some form he's he's
[2:15:04] you know there's been a there's been
[2:15:06] another coming that's not one of the
[2:15:09] three
[2:15:10] well that's not so
[2:15:13] there's been him making himself known
[2:15:17] but it's it's not one of those three
[2:15:19] comings you see as a as a student of the
[2:15:21] word of god you nail that down and you
[2:15:23] say
[2:15:24] okay the coming of the lord is in a is
[2:15:27] in a corporal body and this that after
[2:15:31] the resurrection when the dead in christ
[2:15:33] shall rise then he shall appear
[2:15:36] okay
[2:15:36] and so
[2:15:38] i don't mean
[2:15:39] to challenge you but there is a little
[2:15:43] thing of at the bible study a bible
[2:15:46] student will see a word as paul used it
[2:15:50] and paul is always re using that word
[2:15:54] to refer to as the second coming of the
[2:15:56] lord
[2:15:58] but you got to be enough of a student to
[2:16:01] see that
[2:16:02] to recognize that's the that's the old
[2:16:06] english that's the bible terminology
[2:16:09] when he shall appear but now in our day
[2:16:13] we talk about the second coming of the
[2:16:15] lord
[2:16:16] okay
[2:16:17] but
[2:16:20] what the lord jesus did in brother
[2:16:23] branham's ministry was just to show
[2:16:25] himself that's an appearing of the lord
[2:16:28] and that's what brother branham said in
[2:16:29] the quote
[2:16:31] and so you say well
[2:16:32] brother dennis i wish it wasn't so
[2:16:34] confusing
[2:16:36] is
[2:16:38] is it so that the lord allows these
[2:16:40] things to be
[2:16:43] perhaps
[2:16:46] and i'm not a teacher but
[2:16:51] saints of god it concerns me
[2:16:57] that it would be put before the people
[2:16:59] that
[2:17:01] this rapture is a 50-year process
[2:17:06] or
[2:17:07] that when the cloud appeared on sunset
[2:17:10] mountain that that was the coming of the
[2:17:12] lord
[2:17:14] and now we're going to go all this time
[2:17:16] and it's just going to culminate in the
[2:17:18] change of our bodies
[2:17:21] no
[2:17:23] no brother branham explained what the
[2:17:25] cloud was and he said that's a
[2:17:26] vindication
[2:17:28] of my ministry of the deity of the lord
[2:17:32] jesus christ
[2:17:33] it's a sign
[2:17:35] in the heavens
[2:17:37] that's not
[2:17:38] the coming
[2:17:40] of the lord
[2:17:42] and and you say well brothers you know
[2:17:44] why would you have to be so plain
[2:17:46] because we're living in a day in an hour
[2:17:49] where
[2:17:50] of necessity
[2:17:52] you're going to need to be a student of
[2:17:55] the word of god so that you're not
[2:17:58] tossed
[2:17:59] by every
[2:18:01] wind of doctrine
[2:18:03] you know who you are
[2:18:06] you know what you believe
[2:18:15] as the son of god i
[2:18:17] i want to embrace the word of god i i
[2:18:20] want to receive everything that god has
[2:18:22] for me
[2:18:26] but if something's pre
[2:18:30] presented that
[2:18:32] contradicts the word of god
[2:18:37] the coming of the son of man is a future
[2:18:40] event
[2:18:43] because the coming of jesus is a future
[2:18:46] event the rapture is a future event
[2:18:50] our lord coming back to earth
[2:18:54] again
[2:18:56] oh my
[2:18:57] i can remember that ringing in this
[2:18:59] tabernacle oh our lord is coming back to
[2:19:02] earth again let's stand together
[2:19:06] i trust by the grace of god that this
[2:19:08] service has been a blessing to you
[2:19:13] let's sing that song for our lord is
[2:19:16] coming back to earth again
[2:19:19] how glorious
[2:19:21] that will be
[2:19:24] what a wonderful thing
[2:19:34] i'm sorry
[2:19:44] [Music]
[2:19:49] john the baptist said
[2:19:53] a man can receive nothing
[2:19:56] unless it be given to him of god
[2:20:06] so if a demand is made of me to be
[2:20:10] something i'm not
[2:20:14] or to embrace something i
[2:20:18] can't understand
[2:20:22] i want to be like
[2:20:24] john the baptist and he just said
[2:20:32] i can only be what what god made me
[2:20:36] i just rejoice at the voice
[2:20:41] of the bridegroom
[2:20:43] he that hath the bride
[2:20:45] he's the bridegroom
[2:20:48] it's god that gives revelation it's god
[2:20:51] that gives
[2:20:52] understanding i just want to stay close
[2:20:56] enough to him
[2:20:59] and live a surrendered life that he can
[2:21:01] talk to me
[2:21:02] and help me
[2:21:04] to understand and without that
[2:21:07] i'm
[2:21:08] lost i don't have a clue
[2:21:12] unless he
[2:21:13] would help me
[2:21:15] and i'm trusting he will because he
[2:21:17] promised he would
[2:21:19] that his spirit would lead me
[2:21:22] and guide me
[2:21:23] into all truth
[2:21:25] let's sing it i've kept you a long time
[2:21:28] god bless you

[2:30:46] saints had to be dead to be saints

[2:30:54] catholic system and i went to catholic
[2:30:57] grade school and catholic high school
[2:31:00] and they're supposed to make you
[2:31:02] you know get you ready to be a priest
