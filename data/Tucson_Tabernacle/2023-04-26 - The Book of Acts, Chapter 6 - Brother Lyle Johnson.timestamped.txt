[24:35] words
[24:36] because of the situation that I was
[24:40] going through and then I want to sing
[24:42] this song because many times
[24:47] Pastor was saying the other day we go
[24:49] through things
[24:51] and these things they make us to have
[24:54] questions
[24:55] and we start asking why is the this
[24:59] thing happening what is the reason why
[25:01] but I want to say you don't need to
[25:05] understand
[25:06] because his words
[25:09] are always past finding amen we will
[25:12] never understand him
[25:15] the only thing that we need to do is
[25:18] just to hold his hand
[25:20] amen

[26:00] but I know My Savior Lives
[26:06] he will guide me
[26:09] by his end
[26:11] I don't need to understand
[26:17] anymore
[26:24] the ranging sea
[26:27] storms of life
[26:30] overwhelm my heart
[26:33] on my heart start to wander the reason
[26:39] why
[26:43] but I know My Savior Lives
[26:49] he'll guide me by his end
[26:54] I don't need to understand
[27:05] I don't need to understand
[27:10] I just need to hold his hand
[27:15] I don't need to ask my Lord
[27:20] the reason why
[27:26] foreign
[27:37] [Music]
[27:42] anymore
[27:47] I don't need
[27:49] to understand
[27:52] I just need to order
[27:58] I don't need
[28:00] to ask my Lord
[28:03] the reason why
[28:08] for I know you will make a way
[28:14] through the night
[28:17] through the day
[28:20] I don't need to understand anymore
[28:29] my faith is beautiful nothing less
[28:35] like once Christ my Lord my soul eater
[28:41] of all the Devil Comes and votes
[28:46] push me around
[28:48] round and round but my uncle holds
[28:54] within the Veil
[28:57] cries the savior
[28:59] in control
[29:02] I don't need to understand
[29:14] or nothing less
[29:18] but crush this sorry and sorry no
[29:23] for the Devil comes and goes
[29:28] and to push me around and round and
[29:32] round
[29:33] but my anchor holds
[29:36] within the verb
[29:38] across the Savior and his power
[29:42] in control
[29:45] I don't need to understand
[29:57] to understand
[30:00] I just need to hold his hands
[30:06] I don't need
[30:08] to ask my Lord
[30:16] foreign
[30:38] I don't need

[31:31] I don't need to ask my Lord
[31:36] the reason why
[31:41] before foreign
[31:48] [Music]
[31:50] through the day
[31:53] I don't need
[32:09] [Applause]
[32:15] do you think cousin Jonathan did a good
[32:17] job
[32:21] you know let's listen to that song
[32:24] and I was thinking about a child maybe a
[32:28] three-year-old or a two-year-old child
[32:30] and how the mom and the dad they they
[32:32] take
[32:34] the little boy a little girl's hand and
[32:36] they they walk him along and that child
[32:39] doesn't understand where he's going
[32:41] that child doesn't he he doesn't
[32:43] understand and he doesn't need to
[32:45] understand he just needs to hold Mom's
[32:47] hand
[32:48] and that's that's how we are
[32:51] um
[32:53] one day
[32:54] I'm gonna have
[32:56] this guy give his testimony
[32:59] and I'll tell you what it's tremendous
[33:04] how he is here and what he's gone
[33:06] through
[33:09] back home in his home country of Zambia
[33:12] and in Botswana
[33:15] and I know it'll be a blessing to you
[33:17] but I have to warn you I don't think
[33:18] there's going to be a dry eye in this
[33:20] whole place
[33:23] um
[33:24] for uh for next weekend
[33:28] announced that we'll have meetings with
[33:30] Jericho Tabernacle in Phoenix brother
[33:33] Aaron McGary will be preaching on Friday
[33:36] night
[33:37] I will be preaching on Saturday night
[33:39] and brother Steve Robson will be
[33:41] preaching on Sunday morning
[33:43] I will probably
[33:45] um
[33:47] probably go up and I might I might have
[33:50] a few extra seats in my car if if some
[33:53] of the brothers want to go up with me
[33:55] we'll probably go up Friday
[33:59] stay Friday night and then come home
[34:01] late Saturday night
[34:04] um
[34:06] and then if cousin Jonathan is up for it
[34:10] he'll be he'll be preaching next Sunday
[34:12] we're not sure if it's going to be the
[34:13] morning or the evening surface
[34:15] he's already agreed to it
[34:17] um
[34:19] I wanted to ask for prayer
[34:22] for two friends of mine

[34:40] unexpected
[34:42] his son Andrew's son is one of my son my
[34:45] son Daniel's closest friends
[34:48] her name is Sister Elsie so maybe we
[34:51] could remember the family in prayer
[34:55] and then another friend of mine Nathan
[34:57] Jones
[34:59] um
[35:00] from Jeffersonville his wife died about

[35:25] side

[35:35] in a prayer request for two young women
[35:37] a couple of weeks ago

[35:41] I want to thank the Lord that both both
[35:43] prayers are in the midst of being
[35:45] answered as his light has shined on them
[35:48] since the prayer request was put in and
[35:50] both are now in contact with their
[35:53] mothers and seeking a more positive path
[35:57] and then another one he says same
[35:59] brother Justin he says I want to thank
[36:00] the Lord he knew I had car trouble and I
[36:03] had prayed and he made a way and my car
[36:05] was fixed today

[36:08] [Applause]
[36:13] um I want to share a little something I
[36:15] baptized a sister on Sunday morning
[36:18] and um
[36:21] she obviously she's a ladies lived a
[36:25] hard life
[36:27] she's been on drugs and she she carries
[36:30] the marks from being on drugs you could
[36:33] see it enter and
[36:37] um
[36:37] but I'll tell you what that lady is
[36:40] changing
[36:42] she uh sister Amelia was given the
[36:43] testimony to me earlier she said that
[36:46] she's been going around the building
[36:48] that she lives in and preaching to other
[36:50] people how they need to get right
[36:54] [Applause]
[36:58] but brother Daniel she's she's judging
[37:01] the other people sister it's okay
[37:03] praise the Lord that she's she's pointed
[37:06] in the right direction I was so honored
[37:09] to baptize her when she went up there
[37:10] and as I said before to the congregation
[37:13] be patient
[37:15] with these people they've lived a hard
[37:18] life and we see many many coming that
[37:22] that maybe bear the scars of the world
[37:25] but remember that those scars are in our
[37:30] flesh
[37:31] but that Spirit can be renewed
[37:35] so I do appreciate the church's kindness
[37:38] and and the patience
[37:40] and she's she seems very happy am I
[37:44] right sister Amelia God bless her heart
[37:47] you know Define the Lord and as low as
[37:51] she was is it Fentanyl
[37:55] is that uh that was that was one of the
[37:58] drugs that she was taking
[37:59] God just
[38:01] you don't come back from that stuff
[38:04] coming back I I thank the Lord for that
[38:07] I thank the Lord for a group of people
[38:08] that are willing to make us sacrifice
[38:12] and friends we do we we can just we can
[38:15] just have a church that's just all a
[38:18] certain class of people or a certain
[38:20] group of people
[38:22] but what about those Souls that are lost
[38:26] they're the most important Jesus himself
[38:30] said he said it's the ones that are sick
[38:32] that need a physician
[38:34] not the ones that aren't sick
[38:36] I I'm just so blessed
[38:39] and I have a feeling we're gonna have
[38:40] some more baptisms coming up soon
[38:44] [Music]
[38:48] I'm grateful
[38:49] I'm grateful to the Lord let's stand
[38:53] as we bring these requests
[38:55] before our lord Jesus
[38:57] [Music]
[38:59] Bauer heads
[39:03] think on the Lord
[39:06] think on how good he is
[39:08] [Music]
[39:10] and he's here
[39:11] and he answers prayer
[39:13] he promised wherever two or three are
[39:16] gathered in my name there I will be in
[39:19] the midst of him
[39:20] so he's here he's listening he's
[39:23] watching
[39:24] if you have a prayer request that you
[39:26] might have upon your heart for yourself
[39:28] or someone else
[39:29] would you raise your hand
[39:32] just so he can look down and he can see
[39:35] that you're willing to raise that hand

[42:55] I want to say good evening
[42:58] tonight we're going to continue our
[43:00] study in the book of Acts
[43:02] and it's my privilege
[43:05] and responsibility
[43:07] to share with you this evening that
[43:09] before we dig into Acts
[43:12] I'd like to share a song with you
[43:14] that I've learned
[43:16] Back in 1970
[43:20] that summer
[43:22] myself
[43:23] brother Francois lipicard of Switzerland
[43:26] and brother John Simon of Guyana
[43:29] all piled onto the bench seat of my Ford
[43:31] pickup truck
[43:33] we headed for a camp meeting just a bit
[43:35] west of Edmonton Alberta Canada
[43:38] we were bringing hundreds of message
[43:39] books and other materials to that
[43:41] meeting
[43:44] three young men packed together in a
[43:47] pickup truck
[43:48] in the middle of summer
[43:50] no air conditioning
[43:51] covering almost 2 000 miles of mostly
[43:55] not freeway
[43:56] stopping only for meals gasoline
[44:00] Francois and I switched off driving Duty
[44:03] John had no driver's license
[44:05] who could afford a hotel or motel we
[44:08] were pretty much they're poor you can
[44:10] imagine we smelled a bit ripe when we
[44:13] arrived in Edmonton
[44:15] the only other time we three have been
[44:17] together after that trip in the summer
[44:19] of 1970 was in the mid-1990s here in
[44:22] Tucson
[44:23] brother John on your right now pastors a
[44:26] church in Ontario
[44:28] brother Francois in the center pastors
[44:30] the church in Switzerland
[44:33] anyway brother John taught us a song
[44:35] that summer and it's applicable to Acts
[44:38] including chapter six which is our
[44:40] chapter for tonight it tells about Peter
[44:43] and John two of the Apostles we've read
[44:45] about so far
[44:47] and it introduces Stephen
[44:49] a primary focus for acts chapters six
[44:53] and seven you may have heard some
[44:55] version of the song it's called almost
[44:57] home if you know it please sing it with
[45:01] me if you don't know it please learn it
[45:03] with me and sing
[45:05] laughs they took the Apostle Peter and
[45:10] beat him more and on but he would not
[45:14] deny the Lord as he had done before they
[45:19] hung him by his feet to die they thought
[45:22] he was alone but he cried out unto the
[45:27] Lord I'm almost home
[45:31] almost home
[45:34] almost home I've got a mansion waiting
[45:39] and I'm almost home
[45:43] almost home
[45:46] almost home I've got a mansion waiting
[45:51] and I'm almost home they took the
[45:56] Apostle John out put him on an Isle to
[45:59] die but he had a great connection with
[46:04] the Lord up in the sky he saw the New
[46:08] Jerusalem they thought he was alone but
[46:13] he said it's not so hard to die when you
[46:17] can't see your home
[46:19] almost home
[46:22] almost home I've got a mansion waiting
[46:27] and I'm almost home
[46:32] almost home
[46:35] almost home I've got a mansion waiting
[46:40] and I'm almost home and now a verse
[46:44] you've probably not heard before
[46:47] even full of faith and power the Holy
[46:50] Ghost also
[46:52] he would not deny the Lord his time had
[46:57] come to go they beat him and they stoned
[47:01] him till his life was almost gone but he
[47:06] looked up to heaven and said oh Lord I'm
[47:09] coming home
[47:11] almost home let's make it plural almost
[47:15] home include those around you we've got
[47:18] a mansion waiting and we're almost home
[47:23] almost home
[47:27] almost home we've got a mansion waiting
[47:32] and we're almost home
[47:37] thank you so much
[47:38] [Applause]
[47:41] I'm excited to be with you this evening
[47:45] act six is a short chapter it's only
[47:48] about 15 verses but it contains lessons
[47:51] for us almost 20 centuries later
[47:55] before we read let's stand once more and
[47:59] invite the Lord once again
[48:02] to be here guide whatever is said that
[48:05] it would suit his Divine purposes Lord
[48:08] Jesus we're truly grateful we're honored
[48:12] we're privileged to be here this evening
[48:15] each one of us and the company of our
[48:17] brothers and sisters and cousins and
[48:20] Lord we just pray Lord that your spirit
[48:23] would continue to move in our midst
[48:24] because we feel your presence here the
[48:26] atmosphere has been set Lord help me
[48:30] Lord to be yielded to you Lord that
[48:32] people wouldn't hear Lyle Johnson
[48:34] because he's got nothing worth hearing
[48:36] but that we would hear from you that
[48:38] you'd meet needs and lives that you'd
[48:40] answer questions and hearts Lord that
[48:43] you draw us closer together and should
[48:44] help us Lord to see the book of Acts as
[48:47] a living book it's alive in our hearts
[48:49] today Lord and Lord we're so grateful
[48:52] that we can know you in this hour we
[48:54] commit the remainder of this service to
[48:56] you now and we thank you for your mercy
[48:59] and your grace your love your kindness
[49:02] your forgiveness we ask it and we thank
[49:05] you in Jesus name amen
[49:10] amen while we're standing
[49:12] please open your Bibles to Deuteronomy
[49:16] chapter 26.
[49:18] we'll read there first then we'll skip
[49:21] to Nehemiah chapter 13. both his
[49:25] background for Acts chapter 6. since
[49:29] it's a Bible study please use your Bible
[49:31] or the one in the seat holder that's in
[49:33] front of you
[49:36] the context for the first scripture is
[49:39] an instruction from Moses or through
[49:41] Moses to the Israelites as they were
[49:43] still in the desert about an action that
[49:46] they were to take after they entered the
[49:49] land of promise and acts we're dealing
[49:52] with a diverse group that has just come
[49:54] to Faith in Jesus Christ the scripture
[49:57] here is dealing with sharing their
[50:00] bounty
[50:01] Deuteronomy 26 verse 11 and thou shalt
[50:04] rejoice in every good thing which the
[50:07] Lord thy God hath given unto thee
[50:11] like his Amazing Grace as we just sang
[50:14] and unto thine house thou and the levite
[50:18] and this stranger that is among you when
[50:20] thou has made an end of tithing all the
[50:23] tithes of thine increase the third year
[50:25] which is the year of tithing and has
[50:28] given it unto the levite
[50:31] the stranger the fatherless and the
[50:34] Widow why that they may eat within thy
[50:38] Gates
[50:39] and be filled
[50:41] here we see the taking care of strangers
[50:43] widows orphans it's a requirement
[50:46] we're also familiar with the Commandment
[50:48] to perform an incomplete Harvest so the
[50:51] poor May glean the fields we see the
[50:53] importance of that when we read the book
[50:54] of Ruth
[50:55] it's all about sharing
[50:57] and acts we've read the believer's had
[51:00] all things in common
[51:02] sharing
[51:03] next we read from Nehemiah 13 verse 12.
[51:08] then brought all Judah the tithe of the
[51:10] Corn that corn that doesn't mean what we
[51:13] think of this this yellow stuff that we
[51:15] use in foods that we eat it's talking
[51:18] about grain it's talking about barley
[51:20] and it's talking about wheat corn simply
[51:22] means kernel it means grain
[51:24] the tithe of the Grain and new wine and
[51:27] oil unto the treasuries and I as
[51:30] Nehemiah he's the appointed governor of
[51:33] the territory he says I made treasurers
[51:35] over the treasuries
[51:38] shalimaya the priest and zadok the
[51:41] Scribe and of the Levites padaya and
[51:44] next to them was Hanan the son of the
[51:46] zakur the son of matanaya for they were
[51:49] counted faithful and their office was to
[51:53] distribute unto their brethren
[51:56] here we see that specific responsibility
[51:59] for the distribution of these
[52:01] agricultural products was assigned the
[52:04] context is that it had not been properly
[52:06] collected or distributed prior to
[52:08] nehemiah's intervention we'll see the
[52:10] parallel in Acts chapter 6. please be
[52:14] seated
[52:17] let's pause a moment and recap what we
[52:21] read in acts so far in chapter 1 Jesus
[52:25] ascends there's a small group of some
[52:28] 120 Believers waiting in Jerusalem
[52:30] they'd been promised the baptism of the
[52:32] Holy Spirit to give them power to be
[52:34] witnesses to Jesus Christ I'm sure they
[52:37] were uncertain what that exactly meant
[52:40] or how it would manifest itself
[52:42] meanwhile the 11 disciples appointed
[52:46] Matthias to replace Judas Iscariot and
[52:49] bring their number back to 12. chapter 2
[52:52] recorded the first in filling of the
[52:54] spirit on Pentecost
[52:57] they may not have accurately anticipated
[52:59] what it would be but they had no doubt
[53:02] when it happened
[53:03] Peter's first sermon to the crowd
[53:05] gathered near David's tomb
[53:08] the formula repent be baptized in the
[53:11] name of Jesus Christ receive the Holy
[53:14] Spirit was first summarized
[53:17] we we hear that there are three thousand
[53:19] that were added to their number
[53:22] and it's also the first mention of
[53:24] having things in common
[53:26] sharing Acts 3 and related to miraculous
[53:30] very public healing of a lame beggar
[53:34] through Peter and John
[53:36] for decades he's been bigger unable to
[53:38] walk having severely deformed ankles and
[53:40] feet instantly made whole walking and
[53:43] leaping praising God
[53:46] the disturbance gave opportunity for
[53:48] Peter's second recorded sermon this time
[53:50] in Solomon's Colonnade within the temple
[53:53] area
[53:54] acts 4
[53:56] told her the overnight Detention of
[53:58] Peter and John and it appears the beggar
[54:01] some five thousand are added as a result
[54:03] of Peter's interrupted sermon
[54:06] Peter and John are threatened and
[54:08] released
[54:09] the Believers hear this report these
[54:11] threatens
[54:12] and their response is to pray for
[54:14] boldness
[54:15] and God's response is the second
[54:17] infilling of the Holy Spirit the
[54:19] building is shaken
[54:21] the second mention of things being in
[54:24] common and it introduces Barnabas
[54:27] which gives us a background for Paul's
[54:28] first stop in his first missionary
[54:30] journey that we'll talk about when we
[54:31] get to Acts 13.
[54:34] acts 5 which Pastor Daniel taught from
[54:37] last Sunday evening recorded the death
[54:39] of ananias and his wife
[54:42] they don't lie dying they die lying
[54:46] further miracles of healing and
[54:49] spreading of the Faith by the apostles
[54:51] the second arrest of Peter and other
[54:53] Apostles in their release a few hours
[54:55] later by an Angel
[54:57] they're found teaching in the temple the
[54:59] next morning and they're arrested for
[55:01] the third time
[55:02] the Sanhedrin Council seeks to kill them
[55:05] in order to silence them but Gamaliel
[55:08] intervenes
[55:10] instead they're flogged that means
[55:12] they're beaten with whips that tear the
[55:14] flesh
[55:15] further threatened
[55:17] and released
[55:19] they Rejoice that they can suffer for
[55:22] Christ
[55:23] let's turn now to act six starting at
[55:26] the first verse
[55:27] we read King James version in those days
[55:31] which days are these 24-hour periods are
[55:35] they 1 000 year Millennials or is it a
[55:38] more generic reference during these
[55:40] times I I think that's what it means and
[55:43] how do we determine which days these
[55:45] might be
[55:46] when the number of disciples was
[55:48] multiplied
[55:49] other translations read as a number of
[55:52] disciples was greatly increasing
[55:55] so we're looking at an early period of
[55:57] the church a time of rapid growth and
[56:00] numbers
[56:01] and these people
[56:03] are all self-sacrificing walking in
[56:06] complete unity all of One mind all of
[56:09] One Accord they're super Saints right
[56:11] right
[56:13] there were Rosa murmuring
[56:16] of the grecians
[56:18] against the Hebrews
[56:19] because their widows were neglected in
[56:22] the daily ministration
[56:25] [Music]
[56:26] um
[56:26] they're not super Saints
[56:29] ah I'm part of that group
[56:31] well this brings up several questions
[56:33] well who are the grecians or does that
[56:36] mean that they're Greeks they're
[56:37] gentiles
[56:39] who are the the Hebrews weren't they all
[56:42] Jewish at this time
[56:45] what does it mean when it says
[56:46] that kind of mumbling or
[56:49] what are daily
[56:51] that are the apparent reason for this
[56:53] murmuring in the first place
[56:56] some of this is slightly clarified in
[56:59] the following verses but I think it's
[57:01] more easily understood if we look to a
[57:03] different translation for this verse and
[57:05] the NIV it reads
[57:07] in those days when the number of
[57:10] disciples was increasing
[57:11] the Hellenistic Jews among them
[57:13] complained against the hebraic Jews
[57:16] because there the hellenists widows were
[57:19] being overlooked in the daily
[57:20] distribution of food
[57:24] huh
[57:25] so these are all Jewish people
[57:29] but some of them are Hellenistic
[57:31] whatever that means what what is meant
[57:34] by a Hellenistic Jew
[57:37] what we have here is a clash between
[57:40] cultures
[57:41] it here's a little background recall
[57:43] that Israel is a nation ceased to exist
[57:47] several hundred years prior and
[57:49] self-rule ended with the conquest of
[57:51] Judah around 586 BC
[57:55] well that may be a little hard to see
[57:57] but that's uh
[58:01] on the left side as you're facing it is
[58:03] the Mediterranean Egypt is below it this
[58:06] little tiny Speck here is Jerusalem this
[58:08] is Israel but this whole territory
[58:10] that's in color
[58:11] is an Alexander conquered
[58:15] so he conquered this territory by about
[58:18] 325 BC and he infused Greek culture into
[58:22] the conquered region
[58:24] language arts social values philosophy
[58:29] religion
[58:32] Under The Maccabees a brief period of
[58:35] Independence in in Israel what we think
[58:38] of is Israel and sued about 200 years
[58:40] before the events recorded in Acts the
[58:44] land we think of is Israel then became a
[58:46] vassal state to Rome
[58:48] and with Rome behind him Herod the Great
[58:50] and irumian seized control of the
[58:53] provinces of Judea Galilee and so forth
[58:57] part of the local Jewish population
[58:59] clung to the old ways and language
[59:01] although it is reported as Hebrew here
[59:03] was more likely Aramaic kind of a street
[59:06] Hebrew if you
[59:07] others adopted many Greek Customs Greek
[59:11] as a language was so widespread in that
[59:13] area that a Greek language translation
[59:16] of the Hebrew scriptures known as the
[59:18] Septuagint occurred during the third and
[59:20] second centuries BC under the ptolemies
[59:23] who ruled Egypt after the breakup of
[59:26] Alexander's Kingdom
[59:31] in fact you'll find that the scriptures
[59:33] quoted in the New Testament are from the
[59:35] Septuagint which differs in many places
[59:37] in minor ways from the Hebrew text
[59:40] this Greek or Hellenistic influence is
[59:43] widespread throughout the Eastern
[59:45] Mediterranean and what we now call the
[59:46] Middle East it had been for nearly 400
[59:49] years so the Hellenistic Jews were those
[59:52] who had lived under or embraced to some
[59:55] degree Greek language and culture
[59:59] the bottom line for Luke's purposes is
[1:00:01] that the hellenized Jews complained that
[1:00:03] the needy in their ranks were not being
[1:00:05] treated as equals with the
[1:00:06] non-hellonized and the distribution of
[1:00:08] relief
[1:00:09] there was division there was a schism
[1:00:14] one assumes it was the hebraic Jews that
[1:00:16] were administering the relief whatever
[1:00:18] it was food clothing money other forms
[1:00:20] of aided assistance we don't know if any
[1:00:23] of the apostles were involved directly
[1:00:26] we're not told where or how or how many
[1:00:29] how things were handled in general at
[1:00:31] this time is unclear we're just told
[1:00:34] they had things in common
[1:00:37] we do know that not everyone sold their
[1:00:39] homes it wasn't a commune as you might
[1:00:42] think of today we're reading in a later
[1:00:43] chapter about an event at John Mark's
[1:00:46] house for example
[1:00:47] finally it's interesting to note that
[1:00:50] the term disciple used in the gospel
[1:00:53] accounts to almost always mean the
[1:00:55] twelve is now being used by Luke
[1:00:58] to describe the general body of
[1:01:01] Believers all our now-term disciples
[1:01:04] which really means Learners or pupils
[1:01:06] we'd say students
[1:01:09] well let's go on to verse two
[1:01:12] we read then the 12 apostles called the
[1:01:15] multitude of disciples Believers unto
[1:01:18] them in other words they had a general
[1:01:20] congregational meeting
[1:01:23] and said it's not reason it's not
[1:01:26] reasonable it isn't appropriate it would
[1:01:28] not be right that we should leave
[1:01:30] neglect the ministry or the teaching or
[1:01:33] the preaching of the word of God and
[1:01:35] serve tables oversee the distribution of
[1:01:39] food
[1:01:40] run a food program
[1:01:43] these complaints had become such an
[1:01:45] issue that a meeting was called of
[1:01:48] everyone to settle the matter
[1:01:51] the apostles were not interested in
[1:01:53] being distracted by this they were
[1:01:55] filled with the Holy Spirit to be
[1:01:57] Proclaimers of Jesus's Messiah and they
[1:02:00] wanted to retain that Focus
[1:02:04] in verse 3 we read wherefore and so
[1:02:08] Brethren look ye Out Among you you
[1:02:11] choose from among yourselves seven men
[1:02:13] oh this suggests there were more than a
[1:02:16] few widows that were being neglected if
[1:02:18] to administer it properly would take
[1:02:20] seven men
[1:02:21] these seven men of honest report
[1:02:25] ethical honest whose trustworthiness you
[1:02:28] as a group recognize and accept
[1:02:32] and Beyond simply being honest they must
[1:02:35] each be recognized as being full of the
[1:02:38] Holy Ghost
[1:02:39] full
[1:02:40] not just a little not just a taste but
[1:02:44] full of the holy spirit and wisdom
[1:02:47] wisdom so they can deal with human
[1:02:50] frailties and emotions
[1:02:53] see below the surface
[1:02:55] whom we may appoint
[1:02:58] you'll select them but they will become
[1:03:00] our Representatives with our full
[1:03:02] Authority behind them to be put in
[1:03:05] charge of this Duty over this business
[1:03:08] but we 12 Apostles will give ourselves
[1:03:12] continually
[1:03:13] spend our time exclusively in prayer and
[1:03:17] to the ministry the teaching and
[1:03:20] preaching of the word the gospel the
[1:03:22] good news that Jesus is the Messiah who
[1:03:25] brings eternal life to those who accept
[1:03:28] him
[1:03:31] the saying the direction given by the
[1:03:34] apostles pleased the whole multitude
[1:03:36] that's the multitude of Believers
[1:03:39] including those who are murmuring
[1:03:42] and they the Believers at large chose
[1:03:45] the following seven individuals we're
[1:03:48] not told the means or the methods that
[1:03:50] they use to select these seven
[1:03:53] but they were Stephen
[1:03:55] a man full of faith and of the Holy
[1:03:58] Ghost
[1:03:59] and Philip is not the Apostle but
[1:04:02] another the same name
[1:04:04] and pro-chorus and nikonur and Timon
[1:04:09] and parminus
[1:04:11] and Nicholas across the light of Antioch
[1:04:14] a proslight in this case simply means
[1:04:16] that he was a person who converted to
[1:04:18] the Jewish faith so we assume he was a
[1:04:19] pagan
[1:04:21] he became a Jew he from Antioch he went
[1:04:24] down to Jerusalem and now he has been
[1:04:27] converted and he is a Christian and he
[1:04:29] is risen in the ranks to the point where
[1:04:31] people respect and trust him and he's
[1:04:34] filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:04:36] we see that the congregation
[1:04:39] was pleased with this proposed solution
[1:04:42] to the problem
[1:04:44] then they the body of believers who were
[1:04:47] all converts from the Jewish faith
[1:04:49] this had an ordained hierarchy of high
[1:04:52] priests and Priests and Levites from the
[1:04:55] time of Moses some 1500 years before
[1:04:58] they were accustomed to this sort of
[1:05:01] thing it was in their DNA we might say
[1:05:04] what we see here
[1:05:06] is a formal division
[1:05:08] of Labor or responsibility
[1:05:11] the beginnings of a church hierarchy
[1:05:15] this may well have been a seed planted
[1:05:18] which later allowed the spirit of the
[1:05:21] Nicolaitans to take authority in the
[1:05:24] first church age Revelation 2 6 but this
[1:05:26] thou Hast that thou hate us the Deeds of
[1:05:28] the Nicolaitans which I also hate
[1:05:33] the church is changing from a body of
[1:05:36] believers to one that consists of
[1:05:39] Apostles and pastors and Bishops and
[1:05:41] overseers and deacons and so forth It's
[1:05:44] a process that begins it takes time this
[1:05:48] kind of organization or structure is not
[1:05:50] necessarily evil in fact it's often
[1:05:53] necessary
[1:05:55] but the great Danger
[1:05:57] is that it can condition people to
[1:06:00] substitute a hierarchy of human
[1:06:02] authority and assigned responsibility
[1:06:06] in place of an intimate relationship
[1:06:08] with the holy spirit to guide and direct
[1:06:10] and reveal
[1:06:12] we must all be vigilant to not fall into
[1:06:16] such a trap brother Aaron has shared
[1:06:18] with us and he was sitting back there
[1:06:19] and he would look at his password if his
[1:06:21] Pastor raised his hand he'd raise his
[1:06:23] hand if the Pastor said amen he'd say
[1:06:25] amen and then the Lord told him that
[1:06:27] man's not your Holy Ghost
[1:06:29] we need to have that relationship with
[1:06:32] the Holy Spirit
[1:06:34] well back to verse 5 if you look at this
[1:06:37] list of names Stephen Phillip prokary
[1:06:40] Smith
[1:06:41] you'll notice these are not Greek forms
[1:06:43] of Hebrew names like Jeremy for Jeremiah
[1:06:45] or isaiahs for Isaiah or Elias for
[1:06:49] Elijah these are Greek names
[1:06:52] the seven chosen men appear to be of the
[1:06:54] hellenized group
[1:06:56] none of them have hebraic name
[1:07:00] okay so whom they said before the
[1:07:03] apostles in other words the congregation
[1:07:05] brought the seven before the apostles
[1:07:07] and when the apostles had prayed the
[1:07:09] apostles laid their hands on the seven
[1:07:13] and it's the last we hear of the problem
[1:07:17] laying on of hands it's a very Jewish
[1:07:20] thing to do
[1:07:21] having contact or at least it was at
[1:07:24] this time
[1:07:28] James a leader of the Jewish segment of
[1:07:31] the early church advises laying hands
[1:07:33] and anointing with oil
[1:07:36] and the apostles are all converts from
[1:07:39] Judaism in fact they don't see
[1:07:41] themselves as not being Jew
[1:07:44] this will become a big controversy in a
[1:07:47] few chapters when Peter and Cornelius
[1:07:49] meet
[1:07:50] God moves the spirit fills some
[1:07:52] non-jewish people that accept the gospel
[1:07:54] message
[1:07:55] it will also guide the later Jerusalem
[1:07:58] Council in Acts chapter 15 regarding
[1:08:01] Gentile believers
[1:08:03] who set certain rules to ensure that
[1:08:05] they'll be accepted to enter Jewish
[1:08:08] synagogues to hear the reading of the of
[1:08:11] the word the Tanakh the Torah the Bible
[1:08:13] of the day what we call the Old
[1:08:14] Testament
[1:08:15] understand that the synagogues were the
[1:08:18] only way that a follower of Jesus could
[1:08:21] hear the word to hear it read whether in
[1:08:25] Hebrew or Greek there were no Bibles
[1:08:28] skulls are outrageously expensive and
[1:08:30] most people were not able to read
[1:08:34] my friends
[1:08:37] literacy
[1:08:38] which is so common in our world today
[1:08:42] is a great gift
[1:08:44] of our society
[1:08:46] end of our times
[1:08:48] similarly inexpensive Bibles in
[1:08:50] abundance or or free downloads to our
[1:08:54] smartphones and computers
[1:08:56] leave us no excuse
[1:08:58] to be unfamiliar
[1:09:00] with its contents Luke tells us in his
[1:09:03] gospel quoting Jesus in Luke 12 48 he
[1:09:06] says from everyone who has been given
[1:09:09] much
[1:09:10] will be demanded
[1:09:13] and from the one who has been entrusted
[1:09:16] with much
[1:09:17] much more will be asked
[1:09:23] verse 7. the word of God the gospel
[1:09:27] message that Jesus is the Messiah
[1:09:30] increased it kept spreading the number
[1:09:34] of the disciples multiplied increased in
[1:09:36] Jerusalem greatly
[1:09:38] and a great company a large number of
[1:09:40] the priests were obedient to the faith
[1:09:44] I I wonder when I read that what a
[1:09:47] conundrum that must have been for a
[1:09:49] priest to be offering a sacrifice at the
[1:09:52] temple but he's a Christian he's
[1:09:54] accepted Jesus as his Messiah as his
[1:09:57] sacrifice but he's offering this a
[1:10:01] I it would have been interesting to talk
[1:10:04] to one of these fellows and find out how
[1:10:06] they dealt with this
[1:10:09] well I I note that in some of my Bibles
[1:10:13] you've probably notice it in yours is
[1:10:16] this heading of of this chapter six it
[1:10:18] says that this group of seven are
[1:10:20] sometimes called the first deacons I
[1:10:23] don't know if you've noticed that in
[1:10:24] your Bible I said my Scofield bible
[1:10:28] it's not in the text we didn't read
[1:10:30] anything about Deacons
[1:10:33] and in fact if you do a search you'll
[1:10:36] find that the word Deacon only appears
[1:10:39] twice in the Bible
[1:10:41] twice
[1:10:43] I'm talking about English of course and
[1:10:46] that both times in first Timothy 3 where
[1:10:48] Paul is telling about the qualifications
[1:10:50] for a deacon
[1:10:53] it's interesting that he talks about the
[1:10:55] qualifications but not the duties
[1:10:58] so
[1:11:00] why are these seven
[1:11:02] so often referred to as the first
[1:11:04] Deacons
[1:11:07] well the word Deacon is not used in the
[1:11:10] text the word translated as serve like
[1:11:13] we just read in verse two about serving
[1:11:15] tables is the same Greek word
[1:11:19] diacaneo which means to wait upon
[1:11:22] menially as a host or friend to minister
[1:11:25] unto to serve and and this Greek word
[1:11:29] diacaneo occurs 37 times
[1:11:33] in 32 verses in the New Testament it's
[1:11:37] translated Deacon only in first Timothy
[1:11:39] 3.
[1:11:41] and it's the only word that's translated
[1:11:43] as deacon
[1:11:45] the qualifications if you read first
[1:11:47] Timothy 3 mirror what the apostles laid
[1:11:51] out here in verse 3.
[1:11:53] diaconao is more often translated as
[1:11:56] Minister it's translated this way in
[1:11:59] Corinthians Hebrews find amen first
[1:12:01] Peter and it's the very word translated
[1:12:04] as ministered when describing the women
[1:12:07] who ministered to Jesus and the
[1:12:09] disciples in all four gospels makes me
[1:12:14] wonder if maybe they were the first
[1:12:15] Deacons
[1:12:16] not formally of course these seven were
[1:12:19] the first in that sense but in other
[1:12:22] words these are people who render
[1:12:25] service regarding physical needs within
[1:12:27] the assembly
[1:12:30] I can't help but recall what we've read
[1:12:32] so far the words of Jesus
[1:12:35] again re record reported by Luke in Luke
[1:12:38] 22 verse 24. we read there was also a
[1:12:43] Strife a Strife this is this is an
[1:12:47] argument this is a fight Strife is a
[1:12:49] stronger word than for example they've
[1:12:52] had a gentle discussion it was Strife
[1:12:55] among the 12 disciples
[1:12:57] about which of them should be accounted
[1:13:01] the greatest
[1:13:03] hmm
[1:13:04] this is not the first time that this
[1:13:06] argument broke out
[1:13:07] but now as at the very end of Jesus
[1:13:11] ministry
[1:13:12] and they still don't get it
[1:13:15] so Jesus said unto them
[1:13:19] the kings are the Gentiles exercise
[1:13:21] lordship over the gentile people and and
[1:13:25] they that exercise this Authority upon
[1:13:27] them are called benefactors
[1:13:32] benefactor the word here it means a
[1:13:34] worker of good a philanthropist a a
[1:13:37] friend of the people
[1:13:40] using irony with this label he might
[1:13:42] have done air quotes just as I did
[1:13:44] around that word pilate certainly was
[1:13:46] not Jesus benefactor
[1:13:49] nor was Nero Paul's benefactor
[1:13:52] I suspect the disciples likely laughed
[1:13:55] at this description just like tell Herod
[1:13:57] that fox
[1:14:00] but
[1:14:02] however when the laughter stopped who's
[1:14:05] got their attention again he says ye
[1:14:08] shall not be so
[1:14:10] but instead he that is greatest among
[1:14:13] you that's what you think you want to be
[1:14:16] your role model is incorrect don't think
[1:14:19] like the Gentiles don't think like the
[1:14:21] Heathen rather let him be as the younger
[1:14:25] and he that is Chief rather than
[1:14:28] exercise some sort of lordship
[1:14:31] because he that doth serve
[1:14:34] there's that same word again diacaneo
[1:14:37] here is serve
[1:14:39] the disciples must have looked at each
[1:14:41] other when he said this
[1:14:44] for weather which who is greater the one
[1:14:47] that sits at the table to eat
[1:14:49] or the one that serves the one who is
[1:14:52] seated is not he that sitteth at me but
[1:14:56] around guys wake up I am among you
[1:15:00] as he that serveth
[1:15:03] there's that word again diacaneos twice
[1:15:06] in verse 27.
[1:15:09] well moving on in Acts Luke now leaves
[1:15:13] the issue of solving the distribution
[1:15:14] problem it's not mentioned again
[1:15:17] we read Stephen
[1:15:19] full of faith and power did great
[1:15:22] wonders and miracles among the people
[1:15:26] and I don't think that this was handing
[1:15:29] out food
[1:15:30] it's not serving tables in other words
[1:15:32] Stephen is doing the same work as the
[1:15:35] apostles who didn't want to serve tables
[1:15:37] and I don't mean that disrespectfully
[1:15:40] frankly I find it mildly amusing but we
[1:15:43] all need to recognize that we're in a
[1:15:46] different place in our walk with Christ
[1:15:49] we can't judge others based on where we
[1:15:52] think way we are or where we think that
[1:15:55] someone else should be
[1:15:56] we are all imperfect people Works in
[1:16:01] progress on a life Journey via the Cross
[1:16:05] of Christ to our eventual transition
[1:16:09] from physical life
[1:16:12] as brother Daniel spoke on Sunday a
[1:16:14] newborn baby doesn't walk doesn't eat
[1:16:17] solid food
[1:16:18] some are born quietly some are born less
[1:16:22] quietly
[1:16:23] there's growth involved I shared a bit
[1:16:27] in Sister Angela's class before Sunday
[1:16:29] school with two of her students about
[1:16:30] growth that someday the little girl
[1:16:33] sitting at the craft table would be a
[1:16:36] full-grown woman like her mommy
[1:16:38] but that's a process
[1:16:39] it takes time
[1:16:42] it reminds me of another song when I
[1:16:44] learned from Brother Francois also in
[1:16:47] 1970. don't worry I'm not going to sink
[1:16:51] this song basically says read your Bible
[1:16:54] and pray every day if you want to grow
[1:16:58] he taught it to me in French and then
[1:17:00] translated it to English we used to sing
[1:17:02] it quite often
[1:17:04] in any event we now see Stephen doing
[1:17:07] the work as an apostle a work of an
[1:17:10] evangelist
[1:17:13] I can't help but think of my youth
[1:17:15] I I was so excited when NASA announced
[1:17:19] the first Seven astronauts the Mercury
[1:17:22] Seven in 1959 I was nine years old
[1:17:28] I memorized their names
[1:17:30] committed their photographs to memory
[1:17:32] admired their spacesuits I was euphoric
[1:17:36] When Alan Shepard launched into space
[1:17:37] for a few minutes
[1:17:39] soon after I turned 11.
[1:17:42] and when John Glenn orbited the Earth 10
[1:17:45] minutes later a couple of weeks after I
[1:17:47] turned 12.
[1:17:48] everyone talked about those events my
[1:17:51] friends at school my parents snatches of
[1:17:54] conversation overheard in random places
[1:17:58] the second group of astronauts weren't
[1:18:00] nearly as instantly famous their names
[1:18:03] not quite as impactful when they were
[1:18:06] announced
[1:18:07] they were known as the next nine were or
[1:18:09] the new nine and selected in 1962 but
[1:18:13] several months after John Glenn's
[1:18:15] mission
[1:18:17] but among this group
[1:18:19] was Frank Borman raised in Tucson he
[1:18:22] became famous for publicly reading from
[1:18:25] the Genesis creation account in the
[1:18:26] Bible while orbiting the moon as
[1:18:28] commander of Apollo 8 in December 1968.
[1:18:33] Neil Armstrong
[1:18:34] commander of Apollo 11 the first human
[1:18:37] to walk on the moon
[1:18:42] two names
[1:18:44] many of us recognize
[1:18:46] so we had both the Mercury Seven and the
[1:18:50] new nine and the astronaut core
[1:18:53] and in the New Testament in Acts six we
[1:18:55] have the 12 apostles and then this
[1:18:57] second group of men whose names we just
[1:18:59] read
[1:19:00] the second group became known as the
[1:19:03] seven but we'll see this when we get to
[1:19:05] Acts 21.
[1:19:07] and like the new nine astronauts there
[1:19:10] are two names that stand out from this
[1:19:12] second group
[1:19:13] Stephen and Philip
[1:19:16] we're now looking at Stephen Philip will
[1:19:19] come along in Acts chapter 8.
[1:19:22] well back to acts six
[1:19:25] verse 9.
[1:19:27] then there arose certain of the
[1:19:30] synagogue which is called the synagogue
[1:19:32] of The Libertines at the translations
[1:19:34] read there arose certain of the freedmen
[1:19:37] as it was called or of the free Jewish
[1:19:40] slaves as it was called
[1:19:42] and the membership of the synagogue
[1:19:45] included cyrenians I'm sure would I put
[1:19:48] up that map you all zeroed in on a
[1:19:49] little spot on North Africa and Tanya
[1:19:51] appointment said Cyrene so you know
[1:19:53] where that is right if I say it's like
[1:19:55] Tunisia or Libya probably still will
[1:19:57] give me a blank look but that's all
[1:19:59] right
[1:20:00] sirenians and alexandrians those are
[1:20:03] from Egypt North Africa and also
[1:20:05] included men of them of cilicia and Asia
[1:20:08] this is
[1:20:09] parts of what we now call Turkey
[1:20:11] and they were disputing
[1:20:13] with Stephen
[1:20:15] disputing is a pretty strong word
[1:20:18] disputing has a negative connotation and
[1:20:21] modern usage
[1:20:22] the Greek conveys the sense of reasoning
[1:20:25] discussing questioning
[1:20:28] What's Happening Here is exactly how
[1:20:30] Paul and others carried the gospel in
[1:20:33] one convert says we'll read in later
[1:20:35] chapters in Acts
[1:20:37] remember
[1:20:38] there were two primary sects within
[1:20:41] Judaism at this time the Pharisees and
[1:20:44] the Sadducees the Sadducees were very
[1:20:46] strict conservative they ran the temple
[1:20:49] they dominated the Sanhedrin Council as
[1:20:51] well
[1:20:52] Pharisees on the other hand were more
[1:20:55] liberal focused on the word that the
[1:20:57] Scrolls the writings how to apply them
[1:20:59] to daily life
[1:21:01] they were all about rules
[1:21:03] they were not focused so much on the
[1:21:05] temple in its ritual Jesus had many
[1:21:07] discussions with the Pharisees
[1:21:10] the gospel accounts often portray the
[1:21:12] Pharisees as being insincere trying to
[1:21:15] trip Jesus up in his own words certainly
[1:21:17] it's true in some and perhaps even most
[1:21:20] cases
[1:21:23] but this was how Pharisees learned
[1:21:25] that's how rabbis learned today when
[1:21:27] when a young child is put into Yeshiva
[1:21:30] to study the the Bible the Torah the
[1:21:32] writings they're paired so that they can
[1:21:35] argue back and forth so they can test
[1:21:37] each other so they can they can drive
[1:21:39] things in a little deeper they don't
[1:21:41] just listen to the teacher droning on
[1:21:43] and on but they have discussions amongst
[1:21:45] themselves
[1:21:49] so debate is always encouraged staking
[1:21:53] out defending positions interpretations
[1:21:55] probing for weaknesses
[1:21:57] and Mark's account of the man asking
[1:21:59] Jesus about the greatest commandment
[1:22:02] Jesus is sympathetic tells the man he's
[1:22:04] not far from the kingdom of God but in
[1:22:07] Matthew's account of the same
[1:22:08] conversation the Pharisee is almost
[1:22:10] portrayed as an enemy
[1:22:13] the King James version uses the word
[1:22:16] tempted which and in our uses is a
[1:22:19] pejorative it has a negative connotation
[1:22:22] but a better word today might be tested
[1:22:24] to to scrutinize examine objectively
[1:22:27] inquire understand the basis of the
[1:22:30] statement or the position
[1:22:32] well in this case we'll see that these
[1:22:34] men debating with Stephen became
[1:22:37] frustrated decided to keep up
[1:22:39] appearances by cheating
[1:22:42] thus their discussion became disputing
[1:22:47] verse 10 and they these folks from this
[1:22:51] synagogue of The Libertines were not
[1:22:53] able to resist to overcome to refute the
[1:22:56] wisdom and the Spirit by which Stephen
[1:23:00] spake a lot of times if you're listening
[1:23:03] to some of the messages of brother
[1:23:04] Branham you can feel the spirit in which
[1:23:06] he's saying things and that carries
[1:23:08] oftentimes as much or more weight than
[1:23:10] the words that he says
[1:23:13] so these folks they were unwilling to
[1:23:16] convert they were unwilling to concede
[1:23:19] so
[1:23:22] they suborned men what does suborned
[1:23:25] means it means to secretly persuade not
[1:23:27] not in public views go behind persons
[1:23:30] back they support they induce men which
[1:23:33] said oh oh oh we've heard Stephen speak
[1:23:38] Blasphemous words impious just
[1:23:41] respectful words against Moses and
[1:23:43] against God
[1:23:46] and they this aborned man along with
[1:23:49] those who would support them
[1:23:51] stirred up the people
[1:23:53] so they didn't just say this once and
[1:23:55] then went home
[1:23:56] and the elders
[1:23:58] and the scribes
[1:24:00] and Came Upon Stephen who wasn't hiding
[1:24:04] and caught the word who caught it means
[1:24:07] they They seized him they snatched him
[1:24:10] and they brought him to the council
[1:24:13] now this is the same Council
[1:24:16] that had Peter and others flogged in
[1:24:18] chapter four
[1:24:20] and had no compunctions about
[1:24:22] brutalizing people who disagreed with
[1:24:24] them
[1:24:25] or from whom they felt threatened in
[1:24:28] their positions
[1:24:30] and the the men who couldn't withstand
[1:24:33] Stephen's arguments set up false
[1:24:36] Witnesses you'll see this phrase in the
[1:24:38] King James frequently false Witnesses
[1:24:41] just think Liars
[1:24:44] they set up Liars
[1:24:46] and and by doing that they're violating
[1:24:49] the very law that they claim to follow
[1:24:52] and defend
[1:24:53] the ninth of the Ten Commandments Exodus
[1:24:56] 2016 Thou shalt not bear false witness
[1:24:59] against thy neighbor
[1:25:01] and and there's a price to pay for
[1:25:04] bearing false Witnesses it's detailed in
[1:25:06] Deuteronomy 19 but the gist of it is if
[1:25:09] you come and lie about something
[1:25:12] about your neighbor and the expected
[1:25:15] result of that is that he's going to be
[1:25:17] punished in some way maybe pay a fine or
[1:25:19] be put to death if it's discovered that
[1:25:21] you're lying you will be subject to that
[1:25:24] same fine or that same death
[1:25:27] this is very serious in the law and the
[1:25:31] rules if you obey them
[1:25:36] so they had these false Witnesses which
[1:25:39] said this man ceases not to speak
[1:25:41] Blasphemous words in other words
[1:25:43] Steven's constantly saying Blasphemous
[1:25:45] words against this holy place
[1:25:49] oh
[1:25:50] the temple
[1:25:51] offending the Sadducees
[1:25:54] and the law
[1:25:56] the written word of God
[1:25:58] thus offending the Pharisees these are
[1:26:00] the two groups whose leadership comprise
[1:26:02] the council this these lies were
[1:26:04] targeted specifically to enrage that
[1:26:07] Council
[1:26:09] for we have heard him say that this
[1:26:12] Jesus of Nazareth what these guys are
[1:26:15] probably talking in the name of Jesus of
[1:26:17] Nazis his very counsel has forbidden
[1:26:19] that to happen
[1:26:21] so now if they're calling into question
[1:26:23] the authority of the council
[1:26:25] and shall destroy this place
[1:26:28] loosen up Sadducees
[1:26:30] and shall change the Customs which Moses
[1:26:32] delivered us you got that Pharisees
[1:26:37] this is such blatant hypocrisy
[1:26:40] by the council you know
[1:26:43] you may be surprised but I found a
[1:26:45] picture of the council
[1:26:47] the court
[1:26:49] and the lying witnesses that Stephen
[1:26:51] faced that day
[1:26:52] let me show it to you
[1:26:57] the kangaroo court is is a proceeding
[1:26:59] and its leaders who are considered sham
[1:27:03] corrupt and without regard
[1:27:06] for the law
[1:27:08] this isn't in Moscow this is in
[1:27:10] Jerusalem this is his Council recall the
[1:27:13] high priest the chief judge is sitting
[1:27:15] here ananias and Caiaphas were the very
[1:27:18] ones that had sought lying testimony
[1:27:23] false witnesses to destroy Jesus
[1:27:27] they knew the game they were playing
[1:27:28] with Jesus life and now with the life of
[1:27:30] Stephen they had no respect for the law
[1:27:33] they imposed on everyone else justifying
[1:27:36] their own sin as being for the greater
[1:27:39] good
[1:27:41] note Stephen is facing the very same
[1:27:45] accusation as Jesus
[1:27:47] before the same Council
[1:27:50] the same judges
[1:27:52] Matthew 26 57 we read and they that had
[1:27:57] laid hold on Jesus the soldiers of the
[1:27:59] guards led by Judas is carried and
[1:28:01] Gethsemane
[1:28:03] Let Jesus away to Caiaphas
[1:28:06] the same Caiaphas the high priest where
[1:28:09] the scribes and Elders were assembled
[1:28:13] but Peter followed him afar off unto the
[1:28:15] high priest's Palace
[1:28:17] Palace
[1:28:19] what a contrast and went in and sat with
[1:28:23] the servants to see the end now the
[1:28:25] chief priests and elders and all the
[1:28:28] council
[1:28:31] the chief priests and the elders and all
[1:28:35] the council sought false witness
[1:28:38] against Jesus
[1:28:40] put him to death
[1:28:43] Deuteronomy 19 says all of those guys
[1:28:46] should have suffered a death penalty as
[1:28:48] a result they they found none yet though
[1:28:51] many false Witnesses came yet they found
[1:28:53] none at last came to liars and said this
[1:28:58] fellow said I am able to destroy the
[1:29:00] temple of God and build it in three days
[1:29:04] and the high priest arose and said to
[1:29:06] Jesus answer thou nothing
[1:29:09] what is it which he's witness against
[1:29:10] thee
[1:29:12] Jesus held his peace
[1:29:15] back to Acts 6.
[1:29:18] and all that sat on the council
[1:29:21] for hearing this false testimony looking
[1:29:25] steadfastly intently fastening their
[1:29:28] eyes on Stephen
[1:29:30] so his face is his countenance his
[1:29:33] appearances demeanor as it had been that
[1:29:35] of an Angel
[1:29:41] there are no explanations of what this
[1:29:43] means the face of an Angel what
[1:29:46] no other examples and Acts or elsewhere
[1:29:49] that I could find that deal with what
[1:29:52] the face of an Angel might look like or
[1:29:55] what the expression might mean
[1:29:58] brother Branham clarifies it
[1:30:00] he tells us in four different sermons it
[1:30:03] doesn't mean that he glowed it doesn't
[1:30:05] mean that a beam of light came down from
[1:30:07] heaven and illuminated him it simply
[1:30:10] means he was a messenger he was
[1:30:12] displaying complete confidence
[1:30:14] absolutely certain of what he said
[1:30:18] he was unshakable
[1:30:22] and verse 7
[1:30:24] it starts out then
[1:30:27] said the high priest to Stephen
[1:30:30] are these things so that you said this
[1:30:33] Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this
[1:30:35] place and change the Customs Moses
[1:30:37] delivered to us
[1:30:40] and Stephen said men
[1:30:43] Brethren and fathers
[1:30:46] hearken listen to what I'm going to tell
[1:30:49] you please musicians come to your
[1:30:51] instruments
[1:30:56] yeah we're going to stop here
[1:31:00] you want to find out what happened
[1:31:01] you're going to have to come and hear
[1:31:03] our Pastor Daniel tell you what happened
[1:31:05] in Acts chapter 7 because we've just run
[1:31:08] out of chapter six
[1:31:10] but but in closing
[1:31:13] remember what Jesus said about greatness
[1:31:16] about service
[1:31:18] that we'd be known by our fruits
[1:31:22] by our love
[1:31:24] the people we find in acts are no
[1:31:27] different than we are
[1:31:29] we're told thousands upon thousands were
[1:31:32] added to the ranks of the Believers
[1:31:34] but we're not told very many names
[1:31:37] just because a person's name only
[1:31:39] appears once or twice don't assume it
[1:31:42] means they fell out of fellowship or
[1:31:44] abandoned the faith
[1:31:45] Luke's trying to tell certain things to
[1:31:48] record them for us as a Spirit guides
[1:31:50] him a lack of evidence is not the same
[1:31:53] as evidence of a lack
[1:31:57] it's not important that our names be
[1:32:00] recorded for posterity here on Earth
[1:32:03] what is important is that our names are
[1:32:06] found and remain and the Lamb's Book of
[1:32:10] Life
[1:32:12] I'd like to close
[1:32:14] with the song that I closed with last
[1:32:16] time it's the life behind the name it
[1:32:20] was appropriate for Peter in Acts 3. I
[1:32:23] think it fits Stephen's testimony as
[1:32:25] well and now that I know that you're
[1:32:27] familiar with the song I'd like you to
[1:32:30] do everyone a favor and drown me out
[1:32:35] it's the life behind the name that makes
[1:32:40] the demons tremble it's the life behind
[1:32:45] the name
[1:32:47] that makes the proud part of
[1:32:50] [Music]
[1:32:59] he would live live so he could give give
[1:33:04] us the life behind the name once again
[1:33:07] it's the life behind the name
[1:33:11] that makes the demons trouble
[1:33:16] life behind the name
[1:33:20] that makes the cloud work humble it was
[1:33:25] God who divides the plan
[1:33:28] that in all things as a man
[1:33:32] he would live live so he could give us
[1:33:37] the light behind the name
[1:33:48] again
[1:33:51] [Music]
[1:34:05] please
[1:34:08] [Applause]
[1:34:12] let's all stand as we sing it's like

[1:35:25] that brother Lyle and I have both been
[1:35:27] preaching on this book of Acts
[1:35:30] it's that these were normal everyday
[1:35:34] people

[1:35:37] out in the very first first there that
[1:35:40] they even had disputing among themselves
[1:35:42] and his brother Lyle said these are Holy
[1:35:45] Spirit-filled people in perfect unity
[1:35:48] and they were
[1:35:50] but they still had little little things
[1:35:53] because we're human
[1:35:55] and it's it's okay
[1:35:57] praise God you know we we worry so much
[1:36:00] about things about this person said this
[1:36:02] and all the preacher said that and I
[1:36:04] didn't like the way to do that who cares
[1:36:07] is not a big deal the Lord's going to
[1:36:10] take care of it just like he did right
