him standing there a wooden cross in some rusty nails [Music] angels come to rescue god's only son would heal himself and just walk away this is not a price he should even have to pay [Music] [Music]

and though she spoke no words everything she said was her as she poured out all for her master from her box of alabaster [Music] and i've come to pour my praise on him like all [Music] from mary's alabastros oh don't be angry if i wash his feet with my tears oh you weren't there that night when you found me or you did not feel what i felt when you wrapped his loving norms all around me oh you don't know the cost of the oil in my alabaster box [Music] now i can't forget the way life used to be for i was a prisoner to the sin that held me back [Music] i spent my days pouring my life without measure into a little treasure box i thought i'd found until the day when jesus came to me he held my soul with the wonder of his touch oh and now i'm giving back to him all the praise [Music] so much

saints now you know we've been taught there were poets now that god has his men who can you know and it seems for those of us who don't have that ability they just reach out into the ether and they grab those inspirations that father sends by and tonight we'd like to acknowledge a couple of those men first we like to acknowledge brother terry tidwell these are going to be some of his songs not his songs but the songs that the lord let just run through those connections in his fingers so brother terry if you're watching on the stream god bless you tonight thrill in the same way that we're thrilled by what those songs spoke to the children of god you hear about the wars see famine in the land there's questions in the little children's eyes trouble in the east again the whole world is
