[30:11] one phrase I'll let brother Aaron bring
[30:14] the rest of the praises and prayer
[30:15] requests but as Lydia was driving down
[30:18] the freeway today there's a like a piece
[30:21] of guardrail or something of thought of
[30:22] a big truck in front of her and could
[30:25] have easily hit the vehicle and she had
[30:27] the two boys and there could have been
[30:29] really bad but the Lord just kept her
[30:31] it's so thankful for that that he keeps
[30:35] us and the big things and little things
[30:37] that song something keeps holding me
[30:43] [Music]
[30:45] let's start with the the verse that you
[30:47] can put that up
[30:52] good
[30:55] the trials of this world were getting
[31:02] closer
[31:06] the pole I felt was more than I could
[31:11] bear
[31:14] and I was on
[31:18] verge of giving over
[31:23] the strength within myself just wasn't
[31:29] bad
[31:31] something keeps holding me
[31:36] every day I see is helping me faithfully
[31:43] to overcome my try
[31:48] he's guiding me constantly giving me
[31:54] victory
[31:57] he's a reality something keeps old
[32:02] [Music]
[32:06] or satan laid before me his temptation
[32:14] it was his desire to steal away my fame
[32:22] but I have found inside the revelation
[32:28] amen
[32:30] the strength I need to keep me in his
[32:35] grave
[32:37] for Jesus keeps holding me
[32:42] every day I see
[32:46] he's helping me faithfully overcome my
[32:51] try
[32:53] it's guiding me constantly
[32:58] giving me
[33:02] he's a reality Jesus keeps holding me
[33:08] one more time Jesus keeps holding me
[33:15] every day
[33:16] I see he's helping me faithfully
[33:22] overcome my child
[33:28] that's all stand
[33:33] [Music]
[33:44] do you know that which is holding you
[33:46] and are you holding on to him he's the
[33:51] sure and mighty foundation the fighting
[33:54] fortresses or thoughts into my heart
[33:58] into my heart
[34:02] [Music]
[34:08] into my
[34:10] [Music]
[34:16] forty
[34:23] [Music]
[34:52] [Applause]
[34:57] [Music]
[35:18] you may be seated go ahead and continue
[35:21] to play we do have a couple of requests
[35:25] and a couple of announcements to me
[35:28] sister
[35:29] Amelia's asking us to remember in prayer
[35:34] somebody's been vandalizing her mailbox
[35:37] sticking pieces of twigs and stuff in
[35:40] where she cannot open the mailbox and
[35:43] they've done it off and on now in the
[35:46] management hasn't done to help her when
[35:50] she's gone so you know God has a way of
[35:55] taking care of things sometimes we'd say
[35:58] well I would do this and I would do that
[36:00] give it into the hand of the Lord and
[36:04] you know I've seen some people plan some
[36:07] elaborate ways to get even with somebody
[36:09] and they go through this whole thing but
[36:14] God can instantly change somebody's
[36:16] heart can't cause something to change so
[36:20] we'll put it in his hands
[36:22] brother Lyle sent me a text yesterday
[36:25] evening I had sent a text to them see
[36:28] how they were doing knowing that they
[36:29] were traveling home they had to gone up
[36:32] to visit the family up in Washington
[36:35] and they had just arrived in a Reno
[36:38] where one of their sons their yesterday
[36:41] evening but they're hoping possibly be
[36:43] home by tomorrow or Friday just a
[36:47] significant have traveling mercies on
[36:50] the way up there they did have a little
[36:52] bit of vehicle problems but they felt
[36:53] that had been taken care of so and
[36:57] there's brother Darrell Ward was to be
[37:03] with us next Sunday but that has been
[37:06] cancelled her brother Darryl's request
[37:09] because some of the young people from
[37:12] for the Donnie Reagan's church there in
[37:14] Happy Valley have tested positive to
[37:17] they covet there was a youth gathering
[37:20] here up in Phoenix and both of the
[37:25] churches that were involved there were
[37:26] some folks now that have tested positive
[37:29] so brother Darrell was going to be
[37:31] tested but had gotten the results in
[37:33] felt would be better if he did not come
[37:35] at this time and possibly the following
[37:40] week or maybe two weeks down the road
[37:42] before it came just to be safe I know
[37:47] one of the other churches in town today
[37:49] also had been exposed and they don't
[37:53] know anything so they're just being
[37:54] cautious and it's not something we have
[37:58] to live in fear about the Bible says if
[38:02] they take up anything deadly or drink
[38:05] anything or they would not be harmed but
[38:09] does that mean that I'm gonna go get a
[38:10] bottle of poison to walk through a snake
[38:12] pit no but if I need to God can take
[38:14] care of me and as I was thinking about
[38:17] that I remember he said get in be a
[38:20] place that blood on the lamppost and
[38:22] stay behind that
[38:25] and yet those that stayed behind it the
[38:29] Death Angel pass and brother Ram says
[38:32] take that same token and apply it in
[38:34] your life apply it in your home apply it
[38:37] in the vehicle you drive apply it in
[38:39] everything you do and he'll take care of
[38:42] you somebody said well you know we want
[38:44] we don't want to be exposed I said you
[38:46] know every day that you're out there
[38:47] you're exposed to something but greater
[38:50] is He that is in us than he that is in
[38:52] the world so just remember those needs
[38:55] and this Sunday brother Matt will be
[39:01] ministering through the livestream since
[39:05] they had to make these changes and we'll
[39:07] just be having one service for brother
[39:09] Matt that would be Sunday morning and
[39:11] he'll be doing that and then we'll have
[39:14] to see whether it'll be brother Darrell
[39:16] the following weekend or so but you pray
[39:18] that God has his way and that we're
[39:20] willing to accept it and do that and I
[39:24] heard and brother Matt also shared some
[39:27] of the testimonies and some of the
[39:29] blessing from Sunday especially the
[39:31] Sunday evening worship after the service
[39:33] it was just such a sweet presence at all
[39:36] and thank the Lord that he's so mindful
[39:38] of us and so good to us so let's just
[39:41] bow our head to remember this need for
[39:43] sister Maria and brother vile and if you
[39:45] have a need or know someone's I know my
[39:48] I mentioned a prayer request for my
[39:50] brother
[39:51] his wife and her and then being hit with
[39:55] that kovat and four members of the
[39:56] family and and that you know there's a
[39:59] fear and a thing but God can grant us
[40:02] peace any so let's just bow our heads
[40:04] for one Lord we we just know that the
[40:07] token has been applied in our lives and
[40:10] hardened it's that Holy Spirit living in
[40:13] us Father we ask you Lord in this
[40:16] situation for sister Mary uh Norden
[40:18] there's somebody vandalizing the mailbox
[40:22] but Lord you're able to take care of
[40:24] that situation protected Lord as you
[40:27] know best how to do brother Lila sister
[40:30] Heather heading on the last part of the
[40:32] journey to come back to home Lord would
[40:34] you be with them keep them safe and
[40:36] every hand raised in every heart here
[40:39] before you and those maybe at home or
[40:41] listening in whatever that need is in
[40:44] their life that situation I know brother
[40:47] Joe Miller with with the passing away
[40:50] one of the co-workers and how it's
[40:53] affected those when we know someone
[40:54] that's a friend or a dear one to us
[40:57] Gordon it shows that in the human life
[41:00] how temporary it is but we're looking to
[41:03] you Lord the author and the giver of
[41:05] eternal life or would you come in
[41:08] comfort and strengthen and encourage
[41:10] each one today we ask him Jesus Christ
[41:14] amen thank you this evening a night was
[41:25] a couple of things that I was looking at
[41:29] sometimes you felt pulled one way and
[41:32] then a different direction and I I was
[41:38] listening to to or reading a message on
[41:40] the one god rich in mercy and I'm glad
[41:44] he's rich in mercy I'm glad that I can't
[41:48] exhaust his mercy oh I can probably get
[41:51] him upset at me as maybe we would are
[41:54] what if our parents or something but we
[41:57] don't exhaust his mercy mercy he said he
[41:59] is rich in mercy and I reading through
[42:03] that and some other things and just felt
[42:06] that God led me in this direction but I
[42:07] sometimes you still question it
[42:09] am I going in the right direction is
[42:11] this and and I was just going over this
[42:14] and I said well you know it's this I
[42:18] said lord I don't want to direct this at
[42:20] anybody or anything I don't want it to
[42:22] come that way and then as the Lord I
[42:24] felt told me so why don't you direct it
[42:26] at yourself so this is for me okay it's
[42:30] not for you it's for me and and it just
[42:34] will take the first scripture and you'll
[42:36] see maybe in what direction will go with
[42:38] and Deuteronomy chapter 25 will read
[42:42] verses 13 through 15 and it was
[42:45] something I spoke about ten years ago
[42:48] and it was brought to my memory so I
[42:50] just rehearsed it a little bit but you
[42:54] know just was looking at this and and
[42:55] and feeling about this and I said I see
[43:00] what God would have do with us and today
[43:02] this evening Lord gave me something that
[43:03] I thought was just comfort in my heart
[43:06] or settled it in my heart
[43:07] thou shalt not have in thy bag divers
[43:10] weights are great and a small
[43:14] and so yeah it might be a little
[43:16] puzzling a little strange tax but this
[43:21] was in the law giving the law you're not
[43:24] going to have a heavyweight in a light
[43:27] weight and he says thou shalt not have
[43:29] in thine house
[43:31] divers measures a greatness small but
[43:35] thou shalt have a perfect and just wait
[43:38] a perfect and just measure shalt thou
[43:41] have that thy days may be lengthened in
[43:45] the land which the LORD thy God giveth
[43:47] thee and as I looked at that it made me
[43:51] think how many times did God say if you
[43:53] keep this my days will be lengthen wow
[43:57] he says that quite often speaking it in
[44:01] the natural - to Israel but in the
[44:04] spiritual to us not necessarily in this
[44:08] land but in the promises of God to
[44:10] eternal life but a perfect and just
[44:13] weight so if I would title this I would
[44:16] say judging by law or judging by grace
[44:20] you know and and sometimes it's easy and
[44:23] I was sharing this with my wife and the
[44:25] girls and I might have startled them a
[44:28] little bit yesterday maybe not it's kind
[44:30] of hard to startle them I think they're
[44:32] pretty used to their dad but we're just
[44:35] talking about some of the events that
[44:36] are going on and and all the things that
[44:39] are happening and every time you open
[44:40] the news or hear something some
[44:42] different and I said you know sometimes
[44:43] it just makes me angry I said and I've
[44:46] had this thought I said get a gun and
[44:48] shoot them all and then I have to repent
[44:52] why would I have that idea but the anger
[44:55] and the frustration so it just kind of
[44:58] boiled over a little bit and I said Lord
[45:00] you know I'm glad you don't look at us
[45:02] that way and say I should just shoot him
[45:06] but God rich in mercy God would look
[45:10] down and say I'm not happy with that but
[45:12] you're still my son
[45:13] you're still my job and as I was looking
[45:17] at this in divers weights and measures
[45:20] and all and I thought this may be how I
[45:24] would treat a brother or sister
[45:26] the church and how I would treat my
[45:28] neighbor and how I would treat somebody
[45:30] I don't even know well he's my brother
[45:34] and his sister so I'm gonna give him the
[45:35] best deal he's my neighbor so he's gonna
[45:38] hit a good deal but not as good as my
[45:40] brother and sister and the person I
[45:42] don't know I'm gonna get the best deal
[45:44] out of him but the Bible tells us know
[45:48] that we should be just imperfect in our
[45:51] actions and our enter in our dealings
[45:54] and that in the daily things that we do
[45:56] how we approach things you know and as I
[46:01] was looking through this and I started
[46:03] looking at the word judging and and see
[46:06] the attitude and how God spoke through
[46:08] through both the Old Testament and the
[46:10] New Testament and this evening I found
[46:13] this quote and I've asked brother Jordan
[46:14] them to actually play and sometimes you
[46:18] read it and then you hear brother Graham
[46:20] saying it just has a different effect so
[46:22] if he would play that that it's just a
[46:24] couple minutes long Elijah represented
[47:04] the Justice of God in representation of
[47:11] God's justice issues and our divisions
[47:15] whatever they're clean 15 and raise them
[47:24] God met father fall from heaven he
[47:26] continues down come to bar justice of
[47:30] God bench Christian was on the presence
[47:33] of the King said that to fire benefit of
[47:37] their path truth - it
[47:39] [Music]
[47:39] Oh
[47:48] [Music]
[47:55] [Music]
[48:03] [Music]
[48:10] [Music]
[48:36] [Music]
[48:46] [Music]
[49:40] [Music]
[49:43] I think that says it all does the law
[51:33] today I was coming down the way down
[51:36] here and the law said 65 miles an hour
[51:39] once we got past the down around were
[51:42] taro and I looked up and I said I think
[51:45] that's brother Jordan and sister Martha
[51:48] on the vehicle and I passed them up and
[51:51] they were doing about 65 and I was doing
[51:53] closer to 70 and brother Jordan said hi
[51:57] or waved to me as I went by him and then
[51:59] we got down into the construction zone
[52:01] and it's 55 so I slowed down to 60 so I
[52:05] was kind of obeying the law brother
[52:09] Jordan and them stayed back me so I
[52:10] think they were obeying the law I'm just
[52:13] saying are we gonna be sticklers for the
[52:16] law is everything somebody driving 55 in
[52:21] a 55 mile at speed zone but you want to
[52:23] go 65 million you get angry at them hey
[52:27] I said I'm talking about me it's just
[52:32] and I found this quote this evening or
[52:34] this afternoon and I said do we really
[52:37] want God's justice just a demanded the
[52:41] life of somebody so rather than take it
[52:46] out on you he took it out on his son and
[52:50] he's the only one that can redeem us in
[52:53] second chronicles chapter 19 6 and 7 and
[53:00] he said to the judges take heed what you
[53:02] do for you judge not for man but for the
[53:06] Lord who is with you in the judgment
[53:11] when you realize when you and sometimes
[53:14] we have to make a judgment you have to
[53:16] make a decision in a situation something
[53:19] that's come at man you have to say
[53:20] brother green used to say this he used
[53:22] to say don't talk about him like that
[53:24] he's my boss has anybody ever said that
[53:29] when somebody sings him using God's name
[53:31] and man you said hey that's my god I
[53:34] have never stopped somebody honestly and
[53:37] told him to quit saying that and tell
[53:38] him that but that's really what we
[53:41] should say you're speaking evil of my
[53:44] boss you're speaking evil of the one
[53:47] that loves me that saves me well but
[53:50] that's a little embarrassing he was not
[53:53] embarrassed to be stripped naked and
[53:55] hang on a cross for me and you and
[53:59] that's grace
[54:01] so he says look you're not for me you're
[54:05] not judging for men's club you're
[54:07] judging and the Lord is with you if
[54:11] you're a conscious that he's with you
[54:14] you would really be careful with up your
[54:15] attitude and that's why I asked sir
[54:18] sister Martha to play into my heart come
[54:20] into my heart Lord where for the next
[54:27] verse there brother
[54:28] Jordan we verse 7 second chronicles
[54:33] wherefore now let the fear of the Lord
[54:35] be upon you take heed and do it for
[54:40] there is no iniquity with the Lord our
[54:42] God nor respect for persons nor taking
[54:46] of gifts well I know that if I do this
[54:49] I'm gonna get something nice back and if
[54:52] I do this one because that one has you
[54:55] know higher prestige it's not my dad
[54:57] I'll be nice to that one we're to love
[55:01] and treat one another especially those
[55:04] of the household faith as we would treat
[55:07] Christ as he would treat us and we
[55:10] should have that attitude let's go to
[55:13] Matthew chapter 7 and this is Jesus
[55:17] speaking one through five their judge
[55:20] not that you be not judged we are we
[55:24] must judge you you are to take are you
[55:27] you should have an attitude as as you
[55:29] look at something do I want to partake
[55:31] of that is it profitable for me is it a
[55:34] good thing that's not what he's saying
[55:37] but when we turn around we judge someone
[55:39] else for their actions he says because
[55:43] the way you judge you're going to be
[55:45] judged back for with what judgment ye
[55:48] judge ye shall be judged and with what
[55:51] measure you mete it shall be measured to
[55:53] you again therefore if your judgment is
[55:55] with a perfect weight and a perfect
[55:57] measure you get judged back the same way
[55:59] with the same mercy and the same grace
[56:02] of God and why behold us now it says the
[56:07] mote that is in thy brother's eye the
[56:09] little splinter
[56:10] little thing that's in his eye but
[56:11] considerest not the beam that is in
[56:13] thine own eye now when I think of a beam
[56:16] I don't think of a little piece of wood
[56:18] I think of something that's holding up
[56:20] the building I got one of those in my
[56:23] eye but I'm complaining or talking to
[56:25] you about the little spot in yours
[56:27] he always says thou hypocrite first cast
[56:31] out the beam out of thine own eye and
[56:33] then thou shalt see clearly to cast out
[56:36] the mote of thy brother's eye suddenly
[56:40] your attitude changes suddenly your
[56:42] perspective changes and as I was looking
[56:45] this God brought some things back to my
[56:47] remembrance and again this is about me
[56:49] okay I'm not aiming this at anybody else
[56:51] don't take it personally to you and I'll
[56:56] just just say like it was we had two
[56:58] brothers who were part of this church
[57:00] and they both both wanted to be the
[57:03] pastor of this church both um said the
[57:06] Lord said they would be the pastor of
[57:07] church and it didn't go that way
[57:09] and they both left and started their own
[57:12] churches and they're my brothers they're
[57:17] part of the family of God they're my
[57:19] brothers okay but I'd got to the point
[57:22] that I was upset with him and and I'd
[57:26] gotten under might just be honest with
[57:27] you okay I got to the point that I
[57:30] started asking the Lord to do something
[57:32] to catch our attention and straighten
[57:33] them out and and I was saying Lord but
[57:37] you know they need to be straightened
[57:38] out they need to be taken care of
[57:39] they're wrong in this and they're wrong
[57:41] with that Lord whatever you need to do
[57:42] do it to them and I found myself
[57:45] thinking that one day and I said Lord
[57:47] how did I get to this stage that I would
[57:50] be wishing ill on my brother so I went
[57:55] to the Lord I got on my knees and went
[57:56] to the Lord I said can you do something
[57:58] about this and he did he straightened
[58:01] those brothers out honest no he didn't
[58:04] he worked on this guy and right after
[58:08] that in the same place I ran into both
[58:11] of those brothers
[58:13] okay and as I came up to him here's my
[58:16] thought here's my feeling I said wow
[58:19] this brother has changed
[58:21] there's a whole different atmosphere an
[58:23] attitude about it I greeted him and
[58:26] talked to him he had a good conversation
[58:27] I walked into the building and the other
[58:30] brother is sitting there and the only
[58:31] open chair was the one next to him so I
[58:33] went down to sat next to him and I said
[58:36] Lord you changed this brother too
[58:40] and then it dawned on me no he had
[58:43] worked on me he had come into my heart
[58:47] said no the problem is right here and
[58:52] they are my brothers and I could see
[58:54] them that way and I thank God and I
[58:56] confessed it God changed my heart I was
[59:01] no longer their judge I wanted the same
[59:04] mercy and same compassion that God has
[59:06] had on me on them you know again I
[59:10] needed the beam taken out of my eye and
[59:13] I didn't find him out in their eye after
[59:15] that because it had been change in my
[59:19] heart Luke chapter 6 35 to 38 we got
[59:31] that scripture up there Luke 36 35 but
[59:35] love your enemies and do good and lend
[59:37] hoping for nothing again and your reward
[59:42] shall be great and ye shall be the
[59:45] children of the highest for he is kind
[59:49] unto the unthankful and to the evil
[59:52] and I'm glad he is because that includes
[59:55] me because sometimes I'm not thankful
[59:58] and sometimes I do things that are wrong
[1:00:00] but he's kind B therefore merciful as
[1:00:06] your father also is merciful judge not
[1:00:09] and ye shall be not be judged condemn
[1:00:11] not and ye shall not be condemned
[1:00:14] forgive and you shall be forgiven I feel
[1:00:18] I feel like like I'm not being forgiven
[1:00:20] well take a look are you forgiving you
[1:00:25] know this just well
[1:00:26] to whom you you extend mercy and want
[1:00:29] mercy you must be merciful and they go
[1:00:32] hand in hand and then in John's 724
[1:00:39] these were just subscriptions judge not
[1:00:42] according to the appearance but Judge
[1:00:44] righteous just let not your decisions be
[1:00:48] judged by what you see you don't have
[1:00:51] all the information you don't have all
[1:00:53] the news you didn't see it in the same
[1:00:54] perspective you know when somebody is a
[1:00:58] witness of something they needed to be
[1:01:00] one who saw what happened
[1:01:02] to be a true witness well I
[1:01:06] brother Myrtle told me about it so I'm
[1:01:08] gonna go stand in the witness but I
[1:01:09] wasn't the witness brother Marilla was
[1:01:11] the witness because he actually saw it
[1:01:13] happen and sometimes we want to be we
[1:01:18] want to judge because not by the
[1:01:21] appearance of the thing but judging
[1:01:25] righteous judgment with a right spirit
[1:01:28] you know and and sometimes we do we
[1:01:30] judge by an appearance there was
[1:01:33] something did happen and there was a
[1:01:35] young lady here at the church it's been
[1:01:37] quite a few years ago and she had had a
[1:01:41] heart up raising her her father was one
[1:01:44] of those that believed brother Branham
[1:01:45] was God and and she had really really
[1:01:48] had a hard up race and she had been
[1:01:49] abused and all and and she was here that
[1:01:52] church and and and I've never been in a
[1:01:56] situation like that I was not raised
[1:01:58] that way I couldn't say I know how you
[1:02:00] feel because I don't because I had good
[1:02:03] Christian parents I had a good home
[1:02:05] raised in and I'm grateful for that I
[1:02:07] thank the Lord but not everybody had
[1:02:09] that so she penned a letter one time and
[1:02:14] I read it and I asked her if I could
[1:02:18] read it back and she pinned the letter I
[1:02:21] don't know what I lost it right and and
[1:02:23] it was probably two pages long but she
[1:02:26] talked about herself coming and how
[1:02:28] people had received her and then she
[1:02:30] fell away and how people turn their back
[1:02:32] on her and the end of the letter was
[1:02:36] somebody smiled at me and gave me hope
[1:02:39] and somebody said they care and others
[1:02:43] turned their back in n and she said
[1:02:46] which one were you and it really caught
[1:02:48] my thought my attention I I got
[1:02:51] permission from her to read it and I
[1:02:53] read it to the congregation and after
[1:02:56] service I had somebody pull me aside and
[1:02:58] they really read me the riot act for
[1:03:01] reading that letter because they
[1:03:03] condemned that sister and they gave me
[1:03:06] all their reasons for it he should have
[1:03:09] never read it that was wrong she's such
[1:03:11] a bad girl and they did all of this and
[1:03:12] I'm like you didn't catch the spirit of
[1:03:16] what we were trying to say it's a sad
[1:03:21] thing to say now that that person did
[1:03:23] that that is now in the same situation
[1:03:24] as other person is so away from God
[1:03:28] remember how you judge your couldn't be
[1:03:30] too much back if you're judging someone
[1:03:33] as if you are perfect then you better be
[1:03:36] perfect
[1:03:37] you better have no faults because that's
[1:03:40] how you'll be judged but if you're
[1:03:42] judging somebody with the same mercy
[1:03:44] that God judge you had the merciful
[1:03:47] she'll find mercy
[1:03:50] James and I just want to go to this here
[1:03:53] and we're not gonna be very long tonight
[1:03:55] James 5 19 and 20 and watch what James
[1:03:58] says brethren if any of you do err from
[1:04:02] the truth and one convert and somebody
[1:04:07] in their heart says I'm gonna go after
[1:04:09] my brother after my sister I'm gonna go
[1:04:12] see what I can do to to to restore them
[1:04:16] back to the fold you know to to do
[1:04:20] something cuz let him know that he which
[1:04:22] would converteth the sinner from the
[1:04:24] error of his way shall save a soul from
[1:04:28] death and shall hide a multitude of sins
[1:04:32] I'm glad somebody had mercy on me I'm
[1:04:36] glad somebody looked past this guy and
[1:04:38] said there's one worth redeeming if he
[1:04:43] had looked at the outer and their
[1:04:44] parents here but I said no chance no
[1:04:45] hope no nothing but he said I will go
[1:04:48] for that one remember they would have
[1:04:52] the Pharisee in the sad you see and the
[1:04:54] the lawgiver and the priest and they saw
[1:04:56] that injured man and they gave him a
[1:04:58] wide berth went around a long ways from
[1:05:01] him but the publican came by and he saw
[1:05:06] man hurting and he stopped and he comes
[1:05:10] by where the Good Samaritan I'm sorry
[1:05:11] and he comes by knee and he comes in and
[1:05:13] he any ministers to the needs of the of
[1:05:16] this one that was was hurting and
[1:05:18] bleeding and and had been beaten upon
[1:05:20] and and and you know attacked and all
[1:05:22] and he takes them to the end and he says
[1:05:24] look take care of this man give him that
[1:05:27] which he has need feed him bathe him and
[1:05:30] cover his wounds and then when I come
[1:05:31] back on my next trip if it costs you
[1:05:33] more than I have here I'll pay you again
[1:05:37] watch what happens is a kiss when God
[1:05:39] said Zacchaeus come down any when Jesus
[1:05:43] goes into any and he's there with him in
[1:05:45] his home what does the Kia say if I have
[1:05:47] wronged any man I will pay back
[1:05:49] fold what I have wronged a man that's
[1:05:52] the Spirit of Christ rather than a harsh
[1:05:56] Mosaic law judgment
[1:06:01] sometimes I find myself Lord do this
[1:06:05] Lord do that I did especially with all
[1:06:08] that's happening right now
[1:06:09] democratic-republicans sometimes it
[1:06:11] makes you angry how could people be that
[1:06:13] way boy they need a good lesson I have
[1:06:16] to say God like you have mercy have
[1:06:18] mercy on them also it made me think of
[1:06:22] the prodigal son there's there's two
[1:06:25] boys in that story that Jesus shares one
[1:06:29] who never left the house the Bible
[1:06:32] doesn't say he ever did anything wrong
[1:06:34] he never left the house the other one
[1:06:37] that took his is the inheritance that
[1:06:39] his father gave him and he went out to
[1:06:41] enjoy himself I don't think he had any
[1:06:44] intention to be in a pig pen at the end
[1:06:46] of his day I don't think anybody's ever
[1:06:50] got up in the morning and said boy I
[1:06:52] just want to have the most miserable day
[1:06:54] I ever had today I've ever had before I
[1:06:56] surely don't pray that way you know but
[1:07:00] sometimes we get into situation
[1:07:02] something happens something goes wrong
[1:07:04] first job on on yesterday morning
[1:07:07] Tuesday I step out of the truck there's
[1:07:09] a drain there in the middle of Street
[1:07:10] Mikey falls out and falls right into the
[1:07:12] drink fortunately it wasn't a real deep
[1:07:15] one it was only about a foot and a half
[1:07:17] so nobody drove by while I was on my
[1:07:20] hands and knees with a stick trying to
[1:07:22] get my keys out of there you know but I
[1:07:24] didn't ask the Lord let me have one of
[1:07:25] those days but he did and that's okay
[1:07:29] but this young man when he took his
[1:07:31] father's inheritance when he got those
[1:07:33] things that it was his inheritance and
[1:07:36] he went out I'm gonna go have a good
[1:07:38] time I'm gonna go do this I want to go
[1:07:41] see the world I want to go enjoy this
[1:07:43] but when no intention to be where I
[1:07:46] ended up but that's where he ended up
[1:07:49] one time it doesn't say how long it was
[1:07:52] maybe a year maybe six months maybe five
[1:07:55] years we don't know God Jesus has given
[1:07:57] this story and then this this young man
[1:08:00] ends up in a pig pen in the swamp in the
[1:08:03] mess but the other brother stayed home
[1:08:06] the whole time
[1:08:07] never left had access to everything
[1:08:10] because his father told him that
[1:08:12] he says this is all yours it's always
[1:08:15] been yours brother branham says that
[1:08:18] table is spread and the food is on there
[1:08:21] and he says eat and then his last
[1:08:24] statement was if you don't want any then
[1:08:27] starve that sounds kind of mean but it's
[1:08:31] true so this young man it finally comes
[1:08:35] to let's just say it's a year down the
[1:08:37] road he comes to he realizes you know
[1:08:39] the servants might my father servants
[1:08:42] are better off than I am right now and
[1:08:46] it made me think I said what was his
[1:08:49] attitude as he's coming back we know
[1:08:51] he's gonna tell his father he's making
[1:08:53] this decision he's talking to himself
[1:08:54] and saying I'm gonna go to my father and
[1:08:57] I'm gonna tell him I am not worthy to be
[1:08:59] your son anymore
[1:09:00] I haven't tried that on my mom and my
[1:09:03] dad cuz I don't want to ever say yeah
[1:09:05] you're right I don't think they ever
[1:09:08] would but imagine that your son or your
[1:09:13] daughter would come back up to you and
[1:09:15] tell you I messed up therefore I'm not
[1:09:17] your daughter I am NOT your son anymore
[1:09:20] a true mother to a father would not say
[1:09:24] all you never did nothing they'll say we
[1:09:26] need to address that but you're still my
[1:09:27] son you're still my daughter so this is
[1:09:32] this young man is coming back up towards
[1:09:34] the house however long that journey was
[1:09:36] maybe a month maybe a longer I don't
[1:09:38] know but he's thinking I'm going to go
[1:09:40] to my father and I'm gonna tell him I am
[1:09:42] not worthy to be your son I've done all
[1:09:45] this wrong I failed you I've made your
[1:09:47] name look bad everybody knew who I was
[1:09:49] that you were this great man and and and
[1:09:52] I ruined your reputation and you know is
[1:09:55] that the son of so-and-so my look at
[1:09:57] that so he's thinking I'm not I'm gonna
[1:10:01] come back and humble myself and say I'm
[1:10:04] just gonna be one year service
[1:10:06] but the father it says was looking out
[1:10:09] from his house down the pathway and
[1:10:12] saying is my son coming home today is he
[1:10:15] returning is he willing to come back and
[1:10:18] say father will you receive me the
[1:10:22] desire of the heart of the father was my
[1:10:24] son to come back to come home and and
[1:10:28] he's coming back up getting close to his
[1:10:30] neighborhood and I'm sure the
[1:10:32] neighborhood knew the story the son had
[1:10:35] taken the inheritance had spent it had
[1:10:37] wasted it
[1:10:38] oh my look at that here he comes and you
[1:10:42] know I don't know what his name was I'm
[1:10:43] gonna call him Bob okay here comes Bob
[1:10:47] he's walking up the road and the
[1:10:49] neighborhood is looking at him and said
[1:10:51] there he is what a mess
[1:10:53] what a disgrace look what he did I can't
[1:10:56] believe how he took advantage of his
[1:10:58] father could you believe there were
[1:11:00] people like us you know and he's gone
[1:11:04] but the father is looking the father
[1:11:06] says a father ran down to meet him he
[1:11:10] willingly left the highest place and he
[1:11:13] came down to meet his children he left
[1:11:17] glory to come back down to this Pigpen
[1:11:20] of earth to save us his willing to give
[1:11:24] it up and the father in him and he tells
[1:11:28] of dad I cannot even be your son him or
[1:11:30] her father says you are my son I'm gonna
[1:11:33] put the robe back on you we're going to
[1:11:35] feast today you are my son but this was
[1:11:40] my other thought with that what men did
[1:11:43] that son think of the servants did he
[1:11:47] come back I said oh boy I'm back on top
[1:11:49] again I'm your Lord you're gonna do what
[1:11:51] I say no I think he had a little
[1:11:53] compassion on the servants now cuz now
[1:11:55] he had been in their shoes he had to
[1:11:58] work for a living had to eat the slop he
[1:12:00] had to eat you know so he comes back and
[1:12:03] he's now looking at the service you say
[1:12:04] hey I'm gonna be nice a lot nicer to you
[1:12:06] than I ever was because I've been in
[1:12:08] your stead now I've been where you're at
[1:12:11] and it wasn't any good it was no fun
[1:12:16] but the other Sun is there and we know
[1:12:18] he never left the house he was there he
[1:12:20] had access to it all he just chose not
[1:12:23] to the father tells him this has all
[1:12:27] been yours all the time but you chose
[1:12:31] not to partake of it you chose not to
[1:12:33] take any of that and how many times have
[1:12:36] we've gone to bed miserable at night
[1:12:38] because we just number ourselves down
[1:12:40] and say father I'm sorry and he said
[1:12:43] we'll come back on then wake up in the
[1:12:46] morning maybe angry or grumpy or
[1:12:47] something like that didn't have a good
[1:12:48] night to sleep or some when simply you
[1:12:50] could have gone on your knees and say
[1:12:51] Lord I'm sorry maybe to your spouse
[1:12:54] maybe to your brother to your sister
[1:12:56] whoever and just say I didn't mean that
[1:12:58] would you forgive me and then peace is
[1:13:00] made and when peace is made the spirits
[1:13:02] that are tormenting you leave God is the
[1:13:06] author of peace if you have a tormenting
[1:13:10] spirit that's not the Spirit of God just
[1:13:13] make it right
[1:13:14] come back and said i judge wrong III
[1:13:18] went this way and I went this way and I
[1:13:20] was wrong and it's okay the peace that
[1:13:23] comes with it is worth it every bit of
[1:13:25] it and I think I just was thinking about
[1:13:28] that prodigal son I said boy he had a
[1:13:30] different attitude about his his sermons
[1:13:34] he probably didn't look at him as
[1:13:35] servants anymore he probably went out
[1:13:38] and he would talk to them just like he
[1:13:39] would they were one of his they were
[1:13:41] their brother and sister I've been where
[1:13:43] you're at and now God has restored me
[1:13:49] I'd like to read a couple of quotes here
[1:13:52] let's start with that first one enticing
[1:13:54] spirits said now let's lay aside every
[1:14:03] weight you got a temper
[1:14:05] you got something about you makes you
[1:14:07] talk when you want not to talk oh God
[1:14:09] lay it there now lay it there watch the
[1:14:12] fire of the altar come down and take it
[1:14:13] away watch the love of God lick it up
[1:14:16] watch all the that old selfishness that
[1:14:19] way you've been talking to your wife the
[1:14:21] way you've been talking to your husband
[1:14:23] the way you've been talking to your
[1:14:24] neighbor the way you've been talking to
[1:14:26] the people in the church lay it on the
[1:14:27] altar this morning and the fire of God
[1:14:30] will come down and take it right away
[1:14:33] and divine love will burn in its place
[1:14:39] amen
[1:14:40] God can do he did that in my heart he
[1:14:44] changed that for me because I but I just
[1:14:46] had to get behind him say I'm sorry and
[1:14:48] he'll do Jubilee year if you have enmity
[1:14:52] against you against some neighbor
[1:14:54] against somebody else that's done you
[1:14:56] harm and that person has done you harm
[1:14:58] if you and your heart can't love that
[1:15:01] person
[1:15:01] don't take that experience you must love
[1:15:05] those who do not love you if you love
[1:15:07] those that who love you sinners do the
[1:15:09] same but you've got now not just to act
[1:15:13] like it's a religious act but from your
[1:15:16] heart you have to
[1:15:18] us time to go to church I'm gonna put my
[1:15:22] church clothes on my church phazon and
[1:15:24] my church attitude on because I'm in
[1:15:27] church it's time to do a religious act
[1:15:29] but if your heart is not in it it's just
[1:15:33] a religious act but here he says but
[1:15:36] from your heart let it become that which
[1:15:39] comes from your heart then you don't
[1:15:42] have to put an act on it'll be it'll be
[1:15:45] natural let's go on to divine love and
[1:15:50] Sovereign Grace now listen I want to
[1:15:54] tell you something human beings are more
[1:15:56] intelligent than animals and you can't
[1:15:59] tell people you love them they won't
[1:16:02] believe it unless the real things there
[1:16:04] to prove it so you say oh brother you
[1:16:06] know how we have such great fellowship
[1:16:09] and down into your heart a grudge he
[1:16:12] knows different God knows it your
[1:16:14] neighbour knows that you got to be clean
[1:16:16] and aboveboard and say Lord God created
[1:16:19] me a clean heart to love you know they
[1:16:24] say animals can detect your spirit
[1:16:26] really see your attitude those of you
[1:16:28] who've had pets you can see how they are
[1:16:29] you know sometimes you turn around and
[1:16:32] when Nina and Steven were here they
[1:16:34] brought the dogs with them because last
[1:16:36] time they had left them and the
[1:16:39] caretakers had a hard time with him
[1:16:41] because they were unhappy because Nina
[1:16:42] and Steven were gone so they brought him
[1:16:44] and you know we hadn't had dogs in the
[1:16:48] house for a couple of years or in the
[1:16:49] yard and dad hadn't didn't have to clean
[1:16:51] up so I was kind of happy about that you
[1:16:53] know I didn't have to clean up after him
[1:16:55] and all and but I said bring him that's
[1:16:57] okay they'll have the yard to run around
[1:16:59] in and so they got into what about three
[1:17:03] or four in the morning I think they're
[1:17:04] driven all night and I got up to go to
[1:17:06] work and I step outside and here comes
[1:17:09] their dog Andrey and he attacks me he
[1:17:12] literally came flying at me with his
[1:17:13] mouth opening growling and fortunately
[1:17:15] Steven was there and caught him in the
[1:17:17] midair and I said Henry you're glad
[1:17:20] Stevens here he'd be a dead dog just
[1:17:22] write about
[1:17:23] he scratched me it didn't get me with
[1:17:26] the teeth with his paws right and it
[1:17:28] took me a moment to realize Stephen is
[1:17:32] is the one he watches so and I was a
[1:17:34] threat to Stephen according to what he
[1:17:36] saw he caught right away here I have a
[1:17:40] threat and he came to protect Stephen it
[1:17:43] took a couple of days for Henry to get
[1:17:45] calmed down so he'd be okay when we'd
[1:17:48] come outside they can catch the spirit
[1:17:50] the mode we had to treat him nice we had
[1:17:52] to go on toggle him to go to pet pet him
[1:17:54] and all and after a while he was having
[1:17:55] fun with us how about with your brother
[1:17:58] and your sister when you get angry you
[1:18:02] get upset you get frustrated you get mad
[1:18:04] and and and you you come across with
[1:18:07] that strong spirit lord help us
[1:18:11] sometimes the position of a believer in
[1:18:16] Christ the fruit of the Spirit is love
[1:18:17] what is God love and if you can't love
[1:18:21] your enemy no matter what he says about
[1:18:22] you your neighbor what he says about you
[1:18:24] if from your heart not with your lips
[1:18:28] not with the knowledge that you should
[1:18:30] be doing it as a Christian but something
[1:18:32] in your heart makes you love them
[1:18:34] anyways regardless of what you say then
[1:18:38] it's time to come to the altar again you
[1:18:40] just never quite got what you thought or
[1:18:43] what really you should have I've been
[1:18:47] there confessor to you I've been there
[1:18:50] God can't change those things if we're
[1:18:54] willing to say Lord I need some help
[1:18:55] Lord I need an attitude change Lord I
[1:18:58] want my heart to be different be be
[1:19:01] willing to quickly say I'm sorry maybe
[1:19:04] let me be willing to quickly make it
[1:19:06] right you know we do sometimes we say
[1:19:10] things out of turn we get upset for a
[1:19:13] moment maybe the you know a little bit
[1:19:16] of anger and it and it flashes up real
[1:19:18] quick but brother Graham says this quick
[1:19:20] as you can get a hold yourself make it
[1:19:22] right Satan deed in the last one
[1:19:28] is that the one we just know there is if
[1:19:31] there sin in your heart if there's a
[1:19:33] Fault in your heart you got something
[1:19:34] you got anything pray now and ask God to
[1:19:36] forgive you you pray for me this is at
[1:19:39] the end of the the the tape at the
[1:19:42] service he's speaking to the to the
[1:19:43] congregation you'll pray for me I'll
[1:19:45] pray for you
[1:19:46] amen you pray for me I'll pray for you
[1:19:49] one another we're all part of the body
[1:19:53] of Christ god bless you is my prayer
[1:19:56] till we meet again till we meet god be
[1:19:58] with you till we meet again do you love
[1:20:00] one another
[1:20:01] john said little children love one
[1:20:03] another love one another for love covers
[1:20:06] a multitude of sins now let us shake one
[1:20:09] another's hand god be with you till we
[1:20:12] meet again until we meet now be kind to
[1:20:15] one another be kind to everybody treat
[1:20:18] your neighbor right keep yourself
[1:20:20] unspotted till Jesus comes a bride
[1:20:24] that's without spot without wrinkle
[1:20:26] that's in every phase and portion of our
[1:20:29] life it just
[1:20:33] that's his words he's as he's speaking
[1:20:35] that to this church keep yourself
[1:20:38] unspotted don't give Satan a place to
[1:20:42] get on to hold to grab brother branham
[1:20:46] said at this well you can't keep the
[1:20:47] birds from flying over your your head
[1:20:49] but you can keep them from building the
[1:20:51] nest once they build the nests it's hard
[1:20:54] to get rid of them
[1:20:55] yeah so he's talking about that he said
[1:20:58] love one another treat one another right
[1:21:01] and this is the promise one of the
[1:21:04] promises it comes with it I heard a
[1:21:06] brother speaking just a portion and he
[1:21:09] was talking about this is the day of
[1:21:11] rights everybody is is is out there
[1:21:15] protesting for the rights whether you
[1:21:18] know it's right this way or right that
[1:21:19] way this guy's rights are different than
[1:21:21] their right so then you know I want
[1:21:23] their rights and oh I want these rights
[1:21:24] because everybody's doing that you know
[1:21:26] just about everything is coming up you
[1:21:29] know and
[1:21:30] and and he is saying why not it's
[1:21:33] allowed of Sam this is the day of rights
[1:21:37] this is the manifestation of what Lauda
[1:21:39] see is I don't need God I just want my
[1:21:43] own rights I want to do what I want to
[1:21:45] do I want to do as I please and don't
[1:21:47] tell me otherwise and he said when you
[1:21:52] hold on to your rights all you'll have
[1:21:55] is pain and trouble and unrest and
[1:22:00] failure because you'll never be happy
[1:22:04] but if you'll surrender your rights
[1:22:07] like a sheep surrenders its wool if
[1:22:09] you'll say Lord I'm giving it all to you
[1:22:11] and then watch the difference that's
[1:22:16] what she does what's what the bride does
[1:22:17] she gives herself to him and then he
[1:22:21] says I'll leave the ninety-nine that are
[1:22:23] in the fold to go get that one because
[1:22:28] that's that's who he is that's how the
[1:22:30] care that he has for you so in Isaiah
[1:22:34] 26:3 watch what he says here we've got
[1:22:39] just a few scriptures here Isaiah 26:3
[1:22:43] that will keep him in perfect peace
[1:22:46] whose mind is stayed on thee because he
[1:22:49] trusts us in their perfect peace
[1:22:52] complete peace a whole peace in every
[1:22:55] aspect of your life in every part not
[1:22:58] just when you're a church not just when
[1:23:00] you're inside your home but in any
[1:23:02] situation God can keep you at peace
[1:23:04] about it what is peace the absent of war
[1:23:06] what is Ward turmoil struggle but if you
[1:23:10] can say Lord I'll just let you have it
[1:23:13] I'll let you take it you'll take care of
[1:23:15] it he said he thou wilt keep him in
[1:23:18] perfect peace whose - stayed on thee
[1:23:21] because he trusted in the Lord your word
[1:23:23] says and I'll stand by whichever just
[1:23:26] Psalms 4:8
[1:23:29] I will both lay me down in peace and
[1:23:32] sleep for thou Lord only maketh me to
[1:23:35] dwell in safety at the night the end of
[1:23:40] the day you've done you've done all you
[1:23:44] can to do it right and if you did
[1:23:46] something wrong you made it right if you
[1:23:50] owed somebody you're restored to a child
[1:23:53] if you had a cross word you said I'm
[1:23:57] sorry because those things do happen
[1:23:59] sometimes now except for the rest of you
[1:24:03] who are all perfect angels I know well
[1:24:06] sometimes we things go you know I could
[1:24:08] have I walked into another house today
[1:24:11] and and I liked it when I get in there
[1:24:14] nobody's in there because then I don't
[1:24:15] have to listen to anybody else's radios
[1:24:18] so there was a big radio sitting on the
[1:24:20] countertop and it wasn't on I said thank
[1:24:22] you lord the guy's not in here or the
[1:24:25] people are not here so it's not blasting
[1:24:27] so I was about halfway done when he
[1:24:29] walked in and he turned it on and it's
[1:24:31] disgusting it's just I wanted to shoot
[1:24:35] the radio this time I didn't want shoot
[1:24:37] him I just wanted to shoot the radio but
[1:24:40] you know I'm like you know this is their
[1:24:43] God I don't have to lose my faith in my
[1:24:47] anger and get so upset because of this
[1:24:49] Lord you can keep me in perfect peace I
[1:24:53] don't have to be tormented by this
[1:24:56] afflicted by this I can think good
[1:24:59] things think on these things and turn my
[1:25:02] whole attitude around was that this
[1:25:05] guy's fault no but I could have got
[1:25:09] upset I could have said something to do
[1:25:10] it I could tell me I oh you know a turn
[1:25:12] there no I just changed my attitude
[1:25:15] forgot about the radio and that night I
[1:25:19] can lay my house down to sleep and
[1:25:22] and and and peace and sleep for the Lord
[1:25:25] only maketh me to dwell in safety in
[1:25:29] peace in tranquillity of mine resting
[1:25:32] securely upon God's promises not in my
[1:25:36] ability figured out my ability to make
[1:25:39] it work out but God said so and God
[1:25:42] keeps his word
[1:25:42] 1st Corinthians 14:33 for God is not the
[1:25:47] author of confusion but of peace as in
[1:25:51] all the churches of the saints that's me
[1:25:55] I'm in one of the churches of the saints
[1:25:58] is that you - Amen God is not the author
[1:26:02] of confusion when things are getting you
[1:26:05] know a distorted confused everything say
[1:26:07] hey God it's not you it must be me
[1:26:10] because you're not the author of
[1:26:12] confusion you're not the one that twists
[1:26:14] the mind up you're not the one that
[1:26:16] causes the angers on it that's all or to
[1:26:18] help me to catch that quickly and
[1:26:20] straighten it out as fast because that's
[1:26:22] in the churches of the saints and that's
[1:26:24] us Matthew of 5 9 blessed are the
[1:26:30] peacemakers for they shall be called the
[1:26:33] children of God amen
[1:26:37] lord help me to be a peacemaker help me
[1:26:41] to be one that doesn't want to create
[1:26:43] our SH attitude a harsh atmosphere but
[1:26:46] one that would say hey you know when I
[1:26:48] come around brother so-and-so when I'm
[1:26:50] around sit there's such a peace about it
[1:26:51] there's such a sweetness about it you've
[1:26:53] ever been to their home isn't there just
[1:26:55] a wonderful spirit of peace in their
[1:26:56] home
[1:26:57] let it be Lord Romans 12:18
[1:27:03] if it be possible as much as lieth in
[1:27:07] you live peaceably with all men
[1:27:11] oh goodness so there must be some times
[1:27:13] that it's not always possible some
[1:27:17] people refuse but you do your effort
[1:27:19] anyways yeah just different things
[1:27:22] happen you know as much as possible this
[1:27:27] is live peaceably with all men Hebrews
[1:27:31] 12:14

[1:27:38] to give to to to maybe to get peace with
[1:27:42] your neighbor don't lower your standards
[1:27:44] to make your neighbor happy well in
[1:27:48] order to get my neighbor happy I've got
[1:27:49] to do this and this and make him because
[1:27:50] he'll be happy if I'm like him he says
[1:27:52] follow peace with all men and holiness
[1:27:54] stay true to your calling but you can
[1:27:58] still be at peace without which no man
[1:28:01] shall see the Lord both holiness and
[1:28:04] peace he's peace himself if you have God
[1:28:07] there is peace in your life peace the
[1:28:10] absent of war you're not battling you're
[1:28:12] not fighting he is my peace he has
[1:28:15] broken down every wall and then in
[1:28:19] second Thessalonians 3:16 now the Lord
[1:28:23] of peace himself give you peace always
[1:28:27] by all means the Lord be with you
[1:28:32] amen you accept that raise your hands
[1:28:35] say the Lord be with me the Lord be with
[1:28:37] you all accept it he said the peace that
[1:28:41] he himself gives a peace sometimes that
[1:28:44] we can't understand a reason why but
[1:28:46] there's no reason to try to figure it
[1:28:47] out just say yes Lord it's so sweet to
[1:28:51] trust in Jesus
[1:28:52] he's unfailing he never fails he he he
[1:28:56] goes and does things that you just say
[1:28:58] Wow look how good he took care of that
[1:29:01] you know I walked down the street and
[1:29:05] and he's there to watching over me this
[1:29:07] situation happens he took care of me he
[1:29:10] answered it he met that need or whatever
[1:29:13] it is there's a peace knowing that God
[1:29:15] supply if every
[1:29:18] every need supplies yeah there's not oh
[1:29:22] my lord have you ever dealt with this
[1:29:24] lord have you ever had you have to run
[1:29:27] back to your laboratory and figure up
[1:29:29] another mixture or another vaccine no
[1:29:32] every need supplied he is our peace he
[1:29:36] has broken every wall he has caused the
[1:29:39] the love of God in us to want to treat
[1:29:43] others as he treated us not by the law
[1:29:48] the law says the day you fail you shall
[1:29:51] surely die God's justice says because I
[1:29:58] am a just God I could not take that in
[1:30:01] my presence in fact the high priest when
[1:30:05] he went back behind the veil what did he
[1:30:07] have he had the shed blood the blood of
[1:30:10] an innocent animal but he wear war bells
[1:30:13] and they had a rope tied around him and
[1:30:15] if he displeased the Lord at one second
[1:30:18] he was dead the Bell stopped they knew
[1:30:21] he wasn't alive he got dragged back out
[1:30:23] it was death to go in behind that veil
[1:30:27] wrong today it's death to stay outside
[1:30:32] of that path and not enter into his
[1:30:34] presence and receive the peace of God
[1:30:37] the grace of God the mercy of God the
[1:30:40] righteousness of God the ability to be
[1:30:43] godly is God in you not of ourselves I
[1:30:48] give it a go in the morning and I go for
[1:30:50] a little bit and then something goes
[1:30:52] wrong and then I'm down again but if I
[1:30:55] say Lord I'm going in your name you lead
[1:30:57] me you guide me go with me and watch him
[1:31:00] take care of the situation's Bible does
[1:31:04] say be angry and sin not so there's
[1:31:06] times you do get angry how many would
[1:31:10] say I've been angry before
[1:31:12] you know but he says send out make it
[1:31:15] right don't let the Sun go down on your
[1:31:17] anger don't let its - don't let it you
[1:31:19] know I've said it this way in and I said
[1:31:22] you know young couples when they first
[1:31:24] get married I say you know you will say
[1:31:26] something you will do something you will
[1:31:28] anger her you'll you'll make her upset
[1:31:30] over something make it right quickly as
[1:31:34] quick as you can and I said you know
[1:31:37] this get the peace back get that I said
[1:31:39] but it's a lot less expensive if you do
[1:31:41] it quickly and then my wife says they're
[1:31:45] probably wondering how many times you
[1:31:46] had to buy me something I said you know
[1:31:48] it's not so I just it's just an example
[1:31:50] because the longer it takes the more
[1:31:52] expensive it gets
[1:31:54] where if I would have just said I'm
[1:31:56] sorry it's usually okay that's all right
[1:31:58] but down the road isn't gonna cost me a
[1:32:01] bouquet of flowers it's going to cost me
[1:32:03] a dinner it's going to cost me it you
[1:32:07] know just the longer we hold on to
[1:32:09] something that greater the grudge
[1:32:11] becomes the greater the effect the more
[1:32:14] Ruby gets down it and gets harder to
[1:32:16] take out where if we will quickly say
[1:32:19] I'm sorry I didn't mean that
[1:32:22] I'm sorry us in the Lord and us and one
[1:32:25] another we're all part of the family of
[1:32:29] God
[1:32:29] let's care for one another let's
[1:32:32] encourage one another let's not look at
[1:32:34] and judge harshly because I want the
[1:32:37] mercy of God I want it for me I want it
[1:32:40] for you we are a part of the family of
[1:32:43] God and mercy rewrote my life if the
[1:32:47] musicians would come
[1:32:50] I'm glad for his mercy I'm glad for his
[1:32:54] grace because where would I be without
[1:32:57] it
[1:32:58] you know I sometimes I I do something
[1:33:02] and and I look at the girl's face and I
[1:33:04] don't blame him because sometimes you
[1:33:06] think I was 12 years old we act at home
[1:33:09] we get to do it in st. in there like
[1:33:10] come on dad grow up you know
[1:33:13] but they still love me they still care
[1:33:16] for me they'll still go out of their way
[1:33:18] to help me out you know they say well
[1:33:22] what would you have done with a son I
[1:33:24] said I don't know I have no idea I might
[1:33:27] have made him a little brat or a little
[1:33:29] of what you call spoiled brat I don't
[1:33:31] know maybe God knew I wouldn't be able
[1:33:33] to handle it but you know God gives us
[1:33:37] what he knows we can god loves us he
[1:33:40] cares for us mercy rewrote my life can
[1:33:45] you sing that to him in a in a in a way
[1:33:48] of just thanking him mercy

[1:35:03] Lord we don't come in a way that would
[1:35:07] want to tell you or say to your approach
[1:35:09] in a way as an Lord I'm your son so
[1:35:12] therefore I deserves we want to come as
[1:35:15] your children Lord but we also want to
[1:35:18] have an attitude and a heartless
[1:35:20] pleasing
[1:35:22] unspotted by the things of the world
[1:35:24] unspotted by the attitudes of the world
[1:35:27] and the things that cause frustration or
[1:35:31] but rather a peaceful spirit within this
[1:35:34] order a willingness to say we're sorry a
[1:35:37] willingness to make things right that
[1:35:39] need to be made right or not holding on
[1:35:42] to grudges or we're getting to a point
[1:35:45] or where it consumes us but lord quickly
[1:35:48] say lord help me help get past this and
[1:35:52] to love my neighbor as myself or my
[1:35:55] brother my sister the one I don't even

[1:36:00] the that one that was on the side of the
[1:36:02] road or hurt and injured it and not give
[1:36:05] them a wide berth but see if we can help
[1:36:07] take that attitude
[1:36:10] let our hearts be pleasing before you
[1:36:13] let our attitudes in it but you can look
[1:36:15] as su as you said of your own son this
[1:36:18] is my son my beloved son here he ain't

[1:36:30] look at it and it would please you learn
[1:36:33] or let that be in all of us Lord in
