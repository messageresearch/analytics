[1:05:12] [Music]
[1:05:25] amen
[1:05:43] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[1:05:45] this morning amen
[1:05:50] I was in the back
[1:05:52] and as brother Jonathan was singing
[1:05:56] I was in the back and uh
[1:05:58] we're seeing an Amazing Grace
[1:06:02] and he he got to one part of the song
[1:06:07] and I just I felt the spirit of the Lord
[1:06:11] come in the room back there and I
[1:06:13] started raising my hand
[1:06:15] and I started praising and I started
[1:06:17] weeping and then I heard the response
[1:06:20] come from the audience I heard I heard
[1:06:23] the Applause come from the audience I
[1:06:25] could tell that the Lord was moving all
[1:06:28] over the place and it's just such a
[1:06:29] blessing to see that he's moving in
[1:06:32] there he's moving out here and he's
[1:06:34] moving among his people
[1:06:37] I was I think last Sunday
[1:06:40] we had a tremendous tremendous day
[1:06:44] and and I believe that it was
[1:06:48] because
[1:06:49] that I think we got something right
[1:06:53] and and I believe I know what that is
[1:06:57] and um I want to continue that along
[1:07:01] um so much so much so that that a
[1:07:04] brother
[1:07:05] that uh he had a prophecy that came on
[1:07:08] his heart brother John back there in a
[1:07:10] prophecy a a word for the church that
[1:07:12] came upon his heart and and we know that
[1:07:15] these things have to be given in order
[1:07:19] we know that the Bible says that that
[1:07:22] the spirit of the Prophet is subject to
[1:07:25] the prophet that means the person that
[1:07:27] is giving the prophecy or giving the the
[1:07:29] message in tongues that it doesn't just
[1:07:31] overtake you and you have to jump up and
[1:07:33] give it and interrupt the service that's
[1:07:36] not the way that's not in order but you
[1:07:39] have control over that
[1:07:41] and brother John the spirit of the Lord
[1:07:43] came upon him and he felt that it wasn't
[1:07:47] the right time to give it
[1:07:50] because the Holy Spirit was leading
[1:07:52] but he gave maybe uh maybe brother John
[1:07:56] one time that you you could tell us but
[1:07:59] uh it was basically that the Lord was
[1:08:01] pleased with our worship
[1:08:04] yes
[1:08:05] yes
[1:08:13] and I believe I know why
[1:08:16] and I'll talk a little bit about that
[1:08:18] about that today
[1:08:20] um
[1:08:21] I want to greet our visitors

[1:11:31] I do appreciate I appreciate the Lord
[1:11:34] Jesus and um if we can stand just just
[1:11:37] one more time I'd like to I'd like to
[1:11:40] read just a portion of his word and this
[1:11:42] is in the Book of Matthew
[1:11:44] chapter 22
[1:11:46] this is our lord Jesus speaking we'll
[1:11:48] start with verse 19.
[1:11:54] this is our lord Jesus talking
[1:11:57] he says
[1:11:59] show me the tribute money
[1:12:02] and they brought unto him a penny
[1:12:04] and he said unto them whose is this
[1:12:07] image in the superscription
[1:12:10] and they said unto him it's Caesar's
[1:12:13] then he said unto them render therefore
[1:12:15] under Caesar the things which are
[1:12:17] Caesars and unto God
[1:12:20] the things that are God's
[1:12:22] let's bow our heads
[1:12:26] Heavenly Father
[1:12:28] I know it's just a short scripture and
[1:12:31] but Lord It's the words of the son of
[1:12:34] God
[1:12:35] we never want to take them lightly
[1:12:38] father we pray that that you would be
[1:12:40] with us that your spirit would be with
[1:12:41] us for the remainder of this service
[1:12:44] and Lord that wisdom would come forward
[1:12:47] and father that we would learn more
[1:12:49] about you word more about you
[1:12:51] that we would receive correction Lord to
[1:12:54] help us through our lives in Jesus name
[1:12:57] amen God bless you all you can take your
[1:13:00] seeds
[1:13:03] I want to lay a foundation
[1:13:06] to what the Lord Jesus is is talking
[1:13:09] about here so if if you come on
[1:13:12] Wednesday night or if you stream in you
[1:13:14] know that there's that there's three
[1:13:17] different
[1:13:19] um divisions
[1:13:20] of Judaism at this time of the Lord
[1:13:23] Jesus there's the Pharisees
[1:13:26] there's the Sadducees and then there's
[1:13:28] the herodians now these Pharisees
[1:13:30] they're the they're the group they're
[1:13:32] like the the local pastors that are Out
[1:13:35] Among the people and and they believe
[1:13:37] they're a more liberal liberal group
[1:13:39] they believed in the moving of the
[1:13:41] spirit they believed in a resurrection
[1:13:44] they believed in healing of the sick
[1:13:45] they believed in the gifts and then we
[1:13:48] have over here we have the Sadducees and
[1:13:50] they're the temple worshipers they're
[1:13:52] the ones that work in this Temple and
[1:13:55] they are kind of the stuck up uh group
[1:13:59] that they're better than everybody else
[1:14:00] and and they don't really believe in in
[1:14:04] any type of uh of really moving of the
[1:14:07] spirit they don't believe in a
[1:14:08] resurrection they're they're really a
[1:14:10] legalistic group and then we have this
[1:14:13] group that we haven't talked too much
[1:14:15] about and they're called the herodians
[1:14:17] now you know from the name
[1:14:20] that the herodians follow this man's
[1:14:23] name Herod
[1:14:25] so what they did is they supported Herod
[1:14:28] and and going through their lives and in
[1:14:32] growing up under under the rulership of
[1:14:35] Rome
[1:14:36] they laid their support to this leader
[1:14:39] this Jewish leader named Herod and Herod
[1:14:42] was in League with the Roman Empire
[1:14:46] he was kind of hand placed there and
[1:14:48] Herod Herod was a powerful man a very
[1:14:50] capable man he built he built great
[1:14:53] works and and he is the one that was
[1:14:56] tasked with rebuilding the temple
[1:14:59] so Herod was a very very important and
[1:15:01] very powerful man at the time and we see
[1:15:04] that this group that followed him they
[1:15:07] were probably a more worldly crowd they
[1:15:09] were they didn't probably have a lot of
[1:15:11] deep understanding but they thought some
[1:15:14] of them thought that maybe this Herod or
[1:15:17] maybe the next Herod or the next Herod
[1:15:19] these group of herods maybe that this
[1:15:22] could be the Messiah
[1:15:24] because
[1:15:26] Herod was bringing a peaceful
[1:15:30] relationship between Rome and Israel
[1:15:34] so there are some people that thought
[1:15:36] maybe this Herod could be this Messiah
[1:15:39] so when we get to this scripture
[1:15:43] Matthew 22 and we'll start with verse
[1:15:46] 15.
[1:15:47] when we get to this scripture we see
[1:15:50] that that there's these three different
[1:15:53] groups of people right now we'll be
[1:15:55] talking about the Pharisees
[1:15:57] and the herodians and then later on we
[1:16:00] won't get to that the Sadducees come
[1:16:03] into play in this same chapter so let's
[1:16:05] let's start with verse 16 and chapter 22
[1:16:09] of the Book of Matthew
[1:16:11] then went the Pharisees
[1:16:15] then went to Pharisees and took counsel
[1:16:18] how they might entangle him in his talk
[1:16:20] verse 16. and they sent out unto him
[1:16:24] their disciples with the herodians
[1:16:26] saying Master we know that thou art true
[1:16:29] and teach us the way of God in truth
[1:16:32] neither careth thou for any man for thou
[1:16:35] regard us not the person of men so what
[1:16:39] they're doing is they're kind of trying
[1:16:40] to pump up Jesus here
[1:16:42] they're trying to say oh you're great
[1:16:45] you know you're you're a man that that
[1:16:47] you you're not swayed one way or the
[1:16:50] other with your doctrines and stuff and
[1:16:52] and they're they're kind of trying to
[1:16:54] get on his good side what they're doing
[1:16:55] is they're setting him up
[1:16:57] for failure
[1:17:00] but we know somebody that doesn't fail
[1:17:03] so they're trying to build his trust
[1:17:05] they're trying to pump them up and now
[1:17:07] remember these herodians they support
[1:17:09] Rome
[1:17:12] so the next question is a loaded
[1:17:15] question from the herodians tell us
[1:17:18] therefore what thinketh thou
[1:17:21] is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar
[1:17:24] or not
[1:17:26] now
[1:17:27] Jesus they're looking to for something
[1:17:30] to get him killed and if they could pin
[1:17:33] him being disrespectful to Caesar in
[1:17:37] causing an uprising that would be a
[1:17:40] quick way to get the Roman Empire on
[1:17:42] your side to kill this man Jesus
[1:17:45] but Jesus perceived their wickedness
[1:17:48] and said why tempt ye me ye hypocrites
[1:17:53] show me the tribute money and they
[1:17:56] brought unto him a penny
[1:17:58] it wasn't a penny by our standards it
[1:18:00] was a unit of of currency that it was
[1:18:03] worth a lot more than a penny
[1:18:05] so they they brought him this coin
[1:18:09] and he saith unto them whose is this
[1:18:12] image in this superscription and they
[1:18:14] said unto him it's Caesar's so Caesar
[1:18:17] was printed on this coin
[1:18:19] then saith he unto them rendered
[1:18:22] therefore unto Caesar the things which
[1:18:23] are Caesars and unto God the things that
[1:18:27] are gods and when they heard these words
[1:18:29] they marveled and left him and they went
[1:18:32] their way now the scripture is usually
[1:18:34] used in a way to encourage a Christian
[1:18:37] to follow the laws of the land to pay
[1:18:40] your taxes and and to uh to just just to
[1:18:43] be a good law-abiding citizen which it
[1:18:45] should be it does it does very plainly
[1:18:47] say that to give to Render unto Caesars
[1:18:50] what Caesars to follow the law to pay
[1:18:52] your taxes don't don't be a bad
[1:18:54] Christian don't be a bad citizen do
[1:18:57] those things
[1:18:58] and then a lot of ministers will take
[1:19:01] that and also they will apply that and
[1:19:04] unto God's what's Gods they'll they'll
[1:19:06] apply that to paying tithes in church
[1:19:08] and and taking and doing the offering
[1:19:11] and that which we know that the word
[1:19:14] tithe basically it just means a tenth
[1:19:17] and and then we have an offering and
[1:19:20] that offering is above and beyond your
[1:19:23] obligation as a as a tithe so it's
[1:19:25] basically what you want to do and what
[1:19:28] we're going to start doing here in the
[1:19:29] church is we're going to be starting to
[1:19:30] maybe take these offerings and doing
[1:19:33] projects that we need to like the
[1:19:35] projects that you know for our youth
[1:19:37] um in in the other in the annex there
[1:19:40] and other things like that so much of
[1:19:43] the time that is what the ministers
[1:19:45] Minister on but I don't think
[1:19:46] necessarily this scripture really says
[1:19:49] that
[1:19:50] it does say to give unto Caesar what's
[1:19:53] Caesar's but when it says to give to God
[1:19:58] what's God it doesn't it's not talking
[1:20:01] anything about the money
[1:20:03] it's it's making Jesus is making this
[1:20:07] broad statement and that statement was
[1:20:10] so profound
[1:20:13] that it says that that they were just
[1:20:16] basically in awe of what he said and
[1:20:19] then they went their way
[1:20:21] so when he's saying give unto God what
[1:20:25] is God what did the Lord mean when he
[1:20:28] was saying that
[1:20:29] was he talking about money
[1:20:32] or was he talking about something else
[1:20:34] and that's what I that's why I want to
[1:20:36] talk about this morning is is give unto
[1:20:38] God
[1:20:40] the Bible
[1:20:41] says in second Corinthians chapter 4
[1:20:46] that the devil is the God of this evil
[1:20:51] world
[1:20:52] and we look and we
[1:20:54] we
[1:20:55] are obligated to give and and to follow
[1:20:59] the laws and that and we should but we
[1:21:02] have to remember that that this is not
[1:21:06] God
[1:21:08] that this is Satan's World Satan is the
[1:21:12] one that has has said 6 000 years to
[1:21:16] create this world and now it's just full
[1:21:18] of sin
[1:21:20] but yet there is a God there and there
[1:21:22] is a God that made prom made promises
[1:21:25] and this man Jesus Christ came to
[1:21:29] fulfill those promises and to make it to
[1:21:32] where we are not dependent on this world
[1:21:35] anymore
[1:21:38] the God of this world tempts us with
[1:21:42] every type of sin and each of us are
[1:21:44] different each of us have weaknesses
[1:21:46] each of us fail in different ways and I
[1:21:50] don't think one any more than any other
[1:21:52] really
[1:21:53] all of us have failed and come short of
[1:21:56] the glory of God in all of us
[1:21:59] are bound for a place called hell
[1:22:02] without our lord Jesus
[1:22:05] that's a fact it's a hard thing to say
[1:22:07] and it's a hard thing to think about but
[1:22:09] without Christ we will not we won't go
[1:22:14] you know I think about making a
[1:22:17] commitment to the Lord
[1:22:19] and I think I see so much that people
[1:22:22] will get married
[1:22:24] and they'll they'll make this commitment
[1:22:28] to this man or to this woman
[1:22:31] For Better or For Worse
[1:22:34] and and as long as things are going good
[1:22:36] as long as things are are are happy and
[1:22:39] all is well in the home that they they
[1:22:42] will they will keep that that commitment
[1:22:44] but then when things get hard they
[1:22:46] really quickly forget about the four
[1:22:48] worst part
[1:22:49] and that's that's they break that
[1:22:53] commitment and that's why we see so many
[1:22:55] problems in our society today we see so
[1:22:57] many problems in the church is because
[1:22:59] they enter into these decisions
[1:23:00] haphazardly not really willing
[1:23:04] to do what they say and to stay loyal to
[1:23:07] this person and and to give their life
[1:23:10] to this person
[1:23:11] and it ends up in hardship it ends up in
[1:23:16] suffering for the people for the
[1:23:17] families
[1:23:19] God doesn't want us to suffer as I say
[1:23:21] many times we have to know the reason
[1:23:23] when God sets these rules for us there's
[1:23:26] a reason behind them and he's basically
[1:23:29] saying listen if you enter into this
[1:23:31] lightly and you divorce this man you're
[1:23:34] going to have all kinds of problems down
[1:23:36] the road you're going to get into a
[1:23:38] lawsuit you're going to have to split
[1:23:40] everything you're going to hate each
[1:23:41] other the kids are going to have to
[1:23:43] split there's all kinds of problems
[1:23:45] associated it's better to enter into it
[1:23:46] the first time the right way
[1:23:48] and to make that commitment I was
[1:23:51] commitments are important
[1:23:54] and when we talk about being a Christian
[1:23:56] we make this commitment to the Lord we
[1:23:58] go up and we're baptized but that
[1:24:01] doesn't stop there I made a commitment
[1:24:04] in like January
[1:24:07] I was like 217 pounds
[1:24:10] and I said man I Gotta Lose I got to get
[1:24:13] down to 205. I got to lose 12 pounds and
[1:24:16] I made that commitment and I said I'm
[1:24:18] gonna I'm gonna do it I'm gonna start
[1:24:20] dieting and I'm going to I'm going to
[1:24:21] get down to this 205 which is my that's
[1:24:24] my fighting weight that's that's the
[1:24:26] weight that I want to be at so that was
[1:24:29] that was like six months ago and I
[1:24:32] weighed myself last night and I was 2
[1:24:35] 23.
[1:24:39] a lot of good that commitment did
[1:24:42] it didn't do anything
[1:24:44] and we see with with so much with with
[1:24:47] Christians we we get it we get excited
[1:24:50] and we want to do it and we want to make
[1:24:51] that commitment and we make that
[1:24:53] commitment and then we don't stick with
[1:24:55] it what good does it do
[1:24:57] it doesn't do any good
[1:24:59] and it's the same thing with with a
[1:25:01] church it's the same thing with the
[1:25:03] Friendship it's the same thing with the
[1:25:05] Merit a marriage we make a commitment
[1:25:07] that is when the work starts
[1:25:11] it doesn't just stop right there
[1:25:14] it that's what begins this commitment of
[1:25:17] being a Christian in Romans chapter 1
[1:25:21] verse 20 it says for the invisible
[1:25:23] things of him from the creation of the
[1:25:26] world are clearly seen being understood
[1:25:28] by the things that are that are made
[1:25:31] even as eternal power in Godhead
[1:25:34] so that they are without excuse
[1:25:39] so there's no excuses
[1:25:41] friends once we once we hear about
[1:25:45] Christ there aren't and especially in
[1:25:48] today's world there's no excuses for us
[1:25:51] not living this life
[1:25:54] it's been laid out right before us
[1:25:57] the Lord has has given us this this free
[1:26:01] gift and he says all you have to do is
[1:26:03] accept it we make that decision but just
[1:26:06] like me and my diet man I didn't stick
[1:26:08] to it it didn't do any good
[1:26:12] we have to stay that course yes we fail
[1:26:16] yes we do things wrong but it doesn't
[1:26:19] end in baptism
[1:26:22] it doesn't end when you make a vow
[1:26:25] it continues on it really continues
[1:26:27] until the day you die
[1:26:30] constantly constantly seeking the Lord
[1:26:33] constantly trying to do things that are
[1:26:35] right
[1:26:36] but I will tell you
[1:26:38] once you are filled
[1:26:41] with that Spirit of Christ once you have
[1:26:45] that new birth then you are sealed
[1:26:49] until the day of your Redemption as the
[1:26:52] Bible says you are sealed there and even
[1:26:54] though you stray
[1:26:57] you still are going to come back but
[1:26:59] when we stray we make it harder on
[1:27:02] ourselves and we suffer in this life but
[1:27:04] you're saved you are a child of God
[1:27:06] you're going to end up there but the
[1:27:09] decisions that we make just make life
[1:27:11] harder we were we had a youth camp
[1:27:14] and there was this young man and he uh
[1:27:16] he came and
[1:27:18] he um just didn't have a good attitude
[1:27:23] so day after day I really reached out to
[1:27:26] him and I tried to
[1:27:27] spend some time with him and talk about
[1:27:30] the Lord and he didn't want anything to
[1:27:31] do with it his parents made him go
[1:27:34] he was I don't know 18 years old or so
[1:27:37] and then at the last day
[1:27:40] we had a um we had our service
[1:27:46] and
[1:27:47] after the service was over
[1:27:50] people started filing out all the young
[1:27:52] people I don't know 150 of them or
[1:27:54] whatever it was 200. they started filing
[1:27:57] out
[1:27:58] and then this young man he stayed in his
[1:28:01] seat
[1:28:03] and he had his head down
[1:28:06] so I I stayed and he was the last one
[1:28:10] there in the church
[1:28:13] so
[1:28:14] I went over and I sat next to him and I
[1:28:16] put my hand on him and
[1:28:19] and he tells me says I can't do it
[1:28:22] I said I said okay
[1:28:25] I said well and we had to move they were
[1:28:27] they were doing some work in the in the
[1:28:29] um it was a tent a big a big tent so we
[1:28:32] had to move into another tent another
[1:28:34] big uh like a worship tent so we go into
[1:28:37] that one it's just him and me
[1:28:39] and and we're talking
[1:28:42] and
[1:28:43] he says I I just can't do it he says I
[1:28:46] can't give up
[1:28:47] and it was a girl
[1:28:50] and she was uh
[1:28:53] she wasn't a a good girl and he knew it
[1:28:56] and he says I just I can't do it I can't
[1:28:58] give it up so we continue to talk and
[1:29:01] and I said I said brother I said we'll
[1:29:04] just we'll just keep on you know and and
[1:29:07] um he didn't want to leave he wanted to
[1:29:08] continue there and pray so so it was I
[1:29:11] mean time passed
[1:29:13] and
[1:29:15] he says he says I I just I can't make
[1:29:18] that decision and I said okay I'll tell
[1:29:20] you what I said I said Do You Believe on
[1:29:23] the Lord Jesus Christ he said yes I said
[1:29:25] then the Bible says that if you believe
[1:29:27] on the Lord Jesus Christ that you're
[1:29:29] saved and he says he says okay and I
[1:29:33] said I said do you make that decision he
[1:29:35] says he says he says yeah he says okay
[1:29:37] he says maybe I should go get baptized I
[1:29:39] said well I said that's that's good
[1:29:41] um if you want to go get baptized and he
[1:29:43] says he says but I just feel something I
[1:29:46] said what you feel is not that you want
[1:29:49] your salvation what you feel is you are
[1:29:52] Desiring that the Holy Spirit would
[1:29:54] enter you and that you would receive a
[1:29:57] new birth in Christ and that you would
[1:30:00] be a new person I said that is what you
[1:30:02] are Desiring
[1:30:04] and he said that's right
[1:30:06] he says but I can't do it
[1:30:08] and I said okay I said I'll tell you
[1:30:10] what I won't tell anybody
[1:30:13] I said everybody sees us in here we're
[1:30:14] praying together I said they're all
[1:30:16] getting baptized I said I won't tell
[1:30:18] anybody I'll just say that that you gave
[1:30:20] your heart to the Lord
[1:30:22] and he said no and I knew he was going
[1:30:24] to say no I wasn't oh I wasn't I knew
[1:30:27] what the answer was going to be
[1:30:29] so we sat there for a little while
[1:30:33] he was sitting back
[1:30:34] one day I believe he'll be in this
[1:30:36] church
[1:30:38] he was sitting back
[1:30:40] leaning back in his chair
[1:30:43] and he leaned forward
[1:30:46] and he said I'll do it
[1:30:49] and when he said that this Spirit came
[1:30:54] in to that tent and it was the most
[1:30:57] powerful experience to this day that I
[1:31:01] have ever experienced in my life
[1:31:06] because he made that decision he said
[1:31:09] I'll do it
[1:31:12] and he we walked out we prayed and we
[1:31:14] walked out of that tent he goes brother
[1:31:16] Daniel he said look how green the grass
[1:31:17] is
[1:31:19] he said look at how beautiful the trees
[1:31:21] are he said look at how beautiful the
[1:31:22] sky is
[1:31:23] and I said yeah brother I said the Holy
[1:31:26] Spirit feels good doesn't he says he
[1:31:27] says oh and I felt that I knew that that
[1:31:30] Holy Spirit came in and filled that
[1:31:33] young man I knew it I could feel it it
[1:31:35] was it was beyond
[1:31:37] there was in no doubt
[1:31:39] so he goes on and he continues to serve
[1:31:42] the Lord
[1:31:44] and I gave him a testimony and I said be
[1:31:48] careful
[1:31:49] I said I'm not saying that this young
[1:31:51] lady that you're with is not the right
[1:31:55] one you're supposed to be with because I
[1:31:56] don't know but be careful because she
[1:32:00] will want to keep you and she will
[1:32:02] probably say what you want to hear and
[1:32:05] he said God told me that she's the wrong
[1:32:07] one
[1:32:09] I said okay
[1:32:12] the Lord showed him a scripture I'll be
[1:32:14] specific he showed him a scripture that
[1:32:17] Solomon failed because he went with
[1:32:21] idolater women
[1:32:24] the Lord showed him that scripture and
[1:32:26] he said brother Daniel I know time went
[1:32:28] on
[1:32:30] he was serving the lord he was doing
[1:32:31] well and then this girl
[1:32:35] she says we'll all be I'll do whatever
[1:32:37] you want I'll I'll start going to church
[1:32:39] I'll do this and and I know God showed
[1:32:42] him not me God had already showed him
[1:32:45] that he was going to make a mistake that
[1:32:47] that if he if he brought this girl back
[1:32:49] and then finally he gave in
[1:32:54] and
[1:32:56] left the Lord
[1:32:58] left everything and had his life from
[1:33:03] that time has been just awful she left
[1:33:06] him of course
[1:33:08] she's gone another another woman comes
[1:33:10] into his life she's gone all of these
[1:33:13] problems that's that stemmed right from
[1:33:16] that one decision but let me tell you
[1:33:19] something it doesn't make him any less
[1:33:22] of a child of God
[1:33:23] the holy spirit filled that young man
[1:33:28] sealed him and he backslid
[1:33:32] he made a mistake
[1:33:34] and all of us
[1:33:36] can make a mistake all of us can do the
[1:33:38] same thing
[1:33:41] I am
[1:33:44] when Jesus said
[1:33:46] when he said you give unto God what is
[1:33:50] God's he wasn't talking about your money
[1:33:54] he wasn't talking about your car he
[1:33:57] wasn't talking about your job he was
[1:33:59] talking about every single thing in your
[1:34:03] life
[1:34:04] everything
[1:34:06] you give to God what is God's
[1:34:12] and if you don't
[1:34:14] you may still be a child of God you may
[1:34:16] be sealed with the Holy Spirit but
[1:34:18] you're gonna have problems
[1:34:20] you're going to suffer in life because
[1:34:22] you are his if you're not his then no
[1:34:25] you won't suffer everything will go on
[1:34:28] just fine
[1:34:29] and and and you'll you'll divorce and
[1:34:32] and and remarry with this one divorce
[1:34:34] without remember everything will be
[1:34:36] going great and and you'll you'll be out
[1:34:38] partying with your friends and
[1:34:39] everything will be fine and your life
[1:34:41] will just line up perfectly but there
[1:34:43] won't be any desire in you to serve God
[1:34:47] but the real true
[1:34:49] servant of the Lord
[1:34:51] you're going to suffer
[1:34:54] and it is better to suffer here on Earth
[1:34:56] than it is to suffer at that day of
[1:34:59] judgment
[1:35:03] the um let's read let's read another
[1:35:05] another scripture Luke
[1:35:07] let's go to Matthew chapter 10.
[1:35:10] verse 34.
[1:35:12] Jesus says this he says think not that I
[1:35:15] am come to send peace on Earth I came
[1:35:17] not to send peace but a sword for I am
[1:35:20] come to set a man at variance against
[1:35:22] his father and daughter
[1:35:25] against her mother and daughter-in-law
[1:35:28] against her mother-in-law
[1:35:32] he says here I require everything
[1:35:37] if it splits up
[1:35:38] you and your husband if it splits up you
[1:35:41] and your kids if it splits up your mom
[1:35:43] your dad or whatever
[1:35:45] it must be Christ he is more important
[1:35:49] than anything and it see I'm always
[1:35:51] talking about unity and how we should be
[1:35:52] together and we should love one another
[1:35:54] which is the case it's all through the
[1:35:56] Bible and we should but when it comes
[1:35:58] down to that thing do I make that
[1:36:00] decision that I choose Christ or I
[1:36:03] choose this you have to choose Christ
[1:36:09] it says here
[1:36:12] and a man's foes shall be they of his
[1:36:15] own household
[1:36:16] he that loveth father or mother more
[1:36:18] than me is not worthy of me and he that
[1:36:21] loveth son or daughter more than me is
[1:36:23] not worthy of me
[1:36:25] and he that taketh not his cross and
[1:36:28] followeth after me is not worthy of me I
[1:36:30] think about how much I love my kids when
[1:36:32] they were born
[1:36:34] and I would have done I would have died
[1:36:36] a hundred thousand times over
[1:36:39] for either one of my kids those precious
[1:36:42] little things and growing up and how how
[1:36:45] good of a relationship we have and how
[1:36:47] much of a blessing they've been to me
[1:36:49] and how much how much love we've had in
[1:36:50] our family but Jesus required he says if
[1:36:53] you love them more than you love me
[1:36:54] you're not worthy of me
[1:36:57] think about how much we love
[1:36:59] our family members our children our
[1:37:01] parents
[1:37:02] but we should love Christ more than that
[1:37:05] that and we we can't love him unless we
[1:37:07] know him
[1:37:10] I uh
[1:37:14] for time's sake
[1:37:16] we'll uh we'll move forward I just
[1:37:20] on those lines
[1:37:22] we all sin
[1:37:24] we all sin and we all come short of the
[1:37:26] glory of God that's in the Bible
[1:37:28] and we think that that maybe that well
[1:37:31] Lord I would give you everything I would
[1:37:33] do I would do whatever it takes
[1:37:35] but
[1:37:37] are we there yet I don't think any of us
[1:37:39] are there yet
[1:37:40] and if you think you're there then
[1:37:43] there's a problem
[1:37:44] if you don't see your sins if you don't
[1:37:46] see what you're doing wrong then there's
[1:37:48] a problem in your life
[1:37:52] says give unto Caesar those things that
[1:37:55] are Caesar's but give unto God what is
[1:37:58] God's
[1:38:00] and I think that
[1:38:02] that's hard for us to do every day
[1:38:05] what if it's if it's not money
[1:38:08] what if it's if it's not your time what
[1:38:11] if it's a position in a church
[1:38:13] what if it's if it's a a relationship
[1:38:17] with a husband or a wife that that
[1:38:19] sometimes you have to take
[1:38:21] the lower place to to avoid a fight
[1:38:26] which things are more important
[1:38:28] those things that are gods
[1:38:31] I gave you an example
[1:38:32] of
[1:38:34] last week how I really believe
[1:38:38] that the Lord blessed us and if you were
[1:38:40] here everyone felt that Spirit now we
[1:38:44] had that was really the spirit was here
[1:38:47] and it was it was like God's doing
[1:38:51] something
[1:38:52] and it's something I've been praying and
[1:38:55] and Lord what is this and I think what
[1:38:59] it is it's so important in a minute I've
[1:39:01] talked with a few of you about it is our
[1:39:03] music in our church
[1:39:06] and we're and it's how important is that
[1:39:08] worship how important is that music and
[1:39:11] and we're moving forward in this
[1:39:13] direction and we're seeing the Lord
[1:39:14] start to bless it we need to be careful
[1:39:17] we don't want to go too far
[1:39:20] but we're moving I believe and and he
[1:39:23] came down
[1:39:24] and he was there with us
[1:39:26] in a in giving things to Caesar what are
[1:39:30] Caesars and giving things to God what
[1:39:32] are God what is God's music is meant for
[1:39:37] worship
[1:39:39] and music is a something that can be so
[1:39:44] deceptive
[1:39:45] it could be it can come in and slide in
[1:39:48] and bring in spirits that that will
[1:39:51] destroy a family they'll destroy your
[1:39:54] life and it comes in maybe through this
[1:39:56] music and so many times I've been you
[1:39:59] know I'm listening I listened to the
[1:40:00] music on on the radio the Christian
[1:40:02] music and then and then I'll go in a
[1:40:04] place and it's like is that Christian or
[1:40:06] is that not
[1:40:09] it should be separate there should be a
[1:40:11] spirit that that's with that and and if
[1:40:14] we can't tell
[1:40:16] if it's the world with some of the
[1:40:19] things that they say or Christian
[1:40:22] if we just listen for the words there's
[1:40:24] something wrong
[1:40:26] So Daniel and I were we were driving
[1:40:30] and uh
[1:40:32] we were we were talking and Daniel was
[1:40:34] talking about
[1:40:36] some somehow a song came up and and I
[1:40:38] don't remember I don't have no idea what
[1:40:40] the song was but Daniel made this
[1:40:42] statement
[1:40:44] he said well Dad he said it's a clean
[1:40:45] song it wasn't that he was listening to
[1:40:47] it but it was something that that um I
[1:40:49] forgot what we're talking about but but
[1:40:51] Daniel's made this statement he said
[1:40:52] it's a clean song
[1:40:54] it's like a clean song
[1:40:56] that's a that's a strange thing to say
[1:40:59] so it really made me start thinking what
[1:41:01] does that mean a clean song and and and
[1:41:05] I know you young people especially
[1:41:07] there's filth that's that's that is just
[1:41:11] it's just piped in to us and so I was
[1:41:15] thinking a clean song so we Daniel and I
[1:41:17] go in somewhere and the radio's gone
[1:41:20] and uh
[1:41:22] I hear this
[1:41:25] statement
[1:41:28] that
[1:41:29] it said take me to church
[1:41:33] and I was like oh
[1:41:35] okay
[1:41:36] you know this is good so I couldn't
[1:41:39] really hear it and uh I was trying to
[1:41:41] pick out some words and it was kind of a
[1:41:43] catchy tune so
[1:41:47] I was that was on my mind a clean song
[1:41:49] and then I was listening listening
[1:41:51] trying to trying to hear because it was
[1:41:52] just a public place and I couldn't
[1:41:54] really hear the hear the music so I'm
[1:41:57] thinking on that and then and I'm
[1:41:59] thinking
[1:42:00] that music is such a way to introduce
[1:42:06] sin not only into our own personal lives
[1:42:08] but into society as a whole
[1:42:11] there's a song
[1:42:12] that if you listen to some of the old
[1:42:15] some of the sermons you've heard brother
[1:42:18] Branham talk about this song in the
[1:42:20] 1920s that made such an impact
[1:42:24] on society let me read you some of the
[1:42:27] things that it says it's meant it's by a
[1:42:29] man named Billy Murray in the 1920s now
[1:42:31] this is Brother Brahms ERA this is when
[1:42:33] he grew up listen to this
[1:42:36] it says this listen girls
[1:42:38] listen girls I have a word for you
[1:42:42] because you're up to date and do the
[1:42:45] things you do don't let anyone tell you
[1:42:48] that you don't act nice while you're as
[1:42:51] sweet as grandma was so take my advice
[1:42:53] and then it goes on to the chorus which
[1:42:56] is roll them girls roll them go ahead
[1:42:58] and roll them so what it was back then
[1:43:00] in the 1920s that they would have the
[1:43:03] short skirts and then they would have
[1:43:04] these um
[1:43:05] pantyhose things
[1:43:07] and then sorry sis I don't know what
[1:43:09] they're called
[1:43:12] yeah and then they would roll them down
[1:43:15] and this song
[1:43:17] was about
[1:43:20] encouraging these young ladies to show
[1:43:22] off their bodies and to and to present
[1:43:25] themselves in this way and it says this
[1:43:28] roll them high or low just as you please
[1:43:30] don't let people tell you that it's
[1:43:33] shocking paint your sweeties pictures on
[1:43:35] your stockings
[1:43:37] laugh at Ma laugh at Paul give them all
[1:43:40] the ha ha ha
[1:43:42] roll them girls roll them roll your own
[1:43:44] roll them girls go ahead and roll them
[1:43:48] listen girls listen girls when you
[1:43:50] bobbed your hair you were criticized a
[1:43:52] lot but you still didn't care when you
[1:43:54] shortened your dresses you gave you gave
[1:43:57] some some shocks but we never thought
[1:44:00] that soon you'd be wearing socks
[1:44:03] roll them girls in the winter in the
[1:44:05] summer spring or fall roll them roll
[1:44:07] them everybody roll them anywhere
[1:44:08] anytime or any place at all young girls
[1:44:10] old girls sweethearts wives mothers
[1:44:12] young Maids old maids even our
[1:44:14] grandmothers high or low rain or snow
[1:44:16] girls must be stylish roll them girls
[1:44:18] roll your own so we look at that and
[1:44:21] this was this was a way
[1:44:24] for to introduce
[1:44:28] unclean living
[1:44:30] back then it was a way to introduce that
[1:44:33] that these women and these men would
[1:44:35] start acting promiscuous from a dirty
[1:44:39] old man
[1:44:41] wanting the women to do that him wanting
[1:44:44] to see that
[1:44:46] so so this goes on
[1:44:48] and we see that we we see the the
[1:44:51] immorality start to start to come about
[1:44:53] through the history and we see the
[1:44:55] sexual Revolution come up we see in the
[1:44:57] 60s and all of these problems and all of
[1:44:59] it was just to hurt us
[1:45:01] like I said we we act in a way we
[1:45:04] shouldn't and then we just bring
[1:45:05] problems on us
[1:45:07] God loves us
[1:45:09] and you have to understand why that that
[1:45:11] he doesn't want us to live immorally
[1:45:15] so then we're in this
[1:45:19] Place me and Daniel and I'm listening to
[1:45:21] this song
[1:45:23] and it says take me to church and I was
[1:45:25] like oh that's kind of a catchy tune I
[1:45:27] want to see what this is
[1:45:30] young people probably know what it is
[1:45:33] but uh I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you what
[1:45:34] it is
[1:45:36] um
[1:45:36] it says this now this is just one of the
[1:45:39] verses
[1:45:40] it says no Masters or Kings when the
[1:45:43] ritual begins
[1:45:45] there's no sweet or innocent innocence
[1:45:47] than our gentle sin
[1:45:50] in the madness in the soil of that sad
[1:45:53] Earthly scene only then I am human only
[1:45:57] then I am clean
[1:45:59] oh oh amen amen
[1:46:02] the song
[1:46:05] as I research it the song is about a
[1:46:08] homosexual relationship between two men
[1:46:12] absolute filth
[1:46:15] and bringing in this into society
[1:46:18] through music through worship when you
[1:46:21] are listening to something when you're
[1:46:22] listening to this music it is worship it
[1:46:25] is designed to worship God so when we
[1:46:27] are hearing these these things and we're
[1:46:29] listening to them it's a catchy tune but
[1:46:32] we are worshiping
[1:46:35] given to God what is God's let Caesar
[1:46:39] keep that
[1:46:41] so when we're when this this thing
[1:46:44] starts and being introduced and now
[1:46:47] we're seeing way back in the 1920s we
[1:46:50] see that and we see what it ended up
[1:46:52] with with broken homes and and half of
[1:46:54] the the people that that get married
[1:46:56] over half get divorced and and all of
[1:46:58] these problems and immorality that comes
[1:47:01] in and now we're seeing another move
[1:47:05] making fun
[1:47:07] of Christianity
[1:47:09] in this in this what this this song is
[1:47:13] saying saying that there is no sweeter
[1:47:16] innocence than our gentle sin
[1:47:20] filth
[1:47:21] and bringing this in and then our young
[1:47:24] people are hearing this and
[1:47:28] we don't understand they don't
[1:47:30] understand that this is bringing in
[1:47:33] problems
[1:47:35] and it's introducing I see it brothers
[1:47:37] and sisters I see
[1:47:39] friends that I love
[1:47:42] I see that their homes are now being
[1:47:45] busted up with that type of spirit
[1:47:51] sin and problems
[1:47:54] those those kids don't want to do that
[1:47:58] but they're being pressed by what my
[1:48:01] dirty old men
[1:48:04] I believe that's right
[1:48:06] you know I hear so many times they
[1:48:08] preach against the women this is because
[1:48:10] of men
[1:48:12] filthy dirty men
[1:48:15] I want to see this in society
[1:48:18] and I know it I know it's hard to say
[1:48:20] but it's true
[1:48:22] it's it's
[1:48:25] be careful what you listen to
[1:48:28] be careful
[1:48:31] how are you
[1:48:33] worship Daniel sang a song last week and
[1:48:37] it's friends I like the new songs if God
[1:48:40] can Inspire someone a hundred years ago
[1:48:43] he can Inspire someone today it's the
[1:48:45] same God
[1:48:47] so I know that we grew up in a certain
[1:48:49] era and that's the kind of songs that we
[1:48:51] want to hear and everything else is just
[1:48:52] wrong
[1:48:53] no
[1:48:55] it's just because that's what we like
[1:48:57] that's what we're used to
[1:48:58] but these new songs listen to these
[1:49:01] words in comparison
[1:49:03] there's a Grace when the Heart Is Under
[1:49:05] Fire
[1:49:06] another way when the walls are closing
[1:49:09] in and when I look at the space between
[1:49:11] where I used to be and this Reckoning I
[1:49:14] know I will never be alone
[1:49:17] there was another in the fire
[1:49:20] standing next to me he's re this song is
[1:49:23] written part of it is about those Hebrew
[1:49:26] children in the fiery furnace that they
[1:49:29] were there and then there was another
[1:49:30] one the Son of God protecting them
[1:49:34] he's standing next to me there was
[1:49:36] another in the waters holding back the
[1:49:38] Seas
[1:49:39] and should I never need reminding of how
[1:49:41] I've been set free there is a cross that
[1:49:44] bears the burden where another died for
[1:49:46] me
[1:49:49] all my debt
[1:49:51] left for dead beneath the waters I am no
[1:49:54] longer a slave to my sin anymore
[1:49:56] and should I fall in the space between
[1:49:58] what remains of me and this Reckoning
[1:50:01] either way I won't bow to the things of
[1:50:03] this world
[1:50:05] and I know I will never be alone
[1:50:07] I can see light in the darkness as the
[1:50:10] darkness bows to him I can hear the roar
[1:50:12] in the heavens and the space between
[1:50:14] where's thin I can feel the ground shake
[1:50:17] beneath this as the Prison Walls cave in
[1:50:19] nothing stands between us there is no
[1:50:22] another name there is no other name but
[1:50:24] the name of that is Jesus
[1:50:26] who was and still is and will be all
[1:50:29] through
[1:50:31] think about our worship
[1:50:34] our what what we do before the Lord are
[1:50:38] we giving our lives to Caesar are we
[1:50:42] giving our lives
[1:50:44] to the God of this world or are we
[1:50:47] giving our lives to Christ are we
[1:50:49] dedicating everything to him it's a
[1:50:51] question that we all need to answer
[1:50:55] give unto God what's God's
[1:50:58] let me ask you are you God's
[1:51:01] are you one of God's children
[1:51:04] then give unto God what is God
[1:51:08] give your life to God
[1:51:10] or
[1:51:12] are you Caesars the God of this evil
[1:51:14] world
[1:51:16] would you give your life to him
[1:51:18] just to build just to build make money
[1:51:20] and to build and to build some sort of
[1:51:22] an Empire for yourself so so that you
[1:51:25] can retire and that you can live easy
[1:51:26] and do all these things that is giving
[1:51:29] everything to Caesar what about God
[1:51:33] we forget him
[1:51:35] but Jesus here he says and that's why I
[1:51:37] was so profound he says give the money
[1:51:40] to Caesar it's his
[1:51:42] but give to God what is God's
[1:51:44] and that's what I want to do everything
[1:51:47] that's in me let me give my life let me
[1:51:49] give everything to the Lord and and I
[1:51:52] see that we say well we make mistakes we
[1:51:55] do these wrong things wrong never Point
[1:51:57] your finger at anyone else for making a
[1:51:59] mistake because you are as sinful as
[1:52:02] anyone else
[1:52:03] but by the grace of God
[1:52:06] he has elected you to come into His
[1:52:10] presence to allow his Spirit to dwell in
[1:52:12] within you
[1:52:14] her brother said quoted that scripture I
[1:52:17] believe is in Revelation
[1:52:19] about all of these angels around the
[1:52:23] throne
[1:52:25] Ten Thousand Times Ten thousands and
[1:52:27] thousands and thousands a hundred
[1:52:28] million Angels there circling around
[1:52:31] this Throne of Jesus and here comes the
[1:52:34] prophet
[1:52:35] the prophet Isaiah
[1:52:38] and here he comes between up to the
[1:52:41] throne and here is this a hundred
[1:52:44] million Angels going around and Isaiah
[1:52:47] comes and he says I am unclean I'm
[1:52:49] filthy
[1:52:51] he see he comes in the presence of God
[1:52:53] I'm I'm terrible and this is a prophet
[1:52:56] of God
[1:52:58] so when we feel
[1:52:59] how bad we are we should feel that way
[1:53:03] but remember when God looks down upon us
[1:53:06] he the
[1:53:08] um
[1:53:09] a brother sang that song he became me so
[1:53:12] that I might become him by grace
[1:53:15] it's we can't become Jesus
[1:53:18] but when God looks down he doesn't see
[1:53:21] our sinful ways he doesn't see us he
[1:53:25] sees the blood of Jesus Christ but we
[1:53:28] have to make that commitment
[1:53:30] we have to accept Christ
[1:53:33] and we have to be careful
[1:53:35] of all of these
[1:53:37] things coming in to destroy us you young
[1:53:40] people
[1:53:41] the devil is after you
[1:53:44] let me tell you I promise you
[1:53:46] he's coming after you
[1:53:48] and he's coming after you with
[1:53:51] weapons I mean
[1:53:52] roll your pantyhose down
[1:53:55] come on now
[1:53:59] look at how bad it is
[1:54:02] that's that little sin that's when I
[1:54:05] Feel Complete
[1:54:07] sickening
[1:54:08] but he's coming after you
[1:54:11] and let me tell you you got to have your
[1:54:12] guard up all the time and music is the
[1:54:14] way
[1:54:16] that he can get in
[1:54:18] the um musicians
[1:54:21] can come brother Jonathan I'm going to
[1:54:22] have I'm going to have you close
[1:54:27] the music the musicians can come
[1:54:30] it says here
[1:54:34] Colossians 1 16 says all things were
[1:54:37] created by Him and for him
[1:54:39] so if we are gods if we are someone that
[1:54:44] that will give our life to God as Jesus
[1:54:47] instructed then we understand that that
[1:54:49] our whole lives are meant to serve Jesus
[1:54:52] and then don't forget let me let me let
[1:54:55] me do say this
[1:54:57] that it makes us happier
[1:54:59] it protects us
[1:55:01] everything is better when we do that
[1:55:04] I want to read
[1:55:07] well when when I was I was thinking
[1:55:10] about that and I was I was sitting back
[1:55:12] in my chair and I was looking at those
[1:55:14] lyrics to that ungodly song
[1:55:18] thought Lord that's a human being
[1:55:22] that wrote that
[1:55:25] and I was looking at it and and I I said
[1:55:29] I said Lord I said you could just one
[1:55:31] finger you could just wipe all this sin
[1:55:33] away and destroy all of that yet you let
[1:55:37] it go
[1:55:39] why
[1:55:44] I was just I was so I was so upset I was
[1:55:47] so hurt that this this song was out
[1:55:50] there and people singing it
[1:55:52] and then I thought of Isaiah that that
[1:55:55] the scripture I just referred to
[1:55:57] I thought about Isaiah
[1:56:00] and how
[1:56:02] Isaiah came before the Lord
[1:56:06] and he was as filthy as that songwriter
[1:56:10] as anyone else
[1:56:11] the prophet of God and he said Lord I've
[1:56:14] looked at you
[1:56:16] I'm gonna die because I'm a man of
[1:56:20] unclean lips
[1:56:21] and I was and I was sitting there I was
[1:56:23] looking at that song I was like Lord I'm
[1:56:24] The Sinner
[1:56:25] I I just Lord I'm I'm the one that's
[1:56:28] filthy and and I don't ever want to
[1:56:31] condemn this Lord have mercy on that
[1:56:34] person
[1:56:36] have mercy on all of these these people
[1:56:39] because this is a difficult time
[1:56:43] imagine Isaiah Millions 100 million
[1:56:46] angels
[1:56:48] around those Thrones around that throne
[1:56:51] and Jesus and he says I Am Lord I am a
[1:56:55] man
[1:56:55] of unclean lips
[1:56:57] [Music]
[1:57:00] I want to read one more scripture
[1:57:04] and it's something that
[1:57:07] think that
[1:57:10] [Music]
[1:57:11] how could it doesn't make sense how
[1:57:14] could how could this scripture be
[1:57:16] written
[1:57:18] with all of the sin in the world but
[1:57:20] Romans chapter 5 verse 8 the Apostle
[1:57:23] Paul speaking he says but God commendeth
[1:57:27] his love towards us
[1:57:30] in that while we were yet sinners
[1:57:36] Christ died for us
[1:57:38] so as much of a sinner as I am all that
[1:57:41] all that I've done wrong and maybe
[1:57:43] there's sin now yet while I lived in sin
[1:57:48] Christ died for me
[1:57:51] how much should we love it for that
[1:57:56] all the way we should give him
[1:57:58] everything
[1:58:00] give him
[1:58:01] give to God what is God's
[1:58:04] and give to Caesar what Caesar's
[1:58:08] God deserves it all
[1:58:11] all of it and you make mistakes
[1:58:14] we all do it doesn't matter
[1:58:16] come back from those mistakes
[1:58:19] but try like my commitment of losing
[1:58:22] weight
[1:58:23] it doesn't work until you stay with it
[1:58:27] amen
[1:58:30] Amma
[1:58:31] [Music]
[1:58:33] one of the first ways
[1:58:35] that we make that commitment
[1:58:38] is through baptism in the name of the
[1:58:39] Lord
[1:58:42] and if you haven't been baptized this
[1:58:43] morning would be a good time
[1:58:46] to be baptized it's it's a commitment
[1:58:48] that you make that is an outward
[1:58:49] expression of the Lord doing an inward
[1:58:52] work and then once you do that then you
[1:58:55] continue on following God and you have a
[1:58:59] promise after you're baptized
[1:59:02] and you young people hope I'm not too
[1:59:04] hard on the music
[1:59:06] I don't mean it to condemn in any way I
[1:59:09] just want to warn you
[1:59:11] careful with that
[1:59:13] it's a spirit that comes in and it's a
[1:59:15] way that the enemy tries to get in and
[1:59:17] hurt you
[1:59:18] do we have a baptism
[1:59:19] [Music]
[1:59:22] we do
[1:59:23] Brother Joseph are we good
[1:59:26] okay
[1:59:28] brother um brother Arnie if you could if
[1:59:31] you could take him back or
[1:59:35] [Music]
[1:59:36] anybody else
[1:59:40] brothers and sisters God bless you all
[1:59:44] when I talk about
[1:59:47] I really believe
[1:59:49] that the Lord Brother John I believe the
[1:59:50] Lord blessed us so much because our
[1:59:53] worship
[1:59:54] was acceptable to him
[1:59:57] and I want to continue on in improving
[1:59:59] with our worship and our music and put
[2:00:03] our lord Jesus first in all things give
[2:00:07] unto God the things that are God's God
[2:00:12] bless you all
[2:00:13] I'll uh I'll see you in a few minutes
[2:00:15] upstairs and I do feel what I'd like to
[2:00:19] do tonight
[2:00:20] is um
[2:00:23] there's a lot of folks missing from our
[2:00:26] congregation
[2:00:28] I would like to not
[2:00:30] necessarily cancel service
[2:00:33] but what I want to do is
[2:00:37] I want each of you
[2:00:40] if you be willing
[2:00:42] take at least 30 minutes
[2:00:45] this evening and give unto God
[2:00:48] those things that are God's take 30
[2:00:51] minutes and spend it in prayer this
[2:00:53] evening
[2:00:55] and we won't have service here we'll
[2:00:56] cancel service tonight
[2:00:58] but we make a commitment
[2:01:02] we make a commitment to go before the
[2:01:04] Lord in prayer
[2:01:06] we do it
[2:01:08] I think that it'll please him
[2:01:11] given to God the things that are God's
[2:01:16] God bless you all brother Jonathan
[2:01:18] [Music]
[2:01:24] maybe before uh
[2:01:27] the pastor moves out
[2:01:31] last Sunday
[2:01:32] [Music]
[2:01:34] as he was ministering here
[2:01:38] and
[2:01:40] saw the
[2:01:41] the laws
[2:01:43] the brothers and sisters that have left
[2:01:45] church that need our encouragement
[2:01:49] and then towards the servant at the end
[2:01:52] of the service
[2:01:53] [Music]
[2:01:54] he kind of say do you have
[2:01:59] someone in your heart
[2:02:03] and you want to pray
[2:02:06] for those people
[2:02:08] as I was seated there
[2:02:11] I had three people in my heart
[2:02:15] I come here
[2:02:17] [Music]
[2:02:19] I meet these two people
[2:02:22] that we are here
[2:02:25] and they are not here
[2:02:28] because situations
[2:02:31] happened in their lives
[2:02:33] I have met both of them
[2:02:37] man I have met both of them
[2:02:40] and when the Pastor said do you have
[2:02:44] people I raise my hands
[2:02:48] and I spoke the three names the two
[2:02:52] names
[2:02:54] then the third name
[2:02:57] is this sister seated here
[2:03:01] because this is the seated here
[2:03:04] she is
[2:03:06] the opposite house at the Castro house
[2:03:09] where I'm staying with brother
[2:03:11] Silas
[2:03:13] and she meets with brother n often
[2:03:17] when we are outside cleaning she walks
[2:03:20] in the yard
[2:03:21] so one day
[2:03:24] she walked to us there
[2:03:27] and she said
[2:03:29] can I have brother Ann's number
[2:03:32] so we start talking to her
[2:03:34] then she said she has been in this
[2:03:36] Tabernacle for 10 years
[2:03:39] she used to be here at this Tabernacle
[2:03:42] for 10 years
[2:03:43] with a certain family
[2:03:45] and that family they are not here they
[2:03:48] have gone somewhere
[2:03:50] so last Sunday I had this sister in my
[2:03:54] heart and those two men
[2:03:58] and immediately after service I usually
[2:04:01] remain here for some time just for
[2:04:03] prayer but that Sunday after the first
[2:04:06] service
[2:04:07] I just quickly walked
[2:04:10] and I went to knock at the sister's
[2:04:13] house
[2:04:14] and I said
[2:04:16] the Lord has spoken to my heart
[2:04:20] to come and talk to you that you need to
[2:04:23] go back to church
[2:04:29] and then
[2:04:31] she says brother Jonathan
[2:04:34] I am like this I am like this I said the
[2:04:37] Pastor
[2:04:39] said it's not what you are
[2:04:42] is what he is amen amen and what he has
[2:04:46] done to you he says look
[2:04:49] I used to wear this way I used to wear
[2:04:52] this way now I'm wearing this way I said
[2:04:55] go back to church
[2:04:58] so she made a commitment she says okay
[2:05:03] can I talk to brother Ann so she spoke
[2:05:05] to brother and
[2:05:07] she says she's coming Wednesday so
[2:05:10] Wednesday she was here and the pastor
[2:05:14] says can you continue coming
[2:05:16] so after I spoke to her I went in the
[2:05:19] room
[2:05:20] and I picked up this phone
[2:05:23] and I called that man
[2:05:26] [Music]
[2:05:27] that man the other man of these two I
[2:05:31] called a brother
[2:05:33] elderly brother
[2:05:35] I want to mention his name but you know
[2:05:37] him
[2:05:38] the father is here is listening to me
[2:05:42] and before I called him I was so much
[2:05:46] heartbroken and I was in tears I said
[2:05:49] Lord can I speak to him
[2:05:52] and I would feel like the Lord says
[2:05:54] speak to him so I called him
[2:05:57] I says how are you brother he says oh
[2:05:59] brother Jonathan how are you I said I'm
[2:06:02] fine
[2:06:03] I said are you private he said yes I'm
[2:06:06] private I said okay
[2:06:08] I feel that you can come
[2:06:11] maybe because I don't want to speak this
[2:06:15] thing on the phone you're an elder
[2:06:16] person
[2:06:18] so he says no no just go ahead brother
[2:06:20] Jonathan it's okay
[2:06:21] I said I'm from church
[2:06:24] the message today
[2:06:26] was that we reach out
[2:06:30] to our brothers our sisters who have not
[2:06:33] been here maybe we haven't encouraged
[2:06:36] them
[2:06:37] that they should come back to church
[2:06:40] I know that I have met your father and
[2:06:44] he has told me this this is what
[2:06:46] happened this is what happened in your
[2:06:48] life he said yes brother Jonathan this
[2:06:50] is what happened this is what happened
[2:06:51] is what happened
[2:06:52] I've been so heartbroken and things went
[2:06:56] this way and I'm this way
[2:06:58] but I want to tell you that I love the
[2:07:01] Lord
[2:07:01] [Music]
[2:07:04] I am okay right now
[2:07:07] just continue praying for me I said
[2:07:10] Thank you so I asked him to pray for me
[2:07:13] and when he started praying he broke
[2:07:15] down I broke down
[2:07:17] and I haven't spoken to the third person
[2:07:22] and the pasta in closing again he speaks
[2:07:25] those words
[2:07:26] so I just wanted to tell you that
[2:07:30] nothing
[2:07:33] brings the spirit of the Lord in the
[2:07:37] church
[2:07:38] than a sword that's right being said
[2:07:43] there is no joy
[2:07:46] that can ever be in the ministry
[2:07:49] in a local assembly that need to see a
[2:07:53] sinner
[2:07:55] we can sing good songs we can be a big
[2:07:58] church we can be everything
[2:08:00] but when I saw
[2:08:03] comes to the Lord then the scripture
[2:08:06] says there is so much joy
[2:08:10] in heaven the joy of the Lord is to see
[2:08:14] people coming from they are weaknesses
[2:08:17] there there are problems and they are
[2:08:20] coming to his home
[2:08:22] let's bow our heads and pray
[2:08:26] oh
[2:08:29] two Gods unchanging us oh
