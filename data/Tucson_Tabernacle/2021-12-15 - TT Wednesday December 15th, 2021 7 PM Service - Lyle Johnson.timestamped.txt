[42:32] for you
[42:37] with arms wide open
[42:42] [Music]
[42:55] what god can do
[42:58] [Music]
[43:01] there truly is no circuit what god can
[43:03] do
[43:04] it's beyond what we're able to
[43:06] comprehend but that doesn't make it a
[43:07] secret
[43:09] it's so good to be here tonight with you
[43:12] thank you for coming and those that are
[43:13] joining us virtually thank you
[43:16] i'm wondering to to start if we could
[43:18] sing together and i need your help
[43:21] and i need to turn this on the chorus of
[43:24] i pledge allegiance to the lamb
[43:28] see if i've got the words up here
[43:34] there it is
[43:37] i
[43:38] pledge allegiance
[43:41] to
[43:42] the lamb
[43:44] with all my strength
[43:48] with all i
[43:50] am i will seek
[43:53] to
[43:54] honor
[43:56] his commands
[43:59] i
[44:00] pledge allegiance
[44:03] to
[44:04] the lamb
[44:07] is that your pledge tonight
[44:10] is it mine
[44:12] let's make it ours together one more
[44:13] time
[44:14] i
[44:16] pledge
[44:18] allegiance to
[44:20] the lamb
[44:22] with all my strength
[44:26] with all i
[44:28] am i will seek
[44:32] to honor
[44:34] his commands
[44:37] i
[44:38] pledge allegiance
[44:41] to
[44:45] the land
[44:48] thank you so much
[44:51] you know a pledge
[44:53] it's a vow
[44:54] you give your word to do something or to
[44:56] perform something
[44:58] in the church denominations in my
[45:00] background every year they'd have a what
[45:01] they called a pledge drive and that
[45:03] meant that they were looking for money
[45:05] and they wanted you to commit to giving
[45:07] a certain amount every week or every
[45:09] month and then they'd give you envelopes
[45:11] with that amount on it to help remind
[45:13] you what your pledge was
[45:16] that was in the days before personal
[45:17] computers or
[45:19] smartphones and other conveniences that
[45:22] plague us today
[45:24] allegiance means to stand by something
[45:28] typically a cause
[45:30] or a nation
[45:31] you identify with it
[45:33] so to pledge allegiance to the lamb
[45:36] is to say that we give our word
[45:38] to stand by the cause of christ
[45:42] as we hold that thought expressed in
[45:43] that song please let's join our hearts
[45:45] together in prayer
[45:48] lord jesus it's a great honor it's a
[45:50] great privilege to stand here with your
[45:52] people tonight lord in this and this
[45:54] holy place that's been set aside lord
[45:57] lord jesus i pray that tonight that you
[46:00] would just take lyle johnson and
[46:02] push him out of the way lord we've all
[46:05] come each of us has come to hear from
[46:07] you lord something in our heart that
[46:09] we're looking for an answer some some
[46:12] something that we need from you tonight
[46:14] lord please provide it lord in spite of
[46:16] myself
[46:18] lord we commit this time unto you and we
[46:21] thank you we thank you for being with us
[46:23] we thank you for your promise we thank
[46:25] you for your word and lord we truly do
[46:28] pledge allegiance to you and we thank
[46:30] you in jesus precious name
[46:32] amen
[46:35] while we're standing
[46:37] let's read from the book of job
[46:40] it'll be from the 13th chapter and
[46:43] starting at verse 15.
[46:47] job's in the midst of a great trouble
[46:50] his friends are concerned for him
[46:51] they've traveled a long way to come and
[46:53] be with him but they're certain that the
[46:56] problems that job is facing
[46:59] is due to some secret sin in his life
[47:01] some unconfessed things something that
[47:03] he just won't admit
[47:04] but if he'll only confess it
[47:07] all will be well
[47:09] but job
[47:11] knows the integrity of his own heart
[47:13] he's confident that he hasn't
[47:15] transgressed him and that his heart is
[47:17] pure before god
[47:19] he refuses
[47:20] to confess falsely
[47:23] still
[47:25] he's bewildered
[47:26] by his misfortune
[47:29] and we read though he though god slay me
[47:32] yet will i trust in him i i don't
[47:35] understand all this evil that's befallen
[47:38] me i don't understand
[47:40] why god hasn't protected me
[47:43] but he's greater than i am
[47:45] his ways are higher than my ways my god
[47:47] is real and i will always trust him
[47:51] regardless
[47:52] of my circumstances
[47:55] but i will maintain my own ways before
[47:57] him i've lived a righteous life
[48:00] in obedience to his commands and i will
[48:02] continue
[48:03] to do so
[48:05] he also shall be my salvation job is
[48:08] looking at life's end here he says in
[48:11] another place naked came i into the
[48:13] world naked will i return
[48:15] the lord gave the lord's taken away
[48:18] blessed be the name of the lord
[48:21] he's holding fast
[48:23] in the face of unbearable loss
[48:26] anguish of soul
[48:28] he continues for an hypocrite shall not
[48:31] come before him
[48:33] again lord i've lived a righteous life i
[48:36] will continue to do so
[48:37] i won't confess to sins i've not
[48:39] committed
[48:41] i will continue to offer sacrifices to
[48:43] cover those that i have
[48:45] i will maintain the integrity of my
[48:47] heart
[48:48] life it's not about convenient and ease
[48:51] lord it's about integrity and it's about
[48:54] faith
[48:57] and and before we're seated a verse from
[48:59] hebrews 11
[49:01] the faith chapter we'll just read verse
[49:02] 6.
[49:04] paul's been talking about things he says
[49:06] but he says however
[49:08] without faith outside of faith apart
[49:11] from faith
[49:12] trust
[49:13] reliance
[49:15] assurance
[49:16] persuasion
[49:18] moral conviction
[49:20] it's impossible to please god
[49:22] unable to do it
[49:25] because he that cometh that's anyone
[49:28] that's you that's me
[49:31] he that cometh to god approaches god
[49:34] come nears to god
[49:36] must
[49:38] that's absolutely necessary
[49:41] must believe
[49:43] commit
[49:44] trust
[49:46] have faith that he is
[49:48] not just that he exists in history but
[49:51] he's alive
[49:53] he's living
[49:54] and
[49:55] and
[49:56] conjunction there's a second condition
[49:59] that god is a rewarder
[50:02] a remunerator
[50:04] of them
[50:05] us
[50:06] if we diligently seek him earnestly
[50:09] investigate
[50:11] search out
[50:12] and worship him worship god
[50:16] please be seated
[50:20] here we are it's another wednesday
[50:22] evening
[50:23] we can be together
[50:25] around the word of the lord
[50:27] to celebrate him
[50:29] to worship him
[50:31] to raise our voices and praise to him
[50:34] and to deepen our relationship with him
[50:38] and with each other
[50:42] yet
[50:43] we find ourselves under attack
[50:46] not so much from our fellow man or being
[50:49] singled out for persecution by our
[50:51] government
[50:52] not overtly at least not here in america
[50:55] but by stealth
[50:58] we see our ranks thinning
[51:00] through attrition
[51:02] disease
[51:03] death
[51:04] many of our youth are lost in a cyber
[51:06] world of fantasy and fiction
[51:09] teased away by attractions of the world
[51:12] about them
[51:13] enticed by their peers down a path that
[51:16] leads to darkness
[51:18] despair
[51:20] substituting christmas for christ
[51:23] exchanging gifts that perish rather than
[51:26] accepting the only gift that really
[51:28] matters
[51:30] we see addictions on the rise much worse
[51:32] than any virus
[51:34] not just of chemical substances
[51:37] but a true pandemic of epic proportions
[51:39] not a physical disease though covet is
[51:41] certainly taking a terrible toll
[51:44] but one that's much worse
[51:47] we're witnessing
[51:48] the destruction of our society and way
[51:52] of life tearing it down removing its
[51:53] very foundations
[51:55] and rebuilding it all
[51:57] and satan's image
[51:59] driven by a global network of computers
[52:02] and now being equipped with artificial
[52:04] intelligence that tracks and learns
[52:07] fed by social media
[52:09] whose algorithms seek to enslave
[52:12] individuals and divide society
[52:15] to feed people what they want to see and
[52:18] hear
[52:19] a time
[52:20] when truth is hidden
[52:23] when those who purport to inform you are
[52:25] really working to convince you that
[52:27] their words are truth that their
[52:29] perspective is the only correct one
[52:32] their interpretation is the only one
[52:34] that you should believe everything else
[52:35] is fake news
[52:38] a couple of months ago we shared with
[52:40] you about helen and holly
[52:43] i think a great destroyer is amongst us
[52:45] hiding under the name of video games or
[52:48] computer games
[52:49] most are graphically violent
[52:52] and we see the results played out in
[52:54] schools across our nations murderous
[52:56] rampages
[52:58] suicides
[52:59] acting out fantasies that result in
[53:01] mayhem
[53:02] and death
[53:04] just last week a second cousin of mine
[53:06] came through town and came to visit for
[53:08] evening just passing through she had her
[53:10] oldest son with her a quiet polite young
[53:14] man of 17 or so but i noticed his left
[53:17] arm
[53:18] was covered with scars
[53:20] where he'd been cutting himself
[53:23] his hair was dyed black
[53:25] his fingernails were polished black
[53:29] he didn't often make eye contact he said
[53:31] i can tell you a lot about your shoes
[53:34] he was always looking down
[53:36] he was at a complete loss about what he
[53:37] might want to do after high school he
[53:39] says his main activity is playing video
[53:42] games
[53:45] another young person came to our house
[53:47] recently and on the back of her laptop
[53:49] computer all sorts of stickers
[53:51] one of which was
[53:52] a demonic horrible thing being crucified
[53:59] demons run rampant
[54:01] mocking us
[54:03] daring us
[54:05] dominating our society and infiltrating
[54:07] everywhere this isn't black and white tv
[54:10] in the age of i love lucy that brother
[54:12] branham warned us about
[54:14] no
[54:15] with covid
[54:16] school classes world often are still
[54:18] required to be online using zoom
[54:21] or similar technology isolating our
[54:24] youth from social contact in the
[54:26] physical world and substituting this
[54:28] virtual world this virtual reality this
[54:32] madeverse as the founders of
[54:35] facebook are calling it you're almost
[54:37] required to have an email account these
[54:40] days
[54:41] do your banking pay your bills on your
[54:43] computer or your smartphone
[54:45] cash is beyond being replaced by cash
[54:47] and debit cards it's use apple pay or
[54:49] google pay
[54:51] i'm sorry i didn't mean to go on a
[54:52] rampage about this
[54:55] but i can hear someone screaming johnny
[54:57] get out of the street
[54:59] a car's coming
[55:01] what i really
[55:03] wanted to bring you tonight
[55:05] was encouragement
[55:07] in the face of this onslaught of evil in
[55:10] our world
[55:12] it often takes the form of an extended
[55:14] illness
[55:15] or death of a loved one a family member
[55:18] sometimes of a child
[55:21] the result that i see all too often is
[55:24] discouragement
[55:25] an attitude of just giving up
[55:30] in our extended family
[55:32] more than 30 years ago a nephew was
[55:34] killed in a tragic airplane accident
[55:38] his dad was a solid christian
[55:40] a deacon in his church
[55:43] a well-respected family
[55:45] he struggled for years with why did this
[55:48] happen
[55:49] i was doing everything right
[55:52] where was god when my son needed him the
[55:55] most
[55:58] job faced the same question
[56:00] why do the righteous suffer
[56:04] well let's read just a bit more from
[56:06] hebrews 11 we'll we'll skip down to
[56:08] verse 32.
[56:11] what more shall i say
[56:14] paul has been talking about heroes of
[56:16] faith for the time would fail me to tell
[56:18] of gideon or of barrack or of samson or
[56:22] viaphet of david also and samuel and of
[56:26] the prophets
[56:28] who through faith subdued kingdoms
[56:32] wrought righteousness
[56:34] obtained promises
[56:36] stopped the mouths of lions quenched the
[56:38] violence of fire escape the edge of the
[56:40] sword
[56:42] out of weakness we're made strong
[56:46] waxed valiant in fight
[56:48] turned to flight the armies of the
[56:50] aliens women receive their dead raised
[56:52] to life again
[56:55] when we think of faith
[56:57] we often think of these victories as
[56:59] paul outlines here
[57:01] he's just written about the faith of
[57:03] abraham and sarah yes he eulogizes
[57:07] sarah's faith also she didn't only laugh
[57:09] you know
[57:10] paul speaks of joseph
[57:13] and moses
[57:14] and others
[57:16] he concludes that portion of the chapter
[57:19] that we just read a summary of important
[57:21] and seemingly impossible feats and
[57:24] victories
[57:25] the testimonies we all like to hear
[57:28] and love to share
[57:30] david versus goliath the weak versus the
[57:33] strong
[57:34] brother brannan preached a message
[57:36] called perfect strength and perfect
[57:37] weakness
[57:39] admonishing us not to depend on our own
[57:41] abilities but to surrender ourselves to
[57:43] god
[57:44] follow his guidance his direction
[57:48] get out of our comfort zone we might say
[57:50] today
[57:52] but hebrews 11
[57:54] we call it the faith chapter but but it
[57:56] doesn't stop here
[57:58] let's read just a little bit more
[58:01] others
[58:02] were tortured
[58:04] not accepting deliverance that they
[58:06] might obtain a better resurrection
[58:08] others had trial
[58:10] of cruel mockings scourgings
[58:14] yay of bonds
[58:16] imprisonment they were stoned
[58:20] they were sawn asunder
[58:23] were tempted were slain with the sword
[58:26] they wandered about in sheepskins
[58:30] goatskins
[58:32] being destitute
[58:34] afflicted
[58:36] tormented
[58:38] paul tells us
[58:40] and the world was not worthy
[58:42] of these warriors of faith
[58:46] they wandered in deserts
[58:48] on mountains
[58:49] and dens
[58:51] and caves of the earth
[58:53] these aren't the victorious testimonies
[58:55] we seek to hear very often
[58:57] and paul wasn't just talking about the
[58:59] past
[59:02] he says these all having obtained a good
[59:05] report
[59:07] through faith
[59:09] received not the promise they didn't
[59:12] experience the fulfillment of the
[59:15] promise god having provided some better
[59:17] thing for us that they without us should
[59:20] not be made perfect
[59:23] a good report
[59:25] yeah
[59:26] we can't read it at least not yet but
[59:28] the reports are filed in god's record
[59:30] book and that's the record that counts
[59:35] that's where by grace through faith
[59:38] our good reports will be found
[59:41] and that better thing paul's talking
[59:43] about us is not
[59:45] freedom from suffering or persecution
[59:48] or sickness
[59:50] or death
[59:51] in first corinthians chapter 10 verse 12
[59:54] we read
[59:55] wherefore let him that thinketh he
[59:57] standeth take heed lest he fall
[1:00:00] watch out for that spiritual pride there
[1:00:03] hath no temptation
[1:00:05] taken you
[1:00:06] but such is common to man
[1:00:10] your troubles may not be as unique as
[1:00:12] you think they are but god is faithful
[1:00:16] who will not suffer you to be tempted
[1:00:18] above that you're able
[1:00:20] but will with the temptation also make a
[1:00:23] way to escape
[1:00:25] that you may be able to bear it
[1:00:29] escape doesn't necessarily mean being
[1:00:31] freed
[1:00:33] escape may be strength
[1:00:36] it doesn't guarantee healing if you're
[1:00:38] sick
[1:00:39] it means god will provide you with the
[1:00:41] strength his strength is revealed
[1:00:43] through our weakness
[1:00:45] he'll provide you the strength to endure
[1:00:48] it
[1:00:49] we'll see an example of this in a moment
[1:00:53] corinthians goes on wherefore my dearly
[1:00:55] beloved flee from idolatry don't worship
[1:00:58] anything else
[1:01:00] worship the lord trust in the lord i
[1:01:02] speak as to wise men
[1:01:04] you judge what i say
[1:01:08] in his
[1:01:09] second letter to timothy
[1:01:12] in two places he talks a little bit
[1:01:15] about this sort of thing he says
[1:01:16] therefore
[1:01:18] this is paul talking i endure
[1:01:21] all things for the elect's sake that
[1:01:24] they may also obtain the salvation which
[1:01:27] is in christ jesus
[1:01:28] with eternal glory
[1:01:31] it's a faithful saying
[1:01:33] for if we be dead with him
[1:01:36] we must die to ourselves
[1:01:38] so that we shall also live with him
[1:01:42] if we suffer
[1:01:43] we shall also reign with him
[1:01:47] do you want to reign with him
[1:01:49] expect suffering in your life don't seek
[1:01:51] it
[1:01:52] but expect it
[1:01:54] if we deny him
[1:01:56] he will also deny us
[1:01:59] if we believe not yet he abides faithful
[1:02:03] he can't deny himself
[1:02:06] another part second timothy chapter 3
[1:02:08] verse 10 he says but thou
[1:02:11] remember in the in the king james thou
[1:02:13] is the personal version of the second
[1:02:15] person of you so he's not talking to a
[1:02:17] church he's talking to an individual he
[1:02:19] says but timothy
[1:02:21] you've fully known my doctrine
[1:02:24] my manner of life
[1:02:26] my purpose
[1:02:28] my faith
[1:02:30] long suffering
[1:02:32] charity love patience
[1:02:35] persecutions
[1:02:37] afflictions
[1:02:38] which came unto me at antioch at iconium
[1:02:41] at lystra
[1:02:43] what persecutions i endured
[1:02:45] but out of them all
[1:02:47] the lord delivered me
[1:02:50] paul's not alone
[1:02:52] here comes a promise we don't often seek
[1:02:54] or embrace or even talk about but the
[1:02:56] next verse tells us
[1:02:59] yeah
[1:03:01] rest assured all that will live godly in
[1:03:04] christ jesus
[1:03:06] shall
[1:03:07] suffer
[1:03:08] persecution
[1:03:10] evil men and seducers
[1:03:12] we just talked about
[1:03:13] some of that
[1:03:15] shall wax worse and worse deceiving
[1:03:18] and being deceived
[1:03:20] we often think of persecution as as
[1:03:22] physical oppression through our fellow
[1:03:24] man or perhaps through some sort of
[1:03:26] government policy
[1:03:28] think
[1:03:29] hate crimes
[1:03:31] when i was a kid i never heard of
[1:03:33] anything like a hate crime what's this
[1:03:35] but
[1:03:36] now that's a federal felony
[1:03:39] now certainly paul is using these
[1:03:41] examples of physical
[1:03:42] persecutions and so forth as he
[1:03:44] instructs timothy and what will turn out
[1:03:47] to be the last letter of his that we
[1:03:49] have
[1:03:51] but who is our adversary
[1:03:54] where does our persecution
[1:03:56] ultimately come from
[1:03:59] and who's eden are we dwelling
[1:04:02] satan's
[1:04:04] so the persecution in whatever form
[1:04:07] comes from him
[1:04:09] it's spiritual warfare
[1:04:11] not physical our weapons and armor are
[1:04:14] foolish to the natural man a skeptic
[1:04:16] would say
[1:04:18] prayer
[1:04:19] you mean talking to yourself
[1:04:21] there's no god stupid the bible fables
[1:04:26] tales moral teachings and full of
[1:04:29] violence and all sorts of terrible
[1:04:30] things how can you put any faith in
[1:04:32] jewish myths
[1:04:34] why would you
[1:04:36] if you want peace try yoga
[1:04:39] yet
[1:04:40] yielded with faith
[1:04:42] our weapons and defenses are effective
[1:04:46] to the pulling down
[1:04:48] of satan's strongholds
[1:04:50] and he knows it
[1:04:52] paul writing to the church at corinth
[1:04:55] once more aren't you glad
[1:04:57] that the corinthians had so many
[1:04:59] problems
[1:05:00] i thank god for the problems the
[1:05:02] corinthians had because if they didn't
[1:05:04] have those problems we wouldn't have
[1:05:05] paul's letters
[1:05:08] i'm sure satan was gloating back then
[1:05:10] out of what i've done to these guys
[1:05:13] trying to discredit and stamp out the
[1:05:15] early church and it all backfired and
[1:05:17] these letters still served to inspire us
[1:05:20] tens of centuries later
[1:05:24] ii corinthians 10 verse 3
[1:05:27] for though we walk in the flesh
[1:05:30] while we live in these earthly bodies
[1:05:33] we do not war after the flesh
[1:05:36] ours is a spiritual battle
[1:05:39] on another field another plane of
[1:05:41] existence
[1:05:43] for the weapons of our warfare
[1:05:45] aren't carnal
[1:05:47] but they are mighty through god to the
[1:05:50] pulling down of strongholds
[1:05:53] what do they do what do we do casting
[1:05:55] down imaginations
[1:05:58] virtual reality and every high thing
[1:06:00] that exalteth itself
[1:06:03] against the knowledge of god
[1:06:06] and bringeth into captivity every
[1:06:08] thought
[1:06:09] to the obedience
[1:06:11] of christ
[1:06:12] i pledge allegiance to the lamb that
[1:06:15] battlefield that's of and in our minds
[1:06:19] and having in readiness to revenge all
[1:06:21] disobedience when your obedience is
[1:06:23] fulfilled verse 5
[1:06:25] it speaks to the battle in our minds
[1:06:28] our mental struggles
[1:06:30] that fight our spirits
[1:06:32] that sow seeds of doubt
[1:06:35] bringing into captivity every thought
[1:06:39] to the obedience of christ
[1:06:42] but none of this necessarily means
[1:06:44] physical deliverance
[1:06:46] will be in this battle
[1:06:48] until we draw our final breath
[1:06:52] listen again to paul
[1:06:53] as he defends his calling in ministry
[1:06:55] against those who were rising up to
[1:06:57] oppose him and second corinthians 10
[1:07:00] just a few verses down starting at uh at
[1:07:02] verse 10.
[1:07:05] paul is uh is talking about what some of
[1:07:07] his detractors are saying for his
[1:07:09] letters say they are weighty and
[1:07:12] powerful yeah peter said
[1:07:15] some things paul writes hard to be
[1:07:17] understood
[1:07:18] but his bodily presence is weak
[1:07:21] and paul's speech
[1:07:23] contemptible
[1:07:27] the next chapter
[1:07:28] paul
[1:07:29] seems to admit this a little bit he says
[1:07:31] but though i be rude in speech
[1:07:34] my kentucky english
[1:07:36] yet not in knowledge
[1:07:39] we've been thoroughly made manifest
[1:07:40] among you in all things is that how you
[1:07:42] imagine paul
[1:07:44] persuading the greeks i i tend to think
[1:07:47] of him as a superbly educated highly
[1:07:50] trained eloquent
[1:07:53] yet we're told god took him to the back
[1:07:55] side of the desert to arabia
[1:07:57] to reveal himself to him
[1:07:59] and here paul says
[1:08:02] i'm weak and inarticulate when i speak
[1:08:05] but i can write pretty well but i'm not
[1:08:08] such a good speaker
[1:08:10] recall that when moses complained of his
[1:08:12] inability to speak to the group he was
[1:08:14] destined to lead god let aaron be moses
[1:08:17] mouthpiece
[1:08:19] paul had to speak in spite of his
[1:08:20] difficulties he wasn't given an errand
[1:08:23] to help him out
[1:08:26] was the suffering that paul wrote about
[1:08:28] in hebrews 11
[1:08:31] for the past
[1:08:33] for those before his time
[1:08:35] those heroes of faith let's let's take a
[1:08:39] look
[1:08:40] as he relates
[1:08:42] some of his own experiences
[1:08:45] again second corinthians 11 jumping down
[1:08:47] to verse 24
[1:08:49] of the jews he said five times
[1:08:53] i was whipped with 39 lashes
[1:08:58] in those days if you were arrested and
[1:09:00] questioned or interrogated the euphemism
[1:09:03] is examined
[1:09:05] it meant a beating
[1:09:06] it meant torture
[1:09:09] three times
[1:09:11] i was beaten with rods
[1:09:14] once
[1:09:15] i was stoned
[1:09:18] the intent of stoning is to kill
[1:09:21] we're told in acts 14 19 this happened
[1:09:23] at leicester on his very first
[1:09:25] missionary journey
[1:09:27] sharing the gospel of peace and
[1:09:29] redemption
[1:09:30] and met with such violence
[1:09:34] i can hear paul lord
[1:09:36] are you really sure this is what you
[1:09:38] want me to do
[1:09:40] he was human
[1:09:42] he said three times
[1:09:44] i suffered shipwreck
[1:09:47] not like they had lifeboats in those
[1:09:48] days or life preservers a night and a
[1:09:51] day have i been in the deep
[1:09:54] cold
[1:09:55] no wetsuit or snorkel goggles or masks
[1:09:59] no doubt on the verge of hypothermia
[1:10:01] probably naked as well to get rid of the
[1:10:02] weight of his clothing that would
[1:10:04] otherwise drag him down and cause him to
[1:10:06] drown
[1:10:09] in journeyings often
[1:10:12] and perils of water
[1:10:14] fording rivers tiny boats
[1:10:17] and perils dangers of robbers
[1:10:21] in spite of the roman peace pox romana
[1:10:24] travelers were often way late no one
[1:10:26] seemed surprised when jesus spoke of a
[1:10:28] traveler between jerusalem and jericho
[1:10:31] being attacked robbed and left for dead
[1:10:33] by the side of the road
[1:10:36] the passers-by just
[1:10:38] passed by
[1:10:40] not so different from our day where
[1:10:42] people stand by while someone's attacked
[1:10:44] or
[1:10:45] take a video of it for their social
[1:10:47] media followers
[1:10:49] considering the punishment for robbery
[1:10:51] in those days was crucifixion
[1:10:54] right the other two people
[1:10:55] that were with jesus on calvary were
[1:10:58] thieves they were robbers
[1:11:00] so the offenders were often violent
[1:11:03] we're not talking about purse snatches
[1:11:04] or pickpockets or shoplifters here
[1:11:08] in perils
[1:11:09] by mine own countrymen
[1:11:12] as he just mentioned they're the ones
[1:11:13] that lashed him stoned him
[1:11:16] in perils by the heathen
[1:11:18] remember the uproar in ephesus
[1:11:21] or the beating and imprisonment at
[1:11:23] philippi
[1:11:25] those were the very ones god sent him to
[1:11:27] reach
[1:11:28] in perils and city
[1:11:30] and perils in the wilderness
[1:11:33] and perils danger in the sea
[1:11:36] and perils
[1:11:37] danger
[1:11:39] from false brethren
[1:11:41] i think these had to be the worst
[1:11:44] violently opposed by those who claimed
[1:11:46] to be part of the same body and work as
[1:11:48] he was
[1:11:50] not so different than
[1:11:52] judas in weariness
[1:11:55] and painfulness
[1:11:57] sadness
[1:11:59] travail
[1:12:00] and watchings often
[1:12:02] sleepless nights
[1:12:04] and hunger
[1:12:05] and thirst
[1:12:07] he wasn't being put up in a nice hotel
[1:12:09] by the local church and going out to
[1:12:11] nice meals at a restaurant
[1:12:13] and fastings often
[1:12:15] that's going hungry this isn't a
[1:12:17] reference to voluntary fasting and
[1:12:19] process of seeking the lord paul missed
[1:12:22] a lot of meals
[1:12:24] cold
[1:12:26] nakedness insufficient clothing
[1:12:27] shivering in the cold
[1:12:31] beside
[1:12:32] those things that are without in
[1:12:34] addition to all this
[1:12:36] that which comes upon me daily
[1:12:39] because of my burden the care of all the
[1:12:42] churches
[1:12:44] he illustrates who's weak and i'm not
[1:12:46] weak
[1:12:47] when i hear of someone's weakness i feel
[1:12:50] their weakness i share that weakness
[1:12:52] who's offended and i burn not who's led
[1:12:55] astray and i don't burn with anger and
[1:12:57] sorrow and indignation for them
[1:13:02] if i must needs glory if i have to boast
[1:13:04] or brag to get your attention you
[1:13:06] corinthians he's saying i will boast of
[1:13:09] the things which concern
[1:13:11] my infirmities
[1:13:13] those things which render me weak and
[1:13:15] contemptible
[1:13:17] in the eyes of my opponents
[1:13:20] the god and father of our lord jesus
[1:13:22] christ which is blessed forever knows
[1:13:24] that
[1:13:25] i'm didn't tell you the pack of lies
[1:13:26] here
[1:13:27] that's true
[1:13:28] i'm speaking truthfully and speaking
[1:13:30] plainly he gives one last example here
[1:13:33] he says when i was in damascus
[1:13:35] a pretty big city the governor under
[1:13:38] orechus the king kept the city of
[1:13:40] damascus with a garrison
[1:13:43] a garrison of soldiers trying to
[1:13:45] apprehend me
[1:13:47] and through a window in a basket i was
[1:13:50] let down by the wall and escaped his
[1:13:52] hands
[1:13:54] in other words he was helped by some
[1:13:56] locals willing to put themselves in
[1:13:58] danger on paul's behalf
[1:14:01] in defense of the gospel
[1:14:04] is that how you see paul in your mind
[1:14:07] when you read his epistles
[1:14:10] i think it should be clear to us that
[1:14:12] living as christians is not a call to a
[1:14:14] party
[1:14:16] but to be a party of the cult
[1:14:19] we have a target painted on our backs
[1:14:21] that satan sees
[1:14:23] and he marks us for destruction
[1:14:26] destruction often by means so subtle
[1:14:29] we may not even recognize the attack or
[1:14:31] discern the intent
[1:14:33] until we're caught in the trap his web
[1:14:35] of deceit
[1:14:36] battling in our minds our bodies are
[1:14:38] both his wrath
[1:14:40] directed at us
[1:14:43] it wasn't just people in bible times
[1:14:46] it wasn't just the early church
[1:14:48] satan doesn't give up
[1:14:50] he wants to take with him all that he
[1:14:53] can
[1:14:54] we must be watchful
[1:14:56] and watching out for each other
[1:15:00] well
[1:15:01] getting back to paul and the same letter
[1:15:04] he addresses healing
[1:15:07] i don't think anyone can doubt paul's
[1:15:09] faith
[1:15:11] or the faith of the people offering
[1:15:13] prayers on paul's behalf
[1:15:15] yet we read again in second corinthians
[1:15:18] 12 and verse 7.
[1:15:21] unless i should be exalted in order to
[1:15:23] prevent that i be exalted above measure
[1:15:25] through the abundance of the revelation
[1:15:28] dealing with the equivalent of the deity
[1:15:30] spirit in his day
[1:15:32] those who wanted to worship paul
[1:15:34] substitute the messenger for the message
[1:15:36] the apostle for the savior
[1:15:39] that was given to me this was a gift
[1:15:42] it was given to me
[1:15:44] a thorn
[1:15:46] in the flesh
[1:15:48] if you've ever had a thorn
[1:15:50] it can be relentless
[1:15:52] think of uh think of a choya
[1:15:55] pain
[1:15:56] infection
[1:15:57] doesn't go away
[1:16:00] and this thorn in the flesh that was
[1:16:02] given to him was a messenger of satan
[1:16:06] that's always the source
[1:16:09] god may give him leave to attack but
[1:16:11] it's not god who attacks
[1:16:14] and it's not your brother or sister that
[1:16:16] attacks either
[1:16:19] this messenger sigma sent to buffett me
[1:16:21] to buff it
[1:16:22] that's repeated blows some are hard
[1:16:25] some may not be
[1:16:28] may go for a while
[1:16:30] and then get hit again
[1:16:34] distracting and annoying at best
[1:16:36] painful and crippling at worst
[1:16:40] paul says to prevent that i should be
[1:16:41] exalted above measure
[1:16:44] of paul
[1:16:46] he preaches divine healing tells a good
[1:16:48] story
[1:16:49] where's his faith he has his physical
[1:16:51] problems that just don't get better
[1:16:53] don't pay any attention to him he's
[1:16:55] probably a secret sinner
[1:16:58] remind you a little bit of job
[1:17:01] for this thing for this thorn
[1:17:03] for this messenger this gift that
[1:17:06] buffets me i besought the lord three
[1:17:08] different times
[1:17:10] that it might depart from me
[1:17:13] lord
[1:17:14] this impediment is causing people to
[1:17:16] turn from you they won't listen to me
[1:17:19] it's providing ammunit well arrows in
[1:17:22] those days arrows for satan's archers to
[1:17:25] attack the word i'm bringing
[1:17:27] please lord it's a trivial thing for you
[1:17:29] to take this from me
[1:17:32] and maybe sometime later when that
[1:17:34] prayer didn't seem to be answered
[1:17:36] lord
[1:17:37] i heard that jesus told the story the
[1:17:39] persistent petitioner and the unjust
[1:17:41] judge who grew worried of her and
[1:17:42] granted her petition i'm coming back
[1:17:45] i'm asking humbly for your healing touch
[1:17:48] on my weak and sickly body
[1:17:51] three times paul said
[1:17:53] and then he got his answer
[1:17:56] he said to me
[1:17:58] he said to me paul
[1:18:00] paul
[1:18:02] my grace
[1:18:03] my love and kindness
[1:18:06] my mercy is sufficient for you
[1:18:09] my strength is made perfect
[1:18:12] it's fulfilled it's completed it's made
[1:18:15] manifest it's on display in your
[1:18:17] weakness
[1:18:19] wow
[1:18:21] i'm not gonna grant your request paul
[1:18:23] because i have a purpose in allowing
[1:18:25] this
[1:18:27] trust me paul
[1:18:28] your weakness
[1:18:30] reveals my strength
[1:18:34] most gladly therefore will i rather
[1:18:36] glory in my infirmities that the power
[1:18:38] of christ may rest upon me may dwell in
[1:18:42] me
[1:18:43] may work through me he may pitch his
[1:18:45] tabernacle his tent over me
[1:18:49] therefore
[1:18:51] hard as it is i take pleasure in my
[1:18:54] infirmities and my weaknesses
[1:18:57] and reproaches
[1:18:59] insults
[1:19:00] and necessities
[1:19:02] hardships
[1:19:04] and persecutions
[1:19:06] and distresses
[1:19:07] troubles
[1:19:09] for christ's sake for when i am weak
[1:19:12] not depending on myself and my abilities
[1:19:14] and reason then i am strong
[1:19:17] through christ
[1:19:19] by faith
[1:19:21] so we see
[1:19:22] paul
[1:19:24] the apostle to the gentiles the
[1:19:26] messenger the one through whom god
[1:19:27] established the gentile church
[1:19:30] the one we look upon as being the
[1:19:31] messenger to the first church age one of
[1:19:33] the stars
[1:19:35] and the hand of jesus
[1:19:39] and we see him as weak
[1:19:41] and infirm in the flesh
[1:19:45] yet so very mighty in the lord
[1:19:47] and that strength in the lord is
[1:19:49] revealed through
[1:19:50] the weakness of his flesh
[1:19:54] one who preached healing
[1:19:56] deliverance
[1:19:58] it was sickly and vexed
[1:20:04] moving through time
[1:20:06] to the life and ministry of brother
[1:20:07] branham we often hear him say that our
[1:20:10] attitude towards god's promises brings
[1:20:12] them to pass
[1:20:14] from early in his ministry this is from
[1:20:16] expectation in 1950
[1:20:18] he says we always get what we expect
[1:20:22] when people expect anything well they
[1:20:24] usually get what you look for it's the
[1:20:25] mental attitude that you have
[1:20:27] remember this and never forget it
[1:20:30] the right mental attitude towards any
[1:20:32] promise of god will bring it to pass
[1:20:35] the right mental attitude towards any
[1:20:37] promise of god
[1:20:39] it doesn't take gifts of healing to heal
[1:20:41] sick people any person in here has a
[1:20:43] right to meet satan anywhere if you're a
[1:20:46] christian and defeat him on any grounds
[1:20:48] that he could stand on
[1:20:51] and late in his ministry in 1963 show us
[1:20:54] the father he says and i go on record i
[1:20:57] say this about the word of god being a
[1:20:58] seed if you can take the right mental
[1:21:01] attitude towards any divine promise of
[1:21:03] god
[1:21:04] he'll bring it to pass
[1:21:06] if you can get yourself in position to
[1:21:08] believe that that promise was to you
[1:21:13] well you may ask well
[1:21:15] well what about that brother lyle
[1:21:17] doesn't that mean that god will always
[1:21:19] heal us if we approach him correctly
[1:21:22] if we pray and the person isn't healed
[1:21:24] doesn't it mean our faith is misplaced
[1:21:26] or weak
[1:21:28] paul wasn't healed paul's faith was not
[1:21:30] misplaced nor was it weak
[1:21:33] recall
[1:21:34] brother branham's baby girl lay sick
[1:21:37] and died
[1:21:39] suffering he relates us for example and
[1:21:41] show us the father and it'll satisfy us
[1:21:43] 1953 he says i stood there
[1:21:47] when my own baby
[1:21:49] about 14 years ago 15 my own little baby
[1:21:52] six months old
[1:21:54] i was praying for it and it died
[1:21:58] went out from under my arms
[1:22:00] and i was walking up the road i lost my
[1:22:02] father my brother
[1:22:04] my wife
[1:22:07] you know my story
[1:22:09] this was very hard
[1:22:11] i cannot imagine
[1:22:13] how hard this is
[1:22:16] yet he also told us in redemption and
[1:22:18] completeness in joy 1954 he says if i
[1:22:21] pray i prayed for 10 000 people tonight
[1:22:25] and they all died in the morning
[1:22:27] tomorrow night i'd be back here praying
[1:22:29] for the sick
[1:22:31] believing god's word was right
[1:22:34] that's right if i was dying
[1:22:36] and 5 000 people that had died 100 years
[1:22:39] ago
[1:22:39] been an eternity that long and rose back
[1:22:44] come to the earth and said brother
[1:22:45] branham don't you trust it
[1:22:47] don't trust it we trusted him went
[1:22:49] failed
[1:22:51] i'd still say
[1:22:53] let me die in jesus christ
[1:22:56] that's right
[1:22:57] i believe it and that's my whole heart
[1:22:59] everything is set right in that i
[1:23:00] believe it with my whole heart i depend
[1:23:03] on him
[1:23:07] so not getting our desired result does
[1:23:09] not diminish god's word
[1:23:12] god's promises
[1:23:14] or god's faithfulness
[1:23:16] we must keep our perspective
[1:23:18] he is in charge
[1:23:21] we're told in revelation that we're
[1:23:23] created to please him and for thy
[1:23:26] pleasure we are created
[1:23:28] he wasn't created to please us
[1:23:32] let's look at another example
[1:23:35] this one from king david
[1:23:38] nathan departed unto his house and the
[1:23:40] lord struck the child that uriah's wife
[1:23:43] barren to david and it was very sick now
[1:23:45] this is an innocent
[1:23:47] baby it's from a sinful act but it's an
[1:23:50] innocent baby the baby didn't
[1:23:52] participate the baby had nothing to do
[1:23:53] with it it's a baby
[1:23:55] it's a baby
[1:23:57] david therefore
[1:23:59] besought god for the child
[1:24:04] david fasted
[1:24:06] he went in he laid all night on the
[1:24:09] earth
[1:24:12] and the elders of his house arose and
[1:24:14] went to him to raise david get up
[1:24:17] come on
[1:24:20] no he would not
[1:24:23] he wouldn't even eat with them
[1:24:26] seven days it came to pass on the
[1:24:29] seventh day
[1:24:31] that the child died
[1:24:34] and the servants of david feared to tell
[1:24:36] them that the child was dead for they
[1:24:38] said
[1:24:38] behold
[1:24:40] while the child was yet alive and we
[1:24:42] spoke to him
[1:24:43] he wouldn't hearken to our voice
[1:24:46] how will he then fix himself if we tell
[1:24:48] him that the child is dead
[1:24:51] but when david saw that his servants
[1:24:53] whispered
[1:24:55] david
[1:24:56] perceived
[1:24:58] the baby had died
[1:25:01] therefore david said to his servants is
[1:25:03] the child dead
[1:25:05] and they said
[1:25:07] yeah
[1:25:08] yeah
[1:25:09] he's dead
[1:25:12] then david arose from the earth then
[1:25:15] david arose from the earth
[1:25:17] and washed
[1:25:19] and anointed himself
[1:25:22] and changed his apparel and came into
[1:25:24] the house of the lord
[1:25:26] and worshiped
[1:25:29] was he sad
[1:25:31] was he grieving
[1:25:33] of course
[1:25:36] yet he immediately worshipped the one
[1:25:38] who seemingly had not answered his
[1:25:41] prayers
[1:25:42] certainly not in the way that he had
[1:25:43] hoped
[1:25:46] then he came to his own house and when
[1:25:48] he required they set bread before him
[1:25:50] and he did eat then said his servants
[1:25:52] him
[1:25:53] what is this that you've done
[1:25:55] you fast and wept for the child while it
[1:25:58] was alive but the child's dead and you
[1:26:00] rise up and eat bread this is not our
[1:26:01] custom
[1:26:03] when someone dies we have we said chev
[1:26:05] of seven days we're in mourning what's
[1:26:07] going on david
[1:26:10] and he said
[1:26:11] while the child was yet alive
[1:26:13] i fasted and wept
[1:26:16] i sought the lord
[1:26:18] i said who can tell
[1:26:20] whether god will be gracious to me
[1:26:23] that the child may live
[1:26:26] but now he's dead
[1:26:28] why should i fast can i bring him back
[1:26:30] again
[1:26:32] someday i'll go to him but he's not
[1:26:34] going to return to me
[1:26:38] the key to all this
[1:26:40] is that our prayers
[1:26:42] with that correct mental attitude
[1:26:45] must be within
[1:26:47] the will of
[1:26:48] god remember jesus being tested at the
[1:26:52] start of his ministry
[1:26:54] cast yourself down make these stones
[1:26:56] into bread
[1:26:57] what about in gethsemane mark 14 verse
[1:27:00] 32 we read they came to a place which
[1:27:03] was named gethsemane
[1:27:05] and jesus said to his disciples
[1:27:08] sit here
[1:27:09] while i pray
[1:27:12] and you took with him peter and james
[1:27:13] and john
[1:27:15] and began to be sore amazed and very
[1:27:17] heavy
[1:27:18] he said to them
[1:27:20] my soul is exceedingly sorrowful unto
[1:27:23] death
[1:27:24] terry here
[1:27:26] watch
[1:27:29] and he went forward a little
[1:27:31] and fell on the ground
[1:27:34] kind of like david did so many years
[1:27:36] earlier
[1:27:37] and prayed that if it were possible the
[1:27:39] hour might pass from him
[1:27:43] this is the request
[1:27:45] of jesus
[1:27:46] to the father
[1:27:48] this
[1:27:49] is jesus
[1:27:52] desire
[1:27:54] and he said abba
[1:27:57] father
[1:27:59] all things are possible unto thee
[1:28:02] take away this cup from me
[1:28:07] but here comes the key
[1:28:09] jesus knew and he expressed it so that
[1:28:12] we could learn from him nevertheless
[1:28:15] not what i will
[1:28:18] but what
[1:28:19] thou wilt
[1:28:22] the context of our life here in america
[1:28:25] and throughout much of what we call the
[1:28:27] western world
[1:28:28] is that of a representative government
[1:28:30] we we vote
[1:28:32] right we express our will
[1:28:34] when jesus was before pilate
[1:28:37] jesus said that his kingdom was not of
[1:28:39] this earth
[1:28:41] during his ministry he spoke many
[1:28:42] parables illustrating what he called not
[1:28:45] the republic of god
[1:28:47] the kingdom of god
[1:28:50] we must realize
[1:28:53] that god is
[1:28:54] sovereign it's all
[1:28:57] about
[1:28:59] him
[1:29:00] it is not
[1:29:01] about us
[1:29:04] he redeemed us
[1:29:06] he got us out of satan's pawn shop that
[1:29:10] makes us
[1:29:11] his property
[1:29:13] we must never forget that he's not a
[1:29:15] genie in the bottle that we can summon
[1:29:18] when we need something done he's not a
[1:29:20] power tool in our toolbox that we can
[1:29:22] apply when we want to accomplish our
[1:29:25] will
[1:29:27] or clay on his potter's wheel
[1:29:31] he's free to smash us reshape us
[1:29:34] fire us in the kiln
[1:29:37] he sees the bigger picture
[1:29:40] the big picture eternity
[1:29:43] and the spiritual realms
[1:29:45] we see a little picture a physical
[1:29:47] universe and a short life within it
[1:29:51] doesn't mean that it's easy
[1:29:53] when we see a loved one
[1:29:55] or ourselves suffering
[1:29:58] dying
[1:30:00] but it also does not mean that god does
[1:30:02] not care when his will doesn't match our
[1:30:05] desires
[1:30:06] that's one of the reasons jesus
[1:30:08] described the holy ghost the holy spirit
[1:30:11] when he comes he'll be
[1:30:13] the comforter
[1:30:16] who needs comforting when everything's
[1:30:17] going wonderfully well
[1:30:20] it's when we're suffering
[1:30:22] when we're distraught
[1:30:24] bewildered
[1:30:26] even angry
[1:30:28] that we need comforting
[1:30:30] the presence
[1:30:32] of those that we know care
[1:30:34] and no one cares for us more than him
[1:30:36] look what he did for us to redeem us
[1:30:39] from that pawn shop
[1:30:41] and that's a role that he loves
[1:30:44] why
[1:30:46] because it deepens our relationship with
[1:30:49] him
[1:30:50] and his with us
[1:30:52] and in the end
[1:30:53] it's all about relationship
[1:30:56] the law
[1:30:57] calvary
[1:30:58] the church ages all of it
[1:31:01] our relationship with him remember
[1:31:04] jesus was asked what is the first what
[1:31:06] is the greatest what is the most
[1:31:07] important commandment and he said love
[1:31:08] the lord your god
[1:31:10] that's relationship with god and he
[1:31:12] added and the second is just like it
[1:31:16] love your neighbor
[1:31:18] so it's our relationship with him and
[1:31:19] our relationship with each other that's
[1:31:22] what matters
[1:31:24] god's kingdom is not a representative
[1:31:27] democracy
[1:31:29] we don't have a vote
[1:31:31] but we do have a choice
[1:31:33] to accept his grace
[1:31:36] or to reject it
[1:31:37] to follow him
[1:31:39] or not
[1:31:42] but he is sovereign
[1:31:45] listen
[1:31:46] to david's prayer as he equipped solomon
[1:31:49] to build the temple
[1:31:53] find this in first chronicles chapter 29
[1:31:57] wherefore david blessed the lord
[1:32:00] before all the congregation
[1:32:02] and david said listen closely to this
[1:32:05] prayer
[1:32:06] blessed be thou
[1:32:08] lord god of israel our father forever
[1:32:12] and ever
[1:32:14] thine o lord
[1:32:17] is the greatness
[1:32:19] and the power
[1:32:21] and the glory
[1:32:23] and the victory
[1:32:24] and the majesty
[1:32:26] for all that is in heaven
[1:32:29] and in the earth
[1:32:31] is thine
[1:32:33] thine
[1:32:34] is the kingdom
[1:32:35] o lord
[1:32:37] and thou art exalted as head above all
[1:32:43] i'm closing this portion of the service
[1:32:45] now
[1:32:48] david's inspired words are almost
[1:32:50] identical
[1:32:51] to what we call
[1:32:53] the lord's prayer
[1:32:55] we find this in matthew 6 think about
[1:32:58] what we just read the david said after
[1:33:00] this manner therefore pray ye
[1:33:02] our father which art in heaven hallowed
[1:33:05] be thy name
[1:33:07] thy kingdom come
[1:33:09] that will be done on earth as it is in
[1:33:11] heaven
[1:33:13] give us this day
[1:33:15] our daily bread
[1:33:17] forgive us our debts
[1:33:20] as we forgive our debtors lead us not
[1:33:23] into temptation
[1:33:25] but deliver us from evil for thine is
[1:33:27] the kingdom
[1:33:28] and the power and the glory forever
[1:33:32] amen so be it
[1:33:34] so my brothers and my sisters
[1:33:37] pray earnestly
[1:33:39] in faith
[1:33:41] nothing doubting
[1:33:43] but if healing or deliverance doesn't
[1:33:46] come
[1:33:47] not the way that you think it should be
[1:33:48] or the way that you want it don't give
[1:33:51] up
[1:33:52] don't be discouraged
[1:33:54] don't blame yourself if only my faith
[1:33:56] were stronger i thought if i believed
[1:33:59] but it didn't happen
[1:34:01] god has the big picture in mind
[1:34:04] preparing us for realms that we only
[1:34:06] know by faith
[1:34:09] we know that all things work together
[1:34:11] for our good
[1:34:13] who are called of god
[1:34:15] according to his purpose as paul said
[1:34:19] now we see through a glass darkly
[1:34:23] but then
[1:34:24] face to face
[1:34:27] as brother aaron comes to end the
[1:34:29] service
[1:34:31] sing with me and help me find the right
[1:34:33] key
[1:34:35] job's god
[1:34:37] maybe we'll start with the chorus
[1:34:40] though
[1:34:41] oh god slay me at all trust him
[1:34:48] i shall
[1:34:50] then come forth as gold
[1:34:53] [Music]
[1:34:55] and i know
[1:34:58] my redeemer lived
[1:35:02] for i fear
[1:35:05] him in my soul
[1:35:09] when i float
[1:35:13] all around me
[1:35:17] and his face
[1:35:20] i cannot see
[1:35:24] yet i know
[1:35:27] that through the ladders
[1:35:31] he
[1:35:33] beholdeth even me
[1:35:37] [Music]
[1:35:39] though
[1:35:40] god slay me yet i'll trust him
[1:35:45] i shall
[1:35:47] then come forth as gold
[1:35:52] for i know
[1:35:55] my redeemers live
[1:35:59] for i feel
[1:36:02] him in my soul
[1:36:06] and o
[1:36:08] god slay me yet i'll trust him
[1:36:13] i shall then
[1:36:16] come forth as gold
[1:36:20] [Music]
[1:36:35] how many times we
[1:36:38] we're
[1:36:39] tempted or
[1:36:41] we give into it to
[1:36:43] go to the lord and say i don't just
[1:36:45] understand lord why why it's got to be
[1:36:47] this way and why it's got to go
[1:36:49] it's not the plans that i had it's not
[1:36:51] how i thought it should be
[1:36:53] but even he when he came to gethsemane
[1:36:55] and he said not my will but thy will be
[1:36:58] done
[1:37:00] and we find that when we finally
[1:37:02] get to that point where we let it go and
[1:37:04] say god
[1:37:06] whatever you desire
[1:37:08] there's a peace that comes with it
[1:37:11] there's some an assurance that comes in
[1:37:13] your heart said god is god is in control
[1:37:16] it doesn't make the pathway any easier
[1:37:19] you still have your troubles you don't
[1:37:21] but there's an assurance that he'll go
[1:37:23] with me
[1:37:25] amen
[1:37:26] sometimes it's good to be reminded
[1:37:28] through the scriptures through the
[1:37:29] events
[1:37:31] of other people's lives that god has has
[1:37:33] recorded for us to see
[1:37:35] that each one of us has a has our
[1:37:37] battles has our life to live
[1:37:40] but he is king and lord of it all amen
[1:37:43] if you'll stand with me
[1:37:45] open my eyes lord i want to see jesus
[1:37:50] he said but my eyes are open
[1:37:52] then lord focus my eyes to you
[1:37:58] open my
[1:38:05] i want to see
[1:38:08] jesus
[1:38:11] [Music]
[1:38:12] to reach
[1:38:17] [Music]
[1:38:20] and say that we love
[1:38:25] you
[1:38:27] [Music]
[1:38:28] open
[1:38:30] my ears
[1:38:35] and help me to
[1:38:41] [Music]
[1:38:45] my
[1:38:47] eyes on
[1:38:50] i want to see
[1:38:53] jesus
[1:38:58] [Music]
[1:39:05] i want to see
[1:39:08] jesus
[1:39:10] [Music]
[1:39:13] to reach out and
[1:39:17] touch him
[1:39:20] and say that we love
[1:39:26] [Music]
[1:39:28] open our ears
[1:39:32] [Music]
[1:39:35] and help us to
[1:39:38] live
[1:39:39] [Music]
[1:39:50] we want to see jesus
[1:39:53] [Music]
[1:39:58] you look at the life of job sometimes
[1:40:00] and you wonder how could a man
[1:40:02] bear
[1:40:04] what he went through
[1:40:07] but when your vision is looking at the
[1:40:09] lord
[1:40:10] when your vision has seen that
[1:40:12] it helps you to go through those things
[1:40:15] i sometimes i've read the
[1:40:18] the history or the the story of of
[1:40:20] different
[1:40:21] famous christians that were well known
[1:40:24] life was not easy
[1:40:26] life was a struggle life was hard
[1:40:29] but their vision was
[1:40:30] that end goal
[1:40:32] not only for them but lord for those
[1:40:35] around me that i could take them with me
[1:40:37] wanting wanting to share that
[1:40:40] i thought how many times jesus looked
[1:40:42] over jerusalem and said
[1:40:44] jerusalem jerusalem how oft
[1:40:48] and if you go back to the scriptures and
[1:40:50] you see how many times he looked over
[1:40:52] israel even with moses even with david
[1:40:55] and that was the heart of god reaching
[1:40:57] out
[1:40:58] he does the same thing with us and he
[1:40:59] says son daughter
[1:41:01] what you're going through is good for
[1:41:03] you
[1:41:04] what you're going through will teach you
[1:41:07] will come bring you under subjection
[1:41:09] for that other life
[1:41:11] that other world
[1:41:13] and so we say lord i surrender all
[1:41:16] brother matthew had to sing great is thy
[1:41:18] faithfulness and sing that chorus
[1:41:22] [Music]
