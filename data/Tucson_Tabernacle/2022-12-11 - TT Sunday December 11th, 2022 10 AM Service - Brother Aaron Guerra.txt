Lord as you minister to us and we thank you Lord because you said you would Lord has helped us to receive it now we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen thank you you may be seated thank you thank you just a couple of announcements remember at four o'clock this afternoon the memorial service for our brother Robert Chacon and um I we were bringing some of the food and things in and if you ever watch brother Robert when the food were there he'd get a little bag and he put a handful of things and then he'd go set it somewhere so he would have some after service for himself and as I was put there I just said Robert you can't do that today you got to wait for the rest of us so just spending this week thinking it's about some of the things and I appreciate that God allows us to have good memories and precious things to remember to comfort ourselves and then this coming Thursday through Sunday the meetings here at the Tabernacle with our brother Joe Adams and our brother Aaron Oglesby so we're going to cancel Wednesday night service and we'll start Thursday at 7 pm Friday at 7 pm Saturday at six and Sunday morning at 10 A.M brother Joe and brother Aaron had asked for the one service and then a fellowship after on on Sunday so we've invited the local churches and the folks around and made it made them welcome so folks said they are coming but I know one who promised he said he'd be here so let's just just just wait on that and see what what God would do for us so and um this morning um I woke up early and I'd ask the Lord just just just give me a give me some a precious dream give me something just to encourage me and he didn't but he's still God and um but something came in my heart just on I guess it would have been Thursday and of all the things that we should be anticipating and looking for that's the soon coming of the Lord that should be our priority but in that priority and in that I I was talking to a brother brother today and and I said you know we we want we just memories and things we want we want to we want to take as many as we can with us so I was thinking about that and I said Lord you know we want you to I would want you to come today take us home today but at the same time I want that opportunity for others and and so there was that was in my heart and just some things reading reading some scriptures and things that brother Branham said and experiences in life and the the scripture that came to me is that just spoke to my heart was found in Genesis chapter 18 when Abraham is talking to God when God comes down and talks to him about about Sodom he was going to go down to Sodom and and destroy for their wickedness and all if we're living in a wicked generation it's now the things that are that are happening but the spirit of Abraham called out to to God and he said we're just going to take one of the verses 18 32. but Abraham looks and he says to God he said if there be 50. left and Sodom that are still righteous or still seeking your face would you withheld withhold your destruction and God tells them yes for 50 I will not destroy the city I think Abraham had a good idea that there was not 50 there so he drops it down to 40. and God says for 40. and he drops it down to 20. and he drops it down to 10. and God says Abraham for ten I will not destroy this city and that's where he says and he said oh let not the Lord be angry and I will speak yet but this once pray Adventure 10 shall be found there and he said I will not destroy it for Ten's sake and and as I I was thinking about then I sort of said Lord you are merciful you are long-suffering and and sometimes if it was if it was being given to us we might have said enough is enough I'm done with this but here's Abraham the father of our faith saying is there but an opportunity for one more and and it was just my heart and but the thought was what is that what if this was Resurrection morning I heard a brother speaking to this and it just just stirred my heart up and they said did you wake up this morning at six o'clock and think sometime between six and nine in the morning he's coming did you wake up there and say could it be this morning or did we just get up and go and continue on our business and it really struck a a a chord in my uh a thought in me and I say Lord I know that when I get up and I go I I speak with you and oh sometimes driving me into work I'll listen to a portion of a message or pray or whatever but my mind is more on what I have to accomplish that day work wise whatever it might be and got to be here got to be there got to text and they want me here first and my mind is more on that than Lord could this be that morning and what a day that will be it you know and just thinking about some of those things and it set my heart to think a little bit about that I said let me just Lord let me just talk to the congregation a little bit about this maybe in the morning when you wake up and I don't know what time you get up some are up very early and some not so early and but between six and nine remember said that Resurrection those saints that died in Christ are going to are going to be but be appearing and I said could it be this morning and if not this morning will it be tomorrow morning and if not the next morning then Lord let me anticipate it every morning first of all but also then as as I begin to think about that but what about others Lord that don't have this hope or maybe some that are going through a hard struggle and and wondering and and battling and they've been hurt they've been they've been Cast Away and all and I thank God that he is a god of The Castaways also because what chance would we have you know we were talking about some of the things that going back I was raised in church my whole life I've really never known the world but I could have become a very self-righteous Christian I've done enough Lord you have to take me home I think God hates that Spirit more than the other one the one that says just one more time lord would you have I think he just rather than Lord I think about the the man that stood there and he's praying he says Lord you know and then he says I'm thank I'm God I'm not like that public in there and and the Publican is saying have mercy on me One More Time Lord and God look to that public and Abraham's heart was reaching out because he had a nephew there and he had some loved ones there and he had and they were he was calling God if there's a possibility would you not destroy that City for that one you might look back at your own family or a loved one or maybe a neighbor or a good friend and saying God could you reach out and minister to that one could you reach out and touch their hearts someone some way myself somebody else could get to them and give them give them a hope Inspire something in them so if this was Resurrection morning what would our actions be how would we how would we behave in ourselves well how would what would be thinking how would we be acting I've shared this with be before with you and I knew that I wasn't out living in the world but I knew that I wasn't serving the lord that I like I should be around eighth grade or so and if I got home and Mama wasn't at home my mom wasn't home I'd start calling all over till I found her and I would say good Rapture hasn't taken place yet we chuckle about it now but it was a fear in me and then later I thought how come you never felt that way about Dad because Dad was working okay but Mom was supposed to be home so that okay that's an eighth grader working this way until one day I met God for myself and then it changed then it was if he comes today I'm going with him also but when you have the spirit of God and and it which was in Abraham you would say Lord is there a chance and opportunity for one more for my brother for my sister for my neighbor for that sinner in the world whoever that is an opportunity to get to know you and and it doesn't take God 20 years to get somebody ready he could turn around and say this day you'll be with me in Paradise I remember my father-in-law when he was he had gotten sick and they'd take him to the hospital and he couldn't hardly breathe and do through some things that he had gone through he had felt he had turned his back on God he never forgave himself for so many years we would talk to him and we would encourage him he wasn't living a life of sin going out to the world but he just just didn't he felt like he had he had offended God and and we tried over the years and he would tell us you go to church you serve the Lord but I can't he got quite sick he was taken to the hospital they called my wife and they call my dad to go over and pray for him my dad got to spend about two hours with him there at the hospital bed at TMC and my dad began to talk to him and say because at that point he had not been intubated yet and he could still talk but he's having a lot of trouble breathing and right there in the bed he made his heart right before God how long does it take to make your heart rate and right then and there so by the time my wife got to the hospital he had been intubated and he could no longer speak so my wife asked him daddy are you okay and he said are you afraid and he goes no are you ready to go and he goes yes doesn't take any more than that for God to reach down so you say well you know it's it's taken me well for me now 63 years to get here but for that one next to the Head crossed that very day he met God in Paradise and and this same God in John 11. chapter 11 21-26 he's taken on flesh he's walking on this Earth he's he's amongst his disciples he's he's amongst all the people you know and he's walking he's we don't know all the things he said but the scriptures do say that if everything was written and recorded what he did the books could not hold so so it it just you know he was in amongst the people he he did he didn't hide himself from everybody when they went and they asked Mary could you ask Jesus to do something about this obviously they had heard they had seen that he was able to do things speak and things happen but here we know about Lazarus here in John 11 verses 21 to 26 . when we know that Lazarus had passed away and Jesus just tells his disciples we'll go later he's sleeping no well then he's doing no he's passed away but there was a reason why he was going to go at that time now we know he's come close and then Martha said unto Jesus Lord if thou Hat's been here my brother had not died they were confident they were sure in that they knew what he was able to do but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it thee obviously something had happened in their lives something they had seen they had this confidence they had got to know God he had become personal to them a friend to them that the the if we could say the news and all had gotten around about out about him what he was able to do so she says that and Jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again and she said amen you can read the next scripture Martha said unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day and and I have that same promise you have that same confidence amen those that have gone to sleep and go and God will rise that's a promise but she didn't realize Resurrection was standing right there in front of her talking to her and and so he says thy brother she goes I know he shall rise again in the resurrection in that last day Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and you know what a promise we have what an encouragement we have to think we went the other day and had not been to uh to the cemetery in a while but we went to pick up brother Robert's remains and I thought of those folks that are buried in South lawn that we know family and friends part of the church and different ones and we know their bodies would lay there but that's not going to stop them they're not going to be knocking on that top of that coffin saying somebody get me out no no no there's a resurrection a promise and he says yes and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die then he asks believeth thou this and I have to ask you the same thing do you believe this yourself do you have that same confidence is it an assurance in your life that though the skin worms destroy this body job is looking over and he's seen and he said I've seen I I've seen the weather change and I see the weather pattern and and in Spring we begin to see the the plants butt up we begin to see the growth and all and summer comes and it develops but fall comes and we begin to see the change and and then in into winter and they disappear but the next spring they rise again but I've seen men laid into the ground and I've never seen them come up again but something down inside of Joe cries I know my redeemer liveth and with these eyes I Shall Behold Him and so this this was what was in my heart of thinking These Eyes Shall Behold Him it's not hey you know I saw him but it's going to be able to say I have seen him I have to walk with him I I my own brothers and sisters those that have we've gotten to know here at the Tabernacle and or wherever that have gone on Christians without hope and I see Sister Barbara and sister glidewell their brother George and sister Mike brother Mike sorry about that brother Mike you know to think about them to come walking in I might not know them because I don't know that I'm going to know them at 21 years old My Sister Barbara and sister Gladwell the joy what a day that'll be you know I I think about it I I remember my grandmother on both sides of the family they were older so that's my picture of them I've seen pictures of them but my dad had an experience the Lord spoke he gave him a vision asking when this message came and he gave his heart to it asking why some of his other family had nobody said I know my mother had been a Christian all her life and the Lord showed her to me at about 19 years old dressed in white and she comes and she puts her arm on my shoulder and she talks to me it's a reality it is a reality it's it's brother John Rojas a good friend of ours he was passing away with with cancer and him and his wife were in the room the doctor said just given him just a a few weeks to live and we had known him back in the Pentecostal Church in California when the message came they moved to Arizona and and you know here and and he had had been filled with cancer and the doctors gave him a couple a week and while he was in the room and his wife saw it also an angel came into the room and told them well done not good and faithful servant you'll be going home those promises are true they are alive they are real in one of these mornings it's going to happen I think of brother Jose Ramirez brother Daniel Ramirez's father who in the 40s had been an interpreter for brother Branham but didn't follow didn't understand the message till later in his life but when he was sick and he was coming close to death and his wife and his daughter were sitting around him and he didn't he said I haven't eaten hey he hadn't eaten and they were trying to encourage him to eat and she was saying Daddy you know you need to eat you're getting weak you're losing your strength and he turned and looked at him he says I just ate and he's laying there in bed and they knew he just hadn't eaten because he's been laying there a bit and they said you just ate and he began to call out the names of those that had passed on he said they were just here with me and he called up he called out the name and I believe it was brother Mike Bear's little sister that had passed away very young he said she just gave me something to eat and they realized that he was closer to the other side than this side now the reality of a resurrection amen I hope that we have that lies within us amen great is his faith then their words to him was Daddy greet Danny for us when you cross over and he went home now what a way to go what a way to go but the Lord has Jesus asked Mary Martha he says do you believe this do you have enough Faith are you confident that it's for you also though the though God slay me as I'll trust him job said with these eyes I shall see my redeemer foreign go to Matthew chapter 27. verses 50 to 53. and this is crucifixion day and when he had Jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost and behold the veil of the temples was rent in Twain From the top to the bottom and the Earth did quake and the Rocks rent foreign and many bodies of the Saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many it's written in the scriptures because it is true it's it's you you you base your faith on the scriptures and it is true God is faithful and appeared to many and and they began to begin to to see them could could you imagine that brother green had a dream I believe it was brother green that had the dream and he saw some of the brothers who we all knew of much older brothers here at the church and I don't remember all the ones he saw but he was standing there and these young men came up to him and began to talk to him and I just blanked on his name he used to do the sound yeah brother Murray if I believe it was him and he was it was a short brother and he's standing there and he saw me goes he don't remember me he don't know me he don't know who I am it was brother Murray as a Young Man what a promise we have yes but let's not put it so far away it could be in the morning some glad morning when this life is over he said brother Aaron I've got a lot of things I'd like to do me too some of those I've given up on him I'll never be a star athlete not that I ever really wanted to be but I've kind of gave a brother Dan Evan sent me a text yesterday I heard a rumor it was your birthday and I said yeah it's the 63rd time that rumor has been mentioned you know Life Goes On but one of these days bro Dan you're going to see me like when I was about 21 years old with a full mustache got a text although you've been around for a while got a text from Joshua Hernandez saying happy birthday and we got to writing and I said how do you remember me and this was his words he said I had lunch with Pancho Villa because I used to wear a full mustache and I started laughing because I forgot that that's what they used to call me him and Nate and some of the young men at that age and I told him I don't have it anymore and he said what said yeah it stopped growing on some of the spots and it was spotty and I asked mama if I could my wife if I could shave it off and she had never seen me without it and she said no I don't know but then she told me to go ahead and shave it off and I did Sunday morning came to church and sister Martha Peterson turned around looked at me said you're shaved your mustache off and three days later I told my wife I shaved my mustache off and she goes really when I I appreciate God having a sense of humor don't you but the things that that in life and we look back now I'm further this way than that way but I have a hope I have a promise I have more than I have an assurance in my life that is what the Seal of the Holy Ghost does in your life it's a Blessed assurance as job said though God slay me yet the SK the skin words would eat this body I have a promise with these eyes I shall see Jesus tells her I am the resurrection and and and and at that you have to realize and they say yes Lord you are the resurrection and you're living in me and that's how I will be Resurrected now Paul tells us in Thessalonians chapter 4. verses 13 through 18. I don't know what the discussions were I don't know what the people were saying but you can read in the description say that they had said we've heard this promise people have told us this for many years but where is this coming and sometimes we probably get feeling the same way Lord our seems like it's taken forever it's amazing how how some things just seem to take forever when you're younger but the older you get you're like wow that's here again already it's already gone through so fast it seems like time just seems to speed up talking to a young man and he told me he says I'm going to be 40 this year and he says and it's going to be starting downhill and I I just wanted to make him feel good you know and I said no you're at the bottom of the hill already watching others tumble and he said thanks a lot well he's about 50 now and he says you're not kidding were you I said life seems to speed up as time goes on things you know but Paul says I would not have you be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that yeast sorrow not even as others which have no hope great is thy faithful faithfulness your father you you it's not just words in a book but a reality an experience that we each have that we get that we get to grow up with that we get to to get to know him a faithful God uh Abby my daughter the other day or yesterday I get was sent a text to the family they're they're adding the second portion to their house and working on it and Amos had ordered a box of screws the specific screws for that portion of the job and then couldn't find them and they had to be ordered so it post that ordered again the cost and the time so she just sent a text out he said would you pray that we find it and we did and when someone when someone sends out a request take a moment to pray then just just you never know maybe he'll Touch the Hem of His Garment for somebody so we prayed in a couple little bit later she said we had gone and we had searched we had looked and we walked around and the place we had looked when you said them they were not there and when we bat went back that box was right there God is more than able if he will do that for a simple thing like that and what would he do for one of his children the hope that we have that lies within us Paul says I don't want you to be ignorant I want you to know this I want you to be aware of this he says for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again and every evidence of that happening is here he says even sow them which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord in what can be more sure there is nothing more sure than the word of God you can hang your Eternal destination on the word of God he says that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep and he says they're not dead they're asleep they're resting and you know it if God and we're talking about him and my wife coming in just a little bit today and the creation with Adam being created and Eve being taken from his side and and all you know as you start to think about those things and you begin to imagine we have the scripture we've heard Brothers preach what brother Brown said but but sometimes you're just being what was it like how long was that time Adam Adam didn't have to attend the uh you know attend the soil in the way he had to after and all that went on you know brother Branham talks about he would say uh Abel Adam he says you know can you change the breathe breathe and bring it this way it's a little bit different now it's honey I turn the air conditioner a little then cool down the room and she said no it's too cold already or right now she's like turned that heater off and I say I'm freezing you know and and but Adam could just say Breeze turn and go the other way kind of hard to believe that sometimes but they were poor they were a creation of God and there was no sin no iniquity and no nothing their word was as good as his works God had told Adam you go through and you name all the animals and he named them to their character you name the the plants the trees and everything it was such a Harmony there and you got this same promise that as we look into the Crypt them those are a living will not prevent will not will not hold it up it says them which are asleep because that's all they are sleeping waiting for that call he says but I like this then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord I pray that that's a hope that's a reality that's a revelation in your life and you say well Lord you know I I've just not done all that good I've got some things in my life I would say fix it I would say repent of it I would say make it right don't let nothing get in your way we've done you know we've made plans and we're going to do this we're going to go that and sometimes those plans started a year or two ago a while back sometimes the plans are five minutes before it happens but some things and you make all all the the preparations for it maybe you're going to go on a trip and you you make the uh you get out you make reservations and you start setting some finances aside and you start making preparations for all of that with a hope that when that time comes that day comes you're going to be ready to go and you're going to be able to go and I don't know about you but when I know I'm leaving early early the next morning I have a hard time sleeping until about an hour before it's time to go then I fall asleep and then it's time to get up and there are some people that can lay down and sleep and get up when it's time to go every one of the different but there's something that says we shall meet him in the air there shall there will be a resurrection there's evidence of the Resurrection and then Paul finishes it wherefore Comfort one another with these words it won't be long now it won't be long now you know brother Banner makes a statement he says live like he's coming today your life should be ready if he should call you at any moment ready to go but he said plan like he's not coming for a hundred years I find people flip that they live like he's not coming for a hundred years but playing like he's coming today and I saw that happen 1977. those had put their whole Hope on that and when it didn't happen watched how they faded away their lives they quit working they quit going to school they did a lot of things and life was tough after that but if we'll take What God Says for us to do and believe it and live by that God will see us get through that part where for Comfort one another with these words he's coming soon there's more fulfilled in the word of God today than there ever had been more things that we see the falling away the the filth of the world what what what Adam what Abraham was crying out for salvation because of what was going on in Sodom and Gomorrah and there was something God said I'm coming down to destroy and Adam Abraham's crying out because he knew who was there he had a nephew down there and he was calling out for that one but there's going to come that day when this is that day and maybe every morning just a thought every morning now could this be Resurrection morning could this be that day it would change how we live it would change our thoughts it would take some of that gloom and that that heartache and that that frustration and say Lord this could be that day this could be that day we're going home this could be David I'll be changed from Mortal to immortal what a day that'll be some of you young people may think and brother and you've lived your life already you've had the opportunity to to do things and see things Mary and have a family and all yes I have by the grace of God but this is greater than any of that it is brother Branham says in my life story in 1959 I gave him that quote and here he was and he's talking to his sister hope there and I looked over and shook her there she was she had went down from about 120 pounds to about 60. and that shook her and if I live to be a hundred years old I'll never forget what happened she turned over in those great big pretty eyes looked up at me and she smiled she said why did you call me back I'll tell you on that side you're never going to want to come back to this life again but while I'm in yet in this life I want to reach out and grab somebody by the hand and say come go with me he says I said honey I just got the cast I just had to work and it was not was we was way in debt and a hundred hundreds of dollars of doctor bills and nothing to pay it with and I just had to work and I seen her two or three times a day and every night and then when she was in that condition and I said what do you mean call you back she said now watch this bill you preached about it you talked about it but you don't have any idea what it is we've waited for a long time some are just starting their Journey some have been at a journey for quite some time now and God has allowed us to have some glimpse of some blessing some some touch some experiences in life that tell us he's so real but he tells her he says what are you talking about she said Heaven she said look I was being escorted by some peoples men or women or something they were dressed in white and she said I was at ease and peace big pretty birds flying from tree to tree she said don't think I'm beside myself she says it's real it's for sure it's yes and amen it's eternal she says I'm not beside myself I was on that side brother Branham said you know he continues there and he talks about that the the memories and and things of of all that happened but she was a witness of the truth of that just sharing some experiences about it my dad had a good friend and I remember him as we were young people in the church he was older than my father but he was a Christian and um in the church that we went to and when we were just children young children when those people they were part of the original Pentecostal group way back when they would have prayer meetings in their Church they'd call the fire department because the church was on fire and the fire department got there and it wouldn't be on fire would just be the Holy Spirit outside the church going up and down those were testimonies about people like that it was real it's still real amen and and it was a good friend of my dad's and the brother Aguilar can show I believe his name and he had in the early 60s he had heard brother Branham preach he had gone to the meeting and um he had come back and told my dad he was older my father he said I've never heard that was a man of God I've never heard anything or seen anything like that yet they had been raised in the Pentecost church that still had the power of God in it and so we come into the message later a few years later than that and um my dad says I'm going to take the tape to him so he could hear it to see if this who that was so my dad takes it over to his house and they play the tape and he begins to cry that's him that's him that's him I'll never forget the voice that was the man of God so my dad says oh right I'm gonna be able to give him the message and he's going to hear he's going to believe it and he passes it away right after that so my dad asked the Lord why why couldn't I give him the message show my dad is a man who who sees visions and dreams and he said the Lord showed his friend can show being taken by two angels dressed in white he just waved to my dad and said I'm going home now that's a reality it's not a fantasy it's not a it's not just for the the ones in the Bible it's for every child of God it's for everyone you say well but I've made I made a mess in my life I've done so much wrong I've been a failure look at me look at this it don't take but an instant I'm just saying Lord I'm sorry and he forgives you he looked at Legion a man of thousands of music and he delivered him and what if that man he came to him and says his senses and gave his heart to God okay Lord told me okay now you go to Seminary you study for the next 25 years and you get to know all the scriptures and you get to know where everything's at and understand all the Mysteries then come talk to me again no no when God comes into a man's life a lady's life it changes them God is more than able in the message a rejected King we'll finish with this here in fact if the musicians want to come up and so I heard something say would you like to see beyond the curtain and I said it would help me so much wouldn't it wouldn't it be something just to be able to step into that that Dimension that atmosphere just for a little while he says and I looked and in just a moment one breath I had come into a little place that slanted I looked back and there I was laying on the bed and I said this is a strange thing now I would what would not want you to repeat this this is before my church or my sheep that I'm pastoring he said whether whether it was I was in this body or not whether it was a translation it wasn't like any Vision I ever had and I could look there and I could look there here and when when I hit that little place I'd never seen so many people come running screaming oh our precious brother and I looked a young woman maybe in their early 20s 18 to 20 and they were throwing their arms around me and screaming our precious brother Here Comes young men in the Brilliance of Young Manhood and their eyes glistening looking like stars on a darkened night their teeth as white as Pearl and they were screaming and grabbing me and screaming oh our precious brother and I stopped and look and I was young I looked back my old body laying there and my hand it's behind my head and I said I don't understand this it's real one more testimony these are personal for us when my sister my older sister my mom was in the hospital and had my sister my mom was diagnosed with tuberculosis and there this would be in the mid 50s my sisters were born my sister was born in 57. and tuberculosis was was a a disease that killed people and dad would work and then he'd come home and he'd go see her at the hospital so he came home to pray that day before he went to go see Mom and um he was in his body praying and suddenly he was lifted up out of his body and I remember that because that's how he tells us about it he lifted up a lot of his body and he could see himself still kneeling down praying and then that light took him to the hospital but took him down the same roads he drove took him quickly and they left him outside the hospital and the light went into the room he said I knew which was your mother's room I saw the light go into that room and then I fell back down into my body he said when I get to the hospital the doctors told me we don't know what happened but she doesn't have tuberculosis anymore he's still God he never fails he's the same yesterday today and forever and it could be Resurrection morning it won't be long now it won't be long now it doesn't take 20 years to get ready it just takes a repentive heart you know humble Spirit say Lord help me meet with me changed my life it's about our hands what a promise we have part I did nothing to deserve it Lord but you gave it to me and I appreciate it I love you for it may we have that expectation may it never leave us may we never get so caught up with the things that are happening around us that we forget you're coming soon

divided brother Aaron received 44 percent of the vote and to continue 56 point of the vote so the congregation has spoken that they'd like to continue seeking for seeking another brother for the position and basically voted no for brother Aaron so brother Aaron would you like to come up and say something I know this is uh it's hard but it's been a long road and I'd like to thank brother Aaron his family it's not an easy thing to stand up here and give the the results and I'd like to foreign I'd like to personally thank you when brother green died or went home should I say this brother is the one that stepped in when no one else would carried a load for the last seven years it's not been easy on brother Aaron he's not getting any younger as he mentioned this morning but we owe him a debt of gratitude and he's one of the finest Brothers I know and thank you brother Aaron I know it's not easy to share this but I I truly truly appreciate you and your family for all that you've done or they had said I could say something so something then it's been a fun seven years in one size and side has been a hard seven years but on all things God has had his his will done appreciate your prayers I appreciate your support it's um something that I never imagined would I would ever do but thank the Lord that he has allowed it the other day we just we got to thinking and remembering back when we first came I was 29 years old when we got to the Tabernacle just a young man and it didn't take long for for to get just get started in doing things in the church here appreciate your prayers appreciate your all that you have done for us in I know at times I've failed and this never was my intention to fail anybody or hurt anybody but we're human and I've I've said this and I'll continue to say this this is my home Church unless God tells me to go somewhere else and he hasn't said that so I will continue to put my shoulder to the wheel as best I can and whatever that amount of time takes to get to who the Lord would send our way whether it's somebody local or somebody you know it I'll put my shoulder the wheel and I'll ask each one of you to put your shoulder to the wheel also in your prayer and your support and your attendance and everything else and see what God has for us I I've been asked by others if I would go out and minister and from other other folks in other places if I would go Minister for them and I always said this is home I don't feel that way and I still don't feel that way but if God allows that maybe we'll do make up a few that we had said we would and we never did but this is home this is where my heart is and I want to be here when we all go home together so keep us in prayer it'll take some adjustment but I'll help every way I can to get to that next stage and I'll still pray for you he promised to pray for me I appreciate that and uh one side of me just went okay but that's all right and I I didn't tell anybody but I told my boss and my job I said I don't know what's going to happen but if if this position demands more time I'll be able to spend less time at work or I'll want to spend less time at work let's just be honest with that so Friday they called me and said what can we do to keep you and I said we'll talk about that later and as long as the Lord wants us to be here and do what we can do we're willing to do that so I'll say to each one of you thank you thank you for your prayers thank you for your kindness thank you for putting up with me but I pray one of these days where I'll be going home together so God bless you we'll walk in the light such a beautiful light if you want to finish we'll walk in the light [Music] shine all around us Jesus [Music] later once more when walking [Music] shine all around

bow our heads oh Lord Jesus I mean just ask your mercy Lord and Grace to show us what you want Lord It's it's pretty simple across the board maybe the vote wasn't entirely one way or one way or the other Lord but when I look out and I think about the brothers and sisters in this church lord it's very obvious to me Lord that it really is just simply Lord what do you want so we love you Lord We Worship You Lord we praise your name I don't know the answers Lord you haven't given that to me Lord but Lord I'm seeking you and holding on to you Lord as we go about this day Lord about our weak
