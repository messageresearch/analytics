when his disciples saw it they rebuked them but Jesus called them unto him and he said suffer the little children to come to me and forbid them not for such is the kingdom of God Mark tells the same story and he says he Mark says and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and he took them up in his arms and put his hands on them and blessed them verse 17 out of Luke verily I say unto you Jesus speaking whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein friends all children every birth comes from God every birth is a gift from God they are brought in this world dependent on their mother on their father on their family to teach them what is right and what is wrong they were given to us to have stewards over for these

listened to the testimonies that were given over Thanksgiving and and one of the ones that meant so much to me was brother lion sister Lonnie and the kindness that they said and and one of the things was that you all accepted us brother Lionel said he said uh these words that I get choked up every time I say it he said when something on the order of when we go to the other side and he said this he said if the Lord has mercy on me that I can make it to the other side and I thought brother that's the way that we all we all should be um I want to thank you for for that kindness and and your family

father I pray that your blessings would be upon him he would grow in in the teachings of God and Father that he would live a blessed life in Jesus name we pray amen thank you sister God bless you thank [Applause] you my friend bless you what more honor could we have than to raise a child and to lead a child to Jesus Christ through our own testimony as a parent it's a burden that the Lord has placed on us to do that and I pray that you know as the kids get older you never stop being a mom or a dad you always have a burden for your family and I pray that really I really do I'm really thankful that they brought these two children up here and I believe that the Lord has special things in store let's turn in the scriptures my sermon today is is is based on an experience I had a few years ago something a friend of mine said to me and um it's based on a scripture from Hebrews um it's about the sins these sins that so easily beset us I want to start in 1 Corinthians chapter 6:9 and then I'm going to go through scriptures fairly quickly but I'm I'm reading these to lay a foundation for my message this morning morning says this know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor effeminate effeminate homosexual nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkers nor reelers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God and such were some of you but you are washed but you are Sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but I will not be brought under the power of any Meats for the belly and belly for the meats but God shall destroy both it and them now the body is not for fornication but for the Lord and the Lord for the body and God hath both raised up the Lord and will also raise up Us by his own power I'll skip to uh let's skip to the next the next um the next scripture which is Proverbs chapter 6 verse 16 it says this these things do the Lord hate yay seven are in an abomination a unto him a proud look a lying tongue hands that shed innocent blood a heart that deviseth Wicked imaginations feet that be Swift in running to Mischief a false witness that speaketh lies and he that sth Discord among Brethren Colossians chapter 3 verse 11 says this where there is neither Greek nor Jew circumcised ision nor uncircumcision Barbarian schian Bond or free but Christ is all and in all put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of Mind meekness longsuffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do do ye and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of per of perfectness that charity means Modern English means love and let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which also ye are called in one body and be ye thankful let's go to Ephesians chapter 4 verse 26 it says this be ye angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon on your wrath neither give place to the devil let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labor working with his hands the thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth look at the big purpose of working there is that so you can give it away let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers remember edifying is building up and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of your Redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be you kind one to another tenderhearted forgive one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you these are the Commandments of the Lord through these different scriptures and finally the Lord Jesus said this in St John 14:21 he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him Judas saith unto him not is Carrot Lord how is it that thou wi manifest thyself unto us and not to the world the disciples asking Jesus how he is going to manifest himself to the chosen people and then Jesus turns right about right back around to his disciple and puts the burden on the disciple Jesus answered and said unto him if a man loves me he will keep my words do you believe this is his words he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our Abode with him he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which ye hear is not mine but the fathers which sent me again my sermon it's titled here the sins that so easily beset us I was out for a walk with a friend of mine when I was in the ministry in Jeffersonville and uh during lunch during a lunch break and we were talking I can't remember what the exact conversation was but we were talking about some of the sins that um that that people had done and he made this statement to me he said this he said we all have our vices Vice is a sin and when he said that kind of kind of struck me and I didn't like the statement I didn't like it at all kind of gave me the creeps like well we all we we all have these sins and uh and it bothered me and so I was I thought about that for years now that we all have our sins we all have these things in our lives that that we do that maybe we know we do that we shouldn't be doing and I want to read a story about a man that had those sins in his life and he didn't take care of him go to Luke chapter 19 I'm sorry Luke chapter 16 verse 19 it says this there was a certain rich man man which was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every year that sumptuously means extravagantly he was a very rich man and there was a certain beggar named Lazarus which was laid at his gate full of sores and Desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table moreover the dog came and licked his sores very very poor man Street person and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the Angels into Abraham's bosom the rich man also died and was buried and in hell this rich man and in hell he lifted up his eyes being in torments and seeth Abraham a far off and and Lazarus the homeless man the poor man in his bosom and he cried and said Father Abraham have mercy on me and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for I am in torment in this flame notice he is calling Abraham his father he is what we would call call a son of Abraham know we have we sing the song that we are all spiritual sons of Abraham the faith that Abraham had had and the promise that God gave Abraham and we say we are his sons and here is this man in hell and he is claiming that I am a son of Abraham and yet I'm in hell send this poor man just to dip his finger in water and cool this Burning the suffering but Abraham said [Music] Son remember that thou in thy lifetime receivest thy receivest thyy good things and likewise Lazarus evil things but now he is comforted and thou art tormented and beside all this between us and you there is a great Gulf fixed so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot this there's no passing this this gulf that's between us neither can they pass us that would come from the hence so you can't send anybody here and we can't send anybody down there this gulf is not crossable and that is the sin that was in this man's life has created this gulf we're not told what this what this sin is but soon we're going to hear a similar story about another man that we do know what his sin was brother brandom tells us that this man that we are reading about right now is the same man that I am going to read about here in a couple chapters later in the Book of Luke many scholars say that he's the same man that this was a prophecy from the Lord Jesus saying here's what's going to happen to this man that's to come in fact this man in this story had a spirit of a minister he had a spirit of an evangelist there he is in hell with the same Ministry wanting to come out from him how do we know that verse number 27 then he said I pray thee therefore the man that's in hell I pray thee therefore father that thou would us send him to my father's house he's asking to send the beggar named Lazarus to his home to his living family for I have five Brethren that he may testify unto them lest they also come in into this place of Torment so there he is this man in hell and he is worried about his family that they're going to end up in the same place he is this is a horrible story he's trying to keep his loved ones out and he wants to warn them Abraham saith unto him they have Moses and the prophets let them hear them so Abraham said he he says they have Moses they have the prophets they've got a Bible they've got prophets they should be able to find their salvation in the word of God and he said no Father Abraham but if one went unto them from the dead they will repent he's saying that if there was a miracle if someone if this Lazarus would rise from the dead and they would see Lazarus rise from the dead and Lazarus went over to his family to his brothers and said repent stop sinning then they would believe it how many of us had said the same thing if I would just see a miracle if I would just see a supernatural thing happen then I would know that this is right and this man that's in the in hell right now he is saying if you would just sin this then they would believe now watch Abraham's response and he said unto him if they hear not Moses and the prophets neither will they be pers persuaded though one rose from the dead he's saying that the Bible is sitting in front of them telling them not to lie Not to cause Discord among Believers not to lose your temper even if you devise something in your mind that someone is doing wrong Proverbs 6:18 the seven things that God hates then you are sinning all of those sins that I read earlier in those scriptures yet they still won't repent you can read it right here that you are sinning but yet we still continue on in our sins and we don't repent and here is this man he's in hell and he's crying out don't come where I've come repent of what you've been doing and Abraham says listen no matter what happens they're going to continue on doing what they're doing now again we believe that this man that was in Hell he's mentioned here in a couple scriptures a couple uh verses or a couple chapters later and I had it on my heart it's really a neat testimony I had in my heart as I was as I was thinking about this and I was praying like Lord I see so much sin I see so so many things going wrong and people will not they're going to continue what they're doing no matter what I say no matter what your Bible says they just continue on because they want it and I was praying about that I was just troubled this week and I believe the Lord laid on my heart two stories and it's amazing how these two stories go together and I I look them both up and they're in the same chapter Luke chapter 18 verse 9 now one thing I want to point out is there is a difference between a parable and something that actually happened a parable is a story that Jesus uses to prove a point to prove a narrative and it's not a literal not necessarily a literal occurrence but then there are things that actually happened so we're going to see here we're going to see a parable and then we're going to see something that actually happened and he spake this Parable unto certain which trusted themselves that they were righteous and despised others so he's talking about a self-righteous person now Daniel was telling me a story about a coworker that he has she grew up in a Catholic boarding school and she was telling Daniel she she said I don't want anything to do with church I I haven't since I got out of that school she said because everything that I did they were always telling me I was going to hell you do this you're going to hell and the young lady no matter how hard she tried she was always condemned by the nuns you're going to go to hell and she said why do I even try and she tells Daniel she says I believe in God but I don't want anything to do with the church because I'm always condemned we need to be careful always condemning but it doesn't mean that we don't point out sin my job is to bring the sin to you now you deal with it because you're the one in the situation I have no right to condemn because every time I point my finger at somebody out in this audience there's a lot more ping fingers point right back at me because I am I need the grace of God verse number 10 two wom went two men went up into the temple to pray the one a Pharisee and the other a Publican Pharisees is a minister as we know Publican is a Tax Collector someone who was generally thought of as a traitor cheater Lo life the Pharisees stood and prayed thus within himself God I thank thee that I am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers remember the scripture I just said where Paul said these people wouldn't enter into the kingdom of heaven and he's saying I'm thankful that I'm not like that I'm not an extortioner I'm not unjust I'm not an adulterer or I'm not even like this guy over here this Publican I fast twice a week I give tithes of all that I possess and the Publican standing a far off would not lift up so much as his eyes in under heaven heaven but smoked upon his breast saying God be merciful to me a sinner so we have two right here we have one saying I'm thankful that I'm not like all of these other people that aren't that aren't doing like they should and then we have this other guy saying I'm not even worthy to look up to heaven I'm going to look down at the ground from where I came I tell you Jesus is speaking this man went down to his house Justified the man that smote himself in the chest the man that said Lord I'm a sinner rather than the other for everyone that exalteth him s shall be abased and he that humble himself shall be exalted look at the difference between the two men one man had far more sin in his life yet he was justified you know you know what Justified means Justified doesn't mean forgiven of your sins Justified means that that sin wasn't even there you didn't even do it I can for if brother Aaron does me wrong I can forgive him for doing that but in my mind I always remember that brother Aaron did me wrong when he is Justified brother Aaron didn't do anything wrong and that's how this man this sinner man came he came lowly and he left Justified completely cleansed the other man didn't now that was a story Jesus tells now I want to tell you real quick about an amazing coincidence when I had on my heart to minister on these two stories which is the Rick Rich Young Ruler and this that I just told this Parable that I just told I had him in my my mind and I looked and I said oh they're in the same chapter amazing so I looked and and there was the first part that I just read and then there were three verses and then it starts up in three verses later in verse 18 it's amazing to me brother Lionel that the three verses that I skipped were the three verses that I read for dedicating babies this morning verse number 18 and a certain rule ruler asked him now this is not a parable this happened in flesh and blood and a certain ruler asked him saying good Master what shall I do to inherit eternal life and Jesus Jesus said unto him why callest thou me good none is good save one that is God thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother he's quoting The Ten Commandments he's quoting the law of Moses which we'll hear more about tonight in The Book of Leviticus brother Lyall started it on Wednesday about the law now we're going to hear more tonight about this law and that's what he's quoting he says you know how to live right it's written in your Bible and the young man said this he said all these I have kept from my youth up when Jesus heard these things he said unto him now The Book of Mark I believe all the sna the gospels Matthew Mark and Luke all tell this story Mark says the same story and he says that Jesus looked at him and loved him this young man yet lackest thou one thing yeah you've done all these things you've lived a good life you you've been raised right you haven't sinned you haven't ran with wrong girls you haven't you haven't lied you haven't cheated you haven't done all these things you've honored your father and your mother but you're lacking something sell all that thou Hast and distribute unto the poor and thou shalt have Tre Treasures in Heaven and come follow me and when he heard this he was very sorrowful for he was very rich and when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful he said how hardly shall they that receive that have riches enter into the kingdom of God this young man we don't even know his name but what a what a very sad story that's in the Bible is this young man came to Jesus in another place it says that he bowed down a knee he bowed on his knee before him and he said what must I do to inherit this Kingdom Jesus loved him and Jesus looked and in the love that God has he looked and he saw that you have something wrong you have a vice there's something in your life that's going to keep you out of Heaven one thing let me tell you who this young man was this young man was well respected in his church he was a very giving person if he was in our congregation today this young man would want to be one of the most highly respected people in this congregation and yet he lifted up his eyes in Hell asking that Abraham would send this beggar to witness to his brothers one sin one Vice that this young man had he coveted his money and Jesus saw he saw the long term you know the the Rich Young Ruler probably looked at at these disciples said I don't want to be like them they're poor I don't want to be like this Lazarus over here this beggar he's poor if I sell everything then what I have imagine what he gave up right there he would have been probably numbered with one of the disciples we don't even know his name but we have these disciples they were they became the greatest people on Earth and here is this man Jesus looks down on him and loves him and sees that he is going to make the wrong decision because of one thing one Vice that this young man had and it doesn't even seem like it's that big of a deal but it sent him to hell when I was a kid um watched this movie it messed me up um it was called it was a it was back then it was a cartoon it's called Lord of the Rings everybody's heard about it written by I believe as a Christian Author I read the books in school and there was this character in that movie and I know there's there's more modern versions of it creepy little guy and he had his vice was a ring and everything in his life centered around this ring and he coveted it and he loved this ring so much that he called it his precious one thing tormented that being and ruined his life and here we have this Rich Young Ruler and he's coveting this thing and I look out at this audience and how many of us have something in our lives or or other things that we covet more than we covet the word of God and it'll ruin our lives one little thing oh it's not that big of a deal it is a big deal it may be money it may be the way you dress it may be drinking it doesn't have to be drugs and prostitution it may be pornography it may be lying and maybe running to mischief and getting in the gossip it could be anything that will send us to Hell one thing with this Rich Young Ruler it was one thing that sent him to hell and these disciples they're watching Jesus like whoow they see what an upstanding man this was I was talking with a friend of mine the other day I've known for 10 years called me and he was done wrong his in-laws came and and his wife ends up leaving him she she and she takes the kids and he would call me and he'd be weeping he saying I don't know where my kids are they could be sold into trafficking they could be anywhere he says I don't know they they've taken them and and not SP spoken to the man and he was just distraught for Years hated his in-laws and his wife for doing what they did to him talked to him two days ago I believe it was two or three days ago and he says tells me we've been reconciled my wife and I to a certain point said good and I hear his kids talking in the background and I said how about with the in-laws he tells me this he said they're going to die for what they've done God's going to punish them he was done wrong buddy you better not hope that how much more and here's what I said how much more have I done to God than anyone has ever done to me and the same for every person in here no one has ever done something in your life to you that outweighs what you have done to God in your sins the same for me so if somebody comes and does me wrong and I hold a grudge against them I very well could end up like this Rich Young Ruler in Hell looking up saying go tell the Tucson Tabernacle not to hold a grudge against someone because they'll end up in the same place one sin one Vice can send us to hell and all of us have them don't covet that everything is fine for me except for this one thing that I'm going to keep like the character in the movie each of us friends has a vice and we need to fully repent of our sins not just Lord I was wrong but I can't I just can't overcome this how many times have you heard that I just have this one trouble and Lord I I know I'm wrong but I just can't overcome it the Bible says that God will not tempt you above that you are able to overcome it above that you were able to bear so if this book says it I take it over your testimony or my testimony I just can't overcome that no no yes you can you just want it more than you want God I know that's harsh but it's the truth and here we have this Rich Young ru and the disciples are looking at him and they're like whoa this is this is big we know this guy he's like great Jesus says this for it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a through the needle's eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom and then the disciples heard it said and they said who who then can be saved all of us have sin in our lives and this guy probably has less than any of his disciples there and yet he himself said it's more precious to me than the word they heard it and they said who then can be saved and he said the things which are impossible with men are possible with God verse number I'll go ahead and read um the rest of it Peter said Lo we have left all and followed thee and he said unto them verily I say unto you that there is no man that hath left house or parents or Brethren or wife or children for the kingdom of God's sake who shall not receive manifold more in this present time and in the world to come Jesus is saying hey be encouraged because if you give up your Vice if you give up that thing that you want so bad that thing that's separating you from God if you give that up then God will replace it with something better something that's more precious than gold but you have to repent first and give everything to God that has to happen first before and the the problem with that Rich Young Ruler is he was too stubborn he knew he wanted a little praise there bowed on his knee before the prophet said all these things I've done check my check my past and Jesus loved the young man and he saw there was a vice there that was more important to him than anything else in the world and he ended up going to hell for it terrible terrible story so then you you think you say how can I you brother Daniel but we all have sins in our lives and we do I certainly am one of them I was praying the other day I felt felt bad because I do this sometimes I was on my knees and I was praying and my SmartWatch goes off and I'm in prayer seeking the Lord my watch goes off I'll just look now look read the message that came through right there brother Jordan right there the very first commandment that Thou shalt have no other gods before me I broke it I sinned right there I put the little Idol in front of God there I was in prayer what a shame I Comm I confess my sins before the church that's one of them don't want to tell all of them but it's a lesson I did wrong right there I could go to hell for putting something in front of God the very first commandment I look at Paul and I don't have time to read it but but Paul says he he's he's looking at himself and he says the things that I hate the most those things are the things that I do in Romans chapter 7 he says I I I hate it I preach against it and then I go do it and he says this he says oh Wretched Man that I am how terrible I am but look at the difference between Paul and that Rich Young Ruler there was repentance in Paul and Paul says this he says oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the Flesh of law of the law of sin he says this he says thanks be to God who delivers me through Jesus Christ Our Lord even though all of my sins are there I thank God that he does delivered me out there so what do we do what do we do with these sins and look at look at my life and now now we confess I look at my life and I see Peter and James and John in the book of Acts I say my life doesn't measure up to their lives and the Bible is is very careful to record sins of all the prophets and sins of these of many of these disciples but how come my life doesn't measure up to theirs where are these miracles we see Miracles we see blessings we see that God has done things for us but I read there should be more there should be more gospel there should be people should be flocking here to be healed to receive salvation Lord where do I fall short John chapter 3 there was a man named Nicodemus this man was not a normal guy he was at the top Bible says he was a Pharisee of Pharisees a teacher of the Pharisees he comes to the Lord Jesus came by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus the master says this how can a man be born when he is old can he enter into the the second time into his mother's womb and be born Jesus answered and said verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom he can't go there's there's different schools of thought about the water the water breaks and the child is born he he's born a flesh child there's there's many think that that think that that is coming into this world others think that it's in the baptismal pool up there that you have to be baptized but the second one is without dispute you have to be born again there has to be a new creat cre New Creation in you and a vice a sin will keep us from that whatever it is and friends we all have them as you sit here now look into your lives each one of us has it and are we willing like Paul was to say oh Wretched Man that I am I'm trying by the grace of Jesus Christ I'm going to keep trying I'm going to overcome it or are we like the Rich Young rulers like I think I'll go to another church I think I'll just forget about that part because it's not that important anyways in closing and uh musicians can come friends when I'm talking about these vices they they are what will keep you out of the Kingdom there are people in this room now that may be in the same place that that rich young ruler was that may be their destination it's a horrible thought but it's true the individual where am I going to end up you young men where are you going to end up you can't do it through your works if there is something in your life that is separating you from Jesus Christ get rid of it as best as you can confess it Lord I've got a problem Lord I need you to help me to overcome this and then overcome it I look and I see I see today it makes it's been bothering me so much that you think so highly of someone that that you have a friend or a or a colleague or or somebody in church and you lift them up so much and then you see they are fine up until one thing no the word says it well maybe that's not exactly true and they just Overlook it and it will end up taking them to torment into hell I'm not usually a fire and brimstone type teacher but but friends this will send us to hell if we don't get rid of every sin God will help us but if there is something in our lives get rid of it in my case there might be a lot of different things but I go before the Lord and I say Lord I'm sorry I'm a sinner oh wretched man than I am but I thank God for the blood of Jesus Christ that was shed on the cross and I want to do everything that I can but in the world today it says please yourself you're entitled we are not entitled to any anything a Christian forfeits all of our rights well he did me wrong so what I preached last week quot of the scripture you loan something to someone someone not your good friend you loan it to your enemy and then you hope that he doesn't bring it back so you can be blessed how many of us have that but instead somebody does something wrong to us a little thing and and says something bad maybe spreads a rumor about us and all of a sudden we want to condemn them and how much have I done to God how much have I done to God I remember one time somebody was spreading an awful rumor rumor about me I got down on my knees and I was praying I said Lord make this person's Folly manifest let the world see that what this person is saying about me is false put my head down I said Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this daily bread and forgive us of our trespasses oh God forgive [Music] me oh God forgive me as I forgive those that trespass against me what a hypocrite and how many of us have been in that situation no matter what we do we have no rights you have rights as an American but a Christian forfeits it that person that would do you wrong that would kill you you turn around as a Christian you pray for that person Stephen when he died when he was being stoned Lord forgive them for they know not what they do exactly almost the same words that the Lord Jesus said when he was on the cross Lord forgive them for they know not what they do and breaks my heart I see my failures everywhere but I see so many failures within the within the people that call themselves Christians are they really brothers and sisters are we Christians oh we believe the message we believe this there is no higher thing than to be Christlike a Christian are are we that what vices do you each have in your life are you willing are you willing to take it away to do your best to get rid of it to Forfeit everything and give your life to Christ because it says that I just read the scriptures that you will not enter into the kingdom as an adulterer as a murderer as a fornicator you can't we going to be like the Rich Young Ruler friends I can't say it enough all of us I know you're going to sin I know I'm going to sin I know I'm going to make mistakes but I'm going to repent and say I'm sorry I'm going to try not to do it again it's so important you young men you come here God bless you for what you're doing but don't forget you were born in sin and only Jesus Christ can take those sins [Music] away spread that gospel tell them tell the people about the Lord I look and I see where is where are the real Christians today are there any I look and I fall down I said Lord I'm not how much do I fail a wretched man than I am there was a Christian that lived 150 years ago he was living in a in a village in India and in that Village they were Head Hunters idolators evil people from England there came missionaries and told them about this man Jesus Christ what you're supposed to be doing traveled the world went over to this Village in India and told them about Christ and how you are to sacrifice everything for him converted this man converted his family he wouldn't go out anymore and Rob the other Villages and Rob the other tribes he says I'm not going to do it it's not the Christian way and everything that he had learned in growing up they said this is our way of life if we don't steal if we don't fight then we'll die we'll starve to death he said I'm not going to do it head hunting [Music] tribe they took the chief hears it uproar in the village the chief hears it he says to the man brings him before the people he says is this true you're not going to be living this life anymore you're not going to be living what you've been taught what you've grown up with you think you're better than us he says this he says I have decided to follow Jesus there's they said you are forsaking everything that you have learned you're hurting everybody around you and your new found belief you think you're better than everybody else what do you think you're doing he said the World Behind me the cross before me no turning [Music] back they placed his two boys a man had two sons we just dedicated precious two baby boys today he placed the chief brings the two young men sets them in front of him and he tells the men he said draw your bows he said will you Rec recant from this nonsense he says though none go with me though none go with me still I will follow no turning back shot the arrow threw his two sons killed them killed them [Music] both he says now will you recant he says my cross I'll carry till I see Jesus no turning back set his wife up there killed [Music] her then they set the man there has the people draw the bow and he says now will you recant you know what he says we know the song this is where the song comes from he says will you decide now to follow Jesus will you chief decide now to follow Jesus no turning back he gave it all and they killed him so what happened the man made such an impression upon that group of people these these missionaries came years later they came to India they came to this Village they're spreading the gospel they're te they're preaching Jesus Christ they come to this Village this Village says oh we already know Jesus we already know him the same Village the missionary said how do you know Jesus Christ and they told these missionaries the story of this man many years earlier that had given his life that was executed in front of the whole village and it made such an impression that from the village Chief they converted from Christianity the whole village because of this man's testimony and his strength in dying for what he believed how many people today will give up a little Vice refuse to give that up but he gave everything the things that he loved the most he gave everything for this Jesus [Music] Christ do you believe the Lord Jesus friends he is worth it don't end up like this rich Young Ruler where he lifted up his eyes in hell and cried out for them to go to his his brothers because it's standing there right before each of us and if we won't give it up as I said it could be anything it could be when somebody says something against you and you want to fight out don't pray for that person that's a Christian CHR somebody takes something of yours pray for that [Music] person that's a Christian that was this man that I just talked about and that is what the Lord Jesus wanted us to be that's what he wants missionaries to be as you're going out spreading this gospel live the gospel before him that's going to be more successful than anything that you ever say the song came from this man's testimony but the conversions came from his what he did in the life that he [Music] lived but give me Jesus yes take this whole world but give Give Me [Music] Jesus take this whole world but give me Jesus imagine him saying that in front of those people I won't turn back I'm not turning back I am not turning back for anything I won't turn back I'm keeping going in the
