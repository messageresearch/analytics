[8:05] for some reason that screen has gone

[8:08] me I don't I don't think it's the eyes I
[8:10] think it's the screen so then I have
[8:12] turn look this way and then kind of
[8:14] going back and forth but that's all
[8:16] right he's a lily of the valley
[8:19] show we have a a couple of requests to
[8:22] to Ring to your
[8:24] attention my daughter Sarah had
[8:27] requested prayer she's she's had a lot
[8:30] of fatigue and fighting a lot of mental
[8:32] battles at this time um
[8:36] she's the uh there where they where she
[8:38] goes to dialysis and all the
[8:41] uh the original doctors and the the
[8:44] manager of the place there chose to no
[8:47] longer take care of her so she had to to
[8:52] find some other doctors that would go
[8:54] with her and she did and she's but
[8:57] they're kind of starting all over again
[8:59] and they're asking all the same
[9:01] questions so it's been it's been a
[9:03] battle but we we had a long conversation
[9:06] the other night and she says I know in
[9:09] whom I have believed in and the the new
[9:12] doctor told her the other day well
[9:15] because this is going on 10 years now
[9:18] and then she even had to say you are a
[9:20] miracle there's no other explanation to
[9:22] that but as as physically we battle we
[9:27] have hard times so but we have a god
[9:30] that is more than
[9:31] able and um our
[9:34] sister Maria Ramirez had her pacemaker
[9:38] replaced today brother Tony sent a note
[9:41] saying that all went well but just to
[9:43] keep her in prayer is said that that
[9:45] everything establishes and
[9:47] then brother Daniel mentioned on the
[9:50] WhatsApp about my cousin's granddaughter
[9:53] named Scarlet she's 8 years
[9:56] old I saw a picture of her and she's
[9:59] he's my first cousin on my dad's side
[10:01] his dad was my my dad's brother and
[10:05] um I saw a picture when she was a little
[10:08] bit younger beautiful long hair just a
[10:10] smiley little girl with and and the
[10:13] picture at 8 years old she has no hair
[10:15] because of chemotherapy but she still
[10:17] had a smile when I saw the picture and I
[10:21] so I was keeping in
[10:23] touch and they found cancer in the bone
[10:27] in the arm and they're going to actually
[10:29] cut that portion out tomorrow and then
[10:32] take a portion of the bone from her leg
[10:34] and Transplant it into her arm and it's
[10:37] about a 16-hour
[10:39] procedure and so I told him we would be
[10:41] praying I let him know the church was
[10:43] already praying and he sent his his
[10:45] gratitude and his thank you
[10:47] so um to look at a little girl like that
[10:50] but she was smiling she didn't look down
[10:52] or hurt she there was a smile on her
[10:54] face and I said Lord every one of these
[10:57] children they they've never offended you
[10:59] they've not hurt you they've not done
[11:01] anything against you and and they're
[11:04] they're still confident that all is well

[11:09] came to him the same
[11:10] way and he said we would he would in
[11:13] know I turn I was just reading in John

[11:17] children so that's a promise we have and
[11:21] so we'll keep those in prayer and if you

[27:41] thank you so
[27:47] much
[27:49] tonight we'll be taking a look at the
[27:52] book we call numbers in Hebrew it's
[27:55] called bumed Bal in the
[27:58] desert Exodus was the story of Israel
[28:02] coming to Mount Si Leviticus was the
[28:06] story of Israel at Mount Si numbers is
[28:11] largely the story of Israel going from
[28:15] Mount
[28:16] Si it's a challenging study we see God
[28:20] getting frustrated with Moses and with
[28:23] the
[28:24] people we see the people getting
[28:27] frustrated with God and with Moses we
[28:31] see Moses getting frustrated with God
[28:35] and the people if we run a bit long
[28:38] tonight I hope you won't be frustrated
[28:40] with
[28:41] me let's invite the author to be with us
[28:46] once again and help us Lord Jesus we do
[28:50] claim those precious blood stains for
[28:52] healing Lord you said If any man lack
[28:54] wisdom to ask Lord we're looking looking
[28:57] for wisdom we're looking for insight
[28:59] we're looking for the life of this book
[29:03] through that blood to come to us Lord we
[29:06] desire to be conformed to your image we
[29:09] desire to be obedient we desire to be
[29:11] your children Lord that you love we
[29:13] desire to bring a smile to your face
[29:16] forgive us Lord where we fall short be
[29:18] with us this evening thank you Lord
[29:20] accept our praise our worship and be
[29:23] with us as we look into your word Jesus
[29:26] said that if they had known the words of
[29:27] Moses they would have known me and these
[29:30] are the words of Moses help us tonight
[29:32] Lord and we thank you in Jesus name
[29:38] amen we'll look to the gospels to set
[29:41] the stage for our study this evening one
[29:45] from a parable about an Unfaithful
[29:47] Steward and the other a prophecy about
[29:51] persecutions of witnesses for Christ
[29:54] Luke
[29:55] 12:47 he says and that servant which
[29:59] knew his Lord's will and prepared not
[30:03] himself neither did according do his
[30:05] will shall be beaten with many
[30:09] stripes but he that knew not and did
[30:13] commit things worthy of Stripes shall be
[30:14] beaten with few
[30:16] stripes for unto
[30:18] whomsoever much is given of him shall be
[30:22] much required and to whom men have
[30:25] committed much of him they will ask the
[30:27] more
[30:28] and going to John's gospel chapter 15:
[30:32] 22 Jesus
[30:33] said if I had not come and spoken unto
[30:38] them they had not had sin but now they
[30:42] have no covering for their
[30:45] sin we'll see a huge contrast between
[30:48] the relationship of
[30:50] God and the
[30:52] nation going to Mount Si that we saw in
[30:56] Exodus and Israel coming from Mount Si
[31:00] contain in the Book of Numbers please be
[31:04] seated The Book of Numbers consists of
[31:07] three parallel accounts three kinds of
[31:10] things are are going on here one is a
[31:14] kind of a travelogue it's telling where
[31:16] the nation traveled some of the things
[31:18] that happened along the way it's full of
[31:21] lessons for us to observe and take to
[31:25] heart I do mean full
[31:28] another is a census actually more than
[31:31] one of the people by their ancestry or
[31:33] tribe the last is additional laws that
[31:37] God gave at different times and I
[31:39] include this part where Moses tells the
[31:42] camp how to be arranged when how to
[31:44] March when they go to their Journeys and
[31:46] so forth perhaps those aren't actually
[31:47] laws but they're certainly
[31:50] instructions to add to the mix to the
[31:54] challenge the account is not
[31:56] chronological for example numbers 1:1
[31:59] takes place on the first day of the
[32:00] second month of the second year but
[32:02] numbers 91 nine chapters in takes place
[32:05] on the first day of the month of the
[32:07] second year two to four weeks earlier
[32:09] than the first verse of the first
[32:11] chapter so it's a little bit of a
[32:13] challenge you can't just sort of knot
[32:14] off and go to sleep please don't knot
[32:17] off and go to sleep we'll study tonight
[32:21] proceeding through the book digging in
[32:22] here and there as we
[32:26] go
[32:29] we'll be reading a lot a lot from the
[32:32] Bible makes sense after all this is a
[32:35] Bible study and I'm glad to see enough
[32:37] of you sitting up front I'm sorry I
[32:39] don't have any little tiny print Maps
[32:41] tonight but thank you for sitting up
[32:43] front remember what we're looking for
[32:46] we're looking for Jesus Christ of the
[32:48] New Testament as Jehovah god of the Old
[32:52] Testament keeping in mind our opening
[32:55] verses where Jesus expects us to grow
[32:58] and mature and take on responsibility
[33:02] will be reading
[33:04] Moses seeing
[33:06] Jesus Paul tells us pretty much the same
[33:09] thing in 1 Corinthians 13 He says when I
[33:11] was a child I spake as a child I
[33:14] understood as a child I thought as a
[33:17] child but when I grew up I put away
[33:21] childish things in Exodus Israel's a
[33:24] child but after Leviticus because here
[33:27] in numbers more is expected of Israel
[33:31] there are lessons for us too consider
[33:34] Paul's encouragement to Timothy in his
[33:36] very last letter second Timothy chapter
[33:40] 3 he says to Timothy and that from a
[33:43] child thou Hast known the holy
[33:45] scriptures the the very ones that we're
[33:48] studying tonight which are able to make
[33:51] thee wise unto salvation through faith
[33:54] which is in Jesus Christ all scripture
[33:58] is given by inspiration of God and is
[34:01] profitable for Doctrine for reproof for
[34:05] correction for instruction and
[34:09] righteousness why that the man of God
[34:14] may be perfect that means complete
[34:16] thoroughly furnished unto all good
[34:19] arguments and debates no to all good
[34:23] works with that background and guidance
[34:26] let's take a look at numbers Numbers
[34:28] Chapter 1 is a census of Israel's
[34:31] Warriors it comes out to 63,000 men aged
[34:34] 20 and up and plus Levites the tribe of
[34:37] Levi are not considered Warriors they're
[34:40] not part of that group but they numbered
[34:42] them from age one month and up all the
[34:45] male and there was a total of
[34:48] 22,300 of them this is a large group of
[34:52] people chapter 2 details the arrangement
[34:56] of the camp now the they've built the
[34:57] Tabernacle now those of you that are up
[34:59] front are happy you're up front I hope
[35:02] so this shows the Tabernacle in the
[35:04] middle the dark blue around them are the
[35:08] Levites and the mo and the uh priests
[35:11] and Moses and you notice there's a
[35:13] little L3 I put these L's and lzs and rs
[35:17] and stuff l means that Leia Leah was the
[35:20] mother of that tribe uh the R means that
[35:26] Rachel was the mother the LZ means that
[35:30] zilha Leah's slave was the mother and
[35:34] the RB means that bilha Rachel slave was
[35:38] the
[35:39] mother and and you'll notice here on the
[35:41] East the camp of Judah it's Judah
[35:45] isachar and Zebulon those are the fourth
[35:47] fifth and six Sons of Leah after them
[35:51] go uh these folks marari and gersan
[35:55] those are two of the three sons of Levi
[35:57] and they're the ones that carried the
[35:59] Tabernacle and the post and some of the
[36:00] stuff from the outside of the Tabernacle
[36:03] following them we have Ruben Simeon and
[36:06] God you'll notice that all of these are
[36:10] related to
[36:11] Leah and then finally we
[36:14] get Kath which are carrying the sacred
[36:17] items from within the Tabernacle they're
[36:20] Then followed by the ones that came from
[36:22] Rachel Ephraim and Manasseh I had them
[36:25] as r1a and B because they're descendants
[36:27] of Joseph and Benjamin and then finally
[36:30] is the camp of Dan and you notice that
[36:32] they are all children through the
[36:36] slaves and that's the order they March
[36:39] Judah marari and gersam then the camp of
[36:43] Ruben the south camp the rest of the
[36:45] Levites and the rest of the Tabernacles
[36:47] then the west camp Rachel's and finally
[36:51] the north
[36:52] camp and led from there so each of those
[36:57] four camps and marches in their birth
[36:59] order there won't be a test it's
[37:04] okay chapter 3 lists the sons of Aaron
[37:08] tells of the general duties of the
[37:09] Levites and describes the Redemption of
[37:12] the firstborn chapter four details the
[37:16] duties of the coites the gershonites and
[37:18] the meites the lines of the three sons
[37:20] of Levi and it tells us that for all of
[37:22] these groups and it list their their
[37:24] jobs that they start to work at age 30
[37:27] and they retire at age
[37:29] 50 uh so people say well there's no
[37:32] retirement in the Bible well there is
[37:33] for
[37:35] Levites in chapter 5 are laws regarding
[37:40] unclean people confession and
[37:42] restitution and a test for adultery
[37:45] chapter 6 tells about the Nazarite vow
[37:48] and Aaron's blessing we often hear about
[37:51] the Nazarite vow uh Samson is probably
[37:55] one of the most familiar characters in
[37:57] the Bible that is involved with that the
[38:00] intent of a person taking this vow is
[38:02] one of total separation of that person
[38:05] to God for a period of time and don't
[38:09] confuse Nazarite a vow of Separation
[38:12] with Nazarene which is a person from
[38:15] Nazareth today in Hebrew uh Christians
[38:19] are called not which is the Hebrew way
[38:21] of saying
[38:24] nazarenes and and then there's the
[38:27] blessing of the high
[38:31] priest did I go one too
[38:37] far I was supposed to have deleted those
[38:40] I'm sorry here we go the Lord spake unto
[38:42] Moses saying Speak unto Aaron and unto
[38:46] his sons saying on this wise ye shall
[38:50] bless the children of Israel saying unto
[38:53] them the Lord bless thee and keep keep
[38:56] Thee the Lord make his face shine upon
[39:00] thee and be gracious unto thee the Lord
[39:03] lift up his countenance upon thee and
[39:06] give thee
[39:07] peace and they shall put my name upon
[39:10] the children of Israel and I will bless
[39:14] them verse 27 here describes what
[39:16] happened last Sunday morning dedicating
[39:19] young children and babies to the
[39:22] Lord chapter 7 list the offerings of the
[39:26] the Tabernacle congre at the time of the
[39:29] Tabernacle consecration when is
[39:31] completed this takes place on the first
[39:33] day of the first month of the second
[39:34] year according to Exodus chapter
[39:37] 40 chapter 8 discusses some things in in
[39:41] inside the Tabernacle the seven lamps
[39:43] discusses the cleansing of the Levites
[39:45] getting them ready to serve into the
[39:47] Tabernacle and it talks about the
[39:49] retirement of the Levites but here is a
[39:52] little interesting thing that it says
[39:54] that the ages are 25 to 30
[39:57] 25 to 50 not 25 to 30 so the way I
[40:01] looked at that was at age 25 to 30 is
[40:03] like an apprenticeship then age 30 when
[40:05] they're carrying this Stu then they
[40:07] become Journey
[40:09] men okay that didn't go over very well I
[40:13] don't do that again okay up until here
[40:15] we're still at Mount
[40:17] Si in chapter nine the Passover is
[40:20] celebrated the 14th day of the first
[40:22] month of the second year after leaving
[40:24] Egypt chapter 10
[40:26] the last items to be manufactured for
[40:28] the journey are two silver
[40:33] trumpets as soon as a Passover ends the
[40:36] tent is packed the congregation moves
[40:38] out on the 20th day of the second month
[40:41] of the second
[40:43] year there's a definite order of the
[40:45] camp and we just discussed that but we
[40:48] see here that God is a god of order
[40:52] speaking of how worship should be
[40:53] conducted in the church Paul tells us in
[40:55] 1 Corinthians Ians 14 let all things be
[40:58] done decently and in order and telling
[41:02] Titus in chapter 1 he tells cus this is
[41:06] the reason I left you in cre that you
[41:08] should set in order the things that are
[41:10] wanting and ordain elders and every city
[41:12] is I had appointed
[41:16] thee well they go three days
[41:19] journey and then we begin chapter
[41:22] 11 recall in Exodus after crossing the
[41:26] red see the the last verse in Exodus 14
[41:28] tells us that the people believed the
[41:30] Lord and they believed his servant
[41:33] Moses only three days later after
[41:36] they've crossed the Red Sea they've sung
[41:37] a song of Celebration they walk for
[41:39] three days and they come to a place in
[41:41] the waters
[41:42] bitter and the Lord that they believed
[41:46] and Moses that they believed they start
[41:47] murmuring and
[41:49] complaining what are we gonna do what
[41:51] are we going to drink what you bring us
[41:52] here for don't you have a
[41:55] map but what happens they're murmuring
[41:57] and complaining the Lord chose Moses to
[42:00] throw something in the water heals the
[42:01] water they have good water to drink and
[42:03] everything's okay there's no
[42:05] repercussions if you
[42:07] will but Leviticus they read the law at
[42:10] SI and now numbers 11 3 days after
[42:14] packing up the Tabernacle three days
[42:18] journey
[42:22] it's sorry these were this is a
[42:25] different file then uh I I apologize
[42:30] numbers 11 verse1 when the people
[42:33] complained it displeased the Lord
[42:35] doesn't tell us what they complained
[42:37] about the Lord heard it we're told and
[42:40] his anger was
[42:42] kindled and the fire of the Lord burnt
[42:45] among them and consumed them that were
[42:48] in the uttermost parts of the
[42:52] camp and the people Cried unto Moses and
[42:55] Moses prayed un to the Lord and the fire
[42:57] was
[42:59] quenched but this didn't really seem to
[43:01] get their attention back in Exodus 16
[43:05] about a month after leaving Egypt they
[43:07] apparently ran out of food and
[43:09] complained that the Lord had led us into
[43:10] the Wilderness to starve God sent them
[43:13] Quail that evening and Mana started
[43:16] appearing the very next morning and
[43:18] would do so for the next 39
[43:21] years but in numbers after Mount Si
[43:25] numbers
[43:27] uh chapter
[43:31] 11 verse 4 and the mixed multitude that
[43:34] was among them fell austing and the
[43:37] children of Israel also wept again and
[43:39] said who shall give us flesh to eat we
[43:42] remember the fish which we did eat in
[43:45] Egypt freely the the cucumbers and the
[43:47] melons and and the leaks and the onions
[43:51] and the garlic but now our souls dried
[43:54] away there's nothing it all be because
[43:57] of this Mana before our
[44:00] eyes I'm tired of this plan for day
[44:04] after day meal after meal no seasoning
[44:07] to give it flavor there's no Variety in
[44:10] our diet I need
[44:12] [Music]
[44:14] prot skipping down to verse 18 the Lord
[44:17] tells
[44:19] Moses say thou unto the people sanctify
[44:23] yourselves against tomorrow you shall
[44:25] eat flesh for you have wept in the ears
[44:29] of the Lord saying who shall give us
[44:31] flesh to eat for it was well with us in
[44:35] Egypt therefore the Lord will give you
[44:38] flesh and you'll eat you'll not just eat
[44:41] one day or two days or 5 days or 10 days
[44:45] or 20
[44:50] days but even a whole month until it
[44:53] come out at your nostrils
[44:56] and it be lome unto you because that you
[45:00] have despised the Lord which is among
[45:02] you and have wept before him saying why
[45:05] did we come out of Egypt it wasn't
[45:08] because you were slaves it wasn't
[45:09] because Pharaoh was giving you hard time
[45:11] no okay no skipping down to verse
[45:14] 31 there went forth a wind from the Lord
[45:18] and brought quailes from the sea and let
[45:21] them fall by the camp as it were a Day's
[45:23] Journey on this side and a Day's Journey
[45:25] on that side how far you can walk in a
[45:27] day that's how wide this band of quailes
[45:29] was round about the camp and as it were
[45:33] two cubits high upon the face of the
[45:35] Earth three feet
[45:37] deep that's a lot of
[45:41] quail and the people stood up all that
[45:44] day and all that night and all the next
[45:49] day and they gathered the quailes he
[45:52] that gathered least gathered 10 rers you
[45:56] know how much that
[45:57] is 50
[46:00] bushels the least that a person gathered
[46:03] was 50 bushels 50 bushels 30 day one and
[46:06] two3 bushels of quail per
[46:09] day that's a lot and they spread them
[46:12] all abroad for themselves round about
[46:14] the camp to dry the meat to preserve
[46:18] it and while the flesh was yet between
[46:20] their teeth before it was chewed the
[46:24] Wrath of the Lord was kindled against
[46:27] the people and the Lord smote the people
[46:30] with a very great
[46:32] plague and he called the name of that
[46:34] place Kata atava because there they
[46:38] buried the people that lustered that
[46:40] means Graves of the
[46:43] longing in the first case going to SI
[46:46] God took care of them put up with their
[46:48] whining and the second one going from SI
[46:53] God dealt harshly to show them their
[46:55] foolishness
[46:56] lack of faith rather than being thankful
[46:59] for the miraculous provision in a desert
[47:02] Wilderness that people complained that
[47:05] it wasn't good enough there in the midst
[47:09] of a
[47:10] miracle what we commanded rather than
[47:13] complain Paul tells us in Philippians 4
[47:15] be careful be anxious for nothing but in
[47:18] everything by prayer and supplication
[47:21] petition with
[47:22] Thanksgiving let your requests be known
[47:25] unto God
[47:28] God in the verses we skipped in numbers
[47:31] 11 the Lord told Moses to gather 70
[47:34] leaders and the Lord will divide from
[47:36] the spirit of Moses unto them Moses was
[47:39] complaining about how hard his job was
[47:42] and this happens these 70 leaders come
[47:45] and they prophesy we see a parallel here
[47:48] where Jesus early on sent 70 disciples
[47:52] out to spread the gospel or in Pentecost
[47:56] where the spirit divides over the 120 in
[47:59] the upper
[48:00] room but two of the 70 in numbers didn't
[48:05] gather with the others but were
[48:06] elsewhere in the camp and they
[48:09] prophesied
[48:12] too let's pick this up for yet another
[48:15] parallel with the New Testament numbers
[48:18] 11:26 there remained two of the men
[48:21] whose names were on the list of TW of 70
[48:24] in the camp the name of the one was
[48:26] eldad the name of the other Maad and the
[48:29] spirit rested upon them and they were of
[48:32] them that were written but went not unto
[48:34] the Tabernacle even though they'd been
[48:35] directed to go there and they prophesied
[48:38] in the
[48:40] camp and there ran a young man and told
[48:44] Moses and said Moses Moses El dad and M
[48:47] dad they're prophesying in the
[48:50] camp and Joshua the son of nun the
[48:54] servant of Moses one of his young young
[48:55] man answered and said my Lord Moses
[48:58] forbid
[49:00] them Moses said unto him envest thou for
[49:05] my sake would God that all the Lord's
[49:07] people were prophets and that the Lord
[49:09] would put his Spirit upon
[49:11] them 70 is a good start we got another
[49:14] few hundred thousand out here that can
[49:16] handle a little help here too it reminds
[49:20] us of Jesus words to
[49:23] John in the Gospel of Luke we read Luke
[49:25] 9 and John no doubt looking for approval
[49:29] answered and said Master we saw one
[49:32] casting out devils in thy name we
[49:35] stopped him we forbat him because he
[49:37] didn't follow with us he's not part of
[49:39] our group he's not part of our little
[49:41] elected group in the corner over here
[49:43] he's one of those other people out there
[49:47] Jesus said unto him forbid him not he
[49:50] that's not against us is for us it's a
[49:54] good lesson for us as as well God is not
[49:57] limited to our
[49:59] group well in the very next chapter
[50:02] chapter 12 we read that moses' two
[50:05] siblings Aaron and Miriam they got upset
[50:08] with him I'll read this from the
[50:12] NIV has the Lord spoken only through
[50:15] Moses they Aaron and Miriam asked hasn't
[50:18] he also spoken through
[50:20] us and the Lord heard this verse four at
[50:25] once once the Lord said to Moses Aaron
[50:28] and Miriam come out to the tent of
[50:30] meeting all three of
[50:32] you so the three of them went
[50:35] out the Lord came down in a pillar of
[50:38] cloud he stood at the entrance to the
[50:40] tent and summoned Aaron and
[50:44] Miriam when the two of them stepped
[50:46] forward he said listen to my
[50:49] words when there's a prophet among you I
[50:51] the Lord reveal myself to them in
[50:54] Visions I speak to them in
[50:57] dreams but this is not true of my
[51:00] servant Moses he is faithful in all my
[51:03] house with him I speak face to face
[51:07] clearly not in riddles he sees the form
[51:11] of the
[51:12] Lord why then were you not afraid to
[51:16] speak against my servant
[51:20] Moses the anger of the Lord burned
[51:23] against
[51:24] them and he left
[51:27] them Miriam was stricken with Leprosy
[51:32] for seven
[51:33] days after which the encampment packed
[51:36] up and moved
[51:38] on chapter 13 opens with the
[51:41] congregation making their way to a
[51:43] mysterious location called Kadesh barnea
[51:45] I say mysterious because archaeologists
[51:48] and Bible
[51:49] scholars if you pick eight different
[51:51] maps and they aren't all published from
[51:53] the same company they'll have kades
[51:54] barnea and in eight different
[51:57] locations so this kades Baria we get
[52:00] that name from numbers 328 is in the
[52:02] wilderness of pan we get that from
[52:04] numbers 133 well there's 12 men that are
[52:07] sent once they get there Moses says I
[52:09] want 12 of you guys one from each trive
[52:12] go up this way go up through the South
[52:14] go spy out the land check it out what
[52:16] are we facing when we cross over there
[52:18] is it a good place is it a less good
[52:20] place bring us back the report let us
[52:22] know what's going on so they go out
[52:25] there to spy out the land and report
[52:26] back after 40 days they return numbers
[52:32] 13 and they returned from searching of
[52:34] the land after 40 days and they went and
[52:38] came to Moses and to Aaron and to all
[52:40] the congregation of the children of
[52:42] Israel unto the Wilderness of pan to
[52:44] Kadesh and brought back word unto them
[52:46] and unto all the congregation and and
[52:49] showed them the fruit of the
[52:51] land and they told him and said
[52:56] we came into the land where you sent us
[52:59] surely it flows with milk and honey and
[53:03] this is the fruit of
[53:05] it however nevertheless the people be
[53:09] strong that dwell in the land the cities
[53:12] are walled and very great moreover we
[53:15] saw the children of anch
[53:18] there the amalekites dwell in the land
[53:21] of the South the Hittites the jebusites
[53:24] and the amorites dwell in the mountains
[53:27] Canaanites dwell by the Sea and by the
[53:30] coast of
[53:32] Jordan people are starting to get a
[53:34] little unhappy here Caleb Steed the
[53:36] people before Moses and said let us go
[53:39] up at once and possess it we're well
[53:41] able to overcome
[53:46] it but the men that went up with them
[53:48] said we be not able to go up against the
[53:52] people they're stronger than we are and
[53:55] they brought up an evil report of the
[53:57] land which they had searched unto the
[54:00] children of
[54:06] Israel chapter
[54:08] 14 opens with the reaction of the people
[54:13] to this
[54:15] report and all the congregation lifted
[54:18] up their voice and cried the people wept
[54:23] that
[54:24] night and all the children of Israel
[54:27] murmured against Moses and against Aaron
[54:32] the whole congregation said unto them
[54:34] what God we had died in the land of
[54:37] Egypt or what God we had died in this
[54:41] Wilderness and wherefore hath the Lord
[54:44] brought us into this land to Fall by the
[54:47] sword our wives children should be a
[54:50] prey were it not better for us to return
[54:53] unto Egypt
[54:56] they said to one
[54:58] another let's make a captain and let's
[55:01] return into
[55:03] Egypt excuse me to go to Pharaoh the guy
[55:07] that sent his army to kill all of you 40
[55:08] years ago his sword these swords what's
[55:11] the difference oh maybe he let you be
[55:13] slaves again under cruel taskmasters
[55:15] that'd be fun what a brilliant
[55:20] idea then Moses and Aaron fell on their
[55:23] faces before all the assmbly of the
[55:25] congregation of the children of Israel
[55:27] and Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the
[55:30] son of jauna which were of them that
[55:33] searched the land rent their
[55:36] clothes and they spake unto all the
[55:39] company of the children of Israel saying
[55:41] the land which we pass through to search
[55:43] it it's an exceedingly good land if the
[55:46] Lord Delight in US he'll bring us into
[55:49] this land and give it us a land which
[55:51] flows with milk and honey only rebell ye
[55:54] not not against the Lord neither fear ye
[55:57] the people of the land they're but bread
[55:59] for us their defenses departed from them
[56:03] The Lord Is With
[56:05] Us fear them
[56:08] not the congregation's reaction was
[56:12] let's Stone these
[56:14] guys what's the lord's
[56:16] reaction the glory of the Lord appeared
[56:19] in the Tabernacle of the congregation
[56:21] before all the children of
[56:23] Israel and the lord said unto
[56:26] Moses how long will this people provoke
[56:31] me how long will it be before they
[56:33] believe me for all the signs which I
[56:36] have showed among
[56:38] them I will Smite them with the
[56:41] pestilence disinherit them and I'll make
[56:44] of thee a greater nation and mightier
[56:47] than
[56:51] they let's flash back to the people
[56:54] complaining in numbers 11 about flesh to
[56:57] eat we we skipped these verses
[56:59] earlier numbers 11 verse 10 then Moses
[57:04] heard the people weep throughout their
[57:06] families oh you what quail every man in
[57:10] the door of his tent and the anger of
[57:13] the Lord was kindled greatly Moses also
[57:17] was
[57:18] displeased Moses said to the Lord
[57:21] wherefore hast thou Afflicted thy
[57:23] servant
[57:25] wherefore have I not found favor in thy
[57:28] sight that thou layest the burden of
[57:30] this people on
[57:32] me have I conceived all this people have
[57:36] I begotten them that thou should as say
[57:38] unto me carry them in thy bosom as a
[57:41] nursing father beareth a sucking child
[57:43] unto the land which thou sawest unto
[57:46] their
[57:46] fathers once should I have flesh to give
[57:49] unto all this people for they weep unto
[57:51] me saying give us flesh that we may eat
[57:55] I'm not able to Bear all this people
[57:58] alone it's too heavy for me if thou deal
[58:02] thus with me kill me I pray thee out of
[58:04] hand if I found favor in thy sight let
[58:07] me not see my
[58:10] wretchedness Moses is one frustrated
[58:13] upset depressed individual but watch
[58:17] Moses here back in numbers 14 God said
[58:20] step aside he'll destroy them all and
[58:21] replace them with Moses descendants
[58:25] reading Moses seeing Jesus numbers
[58:31] 14:13 Moses said unto the
[58:34] Lord oh then the Egyptians will hear it
[58:37] for thou broughtest up this people in
[58:39] thy might from among them and and and
[58:41] and they will tell it to the inhabitants
[58:43] of this land for they have heard that
[58:45] the Lord that thou Lord art amongst this
[58:48] people that thou Lord art seen face to
[58:52] face and that thy Cloud standeth over
[58:54] them and that thou goest before them by
[58:58] day by daytime and a pillar of a cloud
[59:01] and in a pillar of Fire by night now if
[59:04] if if Thou shalt kill all this people as
[59:06] one man then the Nations which have
[59:08] heard the fame of thee will speak
[59:12] saying because the Lord was not able to
[59:15] bring this people into the land which he
[59:17] swear unto them therefore he hath slain
[59:21] them in the wilderness now I beseech
[59:24] thee let the power of my Lord be great
[59:27] according as thou has spoken saying back
[59:30] in Exodus 34 the Lord is longsuffering
[59:34] and of great Mercy forgiving iniquity
[59:36] and transgression and by no means
[59:39] clearing the guilty visiting the
[59:41] iniquity of the fathers upon the
[59:42] children unto the third and fourth
[59:44] generation pardon I beseech Thee the
[59:47] iniquity of this people according unto
[59:50] the greatness of thy mercy as thou has
[59:53] forgiven this people from Egypt even
[59:56] until
[59:57] now reading
[1:00:00] Moses seeing Jesus pleading for the
[1:00:05] people and the Lord said I have pardoned
[1:00:09] according to Thy
[1:00:10] word but as truly as I live all the
[1:00:14] Earth shall be filled with the glory of
[1:00:17] the
[1:00:18] Lord because all those men which have
[1:00:21] seen my glory and my Miracles which I
[1:00:24] did in Egypt and in the wilderness and
[1:00:27] have tempted me now these 10 times and
[1:00:31] have not hearkened to my voice 10 times
[1:00:33] how many plagues were in
[1:00:35] Egypt that's a
[1:00:37] clue
[1:00:39] 10 yeah just like Pharaoh 10 plagues 10
[1:00:43] rejections 10 testing t 10
[1:00:47] tempting surely they shall not see the
[1:00:50] land which I swear unto their fathers
[1:00:53] neither shall any of them that provoked
[1:00:56] me see
[1:00:57] it skipping to verse 26 the Lord spake
[1:01:00] unto Moses and unto Aaron saying how
[1:01:03] long shall I bear with this evil
[1:01:05] congregation which murmur against me I
[1:01:08] have heard the murmurings of the
[1:01:09] children of Israel which they murmur
[1:01:11] against
[1:01:12] me say unto them as truly as I live
[1:01:16] saith the Lord as ye have spoken in my
[1:01:20] ears so will I do to you I'm going to
[1:01:23] give you exact exactly what you asked
[1:01:25] for I heard you and I'm going to respond
[1:01:28] the way you asked me to that we would
[1:01:31] die in the wilderness right your
[1:01:33] carcasses that's a pretty blunt word
[1:01:36] your carcasses shall fall in this
[1:01:38] Wilderness and all that were numbered of
[1:01:40] you according to your whole number from
[1:01:42] 20 years old and upward which have
[1:01:44] murmured against me doubtless ye shall
[1:01:47] not come into the land concerning which
[1:01:49] I swear to make you dwell therein except
[1:01:52] Caleb the son of jauna and Joshua the
[1:01:56] son of
[1:01:57] nun but your little ones which you said
[1:02:00] would be a prey them will I bring in and
[1:02:04] they shall know the land which you have
[1:02:08] despised verse
[1:02:11] 35 I the Lord have said I will surely do
[1:02:14] it unto all this evil congregation that
[1:02:17] are gathered together against me in this
[1:02:19] Wilderness they shall be consumed and
[1:02:23] there they shall die
[1:02:26] wow and this next verse is a part that
[1:02:29] we often Overlook and the men the spies
[1:02:33] which Moses sent to search the land who
[1:02:35] returned and made all the congregation
[1:02:37] to murmur against him by bringing up a
[1:02:40] slander upon the land even those men
[1:02:42] that did bring up the evil report upon
[1:02:44] the land died by the plague before the
[1:02:49] Lord they were given special treatment
[1:02:52] but Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the
[1:02:56] son of jauno which were of the men that
[1:02:58] went to search the land lived still
[1:03:01] reminds me of a service recently we
[1:03:03] talked a little bit about not we but
[1:03:05] brother Daniel I believe was talked a
[1:03:07] little bit about from Solomon saying
[1:03:09] seven things that the Lord hates he that
[1:03:11] puts Discord among the Brethren these 10
[1:03:14] guys Discord amongst the whole
[1:03:17] congregation the next day the people say
[1:03:22] oops we're sorry we we'll go take the
[1:03:25] land now Moses told him not going to
[1:03:28] work guys it's too late God's pronounced
[1:03:30] judgment done deal but skipping to verse
[1:03:33] 44 but they presumed to go up unto the
[1:03:36] hilltop nevertheless the Ark of the
[1:03:38] Covenant of the Lord and Moses departed
[1:03:40] not out of the camp then the amalekites
[1:03:43] came down and the Canaanites which dwelt
[1:03:45] in that hill and smote them and
[1:03:47] discomforted them even unto
[1:03:51] Horna compare that back in Exodus 17
[1:03:54] before SI when they were attacked by
[1:03:56] amalec and defeated them now amalec
[1:04:02] defeats the tribe of
[1:04:05] Israel chapter 15 opens with laws about
[1:04:08] sacrifices laws about unintentional
[1:04:12] sins and then something
[1:04:15] happens let's flash back in our thinking
[1:04:17] to
[1:04:18] Exodus when Mana first appeared as food
[1:04:21] in Exodus 16 Moses told the people that
[1:04:24] on Friday they should gather a little
[1:04:25] extra and it wouldn't spoil the next day
[1:04:28] as it otherwise would on the Sabbath but
[1:04:32] don't go looking for it on the Sabbath
[1:04:34] because there won't be
[1:04:35] any but some of the people went out on
[1:04:38] the Sabbath
[1:04:40] anyway they came back empty-handed but
[1:04:43] there was no punishment for that
[1:04:45] Disobedience was before they had come to
[1:04:53] SI
[1:04:56] now in numbers after Mount
[1:05:04] Si I apologize here I had the
[1:05:10] wrong while the children of Israel were
[1:05:13] in the wilderness they found a man that
[1:05:15] gathered sticks upon the Sabbath
[1:05:18] day and they that found him Gathering
[1:05:20] sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron
[1:05:22] and unto all the congregation
[1:05:25] and they put him in Ward they they
[1:05:27] locked him up they secured him because
[1:05:29] it was not declared what should be done
[1:05:31] to
[1:05:32] him and the Lord said unto Moses The man
[1:05:36] shall surely be put to death all the
[1:05:39] congregation shall Stone him with stones
[1:05:42] outside the
[1:05:44] camp and all the congregation brought
[1:05:46] him outside the camp and stoned him with
[1:05:48] stones and he died as the Lord had
[1:05:53] commanded it's a different relationship
[1:05:56] here and now a new regulation then comes
[1:05:59] from the Lord to wear tassels on their
[1:06:01] garments he tells them it's a reminder
[1:06:04] to follow the Commandments not
[1:06:06] suggestions Commandments of the
[1:06:09] Lord I'm reminded of a story brother
[1:06:12] green sometimes told of his times with
[1:06:14] brother brandham he noticed brother
[1:06:15] brandham had a cross hanging from the
[1:06:17] rearview mirror of his car brother
[1:06:19] brandham told Brother green that it was
[1:06:21] to remind him of the Lord very much like
[1:06:24] the tassels here that we read about in
[1:06:28] Numbers chapter 16 details a rebellion
[1:06:32] led by a group of Levites whose leader
[1:06:35] was
[1:06:42] Kora
[1:06:44] oh I really apologize here
[1:06:53] because the PDF I think that's the one
[1:06:55] you want yeah the the
[1:06:58] PDF I I'm I apologize for all this
[1:07:02] I I won't go into the technical details
[1:07:04] but we are having technical
[1:07:08] difficulties please be
[1:07:10] patient fasten your seat
[1:07:19] belts it's numbers 16 verse1 is the
[1:07:23] slide I'd like to pick
[1:07:33] up I am normally better prepared thank
[1:07:36] you I
[1:07:38] was
[1:07:40] this was a different experience
[1:07:43] preparing for tonight and so up until 5
[1:07:46] o'clock this evening I was still putting
[1:07:48] things together which is my excuse for
[1:07:52] having this messed up thank you brother
[1:07:56] Jordan now Kora the son of ishar the son
[1:08:00] of Kath the son of Levi so he's a levite
[1:08:03] and he's and he's uh of the kath group
[1:08:06] the ones that carry the most important
[1:08:08] objects of the Tabernacle when they move
[1:08:10] and Dayan and abam the sons of elab and
[1:08:13] on the son of pel Sons of Reuben took
[1:08:16] men and they rose up before Moses with
[1:08:20] certain of the children of the
[1:08:21] congregation of Israel 250 princes of
[1:08:24] the assembly famous and the congregation
[1:08:27] well-known
[1:08:29] men and they gathered themselves
[1:08:32] together against Moses and against Aaron
[1:08:35] and said unto them you take too much
[1:08:38] upon you seeing all the congregation Are
[1:08:41] Holy they must not have remembered what
[1:08:43] happened with Aaron and Miriam every one
[1:08:46] of them and the Lord is among them
[1:08:49] wherefore then lift ye up yourselves
[1:08:51] above the congregation of the
[1:08:59] lord we see jealousy people dissatisfied
[1:09:03] with how things are going and seeing
[1:09:05] opportunity arguing that they're holy
[1:09:08] Sanctified by obedience to the
[1:09:10] law and their leader is the same Branch
[1:09:13] as Moses the line of Kath son of Levi
[1:09:16] there's
[1:09:17] 250 of these folks they Rebel God
[1:09:21] separates them destroys them of an
[1:09:23] earthquake it says that the Earth
[1:09:24] swallows them up a plague then breaks
[1:09:27] out and another
[1:09:30] 14,700 people perish it it take too long
[1:09:33] to go any further details about this
[1:09:35] tonight I encourage you to read this
[1:09:38] chapter in chapter 17 God has each tribe
[1:09:42] write their name on a rod with Aaron's
[1:09:45] name on the rod representing Levi the
[1:09:48] rods are placed in the
[1:09:50] Tabernacle and we find that in the
[1:09:52] morning Aaron Rod it came to pass that
[1:09:55] on the tomorrow Moses went into the
[1:09:57] Tabernacle of witness and behold the rod
[1:10:00] of Aaron for the house of Levi was
[1:10:02] budded brought forth Buds and bloomed
[1:10:05] blossoms and yielded
[1:10:10] almonds and Moses brought out all the
[1:10:12] rods from before the Lord unto all the
[1:10:14] children of Israel and they looked and
[1:10:16] took every man his
[1:10:18] rod and the Lord said unto Moses bring
[1:10:21] Aaron's Rod again before the testimony
[1:10:23] to be kept for a token against the
[1:10:25] rebels and thou shalt quite take away
[1:10:28] their murmurings from me that they die
[1:10:36] not doesn't blank but that's okay
[1:10:39] chapter 18 describes the duties of
[1:10:41] priests and Levites chapter 19 is about
[1:10:44] laws for
[1:10:46] purification chapter 20 opens with the
[1:10:48] death of
[1:10:50] Miriam we read that they came to Kadesh
[1:10:52] and Abode there there but there was no
[1:10:56] water let's flash back once again to
[1:10:58] Exodus just before they came to Mount Si
[1:11:01] they're in a desert Wilderness and
[1:11:03] there's no
[1:11:05] water and Moses Cried unto the Lord
[1:11:07] saying what shall I do unto this people
[1:11:09] they're almost ready to Stone me and the
[1:11:12] Lord said unto Moses go on before the
[1:11:15] people take with thee the Elders of
[1:11:18] Israel and thy rod that stick wherewith
[1:11:23] thou SM modus the Nile River and turned
[1:11:25] it into blood before Pharaoh take that
[1:11:28] in thine hand and go behold I will stand
[1:11:32] before thee there upon the rock in Horeb
[1:11:34] and thou shalt Smite The Rock and there
[1:11:37] shall come water out of it that the
[1:11:39] people may drink and Moses did so in the
[1:11:43] sight of all the Elders of Israel notice
[1:11:46] Moses was commanded to go to the rock
[1:11:48] with his staff and hit the rock in
[1:11:51] Exodus before Mount Si now here in
[1:11:54] numbers 20 after Mount Si they are again
[1:11:56] in a place there to Camp without a
[1:11:58] source of
[1:12:00] water let's
[1:12:01] read and the Lord spake unto Moses
[1:12:05] saying take the rod and gather thou the
[1:12:08] assembly together thou and Aaron thy
[1:12:11] brother and speak ye under the rock
[1:12:13] before their eyes and it shall give
[1:12:16] forth his water and thou shalt bring
[1:12:18] forth to them water out of the rock so
[1:12:21] Thou shalt give the congregation
[1:12:24] and their beasts
[1:12:27] drink and Moses took the rod from before
[1:12:30] the Lord as he commanded him and Moses
[1:12:34] and Aaron gathered the congregation
[1:12:37] together before the Rock and he said
[1:12:39] unto them here now ye Rebels must we
[1:12:43] fetch you water out of this rock and
[1:12:45] Moses lifted up his hand and with his
[1:12:47] Rod he smot The Rock
[1:12:50] twice he was told to speak this time not
[1:12:53] not strike and God honored Moses
[1:12:57] performed the miracle anyway as the
[1:13:00] water came out abundantly and the
[1:13:02] congregation drank and their beasts
[1:13:06] also and the Lord was displeased with
[1:13:10] her Disobedience and spake unto Moses
[1:13:13] and Aaron because you believed you
[1:13:17] obeyed you believed me not to sanctify
[1:13:20] me in the eyes of the children of Israel
[1:13:24] therefore ye shall not bring this
[1:13:27] congregation into the land which I have
[1:13:29] given
[1:13:31] thee we see that
[1:13:34] disobedience is equated with
[1:13:38] unbelief in the Lord's
[1:13:40] eyes and both Moses and Aaron are denied
[1:13:45] entry to Canaan even though Moses is the
[1:13:49] one that hit the
[1:13:51] rock so there here at Kadesh there are
[1:13:54] conflicting views whether Israel
[1:13:56] remained in Kadesh for the next 37 years
[1:13:59] or that they went on unrecorded
[1:14:01] wandering this is based on chapter 33 in
[1:14:04] numbers which lists all the encampments
[1:14:06] of Israel God told Moses write a list of
[1:14:09] every stop you made they came to Kadesh
[1:14:12] one
[1:14:13] time it's about the third year and then
[1:14:17] about the final year we're 12 they're
[1:14:20] leaving Kadesh and they go around Edom
[1:14:22] so if if either they stayed there for 37
[1:14:25] years or they didn't but if they didn't
[1:14:27] Mo they must have not stopped because
[1:14:29] Moses didn't record any other stops but
[1:14:32] if they stayed water flowed from this
[1:14:35] rock for 37
[1:14:40] years so now we jump to the end of the
[1:14:43] Journeys in this chapter they asked
[1:14:45] permission of Edom to pass through pass
[1:14:48] through the land we'll pay for whatever
[1:14:50] we use Edom says no so they leave
[1:14:55] Kadesh they head to mount on the
[1:14:58] border of Edom Aaron dies There They
[1:15:00] Mourn for 30
[1:15:02] days in chapter 21 as they march on a
[1:15:06] southern Canaanite King named Hamas I
[1:15:10] mean aod attacks and takes captives
[1:15:14] sounds like October 7th
[1:15:17] 2023 Israel seeks revenge and asks the
[1:15:19] Lord to help them and they completely
[1:15:21] destroy them in their towns
[1:15:24] sounds like Gaza
[1:15:26] today well they continue on South
[1:15:28] towards modern elot to go around the
[1:15:31] territory of Edom this is in the
[1:15:33] opposite direction of their destination
[1:15:35] from Canaan they're supposed you know
[1:15:37] well we're supposed to be going north
[1:15:39] and heading across to the river and now
[1:15:41] you got us going south oh Moses get a
[1:15:46] map numbers 21 they journeyed from Mount
[1:15:50] by the way of the Red Sea so
[1:15:52] they're going all the way back down to
[1:15:55] what is modern day
[1:15:57] elot so they can go around the land of
[1:15:59] Edom and the soul of the people was much
[1:16:02] discouraged because of the way we headed
[1:16:05] south we're supposed to go north the
[1:16:07] people spake against God and against
[1:16:10] Moses wherefore have you brought us out
[1:16:13] of Egypt to die in the wilderness well
[1:16:16] God said you were all going to die out
[1:16:18] here didn't they for there is no bread
[1:16:20] neither is there any water and our soul
[1:16:23] loath us this light bread we hate this
[1:16:26] Mana we're sick and tired of it and the
[1:16:30] Lord was so happy when he heard that the
[1:16:32] Lord sent fiery serpents among the
[1:16:34] people and they bit the people and much
[1:16:38] people of Israel
[1:16:39] died therefore the people came to Moses
[1:16:43] and said we have sinned we have spoken
[1:16:46] against the Lord and and against the
[1:16:48] pray unto the Lord that he take away the
[1:16:51] the serpents from us notice the the
[1:16:54] people came and
[1:16:56] repented and recognized that Moses had
[1:16:58] to intercede for
[1:17:00] them who intercedes for us when we
[1:17:04] repent parallels Moses prayed for the
[1:17:09] people and the Lord said unto Moses make
[1:17:13] thee a fiery serpent set it upon a pole
[1:17:16] it shall come to pass that everyone that
[1:17:18] is bitten when he lookth upon it shall
[1:17:21] live and Moses made a serpent of brass
[1:17:24] put it upon a pole and it came to pass
[1:17:26] that if a serpent had bitten any man
[1:17:29] when he beheld The Serpent of brass he
[1:17:31] lived this is a symbol of modern
[1:17:35] medicine it's not in contradiction to
[1:17:38] the first commandment about having no
[1:17:40] graven images and so forth it may appear
[1:17:43] so says you're not to make an image and
[1:17:46] then worship it The Mercy Seat had two
[1:17:50] cherubim on the lid images of things of
[1:17:53] Heaven above numbers tells us that God
[1:17:56] spoke to Moses from between the cherubim
[1:17:58] but the cherubim were not objects of
[1:18:01] worship they were not idols and neither
[1:18:04] were the serpents God didn't say pray to
[1:18:07] them when you see them or offer them a
[1:18:09] sacrifice or worship them he just said
[1:18:11] in effect look
[1:18:14] up Jesus said in one of the most famous
[1:18:17] passages in all the gospels as he taught
[1:18:20] Nicodemus one evening I wonder maybe it
[1:18:24] was a Wednesday evening we read in John
[1:18:27] 3 as Moses lifted up The Serpent and the
[1:18:30] Wilderness even so must the son of man
[1:18:34] be lifted up reading Moses seeing Jesus
[1:18:39] that whosoever believeth in him should
[1:18:41] not perish but have eternal life for God
[1:18:44] so loved the world that he gave his only
[1:18:47] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[1:18:50] him should not perish but have
[1:18:53] everlasting life for God sent not his
[1:18:56] son into the world to condemn the world
[1:18:59] but that the world through him might be
[1:19:04] saved well they loop around Edom and
[1:19:07] start heading north again they seek
[1:19:09] Passage through the land of the amorites
[1:19:11] but king sihon attacks them instead they
[1:19:14] defeat him take his
[1:19:16] territory King Ang of Bashan is
[1:19:19] similarly destroyed and Israel occupied
[1:19:21] those lands as well
[1:19:24] chapter 22 opens with a very nervous guy
[1:19:27] named Balo he's king of Moab he sees the
[1:19:31] Israelites coming and realizes he
[1:19:32] doesn't have a chance of stopping them
[1:19:35] so he attempts to enlist the support of
[1:19:37] a prophet a fellow named balum who lives
[1:19:40] to the south in near Midian he wants him
[1:19:43] to curse Israel balum consults the Lord
[1:19:47] and as a result he refuses to go I'm not
[1:19:50] going with you guys I don't care what
[1:19:51] you give me Bayo tries to entice him
[1:19:55] again God tells balum go but only say
[1:19:58] what God wants him to
[1:20:00] say
[1:20:02] nevertheless God was angry with balum
[1:20:04] for going to Moab and and on the way the
[1:20:06] angel of the Lord tries to stop him
[1:20:09] balam's donkey sees the angel and tries
[1:20:11] to stop balum doesn't see the angel so
[1:20:13] he gets down and starts hitting the
[1:20:17] donkey the donkey then speaks I guess
[1:20:21] that stops him from hitting the
[1:20:24] donkey and then balum sees the angel he
[1:20:28] offers to return home oh I'll I'll head
[1:20:31] back I don't need to go but the angel
[1:20:32] says no no no go go go to Moab just only
[1:20:36] say what you're told to say baam finally
[1:20:39] arrives at Moab where bik scolds him for
[1:20:42] not coming
[1:20:43] sooner balum consistently says he will
[1:20:46] only say what the Lord tells him in
[1:20:49] chapter 23 balb offers sacrifices and
[1:20:52] speaks blessings on Israel much to the
[1:20:54] displeasure of BAC again B ask him to
[1:20:57] curse Israel and balam again blesses
[1:20:59] Israel instead and then in chapter
[1:21:04] 24 and when balum saw that it pleased
[1:21:08] the lord to bless Israel he went not as
[1:21:12] at other times to seek for enchantments
[1:21:14] but he set his face toward the
[1:21:18] Wilderness and balum lifted up his eyes
[1:21:21] and he saw Israel abiding in his tents
[1:21:24] according to their tribes and the spirit
[1:21:27] of God Came Upon him and he took up his
[1:21:31] Parable and said balum the son of beor
[1:21:34] hath said the man whose eyes are open
[1:21:38] hath said Heath said which heard the
[1:21:40] words of God which saw the vision of the
[1:21:43] almighty falling into a trance but
[1:21:46] having his eyes
[1:21:49] open how goodly are thy tents oh Jacob
[1:21:54] and thy Tabernacles oh
[1:21:56] Israel as the valleys are they spread
[1:21:59] forth as Gardens by the river's side as
[1:22:02] the Trees of Lian allows which the Lord
[1:22:04] hath
[1:22:05] planted as cedar trees beside the
[1:22:09] waters he shall pour the water out of
[1:22:12] his buckets and his seed shall be in
[1:22:14] many Waters his King shall be higher
[1:22:16] than a gag in his kingdom shall be
[1:22:20] exalted God brought him for for out of
[1:22:23] Egypt he hath as it were the strength of
[1:22:26] an unicorn he shall eat up the Nations
[1:22:29] his enemies he shall break their bones
[1:22:31] and Pierce them through with his arrows
[1:22:35] he couched he laid down as a lion and as
[1:22:38] a great lion who shall stir him up
[1:22:42] blessed is he that blesseth thee and
[1:22:44] cursed is he that curseth
[1:22:48] the the earlier part of that reads like
[1:22:50] a Psalm how beautiful ful are thy Tes
[1:22:54] the latter like Jacob's blessing to
[1:22:55] Judah about the lion and it ends just
[1:23:00] like God's promise to
[1:23:07] Abraham his fourth and final Oracle
[1:23:10] points to the coming of the
[1:23:14] Messiah I shall see him but not now I
[1:23:19] Shall Behold Him but not nigh there
[1:23:22] shall come a star out of Jacob and a
[1:23:27] scepter shall rise out of Israel and
[1:23:31] shall Smite the corners of Moab destroy
[1:23:33] all the children of sheth Edom shall be
[1:23:36] a possession sear shall also be
[1:23:38] possession for his enemies and Israel
[1:23:41] shall do valiantly out of Jacob shall
[1:23:44] come he that shall have dominion and
[1:23:47] shall destroy him that remaineth of the
[1:23:51] city balum heads for home bik is not
[1:23:59] happy reading
[1:24:01] Moses seeing Jesus in chapter 25 while
[1:24:05] encamped in the area many in the camp
[1:24:08] break out into rald rry and start
[1:24:10] worshiping local Gods worshiping Bal at
[1:24:13] this location called peor God tells
[1:24:16] Moses to kill those that worship Baal as
[1:24:20] he's giving the command at the door of
[1:24:22] the the Tabernacle one of the men of
[1:24:24] Israel brazenly takes a woman of Midian
[1:24:26] into his tent Finos grandson of Aaron
[1:24:30] kills the man and the woman right there
[1:24:33] and the Wrath of the Lord is turned away
[1:24:37] 24,000 are
[1:24:40] killed God tells Moses destroy Midian
[1:24:44] for this that'll happen in chapter 31
[1:24:48] chapter 26 is a census of the new
[1:24:51] generation chapter 27 there's a law
[1:24:53] regarding inheritance some ladies come
[1:24:56] and say our father died and didn't have
[1:24:58] a son and what happens to the
[1:25:00] inheritance and they said the rule was
[1:25:03] well if a man dies with no son then his
[1:25:06] daughters get the inheritance if he has
[1:25:08] no daughters and they go to his brothers
[1:25:10] and so forth it trickles it down it
[1:25:12] figures out this whole uh this whole uh
[1:25:15] inheritance this is in the days before
[1:25:16] death
[1:25:18] taxes okay God reminds Moses that he
[1:25:21] will die I not enter the land Moses
[1:25:25] asked God to not leave the people
[1:25:27] without a leader God tells him to have
[1:25:29] eler anoint Joshua to succeed Moses in a
[1:25:32] public ceremony which is then
[1:25:36] performed chapters 28 and 29 describe
[1:25:39] various offerings Chapter 30 gives rules
[1:25:44] concerning making
[1:25:46] vows in the next chapter chapter 31
[1:25:49] Moses sends an army of 12,000 to destroy
[1:25:53] Midian balum is killed in the
[1:25:56] attack they take the wealth of Midian
[1:25:59] and the
[1:26:00] livestock but they also take
[1:26:02] captives captives which include
[1:26:05] thousands actually tens of thousands of
[1:26:07] women which incites Moses anger since
[1:26:10] the men of Israel being taken with the
[1:26:12] medanite women was part of the problem
[1:26:14] back at peor well there's a compromise
[1:26:17] the items animals and people taken are
[1:26:20] divided up
[1:26:23] chapter 32 tells of the descendants of
[1:26:25] Reuben and God wanting to settle in the
[1:26:28] already conquered lands we don't need to
[1:26:30] cross Jordan we like this place they
[1:26:33] agree to help the rest of the
[1:26:35] congregation to send their armies to
[1:26:37] fight and to take the land of Canaan and
[1:26:40] they're told the well if you do that
[1:26:42] then you can come back and stay on this
[1:26:44] side of the Jordan so the terms are
[1:26:46] agreed upon in chapter 33 Moses is
[1:26:50] commanded to record the stops made in
[1:26:52] the journey from Egypt to the banks of
[1:26:54] the Jordan and reminded that they must
[1:26:57] drive out the
[1:26:59] inhabitants in chapter 34 the boundaries
[1:27:03] of the land are
[1:27:05] described if you take the time to dig
[1:27:07] into this you'll find the borders to the
[1:27:09] south in particular and to the north are
[1:27:12] kind of
[1:27:14] fuzzy keep in mind while we think of
[1:27:17] Nations as having borders that are neat
[1:27:19] lines drawn on a map and mostly
[1:27:22] respected in this era there were city
[1:27:25] states there were Empires the borders
[1:27:28] were not aligned on a map they didn't
[1:27:30] have good maps anyway but it was all
[1:27:32] fuzzy it depend if your army was
[1:27:34] successful then this was your border but
[1:27:36] if they pushed you back then it that
[1:27:38] became your border it was
[1:27:42] Fuzzy uh so there were boundaries that
[1:27:45] were fought and shifted all the time one
[1:27:47] little side note in there is it talks
[1:27:49] about part of the South border is the
[1:27:51] river of Egypt and a lot of people think
[1:27:53] well that's the
[1:27:55] Nile I I think it's not the Nile and why
[1:27:58] would you say that brother the L the
[1:28:00] river of Egypt because if the Nile river
[1:28:04] forms a border then when they were in
[1:28:06] Goan they were already in the promised
[1:28:08] land and Moses who was never going to go
[1:28:10] in the promised land when they crossed
[1:28:12] the Red Sea they were in the promised
[1:28:13] land nearly this whole
[1:28:15] time the Nile River would be a
[1:28:20] contradiction anyway that's just W your
[1:28:22] appetite you say well then what is it
[1:28:23] well I'll let you go look I I don't want
[1:28:26] to spoil it for
[1:28:28] you chapter 35 lists the cities for the
[1:28:32] Levites and makes provision for what are
[1:28:34] called Cities of Refuge this this is
[1:28:37] what we would think of a person's guilty
[1:28:39] of of of manslaughter or third deegree
[1:28:41] homicide in other words it's not
[1:28:43] premeditated it was an accident but
[1:28:45] somebody got killed the family was going
[1:28:47] to seek Vengeance for that guy that got
[1:28:50] killed so the guilty party can flee from
[1:28:51] the the Vengeance and if he runs faster
[1:28:54] than they do then he can go into one of
[1:28:56] these Cities of Refuge and he's safe
[1:28:58] they can't go after him there but it's
[1:29:00] only for accidental
[1:29:02] death numbers ends at chapter 36 with
[1:29:06] rules regarding marriage of female
[1:29:11] heirs so now at the end of numbers
[1:29:14] Israel is now in Moab they're ready to
[1:29:16] cross the Jordan River and move into the
[1:29:20] land of promise while in Moab Moses will
[1:29:24] rehearse their journey in his final
[1:29:26] writing known as the book of Deuteronomy
[1:29:29] which brother Daniel will present next
[1:29:31] Wednesday God
[1:29:33] willing you'll have noticed that I
[1:29:35] skipped over the census results and
[1:29:38] except for that first one in the various
[1:29:39] laws I wanted to emphasize the
[1:29:42] difference between the relationship of
[1:29:44] God with Israel based on faith and Grace
[1:29:48] as we found in the book of Exodus before
[1:29:50] Mount Si and contrast with the
[1:29:53] relationship that's based on Law and
[1:29:56] urance as Christians the law of God
[1:30:00] should be written in our hearts if the
[1:30:02] musicians would please come at this
[1:30:05] time and we have a high priest to whom
[1:30:09] we can come who need not offer
[1:30:10] sacrifices for himself but himself
[1:30:13] became our one and for all time
[1:30:17] sacrifice we'll close tonight with with
[1:30:20] this verse from the apostle Paul Hebrews
[1:30:23] 7 for the law made nothing perfect but
[1:30:27] the bringing in of a better hope did by
[1:30:30] the which we draw nigh unto
[1:30:34] God and the
[1:30:37] blessing the Lord bless
[1:30:39] thee and keep Thee the Lord make his
[1:30:44] face shine upon thee and be gracious
[1:30:47] unto thee the Lord lift up his
[1:30:49] countenance upon thee and give thee
[1:30:54] peace as brother Aaron comes to close
[1:30:57] the service let's sing the chorus of the
[1:30:59] song look and live not to a brass
[1:31:02] serpent on a pole but to the Christ that
[1:31:06] bought our freedom to serve
[1:31:11] him look look and
[1:31:14] live my brother
[1:31:17] live look to Jesus now and live
[1:31:23] is recorded in his word
[1:31:27] hallelujah it is only that you look and
[1:31:32] will look and
[1:31:37] will look to Jesus now and
[1:31:42] live it's recorded in his word
[1:31:47] hallelujah it is only that we look and
[1:31:51] live one more time look and
[1:31:55] live my brother
[1:31:57] live look to Jesus now and
[1:32:02] live it's recorded in his word
[1:32:07] hallelujah it is only that you look
[1:32:12] [Music]
[1:32:14] and you know God never wanted to deal
[1:32:17] with Israel through the
[1:32:20] law but but he gave them a law when they
[1:32:23] asked for a
[1:32:24] law and he told them this is what you
[1:32:26] want this is what you're going to
[1:32:29] get and and to to his bride today it's
[1:32:33] not by
[1:32:34] La but we try to make it law because for
[1:32:38] us it's easier we feel that if we do the
[1:32:40] law then we've achieved
[1:32:43] something but when you realize that it's
[1:32:46] his
[1:32:49] grace what can wash my sins away nothing
[1:32:53] but the
[1:32:55] blood he is able more than
[1:32:59] able to keep I'm I'm just I'm not sure s
[1:33:02] which song it is so but it he is able
[1:33:06] more than able to keep his promise to do
[1:33:09] what he
[1:33:10] said it's it's kind of like a
[1:33:13] child learning and we want them to learn
[1:33:17] but at the same time you don't want to
[1:33:19] let go of their hand because they will
[1:33:21] fall
[1:33:23] you know but there comes a time when you
[1:33:25] let go of their hand and they do
[1:33:28] learn and that's when you set your wings
[1:33:30] in Winds of faith and God says come on
[1:33:34] up you
[1:33:36] know and he just reminds you that every
[1:33:38] promise in the book is
[1:33:40] yours
[1:33:43] everything these were the songs that
[1:33:45] came to me as as each part came and I
[1:33:47] just realized God's word is true he is
[1:33:50] faithful he doesn't you know and if it
[1:33:54] depends on Works who does the right
[1:33:56] amount of Works who does the right Works
[1:33:59] what really pleases
[1:34:01] God so if you look to Jesus Christ and
[1:34:04] you live let
[1:34:05] stand
[1:34:07] amen let's do a couple of verses of what
[1:34:10] can wash away my
