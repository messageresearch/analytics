[24:15] [Music]
[24:17] brother robert chacon is asking for
[24:19] prayer
[24:20] he's got a doctor's appointment to
[24:23] to have his eyes examined so just
[24:25] praying and believing that all will be
[24:27] well
[24:29] he hasn't he hasn't missed on one of
[24:30] these yet brother robert
[24:32] he's not going to miss on this one
[24:33] either
[24:36] sorry brother robert i was just too busy
[24:37] today i didn't have time for you no he's
[24:40] a ever present
[24:41] never fails amen
[24:44] sister shirley moore i requested
[24:47] prayer for sister green and brother
[24:49] robert figueroa
[24:51] and um
[24:53] brother shelley mentioned last weekend
[24:55] sister green had tested positive
[24:59] for covid and
[25:01] she had been struggling some but
[25:03] sister karen had been out of town for a
[25:05] couple of days and when she got back
[25:08] she led sister green to the piano
[25:11] and sister giron got on piano and
[25:12] started playing the piano and sister
[25:13] green revived
[25:15] you know the gift that lies within you
[25:17] when you stirred up some
[25:19] it begins to encourage you and that's
[25:21] sister green's heart was
[25:24] singing and playing the piano so
[25:26] brother robert i spoke to him
[25:30] i believe it was
[25:32] a friday evening
[25:34] a good friend of ours who had attended
[25:36] brother robert figaro's church
[25:39] originally from california part of the
[25:42] group that came with us
[25:44] we heard the message
[25:47] and she has moved to tucson and
[25:51] her sister lupe
[25:53] and she had called my parents my dad
[25:56] answered and she told him i fell
[25:59] but she became incoherent my dad
[26:01] couldn't understand what she was saying
[26:02] and couldn't get through to her
[26:05] so
[26:07] she asked me to call brother robert and
[26:08] brother robert was able to find out that
[26:10] her grandson was there with her
[26:13] sister lupe has been a friend of ours
[26:16] for many years
[26:18] and she had fallen down
[26:20] but brother robert told me she's been
[26:22] having some possibility of problems with
[26:24] dementia now
[26:26] so she's not
[26:27] understanding some of the things going
[26:29] on
[26:31] sister lupi and brother john know me
[26:32] since i was a baby
[26:34] just a little child they're good friends
[26:35] with my parents so they've been good
[26:37] friends of ours
[26:38] sister lupe alvarez if we would remember
[26:40] her in prayer
[26:42] and brother sam marriott continue to
[26:44] remember the brother sam marriott and do
[26:46] you have a need
[26:48] i would love to be remembered today
[26:51] he knows but but
[26:52] one another we can we can let's stand
[26:56] brotherhead would you come up and
[26:59] take these needs
[27:02] he's a faithful god
[27:04] there is no shadow of turning
[27:08] there's no variance in him he's the same
[27:10] yesterday
[27:12] today and forever
[27:14] for some of those they could just be
[27:16] words sometimes
[27:18] not anything more than words because we
[27:21] see our failures
[27:23] come on up brotherhead
[27:25] we see our shortcomings of promises that
[27:28] we make and we can't keep
[27:30] but there is no shadow of turning to him
[27:32] there is no variance in him he keeps his
[27:34] word
[27:35] he's the unfailing god so you said you
[27:38] know i've raised my hand
[27:40] i've asked him and there doesn't seem to
[27:42] be an answer doesn't seem to be a
[27:43] resolve
[27:45] but he's got it in mind he's guarded to
[27:47] take care of us so let's just believe
[27:49] that and give him thanks too

[30:25] times have questioned
[30:28] certain
[30:29] circumstances
[30:31] things i could not understand
[30:37] many times in trials
[30:41] weakness blurs my vision
[30:44] and my frustration gets so out of hand
[30:50] well it's in i am reminded
[30:53] i've never been forsaken
[30:56] i've never had to stand the test alone
[31:02] as i look at all the victories the
[31:06] spirit rises up in me
[31:09] it's through the fire my weakness is
[31:12] made strong
[31:16] he'd never promised that the cross would
[31:19] not get heavy
[31:21] and the hill would not be hard to
[31:25] climb
[31:29] he'd
[31:30] [Music]
[31:31] our never
[31:32] without fighting but he said help would
[31:36] always come in
[31:38] time
[31:40] so remember when you're standing
[31:43] in the valley of decision
[31:46] and the adversary says giving
[31:52] just hold on
[31:55] our lord will show up
[31:58] and he will take you through the fire
[32:02] again
[32:06] i know within myself that i would surely
[32:10] perish but if i trust the hand of god
[32:14] he'll shield the flames again
[32:18] again
[32:22] he never promised that the cross would
[32:26] not get heavy and the hill would not be
[32:30] hard to climb
[32:34] he never offered
[32:37] our victories without fighting but he
[32:39] said help would always come in time
[32:45] so remember when you're standing
[32:48] in the valley of decision
[32:51] and the adversary says giving
[32:57] just hold on
[33:00] our lord will show up
[33:03] and he will take you through the fire
[33:06] again
[33:08] [Music]
[33:10] remember when you're standing in the
[33:13] valley of decision
[33:15] and the adversary says given
[33:21] just hold on
[33:24] our lord will show up
[33:27] and he will take you through the
[33:30] fire again
[33:32] [Music]
[33:43] when it gets bleak when it gets dark

[33:49] he's not worried
[33:50] he's not troubled but he can be touched
[33:53] by your feelings
[33:54] and says i'm going to go down
[33:57] and he personally comes down
[33:59] whether it's through your brother
[34:00] through your sister he still comes
[34:03] sometimes i say lord that's not how i
[34:05] wanted it
[34:07] but lord let me say lord however you
[34:08] want lord let me recognize and receive
[34:11] it amen

[40:52] lord i want you to have your way this
[40:54] morning
[40:55] we've already
[40:57] not sure if you are aware but i felt the
[40:59] presence of the lord already here
[41:01] you know a lot of times we say those
[41:03] things but
[41:04] it's saying it
[41:06] knowing that he's here
[41:08] it's not just a cliche it's not just
[41:10] something we say to take up space or
[41:12] time
[41:13] to fill a little void we have plenty to
[41:15] say this morning but i believe he's here
[41:16] this morning
[41:17] through the songs that had been sung
[41:19] through the words that brother aaron has
[41:21] spoken
[41:22] i believe god had us in the right
[41:24] channel for this weekend for what he's
[41:25] going to speak to us this morning
[41:27] but before we turn to him this morning
[41:29] let's just take our
[41:31] our knees to him in prayer father we bow
[41:33] faithfully before your throne of grace
[41:36] we thank you god that you're a high
[41:37] priest

[41:40] that we can touch you
[41:42] and lord that you can be touched by the
[41:44] feelings of our infirmities lord our
[41:46] difficulties the situations that we
[41:48] endure and face in life god those things

[42:22] words to speak and lord not only give us
[42:25] the words to speak but anoint our ears
[42:27] to hear lord may we just be lured like

[42:32] ears that can hear what the spirit is
[42:34] saying to the church

[42:38] and we're asking that you give us ears

[43:03] always an honor and a privilege to be at
[43:05] the tabernacle to
[43:06] to be with god special people good to
[43:08] see sister mary lee
[43:10] i see you've got some family members
[43:12] with you today i heard a lot about you
[43:14] now hopefully get to meet you after the
[43:16] service
[43:17] uh if you don't like the preaching just
[43:18] don't find me just move on and it'll be
[43:20] okay
[43:22] but we're here and we're glad to be back
[43:25] brother tim and the ministry team back
[43:27] home since their greetings i was
[43:29] conversing a little bit this morning
[43:30] brother andrew glover he sends his
[43:32] greetings
[43:33] so we we are known around the world the
[43:37] tabernacle here and you're highly loved
[43:39] and you know most of all god loves you
[43:41] and that's why he keeps sending minister
[43:43] after minister to come and be able to
[43:45] feed you in your time of season but this
[43:47] morning i want to speak to you on god's
[43:49] purpose will not be defeated
[43:52] and i want to give it a subtitle if i
[43:54] could the experience of the juniper tree
[43:57] so god's purpose i want you to
[44:00] understand this this morning as god's
[44:02] elect his purpose for your life will
[44:06] never be
[44:07] defeated
[44:09] but there's an experience that we all
[44:11] must face
[44:12] many times it leads us to a juniper tree
[44:14] so let's just look here in first kings
[44:17] in verse 18 or chapter 18 and verse 36.
[44:22] it says and it came to pass at the time
[44:24] of the offering of the evening sacrifice
[44:26] that elijah the prophet came near and he
[44:28] said lord god of abraham isaac and of
[44:30] israel let it be known this day that
[44:32] thou art god and israel and that i am
[44:34] thy servant and i have done all these
[44:37] things at thy word hear me o lord hear
[44:39] me that this people may know that thou
[44:41] art the lord god and the thou has turned
[44:44] their heart back again
[44:46] then the fire of the lord fell and
[44:47] consumed a burnt sacrifice in the wood
[44:49] and the stones and the dust and he
[44:51] licked up the water that was in the
[44:53] trench and when all the people saw it
[44:54] they fell on their faces
[44:56] and they said the lord he is god the
[44:59] lord he is god
[45:02] see elijah said unto them take the
[45:04] prophets of baal let not one of them
[45:07] escape and they took them and elijah
[45:09] brought them to the brook kishon and he
[45:11] slew them there let's go here in first
[45:14] kings 19 and verse 1.
[45:16] so we find elijah's having this great
[45:18] great experience a supernatural
[45:20] experience
[45:22] but shortly after that experience we
[45:24] find them and they have told jezebel all
[45:27] that elijah had done
[45:28] and with all how he had slain all the
[45:30] prophets with the sword then jezebel
[45:33] sent a messenger until elijah saying so
[45:35] let the gods do to me
[45:37] and more also if i make not thy life as
[45:40] a life or one of them by tomorrow about
[45:42] this time
[45:43] and when he saw that he arose and he
[45:45] went for his life and he came to
[45:46] beersheba which belongs to judah and he
[45:49] left his servant there but he himself on
[45:51] a day's journey into the wilderness and
[45:53] he came and sat down under the juniper
[45:55] tree and he requested for himself that
[45:57] he might die
[45:59] and he said it is enough now lord take
[46:01] my life for i am not better than my
[46:03] father's
[46:05] and as he lay and he slept under the
[46:06] juniper tree behold then an angel
[46:08] touched him and said unto him arise and
[46:10] eat
[46:11] and he looked and behold there was a
[46:13] cake bacon on coals and a cruise of
[46:15] water at his head and he did eat and
[46:17] drank and he laid down again and the
[46:19] angel of the lord came a second time and
[46:22] touched him and said arise and eat
[46:23] because the journey is too great
[46:26] for thee notice
[46:27] he came to a juniper tree but that was
[46:29] not the end of the journey
[46:32] it was only a stopping place
[46:36] and he arose and he did eat and he went
[46:38] in strength of the meat 40 days and 40
[46:41] nights unto horeb the mount of god god
[46:44] bless you can have your seats this
[46:45] morning again we're going to be speaking
[46:47] to you on god's purpose will not be
[46:49] defeated
[46:50] the experience
[46:52] of the juniper tree it's an experience
[46:56] and we find that many of us like elijah
[46:58] we have our mount carmel experiences
[47:01] we have our juniper tree experiences we
[47:04] have our desert wandering experiences no
[47:07] pun intended
[47:09] all of you have had a desert wandering
[47:11] experience here in tucson
[47:13] but thankfully we find ourselves after
[47:16] we leave the juniper tree we find
[47:18] ourselves in another mountain
[47:21] tucked away in a cave where the voice of
[47:22] god can speak expressly to us
[47:25] and brother battle will make this
[47:26] statement he says
[47:27] in the message what doest thou hear
[47:30] he says now pastors here knows and other
[47:32] ministers watch after the mount carmels
[47:35] you're going to have a juniper tree how
[47:38] many have ever witnessed that they've
[47:39] experienced brother aaron you know as a
[47:41] minister after you have a great service
[47:43] on a sunday and all of a sudden on
[47:44] monday whoo
[47:47] the bible tell us whenever a man has a
[47:49] blessing and a power god pours down
[47:52] it does something for you look out
[47:54] satan's on the track just remember the
[47:57] next day that monday after good day on
[48:00] sunday it's going to be a hard thing
[48:03] because it's going to he he's going to
[48:05] do everything that he can to knock that
[48:07] confidence out of you that the holy
[48:10] spirit instilled in you the day before
[48:12] so you have a great service on a sunday
[48:15] and all of a sudden here comes the devil
[48:16] on monday morning he don't even give you
[48:18] time to get out of bed
[48:20] you're laying there thought starts
[48:22] running through your head and doubts
[48:24] start flowing and fear and anxiety
[48:26] starts setting in and we find that
[48:28] that's what the devil does but and he's
[48:30] trying to do this to knock the
[48:32] confidence out of you that god just
[48:34] instilled into you
[48:36] let me just say this for you this
[48:37] morning when you don't have confidence
[48:39] in yourself god still has confidence in
[48:42] you
[48:43] not only does god have confidence in you
[48:45] but god has confidence in what he's
[48:47] placed inside of you before you were
[48:49] born before the foundation of the world
[48:52] god planted a seed term of life on the
[48:54] inside and god has confidence in that
[48:57] deposit he's got confidence in that seed
[49:00] he knows it's going to produce exactly
[49:02] what it said it would produce it's going
[49:04] to make you a believer it's going to
[49:06] make you an overcomer it's going to make
[49:08] you a devil defeater god knows that it
[49:11] when you don't have confidence in
[49:12] yourself because all you see is the
[49:14] adversary i want you to know this
[49:16] morning a tucson tabernacle god's got
[49:18] confidence in you this morning
[49:22] he's got confidence because he knows
[49:24] what he's placed on the inside of you
[49:27] see job noticed god told the devil
[49:30] have you considered my servant job
[49:33] see god had confidence in job
[49:36] no matter what he did no matter if he
[49:38] took his children no matter if he took
[49:40] his wealth no matter if he took his
[49:42] career away from him no matter if he
[49:44] made him a pauper on the street no
[49:46] matter if he turned his wife against him
[49:48] god had confidence that job would not
[49:51] deny
[49:52] and that same god has confidence in you
[49:54] this morning
[49:57] he has the same confidence but notice
[49:58] job had a relationship
[50:00] job had a fellowship and the brother the
[50:03] prophet of god would tell us in the
[50:04] fellowship by redemption he said job had
[50:06] only one way
[50:07] and that's through the fellowship
[50:09] through the shedding of the blood that
[50:10] he talked to god
[50:13] see he knowed that he was
[50:16] and god had confidence in job because he
[50:18] had fellowship with job
[50:21] and he said now may the branham
[50:23] tabernacle see that today the only way
[50:26] god can have confidence in you is not
[50:28] because you do something or that you
[50:30] have faith to do something but it's when
[50:32] you have fellowship
[50:35] when you have fellowship
[50:38] you find yourself at the weakest moment
[50:40] the darkest hour and you got no
[50:42] fellowship with god you find a many a
[50:44] man put a gun to their head and take
[50:46] their own life because they lack a
[50:48] fellowship with the author
[50:50] but a believer gets to that moment gets
[50:52] to a breaking point and yet when you
[50:54] can't seem to take another step he's
[50:56] there to see you through because why
[50:58] because you have a fellowship a
[51:00] relationship with him and because of
[51:03] this relationship you can have
[51:04] confidence that god will bring you
[51:06] through it
[51:08] see god placed a deposit on the inside
[51:10] of each of us here this morning
[51:12] and that deposit that he made will
[51:15] outlast anything that you face
[51:19] sister rachel that deposit that he made
[51:22] will outlast anything you face
[51:26] oh i hope this is his home this morning
[51:29] that deposit that god placed on the
[51:31] inside of you look it wasn't brother
[51:33] aaron that put that deposit there it
[51:35] wasn't your favorite preacher to put
[51:36] that deposit there let me just say it
[51:38] wasn't even brother branham to put that
[51:40] deposit there but god almighty put a
[51:43] deposit inside of you before the
[51:45] foundation of the world and no matter
[51:47] what you're going through no matter what
[51:49] you're facing in this life that deposit
[51:51] will hold you in your weakest moment
[51:56] see it's stronger than any demon power
[51:58] that's coming against you to destroy you
[52:00] deposit there will conquer any situation
[52:03] that's trying to conquer you
[52:05] see god has confidence in a deposit
[52:08] and he has confidence in you who he's
[52:11] made that deposit in
[52:13] oh i just love this this morning
[52:16] you know when you had that relationship
[52:18] though with god it let you know brother
[52:19] aaron
[52:21] that you've been predestinated to the
[52:23] adoption of sons
[52:25] i love how it says in ephesians 1 verse
[52:27] 5 having predestinated us unto the
[52:30] adoption of children by jesus christ
[52:33] notice you god is telling us over and
[52:36] over and over and he uses the apostle
[52:38] paul to tell you exactly who
[52:41] you
[52:41] are
[52:43] you're not just some joe blow off the
[52:45] street you're not just somebody just
[52:47] wandered in this church building this
[52:49] morning but no you're the hand-picked
[52:52] anointed elected of god called
[52:55] predestinated
[52:57] for what for the adoption of sons
[53:00] and that word adoption there it means
[53:02] the placing of a son
[53:05] placing him in a position of authority
[53:08] placing him in a position of power so
[53:11] that that son's name on the checkbook is
[53:14] just as good as a father's name
[53:18] and notice he says here having
[53:20] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[53:22] children by jesus christ to himself
[53:25] according to the good pleasure of his
[53:27] will
[53:28] it's a good pleasure
[53:30] that you've been adopted this morning
[53:32] he's placed you this morning to the
[53:35] praise of the glory of his grace wherein
[53:38] he has made us accepted in the beloved
[53:42] no there was a time when you wasn't
[53:43] accepted
[53:45] there was a time you may have been maybe
[53:46] in elementary school you felt like an
[53:48] outcast nobody wanted to be around you
[53:50] but the father has accepted you into the
[53:53] beloved
[53:54] oh i tell you no matter what you're
[53:57] facing have that realization that i've
[53:59] been accepted through all my past all my
[54:02] failures all my shame all my
[54:04] shortcomings yet he's accepted me the
[54:07] way that i am
[54:09] and it's going to change me
[54:11] verse 7 in whom we have redemption
[54:13] through his blood and forgiveness of
[54:15] sins according to the riches of his
[54:17] grace wherein he hath abounded toward us
[54:20] in all wisdom and prudence
[54:22] having made known unto us the mystery of
[54:25] his will
[54:28] according to his good pleasure with his
[54:29] purpose in himself that in the
[54:31] dispensation of the fullness of times
[54:34] that he might gather together all
[54:37] are one and all things in christ both
[54:39] which are in heaven and which are on
[54:41] earth and even in him
[54:42] in whom also we have obtained an
[54:45] inheritance
[54:46] being
[54:47] predestinated
[54:49] according to the purpose
[54:52] predestinated according to
[54:56] the purpose
[54:58] of him who worketh all things
[55:00] after the council of his will
[55:03] god's purpose for your life will never
[55:07] be
[55:08] defeated
[55:09] because you have been predestinated
[55:13] unto his purpose
[55:15] so no matter what you're facing
[55:17] it serves a purpose
[55:19] no matter what you're going through it
[55:21] has a purpose no matter the sickness it
[55:23] has a purpose no matter the trial it has
[55:26] a purpose no matter the weakest moment
[55:28] it has a purpose
[55:31] and you've been
[55:32] predestinated to the purpose of his will
[55:36] and notice now church we are now adopted
[55:39] sons not will be tomorrow
[55:42] do you know what it means to be a son of
[55:44] god
[55:45] i got sisters saying amen and the
[55:48] brothers are they're just not saying
[55:49] anything at all
[55:52] i'm just kidding
[55:53] but to be a son means that your name on
[55:56] the checkbook is just as good of the
[55:57] father's now i got a son he's a big
[56:00] strapping young man 16 years old i had
[56:02] to look up to him a little bit he's
[56:04] about 100 well not 100 he's probably 50
[56:06] pounds heavier than i am it used to be
[56:08] he was like this and i could
[56:10] run him on my back here and there and
[56:12] play with him and get my bluff in now
[56:14] he's getting his bluff in
[56:17] but he's my son and you know if i'm in
[56:19] my study and i'm studying preparing for
[56:21] a service or whatever it may be you know
[56:24] your kids they don't knock on the door
[56:26] they just come right on in because why
[56:28] because of their position in the family
[56:31] so they can just barge on in interrupt
[56:33] whatever you're doing because why
[56:35] because they're sons and daughters of
[56:37] you and that's the same way it is with
[56:39] god we don't have to beg god to come
[56:41] down god already knows all you got to do
[56:43] is father i need you this morning i need
[56:46] the hand of god to come on my situation
[56:48] and because of your position as a son
[56:51] and daughter of god it brings god down
[56:53] to your need it brings god down to your
[56:56] sickness it brings god down into your
[56:58] trial into your furnace into your lion's
[57:01] den and he shuts the mouths of the lions
[57:03] and he stops the flames of the furnace
[57:05] why because your relationship your
[57:07] sonship with almighty god
[57:11] and we are right now
[57:13] sons of god
[57:15] recognize your position in the body
[57:18] i'm a son no matter how i'm how i feel
[57:20] no matter what i'm facing no matter what
[57:22] i'm going through no matter the sickness
[57:24] no matter the difficulty no matter my
[57:27] situation right now i'm an adopted son
[57:30] and daughter of god
[57:32] i've been placed in the family
[57:36] and notice right now we had the nature
[57:38] of god we possess the character of god
[57:41] our conduct matches out of the father
[57:43] we've been accepted in a beloved we have
[57:46] redemption through his blood we have
[57:48] forgiveness of sins he's made known to
[57:50] us the mystery of his will we have
[57:52] obtained an inheritance
[57:54] and we've been predestinated according
[57:56] to his purpose
[57:58] and there ain't one devil in hell
[58:01] there's not one devil one cancer
[58:04] one doubt
[58:05] one struggle one fear when anxiety can
[58:08] defeat the purpose of god
[58:12] notice brother brown will tell us
[58:14] it's your character your conduct that
[58:17] gives god confidence in you
[58:20] the way you act the way you respond to
[58:23] his word gives him confidence in you
[58:26] he says that's the reason that we
[58:28] haven't got great church or a great
[58:30] church marching on today is because god
[58:32] can't find people to put his confidence
[58:34] in the holy spirit keeps saying well
[58:37] they're tearing up here they're breaking
[58:38] up they're doing this they're up on the
[58:40] line he said stay with god's word that's
[58:43] god's truth that's the pattern that's
[58:45] the blueprint he said that's the reason
[58:47] the church today has got all kind of
[58:49] isms and everything in it and because
[58:51] they don't stay with god's word they
[58:54] won't listen to the holy spirit
[58:58] but i want you to know there's a bride
[58:59] in the land today
[59:01] there's a people in the land today that
[59:03] he does have confidence in
[59:06] that her conduct matches his her
[59:08] character pleases him she has the mind
[59:11] of god she has thus said the lord she
[59:14] knows what he wants done with the word
[59:15] or she keeps still and the prophet god
[59:18] will tell us she is flesh of his flesh
[59:20] she is born of his bone life of his life
[59:23] power of his power she is him
[59:29] and when you can recognize that you are
[59:31] him
[59:32] train a devil in hell can stop you then
[59:36] did you hear what i said
[59:39] when you recognize who you are she is
[59:42] him
[59:43] you can look at covet in the face and
[59:45] say you can't touch me
[59:47] you can look at cancer it may have
[59:49] brought you to your knees but you can
[59:51] look at cancers and you may destroy this
[59:53] life but you can't destroy the soul on
[59:55] the inside because one breath away from
[59:58] here i'm in a new body i'm in a well
[1:00:00] body i'm walking on streets made with
[1:00:02] gold let me tell you it don't matter
[1:00:04] what you try to do to me say you don't
[1:00:06] have enough this morning because i serve
[1:00:08] a great big god
[1:00:13] but see you got to be persistent you got
[1:00:15] to hold on and god's got confidence when
[1:00:16] he the healings may have lagged on a
[1:00:18] little bit he's got confidence you're
[1:00:19] going to hold on for the healing
[1:00:21] and after you make your confession stay
[1:00:23] with it don't back off
[1:00:25] you say god's healed you you stay with
[1:00:27] it until the manifestation comes you say
[1:00:29] god's given you the holy ghost and yet
[1:00:31] you're still doing things you stay with
[1:00:32] it until the manifestation comes take
[1:00:34] god at his word believe god when god
[1:00:36] remains solid be certain that he's god
[1:00:39] this morning
[1:00:40] when it seems like your prayers are
[1:00:41] hitting the top of the ceiling and it
[1:00:43] ain't penetrating into the heavens you
[1:00:45] keep holding on this morning because you
[1:00:46] got to be certain that god is who he
[1:00:48] says he is
[1:00:50] in the face of adversity you stand there
[1:00:52] believing in the face of sickness you
[1:00:54] stand there trusting you stand for
[1:00:56] righteousness you stand for holiness you
[1:00:58] stand for this message and the truth of
[1:01:00] this gospel
[1:01:02] you stand for god god will stand for you
[1:01:06] notice elijah had to stand
[1:01:09] he thought he was the only one
[1:01:11] what he didn't know there were seven
[1:01:13] thousand more
[1:01:14] but he stood in the face of a jezebel
[1:01:18] he stood in the face of a corrupt
[1:01:20] society jezebel then corrupted all
[1:01:22] society and got them going after her
[1:01:24] gods and many things of that nature and
[1:01:26] got all her priests around but yet the
[1:01:28] prophet of god will tell us because it
[1:01:30] was becoming to him in the midst of a
[1:01:32] trial in the midst of criticism in the
[1:01:35] midst of most indifference it was
[1:01:37] becoming to elijah a prophet to take a
[1:01:40] stand and stand there and i want you to
[1:01:43] know this morning it's the same
[1:01:44] situation with us in the midst of
[1:01:47] a a corrupt society when the world seems
[1:01:50] to be crashing down and politics are
[1:01:52] corrupt it's in time for the bride of
[1:01:54] christ to make her stand on the word of
[1:01:56] god
[1:01:59] make your stand
[1:02:01] don't be some wishy-washy this and
[1:02:03] wishy-washy that and changing your mind
[1:02:06] every so often matter no matter what the
[1:02:08] political winds blow here or blow there
[1:02:10] or let me just say the messages ideas
[1:02:12] blow here and blow there and doctrines
[1:02:14] blow here and blow there you stand on
[1:02:17] the resolute of this word
[1:02:19] you tie your experience into this
[1:02:21] message
[1:02:23] i'm telling you this message will carry
[1:02:24] you through this gospel will keep you in
[1:02:26] your weakest moment
[1:02:29] you know the in first peter we find that
[1:02:31] the bible would tell us beloved think it
[1:02:33] not strange
[1:02:35] concerning a fiery trial which is to try
[1:02:37] you as though some strange thing has
[1:02:39] happened to you
[1:02:40] many times we face a difficulty we think
[1:02:42] well what did i do to deserve this
[1:02:45] how many have ever been there i got a
[1:02:48] few smiles on your face it's okay to
[1:02:50] respond this morning you're not gonna
[1:02:51] scare me
[1:02:53] i don't mind an amen i don't mind a
[1:02:55] smile i'm not out of the head if that's
[1:02:57] all you can do it's okay
[1:02:59] just let me know you're with me this
[1:03:00] morning what we find in first peter 4
[1:03:04] and 12 beloved think it not strange
[1:03:06] concerning the fiery trial which is to
[1:03:08] try you as though some strange thing has
[1:03:11] happened to you
[1:03:13] see but rejoice in so much as you are
[1:03:15] partakers of christ's sufferings that
[1:03:17] when the glory shall be revealed you may
[1:03:19] be glad also with exceeding joy
[1:03:24] see there is nothing that happens to a
[1:03:26] believer or that a believer will endure
[1:03:29] but what god doesn't have an ultimate
[1:03:31] purpose behind it
[1:03:34] so that's why peter is saying don't
[1:03:35] think it's strange
[1:03:37] that you're going through this or you're
[1:03:38] facing this god has an ultimate purpose
[1:03:43] god has a plan in place
[1:03:45] and so god brought you to this
[1:03:48] moment
[1:03:49] so that he can display things that you
[1:03:51] didn't even know you had inside of you
[1:03:54] he's pulling character out of you you
[1:03:56] didn't know you had he's pulling fruits
[1:03:59] out of your life that you wondered is it
[1:04:01] there
[1:04:03] he's reaping rewards out of that deposit
[1:04:06] that he placed but only it's when his
[1:04:08] you face those fiery trials of
[1:04:10] affliction and james he would tell us my
[1:04:13] brethren counted all joy
[1:04:16] oh here we go again we can't even be
[1:04:18] down in the dump for one minute we gotta
[1:04:20] count it all joy
[1:04:22] sometimes how many of you felt that way
[1:04:24] sometimes preacher get up there and he
[1:04:25] tells you count it all joy count it all
[1:04:27] joy
[1:04:28] you're like will you just shut up
[1:04:31] i'm in the trial you're not i'm in the
[1:04:32] valley you're not you're not where i am
[1:04:34] you don't know how i feel
[1:04:36] but james tells us count it all joy why
[1:04:39] because it's working to the purpose and
[1:04:41] plan of god
[1:04:44] god brought you to account it all joy
[1:04:46] that god has confidence that not only
[1:04:48] did he bring you to it he's going to
[1:04:50] take you through it you can have
[1:04:52] confidence in the word of god this
[1:04:53] morning
[1:04:56] i know sometimes we don't like this type
[1:04:58] of preaching i want to be down in the
[1:05:00] dump i want to pet my little depression
[1:05:02] for a minute
[1:05:03] we've all been there we're human
[1:05:06] it's part of this life it's called a
[1:05:08] cycle
[1:05:10] but cycles are meant to be broken
[1:05:14] you know there's a cycle in my family
[1:05:17] and it just keeps going around and round
[1:05:18] and round but somebody had to make their
[1:05:20] mind up i'm to break that cycle
[1:05:22] i'm going to break that family curse
[1:05:25] because i'm going to become a part of a
[1:05:26] new family
[1:05:28] and that righteous blood that royal
[1:05:29] blood is going to begin to flow out
[1:05:31] through my life and begin to manifest
[1:05:33] himself and no matter what the trials
[1:05:36] that i face those trials have a purpose
[1:05:39] and god has allowed those trials that
[1:05:41] you endure the things that you're facing
[1:05:43] to mold you and to shape you
[1:05:46] you know god allows a satan to trouble
[1:05:48] you
[1:05:49] first to prove that you're not going to
[1:05:50] fall like the first pride fell
[1:05:52] and the second thing is to bring you
[1:05:54] into the image
[1:05:56] of himself
[1:05:58] think about michelangelo
[1:06:00] he had this picture in his mind
[1:06:05] a masterpiece but yet it wasn't a
[1:06:07] masterpiece yet
[1:06:09] but he sat there and he began to take
[1:06:11] this big piece of stone and chip away at
[1:06:13] it
[1:06:14] rub on it here and chip away here that's
[1:06:17] like it is in our life
[1:06:19] god comes and he rubs on you a little
[1:06:21] bit here or he brings another member in
[1:06:22] the church
[1:06:24] rub on you a little bit here oh getting
[1:06:26] quiet that's okay
[1:06:29] yeah
[1:06:30] got an amen out of some of you
[1:06:32] you know chip away a little bit here man
[1:06:34] chunks fall off and chunks fall off and
[1:06:37] you're doing good first but when you've
[1:06:38] been on that pew for a long time
[1:06:41] and michelangelo keeps coming back i can
[1:06:43] just see it
[1:06:44] that picture
[1:06:45] man i got to do a little bit more here
[1:06:48] and it begins to take maybe not so
[1:06:49] abrasive of a sandpaper and begin to
[1:06:52] polish
[1:06:54] see god has that same
[1:06:55] picture in mind
[1:06:57] we're looking more to that maybe a
[1:06:58] little bit this evening as we speak on
[1:07:00] what we're going to speak on this
[1:07:01] evening but we find that god allows
[1:07:03] these things to bring us
[1:07:05] into the picture that he has of himself
[1:07:08] see that's what god wants to do in this
[1:07:09] hour is to reproduce himself in a
[1:07:12] multi-memory body and how does he do
[1:07:15] that
[1:07:15] trials and tribulations
[1:07:18] buckle up
[1:07:20] because it's not a joyride
[1:07:23] sometimes you're going to question why
[1:07:24] me
[1:07:25] what did i do to deserve this
[1:07:28] come on we human this morning maybe some
[1:07:30] of you got your wings back there but you
[1:07:32] know i don't have wings yet i'm working
[1:07:34] on mine
[1:07:37] in the message the blushing prophet
[1:07:38] brother brown tells he said israel had
[1:07:40] its ups and downs it was the very type
[1:07:42] of the church of day how many have ever
[1:07:43] had your ups and downs
[1:07:45] all right i want every hand that goes up
[1:07:47] man it's a class participation brother
[1:07:49] arne's got both hands up in the back
[1:07:52] that's right we have ups and downs he
[1:07:55] says sometimes on the housetops next
[1:07:57] times are in the valley see that's what
[1:07:59] it takes to make us appreciate good
[1:08:02] things
[1:08:03] he says that's why they call it the law
[1:08:06] of contrast
[1:08:07] the black men of africa never know that
[1:08:10] he was black his skin until he seen
[1:08:12] david livingston
[1:08:15] see then he realized his skin was black
[1:08:18] because livingston was white it's a
[1:08:20] contrast you never know how to
[1:08:22] appreciate day if you didn't have a
[1:08:24] night
[1:08:26] you never know how to appreciate the
[1:08:27] sunshine if you didn't have a cloudy day
[1:08:29] you never know how to appreciate
[1:08:31] righteousness unless you had some
[1:08:32] unrighteousness you never know how to
[1:08:34] appreciate good health unless you've had
[1:08:37] foul health or bad health seed and
[1:08:39] that's the reason i think we all
[1:08:40] appreciate heaven so much it's because
[1:08:43] we lived here on earth
[1:08:47] see you know we don't enjoy and this is
[1:08:50] brother madam in his life story he says
[1:08:51] we don't enjoy the ups
[1:08:54] unless we have the downs
[1:08:57] see is that right did you realize we
[1:08:59] wouldn't have any mountains if we didn't
[1:09:01] have any valleys
[1:09:03] now we're here in tucson
[1:09:05] i would say we would consider this a
[1:09:07] valley
[1:09:08] you look all around there's mountains
[1:09:11] and for every mountaintop
[1:09:13] there's two valleys
[1:09:16] double the pleasure right
[1:09:19] for every mountaintop there's two
[1:09:21] valleys
[1:09:23] and the storms of life brother brown
[1:09:25] will tell us is what makes us
[1:09:27] have joy
[1:09:29] oh bless god here we go i can't wait
[1:09:32] till monday
[1:09:34] here comes the storms here comes my joy
[1:09:37] no
[1:09:38] but we find how many want victory in
[1:09:40] your life
[1:09:42] you really want victory you really want
[1:09:45] victory say it again amen
[1:09:47] all right well here you go before you
[1:09:48] can have a victory there has to be a
[1:09:50] battle
[1:09:50] oh brother joe that's a trick question
[1:09:54] he says before you can have victory
[1:09:56] there has to be a battle if there's no
[1:09:58] battles then there's no victories
[1:10:01] so we ought to be thankful watch how he
[1:10:03] phrases us we ought to be thankful for
[1:10:05] the battles and the tryings and it's god
[1:10:09] giving us the opportunity to have
[1:10:11] victories
[1:10:13] oh you just raised your hand i want a
[1:10:15] victory lord but get ready because he's
[1:10:17] going to send you through a battle
[1:10:21] he says don't that make you a little bit
[1:10:23] better now
[1:10:24] that battle come along somebody's saying
[1:10:26] something bad about you you got sickness
[1:10:28] come upon you maybe god give you those
[1:10:30] light afflictions that he might heal you
[1:10:32] and show you his favor to you let you
[1:10:35] see what it means what he means by that
[1:10:37] he loves you
[1:10:40] so god allows you to have battles
[1:10:43] those little light afflictions
[1:10:45] so that he can express himself to you in
[1:10:47] a greater way
[1:10:49] you're sitting back going why me
[1:10:51] what did i do look i've been done i've
[1:10:54] done this i've held true i've served god
[1:10:56] all my life i've not deviated from this
[1:10:58] message i'm not done and we got all
[1:11:00] these excuses
[1:11:02] but god is saying
[1:11:04] i got a victory for you
[1:11:07] i got a victory that's waiting on you
[1:11:10] but in order to reach that victory
[1:11:13] you got to go through the battle
[1:11:15] before our boys could win the battle of
[1:11:17] world war ii they had a storm the
[1:11:19] beaches of normandy
[1:11:21] and many lost their life but many
[1:11:23] prevailed
[1:11:25] what am i telling you many may lose
[1:11:27] their life but many are going to prevail
[1:11:29] we're going to storm the beaches and
[1:11:31] we're going to get the victory
[1:11:34] we're going to get the victory
[1:11:36] they were dead set determined brother
[1:11:38] aaron the allied forces were determined
[1:11:41] we can't lose this war
[1:11:44] we can't allow
[1:11:45] germany to conquer all of europe
[1:11:48] and anywhere else they want to go
[1:11:50] they had to stand against the tyrant and
[1:11:53] so do this bride body has to stand
[1:11:55] against this present-day tyrant
[1:11:58] we gotta storm the beaches
[1:12:01] god's brought you to the battle he's
[1:12:03] gonna bring you through it
[1:12:05] and the message we would see jesus
[1:12:08] notice how brother branham would say
[1:12:09] this he says why when we're brought in
[1:12:11] the presence of the lord jesus that is
[1:12:13] coming he said there'll be a million
[1:12:15] angels stand around the earth with bowed
[1:12:17] heads
[1:12:19] listening at the church sing songs of
[1:12:21] redemption
[1:12:22] not knowing what they're talking about
[1:12:25] when we're on the other side and the
[1:12:27] battle's been won and we get through
[1:12:29] there and we entered into the portals of
[1:12:30] heaven there's going to be millions of
[1:12:32] angels with their heads bound as you and
[1:12:35] i begin to sing songs of redemption and
[1:12:38] they don't have a clue what we're
[1:12:39] singing about because they never were
[1:12:41] lost but you and i had been lost and
[1:12:44] because we've been lost and god came
[1:12:46] down and redeemed us through the shed
[1:12:47] blood of his son we can sing about
[1:12:49] redemption we can sing about healing we
[1:12:52] can sing about deliverance we can sing
[1:12:54] about a miracle worker we can sing about
[1:12:56] a waymaker we can sing about an old time
[1:12:59] god who's never left you alone
[1:13:03] they don't know what we're singing about
[1:13:05] because they've never been lost
[1:13:07] they've never been sick
[1:13:09] they don't know how to rejoice over
[1:13:10] healing they don't know how to rejoice
[1:13:12] over deliverance
[1:13:15] oh but we do because it's a law of
[1:13:17] contrast
[1:13:20] see but everybody wants a hilltop
[1:13:23] experience
[1:13:26] can i get amen
[1:13:28] we love the mountaintops
[1:13:31] what's this mountain we've got over here
[1:13:32] mount lemmon
[1:13:34] how many lights going on top of mount
[1:13:35] leonard
[1:13:37] some of y'all
[1:13:39] some of y'all like me like i don't care
[1:13:42] no but we enjoy brother batman says
[1:13:45] everybody wants a hilltop experience
[1:13:48] let me go ahead and say you'd be lying
[1:13:50] right now in church if you said you
[1:13:52] didn't
[1:13:54] they never want to take to the valley
[1:13:58] because you know what's in the valley
[1:13:59] cactus
[1:14:02] sequoia is that the name of this cactus
[1:14:04] that grows here and every 50 years it
[1:14:05] puts out a new branch
[1:14:07] so or whatever sequoia saguaro i'm not
[1:14:10] from arizona obviously you know that by
[1:14:12] now this cactus grows an arm here and
[1:14:15] grows an arm here and sticks up here and
[1:14:17] it prickly prickly prickly don't go sit
[1:14:19] underneath that i think that's your
[1:14:21] juniper tree
[1:14:23] you'll be in for a rude awakening
[1:14:27] but we find everybody wants that hilltop
[1:14:29] experience you never never want to go to
[1:14:31] the valleys with everybody the
[1:14:33] pentecostal church every night
[1:14:36] every night you're not if you're not
[1:14:38] shouting dancing jumping up and down
[1:14:40] speaking in tongues and running all over
[1:14:42] the floor or something of another you
[1:14:43] didn't have any kind of meeting
[1:14:45] now let me just pause for a minute and
[1:14:47] say this don't use this quote to say you
[1:14:48] can't have an experience in church
[1:14:51] i'm not saying that at all i'm not
[1:14:53] saying we can't shout in church i'm not
[1:14:54] saying we shouldn't dance in church i'm
[1:14:56] saying the pentecostal people all they
[1:14:58] wanted was to shout all they wanted was
[1:15:00] to jump all they wanted was to dance
[1:15:02] they didn't want that word that was
[1:15:04] produced down in the valley that life
[1:15:05] coming out of them all they focused on
[1:15:07] was the emotionalism that his presence
[1:15:10] brought but i want more than the
[1:15:11] emotionalism i want the giver of the
[1:15:13] emotion i want the giver of life
[1:15:16] and how do you get that down in the
[1:15:18] valley where you learn to trust god for
[1:15:20] your need
[1:15:22] you learn to believe he says oh he goes
[1:15:24] well you know it's all right to be on a
[1:15:26] mountaintop that's good so there you go
[1:15:27] there's your met your prophet telling me
[1:15:29] it's okay to be on the mountaintop
[1:15:31] you get some people today that i got so
[1:15:32] intellectual brother aaron they don't
[1:15:34] want no kind of motion in the church
[1:15:36] they don't want no kind of jump in the
[1:15:37] church no kind of shout in the church
[1:15:39] the church sits dead
[1:15:41] dead is midnight and he says now but let
[1:15:43] me tell you your fruits will freeze up
[1:15:46] there
[1:15:47] when the cold spell comes you lose all
[1:15:49] your fruit he says that's what's
[1:15:51] happened now we put too much on mountain
[1:15:53] top experiences of dancing and shaking
[1:15:55] and jumping around instead of an
[1:15:57] all-night prayer meeting down in the
[1:15:58] valley a decision well you've come down
[1:16:01] there and you meet god and you really
[1:16:03] pour out your life until something takes
[1:16:06] place
[1:16:07] you know what we've all had been in the
[1:16:08] valley but it's okay to have that
[1:16:10] mountaintop experience but don't expect
[1:16:13] to live up there
[1:16:15] that's what the prophet of god was
[1:16:16] saying because of pentecostals and when
[1:16:18] you find the charismatics now and you
[1:16:20] find others all they want is that great
[1:16:23] emotional high that euphoria of of
[1:16:25] church or being in the presence of god
[1:16:27] but it's down in the valley
[1:16:29] because when you've been through the
[1:16:30] valley it makes you appreciate that
[1:16:32] mountaintop so much more
[1:16:35] my family and i took a trip to colorado
[1:16:37] a couple years ago and we visited pikes
[1:16:39] peak
[1:16:40] pike's peak is a little bit taller than
[1:16:42] mount lemon
[1:16:44] pike's peak is 14 115
[1:16:48] feet in the air
[1:16:50] and as we started we was in the valley
[1:16:53] and we started switch back in and my
[1:16:55] boy you start going up the mountain and
[1:16:57] you switch back this side and it's
[1:16:59] beautiful oh man
[1:17:01] nice scenery green
[1:17:03] not all dead and dry
[1:17:06] you're getting out of the valley where
[1:17:07] it's all dead and dry
[1:17:09] you know that desert place wilderness
[1:17:11] that you've been wandering in and you
[1:17:12] start switch backing back and forth in
[1:17:15] my you look through this ravine here and
[1:17:17] it's beautiful maybe you see some
[1:17:18] natural wildlife and you come back to
[1:17:20] this side and that's but the higher you
[1:17:22] go
[1:17:23] the less vegetation you find
[1:17:26] the higher you go the more rock
[1:17:28] that you find the higher you go oh yeah
[1:17:32] you're seeing
[1:17:33] miles and it's beautiful
[1:17:36] it's majestic god knew what he was doing
[1:17:39] god knew what he was doing when he put
[1:17:41] these things in his word about the
[1:17:43] valley and the mountaintops and about
[1:17:44] struggles because he knew there was
[1:17:46] going to be people who needed
[1:17:48] to switch back their way to the top of a
[1:17:50] mountain
[1:17:52] get a different perspective
[1:17:54] for a little while
[1:17:56] and got up on top of that mouth and we
[1:17:57] were up there and you know we were fine
[1:17:59] we're in a van we're driving up i'm not
[1:18:01] driving thankfully because the cliffs
[1:18:03] were right there
[1:18:04] you got people that know how to drive on
[1:18:06] these mountains and we'll get up to the
[1:18:07] top of it and you know beautiful scenery
[1:18:11] i mean you could just see for miles and
[1:18:13] miles and miles that you could see
[1:18:16] but for most of the tourists up there
[1:18:18] myself included especially my wife
[1:18:20] there's something that happened it's
[1:18:22] called altitude sickness
[1:18:25] you begin to get swimmy headed
[1:18:27] you can't hardly focus
[1:18:29] well why bro joe i thought the mountain
[1:18:31] time would be great grand and glorious
[1:18:33] it is
[1:18:34] but you're not meant to live up there
[1:18:37] you get altitude sickness she can't
[1:18:39] focus just right jessica had to sit down
[1:18:41] and she couldn't move from i couldn't
[1:18:43] really walk around and really enjoy the
[1:18:45] top of the mountain because of the
[1:18:47] effect of the oxygen the lack of oxygen
[1:18:49] and altitude and everything see but it's
[1:18:51] beautiful when you're on your way up
[1:18:54] you know something about a church
[1:18:55] service every church service
[1:18:58] has somebody who's on the mountain
[1:19:01] who's on the mountain this morning
[1:19:03] i don't expect to see every hand
[1:19:06] who's on their way down the mountain
[1:19:09] who's on our way up the mountain
[1:19:12] who's in the valley
[1:19:16] every service
[1:19:18] there's those type of believers
[1:19:20] there's those that are still in the
[1:19:21] valley there's those that are climbing
[1:19:23] the mountain there are those that at the
[1:19:25] top of the mountain then there's those
[1:19:27] that are descending from the mountain
[1:19:29] so what that tells me when we come to
[1:19:31] the house of god maybe i'm on my valley
[1:19:33] or in my valley i know there's somebody
[1:19:35] at the top of that mountain that's going
[1:19:36] to encourage me keep on climbing
[1:19:39] keep on climbing keep on climbing the
[1:19:41] view is amazing
[1:19:43] it's wonderful up here
[1:19:45] then you get through that mountain top
[1:19:47] and you start on your way down
[1:19:49] hold the brakes enjoy it while you can
[1:19:52] don't come off so quick
[1:19:54] see that's
[1:19:55] our spiritual mountaintops are much the
[1:19:57] same
[1:19:59] we're not meant to live up there we're
[1:20:01] not meant to exp we're just meant to
[1:20:03] experience for a short duration so that
[1:20:05] we can appreciate what we've been
[1:20:07] through the valley
[1:20:11] brown said now the real spirit-filled
[1:20:13] leaders
[1:20:14] real spirit-filled christians of the
[1:20:16] pentecostal move they recognize that
[1:20:19] something has happened
[1:20:21] they cooled off
[1:20:23] because everybody's trying to live on
[1:20:25] top of the mountain and they've gone off
[1:20:26] without god
[1:20:28] i want to enjoy my mountain
[1:20:31] want to enjoy my mountain but in order
[1:20:33] to enjoy my mountain i have to go
[1:20:36] through the valley
[1:20:39] but he's never
[1:20:41] left you alone
[1:20:43] no never
[1:20:45] left you alone brother brown says we got
[1:20:47] to have these pros and cons
[1:20:50] he says that's the way it goes you got
[1:20:52] to have good days to make you enjoy bad
[1:20:54] days to make you enjoy the good or bad
[1:20:56] days to make enjoy the good you have to
[1:20:58] have a little sickness to make you enjoy
[1:21:00] good health you have to have your
[1:21:02] valleys to make you enjoy the
[1:21:03] mountaintops
[1:21:06] and so then some of these days it will
[1:21:07] be all mountaintop it'll be all good
[1:21:10] health it'll be all god it'll be all joy
[1:21:13] but it'll be all unending joys but until
[1:21:16] that time we have to have pros and cons
[1:21:20] and for most of us here this morning
[1:21:22] there's a lot more cons in our life than
[1:21:24] there are pros
[1:21:26] we continually face hardships
[1:21:29] seems like we're always in a trial
[1:21:31] either we just came out of one we're
[1:21:32] going back into another one the bible
[1:21:34] would tell us that many are the
[1:21:35] afflictions of the righteous we get down
[1:21:38] we get depressed we get nervous we fret
[1:21:40] we face anxieties we face fears we have
[1:21:42] sicknesses we lose a loved one we deal
[1:21:44] with the loneliness that that brings we
[1:21:46] have disappointments this life is so
[1:21:48] full of the cons
[1:21:51] and it's refreshing church
[1:21:53] to have a mountaintop
[1:21:56] it's so refreshing when you've been
[1:21:58] through the ruggery or drudgery of the
[1:22:00] valley
[1:22:01] to get out of it
[1:22:03] take a size
[1:22:05] thank you lord you brought me through it
[1:22:08] thank you lord you brought me through it
[1:22:10] but you know it's a sad thing today that
[1:22:12] there's people and there's people even
[1:22:14] around this message they want to rob you
[1:22:16] from your mountaintop
[1:22:20] they want to steal
[1:22:22] the victory that god has just instilled
[1:22:24] in you
[1:22:26] they don't want you to they don't want
[1:22:28] you to have that outburst of emotion
[1:22:31] well you just need some church order
[1:22:38] you know we don't act like that in
[1:22:39] church well i don't know what tapes
[1:22:41] you're listening to that i'm not
[1:22:44] i just got to listen to be certain of
[1:22:45] god on the plane here you're staying at
[1:22:46] the very end of brother brown said the
[1:22:48] message is over now let's shout amen
[1:22:50] real loud amen
[1:22:53] well that's just uncalled for
[1:22:57] no he was an example
[1:22:59] but there's men around this message
[1:23:01] because why because they lack the gift
[1:23:03] of the holy ghost in their life they
[1:23:05] want to criticize you for why because of
[1:23:08] that outburst of emotion god just
[1:23:10] brought you through a valley let me tell
[1:23:12] you you don't know what god has just
[1:23:14] done for me you don't know when god's
[1:23:16] done something supernatural for you
[1:23:18] it'll make you shout it'll make you jump
[1:23:20] it'll make you dance we had a young
[1:23:22] sister in our church a couple of years
[1:23:23] ago she had stage four cancer
[1:23:26] and she jumped up out of her seat ran
[1:23:29] around the church two times why because
[1:23:31] god just spoke to her i'm your healer i
[1:23:34] take this cancer from you and you let
[1:23:36] somebody criticize that's uncalled for
[1:23:39] that's not like church order let me tell
[1:23:41] you you don't know what god just did for
[1:23:43] her
[1:23:45] and they want to steal your joy they
[1:23:47] want to steal your mountain's top they
[1:23:48] want to stop that shout they want to
[1:23:50] quench that hunger they want to shut
[1:23:52] down your dance because they want to say
[1:23:54] it's out of church order
[1:23:58] but said they need to get out of order
[1:24:00] so they can get saved
[1:24:02] and i'm not here to criticize that but
[1:24:04] we find people today
[1:24:05] they're so scared
[1:24:08] they're scared of the emotion
[1:24:11] they're scared of the realization it's
[1:24:13] okay to have a mountaintop
[1:24:16] it's okay to shout hallelujah it's okay
[1:24:19] to say glory to god it's okay to say
[1:24:22] amen it's okay to shout the house it's
[1:24:25] okay to dance in the spirit it's okay
[1:24:28] church
[1:24:29] because what are you doing you're
[1:24:30] reflecting himself back
[1:24:33] you're responding to his word you're
[1:24:35] responding to his healing you're
[1:24:36] responding to his deliverance you're
[1:24:38] responding to the mountaintop you're
[1:24:40] responding to your v-day
[1:24:43] when those boys got through there and
[1:24:44] they said the war was over there was
[1:24:47] shotgun fires and they were firing this
[1:24:49] and popping champagne and all this stuff
[1:24:51] they enjoyed that the war was over the
[1:24:54] battle is over that's the same way that
[1:24:56] we are
[1:24:59] enjoy your mountaintop
[1:25:01] enjoy that moment
[1:25:04] because it don't last long
[1:25:06] and when you find yourself in the valley
[1:25:09] you know what you need to do when you're
[1:25:10] in the valley
[1:25:13] when you're in the valley 2nd kings 3
[1:25:15] and 16 says make it full of ditches
[1:25:19] when you're in the vote oh brother joe

[1:25:27] place and i want you to start digging
[1:25:28] ditches well that's the most stupidest

[1:25:56] and your cattle and your beast and this
[1:25:58] is but a light thing in the sight of god
[1:26:00] and he will deliver the moabites also

[1:26:05] there and you start digging you got a
[1:26:07] prodigal son you got a prodigal daughter

[1:27:05] digging this ditch
[1:27:06] no matter if i'm at my weakest moment
[1:27:08] i'm digging this ditch i can't see god
[1:27:11] move on my son he seems like the more i
[1:27:14] pray the further he gets i'm digging
[1:27:16] that ditch anyway it doesn't matter
[1:27:17] they're going to return home because why
[1:27:19] because god gave the promise and god is
[1:27:22] obligated to his promise
[1:27:25] see elijah had some mountaintops
[1:27:28] we find in first kings 17 he called for
[1:27:31] it not to rain it didn't rain for three
[1:27:33] years go on down in second and first
[1:27:35] kings 17 we find that he went to a
[1:27:37] little widow's house and make me a cake
[1:27:39] first your cruise of all and the the
[1:27:41] mill barrel will not run dry it never
[1:27:43] ran dry until the rains came we finally
[1:27:45] went to another widow and he stretched
[1:27:47] himself over a dead child and the child
[1:27:49] came back to life and then we finally
[1:27:51] first kings 18 he defeated 400 province
[1:27:54] of bell and after the battle he went up
[1:27:56] to a mountain he says i hear the sound
[1:27:58] of abundance of rain and he saw the size
[1:28:00] of a man's hand and what was it he said
[1:28:02] ahab prepare the cherries and he outran
[1:28:04] the cherries home
[1:28:06] he was on a mountaintop and it seems
[1:28:08] like god was with him everything he said
[1:28:10] god backed up
[1:28:14] but shortly
[1:28:15] shortly
[1:28:18] shortly
[1:28:19] he was off his mountain
[1:28:22] and we finally first kings 19 and they
[1:28:24] have
[1:28:25] my
[1:28:26] he had to report this to jezebel
[1:28:30] oh jesse honey let me tell you what the
[1:28:32] prophet elijah had just done
[1:28:37] your prophets were out there screaming
[1:28:39] cutting acting ridiculous and they never
[1:28:43] never bail never whispered a word
[1:28:46] never showed up
[1:28:48] elijah restored the altar
[1:28:50] dug a trench
[1:28:52] poured water on it not once not twice
[1:28:54] but three times i mean there was honey
[1:28:56] there was water everywhere
[1:28:58] there was a water enough for us to swim
[1:29:00] in
[1:29:02] and then he called on yahweh
[1:29:05] he called on
[1:29:06] jehovah god and jehovah god came down
[1:29:10] and he licked up the sacrifice he dried
[1:29:13] up the water
[1:29:14] and not only that honey he chased your
[1:29:16] 400 prophets and slew every one of them
[1:29:20] you would think she had a conversion
[1:29:25] no not old jezebel
[1:29:29] she sent elijah a note
[1:29:32] elijah boy

[1:30:28] and here he is running for his life at
[1:30:31] the threat of a woman

[1:30:35] caught fire now

[1:31:02] glory of the lord come down he prayed
[1:31:04] fire out of heavens and then he prayed
[1:31:06] the rain to come on the earth and under
[1:31:08] all his strain his nerves were about
[1:31:10] broken
[1:31:12] oh how i can feel for him
[1:31:15] he says and here we find him first
[1:31:17] preaching to a backslidden nation of
[1:31:19] people and to jezebel that wanted her
[1:31:21] way and the people had come to a place
[1:31:23] that they had forsaken god forsaken his
[1:31:25] promises his commandments no longer kept
[1:31:27] his statutes and they carried nothing
[1:31:29] for him and elijah in the midst of all
[1:31:31] this he could not compromise he had to
[1:31:34] stand true on his convictions
[1:31:36] and that reflects in this day
[1:31:39] so he stood there at the threat of a
[1:31:41] woman elijah's nerves had been on a
[1:31:43] strain he had performed great miracles
[1:31:46] he's done signs up on the hill to prove
[1:31:48] that god was still god and god could
[1:31:50] answer any way by any miracle he says
[1:31:53] what did he bring the results a threat
[1:31:55] for his own life you would have thought
[1:31:56] she would have converted you would have
[1:31:58] thought it would have brought a
[1:31:59] universal revival you would have thought
[1:32:01] it would have brought a nation back to
[1:32:02] god but instead of bringing a nation
[1:32:04] back to god it brought a death warrant
[1:32:06] on his life and elijah soon came off his
[1:32:09] mountain
[1:32:10] like many of us
[1:32:14] he was trying with all his heart in them
[1:32:17] and everything that he had to show the
[1:32:18] people that god was still god
[1:32:21] he was a living god he was a present
[1:32:23] tense god and the prophet of god would
[1:32:25] say it backfired on him and he ran out
[1:32:27] into the wilderness when he heard of it
[1:32:30] and there he laid under a juniper tree
[1:32:32] trying to find consolation
[1:32:35] see he was criticized
[1:32:37] he was threatened
[1:32:40] and here he was
[1:32:42] you and i will look back at the backdrop
[1:32:44] of this and we've seen supernatural
[1:32:46] after supernatural after supernatural
[1:32:49] after supernatural and now we find
[1:32:52] oh my
[1:32:54] i taught this elijah
[1:32:56] i thought this elijah was a prophet
[1:33:00] look at him he's running
[1:33:02] he's running
[1:33:04] i mean all my confidence is in what he'd
[1:33:06] done look you know we looked at the
[1:33:09] signs we looked at the wonders
[1:33:12] but we don't look at the strain that he
[1:33:13] was under
[1:33:15] we don't look at the anointing that he
[1:33:17] was under during his time
[1:33:21] see he was criticized
[1:33:22] his values were threatened his his
[1:33:24] beliefs were threatened and your values
[1:33:26] and beliefs will be threatened you're
[1:33:27] going to be talked about you're going to
[1:33:28] be made fun of you're going to be
[1:33:30] ridiculed they'll make fun of how you
[1:33:31] dress they're going to make fun of your
[1:33:32] long hair they're going to make fun of
[1:33:34] your holiness standard
[1:33:38] but you can't compromise
[1:33:41] you got to stay with the word and elijah
[1:33:43] did not compromise
[1:33:45] he didn't bend on doctrine
[1:33:48] he didn't preach a tickle-to-the-ear
[1:33:50] message
[1:33:52] he didn't preach to feel the offering
[1:33:54] plate
[1:33:55] he wasn't preaching to the greater thai
[1:33:57] players or con conceding to them and
[1:34:00] their their desires
[1:34:02] he stayed with god said no matter who
[1:34:05] his audience was he didn't preach an
[1:34:08] intellectual gospel he demonstrated the
[1:34:11] dynamics of the holy spirit
[1:34:13] he demonstrated the dynamics of god
[1:34:16] and this made jezebel
[1:34:19] furious
[1:34:22] it made her furious notice brother brown
[1:34:25] says in god in his word he goes i want
[1:34:26] her sometimes i get so discouraged
[1:34:28] it's a wonder my wife can put up with me
[1:34:31] i go around and after a meeting i feel
[1:34:33] so moody i cry while i walk around the
[1:34:35] wow i'm a total figure i don't see why
[1:34:38] the lord ever had anything to do with me
[1:34:40] it's coming out from under the anointing
[1:34:46] see he's coming out from under the
[1:34:48] anointing and he begins to cry and begin
[1:34:50] to wander and if you how many ministers
[1:34:52] here don't raise your hand but you know
[1:34:54] after you deliver your heart and you
[1:34:56] preach it and it seems like it just it
[1:34:58] doesn't go that way or you hear a snod
[1:35:00] comment and all of a sudden you're just
[1:35:02] thrown into topsy-turvy and you're all
[1:35:04] moody and you s inside you're crying and
[1:35:07] weeping because why you delivered your
[1:35:09] heart
[1:35:11] and you're coming out of that
[1:35:12] anointing he says when you're up there
[1:35:16] you feel like you can pack the world
[1:35:17] away but when you're down here he says
[1:35:20] it's all right see when you're in the
[1:35:21] mountaintop it's okay you can pack the
[1:35:23] word away when you're in the valley he
[1:35:25] said it's okay he says it's becoming
[1:35:27] between the two
[1:35:29] when you're coming out
[1:35:30] of that anointing coming off of that
[1:35:33] mountaintop
[1:35:35] and i hope this will encourage you
[1:35:36] here's a prophet of god your example of
[1:35:39] this hour
[1:35:41] just describing
[1:35:43] displaying to you that he faced these
[1:35:45] troubled times as well
[1:35:47] in his own spirit in his own flesh and
[1:35:49] his own body in his own mind
[1:35:51] he didn't know how god will use him
[1:35:53] thought he was a total of failure see
[1:35:54] we're not alone we all face these
[1:35:57] mountaintops
[1:35:59] and these juniper tree experiences
[1:36:02] notice jonah jonah was swallowed by a
[1:36:05] well spent three days in a well's belly
[1:36:07] that's a sheer miracle he made it out
[1:36:08] alive the fish came to nineveh spit them
[1:36:11] out said i had enough of you jonah your
[1:36:14] message makes me sick spewed him out on
[1:36:16] the bank and he went and preached the
[1:36:17] gospel saved the whole nation and jonah
[1:36:20] instead of rejoicing in what god had
[1:36:21] done he climbs up on a mountain sits
[1:36:23] under a tree and wants to commit suicide
[1:36:27] because he's coming out of the anointing
[1:36:30] william copper the one who
[1:36:33] who wrote the hymn there's a fountain
[1:36:35] filled with blood after the inspiration
[1:36:36] left him the prophet of god would tell
[1:36:38] us he tried to file a river to commit
[1:36:39] suicide stephen and foster when the
[1:36:41] inspiration left him he called a servant
[1:36:44] took a razor and he did commit suicide
[1:36:47] see people don't know what those people
[1:36:50] that live in the spiritual realm go
[1:36:51] through
[1:36:52] it's coming out
[1:36:54] you're okay as long as you're on the
[1:36:56] mountain you're okay as long as you're
[1:36:57] in the valley
[1:36:59] but it's when you're hanging between the
[1:37:00] two
[1:37:03] he goes oh what a powerful anointing
[1:37:05] elijah had
[1:37:07] and when that anointing left him he was
[1:37:09] 40 days wandering out there in the
[1:37:11] wilderness and god found him pulled back
[1:37:13] in a cave
[1:37:15] that's right no need to try to explain
[1:37:17] it you can't
[1:37:19] so let me just give y'all some
[1:37:21] some good gospel teaching for just a
[1:37:23] minute
[1:37:24] one word or one phrase
[1:37:27] it's never
[1:37:29] never a good thing
[1:37:32] though it be in jest
[1:37:34] though it being joke
[1:37:36] when a brother just delivers his heart
[1:37:39] or that special singer delivers that
[1:37:41] song
[1:37:42] or that musician plays with all their
[1:37:44] heart
[1:37:45] to go up there and make a backhanded
[1:37:46] comment
[1:37:48] well you wouldn't preach so long or you
[1:37:50] wouldn't shout so much you wouldn't miss
[1:37:52] if you i heard your voice crack and well
[1:37:54] duh they heard it too
[1:37:57] i heard you mess up on the panel you
[1:37:58] didn't have to be
[1:37:59] all this that and the there on a piano
[1:38:01] we got a young man in our church plays
[1:38:03] piano
[1:38:04] wonderful phenomenal he gets criticized
[1:38:06] because he's free
[1:38:08] that's his form of worship
[1:38:10] and people criticize because he's free
[1:38:14] never a good opportunity never a good
[1:38:16] time when that brother that sister
[1:38:19] delivers their heart to go make a
[1:38:21] backhanded comment there's time for
[1:38:23] instructive criticism later
[1:38:25] not immediately after service
[1:38:28] give them some time to come out of that
[1:38:29] anointing
[1:38:30] give them some time to get back into the
[1:38:32] valley so they can decipher they can
[1:38:35] have their bearings
[1:38:36] they can get their grass on life once
[1:38:39] again i've been there i've had a brother
[1:38:41] tell me he says my all you do is shout
[1:38:43] oh well
[1:38:45] you should be used to it
[1:38:48] you know when i first started preaching
[1:38:49] many years ago and that's the only thing
[1:38:51] i knew how to do
[1:38:53] shout shout shout shout shout
[1:38:55] but it's real to me but yet instead of
[1:38:58] being constructive about it later
[1:39:00] it wants to hit you right when you
[1:39:02] deliver it i mean yeah when you're just
[1:39:03] starting preaching you're not an expert
[1:39:06] you're a novice you're gonna fumble
[1:39:08] around you're gonna make mistakes you're
[1:39:10] gonna sound stupid to yourself and to
[1:39:13] others
[1:39:14] let me just say this if you don't like
[1:39:16] the message
[1:39:18] don't lie about it
[1:39:20] just don't be negative
[1:39:22] if you didn't like the song you ain't
[1:39:23] got to lie about it just don't be
[1:39:25] negative if you didn't like the play and
[1:39:27] you don't have to lie about it just
[1:39:29] don't be negative
[1:39:32] you ain't got to go in there well i sure
[1:39:33] enjoyed you're playing
[1:39:36] no you didn't your eyes just said you
[1:39:38] hated it
[1:39:39] i sure enjoyed that preaching today
[1:39:41] brother joe no you didn't
[1:39:43] he sat there and slept the entire
[1:39:44] service
[1:39:47] so that's
[1:39:49] when a brother
[1:39:51] or sister is coming out of that
[1:39:52] anointing
[1:39:53] be cognizant
[1:39:55] be cognizant
[1:39:57] that they're coming out of it it's a
[1:39:59] difficult spot
[1:40:01] it's a difficult spot
[1:40:03] but see instead of jezebel
[1:40:06] said of jezebel turning her heart toward
[1:40:09] god
[1:40:10] she puts a death threat on elijah's life
[1:40:13] and we find here we start
[1:40:16] trying to wind this down
[1:40:18] in first kings 19 and verse 3 and when
[1:40:20] he saw that he arose and he went for his
[1:40:22] life and he came to bresheba which
[1:40:24] belonged to judah and he left his
[1:40:27] servant there
[1:40:29] but he himself went a day's journey into
[1:40:32] the wilderness and he came and he sat
[1:40:35] under a juniper tree
[1:40:38] and he requested now here's a great
[1:40:40] prophet of god
[1:40:42] mighty signs
[1:40:43] nobody can
[1:40:44] deny that my i mean he just had
[1:40:47] supernatural supernatural
[1:40:49] he requested for himself that he
[1:40:52] might die
[1:40:54] but i thought he was a prophet
[1:40:57] he is a prophet
[1:40:58] but he's also human
[1:41:03] he's also
[1:41:04] human
[1:41:06] just as human as you and i just a
[1:41:09] different office
[1:41:12] and we find now he leaves his servant
[1:41:15] first thing somebody does when
[1:41:16] depression comes
[1:41:20] is they leave the pack
[1:41:22] and they get all by their self
[1:41:24] so you know when somebody's dealing with
[1:41:25] depression
[1:41:28] now the first one's up when the service
[1:41:30] says dismiss they're in their car and
[1:41:32] they're gone
[1:41:34] when they're battling depression
[1:41:36] if they don't want to have a little sob
[1:41:37] story where everybody crowd around and
[1:41:39] they just rehash and rehash and rehash
[1:41:41] they're all by themselves and now elijah
[1:41:43] finds himself he leaves his servant at
[1:41:45] beersheba and he goes and he wanders
[1:41:47] through the desert now he's wondering
[1:41:48] with his own thoughts he's wandering
[1:41:50] with depression he's wondering what the
[1:41:52] anxieties he's free for all of his life
[1:41:54] he's got all this stuff and where does
[1:41:56] he find himself under a broom plant
[1:42:01] he finds himself wandering through
[1:42:04] tucson
[1:42:07] a desert
[1:42:09] dry
[1:42:10] prickly
[1:42:12] i know y'all think it's pretty ugly
[1:42:18] i mean there's no greenery nowhere
[1:42:23] and of all places
[1:42:25] there's only one tree
[1:42:28] and it happens to be a broom plant
[1:42:31] a juniper tree
[1:42:33] and he's weary brother aaron he's tired
[1:42:36] from the journey his nerves are shook up
[1:42:39] and he leans against that broom plant
[1:42:42] that juniper tree
[1:42:44] and he takes a nap
[1:42:47] oh the sun's beating down you know how
[1:42:48] it is in the arizona tucson sun it's hot
[1:42:53] and we find brother branham says elijah
[1:42:55] his nerves our own edge anyhow
[1:42:58] he always always felt sorry for him his
[1:43:00] nerves was about ready to break anyhow
[1:43:03] and that great pound from jezebel just
[1:43:05] finished a stroke then he run and he
[1:43:07] went into the wilderness and he laid
[1:43:09] under the juniper tree
[1:43:12] he says oh that experience
[1:43:15] of the juniper tree
[1:43:17] you know many times we think about the
[1:43:19] juniper tree experience and we have a
[1:43:21] negative connotation with it
[1:43:23] it seems to have a negative vibe but
[1:43:25] it's not
[1:43:27] the juniper tree has just as much
[1:43:30] purpose in the plan of god as your
[1:43:32] mountaintop
[1:43:35] your juniper tree has just it's my if
[1:43:38] not more purpose
[1:43:40] than your mountaintop
[1:43:43] he says now there's many of us and i'm
[1:43:46] just going to raise my hands
[1:43:48] there's many of us that find ourselves
[1:43:50] under the juniper tree i get myself
[1:43:53] under there many times to a place that
[1:43:55] you just don't know what to do you're
[1:43:57] frustrated frankly i'm right under it
[1:44:00] now and wondering oh god
[1:44:03] what would you have me to do
[1:44:07] see the juniper tree
[1:44:10] is a part of the christian experience
[1:44:13] brother brown says oh the experience
[1:44:17] of the juniper tree
[1:44:21] the experience you have to experience
[1:44:24] what took place
[1:44:26] at the juniper tree
[1:44:28] we're going to get into that
[1:44:30] see when you're at the juniper tree you
[1:44:32] find yourself how many are at the
[1:44:34] juniper tree today
[1:44:36] i've got a couple real christians here
[1:44:38] this morning the rest of you are faking
[1:44:40] it
[1:44:42] you find yourself under juniper street
[1:44:44] don't question
[1:44:45] why you're there
[1:44:47] don't say why am i here god what did i
[1:44:49] do to deserve this why me lord
[1:44:53] don't question it don't fight against it
[1:44:56] don't struggle with it when you find
[1:44:59] yourself at your juniper tree
[1:45:03] rest
[1:45:05] rest
[1:45:07] rest
[1:45:08] well brother joe that sounds so simple
[1:45:11] elijah took a nap
[1:45:16] he had a death warrant on his head
[1:45:20] and yet he got to this place
[1:45:22] in a vast wilderness
[1:45:25] all alone with his thoughts weary
[1:45:27] depressed
[1:45:29] anxious
[1:45:30] and he went to sleep he rested
[1:45:34] he rested in what brother aaron he
[1:45:36] rested in knowing that god had called
[1:45:39] him to do what he
[1:45:42] did and if he had to rest in that god
[1:45:46] called him to do that then he has to
[1:45:47] have rest in his weakest moment god was
[1:45:50] going to be there for him
[1:45:52] and the bible would tell us in matthew
[1:45:54] 11 verse 28 says come unto me all ye
[1:45:56] that are labor and heavy laden and i
[1:45:59] will give you rest
[1:46:03] take my yoke upon you learn of me i am
[1:46:06] meek and lowly in heart and you shall
[1:46:08] find rest unto your souls for my yoke is
[1:46:11] easy and my burden is light
[1:46:16] see when you find yourself under your
[1:46:19] juniper tree
[1:46:21] rest in god's peace
[1:46:24] rest in god's promise rest in god's
[1:46:27] provision for you resting knowing that
[1:46:30] god has a solution to all your problems
[1:46:35] resting knowing that god said he will
[1:46:38] never leave you nor will he forsake you
[1:46:42] rest in knowing that he's a high priest
[1:46:44] that he says you can be touched or i can
[1:46:46] be touched by the feelings of your
[1:46:49] infirmities resting knowing that the
[1:46:52] trial that you're in hasn't caught him
[1:46:54] by surprise
[1:46:56] rest and knowing
[1:46:58] that what you're going through is
[1:46:59] working to your good
[1:47:02] see god has a purpose
[1:47:06] god has a purpose for your juniper tree
[1:47:10] brother bam says and i think that's
[1:47:11] about the way the church needs tonight
[1:47:13] is a repair a place under the juniper
[1:47:16] tree so we can be alone
[1:47:21] be alone
[1:47:22] just you
[1:47:23] and god
[1:47:25] just you
[1:47:27] and god
[1:47:29] you left everybody back at beersheba
[1:47:31] everybody back at the mountaintop now
[1:47:34] it's just you
[1:47:35] and god
[1:47:37] it may look miserable
[1:47:39] it may look barren it may look destitute
[1:47:44] but god planted a tree for you in your
[1:47:48] desert
[1:47:50] god planted a juniper tree
[1:47:53] you know think about this i was thinking
[1:47:55] about this on the way to church this
[1:47:56] morning how many years
[1:47:59] before elijah ever walked down in that
[1:48:01] valley
[1:48:02] through that vast desert
[1:48:04] that god dropped a seed
[1:48:09] and all of a sudden
[1:48:10] it's dry they don't get much moisture
[1:48:13] a little rain come by once a year and
[1:48:15] maybe it grew a little
[1:48:16] bit and grew a little bit maybe 150
[1:48:19] years and it finally got to where it
[1:48:21] could provide shade
[1:48:23] because god knew he was going to have a
[1:48:25] prophet
[1:48:26] that needed
[1:48:28] a place of refuge
[1:48:30] and god
[1:48:31] predestinated according to his purpose
[1:48:34] dropped a seed
[1:48:36] in tucson
[1:48:38] he says i got you a juniper tree
[1:48:42] i got you somewhere provided i got you
[1:48:44] some shade
[1:48:45] i got you some relief
[1:48:47] from all the storms of life
[1:48:50] from all the threats from all your
[1:48:52] worries from all your fears
[1:48:54] years went by and the tree grew a little
[1:48:57] bit and grew a little bit and grew a
[1:48:59] little bit but god knowing the future he
[1:49:02] knew that elijah was coming and that
[1:49:04] elijah was gonna face his moment and
[1:49:06] elijah was gonna need special care and
[1:49:08] some special attention so god dropped
[1:49:10] the seed
[1:49:15] god dropped the seed
[1:49:16] god knew that tucson tabernacle would be
[1:49:18] without a pastor but god dropped the
[1:49:21] seed
[1:49:24] so when's that seed coming when's that
[1:49:26] pastor coming he's dropped that seed
[1:49:30] be faithful
[1:49:32] be faithful
[1:49:34] in your desert be faithful let him bring
[1:49:37] the winds let him bring the reins
[1:49:40] it's his obligation to water that seed
[1:49:44] to provide
[1:49:45] in the time of a desert place
[1:49:47] notice now as we'll keep going
[1:49:50] because i think about the way the church
[1:49:51] needs tonight is a place under the
[1:49:53] juniper tree so we can be alone he said
[1:49:56] there he lays speaking about elijah he
[1:49:59] laid under the juniper tree he didn't
[1:50:00] know what to do his nerves were all
[1:50:02] broke up he was shaking he was crying no
[1:50:05] doubt he was in a terrible condition and
[1:50:08] many of us hit those places especially
[1:50:12] after a mount carmel experience
[1:50:14] he goes it was asked to me the other day
[1:50:16] by someone about it says what can be
[1:50:18] done for us at that time
[1:50:20] he said there's only one thing to do and
[1:50:22] that's commit yourself to god
[1:50:25] he said god has to do something for
[1:50:28] every man that comes under the juniper
[1:50:31] tree or he'll go to pieces
[1:50:34] god has to do it
[1:50:36] he goes i've had those feelings after i
[1:50:38] come out of a meeting i looked like i
[1:50:40] tried i preached and i begged and
[1:50:42] persuaded i've seen the angel god sweep
[1:50:44] through a meeting and do signs and
[1:50:46] wonders and i sat in the car on the
[1:50:48] outside and i hear them say well it was
[1:50:50] nothing but psychology
[1:50:54] there's nothing to it nothing to it at
[1:50:56] all all nonsense he says then i crawled
[1:50:59] under the juniper tree and i said lord
[1:51:02] why did you
[1:51:03] what did you let me do that for what can
[1:51:06] be done
[1:51:07] but we all hit those places
[1:51:11] he says god knows your trials
[1:51:15] he knows all about it
[1:51:18] you that raised your hand at the
[1:51:20] beginning of the service
[1:51:22] saying oh brother joe remember me i'm
[1:51:24] i'm going through this and i got this
[1:51:26] and maybe you didn't raise your hand but
[1:51:27] your hearts felt pulled and you know you
[1:51:29] know we sing the songs never left you
[1:51:31] alone and see god knows all about it
[1:51:35] he says but there is more
[1:51:37] work to be done
[1:51:39] the juniper tree wasn't elijah's final
[1:51:42] resting place
[1:51:45] it was only a pit stop
[1:51:47] for the journey ahead yes
[1:51:49] it was only a place notice he says poor
[1:51:52] skinny fella laying there gray hair
[1:51:54] hanging all around and he goes i can
[1:51:56] imagine there was ten thousands of
[1:51:58] angels watching him sleep
[1:52:00] could you just imagine
[1:52:03] hearing that you're underneath your
[1:52:05] juniper tree
[1:52:08] and you're just at home sleeping praying
[1:52:10] god get me out of it
[1:52:12] ten thousand angels just watching
[1:52:15] look at him

[1:52:19] oh my i mean there's a rhythm to his
[1:52:21] snore
[1:52:24] just smooth he's relaxed
[1:52:27] program said
[1:52:29] here he is ten thousand angels watching
[1:52:31] him sleep
[1:52:33] he goes i can see on every branch swarms
[1:52:35] of angels just watching
[1:52:37] and he'd call the angel
[1:52:39] that has the softest hands
[1:52:42] to come and stroke his brow

[1:53:08] and yet this was a place where elijah
[1:53:11] was going to get special care
[1:53:14] the angel with the softest hands

[1:55:55] one time i put a pistol against my head
[1:55:57] to commit
[1:55:58] suicide your prophet
[1:56:02] my prophet well i thought he was a
[1:56:04] prophet i thought he he had these great
[1:56:05] supernatural signs he raised the dead he
[1:56:08] healed the sick he did
[1:56:09] but he's still a human
[1:56:12] he still faced the struggles of humanity
[1:56:14] just like you and i
[1:56:17] he goes i put a pistol to my head to
[1:56:18] commit suicide but i couldn't do it i
[1:56:20] took my glove off to lay it on a high
[1:56:22] voltage line where i was working but i
[1:56:23] couldn't do it something still held the
[1:56:26] same god that was with elijah the same
[1:56:29] god that's today he seen me under my
[1:56:32] juniper tree my wife my baby laying
[1:56:35] yonder in the grave my daddy my brother
[1:56:37] and all and i was just about to i was
[1:56:39] about going myself and i've laid under
[1:56:41] the juniper tree it's hard
[1:56:43] he goes i got to the place where i was
[1:56:45] beside myself i tried to make a gun
[1:56:48] shoot my brains out and it wouldn't do
[1:56:49] it see there's work yet to be done
[1:56:53] something has to be done
[1:56:55] god wasn't finished
[1:56:57] then we look in the life story and i
[1:56:59] want to share this he says oh god but in
[1:57:02] heaven somewhere you got my little girl
[1:57:04] there i'm almost a fanatic almost a
[1:57:06] mental collapse i took my rubber glove
[1:57:08] off 2 300 votes running through the
[1:57:10] right side of the a million exam i hate
[1:57:12] to be a coward but sherry honey daddy's
[1:57:15] coming to see you this morning and i
[1:57:16] laid my hand on that wire how i didn't
[1:57:18] break every bone in my body how i don't
[1:57:20] know unless god had ordained that this
[1:57:22] gift should go on for he goes the next
[1:57:24] thing you know i was sitting on the
[1:57:26] ground perspiration running off my face
[1:57:28] i took the spurs i put them in the truck
[1:57:29] i went down i went home i went around
[1:57:31] the house picked up the mail went around
[1:57:33] the house a few months has passed it
[1:57:35] turned cool cold weather frost was
[1:57:37] coming up through the floor there i
[1:57:39] wouldn't go nowhere notice he was in a
[1:57:41] valley
[1:57:43] i we didn't see we didn't have very much
[1:57:45] but what we had we lived with it
[1:57:47] together and i was at home
[1:57:49] it was a sweet home to me and i didn't
[1:57:51] care how it was it was her furniture and
[1:57:54] i wanted to stay at home and i went
[1:57:56] inside the house and the first letter i
[1:57:58] looked at miss sharon rose branham 80
[1:58:01] cents christmas savings oh my it was all
[1:58:04] over again i knelt down on the floor
[1:58:06] there i started crying i said god please
[1:58:08] have mercy upon me i'll take my own life
[1:58:10] i've been a warden in the room i had a
[1:58:12] gun i went in there to get the gun i put
[1:58:14] some shells in and i pulled the hammer
[1:58:16] back on the gun i said lord god i've
[1:58:18] gone wild i don't know i was out of my
[1:58:20] mind i put it up beside my head and i
[1:58:22] said oh father who art in heaven
[1:58:24] hallowed be thy name i squeezed a hammer
[1:58:26] it wouldn't fall i said oh lord i can't
[1:58:28] even take my life and i threw the gun
[1:58:30] down and it shot off through the house
[1:58:32] and i went on like that i thought god
[1:58:34] why have i gone crazy i've lost my mind
[1:58:38] a prophet of god another elijah under a
[1:58:41] juniper tree
[1:58:43] but that wasn't the end
[1:58:46] of his life it was only
[1:58:48] a place that he can receive
[1:58:51] special attention
[1:58:53] and when you find yourself church
[1:58:56] under your juniper tree know this
[1:58:58] it's not the end of the story
[1:59:01] it's not over until god says it's over
[1:59:04] the juniper tree was only a pit stop
[1:59:08] between what was coming just ahead
[1:59:10] brother said he was poor tired weary
[1:59:12] servant saw him he know where he was he
[1:59:15] knows where you are tonight you may be
[1:59:18] under a juniper tree everything gone but
[1:59:20] remember he knows where
[1:59:23] you are
[1:59:25] and he says and i believe god placed
[1:59:27] that juniper tree
[1:59:29] for a purpose
[1:59:31] the purpose of god
[1:59:34] will not
[1:59:35] be
[1:59:36] defeated whether you find yourself on
[1:59:38] the mountain whether you find yourself
[1:59:41] in the valley whether you find yourself
[1:59:43] on the juniper tree no matter where you
[1:59:46] find yourself it works in the purpose
[1:59:49] and plan of god
[1:59:51] i believe this is in what here is thou
[1:59:53] elijah i believe that juniper tree was
[1:59:56] put in the ground there for that purpose
[2:00:01] god knew he was going to have an elijah
[2:00:03] and god knew that elijah was going to
[2:00:05] need special attention and god knows the
[2:00:08] same about you
[2:00:10] oh how we need in this journey
[2:00:13] that we're in now to find a place of
[2:00:15] rest and feast on the word of god
[2:00:18] so that it'll give us strength
[2:00:22] so when you find yourself as we bring
[2:00:24] this to a close you find yourself this
[2:00:26] morning
[2:00:27] maybe in the future
[2:00:30] maybe you're all alone you feel down in
[2:00:32] the dumps just be assured
[2:00:34] that god has allowed you to come to that
[2:00:36] point
[2:00:37] for a purpose
[2:00:39] see just as god has purposed a
[2:00:41] mountaintop
[2:00:43] he has a purpose for the experience
[2:00:46] of the juniper tree
[2:00:47] notice elijah didn't get that special
[2:00:50] care on the mountaintop
[2:00:53] when he was calling fire down he didn't
[2:00:55] get that special stroke
[2:00:57] from the angel's hand he wasn't eating
[2:01:00] on the special meal that was provided
[2:01:03] but it was down in the valley
[2:01:05] under his juniper tree when he was weary
[2:01:09] worn out
[2:01:10] tired that god said
[2:01:13] i've seen what you've done
[2:01:16] i care about you i love you
[2:01:19] therefore i'm gonna allow the angel with
[2:01:20] the softest hands
[2:01:23] to put you to sleep
[2:01:26] i got that we got some good cooks in
[2:01:27] louisiana
[2:01:29] i mean some mean cooks
[2:01:32] but we don't have one like this angel
[2:01:35] spiritual food in due season
[2:01:38] exactly
[2:01:39] what you have need of
[2:01:41] when you have need of it
[2:01:43] the right word
[2:01:44] the right scripture the right quote
[2:01:48] the right message at the right time
[2:01:51] for your juniper tree
[2:01:53] i spoke this message last week at home
[2:01:55] first time i spoke it we had a young
[2:01:57] girl
[2:01:59] just on the friday night before sunday
[2:02:02] had a bottle of pills threatening to
[2:02:03] take her life she found herself under a
[2:02:06] juniper tree
[2:02:07] and god begins to come back on sunday
[2:02:09] morning
[2:02:10] speaking about how a prophet of god was
[2:02:12] wanting to take his life
[2:02:14] because he found himself on a juniper
[2:02:17] tree and remember
[2:02:19] god has to do something for every man
[2:02:22] that's underneath the juniper tree
[2:02:25] god
[2:02:26] has to do it
[2:02:28] so here we find forsaken
[2:02:30] but not forgotten
[2:02:33] god hasn't left you to wander in your
[2:02:35] wilderness alone
[2:02:36] he hasn't left you to face your trial
[2:02:38] your sickness alone
[2:02:40] but god's provided for you the
[2:02:41] experience
[2:02:43] of the juniper tree
[2:02:45] embrace
[2:02:46] your juniper tree experience
[2:02:49] thank you god
[2:02:52] instead of turning into why me
[2:02:56] fiery trial
[2:02:57] thank you lord
[2:02:59] you have confidence that i'm going to
[2:03:01] make it through this
[2:03:03] see god provided
[2:03:06] and god continues to provide for his
[2:03:07] elect
[2:03:08] elijah wanted to die musicians if you
[2:03:11] could come back
[2:03:13] like all of us we hit those moments
[2:03:15] you want to throw your hands up
[2:03:17] give up it seems like life is impossible
[2:03:20] nothing seems to be going your way
[2:03:25] seems like everything just
[2:03:27] seems to fall apart you know some people
[2:03:29] everything they touch turns to gold
[2:03:31] everything i touch everything you tu
[2:03:33] turns to mold
[2:03:38] we have those days
[2:03:40] we have those months weeks and we have
[2:03:42] those years
[2:03:43] but no matter where you find yourself
[2:03:46] maybe you've had that cross your mind i
[2:03:48] just want to die
[2:03:49] i'm just so weary life has been unfair
[2:03:53] it's been miserable brother joe you just
[2:03:54] don't understand what i've gone through
[2:03:58] see like all of us we hit we all
[2:04:01] profit not profit
[2:04:03] great men of god great women i got all
[2:04:06] down through the ages all through
[2:04:07] humanity we all have hit this place
[2:04:11] therefore god
[2:04:14] dropped a seed
[2:04:16] and he provided you a refuge
[2:04:19] in laodicea
[2:04:21] he provided you a message that you can
[2:04:24] come and rest under
[2:04:27] and then this message has everything you
[2:04:29] have need of
[2:04:32] you got the best ministry
[2:04:34] in this message
[2:04:36] you've got the greatest word who's ever
[2:04:39] that has ever come across this world is
[2:04:41] in this man we got the restoration of
[2:04:43] the gifts we got the restoration of the
[2:04:45] word we got all the loose sins tied up
[2:04:47] the seals have been removed off the back
[2:04:50] of the book we understand who we are we
[2:04:53] see clearly
[2:04:56] who we are
[2:04:59] what greater message what greater refuge
[2:05:02] but all elijah could see was what was
[2:05:05] behind brother aaron
[2:05:07] man he saw this trouble that trouble all
[2:05:10] he could think about was jezebel
[2:05:12] her threat
[2:05:14] i wonder how close she is i wonder she's
[2:05:16] found me i wonder she's here you know
[2:05:18] what elijah couldn't see
[2:05:21] just a couple of scriptures just a
[2:05:23] couple of chapters later
[2:05:25] [Music]
[2:05:26] you know sometimes we fail to see what's
[2:05:29] just ahead you want to know what's just
[2:05:31] ahead
[2:05:34] okay some of y'all do y'all that are
[2:05:36] listening
[2:05:36] let's go in the second kings 2 and verse
[2:05:38] 11.
[2:05:39] see elijah can only see about his past
[2:05:41] all the hardships all the threat all the
[2:05:44] anxiety all the fear all the depression
[2:05:47] all the sickness no doubt it took an
[2:05:49] effect on his body but what elijah
[2:05:51] couldn't see was just a few chapters
[2:05:52] later his life was about to change and
[2:05:55] we found here in second kings 11 and it
[2:05:57] came to pass as they stood still or they
[2:06:00] still went on and talked that behold
[2:06:03] there appeared a chariot of fire in
[2:06:05] horses of fire and it parted them
[2:06:07] asunder and elijah went up by a world
[2:06:10] went into heaven
[2:06:12] well elijah couldn't see that there was
[2:06:14] a rapture for himself just a few
[2:06:16] chapters later all this hardship all the
[2:06:19] animosity everything that he's gone
[2:06:22] through that's all he could focus on but
[2:06:24] god had provided a juniper tree as a

[2:10:15] say thank you god
[2:10:17] she knew what i had need of
[2:10:19] when i had need of it
[2:10:21] now i'm going on the strength of what i
[2:10:23] just had under my juniper tree
[2:10:25] experience
[2:10:26] i got exactly what i had need of
[2:10:30] now i got strength to carry the journey
[2:10:33] the next place we find elijah he's
[2:10:36] tucked away in a cave

[2:11:04] satan does not have the final say
[2:11:06] because you know the bible tells us
[2:11:09] in revelations 10 and verse 8 that
[2:11:11] there's got to be a people in the land
[2:11:13] today that's got to prophesy again
[2:11:16] they've taken the book they've taken the
[2:11:17] word they ate on it they fed on it they
[2:11:19] feasted on it and now through their life
[2:11:22] they begin to prophesy exactly what the
[2:11:25] word says
[2:11:26] elijah began to prophesy exactly his
[2:11:30] experience as a juniper tree
[2:11:32] god met me
[2:11:34] he never worried about jezebel again
[2:11:39] never
[2:11:41] jezebel was taken care of because god
[2:11:45] had already seen
[2:11:46] what he would do with his prophet
[2:11:48] and god has seen your enemy and i want
[2:11:51] you to know this morning your enemy is
[2:11:52] taken care of
[2:11:55] dig your valley
[2:11:56] full of ditches and while you're digging
[2:11:59] he's destroying your enemies
[2:12:02] while you're digging
[2:12:04] he's destroying your enemies you need
[2:12:05] prayer this morning we're here to pray
[2:12:06] with you the service is not quite like

[2:12:24] saved
[2:12:25] can i really have the holy ghost of what
[2:12:27] i'm going through i'm struggling i'm
[2:12:28] struggling it's a part
[2:12:30] of the purpose of god
[2:12:34] the juniper tree is just just
[2:12:38] as much in the plan of god
[2:12:40] as any mountaintop experience that
[2:12:43] you'll ever have
[2:12:45] frankly
[2:12:47] it's greater
[2:12:49] that's where you really receive a
[2:12:50] special touch
[2:12:53] a special touch anybody can praise god
[2:12:55] on a mountaintop
[2:12:59] but when you feel like giving up you
[2:13:02] feel like giving in
[2:13:03] you drag yourself to church on a
[2:13:05] wednesday night

[2:18:29] and we've all questioned why a juniper
[2:18:31] tree
[2:18:32] and today god answered why
[2:18:36] juniper tree is when he tends to you
[2:18:39] personally
[2:18:40] when he strokes your brow
[2:18:42] when he feeds you
[2:18:44] when he said child you're still mine

[2:19:05] very secrets of the heart

[2:19:18] out of the house after the family had
[2:19:20] left
[2:19:22] was going to go out back in the back
[2:19:23] part of the property and take his life
[2:19:28] but you stopped him before he got to
[2:19:30] that place
[2:19:32] and you put him all back together
[2:19:34] because there was still a work to be
[2:19:36] done
[2:19:38] and until you're finished with us lord

[2:19:49] or what to think
[2:19:51] but hey lord you we just remember
[2:19:54] that in that juniper tree experience
[2:19:57] that's when you tend and you meet and
[2:19:59] you talk with each individual person
[2:20:02] and say child you're mine
[2:20:04] i've never left you
[2:20:06] i'll never leave you as your mind
[2:20:09] your purpose will never be defeated lord
[2:20:13] may the one lord today that is
[2:20:15] discouraged
