of the Lord with my siblings in Christ we have some brothers and sisters that have brought needs to us and they brought them to us not to bring them to us but that through us it can strengthen their prayer and their reach out to the Lord that we can reach out in faith together on their behalf got a note here that Sister Anne Locker is sick at home requests prayer brother Ronnie glidewell is also sick at home and also desires prayer brother Kenny Phillips is having health issues at this time and my wife Heather's not here this morning she hasn't been feeling well for a few days but she expects to be here this evening um and those are the requests that we have here and I'm I'm going to take a moment of your time time because you need to stand up a little bit get the flood flowing right I've got a little testimony I want to give you because this is December 1st December 1st doesn't mean much to a lot of people but it means a lot to me and it was in 1966 that we left California San Jose area and came down to Tucson um my dad was a very quiet guy and he was never one that would say the Lord told me this or the Lord showed me that that that wasn't my dad but he prayed about it to come down here to Tucson and like the Lord told him arrive on December 1st arrive on December 1st so he came we came through to on that summer and he stopped at the Department of Economic Security whatever it was called in those days and registered that that here's my name and here's how you can reach me and these are my skills and I'll be here on December 1st and my dad was a guy that made uh lenses for for eyasses in those days and and they said don't come there's no work here there's nothing like that this is econ ically depressed don't come don't come don't come he said thank you very much I'll be there on December 1st so so uh so my parents came into town and they arrived uh the early evening of December 1st and and the phone number that my dad had left was with brother Ed dougall's parents who we knew from San Jose sister Joyce and brother Keith and that afternoon the phone rang at the dugall household and it turned out that a fellow would come into town started a place to make glasses hired a guy the guy kept getting drunk he fired him that day and he desperately needed somebody with my dad's exact skills and he needed that person on the afternoon of December 1st and that was a date that months before the Lord had told my dad December 1st December 1st so so December 1st means a lot to me so with that that hopefully boosts all of our faith just a little bit let's turn to the Lord in prayer if you've got something in your heart that you'd like the Lord to to answer raise your hand hold it in your heart whatever you're comfortable with but let's go to the Lord together in unity as the body of Christ in prayer Lord Jesus it is such an honor it is such a privilege to serve a living God lord we know that you know our needs before we even ask your word says that you will answer Lord for these requests that have been made known for for these burdens that are on my brothers and sisters hearts these needs Lord I just pray that you would reach out to each one given that assurance that you are there because Lord we don't have faith to believe this or faith to believe that but we have faith in you and Lord we know that through you you handle it all we

looks wellfed from Thanksgiving we gave the Lord a double thanks we had two thanksgivings this year we had we had one with one side of the family another with the other side of the family so I'm uh I'm looking twice as plump as anyone else it's good it's good to have it's good to be able to eat it's good to be able to get together it's good to be able to to fellowship with family especially around something that's so important I want to share with the church I um there's a sister that um she recently lost her husband she's a member of the church here and um she's really she's never really had the Lord in her life she's never had the Lord's always been in her life I'm sorry but she's never really had Church she's never been to church before and and the church has meant so much to her going through this hard time and losing her husband and and um I called her a couple days ago just to check on her make sure she's doing well and and she was so sweet she said um she immediately kind of got choked up and she said brother Daniel she says um everything's really good she says just really good she says I was able to to sell um she was able to sell um some of her husband's equipment and she said that that the price for the equipment was the money that she needed really to pay off um the biggest part of her debt and and she was just so thankful and she was so thankful for the church and in just her attitude she was saying like Lord is the Lord is just so good to us and then uh she says you know she says I'm uh she said you know my my family um they've been there's they've really been at odds with me trying to have take certain things that that were husbands and and that and and she said that some of the people um either from the neighborhood or from other people that she used to know have been coming around the house and and stealing things and stole just thousands of dollars worth of worth of stuff that was hers that she could have sold that she really needed and and and but she kept saying but but brother Daniel she says but God is so good God is so good to me and there she is this lady she's alone she really doesn't have anyone here but some of the neighborhood some of the people and she lives in a she lives way out there she doesn't have have neighbors really close but some of the neighbors will come and help her out when she needs help and she was quick to recognize them and and just to say how good God is even even though the lady is just struggling but you wouldn't know it with her attitude and it really it made me think first of all made me thank the Lord for all that I have and sometimes it takes losing everything that we have to be grateful for what we do have and brothers and sisters we should all be very very grateful to the Lord for the blessings that he's G given us that that we have a home to go to that we have food on the table that we have a church that we can fellowship at that we have friends that we have family there's just so much that we have our health brother Glenn when when when it when it starts to fade you realize how really important that it is I was praying for her last night and and I went to bed and I was I just I was praying for everybody and and what I do often when I pray is I'll go through each row just in my mind and I'll try to pray for each one that I remember and I was going through last night and praying and I went to bed and and I was just thanking the lord for his goodness and saying Lord just thank you for thank you for being there thank you that that no matter how bad things get no matter no matter what how our life would fall apart that we have a hope of Jesus Christ that we have promises that that this is just for a short time that this suffering is is really it's for our own good it's it's to build our character and then we're going to come out on the other side and I was as I was thinking on that and laying went to sleep and then and then I woke up maybe a few hours later and I uh I I had this thought in my mind just thinking about how important this book is to me and how much just I love it and it's just it's everything and and going through the pages by pages and and and I started thanking the Lord in the middle of the night last night about about how this is a blessing and this is my this is my strength everything else can fail but this will never fail it'll always be there for us and we can we can open it up and we can read these different stories and what's so wonderful is we can apply these different stories to our own lives the thought came to me that this whole book how blessed it is from Genesis to Revelation it's just about two people and the first the very how it starts that in the beginning God and it's about this God this ever existing one and how that there were it gave types and shadows and and it told us about that this one that was to come that was going to be God made flesh and he would make all the wrongs right and he would forgive all the sins and and he would he would be the hope of our salvation it's about that man from Genesis to Revelation it's about him but there's somebody else that this book is about from the same length from all the way from the beginning to the end and that's about me and that's about you so really there's two people that this Bible concentrates on it's the man that died on the cross the man that created the heavens and the Earth the man that promised that he's going to come back the man that wiped all of our sins away the man that is exalted into heaven the the he calls himself I am the alpha and I am the Omega I am the beginning and I am the end it's about him and then it's about me and how this book applies to my life and how he deals with me and my relationship with him and every Prophet that was in the Bible pointed at this man and pointed us to this man and said give your lives to this man serve this man serve this God you do it and I look and and and as I woke up last night and and started writing down on my phone the thought that I had and I believe that if it is there's two people and will we recognize God's kindness to us or will we ignore him and really just live a meaningless life I don't care how great you think you are I don't how great someone could be it's a meaningless life without Christ your life amounts to nothing without him but if you have him just like this sister I was talking about the sister that's there she is right there God bless bless you Sister Connie I'm sorry you were hiding I didn't want to say your name is it okay if I say who it was God bless your loyal heart sister Connie Williams I um you're a blessing and I I hope that um well I know I know that the Lord has touched your life and I know that sister Connie he's going to make a way every step of the way he'll be there for you and you know what you know who else is going to be there we're going to be there for you and we're going to be there with you God bless your heart and and and these this story it's about Connie Williams and Jesus Christ it's about Daniel Evans and Jesus Christ it's about you brother Emanuel and Jesus Christ it's about us and him one person one God and that relationship between the two and he will always make a way and we should be we should give him our gratitude otherwise our life is meaningless you can be we see all these famous people and and it's all dist stir with with the Elon musks and the Donald Trumps and all these different ones their lives are meaningless without Jesus Christ one soul is where 10,000 worlds wow I I appreciate what they're trying to do I do and I support them but what about the soul of a man what about the soul of a woman you know and you think about all these things going going on and it Narrows all the way down to a little Congregation of a couple hundred people and what that congregation is doing and how many Souls how many souls are in this building right now and they mean so much to God he we were in his thoughts before the foundation of the world and he wanted to form this world and he did he separated the light from the darkness he separated the the land from the sea he he made the clouds in the in the skies and he made the water on the earth and he made the fish and he made all the animals for what for his sons and his daughters he made it all for us and we can't give him enough enough thanks we cannot give him enough gratitude I asked Daniel to sing that song this morning gratitude which I just came to the pulpit with Lord I don't have anything to give you there's nothing I can give to you I I'm I'm nothing but I can give you a Hallelujah I can give you a thanks I can give you my love I can give you a clap offering and say Lord I love you so much and I'm so grateful we came through this this Thanksgiving holiday and and I always want to take a a few minutes to go back to our our founding fathers and what they did there was 102 of them on the ship that came across the Atlantic Ocean and they settled at Plymouth and and they they uh they had hard they H really hard and they gave what we call this Thanksgiving but this this Thanksgiving this wasn't new this Thanksgiving was what came from the Protestant Revival so many things I've been talking a lot about Martin Luther lately and so much came from him and what he did and standing against the Tyranny and saying that no these things are wrong and standing up for what was right and things like Thanksgiving came actually from him from that Protestant Revival it was all I'll read it it says a day of Thanksgiving might be held in response to the signs of God's mer Mercy such as rain allowing a good harvest arrival of needed supplies or recovery from sickness they might might also be held after a long period of General sickness or lack of disaster we look at our United States now it's been a long time we had covid a little while ago just prepping us maybe for for something that's to come on days of Thanksgiving the faithful would also spend the day in in church attendance would pray thankfully sing psalms of praise and feast Pur and feast days were more than more solemn and demanding than traditional Christian feasts days of Thanksgiving were celebrated with joy and thanks for recent blessings but Puritans also saw them as days to look forward to the com coming of the kingdom of God and that's what led this first Thanksgiving so they there was 102 of them I believe and they they arrived in America and then that first that first year they were dying over half of them died that first winter they struggled they struggled they they died of scurvy they died of malnutrition they died of exposure to the elements they lived on the ship for all that time the Indians God sent these Native Americans leprosy that we understand as leprosy or it could have been some sort of a contagious skin disease leprosy is used in the Bible uh not as a specific necessarily disease but as has a a broad contagious uh really Dreadful skin disease and so what Jesus was telling them he said now you go and you show yourselves to the priests and you wonder why did Jesus say for them to go and show themselves to the priests it wasn't to say hey go show yourselves to the priest and and so they can see that all I've done or they could see that all that God has done through my Ministry that was going to happen but there was a two-fold purpose to them going and showing themselves to the priest first it assured that the person who had that contagious skin disease was cured and and can't spread it to other people so in the Book of Leviticus a a leper would come to the priest after he was healed of of his disease he would come to the priest the priest would examine him and then it was like an 8-day process then the the priest would say go and do this ritualistic bathing and and that type of thing but it it made it to where this person could show Not only was he healed but he could show other people that he's healed and he could go back into the congregation because if he had leprosy he wasn't allowed in the congregation so this would allow this person back in and it may have been some sort of a notorized writing or something he went through here's your leprosy negative report you can go back to your family you can go back to church you can go back and and and and fellowship with um with everyone and and just assimilate back into society and second it allows that person to go back to work to start earning a living and to not be shunned and really third after they had showed themselves to the priest third it did show the glory of Jesus Christ because the priests would be witness to the this healing power that was from this man so this was following the word of God given to the Jewish people by Moses that would allow these men to assimilate back into societ iety after they had been cured of their disease and you'll notice in verse 12 it says that they stood a far off now it's probably because they had to keep their distance in order to keep the law because this was a contagious disease and then as I said after the ceremony they could come back so you can imagine the embarrassment that was on these 10 men and they cried out to Jesus they knew that he could heal the sick so they cried out Lord have mercy Jesus said now you go and show yourselves to the priest they had something to do they had to have faith that Jesus's words were going to be true he said now you go and show yourselves to the priest so they went and as they were following what Jesus said shows that we have to follow what Jesus says first and as they were following what Jesus said they were walking and they saw that their leprosy was gone this dreaded disease they were completely cured so they must have taken off running I want to get to the priest I want to get back into society I want to go have dinner with my family I don't want everybody to shun me and and and and just keep keep away from me I'm embarrassed by it and then as they were going there was one man that turned around let's go back to verse 13 and they lifted up their voices and they said Jesus Master have mercy on us and when he saw them he said unto them go show yourselves unto the priest and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed so Jesus tells them to do something they had Faith they did it before they were healed they followed what Jesus said they were healed and one of them when he saw that he was healed he turned back and with a loud voice glorify God how many times does the Lord do something for us and we forget to give him credit and it could be a small thing like Josiah like you with your truck the other night Josiah's truck wouldn't start it just turned off and young um Timmy Timmy Robson um Katie's brother he said a prayer that the that the Lord would heal the truck and then we got in there and we we cleaned some things cleaned some posts and it started up and ran fine what's the first thing we should we did was we bowed our heads and we thank God for what he did could it have been and Josiah asked could it have been the prayer or could it have been cleaning the the the battery posts it doesn't matter it was all God so if you brother Glenn if you go to the doctor and the doctor gives you some sort of a treatment and you get healed of your sickness or if you come to the Altar and you get healed of your sickness whichever one it's still God and God should be given the glory for it and these lepers as they went there was only one that turned around and with a loud voice voice glorified God and he fell down on his face at Jesus's feet giving him thanks and he was a Samaritan and Jesus and Jesus answering said we're not 10 cleansed but where are the nine there are not found that returned to give Glory save this stranger wow now a Samaritan we've heard the word Samaritan we know probably you probably understand that a Samaritan is a mixture of Jews and Gentiles these Samaritans go way back we've been talking in our Wednesday night bible study we've been concentrating on the Babylonian captivity and the dispersion of the Jews with Nebuchadnezzar and that so many things happened at that time many prophets prophesied during that time but even before that hundreds of years there was another Invasion by another Empire called the Sy Assyrian Empire they came in to the north of this country and they took captive those from Israel and they dispersed them out and that was the end of the country of Israel there was Israel in the north and Judah in the South that was the end of Israel and even they were gone until recently a few decades ago they came back so there were some people that stayed there and they mixed with the Gentiles so the Jews intermarried with the Gentiles way back during that Assyrian captivity and they formed the Samaritan people a mixture between Jews and Gentiles they followed all the way down Through the Ages and there was fighting between the Jews and the Samaritans the Jews thought they were were unclean because they didn't follow everything that the Jews thought they didn't have that purebred um lineage that the Jews had the Samaritans thought the Jews were wrong because it was like hey you guys left we stayed we're the real true ones from God so there was always this fighting and they didn't mix there was segregation back then and then Jesus is like look at all these other ones left and what comes back a Samaritan that's that's why it was so important that it was a Samaritan verse number 17 again and Jesus answering and said were not 10 cleansed but where are the nine there are not found that returned to give glory to God save this stranger and he said unto him arise go thy way thy faith has made thee whole the other ones got healed too I don't know if it it returned or what but but the Bible says that they were healed but this one person came back and Jesus recognized this one person that came back and gave thanks to God for the healing of his sickness there's a reason that it's put into the Bible Jesus appreciated the Gratitude Jesus Is God sir do you think God appreciates our gratitude and we can give him thanks for fixing a battery on a truck we can give him thanks for paying our bills we can give him thanks for healing us we can give him thanks for having a job we can give him thanks and you know what he appreciates it and here's God sitting on his throne and he's thousands of times every second I did this for this person I did this for this person I did this for this person I saved this person this person may be a Hindu this person may be a Buddhist I help them I helped them here I did this I did this and wow how many people really say thank you I cannot stand an ungrateful person it's something that gets really gets under my my skin and entitled person someone that that doesn't say thank you and I can imagine how God feels Jesus here himself it's like there was 10 of you one one person comes back to thank me wow one person comes back to give thanks to God I think nine out of 10 would be I mean one out of 10 would be a great success in today's society but it's one out of a million or one out of a 100 million it's very few that truly give thanks to God Billy Graham in 1952 I was surfing and uh saw this thing that he said he he was it was a Thanksgiving address and he said this he said the American people this year ought to be on their knees right now thanking almighty God for the tremendous and glorious blessings that were received this year and then he goes on to quote Luke 1248 which is to for whom much is given much is required so let's turn there Luke chapter 12 let's start with um 30 verse 39 and I'm going to read the the King James um the Old King James is hard to understand so put up the Old King James but I'm going to read the new King James um there's a few words in there that don't mean the same thing today so I'm going to read the new King James and you can follow along um if you want to look at the screen on the old King James but know this that if the Master of the House had known what hour the thief would come he would have watched and not allowed his house to be broken into therefore you also be ready for the son of man is coming at an hour that you do not expect then Peter said to him Lord do you speak this Parable only to us or do you speak it to all the people so he's like is this just special for us disciples or are you saying this to everyone and the Lord said I love the way Luke says the Lord said speaking of Jesus and the Lord said who then is that faithful and wise Steward whom in Master will make ruler over his household to give them their portion of food in due season blessed is that servant whom his master will find do so doing when he comes truly I say to you that he will make him ruler over all that he has but if that servant says in his heart my master is delaying his coming and begins to beat male and female servants and to eat and drink and be drunk the master of that servant will come on a day when he he's not looking for him and at an hour when he is not aware and will cut him in two and appoint him his portion with the unbelievers and that servant who knew his master's will and did not prepare himself or do according to his will shall be beaten with many stripes but he who did not know and yet committed things deserving of Stripes shall be beaten with a few so the one that knew better he's going to suffer more the one that didn't know better he's still going to suffer but he's not going to suffer as the as much as the one that knew better for everyone to whom much is given from him much will be required and to whom much has been committed of him they will ask the more so I ask in all of us have we seen the Lord working in our lives have you been introduced to A Jesus Christ that can do all things that he's not hindered by anything do you know do you truly know this one Jesus or do you just you hear about him but then we go along doing our thing we go along following our own mind and we forget to God to give God credit and we forget or don't even think or just willingly don't do what he said as I as I was talking about the Bible at the beginning have we not been given a Bible we've been given one and in today's society it's hard for the younger generation to sit down and read the book it's all right it's just the way putting the the the the phone in front of them it's it's hard to keep track and it's hard for them to focus so did he not he he gave you a Bible but but understand it's hard to read the Bible for some he gave you a Bible app so you can listen to it you're not limited to just the Bible he gave you the Bible in audio form if you don't like to read or you have trouble reading listen to it all of us have access to that that's right we need constant stimulation there's your stimulation listen to your Bible if you don't want to listen to it it's on YouTube too turn on YouTube and watch the Bible there's all kinds of good stuff on there but it's it's hard the devil throws all these things in front of us well we can turn our mind and God can take the things that the devil has put in front of us and then he can use him for his glory compare the time compare the time that we spend on our devices to the time that we spend on the things of the Lord now take your device and use it for the things of the Lord you can have you say well you know brother Daniel I read it and it's hard to understand he gave you all these other translations Now 50 60 years ago we just had the King James and maybe one other one now you have other translations that are just as accurate you can't you can't understand this one here you have other ones you know you have the English Standard Version is excellent you have the new King James version which is basically the King James that kind of takes out the these and the THS and changes some of the words that don't mean the same today as they did then and give we use the King James here but he gave you if you don't like it he gave you other ones Isaiah said when Satan comes in like a flood and he has then God will raise up a standard against him he comes in and he he distracts us with all these things God says okay I'm going to take that and I'm going to use it for my glory I'm going to take the internet I'm going to use it for my glory I'm going to take your phone I'm going to use it for my glory I'm going to take a book and I'm going to use it for my glory I'm going to take Sunday morning where you used to be doing something else and I'm going to use it for my glory I'm going to bring you into church let's read it Isaiah 59:19 says this so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west and and His glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him so when Satan comes in with all the distractions God raises up a standard against him by using the same vehicle of delivery for those distractions to give you salvation through his word and the Redeemer shall come to iion and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob sayeth the Lord as for me this is my Covenant with them sayeth the Lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which have which I have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed sayeth the Lord from henceforth and forever to quote another scripture he's talking about the word of God here and he's saying I'm going to put this he's telling Isaiah you tell them I'm going to put this to to give it to you and to your children and then this word is always going to be with you and it's never going to depart from you it'll stay in your mouth you'll be quoting it together as a family you'll be talking about it you'll be encouraging each other there's another scripture that says almost the same thing talking about the spirit of God that comes down and dwells in a in a person when they receive the Holy Spirit Peter said This Promise of the the holy spirit is to you to your children and to them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God so shall call that same spirit and here's Isaiah saying the same thing this word of God is going to be with you it's going to be comforting you all the time stay in it and when the enemy comes in like a flood and brings distractions on that don't worry God's going to raise up a standard against it use that standard don't try to force yourself into something that you can't do go ahead and use the gifts that God gave you you know we talk about going to church for those of you who have trouble coming to church I didn't go to church until I was 19 years old never went we stayed home we listened to a tape on a tape sermon on Sunday morning and that was it that was that was my word my aunt Jacqueline gave me a Bible when I was in fifth grade and I fell in love with it and I didn't understand a whole lot of it it was hard for me to understand but I I still read it and then later on we uh when I was 19 we started coming to church as a as a family just on Sunday morning and I I liked it man I liked being around the people so I started coming more and Stephanie and I we got married and we started coming and we never missed a service after that it was constantly all the time be just just taking in these blessings but you have to overcome you have to make an effort you have to make an effort to open your Bible you have to make an effort to come to church and sometimes it's it's hard but what better thing you going to do all the times I miss church I have no I can't remember what I did I can guess you know something but the times I went to church I remember it was a blessing we can skip church we can miss church believe me you're not going to remember that football game for for years to come it's not important but something may happen in church that is important even even when I was part of a church that there was a lot of turmoil even in all that turmoil I was still blessed to be there I still was better off going than not going and as I said we can complain about church and I can't stand a complainer you know I don't want to go to church the services are too long I got so many things I need to do you know what's more important what's more important than this soul and what's more important than the souls of the people here you say I don't like going to church I have a I I can't get up early I have too many things to do well what about the person that you come in and you can be a blessing too it's not always about you and thank the Lord that we have a place thank the Lord that you have a job I hear people complaining all the time I can't stand my job I hate getting up early I hate working hard I don't like the people I work with but you have a job you have an income thank God there's many that don't you're able to get an income I've talked to many people many a few that they can't get a legitimate job because they're not citizens of the country wonderful people that aren't legally allowed to do it you know what they would give to have what you have to have what I have and then we would complain about our job Paul said in Philippians 4:11 he says this not that I speak in respect of want I have learned in whatsoever State I am therewith to be content I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound everywhere in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need I can do all things through Christ which strengthen is me good or bad I'm not going to complain is what Paul's saying if the situation gets really bad I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me no matter what it is I can do it God's with me I want to I'm going to devote the rest of the service to I want to read some of my favorite scriptures we talk about Thanksgiving we talk about how how good God is and and we can get around the supper table and and than and just just go over about how how many wonderful blessings that he has to us but the biggest blessing in my life brothers and sisters is this book because John said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God this book is God in letter form and it is a lamp to our feet Psalm 119 says this 11 191 three the inspiration on the psalmist how sweet are thy words unto my taste sweeter than honey to my mouth though though thy precepts through thy precepts I get understanding therefore I hate every false way Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my P path I have sworn and I will perform it that I will keep thy righteous judgments I am Afflicted very much Quicken Me Lord Lord what does that mean make me alive Lord according to Thy word he says your word Lord It's a lamp to my feet it's like walking around in the desert there's Cactus everywhere and it's dark you're walking around you're going to get stuck you're going to fall in a hole you're going to fall off a cliff but Lord your word lights it up and I can see where I'm going and I can stay on the path that is what your word means to me Lord proverbs 31 says this my son forget not my law the word the law is the word but let thine heart keep my Commandments for length of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee let not mercy and Truth forsake thee bind them about my neck write them upon the table of thine heart I love that part so shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God God and in man and man trust in the Lord with all thine heart lean not unto thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy paths it's lighting up acknowledge the Lord and then he'll direct your path put him first give him praise give him thanks and he will point you in the right direction Colossians 3:16 Says this let the word of Christ dwell in you richly and all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord Daniel I I appreciate so much Daniel will sit down and and just start playing his guitar and we'll start singing and it's such a it's such a glorious time just the two of us was singing in the Lord and giving him praises and whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him wherever you go wherever you walk do it in the name of the Lord Jesus ask yourself this qu question and I promise you you'll never make a mistake you'll never do something wrong would Jesus do this would Jesus say this would Jesus Act this way do all in the name of the Lord Jesus can you do what you are doing in the name of the Lord Jesus and can you give thanks to God and the father for what you've just done Psalm 37 verse 5 commit thy way unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass brothers and sisters these words are the words of God they're more real than you are they're more real than I am this is God speaking this is his Bible commit thy way unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass that should lift our faith Jeremiah 23 this is one of my favorite verses Jeremiah 23:23 says this am I am I a god at hand sayeth the Lord and not a god a far off so am I a God that's close or am I a god that's way way off I think he's a god close brothers and sisters and he's as close as we bring him can any hide himself in a secret in secret places that I shall not see him sayeth the Lord do not I fill Heaven and Earth sayeth the Lord do not I fill Heaven and Earth this is the one that's got like a hundred million angels singing praises to him every every moment and he says do not I fill the Heaven and the Earth and you can ask me Joshua 1 verse 6 Moses had died Joshua was taking up his mantle the Lord says be strong and of of a good courage For unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear under the fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law the word which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left hand that thou mayest Prosper wherever thou go don't turn from the word stay in the word and you will prosper this book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth you're always talking about it but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and thou shalt have good success notice he said you will make make your way prosperous you will make your way prosperous how could he say that have not I commanded thee be strong and be of be of good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee wherever thou goest he's with you and you will make your way prosperous you have something to do believe on this word act on this word do this word word again these are just some of my favorite scriptures I want to give the Lord praise to them Isaiah 40: 29 he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and they shall not faint imagine Romans 15:1 says this we then that are strong ought to Bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves we're to help other people out brothers and sisters we're to carry their burdens for them let every one of us please his neighbor for his good edification for even Christ pleased not himself but as it is written the reproaches of them that reproach thee fell on me for whatsoever things were written a for time were written for our learning he's saying this Bible was written for us that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope 1 Corinthians 16 verse 13 watch ye stand steadfast in the faith quit you like men be strong let all your things let all things be done with Charity let me read the English Standard Version of that listen to this Be watchful stand firm in the faith act like men be strong let all that you do be done in love I love that part act like a man that's right be a man brother Amos be a man be strong stand up this word says it you know what I'm going to believe it that's right I'm going to take this word as it says it and I'm going to do it be a man and let it all be done in love Amos is a Fighter beat him up in love bro Nehemiah chapter 8 I love this verse 10 then he said unto them go your way eat the fat and drink the sweet I'm gonna read the English Standard Version um Nehemiah 8:10 then he said to them go your way eat the fat drink the sweet wine and send portions to anyone who has nothing ready for this day is Holy to our Lord and do not be grieved for the joy of the Lord is your strength you can be strong have joy in the Lord this word promises it so have joy in that it promises I want to skip down oh I have so many um but we're running it out of time musicians come 2 Corinthians 4 let's go to Psalm 46 Psalm 46 ver one says this God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble therefore will we will not we fear though the Earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea through the waters thereof though the waters thereof Roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with swelling thereof Sila there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God the holy place of the Tabernacles of the most high God is in the midst of her she shall not be moved God shall help her and that right early the Heathen raged the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice and the Earth melted the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge Sila come Behold The Works of the Lord what desol ations hath he made in the earth he maketh Wars to cease under the end of the Earth he breaks the bow he cuts the spear in Sun in Sunder he burns The Chariot in fire be still and know that I am God I will be exalted among the Heathen that he that word heathen means the Nations I will be exalted among the Nations I will be exalted in the Earth the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge Psalm 34 said this poor man cried and the Lord heard him saved him out of his troubles the angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear Him and delivers them oh taste and see that the Lord is good blessed is the man who takes refuge in him oh fear the lord all you Saints for those who fear Him have no lack verse 15 the eyes of the Lord are towards the righteous and his ears are towards their cry that's us his eyes are watching us and he's listening son daughter just tell me what you need I'm here acknowledge [Music] me let's close with Romans chapter [Music] 8 start with verse 26 likewise the spirit also helps our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself Mak his intercessions for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the spirit because he makes intercessions for the Saints according to the will of God and and we know that all things work together for the good for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them also he also called and to whom he called them also just he also Justified and to him he justified he also [Music] glorified skip to verse 33 listen close who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yay rather is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also makes intercession for us whenever we have a problem there is Jesus Christ right there interceding between us and the father who shall separate us from the love of Christ who shall separate me from the love of Jesus Christ who shall separate you from the love of Jesus Christ shall tribulation shall distress persecution famine nakedness Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ
