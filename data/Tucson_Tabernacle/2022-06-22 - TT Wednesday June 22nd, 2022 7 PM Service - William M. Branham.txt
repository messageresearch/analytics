has come the holy ghost from heaven the father promised the tidings round [Music] wherever man is [Music] let's go back to the previous verse there i like that i a child of hell i was reading something that martin luther said he said when i look at myself i said how can i be saved but when i look at what he's done i said how can i but be saved what a promise we have from god today it's the comforter has come i just just want to can't just go to the next verse there brother [Music] sing till the echoes fly [Music] above the faltered [Music] of endless love [Music] has come the comforter has come the comforter has come the holy [Music] wherever [Music] [Music] how many can testify that how do you know he lives he lives in me amen uh just a couple of requests brother lyle if he would come up and take these uh sister holly had put in a request you may have seen it today that the company she works for in the hospital is going out of business but somebody is possibly buying that company and just asking that the lord's will would be done and sometimes when we look at of ourselves and we say lord how am i going to do without this but he's a god that supplies every need my daughter naomi has been working at pima college through the bookstore for quite a few years and they just recently got bought out by barnes and noble and they're interviewing all the current employees and telling there's a possibility that they could keep their jobs under the new company so god is still able and he still meets every need so we have a praise also my wife had put in a prayer request for her nephew jared valenzuela he was released from the hospital two days after being admitted to icu with complications of diabetes so he's we've been released and he's home now but continuing to pray for jared's salvation along with mom and brother's salvation so this is my wife's youngest sister's family so and brother lyle can share with about his son joel as here and he'll let you know and if he would come just i just want to praise the lord uh last friday afternoon my son our son joel was in florida with his family and they were doing some boating stuff and as he was parking the boat at the dock he put his hand up to you know kind of ease it into the dock and a wave came and picked up the boat and slammed it into his finger it could have been his hand but it smashed and severed and i guess a fish ate the last inch of his finger and he was obviously in quite a lot of pain um but uh asked for prayer here from uh from a few folks and joel came back from florida monday he was able to have surgery done here in tucson and he just thanks the lord that all is going well with that and that uh he you know his attitude is that there's a purpose in everything god has a purpose for this and somehow god is going to get glory there's going to be some positive thing that comes from the loss of that finger so i i just thank everyone for their prayers i thank god for watching over my son that it wasn't his hand or his wrist that that boat prowl penetrated and that his attitude is so so positive and so gracious let's take these requests to the lord now in prayer because we know that god answers our prayers he hears our prayers he's not deaf he hears we don't have to shout we don't have to to do something to get his attention because he loves us and he dwells within us lord jesus we are so grateful that we can be here this evening gathered amongst precious brothers and sisters of like precious faith lord we just raise our hands to you we're in awe of you lord of your grace and your mercy your love your kindness your compassion your patience lord as as our brother just said about how can i possibly be saved but then when we look at what you've done how can we not

accept our praise lord at each of these requests that have been made lord we pray that you would reach down lord in your mercy that you'd answer each one lord just as we're grateful for the the

may be seated my sister hope buckles hasn't a song special that she'll prepare a couple of announcements i don't know if you've heard our brother joel dalton passed away brother jim ed's brother part of the group i believe that was up in prescott and brother tom weathers sent this down saying the memorial service will be on july 9th at 1 pm at trinity heights methodist church in flagstaff for the dalton family and remembering them and the church up in flagstaff and all that areas we think well they lived a long and good life and all but still there's a loss so just remember them and then also spoke with brother mike patterson be a brother tom weathers because he'd been helping brother mike patterson after after brother mike had that stroke or what he had and they've actually closed down the church that was brother mike's he was not able to and in closing down the church brother mike's desire was all the other churches could have something from the church that they could use and brother tom said every every one of the churches in the phoenix area and all were able to either get some pews some music even a little pentecostal church down the street that needed some pews so and brother mike had been having he could read but he was not able to comprehend what he was reading for a while there and of course that would be extremely disappointing but his daughter sister rachel shared with brother tom that he's beginning to comprehend again and understand what he's reading and maybe it's something we take for granted until we can't do it or don't have it but thank the lord of the the good report we have but keeping him in in prayer and also the flagstaff meetings coming up july 22nd which is friday and then on saturday and and sunday with services brother aaron mcgary

name your holy [Music] love is [Music] amen lord we just as we prepare to listen lord to the discernment of spirit a message spoken some almost 60 years ago now but you're still the same yesterday today and forever lord father you desire that our hearts would be just completely laid open to you lord and let you do that work in us father as you minister to us in your word we ask lord that we can yield to it lord and you would have your own way in jesus christ's name amen god bless you as we listen you may be seated our heavenly father i want to express if i can this morning how in my heart i feel towards one the holiest of holy coming down to the earth and to redeem a sinner like myself and i'm sure that these ministers it's present now can feel the same way that it was by your grace that we have been made the ministers of this covenant that thou has given with adam's fallen race and we are here this morning father gathered for no other purpose but to know and to s to study to know rather the will of god and what we must do to make christ real to the people of this generation knowing surely that in the day of the judgment we will be brought face to face with this generation and being ministers we will be judges and the people to which we have spoken to and their attitude towards the word that we bring them will determine their eternal destination therefore lord in that day we would be a judge far our against the generation that we preach to father god please through jesus name let us not say one word that would be wrong but may we have sincere hearts and open minds that we might receive the things that's yours that we might be able to go out into our different fields of work after today and and be better equipped because of our meeting with you this morning granted lord won't you come and be our speaker and our ears and our tongue and our thoughts let the meditation my heart thoughts of my mind all that is within me and within these my brethren and sisters may it be acceptable in thy sight lord that we might be so filled in charge with thy spirit of your presence here that the room would become the room not so much the building that we are sitting in but the building that we are living in become all together a cloud of the glory of god we might leave here this morning so fill with the holy spirit that we would be more determined than ever before in life to carry the message to the dying generation that we're living in hear us lord and speak to us through thy word for we asked it in the name of thy son and our savior jesus christ amen i wish to read this morning um a portion of scripture found in the psalms the uh hundred and fifth psalm i wish to read just the potion you that keeps down these scripture readings i see many of them and we're ministers and so forth it's good to read the word and now what time did they usually psalms 105 o give thanks unto the lord call upon his name make knowing his deeds among the people sing unto him saying psalms unto him talk ye of all his wondrous works glory in his holy name let the hearts of them rejoice that seek the lord seek the lord and his strength seek his face evermore remember his marvelous works that he has done his wonders and the judgments of his mouth oh ye seed of abraham his servants ye children of jacob is chosen he is the lord our god his judgments are in all the earth he has remembered his covenant forever the words which he commanded to a thousand generations which covet he made with abraham and his oath unto isaac and confirmed the same unto jacob for our law and to israel for an everlasting covenant saying unto thee will i give the land of canaan the lot of your inheritance when they were but a few man in number yeah very few and strangers in it when they went from one nation to another and from one kingdom to another people he suffered no man to do them wrong yea he reproved kings for their sake saying touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm may the lord bless the reading of his words i have a few scriptures written out here somewhere that i was going to refer to perhaps along the road i wonder today who's going to be the next president the election is coming up you know who's going to be president this next term what if i knew there's only one that does know and that's god and what if god would reveal to me who's going to be the next president and i stood here in phoenix and made a prediction that such and such a man would be the next president of the united states and they would place that in papers and so forth and i would hit it right on the dot it would be perfect and it would be all that i had said would come to pass but what good would it do what good is it anyhow if i if i should do such a thing the papers would advertise it and it would go out maybe if such a person could make such a prediction and it would be true all the newspapers and magazines would would pass on it but you know that god doesn't do things like that god doesn't use his power and his gifts for foolishness it's going to be whatever is president it'll be president and to know now which would be president wouldn't help us one penny it wouldn't do us one bit of good to know who's going to be president so therefore god doesn't do those things like that and then if i made such a prediction as that and it come to pass and the newspapers packed it and the magazines then it would be to my glory people would say look what a great prophet brother branham is he told us long before it happened just who would be president and that would be to my glory but god doesn't want he's not interested in working things to my glory or to to any other man's glory he's interested to work things to his glory something that will profit like paul said if we speak with tongues and do not have an interpreter what good does it do we only glorify ourselves and that's uh edify ourselves that's uh connie out of the line for god god wants to be edified himself and we're to not seek self edification but to edify god with all we do so therefore i believe this morning if i knew who he would be and exactly when he would be elected and all how many votes he'd be over under or whatever it might be it wouldn't do one bit of good to tell it it'd be best for me just to keep it still if i did know it not try to publish it because there would be there would be no reason for me to do it because it's going to be anyhow and it doesn't make us that much difference uh who's going to be president but god when he uses his gifts he uses them for his own glory and for the glory of his people for the glory of his church for the edifying of the body of christ and for the glory of the kingdom of god that's why he gives these things in his church why yes teachers prophets evangelists pastors they are for the edification of the church and for the glory of god the prophet is not to get out and mingle with the world and try to take a gift like balaam did and make havoc or or money out of it or something if he's a prophet he's supposed to reveal god to the church and stay out of the things of the world it's all for the glory of god now we do have and i think it's a good thing for us as ministers to follow our order when we see such things in the world as we see today and we have an order from god is for the discerning of spirits trying the spirit i believe that that is a very great lesson for the church today is to try the spirit of anything have discernment of the spirit i do not think that we should ever by any means ever try to judge a person by the denomination they belong to or by the group that they are assembled with whether they be methodist baptist presbyterian pentecostal or whatever they are we should never judge the man by the denomination that he belongs to we should always judge him by the spirit he has seen the spirit whether he's a latter rain or farmer rain or inner outer rain or no rain or whatever it might be we should never judge him by that but by his spirit we are to discern spirits watch what the man has in mind what he has what he's trying to achieve if the man by a gift no matter how great the gift is now i want to get this to the church this morning which into the different denominations you are still the church of the living god together and this is the thing i want to get to you see that we are really not divided we are the stones that's cut in different forms all to the glory of god now there is so much in the day that we live in pertaining to gifts so many people judge people by gifts that they have well i believe that these things are gifts i believe that what we see take place is gifts and they're god-given gifts but we if we do not use them in the right way that god intended them to be used then we can do more harm with the gifts than we could if we did not have the gifts the other night i made a statement at the pulpit saying this that i would rather see brotherly love existing among the church if we didn't have one case of healing or anything else we must know what these things are for now if a man comes and he has a great gift no matter if he belongs to our denomination or another denomination don't judge him by what denomination he come from how he dresses but what you want to see is what he's trying to do with that gift what purpose he has if he's trying to take his influence and build himself a great name out of it i'd have discernment of spirit enough to know that's wrong no matter how great her teacher he is how powerful he is how intellectual he is or how his gift operates if he isn't trying to achieve something for the benefit of the body of christ your own spiritual discernment would tell you that that's wrong no matter how accurate how perfect how it is it's wrong if it isn't used for the body of jesus christ to achieve something maybe he's got a great gift that he could draw people together with a great intellectual or a spiritual power that he could draw people together and maybe he's trying to take that gift and make himself famous so he'll have a big name so that other brethren will look up to him as some big person then that's wrong amen maybe he's trying to to edify a certain thing here that he wants everybody else to get out of the picture and let him and his group be the picture that's still wrong but if he has a gift of god and he's trying to edify the body of christ then i don't care what he belongs to you're not discerning the man you're discerning the spirit the life that's in the man and that's what god told us to do not one time was we ever commissioned to discern the uh the man's group but we was uh constrained and commanded by god to discern the spirit in the man what he's trying to do what the spirit in his life is trying to lead him to and then if we can find out that he's trying to lead the people not to break them up but to bring them together and to bring the church of the living god not all to one denomination but to an understanding a fellowship a unity of spirit then if he is former rain or latter rain or whatever it is his spirit and his purpose is right and the spirit that's in him no matter what move he belongs to the spirit that's in him is trying to part the people to calvary away from himself or away from anything else but his only achievement he has is to point them to calvary he doesn't care whether he's even knowed or not he doesn't care whether he's even his own movement which is fine see it's good if he is a methodist or a presbyterian or a roman catholic or whatever he wants to be by denomination but what is he trying to do the purpose of his heart that he's trying to get then you can see what's in the man's life whether his motives as far as his denomination whether it's for his self whether it's for worldly fame whether it's for big names to say i predicted that come just exactly to pass now i see that's wrong right there to begin with but if he's trying to use what god's given as a teacher as a prophet as a seer a new testament prophet is a preacher we all know that just any minister that's a preacher is a prophet a new testament prophet if he's prophesying preaching not to try to edify himself to make a big name or to edify his organization which he should be in an organization here i am without one but yet preaching you should be that's right every man ought to have a church home you ought to have a place not just to float about from pillar to post but have somewhere that you go to church and you call it your church somewhere you pay your tithes and somewhere that you help support the cause take your choice but then don't never disfellowship the other man because he don't belong with your group see discern his spirit and see if he's got the same purpose in heart then you've got fellowship one with another you're working for one great cause that's the cause of christ i think that is absolutely true now if we will notice the motives and objectives of the old testament prophets them man had one objective that was jesus christ they had one thing that their whole theme of the old testament was built around the coming messiah they they did not go out and do things just for money or for fame they had one thing they were anointed with the spirit of god and they predicted the coming messiah and those men were so anointed with the spirit until they sometimes acted like the spirit that was within them they spoke seemingly of themselves watch how the spirit of god made that man act we'll take for instance moses the great prophet how that that man had no selfish objectives at all he could have been the king of egypt he could have had the world under his feet but because that he was a prophet at heart he refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer the persecution and the trials of christ esteeming the treasures of heaven greater treasures than them of egypt he forsook and denied himself of the worldly fame of the luxury and the the things that life offers he had to look beyond that see he could have been that just take the minister today if he has the baptism of the holy spirit and he knows that if he preaches that word it's going to cut his fame down it's going to put him in a little bitty church somewhere or maybe out on the street but he knows that something in his heart is burning he sees the coming of the lord he doesn't care whether that he has a big church or a little church he doesn't care whether he has today's food or not no food he doesn't care whether he has good clothes or doesn't have good clothes he's only mindful of one thing and that's the very life within him crying out he's trying to achieve something for the glory of god and that man in doing so will act the very life of the spirit that's in him do you follow me he'll act it out look at moses when he come to a time that he displayed all his life was the spirit of christ for christ was in him christ was in moses by measure now if we notice he was born in the time of persecution the children was killed to try to get him just exactly like they did uh jesus and we find out that when it come to a place that the children of israel had disobeyed in such a way until god was angry with them and he said to moses step aside and i'll destroy the whole group of them and i'll take of you and raise up another generation moses chew himself in the path of god's judgment and said take me before you take them in other words before you can get them you'll have to come over me that's exactly what jesus christ did when god would have wiped the whole face of the earth off with these sinners you and i but christ threw yourself in the path god could not do it he couldn't come over his own son and when god seen that spirit in moses hanging in the judgment like a crosser you can't come to him you'll have to take me first see the spirit of god in moses when he could have been king of egypt when he could have had every luxury in the world to be popular when he could have been the great king of the world at that time but he chose to suffer the persecutions and the affliction for he esteemed the reproach of christ greater treasures and that of egypt amen you see he threw his self in a way why it was god in moses did that the normal thinking intellectual man would never do that he would take the easy road so no matter how much a fanatic moses seemed to be he was trying you see he was a true prophet of god because he was trying to achieve something for the kingdom of god now with his great gift of prophecy he might have been a wise man could have stood up in egypt and said now wait i'll prophesy so and so i'll say so and so and as with his prophecy but in in all he had been world famous but if that wasn't in his heart it couldn't be in his heart so if you see a person with a great gift trying to do something to glorify themselves your own discernment of the spirit tells you that's wrong but moses was trying to achieve something for the glory of god no matter how bad it was how evil it looked how much it was talked about the spirit in moses directed him straight to the line of duty the spirit in him look at joseph joseph was when he was born he was loved of the father and hated by his brethren perfect type of christ and the only he was a blood brother to them the same father but the reason his brethren hated him was about a cause because god had made him a prophet spiritual a seer and they hated him for that very purpose but joseph could not help it because god had made him that way and what's the spirit of god in joseph watch what he did he even acted the part of christ he was hated of his brethren loved of his father because of the spirit made the difference he was a spiritual man he saw visions he interpreted dreams he did not do it for his own glory he did it because there was something in him the spirit of god he wouldn't have went out there by his own self and have been thrown into a ditch and have his poor old father to grieve all those years sold for nearly 30 pieces of silver taken up from the ditch and became the right-hand man of pharaoh the king of earth at that time and in his prison house there was a butler and a baker and one was lost and the other was saved by his prediction in the prison house and did you notice jesus when he came he was loved of the father and the father gave joseph a coat of many colors the rainbow a covenant and the father god gave his son jesus the covenant and then the jewish brother hated him without a cause he had no reason to hate him he was spiritual and he was god's word made manifest he come to do the will of the father he come to fulfill the scriptures he came to bring them peace but they misunderstood him and hated him without a cause they didn't stop to try to see what he was trying to achieve they just judged him because he didn't agree with them they may he makes himself so and so he makes himself god he was god god was in him the bible said god was in christ manifesting himself to the world he was the god of glory manifesting the glory of god amen look at moses he couldn't help throwing himself there he didn't do that hypocritically he did it because god was in him neither could joseph help being what he was because it was god in him working or displaying himself through the man never did he do it for self glory any man that if those priests would only have the discernment of spirit as i'm speaking to you this morning regardless of how much the world talked about him they still would have known if they'd look to the word if they were seeing his purpose he was always doing that to glorify the father he said they said oh this man's a great healer he does these things like that he said i can do nothing till the father shows me it is not me that doeth the works it's the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works he never took the glory neither would any servant of god take glory neither would any servant of god take a gift of god and try to glorify himself or anything else but his right achievement is to do something to the glory of god that's why i see the same thing today we must have discernment of spirit to see a person what they're trying to do are they trying to glorify god are they trying to glorify themselves now the spirit of god working in man makes man act like god no wonder jesus said is not it written ye are gods and if they call them gods to whom the spirit of god came to how can you condemn me that when i am the son of god if you could see the spirit of god in moses which he was god moses was a god joseph was a god the prophets were gods the bible said they were yes they were gods because they had completely surrendered themselves to the spirit of god that they were working for the glory of god and when a man is so anointed with the spirit i'll let this go real deep under the fifth rib on the left side when a man is anointed of the spirit of god his habits his actions and everything is god moving in him sometimes he's misjudged look at david in the 23rd psalm he cried my god my god why has thou forsaken me as if he was if david was the man all they that passed me by shoot their lip out at me he was so anointed with god he was so perfectly surrendered to god and the anointing was on him in such a way and when he cried by the spirit of god if somebody been standing there say well look he thinks somebody shoot their lip out at him why is god forsaken him it wasn't david it was a spirit crying out through david amen my god my god why has i forsaken me my bones all stare at me they have pierced my hands and my feet well somebody said listen to that hypocrite up there whose hands is pierced whose feet is pierced that's the intellectual but one who had discernment of spirit knew that that was the spirit of god in him crying out when a man is anointed of the spirit of god he's got the action of god and the action of god is never to break us up the action of god is to draw us together for we are one in christ jesus and god's purpose is to bring us together love one another now that great prophets we see the spirit moving in them jesus called them gods he said they were gods now when the spirit come to them by measure but when he come on the one jesus which was the son of god it come to him without measure the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt in him for he was the perfect example he was god of glory manifesting the glory of god to the people god in him going about watch his life all the old testament he was the theme of the old testament all the old prophets back in the old testament cried out not to themselves they cried out under the spirit of god making them act like god in so much that they were called gods and then the fullness of that spirit was manifested in jesus christ look at david when he was dethroned as the king of israel rejected by his own people going up mount olives north of jerusalem and he looked back over the city and wept because he was rejected what was it it was the spirit of christ 500 years later the son of david jesus sat on the same mount looking over the city as a rejected king and cried jerusalem jerusalem off what i have gathered you your different denominations and everything as a hindus are brood but you would not how often i have did it now the same spirit that was in david that was manifested in fullness in christ is in the church today crying to the peoples how oft would i have gathered you and when you see separations and and differences and and brotherhood broken up and christian life one against the other then it makes the spirit of god in your heart cry out you're trying to achieve something a true prophet of god a true teacher is trying to bring the church to a unity of spirit a unity of spirit that they might recognize god trying to achieve it no matter what denomination they belong to or what about it we have discernment of spirit to discern the spirit that's in the man to see if it be the spirit of god or not now we noticed when he was here on earth i went about doing good i noticed another thing that come to my mind did you notice when david was rejected as king he went out of the city and a little benjamin mine benjamin which was supposed to have been a brother to him should have been sorry because he was rejected but what he was a crippled man and he drug along there with his crippled condition throwing dirt on david and calling him all kinds of bad names and cursing him in the name of the lord cursing king david in the name of the lord this little crippled up vengeance watch the spirit of god in the spirit of the devil working now if you notice he was crippled it represents the spiritual crippledness of the people today that would make fun of the true spirit of god in christ manifesting itself that was the spirit of christ and david being rejected as a king and today when the people make fun of the people who has received the holy spirit and trying to achieve something to draw methodists and pentecostals and baptists and pentecostals and presbyterians and all together as a unity as a body of christ and they see the spirit work you say well look that's a pentecostal away with him i know one went off with another man's wife i know this and got drunk i know this one did this i know this and did that all that but they're big enough to hide their own things they can hide it but david was exposed wow he had the spirit of christ in him that guard said shall i take the head of that dog that would curse my king what's the spirit of christ and david let him alone for the lord has told him to curse me do you catch that let him alone the lord has told him to curse me instead today we don't get up our fist and fight him chop his head off yeah get him out he don't belong to us let him on the lord has told him to curse me that little run along earth throwing dirt on david that's what they do today on the spirit of christ they're a bunch of holy rollers but they're a bunch of this there's nothing to them there's nothing to divine healing there's no such thing as angels there's no such thing as prophets all those things the days of miracles has passed through a dirt but let them on but when david returned in power hallelujah when he come back as full king of israel don't worry this jesus whose spirit we have today acted his part i will return again in a physical body a second time in glory and power and majesty that little dirt thrower fell on his face and beg for mercy so let him alone the spirit of christ in us don't excommunicate him let's remember that all these things has got to come to pass we've got one thing to do move on god promised that he'd make everything work together for good to them that love him let's keep the discernment of the spirit keep the objective right we're here to serve god each one fellowshipping going along and serving god if the man's got the wrong kind of an objective then what will happen see now we find out that the spirit of god was in him all the old prophets spoke of him all the spirits in potion every little potion wasn't glorifying itself true prophets all the true prophets was manifesting him speaking of him and everything they said was fulfilled in him showed it was the spirit of god in them it was fulfilled what was it god speaking of himself see god manifesting himself through these prophets not taking glory he'll be the next president who will be this and hit you your head tell us who hit you and we'll believe you that isn't it it's something to manifest god it isn't something to make brother weather share our brother shores or brother uh so and so out there a great man make him a greater than the rest of the man of his group make him the greatest man in phoenix he is going to make william branham something great but what is to do it is to make oral robbers something great billy graham something great but it's our hearts we're trying to achieve something for the kingdom of god it's manifesting god all gifts and things doesn't make one greater than the other it just makes us all working together for the perfection of the body to bring us together as one people as a people of god but when you see them going contrary don't curse them just let them alone somebody has to do it but wait till jesus comes in power now we see all those prophets speaking every one of them was glorifying god and the coming messiah and when they got in the spirit they acted and spoke and lived the life out just like the messiah did if it did that side the cross speaking of his coming how much more will it after his coming will put the spirit of the messiah in the church to act do work and live like the messiah it's the spirit of god discern that spirit see whether it is of god or not see whether it acts like him see if your emotions if somebody kicks up something against you and throws dirt upon your life when you know you're as innocent as you can be and you know what you've got the spirit of god don't try to separate yourself don't try to act mean towards him don't curse him just walk on knowing god did that to give you a test to see how you take it he'll have to come to it anyhow as i said the other day i believe in brother fuller's church of the bicycle rider in canada well all of them thought they could out ride this boy this little old and he's the only one couldn't hire right without holding the handlebars i'm glad i like to be one of those handlebar riders take a hold of both sides of the cross and say nothing in my arms i bring let me hold to the cross lord i have no intellectuals i have nothing let me just hold here look way out down there and they had a 12 inch plank to ride for a city block to get a 100 schwinn bicycle all those boys you could ride without holding go downtown get their mother's groceries and come back without even touching the handlebars they everyone began to look they wasn't used to holding to the handle of ours and they fell off but this little boy got on there and helped the handle of ours and wrote it to the end they asked himself how did you do it he says here's where you make your mistake fellas you're all better writers than i am but you were looking here and said it made you nervous to see what you're trying to balance yourself and you fell off said i never looked here at all i watched the end and it's kept steady that's what we're to do don't look at these little things now did this one do this or that one do that watch the end and keep studying christ is coming watch the end just keep studying don't notice what's going on now watch what's going to go on out down there at the end time when we're going to have to stand and give an account for our lives david wasn't watching that little benjamin throw dirt on him he's crippled anyhow he never noticed him he wouldn't even let the guard cut his head off today him alone god told him to do that god told him to curse me let him alone or david knew that someday he was returning in power that benjamin did have his time yes that's it the church will rise and triumph i just sent to pray for his sick children anyhow that's all i can do wherever they are and what church they are it makes me no different i'm trying to pray for his sick children trying to manifest the gift for his glory that's reason i never did belong to anything now remember that's all right see i'm not i'm not saying that now i want you to get it clear i believe that god's got christians in every church his children he's never questioned me on that i just have to pray for the children and to do these things and to manifest him now you see jesus and these prophets everything that they spoke of had to be true for it was the power of god in them god himself speaking through them of his own self-coming to his own glory who's president who's gonna is they go to uh are we gonna have enough rain this year i don't mean nothing something to the glory of god something to set the church in order something for the power of god not to make yourself a name but to make the glory of god manifested now we notice that all those prophets and all they said about him everything come to true because he was the theme of the old testament jesus the messiah coming messiah was what every prophet looked from from adam to my malachi every prophet spoke of the coming of the lord each one put his part in because he was anointed of god that's all he could speak of now wish we had more time on it but watch everything that they said come to pass lookie here let's just take some of the things that the prophet said a virgin shall conceive and bear a child did it happen sure his name shall be called emmanuel uh prince of peace mighty god everlasting father that's what he was exactly the everlasting father no man shall be called father on this earth but god is your father all right now let's see again he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity the chaste of our peace upon him with his stripes we were healed pilate's judgment hall while the very man having his back length like that with a catalyzed tail whip didn't realize that the scripture said it would be that way they didn't have discernment of spirit those priests who sat away with him away with him and on the cross when he shot out their lips and things like that when he heard him crying my god why is that forsaking me they didn't have discernment see they couldn't discern the spirit that's what david was speaking of in the 22nd psalm they shot out their lip not knowing they were doing it just the same as that benjaminite did to david see he thought david was all wrong because he didn't agree with him on his principles of running his kingdom he didn't understand that it was the spirit of god and david doing it that's where we must discern today the spirit of the man what's he trying to do what's he getting at not what group he belongs to or what this that or the other whether he's a white man black man yellow man or whatever he is let's see what he's trying to achieve and take that see what he's trying to do for the kingdom of god he's got odd ideas to ours that's perfectly all right if he's trying to achieve something for the kingdom of god discern that in him if he's wrong and true in heart god will bring him around to the truth of the thing after a while let him alone let him alone see what he's trying to do now we see here then we find out in his in his death when he died at the cross and crying all the things the prophet spoke of him they pierced my hands and my feet there it was fulfilled the prophets was right they thought it was themselves or cried like it was themselves but it was manifested in the cross he uh he was uh numbered with the transgressors that's what he was done he was with the transgressors in his death he made his bureau with the rich he did he was buried in a rich man's grave i will not leave his soul he will not leave my soul said david the spirit of god in david speaking out he will not leave my soul in hell neither will he suffer his holy one to see corruption like as if david would be the holy one it wasn't david it was the spirit of god in david crying out see the spirit of god in the man crying out some of them said listen that old hypocrite up there he wasn't it was the spirit of god in him crying out see the spirit of god manifests itself not leave his soul in hell neither will suffer my holy one to see corruption now brethren and closing may i say this our time gets away but look may i say this in closing with these scriptures here let's see if a man that all the old testament theme was about him all the holy prophets anointed with god's spirit if all that and everything that they said was fulfilled to the letter exactly in him surely that great person called the son of god ought to know how to set up the new testament church yes don't you believe that he ought to have a conception to know how to set up the new testament church the first thing i want to call your attention over here in matthew 16th chapter that when he is speaking there when he come down was talking to the disciples he said who does man say i the son of man am and they said some say you're elias and some say you're so and so and some say you're so and so and like that different one he said but who do you say that i am and peter said thou art the christ the son of the living god he said blessed art thou simon son of jonas for flesh and blood is not revealed it's you but my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you and and i'll say underneath the art simon or art peter and upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell can't prevail against him now there we're speaking of the church now watch closely and if i'm wrong god forgive me and you forgive me now the catholic church says that that was a stone laying there peter and upon peter he built the church now we know that that's wrong we protestants disagree with it but we protestant says it was himself that he built himself a church up on himself but if you'll notice i want to disagree with that friendly it wasn't that it was up on the spiritual revelation of himself flesh and blood you never learn this in a seminary as good as they are you never learn this by some church creed as good as it is it's all right but flesh and blood has not revealed this to you it's not an intellectual conception of how you make your speech how you must die yourself how what great thing you must do here on earth that isn't what it is it isn't build a great thing or do a great thing what it is is a revelation of the word of god he was the word in the beginning was the word and the word is with god and the word was god and the word was made manifest and dwelt among us he was that was a revelation of the word of god the spirit in peter revealing by spiritual revelation that he was the son of god made manifest the god of glory manifesting the glory of god upon this rock spiritual revelation of the word i'll build my church why if them prophets was under god speaking by the holy spirit that that was the son of god the same spirit on this side reveals right back the same thing you see it flesh and blood you can't learn it in a seminary you learn your get your dd and your phd and held here that was all right wish you had it that's right but still that's not it you don't have to have it yet it's good to have it you can be this plus but if you have to rub out the plus take this this is that if this ain't that let me have this anyhow i want this this flesh and blood has not revealed this to you you never learn it through the educational line you never learn through denominational lines they're fine education denomination is fine that's part of it but people are laying too much to that and they're leaving the spiritual discernment amen see flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you and upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell can prevail against it will never be able to prevail show they would be against it now watch and see where the gates of hell is against it ain't against the denomination the government recognizes that it is the world recognizes our denominations all of them we have the rights each one of us is american citizens we have the rights of denomination which is fine we appreciate that but that's not what the gates of hell is against it's against the spiritual revelation of christ being held out of the same destiny today and forever that's what it's against the gates of hell shall be against it but it shall never prevail there you are spiritual discernment regardless of who it is is my brother as long as he's trying to achieve the same purpose that i'm working for let him be prophet let him be pastor let it be deacon let him be so and so let god honor him this way that way whatever it is disarm me whatever he wants to do but yet that's my brother hallelujah we're working for the same thing we're sending our our all of our works into the same kingdom honor he's working for the same thing i am spiritual discernment spiritual revelation of god look here if you want jesus i preached the other night somewhere maybe down there it wasn't so from the beginning we have to go back to the beginning to find our text now for just a moment at the beginning there was cain intellectual build a fine church we would say made a fine altar offered up a sacrifice prayed sincere gave thanks paid his tithes everything just as religious as abel was but abel there was no bible in them days but by spiritual revelation he seen that it wasn't fruits of the field that caused us to sin it wasn't apples that they eat see it wasn't apples revelation told him that and it wasn't the fruits that caused him to come out of there it was life the separation of life so he went and got a lamb and offered it in his skin by faith which is spiritual revelation amen the revelation of god spiritual revelation it was revealed to him it isn't a fruit it isn't apples it isn't peaches plums and pears it was a separation of life so he went and got alive and offered it instead of fruits fruit says watch you your works are your own hands what you do there i'll go and build this i'll go do this i'll support that that's good he had an alternative the same as the other did both of them had alders that was good but it was a real spiritual revealed truth of the thing where the spirit of god revealed it upon that rock the rock that christ died on the rock of ages upon the rock that abel's lamb died on that little abel as he put his hands upon that little lamb and his little white wolf being bathed as he took a a rock they didn't have a lance in that day and chop this little neck like that and hammered it and the poor little thing dying the blood bathing his hands and his little wool old babe was bloody blading and crying what did he speak of the lamb of god some four thousand years later spiritually revealed the church turning him down and the people called him beelzebub and a devil because all the prophets that spoke out they denied the prophets always said you build their suffolkers and you put them in there you wanted walls he said to them without spiritual discernment not knowing that that was the lamb of god that he was supposed to be that way and act that way because he was fulfilling the word of god and the holy ghost church today acting the way they do doing the things to do they're fulfilling the word of god hallelujah you see peter said on the day of pentecost this is that and he said it's unto you and to your children and them that's far off even as many as the lord our god shall call them same inspired prophet said the evening light would shine there would be a former ladder rain together as in the days of grace looking here what is it the farmer rains coming over and the latter rain is past you then it's left over it's to gather the former ladder reign together the holy spirit may manifest by the power and the resurrection of jesus christ there you are coming together the farmer god's grace he said as it was the days of noah his grace was long suffering here it is today long suffering a lap over brings the cloud from the old days the cloud from this day together the former rain run in first the first rain we've had now here comes the latter rain coming over the former rain coming over the latter rain east and west meeting together both rains falling together divine healing plus the angel of god revealing the secrets of the hearts and bringing everything to pass oh look that true born children of god would see that there you are the spirit revealing revelation that's what jesus said the church would be built upon well then somebody might raise up and say well sure we so and so we're built upon that let's take his word a little farther the last commission to his church he said go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature all the world how long is the last all the world to how many ever creature he that believeth and is baptized not the church he's a personal pronoun he that believeth the individual is david do places said about the grandchildren there's no grandchildren in the kingdom of god it's children your father was pentecostal and you're just coming here to this church because he come here to the 11th and garfield and receive the holy ghost this brought you in as a grandchild you're wrong amen god's got to reveal himself to you and no man can call jesus of christ by intellectual conceptions no man can call jesus of christ because he feels sorry for his sins and comes to repent no man can call jesus the christ only by the re that revelation of the holy ghost making it known to him upon this rock i'll kill my church and the gates of hell never revealed against him there's the revelation there it is what he's built his church upon who did it peter no no no who did it christ said the revelation of god the holy spirit would bring it to you a little while and i'll leave you but i'll pray the father and he'll send you the comforter we'll bring these things to your remembrance is that right what he's doing this morning and will what show you things to come the holy spirit in the church in the last days now you say brother hallelujah that's my church wait a minute jesus said this will all man know you're my disciples in saint john 13 35 this will all man know you're my disciples when you have love one for the other the spirit revealed truth of the kingdom of god to come looking out to the end hunter seeing what the prophets cried about see what jesus spoke about and you're the same holy spirit and you're crying right back that's right that's right what is it is spiritual revealed truth i love my brethren regardless of where they go to church or their former ladder or no rain at all as long as they're in the body of christ trying to achieve not something for a certain purpose to manifest yourself on earth but the purpose for the kingdom of god and the glory of his coming to reveal and make knowing his soon appearing now in closing we want to think of this upon this rock i'll be on my church correctly and then we find out over in john 14 7 he said this the works that i do shall you do also the works that i do what kind of works did he do to make yourself known you remember about peter don't you what we've been talking about philip the woman at the well predicted it not to go to the gentiles but would be in the last days as it said as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man there's a revelation written in mysteries like this to the outside world to the world it knows about but you precious brethren you precious sisters you are not children of the darkness you're not children of the night but your children are the light walking in the light as he is in the light then we have fellowship one with another while the blood of jesus christ god's son cleanses all our sins from all of us there you are the servants of the lord jesus says i quote my scripture on here got mark 16 yes mark 16 he said go ye into all the world here's what kind of a church he set up the last commission to the church going into all the world preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned now look here look at the spiritual desert he that believeth and is baptized you never exactly say which way but we want to fuss about that see the other thing see he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved whatever he wants to be baptized that's up to him if his achievements for the kingdom of god come on brother we're marching on with the same spirit if i'm wrong then you'll tell it'll come out that way if you're wrong it'll be that but our hearts and our motives and our objectives is for the kingdom of god on earth you know we are we're important to calvary me and my ideas why i got i ain't got a brother likes cherry pie as well as i do but we're brothers see none of them likes to hunt and fish like i do but we're brothers see what i mean i got my own ideas but that don't make him not my brother his father is my father his family is my family there you are the patriarchs all different one from another but there was a one father and they should work to one thing and they rejected the main one in there because he was spiritual don't you see it brethren can't you see what i'm speaking of now notice and we're in closing go into all the world preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues what is spiritual revelation they shall speak with new tongues if they take up serpents or drink deadly things it shall not harm them if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover that was what the new church was that's the kind of church of jesus christ this great one that all the prophets cried out would do we find his spirit comes over here and predicts that his spirit and the people come right back and do the things that he did may i close and saying this i got about a dozen more scriptures here but we haven't got the time i think but listen to this may i close and saying this ever true born-again prophet of the lord preacher sunday school teacher seer apostle missionary whatever he might be his whole heart is set and he's so filled and anointed with the spirit of god so anointed whatever his office is whatever it might be to preach or to teach or to evangelize or to see visions whatever it is he'll do it for the kingdom of god and the spirit of god will speak right back to the man and manifest it's the kingdom of god then we me as a baptist i see you pentecostals you're my brother you don't belong to baptist church i did that's the only church i ever did belonged to was a baptist church but that don't stand in my way i see what the spirit of god is with you i see what you're trying to do well if me a baptist can feel that way surely the assemblies the church of god the united pentecostals the independents and all of us brethren together ought to see that we're trying to work for one purpose let's have spiritual discernment now listen in closing i'll make this slash remark many are sick and weakly among you and many are asleep spiritually dead because they don't have discernment of the body of christ this sick body that we got god help us to have spiritual discernment of that revelation of the kingdom of god and of the love of god in our hearts shed abroad by the holy ghost to try to put our arms way out say we are brethren see what i mean and every little gift that you have don't use it to try to make it some great something for ourselves let's make it for the kingdom of god to work with everyone to try to uplift the cause of jesus christ for his coming is soon do you believe it i'm so sorry to keep you so long brother david will be here tomorrow to teach you the scriptures but right now let's bow our heads just a moment [Applause] [Music] shall be [Music] christian soldiers marching as to war with the cross of jesus going on before [Music] oh [Music] you believe you are raise your [Music] our objectives [Music] soldiers [Music] of jesus [Music] forward into battle [Music] marching has to [Music] if

or you're going through a time or and we all do have times we get irritated we kind of wonder just say lord search my heart help me to check my motive help me to check my spirit you know and and just help us to get through those times and when when jesus tells them by this shall all know all men know you are my disciples when you have love for one another and i think sometimes we think and i'm going to say it this way the magic of love just suddenly there's never a bad thought there's never a hard time no there are those things still but the love of god in your life is greater than that and you would say lord just help that be my motive if i could see my brother and sister to help them along the way if i could pick my you know that pick that wounded one up and help them along the way lord father this this evening we've heard lord discernment of spirit father let us each take take that personally and just look at ourselves and say lord help me be like david when that man came up and spit on him and threw dirt on him he said just leave it the lord is trying me lord let me come forth as gold lord and let you have all preeminence that you have all glory let jesus christ be lifted up in all things lord we pray that for one another may we love one another may we encourage one another and pray for everyone daily lord is our prayer in jesus christ's name just one more scripture i just failed to read it psalms 121 before you go brother jordan if you put that up psalms 121 it's always been a favorite scripture of mine and just encourage us with that it says i will lift up mine eyes into the hills from whence cometh from whence cometh my help my help cometh from the lord which made heaven and earth he will not he will not suffer thy foot to be moved he that keepeth thee will not slumber behold he that keepeth israel shall not neither slumber nor sleep the lord is thy keeper the lord is thy shade upon thy right hand the sun shall not smite thee by day nor the moon by night the lord shall preserve thee from all evil he shall preserve thy soul the lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth and even forevermore that's prom sometimes i just read that and i remind myself that's that's the one that keeps me that's the one that watches over me and that's when it keeps his words so amen we thank them thank him for his
