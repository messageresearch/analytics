[30:39] John McFadden
[30:41] brother John brother John's a pastor in
[30:45] Philadelphia brother John come up you
[30:47] got to say a few words you got to be
[30:48] instant in season and out of season come
[30:51] on up brother oh it's so good to see you
[30:53] it's been a long time
[30:58] yeah
[31:01] I'm sorry to embarrass you
[31:03] so good
[31:10] well good morning it's good to be here
[31:13] um you know we took a group out to a
[31:16] voice of God where I met Dan first time
[31:20] to be honest I was telling the people
[31:21] don't be critical
[31:24] you know if you see something strange
[31:27] just being honest and uh
[31:29] when we met brother Dan I thought wow
[31:31] he's kind of normal
[31:34] so uh
[31:37] probably true but anyway we appreciated
[31:40] the tour we had and it was a blessing
[31:43] and uh
[31:44] so that's that's the probably the first
[31:46] and last time I met you maybe yeah
[31:49] yeah so uh
[31:50] you know I was thinking sitting there
[31:53] recently um some Jehovah Witnesses came
[31:56] up to our house and um
[31:59] I was going somewhere I was kind of late
[32:02] I'm like I've been through this before
[32:03] you know
[32:06] so they're very nice ladies and tapping
[32:09] on my car window and uh
[32:12] and they wanted to I said that your team
[32:15] will schedule some other time I said
[32:16] well
[32:17] I kind of know what you believe
[32:20] and uh
[32:22] I believe Jehovah the Old Testament is
[32:24] the Jesus of the new yes amen
[32:26] amen and frankly I think you missed the
[32:28] whole point
[32:30] you know and um you know I gave him some
[32:33] scriptures you know Isaiah you know unto
[32:35] us a child was born
[32:36] unto us a son was given
[32:39] you know his name shall be called
[32:42] the counselor principally the the
[32:45] Everlasting your father the Mighty God I
[32:48] said I believe Jesus Is God not the a
[32:52] son the second person but the person of
[32:55] God
[32:56] and when any movement misses the main
[32:59] focus there's something wrong amen
[33:03] even this end time movement yes
[33:06] yes you know I love brother Branham and
[33:09] I believe he fulfilled the scriptures
[33:10] but Jesus Christ is the one that came
[33:13] and touch me
[33:17] save me and uh so uh
[33:20] I just love to hear people want to
[33:23] worship Jesus Christ because we know
[33:25] brother Graham when we get to the other
[33:27] side he's going to stand there with us
[33:29] while we worship Jesus Christ so we've
[33:32] got to keep our focus on the main thing
[33:34] and it's all about him it's all about
[33:36] Jesus so that's all
[33:39] [Applause]
[33:46] well John we miss your boy
[33:51] been trying to get him back
[33:55] I am thank the Lord for what brother
[33:58] John just said it is it's all about our
[33:59] lord Jesus you know this whole Bible
[34:02] was written to point us towards the Lord
[34:04] Jesus
[34:05] every Prophet that has ever come new
[34:08] testament old testament appointed people
[34:11] to Old Testament Jehovah the New
[34:15] Testament Jesus then they're the same
[34:17] one and I thank God that
[34:20] he did send us a messenger in our age
[34:22] that pointed us to the same Jesus Christ
[34:27] the same God Of Heaven that the other
[34:31] disciples and the other Apostles pointed
[34:33] us to and brother John if we miss what
[34:36] he pointed us to then we missed the
[34:38] whole message
[34:39] and it's it's not about a man it's not
[34:42] about
[34:44] um
[34:45] an end time or an age it's about Christ
[34:48] it's about our lord Jesus I'm so
[34:50] thankful for him as I've said many times
[34:53] I wish I had more words
[34:56] to thank him more words to describe him
[34:59] he he is nothing short of the Mighty God
[35:03] the Everlasting father exactly what you
[35:07] said

[39:53] lately the the offerings that we take

[40:03] projects that we do like like with camp
[40:05] and and like with the new rooms that
[40:08] we've made and any Renovations that we
[40:10] have planned for the the fellowship hall

[48:50] God bless you and I also want to say
[48:53] thank you so much for the prayers past
[48:56] and the church
[48:57] I had gone to
[49:00] Jeffersonville via Chicago
[49:03] I was really wanting to get to
[49:05] Jeffersonville
[49:07] and by his grace
[49:09] and the arrangements of the pasta
[49:12] I went to Jeffersonville
[49:14] so now you can tell the brother from
[49:18] Africa after hearing this message for
[49:22] the past 34 years
[49:24] and I'm hearing the prophet on the tape
[49:26] The Taste months the profit on the tape
[49:29] and now I come to Tucson Tabernacle and
[49:34] this morning
[49:36] when I woke up
[49:38] I was listening to the message that he
[49:40] preached here from this physical pulpit
[49:43] he preached the message expectation
[49:46] Sunday morning
[49:48] and then in the evening the message was
[49:52] Jesus Christ the same yesterday to the
[49:54] end forever
[49:55] and in that message in the morning he
[49:58] was
[49:59] thanking the pastor and then the brother
[50:03] uh
[50:05] brother Norman
[50:06] and his wife they had just taken
[50:08] residence into Tucson and they started
[50:11] attending this church before it became
[50:13] Tucson Tabernacle and then this brother
[50:16] Norman was a carpenter-like so brother
[50:20] Norman was contracted to do these steps
[50:25] and then brother Norman
[50:27] according to the prophet in the tape he
[50:29] says when brother Norman was doing the
[50:31] second or the last step
[50:33] he started crying
[50:35] and he says Lord if you can make brother
[50:38] Branham to step on these steps
[50:41] one day so walesty was there I don't
[50:43] know where he was but the prophet says
[50:45] in the tape he was somewhere there and
[50:48] then the prophet says now I am here I
[50:51] think he made the prophet somewhere and
[50:53] he was crying brother Norman because the
[50:56] desire of the heart was fulfilled I want
[51:00] you to listen to that message again now
[51:02] you can imagine things that we were told
[51:05] now I'm imagining
[51:08] this is the physical pulpit
[51:11] that is stood in
[51:13] preached the message
[51:15] expectation
[51:16] and if you go to the prayer meeting the
[51:19] prayer prayer line in the evening of
[51:21] that message is tremendous
[51:24] so I traveled to Jeffersonville
[51:27] the associate pastor opened for me and I
[51:30] entered into the sanctuary and had
[51:34] prayers there when is the service again
[51:37] and the brother to the pastor brother
[51:41] Adam was here the other day I was at
[51:44] their home
[51:45] for two nights then I was picked by
[51:48] another brother from Africa who has been
[51:50] there for quite some time
[51:52] and at this house there is a friend to
[51:55] this brother he's a brother that I know
[51:58] from Zambia but he comes from Congo so
[52:01] he says brother Jonathan is here he says
[52:03] I'm coming to see him
[52:04] so when he comes to Simi he brings me
[52:07] this jacket
[52:08] and the shirt it is at home he says here
[52:11] is your jacket brother Jonathan I want
[52:13] to tell you the testimony
[52:15] he says uh
[52:17] is ministering in the best place of
[52:20] brother Brennan
[52:22] and he went there
[52:24] and he meets this boy is talking to this
[52:28] boy he invites this boy to the church uh
[52:31] this boy invites this brother to their
[52:34] church and the brother enters he sings a
[52:37] song he starts talking to them and their
[52:40] seats amen there who happens to be the
[52:42] father of this brother this young boy
[52:45] was a church
[52:46] and when they are talking
[52:49] they are talking they are talking they
[52:52] are talking this man believes the
[52:55] message some people in that church they
[52:57] believe the message the church starts
[53:00] and
[53:01] this young man says uh this is my father
[53:04] he's about 90 something years
[53:07] so this man calls this brother from
[53:10] Zambia from Congo he says come here I
[53:12] want to tell you something
[53:13] [Music]
[53:15] and he says uh
[53:18] you know what
[53:24] I am the man
[53:27] that lowered the casket
[53:30] of brother Brennan
[53:37] I saw God
[53:40] from that day on
[53:43] that that man
[53:45] was a man of God
[53:48] and as we are talking today
[53:51] that man
[53:52] has believed this message
[53:55] after the passing now of the prophet
[53:59] I want to say to you that brother sister
[54:01] this message
[54:04] is truth
[54:07] this message
[54:09] is crust
[54:13] we come from Branham Tabernacle
[54:16] and they took me to the Grave side I
[54:18] just wanted to offer a prayer there and
[54:19] thank the Lord for the ministry
[54:22] and from the graveside the brother says
[54:24] let's go for lunch
[54:27] so we walk into this eating place and
[54:30] there are three ladies there
[54:33] 80 something three ladies one is in the
[54:36] wheelchair and they are seated there I
[54:39] think they were waiting to be saved and
[54:41] so we stand by the counter the brother
[54:43] is trying to pay and I'm standing like
[54:45] this behind the brother
[54:48] and I feel a part here
[54:50] and is one of the ladies the old ladies
[54:53] there she walked straight to where I was
[54:55] standing and she passed me here and then
[54:58] I came this way I said hello mom she
[55:01] says hello can I talk to you I said yes
[55:05] please
[55:06] then she says are you a minister of the
[55:09] Gospel
[55:12] I kept quiet
[55:14] I pretended as if I didn't hear I said I
[55:17] beg your pardon says are you the
[55:19] minister of the Gospel
[55:21] I said yes ma'am okay come here so she
[55:25] takes me to where the three were seated
[55:27] then she says which mess well which
[55:30] church is this
[55:31] then I said um my name is Jonathan I'm
[55:34] from Africa
[55:35] I am I believe of the end time message
[55:38] brought by William Brenner and the lady
[55:40] in the wheelchair she says wow
[55:44] I am my believer of that message
[55:47] I used to go to the Tabernacle now I'm
[55:49] on
[55:51] right in Jefferson Town the power behind
[55:55] this message
[55:59] the devil may try to do
[56:01] anything that you try to discourage you
[56:05] and it will make you probably come to a
[56:09] level where you start doubting
[56:11] whether this message is true or not
[56:14] I'm a witness today
[56:16] this message
[56:18] is truth
[56:22] and is Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[56:24] to the end forever I think on Sunday
[56:26] I'll show that speak to those pictures
[56:28] pastor and then when we give the
[56:31] Testament let's land on our feet As we
[56:33] sing that song Let's bow our heads and
[56:37] close our eyes for a moment and just
[56:39] sing that chorus as the pastor comes

[57:37] Lord I believe
[57:44] Lord I believe
[57:48] [Music]
[57:52] are possible
[57:55] Lord
[57:57] I believe

[58:11] I believe
[58:15] all things are possible
[58:22] Lord I believe
[58:27] brother mentioned
[58:31] expectation the sermon brother Brandon
[58:34] preached from this Pulpit right here
[58:38] and he said he told some people
[58:41] afterwards brother Aaron has given the
[58:43] testimony to talk to another brother
[58:44] yesterday that gave me the same
[58:46] testimony
[58:47] he said when brother Branham left this
[58:49] church
[58:51] he said that his message
[58:54] was for a group of Mexican people
[58:58] that were over in in the side area here
[59:01] of the church sitting in the front
[59:06] and
[59:07] those people
[59:09] many of their families are with us today
[59:13] and today after service
[59:16] I'm going to be baptizing
[59:18] two more
[59:26] at least two more
[59:28] from that same family
[59:31] that was over there
[59:33] profit
[59:38] it's just some of the things that he
[59:40] said or just they're overwhelming
[59:44] a couple months ago I was at a
[59:46] Minister's meeting
[59:49] and
[59:51] we had a special speaker up in up in
[59:53] Phoenix brother McGarry's Church
[59:57] and this brother
[1:00:00] had an anointing on him
[1:00:04] and as I was listening to him speak
[1:00:07] his revelation of the word just
[1:00:10] impressed me so much
[1:00:12] brother John that he had that
[1:00:14] understanding that it is Jesus Christ
[1:00:17] and all the prophets pointed to this man
[1:00:20] Jesus Christ
[1:00:23] and as I listened to him
[1:00:26] I started praying and I prayed for for
[1:00:29] months a few at least a few weeks and
[1:00:32] asking the Lord as you know there's very
[1:00:34] few brothers that come to this Pulpit
[1:00:37] very few
[1:00:40] and
[1:00:42] I asked the Lord Lord would you want
[1:00:44] that brother
[1:00:46] to speak here to speak to your sheep
[1:00:50] and believe that it is the Lord's will
[1:00:52] that that brother speaks to us this
[1:00:54] morning
[1:00:55] brother Ryan
[1:00:57] let's if we could sing only believe one
[1:01:00] more time as this brother as brother
[1:01:02] Ryan takes the pulpit brother Ryan long
[1:01:04] God bless you
[1:01:06] [Music]

[1:01:34] [Applause]
[1:01:35] [Music]
[1:01:37] baby
[1:01:42] [Music]
[1:01:45] all things are possible
[1:01:51] only
[1:01:53] be delicious bow our heads as they just
[1:01:56] play that slowly
[1:01:58] approach
[1:02:00] the one that we believe in
[1:02:02] Heavenly Father
[1:02:08] Lord You're So merciful to us Lord
[1:02:11] you're so gracious to us Lord You're
[1:02:15] so forgiving Lord and father that you
[1:02:18] would just allow us
[1:02:20] to come together Lord as a group of
[1:02:22] Believers Lord
[1:02:24] is no small thing in this day and age
[1:02:28] it's not something I want to take for
[1:02:30] granted Lord that you would just provide
[1:02:33] a place Lord provide a a safe shelter
[1:02:36] Lord for believers to gather and Lord
[1:02:37] that you would place in the heart of
[1:02:39] each person in here Lord the inspiration
[1:02:42] to walk through the door this morning
[1:02:46] and Lord we do it in anticipation to
[1:02:48] hear from you
[1:02:50] Lord to receive a Divine word Lord
[1:02:55] a divine revelation straight from the
[1:02:57] Throne of God
[1:02:58] Lord that's what I'm after this morning
[1:03:00] Lord and I believe Lord you see the
[1:03:03] Heart Lord of each person in here father
[1:03:05] that
[1:03:06] Lord maybe we are distracted Lord by
[1:03:08] things that have happened yesterday Lord
[1:03:11] or this morning Father
[1:03:13] but I think you see the intent of the
[1:03:14] heart of everyone in here Lord is to
[1:03:16] hear from you this morning Lord
[1:03:19] would you just help us Lord as as just
[1:03:21] humans Lord just to set aside those
[1:03:23] distractions Lord those thoughts of
[1:03:26] earlier today and maybe later today just
[1:03:29] set those aside father and just focus in
[1:03:31] on you this morning
[1:03:32] I believe that we've worshiped you Lord
[1:03:34] I believe that we've tried our best Lord
[1:03:36] to make you welcome father
[1:03:38] and Lord I believe there's there's two
[1:03:41] or three in here Lord that I've gathered
[1:03:42] that believe in your name father and
[1:03:43] Lord You've promised to be here with us
[1:03:45] this morning Lord not for our past
[1:03:48] people or a future people Lord but for
[1:03:50] this group of people this morning here
[1:03:52] Lord You've promised to be here
[1:03:54] and Lord would you just come and speak
[1:03:56] to us now this morning Lord in Jesus
[1:03:58] name we ask amen
[1:04:01] God bless you this morning it's
[1:04:04] always always good to be in the house of
[1:04:08] the Lord
[1:04:09] at least that's how I feel it's not
[1:04:11] always uh comfortable to be in this
[1:04:14] position in the house of the Lord I much
[1:04:16] prefer to be where you're sitting at
[1:04:18] this morning but it's still good
[1:04:20] nonetheless to be in the house of the
[1:04:21] Lord how many how many is happy to be
[1:04:23] here
[1:04:24] amen amen it's good to hear this morning
[1:04:28] and I appreciate the the words that the
[1:04:32] Pastor said this morning I certainly
[1:04:34] give all the honor and glory to God as
[1:04:36] we as we want to do in everything if you
[1:04:39] know if we do any good thing it's not
[1:04:42] because we are good but it's because
[1:04:43] he's good amen and and and it's just the
[1:04:47] more that God does for us and the more
[1:04:49] that we see him in our lives the more
[1:04:51] humble we should be
[1:04:53] and that is the call I believe of this
[1:04:56] of this age and this morning is to be
[1:05:00] humble
[1:05:01] to be not puffed up and not be thinking
[1:05:05] great of ourselves but to realize that
[1:05:08] without the grace of God where would I
[1:05:11] be
[1:05:12] where would I be this morning without
[1:05:13] the grace of God Amen we appreciate the
[1:05:16] invitation from
[1:05:18] our brother this morning and and the
[1:05:20] confidence and we appreciate you coming
[1:05:22] out this morning to church it's um
[1:05:24] we just want to lean on God this morning

[1:05:28] God this morning

[1:05:33] wife there in the middle and I was
[1:05:35] looking around to see if I knew anybody
[1:05:38] and
[1:05:39] I think there's faces that look familiar

[1:05:55] throughout her life so
[1:05:57] but it's just good to be here this
[1:05:58] morning amen let's read a scripture and
[1:06:00] then I'll let you be seated and
[1:06:03] you know I have notes and I have
[1:06:04] scriptures and stuff but we want to do
[1:06:06] we want to place all this before the
[1:06:08] Lord
[1:06:09] you know maybe you have thoughts of what
[1:06:11] you might need this morning but we want
[1:06:12] to place that before the Lord and let
[1:06:14] him give us what he knows we have need
[1:06:17] of amen and we want to have him speak
[1:06:19] the words that he would like to speak
[1:06:21] let's let's turn to Second Corinthians
[1:06:23] uh chapter two I had a thought on my
[1:06:25] heart for for about a week or so when
[1:06:28] brother Dan had asked me to come and
[1:06:30] brother Dan just a day or so ago the
[1:06:32] Lord just put a different thought on my
[1:06:34] heart so I'm just gonna go with that
[1:06:36] this morning and trust that it's the
[1:06:37] leading of the Lord if that's okay
[1:06:38] Second Corinthians chapter 2
[1:06:42] and we'll just read two verses and we'll
[1:06:43] let you have your seats verse 14 and
[1:06:46] verse 15.
[1:06:48] for second Corinthians chapter 2 it says
[1:06:51] now thanks be unto God
[1:06:54] which always causeth us to Triumph in
[1:06:58] Christ
[1:07:01] and maketh manifest the savior of his
[1:07:05] knowledge By Us in every place
[1:07:10] for we
[1:07:12] how many is that talking to you about
[1:07:14] this morning
[1:07:16] for we
[1:07:18] are unto God a sweet saver of Christ
[1:07:25] in them that are saved and in them that
[1:07:29] perish you may be seated
[1:07:31] man I don't know what you think about
[1:07:32] yourself this morning maybe you have
[1:07:35] been a Christian a long time maybe you
[1:07:37] have not been a Christian for maybe a
[1:07:40] year maybe you don't even consider
[1:07:42] yourself to be a Christian maybe you're
[1:07:43] just trying to find the Lord
[1:07:46] but I want you to know what God thinks
[1:07:48] about you
[1:07:51] what God thinks about you is that you to
[1:07:54] him are a sweet saver
[1:08:01] you say well when I become a good
[1:08:03] Christian brother
[1:08:05] that's not what that scripture says
[1:08:09] when I deserve to be thought about that
[1:08:11] way by God that's not what it says
[1:08:13] you are a sweet saver to God
[1:08:19] undeserved
[1:08:22] undeservedly so
[1:08:25] that's the grace that's the God that I
[1:08:27] serve
[1:08:28] that's the grace that he's bestowed upon
[1:08:30] us
[1:08:31] is that despite myself he looks at me
[1:08:35] as I'm a reward I'm I'm something that
[1:08:38] he purchased and he bought and paid for
[1:08:40] you know brother bran would say if I had
[1:08:42] a cup with the blood of Jesus here with
[1:08:44] a drop of the blood it would be
[1:08:46] something we would just we would just
[1:08:49] take and and make it sacred and just and
[1:08:52] just think so highly of it but he said
[1:08:54] about have something greater here this
[1:08:56] morning which is the purchase of that
[1:08:58] blood
[1:08:59] and I don't know if you've ever thought
[1:09:01] about that but but God
[1:09:03] values you
[1:09:05] above the blood of his own son
[1:09:08] that he would take that blood and he
[1:09:11] would buy you with that blood
[1:09:14] if that could ever drop down into really
[1:09:17] truly drop down into our hearts it
[1:09:20] wouldn't just change us from a sinner
[1:09:22] into a saint it would change everything
[1:09:24] about us it would change the way that we
[1:09:27] we look at one another it would change
[1:09:29] the way that we talk to one another it
[1:09:31] would change the way that we look at a
[1:09:32] sinner
[1:09:34] it would it would change the way we look
[1:09:36] at one but talk to One treat one amen if
[1:09:39] that really would drop down and I and I
[1:09:41] don't know anyone here so I I Lord knows
[1:09:44] that I can't really not going to preach
[1:09:45] at anybody brother Dan you know I just
[1:09:47] just so if you take it personal it
[1:09:49] wasn't personal you know I I always feel
[1:09:52] safe just talking to myself
[1:09:55] just preaching to myself I feel safe
[1:09:57] there because I know that this word no
[1:09:59] matter if it cuts
[1:10:01] it applies
[1:10:03] I can apply it to myself you know I
[1:10:05] talked about you know asking for
[1:10:07] distractions I I had distractions this
[1:10:09] morning that I had to pray that Lord
[1:10:11] would you just remove those out of the
[1:10:12] way
[1:10:14] you know the minister or the pastor or
[1:10:16] they're not exempt from this I don't
[1:10:17] believe the prophet was exempt from that
[1:10:20] we want to set ourselves aside for
[1:10:22] service amen and I just read that
[1:10:24] scripture if we could read another one I
[1:10:26] hope it's okay I just have a few
[1:10:27] scriptures this morning like I said I
[1:10:29] have some notes here but we want to just
[1:10:31] put these all in the Lord's hands amen
[1:10:33] would that be okay
[1:10:36] let's turn over to uh the book of uh
[1:10:39] The Book of Luke in chapter 7 of that
[1:10:43] book and
[1:10:45] this is just a subject that you know I
[1:10:47] listened to listen to a lot of messages
[1:10:49] throughout my life but there's some
[1:10:50] messages that oh it's hard to say you
[1:10:52] have a favorite but I'm sure maybe some
[1:10:54] of us have a favorite and and there's a
[1:10:56] story that brother Brown tells
[1:10:58] he reads from the Bible and he
[1:11:00] dramatizes this story and I don't know
[1:11:02] why brother Dan but it's just always
[1:11:03] been something that's just impacted me
[1:11:06] uh just so heavily and maybe it's
[1:11:08] because I find myself in that story and
[1:11:11] when you find yourself in a story in a
[1:11:13] Bible because I don't believe the Bible
[1:11:14] is just a collection of fables I believe
[1:11:17] that there are events that happen
[1:11:19] and when you find yourself an event that
[1:11:21] happens in the Bible then you can see
[1:11:23] how you turn out
[1:11:25] you can see what the Lord is capable of
[1:11:27] doing in your life today in 2023
[1:11:31] when I find myself in this story in the
[1:11:33] Bible and I see how it turned out I can
[1:11:35] say Lord You've laid down a formula for
[1:11:38] me to follow and if I follow that
[1:11:40] formula I know what'll happen in the end
[1:11:43] and so Luke chapter seven and and this
[1:11:46] should be familiar to us but I just want
[1:11:48] to read through this and it's a few
[1:11:50] verses here but if you don't mind we'll
[1:11:51] just read a little scripture Luke 7 36
[1:11:53] it says in one of the Pharisees decide
[1:11:55] desired that he would eat with him and
[1:11:58] he went into the Pharisees house and sat
[1:12:00] down to meet and behold a woman in the
[1:12:03] city which was a sinner when she knew
[1:12:06] that Jesus sat at me in the Pharisees
[1:12:08] house brought an alabaster box of
[1:12:10] ointment and stood At His Feet behind
[1:12:13] him weeping
[1:12:15] and began to wash his feet with tears
[1:12:19] and did wipe them with the hairs of her
[1:12:21] head
[1:12:22] and kissed his feet and anointed them
[1:12:25] with the ointment
[1:12:27] and when the Pharisee which had been in
[1:12:29] him saw it he spake within himself
[1:12:30] saying this man if he were a prophet
[1:12:34] would have known who and what manner of
[1:12:37] woman this is that toucheth him for she
[1:12:39] is a sinner
[1:12:42] you can see how the Pharisee was viewing
[1:12:44] this sinner
[1:12:47] and Jesus answered and said on him Simon
[1:12:49] I have somewhat to say unto thee and he
[1:12:51] said Master say on
[1:12:53] there was a certain creditor which had
[1:12:55] two debtors and one owed 500 Pence and
[1:12:58] the other 50. and when they had nothing
[1:13:00] to pay he frankly forgave them both tell
[1:13:03] me therefore which of them will love him
[1:13:04] the most
[1:13:06] and Simon answered and said I suppose
[1:13:08] that he to whom he forgave most and he
[1:13:10] said unto him thou Hast rightly judged
[1:13:13] and he turned to the woman and said unto
[1:13:15] Simon see us thou this woman
[1:13:18] I entered into thine house and thou
[1:13:21] gavest me no water for my feet but she
[1:13:23] has washed my feet with tears and wiped
[1:13:25] them with the hairs of her head and thou
[1:13:27] gavest me no kiss but this woman since
[1:13:29] the time I came in hath not ceased to
[1:13:32] kiss my feet my head with oil thou didst
[1:13:34] not anoint but this woman hath anointed
[1:13:37] my feet with ointment
[1:13:39] wherefore I say unto thee her sins
[1:13:42] which were our many
[1:13:45] are forgiven
[1:13:50] for she loved much
[1:13:55] but to whom little Is Forgiven the same
[1:13:57] loveth little
[1:14:02] that's a little study and if we have a
[1:14:05] love problem maybe we should go to this
[1:14:07] scripture
[1:14:09] and he said unto her
[1:14:12] thy sins are forgiven
[1:14:17] it's one thing to read in the Bible when
[1:14:19] Jesus says that he has forgiven the sins
[1:14:22] of a sinner as he's talking to Simon he
[1:14:24] tells him her sins are many and they're
[1:14:26] forgiven and it's another thing
[1:14:29] when he turns directly to you
[1:14:32] and he tells you that
[1:14:35] you know I hear a lot I I we read the
[1:14:37] message we read the Bible and it's so
[1:14:40] good to hear the message and good so
[1:14:41] good to hear the Bible but when it
[1:14:44] becomes personal to you
[1:14:47] it's a different message and it's a
[1:14:49] different Bible
[1:14:51] when it's not just said to a church to a
[1:14:54] group of people I believe in church I
[1:14:56] believe in gathering as a group of
[1:14:57] people but this message in this Bible
[1:14:59] was sent to individual hearts
[1:15:03] and when this Bible and this message
[1:15:04] become individually received by you I'm
[1:15:07] telling you it's a different Bible
[1:15:11] and they sat at me and they that sad at
[1:15:13] me begin to say within themselves who is
[1:15:15] this that forgive us sins also and he
[1:15:17] said to the woman thy faith has saved
[1:15:19] thee go in peace
[1:15:23] and you think
[1:15:25] you know I I find myself in that story
[1:15:28] and you might ask where I find myself
[1:15:29] and well the obvious answer is I find
[1:15:32] myself in the place of that sinner
[1:15:35] I find myself in the place of that woman
[1:15:37] who did not deserve
[1:15:40] the forgiveness
[1:15:42] but she got it anyways
[1:15:46] and you say when did you find yourself
[1:15:47] in that place brother when you gave your
[1:15:49] heart to the Lord no this morning
[1:15:53] this morning
[1:15:56] when I found myself doing saying or
[1:16:00] thinking something that wasn't from God
[1:16:04] you know a lot of times we take these
[1:16:06] you know maybe you've maybe you've had a
[1:16:08] moment where you come to Christ he said
[1:16:10] brother I gave my heart to the Lord
[1:16:11] years ago and sometimes that just saying
[1:16:14] that Lord I gave my heart to him years
[1:16:16] ago
[1:16:17] but what about this morning
[1:16:21] you know maybe he wants to do something
[1:16:23] new for you today
[1:16:28] and I don't know what your situation is
[1:16:30] maybe you haven't given your heart to
[1:16:31] the Lord
[1:16:33] but I know that today is a new day
[1:16:37] today isn't yesterday today isn't the
[1:16:40] day I first gave my heart to Lord
[1:16:41] today's a day that he wants to receive
[1:16:44] that from me again
[1:16:46] he wants to take from me what I've done
[1:16:48] wrong what I've thought wrong what I've
[1:16:50] said wrong again this morning he wants
[1:16:52] to take it and say
[1:16:54] son today your sins are forgiven
[1:16:58] you don't have to rely on your
[1:17:00] experience
[1:17:01] from years ago from months ago or for
[1:17:04] maybe decades ago you don't need to rely
[1:17:05] on that even though I was there with you
[1:17:07] today I can give you a new experience
[1:17:10] with me
[1:17:11] today I can give you a new Deliverance
[1:17:13] with me today I can give you a new heart
[1:17:16] just give me your old one
[1:17:19] and you know you know for for the
[1:17:21] somebody that's maybe a sinner who's
[1:17:23] just coming to church they can hear that
[1:17:25] and said that brother that makes sense
[1:17:26] that makes sense I want to give my heart
[1:17:28] to the Lord but you know it's hard
[1:17:30] sometimes for us that and I say you know
[1:17:32] again I don't know your situation so
[1:17:34] this is this is without bias this
[1:17:35] morning I don't know your situation or
[1:17:37] how long you've served the Lord but it's
[1:17:39] hard for us sometimes that have served
[1:17:41] the Lord for a little while to get to
[1:17:43] the point where we can give him our
[1:17:44] heart again this morning
[1:17:48] you know sometimes we're relying on that
[1:17:50] manna from yesterday not knowing that
[1:17:52] today there's a fresh Manna available
[1:17:54] that I can't just I can't live on my
[1:17:57] experience from yesterday today I need a
[1:18:00] fresh experience for the Holy Ghost
[1:18:01] today
[1:18:03] and it doesn't take away from our
[1:18:05] experience of yesterday
[1:18:07] but God has something new for you this
[1:18:09] morning
[1:18:10] I'll read another scripture if that's
[1:18:12] okay about this you know it's not the
[1:18:14] same story but I just love that I love
[1:18:17] that the Lord
[1:18:18] you know maybe this this act meant so
[1:18:20] much to him that it's in the Bible you
[1:18:22] know in a couple different ways let's
[1:18:23] turn over to John if you don't mind this
[1:18:25] morning and I'm if you haven't figured
[1:18:27] it out already I'm not much of a
[1:18:29] Preacher uh you know there's definitely
[1:18:31] more uh Brothers with just more of that
[1:18:33] gift and that skill but you know what I
[1:18:35] love the Lord
[1:18:36] and I love sharing with you what he's
[1:18:38] done for me
[1:18:39] and if that's all I could do this
[1:18:41] morning then I believe that we've
[1:18:43] accomplished what the Lord wants us to
[1:18:45] do
[1:18:45] amen is this this water mine over here
[1:18:48] I'm Gonna Take It
[1:18:51] you doing okay this morning
[1:18:54] I know sometimes it's
[1:18:55] boy if you're uncomfortable you should
[1:18:57] you should know how I feel right now
[1:19:01] but you know it's something about
[1:19:02] gathering with those that have the same
[1:19:05] Faith as you and the same the same goal
[1:19:07] in mind amen where we're going where
[1:19:09] we're headed to and and that is
[1:19:11] something that's comforted me uh brother
[1:19:14] Dan that no matter where you go that
[1:19:16] spirit is the same
[1:19:18] that Spirit of the Bride is the same
[1:19:20] amen let's turn over to John 12. and
[1:19:23] let's read a story that's similar to
[1:19:25] this
[1:19:26] if we could John 12 verse verse 1 says
[1:19:31] in Jesus six days before the Passover
[1:19:33] came to Bethany where Lazarus which
[1:19:37] was uh was which had been dead whom he
[1:19:40] raised from the dead there they had made
[1:19:42] him a supper and Martha served
[1:19:44] but Lazarus was one of them that sat at
[1:19:46] the table with him and then took Mary a
[1:19:49] pound of ointment of spikenard
[1:19:52] very costly
[1:19:56] I don't think there's a there's a wasted
[1:19:58] word in the Bible
[1:19:59] so if it says that this was costly
[1:20:01] there's a reason why it says that an
[1:20:03] anointed the feat of Jesus and wiped his
[1:20:07] feet with her hair and listen now and
[1:20:09] the house was filled with the odor of
[1:20:13] the ointment
[1:20:15] and brother Brandon preaches on this
[1:20:17] this other woman he says that this oil
[1:20:19] this oil was so costly and he describes
[1:20:23] how this oil was made about from the
[1:20:25] little bud of a flower and how they
[1:20:27] grind it up and they crush it up and
[1:20:29] they put it in this oil and it was very
[1:20:31] costly you know I I did a little bit of
[1:20:33] research I wouldn't say too much but a
[1:20:35] little bit of research and and somewhere
[1:20:37] in today's money value
[1:20:39] this oil costs there's there's
[1:20:42] estimations between 20 and 50 thousand
[1:20:46] dollars
[1:20:47] in today's money I I we won't get into
[1:20:49] politics it's probably worth much more
[1:20:51] than that today
[1:20:55] that was that was a that was a political
[1:20:57] I'd say I wouldn't get into it but you
[1:21:00] got it
[1:21:03] maybe that's why the estimates range so
[1:21:05] far brother Dan from 20 to 50 000 it's
[1:21:07] like the same amount of money today but
[1:21:08] anyways
[1:21:09] twenty thousand dollars picture that
[1:21:11] twenty thousand dollars to go and
[1:21:13] purchase this
[1:21:16] to pour it on Jesus's feet
[1:21:19] now you could say now we look at the
[1:21:21] story and we say well brother that that
[1:21:22] that makes perfect sense
[1:21:24] if I were there
[1:21:27] I would have bought that oil and I would
[1:21:29] have poured it on his feet
[1:21:32] and whenever I catch myself doing that
[1:21:35] with a with a Bible story I I
[1:21:37] immediately asked myself but what am I
[1:21:39] doing today
[1:21:40] am I doing that same thing today and if
[1:21:43] I'm if I'm not doing it today I most
[1:21:46] likely would not be doing it back in the
[1:21:48] Bible
[1:21:49] brother I would never I would never talk
[1:21:52] like some of the people in the Bible
[1:21:53] talk behind Jesus's back but you know if
[1:21:56] we're doing that today we would be doing
[1:21:58] it back then well brother I would not
[1:22:00] doubt the Miracles I would see somebody
[1:22:02] brought to life I would not doubt who
[1:22:04] Jesus is but if we're doing that today
[1:22:06] we would have done it back then Lord I
[1:22:09] would have love for everyone all the
[1:22:12] disciples all those all the people
[1:22:14] around me I would have love for the
[1:22:15] Romans but if we're not doing it today
[1:22:18] we wouldn't have done it back then
[1:22:22] and he poured it out on his feet and I
[1:22:24] love this the odor of this perfume it
[1:22:26] was so strong it says you know they were
[1:22:28] there to it says there that they were
[1:22:30] there to eat
[1:22:32] now I imagine that house smelled pretty
[1:22:33] good
[1:22:35] I imagine that the food cooking and the
[1:22:37] aroma of that food just filled that
[1:22:39] house you know like when mom makes food
[1:22:42] when your wife makes food when you just
[1:22:45] have good good home cooking but this
[1:22:47] perfume was so strong this oil that it
[1:22:50] it covered all that up and it says the
[1:22:52] odor of it just filled the whole house
[1:22:54] and there's something about that that
[1:22:55] just I don't it just grabs my attention
[1:22:58] about how special and how just how
[1:23:02] special this oil was
[1:23:04] and that this and that this this sister
[1:23:07] would would think there's nothing too
[1:23:09] great
[1:23:10] for me to give to God
[1:23:16] do you mind if we read another scripture
[1:23:17] about the same thing you know I don't
[1:23:19] believe the Bible has any contradictions
[1:23:21] do you
[1:23:23] know when I read another when I read
[1:23:24] when I read the Bible and it's it it has
[1:23:27] another perspective of the same story
[1:23:28] and maybe they don't exactly align you
[1:23:30] know I think maybe that was just uh that
[1:23:33] brother was in another corner of the
[1:23:34] room looking at it from another
[1:23:35] Direction amen
[1:23:37] you know and I've brought this example
[1:23:38] up maybe several times I think brother
[1:23:40] Dana brought it up in that ministers
[1:23:41] meeting but sometimes uh perspective
[1:23:44] makes a big difference and how we treat
[1:23:46] somebody that has another perspective
[1:23:48] than us I you know I don't even know
[1:23:50] what's on that front of that Pulpit
[1:23:51] brother Dan is it a cross
[1:23:54] but but I can't see
[1:23:59] no there's no cross on this pulpit
[1:24:04] nope
[1:24:05] is there a cross
[1:24:06] well you know what you're off the word
[1:24:10] brother I'm looking at it and there's no
[1:24:13] cross on this pulpit
[1:24:15] perspective
[1:24:17] and and what I do with you really says
[1:24:21] more about me
[1:24:22] how I treat you for having a different
[1:24:24] perspective of this object how much more
[1:24:27] the Bible how much more the message how
[1:24:30] much more the word of God when somebody
[1:24:31] sees something that we don't agree with
[1:24:33] how do we treat them
[1:24:37] while they're wrong they're wrong but
[1:24:38] it's just it's not it's not there I've
[1:24:41] looked in the message I've looked in the
[1:24:42] Bible I just can't find it it's not
[1:24:43] there maybe it's just a perspective
[1:24:46] yeah and you know sometimes the Lord has
[1:24:47] has brought somebody through a trial
[1:24:49] that you haven't been through
[1:24:51] and through that trial through that
[1:24:53] experience they have a different
[1:24:54] perspective of God that maybe we need to
[1:24:57] have
[1:24:59] or maybe we should say you know what I'm
[1:25:00] going to accept the way you look at it
[1:25:02] and I'm going to treat you as though you
[1:25:04] are a child of God
[1:25:07] and if we're doing it today we would
[1:25:09] have done it back then
[1:25:12] and so I look at this story it's in
[1:25:14] Matthew 26 it's another perspective of
[1:25:17] the same story
[1:25:19] Matthew 26 verse 6. I'll I'll try to
[1:25:22] try to move forward a little bit so I
[1:25:24] don't keep you here too long
[1:25:27] now in Jesus verse 6 of chapter 26
[1:25:30] Matthew when Jesus was in Bethany the
[1:25:32] house of Simon the leper there came unto
[1:25:33] him a woman
[1:25:35] the other one says it was Mary now a
[1:25:37] woman comes to him having an hour
[1:25:39] bastard box a very precious ointment and
[1:25:42] poured it on his head as he sat at me
[1:25:44] the other one said he poured it on his
[1:25:45] feet
[1:25:46] do I think the Bible contradicts itself
[1:25:49] no I gotta dig deeper into the word to
[1:25:52] find out where these connect
[1:25:54] when the disciples saw it now now they
[1:25:56] didn't talk about this in the other
[1:25:57] scripture when the disciples saw it they
[1:26:00] had indignation
[1:26:05] saying to what purpose is this waste
[1:26:10] for this ointment might have been sold
[1:26:11] for much and given to the poor
[1:26:13] we could have sold that for fifty
[1:26:15] thousand dollars and maybe uh fixed up
[1:26:17] the church a little bit or maybe paid
[1:26:19] for some right
[1:26:21] that's what they were thinking and when
[1:26:23] Jesus understood it he said unto them
[1:26:25] why trouble ye the woman for she hath
[1:26:27] wrought a good work upon me for ye have
[1:26:31] the poor always with you but me you have
[1:26:33] not always for in that she poured this
[1:26:37] ointment on my body she did it for my
[1:26:40] burial she didn't even know why she was
[1:26:41] doing it he said but she didn't know
[1:26:44] that six days later he would be marched
[1:26:46] up to Calvary
[1:26:49] and listen to this this I love this
[1:26:51] verse now verily I say to you
[1:26:53] wheresoever this gospel shall be
[1:26:56] preached in the whole world
[1:26:59] wheresoever this gospel shall be
[1:27:01] preached in the whole world what this
[1:27:04] woman has done will be told for a
[1:27:06] memorial of her
[1:27:08] and here we are two thousand years later
[1:27:10] talking about a woman who went and
[1:27:13] anointed Jesus's feet two thousand years
[1:27:16] later you know what we're doing we're
[1:27:17] still talking about what she did
[1:27:19] you know what Jesus is saying to her
[1:27:21] he's saying what you have done to me I
[1:27:24] will never forget
[1:27:27] think about that being able to do
[1:27:29] something for the Lord
[1:27:31] that he would never forget
[1:27:34] is that your desire
[1:27:37] that's my desire
[1:27:39] not for me not to do it so that I'm not
[1:27:41] know that he would remember me
[1:27:45] that he would know who I am I wonder
[1:27:47] what kind of what kind of service we
[1:27:49] would have if our desire was truly to do
[1:27:52] something for the Lord that he would
[1:27:54] never forgive
[1:27:55] to do the Lord a service
[1:27:57] that's what he wants
[1:28:03] and yet there was disciples standing by
[1:28:06] these disciples walked with him
[1:28:09] they cast out devils
[1:28:11] they healed the sick they watched him
[1:28:13] raise people from the dead and when they
[1:28:16] saw this woman come and pour this
[1:28:18] ointment on his feet they stood by with
[1:28:21] indignation
[1:28:23] not on me to yell at you but but I got
[1:28:26] to include myself in this message have I
[1:28:28] been have I had indignation when I've
[1:28:31] seen somebody come to the Lord and do
[1:28:33] something for him that maybe I didn't
[1:28:35] think they deserved to do
[1:28:38] that maybe I thought well if anybody was
[1:28:41] to annoying his feet it should be me I'm
[1:28:43] I'm a I'm a believer I'm a disciple who
[1:28:46] is this woman that come in and wasting
[1:28:48] the soil indignation is how they looked
[1:28:50] at this
[1:28:52] and you say oh well that's you know
[1:28:53] that's the disciples can I tell you
[1:28:55] something
[1:28:56] you know when we read when we read the
[1:28:58] Bible scripture and this is you could
[1:28:59] you could say I don't really do this but
[1:29:02] I don't know
[1:29:04] when we read the Bible scriptures and
[1:29:06] there's characters in these Bibles uh I
[1:29:08] think almost all the time in our mind we
[1:29:10] start putting faces on those characters
[1:29:13] right
[1:29:14] okay we just read a story about a
[1:29:16] Pharisee
[1:29:18] and a woman
[1:29:19] and Jesus and onlookers and a lot of
[1:29:21] times if we're not careful we'll start
[1:29:23] putting a face of a person that we know
[1:29:26] on that Pharisee
[1:29:29] you ever done that I'm the only one
[1:29:31] you ever you ever heard a message
[1:29:33] preached and you preach it in your mind
[1:29:35] to somebody else
[1:29:37] that's the best way I could I could I
[1:29:39] could say that you hear something you go
[1:29:40] oh brother I know who needs to hear that
[1:29:42] brother Dan
[1:29:43] if they were only here this morning
[1:29:46] I'll have to tell them to go listen to
[1:29:47] the message
[1:29:49] you ever given somebody a tape oh if
[1:29:51] they can only hear this tape brother
[1:29:52] Brown just hit so again right
[1:29:54] sometimes we we preach a message that's
[1:29:57] preached to somebody else when God's
[1:29:59] saying no no no I wanted you to hear it
[1:30:03] I wanted you to hear oh no Lord I don't
[1:30:05] I don't struggle with this I don't
[1:30:07] struggle with that but the Lord said no
[1:30:08] no I sent that message to be preached to
[1:30:11] you and you're sitting here I ordain the
[1:30:13] whole thing it's for you
[1:30:16] but I you know that's okay that's a hard
[1:30:18] pill to swallow right and I want to tell
[1:30:20] you what if you want to read the Bible
[1:30:22] in a new way now I'm young I don't know
[1:30:23] how to tell all of you how to read the
[1:30:25] Bible but here's something you could try
[1:30:26] you know that instead of you know I call
[1:30:29] it casting the roles you have the roles
[1:30:31] of the character you have the indignant
[1:30:32] Pharisee over here you have the humble
[1:30:34] woman washing his feet you know I think
[1:30:36] a lot of times we put ourselves as the
[1:30:37] humble sinner right
[1:30:40] it's okay if you don't say man it's all
[1:30:42] right
[1:30:43] sometimes we put ourselves oh brother
[1:30:45] just like I told you oh I I identify
[1:30:48] with that sinner right who came to Jesus
[1:30:51] but you know what I'm also that Pharisee
[1:30:56] that hurts sometimes
[1:30:59] I'm also
[1:31:00] that indignant disciples sometimes
[1:31:05] you know sometimes when you haven't been
[1:31:07] close to the Lord sister I enjoyed that
[1:31:09] special about praying maybe when you
[1:31:11] haven't prayed to the Lord and you see
[1:31:12] somebody else getting blessed
[1:31:15] you ever get a little indignant about it
[1:31:18] you ever wonder why someone else
[1:31:19] deserves to be blessed and you see them
[1:31:21] go they're not even living brother
[1:31:23] brother Dan they don't even go to church
[1:31:24] all the time
[1:31:26] now I know this is true you don't have
[1:31:28] to I know it's true
[1:31:30] they don't even make every service I
[1:31:31] don't miss a service and I see them over
[1:31:33] there getting blessed
[1:31:35] they probably don't even pray as hard as
[1:31:37] I do and they're the over getting you
[1:31:38] know what we're doing there's a Pharisee
[1:31:40] spirit that we have to battle and that
[1:31:44] we have to defeat you say oh brother I
[1:31:46] defeated that Spirit no no it's a daily
[1:31:49] battle
[1:31:49] it's a daily battle to get rid of that
[1:31:52] that Pharisee inside or that disciple
[1:31:54] inside I said Lord I've been a message
[1:31:56] believer for 10 years and somebody can
[1:31:58] just come in and get no I don't think we
[1:32:00] would ever say this right but sometimes
[1:32:01] our attitude says this
[1:32:04] indignant and if it's not true then I
[1:32:07] don't know why it would be in the Bible
[1:32:09] you know the Bible isn't just stories I
[1:32:11] don't think it's coincidence it's in the
[1:32:13] Bible to show us what we have to battle
[1:32:15] against
[1:32:17] right
[1:32:21] but he wants a service done for him I
[1:32:23] just I just want to just stay on that
[1:32:24] point though where you know
[1:32:27] I wonder if I wonder what kind of people
[1:32:30] I would we would be I'll just point it
[1:32:32] to myself I wonder what kind of
[1:32:33] Christian I would be if you know those
[1:32:35] that I disagree with and disagree with
[1:32:37] me if I would start putting them as that
[1:32:39] sinner that was forgiven
[1:32:43] you know maybe some of you doesn't just
[1:32:45] see the message just the way that I see
[1:32:46] it maybe it's just perspective
[1:32:48] they just don't see it they're
[1:32:51] different way and I put them as the
[1:32:53] disciple I put them as the Pharisee I
[1:32:54] put them out there what if I started to
[1:32:56] put them as The Sinner who is Forgiven
[1:32:58] and then put myself in the place of the
[1:33:00] critic
[1:33:02] I bet you it would change the way that
[1:33:03] we do things I bet you we would change
[1:33:06] the way that I speak to that person
[1:33:09] fellowship with that person that's a
[1:33:11] hard one
[1:33:13] wouldn't you want to fellowship with
[1:33:15] someone who had been forgiven by Jesus I
[1:33:17] sure would
[1:33:19] but in order to not fellowship with
[1:33:21] somebody and this is this is going to
[1:33:22] cut but this is the truth in order to
[1:33:24] not fellowship with somebody who doesn't
[1:33:26] believe just like you you know you
[1:33:27] actually have to de-christianize them in
[1:33:29] your mind
[1:33:32] that that's that's hard but that's the
[1:33:34] truth
[1:33:35] you have to actually in your in your in
[1:33:37] your thoughts in your mind say you know
[1:33:38] what they're just not there
[1:33:42] Lord if you would just help them be
[1:33:44] there if you just help them see it and
[1:33:46] the Lord is saying I want you to see
[1:33:48] something
[1:33:49] I want you to change
[1:33:52] because you listen now you were not
[1:33:56] looking for him when he found you
[1:34:00] you weren't
[1:34:01] you said oh I was seeking god brother I
[1:34:03] was at the end of my rope no he led he
[1:34:06] drew you to him what brought you to the
[1:34:10] end of your rope he did
[1:34:12] what brought you to desperation that
[1:34:15] without him you would have died he
[1:34:17] brought you there
[1:34:20] if I serve God it's because he's called
[1:34:23] me to serve him and allowed me to serve
[1:34:25] him and chosen me to serve him not
[1:34:27] because I decided to
[1:34:30] if there's any good thing that we do
[1:34:33] it's him
[1:34:34] and if we if we can't see that we'll
[1:34:37] become an indignant disciple
[1:34:41] think about that since when has the feet
[1:34:44] of Jesus become a place where you could
[1:34:47] get mad at somebody for going to
[1:34:53] since when is the altar call been a
[1:34:56] place where just new people come to
[1:35:01] no I'm just getting brother Dan I hope
[1:35:02] it's okay to say but I I think I think
[1:35:05] who needs to be at the altar the most
[1:35:07] are ministers
[1:35:10] pastors
[1:35:12] evangelists
[1:35:14] 40-year Christians 30-year Christians
[1:35:17] 20-year Christians that's who needs to
[1:35:19] be at the altar
[1:35:21] that's who needs to be there the most
[1:35:23] The Sinner
[1:35:25] The Sinner doesn't have a problem doing
[1:35:27] that why because they know they're wrong
[1:35:28] and they come and they hear the word of
[1:35:30] God and something convicts them and it
[1:35:33] Pricks their heart but sometimes our
[1:35:35] heart gets so Stony after we become a
[1:35:38] Christian for a long time that God's
[1:35:40] trying to prick our heart and it's just
[1:35:42] it's just Stone
[1:35:45] because we're good
[1:35:47] because we're saved
[1:35:49] because we're message Believers now I'm
[1:35:51] not trying to make you anything that
[1:35:52] you're not I believe you're a believer
[1:35:55] but God is trying to do something new
[1:35:57] for you today
[1:36:00] and I think Lord willing I think we'll
[1:36:03] read about that
[1:36:05] but I tell you I want to do something
[1:36:08] that God will remember
[1:36:11] for all time
[1:36:14] and you know it's just a it's to do a
[1:36:17] service for him now you could go and I
[1:36:19] would encourage you to go listen to the
[1:36:20] message doing God of service without
[1:36:22] being his will brother Brown walks you
[1:36:24] through the five must-haves in order to
[1:36:27] do something for God but let me read you
[1:36:28] what he says
[1:36:31] in in
[1:36:33] beyond the curtain of time he says
[1:36:36] there's one thing I want to be honest
[1:36:38] with you about the thing listen now I
[1:36:42] keep I apologize I'll stop anybody
[1:36:45] pray for healing
[1:36:47] and are waiting on that healing
[1:36:51] do you want you want a formula to
[1:36:53] receive that healing
[1:36:55] he says I want to be honest with you the
[1:36:57] thing the way that God heals
[1:36:59] is on the basis of service to him
[1:37:05] you know I believe that his stripes
[1:37:06] healed you
[1:37:08] they healed you but in order to accept
[1:37:10] the healing he's waiting for a service
[1:37:13] to be done for him you know that he had
[1:37:15] that forgiveness for that for that woman
[1:37:18] he had that forgiveness for her all
[1:37:20] along but what was he waiting for a
[1:37:22] service to be done
[1:37:24] he had told Simon her sins are forgiven
[1:37:27] he hadn't even told her yet
[1:37:29] Simon her sins there are many but she's
[1:37:32] loved much
[1:37:33] and then he turns her and say your sins
[1:37:36] are forgiven but he was waiting for a
[1:37:39] service to be done
[1:37:41] he says that's the way God heals is on
[1:37:44] the basis of service to him see it's on
[1:37:47] the basis of service to him he says it
[1:37:49] twice we must accept our healing
[1:37:52] on the basis that we will serve him
[1:37:55] after we're healed
[1:37:59] now the Bible says confess your faults
[1:38:01] one to another pray for one another that
[1:38:04] you might be healed
[1:38:06] see it's on the basis that you'll serve
[1:38:09] God
[1:38:11] I wonder why you know I I wonder why we
[1:38:14] have to confess our faults to one
[1:38:15] another isn't it easier I know the
[1:38:17] answer to the question but I'm just
[1:38:18] going to ask you isn't it easier just to
[1:38:20] confess them to God and say Lord I'm
[1:38:22] sorry I've done this I'm sorry but when
[1:38:24] I have to go to brother Dan and say
[1:38:26] brother Dan this is what I was saying
[1:38:28] about somebody today
[1:38:29] this was the thought that ran through my
[1:38:32] mind today no those that we all want to
[1:38:34] tell each other that right
[1:38:36] that's hard to that sister that's hard
[1:38:38] to do right because you know why because
[1:38:40] we have built up an image of ourself
[1:38:44] as a Christian
[1:38:46] and to tell somebody that you've done
[1:38:49] something that you think is terrible is
[1:38:51] to try to tear that image down a little
[1:38:53] bit
[1:38:55] when that's exactly what God wants you
[1:38:56] to do
[1:39:00] I I just preach to myself because that's
[1:39:02] true I have a hard time
[1:39:04] confessing my faults to somebody else
[1:39:07] you know when I tell it to God I don't
[1:39:09] have to see God's face
[1:39:11] and his reaction
[1:39:14] in ways it's easier to tell God what
[1:39:16] you've done wrong it is to tell somebody
[1:39:17] else
[1:39:19] and that's exactly why the Bible says
[1:39:21] confess it to somebody else
[1:39:25] he says but you know there's something
[1:39:27] inside of her telling her to go in
[1:39:30] she wanted to do a service for Jesus and
[1:39:33] if you're wanting to do a service for
[1:39:35] Jesus there ain't enough Bishops and
[1:39:38] Cardinals on Earth to stop you from
[1:39:41] getting in his presence
[1:39:43] you say brother there's not Bishops and
[1:39:45] Cardinals on Earth I'll tell you where
[1:39:46] the Bishops and Cardinals are at
[1:39:48] right here
[1:39:50] again I could I could put a face to that
[1:39:52] or I could put my my face on that and
[1:39:54] say you know what stops me from going
[1:39:56] and and and before the feet of Jesus Is
[1:39:59] Me
[1:40:01] I'm the Cardinal I'm the bishop I'm the
[1:40:04] self-righteous the two holy
[1:40:07] to go and be off the altar I'm not
[1:40:09] trying to get you to come to the altar
[1:40:11] that's that's not what this is about
[1:40:15] but but but what stops us from doing a
[1:40:17] service to God Is Us
[1:40:22] that's right there ain't enough
[1:40:23] denomination and hypocrites in the
[1:40:25] country to do it or enough devils and
[1:40:27] hell to stop you from doing it if you're
[1:40:30] wanting to do a service for Jesus
[1:40:33] and I want to tell you this that that go
[1:40:35] that
[1:40:37] I want to say this in the right way
[1:40:39] but you know a lot of times we come to
[1:40:42] service
[1:40:44] we come to church service
[1:40:47] but are we really doing a service for
[1:40:49] him
[1:40:51] what are you doing Sunday morning 10
[1:40:52] o'clock oh I'm going to service
[1:40:55] that's good
[1:40:56] but are you doing a service for him
[1:41:00] am I doing a service or or have I just
[1:41:04] done my duty by coming to church on
[1:41:07] Sunday
[1:41:08] coming my coming to church on Wednesday
[1:41:09] coming to church Sunday night read my
[1:41:12] Bible once a day praying once a day have
[1:41:14] I just done my duty to him
[1:41:18] or does he want more
[1:41:22] I I believe that the message is the
[1:41:24] truth
[1:41:25] is that enough
[1:41:28] it's not enough
[1:41:32] I know that's I know that's
[1:41:36] I know sometimes that's hard to hear
[1:41:37] right because I'm not I'm not I would
[1:41:40] never stand up here and tell you that
[1:41:41] those things aren't the right thing to
[1:41:43] do they are the right thing to do
[1:41:45] but you know if I would just realize
[1:41:49] that that God has so much more
[1:41:52] so much more
[1:41:56] I'll tell you this is just this isn't
[1:41:57] deep this is just about as simple as it
[1:41:59] gets but but you know the simple things
[1:42:01] are the hard things to do
[1:42:04] the simple things
[1:42:06] you know I'm gonna read this this um
[1:42:09] we're doing okay I actually I I have a
[1:42:13] watch and I have this and I still forgot
[1:42:14] to look at the clock before I started
[1:42:17] I want to read this quote if you can
[1:42:19] because I I this came on my heart so
[1:42:21] strong last night I had to search took
[1:42:23] me a little while to find it and then
[1:42:24] this morning here it is I won't tell you
[1:42:26] the whole thing but this morning the
[1:42:27] Lord used this quote to straighten me
[1:42:30] out this morning
[1:42:31] here I am I'm going to come and and
[1:42:33] minister to to a group of Believers and
[1:42:36] the Lord's like not right now you're not
[1:42:39] nope I I got some changing I need to do
[1:42:42] on you this morning
[1:42:44] and he says this it's in the Great
[1:42:46] Commission this is one of my favorite
[1:42:49] quotes and I I remembered how he said it
[1:42:51] but I had to go look it up and he says
[1:42:52] you know if you want to be a blessing
[1:42:55] and get a blessing
[1:42:57] when a man has done you wrong
[1:43:01] and he absolutely justly I mean he has
[1:43:05] done you wrong and you know that he's
[1:43:07] done you wrong he's done you evil
[1:43:10] don't mention that
[1:43:15] that means you don't call up someone and
[1:43:18] say I'm going to tell you I'm going to
[1:43:20] tell you something I need you to pray
[1:43:21] for this brother or sister
[1:43:23] right that's like another way to gossip
[1:43:27] let me tell you about this brother and
[1:43:28] then would you pray for him but no
[1:43:30] brother I'm saying don't do that
[1:43:34] he says don't mention that
[1:43:36] you take him to prayer before God
[1:43:41] and don't take this in a way of just
[1:43:43] selfish and say well I'm supposed to do
[1:43:46] this
[1:43:47] but stand
[1:43:49] with your shoulder to his shoulder and
[1:43:52] stand in the presence of God our Father
[1:43:54] the way a prayer should be made in that
[1:43:57] presence and say father here's my
[1:43:59] brother and he is justly he deserves
[1:44:02] punishment because he has done me evil
[1:44:05] and I don't see why he did it
[1:44:08] and then let God go to talking to you
[1:44:12] and you'll see maybe what that man's
[1:44:15] been through
[1:44:19] and the devil has Twisted him up
[1:44:21] somewhere and caused him to do that
[1:44:25] and though he's absolutely wrong
[1:44:29] before you leave the Throne of God
[1:44:31] you'll be feeling sorry for that man
[1:44:36] you'll be sympathizing with that brother
[1:44:38] when you get back down here to Earth
[1:44:40] you'll go over to that brother and shake
[1:44:43] his hand because you know what he's been
[1:44:45] through now listen you cannot stand with
[1:44:49] a mortal in the presence of God and
[1:44:51] condemn anybody
[1:44:55] I don't believe no sir even a rank
[1:44:58] sinner
[1:45:00] you know I I've said you know we we we
[1:45:03] talk about the presence of God and
[1:45:05] certainly when we have a worship service
[1:45:07] you can feel it even this morning you
[1:45:09] feel his presence come down when we hear
[1:45:11] a word of God preach his presence comes
[1:45:13] but I wonder how many of us has actually
[1:45:15] entered into a presence of God
[1:45:18] because if I look at myself and if I'm
[1:45:20] condemning somebody I can tell you by
[1:45:22] the word of God I'm not in his presence
[1:45:25] now his presence might be all over the
[1:45:27] building it might be healing this person
[1:45:29] it might be performing a miracle but if
[1:45:31] I have a condemning Spirit towards
[1:45:34] somebody I can tell you this I haven't
[1:45:35] entered into that presence
[1:45:37] I might pray every day I might read my
[1:45:39] Bible every day but if I'm starting to
[1:45:41] condemn even a rank sinner I'll tell you
[1:45:43] what I'm not in the presence of God
[1:45:47] and that presence of God is what brings
[1:45:50] out the life that's in US
[1:45:53] you know I I always think about Aaron's
[1:45:56] Rod you know Aaron's Rod was used
[1:45:59] so many times by Moses and Aaron to
[1:46:02] perform Miracles right
[1:46:04] stretch out your rod and this will
[1:46:06] happen touch this and with your rod and
[1:46:08] this will happen that Rod was used in
[1:46:10] service to God
[1:46:12] but still had to come into the holiest
[1:46:14] of holies in order for uh for for life
[1:46:17] to come forth from what was a dead stick
[1:46:21] life had to come why it had to come into
[1:46:24] the presence of God to get rid of that
[1:46:26] condemning Spirit to get rid of that
[1:46:28] self-righteous spirit that Pharisee
[1:46:30] Spirit it had to come into the presence
[1:46:32] of God before it really even though it
[1:46:34] had been used by God before it could
[1:46:36] actually become part of God and have a
[1:46:38] life of God had to come into His
[1:46:40] presence
[1:46:41] that's what I want this morning
[1:46:43] Lord remove from me anything that
[1:46:46] inhibits me from coming into your
[1:46:48] presence this morning and uh oh Lord
[1:46:50] take away my sin but take away my
[1:46:53] judgment of The Sinner
[1:46:56] the more you get there now I'm not
[1:46:58] brother Brown's not calling wrong right
[1:47:01] he's he's saying that brother was wrong
[1:47:03] but taken before the Lord and watched
[1:47:06] the Lord start to talk to you
[1:47:08] watch the Lord's her say you know what
[1:47:10] you think he's the Pharisee in the story
[1:47:12] but he's not
[1:47:14] he's The Sinner
[1:47:17] what are you going to be
[1:47:24] you know there's a lot of there's a lot
[1:47:26] of that
[1:47:27] of of that that sinner who washed his
[1:47:30] feet there's a lot of that in me you
[1:47:32] know there's a lot of prodigal son in me
[1:47:36] now I don't know about you there's a lot
[1:47:38] of you know a lot of times there's a
[1:47:40] little doubting Thomas in there
[1:47:42] it's easy to say oh doubting Thomas I
[1:47:44] know who that is
[1:47:46] yeah it's me
[1:47:48] you know what about what about the
[1:47:50] ungrateful leper
[1:47:53] there's a lot of that in me sometimes I
[1:47:55] battle
[1:47:58] we read the Bible about a man possessed
[1:48:00] cutting himself
[1:48:03] we battled that
[1:48:08] and God is trying to teach us through
[1:48:09] his word that those those Temptations
[1:48:12] those weaknesses they lie in US
[1:48:16] and if you say no no they don't lie in
[1:48:18] me watch out
[1:48:20] he might he might take you through a
[1:48:22] little trial so he can bring you up on
[1:48:23] the other side
[1:48:25] and say look without me you would be
[1:48:28] that man cutting himself without me you
[1:48:30] would be that sinner without me you
[1:48:32] would be that Pharisee
[1:48:34] without me you would be that Prodigal
[1:48:36] Son
[1:48:38] and Not only would be
[1:48:40] you were
[1:48:44] you were that
[1:48:45] I just want to move forward if that's
[1:48:47] okay we're just to read another
[1:48:49] well you know I really wanted to talk
[1:48:50] about I it took so long to get there
[1:48:54] really wanted to talk about this this
[1:48:56] Alabaster Box
[1:48:58] and maybe maybe I'll just do this in in
[1:49:01] the closing part of this
[1:49:05] you know the alabaster boxes it's in
[1:49:08] both stories
[1:49:11] and it's a box that that contained
[1:49:14] the oil
[1:49:18] and and brother Brown goes into how much
[1:49:20] that cost
[1:49:21] and he says they took that Alabaster Box
[1:49:23] and they and they poured it on his feet
[1:49:26] and I started to think okay let's let's
[1:49:28] look into the alabaster a little bit and
[1:49:31] and again just doing a little bit of
[1:49:32] research I'm not the expert in Alabaster
[1:49:34] but it's it's actually made of uh of a
[1:49:38] material brother Dan that's it's similar
[1:49:40] to gypsum and and and calcium or calcite
[1:49:44] it's actually
[1:49:45] it's actually not valuable
[1:49:48] it's very common
[1:49:50] but the reason why it was used we just
[1:49:52] get a little history lesson here if
[1:49:53] that's okay
[1:49:54] the reason why I was used is because you
[1:49:57] could easily form it into what you
[1:49:59] wanted
[1:50:00] you could take this you could take this
[1:50:03] Alabaster and and there's still pieces
[1:50:05] and museums that have lasted thousands
[1:50:07] of years of this Alabaster so it's
[1:50:10] durable in one sense but in other sense
[1:50:12] you could start to carve on it
[1:50:13] you could start to you could you could
[1:50:15] make it into a real nice ornament and
[1:50:17] then I've seen some of the stuff they've
[1:50:19] done and you think there's no way they
[1:50:20] carved that from this but they it's it's
[1:50:22] pliable
[1:50:24] it's soft
[1:50:26] and it's also capable of holding in this
[1:50:29] oil and not letting
[1:50:31] no free smells
[1:50:34] you can't go into the shop where they
[1:50:35] sell the oil and get a free smell
[1:50:38] this Alabaster could hold in that
[1:50:41] precious ointment that costs so much
[1:50:43] and keep it fresh keep it secure
[1:50:48] and you know I I want to make the point
[1:50:50] that this the reason why this this
[1:50:52] service for Jesus was so costly was not
[1:50:55] because of the alabaster
[1:50:57] it was because of the ointment that was
[1:50:59] inside of it
[1:51:05] and as long as you take this Alabaster
[1:51:07] Box for the day and you keep it safe and
[1:51:09] you keep it protected it will last and
[1:51:11] keep that oil fresh
[1:51:14] it'll hold it for weeks
[1:51:18] years even decades and it will be fresh
[1:51:22] and he said that's that's pretty good
[1:51:26] but I want you to know that the
[1:51:27] alabaster is another character in this
[1:51:29] story
[1:51:31] the alabaster box
[1:51:36] and it's me
[1:51:38] you say well brother I'm
[1:51:40] I'm The Sinner yes you're also The
[1:51:42] Sinner
[1:51:44] but that Alabaster Box
[1:51:48] it's you
[1:51:50] it's your heart
[1:51:53] it's it's
[1:51:55] your image
[1:51:57] as a believer in a Christian
[1:52:03] it holds in the precious oil of the Holy
[1:52:06] Spirit
[1:52:09] it contains it
[1:52:12] now I don't know if you've had an
[1:52:14] experience with the Lord I don't know I
[1:52:16] don't know hardly anybody here so I
[1:52:19] can't speak for you
[1:52:20] but if you've had an experience with the
[1:52:22] Lord and he's filled you with his holy
[1:52:24] spirit
[1:52:26] that's what's holding it
[1:52:28] if you haven't had an experience with
[1:52:30] the Lord
[1:52:31] you know he wants to give it to you more
[1:52:34] than you want to have it
[1:52:40] the problem is is that the alabaster box
[1:52:43] sometimes has become more valuable
[1:52:47] than the oil that it holds
[1:52:51] and when I look at myself I I don't I'm
[1:52:54] not judging you I'm judging myself as
[1:52:56] somebody who
[1:52:58] has has been a believer
[1:53:01] for most of their life
[1:53:05] the longer we are believers and the
[1:53:08] longer we are Christians the more
[1:53:11] beautiful and decorative that box gets
[1:53:16] the more we start to carve on it rather
[1:53:19] Dan and make it into what we think a
[1:53:22] Christian should look like
[1:53:26] set some gems
[1:53:28] in the corners
[1:53:32] I don't think any of us give us any
[1:53:33] credit right we don't give ourselves
[1:53:34] credit but sometimes the way that I act
[1:53:38] I act like somebody who forgot where God
[1:53:40] took them from
[1:53:42] I act and I see a sinner
[1:53:45] at his feet
[1:53:48] and think
[1:53:50] they don't deserve to be there
[1:53:54] now maybe that's just me and maybe this
[1:53:56] is for me this morning
[1:53:57] but the longer I'm a Christian the more
[1:54:00] this box gets carved and decorated
[1:54:04] and it looks better and better the
[1:54:06] longer I'm a Christian
[1:54:09] and you know this is I hope this is okay
[1:54:11] but this is not a problem for the center
[1:54:13] off the street
[1:54:14] it's not a problem for them
[1:54:17] they might have a different problem
[1:54:19] but this is a problem for the seasoned
[1:54:22] believer
[1:54:24] this is a problem for the veteran
[1:54:26] believer this is a problem for those of
[1:54:29] us that maybe gave our heart to the Lord
[1:54:31] years and years ago that's who that's
[1:54:34] who struggles with this problem
[1:54:37] that's the problem of pride
[1:54:42] you know rarely is a sinner proud
[1:54:44] but Christians are proud
[1:54:48] that Pharisee Spirit gets in there
[1:54:51] starts to make you feel puffed up will
[1:54:53] you see where the Lord has taken you
[1:54:55] from
[1:54:56] and if for a moment I forget that it's
[1:54:59] not because of me
[1:55:01] I start to feel good about myself
[1:55:03] I start to feel a little oh you know
[1:55:04] what I'm doing good that's a mistake
[1:55:06] right there
[1:55:08] Lord if I if I fall today Lord
[1:55:12] would you be gracious to pick me up
[1:55:17] the longer you're a Christian the longer
[1:55:19] your image as one gets more and more
[1:55:23] perfected and honed
[1:55:25] but but God doesn't want that kind of
[1:55:27] Christian
[1:55:31] he doesn't want that because he doesn't
[1:55:34] want
[1:55:35] the alabaster box
[1:55:38] he wants the ointment inside the
[1:55:40] alabaster box
[1:55:42] what is that ointment
[1:55:44] it's my service
[1:55:46] it's my service to him
[1:55:48] it's my Mercy for somebody
[1:55:51] it's my grace for somebody it's my
[1:55:54] forgiveness for that person who has done
[1:55:58] me absolutely wrong
[1:56:00] and as long as it's held inside it will
[1:56:02] stay there for years and years and I'll
[1:56:04] sit in a Pew and I'll come to service
[1:56:06] service in service out sing songs and my
[1:56:10] alabaster box juice gets more and more
[1:56:12] ornate and beautiful
[1:56:15] but that's not what God wants
[1:56:17] you'd be okay if I I don't want to spill
[1:56:20] some of this water but
[1:56:22] I'll drink some of it so the the folks
[1:56:24] that clean the church don't have a big
[1:56:26] mess but
[1:56:28] he don't I think that sometimes
[1:56:31] I just preached myself a little bit but
[1:56:33] I think sometimes when I come
[1:56:35] this is I serve God like this
[1:56:41] there's a little bit of that ointment a
[1:56:43] little bit of that oil
[1:56:44] oh lord it's it's so costly brother Dan
[1:56:47] I don't want to use it all up
[1:56:50] this is just a regular Sunday right it's
[1:56:52] not a special service it's not meetings
[1:56:55] I barely made it today
[1:56:59] right you know what I mean
[1:57:03] you know what I mean I barely made it
[1:57:05] here today
[1:57:06] brother I'm gonna I'm gonna hold that in
[1:57:08] I'm gonna hold it and sometimes we come
[1:57:10] to the feet of Jesus
[1:57:12] and we do this
[1:57:15] there you go Lord a little bit of oil
[1:57:20] I I tell you I've been guilty of that
[1:57:24] there's another
[1:57:26] there's another uh perspective of this
[1:57:29] story in mark
[1:57:32] 14 3 says
[1:57:35] and being in Bethany in the house of
[1:57:36] Simon the leper he sat at me
[1:57:39] and there came a woman having an
[1:57:40] alabaster box of ointment of spikenard
[1:57:43] very precious
[1:57:44] and she broke the Box
[1:57:51] she broke the box and poured it on his
[1:57:55] head
[1:57:58] brother Ram talks about this woman in
[1:58:00] that Pharisees house and he said she
[1:58:01] didn't just give him a little bit of
[1:58:03] this oil
[1:58:04] he said she she poured it all
[1:58:07] she poured all the oil a drop of that
[1:58:11] oil just to drop would have made that
[1:58:14] whole house smell and yet she took
[1:58:18] I hate to get your floor wet brother Dan
[1:58:21] she said Lord you get all of it
[1:58:25] all of it
[1:58:27] break the Box
[1:58:30] that's how I want to serve him
[1:58:33] that's how I want to serve him this
[1:58:34] morning and you could say oh brother
[1:58:36] that sounds good but do we do it
[1:58:39] do we do it
[1:58:41] do we take ourself that image the image
[1:58:45] of ourself that we've built up we've
[1:58:48] built up as a Christian as a message
[1:58:49] believer
[1:58:51] and do we just crack it open a little
[1:58:52] bit and go here you go Lord I'll give
[1:58:54] you back a little bit of what you gave
[1:58:55] me but I better keep this other one in
[1:58:57] we got meetings coming up and oh you
[1:58:59] know what Lord I'll give it all to you
[1:59:00] at those meetings
[1:59:05] he doesn't want that
[1:59:08] that's not the kind of believer he wants
[1:59:10] that's not the kind of service that God
[1:59:12] wants the kind of service he wants is
[1:59:15] for you to take everything that you are
[1:59:17] both good and bad and break it
[1:59:22] and break it I don't you know I I know
[1:59:24] that the Lord has done things for you
[1:59:26] but he today wants to take that image of
[1:59:29] you and break it
[1:59:32] you have to do that you have to Lord I
[1:59:34] come to you and Lord you saved me so
[1:59:36] many years ago yeah but today you are a
[1:59:40] sweet smelling Savor to him if he can
[1:59:43] save you today
[1:59:46] and I think so many times we're we're
[1:59:48] operating off of an experience from
[1:59:51] yesterday or many yesterdays ago
[1:59:54] when today and Lord we bring our we
[1:59:56] bring ourselves to church I know I do I
[1:59:59] bring myself to church as a holy
[2:00:01] Christian as a good message believer and
[2:00:03] that's not what the Lord wants you know
[2:00:06] what the Lord wants a broken and
[2:00:09] contrite heart
[2:00:12] he doesn't want an alabaster box that's
[2:00:15] not what's valuable
[2:00:18] although it's it's pliable and although
[2:00:20] it's ornate and all these things but we
[2:00:22] spread that service sometimes over a few
[2:00:24] Services over a few months you know
[2:00:26] sometimes we get that oil we spread it
[2:00:29] over years and years oh I'm almost out
[2:00:31] of it when when the Lord's saying yeah
[2:00:33] but I get I got a fresh refilling for
[2:00:36] you today
[2:00:39] a fresh refilling of the Holy Spirit
[2:00:41] today you don't need
[2:00:44] you don't need to rely on the Manna From
[2:00:47] Yesterday although I gave it to you and
[2:00:49] I fed you and I brought you to this
[2:00:51] point but today I have fresh Manna for
[2:00:55] you today I have fresh oil from you but
[2:00:57] the problem is is I don't have any room
[2:00:59] for it
[2:01:01] because everything he's given me I
[2:01:03] haven't used it up yet
[2:01:06] I haven't given him my service I haven't
[2:01:08] given him My Worship I haven't given
[2:01:10] them my whole heart I've been holding
[2:01:12] forgiveness back from somebody
[2:01:15] and then wonder why I don't get filled
[2:01:17] sometimes with the Holy Spirit I see
[2:01:19] somebody over here getting blessed and I
[2:01:21] see somebody over here where you know
[2:01:22] the Lord's working with him he said Lord
[2:01:24] I want some of that and the Lord's
[2:01:25] saying your box it's full
[2:01:29] your box is full with what I did for you
[2:01:31] yesterday but I want to do something new
[2:01:33] for you today and I can't because you
[2:01:36] have to come to me at my feet and break
[2:01:39] it
[2:01:41] and you know what she had to break it so
[2:01:43] that not one drop brother random says
[2:01:45] not one drop was wasted
[2:01:49] every single drop
[2:01:51] went on his feet
[2:01:54] was it too much it was a lot
[2:01:57] but that's what God wanted
[2:01:59] that's the kind of service that Jesus
[2:02:02] wanted
[2:02:04] he doesn't want he doesn't want your
[2:02:06] image as a Christian he wants what's
[2:02:08] inside there he wants your heart he
[2:02:11] wants your service he wants your
[2:02:12] forgiveness
[2:02:15] I I keep going back to that but when I'm
[2:02:18] withholding forgiveness from somebody
[2:02:21] who has done me wrong I haven't been in
[2:02:23] his presence
[2:02:25] you could say oh Lord I'm doing your
[2:02:27] service but I'm telling you you're not
[2:02:29] doing a service to him
[2:02:31] you might be doing service to a man to a
[2:02:34] Doctrine to a church to yourself to a
[2:02:36] family but you're not doing a service
[2:02:38] for God because if you are coming in the
[2:02:41] presence of God you couldn't condemn
[2:02:43] anybody
[2:02:44] and all that tells me is that Pharisee
[2:02:47] even though he was sitting there next to
[2:02:49] Jesus wasn't in his presence
[2:02:51] because all he thought was what kind of
[2:02:54] woman is that
[2:02:55] and those disciples even though they had
[2:02:57] walked with him
[2:02:59] they hadn't really been in his presence
[2:03:01] right then
[2:03:02] which we know they had to go to an upper
[2:03:04] room
[2:03:05] they really hadn't been in his presence
[2:03:07] because they looked down at Mary who's
[2:03:09] washing his feet and get indignant about
[2:03:11] it
[2:03:15] can I I'll read you a quote and I'll
[2:03:17] finish is that okay this is so this is
[2:03:20] broken up and but it's just it it is
[2:03:22] what it is
[2:03:23] he says the thing of it was now I carry
[2:03:27] this this quote with me everywhere
[2:03:28] because I just love it he says the thing
[2:03:30] of it was was not how she was gonna get
[2:03:32] there
[2:03:35] because right away when you want to do a
[2:03:37] service for God all the obstacles start
[2:03:40] popping up in your place right and I'm
[2:03:42] gonna tell you who puts those obstacles
[2:03:44] there you do
[2:03:47] you say oh the devil
[2:03:49] okay what does he do well I don't you
[2:03:52] know brother Dan I don't want somebody
[2:03:53] to think that
[2:03:55] that I'm not a good Christian
[2:03:58] no you think that
[2:04:00] somebody else doesn't think that brother
[2:04:02] Dan I remember being a service where a
[2:04:04] man that I respected as a minister went
[2:04:07] down to the Altar and was out the altar
[2:04:09] longer than anybody else you know what I
[2:04:10] had more respect for him
[2:04:13] not less respect I never thought once oh
[2:04:16] what is he doing down there what has he
[2:04:17] done wrong I thought there's somebody I
[2:04:20] can have confidence in that's somebody
[2:04:22] who has taken the image of himself and
[2:04:25] said Lord my image as a minister as a
[2:04:27] Christian as a believer that doesn't
[2:04:29] matter I just want more of you
[2:04:31] and Lord to get more of you I need to
[2:04:33] pour out every single thing that you've
[2:04:36] given me not just pour it out I need to
[2:04:39] break this image of myself that I've
[2:04:40] built up he says not how she was going
[2:04:43] to get there she didn't care how she was
[2:04:44] going to get there you know this woman
[2:04:46] she didn't care what anybody thought
[2:04:49] about her
[2:04:51] and I know this is a simple message but
[2:04:52] I'm telling you the thing that stops us
[2:04:54] from doing a service from God is we care
[2:04:56] too much about what someone else thinks
[2:04:59] [Music]
[2:05:01] that I
[2:05:03] that's that's the truth we care too much
[2:05:05] about what somebody else thinks she was
[2:05:08] going to make an effort to get there he
[2:05:09] says I can see her elbowing her way
[2:05:11] through the crowd
[2:05:14] what crowd the church crowd
[2:05:18] right the church crowd
[2:05:21] that's who she was going through there's
[2:05:23] nothing that's going to stop me from
[2:05:25] getting to the feet of Jesus if I really
[2:05:27] want to get there
[2:05:29] he says no matter what she he says no
[2:05:31] matter what said or who said it she was
[2:05:35] on her road to meet Jesus he says do you
[2:05:39] do that
[2:05:42] would you elbow your way through the
[2:05:45] differences in the world today
[2:05:47] could you elbow your way through over
[2:05:50] the vulgarity and over the picture shows
[2:05:52] and the dancing and the carry-on that
[2:05:54] you do calling yourself a Christian to
[2:05:57] get to Jesus
[2:05:59] you say brother I don't I don't I don't
[2:06:01] I don't go dancing I don't go in there
[2:06:02] say okay that's fine could you lay down
[2:06:05] aside all your worldly social
[2:06:08] entertainment
[2:06:12] to come to the Lord Jesus to be
[2:06:14] entertained by him brother I don't
[2:06:16] struggle with social media I don't
[2:06:18] struggle with social I'm a Christian
[2:06:19] I've been a Christian a long time okay
[2:06:21] there's more
[2:06:23] she elbowed her right way through she
[2:06:25] was gonna get there regardless of how
[2:06:28] vile she was
[2:06:31] you are never ever too vile to go to the
[2:06:35] feet of Jesus
[2:06:38] and I'll tell you this too
[2:06:40] we're never too good that we don't need
[2:06:42] to be there as well
[2:06:45] I think sometimes that's a problem I
[2:06:47] think sometimes it's not that we think
[2:06:48] that we're too vile it's not that we
[2:06:50] think that we're too good to be there
[2:06:54] I know it was out of order
[2:06:57] here's another one here's another one
[2:06:58] that keeps us I know it was out of order
[2:07:01] he says God help us to get out of order
[2:07:05] every once in a while
[2:07:07] the trouble of it is this is his words
[2:07:10] now not my words the trouble of it is
[2:07:13] you got too much order
[2:07:16] now I can come into a church and I can
[2:07:17] preach this because I don't know what
[2:07:19] problems are in the church right
[2:07:21] yeah you could get mad at me but I don't
[2:07:23] know if we have too much order if we
[2:07:25] have too little every church has
[2:07:27] something right but if that's what it is
[2:07:29] he says the problem is you got too much
[2:07:31] order God help you to get out of order
[2:07:33] once in a while
[2:07:35] the troubled of is you got too much get
[2:07:37] out of order I hope the church gets out
[2:07:39] of order long enough to get saved
[2:07:44] oh that's good
[2:07:46] he says I remember when Jesus saved me
[2:07:49] he says I'll never forget it this little
[2:07:51] old Kentucky heart of mine was jumping
[2:07:53] 90 miles an hour he goes I wept I cried
[2:07:57] I shouted I didn't care who was standing
[2:08:00] around
[2:08:02] most of all I didn't care about this
[2:08:04] person
[2:08:05] who said don't do that
[2:08:07] that's the one that stops me I didn't
[2:08:09] care what this Pharisee what this bishop
[2:08:13] said
[2:08:14] I didn't care
[2:08:16] I wasn't paying attention to order I was
[2:08:19] in the presence of Jesus
[2:08:22] and she wasn't noticing how much order
[2:08:25] she was in or how much order she was out
[2:08:28] of the main thing was to get to Jesus
[2:08:32] to get to his feet and there he sat with
[2:08:35] dirty feet he sat without being kissed
[2:08:38] he wasn't welcome and she wanted to make
[2:08:42] him welcome
[2:08:45] she didn't care about the old
[2:08:47] pharisaical orders
[2:08:50] about the old traditions and nominations
[2:08:54] she pressed her way through to get to
[2:08:57] Jesus
[2:08:58] and God help us to have a Revival like
[2:09:02] that
[2:09:03] where men and women
[2:09:07] right I could put somebody else's face
[2:09:09] right there oh brother I know what
[2:09:11] church needs to hear that right oh I
[2:09:14] know what brother in the church or
[2:09:15] sister needs to hear that no right here
[2:09:16] where men and women will elbow their way
[2:09:21] through the crowds and the denominations
[2:09:23] and the barriers until they get to the
[2:09:26] presence of Jesus
[2:09:37] I don't know what to tell you
[2:09:43] do you want to do that kind of service
[2:09:45] for him
[2:09:49] or do you want to just continue just
[2:09:52] church on Sunday
[2:09:53] church on Wednesday
[2:09:56] sing three songs
[2:09:58] brother don't sing five songs that's too
[2:10:00] much
[2:10:02] right Don't Preach an hour and five
[2:10:05] minutes I've probably been an hour and
[2:10:06] five minutes
[2:10:07] don't pre that's too long brother
[2:10:10] or do we want to do a service for him
[2:10:15] oh brother I'll fellowship with you as
[2:10:17] long as you believe the message the way
[2:10:18] I believe it or do you want to do a
[2:10:20] service for him
[2:10:23] oh God thank you for where you've
[2:10:25] brought me from
[2:10:26] I'm so glad I'm not like that person
[2:10:28] over there
[2:10:30] or do you want to do a service for him
[2:10:33] do you want to take what where he's
[2:10:36] brought you and and this you want to
[2:10:38] take this box this box
[2:10:41] and break it
[2:10:43] and I don't care how young you are or
[2:10:46] how old you are this message applies
[2:10:50] that's the beautiful thing about the
[2:10:52] message it applies
[2:10:54] and and I could take this and say Lord
[2:10:57] have I broken my image to you today
[2:11:02] maybe I broke it yesterday maybe I broke
[2:11:04] it last week but have I taken who I am
[2:11:08] and said Lord I'm nothing
[2:11:11] I'm nothing
[2:11:16] this is bower heads
[2:11:18] the heavenly father Lord you you know
[2:11:20] father maybe that these are just broken
[2:11:23] words Lord are mixed up words Lord but I
[2:11:25] pray that they're from you Lord that
[2:11:27] Lord you would take something
[2:11:30] Lord from your word from your Bible Lord
[2:11:33] and you would reveal it to the heart
[2:11:35] this morning Lord
[2:11:36] of somebody
[2:11:38] somebody who wants to do a service for
[2:11:41] you
[2:11:42] Lord somebody to who maybe your feet has
[2:11:46] been a strange place
[2:11:48] but they want to get to know it again
[2:11:50] Lord
[2:11:53] Lord maybe your presence is something
[2:11:55] that they've enjoyed but really haven't
[2:11:58] entered into lately Lord
[2:12:04] that maybe they
[2:12:07] Lord me
[2:12:09] holding back forgiveness for somebody
[2:12:14] Lord I want to enter into your presence
[2:12:16] Lord I want to do a service for you Lord
[2:12:18] and Lord maybe that service for you Lord
[2:12:21] is for me to forgive that person Lord
[2:12:23] Lord maybe they've done me wrong
[2:12:25] absolutely wrong Lord
[2:12:28] but lord I can't do his service for you
[2:12:30] Lord as long as that's in the way
[2:12:34] Lord I don't know who this message was
[2:12:36] two or four Lord but I know it applies
[2:12:38] to me father Lord I've built up a an
[2:12:42] image
[2:12:43] Lord a beautiful statue a beautiful box
[2:12:46] container Lord that's just Lord it means
[2:12:49] nothing without you
[2:12:51] Lord it has no value in it Lord I want
[2:12:54] that full surrender that lies inside of
[2:12:57] that box Lord
[2:12:59] I don't want to serve you out of Duty
[2:13:01] Lord I don't want to serve you because
[2:13:02] the message says to Lord I want to serve
[2:13:04] you because I love you
[2:13:06] Lord enough I love you Lord just show me
[2:13:09] show me as you have today Lord what it
[2:13:11] is I need to do
[2:13:13] Lord neither do I want to do a service
[2:13:15] for you without it being your will Lord
[2:13:17] I don't want to do what I want to do
[2:13:19] father
[2:13:20] I want to do what you want me to do
[2:13:25] Lord You're so gracious to us Lord
[2:13:27] You're so
[2:13:29] words can't describe Lord that you would
[2:13:32] be so merciful as to Time After Time
[2:13:36] show us in the word Lord where we've
[2:13:38] gone wrong Lord and not only where we've
[2:13:40] gone wrong Lord but show us that you've
[2:13:42] made a way out of that wrong Lord
[2:13:47] now Lord maybe I've maybe I've not
[2:13:49] handled something right maybe I've not
[2:13:50] thought about a person a Believer a
[2:13:52] brother a sister just right but Lord
[2:13:54] you've made a way out of that
[2:13:57] you've made a way for me to go and make
[2:13:59] that right
[2:14:01] Lord if it's something if it's a
[2:14:03] personal weakness Lord that I'm holding
[2:14:05] on to or somebody in here Lord just
[2:14:07] can't overcome Lord You've Made A Way
[2:14:12] and Lord that way is to do a service for
[2:14:14] you
[2:14:22] well I know these are just these are
[2:14:25] just words Lord but your word
[2:14:27] is all-powerful
[2:14:29] your word Lord is the truth
[2:14:33] Lord if there's a heart
[2:14:37] Lord if there's a heart that's just
[2:14:39] tired Lord
[2:14:40] of maintaining a Christian image Lord
[2:14:45] and wants more of you Lord that wants to
[2:14:47] pour it all out today Lord
[2:14:51] Lord would you just
[2:14:53] [Music]
[2:14:55] would you just recognize that Heart Lord
[2:14:57] by maybe a hand that would go up Lord
[2:15:00] our eyes are closed our heads are bowed
[2:15:02] Lord with somebody
[2:15:04] father say Lord I am tired
[2:15:08] of maintaining this image as a Christian
[2:15:12] Lord I need more of you
[2:15:15] and Lord if we've held in
[2:15:18] our worship Lord if we've held in our
[2:15:20] forgiveness Lord if we've held in what
[2:15:22] you've done for us would you just help
[2:15:25] us to pour that all out Lord
[2:15:28] and Lord I Believe by Your Word Lord you
[2:15:31] promised
[2:15:33] to be there in that moment
[2:15:37] Lord you would say I'll make you new
[2:15:39] again I'll form you the way I want you
[2:15:42] to be this morning
[2:15:43] and fill us Lord
[2:15:50] Lord we're not trying to work up any
[2:15:52] emotion father
[2:15:53] but lord it's genuine confession Lord
[2:15:56] one to another
[2:15:58] of Lord I need to be
[2:16:00] closer to you
[2:16:02] Lord I've had you Lord but I want more
[2:16:04] of you Lord
[2:16:12] I pray you would just do something new
[2:16:14] for
[2:16:15] those this morning that are just humble
[2:16:17] Lord Lord that are coming to you maybe
[2:16:20] we didn't come this morning with that
[2:16:21] attitude but if now Lord
[2:16:23] if you would just break us down lord
[2:16:26] I pray you would come to that heart this
[2:16:29] morning
[2:16:30] Lord and begin to mend them
[2:16:32] maybe a healing that they've been
[2:16:34] desperately praying for Lord and
[2:16:36] believing in Lord that you would say
[2:16:38] here's your healing you've done a
[2:16:40] service for me
[2:16:43] if it's a closer walk with you Lord
[2:16:46] would you give that to him this morning
[2:16:47] if it's Deliverance Lord would you give
[2:16:50] that to them this morning

[2:17:52] this box of this life this human being
[2:17:55] is nothing Lord
[2:17:58] take the inside of me and I pray that
[2:18:01] every box that's here today would be
[2:18:03] filled with that oil of the Holy Spirit
[2:18:06] take that box of me
[2:18:09] as our brother said will you press
[2:18:12] through the crowds
[2:18:15] to get to the son of God
[2:18:19] if you're willing to press through those
[2:18:21] crowds one way to press through the
[2:18:24] crowd is to be baptized in the name of
[2:18:26] Jesus Christ to show everyone I am not
[2:18:29] too good for anyone Lord I want to be
[2:18:31] baptized and I want everyone here to see
[2:18:34] that I will give my heart to you and my
[2:18:37] life will change this box is broken
[2:18:42] if you have a desire to be baptized in
[2:18:44] the name of Jesus Christ
[2:18:46] go back and see brother sister Elizabeth
[2:18:48] and brother Ed
[2:18:50] if you can meet the those that would
[2:18:52] like to be baptized brother Ed if you
[2:18:54] could bring them all the way up my
[2:18:56] brother and help me up there
[2:19:02] and if there would be more
[2:19:05] and if you have been baptized that box
[2:19:08] needs to be broken every day
[2:19:13] and you watch when you break that box
[2:19:16] you watch that oil
[2:19:18] come out
[2:19:20] because it's brother Dan it's not about
[2:19:22] us
[2:19:24] it is not about this guy right here it
[2:19:27] is about the Lord Jesus Christ and what
[2:19:30] can I do for him
[2:19:32] and the only way I can serve him is if I
[2:19:35] serve his people
[2:19:37] he's God he doesn't need me
[2:19:40] he's a sovereign God but but by the
[2:19:44] grace of God he can use us
[2:19:48] for his glory
[2:19:52] if you have a desire to be baptized
[2:19:54] go back
[2:19:56] to the back brother Jonathan if you
[2:19:59] could lead us
[2:20:00] and a few songs of worship
[2:20:04] let me read Romans chapter 6 it says
[2:20:07] this
[2:20:08] verse 1
[2:20:10] brother Jeremy if you could put it up
[2:20:15] moving into the baptismal service it
[2:20:17] says what shall we say then
[2:20:21] shall we continue in sin that Grace May
[2:20:24] abound God forbid
[2:20:28] how shall we
[2:20:30] that are dead to sin live any longer
[2:20:32] therein know ye not that so many of us
[2:20:35] as we're baptized into Jesus Christ were
[2:20:38] baptized into his death
[2:20:41] therefore we are buried with him by
[2:20:44] baptism into death that like as Christ
[2:20:47] was raised up from the dead by the glory
[2:20:50] of the father even though even so we
[2:20:53] also
[2:20:55] should walk
[2:20:56] in the newness of life
[2:21:00] that's what baptism represents brothers
[2:21:02] and sisters that this sinful man this
[2:21:07] Alabaster Box is broken
[2:21:10] and the oil of the holy spirit is going
[2:21:13] to come out God bless you
