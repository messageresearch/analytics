[Music] [Music] [Music] good afternoon to the family lopez family sotelo family all of you represented here in the the service memorial service for brother frank here with family with friends and sometimes we never think we would see a day like this but the day comes for each one of us so our hearts must be ready so before we get started let me just go over a couple of things due to the the covid issue and we're going to ask that you be as careful as possible in everything you do and once the service is over we want to exit the church and go outside as quickly as possible and not spend a lot of time inside the house uh of the church of god here uh we've seen it happen for a few families and and people have come down ill with that so let's not do that and um please honor that we don't do it you know in any way to restrict you but just just for safety so if we'll stand and let's open this service in prayer just as we start lord as we start this this afternoon in memory of of one who loved you and you loved our brother frank lopez and his family and friends here talk about the good things the grace of god in the mercy of god lord share our experiences share our hearts lord may you be pleased and honored in all things lord may your comfort cover and take care of each one we ask in jesus name amen you may be seated as we we thought about this and and heard he had passed away a couple days before he passed away the lopez family got a hold of me and asked if me and my dad could go visit them at the house on wednesday and it brought back a lot of memories used to go to the house there brother frank would tell me and my brother be here at six o'clock in the morning so we can get started work bright and early and after a couple of weeks i realized i didn't have to get there till about seven but we came at six anyways and brother frank would say i gotta go wake up frankie and johnny and he said if you don't mind go ahead and load the tools on the truck and get the trailer hooked up and so if it was good we got about 7 30. that became the work day of the week and then it was go go go go go i was 16 years old when we first came and they were he was my first employer brother frank and one of the last things that we did together him and his son frankie came and they put a new roof on our house he went up the ladder carried all the tools right up had no problems with it and i said lord i hope when i get that age i can still do that too but you know he was a child of god first and above all i saw him be a man i saw him be tried by his two boys pretty hard they would stay far enough away from dad where he couldn't reach them and they would stand there holding the broom not wanting to move too much but that's okay he loved him anyways johnny reminded me of a time that brother frank was chasing one of them with the broom and somebody stopped and he saw it and he and he rolled down the window and he said to them him he says you know that's child abuse and frank picked up the room he said if you don't get going you're going to get it next so the man drove away but you know i'm glad that god had mercy on us when i didn't behave he might have tweaked my ears some but his love and his mercy and he loved his children he loved his family and you know it's it's the grace of god if you'll stand let's sing that song amazing grace how sweet this sound when somebody tells you when you've done wrong and you failed and they say i forgive you and they mean it with all their heart that is grace undeserving but they forgive you anyways [Music] like me i once was lost but now i am found i was blind but now i see [Music] twas grace my heart to fear and embrace my fears how precious did that grace [Music] i have already grace that brought me safe and grace will be me now here's hope for every one of us here when we've been there ten thousand [Music] the sun we know to sing god's grace and when we first you may be seated i just want to share a couple of scriptures and then after that the eulogy by frank lopez the third here so psalms 116. we'll read a few scriptures out of there the word of god is true it is faithful and it accomplishes what it says so starting with verse i love the lord because he has heard my voice and my supplications because he has inclined his ear unto me wherefore i will call upon him as long as i live and as i thought about brother frank and knowing the family and all for some time you guys would have a different view than i would have because you were with him all the time saw him all the time but as i was thinking about some scriptures this came to my mind because he has inclined his ear unto me therefore will i call upon him as long as i live the sorrows of death compassed me and the pains of hell get upon me and i found trouble and sorrow and as a human you have those times in life those times and but god has a promise then i called upon the name of the lord i said oh lord i beseech thee deliver my soul gracious is lord and righteous yea our god is merciful and i like this translation the lord is full of grace and righteousness truly he is a god of mercy return unto thy rest o my soul for the lord hath dealt bountiful with thee or come back to your rest o my soul for the lord has given you your reward for thou has delivered my soul from death mine eyes from tears and my feet from falling you have taken my soul from the power of death keeping my eyes from weeping and my free feet from failing if you could see dad right now and husband and uncle and a dear brother the young man that he would be about 21 years old he would tell you it's worth every bit of it amen there's no question about that what shall i render unto the lord for all his benefits towards me what may i give to the lord for all the good things which he has done for me if if brother frank could recount some of those they would far outweigh the sorrows and the hard times it's worth it all i will take the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the lord i will pay my vows unto the lord now in the presence of his people and today we would talk of his memory but i think if he would say one thing to all of you it's been worth serving god my life giving him my life as a young man and then this was a scripture that it spoke to me precious in the sight of the lord is the death of his saints as they come back home to be with him my dad met brother frank he told me in 1952. dad was about 16 and brother frank would have been about 20 21 years old back in california and the pentecostal church both young christians and and and he grew up that way part of the the when brother branham preached behind this pulpit in 1960 sitting on that side of the church there was the sotelo family the lopez family the duron family who was the other the figaro family it was all part of that group there and and brother branham told brother stromey who was a good friend of his that while he was ministering the angel of the lord stood there and pointed to that group and said now this message is for them folks they will receive the grace of god we might have not understood and people may have not understood but god had you and his family in mind and he's never forsaken you he's never left you and in the time of of remembrance and the time of when things get hard and where's grandpa where's dad where's where's my husband remember god has it in his control and soon and very soon as a whole family will get to be together again so now is if um frankie jr or frankie iii would come up and do the eulogy and then followed by uh healing prayer from benjamin lopez's grandson thank you good morning and thank you for joining us today um my name is frank lopez iii and would like to say it is an honor to be up here to share to me and glimpse of an amazing person's story i would like to say everyone looks amazing so we are here to remember and celebrate the life of frank flores lopez senior an irreplaceable person that had a huge impact on so many people's lives so last week i've been thinking how do i sum up the life of someone who i thought so highly of and held in such high regard and let me tell you when you work for the post office you have a lot of time by yourself to think and i came to the conclusion i can stand up here for hours and just keep talking so i figure i just um show you what i came down to in the bible the book of genesis on the sixth day when god created a man verse 28 says god blessed them and said to them be fruitful and multiply a number fill the earth and subdue it rule over the fish and the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on this ground my nana and thought that did an amazing job at this by having 24 grandkids and 47 great-grandkids how beautiful is that even though the grieving process is different for everyone and affects everyone differently i would like to say it's okay to cry it's okay to be sad upset or even a little angry but if you knew my thought that you would know that he had us to the kingdom of heaven a long time ago right and that this life was only temporary he would always say that his flesh was of this world but his soul would be in the kingdom of heaven with god but to the lopez family remember the same blood that goes through your veins is the same that went through our arthathos to some he was known as brother frank to some it was theo frank to my brothers sisters cousins nephews and nieces he was known as thothem and to select few they had been blessed with calling him dad regardless of what you may have called him or known him by you pretty much got the same true person every time he lived a long and humble and beautiful life so bear with me as i stand from up here to look out it's truly beautiful to see how many people's whose lives was touched in some way by him where there was that church praising god or he was helping him landscape a soon to be a beautiful yard or even learning to ride a bike drive a car motorcycle you would hear his sturdy soft and understanding voice which never could be replaced on the morning of november 14th frank flores lopez senior was called to join god in heaven my thought that was born on august 12th 1931 to thomas and josephine in riverside california he came from a very big family and from a young age he learned the meaning of hard work i'm always talking about picking cotton and fruits off trees as a kid and even working at a movie theater running film and driving the owner's nice cars to resupply the snacks he married my nana aggie and had five beautiful kids once moving to tucson he would embark on a landscaping career which he was very proud of he was an extremely hard worker great provider a family man and a great role model he taught us the meaning of hard work we'll always remember spending the summers and most weekends over at his house going to work countless hours doing landscaping at houses throughout the day and even watching you make boxes in the living room out of cardboard duct tape and nylons which i would say was very impressive to say the least it definitely gave us an appreciation for for him and how hard he worked to provide for his family and i'm glad we could be part of that he showed us the importance or important family is to love one another and always be there for each other no matter what most importantly he brought god into our lives and i can still remember sitting in his room as well as my cousins and brothers reading the bible and listening to cassette tapes and telling us what each pass has meant and will cherish those times forever words can't express how much he will be missed and i'm so thankful that the lord blessed my family with his presence for nearly 90 years he truly will be missed and my prayers are with everyone's whose lives he's touched he truly was the best thought in the world and my family knows he's already in heaven watching over us there is like some kind of comfort in this not only knowing that he's with god jesus christ but knowing he will be joining his baby girl esther his dad tomas josephine and his brother joe and jesse and his sisters eleanor and ramona in heaven and i know the bar of life has been set very high by my tata and i think with the help of god love hard work and dedication we too can continue his legacy and make sure his name will never be forgotten amen i just want to say thank you for everyone that's came out here and it's definitely it's nice seeing everyone here and we love you guys a lot that's all i have thank you if he'll please stand and have the prayer spoken by benjamin lopez a healing prayer healing is of god alone god alone has purchased for us our healing it's up to us to do everything we can in our life and in every way that god has given us for our healing but god but it's god that heals if god calls you to go home tonight there isn't enough medicine in the world that will keep you here and if he determines you're to stay on earth no matter how many physicians say you're going tonight you're not going so it's all up to god thank everybody for coming and we love you all thank you yes it's not an easy thing to stand here and speak of your your family but the hope and the insurance that we have our sister and iran has a song peace in the valley if you you may be seated if she would prepare do then i was thinking of not getting to know the sotelo families the two youngest boys tim and sam went to high school together and i remember sitting there at the in the cafeteria and you had to guard your food with your fork if tim was close by because he'd reach over and take it but they're good memories part of that thank you [Music] well i'm tired and [Music] calls me away [Music] [Music] in the valley for me someday there will be peace [Music] trouble i see there will be and the skies will be clear [Music] is and no clowns there will [Music] will be never in the valley for me [Music] there will be peace [Music] no trouble [Music] for me [Music] shall lay down [Music] shall be lit [Music] there will be peace in the valley for me someday there will be [Music] [Music] me [Music] what a hope we have and it's more than a hope because you can experience that peace even now so now brother caleb jerome pastor of the amazing grace tabernacle will be speaking if we'll stand as he prepares to come and then follow with that sister lily if he will take the piano and where the caleb elite is on the sir the song wings of a dove so god bless you better amen god bless you and good afternoon would you do me a favor turn around and tell somebody don't shake hands just turn around tell somebody it's good to see you god bless you glad you're here would you do that wonderful sister lily would you come actually now and so we can sing a little bit if you don't mind you all are so quiet and i'm not used to quiet i know you're sad and i know you're feeling you know funny and how do you uh how are we supposed to take this people are telling you it's gonna be okay um don't worry about it uh let me just tell you cry all you want to let it hurt all you want to but hold on to the assurance you're going to see him again can we say amen so i'm used to a man's too right can we all say amen didn't that feel better i think we get masks on our face and we think we can't talk in church anymore right but it was good remember that you're here to honor the memory of somebody that you loved but this individual that she loved wasn't somebody who went to church part-time or went to church as a pastime this is what he gave his life to so we can all say amen let's sing on the wings of the snow white dove that'd be okay just we'll sing the chorus for now and then we'll do the verses later okay would you all help me sing it okay so two of you are going to help me sing it [Music] are you all going to help me sing it all right on the wings of snow [Music] on the wings of a dove and again on the wings of a dove oh on the wings of us god [Music] now see i sang i'ma let you sing it one time [Music] oh you sound good [Music] [Music] you know why he's here because you can that's what he does when you when you call on him and we invite his presence then god shows up amen let's read a scripture if you would just for a few moments thank you would you stay nearby wray thank you uh let's go to the book of chapter of luke chapter 9 and we'll read it and i promise not to keep you too long chapter 9 verse 23 i want to thank the lopez family for asking me to do this it's a real honor and i really appreciate it amen and also want to extend my gratitude to the pastor and the assistant pastor here may god bless them may god bless you all it's always good to be back together uh one time i i did a funeral for uh some folks at the church and then a little bit a couple weeks later had to do another one same family and then a few weeks after that did another one and so i didn't know how to handle the third one so i got up and i just said before i get started i wanted to let you know i also do weddings right all right brother green says we always want to all get together but nobody wants to die right but it's an opportunity to get together and to mend old wounds and to get over things and remember that most of our disagree disagreements are petty and nothing's worth nothing's not nothing is worth losing a relationship with one another is that all right to say amen all right luke chapter nine if you would and verse 23 we'll read it together 23 uh brother in the back there through 27 and he said to them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it for what is a man advantage if he gain the whole world and lose himself or be cast away for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words now i want you to hang on to that word ashamed okay for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and my words of him shall the son of man be ashamed when he shall come in his own glory and in his fathers and of the holy angels but i tell you of a truth there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of god how many can believe that may god had a blessing to the reading of his word let's pray for a moment father lord if it wasn't for you i wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for your presence or for your invitation none of us would be standing here there would be no celebration of life there would be no good memories to have we would simply be a heathen people a gentile people that knew no god but because of your grace and mercy you sent down your son jesus christ who died for us that we gentiles may know the glory of almighty god and so father we thank you for the opportunity to be together together here to know who you are and to remind each other of these great truths like the young brothers both got up and said we know where he is so i will only i can only assume that they all know that he is coming back again in the name of the lord jesus christ i pray father that you would comfort each heart would you be with each one that's hurting in each one that that has a tear to shed will you do as you have said that you would bless those that mourn for they shall be comforted this is the hour of comfort this is when we need that part of you lord but i pray father this will not be the only part of you that we continue to need for we still need a savior can you say amen we'll still need a deliverer can you say amen we still need a healer can you say amen and father we still need you in every facet of our life we're still looking towards you thank you we pray in jesus christ's name for there is none greater amen god bless you may be seated kind of a strange uh uh scripture here that to read at a funeral you normally people want to take the thought of uh you know i am the resurrection and the life how many have ever heard that one right we've gone to funerals and and we talk about how he raised lazarus from the dead and so forth but i think we should understand that brother frank was raised from the dead a long time ago does anybody understand that i'll help you see when he gave his life to jesus christ he died his old the old frank passed away at that moment we see we're here grieving a a death of the flesh but long ago when he was born again he gave up himself at that time when he accepted the lord jesus christ as his savior when he decided to to uh to be baptized in christian baptism it was at that time that the old frank died how many understand that we say amen so then we understand that in the resurrection we don't have to worry about whether or not he'll come back because we know that he'll raise up with christ in the resurrection you know there are different religions that that believe and give us the opportunity that if we want to we can go and get baptized for those that have died already how many understands that and the idea behind it is just in case they didn't make it i'll go and get baptized so that they that way they can have a chance well i think the theory is sound but it just doesn't work that way how many understands we need to make sure that our calling in election is is is on point it's made positive at this hour well i don't want to get to a death bed and figure out that my whole entire life has been a liar where my whole entire life has been frivolous or based on monetary gain because the bible clearly said here jesus said what does the man profit if he gains the whole world but he loses his soul as i went to talk to the family the other night i heard different things and i i like to hear the stories of the old timers because let's be honest brother charlie they don't make them like that anymore now do they can anybody say amen you see brother uh i saw johnny johnny lopez where you okay right there you are in hiding behind a mask i was talking about how his how brother frank had just quit working two years ago i was like how old was he when he passed away 89. two years ago he was working he told me about how he was up on a plank and two palm trees at 70 years old and he's using that belt and when he got up there he said when he got down he said my knee is starting to hurt and then he pulled the belt and it snapped and he goes well i guess that's my sign i'm going to stop working now no more climbing trees but i said you know brother johnny they just don't make them like that anymore their generation is strong but not as strong our generation is strong but not as strong and not as strong and then as they keep on going we we get weaker and weaker but the idea behind it is it's because we need to learn how to depend on jesus christ our lord and savior who needs to be our strength and our ever-present help at any time can you say amen brother frank was an individual who believed in jesus christ and when i sat there and heard the different stories i thought it was nice to hear what his wife had to tell him she said brother he read his bible every single day how many knew that she said but i told him one time you can't just read it frankie you need to live it yeah she said that don't get mad and i i had to come back around to that you remember sister rachel turn around i go hey hang on a second who told him that she said i told him brother she goes i don't know if he got offended but it didn't matter i said thank god for a good wife because it's true you can't just read it you need to apply it all the stories that they told that he was gather the children around and they would up he would play tapes i remember i grew up in such atmosphere but even playing tapes it's not where it stops if you take the words and leave the words on well who listens to tapes anymore right it's mp3s or or ipods or or even on your phone but if you just leave the words of the prophet on that mechanism or if you just leave the words of jesus on the pages it does us no good we have got to find out that we're not ashamed of the gospel is anybody in here ashamed somebody put up their hands i'm ashamed of the lord nobody will do it right no one will do it because you don't want to be identified as such but yet in our daily walk and i'm not here to scold you i'm here to encourage you because i would like to see every one of you make it to heaven how many would like to go to heaven let's see your hands go up now you know the prophet of god said one time i want all my family to make it he said i even want my friends to go now here's the catch he said i even want my enemies to go now you don't have to put up your hand but if you want to be honest how many of you got trouble with the last one i'm the only one really i said don't put up your hands then okay let's be honest how many has got trouble with that one thank you one or two people see but how can we be ashamed of the gospel well i'm a christian do you do you act like one so we we find out a lot of times when we come to churches especially in message congregations it's always about how you dress and how you look well let me just tell you i don't think that's right at all if you'll get the holy ghost he'll settle how you dress and how you look and how you behave i thought it was interesting that brother johnny told me he said when he would or maybe his sister rachel or becky that sister becky there was telling me all these different stories and they said if you were dating somebody he'd come in he said if you can't fit a large bible between you then you're sitting too close what was he doing he was taking sides with jesus he's trying to make sure that we didn't have any problems you understand johnny told me brother johnny he told me he said well we would go out you know until he'd go like this one thirty two o'clock three o'clock in the morning and i was looking at him i said what time johnny he said you know two three thirty nine what were you doing out there so that doesn't matter you know he said but my dad would stay awake praying reading his bible and listening to a tape until we got home now i thought i wonder what happened after they got home don't want to talk about that now huh let's talk about good things but that was a good thing see what was it taking sides with jesus standing in a gap or being in a position to where if my children are not quite to the place where i am i'll stay awake like job did job would make sacrifices and he would make sure that just in case watch read the bible now he said just in case my children have sinned just in case they've made a mistake here's a sacrifice so that god would cover their sin come on somebody right so then you have a modern day job in your family and he was staying awake just in case johnny's out doing just in case becky's out i'll tell you what i'll stay awake and i'll pray and i'll listen to a tape until they get home so that god will protect them and bring them home does anybody understand what i'm saying now it's time to take ties with jesus to stop being ashamed of your lineage who you are you were raised by frank lopez and his wife to not just be a a listener of the word but to be a doer and a partaker of such to not just have a guarantee that we know tata is in heaven and that's fine but do we know that we're going to be in heaven well you all got quiet on me now don't get hurt you see that's what the whole point of a funeral is isn't it to make your calling in election sure to find out that you know what when i when i get there am i going to have any trouble at the gate i know my grandmother is there i know a lot of people that have gone on but i just want to be there when he comes is that all right to say how many is mad at me you can raise your hand go ahead be honest you don't want to be honest all right we're trying to find out if i may share this with you being ashamed means to feel shamed or embarrassed or or disgraced i mean who would ever have the nerve brother larry who would ever have the nerve to turn around and say i don't want to be disgraced by jesus christ could you imagine how how many would ever send him say i'm ashamed of the lord jesus well i'll show you his disciples did it when they were crucifying them it was a disgraceful act one of the most shameful things that that a person could be put through and they wanted nothing to do with it but i wonder i wonder i just wonder are his disciples acting the same way even today i'm not ashamed of the gospel are you i need some answers hello we're not ashamed of jesus christ amen we identify with jesus if it wasn't for jesus where would any of us be what kind of a lifestyle would we have what kind of a a childhood would we have been raised by if it had not been for jesus so then our brother frank took it a step further i got this story and i thought it was fun his apostolic pastor brother larry you may remember these things took him to uh hear a man named william branham that's how he said it he said but we're just going because they say that that that he can heal people and he prays and people come to life let's just go see what he can do see what he can do but don't listen too much to what he says or pay the words were watch everything he says and so your grandfather your uncle your tata did exactly that he took his bible and he opened it up and he said every time brother brennan said something he looked for it because he was going to get him is that what he said he said i'm going to get him i'm going to find out where he's wrong i'm going to tell this guy and then something strange happened he couldn't find where brother branham was wrong isn't that odd who they get back and then after that brother branham started calling people out your name is so-and-so your name is so-and-so you're from here you live over there you're here for this and and frank brother frank lopez saw god updated have you anybody ever heard that before updated out of the pages of history and he could see the reality of what god was it wasn't a man it was god in a man can somebody say amen and then what took place with this they go back home and the apostolic pastor says now the the healing was fine and all that but just disregard everything he said well your grandfather stood up for him and said well i looked i couldn't find where he was wrong and after about 30 minutes of of tussle he says uh frank you can turn in your keys he said here they are and that's what started this whole revolution of message believing with your family he saw god on display and realized that jesus christ of the uh jehovah god of the old testament was indeed jesus christ of the new testament how many understand that say amen he also realized that he was jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever and then brought his family out so that you all could learn and know the same thing amen i asked you did you still want me to preach this is because i love you because i came from a similar heritage my grandfather and your father is that right brother charlie brother manuel sotelo went up now what this is not about a man so just listen carefully okay don't get upset yet give it a chance and then you can decide what you want to believe but they went up to where the den was being built and they uh ran into a man named bankswood brother bankswood and they were there kind of just being nosy that's what i understood and he comes out and he says i've been waiting for you two brothers and they said no we don't work here they were dressed in work clothes and so forth they said we're just kind of snooping around he said you don't understand he said you see i asked brother branham when i was to come back home and he said you're going to wait there there's going to be two hispanic brothers driving a green van wearing white overalls that are gonna go to the den to ask questions about this message and when you answer their questions you can come home so you see i've been waiting for you well that settled it for my grandfather and for the sotelo grandfather so what does where does that put us not to just directly believe in a man but believe in the god that was in that man and believe in the god that was in your grandfather's that had enough holy spirit to knew to know when it was time to get out and follow the pillar of fire how many understands so then where does it leave us it puts us in a position as this is that we would have enough of the holy ghost to realize that we're not trying to hold on to buildings or hold on to memories or hold on to people we're trying to hold on to jesus christ who is the same yesterday and today and forever if you can sort of believe it just say amen where are you at today are you ashamed of the gospel would you tell anybody what your grandfather really believed would you be able to say my grandfather followed jesus christ and saul prophet live et cetera or do we bury that and say well we don't want to talk about that people won't understand we don't need them to listen to understand we need them to see a life lived what this generation and what this world is dying to see is jesus and somebody else where the young people are tired of hearing the stories they're tired of listening to tapes they want to see it happen in their day is god still alive yes or no is he still able to heal yes or no can he still save yes or no yes i know that he took people away with covet but he's also able to protect you from covet how many knows that's true that young brother was up here last i think or the healing prayer who did that that was you brother you're right it doesn't matter how many physicians will tell you you're going to die if god's not done with you you ain't going nowhere yes but if it's your time to go you're going to go but here's how it works just be ready to go when he comes for you when he hears you when he calls you are you going to hear his name if you let me just wrap it up with this you y'all seem kind of angry are you okay you know what it is it's the mask i can't tell if you're smiling or saying that or nothing you know what's strange about mass i realize you can see mischief a whole lot better it's just the truth you look in somebody's eyes you're like you're not a nice person right could you imagine brother aaron with a marriage you're smarter you'd never think he was a bad guy would you how could somebody be ashamed of jesus well i'll simply tell you like this if you're not born again it's very easy to be ashamed of god because that's your flesh you understand but when you're born again of the spirit of god and you're baptized and you accept the lord your savior and you're baptized in the in the name of the lord jesus christ and you receive the holy ghost well that means that god's life is inside of you as it was inside of brother frank here and i just want to ask you then how can god be ashamed of god if the life of god is in you how can the life of god be ashamed of god you understand what i mean there's no reproach at that point there's no well i'm embarrassed i know i'm proud that my grandfather was frank lopez i'm proud that my grandfather was joe duran senior i'm glad i'm proud that my grandfather was emanuel hotel and on and on we go what is it it's because they believe the true report and i'm going to believe the same is that right if you'll turn with me just quickly now first john chapter 2 and then we'll stop being abusive first john chapter 2 verse 15. love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passes away and the lusts thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth forever now brother caleb what does this mean and what are you trying to get at because we're here to talk about my grandfather well i am talking about your grandfather for the entire time he didn't look at the world how many of you oh i saw where he lived but how many of you understand your grandfather wasn't into material stuff was he let me see your hands go up you believe that your dad your father whoever he wasn't into that stuff but he made sure our brother johnny said but he always made sure we had things he made sure we had shoes he goes he goes you know we didn't have the best shoes he said but all our neighbors always came over to our house for food they knew where to find the grub right because those things were not important to him what was important was will my children see jesus well my grandchildren see the lord and i know that he prayed for all of you i know he did or else you wouldn't be sitting here honoring his memory how can you best honor somebody when they go to just have a funeral service memorial service to say some nice things and and talk about dear old dad every now and then or is it better to live what they taught you at least one person say you know from now on i'm gonna do the right thing i'm not ashamed of jesus and i'm not afraid i'm not ashamed of what my grandfather lived not ashamed of what my father lived what he lived was right he lived to be a nice ripe old age and i could just imagine the reunion it must have been him walking in and seeing all those that had walked on before because he believed the true report in this day and age was talking to brother matt in the back there and he said the hypocrisy this whole covert thing stands six feet apart but but then you're all uh uh smothered into a what they call a plane anyway a cylinder or whatever and he goes you're breathing the same air they approved it and i said of course but see so you don't know who to believe somebody faked the election somebody stole it somebody this somebody that who do you believe everything is swayed by opinion covert will kill you covet won't this will kill you that won't take this don't take this wear a mask don't wear a mask anybody confused yet this building is big enough you all probably don't have to wear them but you're doing it anyhow and it's okay standing right in front of them the truth of the matter is outside of jesus none of us in here stand a chance not you not me not anybody i'll tell you this in the name of the lord look to jesus christ and live is that all right now did you all appreciate your grandfather your father would you give the lord a hand of a praise for your grandfather's life would you do it [Applause] handsome looking guy wasn't he i didn't recognize him when i saw when i saw went to pray for him the other day i don't even know if he ever knew i was there brother john need to pray for him it don't matter god knows all things he's going to keep you would you allow me to pray for you bow your heads for a moment if you would [Music] i know that some things that may have been said may be a little hard you'll wonder who is this guy does he even love us let me tell you with all sincerity i live i love each and every one of you though i don't know you you have a powerful lineage a powerful heritage but you can't get in on somebody else's prayer alone you need to make your own way so with everybody's everyone's head bowed without anybody looking around if you don't mind if you say just raise up your hand said brother caleb pray for me that i'll find my way there's one two three four look at this now it's not the time to be ashamed not while he's here and i wonder if brother frank is looking over the banister of time now and he's proud of this movement i wonder if he's looking at some of you saying hey come on get your hand up now don't don't miss this does anybody else want to raise their hand say brother caleb remember me god bless you god bless you brother father you see the hands that went up all over the room that's not like credit for me or i did something that's you tugging on their hearts oh how i remember the first time you tugged on mine i ain't never been the same since wrong right mistakes no mistakes backslidden slide forward step one step forward five steps back it don't matter we're all the same people we're all just trying to get there but how i'll never forget the first time you pulled on my heart father i pray this afternoon that if you're pulling on as you're pulling on the people's hearts today that they don't forget that this day on december the 12th of 2020 god tugged in my heart and i never looked back bless the honest hearts the honest hands that went up father for your honor and your glory i commit them to you the lord that you might be praised further in spirit and in truth knowing that everything that's ever happened since the beginning of time has been so you could gather us together and how we're closing getting to the end any minute now it's over with watch over us lord we pray we thank you for this time in jesus christ's name amen may god bless you would you stand with me as we sing the song together and i'll turn the service back over amen we'll start with the verse brother noah had drifted on the flood many days he searched for land in various ways troubles he

shedding his blood for you you're redeemed back as a child and the son of god amen so just a couple more memories i'd like to share with you going back to first meeting brother frank and the family and getting to know the boys as they grew up and rachel was quite young there but becky and my wife were good friends and esther was their older sister that had passed away was alive but we'd go out and sister aggie and sometimes becky and rachel would be going ahead and watering all the plants to make sure that we didn't have to stop and could go from house to house and get it done and i thought that was different i never saw that before and i used to wonder how did brother frank get them to do that but you know when when a husband and wife and a family love one another and they get along they're willing to share it it was different to me you know i always enjoyed it a couple years that we got to spend together working with him and treated us fair and treated us right and one of the ones that stood out to me was we were doing a cleanup job and this man came up and he he asked brother frank if brother frank would consider doing the job because it was right there in the neighborhood so brother frank gave him a quote and the man said that's a lot of money and brother frank goes it's a lot of work and the man just walked away and said okay because i'd worked for another man and somebody would tell him that then he would cut the price down was all said and done the man would charge 25 dollars and me and the labor would say well that's five dollars for me and five dollars for you for a full day of work but brother frank charged and then he said let's go to work so learn that life you'll learn that young if we'll stand as a congregational song when we all get to heaven what a day of rejoicing that'll be you know some of the grandchildren don't remember grandpa's a young man about 19 to 21 years old in fact you boys and daughters don't remember dad that much either but we'll all be around the same age there won't be no old people in heaven stooped over and be young people and what a day that'll be amen he'll prepare for us a place when we all get to have what a day of rejoicing that will be when we all see jesus we will sing and shout the victory and while we want them clouds will overspread the sky but when traveling days are over not a shadow not a sun when we all get to have what a day of rejoicing that will be when we all see jesus we'll sing and shout the victory oh let [Music] just one glimpse of him [Music] what a day of rejoicing that will be when we all see jesus we'll sing and shout the victory i just had this picture frankie and johnny cross over on the other side dad's gonna have a rake and a shovel and a weed eater and say come on boys we got a little bit of yard work to do but no it won't be that way it'll all be well taken care of you're going to get to enter into the joys of the lord with dad i i remember the testimony there's two two folk two older brothers that i knew and both have passed on one of them was a landscaper and enjoyed just the the beauty of keeping everything nice and clean and neat and the other one liked to grow flowers and brother bill wiggins had passed away and some of the folks were making a comment saying we'll never get to see his beautiful flowers again but someone had a dream and brother bill came to him in the dream and he said if you think the flowers are beautiful on this side wait till you get to the other side if you think it's all beautiful just wait until you get to the other side and my brother-in-law's father passed away recently and that was his joy the last couple years of his life when he was able to he couldn't walk but he'd get on his hands and knees and clean the yard and do the landscaping on his hands and knees because he loved it so much so he's talking to to my sister and brother-in-law and he said but on the other side it'll all be done for him he'll get to enjoy every bit so there won't be no climbing up no palm trees no more there won't be no what a day that'll be amen so god bless you all may god comfort you strengthen you and i would say to you encourage one another keep talk to one another you know call up mom call up brother sister uncle aunt nephew nieces grandchildren whoever they are just check up on them say hi you're doing okay everything all right because one of these days it'll be the last time that you'll get together on this ideal beating together on the other side and it will be let's bow heads as we pray lord we've we've heard lord from the family and and lord and friends and those of us that got to know him work with him and to see brother frank and each one of us knew him a little bit differently a little part of life that maybe was different than then his wife got to know him that his children got to know him and then the grandchildren and so forth each one would have certain thoughts and and remembrances of him lord but the the most precious part of it is that he was part of you and you were part of him lord and he shared that with his family with his friends those around him whom he loved and he cared for lord and his desire and if he would have something to say to them he would tell them don't miss it make sure everything is ready all is well and prepared for that great eighth is coming forth soon lord comfort the lopez family the sotelo family each part of them lord because there will be days that they'll miss them there'll be times it'll be hard but you can comfort lord with the good memories in the precious times lord may we as a family of god stand with one than one another and comfort one another in this day lord [Music] jesus christ's name amen god bless you it's an honor to to be able to share to be part of the family today and do this because he was it was we got to know him when we first got here and has been been friends seeing the boys grow up seeing the family and all and it was a privilege for me to to do this so god bless you uh you know just spend a moment with each other here for a bit but please when we get ready to leave let's exit the building and then family again i encourage you encourage one another stand with one another a phone call sometimes it would encourage somebody they might just be feeling a little down you'll say hey just thinking about you is everything all right so god bless you have our sister priscilla i asked her if she would come and play some of the spanish songs that i heard her playing one of them and brought back memories so i know that brother frank and them some of the songs that we would sing in spanish some of them are in english spanish so as you go god bless you if she would do that now thank you sister lily for helping out sister anne it was good to hear you sing again god bless you thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so my friends [Music] so oh [Music] [Music] [Music]
