[12:29] God bless you all God bless you all we
[12:32] got a few prayer requests here and the

[12:41] will hear the prayer that the Lord will
[12:44] answer the prayer and as we've been
[12:45] hearing recently from the book of James
[12:47] the effectual fervent prayer of a
[12:49] righteous man ofth much if we pray
[12:51] according to his will and we know that
[12:54] it's his will that we pray for one
[12:55] another that we support one another
[12:57] Jesus is the comforter so I'm going to
[13:00] read these prayer requests if any of
[13:02] them strike you particularly then be

[29:21] um obviously a lot has changed since
[29:24] last
[29:25] Sunday I look I look a little different
[29:28] and uh the church looks a little
[29:30] different I like
[29:31] change brother Manny you look different
[29:33] too man it's good he shaved it too God
[29:36] bless you um I'm going to tell you
[29:39] something you already
[29:40] know the chairs that you're sitting in
[29:43] are very very
[29:44] uncomfortable right now and it's because
[29:47] they haven't been um they haven't been
[29:50] worked in so we'll try to have them all
[29:52] worked in and and much more comfortable
[29:55] for you uh next uh by by the next
[29:57] service I was uh it's funny we were I
[30:00] was I took off my
[30:02] shoes and the best way to work them in
[30:05] is you take off your shoes and you just
[30:06] go from chair to chair and I started
[30:08] over here the other night and uh young
[30:12] Kenneth
[30:15] Peterson was watching
[30:17] me I was going from chair to chair you
[30:20] know having fun
[30:22] and and he looks at me and I look down
[30:25] at
[30:26] him and he
[30:28] says can I do
[30:32] that I said yeah so it was funny how
[30:36] kids think wow I get to walk on the
[30:37] chairs in
[30:40] church so Kenneth and I we we made it we
[30:44] made a dent I mean his little feet you
[30:45] know they don't do much but uh he was he
[30:49] was with me in
[30:50] spirit um speaking of change I really do
[30:54] I I do like change and I I think God
[30:57] likes change in his people he gives us
[30:59] new things and those things encourage us
[31:02] and so we don't get stuck in a rut stuck
[31:05] in the same way that we do things what I
[31:07] want to do on uh on our Wednesday night
[31:10] services we'll continue on with a
[31:12] character in The Bible brother Lyle has
[31:14] been absolutely hitting home run with
[31:16] Joseph and doing and and explaining his
[31:20] life and and it's really it's been a
[31:21] blessing but I want to um throw some
[31:25] more in there and what I would like to
[31:27] do
[31:28] is on on some Wednesdays is I would like
[31:32] to take a topic brother Jordan suggested
[31:34] this and I thought it was a really good
[31:36] suggestion a more topical study for our
[31:39] Wednesday night Bible Bible study so
[31:42] what I'm going to do is I will take the
[31:45] the first subject this Wednesday is
[31:46] going to be on prayer and then we're
[31:48] going to be going through at Le probably
[31:51] every other week or every third week and
[31:54] uh we will be going teaching on a
[31:56] subject and bringing out that subject
[31:58] from the Bible for our Wednesday night
[32:00] bible study and then what I would like
[32:01] to do now here's the change you probably
[32:03] already knew that what I would like to
[32:05] do on the following Sunday we're not
[32:08] going to do it next Sunday but we will
[32:10] start uh um subsequent to that what I
[32:13] would like to do is I will teach on
[32:16] Wednesday night on a subject let's say
[32:20] it's it's on the schedule to teach on
[32:22] sin and then on the follow that's on
[32:26] Wednesday and then on the following
[32:28] Sunday night I would like to have some
[32:32] of the
[32:34] brothers give a 10 or a 15 minute sermon
[32:39] on that subject that we T that I taught
[32:43] on on Wednesday night and what gave me
[32:47] the idea was of uh some of you have been
[32:51] to the ministers meetings that we have
[32:52] here in Arizona they've been just a a
[32:54] tremendous
[32:55] success and I mean we get 40 or 50
[32:57] minutes ministers at at each meeting and
[33:01] what they do is they have a main speaker
[33:03] and then they have some of the minister
[33:06] Brothers they will speak for about 10
[33:08] minutes on the subject of the meeting
[33:12] and it's been really a blessing and I've
[33:14] been praying about doing it I'd like to
[33:16] do it now this doesn't you don't have to
[33:17] meet the qualifications of a pastor or a
[33:19] deacon to do this you could give a
[33:21] testimony about the subject or you can
[33:23] teach a small lesson on the subject and
[33:28] what furthered this is I had a a meeting
[33:31] with a um a new friend of mine he's a
[33:34] pastor in uh in
[33:37] Quebec and he was giving a testimony um
[33:41] about a a mutual friend of
[33:44] ours and this brother was in
[33:47] Jeffersonville at uh another friend of
[33:49] mine's Church um Nathan Bryant he was
[33:53] there and brother Nathan had some of the
[33:57] brothers in his his church come up and
[33:59] do the
[34:00] same and this brother that was from
[34:04] Canada when he was there he was so
[34:08] touched by these brothers coming up now
[34:11] they might not have been polish speakers
[34:12] they might not have been
[34:14] um real maybe versed in the word but
[34:18] they went up and they poured their heart
[34:20] out for this short amount of
[34:22] time and when this brother went back
[34:26] home it changed him and he said wow he
[34:31] said God can use
[34:34] anyone to preach the
[34:36] gospel it doesn't have to be the pastor
[34:38] in the Pulpit doesn't have to be a
[34:41] prophet it can be a brother in church
[34:45] gets up there and gives a message and it
[34:49] really changed this brother's life and
[34:52] then that was I don't know maybe a year
[34:54] ago or two and now that brother that was
[34:58] down there now he's the pastor he
[35:01] started up a new church now he is the
[35:04] pastor of a church and it all came from
[35:06] that one uh service in brother Nathan's
[35:10] Church in Jeffersonville so I I feel
[35:13] good about it so look at the subjects on
[35:16] the calendar and get with me or one of
[35:19] the deacons if you have something on
[35:21] your heart that you would like to speak
[35:23] on and we will uh as I always I try to
[35:26] keep it to an hour so we'll either have
[35:28] a 10 minute or a 15 minute session for
[35:32] each brother that goes up there 10 or 15
[35:34] minutes you can get a lot done in 10 or
[35:35] 15 minutes I promise so so we'll move
[35:38] forward on that and we'll see how the
[35:39] Lord the Lord leads there as I said I
[35:44] need I think change is
[35:46] important and we should always
[35:48] re-evaluate Our Lives constantly be
[35:51] re-evaluating our lives that's one of
[35:52] the things that is so important about
[35:54] communion communion gives us a chance to
[35:57] examine ourselves we really should do it
[35:59] every day but we we need to look at
[36:02] ourselves and say Lord am I am I doing
[36:04] right and I feel in my own life just my
[36:11] personal walk with the Lord I feel like
[36:14] the Lord has started to change in
[36:17] me and I'm excited to see which
[36:20] direction it's going to go but I
[36:21] definitely feel that I am
[36:24] changing and I Lord I don't know what
[36:27] what direction that that you want this
[36:30] to go or or what you have in store but I
[36:33] know that if he's changing me that it's
[36:36] going to be to serve you all because
[36:39] that's my job that's why he placed me
[36:40] here so I'm I'm excited to see where
[36:43] he's he's going in this um the
[36:49] uh subject
[36:51] today is this Parable that we must
[36:55] understand
[36:57] it's it's a the parable of what we call
[37:01] it is the sewer sewing
[37:04] seeds what a first of all we have to
[37:07] understand what a parable is and I've
[37:09] heard that a parable is it's an Earthly
[37:12] story with a Heavenly meaning it's like
[37:14] yeah it sounds pretty good I guess it's
[37:15] not not my my favorite way to explain a
[37:18] parable it it comes from the Greek word
[37:23] parabole
[37:24] parabole and it basically means means a
[37:29] comparison and Strong's Concordance says
[37:32] that uh that a parable parables are
[37:35] distinctive teaching method to convey
[37:39] confy a profound
[37:42] truth in a related relatable and
[37:45] memorable
[37:46] way they often involve everyday
[37:49] situations and characters making them
[37:51] accessible to a wide audience while also
[37:54] containing a deeper meaning for those
[37:57] willing to seek
[38:00] them in Jewish tradition Parables were a
[38:03] common teaching tool used by rabbis to
[38:06] confy ethical and Theological lessons
[38:09] Jesus's use of Parables was both was
[38:11] both Innovative and rooted in
[38:14] Tradition allowing him to communicate
[38:18] complex spiritual truths in a manner
[38:22] that was both engaging and
[38:24] thought-provoking Parables often contain
[38:27] elements of surprise or reversal
[38:30] challenging listeners to think
[38:32] critically and this is key to think
[38:35] critically and ref reflect on their own
[38:38] lives and
[38:40] beliefs it's really it's a simple
[38:42] narrative that illustrates a universal
[38:46] truth I've seen people take Parables
[38:48] I've seen ministers especially take
[38:50] Parables and they try to drill it down
[38:52] to a parable and try to Define Everyone
[38:56] by these Parables the wise fo the wise
[38:58] virgin and the foolish virgin is a very
[39:00] common one in our circle of people they
[39:03] try to say well this is the wise verg
[39:05] virgin and this is what the wise virgin
[39:08] believes and this is the foolish virgin
[39:10] over here and and this is this church
[39:12] and this is that church and this is this
[39:14] group of people and this is the wise
[39:16] virgin holds true to this and the
[39:18] foolish Virgin Goes to that don't do
[39:21] that that's not what a parable is meant
[39:24] for a parable is meant for you to take
[39:27] this story of something that you see
[39:29] every day and then apply it to your own
[39:34] life and it's really a masterpiece the
[39:36] way Jesus did it is he took things that
[39:38] that people see every day and then he
[39:41] says now here is the meaning of this so
[39:44] so in this one these these people that
[39:46] were listening to Jesus they're going to
[39:47] walk by a farm or probably most of them
[39:50] were farmers or work working on a farm
[39:52] and now they're going to think about
[39:55] these things that Jesus said every day
[39:57] day you know we might tell a parable of
[40:00] a more modern thing driving a stoplight
[40:04] or whatever and it's something that will
[40:06] bring those things to our
[40:08] remembrance but don't miss the
[40:11] foundational purpose of a parable a
[40:14] parable should be used to judge
[40:17] yourself and not to judge others which
[40:21] means that you should not try to divide
[40:25] others into these different different
[40:27] groups but you can and you should take
[40:31] yourself and put yourself into these
[40:34] different groups that Jesus separates
[40:37] apart now to understand this parable of
[40:39] of the sewer and the seeds you have to
[40:41] understand the basics of farming and I'm
[40:44] not talking about modern Farms today
[40:46] where they they have the big tractors
[40:47] and they they till the ground and then
[40:49] they lay the seeds and it's it's the
[40:51] same concept but back in Jerusalem time
[40:57] 2,000 years
[40:59] ago probably the people that were
[41:01] listening to him as I said were probably
[41:03] mostly or a good portion of them were
[41:05] farmers so they knew all of these things
[41:08] that Jesus is talking about he talks
[41:10] about the different types of
[41:14] soils and that's the key to this Parable
[41:18] is the
[41:20] soil it's not the SE and it's not the
[41:23] seed it's the soil and we are the soil
[41:28] in this Parable that's key to understand
[41:30] this you know we always think about the
[41:34] seed being the main focus here but it's
[41:37] not it's if that seed will find fertile
[41:40] ground so Jesus talks about different
[41:43] types of of farm different types of
[41:45] seeds that are spread out across the
[41:47] field so you have have a field that's
[41:49] tilled and then the farmer will go out
[41:52] and he will spread his seeds in that
[41:54] field while some of the seeds will fall
[41:57] all beside the field and there were
[42:00] trails that that walked along these
[42:03] fields and those Trails Were Meant to
[42:04] walk on so they were pressed
[42:07] hard and and they they didn't they
[42:10] weren't meant for farming they were
[42:12] meant for walking or driving your your
[42:14] riding your horse on or your chariot or
[42:16] whatever so they were hard packed and
[42:19] then outside of the field there were
[42:22] other places that didn't get necessarily
[42:25] tilled that the weeds were growing up
[42:27] and and you see that around the edges
[42:30] and then there were Fields there were
[42:33] areas in the Judean landscape and and
[42:36] many of you have been there as I have
[42:38] been there that you see a lot of Bedrock
[42:40] on the sides of these Hills and then
[42:43] you'll see some Terraces there and those
[42:47] areas have just a little bit of soil on
[42:51] top of them and then below them it's
[42:53] Bedrock so it's very hard for something
[42:56] you couldn't you couldn't Farm in those
[42:59] areas because the Bedrock is so high and
[43:01] the soil is so thin so he's going to
[43:04] talk about those different places and
[43:06] talk about how a farmer will go out and
[43:08] sew his his his
[43:11] seed so the um and it it will talk about
[43:15] four different types of people and Jesus
[43:21] had already done great Miracles he had
[43:23] already really established himself as a
[43:26] prophet and people a lot of people were
[43:28] following him so what Jesus does in this
[43:31] case is it's there's too many people
[43:34] around so he gets in a
[43:36] boat and the boat is pushed off a little
[43:40] ways off of the bank and then he's
[43:43] preaching to the crowd from this boat
[43:47] just to give you a sense of what's going
[43:49] on
[43:51] here so let's get it to it let's
[43:55] um start with
[43:58] Mark chapter
[44:00] 4
[44:03] and this Parable is in three different
[44:06] gospels Matthew Mark and Luke and in
[44:10] Luke when Luke starts this same
[44:16] narrative Luke points out he says this
[44:21] he says soon afterwards Jesus began a
[44:23] tour of the nearby towns and Villages
[44:24] preaching and announcing the good news
[44:27] about the kingdom of God he took his 12
[44:29] disciples with him along with some women
[44:32] Luke is very um careful to point out the
[44:36] women in this
[44:38] one along with them some women who had
[44:41] who had been cured of evil dis evil
[44:43] spirits and diseases among them were
[44:45] Mary
[44:46] Magdalene from whom he had cast out
[44:48] seven demons Joanna the wife of chuza
[44:52] herod's business manager Suzanna and
[44:55] many others who were contri contributing
[44:57] from their own resources to support
[44:59] Jesus and his disciples so Luke is quick
[45:03] to point out that this isn't just
[45:05] men that this
[45:08] Parable is for everyone it's for women
[45:12] it's for men it's really it's for the
[45:14] old it's for the young
[45:16] amen and he's when Jesus is talking
[45:21] about a parable he's going to start
[45:23] separating people and these parables as
[45:27] you'll see from some of the things that
[45:28] Jesus said they are serious we think of
[45:33] them just being oh this is a nice story
[45:34] then I can remember no we're going to
[45:37] read here in this in this Parable that
[45:39] Jesus says that if you can't understand
[45:42] this Parable that I'm talking about
[45:44] right now you're not going to understand
[45:45] anything else that I
[45:46] say that's how important this Parable is
[45:50] he says if you can't understand this one
[45:53] then you're not going to understand any
[45:54] of the other Parables that's how
[45:56] important
[45:57] what I'm saying in uh this morning is
[46:02] vitally important we have to understand
[46:06] this
[46:08] one
[46:09] Mark chter 4 verse one it says this and
[46:15] he began again to teach by the
[46:18] seaside and there was gathered unto him
[46:20] a great multitude so that he entered
[46:22] into a ship and sat in the sea and the
[46:25] whole multitude was by the sea
[46:27] on the
[46:31] land and he taught them many things by
[46:34] Parables and said unto them unto them in
[46:38] his Doctrine hearken behold there went
[46:41] out so he says listen to me so he's he's
[46:44] talking and then he probably raised his
[46:45] voice and he said Hey listen listen to
[46:47] what I'm
[46:50] saying hearken behold there went out a s
[46:55] to sow the S is a farmer as I said
[46:58] earlier this one's he is the one that's
[47:00] planting his
[47:01] field and it came to pass it went out a
[47:04] SE or to se and it came to pass as he
[47:06] sowed some fell by the
[47:08] wayside and the fowls of the air came
[47:11] and devoured it up and some fell on
[47:14] Stony ground where it had not much Earth
[47:17] and immediately it sprang up because it
[47:20] had no depth of Earth but when the sun
[47:23] was up it was scorched and because it
[47:26] had no root it withered away and some
[47:30] fell among thorns and and the Thorns
[47:33] grew up and choked it and yielded no
[47:36] fruit and the other fell on good
[47:38] ground and it did yield fruit that
[47:41] sprang up and increased and brought
[47:44] forth some 30 some 60 and some a 100 and
[47:49] he said unto them he that hath ears to
[47:51] hear Let Him hear what a statement that
[47:55] he says just right there he that has
[47:57] ears let him hear and he the the the NLT
[48:03] translation says anyone with ears to
[48:06] hear should listen and
[48:10] understand everyone who was in that
[48:13] crowd that day they all probably I would
[48:15] assume they all had
[48:17] ears and he's looking out and he said
[48:19] every one of you listen to what I'm
[48:21] saying because this is very
[48:24] important in other places he said don't
[48:26] Harden your
[48:29] heart Hebrews chapter
[48:31] 3 verse 14 says for we have become
[48:34] partakers of Christ if we hold the
[48:36] beginning of our confidence steadfast to
[48:38] the end while it is said now he's going
[48:41] to quote a Psalm this is this is the
[48:43] Apostle speaking today if you will hear
[48:45] his voice do not Harden your
[48:48] hearts as in the
[48:51] Rebellion for who having heard rebelled
[48:54] indeed was it not all who came out of
[48:56] Egypt led by Moses the
[49:00] prophet and later on he says so we see
[49:04] that they could not enter in because of
[49:07] their unbelief they hardened their
[49:09] hearts they hardened their ears to where
[49:11] they wouldn't hear God's word this
[49:14] Parable that it's all about the word
[49:17] it's about the word and it is about the
[49:20] soil verse number
[49:22] 10 Mark Mark uh chapter markk chapter
[49:25] 4:10 and when he was alone they were
[49:29] about him with the TW with the twel
[49:32] asked they that they that were about him
[49:36] with the twel asked of him the parable
[49:39] and he said unto them unto them unto you
[49:41] it is given to know the mystery of the
[49:43] kingdom of God but unto them that are
[49:46] without to them that are outside all
[49:49] these things are done in
[49:51] Parables that seeing they may see and
[49:54] not perceive and hearing
[49:57] they may hear and not understand lest at
[50:01] any time they should be converted and
[50:03] their sins should be forgiven them what
[50:07] an odd
[50:08] statement what a s strange thing for
[50:11] Jesus to say he says I'm speaking this
[50:14] in stories so that you can understand
[50:18] and that they won't understand you would
[50:21] think that Jesus would be up there
[50:22] saying I want everybody to understand
[50:24] and I want everybody to listen to me and
[50:26] then everybody everybody will be saved
[50:28] but that's not what he says right here
[50:31] he says so that some
[50:34] won't understand and that they won't
[50:38] repent but unto you it is given the
[50:40] kingdom he's actually Jesus is quoting a
[50:45] prophecy that was given by the prophet
[50:48] Isaiah you know the story about Isaiah
[50:51] when when he came before the Lord and He
[50:54] Saw God sitting on the throne grown and
[50:57] he saw all the angels surround about
[51:00] around about him flying around with
[51:02] wings on their feet to cover their feet
[51:04] and and wings over their faces to cover
[51:06] their faces in the Holy presence of God
[51:08] and the other wings that they flew and
[51:11] and he and and Isaiah looked up and he
[51:13] says oh he he came in the presence of
[51:15] God he says I'm a man of unclean lips
[51:18] and I dwell among people of unclean lips
[51:21] it just struck him how low he was and
[51:23] how great God is and here's Isa Isaiah
[51:27] and he says he even says he says I saw
[51:29] God you know in the Bible it says that
[51:31] is Isaiah was sought in
[51:33] half in history brother Lyall I assume
[51:37] it's in the
[51:38] talmid the reason that Isaiah was sought
[51:41] in half is because he said that I saw
[51:46] God and they all said no you can't see
[51:49] God no man can see God and live so they
[51:53] put Isaiah to death but here's Isa
[51:57] isah and and he and he's he's seeing all
[52:00] of
[52:01] this and then and he says I'm a man of
[52:05] unclean lips and I'm so low and and
[52:08] then the voice comes out and said who
[52:12] will
[52:14] go and then Isaiah says oh Lord here am
[52:18] I send me now we know that story but
[52:22] what was he supposed to
[52:24] do that's the thing that we may not not
[52:26] have
[52:27] known well you just keep
[52:30] reading and it says
[52:33] this then I said Isaiah chapter
[52:37] 6 verse 8 then I said here am I send
[52:42] me and he said go and tell this
[52:46] people to keep on hearing I'm reading
[52:48] the new King James version keep on
[52:51] hearing but do not
[52:54] understand keep on seeing but do not
[52:56] perceive make the heart of this people
[52:59] dull and make their ears
[53:02] heavy and shut their eyes lest lest they
[53:05] see with their eyes and hear with their
[53:08] ears and understand with their heart and
[53:11] return and be
[53:13] healed so this this whole story with
[53:17] with the the The Throne of God and and
[53:20] Isaiah and he says Lord send me these
[53:22] are his instructions and now Jesus in
[53:25] this Parable he is saying here is the
[53:27] Fulfillment of
[53:30] that the New Living Translation of Mark
[53:34] 4:1 says he replied you are permitted to
[53:38] understand the kingdom of God but I use
[53:40] Parables for everything I say to
[53:42] Outsiders so the scriptures might be
[53:44] fulfilled when they when they see what I
[53:47] do they will learn
[53:49] nothing according Isaiah when they hear
[53:52] what I say they will not understand
[53:55] otherwise listen to this brother Joel
[53:59] otherwise they will turn to me and be
[54:04] forgiven then Jesus said to them if you
[54:08] cannot understand the meaning of this
[54:10] Parable how will you understand all of
[54:12] the other
[54:13] Parables so look at the importance here
[54:17] and he's saying that there's going to be
[54:19] these other people they're going to come
[54:21] and I'm speaking to them in Parables and
[54:23] they're not going to understand and
[54:24] they're going to be lost and you are
[54:26] going to understand and you're going to
[54:27] be saved but if I was straight with them
[54:29] maybe they wouldn't be lost it's strange
[54:33] huh what he saying is there are
[54:36] different classes of people coming to
[54:38] hear these
[54:40] stories
[54:42] some are coming because they heard of
[54:44] the fishes and the
[54:46] Loaves and they're hungry like man I'm
[54:49] going to go up there that guy feeds
[54:50] everybody he fed them fish and bread and
[54:52] this last one I'm going to go up there
[54:54] I'm going to get some fish and bread
[54:56] others are coming to criticize they're
[54:59] coming to be Skeptics he's a false
[55:02] prophet because he doesn't preach what
[55:03] the Pharisees
[55:05] preach others are coming it's just like
[55:07] well my mom wanted me to come to come to
[55:09] church today to hear this Prophet so I'm
[55:11] going to go you know just I just
[55:13] pacifier there's others coming like
[55:16] that some
[55:18] people
[55:19] come because they want to see a
[55:22] miracle they want to be entertained
[55:26] oh I've heard all of these Miracles like
[55:28] going to the circus oh I want to see I
[55:30] want to see this oh that's going to be
[55:33] cool some of them really did come for
[55:36] that but then others came because they
[55:38] were
[55:39] sick others came because they needed to
[55:42] be healed others came because they were
[55:43] repenting and they knew that they were
[55:45] wrong and they wanted salvation they
[55:47] heard that this man was the Messiah of
[55:50] God and they wanted to bow down before
[55:52] him and say Lord forgive me of my sins
[55:53] there's those that that also so there
[55:56] are different classes of people coming
[55:58] and here is Jesus and he's saying that
[56:00] they're coming some of them are going to
[56:02] be blind some of them are going to be
[56:04] dull of hearing the other ones are going
[56:06] to
[56:08] live so he's that's what he's saying in
[56:13] this it's
[56:15] amazing pretty much every PR Parable
[56:18] that we
[56:19] hear really addresses two classes of
[56:24] people there's the ones if you can
[56:27] understand them and then Place yourself
[56:30] in these classes of
[56:32] people it IT addresses those people and
[56:35] then IT addresses the people that aren't
[56:38] Believers two different groups a parable
[56:43] really they bring
[56:46] judgment you come there you're not
[56:50] worthy you go there because you just
[56:52] want to be and it's same thing with
[56:54] church this is all all about the word
[56:57] when we come to church it's not because
[57:01] we have a potluck in the fellowship hall
[57:03] it's not because we have kids up in the
[57:06] upper room that you can fellowship with
[57:08] it's not because that we have a
[57:12] pickleball game we come to church to
[57:16] hear the
[57:17] word that is why we are here and then we
[57:20] take that word and then you see the
[57:22] different people you'll see these these
[57:24] different soils some will take it and
[57:26] they come here just to criticize and if
[57:28] you look for something to criticize
[57:30] you'll find it just as they looked at
[57:32] Jesus Christ and found stuff to
[57:34] criticize on him they say you hang out
[57:36] with a bunch of worldly
[57:38] people you hang out with a bunch of
[57:41] drunkards prostitutes Tax Collectors
[57:45] that's who your friends are Jesus how
[57:46] could you be a prophet of God they came
[57:49] to
[57:51] criticize but others truly came for what
[57:55] they needed
[57:57] they needed a change in their life they
[57:58] needed to be healed they there was
[58:00] something within them that said I need
[58:04] change the critic showed up to see a
[58:07] miracle showed up to see a prophet
[58:09] showed up to maybe other on showed up to
[58:12] shout in the
[58:14] spirit others showed up to run to the
[58:16] altar others showed up to prove that
[58:18] they are the bride of
[58:21] Christ and they all say I went there I
[58:24] wanted to shout and we didn't shout I
[58:25] wanted to praise we didn't praise I
[58:27] wanted to see a prophet we didn't see a
[58:29] prophet I wanted to see prophets I you
[58:30] know what he did he told a story about a
[58:33] farmer wasn't even a good
[58:36] story it was just about a farmer and how
[58:38] he he swws the field and then some of
[58:41] the seeds don't
[58:43] germinate you see Isaiah
[58:46] prophesying some
[58:50] came and they were
[58:52] blessed others came and they didn't care
[58:57] verse number
[58:58] 13 and he said unto them know ye not
[59:02] this Parable how then will you know all
[59:04] the Parables so if you don't understand
[59:07] this you're not going to understand any
[59:09] of them I remember when I was in when I
[59:12] was in college and I I took this class
[59:15] is brother Tim here I took this class
[59:17] electricity and magnetism it was one of
[59:19] the physics classes for
[59:20] engineering and I started in there and
[59:24] wow I had no idea what was going
[59:27] on I was like I'm history there is no
[59:30] way and I imagine these disciples when
[59:33] they were listening to Jesus and he said
[59:35] if you don't understand this you're
[59:36] going to fail the class if you don't
[59:39] understand this then you're not going to
[59:40] get anything and I see Peter like dude I
[59:43] have no idea what he's talking
[59:47] about but then
[59:49] Jesus explains to them
[59:54] more the swer
[59:57] SWS the
[59:58] word this is the only explanation of the
[1:00:00] s in the entire Parable in all three
[1:00:04] gospels we focus on who is sowing the
[1:00:10] word we focus on the prophet we focus on
[1:00:16] the pastor we focus on the Apostle the
[1:00:19] Evangelist the teacher we focused on all
[1:00:22] those things and here Jesus is saying
[1:00:24] hey if you don't understand this you
[1:00:25] don't understand anything anything and
[1:00:26] that's the end that's the swer doesn't
[1:00:28] even have a a really big place in this
[1:00:32] whole thing he is just putting out the
[1:00:35] word we were talking as I said I want to
[1:00:37] have some of the brothers come up
[1:00:40] they're spreading the word that's what
[1:00:42] I'm doing I'm spreading the word and
[1:00:44] they will fall on good
[1:00:46] ground and then it will also fall on
[1:00:49] people that really don't care it's like
[1:00:51] I'm here yeah he's got he always
[1:00:53] finishes right at 11:35 so we have 30
[1:00:59] minutes it's
[1:01:02] here then there's
[1:01:04] others that are listening and say what's
[1:01:07] he trying to
[1:01:08] say and get offended at it but then
[1:01:11] there are others that are truly here to
[1:01:14] say Lord I want to accept your word I
[1:01:18] wanna Lord I want to know I want to I
[1:01:20] want to be better I want to serve
[1:01:22] you this Ser he's a farmer
[1:01:27] he's not the most important thing in
[1:01:29] this the important thing is where these
[1:01:33] the important thing is the seed or else
[1:01:35] no life could come
[1:01:36] forward and then it's the ground and
[1:01:40] there's four different kinds of ground
[1:01:43] three of them are bad one of them is
[1:01:48] receptive and one of them is
[1:01:51] good and
[1:01:53] these are they by the way side where the
[1:01:57] word is sown but they have heard but
[1:02:00] when they have heard Satan cometh
[1:02:02] immediately and taketh away the word
[1:02:04] that was sown in their hearts so the
[1:02:07] word comes to them they hear it but they
[1:02:10] don't have ears to hear they hear it
[1:02:12] they don't care and not even a blade of
[1:02:14] grass shoots up nothing happens they
[1:02:18] might come to church and it's like yeah
[1:02:20] whatever I I you know I just I don't
[1:02:22] like it that path that I was talking
[1:02:25] about earlier
[1:02:26] it's hard it can't take a seed it can't
[1:02:29] grow
[1:02:30] anything and it's quickly eaten by the
[1:02:33] birds or the mice or or whatever it is
[1:02:35] that eat seeds and then those they don't
[1:02:37] even have a chance to
[1:02:40] sprout they're not coming to receive
[1:02:43] correction they're not coming to be a
[1:02:45] better person they are coming for
[1:02:47] something
[1:02:48] else maybe it's to do a favor to Grandma
[1:02:53] maybe it's it's for Mom I I I'll show up
[1:02:55] to church
[1:02:56] and they and then and then I you know I
[1:02:59] won't have to do anymore you know maybe
[1:03:01] it's watching YouTube of this video so
[1:03:03] they can
[1:03:04] criticize
[1:03:06] it's they sit in service and and and
[1:03:09] listen the minds wander as I said you're
[1:03:12] counting down the time watching the
[1:03:17] clock thinking and there's no service
[1:03:21] tonight
[1:03:23] no I'm serious
[1:03:28] think about it why are you here this
[1:03:31] morning this is an important morning
[1:03:33] this may be the most important morning
[1:03:35] of your life and you're here and you're
[1:03:38] just sitting in the Pew as the chairs
[1:03:39] are uncomfortable they were sitting on
[1:03:41] the ground
[1:03:43] here and it was probably Rocky I've been
[1:03:46] to the Sea of
[1:03:48] Galilee it was not as comfortable as our
[1:03:53] chairs thank you I like them you're
[1:03:56] going to love them too they will be
[1:03:58] comfortable I'm not you don't have to
[1:03:59] sit on a rock
[1:04:01] um stand on the
[1:04:04] Rock
[1:04:06] Amen there are I see two classes of
[1:04:10] people here brother I see one group as I
[1:04:13] just said that really could care less
[1:04:16] they're just here for another
[1:04:19] reason and then I see another group one
[1:04:24] thing is I'll I'll tell one story on
[1:04:28] this group that that they don't really
[1:04:30] want to be here I was ministering a
[1:04:33] while ago and I noticed the church was
[1:04:35] pretty full and I noticed that there was
[1:04:37] a man that I didn't recognize and he was
[1:04:39] sitting right about where you are
[1:04:41] brother Jeremiah and and I read this
[1:04:45] scripture to start the service 1
[1:04:48] Corinthians chapter 6 don't you don't
[1:04:50] have to go there but it says this no you
[1:04:53] yourselves do wrong and cheat and you do
[1:04:56] things to your brethren do you not know
[1:04:59] that the unrighteous will not inherit
[1:05:00] the kingdom of God do not be deceived
[1:05:03] neither fornicators nor idolators nor
[1:05:05] adulterers nor homosexuals nor sodomites
[1:05:08] nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkards
[1:05:10] nor revelers nor
[1:05:11] extortioners will inherit the kingdom of
[1:05:13] God and such were some of you and man
[1:05:16] that guy got up and
[1:05:19] left he was and I could tell he's like
[1:05:22] no I'm not going to come in here to be
[1:05:24] preached at
[1:05:28] he if he would have
[1:05:30] stayed the sermon was like Hey we're all
[1:05:34] Sinners but he's like no I'm not going
[1:05:36] to be preached that and he got up and
[1:05:37] man he stormed out it's like okay well
[1:05:40] that's that group and I'm not condemning
[1:05:42] that brother I don't know who he was and
[1:05:44] I've never seen him before I never seen
[1:05:46] him since but I know the Lord knows him
[1:05:49] but second there's that group they
[1:05:53] really don't want to be here they don't
[1:05:54] want they don't want the Lord but second
[1:05:57] and I hate to say this but is the
[1:05:59] religious man or a woman hard
[1:06:04] ground this is what I believe and if it
[1:06:07] doesn't doesn't match that then I don't
[1:06:09] believe it hard ground second
[1:06:14] Timothy says that they shall Heap for
[1:06:16] themselves
[1:06:17] teachers having itching years and I've
[1:06:21] witnessed it over and over again
[1:06:23] brothers and sisters there a couple
[1:06:25] years ago when remember the Asbury
[1:06:27] Revival at the college was going on it
[1:06:29] was an exciting time and it was it was
[1:06:31] even the news and a minister texted me
[1:06:35] and he says what do you think about all
[1:06:37] this and I told him I said I'm all for
[1:06:40] it he responded I'm seeing a lot of
[1:06:43] women in
[1:06:44] pants a lot of long-haired men a lot of
[1:06:47] CER college
[1:06:49] students brother they were praying all
[1:06:53] night that ground is hard
[1:06:56] there is no place God no no seed of God
[1:07:00] can take root in that
[1:07:02] place critic criticize and that religion
[1:07:05] religious spirit let's uh let's just go
[1:07:07] let's go to Second Timothy 4 for the
[1:07:10] time will
[1:07:12] come when they will not endure sound
[1:07:15] Doctrine but after their own lusts that
[1:07:18] word lust and our modern language has a
[1:07:21] sexual connotation that's not the case
[1:07:23] here after their own desire s after
[1:07:26] their own
[1:07:28] wants they shall Heap to themselves
[1:07:31] teachers having itching ears and they
[1:07:34] shall turn away from turn away their
[1:07:37] ears from the truth and it shall be
[1:07:39] turned to
[1:07:40] fables let me read another translation
[1:07:42] the Amplified version says this for the
[1:07:45] for the time will come when people will
[1:07:47] not tolerate sound Doctrine and accurate
[1:07:49] instruction that challenges them with
[1:07:52] God's
[1:07:54] truth but wanting to have their ears
[1:07:58] tickled with something pleasing they
[1:08:00] will accumulate for themselves many
[1:08:03] teachers one after another chosen to
[1:08:07] satisfy their own desires and to support
[1:08:11] the errors they
[1:08:13] hold that's the
[1:08:15] truth and will turn their ears away from
[1:08:19] the truth and wander off into myths and
[1:08:22] man-made fictions and will accept the
[1:08:29] unacceptable these are people in
[1:08:32] churches and what they want they want
[1:08:35] the preacher to preach their own
[1:08:36] Doctrine they want the preacher to
[1:08:38] preach their own narrative so that's who
[1:08:41] they put in front of them because this
[1:08:43] agrees with the way that I think
[1:08:46] it this is a
[1:08:49] prophecy from Paul to Timothy saying
[1:08:52] that this time will come
[1:08:56] there are certain things that they want
[1:08:57] to hear and instead of hearing something
[1:09:00] new something fresh like the teachings
[1:09:03] of Christ they want to hear what feels
[1:09:06] comfortable to
[1:09:07] them the word of God is not
[1:09:12] comfortable it challenges you that's and
[1:09:15] I know a lot of people don't want to
[1:09:17] hear it a lot of people don't want to
[1:09:18] know that Jesus actually preached
[1:09:19] against preached hell and he preached
[1:09:22] against sin he talks more about hell
[1:09:25] than he does about heaven it's like no
[1:09:27] no no no no no no yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:09:29] yeah if you if you don't want to hear
[1:09:32] those things don't open this
[1:09:35] book because it has condemnation in
[1:09:38] there the Bible is not
[1:09:43] comfortable it's
[1:09:45] not it challenges you to
[1:09:48] change every single one of
[1:09:52] us and these verse number 14
[1:09:57] Mark and these are they likewise which
[1:09:59] are sewn on Stony ground who when they
[1:10:01] have heard the word immediately they
[1:10:03] receive it with gladness so this is
[1:10:05] different from that hard spirit that
[1:10:07] hard either atheist Spirit or doesn't
[1:10:09] care about God or from that hard
[1:10:11] religious spirit this is something
[1:10:13] different there's actually some ground
[1:10:14] there there's some soil to receive
[1:10:18] it this is this is there is something to
[1:10:21] this
[1:10:22] person these are the people who come to
[1:10:25] church and they have a good
[1:10:27] attitude but it's not important enough
[1:10:30] to them to stay with
[1:10:31] it they don't study at home they don't
[1:10:35] spend time in prayer they don't get
[1:10:37] their families together to read the
[1:10:38] Bible brother Manny I got to tell you
[1:10:40] you blessed me so much yesterday I
[1:10:43] talked to um brotheru on the
[1:10:46] phone and he told me he says sometimes
[1:10:48] brother he says on my break or on my
[1:10:50] lunch he says I just call up Grace and
[1:10:53] we read the Bible
[1:10:57] we talk about the
[1:10:58] word that's what it is you have to have
[1:11:00] it all the time that's that good soil
[1:11:03] but this rocky soil didn't have that it
[1:11:06] sprung up it's like I like it a little
[1:11:08] bit but it doesn't there's nothing there
[1:11:12] to get your roots
[1:11:14] into do you take it home or do you just
[1:11:18] come to church on Sunday
[1:11:20] morning some of you just come to Sunday
[1:11:22] on Sunday morning that's not enough some
[1:11:24] of you come on Sunday morning and Sunday
[1:11:26] night that's twice as good but it's not
[1:11:28] enough some of you come on Wednesday and
[1:11:31] Sunday morning and Sunday night that's
[1:11:33] three times as good but it's not
[1:11:36] enough you need to live this life you
[1:11:39] need to stay in this word all the time
[1:11:41] that seed that's within you has to be
[1:11:43] watered
[1:11:45] constantly that is the good ground this
[1:11:47] Rocky ground there's nothing there as I
[1:11:49] said earlier it just has just a little
[1:11:51] bit of soil and it can't hold the
[1:11:54] moisture the key to this whole thing is
[1:11:56] the
[1:11:58] moisture the key to a crop in in Israel
[1:12:03] is that you get moisture to it and the
[1:12:05] proper moisture the rock or let's say
[1:12:08] gravel here it doesn't hold anything you
[1:12:11] know you can have a pile of rocks in
[1:12:12] your yard and it rains and you can see
[1:12:14] some little weeds popping up in there
[1:12:17] but when it stops raining and the Sun
[1:12:20] comes out and the heat is put on it they
[1:12:24] just die
[1:12:25] they just go away and that's with
[1:12:29] us when we may Sprout we may be doing
[1:12:32] good and everything's great but when the
[1:12:34] heat comes
[1:12:36] down are we able to stay with
[1:12:39] it when the Temptation
[1:12:42] comes the temptation to
[1:12:44] sin are we are we able to stay with
[1:12:48] it I planted a tree
[1:12:51] yesterday and it was a mosquite tree and
[1:12:54] the roots for mosquite they go way down
[1:12:57] and as I was digging the hole um I hit
[1:13:00] kichi after like a foot and man that
[1:13:04] stuff's hard so and it doesn't it
[1:13:06] doesn't hold any moisture it's just it's
[1:13:08] just a it's a like concrete so what I
[1:13:10] did is I dug with a pick I dug down in
[1:13:13] there and kept going down as far as I
[1:13:15] could get down in there and then
[1:13:17] replaced it with some with some soil
[1:13:20] that had some good Organics in it I I
[1:13:23] got some the bags of Mo or the bags of
[1:13:26] the top soil and I mixed it up with the
[1:13:27] soil and then put it down in there so
[1:13:30] that tree had a place to put out its
[1:13:33] roots and that's with our soil if it's
[1:13:36] just hard kichi that tree is not going
[1:13:39] to get big that tree is not going to
[1:13:40] bear fruit you need to have a good base
[1:13:45] a good hole with good soil in it that
[1:13:48] can hold the water or else you're going
[1:13:50] to be watering the thing every day and
[1:13:52] then if you go on vacation the dumb
[1:13:54] thing's going to die
[1:13:58] why because it it doesn't hold
[1:14:02] water many times water represents the
[1:14:07] word in the
[1:14:09] Bible they said coming to church is
[1:14:11] important but more than that the soil
[1:14:15] has to have this constant flow of
[1:14:17] moisture Jeremiah 177 says this blessed
[1:14:21] is the
[1:14:22] man who trusts in the Lord and who whose
[1:14:25] hope is in the Lord for he shall be like
[1:14:27] a tree planted by Waters which spreads
[1:14:29] out its roots by the river and will not
[1:14:32] fear when the heat
[1:14:35] comes but its Leaf will be
[1:14:37] green and will not be anxious in the
[1:14:40] year of drought nor will cease from
[1:14:43] yielding
[1:14:44] fruit that's that tree that's planted in
[1:14:47] good soil that has water in it if you
[1:14:50] throw a bunch of seeds as I said out out
[1:14:51] in the gravel they might Sprout up but
[1:14:54] they they
[1:14:58] die verse number 17 they have no root in
[1:15:03] themselves and so endure but for a time
[1:15:06] and afterwards with Affliction or P
[1:15:09] persecution arises for the word sake
[1:15:11] immediately they are
[1:15:13] offended most translations say
[1:15:16] immediately they fall
[1:15:17] away soon as they get embarrassed in
[1:15:19] front of their friends for not
[1:15:21] drinking soon as they as soon as they
[1:15:24] get embarrassed for making a stand
[1:15:26] against some of these ridiculous woke
[1:15:28] ideas that we have today as soon as they
[1:15:31] get embarrassed when the pastor condemns
[1:15:34] sin and maybe calls out something that
[1:15:36] they are doing I'm not going
[1:15:40] back the gospel as I said it's
[1:15:45] offensive there are consequences to our
[1:15:51] sins in this very example
[1:15:55] there are three failures and one
[1:15:58] success and that's usually how it is and
[1:16:01] these are they which are sown among
[1:16:04] Thorns such as hear the word and the
[1:16:06] cares of this world and the
[1:16:08] deceitfulness of riches and the lust of
[1:16:10] other things enter in choke the word and
[1:16:13] it becomes un and it becometh
[1:16:17] unfruitful so the Thorns the these fell
[1:16:19] on good ground this is the saddest one
[1:16:22] of all of to me this fell on good ground
[1:16:25] good water good soil and it Springs
[1:16:30] up and it's looking good full of
[1:16:33] moisture but there is no separation in
[1:16:36] this one between God and the
[1:16:39] world and if you don't separate yourself
[1:16:41] from the
[1:16:42] world and you try to live both the
[1:16:45] world's going to
[1:16:47] win 100% of the time if you will not
[1:16:50] separate
[1:16:52] yourself the world's going to win
[1:16:55] these are the people they have one foot
[1:16:57] in church they have the other foot in
[1:17:00] sin you have good soil brother you have
[1:17:04] good soil
[1:17:05] sister and Christianity might
[1:17:09] grow but you can even you can even apply
[1:17:12] these Christian principles to your own
[1:17:14] life and you can be successful at work
[1:17:16] but while that seed of God is prospering
[1:17:19] in your life so is the seed of Satan
[1:17:22] prospering in your
[1:17:23] life this is so common and you see
[1:17:27] people walking one foot in the world one
[1:17:29] foot in with
[1:17:32] God it's popular to say you're a
[1:17:34] Christian and you feel like you're
[1:17:36] making a s stand to say you're a
[1:17:37] Christian but your life the Love of
[1:17:40] Money the desire to be respected the
[1:17:42] desire to have an important position the
[1:17:44] desire of fle Flesh through sexual
[1:17:47] indiscretions not going to church
[1:17:49] because you stayed up too late the night
[1:17:51] before playing video games or watching
[1:17:53] movies
[1:17:55] what's more important to you they're
[1:17:56] growing this they're
[1:17:58] growing which one's which one's going to
[1:18:00] choke the other one
[1:18:02] out you're up too late last night
[1:18:04] playing video games or watching a movie
[1:18:05] surfing the web watching YouTube shorts
[1:18:08] Tik
[1:18:09] Tok Instagram and here you are this
[1:18:12] morning is it really important to
[1:18:18] you there's a number 20 and these are
[1:18:22] they which are swn on good ground such
[1:18:24] as hear the word and receive it and
[1:18:26] bring forth fruit some 30-fold some 60
[1:18:29] some 100 and here's what happens when
[1:18:31] that good ground receives the word it
[1:18:36] produces
[1:18:38] fruit you've
[1:18:40] changed so your husband starts coming
[1:18:43] your wife starts coming your children
[1:18:46] see your change and they want the same
[1:18:48] thing that you have your friends see the
[1:18:50] change in you and then they want that
[1:18:52] change that is the good soil
[1:18:56] the soil that you see out in the farm
[1:18:58] with the wheat
[1:18:59] growing it's been fertilized the rocks
[1:19:02] have been taken
[1:19:03] out and throughout the world here in
[1:19:08] Southern Arizona too you'll see along in
[1:19:11] farming areas or former farming areas
[1:19:14] you see these walls made of rock made of
[1:19:16] stones and what has happened is when the
[1:19:19] farmer and the workers are tilling the
[1:19:22] the soil and they see a stone there they
[1:19:25] pick it up and they take it out and they
[1:19:27] set it over on the
[1:19:29] side and then they continue so they get
[1:19:32] those stones out and that's how it is
[1:19:35] for
[1:19:36] us we could we don't have that Stony
[1:19:39] ground and the better the more that we
[1:19:40] work the more stones are taken out of
[1:19:43] our our lives and the better Our Lives
[1:19:46] go toward serving God and then instead
[1:19:49] of the wheat instead of the weeds
[1:19:53] choking out the wheat pretty
[1:19:56] soon the wheat will choke out the
[1:20:00] weeds and what does it
[1:20:02] produce remember this is the parable
[1:20:05] that we need to understand before we can
[1:20:08] understand anything else it produces
[1:20:13] Fruit by their fruits you shall know
[1:20:16] them the seed of the word didn't produce
[1:20:20] anything on the other ground the
[1:20:22] musicians can come and close that s
[1:20:25] sewed the seed it didn't produce
[1:20:27] anything on this hard
[1:20:29] ground and then in the Rocks yeah i'
[1:20:31] Sprout it up but it was worthless it
[1:20:32] didn't produce anything and then on the
[1:20:35] on the side of the of the
[1:20:38] field it was choked out by the
[1:20:41] weeds and it didn't produce any fruit
[1:20:44] but out in the field out in that good
[1:20:46] ground It produced something so I ask
[1:20:50] brothers and sisters here this
[1:20:52] morning why' you come
[1:20:55] why do you go to church why do you claim
[1:20:57] to be a Christian don't be
[1:21:02] secure and what you think that you are
[1:21:06] always examine
[1:21:08] yourself and look am am I this good
[1:21:12] field or am I staying up too late the
[1:21:15] night before am I doing things that I
[1:21:19] shouldn't and letting that those weeds
[1:21:22] grow with the good crop
[1:21:25] am I do I get
[1:21:28] offended and and as soon as as soon as
[1:21:30] something comes up as soon as the pastor
[1:21:32] says something or a deacon says
[1:21:33] something or somebody says something to
[1:21:34] me I'm out how many people come to
[1:21:37] church they come and
[1:21:40] visit and they say oh those people judge
[1:21:42] me because of the way I look those
[1:21:45] people judge me because of my tattoos
[1:21:47] those people judge me because of of of
[1:21:49] my background when it's
[1:21:52] them they're the ground that's not
[1:21:57] fertile but it's when they condition
[1:22:00] that soil and say you know what I got
[1:22:03] these things but I don't care I love the
[1:22:07] Lord I'm coming to church because I want
[1:22:09] to be a better person I'm coming to
[1:22:10] church because I want to live my life
[1:22:13] better and that Parable that the pastor
[1:22:15] talked about I understand
[1:22:18] that I want to be that good
[1:22:22] soil and now we lay this found
[1:22:24] foundation for the other Parables saying
[1:22:26] that there are different classes of
[1:22:28] people really there's
[1:22:31] two there's ones that accept the
[1:22:35] word and then there's ones that don't
[1:22:38] really
[1:22:39] care they say that they care but they
[1:22:42] care more about serving themselves than
[1:22:44] they do about serving
[1:22:46] God you with me you understand what I'm
[1:22:50] saying do you understand this Parable
[1:22:53] it's the most important we have to
[1:22:55] understand
[1:22:55] [Music]
[1:22:57] it you with
[1:22:59] me brother

[1:25:54] sister S I want to say
[1:25:55] [Music]
[1:25:57] this I um brother Jeremy baggot texted
[1:26:01] me I believe it
[1:26:04] yesterday and said one of the most
[1:26:06] profound things I was talking about
[1:26:08] wasting our
[1:26:09] time and Jeremy said he said they
[1:26:13] scroll all
[1:26:16] day rather than taking up the scroll and
[1:26:19] reading
[1:26:20] it I really appreciated that all of us
[1:26:25] have a weakness towards all of these
[1:26:27] different types of soil every one of us
[1:26:30] does just make sure that you're taking
[1:26:34] that soil like I did for that tree
[1:26:36] digging out all the kichi digging out
[1:26:38] all the rough stuff and mixing in that
[1:26:40] good fertile soil so that that seed has
[1:26:45] a chance to
[1:26:47] grow I told Daniel my son last
[1:26:51] night as I I said I believe that
[1:26:55] there might be somebody or people at the
[1:26:57] altar tomorrow
[1:26:59] morning and here's
[1:27:01] Heath right here saying Lord I need
[1:27:05] something Lord I
[1:27:08] need I want to be that good
[1:27:11] soil I want to be that sincere person
[1:27:14] that doesn't just come to church that
[1:27:16] doesn't just waste waste the Lord's
[1:27:19] time I want to be Lord what this Parable
[1:27:23] say say I should be and I want to
[1:27:26] understand it Lord and help me there's
[1:27:29] things in my life I need to get rid
[1:27:31] of there's things in my life I need to
[1:27:35] change the gospel is not a comfortable
[1:27:40] thing Jesus said it he quoted
[1:27:43] Isaiah and he said make their ears to
[1:27:46] where they can't
[1:27:48] hear he said make their minds to where
[1:27:51] they can't understand
[1:27:55] and then he goes back and he says now he
[1:27:56] that has an ear let him hear and let him
[1:28:00] understand these
[1:28:02] things bit of a
[1:28:04] paradox but I believe I one of those
[1:28:08] ones that do have ears to
[1:28:11] hear I believe I'm one of those ones
[1:28:13] who's willing to
[1:28:15] change this
[1:28:18] year I believe the Lord is doing
[1:28:20] something in my life I can't wait and I
[1:28:22] want him to do it in all of our Liv
[1:28:24] lives more consecration more
[1:28:28] word let those seeds go out and then now
[1:28:32] you start spreading those seeds and may
[1:28:34] they fall on good ground when we get
[1:28:36] under these different Parables there's
[1:28:38] they tell the same stories over and over
[1:28:40] and
[1:28:42] over Lord help us to
[1:28:44] understand it's not just that you say
[1:28:47] you believe
[1:28:48] it we must understand
[1:28:52] it we must understand understand it and
[1:28:55] be able to apply it to our
[1:28:58] lives let's all
[1:29:01] stand Open the Eyes of My Heart
