all the older folks in church but when you see the youth participating and it's so encouraging yes amen let's just bow our heads Lord this this evening and what is called the Easter season the Easter week the passion week Lord It's you we think about it we look into it we we wonder what it was like we have the scriptures we but ought to have been the and see it Lord ourselves but through your word tonight Lord just see what it was and what you did and why Lord and we want to love you for it and appreciate it so much tonight Lord Jesus so as we speak your word Lord Just Have Your Way in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may be seated God bless you brother Dan had asked me several weeks ago while taking that this first week or the week of Easter leading to Resurrection Sunday morning and I got nervous and I got it's such a it's it's what this book is written about right amen because without Easter without that Resurrection morning it's hopeless for us that's right amen but we know that Jesus even said father if if it's if it's your will could this cup pass from me but he said not my will but thy will be done show and this talking with brother Daniel and he and I said brother Daniel I can't teach like you and brother Lyall do and he said no just go ahead and preach it the way you do so we're able to say yes Lord and it's uh you have to go into eternity if I could say it that way to find where this was motivated from what God had started to be recorded in the scriptures but see in God uh brother Braham said he wasn't God because God is an object of worship anything that you worship that you spend your time you give your time for becomes a God in your life he said so and as there was nothing to worship him but there were attributes in him there was something that wanted to be expressed wanted to be displayed to be a avor to be a Healer to be all the things that he is and is and I can only think of it as I can think of it or as a song says if you could only imagine and and you begin to think what was it like let going ask brother Jordan to to play this quote as we get started from I am the resurrection and the life just a few minutes if he would do that the B if you just open up your mind that he was only a man I said do it by the Bible and I'll believe it she said when he went down to that resurrection of Lazarus said on his Ro down there he cried with the rest of the people the Bible said Jesus wept and that Pro that he was I said he might have cried that's true on his road down to need Lazarus he was human as far as human is concerned in his flesh he was human but in his Spirit he was God I said he cried that was a man crying he was a man when he was crying going down to Lazarus grave but when he stood there straighten that little frame up and said la come forth and a man had been dead 4 days come to life again that was more than a man that was B speaking to there hallah God was son that was God she can do Mar can do it Master believe Sal this he was a man when he got down that mountain that night come down and look all around that little fig tree there and he wasn't doesn't eat he was hungry he was a man when he was hungry but when he took five biscuits and two PES and fed 5,000 people that was more than a man that was God in the man Hallelujah he was the man when on back of that night when 10,000 devs of the sea SW they were drowning the little Storm come up the little B pitching like a father stoer out there on that Lake right that devil said we tonight he was so tired virt G out of him all day from preaching and healing he was so tired the stor didn't wak him up in the disciples bring he was a man laying there sleeping when he put his foot up on the Bri [Music] [Music] [Music] will provide himself a sacrifice and as I read that or as I was listening about the the message and I just saw that God will provide himself a sacrifice or God will provide himself a sacrifice amen he didn't say you're going to have to do it for yourself he said I will amen and then you have to see Christ in everyt scripture cuz this is about him from the front to the back and every page and it's it was God wanted to express himself brother Bram says he wasn't God he was God but there wasn't nothing else no worship so God is an object of worship and there was nothing to worship him so there was attributes in him to to be that to be a savior to be a Healer to be all the things that he is they were in him before time even began there was that but there was no way to express it and you know um I was thinking about that as as I was looking at that reading that and I began to think how as we grow up we begin to express we begin to a little child watching my grandchildren grow up as they they learn words and they begin and it's it's really neat now to as they're old enough to say Look Papa look how this is and they explain it to me how it is this does this and this does that you know and and as pape I look at him I'm go man you're so right you're so good at this you know and it it's it's just something it's pleasing and um you so here he is he was God but there was nobody to worship him so creation begins and in his mind he begins to see began to to express and we don't know how long it took but it began to work from the smallest whatever that is to the greatest to the biggest remember brother Mike yarboro uh doing a a lesson here from the smallest thing that man has found to the greatest things God from the beginning God to the end it's amazing he says and and you know as as he's creating as he's bringing forth and and and things are happening he's he is he is enjoying his creation it is good and he rested it is good and he rested you know it didn't mean he went to sleep he was at peace about what happen you can sleep and not rest but when there's peace there's rest and he says you know and and he says but but he's uh he he from the smallest to the biggest all the way to Adam and Eve if I could say the crowning of that creation somebody to talk with somebody to walk with somebody to come in the cool of the evening you know but in him was to be a savior wow in him was to be a Healer a comforter uh someone who could who could be touched by the feeling of your infirmities that was just he he wanted that to know that to feel that and and he says so so he had to create someone that could fall with a purpose they were going to fall he put the tree of of of life and good and evil and there he allows these things and I was thinking that even today about the animals there they were at peace they got along you know when the lion came by it wasn't run and hide you went over and sat you know they sat down if I in their language and talked to each other roamed around with each other it was amazing you know but all this time God knew there was going to be a fall everything was prepared for that he says someone to Fellowship knowing that they would fall and become mortal that would be an end to their life and and it is there had to be a sacrifice of life uh you know for the payment of sin is death Paul tells us that and and he tells them the day that you eat of this tree you shall surely die and not only did it change with Adam and evea changed the whole garden the animals didn't get along anymore everything began to go in a different direction when the lion used to lay down by the lamb the lamb became afraid of the Lion it all change it all turn he and you know as we see that and I'm just going over quickly because we could be here forever for this but the animal ha Behavior changes the the the seasons change everything begins to change you know and it's it's kind of like your life I'm looking back now and I remember those that would tell me just wait till you get my age he'll start changing things will change things happen this body is not Eternal but I have a promise of eternal life it says and we know that that there because he is a savior because he's a Healer because all of this um it Adam and Eve they they they they go out of the garden and and it shows they took leaves and covered themselves they they were embarrassed they were ashamed but botney life was not the accepted sacrifice Cain tried it he offered the best that he had all of his fruits and all but Abel offered the life of a lamb and the shed blood of a lamb speaking of something again you've got to find see Christ in every part of the book amen he was going to give himself you know lifespan goes from being an eternal creature to almost a thousand years all the way down to 70 to8 years and it didn't take long for that to happen when they broke God's word but it was all in God's plan he didn't have to go scrambling around say what am I going to do now what am I he's watching the Fulfillment of what is in his heart and is Desiring to do Isaiah 52:7 we we have a quite a few scriptures listen to this how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings that publishes peace that bringeth good tidings or Good Tidings of good that publishes salvation that saith unto say thy God reth can you imagine being there at a place with no hope and something calls out and says your God is alive he hasn't changed he's the same yesterday today and forever and something inside of you says amen I'm longing for that he says Isaiah that was Isaiah 52:7 Isaiah 17 7 14 these are all all um familiar script as many were astonished it's kind of hard to read it on as many were astonished at thee his Visage was so marred more than any man and his form more than the sons of men Isaiah now begins to say look look what's going to happen to this one now Isaiah was prophesying because he's a prophet but he probably couldn't explain that to you he probably couldn't tell you but it was that that that inspiration is coming and then you get Isaiah 9:6 For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace again Isaiah probably couldn't tell you what that was about that inspiration is coming out and this is all out of the book of Isaiah Isaiah 53 1 and2 describes what we're going to see in the future who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of the of dry ground he ha no form nor cless and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief he can be touched by the filling of our infirmities acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely Heath born our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him a stricken smint of God inflicted we looked at him and said well what did he do he must have deserved this God wouldn't do that to anybody unless unless they needed that that's what Isaiah is saying here but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement for our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed that hasn't changed it's still in full effect all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all looking to that day at Calvary he was oppressed he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep sheep before his Shear is dumb so he openeth not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the Wicked the King of Kings and the Lord of Lord is buried in a common grave wow look look what's happening in in England right now in London and all that's going on right now how what's going through with with with all the the the cancer and all that how it's spread out all over the whole world and everybody's looking at this yet the king of King and Lord of lords nobody knew and he he made his grave with the Wicked with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was there any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see the travail of his soul and he shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servants justify many for he shall bear their iniquities wow Mine yes Lord you bear you bore my iniquities and you know what iniquity is doing that which you know you shouldn't do and not doing that that you know you should do he bore it therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he ha poured out his soul unto death he was numbered with the transgressors and he bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors this was in Isaiah this was before this was happening and he had to say not my will but thy will be done so through all the Old Testament is speaking of a coming deliverer a coming savior every part of it all these sacrific IES we've been hearing about through through all the books that we've gone through all the the names and this it all talking about one aiming back towards one amen the king of king and the Lord of lords amen the Prince of Peace The Great I Am it's all speaking of that so as as we go there and and and we see it comes up and and we're going to skip all all the way from the Old Testament and go right into the New Testament now because a day came when God said it is time to get this going and John describes it this way in John 3:15 to1 17 that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for God so loved the world there was only one way God could express his love wow there had to be some way to express it to somehow but you know it's easy uh uh and this by experience it easy it's easy to express love back to somebody that's loving you it's easy to give something back to somebody's given you it's so much easier well they're my friends so but God is doing this because he is going to go and save and redeem and bring those who really shouldn't even have had a chance I sinned I came short of the glory of God I was a transgressor and he said I'll take your place he says for God so led the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved and if we're not careful Lord the only way I can please you is if I do this for you and if I do this for you and if I do this for God sent his son for you that's so good that's right but you know why you do that back for him because you love them yes amen because you want to please them but when you when you begin to offer that as the works like C did I'll offer my beautiful works and therefore you have to receive me no he's already receed received you he's already accepted the blood for you that's already done you know and and it's it's it's like and and it's okay because some of you may do this as a husband and wife do you still love me do you still love me do you still love me and we get reassurance that way you know and you know and and you know sometimes you you you kind of get feeling maybe it's been now with Mama came home today from we have she's home now and my wife is over there with her and you know and and we're missing one another we have but I know my dad was so happy today cuz Mom was home you know and and until you go through the some of those things do you realize how much you need that other one one another and you were part of him am and he's longing and desire to get you back oh wow that's what it is and he said what is it going to take to draw you back what is it going to take to get you back and he says there's not a righteous one there there's not one that can save themselves so I'll do it I'll step down and do it looking starting in Matthew and and Matthew Mark Luke and John is there's a lot of the the stories are just repeated at with a different view with a different you know but it they all saw that same thing they all heard the same thing they all witnessed they saw the fishes and the loaves they you know but each one had had a different view a different way so starting in Matthew chapter 1 looking at at some just kind of going through there we'll read some scriptures some of it we'll we'll just kind of God work now working to F fulfill the Old Testament Prophecies of the coming Redeemer the acceptable perfect Lamb of God the one that job cried out to I know my redeemer liveth and with these eyes I Shall Behold Him that one as you look through the Old Testament you start going down the line that cry that desire that that one brother brandham talking there and and you know with Adam with uh Abraham and Sarah and he's the knock at the door there and Jesus you know after his death and all and they're there and she said this is that one this is that one they've been looking for that and here he is 12 years old in the temple hearing because the Bible says he was listening hearing and asking questions you know and Mary tells them that they had been looking for him your father and I and he's anwers with I must be about my father's business I I I thought this interesting listen let's take that Matthew 1 19-23 the scripture there then Joseph her husband remember Mary had said be it unto me according to Thy word when the angel came and told her but Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately he says but while he thought of these things behold the the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee marry thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins Mary says be it unto me according to Thy word and Joseph's going how am I going to work with this how am I going to deal with this nobody's going to believe it they're going to say something happened that shouldn't have happened but at God rich in Mercy reaches down to Joseph and says take her I'm doing this I'm working this that same God that is rich in Mercy today would speak to you and say go ahead it's all right I'm in this you might be looking at your own life you might be looking what you've done and saying I'm not worthy but he said it's okay I've taken care of it it's taken care of you know it's the next so many chapters is him growing up Jesus Jesus learning um learning to say yes sir yes ma'am learning to be friendly learning how to live as a human would live how we should be living he didn't walk around and tell Mary you know what what the angel told you so you can't talk to me like that he subjected himself he learned if he was helping uh you know Joseph in and he banged his finger as a carpenter and Joseph said my goodness it doesn't even hurt him no he went like this too that's the only way he could be touched by the feeling of our infirmities to know what you're going through to understand that so so we know he's he's he's growing up he's he's he's going but things are happening that Mary and Joseph and and those that around him are seeing he is different you know he comes up and he says yes sir yes ma'am he comes he gets up and makes well I think he did he makes his bed in the morning you know he he does his chores you know and probably maybe upset his brother sometimes I don't know I I it's hard to imagine him not being that way you know I I don't to me he didn't talk back but but he he lived through that life you understand what I'm saying um and he comes up and and you know they they come to the time where where they're at that wedding and then they run out of wine and obviously they'd seen enough things and they knew enough things that happened they they go and they said Mary can you talk to Jesus about this situation how would they know if something hadn't happened before he was God in flesh and and these things are happening you're learning and you know as a Christian let me just say Christ in you things should be happening in your life that others are seeing amen and they can draw and they can receive and they can come up to you and say can you help me can you pray for me amen because you're expressing the the same God so now as we get up we see his life and he goes through and he calls his disciples as he's walking and it's amazing how he calls his disciples because he had he made sure they had gone to college they were properly trained they knew the right language no no he didn't do it that way huh a little experience when we were in the Pentecostal Church church just young people and and where we had come through in the Spanish side there was got to know some of the old the old Old Faithful ministers they had uh testimonies about them praying and Angels coming around them and these things that that we heard about we knew about raised with listening God was he was still the same yesterday Miracles and lives and all but as we got a little older and they began to to to send the the the ministers to the uh to school to be taught how to speak right how to do this right and I'm not against that it's a lot easier to listen to somebody that knows how to speak than somebody that doesn't I understand that but you began to see that it was no longer following a leadership of God or calling your life but rather how you were taught and trained wow but somebody that has met God for themselves and know he's real wow and he comes and talks to you and and or her whoever it is it's it's it's a daughter a son and daughter of God so here he is he's calling his disciples they're they're they're following him H uh you can read this through all four gospels or he goes many places and he heals the sick and and know we we know he feeds them feeds the the the whole crowd and there just so many things that he does but there is one goal and one aim that he's going to and that is to give his life so that you and I could be brought back I I imagine that yourself you know you're here on Earth and I'll Daniel I'll use you because you're up front imagine if if if it was you and they said Daniel when you become 25 years old you're going to have to give your life for this you could go out and do a lot of things but you'll never get that out of your mind this is he was called for something he was brought on this Earth for a reason and in all time is looking towards that He Could Be Touched By The Filling of our infirmities he went through many of cities and he said and he healed all the sick he reached out and he touched them he because that was God in flesh but there was still something that had to come and that was Redemption to bring us back so we get to something that I noticed um in all Matthew Mark Luke and John and we'll read it out of Matthew 20 17 and 19 I think 17- 19 that is and Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the 12 disciples apart in the way and said unto them behold we go to Jerusalem and the son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priest and unto the scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the Gentiles to Mock and to Scourge and to crucify him and the third day he shall rise again wow if they hadn't put that part that last line in there and then what they're going to do all of this and then what but he shall rise again so he tells them and if you go through and you read through that oh don't let this happen to you Lord don't let this oh no no that can't go they couldn't imagine being without him he took care of everything we owe some taxes well go down to the river there catch that fish he'll have the coin in his mouth go give it to him could you imagine that Lord I'm I'm running out of gas okay just you know go over here you know here he still takes care but this is what they lived with they were on a storm they were out in the boat in the storm and and and it it it starts rocking and they think they're going to die save us master here and he stands up on the bow and he says peace be still and the winds and the Seas obey him you know it still he still does that he's the same yesterday today and forever it's just imagine them seeing all this for about three years three and a half years it was watching him go and everything he touches and always wondering why don't the people accept him why don't they believe him look what he's done for us but when God comes a little different than what you think he should or how you have it planned out or how you figured it then you stop and say that can't be God but Lord just allow me to be sensitive and a humble Spirit to know it's you and let you direct so he says they're going to and and then we know now let me just tell you something here there was a a a really nice brother who we got to talking and I told him I don't know if I can do this and explain and he says I've got this this uh that I did a study on this week of Easter and he says I I'll send it to you thanks brother Dan I was looking at it he goes let me show you and and he did it for me or he let me use it um and so it's it it so I'm using a lot of the work that he did just cuz it was a a whole lot easier than trying to do it myself I I I I I really appreciate brother L and brother Dan in this this uh time of of the studying of the the books because my studying goes from here to there to here to here and there and theirs can go down the line and and that's how when you're going to do that is it's so much easier um but here here it is there there he just told them what's going to happen but let's go to Jerusalem okay Sunday there there are some unknowns like when when was the trial when did the scourging was it Thursday night or Friday morning and and which day did Mary wash his feet and and that's not really the most important thing but that it happened you know and and I sometimes how if you'll hear us my mom and dad and now me and my wife it was this no it wasn't it was that no it was this and and we spend more time arguing about who was right about when and what it was and that's not really the point it did happen that's so sometimes we can get caught up in all was it this John said it this way Matthew said it this way mark it was their perspective it's how they saw it you know so Mark 11 verses 1-10 and and when they came n to Jerusalem unto the Beth Beth and Bethany at the Mount of Olives he sendeth forth two of his disciples and saith unto them go your way into the village over against you and as soon as you be entered into it you shall find a cult tide where never a man sat loose him and bring him and if any man say unto you why you why do you this say ye that the Lord hath need of him and straightway he will send them hither has anybody ever tried that I need to borrow your card the Lord has need of it yeah that's interesting read that and lot time don't worry about it he knows he's expecting it it's going to happen you know that was the mode of transportation then you know if it would have been today he says brother Daniel just got a new truck go ask him if the the Lord can use it it's a little bit different today but that was a mode of transportation but that was fulfilling scripture yeah wow and God is going to make sure that every point of it is fulfilled in your life too and they went their way and imagined this and found the cult by the door without a place without in a place where the two ways met and they loose him and a certain of them that stood there said unto them what what do you loosing the cult and they said unto them even as Jesus had recommended and they let them go he never fails he never misses it he doesn't guess at it it's perfect every time sometimes he lets you learn that and ex what is it by experience you know learning it now it's it's something you can hold on to it's something you can believe for yourself not because the minister not because the prophet not because Mom or Daddy but because you met God and he answered it for you then it's real and they brought the cold to Jesus and cast their garments on him and he sat upon him and many spread their garments in the way and others cut down branches of the off the trees and straw them on the way and they that went before and they that followed cried saying hosana bless blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord blessed be the kingdom of Our Father David that cometh in the name of the Lord hosana in the highest and on the tomorrow when they were come from Bethany he was hungry he just has this triumphal entry he just has this wonderful time and he's hungry see that's how he can be a God that understands you yes that's how he can be touching by the feeling of what you have need of he was hungry and seeing a fig tree a far off having leaves he came if happily he might find anything thereon and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of the figs was not yet I I I still stopped there and I go but but Lord it it wasn't the season for figs I play this in my mind why did you have to do that it wasn't the Fig tree's fault it wasn't that time yet and Jesus answered and said unto it no man eat fruit of thee Hereafter forever and the disciples heard it and and you're going okay and they came to Jerusalem and Jesus went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the money chain ERS and the seats of them that sold doves and would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple and he taught saying unto him it is not is it not written that my house shall be called of all Nations the house of prayer and you have made it a den of Thieves and it hasn't changed and the scribes and the chief priests heard it and sought how they might destroy him for they feared him because all the people was astonished at his Doctrine and when even and when even was come he went out of this city it's amazing over the years as you you we've been you know I've been a Christian my whole life raised that way but when we heard this message it's been almost 50 years ago now and the separation and the the how do I want to say it you don't see it my way I don't want nothing to you here wrong wow we were we were we were I was at the swap meet one day a long time ago done the swap meet in years but um it was a brother that had stopped going to church and and and he saw me come over and talk to me and we got to talk and he said you still going to church there the Spanish Church said yeah we still attend there and all I said haven't seen you he says oh yeah he said I you know the church is a lodge and that's what just people look like and start telling so telling me how they they a church I said so what do you do he said well I'm the pastor of the group that meets at my house I said what's the difference between that the church and your house he just wanted to be a pastor of a group of people and you just but look at these things they they they were astonished they they they they wanted to destroy him because he was coming and he broke up and said this is a House of Prayer wow not a place for a denes and and we think of denes we know were selling they were doing this but if I would get up here and preach to you a false Doctrine and give you a false hope I'm a thief I'm stealing the peace and the joy of God from you and this is what he was talking about he said where God is there is peace even though he might correct you even though he might tell you this is wrong he's doing it for your good with a good intention with the right ending and that's that's just looking at some of these things here trying not to get ahead of myself here too much so that was Palm Sunday Monday he cursed the the fig tree walked into the temple we were just reading all this that happened there now on Tuesday and this is based on approximate When when is we don't know the exact days and and and but it was around that in that week the disciples noticed at the fig tree that Jesus had just cursed was withered um I don't know why this is so astonishing to them I would think they had seen quite a bit already but God can visit you now and a little while later and it's still amazing it's still wonderful it's still good you know I I pray that I would never get to a place in my life that I said okay Lord that's good enough I've had enough but a fresh touch every day they uh they notice that that it was cursed and it had to stay with them these were lessons they were learning along the way you know it's it's it's it's those things that we learn along the way some of us learn Le quicker than others some of us have to go find out if it's true if you hit your finger with a hammer does it really hurt they have to go find out they can't take your word for it but but here he is he's showing them I'm I I'm a I can speak to the creation I can create I can also take its life I can tell you go down to the fish and take out the money I can say peace be still in the storm but I also Can Be Touched by the fing of your infirmities I can be tired I need to lay down and rest too all sides of it and and then of course you know it's it's it's as he goes into the temple often and and he's he's talking with them and he's he's he's he's he's discussing the scripture and what Isaiah said and what this is and you know and it is if we're not careful sometimes well I know that already I'm learned I mean what can you teach me always say Lord I'm willing to hear more I'm willing to receive more I uh run into different people over time and and some of them uh there just wonderful people around the other ones if they don't show any attention they don't want to be that that's okay that's all right you know when when he's when he's speaking here he's uh he's talking about faith and and forgiveness and he's he's he's going through things in life about forgiving one another about caring for one another about loving one another how to treat one another you know there all these questions that they're asking him and and and you know they going to the scriptures and say this and you know he's looking past all of that and he's getting down into the heart and he's talking about getting these things right first getting this things right first we know that that that Young Rich ruler that comes up to him and talks with him and and he tells them well he said what must I do to to inherit eternal life you know uh and it's kind of what we got Lord what do I still have to do to inherit eternal life eternal life is yours you don't earn it you don't work for it God gave it to you but what you do is you love him for what he's done for you and you want to share with others and and you know he talks about he shows all of this through the scriptures so that you and I could understand this Mark 11 let's look at it Mark 1112 to 33 I believe it is here and on the marrow when they were come to Bethany he was hungry and seen a fig tree a far off having leaves he came as happily he might find anything there on and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of the FI was not and Jesus answered and said no man sh shall eat fruit of thee Hereafter and Ever After and his disciples heard it and they came to Jerusalem and Jesus went into the temple and began to cast out them that bought that bought and sold sold and bought at the temple and overthrew the tables of the money changers and the seed of them that sold doves and would not suffer that any man should carry in a vessel through the temple and he taught say him is it not written my house shall be be called of All Nation a House of Prayer you have made it a den of Thieves you and the scribes and the chief priests heard it and they sought how they might destroy him for they feared him because of all the people astonished at his Doctrine and when the even was come he went out of the city okay so so this just the the scripture um and then we get into as he was going through there we that was through 33 or maybe I gave you the wrong the mark 11:12 to 33 right okay and the Scribe and the chief priest heard in they s okay we have that all the way through 33 sorry that's what I wrote on my notes but maybe that's not what I uh and in the morning as they passed they saw the Fig Tree had dried up from the roots and Peter calling to remember and said unto him Master behold the Fig Tree which thou cursed is withered away and this is where I went and Jesus answered say unto him have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith he's talking to me and you if you can believe you know and and sometimes where where it gets hard for us to believe is we begin to look at ourselves and we begin to say am I worthy I failed here I did this wrong today I I was doing a homeowner appointment it was going to be the last one of the day and I had talked to my boss and said I'd like to get done as soon as possible to prepare for tonight and I had driven off the job it was on lcho and Lambert I had got on Tangerine I was headed into that was almost down to where the trial plant is right there and I get a phone call from my boss and he says um what did you just do with this last job and I said fix it well they're com they're complaining they're they're upset because it's wrong I go it's funny when I left everything was right and they were happy so he said get back there right out they've already called the the office of that Builder and the they're upset so I drive back there and and you know I'm thinking thank you Lord no I wasn't I was saying now okay what did I do I'm you know I'm going through all this stuff through my head what could happen you know they were so nice to me now they're mad you know and I'm just going down this line so I pull up and I was replacing a couple doors that were defective on their cabinets and I done it everything was fine when I get out there the 42-in tall door is half open and won't close but when I left we clothes are fine and he said good and I'm looking at it I'm going how did this happen his kids are about this big and they Wen up on the ladder I had the ladder with me and all but somehow one of the hinge just decided to break right about that time when I left it was a lesson for me go back and take care of the work it's okay we got it fixed he came back the hard part was he had called the customer service girl and and she called my boss and by the time the story got back to me the house was falling down yeah but replace the hinges they were happy and everything was fine and and these are things I believe Jesus was just talking to his disciples about if you say to this mountain be thou removed whatever that mountain is some mountains are this big and some mountains are bigger than the ceiling but if you say to this mountain wow whatever that situation is therefore I say unto you whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them and when you stand praying forgive why would he say that when you stand praying forgive he said if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive your trespasses the greatest evidence of you being and knowing you're forgiv by him is your attitude back to others can I forgive you know when I got back to the Mana yeah I was I wasn't all that happy about it I'm imagining all these things when I got there he's friendly and nice this like the third time I'd been in this house and we' had been fixing some odds and ends over the last few months and he was a really nice guy he's a fireman was off that day and and just really nice gentleman and and we fixed it and he was happy he was smiling you know he didn't throw me out of the house had that happen before but you know and and he says if you forgive you will be forgiven if my attitude going back to that house would have been a little less upset it wouldn't have been that long of a journey even though it was the same length whether my attitude was good or bad but how was my attitude and that sometimes affects that trip that time he says but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses and they come again to Jerusalem as he was walking in the temple and there come to in the chief priests and scribes and the elders and they say unto him by what Authority Dost thou these things and who gave thee this authority to do these things you know they still question you the same question by what Authority do you do this how can how can you stand and say he's Jesus Christ the same in yesterday and forever how can you stand up and say he's a Healer by what Authority by God's word and because he's been faithful to do it he says and Jesus answered and said unto them I will also ask you one question and answer me and I will tell you by what Authority I do these things the baptism of John was it from heaven or of men answer me and they looked at one another and said okay let's be careful how we answer this and they reason within themselves saying if we say from Heaven he will say why then did you not believe him but if we say of men they feared the people for all men connect um Can what's that word there because this is counted okay this is cut off there John that he was a prophet indeed and they answered and said unto Jesus we cannot tell and Jesus said unto him neither do I tell thee by what Authority I do these things in other words anyone embarrass themselves they didn't want to stand up and say you're right we're wrong and in my attitude I asked the Lord my attitude don't ever let me get that way I'm right and everybody else is wrong it's like the uh lady was driving down the road and her husband called her up and said honey be care okay I'm going to flip it around it's like the man some of the sisters are looking at me funny there's a man driving down the road and his wife calls him up and says honey be careful there's there's somebody driving down the road the wrong way and the man said ah honey there's a lot of people driving down the wrong way watch our attitude sometimes watch our attitude thank you okay I I'll be okay when I get home by neither do I tell you by what Authority do I do they shouldn't have even question here he is doing the works of God why are they questioning him now we look into here U on Wednesday Jesus was at the house of Simon a rich man Mary anoints him with oil you know that's one of the most to me it's it's one of the most amazing things here's God in flesh and a woman of ill Fame and it happens quite often with him because he's teaching us a lesson the scriptures are there for us to learn from to receive from it's not just a book to entertain us but for us to a a woman of ill Fame and and you know we know what what that was about and and and she comes and he she washes his feet with the tears of her eyes have you ever been so happy so grateful so or so broken in his presence that you just can't stop but cry I I was in praying here one day I was talking to brother Daniel about this one day praying here in one of the prayer meetings and and I asked the Lord I just asked him I saidd do you understand the feeling of being uh uh forsaken I just said you know and I I just cried out I said Lord and he just cried up back to did not I cry out my God my God why has Thou forsaken me he saw these people that felt that God had forsaken them and he knew what that feeling was and he could be touched by the feeling of that infirmity he let them come also to show here are these men who prided themselves in their religion and their dress and their acts and all and they couldn't humble themselves before God I I what would the people think of me wh what would they say wow you have to go and say I'm sorry yes you have to go before God and say I failed you yes but here he is showing even a person at that estate that would come and bow themselves before me can be forgiven can be cleansed whose names can be mentioned in the scriptures Mark chapter 14 1- 10 I don't want to be here too much longer so after two days was the Feast of the Passover and of unle bread and the chief priests and the scribes s how they might take him by Craft to put him to death but they said not on the feast day lest there be an uproar of the people and being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper as he said to me there came a woman leaving an alaster box of ointment of Spike Narda very precious and she break the box and P reported on his head and there were some of them that had indignation with themselves and said why was this waste of the ointment made to to imagine that here the king of kings and Lord of Lord someone is coming and sharing their heart and somebody's looking at it like this going what a waste of money for it might have been sold for more than 300 p and been given to the poor and they murmured against her and and Jesus said let her alone why trouble ye her she has wrought a good work on me for ye have the poor with you always and whensoever you will uh may do them good but me you have not always she has done what she could she has come beforehand to anoint my body for the bearing he knew why he was there that week he knew what was coming he also knew he was going to have to make a decision he was going to have to say not my will but thy will be done now the priests are really wanting to to um I think there was two more scriptures with that there maybe verily I say unto you whosoever wheresoever the gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world this also that she has done shall be spoken of her a memoral Memorial of her and Judas scariot one of the 12 went unto the chief priests to betray him unto them when your motive is money when your motive is to watch out watch where you can end up but somebody was called to do that somebody has to play the part somebody has to fit in that part and it's God's chosing and and if I I I I hear Brother Bram saying if he told me depart from me I never knew you I would say I love him too much to argue with him that's that that's hard to do also so we know here Judas has got this somebody had to betray him somebody had to turn him in somebody had to fulfill scripture and I didn't do the choosing you don't do the choosing God chooses but I would love to have that same spirit that same attitude that brother brandom had and that would take the spirit of Christ in me because that's what it was not my will but thy will be done he says so we know that he's he he's he's Judas is is is making that plans he said and they're trying to figure out they're and then they come and they gather themselves together in honor of the Passover Jesus washed their feet broke the unleaving bread with them and and to be there we have some of it recorded some of but just to be there can you imagine just being with the guy with the video camera or the whatever they do it with now and videoing this and recording what was going on in seen it all it'd be amazing to see you would get to see men be men and human and you would see a God that still loved them and be willing to talk to them and share with them and wash their feet when you wash your brother and sister's feet a after communion remember that he did that for you and he would say I'm doing it for one of yours Lord this this daughter or this son is yours he says and at this time Judas makes that that final decision to betray the Lord and and again somebody had to do it somebody had to fulfill that part of the scripture and Jesus told him to go and do and he went to the priest we know the payment how they set up he how are we going to know which when it is well I'm going to kiss him on the side he says and Jesus and his remaining disciples then go let's go over to I've got to kneel before my father and talk to him just stop for a minute and think about it you know that this weekend coming Friday Saturday Sunday you're going to take be taken before court and and they're going to try you and they're going to they're going to treat you as a common Thief maybe even worse has a murderer they let a murderer go instead imagine yourself and you could say to them Father forgive them they don't know what they do and again some of these things are reading is what brother Dan had wrote down in his study so I may owe him after this we call it good Friday but it was probably the worst day in history yet it was the best in history they took Jesus by force in Gethsemane we know that he had prayed father if it be thy will let this cup pass for me asks his disciples to pray with him and he gets up and they're asleep and he he wakes him up and he goes and prays some more and he get up and they're asleep again uh they just didn't really understand what was about to happen and finally he just says okay sleep you're going to need it you're about to go through one of the toughest times in your life also so they come after him with swords we we know this story you've read it all just so just quickly go through this and and they take him to the priest and everything is a false testimony a false witness against them made up stories accusations and all but see the one that was actually accusing through them is the one that's always been a liar so he can't tell the truth false accusations it said so when he's talking to you and telling you it's a false accusation you take God in his word that's a TR there's nothing false in that but he tells you oh that's not for you that's not you that's his Spirit even though the the Witnesses were proven wrong they insisted on killing him why because he was going to give his life somebody was going to do it we know they sent him to pilate to be judged and crucified pilate didn't find fault in him so he used a Jewish tradition of pardoning a criminal during the Passover and offered up Jesus to be pardoned instead of choosing they chose a murderer named barabus to be released if you look at what's going on today in in in the world news and everything how it has G gone from Christianity to be immoral to some of the sickest things happening out there and they would choose a murderer to be released over a just righteous man but had they chose him to be released and murdered barabus you and I would still be in our sins today wow we would have no hope but they they had to do what the scripture said Mark 15 1239 did I don't know if I gave you that he said and Jesus cried with a loud voice and gave up the ghost so now we know he's there he's going to be crucified all his disciples run uh Peter had just told him I'm not going to deny you it's not going to be I'm going to stand for you I'm going to be there and Jesus turned on say you're going to deny me three times and after the third time you're going to hear that rooster crow and you're going to know hey he looks like one of those that was with Jesus he dresses like them he looks like them he talks like them he quotes the scripture he quotes the message no I don't I you know and he began to began to began to began to he had to fulfill scripture too okay sometimes sometimes we find oursel in a situation just be honest with it and we don't exactly come out real real true real clean we we kind of hedge around a little bit make it you know you know sometimes it's just easy to say I was wrong sometimes it's hard so so all this is happening and now all his disciples disappear he's hanging on the cross this is what he had come for when he said not my will but thy will be done he said okay let's go do this and then he gave up he said he cried with a loud voice and gave up the ghost this was would be Mark 15: 37 3839 and Jesus cried with a loud voice and gave up The Ghost and the veil of the temple was rent in Twain From the top to the bottom there was now access to the Eternal one the one that only the high priest could go to once a year the one that you had to depend on him being accepted by God for you now you can go back right back into that holy of holies and talk to God yourself thank God Hey Brother Daniel can you go see the Lord today for me and brother Daniel says let me check my calendar I can't get in there till next sorry it'll be August before I can get in there for you you can go in yourself today amen he says and then the Centurion which stood over against him saw that he so he cried out and gave up the ghost He said truly this man was the son of God maybe it was a little too late I want to know him now not at the last moment we know that Joseph of Marthia asked pilate for the body which pilate gave him they laid Jesus in the Tomb and rolled a stole over over the opening if if these priests and all them had followed Jesus and watched Jesus and saw him turn the water into wine and saw him take the Loaves and and multiply them in the fish and why would they think a stone would keep him in I don't know so he was tried and crucified horrible day yet had a glorious day and today which is Saturday probably wasn't much better you know Friday Saturday things didn't look good the disciples had all run they had all spread they had all gone the very ones that were telling him we won't deny you I'll go with you and they're they're boasting of what they're going to do and he turns around he says you're going to deny me you're going to run you're going to hide Matthew 27 62 to 66 there now the next day that followed the day of preparation the chief priests and Pharisees came together and DEP pilot saying sir we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days I will rise again can you imagine they're saying it could happen we better make sure it doesn't you know we're looking at it from a different perspective altoe looking at it back this way and we know he's living and he's alive but just thinking about that command therefore that the Seer be made sure until the third day lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and say unto the people he is risen from the dead so the last error shall be worse than the first pilate said unto him you have a watch go your way and make sure make it as sure as you can so they went and made the separer sure sealing the stone and setting a watch so I want you guys to stay here and I don't want anything to happen okay you got to stay here you got to watch this thing for three days because he said he was coming out in three days so make sure it doesn't happen and then Sunday morning came and brother Dan will take it from there he's alive today he's the same yesterday today in for musicians come up he's the same yesterday today and forever he changes not that he would be willingly to go and suffer and take this and hurt and the bruise the the chastisement the false accusations the lies said about him and all he was stripped naked publicly and hung on a cross for you and for me I've asked brother Josiah if he would take this song Oh What A Savior let's stand let's just pray for him over here Lord it would take many many services to to really get into detail of these seven days but Lord we know that you were offered you offered yourself as that perfect lamb to save us for once and for all Lord Oh What A Savior and we love you for it thank you Lord Jesus [Music] once I was straying in sin's dark Valley no hope [Music] where I see they search through heaven and found a savior to save poor lost s like me oh what the [Music] Savior oh Hallelujah his heart was [Music] broken on calary his hands were nail scar his was he gave his life for even me he left the father with all his riches with calmness sweet said not my will and thy will be done from

his side was [Music] BR he gave his life to us for even me amen do you appreciate brother Aaron amen I appreciated our brother and and all that he said but one thing he said that was it was a little bit subtle and it just it just gave me a blessing he said when he was fixed in that cabinet he said he got it all installed and he got it fixed and then he left and he got a call to go back to the job and he turned around and brother Aaron said this he said he said it's okay just go back let me tell you something Jesus left 2,000 years ago but he's coming back and when he comes back he'll finish the job these sinful bodies will be be changed all will be made new at the at that time we'll go to a wedding supper there won't be any more suffering there won't be any more death it's going to be a great day and I believe that that day is coming soon I appreciate it brother and go through going through each day on Palm Sunday and then on Monday Jesus was walking along and he saw the Fig Tree he cursed it thing died and he went straight over into the temple he turned over the money [Music] changers I think uh I think somewhere it's written in the Bible that there is a time to speak and there's a time to be quiet it would have been a very good time to be quiet at that time when Jesus was walking by he cursed that fig tree and he went into the money changers that man meant business on that day and I just would have loved would have loved to been there see see what happened like brother Aaron said if you could if you could take a video of all of [Music] it but would I rather had a video or would I'd rather have all of these brothers different testimonies and their different perspectives I think one day brother Aaron I'm going to just ask each one of them to give me their testimony get John's take of it Matthew's take of it and Mary Magdalene and all of them it's going to be that's going to be a great day we got we got plenty of time brother Aon said we might have to stand in line for a while but it won't be any time there brother ml I'm going to bring the I'm going to bring the microphone down to you to close in [Music] prayer precious Heavenly Father we're grateful for this evening for your loving kindness to us we just thank you Lord that we can know you amen and have fellowship with you amen we thank you for this uh service tonight and for what's been said pray that you'll go with each one take them home safely and may they have a remainder of their week be blessed I ask your mercies on us all now in Jesus Christ's name amen brothers and sisters as I said at the beginning of service it's a very very very important week and if we could spend time in prayer this week go before the Lord ask that he would pour out his blessings upon those that need it on Sunday as I said there'll be visitors there's always visitors on Easter and there's always people that haven't maybe come to church all year but may they find something real and may they find it in every person in this congregation may they see the Holy Spirit just shine forth in love when they come in I pray that they would leave different people but brothers and sisters it won't happen unless we are praying unless we're going to the Lord for each other and will you will you take this week think about what brother Aaron brought to tonight and how each day marked a different thing that happened and then on Good Friday the crucifixion of our Lord and on Saturday must have been a really hard day but then as brother Aaron said but then there was a Resurrection on Sunday morning and may this Sunday morning be a resurrection of many people that have died in sin but may they die to themselves and then they may they be resurrected new people I'm going to ask you to do something don't take it haphazardly but I'm going to ask you if you will pray this week will you raise your hand before this congregation and before the Lord thank you brothers and sisters God bless you brother
