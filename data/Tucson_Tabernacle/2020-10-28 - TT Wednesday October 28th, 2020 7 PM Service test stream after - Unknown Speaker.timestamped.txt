[48:07] as we as you talked with us by the way
[48:11] thank you father trust in you in jesus
[48:14] name amen
[48:15] before you're seated let's turn to
[48:18] deuteronomy
[48:19] six and four and
[48:22] i was
[48:26] i was a little bit um
[48:29] wasn't totally prepared i got a
[48:33] the opportunities i'm happy for the
[48:35] opportunity to speak and
[48:37] always a privilege um i didn't know very
[48:40] long and so i'm
[48:41] i'm not totally prepared and so because
[48:43] of that i didn't get a list of
[48:44] scriptures to the brothers in the back
[48:46] and so we're just gonna uh go a little
[48:48] bit
[48:49] um whatever pace we need to go at and
[48:51] just we'll
[48:52] we'll uh enjoy what the lord has uh so
[48:55] my apologies though brother jeremy that
[48:57] i didn't get you those uh scriptures
[49:00] ahead of time but we'll look at
[49:02] deuteronomy
[49:05] 6 and we'll start in verse 4.
[49:09] it says hear o israel
[49:13] the lord our god is one lord
[49:16] and verse 5 says and thou shalt love the
[49:19] lord thy god
[49:21] with all thy heart and with all thy soul
[49:24] and with all thy might and one more
[49:27] scripture before you're seated let's
[49:29] turn to revelation
[49:30] the book of revelation chapter 3 and
[49:33] verses 14 to 16.
[49:51] okay verse
[49:54] 14 of the third chapter this is our
[49:57] letter amen
[49:59] the letter to us it says in verse 14
[50:03] and unto the angel of the church of the
[50:05] laodiceans
[50:06] write these things saith the amen the
[50:09] faithful and true witness the beginning
[50:11] of the creation of god
[50:13] i know thy works that thou art neither
[50:16] cold nor hot i would that thou work cold
[50:20] or hot
[50:22] so then because thou art lukewarm and
[50:24] neither cold nor hot
[50:26] i will spew thee out of my mouth
[50:30] and may lord add his blessings to the
[50:31] reading of his word let's uh be seated
[50:33] please
[50:35] well you can you can sit down and i'll
[50:37] stand how's that
[50:40] it's good to be in his house
[50:44] you know it got real cold all of a
[50:46] sudden
[50:48] and just went from being 100 degrees and
[50:52] a couple days now
[50:53] i'm just shivering away and so i got
[50:57] got thinking about the cold and and so
[50:59] this is kind of the
[51:02] the thought that came to me is the
[51:05] spiritual coldness
[51:07] and this is something that we're really
[51:09] familiar with
[51:10] we've heard this many times this
[51:13] admonition to the church of the
[51:14] laodiceans
[51:16] that we uh we should not to be lukewarm
[51:19] the lord would rather us to be cold or
[51:21] hot and
[51:23] hot would be the best but
[51:26] even cold he can work with us but this
[51:28] lukewarm is something that we know is
[51:30] a very dangerous place and the condition
[51:33] of this age
[51:34] and so i know that that's very uh
[51:36] familiar to you
[51:37] but let's just take a little bit of time
[51:40] to to look into the word and
[51:42] and just look every time you look at it
[51:43] he can show you something new
[51:45] and he can he can speak straight to your
[51:47] heart even though i'm totally oblivious
[51:50] to it he can he can open something to
[51:52] you that you never saw before or maybe
[51:53] you saw before and you forgot
[51:56] and he can just speak right to you so
[51:58] let's
[51:59] let's just look at this little bit it
[52:01] says there
[52:05] i know thy works that thou are neither
[52:09] cold nor hot
[52:10] i would that that were cold or hot and
[52:13] this is
[52:16] you know this is talking about a
[52:20] spiritual temperature
[52:23] what's your the first thing you do
[52:25] generally when you go to the doctor
[52:26] one of the first things they do i guess
[52:29] first they got to get you through the
[52:30] paperwork so they can get their money
[52:31] for it but after they get all that
[52:33] squared away
[52:34] you know they take your temperature see
[52:36] how you're doing let's let's
[52:38] let's see what's going on here and so we
[52:40] can look at the
[52:41] the temperature here and so we want to
[52:44] see well what what is this
[52:47] temperature referring to and so we
[52:50] we kind of have an idea of of what this
[52:53] means and
[52:55] i think the idea is definitely part of
[52:57] it that it's easy to um envision
[53:00] somebody that is cold and full
[53:04] and you can think of kind of a
[53:08] you know a big formal catholic church or
[53:11] something like that with no emotion
[53:13] and just really cold and
[53:16] somber and so that's a part of it and
[53:19] you can easily think of kind of our
[53:21] natural opposite to that
[53:23] is somebody that's on fire for the lord
[53:26] and somebody that's
[53:27] just jumping and enthusiastic and amen
[53:30] and praise the lord and that's part of
[53:33] it we
[53:34] we uh we don't have to be statues in
[53:37] here
[53:38] we can be we can be living saints moving
[53:41] saints
[53:42] but you know if it just comes down to
[53:44] being able to make some noise and shake
[53:47] it up a little bit
[53:48] well then uh you know we've got no
[53:50] chance against the pentecostals or
[53:52] or a lot of these other ones you know
[53:54] they they'd run circles around us and
[53:57] you know part of that we've got to be
[53:59] careful because
[54:00] you know part of that maybe is to our
[54:01] shame
[54:03] but there's another aspect to it um
[54:07] there's a there's a quote that brother
[54:10] branham
[54:11] speaks in uh this world is
[54:15] falling apart and he says
[54:18] what church is he coming to the church
[54:21] that we're living in the laodicean
[54:22] church age
[54:24] the last church age with lukewarm just
[54:27] enough to dance around
[54:29] and say i got it i spoke in tongues i
[54:32] shouted hallelujah i got it so when he's
[54:35] talking about the lukewarm church he's
[54:37] actually talking about
[54:38] the pentecostal church that says i
[54:41] shouted i spoke in tongues and i got it
[54:43] he's actually talking about them not
[54:45] necessarily the cold former catholics
[54:47] but these ones that are saying i shouted
[54:50] i got it but listen
[54:51] he says and come back in our church is
[54:55] look like a bunch of jezebels
[54:58] see they've got the they've got the
[55:01] dancing
[55:02] they've got the speaking in tongues
[55:05] then they're not lining up with this
[55:10] see it says uh look like a bunch of
[55:12] jezebels look like
[55:14] a bunch of i don't know what corruption
[55:17] remember
[55:18] your outside expresses your inside
[55:21] no matter how much your testimony is
[55:24] your life speaks louder than your words
[55:27] oh and so just want to go a little bit
[55:30] deeper than the superficial
[55:33] of you know how loud can you amen and
[55:35] how
[55:37] how much of a christian you look on
[55:38] sundays but when the lord
[55:41] would take your spiritual temperature
[55:44] you know are you hot are you cold are
[55:46] you lukewarm where are you
[55:48] it really goes deeper than that and it
[55:51] goes down to
[55:55] to be hot is to line up with this word
[55:59] to be cold you might be jumping and
[56:02] shouting and speaking in tongues
[56:03] but if you're not lining up with this
[56:05] word of god
[56:07] then spiritually you're cold or even
[56:09] dead
[56:10] and then in between you've got the
[56:14] dangerous case
[56:17] where on your outside you know you may
[56:18] be one way or the other
[56:20] but the dangerous case is where when you
[56:24] take your temperature by the word
[56:26] look at your life through the word
[56:28] you're not
[56:29] totally just flat out disobeying
[56:32] everything
[56:33] you're not that cold
[56:36] but you're not hot you're kind of right
[56:38] in that middle that
[56:40] well i can i can get about 70 of it
[56:42] that's a c
[56:43] and c's earned degrees you know but
[56:47] the lord said i would that you were hot
[56:49] and if he if he's got that desire for us
[56:52] if he's if that's how he's encouraging
[56:54] us and calling us he's made a way for us
[56:56] to be there
[56:58] see that word there
[57:01] when it says hot it's not just kind of
[57:04] like
[57:05] you know a little bit better than
[57:07] lukewarm
[57:08] but that word hot if you look it up it's
[57:11] it's boiling hot
[57:14] it's gone all the way up as hot as water
[57:16] can go
[57:17] and then it's getting to the place that
[57:19] there's a phase transformation
[57:22] there's some not a not a chemical
[57:24] reaction but there's a
[57:25] there's a transition here things are
[57:28] going from
[57:29] something that's stuck in a bowl
[57:31] something that can fill a room
[57:34] there's there's something there
[57:35] something critical it's gone as far
[57:38] as it can go as a water and it's it's
[57:40] changing
[57:42] and see that's that's how we're called
[57:44] to live is not just in a lukewarm
[57:47] obedience to this word
[57:50] not just these varying degrees of
[57:52] sanctification
[57:54] but to live in the land the promised
[57:56] land of the holy ghost
[57:58] where you're totally you don't even look
[58:00] like water anymore
[58:02] you can't even really see steam but it's
[58:05] there it's
[58:07] it's it's out of its own rapture
[58:10] and that's that's what we're called to
[58:11] be not just you know a little bit hotter
[58:13] than
[58:14] than the pentecostals or the baptists or
[58:16] whatever we've got a little bit more we
[58:18] we follow a couple of extra scriptures
[58:21] we uh you know we do a little bit better
[58:23] at the not cutting the hair
[58:24] and that it's not that but are we
[58:27] boiling hot
[58:28] are we in complete obedience to this
[58:31] word of god this love letter that's
[58:33] written to us that's calling us up
[58:34] higher
[58:36] it's saying i'm not calling you
[58:39] to live this lukewarmness but i'm
[58:42] calling you to be
[58:43] just a boiling hot church spiritually
[58:47] and see once you once you look at it
[58:50] that way
[58:51] you know can i can i give my all
[58:54] to this jesus this living word
[58:58] just focus on that and then the
[59:01] the singing the dancing the shouting
[59:03] speaking in tongues that'll take care of
[59:05] itself
[59:06] see if you just focus if you try to
[59:08] chase that
[59:09] try to chase the shouting and the
[59:11] dancing and everything you'll get it
[59:17] but you might still be lukewarm you
[59:18] might be cold
[59:20] but if you'll pursue this
[59:24] this living word this love letter
[59:28] this that we've heard if you'll just
[59:30] surrender to it submit
[59:32] to it then just watch the gifts of the
[59:35] spirit start moving in the church
[59:37] you believe that see we're looking for
[59:40] these things we're not that's not for a
[59:41] different age
[59:42] but that that dynamic power that's for
[59:45] us
[59:48] and we'll i believe that we'll see that
[59:51] if we'll just keep our eyes on christ
[59:53] not look to these waves that are going
[59:56] all the way around
[59:57] up and down in elections and coronavirus
[1:00:00] and
[1:00:01] pandemic all this different things but
[1:00:04] just keep your eyes on the word
[1:00:06] just keep it right there you'll walk on
[1:00:10] the water
[1:00:12] see
[1:00:15] one thing about water boiling
[1:00:18] the higher you go in elevation the
[1:00:20] easier it is to boil
[1:00:22] so let's just keep on walking up up that
[1:00:25] road to glory
[1:00:27] get a little more elevation get a little
[1:00:28] closer to boiling
[1:00:31] will be changed the other thing about
[1:00:33] boiling water
[1:00:36] cleans all the trash out you could take
[1:00:39] nasty dirty deadly water
[1:00:43] just boil it it'll kill all the germs
[1:00:47] it'll go from liquid to gas and leave
[1:00:50] all the trash behind and then you can
[1:00:51] condense it
[1:00:52] and get pure distilled water that's what
[1:00:55] our lives ought to be
[1:00:57] so you won't you won't get that
[1:01:00] if you just get a little hotter if i
[1:01:03] take some
[1:01:04] you know sewage runoff or some nasty
[1:01:06] water like that
[1:01:08] i said well i i heated it up uh
[1:01:11] you know 120 degrees 150
[1:01:15] you want some it's pretty warm
[1:01:18] no way to see if you'll take whatever
[1:01:20] dirty water and you'll
[1:01:21] boil it you can get crystal clean pure
[1:01:24] water
[1:01:26] that's what our lives need to be there's
[1:01:28] there's a big difference between being
[1:01:30] totally surrendered
[1:01:34] to being a little bit warmer
[1:01:38] there's a world of difference there so
[1:01:40] let's just look into the word and see
[1:01:43] see what this is about one thing
[1:01:46] let's just leave that up there one thing
[1:01:49] you'll notice
[1:01:49] is that it says i know thy works
[1:01:54] that they aren't neither cold nor hot
[1:01:56] see it's not
[1:01:57] it's not saying that he knows your your
[1:02:00] song
[1:02:01] or your your demeanor how you look
[1:02:04] it doesn't even say i know your heart
[1:02:06] see a lot of times we say well it's just
[1:02:08] in the heart
[1:02:09] and so you know my my my heart is right
[1:02:13] with god and that's all that matters
[1:02:15] but he doesn't even say i know your
[1:02:17] heart that's colder i thought
[1:02:19] he says i know your works because your
[1:02:21] works will declare what your heart
[1:02:23] really is
[1:02:24] and the heart is deceitfully wicked who
[1:02:26] can know it
[1:02:28] and so if you try to look at your heart
[1:02:30] you can end up fooling yourselves but
[1:02:31] what the lord is saying here your works
[1:02:35] will declare
[1:02:36] see your works are are they
[1:02:41] are they judged by the word to line up
[1:02:44] or do your works show that we've cooled
[1:02:47] off a little bit
[1:02:49] that we've lost our first love a little
[1:02:51] bit and we need to
[1:02:53] need some help i need a lot of help but
[1:02:56] he's
[1:02:57] he's faithful faithful is he that
[1:02:59] started the work
[1:03:00] to finish it the same one that lit that
[1:03:04] fire underneath my pot of water
[1:03:07] he's faithful to take it to boiling and
[1:03:10] see i might
[1:03:12] i might uh run around and mess things up
[1:03:16] slow things down but if he's determined
[1:03:20] that i'm going to boil
[1:03:23] nothing can separate us from that love
[1:03:25] of god
[1:03:27] and it says no creature
[1:03:30] i look a lot like a creature sometimes
[1:03:32] but i guess i fall into that that
[1:03:34] not even myself can separate
[1:03:38] that seed of god that he placed in me
[1:03:41] from his great love that he purposed in
[1:03:43] the beginning
[1:03:44] amen so he's looking
[1:03:48] at our works to see what our temperature
[1:03:50] is
[1:03:51] um so
[1:03:55] we're looking here at uh you know we're
[1:03:58] looking a little deeper than the emotion
[1:04:00] but at the same time we uh we want to be
[1:04:03] emotion uh we want to be
[1:04:05] zealous i think i thought of in the
[1:04:08] old testament where that was there was
[1:04:10] that king and the prophet
[1:04:12] said you know take these arrows and
[1:04:13] smite the ground
[1:04:15] and he he just smote the ground a couple
[1:04:17] times
[1:04:18] and the prophet rebuked him and said you
[1:04:21] know if you'd taken that and you
[1:04:22] you'd really done it with all your heart
[1:04:26] you would have utterly destroyed the
[1:04:28] enemy because you did it three times
[1:04:29] you'll defeat them only three times
[1:04:31] and so i don't want to you know you've
[1:04:33] got to keep your balance in the word
[1:04:35] and i don't want to say it's all just
[1:04:37] doctrinal and
[1:04:39] it's all just about you know how you
[1:04:42] align with the word because there is a
[1:04:44] component of this that is talking about
[1:04:46] zeal and we know that the word teaches
[1:04:49] us that whatever your hand finds to do
[1:04:50] you should do it with all your heart
[1:04:52] and so don't let me suggest that this is
[1:04:54] uh saying that you can be
[1:04:56] on fire for god and and uh it'd be
[1:04:59] totally
[1:05:00] uh just um an inward thing it's not a
[1:05:04] not just an inward thing it'll it'll
[1:05:06] manifest on the outside
[1:05:08] and we ought to have a zeal for the
[1:05:10] house of the lord
[1:05:12] but um
[1:05:16] we know that the word talks about
[1:05:21] the love of many waxing cold
[1:05:25] and so your works and your love
[1:05:28] they're kind of related because there's
[1:05:31] kind of a chain here
[1:05:33] but your works are your faith expressed
[1:05:36] right
[1:05:38] and your faith works by love
[1:05:42] so in the line here there's love
[1:05:46] there's faith and there's works and so
[1:05:49] your
[1:05:50] your works are your faith expressed
[1:05:54] and your faith works by love and so you
[1:05:56] can see that if your love
[1:05:58] is to grow cold as the word talks about
[1:06:03] then your works will no longer align
[1:06:06] with the word of god because of that in
[1:06:08] between
[1:06:08] that your faith will decrease and we
[1:06:11] know that everything in this age the
[1:06:12] the devil's plan we know is is just
[1:06:16] aimed at your faith to get you to
[1:06:18] disbelieve the word of god
[1:06:20] to get you to disbelieve that his
[1:06:22] promises are true
[1:06:24] and not just that they're true but
[1:06:25] they're for you that they're not just
[1:06:27] for the person
[1:06:29] in the pew next to you but that this is
[1:06:31] a personal letter that he wrote to you
[1:06:33] personal promises that he's made to you
[1:06:36] as his child
[1:06:38] and so we know that that's the the focus
[1:06:41] of the enemy
[1:06:43] is to destroy that faith
[1:06:46] that link between your love and your
[1:06:48] works
[1:06:50] and because it then he'll get you in a
[1:06:52] spiral that once your
[1:06:54] once your faith fails your works fail
[1:06:59] then you get caught up looking at that
[1:07:03] you stop thinking about the promises of
[1:07:05] god you stop thinking about the goodness
[1:07:06] of god all you see is your
[1:07:08] fallen faith in your fallen works and
[1:07:10] when you're looking at that your love
[1:07:12] gets even colder
[1:07:14] see he gets you looking at that failure
[1:07:17] and then it gets into this vicious cycle
[1:07:19] where everything's just coming down
[1:07:22] coming down
[1:07:24] see but we've got a promise that in this
[1:07:28] day we'd be restored back to the faith
[1:07:30] of the fathers and that was a perfect
[1:07:31] faith
[1:07:33] see praise the lord
[1:07:37] let's read that in matthew 24 12.
[1:07:42] where it says the the faith of many
[1:07:46] we wax cold
[1:07:57] matthew 24 and
[1:08:00] verse 12.
[1:08:04] this is talking about the last
[1:08:07] um you know the the signs of the times
[1:08:10] this is the portion where
[1:08:12] the disciples are saying what is the
[1:08:14] sign of your coming and at the end of
[1:08:15] the world
[1:08:16] and this is where jesus is talking about
[1:08:18] nations rising against nations and
[1:08:20] and all these things uh false prophets
[1:08:23] rising and deceiving money
[1:08:25] and then in verse 12 he says and because
[1:08:29] iniquity will abound the love of many
[1:08:34] shall wax cold
[1:08:37] it says in verse 13 though but he that
[1:08:40] shall endure unto the end the same shall
[1:08:42] be saved
[1:08:44] so we can see that there's this time
[1:08:48] that we're living in that iniquity
[1:08:52] is going to be just cooling down the
[1:08:55] love
[1:08:56] that's what i wanted to talk about today
[1:08:59] is just
[1:09:00] a little title cold love
[1:09:04] that's what's causing the the works of
[1:09:06] this layer to see in church
[1:09:09] to be lukewarm is because this
[1:09:12] iniquity this sin this unbelief that's
[1:09:16] in the land
[1:09:19] is causing the love of many to wax cold
[1:09:25] it's just like
[1:09:29] when you're you might be on
[1:09:32] you might be nice and warm and then you
[1:09:34] go out into a blizzard
[1:09:37] you fall in some water and you know you
[1:09:39] were nice and warm but it doesn't take
[1:09:41] long for those surroundings
[1:09:43] to affect your internal temperature see
[1:09:46] temperature is
[1:09:48] contagious just like the coronavirus
[1:09:51] temperature
[1:09:52] doesn't keep to itself but if you bring
[1:09:54] two things together that are different
[1:09:55] temperatures
[1:09:57] the temperatures are both going to
[1:09:58] change the hot one's going to get colder
[1:10:01] the cold one's gonna get hotter
[1:10:02] and eventually if you keep them together
[1:10:04] they'll meet in the middle
[1:10:06] and so if we were just to be
[1:10:09] [Music]
[1:10:11] heated up one time even to boiling
[1:10:14] and then you were to take and put
[1:10:16] yourself in this
[1:10:18] age full of iniquity
[1:10:21] and if you're just to leave that there
[1:10:25] just sit yourself here
[1:10:28] left left to the natural progression of
[1:10:31] the way the laws of nature work
[1:10:35] you would eventually come and be your
[1:10:38] your temperature difference would be
[1:10:39] totally neutralized
[1:10:41] you would come just to an equilibrium
[1:10:44] that there would be
[1:10:45] that would just keep sucking the
[1:10:47] temperature out of you
[1:10:49] until you were the same temperature as
[1:10:50] the world if
[1:10:52] if all that it was is that you are
[1:10:54] heated once
[1:10:55] and uh and put there
[1:10:59] but i'm so glad that that's not
[1:11:03] the way that the lord has designed our
[1:11:05] body to work
[1:11:06] we're not something that's just heated
[1:11:08] once
[1:11:10] but we're on fire we've got a living
[1:11:13] burning
[1:11:14] holy ghost inside the church inside each
[1:11:17] believer
[1:11:18] and that's not just a hot temperature
[1:11:21] but that's a
[1:11:22] energy provider that's something that
[1:11:25] the
[1:11:26] the devil can't put out see there's
[1:11:28] there's two kinds of creatures in this
[1:11:30] world really
[1:11:32] there's cold-blooded and warm-blooded
[1:11:36] there's there's the reptiles and the
[1:11:38] snakes and the creepy crawlies
[1:11:40] that if their surroundings are cold
[1:11:43] their internal temperature will be cold
[1:11:45] also
[1:11:46] if you take a snake or a lizard or
[1:11:48] whatever and put them
[1:11:50] somewhere cold there's nothing they can
[1:11:52] do about it they're just going to slow
[1:11:53] down
[1:11:55] not going to have many works
[1:11:59] and that's what the devil wishes we were
[1:12:00] like
[1:12:02] because if he could just get us to just
[1:12:03] absorb this iniquity
[1:12:05] that's blanketing this age
[1:12:09] our love would grow cold
[1:12:13] but the lord also designed in his
[1:12:15] goodness and his grace
[1:12:18] creatures that can generate their own
[1:12:21] heat
[1:12:23] but i can take some nutrients i can take
[1:12:26] a sandwich or a steak or something like
[1:12:28] that
[1:12:29] and i can eat it and by the processes
[1:12:31] that the lord has designed inside of me
[1:12:34] i can be in a snow bank i can be in a
[1:12:38] cold river
[1:12:40] and i can still be generating heat and
[1:12:42] and still be warm you have people that
[1:12:43] will go and
[1:12:44] and take an ice bath or something like
[1:12:46] that and they don't freeze but they're
[1:12:48] they're triumphant over it see
[1:12:52] and now this one's going to sound a
[1:12:54] little bit
[1:12:56] different but stay with me
[1:13:00] there's another way to stay warm
[1:13:03] and that's to get really drunk
[1:13:08] there's a there's a man this is a true
[1:13:11] story
[1:13:12] one of the survivors of the titanic
[1:13:15] which
[1:13:15] the titanic went down and they said the
[1:13:18] water was about 28 degrees so below
[1:13:20] freezing
[1:13:21] just frigidly cold icebergs and
[1:13:24] everybody it was so cold that some of
[1:13:25] the older people that would
[1:13:27] end up in the water their heart would
[1:13:28] just stop right away
[1:13:30] just give them a heart attack and just
[1:13:32] kind of like this age
[1:13:34] so cold with iniquity it it could just
[1:13:37] stop your heart
[1:13:39] right away just so bad and so all these
[1:13:42] people a lot of them that
[1:13:43] ended up in the water when the ship went
[1:13:45] down it wasn't so much that they were
[1:13:46] drowning
[1:13:47] but it was that brutal cold that was
[1:13:49] just destroying them and
[1:13:52] you know 15 minutes you could end up
[1:13:53] dead
[1:13:55] but there was one man and
[1:13:58] he probably never guessed when he did
[1:14:00] this that he'd end up in a sermon
[1:14:02] but he decided when the ship was going
[1:14:04] down he was just gonna get good and
[1:14:05] drunk
[1:14:06] and he got good and drunk and he stayed
[1:14:09] on the boat and the boat went down and
[1:14:10] he just kind of stepped off at the end
[1:14:13] and he says that he survived two hours
[1:14:18] because he was just so full of this this
[1:14:21] drink inside him
[1:14:26] see and it sounds kind of ridiculous
[1:14:30] but we ought to be drunk with the spirit
[1:14:34] of god
[1:14:36] we're supposed to be undigging
[1:14:38] undignified
[1:14:40] we don't we don't care that the ships of
[1:14:44] the world
[1:14:45] this country whatever is going down
[1:14:48] we're not concerned with that
[1:14:50] we're not concerned with the temperature
[1:14:51] of the water
[1:14:54] but we've got we're just drunk on the
[1:14:57] spirit of god
[1:15:01] that that just calms our nerves they
[1:15:03] said that's the trick to it
[1:15:05] how that this man was probably able to
[1:15:07] survive
[1:15:09] is that everyone else that went into the
[1:15:11] water they're all
[1:15:12] flailing they're panicking and what
[1:15:15] that's doing is distributing the heat
[1:15:16] really quick
[1:15:17] they're getting a lot of cold water all
[1:15:19] over each limb
[1:15:20] but see this man
[1:15:24] he was just satisfied and calm
[1:15:27] with this that he'd been drinking and so
[1:15:30] when he went in
[1:15:32] he just was kind of bobbing around
[1:15:36] he just weathered the the cold and
[1:15:38] everything that pulled him out
[1:15:40] and um you know
[1:15:44] a very absurd example but let me read
[1:15:47] you a quote just so you don't throw me
[1:15:49] out of here
[1:15:51] okay this is from an exodus
[1:15:57] it says notice and when they were all
[1:15:59] eating that manna
[1:16:01] they got drunk just as drunk as they
[1:16:03] could be and were staggering like drunk
[1:16:04] men and listen my catholic friend the
[1:16:07] virgin mary was with them
[1:16:09] and she had to get that before she
[1:16:10] entered heaven how much more are you
[1:16:12] gonna have to get that
[1:16:14] that's right you know what the trouble
[1:16:17] today the reason we're so allergic to
[1:16:18] many
[1:16:19] things we don't get drunk enough you
[1:16:21] believe that
[1:16:23] i believe it was william booth cleveland
[1:16:24] one day said in the early salvation army
[1:16:27] days of england
[1:16:28] he missed his train one night he had to
[1:16:30] walk up and down the streets and he
[1:16:31] walked with a cop
[1:16:33] been raining an old drunk was laying in
[1:16:35] the street just as drunk and froze the
[1:16:37] street
[1:16:39] and he said to call the paddy bag and he
[1:16:40] came picked up the drunk and pushed him
[1:16:42] out of there
[1:16:42] he said what will you do to him why i
[1:16:44] said we'll just take him down and throw
[1:16:46] him in the jug
[1:16:47] he said well what just aren't you going
[1:16:49] to take care of him
[1:16:50] said he don't need no help why the man
[1:16:53] why i said the man will take
[1:16:54] pneumonia he said i guess if you took
[1:16:57] him to the salvation army you'd pat him
[1:16:58] up a little warm him up and give him hot
[1:17:00] coffee in a hot bath all those things
[1:17:02] he said sure that's the reason you'd
[1:17:04] kill him he said you know what
[1:17:06] the people don't understand but the man
[1:17:08] so drunk
[1:17:09] every pore of his skin is filled with
[1:17:11] whiskey
[1:17:12] said they can't no cold get into him
[1:17:16] and the bible said be not drunk upon
[1:17:19] strong drinks
[1:17:20] which is to excess but be drunk on the
[1:17:22] spirit
[1:17:25] what's the matter today we ought to get
[1:17:26] so drunk
[1:17:28] till our carcasses would be so full of
[1:17:31] the holy ghost
[1:17:33] that nothing else could perch in the way
[1:17:36] the trouble is in trouble that is that
[1:17:39] we don't get a good old-fashioned
[1:17:41] pentecostal drunk amen that's right
[1:17:45] so i hope you'll forgive me for that
[1:17:48] that's titanic story but
[1:17:52] if we're drunk on the spirit of god this
[1:17:55] iniquity that's around
[1:17:56] the ship that's going down
[1:18:00] we can still have a fire inside it won't
[1:18:02] be the fire or whiskey but it'll be the
[1:18:04] fire of the holy ghost
[1:18:11] so we want to look at the love of many
[1:18:15] is waxing cold because of iniquity
[1:18:20] well this iniquity is sin or
[1:18:21] disobedience
[1:18:23] so we want to look and see have we been
[1:18:26] affected by this
[1:18:28] spirit of iniquity in this age so we
[1:18:31] could go through and we could look at
[1:18:32] the different commandments we could
[1:18:33] evaluate our spiritual temperature
[1:18:36] but let's just take one exodus
[1:18:40] 20 and verses one to three we'll just
[1:18:43] we don't have time to go through all the
[1:18:45] commandments but let's just take a
[1:18:47] temperature
[1:18:48] here really quick
[1:18:57] exodus 20
[1:19:00] verse 1
[1:19:04] and god spake all these words
[1:19:07] saying i am the lord thy god which have
[1:19:10] brought thee
[1:19:11] out of the land of egypt and out of the
[1:19:13] house of bondage
[1:19:16] now here's the first i shall have no
[1:19:18] other gods before me
[1:19:21] see that's that's the first of the ten
[1:19:23] commandments we learned that as a
[1:19:25] as children we got our ten dollar bill
[1:19:28] from brother green when he was giving
[1:19:30] those out
[1:19:31] say we're way past that
[1:19:35] this one this one's an easy one to
[1:19:39] to let get a little bit cold as the
[1:19:42] times go by
[1:19:44] see idolatry was one of these recurring
[1:19:48] themes in the old testament one of these
[1:19:50] the most common of the transgressions
[1:19:53] that israel would find themselves in
[1:19:55] and it wasn't that they totally would
[1:19:56] turn from god
[1:19:58] but they just have other gods
[1:20:02] side gods and it's so easy to fall into
[1:20:06] that
[1:20:07] that's the spirit of this age is the
[1:20:10] gods of
[1:20:12] of the riches of this this world it
[1:20:14] talks and
[1:20:15] we'll read a little later or in the rest
[1:20:17] of the message but it talks about how
[1:20:18] the laodicean church was
[1:20:21] rich and had need of nothing so
[1:20:23] materialistic
[1:20:25] so looking at their gold and their
[1:20:27] silver and their
[1:20:29] their fine clothes
[1:20:33] that they had other gods they still
[1:20:36] would go to church
[1:20:37] and still would worship jehovah
[1:20:42] but they had these other gods
[1:20:46] and it's so easy for that to come in and
[1:20:51] and to just start cooling off your love
[1:20:55] see solomon the wisest man that the
[1:20:58] world's ever seen outside of jesus
[1:21:00] christ he was so wise and his heart was
[1:21:04] right before the lord
[1:21:06] and he just started taking in these
[1:21:08] other gods
[1:21:09] to appease his wife's
[1:21:13] and it was the ruin of him and
[1:21:16] if we're not careful
[1:21:19] this same thing is trying to ruin us in
[1:21:22] this day
[1:21:23] to get us to look not at
[1:21:26] the love of our hearts our
[1:21:29] our our soul mate
[1:21:33] but to give most of it to him and just
[1:21:37] let these other little gods creep up
[1:21:39] these cares of the world these different
[1:21:43] things
[1:21:44] these things that you've got to do just
[1:21:46] to be accepted in the world
[1:21:49] to be sociable you can't just have your
[1:21:52] mind on jesus all the time
[1:21:54] that's fine now and again but just relax
[1:21:57] sometime and
[1:21:58] and uh you know have some other things
[1:22:00] to spend your time
[1:22:02] and you know you can be you can be 95
[1:22:05] percent about jesus but just
[1:22:08] have another 5 of something else
[1:22:12] that's it's so sneaky but then that five
[1:22:15] percent grows to seven
[1:22:18] to nine and the next thing you know
[1:22:20] that's all you can think about
[1:22:22] it's so easy to have your mind captured
[1:22:24] by
[1:22:25] imaginations of things that are not even
[1:22:27] bad
[1:22:28] but they're other gods there's something
[1:22:31] that comes between you and your time
[1:22:33] with your maker
[1:22:37] we can check our temperature how is our
[1:22:39] love
[1:22:40] is our love like that first love
[1:22:44] where he just said lord you're
[1:22:46] everything to me
[1:22:48] nothing else in this world matters
[1:22:51] all this is just gonna pass away it's a
[1:22:53] vapor my life is a vapor
[1:23:02] see no man can serve two masters
[1:23:07] either a loved one and hate the other
[1:23:10] and king of your life to be yourself
[1:23:14] and you can do that and still be a
[1:23:16] really convincing christian
[1:23:18] you can have you know i can have peter
[1:23:21] mcfadden be the lord of my life and i
[1:23:23] can still come to church
[1:23:25] i can still say amen i can still be
[1:23:28] moved by the spirit
[1:23:30] i could speak in tongues and maybe you
[1:23:33] couldn't tell the difference
[1:23:34] maybe i couldn't tell the difference but
[1:23:37] the lord sees the hearts
[1:23:40] and he knows if you have any other gods
[1:23:44] before
[1:23:46] him you can't
[1:23:49] you can't serve god and mammon
[1:23:53] a hard scripture but it's true luke 14
[1:23:57] and 25.
[1:24:13] and there went great multitudes with him
[1:24:16] and he turned and said unto them
[1:24:19] if a man if any man come to me
[1:24:22] and hate not his father or mother and
[1:24:25] mother
[1:24:26] and wife and children and brethren
[1:24:29] and sisters yea in his own life
[1:24:32] also he cannot be my disciple
[1:24:37] and whosoever does not bear his cross
[1:24:40] and come after me cannot be my disciple
[1:24:45] we don't like to read that one a lot
[1:24:47] because it
[1:24:49] kind of baffles us i thought we're
[1:24:52] supposed to be good fathers i suppose
[1:24:54] thought we were supposed to honor our
[1:24:56] our parents
[1:24:58] you know i thought we were supposed to
[1:24:59] care about our own selves
[1:25:03] but it's very clear
[1:25:07] that if in comparison to god
[1:25:10] you don't hate everything else he said
[1:25:12] you can't even be my disciple
[1:25:15] see that's that's part of the gospel
[1:25:20] you shall have no other gods beforehand
[1:25:24] lord help us help me where i've gotten
[1:25:27] cold
[1:25:28] there help me where i've put my
[1:25:31] family before you because see here's the
[1:25:34] thing is that if you'll
[1:25:36] leave father and mother houses and lands
[1:25:39] and everything
[1:25:41] for the sake of this gospel for the sake
[1:25:43] of his kingdom
[1:25:46] he will take care of your family he'll
[1:25:49] take care of you
[1:25:51] see that which you try to save you lose
[1:25:55] and that which you give away you say
[1:25:57] lord i'll lose it for your kingdom
[1:26:00] he'll save you can't save your family by
[1:26:04] putting them before god
[1:26:07] but you have to leave your family for
[1:26:08] god leave everything
[1:26:10] for him and just let him save your loved
[1:26:14] ones
[1:26:15] let him take care of it let let him
[1:26:19] use you to provide for your family say
[1:26:22] well i've gotta
[1:26:23] i've gotta give my life to my job
[1:26:25] because i've gotta be a provider for my
[1:26:27] family if i don't i'm worse than an
[1:26:28] infidel
[1:26:31] don't put that before god
[1:26:35] if you give your everything to god
[1:26:38] the bible says i've never seen the
[1:26:40] righteous forsaken
[1:26:42] or a seed go begging for bread your
[1:26:45] children will have provision
[1:26:47] if you go and leave everything for the
[1:26:50] kingdom
[1:26:52] but if you don't they might have shoes
[1:26:54] and food and everything like that
[1:26:57] but spiritually you won't be able to
[1:26:59] provide for them
[1:27:01] and they could end up starving there and
[1:27:03] then
[1:27:05] in that way you can end up in a much
[1:27:08] worse condition
[1:27:11] so even though it seems hard
[1:27:16] you just have to trust him you just have
[1:27:19] to trust that everything that he does
[1:27:20] is in love is perfect his ways are above
[1:27:24] our ways
[1:27:25] don't try to reason it out but just say
[1:27:28] lord
[1:27:30] every day you are god
[1:27:33] be god of my whole life don't let me
[1:27:36] have any other gods
[1:27:38] before you
[1:27:46] so that's one commandment we could go
[1:27:48] through more
[1:27:50] but that first one's see jesus said
[1:27:54] there's all these different commandments
[1:27:55] but he said on on these two commandments
[1:27:58] love the lord thy god with all thy heart
[1:27:59] soul mind
[1:28:00] strength and body love thy neighbor as
[1:28:02] thyself
[1:28:04] so that hang all the law and prophets on
[1:28:07] that
[1:28:08] and so when you want to take a
[1:28:10] temperature just look at those two
[1:28:12] things
[1:28:13] don't try to evaluate well have i uh
[1:28:17] you know you should evaluate all the
[1:28:19] other things but
[1:28:21] just look at that and pray before the
[1:28:25] lord say lord am i loving you with
[1:28:27] everything
[1:28:28] and am i loving nate my neighbor as
[1:28:30] myself
[1:28:33] use that as a chap cup and that's how
[1:28:36] you see
[1:28:37] if you're getting a little bit cool if
[1:28:40] you're cooling off a little bit not
[1:28:42] necessarily whether you're shouting and
[1:28:44] jumping but just as your life cooling
[1:28:46] off
[1:28:47] or other things coming in or the cares
[1:28:48] of the world coming in
[1:28:50] um i was listening to a
[1:28:55] sermon of brother greene my truck's real
[1:28:58] old
[1:28:59] and so it does some funny things and one
[1:29:02] of the funny things that it does that i
[1:29:04] really like
[1:29:05] is that it'll just randomly start
[1:29:08] playing rather green
[1:29:10] i'll be uh i'll be listening to the
[1:29:12] radio or something and i've got a cd in
[1:29:13] there
[1:29:14] i'll go for a bump or i'll turn it on or
[1:29:16] whatever and then all of a sudden it's
[1:29:17] just for the green instead of the radio
[1:29:19] oh okay guess i guess it's time to
[1:29:22] listen to this
[1:29:23] but i was listening to him and it made
[1:29:24] he was talking about
[1:29:26] just being so caught up with the
[1:29:29] different people that would always be
[1:29:31] calling him
[1:29:32] and trying to you know seek counsel from
[1:29:34] him and different things
[1:29:36] and it was just weighing so heavy on him
[1:29:40] it was just really wearing him down and
[1:29:44] he was talking about how you you've got
[1:29:47] to sometimes just
[1:29:48] even unplug the phone back when they had
[1:29:51] cordless phones some of you can remember
[1:29:54] that you know other other people
[1:29:57] it's good to help other people to have a
[1:29:58] heart for other people you have to
[1:30:01] but don't let that come before god even
[1:30:04] see one of the things brother green had
[1:30:06] to learn and i i wanted to find it i
[1:30:08] couldn't find it i'd i'd
[1:30:09] like to play it but um maybe you
[1:30:12] remember where
[1:30:13] brother green had the lord spoke to him
[1:30:16] and told him a couple things i wish i
[1:30:18] knew exactly what it was but my
[1:30:20] recollection of it
[1:30:21] which maybe one of you can correct me on
[1:30:24] exactly what it was but
[1:30:26] basically i think the lord told him to
[1:30:31] you know dial back on the things that
[1:30:34] were taking his time and energy
[1:30:36] and to sweeten his life in prayer
[1:30:40] so i think it was something along the
[1:30:41] lines of rid yourself
[1:30:43] rid your life for the things that are
[1:30:44] taking all this time and energy and
[1:30:48] sweeten your life in prayer
[1:30:50] and i thought that was really good
[1:30:53] i was thinking of there's a story in the
[1:30:56] old testament where
[1:30:58] the the prophet was going somewhere and
[1:31:01] the lord told
[1:31:02] him you know salute no man by the way
[1:31:05] and and so it seemed so very odd to us
[1:31:09] we think that we've always got to be so
[1:31:11] friendly to one another and
[1:31:12] and we can just we can end up putting
[1:31:15] that before god
[1:31:16] we're trying to please each other trying
[1:31:18] to cater to what one another wants to do
[1:31:20] and
[1:31:21] you know please this one please that one
[1:31:23] but the lord
[1:31:24] told him you know salute no man by the
[1:31:26] way
[1:31:28] and he ended up not listening to that
[1:31:29] and he there's this other
[1:31:31] uh character that ended up getting him
[1:31:35] to come and and um
[1:31:36] have a meal and he ended up i think he
[1:31:38] got eaten by lions or
[1:31:40] he ended up dying and uh
[1:31:43] just a reminder that
[1:31:48] the first priority should just be
[1:31:52] to please the lord jesus even if it
[1:31:55] means looking
[1:31:56] unfriendly and rude
[1:31:59] it's not about just blindly going
[1:32:03] and giving your energy sometimes you can
[1:32:06] you can end up casting your pearls
[1:32:07] before swine
[1:32:09] and you can end up just hurting your
[1:32:11] relationship with the lord because
[1:32:13] you're too busy trying to do it your own
[1:32:14] way
[1:32:15] but when jesus went the lord moved used
[1:32:18] him
[1:32:19] like there was never a human used
[1:32:23] but it was very targeted he did only the
[1:32:26] things that the father showed him
[1:32:28] see there were many at the pool of
[1:32:30] bethesda he went to one
[1:32:33] he walked by all the others you know
[1:32:34] these mothers and
[1:32:36] these old men many people would say how
[1:32:39] could you
[1:32:40] jesus hold on this other guy he's been
[1:32:43] here for 40 years
[1:32:46] but the lord knows the lord has a
[1:32:49] perfect plan
[1:32:51] there are many widows in the days of
[1:32:52] elijah
[1:32:54] he went to one and so
[1:32:57] sometimes you can even just get so
[1:33:00] caught up trying to
[1:33:02] to spread yourself so thin just trying
[1:33:04] to save the whole world
[1:33:08] but the pattern set in the bible is just
[1:33:11] to be
[1:33:13] your eyes totally on him totally
[1:33:16] surrendered to him
[1:33:18] totally open however the spirit of god
[1:33:20] would move you
[1:33:22] and then you don't have to go and try to
[1:33:23] figure it out and work it out he can
[1:33:25] just put you right there
[1:33:27] where he's already been working on the
[1:33:28] other end and just
[1:33:31] he can do the miraculous
[1:33:34] but it's important just to keep him
[1:33:36] first and then everyone else and not
[1:33:39] everyone else
[1:33:40] and then him so um
[1:33:44] i think we kind of spent a while on that
[1:33:47] let's
[1:33:47] let's talk about there's two ways to get
[1:33:49] into a lukewarm condition
[1:33:51] uh the first one is
[1:33:55] you're never boiling hot in the first
[1:33:57] place
[1:33:58] a lot of people kind of get started off
[1:34:00] and then
[1:34:01] they stop short they never fully
[1:34:05] surrender they never
[1:34:06] fully fall in love with lord like peter
[1:34:11] he was with the lord and outwardly
[1:34:16] he looked like he was on more on fire
[1:34:17] than maybe the rest of them
[1:34:19] he said lord i'll die for you look see
[1:34:21] my sword
[1:34:23] i am i am a disciple number one
[1:34:27] you know he was he was a big bold brash
[1:34:32] the lord said he wasn't even converted
[1:34:37] so a lot he he at that point he wasn't
[1:34:41] fully boiling hot even though he thought
[1:34:43] he was
[1:34:45] and so you ended up denying the lord so
[1:34:48] that's one way that you can end up
[1:34:51] to be in a lukewarm condition the other
[1:34:53] is
[1:34:54] that you were there but then just this
[1:34:56] iniquity has caused
[1:34:58] the love of many to wax cold like the
[1:35:00] ephesian church age and you've
[1:35:01] lost your first love but
[1:35:05] in both of those cases i was so
[1:35:07] encouraged by this
[1:35:09] in both the case of peter and the
[1:35:11] ephesian church age the lord was there
[1:35:14] to bring the temperature up to make a
[1:35:17] temperature change
[1:35:19] see on the one hand the one that was
[1:35:20] never fully there
[1:35:23] the word says that all that the father
[1:35:25] hath given will come see he's got a plan
[1:35:29] for each one for peter he had ordained
[1:35:31] for peter to to be changed
[1:35:33] and peter was changed then after that he
[1:35:35] was on fire he was bold he gave his
[1:35:37] whole life for the gospel
[1:35:39] his love was such that he said don't
[1:35:41] even crucify me
[1:35:43] in the manner my lord was crucified
[1:35:45] crucify me upside down
[1:35:48] i'm not even worthy to be crucified like
[1:35:52] him
[1:35:53] you know he he was he got the
[1:35:56] temperature turned up there
[1:35:58] he got to boiling and then
[1:36:02] with the the fusion church age the
[1:36:05] scripture that comes to mind is that
[1:36:07] he said he won't lose a one so if he's
[1:36:10] ever
[1:36:11] got a hold of one of his even though
[1:36:14] that one might
[1:36:16] backslide a little bit cool off a little
[1:36:18] bit have some other gods come in
[1:36:20] he's not going to lose one of his and um
[1:36:25] in revelation 2
[1:36:28] 4 and 5 where it's talking there to the
[1:36:30] ephesian church age
[1:36:32] we always we always reference the part
[1:36:35] where it says
[1:36:36] you lost your first love but if you read
[1:36:40] on a little bit
[1:36:42] revelation chapter 2 and verse
[1:36:46] 4 and 5
[1:36:49] he says nevertheless i have somewhat
[1:36:51] against thee because thou has left thy
[1:36:53] first love
[1:36:55] and then he says remember therefore from
[1:36:57] whence thou art fallen and repent
[1:36:59] and do the first works or else i will
[1:37:02] come unto thee quickly and will remove
[1:37:04] thy candlestick out of his place
[1:37:06] except our repen so he didn't just say
[1:37:09] ephesus you've you've blown it but he
[1:37:13] said ephesus come on let's come back to
[1:37:15] those first works come repent
[1:37:18] he's always drawing uh back
[1:37:21] back to himself
[1:37:25] so we can see uh the reason for this
[1:37:28] lukewarm condition
[1:37:29] in both cases is is this iniquity this
[1:37:32] this
[1:37:33] cooling off we know that the only
[1:37:36] sin is really unbelief
[1:37:39] and that's why our love can grow cold
[1:37:43] is that we don't trust that his promises
[1:37:44] are true
[1:37:46] we don't trust that they're for us
[1:37:50] and so we just get
[1:37:53] a little bit cold
[1:37:56] but the lord's lord's gracious
[1:38:00] that he doesn't just diagnose you but he
[1:38:03] prescribes a treatment for you
[1:38:05] he doesn't just say well you're you're
[1:38:08] cooled off and
[1:38:10] i'm going to spew you from my mouth
[1:38:11] period but look what it goes on to say
[1:38:14] let's let's go to revelation 3
[1:38:16] and we'll read on where we left off we
[1:38:18] uh
[1:38:19] we'll read we'll reread it again let's
[1:38:21] start in 14. uh revelation 3 and 14
[1:38:26] and we'll read down through 22
[1:38:30] then unto the angel of the church of
[1:38:31] laodiceans write these things saith the
[1:38:34] amen
[1:38:34] the faithful and true witness the
[1:38:36] beginning of the creation of god
[1:38:38] i know thy works that thou art neither
[1:38:40] cold nor hot
[1:38:41] i would thou were cold or hot so then
[1:38:44] because thou art lukewarm
[1:38:45] and neither cold or hot i will spew thee
[1:38:48] out of my mouth
[1:38:51] because thou sayest i am rich and
[1:38:53] increased with goods
[1:38:54] and have need of nothing
[1:38:59] and knows not that they are wretched and
[1:39:01] miserable
[1:39:02] and poor and blind and naked
[1:39:06] now he's going to say three things to
[1:39:08] get out of this condition listen
[1:39:11] i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
[1:39:14] in the fire
[1:39:15] that thou mayest be rich and white
[1:39:18] raiment
[1:39:18] that thou mayest be clothed and that the
[1:39:21] shame of thy nakedness
[1:39:22] do not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[1:39:25] i
[1:39:25] sath that thou mayest see see the three
[1:39:28] things by me gold
[1:39:30] and white raymond and anoint on eyes
[1:39:33] with isa
[1:39:34] so we're going to look just a little bit
[1:39:35] into that we've got a little bit of time
[1:39:37] left so we'll go quickly
[1:39:39] as many as i love i rebuke and chasten
[1:39:43] be zealous therefore and repent so
[1:39:46] all is not lost even if we find
[1:39:49] ourselves in this lukewarm condition the
[1:39:50] lord has
[1:39:51] has given us a prescription and he's
[1:39:54] saying this
[1:39:54] is this chastisement is from love
[1:39:58] be zealous therefore and repent he says
[1:40:01] behold i stand at the door and knock
[1:40:03] if any man hear my voice and open the
[1:40:06] door i will come in
[1:40:07] to him and will sup with him and he with
[1:40:10] me
[1:40:10] to him that overcometh while i grant to
[1:40:12] sit with me in my throne
[1:40:14] even as i also overcame and am set down
[1:40:17] with my father in his throne
[1:40:19] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[1:40:21] the spirit saith
[1:40:23] unto the churches amen
[1:40:27] so we'll we'll just go quickly
[1:40:30] here
[1:40:34] but these three things the first one
[1:40:37] by gold and we reminded me of
[1:40:42] in isaiah 55 and 1
[1:40:47] familiar scripture to us
[1:40:50] the lord says let me find it here
[1:40:56] isaiah 55 1 he says ho everyone that
[1:40:59] thirsteth
[1:41:00] coming to the waters and he that hath no
[1:41:02] money
[1:41:04] coming by and eat yay come buy wine
[1:41:08] and milk without money and without price
[1:41:12] and so we know that the lord
[1:41:16] is uh calling us to come and buy from
[1:41:19] him and here he's saying
[1:41:20] buy me gold dried by fire
[1:41:24] and what i what i thought here is
[1:41:30] they were so concerned with the natural
[1:41:32] things the laodiceans they were so
[1:41:34] concerned with the outward appearances
[1:41:36] and and their fine robes and everything
[1:41:38] that they didn't know that
[1:41:39] spiritually they were totally lacking
[1:41:41] totally
[1:41:42] um just naked
[1:41:46] but we know
[1:41:49] in the bible that it talks about seeking
[1:41:53] seeking the heavenly treasure those
[1:41:56] things valuing these these promises of
[1:42:00] god
[1:42:01] these uh this promised land of
[1:42:05] of um you know the
[1:42:09] the book of ephesians you know our
[1:42:12] promised land
[1:42:13] to go through
[1:42:16] we know that that these things of god
[1:42:20] and the person of jesus christ that
[1:42:22] ought to be our pearl of great price
[1:42:26] and so when you're gold when your
[1:42:28] treasure that you're looking at is the
[1:42:30] things of this world you're never going
[1:42:31] to be happy
[1:42:32] and you're never going to have a love
[1:42:35] for god
[1:42:36] that's hot and on fire
[1:42:39] your works are not going to be on fire
[1:42:43] because your treasure is on earth
[1:42:47] and our treasure ought not to be on
[1:42:48] earth not even
[1:42:50] in this earth but our treasure is
[1:42:53] spiritual
[1:42:54] in in the heavenly in in your spiritual
[1:42:57] walk with lord
[1:42:58] the treasures of his character and his
[1:43:02] love
[1:43:03] uh in in colossians 3 verses 1 to 4.
[1:43:10] we'll read
[1:43:19] colossians chapter 3 wonderful
[1:43:23] it says if ye then
[1:43:26] be risen with christ seek those things
[1:43:29] which are above
[1:43:31] where christ sitteth on the right hand
[1:43:32] of god
[1:43:34] set your affection on things above not
[1:43:36] on things of the earth
[1:43:38] for ye are dead and your life is hid
[1:43:40] with christ in god
[1:43:42] when christ who is our life shall appear
[1:43:45] then shall you also appear with him
[1:43:47] in glory so our
[1:43:50] gold our treasure ought to be on the
[1:43:53] things that are above
[1:43:55] and then in first peter 1 and
[1:43:58] 3 to 9
[1:44:01] it says blessed be the god and father
[1:44:05] our lord jesus christ
[1:44:07] which according to his abundant mercy
[1:44:09] hath begotten us again unto a lively
[1:44:11] hope
[1:44:12] by the resurrection of jesus christ from
[1:44:14] the dead
[1:44:15] see we're looking on the things that are
[1:44:16] above we're setting our affections on
[1:44:18] what he's done
[1:44:20] we're believing his promises to an
[1:44:22] inheritance incorruptible and undefiled
[1:44:25] that fadeth not away reserved in heaven
[1:44:28] for you
[1:44:29] which are kept by the power of god
[1:44:31] through faith unto salvation ready to be
[1:44:33] revealed in the last
[1:44:34] time wherein ye greatly rejoice though
[1:44:36] now for a season if need be you are in
[1:44:38] heaviness through manifold temptations
[1:44:40] that the trial of your faith being much
[1:44:43] more precious than of gold which
[1:44:45] perisheth
[1:44:45] that will be tried with fire might be
[1:44:48] found unto praise and honor and glory
[1:44:50] at the peering of our lord jesus of
[1:44:53] jesus christ so see the treasures are
[1:44:57] not the treasures of the latest sins the
[1:44:59] golden ladocians
[1:45:01] but the promises of god even the trials
[1:45:03] and the testing that the lord has put us
[1:45:05] through
[1:45:06] that's the gold that we buy from him is
[1:45:10] is those those spiritual treasures and
[1:45:13] as as that's our goal
[1:45:14] as that's our treasure then our faith
[1:45:18] and our love will grow and grow warm and
[1:45:20] and grow to boiling see what it says
[1:45:23] next is
[1:45:24] whom having not seen talking about jesus
[1:45:27] christ ye love
[1:45:29] see as you look on these things as you
[1:45:31] trust that your trials
[1:45:34] are to bring you to perfection that
[1:45:37] makes you more in love with him
[1:45:39] having not seen ye love in whom though
[1:45:42] ye
[1:45:42] see him not yet believing you rejoice
[1:45:44] with joy unspeakable and full of glory
[1:45:47] receiving the end of your faith even the
[1:45:48] salvation of your souls
[1:45:52] so that's the the first one is to buy
[1:45:54] gold
[1:45:56] of him the second one
[1:45:59] is white raymond and in
[1:46:03] we know that the ephesian church was
[1:46:06] naked and it's easy to get cold when
[1:46:07] you're naked
[1:46:09] but we know we're to be clothed on with
[1:46:11] this word
[1:46:12] with the promises with the character
[1:46:14] with the life of god
[1:46:16] we're to have that wedding garment that
[1:46:17] he's provided but we've got to put it on
[1:46:20] we know we've got to be washed with the
[1:46:22] water
[1:46:23] of the word and we know that as
[1:46:28] as we let that word minister to us
[1:46:32] it'll increase our love our faith it'll
[1:46:35] make our hearts burn just like the ones
[1:46:37] on the road to emmaus they said didn't
[1:46:39] our hearts burn within us
[1:46:41] as he talked with us by the way that he
[1:46:42] was expounding the scriptures
[1:46:44] and so as we as we stay just constantly
[1:46:48] in that word
[1:46:49] or this white raiment that we've been
[1:46:52] given to put on
[1:46:53] as we stay in that word then that's
[1:46:54] going to quicken our faith quicken our
[1:46:56] love and
[1:46:57] and our our
[1:47:01] will be on fire but we've got to submit
[1:47:04] to it we've got to not just hear it
[1:47:06] three times in in the new testament the
[1:47:08] bible commands
[1:47:10] the wives to submit to their husbands
[1:47:13] and that's not just in the natural but
[1:47:15] that's we as the bride of christ
[1:47:18] have got to submit to this word three
[1:47:21] times it says that that
[1:47:22] we've really got to submit to that word
[1:47:25] um
[1:47:26] the word washes away the sin from our
[1:47:29] lives
[1:47:30] the leprosy but jesus you know told
[1:47:34] the prophet told name and go wash wash
[1:47:37] in the
[1:47:38] water and your leprosy will be
[1:47:41] gone away and as the lord takes your
[1:47:44] sins away
[1:47:45] just makes you love him more and more
[1:47:50] but we've got to be uh we've got to be
[1:47:52] zealous and applying the word
[1:47:54] when you when you think of the example
[1:47:56] of how how should we uh
[1:47:59] how zealous should we be to clean up
[1:48:01] this temple
[1:48:02] based on his word we get the example of
[1:48:05] jesus with a whip
[1:48:07] driving out all the money changers all
[1:48:09] these other gods of
[1:48:11] of gold and silver that had come up in
[1:48:13] the temple of god
[1:48:14] that's how we ought to be and just
[1:48:17] zealous that the zeal of
[1:48:19] our father's house is eating us up so
[1:48:22] that's the second one the white raymond
[1:48:24] and then the third one is i sav
[1:48:30] i was thinking of uh you know if you
[1:48:33] if you look naturally
[1:48:36] it's easy to end up discouraged
[1:48:40] to let your faith grow cold to let your
[1:48:42] love grow cold
[1:48:44] to end up in a lukewarm condition
[1:48:47] if you look naturally but we've got to
[1:48:50] have eyes
[1:48:51] have we've got to say lord open my eyes
[1:48:54] that i can see spiritually
[1:48:57] just like elisha and the servant the
[1:49:00] lord opened his eyes and then he could
[1:49:02] see
[1:49:02] what was going on and then he went from
[1:49:05] discouraged and oh we're going to lose
[1:49:07] to he had he had victory he had
[1:49:10] i would imagine he had an increased love
[1:49:14] for the lord because he could see that
[1:49:15] the lord had not left him
[1:49:18] sometimes you think the lord has left
[1:49:20] you but just
[1:49:21] look to the spiritual say lord open my
[1:49:24] eyes give me eyes have to see
[1:49:25] that you have not left me you never
[1:49:28] neither leave me or nor forsake me
[1:49:31] but your promises are true if you can
[1:49:33] just look spiritually
[1:49:34] and you can meditate on the things of
[1:49:36] god just like the blind man that
[1:49:38] the lord spit on clay and put it on his
[1:49:41] eyes and
[1:49:42] gave him new eyes the lord is still
[1:49:43] opening the eyes of the vine
[1:49:46] and he's opening our eyes that we can
[1:49:48] meditate on the things of god
[1:49:51] first timothy 4 and 14.
[1:50:04] says
[1:50:08] oh 15 sorry
[1:50:11] it says meditate upon these things
[1:50:16] give thyself holy to them that thy
[1:50:18] prophecy
[1:50:19] profiting may appear to all
[1:50:22] if you want to fall more in love with
[1:50:24] the lord if you want to increase your
[1:50:25] faith
[1:50:26] meditate on these things just like david
[1:50:29] was always pondering the things of the
[1:50:30] lord in his heart
[1:50:32] you hear you don't hear a lot about
[1:50:34] meditation
[1:50:36] these days the the world has gone and
[1:50:38] taken meditation something totally
[1:50:39] different
[1:50:40] but a believer's meditation is on the
[1:50:42] things of god and on the word of god
[1:50:44] on the promises of god that just let
[1:50:46] those
[1:50:49] let those flow through your mind and
[1:50:51] through your spirit
[1:50:53] and it'll give you a joy and a love
[1:50:56] that'll encourage you and and
[1:50:59] get you on fire for the lord you can
[1:51:02] think about how he's
[1:51:03] predestinated you chosen you before the
[1:51:05] foundation of the world
[1:51:07] how he's fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:51:09] you you can behold what manner of love
[1:51:12] the father has given to us
[1:51:13] that we should be called the sons of god
[1:51:16] you can meditate on those things
[1:51:19] and the eye salve allows you to walk by
[1:51:21] faith
[1:51:22] and not by sight as
[1:51:25] a story that all i'll share as we're
[1:51:27] closing
[1:51:28] kind of along those lines of walking by
[1:51:30] faith and not by sight there's a
[1:51:33] time that nobody had ever flown across
[1:51:35] the atlantic ocean before
[1:51:38] flying was new and they were still
[1:51:41] trying to stay close to land so they
[1:51:43] didn't end up in the
[1:51:44] in the water and so there was a man that
[1:51:46] was going to go and he was going to try
[1:51:48] to do what nobody had done before and
[1:51:50] fly across
[1:51:51] the atlantic ocean and his name was
[1:51:55] charles lindbergh
[1:51:56] and he did it he went farther than
[1:51:58] anyone had ever gone that way
[1:52:01] but what he did that allowed him to do
[1:52:03] it
[1:52:04] where i believe others had tried and
[1:52:06] probably failed
[1:52:08] but what he did is he realized that he
[1:52:10] was going to need a lot of gasoline to
[1:52:12] make it across
[1:52:13] this was such a far journey for him to
[1:52:16] go
[1:52:17] and so what he chose to do is he had a
[1:52:19] special built plane
[1:52:21] just for this flight he called it the
[1:52:22] spirit of st louis
[1:52:24] and he built this plane he needed so
[1:52:27] much gas that the only place that he
[1:52:28] could put it is right in the front
[1:52:30] so you've got to get the balance all
[1:52:31] right put it right in the front where
[1:52:33] usually your window would be to see out
[1:52:34] the front
[1:52:36] because he he knew that he needed more
[1:52:39] the gasoline than even that he needed to
[1:52:41] see in front of him
[1:52:43] because he could trust his instruments
[1:52:46] he could trust what was going on
[1:52:48] inside or he knew the gasoline would
[1:52:50] take him there
[1:52:52] and he just said i don't even need to
[1:52:54] see it
[1:52:55] i'm going all the way
[1:52:59] what a type for us we're not on the
[1:53:01] spirit of saint louis
[1:53:03] but we're we're going by the spirit of
[1:53:05] jesus christ
[1:53:06] farther than anyone's ever gone before
[1:53:10] this isn't an age that we need to see
[1:53:12] out the front window even though we're
[1:53:13] going somewhere no one's
[1:53:16] our our captain has gone before
[1:53:19] but we can say just fill the plane with
[1:53:22] the power
[1:53:24] that's all i want i don't need to see
[1:53:26] out but just pack that plane full of
[1:53:28] power
[1:53:31] and let's go
[1:53:35] anoint our eyes with eyes have that we
[1:53:36] can see by faith
[1:53:39] the musicians would come if we'll do
[1:53:43] these things
[1:53:44] if we'll buy gold if we'll
[1:53:47] buy this white raymond and if we'll
[1:53:50] anoint our eyes with i salve that we can
[1:53:52] see him
[1:53:53] and our love will grow then that love
[1:53:55] will change our works it'll change the
[1:53:57] way that we act
[1:53:59] just
[1:54:03] i want to be changed i want the lord to
[1:54:07] to be able to look at my works and say
[1:54:12] peter mcfadden is boiling hot
[1:54:15] not by anything that he's done but by
[1:54:17] the grace that's been given to him he's
[1:54:19] walked in the way
[1:54:21] walked in the way the lord's provided
[1:54:24] and my my desire is just to hear him say
[1:54:28] well done
[1:54:28] one of these days and i don't believe
[1:54:31] that
[1:54:31] that's something that's just reserved
[1:54:33] for brother branham and paul
[1:54:36] but just play something softly if you
[1:54:39] would
[1:54:40] but if we'll just give our lives to this
[1:54:42] word
[1:54:44] if we'll have no other gods before him
[1:54:48] i believe we can each hear him say well
[1:54:50] done one of these days
[1:54:54] it's not by our own strength or by our
[1:54:56] power but it's by his grace
[1:54:58] that he'll take us and make us what we
[1:55:00] need to be he'll take us through that
[1:55:02] that uh phase transformation from water
[1:55:05] to steam
[1:55:08] he's he's got the power he's got the gas
[1:55:13] how many wants to be on fire more
[1:55:16] more in love with him let's just pray
[1:55:21] lord jesus your word is life to us
[1:55:27] in this age that all we can see
[1:55:29] everywhere is just death
[1:55:31] spiritual death and iniquity lord even
[1:55:35] if we look in ourselves so often we see
[1:55:38] just such iniquity and such blackness
[1:55:40] such unbelief

[1:55:59] or a wife that submits to her husband
[1:56:02] and everything we want to be that wife
[1:56:04] lord we want to be submitted to your
[1:56:06] word
