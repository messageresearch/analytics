[23:56] over in the by and
[24:03] by there'll be all
[24:06] eternity and and you know as a father I
[24:09] I looked out and I saw Sarah sitting
[24:11] back there and she'll probably have a
[24:13] question why
[24:15] Lord why wasn't there healing right away
[24:18] why wasn't but God has a reason God has
[24:21] a reason I would say because because Dad
[24:24] said so and she'd asked me why and I
[24:27] said because Dad said so and she goes
[24:29] that's not a good answer
[24:31] why the other girls would say okay dad
[24:33] said so that's good enough but not Sarah
[24:36] but that's out allowed her to be who she
[24:38] is when the doctor said it's because of
[24:39] this and she would say why then the
[24:42] doctor would have to tell her why and
[24:44] then she would say but I'll tell you why
[24:45] I'm going to stand this way because I
[24:47] have a God that will take care of me we
[24:50] were sitting in the in the in the
[24:52] restaurant one day some time after that
[24:56] and she looks and she goes remember the
[24:57] doctor I told me that if I didn't get a
[25:01] heart uh kidney transplant I'd either be
[25:04] dead in a couple of weeks or I'd come
[25:07] barely crawling in that's him sitting
[25:09] there looking at me like is that really
[25:13] her and she goes yes it is
[25:15] me we serve a living God come on and the
[25:19] only real peace that I have dear lord

[28:01] have dear
[28:03] Lord is in
[28:06] you thank you so
[28:08] much good
[28:11] evening going to do this a little
[28:13] differently tonight and ask you to be
[28:14] seated for just a moment I want to start
[28:17] a little differently and by the way
[28:18] you're probably aware of it but in the
[28:20] booth in the back there's a handout for
[28:23] part four with the scriptures and some
[28:25] of the slides that uh we hope to project
[28:30] I realize that this study is a bit
[28:34] different taking several evenings to
[28:37] look at the life of one person in the
[28:39] Bible
[28:40] Joseph I'd like to play a short excerpt
[28:43] from Brother Branham a message that he
[28:46] titled Joseph meeting his Brethren it's
[28:49] the only sermon I found that referenced
[28:51] our topic Joseph in its title he's
[28:55] speaking of Genesis being the beginning
[28:57] and foreshadowing everything
[29:00] else I wish we had just about three
[29:03] months on this to stay right on this one
[29:08] subject and just dig it hide by the Holy
[29:12] Spirit by God's cards and just wrap it
[29:17] together and watch how every word just
[29:21] do Tails right in with the other words
[29:25] amen such a beautiful thing
[29:29] the word of God Is So
[29:32] inspiring no matter what age what time
[29:36] every man that's ever read this text
[29:39] through the it's been written now for
[29:42] many hundreds yeah for near
[29:45] 3,000 more
[29:47] years and every man that's ever read
[29:51] this text in every age is inspired
[29:56] by every ver of scripture there's
[30:00] nothing else can ever take its
[30:03] place I thought that that was a a very
[30:06] appropriate sort of lead in to this and
[30:10] to my opinion one of the most vital
[30:13] texts of the Old Testament Joseph we
[30:17] going to speak on meeting his Brethren
[30:19] there could be a hundred different ways
[30:21] that the Holy Spirit get into this and
[30:24] unfold it to our hearts and mind
[30:28] with that as background let's proceed I
[30:31] was excited last time we met you
[30:34] probably could tell but I'm even more
[30:36] excited
[30:37] tonight why because we'll see such
[30:42] precision and what God has preserved for
[30:45] us to bring astonishing Clarity to a
[30:49] very murky time and place in history
[30:52] before we resume let's stand and join
[30:55] together once more in prayer
[31:01] dear Lord Jesus it's a humbling
[31:04] experience to Stand Here Lord to hear
[31:06] the voice of brother brandom encouraging
[31:09] us to dig into the word and to take our
[31:11] time to be standing at at a Pulpit where
[31:15] he once spoke Lord Lord I just pray that
[31:18] you would help Lord that the words that
[31:20] are spoken tonight be words that are
[31:23] pleasing to you be words that are coming
[31:25] from you to each one of us Lord that
[31:27] that you'd answer questions in our minds
[31:29] settle doubts in our hearts Lord draw us
[31:32] closer to yourself and to one another
[31:34] help us to manifest the spirit of Jesus
[31:37] Christ that love that we have for you
[31:39] towards each other Lord we thank you for
[31:42] your word forgive us where we fall short
[31:44] Lord we commit this evening into your
[31:47] hands and thank you for this privilege
[31:50] that we have in Jesus precious name
[31:55] amen for our opening verses
[31:58] I'd like to read three short passages
[32:01] they reflect Joseph's Journey thus far
[32:03] as as well as his character and the
[32:06] first is found as you probably expect in
[32:08] First
[32:09] Peter First Peter chapter 5 starting in
[32:13] the middle of verse 5 be clothed with
[32:17] humility Let It Be Your garment for God
[32:21] resists the proud and gives grace to the
[32:25] humble humble yourselves there for where
[32:30] under the what Mighty hand of who God
[32:36] that he may exalt you when in due
[32:40] time how casting all your care upon him
[32:46] why because he cares for
[32:49] you and meanwhile in in that white space
[32:52] that we talked about last time be sober
[32:56] be vigilant always always alert paying
[32:59] attention because your adversary the
[33:02] devil as a roaring lion walks about
[33:06] seeking whom he may
[33:07] devour don't be his next meal whom
[33:12] resist steadfast in the faith don't let
[33:15] your guard down even for a
[33:18] moment Peter described Joseph so well in
[33:22] these
[33:23] verses the next is from a letter Paul
[33:26] wrote to a church never visited written
[33:29] at the same time he penned a letter to a
[33:31] person in that church regarding a slave
[33:35] turn to Colossians
[33:41] 3 verse 22 Paul says servants that's
[33:44] literally slaves obey in all things your
[33:48] Masters according to the flesh not with
[33:51] ey Service as men Pleasers but in
[33:54] singleness of heart fearing God exactly
[33:58] the way Joseph served potier and
[34:01] whatsoever you do do it heartily as to
[34:05] the Lord not unto
[34:07] men knowing that in complete confidence
[34:12] not hoping or wishing but knowing that
[34:16] of your Earthly Master no of the Lord
[34:20] you shall receive the
[34:22] reward what reward of The
[34:26] Inheritance how do you know no for ye
[34:29] serve the Lord
[34:31] Christ that also describes Joseph the
[34:34] next reading is a single verse nearby
[34:37] James
[34:39] 4 he simply says humble yourselves in
[34:43] the sight of the
[34:45] Lord he's with you everywhere you can't
[34:47] hide from him you're always in his sight
[34:50] humble yourselves therefore in the sight
[34:52] of the Lord and He Shall lift you up and
[34:56] we'll see that exactly happening in this
[35:00] evening's lesson please be
[35:05] seated a quick recap in part one we saw
[35:09] Joseph who was his dad's favorite son he
[35:12] had two dreams his brothers had hated
[35:14] him it made them made him hate him even
[35:16] more after the first one and they became
[35:18] jealous after the second one his dad
[35:21] Jacob sent him to check on his brothers
[35:23] who were pastoring sheep about 50 miles
[35:25] away they saw Joseph coming decided to
[35:29] kill
[35:30] him but they were dissuaded first by
[35:32] Ruben who got them to delay things toss
[35:36] them in a pit and just hold off for a
[35:37] bit and then by Judah Who convinced the
[35:40] others to sell Joseph to some Israelite
[35:43] spice traders that were headed for Egypt
[35:45] they then took Joseph's coat dipped it
[35:47] in a young goat's blood deceiving their
[35:49] father to believe that Joseph had been
[35:51] killed by some wild
[35:54] animal in part two we learned why the
[35:57] brother brothers were confident the
[35:58] spice Traders would sell Joseph into
[36:00] slaver in Egypt Joseph was sold to
[36:03] potier the captain of Pharaoh's guard he
[36:05] he worked hard showed himself to be
[36:07] trustworthy and smart he was eventually
[36:10] promoted and became Piper's Chief
[36:12] Operating Officer For Better or Worse
[36:15] Joseph was a very handsome young man in
[36:17] his mid 20s attracted the attention of
[36:20] Mrs P She kept trying to seduce him and
[36:23] in her failure framed him for
[36:25] execution in part three
[36:28] we found that potier knew his wife was
[36:30] guilty but rather than execute Joseph
[36:33] potier sent him to the Royal VIP prison
[36:36] where he again became the number two
[36:37] person running the prison during his
[36:40] time there he interpreted the dreams of
[36:42] Pharaoh's Chief cup Bearer and chief
[36:44] Baker after that he spent two more years
[36:47] in the prison in the in the white space
[36:49] between chapters 40 and 41 and in that
[36:52] space he became very familiar with the
[36:55] protocol personalities and workings of
[36:59] soret 2's Royal
[37:01] Court we endered part three with soret
[37:04] having two dreams that struck him
[37:06] personally as they could mean bad things
[37:08] were going to happen to his
[37:12] family none of the Court magicians or
[37:14] wise men could help him they couldn't
[37:17] tell him what the dreams meant and and
[37:18] the dream manual used by the
[37:20] professional interpreters didn't
[37:22] help we also saw that the surviving
[37:25] fragment of a dream manual including
[37:27] uded the cup bearer's dream but its
[37:30] interpretation was exactly the opposite
[37:33] of what Joseph told him it had
[37:37] meant the chief cup Bearer then told
[37:40] Pharaoh about a Hebrew slave and Piper's
[37:43] Detention Center who could interpret
[37:45] dreams Pharaoh sent for this person we
[37:48] know this person as Joseph let's pick up
[37:51] our story as the cup Bearer is finishing
[37:54] recounting his experience with Joseph in
[37:56] the prison and The Round House in the
[37:59] pit in the dungeon two years prior the
[38:01] cup Bearer is speaking and he's speaking
[38:03] in the third person and he speaking to
[38:06] pharaoh and it came to pass as Joseph
[38:10] interpreted our dreams to us so it was
[38:14] me Pharaoh restored unto mine office as
[38:16] Chief cup Bearer Butler and and him the
[38:20] baker Pharaoh
[38:22] hanged then Pharaoh sent and called
[38:25] Joseph and they brought him hastily
[38:27] pharaoh
[38:28] anxious this can't wait an extra minute
[38:31] you guys can't help me go get this guy
[38:34] so they brought him hastily out of the
[38:35] dungeon can you see potier rushing back
[38:38] to his house shouting to the warden open
[38:41] the gate to the prison dungeon a flash
[38:45] of sunlight pierces the darkness within
[38:47] the
[38:48] prison outlined in that darkness is the
[38:51] imposing figure of a very nervous potier
[38:53] as he enters he calls for Joseph come
[38:56] out at once
[38:58] Joseph quickly emerges from the Gloom
[39:01] holding up his hand and blinking his
[39:02] eyes at all of a sudden brightness come
[39:06] with me Joseph Pharaoh's had two dreams
[39:09] no one can interpret you remember his
[39:11] Butler and Baker from two years ago the
[39:14] butler claims you correctly interpreted
[39:16] their dreams now Senor wants you to
[39:18] interpret his dreams dreams more like
[39:22] nightmares and uh uh uh Joe uh let's
[39:25] keep the matter of Mrs p and wi are
[39:28] serving in the prison between us
[39:31] okay and we readed he shaved himself and
[39:34] changed His Garment changed his
[39:36] reignment Egyptians especially
[39:39] nobility shaved their entire bodies
[39:43] every hair was gone they wore wigs
[39:46] appearance was very
[39:48] important as was cologne the smells of
[39:51] the spice
[39:52] Traders here we see yet another parallel
[39:55] with Jesus recall Jes Jesus was in a pit
[39:58] a tomb he was wrapped in spices when the
[40:01] door was opened the stone rolled away
[40:03] the Morning Light flashed within he was
[40:06] no longer there he had a change of
[40:08] reignment Peter saw his grave clothes
[40:10] and headscarf in the tomb where Jesus
[40:12] left them behind and he was not even
[40:15] recognized by his closest friends after
[40:17] his change of appearance Mary Magdalene
[40:20] thought he was the gner until he spoke
[40:23] her
[40:23] name and shortly after leaving his tomb
[40:26] his pit he ascended to sit at the right
[40:29] hand of the Throne of God go back to
[40:34] Joseph so Joseph's body was shaved scalp
[40:38] beard oh I don't know if I don't if I'd
[40:40] like that everywhere he was given proper
[40:43] attire and no doubt perfumed again
[40:46] recalling the odors of his forced march
[40:49] to Egypt eyeliner applied and came in
[40:53] under Pharaoh the Egyptian god king
[40:58] and Pharaoh senusret wasting no time
[41:01] said unto Joseph I have dreamed a dream
[41:04] there's none that can interpret it I've
[41:06] heard say of thee by my cup Bearer here
[41:08] that that you can understand a dream to
[41:10] interpret
[41:11] it Joseph answered Pharaoh using all the
[41:15] skills knowledge he had gained during
[41:17] his years in the white space correct
[41:19] demeanor tilting his head in respect
[41:22] speaking with humility
[41:25] saying it's not in me me God shall give
[41:29] Pharaoh an answer of
[41:32] peace and Pharaoh said unto Joseph in my
[41:35] dream behold I stood upon the bank of
[41:38] the river and behold they came up out of
[41:40] the river seven cows fat fleshed well
[41:44] favored oh they they fed in a
[41:46] meadow and behold seven other cows came
[41:50] up after them poor and very ill-favored
[41:52] and lean fleshed s gets a little
[41:55] emotional offering a new retail he leans
[41:57] over looks Joseph in the such as I never
[42:00] saw in all the land of Egypt for
[42:03] Badness and the lean and ill-favored
[42:05] cows did eat up the first seven fat
[42:09] cows and when they had eaten them up it
[42:12] could not be known they had eaten them
[42:13] at all they were still ill-favored is it
[42:15] the
[42:16] beginning so I awoke and then I fell
[42:21] asleep and dreamed again and I saw in my
[42:24] dream and behold seven ears of grain
[42:26] came up and one One stock full and
[42:29] good and behold seven ears withered thin
[42:34] blasted with the East Wind sprung up
[42:36] after them and the thin ears devoured
[42:40] the seven good
[42:42] ears I told this unto The Magicians but
[42:44] there was none that declar the meaning
[42:46] of it to
[42:49] me Joseph said unto Pharaoh the dream of
[42:53] pharaoh is one both dreams have a common
[42:55] meaning God ha showed Pharaoh what he is
[42:58] about to do again humility Pharaoh
[43:02] doesn't have a clue but God is showing
[43:05] Joseph through Pharaoh's dreams what is
[43:07] about to happen Joseph could be Brash
[43:10] and say oh I know what this is but he
[43:13] doesn't he isn't like that it's always
[43:16] about Pharaoh he knows Court protocol he
[43:20] understands
[43:21] egos he spent two years in that white
[43:25] space those seven good cows are seven
[43:28] years uh seven good ears of grain are
[43:31] seven years the the dreams are one the
[43:34] seven thin and ill-favored cows that
[43:36] came up after them are seven years and
[43:39] the Seven empty ears blasted with the
[43:41] East Wind shall be seven years of
[43:45] famine this is the thing which I have
[43:47] spoken under Pharaoh what God is about
[43:49] to do he showeth Pharaoh not shown to me
[43:53] but God has shown through me to pharaoh
[43:57] Joseph is humbly saying in other words
[43:59] thus sayeth the
[44:03] Lord wrong way behold there come seven
[44:07] years of great plenty throughout all the
[44:09] land of Egypt and there shall arise
[44:12] after them seven years of famine and all
[44:16] the Plenty shall be forgotten in the
[44:17] land of Egypt by the famine that will
[44:20] consume the
[44:21] land the Plenty shall not be known in
[44:24] the land by reason of that famine
[44:26] following
[44:27] it shall be very
[44:29] Grievous and for that the dream was
[44:31] doubled unto Pharaoh twice it came two
[44:33] times in two forms is because the thing
[44:37] is established by God and God will
[44:40] shortly bring it to
[44:42] pass you can imagine
[44:45] somebody's many people's perhaps Jaws
[44:48] dropping a seven-year
[44:51] famine in Egypt
[44:55] what there may have been a Court
[44:57] historian present who could lean over
[45:00] and whisper in Pharaoh's ear telling
[45:02] about a drought in the third Dynasty
[45:05] this is rare about 800 years earlier so
[45:08] famous in fact there was a stone Stella
[45:10] erected on sahal Island at Aswan that
[45:13] recorded
[45:14] it it it reads in part I was in mourning
[45:17] on my Throne my heart was in great
[45:20] Affliction because happy the the river
[45:22] God had failed to come in time in a
[45:25] period of seven
[45:27] years grain was scant Colonels were
[45:29] dried up scarce was every kind of food
[45:32] children cried youngsters fell the
[45:34] hearts of the old were grieving legs
[45:36] drawn up they hugged the ground everyone
[45:38] was in
[45:40] distress and only 42 years before the
[45:43] moment Joseph speaks to Pharaoh there
[45:45] had been another less serious famine
[45:48] uncommon not unheard of but seven years
[45:53] disaster and now some free advice
[45:57] Joseph learned all about court protocol
[45:59] in prison during the white space so he's
[46:01] not intimidated by speaking to the king
[46:03] in this way he knows how to keep Pharaoh
[46:06] at the center of things he's been a good
[46:08] student of protocol and politics but
[46:11] notice what Joseph says is much more
[46:14] than free
[46:16] advice last year we went through all the
[46:19] books of the Minor
[46:20] Prophets there was a consistent theme
[46:23] you probably recall judgment destruction
[46:26] ction was coming but always with a
[46:30] Lifeline always with hope and the
[46:33] spiritual it was based on repentance
[46:35] taking action to turn from sin here
[46:39] we'll see the Lord offering the same
[46:41] thing it's the same Lord a Lifeline hope
[46:45] Pharaoh listen to The Prophet Joseph
[46:49] heed what he says to save yourself and
[46:51] your
[46:53] nation now therefore let Pharaoh look
[46:55] out a man discreet
[46:57] humble knows how to handle himself and
[47:00] wise wiser than the wise men who
[47:02] couldn't interpret your dreams and set
[47:05] them over the land of Egypt let Pharaoh
[47:08] do this let him appoint officers over
[47:10] the land take up the fifth part of the
[47:12] land of Egypt in the seven plenteous
[47:15] years now the normal tax was 10% they
[47:18] had a thing that called a nilometer
[47:20] along the Nile a whole board in the
[47:22] ground and calibrated depending on how
[47:24] high the Nile Rose during the flood time
[47:27] they would know that a good farmer doing
[47:29] a good job would get so much yield per
[47:31] acre they calculated the tax on that if
[47:34] you weren't such a good farmer well you
[47:36] were paying more than 10% but it was
[47:38] based on what you should
[47:39] get so Joseph is telling Pharaoh double
[47:43] the
[47:46] tax and let the new wheat officials
[47:49] gather all the wheat of those good years
[47:51] that come and lay up the grain under the
[47:53] hand of Pharaoh let them keep food in
[47:56] the city
[47:57] and and that wheat shall be for store to
[47:59] the land against the seven years of
[48:02] famine which shall be in the land of
[48:04] Egypt that the land perish not through
[48:07] the
[48:08] famine and the thing was good in the
[48:10] eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of all
[48:12] his servants hey I like that double the
[48:16] tax and it's done as a national tax not
[48:19] a local tax gome by gnome or county by
[48:22] county so it increases my wealth and
[48:24] power and by reducing a supply we prop
[48:27] up the price of wheat during the glut
[48:29] huh what's not to like kind of the the
[48:32] debeers of
[48:34] wheat Pharaoh said unto his servants can
[48:37] we find such a one as this is a man in
[48:40] whom the spirit of God is a guy who can
[48:44] interpret dreams not listed in the
[48:46] book and Pharaoh said to Joseph for as
[48:50] much as God has showed thee all this
[48:52] including your proposals about how to
[48:54] manage things and double the taxes
[48:57] there is none so discreet and wise as
[49:00] you I know these things I'm pharaoh and
[49:03] we'll see later this evening how Pharaoh
[49:05] takes credit for one of Joseph's most
[49:09] amazing
[49:10] accomplishments a friend I worked for
[49:12] for years once commented to me he said
[49:15] Lyle it's amazing what you can
[49:17] accomplish if you don't care who gets
[49:20] the
[49:21] credit very true
[49:24] words thou Joseph sh be over my house
[49:26] house and according unto Thy word shall
[49:29] all my people be ruled only in the
[49:31] throne will I be greater than thou
[49:33] you'll be my right hand
[49:35] man and Pharaoh said to Joseph see I
[49:40] have set thee over all the land of Egypt
[49:43] oh by the way Piper yeah yeah be sure to
[49:46] protect Joseph you're working for him
[49:48] now he's a Hebrew Egyptians don't take
[49:52] orders from Hebrews but but we need this
[49:54] one and Pharaoh took off his signant
[49:56] ring from his hand and put it upon
[49:59] Joseph's hand and arrayed him in
[50:01] vestures of fine linen put a gold chain
[50:03] about his neck and Joseph be sure you
[50:07] keep your body shaved wear a wig use
[50:10] cologne and eyeliner and do your best to
[50:13] look like an
[50:15] Egyptian this signant ring is from King
[50:18] tudan common about 750 years after
[50:21] Joseph received Senus rett's similar
[50:24] ring the pharaoh's signant ring served
[50:27] as a modern equivalent in our society of
[50:29] his
[50:30] signature we saw about executive orders
[50:32] in the big signature at the bottom and
[50:34] this case you just stamp it with your
[50:37] signant Ring The Ring gave Joseph the
[50:39] power to do almost anything allowed of
[50:41] the central government recall in our
[50:43] study of Esther how morai used the
[50:45] king's Ring to seal official
[50:48] documents it's a big deal giving Joseph
[50:51] tremendous Authority not unlike his
[50:55] special coat indicated his preferred
[50:57] position and Authority when he was
[51:00] 17 and Pharaoh made Joseph to ride in
[51:03] the second Chariot which he had the
[51:06] Chariot for his second in command this
[51:07] image is is uh King tutt's ceremonial
[51:10] Chariot and they cried before him bow
[51:13] the
[51:14] knee and senusret made Joseph ruler over
[51:19] all the land of Egypt and Pharaoh said
[51:22] unto Joseph I'm pharaoh and I decree
[51:26] that with without your permission or
[51:27] approval no man shall as much as lift up
[51:30] his hand or his foot in all the land of
[51:35] Egypt and Pharaoh called Joseph's name
[51:38] zapan panea it's an Egyptian not a
[51:40] Hebrew name and he gave him to wife azth
[51:45] the daughter of pipera priest of an oh
[51:48] zafy have you been to my hometown own
[51:52] there's a new obl there you should see I
[51:54] used to play by it with my friends when
[51:56] I was a little girl oh I'm getting all
[51:59] tingly and Joseph went out over all the
[52:03] land of
[52:04] Egypt other translations say he
[52:07] inspected went about his duties
[52:09] throughout the land of Egypt he's
[52:11] checking out the Farms deciding whether
[52:14] granard will be constructed to deal with
[52:15] the future famine to have storage from
[52:18] the years of plenty after his years
[52:20] working the fields on Piper's Estates
[52:23] where the Lord blessed the yield Joseph
[52:25] knows how to get the the best from the
[52:27] land of Egypt about the seasons and
[52:29] floods and irrigation all of it he's
[52:33] gathering information and sharing with
[52:35] the poorly performing Fields the best
[52:37] practices from the higher yielding farms
[52:40] and not just one and done but
[52:42] continually making sure the granaries
[52:44] will be full in preparation for the
[52:46] oncoming
[52:48] famine does that remind you of someone
[52:51] else
[52:58] Luke 3:21 we read now when all the
[53:01] people were baptized it came to pass
[53:03] that Jesus also being baptized and
[53:06] praying the heaven was opened and the
[53:09] Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape
[53:12] like a dove upon him and a voice Came
[53:13] From Heaven which said Thou Art my
[53:15] beloved Son in thee I am well
[53:19] pleased sounds a bit like genesis 41:38
[53:23] Pharaoh said to his servants can we find
[53:25] such a one as this a man in whom the
[53:27] spirit of God
[53:30] is and Jesus himself began to be about
[53:34] 30 years of age being as was supposed
[53:37] the son of Joseph and what did
[53:39] 30-year-old Jesus
[53:44] do Jesus went about all the cities and
[53:47] Villages teaching in their synagogues
[53:49] preaching the gospel of the Kingdom
[53:50] healing every sickness and every disease
[53:52] among the
[53:53] people back to 30-year-old Joseph who
[53:56] let the presence of pharaoh and went out
[53:58] over all the land of Egypt look zaffy
[54:02] there's the Obelisk I was telling you
[54:06] about and in the seven plenteous years
[54:09] the earth brought forth by
[54:17] handfuls handfuls of
[54:21] grain and he gathered up all the food
[54:23] all the wheat of the seven years which
[54:25] were in the land of Egypt Egypt and laid
[54:27] up the food in the cities the food of
[54:29] the field which is round about every
[54:32] city laid up in the
[54:34] same and Joseph gathered corn grain as
[54:39] the sand of the sea very much until he
[54:42] left numbering it for it was without
[54:43] number I've got microphone number two
[54:47] here Joseph was trying to count His
[54:51] blessings and he had so many blessings
[54:54] he finally stopped Counting he couldn't
[54:57] count them that probably reminds us of
[55:00] us now I think that there's three people
[55:02] out here in the audience that have
[55:03] question for me um I don't see anyone
[55:07] raising their hand but I think Adam over
[55:10] here just might
[55:12] be a fellow with a question you got a
[55:16] question you said this all happened
[55:18] 4,000 years ago yeah how can you be sure
[55:20] of of this particular amount of
[55:23] years well that's a very good question
[55:26] very
[55:29] astute I'll answer that we'll go over
[55:31] that I don't want you to take my word
[55:32] for it and and I think someone else has
[55:36] a question yes I oh I see somebody
[55:39] smiling over it must be Lydia Lydia do
[55:42] you have a
[55:43] question you keep saying that zarat the
[55:47] second was the king during the time of
[55:50] Joseph how are you sure it wasn't some
[55:51] other
[55:52] king with all the uncertainties in the
[55:55] history of Egypt and life of pharaohs in
[55:57] the periods of intermediacy and all that
[56:00] that's also a very very good
[56:08] question oh somebody in the AV Booth
[56:11] waving her hand I think it's
[56:13] Ava okay
[56:16] Ava how did 20% of the grain provide
[56:20] enough food for the people of Egypt and
[56:21] for the people who bought
[56:24] grain oh that's another tyffy how with
[56:28] only 20% of the Harvest can you feed
[56:31] everybody and feed people from the
[56:34] surrounding
[56:35] areas both your friends and those that
[56:39] aren't your friends what they say you
[56:41] know keep your friends close and your
[56:43] enemies closer feed your enemies do good
[56:47] to them that despitefully use you those
[56:49] are very very good
[56:53] questions let's try and answer them
[56:57] the first question was about years 4,000
[57:01] years how can we be sure what that year
[57:02] might
[57:04] be well let's answer that question and
[57:07] and look at the calendar years now this
[57:10] plus the answer about the Pharaohs is to
[57:11] take about six or seven minutes we have
[57:13] to drill down a little bit please do
[57:15] your best to stay awake um and if you go
[57:19] to sleep please don't snore okay in
[57:22] various civilizations records are often
[57:24] kept by the year the reign of a king
[57:26] like the fifth year of King
[57:28] rehoboam we need to be able to
[57:29] synchronize these dates with our
[57:31] calendar so with that what's the First
[57:34] Resource we should use the Bible so
[57:37] let's turn there it doesn't know about
[57:39] our calendar but it gives us periods
[57:41] between some significant events so we'll
[57:43] start with those in First Kings chapter
[57:47] 6 we read it came to pass in the
[57:50] 480th year after the children of Israel
[57:54] would come out of the land of Egypt know
[57:56] W's Passover The Exodus in the fourth
[57:58] year of Solomon's Reign Over Israel in
[58:01] the month of Z which is the second month
[58:03] that he began to build the house of the
[58:05] Lord the temple so let's try and start
[58:08] to make a little timeline we we'll
[58:10] anchor it with the Exodus the Passover
[58:13] and we know that 480 years later there's
[58:15] a start of the temple construction which
[58:17] is in the fourth year of King
[58:20] Solomon that's nice but there's no
[58:23] surviving records of other places that
[58:26] tell us about either of those events to
[58:28] enable us to synchronize them to
[58:29] anything so is there another statement
[58:32] in the Bible we can turn to that brings
[58:34] us a little closer to the time of Joseph
[58:37] turns out there is Exodus 12 we read the
[58:40] sojourning of the children of Israel the
[58:42] arrival of Jacob and his family who
[58:44] dwelt in Egypt was 430 years came to
[58:48] pass at the end of the 430 years the S
[58:51] same day it came to pass that all the
[58:53] hosts of the Lord went out from the land
[58:55] of Egypt The
[58:57] Exodus so we can add that to our
[59:00] timeline and that's in Joseph's time
[59:02] we'll be seeing that in another lesson
[59:04] or two so we've got 430 years before the
[59:08] Passover is when Jacob Israel the family
[59:11] the enter Egypt 480 years after that
[59:14] Solomon starts building the Temple but
[59:16] we still don't have any event we can
[59:17] align with our calendar at least none
[59:20] that's been discovered yet so let's move
[59:21] a little closer to our time who
[59:23] succeeded Solomon as king of Judah
[59:28] right
[59:30] rabam in the time that Solomon reigned
[59:32] in Jerusalem over all Israel was 40
[59:34] years Solomon slept with his fathers was
[59:37] buried in the city of David his father
[59:39] and rehoboam his son reigned in instead
[59:42] 40 Years of Solomon and then we get rabo
[59:45] from First Kings
[59:47] 11 I use the word Ascend there because
[59:50] that rather than put became king or
[59:53] something that takes up too much space
[59:54] it won't fit you can't read it the text
[59:56] to be too small because most of you
[59:57] don't have binoculars and you sit too
[59:59] far back so this is an event in the
[1:00:02] Bible that corresponds it turns out with
[1:00:05] both secular history and archaeological
[1:00:08] discoveries it it happens this event
[1:00:10] during the reign of rehoboam a pharaoh
[1:00:13] named shank whom the Bible calls shishak
[1:00:16] invaded Judah and Jerusalem First Kings
[1:00:20] 14 it came to pass in the fifth year of
[1:00:23] King Ray oboom that hak king of Egypt
[1:00:26] came up against
[1:00:30] Jerusalem he didn't conquer it shishak
[1:00:33] took away all the Treasures of the house
[1:00:35] of the Lord and the Treasures of the
[1:00:38] King's house raob bomes he took away all
[1:00:40] he took away the shields of gold which
[1:00:42] Solomon had made so rayoo basically
[1:00:45] bribed shishak to leave so this is
[1:00:47] shak's bragging wall in the temple at
[1:00:50] Carnac in modern day Luxor
[1:00:57] that has list his conquest and very
[1:00:59] Victorious campaign into Judah when we
[1:01:01] were there in
[1:01:02] 2021 I asked our guide where is that we
[1:01:05] had some free time so he took hea andah
[1:01:07] to see it it was carved in the temple
[1:01:09] wall after the conquest and during the
[1:01:12] life of this guy so this relief this
[1:01:14] carving in the wall this brag dates to
[1:01:17] the reign of rabo and an event that we
[1:01:21] know in the Bible well let's add this
[1:01:23] event to our
[1:01:24] timeline shishak invades rabam 5 okay so
[1:01:28] the anchor event I've highlighted it in
[1:01:30] yellow in the Bible is the Exodus the
[1:01:35] Passover the anchor event in secular
[1:01:37] history will be
[1:01:39] shak's Invasion so we can figure out
[1:01:43] between Solomon's year four raob blah
[1:01:45] blah blah that we get 41 years then 480
[1:01:48] years then 430 years now there is some
[1:01:51] controversy about whether shishak in the
[1:01:53] Bible is shank in the hog
[1:01:56] but the majority of Scholars who study
[1:01:58] these things are convinced it's the same
[1:02:01] and the year of his campaign into Judah
[1:02:03] is generally agreed to be 925 926 BC on
[1:02:06] our calendar so let's add the
[1:02:10] dates this tells us that The Exodus
[1:02:12] occurred in 1446 BC but more important
[1:02:15] for us Jacob and his family relocated to
[1:02:18] Egypt in
[1:02:19] 1876
[1:02:21] BC that's fairly precise finally let's
[1:02:25] take what we have read or will read in
[1:02:27] Joseph's story and fill in some of the
[1:02:29] rest of the years in Joseph's life using
[1:02:31] 1876 BC as our time
[1:02:35] anchor so Jacob and the family come at
[1:02:38] the end of the second year a famine
[1:02:39] we'll read the famine lasts seven years
[1:02:42] we just read that that's what's going to
[1:02:43] happen there were seven years of bumper
[1:02:45] crops before that Joseph was promoted
[1:02:48] before that first year of Plenty and he
[1:02:49] was 30 years old at that time he was 17
[1:02:52] when he okay we can stop L that's good
[1:02:54] we we we we get it okay so so that's a
[1:02:57] long answer Adam to your to your
[1:02:59] question about dates but it's probably a
[1:03:02] better answer than trust me that's when
[1:03:04] it was
[1:03:06] okay we had another question I Lydia was
[1:03:09] scratching her head back there a little
[1:03:11] bit how can we be sure which Pharaoh had
[1:03:14] the
[1:03:15] dreams of Joseph and interpreted them
[1:03:19] here we're really
[1:03:21] fortunate because Egypt's calendar was
[1:03:24] fairly accurate was 300 65 days but they
[1:03:27] forgot leap year so what happens is
[1:03:29] every four years things slip by a day so
[1:03:32] so spring occurs every four years at a
[1:03:34] different day than it should have and
[1:03:36] over this is an ancient Kingdom that
[1:03:38] goes on for thousands of years so it
[1:03:40] gets really confusing so everything in
[1:03:43] their life depended upon when is a Nile
[1:03:45] going to flood and they they were smart
[1:03:46] people they looked at the sky and they
[1:03:48] figured out that you know there's a star
[1:03:50] serious that's what we call it it's one
[1:03:52] of the brightest objects in the sky and
[1:03:54] they look for a certain relationship of
[1:03:55] of it to the Sun and the dawn the
[1:03:58] technical term of that is called the
[1:04:00] heliacal rising of
[1:04:02] Sirius Sirius down in the corner there
[1:04:05] well okay there's a sighting of this
[1:04:08] event recorded in an ancient document
[1:04:10] that has survived over the Millennia
[1:04:12] it's called the Papyrus Berlin
[1:04:14] 100012 there won't be a test it's okay
[1:04:17] there's only one other such
[1:04:19] sighting in surviving ancient Egyptian
[1:04:22] records which was 400 years later so
[1:04:24] this document is very very special it's
[1:04:27] very rare without boring you further
[1:04:30] with the details it tells us that year
[1:04:33] seven of the reign of seor stret III a
[1:04:37] son of and the successor to soret II was
[1:04:42] in 1871
[1:04:44] BC so let's stick this on our timeline
[1:04:47] along with the length of the reign of
[1:04:49] soret
[1:04:51] 2 and we can see from this that seset 2
[1:04:54] is the pharaoh
[1:04:57] that had the
[1:04:59] dreams and by the way there there's a
[1:05:01] book that was published in 2013 I'm sure
[1:05:04] you all want a copy of this radiocarbon
[1:05:07] in the chronologies of ancient Egypt um
[1:05:11] you'll go to sleep if you have problems
[1:05:13] with insomnia get this book you won't
[1:05:15] make it through the first
[1:05:17] page but there's a very interesting
[1:05:20] statement that they make in there on
[1:05:21] page 27 says the heliacal rising of
[1:05:24] Sirius would have occurred on for peret
[1:05:27] 16 that's an Egyptian calendar reference
[1:05:29] in 1871 BC dating year 7 is Senus to
[1:05:33] that year this is widely considered to
[1:05:37] be the earliest independently verified
[1:05:41] absolute date in recorded
[1:05:44] history and it's in the time of
[1:05:50] Joseph now you might say well that's
[1:05:53] just a coincidence that that this very
[1:05:56] rare document enables us to nail this
[1:05:59] down exactly I don't think that it's a
[1:06:02] coincidence as is normal in Academia
[1:06:04] there are people with different opinions
[1:06:06] there's not 100% agreement about
[1:06:09] this okay enough math and dates go ahead
[1:06:12] and poke your neighbor wake him up okay
[1:06:16] you're awake thank you for not
[1:06:18] snoring the last question that we had
[1:06:20] very insightful question from our sister
[1:06:23] Ava back there in the AV booth she said
[1:06:26] how can a 20% Harvest Feed
[1:06:31] everyone and and feed the neighboring
[1:06:33] areas as well we're not going to do any
[1:06:35] math let's look at some pictures instead
[1:06:39] okay Fastener seat
[1:06:41] bels
[1:06:43] fume in this photo you see modern Egypt
[1:06:46] from space the Nile is that little green
[1:06:50] belt moving up
[1:06:53] there you'll notice because I put a
[1:06:56] bright yellow box around it another
[1:06:58] green area this is a low-lying Oasis or
[1:07:01] lake or Marsh area that's 550 to 650
[1:07:04] square miles in size that's if you had a
[1:07:07] one mile wide thing it would go for
[1:07:10] about 600 miles the length of the Nile
[1:07:14] that they're farming
[1:07:17] right this place is called fiume it's a
[1:07:22] little hard to see let's let's zoom in
[1:07:25] especially in ancient times it could
[1:07:27] potentially produce as much or nearly as
[1:07:30] much wheat as a cultivated part of the
[1:07:32] Nile prior to Joseph's time this was
[1:07:35] just a depression in the desert little
[1:07:37] small Oasis it may have had a little bit
[1:07:40] of seasonal water or L not very
[1:07:44] productive but brother
[1:07:46] ly we just read that Joseph traveled
[1:07:49] throughout Egypt yeah he saw
[1:07:52] fume and he must have thought you know
[1:07:56] if that place had a supply of
[1:07:58] water
[1:08:01] H you see the circle part of the
[1:08:04] picture that's how Joseph got water to
[1:08:09] fume this is one of the first major
[1:08:13] waterwork projects in the entire
[1:08:16] world the canal that ties the fiume
[1:08:18] Basin to the Nile ensuring a reliable
[1:08:21] source of water and soil replenishment
[1:08:23] dates to the reign of senusret 2 history
[1:08:28] gives him credit as the Pharaoh that
[1:08:30] developed this region he engraved it
[1:08:33] over a whole bunch of his little things
[1:08:35] that pharaohs like to brag
[1:08:40] about the canal is named after the
[1:08:44] person who really is responsible to this
[1:08:46] day it's known as baru the canal of
[1:08:51] Joseph it follows a natural path that
[1:08:54] before the canal might allow some water
[1:08:56] from the Nile into that place at Peak
[1:08:58] flooding of the Nile but with the canal
[1:09:01] much more water could be reliably
[1:09:03] diverted there by dramatically
[1:09:05] increasing the area of watered usable
[1:09:08] Farmland Joseph radically increased
[1:09:11] grain production in Egypt during the
[1:09:13] years of plenty perhaps doubled it and
[1:09:17] this probably wasn't taxed at 20% but
[1:09:19] more likely at 100% it belonged to the
[1:09:22] government to Pharaoh under Joseph's
[1:09:24] Direction
[1:09:26] the canal is 9 and 12 miles long and 16t
[1:09:32] deep dug by hand 4,000 years ago
[1:09:37] unprecedented Waterworks projects didn't
[1:09:39] exist back then remember Pharaoh's
[1:09:43] observation Pharaoh said unto Joseph for
[1:09:46] as much as God has showed thee all this
[1:09:48] there's none so discreet and wise as
[1:09:50] you this is an old photo of the canal of
[1:09:53] Joseph and the fume it's not like the
[1:09:55] little Canal you see running through
[1:09:58] Arizona it's not a narrow little
[1:10:01] ditch No 9 and a half miles long 16 feet
[1:10:05] deep you get a sense of how wide it
[1:10:08] was it's an old photo well there's one
[1:10:13] more thing before we get back to our
[1:10:15] story since we're talking about these
[1:10:16] kinds of things remember I said last
[1:10:20] time that uh there was a princess named
[1:10:23] soranet
[1:10:25] named after the goddess hator
[1:10:27] represented by a cow part of the reason
[1:10:30] that soret 2 was so upset by that first
[1:10:33] Dream the starving cows that she had a
[1:10:37] special tomb in s's funerary
[1:10:41] complex well this is a photo and a
[1:10:43] diagram of that complex he had a pyramid
[1:10:46] made for his remains its granite and
[1:10:48] linstone core was covered in mud brick
[1:10:50] not Stone so it's eroded a lot over
[1:10:53] 4,000 years but you can see it was huge
[1:10:57] a lot of mud bricks it's indicated by
[1:11:00] that royal blue arrow in the plan view
[1:11:03] it's the large pyramid you notice
[1:11:05] several small rectangular buildings
[1:11:07] which had the remains of various Nobles
[1:11:09] and family members and stuff near its
[1:11:11] northern end but there's a second
[1:11:14] pyramid smaller than his pointed by the
[1:11:17] red arrow it's the only other pyramid in
[1:11:20] that complex much grander than the other
[1:11:22] buildings this is the special tomb
[1:11:25] of s hator unet where her pectoral
[1:11:29] necklace was
[1:11:31] found and by the way Senus ru's entire
[1:11:35] funerary complex is alongside the Joseph
[1:11:38] Canal at
[1:11:41] fume what a mighty God we
[1:11:44] serve back to our text Genesis 41 and
[1:11:48] unto Joseph were born two sons before
[1:11:50] the years of famine came which azath the
[1:11:53] daughter of pipera priest of own bore
[1:11:55] unto
[1:11:57] him did you ever notice that the names
[1:12:00] of the wives of Jacob's sons the 12
[1:12:03] Patriarchs are not in the Bible two
[1:12:07] exceptions azeneth the wife of
[1:12:10] Joseph and Tamar the the levite wife of
[1:12:14] Judah whom we'll discuss in a later part
[1:12:16] of the Joseph story both are
[1:12:19] Gentiles just like Ruth and Rahab in the
[1:12:21] genealogy of Jesus adopted father
[1:12:25] we don't know the names of any of the
[1:12:27] other
[1:12:29] wives Joseph called the name of his
[1:12:31] firstborn manasse causing to forget for
[1:12:35] he said God hath made me forget all my
[1:12:37] toil and all my father's
[1:12:40] house and the name of the second he
[1:12:42] called ephriam double fruit for God hath
[1:12:46] caused me to be fruitful in the land of
[1:12:49] my
[1:12:51] Affliction and the seven years of
[1:12:53] plenteousness was in the land of Egypt
[1:12:56] were
[1:12:57] ended and the seven years of dir of crop
[1:13:00] failures of famine began to come
[1:13:02] according as Joseph had said and AD
[1:13:05] Earth was in all the surrounding lands
[1:13:07] but in all the land of Egypt there was
[1:13:11] bread when all the land of Egypt was
[1:13:14] famished the people cried to Pharaoh for
[1:13:18] bread and Pharaoh said unto all the
[1:13:21] Egyptians go under
[1:13:23] Joseph what he sayth you
[1:13:27] do another type or model of Christ is
[1:13:31] playing out
[1:13:32] here starving dying in a world of sin go
[1:13:38] to Jesus what he saith to you do not
[1:13:43] just hear repeat do we're getting back
[1:13:47] to
[1:13:47] Genesis what a strange thing for the
[1:13:50] king to
[1:13:51] say in in fact he's saying don't ask me
[1:13:55] Joseph's in charge of all this ask
[1:13:59] him everybody already knew that
[1:14:02] right after all didn't Pharaoh appoint
[1:14:04] Joseph to do this very
[1:14:07] thing maybe
[1:14:10] not let me give you a couple of Clues as
[1:14:14] to what's going on recall we read from
[1:14:17] Psalm 10517 to19 and part two of the
[1:14:20] Joseph story about the Lord sent Joseph
[1:14:22] as a slave to Egypt prior to a famine
[1:14:26] well here are the next three
[1:14:28] verses and the King we know now is
[1:14:31] senusret 2 sent and loose Joseph even
[1:14:34] the ruler of the people and let him go
[1:14:36] free throughout the land of Egypt he
[1:14:39] made him Lord of his house and ruler of
[1:14:42] all his substance just like potier just
[1:14:45] like The Roundhouse Warden the number
[1:14:47] two guy the Chief Operating Officer the
[1:14:49] the vazer as they're sometimes called to
[1:14:52] bind his princes at his pleasure and and
[1:14:55] teaches Senators
[1:14:58] wisdom verse 22 I I scratched my head
[1:15:01] when I read that I don't know if you
[1:15:03] scratch your I mean maybe you scratched
[1:15:05] your hair I don't have hair I have to
[1:15:06] scratch my head the King James
[1:15:08] translation of verse 22 is strange Egypt
[1:15:12] didn't have a senate and why would you
[1:15:14] tie up or confine the pharaoh's
[1:15:17] Sons well we'll go to the NIV a
[1:15:20] different translation and it will
[1:15:21] Enlighten us on verse 22
[1:15:26] to instruct his princes as he pleased
[1:15:30] and teach his Elders wisdom in other
[1:15:33] words Joseph was responsible for
[1:15:36] educating teaching and mentoring
[1:15:37] senusret to's Sons the princes and in a
[1:15:41] future part of our story Joseph when
[1:15:44] talking to his brothers will tell
[1:15:46] them God hath made me a father to
[1:15:49] pharaoh and Lord of all his house and a
[1:15:52] ruler throughout all the land of Egypt
[1:15:56] why would he say
[1:15:57] that that he was fathered a
[1:16:00] pharaoh what's going
[1:16:03] on my turn to ask a question do you
[1:16:07] remember the timeline I showed you a few
[1:16:09] minutes ago with the Pharaohs on it
[1:16:12] those of you that had binoculars or were
[1:16:14] sitting
[1:16:15] close no well let me display it
[1:16:18] again soret to is died and is inside his
[1:16:23] pyramid he died just just as the years
[1:16:25] of plenty ended just as the years of bad
[1:16:28] crops and subsequent famine were
[1:16:31] beginning his son Senus set 3 has
[1:16:33] ascended to the throne of Egypt and is
[1:16:35] now King but he's new at the job he's
[1:16:39] telling the people that just as his
[1:16:40] father had made Joseph the vizer the the
[1:16:43] number two guy he's doing the
[1:16:45] same continuity in the midst of
[1:16:49] Crisis don't ask me ask Joseph the new
[1:16:54] Pharaoh trusts and respects Joseph the
[1:16:56] one who predicted the very famine that
[1:16:58] began with his
[1:17:00] Ascension a good news for seset three
[1:17:03] this means he's not cursed displeasing
[1:17:05] the gods and causing the famine as some
[1:17:07] might think oh your dad died you come to
[1:17:10] the throne we're having bad Harvest we
[1:17:11] need to do something about that no no no
[1:17:14] the famine was predicted seven or eight
[1:17:16] years earlier by Joseph Egypt had been
[1:17:18] preparing for it for seven
[1:17:20] years Gathering grain building granaries
[1:17:23] to store it during the years of the
[1:17:24] bumper crop so Joseph tells his brothers
[1:17:27] that he's like a father to the new
[1:17:29] Pharaoh senior thre 3 the guy that he
[1:17:32] educated the guy that he mentored the
[1:17:35] guy that he
[1:17:37] taught who is really in
[1:17:39] charge Pharaoh Senus 3 is Lord of the
[1:17:46] famine Joseph is Lord of the
[1:17:51] feast in a future lesson if I don't
[1:17:54] forget feel free to remind me I'll share
[1:17:56] with you some additional extra biblical
[1:17:58] information not six or seven minutes
[1:18:00] worth maybe one or two minutes that
[1:18:03] reinforces the timing of the famine and
[1:18:05] the Bible Narrative of Joseph's actions
[1:18:08] by way of some details from history of s
[1:18:12] 3's
[1:18:14] Reign moving
[1:18:16] on the famine was over all the face of
[1:18:19] the Earth Joseph opened all the
[1:18:21] storehouses and sold grain unto the
[1:18:23] Egyptians and the famine waxed sore in
[1:18:27] the land of Egypt and continued and got
[1:18:29] worse and worse and all countries people
[1:18:33] from nearby regions came into Egypt to
[1:18:36] Joseph to buy Grain because the famine
[1:18:39] was so bad in all those
[1:18:43] lands it extended to the land of Canaan
[1:18:47] drought crop failure
[1:18:50] famine
[1:18:52] starvation death
[1:18:56] reading
[1:18:58] on Genesis
[1:19:00] 42 now when Jacob saw when he heard when
[1:19:04] he learned when he understood he's 120
[1:19:07] years old he wasn't traveling around
[1:19:08] looking around much when he saw that
[1:19:11] there was grain available in
[1:19:13] Egypt Jacob said to his
[1:19:18] sons why do you look upon one
[1:19:21] another why are you just standing around
[1:19:24] around staring at each other he said
[1:19:29] behold I have heard that we're out of
[1:19:31] time but the story of my son Joseph will
[1:19:34] continue in two more weeks in it Joseph
[1:19:38] will get one of the most unsettling
[1:19:40] shocks of his entire life you won't want
[1:19:43] to miss part
[1:19:46] five listen to
[1:19:49] Jacob now that Joseph is finally out of
[1:19:52] prison no longer a Slave let's see the
[1:19:55] parallel model or type of Christ his
[1:19:58] life displays thus far the musicians
[1:20:01] would would please
[1:20:03] come Joseph was sent by his father to
[1:20:07] the sons of
[1:20:08] Israel as was
[1:20:14] Jesus they reject him abuse him betray
[1:20:18] him then try to cover their sin before
[1:20:21] their father by the blood of a
[1:20:22] substitute a sacrificial animal a
[1:20:26] kid when Jesus was being crucified and
[1:20:29] his blood was being shed it was exactly
[1:20:32] at the time that the people that were
[1:20:35] responsible for having him in that state
[1:20:37] were doing their morning sacrifice at
[1:20:40] the sacrificial lamb the third hour when
[1:20:44] Jesus finally
[1:20:45] expired six hours later the ninth hour
[1:20:48] is when they were doing another daily
[1:20:51] offering the evening offering of a
[1:20:53] sacrificial animal
[1:20:55] Joseph is sold for silver stripped of
[1:20:58] Glory made a
[1:20:59] servant sounds like Jesus Joseph is
[1:21:03] mistreated tempted falsely accused
[1:21:05] sentenced for sins he did not
[1:21:07] commit as was Jesus But ultimately
[1:21:11] Joseph is raised by command of the
[1:21:13] Divine King restored and
[1:21:16] exalted as was Jesus Joseph began his
[1:21:20] public Ministry at age 30 as did Jesus
[1:21:24] and for what
[1:21:25] purpose to offer salvation and Life to a
[1:21:29] starving and dying world a world that
[1:21:33] didn't yet realize its
[1:21:36] need when the Egyptians recognized their
[1:21:39] need they came to je to Joseph for bread
[1:21:43] when we come to recognize our need we
[1:21:47] come to Jesus who
[1:21:49] said for the bread of God is he which
[1:21:52] cometh down from heaven and giveth life
[1:21:54] unto the world they said unto him Lord
[1:21:56] ever more give us this bread Jesus said
[1:21:59] unto them I am the bread of life he that
[1:22:04] cometh to me shall never
[1:22:07] hunger if there's anyone here that has
[1:22:11] not received salvation through Jesus
[1:22:14] Christ perhaps you think you don't need
[1:22:16] it or him and part because you're living
[1:22:18] in a world of
[1:22:19] Plenty don't miss your time or your
[1:22:22] opportunity to receive him or be
[1:22:25] received by him not to avoid some future
[1:22:28] catastrophe not some sort of fire or
[1:22:30] life insurance but because you recognize
[1:22:33] the sacrifice he made on your behalf
[1:22:36] loving you while you didn't even know
[1:22:38] him or even actively against him an
[1:22:42] enemy we love him why because he first
[1:22:46] loved us our motivation should always be
[1:22:50] based on love not fear
[1:22:54] well let's worship Him in song with make
[1:22:57] me more like thee as we close the
[1:23:02] service make me
