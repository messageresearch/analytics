[14:45] thee
[14:46] if I would declare and speak of them
[14:48] they are more than can be numbered
[14:52] and I had that verse already and it says
[14:54] here we're singing I'd Rather Have Jesus

[36:33] [Music]
[36:41] dearly beloved
[36:43] I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims
[36:47] abstain from fleshly lusts which war
[36:49] against the soul having your
[36:51] conversation honest among the Gentiles
[36:53] that whereas they speak against you as
[36:57] evildoers
[36:58] they may buy your good works which they
[37:02] Shall Behold
[37:03] glorify God in the day of visitation
[37:06] submit yourselves to every ordinance of
[37:09] man for the Lord's sake whether it be to
[37:12] the king as supreme or unto Governors as
[37:15] unto them that are sent by him for the
[37:18] punishment of evildoers
[37:19] and for the praise of them that do well
[37:23] for so is the will of God
[37:25] that with well-doing you may put to
[37:29] silence the ignorance of foolish men
[37:32] as free and not using your Liberty for a
[37:34] cloak of maliciousness
[37:36] but as Servants of God honor all men
[37:38] love the Brotherhood
[37:40] fear God and honor the king let's bow
[37:44] our heads
[37:45] Lord may you add the blessings to the
[37:48] reading of that word
[37:50] father May
[37:52] your anointing be present tonight as I
[37:55] talk about your servants

[37:59] receive something that will give us
[38:02] Direction each life that's here

[38:12] lays before us we ask in Jesus Christ's
[38:15] name amen
[38:18] God bless you all you can take your
[38:20] seats
[38:27] brother Austin I'm sorry for calling you
[38:29] Amos this morning
[38:32] oh yeah yeah
[38:34] Daniel told me he's like Dad you called
[38:38] Austin Amos
[38:41] sorry you know like the peanut gallery
[38:44] you know everybody's I'm thinking about
[38:46] I got that wrong God bless you my friend
[38:49] it's it was good to meet you
[38:51] it's it's an honor
[38:54] um
[38:54] I was talking about talking this morning
[38:58] about this book of Chronicles and
[39:03] how we have first and second Samuel
[39:06] we're first and second Kings they were
[39:08] all four written together by the same
[39:10] author and we have first and second
[39:12] chronicles written by a different author
[39:14] but both talk about the same period of
[39:18] time and they talk about the same people
[39:19] as I said before just different
[39:22] perspectives as we
[39:24] read through those two books I'm reading
[39:27] reading in second chronicles today
[39:31] and um to give a little background as I
[39:34] went over this morning
[39:36] we have Jehoshaphat was a righteous King
[39:39] in Judah as I said this morning that
[39:43] after
[39:44] Solomon came the kingdom split into two
[39:48] we have Judah and we have Israel there
[39:51] was never a good King
[39:53] after
[39:54] Solomon in Israel
[39:57] but there were some good kings that came
[40:00] through in the line of Judah
[40:03] went down to where we have Ahab the king
[40:07] of Israel and we have Jehoshaphat the
[40:10] king of Judah and we know the story I
[40:12] didn't talk about it this morning but we
[40:14] know the story about when Michaela the
[40:17] prophet gave the prophecy about
[40:21] um when zedekiah and a lie or zedekiah
[40:25] and Ahab wanted to go to battle
[40:28] and
[40:30] um the prophet McKay gave the prophecy
[40:32] that you won't even return from this
[40:35] battle that was that was this time and
[40:37] Jehoshaphat he was the king over in
[40:39] Judah at that time
[40:41] so then after Jehoshaphat his son joram
[40:46] took the throne to horm was a evil man
[40:51] he married the wrong girl married Ahab
[40:55] and Jezebel's daughter
[40:57] and um he brought in sin into Judah
[41:02] and the Lord condemned him for doing
[41:06] that he he condemned them with the
[41:08] Prophet Elijah when he wrote a letter to
[41:10] johoram and he he said that that
[41:13] sickness is going to come in it's going
[41:14] to spread through the country and you
[41:17] are going to get sick and you are going
[41:18] to die because of the whoredoms that
[41:20] you've brought in
[41:21] to this country and the idols that
[41:24] you've set before the people
[41:25] so then we see that
[41:29] he died and he and his wife athaliah who
[41:36] was the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel
[41:39] they had a number of sons
[41:42] most of which died one of those sons was
[41:46] a hazia
[41:47] and a hazia
[41:49] he he took the throne and and he was
[41:52] counseled by his evil mother
[41:57] and then eventually a hazia is killed by
[42:01] this man named jehu
[42:04] and once a hazia is killed then athaliah
[42:10] she took the throne
[42:13] and she was
[42:16] as we know a very very evil person
[42:20] and let's let's turn to Second
[42:22] Chronicles and we'll get right back into
[42:25] the word
[42:26] um
[42:28] 22 and we'll start with verse 10.
[42:35] but when athaliah
[42:38] the mother of ahasia
[42:41] saw that her son was dead she arose and
[42:43] destroyed all the seed Royal
[42:46] of the house of Judah
[42:48] again she took the opportunity
[42:51] to take this Kingdom for herself and she
[42:53] killed all the Royal Blood so that there
[42:55] was no heirs if she would not have any
[42:57] competition
[42:59] but g g hashibath the daughter of the
[43:03] king
[43:04] took joash the son of ahasia and stole
[43:07] him from the king's sons that were slain
[43:10] and put him in his and his nurse in a
[43:14] bed chamber
[43:16] so Jehoshaphat the daughter of King
[43:18] johoram the wife of jehoiada the priest
[43:21] for she was a sister of ahasia
[43:24] hid him from athaliah
[43:27] so that she slew him not so this lady
[43:29] Jehoshaphat protected the baby who was
[43:32] the royal seed from athaliah who was
[43:37] purging anyone that could possibly take
[43:39] the throne from her
[43:40] and again we see that Spirit attacking
[43:44] anyone that is a threat when people when
[43:47] many people get into power
[43:51] and he was with them hid in the house of
[43:54] God six years
[43:56] and at the LIE reigned over the land
[44:00] now when joshabeth
[44:03] saved this baby
[44:06] she wasn't thinking of herself
[44:09] because as I said this morning she had a
[44:13] fairly prominent husband in Judah
[44:17] and life probably wasn't so bad
[44:22] but it wasn't to her it wasn't about the
[44:25] quality of life it was about doing the
[44:27] right thing
[44:30] and uh
[44:32] you know I think about
[44:34] today
[44:36] and how we're often faced
[44:38] with things that lay before us and we
[44:41] say are we going to do the right thing
[44:46] and going to rather going to school
[44:48] going to work whatever it might be we're
[44:52] always faced with we're always faced
[44:56] with a choice
[44:58] and that choice we can either take the
[45:01] easy way
[45:03] or we can take the more difficult Road
[45:06] and most of the time that is the right
[45:09] way to do things if we turn in
[45:11] Revelation brother I'm sorry I didn't
[45:12] give you this this scripture but if we
[45:15] turn to Revelation chapter 3 I want to
[45:17] talk about briefly what we see in this
[45:21] age
[45:23] verse number 14 and we're very familiar
[45:26] with this this we know as the laodicean
[45:29] church age
[45:31] and this is the last Church age that we
[45:35] have in history we have we have about 4
[45:39] 000 years of Jewish history that comes
[45:41] through then it comes to Malachi Malachi
[45:44] prophesies that there is going to come a
[45:47] a man that that turns the hearts of the
[45:51] fathers to the children that man came
[45:53] and and make the the Crooked ways
[45:56] straight and that man came in the in the
[45:59] form of John the Baptist
[46:01] then we see this man the Lord Jesus
[46:04] raise up God in flesh
[46:08] introduced by the prophet and
[46:11] he came and redeemed the whole world
[46:14] and then
[46:17] we see after he ascended up on high and
[46:21] after the day of Pentecost and the
[46:24] people went out and they started
[46:25] spreading this gospel that the Messiah
[46:27] had come
[46:29] then we see this time start ticking
[46:33] on the Gentile
[46:37] time there was no Gentile ages before
[46:40] then we see right after Jesus we see
[46:44] Paul and he's going to these different
[46:45] Gentile churches and the gospel is
[46:48] spreading we see the at the very
[46:51] beginning the Ephesian age all the way
[46:54] down through for 2 000 years and then it
[46:57] comes to this last age which is this
[47:00] laodicean age
[47:03] verse 14 it says this and until unto the
[47:06] angel of the Church of the laodiceans
[47:08] right these things say it's the amen the
[47:11] faithful and true witness the beginning
[47:13] of the creation of God
[47:15] I know that works
[47:17] that thou art neither cold nor hot I
[47:21] would that thou were cold or hot so then
[47:24] because Thou Art lukewarm
[47:26] and neither cold nor hot I will spew
[47:29] thee out of my mouth
[47:31] because thou saith I am rich and
[47:34] increased in goods and have need of
[47:36] nothing and know us not that thou art
[47:39] wretched and miserable and poor and
[47:42] blind and naked
[47:45] imagine
[47:48] if Jehoshaphat
[47:51] would have said
[47:52] would have had the same spirit that we
[47:55] see here in this layout to see an age
[47:57] things are good I don't really need
[47:59] anything
[48:00] you know I've got air conditioning I've
[48:02] got a good job
[48:03] everything everything's going fine
[48:07] you know my husband she you know he's
[48:10] he's in a prominent place in the church
[48:13] and
[48:14] you know my kids are good everything
[48:16] everything's good I don't really have
[48:19] need to really get on my knees and pray
[48:23] I don't really have need to make a stand
[48:26] why would I make a stand I don't have to
[48:30] she didn't have to make this stand she
[48:32] didn't have to take put her life in
[48:34] danger
[48:35] but she did
[48:37] and she helped this baby this joash this
[48:42] King this baby king that was being
[48:44] purged she grabbed this baby took it
[48:48] home with the baby's nurse took it home
[48:50] and protected it at her own peril
[48:53] and it says this
[48:55] Verse 18 I counsel thee to buy of me
[48:58] gold try it in the fire
[49:00] that thou mayest be rich in white
[49:02] arraignment that thou mayest be clothed
[49:05] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[49:08] not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[49:10] isav that thou mayest see
[49:14] now listen to this in this laodicean age
[49:17] as many as I love I rebuke and chasten
[49:23] be zealous
[49:25] therefore and repent
[49:28] this is the only age
[49:30] that he says to be zealous because this
[49:34] age has no zeal
[49:37] this age is lazy it's sitting back it's
[49:39] not doing anything you know we're
[49:41] instead of studying our Bibles we're
[49:44] texting each other we're playing on the
[49:45] phones and instead of coming to church
[49:48] we're doing other things we we're busy
[49:51] with work we are not thinking about God
[49:55] enough
[49:56] and right here it says be zealous
[50:00] Jesus is crying out be zealous don't
[50:04] don't forget me
[50:06] you know he says I stand at the door
[50:09] and knock the only only one that he he
[50:12] won't even be let in
[50:15] is because we're too busy with our other
[50:18] things you know I was thinking brother
[50:20] Jeremy set me up
[50:22] a text just now and it really brother
[50:25] Jeremy that was great you mind if I read
[50:28] it I'm going to read it anyways
[50:30] can I get your approval
[50:32] good
[50:34] he sent me a scripture brother Jeremy
[50:37] says this
[50:38] brother Jeremy said let's bring all of
[50:40] those who have left
[50:42] back to church
[50:45] amen and then brother Jeremy gave me a
[50:47] scripture listen to this scripture
[50:49] Isaiah 58 12.
[50:52] and they that shall be of thee shall
[50:55] build the old waste places and they and
[50:58] they that shall be of thee shall build
[51:01] the old waste places Thou shalt raise up
[51:04] the foundations of many generations and
[51:07] thou shalt be called the repairer of the
[51:09] breach the restorer of the paths to
[51:14] dwell in amen let's go out and get those
[51:18] that have left let's go out and
[51:21] encourage those that are down and let's
[51:24] get them back in and say come back in
[51:26] here this place loves you
[51:28] this place has zeal
[51:30] this place believes on Jesus Christ and
[51:34] the power that he has
[51:38] and to do that brother Jeremy we can't
[51:40] just talk about it
[51:42] to do it we can't sit back like the
[51:45] laodiceans and said I'm fine let
[51:47] somebody else do it we have to make the
[51:50] move to do something
[51:52] it's up to us not just one or two people
[51:56] all of us and all of us know people that
[52:01] need it
[52:02] all of us know people that that are
[52:04] hurting
[52:06] that's our job to reach out to them to
[52:09] do something don't just sit back I was
[52:13] and I tell one on myself
[52:15] I was um
[52:17] at the gym I don't know a couple weeks
[52:19] ago
[52:20] and I was I um I get on the treadmill
[52:22] and I usually take I usually
[52:25] take calls and and um
[52:28] and I'm going and and there's a window
[52:31] there
[52:34] and I think I was listening to a tape as
[52:36] I was as I was on there and I'm going
[52:39] and I see and it's in in the Fry's
[52:42] parking lot at Thornydale and tangerine
[52:47] and I see this big tractor trailer
[52:51] it drives in through the parking lot
[52:53] tight
[52:55] and I'm I'm going I'm like wow what's he
[52:58] doing
[52:59] and he drives he drives past the big
[53:01] window there and I'm thinking don't hit
[53:03] my car don't my car and he and he didn't
[53:06] and he stops
[53:08] and then he backs his tractor trailer up
[53:12] and he wants to turn around in this
[53:13] little parking lot
[53:15] and I'm like what what's this guy doing
[53:19] so he he's in the parking lot and he
[53:21] starts to back up and he cranks it
[53:24] around and he he goes and there's a curb
[53:27] there and then there's a big Palo Verde
[53:29] tree giant Palo Verde tree and he just
[53:33] and he's backing up and he he pulls a
[53:36] tractor-trailer around and it's going
[53:38] next to this Palo Verde tree and he just
[53:41] barely scrapes it on on the side of his
[53:46] of his big uh trailer there and he keeps
[53:49] going back and he's trying to turn
[53:50] around
[53:52] and I'm watching them I'm like this guy
[53:55] what is he thinking and I'm going
[53:59] like what what is going on so he pulls
[54:01] around and he he pulls back and he kind
[54:03] of straightens out and he's got about I
[54:06] don't know for me to meet her brother
[54:07] Aaron to pull this big tractor trailer
[54:10] out and he hits the tree a little bit
[54:13] and then he starts wiggling back and
[54:16] forth and I'm watching this thing and
[54:19] then the other old men he's he goes up
[54:22] next to me goes look at this guy
[54:24] I'm like yeah look at this guy and he's
[54:27] going back and forth
[54:29] and he's getting closer and closer to
[54:32] that Palo Verde tree
[54:33] and I see the pilot fruity Street start
[54:35] to move
[54:36] and then and then the people that work
[54:39] in the gym there they come over and
[54:41] we're all looking out this window like
[54:43] this guy's he's nuts back and forth
[54:47] wiggling back and forth getting closer
[54:49] to the tree closer to the tree
[54:53] and I'm like he's gonna knock the tree
[54:54] down
[54:55] he's going to turn a big hole in the
[54:58] side of that trailer
[54:59] back and forth Closer Closer I see I see
[55:04] the tree moving
[55:06] I see the limb sticking out I see the
[55:09] limb break
[55:12] I see a big gash
[55:15] cut through the side of his trailer
[55:19] and he's still wiggling
[55:23] and he starts he just says okay and he
[55:25] just and then he just pulls out and it
[55:27] just goes over the curb knocks the tree
[55:31] all the way over boom
[55:35] you're talking about a peanut gallery
[55:37] and there were
[55:38] there's this guy what is he thinking
[55:41] so he he pulls out hops the curb drives
[55:45] up
[55:46] to Fry's
[55:49] backs in
[55:52] and unloads his gear unloads his cargo
[55:56] so a few of the people from the store
[55:58] came out said he's got to be on drugs
[56:00] he's got to be high he's got to be
[56:01] something they walk up to him
[56:05] and he's shaking and he's a young man
[56:09] and they're like what happened he says I
[56:12] didn't know how he says I just got my
[56:13] license
[56:14] I just got my CDL
[56:16] and
[56:18] he says he says I knocked down that tree
[56:20] and he and he was ready to cry
[56:23] the young man
[56:26] and
[56:27] you know they're standing there and
[56:29] they're like well it's okay you know a
[56:31] big tree is falling down thank goodness
[56:33] didn't land on a car and
[56:36] and I I thought to myself Lord what's
[56:39] the matter with me
[56:42] I sat there and watched this thing
[56:44] unfold for probably 10 minutes
[56:47] making fun of the poor guy
[56:52] and I'm responsible I could have gone
[56:54] out there and said hey brother You're
[56:56] Gonna Knock the tree down pull over this
[56:59] way
[57:00] I could have helped him
[57:02] I could have done something
[57:04] I could have probably saved the poor
[57:06] guy's license
[57:09] it ripped a whole hole in the side of
[57:11] his trailer
[57:13] ah it's like Lord I'm sorry
[57:16] I didn't do something I could have why
[57:21] did I not
[57:22] instead I was just laughing at him
[57:25] and what kind of a Christian is that
[57:28] what kind of a man am I
[57:30] and not doing something
[57:33] oh
[57:35] I felt terrible for that
[57:37] Never Gonna I'm I wanna I always want to
[57:40] do something I look at this man jehoiada
[57:45] and his wife
[57:47] and they see that this child is going to
[57:50] be killed they could have done like I
[57:51] did just stand back and watch the tree
[57:53] fall down
[57:55] but no
[57:56] they did something
[57:59] they risked their lives all I would have
[58:01] had to do is stop my workout my
[58:04] meaningless workout it's not working
[58:06] that good brother Bobby
[58:10] okay
[58:12] I could have stopped
[58:14] I could have walked outside
[58:17] and helped the guy
[58:20] but I didn't
[58:23] and how many of us
[58:25] are in that position
[58:27] how many of us are in that position
[58:28] daily
[58:31] that we can reach out to someone
[58:36] have you ever regretted doing something
[58:40] for someone
[58:42] have you ever regretted reaching out
[58:46] you know
[58:48] no
[58:50] but I have regretted not doing it
[58:53] that poor kid
[58:55] that's my fault
[58:58] that he knocked that tree down
[59:00] and I
[59:02] I read the story
[59:05] about Jehoshaphat and his wife Jehovah
[59:08] I'm sorry jehoiada
[59:10] and his wife
[59:13] and I think there for the Lao is an
[59:16] example
[59:18] there's an example for all of us
[59:21] that we can that this man and this woman
[59:24] put their lives in danger they got this
[59:27] kid they hit him for I don't know what
[59:29] was it six or seven years
[59:32] every day probably worried that this
[59:36] evil woman athalia that her henchmen
[59:39] were going to come knocking at the door
[59:41] give us the baby
[59:44] and I want to cut your heads off too
[59:47] but they did it
[59:49] they did something now today
[59:54] we're not faced
[59:57] here in the United States with death
[1:00:00] if we don't reach out if we don't do
[1:00:02] something
[1:00:05] we're living laodicea
[1:00:07] the the stakes are much lower for us
[1:00:11] but think about the people that we could
[1:00:13] help they're a lot higher
[1:00:15] you know I was talking this morning
[1:00:16] about the guy
[1:00:18] Daniel at the um at the ball game
[1:00:21] the old man he was so happy man he's
[1:00:25] like everybody's here
[1:00:27] you know he's just I remember you I
[1:00:29] remember your grandpa you know with Rod
[1:00:31] had the had the season tickets he's just
[1:00:33] talking he just he just loved having
[1:00:36] Daniel there and he would love the game
[1:00:39] because the team won everything was just
[1:00:42] so good but brother what about your soul
[1:00:49] have we reached out
[1:00:52] have I have I reached out to as many
[1:00:55] people as I can
[1:00:57] you know Jeremy the the text that you
[1:01:00] sent me
[1:01:01] how important it is is that we can reach
[1:01:04] out and restore these people that are
[1:01:07] lost and these are our family members
[1:01:09] these are our friends
[1:01:12] these are people that need it not to
[1:01:14] build the church
[1:01:16] the church isn't going to amount any
[1:01:17] it's a building
[1:01:20] but this body needs us
[1:01:24] Jesus God chose men and women
[1:01:30] he didn't choose as brother Brown said
[1:01:32] he didn't choose a machine that preach
[1:01:34] his gospel
[1:01:35] he chose men and women to reach out
[1:01:39] to those that need it
[1:01:41] and that's what we have to do I never
[1:01:45] ever want to be guilty of watching a man
[1:01:48] like that tear down a tree
[1:01:51] ruin his career Maybe
[1:01:53] Lord let me never be guilty again I
[1:01:57] learned my lesson and I hope that you
[1:01:59] see my faults and my mistakes
[1:02:02] and that you don't make the same one
[1:02:05] so here we have this joita
[1:02:08] and his wife
[1:02:11] and all of their days
[1:02:14] all of the days that this priest lived
[1:02:17] God blessed Judah
[1:02:21] because he was willing to do something
[1:02:23] let's read a little bit about what he
[1:02:25] did
[1:02:27] second chronicles
[1:02:29] 23.
[1:02:36] and in the seventh year
[1:02:39] jehoiada strengthened himself
[1:02:42] I love that
[1:02:45] I don't know exactly what it means
[1:02:48] but I like the wording on that
[1:02:50] is probably he got on his knees and said
[1:02:53] Lord give me strength because we're
[1:02:55] about to do something big
[1:02:58] Lord guide us
[1:03:00] Lord protect us
[1:03:03] and he took the captains of hundreds
[1:03:07] Azariah the son of johoram
[1:03:09] and Ishmael the son of johannan and
[1:03:12] Azariah the son of Obed
[1:03:14] and Messiah the Son of iodide and the
[1:03:17] last effect the son of zikri
[1:03:20] into the Covenant with him
[1:03:25] I wonder how much
[1:03:27] time he spent in prayer
[1:03:30] and we look at these men that he went to
[1:03:33] what were they thinking
[1:03:36] here is this
[1:03:38] man jehoiada
[1:03:41] this priest
[1:03:44] and we're about to take over the entire
[1:03:48] country
[1:03:50] we're about to attack probably the
[1:03:54] biggest witch in the world
[1:03:56] in atalia
[1:03:59] we're going to go after them
[1:04:02] us
[1:04:04] and joette is like yep
[1:04:06] we're gonna do it so these people had to
[1:04:09] make a decision what are they going to
[1:04:12] do
[1:04:16] and they went about in Judah
[1:04:19] and gathered the Levites out of the
[1:04:21] cities of Judah
[1:04:22] and the chief of the fathers of Israel
[1:04:24] and they came to Jerusalem
[1:04:27] and all the congregation made a covenant
[1:04:29] with the king in the house of God
[1:04:31] and he said unto them Behold The King's
[1:04:33] son shall reign
[1:04:37] as the Lord has said of the sons of
[1:04:39] David
[1:04:40] and johada tells us he jehota tells the
[1:04:43] Levites he said surround he said arm
[1:04:46] yourselves surround this this young man
[1:04:50] this King because we're going to bring
[1:04:52] him in and we are going to anoint him
[1:04:54] and Crown Him King
[1:04:56] protect this boy
[1:05:00] he was precious
[1:05:03] so they all followed
[1:05:06] this jehoia is leading
[1:05:10] and I wonder why
[1:05:12] at the light had the power
[1:05:15] she was the queen she was the boss
[1:05:18] why did they follow this man jehoiada
[1:05:22] you know why they followed him I think
[1:05:24] it doesn't say why
[1:05:25] but I think he had their respect
[1:05:29] they may have seen this man's dedication
[1:05:33] to the Lord they may have seen how much
[1:05:36] this man prayed they may have seen how
[1:05:40] much Judah meant to this man
[1:05:44] and these Warriors and these Levites
[1:05:48] they made the decision put their own
[1:05:51] lives at risk
[1:05:53] we're going to go with this priest
[1:05:56] and not with the one that's ruling this
[1:05:58] country
[1:06:03] let's skip down to verse 8.
[1:06:06] so the Levites
[1:06:08] and all Judah did according to all the
[1:06:10] things that jehoiah the priest had
[1:06:12] commanded
[1:06:13] and took every man his men
[1:06:16] that were come in on the Sabbath with
[1:06:19] them that were to go out on the Sabbath
[1:06:22] for jehoiah the priests dismissed not
[1:06:24] the courses
[1:06:26] moreover they still had Church even this
[1:06:29] time
[1:06:30] brother Wilson we're not going to skip
[1:06:32] church no we're going to continue on
[1:06:38] moreover Jehovah the priest delivered to
[1:06:41] the captains of hundred Spears and
[1:06:43] bucklers and shields that had been in
[1:06:46] been King David's which were in the
[1:06:48] house of God
[1:06:50] and he said all the people every man
[1:06:52] having his weapon in his hand from the
[1:06:54] right side of the temple to the left
[1:06:55] side of the temple Along by The Altar
[1:06:58] and by the temple by the king roundabout
[1:07:00] and they brought out the King's son
[1:07:04] and put him and put upon him the crowd
[1:07:07] and gave him the testimony and made him
[1:07:09] King
[1:07:11] and jehoiah and his sons anointed him
[1:07:14] and said God Save the King
[1:07:18] now somehow they kept this from athaliah
[1:07:24] and again
[1:07:26] I see this man jehoiada he must have had
[1:07:30] such a testimony
[1:07:32] with the people
[1:07:34] with them all to risk their lives like
[1:07:36] this
[1:07:38] and they had to ask themselves who are
[1:07:41] we going to trust
[1:07:43] I look
[1:07:44] thousands of years or however long was
[1:07:47] 1500 years later or whatever it was when
[1:07:49] the when the Book of Revelation was
[1:07:51] written
[1:07:52] and I think about
[1:07:53] that laodicean age
[1:07:56] I think how few jehoias we have today
[1:08:00] and how few
[1:08:02] of us
[1:08:04] that are willing to lay down our lives
[1:08:08] willing to draw our swords
[1:08:13] and go forward
[1:08:15] saying Lord I'm going to be a warrior
[1:08:17] I'm going to learn this book
[1:08:19] Whenever there is something Whenever
[1:08:22] there is a battle to fight I'm going to
[1:08:24] be so one with this book I'm going to
[1:08:26] know how to fight it
[1:08:29] now when athaliah
[1:08:31] heard the noise of the people running
[1:08:33] and praising the king she came to the
[1:08:36] people
[1:08:37] into the house of the Lord she was
[1:08:39] expecting probably something a little
[1:08:42] different than what she received
[1:08:46] and she looked and behold the king stood
[1:08:49] at his pillar at the entering Inn and
[1:08:51] the princes and the trumpets by the king
[1:08:54] and all the people of the land rejoiced
[1:08:56] and sounded with trumpets also the
[1:08:59] singers with instruments of music and
[1:09:01] such as taught to sing praise then at
[1:09:05] the Laya rent her clothes and said
[1:09:09] treason
[1:09:11] treason
[1:09:13] I'm the boss
[1:09:15] how dare you
[1:09:18] now look who was the real boss
[1:09:21] then jehoiada the priest brought out the
[1:09:25] captains of hundreds
[1:09:27] that were set over the host and said
[1:09:29] unto them have her forth of the ranges
[1:09:35] and whosoever followeth her let him be
[1:09:39] slain with the sword
[1:09:41] for the priest said slay you're not in
[1:09:43] the house of the Lord
[1:09:46] this evil woman not only met her end
[1:09:49] that day
[1:09:51] but she brought down everyone that
[1:09:53] followed her
[1:09:55] so friends be careful Who Your Friends
[1:09:57] Are
[1:09:59] be careful who you are following
[1:10:04] okay two more verses and then we're
[1:10:08] gonna see who we really follow
[1:10:11] so they laid hands on her
[1:10:14] and when she was come to the entering of
[1:10:17] the horse gate by the King's house they
[1:10:19] slew her there
[1:10:21] now listen to this
[1:10:23] and jehoiada made a covenant
[1:10:25] between him
[1:10:27] and between all the people
[1:10:30] and between the king
[1:10:32] that they should be the Lord's people
[1:10:39] that's who jehoiada wanted these people
[1:10:44] to be loyal to when you see that word
[1:10:47] Lord there
[1:10:48] you'll notice in your King James Bible
[1:10:52] it's written different than all the
[1:10:53] other words it has a capital l and then
[1:10:57] small caps o r d
[1:11:02] it's called the tetragrammatin am I
[1:11:04] right brother Lyle
[1:11:06] that is referring to Jehovah God
[1:11:12] that is referring to the I am that spoke
[1:11:16] to Moses that is referring to the
[1:11:21] Eternal Father
[1:11:22] not a king
[1:11:25] not a ruler but God himself is who that
[1:11:30] is referring to
[1:11:31] their loyalty in Jehovah or jehoiada was
[1:11:36] a great leader he said you'd be loyal to
[1:11:39] God
[1:11:41] then all the people
[1:11:43] now watch
[1:11:45] what this produces
[1:11:47] sure that they took courage too then all
[1:11:49] the people went into the house of Baal
[1:11:51] and break it down and break his altars
[1:11:54] and his images and pieces and slew Matan
[1:11:57] the priest of Baal before the altar
[1:12:00] with the right influence they got rid of
[1:12:02] that sinful living that johoram had
[1:12:05] introduced
[1:12:08] the garbage that johoram
[1:12:12] and ahasia and athalia
[1:12:16] the immorality the the idolatry all of
[1:12:20] that stuff all of a sudden you have you
[1:12:24] start surrendering to God
[1:12:27] the real Jehovah
[1:12:30] then it starts to leave
[1:12:33] and we see here it starts to go they
[1:12:38] started with the idolatry
[1:12:41] Let's uh
[1:12:43] let me read let me just finish it also
[1:12:46] jehoiada appointed the offices of the
[1:12:48] house of the Lord by the hand of the
[1:12:50] priests the Levites whom David had
[1:12:51] distributed in the house of the Lord to
[1:12:54] offer burnt offerings of the Lord as as
[1:12:56] it is written in the law of Moses with
[1:12:59] rejoicing and with singing as it was
[1:13:01] ordained by David they were happy to go
[1:13:04] to church they were excited
[1:13:07] and he set the porters at the gates of
[1:13:09] the house of the Lord that none which
[1:13:11] was unclean in anything should enter in
[1:13:14] and he took the captains of hundreds and
[1:13:17] the Nobles and the governors of the
[1:13:19] people and all the people of the land
[1:13:20] and brought down the king from the house
[1:13:23] of the Lord and they came through the
[1:13:25] high gate into the King's house and set
[1:13:28] the king upon the throne of the Kingdom
[1:13:30] and all the people of the land rejoiced
[1:13:35] and the city was quiet
[1:13:37] after that they had slain athalia with
[1:13:40] the sword
[1:13:43] let's go to uh
[1:13:45] chapter 24. let's just keep on moving
[1:13:47] joash was seven years old when he began
[1:13:51] to reign
[1:13:53] and he reigned 40 years in Jerusalem and
[1:13:57] his mother's name
[1:13:59] also was zibia of Beersheba
[1:14:03] and Joe Ash now this is a very key
[1:14:05] scripture right here
[1:14:09] you know it just blessed me this morning
[1:14:12] when when I walked out and I was
[1:14:14] introducing one of my favorite people in
[1:14:16] the Bible which is this jehoida
[1:14:19] and I talked to brother Lyle and brother
[1:14:21] Lyle said they named their son that name
[1:14:24] I thought I was the only one that knew
[1:14:26] knew about this guy now what did you say
[1:14:29] you had a you had a king
[1:14:34] Samuel a prophet
[1:14:37] second was Josiah the king
[1:14:42] third one was I'm going to say it in
[1:14:43] English jehoida and the priest amen
[1:14:47] you know and so talking with him it just
[1:14:50] it did my heart good this brother's
[1:14:52] testimony has always been encouraging to
[1:14:55] me and it did me good with a while it
[1:14:58] really encouraged my heart I was telling
[1:14:59] I was telling Stephanie and Daniel about
[1:15:02] this as we were coming home like wow
[1:15:05] somebody so much that you named your son
[1:15:08] that that about after this dear person
[1:15:13] very important scripture here 24 2.
[1:15:16] and joash did that which was right in
[1:15:20] the sight of the Lord all the days of
[1:15:22] jehoiada the priest
[1:15:23] now notice the influence
[1:15:26] of jehoiada on joash
[1:15:30] he did that which was right because he
[1:15:32] had a good example
[1:15:35] let's go to verse 6.
[1:15:36] and the king called for jehoiada the
[1:15:39] chief
[1:15:41] and said unto him now the king gets a
[1:15:43] little older here
[1:15:45] and uh he gets married and and um
[1:15:50] remember he's being mentored by this man
[1:15:55] and he sees the church
[1:15:58] and he says hey we got to do something
[1:16:00] about this
[1:16:01] we gotta we gotta rebuild this
[1:16:05] and the king called for jehoiah the
[1:16:07] chief and said unto him why hast thou
[1:16:09] not required of the Levites to bring in
[1:16:12] out of Judah and out of Jerusalem The
[1:16:15] Collection according to the Commandment
[1:16:17] of Moses the servant of the Lord and for
[1:16:19] the congregation of Israel for the
[1:16:21] Tabernacle of witness
[1:16:23] for the sons of athaliah that Wicked
[1:16:26] Woman had broken up the house of God and
[1:16:29] also all the dedicated things of the
[1:16:31] house of the Lord did they bestow upon
[1:16:33] Balaam
[1:16:36] and at the king's commandment they made
[1:16:38] a chest I like this part because I can
[1:16:42] see it back there
[1:16:43] and at the king's commandment they made
[1:16:45] a chest and said it without the gate
[1:16:49] of the house of the Lord
[1:16:51] and they made a proclamation through
[1:16:54] Judah and Jerusalem to bring into the
[1:16:57] Lord The Collection that Moses the
[1:16:59] servant of God had laid upon Israel in
[1:17:03] the wilderness
[1:17:04] and the princes and all the people
[1:17:07] rejoiced
[1:17:10] and brought in and cast into the chest
[1:17:14] until they had made an end
[1:17:17] and it came to pass that at what time
[1:17:20] the chest was brought unto the king's
[1:17:22] office by the hands of the Levi by the
[1:17:24] hand of the Levites and when they saw
[1:17:26] that there was much money the king's
[1:17:29] scribe and high priest officers came and
[1:17:32] emptied the chest and took it and
[1:17:34] carried it to his place again
[1:17:36] thus they did day by day
[1:17:39] and gathered the money in abundance the
[1:17:42] people were excited
[1:17:44] you know they they wanted they had this
[1:17:46] zeal
[1:17:47] that's talked about that lacks in the
[1:17:49] layout of cnh they had this Zeal to do
[1:17:53] something now it may be it may not be a
[1:17:55] monetary donation
[1:17:57] but all of us have a part to play
[1:18:01] so then we when it was all put together
[1:18:06] then they hired these contractors
[1:18:09] to come in if you look at Kings and I'm
[1:18:12] gonna I'll dig on Jehovah just a little
[1:18:14] bit in in Kings
[1:18:17] jehoiah he had kind of had the priests
[1:18:20] you know they were going to do the
[1:18:21] fixing in the building it just didn't
[1:18:23] work
[1:18:25] and and finally the king's like hey
[1:18:27] do this right jehoida so then jehoiah
[1:18:31] hires contractors hires the experts and
[1:18:33] then they rebuilt the church
[1:18:37] Let's uh let's keep going let's go to
[1:18:39] verse 14. and when they had finished it
[1:18:42] they brought the rest of the money
[1:18:43] before the king and jehoiada whereof
[1:18:46] were made Vessels for the house of the
[1:18:48] Lord even the vessels to minister and to
[1:18:50] offer with all and spoons and vessels of
[1:18:53] gold and silver and they offered burnt
[1:18:55] offerings in the house of the Lord
[1:18:57] continually all the days of jehoiada
[1:19:00] wow
[1:19:02] but Jehovah waxed old and was full of
[1:19:05] days when he died
[1:19:07] 130 years old was he when he died
[1:19:10] and they buried him in the city of David
[1:19:12] among the Kings
[1:19:14] because he had done good in Israel both
[1:19:17] toward God and toward his house
[1:19:21] now after the death of jehoiada came the
[1:19:25] princes of Judah and they made obedience
[1:19:28] to the king they paid homage to the king
[1:19:32] then the king hearkened unto them
[1:19:35] now look what happens when the king lost
[1:19:38] the influence of this great man
[1:19:42] they left the house of the Lord God of
[1:19:44] their fathers and served the Groves and
[1:19:46] idols and wrath Came Upon Judah and
[1:19:49] Jerusalem for this trespass
[1:19:52] yet he sent prophets to them to bring
[1:19:55] them again unto the Lord and they
[1:19:57] testified against them but they would
[1:19:59] not give ear
[1:20:01] and the spirit of God Came Upon
[1:20:03] Zechariah the son of jehoiah the priest
[1:20:05] which stood above the people and said
[1:20:07] unto them thus saith God
[1:20:10] why transgressity the Commandments of
[1:20:12] the Lord that ye cannot prosper
[1:20:17] stop right there for a minute
[1:20:19] you transgressed
[1:20:22] the Commandments of God you sin
[1:20:26] you bring an idolatry
[1:20:28] and he says right here
[1:20:31] that you can't Prosper because of that
[1:20:34] you know I I think about
[1:20:39] God wants us
[1:20:43] to be successful I'm not talking
[1:20:45] monetarily
[1:20:47] God wants us to be successful
[1:20:50] he set Adam and Eve in the Garden of
[1:20:53] Eden
[1:20:54] and he built this beautiful place
[1:20:58] and he was you know the Lord must have
[1:21:00] just been happy
[1:21:02] here
[1:21:04] are my two children
[1:21:07] and I just love them so much
[1:21:11] and I placed them in the nicest place on
[1:21:13] Earth
[1:21:14] I gave them everything that they could
[1:21:17] have need of
[1:21:19] and I even warned them
[1:21:22] but watch for this Danger
[1:21:27] you see this tree
[1:21:32] stay away from it
[1:21:36] and what's the first thing that they do
[1:21:38] what tree
[1:21:40] like our kids
[1:21:42] God wants us to succeed
[1:21:45] he wants us to be he wants us to be
[1:21:47] happy in life he wants us to have
[1:21:50] families he wants us to be to have
[1:21:52] enough money to to live our lives and
[1:21:55] not to struggle at any time but then we
[1:21:59] go and we mess it up
[1:22:02] do you ever see a successful drug user
[1:22:06] no
[1:22:08] why do it
[1:22:10] it's only going to hurt you
[1:22:13] why run with the wrong boy or the wrong
[1:22:15] girl it's just going to hurt you
[1:22:18] don't do it
[1:22:21] and we've warn our children God warns us
[1:22:25] and yet we do it
[1:22:27] and it says here
[1:22:30] the son of jehoiada he says you're not
[1:22:34] going to prosper sinning
[1:22:38] where was I at verse verse 20
[1:22:42] verse 20 because you have forsaken the
[1:22:44] Lord he hath also forsaken you
[1:22:50] who made the first move
[1:22:52] because you have forsaken the Lord
[1:22:56] because I have sinned
[1:22:59] the Lord's also forsaken us
[1:23:04] and they conspired against him and
[1:23:06] stoned him with stones
[1:23:08] but they didn't like hearing this
[1:23:10] preacher talked the way he was talking
[1:23:13] and they conspired against him and
[1:23:15] stoned him with stones at the
[1:23:16] Commandment of the king and the corn of
[1:23:18] the court of the house of the Lord
[1:23:20] thus joashed the king remembered not the
[1:23:23] kindness which jehoi to his father had
[1:23:25] done to him but slew his son
[1:23:29] and when he died he said the Lord look
[1:23:32] upon it and require it
[1:23:34] this son of jehoiada
[1:23:37] he cried out for Revenge
[1:23:42] a little foreign to us
[1:23:44] but he did
[1:23:46] he cried out for Revenge
[1:23:50] and I think that probably many of us
[1:23:52] right now
[1:23:54] are thinking of a man that had the Holy
[1:23:57] Ghost and was being stoned
[1:23:59] Stephen
[1:24:01] and he cried out for mercy
[1:24:04] but this is the Old Testament we're
[1:24:06] talking about right now
[1:24:09] and it came to pass at the end of the
[1:24:11] year that the host of Syria came up
[1:24:13] against him and they came to Judah and
[1:24:16] Jerusalem and destroyed all the princes
[1:24:17] of the people from among the people
[1:24:20] and sent all the spoil of them under the
[1:24:23] king of Damascus he's losing everything
[1:24:26] for the army of the syrians came with a
[1:24:28] small company of men and the Lord
[1:24:31] delivered a very great host into their
[1:24:33] hand because they had forsaken the Lord
[1:24:35] God of their fathers so they executed
[1:24:38] judgment against joash
[1:24:41] and when they were departed from him
[1:24:44] for they left him in great diseases
[1:24:46] his own servants conspired against him
[1:24:49] for the blood of the sons of jehoiada
[1:24:51] the priest
[1:24:52] and slew him on his bed and he died
[1:24:56] and they buried him in the city of David
[1:24:58] but they buried him not in the
[1:25:00] supplicers of the king
[1:25:02] but jehoiada not being a king
[1:25:05] he got buried right there
[1:25:08] with the Kings
[1:25:10] notice
[1:25:13] joash returned to the sins of the world
[1:25:17] after
[1:25:18] the Lord took jehoiada
[1:25:23] it was a very very sad story
[1:25:27] and you know we look at the influence
[1:25:29] that jehoiada and his wife had on Judah
[1:25:33] and how this place just prospered
[1:25:35] probably for decades how good life was
[1:25:39] that this man of God
[1:25:42] was there and pointing people in the
[1:25:45] right direction and living this life
[1:25:49] and today
[1:25:52] it doesn't have to be
[1:25:55] Pastor in the pulpit
[1:25:58] it doesn't have to be
[1:26:00] a great priest or it doesn't have to be
[1:26:03] a great leader
[1:26:05] it can be a little Widow sister
[1:26:10] it can be somebody that nobody even
[1:26:12] thinks about
[1:26:14] and yet this person has that same
[1:26:17] calling in their lives
[1:26:19] to seek God
[1:26:22] as jehoiada and his wife
[1:26:26] and praying and asking the Lord and
[1:26:29] doing everything that they can and then
[1:26:31] it's like
[1:26:33] it's like a calm pond
[1:26:36] on a calm day and taking a rock
[1:26:40] throwing it out there and it makes the
[1:26:43] Splash and then the ripples they start
[1:26:45] to go
[1:26:48] and it could be sister Shirley could
[1:26:49] start anywhere
[1:26:51] they could start right there
[1:26:53] and those ripples they spread
[1:26:56] throughout the congregation and then
[1:26:58] that congregation spreads throughout the
[1:27:01] city
[1:27:02] and then that City spreads throughout
[1:27:04] the country and then that country
[1:27:06] spreads throughout the world and we
[1:27:09] leave
[1:27:10] this place finally
[1:27:13] it's never
[1:27:17] friends it could be anybody it could be
[1:27:19] playing your instrument
[1:27:21] it could be whatever gift God has given
[1:27:23] it could be a song
[1:27:24] whatever gift God has given us use that
[1:27:28] gift for his glory
[1:27:31] use that gift like jehoiah did use it
[1:27:35] for the people
[1:27:37] and have an influence
[1:27:41] and never
[1:27:44] something changed
[1:27:47] years hundreds of years
[1:27:50] after jehoiada left
[1:27:53] something changed this man
[1:27:55] God himself
[1:27:57] came down in flesh
[1:28:01] gave his life on the cross
[1:28:06] ascended up on high
[1:28:10] and then sent his Spirit down
[1:28:15] into 120 in the upper room I know I talk
[1:28:18] about it a lot I'm going to preach about
[1:28:19] it I think every sermon I ever preached
[1:28:22] is talk about the Holy Spirit
[1:28:24] it is the most important thing in the
[1:28:28] world
[1:28:29] and here it comes down into these people
[1:28:31] and then they go out and it's no more
[1:28:34] like jehoiada's son
[1:28:36] avenge them now it's Lord have mercy
[1:28:40] on them
[1:28:41] and we see it's starting to spread and
[1:28:44] that love comes in and then it's never
[1:28:47] it is never he's gone too far
[1:28:50] I'm sick of him or she's gone too far
[1:28:53] I'm sick of her
[1:28:55] that may be somebody's child
[1:28:57] they may be somebody's daughter that may
[1:28:59] be somebody's son
[1:29:02] and continue to pray for those people
[1:29:05] brother Jeremy that text that you sent
[1:29:07] me those ones that have gone out bring
[1:29:10] them back it doesn't have to be this
[1:29:13] church
[1:29:14] as Jordan said dedicate them to the Lord
[1:29:19] bring them to Christ
[1:29:23] and it is never impossible
[1:29:27] I don't care what they have done I don't
[1:29:29] care how far that they have sinned it
[1:29:32] doesn't matter Jesus Christ is more than
[1:29:36] able let us just do our jobs let us just
[1:29:41] present it present it in love not
[1:29:44] correction not you're doing wrong and
[1:29:46] this and this and this love
[1:29:49] and then we may see
[1:29:53] something happened like happened with
[1:29:55] this brother jehoiah
[1:29:57] amen the Holy Spirit operating we have
[1:30:02] much more ability today than jehoiah the
[1:30:07] priesthood
[1:30:08] because we are filled with that same
[1:30:11] Spirit of Christ amen if the musicians

[1:38:16] foreign
[1:38:17] [Music]
[1:38:22] I guess Dan told me not to preach so I
[1:38:25] won't do that okay
[1:38:27] he asked me how long I was going to
[1:38:29] preach and I I didn't really know so
[1:38:32] I'll just say what's on your heart
[1:38:36] I appreciate the word today
[1:38:40] but I thought of another story there and
[1:38:42] actually in the second Samuel
[1:38:44] [Music]
[1:38:45] about a guy that was
[1:38:48] he was part of the royal family and
[1:38:50] under Saul Jonathan's son
[1:38:53] I can't even pronounce his name
[1:38:57] but anyway I won't even go there I
[1:38:59] looked at it several times and my my
[1:39:02] lips and my brain won't process it
[1:39:05] [Music]
[1:39:06] but a nurse because all the royal family
[1:39:10] was being killed because that was the
[1:39:13] that's what you did you didn't want any
[1:39:15] competition
[1:39:17] and did you know what churches get into
[1:39:19] that same mode
[1:39:21] because they don't want any competition
[1:39:24] and so this nurse took this this child
[1:39:27] which was John uh Saul's grandson
[1:39:30] Jonathan's son
[1:39:32] and took him
[1:39:33] and fled
[1:39:35] but while she was running to protect him
[1:39:39] because he was the last
[1:39:41] member of the Royal Family
[1:39:43] and trying to protect him she fell
[1:39:47] and and this this boy fell
[1:39:51] and he was lame he was only just a few
[1:39:54] years old and he was lame the rest of
[1:39:57] his life
[1:39:59] just a sad picture and she was trying to
[1:40:02] protect him but yet here he is now he's
[1:40:04] lame
[1:40:06] but then you know this thing of trying
[1:40:08] to destroy competition
[1:40:11] it's not God for him because look look
[1:40:14] look I don't have to make you less than
[1:40:18] I am to make me better than what I am
[1:40:21] you know you know that's not the way it
[1:40:23] works we make him great
[1:40:25] and whatever he wants to do that's just
[1:40:27] fine with me Hallelujah so anyway after
[1:40:31] a period of time
[1:40:32] David
[1:40:33] all of a sudden I want that David Spirit
[1:40:36] In Me
[1:40:37] Lyle I want David's Spirit of me David
[1:40:40] always repented
[1:40:42] always repented I want to always repent
[1:40:45] and so after while David's sitting here
[1:40:48] let me just wonder I said I wonder if
[1:40:49] there's any of the royal
[1:40:52] families still living
[1:40:54] so he kind of made an inquiry
[1:40:57] and see if there wasn't
[1:41:00] finally brought this guy and said yeah
[1:41:01] there's there's Jonathan's son Saul's
[1:41:05] grandson
[1:41:06] he yeah he's uh but he's you know he's
[1:41:11] he's not in good health
[1:41:14] he's um
[1:41:16] he's lame
[1:41:18] [Music]
[1:41:20] go fetch him can you imagine
[1:41:24] when the king's Chariot pulled up in
[1:41:28] front of his house
[1:41:30] he was scared to death yeah amen because
[1:41:32] he knew he was a dead man
[1:41:36] he was already
[1:41:37] a dead dog he said
[1:41:40] but he knew he was he was done for it
[1:41:43] and he thought oh God
[1:41:46] I mean you know here's here's the king's
[1:41:48] chariot
[1:41:49] but looks friend that's what happened to
[1:41:51] you and I
[1:41:51] [Music]
[1:41:53] we thought we were done for it
[1:41:56] but the king's Chariot come our way
[1:42:00] right Hallelujah I see the camels coming
[1:42:04] Hallelujah
[1:42:06] who's on the camel
[1:42:09] Hallelujah this bride is going home my
[1:42:13] friend and so so here here's this
[1:42:16] chariot find they finally finally get
[1:42:19] him to open the door now it took him a
[1:42:21] while to get to the door
[1:42:24] [Music]
[1:42:25] he's crippled the Bible says in both
[1:42:29] feet
[1:42:32] and he's trying to get to the door he
[1:42:34] finally gets there
[1:42:36] oh God
[1:42:38] King
[1:42:40] has requested you come and have an
[1:42:43] audience with him
[1:42:46] oh no they finally persuade him
[1:42:50] can you imagine this guy that is a
[1:42:52] nobody
[1:42:53] he gets comes up on the king's chariot
[1:42:57] he's going alone he said well
[1:42:59] I might as well enjoy this ride
[1:43:02] because I'm fixing I'm fixing it
[1:43:05] they go down
[1:43:07] we all felt that way for him
[1:43:09] some of us have made so many mistakes
[1:43:11] the blunders and
[1:43:14] over and over again
[1:43:16] but it's okay he's still a god of a
[1:43:18] second chance third fourth Hallelujah
[1:43:20] yes he is and so finally they get there
[1:43:24] and
[1:43:26] this guy walks in before the king and
[1:43:29] passed before him and David said get up
