And if you don't know what Children's Bible Hour is, you can ask my kids. They'll tell you all about it. So, for those that don't know, tonight it's children's church. So, we'll have the children come forward. Who do we want to have come up? Asher, you want to lead the way? lead the way. All the kids can come up, sit on the front row.

Ye soldiers of the cross. lift high his royal banner. It must not suffer loss. From victory unto victory his army shall lead till every foe is vanquished and Christ is Lord indeed. Let's sing the first verse again. So, we're going to stand up for Jesus. And when it says soldiers of the cross, we're going to march. And when it says lift the banner, we're going to raise our hands. Okay, boys and children and girls and everyone. Amen. Stand up. Stand up for Jesus.

From victory unto victory, his army shall he lead till every foe is vanquished and Christ is Lord indeed. Amen. Brother Dingwall, would you come just open service with a word of prayer? I don't believe we have any prayer requests this evening. Let's just remember the needs from this morning. Remember service this evening. Amen. God bless you. It's nice to be here. You know, I see all these little kids down. I was principal of a school for a number of years. One of my favorite things to do was go into the kindergarten room, not only because my daughter taught it, but it's always smiling, always happy. Sometimes I'd be in a staff meeting. It'd be people getting a little bit grumpy and you know how adults can be. So I'd look at my watch and say, "Oh man, I'm late for a meeting." And I'd head straight to the kindergarten room because they were all Mr. Dingo. You know, so you know, except you be as little children. That's what that's what that's what the Bible says. The first do is all right if I visit a little bit. the the the first uh devotion I did with the little kids, I was a little nervous, you know, because I was used to being among more adult thing, you know, and and so I went into the Sunday school into the into the kindergarten class to do a devotion once and I I realized I'm a lot taller than they are. Can you imagine if Goliath was your Sunday was your was your preacher? You know, you might be a little intimidated. So, I would take a chair and just sit down here like this. sit down in the chair. And I said to them the first time, I said, "Okay, now just pull all your chairs up and we're going to have a talk. Pretend it's your grandpa. We're going to have a grandpa talk." And when I did that, they pulled their chairs right up till their knees were touching my knees. And then, okay, I'll just back a little child. The innocence of a little child, right? &gt;&gt; So, God, God bless you. Let's pray together. Father, we just bow in your presence today. We just want to thank you for your goodness and your grace toward us, Lord. And we just ask Father that uh the service this evening would not only speak to the little children but the big children, the adults, the seniors. Have your way this evening Lord Jesus. We thank you for your grace in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right, you may be seated this evening. Let's sing the song. He's got the whole world in his hands. Amen. All right.

Says Lurel, one of Lurel's favorite songs. Yes, Jesus loves me. &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus loves me. &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus loves me. The Bible tells me so. One more time. Oh yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me. The Bible tells This is great. Elijah said, "Oh, come on. The Lord's good to us. He's good to us that he he gives us our elders for wisdom and he gives us our youth for enthusiasm. I'm I'm excited to announce a veteran preacher that we have here in the Tucson Tabernacle. He has done this one time before and he did a great job. That is our young brother Elijah. You come up here, brother Elijah Murray. God bless you my friend. Lord, we love you and everyone else loves you. And whenever someone doubts you, but you love them more than doubt. And Whenever they hate you, you do love them more than the doubt. Everything what they do to you, you just love them more than the doubt. And we loved you, Lord. We really do. And I know everybody in this church loves you very much. So would you keep everybody safe in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you have your Can you please turn to Psalms 23? The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. And what I like about that scripture is we don't want to. We don't want because he provides. He provides for us. And the second is, he maketh me lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. And the still waters are cleansing our souls. &gt;&gt; We're being renewed. We're our bodies, our souls, they're getting better as the second he he restore my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his sake's name name's sake. Ye thought I walk through the valley of the shadow of death. I will fear no evil. We will feel no evil. And one time I was scared in my bed because I don't like sleeping in the dark. So I prayed to God for thou are with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thy prepares a table full before me and the presence of my enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil. My cup ruth and ruin and runth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. And I will dwell in the Lord in the house of the Lord forever. And I would like to say this, it was on the my Bible um bookmark that my dad gave me and it's really cool. So it's really short so like for the word of God is alive and powerful. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 4:12. &gt;&gt; Amen. stand here with me for a minute. You did a wonderful job. You were blessing that that psalm has been a strength to to many people for the past 3,000 years. and it was a strength to us and what you said to us and I love the way that you brought it right into your own life. A very very good job and if I had some experience I would have turned my microphone on. Praise the Lord. Elijah did a wonderful job. Let me let me share a little testimony about our former speaker is brother his parents brother Paul and sister Andreanna shared a testimony with me uh about a month almost exactly one month ago and they said that a prophecy was given over Elijah that he would be a boy preacher by the time he was eight years old. Am I right? If that's right, raise your hand with the poll. How old are you, Elijah? He's eight years old. All right. Now, next we have our brother Kenneth Peterson. Brother Kenneth is a young man that has always helped out here at the church. I asked him if he would be willing to give us a few words of encouragement. I asked him a few weeks ago and he was quick to answer yes. Elijah was quick to answer no when I first asked him but persistent but persistence paid off and the Lord's blessed us with with brother Elijah and his ministry. And now we have young Kenneth. And Kenneth is has a sermon with the title of I will let you, brother Kenneth, say your title and then also open your sermon up in prayer. God bless you. &gt;&gt; I might not want to pray. &gt;&gt; I might mess up. Come on. Good evening. Thank you, brother Daniel. The the title of my sermon, the Bible means everything or nothing. Key scripture Matthew 13:16 But blessed are you for you your eyes they see and your ears ears here. The Bible doesn't mean anything to you unless you're a Christian. Bible doesn't really mean anything to you unless you're a Christian. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Samuel 1 135 and six. Wait for them to get it up. &gt;&gt; I never wait for them. &gt;&gt; Well, this time I will. 1 Samuel 13:5. &gt;&gt; Brother Tam, you're awfully slow back there. Verse five. And the people, Philistines, I mean, gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, 30,000 chariots, and 6,000 horsemen. And people as the sand which is on the sea shore and be multitude and they came up and pitched in McMash Eastward from Bea Beth Aan. I used to call that Beth Ava. Ava, if you're here, you're going to about to be embarrassed. I always whenever I thought of it or I heard it because I listened to stuff at from the Bible at night, I thought it sounded like Ava, &gt;&gt; which is Lydia's best friend. &gt;&gt; She couldn't last a month without her. Verse six. When the men of Israel said saw that they were in and a straight and a straight for the people were distressed. Then the people hid in hiding themselves in in caves and in thickle thicket and in rocks and in high places and pits and oh that is in the pits. &gt;&gt; Okay. So now Now, what I want you to do is so now you've read the scripture, okay? And we know that so we know now that the people of Israel, they're in a they're scared and they're hiding and things are really bad. All right? So, what you've just read now, I'm gonna I'll teach you a trick. Now go off of your notes and I want you to tell the story of what happens with Jonathan and who his helper was. Okay? I want you to just tell the story without your notes because you've told me the story before. &gt;&gt; And I'll flip them upside down. &gt;&gt; But I might see through them. &gt;&gt; So I've listened to it several times. I can almost actually memorize it. Dad smiling back there. &gt;&gt; So I am &gt;&gt; My wife does it to me. It's &gt;&gt; I also make kids laugh pretty hard. &gt;&gt; So what So what happened? So everybody's afraid and then then what happens? Who who who steps on? Who is the champion? &gt;&gt; Jonathan and his armor bearer. &gt;&gt; Yes, tell the story. &gt;&gt; So, one day upon a day, Jonathan and his armor bear went to the Philistines. And how they knew to get there was there was a sharp rock on one side and then a sharp rock on another side. One was pushing northward against Gibia and then the other one was pushing southwards against Mcmash. And they went passage and they discovered themselves to the Philistines and they said, well, Jonathan said unto his armor bearer, um, if they say, "Behold Terry until we come down to you, we will stand still in our place and not go up unto them. But if they say, "Come up unto us," then we shall go. And they discovered themselves unto the Philistines, and they and the Philistines answered and said, "Come up unto us." And they went up, and they pretty much defeated them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then afterwards, do you want me to tell the story about like &gt;&gt; what happened? Did everybody get it? Did everybody still run away or did all did all of the Philistines did they get mad and attack the the Israelites or did the Israelites get courage and what what happened after that? Oh, there also was an earthquake which &gt;&gt; added to the confusion and the Philistines started fighting each other and then and then &gt;&gt; so what did the what did the Jews do then? Well, the ones that were with the Philistines that went with them up into the camp, they went to turn with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan. And when the people who had hid heard about this, they also followed hard in the battle too. And the Philistines ran away. Do you want me to tell the story about like the honey and all that and the oath. &gt;&gt; Uh, not not yet. I want you I want you to tell tell So what happened to the battle &gt;&gt; then? &gt;&gt; Who won the battle? &gt;&gt; The Israelites. &gt;&gt; The Israelites. And they won it. Why? &gt;&gt; Because it was kind of like a surprise attack. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And because Jonathan and his armor bearer Did they have courage? Why did they have courage? How did they know to have courage? &gt;&gt; Because God was with them. &gt;&gt; Yes. Because God was with them. Right. So, let me ask you, when you come against something terrible like Jonathan and his armor bearer did, if God is with you, what do you do? Do you have courage or do you run away? I should have courage, but sometimes I run away. &gt;&gt; Praise God. He's an honest preacher. Praise God. Amen. Very, very good story. That's one of my favorite stories in the whole Bible. Very, very good job. &gt;&gt; You want me to finish my notes or no? Last time I read it, Last time I read it in the car, I got a headache. I did &gt;&gt; about a page and a half long. &gt;&gt; Let's let's do this. Let's let's finish with finish your notes right there. &gt;&gt; So, if you're not are a Christian, the Bible will mean everything to you. But if you are not a Christian, the Bible will be like a fairy tale to you. &gt;&gt; Oh, amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So tell me, a fairy tale is just a story that's not true. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So when you read this story about Jonathan and his armor bearer and how the the host of the the the um Israelites, they were afraid and the Philistines were shouting and and the Philistines were were thinking that they were going to win. So do you think that that story is a fairy tale or do you think it's true? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Is it true? &gt;&gt; Yes. So we can read that story and then we can apply it to our lives, right? So tell me and uh one of you all Elijah come on up here and you stand right next to Kenneth there. So tell me &gt;&gt; this story gives you courage. &gt;&gt; Yes. So, when do you need courage to fight for the Lord? Kenneth, I'll ask you first. &gt;&gt; That's a hard question. When we're in temptation, well, we're being tempted like Jesus was. &gt;&gt; And then you can overcome that temptation, right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Elijah, how about you? The question. The question is, you take courage from the Bible. When do you have to have courage? &gt;&gt; When? &gt;&gt; Well, when I would have to have courage. &gt;&gt; I don't know. But &gt;&gt; do you ever get scared? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do you need courage when you're scared? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So then you can go back to the story that Kenneth told about how these two men defeated 20 men up on top of the mountain. &gt;&gt; It was 20 men. &gt;&gt; I think it was &gt;&gt; 20 Philistines, 20 soldiers. Did they do a good job? &gt;&gt; All right, Brother Jordan, uh can you Where's Brother Jordan? Can can you lead uh lead us in one song? And I want all the kids to come up here and uh let's let's gather around here like Brother Kim said. Brother Kim, you said grand. There you are. Grandpa time. I am now a grandpa. &gt;&gt; So we can have grandpa time together. So come on up here. Everybody come up here and let me take this. Can you get that name of Jesus? In the name of Jesus, demons will have to flee. In the name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus. Amen to flee when we come in the name of Jesus. Tell me who can stand before the precious name of Jesus. We have the victory. &gt;&gt; All right, everybody. &gt;&gt; We did last time. Everybody sit down right around here and I'm going to tell a story. Okay? I'm going to tell a story about a young man and I'm going to read the Bible to you and then I'm going to ask you some questions. Okay. Yes. So, so tell me this. &gt;&gt; Ah, I made a mistake. &gt;&gt; All right. So, I'm going to talk about I'm going to talk I'm going to talk about a young preacher. And you know what? I bet you this young preacher liked candy, too. All right. What was my subject this morning? &gt;&gt; Give me some five right there. The sermon on the mount. And what did I talk about this morning that was so important for us all to do? We all have to do it. It's the most important thing in our life. What' you say? Right? Pray. Praying is the most important thing. So there was this man, a great man who you know his name, his name is Paul. Paul believed Jesus. And Paul was teaching a young man how to minister and how to lead a church. Can you think of what this young man's name is? Are you serious? Good job, Timothy. Give Give Caitlyn a hand for getting Timothy. So Paul was teaching this young man and he just loved this young man Timothy so much. And Timothy had a very special mother and he had a very special grandmother. His mother's name was Ununice and his grandmother's name was Lois. And Paul saw that this young man Timothy was so good in the scriptures and he he knew how to pray so well because he had been taught right at home by his mom. So do you see how important it is for us? You know when our parents when they teach us about the Bible when they pray with us it's very very important. All right. So let me let me they do what? They love you very much. Yes they do. Your parents love you more than anyone else in the world does except for the Lord Jesus. Except for the Lord God. Yes. Second Timothy reads like this. And he's writing a letter. This is the apostle Paul writing a letter to Timothy. Okay. So when we open up our Bible, we go towards towards the back. These are letters. These are letters that people saved and people translated them into English for us so that we can read them. So the apostle Paul is writing to this young man who he wants to be a preacher and he's giving him advice. Okay. The apostle Paul says this. He says, "I thank God whom I serve with a pure conscience as my forefathers did as without ceasing I remember you in my prayers night and day." Remember I talked about prayer this morning and the Apostle Paul is saying that I remember you in prayer. So Abraham that this would be like me praying for you and saying Lord I pray that Abraham does well in school. I pray that he's healthy. I pray that he's doing well. Okay. So the Apostle Paul says this that I remember you in my prayers day and night and I greatly desire to see you. So he's writing a letter and he can't he can't see him. They didn't have facetime back there back then. So, he's writing this letter and he says, "I want to come see you." And he says, "I'm mindful of your tears that I that I may be filled with joy when I call to remembrance the genuine faith that is in you which dwelt first." Now, listen close. Which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Ununice. and I am persuaded is in you also. Therefore, I remind you to stir up the gift that is in you through the laying on of my hands. So, what does that mean? The stirring up of the gift that is in you. No, there's a gift that's already inside of you, Caitlyn. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You awaken it. Yes. You're stirring up. What were you gonna say? So let me tell you all of you kids kids here each of you has a gift that is inside of you. All right. And you see how good Kenneth your memory is and how you can quote the Bible so well and and how you you like to hear the Bible and then Elijah and how well you can you can give your love you can project it to the people and how good you are at that and Asher just I can see that you're you're such a compassionate boy and as you grow up you that compassion will go out to other people and all of you has a gift. And here Paul is saying that I want to stir up that gift that's with that's within you. And that's what we're trying to do in church. That's what we try to do in Sunday school. That's what we try to do in children's church. We're trying to stir up the gift that all of you have. And every one of us has a different gift. Okay? Means that that you have something that God wants to use. Therefore, I remind you to stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power. This is really important. Remember Kenneth's story. The armor bearer and Jonathan were not afraid when they when they went up there. And then your psalm that you read, yay that though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear. I will not fear. I will fear no evil for God is with me. Okay. So, how can we be afraid if God's with us? And it says here, for God has not given us a a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind. All right. So, who here has gotten scared at night? You have. You've gotten a You've gotten afraid when when you're in the dark, maybe by yourself. Yeah. Asher says Asher says he's been afraid because there's a big storm. Why were you afraid? You got really terrified one time and for no reason. Kenneth, why? Why were you so you get feelings in your body when you're scared at night? Abraham, do you ever get scared? Get scared of thunder. Chloe. &gt;&gt; So, I've shared it before, but I kind of want to share it again. So, one time we were in the car and it was thundering. I was really kind of really scared. Then my favorite song, Take It All Back, came on and I was not even scared at all. You know, I I have the same testimony. When I was your age, I used to get really afraid of the dark. And when the when the lights go out, I'd always want to go in and jump in bed with mom and dad. But I was I was so afraid. But look what Paul is telling Timothy here. For God has not given us a a spirit of fear. So when you're afraid, remember that doesn't come from God. &gt;&gt; That comes from the enemy. And you should never be afraid. We You know why we should never be afraid? Because of what you said, Elijah, in your in your sermon that I will fear. I will not fear because you are with me. Amen. I will fear no evil because you because thou art with me. But for God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind. All right. So we should never fear. We should never be afraid. Okay. So I read the scriptures. Now &gt;&gt; nope. &gt;&gt; All right. So who wrote the book of second Timothy? You got to raise your hand. Who wrote the book of second Timothy? That's a very good good answer, but nope. Asher. Who wrote the book of second Timothy? Who wrote the letter to Timothy? I was just talking about. &gt;&gt; Good job. Paul. Paul wrote that. All right. Now, next question. What was Timothy's mom's name? You got to raise your hand. Chloe &gt;&gt; Ununice. Good job. What was Timothy's grandma's name? Lois. Right. So then let's see what's another question. Um he said that I stirred up the gift that is within you by laying on of hands. Right. Who hasn't got candy yet? Okay. Then then uh Paul says, "For God has not given us the spirit of &gt;&gt; Asher." Asher, right? God has not given us the spirit of of fear, but of what? Love and &gt;&gt; peace. &gt;&gt; Peace is good. How about &gt;&gt; power? Right. Right. Did everybody get candy? All right. Good job, everybody. You can go back to your seats. Brother Jordan, where are you? I'm going to give it back to you. Should I ask the audience if they want candy if they can answer questions too? You know, when Jesus would preach or when when the elders would preach back in in the biblical days, they would sit down like this and then everybody would would gather around and then they would teach. So, I enjoy sitting I enjoy sitting down. Do you want to tell them what we're going to do, brother Daniel, or you want me to? You want to tell them what we're gonna do on the next song here? &gt;&gt; All right, kids. &gt;&gt; Let me come come on back up here. &gt;&gt; Genesis, come up. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Well, this is all the older kids are going to want this, too. And we'll have to pick some adults. &gt;&gt; Come on up. &gt;&gt; You know, I think that we could we could we could bring Laurel up, too, if she wants. &gt;&gt; She'll like this. &gt;&gt; Yeah, Dan. Even Daniel Jr. can help. Come on, Laurel. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, does anybody know the song This Little Light of Mine? &gt;&gt; Who knows it? &gt;&gt; How does it go? &gt;&gt; This little light of mine. &gt;&gt; All right. So, so when we we we have our lights and and we let our lights shine in Do we have to do we let our lights shine in the daytime? We let our lives shine in the night time, right? &gt;&gt; All right.

Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Good. You know friends, telling that story of Timothy and how Timothy may have been a man maybe Daniel's age and wanting to serve God. And look at why it was so important that the Apostle Paul put his mother, put her name there and her grandmother and how important that home life was on this young man Timothy and what an influence it made on him to where he pastored probably the most advanced church at the time there in Ephesus. So to the parents, the young parents, continue on. Kids doing a great job. Kids like singing. They they like the stories. Elijah and Kenneth did a good job in presenting the word for us. And it's our job to stir up that gift. Whether it be a gift of song, whether it be a gift of ministry, whatever that gift might be, we stir it up within them. And we might use candy to do it, we might use flashlights, we might use stories, but it's imperative that we prepare this next generation for the work to come. Amen. Let's bow our heads. Father, we're grateful, Lord, that you've given us an opportunity, Father, to to present your word to the next generation. And then, Lord, it's so beautiful to see how how they know your word and they're being taught at home. Just Lord, as as it was with Ununice and and her little boy Timothy as he was growing up and she instilled that word into him. And father now we pray that as we move forward in life that Lord that we could stir up the gift that is in these young people not just the young people Lord but the gift of everyone that is in this church father because believe that we all have something to give a gift to give to each other. We thank you. Thank you for brother Jordan, sister Martha, Father, the the gift that's within them that they could stir up these youth and and get them excited about worshiping and excited about your word. Thank you, Lord. Thank you for Brother Kim and his wife visiting us and the visitors that we have here. Lord, we are just grateful. We're grateful that we can call upon the name above all names, the name of Jesus Christ. And Lord, that you would lend your ear down and you would hear us now. Lord, I pray your blessings would rest upon our children. Father, be with them as as they grow up and the teenagers, Lord, be with them and may your hand be upon them and bless them and may they be a light, Father. Not a light of a flashlight, but a light of the gospel shining everywhere they go, whether it be in school or or work or or Father, at the playground, wherever it might be. May they be a light to this dark world. We pray. We love you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; One of the kids. So, we will do it again. The joy of the Lord is my strength and you are all dismissed at this song. I &gt;&gt; I think if we're going to sing this song, um I like to keep the kids coraled. &gt;&gt; Yes. and and it's really fun for us to watch. So, all the kids come up here again &gt;&gt; now. No punching, no hitting, &gt;&gt; no biting, &gt;&gt; there we go. We have Laurel. And no, no squashing babies. All right. &gt;&gt; All right, brother Jordan. &gt;&gt; The joy of the Lord is my strength. The joy of the Lord is my strength. The joy of the Lord is my strength. The joy of the Lord is my strength. He gives me living waters and I thirst no more. He gives me living waters and I thirst no more. He gives me living waters and I thirst no more. The joy of the Lord is my strength. The word of God is nighe even in my mouth. The word of God is n even in thy mouth. The word of God is n even in thy mouth. The joy of the Lord is my strength. He fills my heart with laughter. Aha.
