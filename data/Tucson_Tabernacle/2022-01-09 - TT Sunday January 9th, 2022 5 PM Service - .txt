you glad about that today have you been set free thank god i'm free amen appreciate the grace of god and the mercy to us today let's just stand and open with a word of prayer and i'll ask brother dan evans to come up and do that and then maybe share something in his heart well get your notes i guess amen now that's one sword you do want to you do want to meet personally that's the word of god amen so if you'll come up with an opening prayer and just share with the goodness of the lord amen [Music] god bless you all let's let's go before the lord our lord jesus how grateful we are that we can testify to the many miracles that you've done in each of our lives and father that that we know that there is a god sitting on the throne that that will answer these prayers that we have and we'll make many more testimonies that we will rejoice for an eternity about lord we're thankful for you and father as as we go along in this service we pray that your anointing would come down and that you would anoint the speakers whoever would be giving the testimonies father that that you would bless the congregation with encouragement and father that you would be glorified in all things in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you all you can take your seeds i uh i got one against my brother here i didn't know i was gonna i didn't know he gave me a little bit of warning he says brother dan i might call on you i didn't know i was gonna get to be first and break break the ice um there is no um brother branham said that there is no service that's complete without reading the word of god and as i think about testimonies and and it kind of goes along well with some of you were in the last service i preached here when i was talking about joshua and the stones that joshua excuse me the stones that joshua laid down on the jordan river and he told us he said bring your children back to these stones and when they see these stones piled up tell them what happened in this place tell them that these waters of this jordan river parted and testify of these things and i told some of the things about my family about my both of my grandfathers were on the on the mountain in colorado when brother branham spoke the storm away and i gave that testimony and the testimony of my grandfather evans and the snake bite and and losing the car and the different things and those things are a blessing to us but those things are in the past and those stones that joshua piled up they're just stones they're just rocks to bring our thoughts back to these things that have happened but then i went if you remember i went into the book of peter i believe his first first peter and peter said but you are living stones so we are living testimonies to the glory of god and and and the power that god has with us is that brother david god bless you brother david and sister sharon's good to see you i haven't seen you in a long time it's a nice familiar face um so let's uh let's read the scripture let's go back to the book of peter first peter and uh first first peter and he says and i gotta find it um he says a lot let me see first peter chapter three here we go first peter chapter 3 verse 15 and remember brother branham said that no service is complete without reading the scripture brother abraham said my words were fail but if i can just read the scripture these words here these words will never fail so uh i will testify to this with brother aaron putting me up here today first peter chapter 3 verse 15 but sanctify the lord god in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear so friends we should always be ready why are you such a happy people why is there such hope things get down things we we suffer things why are you always so happy well right here we have peter says be ready to answer that question not having a testimony prepared and not really knowing uh what i would say um i will say that the lord has blessed me he's he's blessed me richly in some of the experiences that i've had and i had had a good job at voice of god recordings i was able to go around the world and uh i was able to speak at many ministers meetings and and many of the ministers that were setting up churches or were wondering what brother branham taught about certain things i was able to to be some of the brothers that were able to speak to these things and and encourage the believers in different parts of the world so i've had and then one of the jobs that i had at voice of god recordings somebody had just been introduced to the message or if someone was struggling with with something that they they had on their heart maybe or if there was marital problems or or um everything from drugs to homosexuality to to um did brother branham fail was he not this prophet that we say he is to to to all of these websites that we see and how they attack the profit those questions mostly would would come to me whether it be people who are walking in or writing in emails or calling so i was able to witness a lot of things so in saying that i'd like to maybe ask the audience that maybe some things that are on your hearts a uh a testimony that that you would like to hear about a certain subject or something that that um maybe is happening in your life or that you would like to see and it could be and friends i've seen it all sometimes i i brother bobby i think about what i got to do at voice of god and i'm so thankful i did but the lord led me to leave and and i feel sometimes i feel like i had such a big ministry i i i was able to be part and it wasn't anything that i did it was because of who i represented it wasn't anything that i earned it was because of who i represented and i was able to to do a lot and now i feel like everything's just shrank down to to like lord i don't even have a role to play but if if i can witness in the grocery store or like i was telling about the gym or wherever i'm at i want to be a light to the world and and we do see fruits and i want to see the fruits i don't want to just witness i don't want to just give out a track i want there to be a living as brother branham said a god with flesh on it there has to be that on the other side of that that's why we can't just give someone a tape generally or we can't just give someone a track there has to be a living stone as i said before there has to be something alive there behind that that has that testimony so in in saying that i have a lot of experience and it's it's because of places that i've been and and what i've seen so maybe from the from the audience give me a subject that uh that maybe that that is that you see around or something on your heart tell me something and i'll uh maybe i've had an experience with it i'm going to call on you if you don't raise your hand somebody give me a give me a subject maybe that's on the heart maybe maybe that would encourage this church somebody brother jordan give me something what would encourage this church a testimony about it could be healing it could be about miracles it could be about following away loved ones it could be about about the the false prophecies that are going on about brother brandon what what would you have on your heart for the jordan i we need to testimony i'm gonna have to we'll have to preach that in another and another subject give me something a testimony that you'd like to hear something about maybe a uh an experienced she came and wanted to be you took her order over to tabernacle um i spoke the first time i spoke here did you share that one i believe about baptism um that's there's quite a few there's uh um there was a uh there was a um i used to a lot of my job like i said a voice of god is is there would be phone calls and and things coming in so i still had to get my normal work done so i would i'd work on the weekends and i drove up to uh to the building to voice of god recordings and um on a weekend and i saw a man and he was sitting by the pond in front and uh i was driving by and and he was just he was sitting on the bank and he was looking at the water and man about my age and i stopped and i i said god bless you brother i said um everything okay and he saw i'm just leaving like i was maybe kicking him out you know kicking him off the property and um i said no no no no i said enjoy yourself i was just wanting to make sure everything was okay and he said he said well brother he says i'm having some trouble with my wife and my son he said they're they're not believers and he said you know he says he says i decided in my heart i'm going to i'm going to serve the lord and i was raised in this message but i never lived it and now i want to live it and he said my wife she doesn't want to take off the pants and put on a dress she doesn't want to stop cutting her hair she doesn't want to stop painting her face and and she doesn't want to she doesn't want to live up to it and i said let's go inside so we uh we went in the building and um any of you have been to voice of god recordings but bobby i know you have many times there's a chapel inside there i said let's go into the chapel and talk so we um we start talking and he tells me basically what i just said and uh i said i said brother how dare you i said how dare you put the pressure on your wife she doesn't know anything you haven't lived this life and i went to the book of first corinthians and i said look it says right here that the unbelieving wife is to be sanctified by the believing husband i said now if we go back to brother braham's message we see that that means that she will see you the life that you live and she will want to be like you it's not first corinthians 11. you do what i say i'm the it says in the bible that that the man is the head of the woman and christ is the heavy man brothers we you know what that never works it's because it's done in the wrong spirit so i really got on it and i said what you need to do i said you go back to your wife you apologize you apologize for being so hard on her and you say i want to live my life for jesus christ and i want you to do it with me and um he did well i didn't hear from him and that's some of the the hardest things but aaron is you'll witness to someone and then you never hear back so and you don't know it's like what happened you really appreciate that leper that that jesus said came back and said thank you even though they all got healed you know a couple of them came back and said thanks and he said you know where the rest of them but he called back about a month later and he said uh he's broke daniel he says he says i want to thank you for what you said he says he says i was sitting on the bank of that lake that pond and he said i had my note written i had a pistol in my car and he said i was going to drive up to henryville and i was going to take my life because there was no hope and when he told me i was thinking man i was really hard on this guy if i hadn't known that i'd probably been a little bit softer but it was what the lord ordained and he said oh and he said by the way can you come down he lived in tennessee drove up to jeffersonville to do it he was in nashville i believe he said he said can you come down and baptize my wife and my son they want to be baptized so it works and then there was a there was another there was a woman that called and and she said same thing she said my husband we met in high school and uh you know he's he's never talked about this branham man and he um he's telling me now he started he started listening to tapes and i guess that he grew up with that when he was young he started listening to tapes and now he wants me to um wear a skirt and stop wearing makeup and he's and and he even read me a quote where this branham man said that i was uh um i can say it brother bram said he said that i was a if i did these things brother brother brahm said it i'm okay in saying it he and he was talking about a female dog in that and and she says she says this is wrong she says how dare you all preach this to these women and how dare this branham man do that and who does he think he is and i said sister i said just a minute i said let me let me give you an example i said you and your husband she was about i think she was in her 40s i said you and your husband you go to the the mall and i said you see this 20 year old girl and she's wearing something that barely covers anything strutting around in front of your husband and i said and your husband looks at her i said what do you think about that girl and she's like well i think that she'd be a you know and i said you think like brother brianna i said sister brother brown's not talking about you i said he's talking about that woman that puts herself out there so that men will look at them i said you just take little pieces of what he said and you throw out the rest and she uh it was a little it was a little bit contentious and i was like well i did my best and she calls back i don't know if it's a month or a year later or whatever it is she said i just wanted to tell you i want to say thank you for taking the time that you spent on me on the phone she said my husband and i are now we now go to church and i'm listening to brother branham and i understand now his spirit and it wasn't a spirit of condemnation it was a spirit of love i don't know where they are today but that was probably six seven years ago but i assume that they're serving the lord because she seemed different um is that the testimony was it a different one oh yeah sister tammy um she uh she she was standing on the street corner and somebody walked up to her and she was crying somebody walked up to her and uh she um they gave her a track and it was one of our tracks i think it was jesus christ the same yesterday than whatever one of the newer tracks the voice of god does and she turned it over and there was a phone number there and her husband had left her her son was strung out and she's about to be kicked out of her house and she um just called and she was so upset and uh bless her heart i felt so bad for her and she told me all these things and we prayed and and i sent her two cds i sent her how the angel came to me and life no i sent her be certain of god and life's story was the two cds i sent her and she listened to him she called back a little while later she said hey you got any more of those cds she says you know i'd like to hear some more of them um so uh senator moore to make a long story short this happened over about a year's time she she says i want to be baptized so she comes down to be baptized and i didn't actually baptize her it was some of the brothers that baptized the tabernacle she got baptized stayed with it years passed maybe one or maybe two or three years passed and she called me up and she said brother daniel she says i wanted to wait but i want to give you a testimony she says i've smoked cigarettes since i was 14 years old and she says i've never been able to quit i've tried and tried and she's she's actually exactly my age her birthday's the same as mine born in the same year and um she said i've smoked since i was 14 she says i've been trying to quit for 20 years she said i've tried hypnosis and patch and all these different things i've tried to quit smoking and i've never been able to she said you remember the first cd that you sent me and i said well it was probably be certain of god and life story she said life story she said i was listening to that sermon and she said brother branham was on a date with a girl and she lit up a cigarette and she said it disgusted him and she said from that moment that i heard him say that on tape she said the very smell of smoke disgusts me and she said i quit at that moment and if any of you know have ever known somebody that is hooked on cigarettes it's an addiction boy it's rough and i talked to her not too long before i left voice of god and she was still serving the lord she moved down to florida and still serving the lord and i said have you ever had a craving since then she says not not one so he is he is he's still he is still on the throne um maybe one more testimony i just need to think of it let me uh let's see how about um i have i have um yeah a lot of them um what part of the world africa um the african people are are precious they're um they're they're an incredible they love the lord more than anything in the world i'll give two testimonies i'll start in africa there was a there's a man his name as he attends brother brad burgess's church in louisville his name is willie uh do you know brother willie have you ever met him brother jordan he uh he stephanie you've met him the brother that i always see after church and he's the african brother he was in a um refugee camp in congo and uh he was a christian and and he would he would pray and um he walked into the jungle one day to pray and uh when he walks out there was a man standing there and this man he says this and if you if you know congolese if you've ever dealt with the french africans they're very direct and he says this this man that was standing when he came out from praying he says you pray wrong and he says what he says yeah you pray wrong i was listening to you he says you pray in the name of the father and of the son of the holy ghost he said those are titles they're not even a name he said you need to pray in the name of jesus christ he says okay um you know how do you know that so so he starts talking to him he starts witnessing about brother branham's message to him well brother willie ends up giving his heart to the lord and there was a man that ran the refugee camp he had a swimming pool and and uh the the brother that um witnessed to him baptized him in the swimming pool well he was a refugee so he ultimately wanted to get to the united states well he wanted to go to jeffersonville with all of his heart he wanted to be this place jeffersonville where the prophet was so he uh he finally got his visa to come to the united states he was excited boy he was he was ready to go and and but he as soon as he gets to the united states he's going to buy a train ticket or or a plane ticket or something and come to this little place called jeffersonville so he's relocated this unknown city by the name of louisville kentucky he arrives and little did he know that jeffersonville was right across the river from him and he he began attending the branham tabernacle and he is today a witness of god's grace he was i believe he was stabbed while he was in the refugee camp and it started a cancer and this man that had led him to the lord prayed for him and the cancer was healed brother jordan next time you go to louisville talk to brother willie and have brother willie give you his testimony it's tremendous um one more i'll give one more testimony and this is from a a muslim country um what's that country called indonesia um we were there and we had a minister's meeting and this sweet minister um we opened up the uh the forum to questions and uh this old brother precious old brother had the nicest spirit he um he asked the question and he said with what voice of god teaches and what i've heard he says you teach that we should not preach and he said you teach that that there's that we should just play tapes he said brother he said god called me to be an evangelist he said he called me to preach this gospel and he says i've been successful i've been successful in starting churches i've been successful in bringing people in he says how can i feel that same calling and be wrong and uh i told him and remember i was representing voice of god recordings and i believe that this still is the case for the bobby i really do that that i said i said brother i said if god has called you to do something then you do it if he has called you to preach the gospel preach the gospel we're just here trying to get you to listen to some of these tapes that mean so much to us but if god has called you to preach the gospel and preach the gospel go out and win souls to christ these churches that are listening to these tapes would not have people in their congregation if it wasn't for these evangelists going out and winning souls to christ and i told him brother do it go out there and and the brother was so torn and when he left he was almost walking on air and and i assume that he's still he's still preaching the gospel i could stay up here all day but i want i i we read these testimonies and i talked about joshua in these stones and we um we read these testimonies that are in the bible that brother branham tells us and they have a two-fold purpose we look at the woman at the well for evangelism how she came to know christ by by the lord jesus's witness we look at the eunuch out in the desert and how philip went out to him and he witnessed he said he said what are you reading there you know who what he was reading he's reading the book of isaiah and he said what are you reading there and he says well is he speaking is the prophet speaking of himself or somebody else and then philip knew this book well enough to witness you know so often we say oh you know reading your bible is not important it is important because what if you're put on the stand before a person like peter said you got to be ready to give a testimony so what if we're there so so we read these testimonies we read these these things that have happened in the bible and they're a blessing to us just like me here giving testimonies to you it's a blessing to me but i hope it's a blessing to you peter um brother branham preached a sermon called i believe his testimony on the sea and he said that that the disciples were in the boat and peter was there and jesus wasn't there and john and james and they put their they brought their oars in they just started testifying and it was i believe it was brother bram says john and he started giving testimonies about the lord jesus and then peter he couldn't stand it he wanted to give his testimony and these testimonies that we're here we want to give testimonies but they're also a two-fold purpose thank god that these testimonies are written in this bible and they're and they're recorded on tape that we can hear them too and we can be blessed to and that we can apply them to our lives and friends the testimonies that i give they're meaningless unless we can apply them to our own lives they're just dead stones but if we can apply them that makes them alive and i i'm looking forward to hearing some others the ice is now broken so i i want to hear some some of you also god god bless you thank you brother amen amen i'll share something with you brother dan i got a phone call somebody questioning about you and they said was he trying to take us back to just the tapes i go did not you hear the last scripture he used you are living stones and he came and remind us we're the testimony that he uses today a living testimony amen let's talk about jesus the king of kings is he let's talk about jesus [Music] the great [Applause] [Music] let's talk about jesus sister that if you're talk ready jesus the prince of jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] such tandem [Music] hold on for a minute happy birthday to you happy birthday to you brother peter said i could [Music] happy birthday to you so you can go after him [Applause] um god bless you all um i've sung this song here before but lately it's just been i can't get it off my heart and i pray that it can be a blessing to someone [Music] of the cliff of despair and i don't know why but i didn't care just before i fell someone reached out their heads is [Music] oh he is your best friend when you don't know what to do [Music] and when you think you've had it worse [Music] when you don't know what to [Music] and there have been time when i thought i was through i was so long i didn't know what to do but then i just remembered all those times he brought me out he's drawn me to his side so when you're running out of [Music] oh he is [Music] and when you think you've had it worse [Music] when you don't know what to do is [Music] jesus is he's [Music] jesus [Music] is [Music] amen when you realize in him is everything you have need of and he's out i'll take him amen and he said come unto me he said all you that are heavy laden and i will give you rest amen brother john brother john has come down from alaska and he's been with us and the other day we mentioned and about him maybe greeting the folks giving a little testimony so he said he would and somebody broke the eyes so i know that from alaska you know have no idea what ice says bless you thank you yeah my wife and i were talking earlier about uh being nervous and she's like you're you're in front of god's people and you're speaking to the church you have to be perfect and i'm like well the the onus isn't on me to be perfect that's on the lord so that's where my perfection rests and it's a little easy and they don't have to break the ice or even worry about it but i saw the scripture on the board as we were coming in this evening that said it was the 23rd psalm the lord is my shepherd i shall not want and that's so simple and powerful when you're looking at it and you you read that and you're like yes and then the very next breath you blink and you look at your bills and and how things are stressful in your life and it goes away you know but if we would just stay focused on that that's that's i mean that is the truth i shall not want and and we've been in situations in our life we've been pretty poor a couple of times been homeless a couple of times and one of the neatest testimonies that i've enjoyed was uh shortly after we got married and we were pretty poor we were making about 18 000 a year so that's below the poverty threshold and trying to get by and we were saving up money to go on a trip we wanted to travel through southeast asia and see a bunch of the countries there and we were trying to save up money for that making i don't know a little over a thousand a month maybe 1200 a month or something like that and and tracy's nephew lived in oregon at the time and she really wanted to go see him so she just prayed that the lord would get us to go and see her nephew and then just she actually kind of forgot about it and moved on but god is good and he cares about us even these little things you know just this i was 22 at the time she was 19. just a couple of kids from alaska and my dad called us up and he's been an airplane mechanic for his full career so he's got a bunch of connections and he said hey my buddy's flying a plane down here with nothing on it and then flying it back a week later do you guys want to come down my dad lived in a little town about three hours away from her nephew and so we're like yeah let's do that and this this plane that the guy was flying down is a learjet and we were the only people on it and so we showed up at the airport and i don't know if any of you have ridden a private jet before but there's no security there's no boarding time you just show up and shake the pilot's hand and you walk out onto the ramp and get on the plane and fly wherever you want to go so we were dirt poor and just a couple of kids and i mean on the simple prayer of man i want to go see my nephew the lord gave us a private jet and that's something that i can hold on to ever since then that i mean he's there and he provides a situation we're at right now in our life we've we've been a lot richer than that since then i got hired in a full-time fire department and went through the ranks i promoted i was pretty good at my job and but you know we've got to a point where it was well there's a lot of good things and a lot of bad things and in the eyes of the world working this job i was i had it made i was successful in my career at the apex of the career people all across the country doing what i did wanted to be where i was and i was driving fire trucks making 120 000 a year and i worked pretty hard i got on the promotion list to captain and a little over a year ago when we left when we quit that job and moved down here i was third in line for promotion so within probably a month or a month and a half i would have promoted a captain and that's another two percent or ten percent raise so i'd be making 132 000 a year then and been in charge of a fire station running a crew i could have built a crew of the guys that i liked around me and had a pretty good life but i believe the lord was moving us out of that and if you go back a little further in my life i got saved when i was 15. so that's 20 years ago now i'm 35 and since that time i mean i've always wanted to serve the lord i've wanted to do missionary work i've gone overseas i've sent people overseas all that stuff but there's only one soul that i know that i've led to christ and 20 years time i've got one person to show for it you know and i just wanted to read a scripture here and i'll read it off my phone because i'm of that generation but this is in luke 13 verse 6 it says he spake also this parable a certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came and sought fruit thereon and found none then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard behold these three years i come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none cut it down white cumberth hit the ground and he answering said unto him lord let it alone this year also till i shall dig about it and dung it and if it bear fruit well and if not then after that shalt thou cut it down and you know that's that fruit tree or that fig tree is me um and i don't know i mean i know that the lord gave me my job and my career there and i don't know why i've been 20 years there without leading anybody to christ but but cut around me and put dung on me and make me fruitful and that's my prayer and we got to a kind of a low point in our happiness in our life and started reassessing things and kind of looking at our priorities in life and we're like why do we live in alaska you know we don't do the things that we love there the only thing we have there is the church and the people that we love and it was basically because i had a really good job there and i'm like if i write down my list of priorities my job isn't even on it and so we quit and right now we're just trying to build a life around serving god being together and being healthy and those are some things we didn't have a year and a half ago the servant god we've always done but we just want to be in service for the lord and be fruitful and i just encourage you guys to do that too and i know that the lord will provide the rest for us thank you god bless you [Applause] it's nice to hear someone just speak honest words isn't it amen you know you desire something good and god allows that to be amen you were uh playing that song i sing praises to your name [Music] foreign [Music] oh [Music] one more time [Music] is [Music] and greatly to be i sing praises to your name [Music] oh [Music] to be praised [Music] amen [Music] the golf that separates me from christ my lord it was so vast the crossing [Music] his domain it seemed so fun [Music] i cried dear lord i cannot come to where you are he came to me he came to me when i could not come to where he was he came to me that's why he died when i could not come to where he was he came to me he came to me when i was bound came to me when i possessed no hope with him [Music] where [Music] today it is [Music] [Applause] [Music] he came to me when i could not come to where he was he came to me [Music] when i could not come to where he was he came to me [Music] that's why he died [Music] when i could not come to where he was he came to me [Music] oh he became me so that i might become him [Music] he became me so that i might become [Music] he took my place [Music] one more time he became me so that i might be coming by he became me so that i might become him my grace he took my place [Music] him that he would step down this low so they could be touched and understand what it was like so that we could come up to his level he says come unto me all you that are heavy laden now i will give you rest amen brother jeremy has asked for time to share how the lord gave him the holy ghost how many here can say i know god has filled me with the holy ghost and if you want to be honest and say lord fill me even more hold hands stay fill me to the uttermost amen bless you brother good evening i tend to be nervous so breaking the ice didn't help but we're gonna go to second peter 1 20 and i have a newer bible so it's harder to flip pages and i think i left my phone down yonder so even though i'm new age we'll stick to the reading of the word from the word or i might just read it from the screen since they have it up knowing first um first peter 1 20 and 21 knowing first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation and for the prophecy came not in the old time by the will of man but the holy men of god spake they as they were moved by the holy ghost and um i uh one of my best friends is a philip grant he's moved on to ohio back to ohio but for a time the sister grant came out here and they had a big family and we were really good friends and there came a year and i was baptized when i was 16 i gave my heart to the lord when i was 13 at louisiana camp and i was baptized in six when i was 16 and then um receiving the holy ghost i kind of came to a point in my life that lord when when is it my turn i knew something was missing and i was at a camp meeting and anyways i brought philip grant in the picture because i told him in 2005 the lord was coming and he's like how do you know the lord's coming i don't know i just know and three days before 2006 i received the holy ghost and i was from the sea it was a i i didn't get up and testify about it because i had never heard anyone else give a testimony of that messiah sign being done with them they just simply said i received the holy ghost and they didn't really have a explanation of it and i listened to tapes and brother branham says if you have a testimony you should find it in the word of god and so i i've told them since that you know god came from me in 2005. i didn't know it was for me but it was um brother brown also say it's in ii peter 1 10 is give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall and um i was sitting in the back of the um in winter youth retreat in the old camp i think it was called um it was a nazarene camp before they moved it to fahallah which is faith hope and love but brother ron spencer was ministering and i don't know what he was ministering on because i was in the back and i was in this turmoil we sing that song my chains are gone i've been set free and i was having one of those moments where i was reaching out to god and i was in a moment to myself and i had said something in my mind that you know if i can see everyone else is being blessed by you lord but when is it my turn and i said simply that okay well i'll i'll go out and i'll do my own thing and do this and from the pulpit the ron was like a blood curdling no and god said through him what i said in my mind backwards he said you will live for me and serve me and so i said okay well i need a confirmation because you know i uh i was hiking up in prescott once and uh there's things that people say to you all the time um as you're walking with others that are christian-like and we came to a stream and everyone was thirsty and my cousin went down on his belly and started drinking and i thought that sound that looks really silly and i went down on one knee and i started scooping water and brother russell wall said a gideon night and soon as he said that my cousin got up and got on one knee and started drinking water and but you know and and either way wasn't any better because i tried my cousin's way but you know at the moment i was doing what a gideon night would have been doing one of the 300 that god would have called and and so i waded through the line of 45 minutes and and uh and went up to brother ron and he stuck his hand on my chest like he did just recently because i i really needed i was struggling in my faith because i um i struggle at home the most because we i'm married and we've been barren for so long and we have promises and uh and i have confirmation and clouds and sky and um those are two testimonies maybe i'll get to them but um brother ron said he wants your holy ghost i said i ask for leadership and he wants your holy ghost and i closed my eyes and i was in a room of pure light and uh brother aaron mcgeary was up there and brother ron and they were both pillars of light and brother aaron like normally if you close your eyes even in any situation any time you pass over your eyes it makes a shadow and there was no shadow and so my first scripture that i found in the scripture that compared to that was uh james 1 um 17 and 17 18 is read together is good but in the scriptures because we're brother branham tells us that we're we're we're part of christ he gave us a portion of himself and we're many member bride and so when you take a part of the scriptures you're just taking the part that's real to you and it says with whom which is christ is no variableness neither shadow of turning um but that's that's good so i always ask for confirmation i come to church for confirmation and correction because like the bible says if you say you're not a sinner you lie and it's it's it's rough because you're you're a two-part person and the best way to explain it is in the scriptures it says that you don't let the right hand know what you're left meaning and it's not you separate your ways between your wife and your husband and all that other stuff like a lot of people say but if you're a two-part person and everyone sees this person and knows this person is going to fall all the time but this person behind you influences you is your control tower and um and and i uh i just think it's it's a wonderful thing that if i don't know if the brothers can pull up that picture of brother brown standing and the pillar of fire is behind but brother um brother uh i think it was lonnie jenkins he uh went into astute thing he used a projector with um a transforming our transparent kit and he had drawn over the image and brother branham talked to brother sydney jackson from africa and said do you see that thing behind me he said that's my influencer when in and and he says that that the um when the holy ghost comes in you the the sin that you used to not that one it's um it's it's when the holy ghost is all around the pulpit what is it dad the the lilies of the flowers i wish i had the clip i had a i had a down moment in my life and uh i deleted like 30 gigs off my phone and i started all over collecting pictures again but um it's a really neat testimony yeah that is it and yeah yeah so let's hear off on youtube all right so this little image here and how the hair comes down like this where the branham says my influencer looks like um my mom was a a riverwoman indian and that's how it was displayed the holy ghost let it take a picture of that lens and he said when you receive the holy ghost your influencer comes back here and it only can tap you and that says that's there all the time and it always tells me to do so other things it tells you to do other things but you you can choose to resist it so when you have the holy ghost that's why you have so much trouble you have thoughts going in when i was trying to prepare for this sermon i was at a at a food restaurant and every time i read a scripture some other thing popped up and i was like no we're not we're gonna stay on the testimony and um yeah it's it's it's a wonderful thing to know god um but when we were in transition me and my wife two two testimonies that you know god builds you he builds you into the perfect person of jesus christ and he adds not so much adds to you or takes from the word or adds to it but he gives you enough information to see it in a better light and make it more simple and i was just sitting at a breakfast table i was renting from my grandparents and basically i asked god a spiritual question for a physical need because he had told us that we would get the house we wanted but we were searching for a whole year and we didn't know what it is so i just simply asked him lord will you show us things and i was praying over food and i said in the name of lord jesus christ two days later someone texted me and this person she didn't know me from adam we had this conversation back and forth she thought i was her cousin jeremy and and i was like how'd you get my number all this other stuff but she said why are you caught i asked her why are you contacting me and she said jesus wants you to look up jeremiah 33 3 and so two days later well god does a lot of things in two days or two two's always two witnesses two or three let things be established in two or three i believe it's matthew wrote it down matthew 18 16. and um but um said everything be established in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established yeah that's good and then um so ang ange had that little visitation up in this chapel room and we all heard her testimony um of this five things there was six but we omitted one because we're told it was wisdom um but she had asked me 15 months later like what god works on both sides it's like and she wanted to hurry she wanted the children to come and and the children are coming because god's word doesn't fail and i so i asked god a simple question like that and two days later the cloud picture came up and um i don't have that i don't know if it's it's saved in the email or not but um it was just it was just present day like manna that you know we serve a god and i asked god about whatever you want to do whether it's a sign in heaven or something like that and a lot of people said oh you asked for a sign you know the scripture comes up that everyone that asked for a sign is a wicked an adulterous nation and and i said well brother brown said there's a difference in asking for a sign and recognizing your sign so we're we're in the midst of a vision and uh you just just keep us in prayer angela decided to stay home tonight and um she like brother dan said to brother aaron i got one on you she she does not like to be the center of attention so if you can keep that in your mindset you can bring me up in any sermon you want but if you could leave my wife out of it i would greatly appreciate it i trust these words are are good god bless you i love you my brother no i do i love you thank you sometimes when you get behind the pulpit you have to preach and god lays it on your heart and and you surrender and you minister but you don't know what it took to get to that point when you look at yourself and you say man i don't even match that but you have to minister it and then god will answer again today a brother walking in to the church and he said that song take david at the altar he said that minister to me today you don't know what somebody's saying what somebody's doing he's going to reach into somebody's heart and god is going to minister i just brother jeremy and sister angel is part of this congregation pray for them love them be christians i need it just as much as anybody else i have to face myself every day and there are times that i say lord how can you put up with me you know what he says because i love you and i appreciate that today how many loves the lord jesus i said how many loves the lord jesus amen how many loves your brother and sister okay that's the greatest proof we have today amen let's just sing that leave all your needs or take all your needs i have many interpretations of many songs bring home [Music] is [Music] one more time maybe if you want to stand up [Music] bring all your needs to is [Music] amen you may be seated sister irma if you would come up and make ready to sing this coming week we know we're harmony here at uh at tucson tabernacle and folks coming in from different places and we had a little preview of what it is when people get together and worship the lord with all their heart with all their mind with all their soul and all that let's come with a good attitude let's come with attitude say lord minister help me to enter into worship help me be part of that amen god bless you sister [Music] my sister and i used to sing this song together and i lost her not too long ago so i'm going to do this for the lord and for remembering her too we would sing and say do it and she passed not too long ago [Music] i don't know about tomorrow i just live from day to day [Music] i don't bore [Music] i don't worry [Music] for i know what jesus said and today i [Music] many things about tomorrow [Music] i don't seem to understand but i know [Music] i don't know [Music] [Music] but the one who fits the spirit [Music] [Music] that be my portion [Music] and i'm many things about tomorrow i don't seem to [Music] and i know who has my hands [Music] [Music] and i know [Music] to understand what i know [Music] amen thank you sister amen you know he holds your hand i know my daughter sarah had a song did the roberts have a song i i don't understand that signal i do hey hey venice brother bobby i'm going to have you finish tonight okay i've got you in mind so sarah sarah makes ready yesterday we were here in the in in with the singing and um i got here a little early and i apologize if you were offended and how i was dressed when i stood up because i didn't have any plan for that so i was casually dressed and met brother jack duff outside and we got to talking a little bit sharing so he asked about the church and this and we shared he goes oh brother aaron you got to get up you got to open the service and you got to share some of those things with us and i said look how i'm dressed he says oh that's all right just go up there and so i pre i enjoyed it last night i appreciate it much and you know sometimes we get so conscious about ourselves that we miss a blessing yeah anything so worship the lord love the lord with all your heart amen i wanted to share this um quote because to be honest yesterday was a very tough day um i was grateful after the singing such a blessing to be here for the singing and i came here when i really probably should have gone home and rested but i didn't want to dwell on what had happened at treatment and so i came here instead and just said lord i'm here to be encouraged to worship you and to just believe in spite of these things that i'm going through that you're my healer and this quote is one i have on a little plaque in my home to remind me when this started so many years ago it's from the second miracle and brother branham just says refuse to sign for anything the devil brings he will have to take it back say i refuse to have it i won't have it no sir he will have to take it back in the name of the lord if you believe it and confess it and say i've accept jesus christ as my healer there's no affliction or disease that can stay on you stay right with it so today my testimony is definitely in this song when i heard it i thought you know we often ask the lord to give us courage and we're not it's kind of faith sight unseen right but this song speaks more about that confession and always my testimony has been i confess jesus christ as my healer and today i just want to be public again to stand and say i'm healed doesn't matter what it looks like i'm healed and i know that he's going to bring that full manifestation so god bless you [Music] i've stood on the banks of a white raging river trust [Music] believing i never get lost [Music] it's through every trial each test and temptation there's over and [Music] over and over [Music] you ask is why i have no hesitation god does what he [Music] there's says he won't bring me through so why should i dwell on the heartache the way this will end is in great celebration deep in my heart i believe over and over again and again god is faithful over and over [Music] but jesus is over and over again over and over [Music] but jesus is with me so i'll claim the victory over and over again [Music] i'll tell you now don't go at it with her cause she'll she'll stand her ground amen great is thy faithfulness great as i feel oh god my father there is [Music] as i have forever [Music] is thy faithfulness [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] he also asked us to remember brother noel johnson in prayer he had he was doing i think he said some well i'll let him share it with you you share that about brother noah for prayer good evening god bless you and i'll be less than an hour my brother and old uh let me know he he'd had a cat scan uh about a week ago and they got the results back and there's something in his heart that they're not thrilled about so they're planning on putting a stent in doesn't know exactly when it's going to be it's not an emergency thing but he mentioned it and i want to share it with the body of christ because that's where my confidence lies is in the lord jesus that lives in each of you let's see if this is turned on because you know that i can't get up here without using one of these oh very good thank you and this is a testimony it's not a sermon and and probably some of you already know the answer to the puzzle to all of this and if you do that's okay i'm just a little slow but but i want to thank you for the opportunity this evening to share this testimony but when our family moved to tucson in late 1966 following year 1967 i was 17 years old and i heard brother branham say on a tape that the aims of the lord came to him on may the 7th 1946 and i also heard him say that was the same day that israel became a nation how can this be the u.n vote to partition palestine into an arab and jewish state was until november 29th 1947. the british didn't withdraw from palestine until may 14th may 15th of 1948 and that's when israel became a nation how was that the same day brother dan if you know the answer don't tell us even though i was only 17 this bothered me i was confused over the years i've asked a number of people do you know what this means but what what was he talking about how was this the same day and i did always i'd get one of two answers maybe i didn't ask the right people but i'd either get the answer well israel secretly became a nation in 1946 and they signed some deal with the vatican or i'd hear i just put it on a shelf brother i don't understand it but the prophet said it and i believe it well neither one of those answers was very satisfactory to me fast forward now to november of 1970 instead of being 17 now i'm 70 even though sometimes i still act like a teenager but it was still bothering me and i thought why would william brano a man i believe to be both a prophet and a messenger to the laodicean church age make this statement obviously he believed it was true and he repeated it many times did he really think modern israel came into being in 1946 in spite of the internment camp for holocaust survivors who desperately sought refuge in palestine from 1945 to 1948 and were blocked by the british from coming it's inconceivable brother branham may have lacked education but he did not lack intelligence people who disparage or mock brother branham's ministry use this 1946 claim as one of their arguments against what we call in love and embrace the message well i'm a little slow sometimes so i finally stopped asking people this question and i decided i needed to ask the lord help me find the answer to this enigma maybe you already know the answer i didn't know the answer my testimony tonight is simply this he did and i want to take a very few minutes to explain the solution the explanation brother branham frequently referred to the first time that he met the angel of the lord and at different times he variously states that it was the date was may 6 or may 7th in 1947 and and the earliest tape we have of april of 1947 he doesn't mention a date but he talks about it but he doesn't mention anything about israel being a nation it wasn't until 1953 that he tied the date of that encounter with the founding of the modern nation of israel now i've got a less than a minute audio clip that i'm going to try and play here if i can figure out how to use this machine it's from questions and answers on genesis july 29 1953 he'll read the question provide a little bit of background and then make the statement it appears that it's the first time he publicly made this claim and he's clearly excited about it i i personally suspect he had only recently made the connection himself so let's listen if i can do this right [Music] jews return to palestine is a fulfillment of the bible prophecy that's the question we heard you were going to palestine is that true yes yes sir let me tell you something one of the greatest if you want to see what time of year it is look on the calendar if you want to see what time of night it is look at the clock if you want to see what they were living in look where the jews are and look the very night the very day that the angel lord let me 1946 on may the 7th at greensville indiana that same day the treaty of peace was signed for the jews and they were a fabulous nation for the first time for 2500 years amen hallelujah brother branham was pretty excited but what's going on we know that israel did not exist as a nation in modern times until the first moment of may 1948. israel couldn't sign a treaty or enter an agreement with any nation before then any more than i could sign a contract before i was born so what is it about these states what is brother branham sharing with us that only he could share and the other piece that we can find anywhere may 15th isn't may 7th 1948 is not 1946. so i thought well maybe the dates are clues perhaps something is hidden in them and then i saw it let's look at a calendar for may 1948 when israel's independence was established on the world stage the calendar on the screen includes the corresponding jewish calendar dates if you can't see it it's because you're sitting too far back too much social distancing is going on here in the jewish calendar a day begins just after sunset it's because genesis 1 says for example and the evening and the morning were the first days so they don't start a day at midnight like we do they start it at around sunset well let's like take a closer look at that part of the calendar that i circled the declaration of establishment which created the modern nation of israel was to take effect at midnight on and i quote the eve of sabbath the 6 ir 5708 15th may 1948 end quote the declaration was publicly read as you see on the screen in tel aviv at 4 pm on may 14 1948. this was the fifth of ir it took effect a few hours later on the sixth of ir the year was 5708 on the jewish calendar 1948 on ours well what about 1946 you're still sitting too far back here's the entire month so let's zoom in on the dates of interest may 6th and 7th we see that may 6 1946 was the fifth of ir israel's declaration of establishment occurring exactly two years later on the jewish calendar and may 7 1946 was the sixth of ir the date when israel was reborn as a nation again on the jewish calendar this inconsistency of dates between our calendar for those two years and the jewish calendar may 6 and 7 verses may 14 and 50 is due to israel using a lunar based calendar they use the moon not the sun to establish months and dates for example you've undoubtedly noticed that easter occurs no earlier than march 22nd and no later than april 25th in a given year why isn't it on the same date every year or even the same month it isn't a consistent date on our solar based calendar because it depends on the jewish lunar base calendar for passover that's when jesus was crucified that's why you need our calendar date including the year not just may 7th but may 7 1946 to know the jewish calendar date so here i've put the two of them together you can see if i can get my limited number of notes together here i've put the zoomed in dates of 46 and 48 together here so you can plainly see that correlation may 6 corresponds to the 14th may 7 corresponds to the 16th the declaration and the birth of the nation brother branham was not claiming that israel somehow secretly became a nation and signed mysterious treaties in 1946 or that he was somehow ignorant that israel's independence didn't occur until 1948. anybody here born on lincoln's birthday or know anybody that ever claimed that they were born on lincoln's birthday well i've known several people but what they're saying isn't that they were born in 1809 they're saying they were born on february 12th and that's exactly what brother branham was telling us but it's jewish calendar dates which is appropriate because he's talking about israel what is more jewish than that so you can see that's exactly what happened you know the lord loves to hide things in plain sight god hidden and revealed in simplicity and didn't jesus admonish even commanded us in luke i say unto you ask and it shall be given to you seek you'll find knock it'll be open to you for everyone that asks receives he that seeks finds to him that knocks it shall be opened in my case it only took 54 years thank you god bless you [Applause] i'm glad that there are people who are interested in those things and i'll tell you why because if there wasn't people interested in saying we wouldn't have airplanes today we wouldn't have a lot of things that we have today because somebody has something in their heart to go out and look for it and i appreciate that brother lyle is that pertinent to salvation okay but do you appreciate god and brother brandon being exact that's what i appreciate brother branham and even history and even even well in in the launching of of uh the the rockets and all they can go back and look at the laws and say if we shoot it at this time at this speed to for this amount of time it'll enter here and to hit it right on it because they discovered that now because god set those laws in order so to god be all the glory and all the praise amen you know people have asked me a few times uh what was my what was my conversion how was i where did i come from and i can give praise and thanks to god that i was raised by godly parents my mom and dad sitting there towards the back became christians in their early lives and their teenage years and served the lord from then to this day and you know they were human parents like others and today we were talking with some of the folks about some of the little kids as they started growing they start running around started doing and i was sitting right about where little brother was sitting there on the very front row of church wooden bench no carpet so i was sitting on the inside corner there another young boy there and one on that in and those two boys were rolling the marble back and forth and if you roll a marble back and forth on the wood bench everybody hears it so the brother the minister he's the pastor and he's there and he goes there's some young boys playing right up here in the front row and i was watching but hey i wasn't playing and dad comes up from back there maybe or whether robert's boy sitting a little ways back there and he walks because he sees my head and he comes walking up next thing i know from right here he pulls me straight up and walks me straight back out and i got a weapon and all the way out saying dad i wasn't doing that i wasn't playing he goes yeah but you were sitting with him let not our identification just because we're sitting with them but because we are christians it's not good enough to just be there and just say hey i was there when it happened no i experienced the indwelling of the holy spirit i have met him for myself and it has kept me it has watched over me i can look back at some things in my young life and say that was god that was god that was god and you know what it encouraged me to say lord you haven't left me you're still with me he can keep from a young man you don't have to go out into the world you don't have to live in sin you can be a christian from a young man to whatever time god calls you home i'm a testimony of that have i failed yes i failed have i done wrong yes i've done wrong but he's kept me and i appreciate that i don't have uh regrets and say i wish i'd never gone that way i wish i'd never done that before but i thank the lord that he's kept us amen he is more than able more than able i believe that was everybody did i miss somebody that maybe had something that they wanted to share or should i pick on somebody that i think should have something to share i'll be nice and know so brother bobby i know you you have something to share so hi i thought you were just saying hi to dad so would you want to come up and share that i i meet young young couples with young children and we talked to him the other day i was walking out a store and there was a young man with two little boys and i i was how old are they oh he's three and four and i said oh my grandson my my granddaughter is this ager so here's a microphone here if you want okay and uh and they say they say oh he's three he's four and i thought the young lady with him was his daughter because she looked quite young herself and i said well you know i have six daughters and boy that's an attention grabber immediately really really like how did you manage that you know or how did that happen to you you know and i said but my youngest is already this age and they go my and his wife turns around and she looks 12 or 13 years old and she goes you must have been quite young when you had children i said and they say you were about 12. and i said no we waited till we're legal age i was 13. get a laugh on it but you know what it opens the door and i get to share a testimony to them how god has kept us or they'll see me with my children and they'll ask me on this side why are your girls like that and i said because they love the lord jesus and the lordly jesus loves them and it'll bring the question so thank you i'm not singing i'm just hiding behind piano um i wasn't going to say anything but i have a testimony and it's very important to testify so uh forgive me if i'm scattered i a few weeks ago when brother tim cross was here i went up i wasn't planning to be prayed for anything but something had been bothering me for maybe six months i don't even know how it lasted that long it was just this little voice in my head and it's one of those things that you don't realize how bad it is until you're out of it and looking back it was six months battling daily of this voice telling me that i was a vessel of dishonor and and you know and satan tries to put those thoughts in your head right and as christians we know cast it out cast it out and somehow i'd let this become so embedded and rooted in me that that night when um like we called for prayer i was like you know what tonight's the night like i'm done with this and i went up and i got prayed for and brother reggie and brother tim prayed for me and i i told him in this it's just all spilling out like i'm like i realize every day every almost every moment every day just these voices saying you're judas you're pretending you're you know there's vessels of honor and dishonor and you've been made a vessel and dishonored and someday you'll he'll fail and you're just gonna you know it's gonna manifest who you are and i'm like i have received the holy ghost i received it at the altar right there you know sometimes i'll i'll go back to that spot just to remind myself this is where this is my pathel this is my rock this is that the spot is special to me and uh so i'm like i know i'm you know but it got to the point it sounds so ridiculous but i was like lord if you chose to make me a vessel as honor i'll be the i'll be what you want me to be like how can i be that but that i went up to get prayed for and they prayed for me and i woke up the next morning and my head was clear and i didn't realize how much all that wait six months or maybe roughly just this pressure that i didn't even realize they're just over like you're not you're not it you're just playing you're just and that night i was delivered i woke up the next day nothing like my head was clear and like thank you lord and like just how small it started just these thoughts over and over and then i was delivered that night and i realized and it's so ridiculous you're just like and then brother ready told me you know that the devil's only telling you that because you're a child of god and i know that but just how much he had just gotten into my head but from that moment on not even it i call it out i know what it is and it's not bothering me is it so i just wanted to thank the lord for that [Applause] reminds me when i asked the lord after that song got stuck in my head and i just couldn't get it out i said lord what can you how can you help me and that song that says now i forgot him think about his love think about his goodness just begin to sing just begin to sing and you know what those other sounds were gone that's all and it works any time something comes at me i said no think about his love and i just began to sing it and sing that think about his love [Music] think about his friends [Music] foreign [Music] think that's brought us home for as high as the heavens [Music] sister martha the other day that we prayed for you here the church you were on the piano and i asked you to come up and i shared with you that at that time i just turned to ask you to start playing a song but someone said now let's pray for her there was a sister who had been sick for a few few weeks and she had come up not knowing why we were praying for you but in praying for you she received your healing right there too sister martha we love you and your family and we still pray for them we pray for you so be encouraged that you have children of god and they live you and your family [Music] well the first testimony service that i was in was in tucson tabernacle about 50 some years ago it was wednesday evening i believe it was december my brother green was young pastor and brother green was here that night i mean brother branham was there that night and brother green says i'd like a testimony and brother branham shot up like that he was about to come right in the middle there and he shot him he said i want to be the first i always want to be the first to give a testimony about the lord and he shocked brother greene and brother green jumped back when brother green did when brother branham did that uh i don't want to be anybody but i was around brother branham quite a bit when i was younger he lived a block and a half from our house where we lived on tyndall down where he lived in park and i don't want to be anybody i'm just going to tell you my testimony where i come from and uh i was in brother brown blast meeting in tucson tabernacle union and i was probably the last one to see him before he left that first trip i took a bag of lemons over to him because kids all like lemons if you know the apartments probably don't you probably don't know the apartments but there's there's two sides one side was the where the family lived and brother branham and sister brown lived on the other side the bedroom was there and that's where his office was and it was christmas and we got bibles that year brother brahms sidelined 524 st john st john and he signed their bible to other kids but he told me i had polio when i was younger 13 months so i've been hurting all my life it's not a big deal don't don't ever hold that if you guessed me because this brother brandon told me we were going fishing one time with him with my uncle gene norman on the patagonia and my brother said ask him so we were riding it was 6th avenue and speedway and he said bobby there's a reason you had polio to slow you down because otherwise you would slow down you would not slow down and he's right because when my leg hurts i got to slow down but he was and he said you have a calling in your life down the road and i'm not a minister i'm not a preacher i can't even i can't sing i can't do nothing so i don't know but the lord's been very good to me and my family uh the other thing my i've got a lot of history with different things through the life with brother branham i was riding my bike on a saturday morning with brother joseph him and i were good we're good still good friends to this day and uh he if you see that picture where brandon brother random has the heads where he went coming back from hunting he was out in front there just got him in and he said come here boys i want to show you something my uncle gene brought over the the magazine and showed the hofmann head of christ or the the picture on the mirror and he said i'll show you and he turned it like that and showed us how it was now that that's a memory to me i can still remember as a saturday morning that brother branham showed us that now if you don't think that if you don't think that you i'm 13 years old and i still i still think like it was a beautiful day it was he called us over he said boys i want to show you something that still touches me to this day but uh you know but he was a humble man brother branham was very humble he was very good to my family and he called my dad little little donny my dad was six three six four hands double the size of mine and uh calling the quickening power that was my dad and us our family but i got a quote i want to read you that i sent out to the brothers the other day that a brother sent me and this is how i look i look at everything happen for a reason i'm just going to tell you that's the way i believe because brother brown said that's the reason i had polio there's a reason for it and i believe that and somebody says how can you believe that when i lost my son i said there's a reason he said how in the world can you say that how can you say that and i said everything i don't care what it is it don't matter there's a reason for everything and this is i got a quote the other day on this i said brother aaron and a man take a butt and this is what it says and the main thing above everything is to keep the church in harmony and in love of god and moving on if we can be if we all can believe that the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sin and unrighteousness if the woman sitting next to you or the man sitting next to you if he doesn't believe that jesus will come actually come visible again let's just agree and go right ahead anyhow we don't agree with him on the scripture but let's make the church move on for harmony because in there there's going to be a catch some more people but when the church is out of harmony out of harmony not in agreement then you hurt the church and you can hurt the cause you it's just or just you can't do it but when we can't agree upon one thing with that the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sins and that's what i call about harmony i'm just telling you i don't care where you go to church or how you do this but just go to church and if you can't shake the brother's hand we're in trouble or sister i'm just telling you we're in trouble i'm just telling you right from my heart and that's the way i believe i might have some enemies but i don't care i love them anyway and but i just wanted to let you know a little few things like that and uh i thank god for all he's done for me and with harmony and everything has brought up we've got some good friends out of it wouldn't you see brother aaron i mean like a big family i mean it's just been great it's been i go back and i just brother aaron is telling me a testimony with the one little girl that lived with this house you can tell that when i get out of here but i mean it's just little things like that and everything matches and it's god works in mysterious ways i'm just going to tell you it's just amazing it's not amazing god is just unbelievable uh he is good and enjoy this weekend and come come and be with us but the girls the kids are going to sing did you know that they are they're going to sing them kids are singing right
