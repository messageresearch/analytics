[13:19] Is that your faith this morning? Not
[13:21] looking for something to be or just
[13:24] resting on something that was, but it's
[13:27] done. It's a finished work.
[13:30] Jesus took care of all of it. We just
[13:33] have to reach in, accept it, grab a
[13:36] hold, and hang on. It's It's a wonderful
[13:39] ride. bumpy sometimes, but just hang on.
[13:44] Have a number of uh of requests this
[13:46] morning, a number of things brought to
[13:48] our attention. Um, a lot of times we end
[13:52] with the praise. I want to start with a
[13:53] praise. and and our our sister Lorie
[13:56] Snow, who we've been praying for, that
[13:58] had that
[13:59] amazing rescue from near death when she
[14:02] had that incident on the highway up near
[14:05] Everett, Washington, is going through a
[14:07] long process of rehab, but she's home
[14:11] now. She's no longer in Washington.
[14:13] She's no longer there. She's home in
[14:16] Tucson. Still a long road to go, but
[14:19] praise God, our sister's home and she's
[14:22] on that road to recovery.
[14:27] And also in in in happy news, our
[14:30] brother John Loker is back and we're so
[14:32] glad to have him back now. And our
[14:36] our brother Jordan Peterson, who's been
[14:38] gone for a little while, is looking
[14:39] forward to coming home soon. Um our
[14:43] sister Amelia has a prayer request. It's
[14:45] it's a little unusual, but the the the
[14:47] place where she lives at the Tucson
[14:49] House and she works there that they've
[14:51] been having some issues regarding
[14:53] certain cleaning products and people
[14:55] with allergies and and and
[14:58] conflict about over that. And so she
[15:00] asked for our prayers that this would be
[15:03] resolved in a way that uh is pleasing to
[15:05] the Lord and and solves the problems
[15:08] that are that are coming up.
[15:11] Uh we also had a a note uh this morning
[15:16] that to pray for the people in Kerr
[15:18] County, Texas. You I'm sure you've all
[15:20] heard about the flash flood that in a
[15:22] matter of 40 minutes the rivers came
[15:24] together, 26 ft of water came crashing
[15:26] through. Uh and it was at 4:00 in the
[15:30] morning on July 4th. There's a girls
[15:32] Christian camp called Missing Camp and
[15:34] there's still 11 to 20 missing young
[15:36] ladies from that. We may not know these
[15:39] people, but these are Christian young
[15:40] ladies. They're part of us. We are part
[15:44] of them. We should be feeling their
[15:46] infirmity as as they as as they stand
[15:49] with us. And we need to stand with them.
[15:50] And and that also reminded me of we're
[15:54] constantly told to pray for the peace of
[15:56] Jerusalem. And we know the issues that
[15:58] are going on there, the battles, the
[16:00] conflict. I think of Ukraine. I think of
[16:03] Iran and we think of mostly the
[16:05] Ayatollah and all of that stuff. But we
[16:07] have brothers and sisters that are under
[16:09] intense persecution in that nation. We
[16:12] have brothers and sisters in intense
[16:14] persecution in many parts of the world.
[16:17] We are so blessed that we can come here
[16:19] of our own free will. No one keeps us
[16:22] out. No one forces us in. I probably say
[16:25] that a lot. But but but it's true that
[16:29] we're here by choice. We're here because
[16:31] we have that burden on our heart to be
[16:33] with one another, to draw closer to the
[16:35] Lord. And um uh something that was
[16:39] brought to my attention this morning
[16:41] that that that I'd like to read. It's
[16:44] from the sermon bomb in Gilead. And I
[16:47] think it talks about this very thing.
[16:49] Brother Brandham says, "Well, I'm not a
[16:50] seer. I'm not a prophet. I'm just a poor
[16:52] gentile. The Lord lets me be used to
[16:54] help the Gentile people in these days."
[16:56] You see, I believe it's regarded
[16:58] somewhere in the Bible as some sort of a
[16:59] gift. But whatever it is that it's a
[17:01] small and that ain't the significance of
[17:03] it. It's what we can do to help somebody
[17:06] to get closer to God. And that's for
[17:09] each and every one of us. That's not for
[17:11] this person or that person. That's for
[17:13] the person you see when you look in the
[17:15] mirror. So let's let's go to the Lord
[17:17] together this morning and just join our
[17:20] hearts together for these requests and
[17:22] then rejoicing for these praises. I'm so
[17:26] I was so happy to hear this morning that
[17:28] our sister Lori was in town. It just I'm
[17:31] just happy. Lord Jesus, Lord, we're so
[17:34] happy that that we serve you, Lord, that
[17:36] you've called us by your name, that
[17:38] you've chosen us to be your people, but
[17:40] not exclusively us to be your people.
[17:43] But there are so many brothers and
[17:45] sisters in so many places that we simply
[17:47] don't know. But Lord, there are brothers
[17:50] and sisters. We're all part of the same
[17:52] aggregate body of Jesus Christ. And
[17:55] Lord, we pray for those needs, Lord, as
[17:57] well as the needs that have been
[17:58] expressed this morning. And and those
[18:00] people that are suffering there, Lord,
[18:01] in the in the hill country of uh
[18:04] southwest Texas, Lord, that they should
[18:06] be with them that you'd comfort their
[18:08] hearts, Lord. And as as people are
[18:09] found, if as as bodies may be found,
[18:12] Lord, these young ladies, Lord, that
[18:14] we're just there to to draw aside and to
[18:16] draw closer to you, Lord. And we pray
[18:18] that you'd be with those families that
[18:20] are suffering, Lord. The the
[18:22] uncertainty. I I recall the uncertainty
[18:24] in in our family when my dad would tell
[18:26] me the story about his youngest brother
[18:28] being missing an action in World War II
[18:30] and they never found him and eventually
[18:32] they just had to declare him dead some
[18:34] 20 years later. But just those
[18:36] uncertainties, Lord, we pray that you'd
[18:39] be with those people at this time. We're
[18:41] so grateful that we can call upon your
[18:43] name and know that you're here in our
[18:45] midst, that you hear our prayers, Lord
[18:47] Jesus. Lord, we pray for the offering
[18:50] that's to be taken this morning, Lord,
[18:51] that it be used for the purposes that
[18:53] you intend. Lord, we thank you for this
[18:55] privilege we have to be together. Anoint
[18:58] our pastor this morning as he speaks
[18:59] what's on his heart. We thank you in
[19:01] Jesus name. Amen.
[19:04] God bless you.

[29:28] Oh Lord,
[29:31] haste the day
[29:34] when my faith
[29:38] shall be sight.
[29:42] The clouds
[29:44] be rolled back
[29:48] as a storm.
[29:55] The trump
[29:58] shall
[29:59] resound its coming and the Lord
[30:04] shall descend.
[30:08] even so
[30:11] it is well
[30:14] with
[30:16] my soul.
[30:18] In verse five, but Lord,
[30:22] but Lord
[30:25] is for thee,
[30:28] for thy coming
[30:33] we wait.
[30:36] The sky,
[30:38] not not the grave
[30:42] is our gold. The shout of the angel.
[30:48] Oh yes, the shout
[30:52] of the angel.
[30:55] [Music]
[30:56] Oh the voice
[30:58] of the Lord.
[31:02] Blessed
[31:03] hope and blessed
[31:07] rest
[31:08] of
[31:10] my soul.
[31:12] Sing it this morning.
[31:15] It is well
[31:22] with my soul.
[31:28] It is well.
[31:32] It is well
[31:35] with
[31:37] my soul.
[31:41] Amen.
[31:49] Amen. What a good spirit.
[31:52] Let me tell you something. I believe
[31:55] that joy that you have in your heart
[31:56] right now, I believe that you're going
[31:57] to leave today with even more joy than
[32:00] you have right now. Amen. Let's turn in
[32:02] our Bibles to as we're standing Psalm
[32:06] Psalm 139 verse 23.
[32:09] [Music]
[32:22] 139th Psalm.
[32:25] [Music]
[32:26] We'll go to verse 23.
[32:31] It says this,
[32:34] "Search me, oh God, and know my heart.
[32:38] Try me and know my thoughts
[32:42] and see if there be any wicked way in me
[32:45] and lead me in the way everlasting."
[32:50] Amen. Let's bow our heads. Our father,
[32:52] [Music]
[32:54] Lord, very powerful words from the
[32:57] psalmist.
[32:59] Father, we pray that as you search our
[33:02] hearts, Lord, that there would be no
[33:04] unclean thing found. And Lord, that you
[33:07] would bless this service today,
[33:10] meet the needs of each one that is here.
[33:13] And father, help me Lord to to stay in
[33:16] line, the line of the scriptures, the
[33:19] line of the Holy Spirit. Father, bless
[33:22] this morning's service. We ask in Jesus
[33:25] name. Amen. Amen. You can be seated.
[33:31] I chose that psalm
[33:34] to read this morning because
[33:37] I don't know if it was I asked the
[33:39] brothers. I asked Josiah said, "Did you
[33:41] read a psalm on Wednesday night? Did you
[33:43] read this psalm?" He said, "No." I asked
[33:45] brother Lyall, "Did you read Psalm 139?"
[33:48] He said, "No." And I was just going back
[33:50] and somehow
[33:53] and maybe it was just a thought that
[33:55] came to my mind, but this psalm was
[33:59] really on my heart and it's been on my
[34:02] heart all week
[34:04] and it's search me, oh God,
[34:09] and know my heart.
[34:13] And it struck me, do I really want him
[34:17] to search me?
[34:19] Do I really want him to go down into the
[34:23] deep depths of Daniel Evans and know
[34:28] everything about me? Do I really want
[34:31] that?
[34:33] And I, as I was just thinking on this
[34:37] scripture all week, I said, 'Lord, you
[34:41] know, you're a discerner all the way to
[34:45] my my very thoughts and all the way to
[34:47] the the marrow of the bone, but Lord,
[34:51] there's a lot in me that's not right.
[34:55] And Lord, help me. And I was sharing
[34:57] this with with the musicians. as I was
[35:00] sharing this psalm
[35:02] just a few minutes ago before they came
[35:04] out and you know Sister Hope's she's
[35:07] coming in she know she's in in the
[35:09] corner there and uh I I I shared this
[35:13] and I said how many of us really want
[35:17] the Lord to search our innermost lives
[35:19] and Sister Hope says um but but he
[35:22] searches us through the blood
[35:26] and I thought amen that's Right? He
[35:29] looks down on us and all of our fa
[35:31] faults and everything that we do we do.
[35:34] He sees through the blood of his son
[35:36] Jesus Christ. So I am I am grateful for
[35:39] that. But it is it's something that we
[35:42] should think about this psalm. We should
[35:43] think about Lord when you really search
[35:46] me others can search me too.
[35:49] And I want I really want love to come
[35:53] out. I really want the right things to
[35:56] come out. There's um I got a this comes
[36:00] from a few phone calls that I've got
[36:02] this past week and they're mainly from
[36:05] people that aren't part of this church
[36:08] and
[36:10] it's uh I I ministered on last Sunday
[36:13] night
[36:15] to be careful what you pray for, be
[36:18] careful of your desires.
[36:21] And some of the field the phone calls
[36:23] that I've fielded have been about uh
[36:27] another church and the the pastor there
[36:31] has always ministered about a squeeze is
[36:34] coming and the government is going to
[36:37] come in and and put this pressure on on
[36:41] people and you're going to have to make
[36:42] a choice and and and this is going to be
[36:45] a really really hard time.
[36:48] And then I see that the the squeeze has
[36:52] come down upon um this man
[36:57] and
[36:59] it's maybe not what he thought. It came
[37:02] down because of his own mistakes and his
[37:03] own sins.
[37:05] And then you have other people with the
[37:09] same situation. You have some reporters
[37:12] out and they're they're trying to dig up
[37:14] dirt and they're they're looking
[37:16] everywhere that they can. And it was
[37:17] their goal. They wanted to find
[37:20] something. They wanted to get an
[37:22] indictment. They wanted a pound of
[37:24] flesh. And you know what? They got what
[37:26] they wanted. And then you have these
[37:28] other people that have a a really bad
[37:30] attitude that maybe have left
[37:33] and uh and they are maybe out on social
[37:36] media and they're attacking and and they
[37:38] want embarrassment and they want those
[37:40] things and they get what they got what
[37:42] they want. It's it's amazing that we
[37:45] seem to always get what we want. Even
[37:49] it's when we get it, maybe it's not what
[37:52] we want. And I look at this whole
[37:55] situation
[37:57] and I think, wow, where is God in all of
[38:00] this?
[38:02] There's there's victims that that um
[38:05] should never have been exposed to what
[38:07] what they're exposed to, and there's
[38:09] there's other problems. And and I think
[38:11] that Lord, where are you in all of this?
[38:13] You have attacking and and you have all
[38:15] of these these different problems that
[38:18] are coming in and everybody seems to
[38:20] have received what they've wanted. And
[38:24] really, I don't think anyone's happy
[38:25] about anything because really God wasn't
[38:28] involved in any of it.
[38:31] You can come out of something that's
[38:34] wrong. Maybe you're in bondage in a
[38:37] dominating church or maybe you were part
[38:39] of a church with a a false prophet or
[38:41] maybe a false apostle or or you even
[38:45] maybe in a bad situation at work or in a
[38:48] relationship or whatever it might be and
[38:50] you are you receive liberty from that
[38:53] spirit. You come from that spirit. Now
[38:54] the question is how are you going to
[38:56] handle your liberty that you have now?
[39:00] That's the key question. And I see
[39:01] people all the time, they make a
[39:03] decision to leave even an oppressive
[39:05] church or relationship or job or
[39:06] whatever it might be or an organization
[39:09] and they jump on social media and they
[39:11] start attacking that organization.
[39:15] And what they're doing is they say,
[39:17] "Okay, I'm out now. I'm going to I'm
[39:20] just going to go scorched earth and I'm
[39:23] going to burn that bridge because I'm
[39:25] never going back there." But you have to
[39:27] be careful, friends, when you burn a
[39:29] bridge.
[39:31] you burn it down. You may never want to
[39:34] go back there and you shouldn't go back
[39:35] there. Of course, you've learned you
[39:37] should you shouldn't go back, but don't
[39:40] forget that bridge is now destroyed and
[39:43] someone can't come across the same
[39:46] bridge that you came across. Always
[39:49] leave those open.
[39:51] Always
[39:54] always have the right attitude and the
[39:56] right approach to things. You know, if
[39:58] you've been hurt
[40:01] and the way that you handle every
[40:04] situation, always think, how does a
[40:06] Christian handle these these things?
[40:08] What does Jesus say? Galatians 5:15 or
[40:13] verse 13 says this. For you, brethren,
[40:16] I'll read the the New King James
[40:18] Version. For you, brethren, have been
[40:19] called to liberty.
[40:22] only do not use your liberty as an
[40:24] opportunity for the flesh, but through
[40:27] love serve one another.
[40:30] For all the law is fulfilled in one
[40:32] word, even this, that you shall love
[40:34] your neighbor as yourself.
[40:37] But if you bite and devour one another,
[40:40] beware, lest you be consumed by one
[40:43] another.
[40:45] Forgiveness doesn't mean accepting sin.
[40:49] Forgiveness is when someone has done
[40:52] something that you feel is wrong to you
[40:55] and now you wipe the slate clean saying
[40:59] you don't owe me anything. That's
[41:01] forgiveness.
[41:03] The definition of forgiveness when I say
[41:06] you don't owe me anything that means no
[41:08] apology. That means nothing. You are
[41:12] forgiven.
[41:13] The definition of forgiveness says this.
[41:15] To cease to feel resentment against an
[41:19] offender. to give up resentment
[41:24] uh to give up resentment of or claim to
[41:27] reququid
[41:28] to grant relief from payment forgive a
[41:32] debt.
[41:33] That's forgiveness.
[41:36] As I said, much much of this comes from
[41:38] phone calls that I've received this
[41:40] week.
[41:41] And uh some had uh some bad attitudes
[41:44] and and and I'm not just talking about
[41:46] Tucson. I'm talking about there's
[41:47] there's a lot of like turmoil going on
[41:51] and it's it's just just the seems like
[41:54] people are just stirred up and I I mean
[41:57] I've talked to people from all over the
[41:59] the country that have seems like the
[42:02] same problem just with different
[42:04] environments, different situations and
[42:07] some had a bad attitude um and they were
[42:09] taken to social media really to tear
[42:11] down the the place that they left and
[42:14] burn those bridges. is. But one call
[42:17] that I received this week, it it really
[42:19] stood out.
[42:21] And this man said,
[42:24] he said, "I'm not against anyone."
[42:27] He said, "I benefited." And he came out
[42:29] of a tough situation. He said, "I
[42:31] benefited from my old church." And he
[42:33] said, "They taught me at that church to
[42:35] provide for my family. Taught me to work
[42:38] hard. They taught me to put God first in
[42:40] my life. But there were problems that I
[42:42] just couldn't get past is what he told
[42:44] me.
[42:46] He said uh the last
[42:50] time he was in church, he he' just been
[42:52] really struggling and and he said that
[42:54] at this church, he said that the pastor
[42:57] uh rebuked the people, rebuked the
[42:59] congregation. And he told them that they
[43:02] didn't know how to pray.
[43:04] And he said that the pastor was putting
[43:07] together a list, a series of prayers
[43:11] that he wanted them to memorize and to
[43:14] recite.
[43:16] And friends, it's it's easy to fall onto
[43:18] this stuff. It really is. But he said he
[43:23] said no. He says he tells his he told
[43:26] his wife, he says, "This is Catholic."
[43:29] He says, "We can't do this." So he tells
[43:32] his wife, he knows what was going to
[43:34] happen. He said, ' Say goodbye to your
[43:35] friends because this is the last time
[43:36] we're going to be at this church. We're
[43:38] leaving.
[43:40] And it it wasn't long ago. And then he
[43:42] went and he joined a solid church where
[43:44] they teach Christ in the Bible as a
[43:46] focused. And he's even in involved in
[43:49] the ministry now. And I look at his
[43:53] really his attitude. And it was it was
[43:57] really it was good. He had the right
[43:59] attitude. And I as he was talking I I
[44:02] was just kind of saying,"Lord, this
[44:04] brother can do something. He can make a
[44:06] difference." And I say this often as as
[44:10] he was questioning what what was being
[44:12] presented, I say this often is to
[44:16] question, and this is something that you
[44:18] don't hear very often,
[44:20] but question the way you believe.
[44:23] Does it line up with the Bible?
[44:26] And if you do find yourself in error,
[44:29] friends, don't spend your efforts trying
[44:32] to destroy someone else. God says,
[44:35] "Vengeance is mine.
[44:37] Leave that to me." Spend your efforts
[44:40] really finding the truth and then stay
[44:42] with the truth. But always don't be
[44:45] afraid to say, "Lord, am I believing
[44:48] right?
[44:50] Is this right?" Because there's
[44:51] something that just doesn't feel right.
[44:53] Like like it it sounds good. It's like,
[44:55] well, here's here's these these prayers
[44:57] that may have been perfect when they
[44:58] were said, but no, reciting prayers is
[45:00] not biblical. That's that's not in the
[45:03] scriptures.
[45:05] And he told me that he doesn't want to
[45:07] be against anyone, but he wants to help
[45:09] everyone that he can.
[45:12] And if they want to leave, he wants to
[45:13] help them. And and if they want to stay,
[45:15] he's not judging them.
[45:18] And it just it blessed me. I saw a
[45:21] really right spirit. I I felt the right
[45:23] spirit. He was on the phone as he talked
[45:25] to me and
[45:29] I I really I liked what he said. He said
[45:33] I wrote it down. He said, "I don't want
[45:35] to say anything negative against
[45:37] anyone."
[45:39] And I told him, I said, "Yeah, I've been
[45:41] there." And I've taken I took the same
[45:44] approach that you did. And I encouraged
[45:46] him. And I told him that it works
[45:49] better, that having that right approach
[45:50] and that loving approach works better
[45:52] than all the mud that you can sling from
[45:55] the pullpit or from Tik Tok or from
[45:57] YouTube or Facebook or whatever it is.
[46:01] Love and speaking good is going to be a
[46:05] lot more powerful for us than anything
[46:07] else.
[46:09] And I believe that uh the brother I
[46:11] believe he's he's really got he's going
[46:13] on a missionary trip and and he's he's
[46:15] just doing well. I believe that he's got
[46:18] something special. And and I told him, I
[46:20] said, "Brother, I'll support you as long
[46:22] as long as you stay positive and as long
[46:25] as you're not speaking negative against
[46:26] anyone like you said." And I believe
[46:28] that he will do he'll do more than any
[46:31] of the negative attacks that you see on
[46:33] any type of social media or any type of
[46:35] media. I had a friend that came along in
[46:41] u when I when I had a hard time, Daniel
[46:43] knows him. His name's Bobby White.
[46:46] Bobby was someone that came out of a a
[46:49] difficult situation in Jeffersonville.
[46:51] And it was a church that was uh had had
[46:55] issues. And I met him. He had a g he had
[47:00] a shirt that said Jesus on the front and
[47:02] it had like it looked like a like a
[47:04] softball shirt that you get when you
[47:06] play like men's league softball,
[47:07] whatever it is. And it said Jesus on
[47:09] there with a little swoosh on underneath
[47:11] it. And I said, "Hey." I said, "I'm on
[47:12] that team."
[47:14] and and I'd never seen the guy before
[47:16] and he said he says yeah he says man
[47:18] that's the only team to be on and and we
[47:21] started talking we became friends
[47:24] and he encouraged me he helped me
[47:29] because he always had a very positive
[47:31] attitude on everything and he came out
[47:34] like I said of a difficult situation in
[47:36] the church that he was in and he was
[47:39] just a positive
[47:42] good person and it it really he became a
[47:46] friend to me and we're still friends. He
[47:47] texted me this morning. I was wondering
[47:49] did I share this about him and then all
[47:51] of a sudden out of the blue he text me a
[47:53] scripture this morning and and I thought
[47:55] yeah I'll I'll mention Bobby. I pray one
[47:57] day that he can come up and give a
[47:58] testimony for us. Let me read that that
[48:02] uh Galatians 5 again 5:15. It says this.
[48:05] For for you brethren have been called to
[48:08] liberty only. Do not use your liberty as
[48:10] an opportunity for the flesh, but
[48:13] through love serve one another. For all
[48:15] the law is fulfilled in one word. Even
[48:17] this, you shall love your neighbor as
[48:19] yourself. All the law. He's talking
[48:21] about all the Bible. This is all
[48:23] fulfilled in this. That you shall love
[48:25] your neighbor as yourself.
[48:27] But if you bite and devour one another,
[48:29] beware lest you be consumed by one
[48:32] another.
[48:33] really wisdom out of the Psalms
[48:37] and thinking of that or wisdom out of uh
[48:40] yeah out of the psalm or out of uh
[48:43] Galatians and then also out of the
[48:45] Psalms search me and I think that all of
[48:49] us have in our lives we have regret
[48:54] we've done things wrong there's scars
[48:57] that we have that we just wish that we
[49:01] wouldn't have done them And regret is
[49:04] real.
[49:06] And it's we've all done things to
[49:09] produce that. And maybe we harmed
[49:11] someone or promoted a church or an
[49:14] organization that maybe you see that's
[49:15] now an error or or it could be a
[49:18] relationship, propagated a harmful rumor
[49:22] maybe about someone,
[49:24] stole something, maybe just sin in
[49:26] general. And when friends, when we
[49:30] receive forgiveness
[49:32] of our sin, when we actually someone
[49:36] forgives us for something that we've
[49:37] done wrong, doesn't it it's almost you
[49:41] can't describe how good it feels. You
[49:43] just just joy floods in and then there's
[49:46] this feeling of closure that's really
[49:49] beyond value when you are forgiven.
[49:52] Maybe it's it's so special is because by
[49:57] definition, we don't deserve forgiveness
[50:01] in any shape or form, but someone gives
[50:04] us that forgiveness. And oh, it just it
[50:07] feels so good. And if you're the one
[50:09] giving forgiveness, then you are
[50:12] liberated
[50:14] by the oppression that was caused by the
[50:17] sin that came against you.
[50:19] Forgiveness is one of the most powerful
[50:22] forces that I know of. You are if you
[50:25] forgive, you're liberated from all those
[50:28] bad feelings, from all that torment. And
[50:30] if you are forgiven, you are just
[50:32] humbled. You say, "Oh, thank you so
[50:34] much." And then there's just this love
[50:36] that comes in.
[50:38] And I uh my subject today is there is
[50:42] power in forgiveness. You think the very
[50:46] foundation of Christianity is I have
[50:48] sinned. I have done awful things in my
[50:50] life, but Christ paid a debt for me and
[50:53] I am forgiven.
[50:56] I have liberty in Christ. And if I am
[50:59] truly a Christian, friends, and I count
[51:02] on that forgiveness that Christ gave to
[51:04] me, then I forgive others because I have
[51:07] that same that same spirit that Christ
[51:10] had.
[51:12] And it's just it's it's beautiful.
[51:15] Matthew chapter 7 says, "Judge not that
[51:17] you be not judged. For with what
[51:19] judgment you judge, you will be judged,
[51:23] and with what me and with the measure
[51:25] you use, it will be measured back to
[51:27] you."
[51:28] You might say, "Well, but I know what
[51:31] they've done." Do you think
[51:34] just because you know maybe a secret sin
[51:36] or just because you know what someone
[51:38] had had it out for you or something that
[51:40] they did, you don't think that God knows
[51:43] everything that you've done either or
[51:45] everything that I've done? And when you
[51:48] truly forgive someone, you have received
[51:51] that victory.
[51:53] Jesus, he forgave us. You talk about a
[51:56] victory.
[51:58] Jesus won that victory of forgiveness
[52:00] and then that joy just it just pours in
[52:03] and there's really no longer harboring
[52:06] that that torment that that hurts us on
[52:08] both sides.
[52:10] And I was I was praying about that this
[52:13] week and I wanted to talk about
[52:15] forgiveness because we have communion
[52:17] tonight.
[52:19] And I was thinking
[52:22] really what is the greatest story
[52:25] of forgiveness in the Bible?
[52:29] What do you think? What's a story that
[52:32] you all know that is just a great story
[52:35] of forgiveness?
[52:38] When who?
[52:40] When the when the woman washed Jesus's
[52:42] feet, outstanding. Yeah. She was
[52:45] forgiven and she just poured it out.
[52:47] What's What's another one?
[52:48] Woman at the well.
[52:49] The woman at the well
[52:51] when she was forgiven of her sins. But
[52:53] how about let's go to the Old Testament,
[52:55] brother Arie.
[53:00] With David and Basheba
[53:02] and Uriah and and he was forgiven.
[53:06] But how about when a mortal man or
[53:09] mortal woman,
[53:11] not God,
[53:13] can you think of a story of a mortal man
[53:15] or a mortal woman that that gave
[53:17] forgiveness that produced amazing
[53:20] results?
[53:23] Say it louder.
[53:26] Amen. Joseph.
[53:28] Good one. Joseph in the Bible,
[53:33] Joseph is a bit of a spoiled kid.
[53:36] He tattled on his brothers to his dad.
[53:38] He had So, we know the story of Joseph.
[53:41] Joseph was the second youngest, one of
[53:44] two children born to Rachel
[53:49] um who uh died in childbirth, giving
[53:53] birth to his younger brother, Benjamin.
[53:56] Joseph was his dad's favorite
[54:00] and he, as I said, he was spoiled and
[54:02] and he tattled on his brothers and got
[54:05] him in trouble and
[54:08] Jacob, his dad, made him this coat of
[54:11] many colors and really favored the boy.
[54:13] Well, it it it built animosity
[54:17] in his brothers. That's why we as
[54:19] parents, we always need to be careful.
[54:20] Don't ever favor one kid over another.
[54:23] It it doesn't work. No matter how much
[54:25] better they are than the other one,
[54:28] no matter how much sweeter my daughter
[54:31] was than my son, I can't ever favor my
[54:34] daughter.
[54:35] I'm just kidding. I mean, both of them
[54:38] were about equal in that in that place.
[54:40] But
[54:42] you you just you can't. And but Jacob
[54:45] did. He favored this boy. And it really
[54:48] built this hatred in his 10 brothers and
[54:51] Joseph's 10 older brothers. And
[54:55] one day that they they were out tending
[54:57] the sheep and they devised this plan
[55:01] saying, "Hey, we're going to kill our
[55:04] younger brother. We're going to kill
[55:06] Joseph
[55:08] and we'll take his coat of many colors
[55:10] and we'll soak it with blood and we'll
[55:11] send it back to dad." So dad thinks that
[55:13] a wild animal killed him. So, Reuben,
[55:16] the oldest, he says, "Wait, wait, wait,
[55:19] wait, wait a minute. Let's just let's
[55:22] not kill him. Let's just throw him into
[55:24] this dry well over here and just let him
[55:27] starve to death in there and let him
[55:28] die." I mean, think about this. This is
[55:31] her brother. And Reuben in his mind, he
[55:34] had it, well, I'm going to come back
[55:35] later and save him and bring him back to
[55:38] dad.
[55:40] So the the uh the the clan of boys, they
[55:44] say, "Okay, we we'll do Reubin's idea
[55:46] and we'll we'll take Joseph and we'll
[55:48] throw him in this pit."
[55:51] So Joseph comes along and he's checking
[55:53] on Jacob sends him out. He's checking on
[55:56] the sheep. And they grab him,
[56:00] take off his coat, throw him in this
[56:02] pit,
[56:04] and
[56:06] not only did they just leave him for
[56:08] dead, but right after they did that,
[56:10] they just go down and they sit down and
[56:12] they just eat lunch like like nothing
[56:13] had ever happened. Talk about a a really
[56:16] evil thing to do. Then as um as they
[56:21] were there and and thinking about
[56:24] thinking about this, a group of
[56:27] Ishelites come through. Now if you were
[56:30] here with Lyall's study on Joseph, it
[56:33] was it was absolutely outstanding. The
[56:35] Ishelites, and brother Lyall touched on
[56:37] this, the Ishelites are from Ishmael,
[56:42] who was one of Abraham's sons. It was
[56:45] his oldest son that he had with the
[56:48] concubine.
[56:50] And Abraham ends up kicking out Abraham
[56:54] and Sarah ends up kicking out Ishmamail
[56:56] and his son because there was a a bit of
[56:59] a a um conflict going on, a bit of a
[57:02] competition between Abraham's second
[57:05] son, which was Isaac, the promised son,
[57:09] and Ishmamail. So Abraham and Sarah kick
[57:12] him out. really live out to die in the
[57:15] desert. They end up surviving. And there
[57:18] was this great hatred between Ishmael,
[57:21] the sons of Ishmael, and the sons of
[57:23] Isaac.
[57:24] And this hatred had carried on. It was
[57:26] only a couple generations later that
[57:28] these Ishelites come through. And so
[57:31] Judah, one of the brothers, is like,
[57:33] "Hey, let's not kill our brother because
[57:35] he is our brother. let's sell them to
[57:38] these IshRaelites that are coming
[57:40] through and then we'll make some money
[57:42] on them and then we don't have to kill
[57:43] them. So they sell them to these
[57:46] IshRaelites.
[57:48] They sell him into slavery. They take
[57:50] him,
[57:52] they take Jo Joseph's coat, which was
[57:56] basically a death sentence anyways, but
[57:58] they just didn't have to do it. They
[57:59] take Joseph's coat, they soak it in in
[58:02] goat's blood, they bring it back to
[58:04] Jacob and says to say, "We found this."
[58:07] And Jacob is just devastated. His son
[58:10] had been killed by a wild animal, he
[58:12] thought. So
[58:15] this story
[58:18] is is now this sticks in J in Jacob's
[58:22] mind. And Jacob makes this statement. He
[58:24] says, "I will go to my grave mourning
[58:27] for my son,
[58:29] Joseph."
[58:31] So, Joseph is is sold into slavery.
[58:35] He ends up
[58:40] he's a slave and slaves are treated like
[58:42] slaves where he ends up going to prison.
[58:44] He ends up, of course, being beaten and
[58:46] everything that it comes in with being a
[58:47] prisoner or a slave. And all of this
[58:50] time he ends up spending about 20 years
[58:52] away. And the the family is like, well,
[58:55] there's no way he could have survived.
[58:57] Of course, he's going to die because
[58:58] they're Ishelites. So, they go along
[59:00] living their lives. And Joseph is now
[59:03] just doing everything that he can to
[59:04] survive. He he's he's successful in
[59:07] whatever he does. He goes to work for
[59:09] this man. He's falsely accused by this
[59:12] this leader's wife of trying to um
[59:14] attack her. And then he gets thrown in
[59:17] prison again. and he stays in prison for
[59:19] a while and then his gift comes out and
[59:21] he's able to interpret a couple dreams
[59:24] and Pharaoh has this dream. Pharaoh is
[59:26] the king of all of Egypt of all of the
[59:29] country. He has this series of dreams
[59:31] and Joseph is able to get out of prison
[59:34] and interpret these dreams. The dreams
[59:37] are there will be seven years um of fam
[59:41] of seven years of plenty and then seven
[59:43] years of famine. And Joseph tells
[59:45] Pharaoh, "Here's the interpretation of
[59:47] your dream. We need to store up the food
[59:49] in these seven years of plenty because
[59:52] there's coming seven years of famine."
[59:54] So it happens exactly like Joseph said.
[59:56] A couple into So seven years of plenty,
[59:59] he stores up the food. Then a couple
[1:00:00] years into the famine,
[1:00:04] Joseph is selling grain to those that
[1:00:06] would come in because he's got these big
[1:00:07] graneries full. And
[1:00:11] um
[1:00:12] he's remember this is about he's about
[1:00:16] 39 years old now. Joseph is he was 17
[1:00:21] when they threw him in the pit and he
[1:00:23] has all of this time
[1:00:26] for this to stir inside of him about his
[1:00:30] brothers and what they did to him.
[1:00:33] 20 years or so pass
[1:00:38] and all of a sudden the two the brothers
[1:00:44] they come back together again. The one
[1:00:47] set of brothers thinks he's dead because
[1:00:49] of their betrayal for him. Joseph
[1:00:54] recognizes his brother. Let's let's go
[1:00:55] to the scriptures. Let's go to Genesis
[1:00:57] 42 and we'll start with verse one. I'm
[1:01:00] laying this foundation because I want
[1:01:02] you to put yourself in Joseph's place.
[1:01:06] Put yourself into the place of how
[1:01:09] someone did you so wrong. It would have
[1:01:13] been better if they would have just
[1:01:15] killed him. But instead, they slow they
[1:01:18] sold him into slavery, into torture,
[1:01:21] into the worst of the worst. And he's 20
[1:01:24] years go by and he never forgets this.
[1:01:28] Genesis 42 verse1.
[1:01:31] Now when Jacob Now there's a famine in
[1:01:33] the land. The famine's been going on for
[1:01:35] about two years. Now when Jacob saw that
[1:01:38] there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto
[1:01:40] his sons, why do ye look one upon
[1:01:43] another? And he said, "Because I have
[1:01:45] heard that there was corn in Egypt. Get
[1:01:48] you down tither and buy for us from
[1:01:50] thence, that we may live and not die."
[1:01:54] And Joseph's 10 brothers
[1:01:57] went down to buy corn in Egypt. But
[1:02:00] Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob, sent
[1:02:04] not with his brethren, for he said,
[1:02:05] "Lest per adventure, mischief befallen."
[1:02:08] So this is more than 20 years later that
[1:02:11] Jacob had lost his son. Joseph Benjamin
[1:02:14] was just a baby when Joseph was what he
[1:02:18] thought killed by the wild animal. And
[1:02:21] there was still a scar there on this old
[1:02:24] man Jacob. Now, I want to point out that
[1:02:28] it says um Joseph's 10 brethren went
[1:02:30] down to buy corn in Egypt. Corn is a
[1:02:33] King James translation word, and it's
[1:02:37] basically anything that has a kernel.
[1:02:40] So, wheat is mainly is usually what it's
[1:02:42] talking about. I I remember when I was a
[1:02:44] kid,
[1:02:46] um, dad invited this guy to church
[1:02:50] and
[1:02:52] the uh we were listening to a sermon
[1:02:56] and it was said that that they made corn
[1:03:00] cakes and he says, "Well,
[1:03:03] it couldn't have been corn because corn
[1:03:05] is native to the United States and and
[1:03:08] so so everything that you all believe is
[1:03:11] wrong." So the guy left and it was like
[1:03:15] I remember thinking like, "Wow, you're
[1:03:18] going to leave just because that the
[1:03:21] preacher said corn and not wheat?" And
[1:03:25] then I looked it up in the Bible. I was
[1:03:26] like, "No, the Bible says corn."
[1:03:29] And what had happened was he was just
[1:03:30] looking for a reason to leave. And he
[1:03:33] found it because of that. But just so
[1:03:37] you know, I mean, people there, like
[1:03:40] I've said before, a lot of people are
[1:03:42] always looking for their next former
[1:03:43] church.
[1:03:45] And that's what this guy was. And
[1:03:49] anyways, but just so you know that this
[1:03:51] means grain is what it means. And the
[1:03:54] sons of Israel, Jacob's name was changed
[1:03:57] to Israel. And the sons of Israel come
[1:04:00] to buy came to buy corn among those that
[1:04:02] came, for the famine was in the land of
[1:04:05] Canaan. And Joseph was the governor over
[1:04:07] the land. And he it was that sold to all
[1:04:10] the people of the land. And Joseph's
[1:04:12] brethren came and bowed down themselves
[1:04:15] before him with their faces to the
[1:04:18] earth. Now, Joseph had ascended to the
[1:04:21] number two person in the most powerful
[1:04:24] country in the world, Egypt. So, Joseph
[1:04:27] was a big deal.
[1:04:30] And Joseph saw his brethren. This is 20
[1:04:33] years later.
[1:04:34] And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew
[1:04:38] them,
[1:04:39] but made himself strange unto them, and
[1:04:41] spake roughly unto them? And he said
[1:04:44] unto them, "Whence come ye?" And they
[1:04:46] said, "From the land of Canaan to buy
[1:04:48] food?" And Joseph knew his brethren, but
[1:04:52] they knew not him. Joseph looked like an
[1:04:55] Egyptian. He was very, very different.
[1:04:57] He probably had a a haircut and a face
[1:05:00] more like mine, whereas clean and maybe
[1:05:04] a a beard, a fake beard, but he did not
[1:05:08] look like a Hebrew who had hair and and
[1:05:12] a full beard. He looked very, very
[1:05:15] different than what they were used to.
[1:05:17] And Joseph remembered the dreams which
[1:05:20] he had dreamed of them and said unto
[1:05:22] them, "You are spies to see the n you
[1:05:25] are spies to see the nakedness of the
[1:05:27] land you are come." So if you know the
[1:05:29] story of Joseph, Joseph had a couple
[1:05:31] dreams before that his brothers would
[1:05:34] bow down before him. Another reason his
[1:05:36] brothers hated him. They're like,
[1:05:38] "Joseph, you ain't all that, man. Why
[1:05:40] are you having all these dreams? Like
[1:05:41] you like you're the you're the big one
[1:05:43] among us. You're the special one." And
[1:05:45] Joseph was just telling the dreams to
[1:05:48] his brethren.
[1:05:49] And here we see these dreams starting to
[1:05:52] come true.
[1:05:54] And they and Joseph remember the dreams
[1:05:57] which he dreamed and said to them, "You
[1:05:58] are spies and you see the nakedness to
[1:06:01] see the nakedness of the land
[1:06:04] that you are come." And they said unto
[1:06:06] him, "No, my lord, but to buy food are
[1:06:09] thy servants come. We are all one man's
[1:06:12] son. We are true men. Thy servants are
[1:06:15] no spies. And he said unto them, "Nay,
[1:06:18] but to see the nakedness of the land,
[1:06:20] you are come." So it's customary. What
[1:06:22] Joseph is doing is it's customary that
[1:06:25] anyone from the outside would be met
[1:06:27] with suspicion.
[1:06:29] And today, national borders, it's always
[1:06:32] national borders are the same. Your
[1:06:34] passport is checked when you go across
[1:06:35] the border. They ask you where you're
[1:06:37] coming from and and what you're doing in
[1:06:39] the country. They put your stuff through
[1:06:41] the scanners in the airport. They are
[1:06:43] protecting the country. So what Joseph
[1:06:45] do is doing is really protocol. And he
[1:06:48] knows
[1:06:50] who he's talking to, but he also
[1:06:52] remembers that these men, they're his
[1:06:55] brethren, but he remembers that they are
[1:06:57] killers
[1:06:59] of what? Because of what they did to
[1:07:01] him.
[1:07:03] He doesn't know if they've repented. He
[1:07:04] doesn't know if they've changed. And
[1:07:06] they said, "Thy servants are 12
[1:07:08] brethren, the sons of one man in the
[1:07:10] land of Canaan. and behold, the youngest
[1:07:13] is this day with our father and one is
[1:07:17] not.
[1:07:19] So they're saying one of us is dead and
[1:07:21] they're saying that this is our brother.
[1:07:23] They're speaking of Joseph. So they left
[1:07:26] their youngest brother with their dad
[1:07:28] and they're speaking of their other
[1:07:31] brother Joseph who was they sold into
[1:07:33] slavery and they are assuming that he's
[1:07:36] dead.
[1:07:37] Imagine how that made Joseph feel.
[1:07:41] They're saying one is not. And there he
[1:07:44] is standing there. He's like, "No, you
[1:07:45] thought you killed me." Is probably what
[1:07:48] he's thinking in his mind.
[1:07:51] Did they ever try to find him?
[1:07:54] Did they ever go after him and say, you
[1:07:56] know, we did this wrong. Did they ever
[1:07:58] go to the Midionites and say, hey, we
[1:08:00] sold this this man. Could we find him?
[1:08:02] Is he in a prison somewhere? Is he a
[1:08:04] slave somewhere? They never even tried.
[1:08:08] At least Joseph doesn't know. And we
[1:08:09] don't there's no record of them ever
[1:08:11] even trying. And this is the man Joseph
[1:08:13] standing there and you know this is
[1:08:15] going through his mind. It's like you
[1:08:16] never even tried to find me. You forsook
[1:08:19] me and you thought I was dead. And
[1:08:22] Joseph said to them that is that is it
[1:08:26] that I spake to you saying you are
[1:08:28] spies. Hereby you shall be proved. Of
[1:08:30] course he wanted to prove them
[1:08:32] murderers.
[1:08:34] By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go
[1:08:36] forth hence except out your youngest
[1:08:39] brother come hither."
[1:08:41] Benjamin the youngest never did anything
[1:08:43] to Joseph. He was too young. He was
[1:08:45] little and at home when all of that
[1:08:47] happened.
[1:08:49] Joseph says, "Send one of you and let
[1:08:51] him fetch your brother and ye shall be
[1:08:53] kept in prison that your words may be
[1:08:55] proved whether there be any truth in you
[1:08:57] or else by the life of Pharaoh surely
[1:08:59] you are spies." And he put them all
[1:09:02] together
[1:09:03] into ward three days. And Joseph said
[1:09:06] unto them the third day, "Do this." He
[1:09:08] said, "This do, and live, for I fear
[1:09:11] God.
[1:09:13] If you be true men, let one of your
[1:09:16] brethren be bound in the house of your
[1:09:19] of your prison. Now go ye and carry corn
[1:09:22] for the famine of your houses." So he's
[1:09:24] saying, "Just keep one here."
[1:09:27] and he's worried about I can see Joseph
[1:09:29] was probably worried about the families
[1:09:31] and he wanted to send grain to keep them
[1:09:33] from starving.
[1:09:35] But bring your youngest brother unto me
[1:09:38] so shall your words be verified and you
[1:09:40] shall not die. And and they did so. So
[1:09:43] he's keeping one hostage. He says, "Now
[1:09:45] go and take take the grain."
[1:09:48] Now they're going to talk privately
[1:09:50] among themselves. They didn't know that
[1:09:52] Joseph was a Hebrew and spoke Hebrew and
[1:09:56] understood what they were saying. Now,
[1:09:58] watch the guilt that these men feel from
[1:10:02] way back when. And they said one to
[1:10:05] another, "We are verely guilty
[1:10:08] concerning our brother." They're not
[1:10:10] talking about Benjamin. They're talking
[1:10:12] about Joseph.
[1:10:14] That regret, that pain was still with
[1:10:18] these 10 10 brothers.
[1:10:20] in that we saw the ang anguish of his
[1:10:23] soul and when he besought us and we
[1:10:25] would not hear therefore is this
[1:10:27] distress coming upon us. They're saying
[1:10:29] he was in the pit and he was crying out
[1:10:31] like guys don't leave me here I'm going
[1:10:33] to die in here and there they are eating
[1:10:35] lunch
[1:10:37] and maybe laughing at him.
[1:10:40] This was in their hearts. This regret,
[1:10:43] the sin that was on these brothers, they
[1:10:45] were feeling terrible.
[1:10:50] And Reuben answered them,
[1:10:53] saying, "Spake I not unto you, saying,
[1:10:55] do not this sin against this child, and
[1:10:58] you would not hear. Therefore, behold
[1:11:00] also, his blood is required." Reuben's
[1:11:02] the one that said, "Hey, don't do it.
[1:11:05] Just leave him." And he was going to
[1:11:06] come back and rescue him. But he's
[1:11:07] saying, "Hey, I told you so." But Reuben
[1:11:10] was also guilty.
[1:11:13] This is a 20-year-old feeling in these
[1:11:16] 10 brothers. They basically murdered
[1:11:18] their little brother because they were
[1:11:20] jealous. And once he was gone, there was
[1:11:22] no way for them to make it right.
[1:11:25] There was no way to apologize. There was
[1:11:28] no way to repent.
[1:11:30] Put yourself in their shoes.
[1:11:33] Friends, if if there is if you have done
[1:11:35] something wrong, if you have hurt
[1:11:38] someone, if you have sinned against
[1:11:41] someone, don't ever wait to make it
[1:11:44] right.
[1:11:46] Make it right as soon as you can because
[1:11:48] that opportunity to apologize might be
[1:11:52] taken away.
[1:11:54] The Lord might take that person, might
[1:11:57] move them away. They might just be lost
[1:12:01] as Joseph was. Make sure that you take
[1:12:05] every opportunity that you have to make
[1:12:08] a wrong right. And here they are just
[1:12:11] lamenting that they did what they did
[1:12:13] and they had no way to make these things
[1:12:15] right.
[1:12:20] You know, they're talking about what
[1:12:21] they did and and the regret that they're
[1:12:24] feeling was because of their own
[1:12:26] actions. And our greatest regret,
[1:12:28] friends, all of us, our greatest regrets
[1:12:31] are from what we have done or what we
[1:12:34] have not done. Our greatest regrets are
[1:12:37] not from what someone has done to us. is
[1:12:39] because of what we have done.
[1:12:42] Unconfessed sin or discord or even if
[1:12:45] you think you are right, it will still
[1:12:47] weigh upon you if there is discord.
[1:12:52] Matthew chapter 5, Jesus says this verse
[1:12:55] 22, he says, "But I say to you, I'll
[1:12:57] read the New King James Version. But I
[1:12:59] say unto you that whoever is angry with
[1:13:01] his with his brother without a cause
[1:13:03] shall be in c shall be in danger of
[1:13:04] judgment. And whoever says to his
[1:13:06] brother Raqqa shall be in danger of
[1:13:09] counsel. But you whoever says you fool
[1:13:12] shall be in danger of hellfire. Just
[1:13:14] calling him a name.
[1:13:18] Therefore, if you bring your gift to the
[1:13:20] altar and there remember that your
[1:13:22] brother has something against you.
[1:13:27] Leave your gift before the altar and go
[1:13:30] your way. First be reconciled to your
[1:13:32] brother and then come and offer your
[1:13:35] gift.
[1:13:37] Agree with your adversary quickly
[1:13:40] while you were on the way with him, lest
[1:13:42] your adversary deliver you to the judge
[1:13:44] and the judge hand you over to the
[1:13:46] officer and you be thrown into prison.
[1:13:48] Assuredly I say to you, you will will by
[1:13:51] no means get out of there until you have
[1:13:53] paid the last penny. So if you don't
[1:13:56] forgive and require someone else to pay
[1:13:58] their debt to you in the form of an
[1:14:00] apology, let's say,
[1:14:03] then you will be held to that same
[1:14:04] standard is what Jesus is saying. Back
[1:14:08] to Genesis 42:23.
[1:14:12] And they knew not that Joseph understood
[1:14:15] them, for he spake unto them by an
[1:14:16] interpreter. And he turned himself about
[1:14:19] from them and wept and returned to them
[1:14:22] again and communed with them and took
[1:14:26] from them Simeon and bound him before
[1:14:30] their eyes. So now his he takes his
[1:14:32] hostage which he had promised and it was
[1:14:34] Simeon.
[1:14:35] Look at the feelings of Joseph.
[1:14:39] Remember these Bible characters are real
[1:14:42] people. They're not just fictional
[1:14:44] stories. These are real people with real
[1:14:47] flaws. They are human. These guys sold
[1:14:51] him. They sent him to be a slave. He
[1:14:53] suffered horribly because of them. Now
[1:14:55] put yourself in Joseph's position at
[1:14:58] that time in the prison cell that you
[1:15:00] were sitting in the prison cell going
[1:15:02] over these things over over and over in
[1:15:04] your mind. Now you have them at your
[1:15:06] mercy.
[1:15:08] But there was something in Joseph that
[1:15:10] was real. Joseph had great character.
[1:15:15] We've heard many times that he is a type
[1:15:17] of Christ and there are so many
[1:15:18] similarities between this Joseph and
[1:15:21] this man Jesus Christ. Forgiveness is
[1:15:23] not the least of those.
[1:15:26] Then Joseph commanded to fill their
[1:15:27] sacks with corn and to restore every
[1:15:29] man's money into his sack to give them
[1:15:31] provision for the way. And thus did he
[1:15:34] to them. So he secretly placed the money
[1:15:36] that they gave him for the grain into
[1:15:39] their bags that they paid.
[1:15:42] And they laden their asses with corn and
[1:15:44] departed thence. And as one of them
[1:15:46] opened his sack to give his ass proer,
[1:15:49] in in the end he aspied his money, for
[1:15:53] behold, it was in his sack's mouth. So
[1:15:56] he opened up his bag to give his donkey
[1:15:58] some feed, and he found the money that
[1:16:00] he was going to give that he paid for
[1:16:04] this grain.
[1:16:06] And he said unto them, "Brethren, my
[1:16:08] money is restored, and lo, it is even in
[1:16:11] my sack." And there are their heart
[1:16:13] failed them, and they were afraid,
[1:16:15] saying one to another, "What is this
[1:16:17] that God hath done to us unto us?" Now,
[1:16:20] this was a gift.
[1:16:22] They should have been happy. But look at
[1:16:25] what guilt does in our lives. It takes
[1:16:27] all our joy. It will take a a blessing
[1:16:30] and make you suspicious about that
[1:16:32] blessing. The most susp suspicious
[1:16:35] people are usually, not always, but the
[1:16:38] most suspicious people are usually often
[1:16:40] the most guilty people because they
[1:16:42] think that people act or are going to
[1:16:45] act the way that they act. They think
[1:16:48] that the way that people think are the
[1:16:51] ways that they think
[1:16:54] and they respond in the same way.
[1:16:57] And these men are acting like guilty
[1:16:59] men. Why is there money in our bag?
[1:17:01] Should have been a gift.
[1:17:04] Now, for time's sake, they bring the
[1:17:07] grain back and they tell their dad
[1:17:11] what the man wants. They get back to
[1:17:13] back to Jacob. They tell their dad what
[1:17:17] the man wants
[1:17:19] and that Benjamin needs to come and
[1:17:22] Jacob says, "No, not a chance. I'm not
[1:17:26] sending Benjamin. I lost one son and I'm
[1:17:29] not going to lose another one with you
[1:17:31] guys.
[1:17:34] So then time goes by and the famine gets
[1:17:39] worse and Jacob and his family, they run
[1:17:41] out of food. Now Judah takes the lead
[1:17:44] and he tells his dad, he says, "Dad, we
[1:17:46] got to go back to Egypt. We got to take
[1:17:49] Benjamin back to Egypt with us." before
[1:17:52] one of them, I think it was it was uh
[1:17:54] Reuben or Simeon, the one that didn't
[1:17:56] get kept, it was uh Reuben, he tells his
[1:17:59] dad, he says, "No, Dad, let us go back
[1:18:02] and if if we don't bring if if we don't
[1:18:05] bring Benjamin back with us with the
[1:18:07] grain, then dad, you can kill two of my
[1:18:09] sons." Oh, that's a great idea.
[1:18:12] Yeah, let me two kill two more of my
[1:18:14] grandchildren. You see how they're
[1:18:16] thinking?
[1:18:18] But Reuben, I mean, but but Judah,
[1:18:22] he says, "Dad," he says, "we got to go
[1:18:24] back." And he said, "The man told us, if
[1:18:26] we don't come with Benjamin, then don't
[1:18:28] come at all. So, let me take Benjamin. I
[1:18:30] personally guarantee his safety. It'll
[1:18:32] be on my head, Dad.
[1:18:34] We could go. We could have gone and come
[1:18:36] back twice by now. Let us go." Jacob
[1:18:39] gives in, says, "Take Benjamin and get
[1:18:41] the grain." So, they take Benjamin back
[1:18:43] to Egypt. They meet Joseph. And over and
[1:18:46] over,
[1:18:48] every time something goes wrong, the
[1:18:51] brothers refer back to their sin of
[1:18:54] Joseph. Every time they start to get
[1:18:56] pressure on them, they keep going back.
[1:18:58] We deserve this. We killed Joseph. God's
[1:19:00] punishing us for our sins from 20 years
[1:19:03] ago. That unconfessed sin. That sin that
[1:19:06] just that just stood on them, that
[1:19:08] unforgiven sin. Let's go to Genesis 44.
[1:19:17] Now
[1:19:18] they, as I said, Jacob gives in. They
[1:19:22] take Benjamin and all of them back. And
[1:19:25] Jacob's like, "Hey, bring some of these
[1:19:26] gifts and bring money to pay and just
[1:19:28] basically confess everything and please
[1:19:31] bring Benjamin back with the food."
[1:19:36] Joseph is there and he lifted up his
[1:19:39] eyes
[1:19:41] and saw his brother Benjamin, his
[1:19:44] mother's son. Now remember, his mother
[1:19:47] died in childbirth with Benjamin.
[1:19:51] So Benjamin also represented his mom.
[1:19:54] Everything that Joseph had in the world,
[1:19:57] every memory he has, every good memory
[1:20:00] is tied up in this Benjamin who he
[1:20:03] loved. He was just a little boy. his mom
[1:20:06] and his dad.
[1:20:09] And he lifted up his eyes and he saw his
[1:20:11] brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and
[1:20:14] he says, "Is this your younger brother
[1:20:15] of whom you spake unto me?" And they
[1:20:18] said, "God be gracious unto thee, my
[1:20:20] son." And Joseph made haste, for his
[1:20:22] bowels did yearn upon his brother. And
[1:20:25] he sought where to weep, and he entered
[1:20:27] into his chamber, and he wept there,
[1:20:30] and he washed his face, and went out.
[1:20:33] I'm sorry, I'm on verse 31. And he
[1:20:35] washed his face and he went out and he
[1:20:38] refrained himself and said, "Set on
[1:20:42] bread." And they set on for him by
[1:20:45] himself and for them by themselves and
[1:20:48] for the Egyptians which did eat with
[1:20:50] with them by themselves because the
[1:20:52] Egyptians might not eat bread with the
[1:20:54] Hebrews. For that was an abomination
[1:20:56] under the Egyptians.
[1:20:59] And they sat before him, the firstborn
[1:21:01] according to his birthright, and the
[1:21:02] youngest according to his youth.
[1:21:04] And the men marveled
[1:21:07] one at another.
[1:21:09] And he took and sent messes unto them
[1:21:12] from before him. But Benjamin's me
[1:21:14] Benjamin's plate
[1:21:16] was five times as much as theirs. And
[1:21:19] they drank and they were married with
[1:21:20] him. So they're having this banquet
[1:21:24] with this king of second king of Egypt.
[1:21:30] And then Joseph commanded verse number
[1:21:33] 44:1
[1:21:35] Joseph commanded the steward of his
[1:21:37] house saying fill the men's sack with
[1:21:39] food and as much as they can carry and
[1:21:40] put every man money every man's money in
[1:21:43] his in his sack's mouth and put my cup
[1:21:46] the silver cup in the sack sacks mouth
[1:21:50] of the youngest in his corn money. And
[1:21:53] he did according to the word that Joseph
[1:21:55] had said. And as soon as the morning was
[1:21:59] light, the men were sent away, they and
[1:22:01] their asses. And when they were gone out
[1:22:04] of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph
[1:22:07] said unto his steward, "Up and follow
[1:22:11] the men, and when thou do when thou dost
[1:22:13] take over them, overtake them, say unto
[1:22:15] them, wherefore have you rewarded evil
[1:22:17] for good? It is not this
[1:22:21] it in which my lord drinkketh and
[1:22:24] whereby indeed he divineth ye have done
[1:22:26] evil in in the sight evil in so doing so
[1:22:30] so Joseph's setting them up and he's
[1:22:32] putting this silver cup that's probably
[1:22:34] worth a lot of money in Benjamin's bag.
[1:22:38] So the steward steward catches up with
[1:22:41] them.
[1:22:43] He takes him. He's upset. He knows
[1:22:46] what's going on. He brings them all back
[1:22:51] to Egypt.
[1:22:54] Verse number 11. Then they speedily took
[1:22:56] down every man his sack to the ground
[1:22:57] and opened every man their sack and
[1:22:59] searched and began at the eldest and
[1:23:01] left the youngest. And the cup was found
[1:23:02] in Benjamin's sack. And they rent their
[1:23:05] clothes and laid it every man his ass,
[1:23:07] and returned to the city. And Judah and
[1:23:09] his brethren came to Joseph's house, for
[1:23:11] he was yet there, and they fell before
[1:23:13] him on the ground. And Joseph said unto
[1:23:15] them, "What deed is this that you have
[1:23:17] done? What ye not that such a man as I
[1:23:22] can certainly divine?"
[1:23:25] And Judah said, "What shall we say unto
[1:23:28] my Lord? What shall we speak? Or how
[1:23:30] shall we clear ourselves? God hath found
[1:23:32] out, listen to this, God hath found out
[1:23:35] the iniquity of thy servants. Behold, we
[1:23:39] are my Lord's servants, both we and he
[1:23:42] also with the cup on whom it is found.
[1:23:44] So God has found out the guilt of your
[1:23:48] servants. They didn't steal a silver
[1:23:50] cup.
[1:23:51] It was the guilt that they had committed
[1:23:54] decades earlier.
[1:23:56] Judah knows they're guilty of a lot more
[1:23:58] than just stealing that cup. So skip to
[1:24:00] ver verse 33. Judah speaking. He says, '
[1:24:04] Now therefore, I pray thee,
[1:24:07] let thy servant abide instead of of the
[1:24:10] lad, a bondman to my lord, and let the
[1:24:13] lad go up with his brethren.
[1:24:17] For how shall I go up to my father, and
[1:24:19] the lad be not with me, lest per
[1:24:21] adventure I see the evil that shall come
[1:24:23] on my father?" So Judah now is offering
[1:24:26] himself to be a slave instead of
[1:24:29] Benjamin.
[1:24:31] It's overwhelming. And and Joseph sees
[1:24:34] the love from Judah for his father. And
[1:24:37] he sees Judah make a stand for Benjamin.
[1:24:40] And I'll bet Joseph took it personally.
[1:24:43] They sold me into slavery and never came
[1:24:45] looking for me. But now they are willing
[1:24:48] to give their lives for their brothers.
[1:24:51] People change, friends. People change.
[1:24:55] God will allow us to make a mistake. And
[1:24:58] some of us have made horrible mistakes
[1:25:00] in our lives. But don't judge someone on
[1:25:03] their sins. And even don't judge someone
[1:25:06] on their sins against you. Watch Joseph
[1:25:09] here. Joseph forgive forgave them. And
[1:25:12] we should forgive each other. Now watch
[1:25:14] the power of forgiveness in Joseph.
[1:25:19] It has such an effect. And we are still
[1:25:22] feeling the power of Joseph's
[1:25:24] forgiveness even this day.
[1:25:28] Genesis 45.
[1:25:31] and we'll close and the musicians can
[1:25:33] come. Then Joseph could not refrain
[1:25:35] himself from all them that stood by him.
[1:25:37] And he cried, "Cause every man to go out
[1:25:39] from me." And there stood no man with
[1:25:41] him while Joseph made himself known to
[1:25:43] his brethren. And he wept aloud and the
[1:25:46] Egyptians in the house of Pharaoh heard.
[1:25:48] And so the brothers are standing there
[1:25:50] and they're watching. And here's this
[1:25:51] powerful man that that can kill them or
[1:25:53] do whatever. And he just breaks down
[1:25:55] crying. And Joseph said unto his
[1:25:58] brethren, I am Joseph.
[1:26:02] Doth my father yet live? And his
[1:26:05] brethren could not answer him. For they
[1:26:06] were troubled as his presence. I bet
[1:26:08] they were. That guilt they probably
[1:26:09] thought that they were going to get
[1:26:10] killed.
[1:26:13] And Joseph said unto his brethren, "Come
[1:26:15] near to me, I pray you." And they came
[1:26:18] near, and he said, "I am Joseph, your
[1:26:20] brother, who you sold into Egypt. Now
[1:26:23] therefore, be not grieved, nor angry
[1:26:25] with yourselves, that ye sold me hither,
[1:26:28] for God did send me before you to
[1:26:30] preserve life.
[1:26:32] For these two years hath the hath the
[1:26:34] famine been in the land, and yet there
[1:26:36] are five years in which there shall be
[1:26:38] neither neither earing nor harvest. So
[1:26:40] there's still five more years of this
[1:26:42] famine. And God sent me before you to
[1:26:45] preserve you
[1:26:47] in the at posterity in the earth and to
[1:26:50] save your lives by a great deliverance.
[1:26:53] So this man that you p pretty much
[1:26:55] murdered,
[1:26:56] I'm going to save you. Who does that
[1:26:59] sound like? The one that the one that
[1:27:02] you murdered, where'd you get these
[1:27:03] scars? In your hands. In the house of my
[1:27:06] friends. So now it was not you that sent
[1:27:10] me hither, but God. And he made me a
[1:27:14] father to Pharaoh and lord of all his
[1:27:16] house and a ruler throughout all the
[1:27:18] land of Egypt. So he's saying that it
[1:27:20] was not you that sent me. It was not you
[1:27:22] that did it. It was God that did it.
[1:27:25] What an attitude from Joseph. Can you
[1:27:28] imagine? He said, "This is all for the
[1:27:30] best."
[1:27:33] Many of us could say, "I'm a better man
[1:27:34] now than before someone sinned against
[1:27:37] me."
[1:27:42] God used people and he uses he used
[1:27:48] Piper and he used Pharaoh and he used
[1:27:50] these these 10 brothers of Joseph to do
[1:27:53] him harm. But Joseph came out a better
[1:27:56] man because of it.
[1:27:59] He was the second most powerful man in
[1:28:01] the world. He had the authority to give.
[1:28:03] He had the authority to take. He had the
[1:28:05] authority to kill. He could have easy
[1:28:07] easily executed his brothers and just
[1:28:09] save Benjamin and and J and Jacob. But
[1:28:12] he chose to forgive
[1:28:14] and what came from it. I'm telling you,
[1:28:17] all of us should put the our place in
[1:28:19] Joseph's ourselves in Joseph's place.
[1:28:21] Nobody's done wrong to us like they did
[1:28:23] to Joseph.
[1:28:25] Put ourselves in Joseph's place.
[1:28:28] and he forgive. Now watch the power of
[1:28:30] forgiveness. He forgave them. He saved
[1:28:33] them. He preserved their lives no matter
[1:28:35] what they had done for them. He overcame
[1:28:37] it. And now he is feeding the family.
[1:28:40] And who comes from this line of Judah?
[1:28:42] King David.
[1:28:44] Later on
[1:28:46] without Joseph's forgiveness, there
[1:28:48] would be no King David.
[1:28:51] Who came from the from the the lineage
[1:28:53] of another brother, Levi, Moses.
[1:28:57] Samuel
[1:29:00] without the kindness of David and the
[1:29:03] forgiveness I mean the kindness of
[1:29:05] Joseph and the forgiveness of Joseph
[1:29:07] there would be there would have been no
[1:29:09] Moses.
[1:29:12] What if he would have chosen not to
[1:29:14] forgive? He had every right to not not
[1:29:17] to forgive. And how many of us friends
[1:29:20] have had things done to us and yet we
[1:29:25] harbor ill feelings in our hearts
[1:29:28] and if we would just forgive. They
[1:29:31] started weeping and praising and and
[1:29:33] they were all hugging Joseph. They were
[1:29:35] afraid at first but it was just this
[1:29:37] wonderful wonderful unity them coming
[1:29:40] together all the brothers and they were
[1:29:42] happy and Joseph's like no it was God
[1:29:45] that did all of this. Imagine if
[1:29:46] somebody did us wrong and we would say,
[1:29:48] "You know what? It was God that used you
[1:29:52] because I'm a better man now." I can say
[1:29:54] that. I can say that today. I'm a better
[1:29:58] man because of some of the things that I
[1:30:01] have suffered. And I can go to those
[1:30:04] people
[1:30:05] that have caused maybe some of the
[1:30:07] suffering, not bad, but some of the
[1:30:09] suffering in my life, and I can say,
[1:30:11] "I'm a better man." No, God used you.
[1:30:13] I'm a better man because of these
[1:30:16] things. And in preparation for tonight's
[1:30:19] communion service, friends,
[1:30:21] make sure you have forgiven everyone.
[1:30:25] Everyone who's ever done anything wrong
[1:30:27] to you, make sure there is no problem in
[1:30:30] your heart with them, whether they've
[1:30:31] asked for forgiveness or not. And then
[1:30:34] you watch what God will do in your life.
[1:30:36] if you can get past it and then make
[1:30:39] sure if you have done wrong
[1:30:42] to someone, make sure you go to that
[1:30:44] person because you might not have that
[1:30:46] chance ever again.
[1:30:49] Thank God
[1:30:51] for the these 10 brothers sake, they had
[1:30:53] a chance to make things right with their
[1:30:55] brother. And Joseph's like, "It wasn't
[1:30:58] you. It was God that did it." And think
[1:31:02] about Jesus Christ.
[1:31:04] Jesus comes up.
[1:31:08] Later on, we see they come to him and
[1:31:10] they say, "Where'd you get these scars?"
[1:31:13] Basically, you did them.
[1:31:16] These scars are what you gave me. My
[1:31:18] friends gave me these scars,
[1:31:21] but it was all for God. It was for
[1:31:23] salvation. Friends, do you get my point
[1:31:26] in my sermon?
[1:31:29] Never hold any hot any against anyone no
[1:31:32] matter what they have done to you. And
[1:31:35] if you have done anything to anyone
[1:31:37] else, make sure you make it right
[1:31:39] because you might not have that
[1:31:40] opportunity in the future. Amen.
[1:31:44] Will you consider it?
[1:31:46] Let's all stand. Brother Josiah,
[1:31:53] he has
[1:31:56] forgiven
[1:31:59] me.
[1:32:01] My sins
[1:32:03] have been washed
[1:32:06] from his memory
[1:32:12] by the blood
[1:32:14] of the lamb
[1:32:18] of Calary.
[1:32:24] He
[1:32:26] has
[1:32:28] forgiven
[1:32:32] me. Sing it again. Yes, he
[1:32:37] has
[1:32:39] forgiven
[1:32:42] me.
[1:32:45] My sins have been washed
[1:32:50] from his memory
[1:32:55] by the blood
[1:32:57] of the lamb
[1:33:01] of Calary.
[1:33:07] He
[1:33:10] has
[1:33:12] forgiven
[1:33:15] me.
[1:33:23] I will bless thee, oh Lord.
[1:33:29] I will bless thee, oh Lord,
[1:33:35] with a heart of thanksgiving.
[1:33:42] I will bless thee, oh Lord.
[1:33:46] Sing that again.
[1:33:48] Oh, I will bless thee, oh Lord.
[1:33:52] Lord,
[1:33:54] I will bless thee, oh Lord,
[1:33:59] [Music]
[1:34:01] with a heart of thanksgiving,
[1:34:07] I will bless thee, oh Lord.
[1:34:13] And with my hands lifted up
[1:34:19] and my mouth filled with praise,
[1:34:25] with a heart of thanksgiving.
[1:34:29] [Music]
[1:34:31] I will bless thee, oh Lord, with my
[1:34:35] hands lifted up. Oh, with my hands
[1:34:39] lifted up.
[1:34:44] and my mouth filled with praise
[1:34:50] with a heart of thanksgiving.
[1:34:56] I will bless thee, oh Lord. I will bless
[1:34:59] thee.
[1:35:01] Oh, I will bless thee, oh Lord.
[1:35:08] I will bless thee, oh Lord,
[1:35:14] with a heart of thanksgiving.
[1:35:20] I will bless thee, oh Lord.
[1:35:24] [Music]
[1:35:25] Amen.
[1:35:28] Can you imagine the story of Joseph?
[1:35:32] And it's not just a story. This really
[1:35:34] happened.
[1:35:36] I mean, there's no stories that can
[1:35:38] compare to these stories that are in the
[1:35:40] Bible. They're just they're beautiful.
[1:35:42] Can you imagine this man and these
[1:35:44] people that did the worst that they
[1:35:47] could have done to him
[1:35:49] and him coming and them, oh, with just
[1:35:53] the repentance in their heart, h we're
[1:35:57] sorry. And he says, "No."
[1:36:00] He said, "It's okay." He said, "God did
[1:36:03] it." And God did it so that you might be
[1:36:08] saved.
[1:36:10] And look at our Lord Jesus.
[1:36:12] We might bow down before him and I do.
[1:36:15] And I say, "Lord, I'm so sorry.
[1:36:19] I'm so sorry that I've failed you. I'm
[1:36:21] so sorry that I've made mistakes through
[1:36:23] my life." And then he just looks down at
[1:36:26] me, says, "Son, it's okay. I paid the
[1:36:31] price. You are forgiven. Now you go and
[1:36:35] forgive others as I have forgiven you.
[1:36:38] You go and make things right with
[1:36:40] others. You live what I have spoken. If
[1:36:43] you love me, sons and daughters, if you
[1:36:47] love me, keep my commandments
[1:36:49] is what the Lord Jesus said.
[1:36:53] So in preparation for tonight communion
[1:36:56] service,
[1:37:00] the Bible says, "Let a man examine
[1:37:01] himself."
[1:37:03] And if there be
[1:37:05] any problems with us, friends, there be
[1:37:09] any problems with someone else,
[1:37:12] make it right now. Make it right today.
[1:37:16] Maybe somebody that has done you wrong.
[1:37:19] Don't go to him and say, "I forgive
[1:37:21] you." But go to him and say, "I'm a
[1:37:25] better person now.
[1:37:27] I'm a better person because of all
[1:37:28] this." And whether they repent or not,
[1:37:31] it's nothing on you. It matters what you
[1:37:34] do. It doesn't matter what they've done.
[1:37:36] Amen. You feel good,
[1:37:39] friends. It's a good day. It's a good
[1:37:41] day to be a Christian. Let me tell you,
[1:37:44] you make things right with people. Oh,
[1:37:47] just the joy. If you can set aside
[1:37:51] those problems that you have with people
[1:37:53] and really forgive someone, it feels so
[1:37:56] good. And boy, it feels really good when
[1:37:58] you're forgiven
[1:38:00] and you can just set it set aside and
[1:38:03] move forward. Let's bow our heads.
[1:38:07] Our heavenly father, we thank you Lord.
[1:38:10] We thank you for your forgiveness of all
[1:38:12] of us.
[1:38:14] And Lord, we want to take this spirit
[1:38:17] that is in your word. Take this spirit
[1:38:20] that we read in your Bible. And Lord, we
[1:38:23] want to manifest that spirit to others
[1:38:26] as Joseph did. Father, those that might
[1:38:29] hate us or speak evil of us. Lord, we
[1:38:31] pray for those people.
[1:38:34] Lord, have mercy on them.
[1:38:38] And Father, for those that we have done
[1:38:39] wrong.
[1:38:41] Oh dear God, let us let us get it get to
[1:38:45] them and make it right. Lord, help us.
[1:38:48] Lord, facilitate that. We pray that that
[1:38:51] we could go and make things right
[1:38:54] and just Lord feel just feel delivered
[1:38:58] from the weight of sin.
[1:39:01] Feel delivered from the weight of
[1:39:03] oppression and bondage.
[1:39:06] Lord, we thank you. We thank you for
[1:39:08] your word, Father. We thank you for this
[1:39:10] story of Joseph.
[1:39:12] Oh Lord, it it's just it just does my
[1:39:15] heart good.
[1:39:17] And now Lord, when when we sing that
[1:39:20] psalm or or Lord, when we read that
[1:39:23] psalm where it says, "Search me, oh
[1:39:25] Lord."
[1:39:26] Lord, we can come before you because
[1:39:28] we've made things right with our
[1:39:29] brethren. We can come before you and
[1:39:31] say, "Search me, oh Lord. There's sins
[1:39:33] all over. But Lord, you're looking
[1:39:35] through the blood of your son, Jesus
[1:39:37] Christ, and I've done everything that I
[1:39:39] can.
[1:39:41] Lord, let us get to that point. I pray
[1:39:43] bless each one here.
[1:39:47] Father, may every person present in this
[1:39:51] building today and those that
[1:39:53] are on through, Father, the stream, I
[1:39:56] pray for each one that all things would
[1:39:58] be well, that you would bless them,
[1:40:01] Lord, and help us, Father, help us to
[1:40:04] represent Jesus Christ in this day. In
[1:40:08] his name we pray. Amen.
[1:40:12] Amen.
