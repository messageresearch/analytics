[15:09] i think you were playing it this morning
[15:11] how deep the father's love for
[15:13] [Music]
[15:25] beyond us measure
[15:29] that he should give his only son
[15:34] to make a wretch his treasures
[15:42] [Music]
[15:44] the father turns his face away
[15:50] as wounds which are the chosen one
[15:55] bring beneath
[16:04] [Music]
[16:07] my sin upon his shoulders
[16:12] ashamed i hear my mocking voice
[16:17] [Music]
[16:22] it was my sin that held in there

[16:32] his dying breath has brought me life
[16:37] i know that it is
[16:42] [Music]
[16:53] but i will boast in jesus christ

[18:28] [Music]
[18:32] hardly a place
[18:35] for a king to be born
[18:38] he didn't choose someplace special
[18:42] to reveal his majesty

[18:50] he'll be born
[18:56] word be born
[18:59] in the manger of my heart
[19:05] [Music]
[19:22] in the manger
[19:24] [Music]
[19:33] not much
[19:38] a place
[19:40] for his word to unfold
[19:44] but if i'll just yield this vessel
[19:48] and let him have his way from glory to
[19:53] glory
[19:55] he'll change me day by day

[39:02] no matter where we walk in life that god
[39:04] will always be with us
[39:06] you know brother i was hearing brother
[39:07] branham and he said that in the tape a
[39:10] certain tape he said
[39:13] that that rock
[39:14] that moses struck
[39:16] when they were in need of water
[39:18] and god told moses
[39:20] to strike the rock
[39:22] and he did he's we know he did it twice
[39:24] they broke he broke the type
[39:27] because that rock was christ
[39:29] and
[39:30] he and the bible says in the new
[39:32] testament it says that
[39:34] that that rock
[39:35] followed them wherever they went
[39:38] and brother bannon said that that rock
[39:40] is christ that wherever we go
[39:44] he'll be there
[39:45] he'll be there when we fail
[39:47] he'll be there when we can't take
[39:49] another step he'll be there
[39:51] always
[39:52] we can draw from that water amen
[39:55] aren't you glad
[39:57] that that is ever present
[40:00] rock
[40:00] amen
[40:02] you know always with us no matter where
[40:04] we go he said i'll never leave you
[40:06] nor forsake you i'll be with you until
[40:08] the end of the age amen
[40:10] god bless you tonight and
[40:12] uh thank you for coming uh
[40:17] you took an effort to come today because
[40:20] of the rain
[40:22] and we had two storms coming in
[40:25] and we didn't expect that but uh
[40:27] we're here praise the lord amen
[40:30] your bibles tonight like to turn to
[40:33] mark
[40:34] chapter 12 verse 30 and 31. i'm getting
[40:38] a little bit of reverb back here bro
[40:39] jeremy could you maybe bring it down a
[40:41] little bit
[40:43] can you all hear me okay everybody can
[40:44] hear me fine okay
[40:48] mark 12
[40:49] verses 30 and 31.

[40:55] shalt love the lord thy god with all thy
[40:58] heart
[40:59] and with all thy soul
[41:01] and this is my focus tonight and with
[41:03] all thy mind
[41:05] and with all thy strength
[41:08] this is the first commandment
[41:11] and the second is like namely this thou
[41:13] shalt love thy neighbor
[41:15] as thyself
[41:16] there is none other commandment
[41:19] greater than these
[41:22] to love god
[41:23] with all we got
[41:25] including our mind
[41:27] now we're going to speak on the mind
[41:29] tonight a little bit
[41:32] my message tonight is the renewing of
[41:34] our mind
[41:37] our mind plays a great part you may be
[41:40] seated god bless you
[41:44] please have a word of prayer father just
[41:46] bless the word tonight lord and
[41:48] take away my nervousness lord
[41:51] and uh
[41:52] help us lord to get out of the way
[41:54] father you might speak to us tonight
[41:55] that we didn't come and gather in vain
[41:58] lord
[41:58] we know that your presence is here
[42:00] father have your way amongst us we pray
[42:02] in jesus name amen
[42:05] our mind plays a great part
[42:07] when it comes to believing the word of
[42:09] god
[42:11] brother ben talks about you know how we
[42:13] when we first meet the lord and that
[42:16] have our first experience with him and
[42:18] it's it's it's pretty much a mental
[42:20] concept conception that we have
[42:23] we have an understanding and
[42:25] and maybe we were walking a certain way
[42:27] and
[42:28] and and we heard the word we heard maybe
[42:30] we went to a church a church somewhere
[42:32] we heard the word and it caused us to
[42:34] make a decision for christ
[42:36] and it turned
[42:38] and we turned in our life and started
[42:40] walking a different path
[42:42] immediately
[42:43] and it it's a mental conception at first
[42:46] because it's it's a decision that we
[42:49] make mentally
[42:50] for the lord very important
[42:53] but we can't stay there we have to go on
[42:55] with you know to a baptism of the holy
[42:56] ghost we know that
[42:58] and also brother bran says something
[43:00] about the correct mental attitude
[43:03] trying to tell you tonight that our mind
[43:05] plays a great part
[43:07] in our walk with god
[43:09] we always give a
[43:11] lot say a lot about the heart and the
[43:13] soul and and that too but it starts with
[43:16] the mind
[43:17] and brother bran says the right mental
[43:20] attitude
[43:21] towards any promise of god
[43:23] will bring it to pass in your in your
[43:25] life
[43:26] so having the right correct correct
[43:28] mental attitude
[43:30] according uh about god's word and his
[43:33] promise
[43:34] in luke chapter 12 verse 21 29 excuse me
[43:38] 29 it says to seek ye not ye what ye
[43:41] shall eat
[43:42] or what you shall drink
[43:44] neither be ye of a doubtful mind
[43:48] so the scriptures they warn us about
[43:49] being doubtful
[43:51] when it comes to the word now brother
[43:52] bam taught us that that uh
[43:55] that there's only one sin that's to
[43:57] disbelieve god's word
[44:00] and and the smoking and the drinking and
[44:02] the and the adultery and everything it
[44:05] comes from disbelieving god's word are
[44:07] the attributes of sin
[44:09] but the real true sin is that we just
[44:11] disbelieve god's word
[44:13] and the bible admonishes us tells us
[44:16] don't be of a doubtful mind
[44:18] when it comes to the things of god we
[44:20] must believe
[44:22] to doubt god's word
[44:24] is to disbelieve his word and to
[44:26] disbelieve god's word is sin
[44:30] in the in the message brother branham
[44:32] preached on the greatest battle ever
[44:34] thought
[44:35] and i and if you haven't heard for a
[44:36] while i would tell you go back and
[44:38] listen to that again
[44:40] and and and be reading it that you're
[44:42] hearing that way you you get a
[44:43] proportion of what he's saying but it's
[44:45] a powerful
[44:46] powerful message
[44:48] because it's all right here
[44:51] it starts right here
[44:53] and it continues
[44:55] the battle that never never ends
[44:58] it will always be in our mind
[45:00] that's the battleground
[45:02] and brother man says this in the
[45:03] greatest battle ever fought on paragraph
[45:05] 41 he says listen you soldiers of the
[45:08] cross
[45:10] when you disbelieve one word one word of
[45:13] god's written bible
[45:15] you're disarmed
[45:17] you're disarmed you surrender
[45:20] he said you jelly fish
[45:22] put on the whole full armor of god
[45:25] amen we're in a battle he says
[45:28] and you have if you haven't noticed when
[45:30] you as you serve the lord you're in a
[45:32] battle
[45:34] we fight it every day
[45:38] what god said is true
[45:42] every man's word a lie
[45:45] that's why the bible tells us to put on
[45:46] the whole armor of god
[45:49] because we're in a battle
[45:51] and and brother brandon says that armor
[45:53] is spiritual
[45:55] it's a spiritual armor
[45:57] that we put on
[45:59] and we need to wear it every day
[46:01] because we need it
[46:03] he says but as soon as you listen to one
[46:06] thing
[46:07] that's his tactic
[46:09] you're disarmed you see we need to know
[46:12] the tactics of the enemy
[46:15] how does he come against you
[46:17] he comes into your mind
[46:20] and i'll tell you why in a minute but
[46:22] you know he's fighting for your mind
[46:24] and
[46:25] he has access to to your mind did you
[46:28] know that
[46:29] now he cannot read your mind
[46:31] brother brown said if you've got
[46:32] something planned
[46:34] and you say you want to fast on a
[46:35] certain day you're getting ready and
[46:37] don't tell nobody because satan will
[46:38] throw everything in your pathway to keep
[46:40] you from doing it
[46:42] as soon as you let it know he'll know
[46:45] and but one thing he can do he can put a
[46:47] thought in your mind
[46:49] and
[46:50] and the thing about that is you know
[46:52] brother brown told brother perry green
[46:53] one time he said
[46:55] he said i can't keep the birds flying
[46:57] over my head but i can sure keep from
[46:59] building the nest on my head
[47:02] and that's what it is he throws a
[47:03] thought in there to see what you'll do
[47:04] with it you could be sitting in church
[47:08] not even just thinking about the thing
[47:10] and also the most evil thought will come
[47:11] into your mind and if you don't know his
[47:13] tactics that'll throw you
[47:16] you think how can i be so evil to think
[47:18] this thought it's not your thought
[47:20] it's not yours it's
[47:22] his and that's what the bible says in
[47:25] the armor we're to have that shield of
[47:27] faith to ward off the wicked darts of
[47:30] the of the enemy
[47:32] that's what it does
[47:33] and and also we have the helmet of
[47:35] salvation which the you know which
[47:37] protects our head and our mind
[47:40] god's trying to protect us from these
[47:42] things and saying can throw that dart in
[47:44] there and you'll think it's your your
[47:46] thought it's not your thought you rebuke
[47:48] that thing
[47:49] and go on with god's thoughts
[47:53] the bible says we are to bring every
[47:54] every thought to the captivity of christ
[47:59] but as soon as you listen to one thing
[48:01] that's his tactic
[48:03] you're disarmed
[48:05] how many things did eve have to listen
[48:06] to
[48:08] one
[48:09] she was disarmed right then
[48:12] what the what what did the devil do
[48:15] swept listen to this
[48:17] swept right in through her mind
[48:20] into her spirit
[48:23] and there she was perverted
[48:25] he came in through her mind
[48:28] and into her spirit
[48:30] is that right he says she was perverted
[48:32] the very minute that she was disarmed
[48:34] when she disbelieved god's word
[48:37] see
[48:38] we we here we see his tactic
[48:41] in acts 17 11
[48:45] the bible says these were more noble
[48:48] than those in thessalonica
[48:51] in that they received the word with all
[48:53] readiness of mind
[48:56] and searched the scriptures daily
[48:59] whether those things were so when they
[49:01] received the word they received it first
[49:03] in their mind
[49:05] they received it and then they began to
[49:07] check on it and read and began to eat of
[49:09] the word and learn more and more as they
[49:11] went
[49:12] but they received it the bible says in
[49:14] readiness of mind
[49:17] there's a lot to our mind more than we
[49:19] think
[49:21] you know there's there's
[49:22] there's a there's what's called the
[49:24] subconscious mind
[49:26] and there is what is called the
[49:27] conscious mind
[49:28] the conscious
[49:30] and the subconscious minds
[49:32] are merely two spheres
[49:35] separate spheres
[49:37] of activity within your brain
[49:40] your conscious mind is the one you're
[49:42] using right now
[49:43] because we're conscious
[49:45] is is the rational or logical mind
[49:50] if i say
[49:51] 2 plus 2 is 5
[49:54] your conscious mind will catch that
[49:57] because that's not right that's not
[49:58] logical
[50:00] two plus two is four
[50:02] but in your subconscious if you if you
[50:06] say two plus two is five your
[50:08] subconscious receives it
[50:10] doesn't
[50:11] doesn't question it
[50:12] that's what our subconscious mind does
[50:15] it's now your conscious mind is a
[50:17] rational or logical mind whereas your
[50:20] subconscious mind is the animal like
[50:23] brain within humans
[50:25] without any conscious choice on your
[50:27] part
[50:28] your heart keeps pumping blood
[50:31] your body knows to sweat
[50:33] and your temperature is regulated you
[50:36] don't have to stop and think these
[50:37] things better
[50:38] well better hold on brother don't talk
[50:40] to you i got to take a breath no you
[50:42] don't you don't think about it your body
[50:44] just does it automatically
[50:46] because your subconscious mind is in
[50:48] control of all that
[50:50] you don't have to stop and think well i
[50:51] got to make my heart beat no it beats
[50:53] because it's all being controlled
[50:56] by your subconscious subconscious mind
[51:00] now your body knows to sweat your
[51:02] temperatures regularly these are all
[51:03] examples
[51:05] of the functions
[51:06] that although may seem as if they just
[51:08] happen
[51:10] are actually the result of your
[51:12] subconscious mental processes hard at
[51:16] work
[51:17] many people never think they have
[51:20] a subconscious mind
[51:23] although they certainly have to think
[51:25] with it
[51:26] your subconscious mind is very powerful
[51:30] first of all it runs all the organs in
[51:32] your body
[51:33] you don't have to think about it but
[51:36] there's something else about the
[51:37] subconscious mind that we're going to
[51:38] find out tonight
[51:40] now it's very powerful it makes up a
[51:41] great percentage of your mental
[51:44] processes
[51:46] even though you are unaware of it
[51:48] your subconscious mind is easily
[51:51] impressed upon
[51:54] by the thoughts and mental focus of the
[51:56] conscious mind
[51:58] in other words if you tell your
[52:00] subconscious that two plus two is is
[52:02] eight
[52:03] then your subconscious will receive it
[52:05] doesn't question it it just takes it
[52:07] right in
[52:10] your subconscious is that reason
[52:13] it does not try to figure it out it
[52:15] simply reacts to and follows the
[52:17] instructions and guidance of the
[52:19] conscious mind
[52:21] your subconscious
[52:23] can be described as a bed of soil
[52:27] that accepts any kind of seed
[52:30] whether good or bad
[52:33] that's in your subconscious
[52:35] we can feed that subconscious all the
[52:38] filth out there
[52:40] all the things the world
[52:41] everything hollywood has to offer
[52:44] and we and we don't realize that we're
[52:46] taking that in and our subconscious mind
[52:48] doesn't
[52:50] doesn't uh question it
[52:53] and and so and so we have to be careful
[52:55] what we feed into because it becomes a a
[52:58] a bed of soil that our seeds are coming
[53:01] in
[53:02] and the time will come in our life when
[53:04] something tragic happens or something
[53:06] comes up and we need faith right now we
[53:08] need god on the scene and we call upon
[53:11] god and we begin to pull from for what
[53:13] is our subconscious and all we have is a
[53:16] bunch of seeds that shouldn't be there
[53:18] to begin with
[53:19] we've got nothing to pull from
[53:25] negative
[53:27] destructive
[53:29] thoughts
[53:30] oh let me say this your mental thoughts
[53:32] are active
[53:34] they are seeds
[53:36] to your subconscious
[53:38] so everything we you and let's look at
[53:41] our subconscious like like a computer
[53:43] like a hard drive
[53:44] and you're downloading into your hard
[53:46] drive all the time
[53:48] right now as we're as i'm standing here
[53:50] you're watching me maybe somebody will
[53:52] move somebody will cough and you you
[53:54] know the cough you know the person
[53:55] somebody might say something behind you
[53:57] and you know because you know the voice
[53:59] you know who that is you get all this
[54:01] data
[54:02] that's unbelievable is coming in
[54:04] constantly all the time into our mind
[54:07] as you're driving down the road you see
[54:08] this car that car that car behind you a
[54:11] person walking down the street you're
[54:12] catching all those things
[54:14] without even thinking about it
[54:16] you're hearing the radio or someone's
[54:18] talking to you they're sitting next to
[54:19] you you're in a conversation or maybe
[54:21] you get a call and and hopefully you've
[54:23] got hands hands what they call hands off
[54:25] on your on your phone you can receive it
[54:28] but all these all this data is
[54:30] constantly coming in
[54:31] and your mind is always receiving data
[54:34] constantly
[54:36] and sometimes negative destructive
[54:39] thoughts
[54:40] as a result of anxiety or depression
[54:44] continue to work negatively in your
[54:46] subconscious
[54:49] though your conscience has already
[54:50] forgotten about it whatever data you you
[54:53] downloaded into your computer
[54:55] it's still there
[54:58] and that subconscious is receiving it
[55:00] as truth
[55:04] sooner or later they surface
[55:06] listen to this now
[55:08] to take shape as an outer experience
[55:11] that corresponds to their content
[55:14] whatever it is you're downloading
[55:16] whatever it is you're you're feeding on
[55:18] during the day
[55:20] good bad or in whatever
[55:22] your subconscious is receiving it
[55:26] and one thing about seeds
[55:29] they always bring a harvest
[55:33] we feed the wrong things into our mind
[55:37] it'll bring a harvest in our mind as
[55:39] well and in our lives
[55:42] the old saying be careful what you wish
[55:43] for
[55:45] be careful what you're afraid of
[55:47] now brother bran said that
[55:49] be careful what you fear because it'll
[55:51] come upon you
[55:53] those fears that are there
[55:55] they're being fed to the subconscious by
[55:57] your conscious mind
[56:00] in romans chapter 1 verse 27 to 32
[56:05] it says and likewise also the man
[56:07] leaving the natural use of the women
[56:10] burned in their lust one toward another
[56:12] man with man working that which is
[56:14] unseemly and receiving in themselves
[56:18] that recompense of their error which was
[56:20] meat
[56:21] and even as they did not like to retain
[56:23] god in their knowledge
[56:26] they didn't want to hear about god
[56:28] you know i find that many times when
[56:30] people they don't want to hear about god
[56:33] we have people in our church that come
[56:35] to visit our church
[56:36] they walk out of there in tears
[56:39] and they say we'll be back and they
[56:40] don't ever come back
[56:42] because there's something holding them
[56:43] back
[56:44] i've got a brother-in-law that he's
[56:46] living with us right now for a few days
[56:48] anyway he came from california he's
[56:50] almost 60 years old
[56:52] all his life has been about the streets
[56:55] the drug
[56:56] scene he's had such close calls to his
[56:59] life
[57:01] numerous it's a miracle he's alive today
[57:04] but his life
[57:06] i try to speak to him on the things the
[57:07] lord
[57:08] and he and he won't even let me talk
[57:10] because he knows more than i do about
[57:12] anything even about god
[57:16] and he he came to our church last sunday
[57:19] and i think that's probably the first
[57:21] time he ever darkened the door of a
[57:22] church other than a catholic church
[57:24] where you don't learn anything
[57:26] but at least in a church like this
[57:28] you'll learn something
[57:30] you're gonna if you come in with the
[57:32] right mind you're gonna you're gonna
[57:33] you're gonna get the word
[57:35] and and so
[57:36] i think it was the first time here at
[57:37] dawkins a real church
[57:39] i mean the church of god
[57:41] and
[57:42] and i was thinking about that you know
[57:44] you know all his life
[57:47] his hard drive
[57:49] he's got all these seeds of just that
[57:51] kind of a life
[57:54] you know just drugs and
[57:57] and cursing and and drinking and
[57:59] adultery and
[58:01] people that's all they feed themselves
[58:03] on
[58:04] that's all they eat all day and their
[58:06] mind is is that's what they're full of
[58:10] if we have problems and we're trying to
[58:12] we're trying to read the bible we're
[58:14] trying to we're going to church we're
[58:15] hearing the word and and we try to stay
[58:17] away from the things of the world but
[58:19] but even then
[58:20] sometimes we hear the wrong things
[58:23] or we see the wrong things
[58:26] and then we have to deal with it brother
[58:27] i remember brother green say be careful
[58:29] of those uh pictures those magazines or
[58:32] whatever they got you know he says you
[58:33] see that
[58:35] to get it out of your mind remember
[58:36] we're going to talk about that you you
[58:38] get that thing out of your mind you can
[58:40] have a trouble
[58:41] but yet people will feed on stuff like
[58:43] that
[58:44] constantly
[58:46] constantly feeding on that
[58:48] no wonder they can't walk they're having
[58:50] trouble with their walk with god
[58:52] we have to be so careful
[58:54] what we feed our minds
[58:57] and even as they did not like to retain
[58:59] god in their knowledge god gave them
[59:01] over to a reprobate mind
[59:05] what is a reprobate mind god just gave
[59:07] him over in other words he'd give up
[59:09] with him
[59:11] and he and he gave him more to a
[59:13] reprobate mind as a degenerate mind
[59:17] no good
[59:19] nothing good can come out of it
[59:21] no matter whether their heart and their
[59:23] soul as as as brother branham said that
[59:25] when he came when satan came into eve's
[59:27] mind he went right straight and he
[59:30] perverted her
[59:33] and the people right now they're being
[59:35] perverted they're all the way down to
[59:37] their soul
[59:39] by the things of this world
[59:42] we should always be on guard
[59:44] and even as they did not like to retain
[59:46] god in their knowledge god gave them
[59:47] over to reprobate mind
[59:49] to do those things which are not
[59:51] convenient
[59:52] being filled
[59:55] where
[59:56] their mind
[59:58] in their mind
[1:00:00] with all unrighteousness
[1:00:02] fornication wickedness covetousness
[1:00:06] maliciousness full of envy and murder
[1:00:08] and debate deceit malignity whispers
[1:00:11] backbiters
[1:00:13] haters of god
[1:00:15] men who will jill said put their fists
[1:00:17] against the heavens because they hate
[1:00:19] god
[1:00:20] a hatred of god
[1:00:22] they hate the name of jesus
[1:00:25] it offends them
[1:00:26] everywhere you know there's places now
[1:00:28] where you can't even name jesus in the
[1:00:30] in the graduations they don't want to
[1:00:32] hear the name of jesus
[1:00:34] you can mention muhammad and muslim and
[1:00:36] all that all you want but don't mention
[1:00:38] jesus
[1:00:40] at one time i don't know about now but
[1:00:41] the one time the chaplains of the army
[1:00:43] and the navy were not allowed
[1:00:45] to when they entered their prayer to say
[1:00:47] in the name of jesus they don't want to
[1:00:49] hear that name
[1:00:52] hateful
[1:00:53] haters of god despiteful proud boasters
[1:00:56] adventures of evil things disobedient to
[1:00:59] parents without understanding
[1:01:02] no understanding whatsoever
[1:01:06] of the spiritual things of god
[1:01:08] covenant breakers without natural
[1:01:10] affection implacable and unmerciful
[1:01:13] who knowing the judgment of god
[1:01:15] that they which commits their sins are
[1:01:17] worthy of death
[1:01:19] not only do the same but have pleasure
[1:01:20] in them to do them
[1:01:23] in philippians
[1:01:24] chapter 2 verse 5 to 8
[1:01:28] here
[1:01:28] paul writes
[1:01:30] let this mind
[1:01:32] be in you
[1:01:34] which was also in christ jesus
[1:01:37] who being in the form of god
[1:01:40] thought it not robbery
[1:01:42] to be equal
[1:01:43] with god
[1:01:45] and made himself of no reputation and
[1:01:47] took upon him the form of a servant and
[1:01:50] was made in the likeness of men god
[1:01:53] condescended down
[1:01:56] in humility
[1:01:58] let this mind
[1:02:00] which was in christ being you
[1:02:04] to be humble before the lord
[1:02:08] to love the lord with all that we have
[1:02:11] and being found in fashion verse 8 he
[1:02:14] humbled himself
[1:02:16] and became obedient unto death
[1:02:20] even the death of the cross
[1:02:23] let this mind
[1:02:25] be not the mind of the world
[1:02:27] but the mind of christ
[1:02:31] in the spoken word is the original seed
[1:02:33] paragraph 178
[1:02:36] brother bran says now let's go back now
[1:02:38] and pick it up again come down for
[1:02:40] something remember what last sunday's
[1:02:42] service was
[1:02:43] the gate
[1:02:44] to the soul
[1:02:47] you remember now there is a wound there
[1:02:49] is a womb of the physical
[1:02:52] there is a womb
[1:02:54] for the spirit
[1:02:56] there is a spiritual womb
[1:02:59] and a physical
[1:03:00] wound and the mind is the womb
[1:03:05] of the spirit
[1:03:07] that's why we should have to we it's
[1:03:09] imperative we guard
[1:03:11] our mind
[1:03:13] it is a wound it is the entryway
[1:03:17] it is the gate
[1:03:18] as brother man says here
[1:03:21] to the soul
[1:03:23] you open up your mind to the things of
[1:03:26] of the world
[1:03:28] you're making it you're making a channel
[1:03:31] for satan to come in
[1:03:33] and begin to pollute
[1:03:36] your mind your subconscious
[1:03:41] there is
[1:03:42] a spiritual wound
[1:03:44] and the physical wound
[1:03:46] and the mind is the womb of the spirit
[1:03:49] it is the gateway
[1:03:52] to your soul
[1:03:54] that's why the battle greatest bad
[1:03:56] liberal fought is right here
[1:03:59] that's why we suit up in the morning
[1:04:00] with the armor of god
[1:04:02] put on that spiritual armor
[1:04:05] because we need it
[1:04:07] because we come out it's like
[1:04:09] it's like when when there was a a city
[1:04:11] was being
[1:04:12] attacked
[1:04:14] the soldiers would come out of the city
[1:04:15] and file out through the gate and they
[1:04:17] would stand in front of the city walls
[1:04:19] to meet the enemy
[1:04:21] guarding that city
[1:04:23] because if they if they fell that city
[1:04:26] would be taken
[1:04:27] and that city today is your soul
[1:04:30] and the battlefront is right here in
[1:04:32] your mind and satan is continually
[1:04:35] trying to break bring something coming
[1:04:38] in one way or coming in another
[1:04:40] he doesn't give up he don't he is 24 7.
[1:04:44] he's always knocking at the door trying
[1:04:46] to get in
[1:04:50] in hebrews 4 11 the bible says let us
[1:04:53] labor therefore to enter into
[1:04:55] that rest
[1:04:57] lest any man fall
[1:04:58] after the same example of unbelief for
[1:05:01] the word of god is quick and powerful
[1:05:03] how many believe that means it's alive
[1:05:06] quick means alive the word of god is
[1:05:08] alive and powerful and sharper than any
[1:05:11] two-witch's sword piercing even to the
[1:05:14] dividing asunder of soul and spirit
[1:05:19] and of the joints and marrow and there's
[1:05:22] a discerner of the thoughts and intents
[1:05:24] of the heart
[1:05:26] what this word it goes deep inside your
[1:05:28] soul
[1:05:30] it wants to come in to live in you
[1:05:33] that word wants to take take control of
[1:05:35] you
[1:05:37] that you surrender to that word believe
[1:05:39] the word amen
[1:05:41] let that word be downloaded into your
[1:05:43] hard drive every day
[1:05:48] it's a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:05:50] intents of the heart not just your
[1:05:52] thoughts but your intents
[1:05:55] amen
[1:05:56] what you intend to do
[1:05:58] maybe sometime before he becomes a
[1:06:00] thought
[1:06:01] and then becomes actions after that but
[1:06:04] the word of god is a discerner
[1:06:07] it goes deep inside
[1:06:09] the believer
[1:06:10] that's what we want the word of god
[1:06:13] not just not just coming in one ear
[1:06:15] going out the other as too many do
[1:06:18] we need that word to penetrate
[1:06:21] deep into our heart and to our soul
[1:06:23] now we have to understand that
[1:06:25] brother bram taught us that there are
[1:06:27] three realms that we deal with here
[1:06:30] there's a body realm the spirit realm
[1:06:32] and the soul
[1:06:34] in the body
[1:06:35] the body is is controlled by five senses
[1:06:38] as we know
[1:06:39] this is how we touch the world around us
[1:06:42] i know that this if i close my eyes i
[1:06:44] know this pulpit is here because i can
[1:06:46] feel it
[1:06:47] because i have a sense of touch
[1:06:49] to feel it
[1:06:51] i have a sense of sight i can see you
[1:06:53] you can see me
[1:06:54] you can hear me
[1:06:56] so we have these senses that we touch
[1:06:58] the world around us with and the spirit
[1:07:01] in your spirit
[1:07:03] brother bran says tells us that we have
[1:07:06] five senses as well
[1:07:08] and i remember it as my car m-i-c-a-r
[1:07:11] memory imagination conscious affections
[1:07:14] and reasoning
[1:07:15] and that's that's the the senses of the
[1:07:18] spirit
[1:07:19] of your spirit
[1:07:21] and satan will come in and he has access
[1:07:24] to your body
[1:07:25] and he has access also to your spirit
[1:07:29] he can come in and bring a thought a
[1:07:32] memory of past sin
[1:07:36] he'll bring something lit and then you
[1:07:38] got to be careful because imagination
[1:07:40] will take over on that
[1:07:42] and before you know your your thoughts
[1:07:44] are going somewhere it shouldn't be
[1:07:45] going
[1:07:46] he can use these things as his tools
[1:07:50] that's why we stand guard
[1:07:52] and also in the soul
[1:07:55] there's only there once one sense and
[1:07:57] it's called faith
[1:08:00] or the lack of it
[1:08:03] either is faith or it's no faith
[1:08:06] either there's faith or it's empty
[1:08:09] we need faith amen but now we know that
[1:08:11] faith is a gift of god
[1:08:14] you can't go and just say well i want
[1:08:15] faith no god's got to give it to you
[1:08:18] it's given to us by grace but it is a
[1:08:20] gift of god
[1:08:22] that's why there's some that can never
[1:08:23] hear the gospel they've got nothing
[1:08:26] to grasp with there's nothing to respond
[1:08:30] the faith is already there
[1:08:32] laying there dormant
[1:08:33] waiting to hear that word
[1:08:35] and when that word comes to something on
[1:08:37] the inside the response to that word
[1:08:40] that's why many will list hear it and
[1:08:42] just walk away and say it's a bunch of
[1:08:43] nonsense
[1:08:45] but there's got to be faith there
[1:08:48] there was a time one time when jesus met
[1:08:50] a man and
[1:08:51] in in mark 9 23
[1:08:55] jesus said unto him if thou cast believe
[1:08:58] all things are possible to him to
[1:09:00] believeth
[1:09:02] and straightway the father of the child
[1:09:04] cried out and said with tears he was
[1:09:07] sincere
[1:09:08] he said lord i believe
[1:09:11] help thou my unbelief
[1:09:15] and i ask you a question can we believe
[1:09:17] and yet not believe
[1:09:20] i believe with our conscious mind
[1:09:22] tonight when you say i believe
[1:09:24] i believe i believe
[1:09:26] but what about our subconscious
[1:09:29] in deep inside of us
[1:09:31] this man had there was there was a uh uh
[1:09:36] something was raging within him that was
[1:09:38] contrary one to another because he was
[1:09:40] saying i believe
[1:09:42] yet he's saying help my unbelief
[1:09:45] you remember brother branham saying many
[1:09:47] times how that people would come and
[1:09:48] he'd say i believe i believe i can be
[1:09:51] healed and brother bran could look into
[1:09:52] their life and and know that they didn't
[1:09:54] have the faith
[1:09:56] to believe
[1:09:58] yet they said they profess that they
[1:10:00] believe but there's an unbelief there
[1:10:03] somewhere
[1:10:04] we've allowed unbelief
[1:10:06] to come into that hard drive
[1:10:10] in in the greatest battle ever five
[1:10:11] brother brandon says you've got your
[1:10:13] senses
[1:10:14] see taste feel smell hear they're all
[1:10:17] right
[1:10:18] but don't trust them
[1:10:21] unless they agree with the word
[1:10:23] even how you feel
[1:10:26] the bible says we're by his stripes
[1:10:27] we're healed
[1:10:29] you may not feel it but you don't you
[1:10:31] don't go by your feelings
[1:10:33] you go by about what his word said
[1:10:35] you don't trust your feelings
[1:10:38] he said they're all right but if you
[1:10:39] they disagree with the word don't listen
[1:10:41] to them
[1:10:43] now imaginations and consciousness and
[1:10:44] memories reasonings reasonings and
[1:10:47] affection they're all right if they
[1:10:49] agree with the word
[1:10:51] but if your affection doesn't agree with
[1:10:53] the word get rid of it
[1:10:55] you blow a flu right quick
[1:10:59] if your reasoning
[1:11:01] disagrees with a word get away from it
[1:11:03] that's right
[1:11:05] your memory if your imaginations if
[1:11:07] you're conscious anything disagrees with
[1:11:09] that that what's on the inside get rid
[1:11:12] of it it blows the flu he says
[1:11:15] we need to open up the channels with god
[1:11:17] and and get those things emptied out or
[1:11:20] or or cleaned out so we can have a
[1:11:22] channel with god
[1:11:25] in the greatest battle or fight he said
[1:11:26] what's the matter
[1:11:28] you had to open the channel first
[1:11:31] you have to open the channel
[1:11:33] i have to open the channel
[1:11:35] you say god come over no no we open the
[1:11:37] channels
[1:11:39] you've got to get the soldier the holy
[1:11:40] spirit placed at the battlefront to take
[1:11:43] god's word
[1:11:45] he is the word and he stands there and
[1:11:47] there's nothing going to stop it then
[1:11:49] every one of the other channels is
[1:11:50] cleared out
[1:11:53] like
[1:11:54] just like the old boiler with the flu
[1:11:56] stopped up
[1:11:57] and
[1:11:58] you put a fire it'll blow the thing up
[1:12:01] that's what's the matter with so many
[1:12:02] blowing up christians because they don't
[1:12:04] get clean they don't clean the channels
[1:12:07] out we got channels that are clogged up
[1:12:10] sometimes it might be it might be
[1:12:12] bitterness
[1:12:14] or hatred towards somebody or
[1:12:16] unforgiveness or it might be a hidden
[1:12:19] sin or if it's anything it could be
[1:12:21] anything
[1:12:22] and it clogs up the channel and god can
[1:12:26] come through
[1:12:28] we have to open up the channels that's
[1:12:30] why we have to open them up
[1:12:32] and maybe it's something we did back in
[1:12:33] the past we've never gone to make it
[1:12:35] right and god will hold it against us
[1:12:38] we never you've got to examine your life
[1:12:42] search me your god and know
[1:12:44] my heart within
[1:12:46] try me your savior
[1:12:48] amen
[1:12:49] that we have in our prayer life
[1:12:52] we have to have a prayer life
[1:12:54] where we come to god we say lord is
[1:12:55] there anything in my life
[1:12:57] and let god speak to you
[1:13:00] and when it comes to your mind deal with
[1:13:02] it
[1:13:03] get it out of your life
[1:13:05] open up that channel
[1:13:10] that's why we have so many blown up
[1:13:12] christians because they don't clean the
[1:13:14] channels out
[1:13:15] they go down into the inside you've got
[1:13:18] to get clean it conscious memory
[1:13:20] thoughts
[1:13:22] laying aside everything and coming from
[1:13:24] the inside out with that unadulterated
[1:13:27] word of god that it's the truth
[1:13:30] no matter if ten thousand died on this
[1:13:32] side
[1:13:33] today trusting
[1:13:34] ten thousand died on that side tomorrow
[1:13:36] trusting
[1:13:38] that has got nothing to do with me
[1:13:41] i'm the individual
[1:13:43] amen
[1:13:44] i'm the one that's trusting
[1:13:47] don't be looking out there see what's
[1:13:48] going on out there
[1:13:50] just keep your eyes on christ amen
[1:13:52] it's just you in christ
[1:13:54] it's not you and all the people you know
[1:13:56] it's just you and christ it's not you
[1:13:58] and your husband and chris no it's you
[1:14:00] and christ
[1:14:02] not you and daddy and mommy no it's you
[1:14:04] in christ
[1:14:05] keep your eyes on him
[1:14:08] amen i'm the one that's trusting i'm the
[1:14:10] one that believes it
[1:14:13] we gotta start putting new seeds into
[1:14:15] our hard drive
[1:14:17] believing god
[1:14:19] the promises of god
[1:14:22] second corinthians 10 3 one of my
[1:14:24] favorite
[1:14:25] uh
[1:14:26] scriptures for though we walk in the
[1:14:27] flesh
[1:14:28] we warn that after the flesh for the
[1:14:30] weapons of our warfare
[1:14:31] are not carnal but mighty through god
[1:14:35] we've got to believe that
[1:14:36] that the weapons of our warfare are
[1:14:38] mighty through it now i found out that
[1:14:39] prayer is a weapon the word of god is a
[1:14:42] weapon now i found out that love is a
[1:14:44] weapon
[1:14:45] god has placed weapons in our hands so
[1:14:47] we can fight the battle friends
[1:14:49] we are that's why we are more than
[1:14:51] conquerors through him that loved us
[1:14:54] so
[1:14:55] but mighty through god to the pulling
[1:14:56] down of strongholds
[1:14:59] amen
[1:15:00] because some of us may have a strong for
[1:15:02] satan has got a stronghold on you
[1:15:05] what is a stronghold he's got a hold of
[1:15:07] you and he's not going to let go
[1:15:09] that's what brother brandon said you
[1:15:10] know get those get that sin out of your
[1:15:12] life as long as you got sin in your life
[1:15:14] satan's got a stronghold on you and you
[1:15:16] wherever you go you're going to drag him
[1:15:18] with you
[1:15:20] because he's got a stronghold
[1:15:22] but the weapons of our warfare are not
[1:15:24] incarnal carnal but mighty through god
[1:15:28] to the pulling down of strongholds
[1:15:31] casting down imaginations
[1:15:33] that's the senses of the spirit
[1:15:36] and every high thing that exalted itself
[1:15:38] against the knowledge of god which is
[1:15:40] the word of god
[1:15:44] and bringing into captivity every
[1:15:46] thought
[1:15:47] there's where the battle is at
[1:15:49] bring
[1:15:50] apprehending every thought
[1:15:53] constantly watching our because as we go
[1:15:56] through the day
[1:15:57] what did i say last time i had 50 000
[1:15:59] thoughts in a day
[1:16:01] and her sister is about 150 000.
[1:16:06] thoughts go through our mind in just one
[1:16:08] day
[1:16:10] how many of those thoughts
[1:16:12] can if we allow them will lead us astray
[1:16:16] bringing every thought
[1:16:18] that's why it's a continual never-ending
[1:16:22] battle
[1:16:23] but we're promised the victory
[1:16:26] if we just follow god's prescription
[1:16:29] if we follow god's commandments
[1:16:32] and the things he's shown he shows us
[1:16:34] through the preaching of the word
[1:16:36] through the ministry
[1:16:38] and what god shows you at home and as
[1:16:40] you read the bible is you pray god's
[1:16:42] leading you the holy spirit is leading
[1:16:44] you revealing things to you that maybe
[1:16:47] you didn't know before
[1:16:49] amen
[1:16:51] greatest battle ever fought the
[1:16:52] brotherhood says if one little aorta of
[1:16:55] god's word was disbelieved
[1:16:57] caused all this trouble how are we going
[1:16:59] to get back disbelieving the word you
[1:17:02] can't do it you got to shut off all the
[1:17:04] other things conscious memories
[1:17:06] reasoning
[1:17:07] all these other things casting down
[1:17:08] reasonings we don't reason
[1:17:11] about it all nothing at all we just
[1:17:13] accept the word upon the basis
[1:17:17] god said so
[1:17:18] amen
[1:17:20] that's what we need to download into a
[1:17:22] into our our hard drive god said so
[1:17:25] i believe god it shall be done even as
[1:17:29] you said trust and obey look up and say
[1:17:32] i believe i believe god
[1:17:35] amen
[1:17:36] began to download
[1:17:38] those things which which which uh that's
[1:17:40] why the bible says that
[1:17:42] our all our thoughts uh i can't think of
[1:17:44] the scripture comes to my mind right now
[1:17:48] that that they be a virtue they be if
[1:17:50] they be of power that you know think of
[1:17:52] these things
[1:17:54] i wish i had that scripture i might have
[1:17:56] here somewhere i i didn't get to the end
[1:17:58] of this this morning when i preached it
[1:18:00] but uh
[1:18:01] at my church
[1:18:02] but you know this is brother brandon
[1:18:04] says now i'm going to get ahead of
[1:18:06] myself here
[1:18:08] conscious memories reasonings and all
[1:18:09] these other things casting down reasons
[1:18:11] we don't reason about it at all that's
[1:18:13] nothing at all we might just accept the
[1:18:15] word upon the basis god said so and it
[1:18:18] sets the stream between you and god
[1:18:22] did you hear that you you you began to
[1:18:25] say god said so you began to believe it
[1:18:28] and it sets a stream
[1:18:31] between you and god
[1:18:33] what's it doing is opening up a channel
[1:18:36] of unbelief
[1:18:38] maybe unbelief was clogging that channel
[1:18:40] and you began to say lord i believe you
[1:18:42] your word is true your word doesn't fail
[1:18:45] god your word will carry me through your
[1:18:48] word is powerful your word is mighty
[1:18:50] your word is alive lord i believe your
[1:18:52] word
[1:18:53] amen
[1:18:54] every channel comes open between you and
[1:18:57] god then
[1:18:58] there's the battle
[1:19:00] brother brown says
[1:19:02] the very first front line
[1:19:04] amen
[1:19:06] you remember how that there was a man
[1:19:07] named called john ryan who was blind
[1:19:11] and he came to god or to brother brown
[1:19:13] excuse me and and and brother branham uh
[1:19:16] uh prayed for him
[1:19:18] and so he went on his way and he was
[1:19:20] still blind and he comes back he comes
[1:19:23] back to brother brown i don't know if it
[1:19:24] was a prayer line or outside but he
[1:19:26] comes back and he and he says brother
[1:19:28] would you you will you pray for me and
[1:19:30] brother ben looks at him he says brother
[1:19:31] i already prayed for you once
[1:19:33] and the man says yeah but you said you
[1:19:35] said i was healed
[1:19:37] and i can't see
[1:19:38] he said you said you believed
[1:19:41] and so he said what do i do brother
[1:19:43] branham
[1:19:44] he says start confessing
[1:19:46] your healing
[1:19:47] and thanking god for your healing what
[1:19:49] was he what was he telling him to do
[1:19:51] start putting some new seeds in the hard
[1:19:53] drive
[1:19:55] amen and he began to cry out and say
[1:19:58] praise the lord i'm healed they have
[1:20:00] some meetings later on and they're
[1:20:02] having some meetings there in a certain
[1:20:03] place and he was up on the balcony
[1:20:05] brother brown says and brother brown
[1:20:07] would be right in the middle of his
[1:20:08] sermon
[1:20:09] and up and he'd just jump up in the
[1:20:11] balcony and scream at the top of his
[1:20:13] lungs praise the lord i'm healed
[1:20:16] i can see
[1:20:17] praise god
[1:20:19] and so the the ushers are
[1:20:21] came to him brother brandon what should
[1:20:23] we do with him he's disturbing the
[1:20:25] service should we go down and go up
[1:20:26] there and and uh and tell him to quiet
[1:20:29] down and brother bran said no
[1:20:31] i told him to do that
[1:20:33] just let you see the grace of the man
[1:20:35] how many other ministers would say shut
[1:20:37] that man up
[1:20:39] but brother god said no i told him to do
[1:20:40] that he's doing what i told him to do
[1:20:42] let him do it
[1:20:43] hey man
[1:20:44] have a little bit of a a mercy and grace
[1:20:47] for somebody amen
[1:20:49] tolerance is the word
[1:20:52] sometimes we can't tolerate each other
[1:20:54] god gave us mercy and grace so realizing
[1:20:56] what god how much god has forgiven us
[1:20:59] why can't we tolerate and forgive each
[1:21:01] other
[1:21:02] amen and hide a multitude of sins
[1:21:04] because that's what love does love is a
[1:21:06] weapon
[1:21:07] and with that weapon we can hide a whole
[1:21:09] lot of sins amen and love everybody and
[1:21:13] be filled with love amen
[1:21:15] so he told him
[1:21:17] to go ahead and
[1:21:18] just do that and he wasn't
[1:21:21] and they say according to the story you
[1:21:22] know the story he was out there selling
[1:21:24] papers you on the on the corner
[1:21:26] somewhere extra extra read all about it
[1:21:29] and and then he'd scream out you say
[1:21:31] praise the lord out there on the street
[1:21:34] i'm healed
[1:21:35] i can see
[1:21:37] and so they were making fun of him
[1:21:39] and you know the story there at the
[1:21:41] barber he goes and sits down in the
[1:21:42] barber the barber starts asking well
[1:21:44] john i heard you you can see down he's
[1:21:46] still blind
[1:21:48] and right there in that barber chair he
[1:21:49] says yes praise god i can see and his
[1:21:52] eyes came open right there
[1:21:54] amen
[1:21:55] that unbelief began to ebb away all the
[1:21:57] unbelief that was in that he had
[1:21:59] downloaded how much have we downloaded
[1:22:01] in our life
[1:22:02] amen
[1:22:04] how much how many doubts
[1:22:06] how much unbelief
[1:22:08] oh
[1:22:09] god can't uh maybe god can't maybe this
[1:22:12] isn't for me
[1:22:13] maybe this healing is not for me
[1:22:16] in the greatest battle brother man says
[1:22:18] we are taught in james 4 7 to resist the
[1:22:20] devil
[1:22:21] and he just won't walk away but he will
[1:22:23] flee
[1:22:25] resist the devil
[1:22:27] now he says how do you resist the devil
[1:22:30] isn't that a good question
[1:22:31] how do you resist him
[1:22:33] the same way our chief captain told us
[1:22:36] to do it take the word of god
[1:22:40] that's how you resist the devil by the
[1:22:42] word of god
[1:22:44] the chief captain told us just how to do
[1:22:47] it we don't realize as brother man says
[1:22:50] a weapon god has placed in our hands
[1:22:53] the word of god is powerful
[1:22:57] satan knows that
[1:22:59] and he tries us to get us to disbelieve
[1:23:02] our weapon
[1:23:04] he gets us he tries to get us to
[1:23:06] disbelieve our prayer
[1:23:09] it's going to get anywhere
[1:23:11] because every time we kneel down we
[1:23:13] might be as weak as we can be but when
[1:23:15] we get on our knees all our hell begins
[1:23:17] to tremble and shake
[1:23:19] and he don't like that so he tries and
[1:23:22] it's still in our mind
[1:23:23] and into our hard drive
[1:23:26] now all my prayers don't don't get
[1:23:28] anywhere
[1:23:29] you see we've downloaded that into our
[1:23:31] hard drive
[1:23:33] it's time to begin to believe the
[1:23:35] weapons that god has placed in our hands
[1:23:37] whether it's the word of god whether
[1:23:39] it's love
[1:23:40] when love projects it can even control
[1:23:42] nature
[1:23:44] we know the testimonies of the bowl and
[1:23:46] of the hornets it was love they did that
[1:23:49] it's a power of love
[1:23:52] amen
[1:23:54] you take the word of god
[1:23:56] amen and you resist the devil with the
[1:23:58] word of god
[1:24:01] what are we doing then
[1:24:03] what are we trying to do we need to
[1:24:05] reprogram our mind
[1:24:07] to accept without reservation
[1:24:11] without doubt
[1:24:13] what god's word says we are
[1:24:16] reprogramming the hard drive
[1:24:19] of our life
[1:24:21] our mind has been programmed listen
[1:24:24] to doubt
[1:24:26] to disbelieve
[1:24:27] to question
[1:24:29] to be uncertain
[1:24:32] to wonder
[1:24:34] is this for me
[1:24:35] will god really do this for me
[1:24:39] he's gotten us in that place
[1:24:42] is this promise for me
[1:24:45] will god really heal me
[1:24:48] am i really saved
[1:24:51] can i really overcome this thing in my
[1:24:53] life
[1:24:55] will god
[1:24:56] fulfill his promise
[1:24:59] to me or in me
[1:25:02] amen
[1:25:04] in ephesians 4 23
[1:25:06] and 24
[1:25:08] and be renewed
[1:25:10] in the spirit of your mind
[1:25:14] and that ye put on the new man
[1:25:16] which after god is created in
[1:25:19] righteousness
[1:25:20] and true holiness
[1:25:22] put on
[1:25:23] the mind of christ amen
[1:25:27] brother braham gave us an analogy and
[1:25:29] i'll be closing a few minutes
[1:25:32] of the little eaglet
[1:25:34] that's inside the shell
[1:25:37] and this in
[1:25:38] darkness you might find yourself right
[1:25:41] now
[1:25:42] maybe in a dark place
[1:25:43] you can't seem to break out of it
[1:25:47] and this illegal is in this shell and
[1:25:49] it's
[1:25:50] it's dark in there but he begins to peck
[1:25:52] at that he didn't just peck one time
[1:25:55] too many times we say well by his traps
[1:25:57] i'm healed and then we wait and nothing
[1:25:59] happens
[1:26:00] no no we we keep pecking
[1:26:03] brother bran said in the greatest battle
[1:26:05] he says we keep taking that sword and
[1:26:07] slashing that devil

[1:26:12] sword so it comes it cuts coming and
[1:26:14] going

[1:26:17] we're just cutting this way and cutting
[1:26:19] that way and cutting this way amen
[1:26:22] because we're we're fighting the battle
[1:26:25] by his stripes i am healed
[1:26:27] amen i can do all things through christ
[1:26:29] who strengthens me
[1:26:31] and here is the little eagle that is

[1:27:29] his subconscious

[1:27:38] atmosphere around me with the word

[1:27:46] to infiltrate me amen guarding my mind
[1:27:50] continually all the time
[1:27:52] labor
[1:27:54] you know it's not given to us on a
[1:27:56] silver platter
[1:27:57] god wants us to fight for every inch
[1:28:00] but you know we're gonna get it just
[1:28:02] like the israelites got that land they
[1:28:04] went in there and they fought and they
[1:28:06] took the land

[1:30:06] little that shell and and

[1:30:11] continues to peck and peck and peck at
[1:30:13] that hole

[1:30:44] that egg begins to crack
[1:30:47] and everything satan is thrown in your
[1:30:48] path against it just fall away
[1:30:51] in second peter 1 19 21
[1:30:54] the bible says we have also a more sure
[1:30:58] word of prophecy
[1:31:00] the word of god where until you do well
[1:31:03] that you take heed as unto what a light

[1:31:18] even as he said
[1:31:20] amen
[1:31:28] in hebrews 3 1 and closing tonight
[1:31:32] paul writes wherefore
[1:31:33] holy brethren
[1:31:35] partakers of the heavenly calling
[1:31:38] consider the apostle and high priest
[1:31:40] of our profession
[1:31:42] christ jesus
[1:31:45] he is a high priest
[1:31:47] of our confession
[1:31:49] we want the high priest the bible says
[1:31:51] he can be touched
[1:31:53] by the feeling of our infirmities
[1:31:56] amen it can be touched by the feeling of
[1:31:59] our hurts
[1:32:01] our broken hearts

[1:32:07] our wounded spirits
[1:32:09] he can be touched
[1:32:11] and he is a high priest
[1:32:13] of our confession
[1:32:15] we must confess it
[1:32:17] we must speak it out all the time

[1:32:23] bible says hold fast
[1:32:25] to your confession
[1:32:27] hold fast what does that mean don't let
[1:32:30] go

[1:32:37] that you need in your life

[1:32:40] the holy ghost to a healing to your
[1:32:43] having your children come back to the
[1:32:45] lord it doesn't matter what it is there

[1:32:50] is impossible
[1:32:51] if you can't believe
[1:32:54] but there's seeds in there we need to
[1:32:56] deal with the lord
[1:32:58] clean out my mind lord
[1:32:59] clean out my subconscious father get all
[1:33:02] those seeds that i've planted over the
[1:33:04] years of unbelief and negativity lord
[1:33:06] and let your word
[1:33:08] reign in my mind lord
[1:33:11] amen

[1:33:24] trust and obey
[1:33:26] that's our job
[1:33:28] hey man it's not my job to figure out
[1:33:30] how god's gonna do it
[1:33:32] that's not my job
[1:33:34] my job is to believe that he will do it
[1:33:36] i'm going to trust him i'm going to obey
[1:33:39] him and i'm going to trust him i'm going
[1:33:42] to believe his word for my promise

[1:33:52] of jesus christ is the sickest body he
[1:33:54] knows of
[1:33:55] we're full of needs
[1:33:57] and there's promises for every need
[1:34:00] that we have
[1:34:02] there's a title of god for every need we
[1:34:04] have he is jehovah jireh
[1:34:07] he provides for us he's jehovah's shema

[1:34:22] glory to god he is the alpha and the
[1:34:25] omega the beginning of the end
[1:34:27] glory to god
[1:34:29] [Music]
[1:34:30] paul wrote
[1:34:31] i believe it's in romans he said
[1:34:34] in closing i promise

[1:35:19] guard that
[1:35:21] that city that soul
[1:35:24] the gateway
[1:35:26] remember
[1:35:27] satan wants to get in
[1:35:29] through the music of the world
[1:35:32] maybe if i ever have another chance i'll
[1:35:34] preach and bring a little teaching on
[1:35:36] the music
[1:35:37] that i have
[1:35:40] he tries to come in through that
[1:35:42] our
[1:35:44] everywhere we look
[1:35:47] satan has avenues to get into our home
[1:35:49] the internet
[1:35:51] and all the filth is out there right now
[1:35:54] god help our young people
[1:35:56] they're going through battles
[1:36:00] ten times

[1:36:30] confessions and believe god
[1:36:33] i believe god
[1:36:35] and guard your home
[1:36:38] i read a book one time a man that
[1:36:41] likened
[1:36:42] life in this earth
[1:36:45] of the christians the families and such
[1:36:48] like it was back in vietnam during the
[1:36:50] war
[1:36:52] they had when they went into the into
[1:36:54] the jungles
[1:36:56] they had what they called the point man
[1:36:58] and the point man carried a shotgun
[1:37:01] and he had to be watching
[1:37:02] for any trip wires that would set off a
[1:37:05] grenade or or a bamboo stick that would
[1:37:07] come around with tension and just impale
[1:37:10] you or things that were on the ground
[1:37:12] your foot would fall through and you'd
[1:37:13] fall into these stakes
[1:37:15] that were full of venom
[1:37:17] and impale your feet he had to be
[1:37:19] watching all that plus ambushes of the
[1:37:21] enemy
[1:37:23] and that's what the the leader in the
[1:37:25] home
[1:37:26] and also the leader of the church the
[1:37:29] leaders
[1:37:30] watching out for those that are falling
[1:37:32] behind following behind them
[1:37:34] looking for every trap that satan sets
[1:37:37] out there we're living it's like a
[1:37:39] jungle and the enemy is everywhere
[1:37:42] we're going through this place but let
[1:37:43] me tell you we're not in fear
[1:37:46] for we're trusting hallelujah
[1:37:48] that he's going to bring us through he
[1:37:50] that began to work in you shall perform
[1:37:52] it until the day of jesus christ can you
[1:37:55] say amen to that this if you stand with
[1:37:57] me amen oh i believe

[1:39:27] even as he says
[1:39:32] look up and say
[1:39:35] i believe i believe
[1:39:40] that scripture that brother robert was
[1:39:42] referring to brother jeremy is
[1:39:43] philippians 4 8.
[1:39:47] you look at your field and you see weeds
[1:39:49] growing in there and yeah
[1:39:52] and any seed will grow
[1:39:55] out of the same rain
[1:39:57] there's not a specific rain for a good
[1:39:59] crop in a
[1:40:00] rainfall it will grow because it is a
[1:40:03] seed
[1:40:04] but you go and you root out those things
[1:40:07] that you don't want
[1:40:09] you know
[1:40:10] in in the
[1:40:11] there right now in in marana we have the
[1:40:14] cotton fields
[1:40:15] and they're going through right now
[1:40:16] because of all the rain we had
[1:40:18] everything else has grown up around it
[1:40:20] and they're running around they're
[1:40:21] taking the tractors and they're plowing
[1:40:23] down all along the edges and knocking
[1:40:25] all that down
[1:40:26] because they don't want that they want
[1:40:28] the car
[1:40:30] but philippians 4 8
[1:40:34] finally brethren whatsoever things are
[1:40:36] true
[1:40:37] whatsoever things are honest
[1:40:39] whatsoever things are just
[1:40:41] whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[1:40:43] things are lovely whatsoever things are
[1:40:45] of a good report
[1:40:47] if there be any virtue
[1:40:48] and if there be any praise think on
[1:40:51] these things
[1:40:53] amen when you take that
[1:40:54] and all of us know we can testify boy i
[1:40:57] got caught up in this and next thing i
[1:40:59] know that little mo hill became a
[1:41:00] mountain
[1:41:02] and you get there later on you look and
[1:41:04] he goes that little thing gave me that
[1:41:06] much trouble
[1:41:08] it was a little thing we just let it
[1:41:10] grow
[1:41:12] but paul tells us and why would paul
[1:41:14] tell us that because he had to go
[1:41:16] through it himself each one of us this
[1:41:19] are the things that you help
[1:41:21] i believe brother branham if you read
[1:41:23] through his message and say this is how
[1:41:25] i overcame he would he would share
[1:41:27] personally
[1:41:29] this is how
[1:41:30] think on these things amen appreciate
[1:41:33] the word of god
[1:41:35] it's good when somebody comes by who

[1:41:40] not here all the time i mean
[1:41:42] he does know us brother robert's part of
[1:41:44] us but i'm just saying he's not here all
[1:41:46] the time but god gives some something to
[1:41:48] come down and our way and said hey

[1:41:53] things
[1:41:54] i
