brother Daniel's going to come sing a song for [Music] us God bless you guys hope you guys are having a good Sunday I just wanted to give some background for the song I'm about to sing It's called fishes and Loaves and the first time I heard it it really just blessed me because it's the um it's this it's based on the perspective of the little boy whenever Jesus fed the 5000 it's based on his perspective you know like giving like having the faith to give Jesus is maybe it was his last portion we don't really know much about this boy but it's really cool how this song kind of goes and you know talks about his mom talks about this might be his last um morsel left and so it just really blessed me and you know think about the words when I'm singing it but God bless you [Music] guys boy he could preach a man spoke of things Heaven still on the earth he stood on that Hill from morning until you could see the hunger in our eyes I turn to my mama and asked what should we do cuz all I had were a few more souls left but something told me that my mama believed you could this preacher could use it more than me and oh I'm trying to let go my heart isn't need I give you control I know it's not much but I know what I owe so I'll give you all of my fishes and [Music] LS I saw his disciples and they were there to witness the water turned to wine they seen with their eyes the lame man arise so I walked up to them and I said who I'm trying to let go my heart isn't easy but I give you control I know it's not much but I know what I ow I'll give you all of my fishes and [Music] Loaves they brought me to the man put a fe in his hands it held back my question in thoughts something told me that this preacher could [Music] see the war between my head and heart and he said oh my child you let go I know you're uneasy but I give you control I don't need that much for me to [Music] show I'll make the most of your fishes and L and oh I'm TR you let go I know you're uneasy but I give you control I know it's not much for me to show I'll give you all of your fishes and [Music] LS [Music] God he'll take whatever we give him and he can turn anything into something great praise God as uh Pastor comes let's sing this song I'm giving my life away I've seen a vision harsh and sweet of one who gave all he had for me I've seen the pass of his death and the Forgiveness of his final bre and

Lord God is so good well I'll have you standing let's open our Bibles and turn to John chapter [Music] 6 I asked Daniel I said buddy I want to preach on the fishes and the Loaves and um I know it's short notice but I need you to learn this song and sing it I appreciate Daniel doing for that that for his dad and he has a he has such a good voice and um I uh I just really appreciated it if you continue to play well I'll read the scriptures John chapter 6 verse1 says this and after these things Jesus Went Over the Sea of Galilee which is the Sea of t IUS when Jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company come unto him he saith unto Phillip whence shall we buy bread that these may eat and he this he said to prove him for he himself knew what he would do Philip answered him 200 penny worth of bread is not sufficient for them that every one of them may take a little and of his disciples Andrew Simon Peter's brother saith unto him there's a lad here which hath five barley Loaves and two small fishes but what are they among so many and Jesus said make the men sit down now there was much grass in the place so the men sat down in number about 5,000 and Jesus Took the Loaves and when he had given thanks he distributed to the disciples and the disciples to them that were set down and likewise of the fishes as much as they would let's bow our heads Heavenly Father reading that story knowing Lord that that story is true and these things really happened father we pray that the same spirit that was on the hill that day on that grassy Hill when the Son of God multiplied the fishes and the loaves would be here with us today and Father may we have a better understanding of your word when we leave in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you you can take your seats thank you today I was talking with um Joe yesterday when we had lunch and we were talking about I mentioned to him and I was talking about some people and I kept calling him brother Joe and I said I said Joe the reason I call you brothers that's what they did in the Bible and what they were when when you come into fellowship with each other and we call each other brothers and sisters we are as close or we should be as close as family that love should be so strong between us we just say brother and sister maybe haphazardly as a title but we should really mean it how important are the people that that surround us and and how much love love that we should have for each other Jesus said when he was giving one of his final sermons he was talking to his disciples he said that the world would know that I'm the Messiah because of the love that you show for one another imagine how important it is to show that love so that when people come in and they visit they see that these people really love each other and we want to be part of that love that they have Daniel was Daniel and I were talking the other day and and he was praying for a friend that he has that's going through a hard time and he told me he said dad he said he says in the Bible it says that that we should pray and we should fast for one another and he says why aren't we doing that for for this brother that he was talking about he says he says why why am I not doing that why are we not going before the Lord and fasting and doing everything that we can so that the Lord will come in and answer our prayers we owe it to each other and I said Daniel that's exactly scriptural it says in our Bibles in Romans chapter 15 it says those of us that are strong should bear the infirmities of those that are weak and we shouldn't please ourselves so we should carry each other's burdens and yet most of the time we point out each other's faults it never does any good do you know friends as we're as we're seeing people in church and and maybe judging them do we know that person's inner thoughts Like Jesus Does do we know that person's inner struggles do we know that person's prayers do we know they suffering do we know the weight of guilt maybe that they're carrying do we know their illnesses cancer diabetes or or depression or even Suicidal Thoughts maybe do we know that and yet we take our relationships so haphazardly how about condemnation what if that person thinks that they can't be forgiven and how much would a a loving hand reaching out to that person how much would it mean to that person to say no brother sister you're not lost the just the desire in your heart to want to get right shows that you haven't gone too far or friends do I really care what they're going through and I look at look out on the audience right now and I see I see a lot of people who need something I see a lot of people who need a touch from the Lord but one thing that I see from every single person here is I see that every one of us has something to give to hear that song that Daniel that Daniel sang about the fishes and Loaves we all have something that we can offer up and it's not an offering to the Lord how do we serve God we serve his people so when we're serving each other that comes up that offering before the Lord and it is an offer offering to him and I think do we really care do we really care about each other after Jesus ascended and and Herod killed James John's brother ran him through with a sword Herod saw that it pleased the Jews so he put Peter in prison Acts chapter five Acts chapter 12 there's Peter in prison and the Bible says that prayer was made without ceasing for Peter amen can you imagine if we would do that as a congregation if somebody here needed prayer and there was always someone praying 24 hours a day seven days a week there was all always someone on their knees praying for this person and we wonder why things don't happen we wonder why that we don't see the Miracles that we saw in the book of Acts are we doing this all the time 24 hours a day someone is calling out this person's name amen prayer without ceasing and and Friends whatever it was whatever it took these people in the book of Acts they did it we want to see the gifts operating we want to see Miracles we want to see tongues we want to see all of these things that they saw in there but we're not willing for our own lives we're not willing to get on our knees and cry out to the Lord for our Brethren so why do we want the gifts is it just for us or is it for the people is it to glorify God through the people and to help each other and we see that I I was I was witnessing to someone the other day and he knew nothing about the Lord he had never he he when he grew up he didn't that he never went to church he never really considered God and and here I am talking with him and he's struggling with addiction and he wants the addiction more than he wants God and I can see that that's so often when when we want to give to the poor we can't give to them because they want to get strung out they want the drugs more than they want God and when you see when you read the Bible and when they gave to the poor these people needed it they were they were starving to death they they wanted to be healed they wanted to be delivered so that they could get up and work and the people today they don't want it but some do there are some and as I was talking to this man I was thinking so do you know the story of Christ he said well I've heard about Jesus people tell me tell me about him and and I said but do you really know what he stood for so we went through the when someone commits a crime that you always someone El always have to pay has to pay and I told him I said if you steal from me and you get away with it I have to pay it's going to cost me money and with sin that's how sin is when when you sin when you do something wrong someone has to pay and that man just happens to be Jesus Christ so we were talking about that and the thought came to my heart no one has probably ever prayed for this man no one has ever gone to the Lord on his behalf and it struck me I thought Lord he's never he's never had a mother praying for him he's never had a father praying for him a brother or a sister or someone on the street no one probably has ever prayed for this man and now here I am and what's my role brother Kurt it's not to bow down bow my head and say Lord help this man I pray pray and and give him Deliverance in Jesus name that's not a prayer amen that's just saying a few words maybe to make yourself feel better amen but what needs to be is I need to go to prayer Earnest prayer for this man in the privacy of my own home or where I am and cry out to the Lord for him say Lord have mercy and then that scripture the effectual effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much that's when we can count on things happening is when we bring that to the Lord but instead we have so many distractions we have so many things to do we have social media and we have the internet and we have YouTube and we have entertainment and television and all these things and what these things do now in this day that's never been before by the way it takes our time away from something else you're going to be doing something all the the time so if you're on the little square Idol and watching it and and looking it remember when you're looking at it it's taking time from something else not saying you're looking at anything wrong or whatever but that time could be spent doing something else and it could be spent fellowshipping friends could be spent studying the word it could be spent praying it's it could be spent doing something that's actually productive but nowadays the enemy has come in in his sness and pulled the gift of the people out of the church and replaced it with entertainment replaced it with a phone replaced it with a computer replaced it with a television replaced it with whatever he's replaced it with and we've Let each other down when I waste my time I'm man I'm letting you down because I could be going to the Lord on your behalf I could be reaching out could be just fellowshipping just talking we draw strength from each other but the enemy takes away our gift and then we should be bringing that gift in and helping others and and serving others and time that time spent away from God it hurts not only yourself we're all always thinking about ourselves it not only hurts you but it hurts other people too mothers it hurts your children yes it does fathers it hurts your wife it hurts your children yes it does to waste that time that you could be spending doing something productive bringing your gift to your family and a gift brothers and sisters a gift always costs you something today's my daughter's birthday and Stephanie and I we we send her a gift and um it costs us something to do that come out of the bank account sent it to her I can't just give a gift without me paying something it takes something from me there's a story fairy tale but it's it's a very good lesson about these Travelers that came to this Village and they in their wagon they come to this Village and they see the villagers maybe it's a church they come in and nobody greets them they're hungry they've been on the road for a long time nobody says hello they they they try to reach out and and they they get met with with a cold formal religion and the uh leader of the group he says well he says we'll take care of this so he gets his wagon and he has he has a big pot he drives his wagon down to the creek they fill up the pot with water they put it back in the wagon they uh they take one big Stone from the side of the creek they bring it up and they bring it up right into the middle of the village and they build a fire under this pot and they they um they take this Stone and they place it in the water and they start boiling the water villagers come by said what are you what are you doing and the man he's stirring his water and he says I'm making Stone Soup he says I want everybody to Fellowship I want everybody to come in I want everybody to have a little bit of this meal he says but you know I just need I need a few vegetables man says I got a garden at home he says I got some carrots and I got some potatoes I'll be right right back so he goes and he gets the carrots and the potatoes he gives them to the man he chops them up he puts them in the in the pot and then he keeps stirring somebody else comes and says says hey I I need uh says hey what are you what are you doing here he says I'm making Stone Soup the best you ever had I'm going to share it with everybody but you know I just need a little bit I need a little bit of salt I have some salt at home let me go get it goes back gets the salt gives it to the man he dumps it in there starts smelling better butcher comes by what are you what are you doing he says I'm making stone soup it's just he said it's I want everybody to partake in it he says I'm just I'm gonna give this and he says but you know I just need some meat to put in there butcher says I've got some scraps he says I've got some cuting from from I just butchered a a a cow he says I've got some cuting let me go get them so he goes and gets them and he puts them in there keep stirring one after one the villagers come in and they say they say here here's this here's that here's potatoes here's celery here's everything the pot starts smelling good and the Roma starts going around the town and everybody starts looking forward to having this meal and he's in there and he's still stirring and maybe some come and say uh what are you making he says Stone Soup um but and we're all putting in and maybe the person says well I don't have anything I don't have we don't have any food at home we're hungry um I don't have anything to offer and the man stirring the pot stands back and he looks up underneath he says my fire is getting low he says can you go out into the woods and can you get some sticks to put under this and and keep the fire going he says I can do that I can do that so he goes out this family this poor family goes out and they they bring in the sticks and they keep the fire going and the pot cooking and then they all partake of the Stone Soup they take the stone out out throw it away not edible it didn't matter but everyone gave everyone participated in this and everyone the whole church was blessed but instead so many times we're not willing to give whatever you have whatever you have got to contribute to this to this work do it and then God will multiply it as as the man with the stone soup beautiful type of how God can use a church to feed the whole church but we all have to make a sacrifice as I said gifts don't come without a sacrifice we do hear a lot of times from the pulpit these Prosperity Gospel preachers and they get up there and they say if you give $1,000 then I promise you then he will God will multiply quiet by 10 praise God praise the Lord it goes that past past the thing and put your rings in there and your watches and everything and you watch how God will just pour it out that's false let me tell you if you give it's a sacrifice you give to let it go you give to contribute and you don't want it back but you will receive it back you'll receive a blessing from doing it but you you don't just give you don't make a deal with God say if I give $1,000 to this Lord you'll give me a better job that's not how God works Simon the Sorcerer one time he came to the to the disciples and he saw how these disciples how they could lay their hands on someone and then the holy spirit of God would enter that person that person would speak in tongues and that person would do Miracles and he saw this and he said wow I could use something like that in my Ministry I could use something like that so why don't I hey Peter come here here's the deal I want to do what you're doing because see I got this i got this ministry and uh it would really help me out it really give me a more standing with the people if I had that gift here's here's a thousand bucks you give that gift to me to where I can lay my hands on people and they will receive the Holy Spirit Peter said let me read what Peter said I'll quote him Peter said to him acts 8:20 Peter said unto him thy money perish with thee because thou has thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money thou has neither part nor lot in this matter for thine heart is not right in the sight of God repent therefore of this wickedness and pray God if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee he says Simon you need to pray to be forgiven for even the thought of doing that for I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity then answered Simon and said pray ye to the Lord for me that none of these things which you have spoken come unto me so we don't give to receive we give because we have the spirit of Christ in us and we give out so That Others May Prosper there's a story the Bible about a young lady she knew of this man Jesus Christ she had heard him preach and she knew that he was sent to the lost and she saw how his ministry blessed the people and she saw this love come come from him and she was just overwhelmed at his goodness and she thought if I could just do something for him if I could just give him a gift she was a prostitute she took her money that she had made and she went to the store and she bought a very expensive we call it the alabaster box of oil and she wanted so bad to give this gift to Jesus so Jesus was on the road all day and it's hot back then he he he comes into the house and back then that they would come in and they'd be they would wash their feet wash maybe their face and get cleaned up and then have dinner and he was at this Pharisees house he comes in Pharisee didn't think much of Jesus he wanted to embarrass him maybe Jesus comes in and doesn't wash his feet doesn't get to wash his face and anoint his hair with the oil he goes in and he sits down this lady she somehow sees inside the house The Prostitute as one that no one would ever want to be around no no one would ever give her any respect but she had a burden to do something she wanted to serve him whatever she could do so she sees him there in the house and and she sees how he's still dirty and she sees all the other people are clean why could why why did you do that don't you know what he's done she comes into the house and takes her very expensive it was probably $1,000 or more in today's money takes this alabaster box of oil goes to Jesus and anoints his head his hair with oil and she falls down at his feet and she just starts weeping because she knows that salvation is there standing sitting there in front of her in the chair and the Pharisees are looking down and they see this woman this nasty woman that that they knew where she'd been even the disciples look down must have been Judas looked down and said that's expensive stuff why didn't she just take that money sell that box take that money and we could feed the poor he didn't care he was looking down on this woman in fact right after this story is when Judas left to betray Jesus and must have clicked in his mind that must have just been just put him over the edge about this man Jesus so there she is she takes this oil she's down there and she's washing his feet not with water that was provided but she's crying and her tears are coming down and and washing his feet and her hair she she didn't have a towel so she takes her hair and she cleans his feet and dries it off she had something to give and she gave everything and we see how many people around in that day nothing they wouldn't give anything they weren't willing to to at all serve this man Jesus but she knew that life was in this man and watch her reward Matthew chapter 26 says this verse 12 for in that she hath Jesus talking he says that he when when Judas or whoever it was said that that you should have just sold this and give it to the poor Jesus said the poor you will always have with you but look what she did for in that she hath poured this ointment on my body she did it for my burial within a few days within a few days Jesus was going to be on the cross within just a few days he was going to be on the cross dying and then dead and laying in a tomb they anointed the bodies with oils back then so they wouldn't smell bad and and that they could that was the embalming way that they did it and he said he said for in that sheath poured this ointment on my body she did it for my burial verily I say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world there shall also this that this woman what this woman has done shall be told for a memorial of herj am how would you like to go down in history being someone like that God she gave everything that she had she was living a life that obviously was bad and and she knew it she was stuck in her sin she didn't know how to get out but she saw that that man there's something about him that I can get out of it and recorded in the Book of John and how many people have read that over the past 2,000 years and again I fulfill that scripture i f fulfill that prophecy this morning and telling that story how much does god require of us I think his brother Josiah said just now whatever you'll give him so I asked Daniel to sing that song about that boy that came to Jesus on those days and what had happened was Jesus was sad he was sad because his cousin his friend the Forerunner of the ministry of Jesus Christ this man named John the Baptist had just been murdered his head cut off his body desecrated his head cut off and set on a platter and brought into the court and made fun of him the greatest Prophet that had ever walked the Earth and there they were making fun of the man with his head on this platter Jesus must have really hurt him so he went up tried to get away from the people he had just been doing all these Miracles and and preaching the gospel and he wanted to get away maybe in more walked up to this hill as I as I read earlier it's a grassy area I've been to the place that they say that it happened and it's a it's a place it is it's a grassy area that you can sit up on the hill and then you can look look over the Sea of Galilee and there he was and and he's walking away way and there's no towns near there there's no place really he wanted to just get private but the people had seen all of these Miracles that he was doing they had seen the the the deaf hear and the blind see and they wanted more and Jesus was walking away and here come all of the people and Jesus goes to Philip and he says Phillip and he knew the answer Jesus already knew what he was going going to do he said Phillip he says Where can we get food for these people Philip's like he says it would cost thousands of dollars just to give them just a little morsel of food there's no way we can do them and the disciples are like hey just send them away because they're tired send them away Jesus and but there was a boy there was a young man and that young man had a had compassion he wanted to do something yes he did he must have known he must have seen just maybe a few days earlier a man that was blind that was out of his mind that couldn't talk that couldn't hear he must have seen that man come back into his his normal mind and start seeing and start start conversing and and come back he must have seen the man with the withered hand he must have seen the strength come back in his hand he must have seen the man at the pool of Bethesda or at least his parents T told him about it the man at the pool of Bethesda that was always so sick when the waters would churn and he couldn't get up and move fast enough to get in the water and yet Jesus came to him and healed him this boy knew about all of that because that's why all these people were coming so he comes and he sees and he maybe he heard Jesus say how are we going to feed all of these people am so he comes to Andrew and he says says sir he says I have two fish and Five Loaves you know what a loaf was was like a cracker it's not a loaf like we think it's just a little piece of bread and he had this and and this was this was his lunch and let me ask you something there was there was thousands upon thousands of people there do you think he was the only one that had food no there there's no way but he was the only one that was willing to give what he had how many people in that crowd had their lunches how many people were not willing to share but this little boy sees I've got to do something and in his innocence he comes to Andrew and he says here take my lunch this is all that I have can you imagine it's all that he had and he was willing to give it Andrew takes this ridiculous little lunch the Bible even says they were little fish they're probably like sardines dried sardines Andrew takes it to Jesus and he says well somebody his kid gave us his lunch and he even said he's like but what good is it with all of this what good is this little bit of food that this young man gave it doesn't mean anything but Jesus knew what was going to happen but he wanted that gift someone had to give you think your gift isn't isn't enough you think you don't have something to give everyone here everyone in this room without exception has more than that little boy had and yet he took it and if you give it to Jesus you Watch What Happens notice when he gave it to Andrew nothing happen happen it had to go to Jesus so he gives it he gives it to the Lord Jesus Takes it and somehow some way he starts breaking this and all of a sudden there's all of this food and this food is he tells his disciples he's like come over here set them down in groups of 50 maybe 50 here 50 here 50 here thousands upon thousands of people and he sets them down he prays over it they take the food and it's just one fish after the next and one piece of bread after the next and they start giving it to the people feeding them in another testimony Jesus looked out on the people he did it again by the way he looked out on the people and he had compassion on them he was sad because they were hungry and that's us do we have the same Spirit of Christ where everything that that is going going wrong that we see and we have compassion and we're willing to give whatever we have and one thing that we all have that we don't give is our time we won't get on our knees and cry out for someone we won't fast for that person we won't give what we have we'll just bow our heads and say Lord help this person now I did it check that box didn't hear that prayer that wasn't sincere maybe it was just so you could say prayed for him do you really the Bible says go into the closet and pray in secret and then God will reward you openly he's not talking about exalting you no he's talking about answering your prayers if you really have a burden for someone you go into that PR prayer closet and you're asking the Lord Lord Lord help this person I'll do whatever it takes and you stay there and you pray and you pray and you pray then all of a sudden he gets healed all of a sudden they change their lives around all of a sudden the drugs they don't want the drugs anymore all of a sudden the kids start coming back into the family and what was it because you prayed and God requires that so here's Jesus and they're passing all of this food out and here's that boy I would have loved to seen that kid I'd have loved to stand next to him say come here buddy stand here look that was your lunch you did that amen and he'll do it the Bible says in the book of Hebrews chapter 13:8 it says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that same Jesus Christ that multiplied those fishes and the loaves is the same Jesus Christ here that if we will just bring what we have to him and give it to him then he will multiply it and things will change how can we call ourselves Christians if we're not doing that a Christian is the greatest thing if you if you want to pay me a compliment call me a Christian because it's the greatest thing that I think that you could ever call me because my roots go back to the ones that this Bible was written about and I can set my name with those people on being a Christian so he fed all of these thousands of people and here's the boy like whoa yes that's my lunch so he's he's he's standing there maybe and and all of the people are eating and the miracle was seen by all of these people now look what happened John chapter 6 verse 12 when they were filled he said unto his disciples gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost therefore they gathered them together and filled 12 baskets loads with the fragments of the five barley loads which remained over and above them that had eaten and then those men this is the most by the way everybody everybody's attention this is the most important part of the whole story right here because those people got hungry again those people they eventually they got sick and they died even after all of the Miracles every everything that this was was an amazing experience but it was just a meal but watch the purpose behind the meal right then those men talking about all of these thousands of people when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did said this is of a truth that Prophet that should come into the world this is of a truth that that that Prophet should come into the world that Prophet is the Messiah so here they are they had done all the Miracles and and seen everything that they they they had seen and they're like okay well he's a prophet he's a great man maybe he's Elijah maybe he's re John the Baptist reincarnated maybe he's some great man and then they say whoa this is that Prophet this is that Messiah from this boy giving something that none of us would think was important giving his lunch helping out you think but my little gift what could it do well all I have brother Daniel all I have is I don't have any money to give I don't I don't have anything else do you have time do you have a closet that you can go into and pray let me tell you God will honor that more than all the millions of dollars that you could give it would be that prayer time crying out to the Lord with a sincere heart that is what God honors is a sincere heart like that little boy and in closing the musicians can can come think about the one that really didn't have anything to give this man Jesus Christ he had a he had a garment that was an expensive garment that someone probably had given him and it was a garment that was that was woven without a seam was nice he probably was proud of this garment that he had poor living living with what he did and coming to the Cross everything had been taken from him and even right at the end this garment that he had was even taken that was taken from him taken down there and and here's these Ro these these evil disgusting Roman soldiers drinking and and gambling and gambling over this garment that the Lord Jesus had was taken from [Music] him he goes up to the cross the Bible says that all he had to do was Dash his foot against a stone just stump his toe and the angels would come and help he said if he would if he would just cast himself off of a cliff the Angels would grab him and bear him up this is a man that had all power over everything the very power of the Father God himself was in this man Jesus Christ and what gift did he have he didn't have money he didn't even have a lunch he didn't have any clothes to get they nailed him to the cross up there naked even his dignity was gone and here he is and for me and I hope for you too he gave his gift he gave his [Music] life because remember someone has to pay and he did and there's Jesus Christ up there said father forgive them they don't know they don't know what they're doing and he says father into thy hands I commit my spirit not the man that put me on the cross not the Roman soldiers not the FES and Sadducees none of them he said Here I Am Lord I give you my life because he could have taken it back and there he was he gives it on the cross and now we can all eat of this Stone Soup we can we can all eat of the glory of God we can all eat of all of his blessings because he gave [Music] it you think that maybe that your gift doesn't mean anything First Corinthians I'll close with this 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse 57 and 58 I was down many times over the years and tell my wife I I just don't I don't think that anything that I'm doing matters and just the sadness of just somebody that that's really just broken and and and feels that he's worthless and and can't make a difference in anything and there was me there was that man and my blessed wife reads this scripture to me but but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved Brethren be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord if you have something to give give it give your time give your life give your testimony give it because if it's given with a sincere heart if it's given if it's truly given then God will take it and he will multiply it like he multiplied the fish like he multiplied the loaves he will take your efforts if they're sincere and he will bless it like you will never imagine but he requires he required that boy to have a to have a burden and to give his lunch Andrew and Andrew took it and gave it to the Lord now one of the most known stories ever it's one of the greatest stories that's ever been told is that story of the fish in the loaves brother Josiah if you could sing Daniel giving my life away um that's fine do you want that's fine before I knew brother Daniel was going to preach what he preached the Lord laid this on my heart and it says the very least I can offer is my all let's sing this together first [Music] verse and I've seen a vision harsh and sweet of one who gave all he had for me I've seen the passion of his death and the Forgiveness of his final and now I can ever be the same for my heart has been forever change I've got to live and love and give the way he [Music] gave and now I'm giving my life for [Music] way laying it down on the altar now I'm giving my life away the very least I can offer is [Music] my so here I stand [Music] today giving my life away no earthly price and no earthly price could be too great and no sacrifice too much to make no way of measuring the crost next to the blood of calary and so if I live I live for him or if I die I count it gain my life is not my own but his from this day on and now I'm giving my life away laying it down on the altar now I'm giving my life away the very least I can offer is my y so here I stand today giving my life away brothers and sisters can you imagine we study this Bible and it's it's wonderful it has just beautiful stories in it can you imagine if it wasn't just any more us reading it but it really became real to us that we really decided Lord I am going to give my life to you I'm going to do it I'm not going to continue on being just this lukewarm Christian I'm going to do what it says I am going to be that man that has that effectual fervent prayer I'm going to be that person that gives my my little bit of lunch to the Lord I remember when uh Stephanie and I were just married before we were married a friend of mine Royce Hyde and I we wanted to do something for the Lord so what we decided is we're going to skip a meal once a week and uh I was married and it was um we figured 35 bucks was what we're going to take and we're going to take that money we're going to fast that that meal we're going to take that money that we would have spent eating and we were going to put it into the service of the Lord somehow and we did that and I think that they're still doing it today and this is like 20 years later more than 20 years later where they they take a little bit of money every month and they put it into the work of the Lord somehow imagine if we would do that not only with monetary things but imagine if we would really do it with our whole lives if we would do it with our prayers with our time with our words imagine the change the difference that we can make I think that what this boy did that day on that Hill would pale in comparison to what we could do as a body of Believers think about they're getting the food ready outside and this called the pot luck everybody brings stuff everybody there there's they've brought soup they've brought desserts they've bought bread they've brought drinks imagine if we had all of the soup and we didn't have any [Music] bows it'd be gross imagine if we had all of the bread and all the desserts but we didn't have plates to put it on imagine if we didn't have drinks everything is working together but we all have a different gift to bring so bring your gift Brothers sisters bring your gift bring your gift to Jesus remember if you brought it to Andrew Andrew still had it to bring to Jesus so just skip Andrew go right to Jesus and then let him multiply the fishes and the loaves God bless you brothers and sisters brother James can you come up and close in prayer my friend brother James is Sister Barbara's son he's a he's a friend of of mine and um you know my familyes go way back I'm going to ask brother James as as you close in prayer to also pray over the [Music] food bless you I think this is the second time I've been asked to uh pray ever so it's nice seeing you all um and if we can we'll just say a quick blessing for the food de Lord we thank you for this food we ask you bless it to our body and pray that you just be with everybody this week and U let us remember you and remember us in all of our troubles we ask these things in the name of the Lord
