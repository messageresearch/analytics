[27:23] come to baptism
[27:25] it was it was a blessing to me brother
[27:28] Manny the young man that was baptized
[27:30] first
[27:31] as I said this morning he talked to me
[27:33] after service on on Sunday last week
[27:37] and he said brother he said the Lord's
[27:39] been working on my heart he said I'd
[27:40] like to be baptized and I said well it's
[27:43] funny you say that that I plan on
[27:45] speaking on the new birth and about
[27:47] baptism
[27:49] maybe the next week so let's let's plan
[27:52] on that
[27:53] and then
[27:55] um I was walking back
[27:58] here before service this morning I like
[28:01] to go back
[28:03] um to the back and shake the brother's
[28:04] hands that are that are doing the um the
[28:06] monitors and stuff
[28:08] and as I was turning the corner
[28:11] Heath
[28:12] catches me and he goes he goes hey

[28:17] um can I talk to you for a minute
[28:19] I said yeah so we stepped aside he goes

[28:43] said well we have we have stuff up there
[28:46] so then
[28:47] he uh it made me feel good and then
[28:51] as we were calling for the baptism this
[28:54] morning then it was really nice to see
[28:57] that sister
[28:59] come up there and and wanting to give
[29:03] wanting to change your life and give her
[29:05] heart to the Lord you can see
[29:07] she struggles you can you can tell that
[29:10] she's struggled in her life maybe had a
[29:11] hard life and um the drugs and living
[29:15] living in that area of society and
[29:19] wanting a change
[29:21] she told somebody after service she said
[29:25] she says now she says I want a job she
[29:28] doesn't want to fix my teeth she says I
[29:30] I just I want to change
[29:33] and I thought hey man you know his
[29:36] sister and it really encouraged me
[29:38] sister Amelia caught me after service
[29:41] and she said bro Daniel she says I
[29:43] wanted to tell you a testimony she says
[29:45] about about the sister that was baptized
[29:47] this morning she said
[29:49] she asked me
[29:51] she said I'd like to talk to the pastor
[29:52] about baptism and she's a brother I
[29:54] haven't had a chance to tell you yet
[29:57] so thank the lord we got to get to
[30:00] preach a sermon on it and and she
[30:02] followed that call
[30:04] friends when these people come
[30:06] we have to have patience
[30:08] they're not they may many of them maybe
[30:11] haven't come up like we've come up
[30:13] they haven't had the Privileges that
[30:15] we've had being talked though the way
[30:17] that we've taught been taught and and we
[30:21] see that maybe they might not
[30:23] act like we Act
[30:25] but have patience
[30:26] because this is a soul that God loves
[30:30] just as much as he loves you or me
[30:33] so so when these people come in remember
[30:36] that that's what we're here for
[30:39] we're here to bring them to this cross
[30:43] right here
[30:46] uh
[30:48] brother uh Kevin and I on Friday night
[30:54] we had that Gathering out at the um at
[30:57] the park
[30:58] and brother Kevin and I um we're talking
[31:01] with brother Isaac osario as a pastor of
[31:04] the church
[31:05] um down they're down by the airport
[31:07] Spanish Church
[31:09] and just he is if you haven't met
[31:10] brother Isaac he is just a precious
[31:13] precious brother
[31:14] but
[31:16] I was talking with him and I said um I
[31:19] said brother Isaac what have you been
[31:20] preaching on lately
[31:23] and he said uh brother he says we
[31:26] started preaching on the book of Acts
[31:29] he says we've got through the first two
[31:31] chapters
[31:33] I was like
[31:35] yes you know we don't want to over
[31:38] spiritualize something you know and we
[31:40] don't we don't want to say we don't have
[31:42] to give as I've I said many times we
[31:44] don't want to give God credit for
[31:46] something that he didn't do or think
[31:49] that something's a sign when it when
[31:51] it's really not but man that is
[31:53] encouraging
[31:55] really really just a little blessing
[31:58] from our Lord it may not be a miracle or
[32:01] some great thing but I believe it's God
[32:04] sending down his little love letters and
[32:08] telling us that that he loves us
[32:11] now back to the book of Acts
[32:14] I love this book I I love I love
[32:18] everything about it I just I see that we
[32:20] can place ourselves
[32:22] in this and
[32:25] first a little bit a little bit of a
[32:27] review
[32:29] um
[32:31] Acts chapter 3
[32:34] really really important miracle happened
[32:38] you remember what it was
[32:42] Am I by myself
[32:44] what happened the miracle at the gate
[32:47] called Beautiful
[32:49] right and we had
[32:51] this man that all of these people knew
[32:55] God chose him
[32:57] to have this miracle happen he'd been
[32:59] crippled since he was born
[33:01] and and the Lord Peter and John came to
[33:05] him and Peter said Silver and Gold Have
[33:07] I None but what I have I give to you
[33:09] rise up and walk and the man that had
[33:12] been crippled for his whole life over 40
[33:15] years rose up in the name of the Lord
[33:18] Jesus and the key to all of that is
[33:21] everybody sought
[33:24] and then we move on
[33:27] to Acts chapter 4
[33:29] and I talked about we have these two
[33:33] different
[33:34] um groups
[33:36] in Judaism
[33:39] we have these these two different
[33:40] priests remember who they are
[33:43] Pharisees and the Sadducees
[33:46] you remember who were with with the do
[33:49] you remember who didn't believe in the
[33:50] resurrection
[33:52] the Sadducees
[33:54] and they then we have the Pharisees and
[33:58] they were they were they were the
[34:00] Sadducees were the temple workers they
[34:02] were the priests in the temple the
[34:04] sagitt the Pharisees were spread out
[34:06] around Judea and they were like the
[34:09] local pastors and the the Pharisees were
[34:12] the ones that gave Jesus probably the
[34:14] most trouble at the beginning when he
[34:16] was there but then these these Sadducees
[34:19] they agreed with the Pharisees to
[34:21] crucify Jesus now these Sadducees now
[34:24] that Jesus was resurrected these
[34:26] Sadducees start saying hey
[34:28] we don't believe in a resurrection
[34:31] so
[34:32] you're preaching something that's false
[34:35] when you're preaching the resurrection
[34:37] and Peter and in his sermons he just
[34:39] really stuck it to him he says he says
[34:42] the one that you crucified rose from the
[34:44] dead
[34:45] and
[34:46] we see that this in Acts chapter 4 we
[34:50] see that here we have the first
[34:52] persecution that starts among this newly
[34:57] formed Christian Church here at
[34:59] Jerusalem and let's let's go back to to
[35:02] Leia Foundation let's go back to Acts
[35:04] chapter 4 verse 29 and start reading
[35:07] there
[35:09] and now this is a this is the brother's
[35:13] preaching when they when they'd come
[35:15] back from being persecuted and now Lord
[35:17] behold their threatenings and Grant unto
[35:20] thy servants that with all boldness they
[35:22] may speak Thy Word by stretching forth
[35:25] thine hand to heal and that signs and
[35:27] wonders may be done by the name of thy
[35:30] holy Child Jesus
[35:33] now
[35:35] that's how important you know we've
[35:37] talked many times we talk about miracles
[35:41] Miracles are important an important part
[35:44] of Christianity there are important part
[35:47] of our belief because one of the reasons
[35:51] right here in the book of Acts it shows
[35:54] that there is an almighty God that's
[35:56] alive and living and it's not just this
[36:00] intellectual conception that these
[36:02] Pharisees and Sadducees had this God is
[36:05] alive
[36:07] and he's this Jesus Christ came and he
[36:11] showed these things happen and now this
[36:13] Same Spirit that was in Christ is in
[36:17] their Ministry so you see when Jesus was
[36:20] here it was
[36:22] limited to this one man
[36:24] and then when the Holy Spirit fell back
[36:26] to Acts chapter 2 that same Spirit of
[36:29] Christ came down and it dwelt in human
[36:32] beings and then to put it in in modern
[36:36] terms then the ministry and healings
[36:39] went viral
[36:41] it went everywhere and it started here
[36:44] in Jerusalem
[36:46] and when they had prayed the place was
[36:49] shaken where they were assembled
[36:50] together and they were all filled with
[36:52] the Holy Ghost and they spake the word
[36:54] of God with boldness
[36:56] and the multitude of them that believed
[36:58] were of one heart and of one Soul
[37:00] neither said any of them that ought of
[37:03] the things which possessed was his own
[37:04] but they had all things in common look
[37:08] at the unity in the church and with
[37:10] great power gave the apostles witness of
[37:12] the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and
[37:15] great grace was upon them all
[37:17] neither was there any among them that
[37:19] lacked for as many as were possessors of
[37:22] lands or houses sold them and brought
[37:24] them and brought brought the prices of
[37:26] the things that were sold and laid them
[37:28] down at the apostles feet and
[37:29] distribution was made unto every man
[37:31] according as he had need and Joseph
[37:35] who by the apostles was surnamed
[37:37] Barnabas which is being in interpreted
[37:40] the son of consolation a levite and of
[37:43] the country of Cyprus now Cyprus is an
[37:46] island that's north and west of Israel
[37:50] south of Turkey
[37:52] having land sold it and brought the
[37:55] money and laid it at the apostles feet
[37:58] it's the end of chapter four now let's
[38:00] go to chapter five Acts chapter 5.
[38:03] but that's a rough way to start a
[38:08] chapter
[38:09] but
[38:11] so we know
[38:13] something
[38:15] good is not going to happen here
[38:18] a certain man named ananias
[38:21] with Sapphira his wife sold a possession
[38:26] and kept back part of the price
[38:28] his wife also being privy to it and
[38:32] brought a certain part and laid it at
[38:35] the apostles feet notice that they just
[38:38] kept back part of it
[38:40] they they didn't keep back all of it
[38:43] they didn't it was just it was just this
[38:47] this one part that they kept back and I
[38:50] talked this morning about a new birth
[38:52] and we think about if you apply that
[38:56] really quickly
[38:57] to our walk with the Lord
[39:00] you see ananias and Sapphira they were
[39:04] willing to give everything that was
[39:06] theirs in the first place they were
[39:08] willing they said that they were going
[39:10] to give everything except one little bit
[39:12] of it
[39:13] and it's like our walk with the Lord
[39:16] we can we can say Lord I'm going to
[39:19] follow you I'm going to serve you but if
[39:22] we don't completely give everything to
[39:27] him to give all of our heart to him
[39:30] then it's not enough
[39:32] Jesus requires everything
[39:36] he said
[39:38] he tells the disciples earlier he said
[39:41] take up your cross
[39:43] and follow me
[39:46] that cross Jesus gave it all
[39:49] he gave any talents that he had he gave
[39:53] any any type of
[39:55] potential that he had he gave everything
[39:58] for the gospel and those bloody
[40:02] footprints that he walked he said now
[40:05] you take up your cross and you walk in
[40:08] these same footprints
[40:12] but Peter said
[40:14] ananias why hath Satan filled thine
[40:17] heart to lie to the Holy Ghost and to
[40:20] keep back part of the price of the land
[40:22] whilst it remained was it not thy own
[40:25] and after it was sold was it not the in
[40:29] thine power own power why hast thou
[40:31] conceived this thing in thy heart thou
[40:34] Hast not lied unto men
[40:38] but unto God
[40:40] now notice this is an important part of
[40:42] this there's Cults and groups that can
[40:46] take this scripture and form these
[40:48] things that are not right
[40:50] notice that ananias is very plain here
[40:53] he was not required to give anything
[40:57] that wasn't that wasn't part of the deal
[41:00] that wasn't they weren't they weren't
[41:02] compelling people to give anything
[41:06] this man Barnabas he did it of his own
[41:09] choosing
[41:10] and you know you see like today it's
[41:14] real popular and it started with the
[41:17] televangelists way back I don't know 20
[41:19] or 30 years ago
[41:22] where they're always trying to get the
[41:24] people's money they're always trying to
[41:26] get the people to give to make an
[41:28] offering or or to to put more money in
[41:31] the in the plate and and to and to write
[41:34] a check oh if you give a check for this
[41:36] much then you'll receive 10 times that
[41:39] amount
[41:41] that's not anywhere in this Bible
[41:45] it it's not there when these brothers
[41:48] when they made a sacrifice to give to
[41:51] the church
[41:52] it was gone
[41:54] that was a sacrifice
[41:57] otherwise if you're saying well if you
[41:59] if you give this amount of money then
[42:01] you're going to win the lottery no no no
[42:03] no then you're benefiting from it and
[42:06] it's not a sacrifice anymore
[42:08] these brothers and sisters they gave
[42:11] freely
[42:13] and with this ananias and Sapphira they
[42:18] maybe saw Barnabas
[42:21] and and this man and how respected he
[42:24] was and they saw that Barnabas took this
[42:27] money and and gave it
[42:30] and then maybe they said you know what
[42:32] for our own standing
[42:35] we're gonna give this amount of money
[42:39] and it looks to me like because they
[42:42] kept back some that at the very
[42:44] beginning their motives are wrong
[42:48] they they maybe and it doesn't say this
[42:50] but it seemed like they wanted the
[42:53] respect of the church so they they gave
[42:56] this money but they made a pact between
[43:00] themselves
[43:02] that hey let's we'll sell it for this
[43:04] much we'll give the church this much
[43:08] and uh and then we just won't tell them
[43:10] they're not telling them was the mistake
[43:13] that was that was the big thing they own
[43:17] the land
[43:18] and you can see right here that they're
[43:21] under no obligation to give anything
[43:22] really
[43:24] but they own this land and they said
[43:26] we've given everything
[43:29] and it wasn't the right it wasn't the
[43:32] right statement
[43:33] and that is why this persecution that's
[43:36] why that this happened to ananias and
[43:39] Sapphira
[43:42] ananias hearing these words
[43:45] fell down and gave up the ghost
[43:49] and great fear Came Upon all them that
[43:53] heard these things
[43:54] now this is the third miracle
[43:57] that has happened that's recorded in the
[43:58] book of Acts the first one as I
[44:01] mentioned on in Acts chapter 3 was was
[44:04] at the gate called Beautiful when the
[44:06] crippled man was healed and then in Acts
[44:08] chapter 4 that they were they were
[44:11] thanking the lord for for suffering
[44:13] persecutions and there was they were
[44:15] worshiping and then the place that they
[44:17] were in this whether it be a it was a
[44:20] building it was a church or a house or
[44:22] something this place shook with the
[44:25] power of the holy spirit because they
[44:28] were in just such unity and as it seems
[44:31] like God was just so pleased
[44:33] so then we see that this third miracle
[44:37] happened
[44:39] and the young men arose and wound them
[44:40] up and carried them out and buried him
[44:43] and it was not this about the space of
[44:45] three hours after when his wife not
[44:48] knowing what was done came in and Peter
[44:50] had answered answered unto her tell me
[44:52] whether ye sold the land for so much and
[44:56] she said yeah for so much
[44:59] and Peter said unto her
[45:01] how is it that you have agreed together
[45:03] to tempt the spirit of the Lord
[45:05] behold the feet of them which have
[45:07] buried thy husband are at the door and
[45:10] shall carry thee out
[45:14] and she fell down and she died right
[45:18] there and and we see
[45:20] right here I want to I want to point
[45:24] something out
[45:26] that we as Believers and and as people
[45:32] that highly regard brother branham's
[45:35] message
[45:36] we have we have seen that he had this
[45:39] just powerful and wonderful gift of what
[45:43] we call discernment other people call it
[45:45] the the gift of knowledge but when
[45:49] people would come up to the platform he
[45:52] was able to maybe never meeting them
[45:54] before he could say your name is Lyle
[45:58] Johnson you have done this and this and
[46:01] this go and be healed in the name of the
[46:04] Lord Jesus
[46:06] and people took
[46:08] what brother Branham did
[46:10] took that gift
[46:12] and brother Branham called that gift he
[46:15] said that that was the sign of the
[46:17] Messiah
[46:18] but they have taken that gift and they
[46:20] have said that this brother Branham
[46:24] maybe is in that position
[46:27] because of this gift was so powerful but
[46:29] I want to point out right here that the
[46:32] Apostle Peter had the same gift
[46:35] and did the exact same thing to ananias
[46:38] and Sapphira
[46:41] then fell she down straightway at his
[46:44] feet and yielded up The Ghost and the
[46:46] young men came in and found her dead and
[46:49] carrying her forth buried her by her
[46:51] husband
[46:52] and great fear Came Upon all the church
[46:55] and upon as many as heard these things
[47:00] I'll bet it did
[47:02] you think about what just happened these
[47:06] people they lied a simple lie
[47:10] and they were struck down
[47:14] probably in front of other people we
[47:15] know that there was other people there
[47:17] that carried them out and you got to
[47:19] think if that would happen here in the
[47:23] Tucson Tabernacle
[47:25] and that spirit is here in the same
[47:28] spirit of God is here imagine if that
[47:31] happened here at the church
[47:35] and then imagine if you witnessed to
[47:37] someone afterwards
[47:39] be like hey you know a friend you have a
[47:42] co-worker at work you gotta come to the
[47:44] Tabernacle here's what happened these
[47:46] two people came up and they lied about
[47:48] about some money that they were said
[47:50] they were going to give and they didn't
[47:51] give all of it and then they all they
[47:53] died right there
[47:54] come to church
[47:58] it'll be great
[48:01] think about that
[48:03] but
[48:04] there was also that church was growing
[48:08] there was the power of the Holy Spirit
[48:11] there to where those people saw that
[48:14] happen and all of these Miracles were
[48:18] just starting and there was unity in the
[48:20] church and love in the church and people
[48:22] wanted they wanted to be there
[48:27] where are we at verse number 12. and by
[48:31] the hands of the apostles were many
[48:33] signs and wonders wrought among the
[48:34] people and they were all with one Accord
[48:37] in Solomon's porch and the rest there's
[48:40] no man join himself to them
[48:43] but the people magnified them and the
[48:46] Believers were the more added to the
[48:48] Lord multitudes both of men and women
[48:52] um remember let me stop right here
[48:56] and it just came to mind
[48:58] that
[49:01] um I mentioned that Luke wrote This Book
[49:04] of Acts
[49:05] and he also wrote the the um the Gospel
[49:09] of Luke
[49:10] one thing Luke does is many times and
[49:13] you see it in the verse I just read Luke
[49:15] mentions women
[49:17] while the other gospels don't really
[49:19] mention the women as much
[49:22] and in the book of Acts it often
[49:24] includes the women but you have to look
[49:27] at the author
[49:28] Luke who was who who spoke Greek
[49:33] the other the other brothers Matthew
[49:35] mark
[49:37] and John
[49:39] they were Hebrews
[49:41] they were they were writing this from a
[49:44] Hebrew perspective this Luke is writing
[49:47] this for the gentile people and the
[49:51] Gentiles while the Jews don't include
[49:53] women in genealogies and all that you'll
[49:56] see that Luke does
[49:58] because the Gentiles the Romans and the
[50:00] Greeks and all of them they didn't see
[50:02] the same as as the Jews did they revered
[50:06] women in a different way that they were
[50:10] that um not that they were more
[50:12] important but they were more part of it
[50:15] so you'll see again you'll see Luke
[50:17] again mentions women well the other
[50:20] gospels might just say men
[50:22] and and it's or the the Old Testament or
[50:27] the um some of the other Epistles might
[50:29] just say men but Luke is playing in
[50:31] saying women also
[50:35] let's see where are we at verse number
[50:38] 15.
[50:41] let me let me go back to 14. and
[50:42] believers
[50:43] were the more added
[50:48] and Believers were the more added to the
[50:50] Lord multitudes of both men and women
[50:52] and so much that they brought forth the
[50:55] sick into the streets and laid them on
[50:57] beds and couches that at the least the
[51:01] shadow of Peter passing by might
[51:04] overshadow some of them
[51:09] what a testimony to Peter
[51:13] now was Peter's Shadow anointed I don't
[51:17] I don't see that
[51:19] but Peter lives such a life
[51:23] before these people and he had such a
[51:27] spirit about him and they had such
[51:30] confidence
[51:31] in Peter that just they just wanted to
[51:34] be in his presence and they know that it
[51:37] wasn't Peter but it was the presence
[51:39] that Peter had and the Lord the holy
[51:42] spirit that was promised was upon Peter
[51:44] and if they could just come into Peter's
[51:47] presence and just his shadow they had
[51:50] the faith that they would be healed
[51:53] it's it's really it's very similar to to
[51:57] Jesus when he was walking along and that
[52:00] little lady that had the blood issue the
[52:02] bleeding and how she she just revered
[52:05] him so much she had heard so much about
[52:07] the Lord Jesus and she said if I could
[52:10] just touch that tassel that that him of
[52:15] His Garment hanging down she said if I
[52:18] could just touch that I know I will be
[52:20] healed and he comes by and she goes over
[52:23] and touches it and immediately she's
[52:26] healed
[52:27] and Jesus says he says strength has gone
[52:31] out of me
[52:32] and he says sister your faith
[52:35] your faith has made you whole
[52:38] she had faith that that if she could
[52:41] touch that garment we see in Acts
[52:43] chapter 19 that will come to later on
[52:45] that they took from the garments of Paul
[52:49] and they they took him and they said
[52:50] this is just with Paul and and laid it
[52:54] on the people and the people were healed
[52:56] just from his government Was His Garment
[52:58] anointed
[53:00] it was the spirit that Paul had and that
[53:04] faith that they have it was a point of
[53:06] Faith the same thing that we when we
[53:08] anoint with oil
[53:10] we take the oil and we anoint the people
[53:13] and it represents that of the Holy
[53:15] Spirit and it becomes a point of faith
[53:18] for us to increase that Faith that's why
[53:21] you see so many different ways of
[53:23] healing
[53:24] you see the the Gentile coming coming to
[53:27] to Lord Jesus and he says I'm not worthy
[53:29] it's you even come under my house
[53:32] and Jesus said I haven't seen such great
[53:34] faith in Israel
[53:36] and Jesus just spoke the word there in
[53:40] other places he had to come and lay his
[53:42] hands on and in other places we see
[53:44] laying a garment from from Paul or
[53:47] anointing with oil it is anything that
[53:51] helps that is gives us that point of
[53:54] faith
[53:55] and it's by the grace of God how
[53:58] wonderful that he gave us so many things
[54:01] in this word that we can receive our
[54:04] healing because he wants to heal us
[54:08] there came also a multitude out of the
[54:10] Cities round about Jerusalem bring sick
[54:13] folks
[54:14] and them which were vexed with unclean
[54:16] spirits and they were healed everyone
[54:20] that's that is beautiful every single
[54:24] one would come and be healed
[54:28] there also came a multitude I just said
[54:31] that then the high priest rose up
[54:35] and all they that were with him which is
[54:37] the sect of the Sadducees
[54:39] and were filled with indignation
[54:43] and they laid their hands on the
[54:44] apostles and put them in the common
[54:46] prison
[54:48] but the angel of the Lord by Night
[54:51] opened the prison doors and brought them
[54:54] forth and said go stand and speak in the
[54:57] temple
[54:59] to the people all the words of this life
[55:02] now the gospel is being openly
[55:05] proclaimed
[55:07] they weren't ready to go out and do this
[55:10] before Acts chapter 2. before this Holy
[55:13] Spirit said fell but now that they're
[55:17] filled with the Holy Ghost God puts them
[55:21] on display in front of the people
[55:24] brother Branham said many times he said
[55:27] that these people going out and
[55:29] preaching with signs following them is
[55:31] the gospel on display are his words
[55:36] and when they heard that they entered
[55:39] into the temple early in the morning and
[55:40] taught but the high priest came and they
[55:44] that were with him and called the
[55:46] council together and all the Senate of
[55:49] the children of Israel and sent to the
[55:51] prison to have them brought
[55:54] but when the officers came
[55:56] and found them not
[55:58] in the prison they returned and told
[56:01] saying the the prison truly found we
[56:05] shut with all safety and the keeper
[56:07] standing without before the doors but
[56:10] when we had opened we found no man
[56:13] Within
[56:15] now when the high priest and the captain
[56:17] of the temple and the chief priests
[56:19] heard these things they doubted of them
[56:22] whereunto this would grow
[56:25] think about this it's like oh great
[56:29] you know first this guy gets healed at
[56:31] the Temple Gate brother so and so Mr
[56:34] so-and-so gets healed at the Temple Gate
[56:36] then the walls of their Church shake
[56:39] with power of the Holy Ghost then those
[56:41] that couple that lied they dropped dead
[56:45] and then all of these other people are
[56:47] being healed what is going on here
[56:51] then then came one and told them behold
[56:54] the men whom you put in prison are
[56:57] standing in the temple and teaching the
[56:59] people
[57:00] I can't win for losing brother
[57:04] then went the captain with the officers
[57:07] and brought them without violence for
[57:10] they feared the people lest they should
[57:13] have been stoned
[57:16] look at this
[57:17] they uh
[57:20] they say
[57:24] they're they're gonna go They're gonna
[57:26] go take these people
[57:27] and they say hey preacher hey priest
[57:30] listen wait a minute
[57:32] these guys have preached deliverance
[57:34] from your nonsense
[57:37] these guys
[57:39] I was in that building maybe when those
[57:42] walls shook
[57:44] I knew brother so and so
[57:48] when he was at the gate called Beautiful
[57:50] there at the temple I remember him from
[57:53] years and years ago he was always
[57:56] crippled I knew his mom and his dad I
[57:59] know all of them and now you're gonna
[58:01] take these people and you're gonna throw
[58:04] them in prison are you going to beat
[58:05] them
[58:09] no you're not
[58:12] so they say well
[58:16] we'll bring them without violence would
[58:19] you mind Peter and John would you mind
[58:21] coming with us
[58:23] people are there what are you gonna do
[58:26] well would you mind coming with us so
[58:29] they go
[58:32] and when they had brought them they set
[58:34] them before the council and the high
[58:36] priest asked them
[58:38] saying did not we straightly command you
[58:41] that you should not teach in this name
[58:44] and behold you have filled Jerusalem
[58:46] with your Doctrine and intend to bring
[58:49] this man's blood upon us
[58:52] Peter and John were like oh oh sorry we
[58:55] forgot we forgot you told us that
[58:57] yeah I'm sorry we
[59:01] we
[59:03] it's a bit it's a mistake no
[59:06] Oh and about the filling Jerusalem with
[59:10] this Doctrine can you imagine
[59:13] brother Jonathan can you imagine filling
[59:17] Tucson with this Doctrine can you
[59:20] imagine feeling Lusaka with this
[59:22] doctrine that Jesus Christ is risen from
[59:26] the dead and people are getting healed
[59:29] and they say you're filling you're
[59:31] filling this whole city with this
[59:33] Doctrine
[59:35] and then they say this and this Burns me
[59:39] and intend to bring this man's blood
[59:42] upon us
[59:44] speaking of Jesus
[59:46] look who is speaking
[59:50] just a few weeks earlier
[59:53] they said let his blood be upon us and
[59:56] our children
[59:58] and now they're afraid that they're
[1:00:00] going to get some rocks thrown at them
[1:00:03] so they're saying now now you're
[1:00:05] bringing this man's blood upon us how
[1:00:08] soon they forgot what they did to the
[1:00:10] Lord Jesus
[1:00:11] what a shame
[1:00:15] oh you know
[1:00:17] these people that they were oppressing
[1:00:21] that they were that they were holding
[1:00:23] under their their rule
[1:00:26] probably scaring them to death all the
[1:00:29] time and preaching things this these
[1:00:31] fear tactics said oh if you go do this
[1:00:33] or if you go do that you're going to be
[1:00:35] you're going to be cast out or whatever
[1:00:38] and now they're afraid
[1:00:41] because they pick up a few rocks and
[1:00:43] they're going to throw them at them
[1:00:45] then Peter and the other despite this
[1:00:48] the other Apostles answered and said we
[1:00:51] ought to obey God rather than men
[1:00:55] huh
[1:00:57] I think I might have
[1:00:59] I don't know that what they said
[1:01:03] you're bringing this man's blood upon us
[1:01:06] how dare they
[1:01:09] say that
[1:01:10] when just a few weeks earlier they said
[1:01:12] let his blood be upon us
[1:01:15] the god of our fathers raised up Jesus
[1:01:17] whom you slew and hanged on a tree
[1:01:20] him hath God exalted with his right hand
[1:01:22] to be a prince and a savior for to give
[1:01:25] repentance to Israel and and forgiveness
[1:01:27] of sins look at how sweet
[1:01:30] this message is
[1:01:33] and we are his Witnesses of these things
[1:01:36] and so is also the Holy Ghost whom God
[1:01:39] hath given to them that obey him
[1:01:42] and when they when they heard that they
[1:01:45] were cut to the heart
[1:01:47] and they took counsel to slay them
[1:01:51] then stood there
[1:01:55] up one in the Council of Pharisees a
[1:01:59] fair of the a Pharisee
[1:02:01] named gamalia Gamaliel a doctor of the
[1:02:07] law
[1:02:07] had her had in reputation among them
[1:02:10] among all the people and commanded to be
[1:02:13] to put the apostles forth a little space
[1:02:17] he was like Hey chill out
[1:02:20] with these guys
[1:02:22] you know Paul this man Gamaliel
[1:02:27] he was a great great man of that time
[1:02:31] he was his his family came from the
[1:02:35] lineage he was a Pharisee his family
[1:02:37] came from the lilies of priests I
[1:02:39] believe it was his dad that was one of
[1:02:41] the greatest Pharisees in all of Israel
[1:02:45] and he was in fact
[1:02:48] the teacher of this young man named Paul
[1:02:51] named Saul back then until God changed
[1:02:54] his name
[1:02:56] and he had the authority and you can see
[1:02:59] this Authority when when he stands up
[1:03:01] and he says wait a minute
[1:03:06] with the Sadducees and everyone
[1:03:07] listening to them to him and he said
[1:03:10] unto them ye men of Israel take heed to
[1:03:13] yourselves
[1:03:14] what you intend to do as touching these
[1:03:16] men
[1:03:17] for before these days rose up through
[1:03:20] this boasting himself to be somebody
[1:03:24] to whom a number of men about 400 joined
[1:03:27] themselves who was slain and all as many
[1:03:30] as obeyed him were scattered and brought
[1:03:33] to not after this man rose up Judas of
[1:03:36] Galilee in the days of the taxing and
[1:03:39] Drew away much people after him and he
[1:03:42] also perished and all even as many
[1:03:45] obeyed him were dispersed
[1:03:48] these two men they're they're in history
[1:03:52] you can you can look up there's other
[1:03:54] writings besides the Bible about these
[1:03:57] minutes probably them
[1:03:59] and they're false leaders
[1:04:01] they may have been I didn't read it very
[1:04:04] thorough but they may have been
[1:04:06] insurrectionists they may have been cult
[1:04:08] leaders but we see that that they rose
[1:04:11] up and they they got people to follow
[1:04:14] them
[1:04:15] and and to
[1:04:18] lift them up to a place of leadership
[1:04:22] and how many times do we see that and
[1:04:25] they're they're people here right now
[1:04:29] that have experienced people raise up
[1:04:32] with a certain Doctrine or a certain
[1:04:35] vision and
[1:04:37] this this vision is is maybe some new
[1:04:42] revelation
[1:04:43] maybe some some big powerful thing
[1:04:49] that make maybe comes from it's so
[1:04:52] common The Book of Daniel
[1:04:54] or somewhere in in the Book of
[1:04:57] Revelation and they take these
[1:05:00] scriptures and they create these
[1:05:03] doctrines around it and they're so
[1:05:05] compelling in the way that that they say
[1:05:08] it brother Rome you remember
[1:05:11] uh probably 25 years ago remember the
[1:05:14] the
[1:05:16] the men that will go around with the
[1:05:19] message books that were all marked up
[1:05:21] and remember how they they just pull on
[1:05:24] us and and then they'd say look at this
[1:05:26] quote you know and then they give you
[1:05:28] this and and it was it was always some
[1:05:30] some big Fandango Revelation and then
[1:05:33] they try to get you to follow them and
[1:05:36] to follow their leader and we see that
[1:05:39] many of these people
[1:05:42] they ended really badly
[1:05:46] one of them is in a couple of them in
[1:05:48] Prescott we all know those
[1:05:51] other ones were they they went to they
[1:05:54] went to Colorado
[1:05:55] they brought this people out they
[1:05:57] started Living sinful lives following a
[1:06:00] certain man and then
[1:06:03] it just
[1:06:04] many of them fell into sin and in drugs
[1:06:07] and and all kinds of problems and it all
[1:06:11] came to not
[1:06:13] there's two of them
[1:06:15] that and mentioned their names but
[1:06:17] there's two of them right there that
[1:06:19] just that we have all seen most of us
[1:06:21] that we know about
[1:06:23] and here is this this Gamaliel
[1:06:27] and he's saying listen do you remember
[1:06:29] what happened with this person do you
[1:06:31] remember what happened was that that
[1:06:32] person don't worry about it
[1:06:35] let them go leave them alone if if if it
[1:06:40] is what you think it is it's gonna come
[1:06:42] to not it's gonna fail
[1:06:45] but if it's not
[1:06:49] listen to this
[1:06:53] and I say unto you now I say now unto
[1:06:56] you refrain from these men
[1:06:59] and let them alone for if this Council
[1:07:03] or this work be of men it will come to
[1:07:06] not
[1:07:08] but if it be of God you cannot overthrow
[1:07:11] it lest happily you be found even to
[1:07:14] fight against God what wisdom you can
[1:07:18] see while gamalia was raised up to that
[1:07:21] position that he was
[1:07:24] and to him they agreed
[1:07:27] I could I could mention some there's
[1:07:30] famous cults that have risen up calling
[1:07:33] themselves Christians over the years and
[1:07:35] probably the most famous one was Jim
[1:07:37] Jones
[1:07:38] and how he
[1:07:40] he was this charismatic man and and he
[1:07:43] brought these doctrines that resonated
[1:07:46] with some of the people but you'll
[1:07:48] notice that all of these these men these
[1:07:52] cult leaders they always they always
[1:07:55] vary from Christ
[1:07:58] and it becomes more about them or their
[1:08:01] Revelation
[1:08:02] rather than about the Lord Jesus it's
[1:08:05] just a Tell-Tale sign every single time
[1:08:09] it fails because it's not about Christ
[1:08:12] but these Brethren here in the book of
[1:08:15] Acts it was about Christ
[1:08:18] that's why it didn't fail but here is
[1:08:21] gamalia he's saying that it's gonna fail
[1:08:24] if it's false just like all these other
[1:08:28] ones have failed
[1:08:30] and to him they agreed
[1:08:33] and when they had called the apostles
[1:08:35] and beaten them
[1:08:37] they commanded that they should not
[1:08:40] speak in the name of Jesus and they let
[1:08:42] them go
[1:08:46] again
[1:08:48] stop doing that
[1:08:51] stop preaching about this Jesus it's
[1:08:53] costing us all kinds of trouble
[1:08:56] it's getting everybody stirred up so so
[1:08:58] far that did you see our priests were
[1:09:00] there and they picked up stones and
[1:09:02] we're going to throw rocks at them
[1:09:04] and these are the same priests that
[1:09:06] would would Stone
[1:09:07] someone for committing a crime
[1:09:10] and these Brethren I love it that they
[1:09:14] stuck up for the disciples these
[1:09:16] Brethren picked up Stones like don't
[1:09:17] mess with them
[1:09:20] and then we see how much
[1:09:24] hatred
[1:09:25] in these Pharisees and Sadducees for
[1:09:28] these new Christians and we see it so
[1:09:32] much today
[1:09:34] we see that you can be anything that you
[1:09:38] want in life as long as you're not a
[1:09:40] Christian
[1:09:42] if you are a Christian in in this
[1:09:44] country now
[1:09:46] you're automatically labeled a racist or
[1:09:49] you automatically labeled a homophobe or
[1:09:52] you're automatically labeled a
[1:09:55] discriminator or or you all you're
[1:09:59] automatically labeled
[1:10:01] and they're the the Christians are the
[1:10:05] the one true people that actually love
[1:10:06] people
[1:10:07] they actually want to see people come to
[1:10:10] Christ they want to see people
[1:10:11] rehabilitated but the world just hates
[1:10:14] them
[1:10:15] and you see right here in this book of
[1:10:17] Acts here is this Spirit right then they
[1:10:20] were only doing good
[1:10:23] show me where
[1:10:25] anywhere here that any of these brothers
[1:10:29] or sisters persecuted anyone
[1:10:32] you can't
[1:10:33] the book of Acts these new Christians
[1:10:35] this new church
[1:10:36] show me where that they came against
[1:10:39] anyone you see with Stephen
[1:10:42] I mean he let them have it which we're
[1:10:44] gonna we're gonna see a little bit later
[1:10:46] but they were about to Stone him
[1:10:49] Peter let him have it but they were
[1:10:52] going to kill him
[1:10:54] these Christians were good sweet loving
[1:10:59] people that wanted to see their sick
[1:11:02] healed they wanted to see the Lost saved
[1:11:07] and just because it didn't line up with
[1:11:09] these Pharisees and Sadducees they took
[1:11:12] them as their enemy
[1:11:15] and they departed from the presence of
[1:11:17] the council
[1:11:18] rejoicing
[1:11:19] that they were counted worthy to suffer
[1:11:22] shame for his name
[1:11:25] that's the same today
[1:11:28] I'll suffer shame for the name of Jesus
[1:11:30] Christ anytime I love him
[1:11:34] and daily in the temple and in every
[1:11:37] house they ceased not to teach and to
[1:11:41] preach Jesus Christ
[1:11:44] his gospel was always in their
[1:11:48] conversation
[1:11:50] they were always talking about the Lord
[1:11:53] they were always talking about the word
[1:11:55] they were they were always witnessing
[1:11:58] they were always about the father's
[1:12:01] business remember I said at the
[1:12:04] beginning and you can see it it really
[1:12:06] the musicians can come we'll close here
[1:12:08] in a few minutes
[1:12:10] um it really meant something to me
[1:12:12] brother Lyle when I read that that
[1:12:16] they were willing to give everything
[1:12:19] it struck me and I read it over and I
[1:12:22] was
[1:12:23] I was thinking Lord that they were born
[1:12:27] again Christians
[1:12:29] they were willing to do whatever it took
[1:12:33] and I was thinking it my mind kept going
[1:12:36] to Jesus carrying that cross and him
[1:12:39] giving his life
[1:12:41] and him saying take it now you take up
[1:12:44] your cross and follow me now you do the
[1:12:46] same and they did it
[1:12:49] they accomplished it
[1:12:51] and we see Miracles just going out from
[1:12:55] among them we see that they were
[1:12:57] persecuted and they rejoiced over their
[1:13:00] persecution Peter and the the apostles
[1:13:03] they prayed Lord let us be bold
[1:13:07] let us be bold Christians and that's
[1:13:11] what got them beaten
[1:13:14] their boldness that's what got them
[1:13:17] persecuted
[1:13:18] their boldness that's what got them
[1:13:20] thrown in prison was their beholdeness
[1:13:22] and then they come back and they said
[1:13:24] Lord let us be bold
[1:13:26] let us be even more bold it's because
[1:13:28] they had it right
[1:13:30] they had something that this world had
[1:13:34] never seen before
[1:13:36] they had the same Spirit of this man
[1:13:38] that died on the cross within them and
[1:13:41] they went out preaching the gospel
[1:13:43] talking about the word all the time and
[1:13:46] let me close with two scriptures here
[1:13:48] Proverbs chapter 20.
[1:13:51] verse 20
[1:13:53] . Solomon speaking he said my son
[1:13:56] attend to my words
[1:13:58] incline nine a year unto my sayings let
[1:14:02] them not depart from Thine Eyes keep
[1:14:04] them in the midst of thine heart for
[1:14:07] their life under the those that find
[1:14:09] them and health to all their flesh
[1:14:12] keep thy heart with all diligence for
[1:14:15] out of it are the issues of Life he's
[1:14:18] talking about the word
[1:14:20] let this always let it not depart from
[1:14:23] your eyes keep it in the midst of your
[1:14:25] heart then Deuteronomy chapter 6.
[1:14:29] I love this one sister if you could
[1:14:31] start this is this is just a beautiful
[1:14:33] scripture Deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 5.
[1:14:37] and thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[1:14:39] with all thy heart
[1:14:41] and with all thy soul and with all thy
[1:14:43] might and these words which I command
[1:14:46] thee this day shall be in thine heart
[1:14:51] and thou shalt teach them diligently
[1:14:53] unto thy children
[1:14:56] and shall talk of them when thou sittest
[1:14:58] in thy house
[1:15:00] and when thou walkest by the way and
[1:15:02] when thou lie us down and when thou
[1:15:04] arises up
[1:15:06] talking I was talking this morning about
[1:15:07] our children
[1:15:08] talk to them about this word
[1:15:11] let it always be a point of conversation
[1:15:14] in our homes
[1:15:17] and thou shalt bind them
[1:15:20] for a sign upon thy hand
[1:15:23] and they shall be as frontless between
[1:15:25] thine eyes
[1:15:27] let this always this word always be in
[1:15:30] me and thou shalt write them upon the
[1:15:33] doorposts of thy house upon the ports of
[1:15:35] thy house and on thy Gates
[1:15:38] how beautiful friends is the word how
[1:15:41] important is the word that we can read
[1:15:45] this book of Acts and and go every verse
[1:15:49] I was kind of rejoicing the other day
[1:15:51] thinking when we finished this book of
[1:15:53] Acts we're going to have read every
[1:15:55] single verse so let's not skip any we
[1:15:58] will have read every verse in front of
[1:16:00] the congregation
[1:16:01] and to think that that scripture I just
[1:16:04] read in Deuteronomy
[1:16:06] how we are able we're able to teach this
[1:16:10] word we're able to listen to it we're
[1:16:12] able to talk with our families with our
[1:16:14] wives and with our husbands about it and
[1:16:17] just rejoice in it Rejoice sometimes we
[1:16:20] we look at the book of Acts and
[1:16:23] and we look at ananias and the fire are
[1:16:27] coming and and and dying there and we
[1:16:30] think we think wow you know this really
[1:16:33] happened what if it happened in my
[1:16:34] church and and the thought came and I
[1:16:37] thought it was it was kind of funny like
[1:16:40] I'm gonna witness to people
[1:16:42] and tell them this is what's going on in
[1:16:45] our church but I'll tell you what if the
[1:16:47] power of God was with us
[1:16:50] people would want to be here
[1:16:52] and another thing they would want to be
[1:16:54] more honest they would want to be more
[1:16:57] Christian they would want to just live
[1:17:00] this life this book of Acts how
[1:17:03] beautiful
[1:17:04] is it I just sometimes I'll read it I
[1:17:07] just say yeah you know I love it and
[1:17:11] then other times I look at the Sadducees
[1:17:12] I'm like oh you guys are creeps why did
[1:17:16] you do that why did you act that way and
[1:17:18] then I see that same spirit
[1:17:22] in in today and how people treat each
[1:17:25] other and and I just think Lord let this
[1:17:29] book be written on my heart the Bible
[1:17:31] says with an iron pen
[1:17:33] let this these scriptures always be on
[1:17:37] my mind I want to talk with my wife
[1:17:39] about it all the time I want to talk
[1:17:41] with my son about all the time let this
[1:17:45] book
[1:17:46] this book of Acts let it be my ax how I
[1:17:51] act in this these coming days until
[1:17:54] Wednesday Lord let it be let it go
[1:17:57] before me as the ark went before and let
[1:18:00] me be part of this word amen
[1:18:04] do you love the book of Acts I love it
[1:18:06] so much that acts chapter 5 is just it's
[1:18:10] tremendous I was thinking I got done in
[1:18:12] 40 minutes I was thinking there's no way
[1:18:14] it's gonna take me two hours
[1:18:16] to get through this but sometimes you
[1:18:19] can just read it and it's just so much
[1:18:21] better let's stand

[1:20:52] and just be so thankful
[1:20:54] that brother branuman said that this was
[1:20:57] the book that Satan feared
[1:21:00] because he knew that Jesus had the power
[1:21:04] but he did not want the people to get it
[1:21:07] he did not want they to take the promise
[1:21:09] that was given that's right and in the
[1:21:11] books of Acts oh God
[1:21:14] we became what you said we could be
[1:21:17] amen oh Lord Jesus tonight father as
[1:21:19] we've heard these words and our faithful

[1:21:25] oh God we would take it to heart Lord
[1:21:27] Jesus take it with us in our homes take
[1:21:30] it with us in our minds let a lord just

[1:21:36] soul be fed and satisfied oh God
[1:21:40] for Lord we've loved the hearing of your
[1:21:42] word

[1:21:46] believe that help though I believe we
[1:21:48] you realize Lord that we are living in
[1:21:50] this sinful flesh but oh God you have
[1:21:53] provided a way that we can't be perfect
[1:21:55] if we would just believe your word and
[1:21:58] come through the shed blood of the Lord
[1:22:00] Jesus Christ asking for forgiveness of
[1:22:02] sins that we can be brought into your
[1:22:05] very presence o God give us the faith to
[1:22:08] believe this word Lord and we will have
[1:22:10] these things that we've been taught and
[1:22:13] told about it will become reality in our
[1:22:15] lives father we will see it it will just
[1:22:18] it will happen it will not be something
[1:22:21] Lord we would just talk about but oh God

[1:22:26] manifestation of the Son of God of each
[1:22:30] one in every person Lord for we are a
[1:22:32] part of that body
[1:22:34] her brother Branham said we must be a
[1:22:36] part of Christ and if we're a part of
[1:22:39] him
[1:22:40] Lord we know he he will not leave us he
[1:22:44] will not forsake us
[1:22:46] we thank you Lord for this promise but
[1:22:48] Lord we thank you for the faith that you
[1:22:50] will give us if we do not have it yet
[1:22:52] that we can believe your word because
[1:22:54] once we believe it father things will
[1:22:57] start happening in our lives maybe even

[1:23:02] doing in our lives Lord we see them The
