[16:48] Just a couple reminders and
[16:50] announcements. There is no service
[16:52] tonight and there's also no service
[16:55] Wednesday night. And then also at the
[16:58] end of service after everyone's done
[16:59] praying and musicians is closed, we're
[17:02] going to uh be clearing the chairs here
[17:04] in the main sanctuary. Brother Ed's
[17:06] organizing that. So if you brothers want
[17:08] to get with him after service to help
[17:11] him with that, that would be
[17:12] appreciated. We have a few praises, some
[17:15] prayer requests turned in this morning.
[17:18] Let's just go to the praises first.
[17:21] Sister Rachel Ghetta wants to just thank
[17:24] us for praying for Sister Meline Geta
[17:27] last Sunday. She went through her
[17:28] procedure just fine with no pain. Praise
[17:31] God.
[17:33] Amen.
[17:38] She asks that we continue to pray for
[17:40] her as she has one has a second part of
[17:43] the procedure this coming Thursday. So,
[17:45] let's just continue to keep her in
[17:47] prayer that the Lord would help her and
[17:49] strengthen her. Amen. Brother Ed and
[17:51] Sister Kathy have a few prayer requests.
[17:53] A couple um they first asked for uh
[17:56] their sister-in-law, Sister Susan
[17:57] Lepicart wants to thank everyone for our
[18:00] prayers. She's feeling better, but she
[18:03] still needs a touch from the Lord for a
[18:05] complete recovery. God bless you. And
[18:08] also from Brother Ed and sister Kathy
[18:10] Dooall, our daughter Ruth would like to
[18:12] thank everyone for praying for her. Her
[18:14] surgery went well. She is at home
[18:16] recovering. Thank you for praying for
[18:18] her full recovery. Amen.
[18:21] Then some requests here.
[18:23] Sister Sarah Codner requests prayer for
[18:26] her daughter Shana. For the last couple
[18:29] of months, she's been having stomach
[18:30] problems. Doctors are doing tests slowly
[18:33] but haven't found the cause. Still
[18:35] having more tests. God bless you. Sister
[18:39] Ameilia writes, "I have an unspoken
[18:41] prayer request, an urgent unspoken
[18:43] prayer request before the Lord. Please
[18:45] help me pray for this need. Thank you."
[18:48] Also, I talked to sister Sarah Zam
[18:50] Brunan. She when she came in, her dad's
[18:53] still in therapy. Be there another few
[18:55] weeks, it sounds like. And so, let's
[18:57] just continue to remember brother John
[18:59] in prayer and the family strengthen
[19:01] strengthened them all. Sister Kathleen,
[19:03] it's good to see you and the girls in
[19:04] service today. So, just remember them
[19:07] all. It's been a trying ordeal. The Lord
[19:09] is faithful. Amen. Brother Bobby Wartz.
[19:12] Uh we had some communications with him
[19:15] this week and Sister Barbara King and
[19:18] he's just started radiation and
[19:21] treatment and chemotherapy pills. So far
[19:23] he hasn't had any nauseousness from the
[19:26] pills and so they're just thankful for
[19:28] that. But it's obviously a lot of trying
[19:32] times for them and the strength is weak
[19:35] and so forth. So let's just remember him
[19:36] in prayer and his brother, brother
[19:38] Michael Wartz. It sounds like it's going
[19:39] better there, but they I'm sure would to
[19:42] covet our prayers. Continued prayers.
[19:44] Amen. You all have a need this morning.
[19:46] Want to make known with an uplifted hand
[19:49] and unspoken need. Let's just go before
[19:51] the Lord this morning. Lord, we know
[19:54] you're a great big God. You're our
[19:56] heavenly father. You dwell in heaven,
[19:59] Lord. You dwell in our hearts. You dwell
[20:00] in our midst, Lord. And you're able to
[20:03] take care of every one of our needs,
[20:04] Lord. You have the abundance and the
[20:07] riches of heaven and earth, Lord, at
[20:09] your disposal, Lord. The power and
[20:12] strength that we can't even understand,
[20:13] Lord. And you can take care of every
[20:15] need, Lord. You can satisfy every
[20:18] hunger, every thirst, Lord. You can take
[20:20] away the the wrong hungers and the wrong
[20:23] thirsts in our hearts, Lord, and replace
[20:25] them with good ones, Lord. We ask that
[20:27] your Holy Spirit would just come and
[20:28] dwell in our midst, Lord. Dwell in our
[20:31] lives, Lord. You would just help us,
[20:32] Lord. forgive us of our sins and our
[20:35] iniquities, Lord Jesus. We ask for these
[20:38] prayer requests, Lord, that you would
[20:40] just go to each one, each need, Lord.
[20:42] Touch each person, each individual, each
[20:45] family, Lord, spoken, Lord. Each hand
[20:47] that's been raised, Lord, would you just
[20:49] go and help each one, Lord? Thank you
[20:52] for your blessings in our lives. We
[20:54] thank you for the praises this morning.
[20:56] We just want to be sure to give you all
[20:58] the honor and the glory and praise for
[21:00] all that you've done for us, Lord. We
[21:02] thank you, Lord Jesus. And we ask that
[21:05] you would bless this offering and the
[21:06] tithes that would be given, Lord, that
[21:08] it' be used for your glory and your
[21:11] honor, Lord. We would do all things
[21:13] pleasing and acceptable to you, Lord. Be
[21:15] with the service this morning. Continue
[21:17] to be with our worship and praise, Lord,
[21:20] and our glory. Glory to you, Lord. Be
[21:22] with brother Daniel as he prepares,
[21:25] Lord, and prepare our hearts and our
[21:27] minds to hear from you, Lord. Jesus,
[21:29] help us this morning and be with us. We
[21:32] ask these things in your name, our Lord
[21:34] Jesus Christ. Amen.

[33:39] Hear your people.
[33:41] Hear your people sing.
[33:45] Holy
[33:48] to the King of Kings.
[33:52] Holy.
[33:53] [Music]
[33:55] You will always be
[33:59] holy,
[34:03] holy forever
[34:08] your name.
[34:11] And your name is the highest. Your name
[34:16] is the greatest. Your name
[34:20] stands above them all.
[34:25] All thrones and dominions
[34:28] and powers and positions. Your name
[34:33] stands above you in all your name.
[34:38] In your name is the highest. Your name
[34:43] is the greatest. Your name
[34:47] stands above them all.
[34:52] All thrones and dominions and powers and
[34:57] positions. Your name
[35:01] stands above them all.
[35:05] And the angels cry,
[35:10] "Holy,
[35:11] [Music]
[35:13] all creation
[35:15] cries,
[35:18] holy.
[35:20] [Music]
[35:21] You are lifted high,
[35:26] holy,
[35:28] [Music]
[35:30] holy forever."
[35:33] &gt;&gt; One more time on that verse. One more
[35:34] time.
[35:36] Yes.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; And the angels cry,
[35:41] &gt;&gt; "Holy
[35:42] [Music]
[35:45] creation
[35:47] cries,
[35:49] holy."
[35:52] You are lifted high,
[35:57] holy,
[35:59] [Music]
[36:01] holy forever.
[36:06] Lord God Almighty,
[36:09] Lord, to think the angels cry holy as
[36:13] they
[36:15] Lord fly around your throne. They cover
[36:17] their face and their feet in humility,
[36:21] crying holy, holy, holy unto the Lord.
[36:26] Father, to think that that same almighty
[36:29] God
[36:31] that created the heavens and the earth,
[36:34] that great eternal being
[36:37] would look down upon this congregation
[36:39] this morning
[36:41] and hear our prayers
[36:44] and receive our worship.
[36:46] We love you, God.
[36:49] Thank you for this opportunity. We pray
[36:52] Lord that your hand would be upon
[36:54] service
[36:56] and Lord that everyone would leave this
[36:58] building this morning.
[37:02] Everyone would leave
[37:04] like they did on the way the road to
[37:08] Emmas and they would say did not our
[37:10] hearts burn within us as he talked with
[37:13] us by the way. Father may the same be
[37:16] this morning. May the spirit speak
[37:19] something to each of us. I pray that
[37:22] they would bless us and bring us
[37:25] through. Lord, we ask in Jesus name.
[37:28] Amen. Amen.
[37:30] Friends,
[37:32] do you appreciate our worship team?
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[37:43] we are not worthy
[37:45] of the gifts that God has given us.
[37:47] Amen. You can be seated. God bless you.
[37:56] First, thank everybody for their
[37:57] patience in our construction. We uh the
[38:03] these walls are going to get dry stacked
[38:05] stone and and we're going to finish the
[38:07] outside walls here, but we're moving
[38:08] forward. The carpet's going to go in if
[38:10] the Lord's willing starting tomorrow.
[38:13] So, that's why all the chairs um have
[38:16] been moved from the north wing there.
[38:18] And then we're going to move after
[38:19] service, we'll move all of these chairs
[38:20] over there. So, we're moving. We're
[38:22] moving in in the right direction. Uh,
[38:25] somebody left a carpet right here.
[38:31] I did. This is the carpet.
[38:34] That's that's going to go on the floor.
[38:38] I didn't mean to leave it there, but I
[38:40] did.
[38:42] Uh, you know,
[38:46] I think the Lord
[38:48] I think he likes the way he way he made
[38:51] us. I really do. I think he's I think
[38:54] he's proud of us and I think we all have
[38:56] things to overcome and with our church
[38:58] and moving forward. I think that um it's
[39:02] going to be really nice. I don't think
[39:04] we'll ever finish. We'll always be
[39:05] constantly doing something. But I think
[39:07] it's going to be really really nice when
[39:09] when we get done. Uh, welcome to our
[39:12] visitors, Russell and Linda Lee. I met
[39:14] you before service back there with the
[39:16] Rory. God bless you. Welcome. It's good
[39:18] to have you. I think the world of that
[39:19] kid.
[39:25] It's good to have you, Alex. Who is this
[39:26] with you?
[39:28] &gt;&gt; Josh. Joshua.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; Nice to meet you, Joshua. Welcome. God
[39:32] bless you. You're always welcome to
[39:33] come. We appreciate bless you. If I miss
[39:37] any other visitors, I want to tell you
[39:40] we appreciate you coming and worshiping
[39:42] with us this morning.
[39:45] I uh like I said, I think the Lord,
[39:49] he makes us in certain ways. And we all
[39:52] think that, wow, I wish that I could do
[39:55] this better. I wish I was better at
[39:57] that. Or I I constantly keep making this
[39:59] mistake over and over.
[40:02] But I want to stand back for a minute
[40:05] and look. I think he's pleased with the
[40:07] way he made us each. I think he gave us
[40:09] each weaknesses
[40:11] &gt;&gt; and those weaknesses God can take those
[40:14] weaknesses and turn them around and be a
[40:17] glory to him. So I think that we we get
[40:20] down at our on ourselves sometimes but
[40:24] and you have weaknesses and you should
[40:26] overcome these weaknesses but remember
[40:28] God made you that way. Somebody asked,
[40:32] we were with the kids last night in the
[40:34] upper room and uh one of the youth
[40:37] asked,"Well, why do why did God allow
[40:41] sin to come in the world? Why didn't he
[40:43] just make it perfect?" That's a question
[40:46] that wow so many people have asked,
[40:48] especially when they're wondering,
[40:49] "Should I serve God or not? Is this God
[40:51] real? Why would he make people sin and
[40:55] do really awful things all the way back
[40:58] to the Garden of Eden?" Cain killed his
[41:01] brother Abel, one of the very first
[41:04] people that had ever lived. God allowed
[41:07] sin there. And you can see why someone
[41:09] who might be a a new Christian or or
[41:12] wondering about God and how he does
[41:14] things. Why would he allow this? Why
[41:18] would he allow sin? Why would he allow
[41:20] suffering? So many people suffer. We all
[41:22] suffer. Why does God allow it? And they
[41:25] so the kids asked that last night
[41:28] and the answer is there. I asked I asked
[41:31] some of the youth around and some of
[41:33] them came up with some very good answers
[41:34] and I think they were all right. One of
[41:36] the answers was well it builds character
[41:39] in us this suffering. It does very very
[41:42] good answer. It does it builds it builds
[41:44] character and and it just it helps us
[41:47] all the way. But the answer is one of
[41:50] the main reason that he allowed sin in
[41:53] the world is because he was God and God
[41:57] has attributes. God is a father. The
[42:00] father created the heavens and the
[42:02] earth. He was the beginning of it. But
[42:05] God is also a savior.
[42:08] So to be a savior, you have to have
[42:12] something to save. and you would have
[42:15] nothing to save if there wasn't failure
[42:18] in the world. So God allowed each of us
[42:21] to have weaknesses and he allowed Adam
[42:24] and Eve to have weaknesses. He allowed
[42:26] every person to have a weakness.
[42:29] And when they don't follow God and they
[42:34] act on those weaknesses, like we
[42:36] shouldn't do, but when we do, then God
[42:40] the Savior steps in.
[42:44] and he takes care of it and we just lay
[42:46] it at his feet. And
[42:50] I do believe I believe he makes us with
[42:53] these these weaknesses.
[42:57] And I know I feel like the Bible says,
[43:01] "Confess your faults one to another."
[43:03] And it's like, "Okay, here comes pastor.
[43:05] He's going to tell us another thing that
[43:07] he did wrong." And I do. I I have
[43:11] weaknesses. And yesterday
[43:15] we uh one of the kids at the youth uh
[43:19] gathering that we had last night, one of
[43:21] the kids asked a question.
[43:24] And the question was that some friends
[43:27] were asking questions about maybe why
[43:30] she dresses a certain way or why she um
[43:33] her hair is done a certain way. And she
[43:36] asked why do different denominations
[43:41] why do they believe different things
[43:44] and why she didn't say this but why is
[43:46] there conflict between different
[43:49] churches and different ways of thinking
[43:52] and my answer was I just went back to
[43:55] Jesus's time and I I described the
[43:57] different denominations that were in
[43:58] Jesus's time there were the Pharisees
[44:00] which were the common people they
[44:02] believed in prophets they believed in
[44:04] the resurrection and there was a
[44:05] Sadducees and they only believed in
[44:07] Moses. They were very legalistic. They
[44:09] only believed in temple worship. And
[44:11] then someone mentioned the Zealots. The
[44:13] Zealots were they believed that the
[44:15] Romans should be overthrown and the
[44:17] Messiah would be a great m great
[44:20] military leader. And then basically I
[44:23] said that they all had different
[44:25] perspectives in the Bible and on the
[44:27] Bible and God can use these different
[44:29] perspectives for his own good. While
[44:33] some may be good at at speaking to this
[44:36] group, well, they might not be good at
[44:39] speaking to that group and then that
[44:41] group um might be good to speaking at
[44:43] this group and and then God makes a way
[44:46] for everybody really to come in. So, I I
[44:47] gave that explanation
[44:50] and I'm very careful with the kids. I I
[44:55] don't want them to get the wrong idea
[44:57] about things. I want them to live moral
[44:59] lives. I want them to come to church. I
[45:00] want them to fellowship with each other.
[45:02] I don't want to get let them get caught
[45:04] up in different divisional doctrines and
[45:07] that and I I I simply answer their
[45:09] questions very simply and I try to just
[45:12] bring them back to the Bible. Well, I
[45:14] was driving home last night and
[45:20] I felt the Lord was maybe speaking to
[45:24] me. And all of us have that where you
[45:26] feel like the Lord's telling you
[45:27] something. all of us, we should we
[45:30] should have that voice that there's
[45:33] something that he's just talking to you
[45:36] and you listen and and I felt like he
[45:39] was telling me you didn't answer
[45:44] the question.
[45:47] And I said, I know.
[45:51] And then I felt like he said, well,
[45:54] what are you going to do about it?
[45:58] And then I said, "Well, confess on
[46:02] Sunday morning and tell everybody."
[46:06] And I I think it God maybe used my
[46:09] weakness
[46:11] and maybe not in in just being very
[46:14] careful.
[46:16] And I think God wanted me to address
[46:17] that in front of the whole congregation
[46:19] this morning.
[46:21] And I think it's more appropriate to do
[46:23] it in in front of the congregation. As I
[46:25] said, I'm very careful with the kids. I
[46:27] I just want to be very very easy with
[46:31] them and just point them to the Lord
[46:33] Jesus. Point them to their parents
[46:36] because and I tell them all the time,
[46:37] your parents love you more than anyone
[46:39] else in this world. So always stick with
[46:42] mom and dad because they will stick with
[46:44] you.
[46:46] So the question, why do we have so many
[46:50] denominations today and and why are
[46:52] there so many different doctrines? And I
[46:54] will add to that question. Why do these
[46:57] doctrines separate us so much? And why
[47:00] do we believe so differently? And we all
[47:02] claim to be Christians.
[47:04] The Sadducees, let's go back to Jesus's
[47:06] time. The Sadducees had a doctrine that
[47:08] separated them from everyone else. They
[47:11] believed that the temple was the
[47:13] headquarters and anything any worship
[47:15] outside of the temple was sub subpar. It
[47:19] was below standard to them. That they
[47:21] were the elite.
[47:23] They were the chosen of God. They didn't
[47:25] believe in angels. They didn't believe
[47:26] in the supernatural. They believed that
[47:28] Moses, the prophet, was the absolute and
[47:32] the true mouthpiece of God. And none of
[47:34] the other prophets were up to that
[47:37] standard. This is what the Sadducees
[47:38] believe. They did not believe in a
[47:40] resurrection. There were no miracles.
[47:42] There were no healings. They believed
[47:44] only the first five books of the Bible
[47:47] written by Moses. They believed that
[47:49] those were the only ones that were truly
[47:51] inspired by God. and they were open to
[47:53] working with Rome, their occupiers,
[47:58] and making deals with the Roman Empire.
[48:01] That was a that was a Sadducees. The
[48:03] Pharisees,
[48:05] they had doctrines that separated them
[48:06] from everyone else. They believed in the
[48:09] prophets. They believed in the
[48:10] resurrection. They believed in miracles.
[48:11] They believed in the temple worship. But
[48:13] they also had synagogues throughout
[48:15] Israel and and other places in the
[48:17] world. They believed in angels. They
[48:19] believed in the observance of over 600
[48:23] commandments in the Bible.
[48:26] They believed interpreting interpreting
[48:28] the law in a contemporary way, adapting
[48:32] the law to modern issues.
[48:34] They did not agree for the most part
[48:37] with the Sadducees making deals with the
[48:40] Roman Empire. And this all was less than
[48:44] these Pharisees. They were they were the
[48:46] elites. They were better than the other
[48:48] ones. So they were the elite and chosen
[48:51] of God because of their doctrines.
[48:53] And then I believe it was Josiah
[48:56] mentioned the Zealots.
[48:58] And there was one of Jesus's disciples
[49:00] that was a Zealot. No, Simon. They did
[49:04] not believe that the Roman Empire should
[49:07] have any part in Jewish life. They
[49:09] believed that just the presence of the
[49:11] Roman Empire was in violation of their
[49:14] God-given rights to their land. Their
[49:18] deep commitments
[49:20] to the Torah, to Moses's writing,
[49:24] justified their violent ways in their
[49:27] violent opposition to Rome, their
[49:29] occupiers. The Pharisees and the
[49:32] Sadducees,
[49:34] they were elite over the Pharisees and
[49:36] the Sadducees because of those
[49:40] doctrines. They were the elite and the
[49:43] chosen of God. So, they all have one
[49:46] thing in common.
[49:47] They all have a couple things in common.
[49:49] They all have Moses in common. And they
[49:51] all think that they are better than
[49:52] everybody else. These are all Jews.
[49:55] These are all people that believe the
[49:56] same. So each one of these three three
[49:58] groups, they separated themselves
[50:00] because of certain doctrines. As I said,
[50:04] they believed all they all believe the
[50:05] same prophet.
[50:07] And we think as we look back on the
[50:09] Pharisees and the Sadducees and the
[50:10] Herodians and the Zealots and and them,
[50:13] we think that they're all wrong. But I
[50:16] asked the congregation today and as I'm
[50:18] ministering this morning, if you lived
[50:21] in the times of Jesus, you would have
[50:24] probably been part of one of these
[50:26] groups. And I ask you, would you have
[50:29] had the doctrines
[50:31] that put you at the top of the list
[50:34] saying that this is the most important
[50:36] thing that I believe and I would have
[50:39] separated you or you would have
[50:42] separated yourself from the other Jews.
[50:45] All
[50:45] right. So, put yourself in these
[50:48] positions as I'm talking about this.
[50:50] Where would you have been? Would you
[50:53] have had doctrines that separated
[50:57] yourself from other believers and put
[51:01] those doctrines up to the top and made
[51:04] those doctrines more important than the
[51:06] other ones, just like they did.
[51:09] And times change, friends. Times change,
[51:13] but spirits don't change and people
[51:14] don't change. So, the same things going
[51:17] on today would be the same things that
[51:19] were going on back then. I want to
[51:22] continue on our prayer series. And as
[51:23] I'm reading from this prayer from Jesus
[51:26] that I'm about to read from, I want you
[51:28] to ask yourself what Jesus thought was
[51:32] important when he's praying.
[51:35] And if and do your doctrines
[51:38] line up with what he thought was
[51:41] important and what doctrine was what
[51:45] doctrine was most important to these
[51:47] Pharisees and Sadducees to separate them
[51:49] from Jesus? And do you have doctrines?
[51:52] Do I have doctrines? Do any of us have
[51:53] doctrines that are so important that we
[51:56] would want to separate ourselves from
[51:58] Jesus Christ today
[52:01] and still say we believe Moses? Still
[52:02] say we believe Jesus. I want you to put
[52:05] yourself in this position as we go
[52:08] through Christ's really final prayer for
[52:12] the church.
[52:15] What doctrine do we have that separates
[52:17] us from other Christians? When Jesus
[52:20] said that there will be one fold
[52:24] and one shepherd,
[52:27] what doctrine do we have to separate us
[52:29] from that fold or to say that we are the
[52:32] only fold? When Jesus prays that his
[52:34] disciples would be one, what doctrine do
[52:37] we have that encourages us to separate
[52:40] from the other believers in Christ?
[52:43] And would your doctrine would it justify
[52:46] going against this prayer of Jesus
[52:48] Christ and do the same that the
[52:49] Pharisees and Sadducees did?
[52:52] As we're going through this prayer, as
[52:55] always, put yourself in the Bible. Where
[52:58] would you have stood?
[53:01] So the question is why do we have so
[53:05] many different beliefs and still call
[53:08] ourselves Christians?
[53:11] And it's a that's something I want
[53:12] everyone to consider this morning. And
[53:15] I'll go a little farther and I'll say
[53:17] that if we separate ourselves on the
[53:19] same lines that the Pharisees did, and
[53:23] there's there's many ways to separate
[53:25] ourselves. baptism,
[53:28] clothing, political views,
[53:31] claiming leaders,
[53:34] Martin Luther, John Wesley, Willie um
[53:37] William William Brandom, Billy Graham,
[53:40] Sunday worship versus Saturday worship,
[53:42] different Bible translations is a big
[53:44] one. I've heard different people outside
[53:47] of our church say that our church is
[53:50] right because we use the King James
[53:53] Bible and not knowing anything about
[53:55] what we teach or anything about the
[53:57] doctrines that this pastor teaches, but
[54:00] just because you use the King James
[54:02] Bible, you must be right.
[54:06] It's so easy.
[54:09] And they're here this morning. Think
[54:12] about it yourself. All of us. I'm just
[54:14] presenting the question and you make
[54:17] your own decision on your own personal
[54:19] beliefs and then you make the decision
[54:20] on if you would be one that fights
[54:23] against this prayer that I'm about to
[54:25] read or if it or if you would support it
[54:28] today.
[54:30] We've been going on for the visitors.
[54:31] We've been going this on this series of
[54:34] of uh on the subject of prayer. And I
[54:37] say it every time. It's the most
[54:38] important thing that a man or a woman
[54:40] can do is pray.
[54:43] And here
[54:45] is Jesus's really his final prayer for
[54:47] the church. This is the same night that
[54:51] he had the last supper. This is the same
[54:54] night that he was stolen away and taken
[54:58] to be crucified. This is the same night
[55:00] that he was with his disciples and he
[55:02] was praying for for them. This is the
[55:04] same night that he was betrayed by
[55:06] Judas. This is the end of his mortal
[55:10] life. The last night that Jesus Christ
[55:14] is on the earth. And this is a this is
[55:18] the big prayer. And as I read it, ask
[55:22] yourself if the doctrines that separate
[55:25] you from other Christians line up with
[55:29] Jesus Christ. We all call ourselves
[55:31] Christians.
[55:33] John chapter 17. We'll read the whole
[55:36] prayer.
[55:39] John chapter 17 says this.
[55:43] These words spake Jesus and lifted up
[55:47] his eyes to heaven and said, "Father,
[55:49] the hour is come. glorify thy son that
[55:52] thy son also may glorify thee
[55:56] as thou hast given him
[55:59] power over all flesh that he should give
[56:03] eternal life to as many as thou hast
[56:05] given him. So he's not separating
[56:07] anybody right here except those who give
[56:11] their lives to Christ and those who
[56:13] don't.
[56:15] Verse number three. And this is life
[56:18] eternal, that they might know thee, the
[56:21] only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom
[56:24] thou hast sent.
[56:26] I love that part. I I just I love that
[56:28] part. This is one of my favorite verses
[56:30] in the whole Bible. Remember, Jesus last
[56:33] name is not Christ.
[56:36] Christ is a title. It's a Greek word for
[56:40] for the Hebrew word Messiah. And this is
[56:43] the only place that I know of that Jesus
[56:45] called himself Jesus Christ. The entire
[56:48] Bible
[56:50] from Genesis to Revelation is really
[56:52] it's about this one man
[56:55] about this man Jesus. Again, from
[56:57] Genesis all the way to the end of
[56:59] Revelation, it is about one man
[57:03] &gt;&gt; and that man is God. And you know what?
[57:06] That man's whole life
[57:08] was about me.
[57:12] was about you.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; That whole Bible is about one man and
[57:16] his life was about me.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Let that soak in.
[57:26] He gave his life for us. He did
[57:28] everything for us. And the whole Bible,
[57:30] everything about the word is about Jesus
[57:32] Christ. And yet he lived his life for me
[57:34] and he gave his life for me.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; I have glorified thee on earth.
[57:39] I have finished the work which thou
[57:41] gavest me to do. Jesus is praying here.
[57:43] Again, remember this is it.
[57:46] This is the final prayer for the church.
[57:51] I have glorified thee on earth. I have
[57:53] finished the work which thou gavest me
[57:54] to do. And now, f oh father, glorify
[57:57] thou me with thine own self, with the
[58:01] glory which I had with thee before the
[58:04] world was. I have manifested thy name
[58:06] unto the men which thou gavest me out of
[58:09] the world. Thine they were, and thou
[58:12] gavest them me, and they have kept thy
[58:15] word. He's talking about his disciples.
[58:18] Now they have known that all things
[58:20] whatsoever thou hast given me are of
[58:22] thee.
[58:24] For I have given unto them the words
[58:26] which thou gavest me and they have
[58:28] received them
[58:30] and they have known and have known
[58:32] surely that I came out from thee and
[58:35] they have believed that thou didest send
[58:37] me. So the first part of this whole
[58:40] prayer is that Jesus saves us from our
[58:43] sins and these disciples believe Jesus
[58:45] and that Jesus should be glorified.
[58:47] Nothing else.
[58:49] Remember this is it. This is the
[58:51] exclamation point at the end.
[58:54] of his ministry.
[58:57] It's all about Jesus.
[58:59] And where there are division, divisive
[59:02] doctrines that separate, where are these
[59:04] in his prayer?
[59:07] Where are all these little doctrines
[59:09] that divide the churches, that divide
[59:11] the denominations? They are not present.
[59:13] At least they're not present yet in this
[59:15] prayer. And we'll keep going.
[59:19] I pray for them.
[59:21] I pray not for the world, but for them
[59:23] which thou hast given me. For they are
[59:25] thine, and all are mine, and and all
[59:29] mine are thine, and thine are mine, and
[59:32] I am glorified in them. I am glorified
[59:36] in them. Who's glorified in them? Jesus
[59:39] Christ is glorified in his disciples.
[59:43] Have you seen any justification yet for
[59:45] any division?
[59:47] It gets stronger. So does Jesus's very
[59:51] disciples. All those that take on the
[59:53] name Christian, Jesus is glorified in
[59:57] their lives. So how many people I told a
[1:00:00] story last week about a woman that was
[1:00:04] going to going to a church back east and
[1:00:06] she said, "I love the things that Jesus
[1:00:08] says. I I love his doctrines. I I love I
[1:00:11] love all of all of everything about
[1:00:13] Jesus, but I would be a Christian. if it
[1:00:15] wasn't for the Christians and how the
[1:00:18] Christians act.
[1:00:22] And I think that we glorify Jesus
[1:00:25] Christ. Someone should look at us and
[1:00:28] want to be like us.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Never feel
[1:00:33] like they have been mistreated by us but
[1:00:35] have been loved by us. And there should
[1:00:38] be that draw of the Holy Spirit that
[1:00:43] that people want to be a Christian
[1:00:47] because of the Christians.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; They shouldn't not want to be a
[1:00:52] Christian because of the Christians.
[1:00:53] They should want to be a Christian
[1:00:54] because of the way a Christian acts.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; And Jesus here is saying, he's like,
[1:00:58] they glorify me.
[1:01:01] I am glorified in them.
[1:01:06] And now I am no more in the world, but
[1:01:10] these are in the world. And I come to
[1:01:12] thee, holy father, keep through thine
[1:01:15] own name those who thou hast given me,
[1:01:18] and may they be one as we are one.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; So who's Jesus? Who's he praying for
[1:01:26] here? He's praying that they may be one
[1:01:31] as as the as the father and the son are
[1:01:34] one. And who is he talking about? He's
[1:01:35] talking about the church. He's talking
[1:01:38] about Christians.
[1:01:41] Is there anywhere yet that we can
[1:01:43] justify separating ourselves in Jesus's
[1:01:45] prayer?
[1:01:47] That they may be one as we are one.
[1:01:50] Who's he talking about? Is he talking
[1:01:51] about the Pharisees? Is he talking about
[1:01:52] the s Sadducees?
[1:01:57] He's talking about those that follow
[1:01:59] him.
[1:02:01] While I was yet with them, while I was
[1:02:03] with them in the world, I kept them in
[1:02:05] thy name. Those who thou those who those
[1:02:09] that thou gavest me, I have kept. And
[1:02:12] none of them is lost, but the son of
[1:02:13] predition, that the scripture might be
[1:02:15] fulfilled. So which Christian is lost?
[1:02:18] Only the son of destruction, and that's
[1:02:19] Judas, the one that betrayed Jesus for
[1:02:23] something else.
[1:02:27] And now come I to the unto thee to thee.
[1:02:30] And these things I speak in the world
[1:02:32] that they might have my glory fulfilled
[1:02:35] in themselves. My joy, I'm sorry.
[1:02:39] That they might have my joy fulfilled in
[1:02:41] themselves. He's praying that a
[1:02:44] Christian life would bring us joy. And
[1:02:48] it does bring us joy.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; It doesn't bring us hardships. It
[1:02:51] doesn't it doesn't bring us these heavy
[1:02:54] burdens. We put our burdens on him. But
[1:02:56] instead, so many people who call
[1:02:58] themselves Christians, call themselves
[1:03:00] believers are miserable
[1:03:03] because they think that it's their they
[1:03:06] think that their separation, their
[1:03:09] doctrines are more important, their core
[1:03:11] doctrines, and they take themselves and
[1:03:14] they bring themselves outside of Christ
[1:03:16] and it makes them miserable. It makes
[1:03:19] them miserable because they're thinking
[1:03:20] about all the bad things, all the
[1:03:22] problems. And it's just it it makes a
[1:03:25] miserable person. And Jesus is here is
[1:03:28] saying, "Listen, if you truly accept me,
[1:03:31] you're going to have joy.
[1:03:33] Your life is going to get better.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Your life is going to be filled with
[1:03:38] this spirit. Where there's divisions, he
[1:03:42] doesn't want us to have those. At least
[1:03:44] so far in his prayer, we don't see any
[1:03:46] divisions. Where are the doctrines that
[1:03:48] that try to separate us in this prayer?
[1:03:50] They're not there. He's saying that you
[1:03:52] need to be one
[1:03:54] and it's all about one and that's
[1:03:56] Christ.
[1:03:58] I have given them thy word and the world
[1:04:01] hath hated them because they are not of
[1:04:03] the world even as I am not of the world.
[1:04:07] And when someone preaches Christ
[1:04:10] truly Christ,
[1:04:13] then he's hated in the world. And he's
[1:04:15] especially hated in church
[1:04:19] all the way back. The religious spirit
[1:04:22] that claims to believe the Bible is the
[1:04:25] strongest spirit against Christ.
[1:04:29] The strongest spirit against God was not
[1:04:32] Mary Magdalene.
[1:04:34] was not Peter out on his boat. The
[1:04:37] strongest spirit against Christ was in
[1:04:39] the churches,
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; was in the synagogues. Those were the
[1:04:44] ones that crucified him. Those were the
[1:04:46] ones that hated him.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; And it was because not of their sins.
[1:04:52] Not because one was a prostitute over
[1:04:54] here and it and and she was not because
[1:04:56] one was a a liar and a cheat over here
[1:04:58] with Matthew and he was not because of
[1:05:01] them but because of Annis and Ananas
[1:05:06] and Simon the the Pharisee. They were
[1:05:09] the ones that wanted to kill Jesus. It
[1:05:11] was the religious people.
[1:05:14] Jesus Christ did not line up with the
[1:05:16] Pharisees and Sadducees or the zealots
[1:05:19] even though all three believed the
[1:05:20] prophet Moses.
[1:05:23] I pray not that thou should takes them
[1:05:25] take them out of the world but thou
[1:05:27] should keep them from evil. They are not
[1:05:30] of the world even as I am not of the
[1:05:32] world. So the Sadducees would say the
[1:05:33] Pharisees are of the world and the
[1:05:35] Pharisees would say that the zealots are
[1:05:37] are of the world.
[1:05:40] Pharisees and the Sadducees and
[1:05:43] everybody else is all looking at each
[1:05:45] other
[1:05:47] and they're all in the world.
[1:05:50] And Jesus is like, "Hey, come out of the
[1:05:52] world." We think of the world as being
[1:05:55] drugs and alcohol and all that. And that
[1:05:57] is, but it is also that Pharisee and
[1:06:00] Sadducee spirit. It's very worldly.
[1:06:03] Sanctify them through thy truth. Thy
[1:06:06] word is truth. As thou has sent me into
[1:06:08] the world, even so I have also sent them
[1:06:12] into the world. And for their sakes I
[1:06:15] sanctify myself, that they also might be
[1:06:18] sanctified through the truth. Neither
[1:06:20] pray I for these alone, but for them
[1:06:22] also which shall be which shall believe
[1:06:26] on me through their their word.
[1:06:30] So believe on me through their word. I
[1:06:31] believe that Jesus is praying for the
[1:06:33] Tucson tabernacle
[1:06:35] back then.
[1:06:37] And now it is manifested in people who
[1:06:40] truly believe Jesus Christ here in our
[1:06:42] church and in many other churches. And
[1:06:44] notice it says, "But for them also which
[1:06:47] shall believe on me
[1:06:49] through their word, not certain
[1:06:51] doctrines that separate outside of
[1:06:54] Christ, but believe on me." Jesus Christ
[1:06:56] is what he's saying. If I be lifted up,
[1:06:58] he said, I'll draw all men to me. And
[1:07:01] then he said another place, no one can
[1:07:03] come to the father except by me.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:09] Neither neither pray I for these alone,
[1:07:12] but for them which shall believe on me
[1:07:14] through their word, that they all may be
[1:07:16] one.
[1:07:18] As thou, Father art in me, this is the
[1:07:20] second time. As thou, Father, art in me,
[1:07:23] and I in thee, and they also may be may
[1:07:27] be one in us, that the world may believe
[1:07:30] that thou hast sent me. One who? that
[1:07:33] they may be one, one in Christ.
[1:07:38] And if we can just become one in Jesus
[1:07:40] Christ, then the world will believe that
[1:07:43] God sent Jesus Christ. The world will
[1:07:46] become Christians because of the oneness
[1:07:48] that Christians are with each other.
[1:07:52] Each church, if you truly have love and
[1:07:54] unity within that church, the world is
[1:07:56] going to see it. And the world's going
[1:07:58] to want to be part of that.
[1:08:01] And the glory which thou gavest me,
[1:08:04] I have given them that they may be one
[1:08:07] even as we are one.
[1:08:16] I wonder,
[1:08:18] stop there for a minute.
[1:08:20] Think about your prayers.
[1:08:22] You wake up in the morning, you pray
[1:08:25] your noon time prayers, your evening
[1:08:26] prayers. Whenever you pray, think about
[1:08:29] what you pray for.
[1:08:32] And are you praying for what Jesus
[1:08:33] prayed for?
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Are you praying for unity in the body of
[1:08:39] Christ?
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Are you praying what Jesus prayed in his
[1:08:44] last prayer for the church that they
[1:08:46] would be one? Why are we not praying for
[1:08:49] that? How much would unity mean in our
[1:08:52] lives? How much unity? How much would
[1:08:54] unity mean between a husband and a wife,
[1:08:56] between a father and a son, between a
[1:08:58] daughter and her mother? How much would
[1:09:00] that unity be? It would it would change
[1:09:03] the world if we would really desire
[1:09:06] unity and love for one another and set
[1:09:08] aside these little things that separate
[1:09:11] us. If we just had that desire, if we
[1:09:13] just put that at the top of our prayer
[1:09:15] list all the time, then things would
[1:09:18] change.
[1:09:19] But instead,
[1:09:21] we're not praying for what Jesus prayed
[1:09:24] for. The book of Acts, when Peter was in
[1:09:26] prison,
[1:09:28] he was taken. They were going to execute
[1:09:30] him. The church in unity, they got
[1:09:33] together and they made prayer without
[1:09:35] ceasing for Peter.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; And then a angel came, brought him out,
[1:09:41] brought him home. He walked in. They
[1:09:44] were continually praying. Look what
[1:09:46] Unity did at that time.
[1:09:49] And Jesus said, "If just two of you will
[1:09:51] agree, just look at unity. If just two
[1:09:54] of you will agree when you pray,
[1:09:57] then you will receive what you ask for."
[1:09:59] Just unity between two people. Imagine
[1:10:01] if we had unity between 150 people.
[1:10:06] Imagine if we had unity with believers
[1:10:08] around the world.
[1:10:11] Again,
[1:10:13] as I asked you before, does your
[1:10:14] doctrine line up with this Jesus's
[1:10:17] prayer?
[1:10:18] And the glory which thou gavest me, I
[1:10:21] have given them that they may be one
[1:10:23] even as we are one. I in them and thou
[1:10:25] in me. That they may be made perfect in
[1:10:28] one. Whoa. May be made perfect in one.
[1:10:32] So unity brings on perfection
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; and that the world may know that thou
[1:10:38] hast sent me and hast loved them as thou
[1:10:42] hast loved me. Again, he's saying this
[1:10:44] unity is going to represent Jesus Christ
[1:10:47] to the world. Father, I will that they
[1:10:50] also whom thou hast given me be with me
[1:10:53] where I am, that they may behold my
[1:10:55] glory which thou hast given me, for thou
[1:10:57] lovest me before the foundation of the
[1:10:59] world. Jesus is praying that the ones
[1:11:03] God gave him,
[1:11:05] that he would be able to spend an
[1:11:06] eternity with them.
[1:11:12] Oh righteous father, the world hath not
[1:11:14] known thee, but I have known thee. And
[1:11:17] these have known that thou hast sent me.
[1:11:19] And I have declared unto them thy name,
[1:11:22] and will declare it, that the love
[1:11:24] wherewith thou hast loved me may be in
[1:11:27] them, and I in them.
[1:11:30] Why is Jesus Why is Jesus's prayer here
[1:11:34] not constantly in our prayers? We forget
[1:11:37] the power of unity.
[1:11:40] I truly do not believe that Jesus would
[1:11:44] have prayed this if it were not possible
[1:11:49] to be there to happen. I believe that
[1:11:52] one day the church will come into unity.
[1:11:54] I believe that with all of my heart. And
[1:11:56] it's not this denomination or that
[1:11:58] denomination, this church or that
[1:12:00] church. It's the ones that have Christ
[1:12:03] associated with their name, Christians.
[1:12:06] Those are the ones that will come
[1:12:09] together in unity one day. Jesus Christ
[1:12:13] himself our Lord prayed for it.
[1:12:17] So the answer to the question about why
[1:12:20] different people believe different
[1:12:21] things and the reason we separate
[1:12:23] ourselves in those doctrines is because
[1:12:25] we lift those doctrines
[1:12:28] above Jesus Christ just as the Pharisees
[1:12:31] and Sadducees and the zealots and the
[1:12:32] rest of them did. We put those doctrines
[1:12:36] above this prayer of Christ.
[1:12:39] And again ask,
[1:12:42] what doctrine do I have that separates
[1:12:45] me from another Christian from another
[1:12:48] Christian church? And does that please
[1:12:51] Jesus?
[1:12:54] And one day that prayer of Jesus Christ
[1:12:56] will be answered. And I want to be part
[1:12:59] of it.
[1:13:00] Now, I have 15 minutes and I want to get
[1:13:04] into the Lord's prayer.
[1:13:06] Um,
[1:13:08] how could these things happen? How could
[1:13:10] unity truly come to pass?
[1:13:13] Really, if we would just do what the
[1:13:15] Lord prayed when he says he said, "Pray
[1:13:18] like this.
[1:13:20] If we would just do what the Lord's
[1:13:21] prayer is, then we would come into
[1:13:24] unity." Look at look at how beautiful it
[1:13:25] is. Let me let me give a background
[1:13:27] first. I asked the kids last night. I
[1:13:28] said, "There's something that most
[1:13:30] Christians recite in the Lord's Prayer
[1:13:32] that's not actually in the Bible. Our
[1:13:35] Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be
[1:13:37] thy name."
[1:13:39] Does anybody who Anybody know what it
[1:13:40] is? Not the kids. Let me let me read it.
[1:13:44] I I'll recite it. Our Father, who art in
[1:13:46] heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy
[1:13:49] kingdom come, thy will be done in earth
[1:13:51] as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
[1:13:54] daily bread. Forgive us not of forgive
[1:13:57] us of our trespasses as we forgive those
[1:13:59] who trespass pass against us. Lead us
[1:14:02] not into temptation, but deliver us from
[1:14:04] evil. For thine is the the kingdom and
[1:14:06] the power and the glory forever.
[1:14:09] The trespass part.
[1:14:12] Um where's Lily? Lily nailed it last
[1:14:14] night. It's debts
[1:14:16] and the trespass part to go back and I
[1:14:19] geeked out about on this a little bit
[1:14:20] over the week over the during the week
[1:14:22] and I was studying why does it say why'
[1:14:24] they change it? Why' they change it to
[1:14:26] trespass rather than debts?
[1:14:29] And it's because William Tinddale,
[1:14:32] and I I'll just do a little aside here.
[1:14:34] William Tinddale was one of the first
[1:14:37] English one of the first very good
[1:14:38] English translators of the Bible. So, he
[1:14:41] translated the Bible way back way back
[1:14:44] when and you know, they burned him at
[1:14:46] the stake for it because heaven forbid
[1:14:48] that someone get their own relationship
[1:14:50] with with Christ. Someone get their own
[1:14:52] relationship with God. Tendell suffered
[1:14:54] for his translation by being burned at
[1:14:56] the stake. But his translation came out
[1:14:58] and his translation
[1:15:01] there was not correct.
[1:15:04] He said, "Forgive us of our trespasses
[1:15:07] as we forgive those that trespass
[1:15:08] against us." But then when the King
[1:15:10] James Bible came out in every subsequent
[1:15:13] Bible, it says debts and debtors.
[1:15:15] Forgive us of our debts as we as we
[1:15:17] forgive um our debtors. So what happened
[1:15:21] was the Church of England, let me let me
[1:15:23] read this right here. This came from
[1:15:26] classic theology website. It says this.
[1:15:29] But how did Tendale's translation get so
[1:15:31] popular? It's because it was used in the
[1:15:34] 1549 book of common prayer, which is the
[1:15:37] official book of lurggy of the church of
[1:15:40] England. And at that time, his
[1:15:42] translation was one of the most readily
[1:15:43] available editions that came from the
[1:15:45] Greek. Over time, English translations
[1:15:47] didn't follow Tendale's directions on
[1:15:49] those. But the book of common prayer
[1:15:51] kept it that way. And every service
[1:15:53] across the Church of England, that's
[1:15:55] what people said. And that is what was
[1:15:59] repeated and that's how it stuck. As
[1:16:02] this as time went on, the influence of
[1:16:05] the book of common prayer was felt in
[1:16:06] other denominations. Churches that made
[1:16:09] use of formal liturgy like um likely to
[1:16:12] say trespasses, Anglican, Methodist,
[1:16:14] Catholic, Lutheran, Eastern Orthodox,
[1:16:16] while churches that don't use the same
[1:16:19] kind of formal liturgy are more likely
[1:16:23] to say debt debts, which is Presbyterian
[1:16:26] Reformed Baptist. So if you read the
[1:16:29] Lord's prayer, forgive us of our um it
[1:16:33] very plainly says forgive us of our
[1:16:35] debts as we forgive our debtors. Now I
[1:16:37] don't think it's that important
[1:16:40] because
[1:16:42] the very next verse
[1:16:45] Jesus says he says um this in Matthew
[1:16:50] chapter 6
[1:16:53] he says when thou prayest let's see he
[1:16:55] says for he says but if anyways he ends
[1:16:59] the prayer and then he says the very
[1:17:01] next verse he says forgive us of our
[1:17:03] trespasses that we forgive those who
[1:17:04] trespass against us. So let's get into
[1:17:06] the Lord's prayer here in just a few
[1:17:09] minutes we will we will finish the
[1:17:12] Lord's prayer and if we really pray this
[1:17:14] friends then I believe that we will come
[1:17:17] into that unity that I was talking
[1:17:19] about. Matthew chapter 6 verse 5 and
[1:17:22] when thou prayest thou should not be as
[1:17:25] the hypocrites are for they love to pray
[1:17:27] standing in the synagogues and in the
[1:17:29] corner of the streets that they may be
[1:17:31] seen of men. Verily I say unto you, they
[1:17:34] have their reward. But thou, when thou
[1:17:36] prayest, enter into the closet, and when
[1:17:38] thou hast shut up the door, pray to the
[1:17:41] Father which is in secret, and thy
[1:17:43] father which seeth in secret shall
[1:17:45] reward thee openly. So if you really
[1:17:47] want to make a difference in someone's
[1:17:48] life,
[1:17:50] don't let anyone know what you're doing.
[1:17:53] Go in secret. Do your arms in secret. As
[1:17:55] Jesus said, do your prayers in secret.
[1:17:57] And this whole concept of prayer is
[1:18:00] setting aside your own self-serving
[1:18:03] motives and then entering into the mind
[1:18:06] of God.
[1:18:08] You want to I don't have time but Romans
[1:18:10] chapter 8 tells us that likewise the
[1:18:13] spirit also helps our infirmities. For
[1:18:14] we know not what we should pray for as
[1:18:16] we ought, but the spirit itself makes
[1:18:18] intercessions for us with groanings
[1:18:20] which cannot be uttered.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; So we get in those quiet places and we
[1:18:24] pray.
[1:18:26] But when you pray, use not vain
[1:18:29] repetitions as the heathen do, for they
[1:18:31] think that they shall be heard for their
[1:18:34] much speaking. Be not therefore like
[1:18:36] them. For your father knoweth what
[1:18:38] things you have need of before you ask
[1:18:40] him,
[1:18:43] and after this manner, therefore pray.
[1:18:46] Okay, now we're getting into the Lord's
[1:18:48] prayer. Jesus talking to his disciples.
[1:18:51] Our father which hath art in heaven,
[1:18:54] hallowed be thy name.
[1:18:56] Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in
[1:18:59] earth as it is in heaven. So first he is
[1:19:02] giving God respect. He's approaching him
[1:19:03] in a respectful way with reverence and
[1:19:06] humility.
[1:19:09] And then he's he's teaching us to
[1:19:13] approach God in this way. We're lifting
[1:19:16] up God in worship. The prayer the the
[1:19:18] prayer the the Lord's prayer opens up in
[1:19:21] worship and it closes in worship.
[1:19:24] And it says this, "Now that we have
[1:19:27] approached God in the right way, holy
[1:19:30] and reverent, give us this day our daily
[1:19:34] bread." Now we present our need to God
[1:19:37] after we have worshiped him. Lord, I
[1:19:39] have a need. I'm having trouble at my
[1:19:41] job. I'm I'm having spiritual trouble.
[1:19:43] Lord, I need a touch from you. Remember
[1:19:46] Christ's prayer for unity in the church.
[1:19:49] And that's how he taught us to pray. We
[1:19:52] pray for these things that we
[1:19:53] desperately need need and forgive us of
[1:19:56] our debts as we forgive our debtors.
[1:20:00] So you say, "Lord, I understand
[1:20:03] that my dependence on your forgiveness
[1:20:08] is dependent on me forgiving others."
[1:20:14] So when we pray that way, we're
[1:20:17] reminding ourselves, Lord, I forgive
[1:20:22] someone who has done something against
[1:20:24] me. And now, Lord, I place this into
[1:20:28] your hands. I don't require an apology.
[1:20:30] I don't require any of this. I forgive
[1:20:33] their debts. I And someone when someone
[1:20:35] does you wrong, they incur a debt to
[1:20:38] you. And if you can forgive that debt of
[1:20:41] that person, then now you are where God
[1:20:44] wants you. Lord, I forgive them for what
[1:20:47] they have done. And forgive us of our
[1:20:49] debts as we forgive our debtors. And
[1:20:51] lead us not into temptation, but deliver
[1:20:53] us from evil. For thine is the kingdom
[1:20:55] and the power and the glory forever.
[1:20:58] Amen. And lead us not into temptation.
[1:21:01] Lord, before we sin, help us avoid sin
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; as we walk through life. Let us lead us
[1:21:07] away from the temptation of sin. Don't
[1:21:09] allow yourself to be placed in that
[1:21:12] position of sin.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; It doesn't say lead us not into sin.
[1:21:18] It says lead us not into temptation.
[1:21:21] If gossip is a temptation, maybe
[1:21:24] criticizing the sermon after church or
[1:21:26] talking about different people, then
[1:21:27] don't allow yourself to be placed in
[1:21:30] that situation. Don't go to lunch with
[1:21:32] the people that constantly speak
[1:21:34] negative words and draw you down. Lead
[1:21:37] us not into temptation. Don't put
[1:21:38] yourself in that spot. If you have a
[1:21:40] problem drinking, then don't walk into a
[1:21:43] situation that would teach that would
[1:21:44] tempt you to drink.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; If you have a weakness of inappropriate
[1:21:48] sexual desires, don't let yourself be in
[1:21:51] a position of being alone with someone
[1:21:53] of the opposite sex. Don't go into
[1:21:55] temptation. The sin is after temptation.
[1:21:59] If you have a weakness of looking at
[1:22:01] things on the internet, don't put
[1:22:02] yourself in the position of of having to
[1:22:05] overcome something.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; It's temptation. It's not sin. Lord,
[1:22:10] keep us away from the temptation. Don't
[1:22:12] let me go there because I might fall.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Keep yourself away from the the
[1:22:18] temptation, the very appearance of evil.
[1:22:20] Stay away from it.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; And lead us not into temptation, but
[1:22:25] deliver us from evil.
[1:22:28] deliver us from evil. When we find
[1:22:30] ourselves now in a place that we
[1:22:32] shouldn't be, when we find ourselves in
[1:22:34] a situation where we need God to get us
[1:22:36] out, we cry, "God, God, deliver me from
[1:22:38] this evil. Get me out of this."
[1:22:42] Now Jesus closes in worship again and
[1:22:45] lead us not into tempt unto temptation,
[1:22:47] but deliver us from evil. For thine is
[1:22:49] the kingdom.
[1:22:51] Now he's worshiping again. For Lord,
[1:22:54] yours is the kingdom and yours is the
[1:22:57] power and yours is the glory forever.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. The worship team can come. And
[1:23:05] then he goes right into this. And this
[1:23:07] is William Tenddale. For if you forgive
[1:23:11] men their trespasses, your heavenly
[1:23:12] father will also forgive you. Right into
[1:23:14] that. Right after the Lord's prayer,
[1:23:17] Jesus thought it was important enough to
[1:23:19] say, "If you forgive men their
[1:23:22] trespasses, your father will also
[1:23:23] forgive you. But if you forgive them not
[1:23:25] of their trespasses, neither will you,
[1:23:27] your father, forgive your trespasses."
[1:23:31] Luke closes
[1:23:34] his prayer
[1:23:36] in this way. The um the gospel of Luke
[1:23:40] says the Lord's prayer like this. He
[1:23:42] says, "And I say unto you," after the
[1:23:44] Lord's prayer is over, Matthew ends with
[1:23:48] Jesus saying, "For forgive them of their
[1:23:51] trespasses." Luke says this, "And I say
[1:23:53] unto you, ask and it shall be given to
[1:23:55] you." After he gives a parable, Jesus
[1:23:58] says, "Ask and it shall be given to you.
[1:24:01] Seek and ye shall find. Knock and it
[1:24:02] shall be open to you. For everyone that
[1:24:04] askketh receiveth, and he that seeketh
[1:24:06] findeth, and to him that knockketh it
[1:24:09] shall be opened.
[1:24:11] So Jesus is encouraging us. Pray this
[1:24:14] Lord's prayer. You start your prayer.
[1:24:16] Our father who art in heaven. Hallowed
[1:24:18] be thy name. You start you get down on
[1:24:21] your knees or you stand with your face
[1:24:23] against the wall or what wherever you
[1:24:26] are. Lord, you are God. You are mighty.
[1:24:28] You are wonderful. Lord, I thank you
[1:24:30] that you created the heavens and the
[1:24:32] earth. I thank you that you placed me
[1:24:33] here. And Lord, I have now Lord I have
[1:24:35] this weakness.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come,
[1:24:40] thy will be done on earth as it is in
[1:24:42] heaven. Now Lord, I have a need. I have
[1:24:44] a weakness or I have a need for money or
[1:24:46] I have a need for something. Give us
[1:24:47] this day our daily bread
[1:24:50] and forgive forgive us of our debts as
[1:24:53] we forgive those we forgive our debtors.
[1:24:57] We've incurred this. Lord, I I've I've
[1:25:00] done wrong and and I've had problems.
[1:25:02] Now I need you. And Lord, I forgive
[1:25:04] others. Now, Lord, I've done my part.
[1:25:06] Now I place it into your hands. Lord,
[1:25:08] help me.
[1:25:13] and lead us not into temptation.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; One of the keys, one of the things that
[1:25:19] we always we we just maybe read over
[1:25:21] that, Lord, don't let me fall into
[1:25:24] temptation. If walking into the grocery
[1:25:27] store and seeing maybe the alcohol there
[1:25:29] is a temptation, Lord, I want to stay
[1:25:31] away from that. If turning on the
[1:25:32] computer when I I I'm have idle time or
[1:25:36] getting on my phone when I have idle
[1:25:37] time. Lord, I I just don't I want to
[1:25:39] stay away from that temptation. Or if if
[1:25:41] your your wife says something to you or
[1:25:43] or your husband says something to you
[1:25:45] and it just it irks you, Lord, I don't I
[1:25:48] don't want to go there. I'm just going
[1:25:49] to I'm going to humble myself. And then
[1:25:52] you see that the peace of God is there.
[1:25:56] Lord, she owes me an apology. No,
[1:26:00] nobody owes anybody an apology if you're
[1:26:03] a Christian.
[1:26:05] If you're not a Christian, maybe you
[1:26:07] would think somebody owes you an
[1:26:08] apology. But if you are a Christian,
[1:26:10] according to the Lord's prayer and
[1:26:12] according to the Lord's prayer for
[1:26:13] unity, nobody owes you an apology.
[1:26:16] Because if they do, and if you want it,
[1:26:18] then you're not a Christian according to
[1:26:20] these words. And lead us not into
[1:26:23] temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[1:26:28] Now, Lord, I have a need.
[1:26:32] I place it into your hands.
[1:26:35] by your word, by your son, Jesus Christ,
[1:26:38] I place it into your hands. For yours is
[1:26:40] the kingdom and Lord, yours is the power
[1:26:44] and Lord, yours is the glory
[1:26:48] forever.
[1:26:51] Amen. Imagine, friends, if we prayed
[1:26:54] that prayer.
[1:26:57] Doesn't have to be those exact words,
[1:26:59] but imagine if we prayed like that. And
[1:27:02] then imagine if we prayed like Jesus did
[1:27:04] before he went to the cross. Lord, may
[1:27:06] they be one as as we are one. It wasn't
[1:27:09] all these doctrines. It wasn't all these
[1:27:11] different churches. Jesus is like,
[1:27:12] listen, all of that that's not that's
[1:27:15] not what matters. What matters is that
[1:27:17] you are one. And then if you are one and
[1:27:19] you love each other, then the whole
[1:27:21] world will see that we are Christians
[1:27:23] and they will want to be like you. But
[1:27:25] instead, people don't want to be like
[1:27:26] Christians today.
[1:27:29] shouldn't be that.
[1:27:32] They should want to be a Christian.
[1:27:35] And we should always
[1:27:38] represent ourselves
[1:27:40] as Jesus Christ. We should always
[1:27:42] represent ourselves as followers of him.
[1:27:45] If it's, as I said, if it's been to your
[1:27:47] wife or to your husband, to your
[1:27:49] daughter, to your son, to your parents,
[1:27:51] whatever it is, represent yourself as a
[1:27:53] Christian. And then just your testimony,
[1:27:56] just your actions will speak way more
[1:27:59] than all of the words in the world.
[1:28:02] They would see, I want to be like that
[1:28:04] guy.
[1:28:07] That's who I want to be like. He's a
[1:28:08] Christian. That's what a Christian is. I
[1:28:11] want to be like that. But you see over
[1:28:14] here, that's what a Christian is. I
[1:28:17] don't want it. I like Jesus, but I don't
[1:28:19] want Christianity.
[1:28:22] But there is coming a time Jesus Christ
[1:28:25] himself, God in flesh on earth prayed
[1:28:29] for unity and it's coming.
[1:28:33] Friends, do you want to be part of it?
[1:28:35] If you want to be part of it, then you
[1:28:38] handle the part that surrounds you.
[1:28:41] I'll handle the part that surrounds me.
[1:28:45] And then this will grow. It's like
[1:28:46] taking a stone and throwing it in a calm
[1:28:49] pond. and watch those ripples. They
[1:28:52] would just go and go and go and they go
[1:28:54] on forever. And if we can truly just
[1:28:57] start
[1:28:59] with our lives,
[1:29:01] start with our family, start right
[1:29:03] there. And then you watch how it
[1:29:05] spreads. That's what's going to happen.
[1:29:09] That's what's going to happen. Then
[1:29:10] Jesus Christ will return when that unity
[1:29:14] is truly there because there is power in
[1:29:16] unity.
[1:29:18] And friends, I want to be part of it
[1:29:23] so bad with all my heart. And the only
[1:29:27] unity that we can have is through Jesus
[1:29:29] Christ, our Lord, our Savior. And not
[1:29:33] from all the doctrines may be right.
[1:29:36] Not saying the doctrines are wrong. They
[1:29:37] may be right, but when they separate
[1:29:38] you, you've used them in the wrong way.
[1:29:42] I have decided
[1:29:44] to follow Jesus. Before we get on this
[1:29:47] song,
[1:29:50] told this testimony before,
[1:29:54] there was a great revival going on in
[1:29:56] Europe about 150 years ago.
[1:30:01] The revival
[1:30:02] like all of us when the joy comes in our
[1:30:05] heart, you know that Jesus prayed that
[1:30:07] the joy would be there. When when it
[1:30:09] comes in, we want to spread it to other
[1:30:11] people. We want to spread it to other
[1:30:13] places. And this revival started in
[1:30:15] Europe. And these these people had given
[1:30:19] their hearts to the Lord Jesus. And they
[1:30:20] had just such joy and such power and
[1:30:23] such love that they wanted to bring it
[1:30:25] to other countries. And this one
[1:30:26] missionary these missionaries go to
[1:30:28] India.
[1:30:30] And they start witnessing to these
[1:30:32] different heathens in India. These were
[1:30:35] not only one of this group of
[1:30:38] missionaries came not only to
[1:30:41] the heathens and the idoltors but to
[1:30:44] cannibals
[1:30:47] people that would eat, kill and eat
[1:30:50] their enemies to
[1:30:52] finally assert that power over them.
[1:30:56] Death wasn't enough.
[1:30:58] They wanted to do that just to say how
[1:31:01] much stronger I am than you. They these
[1:31:04] missionaries came and they witnessed
[1:31:07] to this place in India
[1:31:10] and there was a man named Nak Singh
[1:31:14] who heard this witness
[1:31:17] and he believed on this man Jesus
[1:31:19] Christ. He believed on these teachings.
[1:31:21] He believed these these missionaries
[1:31:24] must have set a good example. And this
[1:31:26] man believed and his family believed on
[1:31:30] this this novel concept
[1:31:34] of Christianity and Jesus Christ.
[1:31:39] And he started witnessing around his
[1:31:41] villages. And the village elders heard
[1:31:44] this. They didn't want any of this. They
[1:31:47] were warriors. They didn't want any of
[1:31:48] this peace and unity and all that stuff.
[1:31:51] That is not what they stood for. They
[1:31:52] didn't stand to reach out to other
[1:31:55] tribes. They stood to take things from
[1:31:57] other tribes, to destroy other tribes,
[1:32:00] to make it to where these other tribes
[1:32:02] wouldn't invade them. So this man, he's
[1:32:05] witnessing about this man, Jesus Christ,
[1:32:07] and about this Christianity did not line
[1:32:09] up with what they thought. So they start
[1:32:12] telling on each other and finally he
[1:32:13] gets to the village head and he brings
[1:32:16] this man
[1:32:18] before him
[1:32:21] and he says, "What is this?
[1:32:24] What are you talking about? Would you
[1:32:26] have your village die? Would you have
[1:32:28] your village defenseless in this unity
[1:32:31] that you're talking about this love of
[1:32:32] Jesus Christ? Would you want your
[1:32:34] village to perish in that when these
[1:32:36] other people would these other villages
[1:32:38] would attack us?
[1:32:41] He brought before the chief and the man
[1:32:43] said, "I have decided
[1:32:45] to follow Jesus."
[1:32:48] He says, "You're forsaking everything
[1:32:49] that you've ever learned."
[1:32:53] And he said, "The world behind me
[1:32:56] and the cross before me."
[1:32:59] He said, "No turning back."
[1:33:03] So he took this man No Singh.
[1:33:07] He took his two young boys and they set
[1:33:10] his two young boys before him and he had
[1:33:14] the archers pull their bow back and he
[1:33:16] said the village master said, "Okay,
[1:33:19] Noxine, does it mean enough to you to
[1:33:22] lose your boys?
[1:33:26] Will you recant from this nonsense?"
[1:33:29] He says, "Though none go with me,
[1:33:34] still I will follow." No turning back.
[1:33:37] They let the arrows go and killed his
[1:33:39] two sons.
[1:33:44] They brought up his wife. He said, "Nox
[1:33:46] singing, will you recant?"
[1:33:49] And he says this. He says, "My cross
[1:33:51] I'll carry till I see Jesus. No turning
[1:33:54] back." And they killed his wife.
[1:33:57] before he died,
[1:34:00] he looked at the chief and he said,
[1:34:04] "Will you decide now to follow Jesus?"
[1:34:08] No turning back. And they killed him.
[1:34:12] years later, decades later, a group of
[1:34:15] other missionaries came to the same area
[1:34:18] and Knox Singh's testimony resonated not
[1:34:22] only with the people that watched his
[1:34:24] his family die, be executed, but it
[1:34:26] resonated with the very vi village elder
[1:34:29] and the whole village gave their hearts
[1:34:31] to Jesus Christ and became Christians.
[1:34:33] And when this other group of
[1:34:35] missionaries came, they said, "Oh, we
[1:34:37] already know Jesus." And they told this
[1:34:39] story of this song that we're about to
[1:34:41] sing.
[1:34:44] I have decided to follow Jesus. It
[1:34:46] builds unity, friends, and it builds
[1:34:49] love. It is more important than any kind
[1:34:51] of little stuff that separates a husband
[1:34:53] from a wife. Any type of little stuff
[1:34:55] that separates a church from another
[1:34:57] church. It's beyond anything in the
[1:35:00] world. And it's what Jesus prayed for.
[1:35:02] Listen to this song. Let's all sing it
[1:35:04] together.
[1:35:07] I have decided
[1:35:12] [Music]
[1:35:13] to follow
[1:35:16] Jesus.
[1:35:20] I have decided
[1:35:26] to follow
[1:35:28] Jesus.
[1:35:33] I have decided
[1:35:39] to follow
[1:35:41] Jesus.
[1:35:45] No turning back.
[1:35:49] [Music]
[1:35:52] No turning back.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Imagine that man standing there. He
[1:35:57] says, "I've decided to follow Jesus. I
[1:35:59] will not go back." decided
[1:36:04] to follow Jesus.
[1:36:10] [Music]
[1:36:11] I have decided
[1:36:17] to follow
[1:36:19] Jesus.
[1:36:23] I have decided
[1:36:29] to follow
[1:36:31] Jesus.
[1:36:32] [Music]
[1:36:35] No turning back.
[1:36:41] No turning back.
[1:36:47] The world behind
[1:36:51] me,
[1:36:53] the cross before
[1:36:56] me,
[1:36:59] the world behind
[1:37:02] me,
[1:37:04] the cross before
[1:37:08] me,
[1:37:10] the world behind
[1:37:14] me,
[1:37:16] the cross before
[1:37:19] me.
[1:37:22] I won't turn back.
[1:37:27] I won't turn back.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Can you say the same thing?
[1:37:33] The world behind me and the cross before
[1:37:36] me, I'm not turning back.
[1:37:39] I'm not turning back to my old worldly
[1:37:40] ways. I want a change in my life.
[1:37:43] And this change, it's it's everything to
[1:37:47] me. That world
[1:37:50] may be
[1:37:53] addiction. It may be whatever it may be.
[1:37:55] Or it may be a religious spirit. But
[1:37:57] Lord, I set that world behind me.
[1:38:01] And I set the cross before me. And no,
[1:38:06] Lord, I will not turn back. I won't turn
[1:38:09] back. Though none go with me,
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; though none go with me,
[1:38:17] still I will follow.
[1:38:23] Though none go with me,
[1:38:28] still I will follow
[1:38:34] though none go with me.
[1:38:39] Still I will follow.
[1:38:43] [Music]
[1:38:45] I won't turn back.
[1:38:51] I won't.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand.
[1:38:55] Think about this.
[1:38:58] Are you willing
[1:39:00] to be a Christian? Are you willing to
[1:39:02] say, "Though none go with me." If I have
[1:39:06] to walk this walk of Christianity alone,
[1:39:09] if I have to walk by myself, though none
[1:39:13] go with me, if my parents won't go with
[1:39:15] me, if my wife won't go with me, if my
[1:39:17] husband won't go with me, if my church
[1:39:19] won't go with me, I am willing to walk
[1:39:22] this walk of Christianity alone. I am
[1:39:25] willing to do everything I can for that
[1:39:29] love and unity that Jesus Christ prayed
[1:39:32] for.
[1:39:33] And then if you do, Jesus said to take
[1:39:36] up your cross
[1:39:39] and follow me. That cross is a heavy
[1:39:41] burden.
[1:39:43] But he said it, "My cross I'll carry.
[1:39:51] My cross I'll carry
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; till I see Jesus.
[1:39:55] My cross I'll carry
[1:40:00] till I see Jesus
[1:40:06] my cross I'll carry
[1:40:10] [Music]
[1:40:12] till I see Jesus
[1:40:17] my cross I'll carry
[1:40:23] until I see Jesus.
[1:40:27] [Music]
[1:40:29] I won't turn back.
[1:40:32] [Music]
[1:40:34] I won't turn back.
[1:40:40] I have decided
[1:40:45] to follow Jesus.
[1:40:51] I have decided
[1:40:54] [Music]
[1:40:56] to follow Jesus.
[1:41:02] I have decided
[1:41:07] to follow Jesus.
[1:41:13] I won't turn back.
[1:41:19] I won't turn back.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, will you lay
[1:41:22] aside?
[1:41:24] Will you lay aside those things that so
[1:41:26] easily beset us? We lay aside th those
[1:41:30] things that separate us.
[1:41:33] And when you will you truly bow
[1:41:36] and will you truly pray along with the
[1:41:39] Lord Jesus that we would be one within
[1:41:42] our families,
[1:41:44] within our friends, within our churches,
[1:41:48] within the world, that we could be one
[1:41:51] in Jesus Christ and pick up your cross
[1:41:56] and carry that cross and follow Jesus.
[1:41:58] He prayed that we would be one.
[1:42:03] And I believe that his prayer will be
[1:42:05] answered. Let's bow our heads.
[1:42:09] Our Father,
[1:42:11] who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[1:42:15] Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in
[1:42:19] earth as it is in heaven.
[1:42:21] And give us this day our daily bread.
[1:42:25] Forgive us of our debts as we forgive
[1:42:27] our debtors.
[1:42:29] and lead us not into temptation,
[1:42:31] [Music]
[1:42:32] but deliver us from evil. For thine is
[1:42:35] the kingdom and the power and the glory
[1:42:39] forever.
[1:42:41] Lord God,
[1:42:44] I want to be a Christian. Lord,
[1:42:47] from the bottom of my heart, I want to
[1:42:50] be like that man from India who stood
[1:42:52] for you.
[1:42:54] I want to be like those disciples. Every
[1:42:56] one of them lost their life.
[1:43:00] are imprisoned. Lord, I want to be like
[1:43:02] them. I want to be able to stand for a
[1:43:04] living Jesus Christ. I want to be a I
[1:43:06] want to be able to stand for the unity
[1:43:08] of the gospel. Lord, I want to be able
[1:43:10] to stand with my brothers and sisters
[1:43:13] arm in arm who love Jesus Christ, who
[1:43:15] love you. Lord, I want to stand.
[1:43:19] Lord, give us strength to make that
[1:43:21] stand. I pray.
[1:43:23] Guide us, Father. We love you and we
[1:43:26] thank you.
[1:43:29] We ask Lord that we could be part
[1:43:33] of this great plan that you have to one
[1:43:39] day return and take away your waiting
[1:43:42] bride.
[1:43:44] Lord, may we be part of that and may we
[1:43:46] be that waiting bride when you return in
[1:43:49] Jesus name. Amen.
