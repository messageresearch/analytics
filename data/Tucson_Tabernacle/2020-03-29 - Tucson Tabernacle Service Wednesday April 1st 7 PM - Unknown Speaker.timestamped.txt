[47:10] [Music]
[47:39] [Applause]
[47:41] [Music]
[47:49] let's just bow our heads and talk to
[47:53] them as they continue to play that
[47:54] course Lord we we come this evening some
[48:00] of us gathered here at the Tabernacle
[48:02] and others gathered in their homes maybe
[48:06] some families together and I know some
[48:09] may be having to work and may be
[48:11] listening in that way to date
[48:14] you're not limited to a specific place
[48:16] or who were just in the church building
[48:18] order but you said wherever two or three
[48:21] are gathered that you'd be inadmissible
[48:23] because you would be in us so each one
[48:26] denied listening in and having a need
[48:30] and a desire Lord to hear from you and
[48:33] father maybe a question that needs to be
[48:35] answered or today a situation came up
[48:39] they're not too sure what to do about it
[48:41] Lord would you minister to each landlord
[48:44] or through the ministry of your word
[48:46] Lord even in the scene in the songs and
[48:49] the worship and all Lord made the needs
[48:52] of your children be met Lord for you
[48:54] said every need is supplied Lord we can
[48:57] go to you full believe it we'll ask we
[49:01] appreciate that Lord we just ask you to
[49:03] speak to our hearts Lord use these lips
[49:06] lord help me to set myself on the side
[49:08] and let you speak nor dead which would
[49:11] be most needful we ask you to Jesus
[49:14] Christ amen
[49:17] thank you musicians god bless you just
[49:21] an announcement to make and there were
[49:24] no prayer requests that were given
[49:26] indirectly but there was a brother that
[49:30] did send one in during the week asking
[49:32] prayer for his stepson 15 year old
[49:35] stepson who had gotten into some trouble
[49:38] and was taken to the juvenile hall or
[49:41] just remembering that situation in
[49:44] prayer and a family and I don't know
[49:46] their name I didn't get their name but
[49:48] he's a missionary to the Philippines and
[49:52] a young couple I did see the picture
[49:55] with three children and the missionary
[49:58] did contract this virus he was guarded
[50:03] and he gave it to his wife and his
[50:05] children so lord knows who that family
[50:08] is and God is a healer it's already done
[50:12] so if you do have a need and you can
[50:16] call my phone you can call the church
[50:20] you can get it if you have whatsapp you
[50:23] can send it that way again and it can be
[50:25] prayed over also if you don't have
[50:28] whatsapp or no way to or maybe not a on
[50:31] your phone you don't have a smartphone
[50:34] you can call the church number at five
[50:36] two oh six two three oh three eight one
[50:38] and that if the phone doesn't answer
[50:42] then sister Rachel Peterson it goes to
[50:44] her voicemail and someone will get back
[50:47] to you so if they can't answer it they
[50:50] will if just general questions and
[50:51] information needed that's one way to to
[50:54] find out and we'll get back to you as
[50:57] soon as possible so just trust it
[51:01] in the time like this that we can help
[51:04] one another
[51:05] I got home the other day from service
[51:08] and I mentioned to my family I haven't
[51:11] seen brother so-and-so and sister zones
[51:13] so and then it dawned on me I haven't
[51:14] seen a lot of them they haven't been
[51:16] here but just something came up and they
[51:18] kind of laughed a little bit but sure
[51:21] would be good to see the saints one more
[51:22] time and get his feed but lord knows the
[51:26] reason as to why and as we spoke into
[51:28] different folks in different parts of
[51:31] the country and everybody going through
[51:32] the same thing and going through the
[51:34] same time so but it didn't come as a
[51:37] surprise to God he didn't have to go
[51:40] back to the drawing board and say wow
[51:42] how am I gonna fix this situation as it
[51:45] come talking to one of my daughters and
[51:47] she said maybe to use this time to break
[51:51] some habits change they say habits can
[51:54] take some time to change well there may
[51:56] be time to work on it now you know some
[51:58] of the things that you said boy I sure
[51:59] would like to change this in my life I
[52:01] would like this to be different and
[52:03] maybe there's time to dedicate to those
[52:06] things and heard some folks say that God
[52:09] may have put a stop to the rush so we
[52:12] could stop slow down a little bit and
[52:14] spend some time getting getting life or
[52:18] life straightened out getting things
[52:19] that sometimes things are in a busy and
[52:22] in a hurry and it's just hard to stop
[52:24] and get some of the things done both
[52:26] natural things things with the family
[52:28] but especially spiritual things and life
[52:31] gets busy at times there's a lot of
[52:33] plans and you know you say well I'm
[52:36] planning to take some time off here and
[52:38] something comes up and you can do it but
[52:39] maybe now there will be some time and
[52:42] God still supplies all our needs just
[52:45] the different testimonies you hear how
[52:48] God has met a need and a prayer request
[52:51] and and God meets it and sometimes you
[52:54] get nervous and you get afraid and say
[52:58] one of my co-workers today and as we
[53:00] were working together in a house and I
[53:02] made a comment to him and he just
[53:03] exploded and he just just got very upset
[53:08] and didn't say anything bad to me but
[53:10] just kind of vented on me so just let
[53:13] him and and went in before I came in
[53:16] service and I set my phone down I got a
[53:18] text and
[53:18] it was him he said I'm very sorry of how
[53:21] I acted today
[53:23] and I thought well thank the Lord for
[53:25] that you know and because of the stress
[53:28] in the situation's that we go through
[53:29] sometimes we can react in ways that we
[53:34] have to just say Lord forgive me and
[53:36] maybe go ask somebody hey I'm sorry or
[53:38] tell somebody I'm sorry I didn't mean to
[53:40] do that but I read this it was sent to
[53:45] me or those of you that get the daily
[53:48] strength and this is the one that came
[53:51] in a couple of days ago and I just like
[53:52] to share with it with you and read it
[53:54] here the scripture they use is 1st Peter
[53:58] 3:18 and for Christ also has one
[54:02] suffered for sins the just for the
[54:05] unjust that he might bring us to God
[54:07] being put to death in the flesh but
[54:10] quickened by the Spirit and it was said
[54:14] it is doubtful whether God can bless a
[54:17] man greatly until he has hurt him deeply
[54:20] and that caused me to stop for a moment
[54:23] and it made me realize that said Jesus
[54:27] learn through the things he suffered and
[54:31] we would like to learn in a nice
[54:32] beautiful calm environment where
[54:35] everything is happy but sometimes you
[54:37] don't learn that way but in the time of
[54:39] need and the time of of maybe some some
[54:42] hardships it begins to teach you things
[54:45] teaches you they that wait upon the Lord
[54:47] shall renew their strength but you don't
[54:50] know if you don't have to wait this is
[54:53] especially for those who are older
[54:55] amongst us mungus those with experience
[54:59] and years under their belts they know
[55:01] what that life is full of hard knocks
[55:03] some things are extremely hard to deal
[55:06] with in this life and others are just
[55:08] perplexing bad times seem to outweigh
[55:11] the good simply because it's the bad
[55:13] times that shape us most that's the work
[55:17] where the word gives you so simply
[55:20] because it's the bad times that shape as
[55:22] the most they deeply affect us
[55:24] oftentimes in ways that we don't even
[55:26] see but do you really believe that this
[55:29] molding and changing is the tender
[55:32] and of Jehova in your life sometimes on
[55:35] this side of it looking back here saying
[55:37] wow that was God boy did I need it I
[55:40] didn't see it then I wondered why but
[55:43] thank God for it character is a victory
[55:46] and it is one through the tender hand of
[55:49] Jehovah molding and shaping the clay
[55:51] into a beautiful vessel of honor he is a
[55:54] potter and it would do us well to simply
[55:57] rest in the fact that we that when we
[56:00] can't seem to figure out why certain
[56:01] things happen some things that happen in
[56:04] our lives hurt us deeply it is the
[56:07] reaction to that hurt that shows our
[56:10] character and I just this what happened
[56:13] today and it work and he's we've worked
[56:18] together for many years and he's got a
[56:20] son that works with him now and the son
[56:24] is like 37 years old but act sometimes
[56:26] like he's 12 and when he wants to do
[56:29] good work he want he can do good work
[56:32] but he has a hard time getting out of
[56:34] bed and sometimes doesn't show up till
[56:36] noon and then a lot of issues but he
[56:39] does a good work so his father has
[56:41] gotten tired of hearing about the
[56:44] problems of this boy and and but you
[56:50] know if we always went to God and and
[56:54] just said you know Lord you need to deal
[56:56] with this problem with that person and
[56:58] you need to deal with this problem with
[56:59] that person we were always telling him
[57:00] and God would look down and say no I
[57:02] think I know where I need to deal with
[57:04] this I need to deal it with it in you
[57:07] and I've learned that by experience you
[57:09] know so you know he just he exploded he
[57:12] was that but but he sent me a text
[57:14] because I'm sorry with everything's
[57:15] going on I did I should have never done
[57:17] that to you and sometimes that's how we
[57:20] learned it's not a pleasant experience
[57:22] while we're going through it but second
[57:26] time around third time around and maybe
[57:27] for some of us five and 10 times around
[57:29] before we catch on but it's a shaping of
[57:33] our of us you know it is the character
[57:38] alone that we bring with us to the other
[57:40] side it is the Lord's prerogative to
[57:43] make sure his people have the
[57:46] fit to ring with him and character is a
[57:51] victory
[57:52] to overcome means that you've had a
[57:55] battle you had to overcome something
[57:57] Christ suffered for us since we suffer
[58:00] with him in this life don't forget that
[58:02] the fact that Christ paid the penalty
[58:04] for a wrongdoing it's it's a fact he
[58:08] says so what situation or what
[58:10] circumstance could ever darken the fact
[58:13] that crisis on the throne and it is to
[58:15] his side that we will one day go nothing
[58:19] will keep us from that it says don't let
[58:22] yourself forget that God allows us to
[58:24] wait to hurt to experience trouble all
[58:27] for our good trust in Him lean not to
[58:31] your own understanding and you know
[58:34] sometimes as as a parent or maybe a an
[58:38] elder sibling or older brother and
[58:41] sister who's already been through some
[58:42] of the situation's and teaching a
[58:44] younger sibling or a child or somebody
[58:46] that hey I've been there before
[58:48] don't do that don't get cut off in that
[58:51] you know and maybe that child or that
[58:53] younger princess and I've heard it this
[58:55] way well I need to learn on my own well
[58:59] there's some things that hey I could
[59:01] take some some good advice from somebody
[59:03] and go that way because they've been
[59:04] there and so if you wonder what's good
[59:08] advice open the scriptures and I'd like
[59:12] to start with revelations chapter 1
[59:15] verses 3 and then 17 and 19 and want to
[59:19] continue back into his series that we
[59:22] were speaking on a relationship but the
[59:25] thought came with reading between the
[59:27] lines and I know there's a lot of things
[59:31] that could be said about reading between
[59:32] the lines but they have a certain way
[59:34] that I'd like to go so the scripture
[59:37] tell is blessed is he that readeth and
[59:39] they that hear the words of this
[59:41] prophecy and keep those things which are
[59:44] written therein for the time is at hand
[59:47] you know there there comes a time in a
[59:50] day when this is fulfilled every age
[59:54] look I said it's this day it's this day
[59:56] it's a this day but it's closer now than
[59:58] it's ever been
[59:59] I just like to read this translation of
[1:00:01] it blessed is he who reads and blessed
[1:00:04] are those who listened to the words of
[1:00:06] the prophecy and lay to heart what is
[1:00:09] written in it for the time before his
[1:00:11] fulfillment is now close at hand it's
[1:00:14] one thing to listen to it it's another
[1:00:16] name to take it at heart and put it into
[1:00:19] action so and in verses 17 and 19 and I
[1:00:24] don't know that we'll get through all of
[1:00:26] this it's a lot but maybe over a couple
[1:00:29] of Wednesday nights Lord willing and
[1:00:30] then John here in that same chapter 1 he
[1:00:33] says and when I saw him verses 17
[1:00:35] through 19 and when I saw him I fell at
[1:00:37] his feet as dead and he laid his right
[1:00:40] hand upon me saying unto me fear not I
[1:00:43] am the first and the last I am he that
[1:00:46] liveth and was dead and behold I am
[1:00:49] Alive for evermore amen and have the
[1:00:53] keys of hell and of death so what why do
[1:00:57] we fear he's got it in his hands it's
[1:01:00] under his control and he tells John
[1:01:02] write the things which thou has seen and
[1:01:04] the things which are and the things
[1:01:06] which shall be Hereafter
[1:01:08] and we just read verse 3 it says blessed
[1:01:10] are they who listen read and pay
[1:01:13] attention to the things that are written
[1:01:14] so if we take what God's Word says and
[1:01:17] we see what it is and we let him reveal
[1:01:20] it to us not make up our own ideas of
[1:01:23] what it is but let the Holy Spirit
[1:01:25] reveal it to us then we don't have to
[1:01:27] fear God has his hand in all things and
[1:01:30] in this thought of reading between the
[1:01:33] lines I as I was listening to brother
[1:01:38] Matz the Bible study and I had some
[1:01:42] written some thoughts down and they had
[1:01:45] archived it since I could elicit during
[1:01:47] the day while I was working and so it
[1:01:49] just kind of says he's talking about
[1:01:51] some things that just kind of fed a
[1:01:52] little more into this and and I was a
[1:01:55] God chance to speak to brother Matt for
[1:01:57] a little while and we were talking about
[1:01:59] the time you know and realize that when
[1:02:03] God addresses the church ages - each age
[1:02:06] you can go back and read it I went back
[1:02:07] through and just refreshed each church
[1:02:09] age he praised them for something he
[1:02:13] said you
[1:02:13] still handstand on this you still do
[1:02:15] this but I have somewhat against you I
[1:02:17] have this and he began to and to each
[1:02:20] overcomer for that age he gave a promise
[1:02:23] to the overcomer in this age this is
[1:02:26] this is your what you overcome this is
[1:02:29] what you receive isn't but when you get
[1:02:31] too loud Asiya this age the one that we
[1:02:34] were born and raised into and and I
[1:02:37] believe coming to the very end of it now
[1:02:40] he doesn't say very much good about it
[1:02:44] in fact he immediately begins to tell
[1:02:46] him your situation is bad but as I
[1:02:49] speaking to brother man I said but
[1:02:51] remind us let's be reminded so let's
[1:02:53] look at that revelations 3-2 to 22 and
[1:02:57] we use this once before but I like to go
[1:03:00] behold I stand at the door and knock If
[1:03:03] any man hear my voice and open the door
[1:03:05] I will come in some in to him and will
[1:03:08] sup with him and he with me here he is
[1:03:11] he's talking he says you have this
[1:03:13] problem you have this you're you know
[1:03:15] you're you've your failed in this you're
[1:03:17] you you know you say you're rich and you
[1:03:20] you're not rich you're blind in the end
[1:03:22] he's is really hard on loud Asiya
[1:03:24] because that's how loud you see is this
[1:03:26] today but he says but I still knock the
[1:03:30] door he said I didn't turn my back and
[1:03:33] walk over right away from you and leave
[1:03:35] you hopeless leave you helpless leave
[1:03:37] you in your own he says I'll knock on
[1:03:39] the door of your heart still and I will
[1:03:41] sup with you and come in and share with
[1:03:44] you if you let me and he says to him
[1:03:48] that overcometh will I grant to sit with
[1:03:50] me in my throne out of this age the age
[1:03:54] that he hit hardest to that one I will
[1:03:57] grant to sit with me in my throne even
[1:03:59] as I also overcame what it means does
[1:04:02] that mean he battled and went through it
[1:04:05] also to overcome you have to go battle
[1:04:07] you have to fight it wasn't just handed
[1:04:08] to him like I saved a silver spoon or
[1:04:11] golden spoon no there was a battle there
[1:04:13] was there was things that God had to
[1:04:15] face through in tabernacled in a body
[1:04:17] and he says even as I also overcame and
[1:04:21] sat down with my father in his throne
[1:04:23] and then it says he that hath an ear
[1:04:26] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[1:04:28] the churches and so I just want to open
[1:04:31] it with that just again reminding we are
[1:04:33] blessed to read to know in to place
[1:04:35] keep in our hearts the thing God has
[1:04:37] said because that's what encourages us
[1:04:40] you know you get a phone call maybe a
[1:04:43] letter maybe in today's a text or
[1:04:46] something like that and sometimes
[1:04:48] yesterday I think it was yesterday
[1:04:50] morning or I believe yeah I opened up my
[1:04:54] gmail account and checked to see because
[1:04:56] we get information that way or work
[1:04:59] updates and things like that and a
[1:05:01] brother said hey bruh there and just
[1:05:02] thinking about you and your family
[1:05:03] praying for you what a blessing to wake
[1:05:07] up in the morning you see they whoa
[1:05:09] somebody's thinking about me and my
[1:05:11] family and said we just prayed for you
[1:05:13] my family prayed for you I said Lord
[1:05:16] thank you because that's how you work
[1:05:18] with your family and it's just a thing
[1:05:20] to realize that that he watches over us
[1:05:23] and he cares for us there so in looking
[1:05:26] at this and again I said reading between
[1:05:30] the lines and I thought as I thought on
[1:05:34] that subject his brother branham it says
[1:05:36] it quite often reading between the lines
[1:05:38] so I pulled up all the quotes and just
[1:05:41] seeing what they think most of them were
[1:05:44] talking about when he would be out of
[1:05:46] town or in another country and sister
[1:05:49] Branham would write him a letter and he
[1:05:51] would respond and he would say you know
[1:05:53] honey I just can hardly wait till I get
[1:05:55] home and she would say you know little
[1:05:58] Joseph for this and she goes but I can
[1:06:00] read between the lines I could tell I
[1:06:02] could read in there what she's really
[1:06:04] trying to say we're both telling their
[1:06:06] each other how much we miss each other
[1:06:08] how much we love each other we're
[1:06:09] praying for one another
[1:06:11] and and as I was looking at this reading
[1:06:14] between the lines God's Word is a love
[1:06:17] story and this is where this came to
[1:06:20] it's his love to us yet some people look
[1:06:24] at as condemnation as harshness as Boyd
[1:06:28] the requirements to live this are
[1:06:30] impossible but you and I can read
[1:06:33] between the lines and see God is telling
[1:06:35] me he loves me God is telling me he
[1:06:39] cares for me
[1:06:40] God said look not only do III require
[1:06:44] this of you but I'll do it in you when
[1:06:47] he talks to his disciples and he says
[1:06:49] there's a better way I'm gonna go away
[1:06:52] and they say Oh Lord don't leave us he's
[1:06:53] to know there's a better way there's
[1:06:55] something that there's a reason for this
[1:06:57] and why but he says I could be here with
[1:07:00] you every day of your life but unless
[1:07:03] I'm in you that's all it is I'm just
[1:07:06] around you just with you and I love him
[1:07:08] when he's around but it's greater when
[1:07:10] he's inside so reading between the lines
[1:07:13] not your own interpretation or personal
[1:07:19] thoughts it's not well it because look
[1:07:24] God's Word is a level of letter to his
[1:07:27] bride and it's a many membered body but
[1:07:32] she's one bride she's not brides
[1:07:34] different brides scattered all around
[1:07:36] just like that that young man from the
[1:07:38] meat market in Chicago who came and he
[1:07:41] found that that the character in that in
[1:07:44] that young lady he said it was that one
[1:07:47] that he came back for even though
[1:07:50] brother Branham in this story talks
[1:07:51] about all of her cousins and those
[1:07:54] around him they were all around her but
[1:07:56] - that one was his promise now is it
[1:08:00] just a Tucson Tabernacle no it's to
[1:08:03] everyone that's part of Christ part of
[1:08:05] that right it's it's so it's not our own
[1:08:08] personal thoughts and not our own
[1:08:09] personal interpretation it's the Holy
[1:08:12] Spirit making it real and you know what
[1:08:14] it'll produce a true Christian and it's
[1:08:22] it's but it becomes that thought becomes
[1:08:24] a personal relationship between you in
[1:08:27] Christ and it you know it's in its again
[1:08:30] it's it's for those of us who are
[1:08:33] married and and have family and all and
[1:08:36] anything's that it's a it's a
[1:08:38] relationship that we can really look
[1:08:40] closely at because in the natural you
[1:08:42] know
[1:08:43] and even those that are are not married
[1:08:45] but part of a family you can see how
[1:08:47] that works
[1:08:48] within your siblings within your parents
[1:08:51] you know it's still a real
[1:08:54] and in speaking with brother Matt and he
[1:08:57] just made a comment back to me and I was
[1:09:00] getting ready to say it but he beat me
[1:09:01] too and he said but that reading between
[1:09:04] the lines never gets out of the Word of
[1:09:07] God
[1:09:08] it has to run in continuity with the
[1:09:11] Word of God it's not special revelations
[1:09:14] out there it's not I remember I believe
[1:09:16] it was brother green one day that was
[1:09:18] ministering and he had made this comment
[1:09:20] how he had been talking to a brother who
[1:09:23] was talking about the deep revelations
[1:09:25] that this Minister preached so brother
[1:09:28] green asked him and he said well tell me
[1:09:30] about it and the brother turn it's so
[1:09:32] deep I can't even explain it to you well
[1:09:36] it's like having a glass of something to
[1:09:39] drink and it's so good it's delish I can
[1:09:41] recommend it to it have you tasted it no
[1:09:43] I haven't you know you should be a
[1:09:47] partaker of it too then you can really
[1:09:50] recommend it and and then remember he
[1:09:54] tells Peter blessed art thou simon peter
[1:09:57] sorry minbari jonah he said my father
[1:09:59] has revealed this to you it's not
[1:10:02] something that you learned on your own
[1:10:04] is not something that that that how did
[1:10:07] that you work to get but God gives it to
[1:10:10] you and it matches his word
[1:10:12] because it's his word that will not
[1:10:15] return void so and you think about that
[1:10:18] that relationship the the the building
[1:10:22] of our relationship the experiences in
[1:10:24] life in looks both ways you know I can
[1:10:27] look back as as we're growing up and
[1:10:30] things around mom and dad or things with
[1:10:33] my older brother and older sister and a
[1:10:35] younger brother and I laugh about it
[1:10:37] sometimes now and I forget who I was
[1:10:40] talking to and had a 13 year old son and
[1:10:44] they were talking about the problem the
[1:10:46] 13 year old son was having with a 17
[1:10:49] year old son because now the 13 year old
[1:10:52] is beginning to express himself and in
[1:10:55] all and it reminded me when I turned 13
[1:10:58] I thought suddenly I was big and tough
[1:11:00] and just be honest about it I thought I
[1:11:02] could beat up my older brother and it
[1:11:05] took about five weapons before I learned
[1:11:07] just
[1:11:07] I was 13 I couldn't beat him up he got a
[1:11:11] little frustrated with me because he
[1:11:13] said I keep having to knock you down in
[1:11:14] the ground and you keep getting back up
[1:11:15] when are you gonna learn you're not
[1:11:17] you're not stronger cuz your turn turn
[1:11:18] 13 but down the road as experiences in
[1:11:22] life and we laugh about those things but
[1:11:24] we can see the lesson in it things we've
[1:11:26] experienced by life things we have
[1:11:28] learned you know hey last time I did
[1:11:31] this and it hurt I'm gonna do a little
[1:11:33] bit different this time you know just
[1:11:35] things that we learn in like the
[1:11:36] personal experiences in our life is this
[1:11:42] remember even even God Jesus is speaking
[1:11:46] to his disciples before he leaves and
[1:11:50] he's talking to them and he's telling
[1:11:52] them look I'm sharing with you things
[1:11:55] these things must come to pass I must
[1:11:58] suffer
[1:11:58] I must go through this I must you know
[1:12:01] he's talking to him about this
[1:12:02] and yet when it started to help me there
[1:12:05] tell him don't do it don't do it don't
[1:12:07] do it
[1:12:07] Oh Lord no but he had already but he
[1:12:12] says remember these things that I shared
[1:12:14] with you they will come back to your
[1:12:16] memory they will be brought back to your
[1:12:18] remembrance and you can see oh that's
[1:12:20] what it was that's what he meant now
[1:12:24] brother Brown would say now you're
[1:12:25] reading between the lines you're
[1:12:27] beginning to see but it's the
[1:12:28] fulfillment of the scripture it's not
[1:12:30] something way out there you know and you
[1:12:35] know just just some thoughts as we get
[1:12:36] started into this here what builds a
[1:12:42] relationship the things you go through
[1:12:46] the things you experienced the daily
[1:12:49] things both good and bad both hard and
[1:12:51] easy
[1:12:52] you know those bring up even even the
[1:12:56] repetition at work you know and when
[1:12:59] when you do the same thing over and over
[1:13:01] you learn skill sometimes they get
[1:13:02] monotonous but somebody watching you
[1:13:05] because you've done it a hundred times
[1:13:07] and you know how to do they go man you
[1:13:08] make it look so easy
[1:13:10] but if they seen you do it the first
[1:13:12] time they ought to go I'm not doing it
[1:13:15] that way
[1:13:15] but you've learned you've experienced it
[1:13:18] I remember that one time at work and
[1:13:21] and the guys had left and I stayed late
[1:13:25] to finish a job that needed to be done
[1:13:27] in the morning for the morning and when
[1:13:29] they came in the morning said you did
[1:13:31] that all by yourself
[1:13:32] I said yeah he goes well how why is it
[1:13:34] because I've been doing this for about
[1:13:35] 15 years now and I know how to do it but
[1:13:40] it had been 15 years ago I would have
[1:13:41] left with you guys in the morning but I
[1:13:43] know this it's part of of what you've
[1:13:45] learned as life has gone on it's a daily
[1:13:48] thing that we go through and it's that's
[1:13:54] how we learn that's how we get our
[1:13:56] experiences that's how we grow that's
[1:13:58] how our faith grows you know he's never
[1:14:02] failed me he's met me he's coming and it
[1:14:06] gets stronger Lord you've never failed I
[1:14:08] know I can trust you because I've looked
[1:14:10] back in my life that was you that was
[1:14:14] you that was you and you've never left
[1:14:16] me sometimes I wondered where you were
[1:14:19] but you were there and therefore I know
[1:14:21] that I can trust you talking to a one of
[1:14:24] the co-workers today one of the guys
[1:14:25] that out on the jobsite and we both came
[1:14:28] to the same conclusion as we were
[1:14:30] talking a little bit you know as work is
[1:14:32] slowed down people are being laid off
[1:14:33] and one of the guys told me he says I'm
[1:14:36] gonna keep working but they're gonna cut
[1:14:37] my salary and you know all those things
[1:14:39] and we're talking and the heater on he
[1:14:41] goes but you know what we just got to
[1:14:43] trust in the Lord amen that's right
[1:14:47] we just trust in him does that mean I'm
[1:14:50] not gonna go through a hard time I'm not
[1:14:51] no we trust in him we put because that
[1:14:55] relationship has been built up I can
[1:14:58] trust him him he never has failed me and
[1:15:01] again they're the things experienced as
[1:15:04] we go through and remember again and I
[1:15:08] say this in here in Christ and God is
[1:15:12] His Word he's not just some spirit off
[1:15:16] one place you know you can hear and
[1:15:18] right now if you if you would look up
[1:15:20] and get on YouTube and just see
[1:15:22] sometimes when I'm listening to one of
[1:15:24] the brothers preach you know all the
[1:15:26] other youtubes come up and there's quite
[1:15:27] a few ministers from different
[1:15:30] organizations and they're all talking to
[1:15:32] everybody about being you know
[1:15:34] having peace and and being trusting
[1:15:37] everybody is preaching the same message
[1:15:38] right now that's affecting the world you
[1:15:41] know but you got to go back to God's
[1:15:44] Word because that never fails he says my
[1:15:50] peace I give unto you not as the world
[1:15:53] giveth I was listening to a man and in
[1:15:56] the headline that they'd posted it
[1:15:58] caught my attention he said this man is
[1:16:00] talking about the peace and all and then
[1:16:03] on the very last five minutes he
[1:16:05] expressed please don't stop sending in
[1:16:08] your tithes in your offerings and that's
[1:16:10] what he preached for the last five
[1:16:11] minutes and if you've heard of this man
[1:16:15] he has like six private jets you know in
[1:16:19] other words hey I still want my private
[1:16:20] jets make sure you that's all everybody
[1:16:22] heard you took the effectiveness of the
[1:16:26] peace part and said hey but don't forget
[1:16:28] to like my pockets you know but God's
[1:16:31] Word doesn't say that God's Word says
[1:16:34] with nothing in your hand but with peace
[1:16:37] in your heart you're much better off
[1:16:40] yeah and it's again those experiences
[1:16:43] that we learn those things that we go
[1:16:44] through that that we can summon but God
[1:16:48] you brother BAM said of you cannot
[1:16:51] separate Jesus Christ you cannot zip
[1:16:53] Christ from his word because he is the
[1:16:55] word he was a word made flesh
[1:16:58] you cannot put him into separate places
[1:17:00] so if I want to know him I go back to
[1:17:03] see what he says what did he tell us how
[1:17:06] did he do it what did he and then we'll
[1:17:08] take the message because it was unveiled
[1:17:10] to us through the message and saying
[1:17:12] this is how it you were through this
[1:17:14] situation this is how God did I can look
[1:17:16] through the testimonies I can hear what
[1:17:18] other people have I can hear and all of
[1:17:21] us have done that was when somebody have
[1:17:22] even right behind this pulpit and shared
[1:17:24] their testimony of how God delivered
[1:17:26] them how God brought them out how God
[1:17:28] saved him and say yes I can believe that
[1:17:30] because that's what God said he would do
[1:17:31] in his word so you can't separate him
[1:17:34] from his word because he is the word so
[1:17:36] when you go back to the word and you go
[1:17:38] back into Psalms and you go back into
[1:17:40] some of those places and say Lord your
[1:17:42] word says so therefore I'm taking you at
[1:17:46] your word you know
[1:17:47] the the little widow woman that that had
[1:17:51] said all I have is is this much oil and
[1:17:54] and the creditors are coming and I've
[1:17:57] got no way to I'm going to lose I'm
[1:17:58] others and I believe it's Elijah just
[1:18:00] told them hey how many of those empty
[1:18:05] ones can you get fill them up and take
[1:18:08] God at His Word he'll meet your every
[1:18:09] need and you can go back and read those
[1:18:12] things you open up the cabinet doors and
[1:18:14] there's just maybe in one box left or
[1:18:17] one loaf of bread but remind herself in
[1:18:20] his word he took the fish into three
[1:18:23] loaves and fed 10,000 so he's still the
[1:18:26] same yesterday today and forever it's
[1:18:29] just so you can't separate that so and I
[1:18:32] was thinking about this I said
[1:18:34] experiences that me and my wife have had
[1:18:36] now as a married couples 40 years
[1:18:40] there's a lot of things you learned in
[1:18:42] 40 years and if the Lord desires another
[1:18:47] 20 here on this earth there's a lot more
[1:18:49] will learn in fact sometimes you'll
[1:18:51] probably forget more than you remember
[1:18:52] because there's been a lot of things
[1:18:54] that have but as I was thinking about
[1:18:56] that I said well how long has a
[1:18:58] relationship been with Christ and I said
[1:19:02] it's eternal you were part of him before
[1:19:07] this world even began he thought of you
[1:19:10] and this is where I want to get into
[1:19:12] that love story
[1:19:14] that relationship you were part of him
[1:19:17] you were as brother Graham said in the
[1:19:19] back of his mind you were a thought that
[1:19:22] was going to be expressed in its due
[1:19:25] time so the relationship began on the
[1:19:31] eternal side only you didn't know it
[1:19:33] until now on this side you're in a human
[1:19:37] body and you're saying Lord according to
[1:19:40] your word
[1:19:40] you know me you know be my name and
[1:19:43] you've proven it to me you've shown it
[1:19:45] to me so that relationship again it's
[1:19:48] eternal with him and as I was thinking
[1:19:51] about this I remembered that story that
[1:19:53] that brother Graham talked about that
[1:19:55] the young man that you know from the
[1:19:57] meat packing farm and and and he's going
[1:19:59] he says I will be back for
[1:20:01] you in one year that was his promise to
[1:20:04] her and the same as he says I will
[1:20:07] return to take you back until we can be
[1:20:10] together as he prayed in John 17 that
[1:20:12] they may be where I am
[1:20:13] that was you you were in his mind you
[1:20:17] know
[1:20:17] and so just looking at that and and this
[1:20:20] love story is because he's coming back
[1:20:22] to take you to claim you to bring you
[1:20:25] with him he says and as I was looking at
[1:20:28] and I said Lord our relationship goes
[1:20:30] back to Eternity and you see me already
[1:20:34] at your side so your word will not
[1:20:39] return void so therefore I can stand on
[1:20:43] that and I can claim it sometimes
[1:20:45] looking at myself and my experiencing
[1:20:47] then I say Oh Lord of what would you why
[1:20:49] would you want this guy and he says
[1:20:52] because I've seen you there already you
[1:20:54] were with me in the beginning so and it
[1:20:57] made me think going in that line there
[1:20:59] and I just want to read a couple quotes
[1:21:01] here let's start with that first one
[1:21:04] there brother Jeremy I believe and
[1:21:10] brother Matt had asked us to listen to
[1:21:13] and read the feast of the trumpets and I
[1:21:16] had this thought already and I just just
[1:21:18] caught me as brother bran begins to pray
[1:21:20] and he says Lord most any person here
[1:21:23] that can move their hands could turn the
[1:21:25] pages of this Bible but there is but one
[1:21:29] among us this morning that can open it
[1:21:31] and that's a great Holy Ghost which is
[1:21:34] in our myths and that's the point I
[1:21:38] would say Lord we all could read between
[1:21:40] the lines and come out with different
[1:21:43] messages different ideas different
[1:21:45] thoughts but if the Holy Spirit in each
[1:21:48] one of us is going to teach us back to
[1:21:51] the Word of God so he says open up to us
[1:21:54] the word Lord as we read as you did to
[1:21:57] the disciples as they went on on their
[1:21:59] road to Emmaus and begin to explain to
[1:22:02] them the scriptures and may we when we
[1:22:05] leave say like those who coming back to
[1:22:07] Jerusalem from Emmaus did not our hearts
[1:22:10] burn within us as he spake to us along
[1:22:13] the way
[1:22:14] it's the same thing today Ted not my
[1:22:17] heartburn today as I read his word as I
[1:22:21] prayed with him as I shared fellowship
[1:22:24] as we listened to the ministry in water
[1:22:26] did not my heart burn with us the same
[1:22:28] way as he reminded us what the scripture
[1:22:31] says remember the love letter that he
[1:22:34] wrote to you that's what it is sir we
[1:22:37] would see Jesus just a couple different
[1:22:40] things that he said did not our heart
[1:22:42] burn with this within us as he talked to
[1:22:44] us along the way we know that he did
[1:22:47] something before them just like he did
[1:22:49] before his crucifixion no other man ever
[1:22:53] did it like that and when he got to that
[1:22:55] when he got them on the other side and
[1:22:57] close the door then he did this thing
[1:22:59] that he did before and they recognized
[1:23:02] quickly that it was him he hadn't
[1:23:04] changed he was Jesus Christ the same
[1:23:06] yesterday day before he goes that's him
[1:23:08] they were able to identify him and then
[1:23:13] we go to Israel in the church I believe
[1:23:17] it is there
[1:23:19] yeah Israel in the church that wouldn't
[1:23:21] you know if you read the word write like
[1:23:24] this here it's alright but you sure miss
[1:23:27] the meaning of it the word is written
[1:23:29] between the lines jesus said I've hid it
[1:23:32] from the eyes of the wise and the
[1:23:34] prudent and revealed it to the babes
[1:23:36] such as would learn I'm one of those can
[1:23:41] you claim that I'm one of those you know
[1:23:43] and and just looking at that and I I
[1:23:46] think back sometimes that's over the
[1:23:48] years and and I don't know what what
[1:23:51] your background some of you have been
[1:23:52] raising this message that's what you've
[1:23:54] known your whole life others came on
[1:23:56] either in a non-christian background or
[1:23:58] maybe a total different denomination I
[1:24:00] think some of the things that we were
[1:24:01] taught as young people are growing up as
[1:24:04] children and and some of those and
[1:24:06] things that we thought was right the
[1:24:08] evidence of the Holy Spirit was speaking
[1:24:10] in tongues you know the different things
[1:24:13] and others brought in through a
[1:24:15] Trinitarian doctrine that there were you
[1:24:17] know the Father Son and the Holy Ghost
[1:24:19] but God said I will reveal it to those
[1:24:24] and in due time yes
[1:24:27] you know III always remember this when
[1:24:30] we first came to Tucson and I've shared
[1:24:33] this before right behind my parents
[1:24:37] house was a an older couple there and
[1:24:39] they had a daughter our age and we were
[1:24:41] going to high school together and he was
[1:24:43] a I don't remember I think he might have
[1:24:48] been a Baptist and a good good folks
[1:24:52] good folks and him and dad would talk
[1:24:55] quite a bit and her name is Alma and
[1:25:00] we're going to school together and we
[1:25:01] got to talking one day in the bus as we
[1:25:03] were traveling about the Scriptures and
[1:25:05] she she made the comment she goes well
[1:25:08] really it doesn't make a difference what
[1:25:12] you are on the inside it has to be on
[1:25:14] the inside and I thought about it I said
[1:25:18] you know okay so we shared a little bit
[1:25:21] I said but you know that life that's on
[1:25:23] the inside is going to demonstrate to
[1:25:24] the outside this little seed here is an
[1:25:27] apple seed but until it gives forth and
[1:25:31] breaks forth nobody knows for sure
[1:25:33] unless you know what an apple seed looks
[1:25:34] like yeah if you've never seen one you
[1:25:37] wouldn't know somebody told that's an
[1:25:38] apple seed but until it gives apples you
[1:25:40] see that's right that's an apple seed
[1:25:42] until Christianity begins to show hey
[1:25:44] that's a Christian so we got to talking
[1:25:46] a little bit and she was talking about
[1:25:48] the Godhead and with the Trinity and all
[1:25:50] and speaking to her back and my brother
[1:25:52] was with me younger brother and we're
[1:25:54] talking to her and she said you know it
[1:25:56] doesn't make a difference you know and
[1:25:57] this and she saying all these things and
[1:25:59] I said well but God had already began to
[1:26:02] unveil these things to us and just you
[1:26:04] just gave her a simple illustration and
[1:26:08] I said look I said here's a man you know
[1:26:12] he's human he's got a wife so he's a
[1:26:17] husband and he's got a child so he's a
[1:26:20] father I said is he three or is he one
[1:26:25] she stopped and she looked as she goes
[1:26:27] I've never heard that one before
[1:26:30] I go that's God and she was quiet about
[1:26:35] it unfortunately she never talked to us
[1:26:37] again
[1:26:38] but I wouldn't have not known that had
[1:26:41] God not unveiled that to us because we
[1:26:44] thought it as Jesus only others had the
[1:26:47] you know but because we're part of him
[1:26:50] he makes those things known to us
[1:26:52] it's a love letter it's him expressing
[1:26:54] his love that he had with us from before
[1:26:57] the foundation of the world back to us
[1:26:59] today
[1:27:01] let's go ahead and finish the quotes
[1:27:03] there and in sinuses many of the bodies
[1:27:10] of the saints that slept in the dust of
[1:27:13] the earth rosin came out of the grave
[1:27:15] and entered into the city Abraham Isaac
[1:27:18] Jacob and then brother Branham says he
[1:27:22] was talking about this at the time when
[1:27:23] Jesus resurrected and and also when when
[1:27:27] these Saints back there and says don't
[1:27:28] leave me here in Egypt take me to the
[1:27:31] promised land because they knew where
[1:27:34] the resurrection was coming and here
[1:27:36] brother Branham answers it to us
[1:27:37] therefore have anything you wish to but
[1:27:40] bury me in Christ for those things in
[1:27:45] Christ will God bring with him at his
[1:27:47] coming hide away from the world what a
[1:27:50] beautiful picture there it's between the
[1:27:53] lines what the Bible says and what you
[1:27:56] see in between the line goes right on
[1:27:58] with the rest of the word but it just
[1:28:01] fills up the gaps when you wonder why
[1:28:03] they was doing it it didn't change the
[1:28:05] Word of God it just shows you it makes
[1:28:08] it brother Branham says bury me in
[1:28:10] Christ and he goes see it it's the same
[1:28:14] type back then when they said take me to
[1:28:16] the promised land because on that
[1:28:18] resurrection morning that's when we're
[1:28:20] coming up and Jehovah Jireh that's where
[1:28:26] it is with God and not trying to study
[1:28:28] from the newspaper and standpoint some
[1:28:31] theological standpoint but fall in love
[1:28:33] with him get down and really get him in
[1:28:36] your heart the love of God shed abroad
[1:28:38] in their heart by the Holy Ghost then go
[1:28:41] to reading the Bible and you'll see it
[1:28:43] coming right out between the lines you
[1:28:45] realize he loves me that's what it is he
[1:28:48] loves me and this is why he's making it
[1:28:51] no this is what
[1:28:52] he's revealing it this is why I'm
[1:28:55] getting to see him and understand him J
[1:28:57] because he loves me
[1:28:58] and that's what he's sharing with me see
[1:29:01] you know that what he's saying he never
[1:29:03] said the rut that right out in the word
[1:29:05] Jesus thanked the father because he had
[1:29:07] hid those things from the eyes of the
[1:29:10] wise and the prudent and brother Branham
[1:29:11] even says that when he's ministering I
[1:29:13] thought it was this until he showed me
[1:29:16] what it was he was talking about his
[1:29:20] brother Matt covered it on the seals and
[1:29:21] those he studied LARC and he studied
[1:29:24] those because he was trying to find that
[1:29:25] he said but the Holy Spirit came into
[1:29:28] the room was that for brother Branham
[1:29:31] only no that's for each individual in
[1:29:34] Christ the Holy Spirit will reveal the
[1:29:37] Word of God to you not a different word
[1:29:40] but what's been unveiled to us already
[1:29:42] and in the last one communion did I give
[1:29:53] you that communion I'm sorry I did miss
[1:29:57] oh I missed Jehovah Jireh sorry then
[1:30:01] when I go overseas he says can you bring
[1:30:06] that down just a little bit when I go
[1:30:07] overseas I got a lovely wife and tell
[1:30:09] her now goodbye sweetheart you pray for
[1:30:11] me now she prays for me when I'm
[1:30:13] overseas and and while gone for months
[1:30:15] and I pick up the letter and she'll say
[1:30:17] dear Billy I'm sitting here tonight with
[1:30:18] the children thinking much of you now I
[1:30:21] see what she's writing on the paper but
[1:30:23] you see I love her so much till I can
[1:30:25] read between the lines I know what she's
[1:30:27] talking about and he goes that's the way
[1:30:29] it is with God you can't just sit down
[1:30:31] and read it in a cold formal heart
[1:30:34] you've got to be in love with the author
[1:30:36] and then you can read between the lines
[1:30:39] then you have an understanding of the
[1:30:42] scriptures but all let me say it this
[1:30:45] way you have an understanding the
[1:30:47] scriptures and it becomes a life in you
[1:30:50] and what is that life that very word of
[1:30:52] God is expressed out in you and and and
[1:30:55] Paul writes and and I didn't put the
[1:30:58] scriptures down but Paul writes it in
[1:30:59] Corinthians chapter 13 he says we have
[1:31:03] all of this but there's a greater
[1:31:05] a more excellent way he said and he
[1:31:08] begins to speak of the love of God in a
[1:31:11] true believer they don't they're not
[1:31:15] like this and and we could read all all
[1:31:17] thirteen but the verses but to save time
[1:31:19] he says they Envy not that there's an
[1:31:22] audience but they they have faith they
[1:31:24] have charity they have and it begins to
[1:31:27] express what a true believer who has a
[1:31:30] true relationship with Christ and knows
[1:31:33] what that love story is about and has
[1:31:35] read between the lines and said hey this
[1:31:37] is how God wants me I'm not filled with
[1:31:41] anger I'm not filled with this I'm
[1:31:42] filled with what God's Word says you
[1:31:46] know sometimes we get angry but the
[1:31:48] scripture says don't let the Sun go down
[1:31:50] on your anger say lord help me and he
[1:31:53] does let your love fill me and then we
[1:31:55] let's finish with communion then we'll
[1:31:57] get into some more scriptures here we
[1:32:01] are not of the world we are different
[1:32:04] from the world live a different life a
[1:32:07] separated life we are never to live the
[1:32:09] life of the world and be a Christian
[1:32:12] we're to live an outstanding life a
[1:32:14] different life now I don't mean that in
[1:32:18] the social ranks but I mean we are to
[1:32:20] live a life of genuine holiness that the
[1:32:23] fruits of the spirit might be seen in us
[1:32:25] of meekness and gentleness and patience
[1:32:28] and long-suffering faith the fruit of
[1:32:30] the Spirit see that's who Christ to us
[1:32:33] that's who Paul lays out in the
[1:32:35] scriptures so why would we be any
[1:32:36] different arrogant haughty saying I've
[1:32:40] got it you don't know that's contrary to
[1:32:42] what the scripture says but one that
[1:32:44] says know he loves me and I love him and
[1:32:46] therefore you're where my brother my
[1:32:48] sister so I could treat you no different
[1:32:49] I have no desire to treat you any
[1:32:52] different because it's Christ in me
[1:32:54] doing the same thing no I want I want to
[1:32:57] get into just a little bit of a
[1:32:59] scripture lesson here and you know how
[1:33:02] much we hear about Peter and in it I
[1:33:06] looked it up how many times Peters name
[1:33:08] is mentioned in the scriptures it's
[1:33:10] quite a few Peters mentioned this both
[1:33:14] both and most of the time he's he's
[1:33:16] getting in trouble or saying something
[1:33:18] or doing something
[1:33:19] and God has to say hey Peter or even
[1:33:22] Paul later after in the book of Acts is
[1:33:25] saying hey Peter look how you're acting
[1:33:27] you know and you know what it makes me
[1:33:30] it encourages me because hey if God
[1:33:33] loved Peter that we think God can love
[1:33:35] me too cuz I give troubles to you know
[1:33:38] it's the same way so if we go to Matthew
[1:33:41] 16 and then we'll just read these
[1:33:45] because just some of the scriptures here
[1:33:46] about Peter and look what he says and I
[1:33:48] say all also unto thee that thou art
[1:33:50] Peter and upon this rock I will build my
[1:33:53] church and the gates of Hell shall not
[1:33:56] prevail against it and we know that
[1:33:59] brother Branham preaches that that was
[1:34:01] revelation not Peter becoming the first
[1:34:05] Pope not the church being the rock but
[1:34:08] God revealing unveiling making it known
[1:34:11] to each individual he dresses that to
[1:34:14] Peter he didn't say now all you
[1:34:17] disciples the Lord just gave know Peter
[1:34:19] you got up you spoke because the father
[1:34:21] gave you that to speak so he addresses
[1:34:24] it to Peter that's how he addresses it
[1:34:26] to you he calls you by name it says this
[1:34:29] has come from the father and it has been
[1:34:31] revealed to you it's been made to you
[1:34:33] that hasn't changed and the gates of
[1:34:35] Hell shall not prevail against it so I
[1:34:38] can stand on that same promise the gates
[1:34:40] of Hell will not prevail against the
[1:34:42] revelation God has placed in my heart
[1:34:44] also because it's still the same
[1:34:45] yesterday today and forever then we go
[1:34:49] to Matthew 26 58 there's so many
[1:34:52] different scriptures in here and we see
[1:34:54] the life of Peter in all the things but
[1:34:56] he was there with Jesus with the
[1:34:59] disciples around Jesus this whole time
[1:35:01] and and they're there living those three
[1:35:03] and a half years with him you know when
[1:35:04] Jesus comes by and says come but come
[1:35:06] follow me and they heard all the things
[1:35:08] that God said they experienced them all
[1:35:10] now here comes the time the greatest
[1:35:13] fulfillment of everything that Jesus
[1:35:15] came to be born on earth or when he had
[1:35:19] told them already I have to go this way
[1:35:21] I must do this in order to fulfill all
[1:35:24] of this as to follow what the scripture
[1:35:26] says and for me to redeem you back this
[1:35:29] has to go and Peter and then same oh no
[1:35:32] don't do it
[1:35:32] No and then over here Peter saying I
[1:35:35] won't deny Oh in fact I'll go with you
[1:35:37] I'll be there with you along with all
[1:35:39] the other disciples you can read that
[1:35:41] too we always talk about Peter but
[1:35:43] there's a disciples you know wait a
[1:35:46] minute but you were gonna you were going
[1:35:48] to destroy the Romans and in 'but but he
[1:35:51] said no there's a better way now here it
[1:35:54] says now I just want to hit these parts
[1:35:55] here but Peter followed him afar off
[1:35:57] unto the high priests palace and went in
[1:36:00] and sat with his servants to see the end
[1:36:02] he became a spectator Peter the one that
[1:36:05] said I will never leave you I won't turn
[1:36:08] my back on you I will never
[1:36:10] he goes and he sits over there because
[1:36:12] he's just gonna sit back and watch let's
[1:36:14] see what happens that's what he said
[1:36:16] he went to see the end to watch what was
[1:36:20] going to happen verse 69 now Peter sat
[1:36:25] without the palace and a damsel came to
[1:36:27] him saying thou also was with Jesus of
[1:36:31] Galilee now we know what Peter's answers
[1:36:33] were no I wasn't I don't know what
[1:36:36] you're talking about the st. Peter who
[1:36:39] just a couple of days earlier was saying
[1:36:42] I'll never deny you
[1:36:43] thou art the Christ now he say tellin
[1:36:46] this damsel it goes no I don't even know
[1:36:48] him 73 and after a while came unto Him
[1:36:54] they that stood by and said to Peter
[1:36:56] surely thou art one of them for thy
[1:36:59] speech betrayeth thee you talk like them
[1:37:02] you talk to you you quote the scriptures
[1:37:05] your language is the same as theirs and
[1:37:07] again Peter denies it verse 75 and Peter
[1:37:16] remembered now we know that said Peter
[1:37:18] even cursed and then Peter remembered
[1:37:23] the words which Jesus said in him before
[1:37:26] the crow thou shalt deny me thrice
[1:37:29] and he went out and wept bitterly he
[1:37:33] hears that crowing and it reminds
[1:37:36] him what Jesus had told them and I'm
[1:37:39] sure if Peter was like us and I'm sure
[1:37:41] he was there's no hope for me
[1:37:45] I've betrayed him I failed him I turned
[1:37:48] my back on him I told him I would've and
[1:37:51] he went out and he wept bitterly where
[1:37:54] am I gonna find mercy where am I gonna
[1:37:56] find forgive us not knowing that that's
[1:37:59] exactly why Jesus was hanging on the
[1:38:02] cross for that reason and he still will
[1:38:08] forgive those who have done things that
[1:38:12] you and I would be embarrassed of and I
[1:38:15] like to bring this part in from mark
[1:38:17] chapter 16 verse 7 also maybe I gave you
[1:38:27] the wrong one mark 16 7 I'm sorry I did
[1:38:32] give you the wrong one no you've got 17
[1:38:35] mark 16 7 and he says but go your way
[1:38:41] tell his disciples and Peter that he
[1:38:44] goeth before you into Galilee there
[1:38:47] shall you see him as he said unto you he
[1:38:50] specifically said and tell Peter also
[1:38:54] behold I stand at the door and knock
[1:38:58] even though I said these things and I
[1:39:01] said this is the loudest seea and this
[1:39:03] is what you're I still stand at the door
[1:39:06] of your heart and knock and say come
[1:39:08] unto me all ye that are heavy laden and
[1:39:09] I will give you rest he says and tell
[1:39:13] Peter also to come how many are glad
[1:39:17] that he still says come on come hey
[1:39:21] there are some times that I don't feel
[1:39:22] worthy at all I say Lord I'm a failure
[1:39:24] but he says come on to me anyways come
[1:39:27] in here you know and so we think about
[1:39:30] those things that we see that in that
[1:39:32] relationship that they built of three
[1:39:34] and a half years with Christ fishermen
[1:39:37] that they were rough men you know you
[1:39:40] hear this comment made every once in a
[1:39:43] while they can curse worse than a sailor
[1:39:47] they have rough languages they you know
[1:39:49] we worked with one in at work that had
[1:39:52] just retired and he was the chief mate
[1:39:55] in one of the big ships
[1:39:58] and boy sometimes you just didn't want
[1:39:59] to be around him because his language
[1:40:01] was terrible it was just it was I mean
[1:40:03] it was filthy and he would say well it's
[1:40:05] just what I learned and we'd say but
[1:40:07] you're sitting here at the meeting you
[1:40:08] don't need to talk like that
[1:40:09] it's just not a good thing that's that's
[1:40:11] what these disciples came from they came
[1:40:13] a lot of them came from a rough
[1:40:14] background and God still said come
[1:40:18] follow me you're going to be my
[1:40:21] disciples
[1:40:24] uh-uh you know with us like one person
[1:40:26] said we want to clean the fish before we
[1:40:28] catch them but you got to catch them and
[1:40:31] land them first before you can clean
[1:40:32] them let God do the bringing in and
[1:40:35] landing and let God do the cleaning
[1:40:37] let us show an example of what a clean
[1:40:40] Christian is what God has done for us
[1:40:42] and say I've been where you're at but
[1:40:44] you can be where I'm at today
[1:40:46] let our life speak that way back to
[1:40:48] somebody I used to have those problems I
[1:40:50] used to be my habits that used to be my
[1:40:52] life but God has changed me you know God
[1:40:57] has done this and he can do that for you
[1:40:58] now
[1:40:59] so in in in their relationship with
[1:41:02] Christ it was very personal they walked
[1:41:05] with him they talked with him they slept
[1:41:07] on the ground if he slept on the ground
[1:41:09] they went to Lazarus how they they were
[1:41:11] with him all the time a few times it
[1:41:14] said that Jesus crossed over was alone
[1:41:16] then he came back out to meet him or he
[1:41:17] told them going buy some food I'm gonna
[1:41:19] go but most the time they were with him
[1:41:22] daily they saw him and he saw them - I'm
[1:41:27] sure he saw the squabbles I'm sure they
[1:41:29] saw the elbows I'm sure he's all the
[1:41:31] times that they said no I'm gonna sit
[1:41:33] closer to him no I'm gonna do this they
[1:41:37] were human they were like us Jesus saw
[1:41:41] it all and he says again Peter is the
[1:41:46] one that they really talk about in the
[1:41:48] scriptures and he says but go your way
[1:41:51] tell his disciples this is the angel
[1:41:55] speaking to him and Peter also
[1:41:57] specifically calls him by name I just
[1:42:00] tell him I want to have
[1:42:04] let's let's get into st. Luke chapter 24
[1:42:10] and I was looking through the chapter 24
[1:42:15] and st. Luke and it's it's after his
[1:42:17] death and resurrection and and it's
[1:42:22] quite a story there they've waited there
[1:42:24] the road to Emmaus is what most of us
[1:42:26] talk about there let's start with verse
[1:42:29] 1 in chapter 24 I'm st. Luke again part
[1:42:35] of that relationship now upon the first
[1:42:38] day of the week very early in the
[1:42:40] morning they came unto the sepulchre
[1:42:41] bringing the spices which they had
[1:42:43] prepared and certain others with him now
[1:42:46] didn't he tell them that in three days
[1:42:48] he would rise again but they came really
[1:42:51] expecting to find the body to an item go
[1:42:58] on go through this fairly quickly and
[1:43:00] they found the stone rolled away from
[1:43:02] the sepulchre verse three and they
[1:43:09] entered in and found not the body of the
[1:43:12] Lord Jesus he said in three days I'll
[1:43:16] write and if they had caught that word
[1:43:19] if they realized they would have said
[1:43:20] why are we looking for him because even
[1:43:22] they tell him that let's continue on and
[1:43:25] it came to pass as they were much
[1:43:27] perplexed thereabout wondering where did
[1:43:30] he go where's the body what happened
[1:43:32] behold two men stood by them in shining
[1:43:34] garments and as they were afraid and
[1:43:38] bowed their faces to the earth they said
[1:43:40] unto them why seek ye the living among
[1:43:43] the dead did not he tell you did not he
[1:43:48] say to destroy this temple in three days
[1:43:51] I'll rise it up again did not he refer
[1:43:55] to the scriptures and the prophecies and
[1:43:58] they're saying so why are you looking
[1:44:00] for him here for six he's not here
[1:44:05] but his risen remember how he spoke unto
[1:44:09] you when he was yet
[1:44:10] Galilee that's why angels tell him
[1:44:14] remember he told you this remember he
[1:44:16] talked member he said he would rise
[1:44:19] again remember he said my peace I give
[1:44:23] you not as the world remember said I'll
[1:44:26] never leave you I'm with you Kobach
[1:44:29] didn't he tell you those things wasn't
[1:44:31] it in the letter he wrote you I get to
[1:44:35] preach to some of the folks here this is
[1:44:39] to all of us in the letter that he wrote
[1:44:41] says that's what he's saying to you your
[1:44:43] mind I love you I have redeemed you he
[1:44:48] said well he was yet in Galilee he's
[1:44:50] telling them there he's not here he's
[1:44:52] risen saying the Son of Man must be
[1:44:55] delivered into the hands of sinful men
[1:44:56] and be crucified and the third day rise
[1:44:59] again it's the third day so why did you
[1:45:02] expect to find him here why did you come
[1:45:05] to me and ask me and not expect me to
[1:45:07] answer to meet your need to to be with
[1:45:09] you to comfort you because I said I'm
[1:45:12] the comforter I said I'm your peace I'm
[1:45:15] your joy and that's what you should
[1:45:17] expect it's gone and they remembered his
[1:45:23] words and I like that sometimes I have
[1:45:26] to stop and say Lord I just read to
[1:45:28] remember your words in this letter that
[1:45:32] you wrote to me it behooves me it's to
[1:45:35] my benefit it's good for me to remind
[1:45:37] myself by reading it by getting then
[1:45:41] opening up the scripture and say hey
[1:45:42] your word says in Psalms 23 the Lord is
[1:45:45] my shepherd it says in Jeremiah 29:11 I
[1:45:49] know the plans I have for you
[1:45:51] I can go to st. John 17 and read the
[1:45:53] prayer that you prayed for me and remind
[1:45:56] myself what your word says let's go on
[1:46:00] and return from the Sepulcher and told
[1:46:04] all these things unto the eleven and the
[1:46:06] rest they shared it and said hey listen
[1:46:08] do this verse 10 it was Mary Magdalene
[1:46:13] and Joanna and Mary the mother of James
[1:46:15] and other woman that were aware of them
[1:46:17] which told these things unto the
[1:46:19] disciples O Lord how dare you use
[1:46:24] nice men will just don't like that but
[1:46:28] you know what if I'll tell the Lord if
[1:46:31] you need to have a donkey speak to me
[1:46:32] because I won't listen do it Lord so
[1:46:34] that I can pay attention whatever it
[1:46:37] takes if God wants to use someone in
[1:46:40] your life your neighbor your friend your
[1:46:42] child your husband your wife a brother a
[1:46:44] sister whatever it is to get your
[1:46:46] intention and you say thank you Lord
[1:46:48] because you were mindful of me and their
[1:46:52] words seemed to them as idle tales and
[1:46:54] they believed them not that's then arose
[1:46:58] Peter and ran into the sepulchre and
[1:47:00] stooping down he said I gotta go find
[1:47:02] this out for myself and he beheld the
[1:47:04] linen clothes laid by themselves and he
[1:47:06] parted wondering himself what happened
[1:47:10] what has happened I denied him over
[1:47:14] there I I watched from a distance I
[1:47:17] heard that that rooster crow and so I
[1:47:20] know his words were true these three and
[1:47:23] a half years I saw him walk on the water
[1:47:25] in fact I walked on the water with him I
[1:47:27] saw him for what's happened what's
[1:47:31] taking place let's go on and behold two
[1:47:37] of them went the same day to a village
[1:47:39] called Emmaus which was from Jerusalem
[1:47:41] about threescore long they said you know
[1:47:43] what we got to go home now let's go back
[1:47:45] and they took a trip and I'm glad that
[1:47:49] when you go out you walk and you turn
[1:47:52] your back and I'm gonna say it that way
[1:47:53] you turn your back is you know what I'm
[1:47:54] just I'm just gonna go back that way
[1:47:56] he'll come and meet you he'll come out
[1:48:00] and he'll say hey hold on let me talk
[1:48:01] with you and they talked together of all
[1:48:03] the things which had happen brother
[1:48:05] sister wasn't it supposed to be like
[1:48:08] this didn't the pastor preach it this
[1:48:10] way didn't brother Branham say this I
[1:48:13] thought it was supposed to be this way
[1:48:16] then this scripture didn't Isaiah say
[1:48:18] didn't Jesus tell us and and this is
[1:48:21] what they're talking about 15 and it
[1:48:26] came to pass that while they come in
[1:48:28] together and reason Jesus himself junior
[1:48:31] and
[1:48:33] it comes by and he just hey guys no and
[1:48:37] in it just what are you guys talking
[1:48:38] about we can't be where that what talks
[1:48:41] about that in the scripture come that's
[1:48:42] gone and but their eyes were holding
[1:48:46] holding that they should not be holding
[1:48:48] they were for some reason God allowed it
[1:48:51] to be this way he said you know what
[1:48:53] they just didn't recognize it maybe it
[1:48:56] was in their misery
[1:48:57] maybe it wasn't their sadness maybe it
[1:48:59] was in their confusion that they didn't
[1:49:01] realize that was him walking with him
[1:49:04] and he said unto them what manner of
[1:49:07] communications are these that you have
[1:49:09] one to another as you walk and you're
[1:49:11] sad wait a minute brother wait a minute
[1:49:15] sister I'm looking upon you you're
[1:49:16] walking you seem disappointed
[1:49:18] you seem brokenhearted and and and some
[1:49:20] of the things you're saying I thought he
[1:49:23] said he would never leave me I thought
[1:49:26] he said that I wouldn't you're talking
[1:49:29] like you're disappointed you're talking
[1:49:31] like you're hurt this is what he what's
[1:49:32] your communication why are you talking
[1:49:34] like this he's talking to them you're
[1:49:36] sad you you're down fallin you know
[1:49:38] you're you're brokenhearted eighteen and
[1:49:42] one of them whose name was Cleopas
[1:49:44] answered him are Theo are you the only
[1:49:46] stranger in Jerusalem did you know
[1:49:48] what's going on haven't you heard CNN
[1:49:50] didn't you hear this news didn't you
[1:49:52] heard the latest up do you know what
[1:49:53] governor Ducey said did you miss all of
[1:49:55] this or view better Jesus and has not
[1:49:59] known these things which are come to
[1:50:00] pass them these days are you not aware
[1:50:02] what we're having no idea that they all
[1:50:05] came to pass because of him and for him
[1:50:07] for them let's go on and he said unto
[1:50:11] them what thinks and they said and I'm
[1:50:14] concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a
[1:50:17] prophet mighty in deed and word before
[1:50:19] God in all the people they began to
[1:50:21] preach back to him 20 and how the chief
[1:50:25] priests and our rulers delivered him to
[1:50:27] be condemned to death and have crucified
[1:50:28] him even though he told us that was
[1:50:31] what's gonna take place let's continue
[1:50:34] on but we trusted that ahead that it had
[1:50:38] been he which should have redeemed
[1:50:40] Israel and besides all this today is the
[1:50:44] third day since
[1:50:45] these things were done yeah that's right
[1:50:50] it's the third day when you should have
[1:50:52] been looking for a resurrected Christ
[1:50:54] it's the third day but you're turned in
[1:50:57] your and your broken heart and your
[1:50:59] sadness and your wandering and your
[1:51:00] walking in the other direction and
[1:51:03] sometimes we'd get to that time in our
[1:51:05] lives Lord where are you I don't know
[1:51:08] brother branham said that this guy was
[1:51:11] like brass to him at one time just
[1:51:12] thought broken hearted wondering God
[1:51:14] doesn't talk to me God doesn't answer me
[1:51:16] God it's a part of everybody's life but
[1:51:19] just look at it on the third day they
[1:51:21] should have said we should be out here
[1:51:23] looking for him he's resurrected but
[1:51:25] they're walking the other direction yes
[1:51:28] and certain women also of our company
[1:51:31] made us astonished
[1:51:32] they were early they're at the gravesite
[1:51:34] that's a poker and when they found not
[1:51:37] his body they came saying that they had
[1:51:39] also seen a vision of angels which said
[1:51:41] that he was alive could this really be
[1:51:46] we don't know where this is not how we
[1:51:49] thought it was going to work out let's
[1:51:52] continue on and certain of them which
[1:51:54] were with us went to the sepulchre and
[1:51:56] found it even so as a woman had said but
[1:51:58] they didn't see him they didn't find him
[1:52:00] they didn't see the vision of the angels
[1:52:02] neither did they find Jesus and he said
[1:52:06] unto them o fools
[1:52:08] you know what we've heard the
[1:52:11] description of a word a fool it's a
[1:52:13] person that says there is no God and
[1:52:18] today is the day the honor people like
[1:52:20] that I think they called it April Fool's
[1:52:22] Day and he said unto Him old fools I
[1:52:26] think to me this is just me okay he's
[1:52:29] just saying wait a minute are you saying
[1:52:30] God died are you saying he didn't
[1:52:34] resurrect are you telling me that he
[1:52:38] says then slow of heart to believe all
[1:52:39] that the prophets have spoken everything
[1:52:44] in the scripture that prophesied of me I
[1:52:46] fulfilled it yet you're questioning in
[1:52:49] it you're wondering about it let's go on
[1:52:53] what not Christ to have suffered these
[1:52:55] things and to enter into his glory isn't
[1:52:57] that what the scripture says isn't that
[1:52:59] what he told you and beginning at Moses
[1:53:03] and all the prophets he expounded unto
[1:53:05] them all the Scriptures the things
[1:53:08] concerning to himself and what a brother
[1:53:10] branham's he'll tell us when you take
[1:53:12] this word and it's Jesus Christ the same
[1:53:16] yesterday from beginning to the end
[1:53:18] that's exactly what he did
[1:53:20] he went back and said from the beginning
[1:53:22] the scripture spoke of this and he
[1:53:24] expounded that to them and they drew
[1:53:28] nigh unto the village where the weather
[1:53:30] they went and he made as though he would
[1:53:32] have gone on is it ok guys I'm good
[1:53:34] talking with you but I've got to go away
[1:53:37] there but something about them was
[1:53:39] starting to pull and draw and they
[1:53:41] constrained him saying abide with us for
[1:53:44] it's evening time and the day is far
[1:53:45] spent and it's going to get dark soon
[1:53:47] and it's dangerous going down the road
[1:53:49] you know there's thieves and robbers on
[1:53:51] the way he says so why don't you stay
[1:53:53] with us the night and he went as to into
[1:53:55] tarry with them yeah he says ok that
[1:53:58] that's a good idea I'll go in with you
[1:54:00] they still don't know it's him and it
[1:54:03] came to pass as he sat up meet with him
[1:54:06] he took bread and blessed it and brake
[1:54:08] it and gave to them 31 and their eyes
[1:54:13] were open and they knew him and he
[1:54:16] vanished out of their sight he came back
[1:54:19] and he did what he's always done he's
[1:54:23] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:54:25] and forever it's not a new special
[1:54:29] revelation for our age it's not
[1:54:31] something that nobody's never had he
[1:54:33] said the love letter is the word of God
[1:54:36] all of it he says but the Holy Spirit we
[1:54:40] go and he opened their eyes and they
[1:54:42] realized that was him did not our hearts
[1:54:46] burn I realize it's him there's
[1:54:50] something about his presence when it
[1:54:52] draws nigh and draws and comes close
[1:54:53] you've been a hate that's the Lord and
[1:54:55] you humble yourself and you quite your
[1:54:57] spirit say Lord that's you because
[1:55:00] you've experienced him before and they
[1:55:03] said to one another did not our heart to
[1:55:05] bring with us while he talked
[1:55:07] with us by the way and while he opened
[1:55:10] to us the scriptures he opened to them
[1:55:12] the scriptures
[1:55:13] brother Bram says it takes the Holy
[1:55:15] Ghost to open he's the same yesterday
[1:55:18] today and forever and they rose up the
[1:55:21] same Mountain returned to Jerusalem and
[1:55:23] found the eleven gathered together and
[1:55:24] then that were with him he they went
[1:55:27] back and turn around I said let's head
[1:55:28] back to Jerusalem and share it the
[1:55:31] sisters were right he is alive He is
[1:55:34] risen
[1:55:35] saying the Lord has risen has appeared
[1:55:38] to Simon and they told what things were
[1:55:41] done on the way and how he was known of
[1:55:43] them in the breaking of bread brother
[1:55:44] Brown says they just saw that he was the
[1:55:47] same he did it he didn't change it
[1:55:49] exactly the same he's consistent he's
[1:55:52] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:55:54] that's the Lord can point back to it
[1:55:56] point back to it that's gone that's gone
[1:55:58] that's God there's no question in it and
[1:56:00] as they thus spake Jesus himself stood
[1:56:03] in the midst of them and he saith unto
[1:56:05] them peace be unto you even his greeting
[1:56:08] fear not peace be unto you that didn't
[1:56:11] change brother Branham says you began to
[1:56:14] talk about him you began to speak about
[1:56:17] him and he draws near and that's what
[1:56:20] they were doing now they Rika sat down
[1:56:22] there being talk listen what happened
[1:56:23] because and suddenly he was in their
[1:56:26] best that's continued on 37 but they
[1:56:34] were terrified and frightened and
[1:56:36] suppose that they had seen the spirit
[1:56:37] they just finished telling him and he
[1:56:40] appeared to us and he says and they got
[1:56:43] afraid though the other disciples wait a
[1:56:45] minute who was that the same one that
[1:56:47] walked in the water he even showed him
[1:56:50] the nail-scarred hands he showed him he
[1:56:53] was Jesus Christ still but they got
[1:56:55] afraid and he said unto them why are you
[1:56:57] troubled and why do the thoughts arise
[1:56:59] in your heart behold my hands and my
[1:57:02] feet that it is myself handle me and see
[1:57:05] for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as
[1:57:07] you see me here he said come and touch
[1:57:10] me come and fill me let me prove it to
[1:57:12] you even we know what he did with Thomas
[1:57:15] he said doubting Thomas so sometimes we
[1:57:18] wonder sometimes we questioned but he'll
[1:57:20] come by
[1:57:21] Hey look I'm here you can experience me
[1:57:25] again
[1:57:26] I haven't changed and when he had thus
[1:57:30] spoken he showed them his hands and his
[1:57:31] feet and while they yet believed and
[1:57:36] while they yet believed not for joy and
[1:57:38] wondered he said unto them have you here
[1:57:41] any meat they're still having trouble
[1:57:44] can it could it be did his appearance
[1:57:47] change so much they couldn't recognize
[1:57:48] him what was it it was just having
[1:57:53] trouble of saying in their hearts I know
[1:57:56] he said that but could it be and every
[1:57:59] once while we get to that place I know
[1:58:01] you said that Lord but could it be but
[1:58:05] let let us rather take Lord I know you
[1:58:07] said it and it will be Lord if I have to
[1:58:10] I'll say lord help my unbelief and they
[1:58:14] gave him a piece of broiled fish and of
[1:58:17] a hand out of a honeycomb and he took it
[1:58:20] and did eat before them and he said unto
[1:58:24] Him these are the words which I spoken
[1:58:26] to you while I was yet with you that all
[1:58:28] things must be fulfilled which were
[1:58:31] written in the law of Moses and the
[1:58:32] prophets and in the Psalms concerning to
[1:58:35] me
[1:58:35] everything that God said concerning him
[1:58:38] and concerning us will be fulfilled
[1:58:41] because his word never returns void then
[1:58:46] opened he their understanding that they
[1:58:48] might understand the scriptures again
[1:58:50] brother Branham said it takes the Holy
[1:58:52] Spirit to open the understanding of the
[1:58:55] scriptures and he said unto Him thus it
[1:58:58] is written and thus it behoove Christ to
[1:59:00] suffer and to rise from the dead of the
[1:59:02] third day because this is how I am
[1:59:06] redeeming you restore him back to that
[1:59:09] fellowship that I had with you from
[1:59:11] before the fountain and that repentance
[1:59:13] and remission of sins should be preached
[1:59:15] in his name among all the nations
[1:59:17] beginning at Jerusalem and ye are
[1:59:21] witnesses of these things are you a
[1:59:23] witness of these things that he's the
[1:59:26] same he's telling your witness and
[1:59:27] behold I send the promise of my father
[1:59:30] upon you but tarry this
[1:59:32] of Jerusalem until you be endued with
[1:59:35] power from on high
[1:59:37] remember he said I told you of a better
[1:59:39] way
[1:59:40] he said now go there to Jerusalem and
[1:59:42] wait because that better ROI is coming
[1:59:46] and he led them out as far as Bethany
[1:59:48] and he lifted up his hands and he
[1:59:51] blessed them and it came to pass while
[1:59:53] he blessed them they were and he was
[1:59:55] parted from them and carried up into
[1:59:57] heaven and they worshiped him and
[2:00:01] returned to Jerusalem with great joy and
[2:00:04] we're continually in the temple praising
[2:00:08] and blessing God amen and they realized
[2:00:13] that their hearts were full and they
[2:00:15] went now to fulfill what he told them go
[2:00:18] to Jerusalem and wait until you be
[2:00:21] filled with this promised that better
[2:00:24] way I'll be in you not with you he said
[2:00:29] it's a better way you've had me with you
[2:00:31] but all being it and if that same spirit
[2:00:34] that raised Christ from the dead dwells
[2:00:37] in you it will quicken bring to life
[2:00:40] this mortal body because without it we
[2:00:43] don't have that resurrection he's Jesus
[2:00:46] Christ the same yesterday Dave and he
[2:00:49] tells us that in his letter to us his
[2:00:52] love to us what he done for us what why
[2:00:56] how he redeemed us how he wants us at
[2:00:59] his side how he wants us to reign with
[2:01:01] him how there's an eternal an eternal
[2:01:04] gathering with him he said that's what
[2:01:06] all this is for to take us back to what
[2:01:09] we had in the beginning
[2:01:11] if the love letter doesn't tell you that
[2:01:14] then I'd say go back and read it again
[2:01:16] if the love letter doesn't tell you how
[2:01:19] much he loves you and cares for you and
[2:01:21] how much you mean to him and even though
[2:01:23] you're going through the hard times and
[2:01:25] the difficult times he still loves you
[2:01:27] and he still cares for you then go back
[2:01:28] and read it again until it speaks the
[2:01:31] same that what he said to his disciples
[2:01:33] to you because he's Jesus Christ the
[2:01:36] same yesterday today
[2:01:39] let's bow our heads of the musicians
[2:01:41] would make their well Lord we thank you
[2:01:45] that and and and we say appreciate Lord
[2:01:48] I so appreciate that it's not our own
[2:01:50] understanding and it's not our ideas and
[2:01:54] it's not our being able to take it and
[2:01:56] put it all together to to try to form
[2:01:58] that perfect picture Lord but it's
[2:02:00] Christ in us it's the Holy Spirit in us
[2:02:03] they can take this word and unveil it to
[2:02:06] us and make it live in us and through us

[2:02:12] bride Lord a one that is chosen by you
