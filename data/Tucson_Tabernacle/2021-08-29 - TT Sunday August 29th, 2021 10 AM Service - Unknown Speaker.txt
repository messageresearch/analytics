terrible so we're gonna we're gonna remember her today brother ed also passed along that brother nate dugal fell and injured his arm and is asking for prayer so we're going to pray for that but what i wanted to do different today was one of my least favorite things about how we sit is how far apart we are and one of my favorite songs is hallelujah and that is a prayer and that's a praise and that's a worship so i'm not coming after you if you are able and you would like to i want us to filter towards the middle don't come down just come towards the middle and we are going to pray and sing for about 10 to 15 minutes and we're going to sing hallelujah and we're going to worship the lord so brother jeremy can you put me on the purple one so if you want to stand up and move i would love that i'm coming down to the middle and we're going to do that this morning and we're just going to we're just going to praise the lord i have not wanted to do it in part sometimes because it feels like a gimmick but it won't be if we don't make it one so i'm just going gonna start singing [Music] [Music] [Music] lu [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] a [Music] lu [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music]

jesus thank you lord psalms chapter 107 if you have your bible we'll go straight to the word this morning amen i'd like to just say hello amen i greet you in the name of the lord and it's certainly a privilege to be here appreciate by the matthew i know that's not a an easy thing to do to lead worship like that acapella but you don't need music or instruments or even voices even hands you don't need anything to worship the lord because worship comes from the innermost part of your being amen psalms chapter 107 i just want to take a thought here this morning and i just would just say that the lord has dealt with me and changed my course completely even this morning i was just praying about what direction to go and then had a direction and the lord just turned my course and turned me completely to the side so you just trust that whatever it is that you need god knows all about it whatever it is that you have a desire for even before you could ask it the lord already knows do you believe that amen i'm so thankful for that psalms chapter 107 and let's just begin reading here at verse 23. i spoke on this along the lines of this during the time that we were in uh quarantine or separated through we were doing the live streaming and lord just pulled me back this direction again so i'd like to speak to you this morning on a place called wit's end a place called wit's end and i'm not talking about adventures in odyssey wits in either for all you adventures and odyssey listeners something completely different let's look at this here together verse 23 they that go down to the sea and ships that do business in great waters these see the works of the lord and his wonders in the deep for he commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind which lifteth up the waves thereof they mount up to the heaven they go down again to the depths their soul is melted because of trouble they reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man and are at their wit's end then they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he bringeth them out of their distresses he maketh the storm a calm so that the waves thereof are still let's just bow our heads here together if you have a need maybe something upon your heart while your head or heads are bowed won't you just raise that up to the lord by an uplifted hand lord jesus we're thankful for your your presence lord that's in this place thankful lord god that we have a place where we can go to lord a building where we could gather lord not bound or in bondage from sin not bound in bondage by dead religion lord but we're free today lord because you set us free we're your sons and more daughters lord god we we're your children now lord may you come father and move me out of the way completely lord i pray that you would just have your way i believe lord jesus you have something that you want to say may you do it may you speak it lord we ask and we'll give you all the glory all the honor all the praise lord may you meet these needs by these uplifted hands we ask in jesus christ's name and the church said amen you can be seated this morning david is describing here and he says here in verse 23 we'll just read it again they that go down to the sea and ships that do business in great waters these see the works of the lord and his wonders in the deep for he commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind which lifteth up the waves thereof they mount up to the heaven they go down again into the depths their soul is melted because of trouble they reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man and are at their wit's end he's speaking here of a sailor one who knows the sea one who knows his boat and he's tossed here in this storm and it's an incredible thing that how much the bible speaks about storms and even through the life of david there's many psalms there's two or three other that speak similar things like this we know that jesus spoke to storms jesus was in storms the apostle paul was also a man who the bible chooses to give us a detail of his life about a shipwreck from a storm i thought it's interesting the lord turned me this direction even this morning and there's a great storm approaching louisiana i want to be in prayer for those that are in the path of that hurricane and that storm but it's incredible because this storm that david is speaking of here he says they they reel to and fro and they stagger like a drunken man these giant waves that are coming against their ship uh he says that it drops them down to the depths and the the powerful winds toss them back and forth so that there is no control they've lost all control and all ability to to control the ship anymore they've just lost it completely and entirely and the sailors are are crying out the bible says they stagger they weren't drunk but they staggered like drunk men they didn't know what to do it's amazing when you lose control of your vessel when you lose control of what god has given you to get you from one place to the other and paul had found that out when he loses control of the ship that he was in to accomplish the mission that god had for him but now that ship had broken up in pieces and paul finds himself in the ocean clinging to a piece of what used to carry him and this is very similar to what these sailors david is speaking of are going through they have lost all ability they have came to their wits in they stagger across the the cells to the ship are tattered and ripped and wave after wave powerful waves crash onto the deck and these sailors are just struggling to do everything they can just to hold on just to make it and it looks like it's over looks like everything is just going to end in total despair they're helpless they're vulnerable and it's the power of the elements and they're unable to stop the storm paddle powerless to save themselves and the bible's david says they've reached this place called wits in it's a place that we all are very familiar with in our own life and our own journey of life that we reach many times to where we give all control and we've lost all ability well uh whatever you did there brother jeremy if you could change it back i uh being able to hear myself this tucson dryness dries my throat out so i need that thank you amen god bless you but but they they have lost all ability and and they are they're in a place of wits in where they're totally helpless unable to help themselves it's the phrase means that they've lost or they've exhausted any possibility of perceiving or thinking of a way out of the trouble they've in short what you could say is this was the end of human ability it's the end of human resources it's the end of human intervention there's no escape there's no human help there's no there's no lifeboat there's no way for them to save themselves it's going to take god that's what it means when he speaks of wits in it's a place where they've reached all ability uh they've really reached a place of complete human ability has been exhausted and they can no longer trust in themselves or their ability to save themselves i'm going to read you some scriptures here from jeremiah you don't have to turn but it says thus sayeth the lord is speaking of trust thus saith the lord cursed be the man that trusteth in man cursed be the man that trusteth in man now it's not just speaking of trusting of yourself but trusting any man or any flesh he goes on he says and maketh flesh his arm and whose heart departeth from the lord for he shall be like a heath in the desert and shall not see when good cometh but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness in assault land and not inhabited it's amazing how much we cling to human ability even as believers and christians and we trust completely and entirely in the lord but you know in times of calamity in times of distress and in time of a storm and you know i'm just going to say this here today there's a reason the lord has me preaching on this today somebody's in a storm in this building and it's amazing how much we cling on to our ability to save ourselves though trusting in the lord it's amazing how much we cling even to a place to where we've came through so much and we've the lord has brought us that we can all here just testify all of us here today would have a testimony of the grace of god that has brought us to today's date the only reason you're here in your right mind with a mind and a heart to want to worship and serve the lord there's only one reason and that's because of overwhelming grace that god has bestowed in our life that has kept us day by day how did you get here ask yourself that question this morning how did i arrive here at church in august of 2021 how did i get here i could look back at my life and through the journey of my life and boy i could say there's been a lot of good times lord's done a lot of good things for me there's been a lot of happy moments there's been a lot of times where i've rejoiced but oh as i look over down the road that i've traveled there's been a lot of times that were hard a lot of times where i struggled a lot of times where i had to fight with tooth and nail just to make it to wake up and get out of bed that morning am i preaching to anybody today that's maybe came through hard times you could say i've been through a lot i've been through a lot of struggle i've had to bury loved ones i've had to to not even have a i've struggled to have an understanding to make sense out of what's happened there's been a lot of good there's been a lot of rejoicing there's been a lot of happy but there's been a lot of sadness there's been a lot of sorrow there's been a lot of loss because that's what this life is really about this life the bible says a man is a few days and full of trouble it's a few days and full of trouble really if we'd be honest that's really what life is it's full of trouble it's full of struggle the entire life even as a believer brother matt but you're a christian yeah i'm a christian and that's when i realized the struggle that i'm really in is when i got born again i really understood that that life is all about a death cycle that the from the moment the baby is born i heard a man recently say he said we we've got it backwards we ought to be mourning over the birth and rejoicing over the death if you really think of real reality because when you're born into this world it's a few days and full of trouble and some of us have had our fair share and some of us could tell can look back over life's journey and say it's not been easy there's been easy times but it's been a struggle and it's been hard and i've had to struggle to fight and and but you say but brother man but it's been a struggle but let me just remind you my dear brother my dear sister who's came through some hard times and some hardships and some great storms let me just remind you look around you're still here you're still here you're still going to hard something inside you to worship the lord you still are raising your hand saying amen to the word of god you still have your right mind you say how did i arrive here today because one day yesterday god had grace and the day before that he had grace and if he brought if grace is what brought me to today i can trust that it will be grace that will keep me tomorrow it's all grace and it's been he he says and shall not see in a salt land and not a habited blessed is he and you've been through a lot through the deep it's incredible because though we've been through so much yet we always as believers every one of us none of us are exempt we can come to this place of wits in where we just want to give up we just want to throw the white flag of surrender and and just walk out and if we'd be honest some of us are facing that emotion because that's what it is it's an emotion some of us are facing that emotion of giving up just giving up and it's incredible even some who've been through so much and god has brought you through so much yet the darkest is right before the dawn the darkest night is right before the dawn it gets brother branham said it gets to that place the most dangerous time to drive is not in the night he says but it's in the in the du he says right before the sun comes up right at dawn that's what he called it and he said right at dawn right before the sun comes he says that's the most dangerous times when the sun's setting and the sun's rising because it's not completely dark it's not light yet and he says it's hazy and you can't really see your way you can't really see your way too clear and it's incredible because some of the greatest some of the the greatest strongest feeling of giving up and giving over and quitting on god comes right before deliverance right before god is about to deliver you and you have made it through the deep seas of life and you've made it through the deep troubles and god has kept you through the ocean the deep of the the sea when it was when when when if you did fall in the water you would have drowned but now you're in shallow water now you're almost to the shore now you're almost to the other side and right when you're in and right when you're almost out of it and shallow water is when you have this feeling of giving up it's amazing because people drown in shallow water and sometimes people drown in shallow water can sometimes people can make it through deep water but drown in the shallows are you here today i said sometimes people make it through the deepest struggles and then allow satan to destroy them in the shallow water when they could when when they when they when they could make it when they could handle it when they could go on but they they give up they throw in the towel they've reached wit's end and they've survived so much they've been through so much and it's incredible it's it's incredible but the toughest part of the struggle is not in the beginning of the struggle the trump is part of the trial you know when you're strong and you're vibrant and you've got faith and you've got energy and and it's the beginning the toughest times let me say this the toughest toughest times of life are not at the beginning uh uh because the struggle that you come into you've got you've got you've got faith you've got hope you've got love you're vibrant you're ready but it's when you are closest to the shore that you are the most vulnerable to collapsing when you are the most when you are the closest to the finish line you know you see that a marathon runners and they've ran and they've endured mile after mile after mile and just going in water and going and going and going but man when they see that finish line you watch some of them almost ready to collapse right before you're about to cross over right before you're about to finish your race even i was hearing even some of this what i'm speaking about today is hearing a minister speak on this and it was he gave it a statistic that was just mind-blowing that most fatal accidents car accidents happen within a mile to two miles from the house when you're almost home just a mile or two away when you've already made it through and you've already driven through and and now now you're you're this close this close to be home not 20 not 30 not 40 miles not 10 miles but sometimes when you're the closest to shore is when you're the most vulnerable to giving up and things can become the most difficult are you here today say amen they come to this place called wits in and they've they come to that storm to where you don't hear the voice of the lord so clearly and you don't and even even even even just a whisper sometimes the voice of the lord drowns down and is drowned out by this by the the circumstances and all you hear is just a whisper from the lord and job got to the place to where he could say how i got children who have died i've got family who have lost and job comes to this place and says i can't see the lord i can't see him he even comes in the book of job and says i can't perceive him i've looked left and he's not there i look right and he's not there i've i've searched high and low and he says and i just can't perceive them he was there but now i can't find him has anybody ever felt that way i looked on one side and i couldn't find him i can't perceive him where is he at and sometimes if we're not careful we allow the devil to sell us a lie that the presence of a storm means the absence of god and some of us have bought into a lie that just because we're in difficult tough hard struggles that the presence of great trial must mean the absence but let me tell you sometimes it's the very opposite to a child of god the presence of your struggle is proof of the creator that he's in the middle of your storm the presence of the enemy is only proof that the presence of god is near you take that devil the presence of my current struggle and trouble and all of the calamity and i can't figure it out i'm throwing up my hands the presence of that is proof that god is right on the scene and right on time we get to this place to where we can't find him job said i can't figure it out i can't how could how could my how could i lose everything and god be with me how can i have loss of family and god's with me how could i have health issues and god's with me and if i don't see him i can't see him i looked on the right how could how could it be let me just say this that's this is why this is why the bible says that in order to serve the lord you've got to walk by faith and not by sight you've got to walk by faith not by what you feel you've got to walk by faith and not by what you see because sometimes what you see can become discouraging and you get to the place to where but let me just say this god does some of his greatest work in your life when you're in the midst of trouble and struggle and you you're like job you can't see him you can't feel him you can't touch him you can't hear him but yet something beyond you reaches out and says but lord i still believe but lord i'm still gonna worship you but lord i'm still gonna press on but lord i'm still gonna serve you but lord i'm still gonna have faith i can't see can't hear can't feel can't touch because worship from the soul and the times when you don't feel it is some of the most acceptable worship to the lord they got to this place to where they couldn't see it and they they they couldn't hear it it's amazing because david says here he says let me let me just move past this so we're never going to get to our thoughts let me just go on he says blessed is the man this is jeremiah blessed is the man that trusteth in the lord and whose hope is the lord cursed be the man who trusteth in the arm of flesh and man and maketh flesh his arm but blessed is the man remember what it says it said cursed is the man and he gets to a place who began who who he he he almost comes to a place to where he's drowning and shallow water and let me just say this to you my brother my sister sometimes when you're in great calamity don't trust your senses you can't trust your feelings you can't even you can't you can't trust it's it's he says it's like a uh psychiatrist even has said that a person who gets to that place it's like a pilot flying uh an airplane uh but he but he's he can't look at his his gauges and he says because his gage has he's completely lost trust in everything around him he's lost trust in people he's lost trust in family he's lost trust in friends because that pressure gets you to a place to where you can't curse and be the man that trusteth in the flesh but david said blessed is the man who trusteth in the lord for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters that spreadeth out her roots by the river do you say lord that's what i want i want to be that tree planted by the rivers of water and shall not see when the heat cometh but her leaf shall be green and shall not be careful in the year of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit the first person jeremiah speaks of doesn't wait for the lord to move he takes matters into his own hands makes his own plans turns to people he thinks that our people of influence he takes shortcuts he's trusted in the arm of flesh scheming planning manipulating you know this is exactly us descriptive perfectly sometimes in our life when we try to figure it out we try to get ourself out of a mess and we try to solve the problem and scripture says the bible says a spiritual dryness sets in he shall be like the heath verse six you know what that is that's like a shrub it's a shrub in the desert he looks barely alive with no fruit no wellspring of life he's on the brink of passing away he he shall same verse there in verse six he shall not see when good cometh he never partakes in the joy this is what it is he never partakes in the joy uh being being delivered by god's hand because he's he wants to be delivered by his own hand and the bible says he shall see he shall not see when good cometh he's in perched places that's isolated places he withers but but now i want you to look here look at the man who trusts in the lord and whose hope in verse 7 is the lord he's planted he has roots he has stability he has living water he's spreading out he's fruitful and green and fresh with life the bible says he shall not be careful that means fearful he shall not be fearful in the year of drought when things get hot when things get scorching when the weather when the storms come he won't be afraid oh that's why romans chapter 8 verse 37 the apostle paul begins to say nay in all these things what are these things and all of the troubles and all of the struggles and all of the hard times we are more than conquerors through him that loved us trials can come and they can be very very different and some and and you could almost categorize a trial trial could be like a crisis sometimes it could be like a crisis something suddenly that you've came into then there's trials that are more steady almost like a relentless constant pressure that just wear away at our resistance and wear us down and wear us down and wear us down and we've all got them and we we say brother matt what do we do and that in that time we should pray more we should trust the lord more but for some reason in our greatest calamity somehow that's the time when we find ourselves sometimes the hardest time to pray the hardest time to have faith the hardest time to consult the lord we consult everything else around us except the only thing that has the answer can you say amen this morning you say i struggle why why don't i pray for the why don't i pray the greatest weapon the prophet of god said that god that god ever gave to man and you can type that in and there's there's 11 or 12 different weapons brother adam gives but he comes almost always to the same thing the greatest weapon god ever gave man was prayer if it's my greatest weapon then why when i'm in my greatest battle don't i find myself using my greatest weapon the answer is very simple it's not complicated it's not science it's not it's not some complicated answer i'm going to give it to you very simple it's because we believe too much in ourselves you know what it's called it's called pride not enough humility we relied too much on i'm gonna fix it i'm gonna fix it for myself the sailors had no answer the sailors had no answer you know why here's why give me that first slide brother jeremy to my powerpoint if you could i'm going to give you a ho i'm not sure i hope they could see this well i've got some slides this is why he says i am the vine you are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit here's the simple reality of your life and every problem that you face for without me you can do nothing without me simple truth but it's in bold i wish it was in highlights i wish it was in neon lights i wish i could hold it before my face i wish i could remind you today and have a loud trumpet and remind you children of god without hume you can do nothing i don't care how great you think you are how smart you think you are how eloquent you think you are charismatic without him you're nothing and you can do nothing about it quit trying to figure the problem out without me you may toil you may beg you may plead jesus said but without me you can do nothing unless you abide in me and i in you this is amazing because it was in this this nothingness that the bible starts with when there was just darkness and blackness and void and there was nothing but then the creator's voice spoke to the void and to the darkness he spoke to the deep he spoke to the darkness it was nothing but then he speaks but he spoke and everything changed when he spoke light was replaced darkness was replaced with light he said brother matt what does that mean that means that god you need to ask god and say lord will you speak i've got nothing i've realized i'm nothing i have nothingness there's a void over my life so will you speak lord and if you'll speak if the created voice will speak to my darkness i say lord this morning speak to my darkness speak to my void lord would you say to my trial and my storm let there be light notice what brother branham says here satan could not take them i hope you may not be able to read this very well satan could not take them he could not drown noah in the flood until the purpose of god had been finished he couldn't drowned you he can't drown you until god's finished with you he says he couldn't burn up the hebrew children until the purpose of god had been finished he could not kill job with his boils and troubles until the purpose of god had been finished neither could the lions eat daniel until god's purpose had been finished neither could death and old age take abraham until the purpose of god had been finished and neither can it take you or can it take me how many can raise your hand and say i'll put my name there until the purpose of god has been finished put your faith and no matter what you're facing and it looks like you're drowning and your house is on fire and you're not going to make it until god is finished satan can't take me he can't touch me he can't have me because i'm his and his purpose and his plan i'm part of and so until god has accomplished what he's seen in me the devil can't have me he can't have my children he can't have my home he can't have my mind i give him no place i i cast him out i can't have him he can't whisper he can't speak he can't have me because i'm the lords can you say amen this morning until he has accomplished his purpose so that means he's got a purpose in that storm psalms 107 you don't have to turn but remember the scripture that we read he maketh the stormy winds hello he maketh the stormy winds who crashed paul's boat where did the tempest come from who's the one who decided that both that you've depended upon and that boat that you've put so much trust in i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna destroy it today you know who did that god because the lord had a purpose the lord had a purpose in it all you know what would have happened how they tried to save themselves and try to hold on to the boat and try to just keep making the boat work and keep trying we've got to save it sometimes god intentionally removes something from your life because he doesn't want you to have it anymore and we can become so busy trying to hold on to what god's trying to get us to child let go of it i took it from you because i knew it was best for you and anything that god takes from you god knew god anything god removes from your life let me just say this if god intended for you to have it it would still be in your life he says until he's accomplished the purpose so god had a purpose he has a purpose in causing the stormy wind to raise and i just want to stop and i just want to say something the lord spoke to me and i'm going to say it to you and i believe maybe you'll grab on if you could grab on by faith let me just say this to you as the lord gave it to me that storm those waves that trial that struggle that trial that you're in until god has accomplished his purpose that storm isn't going anywhere you can't pray it away you could try you could want you could want sunshine but when god has you in that for a reason until he's accomplished his purpose in you the storm will continue to rage until god is finished with the purpose of the wave and the flood the waters will still rise but just remember this he has a reason can you say amen he has a purpose why does god that's the message i know brother random speaking on job and why does god let troubles come god harnesses trouble puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with god i know this is simple i know it's simple i know it's elementary but it's just what the lord told me to preach why does god let trouble come god harnesses it puts bits in its mouth makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with god think it not strange when trials no that's not what the bible says think it not strange when fiery trials fiery trials and troubles come think it not strange as these men did when they were at their wits in completely where they had no hope they they had lost all ability they had lost all ability to control the ship and and they were being hit from all sides but let me say this god's not surprised by your ordeal god's not surprised by your struggle it's happening because he wants to produce something in your life and oftentimes it's the answer to a prayer when you pray and you say lord i want to be closer how many have prayed that prayer before i want to be more like jesus has anybody any christians here raise your hand you ever prayed that and said lord i want to be more like you i prayed that prayer prayed it this morning say lord i want to be i want to be more i want to make sure lord that i'm living like you i want to be more like god i want to be how many's ever prayed this lord i want to be drawn closer to you and so god says okay good i'm going to answer that prayer i'm going to draw you closer to me but it's going to come through struggle and through battle and through trial and through testing and through storms and then we say what's happening in my life god says well didn't you pray and you prayed didn't well yes lord yes i i did pray w what did you pray well i prayed to be more like you uh-huh i prayed to be drawn closer to you right are you getting it no lord i don't understand i prayed that and yet i i prayed for more of you i prayed for less of me and now i'll find myself in the midst of a storm and the more of a struggle but it not strange when fiery trials are to try you knowing that that trial of your faith is more precious than gold god says i'm trying to produce something in your heart i want to reveal myself to you and you feel like it's the worst time and the worst storm and it may be financial it may be business it may be family it may be tragedy no matter what it is you you you're the restlessness that you feel and and and as david said and notice what he says here he says uh these men begin to pray and notice no doubt they could say lord how long will i have to go through this how how much more am i going to endure when will god bring us to the desired other side the bible says the sailors come to their wit's end you know that is important one of the first steps needed before god can deliver you out of your marry clay is that you have to give up on yourself until god breaks you of your will he can't help you they came to inability all help we can't save ourselves nobody in this earth in this world in the stars in in this in space under the earth nobody no person no human nobody can get us out of this so what did they do they cried to the lord i believe the lord hears you when you cry you know god can't answer a prayer that you've never prayed and all the while we're asking lord can you answer that you've never even asked him he can't hear a cry for he can't answer your cry of help if you're not crying for help then they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he bringeth them out of their distress he i love this he maketh the storm come only only he can do that only god can speak to a storm only jesus can speak to a storm and say peace be still and then there's a he may get the storm calm so that the waves thereof are still then are they glad because they be quiet so he bringeth them unto their desired haven if you're a child of god if you're a daughter of god a son of god i believe that i am and you say lord i'm praying today whatever it takes lord mold me into the image of your son are you a child of god this morning i believe it are you praying and saying lord i want you to mold me into the image of your son take this clay lord take my family whatever it looks like if you've got to break it down and completely uh crush it and shatter it to rebuild it to your image then are you willing to pray that this morning are you willing with faith to say lord even if it means breaking me down to powder and you have to rebuild me if it means i'm in the image of your son and not the image of my mess that i've made then lord break me down make me into the image of your son make me into the image of what you wanted if that's your prayer today then let me just remind you your battle won't stop your struggle won't cease your trials will continue to come and you'll get out of this one only to go into another one you might make it and you're saying oh if i could ever get out of this if i could ever get killed if i could ever get out of this mess if i could ever get over this hump let me tell you as a child of god what's on the other side of that trial is another trial and what's on the other side of that struggle that you're so perplexed about and so asking god to deliver you let me just tell you what's waiting for you on the other side another trial and another struggle and another valley and another trouble but let me just remind you my dear brother and my sister it's for your perfection it's for your character it's so that you can get out of here because one day i'll come out of my last trial and this body will change and the elements will change and it'll be my last struggle i go through is to change this mortal flesh what are you doing now brother matt trials are coming and what are they doing they're molding me and shaping me and molding me and shaping me and that's what i'm praying for and that's what i'm asking and that's what i'm desiring i want you to shape me and mold me until eventually god decides to change you at the atomic level and it changes you from old to young and from decaying to perfect and from corruption to incorruption he said brother man oh that's got to be we you know friends we put that off in our mind as oh some great big thing way out yonder way off in the distance god somewhere perfect faith and perfect unity and everybody will be in harmony and let me tell you that's what's happening right now through your trials and through your test the body change will not be some massive transportation from your walk with god but the bible says that enoch walked with god he was one day one day the next day the next day and then he was changed and your body change will not be some great transportation it'll just be another day in the life of a believer and the life of trials and tribulations and storms and tests but one day the sun will wake up the sun will shine and it'll be my last test it'll be your last trial it'll be your last struggle and i say lord hasten the day o god let me serve you faithfully today so that i can be found faithful tomorrow he maketh the storm a calm and storms are raging you could be missing let me just say this to you today and i'm just going to close this phil just to stop right there we've been long enough brother matthew if you just come storms will come trials will come but god has the ability only god has the ability as he did for those sailors let's look at it psalms 107 one more time if we could i want you just to put that up on the screen they that go down let's just begin reading that verse 20 5 psalms 107. for he commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind which lifteth up the waves thereof they mount up to the heaven they go down again to the depths their soul is melted because of trouble they reel to and fro and stack her like a drunken man and are at their wit's end and maybe you're at your wit's end then here's what you do they cry unto the lord in their trouble they cry into the lord in their trouble and he bringeth them out of their distress he maketh the storm a calm so that the waves therefore are still maybe today you in your life you just want to say lord i've reached my wit's end i've reached my end of myself could you bear your heads lower with me raise your hands to the lord and say that lord i've reached the end of myself i've reached it lord i've reached wit's end and now i'm crying unto the lord out of my trouble he maketh the storm a calm then are they glad because they be quiet so he bringeth them unto their desired haven i wonder if you could do that today just raise a hand to the lord and say lord would you speak to my storm could you cause a calm could you cause a peace and a calm my heart is jumping leaping and out of rhythm and i'm i just need you to speak lord believe that you can do it you've spoken your word lord jesus i see these hands up i raised my hands this morning lord in this place we don't have music today lord but we do have voices and we lift them up to you right now each in their own way jesus we lift our voices to you lord and we believe your word that you said that you you hear our cry when we cry you hear from heaven and you help we believe that lord jesus now take all these hands all these needs lord jesus i pray would you come would only do what only you can do lord those that are streaming those that are online those that are here present father may you speak lord jesus to our void and our darkness lord because we know when you speak when we hear your voice when we hear that lord that that voice of peace be still then a calm comes over our soul it's a struggle lord this life is about a struggle it's about toil lord but one day we're going to get out of here lord i can hear your prophet yesterday say just on the other side of your last breath is a land that's waiting a city that's prepared loved ones who are rejoicing to welcome you just on the other side of this life is happiness to replace your sadness his joy to replace your sorrow his answers to replace your questions is peace to replace your chaos lord i pray that you'd give us a glimpse of that today each life each hand as we close this service in worship lord we ask it in jesus christ's name gonna sing you a song if you know it you can join if you don't
