[0:00] through this pill.
[0:06] Protect me by thy power
[0:11] and hear
[0:14] my humble plea.
[0:18] Oh Lord,
[0:20] look down on me.
[0:24] When I kneel in prayer, I know I'll meet
[0:28] you there. Oh, blessed Jesus,
[0:32] hold my hand.
[0:37] As I travel through this pilgrim land,
[0:42] there is a friend who walks with me
[0:49] leads me safely through the sinking
[0:53] sand. And it is the Christ of Calary.
[1:01] This would be my prayer, dear Lord, each
[1:05] day to help me do the best I can.
[1:12] For I need thy light to guide me day and
[1:17] night. Oh blessed Jesus,
[1:21] hold my hand.
[1:25] Jesus,
[1:27] hold my hand.
[1:30] I need
[1:33] thee every night
[1:37] through
[1:39] this pilgrim land.
[1:42] Protect me by thy power
[1:48] and hear
[1:51] my humble praise.
[1:54] Oh Lord,
[1:57] look down on me.
[2:00] When I kneel in prayer, I know I'll meet
[2:05] you there. Oh, blessed Jesus,
[2:09] hold my hand.
[2:13] Let me travel in the light divine that I
[2:19] may see the blessed way.
[2:25] Keep me that I may be holy. Dine and
[2:31] sing the redemption
[2:34] song.
[2:37] And I
[2:39] will be a soldier.
[2:44] I'll get it
[2:49] as I onward go and daily meet the flow.
[2:54] Oh blessed Jesus
[2:57] hold my hand.
[3:01] Jesus
[3:03] [Music]
[3:04] hold my hand.
[3:07] I need
[3:09] thee every hour
[3:13] through
[3:15] this pilgrim land.
[3:19] Protect me by thy power
[3:25] and hear
[3:27] my humble praise.
[3:31] Oh Lord,
[3:33] look down on me.
[3:37] When I'm kneel in prayer, I know I'll
[3:41] meet you there. Oh, blessed Jesus,
[3:45] hold my hand.
[3:48] Now, we're going to pause for a minute.
[3:50] You're going to pray and they're going
[3:51] to sing and I'll try to figure it out.
[3:53] All right.
[4:02] the sun.
[4:06] Lead me safely to a heaven.
[4:11] If the crown of life I won.
[4:17] Oh, I have put my faith in thee, dear
[4:22] Lord, that I may reach the golden
[4:27] friend.
[4:29] There is no other friend of whom I can
[4:34] depend. Oh blessed Jesus
[4:37] hold my hand.
[4:41] Jesus
[4:43] hold my hand.
[4:47] I need
[4:49] thee every hour
[4:53] through
[4:55] this pilgrim land.
[4:58] Protect me by thy power
[5:04] and hear
[5:06] my humble way.
[5:10] Oh Lord,
[5:12] look down on me.
[5:16] When I kneel in prayer, I know I'll meet
[5:20] you there. Oh, blessed Jesus, hold my
[5:25] hand.
[5:29] Well, we've only sung that one how many
[5:31] times?
[5:33] All right. All right. It's okay. We just
[5:36] know we want him to hold our hand. Amen.
[5:39] We have a praise here from Sister Melia.
[5:43] She says, "I've been dealing with a
[5:46] coworker that's uh insisted on using
[5:49] Pinesel
[5:51] even after they she was told her not to
[5:53] use it." She says, "It's affected me uh
[5:58] and and given me a headache." Today the
[6:02] problem was resolved by my supervisor.
[6:05] Thank you, Lord Jesus. You know, we all
[6:09] have times and places like that, you
[6:11] know, and instead of getting angry and
[6:13] mad and upset, just commit it to the
[6:16] Lord and he's got a way of doing that.
[6:18] And I found out in the work situation
[6:20] sometimes I'm the one that needed to be
[6:22] straightened out and not the other one.
[6:24] But God knows that. How many knows that
[6:27] to be the truth? Amen. Sometimes that
[6:29] would just say, "Yes, Lord, help us,
[6:31] Lord." Amen. And if you have a need,
[6:34] would raise your hand and say, "Lord,
[6:35] remember me." God knows. God knows it
[6:39] all. So, let's just bow our head as we
[6:40] open. Lord, we thank you this this
[6:43] evening that we can gather
[6:46] in a place, Lord. It's been set aside
[6:48] and Lord, for you to to feel welcome,
[6:51] Lord, and it's not just a place, but
[6:53] it's our attitude. And and Lord, do we
[6:55] make you welcome? And Lord, we want you
[6:57] to just be at be at home here, Lord, and
[7:00] just have your way, Lord, in every part
[7:03] of the service, in the singing, and the
[7:05] worship and hearing the testimony, Lord,
[7:07] and in all the praise, Lord, may you be
[7:09] pleased, Father. Lord, when you are
[7:11] pleased, Lord, and it's a blessing to
[7:13] us, Lord, as your sweetness comes down
[7:15] amongst us, Lord. Lord, any need, any
[7:18] hand that was raised, anybody listening
[7:20] in today that might have a need, Lord,
[7:22] today, would you minister to them as you
[7:25] know how, Lord? Father, in that day that
[7:28] the disciples were were in that room and
[7:31] you had you had passed away. They had
[7:34] seen you crucified. Lord, you just
[7:36] walked in on the room with them and you
[7:38] said, "Peace, be still." Lord, maybe
[7:40] somebody needs to hear that today, Lord.
[7:42] Would you minister to them that way,
[7:44] Lord? In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[7:48] Amen. Amen.
[7:51] It's if that same spirit that raised
[7:55] Christ from the dead
[7:57] dwells in you, it will quicken your
[7:59] body. Amen. What a promise we have.
[8:04] If that same
[8:06] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[8:10] dwells in you,
[8:13] dwells in you.
[8:16] And if that same
[8:19] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[8:23] dwells in you,
[8:26] dwells in you.
[8:29] Oh, it will quicken
[8:32] your mortal body.
[8:36] If that spirit
[8:39] dwells in you,
[8:42] it will quicken
[8:45] your mortal body.
[8:48] If that spirit dwells in you,
[8:54] if that same
[8:57] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[9:01] dwells in you,
[9:04] it dwells in you.
[9:07] If that same
[9:09] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[9:13] dwells in you,
[9:16] it dwells in you.
[9:19] And it will quicken
[9:22] your mortal body.
[9:26] If that spirit
[9:29] dwells in you,
[9:32] it will quicken
[9:35] your mortal body.
[9:38] If that spirit
[9:41] dwells in you, let them play as we clap.
[10:09] Oh, it will quicken
[10:12] your mortal body
[10:16] if that spirit
[10:19] dwells in you,
[10:22] it will quicken
[10:25] your mortal body.
[10:28] If that spirit dwells in you,
[10:34] amen,
[10:36] there is a spirit in you, but let it be
[10:38] the spirit of Christ. That's, you know,
[10:40] he could say to one hanging on the
[10:42] cross, just turn around and look at him
[10:44] and say, "This day you'll be with me in
[10:46] paradise." It doesn't. Sometimes we
[10:48] think I got to do this. I got to get so
[10:50] much. No, just let him dwell in you.
[10:53] That makes it all him. The great
[10:55] emancipator.
[10:58] You know him.
[11:00] Is he close to you? Is he Is he real to
[11:02] you?
[11:04] I know he knows you by name.
[11:07] [Music]
[11:15] Once my heart and soul were fed
[11:23] by the binding chains of sin,
[11:28] [Music]
[11:30] but the great imman
[11:38] set me free to Worship him.
[11:45] It is glory.
[11:47] Glory. Hallelujah.
[11:52] Blessed
[11:54] be his holy name.
[12:00] He's a great demanip.
[12:07] That's the song of the redeemed.
[12:14] Like a lost lamb, I was drifting.
[12:22] Oh, so helpless and alone.
[12:29] But the seeking shepherd found
[12:34] me.
[12:36] Led me to my father's throne.
[12:42] Oh his glory.
[12:45] Glory. Hallelujah.
[12:47] [Applause]
[12:48] [Music]
[12:50] Blessed
[12:52] be his holy name.
[12:58] He's a great immense angel.
[13:05] That's the song of the redeemed. Put
[13:09] that second verse back up there.
[13:12] But the seeking shepherd found me
[13:16] when I didn't even know that I needed
[13:18] him. He was still looking for me. Let's
[13:20] sing that one more time.
[13:23] Like a lost lamb, I was drifting.
[13:29] [Music]
[13:30] Oh, so helpless and alone.
[13:37] But the seeking shepherd found
[13:43] me,
[13:44] led me to my father's home.
[13:50] Oh, it is glory.
[13:53] Glory. Hallelujah.
[13:59] Blessed
[14:01] be his holy name.
[14:06] He's a great emancipator.
[14:13] That's the song of the redeemed.
[14:20] Amen. To him be all honor, all glory,
[14:23] and all praise. You know, it's that he
[14:25] would care for us like he cares for us.
[14:28] Speaking with brother Daniel just a
[14:30] little bit there before service when
[14:32] brother Brandham was up on that that
[14:34] mountain up there and the storm came
[14:36] along
[14:37] and God was having such a good time with
[14:39] him, such a time of fellowship. Brother
[14:42] Brandham's going to turn and go back and
[14:43] he says, "Hey, no, speak to that storm."
[14:47] He said, "Cuz I'm having a wonderful
[14:48] time of fellowship with you and I don't
[14:50] want it interrupted." And that promises
[14:53] to each and every one of us. He says,
[14:55] "Just call upon me." You know, and it
[14:58] just sometimes we we'll we'll put it all
[15:00] on somebody. Well, that person did. No,
[15:02] every one of his children he wants to be
[15:05] with and fellowship with. Amen. Amen.
[15:08] It's the life behind the name.
[15:12] I'm a Christian, but what does my life
[15:15] say?
[15:18] It's the life behind the name
[15:22] that makes a demon tremble.
[15:26] It's the life behind the name
[15:30] that makes the proud heart humble. It
[15:34] was God who devised a plan
[15:37] that in all things as a man
[15:41] he would live so he could give. Give us
[15:46] a life behind the name.
[15:49] It's the life behind the name
[15:53] that makes the demons tremble.
[15:57] It's the life behind the name
[16:01] that makes the proud heart humble. It
[16:05] was God who devised a plan that in all
[16:09] things as a man
[16:12] he would live so he could give us a life
[16:17] behind the name. One more time. It's the
[16:20] life behind the name
[16:24] that makes the demons tremble. It's the
[16:28] life behind the name that makes a proud
[16:33] heart humble. It was God who devised a
[16:37] plan
[16:39] that in all things as a man
[16:42] he would live so he could give give us a
[16:47] life behind the name.
[16:52] You said I'm a Christian. The life
[16:55] testifies if you're a Christian or not.
[16:57] That doesn't make a Christian doesn't
[16:59] make you unhuman.
[17:01] You're still human.
[17:03] But Christ in us gives us the overcoming
[17:05] power. The one that says, "I'm sorry."
[17:08] The one that says, "It was my fault."
[17:11] And then you can go on with him. Amen.
[17:16] It's the mercy of God that rewrote my
[17:18] life.
[17:19] How many can testify with that? I didn't
[17:22] deserve anything. But he said, "Hey,
[17:26] mercy
[17:29] re
[17:31] my life.
[17:36] Mercy
[17:39] re
[17:41] my love.
[17:46] I should have fallen.
[17:50] My soul
[17:53] cast down.
[17:55] God's mercy
[17:58] rerote
[18:00] my life.
[18:05] Mercy
[18:08] rerote
[18:10] my love.
[18:15] Mercy
[18:17] ree
[18:19] my love.
[18:24] I sure have fallen
[18:28] my soul.
[18:30] Cast down
[18:33] God's mercy
[18:36] reward
[18:38] with arms lifted up in praise. Let's
[18:40] sing that one to him.
[18:43] Mercy
[18:45] rule
[18:47] my love.
[18:51] [Music]
[18:52] Mercy
[18:54] rule
[18:56] my love.
[19:01] My sh have fallen. My soul
[19:07] cast down.
[19:09] God's mercy
[19:12] reun
[19:14] my life.
[19:19] Amen. It was his mercy. Sometimes I look
[19:23] back and I say, "Lord, why
[19:26] why did you why did you you know, I
[19:28] probably should have lost my life then.
[19:30] I should have got in trouble, but your
[19:32] mercy reached down and said, "Now you're
[19:34] my son. You're my daughter." Amen.
[19:37] and I know he has forgiven me.
[19:42] There's no question on the forgiveness
[19:44] of God. The issue is can we receive it?
[19:48] Can we accept it? But Lord, I've got to
[19:51] do this to earn your grace. Lord, I got
[19:53] to do this to No, no, no. He has
[19:56] forgiven you. Amen.
[20:03] He
[20:05] has
[20:07] forave
[20:10] me.
[20:12] My sins have been washed from his memory
[20:20] by the blood of the lamb
[20:24] of Calary.
[20:29] He
[20:30] has
[20:32] forgiven
[20:34] me.
[20:36] He
[20:38] has forgiven
[20:42] me.
[20:43] My sins have been washed from his memory
[20:51] by the blood of the lamb
[20:55] of Calary.
[20:59] he
[21:01] had for you. Let the sisters sing this.
[21:10] [Music]
[21:35] Okay, brothers, he
[21:39] has
[21:40] for
[21:42] me.
[21:44] My sins have been washed from his
[21:48] memory.
[21:51] By the blood of the lamb
[21:55] of Calary,
[21:59] he

[22:13] My sins have been washed by his mey
[22:19] [Music]
[22:20] by the blood of the lamb
[22:24] of Cal
[22:32] for
[22:34] me.
[22:37] Now you have to set it aside.
[22:40] You have to say, "It's been put under
[22:42] the blood. It's not mine anymore. It's
[22:45] been taken away." Amen.
[22:48] And you know when he has forgiven you,
[22:51] you can come into his presence in the
[22:53] presence of Jehovah.

[25:44] earth and then one day soon Lord come
[25:48] into your presence in the fullness
[25:51] and Lord spend an eternity there just
[25:54] praising God and worshiping you.
[25:58] Lord we pray that you'd be with us
[25:59] tonight. May your hand be upon the
[26:02] service. Bless the testimony Lord we
[26:05] pray. Be with us Lord we ask in Jesus
[26:08] name. Amen. Amen. You can be seated. God
[26:12] bless you.
[26:15] We have a um we have a new policy in
[26:18] church. I wanted to mention it to the
[26:19] congregation. If you are not paying
[26:21] attention, you have to come up and sit
[26:23] in one of these three chairs.
[26:29] You think I'm kidding?
[26:33] We're gonna have a testimony tonight.
[26:35] And uh and brother Jordan, I told sister
[26:37] Shirley when I put them out there, I
[26:38] said, "You have to sit right here." Um
[26:41] we will uh Brother Jordan and I and
[26:44] Brother Kenny Phillips are going to give
[26:47] testimony tonight. We look forward to
[26:49] having you up here, Brother Kenny. A
[26:51] great man of God, someone that has done
[26:55] so much for this church and so much for
[26:56] so many of us. Before we get started,
[26:59] uh, I wanted to say a few things about
[27:03] why these testimonies are important.
[27:07] Brother Aaron
[27:09] talked about brother Brandham up in the
[27:11] mountain and how the storm was spoken
[27:16] away and and brother Brandham God said,
[27:19] "No, no, come come come back up here and
[27:22] won't you walk with me for a while?"
[27:25] Both of my grandfathers were with him up
[27:28] there during that time. Both my grandpa
[27:32] Evans was not too far from him at that
[27:35] moment and then my grandpa Wheeler was
[27:37] down at the bottom of the mountain. Both
[27:39] witnessed that testimony.
[27:42] And let me uh let's
[27:46] No, no service is complete without
[27:48] reading the word of God. So let me let
[27:51] me read out of uh the 24th chapter, the
[27:55] last chapter of the book of Joshua
[27:58] and then say a few words about this
[28:00] before we get into the testimony. Let's
[28:03] start with verse number 29. Joshua
[28:06] chapter 24
[28:08] verse number 29.
[28:11] And I believe this is exactly
[28:14] what we're doing here today,
[28:16] especially verse number 31.
[28:20] But uh verse number 29 it reads like
[28:22] this. And it came to pass
[28:25] after these things that Joshua the son
[28:26] of Nun the servant of the Lord died
[28:29] being 110 years old. And they buried him
[28:32] in the border of his inheritance
[28:35] in Timnas
[28:37] which is in the mount of Ephraim on the
[28:40] north side of the hill of Gash. Now
[28:43] listen to this.
[28:45] And Israel served the Lord all the days
[28:49] of Joshua,
[28:51] and all the days of the elders that
[28:54] overlived Joshua,
[28:56] and which had known all the works of the
[28:59] Lord that he had done for Israel.
[29:05] Very telling scripture.
[29:10] Joshua
[29:12] had brought. So, the ones that came out
[29:16] of Egypt with Moses, they all died in
[29:19] the wilderness. They didn't believe
[29:22] strong enough. But there rose up another
[29:25] generation
[29:27] from that group that came out um of
[29:31] Egypt under Moses. They ro they they
[29:35] were raised up under Moses and under
[29:37] Joshua. And they were born in the
[29:39] wilderness.
[29:40] They went over the Jordan River
[29:45] and they went to battle in Canaan's
[29:48] land. And that is who Joshua is talking
[29:51] about here. Who this book of Joshua is
[29:53] talking about is those ones that
[29:55] witnessed these miracles. They're the
[29:58] ones
[30:00] that they may have been a little kid,
[30:03] but they witnessed the mana falling from
[30:06] heaven.
[30:08] They witnessed the quail coming in to
[30:10] the camp and their parents gathering up
[30:13] this these quail. They they they
[30:16] remembered being thirsty in the
[30:18] wilderness and and Moses bringing the
[30:21] water from the rock. These people
[30:25] remembered going up to the Jordan River
[30:29] and the river was swollen and they
[30:33] remember the water drying up and
[30:36] marching over the river and then going
[30:39] up to the to the city of Jericho
[30:42] and marching around that city and then
[30:46] the walls came down. They remembered
[30:49] that. They remembered
[30:53] the sons standing still as they fought
[30:57] the battle. These are the ones that
[31:00] remembered those things. And then those
[31:02] brothers and sisters, they told their
[31:06] children these stories. And then Joshua
[31:09] tells I I mentioned it I believe last
[31:12] Sunday. Joshua says after they went over
[31:15] the the Jordan River, Joshua says, "Pick
[31:17] up these stones and lay them down at
[31:20] this city of Gilgal. And then when your
[31:22] children come back and your children's
[31:24] children come back to these stones, tell
[31:27] them the story of going over the Jordan
[31:30] River, tell them these stories. Can you
[31:33] imagine sitting around and maybe SMA
[31:39] Solomon and Rahab his wife, the general
[31:43] and Joshua's army and this little lady
[31:47] that had her house up on the walls of
[31:51] Jericho. Can you rem can you imagine
[31:54] them with their children around and
[31:57] Rahab telling the story of how she lived
[32:01] on the walls and how powerful these
[32:04] walls were and Solomon saying that yeah
[32:08] we marched around this city seven times
[32:13] and then on the on the seventh day we
[32:17] marched around seven times and we blew
[32:19] the trumpets and we shouted and the
[32:21] walls came down and I led this battle in
[32:25] into this city and we killed man, woman
[32:29] and child. But there up on them up on
[32:32] the wall there was this red rope hanging
[32:37] down and I had been instructed,
[32:40] do not touch that house or you will die,
[32:43] Solomon. Do you understand me? Yes, sir.
[32:46] We won't touch that house.
[32:49] son, that was the house that your mom
[32:51] lived in.
[32:53] That was the house that your grandma
[32:54] lived in. That was the house that your
[32:57] aunts and your uncles lived in was that
[33:00] house. Can you imagine hearing those
[33:03] stories and those are the stories that
[33:05] that here it says that that they passed
[33:08] these stories along. They they they told
[33:11] these stories, this oral tradition
[33:15] for the Jews.
[33:17] They encouraged their children with
[33:21] these stories. I tell stories about my
[33:24] grandfather, both of my grandfathers,
[33:28] about how Brother Brandham and the great
[33:30] miracles that went on and and the the
[33:32] prayer lines and and the discernment and
[33:36] and the
[33:38] seven church ages on the wall. And I I
[33:43] reiterate these stories that were told
[33:45] to me by my parents who were there. And
[33:46] I've told my children
[33:49] and I want
[33:51] my children,
[33:53] Daniel and Meline, I want them to tell
[33:57] stories to their children about this
[34:00] church
[34:02] about this is what happened.
[34:05] This is who your grandpa was. This these
[34:08] are the things that happened in the
[34:11] church that that we move back home to
[34:14] Tucson and the miracles that happened
[34:16] there. That's what I want my children to
[34:20] tell their children and their children
[34:22] to tell their children. I don't want
[34:25] these miracles to stop. I want them to
[34:28] continue on. Can you imagine this the
[34:31] the testimonies that were told? Maybe
[34:33] they had a group like this and they had
[34:36] maybe
[34:38] uh one of Joshua's generals and and his
[34:40] his wife and and maybe the the priests
[34:43] in the church and they were interviewing
[34:45] and and the children were listening and
[34:47] it gave them strength. But there was a
[34:50] time
[34:51] that those people died out
[34:56] and the generations after them, they
[34:59] didn't want to serve God anymore.
[35:02] They didn't care about these testimonies
[35:05] about about these stories from maybe a
[35:08] couple generations ago when Joshua, this
[35:10] great prophet, had done these great
[35:12] things. They didn't really care about
[35:14] those things anymore. There was too much
[35:16] in the world going on now that it wasn't
[35:19] important to them.
[35:21] And it says here, "And Israel served the
[35:24] Lord all the days of Joshua and all the
[35:26] days of the elders that outlived Joshua
[35:30] and which had known all the works of the
[35:32] Lord that he had done for for Israel.
[35:37] We are living in that generation now
[35:40] where we see
[35:43] and it's not just brother Brandham. It
[35:45] is this revival that happened. It
[35:48] started in Isuza Street with the with
[35:50] the Pentecostal revival and it went on
[35:53] and and brother Brandham was just he was
[35:55] the most powerful of all of them. But
[35:58] people
[36:00] were praying all night.
[36:03] What a foreign thing today.
[36:06] What what a strange thing. They weren't
[36:09] back then. They didn't even have a
[36:11] television.
[36:12] And we heard we've heard brother
[36:14] Brandham and and really all of the old
[36:18] ministers back in the 40s and 50s and
[36:21] 60s preaching against this thing called
[36:23] a television. If they would have known
[36:27] what it led to and what it is today
[36:31] when it's not coming home from school
[36:34] and spending a couple hours with your
[36:37] family
[36:38] watching something that isn't so bad.
[36:42] They were preaching against that.
[36:45] Now it's all day long
[36:49] looking at things that who knows what.
[36:51] Ungodly things. one thing after the next
[36:54] after the next. And there was a
[36:56] generation with Joshua after Joshua,
[36:59] they simply didn't care.
[37:02] And they didn't want God anymore.
[37:06] They didn't think he was important.
[37:08] Maybe that we are so scientific now and
[37:11] and we are so understanding now that
[37:13] those things, you know, they really
[37:15] didn't happen.
[37:17] They they they really weren't true.
[37:20] And there's still those there now that
[37:23] are alive now that says, "No, they
[37:26] happened. They were true. I was there."
[37:31] And the same with Joshua. There were
[37:33] those that said, "No, I was there when
[37:37] that river dried up. I was there when
[37:41] the walls of Jericho, and it's a cursed
[37:44] city now, but I was there when that was
[37:46] a great city, and those walls fell down.
[37:51] I was there when that sun I was fighting
[37:55] the battle when that sun was going down
[37:59] and we were routing the enemy and and we
[38:02] knew that if they just got into the
[38:04] woods and they just got away and
[38:06] darkness fell that they would regroup
[38:08] and come against us and I was there when
[38:11] Joshua looked and that sun stood still
[38:14] and he commanded it you don't move and
[38:18] it didn't move and they routed the
[38:20] armies. There were those that tell these
[38:22] stories that says, "I was there. I don't
[38:26] care what you say. I don't care how you
[38:29] can prove it's not true. It doesn't
[38:31] matter. I was there." And that's what I
[38:34] grew up with. And that's what many of us
[38:36] grew up hearing those stories. And we
[38:38] have an opportunity today. And the most
[38:41] important thing that we're going to hear
[38:42] to me today, Brother Phillips, is not
[38:46] necessarily the miracles, not
[38:48] necessarily the meetings,
[38:52] but the thing that I have heard from
[38:54] your testimony that you told me is the
[38:57] sincerity of your heart and the praying
[39:01] and all the time that used to be spent
[39:04] in the things of God and the things that
[39:07] and those things just simply are almost
[39:09] a thing of the pass now in these days.
[39:13] So, I'm looking forward to hearing this
[39:15] testimony. I've been excited all day.
[39:17] Brother I I was twisting brother
[39:20] Jordan's arm and I was saying you twist
[39:22] his arm and do anything you can to get
[39:26] him up here because I want to hear it
[39:29] because I knew that it would be a
[39:31] blessing to everyone here and everyone
[39:33] that's online. So, Brother Jordan, if
[39:35] you could come and brother Philip will
[39:37] uh Brother Jordan and I will will sit on
[39:39] either side. I'm hoping that
[39:42] um Brother Jordan knows the testimony,
[39:45] so he'll be prompting
[39:47] um Brother Phillips, but
[39:52] we got to talking,
[39:54] Brother Phillips, Brother Kenny and I a
[39:56] couple days ago, and he didn't need any
[40:00] prompting. He was firm with his
[40:02] testimony and I could tell that this
[40:05] brother just loves the Lord with all of
[40:06] his heart.
[40:24] So, Brother Kenny Phillips, if you don't
[40:26] know him,
[40:28] he is Brother Jordan's grandpa.
[40:31] Sister Rachel's dad.
[40:35] And uh how long have you been here,
[40:38] Brother Phillips? How long have you been
[40:40] part of this church?
[40:42] You moved here in January of 66 to 29th,
[40:47] just um month after brother Ben passed
[40:50] away.
[40:52] And we would have come quicker, but we
[40:54] were working to try to save enough money
[40:56] to travel on. And we got here. I
[41:00] remember Donna telling me, um,
[41:04] we can rent. We went and looked at the
[41:06] house. She said, we can rent this if
[41:08] it's don't exceed 105 because that's
[41:11] what we was paying over there. 105,000.
[41:14] Yeah. And so
[41:16] Mr. Graph, he turned around and asked
[41:19] him, "How much would you like to have?"
[41:22] He said, "At least 105."
[41:26] And that was okay. You know, that was
[41:30] the start of it back in ' 66
[41:34] and I met a lot of wonderful people in
[41:37] that time. I know brother Evans is
[41:41] talking about his grandpa's and
[41:45] he whe you know it or not, he's royal
[41:47] blood
[41:49] not just from the Abraham from this life
[41:53] but he's in the other life too.
[41:56] But I knew brother
[42:02] I knew brother
[42:04] um Evans
[42:07] had some wonderful talks with him
[42:10] setting I was doing the job up behind
[42:12] the lakes up there for your dad for
[42:14] Wayne
[42:16] and I was pouring a lot of concrete we
[42:18] building bridges and that brother Evans
[42:22] come up every day and he'd sit up under
[42:24] oak tree and I'd go up
[42:26] spend an hour with him and just
[42:28] wonderful testimonies
[42:30] and then brother Wheeler just talking to
[42:33] him through time it just had such
[42:36] wonderful testimonies and God gave me
[42:39] the privilege to meet a lot of God's
[42:42] people and brother Connley
[42:47] brother Connley told me one time he said
[42:50] you know he said brother Bam told him
[42:52] you need to pray every night Lord
[42:54] forgive me my sins sins and forgive me
[42:57] of the things I did. I don't know I did
[43:00] before you go to bed. And that was it's
[43:03] always been with me from then. And I'm
[43:06] very nervous you guys. So forgive me.
[43:10] Uh so
[43:13] I had I knew brother Norman and and
[43:19] brother Sman and and they were wonderful
[43:22] people. They had some wonderful
[43:24] testimonies of what happened in their
[43:27] life. And I'm not
[43:31] I hope I get this straight to you. I I
[43:34] know that they enjoyed being around
[43:37] brother Brandham. And I've often
[43:39] wondered just what you was talking about
[43:41] while ago, those that around Joshua,
[43:45] were they close? Did they really realize
[43:48] what they were looking at or they just
[43:51] went over them? But these brothers had
[43:54] wonderful testimonies and God let me
[43:58] know them lot. I built a house for
[44:00] brother Hickerson and just was able to
[44:03] talk to a lot of God's wonderful people.
[44:07] I've brother Brandham
[44:10] I was in about maybe eight to 10
[44:15] meetings around vice tar in Oakland
[44:20] and uh in LA
[44:23] but
[44:25] I heard what he preached but in the
[44:29] first pool and second pool it was
[44:33] throwing the line out to catch the fish
[44:35] you know and the third pool's really the
[44:37] word of God. And so the
[44:41] uh I enjoyed the healings and stuff and
[44:45] I guess that's what I was looking at.
[44:48] And then now I go back and hear that
[44:50] same tape. I kind of doubt myself was I
[44:52] there or not because there's so much
[44:54] more in it, you know. And so
[44:59] and I've heard tapes, you know, from
[45:02] that time on.
[45:05] in Oakland. I went there and when I was
[45:08] about just 17, maybe 18, right close to
[45:12] there.
[45:13] And uh I went to brother B meetings and
[45:17] I knew he was a prophet.
[45:20] And from that time up to about 61,
[45:23] I realized he I still believed he was a
[45:26] prophet, but I didn't realize what a
[45:28] word prophet was. And it came and it I
[45:33] looked at it no different than Moses and
[45:35] the others. God chose a man to get us
[45:40] back on what Apostle Paul said. And
[45:43] you'll never find nothing in brother
[45:46] Brown's message that he didn't bring it
[45:49] from the Bible. He really pushed to go
[45:52] back to the Bible to read it and to pray
[45:54] and and I think very true. But you can't
[45:59] really keep a straight path unless you
[46:03] consider what he said because there's
[46:07] I don't know how many thousands of
[46:09] churches and they all claim to believe
[46:12] and go back to the Bible but yet some
[46:16] reason it's not getting to them. They
[46:19] didn't see what was for their hour. The
[46:22] same as brother Evans said the other day
[46:25] Sunday there when he was talking about
[46:27] Jesus
[46:28] and in the priests brother Ram said was
[46:31] righteous people good people and they
[46:35] wanted to do what Moses told them to do
[46:37] and they couldn't see the disposition
[46:39] changing
[46:40] and and Jesus you know and John the
[46:44] Baptist kind of changed over then the
[46:47] apostles received the Holy Ghost and
[46:49] things changed.
[46:51] So that's kind of where I stand on
[46:55] what I really believe. And I came to the
[46:59] Lord in when I was 17
[47:02] in January of
[47:05] January 26, 1954. So it's been what 70
[47:10] 71 years.
[47:12] And I had 11 nights I went to the altar
[47:18] seeking the Lord for
[47:21] um the baptism of the Holy Ghost back
[47:24] under Pentecostal time.
[47:27] And then
[47:30] brother Lex Roberts to I don't know if
[47:32] any y'all know him when he was here a
[47:36] few but his dad brother Roberts baptized
[47:41] me in in February the 28th of 1954
[47:48] and we um but his dad was a man that
[47:53] really a Pentecostal
[47:56] one. He was born 1800 sometime. I don't
[47:59] know just how old up and they beat him
[48:00] with that and rocks and left him for
[48:04] dead and he survived it
[48:08] and
[48:12] so he was a real man of God.
[48:15] But in the way I went came to the Lord
[48:19] back then I started seeking for the Holy
[48:21] Ghost and took me 11 nights to say what
[48:25] I should have said the first night
[48:28] and I I didn't and I felt God's presence
[48:31] every night I was praying. I remember
[48:34] once I thought somebody was around me,
[48:37] had their hands up and I could feel the
[48:38] heat from their hands and all and then
[48:43] found out there was nobody there, you
[48:46] know, just and
[48:50] uh so the Lord always moved in and
[48:52] helped me help me, you know, did
[48:54] wonderful things during those 11 nights
[48:56] of seeking. But when I finally come to
[48:59] the point of receiving the Holy Ghost, I
[49:02] said, "Lord," I said, I remember it very
[49:04] clearly. I did all I can do. I told you
[49:08] I'd live for you. I'd believe your word.
[49:11] Whatever you showed me, I'd believe it.
[49:14] And I'll live it, Lord. And and uh I've
[49:19] did it all that I can do. And I want you
[49:21] to help me. And I received the Holy
[49:24] Ghost right then. Thank you, Lord.
[49:26] But
[49:28] I had to come to a place that I totally
[49:31] surrendered myself to the Lord.
[49:34] You know, I just uh
[49:37] believe that was when I the Lord really
[49:40] spoke and we sought for tongues back
[49:43] then. And I did speak in tongues in
[49:46] about 45 minutes to an hour. I couldn't
[49:51] everything come out. I couldn't control
[49:53] it. And my aunt Rosie, I remember her.
[49:58] She's up in age, old grandma like, you
[50:00] know, with the dress and the aprons and
[50:03] whatever she wore. But she uh come and
[50:06] ask me a question.
[50:08] And
[50:11] I would tell her, you know, but she
[50:14] couldn't understand me. And she'd just
[50:16] dance around in a circle and come back
[50:20] and she said, "Now tell me this." you
[50:23] know, then here she'd go again, you
[50:25] know,
[50:27] and I guess I got home for just a little
[50:31] while at home and then I could
[50:34] just seemed like my tongue swelling went
[50:37] out of it, whatever it was, and I I
[50:39] could uh talk to people,
[50:43] but that was my experience receiving the
[50:45] Holy Ghost. Amen. I got I got hurt in
[50:49] high school playing football and I lost
[50:52] my sense of balance and I spent about
[50:55] six months in bed and everything spun so
[50:58] fast kind of a diagonal that I couldn't
[51:02] walk when I went like the rest of me
[51:05] where I'd have to hold the walls or
[51:06] somebody would have to help me. I
[51:09] couldn't couldn't make it. And then I'
[51:12] if I laid on the bed and just turn my
[51:14] head a certain way, it quit. But I
[51:17] couldn't turn my eyes or turn my head
[51:18] very fast. And I was taking 21 pills. I
[51:22] know back then. And three of them was
[51:25] enough for an adult to where I could
[51:27] even walk. And I got where I go to
[51:30] school, but it was all in slow motion. I
[51:33] couldn't turn fast, you know. I couldn't
[51:35] do anything. But the first night I went
[51:37] to the altar of the Lord instantly.
[51:45] I never have been bothered with it
[51:47] again.
[51:49] It's just what the Lord did for me. I
[51:52] just thank the Lord
[51:54] and that through time I've received a
[51:57] lot of instant healing from the Lord.
[52:00] And there've been some lingered for a
[52:02] while, but the Lord's always been good
[52:04] to me. and and I'm made a lot of
[52:09] mistakes in life and God forgave me. But
[52:13] yet I
[52:15] never one time thought about turning
[52:17] back. I'd always and and I know
[52:22] I know that if you God's able to forgive
[52:25] you of anything
[52:27] and but yet you got to come to it
[52:30] believing that he will do it and he's
[52:32] able to do it. And that's the same way
[52:36] receiving healing or the Holy Ghost
[52:39] strengthening. You got to realize he
[52:42] died for me even though you'll never be
[52:44] worthy. We're only going to make it by
[52:47] his grace that we're going to make it
[52:49] in.
[52:51] And that's uh
[52:55] sort of part of it. I through the time
[52:59] of work and
[53:01] when I came to Tucson, there was a whole
[53:03] lot of brothers out of work and the
[53:06] church down there was a full church once
[53:09] we they got going and I worked I started
[53:13] my own company and I I had record of
[53:18] over a hundred brothers I worked people
[53:20] that went to church and and brother
[53:24] George Gladwell and brother
[53:27] Roberts
[53:29] uh worked for me. Ben Brian worked with
[53:32] me and I worked quite a bit with Ben.
[53:35] And it was just
[53:39] the Lord helped me and was able to hire
[53:42] a lot of them. And there were times that
[53:46] Friday night I didn't have the payroll,
[53:49] but I would write out the checks, give
[53:51] it to them. By Monday morning, I had the
[53:54] funds to cover it. You know, this
[53:59] the Lord helping
[54:02] Thursday
[54:05] in uh California, you told or when you
[54:08] were there and you first got saved, you
[54:11] would tell us a story about you going
[54:12] into the corn fields and praying.
[54:15] Well, I always went out in the field at
[54:18] night,
[54:19] brother, um, in his alpha alpha field
[54:24] and I' I'd go out there and pray. I
[54:26] remember the moon and the stars and and
[54:30] I was probably 18 or getting close to 19
[54:35] then. And I'd look up at it and I said,
[54:38] "Lord, somewhere there's a a lady, a
[54:42] young girl that you've raised.
[54:46] Just help me to meet her." And let her
[54:50] be full of the Holy Ghost.
[54:53] And God did do that. I married an angel.
[54:58] Really?
[55:06] Go ahead.
[55:08] The other story I was thinking you could
[55:11] share was when you were you were talking
[55:14] the last couple days or with your sister
[55:16] and your brother about Lily Qualls, your
[55:20] oldest older sister and your mom and
[55:24] your other sister in brother Brandham's
[55:26] meetings. Yeah, they Lily was playing
[55:29] the piano for brother Brandham and she
[55:31] told brother Billy
[55:34] uh Paul to have brother Brandham pray
[55:37] for her and so he prayed for a whole
[55:41] prayer line and everybody and he she
[55:45] thought he was leaving the platform and
[55:48] he was and then he just spun around. He
[55:52] said, "Uh,
[55:54] you for I mean you thought that I forgot
[55:57] about you, but I didn't."
[56:01] And she got what she needed. And then
[56:04] what he was talking my sister Lily in
[56:07] Oakland, Brother called her out and told
[56:11] her we just changed address. We didn't
[56:13] move that they came through and changed
[56:15] addresses two days before.
[56:18] And when he told her where she lived, he
[56:20] gave the right address.
[56:24] And and
[56:26] so mom and my sister Lorraine
[56:30] uh they were in the meeting in
[56:33] Bakersville.
[56:35] Brother Brandon was praying for
[56:37] different ones down there and he prayed
[56:39] for mom
[56:41] and uh and the next night they come back
[56:45] and the first one they prayed for is
[56:47] Lorraine. He just
[56:51] sort of like he picked up and went on
[56:53] you know that was a big blessing too.
[56:59] So
[57:03] I think there was um
[57:07] one thing a little detail I'll share
[57:08] there. The first meetings you were in
[57:10] Oakland. Yeah. Dad's dad my grandpa on
[57:14] the other side. So this is my grandpa on
[57:15] my mom's side. my grandpa on my dad's
[57:17] side with brother Johnson had dad would
[57:20] know this maybe better but brother
[57:22] Johnson had sponsored those meetings in
[57:24] Oakland that his family was going to
[57:27] there in Oakland so it was kind of
[57:30] interesting they were in the same
[57:31] services but didn't know each other for
[57:33] many years till years later
[57:36] um
[57:38] there was I was trying to think if there
[57:40] was one other story there you had shared
[57:42] oh uncle Bud was going down and your
[57:45] your younger brother there to the la was
[57:48] it the second the last service brother
[57:50] for the Brandham's there leadership was
[57:52] it coina I believe it was that
[57:55] leadership yeah and we started to go
[58:00] down and I and we and we'd been we lived
[58:03] in Moore Park not was right at the edge
[58:06] of LA
[58:08] but you start to 17 18 million people
[58:12] you can look a long ways to find we
[58:15] wouldn't sure where we were going, the
[58:17] address. I know we'd been down to the uh
[58:21] downtown there to the hotel that better
[58:23] preached from and the uh the hall they
[58:26] preached there too and and I but we
[58:31] started and got about an hour away from
[58:34] home and getting clo you know getting
[58:37] down maybe 45 minutes
[58:41] but I Don and I got to talking and we
[58:44] decided we really didn't know where we
[58:47] were going and we wouldn't probably we
[58:51] never found the place and we were
[58:53] running late to get there anyway.
[58:57] And so
[58:59] I told her, I said, "Well," I said, "We
[59:02] get the tapes
[59:04] and and the word is always number one."
[59:09] And and I felt something move into the
[59:14] car.
[59:17] Can you imagine going to church but not
[59:20] knowing where the service was? So you
[59:21] drive an hour and then trying to find
[59:24] think about that's where you're going to
[59:25] go. We barely go to church and we know
[59:27] what time it is and where it is, but you
[59:29] know, wanting to go to service. Yeah. I
[59:33] think that's all the main ones I was
[59:35] thinking of today. Did you have anything
[59:37] else, grandpa or mom, you thought he
[59:39] should share? No, it one thing I just
[59:43] thinking of through time the Lord has
[59:45] helped me and I I worked run a job for a
[59:49] guy in uh Gailsburg. That's how come we
[59:53] moved to Gellsburg, Illinois.
[59:55] And so I run his work for 25 years. I
[59:59] built for him before nursing homes and
[1:00:01] things. Then and Fred passed away in the
[1:00:04] office. So I started doing his running
[1:00:07] it for him. And we do from one to seven
[1:00:12] big buildings a year. And just real
[1:00:15] busy. And there was two guys I was
[1:00:18] working with. wonder if you know I got
[1:00:20] along fine with them but they were
[1:00:22] telling Don things that it wasn't true
[1:00:27] you know about me or anything and I
[1:00:30] didn't know where to go in front or not
[1:00:32] and I was walking across the driveway
[1:00:34] and
[1:00:36] and
[1:00:38] something just spoke to me inside it
[1:00:40] wasn't an audible voice but it it was
[1:00:42] real voice inside of me said you haven't
[1:00:45] seen me
[1:00:47] see you haven't seen me at battle yet?
[1:00:51] And I said, "Yes, Lord." In two weeks
[1:00:54] they were both both fired,
[1:01:02] testimony sister Ameilia gave earlier
[1:01:04] about the pine saw. And I prayed for
[1:01:07] him. I didn't have nothing against them.
[1:01:11] And I pray that I become like brother
[1:01:13] Brandham. You couldn't tell my enemies
[1:01:15] from my friends.
[1:01:18] And never never draw lines and draw
[1:01:21] people out because you don't
[1:01:24] I'm just telling you what I do now. And
[1:01:27] I I
[1:01:29] do believe you know I I think of brother
[1:01:32] Brandham and some of the brothers call
[1:01:34] them the children out there Rick Edetas
[1:01:37] and Ricky's or whatever he called it
[1:01:40] Elvis's. But anyway, the Lord told him
[1:01:44] not to do that because some of those
[1:01:47] children was his seed.
[1:01:49] And so you may be saying something about
[1:01:52] somebody next to you that don't really,
[1:01:56] you know, live a a good life, you know,
[1:01:59] that you think cuz everybody's right in
[1:02:02] their own eyes and they want everybody
[1:02:05] to see it like they do.
[1:02:07] But you can't be that way. you got to
[1:02:10] recognize and and and honor what they do
[1:02:14] believe. You know, you can't just
[1:02:16] condemn anyone over it.
[1:02:19] And I So I always that's kind of my
[1:02:22] standard. And I know in the message when
[1:02:25] you start drawing lines, you're actually
[1:02:29] they build little clicks of their own
[1:02:32] and they come up with an organizational
[1:02:34] spirit, you know. And I I and I can't
[1:02:37] really say that about them.
[1:02:40] But the all the things from brother
[1:02:43] Brandham and their traditions
[1:02:46] and then the what they believe and
[1:02:49] people against you, we draw you out. You
[1:02:52] know, they're not part of it. And so I
[1:02:56] just uh I never was that way.
[1:02:59] Everybody's
[1:03:01] pray.
[1:03:03] I've got 18 grandkids
[1:03:07] and some of my you know the ones that's
[1:03:09] married the husbands too and then I got
[1:03:12] about maybe 21 23 great grandkids
[1:03:17] and all of them are living for the Lord
[1:03:19] that I know of.
[1:03:21] And that's
[1:03:23] that's
[1:03:29] my middle daughter couldn't have
[1:03:31] children. She adopted one boy and he uh
[1:03:36] not he's not living for the Lord but
[1:03:39] after she adopted them then it wasn't
[1:03:41] too long she's had
[1:03:44] some of her own four of them and then uh
[1:03:50] Martin when he comes over to visit them
[1:03:55] if he's got a girlfriend he makes her
[1:03:57] wear a dress he won't let her come and
[1:04:01] they give him money for any reason, he
[1:04:04] won't let him spend it on anything like
[1:04:07] cigarettes or drinks or anything like
[1:04:09] that. It's holy money to him. And I and
[1:04:14] he really honors his mom and dad, you
[1:04:16] know, adopted ones. And so I think the
[1:04:19] Lord will reward him for that down the
[1:04:22] road.
[1:04:24] Share what the Lord did for you this
[1:04:26] past November or December. this past
[1:04:28] November or December, what was it the
[1:04:30] Lord did for you with your heart? Share
[1:04:33] that. Oh,
[1:04:35] yeah. In November,
[1:04:38] I was fixing to fly out here.
[1:04:41] I think it's 17th of of November last
[1:04:44] year.
[1:04:46] I was uh it was a Saturday night, the
[1:04:49] next morning, Sunday, was supposed to
[1:04:51] fly to Tucson.
[1:04:53] And it was about 7 o'clock.
[1:04:56] And I was telling my son-in-law and
[1:04:58] brother
[1:05:00] uh Sanger and David Sanger, I hope some
[1:05:03] of y'all probably know him, pastor
[1:05:06] there. He's uh and there was two other
[1:05:09] brothers there.
[1:05:11] And I was telling them how to that I
[1:05:14] would put in a sopet and other things
[1:05:16] and and and
[1:05:19] John looked at me and he said, "Uh,
[1:05:22] what you know," he said, "Do you feel
[1:05:24] all right?" And I said, "No.
[1:05:26] And that's all I remember. And they
[1:05:29] caught me with a slumping
[1:05:32] and my uh
[1:05:35] he couldn't get a pulse or anything. And
[1:05:38] amulets were coming and then I get uh
[1:05:43] next thing I remember there was lights
[1:05:45] kind of flashing in there and you know
[1:05:49] it just be real bright then kind of just
[1:05:52] fade away then real bright and go away.
[1:05:54] you know, and that's the only thing I
[1:05:56] remember when I was there. And I uh they
[1:06:01] said, "My eyes are rolling back and when
[1:06:04] you die, all your bowels move too."
[1:06:08] And all that happened. And then I heard
[1:06:12] John in the distance say, that's my
[1:06:14] son-in-law
[1:06:16] say that uh I can't get a pulse.
[1:06:20] And then a little bit I got maybe closer
[1:06:25] to him or whatever. But anyway, I heard
[1:06:27] him say, "I can't get a pulse." I said,
[1:06:29] "It's in my ears."
[1:06:32] And so he felt up in here and felt a
[1:06:34] little bit of a pulse. And my heart was
[1:06:37] going 250 times a minute, you know, and
[1:06:42] it's the surgeon. And so they took me to
[1:06:45] the ER there and the doctor said he
[1:06:49] said, you know, he came and I I was in
[1:06:52] and out of it, but I remember him
[1:06:55] saying, I don't know if I can save you,
[1:06:58] but I'll try.
[1:07:01] And
[1:07:02] they just, you know, expecting me to not
[1:07:06] make it. And then they I went out and
[1:07:11] they gave me a shock treatment. was out
[1:07:13] and put me in intensive care and then
[1:07:16] put a pacemaker and a fibrillator in me
[1:07:18] and and I've been doing good ever since.
[1:07:22] But I'm very weak. I I could walk before
[1:07:26] all that happened. But what really
[1:07:28] struck me more than anything, I didn't
[1:07:31] have time to say, "Lord, forgive me." I
[1:07:35] all I said, "No, I'm not." And and that
[1:07:39] was it. I don't remember.
[1:07:41] and I didn't have time to do anything.
[1:07:45] So, it kind of changed me when I got
[1:07:48] where I could get around out of the
[1:07:50] hospital.
[1:07:52] uh my perspective of different things,
[1:07:56] getting my house in order, doing things
[1:07:58] that would make it easy on Donna if
[1:08:00] something happened to me, you know, and
[1:08:03] it's just uh
[1:08:06] so I still look at it that God gave me
[1:08:09] more time for some reason
[1:08:12] and I just uh
[1:08:15] I thank the Lord for it. And I I know I
[1:08:20] have three daughters
[1:08:22] and all three of them waits on us.
[1:08:27] If we go, we can't hardly do anything.
[1:08:29] They're right there to help us.
[1:08:32] Yeah. And so they fix great meals, too.
[1:08:39] So,
[1:08:41] you uh you said you moved here in 1966.
[1:08:45] What made you make the decision to move
[1:08:47] to Tucson?
[1:08:48] Well, we were planning for a year since
[1:08:51] he preached the choosing of the bride.
[1:08:54] Yeah.
[1:08:56] We down in LA area where we were and and
[1:09:00] we started planning on moving, but we
[1:09:02] couldn't
[1:09:05] come up with enough money to move with.
[1:09:08] And so I
[1:09:10] uh took redoing a lot of VA and FHA
[1:09:16] remodels when people go bankrupt in them
[1:09:18] and clean them, fix them all up before
[1:09:22] they resell. And on the sideline after
[1:09:25] we'd work, Don and I'd work sometimes at
[1:09:27] midnight washing, you know, doing things
[1:09:30] there. The stoves would be so dirty that
[1:09:33] have soak them in the bathtub. This is
[1:09:36] things. But but we made enough money and
[1:09:39] like I said, we barely had enough to
[1:09:42] drive to Tucson and had about all we had
[1:09:46] is $105 to pay for rent. And then the
[1:09:49] Lord worked it out perfect. So you were
[1:09:52] in that service and choosing a bride. I
[1:09:55] believe brother Brandon he preached at
[1:09:57] the end about three different sermons
[1:09:59] you know different nights there I think
[1:10:01] it was. And that's when he said, uh,
[1:10:05] Capernium, thou callst thou, thyself,
[1:10:08] the city of the angels. Yes. Yeah. And
[1:10:12] and you remember that. And that's what
[1:10:14] Well, it I do, but a lot of times that
[1:10:19] stuff don't register with you until
[1:10:21] later. Yeah. And and I know brother M
[1:10:25] talked about his message going into
[1:10:29] different languages and books around the
[1:10:31] world.
[1:10:32] So they la they asked Leo and Jean how
[1:10:35] many places are translating and doing
[1:10:38] this? They said I don't know of none. We
[1:10:41] just sent two tapes to Germany is all I
[1:10:44] know you know. Yeah.
[1:10:46] And so I, brother Brandham, a lot of his
[1:10:50] message is for us right now. And you
[1:10:54] can't
[1:10:56] uh because now we're translating a lot,
[1:10:59] printing a lot of books,
[1:11:02] trying to they got the agapa tablet and
[1:11:05] brother Bisco has the hub and so things
[1:11:09] are going
[1:11:11] around the world pretty well. Yeah. When
[1:11:13] when brother Brandham, by the way, for
[1:11:16] the people that listen to tapes, brother
[1:11:18] Brandham said many times that these
[1:11:20] tapes are translated and they go around
[1:11:22] the world.
[1:11:24] And the fact is when he said that, there
[1:11:28] were no tapes going around the world.
[1:11:30] And there were no tapes being
[1:11:31] translated. Yeah. There was a few being
[1:11:33] sent, I think a couple being sent to
[1:11:35] Germany. And um brother I know this
[1:11:38] because I was friends with brother
[1:11:40] Sauman who had the the franchise on the
[1:11:43] tapes and brother Maguire and both of
[1:11:46] them told me personally we didn't send
[1:11:49] any tapes overseas with the exception of
[1:11:53] Germany and I think brother Maguire said
[1:11:56] he sent he remembered sending I think
[1:11:58] one package to South Africa and that was
[1:12:01] it and they weren't translated
[1:12:04] but Now they're translated into I
[1:12:08] believe when I left
[1:12:10] Jeffersonville it was 73 different
[1:12:12] languages
[1:12:14] and every nation on earth had been sent
[1:12:18] brother Brandham's message.
[1:12:20] Yeah.
[1:12:22] You know brother brother Ben Bryan
[1:12:25] worked with me and we built the first
[1:12:28] offices that brother Borders had really
[1:12:31] and I knew I was up to his house. He
[1:12:34] printed the first book in a garage he
[1:12:37] had there. Then then on sixth street he
[1:12:41] opened got a building and it actually
[1:12:45] was the very minute that brother
[1:12:47] Brandham like 649 whatever it was uh
[1:12:52] when brother Brandham passed away and
[1:12:54] that address was the same as he passed.
[1:12:58] And so we got it up and they got a lot
[1:13:02] of printing and going and different
[1:13:04] things. I'd go down there at night and
[1:13:06] run their presses and staplers and
[1:13:10] whatever they need to make it work and
[1:13:13] eventually over time he moved to JF.
[1:13:17] Do you know who he's talking about when
[1:13:18] he said brother Borders? So brother
[1:13:20] Borders was brother Brandham's campaign
[1:13:23] manager. And after brother Brandham
[1:13:25] passed away, brother Borders uh started
[1:13:28] he worked with brother Billy Paul in
[1:13:30] starting um William Brandon Evangelistic
[1:13:33] Association and that was actually that
[1:13:38] didn't turn into but brother Borders
[1:13:40] started spoken word publications. Yes.
[1:13:43] Spoken word um printed brother
[1:13:46] Brandham's sermons and I don't know if
[1:13:48] they did much translating but they they
[1:13:52] did a lot of printing and sending the
[1:13:55] sermons around the world. Then in 1981,
[1:13:57] brother Joseph Brandom
[1:13:59] um started doing the duplications of the
[1:14:03] audio. Sam Borders
[1:14:06] is You're going to like this story. So
[1:14:09] you knew Brother Borders pretty well. Oh
[1:14:11] yeah. You knew he liked to cut up. Yeah.
[1:14:13] Yeah. He he had a good sense of humor.
[1:14:15] Well, Sam Borders, I was Sam's
[1:14:17] supervisor in Jeffersonville.
[1:14:21] Sam told me a story. Well, he gave a
[1:14:24] testimony. We're down in I don't know, I
[1:14:27] think it was southern Mexico or Peru,
[1:14:29] somewhere in Latin America. And Sam gave
[1:14:32] the testimony that his mother, Did you
[1:14:35] know Sister Helen? Oh, yeah.
[1:14:37] Sis, Sister Helen was she was in the the
[1:14:40] front row and it could have been in
[1:14:42] Coina, I'm not sure. It was somewhere in
[1:14:44] California.
[1:14:46] Sister Helen was sitting in the front
[1:14:48] row and she wanted a baby
[1:14:51] and she was barren. she couldn't have
[1:14:52] children.
[1:14:54] And um brother Brandon was going through
[1:14:58] the discernment and he said he went to
[1:15:01] the first person now you brother or
[1:15:03] sister you have this problem and this
[1:15:04] and this and then you sister you have
[1:15:07] this problem and this and this and then
[1:15:08] he gets to sister Helen
[1:15:11] and he skips her and he goes to the next
[1:15:15] person and he goes on and on. So after
[1:15:18] the after the meeting, brother Brandham,
[1:15:21] brother Borders, Sister Helen and some
[1:15:24] others they were having having dinner
[1:15:28] and brother Brandham tells sister Helen
[1:15:30] he he said sister Helen he said
[1:15:34] um when I was under discernment and he
[1:15:38] said you notice I skipped you and she
[1:15:41] said yes brother Brandham I noticed
[1:15:43] that. He said, "Sister Helen, you were
[1:15:45] praying for a baby."
[1:15:47] And and she said, "Yeah." And Brother
[1:15:49] Brandham Yeah. already knew it. But he
[1:15:53] said he said, "You were praying praying
[1:15:54] for a baby." And and he said, "Sister
[1:15:56] Helen," she he said, "I didn't see a
[1:15:59] baby."
[1:16:01] And Sister Helen says, and you know,
[1:16:04] Sister Helen, she said, "Well, Brother
[1:16:06] Brandham, I'm gonna have one anyways."
[1:16:10] And he said, he said, "You just keep
[1:16:12] that. You just keep that attitude. Yeah.
[1:16:14] So, a little while later, they adopted a
[1:16:18] son and and and his name is Stephen. I
[1:16:20] don't know if you ever met Stephen.
[1:16:22] Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So, they adopted a
[1:16:24] little boy and his name was Stephen. And
[1:16:27] they were holding him. They brought him
[1:16:28] to Brother Brandham to be dedicated. And
[1:16:32] brother Brandham dedicated Stephen. And
[1:16:34] he said, "Sister Helen," he said, "now
[1:16:36] that you've adopted a baby, now you
[1:16:39] probably have one." And brother Sam was
[1:16:42] given that testimony and he said,
[1:16:44] "So I'm probably."
[1:16:49] And when he told me that, I couldn't
[1:16:52] help it. I came up and I said, "That's a
[1:16:56] good name for him. He's probably going
[1:16:58] to be to work on time. He's probably
[1:17:01] going to get his work done, but not
[1:17:04] guaranteed." But yeah, that was Brother
[1:17:06] Sam Borders. Yeah. Still good friends
[1:17:08] with him, right? Right. When brother
[1:17:10] Brandon before or brother Borders passed
[1:17:12] away, he lost all his limb nodes, you
[1:17:15] know, and and so he couldn't be around
[1:17:18] people very much. And so I him and I we
[1:17:22] bought some ground back there where he
[1:17:24] Sister Helen lives now. And he knew he
[1:17:28] was going to die.
[1:17:30] And so I went up and met with him and we
[1:17:33] decided I they couldn't get to the back
[1:17:36] acres unless they drive through
[1:17:39] right next to his house, but I I had the
[1:17:43] barn and some other things there. And I
[1:17:45] so I sold it and he uh then they was
[1:17:49] able to sell that in the back. And he
[1:17:52] said, "I want some for sister Helen and
[1:17:54] the children to live in before I'm
[1:17:56] gone."
[1:17:57] And that's what the purpose and I helped
[1:17:59] him do that there. I'll tell I'll tell
[1:18:02] brother Sam that. Yeah.
[1:18:05] Yesterday you said something to me about
[1:18:08] what you thought your calling or your
[1:18:09] purpose was. Do you remember that? Well,
[1:18:13] I think everybody's born with a a gift.
[1:18:17] And I think it depends where you use it
[1:18:20] for the Lord. You can be a singer. You
[1:18:23] can sing and use it for worldly things
[1:18:26] like Elvis Presley did the excellent
[1:18:29] singer with good voices.
[1:18:32] uh but no you know and some has the gift
[1:18:36] of preaching and they a leadership
[1:18:42] uh you know you just you all have a a
[1:18:45] purpose and I felt I can't sing I can't
[1:18:50] carune and my dad teach music and my
[1:18:55] sisters all sung and I I couldn't even
[1:18:58] do nothing but but But I felt my calling
[1:19:03] was just work and support the
[1:19:06] missionaries and the ministers and and
[1:19:09] those that has that gift. And so I
[1:19:12] figured, well, somebody's got to support
[1:19:14] them. So Lord, let me be me. And I
[1:19:18] always thought of in Isaiah, you know,
[1:19:21] where he was talking about putting that
[1:19:24] cif of fire upon his lips and and wiped
[1:19:28] away his iniquity. And I pray that quite
[1:19:31] a bit. Lord,
[1:19:33] just put that cifier on my lips and wipe
[1:19:36] away my iniquity and then let me be set
[1:19:40] there for a service for you. Whatever
[1:19:43] you need, here I am.
[1:19:45] And that's the way I always looked at
[1:19:47] that. And I I just some
[1:19:52] of us maybe just a housewife
[1:19:55] and sometime you move to an area and
[1:19:58] maybe there's only one person you'll
[1:20:01] testify to then you might move on or
[1:20:03] there may be a hundred you testify to
[1:20:06] but your life shines in around and
[1:20:10] sometime people start asking questions.
[1:20:12] I never went up to somebody and and
[1:20:16] started, you know, trying to preach to
[1:20:19] them or anything, but they get asking
[1:20:21] questions and I'll tell them and even
[1:20:24] about brother Brandham, I always center
[1:20:27] and and say, "Oh, brother Brandham said
[1:20:30] this. Brother Bham said that
[1:20:34] uh you always go back to the Bible and
[1:20:37] use it." But then when you really want a
[1:20:40] full understanding of it, then you go to
[1:20:44] the message and make sure that you're
[1:20:48] saying what Apostle Paul said.
[1:20:50] And like I said about other churches,
[1:20:53] you won't, you know, there's 900 and
[1:20:57] some organizations, you know, when
[1:20:59] brother Ben Ren was here in thousands of
[1:21:02] churches, and we know that they're not
[1:21:05] going to be a lot of those being the
[1:21:07] bride and the remnant.
[1:21:09] And I I really my feelings
[1:21:13] just like he's talking about Jesus if
[1:21:16] you don't accept the change in your life
[1:21:19] and and I think of Luther and Wesley and
[1:21:23] sanctification justification
[1:21:26] what happened to the people that
[1:21:28] wouldn't receive that you know and and
[1:21:30] here brother Bram come along with his
[1:21:33] message and like it was in Moses it's a
[1:21:36] oneman message
[1:21:38] and I but God has prophets and brother
[1:21:42] Brandham from a child he had visions and
[1:21:46] different things that happened to him
[1:21:49] and he did in time use it for the Lord.
[1:21:53] He could have did it and made a lot of
[1:21:56] money just telling people what about
[1:21:58] their lives, you know, but he God gave
[1:22:01] him that desire and he'd go away and
[1:22:03] pray for days and fast and and he always
[1:22:08] you hear him talk
[1:22:11] I think he if I remember right he fasted
[1:22:14] about three days before a big meeting
[1:22:17] and when he's praying for the sick in
[1:22:21] discernment it's a different anointing
[1:22:23] than just preaching,
[1:22:25] you know, and he says that a lot of
[1:22:28] places too. And then there's a few
[1:22:31] places
[1:22:33] and I feel that about even brother Evans
[1:22:37] uh God uses his voice. He said God it's
[1:22:42] not me. It's you know he's using my
[1:22:45] voice or Yeah. And and I think one or
[1:22:51] two, three words from God means more
[1:22:54] than you can read out of the Bible any
[1:22:57] day, you know. And it just when that
[1:23:00] anointing is there,
[1:23:02] the Lord will take care of it. Amen. And
[1:23:05] that's it. Amen. Amen.
[1:23:11] What uh
[1:23:13] Phillips what you've been very
[1:23:16] successful raising family
[1:23:20] and keeping the Lord Jesus in the center
[1:23:23] of your life and and now you you look at
[1:23:26] your children and your children's
[1:23:28] children.
[1:23:30] It's it's been a success story, your
[1:23:33] family. Yeah. Can you give us some
[1:23:36] advice
[1:23:38] on how we can do the same?
[1:23:41] I pray a lot for the grandchildren. I
[1:23:44] sometime I call all their names out. It
[1:23:47] helps me remember who they are
[1:23:51] and and but but that you know I I want
[1:23:56] the Lord to move in their lives. And I
[1:23:58] know I always gave the young married
[1:24:03] when they granddaughters and stuff. I
[1:24:07] tell them you got to work on your
[1:24:08] marriage every day.
[1:24:10] You can't take it for granted. You got
[1:24:13] to do just get up in the morning, think
[1:24:16] of something. I'm going to do this for
[1:24:18] her today or him just so you know you
[1:24:22] keep that love going or it will die over
[1:24:24] time. Sweetheart, can you write that
[1:24:26] down?
[1:24:28] I'm just kidding.
[1:24:31] You want this tablet?
[1:24:35] But but I think it's the same way with
[1:24:38] the Lord. You got to work on your
[1:24:41] spiritual every day. You can't just take
[1:24:44] it for granted that the Lord saved me. I
[1:24:47] got the Holy Ghost. You know, you got to
[1:24:49] spend time talking to him. You got to
[1:24:51] spend time reading the Bible if if you
[1:24:54] want to be close to the Lord.
[1:24:56] And I just never could picture heaven,
[1:24:59] me being there and my grandkids, my
[1:25:02] daughters or anything wasn't there.
[1:25:05] Amen. I just
[1:25:07] So I hope I'm like the jailer. I believe
[1:25:10] for them, you know. I just Yeah. Amen.
[1:25:13] You know, it's u
[1:25:15] that's sort of and I tell them if you
[1:25:18] get upset,
[1:25:20] are you going to hold a grudge 5
[1:25:22] minutes, 2 hours, 3 days, two weeks?
[1:25:25] Yeah. You I told them you need to be
[1:25:28] able to walk into a bedroom
[1:25:30] and pray a little bit, come right back
[1:25:32] out and say, "Honey, you want to go
[1:25:34] shopping or something?" You know,
[1:25:37] and amen. I remember one of my
[1:25:39] granddaughters said, "Grandpa,
[1:25:42] write it down.
[1:25:45] Brother Jordan looked at me says, "You
[1:25:47] going to write that down?"
[1:25:50] The one come back there. She said, "But
[1:25:53] grandpa, I hadn't come to that yet cuz
[1:25:55] she couldn't forgive and you know, she
[1:25:58] back ready to whip me over a little bit
[1:26:02] or something."
[1:26:04] But that's I truly believe that. And it
[1:26:08] and
[1:26:09] it don't do no good to be upset at
[1:26:13] anybody and carry a grudge if they're
[1:26:16] your neighbor or your friends. And even
[1:26:19] if they do things against you, be like
[1:26:21] brother Brandham that
[1:26:24] your own family can't tell your friends
[1:26:26] from your enemies.
[1:26:29] And I think it's wonderful.
[1:26:33] Grandpa was very one of the things that
[1:26:36] was very impactful to me. Grandpa and
[1:26:39] grandma was grandpa would tell us as
[1:26:42] little children. He says, "I'm praying
[1:26:43] for you and I'm praying for your
[1:26:44] spouse." And I remember this is from a
[1:26:47] very young age. And so so much of that,
[1:26:51] you know, us kids knowing that the
[1:26:53] children that the ones we've married has
[1:26:56] was they were praying for them before
[1:26:58] maybe even they were born. And that was
[1:27:00] that meant a lot. The other thing
[1:27:02] grandpa did was he talked about work,
[1:27:05] but he probably wouldn't say this, but
[1:27:08] he's one of the hardest workers I've
[1:27:10] ever met. And his education isn't very
[1:27:14] good. He'll learn someday. Do what?
[1:27:18] You're it might change. He he would
[1:27:22] struggle to read. Um, and grandma would
[1:27:25] read him on tape the the general
[1:27:28] contracting manuals so he could pass the
[1:27:30] tests and years later when he was
[1:27:33] working for Mr. Fees who was a multi
[1:27:35] multi-millionaire
[1:27:38] there. We would go to the office there
[1:27:40] and they would be bringing checks to
[1:27:41] grandpa to endorse multiple millions of
[1:27:43] dollars and the bankers would be calling
[1:27:46] him and saying we're going to work on
[1:27:47] this project and Mr. Vikes would have
[1:27:49] the planes come in and take grandpa
[1:27:51] places and they would land in a town and
[1:27:54] the mayor would come out and the city
[1:27:55] council would come out. They would meet
[1:27:57] grandpa at the run at the plane there
[1:28:00] with the red carpet and his boss is
[1:28:02] flying the plane and grandpa would say
[1:28:04] no it's it's the man flying the plane
[1:28:06] that you want to treat well. But Mr.
[1:28:08] Fikes would really depend on grandpa
[1:28:11] wouldn't buy any land anywhere and they
[1:28:13] were in multiple states across the
[1:28:14] United States and and uh just the Lord
[1:28:17] really blessed him in his job and his
[1:28:19] work and finances and just being
[1:28:21] diligent and his desire was to see
[1:28:24] missionaries and ministers and support
[1:28:27] the printing and the the the
[1:28:30] transcription of the message. Grandma
[1:28:32] would spend days, you know, they would
[1:28:34] spend time, he just said, at night, you
[1:28:36] know, helping with the printing or
[1:28:38] transcribing sermons when everything was
[1:28:40] done very manual. Now it you could
[1:28:42] probably much probably drop all the
[1:28:44] audio files into a computer and it would
[1:28:46] do it in 10 minutes. But this was back
[1:28:48] in the day where every word and every
[1:28:50] comma, everything had to be typed out by
[1:28:52] hand with typewriters. And so grandpa
[1:28:55] would spend quite a bit of the money
[1:28:57] that they would get a huge percentage
[1:29:00] and give it to voice of God, brother
[1:29:02] Biscll, to brother Mamalus to different
[1:29:04] ones and would support the works. It
[1:29:07] wasn't about any particular ministry or
[1:29:10] or a particular work, but he would just
[1:29:12] wanted to see the message and and people
[1:29:16] receive the Holy Ghost and be saved. And
[1:29:18] so that was always a big impact to us
[1:29:20] children, grandchildren growing up. At
[1:29:23] least for me it was
[1:29:25] well
[1:29:28] I worked uh before
[1:29:32] brother Joseph got started the year
[1:29:35] before there was five ministers that was
[1:29:37] running the voice of God at the time and
[1:29:41] and so brother Momus wanted to put print
[1:29:44] the books and put them in I can't say
[1:29:47] the word chronological order
[1:29:50] and uh Um,
[1:29:53] and so we started working on them and
[1:29:57] putting them in there. So, we did the
[1:30:00] whole
[1:30:02] uh message
[1:30:05] and I worked out with brother Bisco to
[1:30:08] put it on the hub and we had the
[1:30:10] freeword.com. Randy Snow and I did and
[1:30:14] he wanted a hub for different languages
[1:30:16] like in the mall you can go in there you
[1:30:18] want Chinese or something you just press
[1:30:20] a button and it comes out in Chinese.
[1:30:23] That's what started it. And then now
[1:30:26] they've translated
[1:30:29] different language a lot in Africa, a
[1:30:31] lot almost all of China the books and
[1:30:36] it's just uh
[1:30:38] they wanted to print a Bible in China
[1:30:42] because they had that Union Bible that
[1:30:46] they left a lot of things out of it. So,
[1:30:50] I got I don't know seven or eight Bibles
[1:30:54] from the voice of God of Brother Brandon
[1:30:57] that he used and and I sent them over to
[1:31:01] Brother Murphy and them and they took
[1:31:05] them apart and give them to different
[1:31:07] people to translate
[1:31:09] and then they put the Union Bible on one
[1:31:12] page and the other one over here and
[1:31:15] showed what the Union Bible left out.
[1:31:19] and they couldn't hardly print enough of
[1:31:22] them. They everybody was want them. Then
[1:31:25] China come in and kind of blocked a lot
[1:31:28] of it.
[1:31:29] And they uh
[1:31:32] and some of the brothers had churches
[1:31:34] over there and all had to go to prison.
[1:31:38] And so I understand through them now
[1:31:42] and you don't realize how privileged you
[1:31:44] are to come here, but they they set a
[1:31:49] table like they're going to eat lunch or
[1:31:52] something. and they'll eat maybe half of
[1:31:54] it and they'll get up and have the
[1:31:57] services and they got people spotting
[1:31:59] down the road and they let them know
[1:32:01] that the police are coming or they
[1:32:04] whatever they for to
[1:32:08] and so they come to the house and
[1:32:09] they're all sitting back at the table
[1:32:11] eating, you know, again. So that's how
[1:32:15] they do and then some of the brothers
[1:32:18] finally get caught some way and go to
[1:32:21] prison for three or seven years or
[1:32:24] something like that.
[1:32:26] So it's it's a privilege to be able to
[1:32:29] come and worship and pray all you want.
[1:32:33] It's uh and you got a pastor here would
[1:32:37] teach you proper. He's really I tell Don
[1:32:41] he's actually a theologian in the Bible.
[1:32:48] I um I worked a little bit with that
[1:32:51] brother. I think he's in Shenzen in
[1:32:53] China.
[1:32:55] And they would have little groups meet
[1:32:57] like this and spies come in and
[1:33:03] infiltrate their um congregation. Yeah,
[1:33:07] that's it.
[1:33:09] and uh a Christian the very foundation
[1:33:12] of Christianity is to bring other people
[1:33:14] in.
[1:33:16] So a very very difficult situation and
[1:33:19] Chinese government knows this and yeah
[1:33:21] they would send in spies and uh threaten
[1:33:26] and come in and raid the the churches
[1:33:30] and threaten the women, threaten the
[1:33:33] men.
[1:33:34] Um, we are, like you said, brother, we
[1:33:37] are blessed to live in this country.
[1:33:38] Sure. China actually prints more Bibles
[1:33:42] than anybody in the world, but you they
[1:33:46] won't are not able to sell them to
[1:33:47] China. They got to ship them out, right?
[1:33:50] And they're going to try to smuggle them
[1:33:51] back, you know. Yeah. It's true. Yeah.
[1:33:53] Because they have the cheap printing.
[1:33:54] I've done it. They have the cheap
[1:33:56] printing presses. We had the Bible. We
[1:33:58] would have the Bibles printed overseas,
[1:34:00] but everything's locked and and and
[1:34:02] shipped back to us. And the people of
[1:34:05] China, they can't have their own Bibles.
[1:34:07] Yeah. They Well, they have a Bible, but
[1:34:10] it's that one that you were talking
[1:34:12] about, the Union Bible. Yeah. And it is
[1:34:14] approved by the government. And you can
[1:34:16] imagine how a communist government
[1:34:17] writes a Bible. Yeah. It's not the same.
[1:34:21] It's about the government.
[1:34:25] And I know that the uh internet's really
[1:34:29] helped a lot because they can print
[1:34:33] those that's got little printers. They
[1:34:34] can print books over Russia, China,
[1:34:37] wherever they're not able to. They've
[1:34:40] got a little printer hidden back in
[1:34:42] closet somewhere. And they they print
[1:34:45] out a lot of books for their
[1:34:47] congregation or, you know, when they're
[1:34:49] reading them and then some way they hide
[1:34:52] them from, you know, other uh to try to
[1:34:56] get through time with somebody raids
[1:34:59] their house or something.
[1:35:03] Uh, and it's like brother Evan said,
[1:35:05] they you have people come in like
[1:35:09] they're accepting your message and all
[1:35:11] they're infiltrating in into the
[1:35:15] service. Then they go tell the
[1:35:18] authorities all about what they do and
[1:35:22] and then they kindly they raid and they
[1:35:24] it happened similar in Germany when
[1:35:27] Germany was hiding some of the uh Jews
[1:35:32] people would come in and infiltrate then
[1:35:34] they'd find that they were hiding them
[1:35:36] in the attic or different places back
[1:35:38] then.
[1:35:41] And I I say about China and and even
[1:35:45] about the message, it don't matter who
[1:35:48] prints it,
[1:35:50] if it's uh they don't change it.
[1:35:54] Uh I
[1:35:57] uh you know, I' I'd like to see all
[1:35:59] Christian people do those things, but
[1:36:02] truly you you don't find that in and not
[1:36:07] everybody it works with you. everybody
[1:36:11] uh in any place that they work on books
[1:36:13] and tapes and stuff, they
[1:36:16] they got believers and unbelievers and
[1:36:19] then they got the real genuine dedicated
[1:36:21] people
[1:36:23] and and you can't
[1:36:28] I I I know
[1:36:31] back to drawing clicks and lines and
[1:36:34] drawing people out of your little you
[1:36:37] know what you believe and that's wrong.
[1:36:40] And I uh
[1:36:43] and I just I I like to see people
[1:36:46] fellowship and the ones that don't get
[1:36:48] to fellowship with other people, I think
[1:36:51] they're starving for fellowship. Yeah.
[1:36:54] And it just so
[1:36:58] I know it's a real privilege for us and
[1:37:02] we don't realize what we're going
[1:37:03] through right now, how privileged we are
[1:37:06] until someday they close things down and
[1:37:10] you know maybe the I don't know Catholic
[1:37:13] church or somebody take over and you
[1:37:15] have to do their Bible, you have to do
[1:37:18] different things and whatever way it is
[1:37:21] they're going to wind
[1:37:23] killing all the
[1:37:26] remnant according to brother Brandham
[1:37:30] and all the same way with that 144,000
[1:37:32] Jews.
[1:37:34] But but it's uh you can't imagine people
[1:37:38] turning in just a year or two to
[1:37:42] something
[1:37:43] and you know that that evil in that way.
[1:37:46] with it. When the time comes, it's going
[1:37:50] to be it's not something it's going to
[1:37:51] linger on for 20 years. It's going to be
[1:37:55] off before you know it.
[1:37:58] And so I I just
[1:38:02] like to see people that
[1:38:05] they're
[1:38:07] faithful about coming to church. You
[1:38:10] have to just honor people that
[1:38:13] he comes and fellowship and
[1:38:18] just be a friend to everybody. Amen.
[1:38:21] Pray for them.
[1:38:24] They're all struggling just like you.
[1:38:27] And and it's uh and that's where you got
[1:38:32] to keep a praying, keep reading your
[1:38:34] Bible, keep going to church to have that
[1:38:37] fellowship with everybody
[1:38:40] in order to make it. Amen.
[1:38:43] Amen. You appreciate brother Kenny.
[1:38:46] [Applause]
[1:39:01] Um,
[1:39:04] you know, we think about these gallant
[1:39:08] men and women
[1:39:10] that do all this work for the Lord and
[1:39:13] they risk their lives. And I've met
[1:39:15] quite a few in Iran, um, brothers from
[1:39:20] China and different countries that
[1:39:23] they're perfectly willing to give their
[1:39:25] life to give the gospel to their fellow
[1:39:28] countrymen.
[1:39:30] But we should never forget,
[1:39:33] never forget
[1:39:35] the man
[1:39:38] and woman that are standing behind these
[1:39:42] people that are risking their lives and
[1:39:45] making it to where they can do it and
[1:39:48] enabling them to bring the gospel to
[1:39:51] these countries. people like sister
[1:39:54] Donna, brother brother Kenny
[1:39:56] and and they are just as responsible
[1:40:00] for someone I forgot my Bible for
[1:40:03] someone giving a Bible
[1:40:07] to
[1:40:09] a a communist person or a fascist person
[1:40:13] as the as as the person that actually
[1:40:15] hands it to them,
[1:40:18] those people that are are behind them.
[1:40:20] the uh we the musicians can come and
[1:40:24] we'll close. The thing that meant the
[1:40:26] most I know everybody probably had a
[1:40:27] favorite thing tonight.
[1:40:31] The thing that brother Kenny said that
[1:40:35] meant the most to me was he said that he
[1:40:40] was talking about husband and wife and
[1:40:42] he said that you have to work on your
[1:40:43] marriage every day and it's true
[1:40:48] but then he said and the same with your
[1:40:51] walk with the Lord you have got to work
[1:40:54] on it every day that's being a Christian
[1:40:58] and friends it's not easy.
[1:41:01] Work on that walk with the Lord every
[1:41:04] day of your life because it is vital. It
[1:41:09] is the most important thing that you can
[1:41:11] do.
[1:41:13] And
[1:41:15] he's a man of God. You can feel it,
[1:41:18] isn't it? Doesn't it just feel good to
[1:41:20] hear brother Kenny talk? And you can
[1:41:22] tell that man's a Christian. And they're
[1:41:24] so rare today a Christian is. But I
[1:41:26] think tonight we met a Christian. Amen.
[1:41:38] With the brothers,
[1:41:52] Aaron asked me to share. Uh, brother
[1:41:55] Aaron, you you come. I'll I'll make it
[1:41:57] quick. Brother Erin asked me to share
[1:41:59] that there was a there was a a a girl
[1:42:02] that she wasn't living right and she had
[1:42:06] left a church and it was a church in the
[1:42:09] Midwest
[1:42:11] and she had left that church
[1:42:15] and just fallen into pretty bad sin.
[1:42:20] Pretty bad.
[1:42:22] And there was a funeral and
[1:42:26] uh her mom I believe one of her family
[1:42:29] asked her to go to the funeral and she
[1:42:31] didn't want to go. She didn't want to be
[1:42:32] around all those church people
[1:42:34] but they talked her into going
[1:42:37] and she came to the funeral and I
[1:42:43] believe
[1:42:44] God bless you sister welcome.
[1:42:48] and she broke down right there. The love
[1:42:53] that that man showed for her when she
[1:42:56] walked in, no matter what she looked
[1:42:58] like, no matter what she represented,
[1:43:02] and she gave her heart to the Lord
[1:43:07] Jesus. And that was years. And I was
[1:43:12] still in touch with her when I left
[1:43:14] Jeffersonville. And she was still
[1:43:16] serving the Lord. still standing for
[1:43:19] God. But it was because of somebody like
[1:43:21] brother Kenny, somebody like Sister
[1:43:24] Hope, somebody like Sister um
[1:43:29] any of you,
[1:43:31] Sister Leuna, sister, any of you, all
[1:43:34] sister Heather, brother Lyall, it
[1:43:36] doesn't matter what someone looks like,
[1:43:39] you never know if that is a child of God
[1:43:42] or not. You welcome that person. And it
[1:43:44] was just a kind word that change that
[1:43:47] changed their lives. Let's all stay.
[1:43:50] [Music]
[1:43:53] There's no other
[1:43:56] [Music]
[1:43:59] we can turn to.
[1:44:05] Who can help us
[1:44:09] face another
[1:44:12] day?
[1:44:17] Gentle
[1:44:18] shepher
[1:44:23] come and lead us.
[1:44:28] For we need
[1:44:32] for strength from there's no other.
[1:44:40] There's no other
[1:44:46] we can turn to.
[1:44:52] Who can help us
[1:44:56] face another?
[1:45:04] Gentle shepher,
[1:45:09] come and lead us.
[1:45:15] For we need you to help us find a way.
[1:45:24] [Music]
[1:45:26] And when we call him like that, then
[1:45:28] listen to him and do what he tells you.
[1:45:31] Hey, you know, your child comes to dad.
[1:45:33] Can I do this? Can we do this? You show
[1:45:35] it to him and then they go do something
[1:45:36] different and it doesn't come out. But
[1:45:38] when he instructs you, and I sure
[1:45:40] appreciate it, Brother Kenny. Yes. Amen.
[1:45:43] Just just laying it out like it was.
[1:45:47] I've known them for some time now, and I
[1:45:50] don't I don't feel I deserve to be
[1:45:52] treated as nice as he's treated me.
[1:45:54] That's right. He just makes you feel
[1:45:56] comfortable just to be around him.
[1:45:59] That's a spirit of Christ in somebody.
[1:46:03] So, let's do I know I know we we don't
[1:46:06] really like this song very much in this
[1:46:08] church. Psalms 34.
[1:46:12] I love that song.
[1:46:17] I sought the Lord
[1:46:21] and he answered me
[1:46:26] and delivered me
[1:46:31] from every fear.
[1:46:35] Those who look on him
[1:46:40] are radar.
[1:46:44] They'll never be ashamed.
[1:46:49] They'll never be ashamed.
[1:46:54] His form and cry.
[1:46:58] And the Lord heard me.
[1:47:08] enemy. He
[1:47:12] the son of God
[1:47:16] surrounds his saint.
[1:47:20] He will deliver them.
[1:47:25] He will deliver them.

[1:51:59] Lord bless you tonight. I don't have
[1:52:02] another song, so just play the Keep
[1:52:04] playing that one. Let's have Brother
[1:52:07] Arie closer.
[1:52:09] Brother Arie. Brother Arie, would you
[1:52:12] come up and close in prayer?
[1:52:16] Heavenly Father,
[1:52:20] I appreciate
[1:52:22] you.
[1:52:26] Heavenly Father,
[1:52:29] I appreciate
[1:52:32] you.
[1:52:35] I love you. adore you. I bow down before
[1:52:44] you. Heavenly Father,
[1:52:47] I appreciate
[1:52:50] you.
[1:53:01] [Music]
[1:53:06] I was thinking about how
[1:53:09] God answered prayer. Somebody brought up
[1:53:11] to me that Jesus answers the prayers of
[1:53:14] those demons want to go in the pigs, you
[1:53:16] know, and answered Cain's prayer and
[1:53:19] wicked Ahab's prayer.
[1:53:22] So, how much more should you and I be
[1:53:24] able to humble ourselves
[1:53:28] and ask something important to you, but
[1:53:31] make sure it's a good thing, you know?
[1:53:33] So Lord, we just ask you to help us to
[1:53:35] pray right and do everything right. We
[1:53:39] want to be your friend like Abraham was,
[1:53:41] Lord. And we will we can have friendship
[1:53:44] all over here on earth. And we
[1:53:46] appreciate it because these are people
[1:53:48] we can see and feel and talk to.
[1:53:52] So help us, Lord. We got people that
[1:53:55] need you and we need you. And I'm glad
[1:53:59] the scriptures are there that we could
[1:54:03] work out our salvation with fear and
[1:54:04] trembling and that the righteous will
[1:54:07] scarcely make it. Lord, something like
[1:54:10] that. I don't know. But worthiness,
[1:54:13] Lord. We Somebody talked about that,
[1:54:15] Lord. We're not, but you are. And we
[1:54:19] just want other people. We don't want to
[1:54:21] be selfish, Lord.
[1:54:24] So, thank you for the testimonies of the
[1:54:26] believers here. And my father-in-law,
[1:54:28] Lord, thank you for him. He raised in my
[1:54:32] mother-in-law just raised Rachel and the
[1:54:35] girls there to love you and what you
[1:54:39] said, Lord. And
[1:54:41] your prophets, your prophet, Lord,
[1:54:43] Father Brandham, just we just want to
[1:54:45] believe your prophets and prophets
[1:54:47] prosper in Jesus Christ's name. I thank
[1:54:50] you for these things. Amen.
