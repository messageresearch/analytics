[22:29] he goes by Johnny sometimes but his name
[22:31] is actually Justin and he was sitting
[22:34] back um there behind brother Zeke and I
[22:37] I called him out this morning and and
[22:39] mentioned him um that I'd met him out in
[22:42] front and he may be listening right now
[22:45] but I'll tell you what he was
[22:50] blessed and he really he was touched
[22:53] this morning I don't know if he's ever
[22:54] been in church before in his whole life
[22:57] in fact I'd say he probably hasn't
[22:59] um that
[23:01] boy has had a hard life by any anyone's
[23:05] standards he's
[23:07] alone young man you see he's just a kid
[23:10] he's all by himself here in Tucson and
[23:14] maybe he'll give us testimony someday

[23:19] difficult life that the boy has and I
[23:22] hope that he's found a family here that
[23:24] will love him and I hope I just hope he

[26:47] scripture let's turn in the Book of
[26:51] Psalms chapter 71 Psalm 71
[26:56] [Music]
[26:58] start with verse 14 Psalm 71
[27:05] verse4 thought this was
[27:08] fitting says
[27:11] this but I will hope continually and
[27:14] will yet praise thee more and
[27:17] more my mouth shall show forth thy
[27:20] righteousness and thy salvation all the
[27:22] day for I know not the numbers thereof I
[27:25] will go in strength in the strength of
[27:28] the Lord I will make mention of thy
[27:31] righteousness even of thine only oh God
[27:35] thou Hast taught me from my youth and
[27:38] hitherto have I declared thy wondrous
[27:42] works as you know we have um about once
[27:45] a month or so we have a testimony
[27:48] meeting I like I like for us all to
[27:50] share our testimony sometimes we'll
[27:53] share within the audience and other
[27:55] times we share with with some of the
[27:57] folks in church and brother Ron gave his
[28:01] testimony one time and and others have
[28:03] given theirs and tonight I've asked
[28:06] brother Ed dugall to give his personal
[28:10] testimony and share with us a recent
[28:12] trip that he took and he got to meet
[28:14] some of the Saints over in Europe and um
[28:19] I'm really looking forward to it brother
[28:21] Ed is somebody that I never knew him
[28:25] before I started coming to church but
[28:27] he's somebody that's just been a
[28:28] blessing to me and he's he's turned out
[28:30] to be just not just a colleague and a
[28:33] and a um somebody that we are work
[28:36] within the church but he's turned out to
[28:38] be just a very very close friend so I
[28:41] really appreciate brother Ed and and
[28:42] sister Kathy is his loyal helpmate just
[28:47] never take him shopping he said amen
[28:49] when I said that this
[28:51] morning I'm just kidding he has a lot
[28:53] more patience than I do um but uh I do I
[28:58] just appreciate brother Ed and sister
[29:00] Kathy so much they are truly pillars in
[29:02] this church and especially recently they
[29:06] have held up this church and everything
[29:08] that they've done with all of the
[29:09] construction and everything that's going
[29:11] on brother Ed has taken the lead on
[29:13] almost all of it and if it wasn't for
[29:17] brother Ed sometimes it's like Lord how
[29:19] could we ever do it lord always provides
[29:22] what we need there's a
[29:24] song that I sang uh I used to sing
[29:29] um well I didn't really sing it but but
[29:32] we used to sing it um when we would
[29:35] travel overseas and and we would sing it
[29:38] when we were talking about overseas
[29:40] missionaries and brother Ed uh mentioned
[29:43] it earlier and I think it's really
[29:44] fitting Daniel knows the song well um

[33:23] I could really use your prayers so uh
[33:27] let's let let's approach the throne
[33:29] Heavenly Father once again it's a
[33:31] privilege to be in your house Lord once
[33:34] again we call upon your name and Lord as
[33:37] I would give this testimony would you
[33:39] take my
[33:40] words move me out of the way anoint my
[33:43] thoughts
[33:44] Lord Lord I don't want
[33:46] myself in the way father
[33:50] but as I I
[33:53] share the Wonders that you've done for
[33:56] me in my life Lord May the others see
[33:59] that you can do the same for them would
[34:02] you receive honor and Glory this evening
[34:04] in the precious name of Jesus Christ
[34:07] amen you can go ahead and be
[34:12] seated I really like that song uh a
[34:15] little later toward the end I'll share a
[34:18] couple uh photos that we had on our trip
[34:21] little PowerPoint so I'll do that a
[34:23] little
[34:24] later
[34:26] um yeah I wanted to find
[34:29] out just really what uh a
[34:33] testimony what testimony
[34:35] meant so I looked it up uh this
[34:39] afternoon and there's a
[34:41] couple applications for
[34:43] it in the natural it the dictionary says
[34:48] it's a formal written or spoken
[34:51] statement especially one given in a
[34:53] court of
[34:55] law the other one is evidence or proof
[34:58] provided by the existence or appearance
[35:00] of
[35:01] something and then in a
[35:04] religious uh
[35:06] application a public recounting of a
[35:09] religious conversion or
[35:12] experience so my desire was
[35:17] to to share what the Lord has done for
[35:20] me in my life and I don't want this to
[35:23] be about Ed
[35:24] dugall yet it is about Ed dugall
[35:27] experience with the Lord his walk with
[35:29] the Lord so uh if you'll bear with me a
[35:32] little bit I I you know I get a little
[35:35] nervous here
[35:37] so I grew up in
[35:42] California and my my family was a very
[35:46] were very strong lutherans and we went
[35:49] to a couple different Lutheran
[35:52] Churches as we um moved around a little
[35:56] bit in California
[35:58] and then we ended up in San
[36:00] Jose uh and I'm not sure quite when
[36:05] maybe
[36:07] 63
[36:08] 6263 is when we moved to copertino San
[36:12] Jose
[36:15] area sometime shortly thereafter we uh I
[36:19] don't know how we ended up uh moving or
[36:21] switching churches but we ended up going
[36:24] to a Lutheran Church that brother did
[36:27] linhard was pastor of and his daughter
[36:30] Carol's here and she probably remembers
[36:33] me as a little runt running around but I
[36:36] became brother linhard's alter boy in
[36:39] the Lutheran
[36:41] Church and and I believe brother bradam
[36:45] said the Lutheran Church is was the
[36:48] right behind the Catholic
[36:50] Church uh so it very um
[36:58] very much
[37:00] into the doctrine of uh the Catholics
[37:02] and Lutheran and so on and are very
[37:06] similar
[37:07] but for
[37:09] somehow and I was talking to brother ly
[37:12] because uh I didn't remember everything
[37:14] but back
[37:16] in
[37:18] 66 brother Lawrence Mayfield had come
[37:24] and had apparently shared shared a
[37:27] message of brother brandham with brother
[37:30] linhard brother Lonnie Jenkins and
[37:35] um and at the time this little group of
[37:39] brothers and sisters in California they
[37:42] were looking for more than what the
[37:44] denomination was offering and it was
[37:48] something that they they latched on to
[37:50] and they they could see that yes this is
[37:52] what we we want to know more about this
[37:55] so it ended up they brought it to a
[37:58] group of people
[38:00] and my family was part of the little
[38:03] group of uh Believers
[38:06] there and it was at the first time early
[38:10] 66 uh that we heard the the prophet of
[38:13] of the Lord Brother brandham bring uh a
[38:15] message and I don't remember the the
[38:18] sermon exactly but there was there was a
[38:20] a handful of sermons you know one after
[38:22] another uh that were brought and we were
[38:24] listen listening to
[38:28] and the Lord started to move among the
[38:29] brothers and sisters
[38:33] there and after that we we were able to
[38:38] uh attend a church that I believe is uh
[38:42] correct me if I'm wrong it was brother
[38:44] Muse's Church wasn't it okay brother
[38:46] Muse was selling the church and we had
[38:48] an opportunity to go into this church
[38:52] and use it
[38:54] um and the Lord really moved and there
[38:57] was a a lot of people that wanted more
[39:00] of the Lord and uh was seeking the Lord
[39:04] and so I remember then
[39:08] it's
[39:09] um probably one one evening after
[39:13] service is that we started uh praying
[39:16] for the baptism of the Holy
[39:18] Ghost and I
[39:22] remember praying it was the first time
[39:24] i' had ever encountered tongues you know
[39:26] speaking and tugs
[39:28] and um and I believe you know I was
[39:31] baptized and uh filled with the Holy
[39:36] Ghost then my family decided to move
[39:38] here in later of 66 and so we we packed
[39:44] up and the whole family and off we came
[39:47] to Tucson and my my perception of Tucson
[39:51] was still Cowboys and Indians dirt roads
[39:53] boardwalks and you know I I was really
[39:55] shocked when I got here and actually
[39:57] found automobiles driving down the
[40:00] street uh but that was in ' 66 and we
[40:05] arrived less than 10 months uh after
[40:08] brother green had started the church on
[40:10] South
[40:12] Stone
[40:14] so my family the dugall family has been
[40:17] here almost from the very
[40:19] beginning and
[40:23] uh saw a lot of things I saw a lot a lot
[40:26] of things
[40:28] um does it make me special no not
[40:31] absolutely not I'm I'm not special
[40:32] because I was able to witness a lot of
[40:34] that I feel like I'm more responsible uh
[40:38] for what I was able to
[40:40] witness um growing up I remember
[40:43] seeing a spoken word uh start and spoken
[40:48] word was down here on South six uh
[40:50] north6 Avenue I think I sent uh brother
[40:54] Dan picture where it
[40:56] started uh I was part of a group of
[40:58] people or young people that
[41:02] uh we heard that you should love your
[41:05] brothers and sisters so much you should
[41:06] be able to stand around and pass the
[41:09] chewing gum around and you know that's
[41:10] what we did you know outside we a group
[41:13] of young people uh and I was never the
[41:16] first one to get all the flavor I was
[41:18] somewhere in the middle but yeah know we
[41:20] but I wasn't the last one so uh that
[41:23] fortunately and maybe that's why I still
[41:25] like bubble gum my wife says don't don't
[41:27] swallow it
[41:28] so uh I like the flavor so
[41:32] uh
[41:34] but my family moved to uh just outside
[41:37] just to the east of the airbase back in
[41:39] uh
[41:40] 60 built a house
[41:43] and um it was probably late
[41:47] 66 um early
[41:50] 67 and there um the kids on the
[41:54] street and this is uh
[41:58] we started playing um
[42:00] football and you know like all young
[42:03] kids we you know we could be pretty uh
[42:07] brutal in
[42:09] football and uh and it was in front of
[42:12] the house I I fell and I was
[42:15] injured got up went in cleaned off the
[42:18] injury and out back out I was out back
[42:21] out on the street playing
[42:22] football but that was the beginning of a
[42:24] life-changing event in my life
[42:28] little did I know that I had dirt
[42:31] further into the knee which created an
[42:34] infection um and I just didn't
[42:39] understand why it was um not feeling
[42:42] good and it came out to where the not
[42:46] only the the bus driver that used to
[42:48] haul me off to school but the school
[42:50] nurse came by when I wasn't in school
[42:53] took one look at me and told my folks um
[42:56] you need to get him to a doctor right
[42:59] away so Mom and Dad not you know Dad
[43:02] made a big whopping 75 cents an hour
[43:05] back in those days um we
[43:10] weren't we weren't will to do by no
[43:13] means they took me over to St Elizabeth
[43:15] of hungry that used to be over here on
[43:18] Speedway they drew they drew some blood
[43:21] they looked at me and they thought he
[43:23] looks bad drew the blood it was all
[43:25] infection
[43:27] so immediately I went over to TMC I was
[43:30] uh operated on that that night hoping to
[43:33] get the infection under control which
[43:36] ended up being
[43:37] staff and
[43:40] um was in ICU for our the ICU isolation
[43:45] for about 3 weeks and got shipped up to
[43:48] Phoenix to the Children's
[43:50] Hospital and for three months my folks
[43:53] didn't know if I was going to live or
[43:54] die I don't say these things to say oh
[43:58] poor brother red but it's just to to
[44:00] create a
[44:02] base because of that I lost
[44:06] uh I lost some height in my right
[44:10] leg and when I came got out I was I
[44:14] ended up in a body cast for a year and a
[44:18] half um and it made it really really
[44:20] hard to go to school so you know I
[44:22] homeschooled you know correspondence and
[44:24] things like that
[44:27] there was a reason for that I don't know
[44:30] what the reason would have been had I
[44:32] not been sick I may not even be here
[44:35] today uh maybe the Lord was just putting
[44:38] the brakes on me he had a a bigger plan
[44:41] in my life which as I look back now I
[44:45] can see but then I didn't see the
[44:50] plan all I knew is that I'd never be the
[44:53] same after
[44:54] that and as I progressed through through
[44:57] life uh I realized something even worse
[45:01] than the injury was the rejection that I
[45:03] had received growing
[45:06] up back then back in the 60s early
[45:09] 70s people with handicaps were not treat
[45:13] it or accept it the way they are today
[45:15] they were sort of pushed away that no
[45:17] one wanted to do anything with someone
[45:19] that's a handicap or a
[45:21] which left uh really deep scars
[45:24] in my life
[45:28] and so I went through life like that
[45:30] always being rejected uh because
[45:33] technically I wasn't
[45:35] normal and
[45:38] so that created uh in my life that
[45:42] created a
[45:45] stigma and so the only time my friends
[45:49] wanted
[45:50] anything to hang around is when I could
[45:52] provide you know
[45:54] uh the illicit uh things that we us
[45:59] young people got into uh back in the
[46:03] 70s and so I I got mixed up with the
[46:06] wrong
[46:07] crowd
[46:09] and and I and I realized um looking back
[46:14] how much pain I caused my
[46:17] family so I hung with a crowd uh some of
[46:21] them came here uh to the church and some
[46:24] did
[46:25] not and I remember uh some of us young
[46:29] men at the time we sat right here on
[46:31] this front
[46:33] row uh because we had done some things
[46:36] and uh our fathers were right behind us
[46:40] on the second row there and brother grin
[46:41] was right
[46:43] here and um you didn't really you didn't
[46:46] want to see the the wrath of brother
[46:48] green but we saw that the wrath of
[46:50] brother green in a loving
[46:53] way and right after that two of the
[46:56] young men were taken out from under the
[46:58] blood of the church and i' had never
[47:01] seen that I was mortified it was like oh
[47:04] wow you know I mean I was almost afraid
[47:06] to go outside thinking I was going to
[47:08] get struck by lightning or something
[47:09] like that and
[47:13] um it didn't happen but uh I I I'm
[47:17] thankful that
[47:21] um the Lord was mindful of me um the two
[47:26] young men did come back and apologize
[47:28] and uh started coming back to
[47:32] church then in
[47:35] 19 uh and and this went on until about
[47:39] 76 um that I I rebelled and I
[47:45] just I would come to church but I wasn't
[47:48] I was here physically but I wasn't here
[47:50] uh mentally I just showed up to say hey
[47:53] I went to
[47:55] church so in
[47:57] 1976 I walked into the church office it
[48:00] was over on Country Club and Glenn I
[48:04] believe it was with another young man
[48:08] and brother green looked at both of us
[48:11] and said how would you like to go to
[48:15] Israel and so I I'll I'll pause there
[48:18] but I'd like to back up there was a
[48:21] group of brothers and sisters that used
[48:22] to live in the trailer court and they
[48:24] were called the Tucson tribe the trailer
[48:26] court tribe uh wonderful brothers and
[48:30] sisters uh and when we were at the old
[48:34] Tabernacle they used to come
[48:37] up and deliver a message which the
[48:40] message was right but the delivery was
[48:43] wrong especially to a young person if
[48:45] you don't go to church you're going to
[48:47] hell and I'm thinking well forget you
[48:50] you know I don't like being told that so
[48:53] I I resented that group of people
[48:58] so in 1975 brother green um December
[49:03] meetings we were going to go out to
[49:05] Sunset
[49:07] mountain and uh it was going to be an
[49:09] all day
[49:10] outing and I didn't have a ride and
[49:13] there was a brother and sister
[49:16] uh that I I really didn't want to see I
[49:19] didn't want anything to do with them I
[49:21] didn't want I didn't want to talk to
[49:23] them I didn't want to be around them I
[49:25] just
[49:27] just didn't like them so brother green
[49:30] said you don't have a ride I said no he
[49:32] said' get in the motor
[49:33] home and there were two seats in this
[49:35] motor home you know passenger seat you
[49:38] know held two and then right behind was
[49:41] another place for two so I get in and
[49:44] who do I
[49:46] see I think boy this is going to be a
[49:48] long two and a half hours on and I and I
[49:51] was squirming but they started talking
[49:53] to me and it wasn't in a spirit of conf
[49:57] condemnation but it was a spirit out of
[49:59] love and they start explaining to me
[50:02] about Israel and what was going on in
[50:05] Israel they had moved to Israel in
[50:08] 73 and they started telling me
[50:11] everything about it and it was like it
[50:14] sparked my interest a little
[50:17] bit and uh we
[50:20] had two and a half three hours of a a
[50:23] wonderful talk and uh I didn't feel
[50:27] rejected I didn't feel condemned I I
[50:30] just uh that was the way the Lord was
[50:33] getting my
[50:34] attention so in
[50:37] 1976 when I walked into the office and
[50:40] brother green said how would you like to
[50:41] go to
[50:42] Israel I was adventurous you know I
[50:45] wasn't uh I wasn't 21 yet I said
[50:50] sure the other young man uh Steve said
[50:53] nope he didn't want to go brother green
[50:55] looked at brother Lonnie Jenkins who was
[50:57] the associate pastor at the time and
[51:01] said hey get him a
[51:04] ticket well everything that I had dealt
[51:06] with in my life being rejected football
[51:09] accident uh getting in trouble um being
[51:12] arrested ah held
[51:15] overnight all this stuff I I knew that I
[51:18] needed to get away and burn some bridges
[51:20] because I wasn't going to make it on my
[51:22] own if I kept the same
[51:24] crowd so I decided yeah I'd
[51:28] go and so 2 and 1/2 Weeks Later 3 weeks
[51:31] later I'm on my first commercial
[51:34] flight and I'm off uh in 76 and I'm
[51:39] going to
[51:41] Israel little did I know that it was a
[51:44] one-way ticket and there was no
[51:48] return so the Lord knows how to deal
[51:50] with you you know when you when you
[51:52] Rebel so and I think brother green
[51:56] purposely did that in In Cahoots with my
[51:58] folks so I I I don't know but off to
[52:01] Israel I went Adventure seeking
[52:04] yes so I I arrived if any of you know
[52:07] anything about Israel everything shuts
[52:09] down on Friday evening starts shutting
[52:12] down Friday afternoon for the evening
[52:15] because that's the beginning of Sabbath
[52:18] well I arrive probably 4:30 5
[52:21] o' and there's two
[52:24] brothers on their way to get me
[52:28] and I'm standing out in Israel I can't
[52:30] speak the language I can't read it I
[52:32] can't you know there's no way to Comm uh
[52:35] communicate with anybody and I'm
[52:37] wondering where's my ride so the only
[52:42] thing I knew to do is I have that I have
[52:45] an address where I need to
[52:48] go I get a
[52:51] taxi and happen to be an Arab uh taxi
[52:54] driver because there you know they work
[52:56] on the
[52:58] Sabbath and everything this now you have
[53:01] to understand this is a time when
[53:02] there's hijackings there's bombs going
[53:05] off and there's all this violence
[53:08] happening so I get in the back of this
[53:10] taxi and off we go toward
[53:12] natana and I'm thinking all I see is
[53:14] sand dunes in the ocean or Mediterranean
[53:18] Sea and I'm thinking boy this guy's
[53:19] going to take me and slit my throat
[53:21] throw my body out somewhere and you know
[53:23] no one's going to find me and that's the
[53:24] end well it happened that uh the two
[53:28] brothers were running late and there was
[53:31] no way to communicate so we sort of
[53:34] passed each other you know they're going
[53:35] to Tel Aviv to the airport I'm on my way
[53:37] to um natana and I get there and uh got
[53:42] with the brothers and
[53:44] sisters and
[53:46] um they were pretty happy you know Carol
[53:49] was there uh at the time there was some
[53:52] other brothers and sisters but Brother
[53:54] Ray Ericson some of you know know them
[53:57] uh he was
[53:59] there it was actually brother L's uh
[54:02] father uh and another I forget who the
[54:05] other brother was that was on on their
[54:07] way to pick me up brother Reynold uh
[54:10] Johnson and but I had missed him so that
[54:14] began that was the beginning of a
[54:17] long year which I didn't know that it
[54:20] was going to be a year but but I got
[54:23] there and I realized uh within that
[54:25] first week like what in the world did I
[54:27] do you know I'm here I can't I can't
[54:32] communicate
[54:35] but what it was for me was it was the it
[54:39] was the beginning of a new era I had to
[54:42] burn my bridge I couldn't go
[54:45] back and if you look at the uh in
[54:48] history some of the Conquistadors when
[54:50] they came to the new
[54:52] territory
[54:54] was their commitment was when they got
[54:57] off the ship to
[55:00] discover to go out and to search and
[55:04] discover the new land the new territory
[55:06] they burned their Bridges they burnt
[55:08] their ships and sunk the ships so there
[55:10] was no going back and this is what
[55:13] brother green did for me was that he
[55:15] gave me a one-way ticket and it was
[55:17] either sink or swim and I learned to
[55:22] swim so
[55:28] being there
[55:31] um I'd burnt all the bridges with the
[55:34] people I used to hang with all the drugs
[55:36] all the running around all the drink and
[55:38] that that type of Lifestyle I just had
[55:40] to burn it and I I
[55:45] started to seek the Lord and to get into
[55:48] the message and and read my Bible and to
[55:51] pray and and the Lord became very very
[55:54] real to me um uh during that
[55:58] time and it was in uh it was within the
[56:01] first two weeks I want to say that
[56:04] uh I stayed at brother Reynold Johnson's
[56:07] place with uh brother ly's parents uh
[56:10] and I lived
[56:12] in in an ultra Orthodox section of uh
[56:16] natana with
[56:18] u the ultra Orthodox Jews and it was uh
[56:23] quite different for me but during that
[56:26] time
[56:28] time the lord gave me a scripture and
[56:31] I'd like to read that to you Ezekiel
[56:36] 36 verse 25-
[56:39] 27 and the word says then I will
[56:42] sprinkle clean water upon you and you
[56:45] shall be clean from all your filthiness
[56:49] and from all your Idols will I cleanse
[56:51] you a new heart also will I give you and
[56:56] a new spirit will I put within you and I
[56:59] will take away the Stony heart out of
[57:01] your flesh and I will give you a heart
[57:04] of Flesh and I will put my spirit within
[57:07] you and cause you to walk in my
[57:11] statues and ye shall keep my judgments
[57:14] and do
[57:17] them and that really really helped
[57:19] because i' had never been away from home
[57:21] like that and I felt like the Lord was
[57:23] speaking to me directly I did have some
[57:26] experiences there
[57:28] um I worked at a local hospital that was
[57:31] under
[57:34] construction uh like some of the
[57:37] sisters and one night um I I came home
[57:41] late I worked 3: to 11: so it's probably
[57:44] 11:30 midnight uh that I actually you
[57:47] know climbed in bed and the way my bed
[57:50] was is that it was like right here and I
[57:52] had a chair at the head of the bed and I
[57:54] had put my slippers
[57:58] gotten undressed put my clothes there
[57:59] and uh climbed in
[58:02] bed and I'm I'm starting to go to sleep
[58:06] and I hear the this Shuffle of
[58:11] um the slippers
[58:13] moving you know I I heard them very
[58:16] vividly and my face was laying against I
[58:19] was facing the
[58:21] wall and I'm telling you I was freaked
[58:24] out uh because you could feel this evil
[58:27] presence right there I mean it was evil
[58:31] and I have felt that before uh when I
[58:33] was doing stupid things but this you
[58:36] could hear that shuffling of the the
[58:39] slippers and then I started praying with
[58:42] everything I had
[58:44] um calling on God in
[58:48] in the simple way that I
[58:52] could and I was I was terrified to even
[58:56] roll over and look because I I truly
[58:59] expected to see a demon or the devil
[59:01] standing right there and the more I
[59:03] prayed then all of a sudden a sweet
[59:06] presence came into the room I mean it
[59:08] was gone the evil was gone and my my the
[59:12] room wasn't very big you could ask you
[59:15] know Carol brother Lyall how big the
[59:17] rooms were they were very very small and
[59:21] this this room is where we ate had a
[59:23] little closet had my bed and so it was
[59:26] somewhat
[59:28] cramped and I rolled over and there was
[59:31] this white light the room was gone all I
[59:36] saw was this white light and there was
[59:38] such a sweet presence in the
[59:41] room and I know I had been delivered of
[59:45] things in my
[59:49] life in 1977 I came back uh after a year
[59:54] I guess I was paroled I was able to come
[59:57] back to the States I came
[59:58] back
[1:00:00] we um landed in new uh New York flew to
[1:00:04] Newark New Jersey on over to uh
[1:00:07] Pennsylvania picked up another young man
[1:00:10] at the time and we drove cross
[1:00:14] country it was in 1977 then I met
[1:00:17] brother Arie Peterson for the first time
[1:00:19] in Oakland uh we stayed with them I
[1:00:23] believe got to know the Peterson Family
[1:00:27] um and then I came back
[1:00:30] through
[1:00:32] uh a azuza
[1:00:35] California and I was able to to call my
[1:00:38] great-grandmother at the time and I
[1:00:41] wanted to find out a little bit about my
[1:00:43] history where she gave me my lineage uh
[1:00:46] my mother was
[1:00:47] Jewish and Bubba as we called her or
[1:00:52] Sarah you know Grandma Sarah she gave me
[1:00:55] my lineage all the way back to uh the
[1:00:58] tribe that we descended
[1:01:01] from and uh she told me we were Levites
[1:01:05] at the time so it was sort of my Mo my
[1:01:09] own mother didn't even know that until I
[1:01:11] told
[1:01:12] her uh my aunt was Jewish married in the
[1:01:16] synagogue so uh it was quite
[1:01:20] interesting I went back to Israel in
[1:01:23] late 77
[1:01:28] and I started hearing some of the
[1:01:32] brothers or some of the brothers called
[1:01:34] me hey we found a young lady for you and
[1:01:36] they started telling me about my wife
[1:01:39] Kathy and I said well I'll get back when
[1:01:42] I get
[1:01:43] back
[1:01:44] well you to understand this a little bit
[1:01:48] brother
[1:01:49] Fran my
[1:01:51] brother-in-law came to Tucson in 1970
[1:01:54] stayed with brother Lyle
[1:01:58] brother green invited him uh and he came
[1:02:01] to Tucson to learn uh to study the
[1:02:06] message he was young he was a young
[1:02:09] minister at the time uh didn't know a
[1:02:11] whole lot about brother brandham and
[1:02:13] brother green invited him well my
[1:02:15] sister-in our sister-in-law I should say
[1:02:18] just not mine but our sister-in-law
[1:02:20] Susan had got uh came to the Lord in
[1:02:24] 1970
[1:02:26] and had taken French in high school so
[1:02:29] brother green put Susan together with
[1:02:33] France wall so she could help him uh
[1:02:37] understand the the
[1:02:39] message obviously uh when you put two
[1:02:42] people like that together um Sparks Fly
[1:02:45] and uh they ended up getting married in
[1:02:50] 1970 so I tease uh franois that you came
[1:02:54] to America and stole an American girl I
[1:02:56] I'll get you
[1:02:57] back so in
[1:03:01] 1977 I started writing U sorry I started
[1:03:04] writing
[1:03:07] um the interest sparked up and I won't
[1:03:10] go back to 75 when I met Kathy the first
[1:03:12] time I wasn't interested so uh but in 77
[1:03:16] I start I hear Kathy this Kathy that and
[1:03:19] then I started uh get curious and so I
[1:03:22] write uh to do everything proper because
[1:03:25] you York is very traditional I write a
[1:03:27] letter dear brother France wall I was
[1:03:29] wondering if you'd give me permission to
[1:03:31] write to your sister
[1:03:33] Kathy about two weeks later I get a
[1:03:35] letter back and said dear brother Edwin
[1:03:37] yes I give you permission to write to my
[1:03:39] sister Kathy and great so I started
[1:03:42] writing
[1:03:44] Kathy only to find out that Kathy was
[1:03:47] franell secretary and she says franell
[1:03:49] what do I do whatever you want to do you
[1:03:52] write the letter so Kathy writes de your
[1:03:53] brother edman I give you permission to
[1:03:55] write themiz
[1:03:56] and I I found out after we were married
[1:04:00] so I think
[1:04:03] uh you know it was I was set up
[1:04:07] but um but I got I got the better of
[1:04:11] francoa I I went to Europe got his
[1:04:13] sister and then I I I got a secretary
[1:04:16] and then I brought her back to the
[1:04:17] States so I got him where where it
[1:04:21] hurts um but
[1:04:24] we Cath Kathy and I did go back to
[1:04:27] Europe or go back to Israel for a year
[1:04:30] and
[1:04:32] um there the Lord you know had given me
[1:04:35] a scripture about having I just I felt
[1:04:38] that the Lord was speaking to me about
[1:04:40] us being there and having children there
[1:04:44] so um we left went back to Europe and
[1:04:47] and that's where we uh we
[1:04:50] stayed until um 84 the first time
[1:04:57] because I was there I I was able to help
[1:05:01] brother
[1:05:01] Francois in the things that he
[1:05:05] does and it's the things
[1:05:08] of trivial things you help him around
[1:05:11] the house help him that I would be a
[1:05:13] driver um I would take him to different
[1:05:16] uh
[1:05:17] churches and we would uh he would
[1:05:19] Minister so I heard there's three
[1:05:22] sermons I heard multiple times
[1:05:27] and uh I still know the titles and I and
[1:05:30] when I when I'm with brother Francois I
[1:05:32] said well when are you going to preach
[1:05:34] this or when are you going to preach
[1:05:36] that he says you still remember that I
[1:05:38] said yeah I mean you ingrained it in me
[1:05:40] uh with all the traveling we did uh but
[1:05:43] it was the Oak in the Reed the gaying of
[1:05:47] Kora and there was another one I can't
[1:05:49] think of it right now but
[1:05:52] um those really you know I heard them
[1:05:54] multiple times
[1:05:56] and I heard him in French he didn't
[1:05:58] translate him from me I heard him in
[1:06:00] French and I understood him and got the
[1:06:03] Gest of
[1:06:08] them after we were married and I was
[1:06:12] working it came back you know there
[1:06:14] again the rejection came back
[1:06:17] out that I wasn't a normal person I you
[1:06:21] know I had a limp you know I my leg was
[1:06:23] an inch and a half shorter I when I
[1:06:25] worked I had my boss My foreman you know
[1:06:29] make fun of me because you know I had a
[1:06:33] handicap and it just refered um the
[1:06:38] resentment the hurt uh the pain that I
[1:06:41] had dealt with growing
[1:06:42] up but yet
[1:06:44] I I realized that God was mindful at
[1:06:48] me
[1:06:51] and brothers and sisters you go through
[1:06:54] difficult things
[1:06:56] whatever it may be you go through it you
[1:07:00] don't understand why you go through it
[1:07:02] but you go through it because it's
[1:07:05] character building and then when you
[1:07:07] look back at it oh that's why right I
[1:07:12] went through it it's not easy to go
[1:07:14] through it by no
[1:07:16] means
[1:07:19] but there was I look back at it and it's
[1:07:24] just like you know we we've talked would
[1:07:26] I go through everything I've gone
[1:07:28] through here again after losing brother
[1:07:31] green I and I'm I'm thinking yeah I
[1:07:33] probably would because it's the
[1:07:36] experience it's the lessons that I
[1:07:39] learned
[1:07:42] um from it doesn't it doesn't didn't
[1:07:46] make it easier but now I I I yes I would
[1:07:49] go through it again because the lessons
[1:07:52] are invaluable you can't put a price on
[1:07:55] that
[1:07:56] uh I am today who I am because of what
[1:07:59] I've gone through and I have no
[1:08:03] regrets um I've just had to work harder
[1:08:06] I've had to prove
[1:08:08] myself um to show people hey I can do
[1:08:11] this and I can do it better and I can do
[1:08:14] it faster than other
[1:08:18] people we we I brought the family back
[1:08:21] to the states in '
[1:08:24] 84 in8 5 we moved up to Flagstaff
[1:08:27] because I had I was buting heads with my
[1:08:30] dad uh and then couldn't really make it
[1:08:34] up in Flagstaff it was a very difficult
[1:08:36] time it was winter time and then we came
[1:08:38] back and we realized something uh back
[1:08:41] in we went back to Europe in '
[1:08:45] 86 we were too
[1:08:48] europeanized for the states we didn't
[1:08:51] like it I I didn't like it here I'm an
[1:08:53] American I did not like the states my
[1:08:55] family didn't like the states people are
[1:08:58] rude too much Freedom so we all we went
[1:09:01] back to Europe and the Lord miraculously
[1:09:05] opened the
[1:09:06] door for us to go back into
[1:09:10] Switzerland
[1:09:12] um to understand this you can't get into
[1:09:14] Switzerland without a job and you can't
[1:09:16] get a job without a permit and so it's a
[1:09:20] catch 22 sort of cancels each other out
[1:09:23] but immediately you know we applied and
[1:09:26] had a job to go back into
[1:09:29] Switzerland and that was at a time that
[1:09:31] brother francal was building his church
[1:09:33] in his
[1:09:34] home
[1:09:36] and I was able to help him with along
[1:09:39] with other brothers to go back there uh
[1:09:42] and build this the church brother Fran
[1:09:47] and sister Susan bought a at the time it
[1:09:49] was 300 uh 300y old farmhouse it's
[1:09:53] probably you know uh 300 50 now um but
[1:09:57] it was quite old and we totally gutted
[1:10:00] it
[1:10:02] and made the church there there at the
[1:10:05] same time uh Brother Francis was
[1:10:09] recording many nights I helped brother
[1:10:11] franwall with the recording of brother
[1:10:14] brandham in the French uh
[1:10:17] language at that time brother Fran
[1:10:20] would would take um a
[1:10:24] message he he'd play a portion of
[1:10:27] brother brandham the tape would stop and
[1:10:30] he translate directly
[1:10:33] um into the French language and this is
[1:10:35] how it would go and we often did this at
[1:10:38] night um until 2 3:00 in the morning
[1:10:42] because that's when it was quiet we
[1:10:44] didn't want the noise from the outside
[1:10:47] getting on to the
[1:10:49] recording brother Francois was very very
[1:10:53] um finicky
[1:10:55] in how the recording came
[1:10:58] out and that's why he is still the voice
[1:11:02] of brother brandham in the French
[1:11:07] language today I I'll show you all here
[1:11:10] in a little bit uh a couple pictures of
[1:11:14] of how he does it uh his church and just
[1:11:16] the different
[1:11:19] things
[1:11:21] so back in '89 I really felt led to
[1:11:24] bring my family back uh to the states
[1:11:27] and it was something that was important
[1:11:30] for me but yet I had stiff off position
[1:11:33] from it my own brother-in-law told me I
[1:11:36] was not stable it wasn't the will of the
[1:11:39] Lord and I wanted my kids to know their
[1:11:42] family uh their grandparents especially
[1:11:47] so when God wants you to do something
[1:11:51] God brother brother green used to say
[1:11:54] and brother br says you look at your
[1:11:56] motive and see if the the lights line up
[1:12:00] well the motive was correct the desire
[1:12:03] was there and then all of a sudden we
[1:12:05] had the finances everything just lined
[1:12:07] up we shipped our stuff we uh back and
[1:12:11] then our our children got to know um
[1:12:15] their
[1:12:16] grandparents our kids growing up uh have
[1:12:21] gone through a lot of difficult
[1:12:23] times our daughters gone through a
[1:12:26] difficult time our son's gone through a
[1:12:28] difficult
[1:12:29] time and it was the last few years uh
[1:12:34] and I won't go into details but we lived
[1:12:36] in a um we went through one of the
[1:12:40] darkest times of our life I I just
[1:12:44] couldn't see how the light any light
[1:12:47] coming through I just didn't understand
[1:12:49] why we were going through
[1:12:53] this 2005 our son
[1:12:55] uh our son's going to go to
[1:12:58] war it was a stressful time for me our
[1:13:00] daughter Rachel got married son's going
[1:13:03] to war uh he was going and then he
[1:13:05] wasn't going he's going he's not going
[1:13:07] finally he ends up
[1:13:09] going uh he's over in in Texas you know
[1:13:13] getting ready to to ship out to to
[1:13:16] Iraq I go to work uh one day and um my
[1:13:22] partner calls me and says Hey where's
[1:13:23] the trailer with all our equipment I
[1:13:26] said it's over here and he said no it's
[1:13:28] not and we're starting at 3:00 in the
[1:13:30] morning
[1:13:31] and I get I get to the job and sure
[1:13:34] enough our trailer had been stolen so we
[1:13:37] lost you know a lot of money a lot of
[1:13:40] equipment and then the very you know I'm
[1:13:42] dealing with that and then the very next
[1:13:43] day we have a construction accident
[1:13:45] where I almost lost a brother so my
[1:13:48] plate was overflowing with a lot of uh
[1:13:52] stress and a lot of things going on
[1:13:55] and I had a brother from flaxa call me
[1:13:57] and ask if I was all right I just you
[1:13:59] know by the grace of the Lord I'm doing
[1:14:01] well it was hard to go through so as as
[1:14:05] we advance the the
[1:14:10] time I had spoken in 2005 to brother
[1:14:14] Chester higs and I'm pouring out my
[1:14:16] heart to brother
[1:14:18] Chester about my son going to
[1:14:21] war and as a parent you don't want to
[1:14:24] see that for your children
[1:14:27] children
[1:14:29] and it became a very difficult time for
[1:14:33] me I felt I'm driving to Phoenix I'm
[1:14:35] gone and I feel the weight of the whole
[1:14:38] world on my shoulders and I'm crying to
[1:14:40] God and it just this weight gets heavier
[1:14:43] and heavier so as I'm talking to brother
[1:14:45] Chester about it and I'm sort of
[1:14:47] complaining crying about it and um I
[1:14:49] said you know I'm a father and I don't
[1:14:51] want to see my son go to
[1:14:53] war I mean never see him
[1:14:56] again
[1:14:59] and then it dawned on me and and I don't
[1:15:02] know why I said it but I said you know
[1:15:03] if I'm a father not wanting to see my
[1:15:06] son go to war how much do our heavenly
[1:15:08] father want care about his
[1:15:11] children and when I said that the weight
[1:15:14] the heaviness in the
[1:15:16] truck
[1:15:18] lifted now so you you brothers and
[1:15:21] sisters understand I travel I've
[1:15:23] traveled extend intensively and I've
[1:15:26] been gone for many years for a long
[1:15:30] time uh and I've spent over 300 nights
[1:15:33] in a hotel in a year uh I come home long
[1:15:36] enough to change suitcases and out the
[1:15:38] door
[1:15:42] again and so that's where I have my time
[1:15:45] A lot of times that's where I have my
[1:15:46] time with the Lord is when I'm traveling
[1:15:48] early and brother bham said early in the
[1:15:50] morning is the best time because the
[1:15:52] spirits are calm
[1:15:55] and so I find that's really the perfect
[1:15:58] time for me to commune with the Lord
[1:16:00] listen to uh a message um to pray to
[1:16:05] sing to Worship the Lord it's it's just
[1:16:08] in those brief
[1:16:12] moments and then I realized after I said
[1:16:15] that if my heavenly father cares about
[1:16:19] his CH if I care about my children not
[1:16:21] wanting to see him hurt how much more is
[1:16:23] our heavenly father
[1:16:26] and I got a revelation that carry has
[1:16:28] carried me through to this day that no
[1:16:31] matter what happens even if my own son
[1:16:33] came home in a body bag which is hard to
[1:16:37] accept God was in
[1:16:39] control and it's it's not something to
[1:16:42] take
[1:16:44] lightly and the weight of that statement
[1:16:47] is a pretty heavy
[1:16:50] weight and then we we go through this
[1:16:53] this dark moment
[1:16:56] I mean I just like where in the world
[1:16:58] did this come
[1:17:02] from and what kept coming back was it's
[1:17:05] okay leave it
[1:17:06] alone I'm in
[1:17:08] control I've got it handled don't worry
[1:17:12] about
[1:17:16] it every day for about a
[1:17:20] year when I was strong Kathy is weak
[1:17:23] when I'm weak Kathy was strong but God
[1:17:26] gave us a nugget to let us know it's
[1:17:29] okay I'm in control I've got it handled
[1:17:32] and I've got a reason I've done this and
[1:17:36] now as I look back I go Lord how
[1:17:39] gracious you've
[1:17:41] been um because we see the fruits of it
[1:17:46] of what has happened being changed
[1:17:51] and if you look at the story of Joseph
[1:17:55] Joseph went through all that he did in
[1:17:58] order to save
[1:18:01] lives Joseph Ro Rose to the right hand
[1:18:05] of pharaoh in order to save
[1:18:09] lives the other
[1:18:12] night Wednesday night we you were
[1:18:15] ministering on Daniel and we were
[1:18:18] talking about find a character in the
[1:18:21] Bible that you can identify with
[1:18:25] brother Daniel was talking about well he
[1:18:28] identifies with Daniel he identifies
[1:18:30] with Paul and I got to thinking about
[1:18:32] that well who do I identify with who can
[1:18:35] I identify with and then I thought I can
[1:18:39] identify with Joseph I I I haven't gone
[1:18:42] through what Joseph has gone through but
[1:18:44] I can identify with Joseph because when
[1:18:48] you look at what he went
[1:18:51] through he kept it he kept the right
[1:18:54] attitude through it all that's right he
[1:18:57] kept his
[1:18:59] attitude he trusted in Jehovah
[1:19:03] God I I'm sure he was down at times I
[1:19:06] mean there's there's no doubt he I'm I'm
[1:19:09] not saying he didn't have his moments
[1:19:10] but he rose to the right hand of pharaoh
[1:19:14] no one could come to Pharaoh without
[1:19:16] going through
[1:19:18] Joseph and then I started thinking I can
[1:19:21] identify with Joseph now I'm not the
[1:19:23] right hand of brother Dan please that's
[1:19:25] not what I'm saying but I could I could
[1:19:28] I could
[1:19:29] identify with the trials that Joseph
[1:19:33] went
[1:19:34] through and yet God being merciful and
[1:19:37] delivering them through
[1:19:39] that so the Lord has
[1:19:42] delivered me through many many things
[1:19:44] and the hardest part was growing up and
[1:19:47] being
[1:19:48] rejected because we none of us
[1:19:51] like uh the rejection no one Everyone
[1:19:55] likes wants to be
[1:19:58] liked but growing up I just had to deal
[1:20:00] with it and I moved on but it shaped my
[1:20:03] character and now it's like it's okay I
[1:20:07] I'm fine with uh what people think I
[1:20:10] don't know if you could go ahead and uh
[1:20:12] is that ready
[1:20:13] to the
[1:20:16] PowerPoint okay
[1:20:19] so through our life God has blessed my
[1:20:23] family God has blessed us for a number
[1:20:27] of
[1:20:29] years last three years I'm going to
[1:20:31] guess uh we had desired to go go back to
[1:20:34] Europe last time I was in Europe was in
[1:20:38] um
[1:20:40] 2016 and we saw the family and this trip
[1:20:43] I I just uh there was something gnawing
[1:20:46] at me to I need to get my wife Kathy um
[1:20:51] back to see her family but yet at the
[1:20:54] same time time I I'm a I like the
[1:20:57] history of the Second World War and I
[1:21:00] had desired to go to aitz I had really
[1:21:04] desired to go Kathy spent probably a
[1:21:07] year you know actually working on the
[1:21:10] trip and a lot of things were not lining
[1:21:14] up and so I wanted to uh it was
[1:21:19] something I had desired well she worked
[1:21:22] Hotel wasn't lining up we couldn't get a
[1:21:24] flight in we couldn't get this we
[1:21:25] couldn't get the train it just it just
[1:21:28] wasn't coming together finances weren't
[1:21:31] coming together
[1:21:33] um and then little by little we we
[1:21:37] talked about it what what if we change
[1:21:39] this and change that and then all of a
[1:21:42] sudden the pieces of the puzzle started
[1:21:44] coming
[1:21:46] together so we we had desired to go to
[1:21:49] uh oshit so Kathy and I um we left tuon
[1:21:56] the the 30th of May of this
[1:22:00] year and our flight was out of Tucson
[1:22:03] which uh we
[1:22:06] left half hour laid out of
[1:22:09] Tucson which wasn't too bad and we had

[1:25:54] I I saw this and this was very
[1:25:58] true those who do not remember the past
[1:26:01] are condemmed to repeat
[1:26:03] it that can even be with our walk with
[1:26:07] the
[1:26:14] Lord this is a pretty renowned picture
[1:26:17] of
[1:26:18] oshits you when you see the
[1:26:22] pictures this was uh this was a Fitz 2
[1:26:25] we went to number one first and we took
[1:26:28] a tour with uh a company and had a young
[1:26:32] man that was just a phenomenal guide I
[1:26:34] still have his
[1:26:37] number and we've kept in contact a
[1:26:40] little bit I need to to reach out to him
[1:26:44] but he um his
[1:26:47] family
[1:26:49] lives up in uh in the close to the
[1:26:52] Ukraine border but they they've been he
[1:26:55] was really concerned but I want you to
[1:26:58] know
[1:27:00] that people watch you as
[1:27:04] Christians you may not think it but
[1:27:06] people are watching you and they're
[1:27:09] going to see how you're going to react
[1:27:11] to
[1:27:14] situations this is the entrance of uh
[1:27:17] the gas chamber to the
[1:27:19] left they would put about 700 people
[1:27:22] here
[1:27:25] I didn't want to go into all the a lot
[1:27:27] of the graphic things
[1:27:29] but the Lord blessed sister Cathy and I
[1:27:32] with about a week a little over a week
[1:27:35] alone we we were able just the two of us
[1:27:38] which we really really needed uh she was
[1:27:42] been extremely busy uh taking care of
[1:27:44] things with work and grandkids and I was
[1:27:46] traveling and it just uh you start
[1:27:49] budding heads because you don't spend
[1:27:51] enough time you sort of grow apart a
[1:27:53] little bit and it was a good time to to
[1:27:58] reconnect this was one of the uh bunks
[1:28:01] in the dormatory where they
[1:28:05] slept it was designed to hold four
[1:28:08] people and often they put seven or eight
[1:28:11] on a bunk like
[1:28:14] this the pray Shaws of those that
[1:28:20] um gave their
[1:28:22] life and it was wasn't just Jewish
[1:28:25] people so often that we hear oh it it's
[1:28:29] just the Jews it wasn't just Jews but
[1:28:32] they were they were the majority brother
[1:28:37] brandham and I'd like to read you a
[1:28:39] little quote
[1:28:44] um it's from the third
[1:28:47] exus brother brandham said and it was in
[1:28:50] Germany and in up into Russia and Italy
[1:28:54] the people rised raised up Joseph's
[1:28:58] Hitler and Stalin melini who hated the
[1:29:02] Jew they had to go back to their
[1:29:05] Homeland God you've got ways of doing
[1:29:09] things that we don't understand I don't
[1:29:12] understand why I went through the things
[1:29:13] in my life I don't understand
[1:29:16] why uh these
[1:29:19] people were massacred were slaughtered
[1:29:22] just because they They Carried the label
[1:29:25] of
[1:29:27] Jew and you press them no home in
[1:29:31] Germany everything taken from them also
[1:29:35] in Italy Russia no place to go and they
[1:29:39] were sent back to their Homeland just to
[1:29:41] fulfill the word oh the loving hand of
[1:29:45] God how sometimes it looks cruel of the
[1:29:49] way that people suffer but it still it's
[1:29:54] the tender hand of Jehovah leading his
[1:29:57] little children we thank you
[1:30:00] Lord had this not happened brothers and
[1:30:04] sisters we probably most likely would
[1:30:07] not H have Israel
[1:30:09] today they wouldn't be in their they
[1:30:12] wouldn't be
[1:30:14] blessed brother Brenham
[1:30:17] says the Jewish people cannot be blessed
[1:30:20] outside their Homeland
[1:30:26] after that we flew in uh we flew to
[1:30:28] Zurich and we spent uh a week in
[1:30:32] interlockin it was a time of
[1:30:36] relaxation Discovery for Kathy and I we
[1:30:38] love to discover things together places
[1:30:41] I'd never seen I mean I I'd seen that
[1:30:43] from there but I'd never actually been
[1:30:45] up to it this is the young
[1:30:51] FR when when we left Tucson we looked at
[1:30:56] the
[1:30:56] weather and it called for rain every
[1:31:00] single day that we were going there we
[1:31:02] took stuffed for the
[1:31:04] rain we had he heavier clothes we
[1:31:07] thought it was going to be cold that's
[1:31:10] why we were
[1:31:11] overweight besides some of the gifts and
[1:31:14] yet we ended up with
[1:31:16] sun the lord gave us every day sunshine
[1:31:21] there was a brief moment in Poland and
[1:31:23] crack out that we had 15 minutes of rain
[1:31:26] and it cleared up every morning sister
[1:31:29] Kathy and I would hold hands in the room
[1:31:32] and we'd commit our day to the Lord and
[1:31:35] ask the Lord to guide us and to grant us
[1:31:37] a good time I was happy with rain I mean
[1:31:40] we we didn't get a lot of rain here in
[1:31:41] two some I'd been happy but uh but the
[1:31:44] lord gave us
[1:31:47] Sunshine then we go uh we spent a week
[1:31:51] in um interlock and then we go see
[1:31:54] brother Fran so this is Brother Fran on
[1:31:58] the right Kathy on the left and his aunt
[1:32:02] Diva 105 years old still going strong
[1:32:06] still loves the
[1:32:07] Lord and
[1:32:09] makes the services every Sunday
[1:32:12] morning at
[1:32:16] 105 now brother uh brother Fran was the
[1:32:20] original translator
[1:32:24] um for brother brandham in the French
[1:32:28] language he has been known or has become
[1:32:31] the voice of brother brandham in the
[1:32:33] French language there was a time that um
[1:32:36] due to some things with the voice of God
[1:32:39] that he wasn't doing it anymore and they
[1:32:42] uh the voice of God tried to get someone
[1:32:44] else to be the voice of brother brandham
[1:32:47] and the people rose up and rebelled
[1:32:49] because maybe it was the acent I I don't
[1:32:52] know but the people wanted brother Fran
[1:32:55] back and to understand this brother Fran
[1:33:00] does
[1:33:02] not have an agenda when he
[1:33:05] translates he may if brother brandham
[1:33:08] accentuates a word brother franell it
[1:33:11] accentuates the the same word he makes
[1:33:15] it as if brother brandham is speaking
[1:33:17] French he keeps it in the same
[1:33:20] atmosphere that it was given he tries to
[1:33:22] make sure that the spirit is the
[1:33:26] same this is Brother franwell
[1:33:30] Church believe it or not he has aund
[1:33:33] about I think 120 people is that right
[1:33:36] Kathy in his church when I I count at
[1:33:40] the chairs it'll all and he can get
[1:33:44] probably about 80 90 people into the
[1:33:46] church and
[1:33:48] it's a third this
[1:33:50] size and they you know they're it's like
[1:33:54] we were back in the days where people
[1:33:57] were just crammed I mean we have he has
[1:34:00] chairs in the aisles chairs in the back
[1:34:02] VES of you chairs on the side wings I
[1:34:04] mean but
[1:34:06] 97 98% of his church is
[1:34:10] African and they can
[1:34:12] worship uh they know how to
[1:34:15] worship
[1:34:21] uh there they're singing I don't I don't
[1:34:23] I don't have the uh the audio on that
[1:34:28] sorry but they uh they get to sing it
[1:34:30] and
[1:34:32] shouting
[1:34:35] and here's a front view of some of the
[1:34:38] brothers uh this brother this white
[1:34:40] brother here uh Brother s used to be um
[1:34:44] a
[1:34:45] trustee uh let's
[1:34:49] see I'm not sure where the all the PO on
[1:34:52] the pointer that's sister Susan right
[1:34:54] there that's Brother s
[1:34:57] hose Kathy's uh to the left of sister
[1:35:00] Susan but uh that's francois's uh
[1:35:06] cousin Sylvia and that's uh Aunt
[1:35:11] Diva uh they got her a recliner uh
[1:35:15] because of her
[1:35:19] age
[1:35:21] so the following Monday after after we
[1:35:24] we arrived um francea is so
[1:35:28] busy and it's hard for him to shut down
[1:35:32] we ended up uh getting him
[1:35:36] uh away for half a day a little over
[1:35:40] half a
[1:35:41] day so we took the boat from uh Neil in
[1:35:45] Switzerland went across the lake into uh
[1:35:49] France
[1:35:51] and it's a very old town
[1:35:54] down and we sat this is the only little
[1:35:57] restaurant that was
[1:35:59] open and the reason I took uh put this
[1:36:02] in here is because we sat
[1:36:05] down and I and I mentioned
[1:36:08] earlier we're being watched as
[1:36:13] Christians so we bowed our heads to pray
[1:36:16] over our food just a simple
[1:36:18] prayer and the waitress came up and says
[1:36:21] you're Christians aren't you
[1:36:24] and brother Francis saides and she
[1:36:27] saidwell so am I God bless you and they
[1:36:30] they built a rapport I he got her number
[1:36:33] I believe and I don't know if he's
[1:36:35] communicated with her but just this the
[1:36:38] fact of saying a prayer bless asking God
[1:36:42] to bless your food can impact someone's
[1:36:48] life over here uh brother alexand uh
[1:36:56] uh this is the song leader with his wife
[1:37:00] brother Spencer's uh like a associate
[1:37:04] pastor
[1:37:06] there brother tal and sister
[1:37:11] Romy and there's a testimony about this
[1:37:14] sister
[1:37:15] here she suffered postpartum depression
[1:37:18] for over a
[1:37:21] year closed up went into
[1:37:26] relle didn't eat a whole lot didn't have
[1:37:28] any communication with
[1:37:32] anybody and through
[1:37:34] prayer of the brothers and sisters God
[1:37:37] delivered her after a year of postpartum
[1:37:41] depression all of a sudden she's happy
[1:37:44] she's
[1:37:45] cheerful wonderful family um they speak
[1:37:50] English brother tal translates for for
[1:37:53] her
[1:37:55] uh brother Spencer here in the middle
[1:37:58] and brother tal they both work for the
[1:38:00] un uh whatever they do you know for the
[1:38:03] UN a a lot of it's in uh the
[1:38:06] technical uh computers and things like
[1:38:12] that now here uh the this is how France
[1:38:17] uh translates the message of brother
[1:38:21] brandham it used to be that
[1:38:25] um the message would be
[1:38:27] translated by a sister in Canada Kathy
[1:38:31] for for about a year uh was part of a
[1:38:34] correction oh part of Translate
[1:38:36] translation
[1:38:38] team and it'd go to France wall and then
[1:38:43] it would it would go to
[1:38:45] Kathy Kathy would proofread it correct
[1:38:48] it it get sent back correct it I don't
[1:38:53] know if uh she did any more Corrections
[1:38:56] and then sister Susan would proofread it
[1:38:59] after and then it would go to voice of
[1:39:02] God and then they'd put it out well now
[1:39:06] what they
[1:39:07] do is voice of God has done something
[1:39:10] with uh art artificial intelligence
[1:39:13] they've got a program now that they they
[1:39:16] take all the sentences they put it into
[1:39:18] a a you know it's in the message is
[1:39:21] inputed computer trans Ates it and then
[1:39:24] it's uh proof red sister Susan will do
[1:39:27] that she'll she'll get it on the
[1:39:30] computer like this this is a little
[1:39:32] laptop and then right here is brother
[1:39:39] brandham and then here uh France wall
[1:39:43] will TR if it's ready to be translated
[1:39:47] France will stand there or
[1:39:50] sit and just like uh you know Kathy's
[1:39:53] having her hand at it and I'm I'm over
[1:39:56] here giving giving it a shot just to see
[1:40:00] what it's
[1:40:01] like and
[1:40:03] um he sits there and translates it but
[1:40:06] it's like a paragraph or a sentence or
[1:40:08] something at a time well if he he makes
[1:40:11] a mistake he can go back erase what he
[1:40:14] can erase this and re-record it and he
[1:40:18] does like one a week so he does four
[1:40:21] messages a month to get it out to the
[1:40:24] French language French is
[1:40:28] the there's more people speaking French
[1:40:32] for the voice of God than there is in
[1:40:35] English so I've SE we've seen the
[1:40:39] evolution of of the translation of the
[1:40:41] ministry now brother franah has a church
[1:40:45] he's also a missionary at the same time
[1:40:48] he does go out but he also does
[1:40:51] this and he kept extremely
[1:40:57] busy well yeah the audio so you don't
[1:41:00] you don't need to hear me uh butcher
[1:41:03] it so where where I was real excited was
[1:41:08] and this this is why I asked brother
[1:41:11] Daniel uh Jr to see me come from east
[1:41:15] and
[1:41:16] west because what this is franois has
[1:41:19] had a burden for the Arabic countries
[1:41:25] and
[1:41:26] so uh this sister's from Switzerland uh
[1:41:30] Kathy's uh by Fran I'm in another room
[1:41:34] this a sister uh this sister here is her
[1:41:37] friend and this Sister Sister Lydia from
[1:41:41] from
[1:41:42] Morocco is translating from French into
[1:41:46] Arabic and then this sister here is from
[1:41:51] Syria
[1:41:55] so we we had the privilege of
[1:41:58] participating in an Arabic Zoom
[1:42:02] meeting France brother franu would
[1:42:05] normally have spoken taken a topic and
[1:42:08] spoke but he asked Kathy and I to give
[1:42:11] our
[1:42:13] testimonies Kathy did really really well
[1:42:16] I got to tell you in
[1:42:18] French and I'll plead the fifth on me
[1:42:23] but it was an honor I want you to know
[1:42:25] it was it was an honor uh even in my
[1:42:28] broken broken French uh the
[1:42:33] sister uh sister Lydia would speak
[1:42:36] English could speak some English she was
[1:42:38] a teacher so I could I could fall sorry
[1:42:42] I could fall in uh
[1:42:44] back as a backup say something in
[1:42:47] English and she would translate
[1:42:49] it now this oops sorry
[1:42:54] this sister here um she sang a little
[1:42:58] special in Arabic AC
[1:43:01] capella and it was so sweet
[1:43:05] um and I have to say I you know all
[1:43:08] living in
[1:43:11] Israel uh with the
[1:43:14] Jews Israelis I became very
[1:43:18] biased sort of built up a guard against
[1:43:21] the Arabs
[1:43:24] brother brandom said this message will
[1:43:26] go in every to every nation and
[1:43:29] tongue and I realize
[1:43:32] that I had to repent of my attitude
[1:43:35] because these are our Brothers and
[1:43:38] Sisters in
[1:43:39] Christ they love the Lord just as much
[1:43:42] as you
[1:43:45] do it's the shed blood of Calvary that
[1:43:47] have saved
[1:43:49] them now this brother here
[1:43:53] we H we
[1:43:56] have Morocco we have
[1:43:59] Algeria this sister's in Syria he's in
[1:44:04] Jordan and I'm not sure where this
[1:44:07] brother's from or that brother but I
[1:44:11] want to say there was probably 20
[1:44:13] different people online for the zoom
[1:44:17] meeting and I'm not sure if some were
[1:44:20] from Egypt or Lebanon I I I I that I
[1:44:23] don't know but this brother brother
[1:44:28] mmud he took his family and had to flee
[1:44:31] for their lives because he was a
[1:44:33] Christian
[1:44:35] he he hadn't been baptized yet but he he
[1:44:38] accepted Jesus Christ as his Lord and
[1:44:41] Savior the reason he fled because he
[1:44:44] used to be a teacher of the
[1:44:46] Quran to teach uh the Muslim faith so he
[1:44:50] left and he went to a different city
[1:44:54] I called brother franell here a couple
[1:44:56] weeks ago and I wanted to find out
[1:44:58] because I was so
[1:45:00] blessed at the
[1:45:02] service um I was truly blessed the I
[1:45:07] really felt the presence of the
[1:45:09] Lord with the test little testimonies
[1:45:12] and the Spirit uh the interaction with
[1:45:15] Francois and the brothers and
[1:45:17] sisters so brother mammut his wife was
[1:45:21] still a Muslim
[1:45:23] she fell hit her head Had a Brain
[1:45:29] Hemorrhage he's a relatively new
[1:45:32] Christian and he sat with her at the
[1:45:34] hospital and prayed all night long he
[1:45:37] prayed and prayed and prayed through the
[1:45:40] night and early in into the morning and
[1:45:44] when he said amen she said amen and then
[1:45:49] went to be with the
[1:45:51] Lord at the very last moment on her
[1:45:57] deathbed I believe she accepted Jesus
[1:46:00] Christ as her
[1:46:03] savior quite distraught over the uh
[1:46:06] passing of his
[1:46:09] wife brother uh the lord gave brother
[1:46:11] mmud uh a dream and in the dream he saw
[1:46:16] his
[1:46:17] wife
[1:46:19] happy at
[1:46:21] peace with the one that she loved and he
[1:46:24] believes that's the Lord Jesus she was
[1:46:28] with the Lord that so I'm sadden that he
[1:46:33] lost his wife but I'm I'm
[1:46:35] rejoicing that heaven got another Angel
[1:46:39] to sing the
[1:46:40] choir this was the train that we
[1:46:42] traveled on oh one like
[1:46:45] this uh that was our main transportation
[1:46:49] around Europe Kathy you know had
[1:46:52] recorded it 223 miles hour uh we had I
[1:46:56] looked up and took a picture at 197 but
[1:47:00] it was quite comfortable uh but that's
[1:47:02] the way we we traveled so a
[1:47:06] lot in Paris we C sister Kathy and I uh
[1:47:11] it we had a time to reconnect with
[1:47:13] family and I was very very happy that
[1:47:16] her sister a baby
[1:47:18] sister lives in the southwest part of
[1:47:21] France uh
[1:47:24] they she had sort of pushed Kathy away
[1:47:27] due to whatever um still don't know but
[1:47:31] it was all right uh when we tra when
[1:47:35] when we had made the plans to go to um
[1:47:40] down it ended up
[1:47:43] that the comment was what me what you're
[1:47:46] not going to come see us and I really
[1:47:49] felt that instead of going to see the
[1:47:50] Lavender Fields that we needed to go see
[1:47:52] her
[1:47:53] sister well we spent three wonderful
[1:47:58] days uh with them both her sister and
[1:48:02] her husband are retired
[1:48:04] lawyers and the two girls reconnected
[1:48:08] after many
[1:48:10] years they talked for three days
[1:48:12] straight I don't know how but they did
[1:48:15] so Kathy and I we were able to reconnect
[1:48:18] with family she saw all her siblings
[1:48:20] except one and then we spent a week in
[1:48:24] Paris this is uh the chapel San
[1:48:30] Chappel it was influenced by
[1:48:34] charlan if I'm saying it right who was
[1:48:36] an early
[1:48:38] Christian and the reason I took these
[1:48:40] pictures and as I told Brother Dan
[1:48:43] because in this Chapel all the way
[1:48:45] around it tells the story of the Old
[1:48:51] Testament um uh this is on the south
[1:48:55] side but this one
[1:48:56] here starting here working all the way
[1:48:59] up tells the Book of
[1:49:01] Genesis in its
[1:49:04] entirety and then it goes
[1:49:06] around uh and we're talking Book of
[1:49:09] Genesis the book of Exodus the Book of
[1:49:11] Numbers then it combines uh the Minor
[1:49:13] Prophets and it goes around and then
[1:49:17] this one
[1:49:18] here is is the story of Esther it's the
[1:49:22] book of ES
[1:49:24] I didn't have I didn't want to put every
[1:49:26] every uh picture in there but but it
[1:49:29] tells the story of the
[1:49:31] Bible and it spoke to
[1:49:34] me uh and
[1:49:37] then this one
[1:49:40] here this picture is the Book of
[1:49:44] Revelations so it tells everything on
[1:49:46] the Old Testament and then ends with the
[1:49:48] Book of Revelations so yeah you can see
[1:49:51] here there's uh
[1:49:54] Genesis Exodus Numbers Deuteronomy
[1:49:58] Joshua Judges then we get into
[1:50:01] Isaiah John the
[1:50:04] Evangelist uh The Passion of Christ is
[1:50:06] in the very middle
[1:50:09] there and then we get uh John the
[1:50:12] Baptist and
[1:50:14] Daniel right
[1:50:16] there and then we go to Ezekiel and uh
[1:50:20] Jeremiah
[1:50:23] job Esther the
[1:50:26] Kings and then
[1:50:29] um the story of the relics of the
[1:50:32] passion on the last one and then it was
[1:50:34] all about uh The Book of Revelation it's
[1:50:36] this this circular one and that's how we
[1:50:39] ended our uh our
[1:50:42] journey the Lord really really blessed
[1:50:44] us we met some wonderful brothers and
[1:50:47] sisters who truly love the Lord and it
[1:50:51] was just a real honor to to reconnect
[1:50:54] with some old friends um I was able to
[1:50:57] reconnect with
[1:50:58] a an Old Co a colleague that uh I used
[1:51:02] to work with when I worked in
[1:51:04] Switzerland and we keep in contact every
[1:51:06] year especially Christmas time and it's
[1:51:09] just non-stop I mean it's just doing
[1:51:11] well he looked really bad but uh it was
[1:51:15] good and it it just it was a real
[1:51:17] blessing to to have to have had the time
[1:51:21] to to get with family to spend the time
[1:51:24] alone to have quality time with my wife
[1:51:28] but for me part of the Highlight was to
[1:51:31] see the brothers and sisters in the
[1:51:33] Arabic
[1:51:35] countries so that that's how our trip
[1:51:37] ended and then we came home and back to
[1:51:39] the Grind so but the Lord's been good to
[1:51:42] us um I have no complaints the Lord has
[1:51:47] truly truly been good the Lord's been
[1:51:50] faithful through all the tests and trial
[1:51:52] we've gone
[1:51:54] through uh the character building it's
[1:51:56] not easy to go through all that but it's
[1:51:59] it's worth it all it is truly worth it
[1:52:02] all so I hope this has been a help don't
[1:52:05] lose hope keep pressing forward the Lord
[1:52:08] will see you through all things Lord
[1:52:11] bless
[1:52:13] [Applause]
[1:52:21] you you want one thing about brother
[1:52:23] Ed's
[1:52:24] testimony he didn't hear one
[1:52:27] complaint he went through a lot as a
[1:52:29] young man and then all the way
[1:52:32] through um with all the trials and
[1:52:35] tribulations but there wasn't a
[1:52:36] complaint it was all like you said it
[1:52:38] was all the character character building
[1:52:41] the Lord has something that he's doing
[1:52:43] in everything that happens to us and
[1:52:46] it's to build our character like brother
[1:52:47] Ed said and I really I really
[1:52:50] appreciated um I really appreciated
[1:52:52] everything from the time that he was a
[1:52:53] boy and he got hurt all the way up until
[1:52:57] now um really man of
[1:53:01] God and and a servant of God and a
[1:53:04] servant of God's people I I wanted to
[1:53:06] mention brother Francois I used to work
[1:53:07] with brother franu and um he said there
[1:53:11] was a bit of an uprising when uh they um
[1:53:15] when he was let go and uh brother
[1:53:18] franois the way that the translations
[1:53:20] work brother franu is is um he's French
[1:53:24] and he's European
[1:53:26] frenchs uh Swiss yeah swisserland in
[1:53:30] Europe I'm just kidding okay swits he's
[1:53:34] Swiss and he and he speaks but he speaks
[1:53:35] a very very clear French now in
[1:53:40] translating brother bram's message the
[1:53:43] French
[1:53:45] language is Far and Away the most
[1:53:47] important language there's 70s something
[1:53:49] different languages that they translate
[1:53:50] to French
[1:53:54] is by far the most important brother Ed
[1:53:58] said that more people speak French that
[1:54:00] listen to brother brandom than English
[1:54:03] that's a bit of an understatement there
[1:54:05] are three million about people that
[1:54:09] claim to believe brother brandom and
[1:54:10] claim to listen to his message of those
[1:54:14] 3 million 2 million speak
[1:54:18] French so it's not only is it more than
[1:54:21] English is more than all the other
[1:54:23] languages
[1:54:25] combined there's a million and a half in
[1:54:28] Congo alone and at least another half a
[1:54:30] million throughout Africa and then just
[1:54:33] a few more in um in Europe very very few
[1:54:36] actually in Europe most of those most of
[1:54:39] those French speakers are um in Africa
[1:54:42] central Africa and he was talking about
[1:54:46] brother France wall in this Arabic work
[1:54:48] he mentioned a little bit but it is a
[1:54:50] very very serious Danger that these
[1:54:53] brothers and sisters go through and I've
[1:54:56] known some of them that have been put in
[1:54:59] prison because of the work that they're
[1:55:01] doing and this sister in Syria and uh
[1:55:04] especially in Syria she'll they'll go to
[1:55:07] jail if if they're lucky they'll go to
[1:55:11] jail so very very serious serious thing
[1:55:15] that they're doing and just Brave we we
[1:55:18] have a very easy here in the United
[1:55:21] States but in uh in those Arabic
[1:55:25] countries they are at the Peril of their
[1:55:28] own lives in what they're doing so
[1:55:30] appreciate what brother France W is
[1:55:31] doing there he mentioned a um an AI work
[1:55:35] uh program that that they're doing that
[1:55:36] they're using now it's called the Omega
[1:55:38] program that um that is helping uh make
[1:55:42] the translations go faster and more
[1:55:44] accurate and uh it was it was really
[1:55:48] nice because my son-in-law wrote the
[1:55:51] program
[1:55:53] not that I'm proud
[1:55:56] but I'm proud I'm proud of him so really
[1:56:00] really really um touched by what brother
[1:56:04] Ed said and uh and how he was able to go
[1:56:06] to Europe and and witness some of this
[1:56:09] hard work that they're doing over there
[1:56:11] and then how that the work that brother
[1:56:13] franois you can see the missionary
[1:56:15] calling the brother Fran wall has in his
[1:56:17] life even reaching out to Northern
[1:56:20] Africa and Morocco and uh Syria and
[1:56:23] Algeria and those different countries
[1:56:26] that um the people still they want to
[1:56:28] hear what brother brandham had to
[1:56:30] say and if there is a need then God will
[1:56:34] provide for that need and he is he is
[1:56:37] truly providing for that do you
[1:56:40] appreciate brother
[1:56:43] Ed man I do I appreciate him every day
