[32:39] Father, that
[32:41] as I read your word and Father, expound
[32:45] on these things and we worship, Lord,
[32:48] just that you would be pleased,
[32:51] our prayers would come up before you as
[32:52] a sweet smelling savor to the Lord.
[32:56] We love you and we thank you, Father, in
[32:59] Jesus Christ's name.
[33:02] Amen. Let's remain standing and uh I
[33:07] want to continue on with the sermon on
[33:09] the mounts. Let's let's read together
[33:11] Matthew chapter 7 and we'll start with
[33:14] verse six and we'll read through verse
[33:16] 14.
[33:20] As you're turning, Daniel, can we sing
[33:22] that I sought the Lord just one more
[33:24] time?
[33:25] &gt;&gt; I sought the Lord
[33:29] and he answered me. me
[33:33] and delivered me
[33:38] from every fear.
[33:42] And those look on him
[33:46] far radian,
[33:50] they'll never be ashamed.
[33:54] They'll never be ashamed. Go magnify.
[33:59] Oh, magnify
[34:02] the Lord
[34:07] &gt;&gt; and come exalt
[34:10] his name
[34:12] together.
[34:15] Oh, glorify
[34:18] the Lord
[34:20] with me.
[34:24] God exalts
[34:26] his name
[34:28] forever.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; Start with verse seven.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; Ask
[34:38] and it shall be given to you.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; Seek and you shall find. Knock and it
[34:44] shall be opened unto you. For everyone
[34:46] that askketh receiveth,
[34:49] and he that seeketh findeth, and to him
[34:52] that knockketh it shall be open. Or what
[34:55] man is there of you whom his son ask
[34:59] bread, will they give him a stone? Or if
[35:00] he ask a fish, will he give him a
[35:02] serpent? If you being evil, if you then
[35:04] being evil, know how to give good gifts
[35:08] unto your children, how much more shall
[35:10] your father which is in heaven give good
[35:12] things to them that ask him. Therefore,
[35:15] all things whatsoever you would that men
[35:18] should do to you,
[35:20] even do even so to them. For this is the
[35:25] law and the prophets.
[35:27] Enter ye in at the straight gate. For
[35:29] wide is the gate, and broad is the way
[35:32] that leadth to destruction, and many
[35:35] there be which go in there. Because
[35:38] straight is the gate, and narrow is the
[35:39] way which leadth unto life, and few

[37:28] And we have two special guests this
[37:32] morning. Um, we've been praying for them
[37:36] for the past few weeks.
[37:39] They've been in critical condition in
[37:42] the hospital
[37:43] and the Lord has touched them and is
[37:49] helping them recover.
[37:51] Where are they? Where's K and Adrien?
[37:54] Where are they at?
[37:56] Oh, they're in the nursery.
[37:59] Bring them out. Lonnie, can you bring
[38:00] them out?
[38:03] Everybody turn around. These are these
[38:05] are the two kids we've been praying for
[38:07] that have been in the hospital.
[38:18] Thank you. The Lord has truly had his
[38:20] hand on that family and I'm looking
[38:23] forward to giving the full testimony of
[38:25] all of this. But it's been it's been
[38:27] just wonderful and to see you sometimes
[38:30] things happen. I woke up this morning
[38:33] and uh I just woke up I woke up in a
[38:35] really good mood and I uh
[38:39] probably one of the things that put me
[38:41] in a good mood is because I usually wake
[38:42] up at about 10 to 5 on Sunday morning
[38:45] and I I go to study and I woke up and I
[38:49] started to uh get up out of bed and I
[38:52] looked and it was 10 to 4. I thought,
[38:54] "All right, I want to I got I got
[38:57] another hour here that that I can
[38:58] spend." And I was able to spend that
[39:00] time just laying in bed and praying and
[39:02] thanking the Lord. And he is he's so
[39:06] friends, he's so good to us.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; You know, we don't we don't give him
[39:10] credit enough for the uh the kindness
[39:14] that that he he's bestows on us just
[39:19] every single day.
[39:21] We've been going through this sermon on
[39:23] the mount and
[39:26] it's uh it's been just it's been a real
[39:30] blessing for me. This is the first
[39:32] recorded sermon we have of Jesus. And
[39:34] what Jesus has done in this sermon is he
[39:38] has taken this the Old Testament and he
[39:41] has really made it to where it makes
[39:43] sense and he's made it understandable
[39:44] for all of us. And he last week we
[39:47] talked about judge not that you be not
[39:51] judged.
[39:53] And now Jesus is going to get into
[39:57] prayer. And he if we remember from the
[40:00] previous chapter he already talked about
[40:04] prayer and he even gave us the Lord's
[40:07] prayer.
[40:08] Our father who art in heaven hallowed be
[40:10] thy name thy kingdom come thy will be
[40:12] done. and and he taught taught us how to
[40:16] pray there. And if you read in your
[40:19] Bible,
[40:21] you will never find another character in
[40:24] the Bible that prayed as much as Jesus
[40:27] Christ.
[40:29] Can you imagine? God in flesh comes
[40:32] down. God comes down in flesh,
[40:34] manifested himself in the perfect
[40:40] the the perfect lamb of God. ever sinned
[40:43] &gt;&gt; in his whole life. Overcame
[40:46] sin, overcame death, overcame hell,
[40:48] overcame the grave. And yet this man
[40:53] prayed more than anyone else.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; And he was our example and we look at we
[41:00] look at
[41:02] how he how he did things and and just
[41:05] his his the
[41:07] perfection that was in Jesus. And here
[41:10] he is on the north shore of the Sea of
[41:12] Galilee.
[41:14] And it started he sat down with his
[41:18] disciples and his disciples gathered
[41:20] around him and he started teaching. And
[41:23] then by the end of the sermon we see
[41:24] that there was multitudes all around and
[41:27] Jesus was teaching them these things.
[41:29] And
[41:31] we uh we got to through last week we got
[41:36] to that uh we shouldn't be judging each
[41:38] other.
[41:40] And Jesus actually commanded that that
[41:42] you judge not that you be not judged.
[41:45] And now
[41:47] he's uh he's getting to in this what he
[41:50] what he said in Matthew 6 about prayer.
[41:52] He's going to revisit prayer again in ma
[41:54] in in chapter 7. But in chapter six he
[41:57] says he says be sincere when you pray.
[42:01] He says go into the closet and in secret
[42:06] and pray there. He said, he said, "Of
[42:08] course we pray openly, but he said,
[42:12] don't pray openly to lift yourself up."
[42:15] He says, "Because when you do that,
[42:18] you're just doing it to make yourself
[42:19] look good and you have your reward.
[42:23] You've rewarded yourself. But if you go
[42:25] in secret and you're sincere and you
[42:28] pray in secret, then God will reward
[42:31] you. God will answer your prayer."
[42:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And now we get to chapter 7 and
[42:39] he says this in verse seven. He says,
[42:43] "Ask
[42:44] and it shall be given you."
[42:47] He says, "Seek
[42:49] and ye shall find."
[42:51] &gt;&gt; He says, "Knock and it shall be opened
[42:54] unto you. For everyone that askketh
[42:56] receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth,
[42:58] and to him that knockketh it shall be
[43:00] open." So he says these three words. He
[43:02] says, "Ask, seek, and knock." They're
[43:06] three words that have very different
[43:07] meanings. And they're they're what they
[43:10] are is they are the the building blocks
[43:14] really in a successful prayer. You'll
[43:15] notice the intensity of the word starts
[43:18] getting more and more as he goes on.
[43:21] Ask,
[43:23] really simple, very common thing. and
[43:26] then seek
[43:28] and and then at the end knock say okay I
[43:33] I'm I I need this
[43:36] um it starts with something simple and
[43:39] really it becomes more and more
[43:40] passionate as you go. So there is a
[43:43] progression of prayer and that
[43:45] progression can be seen anywhere. I had
[43:47] a contractor not too long ago. He did
[43:49] some work at my house
[43:51] and he uh he wanted to get paid. He
[43:54] wanted to get paid in cash. So he calls
[43:57] me up and he says, "Hey, I I finished
[44:00] the job." He says, "I'd like to get
[44:01] paid." He asked me and I said, "Okay." I
[44:06] said, "Uh, come on by and uh I'll get
[44:09] the cash and I will I'll give it to you
[44:12] when you get here."
[44:13] So
[44:15] he had he had asked and then he gets in
[44:18] his vehicle and he's he lives over on
[44:20] the other side of Tucson from where I
[44:22] live and he drives and and through this
[44:27] journey. He has to make an effort.
[44:31] He's seeking. He's he's going after what
[44:34] what the promise is that that he's going
[44:36] to get paid. And he goes and he he he
[44:40] finally gets to my house. And then when
[44:42] he gets to my door, now he's
[44:44] accomplished it. And now he knocks
[44:48] at my door to get what is promised to
[44:50] him.
[44:52] And that's with our progression, with
[44:54] our prayer.
[44:56] When we ask, we don't necessarily
[44:59] think that it's just going to be given
[45:01] to us right there.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Ask." But then he said,
[45:04] "Seek." And this seek, this seeking may
[45:08] go on for it may go on for days. It may
[45:10] go on for months. It may go on for years
[45:12] or even decades.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; But that seeking is part of prayer.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; And then when you finally get there, you
[45:22] knock at the door of the Lord and you
[45:24] are ready to receive what he has for
[45:27] you.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; There's a parable in Luke chapter 18.
[45:31] I'll read it. I'll read the New King
[45:33] James Version. Lukeapter 18 verse1 says
[45:36] this. He's talking about this parable of
[45:38] the persistent widow.
[45:41] And he spoke a parable to them that the
[45:43] men always ought to pray and not lose
[45:45] heart, saying, "There was in a certain
[45:48] city a judge who did not fear God nor
[45:50] regard man. Now there was a widow in
[45:53] that city, and she came into him,
[45:55] saying, Get justice for me from my
[45:57] adversary." And he would not for a
[46:00] while. But afterward he said within
[46:01] himself, "Though I do not fear God nor
[46:04] regard men, yet because this widow
[46:06] troubles me, I will avenge her, lest by
[46:09] her continuing coming she wearies me."
[46:12] Then the Lord said, "Hear what the
[46:14] unjust judge said."
[46:17] And shall God not avenge his own elect
[46:20] who cry out day and night to him, though
[46:24] he bears long with them. It's not
[46:27] immediate.
[46:29] I tell you that he will avenge them
[46:31] speedily. Nevertheless, when the son of
[46:33] man comes, will he really will he find
[46:38] faith on earth?
[46:39] &gt;&gt; What a statement.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; So Jesus is giving this example. He's
[46:44] not saying that God doesn't care about
[46:46] our needs. That's not the point of of of
[46:49] the parable. He's saying that if you
[46:52] don't get, if you're not receiving, he
[46:55] says, "Keep asking, keep pressing, keep
[46:58] moving because it's this is a normal
[47:01] thing." And this widow, she asked and
[47:02] she asked and she asked. Then finally,
[47:06] at the right time, the judge gave her
[47:09] what she needed.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; And Jesus is saying that. He's saying,
[47:12] "Don't stop. Don't stop asking." I mean,
[47:14] one of the greatest blessings that we
[47:16] have in prayer
[47:18] is just going through the motions. Not
[47:22] going through the motions, but praying
[47:24] is asking. We go and we ask
[47:28] and then it's say sickness say for the
[47:31] kids and we've been praying for them.
[47:33] Going before the Lord on behalf of
[47:36] someone else,
[47:38] &gt;&gt; you're praying and you're asking God.
[47:41] You are in the presence of God. you are
[47:43] being blessed by being in his presence.
[47:46] You're seeking during that time. Or if
[47:48] you're you're sick and and you're you're
[47:50] um asking the Lord to heal yourself or
[47:52] heal a loved one or or asking a loved
[47:54] one to um asking the Lord to bring a
[47:57] loved one to the Lord, then the the
[48:00] greatest blessing is going before the
[48:02] Lord and praying and seeking. And then
[48:06] we have to re we have to remember that
[48:08] God will answer.
[48:12] But he does it in his time.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; The Apostle Paul, he had an ailment.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; Probably really something seriously that
[48:20] hindered him. It hindered him every day.
[48:22] He called it a thorn in his flesh. He
[48:24] called it a measure, a uh messenger of
[48:27] Satan that consistently buffeted him all
[48:30] the time. And he said, "I sought the
[48:33] Lord." The the song we just sang, Paul
[48:36] said, "I sought the Lord." Three times
[48:39] asking God. He was asking. He was asking
[48:42] and then
[48:44] seeking Lord what is this? And then
[48:47] finally Paul realized finally he came to
[48:50] the revelation.
[48:52] He came the the Lord answered him and
[48:54] said, "No, Paul,
[48:56] this weakness that you have, this thorn
[49:00] in your flesh, this messenger from
[49:02] Satan, this is for your own good, Paul."
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Or else
[49:09] &gt;&gt; you'd get lifted up yourself.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Or else you'd maybe think too highly of
[49:14] yourself, Paul.
[49:16] So this was actually this problem that
[49:19] he had was actually a gift from God. And
[49:22] Paul said that he says I sought the Lord
[49:24] three times. He kept asking he kept he
[49:26] kept seeking the Lord and basically this
[49:29] was no this was for good.
[49:33] But Billy Paul used to say
[49:36] always about when he would talk about
[49:38] prayer he would always say this. He'd
[49:40] always say that you'll receive one of
[49:42] three answers. You'll receive a yes.
[49:45] you'll receive a no or you'll receive a
[49:49] wait. And that's how it is when we're
[49:52] praying. And many times, probably most
[49:54] of the time, we get that wait.
[49:57] But to receive an answer, we have to
[50:00] continually as Paul did, he continued to
[50:02] go before the Lord. James said
[50:07] that you don't receive because you don't
[50:09] ask. And that's that's really it's it's
[50:12] it's part of prayer. It's part of living
[50:15] our lives. God requires prayer. You
[50:18] think that why don't why doesn't he just
[50:19] do it? It's like, I have a need. Lord,
[50:22] why don't you just give it to me? Or my
[50:25] friend has a need. Why do I have to ask
[50:28] on his behalf? It's because he's a
[50:30] father and he has children
[50:34] &gt;&gt; and he wants his children to work
[50:36] together. wants his children to love one
[50:38] another
[50:39] &gt;&gt; and he wants his he wants us to be
[50:41] dependent on each other because we all
[50:43] collectively make up the body and if
[50:46] we're praying for one another it brings
[50:47] us together but otherwise we would just
[50:50] be individuals and friends it wouldn't
[50:53] be as good
[50:54] &gt;&gt; but it's God's way
[50:57] then really bringing being for me
[51:00] bringing being in the ministry for the
[51:01] past 20 years and praying with a lot of
[51:04] people I've learned learned that many
[51:08] people they just think they think about
[51:10] what they need
[51:13] rather than praying about it.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; They they replace the conversation with
[51:20] the Lord with just their thoughts and
[51:23] their worry. That's not prayer because
[51:27] you're thinking about something all the
[51:28] time. That's not going before the Lord.
[51:30] That's just worrying. And Jesus said, we
[51:33] we learned in the sermon on the mount a
[51:35] few weeks ago that worrying doesn't do
[51:37] anything, but really praying does
[51:40] everything.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; James chapter 4, let's read what James
[51:45] says about prayer. He says this. James
[51:48] chapter 4:1.
[51:50] From whence come wars and fighting among
[51:52] you? Come not hence even of your lusts
[51:56] that war in your members.
[51:59] You lust. You see how
[52:02] that when we pray, it's going to bring
[52:05] us together. You lust and you have not.
[52:07] You kill and you desire to have and
[52:10] cannot cannot obtain. You fight and war
[52:13] yet you have not because you ask not.
[52:18] And we worry, we talk about things that
[52:20] stress us out. We ask others to pray,
[52:24] but we don't receive an answer to our
[52:29] prayers because we're not asking.
[52:33] We're not really going before the Lord.
[52:34] We're just worrying. We're just
[52:36] thinking.
[52:38] You ask
[52:41] and receive not because you ask a miss
[52:44] that you may consume it upon your lust.
[52:46] English Standard Version of that says,
[52:48] "You ask and do not receive because you
[52:50] ask wrongly to spend it on your own
[52:52] passions."
[52:55] Do you see? We're going to get to a
[52:58] place as we go through what Jesus taught
[53:00] and what the apostles taught. We're
[53:02] going to get to a place that the key to
[53:03] prayer is finding God's will on these
[53:06] things.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; And not our will.
[53:10] John chapter 5:14 says, "And this is the
[53:13] confidence that we have in him, that if
[53:15] we ask anything according to his will
[53:20] that he hears us."
[53:25] &gt;&gt; And then we might ask, "Lord, I've
[53:29] prayed and I've asked maybe are you
[53:32] saying that you don't want me to be
[53:33] healed?"
[53:34] I don't know.
[53:36] I mean, I when I pray for somebody, I
[53:38] want everybody to be healed. But what
[53:40] does God want? We seek his will. Just
[53:43] like the Apostle Paul, he sought the
[53:45] will of the Lord. But but God says, "No,
[53:47] no, no. My grace is sufficient for you,
[53:49] Paul. I have allowed this for your own
[53:52] good and probably for the good of
[53:54] everyone else."
[53:56] We always want,
[53:58] it's our nature. We always want to speak
[54:00] for God,
[54:03] but God speaks for himself.
[54:05] We are not his ruler. There is no
[54:08] brother, you just believe it. You just
[54:09] speak the word. No, no, no, no, no.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; You wait on God.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; You seek God. You seek his answer. And
[54:19] then when you have his answer, then the
[54:22] spirit will speak through you. And that
[54:24] will be the case. But the spirit has to
[54:26] speak through you. It's not you. It's
[54:28] not it's not somebody saying just speak
[54:30] the word. No, no, no, no, no. God speaks
[54:33] the word. And he speaks the word through
[54:34] the individual.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; That is seeking the will of God.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; He is our ruler. And we want to know
[54:43] what he has chosen for us.
[54:46] Might be choosing a church.
[54:49] It might be
[54:52] we we say, "Lord, what is your will for
[54:54] me? Where do you want me to go?" It
[54:57] might be choosing a spouse.
[54:59] Lord, what is your will? I like this
[55:01] boy. I like this girl. But Lord, what
[55:03] have you chosen for me? If we would
[55:07] approach marriage like that, there would
[55:10] be no divorces. Literally, there would
[55:13] be none
[55:14] &gt;&gt; if we approached God like that.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Healing. Lord, please heal my loved one.
[55:21] But I know that you have a purpose in
[55:24] all of this. Most importantly, Lord,
[55:26] accomplish this purpose that you have.
[55:29] That's the most important because we're
[55:31] eventually going to get sick and die
[55:32] even if I we get healed. But you have a
[55:35] great plan in all of this and you know
[55:37] the beginning and you know the end and
[55:39] you know what we need to get to that
[55:41] place and it may be suffering hardships.
[55:44] Verse number 15 in Matthew 7 says this.
[55:49] And if we know that he hears us,
[55:52] whatsoever we ask, we know that we have
[55:56] the petitions that we desired of him.
[56:03] So if we ask and we seek his will and we
[56:06] find his will, then whatever we ask is
[56:08] ours. I'm sorry, that was in first John.
[56:15] And as as we get into this, I'm going to
[56:17] give a couple examples that are going to
[56:19] relate to many of you. And we have to
[56:22] ask ourselves and I all I often ask when
[56:26] Lord when I'm asking you and then I'm
[56:30] seeking your will,
[56:32] do I really trust you?
[56:34] Do I really trust God to provide what I
[56:37] need? Because it's a promise that Jesus
[56:39] said that he's going to provide for you.
[56:41] So Lord, do I trust you or am I going to
[56:43] worry or am I going to make these things
[56:46] happen?
[56:49] Isaiah chapter 40, we all know this that
[56:54] they that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[56:56] their faith. I want to give a story that
[57:01] I hope will encourage you. It's it's a
[57:03] famous story. It's read almost every
[57:06] Christmas, but there's a couple there's
[57:09] one little detail in this story that you
[57:12] may not have noticed, and that's a story
[57:14] of Zachariah and Elizabeth, the parents
[57:16] of John the Baptist. Both were very old.
[57:20] And the angel of the Lord came to
[57:23] Zachchariah and told him that he was
[57:25] going to have a son. Let me read it.
[57:27] Luke 1 verse 9 says this.
[57:33] Zachchariah was a priest and according
[57:35] to the custom of the priest's offices
[57:37] office his lot was to burn incense when
[57:40] he went to the temple
[57:43] of the Lord and the whole multitude of
[57:45] the people were praying without without
[57:48] at the time of incense. So they were
[57:50] outside. Zachchariah was inside. And
[57:52] there appeared unto him an angel of the
[57:54] Lord standing on the right side of the
[57:55] altar of incense. And when Zachariah saw
[57:57] him, he was troubled and fear fell upon
[57:59] him. But the angel said unto him, "Fear
[58:02] not, Zacharias,
[58:04] for thy prayer is heard,
[58:07] and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a
[58:09] son, and shall call his name John, and
[58:13] thou shalt have joy and gladness, and
[58:16] many shall rejoice at his birth. For he
[58:18] shall be great in the sight of the Lord,
[58:20] and shall drink neither wine nor strong
[58:22] drink, and he shall be filled with the
[58:23] Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.
[58:26] And many of the children of Israel shall
[58:28] turn to the Lord their God. And he shall
[58:31] go before him in the spirit and the
[58:33] power of Elias to turn the hearts of the
[58:35] fathers to the children and the
[58:37] disobedient to the wisdom of the just to
[58:39] make ready a people prepared for the
[58:41] Lord. And Zachcharias said unto the
[58:43] angel, "Whereby shall I know this? For I
[58:46] am an old man, and my wife is well
[58:48] stricken in years."
[58:50] There's a detail
[58:53] in there that I want to point out. When
[58:55] the angel came to Zachchariah, what did
[58:57] he say? He said, "God heard your
[59:00] prayer."
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Do you think Zachariah 70, 80 years old
[59:05] or whatever he was, do you think he was
[59:07] praying that God would send him a son?
[59:10] The answer is no.
[59:13] But God heard his prayer maybe when he
[59:16] got married when he was 20 years old.
[59:19] And he and his wife Elizabeth, they were
[59:21] praying for a son. They were praying for
[59:24] a baby where they couldn't have
[59:25] children. They prayed. They asked, they
[59:30] sought the Lord.
[59:32] And time went on
[59:35] and then they maybe stopped praying
[59:37] about. We know they stopped praying
[59:39] about it because if he would have prayed
[59:41] about it this day and here comes the
[59:43] angel says, "Ah, the Lord heard your
[59:45] prayer, Zachariah." He'd be like,
[59:47] "Awesome."
[59:49] But no, he argued with the angel and he
[59:53] says, "Wait a minute. We're old. How can
[59:55] this be? It was because God had a
[59:59] perfect time and he hears our prayers."
[1:00:01] He does. But it is in his time that he
[1:00:05] answers our prayers. So you might be
[1:00:07] praying for a loved one. You might be
[1:00:08] praying for healing. You might be
[1:00:09] praying for whatever it is. God hears
[1:00:12] it. And if you're praying and and you're
[1:00:15] asking the Lord, you're seeking the
[1:00:16] Lord, Lord, what is your will in this
[1:00:19] and you're placing it at the altar of
[1:00:21] the Lord and saying,"Lord, I want the
[1:00:24] salvation of my son." And let me tell
[1:00:25] you, that is always the Lord's will to
[1:00:27] pray for someone's salvation.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Always.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus himself would that all
[1:00:34] men would be saved.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; That's right. So if we are praying for
[1:00:37] the salvation of a loved one or or
[1:00:39] whoever it may be, then we are praying
[1:00:42] for the right thing, pray that in faith,
[1:00:45] bring it to the Lord and then leave it
[1:00:47] there and he will do it as he wants.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; There's a scripture that I skipped in uh
[1:00:54] in in Matthew chapter 7 and that is
[1:00:57] don't
[1:00:59] cast your pearls before swine.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Don't give the things of God to the
[1:01:04] dogs. Amen.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; It's Jewish hyperbole.
[1:01:09] And what the Lord Jesus, I believe, is
[1:01:11] saying is that if you pray and if maybe
[1:01:16] you present the word of the Lord to a
[1:01:18] friend or to a family member and they
[1:01:21] they turn you down, don't get
[1:01:24] discouraged
[1:01:26] because they don't understand it yet.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; A a pig doesn't understand the value of
[1:01:34] pearls.
[1:01:35] Jesus is not telling us to call someone
[1:01:37] a pig. He's not.
[1:01:41] And when we say don't cast your pearls
[1:01:43] before swine, he's not telling you to
[1:01:44] put somebody down. He's saying that they
[1:01:47] don't understand it yet or else. And
[1:01:50] then then he says that if you keep on
[1:01:52] and you go in there, it's like you're in
[1:01:54] the pig pin. This hog's going to come
[1:01:56] and he's going to take you out because
[1:01:59] he doesn't understand what you're trying
[1:02:01] to do.
[1:02:02] So Jesus is telling us just be patient
[1:02:05] here.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Don't continue to push and push because
[1:02:09] you're going to make them mad and
[1:02:11] they're going to come back at you. And
[1:02:13] here is Zachchariah
[1:02:16] and he had prayed and prayed and prayed.
[1:02:19] We know that. We know he had prayed for
[1:02:21] this. And here comes the angel down.
[1:02:25] What an amazing thing. Here's this old
[1:02:28] man standing there. this old priest
[1:02:32] um in this this the the the the back as
[1:02:36] brother Li is going through the the
[1:02:38] tabernacle in the wilderness. The temple
[1:02:40] was set up in the same way where there's
[1:02:41] this room where the the priest goes in
[1:02:44] and here he is in in the back and here
[1:02:47] comes this angel and he says,
[1:02:48] "Zachariah,"
[1:02:50] he says, "God heard your prayer. He's
[1:02:52] going to give you a son and he's going
[1:02:54] to be great."
[1:02:58] And Zachariah had really lost faith.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Never lose faith.
[1:03:06] It could be one year.
[1:03:09] It could be 10 years. You could die
[1:03:13] and go on.
[1:03:16] But God still heard your prayer.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; And if it is his will what you are
[1:03:23] praying, as the Apostle John says, then
[1:03:25] you can rest assured that he heard you.
[1:03:28] and he will answer.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; But have patience. That time of seeking
[1:03:33] is a wonderful time. You're seeking
[1:03:36] Lord. Lord, I want your will. What is
[1:03:39] your will for my son or my daughter?
[1:03:40] What is your will for my job? What is
[1:03:42] your will for a spouse? Lord, I'm
[1:03:44] seeking you. I want what is just you.
[1:03:46] And that is way you can see the
[1:03:48] operation of the Holy Spirit in the
[1:03:50] individual when you are able to just set
[1:03:53] aside your own thoughts, set aside your
[1:03:56] own desires and say, "Lord, here it is.
[1:03:59] Lord, I am at your mercy."
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; And then you watch what God does. I tell
[1:04:04] the story about I gave my heart to the
[1:04:07] Lord on my 21st birthday
[1:04:11] and I uh
[1:04:14] was it was late at night
[1:04:17] and I was um I was in my in my room
[1:04:21] there and I was praying and and I said,
[1:04:24] "Lord, I'm finished with the sin.
[1:04:26] I'm not doing it anymore."
[1:04:30] And then I said, "I want a wife.
[1:04:33] I want, Lord, give me give me a give me
[1:04:36] a spouse. This is what I want. I'm I'm
[1:04:38] almost finished with college. It's um
[1:04:40] it's time that I can start moving on to
[1:04:42] the next portion of my life where I can
[1:04:44] start supporting a family. I want it. I
[1:04:46] want to have kids and I I Lord, I I want
[1:04:49] it. But then I said this. I said, "But
[1:04:52] even if you don't give me one, I'm still
[1:04:54] going to serve you." So I get up next
[1:04:57] day, it's like I'm starting to go to
[1:04:59] church now. I'm gonna find me a good
[1:05:01] girl.
[1:05:03] And uh started going to church and man,
[1:05:06] she didn't show up.
[1:05:11] What's going on here? I prayed. I gave
[1:05:14] my heart to the Lord. I'm still I'm
[1:05:15] living right. Well, where is she?
[1:05:19] A year went by now. I'm 22. I'm getting
[1:05:21] old.
[1:05:25] The girls think that. Guys don't care.
[1:05:28] I'm getting old. I'm 22 years old. I got
[1:05:31] to have my wife. And then I graduated.
[1:05:33] It's like, yeah, I'm an engineer. Yeah,
[1:05:35] I'm making money now. Where's Where's my
[1:05:36] wife?
[1:05:39] I'm 23.
[1:05:41] Wait a minute, Lord. Lord, do you
[1:05:43] remember when I was back there and I,
[1:05:46] you know, I prayed
[1:05:49] and you heard me. Now I'm seeking your
[1:05:52] will. Lord, where where are you? And
[1:05:54] then girls would show up and I'd say,
[1:05:56] "Hey," you know, and no, that's not the
[1:05:59] one.
[1:06:01] And then I'm 25.
[1:06:07] Do you remember?
[1:06:10] And then he might have said, and I think
[1:06:14] I heard him say a couple times, "But do
[1:06:15] you remember what you said that even if
[1:06:17] I don't?"
[1:06:20] So more I prayed and more I I prayed and
[1:06:24] seeking man 26 I am over the hill
[1:06:31] and she's not here.
[1:06:35] And then 27
[1:06:38] and I meet this
[1:06:40] pretty girl from the Tucson Tabernacle
[1:06:43] at a uh a volleyball
[1:06:46] gathering
[1:06:48] and uh we start talking and then
[1:06:52] next year we got married.
[1:06:56] But when I was 21 and I prayed, I wasn't
[1:06:59] ready.
[1:07:01] 21 years old. And I look back and I
[1:07:04] thought I was ready, but I wasn't ready.
[1:07:06] So when I was 21 and I prayed, she
[1:07:10] wasn't ready either.
[1:07:12] You know why? She was 14.
[1:07:20] That would have been weird. A
[1:07:21] 21-year-old and a 14-year-old.
[1:07:24] So, she had to get older
[1:07:28] and I had to mature in the Lord.
[1:07:32] But we wait just like Zachchariah. We we
[1:07:36] lay our requests before the Lord and
[1:07:38] then he answers and and he gives us what
[1:07:41] we need and he gives us what we need at
[1:07:44] the right time.
[1:07:47] One of the most really the really the
[1:07:49] most wonderful thing in in praying and
[1:07:53] in going going through this progression
[1:07:54] of asking the Lord and seeking the Lord
[1:07:58] and then knocking is is the whole
[1:08:00] process. So I spent all of those years
[1:08:03] maturing as a man, getting closer to
[1:08:06] God, praying more, asking Lord, what do
[1:08:11] I do about my job? What do I do? Do I
[1:08:13] need to move out of Tucson to find to
[1:08:15] find a girl? Lord, what is your will in
[1:08:19] my life? And it was it made me a better
[1:08:22] character person
[1:08:24] seeking, asking and seeking. And then
[1:08:28] finally when I met her,
[1:08:30] I remember
[1:08:33] the night when I got on my knees and
[1:08:39] I said, "Lord,
[1:08:41] can I get married?
[1:08:44] I believe you've provided this girl for
[1:08:46] me. Lord, can I marry her?"
[1:08:51] And then
[1:08:53] you notice ask, seek, and knock.
[1:08:57] When you're knocking it, you have the
[1:08:59] understanding that the door's closed.
[1:09:03] And here I am, and I knock
[1:09:06] and he opened the door.
[1:09:08] And he gave me the desire of my heart.
[1:09:12] And sometimes that that desire,
[1:09:15] it really could be, Lord, I need
[1:09:17] deliverance.
[1:09:18] I need deliverance from a dependency. I
[1:09:20] need deliverance from a secret sin. I
[1:09:23] need I need deliverance from from worry,
[1:09:26] from from anxiety. Lord, I need
[1:09:28] deliverance. And there and going through
[1:09:31] all of this time and suffering, the time
[1:09:33] that you suffer, it's building your
[1:09:35] character. And God is accomplishing
[1:09:37] something in your life. He's maturing
[1:09:39] you as a Christian. And then finally you
[1:09:43] say,"Lord, now I have sought you all of
[1:09:46] these years and here I am." And Jesus
[1:09:49] says, "Now you knock and it shall be
[1:09:53] open to you."
[1:09:55] And there you are. And then you receive.
[1:10:00] Back to Matthew 7. Ask and it shall be
[1:10:03] given you. Seek and you shall find.
[1:10:06] Knock and it shall be opened unto you.
[1:10:09] For everyone that askketh receiveth, and
[1:10:12] he that seeketh findeth, and to him that
[1:10:14] knockketh it shall be opened. So Jesus
[1:10:17] is not saying that you're going to get
[1:10:19] whatever you ask for. That's the
[1:10:21] farthest thing in the world. Prayer is,
[1:10:23] as I've said, prayer is about finding
[1:10:25] the will of God because that is what's
[1:10:28] best, not our desires. We have to
[1:10:31] understand that God the father who he
[1:10:33] wants the best for his children.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; That is the key to prayer.
[1:10:39] Hebrews chapter 11 says this, "But
[1:10:42] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:10:43] him. For he who comes to God must
[1:10:46] believe that he is and that he is a
[1:10:49] rewarder of those who diligently seek
[1:10:53] him.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Diligently seek him. Sometimes our
[1:10:59] prayers are answered like this
[1:11:02] and literally sometimes we pass from
[1:11:04] this world
[1:11:06] but they are answered.
[1:11:08] Verse number nine.
[1:11:11] Or what man is there of you whom his son
[1:11:14] askked bread will he give him a stone?
[1:11:18] Or if he ask a fish will he give him a
[1:11:20] serpent? If then being evil,
[1:11:24] if then if you then being evil know how
[1:11:27] to get give good gifts unto your
[1:11:29] children, how much more shall your
[1:11:32] father which is in heaven give good
[1:11:34] gifts to them that ask him?
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; He's telling us that the Lord knows what
[1:11:40] is best. We ask, we seek, we knock, and
[1:11:44] then he answers the prayer according to
[1:11:46] his will. Amen.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; That is the key, friends. That is the
[1:11:51] key to prayer. That is the key to
[1:11:54] seeking God. That is the a key to a
[1:11:56] career. It's a key to a marriage. It's
[1:11:58] the it's a key to a church. Everything
[1:12:00] has that key that Lord, I am setting my
[1:12:03] my own desires, my own beliefs, my own
[1:12:06] thoughts. I am setting these aside. I am
[1:12:08] surrendering to you now. Lord, whatever
[1:12:11] you do, whatever you give, I am fine
[1:12:14] with. Amen.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; And praying like me and praying for a
[1:12:17] wife. I'm not saying I deserved one. I
[1:12:21] even said, "Lord, but even if you don't,
[1:12:25] the Hebrew children when they went to
[1:12:27] the fiery furnace,"
[1:12:29] do you remember what they said?
[1:12:32] Nebuchadnezzar's there and he's cast
[1:12:34] them in there because they're not bowing
[1:12:35] to to my statue.
[1:12:38] They said, "Listen, God is able to
[1:12:41] deliver us. right
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; here are the the guards and they have
[1:12:44] the three young men and they're about to
[1:12:46] cast them into this furnace to burn them
[1:12:49] to to ashes and they're and they're
[1:12:52] saying you know what God's able to
[1:12:53] deliver us of this but then they said
[1:12:55] this but
[1:12:58] even if he doesn't we're not going to
[1:13:01] bow down to your image
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; that is the place that we have to be
[1:13:06] when we are praying for something Lord
[1:13:08] here's what I want
[1:13:11] But Lord, what do you want?
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Here's what I want for a church, but
[1:13:17] Lord, what do you want in this church?
[1:13:19] And how can I how can I help? How can I
[1:13:21] serve? Here's what I want for my family,
[1:13:24] but Lord, what do you want?
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; I was going to go into the golden rule,
[1:13:34] um, which is very important. And we'll
[1:13:36] go into this next week where Jesus
[1:13:40] says, he says, "Therefore, all things
[1:13:43] whatsoever you would that men should do
[1:13:45] to you,
[1:13:46] do ye even so to them, for this is the
[1:13:49] law and the prophets." I don't believe
[1:13:52] there's any way that we can do that
[1:13:54] without doing what he said previous to
[1:13:56] that, which is prayer,
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; which is seeking, asking, and seeking,
[1:14:00] and knocking. Remember in uh the book of
[1:14:02] Revelation, he says, "Whoever knocks, it
[1:14:06] shall be open to him."
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; And it's knocking. These these words in
[1:14:11] in the Greek, they're not a one-time
[1:14:14] thing. It's ask and keep asking. Seek
[1:14:17] and keep seeking. Knock and keep
[1:14:20] knocking. He wants us to do that. You
[1:14:23] know what else it does? It produces
[1:14:25] fellowship between us and God.
[1:14:28] So many times it's the hard times that
[1:14:30] really bring us close to God. And it's
[1:14:33] the easy times where we let our prayer
[1:14:35] life slip. But God by his grace and by
[1:14:38] his love, he will bring hard times on a
[1:14:43] family so that we can surrender. I've
[1:14:47] seen it in I've seen it in uh in this
[1:14:51] this family that we've been praying for.
[1:14:54] It's I'm not saying that I think they
[1:14:57] were they were wonderful. They were
[1:14:58] wonderful Christians before, but now
[1:15:02] they you can't do anything.
[1:15:05] Lord, this is all you.
[1:15:07] We do what we can, but now we just
[1:15:09] surrender to you. And Lord, you're going
[1:15:11] to have to do this because I don't have
[1:15:13] the power to do it. The doctors don't
[1:15:14] have the power to do it. Lord, this is
[1:15:16] this is now in your this is in your
[1:15:19] hands. Like the Hebrew children, they
[1:15:22] come to the fiery furnace. Lord, this is
[1:15:24] yours.
[1:15:26] We don't know what to do. And then he
[1:15:28] comes through
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; in a mighty way.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Miracles, friends, are for today, just
[1:15:34] as they were for for 3,000 years ago,
[1:15:38] for 2,000 years ago, if we would just
[1:15:41] trust him, if we would just put it into
[1:15:43] his hands. You watch what God can do.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Take it out of your hands and place it
[1:15:49] into his hands. And and let me tell you
[1:15:51] something. Ask abundantly as John said
[1:15:54] that your joy may be full.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; He is able
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; and he will do it
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; if we ask the book of John, first John
[1:16:04] says, according to his will. Amen. I'm
[1:16:08] looking forward to getting into I was
[1:16:09] going to do it today, but I'm out of
[1:16:10] time. I'm looking forward to getting
[1:16:12] into this golden rule about do unto
[1:16:15] others as you would have them do unto
[1:16:17] you.
[1:16:18] And friends, it's super important. It's
[1:16:23] not just something that we say. This is
[1:16:26] something that has very, very great
[1:16:30] blessings
[1:16:32] and great consequences,
[1:16:35] more than you might imagine, how great
[1:16:38] this golden rule is. It's so next week,
[1:16:41] please, please come. As I said, I I was
[1:16:44] was gonna had my notes to work on it
[1:16:46] today, but we will um we'll put it off
[1:16:49] so we have enough time. The musicians
[1:16:52] can come.
[1:16:53] I opened up the door for baptisms.
[1:16:58] Do we have any baptisms this morning?
[1:17:02] Yes.
[1:17:05] Yes. Any more? We have We have one. Do
[1:17:07] we have more baptisms? Do we have just
[1:17:09] one?
[1:17:12] One of the things
[1:17:14] that Jesus told us to do is he said ma
[1:17:18] make disciples
[1:17:20] of all nations. Disciples of what?
[1:17:23] Disciples of Christ.
[1:17:25] And he said baptize them.
[1:17:28] Then Peter
[1:17:30] after the Holy Spirit have have fallen
[1:17:32] Peter then they say we want this same
[1:17:37] blessing that that you have. We want to
[1:17:39] we want to have the same joy that you
[1:17:41] have. They were cut in their hearts. And
[1:17:43] then they said, "How do we receive what
[1:17:46] you disciples have?" You have the same
[1:17:48] thing that Jesus says. "How do we
[1:17:49] receive it?" Peter said, "Repent,
[1:17:53] go back from your sins
[1:17:56] and then be baptized in the name of
[1:17:57] Jesus Christ for the remission, for the
[1:18:00] taking away of your sins." And then
[1:18:04] don't forget the promise that's
[1:18:05] associated with baptism.
[1:18:08] We talk about I talked about God's
[1:18:10] promises that are associated with
[1:18:11] prayer. There is a promise associated
[1:18:14] with just going into the water and
[1:18:17] confessing before the public that I am a
[1:18:21] different person. I'm a Christian. That
[1:18:24] promise is to have the same spirit that
[1:18:28] walked the earth 2,000 years ago. The
[1:18:31] same spirit that gave sight to the
[1:18:33] blind. That same spirit that raised the
[1:18:35] dead. The same spirit that gave
[1:18:37] salvation to to all those that were
[1:18:39] seeking that turned a prostitute in into
[1:18:42] a saint that that could turn a mentally
[1:18:44] ill woman into someone that that is
[1:18:47] completely normal and serving God could
[1:18:49] take a epileps epileptic child and and
[1:18:52] cast the demon out of him and make him
[1:18:54] normal. That same spirit is promised to
[1:18:58] us if we are baptized and take on the
[1:19:01] name of Jesus Christ.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:04] And it said, "For this promise is unto
[1:19:06] you and to your children and to them
[1:19:07] that are far off, even as many as the
[1:19:09] Lord our Gods are called." And we have a
[1:19:11] sister that's
[1:19:13] coming up and and
[1:19:17] I've seen her. Sister Mercy, I think
[1:19:18] you're the one. Where is Sister Mercy?
[1:19:21] Somewhere. Brother David. There's
[1:19:22] Brother David. Um witnessed to her at
[1:19:26] work and she started coming. I don't
[1:19:28] know six, eight months ago.
[1:19:31] The Lord was working on her and working
[1:19:33] on her and working on her. The Lord's
[1:19:35] done really mighty things in her life.
[1:19:39] And now she's going to take that next
[1:19:42] step,
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; which is to come before us,
[1:19:46] give her heart to Jesus Christ, confess,
[1:19:49] I am a Christian.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; And when you do that, friends,
[1:19:54] this the bar is raised in your life.
[1:19:58] You're being baptized and now you're
[1:20:00] saying, "I'm a Christian. I'm taking on
[1:20:01] the name of Christ. Now you have to live
[1:20:03] right.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Put away those sins. Understand
[1:20:09] that your sins are wiped away by the
[1:20:12] blood of the lamb, which is what baptism
[1:20:15] is symbolic of,
[1:20:18] but you come up symbolically as a new
[1:20:20] person.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; And when she when she comes up and when
[1:20:25] when we
[1:20:27] um when we baptize
[1:20:31] This is a different This is going to be
[1:20:33] a different person. It's symbolic. So,
[1:20:36] you're going to have to make an effort.
[1:20:37] I mean, I'm looking at my friend here
[1:20:41] that was baptized.
[1:20:43] I was baptizing up here and and uh
[1:20:49] this good-looking bald guy comes up
[1:20:52] and he says, "Pastor, I want to be
[1:20:53] baptized."
[1:20:56] Hadn't really met you.
[1:20:58] We get up there and didn't I didn't
[1:21:00] really feel anything. Baptize you in the
[1:21:03] name of the Lord.
[1:21:05] And then I get a message a week later
[1:21:09] and he says, "Pastor, I my dad forced me
[1:21:14] to to smoke pot when I was seven years
[1:21:16] old."
[1:21:18] And he says, "From that time, I have
[1:21:20] been doing drugs and and and in these
[1:21:23] drugs." And he says, "I I never miss."
[1:21:25] And he says, "Now it's been seven days
[1:21:28] since you baptized me that I have had no
[1:21:31] drugs in my system."
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; And the same God that can do it for
[1:21:46] Manny is the same God that can do it for
[1:21:48] me or you or your family or anyone else.
[1:21:51] You just pray and you lay it at the feet
[1:21:53] of God. And you say, "Lord, it's a
[1:21:55] promise. Here it is. Here's my children.
[1:21:58] Now you take it because it's better in
[1:21:59] your hands than it is my hands."
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; And you know what? He'll do it.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he promised.
[1:22:17] I hear the Savior say,
[1:22:22] "Thy strength
[1:22:25] indeed is small.
[1:22:28] Child of weakness,
[1:22:31] watch and pray.
[1:22:34] Find me
[1:22:37] thine all
[1:22:41] Jesus
[1:22:43] paid it all.
[1:22:47] All to him.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Sin had left a crimson stain. He washed
[1:23:00] it white as snow.
[1:23:04] For now
[1:23:06] indeed I find
[1:23:10] thy power
[1:23:12] and thine alone
[1:23:15] can change the leopard spots
[1:23:21] and melt the heart.
[1:23:27] Jesus
[1:23:29] paid it all.
[1:23:33] All to him I
[1:23:38] sin
[1:23:39] had left a crimson stain.
[1:23:44] He washed
[1:23:46] it white as snow.
[1:23:50] And when
[1:23:52] before the throne
[1:23:56] I stand
[1:23:59] complete.
[1:24:01] Jesus died my soul to save.
[1:24:07] My lips shall soon redeem.
[1:24:14] Jesus
[1:24:15] paid it all.
[1:24:19] All to him I know.
[1:24:25] Sin
[1:24:26] hasn't stained me.
[1:24:30] Wash it white.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; And Jesus
[1:24:38] paid it all.
[1:24:42] All to him.
[1:24:47] Sin had left the crimson st.
[1:25:01] You were the word at the beginning,
[1:25:08] one with God the Lord most high.
[1:25:18] Your hidden glory in creation
[1:25:24] now revealed in you our Christ.
[1:25:31] What a beautiful name it is.
[1:25:35] What a beautiful name it is.
[1:25:39] The name of Jesus
[1:25:43] Christ my king.
[1:25:47] What a beautiful name it is.
[1:25:51] Nothing compares to this.
[1:25:54] What a beautiful name it is. The name of
[1:26:00] Jesus.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; You didn't want heaven without.
[1:26:11] So Jesus, you brought heaven
[1:26:16] down.
[1:26:21] My sin was great. Your love was greater.
[1:26:27] What could seeparate
[1:26:31] us now? What a wonderful name it is.
[1:26:36] What a wonderful name it is.
[1:26:40] The name of Jesus
[1:26:44] Christ my king.
[1:26:48] What a wonderful name it is.
[1:26:52] Nothing compares to this.
[1:26:55] What a wonderful name it is. The name of
[1:27:01] Jesus.
[1:27:05] And death could not hold you. The veil
[1:27:09] tore before you. You silence the boast
[1:27:15] of sin and
[1:27:20] the heavens are roaring.
[1:27:23] The praise of your glory.
[1:27:41] One more song.
[1:27:45] You have no rival
[1:27:48] and you have no equal
[1:27:52] now and forever.
[1:27:55] God you reign.
[1:27:59] And yours is the kingom.
[1:28:03] And yours is the glory.
[1:28:07] And yours is the name
[1:28:10] above all.

[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Do you have anything to say about this
[1:30:10] baptism?
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; No, I trust him. You know, since the
[1:30:16] beginning I I told him,
[1:30:20] show me. I said, give me a sign. And he
[1:30:24] did. And he told me, "Your tears were
[1:30:28] dry. Your heart will heal and your
[1:30:30] season will change. So he did all of
[1:30:33] that.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Your tears will dry.

[1:38:32] of Jesus Christ and to spread the gospel
[1:38:35] of the Lord. But friends, it's also a
[1:38:39] decision for us
[1:38:41] that we look at this sister,
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; we help her,
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; we pray for her, and we are there for
