TRANSCRIPT
========================================
leading us along and you you encourage yourself that way you strengthen yourself that way you know the first time you do something and it didn't come out quite quite as well as maybe you saw the picture of um you take a look and said i want to recreate that but you know the second well i the second time you do it and for us it's two three four five times maybe for god it's the first time always but watch he says in the message proving his word he says god is his own interpreter do you know if we have those there when he promised he said let there be light and there was light and he said a virgin shall conceive and she did see whatever god says god proves it no matter how much you try to think the physical resurrection couldn't be and then people is back yonder just dust of the earth and past dust now they're just into acids and gases and their body was that their body was made of their soul is still living god said all raise it up job said though the skin worms destroys this body yet in my flesh i'll see god see no matter every word has got to be kept and man shall live by that word if god's word ever failed you you would lose your confidence but because it doesn't fail you can go back to it time and time and time again jehovah jireh he says don't look at yourself look at your lamb he says god don't accept you he accepted the lamb and the lamb took your place oh god can't you see it not you you're not worthy i'm not worthy there's none of us worthy but see is he worthy god said so he accepted him he said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased this is my son hear ye him on the day of the adoption this is him don't say well the doctor says i'll never get well that's what the doctor says now that man is a scientific man he looks he looks the way nature is running and he sees you can never be well that scientifically shows him about that well that's what he's looking at if you look at the same thing then you'll never be well but don't look at what he said don't look at what what how you're diminishing but look at your sacrifice that said and remember your abraham seed and heirs with him then if you are stay with the promise accept him as your inhaler just stay right there and then in expectations listen to this children the word of god will defeat satan anywhere any place on any condition any time any condition anywhere you might find yourself in your place where you think god won't listen to you god look where i'm at right now look where i've gotten myself you can't hear but the word of god tells us he will hear you he didn't say until you get to church and kneel down at the altar he says when you'll turn your heart back towards him he says when jesus was here he was god and god was in christ reconciling the world to himself but he never used any of his gifts when he met satan he brought the kingdom of god so low till the weakest of chris christians can use it when satan come to him and said if thou be the son of god command these stones he said it is written the word he took him up and tried to whitewash your word for him and jesus said it is also written he took him up to the top of the mountain and said he had to look at all the kingdoms i will give them to you if you'll worship me jesus said it is written there it is and it is risen whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe you receive it and you shall have it then defeat defeat satan with the word of god you know they're easy to read these words and get inspired but how about putting him into action you know one more here the word became flesh from the india trip report he says now of the same spirit that said let there be light and there was light that said let there be trees and there was trees and if that same mine that was in christ being you how much could it say let there be no cancer and it would be gone let the blind eyes be opened and it would be so see it's your thought jesus it verily said you you said that was jesus but wait a minute he said have faith in god for verily verily i say unto you if ye shall say to this mountain be moved plucked up and cast into the sea and don't doubt in your heart but believe that which you say will come to pass you will have whatever things thou sayst is that right you shall have it not me you shall have it it's easy to put it on somebody else it's easy to put it on the minister it's easy to put it on the prophet it's easy to put it on this preacher or pastor but you need it you need it when you're by yourself you need it when you're facing the things out there where you're at and he's a christ jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever what power has been given to the church now you can express it by mental conception but if it becomes a real revelation of god that you see be see it before it happen and express it in word form that word takes a whole and becomes a material a thought expressed oh my how god see it your heart your mind is so and filled with god's spirit until your thoughts become his thoughts amen there you are when your mind and your leading and your guiding becomes a direct place or a direct inspiration of the holy spirit that's moving through your mortal being when you're looking at the situation and your words want to say i can't but that one inside you says get up and go stand up take god at his word and move forward and this body begins to be subject to that and watch god move and then you hear that's my daughter that's my son hear ye them he's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and how is he manifesting himself through his body through his bride so again in exodus he says i am that i am now let's just look at a couple of the promises or the things that god told the old testament saints them you know we're the the spiritual seed of abraham so the promises he gave to them are ours also okay so genesis we're going to read some out of genesis here the seed chapter let's see book chapter 9 and we'll verses read verses 12 to 17. and god said this is a token of the covenant which i made between me and you and every living creature that is with you for perpetual generations i do set my bone in in the wreck in the cloud and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth and it shall come to pass when i bring a cloud over the earth and that bow shall be seen in the clouds and i will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh and the water shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh and the bow will be in the cloud and i will look upon it that i may remember the everlasting covenant between god and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth and god said unto noah this is the token of the covenant which i have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth how many has ever seen a rainbow how many does that remind him of jim that's god's promise and he's faithful to his word it's a natural thing that he put up there he said you look at that and i remind yourself that i will keep my word i will keep my promise oh but that was for noah no he said to all that includes me that includes you genesis 17 19 and god said sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shall call his name isaac and i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seed after him now if you've heard the news recently isaac seed is still there they're still a country they're still a people and god is still with them i i saw something in the news the other day that some of the uh in the the seven or eight days of the the bombing and all they were talking the uh on the uh hamas and them they were mentioning that obviously they got somebody on their side because over over these these years we were they've said even it seems like that the bombs will be coming and they'll turn down the street and then they'll turn down the street and they'll go right to the building where they're supposed to hit like somebody's driving them well let me tell you there is somebody driving them he watches over his children and he keeps his word because if he doesn't keep his word then we're all in trouble but he says i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with the seed after him genesis 32 sorry genesis 32 24-29 and jacob was left alone and there was a and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day breaketh and he said i will not let thee go except thou bless me if jacob could do that so can you if god comes and you say i am not going to until you bless me i will not back off i will not just say okay lord i'm going to stay here until and he said unto him what is thy name and he said jacob and he said thy name shall be called no more jacob but israel. for as a prince has thou power with god and with men and hast prevailed and jacob asked him and said tell me i pray thee thy name and he said where is it that thou thus aster my name and he blessed them there he says that the prince of god thou has prevailed remember when daniel was seeking god he's reading in here and he says i see where jeremiah said 70 years and he begins to seek god and of daniel and i know daniel was human and he began to wonder after the second and third day that there seemed to be no answer until the angel of the lord comes by and says i came down but i was withheld i i was with steward withstood by satan and his angels but god had already sent an answer god has an answer for you god has heard your requests god has already made provision but he knows the perfect timing for it all we uh we've learned that as as as parents or now as grandparents at the timing of things in in the um in the raising of the character of children of ourselves learning to wait learning to be patient not getting everything you want just because you want it when you want it but god knows best for us and they that wade upon the lord shall renew their strength because when you get it when when you get what you want when you want it you really never develops a good character you become spoiled you become um oh god i was gonna say spoiled brat but that's me all right okay just understand the character and the nature of god it takes time it's a molding it's a shaping you know it's i remember brother ed sending us a um a video that he had seen about a a man that that works with clay and um and he's shaping and he's molding and he's working with that clay as he's talking he's demonstrating it and he purposely takes some of the clay and he lets it off to the side quite un unfinished or you just think it isn't and he works on another piece and he goes and the four or five pieces that he sets down seem to dry up and they're somewhat disfigured they're not the best looking pieces of pottery there or whatever he was shaping and and the place is full it's it's it's a uh like a a classroom that he's doing and he's just not paying attention to it and then he stops and he goes now those pieces there that look unfinished he picks one up and he puts it back on the the potter's table there and he begins to get a little moisture work back into it and he begins to reshape it and he begins to work it again and he turns and he shows now what he intended with it and i'm glad god does the same thing with us sometimes it seems lord i i don't seem to be where i should be but god's not finished with me yet and as we go to genesis 35 and another another part that he deals with jacob 9-13 and god appeared unto jacob again and he came out of when he came out of pen pat anaram and blessed him and god said unto him thy name is jacob thy name shall not be called jacob anymore but israel shall be thy name and he called his name israel now let's go on to the next and god said unto him i am god almighty be fruitful and multiply a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee and king shall come out of thy loins and the land which i gave abraham and isaac to thee will i give it and to thy seed after thee will i give the land and verse 13 give therefore so maybe i jump one one too many and god went up from him in that place where he talked with him he said to you i will give this because i've already made that promise but in giving that promise and meeting with jacob he changes his nature he changes his character his way of being the old man begins to fade away and the new man begins to be expressed the one who is now growing in christ the one who is now experiencing god and is beginning to grow and you're beginning to see a christ-like nature in that person and how is that expressed with the big halo on their head in the way they dress yes that's part of it but really the character is the actions taken that's what is heard most that's what is read most uh the reaction to an action disappointing news how do they react to disappointing news how do they react when god says no to them how do they react when it seems like the brother the sister is preferred what is the nature and their character of them god bless my brother god bless my sister i'm glad god is using them what a blessing for them or do they still go back and sit i'm better than them i prayed more no the nature has began to change jacob is israel he's no longer a cheat he's no longer a supplanter he's now a prince with god changing my heart oh god continue to work that nature with me this is the things that god said and we still see them today and they not failed i really like this one and makes it sound like i didn't like the other ones but no i like them all first kings chapter 3 verse read verses 9 to 12. this is speaking of solomon god had given prop made david a promise he says they'll always be through the line of david there'll always be a king in your line and here's solomon solomon is now raised up and god has told solomon you can have anything you want it's yours and here's solomon as he looks over the people of israel and this is what he tells the lord give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people that i may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this thy so great a people i like the way he addresses it give thy servant because that's who i am i'm your servant you're not a servant to me god i'm a servant to you he says give me an understanding to judge thy people these are the children of god he says that i may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this thy again so greater people they're yours god and the speech praised the lord that solomon had asked these things it pleased god to see that solomon would say lord i'm go you said ask therefore i'm going to ask you you said to speak therefore i'm going to speak let's finish that up it was just a 12. all right and god said to him because thou has asked this thing and has not asked for thyself long life neither has asked riches for thyself nor has asked the ask the life of thine enemies but has asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment behold i have done according to thy words again i have done according to thy words lo i have given thee a wise and understanding heart so that there is none like thee before thee neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee you get to a place as a christian as the bride of christ that your nature and your character has been changed god is not afraid of what you're going to ask and say because you're going to be like solomon you're going to say give me an understanding heart give me a spirit that is mellow that is sweet that is humble give me an attitude in a way that i'm going to love my brethren i'm going to love the sisters and i'm going to care for the lost one and it's okay what happens i don't have to have the new car i don't have to have the nice in place as long as i have you lord this world is not my home i'm just a passing through my treasures are laid up somewhere on the other side now we go we'll take let's look at some of the things that jesus said i i thought this interesting in saint john chapter 8 verse 58. i'm just taking you know the story that goes with these you know that what was it there but jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you before abraham was i am he's still the i am he didn't say that was the character of back then he said it hasn't changed i still i am i'm a very present help in the time of trouble i am the one that supplies every one of your needs the i am is there a self-existing one mark 9 verse 23 jesus said unto him if thou can't believe all things are possible to him that believeth that's god's word all jesus was ever going to say with what the scripture ever said he was going to do and say it wasn't going to change all things are possible to him that believeth saint john 6 35 and jesus said unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst that's not talking about a physical hunger and hunger and physical thirst it's talking about the satisfying portion for the inner man that job said though god slay me yet i'll trust them the three hebrew boys would say will not bow down to that image of daniel our brother will only bow to god no matter they weren't worried about the flesh saint john 11 23 to 27 jesus said go on they had told them lazarus your friend is sick and jesus was too busy with other things that didn't bother him didn't care it seemed like your friend jesus peter might have tapped did you hear that jesus lazarus is sick jesus said it's okay it's okay and you know sometimes it might seem like that's he's doing that with you that it's okay it's all right just just hold on a little bit because he knows what's coming up he knows what's going to happen so he says so we know that he goes and and and martha and mary are there and they come out and they said had you been here our brother would not have died you know you would have healed him we've seen you do it over and over there's no question about it but then jesus says it unto her saith unto her thy brother shall rise again and martha said unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection of the last day and jesus is standing right for him says i am the resurrection i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live the woman at the well she hears something jesus says and he said hey we've been told that when the messiah comes he'll do these things and he goes yeah you're right when he comes and he walks away no he says i'm he i am he identifies himself the same every time when you're sick in your trouble and you say i've been told you're a healer he says i am without fail it's who i am i'm a very present time in the help of trouble in the very present help in the time of trouble i'll get it right she says and what's whosoever liveth and believeth me shall never die and he asked her do you believe this she has to answer she saith unto him yea lord i believe that thou art the christ the son of god which should come into the world and because i believe that i can take every promise that is written about you and stand on it every promise that god has said he'll keep it and you can stand on it now we'll get to to another part it's still jesus saying but he's telling you to speak for you to say matthew 5 18. for he says first for verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass not one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled every promise everything said every scripture written through every prophet through every everything that david said in the psalms through all that jeremiah and isaiah said everything will come to pass without fail then again he says in matthew 6 25 and 26. therefore i say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body what you shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body more than raiment he says behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather in two barns yet your heavenly father feedeth them are ye not much better than they in other words he says i value you more than that there is more value in you than that yet i take care of them okay so again he's speaking some words and you got you've got to catch him you gotta you gotta be able to put your name in there when everything seems to be going upside down he said wait a minute god you said you valued me more than that i i saw something the other day somebody posted and they were talking about god and and sometimes some people just have a way put things in words and it comes out means so much to you you you i sit down there with a pen and a paper and an hour later i have got two lines maybe and other people sit down and an hour later they got a book it's just they're able to express it and they're talking about god he said one is saying god seemed to be so indifferent it seemed to be so this and the other one says i can take the same god you're looking and i can make him love me look and see that he loves me how are you hearing what he's saying how are you interpreting the words coming to you it seems like he didn't care when he did this with the three hebrew children but he was about to come and manifest himself to them he was like come on come on be there with him in the fire remember he's the same yesterday today and forever matthew 18 verses 18 to 20. i'm sorry brother peter but i forgot to include a scripture from peter i got matthew and john and luke most of the mcfaddens have been included in this scripture reading here verily i say unto you whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever he shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven again i say unto you if two that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them where two or three that means you and your wife and your son you and your wife and your daughter or if you happen to be by yourself you yourself and what would be the third one you in the lord you're never alone it's so easy to give that to somebody else well they deserve it they're good people no it's you put your name in there he says where two or three are gathered there i am in the midst of them this is god's word so what is the reason god's word is given to us so we can just read it in a book no so we can put it to work because he wants his children to you know it it's it's amazing i i watch asher he's three years old my grandson and abby will send us pictures amos will be under the truck working on his truck and asher is laying back with him upside down under the truck i'm helping papa he got a tool bag a plastic tool bag for christmas we got two of them one from each side both sides of the family he come over to the house and we were having trouble with the ceiling fan uh because we just put a new one on and wasn't working and he looks at me goes papa if i had my tools i could fix that in his mind he's just like his dad i got a tool bag i'm under the truck i can do it so abby told me while they were visiting the garcias he was walking around with the tool bag they gave him and he looks up at the pitch of the roof and he goes mama give me a ladder because i see something wrong i can fix that oh that i would have the same faith and come to god as a child and not get it in here first and start thinking i can't i can't it takes a minister it takes a prey to brother it takes a better christian than me now it's you and god he's more than able luke 11 9-10 i did we finished the scripture before that all right let's go to luke and i say unto you ask i think ask involves speaking and it shall be given to you seek invi involves a little bit of opening the doors opening the book opening the shutters little bit of of you put yourself a knocking and it shall be opened unto you for everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him and knocketh it shall be opened well lord i sat in my rocking chair for six months and you never answered me he says well i was waiting to hear i was waiting to hear jesus but you never spoke it either luke 23 verses 42 and 43 this one when brother john andes was here and he i believe his brother john has spoke of this it just had never clicked to me that way when he said he sent it jesus lord remember me and he said he didn't think he didn't write he spoke and he said unto jesus lord remember me when thou cometh into thy kingdom and jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee today thou shalt be with me in paradise i had never put the part that today thou shalt be in paradise because when jesus got down there he would be there too it was just kind of a saying to me but it was god keeping his word god had already seen him down there but he had to speak he had to say something and god was waiting for that maybe that's what he was waiting for so he could say okay it is finished okay the last one has come in god is waiting and wanting to hear from you saint john 14 12 through 14 verily verily for sure truly truly i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than thee shall he do because i go unto my father and again whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son if you ask shall ask anything in my name i will do it do you realize what asking does what it shows shows faith and without faith it's impossible to please god and i know paul says it this way think on these things if there be any virtue if there be any praise you know what is better to have those thoughts in your mind but those thoughts also need to become words they need to be put into action it needs to get out and reach god's heart god's ears and watch him go to work those three boys had to say come to that place and say we will not we've heard what you said king and we're not disrespecting you we just serve a greater king we just have one that's dear to us and they put those words into action god said that's what i've been waiting for because you're about to get a visitation that you've never had before you're about to see this god that you've served all your life that you've done you're about to meet him did not brother branham say the angel of the lord came into his room he allowed brother billy paul he's jesus christ the same yesterday he still does those things i remember the testimony of our brother john rojas family friends and and and a good family friend knew him back in california pentecostal church he worked for my father in construction and they accepted the message they were in sierra vista and he he got sick with cancer and he was quite sick and he was down to his last couple weeks of life and him and his wife were were in the in in the room and and and they both testified the angel of the lord came into the room and says well done thy good and faithful sermon you'll be home with me sooner he's the same yesterday today and forever you know you say but oh no that came yes he still does those things well he does them over there another no you have got to confess with your mouth and believe with your heart and god will get to work in here verily very listen to he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because i go unto my father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name i will do it matthew 17 20 and jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verily i say unto you if you have the faith as a grain of mustard seed you shall say unto this mountain that's not you'll think about it you'll hope about it but you'll speak to the situation remove hence to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you for with god all things are possible but he's telling nothing will be impossible unto you if you can take god at his word and apply it and you know what pleases god most when he sees the son and daughter of god doing those things when he sees him like i said watching watching um asher there doing things that a young boy would do he's copying his father and the blessing of that is seeing his father being a christian because if he wasn't a christian he might be doing things we wouldn't want him to be doing but to see him doing those things that's why it's important to live a christian life and be a very good example be christ expressed and fresh on this earth again for someone to desire i want to be like that speaking a brother called me the other day and we got to talk in a little bit and he said he mentioned his his nephew he says you'll never know the effect you had on him for the time he was here how you treated him on i said no i probably never will he said but you did he still talks about it and that is a lived life a sermon you know not because i preached or not because i did because something reached out and touched somebody and i live life romans 14 11 11-12 for it is written as i live saith the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to god so then every one of us shall give an account of himself to god paul puts it there you've got a confession a confession comes from the words we speak it says every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that jesus christ is lord you're going to do it willingly with all your heart or you're going to be forced to there'll come a time in everyone's life that they'll have to say yeah that was god i want to confess that now he's my lord there is no other he says and you'll have to give an account you know i want my account to show that it was covered by the blood i want my account to say that his heart was pure like he talked about um solomon and because you had the right attitude and the right heart the right desires it can be done it can be said of you it's not just for the minister it's just not for that saintly sister it's for every one of us romans 10 verses 8 to 10 but what saith it what saith the word of god the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thine heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shall believe in thine heart that god has raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved if you can't believe that he was raised from the dead then you're in trouble because you then you can't have faith that you'll be raised from the dead and be like job though the skin worms eat this body though they bury me yet i know these eyes shall see my redeemer these eyes he said he knew that there was a promise there and for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation yea lord i believe sometimes it's helped out my unbelief but that's a conflict you're still asking god to do what his word says now we have luke 12 and 8. i know most of these scriptures are you've heard a thousand times or better but it's still the living word of god and i say unto you whosoever shall confess me before man him shall the son of man also confess before the angels of god i love that dream that that brother brahm talked about of the man that got up before heaven and asked if his name was there and the angels look and says i can't find your name well what do i do now says you'll have to go before the throne there and plead your case and he begins to realize that he has no chance whatsoever that light begins to penetrate through every thought through every attitude through every notion you had and begins to show it unless it's been covered by the blood then it can't be revealed no more it doesn't exist but he said i heard the sweetest sound the sweetest voice came up behind me and said father on earth he stood for me therefore i'll stand for him today you know brother brandon when he walked into that little restaurant and he walked in and he had seen all that ungodliness going on that old the policeman and it just it just made him upset and he goes outside and he begins to say god how can you stand all this filth how can you you should just destroy them all and god has to give him a vision about his sins hitting god and that banner of blood there and then watch the change in brother braham's attitude so quick then i'll go back and all give to them that same opportunity that i have he says john first john 4 15 whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god god dwelleth in him and he and god it's not just verbal words you say but it has to be a life it has to be something inside of you coming out that way and then david we know david mann after god's own heart but the bible it's written david's life has shown very well his failures his mistakes him being human him being weak but it also shows the revelation of god in david's heart to be able to express to words that you and i are going to need psalms 32 we'll read verses 1 through 5. blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven whose sin is covered blessed is the man unto whom the lord imputeth not iniquity and in whose spirit there is no guile let's continue when i kept silence my bones waxed old through my roaring or through my groaning through my anguish all the day long when i've when i've tried to hide them when i've not repented of them when i've not admitted them to god when i've not put them under the blood then my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long when i was too embarrassed too ashamed of my actions that i wouldn't even confess them when the quickest way is to say i was wrong forgive me cover me by your blood and then the peace of god comes with that for day and night thy hand was heavy upon me you just can't rest you just can't hide you just can't get away until that is made right he says my moisture is turned into the drought of summer is i couldn't even cry anymore i felt dry i felt dead he said but then i acknowledge my sin unto thee and my iniquity have i not hid i said i will confess my transgressions unto the lord and thou forgave us the iniquity of my sin until david began to say i and he confessed it with his own mouth not a blaming not an excuse but saying i was wrong i made a mistake i messed up and maybe again and god said and then david says in verse 7 thou art my hiding place thou shalt preserve me from trouble thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance your heart begins to sing again your heart begins to worship the lord songs of deliverance oh yes jesus loves me oh how much he cares and you begin to feel that relief that lifting up and we'll finish it with the last verse first john 1 6 through 9. sometimes this seems a little contrary then in in one way just a christian does not sin john is telling and then he says this if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin david said blessed is a man who god does not impute iniquity he didn't say blessed is the man who walks perfect who never fails he said blessed is the man who god does not hold it against him and john is saying if we walk in the light what is the light the word of god what does the word god tell you make it right confess it say i'm sorry put it under the blood if you walk under the light not of confessing it to a man not of doing penance not of providing your own sacrifice but doing what god said he says we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if i look at myself as a human in flesh i realize there's nothing good about me but if i confess what god says and stand on that then god looks at me through the shed blood he's been accepted in my stead he's been accepted in your place if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness sometimes when you're frustrated and you're upset and you're troubled because it seems like god doesn't hear just take a look take a close examination what is between me and god what's causing that it's not god's fault god keeps his word god never fails he's a great help he's a great deliverance he he's not only that but he's not caught unawares it's not like he has to come up with a new solution and says hang on a bit i need to go back into the lab and and try this and see if this works no he's already provided he's just waiting for you to say okay lord be it unto me according to thy word and your word says if i confess if i confess you to be lord if i convey every part of this that if i confess god keeps his word and never fails if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness o to be clean and pure before god to hear well done thou good and faithful servant i think we're all waiting for that we're all warning to that we're all desiring that to hear him say this is my beloved son this is my beloved daughter i'm not ashamed to call them my own this is my bride let's bow our hands the musicians will come lord your word is true it's unfailing it's eternal you are faithful lord and you are just in what you do hear the words of brother branham when he said if i came to that that day and he said depart from me william branham and you're going to hell brother brahm said i love him too much to argue with him lord may our hearts be at a
