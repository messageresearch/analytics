[25:54] backward all is well
[25:56] there's something that settles down in
[25:58] your heart says it's okay
[26:12] [Music]
[26:22] [Music]
[26:25] oh there is a place
[26:39] [Music]
[26:50] is
[26:52] [Music]
[26:54] [Applause]
[26:59] [Music]
[27:04] is
[27:06] the lord
[27:29] as they play that why don't you just
[27:31] thank your worship
[27:36] [Music]
[27:56] oh there is a place
[28:03] behind this
[28:19] if it's not well with you right now ask
[28:22] them to make it well to give you that
[28:23] assurance in your life
[28:25] that all is well amen i'm going to read
[28:28] you something here
[28:30] that i read last night
[28:33] and it's it's a little bit funny but it
[28:35] really drives the point
[28:36] it it reminds told me all is well
[28:39] on a sunday morning and it it is a
[28:42] listed as a southern church
[28:44] and you'll understand why here the new
[28:46] pastor called them one of the elder
[28:48] deacons to open the service in prayer
[28:51] the elder deacon stood up about his head
[28:52] and said lord
[28:55] i don't like buttermilk asked the pastor
[28:58] opened one eye and wondered
[29:00] where this was going the deacon
[29:02] continues the lord
[29:03] and i don't like lord either
[29:06] now the pastor was a little perplexed
[29:08] the deacon continued lord i don't care
[29:10] much for
[29:10] plain flour either but after you mix
[29:14] them all up and bake them in a hot oven
[29:15] i sure love them biscuits
[29:20] yeah and this was in lord help us to
[29:22] realize that when life gets hard
[29:25] things come up that we don't like or
[29:27] whenever we don't understand what you
[29:29] are doing
[29:30] that we need to wait and see what you
[29:32] are making
[29:34] after you get through mixing and baking
[29:36] i am sure it will be
[29:37] something a whole lot better than
[29:38] biscuits
[29:40] that spoke to me last night in this
[29:42] situation in new orleans
[29:44] it was a light way to put it but lord
[29:46] let me just rest in you
[29:48] because what you're doing and what
[29:49] you're working the end result
[29:51] is exactly what you planned and promised
[29:54] and said you would do
[29:55] so again all is well we have heard the
[29:58] message shalom
[30:12] we have heard the message
[30:22] [Music]
[30:30] [Music]
[30:36] [Music]
[30:44] [Music]
[30:47] this is what happens when you come
[30:48] running in at the last moment i left
[30:50] something else on the desk over there
[30:53] brother ed i left the prayer request
[30:54] sitting on there too
[30:56] we sat there and you know your first
[31:00] reaction is oh no i'm going to be late
[31:02] oh no i'm going to be delayed there's an
[31:04] accident or whatever
[31:06] then you get to the scene of the acts
[31:07] and you go oh lord have mercy on them
[31:10] when you see the situation the truck was
[31:14] was literally destroyed and the car was
[31:17] in bad
[31:18] shape and the ambulances had left
[31:20] already with the folks in them i'm sure
[31:22] and
[31:24] but you just you have to stop and say
[31:26] lord have mercy on them
[31:28] you've been good to us but have mercy on
[31:30] them
[31:31] i did get a prayer request
[31:34] just sent to me right before i walked in
[31:38] and let me read it to you
[31:39] [Music]
[31:41] brother david williamson said a friend

[32:04] that's why we're here for someone
[32:07] it's not they're not there
[32:12] well maybe they're in my bible
[32:16] okay we should open the bible up a
[32:17] little more maybe
[32:19] i thought i had put him there but
[32:21] [Music]
[32:24] we we sometimes we forget sometimes we
[32:26] get busy sometimes we get in a hurry
[32:29] until something comes up and it catches
[32:31] our attention and we
[32:32] stop for a moment say lord lord first of
[32:35] all thank you for watching over us
[32:38] and we commit ourselves completely over
[32:40] to you so
[32:42] sister amelia says please pray for me
[32:49] i started having dizziness and i almost
[32:51] fell at
[32:52] the a couple of times so
[32:56] remember our sister amelia there so
[32:59] brother robert circonas sees

[33:04] appointment with the clinic i just pray
[33:06] that
[33:07] all will go well for me he says thank
[33:09] you
[33:10] for praying for me amen 8 o'clock on
[33:13] thursday
[33:15] so we'll do that
[33:19] [Music]
[33:20] brother ed dougla mentioned to me that
[33:22] tuesday
[33:24] they're going to be out of town working
[33:26] they're going to be rotating in and out
[33:28] of town but going out to bullhead city
[33:29] area
[33:31] for approximately two months so they'll
[33:32] be driving and working and
[33:35] i told him he's going to have to come
[33:36] back to tucson to cool off a little bit
[33:38] because it's really hot in bullhead city
[33:42] and then those of you that have heard
[33:45] or maybe saw on the prayer request for
[33:47] sister adriana murray
[33:49] she has found positive with the covid
[33:52] and
[33:53] so let's remember all the family and the
[33:55] children brother paul
[33:57] those that around and you know there's
[33:59] nothing too hard for the lord
[34:02] my father was telling me there's a
[34:05] brother that
[34:06] down in embodiment which is close to
[34:08] wymas mexico and
[34:11] good friends of my dad and they live up
[34:14] in phoenix now but
[34:15] his son had crossed back into mexico and
[34:18] was not allowed to return and now
[34:20] he has covered and also
[34:24] his mother works in his school dad
[34:27] worked for the
[34:28] for the train company and i believe it
[34:31] there he said the two of the brothers
[34:32] were doctors
[34:34] and he reported to him that every single
[34:36] day their report
[34:37] reporting or telling them two more
[34:39] people we know
[34:40] passed away with code and so it's not
[34:44] something we take lightly
[34:46] the jimenez family in in california good
[34:49] friends of ours
[34:51] the two daughters and dad have now
[34:52] passed away and they don't expect mom to
[34:55] live through and there was a
[34:57] they forwarded us a little news thing
[35:00] that one of the brothers
[35:01] went to the news and they featured the
[35:03] family
[35:04] and and you you stop and you think about
[35:06] it how could someone go through
[35:08] something like this
[35:09] but when there's an assurance in your
[35:11] heart and a peace
[35:13] then there's a way to get through it so
[35:15] let's stand
[35:18] [Music]
[35:20] we every day that we're out every day
[35:23] that wherever we are
[35:24] there is danger around us but he said he
[35:27] would hedge us
[35:28] he said he would he would keep us so
[35:30] that's our confidence i know
[35:32] my wife goes back to work starting
[35:34] tomorrow they're still unsure
[35:36] of how it's going to go she may be able
[35:38] to work out of the house and that's
[35:40] what we're asking the lord that she
[35:41] could stay home and just answer phone
[35:43] calls and things like that
[35:45] but there is no fear in perfect love
[35:50] and the god of perfect love lives in you
[35:51] when he lives in me how many believes
[35:53] that
[35:54] how many how many claims that saying yes

[52:03] children are facing are very different
[52:05] than than what you faced as a teenager
[52:07] than what i faced as a teenager
[52:09] especially some of them we live in the
[52:11] information age it's the
[52:12] dawning of the internet amen where
[52:14] everybody just takes google as the
[52:16] gospel truth and whatever they google
[52:18] they go with and if they don't believe
[52:20] that then they believe a college
[52:21] professor
[52:22] amen and so uh i i just wanted to say
[52:25] that i appreciated that last sunday
[52:27] night
[52:27] i'm really looking forward to the lyle
[52:29] said he's he's got something
[52:30] upon his heart and made a personal
[52:32] testimony there so
[52:34] i'm excited for that you know when i i
[52:36] begin to think it
[52:37] you know we've i i knew a couple
[52:39] brothers actually uh one very close to
[52:41] me
[52:42] in our assembly who was in college
[52:44] served the lord his whole life went off
[52:46] to college pharmaceutical
[52:47] uh degree and and just had some mix up
[52:50] with the professor and
[52:52] you know some of the things that he
[52:53] presented about the reliability of the
[52:55] bible shook the brothers faith
[52:57] and uh had it not been for god
[52:59] supernaturally getting the hold of him
[53:01] i don't know where he'd be today and i i
[53:04] thought of that as hearing by the law i
[53:05] thought you know maybe
[53:07] uh the the you know maybe in your life
[53:09] you can't relate maybe you would just
[53:10] say well
[53:11] it's never been a question for me i
[53:13] don't need to i don't need any kind of
[53:15] proof like that i don't need to look at
[53:16] egyptology well
[53:18] that may be true for you but it's not
[53:19] true for everybody god
[53:21] has brother branham said it this way he
[53:23] said god will meet you at whatever
[53:28] if you know just because your mind
[53:30] doesn't think that way doesn't mean that
[53:32] satan doesn't have a trap laid up for
[53:34] somebody somewhere
[53:36] uh and and and and the devil knows that
[53:39] brother branham said that satan studies
[53:40] you he knows your nature he knows your
[53:42] makeup he knows how you're built
[53:44] and so he knows how to attack you he
[53:46] knows your weaknesses and i begin to
[53:47] think
[53:48] you know that maybe the brother had you
[53:50] know teaching like a brother loud gave
[53:51] and you know that was specific on
[53:53] brother lyle's heart
[53:54] was for those teenage young people who
[53:56] were maybe in college especially
[53:58] you know and would face this age of
[54:01] criticism and skepticism
[54:03] amen and so i'm so glad you know we
[54:05] don't need
[54:06] if science says that god doesn't exist
[54:09] that doesn't shake my faith
[54:10] i don't need that proof but it's good to
[54:12] know amen
[54:14] as paul said we haven't believed
[54:15] cunningly devised fables
[54:18] and if you turn that up for me brother
[54:19] dick just so it turns off there just
[54:20] press up on the arrow had the ac kick on
[54:23] amen so i appreciated that a lot i'm
[54:25] looking forward to tonight i appreciate
[54:26] it brother aaron's sermon i got to
[54:28] stream it
[54:29] uh live and it just really was an
[54:31] encouragement to me
[54:32] amen and i appreciate one of the quotes
[54:34] he read about preparedness of how god is
[54:36] if god has prepared and said i go and
[54:39] prepare a place
[54:40] uh you know that where i am you may be
[54:43] also if god's prepared and put that much
[54:45] forethought into the entire world
[54:47] here before here and after then why
[54:49] should we be concerned
[54:51] amen that he doesn't take care of us on
[54:53] a day-to-day basis so
[54:54] we're thankful for that amen and and i
[54:57] uh
[54:58] i'm just full of joy this morning amen i
[55:00] trust that you came with an expectation
[55:02] uh we already had the prayer request
[55:04] read for sister adriana
[55:06] murray there who's been diagnosed with
[55:08] covet and so that was out
[55:10] on the whatsapp chat if you didn't get
[55:11] that so we're standing with our sister
[55:14] uh we we believe by faith this is no
[55:16] different than the flu then a headache
[55:18] it's a bodily sickness
[55:20] amen and god the bible says that he
[55:22] hasn't given us the spirit of
[55:23] fear but of power and of a sound mind
[55:27] i encouraged you uh through the whatsapp
[55:29] chat and i trust that you got that it
[55:31] was real
[55:32] just the lord just put it upon my heart
[55:34] you know brother branham said take your
[55:36] token
[55:36] and he said ins what is that token it's
[55:38] not a doctrine it's not the
[55:40] message it's not brother branham
[55:42] certainly not
[55:43] uh it's not a it's not an idea it's not
[55:45] a picture
[55:46] it's nothing substantive it's a person
[55:49] the token is the person of the holy
[55:50] ghost and he said take your token
[55:52] and stand upon god's word with your
[55:54] unwavering faith and then as jesus said
[55:57] ask whatsoever you will
[55:59] amen you say to this mountain be cast
[56:01] into the sea and don't doubt in your
[56:02] heart you'll have what you asked for
[56:04] and i i encourage you to say that we
[56:07] don't need to fear anything we're god's
[56:09] children we're god's family
[56:11] we've been robed by the baptism of the
[56:13] holy ghost we have full access
[56:15] to his throne that's why paul said come
[56:18] boldly
[56:19] before the before the throne of god when
[56:21] you need mercy in the time of hell
[56:23] let me say this we've been empowered and
[56:25] we are equipped to fight the devil
[56:28] god has trained us for moments like this
[56:31] this age that we're living in with all
[56:33] of the
[56:34] uncertainty in the world this is what
[56:36] god has trained us for
[56:38] now what are we going to be what are we
[56:39] proving to be
[56:41] amen so i ask you what do we need to
[56:44] fear
[56:45] as paul said whom shall i fear what
[56:47] shall i be afraid
[56:48] we have full status as the offspring of
[56:51] god
[56:52] and we have been fully authorized to use
[56:54] the name of
[56:55] jesus for any need at any time let me
[56:58] say this to you again brothers
[56:59] this is the time and the hour to believe
[57:02] not to unbelieve not to make believe but
[57:06] to believe
[57:07] and so i just wanted to to say that to
[57:09] you i'm looking forward to the service
[57:10] tonight
[57:11] and i don't mean to preach before the
[57:13] preacher but i i just have so much joy
[57:15] in my heart today
[57:16] i am thrilled to be able to introduce
[57:19] you
[57:20] uh to brother cadre diggs a personal
[57:22] very close friend of mine has been for
[57:24] many years
[57:25] and maybe you've heard his ministry i'm
[57:27] sure he's been online in many places
[57:30] preached
[57:30] all over the world the brother is a
[57:32] sought-after evangelist
[57:34] uh who's who stood the test of time his
[57:37] testimony
[57:38] he lives what he preaches and i'm a
[57:41] witness of that today
[57:42] and i and i and i say that with
[57:44] sincerity i've watched
[57:46] the spirit of god use brother diggs in
[57:49] my life my children's life my family
[57:51] life
[57:52] and in the church here in beaufort i've
[57:53] watched god supernaturally use my
[57:56] brother with a gift
[57:57] of even discernment discerning specific
[58:00] things in people's lives that no one had
[58:02] any way to know we had a brother here
[58:04] uh diagnosed with diabetes was
[58:06] full-fledged type 2
[58:08] diabetes told they told him he wouldn't
[58:10] live very much longer already had the
[58:12] symptoms started to go blind
[58:13] and and brother diggs came on a sunday
[58:15] morning not knowing
[58:16] any of the situation and started calling
[58:19] out diabetes and said i challenge you in
[58:21] the name of jesus christ to walk out of
[58:23] this building without your diabetes
[58:24] that's what he said
[58:29] they said unexplainably diabetes is gone
[58:32] his sugar
[58:33] completely reversed his vision came back
[58:35] all of his pains went away
[58:36] and today uh he's he's he's diabetes
[58:40] he's diabetes free now that's not a man
[58:43] that's not even a gift that's the holy
[58:45] spirit operating and using a gift god
[58:48] has put in this brother's life
[58:49] so we're not in the most conventional of
[58:52] circumstances here today

[1:02:41] go
[1:02:41] straight to the word let's turn to um
[1:02:43] romans the 8th
[1:02:45] chapter romans chapter 8
[1:02:50] romans chapter 8 and we're going to read
[1:02:52] a familiar verse of scripture
[1:02:55] you know something that we uh
[1:02:58] we've heard so many times but we're just
[1:03:01] praying that god
[1:03:02] would show it to you like he showed it
[1:03:03] to me romans chapter eight
[1:03:06] let's let's read um
[1:03:10] let's let's start reading that verse 26.
[1:03:16] it says likewise the spirit itself also
[1:03:19] helpeth our infirmities
[1:03:21] for we know not what we should pray for
[1:03:24] as we alt
[1:03:25] but the spirit itself make it
[1:03:27] intercession for
[1:03:28] us with groaning which cannot be
[1:03:32] uttered and he that searches the hearts
[1:03:36] knoweth what is the mind of the spirit
[1:03:39] because
[1:03:40] he maketh intercession for the saints
[1:03:43] according to the
[1:03:44] will of god it says and we know
[1:03:47] that all things work together for good
[1:03:50] to
[1:03:50] them that love god to them who
[1:03:54] are the called according to his purpose
[1:03:57] amen let's turn over to second
[1:03:59] corinthians
[1:04:00] chapter 12. second corinthians chapter
[1:04:04] 12 and
[1:04:06] i i hope uh wherever you are you can
[1:04:10] adjust because i'm kind of a big mouth
[1:04:12] you know i i believe in giving it my all
[1:04:15] you know so second corinthians chapter
[1:04:19] 12.
[1:04:20] um let's just make the reading show
[1:04:23] let's start at verse seven
[1:04:26] the bible says unless i should be
[1:04:28] exalted above measure
[1:04:29] through the abundance of revelation
[1:04:31] there was given me
[1:04:33] a thorn in the flesh the messenger of
[1:04:36] satan to buffet me lest i should be
[1:04:38] exalted
[1:04:39] above measure for this i've assaulted
[1:04:41] the lord
[1:04:42] thrice that it might be that it might
[1:04:45] depart from me
[1:04:46] and he said unto me my grace is
[1:04:49] sufficient for thee
[1:04:50] for my strength is made perfect in
[1:04:53] weakness
[1:04:54] most gladly therefore would i rather
[1:04:55] glory in my
[1:04:57] infirmities that the power of christ
[1:05:01] may rest upon me amen may the lord bless
[1:05:04] you love his word
[1:05:05] you can have your seats you know today
[1:05:08] by the grace of god
[1:05:10] i kind of want to preach a thought
[1:05:12] that's kind of personal amen
[1:05:14] you know i think that the lord is he's
[1:05:17] making our christian journey
[1:05:19] you know more and more personal that
[1:05:21] we're not just church members we're
[1:05:23] we're not just coming to a building to
[1:05:25] see one another
[1:05:26] but we're living what we believe amen
[1:05:29] and you know today i want to
[1:05:30] use for a subject god turning my
[1:05:33] negatives
[1:05:34] into a positive hallelujah you know he's
[1:05:36] turning my negative to a positive
[1:05:38] you know as we look in the scripture and
[1:05:41] if we take
[1:05:42] paul you know paul had a lot of things
[1:05:45] he went through
[1:05:46] you know if i could just you know relate
[1:05:48] some of them to you know
[1:05:50] the bible says he spent a night and day
[1:05:52] in the sea
[1:05:53] you know he was whipped i believe like
[1:05:55] five times you know there was one place
[1:05:57] in the scripture
[1:05:58] where he was stoned and he was even
[1:06:00] thrown over the wall
[1:06:01] for the gospel sakes but church paul
[1:06:04] come back through
[1:06:05] all that trouble all the negative things
[1:06:07] that happened in his life
[1:06:09] and he said if i glory if i find any
[1:06:11] peace
[1:06:12] if there's if there's any refuge in
[1:06:14] anything that happened to me
[1:06:16] that i will glory in the thing that i've
[1:06:19] suffered hallelujah
[1:06:20] because paul looking at all the negative
[1:06:23] things in his life
[1:06:24] saying hey i must be in the will of god
[1:06:27] so i have to look at these things
[1:06:29] from a positive lens hallelujah how
[1:06:32] often
[1:06:33] do we look at the troubles in our lives
[1:06:35] and we say
[1:06:36] oh the devil did this and oh the devil
[1:06:38] did that and
[1:06:39] the devil the devil the devil everything
[1:06:42] is not always the devil hallelujah
[1:06:44] some things that happen in our life you
[1:06:46] know the negative things in our lives
[1:06:48] are there for our strengthening
[1:06:50] hallelujah
[1:06:51] so i would rather like paul and this is
[1:06:54] my desire
[1:06:55] like paul i would rather glory in the
[1:06:57] things i suffered hallelujah
[1:06:59] because church if you remember and you
[1:07:01] complain
[1:07:02] about the things you're going through
[1:07:04] are you saying
[1:07:05] you that the devil has control of your
[1:07:07] life oh
[1:07:09] as a son and god son and daughter of god
[1:07:12] we ought to look at all the things we're
[1:07:14] going through and say
[1:07:16] god you're still in control you know i
[1:07:18] want to read you a quote
[1:07:20] you know when i first came across this
[1:07:22] it was just mind-boggling hallelujah
[1:07:25] because you know a lot of times we we
[1:07:28] we hear scripture but it don't click to
[1:07:31] a certain moment hallelujah
[1:07:32] listen this is this is in the message um
[1:07:36] um uh pre-planned by god hallelujah
[1:07:39] listen he says your birth
[1:07:44] he says your birth here was pre-planned
[1:07:47] he said i guess you believe that every
[1:07:49] one of you
[1:07:50] know that our birth was pre-planned did
[1:07:54] you know
[1:07:54] hallelujah did you know that you being
[1:07:57] here
[1:07:58] never originated just at a myth or a
[1:08:01] thought
[1:08:01] listen where you are right now
[1:08:04] hallelujah
[1:08:04] where i am right now it was all
[1:08:07] pre-planned by god
[1:08:09] but we say we're here because of cover
[1:08:11] 19 no
[1:08:12] ha-ha this has nothing to do with cover
[1:08:15] 19
[1:08:15] this is the mind of god and see what we
[1:08:18] look at to be negative
[1:08:20] god is saying no i'm going to turn that
[1:08:22] negative into a positive hallelujah
[1:08:24] i'm going to take covert 19 and i'm
[1:08:26] going to make it into hallelujah
[1:08:27] a time of prayer hallelujah i'm going to
[1:08:30] make it into a
[1:08:31] time of fellowship between families amen
[1:08:33] i'ma show them
[1:08:34] that when they can't go to work i'm
[1:08:36] still a provider amen
[1:08:38] god took the negative and turned it into
[1:08:40] a positive hallelujah
[1:08:42] but it was already pre-planned god knew
[1:08:45] hallelujah
[1:08:45] god knew by copeland 19 just like he
[1:08:48] knew about
[1:08:49] the age epidemic harley the flu and
[1:08:52] ebola and all these other sicknesses
[1:08:54] holy
[1:08:55] god had already made a way of escape
[1:08:58] what was it
[1:08:58] it's called calvary's cross hallelujah
[1:09:02] church listen he said did you know that
[1:09:04] you've been here
[1:09:06] never originated just as a myth or a
[1:09:08] thought everything was
[1:09:10] all pre-planned by god before the
[1:09:13] foundation of the world
[1:09:14] that you're here now just to make that a
[1:09:17] little bit more simpler
[1:09:19] hallelujah that you could see where i'm
[1:09:21] going see what i want to do today
[1:09:24] by the grace of god i want to strip
[1:09:26] satan from all his power
[1:09:28] holy that's what we ought to do amen as
[1:09:31] a believer
[1:09:33] you are not to never give satan more
[1:09:35] power than you ought to have
[1:09:37] and whatever power he has over you you
[1:09:39] gave it to him hallelujah
[1:09:41] because church look god is the creator
[1:09:43] of all
[1:09:44] and he said all things were created for
[1:09:46] him and by him oh my
[1:09:49] wow hallelujah you mean to tell me god

[1:09:53] sickness so the purpose of god could be
[1:09:55] fulfilled
[1:09:57] hallelujah church i don't know about you
[1:10:01] but
[1:10:02] i'm seeing god move in such a mighty way
[1:10:05] in this time in hour but you know i want
[1:10:07] to talk about
[1:10:08] trouble you know we look at our troubles
[1:10:10] we look at our trials
[1:10:11] and sometimes we ask the question lord
[1:10:14] why me well i want to change it around
[1:10:15] today
[1:10:16] lord why not me hallelujah because what
[1:10:19] trouble does
[1:10:20] the prophet god says hallelujah i quoted
[1:10:22] this witch tonight
[1:10:23] he said god takes trouble and puts a bit
[1:10:26] in his mouth
[1:10:27] and he harnesses
[1:10:30] god controls the trouble god controls
[1:10:34] every negative in your life
[1:10:37] you know that's why we read romans the
[1:10:40] 8th chapter
[1:10:41] because the bible says in romans 8 it
[1:10:43] says but
[1:10:44] he says and we know that all things work
[1:10:47] together
[1:10:48] for good to them that love god
[1:10:51] to the call to who are the called
[1:10:53] according to his purpose listen he says
[1:10:55] all things work together let's look at
[1:10:58] that work together
[1:10:59] what's working together my negative and
[1:11:02] my positive
[1:11:03] they're working together for my good
[1:11:05] amen
[1:11:06] now if you take a car hey man most of
[1:11:08] you who
[1:11:09] got cars in your front yard or wherever
[1:11:11] you may be you drive to work or
[1:11:12] whatever it is if you ride a scooter you
[1:11:15] ride a motorcycle
[1:11:16] whatever kind of horsepower you got
[1:11:18] hallelujah listen
[1:11:19] if it's buried if it battery oriented
[1:11:22] hugs
[1:11:23] if it runs by battery amen you could
[1:11:25] have gasoline
[1:11:26] you could have spark plugs you have
[1:11:28] everything mechanically in the right
[1:11:30] place
[1:11:31] holder and you can have a battery amen
[1:11:33] and that battery has to hook up
[1:11:35] to a positive hallelujah but you know
[1:11:36] what it's no good
[1:11:38] without the negative ground hallelujah
[1:11:41] that car
[1:11:42] that scooter that motorcycle that
[1:11:44] airplane that bus
[1:11:45] that train none of it is going no way
[1:11:47] without a negative ground
[1:11:50] so you have to have that negative
[1:11:52] working with the positive hollywood for
[1:11:54] things to work together
[1:11:56] hallelujah think about the church god
[1:11:59] uses the trouble and the negative things
[1:12:01] in your life to produce more positive
[1:12:04] character out of us
[1:12:06] hallelujah and you know if you you can
[1:12:08] go outside today just to test this
[1:12:10] theory
[1:12:11] go outside unhook your negative battery
[1:12:14] hold it
[1:12:14] unhook the negative ground i guarantee
[1:12:17] you your car won't work
[1:12:19] i guarantee you your motorcycle won't
[1:12:21] work hardly
[1:12:22] why because you need a negative in your
[1:12:24] life
[1:12:26] you know we look at it we say oh why am
[1:12:28] i going through this
[1:12:29] why am i going through that it's simple
[1:12:31] you're being perfected
[1:12:34] and the only way you can realize that
[1:12:36] you're being changed
[1:12:38] by the things you overcome hallelujah so
[1:12:41] you have to overcome something
[1:12:42] so you can see a positive amen and you
[1:12:45] know the negative
[1:12:46] holy god turning my negative into a
[1:12:48] positive my own personal testimony
[1:12:50] you know at a very young age i had
[1:12:53] cancer and this this wasn't just a
[1:12:54] regular cancer
[1:12:55] it was cancelling my brain hallelujah it
[1:12:58] was affecting my body it was affecting
[1:13:00] what i eat i was having headaches all
[1:13:02] these things it was such a negative time
[1:13:05] i beg to differ hallelujah because god
[1:13:08] used that negative moment
[1:13:10] to bring out a revelation that was
[1:13:12] already lying in me hardly
[1:13:14] so god used something negative huddly
[1:13:16] like cancer
[1:13:17] to bring out a positive revelation of
[1:13:20] jehovah
[1:13:20] rapha whoa hallelujah see he turned the
[1:13:24] negative
[1:13:25] into a positive and to this day when i
[1:13:27] get sick
[1:13:28] i just turn around and say oh jehovah
[1:13:30] tyra
[1:13:31] oh jehovah rapper what are you finna do
[1:13:33] now
[1:13:35] okay what do you do when you see trouble
[1:13:38] coming
[1:13:39] right now you know wherever you might be
[1:13:41] whether it's a
[1:13:42] it's a a monitor or you're just sitting
[1:13:45] in a church and
[1:13:46] different things no doubt you got lights
[1:13:48] around amen those lights
[1:13:50] can't even work without a negative
[1:13:51] ground
[1:13:53] you can't even get a sign over you
[1:13:56] without a negative ground
[1:13:58] the room won't even light up if
[1:13:59] negativity is not even present
[1:14:05] see so we ought to look at things
[1:14:06] different amen look church
[1:14:08] it's all through the scripture holy god
[1:14:11] he always allows negative to show his
[1:14:14] head
[1:14:14] so he can show his power remember in the
[1:14:16] book of job
[1:14:17] when the sons of god came to present
[1:14:20] themselves before the lord
[1:14:21] and the bible says and the devil came
[1:14:26] also
[1:14:29] oh god he allows negative things
[1:14:32] to come our way because it brings out
[1:14:35] more of him
[1:14:36] god allowed job what did you see about
[1:14:38] job
[1:14:39] negative negative negative losses lost
[1:14:42] his money negative
[1:14:43] lost his cattle negative lost his
[1:14:45] children negative
[1:14:46] lost his wife negative all of that just
[1:14:49] to prove to the devil he couldn't be
[1:14:51] shaken
[1:14:54] now what do you do when you meet all the
[1:14:56] trouble in your lives huh
[1:14:58] what do you do when you have trials and
[1:15:00] tribulations
[1:15:01] what do you do when everything is not
[1:15:03] going the way you expect it to go
[1:15:05] hallelujah
[1:15:06] look church hey man if we if we we if we
[1:15:09] look at
[1:15:10] the negative hey man listen god
[1:15:13] turning my negative into a positive
[1:15:16] hallelujah look
[1:15:17] the reason why i read paul again look
[1:15:20] paul said
[1:15:22] it's because of the revelation in me
[1:15:27] it's because of the understanding god
[1:15:30] has given me
[1:15:31] that god sends a messenger of
[1:15:34] satan to buffet him so that he could
[1:15:37] stay
[1:15:38] humble oh my heart god sent a messenger
[1:15:42] to a prophet hallelujah always messing
[1:15:44] with him i think brother branham said
[1:15:46] paul had trouble with his eyesight
[1:15:48] hallelujah and you know
[1:15:49] why did he have trouble with his
[1:15:50] eyesight so he wouldn't get lifted up
[1:15:53] in all the revelations that he had so
[1:15:55] god had to keep
[1:15:56] a negative in his life so he could
[1:15:58] remain positive
[1:16:00] hallelujah in church you wonder why you
[1:16:03] keep going in circles and some things
[1:16:04] because god don't want you to get
[1:16:06] exalted god wants you
[1:16:08] to stay humble and that way he can
[1:16:10] continue to use you
[1:16:12] hallelujah you know what the enemy does
[1:16:14] the enemy fights me a lot
[1:16:16] with my finances he said hey how you
[1:16:18] gonna be full-time time
[1:16:20] in the midst of covert 19 how you going
[1:16:22] to be full-time
[1:16:23] traveling when you can't travel amen i
[1:16:24] say i don't know it ain't up to me
[1:16:26] it's up to god hallelujah
[1:16:30] see it don't belong to me not my will
[1:16:33] but your will be done
[1:16:34] see it's according to how we look at the
[1:16:37] situation
[1:16:38] and one thing i want you to understand
[1:16:40] today that
[1:16:42] satan is not controlling anything
[1:16:45] hallelujah
[1:16:46] church god is not on the the defense of
[1:16:49] what satan is doing no
[1:16:51] god is always on the offense amen he's
[1:16:54] not on the defense trying to say
[1:16:56] oh i got to stop the devil oh i got to
[1:16:58] stop this oh i can't let him
[1:16:59] no satan is trying to stop god from
[1:17:02] moving hollering
[1:17:03] god is always on the offense hallelujah
[1:17:05] oh man
[1:17:06] you know church as i looked and i began
[1:17:08] to think about
[1:17:10] you know god throughout all the
[1:17:12] scriptures he took the negative
[1:17:14] and he turned it into a positive but in
[1:17:16] that moment
[1:17:17] the believer 9 is out of 10 they
[1:17:19] couldn't see it as a positive
[1:17:23] they wondered why this and why that and
[1:17:26] why am i going to listen
[1:17:27] look abraham god gave him a promise but
[1:17:30] to get to that promise
[1:17:31] he had to experience a lot of negative
[1:17:33] things first
[1:17:34] he had to experience a man a friction
[1:17:37] between his family
[1:17:38] friction between him and his nephew
[1:17:40] arguing and fussing
[1:17:42] look look his nephew is fussing with him
[1:17:45] about a land god has already given to
[1:17:48] abraham
[1:17:51] and look the devil's fussing with us
[1:17:53] about things god has already given to us
[1:17:56] hallelujah there's a sister at my church
[1:17:58] mira were talking she's trying to sell a
[1:18:00] house
[1:18:01] and buy another house and you know she
[1:18:04] started to think and think about how
[1:18:05] great god is
[1:18:06] and she said lord in the bible days
[1:18:09] you were giving out whole mountains
[1:18:13] lord lord you were giving out mountains
[1:18:16] surely a little
[1:18:17] three thousand square foot house is
[1:18:19] nothing to you hallelujah
[1:18:20] if you were giving up mountains and and
[1:18:23] land upon land and you told abraham
[1:18:26] as far as your eye can see it belongs to
[1:18:28] you surely you can sell a house
[1:18:33] surely you can give me the finances to
[1:18:34] buy another one
[1:18:37] when he's giving away whole mountains
[1:18:40] church
[1:18:40] we serve a powerful god this is not the
[1:18:43] time to be dismayed
[1:18:44] i'm here to proclaim today that your
[1:18:47] troubles are working for your good
[1:18:49] hallelujah and we got scripture to back
[1:18:51] it up the scripture says
[1:18:53] trouble don't last always and i'll give
[1:18:56] you another one church
[1:18:57] he said hallelujah in the time of
[1:18:59] trouble he shall hide me
[1:19:02] hallelujah so whom shall we fear church
[1:19:06] god is always working that negative to a
[1:19:08] positive hollywood
[1:19:10] and y'all know me those who have heard
[1:19:11] me preach before you know i ain't gonna
[1:19:13] be long i'm about to close hardly
[1:19:15] how i don't have punchlines where you
[1:19:17] say oh read me something i've never
[1:19:19] heard
[1:19:20] no catch the inspiration holly catch the
[1:19:22] inspiration
[1:19:24] that your troubles hallelujah you're
[1:19:25] negative hallelujah
[1:19:27] god is using that hallelujah to create a
[1:19:29] positive amen
[1:19:30] hallelujah before we got in this digital
[1:19:33] age
[1:19:34] we took pictures through cameras harley
[1:19:36] and those cameras had to be developed
[1:19:38] where in a dark room hurry but you never
[1:19:41] got the picture without
[1:19:42] a negative that's good
[1:19:45] oh the picture couldn't even be
[1:19:48] developed
[1:19:49] without a negative hunger
[1:19:52] in church sometimes we forget how simple
[1:19:55] god is
[1:19:56] but if you even go back to that see you
[1:19:59] millennials don't know what we're
[1:20:00] talking about
[1:20:01] hello but there was a time where they
[1:20:03] had to take
[1:20:04] pictures and they had to wait and had to
[1:20:07] put it i believe in a certain substance
[1:20:08] and
[1:20:09] and it had to be developed hallelujah
[1:20:11] but it was all
[1:20:12] in a negative form harley hey man
[1:20:15] and then once it was developed you know
[1:20:17] what if you lost that picture
[1:20:19] you could get it back why because you
[1:20:21] kept the negative wow
[1:20:25] it's the negative that can bring you
[1:20:27] back to life again
[1:20:29] it's the negative that can show who you
[1:20:31] really are
[1:20:32] amen it was the negative stuff that job
[1:20:35] was going through
[1:20:36] that really showed he was the son of god
[1:20:40] hallelujah so it ain't always the
[1:20:43] mountain top
[1:20:43] praise god i thank god for the
[1:20:45] mountaintop but sometimes
[1:20:47] it's the negative things you go through
[1:20:49] that shows the real character of who you
[1:20:51] are
[1:20:52] hallelujah you know if a man really
[1:20:54] loves his wife
[1:20:55] if he loses his job maybe a job he had
[1:20:58] for 20 years
[1:20:59] he lose that job but he said lord if i
[1:21:01] got the home of myself
[1:21:02] to go work at kings and and make some
[1:21:05] chicken or
[1:21:05] or work at burger king and make some
[1:21:08] burgers but i got to provide for my
[1:21:10] family hallelujah
[1:21:11] see in that moment god is showing his
[1:21:13] family
[1:21:14] his character hallelujah that he'll do
[1:21:17] whatever he has to do
[1:21:18] that his family will be provided for but
[1:21:21] it took a negative moment
[1:21:23] hallelujah going it always takes a
[1:21:26] negative moment
[1:21:28] to bring forth a positive amen
[1:21:29] hallelujah just like it was
[1:21:31] with luther luther look at all the
[1:21:33] negativity going into the catholic
[1:21:35] church
[1:21:36] and luther says i'm sick of it to just
[1:21:38] shall live by faith holly

[1:21:51] hollywood who had clean lives
[1:21:53] holy but wouldn't let god have the
[1:21:55] preeminence
[1:21:58] so all that negative brought in a
[1:22:01] greater understanding
[1:22:02] it brought in a greater positive
[1:22:04] hallelujah to the place
[1:22:05] to our prophet looked at pentecost

[1:22:21] your life

[1:34:05] i'm still here
[1:34:07] what is it holy is god using my negative
[1:34:10] to the positive

[1:34:16] things we suffer
[1:34:18] look if jesus was made strong made
[1:34:20] perfect
[1:34:21] by the things he suffered what about us
[1:34:25] the bible says he's a god that can be
[1:34:27] touched by the feelings of your
[1:34:29] infirmities
[1:34:30] so that means there's nothing that we
[1:34:32] can go through that god hasn't already

[1:35:30] hallelujah you can't tell me what you're
[1:35:32] going through
[1:35:33] that god can't turn that negative into a
[1:35:35] positive that's right
[1:35:38] you look at the cross and they say well
[1:35:40] we're going to crucify him
[1:35:42] one of the most horrendous deaths that
[1:35:45] man could ever produce hallelujah
[1:35:47] put a man on a cross and nail him to it
[1:35:50] hollywood
[1:35:50] that he'll die of suffocation because he
[1:35:53] can't
[1:35:54] get enough strip in his lungs to breathe
[1:35:56] god turned that depth into a positive
[1:35:59] wow god turn your negative my into
[1:36:02] a positive
[1:36:04] hallelujah oh my church listen
[1:36:08] listen as i prepare to close listen to
[1:36:10] me
[1:36:15] everybody all right say amen listen
[1:36:19] listen to the message i know this is a
[1:36:21] powerful message now
[1:36:22] hallelujah hurry listen he says
[1:36:25] and sometimes we have more troubles
[1:36:29] when we become a christian can i get
[1:36:32] amen
[1:36:33] you know the devil want to tell you
[1:36:34] everything was good before you got
[1:36:36] baptized everything was good before you
[1:36:39] became a
[1:36:40] message believer when you was a baptist
[1:36:42] you ain't had all these problems when
[1:36:44] you was a pentecostal
[1:36:45] you had all those problems you know why
[1:36:47] because in that state
[1:36:48] you'd never become perfect
[1:36:52] but when you step into an atmosphere
[1:36:54] where you can be with perfect when you
[1:36:55] can be perfected
[1:36:56] when you become perfect the hammer and
[1:36:58] the chisel it goes a little bit faster
[1:37:03] you know i got a quote from michelangelo
[1:37:06] michelangelo
[1:37:06] hallelujah he says in every stone
[1:37:09] there's an angel
[1:37:10] you just have to beat it out hallelujah
[1:37:13] oh
[1:37:14] yeah so whenever he looks at stone he
[1:37:16] sees an
[1:37:17] image of it hallelujah in his mind so he
[1:37:20] starts the hammering and covering
[1:37:21] hallelujah so his mind always comes in
[1:37:24] front of him
[1:37:25] as he begins to work through the trial
[1:37:27] of hammering and beating hallelujah
[1:37:29] and god's doing the same thing in us
[1:37:31] hallelujah he can see
[1:37:32] who we really are but what does he do he
[1:37:34] hammers and he beats he hammers and he
[1:37:36] beats
[1:37:37] he sees sons and daughters of god in us
[1:37:39] already
[1:37:40] but he has to bring out the hammer and
[1:37:42] chisel
[1:37:44] to bring us into the image of his mind
[1:37:47] listen he said then we he said he said
[1:37:49] he he said
[1:37:50] when we become a christian then we did
[1:37:52] when we were uh
[1:37:53] sinners we had more troubles than we
[1:37:55] become christians then we were sinners
[1:37:57] he says cause it is written
[1:38:00] many is the affliction of the righteous
[1:38:03] i ought to be in the clothes right there
[1:38:05] i can close and walk away right there
[1:38:07] that's your answer to everything you're
[1:38:09] going through
[1:38:10] you can look at your child today and say
[1:38:13] the bible says
[1:38:15] many of the afflictions of the righteous
[1:38:18] now i know i try to live a righteous
[1:38:20] life
[1:38:20] so therefore my righteousness is
[1:38:23] connected to affliction
[1:38:25] whoa
[1:38:28] oh let's change it around my afflictions
[1:38:32] is connected to the righteousness of god
[1:38:34] oh yeah
[1:38:35] but then the bible says but the lord
[1:38:37] delivered them out of them all
[1:38:41] hallelujah hallelujah he said but god
[1:38:44] delivered him from them all
[1:38:46] god promised many afflictions god now
[1:38:48] listen the prophet is saying
[1:38:50] god promised many afflictions he
[1:38:53] promised
[1:38:54] negativity oh my
[1:38:59] oh my he said he promised me the
[1:39:02] affliction
[1:39:03] strange feelings and strange things that
[1:39:06] will be
[1:39:07] beyond our understanding now i know
[1:39:11] as believers as sons and daughters of
[1:39:13] god we go through things that we don't
[1:39:15] understand
[1:39:16] right hell yeah and i'd be the first one
[1:39:19] to say amen to that
[1:39:20] holy i've been through some stuff that i
[1:39:23] don't understand

[1:39:27] word in your mouth
[1:39:29] that you ought not to never use when it
[1:39:30] comes to god why
[1:39:34] y'all never let that word form up in
[1:39:36] your mouth why
[1:39:37] god always has a purpose always has a
[1:39:39] purpose
[1:39:40] don't question god he always has a
[1:39:42] purpose hell yeah
[1:39:44] listen he said if things happen that we
[1:39:45] don't understand but look he says but
[1:39:48] it's always done for our good
[1:39:54] amen hallelujah let's close
[1:39:58] church there'll be many things that
[1:40:00] happen
[1:40:01] that we don't understand but it always
[1:40:03] works for our good

[1:40:16] for your good now you ought to rejoice

[1:43:29] he said well this well the monsoons came
[1:43:31] to share
[1:43:32] a little bit more than we expected and
[1:43:34] it washed away my house
[1:43:35] god got a bigger house
[1:43:40] he said we could grasp that today or
[1:43:42] this morning if we could grasp
[1:43:44] that all our troubles he said and

[1:43:58] developing more and more
[1:43:59] character out of our prophet god allowed
[1:44:02] that to happen why
[1:44:04] because way down inside brother branham
[1:44:06] had a lying spirit
[1:44:07] [Music]
[1:44:10] don't cut me off now don't cut me off
[1:44:13] he's in the message don't cut me out
[1:44:18] that pressure god put pressure on him
[1:44:21] god put negativity on him why
[1:44:23] so god could get that little bit of line
[1:44:25] out of him
[1:44:26] that little bit of love that nobody else
[1:44:28] see and he said hey honey
[1:44:29] tell them i'm not in here and media came
[1:44:31] back say bill that wasn't just right he

[1:44:42] brother went out to pray and god said
[1:44:44] get your hand off that child
[1:44:46] you ain't fit to pray far cause you just
[1:44:48] told a lie
[1:44:49] so you know what he did see the heart of
[1:44:52] a true servant
[1:44:53] when you find out you're wrong you don't
[1:44:55] play games with god you fall on your
[1:44:57] knees and repent

[1:45:01] of david a man after god's very own
[1:45:03] heart
[1:45:04] holy as many times david did wrong as
[1:45:06] much negative came into his life
[1:45:08] david always repented
[1:45:12] he turned that negative into a positive
[1:45:16] wow listen
[1:45:20] he said if we could realize that those
[1:45:23] things
[1:45:24] are for our good it is written in one of
[1:45:28] the scriptures
[1:45:29] in the bible that trials are brought
[1:45:32] upon us
[1:45:33] hallelujah more precious to us than gold
[1:45:36] itself
[1:45:37] for is god listen he said for it is god

[1:46:03] confession
[1:46:04] after you say lord i'll serve you lord
[1:46:06] you're my god you're my savior
[1:46:08] he said every trial from that confession
[1:46:11] from that moment
[1:46:12] is put into your life to perfect you
[1:46:16] so we ought to be rejoicing amen you
[1:46:18] have to look around right now

[1:46:45] they were getting bigger checks every
[1:46:47] week sitting at home than they was
[1:46:49] working a job

[1:47:05] for his glory
[1:47:06] it's to bring us to a place where god
[1:47:09] can make himself more
[1:47:10] real to us than he was before the trial
[1:47:14] come
[1:47:15] so what's all this about and i'm i'm
[1:47:18] preparing to close

[1:52:46] stood there before
[1:52:47] hollywood two two men that could be his
[1:52:49] judge uh
[1:52:50] uh festus and uh what was the other
[1:52:52] brother name um

[1:52:58] and they looking like they got control
[1:52:59] of his life paul looked him in their
[1:53:01] face and say for this purpose i came
[1:53:06] he said you don't want to go to rome
[1:53:07] you're going to die this net paul say

[1:53:16] jail time hardly he had his journey
[1:53:19] hallelujah
[1:53:20] it came with a sentencing of jail huh
[1:53:22] why why did paul have to go to jail

[1:53:27] get some of the new testament
[1:53:28] out of him hallelujah he had to sit in
[1:53:31] jail and white
[1:53:32] write philippians and galatians and
[1:53:34] different books whoa

[1:53:38] the field he could only write those
[1:53:40] books while he was in jail
[1:53:41] hallelujah because there's one
[1:53:43] particular part where paul says

[1:53:49] oh hallelujah church there are things in
[1:53:52] your life
[1:53:52] negatives that god turns into a positive
[1:53:55] amen
[1:53:56] look holy david committed adultery with
[1:53:59] besheba
[1:54:00] and god brought a positive idea what was
[1:54:02] it psalm 51
[1:54:03] created me a clean heart
[1:54:06] take not that holy spirit for me she had
[1:54:09] all that negative god still got a
[1:54:11] positive out of it
[1:54:13] how many of us sing that song and that
[1:54:15] psalm brings us into the presence of god
[1:54:18] but david had to experience a negative
[1:54:20] so we can experience the positive
[1:54:22] and you know the scripture says god says
[1:54:24] i'll take away hallelujah
[1:54:26] the first to establish the second
[1:54:28] hallelujah he'll take away this negative
[1:54:30] hallelujah he'll take away this flesh
[1:54:32] hallelujah
[1:54:33] what to establish hallelujah the spirit
[1:54:35] man
[1:54:36] that's why he says you must be born
[1:54:38] again
[1:54:40] he allows us to experience the negative

[1:56:50] amen and brother aaron will come behind
[1:56:51] me amen and maybe lead just a few songs
[1:56:54] and brother and if you have anything you
[1:56:55] want to share
[1:56:56] feel free amen i just want to encourage
[1:56:58] you today i
[1:57:00] i believe that that sermon that was
[1:57:02] preached
[1:57:03] that god put that inspiration upon now
[1:57:06] he could have preached anything
[1:57:08] but god specifically put that
[1:57:10] inspiration on brother diggs heart
[1:57:12] for a specific need multiple needs in
[1:57:16] our life
[1:57:17] and so as you if you stand to your feet
[1:57:19] with me if you're standing by your heads
[1:57:21] with me
[1:57:22] amen all across the building there at
[1:57:23] home amen the musicians just play
[1:57:26] something softly for me
[1:57:27] i want to say to you today the bible
[1:57:29] says all things
[1:57:31] work together for the good of
[1:57:34] those that are called according to his
[1:57:37] purpose
[1:57:37] those that love him and are called
[1:57:38] according to his purpose now it doesn't
[1:57:41] say that all things
[1:57:42] that happened to us are good because not
[1:57:45] everything that happens is good as we
[1:57:46] heard today
[1:57:47] it's the negative that god uses us to
[1:57:50] bring out the positive amen to fulfill
[1:57:53] his purposes
[1:57:54] he uses negative in our life i thought
[1:57:56] of so many
[1:57:58] examples brother diggs gave now every
[1:58:00] head bowed now every act closed
[1:58:03] amen i thought of so many examples today
[1:58:06] and uh and my mind just raced as i
[1:58:08] thought of this example in this example
[1:58:10] of how many times
[1:58:12] through what we would in our own human
[1:58:14] intellect have a misunderstanding even
[1:58:16] things that we read about in the bible
[1:58:18] we say why did sarah have to be barren
[1:58:20] why why do you read stories like jonah
[1:58:22] getting swallowed up by a well
[1:58:24] and god used that for a purpose why did
[1:58:27] i thought about that example brother dig
[1:58:29] brother diggs gave of of the mother of
[1:58:31] moses how that you know she gives up her
[1:58:33] baby to try to save his life and she
[1:58:35] didn't know
[1:58:36] throughout all that negativity when she
[1:58:38] was putting moses in that
[1:58:40] in that in that ark uh brother branham
[1:58:42] said in that ark and that in that
[1:58:44] enclosure
[1:58:45] and put him on the nile river in the
[1:58:46] midst of crocodiles and alligators
[1:58:49] she had no idea that it was in that
[1:58:51] negative moment that out of that
[1:58:53] negativity
[1:58:54] would bring her deliverance and and all
[1:58:58] of god's people's deliverance think
[1:58:59] about that friends
[1:59:00] now now we could look at bible stories
[1:59:02] we could think of the negative that
[1:59:04] happened to the prophet's life
[1:59:05] even the story brother diggs gave about
[1:59:07] the little girl being prayed for
[1:59:09] and god had to use it to get brother
[1:59:11] brandon's attention over something you
[1:59:12] think of the
[1:59:13] i could i could give you a hundred
[1:59:15] different examples
[1:59:17] but i i want you to zero in down zero
[1:59:20] down further on your life this morning
[1:59:22] amen zero down further on your life this
[1:59:24] morning
[1:59:25] and i want you to i want you to think
[1:59:28] just here for a moment
[1:59:29] with your head bowed what about that
[1:59:30] negative in your life
[1:59:32] what about that negative situation or
[1:59:34] that negative report of the negative
[1:59:36] spirit maybe it's just a negative spirit
[1:59:38] you feel in your life
[1:59:39] and ask yourself today god what why have
[1:59:42] you placed that
[1:59:43] buffer as you did paul that thorn it's
[1:59:46] for a purpose lord
[1:59:47] you put it there for a reason and oh
[1:59:49] here's what i believe with my hands
[1:59:51] raised
[1:59:51] here's what i believe all things work
[1:59:54] together not all things are good
[1:59:56] but all things work together for the
[1:59:58] good of those that love him those that
[2:00:00] are called according to his purpose
[2:00:02] and so i i want to with your head bowed
[2:00:04] your eyes closed i want you just to
[2:00:06] just for a moment i want to read you
[2:00:09] this
[2:00:10] uh this quote here head bowed eye closed
[2:00:12] brother branham says brother diggs
[2:00:13] quoted this
[2:00:14] he says that when your faith is put to a
[2:00:16] test then don't fail
[2:00:18] stay right with what you believe and
[2:00:21] when their faith was put to a test
[2:00:24] when they went to a crucial hour not
[2:00:26] only did they go to an
[2:00:28] ash heap but they went into a fiery
[2:00:30] furnace
[2:00:31] but satan could not destroy them for
[2:00:34] god's purpose
[2:00:35] wasn't yet fulfilled they could go in
[2:00:37] there with this hope
[2:00:38] i know my redeemer liveth they could go
[2:00:41] in there with this hope
[2:00:42] we are assured that god is able to
[2:00:44] deliver us from this fiery furnace but
[2:00:46] nevertheless we will not bow to the
[2:00:48] image
[2:00:49] satan could not take them he could not
[2:00:52] drown noah in the flood
[2:00:53] until the purpose of god had been
[2:00:55] finished he could not burn up the hebrew
[2:00:57] children until the purpose of god had
[2:00:59] been finished
[2:01:00] he could not kill job with boils and
[2:01:02] troubles until the purpose of god had
[2:01:04] been finished neither could the lions
[2:01:06] eat daniel
[2:01:07] until the purpose of god had been
[2:01:08] finished neither could death
[2:01:10] and old age take abraham until the
[2:01:13] purpose of god
[2:01:14] had been finished and neither can it
[2:01:16] take you
[2:01:17] or can it take me until the purpose of
[2:01:21] god
[2:01:21] of our life is finished so we gather
[2:01:25] from there with
[2:01:26] this consolation and why
[2:01:29] does god let troubles come god harnesses
[2:01:33] trouble puts bits in its mouth like a
[2:01:36] horse
[2:01:37] makes it obey him and those troubles
[2:01:40] bring us
[2:01:41] into a closer fellowship with god listen
[2:01:44] to what he says here
[2:01:45] there had been no rainbow until the
[2:01:48] flood came
[2:01:49] but after noah was pressed into that
[2:01:51] condition that he was in
[2:01:53] to float 40 days and nights in a storm
[2:01:55] and the ark pitching up and down in the
[2:01:57] water it was
[2:01:58] after the flood was over that he saw the
[2:02:01] rainbow for
[2:02:01] the for the first time the covenant of
[2:02:03] hope the covenant of promise
[2:02:05] after he had went through the
[2:02:07] tribulation then he saw the promise
[2:02:09] that's the way you see the promise after
[2:02:12] you've gone through the tribulation
[2:02:14] i've liked the poem or psalm that said
[2:02:16] must i be carried home to
[2:02:18] heaven on a flowery bed of ease while
[2:02:20] other while others fought to win the
[2:02:22] prize
[2:02:23] and sell through bloody seas we ask
[2:02:26] for comfort and peace and god gives us
[2:02:29] the best he could give us
[2:02:31] trials and tribulations that's
[2:02:34] better than the comfort and peace our
[2:02:37] comfort is just beyond the river
[2:02:40] oh listen to what the prophet says it
[2:02:41] was until
[2:02:43] it wasn't until the hebrew children was
[2:02:45] forced into the fiery furnace
[2:02:47] and on one of their most outstanding
[2:02:49] trials that they
[2:02:50] seen one like the son of god standing
[2:02:53] amongst them listen to the statement
[2:02:56] their
[2:02:56] troubles produced the son of god
[2:03:00] standing among them in the breezes to
[2:03:02] wave away the heat
[2:03:04] but not until they went into the fire
[2:03:07] did that
[2:03:07] comfort to repair it was daniel who had
[2:03:10] purposed in his heart
[2:03:11] that he would not defile himself with
[2:03:13] the things of the world and was forced
[2:03:14] through a trial
[2:03:15] whether he would go to pray to god or go
[2:03:17] to the lion's den but it was after the
[2:03:19] heat was put upon him
[2:03:20] that he was thrown into the lions then
[2:03:22] after that he saw the angel of the lord
[2:03:24] standing in the midst keeping away he
[2:03:26] says that great pillar of fire standing
[2:03:28] between him and the lions and the lions
[2:03:30] couldn't get to him because he had went
[2:03:32] through the trials
[2:03:33] and temptations and the troubles let me
[2:03:35] add through the negative
[2:03:37] and he knew that his god was able to
[2:03:40] deliver him now brother sisters with
[2:03:42] your head bowed your eyes closed
[2:03:44] amen you heard the sermon today i

[2:09:31] let's just bow our heads
[2:09:33] [Music]
[2:09:35] lord some hear this this morning in the
[2:09:37] tabernacle and
[2:09:39] some at home or some streaming from
[2:09:43] other parts of the country today
[2:09:46] they're looking at their own lives and
[2:09:47] they're seeing
[2:09:48] [Music]
[2:09:50] we as humans lord in a in the limited
[2:09:53] view that we have and
[2:09:54] [Music]
[2:09:56] we may think nobody else has suffered
[2:09:58] like we suffered and nobody's
[2:10:00] going through such a hard time as i'm
[2:10:02] going through
[2:10:04] that brother and that sister their life
[2:10:06] seems so much easier than mine
[2:10:09] they don't seem to have any issues at
[2:10:10] all they're always happy they always
[2:10:12] seem to be overcoming
[2:10:15] the lord until we walk in one another's
[2:10:17] shoes we would really understand one
[2:10:19] another
[2:10:21] and you know exactly how to test how to
[2:10:24] try
[2:10:25] what to bring in our lives to produce

[2:10:30] already these trials these heartaches
[2:10:34] these these times these these
[2:10:36] difficulties we go through it's not
[2:10:39] because
[2:10:40] you're trying to produce gold in us but

[2:10:48] already there
[2:10:49] these troubles these trials these these
[2:10:52] beatings lord

[2:10:59] if we were being left alone and there
[2:11:01] was not a thing going wrong in our life

[2:11:05] concerned in that place
