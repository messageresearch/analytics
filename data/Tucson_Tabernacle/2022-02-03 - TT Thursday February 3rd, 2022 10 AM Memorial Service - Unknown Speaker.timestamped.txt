[1:08:07] about
[1:08:53] i hired david one day to help me with a
[1:08:55] house and my brother was helping as well
[1:08:58] and
[1:08:59] and i was working on a ladder in the
[1:09:01] kitchen my brother was down there in the
[1:09:02] bedrooms doing something and david was
[1:09:04] out there by the front door and the
[1:09:06] inside he was
[1:09:07] bent over doing something i don't know
[1:09:08] what he was doing but he was acting like
[1:09:10] he was busy
[1:09:12] and all of a sudden the the doorbell
[1:09:14] rang
[1:09:18] puerto
[1:09:31] and i go back to the ladder and
[1:09:34] i go by david he's working down that i
[1:09:36] don't know what he was doing
[1:09:37] he's acting like he was doing something
[1:09:40] and i got up there on the ladder and
[1:09:41] that doorbell rings again
[1:09:43] so i get off the ladder i go back to the
[1:09:45] door open and there's nobody there
[1:09:50] yeah
[1:09:51] you know how strange
[1:09:53] so i go back to the kitchen i'm getting
[1:09:55] the back on the ladder and that doorbell
[1:09:56] rings the third time
[1:09:58] voice
[1:10:13] he was standing he was sitting there and
[1:10:14] he had the wire extended over and he was
[1:10:16] he was he was pushing the button on the
[1:10:18] on the doorbell
[1:10:19] and he never let me forget that either
[1:10:21] he's wanted
[1:10:23] he pulled something on you he'd never
[1:10:24] let you forget
[1:10:34] [Music]
[1:10:47] jordan this microphone right here
[1:10:59] thank y'all for coming to
[1:11:01] pay your respects
[1:11:32] there was nothing he couldn't do or
[1:11:33] couldn't fix
[1:11:53] and he started to take me to work
[1:12:16] listening to hammers and saws and nail
[1:12:18] guns
[1:12:20] guys yelling
[1:12:32] truck that he loves
[1:12:45] across the job site
[1:12:46] to where he was at once i found him
[1:12:58] it's about time
[1:13:23] uh
[1:13:45] he also took great practice working in
[1:13:46] himself
[1:13:48] he's tried to be the best the fastest
[1:13:50] the strongest
[1:13:51] the most productive guy on the job
[1:13:54] i remember
[1:14:05] um
[1:14:15] uh
[1:14:29] but uh but my that's the way my dad was
[1:14:31] he he wanted to work harder and better
[1:14:33] and faster than everybody else
[1:14:35] he wanted to be the strongest guy on the
[1:14:36] on the job site
[1:14:39] uh my dad was full of jokes full of
[1:14:42] stories uh
[1:14:44] most of when we heard i think it was
[1:14:46] only a handful of jokes and stories but
[1:14:47] we heard them so many times it seemed
[1:14:48] like a whole bunch
[1:14:52] i remember driving around with my dad
[1:14:55] around tucson and surrounding areas and
[1:14:57] stuff and be running errands or picking
[1:14:59] up material or just doing different
[1:15:00] things and
[1:15:02] he'd uh he'd point to a
[1:15:04] to a building or to a house or to a
[1:15:07] subdivision
[1:15:08] and uh first thing he would say i
[1:15:11] remember working over there back in uh
[1:15:13] you know back in 71 or whatever scott or
[1:15:16] a lloyd or you know whoever he was
[1:15:18] herman
[1:15:20] whoever he was working with you know and
[1:15:22] at the time
[1:15:24] and he was always so excited you know
[1:15:27] and he would tell me all the practical
[1:15:28] jokes and the stories that went along
[1:15:30] with each job site and each uh each of
[1:15:32] the his working buddies and stuff like
[1:15:34] that
[1:15:35] um
[1:15:39] and as time passed i felt kind of bad
[1:15:41] because he would he would you know point
[1:15:42] something out and he'd already showed me
[1:15:44] five times ten times you know building
[1:15:46] and what year and who you did it with
[1:15:47] and
[1:15:48] halfway through his sentence i'd finish
[1:15:50] the story for him and
[1:15:52] he would just kind of look at me and
[1:15:54] give me that serious face
[1:16:01] but the funny thing was whenever there
[1:16:02] was a new guy on the on the job site or
[1:16:05] you know somebody brought a
[1:16:07] a new person into the family
[1:16:10] he would always start with his jokes and
[1:16:11] his stories again
[1:16:12] and uh
[1:16:14] you know
[1:16:15] either me and david or somebody would
[1:16:16] dad we've already heard that 100 times
[1:16:18] come on he's all well they haven't leave
[1:16:20] me alone
[1:16:25] but uh
[1:16:26] i mean my dad as much as my dad loved
[1:16:28] work
[1:16:29] he loved his family too
[1:16:33] he didn't always convey it
[1:16:35] in an understandable way
[1:16:37] uh
[1:16:38] i can probably count on one hand
[1:16:40] and this is not saying anything bad
[1:16:41] about my dad but i can probably count on
[1:16:42] one hand you know the times he he said i
[1:16:44] love you tooie
[1:16:46] but but i know he did you know uh he's
[1:16:48] just
[1:16:49] that just wasn't the way he was and he
[1:16:50] was a he was a tough guy
[1:16:53] uh
[1:16:57] he my dad grew up he had a hard life he
[1:17:00] worked most of it and
[1:17:03] and he's at rest now
[1:17:04] and uh
[1:17:05] he's asleep he's asleep
[1:17:08] uh
[1:17:09] he was he wasn't a mushy guy so i
[1:17:11] understand
[1:17:13] but he did have a heart for people and
[1:17:14] his friends and family sometimes too big
[1:17:17] i know i'd get frustrated when when he
[1:17:19] would he was always trying to cut
[1:17:21] somebody a good deal give him a good
[1:17:22] price you know just that was his his
[1:17:24] main thing to help people out
[1:17:28] and
[1:17:29] that's great now i can see that now he
[1:17:30] used to frustrate me when when he was
[1:17:33] still doing it but uh
[1:17:35] that's the way he was
[1:17:41] as good as a a man as my dad was he
[1:17:44] wasn't perfect he had his flaws he made
[1:17:47] his mistakes
[1:17:48] i said some of the some wrong things at
[1:17:50] the wrong time sometimes
[1:17:52] he had his vices and his weaknesses just
[1:17:54] as we all do
[1:17:56] but he tried he tried his best at
[1:17:58] everything he did um
[1:18:01] you know and that's all we can do he
[1:18:03] he wasn't a perfect father but he was a
[1:18:05] great father he was as good as father as
[1:18:07] he could be and that's more than i can
[1:18:08] ask
[1:18:09] for um
[1:18:13] and i know for a fact something that
[1:18:15] that allows me to rest easy is that i
[1:18:17] know he loved the lord
[1:18:19] and i know that he feared the lord
[1:18:21] and i know that that was
[1:18:24] something that brings peace to me and
[1:18:25] and and i know that he's
[1:18:27] mateo julio now and my tea freddie and
[1:18:29] and his mom and all the family that's
[1:18:32] that's preceded him in death
[1:18:34] or sleep
[1:18:36] uh and i know they're having a good time
[1:18:38] up there i know they're they're having a
[1:18:39] better time than we are here
[1:18:42] um
[1:18:44] you know i was thinking i'm like i
[1:18:45] wonder if uh he's watching us you know
[1:18:47] he's watching me or
[1:18:49] kind of hanging out and uh
[1:18:51] he had this bracelet that he'd wear all
[1:18:53] the time and uh
[1:18:55] martha my stepmom gave it to me and it
[1:18:57] means a lot to me it really does it i
[1:18:59] wore it to work
[1:19:00] and i
[1:19:01] kind of felt like he was watching me you
[1:19:03] know kind of hanging out with me at work
[1:19:07] but then i started thinking about it i'm
[1:19:08] like well if i was
[1:19:09] if i was up there with with the lord and
[1:19:12] family i don't think i'd be wasting my
[1:19:13] time looking looking around down here on
[1:19:15] earth but
[1:19:17] uh
[1:19:18] you know i'd be wanting to meet adam and
[1:19:20] moses and
[1:19:21] you know all the noah and all the
[1:19:23] wow that that would be my
[1:19:26] my thing it's going to be my thing
[1:19:28] lord will
[1:19:31] uh
[1:19:33] my dad cherished his family he loved his
[1:19:35] nieces and nephews
[1:19:37] kids grandkids great-grandkids
[1:19:40] he was always happy to see see the kids
[1:19:42] and and
[1:19:44] play with them and make them laugh and
[1:19:46] you know tell jokes to
[1:19:48] them that was that was my dad uh
[1:19:52] he was a good man um
[1:19:55] i wanna
[1:19:57] read a couple of
[1:20:00] scriptures here
[1:20:02] um going to say a quick prayer before
[1:20:05] the reading the word of the lord
[1:20:07] lord may you bless the reading of your
[1:20:08] word here you may touch someone or all
[1:20:11] of us here lord may it comfort us and
[1:20:13] guide us
[1:20:14] please lord protect us in your precious
[1:20:15] holy name bless the reading of your word
[1:20:17] in jesus name amen
[1:20:21] first thessalonians 4 13 through 18
[1:20:26] but we do not want you to be uninformed
[1:20:29] brothers
[1:20:30] about those who are asleep that you may
[1:20:32] not grieve as others
[1:20:35] do who have no hope
[1:20:36] for since we believe that jesus died and
[1:20:39] rose again
[1:20:40] even so through jesus god will bring
[1:20:43] with him those who have fallen asleep
[1:20:46] for this we declare to you to you by the
[1:20:49] word
[1:20:50] from the lord that we who are alive who
[1:20:53] are left until the coming of the lord
[1:20:55] will not perceive those who have fallen
[1:20:57] asleep for the lord himself will descend
[1:20:59] from heaven
[1:21:06] with the cry
[1:21:07] of command
[1:21:09] with the voice of an
[1:21:12] archangel and with the sound of the
[1:21:14] trumpet of god
[1:21:17] and the dead in christ will rise first
[1:21:20] then we who are alive who are left will
[1:21:23] be caught up together with them in the
[1:21:25] clouds to meet the lord in the air and
[1:21:28] so we will always be with the lord
[1:21:31] amen
[1:21:34] this last one
[1:21:36] second corinthians 5 6-8
[1:21:39] so we are always of good courage
[1:21:42] we know that while we are home in the
[1:21:45] body
[1:21:46] we are away from the lord
[1:21:48] for we walk by faith not by sight
[1:21:51] yes we are of good courage and we would
[1:21:54] rather be
[1:21:55] away from the body and at home with the
[1:21:57] lord
[1:22:01] those kind of
[1:22:02] kind of brought me a little bit of
[1:22:03] comfort

[1:31:00] foreign
[1:31:03] [Music]
[1:31:14] moments
[1:31:27] want to just open the scriptures this
[1:31:28] morning and speak a little bit about
[1:31:30] what it is to encounter death and what
[1:31:32] the bible says about that
[1:31:34] in little los almost in psalms 116 15 if
[1:31:38] the brothers would put it up there
[1:31:42] is
[1:31:56] a
[1:32:00] [Music]
[1:32:25] to lose a child is one of the hardest
[1:32:27] things that someone could
[1:32:29] could ever feel
[1:32:31] and it's very very very hard
[1:32:33] i we buried my my daughter passed away
[1:32:36] last year in september
[1:32:38] and my brother in march my only brother
[1:32:52] in spite proverbs 14 32.
[1:32:56] if you can put it up there brothers
[1:33:00] i'll try to tell you before i read it
[1:33:02] the wicked is driven away in this
[1:33:03] wickedness but the righteous
[1:33:06] hath hope and his death
[1:33:20] seniors
[1:33:35] bible you know the world tells us the
[1:33:36] humanistic views that are in the world
[1:33:38] right now in
[1:33:39] secular views that there is no god
[1:33:42] there's no creator there's nothing after
[1:33:43] this life
[1:33:45] but the bible says that the righteous
[1:33:48] have hope in his death
[1:34:44] we're all flesh and bone and he was a
[1:34:46] man named job that in one day lost
[1:34:48] everything his health his children his
[1:34:51] wealth everything his own wife looked at
[1:34:53] him and said why don't you just curse
[1:34:55] die god and die
[1:34:57] with all of that he was in great
[1:35:02] sorrow
[1:35:04] and just being a man
[1:35:06] the mind is just blurred and
[1:35:09] con confused and
[1:35:11] and all this knee and he's and he said
[1:35:14] these words
[1:35:15] palabras job 14 verses 1 and 2.
[1:35:26] s
[1:36:00] that is born of a woman is a few days
[1:36:02] and full of trouble he comes forth like
[1:36:04] a flower
[1:36:05] and is cut down
[1:36:07] he fleeth also as a shadow
[1:36:10] and continue with not that's our life
[1:36:13] we are a lot of maybe 50 60 years 70
[1:36:17] maybe 80
[1:36:18] some might go 90 or 100 but very few
[1:36:21] we know that our time is allotted we
[1:36:24] know that our time is short here on
[1:36:25] earth
[1:36:27] he also said
[1:36:30] in job 14-5
[1:36:51] seeing his days are determined the
[1:36:52] number of his months are with thee
[1:36:55] thou has appointed his bounds
[1:36:58] that he passed not
[1:37:00] our days are appointed the bible says
[1:37:03] that
[1:37:03] that the steps of the righteous are
[1:37:05] ordered by god
[1:37:07] god has set limits
[1:37:09] we don't know that limit
[1:37:11] yo
[1:37:12] limits
[1:37:58] we know that many have come to this
[1:38:00] place and and they laid in a state in a
[1:38:03] coffin such as this right now
[1:38:05] young people
[1:38:07] adolescents older people middle aged
[1:38:10] there's no exception of persons when it
[1:38:12] comes to death
[1:38:15] and we know that the bible says
[1:38:17] there are no god sets the limits in the
[1:38:19] boundaries and we won't cross that day
[1:38:41] is
[1:38:57] where is david we could ask that
[1:38:58] question but man dieth and wastes away
[1:39:01] yay man giveth up the ghosts and where
[1:39:04] is he
[1:39:05] where is where is he
[1:39:08] what we have here are the remains the
[1:39:09] house that david lived in
[1:39:13] you know that soul of man
[1:39:15] which is a real person on the inside
[1:39:17] never gets old
[1:39:20] we get old this body
[1:39:22] this is a corrupted body
[1:39:24] we inherited this from eden
[1:39:27] but you know that that inside
[1:39:29] that inner man
[1:39:31] is
[1:40:05] it's hard to see the death someone we
[1:40:07] love
[1:40:08] and we might be in sorrow this morning
[1:40:10] not and just think what i know i went
[1:40:13] through these things last year
[1:40:19] so
[1:40:23] in job 14 and 14-16
[1:40:28] if man should die
[1:40:31] shall he live again
[1:40:34] what a question to ask
[1:40:37] we we can ask the question why am i here
[1:40:41] why is all this
[1:40:43] was all this an accident
[1:40:46] or is there an intelligence behind all
[1:40:48] of this
[1:41:01] is
[1:41:20] he said all the days of my appointed
[1:41:22] time
[1:41:24] will i wait
[1:41:25] till my change come
[1:41:27] he knew there was a change coming
[1:41:30] we all know there's a change it's an
[1:41:32] appointed time and a change
[1:41:35] that's coming forth for every one of us
[1:41:44] responded
[1:41:48] it says here
[1:41:49] thou shalt call
[1:41:51] and i will answer thee
[1:41:53] he knows your name this morning
[1:41:56] he knows your name
[1:41:58] he knows the sorrow he knows the pain
[1:42:02] he knows the suffering
[1:42:11] is
[1:42:42] he says
[1:42:44] thou shalt call and i will answer thee
[1:42:46] that will have a desire to
[1:42:48] to the work of thine hands
[1:42:51] he formed us he made us
[1:42:52] he will call us
[1:42:54] before him one day
[1:42:56] will stand before him
[1:42:59] for thou for now thou numberst my steps
[1:43:05] not even one step further than what he
[1:43:08] has numbered
[1:43:09] will we take
[1:43:11] does thou
[1:43:13] not watch over my sin
[1:43:16] the all-seeing eye of god
[1:43:21] we have a book of life
[1:43:45] there's a book it's called the book of
[1:43:47] life
[1:43:48] every one of us there is a book written
[1:43:51] and all our deeds
[1:43:54] are written there
[1:43:55] there will be a cut there will come a
[1:43:57] day of of judgment
[1:44:00] the bible says the the judgment was set
[1:44:02] and the books were opened books plural
[1:44:06] the book of your life
[1:44:08] the book of my life
[1:44:14] so the question is this morning
[1:44:18] is
[1:44:23] abraham said he sleepeth
[1:44:26] he's asleep
[1:44:28] because we as christians
[1:44:30] we don't believe we die
[1:44:34] we change a geographical
[1:44:36] position
[1:44:45] our
[1:44:52] john 11 11 through 15.
[1:45:00] jesus
[1:45:08] jesus had a friend his name was lazarus
[1:45:10] and he had gotten sick
[1:45:12] and they sent word to jesus
[1:45:47] you know jesus said
[1:45:49] they had sent word he didn't come and
[1:45:51] lazarus died but jesus knew that
[1:45:54] when he was far away
[1:45:56] and he turned the disciple and he says
[1:45:57] you know
[1:45:58] uh he said uh well here it is the
[1:46:00] scripture right here he says in them our
[1:46:02] friend lazarus sleepeth
[1:46:05] but i go that i may awake him
[1:46:08] out of sleep
[1:46:28] then said his disciples lord if he sleep
[1:46:31] he shall do well next verse
[1:46:34] howbeit jesus spake of his death
[1:46:38] but they thought that he had spoken of
[1:46:40] taking rest in sleep
[1:46:44] entonces
[1:46:48] we had to talk to them in their terms
[1:46:50] he's dead
[1:46:53] in ton says
[1:46:54] uh then jesus said unto them plainly
[1:46:58] lazarus is dead
[1:47:04] versus
[1:47:05] john 11 11 20-27
[1:47:08] anton says
[1:47:12] he came back to
[1:47:13] bethany
[1:47:17] maria marta
[1:47:27] we find that when jesus is coming back
[1:47:29] to bethany that martha saw him walking
[1:47:32] towards bethany and she went ahead to
[1:47:35] meet him
[1:47:36] on the road
[1:47:38] and here we find these scriptures
[1:47:59] she goes to him she says lord if he had
[1:48:00] been here
[1:48:02] my brother lazarus he would not have
[1:48:04] died
[1:48:10] but i know that whatever you ask of god
[1:48:12] god is going to give it to you
[1:48:15] jesus jesus led
[1:48:29] if i would say this morning jesus said
[1:48:30] now lazarus
[1:48:33] shall
[1:48:34] rise again
[1:48:36] he shall rise again if i will say to you
[1:48:38] this morning what would you think
[1:48:40] one day david
[1:48:42] will rise again
[1:48:58] well i know he's to he's going to rise
[1:49:00] again
[1:49:01] he says that be the next verse brother
[1:49:03] 23 probably or
[1:49:10] 25
[1:49:12] yeah see i am the and she says martha
[1:49:15] said unto him i know that he shall rise
[1:49:17] again in the resurrection of the last
[1:49:19] day she puts away over there
[1:49:22] but jesus looks at her
[1:49:25] can you imagine had you been martha
[1:49:27] standing there that day
[1:49:29] your brother laying
[1:49:31] four days
[1:49:33] in a tomb
[1:49:35] after the third day the body begins to
[1:49:37] decay rapidly
[1:49:39] the eyes cave in and and and the inside
[1:49:43] the internal organs everything just
[1:49:45] starts to get eat up
[1:49:48] so it was more than just death
[1:49:51] he was he he was he was corrupted
[1:49:54] it was a fourth day
[1:49:57] i think jesus did it on purpose
[1:50:10] the word god says dust thou art dust
[1:50:12] thou shall return
[1:50:21] jesus
[1:50:51] he looks at her and she says oh
[1:50:53] way over there sometime no says martha
[1:50:55] listen to me
[1:50:57] i am
[1:50:59] the resurrection
[1:51:01] and the life
[1:51:03] amen
[1:51:05] she was looking at the very fountain
[1:51:07] of life standing there
[1:51:13] fuente
[1:51:15] de vida
[1:51:17] paraguay
[1:51:36] [Music]
[1:51:44] believing a religion or a tradition or
[1:51:46] even a church not even this one they're
[1:51:48] just walls
[1:51:51] but believing in him
[1:51:54] believing in jesus christ
[1:52:11] he is the way the truth and the life
[1:52:14] no man cometh unto him unto the father
[1:52:17] but by him
[1:52:26] hallelujah
[1:52:33] he that believeth in me
[1:52:35] though he were dead
[1:52:37] yet shall he live
[1:52:40] amen
[1:52:56] amigo
[1:53:24] shall not die
[1:53:35] he asked her a question he said believe
[1:53:37] is
[1:53:40] i ask you this morning
[1:53:42] do you believe
[1:53:44] do you believe in the resurrection
[1:53:47] i want to cut it short as much as i can
[1:53:49] but
[1:53:50] just let me give you this few minutes
[1:53:52] more the whole world everything around
[1:53:55] us the very nature itself speaks of the
[1:53:58] resurrection
[1:53:59] we just have to open our eyes and look
[1:54:01] around
[1:54:02] you see a tree in the summertime
[1:54:06] bueno verona
[1:54:45] you see that tree there full of life
[1:54:47] those leaves and the birds and and all
[1:54:49] these things and and we see that how
[1:54:51] that that that that the the that it's it
[1:54:54] it's symbolic of a young person
[1:54:56] full of life and young and healthy and
[1:54:59] vibrant and strength and everything
[1:55:02] but you know it doesn't stay that way we
[1:55:04] know that life goes on
[1:55:12] then fall comes
[1:55:14] and the leaves begin to fall off
[1:55:16] hair begins to start turning gray and
[1:55:18] fall out
[1:55:20] the shoulders get stooped
[1:55:22] we start our eyes begin to get dim
[1:55:25] it's called old age
[1:55:28] and in autumn
[1:55:29] we see that
[1:55:31] and then when winter comes
[1:55:42] that life comes winter time
[1:55:45] goes into the roots
[1:55:46] into the ground
[1:55:49] talking of death
[1:55:51] buried in the ground
[1:55:53] is that the end
[1:55:54] of the story
[1:55:56] no
[1:55:58] wait around till spring
[1:56:00] is
[1:56:26] [Music]
[1:56:40] of a life a death
[1:56:43] and then a resurrection
[1:56:45] you see the sun in the morning how it
[1:56:47] rises weak
[1:56:49] in the morning
[1:56:50] in the east memorial
[1:56:52] salir la manana
[1:57:15] and we see that the sun is zenith in the
[1:57:18] middle of the day in the strength
[1:57:20] speaking of a young man a young woman
[1:57:22] full of life and full of energy and
[1:57:25] full of youth
[1:57:27] and health
[1:57:29] but does this remain there no it goes on
[1:57:32] that sun continues to go
[1:57:35] and then it starts to get weak again
[1:57:37] speaking of
[1:57:39] old age
[1:57:40] infirmities and things of that nature
[1:57:43] and then the son
[1:57:47] is
[1:57:59] the sun
[1:58:00] goes down behind the mountains
[1:58:04] and then darkness comes speaking of
[1:58:06] death
[1:58:07] a life being born
[1:58:09] lived
[1:58:10] old age
[1:58:11] dying death
[1:58:13] is that the end of the story
[1:58:15] is
[1:59:17] a certain man in our day a leader a
[1:59:19] religious leader stood up and said that
[1:59:20] the greatest failure
[1:59:23] of god was the cross allowing his son to
[1:59:26] die on the cross he called it a failure
[1:59:28] of god because he doesn't know the
[1:59:30] scriptures
[1:59:32] the cross was the greatest victory
[1:59:35] that was ever won
[1:59:37] for mankind
[1:59:38] because that bee having just one stinger
[1:59:41] he stung his
[1:59:42] his stinger into christ
[1:59:46] and all he is is just a bluff
[1:59:49] because we come to this place right here
[1:59:52] and we just step into another place
[1:59:55] it doesn't stop the christian
[2:00:10] for me to live is christ
[2:00:12] and to die is gain
[2:00:15] this is our victory
[2:00:16] the victory greatest victory ever won
[2:00:19] satan lost the battle
[2:00:23] and we are the victors
[2:00:26] in closing this morning
[2:00:30] i had another scripture i wanted to give
[2:00:31] but brother abraham he gave that
[2:00:33] scripture
[2:00:35] we know paul said behold i show you a
[2:00:37] mystery
[2:00:40] [Music]
[2:00:42] maybe it's still a mystery to us in a
[2:00:44] way
[2:00:45] because we never we have not
[2:00:46] experimented with death
