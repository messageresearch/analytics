in Jesus name amen God bless you all you can take your seats uh I'm excited tonight we have as I said there's we're a few in number tonight but those of us that are here I promise you are going to receive a very special special blessing uh we have a a visitor is it Cedric is that your name God bless you my brother welcome it's good to have you we um tonight we're going to be listening to a taped sermon in this sermon was um from many decades ago in the 1950s and it was from a very special man this man's named William Branham he is the one that started have you heard of the charismatic Revival back in the 50s it gave rise to people like Billy Graham and Oral Roberts and even do today like Benny Hinn and all of them have followed in brother branham's footsteps and this part of this sermon brother Cedric we're going to hear tonight is the supernatural way that this man William Branham got his commission to go forth and um pray for the sick and really it changed the world the Pentecostals and and the denominations that it switched to a healing Revival it was a great move that that spread around the world and tonight we're going to hear for all of us we're going to hear how brother Branham got that commission to pray for the sick now there's a few things that I want to talk about before we get to the sermon and um lay a foundation brother Branham had had very Supernatural things that had followed his whole life when he was born they witnessed a supernatural light come into the room and and hover over him when he was born in this little Log Cabin way back in the hills of Kentucky and he had a special gift that we don't see very often but we do see it in this book especially among the prophets of old we also see it in the in the New Testament we see it among the disciples but this gift is the gift of the Supernatural and it's something that we should be seeing more of today so what happened was brother Branham um he was really upset because he would see visions and he would have these Supernatural experiences and the preachers that he was in his circle of friends would tell him that no those things aren't right those things are evil those things are from the Devil and it as a young man it really it really upset him and and it kept happening in his life and it came to the point in his late 30s that he just couldn't handle it anymore so what he did was he told his wife he said he was working a job for the power company and he said uh he says I'm going up to my place he had a cave up in the mountains north of his hometown in Southern Indiana called Jeffersonville he had about 30 minutes North near the town of Charlestown is a uh a river a creek called 14 Mile Creek and um it uh it's I don't know it's probably as wide as as this building is and it shrinks down fairly fairly small most time of the year and you can just wait across it but he had a cave it's Limestone up there he had a cave that he would go back in there and he would pray and he and the Lord would deal with him there well he had to get away and to get things right and to see are these things from God or are they from the devil like all these preachers are telling me and he was under the impression that these things are from the devil and he wanted to be delivered of them so he went up now there's two different versions of his life story that we tell that that he was either in a cave or he was in a cabin but this tape that we're going to hear tonight answers that question so what happened was brother Branham was on his way up to that cave to pray and he went up there and I think he prayed a little bit and then he came back to the cabin now the distance between the cabin and the cave is probably less than a half a mile they're right next to each other at a place called tunnel Mill so the the really close brother Brandon would pray in the cave so he was staying the night as you'll hear on the tape in this cabin and you're going to hear him tell the story of what happened on that very special night um but I wanted to share a couple testimonies with you of um brother Branham tells a story a couple stories and I actually had the honor of meeting a couple people that were there when brother Branham tells these stories one of the stories was brother Brahm tells that he was baptizing a number of people and there was a young lady that got in a boat and she paddled out to where brother Branham was baptizing people and started making fun of him now this man that I met he was in his 90s and I probably met him about 10 10 years ago or so so and he passed on not too long after I talked with him his name is Robert E Lee I'll never forget his name and and he uh he had many many experiences with brother Branham but in this instance he was telling me this story and he said that he was standing on the bank and there were many people going to baptism brother Branham was out baptizing in the river and this woman young lady she paddles out in a boat and she's showing off in front of her friends and she's heckling brother Branham now brother Branham knew her he called her by name and he said hey you know stop doing it you know and she just kept on and this Robert this young man was watching this whole thing and she's out in her boat brother Branham is baptizing and he kept asking her will you stop it have some respect and she just kept on making fun of him and making fun of the people coming out to be baptized well Robert told me now there's this has got to be the same story I don't know how it could be different Robert um Robert Lee he said that while she was out there that something happened to her and she started losing her mind and she just kept on saying it more and it just it kept getting worse and worse and he knew this woman from before and she just started acting more and more irrationally and watching her out there and and she just kept on and finally she just leaned forward and Robert said he said you know he said I knew her family and he says I never saw her again after that he says he says I think that she died he said within two weeks he says she was she was dead because I never saw her again and her family still lived there but what I don't think he knew was she was actually committed for the rest of her life into an insane asylum and she died there so very very serious thing that happened right there and you're going to hear on the tape so when brother random mentions it remember the story that I told and this is another story that I was out I used to go out and ride my bike around Jeffersonville and I'd talk to old folks and and finally I made my way to this um old black man that had a barbecue restaurant called Marvin's barbecue and it was good did you ever go there buddy ever take you there yeah I took Daniel there it was really really the best barbecue in Jeffersonville but he also had a little convenience store so I had heard that he knew brother random so I started talking with him and uh I said you ever know William Branham he goes oh yeah he says I know him well he said he said back way back in the 40s when he knew him he said that there was segregation and he said blacks and whites did not mix and he said he went to an all-black School and he said brother Branham he'd be walking to school this young man teenager he'd be walking to school and brother Branham would pick him up in his car and Marvin said he said he always had he said he was always shined up he says I got in that thing and I used to feel really good so brother random would take him to school and he said he says that was in the you know the late 40s and he said I never knew he was a preacher he said he was just a down-to-earth guy he said he talked like everybody else he said he he said he didn't talk like other Preachers did he said he talked like us like a normal person he said boy I really liked him he says I knew that he worked for the um the fishing game in conservation and he said he said he was just wow he's just he's just a really great guy and he said then he said he came up missing and he said I didn't see him for months and I thought I wonder whatever happened to that guy Billy Branham and he said then he came back and he said he was famous he said all of a sudden all of these people started coming from all over the world to come to our little town of Jeffersonville to hear Billy Branham and he's not even know he's a preacher and then they were telling me he's a he's a preacher and and he's famous and and all of this healing he said he said I had no idea he said but I knew him he said I knew him before he got famous he said but I don't know what happened when he came up missing and he came back and he was famous and friends the tape that we're going to hear tonight is the answer to that question brother Branham was in the Wilderness Area there in tunnel Mill he was in that little cabin and this supernatural being came to him and gave him his commission to to he to pray for the sick and then you'll notice right afterwards brother Branham went out on the field and he started traveling the country and these great healing revivals they they just started growing and growing until these healing revivals were the biggest religious gatherings that had ever been in the United States when brother Branham was preaching them that's how famous according to Marvin's words brother Branham was when he went out and he was doing these things and that was in the late 1940s just after he got this commission to pray for the sick so very very exciting time and I've told you I've given the testimony how I looked back in the Branham Tabernacle records and I saw from I think they started in 1934 all the way until like 1945 or 46 the offering was like a dollar didn't change much the same amount of people came to church Church wasn't really growing it was you know you could tell that it was a good church it was a solid church but brother Branham like I said um with Marvin he had to work he was he was doing other things and and trying to make a living and then all of a sudden it exploded and it exploded because of this sermon this testimony that we're going to hear tonight very very special so for time's sake we're going to start with paragraph number 30 5 brother Jordan and if we could end on paragraph 214. after after paragraph 214. okay and but I want to encourage everyone to go hear the whole sermon because at the beginning it's basically a life story he talks about what I just talked about when he was born and then at the end of this sermon it is the most amazing thing and I want you to listen to it on your own it's the most amazing thing brother Branham tells the people gives them a hint what's going to happen because he's talking about this Angel and this Angel tells him that you're going to know the very secrets of the people's hearts and then at the end of the sermon brother Branham starts going from person to person you have this wrong with you your name is this you have that wrong with you going from person to person all the way in the back and to the front every different problem that you can imagine and he proves what this angel said was the truth and again for time's sake we're not going to hear the only the whole thing but I want you all to listen to it um January 17 1955 in Chicago at Lane Tech High School I think that was a Monday it was a Monday night that he preached us and it was a start of meetings that he was going to have again we'll start on paragraph 35 and I've already read the scriptures and and brother branham's into the sermon now so I'll sit down and I will turn the service over to brother Branham God bless you and now anyhow at the as a little boy you know the vision had spoke to me is about seven years old and said don't drink or smoke or defile your body in any way there'll be a work for you do when you get older and you've heard that told in the book well that's right all alone he kept happening when I become a minister well then it then it really started happening all the time and uh one night saw our lord Jesus I'm saying this with permission I believe from the Holy Spirit the angel of the Lord it comes is not the Lord Jesus it doesn't look like him in the same time I thought if I could just get him to accept the Lord Jesus I went out laid down a little old palate out in the front room near the door and something said to me rise up and I raised up went walking and went back into the field behind me no broom Sage field they're studying out over 10 feet from me stood a man white garment on little fella had his arms folded like this a Beard's kind of sharp hair down to his shoulders and he's looking Sideways from me like that peaceful looking figure but I couldn't understand how his feet weren't just behind the other and the wind blowing his Road moving Sage blowing I thought now wait a minute I bit myself I said now I'm not asleep and I pull down pull a little piece of that Sage off you've got it like a toothpick in it I put it in my mouth I looked back towards the house I said no I was in there praying for Dad something said come out here and here stands this man I thought that looks like the Lord Jesus I thought I wonder if it is and he's looking just exactly directly towards where our house sets now so I moved around this way to see if I could see him and ever moved him I thought I'd leave our calling I said Jesus and when he did he looked around like that as all I remember he just reached out his arms there's not an artist in the world could paint his picture the characters of his face the best I've ever seen is that Hoffman's head of Christ at 33 I've got it on all literature and everything I use that's it because that looks just like it and so then or Premier as low close as it could be he looked like a man if he'd speak the world would come to an end and yet there's so much love and kindness to you I just pitched over in a daylight I found myself just to break a day pajama shirts soaking wet with tears when I come to myself walking back to the broomstage feel home I told it to a minister friend of mine he said Billy that'll run you crazy he said that's the devil and said don't you fool with nothing like that I was a Baptist minister at the time well I went over to another old friend of mine I sat down and told him about it and I said uh brother what do you think about that he said well Billy I'll tell you he said I believe if you'd try to keep your life just preach what's in the Bible hear the grace of God and so forth I wouldn't go off after some fantastic thing something like that I said sir I don't mean to go off after some fantastic thing I said only thing I'm trying to find out is what this is he said Billy years ago they used to have those things in the churches but said when the apostles ceased those things ceased with it and said now the only thing that we have in any kind of seeing those things said it's spiritualist demons House of old brother McKinney you mean that he said yes sir I said a whole God have mercy on me I said ah ah old Brunswick will you join with me in prayer that God will never let it happen to you know I love him and I don't want to be wrong in these things I said You Prayed with me he said I will brother Billy and so we had prayer right there in them in the parsleys I asked several ministers the same thing would come then I got scared to ask him because he'd be thinking I was the devil so I I didn't want to be like that I noted my heart something happened now that's all there there's something in my heart that happened and I didn't want to be like that never so later on in years I heard one day down at the First Baptist Church where I was a member at the time I heard someone saying say you are to one over and heard them Holy Rollers last time and I thought holy Rose and a friend of mine Walt Johnson bass singer and I said what was that brother wall he said a bunch of these Pentecostals I said what he said Pentecostals said Billy if you'd ever see that said they was rolling on the floor like that and jumping up and down and said they said that they had to jabber off in some kind of unknown tongues or they wasn't saved and I said where's that at all says little old tent meeting out there the other side of Louisville said colored people of course and I said and he said there's a lot of white people there I said did they do that too said yes yes and I said that's funny as people get mixed up and stuff like that I said well I guess we just have to have those things on a Sunday morning I never forget if he's eating a piece of dry orange peeling for indigestion he had and I just sit as well as it was yesterday and I thought jabarding jumping up and down what kind of religions will they get next and so I I went on later from that I met an old man it's here in a church maybe now or he was here or to church the name of John Ryan and I met him at a place old fellow long beard and hair and um and he may be here I thought he's from the Benton Harbor up here at the house of David and um they had a place in Louisville ice trying to find them people they called it the school of the prophets so I thought I'd go over to see what that was well I didn't see nobody rolling on the floor but they had some strange doctrines and that's where I met this old man he invited me came up to his place I went up for a vacation I was there one day and I went back to his house and he's done gone and he'd gone somewhere down in Indianapolis said the Lord called in his wife I said you mean you let that man run off like that she said oh he's God's servant poor old thing died a few weeks ago I heard him and she's devoted to him my that's kind of wife to have him that's right right or wrong he's right anyhow I said well I know the now he brother iron are you here um he isn't here he was another day wasn't he boys well they just live with what they get a hold of it he didn't have nothing to eat in the house that's right and I caught some fish out to a pond or a lake in Michigan I come back down and I come back down to the place and they didn't even have lard in the house or grease to cook the fish with and I said he let you without anything in the house so but he's God's servant brother Bill said he I thought well bless your old heart run I'll stand right by you that's right do you think that much your husband I'm ready to jar up and stand by you for that that's right we need more women like that today and more men thinking of their wife like that that's right you'd be a better America if husbands and wives are joined together like that right or wrong stay with them we'll be so many divorces so we we went to then I went on and Omar wrote home is a strange thing I come down to Mishawaka and I've seen little little old cars now sitting on the street called big signs on them said Jesus only I thought what Jesus on that must be religious I went over here and his bicycles had on it Jesus only Cadillacs Model T Fords Everything Jesus only on it I thought I wonder what that is so I followed it around come to find out it was a religious meeting 1500 2 000 people there and I heard all that they're screaming and jumping up and down and going on I thought say here's where I'll see what holy earlers is so I am Old Forge you know what I claim would make 30 miles an hour 15 this way 15 up down this way so I'm pulling over to one side I got a place to park walk back down the street walked in looked around and everybody's standing it could stand I had to look over their heads and they were screaming and jumping and falling and carrying on I thought what a people that is but the longer I stood there better I felt that seems pretty good oh there ain't nothing wrong van people they ain't crazy I got talking to some of them so they they were fine people so I said well now that's the same meeting I went out and stayed all night that night and the next day I went in and you've heard me tell that my life story and I was on the platform as 150 or 200 ministers maybe more and they want everybody to raise up and stay where they was from and I said evangelist William Branham Jeffersonville sit down Baptist so sit down each one tell where they were from so um that next morning when I got in there I was slept in the field all night that night and pressed my trousers between the two Ford seat snow and I I old Searsucker trousers little t-shirts you know so the next morning on went to the meeting my little t-shirt on I went I didn't have a three dollars I had to get enough gas to get home on and I got you some rolls it's kind of old you know but I was already I got to the Hydra got me a glass of water you know and they were pretty good so I soaked them up a little I had breakfast I could eat with them now they ate twice a day but I couldn't put nothing in the offering so I wouldn't sponge on them so then I'm and I I got in there that morning and said I just have to tell this part of it so got in there that morning and he said we're looking for William Branham a young evangelist was on the platform he's not a Baptist so we wanted to bring the message this morning I seen this gonna pull me hard that bunch of people me a Badness so I just kind of scooted down in the seat I had on seersucker trousers a t-shirt you know and we wore clerical so when I stepped back to the seat like this so he asked two or three times and I sat down by a colored brother and the reason they had their convention in the north because of segregation was then on in the South so they couldn't have it in the south so I wonder what this Jesus only was about now those lungs is Jesus it's all right so don't make any difference whether it's how it is just as long as it's him so I sat there a little bit and watched him and so they called two or three times more and this color brother looked over me said do you know him putting more lie to the man I didn't want to I said look brother yes I know him he said well go get him I said well I'll tell you brother I said I am he but you see I said look I these seersucker trousers get all that there and I said no I can't go up there I said but these trousers on I guess this little t-shirts and damn people don't care how you dressed and I said well look don't you mention it here I said see I so the next morning when the Lord had given me this great opportunity to hold these meetings I thought oh my I'll get with this bunch of people that must be the kind of what they used to call the shouting Methodist just went a little farther I thought maybe that's what it is so I well I'm I sure like that oh there's something about in my life they're humble and sweet so one thing I couldn't understand was that speaking in tongues that got me and I this one man say sitting here and one over here and they were the leaders of the group this would raise up and speak in tongues this would interpret it and would tell things about the meeting and so forth oh my sure I got to read that so then it vice versa follow on this and then back on that one and each one Speaking tongues interpret the rest of the church would speak but it didn't seem like the interpretation come like these two men now I've seen this sit close together I thought oh myland must be angels so while sitting back there ever what that was you know what I couldn't make out it would come on me and I have a way of knowing things if the Lord wants me to know it and I don't I Serena say I don't breathe this out never before in public but if I really want to find out anything the Lord usually tells me about these things that's what the gift is foreign so you can't just throw that out before the people it becomes like cast your pearls before swines it's a sacred holy thing and you don't want to do that so God will hold me responsible like talking to Brethren and so forth I wouldn't try to find out something evil about a brother one time sitting at a table with the man him with his arm around me said oh brother Branham I love you and I kept feeling something moving I looked at him he couldn't have told me that I know he didn't do it see well there it was he was absolutely a hypocrite if he ever was one see and right there this arm around me I said well okay walked away I don't want to know that I'd rather just know him the way I know him as my brother Let It Go like that let God do the rest of it see and I don't want to don't want to know those things and many times on these things it's not here in a church I'll be sitting in the room setting a restaurant and the Holy Spirit will tell me things that's going to happen people's right ears knows that to be true I'll sit at my home and I'll say now be careful there's a car coming after all be a certain certain person bring them on in for the Lord has said they'd be here when we go down the street there'll be certain things happen watch that Crossing there because you're going to almost get hit and just sit me that way you see every time just perfectly so you don't want to throw yourself too much into that because you can use it it's a gift of God but you have to watch what you do with it God will hold your response look at Moses Moses was a God sent man do you believe that predestinated for ordained and made a prophet and God sent him out there said go speak to the Rock after Don been smitten say go speak to the rotten to bring forth his Waters but Moses angry right out there struck the rock the water didn't come he smoked it again said you rebels must we bring you water out of this rock you see what God did the water come they come up here Moses that was the end of it see you have to watch those things so you what you do with Divine gifts is like a preacher a good forceful preacher and get out and preach just to take up offerings and money God will hold him responsible for that right you have to watch what you do with Divine gifts and or try to make some big Prestage a big name for some church or a big name for himself I'd rather have two or three nights meeting in braze on somewhere else and be humble and stay down and you know what I mean yes sir always keep your place where God can put his hand on you this is inside life now remember so then this day I thought well I'm going to walk up and I just sold alarm with those people I thought I'll find out about those man and out in the yard I kept looking for him after the service is over I looked around and found one of them I said howdy do sir he said how'd he do said was you the young preacher preached this morning I was 23 years old and I said yes sir and he said uh what was your name I said Brandon I said yours and he told me his name and I thought well now if I can just get his contact of his Spirit now and uh yet not knowing what that was doing it and I said well um say sir I said you people have something here that I don't have he said have you got the Holy Ghost since you believe I said well I'm a Baptist he said but have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe and I said well brother what do you mean I said I haven't got what you all got I know that I said because you've got something that seems to be powerful and so have you ever spoke with tongues and I said no sir I said I'll tell you right quick you haven't got the Holy Ghost and I said well if I if that's what it takes to get the Holy Ghost I haven't got it and so he said well if you haven't spoke with tongues you haven't got it and keeping this conversation I said well can I get it I said get on in the room there and start seeking the Holy Ghost now I kept watching you know he didn't know what I was doing but he I knew he had a little strange feeling because he his eyes begin to get little glasses he looked at me and he but he was really a Christian he was absolutely wrung out 100 a Christian that's right well I thought praise God here it is I've got to get to that altar somewhere I went out looked all around thought I'd find the other man and when I found him and started talking to him I said how'd he do sir he said say what church you belong to said they tell me you're a Baptist I said yep and he said you ain't got Holy Ghost here have you I said well I don't know so you ever spoke in tongues I said no sir said you haven't got it and I said well I know I haven't got what you all got I know that I said but my brother I'm really wanting it he said well there's there's the pool already I said I've been baptized but I said I I haven't received what you all got I said you got something and I I really want and he said uh well that's fine I was trying to catch him to see and if I when I finally got his Spirit now that was the other man if I ever talk to a low down hypocrite there was one of them he was living his wife was a black-headed woman he is living with a blonde and had two children by her drink cursed run to taverns and everything else and yet in there and speaking in tongues and prophesying then I said Lord forgive me I went home that's right I said I'll just get I can't understand it seemed like the Blessed Holy Spirit falling in on that hypocrite I said can't be that's all during this long pure Demi studying and crying thought if I could get out the Bible or it's not right it has to come from here is to be proved in the Bible not just one place but it has to come all the way through the Bible I have to believe it has to dovetail and tie together with every scripture or I don't believe it and then because Paul said if an angel from Heaven Come preach any other gospel let him be accursed so I believe the Bible now I said I could never see nothing like that in the Bible two years later after I lost my wife and everything I was up there to Greens Mill my little old place up there praying been back in my cave back there for two or three days two days at well I walked out to get a bit of a breath of air and when I walked out there my Bible is laying out there on the end of a log just as you come in an old tree blow down had a fork in it now you had four clean up like this the tree laying down and I just set straddle that log and lay out there at night time looking up towards the skies like at my hand laying up like this and sometimes go to sleep laying around on the log like that brain be up there several days just don't eat or drink it's their praying and I walked out to get a little fresh out all that cave is cool damped back in there so then uh come out and there leave my Bible where it had it the day before and it was turned to Hebrews the sixth chapter and I begin to read there let us lay aside on go on to Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance and dead words and Faith towards God and so forth for it is impossible for those which were once enlightened made partakers of the Heavenly gifts callings and so forth but said but thorns and thistles which is not unto rejection who's in the water the rain cometh off upon the Earth to dress it and prepare for that which is that which is not into a rejection with thorns and thistles whose end is to be burned and something like [Music] oh here it is oh here now whatever he he won't be up here he's fixing to give me a vision right now I waited around into that log and waited I cut up walked back and forth up and down walked back nothing happened walked back to my cave again nothing happened I stood there well what is this I walked over to my Bible again and oh it just come all over me again I picked it up and I thought what's in there he wants me to read I kept reading on down about uh repentance towards God and faith and so forth and I read on downward said the rain cometh off upon the Earth to dress it and prepare it for what's meant for for here but the uh thorns and thistles which is not into rejection whose end is to be burned and or just shake me I thought Lord are you going to give me a vision of what I was up there asking for something another that all at once before me I seen the world are rolling there's all disc it up and here one a man with white with his head up a sowing seeds like this and when he went coming this is he went over the hill here come a man behind him dressed in black with his head down a sowing seeds and when the good seeds come up it was sweet and when the bad seeds come up it was Weeds and then become a great drought on the earth and the wheat had its head hanging over just about Paris wanting water I've seen all the people with their hands up praying for God to send water and then I've seen the weed it had its head down Bound for water and just then the great clouds come across and the rain just gushed down and when it did the little wheat that's all been overwined stood right up and the little weed right but siren did right up I thought well what's that then they come to me there it is the same rain that makes the wheat to grow makes the weed to grow and the same Holy Spirit can fall in a bunch of people and can bless the hypocrite just the same as it blesses the others Jesus said buy their fruits you shall know them not whether he shouts whether he rejoices but it's by his fruit you shall know him I said there you are I got it Lord I said then that really is the truth this man you could have gifts without knowing god so then I then I was getting too critical on speaking with tongues you see one day then how God have indicated that to me I was baptizing down on the river my first converts at the Ohio River and the 17th person I was baptizing as a star to baptize them I said fathers I baptized him as water you baptized him with the Holy Spirit I started the put him out of the water just then a whirl come from the heavens above and here come that light shining down hundreds and hundreds of people on the bank right at two o'clock in the afternoon in June and hung right over where was that a voice spoke from there and said as John the Baptist was sent for the Forerunner of the first coming of Christ you gotta have a message that will bring forth the forerunning of the second coming of Christ and it like scared me to death and I went back and all the people there the the foundrymen and all them the drug us and all them on the bank at baptized by two or three hundred that afternoon and when they taken me out pull me out of the water the deacons and so forth went up they asked me said what did that lightning a big group of colored people from the uh the Gilded Age Baptist Church and and the Lone Star Church down there and many of those down there they begin screaming when they saw that happen people fainted a girl I tried to get out of a boat they're sitting there with a swimming suit on a Sunday school teacher in a church and I said won't you get out Margie she said Billy I don't have to get out I said that's right you don't have to but I'd have enough respects for the gospel to get out where I'm baptized he said I don't have to and when that she sat there snickered and laughed at me baptizing of course she didn't believe in baptizing so then when the angel of the Lord come down she pitched forward in the boat the day the girls in the insane Institution so you just can't play with God now later on a beautiful girl went to drinking later on was hit with a bottle of beer bottle cut all over her face down all a horrible looking person and there that happened and then all along down through life I'd see that see that moving see that Visions how those things would happen then a little later on it kept bothering me so much and everybody tell me it was wrong and I took off to my old stamping grounds up there were always prayed through and I no matter how much I keep praying for that not to come to me it come anyhow and so I was just I was I was game wardened in the state of Indiana and I come in there was a man sitting there a brother to my pianist at the Tabernacle and he said Billy will you ride up to Madison with me this afternoon I said I can't do it I got to go up to the forestry and I'd um just coming around the house and taking off my belt gun belt and things and rolling up my sleeves we live in a little two-room house and I was going to wash and make ready for my meal and I'd washed and just walking around the side of the house under a a big maple tree and all at once up went and it just almost passed out and I looked and I knowed it was that again I sat on those steps and he jumped out of his car and run to me said Billy are you fainting I said no sir he said what's the matter Billy and I said I don't know I said just go ahead brother that's all right thank you my wife come out brought a picture of water she said honey what's the matter I said nothing sweetheart so she said come on now dinner's ready she's put her arm around me trying to bring in I said uh honey I I want to tell you something I said you call him up and tell him I won't be out there this afternoon I said meaty sweetheart I said I know in my heart I love Jesus Christ I know that I've passed some death unto life but I don't want the devil having anything to do with me and I said I can't go on like this I'm a prisoner I said all the time when this thing keeps happening and things like that and these Visions are coming in and so forth like that or whatever it is I said it happens to me I didn't know it was a vision I didn't call it a vision but I said them trance is like I said I don't know what that is and honey I I I don't want to fool with it they tell me it's the devil and I love the Lord Jesus or she said Billy you aren't listening to what people tell you I said but I honey look at other preachers I said I I don't want it I said I'm going to my place in the woods I got about 15 you take care of Billy Billy's little bitty boy then little bitty fella I said you you take cats enough for you and Billy to live on a while call them up tell them I'll I'll may be back tomorrow I may not never be back if I ain't back in the next five days put a man on in my place now I said meeting I'll never come out of that Woods until God promises me he'll take that thing away from me and never let it happen again think of the ignorance that a man can be thy went up there that night went back into the low cabin for his next day it was kind of late I was going to go up to my Camp the next day up on the farther around the mountain or the hill rather and get up in the woods there I don't believe the FBI could find me up there so this is a little cabin I've been praying all that afternoon and before it got too dark I prayed was reading over there in a Bible where it said the spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophet I couldn't make that out so it got too dark in the little cabin where I used to trap when I was a boy I had a trap line through there and go up there and fish and stay all night to the little dilapidated cabin something or whatever been in there for years some tenant might have had it before it all come to that and so I I was just waiting there and I thought well got along towards one o'clock two o'clock three o'clock in the morning I was walking up down the floor walking back and forth I sat down a little still there a little not stool a little box of a thing I sit down there and I thought oh God why do you do this to me I said father you know I love you you know that I love you and I I don't want to be possessed with the Devil I don't want them things to happen to me please God don't never let it happen no more I said I I love you I don't want to go to hell what's the use of me preaching and trying and put my efforts forth if I'm wrong I'm not only taking myself to hell I'm misleading thousands of others or hundreds of others in them days and I said I had a big Ministry and I said well I I don't never want to happen to me again I sit down on this little steel and I'm just setting all kind of disposition just like that and all at once I've seen a light thickering room I thought somebody was coming up with a flashlight and I looked around and I thought well and here it was right out in front of me an old wooden boards on the floor and there it was right in front of me there's a little old drum stole sitting in the corner the top was tore out of it and and right in here there was a a light on the floor and I thought well where is that well that couldn't be coming I looked around and here it was above me this very same light right there above me hanging right like that circling around like a fire is kind of an emerald color going I got just above it okay and I look at that and I'll go what is that now it scared me I heard somebody come in just walking oh it's barefooted and I seen the foot of a man come in dark in the room all but right here we're shining right down I've seen a foot of a man coming in and when he come in to the room walked on up is the man about to Look Away about 200 pounds he had his hands folded like this now I've seen it in a whirlwind I'd heard it talk to me and seen it in a form of a light but the first time I ever seen the image of it it walked up to me real close all our honest friend I thought my heart would fail me I just imagine put yourself there it'd make you feel the same way you're maybe farther along the road than I am they've been a Christian longer but it would make you feel that way cause after hundreds and hundreds of times of visitation it paralyzes me when he comes near sometimes it even makes me up almost completely pass out just so weak and I'll leave the platform many times if I stay too long I'll go completely out I've had them ride me around for hours not even know where I was at now I can't explain it read down here in the Bible and it'll explain it what it is the scripture says so so our Center and they're looking at him I can't let my hand up like that he's looking right at me just as pleasant but he had a real deep voice and he said do not fear I am sent from the presence of almighty God and when he spoke that voice that was the same voice that spoke to me when I was two years old all the way up I know that was him and I thought now and here now listen to the conversation I'll quote it the best that I can knowingly word by word because I hardly remember and he I said looked at him like that he said do not fear this is quite said I'm sent from the presence of almighty God to tell you that your peculiar birth as you know what my birth was up there that same light hung over me when I was first born and so I said the your peculiar birth and misunderstood life has been to indicate that you're to go to all the world and pray for the sick people it said and regardless of what they have and he designated God who's my judge knows that he designated cancer said enough if you get the people to believe you and be sincere when you pray nothing shall stand before your prayer not even cancer thank you if you get the people to believe you and I've seen you wasn't my enemy he was my friend I didn't know where you where I was dying or what was happening when he's coming up to me like that and I said well sir I said I am what I know about healings and things like that those gifts I said well sir I am a I'm a poor man and I said I'm among my people I I live with my people who's poor I'm uneducated and I said and uh I I would not be able they're not they're not understand me I said they they wouldn't um they wouldn't hear me and he said as the prophet Moses was given two gifts signs rather to have Vindicated his ministry so will you've given to so are you given two gifts to vindicate your ministry he said one of them will be that you'll take the person that you're praying for by the hand with your left hand and their right and said then just stand quiet and it'll be a physical effect that'll happen on your body and said then you pray and if it leaves the disease is gone from the people if it doesn't leave just ask the blessing and walk away well I said sir I'm afraid they won't receive me he said and the next thing will be if they won't hear that then they will hear this said then it will come to pass that you'll know the very secret of their heart said this they will hear well I said sir that's why I'm here tonight I have been told by my clergyman that those things has been coming to me was wrong he said you were born in this world for that purpose see gifts and calling without repentance he said you were born in this world for that purpose and I said well sir I said that my curcumen told me it it was the the evil spirit and I said they uh that's why I'm here praying and here's what he quoted to me he related to me the coming of the Lord Jesus in his first time and I said the strange thing was friends well I'll stop right here just for a minute go back what made me more scared than ever every time I met a fortune teller they would recognize something had happened and that would just nearly kill me pray this is one day my cousins and I was going down to a carnival grounds we just boys walk along so there's a little fortune teller sitting out there in one of those tents a young lady nice looking young lady she's still there boys all gone walking by she said say you come here a minute and the three of us boys turned around and she said you were the striped sweater that was me I said yes ma'am I thought she maybe want me to go get her a Coke or something you're like okay and she was a a young woman maybe in her early 20s or something sitting there and I woke up I said yes ma'am what could I do for you and she said did you know there's a a light that follows you you were born under a certain sign I said what do you mean he said well you were born under a certain sign there's a light that follows you you were born for a Divine call I said get away in here woman I started moving on because my mother always told me them things was the devil she was right so that scared me one day while I was a game warden I was going up on the bus and I got on the bus has always seemed to be subject to Spirit I was staying there in the Sailor standing behind me and I was going up to patrol I was going to Henryville forestry and he's on the bus I kept feeling some strange something I looked around there and there's a great big heavy set woman singer nicely dressed she said how'd he do so how to do I thought it was just a woman you know talking so I stopped She said I'd like to talk to you a minute I said yes ma'am I turned around she said um did you know you were born under a sign I highlight another one of them funny women so I just looked on out so I never said a word just kept she said could I speak to you a minute I just kept she said don't act like that I just kept looking forward I thought that isn't gentleman night she said I'd like to speak to you just a moment I just kept looking forward and I wouldn't pay attention to her directly I thought I believe I'll see if she says like the rest of them I turned around I thought oh my that quiver me I know because I hated to think that turned around she said maybe I better explain myself she said I'm an astrologist I said I thought you were something like that she said I'm on my way to Chicago to see my boy who's a Baptist minister I said yes ma'am see did anybody ever tell you you were born under a sign and I said no ma'am and I lied to her there see and I said I just want to see what she's going to say and she said I said no ma'am and she said um Dustin hasn't ministers ever told you I said I don't have nothing to do with ministers and she said um and um I said she she said to me I said well she said if I'll tell you just exactly when you was born will you believe me I said no ma'am and she said well I can tell you when you were born I said I don't believe it and she said you were born on April the 6th 1909 at five o'clock in the morning I said that's right I said how do you know that I said tell Miss sailor here when he was born said I can't and I said why how you know I said look sir she said when she began to talk about the astronomy now and she said ever so many years said You Remember When The Morning Star come it led the wise man to Jesus Christ and I kind of stolen you know I said well I don't know about religion and she said well you've heard about the wise man coming to see Jesus I said yes and she said well what was wise man oh I said it was just wise man all I know she said well what is a wise man she said the same thing that I am an astrologist Stargazer they call him and she said you know if before God does anything in in the earth he always declares in the heavens and then on the earth and I said I don't know and she said well she called two or three two three stars like Mars Jupiter and Venus it wasn't them but she said they crossed their path and come together and made said there was three wise men that come to meet the Lord Jesus and one was from the lineage of ham and one sham another japheth and said when they met together at Bethlehem the three stars that they were from every person on Earth said it has something to do with the Stars said ask that sailor there when the moon goes out and the Heavenly Planet goes out this tide doesn't go with it coming out said I don't have to ask him that I know that and she said well your birth has something to do with the Stars up there and I said well that I don't know and she said now these three wise men came and said when they ate three stars when they they come from different directions and they met at Bethlehem and they said they found out and consulted one versus the lineage of ham Shem and Jeff is the three sons of Noah and she said then they come and worship the Lord Jesus Christ and said when they departed said they brought gifts and put to him and said Jesus Christ said in his ministry that when this gospel has been preached to all the world ham Shem and Jeff is people then he would come again and she said now those planets Heavenly planets as they move around so they separated they've never been on the earth since no one but said ever so many hundred years they cross their Cycles like this if they have to be astronomer here you might know what she thought about I don't so when she talked it said they crossed like that and said in commemoration of the greatest gift that was ever given to mankind when God gave his son when these planets cross themselves again well I said he sends another gift to the Earth and said you were born on the crossing at that time and I said that's the reason I knew it eventually I said lady the first place I don't believe anything about it I'm not religious and I don't want to hear no more about it walked away and so I cut her off pretty sharp so I went on out and every time I get around one of them that's the way it would be and I thought why does them Devils do that then the preacher's saying that's the devil that's the devil they had me believe in it and then that night up there when I when he referred to that I asked him I said well why is it all them mediums and things like that and then devil possess people that always tell me about it and the clergy that my brother and tell me that it's of the evil spirit now listen to what he said this one who's hanging over there in the picture he said as it was then so is it now and he began to refer to me that when the ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ begin to take place the ministers said he was the elves above the devil but the Devils said he was the Son of God the Holy One of Israel devils and look at Paul and Barnabas when he's up there preaching the minister said these men turned the world upside down they were evil they're they're the devil and a little old fortune teller out on the street recognize that Paul and barnes's man of God said they're a man of God who tell us the way of life is that right yeah spiritualists and soothsayers demon-possessed people but we get so soured down on theology so we don't know nothing about the spirit I hope you love me after this but that's what it is I mean Pentecost too that's right just shouting and dancing around doesn't mean you know anything about the spirit it's personal contact face to face that's what you need that's the kind of church God speaks in the raise up that's right when they come together in unit in power spirit and he referred to that and he told me how that the ministry misunderstood it and assured me that the ministry had misunderstood it and when he told me all about this and how did Jesus I said well what about this these things that happened to me he sees that'll multiply and get greater and greater and he referred to me tell me how Jesus did it how did he come and he was possessed with the power that could foreign old things and tell the women at the well claim not to be a Healer claim to do those things just as the father showed him I said well what kind of spirit would that be said it was the Holy Spirit there's something there happened inside of me that I realized that the very thing that I turned my back on was what God brought me here for and I realized that it was just like those Pharisees and the days gone by they had misinterpreted the scripture to me so from then on I took my own interpretation of it what the holy spirit said I told him I'd go he said I'll be with you and the angel stepped into the light again they'll begin to come around around and around around his feet like that went up into the light and went out of the building I went home a new person walked over to the church and told people about it the on Sunday night and on the Wednesday night they brought a woman there one of males nurses dying with cancer nothing but a shadow want to walk down to take a hold of her there come a vision before shoulder back nursing again and she's on the list in Louisville been dead for years there she is a Jefferson Bill now nursing been nursing for years before I looked up there and I've seen that Vision I turned around hardly known what I was doing stand there I quivered when they first brought that case and laid it down there and the nurses and things stand around and her laying there in her face all sunk in her eyes way back Margie Morgan if you want to ride to her that's 411 canobolo Avenue Jeffersonville Indiana all right Clark County Hospital Jeffersonville here let her give you the testimony when I look down there and they're not first case there to see here come out there come a vision I've seen that woman nursing again walking around good and strong and healthy I said thus sayeth the Lord you'll live and not die her husband a very high man and this world sings looked at me like that I said sir don't you fear your wife will live you called me outside said call to the re doctor said you know him I said yes why should I play golf with him he said the cancer had wrapped around her intestines you can't even wash her out with the enema I said I don't care what she's got something down in here I see the vision that man that told me said whatever I seem to say it then it would be so and he's told me and I believe it freeze not a few days and then she's doing her washing going around she weighs about 165 pounds down perfect health then when I accept it away it went then Robert Doherty called me and here it went out down to Texas across the world and one night on about four or five times out I couldn't understand uh speaking in tongues and so forth I believed in the baptism of the Holy Spirit believe that people could speak in tongues one night when I was walking out onto the in a cathedral San Antonio Texas walking out there a little fella setting up here beginning to speak in tongues like a shotgun firing or a machine gun rapidly way back way back there fellow raise up and said thus saith the Lord the man is walking to the platform is going forward with a Ministry that was ordained of almighty God and if John the Baptist was sent as a first Forerunner of the coming of Jesus Christ so he packs a message that'll cause a second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ I like this sunk in my shoes I looked up I said do you know that man he said no sir I said you know him he said no sir I said do you know me he said no sir I said what are you doing here I said I read in the paper and this is as the first night of the meeting I looked over there and I said how'd you come here said some of my people told me that she was going to be here a Divine healer and I come I said don't you all know one another he said no there are scenes that the very power of the holy spirit for one time back there I thought it was wrong and I know that I was this same angel of God was associated with them people that had those things although they had frowning a lot of mix up and a lot of dampling in it but in there was a genuine article brother Billy told me that after these meetings brother Billy Paul is brother Branham the one that was speaking his son he used to drive him around after the meetings and he like brother Branham says in this um in this tape and he says brother Branham would be still praying for the people in the car still still asking the Lord for mercy and praying for them and then he said when he'd come to but the Billy told me he said usually he'd say Billy did the people get healed did the people get blessed so he was concerned with the people I got to uh I gotta play just a little bit of this in part I'm going um my phone here brother Jordan would you be able to start at paragraph 288 would you be able okay so this is when the prayer line starts
