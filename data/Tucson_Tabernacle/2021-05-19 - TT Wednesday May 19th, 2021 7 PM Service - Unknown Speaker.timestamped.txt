[52:12] may it just leave us in that presence of
[52:14] the holy spirit we ask
[52:16] in the name of jesus christ amen
[52:20] praise the lord hebrews chapter 3
[52:22] starting with verse 1
[52:25] the bible says wherefore holy brethren
[52:28] partakers of the heavenly calling
[52:30] consider the apostle and high priest of
[52:34] our profession
[52:35] christ jesus consider the apostle and
[52:39] high priest of our profession christ
[52:41] jesus i just want to take three words of
[52:44] that
[52:45] consider christ jesus consider christ
[52:48] jesus
[52:48] may god bless you you can be seated i
[52:51] just want to take this little thought
[52:52] tonight that we could study god's word
[52:54] don't you love the word of god
[52:56] amen i love the word of god there's
[52:57] something about god's word it makes you
[52:59] strong
[53:00] amen when you hear the word of god it it
[53:02] lifts you up and i love that
[53:04] what the prophet of god said he said
[53:06] man's faith
[53:07] should not rest on the shifting sands of
[53:10] man's theology
[53:11] but rest and have faith in the word of
[53:13] god so what we believe should come from
[53:15] the word of god i've
[53:17] we sing a little song i've anchored in
[53:18] jesus
[53:20] amen i've anchored in jesus the storms
[53:22] of life out brave
[53:24] i was thinking of the scripture over
[53:25] there in peter it says the scriptures
[53:27] which are
[53:28] able to to save you amen you've believed
[53:31] the holy scripture i think paul told
[53:32] timothy
[53:33] they're able to make you wise and to
[53:35] salvation it comes from the scriptures
[53:37] amen that our faith is in the scriptures
[53:40] in the word of god and
[53:41] as i was reading this scripture i i was
[53:43] thinking about this hebrews chapter 3
[53:45] but i want to go back to chapter 2
[53:47] amen because what we know about god
[53:50] should come from the bible
[53:52] so many people they have experiences and
[53:54] and you know those things i appreciate
[53:56] those but brother and he taught us so
[53:57] many things i thank god for this message
[53:59] i love this message it came from jesus
[54:02] christ
[54:03] amen and the prophet of god amen tells
[54:06] us that we should anchor our faith in
[54:08] the word of god
[54:09] verse number 9 of chapter 2 hebrews
[54:11] chapter 2 verse
[54:12] number 9. he said but we see jesus who
[54:15] was made a little lower than the angels
[54:18] for the suffering of death crowned with
[54:21] glory and honor that he by the grace of
[54:23] god
[54:24] should taste death for every man
[54:27] every man god tasted death for every man
[54:30] john said behold the lamb of god that
[54:31] takes away the sin of the whole world
[54:34] god doesn't judge the world because they
[54:36] were sinners
[54:37] all of us were born and sinned shaped in
[54:39] iniquity now the world is covered
[54:42] with a how could we say a bumper of
[54:44] blood and
[54:45] and the wrath of god the great eternal
[54:48] god one
[54:49] evil thing in his presence would god
[54:51] would just annihilate but
[54:52] he looks and sees the earth through the
[54:54] blood of jesus christ aren't you
[54:55] thankful for that
[54:56] aren't you glad he sees you through the
[54:58] blood of jesus christ
[54:59] amen but one day that blood will be
[55:01] lifted and then he that is filthy let
[55:03] him be filthy still
[55:04] him that is holy let him be holy still
[55:06] and then men will be judged because god
[55:08] provided
[55:09] a propitiation to take away their sins
[55:11] but men chose to stay in their sins
[55:14] and then god judges them for that how's
[55:16] a has a little saying some men sins go
[55:19] before
[55:20] and some men sins come after i want to
[55:22] send all my sins before
[55:24] amen say lord forgive me lord cleanse me
[55:26] of my sins do you believe in the
[55:28] forgiveness of god
[55:29] though your sins be a scarlet they'll be
[55:31] white as snow though they'd be red like
[55:33] crimson
[55:34] amen i believe god could make hillary
[55:37] clinton a prayer warrior in this church
[55:38] do you believe that
[55:40] oh you say well she's done this this and
[55:41] this well then you don't believe that
[55:43] the blood of jesus christ cleanses us
[55:45] from all sins
[55:46] amen i believe it cleanses us from all
[55:48] sins so it says here he
[55:50] he paid the the debt for all men verse
[55:53] number 10
[55:54] and it became him for whom are all
[55:56] things and by are all things
[55:59] by whom are all things in bringing many
[56:02] sons
[56:03] unto glory to make the captain of our
[56:05] salvation perfect through
[56:07] suffering through suffering
[56:10] christ went through suffering and for
[56:14] both
[56:14] he that sanctifieth and they who are
[56:17] sanctified are all one for which cause
[56:19] he is not ashamed
[56:20] to call them brethren you have a family
[56:24] member like i'm not ashamed to call this
[56:25] my brother
[56:27] he's the bible says he's not ashamed to
[56:29] call you his brother
[56:31] it can only be by the blood of jesus
[56:33] christ
[56:34] i love the blood of jesus christ the
[56:36] bible says we're made nigh by the blood
[56:38] of jesus christ i've heard a lot of
[56:40] doctrines and things that make my head
[56:42] spend
[56:42] but i want to know from the scripture my
[56:44] faith that i'm made nigh to an eternal
[56:46] god by the blood of jesus christ
[56:49] and no one can take that away from me no
[56:51] one can take the scripture out of my
[56:53] heart you can
[56:54] amen you can take all my church from you
[56:56] can take my bible from me
[56:58] but you'll never take a revelation from
[57:00] my heart
[57:01] jesus said i'm going to build a church
[57:03] and the gates of hell will never
[57:04] prevail against this church and it's
[57:06] built on a rock of revelation
[57:09] so many people are built on knowledge i
[57:11] hate to say it a lot of people
[57:12] are built on stories and their faith
[57:15] rests on stories
[57:17] i went to sunset mountain here a few
[57:19] years ago
[57:20] and they had a lot of brothers and we
[57:22] went and it went from
[57:24] what the prophet of god said to a bunch
[57:25] of fanaticism and i could tell you a
[57:27] story and it didn't
[57:28] just a lot of fanaticism and the brother
[57:30] said wait we drove away they said man
[57:32] you're just a skeptic i'm like
[57:34] you've added two and take away brother
[57:36] rem said just say what i say on the
[57:37] tapes and what you're saying isn't what
[57:39] he said on the tapes
[57:40] people saying that blast came down and
[57:42] cut all the trees down to the ground
[57:44] and and uh i said well i don't think he
[57:47] said that i don't think he said that
[57:48] went back and looked at him he said he
[57:50] cut the tops of the trees out and so you
[57:51] go back and
[57:52] hear what the prophet of god said and
[57:54] that's why it's so crucial to say what
[57:56] the prophet of god said and say what the
[57:57] bible says i believe god came down
[58:00] at sunset mountain i believe in 1962
[58:03] brother branham had a vision he would
[58:04] come out and have a blast and even the
[58:06] vision left him numb for days
[58:08] he said then he comes out and he met the
[58:10] seven angels and there was a blast and
[58:11] he was caught up in a commission to go
[58:13] back and preach the seven seals and it
[58:15] happened just the way it was prophesied
[58:17] then he come out in 1964 and he goes up
[58:19] there and the day before
[58:20] the angel lord said throw it back throw
[58:23] that rock up in there he throws it up in
[58:24] the air
[58:25] and it comes back down and said judgment
[58:26] will hit the west coast
[58:28] and you'll see the power of god and just
[58:30] the next day they're in the camp he
[58:31] tells brother roberson
[58:32] i worked with brother roberts and he was
[58:34] an old veteran he didn't have any muscle
[58:36] i think in the back of his arm and he
[58:37] just held his arm like this
[58:38] and he didn't he was a trustee for
[58:40] brother branham and brother graham
[58:41] they're camping there
[58:42] and brother random told him said brother
[58:44] roberson he said
[58:45] be careful something's about to happen
[58:47] and get under something he was a veteran
[58:48] he got over away from brother
[58:50] adam stepped out and the bla whirlwind
[58:52] came down a blast came down three times
[58:54] so judgment is striking
[58:56] the west coast three days later i
[58:58] believe it was alaska almost sunk
[59:00] amen may god help us to realize these
[59:02] things that we believe are true god
[59:04] vindicated a message in this day i'll
[59:06] say this he didn't vindicate me
[59:08] and he didn't vindicate you he
[59:09] vindicated god's prophet
[59:11] amen paul said let us not nothing will
[59:13] separate us from the love of god and the
[59:15] scriptures that we see fulfilled in our
[59:17] day is that okay
[59:18] because it's a revelation and once it's
[59:21] revealed to you can't see anything but
[59:23] the revelation of god
[59:25] verse number go down here a little bit
[59:27] farther for the sake of time verse 15
[59:29] and deliver them who through the fear of
[59:31] death were all their lifetimes subject
[59:32] to bondom
[59:33] for verily he took not on him the nature
[59:36] of angels but he took on him the seed of
[59:38] of abraham wherefore in all things it
[59:41] behooved him to be made
[59:43] likened to his brethren that he may be a
[59:46] merciful
[59:47] and faithful high priest aren't you glad
[59:51] he's a faithful high priest who was it
[59:54] was it you brother aaron that spoke over
[59:55] here
[59:56] and said our god doesn't slumber was
[59:58] that you brother and it said that
[1:00:00] i think one of the brothers said he
[1:00:01] doesn't slumber he doesn't sleep it came
[1:00:03] up on the thing i remember i was sitting
[1:00:04] there and i was looking at the screen
[1:00:06] you didn't read that on sunday night one
[1:00:07] of the brothers he does not slumber he's
[1:00:09] not like
[1:00:10] hey i'm checking out here aren't you
[1:00:12] glad you have a private high priest that
[1:00:13] doesn't check out on you
[1:00:15] amen i need a high price priest the
[1:00:17] bible says he ever liveth to make
[1:00:19] intercession for us
[1:00:21] he says he's a faithful high priest in
[1:00:23] all things pertaining to god and to make
[1:00:25] reconciliation for the sins of the
[1:00:26] people
[1:00:27] in that he himself hath suffered being
[1:00:29] tempted
[1:00:30] he is able to sucker that word means
[1:00:32] sympathize
[1:00:34] with them that are tempted and so in the
[1:00:38] next chapter it says wherefore holy
[1:00:39] brethren
[1:00:40] partakers of the holy calling heavenly
[1:00:42] calling consider
[1:00:44] christ jesus consider christ jesus and i
[1:00:46] i wanted to think about that because
[1:00:48] it's
[1:00:48] it's interesting how the bible says it
[1:00:50] says christ jesus
[1:00:52] it just doesn't say jesus you all live
[1:00:55] here close to the border there's many
[1:00:56] people there to name jesus
[1:00:58] so it's just not jesus it's the anointed
[1:01:00] one christ means the anointed one
[1:01:03] this is christ jesus we do so many
[1:01:05] things by faith and we don't even
[1:01:06] realize what we're doing
[1:01:08] we have a cross up there you know that
[1:01:10] that that
[1:01:11] listen to me closer what we do is by
[1:01:13] faith
[1:01:15] do you know this cross up here is
[1:01:17] actually would be the equivalent of
[1:01:19] putting a
[1:01:20] an electric chair out somewhere
[1:01:23] it was the means of capital punishment
[1:01:25] in jesus day how many are with me
[1:01:27] so we would set an electric chair out
[1:01:28] there with the little armbands and the
[1:01:30] straps that they strapped them up there
[1:01:32] and we put a symbol of capital
[1:01:33] punishment in our churches
[1:01:36] not to symbolize what the romans did two
[1:01:38] thousand years but it symbolizes one
[1:01:40] thing it's an empty cross
[1:01:42] amen they took him off the cross and put
[1:01:44] him in a tomb if we had a tomb
[1:01:46] the the tomb would be empty and then
[1:01:48] christ rose from the dead
[1:01:50] so our symbol indicates our faith it
[1:01:53] doesn't indicate
[1:01:54] a capital punishment are you with me
[1:01:56] brother robert you see
[1:01:58] it's not just capital punishment by
[1:02:00] faith i look at a symbol
[1:02:01] and it strikes a it tells a story of
[1:02:04] faith
[1:02:06] we were talking the other day and i
[1:02:08] might even mention here you know we sing
[1:02:09] the song there is a fountain filled with
[1:02:11] blood
[1:02:11] people like i'm not going to your church
[1:02:13] you all got a water of a blood fountain
[1:02:15] at your church
[1:02:16] full of blood and you took it out of
[1:02:18] emanuel's veins and you take people and
[1:02:20] plunge them beneath the flood
[1:02:21] and they lose all their guilty stains
[1:02:24] you didn't think about what you're
[1:02:25] singing did you
[1:02:26] because you're singing by revelation
[1:02:28] you're singing by faith
[1:02:30] amen and every son of god amen has to
[1:02:33] make that trip by faith to calvary
[1:02:35] amen and kneel at the cross and be sorry
[1:02:37] for their sins and
[1:02:38] amen place their hands by faith on that
[1:02:41] sacrifice
[1:02:42] in the old testament they brought a lamb
[1:02:44] and that worshiper had to identify with
[1:02:46] their sacrifice
[1:02:48] this is my sacrifice oh blessed be the
[1:02:52] name of jesus
[1:02:53] i want to identify i want to identify
[1:02:55] just like pilate said i find no fault in
[1:02:57] him
[1:02:58] i find no fault in jesus christ
[1:03:01] hallelujah blessed be his name and
[1:03:03] when we sing about jesus we're not
[1:03:05] singing about some uh
[1:03:07] mexican girl's boyfriend named jesus
[1:03:10] we're singing about the christ jesus the
[1:03:13] anointed one the one that
[1:03:14] amen was virgin born one day behold a
[1:03:16] virgin shall conceive and the angel
[1:03:18] appeared to mary
[1:03:19] said that which can is conceived in you
[1:03:21] is of the holy ghost
[1:03:23] we don't believe it was part of the cell
[1:03:25] of the female mary and god
[1:03:27] impregnated no we believe the the seed
[1:03:29] was was god's seed
[1:03:31] and the egg and and the germ came
[1:03:33] together and it was god
[1:03:35] how's the bible saying acts was it 20
[1:03:37] there we were
[1:03:39] amen were purchased by the blood of god
[1:03:43] amen he was the virgin born son of god
[1:03:45] that's why hell couldn't hold him
[1:03:47] that's why amen he came different than
[1:03:49] all the other sex-born creatures
[1:03:51] and man he was virgin born amen he was
[1:03:54] the son of god that blood is a pure
[1:03:56] blood

[1:04:06] from the dead and sent out
[1:04:07] a holy ghost into the church amen to

[1:04:16] and many of y'all were there i've told
[1:04:17] this testimony i'm going to tell it
[1:04:18] again
[1:04:19] and that one brother i think it was i
[1:04:21] can't remember which brother had that
[1:04:22] little
[1:04:23] baby was it tears up on his shoulder and
[1:04:25] the baby fell off
[1:04:27] and landed on the concrete floor and i
[1:04:29] think the brother was about six foot
[1:04:30] tall i can't remember who it was that
[1:04:31] had him
[1:04:32] and he dropped the baby off and he
[1:04:34] landed on his head
[1:04:36] and brother john sanger said he works in
[1:04:38] the er and
[1:04:39] picked up the baby and one eye was
[1:04:40] looking this way and one eye was looking
[1:04:42] this way he said i knew it was serious
[1:04:44] and he called the brothers together

[1:04:50] brother john sanger and
[1:04:51] we just came together and we laid our
[1:04:53] hands on that little baby because the
[1:04:54] bible says they shall lay hands on the
[1:04:56] sick and they shall recover
[1:04:58] we just prayed a prayer of faith and the
[1:05:00] bible says the prayer of faith shall
[1:05:01] save the sick
[1:05:03] and the lord will raise them up and we
[1:05:05] laid our hands on that little baby and
[1:05:06] prayed for that little baby
[1:05:08] and god healed that baby delivered it
[1:05:10] completely its eyes came back normal

[1:05:37] forever we're not serving a
[1:05:38] a dead god we're serving a living god

[1:06:54] however you want to do it if it's
[1:06:56] through a miracle through its divine
[1:06:57] healing brother
[1:06:58] said 90 of healing is divine healing
[1:07:00] which is over
[1:07:02] time and it works but paul said the
[1:07:04] power that now works inside of you
[1:07:07] amen what was it the other day how many
[1:07:10] times i've seen little
[1:07:11] you get like i don't know what it is a
[1:07:13] growth or something on your body
[1:07:15] a prophet of god remember he tells us
[1:07:17] that in demonology if you go back
[1:07:18] brother
[1:07:18] preaches demonology spiritually and
[1:07:20] immunological demonology physically
[1:07:22] and jesus cursed the tree and he said
[1:07:25] now that's what it
[1:07:26] if you have a growth or a cancer in your
[1:07:28] body he said you don't talk to the body
[1:07:30] that lives and you talk to the life
[1:07:32] you take an animal and you you kill it
[1:07:34] you take the life out and after a while
[1:07:36] the body there and it decays
[1:07:38] so he says you get a growth or a cancer
[1:07:40] in your body he said when we pray he
[1:07:42] said we cast the devil out which is the
[1:07:44] the life of that growth and it kills it
[1:07:48] i remember the prophet god told me that
[1:07:49] and i had something on the back of my
[1:07:51] foot
[1:07:51] man it hurts so bad i remember i was in
[1:07:54] college i sat at a table this man said
[1:07:55] look god's not a healer he's not there's
[1:07:57] nothing happening
[1:07:59] no you come too late to tell me that
[1:08:00] because the night before i was so
[1:08:02] so sick i went up and said brothers just
[1:08:04] anoint me with oil and
[1:08:05] pray for me they'd done and i was
[1:08:07] sitting at a table testifying to this
[1:08:09] boy and he said oh god's not a healer i
[1:08:10] said no no i got prayed for last night
[1:08:12] and god's a healer i felt in my foot and
[1:08:13] it hurt so bad
[1:08:14] amen but he's the high priest of our
[1:08:16] profession our confession
[1:08:19] that's our subject tonight he's a high
[1:08:20] priest of your confession when you say
[1:08:22] oh i'm no good
[1:08:24] then you can't god can only undercede on
[1:08:26] what you say
[1:08:27] they say i am amen i am worth something
[1:08:29] jesus christ loves me so much he left
[1:08:31] the portals of heaven and came and died
[1:08:33] for me for god so loved daniel andes
[1:08:35] that he gave his only begotten son and
[1:08:37] if daniel anders would believe on him he
[1:08:39] would not perish but have everlasting
[1:08:41] life
[1:08:41] amen that's the way healing is you got
[1:08:43] to profess by his stripes i'm healed and
[1:08:45] then he starts interceding
[1:08:47] by his stripes he's healed by his
[1:08:49] stripes he's healed
[1:08:50] how long do you say it till you believe
[1:08:52] it
[1:08:53] so i testified to the boy and man we
[1:08:55] prayed in that thing there was a growth
[1:08:57] and the life went out of it a couple
[1:08:58] days later it just dried up and fell off
[1:09:00] my
[1:09:01] foot it was it was amazing my god's a
[1:09:03] healer
[1:09:04] so the other day i got a little growth
[1:09:05] in my hand i put my my arm and it came
[1:09:08] up and it was growth it was getting big
[1:09:09] i just put my hand on it saying
[1:09:11] lord jesus i curse the life that's in
[1:09:12] that growth just wait a couple days the
[1:09:14] life goes out of it just falls off my
[1:09:16] arm
[1:09:17] and man of god's a healer he's our
[1:09:19] deliverer
[1:09:20] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:09:22] that is in the world
[1:09:23] who was that the brother that stood up
[1:09:24] here the other day you know it's like
[1:09:26] bread you don't know where all the
[1:09:27] ingredients came from but you know you
[1:09:29] heard it right
[1:09:30] that's why it's so important whatsoever

[1:12:40] good to see our sister
[1:12:41] here tonight brother tim's mother god
[1:12:43] bless you sister
[1:12:44] amen i was thinking about this
[1:12:46] philippians chapter two
[1:12:48] i love the word of god amen i remember
[1:12:51] the first sermon we preached when we
[1:12:52] come here in the bible says that they
[1:12:54] the man's sword clave to his hand do you
[1:12:56] remember that sermon
[1:12:57] he fought so much when they tried to lay
[1:12:59] the sword down he couldn't lay it down
[1:13:00] because his hand was so tightly gripped
[1:13:02] to his sword and that's the way we ought
[1:13:04] to be
[1:13:05] remember ephesians chapter 6 the sword
[1:13:07] of the spirit which is the word of god
[1:13:08] we ought to just hold to the word of god
[1:13:10] and
[1:13:10] hold it and hold it do i understand
[1:13:12] everything about this book i don't
[1:13:14] understand everything about it but i
[1:13:15] know the devil is defeated by the word
[1:13:17] of god
[1:13:18] the word of god will defeat the devil
[1:13:19] any place anywhere anytime
[1:13:22] amen i love the scripture you know those
[1:13:25] people they talking about the blue devil
[1:13:27] and all that and that's
[1:13:28] that's really nice but they don't tell
[1:13:30] all the story brother and talks about
[1:13:31] the man backing up and the devil got
[1:13:32] bigger and bigger and he got littler and
[1:13:34] littler
[1:13:34] and then brother you know people like
[1:13:36] hey boo and then the devil that's not
[1:13:37] all the story brother man said he
[1:13:38] reached over and got the word of god
[1:13:41] amen it's just not saying boo devil boo
[1:13:43] devil it's quoting the scripture
[1:13:45] jesus trained us it's not little boo boo
[1:13:47] boo or whatever that is in spanish i
[1:13:49] don't know what it is in spanish
[1:13:50] and you're saying these little things
[1:13:52] amen the devil doesn't care about that
[1:13:54] he wants to hear the word of god jesus
[1:13:56] said it's written
[1:13:57] it's written it's written jesus didn't
[1:14:00] argue and fuss he just quoted the
[1:14:01] scripture
[1:14:03] praise the lord philippians chapter 2. i
[1:14:05] was thinking about this verse
[1:14:07] 5 let this mind be in you which is in
[1:14:10] christ
[1:14:11] jesus this isn't just jesus this is the
[1:14:13] anointed jesus
[1:14:16] let this mind be in you who being in the
[1:14:18] form of god thought it was not robbery
[1:14:20] to be equal with god why wasn't it
[1:14:22] robbery to be equal with god because he
[1:14:24] was god
[1:14:26] great is the mystery of god was god was
[1:14:28] manifested in the flesh
[1:14:30] is that timothy 3 16 god was manifested
[1:14:34] in the flesh
[1:14:35] and he made himself of no reputation it
[1:14:36] took upon him the form of a servant
[1:14:39] so you see people always want to be
[1:14:41] served and high and lifted up
[1:14:44] they don't have the mind that was in
[1:14:45] christ the bible says let he that is
[1:14:47] great among you be your servant
[1:14:50] you see people want to be ministers the
[1:14:51] greatest way to minister is find the
[1:14:53] weakest spot
[1:14:54] and help minister at that weak place
[1:14:57] that's what ministry is it's not holding
[1:14:59] a microphone and it's ministering to the
[1:15:01] needs
[1:15:03] and the bible says let this mind be in
[1:15:04] you that was in christ
[1:15:07] and was made in the likeness of man and
[1:15:09] being found in the fashion
[1:15:10] as a man he humbled himself and became
[1:15:13] obedient unto death even the death of
[1:15:15] the cross
[1:15:16] wherefore god hath all hath also hath
[1:15:19] highly exalted him and given him a name
[1:15:21] which is above
[1:15:22] every name
[1:15:25] the name of jesus christ is above the
[1:15:27] name william branham
[1:15:28] it's the name above every name people
[1:15:32] that deity spirit comes around remember
[1:15:34] brother branham when he
[1:15:35] went beyond the curtain of time he's
[1:15:36] there and he's meeting all these people
[1:15:37] what was his
[1:15:38] what was his desire when he got there he
[1:15:40] said i want to see
[1:15:41] jesus i said oh well he no
[1:15:44] he's a little higher remember that jesus
[1:15:48] is always higher
[1:15:49] he's always higher he's always hiring we
[1:15:51] want to keep him high and lift it up
[1:15:53] isaiah said
[1:15:54] i went in he said he's high and lifted
[1:15:56] up and his train filled the temple
[1:15:59] oh blessed be the name of jesus and that
[1:16:01] at the name of
[1:16:02] jesus every knee shall bow of things in
[1:16:05] heaven
[1:16:06] and things in earth and things under the
[1:16:08] earth and every tongue shall confess
[1:16:10] that jesus christ is lord to the glory
[1:16:12] of god the father
[1:16:14] i was thinking about this brother adam
[1:16:16] said god came down in a blood cell not
[1:16:19] through a man but by the holy ghost
[1:16:21] in that virgin womb a tabernacle for the
[1:16:24] purpose
[1:16:25] of death was built we were thinking
[1:16:28] about this the other day brother and i
[1:16:30] we went up to sword mountain brother
[1:16:32] jeff loker and i were walking down we
[1:16:34] were talking about the messiah and
[1:16:36] how each person's got to do what they're
[1:16:38] ordained to do
[1:16:40] just after jesus you know we're talking
[1:16:41] about churches jesus when he got done
[1:16:43] with his ministry he had 12
[1:16:45] and one of them was the devil and jesus
[1:16:48] looks at the
[1:16:49] devil how's the bible saying the devil
[1:16:50] having now entered the heart of jesus
[1:16:52] judas is carrying simon's son to betray
[1:16:54] him that's our communion service
[1:16:56] and jesus looks at this disciple and he
[1:16:58] says what you
[1:16:59] do do it quickly do it quickly
[1:17:03] so jesus and remember we talked to this
[1:17:06] about preached about seasons and he
[1:17:07] comes to this season and jesus looks
[1:17:10] at the the the the ones coming to attack
[1:17:12] him he said this is your hour
[1:17:14] and the hour of darkness it was his hour
[1:17:17] he said you know as long as i'm in the
[1:17:19] world i am the lighter world but he said
[1:17:20] now this is your hour
[1:17:22] this is your in other you play chessy
[1:17:24] like this is my move
[1:17:25] and now jesus said look it's your move
[1:17:28] it's your move i can't do anything it's
[1:17:30] your moment he tells judas
[1:17:31] hey what you're doing do it quickly do
[1:17:34] it
[1:17:34] do what you i tell people i said do
[1:17:37] whatever god leads you to do
[1:17:39] do whatever god leads you to do we so i
[1:17:42] was thinking about that jesus
[1:17:44] the bible says in acts that we're saved
[1:17:46] by the blood of god and now this blood
[1:17:48] of god is within christ
[1:17:50] but it without the shedding of blood
[1:17:51] there's no remission of sins
[1:17:53] so we have the lamb of god but unless
[1:17:55] that blood is shed we have no remission
[1:17:57] of sins
[1:17:59] oh praise the lord so he needed a judas
[1:18:03] to betray him to put him on a cross that
[1:18:06] that blood could be shed for your sins
[1:18:08] in my
[1:18:09] sense oh my isn't the plan of salvation
[1:18:12] wonderful
[1:18:13] and it all started back in genesis what
[1:18:16] is it a timeline starts this way to
[1:18:17] we're talking the other day about hebrew
[1:18:19] and they do it backwards i think the
[1:18:20] hebrew it's
[1:18:21] it's backwards but so way back in the
[1:18:24] beginning
[1:18:24] and god needed he had this great plan of
[1:18:27] redemption but he needed somebody
[1:18:29] to be the villain and now here's cain
[1:18:32] and abel
[1:18:32] and cain kills abel and god could have
[1:18:34] slain cain and it would all been over
[1:18:36] but he put a mark on him
[1:18:38] and said don't mark don't kill this man
[1:18:41] i need his seed
[1:18:42] all the way down here how the bible says
[1:18:45] he'll bruise your heel
[1:18:46] but i'll crush his head and he said
[1:18:49] don't don't kill this man because i need
[1:18:51] the serpent seed all the way you see how
[1:18:53] it's all playing out in god's plan
[1:18:55] it's all playing out you say is there a
[1:18:58] judas among the message there probably
[1:19:00] is but
[1:19:00] that's okay it just plays his part just
[1:19:03] play your part
[1:19:04] i want to play my part he said for the
[1:19:07] purpose of death it was built the seed
[1:19:10] of the woman
[1:19:11] came in order that he was be bruised to
[1:19:13] bring our salvation when the holy ghost
[1:19:15] came upon mary
[1:19:16] he was created in a womb the cell that
[1:19:19] would multiply and became the body of
[1:19:21] our lord
[1:19:21] that cell was created it was the
[1:19:23] beginning of the creation of god
[1:19:25] i think what is that john 3 16 the only
[1:19:28] begotten son
[1:19:30] adam was a created son but now as a
[1:19:32] begotten son
[1:19:34] christ he goes on to talk about he said
[1:19:36] oh how striking
[1:19:37] jehovah crying over maneuver manure
[1:19:40] power jehovah born
[1:19:42] in a manger of straw jehovah playing as
[1:19:45] a boy jehovah working in a carpenter
[1:19:46] shop jehovah
[1:19:47] washing the feet of the fishermen he
[1:19:50] said i will give you a sign god said not
[1:19:52] the sign of a white collared priesthood
[1:19:54] not the wealth the sign of wealth and
[1:19:56] power there's nothing
[1:19:58] in this sign that you would want or
[1:20:00] think suitable but it is an everlasting
[1:20:02] sign it is the greatest sign of
[1:20:04] all jehovah standing in the courtyard
[1:20:06] bruised and bleeding with thorns on his
[1:20:08] brow
[1:20:09] spit on his face mocked and said it not
[1:20:12] jehovah despised and rejected
[1:20:15] hanging naked on a cross you think about
[1:20:18] that the other day i was just
[1:20:19] meditating on upon that the shame now we
[1:20:23] put a little
[1:20:24] cloth on it for for decency but now
[1:20:26] there is the creator hanging
[1:20:28] naked on a cross publicly the romans did
[1:20:31] that
[1:20:32] to to curb uh uh the violence of an
[1:20:35] insurrection against the government
[1:20:37] and the person that was in it uh raising
[1:20:39] this insurrection they hung them on a
[1:20:41] cross
[1:20:41] naked and people went by and saw like oh
[1:20:43] i better never raise up against the
[1:20:45] governor i bet
[1:20:45] and there jesus hung in shame jehovah
[1:20:49] our savior my doesn't that just make you
[1:20:52] want to go and sit down and cry
[1:20:55] hung him on a cross and actually or the
[1:20:57] earth had a nervous breakdown
[1:20:58] the sun said i can't even shine the
[1:21:00] creation just hung the creator
[1:21:03] and the sun refused to shine and the
[1:21:05] earth had a nervous breakdown like
[1:21:06] what did man what was made in the image
[1:21:09] of god just do to the creator
[1:21:10] they hung him on a cross and the earth
[1:21:13] had a nervous breakdown
[1:21:15] what were we talking the other day about
[1:21:17] the devil believe wasn't any trembles
[1:21:22] the devil believes there's one god and
[1:21:23] he trembles as the one man said if he
[1:21:25] believed in three gods he'd have a
[1:21:26] nervous breakdown
[1:21:30] how's it say in the scripture the old
[1:21:31] testament said if there's
[1:21:33] there's one god and if there's another i
[1:21:35] know not i know not who he is i don't
[1:21:36] know who he is
[1:21:38] amen so he was bleeding hanging naked on
[1:21:41] the cross
[1:21:42] while the hypocrites jeered and dared
[1:21:44] him to come down off the cross
[1:21:47] jehovah died jehovah praying nothing
[1:21:50] happened
[1:21:50] you ever feel like that way you pray and
[1:21:52] nothing's happened
[1:21:54] you're going through something god's
[1:21:55] molding character in us
[1:21:57] god's doing something just like he did
[1:21:59] with christ
[1:22:00] then he died and that was a sign for all
[1:22:02] men now there isn't another like it
[1:22:04] and it is a great one then darkness came
[1:22:06] upon the earth they put him in a tomb
[1:22:08] there he laid there three days and three
[1:22:10] nights until the earthquake shattered
[1:22:11] the gloom of the night
[1:22:13] and he came forth jehovah came forth
[1:22:14] jehovah ascended on high
[1:22:16] jehovah returned to indwell his church
[1:22:18] jehovah came back with a mighty rushing
[1:22:21] wind and
[1:22:21] flames of fire jehovah came back to walk
[1:22:24] in the midst of his church and empower
[1:22:26] his church once more jehovah came
[1:22:28] this time to stay in his people
[1:22:31] he wanted to live in his people we were
[1:22:33] talking to someone the other day
[1:22:34] and it's really inspiring if you try to
[1:22:36] go and you really try to witness
[1:22:38] not about the trinity about the oneness
[1:22:40] of the godhead and god the father was
[1:22:42] above the people and all that was in
[1:22:44] christ he poor
[1:22:44] god he poured into christ and all that
[1:22:47] christ was he poured into a
[1:22:49] his church and when you say i am
[1:22:52] filled with the holy ghost what are you
[1:22:54] saying
[1:22:56] what are you saying you're saying the
[1:22:58] great almighty spirit of god that
[1:23:00] created the heavens and the earth in the
[1:23:01] beginning god created the heaven earth
[1:23:03] and now he lives inside of a people
[1:23:07] oh praise his name amen that ought to
[1:23:09] just
[1:23:10] just cause your backbone just to stiffen
[1:23:13] up and say
[1:23:13] thank you lord jesus not by works of
[1:23:16] righteousness that we have done
[1:23:17] amen that's our subject tonight consider
[1:23:20] christ jesus
[1:23:21] consider he that is in you brother and
[1:23:24] preaches a message
[1:23:26] uh he that is in you identifies the
[1:23:27] first uh identification of the
[1:23:29] of the third pull and the five
[1:23:31] identifications of the
[1:23:33] fish down on dale hollow where we go
[1:23:35] down at the lake and the fish that was
[1:23:37] resurrection and hatty right and the
[1:23:38] storm stop and
[1:23:39] the tumor and the creation of the
[1:23:41] squirrels and the five identifications
[1:23:42] of the
[1:23:43] of the third pool i know some of my
[1:23:44] brothers they get out uh
[1:23:46] you know and they get it you know say
[1:23:48] speak the word and a lot of that stuff
[1:23:49] but you got to remember brother bannon
[1:23:50] was there and the angel came to him
[1:23:52] he said what do you mean he said i don't
[1:23:54] need anything he said what are you doing
[1:23:55] he said i'm hunting
[1:23:57] he said well why don't you speak to the
[1:23:59] squirrel he speaks to the squirrel he
[1:24:00] was going
[1:24:00] remember the storm he that is in you if
[1:24:02] you're missing he was going down he told
[1:24:04] us hey get out of the storm you'll die
[1:24:05] and he's going out running out of the
[1:24:06] storm
[1:24:07] and the voice speaks to him go back into
[1:24:09] the storm
[1:24:11] it wasn't william branham coming up with
[1:24:12] this stuff hey i think i'll do this and
[1:24:14] speak in elk here and
[1:24:15] my water bill is gone and not no the
[1:24:17] angel came to him
[1:24:18] and told him what to speak even with his
[1:24:21] wife said speak it and it will be
[1:24:26] it's not just man running out induced
[1:24:28] god jesus said i can do nothing but what
[1:24:30] the father
[1:24:31] shows me and god is bringing us through
[1:24:33] that time
[1:24:34] because most of us probably all of us
[1:24:36] would speak all of our trials out of
[1:24:38] out of existence think of what you're
[1:24:40] going through right now
[1:24:41] and god give anything like oh let this
[1:24:43] brother in the church just be gone
[1:24:45] this lord poof but the bible says your
[1:24:48] trials are more precious than gold
[1:24:51] they're to try you and bring forth the
[1:24:53] character of christ in you
[1:24:56] may god help us not to speak our trials
[1:24:58] out of existence
[1:25:00] amen i was thinking about that the
[1:25:02] gospel of christ it's a finished work on
[1:25:04] calvary
[1:25:05] go to first john chapter after um
[1:25:09] first john chapter one i'm gonna use
[1:25:11] brother reginald searle's illustration
[1:25:13] our sister marlene's father he came to
[1:25:15] our church
[1:25:16] i was just a young man this is probably
[1:25:17] 25 years ago this is how powerful the
[1:25:20] preaching of the gospel is
[1:25:21] when you open up your mind your womb and
[1:25:23] someone can say something and point you
[1:25:24] to scripture and brand you we call it
[1:25:26] branding in the business world
[1:25:27] and he branded us and i was going to do
[1:25:29] it tonight but i don't know that we can
[1:25:31] because there's not a way
[1:25:32] and i didn't figure out how to turn the
[1:25:33] lights off first john chapter 1
[1:25:36] and verse number 7. the bible says if we
[1:25:39] walk
[1:25:40] in the light as he is in the light we
[1:25:41] have fellowship one with another
[1:25:43] and the blood of jesus christ his son
[1:25:46] cleanses us from all sin does your bible
[1:25:48] say all
[1:25:49] it says all sins so brother reginald was
[1:25:53] at our church it's probably been 25
[1:25:54] maybe 30 years ago and he turned all the
[1:25:56] lights out we're in a little storefront
[1:25:58] mission
[1:25:59] and he got a little flashlight and he
[1:26:00] held it over his head and he just walked
[1:26:02] like this i remember him walking
[1:26:04] like this and he quoted the scripture he
[1:26:06] said if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:26:08] the light
[1:26:09] he said we have fellowship one with
[1:26:11] another so we know that the light is the
[1:26:14] word of god
[1:26:15] and if we lo walk in the light of the
[1:26:17] word remember david said thy word is a
[1:26:19] lamp unto my feet and a light into my
[1:26:20] pathway
[1:26:21] and if we walk in the light of god's
[1:26:23] word we have fellowship with god
[1:26:26] do you believe that we have fellowship
[1:26:28] with god
[1:26:29] but when you start cussing you don't
[1:26:31] walk in the light because the bible says
[1:26:33] let no corrupt communication proceed out
[1:26:35] of your mouth
[1:26:37] so when you when you lie the bible says
[1:26:39] lie not one to another then you're not
[1:26:41] walking in the light and you have no
[1:26:42] fellowship with god
[1:26:44] we could go down the list and let the
[1:26:45] holy spirit just say to you what the
[1:26:48] light is
[1:26:48] and maybe you're not walking in the
[1:26:50] light in the holy spirit he says i'm
[1:26:51] illuminating but you're away from me you
[1:26:53] don't have fellowship with me
[1:26:57] if we walk in the light
[1:27:00] we have fellowship and the blood of
[1:27:03] jesus
[1:27:04] christ cleanses us from all sin when
[1:27:06] we're walking in the light of the word
[1:27:07] of god
[1:27:08] because when the light illuminates us
[1:27:09] and he says oh
[1:27:11] i'm going to cheat on my taxes well
[1:27:12] you're not walking in the light
[1:27:15] you're stealing render unto caesar that
[1:27:17] which is caesar's provide things honest
[1:27:19] before all men
[1:27:20] and then you say lord jesus forgive me
[1:27:22] and whatever you got to do to make it
[1:27:23] right then you walk back in the light
[1:27:25] you have fellowship with god again
[1:27:27] and the blood of jesus christ cleanses
[1:27:29] us from all sins
[1:27:30] isn't that a good verse it's a good
[1:27:32] illustration i wish i had the flashlight
[1:27:33] in the lights we'd do the whole
[1:27:34] thing but it's it's a wonderful
[1:27:36] scripture and then i was thinking over
[1:27:37] in john we read this the other day saint
[1:27:39] john
[1:27:40] don't you love the word of god amen i
[1:27:42] don't want
[1:27:43] to be a part of a movement that's just a
[1:27:45] feel-good thing i want to know what we
[1:27:47] believe comes from the scripture
[1:27:49] and if we're anchored to the scripture
[1:27:50] there's nothing that can shake you off
[1:27:52] the word of god
[1:27:53] amen you can take my bible from me but
[1:27:55] i've already had the word of god in my
[1:27:57] heart that i would not sin against god
[1:27:58] that was david i think right you can
[1:28:00] lock me away in the prison but i know
[1:28:02] if i walk in the light as he is in the
[1:28:04] light the blood of jesus christ
[1:28:05] we have fellowship and the blood of
[1:28:06] jesus christ cleanses us from all sin
[1:28:10] and you know the two verses behind that
[1:28:12] 9-1-1 right that was the one right
[1:28:14] behind that
[1:28:15] 9-1-1 backwards first john 1 9 if we
[1:28:18] confess our sins he's faithful and just
[1:28:20] to forgive us of our sins
[1:28:22] you can take my bible but you'll never
[1:28:24] take the word of god out of my heart
[1:28:26] you'll never take it out of my heart
[1:28:31] what is the only sin
[1:28:34] unbelief david said thy word have i hid
[1:28:36] in my heart that i won't disbelieve
[1:28:38] against god
[1:28:41] amen drop that piece of paper again you
[1:28:44] better read it
[1:28:47] and when you're filled with the spirit
[1:28:48] here's one of the best signs i know
[1:28:51] you're so in love with christ and
[1:28:53] believe every word that he says to be
[1:28:54] the truth
[1:28:55] see that's the evidence that you have
[1:28:57] the holy ghost
[1:28:58] and your life's full of joy and oh my
[1:29:01] everything's different see
[1:29:02] than it used to be that's the holy ghost
[1:29:05] that's the holy ghost we want in our
[1:29:07] life
[1:29:08] love christ with all of our heart and
[1:29:09] believe all of his word
[1:29:12] amen that's fell out of my bible twice
[1:29:14] for a reason i've
[1:29:15] told one day i'm going to preach the
[1:29:17] things in my bible
[1:29:19] and all the things that i have in here
[1:29:22] brother iran says this in the message
[1:29:23] love
[1:29:25] nothing but lost souls is the only thing
[1:29:27] that's got any value in it
[1:29:29] money passes away houses decay and go
[1:29:32] away
[1:29:32] everything in the world moves away the
[1:29:35] only value lasting value
[1:29:37] i'd rather have one soul in glory that i
[1:29:40] want to christ to know and to see that
[1:29:42] light of god
[1:29:43] circling around that soul through all
[1:29:45] eternity my
[1:29:46] name to be associated with that then
[1:29:50] to have every penny of money in the
[1:29:52] whole world
[1:29:53] because i'd have to lose it all but when
[1:29:55] you send it up there is eternal what you
[1:29:58] send up there is eternal
[1:29:59] and that's the reason we're trying
[1:30:03] that's the reason we're trying i don't
[1:30:05] understand it brother and said somehow
[1:30:06] your name
[1:30:07] will be associated with that soul for
[1:30:09] all of eternity
[1:30:11] i don't know if their crown will have
[1:30:12] your name in it but he said somehow you
[1:30:14] whoever the bible says he that went to
[1:30:16] souls is wise
[1:30:18] and somehow you'll be associated with
[1:30:20] that soul for all of eternity
[1:30:22] one soul is worth 10 million worlds you
[1:30:25] see i
[1:30:26] am easily influenced so i keep that in
[1:30:27] my bible and that reminds me when the
[1:30:29] devil comes and says ah
[1:30:31] no i just keep it there one soul amen he
[1:30:34] said that's why we're trying first
[1:30:36] first or saint john chapter three we're
[1:30:38] talking about walking in the light as he
[1:30:39] is in the light
[1:30:40] john 3 16 we read this the other day we
[1:30:42] want to go down to verse 19.
[1:30:45] john 3 19 and this is the condemnation
[1:30:48] that light is coming to the world and
[1:30:51] men loved darkness they had an affection
[1:30:54] they just
[1:30:55] craved darkness so what your bible says
[1:30:59] they
[1:30:59] love darkness rather than light why
[1:31:02] because their
[1:31:03] deeds were evil their action actually
[1:31:06] their very
[1:31:07] nature was dark and their very nature
[1:31:09] was evil
[1:31:11] but he that doth
[1:31:15] verse 20 and everyone that doeth evil
[1:31:18] hateth the light
[1:31:19] jesus said don't worry if they hated me
[1:31:21] they're going to hate you don't think
[1:31:22] everybody's
[1:31:23] he said actually beware when everybody
[1:31:25] speaks well of you
[1:31:26] sometimes that when you're with
[1:31:27] unbelievers and everybody speaks well if
[1:31:29] you're not shining your light bright
[1:31:30] enough
[1:31:31] you're not showing your purpose great
[1:31:33] enough
[1:31:35] everyone that doeth evil hateth the
[1:31:37] light neither cometh to the light
[1:31:38] why lest his deeds should be reproved
[1:31:43] i was reading this book the brother put
[1:31:44] together some a book of of
[1:31:46] a subject of just on spirits and brother
[1:31:49] battery comes as a deserve he said
[1:31:50] nobody move around he said because you
[1:31:52] all come to me like waves spirits and he
[1:31:54] said
[1:31:54] here's an unbeliever there's a believer
[1:31:56] and he's just trying to he said when i
[1:31:58] talked to you he said i'm talking to
[1:31:59] your spirit not your body he said i'm
[1:32:01] trying to contact your spirit
[1:32:03] and that's what he's saying here he's
[1:32:06] people don't want to come to the light
[1:32:07] because their deeds
[1:32:08] are reproved so when you get by one
[1:32:11] you've got long hair and you're a sister
[1:32:12] you just walk in and you don't say
[1:32:14] anything
[1:32:15] and you're a light to them and it brings
[1:32:16] conviction on them
[1:32:18] so don't feel bad when they want to get
[1:32:19] away from you don't get a complex like
[1:32:22] no just you know praise the lord
[1:32:27] he that doeth truth cometh to the light
[1:32:29] that his deeds maybe
[1:32:30] may manifest that they are wrought in
[1:32:33] god
[1:32:34] amen may god help us i'm going to skip
[1:32:36] over some of this just for the sake of
[1:32:38] time let's go to romans chapter
[1:32:40] 8 verse 28 this should be one of the
[1:32:42] scriptures that you've hid in your heart
[1:32:44] this is one of the most basic ones in
[1:32:46] the bible
[1:32:48] but sometimes we just pass over it as
[1:32:50] just something we
[1:32:51] say this is one of those we know verses
[1:32:56] starts it out verse romans 8 28 and we
[1:32:59] know
[1:33:00] now paul is talking to the romans they
[1:33:02] were heathens
[1:33:04] but they got to the place that he said
[1:33:05] hey we know this i wonder if we know
[1:33:07] this
[1:33:08] you know before we were talking about
[1:33:10] people being babes in christ and they
[1:33:11] should have grown up and been teachers
[1:33:13] paul said i've come to you i'm i'm
[1:33:14] amazed when you should be a teacher
[1:33:16] and you're just a babe you don't even
[1:33:18] have the fundamentals of christianity
[1:33:20] and paul comes to the place and says
[1:33:22] we know this we know that all things
[1:33:25] does your bible say all
[1:33:26] right now some of us believe that the
[1:33:28] blood of jesus christ cleanses us from
[1:33:30] all sins and we'll believe that but we
[1:33:32] can't believe this all
[1:33:33] lord i just can't believe that what's
[1:33:36] the rest of that say
[1:33:37] all things work together for good
[1:33:41] not to everybody it's to them that love
[1:33:44] god so the main thing is love god and
[1:33:47] then you know that everything that
[1:33:48] happens to you is working
[1:33:50] together for your good everything is
[1:33:53] working together for good to them that
[1:33:55] love
[1:33:55] god to them who are the called according
[1:33:58] to his purpose
[1:34:02] and then he goes on that's where we stop
[1:34:03] sometimes but he goes on to say
[1:34:05] for whom he did for no he also did
[1:34:07] predestinate and that's where a lot of
[1:34:09] people stop right there oh i'm
[1:34:11] predestinated i'm predestined
[1:34:13] and this is the thing that really
[1:34:14] bothers me around our message this is
[1:34:16] what really gets me in trouble because i
[1:34:17] press
[1:34:18] people and they say oh i'm predestinated
[1:34:20] but that's not what the bible says
[1:34:21] you're predestinated to what you're
[1:34:24] predestinated
[1:34:26] to be conformed to the image of his dear
[1:34:30] son
[1:34:31] so what is the image of his dear son in
[1:34:34] the beginning was the word the word was
[1:34:35] with god and the word was god so you say
[1:34:37] you're predestinated but
[1:34:39] they talk well i'm a predestinated seed
[1:34:40] but god never did predestinate seeds to
[1:34:42] stay in the packet
[1:34:43] he extended except a corner wheat buy a
[1:34:46] a
[1:34:46] die and go into the ground it abides
[1:34:48] alone it's just a pack on the
[1:34:50] that's a nice potentially that has
[1:34:52] potential made in the image but now it
[1:34:54] has to fall in the ground remember our
[1:34:55] sermon you must be born again
[1:34:57] he that is not born of water and of
[1:34:59] spirit washed by the water the land
[1:35:01] interprets that water washed by the
[1:35:03] water people don't want to be washed by
[1:35:04] the water of the word
[1:35:05] they say oh lord forgive me of my sins
[1:35:07] but they refuse to be washed by the
[1:35:09] water of the word
[1:35:11] and that's what the bible says here to
[1:35:12] be conformed to the image of his dear
[1:35:14] son
[1:35:15] and that's the troubling thing as we
[1:35:16] come closer and we've been in the
[1:35:18] message for 20
[1:35:19] 30 40 years sometimes somebody coming
[1:35:21] just come in we baptize and we expect
[1:35:22] them to be a child but now we've been in
[1:35:24] the message for 20 30 40 years
[1:35:26] and you're should be a teacher should be
[1:35:29] conforming to the image and we see
[1:35:31] worldliness and things of the world
[1:35:33] because let me just stop right here
[1:35:34] everybody's predestinated
[1:35:39] pharaoh was predestinated judas was
[1:35:41] predestinated so
[1:35:42] don't get by with the predestination
[1:35:44] thing right here it is predestinated to
[1:35:46] be conformed to his image
[1:35:50] lord help us tonight if we don't have
[1:35:52] the image of
[1:35:53] his dear son say lord jesus christ help
[1:35:56] me lord
[1:35:57] lord conform me today how's he say
[1:35:59] romans 12
[1:36:00] be not conformed to this world but be ye
[1:36:02] transformed by the renewing of our mind
[1:36:05] lord
[1:36:05] renew my mind lord renew my mind why was
[1:36:09] it ephesians i just want to go to
[1:36:10] ephesians here those great
[1:36:12] words of predestination i was meditating
[1:36:14] on that ephesians 1 this morning
[1:36:16] ephesians 1 5.
[1:36:21] the bible says back to 4 ephesians 1 4
[1:36:24] according as he
[1:36:26] this is god hath chosen us in in him
[1:36:29] before the foundation of the world
[1:36:31] oh i love that verse oh isn't that a
[1:36:32] wonderful verse go over to
[1:36:34] romans what is it revelations 13 8 and
[1:36:37] and 17 8 having written their names in
[1:36:39] the lamb's book of life before the
[1:36:41] foundation of the world oh it's just we
[1:36:42] could just run and shout in glory i love
[1:36:44] the
[1:36:45] subject of predestination chosen in him
[1:36:48] before the foundation
[1:36:49] but that's not all of it that we should
[1:36:52] be holy
[1:36:54] oh my goodness there's more to just
[1:36:56] being predestinated that we he's
[1:36:57] predestined and we might be holy
[1:36:59] others we know that there's none of us
[1:37:01] righteous no no the best we can do is
[1:37:02] this filthy rags
[1:37:04] but our only perfection comes through
[1:37:05] jesus christ
[1:37:07] i'd love to preach hebrews chapter 10
[1:37:09] right here for by one sacrifice hath he
[1:37:11] perfected forever them that are
[1:37:13] sanctified
[1:37:14] that's a whole other sermon hebrews
[1:37:15] chapter 10 one of my favorite chapters
[1:37:17] in the bible
[1:37:18] he hath perfected us through jesus
[1:37:19] christ and we're holy through christ
[1:37:22] that we holy and without blame before
[1:37:26] him in love
[1:37:27] having predestinated us unto the
[1:37:29] adoption
[1:37:31] you go back and he do the hebrew saying
[1:37:33] not a child anymore but now adoption
[1:37:35] which is hey
[1:37:36] whatever daddy says get a pen i got a
[1:37:38] pen here somewhere
[1:37:39] and he gives you the pen says all right
[1:37:40] brother matt here's the checkbook i'm
[1:37:42] leaving
[1:37:43] whatever you think we need you just sign
[1:37:45] the checkin and he's coming to manhood
[1:37:47] adoption
[1:37:49] he's predestinated us unto that place of
[1:37:52] adoption
[1:37:53] remember jesus come to the place and
[1:37:55] voice came from heaven this is my
[1:37:57] beloved son hear him
[1:37:59] hear him
[1:38:02] my goodness so many things go through my
[1:38:04] mind right here
[1:38:06] you know paul tells timothy i don't i
[1:38:09] can't remember
[1:38:10] he said let no man despise thy youth
[1:38:13] but in other words if you're five years
[1:38:16] old or seven and
[1:38:17] god gives don't let anybody like your
[1:38:19] kid no but then there's a qualification
[1:38:21] that comes with that
[1:38:22] but be thou an example of the believer
[1:38:26] i would like to preach over there what
[1:38:28] is it hebrews
[1:38:29] or titus or timothy one of them there he
[1:38:31] tells the the young man he said be sober
[1:38:34] be vigilant
[1:38:35] and be thou up have a pattern of good
[1:38:37] works
[1:38:39] isn't this sobering we're reading the
[1:38:42] scripture i don't know i'm not running
[1:38:43] the run shout jumping all the way
[1:38:45] but now we're actually seeing from the
[1:38:47] scripture brother daniel you're
[1:38:48] predestinated
[1:38:49] but you're predestinated to be conformed
[1:38:50] to his image you're predestinated unto
[1:38:52] adoption and a young man you should be
[1:38:54] sober
[1:38:55] and have a pattern of good works you all
[1:38:58] probably done this before what is a
[1:38:59] pattern
[1:39:00] it's when you take your hand and you do
[1:39:03] you have done this in school or
[1:39:04] somewhere hopefully not on the wall
[1:39:07] and you make a pattern
[1:39:10] and you say just cut that out and it'll
[1:39:12] match my hand
[1:39:14] and paul is telling us you be the
[1:39:16] pattern that other people come
[1:39:18] paul told timothy look you just follow
[1:39:19] me as i follow christ
[1:39:21] that's what we're predestinated it's
[1:39:23] sobering it's like
[1:39:24] and we were at camp we were at um not
[1:39:27] byc we're at
[1:39:29] brother ron's camp and they had one of
[1:39:31] these uh
[1:39:32] they had one of these a-frame buildings
[1:39:35] some of you all been there and it goes
[1:39:36] all down it's like five
[1:39:37] three foot off the ground and i told the
[1:39:39] kids i said you know what keeps me from
[1:39:41] climbing up there and running up the top
[1:39:42] and running down the other side there's
[1:39:43] this
[1:39:43] one scripture in the bible that keeps me
[1:39:45] from doing that the bible says
[1:39:47] be thou a pattern of good works because
[1:39:50] if i do it everybody else is gonna
[1:39:51] follow me
[1:39:52] and do the same thing
[1:39:56] so you got to see you realize you know
[1:39:57] the bible tells me that i got to have a
[1:40:00] pattern of good works
[1:40:01] i don't want to i don't want the bible
[1:40:03] telling me what to do then you can't be
[1:40:04] a christian
[1:40:05] and jesus is not going to ask you to do
[1:40:07] something that he couldn't do
[1:40:09] they brought him the bible says he was
[1:40:11] led as a lamb to the slaughter
[1:40:13] that's one thing but there was another
[1:40:15] verse says and he opened not his mouth
[1:40:17] so when they say tell us who hit you
[1:40:19] tell you tell us who hit you
[1:40:20] there was a verse in isaiah that said he
[1:40:23] couldn't open his mouth
[1:40:26] see look let's not you committed
[1:40:27] adultery and you did this this this
[1:40:29] and he knew it he could have done it and
[1:40:32] he was bound by the scripture and he
[1:40:34] didn't asking you to do anything that he
[1:40:35] wasn't bound by
[1:40:37] oh lord help us you know it's just some
[1:40:39] feel good religion bring us some coffee
[1:40:41] and
[1:40:42] how much cream you want your coffee hey
[1:40:43] now take it into church have a good time
[1:40:45] hey god bless you
[1:40:47] no we're actually seeing that i've got
[1:40:49] to be the image of this dear son of
[1:40:52] amen may god help us go on here where
[1:40:55] were we romans chapter 8
[1:40:58] this preaching isn't very popular is it
[1:41:01] i'll never win any popularity contest
[1:41:04] but that's not my goal my goal is if god
[1:41:08] calls me to be a minister of the gospel
[1:41:10] of jesus christ
[1:41:12] i have a responsibility to minister the
[1:41:14] word of god
[1:41:15] not my own ideas from the scripture he
[1:41:17] goes on to say
[1:41:19] conform to his image that he might be
[1:41:20] the firstborn among many brethren
[1:41:22] moreover whom he did predestinate
[1:41:24] them he also called you feel called
[1:41:27] tonight
[1:41:31] you're in a church and something calls
[1:41:32] you if he predestined he's going to call
[1:41:35] you somewhere you get a call from god
[1:41:37] and whom he called them he also
[1:41:39] justified what is justification it's
[1:41:41] just
[1:41:42] as if you never did it the full
[1:41:44] revelation it's just
[1:41:46] this now that'll make us shout and run
[1:41:48] the isles you sin you confess it to god
[1:41:50] he puts it in the sea of his gift
[1:41:51] forgiveness he doesn't even see it
[1:41:53] anymore
[1:41:54] it's white as snow the devil comes up
[1:41:56] he's the accuser of the brother hey do
[1:41:57] you know what your child did let me look
[1:42:00] let me look no
[1:42:03] i don't think so white of snow didn't do
[1:42:06] it
[1:42:06] didn't do it but he didn't do it he
[1:42:09] didn't no he didn't he confessed his
[1:42:10] sins
[1:42:11] amen i love the word of god justified in
[1:42:15] them that he justified he also glorified
[1:42:17] what shall we say to these things if god
[1:42:21] before us
[1:42:22] who could ever be against us isn't that
[1:42:25] a wonderful verse if god before us who
[1:42:27] could ever be against us
[1:42:28] so many other things i'm going to skip
[1:42:30] over for the sake of time brother
[1:42:32] uh brother nate dougal asked that we
[1:42:36] send some verses on salvation i got the
[1:42:38] whole romans road
[1:42:39] kind of goes through salvation there and
[1:42:41] then he that believeth and is baptized
[1:42:43] shall be saved
[1:42:44] and remember the philip the bible says
[1:42:46] he was transformed trans
[1:42:47] uh from samaria he went and he met the
[1:42:49] eunuch he got and he said he preached
[1:42:51] unto him jesus
[1:42:52] we got all done preaching jesus the
[1:42:54] philips the
[1:42:55] the eunuch said hey here's water what
[1:42:57] does hinder us
[1:42:58] so if you're going to preach jesus
[1:43:00] somewhere water baptism has got to be in
[1:43:01] there mark 16
[1:43:02] 16 he that believeth in is baptized
[1:43:04] shall be saved
[1:43:06] amen i was thinking about that not only
[1:43:07] that repent and be baptized and you
[1:43:09] shall
[1:43:10] be filled with the holy ghost amen
[1:43:13] i say we consider him so many things
[1:43:16] here i just feel
[1:43:17] for the sake of time that we're going to
[1:43:18] pass over i say we consider him for our
[1:43:20] salvation
[1:43:21] we consider him tonight for whatever
[1:43:23] you're going through consider the lord
[1:43:25] jesus
[1:43:26] this isn't the end amen your trials
[1:43:28] didn't come to destroy us it came to
[1:43:30] make us stronger
[1:43:31] amen it came to to believe in the lord
[1:43:33] for salvation i was thinking you
[1:43:35] take your boys out and you get out in
[1:43:37] the mud and you know you get along the
[1:43:38] road you get a flat tire somewhere
[1:43:40] 20 uh you're miles back in the bush you
[1:43:42] sit down your friend what are we going
[1:43:43] to do what are you going to do somebody
[1:43:44] walks along and said have you ever
[1:43:46] considered your spare tire
[1:43:48] oh yeah salvation where you put the
[1:43:51] spare tire
[1:43:52] on you go out i mean that's the way
[1:43:55] mankind was we were sitting along the
[1:43:56] road one day
[1:43:57] as sinners with no way to help her and
[1:44:00] god rich in mercy came by and picked us
[1:44:02] up
[1:44:03] i say we consider him in our own lives
[1:44:05] within considering for others
[1:44:08] amen born in sin shaped in iniquity but
[1:44:11] christ came and
[1:44:12] changed our life
[1:44:18] what about life after death so many
[1:44:20] people are selling these books life
[1:44:21] after death
[1:44:23] i said why don't you just get read a
[1:44:25] book that somebody had to experience in
[1:44:27] life after death
[1:44:29] jesus he said no man takes my life from
[1:44:31] me i lay it down i have power to lay it
[1:44:32] down i power to take it up and then he
[1:44:34] went on to say because i live
[1:44:36] you can live also you can live also
[1:44:39] oh there's so many blessings to be a
[1:44:41] christian one day here a few months ago
[1:44:43] i was
[1:44:44] we were selling roofs and i this man had
[1:44:47] a roof problem
[1:44:48] and i went over there just when i drove
[1:44:50] up started pouring down raining
[1:44:52] just pouring down so i had an umbrella
[1:44:54] here's the man's house he has an open
[1:44:56] garage there
[1:44:57] i get the umbrella out i'm like hey how
[1:44:59] you doing it's raining i'm like oh
[1:45:00] and we run over to the garage and now
[1:45:02] it's pouring down raining and i'm
[1:45:03] standing in the garage with this man
[1:45:05] as we're standing there just a minute we
[1:45:07] start talking about the
[1:45:08] the things and then he starts talking
[1:45:10] about death okay lord that's why we're
[1:45:12] here
[1:45:13] we're here because of this he starts
[1:45:15] talking he said you know i'm a pretty
[1:45:16] good person i
[1:45:17] but i said i feared death i see and he
[1:45:20] believed in reincarnation he said i i'm
[1:45:21] afraid because i've been a good person
[1:45:23] in life but i'm afraid i'll come back as
[1:45:25] another person
[1:45:26] and i'll pray i'm afraid that person
[1:45:28] will be evil and it'll be and so he just
[1:45:30] began to talk to him about the lord and
[1:45:32] how that is appointed unto man wants to
[1:45:34] die and christ died and
[1:45:36] rose again and he said because i live
[1:45:38] you can live also he said jesus said
[1:45:40] you know i'm going to go and prepare a
[1:45:42] place for you
[1:45:43] and this man he was really worried i
[1:45:45] might come back as an aunt or i might
[1:45:46] come back as
[1:45:47] a tarantula or i might come back as a
[1:45:50] bird and he was just really worried
[1:45:52] but jesus said i am going to go away and
[1:45:55] i'm going to
[1:45:55] come again and receive you unto myself
[1:45:57] that where i am you can be also
[1:46:00] i believe that what is that saint john
[1:46:02] 14 or 15 right in there
[1:46:04] he said i'm going to prepare a place for
[1:46:06] you i mean you might not have anything
[1:46:08] in this life
[1:46:09] but jesus is going to prepare a place
[1:46:11] for the believer
[1:46:13] and i began to talk about that i was
[1:46:15] thinking over in revelation just a
[1:46:16] couple more verses revelations chapter
[1:46:18] 21
[1:46:21] all these promises of god i love the
[1:46:23] scripture
[1:46:24] amen you might not have anything in life
[1:46:26] but if you have jesus christ you have
[1:46:27] everything
[1:46:29] you have the promises of god the bible
[1:46:31] says
[1:46:32] faith is a substance of things hoped for
[1:46:34] it's a substance
[1:46:36] i'd like to preach hebrews chapter 11
[1:46:38] right here but these verses
[1:46:39] revelations chapter 21 verse 3 and i
[1:46:42] heard a great voice
[1:46:44] out of heaven saying behold the
[1:46:45] tabernacle of god is with men
[1:46:47] and he shall dwell with them do you
[1:46:49] believe the word of god
[1:46:50] do you believe god's going to dwell with
[1:46:52] you brother man said he'll walk out to
[1:46:54] that
[1:46:55] marriage supper maybe thousands of miles
[1:46:57] long he'll walk down and he'll he'll
[1:46:59] wipe the tears from your eyes with those
[1:47:01] nail-scarred hands of five precious
[1:47:03] wounds
[1:47:04] only thing made in heaven the five
[1:47:05] precious wounds
[1:47:07] he goes on to say god will be with them
[1:47:08] and he shall dwell
[1:47:10] be his people and god himself shall be
[1:47:13] with them and be their god
[1:47:15] and god shall wipe away all of their
[1:47:18] tears
[1:47:21] you don't have to say if you cry
[1:47:22] sometimes your tears might be of your
[1:47:24] heart
[1:47:24] your heart's weeping sometimes it's
[1:47:27] expressed in your
[1:47:28] your eyes but the bible says he'll wipe
[1:47:30] away all your the tears from your eyes
[1:47:32] and there shall be no more death
[1:47:36] neither sorrow oh isn't that a good
[1:47:38] verse i've got a promise there's a deep
[1:47:40] calling to the deep
[1:47:41] there'll be no more sorrow nor crying
[1:47:44] neither shall there be any more
[1:47:45] pain for the former things are passed
[1:47:48] away
[1:47:49] he that sat upon their own throne said
[1:47:51] behold
[1:47:52] i make all things new it's all going to
[1:47:56] be new
[1:47:57] i've never had a new house i've never
[1:47:59] had a new car
[1:48:00] but jesus said i'm going i'm making
[1:48:01] everything new
[1:48:03] oh man i'm looking for a new body hey
[1:48:05] man i'm looking for a new body there
[1:48:07] won't be
[1:48:07] as you get older and older there'll be
[1:48:09] no surprise when your body changes
[1:48:11] i mean some of these young men are right
[1:48:12] in their prime and they're young and get
[1:48:14] their body and they get changed and
[1:48:15] you know they hey i'm 21 i'm 21. yeah
[1:48:18] but now this body i can walk through a
[1:48:20] wall
[1:48:20] bible says it does not appear what we
[1:48:22] shall be but we know when he shall
[1:48:24] appear we shall be like him
[1:48:26] and he ate the fish remember he appeared
[1:48:27] and he ate the fish and then he walked
[1:48:29] back through the wall
[1:48:30] as i said before the wall the the fish
[1:48:31] didn't hit the wall and slide down the
[1:48:33] wall
[1:48:33] somehow the fish became a part of that
[1:48:35] body oh praise god
[1:48:37] the bible says i have not seen ear had
[1:48:40] not heard
[1:48:41] it's neither entered into the heart of
[1:48:43] men the things that god has
[1:48:44] in store for them that believe and he
[1:48:47] says right here all things will be made
[1:48:48] new and he said to me right
[1:48:50] for these things are true and faithful
[1:48:53] i mean sometimes people pick up a book
[1:48:55] and they read it like oh that was just
[1:48:56] fiction was a bunch of nonsense
[1:48:58] why don't you read something that's true
[1:49:01] amen something that's faithful something
[1:49:02] that will help you
[1:49:04] praise the lord life after death amen i
[1:49:07] want a new body let's consider him
[1:49:10] as we just come to a close considering
[1:49:12] maybe for your healing
[1:49:13] brother rem said this he said that's
[1:49:16] then what about
[1:49:17] healing for the sick greater is he that
[1:49:19] is in you than
[1:49:20] the sickness because that's an
[1:49:23] interruption
[1:49:24] interrupting the very laws of god
[1:49:26] sicknesses
[1:49:28] so god has health and he has life and so
[1:49:31] what is sickness
[1:49:31] it's an interruption of god's program
[1:49:35] and he said well the greater is he that
[1:49:37] is in you
[1:49:38] that's the healer and the creator than
[1:49:40] the devil that's interrupting the very
[1:49:42] program of god in your life greater is
[1:49:44] he that is in you than he that is in the
[1:49:46] world
[1:49:46] i say lord you're greater now the first
[1:49:48] thing you've got to come on god's side
[1:49:50] some people like lord heal me are you a
[1:49:53] christian first because
[1:49:55] healing is the is the children's bread
[1:49:56] but if you're not on the lord's side
[1:49:58] then god has no obligation to you so
[1:50:02] the main thing is come over god may be
[1:50:03] using that to sickness to drive you to
[1:50:06] the place that you'll surrender to god
[1:50:08] and then when you surrender to god then
[1:50:10] god will clear up that sickness and all
[1:50:12] things are starting to work together for
[1:50:13] good to them that love god
[1:50:15] amen let's consider him life after death
[1:50:18] i tell this little story
[1:50:20] my grandmother was passing
[1:50:24] and i remember we went into her room
[1:50:27] and she was laying there and the bed and
[1:50:30] my grandfather already passed away and
[1:50:33] so she was laying there and she she was
[1:50:36] fading in and out of consciousness
[1:50:38] and she came to and she said you're
[1:50:40] talking a little bit she said i saw
[1:50:42] grandpa
[1:50:44] i was like oh you wonder you know what
[1:50:47] they're seeing and this
[1:50:48] and so my grandfather died he had black
[1:50:51] hair and turned gray
[1:50:53] had gray in it so i asked her i believe
[1:50:56] i'm bringing in a new body right
[1:50:58] the bible says it does not yet appear
[1:51:00] what we shall be but we know when we he
[1:51:02] we shall see him we shall be like him
[1:51:05] how's the bible say if this earthly
[1:51:06] tabernacle be dissolved we already have
[1:51:08] one
[1:51:08] waiting for it we just step over into
[1:51:10] that new body
[1:51:11] so i asked my grandmother she's laying
[1:51:13] there and i said grandma you said you
[1:51:15] saw grandfather she said yeah
[1:51:17] i said did he have gray hair or did he
[1:51:19] have black hair
[1:51:21] she said oh no he had black hair he was
[1:51:23] young again
[1:51:25] amen they get to that place and they
[1:51:27] stand in that little remember brother
[1:51:28] the ram goes beyond the curtain time he
[1:51:30] said i was standing in that little
[1:51:31] slanted place
[1:51:32] he said i looked there and saw my body
[1:51:34] he said i looked here and i saw
[1:51:37] millions and millions of believers
[1:51:39] running and new bodies and coming just
[1:51:41] in a little slanted place
[1:51:43] just in a little slanted place amen
[1:51:46] let's consider him today
[1:51:47] let's not be enticed by the things of
[1:51:49] the world and pulled aside and let
[1:51:50] something steal your faith
[1:51:52] we sing a little song back home don't
[1:51:54] let nobody steal your joy don't let
[1:51:56] anybody steal you don't let any
[1:51:57] situation
[1:51:58] don't like church problem family problem
[1:52:00] don't let it steal your joy the joy of
[1:52:02] the lord is our strength
[1:52:04] amen for for maybe you've got a
[1:52:06] financial need i say tonight consider
[1:52:07] jesus christ
[1:52:08] philippians 4 19 says but my god shall
[1:52:11] supply
[1:52:11] all of your needs according to his
[1:52:13] riches and glory maybe you're going to
[1:52:15] make a career
[1:52:16] move the bible says the footsteps of the
[1:52:18] righteous they're ordered by god
[1:52:21] they're ordered by god and everything
[1:52:23] all things work together for good to
[1:52:25] them that love
[1:52:26] god i was thinking about psalms 37
[1:52:30] 23 it says the steps of a good man are
[1:52:32] ordered by the lord and he delighteth in
[1:52:34] his way
[1:52:35] though he fall is anybody falling you
[1:52:38] don't have to raise your hand we all
[1:52:40] have made mistakes though he fall he
[1:52:42] shall not be utterly cast down
[1:52:44] for the lord upholdeth him with his hand
[1:52:47] there's peter he's going through a
[1:52:49] stormy time and and and
[1:52:51] jesus come be not afraid it is i be not
[1:52:53] injured peter said lord let you bid me
[1:52:55] come
[1:52:56] and what was jesus saying okay come walk
[1:52:58] a supernatural life
[1:52:59] come walk us through and peter steps out
[1:53:01] of the boat and starts walking a
[1:53:02] supernatural life which is what all of
[1:53:04] us
[1:53:05] are doing it's not natural for you to
[1:53:06] have a desire and lady you'll see it
[1:53:08] should be lukewarm and you just stayed
[1:53:10] home like the coffee it just becomes
[1:53:12] lukewarm but tonight
[1:53:13] you've desired to come in the house of
[1:53:14] the lord and not listen to a
[1:53:16] patty cake preacher but somebody that's
[1:53:18] cutting us by the word of god
[1:53:20] making a masterpiece and we're making
[1:53:21] ourselves ready and you're living a
[1:53:23] supernatural life whether you realize it
[1:53:25] or not
[1:53:26] and then peter got to looking around and
[1:53:29] and he got fearful and he got afraid and
[1:53:30] he started sinking
[1:53:32] but what did he do what all sons and
[1:53:34] daughters he said lord save me
[1:53:36] lord save me and jesus said no peter you
[1:53:39] should have made
[1:53:40] it you shouldn't even start it if you
[1:53:41] don't any man that's not willing to
[1:53:43] to what do you say count the cost and
[1:53:45] you just got your eyes on the world
[1:53:46] and you're seeking you deserve it no
[1:53:50] peter said lord save me and jesus did a
[1:53:52] second work in his life reached and got
[1:53:54] his hand and pulled him back up
[1:53:55] and the bible says and they both walk
[1:53:57] back to the ship
[1:53:58] they both started walking a supernatural
[1:54:00] life back to the ship
[1:54:02] you might feel like you're sinking feel
[1:54:03] like it's all falling apart just say
[1:54:05] lord save me

[1:54:28] it'll speak when you go home and
[1:54:30] keep speaking and speaking and it's the
[1:54:32] word of god
[1:54:35] proverbs 3 5 trust in the lord with all
[1:54:38] thine heart and lean not to thine own
[1:54:40] understanding
[1:54:41] in all thy ways acknowledge him or
[1:54:43] consider him
[1:54:44] and he shall direct thy path

[1:55:04] is lord some men will wait till then
[1:55:06] they'll curse god
