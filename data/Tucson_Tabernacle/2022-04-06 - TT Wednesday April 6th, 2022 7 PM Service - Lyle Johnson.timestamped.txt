[32:31] [Music]
[32:53] little
[32:54] bright rest
[32:56] for all is well
[33:01] thank you
[33:04] someone asked one of the children here
[33:07] about one of the times i spoke and was
[33:09] told he's the one that always says good
[33:11] evening
[33:12] i don't want to disappoint or be
[33:14] inconsistent so good evening
[33:17] being a wednesday night i'll try to keep
[33:20] this
[33:21] under three hours
[33:23] if if i go longer than that feel free to
[33:25] interrupt if the battery doesn't go dead
[33:27] in the microphone first
[33:30] i have to admit that i'm feeling really
[33:31] good tonight
[33:33] i've got something on my heart that i
[33:34] want to share with you from god's word
[33:37] and i want to share with you a brief
[33:38] testimony in the process of that as well
[33:41] i'm wondering if we could stand and
[33:45] approach the author
[33:47] not only of the bible but the author of
[33:48] our faith before
[33:50] i say something that i shouldn't
[33:53] lord jesus
[33:55] father god we are so in awe of you we
[33:58] are so grateful for this opportunity
[34:00] that we can have lord jesus to
[34:02] bask in your presence lord to shower you
[34:05] with the praises of our lips lord the
[34:08] love that's in our heart for you in
[34:10] response to the love that you had for us
[34:12] pray lord jesus that you would help me
[34:14] to just be out of the way lord forgive
[34:16] me of the sin in my life lord the
[34:19] unbelief the the places where i just so
[34:22] frequently and so often fall short that
[34:24] i can be out of the way and be a channel
[34:26] that you could speak because these are
[34:28] your people bought with your blood
[34:30] through that agony of suffering lord
[34:32] jesus pray lord that there'd be
[34:34] something here tonight that would help
[34:35] strengthen the faith of each and every
[34:37] person that's here
[34:38] we thank you for this opportunity to be
[34:40] together once more in jesus name amen
[34:48] see if i can remember how to make this
[34:50] work
[34:52] no
[34:53] yeah there we are
[34:58] while we're standing in respect to that
[35:00] written word and read our topic verses
[35:02] the first two
[35:04] are found in paul's epistle to the
[35:06] hebrews a letter he wrote to jewish
[35:07] believers
[35:09] both are very familiar to us we'll start
[35:11] with
[35:12] hebrews 11
[35:13] verse 1.
[35:14] we're told faith
[35:17] faith is a substance
[35:19] it's a substance of things that we hope
[35:21] for
[35:22] and it's evidence
[35:24] it's evidence
[35:25] of things we can't see
[35:28] and a bit earlier in that same letter
[35:29] paul said
[35:31] we have not a high priest he's speaking
[35:33] of jesus
[35:34] we have not a high priest that cannot be
[35:36] touched with the feeling of our
[35:38] infirmities in other words we have a
[35:40] high priest that can be touched by the
[35:43] feeling of our infirmities why because
[35:46] he was at all points
[35:48] tempted
[35:49] tested
[35:50] like as we are yet
[35:52] somehow
[35:54] without sin
[35:56] and finally we'll read four verses from
[35:59] his epistle to the galatians
[36:02] he says we who are jews by nature he's
[36:04] not necessarily speaking to a jewish
[36:06] audience but he's helping these this
[36:08] gentile audience understand a jewish
[36:10] perspective and not sinners of the
[36:13] gentiles knowing
[36:15] that a man is not justified
[36:17] by the works of the law
[36:20] but by the faith of jesus christ
[36:23] even we have believed in jesus christ
[36:26] that we might be justified by the faith
[36:29] of christ
[36:30] not by the works of the law for by the
[36:32] works of the law shall no flesh be
[36:34] justified
[36:36] skipping down to verse 20 he says
[36:38] i am crucified with christ
[36:41] nevertheless i live
[36:44] yet not i
[36:46] but christ lives in me
[36:48] and the life which i now live in this
[36:50] flesh i live by the faith of the son of
[36:53] god who loved me
[36:55] gave himself
[36:57] for me
[36:59] i don't frustrate the grace of god for
[37:00] if righteousness come by the law then
[37:03] christ is dead in vain
[37:06] please be seated
[37:10] tonight
[37:11] i want to speak about faith
[37:14] we often wrestle with faith in our daily
[37:17] lives i i certainly do
[37:19] to me it's part of the very fabric of
[37:21] being a christian faith
[37:23] and the struggles within ourselves
[37:25] regarding that faith
[37:28] in his healing ministry brother branham
[37:31] was always encouraging each of us to
[37:33] have faith
[37:35] the ministry that he had the discernment
[37:37] of speaking to the people and revealing
[37:38] things about them that he couldn't
[37:40] possibly know
[37:41] was for the purpose of increasing their
[37:43] faith
[37:48] his commission was to pray for the sick
[37:52] a gift of healing
[37:54] he was told if you can get the people to
[37:56] believe you
[37:58] nothing will stand before your prayers
[38:00] not even cancer
[38:03] belief
[38:05] faith
[38:07] not to believe in brother branham or
[38:10] even in his prayer for them which was
[38:11] often as simple as as
[38:14] lord jesus heal the woman
[38:16] now go on your way rejoicing you're
[38:18] healed
[38:19] not long complicated petitions
[38:23] to have them place their faith in jesus
[38:25] christ as jehovah rapha
[38:27] god the healer
[38:30] remember a couple of weeks ago we spoke
[38:32] about confession
[38:35] jesus is lord
[38:36] four syllables three words that
[38:38] encapsulate
[38:40] the whole of christianity
[38:43] i'd like to share a testimony
[38:45] an update
[38:46] of god's healing power in our midst
[38:49] some of you may recall that thanksgiving
[38:51] week of 2017 was a
[38:54] a medically stressful week for me
[38:57] i started the week on monday with an
[38:58] emergency appendectomy
[39:00] i ended on friday with a massive heart
[39:03] attack
[39:04] completely shutting off the blood supply
[39:06] to the right side of my heart 100
[39:08] blockage
[39:10] by mid to late december my heart had
[39:12] recovered to about a 60 to 65 percent
[39:15] level of its normal pre-attack capacity
[39:19] it stayed at that level
[39:21] it stayed until
[39:23] one wednesday evening four years ago
[39:27] when god touched me i was sitting just a
[39:29] couple rows behind you here sister
[39:32] there wasn't any shouting there wasn't
[39:34] any prayer line he just asked me to
[39:36] praise him
[39:39] well heather and i saw the evidence of
[39:40] that healing the following sunday
[39:43] i didn't run out of air during the song
[39:45] service
[39:46] much to the dismay of those that were
[39:48] nearby
[39:50] well that tuesday
[39:52] i had an electrocardiogram now they
[39:54] weren't checking to see if i was
[39:55] pregnant i i wasn't but but to measure
[39:58] the capacity of my heart
[40:00] see how it performed
[40:02] and how it performed under stress
[40:05] afterwards the cardiologist told me mr
[40:08] johnson i can see no difference between
[40:11] your heart and a normal healthy heart
[40:14] see you in six months
[40:16] that was april of 2018.
[40:20] well monday of this week
[40:22] april of 2022 i went in for another
[40:25] stress test
[40:27] frankly i was mildly concerned because
[40:30] i'd noticed a lessening of my stamina in
[40:32] recent months
[40:34] couldn't be my age it's got to be my
[40:36] heart right
[40:38] the result of the testing
[40:40] and an answer to a specific question i
[40:42] asked to the doctor
[40:44] is that my heart is perfectly normal
[40:46] it performs well under stress
[40:49] i think heather will agree that the
[40:50] cardiologist a different one that we saw
[40:52] four years ago but part of the same
[40:54] medical practice was
[40:55] mildly surprised and certainly pleased
[40:59] so was i
[41:01] in other words
[41:03] the touch from the lord 48 months ago is
[41:06] still the touch from the lord this very
[41:08] evening
[41:10] he's faithful
[41:11] he keeps his promises
[41:14] he's ever present he's not stuck
[41:15] somewhere in the past or waiting for us
[41:18] somewhere in the future he's the great i
[41:21] am
[41:23] and
[41:24] an implication of this is you're
[41:26] probably stuck with me for a little
[41:27] while longer
[41:29] well back to our topic of faith
[41:31] let's reread there from galatians
[41:34] 2 16
[41:36] knowing that a man is not justified by
[41:39] the works of the law
[41:41] but by the faith of jesus christ
[41:45] even we have believed in jesus christ
[41:47] that we might be justified by the faith
[41:50] of christ
[41:52] not by the works of the law for
[41:54] by the works of the law shall no flesh
[41:56] be justified i was struck by the phrase
[41:59] we read here
[42:00] it's occurs in many places in the king
[42:02] james version
[42:04] the faith of
[42:06] jesus christ
[42:08] it's a matter of a preposition of rather
[42:10] than in
[42:12] we place our faith in him
[42:15] as a result of the exercise of his faith
[42:19] on our behalf
[42:22] the faith of jesus christ
[42:25] i've highlighted it here
[42:28] here's a brief explanation uh regarding
[42:30] the meaning of the word of from
[42:33] learngrammar.net it says of expresses
[42:36] the relationship of a part of something
[42:39] to the whole
[42:41] it's the most often used preposition in
[42:43] english examples he's a boy of 15.
[42:46] some parts of his body were injured
[42:49] most of the guests are gone
[42:52] the plays of shakespeare will always be
[42:54] classics
[42:57] we often talk about the blood of jesus
[43:00] the love of jesus
[43:03] but what about the faith of jesus
[43:06] tonight
[43:07] we're going to look a little bit at the
[43:09] faith of
[43:10] christ
[43:13] man is not justified by the works of
[43:15] love but by the faith of jesus christ
[43:17] what does that mean
[43:19] even we have believed in jesus christ
[43:21] that we might be justified by the faith
[43:24] of
[43:24] christ not by the works of the law
[43:29] i'm going to ask you a question
[43:32] no
[43:32] i'm going to ask you several questions
[43:34] you don't have to answer
[43:35] don't raise your hand it's okay
[43:38] do you think god has faith
[43:41] do you think god needs faith
[43:45] does he doubt that he can heal
[43:47] or save
[43:49] or create
[43:51] do you think it's hard for him to do
[43:53] that that he has to struggle to believe
[43:55] he can do it
[43:57] do you think he's learning
[43:59] discovering things about us that he
[44:01] never knew
[44:03] never anticipated
[44:05] things about himself
[44:08] does he get sick
[44:10] does he have migraines
[44:13] is he worried about covet 19
[44:17] i think we can agree that he's god
[44:20] he doesn't change
[44:23] he knows the end from the beginning
[44:26] not one of his will be lost
[44:29] he is our healer he is our savior he is
[44:31] our redeemer he is the lover of our
[44:33] souls
[44:35] we might think of this as some level as
[44:37] divine self-confidence
[44:39] true
[44:42] and we
[44:43] can have faith in him
[44:45] and his ability
[44:47] confidence
[44:49] and his love for us
[44:51] still with me
[44:53] now the question
[44:54] that brings our focus to this evening
[44:57] what was the faith of jesus christ
[45:02] that paul refers to if if he was god the
[45:06] the yahweh the yudeva the the jehovah of
[45:09] the old testament
[45:11] why did he need to have faith
[45:16] divine self-confidence
[45:18] but if that's the case
[45:21] how is he like us
[45:24] just god in the body form
[45:27] of course he passed all the tests he had
[45:29] the ultimate answer sheet
[45:31] no need for cliff notes right
[45:34] but it's not that simple
[45:36] and in fact i don't believe that that
[45:38] was the case in this sense
[45:42] consider
[45:44] jesus was born
[45:46] a helpless infant last week heather and
[45:48] i were in um
[45:50] in reno and and by
[45:52] god's arrangement we happened to be
[45:54] there the very moment that our second
[45:57] great-granddaughter was born
[45:59] six pounds 1.9 ounces
[46:03] a helpless infant
[46:05] totally dependent on his mother for life
[46:09] she nursed him
[46:11] she bathed him
[46:13] hugged him
[46:14] sang to him
[46:17] held him while he was circumcised and
[46:19] screamed out in pain
[46:21] put up with him when he was cutting
[46:22] teeth and got cranky and cried because
[46:24] he hurt and didn't know why
[46:27] soothed him
[46:29] comforted him
[46:30] held him when he fell down and cut his
[46:33] knee
[46:34] trimmed his finger nails and toenails
[46:36] cleaned him when he dirtied himself she
[46:38] was a mother
[46:40] and he was her firstborn infant
[46:44] jesus became a toddler
[46:47] small child
[46:48] continued to grow as any child might
[46:51] luke tells us that the child jesus grew
[46:55] waxed strong in spirit
[46:57] filled with wisdom
[47:00] and the grace of god was upon him
[47:05] the grace of god was what is grace
[47:10] unmerited favor
[47:12] modern did you ever think of jesus in
[47:14] this way
[47:16] but the bible says the grace of god was
[47:19] upon him
[47:25] i want you to exercise your imagination
[47:27] with me for a little while this evening
[47:31] today april 6th is brother branham's
[47:33] birthday
[47:35] in 1909 113 years ago in a remote part
[47:39] of kentucky
[47:40] he was born in a little cabin to a dirt
[47:43] poor family
[47:45] we're told a light came into the room
[47:47] when he was born
[47:49] now brother bradman didn't see it or or
[47:52] if he did he couldn't remember it
[47:54] right what's your earliest memory do you
[47:56] remember
[47:57] you may remember many birthdays but do
[47:59] you remember the day you were born
[48:02] no
[48:03] but his mother told him about it that's
[48:06] how he knew
[48:07] he relates this to us many times in the
[48:09] recordings that we have
[48:13] jesus growing up if he was human
[48:16] had no memory of an angel chorus
[48:17] celebrating in the skies no recollection
[48:21] of shepherds hurrying to the sheep stall
[48:23] where he was born
[48:25] no memory of simeon or anna prophesying
[48:27] over him in the temple
[48:29] at the age of only several months he
[48:31] would not have recalled a visit by some
[48:33] astrologers from the parthian empire
[48:35] bearing expensive gifts for him
[48:39] do you remember much before your first
[48:41] birthday
[48:43] i don't
[48:44] he might have had child member childhood
[48:46] memories of egypt we don't know how long
[48:49] the family stayed there
[48:51] i have a couple of fragmentary memories
[48:53] from when i lived in belmont california
[48:54] in a house that we left when i was three
[48:56] years old
[48:58] those are my earliest memories
[49:00] but we can be sure
[49:02] that mary told him about her being
[49:05] visited by an angel
[49:06] and now he was a special little boy
[49:10] of course every mother
[49:12] tells her children that they're special
[49:13] heather still tells our kids and they're
[49:15] all in their 40s
[49:17] i happen to agree with her
[49:19] but his his dad his his his stepdad his
[49:23] earthly dad joseph probably told him
[49:25] about spiritual dreams that he'd had and
[49:26] acted upon but
[49:28] nothing like the physical visit of an
[49:30] angel that mary had
[49:33] what would have been like
[49:35] to have been the young jesus
[49:39] or the young william branham for that
[49:41] matter
[49:42] hearing these amazing birth event
[49:44] stories
[49:46] i want your sisters to imagine this too
[49:50] in fact this may help you i want to
[49:51] share something brother branham said
[49:54] before i read it to you i'm going to ask
[49:56] you another question we're playing 20
[49:57] questions matt i'm going to ask you
[49:58] another question
[50:00] don't speak out if you think you know
[50:01] the answer
[50:02] don't even have to raise your hand but i
[50:04] want to give you some background to that
[50:05] question
[50:06] brother branham tells us that
[50:09] he has a child
[50:11] and that the the child recently saw a
[50:14] first vision
[50:16] he says he believed that child might
[50:17] take his place someday
[50:20] with me i'm paraphrasing
[50:22] i'm not quoting
[50:24] do you recall hearing him say something
[50:26] like that
[50:28] okay if you do just hold in your mind
[50:31] for a moment the name of that child
[50:33] don't don't speak it
[50:35] just oh yeah i know that was that's keep
[50:37] that in your mind now i'm going to read
[50:39] something to you it's from a message
[50:42] divine love it was preached in the
[50:44] spring of
[50:45] 1957.
[50:48] brother peter sister lydia it was march
[50:51] 5th that it was preached
[50:53] he's talking about a time that a sick
[50:55] opossum came to his porch in indiana and
[50:57] he couldn't decide what to do about it
[51:00] he says all night long i couldn't get
[51:02] that opossum off my mind
[51:05] the next morning early i went out and as
[51:08] i started out little rebecca who i
[51:10] believe is going to maybe take my place
[51:12] someday
[51:14] she's seen her first vision just
[51:16] recently
[51:17] and she's very tender-hearted little
[51:19] thing
[51:22] now here's my question you don't have to
[51:24] answer it is his daughter rebecca the
[51:26] child you thought of before i read that
[51:28] quote
[51:31] does it surprise you
[51:34] brother branham said that the angel told
[51:36] him his was a gift of healing
[51:39] one of the nine spiritual gifts he said
[51:41] healing faith wisdom prophecy
[51:42] discernment and so forth he wasn't
[51:45] talking about rebecca preaching
[51:47] the context is healing
[51:50] so please sisters
[51:52] join in our little exercise of imagining
[51:54] this agenda trying to place yourself in
[51:57] jesus sandals for a moment
[52:01] at age 12
[52:03] jesus is reasoning with the scholars and
[52:05] rabbis in the temple
[52:07] it's passover so it's near his birthday
[52:09] if he was born in mid april 6 bc as the
[52:12] evidence suggests then
[52:14] this would have been 8 a.d when he was
[52:16] 12 passover fell that year on what we
[52:19] would call march 20th
[52:21] he would have had bar mitzvah a few
[52:22] weeks after that passover in 880 when he
[52:24] became 13 years old
[52:28] from the angel announcing his birth
[52:30] until his baptism
[52:32] we have no record of jesus being visited
[52:35] by an angel
[52:36] or even having a spiritual dream it
[52:38] doesn't mean those things never happened
[52:40] only that we have no record
[52:43] either way
[52:45] we know almost nothing of his childhood
[52:47] or his early adulthood prior to his
[52:49] ministry
[52:51] we've seen sunday school pictures of a
[52:53] smiling lad helping his dad in a wood
[52:55] shop
[52:56] it's based on joseph being a skilled
[52:58] laborer in the greek word for skilled
[53:00] labor can also mean carpenter
[53:03] the king james version translates it as
[53:05] carpenter we have a whole church
[53:07] tradition of jesus helping his dad in a
[53:09] carpenter shop
[53:10] making furniture and whatnot for the
[53:12] locals as a kid seeing these kind of
[53:14] pictures in the sunday school that i
[53:16] attended
[53:18] denominational churches i wondered if
[53:20] any of that furniture was still around
[53:22] i wanted to see it
[53:24] i wanted to touch it
[53:27] well later in his early ministry the the
[53:30] locals were asking
[53:32] is not this the carpenter that's what
[53:34] the gospel of mark says or the
[53:35] carpenter's son as matthew tells it now
[53:38] i'm not suggesting he was not a
[53:40] carpenter or a woodworker the point of
[53:42] the locals of course is that he was not
[53:44] trained as a rabbi he was not trained as
[53:46] a student of the torah
[53:50] yet in his parables
[53:53] he never uses a carpenter metaphor apart
[53:55] from maybe talking about getting the
[53:57] beam out of your eye before you take the
[53:59] speck out of someone else's
[54:00] he uses farming
[54:02] agriculture
[54:04] milling
[54:05] grapes
[54:07] fishing
[54:08] talks about weddings
[54:11] we don't know when joseph died
[54:13] would you know that no mention is ever
[54:15] made of him after jesus encounter with
[54:17] the religious teachers there in the
[54:18] temple at age 12.
[54:22] brother branham tells us of his own
[54:24] childhood
[54:25] of whirlwinds and so forth that scared
[54:27] him or interfered with him he was about
[54:29] to do something that he shouldn't
[54:32] things he just couldn't understand at
[54:33] that time
[54:34] and didn't
[54:36] until many years later remember we're
[54:39] trying to understand some things about
[54:41] jesus
[54:42] how his life
[54:43] relates to our lives
[54:45] trying to get to the bottom of the
[54:47] phrase
[54:48] the faith of
[54:50] jesus and i want to underscore for you
[54:54] his humanity
[54:56] not his divinity
[54:58] his humanity
[55:00] both aspects are vitally important but
[55:02] we often overlook or even minimize
[55:05] humanity you're trying to split them
[55:06] into half man and half god well of
[55:08] course he could do that he was god
[55:11] but not tonight
[55:13] i want you to remember that he was fully
[55:16] human
[55:18] yet in him
[55:19] throughout the fullness of the godhead
[55:21] bodily
[55:23] john the baptist testified before jesus
[55:26] came to be baptized john the baptist
[55:28] answered we read in luke saying unto
[55:31] them all i indeed baptize you with water
[55:34] but one mightier than i is coming
[55:38] i can't even
[55:39] take his shoes off his feet i can't even
[55:42] be the foot wash flunky for him
[55:44] he shall baptize you
[55:47] with the holy ghost
[55:49] and with fire
[55:52] now at his baptism
[55:54] we're told of the holy spirit appearing
[55:57] descending
[55:58] a voice speaking
[56:00] i've threaded some gospel accounts
[56:03] together here to help us get a more
[56:04] complete picture of these moments to
[56:06] have multiple witnessing accounts
[56:11] i've color-coded it like i did a couple
[56:14] of weeks ago it came to pass in those
[56:16] days that jesus came from nazareth of
[56:19] galilee to jordan unto john to be
[56:21] baptized of him
[56:24] now when all the people were baptized it
[56:26] came to pass that jesus was also being
[56:29] baptized of john and jordan and praying
[56:32] and straightway
[56:34] coming out of the water
[56:36] he saw the heavens opened unto him
[56:39] he saw the spirit of god the holy ghost
[56:43] descending in bodily form like a dove
[56:46] and lighting upon him
[56:49] we just go to mark because they say the
[56:51] same thing there came a voice from
[56:52] heaven
[56:54] saying
[56:55] thou art my beloved son
[56:58] in whom i am well pleased
[57:02] now john's gospel tells us it wasn't
[57:04] only jesus that saw this
[57:07] jesus may have been the only one that
[57:08] heard the voice we don't have an
[57:10] additional testimony about that but in
[57:12] john 1 we read john the baptist bear
[57:15] record saying
[57:16] i saw the spirit descending from heaven
[57:19] like a dove and it abode upon him same
[57:21] thing jesus saw
[57:23] i knew him not but he that sent me to
[57:25] baptize with water the same said to me
[57:27] upon whom thou shalt see the spirit
[57:29] descending
[57:31] and remaining on him
[57:33] the same is he
[57:34] which baptizes with the holy ghost
[57:38] and i
[57:38] saw and bare record this is the son of
[57:41] god
[57:43] and of course this happened this
[57:44] prophecy the baptizing with the holy
[57:46] ghost and fire we know that happened at
[57:47] pentecost after the past after the
[57:50] passion
[57:51] the crucifixion the resurrection
[57:55] well if you were jesus the man the human
[58:00] why would this testimony be important to
[58:02] you that john also saw this
[58:06] might it be a reassurance that what you
[58:08] saw and experienced wasn't just a result
[58:10] of emotion or whatever the devil might
[58:12] try to get you to think to cast doubt on
[58:14] that experience somehow
[58:17] haven't you ever had times when you've
[58:19] had to fight doubt about something
[58:21] spiritual in your life
[58:23] isn't that how people lost their healing
[58:25] and other victories in christ we hear
[58:27] about and recorded messages of brother
[58:28] ranu
[58:30] but if someone else is there to remind
[58:32] and reinforce
[58:34] doesn't that make a difference for you
[58:37] this is in part why we need to confess
[58:40] our faults one to another
[58:42] not only to have accountability
[58:45] but also to bring reinforcement one more
[58:47] week
[58:48] bear one another's burdens and so
[58:50] fulfill the law of christ
[58:53] how can we do that if we're kept in
[58:54] ignorance of each other's burdens not
[58:57] just prayer requests
[58:58] but confession
[59:02] again
[59:03] consider the human being
[59:05] jesus
[59:07] no record of angel visitations
[59:10] your mom tells you that you're special
[59:12] just like all moms tell their sons
[59:14] you've heard about some odd things
[59:16] around your birth and sojourn in egypt
[59:18] is a very small child you you find you
[59:20] have a real knack for the scriptures
[59:23] somewhere along the line
[59:25] you started to connect the dots
[59:28] you're very familiar with the story of
[59:30] joseph and the torah and genesis you
[59:33] might see a breadcrumb trail there that
[59:35] helps you understand where you are
[59:37] who you are
[59:39] revelation
[59:40] understanding
[59:42] by faith
[59:44] but but are you really god hiding in a
[59:47] body and not really human or
[59:50] are you in fact a human
[59:53] consider
[59:54] immediately after jesus was baptized
[59:59] luke 4 we read in jesus
[1:00:01] being full of the holy ghost this is
[1:00:03] right after his baptism it had just
[1:00:05] delighted on him
[1:00:07] according to john the baptist testimony
[1:00:09] it remained with him
[1:00:11] jesus returned from jordan and was led
[1:00:14] by the spirit
[1:00:15] mark says he was driven by the spirit
[1:00:18] into the wilderness
[1:00:20] being 40 days tempted of the devil
[1:00:24] and in those days he did eat nothing and
[1:00:26] when they were ended he afterward
[1:00:28] hungered
[1:00:31] we usually focus on the temptation being
[1:00:33] after the 40 days of fasting and
[1:00:35] wandering in the wilderness
[1:00:37] but matthew mark and luke make it very
[1:00:40] clear he was being tested during those
[1:00:43] 40
[1:00:44] lonely
[1:00:45] torturous
[1:00:46] difficult days
[1:00:49] the devil didn't wait for 40 days and
[1:00:50] then show up
[1:00:52] the events that transpired the end that
[1:00:54] we read about stones and temples and
[1:00:57] kingdoms are just that
[1:00:59] the concluding events
[1:01:02] can you imagine the struggles you may
[1:01:04] have had during that time
[1:01:08] what struggles might you have had
[1:01:12] where's the battleground of our faith
[1:01:15] it's in our minds
[1:01:18] where was jesus battle being fought if
[1:01:19] he's just like us
[1:01:21] if he was a human being and just had a
[1:01:23] tremendous spiritual experience
[1:01:26] i'm not saying that he would doubt but
[1:01:27] i'm sure that things came along and
[1:01:30] lord i know that's in your word where is
[1:01:32] that it's not i doubt that it's in your
[1:01:34] word it's not sin it's not
[1:01:36] doubt but it's a tremendous testing it's
[1:01:39] a tremendous struggle
[1:01:41] what brother branham's case what did he
[1:01:43] finally do
[1:01:45] he went to a cave and asked god to show
[1:01:47] him what all these strange things in his
[1:01:49] life meant
[1:01:51] and this was years after his ohio river
[1:01:53] experience
[1:01:56] remember we're looking at jesus humanity
[1:02:00] because we're talking about faith
[1:02:02] i can't relate to god wrapped in flesh
[1:02:04] and see how that is somehow the same is
[1:02:06] or even similar to me in my trials and
[1:02:09] testings of life
[1:02:11] and they have a divine spark
[1:02:13] and i do claim to have a portion of the
[1:02:15] spirit of the almighty
[1:02:17] but that's different
[1:02:19] than possessing the whole of the divine
[1:02:22] being
[1:02:24] i really like that the greek word for
[1:02:26] tempted means tested as well as enticed
[1:02:29] and examined
[1:02:31] because when we're tempted
[1:02:33] isn't that the case
[1:02:34] enticement
[1:02:36] and testing
[1:02:38] like all good tests it isn't to inform
[1:02:40] the teacher what we know
[1:02:42] but help us understand our grasp
[1:02:45] of the material being covered by the
[1:02:47] test
[1:02:49] the difference
[1:02:51] jesus passed the tests
[1:02:53] without sin
[1:02:55] me
[1:02:56] not so much
[1:02:59] let's look at another aspect that shows
[1:03:01] jesus humanity
[1:03:04] not just god wrapped in a body mark 4.
[1:03:08] jesus is just starting his ministry here
[1:03:11] he's back in his hometown of nazareth
[1:03:14] jesus said unto them a prophet is not
[1:03:17] without honor
[1:03:18] but in his own country
[1:03:20] and among his own kin
[1:03:23] and
[1:03:24] in his own house
[1:03:26] and we're told he could do there no
[1:03:27] mighty work
[1:03:29] saved that he laid his hands upon a few
[1:03:31] sick folk and healed them
[1:03:34] and he marveled because of their
[1:03:36] unbelief
[1:03:38] and he went round about the village's
[1:03:41] teaching
[1:03:43] he marveled
[1:03:45] let's read in matthew chapter eight
[1:03:49] when jesus was entered into kefarnakum
[1:03:51] there came unto him a centurion
[1:03:55] that's a roman
[1:03:56] soldier the occupier
[1:03:59] the enemy
[1:04:01] besieging him and saying lord
[1:04:04] now this is a roman military guy
[1:04:08] he's addressing jesus as lord
[1:04:11] my servant
[1:04:12] my jewish slave
[1:04:14] lies at home
[1:04:16] sick of the palsy
[1:04:17] grievously tormented
[1:04:20] and jesus said unto him i'll i'll come
[1:04:22] and heal him the centurion answered and
[1:04:25] said lord
[1:04:26] i'm not worthy that thou should come
[1:04:28] under my roof
[1:04:29] he was aware of the jewish prohibition
[1:04:32] regarding gentiles we're told in another
[1:04:34] account that this particular century was
[1:04:36] well regarded in the local jewish
[1:04:38] community
[1:04:40] but speak the word only and my servant
[1:04:42] shall be healed
[1:04:45] i'm a man under authority
[1:04:48] and i have soldiers under me
[1:04:50] i say to this man go
[1:04:52] he goes to nether come
[1:04:55] he comes to my servant
[1:04:58] do this
[1:04:59] and he does it
[1:05:01] when jesus heard it he marveled
[1:05:05] he marveled
[1:05:07] and said to them that followed verily i
[1:05:09] say to you
[1:05:11] i often found this kind of faith in all
[1:05:13] of israel
[1:05:16] he marveled
[1:05:17] he was astonished
[1:05:20] he was amazed
[1:05:23] god
[1:05:24] can you astonish god
[1:05:27] can you surprise him
[1:05:29] god it's your birthday i've got a
[1:05:30] surprise for you guess what it is in the
[1:05:32] box you can't you can't surprise god he
[1:05:34] knows the end from the beginning if he's
[1:05:36] all-knowing how could these two
[1:05:38] circumstances cause amazement
[1:05:40] or even mild surprise but but to a man
[1:05:44] yeah
[1:05:46] yeah
[1:05:47] i want to shift gears for for just a
[1:05:49] moment here
[1:05:52] over the years
[1:05:54] i've had the blessing and opportunity
[1:05:56] to have my path cross out of brother al
[1:05:58] pedersen
[1:06:00] he's told me many times of some of his
[1:06:03] experiences with brother random's
[1:06:04] ministry
[1:06:06] one of the things he often told me
[1:06:09] was that brother branham's life his
[1:06:11] ministry was
[1:06:12] so close
[1:06:14] to that of jesus not that he was jesus
[1:06:16] but was so close
[1:06:20] that's right probably jordan i imagine
[1:06:22] you've heard him use that very those
[1:06:24] terms so close
[1:06:26] that's the word that he uses when he
[1:06:27] talks to me about it for a while it was
[1:06:30] so close
[1:06:33] now i often wondered what was wrong with
[1:06:35] the people that we refer to as a deity
[1:06:37] believers the ones who think brother
[1:06:39] branham was god they pray to him they
[1:06:41] worship him
[1:06:43] brother branham spoke against this so
[1:06:44] strongly but they choose to brush that
[1:06:46] away as just a smoke screen and persist
[1:06:49] in their ways
[1:06:51] i think they have in a
[1:06:54] kind of a twisted sort of way a glimpse
[1:06:56] of something
[1:06:57] but they're not understanding it and
[1:06:59] that something is what they perceive as
[1:07:01] divinity in brother branham
[1:07:04] but i believe they're misinterpreting is
[1:07:06] the humanity of jesus christ
[1:07:09] they see a ministry that's been hidden
[1:07:11] for two millennia
[1:07:12] they recognize it as the spirit of
[1:07:14] christ
[1:07:15] but they can't separate the human from
[1:07:17] the divine
[1:07:19] they simply can't recognize that
[1:07:21] although brother branham had a unique
[1:07:22] gift
[1:07:23] he was a man with a gift
[1:07:26] a human being one who was once a sinner
[1:07:29] saved by grace and faith in jesus christ
[1:07:33] rather than worship him
[1:07:35] they should be trying to imitate him not
[1:07:37] his ministry his faith
[1:07:40] his walk
[1:07:42] as should we all
[1:07:45] and isn't that what god was trying to
[1:07:47] show us through his ministry
[1:07:50] if you can get the people to believe you
[1:07:52] not to believe in you
[1:07:54] but believe what you're telling them
[1:07:56] what did he say operated that gift
[1:07:59] that healing gift
[1:08:01] was our faith not his
[1:08:04] well back to the humanity of jesus
[1:08:08] to the faith of
[1:08:10] jesus
[1:08:12] what is faith anyway
[1:08:15] brother daniel preached so effectively
[1:08:17] last sunday morning it's it's based on
[1:08:19] hope
[1:08:21] i don't think any of us will forget
[1:08:22] about the rat swimming
[1:08:25] paul tells us
[1:08:30] we in romans 8 24 we are saved by hope
[1:08:34] but hope that is seen as not hope
[1:08:38] for what a man sees
[1:08:40] why does he yet hope for
[1:08:43] and one of the first verses we read this
[1:08:45] evening hebrews 11 1 faith is a
[1:08:47] substance
[1:08:49] of things hoped
[1:08:50] for the evidence of things
[1:08:53] not
[1:08:54] seen
[1:08:57] let me share with you two other
[1:08:58] translations
[1:09:00] how they rendered this verse for from
[1:09:01] the complete jewish bible we read
[1:09:05] trusting is being confident
[1:09:08] of what we hope for
[1:09:10] convinced
[1:09:11] about things we do not see
[1:09:14] convinced
[1:09:16] without doubt
[1:09:18] fully assured
[1:09:20] next is from the amplified bible
[1:09:24] now faith is the assurance
[1:09:27] the confirmation
[1:09:29] the title deed
[1:09:30] of the things we hope for
[1:09:33] being the proof of things we do not see
[1:09:36] and the conviction of their reality
[1:09:40] faith perceiving is real fact
[1:09:42] what is not revealed to the senses
[1:09:45] brother branham talks about faith the
[1:09:47] sixth sense
[1:09:49] and we're trying to look at this from
[1:09:50] the perspective
[1:09:52] of the faith of christ
[1:09:56] so what was his hope
[1:09:58] what was the unseen thing that he was
[1:10:01] convinced of
[1:10:03] that in the end
[1:10:05] and the final analysis
[1:10:07] made the way for us
[1:10:09] that could only come through him
[1:10:12] only by him
[1:10:14] acting
[1:10:15] on his faith
[1:10:22] come with me to his final night on earth
[1:10:23] and his physical body
[1:10:25] after all we're just about a week or so
[1:10:27] away from the anniversary of that
[1:10:29] fateful night
[1:10:30] these are familiar scriptures to us all
[1:10:32] we'll read from luke's account
[1:10:35] luke 22 39 and and jesus came out
[1:10:39] and went as he did so often to the mount
[1:10:42] of
[1:10:42] olives his disciples also followed him
[1:10:47] and when he was at the place he said to
[1:10:49] them pray
[1:10:51] that she and are not into temptation
[1:10:54] that you don't have a test like i'm
[1:10:55] about to have
[1:10:58] and he was withdrawn from them about a
[1:10:59] stone's cast and kneeled down and prayed
[1:11:04] saying father
[1:11:06] if thou be willing
[1:11:08] remove this cup from me.
[1:11:12] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[1:11:15] done
[1:11:17] not my will
[1:11:19] that's jesus the man
[1:11:22] this whole prayer this whole episode is
[1:11:24] jesus the man
[1:11:26] faith
[1:11:28] faithfulness
[1:11:29] obedience
[1:11:32] and there appeared an angel unto him
[1:11:34] from heaven
[1:11:35] strengthening him
[1:11:37] and being in an agony he prayed more
[1:11:40] earnestly
[1:11:42] it's hard to fathom how his prayer could
[1:11:44] be anything but earnest
[1:11:46] but he was in deep travail of his soul
[1:11:50] his sweat was as it were great drops of
[1:11:52] blood falling down to the ground
[1:11:55] and when he rose up from prayer and was
[1:11:57] come to his disciples
[1:11:59] he found them
[1:12:00] sleeping for sorrow
[1:12:03] said unto them
[1:12:05] why sleepy
[1:12:07] rise and pray lest she enter into
[1:12:10] temptation
[1:12:11] another version says watch and pray
[1:12:14] that you might avoid this kind of
[1:12:16] testing
[1:12:18] jesus the man
[1:12:20] knew
[1:12:21] that a horror awaited him
[1:12:24] he'd seen people crucified from time to
[1:12:26] time throughout his life
[1:12:28] heard their cries
[1:12:30] saw their unspeakable agony
[1:12:33] gethsemane was not only his submission
[1:12:36] to god's will
[1:12:37] it was to be the preface to his ultimate
[1:12:40] test of faith
[1:12:41] and as a result that was his ultimate
[1:12:44] expression of his faith
[1:12:48] he awaits his arrest and cruel execution
[1:12:50] remember faith
[1:12:52] is based on hope
[1:12:54] of something never seen
[1:12:59] what was that which was unseen
[1:13:03] what was jesus faith
[1:13:06] well let's read from john 10.
[1:13:09] he says i am the good shepherd
[1:13:11] and know my sheep and am known of mine
[1:13:14] as the father knows me even so i know
[1:13:17] the father
[1:13:18] and i lay down my life for the sheep
[1:13:21] and other sheep i have which are not of
[1:13:23] this fold
[1:13:25] that includes me
[1:13:26] that includes you
[1:13:28] them also i must bring
[1:13:30] and they shall hear my voice and there
[1:13:33] should be one fold one shepherd
[1:13:36] therefore doth my father love me
[1:13:39] because i lay down my life
[1:13:42] that i might take it again
[1:13:45] there it is he emphasizes this he
[1:13:48] repeats it no man
[1:13:50] takes it my life from me
[1:13:53] i lay it down of myself
[1:13:57] i have power to lay it down and i
[1:14:00] have power to take it again
[1:14:04] this commandment have i received
[1:14:07] of my father
[1:14:09] a commandment not only that he can
[1:14:12] but that he must
[1:14:15] there was division therefore again among
[1:14:17] the jews for these saying many of them
[1:14:18] said he has a devil he's mad why do you
[1:14:21] listen to this guy
[1:14:23] this is unprecedented
[1:14:25] it's never happened in the history of
[1:14:26] our planet raise yourself from the dead
[1:14:30] after you're dead
[1:14:32] that's insane must be a delusion from
[1:14:35] satan himself this is what those people
[1:14:36] were thinking
[1:14:39] jesus faith test his ultimate test
[1:14:44] was that without external intervention
[1:14:46] by prophets or holy men or angels
[1:14:49] he would raise himself
[1:14:52] from death
[1:14:54] and another place he said i'll do it on
[1:14:56] the third day
[1:14:59] unlike lazarus there'd be no one
[1:15:01] shouting at the mouth of the tomb jesus
[1:15:03] come forth
[1:15:07] i will lay down my life and i will take
[1:15:10] it up again
[1:15:12] because god my father told me i could
[1:15:16] that i must
[1:15:17] and i have complete trust
[1:15:20] faith
[1:15:21] and what he shows me the faith
[1:15:25] of jesus
[1:15:28] john 5
[1:15:30] jesus answered and said unto them fairly
[1:15:32] verily i say unto you the son can do
[1:15:34] nothing of himself
[1:15:35] but what he sees the father do
[1:15:38] for what things so ever he doeth
[1:15:40] these also
[1:15:42] do with the son likewise
[1:15:45] for the father loves the son shows them
[1:15:47] all things that himself does
[1:15:49] and he will show himself greater works
[1:15:51] than these that you may marvel
[1:15:54] for as the father
[1:15:55] raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them
[1:15:57] gives him life
[1:15:59] even so the son
[1:16:01] quickeneth gives life
[1:16:03] to whom he will
[1:16:06] i can do nothing
[1:16:08] but what the father shows me
[1:16:11] now jesus had to put this to the test
[1:16:15] his faith
[1:16:17] not for lazarus
[1:16:18] not for healing someone else or even
[1:16:20] healing himself
[1:16:22] but for raising himself
[1:16:25] from among the dead
[1:16:27] i lay down my life
[1:16:30] i
[1:16:31] take it up
[1:16:32] again that was jesus faith the unseen
[1:16:36] never happened
[1:16:38] the ultimate hope
[1:16:40] now being put
[1:16:41] to the ultimate test
[1:16:44] well let's see what transpired
[1:16:47] matthew 27 46 this is
[1:16:50] the crucifixion about the ninth hour
[1:16:53] jesus cried with a loud voice saying
[1:16:55] ella alai lama sabachthani
[1:16:59] which is my god
[1:17:01] my god
[1:17:03] why
[1:17:04] have you forsaken me in my greatest need
[1:17:07] in my most desperate hour you've
[1:17:09] abandoned me
[1:17:10] why
[1:17:13] some of them that stood there
[1:17:15] when they heard that said
[1:17:17] this man calls for elias
[1:17:20] straight away one of them ran took a
[1:17:21] sponge filled it with vinegar
[1:17:24] put it on a reed and gave him to drink
[1:17:27] the rest said well let's see if elias
[1:17:30] will come to save him
[1:17:33] here i've combined what luke and john
[1:17:35] tell us
[1:17:36] when jesus therefore had received the
[1:17:39] vinegar he said
[1:17:40] it's finish
[1:17:43] and when jesus had cried with a loud
[1:17:45] voice ah
[1:17:47] he said
[1:17:48] father
[1:17:50] yeah
[1:17:51] the one he just cried out to about
[1:17:52] forsaking him in his agony and torture
[1:17:56] father
[1:17:57] i know you're listening
[1:17:59] father
[1:18:00] into thy hands i command my spirit
[1:18:05] and having said thus he bowed his head
[1:18:08] and gave up the ghost
[1:18:10] yielded
[1:18:11] released his spirit
[1:18:13] laid down his life just as he said he
[1:18:15] would
[1:18:18] time passes
[1:18:20] friday
[1:18:22] friday night
[1:18:25] saturday
[1:18:27] saturday night
[1:18:30] sunday morning arrives
[1:18:33] the third day
[1:18:36] now when jesus was risen early
[1:18:38] on the first day of the week
[1:18:41] he appeared first to mary magdalene out
[1:18:43] of whom he had cast seven devils
[1:18:47] easter
[1:18:49] not hope
[1:18:51] no longer requiring faith it's now
[1:18:54] reality
[1:18:55] it's no longer unseen it's in full view
[1:18:58] it's physical fact
[1:19:01] but so incredible
[1:19:03] that even the faithful who had followed
[1:19:05] him throughout his ministry didn't
[1:19:08] believe it
[1:19:10] not until they saw
[1:19:12] for themselves
[1:19:15] and then it no longer required faith
[1:19:18] john 20 26 after eight days again his
[1:19:21] disciples were within and thomas with
[1:19:23] them
[1:19:24] then came jesus the doors being shut and
[1:19:26] stood in the midst and said
[1:19:30] shalom
[1:19:31] peace be to you
[1:19:35] and he returns to thomas he says
[1:19:38] thomas
[1:19:40] reach hither thy finger behold my hands
[1:19:42] reach into thy hand thrust it into my
[1:19:44] side
[1:19:46] be not faithless
[1:19:48] but believing
[1:19:50] thomas i imagine he fell down at his
[1:19:52] feet there but thomas answered and said
[1:19:54] unto him
[1:19:55] my lord
[1:19:57] and my god
[1:19:59] jesus said to him thomas
[1:20:02] because you've seen me you've believed
[1:20:06] blessed are they that have not seen
[1:20:08] and yet have believed
[1:20:11] faith
[1:20:14] and are they
[1:20:16] we must have faith trust in the reports
[1:20:19] of those who have gone before
[1:20:21] the gospels
[1:20:23] the good news not fake news
[1:20:26] paul's writings
[1:20:28] the bible
[1:20:29] that's why jesus said blessed are those
[1:20:31] who having not seen
[1:20:34] yet believe
[1:20:36] speaking of us here
[1:20:38] tonight
[1:20:40] you'll each of you
[1:20:43] are part of scripture fulfilled
[1:20:46] i hope that tonight
[1:20:48] you've caught a glimpse of jesus as a
[1:20:50] man
[1:20:51] as a human
[1:20:53] a person not a myth
[1:20:55] not some divine being we cannot touch
[1:20:58] a man a very special man to be sure
[1:21:03] but a man nonetheless upon whom our
[1:21:05] faith rests
[1:21:07] should come down
[1:21:09] one of our opening verses
[1:21:11] speaking of the faith of that man
[1:21:13] christ jesus and galatians 2
[1:21:16] knowing that a man is not justified by
[1:21:18] the works of the law
[1:21:20] but by the faith of jesus christ
[1:21:24] even we have believed in jesus christ
[1:21:27] that we might be justified by the faith
[1:21:29] of christ
[1:21:31] not by the works of the law
[1:21:34] for by the works of the law shall no
[1:21:35] flesh be justified
[1:21:37] our hope and faith and trust
[1:21:40] is built on that foundation i like how
[1:21:42] the complete jewish bible puts this
[1:21:44] particular verse
[1:21:47] even so
[1:21:48] we've come to realize that a person is
[1:21:50] not declared righteous by god on the
[1:21:52] ground of his legalistics observance of
[1:21:54] torah commandments
[1:21:56] but through the messiah yeshua is
[1:21:58] trusting faithfulness
[1:22:00] therefore
[1:22:02] we too have put our trust in messiah
[1:22:04] yeshua and become faithful to him in
[1:22:06] order that we might be declared
[1:22:08] righteous on the ground
[1:22:10] of the messiah's trusting faithfulness
[1:22:13] not on the ground of our legalistic
[1:22:15] observance of torah commands
[1:22:18] from the ground of legalism's observance
[1:22:20] of torah commands no one will be
[1:22:22] declared righteous not just jesus faith
[1:22:26] his faithfulness
[1:22:30] as his brother aaron comes to close the
[1:22:32] service i wonder if we could sing

[1:26:59] is
[1:27:02] [Music]
[1:27:09] great is thy faithfulness
[1:27:11] and just as we're seeing the thought
[1:27:14] it says
[1:27:15] when you have
[1:27:17] something you expect
[1:27:20] maybe it says it's like clockwork
[1:27:22] you know it hits a time every time
[1:27:25] or
[1:27:26] somebody that is just consistent
[1:27:29] and maybe your neighbor leaves at six
[1:27:31] o'clock in the morning every morning
[1:27:34] to go to work and you hear the car start
[1:27:35] up and it's kind of you start expecting
[1:27:37] it
[1:27:38] and when it doesn't happen you go what
[1:27:40] happened
[1:27:41] it becomes apart
[1:27:43] but great is his faithfulness
[1:27:46] never once have you said hey lord you
[1:27:47] missed on something
[1:27:49] because he's faithful
[1:27:51] he's the unfailing god
[1:27:54] he's my lord there is no other
[1:27:57] none like him what almighty god we serve
[1:28:01] [Music]
[1:28:03] but that he took on flesh
[1:28:07] he was raised as a child
[1:28:10] this was a
[1:28:11] pretty good
[1:28:12] narrative a pretty good story to wrote
[1:28:15] be able to say he was a child he was a
[1:28:17] baby
[1:28:20] when he needed something he had to ask
[1:28:22] for help
[1:28:24] if he couldn't get up there he got
[1:28:25] picked up
[1:28:27] but he went through those things
[1:28:30] and there's that long period of time
[1:28:32] that we don't know because the bible or
[1:28:34] the history doesn't account for that
[1:28:35] period of time
[1:28:37] but we have a pretty good idea by
[1:28:38] watching our old lives
[1:28:41] yet he overcame it all
[1:28:44] amen let's stand
[1:28:47] i could serve and love a god like that
[1:28:51] that he became me so that i
[1:28:54] through his love could become him
[1:28:57] i i remember

[1:29:04] just have a hard time with that song
[1:29:07] how could he become me

[1:29:14] so he would understand this
[1:29:16] oh he
[1:29:18] became
[1:29:21] so that i might
[1:29:24] become him

[1:29:32] he
[1:29:33] became
[1:29:35] so that i might
[1:29:38] become him
[1:29:46] he
[1:29:47] took my place
[1:29:50] saw that i through his love could take
