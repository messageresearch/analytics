the heart of our brother Daniel for this meeting to be more of a testimonial service for the Youth and he asked me to give my testimony tonight and I know many has heard my testimony many of you haven't but I'm here to obey the scripture that we just read just to give thanks unto the Lord and make known his deeds among the people amen about about late 2021 I I got sick um it was like a normal didn't feel good type sick and it just wore off for a few days but ever since that ever since I um after I recovered ever since I noticed that there was just a few things that were just not normal it was a bit off um some symptoms that were going on um you know I wasn't able to to eat a lot when I'm that type of guy that would get three plates at a buffet you know and you know and then dessert afterwards right but and I just couldn't eat that much anymore and I was losing a lot of weight drastically um my excuse was that oh my stomach shrunk when I got sick I wasn't eating well so it's because of that you know no big deal after another thing that is that I had a cough it just wouldn't go away and the only way to go to make it go away was to um and forgive me for saying this cough out the phlegm throw it all up and I'll be fine and you know it was the cold time I thought it was normal you know it's no big deal it's just the cough you know everyone has flame during the winter time and then the last thing that I remember was um that was that was very itchy especially my legs and just my arms my my chest it it wouldn't be all the time every day but it would just come randomly but it is frequent and that wasn't normal but I I pushed it off you know maybe maybe I forgot to put lotion so I just you know pushed it off and it's everything is fine and that was my that was my um that's how it was up until February of 2022 um one night for some reason I decided to um take a shower at midnight um and usually I'm I don't I don't know why but I decided to go take a shower and put the water all the way hot and I was there for a while I don't take long showers but first it was just I was there for a while there for a while and um while I was the water was pouring down my head I remember getting really getting really drowsy and then before I knew it I I fell and hit my head in the tub um I blacked out and I Heard a Voice far away and it kept getting closer and closer and it was like Isaac Isaac Isaac and I woke up laying in the tub and there was my mom knocking on the door I said open up the door and there I opened up the um I opened up the door to to let my mom in I put on a towel and she asked if I fainted I said I think so I just woke up in the bit the tub and then she saw me and she she said that I looked very pale because I lost a lot of weight you know she she was very worried for me so then she said oh let's go to the hospital and you know and you know moms are right so but thank God for her so then she took me to the emergencies and when they gave me a checkup they were asking questions what happened you know answering what was wrong I fainted in the shower and they asked if the water was hot and I said yeah and they said oh if you were in the if you're there for too long then your blood pressure will drop and you it happens that people will faint all right I didn't know that but okay but you know they told me that everything looks fine except for my heart that um the my heart was beating a little too fast and a little faster than normal and it looked like I was anemic they said and so while we were there my mom was explaining like you know the cough that I had for a while and you know that it won't go away so they scheduled me for an MRI just to just to check if everything was was okay and you know we got to the hospital at one in the morning and we were you know they didn't put me in the MRI until four in the morning so we were there for a while and while we were in the room um to give us the results I was thinking you know it's probably an infection the the lungs you know they'll just give me some medicine and go home you know I'll call off work since it's too late you know I'll I'll skip work that was my mentality comes the doctor in the room and about 10 other nurses surrounding me in my bed and they gave giving us the news that there was a large mass between my heart and lung little bits of masses around my chest and there was some liquid under my heart and the words then the words of the doctor is the most unforgettable Unforgettable words that it will still stick to me to this day and then the doctor said it might be cancerous in a human reaction right I my heart dropped I I it was the last thing I wanted to hear when I didn't even want to go to the hospital and that's what that's the news that they gave me and the net and I was just but in my heart dropped I as a human reaction right but in the next moment I came to my senses and I thought no no I don't have it I don't accept it I knew it was the devil was there making me try to sign that box of snakes brother Brown says that if you sign that box of snakes you accepted your sickness but even but the deal was telling me that my name was on that box but I I did not sign it I don't it could go right back to hell where it came from it ain't mine even though my it's your name's on there it ain't mine by his stripes I am healed Glory your brother bam says if you confess your healing that makes your body be healed if that's what he says for I rather listen to what the what the word says than what my symptoms says Jonah says symptoms are just vanity [Applause] so it doesn't matter I did I didn't I I blocked out the doctor I I couldn't believe it no I didn't want to believe it it was just the LIE of the devil I felt fine so I don't know what she was talking about I never claimed to have it I always said the doctor diagnosed me with this but I never said I had it I feel like that's accepting defeat of what my Jesus did on Calvary that that day [Music] so right over for the doctors it was really it really is a very risky you know situation for my life and they put me in the ICU right away you know they wanted to treat me right away it was very it was it was very riskful it was too close to my heart um and they couldn't take it out because it was right there next to my heart um so they put me in the ICU so they can test me to to see um well the what cancer I had that they claimed that I had I um and I was in the hospital for three weeks and in those three weeks many many brothers around around the world really around the world just um sending me messages and and their prayers and words of comfort and it was and I'll be honest it was overwhelming for me to see so much love and all I did was cry all I did was cry in the hospital is sleep and cry that's all I did but you know being in that situation that's where I kind of examined myself examined my life why was this happening to me you know was it a mistake that I committed was it a sin I made was it a uh just a trial was it um to see what I would do was it a trial for my family to see what they would do so see maybe something that they have done it was just many thoughts coming to me was it for my church because what happened to me really um it hit hard for my church only to realize you know later that it was a multi-purpose that's how God works amen they later finally diagnosed me with um Hodgkin's lymphoma that was the name and they told me that I was going to do five rounds of chemotherapy and um it was rough it was it was a rough um time to go through I was just at home just feeling bad something new to my body it's a poison to kill all the bad but it also kills all the good but I still was going through it you know I pushed through you know my my hair fell out you know I had no eyebrows I couldn't grow facial hair I you know after and after just a while of being at home I finally went back to church again little by little and they would start you know put me to play an instrument little by little taking it easy they finally put me in a song Lead little by little and even to interpret a minister at my church's bilingual so we do English and Spanish and I would still do chemotherapy but I will still go to church and it didn't matter how I felt because I needed to go to church amen and it didn't matter how I felt I still went in church because if that's the case since when did we go off by feelings since when did we go off by feelings no no you know that no no I was giving my sacrifice of praise to God and and I claim my victory I claim my victory while I was going to church I was letting the devil know which side I was on Brothers If You're Going Through Hell at this moment and you're here you're letting the devil whose side you're on you got to let the devil know who signed you're on Amen it doesn't matter what you're going through Brothers you're here and that's what matters and I believe God has something for you this evening there was times where I would do chemotherapy that Wednesday morning and I will still go to church that Wednesday night even to put me the song lead to do something and I will still do it even after doing chemotherapy I wasn't forced to do it no one forced me to do it I wanted to do it on my own because I knew that was my sacrifice of praise [Music] one time brother Daniel came to minister at Wednesday Wednesday evening and they they it was my turn to interpret the minister so I did chemotherapy that Wednesday but the Lord was with me and after I left the clinic I was I was feeling like a million bucks and I went and interpreted brother Daniel and it it once you see it you won't know that I I did chemotherapy that day the Lord Will Smith me bro brother Daniel said it was just two two bald Brothers up there and well and well I did chemotherapy for for three months and um and I still give thanks God for that because there was kids in that clinic that have been doing chemotherapy for for three years and it was still going and doing it so I had no right to complain I had no right to even be offended to what God put me through it I believe that it's a purpose that God put me through it amen I still gave him my praise brothers and sisters I did it for three months and I know that I had no right to complain to God you best believe I gave my praise to God I gave him praise that no matter what and you might say brother well that's well that's just weird that's just weird why would you give praise to God while you're going through that that's a little crazy in it but Brothers I I I'm considered what the prophet calls an oddball brothers and sisters even though I'm not feeling that Brothers I'm still gonna praise him no matter what brother and sister brother but that that's just that's just crazy that's just weird no one you know but we're supposed to be oddballs amen that's what really Brown said that sometimes we're we're supposed to be oddballs to the world but many times we're oddballs to the the same people we sit in church with brothers and sisters oh like you know what why why why why why why is he jumping why is he shouting why is he so happy why is he so happy because I got something to be happy about brothers and sisters really Brothers I got something to be happy about brother and sisters and if you want to be happy brothers and sisters just think about what you've gone through where you were and think about where you are now first if you think about where you are now they'll give you some Praise In Your Heart brothers and sisters and have no right to complain to the Lord Jesus oh Brothers we're all about through the world brother sisters we have no and you might say that this is crazy why do you have to act like that way you know you can't act like that way in Church Brothers read Acts chapter two brothers and sisters and that settles it that settles it brothers and sisters my my I love the Lord all my heart do you amen I just oh man there was I just I was in a you know my Jesus had to roll up his sleeves to get me out of the muck that I was in and if he could save me billion sisters I believe that he can save each and every one of you here I don't know what's your situation this evening Lord this this evening brothers and sisters but I believe the Lord is here amen I believe with this atmosphere we welcome the Lord Jesus this morning this evening and and by the grace of God I am here I'm I should be dead brother and sisters but I am here Brothers there was we finally [Applause] they finally checked me again um after three months that's scheduled and they saw that my mass has shrunk there was no active cells there was nothing and that I was declared cancer free [Applause] Ze amen amen I'm mine that alone brothers and sisters I don't deserve it I don't deserve it brothers and sisters but despite the grace of God I am here I don't know what's the purpose that I'm here but I believe he has me here just to give my testimony to you all how many know that he's the same yesterday and today well just like that the devil is also the same from yesterday and today they they appointed me as a recommendation to take radiation is just in case they you know it comes back just in case it's still there so you know I already claimed my victory before the doctors told me I was cancer free I didn't even accept the brothers and sisters but they appointed to me just to check out the clinic I am all right I'll go to the clinic and going there there's this you know the doctor was you know just you know very he was like a Salesman trying to you know get me to sign my name to get some radiation and that's that's basically it brother then it that's how it was analysis and then he and then worst of all he said oh just you know we want to um kill the cancer right and then I was like cancer they said I was cancer free no no it's still there it's still there we just want to you know make sure to kill it you know oh well that's not what my doctor said they said that it's cancer free I'm cancer free no no no I don't know what you know what she's talking about but you still have it so you need radiation and that's thinking devil that stinking devil and I and I just I just I I I can smell that like nah you know what no I don't let me think about it I said but I walked out uh just convinced that you know what no I don't need it all right that's that's claiming defeat that's claiming defeat and I said you know what thank you Lord for for healing me and that that that settles it amen I was I and I I felt relieved I felt you know and and like ever before I gave praise to the Lord that he deserves like never before and and that's you know many times that's where I end off my the testimony that I would you know give to amongst other churches but but late but throughout the year this all happened last year and throughout the year the Lord has been um working in me and and I found you know I found out why I had to go through all this I knew that I wasn't um and I knew that I I had to be in in somewhere else I knew I wasn't um spiritually right if I can say it that way and he was just working up to me giving he the Lord put conviction in my heart to right my wrongs to finally stop to you know I believe that what I went through as a wake-up call to say stop playing Church and that's what we got to do brother we got to stop playing Church and um just you know just conviction after conviction and there and while going through that that's where the devil took advantage and you know putting all the guilt that I've done in my past and laid out on me and say see you're not worth it you're not worthy you know I was raised in a in a message Pew to say I was born and raised in the message but that you know so I knew what was the truth and from then on I knew that you know I knew what was right and what was wrong and growing up you know that you know I did some you know might not be big deal things but you know according to the Bible is still wrong to do and I believe we all go gone through that through those those stages I don't know what you youth are going through right now bios no coincidence that you're here and that's where the devil took advantage and said you know you know you're you're worthless no you do you know you you're you did all this and and look at you now and I said man I don't deserve anything I didn't deserve the healing I don't deserve anything from God and and and it would really bring me down but there was moments where I would you know even you mean open up the table app just the quotes there it was speaking to me in the situation I was going through even going to to YouTube to random preachings I was just pressing a random preaching years ago and it felt like it was speaking to me and I feel like God had a multi-purpose for me and because of what I go through and what I went through it it led me to to the beginning of this year I was just so I I knew I knew were the stage that I was at and I knew that I didn't deserve anything I knew I knew I was I was I just don't deserve anything and there was a there was just a a moment in time where I I I just um I got sick and tired of being sick and tired so one Sunday morning I went to the altar just you know before service start and I just laid it all to God and I feel like I confessed everything that I'd done because some you know sometimes you know your parents know what your child has done but you don't really confront them into and you want them to confront you about it I feel like God knew what I was doing knew what I had done but he wanted me to confront him about it and from there on it was just it was just peace it was just and that's where it led me to and I knew I knew there were some stages left in my life that I had to complete and then one one Sunday morning I heard of a Brother's testimony that said you know about receiving the Holy Ghost and that was those the stage that you know I was at I needed to I knew I needed to receive the Holy Ghost and this brother said that you don't ask God for the Holy Ghost and I was like what and he said just thank them for the Holy Ghost because it's a promise he promised it to you brilliant sisters and I just and I knew that that it was speaking to me because how his testimony his life of receiving the Holy Ghost I was going through that so I just I just knew and even the devil tried to put doubt but I said no you know what that that's you God and thank you for that and that Sunday morning I just started thanking him thanking God for the Holy Ghost and just thanking him and thanking him and then it was earlier this year brother and sisters that I've received my baptism of the Holy Ghost and brothers if he did it to me he can do it to you tonight he's the same yesterday today and forever the same God that poured out the holy ghost in the day of Pentecost can do it tonight brothers and sisters I believe that we're expecting tonight and I believe that that's that trial that God put me through of getting of you know saying that they got cancer and going through all those stages I believe it all led to the to the beginning of the year and I just just give thanks to God for that and that's that's my testimony right there that's where it ends and I'm praising God no matter what I'm still you know just because you got the Holy Ghost doesn't mean it's all victories and flowers and roses brothers and sisters brothers it's been the most and just to put it in words the most miserable but yet the most Victorious and it doesn't matter I can't I can't go back brothers and sisters I can't go back I just gotta keep going forward Brothers thank so that's my testimony That's What the Lord Has Done in my life and I hope that it's a great you know it's a good use of you all youth I don't know what you're going through I don't know if you have a sickness but I believe but as a witness I'm a witness of Divine Healing then they might say that the days of Miracles have passed but they could just talk to me and

Jonathan Salcido to come and speak to us amen [Music] surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days all the days of my life surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days all the days

[Music] amen is good to be with you all I bless you I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ hey man what a wonderful atmosphere it is I tell I was telling the brother back there I was like you know if I had a nickname people would call me teary-eyed because I I just you know when I feel the presence of the Lord I just became teary-eyed you know but I just want to greet you in the name of Lord Jesus Christ I come from Glendale my pastor's name is brother Daniel fraho he greets everybody here in the name of Lord Jesus Christ I'd like to start with the scripture we could all stand up for this and if you turn me to John 10 10 if I could uh just put a a headline to my testimony it would be called Mercy said no John chapter 10 and verse 10 it says the thief cometh not but for it to still and to kill and to destroy and I come that they may have life and that it may have it more abundantly amen now Luke and verse in chapter 1 verse 78 and 79 it says Through The Tender Mercies of God whereby the day Springs from the high has visited us to give us to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet in the way of peace and uh Genesis chapter 1 and verse 2 and 4 it says the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw that the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness you see we know that where when there is Darkness amen but when light comes that Darkness needs to go away you know the devil you may have your seats amen the devil what he wants to do is to stop our growth he doesn't want us growing in our faith especially when you're you're young especially when you're just starting to know who you are amen because I believe it's important to know who we are as Christians and uh you know it's like in the CH when the children of Israel when Pharaoh there's a new Pharaoh that came to the land he's seen a great Army he see a people that were very Mighty but he got his guys and he said let us deal more wisely with them amen and what he did he said he said task Masters over them to afflict them with burdens amen he gave a Commandment that they killed all the firstborn men child we see the devil is like a type of that pharaoh he sees and he knows when you're growing amen that Pharaoh saw when when Israel started to grow amen and he got scared because he saw potential of a great Army amen but let me tell you the Bible says but the more that they were Afflicted the more that they grew amen and the more that we are afflicted the more that we grow amen so when I was a little child I was raised in church and uh when the church just like many of you do you know every Sunday Wednesdays Thursdays meetings and stuff like that but you know going to school and you get a wrong wrong crowd and so I I was drifting away drifting away drifting away and then one day I started uh going through a bunch of panic attacks and depression it's about 14 15 years old and uh I remember after I was going through those panic attacks in the depression I just couldn't do it no more my mom would take me to the hospital no one could tell me what was happening with me and uh the doctor said I was normal I just couldn't do it no more so I try ending my life it didn't work not tried again and it didn't work I finally got fed up with the and I remember just going in a room I found my knees on the floor and I just started crying to the Lord mind you I was a kid that wanted to play at church when service was going on and the Deacon said get back in church but you know um when I cried to the Lord I said I can't do this no more take my life let me just wake up and not be here anymore but let me tell you brother I say this because God allowed me to go through this help me to always remember him throughout my whole entire life and when I said I couldn't do no more I'm not kidding you brother when I say this I felt something coming to the room and just put his arms around around me and he says I love you he says you're not alone I'm here for you he said go to church amen he says go to any church go to church and I'll be with you I was a little boy amen and I did I went to church I put my dad's suit that didn't fit me it was like this I got my mom's Bible I just walked to the first church on around the corner and uh someone had asked me really where are you going and I'm going to church and but when I was going to church that whole time I felt God that he was right next to me walking with me but as a teenager I gone bully when I was in the church I got bullied you know well let me just say that things had happened and you know I have friends and some family that were bullying me about little things and I let stuff get to me so um if you don't mind I'm gonna share my testimony how it is amen and so uh 18 years old comes and I I just uh I just started smoking started smoking marijuana then uh 21 years old comes I started uh doing heroin for about three months and uh after that you know I I I just felt really low in my life but I'd always remember when God came into that room and uh for the longest time I was struggling like that I was in a five-year relationship and I ended up moving to Utah I'm telling you Brothers it got to a point when I was in a car and if I had been going to some party or something like that and switching the radio station out here a worship song Come On and I'll just started weeping crying crying you know then turn the channel because I need to get into another Spirit that's how I was I didn't want to get soft that's how the devil had me just being real with you amen and so when I was in Utah I remember uh I had not went to church in a very long time and I remember uh the girls with at the time her parents or her mom their Apostolic and so one day they invited us to go to church and so I went to a service with them as soon as they started singing I just started weeping crying always just something inside me and we know you know God's put a seed in there before the foundation of the world God knows amen and I would just cry and cry and I remember I grabbed the the microphone in that church and I was like ah you know I don't know why I'm crying but I'm just I said the God is touching my heart and it started there but after that I ended up doing the same old thing where God slow in that town so I had to move and I was working in Utah it was St George Utah and when I was down there um I ended up getting let go from the job that I was supposed to have and eventually I was going to be homeless I had my car my dad he uh wanted me to come back but I knew they went to church and I didn't know if I wanted to be around that you know and so uh struggling I remember I was proud I was very proud and I was like you know I'm gonna make it on my own I'm gonna do this because you know that's just how I was and I remember I had not prayed in a very long time and this night I'd asked I'd asked God I was on Craigslist looking for I could run out of room to stay or something and uh I didn't get responses I only had like forty dollars in my name and I remember that night though I remember asking the Lord I said you know what I don't want to be homeless I was like give me a place to stay I mean no I can't say it was a deep prayer but I remember just asking him like if I was just asking someone like one of my brothers here for something just just talking to him like he was just a friend and I had and I went to work and when I got off I was going to eat a hot meal because I didn't want to be starving and homeless all this going on the same night and I remember when I got to my car by the time I touched my car I get a phone call and someone calls me and says I seen your uh message and uh I have an apartment over here you don't need money right now you can come over here I'll give you the keys and God got my attention right there as a sinner I started I was drinking I was doing all this well while that happened to me amen well that happened to me and I and I thought about that I was like look at the way my life is yeah why did you do that for me why amen and so uh why I had this apartment now I was struggling because I was drinking I was I was uh having to wash clothes at the laundromat and that was ten dollars every time so I mean my money was just I would ask my dad for some money but um this time I didn't really have money I was eating ramen noodles for like two weeks Hot Pockets coca-colas I'm being serious in one night I don't have a bed I'm laying on the ground no bed just a blanket a pillow no bed and I remember looking around this apartment I'm like you know what again I talked with the Lord I said you gave me this apartment because I'm hungry give me some food [Music] you gave me this apartment give me some food it was like the next day I went to uh to work and after I worked that day they asked me to help the other guy at the furniture side of the business we went and after that job we uh dropped off the furniture then the the guy tips the other guy 10 bucks but the kid right when before we left he turns to me he goes you can have this ten dollars and so I was proud I didn't want to cry just then and I went to my job I clocked out or I was in my car I was crying I started weeping and I was like you know what Lord I was like I know that this is just ten dollars but you made me feel like a millionaire amen and uh times even after that like twice I would go to restaurants and they'd just give me free food the Lord providing for me like that so then I ended up going on YouTube and it's still on there I can share it with you all if you'd like but I went on YouTube I had piercings in my ear I mean I was like I was a mess but I went on YouTube I was like if you don't know Jesus godla loves you he he fed me over here and just testified and yet you know in that condition but I made a decision to go back to Arizona to go to go to church but I ended up going to church and I was going to a denomination and uh it didn't last because you know the enemy he brought he brought see the enemy knows what you like and at the time he knew what what I liked meant something had to change the things I like how to change but at that time he knew what he what he can get me with and uh he brought a girl around and I ended up um not going to church I ended up uh I ended up selling drugs just being real with you all selling drugs I ended up drinking I ended up doing all that stuff going from store to store doing bad things and uh you know my brother one day I was dropping people off to rehab and my brother he ended up I get a call and they're saying you need to come to the hospital and I was like okay well it's maybe not that serious and drinking all the weight on the way there um they tell us to go back in the back of the hospital and they say you know we're sorry to say we your brother was in an accident in a motorcycle accident and they said we did everything that we could but your brother he's he's gone I remember when they said that just I was like it was Unreal I was like what you're saying my brother's gone and you know right then and there I wasn't I wasn't mad with God like that but I did have I was talking to him I said you know what he had a family he had kids and I was like and I don't look at my life as I should have took me why would you take him and uh but I know now you know but um I'd ask that you know why would you take him but I know that I knew he had a plan though I was like I know you had to have something about this amen his funeral comes and I was just kind of just out of it and when his funeral came Brothers came Brothers preached and everything but I didn't that didn't turn my life to the Lord it didn't and my brother my other brother it did you know but what happened it was like the enemy just knew how to uh what to bring around me and I had a friend that he used and and he said you know you I your brother just died I got you we'll go here we can drink here you don't need money I got you and that's what the enemy tries to do he wants to offer you everything in this world he wants to offer you the money and if you're watching things that you're not supposed to be watching he wants you to he wants you to see how other people live look how much money they had look how much cars they have you know look at all the things they have don't you want that but two months two months after my brother had a passed away I try to calm down my life from my mom and my family and uh what happened was is one night I got invited to to drink and I went over there and uh the guy his uh the mother of his child was out in a place at another party and we went over there and the guys pulled out guns and so I thought they were gonna get shot and see this is the thing I didn't want to be known to run on my friends and I could have ran trust me but I stood my grounds like I'm not gonna run even though they ran they ended up running and when they came close to me they said you guys ain't never coming back over here and as soon as the car started all three of those guys started shooting and I got shot four times twice in my leg once in my abdomen once in my shoulder and I was bleeding out in that moment when I was shot I thought about one thing and it's how I didn't serve God how I didn't how I didn't live the way I was supposed to live amen what I could have done better I cried to the Lord I said give me another chance Lord help me Lord I don't want to die like this I can't go my my brother just just died I can't die give me another chance give me a different testimony I went to that hospital and four hours later I left with no surgeries they ended up the blood just ended up stopping it wasn't pouring out like it was no more they didn't have to give me no blood transfusions amen but even then I didn't quite learn too well let me tell you one night when I was drinking and all that stuff I remember my dad it was like a Sunday Sunday my dad knocked on my door he said it's time for church and I woke up and I was like oh I don't really want to go but I remember it's like the largest do you remember what you told me look at your dad he just lost his son and uh I went I was like okay I'm gonna go so I went you know in the beginning I went and you know the Bible says that in Luke 15 1 it says then he drew near unto them the publicans the Sinners to hear him in the Pharisees and the scribes murder saying this man receive his Sinners and eateth with them and he spanked a parable into him saying well man of you having a hundred sheep if he loses one of them does he not leave the 99 in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he find it amen and my dad he invited me to church and I went it was a good service amen I went home and I fell asleep and there they left to go to the service that night and what happened was my mom and her heart said he should have been here he should have been with us but around that time that she was feeling that way I had a dream and a dream and a voice told me get up and go back to church and I woke up and I'm thinking it's just a dream but I hear it again get up and go back to church so I go back to church let me tell you a good shepherd when he when he sees his sheep that's just right there wandering around he calls his sheep but his sheep know his voice amen and knows his voice and in that service they're preaching I started hearing a call man I started hearing the shout amen and let me tell you that shout was different than any denomination she could ever preach amen because when I went in the nomination nothing stuck to me that's why I kept leaving but let me tell you when I heard that scream something happened with inside of me amen and I remember after the preaching it was like how that young man how he had a two sons and he gave he gave the one son his portion went and spent it on riotous living and then he started to be in want amen he came back it didn't matter if he was just a servant in his father's house amen maybe someone here has straight away and he used to be a song leader maybe you used to have a position but tell that young man just wanted to be in his father's house amen when his father seen him he had compassion on him and I remember when they were preaching amen and after they started stopped preaching the song leader was singing I raised up my hands amen I raised up my hands amen I started praising the Lord but let me tell you how that father had compassion on his son I turned and looked at my dad and he was crying and he had compassion on me they didn't do an altar call but I went right up to that altar saying Lord help me help me Lord I need you and I can't do this without you I need you to help me I can't do it amen so when that's when that sheet was lost and the Good Shepherd when he was screaming out and he finally found it he found he laid it on his shoulders and he started rejoicing amen brother says did you ever notice Jesus when he cast out the devil he'd done it with his finger Jesus said if if I cast out the devil the Finger of God with the Finger of God see what the devil is to him for healing is just a little thing but watch when the Sheep is lost what did he do he went and he got his sheep and put it on his shoulders amen Robert Brown says what's the strongest part of a man it's his back and it's his legs see the devil is nothing to him but the Sheep he puts it across his shoulders holds his feet he packs it with the strongest of his body and he gets it back to the fold see God loves his children he loves you he loves me amen [Applause] I'll be closing right now you know I personally I you know um okay well after after that you know after you start coming to church after you you've answered an altar call you know or if you didn't and you just went up to the altar after that like brother was saying you think it's going to be easy oh I remember I was at work and I had a like seven panic attacks horrible yes bro seven seven panic attacks and I wanted to give up and I was gonna end my life once again and I remember I went to that house my my house and I was going to go to the room but my mom I said I need help you guys got to give me help my mom could have said oh there's a hospital there but she said no they're having meetings over there hey man she didn't put to no hospital she pointed to a place where Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen what a sinner can come into church and be filled with the Holy Ghost and the presence of God come down touch a young boy such a young girl and they will never be the same no more that's a place where I'm talking about amen and what happened was I was like Mom the services are at are at five and it's already seven but she's all but you can go get prayed for I said you're right and I went and my brother was coming but he wanted to do something and I was like I'm not waiting for you and I took off on him he followed me in his car but when we got there the deacons of the church I'd asked them I was like where the preachers at I need prayer he said the Pastor he changed the time from five to seven he made it in time for the song service God's good my brothers I know it's special if he did it then he could do it now he's still doing it I walked inside that church and while me and my brother because he made it the same time well me and my brother we ran through the door saying hallelujah glory to God hallelujah and we get back there we had to sit in the very back and I always I liked sitting in the front so and they it was like on the back like say like where the door is at over there and um I was like Lord I wanted to be in the front I was like I wanted to be in the front right when I was going to sit down in my chair my blood comes from me and he goes hey there's two seats for you and your brother right in the front the whole church was packed but those two seats and that brother that was preaching he preached about your your mind and suicide and man God reached out and gave me some strength but let me tell you I had panic attacks for like almost a year I had infected ingrown toenail like three times after one just went away another one appeared another one appeared after I was good from that I mean right after each other I I was playing volleyball I sprained my ankle right after my ankle was healed and I claimed I'm like yeah my ankle's good I was at work in uh in a wood chipper machine fell on my foot yeah and I went through four surgeries and I remember before the day I was gonna have the surgery I asked God to heal him I said if you don't I'll love you but I remember when it did fall in my foot I was crying and there's men watching me but this time I wasn't proud no more hey man I started crying and I said look I'm not crying because this hurts I'm crying because God already knows what I'm going through and it's and I'm already going through Allah it hurts I'm going through a lot but let me tell you I was going through a lot and uh when I went to that hospital and I was going to have the operation sister called me and she said it's these times we praise God in the good times and we praise God in the bad times and I said you're right and I was like Lord if you heal my foot in Jesus name but if you don't I will raise my hands to you and say I love you Lord I woke up and my my toe was gone but in my heart I wanted I wanted someone to come to my room with a guitar and people to sing it was like either that same day or the following day a pastor from a church came to my door was sung with a guitar and people to sing and one of the first songs they sang was you are worthy of it all [Applause] I felt the presence of God come inside this room son I am worthy of it all you're not alone amen the Bible says that Jesus says come to me all those that are heavy laden and I will give you rest amen amen take my yoke upon you and learn of me for my yoke is easy my burden is light see a yoke goes over two animals when they go plowing to pull a load but sometimes you know they they match a big one with the little one amen the reason why they do that because they're trying to train the little one but see not only does a big one carry the load he carries a little one too and I tell you what there's one carrying the load right now his name is Jesus Christ amen he's carrying the load off of you amen no matter what you've been through God will carry that load [Applause] his burden is lights he'll take not only the load off of you he carries you also but the enemy is going to make you just think negative look what you did look what you did look what you did he tries to keep you in that Realm but let me tell you I read one time of the footprints of the sand and that touched my heart that man that dreamed a dream or he had a vision I forgot but but he looked back in that the most horriblest time of his life before him and the Lord were walking together he saw two Footprints but he said that at the most horrible time of his life he said he only saw one set of footprints amen and he told the Lord he said you'd be with me where were you and he said that's right you did see one set of footprints but it was in that time I was carrying you and God wants to carry you this night he's ready to carry you amen he's ready to do something for you we got to get desperate it's not too late it's not too late amen devil could have told Samson it was too late for him since went into that prison blind with and his hair cut off but remember while he was in prison the Bible said he started to pray he started to have a prayer meeting and realized everything that he was doing was wrong but let me tell you but when he got into on his knees because there's power in prayer that hair that was on Samson started to grow back amen and God and when when they're going to make a show out of Samson he came out and he said to this lad permit that I touched this and he said Lord just once more use me just once more and it wasn't too late for Samson amen I'm closing with this brother Daniel Curry amen he was an evangelist amen he was caught up in a Transit I believe brother Brandon said and what happened he went over there to heaven and he said I'm Daniel Curry the Evangelist my life Journey has ended and I come in here but they said we don't have your name right here he said you can appeal your case to the white Throne judgment he said what more could I do than to appeal my case and he went into the white Throne judgment but he was right there he said things were getting brighter things were getting brighter amen but he asked him we the Lord asked him did you live perfect nope were you honest nope and everything that he was saying he was guilty amen but there was someone that stood in his place and he turned he said I heard the sweetest voice he ever seen [Applause] amen thou sweeter than any mother's voice and he's seen the sweetest face that he ever saw amen but Jesus came and he said father you're right Daniel Curtin man made those things but while he was on Earth he stood for me amen so he says I'll stand for him amen I'll tell you if you're struggling with something amen where there's depression whether it's panic attacks whether it's the devil just beating you on your mistakes amen surrender to him amen get on your knees and start praying to the Lord start surrendering with him and with with everything that you have amen amen he is here to provide you for your needs whether if it's healing for your bodies he's a Healer still with his forgiveness he's still forgiving and my God can do everything ever since I gave my life to the Lord amen there ain't no Rock going to take my place as long as I'm alive I'll glorify I will praise His name amen praising me man as brother comes up amen Praise Him in the good times Praise Him in The Bad Times praise him through the trials praise him through all the sufferings praise him through all those things amen because he is here he said you are his the Bible said he ain't gonna lose one amen that's his promise to you that's his promise to me he's the same yesterday today and forever he's my friend he's my best friend he's my father he is my mother he is my all and my all amen thank you surrender amen run to him get on your knees pray to the Lord give them your all amen God is here to meet you I promise if you just trust in him see what the Lord can do don't lean on to your
