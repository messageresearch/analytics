[13:14] just thanking him for being the
[13:17] Overcomer in US amen

[13:23] remember dad
[13:25] um it's been uh quite a struggle
[13:29] and I I know he's listening and he he
[13:31] knows but the doctors told my brother 6
[13:35] months the longest but maybe two two or
[13:38] three months he's
[13:41] rapidly he just he has no energy no
[13:43] strength no not hungry and and so forth
[13:47] and a lot of pain but he told me
[13:49] yesterday he said I just want to go and
[13:52] I said it's okay you can go amen we'll
[13:54] take care of Mom everything will be all
[13:56] right amen but we'll have another one up
[14:00] there cross one his day to shake your
[14:03] hand say I made it but spent the night
[14:07] with him on

[14:12] well and every 15 20 minutes calling out
[14:15] you know and I said you know I think we
[14:18] do that to our Heavenly Father quite
[14:20] often father but he'd not just sleep he'
[14:22] never Slumbers so I was I was just
[14:26] asking the Lord I said you know our days
[14:29] are numbered maybe it's it's his time
[14:32] just remind him and I would say to all
[14:35] of us of your goodness Lord of your
[14:37] grace of your blessings what you've done
[14:40] rather than the focus of what you're
[14:42] going through by saying Lord you've been
[14:43] good to me you've been my strength
[14:46] you've been my help and I have something
[14:48] to thank you for so it's it's a it's a
[14:51] hard time but time goes on we all go
[14:54] through it but there's something inside
[14:57] of us that knows that on the other side
[14:59] it will be worth it all amen so brother
[15:02] Daniel if you take
[15:06] the go

[15:13] these our
[15:15] brother G's
[15:18] gone he's an old
[15:21] man and there'll be a day if the Lord
[15:23] carries that he will cross over to the
[15:26] other side and his brother Aaron was
[15:28] just talking
[15:30] this scripture came to
[15:32] mind it's 1 Thessalonians chap 4:1 16
[15:36] for the Lord
[15:37] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[15:40] shout with the voice of an
[15:42] archangel and with the Trump of God and
[15:46] the dead in Christ shall rise first then
[15:48] we which are alive and remain shall be
[15:51] caught up together with them in the
[15:53] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[15:57] so shall we ever be with with the Lord
[16:00] and then the next verse says wherefore
[16:02] Comfort one another with these words
[16:05] those are comforting
[16:07] words we have a great promise to look
[16:11] forward
[16:12] to brother Michael's good to see you my

[17:08] have already been up
[17:09] there um and then this
[17:12] Sunday a Sunday night I want to have a
[17:14] special
[17:15] service with some of our elders in our
[17:19] church and I want to pass the microphone
[17:22] around like I do sometimes I want to
[17:26] give it to them and say tell us
[17:29] something that stands out in your life
[17:32] that was either a
[17:34] success and you would want to pass that
[17:37] wisdom on to someone else or a failure
[17:40] that you could say don't do this this is
[17:43] where I failed in my life don't do that
[17:47] I think we have tremendous wisdom in our
[17:51] church and it's in our elders not only
[17:56] should our elders be respected and I
[17:58] believe that we do respect respect them
[17:59] but they should also be listened to they
[18:02] should be
[18:03] revered with this great wisdom that they
[18:07] have I was telling somebody
[18:09] today that to get 20 years of
[18:13] experience brother Dan it takes 20
[18:16] years you don't just come into this
[18:19] world with all the wisdom that you do
[18:23] have when you leave this world so I I
[18:25] want to take advantage of our elders
[18:28] that we have and I want to hear what
[18:29] they have to say so especially I want
[18:32] everybody to come on Sunday night and

[25:20] anticipation amen of that
[25:25] day see if I can remember how to do do
[25:31] this
[25:41] okay Ah that's what I was looking
[25:45] for the Book of
[25:48] Proverbs it may come as no surprise to
[25:51] you but this is May
[25:55] 15th on May 14th
[25:59] 1948 exactly 76 years ago the Modern
[26:03] Nation of Israel came into being as a
[26:05] British mandate expired and the rule of
[26:08] Israel was turned over to the
[26:09] provisional government headed by David
[26:13] benion that's a picture of them
[26:16] announcing their Declaration of
[26:18] Independence only 11
[26:20] minutes after that Declaration of
[26:22] Independence that evening in Tel Aviv
[26:25] President Harry EST Truman formally
[26:27] recognized the new state of
[26:30] Israel a Palestinian state was also
[26:33] declared by the United Nations effec of
[26:35] that same date but the Palestinian
[26:37] people and the surrounding Arab
[26:39] governments rejected that statehood
[26:41] Civil War had been raging in mandatory
[26:44] Palestine since November 29th of
[26:47] 1947 following the UN vote to partition
[26:50] Palestine into two states on the morning
[26:54] of May 15th 1948 76 years years ago
[26:58] today a pan Arab Army
[27:01] invaded comprised of the armies of
[27:03] Lebanon Syria Iraq trans Jordan and
[27:06] Egypt with contingents from Saudi Arabia
[27:08] and Yemen their stated purpose to drive
[27:11] the Jews into the
[27:13] sea the War lasted 10 months officially
[27:17] ending not with a treaty but with a
[27:19] series of armistice agreements signed
[27:21] from February 24th through July 20 of
[27:24] 1949 the area now called the West Bank
[27:28] was annexed by trans Jordan which then
[27:31] changed its name to Jordan the territory
[27:34] now called the Gaza Strip was occupied
[27:36] by Egypt there was no thought of an
[27:38] independent Palestinian state it was a
[27:40] grab for
[27:42] territory there was no push for a
[27:44] two-state solution there was only a cry
[27:46] for the destruction of Israel and the
[27:49] establishment of Arab of mlim rule over
[27:52] the entire area the invading armies
[27:55] encouraged the Arab residents of the
[27:57] territory that was to be Israel to
[28:00] flee they could return and enjoy The
[28:02] Spoils of Victory once the Jewish people
[28:05] were destroyed pushed into the
[28:08] sea thus the youngest Palestinian
[28:12] refugee today would be 76 years old any
[28:16] younger ones up to age 57 were born in
[28:19] territories controlled by Jordan and
[28:21] Egypt until 1967 for nearly 20 years
[28:25] this proposed two-state solution was
[28:27] thwarted by Israel's Arab neighbors it
[28:30] wasn't until Jordan lost the West Bank
[28:33] and Egypt lost the Sinai including the
[28:36] Gaza Strip in The Six Day War of June
[28:39] 1967 that the Arab Nations started
[28:41] calling for a Palestinian State as part
[28:44] of a two-state solution to the refugee
[28:47] problem that they had helped
[28:49] create after the 1967 war Israel
[28:53] inherited the so-called refugee camps
[28:55] the Arab Nations declared war and
[28:57] encouraged people to become refugees
[28:59] have never taken responsibility for
[29:01] their actions and seem to have the World
[29:03] At Large convinced it's all Israel's
[29:05] problem and certainly Israel's
[29:09] fault now more than ever we need to pray

[30:59] well in a complete departure from my
[31:02] Norm let's read our opening scriptures
[31:04] from Proverbs Chapter
[31:07] 1 the opening verses are an introduction
[31:10] and describe the reason for the
[31:12] collection of these sayings or Proverbs
[31:15] Proverbs 1:1 the Proverbs of Solomon the
[31:19] son of David king of
[31:21] Israel their purpose is to know to gain
[31:25] wisdom and instruction to perceive the
[31:28] words of understanding insight to
[31:32] receive the instruction of wisdom
[31:35] Justice judgment Equity that means
[31:39] Integrity to give subtlety Prudence
[31:43] caution to the simple to the young man
[31:46] knowledge and
[31:49] discretion a w a wise man will hear and
[31:52] will increase learning and a man of
[31:56] understanding shall attain unto wise
[31:59] counsels that means acquire the ability
[32:02] to provide wise counsel to others to
[32:06] understand a proverb in the
[32:07] interpretation the the words of the wise
[32:09] and their dark sayings seeming
[32:12] riddles and the next verse concludes the
[32:15] introduction and reason for the
[32:18] book the fear of the Lord is the
[32:21] beginning of
[32:23] knowledge but fools despise wisdom and
[32:27] instruction
[32:29] please be
[32:33] seated we see that the focus of this
[32:36] book is wisdom as well as knowledge you
[32:39] might think of wisdom as knowing when
[32:43] and how to apply knowledge to a given
[32:47] situation guiding principles on how to
[32:50] live one's life practical downto Earth
[32:54] advice such as soft answer turns away
[32:59] anger not esoteric Concepts like how
[33:02] many angels can fit on the head of a
[33:05] pin you may recall from last week that
[33:08] the books of job Psalms Proverbs
[33:11] Ecclesiastes and song of songs are
[33:14] grouped together in our Bibles and
[33:16] classified as wisdom or
[33:21] poetry before we dig into this Book of
[33:23] Proverbs let's step back a bit and take
[33:27] a look look at the Bible itself and in
[33:30] particular the collection of books that
[33:33] we refer to as the Old
[33:35] Testament while we were taking our study
[33:37] of the Bible in the form of an overview
[33:39] of each book in Order there's also the
[33:43] topic of the Bible itself the collection
[33:46] of books in this small Library which we
[33:51] call the Bible contains how and why are
[33:53] the various books arranged as they are
[33:56] in this collection in our Christian
[33:59] Bible the order of the books is quite
[34:01] different than in the Hebrew Bible known
[34:05] as the
[34:07] tanak if we think of each book as a tree
[34:11] the Bible represents the
[34:13] forest let's take a look at the forest
[34:16] for a few
[34:18] minutes we saw that the books from
[34:20] Genesis through job were narratives
[34:22] stories of people and events some were
[34:24] short like Ruth or Esther with a clear
[34:28] central figure whose life conveyed an
[34:30] important lesson others are much longer
[34:33] like genesis with a number of vignettes
[34:36] of people whose stories form a basis for
[34:40] our faith others like Exodus telling a
[34:43] much longer story of events not around
[34:46] not just a central figure like Moses but
[34:48] also of the people he was
[34:50] leading all the while God revealing
[34:54] himself through their lives their
[34:56] experiences their prophecies we caught
[34:59] glimpses of the character of God the
[35:02] character which God sought and in those
[35:04] glimpses we saw part of the character of
[35:07] God
[35:09] himself Psalms Proverbs Ecclesiastes
[35:13] song of songs are very different than
[35:16] the previous books they're not
[35:18] narratives of a history or focus on a
[35:21] central named figure brother Daniel did
[35:24] a masterful job last week giving us an
[35:26] overview of Psalm
[35:28] its breakdown and its theme
[35:32] worship I mentioned that in our
[35:34] Christian Bible the books of job Psalms
[35:37] Proverbs Ecclesiastes song of Psalms are
[35:39] grouped and classified as wisdom or
[35:41] typically called
[35:43] poetry well there are there are 39 books
[35:47] in our Old
[35:52] Testament the first five sometimes
[35:55] called the law are the Books of Moses
[35:59] also called The pentat Genesis Exodus
[36:02] Leviticus Numbers
[36:03] Deuteronomy Genesis tells from creation
[36:07] through the life of Joseph and sets the
[36:09] stage for everything that follows both
[36:12] Old and New Testaments the other four
[36:15] are centered around Moses and the events
[36:17] during his life with remarkable and
[36:19] unique displays of the supernatural
[36:21] power of God working on behalf of his
[36:25] people
[36:28] the next 12 are classified as history
[36:32] telling the story of the descendants of
[36:33] Israel from the death of Moses around
[36:35] 1406 BC through the return from
[36:38] captivity around 450 BC a period of
[36:41] nearly 1,000
[36:43] years Joshua Judges Ruth 1 and 2 Samuel
[36:47] 1 and 2 Kings first and second
[36:49] chronicles Ezra Nehemiah Esther
[36:57] the next group are the books of poetry
[37:00] job Psalms Proverbs
[37:03] Ecclesiastes Song of Songs or sometimes
[37:06] called Song of Solomon there's five
[37:09] books
[37:10] there that's followed by the prophets
[37:12] it's broken down into two sections the
[37:15] Major Prophets which are considered
[37:17] Major Prophets because they left a
[37:19] significant number of written prophecies
[37:21] Isaiah Jeremiah the Lamentations of
[37:24] Jeremiah Ezekiel and Daniel these are
[37:28] approximately in chronological
[37:30] order and lastly the Minor Prophets the
[37:33] last 12 books these are short focused
[37:38] again arranged in approximate
[37:39] chronological order Hosea Joel Amos
[37:42] Obadiah Jonah Mah nakum habak zani hegi
[37:46] Zakaria
[37:47] Malachi we're generally familiar with
[37:50] this arrangement in Sunday school that
[37:52] children are usually taught the names
[37:53] and Orders of these books our current
[37:56] series of Wednesday night bible studies
[37:59] is for the purpose of seeing what each
[38:01] book is about one of our goals is that
[38:05] you then take the time to read through
[38:07] each book and get not only a better
[38:10] grasp of its contents but allow the Lord
[38:14] to have the opportunity to speak to you
[38:17] through the
[38:19] text he texted us this is a love letter
[38:23] yes amen this is a love letter read it
[38:27] amen and and if you feel down go back to
[38:30] a part that really cheered you up and
[38:31] read it again it's a love letter it's
[38:35] from a living God to living people and
[38:38] we're living people because he gave us
[38:40] his
[38:43] life it's not about
[38:46] teaching it's about
[38:51] relationship in the Hebrew Bible the
[38:54] structure is quite different it has all
[38:56] the content of the Old Testament but
[38:59] it's comprised of only 24 books
[39:02] organized in three sections the Hebrew
[39:06] Bible is commonly called the
[39:08] Tanakh it's taken from the first letters
[39:11] of the Hebrew words for those three
[39:13] sections the T for Torah the five books
[39:17] of Moses the the laws we sometimes think
[39:19] of it the neim which means prophets
[39:24] which is the middle section and the
[39:26] final section the Kim which means
[39:30] writings Torah neim Kim the law the
[39:35] prophets and the writings those are the
[39:38] names of the three sections but let's
[39:40] let's take a closer look at
[39:44] this the first section is known as the
[39:46] Torah we often State this as the law but
[39:50] it's more generally means instruction or
[39:54] teaching these are the same five books
[39:56] attributed to Moses and in the same
[39:58] order as in our Old Testament though
[40:00] with radically different names for
[40:02] example what we call the Book of Numbers
[40:06] in Hebrew is called the midal which
[40:08] literally means in the desert put
[40:11] another way while we put titles on the
[40:13] books these Scrolls didn't have titles
[40:17] so they're referred to by something from
[40:19] the very first uh sentence are the very
[40:22] first
[40:23] words what we call Genesis they call
[40:26] bashit which means means in the
[40:28] beginning uh Exodus is called shamot
[40:32] because it starts out with a list of
[40:33] names shamot is Hebrew plural for names
[40:37] talked
[40:38] about Deuteronomy is called theim which
[40:42] means
[40:44] things
[40:46] things okay let's move on let let's go
[40:49] to the let's go to nevim the
[40:53] prophets it's divided typically into two
[40:56] parts what they call the earlier
[40:59] prophets uh Joshua Judges Samuel
[41:05] Kings recall that a prophet is one to
[41:08] whom the word of the Lord
[41:11] comes in these books we read of various
[41:14] prophets such as Nathan Elijah Deborah
[41:19] Samuel these are prophets who left us no
[41:22] written record of their
[41:24] prophecies we usually think of these
[41:26] books as history
[41:28] but they're considered and classified as
[41:30] prophets in the Hebrew Bible notice that
[41:33] Samuel and kings are one book not split
[41:36] into two parts they had pretty good siiz
[41:38] Scrolls I think then we get to the later
[41:41] or the latter prophets the second part
[41:44] these are also thought of as the writing
[41:47] prophets there are three major prophets
[41:50] those who wrote a lot Isaiah Jeremiah
[41:54] and Ezekiel and then the 12 that we
[41:56] think of of his Minor Prophets from
[41:59] Obadiah Amos Hosea through Malachi they
[42:03] didn't write so much and all 12 of them
[42:05] were contained in a single scroll and
[42:07] simply referred to often as the
[42:11] 12 which helps condense the number of
[42:14] books
[42:17] right notice that this while they're in
[42:20] the same order that we have they're not
[42:22] in the same place we end our Old
[42:24] Testament with the 12 Minor Prophets and
[42:26] the Hebrew Bible they're in the middle
[42:28] they're grouped with the prophets they
[42:30] don't end in
[42:32] Malachi the third and final part of the
[42:35] Tanakh contains the Kim the
[42:38] writings this collection of Scrolls is
[42:41] informally divided into three parts the
[42:44] first part is sometimes referred to as
[42:46] poetry but more often called
[42:48] wisdom now there's a there's a little
[42:50] bit of a play on words on letters here
[42:53] the things that uh rabbis really enjoy
[42:55] playing with
[42:57] and I thought maybe we'd play with it a
[42:59] little bit tonight
[43:01] ourself we have job here who really is
[43:05] shattering stereotypes if you're a good
[43:08] guy and do the right stuff nothing bad's
[43:10] ever going to happen to you
[43:12] wrong Psalms is about
[43:17] worship Proverbs is about
[43:20] wisdom
[43:22] well let's take just a little look at
[43:25] something here what my grandkids would
[43:28] call fun
[43:30] facts the first letters of the book of
[43:33] what we call job and Hebrew is EOB and
[43:37] it's represented by that funny thing
[43:39] that looks like an X that's a Hebrew
[43:41] letter
[43:42] Ola that's the very first letter in the
[43:45] alphabet if if you think in terms of
[43:47] Greek I'm sure you all think in terms of
[43:50] Greek right then that would be Alpha
[43:53] right okay the very first letter
[43:56] proverbs
[43:57] in Hebrew is mish and the letter
[44:01] meem is in the middle of the alphabet
[44:04] it's 22 letters so it can't be the you
[44:06] know the 10 and a half letter or
[44:08] something or the 11 and a half it's
[44:09] about the 13th but it's in the middle
[44:12] and Psalms to
[44:14] helim the letter Tav is the very last
[44:17] letter of the Hebrew alphabet think
[44:19] Alpha and Omega does that remind you of
[44:22] someone well these letters together
[44:26] spell the Hebrew word
[44:30] AMT so what brother L okay well let's
[44:35] take a look at that AMT is a Hebrew word
[44:39] for truth or
[44:42] wisdom and this word covers the whole
[44:44] Hebrew alphabet beginning to end alpha
[44:46] and omega as I said who did Jesus say he
[44:50] was Alpha and Omega he also said that he
[44:53] was the truth the Amit amen well one of
[44:58] my co-workers when I lived in Israel a
[45:00] half a century ago and worked at
[45:04] L which is the airline and Excuse me
[45:07] while I unpack my bag and baggage that I
[45:10] probably should have done earlier but
[45:13] but I didn't because I'm an old guy and
[45:15] sometimes I
[45:18] forget I I had a friend
[45:21] there and he told me something that that
[45:25] the rabbis said
[45:35] the word for truth or a Met if if you
[45:38] cut out these letters and and stand them
[45:40] up you'd
[45:42] find if I can do this the right
[45:46] way that they're
[45:53] stable they stand up they're strong they
[45:56] have a
[46:00] foundation
[46:05] okay for those of you that insist on
[46:07] sitting in the back if you can't see
[46:09] these very clearly remember
[46:12] binoculars opera glasses or sit
[46:16] closer okay but my my friend told me
[46:21] something else about this he said you
[46:23] know L he
[46:25] said the Hebrew word
[46:27] for lie or falsehood is
[46:31] shaker like many or most Hebrew words
[46:34] it's root consists of three letters in
[46:36] this case Shin K from these letters are
[46:39] all grouped at the very end of the
[46:40] Hebrew alphabet letters 19 through 21 of
[46:44] 22 unlike truth these letters have a
[46:47] narrow base if you cut them out and try
[46:50] to stand them up
[46:57] I I I can't do it they they don't stand
[47:00] up they're unstable they have to be
[47:01] supported you got to keep propping them
[47:07] up a li is
[47:10] unstable but then there's the truth
[47:13] Jesus is the truth the way and the life
[47:16] okay that little bit of stuff fun facts
[47:18] that was all free let's get back to the
[47:21] Tanakh the the next group of scrolls are
[47:25] called the megalot
[47:27] and that simply means Scrolls it's
[47:30] Hebrew word and these are the song of
[47:33] songs or Song of Solomon Ruth you notice
[47:37] is not placed historically but is placed
[47:40] here
[47:41] Lamentations
[47:43] Ecclesiastes and Esther these five
[47:46] scrolls are read each year During
[47:49] certain festivals or or
[47:52] observances Song of Songs is read on the
[47:55] Sabbath that occurs during the week of
[47:58] Passover it's interpreted as an
[48:00] allegorical expression of God's love for
[48:02] his people demonstrated by the Passover
[48:05] and by The
[48:06] Exodus this year it happened to be April
[48:10] 27 Ruth which we just covered
[48:15] recently is read on Shavuot anybody
[48:19] remember what Shavuot is those of you
[48:22] that speak Hebrew don't raise your hand
[48:24] oh then nobody's raising their hand okay
[48:26] well shev wot is the Feast of Weeks what
[48:29] do we call
[48:31] it Pentecost yes Harvest Time and that's
[48:36] a setting for the book for us the
[48:39] Redemption of a gentile bride maybe we
[48:41] should read it on Pentecost too it
[48:43] occurs on June 13 this year in
[48:46] Judaism but on the Christian calendar
[48:49] Pentecost is May 19th this
[48:54] Sunday lamentation
[48:57] very sad book wailing over the
[49:00] destruction of
[49:02] Jerusalem this is read on a on a day
[49:04] that's observed it's not a holiday it's
[49:07] not a day of Celebration it is a day of
[49:10] observance tesab AV means the ninth day
[49:13] of the month of a on the Hebrew calendar
[49:17] this is the date that in Jewish
[49:19] tradition and I believe historically as
[49:21] well that the first temple was destroyed
[49:23] in 586
[49:25] BC it's also the the date the ninth day
[49:28] of the Hebrew month of
[49:30] a that the second temple was destroyed
[49:32] in 70
[49:34] AD there's other disasters that have
[49:36] happened to the Jewish people over the
[49:39] years that seem to occur on this very
[49:42] same date in the Jewish calendar
[49:45] Lamentations is Jeremiah's lament over
[49:47] the destruction of Jerusalem and the
[49:49] temple under the Babylonians it falls on
[49:51] August 13 this
[49:54] year Ecclesiastes
[49:56] has read on the Sabbath of the week of
[49:58] sucot Tabernacles a reminder of the
[50:01] transitory and permanent nature of life
[50:04] just as the Tabernacles or booths or
[50:06] temporary structures and reminders of
[50:08] the years of wandering following The
[50:10] Exodus this year October 19th Esther is
[50:14] read on purm this book established the
[50:17] holidays we read two weeks ago it was on
[50:19] March 24th of this
[50:22] year the final three books are Daniel
[50:25] Ezra
[50:26] Ezra Nehemiah which is one book or
[50:29] scroll and Chronicles also one book
[50:32] these books are are called post exilic
[50:34] they mean after the Exile after the
[50:37] destruction uh after the people were
[50:40] scattered there their views are
[50:42] histories Daniel while certainly
[50:43] containing prophecies was written
[50:45] entirely in Exile in the section of the
[50:48] prophets the nebim were all written in
[50:51] the land of of promise even if they were
[50:53] post Exile Jewish tradition because I
[50:55] know most of you going to say wait a
[50:57] minute Ezekiel kind of starts out and
[50:58] says that he was by this Brook in
[51:00] Babylon Jewish tradition asserts that
[51:03] Ezekiel started his life as a prophet in
[51:06] Judah before the Exile while Daniel did
[51:09] not so we end while we end the Old
[51:13] Testament with Malachi a promise of a
[51:16] returning Elijah lest I come and smite
[51:18] the Earth with a curse the Hebrew chanak
[51:21] ends
[51:23] with 2 Chronicles for us second
[51:26] Chronicles
[51:27] 36:23 thus saith Cyrus King of
[51:31] Persia think he might be a type of
[51:34] Christ in this verse all the kingdoms of
[51:36] the earth hath the Lord God Of Heaven
[51:37] given me all power is given unto me in
[51:40] heaven and earth is what Jesus said and
[51:42] he hath charged me to build him an house
[51:44] in Jerusalem which is in Judah who is
[51:47] there among you of all his people the
[51:49] Lord is God be with him let him go up I
[51:52] just mentioned Pentecost is this Sunday
[51:56] what happened at
[51:59] Pentecost um hath charged me to build
[52:02] him an house in
[52:04] Jerusalem isn't that what we're supposed
[52:06] to be the temple of God the Holy Spirit
[52:09] came down the
[52:10] infilling it's just such a beautiful
[52:12] type and parallel so it ends on a note
[52:14] of Hope and restoration for the Jewish
[52:16] people and for us symbolic of the life
[52:19] of a Christian is a living Temple or
[52:21] house of the
[52:23] Lord well I'll end this rather lengthy
[52:25] sidebar
[52:27] about the structure of the Old Testament
[52:28] and to knock with two verses from the
[52:30] New Testament Gospel of
[52:33] Luke Jesus was familiar with the
[52:37] three-part structure and Order of the
[52:41] Tanakh in fact he referred to it when
[52:45] speaking with his followers gathered
[52:47] just before his
[52:48] Ascension let's read Luke 24:44 Jesus
[52:52] said unto
[52:54] them recall he's he's he's with uh his
[52:58] disciples this group of people and and
[53:00] he's asked for fish and a honeycomb and
[53:03] and he's eating and he said unto them
[53:06] these are the words which I spake unto
[53:07] you while I was yet with you that all
[53:10] things must be fulfilled which were
[53:13] written in the law of Moses
[53:16] tah and in the
[53:19] prophets
[53:20] Nim and in the Psalms Kim writings
[53:25] concerning me he wasn't just referring
[53:28] to a couple of things well Psalms he was
[53:30] referring to that part of the structure
[53:32] that's the lead book in that part of the
[53:35] structure then opened he their
[53:37] understanding that they might understand
[53:40] the
[53:40] scriptures when you read Luke 24 in the
[53:43] past I suspect you thought Jesus was
[53:45] referring to just a few books of the Old
[53:47] Testament but he was speaking of the
[53:49] entire Corpus of the Hebrew Bible the
[53:52] Old Testament and we know that to be
[53:55] true we see see Jesus Christ in every
[54:01] verse and kind of another little fun
[54:04] fact here Jesus was ever the
[54:07] teacher he was eating with him at this
[54:09] time Luke tells us he was eating fish
[54:11] and honeycomb now do you think he was
[54:14] kind of that's greasy oops honey from
[54:18] that honey you think he was standing up
[54:22] or do you think that he was probably
[54:23] seated at a table probably with the dish
[54:26] that to catch all the drippings while he
[54:28] was speaking whenever Jesus sits he's
[54:32] usually teaching not always and not only
[54:35] but The Sermon on the Mount sitting in a
[54:38] boat on the shore of the lake in the
[54:40] synagogue at Nazareth when he spoke
[54:42] about this day the scriptures fulfilled
[54:44] in your ears it says he read the
[54:45] scripture then he sat down all eyes were
[54:48] on him and he
[54:50] taught okay enough about
[54:52] structure let's get back to our topic
[54:54] ate you may be asking yourself
[54:56] self self Book of Proverbs what is a
[55:01] proverb glad you asked the American
[55:04] Heritage dictionary defines a proverb as
[55:07] a short piy saying and frequent and
[55:09] widespread use it expresses the basic
[55:11] truth or practical
[55:13] precept an old and common saying a
[55:16] phrase which is often repeated
[55:17] especially a sentence which briefly and
[55:20] forcibly expresses some practical truth
[55:23] or the result of experience and
[55:24] observation a maxim a saw an
[55:27] adage a striking or paradoxical
[55:30] assertion an obscure saying an enigma a
[55:35] parable as we'll see the Book of
[55:37] Proverbs is largely a collection of such
[55:39] short pithy
[55:41] sayings the Proverbs are presented using
[55:44] Hebrew parallelism to communicate its
[55:46] principles of wisdom it's very similar
[55:49] to the Psalms part of the reason it's
[55:51] called poetry as brother Daniel
[55:53] explained last
[55:54] week turns out there three basic kinds
[55:57] of parallelism employed repetition
[56:00] contrast completion we'll use examples
[56:03] of these in repetition or synonymous
[56:06] parallelism the second line of the
[56:08] proverb repeats the principle of the
[56:10] first line with different words a couple
[56:12] of examples Proverbs
[56:14] 1:2 to know wisdom and
[56:17] instruction to perceive to know the
[56:20] words of understanding wisdom and
[56:23] instruction it's saying the same thing
[56:25] using different words it's
[56:29] synonyms wisdom of course is not the
[56:31] same as knowledge wisdom is applying
[56:35] knowledge by means of understanding not
[56:38] just the facts but also the context in
[56:41] which you apply them Proverbs 16:18
[56:45] Pride goeth Before Destruction a hoty
[56:49] spirit before a fall again it's the same
[56:53] thing pride and a hotty Spirit are
[56:55] synonyms destruction and fall are
[56:58] synonyms making the same statement
[57:01] different words
[57:02] and this is advice and a
[57:06] warning Jesus talked about this
[57:09] humility that's that's what's going on
[57:11] here in contrasting or antithetical
[57:14] parallelism the second line States a
[57:16] principle by using a contrasting
[57:18] statement for example Proverbs 101 the
[57:21] Proverbs of Sol a wise son maketh a glad
[57:25] father
[57:27] but a foolish son is the heaviness of
[57:30] his mother wise and foolish are
[57:33] contrasted glad heaviness are contrasted
[57:36] father mother are
[57:40] contrasted
[57:42] lastly in completing or synthetic
[57:44] parallelism the second line completes
[57:46] the broad thought of the First with this
[57:48] specific Truth For example Proverbs 16:4
[57:51] the Lord hath made all things for
[57:54] himself then we come to down to focus
[57:56] and example yay even the wicked for the
[58:00] day of
[58:04] evil like Psalms The Book of Proverbs is
[58:06] broken into four sections the
[58:09] introduction is Proverbs 1: 1 through 7
[58:12] it was our opening set of verses the
[58:15] emphasis is the beginning of wisdom a
[58:17] key verse of that is 17 the fear of the
[58:21] Lord is the beginning of
[58:23] knowledge fools despise with wisdom and
[58:29] instruction the next section is us to
[58:31] refer to is the invitation inviting the
[58:35] people of wisdom it's Proverbs 1 18-918
[58:37] a key verse here is usually stated as
[58:40] Proverbs 35
[58:42] through6 for me personally this is the
[58:46] heart of the entire
[58:49] book trust in the Lord with all thine
[58:54] heart how much
[58:56] how much of your heart should be
[58:58] dedicated to trusting the
[59:00] Lord and lean not unto thine own
[59:04] understanding
[59:06] contrast trust him or trust
[59:11] yourself in all thy ways acknowledge
[59:16] Him and He Shall direct make straight
[59:21] thy paths you do the first three he'll
[59:24] do the fourth
[59:26] sounds
[59:28] easy but it's often not so
[59:31] easy the third section is often called
[59:35] the principles of wisdom Proverbs
[59:36] chapters 10- 29 a key verse here is
[59:40] perhaps uh
[59:43] 1412 there's a way that seems right unto
[59:47] a
[59:48] man but the end thereof are the ways of
[59:52] death
[59:56] the last section chapters 30 and 31
[1:00:00] emphasizing the practice of wisdom
[1:00:03] Chapter 30 is attributed to a person
[1:00:05] named agur and 31 to a King named Lemuel
[1:00:09] a key verse here is often considered to
[1:00:12] be Chapter 30 verse
[1:00:16] 4 who hath ascended up into heaven or
[1:00:20] descended who hath bound the waters in a
[1:00:24] garment who hath established all the
[1:00:26] ends of the
[1:00:28] Earth wow sounds like Paul sounds like
[1:00:32] job what is his name what is his son's
[1:00:35] name if you can
[1:00:37] tell Christian theologians will often
[1:00:40] point to this as for telling the Messiah
[1:00:42] as the son Jewish theologians will tell
[1:00:45] you that it refers to Israel Exodus 4:22
[1:00:48] says Thou shalt say unto Pharaoh thus
[1:00:50] saith the Lord Israel is my son even my
[1:00:54] firstborn
[1:00:57] Proverbs isn't about
[1:00:58] prophecy it's about how to live it's
[1:01:05] practical we read verses from chapter 31
[1:01:07] about the attributes of a virtuous woman
[1:01:09] in our opening for the Book of
[1:01:12] Esther the first 29 chapters of Proverbs
[1:01:15] are attributed to Solomon they represent
[1:01:18] but a small fraction of the Proverbs he
[1:01:21] is reported to have collected spoken or
[1:01:24] written and first First Kings we read
[1:01:27] this about his
[1:01:29] Proverbs First Kings 4:29 God gave
[1:01:32] Solomon wisdom and understanding
[1:01:35] exceeding much and largess of heart even
[1:01:37] as the sand that is on the seashore and
[1:01:39] Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of
[1:01:41] all the children of the East Country all
[1:01:44] the wisdom of Egypt he was wiser than
[1:01:46] all men than Ethan the ezrahite and hman
[1:01:49] and and chalal and Darda the sons of
[1:01:53] Mah who are those guys their names we
[1:01:56] don't recognize but they were apparently
[1:01:58] known for their wisdom in those days
[1:02:00] some 3,000 years ago and Solomon's Fame
[1:02:05] was in all nations roundabout and he
[1:02:07] spake
[1:02:09] 3,000
[1:02:11] Proverbs
[1:02:13] 3,000 these 29 chapters only have 851
[1:02:17] verses and not every one of them is a
[1:02:20] Proverbs so we have less than a
[1:02:22] quarter maybe only just a few percent of
[1:02:25] the proverbs
[1:02:26] that Solomon spoke and not only
[1:02:33] that somehow I deleted the next part of
[1:02:37] the line his songs were a
[1:02:41] th5 and he spake of trees from the cedar
[1:02:44] tree that is in Lebanon unto the hsip
[1:02:46] that springeth out of the wall he spake
[1:02:49] also of beasts and a fowl and creeping
[1:02:52] things and Fishes the lessons of nature
[1:02:55] of the world around us that the Lord
[1:02:57] created not just to express his variety
[1:03:00] but to teach us lessons about life not
[1:03:03] only the Majestic but the tiny a couple
[1:03:05] of years ago we spoke here one evening
[1:03:07] about the
[1:03:08] ant and there came of all people to hear
[1:03:12] the wisdom of Solomon from all Kings of
[1:03:14] the earth which had heard of his
[1:03:17] wisdom Solomon we just learned spoke
[1:03:20] many Proverbs he didn't necessarily
[1:03:23] originate all of them he didn't
[1:03:24] necessarily write them down or even had
[1:03:27] them placed in a written collection for
[1:03:28] example more than 200 years after
[1:03:30] Solomon's death we read in Proverbs
[1:03:33] 251 these are also Proverbs of Solomon
[1:03:37] which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah
[1:03:39] copied out transcribed compiled
[1:03:44] collected that was more than 200 years
[1:03:47] after Solomon passed away and that
[1:03:49] comprises the last five chapters that
[1:03:51] are attributed to Solomon Solomon is
[1:03:53] also credited with composing two of the
[1:03:55] Psalms two the books of the Bible
[1:03:57] Ecclesiastes and Song of Songs these
[1:04:00] will be the subjects of upcoming
[1:04:01] overviews of the books comprising the
[1:04:05] Bible we could spend the rest of the
[1:04:08] evening looking at some of the various
[1:04:11] Proverbs and you probably expect me to
[1:04:13] do just
[1:04:15] that Proverbs that tell how to
[1:04:18] deescalate tense
[1:04:20] situations or how to live a fruitful
[1:04:23] life what things to value in life
[1:04:26] how to conduct business how to control
[1:04:30] temper what happens if there's no
[1:04:34] vision and so
[1:04:37] on sorry to disappoint but I really want
[1:04:41] you to read this book at home during
[1:04:46] devotions meditation family discussion
[1:04:51] and conversation set time aside
[1:04:55] unlike much of the Bible these are
[1:04:57] mostly short mini lessons they contain
[1:05:02] succinct practical advice on life and
[1:05:06] how to live use the ESV or the NIV or
[1:05:10] some other translation if the King James
[1:05:13] English trips you up a little bit make
[1:05:18] time I'm busy brother Lyall I've got
[1:05:21] this and I've got that going on yeah i'
[1:05:24] I I know about busy
[1:05:26] Sunday night probably something about
[1:05:29] busy might come up David wrote in the
[1:05:32] Psalms 11
[1:05:34] 19 wherewith all shall a young man
[1:05:38] cleanse his way how how can a young
[1:05:40] person stay
[1:05:42] pure by taking heed thereto by guarding
[1:05:46] his way according to what Thy Word with
[1:05:51] my whole heart have I sought thee let me
[1:05:53] not Wander from thy
[1:05:57] Commandments and now a key how do I keep
[1:05:59] from wandering how do I guard my way Thy
[1:06:03] word have I hid in my
[1:06:06] heart why that I might not sin against
[1:06:10] thee wisdom application of knowledge of
[1:06:15] his word blessed art thou oh Lord teach
[1:06:18] me thy statute it's with my lips have I
[1:06:20] declared all the judgments of thy mouth
[1:06:23] I have rejoiced in the way of thy
[1:06:24] testimony as much as in all riches I
[1:06:28] will meditate in thy
[1:06:30] precepts and have respect unto thy
[1:06:35] ways set aside time read listen meditate
[1:06:42] pray I will Delight myself in thy
[1:06:45] statutes I will not forget Thy
[1:06:49] word we must not just learn and recite
[1:06:54] and quote we need to apply to
[1:07:00] live I presented an overview of the Old
[1:07:02] Testament the
[1:07:04] Tanakh The Book of Proverbs please read
[1:07:08] it let the Lord speak to you you don't
[1:07:11] need to hear my thoughts on
[1:07:18] it what lessons can we take home from
[1:07:21] Proverbs brother L you only read a few
[1:07:24] Proverbs read them at home amen read
[1:07:27] them at home did I say that read them at
[1:07:32] home we still have a little time this
[1:07:35] evening I want to emphasize the role of
[1:07:38] wisdom of applying our knowledge of the
[1:07:42] Lord in and to our
[1:07:45] lives brother Daniel I might be slipping
[1:07:48] into preacher of meddling here stop me
[1:07:52] at any
[1:07:53] time there's a couple of flashing red
[1:07:55] lights that I that I
[1:07:58] see first a personal
[1:08:02] note in 1968 I graduated from Flowing
[1:08:05] Wells High School here in
[1:08:07] Tucson there was a competition that year
[1:08:10] to see who would speak at
[1:08:13] commencement it wasn't going to be the
[1:08:15] person with the highest grade point
[1:08:17] average the valid
[1:08:19] Victorian I I prayed about this I
[1:08:22] submitted a speech for
[1:08:24] evaluation I came in
[1:08:26] second in a field of about 20
[1:08:28] submissions but somehow the people that
[1:08:31] printed the program oops and I was the
[1:08:35] lead speaker that evening I don't have a
[1:08:38] copy of the speech but I remember a
[1:08:40] couple of lines from it that I think
[1:08:41] apply to this evening's Bible
[1:08:44] study I said knowledge without
[1:08:48] wisdom is like religion without god wow
[1:08:53] today we are asked to to live with the
[1:08:56] curse of
[1:08:58] both tonight nearly 60 years later I
[1:09:01] think it's still true we need wisdom we
[1:09:04] must apply the knowledge that we have of
[1:09:07] God and his word in our lives not just
[1:09:10] quote it or debate it or explain it as
[1:09:14] brother Daniel said recently we need to
[1:09:16] have rivers of living water coming from
[1:09:19] us to help others if it's just for our
[1:09:22] own edification it's of little value
[1:09:25] it's not the example that we have from
[1:09:27] Joseph or Moses or Jesus or the apostles
[1:09:30] or brother
[1:09:32] bradam another flashing red light if you
[1:09:36] will is a sometimes preoccupation with
[1:09:39] what we often call The
[1:09:42] Rapture brother Daniel we
[1:09:45] didn't collude on this this evening but
[1:09:47] he read that scripture Paul wrote to the
[1:09:49] Corinthians to fight a doctrine that was
[1:09:51] being spread about the soon return of
[1:09:54] Jesus people were being taught that they
[1:09:57] had to be alive when Jesus came or
[1:10:00] they'd go to
[1:10:01] hell if you died you were doomed Paul
[1:10:04] says we're not as those without hope
[1:10:05] that's why they were as those without
[1:10:08] hope because they were told oh your dad
[1:10:10] died gosh I'm sorry he's going to hell
[1:10:12] he's not alive when Jesus comes so he
[1:10:15] was fighting that Doctrine so we rod and
[1:10:17] assured them that if they were alive at
[1:10:19] that moment as he himself expected to be
[1:10:21] he said then we which are alive they'd
[1:10:24] be transformed
[1:10:26] and so were we if we're alive at that
[1:10:29] time but if they died not to worry
[1:10:32] because the dead in Christ will rise
[1:10:36] first if you're his you won't miss it
[1:10:40] you can't miss it if you're his period
[1:10:45] so don't fret about it don't worry about
[1:10:47] it don't try to figure out when it will
[1:10:49] be or how it will take place it's yours
[1:10:53] if you're his
[1:10:56] a
[1:10:57] third final flashing real light that I
[1:11:02] think we can so often get
[1:11:04] sidetracked about when he is coming that
[1:11:07] we may forget why we are here faith in
[1:11:12] Christ isn't a fire insurance policy or
[1:11:15] a quick escape from our
[1:11:17] problems we should our life isn't only
[1:11:21] about studying the Bible or listening to
[1:11:23] recordings of sermons from years past we
[1:11:25] should do these things but never forget
[1:11:29] we're to live each day for him consider
[1:11:34] what Jesus had to say Luke 6 why call ye
[1:11:38] me Lord
[1:11:40] Lord and you don't do the things that I
[1:11:44] say Amen
[1:11:46] whosoever Number One Cometh to me and
[1:11:51] two heareth my sayings and three do doth
[1:11:56] them I will show you whom he is like
[1:11:58] he's like a man which built a house he
[1:12:01] dig deep he laid the foundation on a
[1:12:04] rock and when the flood arose the scam
[1:12:07] beat vehemently upon that house and
[1:12:09] could not shake it for it was founded
[1:12:12] upon a
[1:12:15] rock but he that
[1:12:18] heareth and doeth not is like a man that
[1:12:21] without a foundation built a house upon
[1:12:24] the Earth against which when the stream
[1:12:26] did beat
[1:12:27] vehemently immediately it fell and the
[1:12:31] ruin of that house was
[1:12:33] great in Sunday school we used to sing
[1:12:36] the wise man built his house upon a rock
[1:12:39] the rains came down and the floods came
[1:12:42] up right James summed this up in a
[1:12:46] proverb likee
[1:12:48] statement he
[1:12:50] said but be ye doers of the word and not
[1:12:55] hearers
[1:12:56] only why because if you don't do he
[1:13:02] says you are deceiving your own
[1:13:07] selves we used to sing a song about
[1:13:10] ready to
[1:13:11] leave I think maybe we need to change
[1:13:15] that to ready to
[1:13:17] live these Proverbs are words to apply
[1:13:21] to help us live in a way that's God
[1:13:24] pleasing
[1:13:26] we just read that Jesus said you can't
[1:13:28] say he is Lord if you don't do not just
[1:13:32] know or hear or claim to have a
[1:13:34] revelation but do what he
[1:13:38] says my daughter-in-law Siobhan shared a
[1:13:43] short video clip with me some years ago
[1:13:45] from a minister named Francis Chan some
[1:13:49] of you may have seen this I wasn't
[1:13:51] confident that I could embed it in my
[1:13:53] slide so I'll retell it
[1:13:56] now that I've acknowledged the source so
[1:13:57] I'm not plagiarizing this came from
[1:13:59] Francis Chan
[1:14:01] okay
[1:14:03] imagine imagine I'm 30 years younger I
[1:14:07] have
[1:14:08] hair a smaller belly yeah a real stretch
[1:14:11] of your imagination and I have children
[1:14:13] and they're
[1:14:14] teens I peek into my son's
[1:14:20] bedroom it's a real mess I tell him go
[1:14:23] clean your room
[1:14:26] he comes to me a few hours later big
[1:14:29] smile on his face and he says and great
[1:14:32] expectation dad I memorized what you
[1:14:35] said to me you said Lyle one one go
[1:14:37] clean your
[1:14:40] room I'm not going to respond wow son
[1:14:43] good job that's what I
[1:14:46] wanted it's not going to cut it he can't
[1:14:49] come to me and say Dad I learned to say
[1:14:52] go clean your room in Greek and Hebrew
[1:14:54] and in
[1:14:56] Spanish or dad my friends and I are
[1:15:00] going to gather every week and study and
[1:15:03] imagine what it would look like if I
[1:15:05] were to clean my
[1:15:08] room or listen I've set this to music
[1:15:12] I've added some verses in the chorus and
[1:15:14] the title is go clean your
[1:15:17] room would I accept these would you of
[1:15:21] course not there's no mystery here it's
[1:15:24] plain and simple black and white just go
[1:15:26] clean the
[1:15:28] room so why should we expect God to
[1:15:32] accept it from us to talk and sing and
[1:15:36] recite but not
[1:15:38] do the musicians would please
[1:15:41] come we've just read where Jesus said
[1:15:45] how can you call me Lord and not do what
[1:15:49] I say in Matthew's gospel we read not
[1:15:54] every one that saith unto me Lord Lord
[1:15:58] shall enter into the kingdom of
[1:16:01] heaven but the one who will enter in is
[1:16:04] he that doeth the will of My Father
[1:16:08] which is in heaven so we need to learn
[1:16:11] and to apply to turn knowledge into
[1:16:16] wisdom put it into practice and we know
[1:16:20] it it doesn't stop there that that's
[1:16:22] part one Jesus continues many will say
[1:16:25] to me in that day Lord Lord we
[1:16:28] prophesied in your name in your name
[1:16:30] we've cast out devils in your name we've
[1:16:32] done many wonderful Works Lord look we
[1:16:34] are
[1:16:36] doers I will profess to them here comes
[1:16:40] part two I never knew
[1:16:43] you depart from me ye that work
[1:16:48] iniquity in addition to doing what he
[1:16:52] says we must have that relation a ship
[1:16:55] with him such that he knows
[1:16:59] us
[1:17:01] otherwise this book we call the Bible is
[1:17:05] just
[1:17:06] philosophy and its
[1:17:08] practices simply
[1:17:11] religion
[1:17:13] know listen
[1:17:16] apply from the heart brother Aaron
[1:17:19] Brother Daniel
[1:17:27] bless
[1:17:30] brother I'm going to
[1:17:33] live the
[1:17:36] way he wants me to live I'm going to
[1:17:43] give until there's just no more to give
[1:17:51] I'm going to
[1:17:53] love love till there's just no more
[1:18:00] love I could
[1:18:02] never never how love the
[1:18:09] Lord I'm going to
[1:18:12] live the
[1:18:14] way he wants me to live I'm going to
[1:18:21] give until there's
[1:18:25] no more to give I'm going to
[1:18:31] love love till there's just no more
[1:18:38] love I could
[1:18:40] never never love the Lord amen as always
[1:18:48] I appreciate brother ly
[1:18:51] and his wisdom
[1:18:55] and how he puts these together I
[1:18:58] appreciate the variety too brother ly
[1:19:00] and I approach things in different
[1:19:02] ways but we both love to study the word
[1:19:05] and I think it gives us a good variety
[1:19:08] as far as a congregation brother ly said
[1:19:12] this and this is a
[1:19:16] proverb I believe was that your
[1:19:18] commencement ceremony that you
[1:19:22] erroneously got to give the first one
[1:19:25] but this is wisdom I believe is the
[1:19:26] Lord's will knowledge without wisdom is
[1:19:29] like religion without
[1:19:33] God very profound statement as with all
[1:19:37] of these Proverbs brother Lyall also
[1:19:39] said
[1:19:41] tonight he said that instead of reading
[1:19:45] these
[1:19:46] Proverbs he said get together with your
[1:19:51] family and you read them and you discuss
[1:19:56] them the way that the Proverbs are
[1:19:58] written you don't have to read a whole
[1:20:00] chapter to know what's going on many
[1:20:02] times you just have to read one or two
[1:20:04] verses and that's the way that they're
[1:20:06] written that we can go in and pull the
[1:20:08] wisdom out of these Proverbs the Psalms
[1:20:11] is the same way that that it's written
[1:20:14] that you can just go into Psalms you can
[1:20:16] jump anywhere into the book and then you
[1:20:18] can pull that wisdom and worship out of
[1:20:22] the Psalms and it's the same with the
[1:20:23] Proverbs you can go and you can pull it
[1:20:26] right out of this book and then you can
[1:20:29] have an hourlong discussion with your
[1:20:31] family I just opened it up I had it
[1:20:34] underlined in in the
[1:20:37] Proverbs it says
[1:20:40] this it says a
[1:20:42] fool utth all his mind but a wise man
[1:20:47] keepeth keepeth it until
[1:20:51] afterwards I was
[1:20:53] thinking that's a a good discussion to
[1:20:55] have as a
[1:20:57] family it's good for
[1:20:59] Dad or Mom to get the kids around and
[1:21:03] say now look at this read
[1:21:05] this always be careful what you say and
[1:21:08] always be careful how you act still say
[1:21:12] what you're going to say but you can
[1:21:14] wait until the
[1:21:16] end you we could have a great
[1:21:20] discussion about about these this wisdom
[1:21:23] that's in the Proverbs and as brother
[1:21:24] Lyall
[1:21:25] said I encourage you to do it sit down
[1:21:29] with your husband with your wife with
[1:21:31] your kids with your
[1:21:34] friend with whoever it is if you if you
[1:21:37] know somebody that's that's in another
[1:21:39] part of the country and you want to
[1:21:41] fellowship with them open this book and
[1:21:44] anywhere it says right here where there
[1:21:46] is no vision the people
[1:21:48] perish but he he that keepeth the law is
[1:21:53] happy
[1:21:56] and I'm just looking everywhere in here
[1:21:59] iron sharpens iron so a man so a man
[1:22:03] sharpens the countenance of his
[1:22:06] friend that's this book so take brother
[1:22:10] ly's
[1:22:11] advice study this talk about it pick one
[1:22:16] out talk about it with your family enjoy
[1:22:19] it it's what it's for and then apply it
[1:22:23] to your life will you do it I think it
[1:22:26] would be good for us to do
[1:22:28] it I think it'd be good for families to
[1:22:31] do it let's all
[1:22:34] stand
[1:22:36] there it would be like driving down the
[1:22:39] the road and there's a speed limit and
[1:22:43] you obey it and everybody's zipping
[1:22:47] around you and angry at you until the
[1:22:49] police pulls them
[1:22:52] over but you youve kept your place where
[1:22:55] you should be
