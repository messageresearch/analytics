[1:59] Amazing grace all day long. Christ Jesus
[2:04] paid a debt that I could never

[2:34] Daniel's going to have a lot to say
[2:35] about that. Let's just sing and worship
[2:38] the Lord with all our hearts this
[2:40] morning. Isn't he wonderful?
[2:43] Isn't he
[2:45] wonderful?
[2:47] Wonderful.
[2:48] Wonderful. Isn't Jesus my Lord?
[2:54] Wonderful. Eyes have seen, ears have
[2:58] heard what's recorded in God's word.
[3:02] Isn't Jesus, my Lord? Wonderful. Isn't

[3:53] in Jesus my Lord. Wonderful. He abides
[3:59] and he
[4:01] abides. He
[4:05] abides. Hallelujah. He abides with me.
[4:12] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[4:16] the narrow way for the comfort. Verse
[4:20] one. Brother
[4:21] Jordan, I'm
[4:23] rejoicing. I'm rejoicing night and day
[4:28] as I walk the narr way for the hand of
[4:32] God. In all my life I
[4:36] see. Well, and the reason of my bliss.
[4:40] Yes. The secret all is this. That the
[4:45] comforter abides with me. He abides. Oh,
[4:50] he
[4:52] abides. He
[4:55] abides. Hallelujah. He abides with me.
[5:02] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[5:07] the narrow way. For the comforter abides
[5:12] with
[5:14] me. And once my heart was full of sin.
[5:18] Once I had no peace within till I heard
[5:23] how Jesus died upon that tree.
[5:28] Then I fell down at his feet and there
[5:32] came a peace so sweet. Now the comforter
[5:36] abides with
[5:40] me. He
[5:43] abides. He
[5:46] abides. Hallelujah. He abides with me.
[5:53] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[5:58] the narrow way for the comforter. He
[6:02] abides. Let's sing that again. He
[6:05] abides. Oh, he
[6:08] abides. He
[6:11] abides. Hallelujah. He abides with me.
[6:19] My rejoice in night and day as I walk
[6:23] the narrow way for the comforter abides
[6:28] with me. He's with me everywhere. Let's
[6:30] sing it. Oh, he is with me
[6:34] everywhere. And he knows my every care.
[6:38] I'm as happy as a bird and just as
[6:43] free for the spirit has control. Jesus
[6:48] satisfies my soul since the comforter
[6:53] abides with. Let's all stand together
[6:55] and sing it. He
[6:59] abides. He
[7:01] [Music]
[7:02] abides. Halleluah. He abides with me.
[7:10] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[7:14] the narrow way. For the comforter
[7:18] abides, I'm rejoicing night and
[7:21] day. I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[7:26] walk the narrow
[7:29] way. Praise
[7:34] God. And the reason of my bliss. Yes.
[7:38] The secret all is this that the
[7:42] comforter abides with
[7:47] me. Praise his name. Glory to
[7:51] God. They say that the three most uh
[7:54] attended church days in the year are
[7:58] Christmas in third place, Easter in
[8:01] second place, and Mother's Day in first
[8:02] place above Christmas and Easter. And
[8:06] Christmas people are out of town a lot.
[8:07] So that's why it's not necessarily the
[8:09] most full. Easter's usually pretty full.
[8:12] But Mother's Day is higher than all of
[8:14] them because people have respect for
[8:16] their
[8:16] mothers. But how much more the God that
[8:19] gave you a mother and gave you a loving
[8:21] mother? Where would you be without
[8:24] him? Anyway, I just want I just shared
[8:27] that with brother Daniel. He said I
[8:28] could share that with you this morning.
[8:30] Go ahead and shake someone's hand. Tell
[8:32] them God bless you. Tell them happy
[8:33] Mother's Day. No longer slaves.
[8:38] [Music]

[13:16] sea.
[13:19] Oh
[13:20] yes, you split the sea so I could walk
[13:26] right through
[13:28] it. My fears are drowned in perfect
[13:33] love.
[13:36] Hallelujah. You rescued me so I can
[13:40] stand and
[13:42] say that I am a child. You split the
[13:47] sea.
[13:50] Oh yes. You split the sea so I could
[13:56] walk right through it. My fears were
[14:01] drowned in perfect
[14:03] love. You rescued me.
[14:07] You rescued me so I can stand and
[14:13] say that I am a
[14:17] child of God. I'm no longer and I'm no
[14:24] longer a

[14:28] [Music]
[14:30] fear. Oh, I am a
[14:34] child of God. If the brothers want to
[14:37] come forward and open in prayer, I'm no

[15:04] Oh, I am a

[15:13] God bless you all. We're all children of
[15:16] God. We're all part of the same family.
[15:19] And we're united together this morning
[15:21] to to honor our Lord, to worship him.
[15:24] And today's a very special day because
[15:26] it's Mother's Day. And none of us would
[15:29] be here without a mother. So, we're very
[15:32] very grateful for for the mothers that
[15:34] we've had in our lives. Prayer requests
[15:37] this morning. Brother Ed Dooall is going
[15:39] to have a little cancer thing removed
[15:41] from uh from his head uh on Tuesday. So,
[15:45] keep him in prayer for that. And his
[15:47] sister Lorie Snow in Canada is still in
[15:50] critical condition. And she's in one of
[15:52] those situations where she's very
[15:53] susceptible to getting blood clots, but
[15:55] they can't give her any blood thinner
[15:57] because of other issues that she has
[15:59] right now. So, it's one of those things
[16:01] where it really requires the Lord's
[16:02] intervention. They're waiting for a slot
[16:04] to open up in the Phoenix area for her
[16:07] to be able to move from Washington State
[16:09] down to Phoenix for continued therapy
[16:12] and so forth. We want to continue to
[16:14] keep our sister in prayer. And also our
[16:16] brother Cleo Salazar who's here this
[16:18] morning but had that leg amputation a
[16:21] couple of weeks ago. But we just want to
[16:23] keep praying that the Lord would deliver
[16:24] him from pain and that everything would
[16:27] shape properly so when the prosthetic is
[16:29] fitted that it would just uh go smoothly
[16:31] and well. We just because a prayer
[16:32] request just brought up every service
[16:35] doesn't mean that we shouldn't continue
[16:36] to pray for each one of those people and
[16:38] each one of those needs. We're family.
[16:40] We feel each other's pain. We support
[16:42] each other. That's why we're here.
[16:44] That's why we're a body of Christ. Let's
[16:46] go to the Lord this morning in prayer.
[16:48] Lord Jesus, we're so grateful, Lord.
[16:51] Grateful that we can honor you on this
[16:53] day of your resurrection, Lord. Grateful
[16:55] that we can gather together, Lord, in
[16:57] respect and honor of our mothers that
[16:59] have brought us into this life, Lord,
[17:01] and raised us and trained us, Lord.
[17:04] Father, we're just so grateful for our
[17:06] families, Lord, and for each one, Lord.
[17:08] And each journey that we've had, it's
[17:10] been different for each one of us, Lord.
[17:12] But but we're just grateful that you've
[17:14] brought us to this place and brought us
[17:15] together this morning. We pray you'd
[17:17] anoint our pastor, brother Daniel, Lord,
[17:20] as he brings your word to us this
[17:21] morning, Lord. That you'd encourage our
[17:23] hearts, Lord. Those of us that need
[17:24] encouragement, Lord, that you'd
[17:26] strengthen those that need strength,
[17:28] Lord, and that you'd just continue to
[17:30] draw us together into the love of Jesus
[17:32] Christ. We pray for again for these
[17:34] needs. We we thank you, Lord, because we
[17:36] believe that you have intervened in each
[17:38] and every case, Lord, and that you will
[17:40] intervene in the future cases, Lord. And
[17:42] we're just grateful that we can call
[17:44] upon your name in this hour and to know
[17:47] you as our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[17:50] as the offering is taken this morning,
[17:52] Lord, that the funds would be used,
[17:53] Lord, to further your purposes, to
[17:55] further your gospel, Lord, to reach out
[17:57] and bring others into his saving
[17:58] knowledge of Jesus Christ. That's why
[18:01] we're here. We thank you, Lord, for
[18:02] everything in Jesus precious name.
[18:06] Amen. Oh, and we have a praise. Sister
[18:11] Amelia says uh that her son is out of
[18:13] the hospital. He's doing a lot better.
[18:15] Thank you for your prayers. That was her
[18:17] her son Fabian that the announcement was
[18:19] put out a couple of days ago. So, God
[18:22] bless you.
[18:28] Praise him. You can all have your seats.
[18:31] It is well with my soul. When peace like
[18:34] a river attendeth my way.
[18:38] When
[18:40] peace
[18:41] like a
[18:45] river
[18:49] attended my way.
[18:51] [Music]
[18:53] When
[18:56] sorrows like
[18:58] sea
[19:00] billows
[19:03] roll, whatever my
[19:06] lot,
[19:10] whatever my
[19:12] lot, thou hast
[19:15] taught me to say.
[19:20] It is
[19:23] well. It is
[19:26] well
[19:27] with my soul. Though Satan should buff
[19:32] [Music]
[19:33] it. Though
[19:38] Satan should
[19:40] buff it, though
[19:44] trial should come.
[19:49] Let
[19:50] this bless
[19:54] assurance
[19:57] [Music]
[20:00] control that
[20:03] Christ
[20:04] hath
[20:07] regarded my
[20:11] helpless
[20:13] state and had
[20:16] shed his own

[32:19] Lord. Father, receive our worship. I

[35:04] uncle, right? Yeah. It's it's good to
[35:06] see you in
[35:09] service. And then and then I see a few
[35:12] other visitors. Welcome to everyone. God
[35:14] bless you. It's good to have you. It's
[35:17] good to have you in service. I um I want
[35:19] to spend if the Lord's willing, I'd like
[35:21] to spend the first half of service going
[35:25] over some of the recent things going on
[35:27] with the Pope and uh with kind of the
[35:30] religious community throughout the
[35:32] world. And then after about 30 minutes
[35:36] or so, 20 minutes, 20 to 30 minutes,
[35:39] then we'll go into our normal Mother's
[35:41] Day service. But I thought seeing that
[35:44] boy there's been a lot of quotes going
[35:46] around and and a lot of talk and a lot
[35:49] of excitement about this new pope and I
[35:52] thought it would be right for me to
[35:55] address some of the things for our
[35:57] church for the visitors and for maybe
[36:00] some of the newer people the um these
[36:04] these quotes and I'll explain it a
[36:06] little bit further but these quotes have
[36:08] been going around from quotes from
[36:10] brother William Brham
[36:12] from the early 1950s, one quote in
[36:15] particular that has resurfaced and it's
[36:18] pretty amazing what was said. So, I'll
[36:21] I'll be talking about that a little bit
[36:24] later. And
[36:26] um I uh I just always want to use
[36:31] caution. I don't want to just jump at
[36:34] something. I preached on Saul, King
[36:36] Saul, this past w Wednesday night. One
[36:38] of Saul's biggest weaknesses was he made
[36:41] hasty decisions. We have to be careful
[36:44] with that. I have a letter in my
[36:46] office from uh from a lady. She gave it
[36:48] to me about this time last
[36:51] year and she told me, she said, "You
[36:55] need to take this letter and you need to
[36:57] read it before the congregation. You got
[36:59] to warn everybody of what's going to
[37:01] happen." She and she told me, she says,
[37:04] "This is a man who who's a prophet and
[37:07] and he wrote this and we have to warn
[37:10] the people of Tucson that there's going
[37:12] to be a terrorist attack in
[37:14] Tucson by the end of
[37:17] July." And she said, "You need to read
[37:19] this in front of the church." And I
[37:22] said, I said, "No." I said, "I'm not
[37:24] going to read it in front of the
[37:26] church." I said, "But I will hold you
[37:30] responsible and this man that signed
[37:34] this letter responsible if this does not
[37:38] come to pass." And that was last
[37:41] July. And she says, she says,
[37:46] "Okay." And obviously it didn't. So, we
[37:50] need to be very very
[37:51] careful in getting worked up and and and
[37:56] believing things that may not be true or
[37:59] may be true. I I know that many of you
[38:01] have heard the predictions made by a a
[38:05] minister in Texas named John Hegy about
[38:08] the blood moons in 2014 and
[38:12] 2015 and how that they corresponded with
[38:15] the Jewish feast days and that spread
[38:18] throughout the faith that these were the
[38:21] beginning of the end times and many
[38:22] people got caught up in
[38:25] it and nothing
[38:28] happened. And I've heard with my own
[38:31] ears a pastor who many of you probably
[38:33] knew say that Hillary Clinton would
[38:36] become would become president. And if
[38:39] this didn't happen that you could put a
[38:41] a sign false prophet on the back of on
[38:43] his back. And yet he wasn't taken to
[38:47] task over these when it didn't happen.
[38:49] And I guess she's not dead yet. I guess
[38:51] it still could
[38:54] happen. You laugh. I pray it
[38:57] doesn't. And there's always, friends,
[38:59] there's always a red heer in Israel.
[39:01] I've been hearing this since I was a
[39:02] little kid. Every time a new pope's
[39:05] elected and we we have some numbers that
[39:08] line up with his name or some idea about
[39:11] who he is and it when it doesn't just
[39:13] work out the way that we said, we forget
[39:16] about about what was told to us and then
[39:19] we just move on to the next fantastic
[39:21] thing.
[39:24] Many of the old
[39:26] folks remember all the craziness that
[39:30] surrounded
[39:31] 1977. Brother Lyle back there, brother
[39:33] Aaron have told me many stories about
[39:35] how everything was going to end by
[39:38] 1977. And and all the elders, many not
[39:41] just them, but many of you can testify
[39:43] and nothing
[39:45] happened. And yet these people that
[39:47] prophesied those things and said those
[39:49] things were not taken to task over
[39:51] these. They weren't called out. The
[39:54] Bible tells us that no one knows when
[39:58] Jesus will return, including even Jesus
[40:00] himself. It'll be a time when we don't
[40:03] think it'll probably be a normal time
[40:05] when no one is expecting it. So, he
[40:08] tells us to always be
[40:10] ready.
[40:12] However, Jesus said, "Beware of false
[40:15] prophets that come to you in sheep's
[40:17] clothing, but inwardly they are ravening
[40:20] wolves.
[40:22] and you shall know them by their fruits.
[40:26] So what is the fruit of a false prophet?
[40:29] It's a false prediction. It's a false
[40:32] prophecy. So that's how we will know a
[40:35] false prophet. And my point in saying
[40:37] this is to always use caution in
[40:39] interpretating in interpreting prophecy
[40:42] or interpreting world events. The Bible
[40:45] warns us of false prophets that would
[40:47] arise and deceive many. And when a
[40:49] pastor or when a minister says something
[40:52] that says takes a modern event and say
[40:55] that it fulfills prophecy, I believe
[40:57] that that person must be held to his
[40:59] predictions.
[41:01] And don't just move on to the next
[41:03] prediction when it doesn't
[41:04] happen. I'm not saying this to tell you
[41:07] to stop talking about these things. Not
[41:09] not at all. But use caution in your
[41:12] minds and in your words and in making
[41:16] predictions or interpreting scripture.
[41:17] It's easy to set ourselves out of God's
[41:21] plan by the things that we believe to be
[41:24] true. And then if it doesn't happen,
[41:26] then we just go on to the next thing.
[41:28] But the Bible does also say that there
[41:30] will be signs in the skies and there
[41:32] will be signs in the earth and there'll
[41:34] be that false prophets are to rise and
[41:36] to watch for these things as the end
[41:38] draws near. It says
[41:40] that and one of the signs of the end is
[41:43] not just earthquakes. It's not just wars
[41:45] and rumors of wars, but it is false
[41:48] prophets that would deceive many. And
[41:51] it's not just the pope. It's not just
[41:53] the local Catholic priest. They are
[41:57] everywhere according to the words of
[42:01] Jesus. Now, what has happened? With that
[42:04] said, I also don't want to underestimate
[42:06] the the turn of events that just
[42:09] happened in this past week. I never want
[42:11] to underestimate the
[42:13] importance. The United States right now
[42:15] is in a transitional period with the
[42:17] current president. I think that we are
[42:19] either going to come out of this a much
[42:21] better country or we're going to come
[42:23] out much
[42:25] worse.
[42:27] And all of
[42:29] this that's going on, it sounds good.
[42:33] We're going to dominate in oil
[42:34] production and in natural natural gas
[42:37] and drill, baby drill, and our economy
[42:41] will dominate and our buying power power
[42:43] will be greater than ever before. Our
[42:45] industry will climb back up because of
[42:48] the tariffs that we're imposing on these
[42:50] other countries and the money that that
[42:53] uh the government is saving by
[42:54] dismantling much of the government that
[42:57] is going to be used and put into
[42:59] national defense. So, we'll have more
[43:02] stealth aircraft, fighter jets, and
[43:05] we'll have long range nucle more long
[43:07] range nuclear missiles and more
[43:09] technology. And we are going to have a
[43:11] much more powerful military if we take
[43:14] the money that's being put into other
[43:15] things and put it into this. And it
[43:18] sounds really
[43:20] good. And it's the hope of this
[43:22] administration to do that and to be very
[43:24] successful.
[43:27] And for the first
[43:29] time in modern history, the most
[43:32] powerful religious man on earth, the
[43:36] pope, is now from now from the same
[43:41] place as the most powerful military and
[43:46] economic man in the president of the
[43:49] United States. Both are from the same
[43:53] country.
[43:54] And if you look at
[43:57] this, this
[44:00] pope seems to be like a people's pope.
[44:04] He's just full of charisma, full of
[44:07] personality, and he's I believe he's
[44:10] going to be well-liked by both Catholics
[44:12] and by non-atholics alike. And he's
[44:14] American. And just being an American
[44:17] brings a certain amount of respect. If
[44:19] any of you have been
[44:22] overseas, just being an American
[44:26] automatically gets you attention and
[44:28] gets you
[44:29] respect. But look, and then this man
[44:33] that became pope, he take he took on a
[44:36] very very strong name in Leo.
[44:40] Pope Leo I may have been the most
[44:43] militant and ruthless point pope to that
[44:47] point by 447. I mean it was right at the
[44:51] beginning this Pope Leo I 447 he
[44:54] declared that heretics deserve the most
[44:57] severe
[44:58] punishment. The pope justified the death
[45:01] penalty declaring that if the followers
[45:02] of heresy were allowed to
[45:05] live then that would end human and
[45:08] divine law.
[45:10] Unfortunately, heresy is usually usually
[45:12] defined by the church and those people
[45:15] were to be severely punished. Then
[45:17] another Leo, Leo I 10th, wrote a
[45:22] bull against Martin Luther. And if you
[45:25] hear me preach very often, I refer to
[45:27] Martin Luther often. He's one of the I
[45:29] believe one of the greatest people
[45:30] that's ever lived. I don't of course I
[45:31] don't agree with him in a lot of his
[45:33] dark doctrines, but he was a great great
[45:36] man. And this Pope Leo I 10th wrote this
[45:39] with advice and consent of of our
[45:41] venerable brothers with mature
[45:43] deliberation on each and every one of
[45:46] the above thesis and by the authority of
[45:49] the almighty God the blessed apostles
[45:51] Peter and Paul and our own authority we
[45:54] condemn repurbate and reject completely
[45:58] each of these thesis
[45:59] according or thesis or errors as either
[46:03] heretical scandalous false, offensive to
[46:07] pious years, or seductive of simple
[46:10] minds and against the Catholic Church.
[46:12] He's speaking of Martin Luther's 95
[46:14] thesis. By listing them, we decree and
[46:17] declare that all faithful of both sexes
[46:19] must regard them as condemned,
[46:22] reprobate, and rejected. We restain all
[46:25] the virtue. We restrain all the virtue
[46:28] of the holy obedience and under the
[46:29] penalty of an automatic major
[46:33] excommunication.
[46:35] speaking of this Pope Leo I 10th,
[46:38] speaking of this man Martin
[46:40] Luther. And this is the name that was
[46:44] taken by this current
[46:45] pope. And now with nuclear power and
[46:49] missiles that we can destroy anything on
[46:53] the face of the earth now in just a few
[46:55] minutes. The military power of this
[46:58] United States and the economic power and
[47:01] now with social media and with
[47:03] television, the
[47:05] Pope, something that comes from the Pope
[47:07] can travel the religious world really at
[47:10] the speed of
[47:11] light and go around the world. There has
[47:15] never been more far-reaching religious
[47:17] power than there is today. Now a country
[47:20] has risen to the ultimate power never
[47:24] seen in history. This United States, is
[47:27] it significant? Yes, I believe it is.
[47:32] What does it mean and what it's going to
[47:34] end up at? I have my ideas and my
[47:37] thoughts, but I don't want to be a
[47:39] foolish person to come up here and say
[47:42] because this lines up with this and this
[47:44] and this that this is what it is and
[47:46] then risk me being a false prophet and
[47:50] trying to interpret this to a group of
[47:51] people that love me and respect me. I
[47:54] would never want to do that. But this is
[47:56] a significant time in history. It's
[47:58] something that's never happened before.
[48:02] We we look back at at history and we see
[48:05] that
[48:07] that God made Adam and Eve. Then 2,000
[48:09] years later, he set this lineage in
[48:11] order with Abraham. And and he he used
[48:14] this to write his word and and to be his
[48:16] people. Then that went on for 2,000
[48:19] years. Then he brought his son, Jesus
[48:20] Christ. And and right after that had
[48:23] happened, the the Jews rejected the
[48:27] message of Christ. And then it went
[48:29] around the world to the Gentiles. There
[48:30] was a gentile dispensation there. Now
[48:32] 2,000 years, it's time for a major
[48:35] change on earth. And we see now we see
[48:38] Israel back into their
[48:41] homeland. These things should not be
[48:43] ignored. These things are signs of the
[48:46] end. Now, concerning this pope and the
[48:49] pro prophecy of the United
[48:51] States, I'm running out of
[48:54] time. I'll go fast.
[48:58] Uh when I heard this, the first thing I
[49:02] did is I started seeing the quotes and
[49:05] the stuff going around. First thing I
[49:07] did is I just went into my den, sat back
[49:10] in my chair. I got quiet before the
[49:14] Lord and I said, "Father, is is
[49:16] everything
[49:18] okay? Should we do something different?
[49:21] What should we do different? If if
[49:22] anything, what is your will? what is
[49:25] right in
[49:28] this. So I listened to that sermon that
[49:31] the quotes that are going
[49:34] around that
[49:37] um that it comes from and uh it's it's
[49:42] from a a sermon titled Acts of the Holy
[49:44] Spirit. And it's the same
[49:46] doctrine brother Brandham has always
[49:48] tried to bring. Accept Christ as your
[49:49] savior. Serve him. Have faith in him.
[49:52] He's the same yesterday and today and
[49:54] forever. He still heals the sick. He is
[49:56] still God. And come out of that
[49:58] denominational way of thinking that
[50:01] you're better than someone else. Now,
[50:04] here's the quote that's been going
[50:06] around the world over the past few
[50:08] days. Thank you. Now, when these stones
[50:12] come together, they were cut out all
[50:15] over the world in different places. The
[50:18] wood hauled down from their tall cedars
[50:22] of Lebanon was cut and brought to Japa
[50:24] by ox cart and on in by by so forth by
[50:27] raft till they came to make the temple.
[50:31] But when they came together, I want you
[50:34] to notice the stones were cut this way,
[50:38] another stone cut another way. Perhaps
[50:41] the masons were cutting them. They might
[50:43] have argued and fussed and everything
[50:46] else. So he's trying to to make the
[50:48] point that all of these stones, these
[50:51] stonemasons, they were following the
[50:53] blueprint and they were shaping the
[50:55] stone that they were in charge of of um
[51:00] cutting and they were looking over at
[51:02] the other stones by these other masons
[51:04] and they were looking at their
[51:05] blueprints and their stones and they
[51:07] were saying, "No, you're doing it
[51:09] wrong." and starting these
[51:12] arguments like a bunch of preachers does
[51:15] today. I'm the Methodist. I'm the church
[51:18] of God. Glory to God. I belong to the
[51:20] assemblies. I this. You keep fussing.
[51:22] But remember, it's God is the one that's
[51:26] doing the cutting.
[51:29] And when this cuts this way and one that
[51:31] way, they couldn't understand. But when
[51:34] they went to put it together, the whole
[51:36] thing was laying on the ground. and they
[51:37] put it block on block and they didn't
[51:39] have to cut anymore. He's saying that
[51:41] the blocks of the temple all looked
[51:43] different. Some were big, some were
[51:45] small, some some were different shapes,
[51:48] but they were all according to God's
[51:51] plan. For for those of you that claim to
[51:54] believe William Brandham, you've got to
[51:56] accept that part just as you accept the
[51:59] other parts. Methodists Assemblies of
[52:01] God, Church of God, today it's called
[52:03] Calvary Chapel. It's called Zion City.
[52:05] It's it's the Baptist church down the
[52:07] road. Building blocks in God's
[52:10] temple. I believe one of these glorious
[52:14] days when it's when this united
[52:16] confederation of churches goes together
[52:18] and the new pope is brought out of the
[52:20] United States and put over there
[52:22] according to prophecy. Then they'll form
[52:24] an image like unto the beast. And I tell
[52:26] you, the true church of God will be
[52:28] driven together. Will be drove together.
[52:30] the real true believer out of the
[52:32] Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian,
[52:34] Pentecostal, Nazarene, Pilgrim,
[52:36] Holiness, whatever they'll be
[52:40] will cemented by the love of God,
[52:44] that'll make the body of the Lord Jesus
[52:46] Christ, all the
[52:48] believers, an agnostic and shallow
[52:50] minded will be cast to one side and
[52:52] they'll go right on into the
[52:54] confederation of churches.
[52:56] I've heard so much about this prophecy
[52:58] over the fa past few days, but is any
[53:01] one actually listening to what it
[53:04] said? It was his ministry. Come out of
[53:06] the denominational way of thinking and
[53:08] come together in the love of God and
[53:11] stop looking at these barriers that are
[53:13] between us and then that will make the
[53:16] body of the Lord Jesus.
[53:20] If you would just uh just leave that
[53:23] quote up
[53:24] there. And the new pope is brought out
[53:26] of the United States and put over there
[53:28] according to
[53:29] prophecy. Pause for a
[53:31] minute. Is he referring to a prophecy in
[53:34] the
[53:35] Bible? Is he referring to something
[53:37] someone else
[53:39] prophesied? Because there's other
[53:41] prophecies about a pope coming out of
[53:42] the United
[53:43] States. Or is he referring to the words
[53:46] that he's saying at that moment? Is that
[53:48] the
[53:49] prophecy? We don't know. He doesn't say.
[53:53] I feel like the Ethiopian with Philillip
[53:56] when he's out there and he's reading the
[53:57] book of Isaiah and he's like, is he
[53:59] talking about himself or is he talking
[54:01] about someone
[54:03] else? And with this, it really it
[54:07] doesn't matter in this
[54:09] case. Everybody's saying everybody, you
[54:12] know, starts running around in circles
[54:13] and saying the sky is falling. But
[54:16] listen to the statement. He's saying
[54:17] that the people that the pope is brought
[54:20] out of the United States and put there
[54:22] according to prophecy. It doesn't matter
[54:24] who gave the prophecy if it's prophecy.
[54:27] It comes from God and it goes through
[54:30] whoever it might be. But it still, you
[54:32] have to consider the source which is
[54:35] God. And this whole prophecy, this whole
[54:38] thing is about unity among Christians.
[54:41] It's not about a single denomination or
[54:43] a group.
[54:45] The real true believers out of the
[54:47] Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian,
[54:48] Pentecostal, Nazarene, pil pilgrim,
[54:50] holiness, whatever they'll be, will go
[54:53] together and be cemented by the love of
[54:55] God. And that'll make the body of Jesus
[54:56] Christ all the believers.
[54:59] So the pope coming out of the United
[55:00] States to fulfill what was said, it
[55:03] seems like it, but don't just jump.
[55:07] Pray.
[55:08] Meditate on God. Meditate on his word.
[55:12] I believe this new pope coming from the
[55:14] United States is significant. Doesn't
[55:16] mean that a federation of churches is
[55:18] going to take over the United States and
[55:19] the Catholic Church is going to ba bail
[55:21] out the national debt and we're going to
[55:23] be able to get gather and we're not
[55:24] going to be able to gather together and
[55:25] worship like this anymore
[55:29] maybe. Or do you think maybe people are
[55:31] taking a prophecy to a place where God
[55:34] never intended it to be?
[55:36] I wonder why God has so much trouble
[55:39] speaking to us.
[55:41] will take something that he said and
[55:45] then we'll put our own interpretation to
[55:46] it, our own desires to it and then make
[55:49] it some big thing and God will say, "I
[55:52] didn't say that. You said that. You
[55:54] brought that to a place that I didn't
[55:56] want it to
[55:57] go." No wonder why it's so hard to hear
[56:02] the voice of God.
[56:05] I don't know what the the the prophecy I
[56:08] I I don't know what's fulfilled and
[56:10] what's not. But one thing I do know is
[56:11] it's about love and unity. That is the
[56:14] main the main
[56:16] theme. But for those min ministers who
[56:18] are jumping to conclusions, I think the
[56:20] people should take note of what they
[56:22] say. And if it doesn't come to pass,
[56:26] then don't believe them
[56:28] anymore. If it does come to pass, then
[56:31] then believe them. But look back at
[56:34] other predictions that they made about
[56:35] Israel or the last pope or or or other
[56:38] world events or about CO 19 and hold
[56:40] them to task on those predictions,
[56:43] too. Don't just go out and proclaim
[56:47] proclaim them to be false prophets.
[56:49] That's not right. Don't do
[56:51] that. But don't believe what they say
[56:54] anymore.
[56:56] In my opinion, the most famous famous
[56:59] prophecy about the end time is Jesus's
[57:01] sermon in Matthew 24. Matthew 24:4 says
[57:05] this. And Jesus answered and said unto
[57:08] them, "Take heed that no man deceive
[57:10] you." So don't get mad at me if I don't
[57:14] jump on board with all these guys and
[57:16] how they're interpreting this. They've
[57:18] made predictions and interpreted modern
[57:20] events before and they've been wrong.
[57:23] And it's not me saying to take heed and
[57:26] to be
[57:27] careful. Jesus is saying
[57:30] that. For many shall come in my name,
[57:32] saying, "I am Christ," and shall deceive
[57:37] many. And ye shall hear of wars and
[57:40] rumors of wars. See that you be not
[57:42] troubled, for all these things must come
[57:44] to pass, but the end is not yet. For
[57:46] nation shall rise against nation, and
[57:47] kingdom against kingdom, and there shall
[57:49] be famines and pestilence, and
[57:50] earthquakes, and diverse places. All
[57:52] these are the beginning of s sorrows.
[57:54] Then shall they deliver you up to be
[57:56] afflicted and shall kill you and you
[57:58] shall be hated of all nations for my
[58:00] name's sake. Then shall many be offended
[58:02] and shall betray one another and shall
[58:05] hate one another.
[58:08] That's the one focus on
[58:10] that. How much hatred is there between
[58:12] so-called Christian churches?
[58:16] The way the text is, it looks like the
[58:18] same people hating each other are the
[58:20] same ones that are coming in the name of
[58:22] Jesus Christ.
[58:25] And many false prophets shall rise and
[58:27] deceive many. Many false prophets shall
[58:30] arrive and and arise and deceive many.
[58:33] 1977, Y2K, 2012, Mayan calendar, blood
[58:37] moons, red heers, and many others. And
[58:40] every time deception comes, it is
[58:42] pointing people to an exclusive
[58:45] revelation and not to just Christ.
[58:52] And because iniquity shall abound
[58:53] abound, the love of many shall wax cold.
[58:56] New King James version says, "And
[58:59] because law lawlessness will abound, the
[59:01] love of many will grow cold."
[59:04] Brother said the prophecy that the body
[59:07] the prophecy he said in the prophecy
[59:10] that the body of Christ is cemented by
[59:12] the love of
[59:14] God. That is the ultimate outcome of
[59:18] this prophecy or it should be that's
[59:19] where our focus should be. But he that
[59:21] shall endure to the end shall be saved.
[59:24] So just be steady in your beliefs in
[59:26] Christ. Be steady in your relationship
[59:29] with Christ. Love the Lord with all your
[59:31] heart and put into practice the things
[59:33] that he taught. Watch for signs because
[59:36] because they mean something, but
[59:37] ultimately endure in your walk with
[59:42] Christ. And this gospel of the kingdom
[59:44] shall be preached in all the world for a
[59:46] witness unto all nations and then shall
[59:48] the end
[59:50] come. Most important thing is that the
[59:52] gospel of Jesus Christ is preached in
[59:54] introducing the world to Jesus Christ.
[59:56] Then the end will come.
[59:59] We're to make disciples. We're to
[1:00:00] baptize them. We're to teach them to
[1:00:02] observe everything Christ taught. And
[1:00:04] that that will bring the second coming
[1:00:06] of Christ.
[1:00:07] Friends, my point in saying all this is
[1:00:11] that I believe the pope coming out of
[1:00:12] the United States has the utmost
[1:00:14] significance. But I also see the false
[1:00:18] prophets are saying fantastic
[1:00:20] things. and all the wars and all the
[1:00:23] world and all the lack of love and all
[1:00:26] the lack of burden to see everyone saved
[1:00:28] by the blood of Jesus Christ. All those
[1:00:30] things are also signs of the end. So
[1:00:33] when we see these signs, we are taught
[1:00:35] to look up. What should we look up to?
[1:00:37] What's up there? God's up there
[1:00:42] because our redemption is drawing nigh
[1:00:43] and he is our redeemer.
[1:00:46] I'll close this part with saying with
[1:00:48] Hebrews 10 says this. Hebrews 10 verse
[1:00:53] 23 and this is a typical statement in
[1:00:55] the New Testament. This isn't the only
[1:00:57] time it says this. Let us hold fast to
[1:01:00] the prof to the profession of our fa
[1:01:02] faith without wavering for he is
[1:01:04] faithful that promised and let us
[1:01:06] consider consider one another to provoke
[1:01:08] unto love and to good
[1:01:10] works, not forsaking the assembling of
[1:01:13] ourselves together as the manner of some
[1:01:15] is, but exhorting one another. and so
[1:01:18] much the more as you see the day
[1:01:21] approaching. That day is referring to
[1:01:25] the day that Christ
[1:01:27] returns. And if you believe that we're
[1:01:29] on the we're in the end times, then
[1:01:31] assemble yourselves with fellow
[1:01:33] Christians. Go to church, go to prayer
[1:01:35] meetings, go to Bible studies, be
[1:01:37] together, stir up one another in love
[1:01:40] and in good
[1:01:41] works as you see that day approaching.
[1:01:45] So if you believed this to be a prophecy
[1:01:47] about the pope, then understand that the
[1:01:50] prophecy is about love and unity and not
[1:01:54] about division and separation. Are we
[1:01:57] together? Amen.
[1:01:59] It's God's whole plan is about love. And
[1:02:02] these prophecies and scriptures, they
[1:02:06] won't do you any good unless you see
[1:02:08] them for what they
[1:02:11] are.
[1:02:13] My I'm I'm out of time, so I'm going to
[1:02:16] uh I'm going to stop right there. But
[1:02:20] the prophecy about the Pope, in my
[1:02:22] opinion, is a call to love and unity
[1:02:26] among Christians and not a call to say,
[1:02:30] "See, we told you so."
[1:02:33] No, it's a call for humility. And it's a
[1:02:36] call to love one another. Thank you,
[1:02:38] Lord.
[1:02:41] Now, Mother's Day, praise God. And and
[1:02:45] you know, when we talk about
[1:02:47] love, I can't I can't think of a more
[1:02:50] outwardly visible love than a love that
[1:02:54] a mother has for her
[1:02:57] child. I can't. And today's Mother's
[1:03:00] Day, and we want to honor our mothers in
[1:03:02] our congregation. John Wesley said, "I
[1:03:04] learned more about Christianity from my
[1:03:07] mother than from all the theologians in
[1:03:09] England." Abraham Lincoln said, "All
[1:03:12] that I am or hope to be, I owe to my
[1:03:14] angel
[1:03:17] mother." George Washington said, "My
[1:03:19] mother was the most beautiful woman I
[1:03:21] ever saw. All I am, I owe to my mother.
[1:03:24] I attribute all my success in life to
[1:03:27] the moral, intellectual, and physical
[1:03:29] education I received from her."
[1:03:31] Brother Ram said, "When motherhood is
[1:03:34] broken, the backbone of this country is
[1:03:37] broken." So all the time that you spend
[1:03:40] with your
[1:03:41] kids, all the time that that you spend
[1:03:44] holding the newborn baby, all the time
[1:03:47] that you spend teaching them and
[1:03:50] standing up for them, mothers, your
[1:03:52] efforts have not been in vain. It's the
[1:03:56] best thing that you can do. It'll stay
[1:03:58] with those kids.
[1:04:01] forever. That love of a
[1:04:03] mother, the most important thing that we
[1:04:07] can give our child that will carry them
[1:04:09] through is love and they'll never
[1:04:13] forget. One of those ways, Stephanie,
[1:04:17] when uh when the kids were little, she
[1:04:19] homeschooled the kids. And uh one of
[1:04:22] the goals that she had in homeschooling
[1:04:26] the kids is she wanted to read out loud
[1:04:30] every word in the Bible to her children
[1:04:34] from
[1:04:35] Genesis chapter 1 to Revelation chapter
[1:04:38] 22. And she accomplished it. She read
[1:04:42] every every word in the Bible to the
[1:04:44] kids and she taught them that you got to
[1:04:46] you got to learn certain chapters in the
[1:04:49] Bible. Honey, how many time how many
[1:04:51] chapters did they learn?
[1:04:55] Yeah. It's like like you didn't
[1:04:57] know.
[1:04:59] Seven. So, Daniel, I'm put you on the
[1:05:03] spot. Come on. Come up here. One of one
[1:05:08] of need a microphone.
[1:05:17] One of those chapters that Stephanie
[1:05:18] taught to kids when they were little.
[1:05:22] Buddy, stand up here in front because I
[1:05:24] don't want you to be able to see that
[1:05:25] monitor. No. Up
[1:05:30] there. One. One of the chapters that
[1:05:34] they learned when they were
[1:05:36] kids was 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:05:40] 13, the love chapter.
[1:05:44] Daniel, it's been a long time, buddy.
[1:05:47] probably 15 years, 10 years. All right,
[1:05:51] brother Jordan, if you could put it up
[1:05:53] on the screen. Daniel, if you peek,
[1:05:54] you're
[1:05:57] busted. God bless you guys. And 1
[1:05:59] Corinthians 13 was actually the first
[1:06:02] scripture uh chapter that my mom taught
[1:06:04] us. And uh it's always been on my heart.
[1:06:07] Like every time I think of the Bible,
[1:06:09] she taught us 1 Corinthians 13, Romans
[1:06:11] 8. And just growing up, those have
[1:06:13] always been the scriptures that would
[1:06:15] help me through the hard times because
[1:06:17] they were literally engraved on my
[1:06:18] brain. And so I just I'm eternally
[1:06:21] grateful to my beautiful mom and I I
[1:06:23] just love her so much.
[1:06:29] Me too. So now let's do it. Okay. So
[1:06:34] though I speak with tongues of men and
[1:06:36] angels and have not charity, I have
[1:06:38] become a sounding brass or a tinkling
[1:06:40] symbol. And though I have the gift of
[1:06:41] prophecy and understand all mysteries
[1:06:43] and have all knowledge, and though I
[1:06:45] have all faith so that I could remove
[1:06:47] mountains and have not charity, I am
[1:06:50] nothing. And though I bestow all my
[1:06:51] goods to feed the poor, and give my body
[1:06:53] to be burned, and have not charity, it
[1:06:56] profitth me nothing. Charity suffereth
[1:06:58] long and is kind. Charity envieth not.
[1:07:01] Charity vaunteth not itself, is not
[1:07:03] puffed up, doth not behave itself
[1:07:05] unseemingly, seeketh not our own, is not
[1:07:08] easily provoked, thinkketh no evil,
[1:07:11] rejoices not in iniquity, but rejoices
[1:07:13] in the truth, beareth all things,
[1:07:16] believeth all things, hopeeth all
[1:07:18] things, endureth all things. Charity
[1:07:20] never
[1:07:22] faileth. Charity Charity never failth.
[1:07:25] And whether there be prophecies, they
[1:07:27] shall fail. Whether there be tongues,
[1:07:29] they shall cease. Whether there be
[1:07:30] knowledge, it shall vanish away. For For
[1:07:34] I know, for we know in part, and we
[1:07:37] prophesy in part. For when that which is
[1:07:39] perfect is come, that which is in part
[1:07:41] shall be done away. When I was a child,
[1:07:43] I spake as a child. I understood as a
[1:07:45] child, I thought as a child. But when I
[1:07:47] became a man, I put away my childish
[1:07:49] things. For now, we see through a glass
[1:07:52] darkly. But then face to face. Then
[1:07:54] shall But then face to face now I shall
[1:07:57] know. And then shall I know, even also
[1:08:00] as I am known. And now abideth faith,
[1:08:03] hope, and charity, these three. But the
[1:08:05] greatest of these is charity.
[1:08:14] Yes. Oh my my wife back
[1:08:17] there, she was mouthing every word and
[1:08:20] going, "Come on. Come
[1:08:24] on. Praise God.
[1:08:26] It never leaves them. The scriptures
[1:08:30] that you teach them, they never leave.
[1:08:32] But most of all, the love that you
[1:08:35] mothers show for your children, that is
[1:08:37] the most important thing. And that never
[1:08:40] leaves.
[1:08:42] They could be in their
[1:08:45] 50s and they'll always come back to that
[1:08:48] love that was showed to them at home. I
[1:08:51] want to give out some
[1:08:53] awards and then I'll uh I'll read a few
[1:08:55] scriptures on love and the love of a
[1:08:59] mother.
[1:09:00] First, we will give an award. Now, these
[1:09:04] plants we got here,
[1:09:09] um they're irises and they're alive, so
[1:09:13] don't let them die, Mom.
[1:09:17] The
[1:09:19] first and for seniority we want to give
[1:09:23] our gift to the oldest mother. Yes, you
[1:09:27] have to state your age. So you can

[1:09:32] yourself or you know when you get over
[1:09:35] 70 you're proud of your
[1:09:38] years. How many mothers do we have over
[1:09:40] 70 years old here? Raise your hand.

[1:10:01] can. I'm just kidding. How many mothers
[1:10:04] over 80? We have one,
[1:10:07] two, three, four,
[1:10:13] five over

[1:10:44] birth. How many
[1:10:47] mothers? 90 or
[1:10:51] more. Do I have to put it in
[1:10:55] reverse? My grandma Wheeler's watching
[1:10:57] right now. She She's 98. God bless you,
[1:11:01] Grandma. I love you.
[1:11:06] Let's go back to to uh to 88. How many
[1:11:11] how many mothers here are 88 years old
[1:11:12] or older? One,
[1:11:16] two. Do we have an

[1:16:42] more. You can go ahead and and deliver
[1:16:44] that one right over there. Um Lani, what
[1:16:48] what color? White or white or purple?
[1:16:56] Okay. Praise the
[1:16:58] Lord. I have one more.
[1:17:06] all the way back to Sister
[1:17:08] L. One more
[1:17:12] gift and this one is because of someone
[1:17:15] that's done such a wonderful job this
[1:17:18] year with her foster kids and
[1:17:22] adopting all these babies and bringing
[1:17:26] them to church and just jumping right in
[1:17:29] to parenthood.
[1:17:31] Great job. Where is sister Angela? Is
[1:17:33] she
[1:17:35] around? Angela
[1:17:45] Bagot, God bless you. There she is back
[1:17:48] there. You can look at
[1:17:49] her. All right. Praise the Lord for the
[1:17:59] mothers. I've counseledled parents
[1:18:02] before and and many times the parents
[1:18:05] will
[1:18:07] mothers call me or or they they have a
[1:18:12] burden for their children as all mothers
[1:18:14] do and and they just a mother feels
[1:18:20] just really it's just a portion of what
[1:18:23] God feels for all of us. The love of God
[1:18:26] far is is far beyond that of a mother.
[1:18:31] But the strongest love that I can see
[1:18:33] that that I have seen is that love that
[1:18:35] a mother has for her child. And how many
[1:18:38] times have I had mothers come to me and
[1:18:40] say, "My my son or my daughter is doing
[1:18:42] this or doing that and and they're
[1:18:44] sinning." And my advice is always,
[1:18:46] "Sister, place it into the hands of God
[1:18:50] because his hands are much better than
[1:18:52] yours. There's no greater hands." I
[1:18:55] believe to take care of a child than a
[1:18:56] mother. But God's hands are better.
[1:18:58] Amen. And we trust in the Lord and and
[1:19:01] we give our children over to the Lord.
[1:19:03] When when God made Adam and Eve, he
[1:19:08] separated the two sexes. To the man, he
[1:19:11] gave the leadership role. And motherly
[1:19:14] love was placed in the woman. The
[1:19:17] mothers do everything they can for their
[1:19:19] children. And if they will just place
[1:19:24] them into the hands of God with this
[1:19:25] love, then you can rest assured that
[1:19:28] everything is going to be okay. I wanted
[1:19:30] to Daniel read 1 Corinthians chapter 13.
[1:19:32] Let's rewind to 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:19:37] 12 verse number 24. I'm going to read
[1:19:40] the New King James Version because it
[1:19:43] says love instead of charity.
[1:19:47] But our presentable parts have no need.
[1:19:50] But God composed the body, having given
[1:19:53] greater honor to the to that part which
[1:19:56] lacks it, that there should be no
[1:19:58] schism, no division in the body, but
[1:20:01] that the members should have the same
[1:20:03] care one for another. And if one member
[1:20:06] suffers, all the members suffer with it.
[1:20:08] Or if one member is honored, all the
[1:20:11] members rejoice with it. Think about
[1:20:14] that example of a mother right here.
[1:20:16] When Daniel was able to quote this
[1:20:19] scripture up here, the person that was
[1:20:21] the most nervous in this whole room was
[1:20:23] not
[1:20:25] Daniel. It was his mom.
[1:20:28] And she wanted Daniel to succeed more
[1:20:31] than Daniel wanted to succeed. And when
[1:20:35] her children when a mother's children
[1:20:37] when they suffer, the mother suffers
[1:20:40] even more than the child does.
[1:20:43] And the mothers would rather take that
[1:20:45] suffering upon
[1:20:47] themselves. And the apostle Paul here is
[1:20:49] saying that that's how we should be with
[1:20:51] each
[1:20:52] other. What a great example a mother is.
[1:20:55] If one member suffers, if one member of
[1:20:58] us suffers, then we should
[1:21:00] all suffer with it. And then I said the
[1:21:05] happiest person when Daniel
[1:21:08] finished was
[1:21:10] Stephanie because he did
[1:21:13] it happier than her son. And that's how
[1:21:16] we should be with each other. If one
[1:21:18] member of us is is honored or if one
[1:21:21] thing if something good happens to one
[1:21:23] of us, we should rejoice as a
[1:21:26] congregation. We should rejoice as the
[1:21:28] body of Christ even more than that
[1:21:31] person that was honored.
[1:21:33] When one member is honored, all the
[1:21:35] members should
[1:21:37] rejoice. That example of a mother is
[1:21:39] exactly how the body of Christ should
[1:21:42] operate. Now listen to what he says. Now
[1:21:45] you are the body of Christ and members
[1:21:47] individually. And God has appointed
[1:21:49] these in the church. First apostles,
[1:21:51] second prophets, third
[1:21:53] teachers. After that, miracles, then
[1:21:55] gifts of healing, helps,
[1:21:56] administrations, varieties of tongues.
[1:21:59] Are all apostles?
[1:22:01] Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are
[1:22:03] all workers of miracles? Do all have
[1:22:05] gifts of healing? Do all speak with
[1:22:07] tongues? Do all interpret but earnestly
[1:22:10] desire the best
[1:22:11] gifts? Now watch
[1:22:14] this. And yet I show you a more
[1:22:18] excellent
[1:22:20] way. NIV says, "And yet I will show you
[1:22:24] the most excellent way."
[1:22:26] NLT says, "But now let me show you a way
[1:22:29] of life that is best of all.
[1:22:33] Though I speak with tongue of men and
[1:22:35] angels and have not love, I become a
[1:22:38] sounding brass or a tinkling symbol. And
[1:22:40] though I have gift of prophecy and
[1:22:42] understand all the mysteries and all the
[1:22:44] knowledge and and through and though I
[1:22:46] have all faith so that I could remove
[1:22:49] mountains but have not love, I am
[1:22:51] nothing." Amen.
[1:22:53] And though I bestow all my gifts to feed
[1:22:55] the poor, and though I give my body to
[1:22:57] be d burned, but have not love, it
[1:23:00] profits me nothing. All the prophecies,
[1:23:04] all the faith, understand all the
[1:23:06] mysteries, have all the knowledge, I am
[1:23:09] nothing without love.
[1:23:12] prophecy that I read earlier. It says
[1:23:16] this, "And cemented by the love of God
[1:23:20] that'll make the body of the Lord Jesus
[1:23:23] that will make the body of the Lord
[1:23:25] Jesus all the
[1:23:26] believers." cemented by the love of
[1:23:30] God. 1 John chapter 4 verse 7. Beloved,
[1:23:36] let us love one another. For love is of
[1:23:38] God. And everyone that loveth is born of
[1:23:41] God and knoweth God. He that loveth not
[1:23:45] knoweth not God, for God is love. It's
[1:23:48] one of my favorite statements in the
[1:23:50] whole Bible. God is
[1:23:53] love. In this was manifested the love of
[1:23:56] God toward us because that God sent his
[1:23:58] only begotten son into the world that we
[1:24:00] might live through him. The same apostle
[1:24:03] that wrote
[1:24:05] this, wrote the same the most famous
[1:24:09] scripture in the entire Bible, he
[1:24:11] recorded in John 3:16, the one Sister
[1:24:14] Hope mentioned the other day when we
[1:24:15] were sharing our favorite scriptures.
[1:24:17] For for God so loved the world that he
[1:24:19] gave his only begotten son that who
[1:24:21] believes in him should not perish but
[1:24:23] have everlasting
[1:24:24] life. This that's writing these things
[1:24:27] is the beloved disciple. the disciple
[1:24:29] that was one of the closest to Jesus
[1:24:31] Christ, if not the closest. And the
[1:24:33] theme of his epistles is
[1:24:37] love. The greatest people that I've ever
[1:24:39] known in my life, and my mom included,
[1:24:43] are the people that loved more than
[1:24:45] anyone
[1:24:47] else. I my when I was a kid, my
[1:24:51] mom, I think I've told this story before
[1:24:53] to some of you, my I was in like eighth
[1:24:57] grade and and
[1:24:59] you know, the I was kind of nerdy and
[1:25:03] and I mean, obviously, I didn't stay
[1:25:05] that
[1:25:06] way, but I uh you know, I wanted the
[1:25:11] girls to like me and I just, you know, I
[1:25:15] wasn't wasn't all that.
[1:25:18] And my mom had this red notebook and my
[1:25:21] mom wrote in her handwriting in
[1:25:25] pen, "I love you." And she put a heart
[1:25:29] around it. And I didn't know I get to I
[1:25:33] get to school and I have it sitting on
[1:25:35] my desk and my friend Vinnie looks at my
[1:25:38] um folder and he says, "Hey, that's not
[1:25:42] your handwriting." I was like, "Yeah,
[1:25:44] it's not.
[1:25:50] Somebody must love
[1:25:53] me. I didn't tell him that it was my
[1:25:57] mom. Going to let him know that I had a
[1:26:00] girlfriend maybe that nobody knew
[1:26:04] about. No man has seen God at any
[1:26:07] time. If we love one another, God
[1:26:10] dwelleth in us and his love is perfected
[1:26:13] in us.
[1:26:15] Romans chapter 5 verse 6 says this, "For
[1:26:19] when we were yet without
[1:26:21] strength, in due time Christ died for
[1:26:24] the
[1:26:25] ungodly. For scarcely for a righteous
[1:26:28] man will one die. Yet per venture for a
[1:26:31] good man some would even dare to die.
[1:26:34] But God commended his love toward us
[1:26:38] that while we were yet sinners, Christ
[1:26:42] died for
[1:26:44] us. I can't help but think of a
[1:26:47] mother and the love of a mother there.
[1:26:50] In all of my sinful days when I was a
[1:26:53] teenager and and everything that I did,
[1:26:55] my mom didn't love me any less during
[1:26:58] those times than she did during the
[1:27:01] times that I was serving the Lord. And
[1:27:04] that's how our Lord Jesus Christ is.
[1:27:06] Though you were yet
[1:27:08] sinners, he died for
[1:27:12] you. And Jesus loved us when we were yet
[1:27:16] sinners. If you're not serving the Lord,
[1:27:19] doesn't mean he loves you any less.
[1:27:22] He thinks about us. He wants us to come
[1:27:26] to him.
[1:27:28] much more then being now justified by
[1:27:31] his blood, we shall be saved from wrath
[1:27:34] through him. Musicians can come and I'll
[1:27:39] close. Galatians 5:13 says this, "For
[1:27:43] brethren, ye have been called unto
[1:27:46] liberty. Only use not liberty for an
[1:27:48] occasion to the flesh, but by love serve
[1:27:52] one
[1:27:54] another. For all that the law is
[1:27:56] fulfilled. For all the law is fulfilled
[1:27:59] in one word, even this, thou shalt love
[1:28:02] thy neighbor as
[1:28:05] thyself. Philippians chapter 1:9 says
[1:28:08] this. And this I pray that your love may
[1:28:11] abound yet more and more in knowledge
[1:28:13] and in all
[1:28:15] judgment, that you may approve things
[1:28:17] that are
[1:28:18] excellent, that you may be sincere and
[1:28:21] without offense till the day of Christ,
[1:28:23] being filled with the fruits of
[1:28:25] righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ
[1:28:28] unto the glory and the praise of God.
[1:28:33] He says, "I pray that your love may
[1:28:35] abound yet more and more in knowledge
[1:28:38] and in
[1:28:40] judgment." And this last scripture, 1
[1:28:43] Peter chapter
[1:28:45] 4:7, "But the end of all things is at
[1:28:49] hand. Be therefore sober and watch under
[1:28:52] prayer." It's not wrong, friends, to
[1:28:54] preach the end times. Peter preached the
[1:28:57] end times 2,000 years ago.
[1:28:59] It's not wrong to warn of coming
[1:29:02] judgment. It's not wrong to say that the
[1:29:06] end of all things is at hand, especially
[1:29:08] now that we see the signs of the
[1:29:10] end. Peter wrote these
[1:29:13] words 2,000 years ago after Jesus had
[1:29:17] gone up as ascended
[1:29:19] up. But the end of all things is at
[1:29:22] hand. Be therefore sober and watch under
[1:29:25] prayer.
[1:29:28] New King James says, "Therefore, be
[1:29:29] serious and watchful in your prayers.
[1:29:31] And above all things, have fervent
[1:29:34] charity. Have fervent
[1:29:36] love above all
[1:29:38] things. Above all the understanding that
[1:29:41] you may have, above all the study that
[1:29:42] you may have, above all, above all the
[1:29:45] sacrifices that you may have, above all
[1:29:49] things, have fervent love one for
[1:29:53] another, for love will cover a multitude
[1:29:56] of sins.
[1:29:59] Amen. Colossians chapter
[1:30:01] 3, 30 seconds. Colossians chapter
[1:30:06] 3, verse
[1:30:08] 14. But above all these things, put on
[1:30:13] love, which is the bond of
[1:30:17] perfection. before Jesus
[1:30:20] died, he got his disciples
[1:30:24] together and he preached to them his
[1:30:27] last
[1:30:28] message. And then
[1:30:31] Jesus went to
[1:30:33] prayer and he prayed and he said,
[1:30:36] "Lord, I pray that they would be
[1:30:39] one as you and I are one." He wasn't
[1:30:43] just talking about Tucson Tabernacle. He
[1:30:45] wasn't just talking about this church or
[1:30:47] that church. He wanted all of his people
[1:30:50] to be together in love. Just as a mom
[1:30:56] wants all of her children to be together
[1:30:58] in
[1:30:59] love. He had
[1:31:01] that attribute about
[1:31:04] him and he commanded us love one
[1:31:08] another. He even said something on the
[1:31:11] order of, "And by this, I'll know
[1:31:15] you. When I return, by your
[1:31:19] love one for
[1:31:21] another." How much good could a church
[1:31:23] do? All of our
[1:31:25] doctrines and everything everything that
[1:31:28] we preach and all all of the explanation
[1:31:30] that we have of the Bible and all of
[1:31:32] these these revelations and all these
[1:31:34] deep doctrine, how much more could a
[1:31:36] church do for the community? How much
[1:31:38] more could a church do for a visitor?
[1:31:40] How much more could a church do if they
[1:31:42] truly showed love?
[1:31:47] It's the greatest of all. And let me
[1:31:49] quote the Apostle John again, the
[1:31:51] beloved disciple. He said, "God is
[1:31:56] love for the mothers. The love that you
[1:31:59] have is so beautiful for your children
[1:32:03] and for us, all of us. And all of us
[1:32:06] have a
[1:32:09] mom. Show your mother respect. Love her
[1:32:13] if she's still here. Mine's
[1:32:16] gone. I I don't like to think about it,
[1:32:19] but I I would like to talk to her
[1:32:23] again. So, if you have a mother
[1:32:26] here, talk to her. Sit down. Just you
[1:32:29] and her. Talk to her about the things of
[1:32:31] the Lord. Tell her how much you love
[1:32:33] her.
[1:32:37] And I promise you'll never regret it.
[1:32:39] The love of a mother is the most
[1:32:41] beautiful thing in the world. But the
[1:32:43] love of Jesus Christ, it's far beyond
[1:32:46] anything we could ever imagine.
[1:32:48] [Music]
[1:32:55] The love of
[1:33:01] God is
[1:33:03] greater
[1:33:07] far than tongue or
[1:33:13] pen can ever tell.
[1:33:17] [Music]
[1:33:20] It
[1:33:21] goes
[1:33:25] beyond the
[1:33:27] high
[1:33:31] star and reaches
[1:33:36] to the lowest hand.
[1:33:43] The guilty
[1:33:46] [Music]
[1:33:48] pair bound down with
[1:33:54] care. God gave his
[1:34:00] son
[1:34:02] to him.
[1:34:07] [Music]
[1:34:08] [Applause]
[1:34:08] [Music]
[1:34:12] He
[1:34:15] [Music]

[1:34:30] Oh love of
[1:34:31] [Music]
[1:34:34] God, how rich is
[1:34:40] you. I'll measure
[1:34:47] them and strong.

[1:38:53] s. Let's all stand.
[1:38:56] Brother Jordan, if you could
[1:38:59] put that last verse up there
[1:39:04] that to write the love of
[1:39:07] [Music]
[1:39:13] God. It was
[1:39:16] written. No one knows who wrote it.
[1:39:20] Inscribed on the wall of an insane
[1:39:23] institution way back when. You have to
[1:39:27] wonder when this man wrote that on the
[1:39:31] wall. Could we with ink the ocean fill
[1:39:35] and were the skies of parchment made?
[1:39:37] Where every stock on earth aquill and
[1:39:39] every man ascribed by trade to write the
[1:39:42] love of God above would drain the ocean
[1:39:45] dry. Nor could the scroll contain the
[1:39:47] whole though stretched from sky to sky.
[1:39:52] Anonymous author written on the wall of
[1:39:55] an insane
[1:39:56] institution. A man maybe in the lowest
[1:39:58] of the low and still found the love of
[1:40:02] God in Jesus
[1:40:05] Christ. For the mothers, as you
[1:40:08] leave, we've got a small gift from the
[1:40:12] church for

[1:40:16] give you a good day today. brother safe

[1:40:21] going back home today? Welcome. We thank
[1:40:24] you again for coming and may the Lord

[1:41:24] would honor those mothers who may have a
[1:41:26] weward son or
[1:41:28] daughter. We pray, Lord, that that
[1:41:33] love and the prayers that go with it,
[1:41:36] Father, would come before you and that
[1:41:38] you would save, turn lives around,
[1:41:41] Father.
[1:41:44] And I give you a sincere thanks for a
[1:41:46] mother that taught me right, took care
[1:41:48] of me, as I'm sure that many, many
[1:41:52] people here in this congregation are
[1:41:53] doing the same. Thank you, Lord, for
[1:41:56] mothers that showed us
[1:41:59] love. They represented Jesus Christ to
[1:42:02] us, the first
[1:42:04] ones. We thank you for
[1:42:06] that. May your hand be upon all the
[1:42:09] mothers today.
[1:42:11] Father, we thank you once again for
[1:42:16] Christ our savior in Jesus
[1:42:20] name.
[1:42:23] Amen. Again, as you

[1:42:31] to the mothers. God bless you. You you
