TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Good morning and God bless each one of you this morning as we gather together here to be with the family. We know that God is mindful of all of us. So if you'll stand with me, we'll bow our heads in prayer and you talk to the Lord, too. It's not just the minister behind the pulpit, but you have as much right to ask the Lord to be your strength and be your comfort. Lord Jesus, we we come this morning as family, as friends, as part of the family of God. And Lord, it's in times like this that we can draw strength from one another. We can encourage one another. We can be [music] that help in the time of trouble, Lord. So we ask for your direction, your leading, your comfort, Lord, in all that is said and done. Something that [music] would give us strength to continue on as the days go forward. Lord, we commit each one and each person, each heart here [music] and this time to you in Jesus Christ's name. The very first verse of Amazing Grace. Amazing grace, how sweet does that [music and singing] say a rich [music] like me? [music] I [singing] once was lost but now I'm found. I was [music] mine but now [music and singing] what? And the last verse [music] when we've been [singing] there 10,000 years bright shineing [singing and music] as the sun [music] with no less days to sing God's praise than when we first beun. Thank you. You may be seated. Thank you all for coming. Appreciate the family. Appreciate it. And now, pastor of Tucson Tab Tabernacle, Brother Daniel Evans. Thank you. Good morning to everyone. I know sometimes it's a many times it's a funeral that gathers people together. And I know that anytime that there's a group of people gathered together in the name of the Lord Jesus, then that is a group that is pleasing to the Lord. He told us that wherever two or three are gathered in my name, there I will be in the midst of them. And we gather here in the name of the Lord Jesus. So, he's here. He's with us. the um the passing of our dear brother is um it is a difficult thing and I know it's a difficult thing for everyone for the family for for friends especially for the wife for the children for the mother but we do have to rest in assurance that this is God's will and we may think that how could God Lord how could you be maybe in our grieving. How could you be so cruel that you would take a young man like this and then leave a mom and children here grieving? But we have have to trust that God knows the end of the game. He knows the end of the road. And we have to trust that this is all to accomplish a task that has to be accomplished that will be better for everyone in the end. And we look at the the passing of of this young man and we have to trust God. Lord, this is your will. This was the perfect time to take him and he's in a better place. We don't have to worry about that. If if he wouldn't have taken him, if it wasn't going to be for his salvation and it wasn't going to be for his own benefit, he wouldn't have taken him. We have to trust God that he was a child of God. And and anyone that knew Gilbert knows he was a he was a good husband. He was he was a good dad. He was a good son. He was very respectful. In the times that I met him, he was one of the most respectful young men and uh treated me very um very nicely and uh he loved his family of talking with brother Isaac there and he was always with his kids. He was he was good and this was God's time to take him to bring him up to glory. I didn't know the brother very well and I was a bit concerned that what can I say about his life? What can I say about him that would be adequate? And really there's nothing but the one who is adequate to say something about his life is his wife Stephanie. So Stephanie gave me something that she wanted to read, but she was worried that she wasn't going to be able to get through it. So I would like to read what his wife wrote about Gilbert. Gilbert had the biggest heart and felt everything so deeply. He would drop everything just to help those he loved. He was always the one to put others needs before his own. Perhaps life is harder on those with such with such sensitivity. The ones who remember every word spoken, every facial expression, analyze body language or patterns. He just was born with the memory of an elephant. He had the most radiant smile, but it never was faked. You could only pull one. You could only pull one out if he was genuinely happy and laughing. He also had the best sense of humor and could always make me laugh. We bonded over comedy shows and movies. Gilbert was so nurturing as well. If you were sick, he would get the Vix vapor rub and place it on on our feet and chest. He would make soup, get medicine, or whatever we needed, he would get. I'm glad my wife's not here right now. I don't think I want to be held to that standard. He would get everything that we needed. And with every family member that he that passed, he was there to comfort me. For every nightmare I had, he was there to hold me. For every fear I had about change, he would tell me, "Everything is going to be okay." And it is, Stephanie. Everything's going to be okay. Gilbert had the most raw and genuine personality. You could never be confused on how he was feeling because he was just so straightforward about things. He could befriend anyone, and I mean anyone. The man knew how to talk. And for that gift, he would he could communicate and come off personable and relatable to anyone he met. Over the years of his life, he has made many friends and never was he judgmental to any of their situations. Amen. He had a great amount of compassion and always wanted to help. Lastly, his love for me and his kids was boundless. I know life without him will never be the same. We were going we were together for 17 years which he would boastingly say is over half of his age. We had our own secret sign language to communicate with each other. Later, as time went by, Gilbert was able to read my body language and facial expression and know exactly how I was feeling or what I was about to say. We were like ying and yang, complete opposites, but we completed each other each each other. And with all the flaws we witnessed within each other, we chose to keep fighting and keep loving each other. Gilbert Valenuela, you were enough for me. You are my best friend, and I will forever and always love you. He could hold any instrument and just instinctively know how to play it. He could just hear each note and he had a natural god-given talent. He would serenade me often and create his own music. And he could cook. He loved to go into the kitchen and just experiment with everything, food and drinks and ice cream. He would pull random ingredients and make a delicious soup. He would mix sham shamoy shamoy water tag and I'm really glad my wife's not here because I don't especially don't want to be expected to cook and tuning lemon and who knows what else to make delicious drink. He would dip fruit popsicles in shamoy and sprinkle tajun on top. I can't pronounce it, but you know what it is. White boy up here trying to. He was able to go to San Diego twice, go to the lake with his friends, camped with his mom's side and my side and his friends. He loved the outdoors and animals. He always wanted to go to Alaska and own a place out there away from the busy world. But Stephanie wrote about her beloved partner Gilbert. And you can tell the love coming from what was written. I'd like to mention uh something very important with a funeral. In fact, I think it's the most important thing. We honor those that are gone on. And the cliche saying is that well, you'll see them again or they are in a better place. The reason that we can say that is because of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. And that's why we have a promise. If we don't know him, we don't have that promise. But if we do know him, then it is a promise that will hold stronger than anything else in the world. You can count on it. You can bring that to the bank. It will not fail. I want to talk about another young man in the Bible who also died as as young maybe the same age as Gilbert was. That man's name is Lazarus and he was a close friend of our Lord Jesus. Jesus was out with his disciples and they received word from Lazarus's family that hey, your friend is sick. would you come would you come to to the family and and and help him? And Jesus kind of ignored the invitation to come and and visit his friend. Well, his friend got lower and lower and then Jesus made this statement in the book of John chap 11. Jesus said this. He said, "This sickness," speaking of Lazarus, he says, "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the son of God may be glorified in that." So Jesus is saying that his friend's death is not going to result his friend's sickness is not going to result in death. It's going to be it's going to result in something greater. It's going to result in something to be celebrated and not mourn over. And while Lazarus was getting sicker and sicker, Lazarus eventually died. And Jesus is just a few hours few hours away. And the disciples and where they were, they didn't know that Lazarus had died. And Jesus is talking to his disciples and they they may have mentioned,"Well, what about Lazarus? You know, are we going to go see him?" And and Jesus tells his disciples, "Lazarus is sleeping." And they're like, "Oh, good. That's good. You know, he's getting some rest." And and and Jesus says, "No, you don't understand. Lazarus is dead." And then they get on their road and and they go to visit the family at the funeral like we are here now. Now read some of this in the Bible. It says this. These things he said Jesus is talking about Jesus. These things he said that and after he he said that to them he said our friend Lazarus sleeps but I go that I may wake him and his disciples said Lord if he sleeps it he will get well. However Jesus spoke of his death but they thought that he was speaking about taking rest and sleep. Then Jesus said unto them plainly Lazarus is dead and I'm glad for your sakes that I was not there. This is a key key verse. I'm glad that that I wasn't there so that you can believe. Nevertheless, let us go to him. So God is going to use the death of this young man to help others who believe in Jesus. To help others believe in Jesus because he says so that you may also believe. And I can say the same with Gilbert. I pray today that Gilbert may use this death so that others might believe in Jesus. So Jesus goes and and he meets Martha there. Martha comes out to greet him and and he consoles her and he and he and he says that your brother is going to rise again. And Martha says,"I know that he will rise again in the resurrection." And Jesus says to her, listen to this. Jesus says, 'I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me, though he may die, he shall live. And whosoever lives and believes and believes in me shall never die. Then he says this, and I asked the congregation. whosoever believes in me shall never go never die. Do you believe this? And I asked the congregation today, do you believe it? That he who believes in Jesus shall never die. Then Martha's sister Mary comes out to meet Jesus and she's really upset as you can imagine. Then when Mary came where Jesus was and saw him, she fell down at his feet saying, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died." So how could Jesus, if he is God, how could Jesus just allow this young man like this to pass away and leave his family? The question in Mary's mind was a question that all of us might wonder. Lord, how could how could you do this to me? How could you take this man who seemed to be wonderful and and and we've heard Stephanie's testimony of him. He was he was great. How could you take him and how could you leave me here? Well, Jesus has a purpose here with Lazarus with the passing of Lazarus. Remember in verse four that I said he said, "This sickness is not leading to death." But then he died. How can Jesus say that this situation of the death of this young man is is not it's not about death but really it is about life and somehow today we see this scenario of Lazarus and his death up until this point and all of us [snorts] should put ourselves in that situation this morning when you heard maybe that Gilbert was in was in trouble. Esther texted me um or I believe it was uh Elizabeth Garrett texted me and said, "Go to prayer because Gilbert um Gilbert's in a serious situation. He had a heart attack and then I talked to you a little while afterwards." Well, where were you when all this happened? Where did you where did you hear this? And then this turn of events starts and then we hear or maybe you were there. We hear that the young man had passed away. And then we go through the week as the as the disciples were in their journeys and and what they were doing. All of us, we go through this week and we're thinking about Gilbert and we're missing him and and maybe we're weeping and we're mourning and and this is all leading up to a point as with the disciples. They they went to the grave of Lazarus. This was all leading up to something very special. And for us, this past week has been leading up to something very special and leading up to this very day right here where we are individuals. All of you have a walk that you have walked this past week leading to this very point. And this point could be a moment not of mourning but it could be a point of great joy. Remember Jesus said this sickness is not un to death unto death but for the glory of God that the son of God might be glorified through this. It's the same with Gilbert. This sickness and this death what happened? It is not about death. It is about that we would be able to rejoice in something great that Jesus is doing. Therefore, when Jesus saw her weeping, speaking of Martha or Mary, and the Jews who came with her weeping, he groaned in the spirit and was troubled. Remember Jesus already said, he said earlier that Lazarus is just sleeping. And I didn't read this part. He said that I'm going to go wake him. And now even Jesus is mourning the loss of his friend. Even though he knows he's going to rise again, even though we know that Gilbert's going to rise again, we know that we're going to see him again, we still can mourn. Jesus Christ, God in flesh, mourned the loss of his his friend. So it's not bad that we're sad. It's not bad that that these emotions are coming out. That's fine. That's normal. Even God in flesh did it. And they said, 'Lord, and then uh Jesus, he groaned in his spirit and he was troubled and he said, 'Where have you laid him? And they said to him, Lord, come and see. And then Jesus wept. The Jews said, "Look, see how he loved him." And one of them said, "Could not this man who opened the eyes of the blind also have kept this man from dying?" They're looking at Jesus. It's like, "I've seen him raise the dead. I've seen him give eye give sight to the blind. Well, why didn't he heal our loved one? When I prayed for him, maybe Sister Esther, when you prayed for him or or sister Stephanie, when you prayed for him, why didn't he raise him up? And it's easy. That's an easy question to ask. And that's what was asked here. Then Jesus again groaning in himself came to the tomb. It was a cave and a stone lay against it. And Jesus said, "Take away the stone." Then Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said, 'Lord, by this time there's a stench, for he's been dead for 4 days. And Jesus said to her, "Did I not say to you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?" Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was laying. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, "Father, I thank you that you have heard me and I know that you always hear me, but because of the people who are standing by, I said this that they may believe that you sent me." So he's saying right here, this whole thing is because not of La because of Lazarus and not because of Gilbert. This whole thing is for all of us. Gilbert's in a better place. He's not worried about us right now. We're the one worried. But because of the people who are standing by, I said this that they may believe you sent me the father. Jesus speaking to the father saying, "Lord, this is this is about why I came to the earth." Now when he had said these things, he cried with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come forth." And he who had died came out bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, "Loose him and let him go." Imagine that God took the death of this young man and turned it into a testimony to lead souls to Christ. In Jesus's very words again, I'll read it again. Father, I thank you that you have heard me. And I know that you always hear me because of the people who are standing by. I said that they may believe that you sent me. The passing of Gilbert is so that we that there are people here in this congregation that they might believe that that God is real, that Jesus is real, and that this opportunity is for me to make a decision in my life that I will follow this man, Jesus Christ. Don't worry about the churches. Don't worry about all the all the negative that you might see in Christianity. Don't worry about that because there is a real Christianity. There is a real Jesus Christ that is alive and that wants us to come to him. And then with him comes promises. Yes, I'll see Gilbert again, but that's not the best promise. Yes, I will see my loved ones again that have passed passed me on, but that's not the best promise. Yes, my family, although we may be united now, we will be united for eternity. But that's not the best promise. The best promise is that we will be in the presence of our savior for eternity. And where he wherever he is, we're safe. And there is joy wherever he is. There's liberty wherever Jesus is. There's peace wherever Jesus is. And friends, as I close, please Think about what's happened over these past few days from the death of Gilbert to this point. And walk yourself through what has happened as the disciples did. They say, "Oh, we were here. We heard the news. Then we were over here. We heard the news again. And then we came back. And now we are at the funeral. And now God wants to do something that's greater than anything in the world, which is to give me eternal life, which is to bring life. He brought life to Lazarus when he came out of the tomb, but it wasn't as important as as what we are here today because you know what? Lazarus died again. He got old and he died. But he had a promise to live eternally. And we have that promise. So please friends, consider consider the importance of this funeral. Consider the importance of what's happened over the past few days and consider giving your heart, your life to Jesus Christ. It's not about, well, I got to give up this and I got to give up that and if I'm going to be a Christian, I got to stop doing this and stop doing that. Don't worry about those things. Set those things aside. All Jesus wants is for you to come to him and say, "Lord, I come to you and I am full of flaws. I'm full of faults. I'm full of sins." But imagine, Sister Stephanie, imagine if your kids came to you and said, "Mom, I've done this wrong and this wrong and this wrong, and I'm sorry." Said, "Come here, sweetheart. Come here, my son. Come here, my daughter. That's okay. It's why I'm Jesus. That's why I'm That's why I'm called the savior. &gt;&gt; I can take those sins. I just want you to come to me. I'll take the other stuff on myself. You just come to me. For those of you who haven't made that decision and and those of you that have made that decision, all of us here, every person present, please consider the purpose of this loss that we have lost and consider that this could be the greatest blessing that you have ever received in your whole life because it could mean a change in your life where now Sorrow can be replaced by joy. Sorrow of losing someone. Jesus mourned. It's okay. That's part of it. We should mourn. But there will be joy with that mourning. There will be happiness with that mourning. There it's like, Lord, here I am. I wish I could have seen Lazarus come out of that grave. I wish I could have been there. But the same Jesus Christ, he said, I am the same yesterday and today and forever. The same Jesus that was there is the same Jesus that can touch you and in your life. Just come to him. Bring your sins. Bring them with you and say, "Lord, here they are." And he says, "Listen, sweetheart. Come here. I love you. Don't worry about those. Just come to me." Jesus said, and I'll close with this, and I I don't know what is the next on the order of service, but I I'll close with this. that Jesus said, "Come to me all you that labor and are heavy laden. Come to me all you that are working and you're carrying a heavy load." And he said, "And I will give you rest." Consider it friends. Amen. Let's sing Amazing Grace there. Amazing [singing] grace, how sweet [music] the sound that save a wrench like [music] me. I once was lost but now am found. Was blind but [music] now I see. Now, as we go forward, the eulogy done by Jacob Valencia. I'm sorry, Valenuela. Somebody printed this really, really small. So, here you like to thank you all for coming and honoring my nephew Gilberella survived by his spouse Stephanie Cortas and his three children Sarah Grayson Nimalia and also by his father Ger Venuela and his mother's Esther Gar and his brother Jared Vanella and he was a beautiful person and he was um he felt like a son to me you know I I've um ever since he was a baby, I remember holding him, feeling, you know, smelling his skin, giving him a bath, taking him for walks, teaching him play piano, you know, he's super talented and um he's always demonstrated that all throughout his life, but he also had a huge heart and uh and he always wanted what was best. You know, he tried really hard for his family. He loved his kids and often we would get together and you know he bring his kids along with us. We go out to the he loved the outdoors and the wilderness and we go on hikes and hang out and with all the boys, you know, do the boy stuff and we had some so many good times together and and um I've always been impressed with him and you know I would we talk a lot on the phone, you know, and share our problems and share our joys as well and and he's super intelligent, you know, and he a lot of times I find myself asking him questions, you know, what do you think about this? what do you think about this? And he would he would talk to uncle be careful. Don't don't don't think about that too much. It's not good for you. You know, and um and he was very religious too. You know, we we talk for hours and we start getting to you know, scripture and and you know, times that we had with our family, you know, he respected and loved his grandparents very much and they set such a great example for all of us and for him as well. And then he remembered the teachings my dad would, you know, teach and and share with him and growing up. And um and so you know we found a lot of realizations and talking about just the times and you know and the examples we had growing up and but u yeah it's him and Jared and my brother Joseph and we're all closer in age so we we had a lot of time hanging out together and and he was he was such a talented you know and I had asked uh Steph if you know if she want to say something because so Evans took all my words because I was going to share what Steph said but I said that's beautiful. I said, you know, that's exactly what Nate was. You know, he [clears throat] had a huge heart. He had a memory like an elephant. He was incredible. I would teach him a song and, you know, by by road and he would just memorize everything and he would continue playing. He had such good sensibilities and until recently we were, you know, I told him, "Hey, you want to start a rea band?" And he said, "Yeah, love rea." So, I was like, "Okay, let's do this." You know, but he was so much fun to hang around with and I'm going to miss him as I'm sure many of you will. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; I just thank God for our family and for all the support that we've had and I think all of you as well for showing your support we the last week we've all been spending time with each other and I think it's really important that we stick together and you know help each other lean on each other cry on each other it's healthy it's good for you and I think this helped I don't think I'd be able to be up here if it wasn't for that and for hanging out with Jared and and having these long nights of, you know, talking and talking about all the great things that we experienced with with Nate, good and bad. I mean, we it was he was just a special soul, you know, and I think everybody realized that, you know, his friends and family, everybody saw that in him. He was such a strong person. He had a strong backbone, you know, and he did he stood up to everything, you know, and he's he's uh and so I just I want to thank every I want to thank my family for all your support cuz this is it was really difficult to lose someone like like Nate.

[singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; When that day comes and I find myself [music] standing [singing] in the sun, I can only imagine when all [singing] I will do is forever forever worship [music] you. I can only imagine. Oh, [music and singing] surrounded by your glory, but will my heart feel. Will I dance [music] for [singing] you, Jesus? Or in all of you, be still. Will I stand [music] in your presence? Or to my knees, will I fall? Will I sing hallelujah? [singing] Will I [music] be able to speak it all? I can only imagine. Oh, I [music] can only imagine. [singing] [music and singing] Surrounded by your glory. What will my heart feel? Will I dance for you, [music] Jesus, or in [singing] all of you be still? Will I stand in your presence or to my knees? [singing] Will I fall? Will I sing hallelujah? Will I be able [singing and music] to speak it all? I can only imagine. &gt;&gt; I can only imagine. [singing and music] &gt;&gt; I can only imagine. [singing] When all I will do is forever, forever worship you. I can only imagine. [singing] Can only imagine. &gt;&gt; Just make sure you're there that day and it won't be an imagination anymore, but it'll be a reality. &gt;&gt; And he makes an invite to you. Come, come. He says, I will receive you. You don't have to be perfect to come to him &gt;&gt; because none of us could come if we were, but if you'll come to him, he'll take care of situations. Now, as we we come to the end here and um again, I would say thank you as part of the family. All the family appreciates you being here showing your support, your love. But it doesn't end today. As many as as you can, as you often as you can remember them, greet them, lift them up, be a friend to them. So as we just let's just close our eyes and just and sometimes you have somebody leading the prayer but you pray too. You give your prayers towards a family and just ask God to to keep this day. Lord, as as we as we come to a finish here to an end and remembering this young man, part of the family and hearing the tribute that was given to him and to the family. Lord, it's it's it's good to hear the good things, the wonderful things, and that's just because you're good to us, Lord. But now as as [music] the days go on and the memories come back and times get hard, Lord, let us take time to reach out to one another. Encourage especially the family in this day, in this hour, Lord. And if anyone here, Lord, that has heard something about you that's made [music] their heart want to desire to know you, may they just ask. Ask someone who knows you and let us share that with them. The God that's alive, the same Jesus that spoke to Lazarus said, "Come out. You're still the same yesterday, today, and forever, Lord." So, we just want to say, [music] "Thank you for being mindful of the family." And Lord, may we be able to be with them and strengthen them, encourage them, Lord, in this time as they go through, Lord, as we commit the rest of this day to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The head of finishing song is when we all get to heaven. If you'll stand, we'll sing that together. You'll leave that there. Thank you. Sing the wondous [music and singing] love of Jesus. Sing his mercy and his [music] [singing] grace in the manions bright [music] and blessed. will prepare for us a place when we [music] all get to heaven. [singing] What a day of rejoicing [music] that [singing] will be when we [music] all see Jesus will sing and shout the victory. While we [singing] walk [music] the pilgrim pathway, clouds will [music] over spread the sky. But [music] when traveling days are over, not a shadow, [music] not a sigh. Oh, when we all [singing] get to heaven, what a day of rejoicing [music and singing] that will be when we all see Jesus. [singing] will sing and shout the victory when we all [singing] get to heaven. [music] What a day of rejoicing that will be when [music] we all see Jesus. will sing and [music and singing] shout the victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Main thing is let's make sure we're there &gt;&gt; when we all get to heaven. That means everybody here, let's make sure we all get there and that we are all able to sing and shout the victory when we get there. Now friends, we've honored our brother and I hope that as you leave today, I hope that something that was said will make you think and ask the Lord, Lord, am I right with you? Is my soul right with you, Lord? And when we do, when we all get to heaven, Lord, am I going to be there? And if there's something in your heart that you see that is preventing you from being there, we have ministers here. We have brother Aaron here. I'm here. Make sure, friends, don't let it go. Don't let it rest until you make that decision. And then once you make that decision to follow Jesus, then you have a promise. Lord, I'm going to be there. God bless you. Please, as brother Aaron said, don't forget the family. we're going to they'll get through this day and then there is going to be a void in their life forever now until we get to the other side and until we meet this lost loved one uh not lost from the Lord but lost from our immediate uh presence. So make sure to pray for the family. Make sure to reach out to the family in the future because they're going to need you. As I said, there's a void there. Let's fill that void. All right, friends. God bless you. We [music] have we have food afterwards. Let's bow our heads one more time. Father, we ask that your blessings are dressed upon the food that we're going to take. And then once again, Lord, that you would bless the family. Bless Stephanie. Lord, strengthen her. Lord, may the presence that is missing in her life be replaced by the presence of the Holy Spirit comforting her and guiding her. Bless the children. May the Holy Spirit as they get older, may it guide them, protect them, and be with them. Bless the mom, sister Esther, father, be with her, be with the dad. And Lord, we pray that your blessings as would rest upon the food and upon the remainder of the day. And Lord, we love you and we thank you for all that you do for us in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You're dismissed. You're welcome to greet the family here and uh and the food if you go out through the back door there probably where you came in. The fellowship hall is right on the other side of the wall here. God bless you.
