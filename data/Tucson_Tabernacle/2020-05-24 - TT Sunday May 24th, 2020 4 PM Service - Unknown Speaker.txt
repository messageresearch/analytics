he washed it white as a mint I'm thankful for that Amen tonight god bless you you happen to be in the house of the Lord amen it's been so good to be a church and I think it was refreshing just for all of us amen and to be gathered again so we're just appreciative of it we want to invite her brother loud to come now and I'm so glad and grateful he agreed to take the third-fastest him a few days ago so our flight unfortunately because of the kovat 19 we couldn't as we said this morning we couldn't get into Tucson so we had to go to Phoenix and then there was only one flight and it was really early in the morning so I've got to be at the airport about 5:00 a.m. so I debated actually planned on when asked by the law I would just go after this lunch today I'd go back to Phoenix and try to get some rest I thought I want to be there I want to hear it allow want to be able to take part so I thought well I'll just maybe move the service up so I hope this was okay so you did it for me and I appreciate that amen and I just wanted to take part I love worshiping the Lord I can't I'd rather be a Christian than anything I know Amen I'd rather be a church than anywhere I'd that I could think of I just love coming to church love coming to the house of God amen and just hearing the word of God did you come with an expectation you see Jesus is the shepherd he's the one who feeds us and he never disappoints he never lets you down you never leave you never leave hungry you always leave filled Amen so you just put your trust in him tonight take that need maybe something you have Amen upon your heart raise it up to the Lord say Lord Jesus go ahead if you got a need here tonight say Lord here's my need amen I'm gonna I'm gonna represent it by a hand and then I'm gonna put faith that you've called a brother and you're gonna use the office of ministry and you're gonna speak to my need amen I believe God can do that Lord willing we're trying to still make some plans here for coming back and I'm not sure if it'll be this week or the following what Lord willin looks like we'll be driving out and I'll have the whole family with me so I'll be I'll be really thankful for that amen so I'll be looking forward to that and also we'd like to just say one more thing concerning what we spoke about today I got a just a few more comments concerning it that uh you know we're not dogmatic about anything that we're doing with these are guidelines and recommendations and I think a guideline is something that we really are asking for your help with and then I recommend it would just be left up to you so so just continue to serve the Lord amen and then we'll see what happens for next weekend and then Wednesday night everything will be obviously we're gonna continue as we were today in the same guidelines and parameters that we set forth so we appreciate amen your cooperation with that I think there was a little bit of a question at the end that I probably blush was my fault with dismissal we had mentioned the Deacons will dismiss row by row but you know not everyone wants to dismiss missed and so I appreciate that I love lingering and worshiping the Lord and I believe everybody should be free to go when you want to go when you feel to go amen so when you feel to leave you can do that we're just trying to prevent a herd from going out you love you love the Lord amen I know that I do amen let's sing some we were singing this morning nobody loves me like you meet Jesus as we invited by the loudest look to the Lord now morning I see you in the sunrise every morn it's like a picture that you painted for love letter in the sky story sing it now store I could have had a really different store but you came down from heaven to restore forever forever sing raise your hands and singing down nobody loves me like you love me Jesus not standing no way I worship you as long as I am breathing God you are faithful and true nobody loves me like Mountains you're breaking down or mountains you're breaking down the way to pull my man even when it looks like I'm surrounded will you never leave my side Oh nobody loves me like you love me thank you Lord for that and not standing no and you [Music] God you are faithful and he loves me like is that true for you tonight it's certainly true for me I'm assuming this is working so that's always a good thing I was really encouraged this morning and really blessed by the message from brother Matt and in my case I was especially blessed because I I thought he'd taken a peek at some of my notes so that just served as a sort of a confirmation for me and I know I didn't read his it's hard it's hard to express how happy I am to be able to fellowship with my family in Christ my brothers and sisters each one of you and thinking about that I thought if I can remember how to do this because it's been a while we've got two pages up there how did that happen well we've got two pages up there I'd like us to sing together the family of God I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God I've been washed in the fountain cleansed by his blood joint heirs with Jesus as we travel this sod for I'm part of the family the family of God I apologize let's try it again and maybe I'll forget you know that the keys are really wide and the space is really narrow when you're a musician but when you're up here the spaces are really wide and the keys are really hard to find [Music] of God I've been washed in the fountain when spice one joint heirs with Jesus as we travel this part of the family the family are thank you very much and I just want to thank our musicians I want to thank sister Juliana and sister Angela thank you you you you probably don't realize the blessing that it's been when we've been sequestered in our homes to be able to have the streaming the effort the people brother Jordan and others that have made so much effort to bring that to us and the blessing that it's been to be able to just enter in to enter into worship to enter into fellowship and and just be a part of what's going on even though we're physically separated there's no distance in Christ there's no distance in the Lord I should also probably say that it's a little hard to express how surprised I am to be here this evening I've got a phone call from brother Matt late they pastor Matthew late Friday morning and I wasn't home at the time that you can be sure I hurried home I didn't exceed the speed limit by much and if it's okay I know you're still standing it's okay because this is honoring the Lord and only to sit in a minute but but I just like to share a little testimony with you you you all know the story about back and Thanksgiving of 2017 when I had the heart attack and got rushed into the ER and they weren't expecting me and yet within a few minutes they if a stet because I had 100% blockage on the right side of the heart and I was running at about two-thirds of a heart for quite a while until April of 2018 when in one of the at Wednesday evening services here not a special prayer line not anything like I just worshiping in the Lord and the Lord just made it very clear that he wanted you to worship Him well sure so but I noticed you know up until that time when we have song service after about 15 minutes I was just mouthing the words because I couldn't do it that Sunday morning Heather looked at me because I kept singing through the whole thing and I'm sure the people near me a next service at a little further away but but but but the Lord had touched me in that Tuesday that very week I went and it had an echocardiogram and the cardiologist said I can't tell any difference between your heart and a normal healthy heart thank the Lord well two years later Tuesday this last week Tuesday I went to the cardiologist again it was a different doctor this time but the same office and I did the echocardiogram and and she looked through all of this stuff and she came in and she said well you had this heart attack and you have this blockage here and that's now but but your hearts your heart is undamaged and I thought thank you look it's just like justification as if it had never happened I was just so grateful for that so I wanted to share that testimony of the Lord that it was two years ago that he touched my heart and it's just as touch now as it was then now you may have noticed some of you may have noticed that I'm not wearing my brown suit I'm wearing my birthday suit I wait that didn't come out right I wearing a suit that I got for my birthday that my my niece occupied Cavanaugh had had sent me and for my 70th birthday and so I'm wearing it tonight and if if she hears this or listen to whatever I want her to know that that that I'm wearing that someday someday we will all get a new birthday suit when we have that change in the body but but right now we'll just have to cover up the one that we've got and then of course finally finally I want to express the weight that I feel of responsibility of speaking to you fire that the Lord speak and continue what happened this morning and so if you join me in prayer before we read description Lord Jesus we are in all of you we are so grateful for your grace your love your mercy your kindness your long-suffering everything Lord that you do and continue to do for us and in spite of us Lord Lord I pray that you would just get Lyle Johnson out of the way Lord people didn't come here to hear Lyle Johnson they came to hear from Jesus Christ lord please please we thank you because we believe Lord we've come expecting you to move in our midst Lord and Lord we're we're just we're an anticipation of what you have for us we thank you forgive us Lord where we fall short and help us to to reflect and please you we ask in Jesus name Amen okay while we're standing yep please turn with me in your Bible if you will to Hebrews 11 it will just read the first four verses of this and then and then you can be seated Paul says here now faith Paul is going to do something for she's going to define faith for us faith is the substance of things hoped for it's the evidence of things not seen now that to see is to understand so this verse isn't talking about invisible things physically invisible the topic is defining faith faith gives substance to her hopes and it's presence is the evidence of our acceptance of things we may not fully understand or comprehend we can't quite see it but yet we know it's there for by it but by what by faith the elders who are the elders which elders before those who have gone on before obtained a good report and Paul will share a little bit of that report with us it's through faith whose faith Paul's brother branham's as brother Aaron keeps telling us put your name there through faith put your name there Lyle Johnson understands that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so that things which are seen we're talking about physical now things which are seen were not made by things which do appear God did not use an erector set or Lego blocks by faith this was the substance of his hope by faith the evidence of something that he maybe didn't fully understand Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain case may have been excellent James may have been excellent but Abel's was more excellent an and by which but by what by the sacrifice was it really the sacrifice but was it the faith behind the sacrifice that he able Abel obtained witness that he that Abel was righteous well who gave that witness Paul tells us God testifying of his gifts you can't get it better or more important witness than God God testifying of his gifts and buy it buy it buy what his faith in God's testimony of his faith Abel being dead yet speaks being dead yet speaks present tense not being dead yet spoke speaks today today yet speaks okay I'm going to be reading a fairy but tonight please sit down righteousness by faith and when did that of righteousness by faith it was after he offered the sacrifice it wasn't during it wasn't before he didn't go to Ikea and follow a careful set of little cartoon directions of how to build an altar now to build a fire oh no no the listen it wasn't some complicated liturgy where you get a lantern and you put incense in it and you swing it three times and you say this particular phrase there was none of that he didn't know that he didn't know that but it was his faith expressed through the act of sacrifice that's what it was Paul continues listing some of that good report of the elders note if you've read it and I'm sure you have but that list isn't just preacher so-and-so and prophet so-and-so and judge so-and-so there's a lot of ladies that are mentioned in there too heroes of faith don't come in one particular sex well I'm gonna skip now to verse 32 Paul is still talking about these things now he says what more shall I say he's given us this list and some of those things in that list are pretty amazing when you think of well I don't want to go down that rabbit trail he says for the time would fail me to tell of gideon or baraka or samson or jeff jela and David also Samuel the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again we all like to read our victories we like to celebrate victories if you go to a look at ancient Egyptian texts and read the hieroglyphics or somebody that claims to read them to you you'll notice that the Egyptians never talked about a defeat you think that they never lost a battle or a war that's why you don't find any archaeological evidence in Egyptian stuff about Moses and the exodus because that was a defeat but I'm not talking about Egypt tonight it's ok get back on track I'll notice Paul is using characters not-not-not figments of people's imagination it's not from a from a Hollywood movie or from where they call it now a graphic novel a comic book it's not there's no superheroes involved here of the imagination these are real people who lived real lives that are recorded in part and what we call the old testament well let's continue on because there's the other side others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings a moreover of bonds and imprisonment I'm sure Paul could certainly relate to some of that even as he's writing this they were stoned they were sawn asunder they were tempted they were tested were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented and Paul tells us of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and in caves of the earth and these all the victors and the ones that seemed like they might have been somewhat less victorious these all having obtained a good report whose filling out the report God through faith received not the promise the redemption of the body errors of the world they didn't receive that it wasn't yet that time it wasn't that season as we heard this morning to everything there's a time in his season God having provided some better thing for us what what what better thing what what better thing Paul tells us in Hebrews 719 the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto God some better thing for us that they the elders those that have gone before they without us where's your name without brother Aaron they without Lyle Johnson they without you and you and you and you could not be made perfect the final perfection the immortal body and from this we can draw the conclusion that they with us put your name in there they with us will be made perfect they will be fully redeemed and so will we now not every victory is won that's easy to celebrate not everyone returns home from battle and those who do are rarely unscathed brother Branham talks about battle-scarred veterans in fact is pastor Matthews been reminding us it's through battles and trials and obstacles that we build character and see the hand of God in our lives our job is not to test the Lord our job is to trust the Lord while he tests us each church age passage and the book of the revelation of Jesus Christ is addressed to the ones who overcome all seven of those passages and with to him that overcometh to him that overcometh battle battle I'd like you if you have your Bible turn to the book of Job the nineteenth chapter we'll begin at the 25th verse now this is what's typically read at funerals and it's okay we're not going to be rolling a casket in here tonight here we go Joe for I I know and put your name there this isn't just reading about Jobe this is the Word of God to us for I Lyle Johnson I put in your name no there's no guesswork here isn't what we know I know that I love Heather I know that I know that Heather loves me there's no doubt there's no guesswork it's not hope it's certainty i know that my redeemer lyle johnson's redeemer your redeemer and by the way that redeemer is as we've been hearing from the book of ruth that redeemer has to be a kinsman has to be a kinsman either through marriage or through blood has to be a kinsman that Redeemer the only one that can redeem me lives I know that do you know that I know that that he lives and that he my Redeemer Jesus Christ shall stand at the latter day upon the earth it's gonna it's certainty and though after Lyle Johnston's put in your name skin worms destroy this body this birthday suits gone right after the skin worms destroy this body it's consumed it's kind you can't find a trace of it anywhere yet in my flesh shall Lyle Johnson see God put your name there you will whom I I will see for myself and mine your eyes shall behold and not another not another doesn't mean there won't be somebody else there too there's gonna be lots of us there but you're not gonna see eyes you're going to see it you're gonna witness it you're gonna be a part of it yourself so we see here regardless of the physical outcome regardless of one way or find the caught a way to be with the Lord even if we die before that time we will live to see that day and we will be perfected in Christ it's not that we hope we will I know my Redeemer liveth we will be perfected and not by ourselves not or just this generation or just his fellowship it's not just us no they without us implies it without them we wouldn't be made perfect either reaching back through the mists of time and forward to whatever time might remain for Humanity but it's right here right now we're in this together the body of Christ fitly joined together or in this together now when when pastor Matthew asked me about speaking this evening I thought well you know I've got there's a lot of topics I'd like to share with you there's there's a lot of things I said these last several weeks when we've been more sequestered than normal I've been taking into a lot of things one of the things that I did was I took an introductory course and Heather took it with me it was for non-scientists on modern physics about relativity and quantum mechanics okay you say you say yeah yeah well the parallels between that and the last future changes are astounding they're in lockstep talk about the natural being a type of the spiritual the natural universe modeling or giving us imperfect glimpses into the unseen spiritual world I I identified a little bit with that character that story character not a real character that brother branham talks about and several messages where there's this fellow and his daughter was gonna have the ladies with the church over for tea and this guy would just get excited about so if he be reading in the Bible and then he start stomping and jumping around and shouting and she wanted to keep him quiet so she she he agreed that he'd go up in the attic and she gave him a geography what could be more boring than a geography she gave him the geography I will keep him quiet he's upstairs they're having their tea things are going along and then suddenly hallelujah whoa Oh dad what is he doing runs upstairs and and and what is it dad what what did you find a Bible appear something what's going on no no I was reading into geography and I saw Europe and South America whatever but I got you a place where it said there's places in the ocean that as of the time this geography was written they hadn't found the bottom of yet and I thought praise God my Caesar throne my sins are thrown into the sea and I just couldn't contain myself okay so so what happened so he was excited about the geography well I got pretty excited about some of this physics stuff I have to admit well I we also have been digging into some of the history of ancient Egypt archaeology the eastern Mediterranean seeing how it ties into the lives of Joseph and Moses what what we can draw and find from that perspectives on life in Israel from the time of Joshua to the time of Jesus church history history of Judaism all sorts of things so I thought oh okay Lord after prayer and seeking the guidance of the Holy Spirit for this evening I said Lord what are these can I share tonight which of these can I dig into and what did you say nope nope what happens panic I've only got a day and a half to prepare go what what Lord Lord Lord what do you want me to share that will be helpful for at least someone in the congregation you probably have all seen this picture in the past in the house of my child though with the raising of the flag on Mount Suribachi and uwajima it was hanging out a bedroom wall it was signed by the photographer Joe Rosenthal of The Associated Press it was a small scrap of slightly yellowing paper typewritten for those of you there don't know what typewriters a mechanical thing that sort of like a printer and that small scrap of paper it had Philippians 4:13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me and there's a little kid growing up and learning to read and always seeing that picture and I wondered what's that pictured there but what does it ask my dad and and and why is that first stuck in that picture what's going on here and and you just say well it's a photo of Marines raising the flag on Mount Suribachi well if you tell that to Abel he's just gonna give you a funny look and I'm sure I gave my dad a funny look too but but that's kind of what I was told and left with it I wasn't told it was on emoji WA II wajima there was no additional explanation given to this curious little kid Lord what would you have me share with a congregation tonight and my thoughts began to focus I'm tomorrow's national holiday Memorial Day Memorial Day isn't the kind of day where you say happy Memorial Day it isn't about barbecues it isn't about military veterans it isn't about those that are serving in uniform today Memorial Day is about remembering and mourning the loss of the people who defended our country that didn't come home unless it was in a body bag or a casket it's about reflecting on the great cost in lives to secure and maintain the freedoms that we enjoy and the values that we cherish it's about reflecting on how great a cost are we am I willing to pay to allow others to share these freedoms the holiday was originally called decoration day and it started as a their lives during the Civil War it was first observed nationally on May 30th 1868 so one of the oldest holidays we have it was always on May 30th through 1970 then Congress passed a law and made it the last the last Monday of May well you know there's there's a comment we did to Joseph Stalin Joseph Stalin was a brutal dictator of the Soviet Union from 1924 until his death in 1953 and it's often paraphrased in this way what one death is a tragedy a million deaths is just and it reminded me it's a bit like today we learned that almost a hundred thousand Americans have died from or with covin 19 but unless you know someone who has suffered or succumbed or lost their livelihood because of it it's a statistic a sad statistic but it's a statistic well this is a photo of my father's younger sibling Vernon Johnson I carry his name is my middle name Lyle Vernon Johnson my Uncle Vernon who was born in Berkeley California during the flu pandemic of 1918 he was newly married and in the summer of 1944 was drafted for the war effort in the Pacific at the age of 25 or 26 private Johnson was assigned to and served with the 24th Marines 4th division Memorial Day 1945 was a very hard day for my dad my mom my dad siblings his parents many of their friends the war had ended in Europe on May 8th it wouldn't end in the Pacific until August 15th sometime between May 8th and May 30th my grandfather and grandmother were notified that Vernon probably would not be coming home he was listed as missing in action on March 2nd 1945 during the battle for Iwo Jima it wasn't until the 1960s or 70s that his status was changed to killed in action one of 6,800 Americans who lost their lives on that tiny desolate rocky island and the vast Pacific Ocean my grandmother couldn't biggest child being missing was he alive was he dead there's no certainty there's no closure was he in Japanese hands was he first horrible way dying like those on the Death March of the tongue maybe he'd escaped and was hiding somewhere if so would he be found was he languishing in some despicable prison in the Pacific would she get news that for Imperial Japan surrendered in August at that they found him he was he was in a prison someplace and he's alive and they was finally gonna come home there were no answers for a grieving mother my grandmother became a casualty not listed or the battle for Iwo Jima she was in and out of the state mental hospital in California she died in that hospital e years later in 1953 that's that's a photo of my grandfather visiting her at the hospital trying to encourage her and comfort her she was yet another immigrant who came to America married a kind and general Christian man and lost her baby boy to War Memorial Day is to remember the fallen to mourn and yet terrifies us to appreciate not to celebrate it's about battles it's about battles what did we hear this morning it's about battles it's not about picnics but this is a church we worship Jesus Christ this isn't a civic center for a national memorial this is not a cemetery we're not gathered here tonight to wave the Stars and Stripes or mourn the loss of loved ones who gave that last full measure so that we can enjoy the freedoms then why are you bringing this up because I believe that the Lord wants to remind us that we are in the midst of a battle where within the greatest war of all time the fight between good and evil to struggle between God and Satan and we aren't just in it we're not spectators of a crowd cheering our team or our side or watching a couple of gladiators battle no we're expected we're not expected we're required to join the fight we're required to be soldiers on the frontlines this is a battle it's not a picnic Paul tells us in Ephesians chapter 6 starting at verse 10 finally my brethren and search yourself finally while Johnson the worshippers at Tucson Tabernacle finally be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might it's his strength not our weakness and search your name error lyall answers your name put on the whole armour of God this this isn't a suggestion this is not a suggestion put on the whole armour of God why why it's kind of bulky and that she may be able to stand against the wiles the craftiness the deceits of the devil armor as defensive it's to protect us from the enemy's attacks for we wrestle we now this is a get put your name in here for me each of us wrestle not against flesh and blood or a virus but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world brother Branham called this Satan's Eden against spiritual wickedness in high places that's not talking about the White House or the government and the Bible high places are places of worship there were they they went up to high places and put up idols and worship calves and all that sort of thing spiritual wickedness in places of worship we're fighting against that wherefore take unto you again put in your name take take unto yourself the whole armour of God not the party light note the part you're comfortable with not the part that looks spiffy you need it all that ye but you and me each of us may be able to withstand the evil day what's the evil day March 24th 2020 if the God gives us tomorrow March 25th 2020 the evil day is today and having done all Oh what is all putting on that armor having put on that armor stand don't sit don't hide don't cower at some point your exit training and you go into the battleground stand therefore he's encouraging as Paul is now stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth not not with lies not with guesses not with suppositions we have a sure word in our day remember when when when Jesus stood before Pilate and he said I'm like aim to testify of the truth and Pilate said what's truth that's how he regarded truth but what did Jesus say in another place I am the way the truth the life the truth isn't just a set of indisputable facts the truth is a person the truth is a spirit it's a spirit of Jesus Christ having on the breastplate what does a breastplate do it protects your chest to protect your heart it protects your lungs receive the Holy Spirit the breath of life put on the breastplate of righteousness what is a breastplate of righteousness abraham believed God and it was counted to him as righteousness do you believe God tonight do I remember this is to ward off the wiles the attacks of the devil and your feet fit this we're not paratroopers we're not mechanised infantry or we're not riding around in tanks that's not the kind of armor we're talking about where we march this is infantry so your feet that's how you march to an engage in battle and you don't want to use those feet to run from it shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace it takes prepper training practice a person that's gonna run a marathon doesn't just get up one day from the breakfast table push the chair back and say oh there's a marathon today I think I'm gonna run it they train and train and train otherwise they collapse at about mile zero point one right above all above all taking the shield of faith what is it about a shield a shields not like a breastplate we're strapped you you holding the shield it's mobile its defensive you can see where the attack is coming from and ward it off you have to see the attack that's coming you have to move the shield you have to ward it off but if you put it in the right place if you put it in the right place the shield of faith not of doubt where with you put in your name shall be able to quench the fiery darts of the wicked the shield if you put it in the right place and we'll make the attacks of the enemy ineffective it'll cause a little frustration on the other side and take the helmet then the helmet protects your head protects your mind protect your eyes they home it ok so far this this armor is all defensive in nature and what's next and the sword of spirit which is a Word of God now we're moving into offensive weaponry it's not just defense we're not just warding off flows now we can attack it's how we take the battle to the enemy you never win a war or a football game by defense only you need effective offense to overpower the enemy an effective defense to deflect his attacks and it isn't just weapons it's not like wow I've got all this stuff like when David was a young man and he came to the camped where his brothers were part of the army except they had forgotten that they were in a battle they were kind of cowering and there's this big guy Goliath up there that's making all this noise these challenges and David goes there and and and he's just there to check on his brothers and maybe he thought it was a picnic he brought him some food or something right but it turned out that it was a battle it wasn't a picnic so what did he do he said I could do this with God's help I can do this and they and they finally agreed to let him do it and they have this big pile of stuff well here's this armor and here's this helmet and here's this sword that you could hardly pick and David said no preparation I've never used this stuff before I don't know how this works I've got a sling I'll go down to the brook Oh Oh get some stones and he got those stones and he waved each one in his hand was the right weight the right shape he put her in his pouch and it wasn't a sling that he had just gotten the day before on his birthday he'd used this thing he knew how to wield it he knew how to use the weapon that he had and he used it okay let's move on okay continuing on remember with offensive weapons now we've had the defense we're into offense praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit okay strange as it may seem prayer is our most powerful defense as well as our offense its experience its training it's clear communications to receive orders so you can execute the battle plan with precision and coordination with the other soldiers that are fighting this battle with you and watching all prayer supplications and watching what is that be alert sleep with one eye open keep your lamp trimmed and clear right washing thereunto with all perseverance what is perseverance never give up never surrender accept his brother Aaron's been telling us on Wednesday night surrender to the Lord but never surrender to the enemy and supplication for All Saints it's not just for yourself we're in this together I was talking to brother Larry get her a few weeks just after service briefly one before we went into our sequester and he said he said I pray for you you pray for me that's how it works that's exactly it it's not complicated but it's essential and for me Paul in this case Paul's making his personal now he says you do this you put on this and and and and while you're doing this don't forget me Paul that utterance words that words may be given unto me Paul the first church age messenger that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel the mystery of the gospel Christo and vosotros plus fir'aun's de Gloria Christ in you the hope of glory right Colossians 1:26 Paul this is the Apostle the church age messenger the fellow who basically founded the Christian religion Jesus wasn't a Christian Jesus was Jewish right but he forms the basis of our Christian faith and doctrine and belief and he points out that without the backing of prayer without the backing of other believers he's gonna fail just as we heard this morning the things that I would do I don't do it the things that I shouldn't do I find myself doing I need your support I need your prayer Paul is saying we need each other support each other's prayers and he asks for boldness if you're gonna carry the battle to the enemy offense requires boldness for which Paul says he is an ambassador or as an ambassador as a representative the ambassador of the United States to to Russia is in Moscow but he speaks for the United States he speaks on behalf of the United States Paul says I'm an ambassador a representative for Christ and bonds but even so that they're in as an ambassador in spite of my bonds I may speak boldly he's again asking for boldness not to speak harshly not to speak condemning Li but to speak without fear speaking what he knows to be the truth regardless of the consequences that I may speak boldly as I ought to speak he's repeating this request Paul knew his mission he knew his strengths he knew his weaknesses he knew what he had to do but he's still implored whoever read this letter to pray for him that he'll be able to do what he knows he needs to do Jesus and guests Emmett he was looking for backup he told his disciples watch with me they fell asleep are you sleeping Am I we see that were to be dressed for battle and it's not just dress it's not a costume party it's not just put on this buffer now you're a soldier there's training that's involved it's one thing to dress like a soldier it's another to be one but we are to be properly and completely outfitted trained and prepared Jesus told us we talked about this a few months ago Jesus is the bread of life he's the fountain of living waters he'll sustain us we need to engage the enemy boldness to take the battle to the enemy well if you're going to do that if I'm going to take the battle to the enemy if if my Uncle Vernon was gonna fight the Japanese on Iwo Jima but he was in Sydney Australia he's not going to be engaged in the battle you've got to know where that battle ground is we know where that battle ground is brother branham told us the greatest battle we'll ever fight is in the battleground of our minds in 1962 he preached in March just a couple of excerpts from the greatest battle ever fought when great battle started on earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected it's not random a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to rage it's not just an easy gentle all throw a stick at you you threw his stick at me the battle rages and that battle grounds begin in the human mind that's where the battle starts the human mind was chosen we were created the human mind was chosen for the place of battle where it was began that is because that decisions are made from the mind the head a little later he says decisions are made in the mind the head that is where Satan meets you and the decisions are because God made a man that way a little later he says it must be accepted in the mind that's first that's the battleground you win the mind you take the heart right it must be accepted in the mind then it's believed with a heart first the mind then the heart doesn't work the other way believe with the heart then after loosing their head yard then the word of God becomes a reality oh then every senses of soul and body has just scoured out with the Holy Spirit then your sense of God your conscience of God everything that's godly flows through you does it come from you it comes from him but it flows through there's not a doubt anywhere there's nothing can rise up ok so notice further in Ephesians fix 6 there's listed no mirror there's no looking-glass in a modern army that there's a buddy system you put on your gear and your buddy checks to be sure that it's all right if you're jumping out of the airplane if you're a paratrooper you want somebody to check to be sure that that strapped on right or there's gonna be a mess in a few minutes right and he he confirms yours is correct you confirm his is correct you trust him with your life he trusts you with his life it's well there's nothing new about the buddy system that's how Jesus sent His disciples look in mark 6 and he called him to him the twelve and began to send him forth well you go here and you three go there and no no he sent him forth two-by-two and gave him power over unclean spirits John the Baptist did the same thing in Luke 7 and John calling unto him two of his disciples not three not five in the mouth of two witnesses that everything two of his disciples to Jesus saying art that he that should come or do we look for another referring again to Hebrews 11 Paul lists several names some of you may recall a couple of years ago when we were talking about Abraham hebrews records his faith Genesis reveals his flaws lately in our morning devotions Heather and I have been reading from the book of Judges for me personally this is a very difficult portion of the Bible to read and it may not simply be due to the seemingly wanton violence the incredible cruelty just regard for God the almost instant reversion to carnality when God helps them out of their latest bad spot maybe maybe it's difficult for me because I don't want to see myself reflected in the actions of the descendants of Jacob or in the character flaws of so many of the judges maybe maybe it's hard to read because I do see many of those same flaws and those same problems in my own life Paul lists among the heroes of faith gideon samson jephthah all three had serious flaws yet God saw fit to use them in their day and celebrate their faith and Hebrews eleven he could look beyond their present circumstances even their continued ongoing disobedience that which I would do I find myself not doing that which Paul had that same kind of problem right as he empowered them to fulfill his purposes through them we have to carry the battle but it's not about us it's not our strength it's his strength it's not our weakness it's not our flaws in spite of these flaws and lapses maybe the book of Judges is really emphasizing the grace of God and it pretty well leaves us leaves Lyle Johnson put your name in there without excuses well I'm closing now probably be a good time for the musicians to consider coming this way I found this image it's the final war bond Drive of world war two I found I thought eerily appropriate to end tonight's message this is the seventh war bond Drive you'll see the big seven on there the end of that war bond Drive the end of that seventh Drive ended in victory for our nation and unconditional surrender of our enemies this is the seventh Church age this is Laodicea it's going to culminate in the ultimate victory over our enemies these guys are doing what they're raising the standard in this case it's the Stars and Stripes we need to raise the standard of Jesus Christ over the battleground over our minds even as the battle is raging to graph that this is based on they just always taken on February 23rd of 1945 the Battle of Iwo Jima was raging it took two or three more weeks before the battle was over and look at the message on the poster now altogether and isn't that exactly what we need to be now now especially now all together we are in this together as I trying to service over to Pastor Matthew I'd like to have a sing his banner over
