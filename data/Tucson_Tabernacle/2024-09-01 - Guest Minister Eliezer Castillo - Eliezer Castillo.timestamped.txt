[45:14] Amen I I believe that's each and every
[45:17] one of our prayer that we can say it Is
[45:20] Well with our
[45:21] soul um there's a verse there where it
[45:25] says that though Satan he he buff at me
[45:28] I just asked brother uh brother uh Evans
[45:32] what that means and he says it it's to
[45:34] beat and what that's what the devil does
[45:37] is he's he's going to beat us he's going
[45:41] to try to put things in our minds he's
[45:44] going to hurt our
[45:46] body he's our our body is going to be
[45:49] sick or we're going to be tired in our
[45:52] lives there's going to be things going
[45:54] through our
[45:55] minds but even though we go through all
[45:57] of these things it is well in my
[46:02] soul that's the amazing
[46:06] thing God has that reserve for himself
[46:11] that little place that little hidden
[46:14] spot and that's why we come to church
[46:16] and that's why we want to serve the Lord
[46:19] because God can protect your soul even
[46:23] though you've gone through many things
[46:24] in your life God has res reserved your
[46:27] soul for
[46:29] himself and we can sing it as
[46:32] well let us bow our
[46:36] heads Heavenly
[46:38] Father what an appropriate song it is
[46:43] Father just to come up here and to know
[46:46] Lord that you have the
[46:49] control and though we go through many
[46:51] things Lord each and every person they
[46:54] have their own little battles their own
[46:57] little trials
[46:58] father but if we can
[47:01] realize that when we accept you father
[47:05] when we accept the Supreme sacrifice of
[47:08] Jesus Christ and we accept your Holy
[47:12] Spirit father you H have reserved us and
[47:15] protected us father and though this body
[47:18] is beat down though things come in our
[47:22] lives and they go in out of our Lives
[47:25] father yet we can be
[47:27] assured father that we are standing in
[47:30] un an unmovable Rock father we're
[47:33] standing in your word we're standing in
[47:36] your
[47:37] sacrifice that whenever all of the
[47:40] things are going on in this world
[47:42] they're crumbling away they're uncertain
[47:44] we can sing this beautiful song It Is
[47:47] Well with My Soul father I ask Lord that
[47:51] you just put that peace in each and
[47:53] every person here this
[47:55] morning Lord we're all going through
[47:57] something doesn't matter how spiritual
[47:59] we are if we've just given our heart to
[48:02] the Lord if we've been serving you for
[48:04] years father we are all going through
[48:06] something Lord and I just ask that you
[48:09] touch each and every person bless the
[48:11] word that is about to be read father and
[48:14] just I ask that you just take control
[48:16] father forgive us of every trespass
[48:19] every transgression that we've committed
[48:22] even just this morning Lord we ask that
[48:24] you just put us under your blood and and
[48:27] take control with your spirit in the
[48:29] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[48:31] amen and
[48:33] amen amen what a beautiful song Amen I
[48:37] love that we can um listen to these
[48:40] songs and I'm sure we've listened to
[48:42] them for years but I think the key to
[48:45] worship it's not just a ritual maybe it
[48:48] seems like it because we do it you know
[48:50] in the beginning of the preaching after
[48:52] the preaching but if you take that
[48:54] personal in your lives you take every
[48:57] single song and you apply it to your
[48:59] life then just singing isn't just
[49:02] singing you're you're worshiping and it
[49:04] becomes a testimony in your life and um
[49:08] so it's such a beautiful thing just to
[49:10] let go and to Worship the Lord if you'd
[49:13] like to turn with me to a very um simple
[49:15] scripture Proverbs
[49:19] 23:7 whenever you have it just go ahead
[49:21] and say
[49:22] [Music]
[49:23] Amen Proverbs 23:7 and and um I'm going
[49:27] to I'm try not to hold you too long and
[49:31] um just such a simple thought in my mind
[49:34] that I I just want
[49:36] to just relay with each and every one of
[49:39] you and I pray that the Lord um blesses
[49:41] us through his
[49:44] word um so the Bible it
[49:48] says for as a man thinketh in his heart
[49:52] so is he eat and drink saith he to thee
[49:56] but his heart heart is not with thee let
[49:59] us do a little prayer before we sit down
[50:02] lord we just read your word we commit
[50:05] this service into your hands we ask that
[50:07] you take preeminence thank you Lord in
[50:10] the name of Jesus Christ amen let us sit
[50:14] and um just get
[50:16] comfortable um I honestly I didn't have
[50:20] a a title until I literally was walking
[50:22] up I I didn't know what to call it so I
[50:25] just um titled it the battle for
[50:28] control and um the scripture is showing
[50:31] that whatever we think we
[50:33] are so as a man thinketh in his heart so
[50:38] is
[50:39] he and um that's a very simple um
[50:43] scripture I'm sure those that haven't
[50:45] even heard that scripture before they
[50:47] understand it because what we think
[50:50] that's what we
[50:51] become now I I got a question for each
[50:53] and every person who who's thought
[50:55] something bad this just this this past
[50:57] week we all have but let's not get
[51:01] scared because it's not just a thought
[51:04] that just comes in that that forms us
[51:07] into the person we are thoughts come and
[51:11] go sometimes there they call them
[51:13] intrusive thoughts right bad thoughts
[51:15] come and those bad thoughts they go and
[51:18] those aren't the thoughts that we're
[51:20] talking about we're not talking about
[51:21] just something that we accidentally
[51:23] think we accidentally think something
[51:25] wrong about somebody or we actually
[51:28] accidentally think something wrong about
[51:29] ourselves or whatever it might be those
[51:32] thoughts they come and they go and we
[51:34] have to understand that those thoughts
[51:36] those are alien thoughts amen me meaning
[51:39] that they're they're not coming from the
[51:41] source within
[51:42] us a lot of times it comes from certain
[51:46] circumstances and they come and they
[51:48] go but what this is talking about it's a
[51:53] I just learned this word let me see if I
[51:55] can say it's a
[51:57] contemplative
[51:59] thought to
[52:01] contemplate to to let it relay in our
[52:05] mind all the time and we we allow a a
[52:10] thought to just sit there in our mind
[52:13] and we almost create it as a habit and
[52:16] we just think things these these things
[52:19] then we begin to be formed by the things
[52:21] that we think and this is just not for
[52:24] for Christians but this scripture is
[52:27] actually talking about somebody that
[52:29] that is deceitful to somebody else and
[52:32] he's saying as a man thinketh in his
[52:34] heart so is he he could say Come on come
[52:37] eat with me come sit down let's have a
[52:39] good time but his heart is not with
[52:42] you so he he's he's doing something
[52:45] deceptive but his heart shows him who he
[52:49] is his thinking shows him who he is and
[52:52] and that's what our lives they are a
[52:55] result of what we have in our
[52:58] minds what we allow the things to come
[53:00] in I I was studying I'm not going to
[53:02] talk about it but I was studying about
[53:04] media and and media is a medium or a a
[53:08] middle place of information so there's a
[53:11] source there's a middle place and
[53:13] there's the
[53:14] receiver and we have to think about what
[53:18] kind of media are we taking in and I'm
[53:20] not just talking about the news and I'm
[53:21] not talking at social media but I'm
[53:23] talking about words and and things we
[53:26] watch and people we talk to what are we
[53:29] taking
[53:30] in and those things we're taking in
[53:33] we're taking into our thoughts and we
[53:36] allow those thoughts to sit down and
[53:39] make a nice um little room there in our
[53:42] in our mind until we become those very
[53:45] thoughts that we think so we're not um
[53:49] you know we ask God for forgiveness for
[53:51] the thoughts that we think we ask God
[53:53] for forgiveness for for when we get
[53:56] angry or when we get some kind of
[53:58] thought we go to the Cross right
[54:00] away and we allow the Lord to wipe that
[54:04] out we go out out of that
[54:06] thought and we keep going that's not
[54:10] what forms you it's the things that you
[54:12] allow to sit there and um we know that
[54:16] that's as simple as that is that's how
[54:18] this whole world was taken over by by
[54:21] somebody going into somebody else's ear
[54:24] and giving deceptive words
[54:27] and and and brother bam said that he
[54:30] that that the serpent went he spoke to
[54:32] Eve and he took control of the whole
[54:35] entire world it wasn't by force it
[54:38] wasn't by a legion of angels it was by
[54:41] allowing somebody to be deceived into
[54:45] thinking they were doing the right thing
[54:47] that's true amen so he goes over there
[54:49] tells them this great
[54:52] thing they accept it in their mind and
[54:55] then they do
[54:57] it and because that was done the whole
[55:00] world went into
[55:03] chaos sometimes we have to look around
[55:05] our world we say okay where is this
[55:08] chaos coming
[55:10] from where is these things and a lot of
[55:12] times it's it's because the result of
[55:15] the thoughts we allow in in our
[55:17] minds so he didn't go face to face even
[55:21] even you know this is my mind you can
[55:24] take take it or leave it you know it's
[55:26] up to to you but just by the way I see
[55:29] the word it said that that Satan drew
[55:33] his tail and Drew the angels
[55:36] in and if we've ever heard brother Brown
[55:38] he said it was the tale he told so it
[55:41] was him talking wow it was him maybe
[55:46] miscuing or skewing the word of God and
[55:48] saying No this is how it really is and
[55:52] people accepting it to the point where
[55:56] that was the war it was a if you want to
[55:58] call it a political
[55:59] war we when we think about wars we think
[56:02] about cannons we think about swords we
[56:04] think about
[56:06] artillery but these are Spiritual Beings
[56:09] here so what was it he said it was a
[56:12] tail he
[56:13] told that Drew the angels and and he was
[56:17] kicked out we can we can think about it
[56:20] we can try to imagine it we can imagine
[56:22] with swords I could even imagine it as a
[56:25] political but we don't know is it was a
[56:27] spiritual
[56:28] battle right but we know that it was a
[56:31] tale he told and people accepted it in
[56:35] their
[56:36] minds and it changed them it changed
[56:39] them from a good condition to a bad
[56:41] condition even when when U there's a
[56:45] story or it's not a story but it was a
[56:46] scripture in Jude I believe in Jude
[56:49] um uh let me see it's in Jude 8 where it
[56:53] talks about how there's there's filthy
[56:55] dreamers
[56:56] that defile the flesh despise dominion
[56:59] and speak evil of dignities so there's
[57:02] words speaking evil and then after he
[57:05] says all of those things then in verse 9
[57:08] he says Yet Michael now he's he's
[57:11] Shifting the the the scene and he's
[57:13] saying Yet Michael when he was
[57:15] contending for Moses's
[57:17] body and disputing for Moses contending
[57:21] with the devil disputing for Moses's
[57:23] body he res restrained
[57:26] himself from saying
[57:31] accusations and and the the people when
[57:34] they think about that scripture they'll
[57:35] be like man they had big old sores they
[57:37] had their wings out there but it was
[57:39] saying they were contending and
[57:41] disputing this is a discussion they're
[57:45] having and and and what the devil does
[57:48] it says that that people which are are
[57:51] anointed by the devil they say they
[57:53] speak evil of dignities what the devil
[57:55] will do because he will will speak evil
[57:59] he doesn't care he doesn't have no
[58:00] respect of God so he will put thoughts
[58:03] in people's minds that are
[58:06] evil and and even though the devil he'll
[58:09] he'll play dirty and do those things Yet
[58:12] Michael refrained himself to even accuse
[58:16] the devil to even speak
[58:19] evil that sounds like a like a a battle
[58:23] of words or or political battle
[58:27] and but the devil he don't care he he
[58:29] will put thoughts he will put
[58:32] words and he will
[58:35] hurt but um that's that's how the devil
[58:39] he he took over that's how the devil
[58:41] takes over and and um and that's how he
[58:45] takes over people's
[58:46] lives is by attacking the
[58:50] mind he he attacks the mind um there's a
[58:54] message that brother brandham preaches
[58:55] is called the greatest battle ever
[58:57] fought really good message especially if
[58:59] we want to understand you know um inside
[59:03] of us what's going on in in US brother
[59:05] brandham he preaches a really good
[59:07] message about what's going on that man
[59:09] is a Triune being a soul body spirit and
[59:13] and he he says something there where he
[59:15] says that that God picked a part of a
[59:18] man and same picked a part of a
[59:21] man and and and and God took the heart
[59:25] yes Satan took the mind right and he
[59:28] didn't take it he didn't take it so that
[59:31] he can be there nice and comfortable
[59:32] because our soul It Is Well with My Soul
[59:36] that is where eternal life
[59:38] stays so he doesn't want the mind he
[59:42] picked it because he doesn't have no
[59:45] rights to our soul he has no rights to
[59:48] my eternal salvation to who I really
[59:52] am so he picked the mind and he be began
[59:56] to attack in it wow and and he explains
[59:59] this scripture I mean in this message
[1:00:02] how how it this this great human B I
[1:00:05] mean this Angel battle dropped down to
[1:00:08] earth and became human battles and the
[1:00:10] battle was in the mind wow now I want
[1:00:14] you guys I'm going to try to paint a
[1:00:15] picture and I want us to picture it that
[1:00:18] there's a battle and and battles and
[1:00:21] Battlegrounds they're not pretty to look
[1:00:23] at there's fox holes there's these Bob
[1:00:26] wi whatever those barriers are there's
[1:00:30] there's great tanks there's uh marks on
[1:00:33] the ground because of the the missiles
[1:00:35] and the explosions and there's it's just
[1:00:39] a horrible
[1:00:40] sight it's a
[1:00:43] battle and and and brother Bram said
[1:00:46] that there's a battle going on today
[1:00:48] that's in the
[1:00:50] mind and it's it's that's why no matter
[1:00:54] how saved you are
[1:00:56] how secure you are in your soul the mind
[1:00:59] is always going to have to
[1:01:02] fight there's always going to be
[1:01:05] something going on in the mind always
[1:01:09] it's never as far as I know there's
[1:01:12] never going to be peace until we're
[1:01:15] changed until we go with the Lord
[1:01:18] because the devil has the rights to that
[1:01:21] mind and he'll go and he'll attack
[1:01:24] it and and um just like I said he chose
[1:01:28] it chose that mind and it created a
[1:01:31] battlefield and and you have to think
[1:01:33] about it kind of like in a in a
[1:01:35] different way that I'm sure he studied
[1:01:37] it I'm sure he knows just like people
[1:01:41] you know people will study the mind and
[1:01:44] what they'll do is they'll create social
[1:01:46] medias they'll create um casinos based
[1:01:50] on our human nature right so that it'll
[1:01:54] draw us to that
[1:01:56] if a man can do that imagine
[1:01:59] Satan imagine the things that he will do
[1:02:03] to cause us to fall The Avenues that
[1:02:06] he'll do so he he's he knows the human
[1:02:10] mind he knows our
[1:02:13] habits we they he had Google and uh
[1:02:18] YouTube have nothing on Satan you know I
[1:02:21] don't know if anybody has had a
[1:02:22] conversation about oh man you know um
[1:02:25] I've been thinking about a buying a boat
[1:02:26] and this this and that oh what kind oh
[1:02:28] bay liner and this you know you have a
[1:02:31] good nice conversation you know nobody
[1:02:32] else is there and then all of a sudden
[1:02:34] you go to Google or you go to YouTube
[1:02:36] and it's a nice Bayliner boat and you're
[1:02:39] like what what's going on government's
[1:02:41] hearing me or something who knows but I
[1:02:44] know people have experienced that before
[1:02:47] what about
[1:02:49] saying what about when we confess the
[1:02:52] wrong
[1:02:53] thing because our confession is a strong
[1:02:56] thing and what about whenever we go and
[1:02:58] we say we're unworthy or or we always
[1:03:01] seem to open up the wounds that never
[1:03:06] heal and we become victims and we create
[1:03:10] ourselves to be victims and the devil's
[1:03:12] saying yeah just keep saying that keep
[1:03:14] doing that I'm going to step on that
[1:03:16] wound I'm going to keep working on
[1:03:19] that it's that that power of the devil
[1:03:23] knowing what we confess and then he
[1:03:25] attacks those
[1:03:27] things um what's amazing is is he's
[1:03:31] attacking the mind but what does he
[1:03:34] want right that's what he wants he wants
[1:03:39] you because the mind if your soul is
[1:03:41] secure All Is Well with My Soul right
[1:03:45] All Is Well with My Soul he's wants the
[1:03:49] soul and amazing thing Jesus he talked
[1:03:53] about the eyes being the light of the
[1:03:55] body body people they'll say oh that's
[1:03:58] the window to the soul we've heard
[1:03:59] brother brandham talk about it we've
[1:04:00] heard other people say window to the
[1:04:02] soul and it's not just that we see
[1:04:05] something and it's a window to a soul
[1:04:07] but if you've ever heard of that
[1:04:08] scripture how it says um as a man looks
[1:04:12] upon a woman and lusts after her he's
[1:04:15] already committed adultery just by
[1:04:18] looking now he didn't say as a man
[1:04:21] lookth upon a woman he has already
[1:04:23] committed adultery that's the eyes right
[1:04:27] but there's something that happens with
[1:04:28] the eye it's a connection to our mind
[1:04:30] and our spirit where when we
[1:04:33] look like I said we all have thoughts
[1:04:37] every single
[1:04:38] day even brother Brown had a cross there
[1:04:42] in his in his uh in his car if a woman
[1:04:47] would walk by he'd look at the
[1:04:49] cross right we're
[1:04:51] humans we're humans but it's whenever we
[1:04:55] contemplate
[1:04:57] and we begin to allow those thoughts to
[1:04:59] sit there and to
[1:05:00] brew which is called lust and we look we
[1:05:05] lust committed
[1:05:07] adultery so it's it the the eyes and the
[1:05:10] mind they're associated with one another
[1:05:13] brother brandham says that the gate to
[1:05:15] the soul is the
[1:05:17] Mind said that in in spoken word is the
[1:05:20] original seed that the gate to the soul
[1:05:22] is the Mind wow he also said that the
[1:05:26] mind is the
[1:05:29] womb so it it our minds they're a
[1:05:32] fertile
[1:05:35] ground you know what I I I really like
[1:05:37] that
[1:05:39] um um whenever I I would speak and I
[1:05:43] would have an interpreter always it was
[1:05:45] in Spanish I would read certain
[1:05:47] scriptures there was a scripture in in
[1:05:49] Genesis that um I would I read there's
[1:05:53] other ones that I've read too like in
[1:05:54] Exodus where it would talk about the
[1:05:56] womb there was one I think I believe
[1:05:58] it's in
[1:06:00] Genesis um I can't find it but it's in
[1:06:02] Genesis 20 I believe 20 and 19 or 17 and
[1:06:05] it's talking about how um Abraham goes
[1:06:09] to this Kingdom there was a king named
[1:06:11] aimc and he sees
[1:06:13] Sarah and uh he wants to take her as a
[1:06:17] wife Abraham's like yeah that's my
[1:06:19] sister take her he was scared right what
[1:06:22] God
[1:06:23] did he he closed all the wounds of the
[1:06:27] women of the
[1:06:29] land and and and and so
[1:06:33] whenever everything changed and God said
[1:06:36] hey Abraham go and pray for ABC God went
[1:06:40] to AMC and he said hey you're doing the
[1:06:42] wrong thing you're a righteous man but
[1:06:44] if you don't um stop doing what you're
[1:06:47] doing you are going to be
[1:06:50] annihilated so of course he was a
[1:06:52] righteous man he he gave him back Sarah
[1:06:55] but Abraham prayed for him so that the
[1:06:58] wombs would open up from the
[1:07:01] women well that word in Spanish there's
[1:07:05] um a word called viente I I can't really
[1:07:07] say it right but then in in uh in King
[1:07:13] James version they it's called or reain
[1:07:16] of alera version It's called
[1:07:18] matrice it's a
[1:07:20] matrice right brother so if you ever
[1:07:23] read it in the Raina valeta version It's
[1:07:25] going to be called a matrice not a
[1:07:27] VI and um matrice in English now I don't
[1:07:33] this sounds funny but the word in
[1:07:35] English and the Hebrew if you go to the
[1:07:38] Hebrew it's actually called
[1:07:40] Matrix so matrice is Matrix in
[1:07:44] Spanish so um the reason why I say that
[1:07:47] because the womb is a
[1:07:50] matrix and and a matrix is a
[1:07:55] something that that is allowing
[1:07:58] something to form within
[1:08:00] itself it's a it's an atmosphere where
[1:08:04] something can grow and
[1:08:06] form so that's that's what a womb is or
[1:08:08] a matrix is something to allow it to
[1:08:12] grow and and brother bam said that our
[1:08:14] mind is a
[1:08:16] womb and we allow something to sit there
[1:08:19] we allow it to form and to
[1:08:23] grow right so so we allow these things
[1:08:27] if we allow a thought to come
[1:08:30] in if man you look at a woman you allow
[1:08:33] that thought to come in instead of ask
[1:08:35] for repentance or turn
[1:08:37] around you you form you begin to form
[1:08:41] something that's why the things that we
[1:08:43] watch you have to be careful yes sir the
[1:08:47] things that um were're seen on on on the
[1:08:50] phone and on the TV we have to watch out
[1:08:53] because if we watch it enough we become
[1:08:57] that right so uh this is um
[1:09:03] very very very strong stuff and it is
[1:09:06] saying that the mind is the gate to the
[1:09:10] soul so first just so I can paint the
[1:09:13] picture you have the Mind
[1:09:17] Battleground and in that mind there is a
[1:09:19] gate there and there's a fight there and
[1:09:23] there's a fight to get into that
[1:09:26] door there's a fight to get in there in
[1:09:29] in Revelations it talks about Jesus
[1:09:32] knocking at a door to a heart why he
[1:09:34] wants to get in so there's a door and
[1:09:37] guess who can open it the devil can't
[1:09:40] open it God can open it that's how God
[1:09:43] made us he gave us sovereignty within
[1:09:47] ourselves so that we can say hey I
[1:09:50] accept this thought or I reject this
[1:09:52] thought I accept the word or I reject
[1:09:55] the
[1:09:56] word it's up to us to open up that door
[1:10:01] that is in our
[1:10:02] mind and that door it says it's a door
[1:10:05] to your
[1:10:07] soul that's who you are this is I I've
[1:10:11] spoken about it before this is just
[1:10:13] flesh and
[1:10:14] blood but the real you is in
[1:10:17] here and and and and there's a battle
[1:10:20] for control there's a battle to to enter
[1:10:23] into that
[1:10:26] and the devil he don't want control so
[1:10:28] that he can make something prosperous he
[1:10:29] wants to wreck us and send us to
[1:10:32] Hell send us to the place he's
[1:10:35] going that's what he's trying to
[1:10:38] do God he made it for
[1:10:41] himself he made it for us um and I think
[1:10:46] about that and I think about like
[1:10:47] thoughts and and and you think about it
[1:10:49] you know we we look at the message we
[1:10:52] look at the word we look at the Bible
[1:10:54] and it show that in the beginning there
[1:10:56] was a beginning right and John he writes
[1:10:59] it perfectly it says in the beginning
[1:11:01] was the word and if you go to Genesis
[1:11:03] 1:1 it says in the beginning God
[1:11:06] created and so he spoke it was the word
[1:11:10] and that word created everything and
[1:11:14] that word actually created beginning of
[1:11:17] everything so before
[1:11:19] that it was a thought and that word
[1:11:23] expressed the thought wow
[1:11:25] so so and God thought for eternity he
[1:11:29] didn't think just for a little bit and
[1:11:31] it makes me realize that sometimes we
[1:11:33] have to think before we
[1:11:35] speak be
[1:11:38] because because look at what if God
[1:11:42] spoke rationally or irrationally if he
[1:11:46] spoke without
[1:11:48] thinking but everything he spoke he
[1:11:51] thought about it and whenever he began
[1:11:54] to speak
[1:11:55] from chaos came a Garden of Eden came
[1:12:01] Beauty came beautiful things and and a
[1:12:03] lot of times whenever we have to check
[1:12:07] our thoughts we have to check what we're
[1:12:09] thinking before we even speak yes that's
[1:12:12] good amen we have to know what we're
[1:12:15] thinking because sooner or later as a
[1:12:18] man thinketh in his heart so is
[1:12:20] he one of these days the things that we
[1:12:23] think we're going to manif it in our
[1:12:25] lives in our words in our what we
[1:12:29] do that's why sometimes we can't have
[1:12:31] the
[1:12:32] victory sometimes we we just don't know
[1:12:35] why we can't just kick that
[1:12:37] habit well we keep going to the same
[1:12:40] thoughts we keep allowing that same
[1:12:43] thing to enter into our mind and we open
[1:12:45] the door to
[1:12:46] it we let it sit
[1:12:50] there so uh there something that we we
[1:12:54] really we we have to watch it we have to
[1:12:57] be
[1:12:59] careful and
[1:13:02] um in Genesis 65 you don't have to turn
[1:13:05] with me but it says
[1:13:07] that that God saw that the wickedness of
[1:13:10] man was great in the earth and that
[1:13:12] every imagination of the thoughts of the
[1:13:15] heart was only evil
[1:13:18] continually so we we think you know we
[1:13:21] accidentally think wrong
[1:13:23] things we got got to kick it out but
[1:13:27] here God saw the wickedness of man and
[1:13:29] he saw that every
[1:13:32] imagination to imagine means you grab a
[1:13:35] thought and you make a world out of it
[1:13:38] right every imagination of the thoughts
[1:13:41] that Hebrew word is a Hebrew word called
[1:13:45] yer and means to form or to
[1:13:49] create it actually another word for it
[1:13:52] is figuratively is conception now we're
[1:13:55] talking about a womb here it's
[1:13:58] conception now the other time that this
[1:14:01] word is used it's another word called
[1:14:03] Yar which is basically the same and it's
[1:14:05] in Genesis 2:7 where it says and the
[1:14:08] Lord formed man
[1:14:11] formed so it was a creating process God
[1:14:15] Yar formed Man Out of the Dust of the
[1:14:17] earth and there was a man there and that
[1:14:20] same word is used when it says every
[1:14:23] imagination
[1:14:26] so we're forming something within our
[1:14:28] minds we're forming something every time
[1:14:31] we think every time we allow something
[1:14:33] to sit there is there is something
[1:14:35] growing within that
[1:14:37] Matrix growing within that
[1:14:41] womb until gives you give birth right
[1:14:45] and then we'll see the manifestation of
[1:14:47] it we'll see what's going on with that
[1:14:51] um so the womb in the mind is not just
[1:14:53] an analogy but but it's a spiritual
[1:14:57] womb it's a spiritual womb and and why
[1:15:02] did he create it it's a betting ground
[1:15:04] for
[1:15:05] him so that he can place his words in
[1:15:09] you and we accept the word and we become
[1:15:13] just like him that's why in in uh 2
[1:15:17] Corinthians it says when we look upon
[1:15:19] That Glory we become That
[1:15:21] Glory also I in I believe it's in
[1:15:25] Hebrews or in John 1 John it says that
[1:15:28] that one day we'll see Jesus and we'll
[1:15:32] be just like him so in seeing or or
[1:15:37] looking at the glory looking at the word
[1:15:39] we become that
[1:15:41] word we become formed our character is
[1:15:44] formed that's why we have to watch the
[1:15:46] things that we intake the things that we
[1:15:49] watch the things that we
[1:15:50] hear we allow in our mind because we'll
[1:15:54] become that very thing amen so that's
[1:15:58] why God created us we are a betting
[1:16:01] ground for his spoken word for his this
[1:16:04] word right here so every time you open
[1:16:08] up your Bible every time you you come
[1:16:10] here and listen to brother um Evans
[1:16:13] every time you come to church and
[1:16:15] worship you're you're creating and
[1:16:17] you're forming a
[1:16:19] character Church isn't to to save you we
[1:16:24] come here because I want to be more like
[1:16:27] him it's either this or I can sit in
[1:16:29] front of a TV it's either this or I can
[1:16:32] go out there with buddies and do
[1:16:34] whatever amen and what is that going to
[1:16:36] do to me
[1:16:38] amen what kind of investment is that
[1:16:40] going to give me I want to come here and
[1:16:44] I I I want to grow
[1:16:47] spiritually that's why we come that's
[1:16:49] why we were created the way we were
[1:16:51] created a as a seed so that God he can
[1:16:56] place his spirit in
[1:16:58] you and you can walk like him you can
[1:17:02] talk like him you can be like him you
[1:17:04] are the manifested
[1:17:07] word why because you you take it in you
[1:17:11] take it in until you become
[1:17:14] that so
[1:17:17] so we don't it it says that um there
[1:17:21] there's a scripture where it says that
[1:17:24] in Ephesians 612 says we for we wrestle
[1:17:27] not against flesh and blood but against
[1:17:30] principalities against Powers against
[1:17:32] rulers of dark uh rulers of Darkness of
[1:17:35] this world against spiritual weakness in
[1:17:38] high places we're struggling we we're
[1:17:42] fighting and um here let me see I don't
[1:17:46] know if I missed something
[1:17:49] here but so so there there's a fight
[1:17:52] going on in in in our body
[1:17:55] the Bible says that we are like a walled
[1:17:59] City so just to show you the picture
[1:18:02] again there's a Battleground in our mind
[1:18:05] and there's a door or there's a
[1:18:07] gate and the Bible here it says in
[1:18:10] Proverbs that he that is slow Proverbs
[1:18:13] 16:32 he that is slow to anger is better
[1:18:15] than the mighty he that ruleth his
[1:18:19] Spirit than he than that taketh a city
[1:18:23] and then here in Proverbs
[1:18:25] 25:28 it says that he that hath no rule
[1:18:29] over his own spirit is like a city that
[1:18:32] is broken down without
[1:18:36] walls so the picture in our mind is a
[1:18:39] Battleground and there's a
[1:18:42] gate and and you are a walled
[1:18:46] City brother brandham said that that
[1:18:49] wall or that fortification is the
[1:18:51] word you you Build That Wall by what the
[1:18:55] things that you take in that's why we
[1:18:58] can build walls against one another
[1:19:00] they're called complexes right we can
[1:19:03] build fortifications around ourselves
[1:19:06] that person's not going to hurt me again
[1:19:09] I'm not going to go through that if they
[1:19:12] they do that I'll never speak to them
[1:19:14] again what what do that's a
[1:19:17] wall but when we take the word that
[1:19:20] becomes a
[1:19:22] wall and the only way to infiltrate or
[1:19:25] to get into that wall is to open the
[1:19:28] door and that's your free will that's
[1:19:32] you allowing whatever to come in and to
[1:19:34] come go out I remember the the Pharisees
[1:19:38] they asked well um they says when is the
[1:19:41] kingdom of God um when should it come
[1:19:44] Luke 17:20 and
[1:19:47] 21 and he answered them he says the
[1:19:49] kingdom of God cometh not with
[1:19:52] observation verse 21 he says neither
[1:19:55] shall they say Lo here loow there where
[1:19:59] is the kingdom what church is it what
[1:20:03] denomination what belief system where is
[1:20:06] the kingdom is it is it a special kind
[1:20:09] of
[1:20:10] people is it a special kind of race
[1:20:13] where's the kingdom he says neither they
[1:20:16] shal say Lo here or low there for behold
[1:20:20] the kingdom of God is within you
[1:20:24] so now we see the picture when you
[1:20:27] accept Christ there is a kingdom within
[1:20:31] you and you're fortified that that City
[1:20:35] or that Kingdom with the wall of the
[1:20:37] word and the only way to get into that
[1:20:41] Kingdom into your soul is
[1:20:44] allowing somebody to come in by opening
[1:20:47] that gate but outside of that Kingdom
[1:20:50] there is a battle going on day in and
[1:20:53] day out amen for
[1:20:56] AIS there's a battle every single day to
[1:21:01] get to who you really are to get control
[1:21:04] to possess everything that you
[1:21:08] are to possess your
[1:21:11] happiness to possess your peace of
[1:21:14] mind see the devil let him burn
[1:21:17] everything
[1:21:19] down let them hurt my
[1:21:22] body let them turn people against me
[1:21:26] right let them even mess my mind up my
[1:21:30] soul is
[1:21:32] secure why you're fortified am so we're
[1:21:36] wrestling against that and every single
[1:21:39] day there's a turmoil and there's a
[1:21:41] fight over that City it's not a your
[1:21:44] this kingdom is not a democratic Kingdom
[1:21:47] it's a kingdom it's not a democracy
[1:21:50] where oh well let's have two opinions no
[1:21:52] there's no opinion only
[1:21:55] one there's only one king that can live
[1:21:58] in this Kingdom and that is Christ
[1:22:02] Jesus only Christ
[1:22:05] Jesus it it's it's not something where
[1:22:08] we can talk about we can reason when you
[1:22:11] allow another king to come in you cannot
[1:22:13] serve God and Mammon at the same time
[1:22:16] you cannot serve God and the devil amen
[1:22:19] once the devil enters in he's got
[1:22:22] control what hases he got control over
[1:22:24] he's got control of your conscience he's
[1:22:27] got control of your memory he's got
[1:22:29] control of your emotions he's got
[1:22:31] control of everything and he can just
[1:22:34] move it the way he wants to he's in the
[1:22:36] control room
[1:22:38] now and and and and we are are sold
[1:22:42] under
[1:22:44] that but when we allow Christ to come in
[1:22:47] we fortify all the walls we make sure
[1:22:51] everything is good the devil can't come
[1:22:54] in
[1:22:55] doesn't matter and and we're not
[1:22:57] wrestling against one another well that
[1:23:00] sister told me this that brother he
[1:23:02] looked at me wrong doesn't
[1:23:04] matter doesn't matter I don't fight
[1:23:06] against flesh and
[1:23:08] blood I I'm fighting I'm fighting
[1:23:11] against these
[1:23:12] Spirits I'm I'm fighting against
[1:23:16] thoughts every High thing what does that
[1:23:18] scripture I wish I could say it right
[1:23:20] but but it says cast down every High
[1:23:23] thought every evil
[1:23:26] imagination everything every imagination
[1:23:29] that exalts itself higher than God cast
[1:23:32] it down don't even let it sit because
[1:23:36] once we let a thought sit then we will
[1:23:41] the Bible says that this word
[1:23:43] imagination means
[1:23:46] conception we allow it to be
[1:23:50] conceived we allow it to grow to a point
[1:23:54] to to where it's going to you're going
[1:23:55] to give
[1:23:57] birth you're going to it it's going to
[1:24:00] come out of your life and you're going
[1:24:01] to say how how did I allow this to
[1:24:05] happen see the devil what he's going to
[1:24:08] do he's he's going to hurt you at your
[1:24:11] work he's not going to let you
[1:24:14] sleep you try to you try to go to sleep
[1:24:17] and you wake up Tire more tired than you
[1:24:19] did when you fell asleep wow he he he
[1:24:22] will attack your home
[1:24:25] he will attack your
[1:24:27] body he will attack everything but he
[1:24:31] doesn't want
[1:24:33] that he doesn't want your
[1:24:36] house he doesn't want your even your
[1:24:39] flesh he wants
[1:24:42] you he's fighting every moment and every
[1:24:47] inch of ground if he can gain as much as
[1:24:50] he can he will wow why because he wants
[1:24:54] wants you he wants you he wants to wreck
[1:24:58] your
[1:25:00] life but when we accept
[1:25:03] Christ we accept the blood we accept
[1:25:07] what he says about
[1:25:09] us and all of that then we can accept
[1:25:13] his
[1:25:16] spirit let rain come let Sun come let
[1:25:20] everything come it doesn't
[1:25:22] matter let this body
[1:25:24] crumble I know where I'm
[1:25:27] standing I can still sing this song well
[1:25:30] brother you're going through this well
[1:25:32] didn't your family do this well aren't
[1:25:34] don't you have this cancer don't you
[1:25:36] have that all is well with my
[1:25:40] soul why cuz I I have an anchor in here
[1:25:43] I met the master thank God I've met
[1:25:46] Christ amen All Is Well with My Soul
[1:25:50] well you're dying you're in your death
[1:25:51] bread All Is Well with My Soul
[1:25:55] that's the life I want to live I I I
[1:25:58] prosperous out there doesn't matter if
[1:26:00] the devil has my
[1:26:02] soul if the devil can control and send
[1:26:05] me to the place that was designed for
[1:26:08] him I don't want any of
[1:26:10] that I I want a place to where if it's
[1:26:14] going to be
[1:26:16] heartaches or if it's whatever it's
[1:26:18] going to be but I can be secure in
[1:26:20] Christ
[1:26:21] Jesus standing in his word amen and we
[1:26:25] have to realize that if your gate is
[1:26:28] closed your mind is closed it doesn't
[1:26:31] matter how much the devil hits you he's
[1:26:36] harmless he's the B brother Brown
[1:26:38] actually said he's almost harmless if he
[1:26:41] doesn't have a body to go into yeah so
[1:26:44] even though it
[1:26:46] seems even though it seems like oh man
[1:26:49] it's just I'm going through it it's hard
[1:26:52] he doesn't have power over you am he
[1:26:55] does not have power over you until we
[1:26:57] accept the words he has for us Jesus
[1:27:01] there was one time where he says my SP
[1:27:03] my words are spirit and they are
[1:27:06] life so the words that he speaks there's
[1:27:09] a spirit behind
[1:27:11] it and every time we hear his word
[1:27:14] preached behind this Pulpit reading the
[1:27:18] Bible listening on your phone or
[1:27:21] wherever you
[1:27:22] are you are in taking a spirit you're
[1:27:26] receiving
[1:27:28] Spirits which if it's the word you're
[1:27:31] receiving
[1:27:32] him but when we allow the bad thoughts
[1:27:36] intrusive thoughts people to say things
[1:27:38] and you accept those things well we're
[1:27:41] we're going to be in a horrible
[1:27:44] condition I I'm I I think I've said it
[1:27:46] before here but how how brother brandham
[1:27:49] he discerned that woman he realized that
[1:27:52] she had a spirit over her and he said
[1:27:54] why because there was a lie that was
[1:27:55] told over her that she was a
[1:27:58] witch there was a lie there was words
[1:28:01] and she accepted it she wasn't a witch
[1:28:04] but yet the spirit was over
[1:28:07] her now now my question is what do we
[1:28:11] think not only that what do we say about
[1:28:13] one
[1:28:14] another what do we say about ourselves
[1:28:18] brother what do we say about our
[1:28:20] family what kind of spirits are we
[1:28:23] letting out
[1:28:24] what kind of things because the Bible
[1:28:26] says that that we have a high
[1:28:30] priest that that is waiting for our
[1:28:32] profession or
[1:28:34] confession so every time we confess
[1:28:37] every time we speak the word or we say
[1:28:39] what he says there's a high priest or a
[1:28:42] spirit that goes forth and begins to
[1:28:46] work on your
[1:28:48] confession and then there's a scripture
[1:28:50] that says the death and life are at the
[1:28:53] power of the tongue
[1:28:55] so sometimes we don't have the right
[1:28:59] confession sometimes we don't have the
[1:29:01] right words and we and there's either
[1:29:03] going to be life coming out or there's
[1:29:05] going to be death coming
[1:29:08] out and let me tell you what there's a
[1:29:10] lot of betting
[1:29:12] grounds that are there to receive it and
[1:29:15] what do we do we re destroy one
[1:29:18] another we destroy ourselves when we
[1:29:21] because we as a betting ground we
[1:29:23] receive those
[1:29:25] things and then we manifest those things
[1:29:29] so we ha we have to we have to be
[1:29:32] careful and what the devil wants to do
[1:29:34] just like the Bible says th those people
[1:29:36] that don't have a rule over their spirit
[1:29:38] is like a city Without
[1:29:40] Walls when when the Devil comes
[1:29:43] in we've seen it many times maybe
[1:29:46] somebody experienced it in their
[1:29:49] lives when the Devil comes in he'll tear
[1:29:52] everything down
[1:29:54] he'll tear everything about God
[1:29:57] down he'll cause us to be angry at the
[1:30:00] very God that loves
[1:30:02] us he'll tear tear the word down tear
[1:30:06] everything down and create his own
[1:30:07] kingdom within
[1:30:11] us till we are
[1:30:14] helpless like I said till we begin to
[1:30:17] create different walls there was the
[1:30:20] word now we begin to create walls of
[1:30:24] complexes walls of
[1:30:26] anger walls of
[1:30:28] depression things that people they
[1:30:31] cannot penetrate people cannot they
[1:30:33] cannot even get close to us no more why
[1:30:36] because we have reserved ourselves so
[1:30:38] much and we're in such a mess yet when
[1:30:41] everybody sees us we have a nice little
[1:30:43] smile we look happy we look good but
[1:30:47] there's a termoil going on why we're
[1:30:51] we've allowed the devil to to ravish
[1:30:55] this
[1:30:56] Kingdom we've allowed the devil to enter
[1:30:59] in and take control of our emotions and
[1:31:02] take control of the things that that we
[1:31:05] hold
[1:31:06] dearly we're so we're so adamant of of
[1:31:10] saying hey don't drink don't smoke but
[1:31:12] but what are the things that we're
[1:31:14] intaking in
[1:31:16] spiritually what are the things we're
[1:31:18] allowing come through our mind and we're
[1:31:20] just we don't
[1:31:21] care and we don't know why we're in such
[1:31:23] such a mess why there's somebody sitting
[1:31:26] at that control tower that shouldn't be
[1:31:29] there and now we have Christ knocking at
[1:31:33] the
[1:31:34] door if anyone answers if anybody opens
[1:31:38] the door I can clean up I can clean up
[1:31:42] the
[1:31:44] house I I can I can remodel I can help
[1:31:49] you sometimes we find ourselves in that
[1:31:52] condition where where we're all messed
[1:31:54] up in our mind and everything yet we try
[1:31:56] to keep it together we try to look like
[1:31:59] Christians we try to look like Sayan
[1:32:03] people but we don't need to try to try
[1:32:07] anything we need
[1:32:10] Christ how do you open the how do you
[1:32:12] how do you let him in open the
[1:32:15] door all you do the only Power that you
[1:32:20] give Satan or God is to open to accept
[1:32:25] and many times we've accept too much
[1:32:27] trash in our
[1:32:29] lives we accept too much doubt accept
[1:32:32] too much
[1:32:34] things to we're all messed up but accept
[1:32:39] Jesus see what
[1:32:41] happens well my my finances didn't
[1:32:44] change my family is still the same but
[1:32:46] how's your
[1:32:48] soul how's that it says first seek ye
[1:32:51] the kingdom
[1:32:54] everything else will be added on first
[1:32:57] seek the kingdom don't worry don't try
[1:32:59] to fix yourself don't try to dress like
[1:33:01] a Christian don't try to act all nice
[1:33:04] that's all
[1:33:07] hypocrisy seek ye the kingdom
[1:33:10] first Let Jesus enter in and change that
[1:33:15] Kingdom change that world that's inside
[1:33:17] of you then you don't have to try to act
[1:33:21] you don't have to try to be it just
[1:33:24] comes
[1:33:25] out sometimes you you have a little
[1:33:28] Character
[1:33:29] defects as long as I filled with the
[1:33:32] Holy Ghost and God guides me I'm going
[1:33:34] to be who I am that's who God wants us
[1:33:37] to be be who we
[1:33:39] are and God will fix all those little
[1:33:42] defects all those little things it's not
[1:33:45] a restraining it's not an arresting of
[1:33:47] trying to do something that's what the
[1:33:49] law tried to do and it failed and it
[1:33:52] wasn't that the law failed but we had
[1:33:55] the wrong Spirit to even accept that law
[1:33:58] that perfect law so you had
[1:34:01] a bad nature trying to accept a perfect
[1:34:05] principles of God it'll never work it'll
[1:34:09] never work trying to come to church and
[1:34:11] trying to be this or trying to be that
[1:34:13] it'll never
[1:34:14] work we need Jesus first we need his
[1:34:19] Spirit God is so good cuz he will give
[1:34:22] you that spirit amen
[1:34:24] we've heard it many times he's more
[1:34:26] willing to give it to you than we are to
[1:34:28] receive
[1:34:29] it maybe because we have a wall of doubt
[1:34:33] we got to break it
[1:34:34] down the Bible it
[1:34:37] says second Corinthians as I'm closing
[1:34:40] very um quick message but 2 Corinthians
[1:34:44] 104-5 it says for the weapons of our
[1:34:47] Warfare they're not
[1:34:49] carnal dressing like a Christian don't
[1:34:52] make you a Christian on
[1:34:54] coming to church don't make don't save
[1:34:57] you so what is it they're Mighty through
[1:35:01] God pulling down of strongholds a
[1:35:04] stronghold can be either two things it
[1:35:07] could be a
[1:35:08] fortress or it could be walls that
[1:35:10] you're imprisoned
[1:35:12] in and here it's talking about
[1:35:15] strongholds that that that have wrapped
[1:35:17] around your
[1:35:18] mind and the only way you can break
[1:35:21] those is not carnally is not trying to
[1:35:24] be but it's only through God then you
[1:35:29] begin to break down those walls that say
[1:35:32] tries to put up in your
[1:35:34] mind casting down
[1:35:37] imaginations cast every single thing
[1:35:40] every habit everything that that is is
[1:35:43] binding you cast it
[1:35:46] away and every High thing that exalts
[1:35:49] itself against the knowledge of God and
[1:35:52] bringing into captivity ity every
[1:35:55] thought to The Obedience of
[1:35:57] Christ you can win this war there's
[1:36:01] always going to be a battle out there in
[1:36:03] your mind but as a thought comes Let It
[1:36:07] Go an evil thought comes don't feel
[1:36:11] guilty that it came just cast it out say
[1:36:16] that's not even mine I don't want that I
[1:36:18] don't accept those
[1:36:21] thoughts that's something that that it
[1:36:25] needs to be instilled in us
[1:36:29] today we see too many people in
[1:36:33] depression too many people stuck in
[1:36:36] their own
[1:36:38] mind to the point where somebody wants
[1:36:40] to end their
[1:36:42] life why because they could not get out
[1:36:46] of the thoughts that they had there was
[1:36:49] no way out there was a stronghold
[1:36:53] but brothers sisters Jesus paved the way
[1:36:57] for
[1:36:58] us he made a way so that we can be
[1:37:02] free and though everything that attacks
[1:37:06] us it doesn't matter because we are
[1:37:08] secure safe hid in
[1:37:12] Christ as long as you're hid in Christ
[1:37:15] the devil say ah you're not
[1:37:16] saved I'm not going to even acknowledge
[1:37:19] that thought oh well this or that oh
[1:37:22] well look at your family family well
[1:37:24] look at your condition look at where
[1:37:26] you're at I don't care what the devil
[1:37:29] says I don't care what what any thought
[1:37:32] that is contrary to his word I cast it
[1:37:36] out every thought that tries to put
[1:37:38] itself before God I cast it
[1:37:42] out get every thought and it says bring
[1:37:46] it into the Captivity every thought to
[1:37:49] The Obedience of Christ take it to
[1:37:52] Christ some something you have a doubt
[1:37:54] on something that you're struggling take
[1:37:57] it to Christ and he'll take control over
[1:37:59] it let us stand to our feet as the
[1:38:02] musicians would like to come up as we
[1:38:04] pray give this service to brother

[1:43:34] morning it's a question is it
[1:43:38] well with the souls that are here this
[1:43:42] morning is your relationship with Christ
[1:43:45] is it
[1:43:46] well I love what our brother said do you
[1:43:50] appreciate our brother Eli
[1:43:57] oh what he said about what he said about
[1:43:59] God and about how that womb is
[1:44:03] there and in the negative side that we
[1:44:05] can allow this in and it starts to grow
[1:44:09] in this womb and eventually it gives
[1:44:11] birth and it gives birth to sin it gives
[1:44:14] birth to doubt it gives gives birth to
[1:44:16] awful
[1:44:17] things but then brothers and sisters
[1:44:20] there was something before before the
[1:44:22] found foundation of the world I was in
[1:44:25] his
[1:44:26] thoughts I was in the thoughts of God
[1:44:29] you were in the thoughts of God and then
[1:44:33] eventually in the and the world was in
[1:44:35] the thoughts of God and the universe was
[1:44:37] in the thoughts of God and then there
[1:44:38] was a day he said let there be light and
[1:44:41] there was light and it was manifested
[1:44:44] those thoughts were manifested and then
[1:44:46] there was a
[1:44:47] time when me when I came to the Lord wow
[1:44:53] and I was in his thoughts and I was in
[1:44:54] God but there was a time when he said
[1:44:57] let there be life come from this this
[1:45:01] man or this boy or this woman or this
[1:45:04] girl and then it was
[1:45:05] manifested and it came
[1:45:08] forward and it can be here today
[1:45:11] brothers and sisters this could be the
[1:45:15] day that that womb gives
[1:45:19] birth to a son or a daughter of God
[1:45:24] that it becomes
[1:45:27] real don't let the negatives come in to
[1:45:31] that womb of your heart as our brother
[1:45:34] said God chose the heart Satan chose the
[1:45:39] mind and this battle going on in our
[1:45:42] mind but there is something over on the
[1:45:44] other side that Lord I am in you I am I
[1:45:47] am one of of God's children let it come
[1:45:51] forth
[1:45:53] let life come
[1:45:57] forth if you
[1:45:59] have on your heart to be
[1:46:02] baptized today is a good day to do it
[1:46:05] don't let it
[1:46:06] pass do you need to be baptized to be
[1:46:09] saved
[1:46:11] no do you need to be baptized the the
[1:46:14] thief on the cross wasn't baptized and
[1:46:16] he was saved do you need to be baptized
[1:46:19] to receive the Holy Ghost no Cornelius
[1:46:22] received the Holy Holy Ghost before he
[1:46:23] was
[1:46:25] baptized but do you need to be baptized
[1:46:29] to be a disciple of Jesus
[1:46:32] Christ to make that decision Lord I want
[1:46:35] to serve you I want to represent you
[1:46:39] here on Earth do you need to be baptized
[1:46:41] in that for that yes and that's where
[1:46:44] there is a name associated with
[1:46:48] baptism it's not it's not baptized in
[1:46:51] titles there is a name a associated with
[1:46:53] this because it represents Christ it
[1:46:57] represents Jesus that's why we are
[1:46:59] baptized in Jesus name Lord I want to be
[1:47:02] your disciple here on Earth I want to
[1:47:05] represent you here on Earth and that's
[1:47:08] why I want to make this decision to be
[1:47:12] baptized Romans chapter 6 it says
[1:47:17] this it says what shall we say
[1:47:20] then shall we continue you in sin that
[1:47:23] Grace May
[1:47:25] abound as our brother was saying here
[1:47:28] this
[1:47:29] morning the thing the that that our
[1:47:31] minds can can Harbor all of this
[1:47:35] sin but shall we continue in this sin
[1:47:38] that that Grace May abound we know the
[1:47:40] Lord is
[1:47:42] there no God
[1:47:46] forbid how shall we that are dead to sin
[1:47:51] live any longer therein
[1:47:53] therefore we are buried with
[1:47:58] him by
[1:48:00] baptism into
[1:48:02] death we are buried with Christ Christ
[1:48:06] was Christ died on the cross he was put
[1:48:10] in the
[1:48:11] Tomb therefore we go to the Waters of
[1:48:14] baptism say Lord here I am I am dying to
[1:48:17] myself I am going to go into these
[1:48:20] Waters like you went into to the tomb
[1:48:24] and then I'm going to raise
[1:48:26] again and it represents the death burial
[1:48:30] and resurrection of our Lord Jesus
[1:48:33] therefore we are buried with him by
[1:48:35] baptism into death that like as Christ
[1:48:37] who is raised up from the dead by the
[1:48:39] glory of the father even so we also
[1:48:42] should walk in newness of life that is
[1:48:46] baptism now I am a disciple of Christ in
[1:48:49] front of everyone here I am making this
[1:48:52] decision I want to be baptized I want a
[1:48:54] change in my life I want a renewal of
[1:48:56] the spirit Here I Am Lord and I want to
[1:49:00] be baptized in your
[1:49:04] name not in the
[1:49:06] titles I want to be I want my
[1:49:10] name Daniel
[1:49:12] Evans associated with Jesus Christ on
[1:49:16] that day and on this day I am associated
[1:49:20] with Jesus Christ today
[1:49:23] who else here is associated with Jesus
[1:49:25] Christ I hope every name every hand is
[1:49:28] up I am with him I am with Jesus Christ
[1:49:32] if you can take your
[1:49:35] seats brothers and sisters if there
[1:49:39] is a desire in your heart to be baptized
[1:49:44] if you want to make a decision today now
[1:49:47] is a good time to do it as I said do you
[1:49:52] have to be baptized to be saved no
[1:49:54] that's not
[1:49:55] scriptural do you have to be baptized to
[1:49:58] receive the Holy Ghost that's not
[1:49:59] scriptural either but you do need to be
[1:50:03] baptized to be part of Jesus Christ here
[1:50:07] on Earth you have to make that decision
[1:50:10] saying Lord here I
[1:50:12] am I'm your son and I take on the name
[1:50:17] of the son of God and I represent him as
[1:50:20] a disciple of Jesus Christ if the
[1:50:23] sisters sister uh sister Gara if you
[1:50:25] would go to the back and the sisters
[1:50:28] we're going to we're going to have to go
[1:50:29] to our baptism a little bit different
[1:50:31] because of the construction if the
[1:50:33] sisters would meet sister Gara here in
[1:50:35] the back of the building and if there
[1:50:37] are any brothers brother Ed if you would
[1:50:39] come come forward and stand here if
[1:50:41] there's any brothers that want to be
[1:50:43] baptized we can uh come right through
[1:50:46] here and then we will go up to the to
[1:50:48] the
[1:50:49] baptismal it's a good time it's a a good
[1:50:52] time to be baptized after that message
[1:50:54] oh it was I was I couldn't write and my
[1:50:57] pen ran out of
[1:50:59] ink Couldn't Write fast
[1:51:02] enough I pray that the Lord without what
[1:51:05] our brother said I don't have to write
[1:51:07] it down I pray that it's written on my
