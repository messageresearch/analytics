[9:17] would like to give praise to God about
[9:19] two weeks ago I was going through a hard
[9:21] trial and was asking God to help me
[9:24] through the trial at the same time I was
[9:27] praying at the same time I was praying
[9:30] God showed someone what I was going

[9:36] helped me through the trial God is so
[9:38] good I can't praise him enough I also

[9:47] thank God for Christians that he can use
[9:50] when we are in need brothers and sisters
[9:53] we are a
[9:54] body that body is knit together and
[9:58] there are different parts of that body
[10:02] and each part is vitally important
[10:06] brother Jeremy was running around and he
[10:08] and he hid his his knee and his finger
[10:13] and all of a sudden that knee and that
[10:15] finger became the most important part of
[10:17] his body because it was in pain 1
[10:20] Corinthians 12: 26 says when one member
[10:24] of the body suffers the entire body
[10:28] suffers
[10:29] and that's with sister Shirley she's
[10:31] giving praise that that the Lord used
[10:33] somebody else to help her and reveal
[10:37] that to that person at that same time
[10:39] that she was suffering and then they
[10:42] were able to pray about these things and
[10:46] worked it out amen doesn't it feel good
[10:50] to be in this battle with other

[1:00:50] that you would also be with us tonight
[1:00:53] in Jesus name amen you can take your
[1:00:58] seats bu can I have that
[1:01:03] M there's
[1:01:06] something there is
[1:01:09] just there's something about praising
[1:01:12] the
[1:01:13] Lord that there there's really there's
[1:01:15] nothing like it we can we can preach the
[1:01:19] gospel
[1:01:20] and you can you can learn something but
[1:01:24] then there is a time also for worship
[1:01:28] and the lord loves to be worshiped and
[1:01:31] he loves to be worshiped through song
[1:01:33] and praise and and I mentioned this last
[1:01:37] night at our meeting and it's very
[1:01:39] important when we are listening to
[1:01:45] music whether it be in our car and our
[1:01:48] at home and our earbuds wherever it
[1:01:50] might be music was designed to worship
[1:01:56] and as you are listening to to the music
[1:01:59] that you're listening to or you're
[1:02:00] singing along you are worshiping and I
[1:02:02] ask you what are you
[1:02:05] worshiping as you're listening to the
[1:02:08] music and singing
[1:02:10] along the Lord has given us music and
[1:02:14] the devil so often he has taken music
[1:02:17] and he perverts
[1:02:19] it and he turns it into something that
[1:02:22] worships him and looks at him so
[1:02:26] brothers and
[1:02:27] sisters
[1:02:30] music is is vitally vitally important I
[1:02:34] gave that I talked about that last night
[1:02:38] and we had some visitors and uh there
[1:02:42] was there was three uh Mormon
[1:02:44] missionaries that were there and after
[1:02:49] our
[1:02:51] service they they wanted to talk and and
[1:02:53] we had a really nice conversation
[1:02:57] and uh the one that was kind of the
[1:02:58] leader in the group he said hey I wanted
[1:03:01] to tell you what you said about worship
[1:03:05] and about listening to
[1:03:08] music he said uh he said sir he said I
[1:03:13] fall short there he says I never thought
[1:03:16] about that and then both of the other
[1:03:18] ones these are good boys both of the
[1:03:21] other ones said the same thing I know I
[1:03:23] know I do too
[1:03:25] and we had it started a really nice
[1:03:28] conversation with them and I told them
[1:03:31] they they said well why are you why are
[1:03:34] you here what's your story and I gave a
[1:03:37] little bit of of my history and I said
[1:03:40] you know I said one of the biggest
[1:03:41] things with
[1:03:43] me was that I
[1:03:46] saw that there was many times preaching
[1:03:52] a narrative or preaching a what a church
[1:03:57] thinks rather than genuinely seeking God
[1:04:01] and
[1:04:02] seeking what he
[1:04:04] wants instead of just preaching what my
[1:04:07] church says or or what a certain book
[1:04:10] says but Lord what do you have for me to
[1:04:13] do what is right in my life and what
[1:04:16] would you like me to say and I said
[1:04:19] that's the reason I said I got I got
[1:04:21] really
[1:04:23] discouraged and as I was talking I knew
[1:04:26] who I was talking to as I was talking to
[1:04:29] these young
[1:04:30] men one of them he bowed his head and I
[1:04:35] could see that it was starting to get
[1:04:39] through and he knew what I was talking
[1:04:41] about the one he was like oh yeah yeah
[1:04:44] that's that's good and the other one
[1:04:46] took what I was saying and he applied it
[1:04:50] to his own
[1:04:51] life and he and he stopped talking
[1:04:57] and the other two would
[1:04:59] talk and this young man he he wouldn't
[1:05:01] he wouldn't say anything
[1:05:03] else and I could I could see
[1:05:06] that he applied this to the LDS church
[1:05:12] and how they are going
[1:05:15] out not necessarily to win
[1:05:18] souls but to win
[1:05:21] converts to their
[1:05:23] church and brothers and sisters we need
[1:05:25] to be careful that we are not doing the
[1:05:26] same
[1:05:27] thing we are not trying to win a convert
[1:05:31] to the Tucson Tabernacle or to anything
[1:05:34] else what we are trying to do is
[1:05:36] introduce someone to the Lord Jesus
[1:05:40] Christ that is the most important thing
[1:05:44] it's in every Epistle of the New
[1:05:48] Testament everyone without without
[1:05:51] exception that is the motive behind them
[1:05:55] and if if we truly have the Holy Spirit
[1:05:57] of God that is what we are going to
[1:06:00] do and many times that
[1:06:05] witness can come through just
[1:06:08] worship just songs sister Rachel I I
[1:06:11] heard secondhand a testimony that you
[1:06:14] gave how you had something on your heart
[1:06:17] was it you and then brother Josiah sang
[1:06:20] the song and it gave you the
[1:06:23] answer if that's true raise your hand
[1:06:27] it was a
[1:06:28] song didn't necessarily have to be the
[1:06:31] minister up here reading the Bible and
[1:06:33] breaking down the Scriptures it was
[1:06:35] music it was praise it was it was
[1:06:38] adoration to the Lord Jesus and it gave
[1:06:41] an answer we should always have such
[1:06:45] high expectation of what the Lord can do
[1:06:48] in a worship service come expecting it's
[1:06:52] not just oh this person I like this
[1:06:53] person singing or or I like the way that
[1:06:56] this sister plays the piano or the
[1:06:57] brother on the guitar or whatever it is
[1:06:59] no I want to come and I Lord I Want To
[1:07:01] Praise You I Want To Worship you and
[1:07:04] that was what our meeting was about last
[1:07:07] night that Lord we just want to praise
[1:07:11] you we can set aside any differences or
[1:07:14] any doctrines they don't matter
[1:07:16] anyways what matters is that we know our
[1:07:20] Lord and we know our Savior Jesus
[1:07:23] Christ there's a story
[1:07:27] about a king in the Bible his name is
[1:07:33] Jehoshaphat and we all know the famous
[1:07:35] story of Jehoshaphat and
[1:07:38] Ahab and Ahab brought 400
[1:07:42] prophets to Jehoshaphat he asked he said
[1:07:45] have you josaphat asked him he said
[1:07:47] would you like to go to war with us and
[1:07:49] and or Ahab asked josph that and josph
[1:07:52] had respond and said hey we're brothers
[1:07:54] I'm Jud
[1:07:56] and you're Israel we were once perfectly
[1:07:58] together we're still Brothers yes but
[1:08:01] let's seek the Lord's will on
[1:08:05] this and Ahab says I have 400 men of God
[1:08:10] prophets of god let's bring them down
[1:08:12] there and they were all in one Accord
[1:08:14] but there was something about this man
[1:08:16] Jehoshaphat it's it didn't seem quite
[1:08:18] right he says don't you have just one
[1:08:21] more and then there was mcka
[1:08:27] mcka J Ahab hated
[1:08:31] him and he
[1:08:34] said go on up go to battle but if you
[1:08:38] return at all God didn't speak to
[1:08:40] me prophesied of the death of this
[1:08:43] King and I always
[1:08:46] wondered they went to battle I always
[1:08:49] wondered why did josa
[1:08:51] go why did he why did he go and fight
[1:08:53] with this man Ahab
[1:08:56] and they went to battle and you know the
[1:08:57] story Ahab got killed in the
[1:09:00] battle he was shot an Archer just pulls
[1:09:03] up and shoots wasn't even aiming at
[1:09:06] anything and there Arrow comes down and
[1:09:08] goes in between a and ahab's armor
[1:09:12] and kills
[1:09:14] him I always wondered why did he go to
[1:09:17] battle but maybe the question is why
[1:09:19] didn't I read the next chapter
[1:09:25] the Bible's
[1:09:27] wonderful so what happened
[1:09:29] was josaphat went back home went back
[1:09:33] came back home safely got out of the
[1:09:36] battle and he probably thought he was
[1:09:38] doing pretty good and then a prophet
[1:09:41] came to
[1:09:44] Jehoshaphat and he says something very
[1:09:46] strange to him he
[1:09:47] says he says should you help the ungodly
[1:09:51] and love them that hate the Lord
[1:09:54] therefore is right wrath upon thee from
[1:09:56] before the
[1:09:59] Lord 2 Chronicles chapter 19 says
[1:10:03] that so then Jehoshaphat he gets this
[1:10:05] word from this prophet and he says we
[1:10:08] got to do something about this so he
[1:10:10] goes and he starts what we would call in
[1:10:13] today's in today's U vernacular in
[1:10:16] today's language he goes and he starts
[1:10:19] preaching the gospel across Judah and he
[1:10:22] starts encouraging the people to get
[1:10:24] closer to the Lord come out of the world
[1:10:26] get closer to the Lord and and let's
[1:10:28] let's put our lives behind
[1:10:34] God loving the
[1:10:36] Lord
[1:10:39] then after he did
[1:10:43] that he hears
[1:10:46] word that there were armies forming
[1:10:48] against him and against Judah these were
[1:10:51] not just armies these were
[1:10:54] overwhelmingly powerful armies and
[1:10:57] there's no way that Judah could ever
[1:10:59] survive
[1:11:01] this Jehoshaphat doesn't know what to
[1:11:05] do and he says to the people he says
[1:11:07] fast and pray he says brothers and
[1:11:10] sisters we are about to lose our kingdom
[1:11:12] we're about to lose our homes this Army
[1:11:15] that is is coming out of inti brother Li
[1:11:18] I believe it's it's uh it's southeast of
[1:11:22] Jerusalem this Army that's forming down
[1:11:24] there is is massive and it's going to
[1:11:27] come against us and we have nothing to
[1:11:29] do we need
[1:11:33] God people start praying and then a very
[1:11:38] unlikely Source gave a prophecy from
[1:11:43] god let's turn to 2
[1:11:48] Chronicles chapter 20 verse
[1:11:53] 15 in this man that gave the prophecy it
[1:11:57] wasn't a king it wasn't the prophet that
[1:12:00] had just spoken this man named
[1:12:03] juu this was a different man you know
[1:12:05] who it was it was a song
[1:12:08] leader it was a worship
[1:12:11] leader that gave this prophecy this was
[1:12:13] a man who was filled with the holy
[1:12:15] spirit that loved the
[1:12:18] Lord and then God came down through this
[1:12:21] worship leader and says these words
[1:12:28] 2 Chronicles chapter 20 we'll start with
[1:12:30] verse
[1:12:31] 15 and he said hearken
[1:12:34] ye all Judah and ye inhabitants of
[1:12:37] Jerusalem and Thou King Jehoshaphat thus
[1:12:40] sayeth the Lord unto
[1:12:42] you be Not
[1:12:44] Afraid nor
[1:12:47] dismayed by reason of this great
[1:12:49] multitude for the battle is not yours
[1:12:51] but is
[1:12:52] God's tomorrow go ye down against them
[1:12:56] remember this is this is an
[1:12:58] unconquerable army that's coming against
[1:13:00] them they had no chance but he says go
[1:13:02] down against
[1:13:03] them behold they come up by the Cliff of
[1:13:08] ziz and ye shall find them at the end of
[1:13:11] the brook before the Wilderness of
[1:13:15] jeru you shall not need to fight in this
[1:13:19] battle I'm in 2
[1:13:22] Chronicles 20: 17 now ye shall not need
[1:13:26] to fight in this battle set yourselves
[1:13:29] stand ye still and see the salvation of
[1:13:33] the Lord with you when you love to hear
[1:13:36] a prophecy like that oh Judah and
[1:13:39] Jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed
[1:13:42] tomorrow go out against them for the
[1:13:44] Lord will be with
[1:13:47] you and Jehoshaphat bowed his head with
[1:13:49] his face to the ground and all Judah and
[1:13:52] the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before
[1:13:54] the Lord worshiping the Lord and the
[1:13:57] Levites of the children of the coites
[1:14:00] and the children of the kites stood up
[1:14:03] to praise the Lord God of Israel with a
[1:14:06] loud voice on high they were
[1:14:09] worshiping they were praising the Lord
[1:14:12] the battle hadn't even started yet and
[1:14:14] they were already praising the Lord for
[1:14:15] the victory because they had word from
[1:14:20] God and they Rose early in the morning
[1:14:24] and they went forth forth Into the
[1:14:25] Wilderness of
[1:14:27] tocoa and as they went forth Jehoshaphat
[1:14:30] stood and said hear me oh
[1:14:33] Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem
[1:14:36] believe in the Lord your God so believe
[1:14:39] in the Lord your God so shall ye be
[1:14:41] established believe as prophets and so
[1:14:44] shall you
[1:14:45] prosper and when he had consulted with
[1:14:48] the people he appointed singers unto the
[1:14:53] Lord that should
[1:14:55] that should praise the beauty of
[1:14:57] Holiness as they went out before the
[1:15:00] Army and to say praise the Lord for his
[1:15:05] mercy endureth
[1:15:08] forever so Jehoshaphat this great king
[1:15:11] this great
[1:15:14] warrior he receives word that the battle
[1:15:17] is the Lord's and it's not
[1:15:20] yours and brother he sends out
[1:15:25] not The
[1:15:27] Archers not the
[1:15:29] calvary not the footman he sends out the
[1:15:34] piano
[1:15:36] player he sends out the guitar
[1:15:40] player he sends out the
[1:15:43] singer he sends out the symbol
[1:15:47] player and he sends them before these
[1:15:50] great warriors and they start praising
[1:15:53] the Lord and they start singing
[1:15:56] and you got to wonder what these
[1:15:57] Warriors thought wow these little
[1:16:01] guys and here they go out before this
[1:16:06] Army that was before them and they're
[1:16:09] singing and they're praising just like
[1:16:12] we were doing today sister hope we're
[1:16:14] singing We're praising we're loving the
[1:16:16] Lord and that's what they're doing
[1:16:19] they're out there just thanking God
[1:16:22] singing how important is it
[1:16:25] to praise him to love him and to sing
[1:16:28] praises to Him and they go they go down
[1:16:32] and what they didn't know is over here
[1:16:34] the Lord had ordained another Army that
[1:16:37] nobody knew about it wasn't from Judah
[1:16:41] it wasn't from Israel it was for someone
[1:16:43] else and then this Army comes out and
[1:16:47] starts fighting with this other Army and
[1:16:50] here's the singers and they're praising
[1:16:52] and they're singing and they're playing
[1:16:55] and they're
[1:16:56] going and they're fighting and killing
[1:17:00] each other all these other
[1:17:02] people and then once they're done then
[1:17:06] the army that I was just talking about
[1:17:08] this big one then they get all scared
[1:17:10] and they start fighting each other and
[1:17:13] every man every Warrior was
[1:17:17] killed so here comes the army of
[1:17:20] Jerusalem they come
[1:17:22] down and all they see
[1:17:26] is dead
[1:17:28] bodies they don't see there's not a
[1:17:31] there's nobody to
[1:17:32] fight and it's because the worshippers
[1:17:36] went forward if the musicians could get
[1:17:38] ready and what I want to do is I want to
[1:17:40] give us a little taste of we what we had
[1:17:42] last night with our musicians and and
[1:17:45] playing and singing and that's what
[1:17:47] happened here is the worshippers went
[1:17:50] out and and as I said don't ever
[1:17:52] underestimate the power of worship
[1:17:56] worship it's wonderful when things get
[1:18:00] hard I Praise
[1:18:02] Him amen when things when I get all
[1:18:05] turned around when I get sick I praise
[1:18:07] and brother Jeremy back at this when
[1:18:10] when I talked to him before I came out
[1:18:12] here he was praising God not because he
[1:18:16] got
[1:18:16] hurt but he was praising God that that
[1:18:19] the Lord protected
[1:18:21] him and can you imagine how the
[1:18:24] worshippers they go out before the
[1:18:26] before the the Army and they're praising
[1:18:29] and here comes the Army and you know
[1:18:31] what happened even if you couldn't sing
[1:18:34] you started praising you started singing
[1:18:38] you started praising you started
[1:18:40] thanking God for his goodness and that
[1:18:43] same God that was back there with the
[1:18:46] King Jehoshaphat is the same God that is
[1:18:50] here and he is the same one that we
[1:18:53] worship today that's right bring him out
[1:18:56] of History yes sir Lord you are

[1:19:16] battles after that he went on this cross
[1:19:21] and he died and he destroyed
[1:19:25] death hell in the
[1:19:27] grave and then he raised up in the power
[1:19:31] of the Resurrection in the power of the
[1:19:33] Holy Spirit and then it's so wonderful
[1:19:35] that my sins were forgiven that day but
