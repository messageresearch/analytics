if they bring the words up we all can sing that song tonight together and Worship the Lord but we're just thankful we just want to say thank you for uh just being being brothers and sisters in like faith and we're just thankful Lord to the Lord that we can be here and um we're just uh waiting uh here tonight with uh our brother David Fritz we're going to be hanging out with him tonight and fellowshipping and and then we got the my daughter and my son-in-law and my three grandchildren heading this way driving tonight so if you keep them in prayer the Brooks family they're going to be driving through tonight so we're just thankful we're we're looking to have a good time with them when they come and visit us in Arizona so but this Here song here I always said uh I like to sing a testimony and this is my testimony right here I always don't want to just want to be singing songs just to be seen or nothing like that but this is a real testimony in my life and I'm sure you all have share the same testimony [Music] so what's the uh other verse I'm going to start that's the one I'm going to start on thank you I have a source of strength when I am [Music] weak that takes me through when life is pressing me I have a source of power from above I've been covered over by his shield of blood I claim the blood Jesus shed on [Music] calary those precious blood stains were laid there just for me [Music] for all my sins all my sickness and my pain when I need healing I just claim those precious blood [Music] stains I do not know how others make it through who never go to Calvary as I do for there's a healing and a cleansing stream still flows where the peace that only his redeem can know I claim the blood Jesus shed on [Music] calary those precious blood stains were laid there for you and me for all all our sins all our sickness and our pain when we need healing we just need to claim those precious blood stains I do not know how others make it through who never go to Calvary as we do for there's a healing and a cleansing stream that still flows where the peace that only God's redeem can know sing it with me now I claim the blood Jesus shed on [Music] calary those precious blood stains they were laid there just for me for all my sin all my sickness and my pain when I need healing I just claim those precious blood [Music] [Applause] stains bless you brother [Music] s brother the s Marzulli I don't think we properly introduced him and his his wife I lost her where'd she go oh there you are God bless you sis welcome thank you for coming down and visiting us we appreciate it and then um brother Gabriel Murray bless you my friend it's nice to meet you yesterday brother Gabriel and I were fellowshipping and um just talking about how life sometimes times is hard and uh brother Gabriel was sell was sharing some of his testimony with me and it was just a real blessing and then our brother martin Warner came and and he started fellowshipping with us and then I got up and I left and I I went around and I came back and brother Gabriel had big tears in his eyes and and I heard the last part of brother Martin's testimony and it just blessed me so much I asked him I said brother why don't you just share it you're about to leave and go back home why don't you just share it with the people and I really believe it would be a blessing to them and and of course Brother Martin agreed you know I've met quite a few people over the past couple days that haven't known God that don't know him and I want to encourage I know brother martin that this is this is his life and it's my life but I want to encourage us all that if we meet meet someone to introduce them that gives you the joy in your life and let me tell you if with brother Ed here I can't introduce you to Ed dugall if I don't know Ed dugall myself so same thing with the Lord Jesus I can't int introduce you to Jesus Christ if I don't know Jesus Christ myself so we need to get to know the Lord we need to spend time with him we need to understand his ways we need to get before him and pray so that he knows us and that we know him and then we'll be able to introduce them to Jesus we'll be able to tell people more about the Lord Jesus the better we know so the more time we spend in his presence the more time we spend in his word the more we will be able to introduce someone else to this living Jesus Christ that means so much to all of us that's all Stan I wanted to also mention that sister Amelia called me today our dear little sister that sits here in the front she was very very upset she went to visit her um her mother who um or no it's her sister her older sister that's 90 years old I believe and she's not in good health and um so that's that's been a heavy burden for sister sister Amelia but today um she just found out that her oldest daughter died sister Amilia sister Mia's oldest oldest daughter so friends we're in this together we're a family in the Lord so remember when you get down and pray remember Sister Amelia sister's had a hard life and she's been really blessed by the church especially how the church has has grown over the past year and much of the growth from the church have been relatives to Sister Amilia so she's done a lot for all of us so let's do our part when we get quiet before the Lord and pray for sister milia milia I truly love her she's a she's a precious precious sister as I said sister Margie you're leaving us we um we love Brother Martin Warner he's he's not only he's he's a servant of the Lord he's he's a missionary he's a minister of the Gospel he's also a dear friend so I'm looking forward to hearing brother Martin's testimony so we might get to know this man a little bit better

my heart it just really feels like family it's closer than my flesh and blood it's closer than mother or father sister or brother son or daughter it is it is so close I just thank you for uh your fellowship in these last five weeks I I think or so that we've been here and uh I just wanted to say a few things to you maybe just be seated for a second we'll take this take we're going to read in Revelations tonight but uh I just wanted to thank brother Dan sister um I forget her name Stephanie sister Stephanie I I just my wife keeps reminding me I I want to call you something else and my apologies I I just appreciate you and brother Dan and the the load you're carrying here and we pray for you we do and uh we're holding you up in prayer um I wanted to thank uh them just for the fellowship we've had and just the support they gave us while we were here and just having a little place to stay and we just appreciate that and you know being a missionary uh you know we stay in a a lot of places and uh but my wife she she likes her own bed and she's she's on her way home already I'm sure in her mind so uh I just want to thank my wife also Having the courage to to come and just support me and uh also want to thank the the Peterson family again I I I don't know if uh sister Rachel is here is she here sister Rachel theur oh okay that that sounds right she's always doing something for someone else but but uh I want to appreciate them I I I was just dropped in on the the little lunch after the funeral yesterday and I just thought my just all the work that goes into that you know I'm sure you appreciate uh her and all those of you that helped I know many of you helped and you know if you if you appreciate someone then you ask them how can I help you know you could ask them how how can I what can I do amen and I just wanted to give her a round of applause for all she done am man I I have a little uh place in my heart connection with the Peterson Family through brother Al Peterson and I was up there yesterday to to the grave site and I just laid some flowers there it was kind of a appropriate time and then I came back for another funeral but uh I just uh got close with him even though he was 30 years my senior we just seemed to to to click and uh you know I could tell him anything I could tell them anything I I could just share share my heart with them and it was just like we were just on the same page and saw things the same way and I just want to Lord thank the Lord for that that time we had together while while he was here and and I know he's enjoying himself now with sister Minnie and in young bodies and my you know why would we want to stay here amen Saints and you know we're just they're just we sang that song we feel the pull amen I I'm feeling the pull now maybe it's my age too but I just feel that Dimension is so much closer now and uh and I don't know how much time we got I know it's really close amen but I wanted to greet you and express our love for the fellowship and thank brother Daniel sister Stephanie and you know I wanted to say it's you know it's it's a burden pray for your pastor um you know I've been around a little while so uh as you hear in my testimony uh it's easy to tear things down you know it's easy to tear building down but it's hard to build it it takes a lot of love and and dedication and all those things you know and we we need to support one another and we need to have and I appreciate brother Dan for the vision he has amen without a vision the people perish and and you you need to and we need to fall in line like uh brother hillbrand was my pastor for 38 years and you know he had a vision for Missions he had a vision for for Souls overseas and that's the way God L him and printing books and getting the message out and and we just fell in line with that sister Angela we just fell in line with that as young people we just fell in line we packed books we did this we did that you know we just fell in line with that vision and then God blessed it and you know we had our ups and downs we had our troubles and the prophet said any church that's not having trouble is not making it with God every church has troubles every church has problems amen and and that's how you know you know you're in the will of God sometimes because Satan's fighting you amen so I encourage you tonight to do that get behind the vision of your pastor and uh you know he asked me to take the service tonight and just give my testimony and and I just thought yeah well that's that's the Holy Spirit anything I can do anything I can do to help you know we just want to be a help and and uh I'd encourage you older ones too you know you have a you have a testimony and uh I was quite surprised in Edmonton when I heard some of the older brothers and their testimony it just really encouraged me because they were young people too they came to the Lord and it was miraculous and you know it was it was special and you know it just encouraged me to hear th to hear their testimony so I encourage you older ones too your older Saints you're appreciated and you're loved amen and and you know it's sometimes you don't think you're you're doing much but when you're here amen people are leaning on you they're they're looking at you and leaning on you amen you don't realize it and I remember the ones in in our church and how many years you know and there a lot of them are gone now and I remember just seeing them there just say a few words here hear some wisdom you know it's we've all got something to give amen so I encourage you to do that and uh you know uh do that and pray for one another uh you know the widows that are widows indeed I remember being uh staying at a a Widow's house for three years when I got saved and I learned the importance of prayer and and being a prayer Warrior so there's prayer warriors here you get you get on your knees and pray for the service pray for your pastor amen pray for one another and that's the strength of the church that's how we're strong Saints we can't do it by ourselves brother said we're in this together think if it was your daughter now that passed or my daughter how our hearts would break amen God help us Saints to to feel that love for one another and and put our shoulders to the wheel amen and just just press this battle we're we're on the last stage now Saints we're we're so close now so I wanted to ask you just keep us in prayer for the upcoming travel to Europe and then on to Africa for Easter and a lot of people be coming for those meetings from from many villages and small areas and you know we just just keep that in prayer I'll I'll send D brother Dan a text to remember us uh before the services amen so uh I just wanted to share those little Thoughts with you and thank you again for your your fellowship and I I we leave here richer people I leave here with a renewed burden you're leaving us rich amen I I I hope so and I I you know the burden to for Souls amen I I leave here with a renewed burden for souls and and you know Saints when that last one comes in you know just like the songwriter said call me gone call me out of here we're we're gonna be gone and that is so close so Revelations if you want to stand in chapter 3 we'll just read us a scripture there familiar to all of us I'll try to summarize my my testimony it's it's been a a while since I give my complete testimony but I'll I'll try to give you important parts and uh Revelations chapter 3 verse 14 and unto the angel of the Church of the lat ofans write these things sayith the amen the faithful the true Witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou are neither cold nor hot but I would that thou were cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth amen and we know the prophet talked about that is God would rather see us cold than in a lukewarm condition and he said if we fail to testify and give God glory we'll find ourselves cold old formal and backsliding testify testify to the to the store clerk testify to your schoolmates testify to you know when you get a chance when you get a chance when there's an opportunity take them aside the prophet said there's a better way or you know just as the Lord leads you but testify and and you know all we have to do is pray Lord just give me someone to testify I put some soul in my path amen and he'll do it it's just having the desire so he doesn't want us lukewarm because thou sayest I am rich increase with Goods have need of nothing knowest not that thou are wretched miserable poor blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and the shame of thy nakedness does not appear anoint thy eyes with is have that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent that's the Zeal of this hour is to repent how many repented to today amen yeah I had to repent today amen that's the Zeal there's nothing you know there's no shame in that that's the Zeal of the Bride behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will Su with him and he with me and the prophet said see it's it's to the individual it's now an individual thing we're a body but it's individual to him that overcometh will I grant to sit in my throne even as I over overcame and sat down with my father in his throne he that has an ear to hear Let Him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches may the Lord bless his word you may be seated I'll just uh just uh go into uh my testimony um as I was was saying we were sharing a little bit yesterday uh at the reception here and uh you know I told the brother I was speaking to it it just always humbles me you know and the prophet preached a message humble yourself and it always humbles me because there's things I'm not not proud of there's things I'm ashamed of and uh there's mistakes I've made and we've all made mistakes but not that we want to give go uh the devil the glory but just you know David said Look Back to the pit where you come from and the hole in the rock where God brought you from and sometimes it's good to look back you know and as I thought about it today brother Dan I was just you know putting putting some of the highlights together here and you know this came to my mind and that came to my mind and God did that and God did that and and I thought wow God's done a lot for me you know we all got something God a testimony is is what is it you said you got to know the person to have a testimony there there has to be uh you know uh an experience there so we all have got that amen and we we need to share if you can't do anything else tell somebody your testimony tell them how the fire got lit am mean you don't need to explain the message or Malachi 4 or Revelations 10 you could just say you know God saved me I was a drunker I was a I was an adulterer I was this that and the other I was a thief the Bible said such were some of us amen we we're we're not Angels the prophet said he never made us Angels Angels don't know what it's like to be redeemed but we know Hallelujah I'm so glad I know that tonight I was I was born in 1960 so you know that makes me 64 amen and uh uh I don't feel 64 but my body tells me I'm 64 my dad was born in Hartford Connecticut and uh his dad my granddad moved up to uh Eastern Canada Nova Scotia he he met my dad met my mom uh Scottish descent immigrants from Scotland and they married and uh had a had our family there in Nova Scotia which was New Scotland it if you go if you travel to Nova Scotia you'll see it's a lot like Scotland on the ocean there and uh so uh I was uh raised there my parents were heavy Drinkers and uh that's a large part of my testimony they they drank heavily so we we as children were exposed from that to that from our youth and you know we saw you know we saw a lot of the uncertainties in the home financially and and emotionally we we weren't you know we were kind of twisted or or you know bent a little bit because of that when you grow up in a home like that and uh I'm a little bit of a nervous person brother Dan I know you know that I I'm I'm a little bit neurotic I think sometimes I I don't you know I heard the prophet say don't don't let me try to uh explain the type of person I'm in I I am because he said I can't even explain myself you know I don't I don't know why but and I don't know why sometimes we're allowed God allows things to happen uh for a certain reason and it it brings out something also that nothing else can bring out and uh you know I was uh I I was like I said Till I was probably 19 when I left home 1819 I was exposed to that and even though uh you know I hated that I want to say to you young people if you have parents that are believers you pre you should appreciate them you should honor them you should pray for them like the scripture said it'll will give you long days and and goodness of life and blessings even just the natural blessings that'll come on you for doing that amen I I you know I look back and I said wow what if my parents had have been messaged Believers you know and had had the Bible out and you know the only time we took the Bible was when we were lying then then Dad would say put your hand on that Bible and swear to me whoa you know and then we knew we were going to die that we're going to die if we we lie this time and you know that but that's the only thing the only thing we I remember looking at the pictures in the Bible but well this looks Holy Angels and all that but didn't know anything about it just went to church just went to mass did the Stations of the Cross but there was a thirst in my heart all the time there was a thirst there but I didn't know how to fill it I didn't know what it was so anyway we we we were raised in that and uh I hated it but I fell into the same cycle of coping you know that's what people do it for you know the prophet preached a message letting off the pressure and that's what my mom and dad would do they let off the pressure on the weekends and sometimes for a week and fights and everything else like just terrible terrible the things I've saw as a kid it just it just emotionally it it it scarred me emotionally and and and and you know I didn't know how to cope with it and I fell into the same thing because it's a spirit isn't it common yeah and I didn't know the psychology of it or anything I just knew I was UN I was bound by the same thing that I hated I remember I remember going to bed crying at night just you know see my my mom and dad fighting and physical abuse and all those things I just I just hated it you know and I I I would just cry myself to sleep sometimes and uh just and yet you know I fell under that same thing because that's all I knew that's how I knew but they were they were Catholics they went to church you know and they they thought salvation was coming in the church being part of the church is salvation it's not I know coming here is not amen it's not salvation it's a personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you and me amen and meeting meeting that person like I told my sister I just got saved and I told her two weeks before she died I just told her I said Kathy I said I met Jesus Christ the man he's real it's you know all this Born Again stuff we heard about I said Kathy it's real she said Martin I'm so happy for you I think you found what you were looking for amen and and two weeks later she went off to scene and that's her testimony to me amen so I I believe I'll see her there brother Dan she'll be there amen so I started to get so depressed as a teenager in high school you know there was one time there was a man visiting my home and he was from the country and those old Scots you know they get together and and drink even uh moonshine and stuff like that you know it was uh and I just you know he'd been in he'd been in our house and and my mom was there my dad was away and I I just felt real bad you know that he was there and I out behind the house and I was just sawing some wood and all of a sudden I felt a presence and I can't I couldn't explain it to you if if I tried with a thousand words but it was like there was there was something here watching me someone here watching me a being and I couldn't I just kept looking around I thought someone was spying on me but I just felt this presence come down brother Dan all around me just like arms and I just felt oh my what is what is that and I so I then I quickly walked in the house and this man that was there he looked at me and he kind of like looked at me he said that boy will be a preacher someday a drunk he said that boy will be a a priest or a preacher someday and I didn't I didn't know what to do with that I just you know there's things in your life you remember and you think that was something I'd forgot and and and you think that was at the time that was very odd and so God has a plan that's all I want to say God has a plan and it might not be preaching it might might be this might be that you know but God has a plan to use you Amen to to to spread the the Gospel of Jesus Christ to win souls Amen to encourage the body to be a part of the body of Christ if we're just a fingernail or a toenail or whatever we are a prayer Warrior amen that's so important amen and so I I I just put that you know in the back of my mind but uh you know the drinking went on and I drank as a teenager at a high school but the scripture warns against it said W wine is a mocker Proverbs 20 strong drink is Raging and whoever who whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise it is it is not for Kings o limo it is not for Kings to drink wine nor princes to drink strong drink lest they drink and forget the law and pervert the Judgment give strong drink to them that are ready to perish and whine to those that are heavy hearts let him drink and forget his poverty and remember his misery no more you know so uh it can be a deceiver and and you know Satan with alcohol it's it's a counterfeit it's just a counterfeit for the stimulation of Revelation the wine of the word amen it's only a counterfeit and you know Satan makes you feel like oh you're with with the crowd you're in The In Crowd you're going to the same parties and and you know you you you got no worries no troubles and you forget all your problems and you forget all the dysfunction at home you know and that's that's the Trap that he sets and he's he's a master at it and young people today he's he's doing it maybe a different way he's doing on social media there's peer pressure there's all those kinds of things you know people get hooked on addicted to and I I I I just read recently a young man here in the states he uh he got on Facebook and posted some stuff about himself that he shouldn't have posted some pictures and then some some man from Nigeria blackmailed him and he ended up committing suicide you know Satan's got traps and if it's not one way it's another he wants to destroy young people in their youth and he's out to destroy you too young people I hope this helps you I hope you feel warned tonight that Satan has a trap but God has a plan amen Satan has a trap but God has a plan amen so I I just kept uh going on you know and uh after those experiences I you know I did get very dep depressed so depressed that I I felt like I wanted to die I wanted to get out of it and uh one night I I thought I decided to do that and and I was drinking and you know uh there's been several people in my community had died in in the straight of Cano which is a body of water that goes from the island to the mainland that people try to swim and they don't make it because of the currents and and I just decided to that I was going to try that and before I went though I thought I'm going to see my my best friend because I only had one friend that I really considered a friend and I wanted to see him for some reason I just wanted to see his face and I went to his house where his sister lived and she said no he's not here and uh I I'm here by myself but uh she said you look terrible what's what's the problem what's wrong with you I said nothing I was hiding it and uh she said come in come in come in for a minute so we sat down and she could see there was there was something definitely wrong wrong and uh I was determined what I was going to do and she said you know Martin she was a she was not a person that You' uh she didn't have a good reputation in town I'll put it that way and and she uh you know you'd maybe you'd call her a Rahab or something like that but you know here I am sitting with her and in in the house and she said you know Martin she said when I get I get feeling like you do said I I read this and she pulled out a little bible and she you know Catholics don't do that and she pulled out a little Bible and she read me something and I forget what it was but when she read that Bible that spirit of suicide just lifted right off of me it was gone and I thought that was stupid what would I do that for what would I end my life for and it was just it's it's like a cloud and and an oppression that comes and you know you just you can't you you have no way out there seems to be no way out so anyway God delivered me there after I got saved I went back to her brother Dan and I I bought her a Bible a real Bible and I put her name on it to Kathy McDougle my friend amen I thought you know God used her you know God puts people in your life and I I I I really believe that she'll have a reward on on the other side and and I I know she's been rewarded since then too but things like that would you know just I tried a few times but it failed and and just Satan is like a roaring lion seeking he whom he may devour and to take you out before God can use you so I ran away amen I I I finished trade school I uh got my trade in power engineering and uh got in trouble few times with the law and it was just my marks in school and and my parents that just I I didn't go to reform school or whatever because I hung with the wrong crowd and uh so you know like I said Saints there some of these things that humble me uh I'm not proud of them but you know we look back to where we come from and give God the glory amen and uh you know he he's used me around the world to give this same testimony and souls have gotten saved people have come to the Lord amen so I promise the Lord I would make it somehow and I've traveled too far to turn back now amen so God has a plan and you know we can never stop it I ran away from home 31 about 3,100 miles from Eastern Canada to western Canada and as I was driving into the city in western Canada on a bus I saw a sign on a green elevator that said what shall I profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his soul I'd never seen that before I'd never knew that scripture and here it is just staring at me when I'm going by and I'm looking at it thinking well that must mean something you know people are going to have to answer for those Witnesses those Billboards and those signs you see along the road they'll have to answer for those things amen they'll have to answer for seeing God in nature death burial and Resurrection everything preaches the gospel amen and you know it's hard to fight your way to hell it's hard it's A Hard Road and you have to fight your way to hell because heaven made a barricade amen and we have to climb over the cross trampled of blood you know and I I just thought boy all these things you know I ended up just working there in western Canada for a while and you know um my brother had a friend that asked me if if I if I could stay with him and I ended up working in the in the power plants of of Big Oil industrial companies and uh you know for power generation that was my trade and and but still I was thirsting see alcohol is a thirst and you feel it because your soul is thirsting and and we we didn't know that the prophet preached a message thirst a our brother Ed saying As the deer panth for the water so my soul panth after thee Oh God and I didn't realize that and I don't think people out there today realize that but uh the brother let me my brother's friend let me stay with him and I was working in a in the industry and uh I I I ended up at his place and I had a dream and my families are my family is is Dre I would say dreamers but they dream a lot and I had this dream and it was so vivid that I saw this great huge Beast like a dragon and he was on a sea of glass and he was and people were running for their lives and he was scooping them up and squashing them and killing them and uh you know it was just chaos and murder and and uh it was so visive that it just repeated and repeated and repeated all night I woke up the next day and I said said wow what a nightmare and all of a sudden I just felt that's something told me that's the end of the world that'll be what the end of the world would be like and I thought I wanted to I didn't want to tell my brother's friend because I thought well he'd think I was crazy you know I just I just thought that that was and I felt like that was going to happen in my lifetime and and what came to me was I need to be ready for that you know nothing knowing nothing about the scripture nothing about a prophet nothing about the end time you know I thought life was going to go on it was one big party but you know what when I when that happened that was I need to be ready and I just that thirst got how do I find that where do I go you know I didn't think I could find it in religion so I just I just left that job and and uh went running away again and you know but that did shake me and I met some people in Edmonton that were with Youth for Christ at the YMCA and they asked me about you know if I'd like to stay on a farm for young people I was about 20 years old and and that uh for Youth and they were Christians and they were good people and you know they they they did a lot for me and but it was a stepping stone for me but still that organized religion and that religion they they had and all the good works they did and I I thought you know that's not it that's not what I need that's not what I'm looking for you know you can't make it to heaven on good works and so I knew that and they had brought us to some different churches and I was exposed to maybe they go to a Baptist Church one week and and a Pentecostal in the next and and the Pentecostal one there was a preacher there and uh he was praying for people uh in the front at the altar and and uh he he he just came by me and he and he put his hand over me and he never touched me but he put his hand over me and it was like brother Dan the first time I experienced anything like that it was like a 10,000 volts just I just about went down you know I just it was it was a some kind of Supernatural anointing that was there and you know and and then what he was what they were wanting is that then speak in tongues and then you're filled with the Holy Ghost well it didn't come into me I didn't open myself up to to it but I knew there was a power there and so that that's another thing I put kind of in my pocket but I was still thirsting that didn't satisfy so you know I I continued my my drinking and uh the life of you know pleasure and sin for a season at 20 years old and uh I went I went into this weekend I went into a bar a club and the the the club's name was Lucifers Lucifers on a Friday night and the the devil was there they had the flashing light on the top the Devil with the Pitchfork you know and the big horns and you know Lucifers and it was all this music and and drinking and rry and you know and and that was on a Friday night and then uh I was so sick because I had I I had left that that farm or that ranch and I jumped on a train and I went to I was going to go back home and I was 3 days on the train made it to Ontario and then felt no I don't want to go home I want to go back you know it didn't know where where I was I didn't know what I wanted I didn't know what what I was trying to find so I got back on came back to western Canada drinking for three days no food Went to went to Lucifer's on Friday night and then Saturday I I was so you know that I guess it was that night yes it was that Friday night after after or Saturday that I was in Lucifer's that I was so sick I was laying on a bed in the YMCA and with had nothing to eat for three days and I I was I basically had alcohol poisoning and uh I fell into a trance what they call DTS but to me it was different than that I felt like I left my body and I went into this darkness and I knew I was going down down down sinking down and I and and I it just felt like the bottom was never there and finally I came to this place and there was a bright light and it was a fire a literal fire I can still see the flames in that fire and I was on and I was like on a on a on a rotisserie thing and I was going over that fire and the fire was just intense but you couldn't die you couldn't die die from it you just were tortured and that's what Satan is young people that's what he's got the the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life amen and I I I was going over and over in that thing and and then I saw women come to me they had no clothes on and they would just Decay when they come up to me they would decay in front of me and and it was like the smell of death all around me and and and and I couldn't communicate with no one and no one could communicate with me you know when you go to that place you're alone you can't communicate and and the worm doesn't die and the fire is never extinguished it's a real place people think you know nobody goes to hell these days everybody preaches everybody into heaven no there's a literal hell there's a literal burning fire there's a demension of the lost and we know that better than anyone else you know uh those women I remember seeing a woman out here on the street and the and the and the look of Terror and fear on their faces and I just saw a woman on the street there yesterday was just yesterday and I felt so bad for her she looked at me and she had this Terror on her face like a just like I saw just just before I give this testimony now just like I'd saw back there you know where we at Saints we are so close we are preaching to the souls that are in prison now amen and you know we we got to do if there's one Lord you know Abraham said if there's 10 but if there's one Lord Lord save that one send out a send someone to to get them amen and uh so I I was in that place and I I cried out for God and I think some of you know that part of my testimony I cried out for God no I didn't cry out for God excuse me I cried out for my parents see I cried out for my mom and my dad but they weren't there I cried out to my one of my best friends and he wasn't there you I was alone there was no one to cry out to and I I I you know it didn't it didn't even dawn on me in in that state to to ask God until I realized I'm not getting out of here and I I had an awareness Saints and God is my judge I had an awareness that my body was there but I couldn't get back What a Feeling what a terrible feeling and the prophet screamed out what a terrible thing to be lost heading for the Falls what a terrible place what a dreadful place to be in and you know and and so I cried out finally I said oh God oh God if you'll help me' I'll change tomorrow I promise you I vow I promise you I'll change tomorrow well I started to feel that I was coming back and I remember just waking up really like not even realizing like oh I I'm not in that place that was a nightmare that was that was something really different like that was so real so vivid and uh my bed was soaked with sweat like I had sweat so profusely from the alcohol was probably alcohol poisoning so I didn't realize that but my heart was there was such a pain in my heart a sharp pain that I thought I was going to take a heart attack and you know I I just I just said oh God thank God I'm alive I'm not in that place so I I I I quickly got up got dressed and no sooner I get dressed I heard to knock on the door and I always say Jesus knocked on my door A young man that was a backslid message believer running from the Lord knocked on my door and he said would would you help me and I looked at him he was clean cut you know I didn't I sized him up a bit he had had some stuff he said I need a place to store this stuff till I till I uh get my place and and I started a new job and he said would you help me and I thought there was a mill you know Pro probably a million people in that around that City well I thought I must be one in a million you are huh I must be one in a million so why did he knock on my door why did he ask me for help and I and I I just come from from Hell or the I just come from Lucifer's place and now this guy's asked me for help so I said uh yeah I guess so come on in so he put his stuff and he stay stored there for a few days he saw a little New Testament Bible the the use for Christ gave me and he said oh you you believe in god well I I I had an an you know I knew I had to say something I I knew I couldn't say no because I just asked God for help and I saidif you'll give me help I'll change tomorrow' so I said yeah yeah kind of well yeah I do and he saidwell would you like to come to church he was a backslid message believer and he was looking for a liquor store and he ran into a brother in the message that said no I can't tell you where liquor store is but I can tell you where you can find the Lord Jesus Christ that's all we need to do brother Dan is tell them come and see come to my church come come and hear the the word of God and so I I said yeah I guess you know yeah I better I better I promised so I thought it would be like maybe it would be maybe a Baptist or maybe it would be a Catholic but he didn't tell me anything he just said come so I went and there was brother Harold hilbrandt preaching the gospel and me with uh the yellow t-shirt Scotland long hair ratty jeans T you know ratty t-shirt put me on the front bench looking up at this preacher preaching the gospel I heard the gospel of my salvation and uh you know I went to dinner with some Believers that day that were uh in the church sister Angel you might know brother gun brother Gideon's father who uh witnessed to me a Chinese man with broken English eating Kentucky Fried Chicken can't never forget get it broken English and he said see the what the Bible says acts 238 repent and be baptized and as he was telling me the words were just jumping in my heart this is the truth this is what I need to do so I said yeah I said yeah I I'd like I'd like to get baptized he said okay I I tell I tell the preacher so they brother Harold was aware of it he was preaching that night and uh the whole time he was preaching he was preaching on The Crow and the dove the nature and and and I felt like I was the crow sitting in with all of the doves like these people are holy you know like they're they're good people like what am I doing here and and and this devil sat on one side and said you better get out of here you you don't belong here and and this the angel on this side said no stay there this is the truth and so it was yes no yes no I was numb after a while I was like what do I do and then all of a sudden the sermon ends and brother hillbrand I never forget it brother Dan uh he said does anyone have anything to say like he never ever opened it up for testimonies after the service never one time in 38 years do I ever see him do that again but he said does anyone have anything to say before I knew it I was on my feet I said listen I'm I'm the guy that was supposed to get baptized but said you know I can't I can't go through with this you know there's there's 100 200 people and I'm thinking why why am I standing up talking to all these people just this is you know I was numb and and he said well brother he said we don't force anyone to get baptized here we don't pressure anyone but he said you can go with the deacons and they can read the scripture to you if you decide you want to get baptized the tank is here so they they they brought me to uh Romans chapter 6 as we're buried with him in baptism as we are buried with Christ and baptism do you know that when you got baptized you were buried with Jesus Christ you know that's so profound and the prophet said because you were in him when he rose you Rose and the power of the Holy Ghost that's in you will raise yourself up he said in the resurrection if you go by the way of the Grave so when they said that that just put the nail in it you know I put the nail in Satan's coffin Hallelujah it put the nail in Satan's coffin because I knew two is a witness right so I knew so anyway I uh I I I was baptized that night in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and uh uh had a had a wonderful experience it took some time you know uh the prophet priest uh justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and uh I wasn't I wasn't quite clean yet that God had to do some some work on me and clean out some things and I might have sat in the church for maybe three four weeks and you know I I I I I just was faith comes by hearing hearing by the word and uh you know I I one day they were preaching on uh Holiness brother hillbrand and he was talking about 1 Corinthians 11 and he said if a man have short hair you know if a man have long hair it's a shame to him and I had sat there for a while with long hair and I never thought nothing of it I never thought the Bible said anything about it it wasn't like legalism I just thought and then I looked around oh yeah I'm kind of the only one around here like like I'm I'm kind of a standing out and then I had these corduroy pant pants on that were uh designer pants and they were real tight on the back with no pockets and and and when when the preacher was preaching he said and these these designers these homosexual designers he said they they make these pants with no pockets in the back I knew he couldn't see my pockets but I I just kind of felt back from my pocket no it's not there so I thought well I'm getting rid of these that's for sure and you know what next next week I'm going to get a I'm going to get a haircut and I said if I look like a monkey which I look like a monkey with the long hair but I said if I look like a monkey I'm G to get my if that's what the Bible says you see the message is not legalism Saints the message just is just obeying full obedience to every word of God entitles you to the Token so take those steps and as I took those steps God then came with the baptism of the Holy Ghost but it was a process and uh I'd like to say you know I think it's 8:30 is it now we start at 7 8 I'd like to say my testimony ended there and but you know I open that door and you're the only one that can open that door my experience will be different from you but you remember when God knocks on your door sometimes he'll knock on your door you you don't have to be an alcoholic it might be it might be another pressure it might be another oppression or it might be something else that you need to answer that door and let Jesus Christ into your heart it's so simple isn't it salvation it's so simple you know I didn't knew nothing about a prophet nothing about Malachi 4 The Prophet's name was being mentioned but I never even heard it it was just like I walked into the Bible and these people had the holy ghost that's why I say you older ones you created an atmosphere for the younger ones amen I don't have to call your names you know who you are amen you create that you're that core you're that you're those pillars amen and and I I thank God for those old Saints amen that when I was at that altar you know crying out for the Holy Ghost they were praying with me they were praying for me they were praying me through that birth canal amen glory to God it's the same holy ghost that it was that night it's the same one now and I'm not let Satan take that away from me that seal that fire amen burn on Saints burn up burn on let the power of God fill our lives in every way we can and like I said we're not you might not be out on the street testifying praying for people casting out Devils but you got a testimony you got a testimony like brother C coffee there just a mistake a phone call amen it just yeah well maybe I should talk to him about the Lord amen so anyway I you know I listen to the message today doors in a door and the prophet uses Revelations chapter 3 and he talks about doors and the door you know I open that door for Christ to come in my heart and he did and he filled me with the Holy Ghost and he used me I started to Deacon in the church I was then preaching once in a while and then I'd go on the street and testifying ministering and started to travel up north and the among the Native Indians and then on to Alaska among the eskimos and you know saw many things and saw many Supernatural things and healings and different things and I God started to use me and I I I you know I thought wow this is not nothing like turned out that I was that I had planned I didn't plan on any of this I running running away from that and God had to really do something there to get me to to actually do that but uh I started to feel after a while I started to feel a little proud I started to feel a little proud a little pride came in I'm a little bit better you know I'm a little bit I'm a little bit more special uh you know I'm kind of I'm kind of a great guy you know you know the prophet said that about Joseph he said he he started to think he was a great guy because he had visions and dreams and he and he and he was lording it over his brothers anybody out there amen and I just started to feel a little proud and you know what the scripture said Pride cometh before a fall and you know the Lord let me fall flat on my face and you know I wanted I I walked away I wanted to get away from the ministry I thought I I don't I want you know it was just selfishness and I I told you this here before I went I had such a complex and I I just it was all about me you see it was all about me and I thought you know that that then God has to do something with you God has to do something with you and I you know I I just quit I quit the ministry I I got out of it I I got out of it for four years from 2000 to 2004 some of you don't know that but uh I was sharing that you know and and and I was backslid really if you're not where you were with God when when you were close to God and you're not there now you're backl in any form amen Saints the Zeal of the Bride is to repent Lord Lord restore unto me the joy of thy salvation take not thy Holy Spirit Spirit from me amen I went through a really hard time I and I I just give glory to God and the wife he gave me to stand by me brother Dan amen and uh you know she was there praying for me and you know and just being there and I and I read I was reading in the message perfect faith and the prophet was talking about a guy testifying to his his friends at in the boiler room he said about his wife because he was a new Christian his wife said honey it must be hard you you were in an alcoholic family you were drinking and all these things and you're going to have temptations you know but honey if you ever fall if you ever fail she said you come right back home praise God God bless you Sister margorie amen she's part of my Ministry amen and I and she was right there she could have left you know if I if I had continued in that you remember when brother brandom had that complex he said I'm just going up north and the Holy Spirit you'll become a bum you'll be a homeless person and you'll be among the homeless people and your wife will leave you you know when when that reality finally came through and all and all of the mixup you know I couldn't even see straight you know Satan he he won't stop Saints you know he's not going to stop because you you became born again you know and and let me tell you another thing there's other doors that once you let them in then then you got to make him feel at home so if he comes over to the door of Pride he said what's in here oh no don't go through that my private life don't go through that you know what I do in my home is is is what I do in my home but you know what you do in your home affects people here amen what we do in secret what we do in private affects people right here and it and it can and it can even give us a bad attitude or resentful spirit so anyway I would I I would say my testimony didn't stop there because God continued continues to open doors Amen in our hearts and we've got to let him let him go through the house amen this is your house this is your house maybe the musicians can come I want to just wind this down and uh there's probably more I could share but I I think I got the majority of it and you know I saw many supernal things and I I've saw since since God restored me you know I saw so many things in the ministry overseas and miracles and amen cripples and blind people and Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen he's still the same God still the same power he said you know cast out Devils he said raise the dead they're still being raised God still raises the dead amen praise God there's a witness amen so he still raised the dead he still heals the sick amen you just you just open every door Saints I don't know what I was referring to there that song I was referring to white as snow amen let's Stand Together amen you know if you might be here tonight and feel that like maybe I'm not where I should be and like the woman said you know I'm not I'm not what
