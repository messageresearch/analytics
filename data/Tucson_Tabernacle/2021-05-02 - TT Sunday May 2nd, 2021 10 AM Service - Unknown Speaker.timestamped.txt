[41:49] amen thank you musicians thank you
[41:51] sister martha
[41:53] shannon for helping us i know we've got
[41:55] a few of them are out on
[41:56] uh at the meeting so brother sean martin
[41:58] and them are having meetings over in
[42:00] i think it's west virginia someplace
[42:02] like that we were watching streaming
[42:04] some of their meetings there last night
[42:05] you're just having a wonderful time and
[42:07] they were taking pictures of all the
[42:08] young people going through the prayer
[42:09] line and my son was on the front row and
[42:13] amen it was just good to see so many of
[42:15] the believers there but
[42:16] amen god's here today with us do you
[42:18] believe that
[42:19] amen blessed be the name of the lord i
[42:21] just want to make a couple announcements
[42:23] if we could
[42:24] we had announced that we were going to
[42:26] have the communion tonight
[42:28] but just a little bit uh brother anthony
[42:31] had got with me he's a young brother
[42:33] been coming to church a little bit and
[42:35] so he came friday night to the
[42:36] fellowship there where some of us came
[42:38] together and fellowshipped and
[42:40] we just began to talk and he asked me
[42:41] about water baptism and he wanted to be
[42:43] baptized
[42:44] so that's wonderful we went through the
[42:47] scriptures of water baptism and how the
[42:50] bible says he that believeth and is
[42:51] baptized shall be saved you got to
[42:53] believe
[42:54] and be baptized on the day of pentecost
[42:56] they preached the gospel and the bible
[42:58] says three thousand got baptized
[43:00] amen so our brother wants to be baptized
[43:02] and he was going to invite several of
[43:03] his family members and we were just
[43:05] thinking with the communion it might be
[43:07] a little um awkward the way that we
[43:09] would do that to have some
[43:11] wait for the baptism to be over to have
[43:13] communion or wait for the communion to
[43:15] be over to do the baptism so we thought
[43:16] we might
[43:17] move the baptism or the the communion
[43:19] until next
[43:20] sunday if that's okay would that be
[43:22] alright with everybody we just moved to
[43:24] communion to next sunday next sunday's
[43:26] mother's day
[43:27] be a special day to honor our mothers so
[43:30] if it's okay maybe we'll have the water
[43:32] baptism tonight and if there's anybody
[43:34] else who'd like to be baptized
[43:35] the pool is open amen when the was it
[43:38] philip he preached the gospel in acts
[43:40] 8 and he said here's water what does
[43:41] hendrix i think i'm done thank you
[43:45] thank you they're so patient with me and
[43:48] so
[43:48] i was thinking about that when philip
[43:50] got done preaching jesus he said here's
[43:52] water
[43:52] i want to get baptized so we have a pool
[43:54] of water and
[43:56] amen if you want to be baptized today
[43:58] would be a good day
[43:59] we set some chairs out i noticed it's
[44:01] been getting hotter so we just set some
[44:03] chairs out in the
[44:04] foyer area here after the service if you
[44:06] want to sit there and fellowship
[44:08] and and do that that would be a good way
[44:10] to be out of the heat
[44:12] you want to be out in the area there and
[44:14] we've got another building there it's
[44:15] good for games and
[44:17] you all had a birthday party for me a
[44:18] couple weeks ago that was really nice to
[44:20] have it up there god bless you for that
[44:22] and
[44:23] so i just wanted to thank the sunday
[44:25] school teachers that taught this morning
[44:26] god bless you all the ones that give
[44:28] their life to help
[44:29] let's give them a little round of
[44:31] applause god bless them
[44:33] amen it's not easy being a sunday school
[44:35] teacher i'm a sunday school teacher back
[44:37] home
[44:37] my wife is the other sunday school
[44:39] teacher so when we're gone my son
[44:41] william fills in and then my
[44:42] daughter-in-law
[44:43] does the other sunday school class so i
[44:45] know that when i was a young child
[44:48] they taught me sunday school i can go
[44:49] back and tell you verses that they
[44:50] taught
[44:51] classes that they lessons that they
[44:53] taught me that stays with me
[44:54] it's just different sometimes when
[44:56] somebody else says the same thing and it
[44:58] sticks with a child and stays with them
[45:00] so
[45:00] god bless our young people and god bless
[45:02] you parents for coming early
[45:04] and supporting them i drove up and some
[45:05] of the parents were here very early and
[45:07] god bless now the sunday school teachers
[45:09] are clapping
[45:10] doesn't do it amen so let's just try to
[45:14] support
[45:14] remember we read that last week when
[45:16] brother branham said he had he dedicated
[45:18] the church and what house will you build
[45:20] for me he said now we're going to need
[45:21] sunday school teachers
[45:22] now he wasn't going to have to have
[45:23] sunday school teachers if he didn't
[45:25] intend for children to go to sunday
[45:26] school
[45:27] so god bless them amen praise the lord i
[45:31] got a little
[45:31] message on my heart um there and
[45:35] i i don't know i need to talk to the
[45:37] brothers about these
[45:38] red pieces of tape on our pews here
[45:43] those social distancing things i don't
[45:45] know what it is we seem to be doing it
[45:47] up front but the back it doesn't we're
[45:48] not social distancing back there so i
[45:50] say we might as well just move all those
[45:52] people up here
[45:53] talk to him about taking the tape saw
[45:55] tape off our pews
[45:57] i i got to be honest with you this is
[45:58] just really weird for me
[46:00] i mean it's just i'm used to this three
[46:03] rows being full of young people on this
[46:04] side full of young
[46:06] teenage girls and then the parents right
[46:07] behind them they're trying to find
[46:09] pews to get in there and so have you sit
[46:12] all the way in the back it's like man is
[46:13] it my breath but i took a breath
[46:15] in the back back there my deodorant but
[46:17] i think i'm good on that too
[46:18] so uh amen i'd like to see everybody
[46:22] maybe one day the holy spirit will just
[46:23] all be up close
[46:25] i'd like to have us all on the four
[46:26] first four rows and have us all just
[46:28] wrapped around here like jesus talking
[46:30] you know and having his on the boat and
[46:31] he's just all real close to each other
[46:33] and
[46:33] he had to take up a child so there had
[46:35] to be a child close to him right
[46:37] when he had so he had to be kids up
[46:39] close to the minister and he just took a
[46:41] child and set him on you here brother
[46:42] random
[46:43] what tape was i listening to the other
[46:45] day in georgia
[46:46] and you can hear this child screams
[46:48] through the whole tape they're just
[46:49] screaming scream but it didn't matter he
[46:50] just kept preaching on and preaching and
[46:52] so
[46:53] it didn't bother him at all so it won't
[46:54] bother me here's my wife who is right up
[46:57] here on the second row
[46:58] she likes my preaching though she gets
[47:01] it all the time
[47:03] amen no we just are it's good to be
[47:05] together
[47:06] amen love the lord if you have your
[47:08] bibles luke chapter
[47:10] 17 and also john chapter 18
[47:13] a little thought the kingdom of god is
[47:16] within you i just want to speak on that
[47:19] this morning a little bit contrasting it
[47:21] with the kingdom of the devil there's
[47:24] only two powers in the world the power
[47:25] of god and the power of the devil
[47:27] amen the devil wants to mix that all up
[47:30] amen but there's only two sides there's
[47:32] god's side on the devil side and today
[47:33] we want to be sure we're over on the
[47:35] winning side
[47:36] i read in the back of the book and those
[47:38] that were with jesus
[47:39] when so if you're not with jesus i want
[47:41] to encourage you today to get on jesus
[47:43] side get on the winning side
[47:45] amen luke chapter 17 and let's just pray
[47:48] before we would read the scripture
[47:50] heavenly father lord we just come before
[47:52] you we open your word
[47:54] pray god that you would just bless the
[47:56] scriptures lord and you know that i have

[48:09] the children and the teenagers and the
[48:12] adults and the parents every visitor

[48:29] you would just help us to minister to
[48:30] one another
[48:31] may you strengthen us and help us father
[48:33] we pray and bless the church lord and
[48:36] even
[48:36] brother anthony he had to work this
[48:38] morning lord but i pray you continue to
[48:39] deal with his heart as he's desired to
[48:41] be baptized tonight
[48:43] bless him lord and if there's others
[48:44] that have a desire to be baptized
[48:46] lord you said suffer the little children
[48:48] to come unto me and forbid them not
[48:50] may you bless the scripture today we ask
[48:52] in jesus name
[48:53] amen praise the lord luke chapter 17
[48:57] verse number 20 and when
[49:01] he was demanded of the pharisees when
[49:04] the kingdom
[49:05] of god should come he answered them and
[49:07] said the kingdom of god cometh not with
[49:09] observation
[49:10] neither shall they say lo here or lo
[49:14] there
[49:14] for behold the kingdom of god is within
[49:17] you
[49:18] behold the kingdom of god it's down
[49:21] inside of you
[49:22] so you got to remember these were people
[49:23] who were being overrun by the roman
[49:26] government to be like the russians come
[49:28] and taken over america
[49:30] and so we're being overrun by the
[49:31] russians and they're looking for the
[49:33] kingdom
[49:34] of america to be restored but jesus said
[49:36] the kingdom that i'm preaching to you is
[49:38] not a natural kingdom
[49:39] the kingdom is within you amen go to
[49:42] saint john chapter 18.
[49:46] saint john chapter 18 verse 30
[49:50] 30 you know let's just back up a little
[49:53] bit verse 33.
[49:55] saint john chapter 18 verse 33
[49:59] then pilate entered into the judgment
[50:02] hall again
[50:03] and called jesus and said unto him art
[50:05] thou the king of the jews
[50:06] and jesus answered him sayest thou this
[50:09] of thyself
[50:10] or do others tell it thee of me pilate
[50:13] answered am i a jew
[50:15] thine own nation and the chief priest
[50:17] have delivered thee unto me
[50:19] what hast thou done jesus answered my
[50:22] kingdom is not of this world
[50:25] if my kingdom were of this world then
[50:27] would my servants fight
[50:28] that i should not be delivered to the
[50:30] jews but now is my kingdom
[50:33] not from hence and pilate
[50:36] therefore said unto him art thou a king
[50:38] then jesus answered
[50:40] thou sayest that i am a king to this end
[50:42] was i born and for this cause came
[50:44] i into the world that i should bear
[50:46] witness unto the truth everyone that is
[50:48] of the truth heareth my voice
[50:51] amen next verse there pilate saith in
[50:53] him what is truth
[50:54] and when he had said this he went out
[50:56] again unto the jews and saith unto them
[50:58] i find no fault
[50:59] in him amen may god add his blessing to
[51:02] the word you may be seated
[51:04] i just want to take a few minutes here
[51:06] this morning and just speak of the
[51:08] subject the kingdom of god is within you
[51:11] the kingdom of god is within you they
[51:13] asked jesus about this kingdom jesus
[51:15] said my kingdom is not of this world
[51:18] and if you you you look at that the word
[51:21] world there if you study it in the
[51:24] scofield there i think there's a little
[51:26] k it says
[51:27] cosmos there in in saint john chapter 18
[51:30] verse 36 it said my kingdom is not of
[51:33] this world
[51:34] which is cosmos and you must understand
[51:36] that it's not of this world order
[51:38] we know that god created the heavens and
[51:40] the earth and so he wasn't talking about
[51:42] that world he was talking about
[51:44] the world the cosmos the world order
[51:47] amen and so
[51:48] if you brother mensch preaches a message
[51:50] in the future home it's about a three
[51:51] hour message but he talks about
[51:53] in first peter second peter chapter
[51:55] three verse six he talks about the world
[51:57] that then
[51:57] was the world that is now and the world
[52:00] that is to come
[52:01] and how that the world that was before
[52:03] noah's day god wiped the world off they
[52:05] call it he calls it the world but it was
[52:07] the world order he didn't destroy the
[52:09] world and create a new world but it was
[52:11] the world order
[52:12] so that's what jesus is saying here he
[52:14] said my kingdom is not of this
[52:16] cosmos my kingdom is not of this world
[52:18] order but my
[52:20] kingdom is is within you it's inside of
[52:23] you
[52:23] and as i begin to think about that
[52:25] because most people they get their minds
[52:28] just set they're so narrow-minded they
[52:29] think that the church of god is just
[52:31] their
[52:32] group of people and they don't have a
[52:34] global view
[52:35] of the church of the living god now the
[52:38] church of god
[52:39] the church means the ecclesia it means
[52:41] the called out ones i think we mentioned
[52:43] that on
[52:43] on wednesday it's the called out it's a
[52:46] people that are called out of the world
[52:48] so it's not a building the only reason
[52:50] we have a building is because there's
[52:51] ecclesia people that are called out
[52:53] and pretty soon you start with the small
[52:55] building i think in that message what
[52:57] house will you build for me brother ham
[52:58] said this is one that we moved from here
[53:00] to another one
[53:01] and then it looked like there was
[53:03] another one that he was talking about
[53:05] there but
[53:05] he said because as we grow and we need
[53:07] more but you only need a building
[53:09] because you have
[53:10] people in that building but sometimes
[53:12] people they join a church or they
[53:14] join a building we don't want to do that
[53:15] we want to join the church of the living
[53:17] god
[53:18] we want to talk about that so if you
[53:19] look in the and i mentioned this maybe
[53:21] the other day but i just want to maybe
[53:22] go back through it they say repetition
[53:24] is the best teacher
[53:26] repetition is the best teacher and
[53:27] anybody that's a teacher knows that
[53:29] sometimes you have to say it you have to
[53:30] say it
[53:31] you have to say it again but jesus only
[53:33] mentions
[53:34] or the word church is only mentioned two
[53:36] times in matthew mark luke and john
[53:39] the word church is only used two times
[53:42] in matthew mark luke and john jesus
[53:44] mentioned he said i will build my church
[53:46] in another place he said go tell the
[53:47] church if there's ought between
[53:49] someone to go so that's the only two
[53:51] times it's mentioned in matthew mark
[53:53] luke and john
[53:54] but the word kingdom the kingdom of
[53:56] heaven or the kingdom of god is
[53:58] mentioned 121 times
[54:01] 121 times jesus is talking about a
[54:04] kingdom
[54:05] a kingdom of god he's not just talking
[54:07] to the 12 disciples that are sitting
[54:09] there
[54:10] oh we got a brother that's either coming
[54:11] up to help me or
[54:13] god bless your brother you broke your
[54:15] toe they said the other day how you
[54:16] doing
[54:17] you're doing better praise the lord
[54:19] those toe ones are tough ones because
[54:21] they can't do much for them they just
[54:22] put a boot or a splinter
[54:24] you do the best you can but god is your
[54:26] healer amen he's the only healer
[54:28] he said i'm the lord it heals all of
[54:29] your sicknesses and all of your diseases
[54:32] you might have a tooth and they pull the
[54:33] tooth out to take away the toothache but
[54:35] only god can heal the whole
[54:37] the devil would like to send you some
[54:38] type of an infection it caused you to
[54:40] get a fever
[54:41] and that infection spread through your
[54:42] body and take your take your life but
[54:44] jesus said i am come that you might have
[54:46] life
[54:47] and that you might have it more
[54:48] abundantly the devil might create some
[54:50] type of a tumor or
[54:52] something like that in your body because
[54:54] of gmo or
[54:55] genetically modified foods or all those
[54:57] things might create a tumor
[54:59] and then the doctor goes in and maybe
[55:00] takes that tumor out but only god can
[55:02] heal the incision where the doctor took
[55:04] it how many understand that
[55:06] and then if you listen to a message
[55:07] brother random said life is a healer
[55:09] look that message up and listen to it
[55:10] it's so amazing brother man
[55:12] goes through and talks about that people
[55:13] think medicine is a healer medicine
[55:15] isn't a healer
[55:16] medicine is actually a poison that goes
[55:18] in and kills the bad germs in your
[55:20] body so that the good germs can become
[55:22] more predominant and overcome the bad
[55:24] germs
[55:26] amen he's the lord that heals all of our
[55:28] sicknesses and all of our diseases
[55:30] so i think it's so good for us that we
[55:32] open our mind up and broaden our mind up
[55:35] to see that jesus was bringing a kingdom
[55:38] to the whole world it was a global
[55:39] kingdom
[55:41] it wasn't just those little disciples
[55:43] that he was there in fact after his
[55:45] resurrection the people were there
[55:46] and it was looked like they were just
[55:48] going to stay there so god sends a
[55:49] persecution to jerusalem
[55:51] so that they flee and go to the whole
[55:53] world and start spreading the gospel
[55:56] amen sometimes god brings adversity to
[55:58] us not to
[55:59] destroy us but sometimes it's to cause
[56:01] us to testify of our faith in jesus
[56:03] christ
[56:04] you know after we move past matthew mark
[56:06] luke and john
[56:07] and you if you look in the new testament
[56:09] the who which is written to church
[56:11] churches like paul would say under the
[56:13] church that is galatia to
[56:15] in galatia to the church of the lady
[56:17] oseans to the ladies the church and lady
[56:19] asea
[56:20] the church is mentioned 109 times
[56:23] so now it's not jesus was talking to the
[56:25] kingdom
[56:26] but now he's paul starts writing letters
[56:28] to individual churches so we know the
[56:30] corinthians
[56:31] they had a lot of problems they had
[56:32] fornication in the church they spoke in
[56:34] tongues just openly
[56:35] and so he had to deal with that local
[56:37] church the ephesians he didn't have any
[56:39] problem with those problems
[56:40] those problems in the the ephesian
[56:43] church or the galatian church
[56:44] so we know that there's local bodies of
[56:47] christ but there is a kingdom of god
[56:49] i want to be a part of the kingdom of
[56:51] god there's only one way to get in that
[56:53] kingdom it's by the baptism of the holy
[56:55] spirit
[56:55] i believe it's first corinthians 12 13
[56:57] it says by one spirit are we baptized
[57:00] into this body of jesus christ and so
[57:03] once persons baptized into that there
[57:05] might be different assemblies people
[57:07] that gather together
[57:08] and we don't ever want to be against
[57:10] other assemblies if god causes someone
[57:12] else to labor in a different field that
[57:14] doesn't mean they're not god's children
[57:15] we just say god bless them and this is
[57:17] the field that god's caused
[57:18] us to labor in and be together so i was
[57:22] thinking that i gave some of the
[57:23] scriptures to the brothers there i don't
[57:24] know if they have them
[57:25] but romans chapter 14 verse 17
[57:29] the bible says paul is writing to the
[57:30] romans he said for the kingdom of god is
[57:32] not
[57:33] meat and drink but righteousness and
[57:36] peace
[57:36] and joy in the holy ghost amen the
[57:39] kingdom of god is within you so there
[57:41] should be righteousness within you
[57:43] there should be peace within you there
[57:45] should be joy inside of you
[57:47] amen because that is the kingdom of god
[57:50] in mark chapter 10 verse 14
[57:52] they were talking to him about the
[57:54] little children this is the verse i
[57:55] referred to
[57:56] jesus said he said suffer the little
[57:58] children to come and to be
[58:00] me and forbid them not for of such is
[58:02] the kingdom
[58:03] of of god for verily i say unto you
[58:06] whosoever
[58:07] shall not receive the kingdom of god as
[58:09] a little child he shall not
[58:11] enter therein i was listening to the
[58:13] message yesterday
[58:14] studying at the last couple days ye must
[58:16] be born again brother branham said the
[58:18] church makes this complicate
[58:20] complicated he said god makes it simple
[58:23] amen i love simplicity there's something
[58:27] very powerful about simplicity
[58:30] before brother branham preaches the
[58:31] seven seals and the revelation of the
[58:33] seven seals his message was
[58:34] god hidden and revealed in simplicity so
[58:37] a lot of people look for christ
[58:39] hidden in complexity but if he says look
[58:42] it's like this microphone if i
[58:43] hide this microphone right here and i
[58:45] hide it and it's hidden there i say
[58:47] let's find the microphone somebody goes
[58:49] in the balcony somebody goes out there
[58:51] somebody goes out in the yard trying to
[58:53] find it you don't go out there and look
[58:54] because you know it's hidden right here
[58:57] so when people try to go look for god in
[58:59] great complex things and you know god's
[59:01] hidden in
[59:01] simplicity amen when we get it so
[59:04] complicated that saint peter who could
[59:06] not read and write can't get it
[59:08] then we're way too complicated amen so
[59:11] except we become as a little children
[59:13] matthew chapter 6 verse 33
[59:15] then the bible says seek ye first the
[59:18] kingdom of god
[59:18] and his righteousness and all these
[59:21] things will be added unto you
[59:23] so jesus said there's a kingdom that i'm
[59:25] coming to build a kingdom
[59:27] and he said if you'll seek that kingdom
[59:29] first everything that you have need of
[59:31] in life
[59:32] he's going to add it to you and these
[59:34] are not just suggestions these are just
[59:36] not
[59:36] these are promises of god as a very
[59:39] young man i took these promises when
[59:41] we had great business opportunities
[59:43] somebody we got married we were very
[59:45] very
[59:46] uh poor and um and somebody came to us
[59:49] and made a great proposition to us a
[59:51] great
[59:52] business proposition probably taken care
[59:53] of all of our financial problems
[59:55] and it came down to this verse right
[59:57] here it was going to take me out of
[59:59] church
[1:00:00] it was going to take me away from a
[1:00:01] commitment to christ and
[1:00:03] i took this verse here seek ye first the
[1:00:05] kingdom of god and
[1:00:08] and all these things shall be added unto
[1:00:10] you and i took that verse
[1:00:12] and i based my whole life on that verse
[1:00:14] and i can tell you put god first in your
[1:00:16] life and he'll add everything that you
[1:00:18] have need of can you say amen to that
[1:00:20] maybe your weight in the balance see
[1:00:22] like i don't know if i should go to
[1:00:23] church and put god first
[1:00:24] and the devil will come and say look if
[1:00:26] you work i know the bible says six days
[1:00:28] shall labor
[1:00:29] and the seventh day you'll rest and
[1:00:30] dedicate it to god but boy i can make so
[1:00:32] much more money if i just worked on
[1:00:34] sunday or if i
[1:00:35] you know as we talked here a couple of
[1:00:36] weeks ago a lot of people instead of
[1:00:38] working five days a week and spending
[1:00:39] saturday with their family
[1:00:40] they work six days a week and then they
[1:00:42] put god on the back burner and do
[1:00:44] whatever they were going to do
[1:00:45] on saturday they do that on sunday they
[1:00:47] go to the store and they and they and
[1:00:49] when that should be a day dedicated to
[1:00:51] god
[1:00:52] brother ham said it was a holy day amen
[1:00:54] we don't go
[1:00:55] shopping and get gas and do those things
[1:00:57] on sunday this is a day dedicated to
[1:00:59] jesus christ
[1:01:00] somebody asked the other day and it was
[1:01:02] really phenomenal because christians
[1:01:03] we've been taught
[1:01:04] amen to go to church sunday morning and
[1:01:06] go to church sunday night somebody asked
[1:01:07] a question like what do people do on
[1:01:09] sunday night when they don't go to
[1:01:10] church
[1:01:11] what do they do if the day is dedicated
[1:01:14] to the lord
[1:01:15] pretty soon you find out all the things
[1:01:16] of the world start creeping in and you
[1:01:18] start
[1:01:18] working on sunday and this and this and
[1:01:20] all the things because i tell you what i
[1:01:21] got a thousand things back home that i
[1:01:24] could be doing
[1:01:25] and when i don't go to church then you
[1:01:26] you start doing those other thousand
[1:01:28] things it's good just to dedicate a day
[1:01:30] to the lord and say lord
[1:01:31] this is the day that you've made i'm
[1:01:33] gonna rejoice in it and i'm gonna show
[1:01:35] my children
[1:01:36] and my family that jesus christ is
[1:01:38] everything it's the most important thing
[1:01:40] i'm going to seek first the kingdom of
[1:01:42] god
[1:01:42] and god will add everything else that i
[1:01:44] need in my life he'll add it to me
[1:01:46] how do you know brother daniel because
[1:01:47] it says right there in matthew chapter 6
[1:01:49] verse 33
[1:01:50] that's why the devil a christian is no
[1:01:53] stronger
[1:01:54] than their knowledge and adherence to
[1:01:55] the word of god and i appreciate the
[1:01:57] brothers putting that up on the on the
[1:01:58] thing
[1:01:59] and i really do appreciate but i believe
[1:02:01] this is my heartfelt
[1:02:03] belief is that every person should have
[1:02:05] a bible
[1:02:06] this is god in letter form and you
[1:02:08] should have a
[1:02:09] a an experience with god it should come
[1:02:12] from the scriptures
[1:02:14] and when you have that i mean this is
[1:02:15] good for your mother you might nudge
[1:02:16] your husband say hey this would be good
[1:02:18] you should have a bible that you
[1:02:20] value amen and so that the bible says
[1:02:22] that
[1:02:23] it should be more than our daily meat
[1:02:25] god how jesus said man shall not live by
[1:02:27] bread alone but by
[1:02:28] every word that proceeds out of the
[1:02:30] mouth of god especially we father should
[1:02:32] have a bible
[1:02:32] i know this is really challenging but if
[1:02:34] you're going to lead your family
[1:02:35] hopefully you're leading them from the
[1:02:36] scripture
[1:02:37] and you can say hey it's not my word
[1:02:39] right here it's in the bible amen
[1:02:40] forsake not the assembling of yourselves
[1:02:42] together this is the lord's day
[1:02:44] amen we mark that in the scripture so
[1:02:46] when the devil will come and give you
[1:02:47] great propositions just like he
[1:02:49] said to jesus came look if you'll bow
[1:02:51] down and worship me i'll give you all
[1:02:52] the kingdoms of the world
[1:02:54] he'll make a lot of propositions he's
[1:02:56] come to me and made me a lot of
[1:02:57] propositions
[1:02:58] amen but my life is hidden in christ
[1:03:01] which is the word of god
[1:03:02] and we as men should have a bible and
[1:03:04] you go back and the devil tempts you go
[1:03:05] back
[1:03:05] right there matthew chapter 6 verse 33
[1:03:08] no we're going to seek first the kingdom
[1:03:10] of god
[1:03:11] we're going to rise in the morning
[1:03:12] before the day starts and we're going to
[1:03:13] seek
[1:03:14] the kingdom of god the last thing of the
[1:03:16] day we're going to pull our family
[1:03:18] together we're going to pray and
[1:03:19] whatever we've gone through maybe the
[1:03:20] devil comes in like a flood we sit down
[1:03:22] and we read our bibles
[1:03:24] and we read our bibles and we pray
[1:03:25] together the family that prays together
[1:03:27] stays together i was thinking about that
[1:03:31] yesterday as i was going through that
[1:03:32] message he must be born again
[1:03:34] brother branham said because he was
[1:03:36] talking about this amazing message if
[1:03:37] you want to listen to it you must be
[1:03:39] born again brother branham was talking
[1:03:40] about
[1:03:41] every church believes in the new birth
[1:03:43] it doesn't matter you're baptist
[1:03:45] methodist pentecostal i think they said
[1:03:46] jimmy carter even was a born-again
[1:03:48] christian
[1:03:49] so it all comes down to a definition
[1:03:51] what do you call a born-again christian
[1:03:53] what is a born-again christian
[1:03:55] because jesus said that in in
[1:03:58] saint john chapter six uh
[1:04:01] if you i don't know if i put that one on
[1:04:03] there saint john chapter six if you have
[1:04:04] a bibles maybe we'll go back there saint
[1:04:06] john
[1:04:07] i'm sorry saint john chapter three now
[1:04:10] most of us can quote
[1:04:11] john 3 16 for god so loved the world
[1:04:13] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:04:15] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:04:16] perish
[1:04:17] but have everlasting life for god sent
[1:04:19] not his son into the world to condemn
[1:04:21] the world but that the world through him
[1:04:22] might be saved where'd you learn those
[1:04:23] verses brother daniel
[1:04:24] in a christian environment it just
[1:04:27] didn't happen it's being in a christian
[1:04:28] home and
[1:04:29] being in a christian school our parents
[1:04:31] they made great sacrifices for
[1:04:33] for me to be in a christian school
[1:04:35] actually my dad went and
[1:04:36] borrowed the money to put me in a
[1:04:38] christian school so i would be in a
[1:04:40] christian environment
[1:04:41] and that's not always possible but i
[1:04:43] believe brother m tells us that keep
[1:04:44] your children and christian fellowship
[1:04:46] as long as you can
[1:04:48] as long as you can come friday night and
[1:04:50] that's why we opened up the thing there
[1:04:52] the other friday night the kids are
[1:04:53] going to be somewhere they're going to
[1:04:54] be with some friends
[1:04:56] and this is going to be a real shocking
[1:04:57] revelation
[1:04:59] get ready your children are going to
[1:05:00] marry somebody that they know
[1:05:02] and one of their friends so whoever you
[1:05:05] put before them as friends
[1:05:07] they're going to marry one of those
[1:05:08] people so i say it's so important to
[1:05:10] keep them with
[1:05:11] good christian friends keep them with
[1:05:13] believers
[1:05:14] amen and not with the world amen so
[1:05:17] john 3 16 we can all quote that but if
[1:05:19] you go back just a few scriptures before
[1:05:21] this i know this is really slow and
[1:05:23] and maybe we're just going through but i
[1:05:25] think we should learn the scriptures
[1:05:26] they should become a part of us
[1:05:28] i mean just like your christian walk you
[1:05:30] mix many things together some of your
[1:05:32] sisters make cakes or you make bread
[1:05:34] and you mix maybe you're making bread my
[1:05:35] wife got a couple bread machines over
[1:05:37] there she's making bread the other night
[1:05:39] or the other day and you mix this
[1:05:40] ingredient this ingredient and then you
[1:05:41] mix it all up
[1:05:42] and then where's the sugar where's the
[1:05:44] milk where's the eggs they became part
[1:05:46] of it
[1:05:47] and we as christians we grow and this
[1:05:50] word should become part of us
[1:05:53] amen so as you add every time you come
[1:05:55] to church here a little there a little
[1:05:57] amen line upon line word upon word you
[1:05:59] add this to your christian
[1:06:01] life your christian walk with god that's
[1:06:03] why it's so important that we
[1:06:05] we talk about the bible brother
[1:06:06] yarborough had a big in
[1:06:08] influence on me i just knew him i met
[1:06:10] him a couple times but he had an
[1:06:11] influence and he was so
[1:06:12] uh such a preacher of the bible
[1:06:16] amen it's such a powerful thing in this
[1:06:18] world they've their minds have drifted
[1:06:19] off we need to get back to our bibles
[1:06:21] and hold it close as i said before so
[1:06:23] many times when
[1:06:24] kids have uh you know i ask them to
[1:06:26] consecrate their lives to god i want
[1:06:28] them to have their bible with them
[1:06:30] because we're not bringing you to this
[1:06:31] church we're not bringing you to brother
[1:06:32] daniel's ideas
[1:06:34] we're bringing people to the word of god
[1:06:36] and man shall not live by bread alone
[1:06:38] but by
[1:06:38] every word that proceeds out of the
[1:06:40] mouth of god amen
[1:06:42] i was thinking about that because we're
[1:06:43] not trying to get people to live by our
[1:06:45] creeds or my ideas
[1:06:46] i'm trying to get to you to the
[1:06:48] scriptures i might
[1:06:50] as i told my children i said look if
[1:06:52] daddy dies
[1:06:53] this is still the truth this is still
[1:06:55] the truth if
[1:06:56] if something you know brother perry
[1:06:58] green was here and he believed things
[1:06:59] and now he's gone but it's still the
[1:07:01] truth it's still the word of god
[1:07:03] brother yarborough preached the
[1:07:04] memorization of the scriptures and had
[1:07:06] that and now he's gone but it's still
[1:07:07] the scriptures it's still the truth
[1:07:10] and i tell you when you anchor your soul
[1:07:12] to the bible you'll stand i tell you the
[1:07:14] winds will blow
[1:07:15] who was it jesus said in in about the uh
[1:07:18] the winds he said whosoever heareth
[1:07:19] these sayings of mine
[1:07:20] and bl heareth them and do with them
[1:07:22] he'll be like a a tree
[1:07:24] no hold on a minute it's over in matthew
[1:07:26] isn't it matthew 7.
[1:07:28] and he says he'll be like a house it's
[1:07:30] built upon a rock
[1:07:32] and the rains descended and the floods
[1:07:33] came and they beat upon the house
[1:07:35] and it fell not because it was founded
[1:07:37] upon a rock
[1:07:39] amen in people's lives that's we were
[1:07:41] talking about wednesday night amen
[1:07:43] that those that hear the word of god
[1:07:45] he'll be planted like a river
[1:07:46] like a tree planted by the river of
[1:07:49] water
[1:07:49] the winds blow but the tree doesn't move
[1:07:52] why he's planted somewhere
[1:07:54] and our faith should be planted in the
[1:07:56] word of god when the winds blow
[1:07:58] when culture changes when they redefine
[1:08:01] marriage as a as a relationship between
[1:08:04] a woman and a woman and a man and a man
[1:08:07] your mind doesn't blow with that like
[1:08:09] well i guess live and let live
[1:08:10] no it goes back to the scripture jesus
[1:08:13] said therefore shall a man leave his
[1:08:14] father and mother and cleave to his wife
[1:08:16] and they shall be one
[1:08:17] jesus christ instituted marriage he made
[1:08:21] the man and the woman and he defined
[1:08:22] marriage
[1:08:23] is that okay and you know what if it
[1:08:25] time goes on a hundred years
[1:08:27] and pretty soon because listen to me
[1:08:29] we've just seen the tip of the iceberg
[1:08:31] you wait five years and they'll say hey
[1:08:33] well if a man can marry a man
[1:08:34] and a woman a woman why can't i marry my
[1:08:37] horse
[1:08:38] and my horse get my life insurance when
[1:08:40] i die
[1:08:41] and why can't i marry my cat and my cat
[1:08:43] be on my health insurance
[1:08:46] you think this is just the end of it no
[1:08:47] it's just the beginning
[1:08:49] it's just the beginning the bible says
[1:08:51] by him all things consist
[1:08:53] the word of god amen is what causes this
[1:08:56] nation and our minds come together
[1:08:58] and you look how these little things
[1:08:59] blow and pretty soon they blow
[1:09:01] and pretty soon they say okay a girl you
[1:09:03] a little teenage girl you can say hey
[1:09:05] i'm a boy and then you can go in the
[1:09:06] boy's bathroom
[1:09:08] and pretty soon it goes brother man said
[1:09:10] pretty soon we get so smart and then it
[1:09:11] backfires on us
[1:09:13] and all the women like hey we want equal
[1:09:15] rights we want to be right with the men
[1:09:16] i mean like you're right you're right
[1:09:18] equal rights we want to be equal with
[1:09:19] you but guess what
[1:09:20] we're going to have we're going to then
[1:09:22] have the right to be in every one of
[1:09:23] your sports events
[1:09:24] and we have testosterone so we're way
[1:09:27] more physically advanced from you
[1:09:28] and we take all of your awards because
[1:09:31] we can run faster we can lift more
[1:09:32] weights because we have
[1:09:34] a god-given testosterone in our body and
[1:09:36] now they're screaming like oh it's
[1:09:37] backfired no no no you can't be a
[1:09:39] transgender and be in our sports no no
[1:09:41] you can
[1:09:42] it's got to go both ways you see how all
[1:09:44] things consist just the simple things of
[1:09:46] life
[1:09:47] totally remodeling every bathroom has to
[1:09:49] be because now it has to be transgender
[1:09:52] you see how these little things they go
[1:09:54] and they pass a little legislation the
[1:09:56] bice the bible says by him all things
[1:09:57] consists it's held together
[1:09:59] and when you take god out of the
[1:10:00] equation then the whole thing becomes a
[1:10:02] muck
[1:10:02] it all falls apart oh let's just
[1:10:05] christians keep the mind of christ jesus
[1:10:06] said let the mind that was in christ let
[1:10:08] it be inside of you
[1:10:10] lord let your mind be inside of me
[1:10:13] so saint john chapter 3
[1:10:17] praise the lord we don't have a
[1:10:19] quarterly that we give out you
[1:10:22] we've got a few notes here but we don't
[1:10:23] know where the holy spirit is going to
[1:10:25] help us because we got you say oh it
[1:10:27] doesn't bother me i sit in my house and
[1:10:28] listen to brother branham but
[1:10:30] our children don't sit there they're out
[1:10:32] there engaging every day in work and
[1:10:34] realizing that hey
[1:10:35] if i say this one thing right here i
[1:10:36] could lose my whole career
[1:10:38] i could lose everything that i have i
[1:10:40] just and so the bible says be
[1:10:42] jesus tells us don't go out there and
[1:10:43] just say hey no he said be wise as
[1:10:46] serpents
[1:10:47] and harmless as a dove you can never
[1:10:50] come you have to realize especially
[1:10:51] brother people go to college like i got
[1:10:53] this education i got this
[1:10:54] and but you have to realize in a
[1:10:56] moment's time you're going to be
[1:10:58] asked to either keep your education and
[1:11:00] conform to this world
[1:11:01] or give it all up in a moment's time oh
[1:11:04] brother daniel i couldn't do that well
[1:11:06] then maybe you couldn't be a christian
[1:11:08] because joseph got to the place in that
[1:11:09] place where he was way up in the
[1:11:11] corporate world
[1:11:12] and remember potiphar's wife come and
[1:11:13] ask for sexual favors and he gave up his
[1:11:15] whole career and went to a prison
[1:11:18] here's who was at daniel he was 80
[1:11:21] something years old and they passed the
[1:11:22] law it says you can't pray and he said
[1:11:24] i'm going to pray
[1:11:25] i don't care what and they said well
[1:11:26] you're going to the lions then he said
[1:11:27] well put me in the lion then
[1:11:30] or maybe we've got shadrach meshach and
[1:11:31] a three bend to go three little
[1:11:33] children there and say look we're gonna
[1:11:34] play this music and when we play this
[1:11:36] music we want you to dance and we want
[1:11:38] you to do this
[1:11:38] and we want you to compromise your
[1:11:40] morals
[1:11:42] i said look you don't have to give us
[1:11:43] another chance because we're so
[1:11:45] deeply rooted our faith is in jehovah
[1:11:47] god and you don't have to
[1:11:49] the result is going to be the same oh
[1:11:51] blessed be the name of jesus
[1:11:53] i trust they're still christians today
[1:11:54] like shadrach meshach and abednego and
[1:11:57] they have an experience with god and
[1:11:58] their roots
[1:11:59] go very deep into the word of god it
[1:12:02] doesn't matter they say look we're going
[1:12:03] to throw you in the fiery furnace this
[1:12:04] wasn't
[1:12:05] a virtual fire they heated up seven
[1:12:08] times hotter
[1:12:09] and the men that were throwing them in
[1:12:10] there actually died
[1:12:13] oh but a little persecution all it did
[1:12:15] was break their bonds off of them
[1:12:17] i think that'll do what it'll do for us
[1:12:19] sometimes a little persecution
[1:12:21] cause you to raise your hands and say oh
[1:12:22] lord jesus i love you father
[1:12:24] blessed be the name of god maybe you
[1:12:26] maybe you never could
[1:12:28] worship the lord freely and then god
[1:12:29] sends a little sickness along you
[1:12:30] preaching it causes you to pray and seek
[1:12:32] the lord a little more
[1:12:33] then he heals your body it causes you to
[1:12:35] be thankful lord i thank you for today
[1:12:37] lord
[1:12:38] i thank you for your health lord i thank
[1:12:40] you for family i thank you for church i
[1:12:42] thank you for music
[1:12:43] i thank you for our song leaders we
[1:12:46] ought to be a thankful people
[1:12:47] it's amazing in america we feel like
[1:12:49] this is entitlement
[1:12:51] and i i deserve this i deserve this the
[1:12:53] bible says naked came we into the world
[1:12:55] and naked we're going to go out
[1:12:57] it's really amazing listen to me now
[1:12:59] this isn't even in my notes we see
[1:13:01] socialism taking over our country
[1:13:04] what those people died for in south
[1:13:05] korea to fight back socialism it has
[1:13:08] taken over our country
[1:13:10] and people lose their job because of a
[1:13:12] pandemic like look
[1:13:13] we're going to plant a garden i'm going
[1:13:15] to get two little part-time jobs and
[1:13:16] we're going to make this thing work
[1:13:18] and the government comes in with
[1:13:19] socialism and look look just stay at
[1:13:21] home we'll send you a stimulus check
[1:13:23] just stay at home and they're training
[1:13:25] the people to become dependent on the
[1:13:26] government
[1:13:28] if they send you a stimulus check hey
[1:13:29] they're sending it to everybody take it
[1:13:31] cash it and use it but remember
[1:13:32] the devil has a plan amen he has a plan
[1:13:36] and brother m tells us that one day
[1:13:37] america will go bankrupt
[1:13:40] and then rome will come and buy it out
[1:13:42] with strings attached
[1:13:43] well look we'll pay you'll have your
[1:13:44] 401k you'll have your retirement back
[1:13:46] but there's just these little strings we
[1:13:48] got attached to it
[1:13:49] like these radical christian people we
[1:13:51] need to shut their churches down
[1:13:53] don't think you're going to be exempt
[1:13:55] from that amen they persecuted our
[1:13:57] fathers before us but there was a church
[1:13:59] that grew
[1:13:59] stronger amen when they gathered in the
[1:14:02] catacombs you were only in the catacombs
[1:14:04] for a reason
[1:14:05] you knew that your faith was the most
[1:14:06] important thing in your life
[1:14:08] it was above your careers above your
[1:14:10] family it was everything which are faith
[1:14:12] in jesus christ or you weren't there
[1:14:14] so persecution has always made the true
[1:14:17] church of god
[1:14:18] stronger and stronger and stronger maybe
[1:14:20] fewer
[1:14:21] numbers but we're not looking for
[1:14:22] numbers jesus is looking for
[1:14:25] quality if he was looking for numbers
[1:14:28] you know how do you say any man that's
[1:14:29] not
[1:14:30] willing to take up his cross and follow
[1:14:31] me is not worthy to be my disciple
[1:14:34] he wasn't looking for followers he was
[1:14:36] looking for disciples
[1:14:38] disciples are people comes from the word
[1:14:40] discipline people he said
[1:14:42] you're not worthy to be my disciplined
[1:14:45] student
[1:14:46] so he wasn't looking to have all these
[1:14:48] people he was looking for people that
[1:14:50] were willing to be
[1:14:50] disciplined and when he got all done he
[1:14:53] had 12
[1:14:54] and one of them was a devil and then a
[1:14:57] few hours later peter was a cousin
[1:14:59] preacher
[1:15:00] denied he ever knew and so jesus said
[1:15:02] look i gotta i'm gonna go away
[1:15:04] because walking with you that's why it's
[1:15:06] people think well if i was with the
[1:15:07] preacher i would
[1:15:08] he could just but no peter was right on
[1:15:11] the boat and all
[1:15:12] and he discussed i don't even know
[1:15:14] anything about this religion i don't
[1:15:15] know anything about this
[1:15:16] what did he need he needed an experience
[1:15:18] with jesus christ
[1:15:20] and what happened on the upper room when
[1:15:21] the holy ghost came down and filled his
[1:15:23] life
[1:15:24] amen it gave him what he needed he ran
[1:15:26] out into the streets and
[1:15:27] this same jesus that you crucified as
[1:15:29] both lord and christ and that's what all
[1:15:30] of us need we need an experience with
[1:15:32] god
[1:15:34] i'm telling you that's what's happening
[1:15:35] around us and people they come and
[1:15:37] they're associated with a message and
[1:15:38] people
[1:15:39] and maybe even i hear great testimonies
[1:15:41] people give me their testimonies moving
[1:15:42] from california
[1:15:44] following the message and maybe mom and
[1:15:45] dad brought the the
[1:15:48] and they moved here but unless every one
[1:15:50] of those children had an experience with
[1:15:52] god
[1:15:52] they'll just drift off somewhere you
[1:15:55] must be born again i'm trying to get the
[1:15:57] scripture here
[1:15:59] saint john chapter 3 verse 1 there was a
[1:16:02] man
[1:16:02] of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler
[1:16:04] of the jews
[1:16:06] the same came to jesus by night and he
[1:16:09] said unto him rabbi
[1:16:10] most people criticize him because he
[1:16:12] came at night but you got to remember he
[1:16:13] came
[1:16:14] a lot of people don't even come they
[1:16:15] just like sit back and criticize but
[1:16:17] this man at least came to jesus
[1:16:20] and he said rabbi we know that there are
[1:16:21] a teacher come from god and no man can
[1:16:23] do these miracles that thou doest except
[1:16:25] god be with him
[1:16:26] jesus answered and said unto him verily
[1:16:28] verily
[1:16:29] so he punctuated it this is very
[1:16:31] important very very important jesus said
[1:16:33] verily verily i say unto thee except a
[1:16:35] man be born again
[1:16:37] he cannot see the kingdom of heaven he
[1:16:39] can't
[1:16:40] understand you say hey do you see that
[1:16:42] like
[1:16:43] hey don't go through that door there's
[1:16:44] spider on the floor like
[1:16:46] no you don't understand it's a tarantula
[1:16:50] it's a tarantula like oh i see him he
[1:16:53] bite me and i'll
[1:16:54] hurt me right now you understand you so
[1:16:57] jesus said except a man be born again he
[1:16:58] can't understand why those women wear
[1:17:00] dresses can't understand why a man would
[1:17:03] take a book and let that book
[1:17:05] regulate his life
[1:17:09] let me just say this do you realize
[1:17:12] in 20 years when you can't buy a book
[1:17:14] just like you can't buy a rotary phone
[1:17:17] and the bible the book is a pdf portable
[1:17:20] document file
[1:17:22] and you tell a young generation look
[1:17:23] your life has to be governed
[1:17:25] by that pdf file or you'll go to hell
[1:17:29] like that's a bunch of nonsense you see
[1:17:31] how technology and science is taken away
[1:17:34] and how that as we go on it'll become
[1:17:36] more and more difficult whereas now you
[1:17:38] have a physical bible
[1:17:39] and it represents god my friend you did
[1:17:41] some very terrible things
[1:17:43] he said i'd go to hotels and things he
[1:17:45] said but i always took the bible
[1:17:47] and i put it in the drawer out of the
[1:17:48] because it represented god
[1:17:51] i think it's so important even to have
[1:17:52] your children have the bible visible
[1:17:54] this is the word of god this isn't a
[1:17:56] newspaper this isn't
[1:17:57] a magazine this is the word of god and
[1:18:00] our lives will be judged by the word of
[1:18:02] god
[1:18:02] i think even around our message we've
[1:18:04] forgotten the power and what this word
[1:18:06] means that we're going to be judged by
[1:18:08] this word amen
[1:18:11] they asked brother random about
[1:18:12] ministers preaching twice he doesn't
[1:18:14] even answer the question he just said
[1:18:15] look he quotes timothy and titus and
[1:18:17] said there's the answer and he just
[1:18:18] moves right on from it because it's
[1:18:20] written in the scripture we're going to
[1:18:21] be judged by the scripture
[1:18:22] that's why when if something's written
[1:18:23] in the scripture and we say lord let me
[1:18:26] live the word of god how. amen lord let
[1:18:29] me live it
[1:18:30] so that jesus says except a man be born
[1:18:32] again he can't see the kingdom of god
[1:18:34] nicodemus saith unto him how can a man
[1:18:36] be
[1:18:36] born when he is old can he enter the
[1:18:38] second time into his mother's womb and
[1:18:39] be
[1:18:40] born jesus answered verily i say unto
[1:18:42] thee except a man be born of water
[1:18:45] and of spirit he cannot enter into the
[1:18:47] kingdom of god
[1:18:49] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[1:18:50] and that which is born of the spirit is
[1:18:52] spirit marvel not that i say unto you
[1:18:54] ye must it's in red right
[1:18:57] ye must be born again the wind blew us
[1:19:01] where it lists us and now here's the
[1:19:02] sound thereof but can't not tell
[1:19:04] whence it cometh or whether it goes so
[1:19:06] is everyone that is born
[1:19:08] of the spirit of god and i was listening
[1:19:10] to this
[1:19:11] message brother iran preaches the whole
[1:19:12] message and he takes the the the
[1:19:14] churches and their denominations and
[1:19:16] their everybody has an idea but
[1:19:18] the bible the word of the lord comes to
[1:19:20] a prophet
[1:19:21] so he takes this subject and preaches a
[1:19:23] host sermon
[1:19:24] on this subject the prophet of god was
[1:19:26] sent in this day to clear up
[1:19:28] our ideas so we had an idea of the
[1:19:32] rapture
[1:19:33] and my minister friends they criticized
[1:19:35] me we're sitting with a bunch of
[1:19:36] brothers
[1:19:36] they're like you got this idea and they
[1:19:37] gave me a label like you're this this i
[1:19:39] don't know you
[1:19:40] label me whatever but i just lowered my
[1:19:42] voice i said hey if you brothers would
[1:19:44] go back and listen to the tape of the
[1:19:45] rapture brother and preaches for two
[1:19:46] hours on the subject of a rapture
[1:19:49] so if we're going to listen and talk
[1:19:50] about the rapture or talk about
[1:19:52] the future home or we'll talk about the
[1:19:55] holy spirit brother and preach the whole
[1:19:56] series on the holy spirit or
[1:19:58] he must be born again and he preaches a
[1:19:59] message on it
[1:20:01] brother man i just want to read a couple
[1:20:02] things here brother ram said the
[1:20:03] approach to this new
[1:20:05] new birth he said to approach it it and
[1:20:08] to be
[1:20:09] this approach this birth he said you
[1:20:11] have to go through a process
[1:20:13] just like anything that lives anything
[1:20:15] that lives again it has to die
[1:20:17] first how jesus say except the corn of
[1:20:19] wheat fall into the ground it abides
[1:20:21] alone
[1:20:21] so all of us are we are born we have a
[1:20:24] life and if it doesn't isn't born again
[1:20:26] it just dies and rots like the little
[1:20:27] grain of wheat
[1:20:29] a corn but if it goes into the ground it
[1:20:31] comes forth again
[1:20:32] so it has to die first and he said you
[1:20:35] cannot
[1:20:36] keep your same spirit you cannot keep
[1:20:37] your same habits you cannot keep your
[1:20:39] same thoughts you
[1:20:40] got to die you got to die like he died
[1:20:43] so he talked about
[1:20:44] abel how he died on the altar and cain
[1:20:47] killed him
[1:20:48] there and so i was thinking of the
[1:20:49] scripture he that is born of god is a
[1:20:51] new creature old things are passed away
[1:20:54] and all things are become new that's
[1:20:55] second corinthians chapter 5 verse 17.
[1:20:58] so all of us are born with an old nature
[1:21:01] we've been through that before
[1:21:02] but jesus said he that is born he's a
[1:21:05] new creature he's a new creation
[1:21:08] so you see people that say they're born
[1:21:10] again and then they still have that same
[1:21:11] old nature
[1:21:12] hateful mean temper dress
[1:21:15] women dress in moral clothes and cut
[1:21:17] their hair they've never been born again
[1:21:21] i don't have time to read through this
[1:21:23] whole thing brother rem said you got to
[1:21:25] die
[1:21:26] he said die how to yourself die to
[1:21:28] everything so that you can be born again
[1:21:30] you've got to do that
[1:21:32] he said if you don't die you can't never
[1:21:34] live again
[1:21:35] it's amazing because this was a new
[1:21:36] year's eve service and he said
[1:21:38] he said it's not turn a new page it's
[1:21:41] actually
[1:21:42] die and be born again you have to feel
[1:21:43] so guilty when you stand in his presence
[1:21:45] whether
[1:21:46] you go the methodist way or the baptist
[1:21:48] way or whatever way you go
[1:21:49] you got to feel so guilty and feel so
[1:21:51] guilty it'll kill you
[1:21:55] amen he said you've got to reckon
[1:21:56] yourself so guilty in the presence of
[1:21:58] god till your worldly
[1:21:59] life dies right there and the sin
[1:22:01] question is over for you when you're
[1:22:02] standing in his presence
[1:22:04] and when you look at that you're sure to
[1:22:05] live again when you're dead
[1:22:08] he said you see what i'm coming to the
[1:22:09] new birth he said first is to die in
[1:22:11] order to be born again you've still got
[1:22:13] the things of the world in you
[1:22:14] you're not born again
[1:22:18] he talks about the serpent jesus a few
[1:22:20] chapter
[1:22:21] verses down from this and he talks about
[1:22:22] the serpent as moses lifted up the
[1:22:24] serpent on the
[1:22:26] uh how was it verse 14 and moses lifted
[1:22:28] up the serpent in the wilderness even so
[1:22:30] must the son of man be lifted up
[1:22:33] and how that that serpent was made of
[1:22:34] brass which was a symbolism of
[1:22:37] the serpent in the garden which was dead
[1:22:39] and it was
[1:22:40] judged it was brass brass speaks of
[1:22:42] judgment and so
[1:22:44] brother adam is bringing this out and
[1:22:45] showing us most people don't understand
[1:22:46] why it was brass it was
[1:22:47] it was sin being judged and christ hung
[1:22:50] on a cross and he became
[1:22:52] sin for us that's what the scripture
[1:22:53] says he became sin
[1:22:55] who knew no sin amen he became he took
[1:22:59] how does he say he became sin that you
[1:23:01] might become his righteousness and so he
[1:23:03] hung on a cross and he become
[1:23:04] just as that serpent was hanging their
[1:23:06] breasts but he was crystallized there
[1:23:08] was nothing
[1:23:09] it was petrified and brother ram said
[1:23:10] that's why you have to die to your old
[1:23:12] nature and your
[1:23:13] habits and desires and that's where most
[1:23:15] people they don't want to do that
[1:23:16] they don't want to they just want to i
[1:23:18] want to raise my hand accept christ as
[1:23:19] my savior i don't want to burn in hell
[1:23:21] but that's not what jesus said except a
[1:23:23] man be born again
[1:23:24] he can't enter the kingdom of heaven
[1:23:27] jesus goes on to say
[1:23:28] he said if jesus said except a man be
[1:23:32] born of water and of spirit
[1:23:34] we had a prophet come and he interpreted
[1:23:36] these words he said being born of water
[1:23:39] is ephesians chapter 5 he said you're
[1:23:41] washed by the water of the word
[1:23:44] so being born of the water and of the
[1:23:46] spirit you have to be washed by the
[1:23:48] water of the word so it's people like oh
[1:23:49] i just want to be born again so churches
[1:23:51] have their like come up and sign the
[1:23:52] church book and put your name on the
[1:23:54] book we'll send you a letter now you're
[1:23:56] a member now you're born again
[1:23:57] but that's not what jesus said except
[1:23:59] you be born of water
[1:24:01] and of the holy spirit you can't enter
[1:24:03] the kingdom of god so you have to be
[1:24:04] willing to be washed by the water of the
[1:24:07] word
[1:24:07] so when the word says it's a shame for a
[1:24:09] woman to cut her hair you have to be
[1:24:11] washed from your ideas
[1:24:12] when the bible says it's a shame that a
[1:24:14] woman should be dressed in modest
[1:24:16] apparently say i don't want to be
[1:24:17] dressed in modest apparel
[1:24:18] i just want to run around with these
[1:24:20] leggings or whatever they are and these
[1:24:22] they're how's the bible prophesied in
[1:24:24] revelations chapter 3
[1:24:25] he said that they'll be naked it was the
[1:24:27] attribute of our age it would be naked
[1:24:30] we were driving down the road i seen a
[1:24:31] lady the other day and i said you know
[1:24:33] those leggings are nothing but skin
[1:24:35] they're naked before god it's a
[1:24:37] fulfillment of scripture
[1:24:38] if you'll look at that brothers and
[1:24:39] you'll look at that you won't be tempted
[1:24:41] by those things you'll look at it and
[1:24:42] say that's the fulfillment
[1:24:44] of revelation chapter 3 the church and
[1:24:46] the last day would be naked before god
[1:24:48] and we see it it's nakedness portrayed
[1:24:50] before us
[1:24:50] may god help us to throw away our lust
[1:24:53] and be born again
[1:24:54] amen not of corruptible seed but by the
[1:24:56] word of god
[1:24:57] not by this church you're born again of
[1:24:59] the spirit of god
[1:25:01] and you're washed by the water of the
[1:25:03] word of god has nothing to do with
[1:25:05] brother daniel has nothing to do with
[1:25:06] this church it has
[1:25:08] has everything to do with you being
[1:25:10] washed by the water of the word and god
[1:25:12] coming and birthing you by the spirit of
[1:25:13] god into his kingdom
[1:25:15] and when he burst you into the kingdom
[1:25:17] no man can take you out no blessed be
[1:25:19] the name of the lord brother matthew
[1:25:20] i had so many people put me out said
[1:25:22] brother daniel you're this one brother
[1:25:24] wrote a book and they like this and like
[1:25:25] hey here's the word test you write this
[1:25:27] and
[1:25:27] you go through this and i wouldn't even
[1:25:28] have been a message believer
[1:25:31] he wrote this big thick book i thought i
[1:25:32] guess i'm not i don't believe the
[1:25:34] message well when a few years later his
[1:25:36] mind got twisted around he didn't even
[1:25:37] believe
[1:25:37] the the source of the book that he wrote
[1:25:40] and he left the message and everything
[1:25:42] i tell you i don't want to you know the
[1:25:44] world or nobody in this message put me
[1:25:46] into this thing jesus christ came and he
[1:25:48] found me one day
[1:25:49] when i was going my way and i was doing
[1:25:51] my thing and i was just not a good
[1:25:53] person
[1:25:54] he came and he found me amen and he
[1:25:56] delivered me and he set me free when i
[1:25:58] tried to reform myself
[1:25:59] he birthed me into a kingdom of god and
[1:26:01] the habits and desires and he
[1:26:03] broke those things from my life and
[1:26:04] he'll do the same for you today
[1:26:07] this is not a theory this is a
[1:26:09] resurrected jesus christ
[1:26:11] coming back and dealing with people's
[1:26:13] life he said i've come that you might
[1:26:14] have life
[1:26:15] and you might have it more abundantly
[1:26:17] you don't have to be addicted to those
[1:26:18] things
[1:26:19] you can be free and he that the sun sets
[1:26:21] free he's free indeed
[1:26:23] oh so good to be a christian today amen
[1:26:27] amen brother man said people want
[1:26:29] shortcuts he said there's no shortcuts
[1:26:31] he said you have to come the way of
[1:26:33] calvary
[1:26:34] he said you have to come the way of the
[1:26:36] brass altar you have to come the way of
[1:26:37] the brazen serpent you die you actually
[1:26:39] die oh god
[1:26:41] if i can't say it right you die
[1:26:42] literally you die to yourself you die to
[1:26:44] the things of the world and are born
[1:26:46] anew
[1:26:47] amen no things of the world no world the
[1:26:50] things of the world is dead no shortcuts
[1:26:52] they want to come quickly
[1:26:53] listen this is so amazing brother i was
[1:26:55] talking about people wanting to come
[1:26:56] quickly it's like the magic one religion
[1:26:58] i come and say except jesus and we wave
[1:27:00] a wan over you and you're a christian
[1:27:02] no you have to die to your own self
[1:27:05] jesus said he that is not willing to
[1:27:06] come
[1:27:07] and take up his cross and follow me is
[1:27:09] not worthy to be my disciple my wife
[1:27:11] sent me that verse this morning i don't
[1:27:12] have my phone phone she texted to me
[1:27:14] and he says deny himself and take up his
[1:27:17] cross
[1:27:18] see i got a right brother daniel this is
[1:27:20] i can do whatever i want
[1:27:22] yes you're right you can do it but jesus
[1:27:24] said if you won't come and deny yourself
[1:27:27] and take up your cross and and deny your
[1:27:30] all of your
[1:27:31] ideas and take up the word of god he
[1:27:32] said you're not worthy to be my disciple
[1:27:35] now do you see why jesus said straight
[1:27:36] is the gate
[1:27:38] narrow is the way and very few people in
[1:27:41] lady ocean will be willing
[1:27:43] to lay down their own ideas in their own
[1:27:45] life and take up their cross
[1:27:47] and follow the lord jesus christ amen
[1:27:49] but i feel something calling me this
[1:27:51] morning
[1:27:52] amen something it's not me because it's
[1:27:55] not natural it's supernatural or
[1:27:56] something comes inside of me
[1:27:58] remember when they were crucifying
[1:27:59] christ they said we will not have this
[1:28:01] man to rule over us and what is christ
[1:28:04] he is the word of god
[1:28:06] you see how the people the religious
[1:28:07] people were the ones persecuting christ
[1:28:10] trying to kill the word of god and they
[1:28:12] say we will not have the word of
[1:28:14] god rule over us i'm not going to have
[1:28:16] that book tell me how to dress
[1:28:18] i'm not going to have that book tell me
[1:28:20] how to run my life
[1:28:21] but there's a group of people said i
[1:28:23] want the word of god to rule over me
[1:28:25] hey man i want that i mean the bride has
[1:28:27] made herself ready
[1:28:29] i mean she says lord that is your word i
[1:28:31] want to live by the word of god
[1:28:33] there is a select group of people that
[1:28:35] say lord i want your word to rule over
[1:28:37] me i know i'm going to be judged by it
[1:28:39] and you'll be either be judged today or
[1:28:41] you'll be judged as a great white throne
[1:28:42] judgment
[1:28:43] the bible says some men's sins go before
[1:28:45] and they say god forgive me they go
[1:28:47] before and they're forgiven
[1:28:48] or they come afterward they're saying
[1:28:50] lord i am lord have we
[1:28:51] cast out devils in your name we've done
[1:28:53] many mighty works and then he said hey
[1:28:54] bring that bring the record of their
[1:28:56] life they bring them up
[1:28:57] now right here you sat in a church and
[1:28:59] we told you to be baptized in jesus name
[1:29:01] and you were baptized in father son and
[1:29:03] holy spirit never were baptized in the
[1:29:05] name of jesus christ he said depart from
[1:29:06] me
[1:29:07] you worker of iniquity i never knew you
[1:29:09] you knew it was right no one was
[1:29:11] baptizing father son and holy spirit
[1:29:13] they were all baptized in the name of
[1:29:14] jesus christ
[1:29:16] i love the lord don't you sometimes i
[1:29:19] talk fast as i'm so passionate about the
[1:29:22] word of god
[1:29:25] brother rem says it's so amazing he said
[1:29:28] they want shortcuts they want to grow up
[1:29:30] quick and they don't want to grow he
[1:29:31] said you grow in the lord it takes
[1:29:33] growth and experience he said when
[1:29:35] you're born again god vindicates you
[1:29:37] that's how god vindicates all his nature
[1:29:40] is by their fruits
[1:29:42] people like oh i made a commitment to
[1:29:44] god i said praise the lord you just keep
[1:29:46] pressing on and you know how we'll know
[1:29:47] if god really did something for you
[1:29:49] by your fruits they're fruits you'll
[1:29:52] know them
[1:29:53] see people's like oh i love jesus and
[1:29:54] then they go out and never have a change
[1:29:56] they cuss and live and do
[1:29:58] they've never been washed by the water
[1:29:59] of the word because the bible says let
[1:30:02] no filthy communication
[1:30:03] proceed from your mouth so brother
[1:30:05] daniel you're just making i could never
[1:30:06] do that oh praise the lord
[1:30:08] then you're the perfect candidate to be
[1:30:10] born of the spirit of god
[1:30:12] because i nobody in this room can do it
[1:30:15] it takes the holy spirit
[1:30:17] jesus said i'm not going to leave you
[1:30:18] comfortless peter i'm not going to leave
[1:30:20] you out there as a custom preacher i'm
[1:30:21] going to come to you
[1:30:22] i'll be with you i'll be inside of you
[1:30:26] how paul said the life that i now live i
[1:30:28] live by the faith of the son of god that
[1:30:30] died and gave himself for me
[1:30:32] i tell you if you're living overcoming
[1:30:33] life you can truly say it's not by power
[1:30:35] it's not by might it's by the spirit of
[1:30:37] god
[1:30:37] that's what all of us need to do just
[1:30:39] say lord take me lord i want to be
[1:30:41] washed by the water of the word lord
[1:30:42] take every desire that's not like you
[1:30:44] lord and wash it clean my mind
[1:30:46] and let the holy spirit come and fill my
[1:30:48] life amen the bible says he seeks to and
[1:30:50] fro over the earth to find anybody that
[1:30:52] will find that'll
[1:30:53] open their heart up how we revelation
[1:30:55] chapter three if any man hear my voice
[1:30:57] and we'll open the door i'll come into
[1:30:58] him and sup with them
[1:31:00] oh isn't such an amazing promise of god
[1:31:02] maybe you're
[1:31:03] living alone maybe maybe you're older
[1:31:05] and you just have your house and you
[1:31:06] have a scripture
[1:31:08] and the bible says if you'll hear the
[1:31:09] voice of god and you open your door
[1:31:12] you know we we have these i don't know
[1:31:13] metaphors are hard to open it
[1:31:15] but sometimes it's good to just open the
[1:31:17] door of your house and open it say
[1:31:18] jesus will you come into my house
[1:31:22] sometimes when i preach i'd like to get
[1:31:23] a silhouette one of those cardboard
[1:31:25] cutouts they do it of trump and those
[1:31:27] they're
[1:31:27] i like to cut one of jesus and have him
[1:31:29] just stand there and then when i read
[1:31:31] his word
[1:31:31] he can't say it because he has no lips
[1:31:33] but my lips but you could look at him
[1:31:35] and said
[1:31:35] jesus wrote that jesus wrote that and it
[1:31:39] bring a visibility before us
[1:31:41] amen may god help us that's why we close
[1:31:43] our eyes when you pray you close your
[1:31:45] eyes and it shuts all the world out and
[1:31:46] you're just alone with the lord jesus
[1:31:50] amen we're not getting very far in this
[1:31:52] subject are we
[1:31:55] he that is born of god is a new creature
[1:31:57] old things are passed away and
[1:31:58] everything's become new
[1:32:01] they asked him in acts 2 said how do i
[1:32:03] get saved he said repent and be baptized
[1:32:05] every one of you in the name of jesus
[1:32:07] christ for the remission of your sins
[1:32:09] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:32:10] holy spirit
[1:32:12] i mean you know sometimes we just run
[1:32:14] through life and
[1:32:15] even come to church and just hear it but
[1:32:16] we don't really hear it sometimes it's
[1:32:19] better not to scream it's just to slow
[1:32:20] down and say am i really hearing what
[1:32:22] that man says
[1:32:23] god i want to be washed by the water of
[1:32:25] the word lord
[1:32:27] we've got you take and say you know lord
[1:32:29] i want my home to be different
[1:32:31] i want my family to be different i want
[1:32:33] my bad attitude lord wash that bad
[1:32:35] attitude away
[1:32:36] maybe we get a self-righteous spirit
[1:32:39] jesus
[1:32:40] he came to seek and to save that which
[1:32:42] was lost
[1:32:44] one time they drug a woman and say look
[1:32:46] we've caught a right in the very act of
[1:32:47] adultery we caught her right in the very
[1:32:49] act of adultery
[1:32:51] i don't know if we've been through this
[1:32:52] before the holy spirit just brings me
[1:32:54] right to this
[1:32:55] point here say we've got her and our law
[1:32:58] says the stoner
[1:33:00] and the bible says jesus said no you
[1:33:02] just begin to write
[1:33:04] it doesn't say what he wrote but it said
[1:33:06] when they observed what he was writing
[1:33:08] they just
[1:33:08] everyone dropped their stone and turned
[1:33:10] and walked away
[1:33:12] we got a little plaque in our house it
[1:33:14] says drop the stone
[1:33:16] drop the stone so it's so easy to pick
[1:33:19] up a stone and jesus said
[1:33:21] any one of you that's without sin
[1:33:24] you pick up your stone and you throw it
[1:33:26] first and then they all walked away
[1:33:30] and jesus said where are your accusers
[1:33:31] she said i have none lord
[1:33:35] you know people don't realize that
[1:33:36] there's a place of repentance that every
[1:33:38] person can come to
[1:33:41] we don't you know we confess our sins to
[1:33:43] god and he forgives us and he forgets it
[1:33:45] he doesn't remember it's the one to see
[1:33:47] if his forgetfulness
[1:33:48] we don't have that ability because we're
[1:33:50] human we say oh yeah god will forgive
[1:33:52] you then we remember that
[1:33:54] but we must remember that when this lady
[1:33:56] comes somewhere between being caught in
[1:33:58] an
[1:33:58] act of adultery i want to just stop
[1:34:00] right there because there's been a lot
[1:34:02] of discussion why jesus didn't stone her
[1:34:03] because he said i didn't come to destroy
[1:34:05] the law i came to fulfill it right
[1:34:07] so why didn't jesus tell have her stone
[1:34:10] well everybody's got their opinion my
[1:34:12] opinion is they caught him in the very
[1:34:13] act so they had the man
[1:34:14] right the law said they had to bring the
[1:34:17] man and the
[1:34:18] woman together so who really broke the
[1:34:21] law
[1:34:22] they did by not bringing the man and the
[1:34:24] woman so jesus
[1:34:25] couldn't fulfill have the woman stone
[1:34:27] because that the law was that they
[1:34:28] brought both of them and they stoned
[1:34:29] them both
[1:34:30] so jesus would have actually been
[1:34:31] breaking the law if he said look stone
[1:34:33] the woman how many understand that
[1:34:34] so he said where you're accused you said
[1:34:36] i have none lord somewhere between
[1:34:38] that they catching her and bringing her
[1:34:40] that place she found a place to repent
[1:34:43] and she i don't know where it was maybe
[1:34:45] it's when she heard the name we're
[1:34:46] dragging you to jesus and she thought
[1:34:48] you know
[1:34:49] i remember jesus he's the one that
[1:34:51] touched the woman at the well
[1:34:53] maybe we went to the well together down
[1:34:55] there and i and and she was delivered
[1:34:56] and god forgave her she had five
[1:34:58] husbands and
[1:34:59] maybe somewhere said oh god would you
[1:35:01] forgive me too
[1:35:03] and when they got right to the place and
[1:35:04] they had their stones and he said well
[1:35:06] where
[1:35:07] why don't you cast the first stone if
[1:35:08] you've never made a mistake in your life
[1:35:10] sometimes adults get to that place and
[1:35:12] like man especially young people we deal
[1:35:14] with a lot
[1:35:15] a lot of young people like parents like
[1:35:17] this and this is going on at church and
[1:35:18] asking this girl cut her hair and yeah
[1:35:20] i stopped like wait wait wait just a
[1:35:22] minute what were you
[1:35:23] doing when you were 15 years old
[1:35:27] oh we were just out in the world running
[1:35:28] around smoking dope and getting drunk
[1:35:29] and running
[1:35:30] living like this like wait a minute
[1:35:32] these kids are making
[1:35:33] trying to make a step for christ trying
[1:35:36] to do something and
[1:35:37] when you stand up and say i'm a
[1:35:38] christian you get baptized every gun in
[1:35:40] hell is pointed at you just like our
[1:35:42] brother joseph he made a stand and got
[1:35:43] baptized the devil said look i'll put
[1:35:45] him through a trial we'll see
[1:35:46] every son that comes to god must be
[1:35:48] tested and tried
[1:35:50] and when you play stand up and say i'm a
[1:35:52] christian and you raise your hand say
[1:35:53] lord i'm going to start doing
[1:35:55] watch the devil come after you make you
[1:35:57] prove what you've made
[1:35:58] a confession for christ you make a step
[1:36:00] and the devil's going to fight you
[1:36:03] oh but jesus said greater is he that is
[1:36:05] in you than he that is in the world
[1:36:07] amen that little faith that something
[1:36:09] that you believe on the lord jesus
[1:36:10] christ that you shall be saved there's
[1:36:12] some that
[1:36:13] faith is greater amen paul said the life
[1:36:16] that i now live i live by the faith of
[1:36:18] the son of god
[1:36:19] he says in another place he said the
[1:36:21] power that doth work in you it's the
[1:36:23] faith of jesus
[1:36:24] it's not your faith it's his faith
[1:36:27] maybe even in your family god doesn't he
[1:36:28] give everybody
[1:36:30] but he's given you a desire for god
[1:36:33] the son of man came to seek and to save
[1:36:35] that which was lost so you're sitting
[1:36:36] here today
[1:36:37] for a reason this is this is what i
[1:36:39] believe peter when it says the bible
[1:36:40] says work out your own salvation
[1:36:43] and you realize where's the rest of my
[1:36:45] family where's people that are better
[1:36:46] why aren't they why don't they have it
[1:36:48] but god's given you a desire for god
[1:36:51] he's given you a desire for god and
[1:36:53] jesus said
[1:36:54] how do you say it over there he said
[1:36:55] i've i've ordained you you have not
[1:36:57] chosen me but i have chosen you and
[1:36:59] ordained you that you go and bear fruit
[1:37:01] and we we went through that on on was it
[1:37:04] wednesday how
[1:37:05] as many uh those that bear fruit he said
[1:37:07] i'm going to prune it i'm the vine year
[1:37:09] the branches
[1:37:10] the the branch that brings forth fruit
[1:37:11] he said i prune it
[1:37:13] that it might bring forth more fruit
[1:37:16] well i'm trying brother daniel but god
[1:37:18] wants to prune more things away from you
[1:37:20] you'll bring more of a fruit and more of
[1:37:22] a testimony and others will see it and
[1:37:23] say
[1:37:24] how do you say it i will dangerous you
[1:37:25] go and bear fruit and that they would
[1:37:27] glorify your father which is in heaven
[1:37:29] not that we get the glory it's jesus
[1:37:31] christ that wants the glory
[1:37:34] amen i've got so many things here
[1:37:37] but i don't think we're going to get to
[1:37:38] all of it today
[1:37:40] i say lord i want to be born again
[1:37:44] not just of tucson tabernacle's idea not
[1:37:47] even a brother daniel's idea
[1:37:49] but lord i want to be washed by the
[1:37:51] water of the word of god
[1:37:53] i want the word of god to wash me and
[1:37:55] wash my mind and that bad attitude and
[1:37:57] that unforgiving
[1:37:58] and that self-righteous spirit and
[1:38:00] religious spirit i want all of it gone
[1:38:01] lord i want to be
[1:38:02] born again not of corruptible seed but i
[1:38:04] want to be born again by the word of god
[1:38:07] and lord i want the spirit of god to
[1:38:09] come and live inside of me
[1:38:11] that's not an arrogant spirit it's not a
[1:38:13] proud spirit it's a
[1:38:14] humble holy spirit amen maybe our
[1:38:17] musicians have come
[1:38:21] i've got a lot of notes
[1:38:25] you can see here they are
[1:38:30] and we've only got through a couple of
[1:38:32] them but god knows what he's doing
[1:38:35] in every one of our lives he knows every
[1:38:38] tear that you've cried he knows every
[1:38:40] heartache every pain that you have
[1:38:42] i see our brother and sister back there
[1:38:44] they're aged
[1:38:45] but god knows them he knows their name
[1:38:48] he knows all about them
[1:38:50] he knows everything about you
[1:38:54] i love the lord jesus like that i want
[1:38:57] to serve him
[1:38:58] i mean this thing is a lot bigger than
[1:39:00] me but he's got it all in control as
[1:39:02] that little song says he's got it all in
[1:39:04] control
[1:39:05] he's got all of this in control before
[1:39:07] you ever came into the world
[1:39:09] before you made your first sin two
[1:39:11] thousand years ago he died on the cross
[1:39:13] he knew that you would be a sinner
[1:39:16] and he made a way and as if we went
[1:39:20] through it before
[1:39:21] the bible says he's wounded for our
[1:39:22] transgressions and he was bruised for
[1:39:25] your iniquities
[1:39:26] what is iniquity it's knowing to do good
[1:39:28] and you didn't do it
[1:39:30] and he went ahead and took the bruises 2
[1:39:32] 000 years ago because he knew you would
[1:39:33] do it
[1:39:35] i tell you when you have that day on
[1:39:36] calvary just makes you humble makes you
[1:39:38] want to love him
[1:39:40] maybe you're sick in your body and he
[1:39:41] said look i'm gonna go ahead and put the
[1:39:43] stripes on my back i'm gonna put a
[1:39:44] promise in there and by my stripes they
[1:39:46] can be healed
[1:39:47] it's all in that atonement of calvary
[1:39:50] we've got a cross here
[1:39:51] doesn't have jesus on it because he died
[1:39:53] and rose again
[1:39:55] he said because i live you can live also
[1:39:58] you feel that real gentle feeling how
[1:40:01] many raise your hand say i feel that
[1:40:02] brother daniel it's
[1:40:04] not something i feel in my flesh but god
[1:40:06] is a spirit and you feel that gentle
[1:40:09] timidness of the holy spirit he said the
[1:40:13] son of man came to seek and to save that
[1:40:15] which was lost he's trying to draw us to

[1:58:59] amen it's a reality it's just not a
[1:59:01] fairy tale that we're
[1:59:03] i read it over there this morning
[1:59:04] revelations 20 21 the bible says and i
[1:59:07] saw a new heaven and a
[1:59:08] new earth descending from god out of
[1:59:10] heaven you know how i know that's true
[1:59:13] because back at the first part it said
[1:59:14] he that is born of god is a new creature
[1:59:17] old things have passed away all things
[1:59:19] become new
[1:59:20] i tried to be a good person and i
[1:59:22] couldn't be a good person
[1:59:23] but i was born again by the washing of
[1:59:25] the water to the word and by the spirit
[1:59:27] of god and i became a new creature
[1:59:29] in christ jesus and if that part of the
[1:59:31] word of god is true then i believe the
[1:59:33] last part of the word of god is true
[1:59:35] christianity is just not for weak people
[1:59:37] that need a crutch of faith
[1:59:38] amen it's for strong people i know that
[1:59:40] educated i've heard it said like you
[1:59:42] christians you're a bunch of weak people
[1:59:43] need a little crutch
[1:59:45] no in noah's day there was eight people
[1:59:47] that had faith in the word of god
[1:59:49] and we still hear their names but we
[1:59:51] don't hear all those people that died
[1:59:53] and then the bible says that the
[1:59:54] righteous are going to walk out on the
[1:59:56] ashes of the wicked that's not a crutch
[1:59:57] that's using
[1:59:58] wisdom jesus said he that here at these
[2:00:01] sayings of mine and do with them is a
[2:00:02] wise man
[2:00:03] not very many wise people today amen but
[2:00:06] i want to be a wise person i want to
[2:00:08] hear the word of god
[2:00:10] amen as we go let's just let the word of
[2:00:12] god let it dwell in our heart let it
[2:00:14] speak to you
[2:00:15] amen as you go let it speak to you maybe
[2:00:17] invite your family say hey you should
[2:00:20] should feel the presence of god maybe
[2:00:22] you know somebody that's got away from
[2:00:23] god
[2:00:24] invite him to come out and feel the
[2:00:25] presence of god our brother anthony's
[2:00:27] coming
[2:00:28] uh tonight to be baptized he had to work
[2:00:30] this morning he's 18 year old boy
[2:00:32] i don't understand what bible says we
[2:00:34] read it there the wind blows where it
[2:00:35] lists us you don't know where it came
[2:00:37] from
[2:00:37] you don't know where it's going all you
[2:00:38] know the holy spirit is doing something
[2:00:41] he's doing something in our lives how
[2:00:42] many know what i'm talking about god's
[2:00:44] doing something don't sit back and try
[2:00:45] to figure out
[2:00:46] you say lord the wind blew it's blowing
[2:00:48] where it lists this young boy i don't
[2:00:49] know where he came from but
[2:00:50] he wants to be baptized let's just
[2:00:52] baptize him and let the lord lead him on
[2:00:54] in his life
[2:00:55] amen he said i don't know anything i
[2:00:56] don't know about jesus i don't know
[2:00:58] anything well that's okay
[2:00:59] god will train him amen he that is born
[2:01:02] of god god will
[2:01:03] lead him he'll guide him he'll direct us
[2:01:04] and that's way in every one of our life
[2:01:06] he knows just
[2:01:07] exactly who you are he knows your
[2:01:09] children he'll guide and direct every
[2:01:10] situation of life if we'll surrender our
[2:01:12] lives to him
[2:01:14] now you can be like samson and just get
[2:01:16] it in your head i'm gonna go and i'm
[2:01:17] gonna do this well
[2:01:18] that's okay but if you're a child of god
[2:01:20] you're gonna come back and you might be
[2:01:22] grinding at the mill of alimony paying
[2:01:24] child support and you're like you know
[2:01:25] what i didn't have to be doing this i
[2:01:27] could have been doing what's right but
[2:01:28] that's all right god found samson
[2:01:30] you come back and he said lord remember
[2:01:32] me avenge me lord use my strength and
[2:01:35] more died in his
[2:01:36] death with the testimony than he did in
[2:01:37] his whole life
[2:01:39] so you might make mistakes don't let
[2:01:40] that be the end just come back
[2:01:42] remember zacchaeus he come jesus called
[2:01:44] him out of the tree he said right now
[2:01:45] lord
