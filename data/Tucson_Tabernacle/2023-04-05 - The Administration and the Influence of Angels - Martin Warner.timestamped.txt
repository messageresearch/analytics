[4:30] tell my trophies at last
[4:58] just play that quietly
[5:01] to realize that and it was interesting
[5:04] the last two days
[5:06] two quotes that I read that somebody
[5:07] sent
[5:09] it's not what you've done
[5:12] but what he did for you
[5:15] and I thought because I was just
[5:16] mentioning that as we were praying
[5:18] together
[5:19] come out and sister Lily's playing this
[5:21] song about The Old Rugged Cross
[5:24] what he's done for us
[5:26] this is the week that commemorates we
[5:29] remember what he went through
[5:32] but he did it willingly
[5:35] amen
[5:37] brother Paul Murray would you come up
[5:40] and open in prayer if we'll stand
[5:43] to think that he would go through it he
[5:46] would say
[5:47] not my will father but thy will be done
[5:51] you know and it doesn't take him a long
[5:53] time to take care of it
[5:56] maybe it seems like for some of us it
[5:58] has been a long time
[6:00] but to a thief on the cross who at the
[6:02] last moment said remember me when you
[6:04] come into your kingdom he just turned to
[6:07] him and said this day he'll be so
[6:10] nothing is impossible for him

[24:53] my brother Aaron was just singing the
[24:56] love of God I uh I never went to church
[25:00] when I was when I was a kid
[25:02] and when I got to be about Daniel's age
[25:04] maybe a little bit younger we started
[25:06] going to brother Marconi's Church
[25:09] and I had heard brother Branham
[25:13] quote that
[25:15] um that poem
[25:18] and when I heard we were in a song
[25:20] service and like I said I had just
[25:22] started to church not too long before
[25:25] and brother Chuck Lavin sang that song
[25:29] and I got blessed brother Jonathan and I
[25:33] started clapping and I scared the I
[25:37] scared the life out of the people around
[25:38] me and I didn't really know what had
[25:40] happened I was just I was so happy and
[25:43] just and just praising the Lord and and
[25:46] um
[25:47] his song still means it still brings out

[32:42] somebody like this and he's strung out
[32:45] on meth and he told me he was taking the
[32:47] fentanyl the the really bad one told me

[32:56] I was praying
[32:57] and I just sent out that WhatsApp
[33:01] um and I read this scripture and as I
[33:04] was praying this scripture came to my
[33:07] mind
[33:08] and I felt like the Lord said Do you
[33:09] believe what you sent out to the people
[33:13] for verily I say unto you
[33:15] that whosoever shall say unto this
[33:18] mountain
[33:19] be thou removed and be cast into the sea
[33:22] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[33:25] shall believe that those things which he
[33:27] saith shall come to pass he shall have
[33:30] whatsoever he saith amen the words of
[33:34] our Lord Jesus that came back and I said
[33:36] Lord I claim that man in the name of
[33:38] Jesus Christ
[33:41] we have a couple prayer requests
[33:45] let's let's stand as as I read them
[33:49] first
[33:50] brother Glenn
[33:57] says this
[34:00] he says I truly want to thank everyone
[34:02] for their prayers
[34:04] the biopsy is still being worked on and
[34:07] I have not yet gotten the results the
[34:09] results are due at any time now
[34:12] I ask for your prayers and your Church's
[34:14] prayers for the results to be negative
[34:17] for cancer
[34:18] I'm praying that is as a benign cyst
[34:21] that can be drained and then removed
[34:23] without any problems of course if the
[34:26] Lord wanted to remove it without any
[34:28] type of surgery or or any more treatment
[34:30] that wouldn't bother me at all either
[34:33] again I am most thankful
[34:36] for the prayers to this point and ask
[34:39] for them to still go forward
[34:42] I know that there are many needs in all
[34:45] the assemblies as I've listened in on
[34:47] the various services online I've been
[34:48] praying for the people that have
[34:50] requested prayers well
[34:52] where one can put it a thousand to fight
[34:55] to flight
[34:56] [Music]
[34:58] where one can put one thousand to flight
[35:02] one can put ten thousand to flight and
[35:04] threefold court is not easily broken
[35:06] God bless you and thank you all I will
[35:09] keep you updated brother Glenn Tomlinson

[35:28] you had something upon your heart
[35:30] if you'd raise your hand
[35:32] in the name of the Lord Jesus
[35:36] Heavenly Father you see these hands
[35:40] Lord God you know the secrets of the
[35:42] heart
[35:44] we bring these requests before you in
[35:47] the name of Jesus Christ
[35:49] and ask Lord that you would meet every
[35:52] need
[35:54] that you would Grant these requests and
[35:56] Lord as I read out of the Book of Mark
[35:58] the words of our Lord Jesus we claim
[36:01] those
[36:03] and we believe them
[36:05] [Music]
[36:06] Lord we claim these things that we've
[36:09] asked in Jesus Christ's name
[36:11] amen God bless you all
[36:15] again
[36:17] but then if he'd help me sing Amazing
[36:18] Grace again we have the the blessing of
[36:21] our brother martin here to minister for
[36:25] us
[36:27] I'd like to welcome my brother God bless

[39:48] with verse 6.
[39:51] Hebrews chapter one
[39:55] I don't know how far we'll get with this
[39:57] tonight I I know it's a Wednesday night
[39:59] but I'd like to try to get to something
[40:01] here that you can take home
[40:03] amen and you can just ponder it and go
[40:06] through the scripture and go through the
[40:08] message and just comb it out yourself
[40:11] he was chapter 1 verse 6 and again when
[40:15] he said when he bringeth in the first
[40:17] begotten into the world he saith and let
[40:19] all the angels of God worship Him
[40:22] and of the angels He saith who maketh
[40:25] his angels spirits and his ministers a
[40:28] flame of fire
[40:30] verse 13 but to which of the Angels said
[40:33] he at any time sit on my right hand
[40:35] until I make thy enemies thy footstool
[40:38] are they not all ministering Spirits
[40:41] sent forth to minister
[40:43] for them who shall have be The Heirs of
[40:46] Salvation speaking about Paul speaking
[40:49] about angels
[40:50] Isaiah chapter 6
[40:52] familiar scripture to all of us I got a
[40:54] little bit of a rebound
[40:56] up here Brothers
[41:00] he Isaiah chapter six that's better
[41:03] verse 1.
[41:06] in the year that King Uzziah died I saw
[41:09] the Lord sitting upon a throne high and
[41:11] lifted up and his train filled the
[41:13] temple and the prophet said what is his
[41:16] train
[41:17] that's the angels
[41:20] that was the Lord's train that was
[41:24] following behind him I thought that was
[41:26] so amazing
[41:27] above it stood the seraphim each one had
[41:29] six wings with Twain he covered his face
[41:31] with Twain he covered his feet between
[41:33] he did fly and one cried onto another
[41:35] said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts
[41:39] the whole earth is full of his glory
[41:42] and the post of the door moved at the
[41:44] voice of him that cried and the house
[41:46] was filled with smoke
[41:48] amen that was an awesome presence
[41:51] amen and then said I
[41:53] woe is me for I am undone because I'm a
[41:57] man of unclean lips and I dwell in the
[42:00] midst of a people of unclean lips for
[42:02] mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of
[42:05] hosts
[42:06] then flew one of the seraphims unto me
[42:08] having a live coal in his hand which he
[42:11] had taken with the tongues from off the
[42:13] altar
[42:14] and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo
[42:16] this has touched thy lips thine iniquity
[42:18] is taken away and thy sin is purged amen
[42:21] God would to God that he did that
[42:23] tonight
[42:24] take a coal from off the Altar and touch
[42:26] our lips touch our hearts
[42:29] also I heard the voice of the Lord
[42:31] saying then whom shall I send and whom
[42:33] who will go for us then said I hear am I
[42:37] send me may the Lord bless his word
[42:40] tonight I wanna you may be seated take
[42:42] your seats I want to speak on a subject
[42:46] uh
[42:47] the administration
[42:50] and the influence of angels
[42:53] let's speak about angels
[42:55] amen and uh they're closer than you
[42:58] think
[43:01] and we just want to comb through a
[43:03] little bit of the message and lay a
[43:06] little foundation in that tonight and
[43:09] uh you know as a I I do home inspections
[43:12] I took that
[43:15] certification also I do home inspections
[43:17] and you know if you look at a foundation
[43:21] or a slab that that's cracked and a lot
[43:24] of people will ask me well what's you
[43:26] know is it a poor concrete mix was it
[43:29] the cement or was it you know uh the
[43:32] product itself I said you know a lot of
[43:35] times it's not and sometimes it is but a
[43:37] lot of times it's not it's the it's the
[43:40] base preparation
[43:42] it's the compaction
[43:44] when you're laying that slab brother
[43:46] Daniel they're putting your house on
[43:47] there they wanna you wanna compact that
[43:50] you're gonna have the right gravel the
[43:51] right sand so that's part of the
[43:54] foundation we just look at the at the
[43:57] concrete and say well that's the
[43:58] foundation but it can have a lot of
[44:00] cracks in it
[44:01] and it's because something wasn't
[44:03] prepared right
[44:05] something wasn't done right
[44:07] amen and that's the way it is with the
[44:09] building of God Paul said I as a master
[44:12] builder I have laid the foundation
[44:15] and another bill that they're on Amen so
[44:18] and he said take heed how you build but
[44:21] that Foundation was laid by the apostles
[44:24] and Prophets
[44:25] amen and we've got to stick with that
[44:28] you stay with that word right and that's
[44:31] why the prophet said I preached
[44:32] everything Paul preached
[44:34] so he had that we have that Foundation
[44:38] wonderful isn't it we have that Solid
[44:41] Rock foundation and uh
[44:44] you know I was I was thinking about
[44:46] these seraphims uh in in Isaiah
[44:49] here the holy crying holy holy holy unto
[44:53] the Lord you know they were not they
[44:55] were not just the angels and the
[44:57] seraphims and uh all these Angels were
[45:00] not just robots
[45:03] you know Satan had deceived a third of
[45:06] them
[45:08] so they had a choice
[45:10] they had some kind of choice
[45:13] they made a decision just like we have a
[45:16] have a choice
[45:17] we can go with the word we can stay with
[45:19] the word or we can go off the word
[45:22] we can follow popularity we can be pop
[45:24] the most popular preacher in the message
[45:27] and what would that good what that do us
[45:29] tonight
[45:31] nothing amen not a not a thing it
[45:34] wouldn't it means nothing to God
[45:37] hey man who's who's the most popular
[45:40] you know it God doesn't look at that so
[45:42] you know these seraphims I was thinking
[45:45] about them there's you know different
[45:47] orders of angels we might get into that
[45:48] a little bit but what I'm proposing to
[45:50] you tonight is we're at another Junction
[45:53] of time
[45:54] uh where we have been you know leaning
[45:57] like Isaiah on the arm of Flesh
[46:01] for many years
[46:02] we've been leaving leaning on strong man
[46:06] personalities
[46:07] in the message you know or favorite
[46:09] preachers nothing wrong with that in
[46:12] itself but your your foundation and then
[46:15] you start building you're getting
[46:17] getting off the foundation
[46:19] you're going to stay with the foundation
[46:21] and how how Paul laid it out in the
[46:25] scripture for us so what I'm proposing
[46:27] is that we've been leading on air of
[46:29] Flesh and you know sometimes preachers
[46:31] and uh you know a lot of them sometimes
[46:35] we you know we don't we give them credit
[46:37] but you know that's not they've run
[46:41] their race
[46:42] they've they've run their race they've
[46:45] finished their race they've finished
[46:46] their course
[46:47] and and they've done what they're
[46:49] supposed to do
[46:50] right but now we can't lean on that like
[46:53] Isaiah or Uzziah he was leaning on the
[46:56] arm of the king
[46:58] Isaiah was leaning on the arm of of
[47:00] Uzziah the king
[47:02] so you know there comes a point when God
[47:04] will cut that off
[47:06] and we're still here
[47:09] and we're still here so you know we got
[47:12] to pick up on that where where are we at
[47:15] what what time is it sirs
[47:18] brother sister what time is it
[47:21] how late is it if it was that late then
[47:23] so that's what I'm proposing we're at a
[47:26] junction of time where we're changing
[47:28] the prophet said in the message Rapture
[47:30] we're changing dispensations
[47:33] and it's quickly changing
[47:36] so you know there's more uh
[47:39] more I could say about Uzziah you know
[47:41] as in that respect leaning Isaiah
[47:45] leaning that King had done many things
[47:47] because I had done many good things
[47:51] but he tried to take a preacher's place
[47:54] right he got out of his position see and
[47:57] you could you can never take the place
[48:00] of the Holy Ghost
[48:01] no man amen and you know you can never
[48:04] take the place of Holy Ghost leadership
[48:06] and that's what that's what uh Isaiah
[48:09] needed
[48:10] he needed his own leadership
[48:14] right he had to take the leadership
[48:16] himself because he was leaning the
[48:18] prophet said
[48:19] on on the arm of of the king so you know
[48:23] the Sons and Daughters of God are led by
[48:25] the spirit of God that's what we want we
[48:26] want Holy Ghost leadership not man's
[48:29] leadership
[48:30] can I hear an amen
[48:32] the prophets and the church we don't
[48:34] want man's leadership
[48:36] we don't even want brother branham's
[48:37] leadership we want the Holy Ghost
[48:39] leadership
[48:41] amen so you know I'm not much for church
[48:43] Spirits you know National Spirits or you
[48:46] know I travel a little bit so you know I
[48:48] know there's German Spirits there's
[48:50] Canadian Spirits there's American
[48:52] Spirits there's African spirits and
[48:55] we're not Canadians we're not Americans
[48:57] we're not Africans we're Christians
[48:59] Hallelujah that's what we are we're
[49:03] Christians and that means to be
[49:05] christ-like
[49:07] hey man sometimes we take on the net the
[49:10] national spirit
[49:11] and just like the prophet said about
[49:13] America it's just like you know someone
[49:15] walking through the the graveyard
[49:17] laughing making jokes
[49:20] playing rock and roll music while
[49:21] they're doing it
[49:23] and listening to some ungodly thing
[49:25] which was back then our Audrey godford
[49:28] or whatever his name was and all those
[49:30] comedians
[49:32] you know that was the American Spirit
[49:36] but that's not that that's not what
[49:38] we're we're based on that's not our
[49:40] foundation
[49:42] amen this nation was based on freedom of
[49:44] religion that and we and we we stand
[49:47] behind that
[49:48] but you know it's too late now
[49:52] the nations are gone
[49:54] the prophet said I don't pray for
[49:56] America
[49:58] come on now Thanksgiving amen he said I
[50:01] don't pray for Mary I don't pray for the
[50:03] Ukraine
[50:06] I don't pray for the Ukraine I pray for
[50:08] the bride in Ukraine
[50:10] that's the ones God's looking for
[50:12] amen there's 144 000 going to come out
[50:14] of Israel that's the elect
[50:17] the rest are secular
[50:19] and and ungodly
[50:22] and there'll even be homosexualities
[50:24] there
[50:25] right in their politics
[50:27] their politics are just as corrupt as we
[50:30] are
[50:31] amen I'm getting a little you know I'm
[50:33] just going to get into the word tonight
[50:34] Saints
[50:36] I mean this is not I'm not going to try
[50:37] to butter it or you know put uh gloves
[50:41] on
[50:42] time to take the gloves off amen and
[50:45] know where we stand amen and and this is
[50:48] what we we pick up on the mission field
[50:49] you see these things you know you see
[50:52] people trying to take their culture and
[50:55] fit it in the message
[50:58] or make the message fit their culture
[51:02] ah you know you got to hit that thing
[51:05] you know that's that's not
[51:07] that's not message that's not Bible
[51:11] amen you know it's not about our culture
[51:14] it's not about our upbringing you know
[51:17] it's a word culture it's a word language
[51:20] we know amen as a bride so we see Isaiah
[51:23] he was a he was at that time he was a
[51:26] baby prophet
[51:29] amen
[51:30] he was just he had to come down to the
[51:33] altar to pray
[51:35] he had to go down on his knees he had to
[51:37] Humble himself he had to get in the
[51:40] presence of God himself and be
[51:42] influenced by angels
[51:45] amen that's what we need tonight
[51:49] we need to be influenced by angels
[51:52] amen Hebrews 2 I didn't read it but
[51:56] I'll pick it up uh Hebrews 2 chapter 2
[52:01] verse 1. therefore we ought to give the
[52:03] more Earnest heed to the things that we
[52:05] have heard less at any time we should
[52:07] let them slip and if you ever seen it
[52:10] slipping it's now
[52:12] things are slipping I mean people don't
[52:16] even go to church
[52:19] forsaking the assembling of themselves
[52:22] amen
[52:24] as the manner of some is but for if the
[52:27] word spoken by Angels was steadfast and
[52:30] every transgression and Disobedience
[52:33] received a just recompense of the reward
[52:37] will we will reap what we sow
[52:40] you stay at a church for a while you'll
[52:42] backslide
[52:43] you'll backslide you'll get lukewarm
[52:46] you know and and everything else starts
[52:49] to fall apart
[52:52] for if the word spoken by angels and the
[52:54] prophet said angels He said Prophets
[52:57] Messengers
[53:00] if the word spoken by the prophet and
[53:02] this day was steadfast and all the other
[53:06] Messengers was steadfast how shall we
[53:09] escape if we neglect such a great
[53:12] salvation
[53:13] amen you know the prophet said God help
[53:17] that man that walks away from this
[53:19] message
[53:20] God help them they'll be the most
[53:22] disappointed not the judgment
[53:26] isn't that true amen that's the truth
[53:29] amen it won't be the sinner it won't be
[53:32] the prostitute it won't be the the drug
[53:34] addict it will be them that walked away
[53:37] that were right at the doorstep
[53:40] right in the prophet's meetings
[53:43] some of them preached a message for 30
[53:46] years 40 years and then walk away
[53:50] yeah you know they'll be disappointed
[53:54] disa you talk about disappointments at
[53:57] the Judgment so this Prophet uh Isaiah
[54:00] he had a you know if he had just humbled
[54:02] himself if he had just stayed in his
[54:04] position
[54:06] everything would have been fine
[54:08] but he died a leper
[54:11] with sin you know come come this far in
[54:15] the message and then die like that
[54:18] die in in a backslidden
[54:21] condition
[54:22] and you see it
[54:24] people are doing that
[54:26] you know and and uh it's a sad thing but
[54:29] as for me and my house
[54:32] hallelujah amen as for me I will follow
[54:36] the lord
[54:37] I will follow this message
[54:39] I will I will hang my soul on this
[54:41] message and and you know it hasn't been
[54:44] me because I've I've fallen many times
[54:47] I've made many mistakes but it hasn't
[54:49] been me it's been the grace of God and
[54:52] if God's grace is with you tonight you
[54:54] came out tonight there's something amen
[54:57] there's something
[54:58] pulling you there's something
[55:01] magnetizing you I mean you're not here
[55:04] just to just uh you know because someone
[55:06] will call you up why are you not here
[55:09] amen you're here because you want to be
[55:11] here you're here because there's
[55:13] something God has something for you
[55:15] amen and we should you know uh the
[55:18] prophet said he should have humbled
[55:19] himself you know I read one common
[55:21] commentator say there was uh there was
[55:25] about 80 priests had to go in and pull
[55:28] him out of that sanctuary
[55:32] you know it just it was you could never
[55:35] take someone else's place
[55:38] and the prophet referred to the
[55:39] businessmen
[55:41] they have no business in the pulpit
[55:43] they have no business preaching the word
[55:45] of God you've got to be called and
[55:48] you've got to know you're called
[55:50] amen and so he you know he he he got out
[55:53] of his position if he had stayed in his
[55:55] place I like to use a sports analogy
[55:58] and uh you know I I'm up in Canada we
[56:02] play hockey
[56:03] I think they were talking about it today
[56:05] they're you know with the hockey sticks
[56:06] and all that I think you got the Phoenix
[56:09] Coyotes up here and some hockey teams
[56:11] right in Arizona
[56:13] in the desert
[56:15] amen so you know the the famous guy
[56:18] there in Edmonton he's David uh McDavid
[56:22] Connor McDavid
[56:23] anybody heard of Conor McDavid oh got
[56:26] one Canadian there she's honest anyway I
[56:29] mean it's one of the he's one of the
[56:31] best in the league but you know he he's
[56:33] he's a he's a forward right he's a
[56:36] scorer
[56:37] he but he if he tried to play defense
[56:40] he'd just be out of his place
[56:43] I mean they just roll them over
[56:46] and you know it's it's like that and if
[56:49] I could use a
[56:51] a football analogy Tom Brady how many
[56:53] have heard of Tom Brady
[56:55] oh some more hands go up okay the Tampa
[56:58] Bay Buccaneers one of the best in the
[57:01] league
[57:02] right he's he he's the best but you know
[57:04] Tom Brady once in a while he'll run
[57:07] he'll run the ball and he could do that
[57:09] but you know that's dangerous
[57:11] because if they hit him there goes the
[57:14] there goes the quarterback
[57:15] right but Tom Brady you know a football
[57:18] in the in the hands of Tom Brady
[57:21] that's a big difference right and he and
[57:23] he can he can throw a long ways he's
[57:25] accurate and you know his wide receivers
[57:29] or you know they can go run a lot faster
[57:34] than Tom Brady
[57:36] his short receivers wide receivers you
[57:39] know
[57:40] Tom Brady can't run that fast
[57:42] not as fast as some of them
[57:45] so I'm using that to say you know stay
[57:48] in your position
[57:50] if you're not called to do something
[57:52] then the prophet said don't don't have
[57:54] don't do anything
[57:55] do what God calls us to do
[57:58] and what what he's blessed blesses us
[58:02] with amen so you know I I just I just
[58:05] thought of that you know uh it's it's so
[58:08] easy the prophet said to try to take
[58:11] someone else's place
[58:13] you know uh just like in the scripture
[58:15] the pro the scripture talks about
[58:18] Ephesians 4 11 there's prophets and
[58:20] pastors and teachers and Prophets
[58:22] evangelists and uh and one can't take
[58:26] the other's place
[58:27] amen
[58:30] warning than judgment but you see in the
[58:33] church
[58:34] there is a pastor and that Pastor is a
[58:37] special person he's built to where he
[58:40] can he can put up with all the fusses of
[58:44] the people
[58:46] can I hear an amen
[58:49] he's built that way
[58:52] uh you know I can't do that
[58:55] but he's felt that way
[58:58] he's a burden Bearer he's the ox of the
[59:01] team I remember brother green talking
[59:03] about the the thumb
[59:05] the short you know the the strong one
[59:07] right he can work with all the
[59:09] Ministries
[59:10] but the other ones can't work with with
[59:13] with each other
[59:15] you know but the the pastor he can work
[59:18] with all of them
[59:20] you know and and he can get over you
[59:22] know he can get over himself
[59:24] that's what we need to do brother Dan we
[59:26] need to get over ourselves sometimes
[59:28] we're so big you know so the pastor can
[59:31] do that he said he's a burdened bearer
[59:34] and brother Dan didn't tell me to preach
[59:35] on this by the way
[59:40] by the way no I you know I I don't get
[59:43] paid anymore or you know there's no no
[59:46] nothing in it for me so he's he's a man
[59:49] that can sit down somebody's got
[59:51] something against someone else sat down
[59:53] with them two families and take neither
[59:56] side
[59:59] and reason it out and bring it right
[1:00:01] back to sweetness
[1:00:04] oh brother bring it back to sweetness
[1:00:08] again
[1:00:09] we got you know we got so
[1:00:12] you know out of place and not a joint
[1:00:14] about things just little things
[1:00:17] and the pastor can bring it back in
[1:00:19] sweetness see he's a pastor he knows how
[1:00:21] to take care of things the Evangelist is
[1:00:24] special man burning like a fireball he
[1:00:26] runs into the city preach the message
[1:00:27] gets out of there and goes somewhere
[1:00:29] else he's a special man the teacher is a
[1:00:31] special man he sits under the anointing
[1:00:32] of the spirit able to take the words and
[1:00:34] put them together by the holy spirit
[1:00:36] that the pastor or evangelist could not
[1:00:38] even compare to him
[1:00:41] right and then we find the Apostle is a
[1:00:44] special man he's a Setter in order
[1:00:47] and you know the prophet said about
[1:00:49] Apostle they call them the nominational
[1:00:51] denominational realm called them
[1:00:53] missionaries but he said it's not the
[1:00:55] right name
[1:00:57] it's apostle
[1:00:58] a Setter in order
[1:01:00] not missionaries they're not you know
[1:01:02] people think missionaries people that go
[1:01:04] and build roofs and you know print books
[1:01:07] and things like that
[1:01:08] but Apostles set her in order
[1:01:12] order order why did the prophet preach
[1:01:15] conduct odor and Doctrine
[1:01:17] why is that there
[1:01:20] has to be an order
[1:01:22] there has to be a proper Foundation
[1:01:24] there has to be a calling
[1:01:26] amen he's a Setter in order he didn't
[1:01:28] say the the you know the Evangelist
[1:01:30] would set things in order or the teacher
[1:01:32] would set things in order
[1:01:34] the Apostle would
[1:01:36] and and so you know today we're denying
[1:01:39] that denying the power of that the word
[1:01:43] If you deny that If you deny any part of
[1:01:45] the fivefold ministry you're denying the
[1:01:48] the word
[1:01:49] you're coming against the word
[1:01:51] no it's it's that's where we live that's
[1:01:54] where the rubber meets the road we can
[1:01:56] say message message message but you know
[1:01:59] Paul said that that there'd be people in
[1:02:01] the last day have forms of godliness but
[1:02:04] would deny the power thereof
[1:02:07] the power to what do signs and wonders
[1:02:10] no they don't deny that
[1:02:12] but the power of God to fulfill his word
[1:02:15] to fulfill Malachi 4 to fulfill
[1:02:19] Revelations 10.
[1:02:22] that's what they're denying that's the
[1:02:25] first they won't they'll agree with you
[1:02:27] on Supernatural they'll agree but when
[1:02:30] you come to the Malachi 4 Revelations 10
[1:02:32] Luke 17 30.
[1:02:34] no that's where it that's where they
[1:02:36] deny it
[1:02:38] they'll actually deny it see so he's a
[1:02:40] set or not he's a man sent from God to
[1:02:42] do things uh to set things in order the
[1:02:44] prophet is a special man he's a minute
[1:02:46] okay here the prophet says about the
[1:02:49] Apostle this is a warning in judgment
[1:02:51] you can read it
[1:02:53] he said you know the Apostle doesn't
[1:02:55] even have to be a minister
[1:02:58] isn't that amazing
[1:03:00] so it doesn't even have to be a minister
[1:03:02] he says a special man God God schools
[1:03:06] him and sends him out
[1:03:09] of a church you know we think of him as
[1:03:10] a minister sure but he's his office is
[1:03:13] an apostle
[1:03:15] to set it in order
[1:03:18] amen not see not I'm not trying to
[1:03:20] meddle tonight or you know but I'm
[1:03:22] trying to fulfill an office
[1:03:25] you know and we've we've had a prop
[1:03:27] prophetic office
[1:03:29] and I believe that prophetic office was
[1:03:32] infallible
[1:03:34] let me say it again
[1:03:36] anyone that's streaming or whatever that
[1:03:38] prophetic office was infallible
[1:03:41] he said it in himself he said who will
[1:03:45] have the power of infallibility it will
[1:03:48] be a prophet in the last days more
[1:03:51] Vindicated than any Prophet outside of
[1:03:53] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:55] and people say brother Brandon made
[1:03:57] mistakes sure as a man he he made
[1:04:00] mistakes but as a prophet as an angel
[1:04:04] there's no mistake with this message
[1:04:07] I remember one man he preached he said
[1:04:09] you know God didn't protect this message
[1:04:12] from mistakes he protected it from error
[1:04:17] there's no error in the message
[1:04:21] amen amen with him with man yes
[1:04:25] but not with that office
[1:04:27] that was God
[1:04:29] in inhabiting a vessel amen sending a
[1:04:34] messenger to this age like he sent Paul
[1:04:37] amen and that's what we need to stand
[1:04:39] for Saints we need to really stand for
[1:04:42] that because people are letting it slip
[1:04:46] you know Isaiah saw these angels
[1:04:48] seraphims holy holy holy they're letting
[1:04:51] Holiness slip
[1:04:53] they're letting other things slip
[1:04:55] see and that's why you know
[1:04:58] uh that message standing in the Gap I I
[1:05:01] just go back to that because if the
[1:05:03] prophet didn't like Isaiah
[1:05:06] if he didn't see
[1:05:08] where where he came short if the if the
[1:05:12] prophet of this day brother Branham
[1:05:14] didn't see his own complexes
[1:05:17] he would have been up there with Bud
[1:05:18] Southwick
[1:05:20] a a separated man
[1:05:23] and and then he would have been cut
[1:05:25] become a bum
[1:05:28] do you believe that would have happened
[1:05:30] absolutely
[1:05:32] the Lord said this is what's going to
[1:05:34] happen
[1:05:35] you do what you're thinking of doing
[1:05:38] you see and so the prophet had to had to
[1:05:41] reset
[1:05:43] he had to see that complex of rejection
[1:05:46] he had to get over that he had to get
[1:05:49] over himself
[1:05:51] and we have to get over ourselves and
[1:05:53] the message our message complex
[1:05:57] we all sometimes have a message complex
[1:06:00] and we got we got to overcome that like
[1:06:03] Elijah I'm the only one remember we
[1:06:05] spoke that here I'm the only one I'm the
[1:06:08] only one before he could go across
[1:06:10] Jordan and into the Rapture he had to
[1:06:13] realize that there was a Elisha to come
[1:06:16] and it wasn't all about him
[1:06:18] and it's not all about us
[1:06:20] there's a bride Universal
[1:06:23] amen and we and we and we got to just
[1:06:25] stay in step
[1:06:27] I used to be in a marching band and we
[1:06:29] had to stay in Step did I ever show that
[1:06:31] here
[1:06:32] you know I had two or three brothers
[1:06:33] marching with me left left left
[1:06:36] right left and that's fine you know
[1:06:39] you're walking down New York we're on
[1:06:41] Fifth Avenue marching in the band you
[1:06:44] know and then but then when you take a
[1:06:46] corner
[1:06:47] then then you you got to stay in line
[1:06:49] and you got to stay in step You're Gonna
[1:06:52] Stand step for the with the word for
[1:06:54] this day
[1:06:55] amen and what the prophet said
[1:06:57] stay with it and uh you know and my job
[1:07:00] was to the little guy on the end stay in
[1:07:03] line
[1:07:04] stay in line
[1:07:06] yeah you know and just put your hand out
[1:07:08] there every Sunday we had a practice
[1:07:10] Sundays every Sunday the same old same
[1:07:14] old same old
[1:07:16] but yet when we get on display
[1:07:18] in New York or Philadelphia when we got
[1:07:21] on display and we were in competition
[1:07:22] then you're on display every eye is on
[1:07:25] you amen and you're doing Precision
[1:07:27] marching and and all these things but
[1:07:29] you know
[1:07:30] that's where we're at
[1:07:32] we're on display Saints and everything's
[1:07:34] gonna be right
[1:07:36] amen we're heading to the finish line
[1:07:38] now I want to exhort you tonight
[1:07:41] hey man just just put on the whole armor
[1:07:43] of God
[1:07:44] don't settle for some wind of Doctrine
[1:07:48] go into the message yourself
[1:07:50] amen study the message ask your pastor
[1:07:53] asked an elder amen ask someone that's
[1:07:55] seasoned in the word what you know if
[1:07:57] you have questions
[1:07:59] are good things so
[1:08:01] um so standing in the Gap was very
[1:08:03] important because that's if we didn't
[1:08:05] have if that never happened to the
[1:08:07] prophet then we wouldn't have Christ The
[1:08:10] Mystery of God reveal we wouldn't have
[1:08:12] the Rapture things that are to be we
[1:08:14] wouldn't have marriage and divorce
[1:08:16] we wouldn't have future home
[1:08:19] we wouldn't have any of those things so
[1:08:21] that that's where the profit was so it's
[1:08:24] important to stand in the Gap and that's
[1:08:25] that's why I read that about pastors
[1:08:27] pastors have to stand in the Gap a lot
[1:08:31] of times
[1:08:32] be neutral
[1:08:34] and and stand in the Gap see you you
[1:08:37] know and and people want the pastor to
[1:08:39] take their side
[1:08:43] can I hear an amen
[1:08:45] amen sometimes the people you know
[1:08:47] they're just wait and if he doesn't get
[1:08:49] on their side they'll go to a pastor
[1:08:51] that will get on their side
[1:08:54] oh my you talk about we need to grow up
[1:08:58] a lot of people need to grow up and the
[1:09:00] message I mean you've been in the
[1:09:01] message 40 years and you don't you know
[1:09:06] hey man we're all guilty
[1:09:08] sometimes you know if you like the
[1:09:10] brother said if you can't say Amen say
[1:09:12] ouch
[1:09:14] don't frown
[1:09:16] don't nod
[1:09:18] say ouch if you're not going to say Amen
[1:09:21] say ouch
[1:09:22] you know you never get an amendment out
[1:09:23] of some people
[1:09:25] the word of God is yea and amen
[1:09:29] it's yay and amen say Amen agree with it
[1:09:32] even if you're not living it and then
[1:09:34] you become it
[1:09:36] you'll become it say amen that's right
[1:09:39] I'm convicted by that but Amen brother
[1:09:42] you're right amen so you know uh
[1:09:45] those Soul pastors are special people
[1:09:48] you know there's I'm talking about the
[1:09:50] administration of angels now we're all
[1:09:52] under the administration the umbrella of
[1:09:54] of a of an angel for the age
[1:09:57] which was the prophet of this day
[1:09:59] but there's other Administrations
[1:10:02] you know the prophet said your pastor is
[1:10:04] an angel
[1:10:08] why is quiet
[1:10:11] your pastor is an angel to the church
[1:10:14] just like the prophet was an angel to an
[1:10:16] age but the prophet wasn't a local
[1:10:19] pastor
[1:10:22] amen
[1:10:23] amen you know there's lots of spirits
[1:10:26] out there that will claim that
[1:10:28] but the pastor wasn't the prophet wasn't
[1:10:31] a local Pastor he's not my pastor
[1:10:34] you know what the prophet said I would
[1:10:35] never be a successful pastor
[1:10:39] I got an amen there amen he will he said
[1:10:43] I would never be successful he passed
[1:10:45] her 17 years
[1:10:47] never took an offering
[1:10:50] put it all in church
[1:10:52] I thought well that's pretty successful
[1:10:55] saw signs and wonders no he said that
[1:10:57] wasn't my calling
[1:10:59] do the work of an evangelist
[1:11:01] make
[1:11:03] full proof of your ministry
[1:11:05] amen so that's what he did so
[1:11:07] um
[1:11:08] let me go on uh in the order of angels
[1:11:11] you know it's strange because Hebrews 13
[1:11:14] says be not forgetful to entertain
[1:11:17] strangers
[1:11:19] for some have entertained angels unaware
[1:11:24] amen you ever you ever meet a stranger
[1:11:26] to tell you something and you thought
[1:11:27] boy that was God
[1:11:30] God use that stranger
[1:11:33] tell me something
[1:11:35] oh my
[1:11:37] so there's minor Angels there's major
[1:11:39] Angels there's archangels there's
[1:11:41] seraphims there's cherubims there's
[1:11:44] living creatures
[1:11:45] so many types of you know a t a good
[1:11:48] teacher get on that and break it all
[1:11:50] down
[1:11:51] a good teacher that sometimes the
[1:11:54] ministry you see that can put that
[1:11:55] together see but now we're living in a
[1:11:58] Time
[1:11:59] you know when there's like we read in
[1:12:01] the scripture that there's ministering
[1:12:03] spirits
[1:12:04] sent forth from the presence of God to
[1:12:07] minister to them that will be the Heirs
[1:12:10] of salvation
[1:12:11] amen and and the prophet talks about he
[1:12:15] said there's an angel there's an angel
[1:12:16] when they stand in the Pulpit there's an
[1:12:18] angel ministering to you
[1:12:20] God sends angels
[1:12:22] to minister to you to stand in the gap
[1:12:26] hallelujah amen I was just got a phone
[1:12:30] call today where I made a phone call to
[1:12:33] a man I uh I I passed on some work to
[1:12:36] him because I I couldn't take it
[1:12:38] so uh he was a home inspector and an
[1:12:41] inspector
[1:12:42] and uh
[1:12:44] there was a there was another gentleman
[1:12:46] that was a a a a a friend of both of us
[1:12:50] that had been an inspector and just
[1:12:53] before I came I heard he was in the
[1:12:55] hospital and I heard he was sick and I
[1:12:58] heard he had cancer and it was pretty
[1:13:00] serious but Aaron so you know my heart
[1:13:03] goes out to those people you know I just

[1:13:37] the hospital I wanted to see you and and
[1:13:40] his brother was standing there and uh so
[1:13:43] we didn't have any one-on-one time so
[1:13:45] his brother walked out and you know he
[1:13:47] said what have you been up to and I said
[1:13:48] well I just got back from Africa I've
[1:13:50] been doing some Mission work always said

[1:14:09] to me about God or the Bible or anything
[1:14:12] you know and he said would you have a
[1:14:14] have a little prayer for me and I said
[1:14:16] Brian I sure would
[1:14:19] I sure would and I took his hand and he
[1:14:21] said sit here on the bed with me and we
[1:14:23] held hands and you know I could just
[1:14:25] feel him squeezing my hand and you know
[1:14:28] he just wanted someone to pray with him

[1:14:46] and he said I'd like that
[1:14:48] amen I just so receptive you know it was
[1:14:51] just like a you know God had just got
[1:14:54] him down to his Deathbed

[1:15:33] felt he felt kind of guilty because he
[1:15:34] never witnessed him I said you know what
[1:15:37] I think he made it
[1:15:39] by just by his attitude and his respect
[1:15:43] just for his respect I said I I think he
[1:15:46] made it
[1:15:48] I like to see him on the other side
[1:15:50] amen praise God I I received that
[1:15:53] brother amen so standing in the gap
[1:15:58] a pastor's got to do that see and that
[1:16:01] and that's what we're anointed to do in
[1:16:02] the last stage by those living creatures
[1:16:04] and that's what the prophet did you know
[1:16:06] they asked the prophet you know are you
[1:16:08] going down to fuss with those
[1:16:09] denominational people and everything he
[1:16:11] said no I'm going down to guard that
[1:16:13] Mercy Seat
[1:16:16] the the mer the ark the word I'm going
[1:16:19] down the guard that and that's what
[1:16:20] we're here for brother Daniel we're here
[1:16:22] to guard that Ark that word
[1:16:26] amen we're not going to let it slip
[1:16:28] if they want if others churches want to
[1:16:30] let it slip let them let it slip but
[1:16:32] we're not going to do that
[1:16:34] amen we're going to contend for the
[1:16:36] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:16:38] Saints
[1:16:39] amen so so I want to finish with another
[1:16:41] type of angel
[1:16:43] one you know we could talk about the
[1:16:45] cherubims and the seraphims and the
[1:16:47] living creatures I love because those
[1:16:49] are the throne guards you know uh
[1:16:53] Ephraim Reuben
[1:16:55] Dan amen the ox Judah the ox the lion
[1:16:59] the the man the eagle
[1:17:01] amen and then the prophet said you got
[1:17:03] Matthew Mark Luke and John
[1:17:05] and said now you got like Apostles
[1:17:08] prophets teachers bastards what are we
[1:17:10] doing we're guarding something and that
[1:17:13] when you're guarding something there's
[1:17:14] something precious there there's
[1:17:16] something worth value when you put a
[1:17:18] fence up when you have a security
[1:17:20] there's something of value
[1:17:22] and God values his word
[1:17:25] amen and so you know the these angels
[1:17:30] we don't want to get into that but you
[1:17:31] know this there's another Angel that's
[1:17:33] probably closer to you than you realize
[1:17:36] and uh you know I've had people
[1:17:40] tell me about visions and and seeing
[1:17:42] angels and all that and that's fine you
[1:17:44] know that that could happen like you
[1:17:46] know uh Joseph Smith he probably did see
[1:17:48] an angel
[1:17:50] you know there's an example in the Old
[1:17:52] Testament to two prophets and one lied
[1:17:55] and said an angel came to me
[1:17:57] they told me told me to tell you to come
[1:17:59] to my house but he lied
[1:18:04] there's there's all kinds of angels
[1:18:06] there's a lot lying spirits that are
[1:18:08] sent
[1:18:09] so we got to discern it how are you
[1:18:11] going to discern it by the word
[1:18:13] amen the word is a discerner of the
[1:18:16] thoughts and intents and experiences if
[1:18:19] they experiences are okay as long as
[1:18:22] they line up with the word
[1:18:24] amen so amen so you know you don't go by
[1:18:27] experience I mean you know a lot of
[1:18:29] people had good fantastic experiences I
[1:18:31] I've had men I've had a man sat in my
[1:18:35] house that was in brother brana's
[1:18:37] meeting when he was a little boy he was
[1:18:39] a Haida Indian
[1:18:41] and and the prophet said
[1:18:43] told his mother she's praying for his
[1:18:46] mother but he said that child when he
[1:18:48] grows up he'll be he'll be in a fire
[1:18:51] there'll be Fire and Ice but God will
[1:18:54] bring him through it
[1:18:55] they didn't know what he was talking
[1:18:57] about
[1:18:58] and he grew up to be an Air Force pilot
[1:19:01] and when he was flying over Alaska his
[1:19:03] Pilot crashed in the mountains he
[1:19:05] ejected and he landed in a bunch of this
[1:19:08] area of snow and ice and the plane was
[1:19:10] burning there in front of him and his
[1:19:13] mind went back to the prophet when he
[1:19:15] was a little boy
[1:19:16] and he said you'll see fire and ice but
[1:19:19] he said God will take you through and he
[1:19:21] said it was fantastic testimony he
[1:19:24] talked about he he went to Full Gospel
[1:19:25] businessmen
[1:19:27] and and gave that testimony about being
[1:19:29] a brother man's meetings Full Gospel
[1:19:31] businessman have a lot to answer for
[1:19:34] so does this generation
[1:19:36] amen and and you know when he was he was
[1:19:39] telling us he was telling me that that
[1:19:41] testimony and he had been in many
[1:19:43] message churches
[1:19:45] but uh and then another brother sitting
[1:19:48] with me he he turns to him and he says
[1:19:50] you know he says uh you just came from
[1:19:53] Eastern Canada you were in a pat you
[1:19:55] were in a Baptist Minister's house and
[1:19:58] you you were witnessing the message to
[1:20:00] that Baptist Minister and in in his
[1:20:02] living room there's an organ and on the
[1:20:04] organ there's a name of a little girl
[1:20:05] that died and they dedicated that organ
[1:20:07] to the little girl
[1:20:09] he said you just came from there and the
[1:20:11] brother looked at me
[1:20:13] he says couldn't believe it
[1:20:15] he said how did you know that he said I
[1:20:17] just saw it
[1:20:18] you're talking about gifts
[1:20:20] you know but they experienced us but
[1:20:22] they have to line up with the word those
[1:20:25] gifts like discernment
[1:20:27] that is not a Pulpit Ministry
[1:20:30] what we saw was a sign of the Messiah
[1:20:34] that was one in a generation
[1:20:37] amen but I've seen that I've seen that
[1:20:40] gift work I've seen that gift work on
[1:20:41] Pulpit disordered me
[1:20:44] but it was only so that they could get
[1:20:46] influence
[1:20:48] that they could get money
[1:20:51] that they could use that influence
[1:20:55] themselves
[1:20:56] sad but true
[1:20:59] how haven't we haven't we fed on the
[1:21:02] word enough to discern that
[1:21:05] we should know that and yet people will
[1:21:07] run after those things
[1:21:09] wow what a Ministry and I've sat under
[1:21:12] the I've sat in those meetings and it's
[1:21:15] wow you know and
[1:21:16] told me one man told me what I was
[1:21:18] wearing in my bedroom what color suit I
[1:21:20] had on and how I changed my suit
[1:21:23] is that true Brother Martin
[1:21:26] yes it's true yeah they all go crazy
[1:21:31] what what's like what sign what Wonder
[1:21:35] made us believe the message
[1:21:39] what Vindication was it that made you
[1:21:41] believe the message no you heard the
[1:21:42] word you heard an eagle scream that's
[1:21:45] what I wasn't in any of the meetings
[1:21:48] I never seen those things I heard the
[1:21:50] tapes but I never seen any of that
[1:21:52] myself it was the word
[1:21:54] that came and and and and it and it just
[1:21:59] Shone light on that seed amen and so you
[1:22:02] know yes fine but let it line up to the
[1:22:06] word if you if you say you got a gift in
[1:22:09] the fivefold ministry it better line up
[1:22:10] to the word
[1:22:11] not your own Doctrine
[1:22:14] amen so I'm I'm just being a little bit
[1:22:16] forceful tonight
[1:22:18] amen but that that's what I'm called to
[1:22:20] do
[1:22:21] I want to fulfill my office
[1:22:24] and you know uh Paul Paul talks about
[1:22:27] these angels
[1:22:29] they're also celestial bodies bodies
[1:22:31] terrestrial Glory the glory of one
[1:22:33] Celestial and the glory of the
[1:22:34] terrestrial is another there is one
[1:22:36] glory of the Sun the Moon
[1:22:37] and another glory of the stars and they
[1:22:40] all differ from one another in glory so
[1:22:42] also as a resurrect direction of the
[1:22:44] Dead is sown and Corruption it is raised
[1:22:46] into corruption it is sown a dishonor it
[1:22:48] is raised in glory it is sown in
[1:22:50] weakness that is raised in power it is
[1:22:52] sown a natural body it has raised a
[1:22:54] spiritual body
[1:22:57] there is a natural body and a spiritual
[1:22:58] body and so is it written the first man
[1:23:01] Adam was made a living Soul the last
[1:23:03] Adam was made a quickening spirit
[1:23:06] we have another body Saints
[1:23:11] second Corinthians 4 and 18 and while we
[1:23:14] look not at the things that we see but
[1:23:16] the things that we do not see
[1:23:18] for the things which we are seeing are
[1:23:20] temporal but the things we do not see
[1:23:22] are eternal
[1:23:24] second Corinthians 5 and 1 for we know
[1:23:26] that if our Earthly body of this house
[1:23:28] Tabernacle be dissolved we will have a
[1:23:30] building not a house made with hands
[1:23:33] Eternal in the heavens for in this we
[1:23:36] groan earnestly Desiring to be clothed
[1:23:38] upon with our house which is from heaven
[1:23:41] earnestly Desiring
[1:23:44] how much are we Desiring that body
[1:23:48] you know how much are we Desiring that
[1:23:50] body change the Lord woke me up here
[1:23:53] last in the last six months
[1:23:56] and it was about you know early in the
[1:23:58] morning and he and the voice said you're
[1:24:01] not expecting the rapture
[1:24:06] boy I hit the floor over there I just
[1:24:08] hit the floor it was just like and then
[1:24:12] I realized I'm not
[1:24:13] I'm busy doing this busy doing that and
[1:24:16] serving the lord doing this doing that
[1:24:17] but I've lost that expectation
[1:24:20] that I had and you had when you first
[1:24:23] came in that you got in by the skinnier
[1:24:25] teeth and you didn't know if you had
[1:24:27] next week
[1:24:29] that expectation earnestly Desiring
[1:24:34] to be clothed upon
[1:24:36] with that body from Heaven amen so
[1:24:40] that's what we're that's what we're
[1:24:42] losing
[1:24:43] that's what we need to stir ourselves up
[1:24:46] put ourselves in remembrance of these
[1:24:49] things though you know them
[1:24:51] but be stirred up see
[1:24:53] by these things earnestly Desiring
[1:24:55] Matthew 18 and 10 and you don't need to
[1:24:58] turn to it but uh
[1:25:01] I'll just read it take heed that you
[1:25:03] despise not one of these little ones for
[1:25:05] I say unto you that in heaven their
[1:25:06] Angels do always behold the face of My
[1:25:09] Father which is in heaven
[1:25:13] little ones
[1:25:14] you have representation
[1:25:17] you have a representation
[1:25:20] on the other side
[1:25:22] see they're Angels they're Messengers
[1:25:26] do you know you have an angel
[1:25:28] you have a messenger
[1:25:30] every one of us has an angel
[1:25:33] every one of us has a messenger
[1:25:36] amen Hebrews chapter 3.
[1:25:38] series
[1:25:39] in Jeffersonville IN 57 the prophet said
[1:25:43] in them days he was talking about Peter
[1:25:45] in Acts chapter 8. he was talking about
[1:25:48] Peter being released from prison and an
[1:25:50] angel came and opened the door
[1:25:52] right Angels the administration of
[1:25:55] Angels in the early church
[1:25:58] the administration of Angels in the last
[1:26:00] day Church
[1:26:02] the last day book of Acts oh I'm excited
[1:26:06] brother
[1:26:07] uh you know we're in contact with angels
[1:26:12] ministering spirits
[1:26:14] a five-fold Ministry also amen we have
[1:26:18] everything we need
[1:26:20] you know and he says here about that
[1:26:22] book of Acts
[1:26:23] incident he says and and he'll he opened
[1:26:26] the doors for Peter so Peter runs to
[1:26:29] John Mark's house
[1:26:31] and in them days they said the prophet
[1:26:33] said you just didn't open the door you
[1:26:35] had to look through and see who was
[1:26:36] there because they'd kill you
[1:26:39] sometimes to be a robber or someone you
[1:26:40] know so the the sister went to the door
[1:26:43] if you open the door they'd kill you he
[1:26:45] said he opened the she opened the door
[1:26:47] she said oh oh it's Peter they said oh
[1:26:50] my he's dead
[1:26:53] they must have killed him in prison
[1:26:56] that's his name that's now that's his
[1:26:59] Angel standing there they must have
[1:27:00] killed him they'd done he done got into
[1:27:03] his glory his glorified body or you know
[1:27:05] that theophany body
[1:27:08] he said he must have went into his
[1:27:11] theophany
[1:27:12] said you remember how we took it in the
[1:27:14] big diamond how it reflects the light
[1:27:16] how it went through back there and this
[1:27:19] Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved so they
[1:27:22] thought Peter was uh in his in his
[1:27:25] theophany
[1:27:26] and he goes on to say we have we have a
[1:27:29] one already waiting he's quoting Paul
[1:27:31] and uh they thought Peter had done died
[1:27:34] and that old body had dropped and they
[1:27:36] just buried it they'll bury it in a few
[1:27:38] days and he entered into his angel
[1:27:44] into his angel
[1:27:46] his spiritual body
[1:27:49] that was his angel
[1:27:50] that was his messenger he said he
[1:27:53] entered it into it there
[1:27:54] see that theophany will pick up this
[1:27:57] body
[1:27:58] so and we enter it in into it there
[1:28:00] death will take us there
[1:28:03] the prophet said we bypass that
[1:28:06] death will take us there but I want to
[1:28:08] show you something else if you read read
[1:28:11] read the message and look look in
[1:28:14] context he said see that theophany body
[1:28:16] they thought he was in ethiopathy body
[1:28:18] his angel
[1:28:19] the body that body that's already
[1:28:21] prepared
[1:28:23] it could it see in that form it it
[1:28:25] couldn't shake hands
[1:28:28] see but Peter could shake their hands
[1:28:31] so he was an industry it has that the
[1:28:34] oven he has no chance to shake like
[1:28:35] nothing to Shake in that form but it's
[1:28:38] an image of a man that come down and was
[1:28:40] knocking at the door that's what they
[1:28:42] thought she said no it's Peter he's
[1:28:45] standing there they opened the door and
[1:28:46] he walked in and there he was now Peter
[1:28:49] has been Peter had been delivered by
[1:28:52] this light this angel
[1:28:55] who is this Melchizedek I won't be too
[1:28:57] much longer just stay with me for a few
[1:28:59] minutes
[1:29:00] who is this Melchizedek the prophet's
[1:29:03] talking about the eagle story you he
[1:29:05] said you know you then after you
[1:29:07] recognize the word of God like the eagle
[1:29:09] heard the scream he said then you left
[1:29:12] the other thing
[1:29:14] you've been then formed into the living
[1:29:16] image of the Living God
[1:29:18] you live then
[1:29:20] been formed into the living image of the
[1:29:23] Living God that's Genesis 1 27 when he
[1:29:27] made you
[1:29:29] a spirit man first
[1:29:31] you were made Spirit man first before
[1:29:33] you ever come to this
[1:29:35] he made you in Genesis 1 26 27. let us
[1:29:39] make man in our own image
[1:29:41] in the image of God what image was that
[1:29:43] the prophet said when he came out from
[1:29:45] the thoughts of God when Christ the
[1:29:49] anointing the logos came out it was in a
[1:29:52] form of a pillar of Fire
[1:29:54] which which then became a man
[1:29:59] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:30:00] was with God the Word was God the word
[1:30:02] was made flesh the logos
[1:30:05] he said he was a pillar of fire when he
[1:30:07] went out that's the form Paul met him in
[1:30:10] he had more than any of the disciples
[1:30:13] that saw him in the flesh the prophet
[1:30:15] said he met him in the form that he was
[1:30:17] in Genesis
[1:30:18] amen Saints amen we met him in that same
[1:30:22] form
[1:30:23] he took his picture with a prophet in
[1:30:26] this age
[1:30:27] we've met him in that same form
[1:30:30] the pillar of Fire
[1:30:32] so he said then then you heard that
[1:30:34] eagle scream see the new birth then
[1:30:37] you've been formed you're starting to be
[1:30:40] formed into the living image
[1:30:43] of the Living God
[1:30:45] see then you left the other thing you're
[1:30:47] formed you heard from your
[1:30:52] theophany you heard from your angel
[1:30:57] amen that which you were before the
[1:30:59] foundation of the world you heard
[1:31:00] something
[1:31:01] and it and it clicked
[1:31:04] amen so that's what the message is about
[1:31:09] it's about election it's about
[1:31:11] predestination it's about our Eternal
[1:31:14] destination and where we come from where
[1:31:17] we're going back to
[1:31:19] see that Pillar of Fire you know it came
[1:31:21] down became a man in Melchizedek it
[1:31:23] became became God and two angels the
[1:31:26] prophet said that met Abraham
[1:31:29] and told Sarah what she was doing in the
[1:31:31] in the tent right he said Gabriel and
[1:31:33] Michael just he took up some potash and
[1:31:36] 16 elements blew it and Gabriel and
[1:31:39] Michael stepped in
[1:31:40] went down with God then he said he made
[1:31:43] himself a body and then he stepped in
[1:31:46] he said that was God and two angels
[1:31:48] amen so Saints
[1:31:51] this is our heritage
[1:31:53] this is how it started this is how it'll
[1:31:55] end
[1:31:56] who is this Melchizedek
[1:31:59] who is this Melchizedek that that that
[1:32:02] God came down with two angels he's the
[1:32:05] same one that came down to with two
[1:32:07] angels and spoke to Abraham then he then
[1:32:09] he made another body and and uh stepped
[1:32:13] into that which was Melchizedek
[1:32:16] then Melchizedek we didn't see him
[1:32:19] anymore then he then he then he stepped
[1:32:21] into Jesus Christ
[1:32:23] made himself a body
[1:32:25] stepped into it
[1:32:27] amen
[1:32:28] sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not
[1:32:31] Hebrews 10 but a body thou has prepared
[1:32:34] me Hebrews 10 7.
[1:32:37] Revelation 10 7 he came down
[1:32:40] made himself a body chose a little body
[1:32:43] in this age a little prophet
[1:32:45] amen and use that vessel that angel to
[1:32:48] minister
[1:32:49] to those that will have eternal life
[1:32:52] It's a Wonderful message Saints and we
[1:32:54] just need to dig in we need to dig into
[1:32:57] it it's not about church attendance
[1:33:00] it's not about ties
[1:33:02] it's not all about that
[1:33:04] it's not about it's more than that
[1:33:08] it's not about just Doctrine it's a
[1:33:11] person
[1:33:12] without beginning of days or ending of
[1:33:14] life
[1:33:15] Amen in Hebrews chapter 6 Paul says let
[1:33:18] us now therefore go on go on to
[1:33:21] perfection
[1:33:22] let us lay aside the principles of the
[1:33:25] doctrines of Christ
[1:33:26] baptisms and doctrines and we argue over
[1:33:29] this and I said let's go on to
[1:33:31] Perfection amen not laying again the
[1:33:34] foundation the foundation's been laid in
[1:33:37] the message we've had a foundation
[1:33:40] amen we just need to build properly on
[1:33:42] it
[1:33:43] and and that's what Paul said in Hebrews
[1:33:45] chapter chapter 6.
[1:33:47] and then Hebrews chapter 7 after he's
[1:33:50] talking about that then it goes into
[1:33:53] Melchizedek
[1:33:55] chapter 6 says Man chapter 7 is
[1:33:59] God
[1:34:00] Melchizedek
[1:34:02] the Eternal Elohim
[1:34:04] that's who that's who's here
[1:34:07] Hallelujah that's who's here with us
[1:34:09] Saints and that should excite us I mean
[1:34:12] you know it you're going to have your
[1:34:14] trials you're going to have your daily
[1:34:15] battles and sometimes that doesn't mean
[1:34:17] a lot but you know what if you get a
[1:34:19] revelation of that those trials and
[1:34:21] those tests and those things that get
[1:34:23] you down that won't mean as much
[1:34:25] because you see something greater
[1:34:28] not on the things Paul said that we see
[1:34:30] but the things that are unseen
[1:34:33] amen that's what we're looking to the
[1:34:36] Unseen
[1:34:37] amen how many that you know what if if I
[1:34:40] was there and then I'd just be jumping
[1:34:43] I'd just be jumping up and down yeah
[1:34:44] we're looking to the things that are
[1:34:45] unseen we're looking at this milk has it
[1:34:47] who is this milk has it again me
[1:34:50] it's the same one that was that was in
[1:34:52] Jesus Christ
[1:34:54] if the Same Spirit dwells in you that
[1:34:56] that raised Christ from the dead he that
[1:34:59] raised Christ from the dead who was he
[1:35:03] God right
[1:35:05] and then Jesus turns around says
[1:35:07] destroys us Temple and I'll raise it up
[1:35:09] who is he that was him that was it that
[1:35:13] was the I am talking in Jesus there's
[1:35:15] the godhead it's so simple
[1:35:18] if that Spirit dwells in you and the
[1:35:20] prophet said you will raise yourself up
[1:35:25] how are you going to do that
[1:35:27] by your theophany
[1:35:29] by that body that was prepared before
[1:35:31] the foundation of the world
[1:35:33] that in Genesis 1 26
[1:35:36] that's how you're going to do it
[1:35:37] when the prophet makes a statement like
[1:35:39] that he's not joking
[1:35:42] he said you will raise yourself up and
[1:35:44] you realize this Melchizedek the power
[1:35:47] that's in you you go out and create
[1:35:49] worlds
[1:35:50] and go live on them
[1:35:52] is that too big for us are we kind of
[1:35:55] hunkered down on just just oh I'm just
[1:35:58] surviving
[1:36:00] I'm just overcoming
[1:36:03] we should be victorious
[1:36:05] amen who cares if my hip doesn't work I
[1:36:10] don't care if brother Aaron is my body's
[1:36:12] breaking down amen who cares oh you know
[1:36:15] I I said when I was going overseas they
[1:36:17] they told me that our doctor said I
[1:36:19] don't know you're going overseas like
[1:36:21] well even if I have to crawl I'm gonna
[1:36:23] go
[1:36:24] amen and God sustained me
[1:36:27] God sustained me and he'll sustain you
[1:36:30] but you got to have a vision you gotta
[1:36:31] you gotta have a revelation of he that's
[1:36:34] within you is greater than he that's in
[1:36:36] the world who is this Melchizedek who
[1:36:39] was that theophany
[1:36:41] that was standing there that served
[1:36:42] Abraham communion
[1:36:44] amen oh my it's the Eternal one
[1:36:47] amen who became Jesus Christ
[1:36:50] amen Jesus had a beginning he had an end
[1:36:53] right he died God can't die amen neither
[1:36:57] can you die neither can I die the
[1:37:01] prophet said if someone you hear someone
[1:37:03] say you I died don't believe him
[1:37:05] they're very much alive
[1:37:07] tonight and they're here a cloud of
[1:37:10] witnesses and a theophany that you have
[1:37:14] sitting beside you
[1:37:17] has come to church with you sister
[1:37:20] amen but oh yeah well you know I don't
[1:37:22] feel it or I don't see it you don't have
[1:37:24] to feel it or you don't have to see it
[1:37:26] you just believe it
[1:37:27] and God will manifest it
[1:37:30] in Germany there when I when I was I
[1:37:32] didn't say that in the in the bishop
[1:37:34] report but in Germany under his ringin's
[1:37:36] church there was a sister that had
[1:37:38] cancer
[1:37:39] and and and it was terminal she knew
[1:37:41] that it was her time was close they uh
[1:37:44] she was at home and she wanted to get to
[1:37:46] service one more time she went on a
[1:37:48] Sunday before she died and she said I
[1:37:51] know I'm going to die she said but
[1:37:53] she told Brother Andre Dre's ring and
[1:37:56] she said I have such a piece that it
[1:37:59] scares me
[1:38:01] he said I have such a piece about this
[1:38:03] isn't that the way to go
[1:38:06] he said I have such a piece it scares me
[1:38:08] he said would you I just want you to
[1:38:10] pray one more time and and brother
[1:38:12] Andrea said there was a presence there
[1:38:16] that her angel was there
[1:38:18] and he said the word theophany came to
[1:38:21] him your theophany is here
[1:38:23] you know it was coming closer it was
[1:38:26] coming closer she was going
[1:38:28] it's coming closer and then standing
[1:38:30] closer
[1:38:31] and uh you know that theophany is only a
[1:38:34] few feet away
[1:38:36] amen and uh another little sister in
[1:38:39] Germany came up to me she said I was in
[1:38:41] the baby room
[1:38:42] said you know and I was I was you know
[1:38:45] you know how hard it is sometimes
[1:38:46] mothers you're taking for your children
[1:38:48] and you're distracted and all those
[1:38:50] things but she was you know she she had
[1:38:52] an ear open and all of a sudden she said
[1:38:54] Brother Martin she said I was up in the
[1:38:57] corner of the room watching myself fix
[1:38:59] the baby
[1:39:03] is that too Supernatural for us
[1:39:06] is that strange
[1:39:08] that shouldn't be strange to us
[1:39:10] it the message is full of it
[1:39:13] the prophet was in his theology when he
[1:39:15] prayed for Georgia Carter up in the room
[1:39:17] his theophany I got there before he got
[1:39:19] there
[1:39:21] try to explain those things you can't
[1:39:23] but it's real I know it's real like I
[1:39:27] said I was in Poland and I was I was up
[1:39:29] here and I was thinking
[1:39:33] how can I do that
[1:39:35] because there's two of me
[1:39:38] there's two of you
[1:39:40] there's your there's your spiritual man
[1:39:43] you're you have a body Celestial and a
[1:39:46] body terrestrial
[1:39:47] amen and and the prophet says here I
[1:39:49] didn't I didn't finish that quote
[1:39:53] you did I say that you've heard from
[1:39:55] your theophany
[1:39:57] when you heard that eagle scream you've
[1:39:59] heard from your theophany
[1:40:01] there's two places now
[1:40:03] I'm not just taking one isolated quote
[1:40:07] but he said then you've heard from your
[1:40:09] theophany your word body because your
[1:40:11] word body knows everything
[1:40:13] and we just bypassed it but we're in
[1:40:16] touch
[1:40:18] we're in touch I'm in touch and I'm
[1:40:22] waiting I'm waiting just to step into
[1:40:25] that
[1:40:27] one of these days
[1:40:29] amen you're gonna see like Enoch you're
[1:40:31] going to see a path
[1:40:33] you know Moses and Elijah they were in
[1:40:35] their theophonies on the mount
[1:40:36] Transfiguration
[1:40:37] and Peter James and John recognized them
[1:40:40] the prophet said how did they recognize
[1:40:42] him because they had theophonies
[1:40:46] that's in eternity
[1:40:48] you see and they were in that presence
[1:40:50] and that's why we don't recognize these
[1:40:52] things we don't get in the presence of
[1:40:54] God enough
[1:40:55] we got to be like Isaiah let's get down
[1:40:57] to the altar
[1:40:59] let's come here early and pray
[1:41:02] let's not show up in five minutes
[1:41:04] oops maybe I'm getting out of my place
[1:41:06] here
[1:41:07] maybe I'm trying to put things in order
[1:41:10] no the pastor will will do that amen but
[1:41:14] there there there's there's a place for
[1:41:16] it
[1:41:17] amen you know and and sometimes it's
[1:41:19] easier if someone else says it
[1:41:22] come early
[1:41:23] not the last but coming let's pray get
[1:41:26] down to the altar go like guys Isaiah
[1:41:29] down to the altar to the prey let's go
[1:41:31] down let's go down let's go down to the
[1:41:34] river to pray
[1:41:36] amen
[1:41:37] praise God Amen so you've heard see from
[1:41:41] your theophany
[1:41:43] and he talks about
[1:41:44] uh
[1:41:46] the male Transfiguration Moses and
[1:41:49] Elijah there
[1:41:50] so he says the prophet says thank God
[1:41:53] for these the opening of these Seven
[1:41:55] Seals that we can understand these
[1:41:57] things
[1:41:58] where in the denominational world do you
[1:42:01] hear about
[1:42:01] theophanes
[1:42:04] huh
[1:42:06] when you when you were in denomination
[1:42:08] but did you hear about your theophany
[1:42:11] amen it it took someone that was on the
[1:42:14] other side
[1:42:15] that went into his theophany
[1:42:17] that experienced that
[1:42:19] amen thank God for the opening of those
[1:42:23] Seven Seals that we see these things and
[1:42:26] things can come into order
[1:42:28] in the church
[1:42:30] amen so Hebrews 6
[1:42:32] like I said leaving the principles let
[1:42:34] us go on to perfection
[1:42:36] amen and and uh Hebrews 10 a new body a
[1:42:39] body thou has prepared me God has
[1:42:41] prepared a body for us
[1:42:43] things that are to be
[1:42:45] when the prophet preached the rapture
[1:42:48] and then he couldn't finish that
[1:42:50] the next thing he preached was things
[1:42:52] that are to be
[1:42:54] that was the end of the Rapture amen
[1:42:57] and and uh you know the prophet preached
[1:43:00] many things like uh when he preached on
[1:43:03] that things that are to be
[1:43:06] he says he uses the the context in my
[1:43:08] father's house are many
[1:43:11] theophanes
[1:43:13] many mansions
[1:43:15] that's what he uses and the prophet was
[1:43:18] preaching his own funeral
[1:43:20] he said this sounds like a funeral text
[1:43:22] well it was
[1:43:24] God was taking him off the scene
[1:43:27] and he said I'm going to use it now
[1:43:28] things that were prepared for you when
[1:43:30] you came as a baby are things are
[1:43:31] prepared for you when you get to the
[1:43:33] other side
[1:43:34] things are being prepared now
[1:43:37] amen and you're being prepared by what
[1:43:40] listening to your theophany
[1:43:43] you see the new birth didn't do that for
[1:43:45] us
[1:43:46] see well you needed more than the
[1:43:49] earnest at Pentecost we're not the
[1:43:51] process we're not going just back to
[1:43:52] Pentecost
[1:43:54] the book of Acts we're going back to the
[1:43:56] Garden of Eden
[1:43:58] where we had Dominion
[1:44:00] over the whole thing
[1:44:02] you see that Pentecost didn't produce a
[1:44:04] Rapture tongues of fire came down yes
[1:44:07] fulfill the scripture Joel 2 28 but it
[1:44:10] didn't produce a Rapture neither did
[1:44:12] 1906 producer Rapture but this will
[1:44:14] produce a Rapture this message will
[1:44:16] produce a Rapture to get us back to the
[1:44:19] garden
[1:44:21] and and that image that we were in with
[1:44:24] no sin amen and we'll build and we'll
[1:44:27] plant
[1:44:29] amen will occupy
[1:44:31] remember we'll build new houses
[1:44:34] amen you know you know and and you'll be
[1:44:37] with your Eternal mate and you'll say Oh
[1:44:39] Sister Marjorie uh you know how would
[1:44:41] you how would you like this constructed
[1:44:43] well I like the Contemporary our
[1:44:46] architecture mid what is it modern
[1:44:49] contemporary or
[1:44:51] the one you like right something like
[1:44:53] the houses down here
[1:44:55] you know you're going to have a say in
[1:44:57] it
[1:44:58] you're going to create that yourself
[1:45:01] you know how would you like this you
[1:45:02] know and and your Eternal mate will be
[1:45:04] there you'll
[1:45:05] you'll be you'll be there that'll be
[1:45:07] real we'll plan we'll build
[1:45:09] we'll occupy no and no one else will
[1:45:11] take it over
[1:45:13] and that's why I love the Earth so much
[1:45:14] this is my world
[1:45:16] this is our world and it's beautiful
[1:45:18] from the from the you know from the
[1:45:21] jungles of Africa to to the to the
[1:45:23] Arctic
[1:45:24] then I've been in the Arctic and that's
[1:45:27] got its own Beauty too but they won't
[1:45:29] have we won't have snow
[1:45:31] thank God for that
[1:45:34] but if you see the Arctic without snow
[1:45:37] it's beautiful there's some beauty up
[1:45:39] there
[1:45:40] amen so that's where that's where we're
[1:45:43] going things that are to be and I wanted
[1:45:45] to just prick your conscience a little
[1:45:48] bit just think about that now pray God
[1:45:51] reveal this to me
[1:45:53] reveal this to me when you heard from
[1:45:56] your theophany you see Pentecost didn't
[1:45:58] produce it and the earnest doesn't
[1:46:01] produce it
[1:46:03] we've been given Ephesians we've been
[1:46:05] given the earnest of our Salvation
[1:46:07] that's only the down payment what they
[1:46:10] had then was only a down payment now we
[1:46:12] got the full thing it's paid off
[1:46:16] he paid it off Revelation 10 he paid it
[1:46:19] off
[1:46:20] now we heard from our original theophany
[1:46:23] and we're going home
[1:46:25] we're going home soon
[1:46:28] so let's prick ourselves
[1:46:30] let's let's not let these things slip
[1:46:33] we're under the administration and
[1:46:35] influence of angels and you've got that
[1:46:38] angel
[1:46:39] see and that's why you know that's why
[1:46:41] the prophet labored on who is this
[1:46:43] Melchizedek read that message again
[1:46:45] it's just a wonderful message
[1:46:48] see and and we wouldn't have had that if
[1:46:50] he didn't get over his complex
[1:46:52] Jesus said if I have told you Earthly
[1:46:54] things and you believe me not how shall
[1:46:57] you believe if I tell you Heavenly
[1:46:58] things
[1:46:59] not everyone can receive this
[1:47:03] even in massive circles
[1:47:05] not everyone can receive it and no man
[1:47:07] he says has ascended up into heaven but
[1:47:10] he that came down from heaven even the
[1:47:12] son of man which is in heaven
[1:47:15] they're looking at them
[1:47:17] you're looking at me but there's another
[1:47:19] part of me another Martin Warner that's
[1:47:22] in heaven
[1:47:23] and he's standing just to hear
[1:47:25] that's not an imagination
[1:47:27] that's real
[1:47:29] and it's just that we can't see that
[1:47:31] dimension
[1:47:33] amen so so the prophet I'll just end
[1:47:36] with this
[1:47:37] the prophet maybe the musicians could
[1:47:39] come
[1:47:41] the prophet was talking about being past
[1:47:43] the curtain of time
[1:47:45] and he runs into his his daughter
[1:47:48] Sharon Rose
[1:47:50] and she's a young lady
[1:47:52] maybe like this young lady
[1:47:55] amen I don't know how old you are sister
[1:47:57] but
[1:47:58] I won't say
[1:48:00] but just a young lady didn't recognize
[1:48:02] her can you imagine
[1:48:06] you were talking about angels last night
[1:48:08] by the way
[1:48:10] remember you were talking about angels
[1:48:12] that's what we're talking about tonight
[1:48:15] he didn't recognize his own daughter
[1:48:17] why because when he saw her
[1:48:20] she had crossed eyes
[1:48:23] their eyes were crossed from suffering
[1:48:26] with pain
[1:48:28] a little baby that couldn't tell you how
[1:48:30] much it was suffering flies were on its
[1:48:32] face
[1:48:34] that's the last time he saw her
[1:48:36] on Earth
[1:48:38] now he sees her as a young woman
[1:48:40] beautiful young woman
[1:48:43] amen who are you don't you know me daddy
[1:48:46] I'm your Sharon Rose
[1:48:48] well I don't understand this he said I
[1:48:51] don't understand this he said Daddy
[1:48:53] don't you remember what you preached
[1:48:57] how did she know what he preached
[1:48:58] [Music]
[1:49:01] how did you know
[1:49:03] she was in her theophany
[1:49:05] her word body she knew because she knew
[1:49:08] all things and she knew the message of
[1:49:10] this hour she knew about who is this
[1:49:12] milk she could have said Daddy don't you
[1:49:15] remember what you preached on who is
[1:49:17] this Melchizedek
[1:49:19] and that's what you said don't you
[1:49:20] remember what you preached
[1:49:22] because in that body there's no
[1:49:25] yesterday There's No Tomorrow there's
[1:49:27] just now
[1:49:29] amen and you are the prophet you are the
[1:49:32] angel of this age
[1:49:34] you had a message for this age and
[1:49:36] that's what's brought you here to this
[1:49:37] place
[1:49:38] nothing but perfect love
[1:49:41] for the word
[1:49:44] amen because it's not be strong delusion
[1:49:48] will come even in the message not
[1:49:50] because you don't have the word but
[1:49:52] because you don't love the word you
[1:49:55] don't love the word enough you got to
[1:49:57] love it with all your soul all your mind
[1:49:59] all your heart that's how we need to
[1:50:02] love it
[1:50:03] we gotta we gotta forsake ourselves
[1:50:06] amen when you love it like that
[1:50:09] and you have that character like that
[1:50:10] like the prophet had when he was when he
[1:50:13] was dying in that intern turned him over
[1:50:15] and he's he's he he groaned in pain and
[1:50:17] and then he said oh I'm sorry he said
[1:50:20] and the prophet said oh no uh
[1:50:22] I forgive you for that
[1:50:25] even in that condition
[1:50:28] amen and he was ready for that body that
[1:50:31] body was prepared and you could tell his
[1:50:34] vessel was ready
[1:50:36] but we're so close now Saints
[1:50:40] this is the evening time
[1:50:42] it's later than we think
[1:50:45] and those bodies are coming to this body
[1:50:48] we've got representation Genesis 1 26
[1:50:51] like I said when you have representation
[1:50:55] amen that's a different thing
[1:50:58] we we had representation on the cross
[1:51:02] when he died the prophet said you died
[1:51:04] in him
[1:51:05] and then when he was buried he said you
[1:51:07] were buried in him
[1:51:09] you were buried in it I was buried in
[1:51:11] him I was there that day
[1:51:14] you were there that day that's not just
[1:51:17] a colorful phrase
[1:51:19] we were there
[1:51:21] you were in him Amen brother you were in
[1:51:25] him there you died on that cross when I
[1:51:27] got saved that's what I saw I saw the
[1:51:29] cross over the
[1:51:32] over the Euler Stadium
[1:51:34] right over the Euler Stadium the one
[1:51:37] they're going to tear down brother Allen
[1:51:38] I thought
[1:51:39] I saw my sins and I saw Jesus hanging
[1:51:42] there
[1:51:43] your sins are there it became personal
[1:51:46] it was a personal thing and although I
[1:51:48] tried to run away from it I tried to run
[1:51:50] away from my calling I told you people
[1:51:52] that I had a complex I almost lost my
[1:51:55] lost my Ministry lost everything
[1:51:59] could have lost my wife
[1:52:01] amen but I had representation
[1:52:03] see I had you ever don't matter what you
[1:52:07] did amen God like the brother said God's
[1:52:10] forgiven you for that
[1:52:12] your your theophany is never sinned and
[1:52:15] you had a representation there
[1:52:18] so he said when you were buried you were
[1:52:19] buried in and then when you Rose he rose
[1:52:22] you Rose in him
[1:52:25] he said when he was on that cross he
[1:52:27] said he paid for your sins but he said
[1:52:30] you paid for your own sins
[1:52:33] [Music]
[1:52:35] that's a that's a mouthful
[1:52:38] why because you were in him
[1:52:40] yes he paid for it but you were in him
[1:52:42] so it's paid that's why you can raise
[1:52:45] yourself up
[1:52:47] that's why you've got a body that will
[1:52:49] raise yourself up
[1:52:51] amen I'm not trying to get technical I'm
[1:52:54] just saying these things are real
[1:52:56] and it's time for these things it's time
[1:52:58] you don't hear from your theophany just
[1:53:01] once
[1:53:02] that was the earnest you wouldn't then
[1:53:05] you got in contact
[1:53:07] become born again the new birth but
[1:53:09] you're a spiritual babe and the prophet
[1:53:11] lays that out and who's Melchizedek said
[1:53:13] you only become a spiritual babe then
[1:53:15] you have to grow up
[1:53:17] hear more from your theophany what is it
[1:53:20] that's speaking to you in the night
[1:53:22] [Music]
[1:53:24] what is it that reveals a word to you
[1:53:27] it's the Holy Ghost
[1:53:28] it's that eternal spirit it's that
[1:53:31] theophany
[1:53:33] that connection you have
[1:53:35] and we're going up into that
[1:53:38] so the earnest we got more than the
[1:53:41] earnest
[1:53:42] amen we're changing
[1:53:45] dispensations
[1:53:47] amen foreign
[1:53:52] beloved now are we the sons of God let's
[1:53:54] Stand Together

[1:54:05] shall be like him for we shall see him
[1:54:08] as he is
[1:54:10] we'll have a body like his own glorious
[1:54:12] body the theophany will pick up and the
[1:54:15] prophet said it knows where the ashes it
[1:54:17] knows where the calcium it knows where
[1:54:20] the 16 elements are
[1:54:22] so if you go by way of the grave don't
[1:54:25] worry
[1:54:26] don't fear like that sister he said I
[1:54:29] have such peace

[2:03:49] to tell them but I can testify that
[2:03:52] they're the truth
[2:03:54] I can testify by my own experiences that
[2:03:57] some of these things that our brothers
[2:03:59] said about the theophany are true
[2:04:01] because I have been there
[2:04:05] Job chapter 1 verse 6 says this now
[2:04:08] there was a day when the sons of God
[2:04:12] came to present themselves before the
[2:04:14] Lord sister Shirley who are those sons
[2:04:16] of God who we have a representative over
[2:04:20] there friends and it is us it is this
[2:04:25] person right here not this corruptable
[2:04:27] flesh not this man that you see but
[2:04:31] there is another man there is another
[2:04:33] woman over there that is in the presence
[2:04:36] of God a theophany being I wish I
[2:04:40] understood it better oh it's just so
[2:04:43] wonderful It's a Wonderful is it good to
[2:04:47] be here tonight
[2:04:48] I want to I do want to tell something
[2:04:51] really quick our brother said
[2:04:53] he talked about the different offices in
[2:04:55] the fivefold ministry and brother
[2:04:57] Branham himself and he was quoting
[2:04:58] brother Graham say I could never be a
[2:05:00] successful pastor
[2:05:01] I've told the congregation here brother
[2:05:03] martin but I'll tell this tell this for
[2:05:05] you and and brother Alan that when I was
[2:05:09] in Ministry in Jeffersonville brother
[2:05:10] Billy Paul brought in an old Ledger for
[2:05:13] the Branham Tabernacle
[2:05:16] and he wanted me to I was in charge of
[2:05:19] the archives he wanted me to file it
[2:05:21] away and
[2:05:23] um it was in a it was in a
[2:05:26] file cabinet
[2:05:28] and I asked him for the key gave me the
[2:05:30] key and I started going through the the
[2:05:31] stuff and reading it and it was a ledger
[2:05:34] from 1934 up until about
[2:05:38] 1946.
[2:05:39] and on that ledger
[2:05:43] was the offering brother Brown said he
[2:05:44] never took an offering but they took an
[2:05:46] offering in the church
[2:05:48] and it had a it had a recording of that
[2:05:50] offering
[2:05:52] for I don't know what it was 34 to
[2:05:56] 10 12 years
[2:05:59] it was usually like 90 cents a dollar a
[2:06:02] dollar 25 that this offering was
[2:06:06] and then when brother Branham got his
[2:06:08] commission and he went out into the
[2:06:10] field
[2:06:12] the ministry just exploded the Branham
[2:06:16] Tabernacle people started coming in
[2:06:18] thousands of people coming through all
[2:06:21] the time but all that time there in
[2:06:24] Jeffersonville it just stayed small
