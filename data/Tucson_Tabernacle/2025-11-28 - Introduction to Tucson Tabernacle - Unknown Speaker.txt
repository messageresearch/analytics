========================================

In John chapter 17, Jesus prays that the disciples would be in such unity that the world would see their unity and know that God sent Jesus Christ to the world. Jesus is asking the father for a church that would produce such love that sinners would come to salvation not through their doctrine necessarily and not necessarily through their music but through the love that they have for each other. Spirit of the church is loving, caring. When I came here, the first smile I saw was actually Sister [music] Heather's. And she welcomed me with a huge hug and I felt welcome and not judged [music] or anything. &gt;&gt; I would say uh loving for sure and accepting. And we don't care what anyone looks like or what your background is, but we just want souls to be saved and them to come to the Lord and have a better life through him. &gt;&gt; My favorite thing about Tucson Tabernacle is the pastor. He has a lot of compassion and love for us. The second is the congregation and you know all the brothers and sisters get together and it's all love. They don't discriminate. I think Tucson Tabernacle is a great place u for someone who is scared of meeting new people. We understand those struggles and those [music] fears and I feel like you always have someone there to shake your hand or greet you and that helps so much to take that nervousness away. &gt;&gt; I value our pastor. He's very special. Has a lot of depth and loves the people. That's for sure. And I value that very much. gone to church all my life since I was born. But coming to Tucson Tabernacle uh changed my outlook as a Christian that a Christianity was not a set of deeds but was a life lived and I found that at the tabernacle that was the emphasis to live a life worthy of the gospel in a sense that others could see Christ in you. It's amazing [music] whenever you you hear the congregation singing and you know you're all just singing to the one creator. You're just singing to Jesus Christ and it's 150 whether it's 150 [music] on Sunday morning or 50 people on Wednesday night. It's you get there and the spirit comes down because all of us are singing to one person. It's and that's to Jesus Christ. It's not about me. It's and it's not about the congregation. It's just about Jesus. &gt;&gt; The Tucson Tabernacle is a place of refuge where you can come in, you can feel accepted, you can worship with great music, hear a Bible-based sermon, but it is also a place of ministry. You may be dealing with your own sins, but don't forget the guy next to you. He's dealing with something, too. Come into this church to serve. Not to serve yourself, but to serve others. I promise you'll get what you need, but make it the focus. Make it your focus to serve others. That's the spirit of Christ and that is the Holy [music] Spirit. That's what I want to see in a church. That's what I want to see in the Tucson Tabernacle. And I really think that we are moving in the right direction.
