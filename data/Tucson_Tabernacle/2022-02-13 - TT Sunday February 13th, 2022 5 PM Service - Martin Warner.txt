[Music] do [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] coming into come in to stay come into my heart lord jesus stand as we sing [Music] into my heart [Music] into my heart come into my heart jesus [Music] amen this monitor is not on i don't think so it's kind of hard to turn back and look this way so amen good to be in the house of the lord this evening again he said where two or three are gathered in his name he'd be in their midst so he's here but ask brother mark to come open the service in prayer and maybe just greet the share a little bit what's on his heart and maybe to warren sister janna that would probably call on her to sing again today so amen [Music] [Music] i guess um why don't you be seated for a minute i wonder if um visiting ministers get called on because they have the reputation of wanting to you know having the itch wanting to say something i've never i've never had that well maybe i had it a little bit but i certainly don't have it now um but i would like to share something with you that maybe i could be a a help or a blessing something that could uh you could take away tonight um it's uh it's springtime in the desert we used to go to this nursery and and this man would tell us that the last day of january is the last day of winter in the desert and first week of february usually you can start to see the buds coming out the birds returning and so forth so we're gardeners and we we have our winter garden i don't know if many know it but the winter garden is the best garden in tucson you can lots of things you can plant and so we're getting our spring garden in now and putting tomatoes in we're a little late on the tomatoes they should have already been in and you start them in little cups and we do the heirlooms and then you put them out when it's you know time to beans and whatever else we we put in but um you know i i got to thinking this morning when when we came into the back of the church i really felt at home we don't have many at catalina byway now we have a few families that's it and you go through life i guess i'm saying this because i just turned 70. you know so if i'm going to say anything i better go ahead and say it but um you through life you you come through the stages of life and you have great expectations you you think you know i'm going to write a great book or i'm going to preach great sermons and i'm going to have hundreds of people to listen to my wonderful words of wisdom and then that's your carnal side you know and then it just doesn't quite turn out that way and you turn 70 and you end up with two or three families and you you still do it every week i'm enjoying myself more than i ever have i come into the back of the church each sunday now we live on the property so we're there all week so i'm in and out of the sanctuary doing different things from time to time but when i enter that sanctuary on sunday morning it is totally different even with just a few people the feeling that's there the sense of god's presence is so powerful and especially with i see you didn't come tonight but with my song leader there leading songs it's just a wonderful atmosphere my wife has to be away from the house now a lot she's working with arne's girls around the clock to take care of an older woman and so when she comes home you know there's a different presence when i'm there by myself it's it's just not the same but the presence on sunday morning is totally different it's different even than my wife's presence which is dear to me and when i came into this church today i felt such a joyous presence there is probably no place that we would be if we ever shut down we would be here with you i was talking about growing things because saints god is growing a garden and this thought came to me recently you know as you grow older and you you go through the stages of life and you you have many disappointments and things didn't turn out just the way you thought they would you look back and you think well you know what did i do what what good was i you know the devil comes to you and starts asking you those questions and you enter your later years and you've got just a few people that you're ministering to and you start to think you know should i shut this thing down i actually came to the church last january and i said look let's just shut down and we'll go down and go to the tabernacle we'll just enjoy no they didn't want that that that wasn't what the in fact several of them started crying immediately so i said okay i'll be here as long as you want me here but the thought came to me this year why not just be a wonderful flower in god's garden why do i have to think about preaching great sermons or doing some great work why not when we go out in the morning and those first little tomato plants come up it's just there's just something about it you know it's so special well we're that little flower in god's garden why can't i just be that little flower that he takes pleasure in day in and day out isn't he wonderful we so often lose sight of what's really important and so often the most important thing is so close to us that we miss it i don't want to miss it i think we're very close how many of you are aware of what's happening with russia now it's it's like it's like we want to go to war we're pushing them into war does that make any sense to you they have everything they need to destroy us we can't compete with the defensive weapons they have i mean it doesn't make any sense but we know that there's a vision that has to be fulfilled let's just be a precious flower in his garden father lord we were so blessed this morning the smiles of those young black boys that picture will be forever painted in my mind to think that what your word does in our hearts lord how it draws us to you and lord it does the same thing to those young boys in that country over across the sea as it does for us lord we just invite you tonight to come and minister to our hearts lord draw us close to you lord a lord just in each heart tonight we just pray that you would do something special lord may we just grow a little closer to you we ask it in jesus name amen amen thank you brother mark he had mentioned that to me that they had thought of coming but the church said no so as a brother who loves his church said then i'll stay with you brother robert figaro had said the same thing to me about that same time as their group had grown smaller you know but then the congregation said no we want to stay together so brother robert said then i'll stay with you so as god leads us we'll go won't it be wonderful there having no burdens to bear forget that the word's up to them amen what a promise we have but you know what makes it even one more wonderful you're going to be there with us each one of us be there together to serve to sincere and and be with our lord and savior when with the savior we enter the glory and won't it be wonderful then ending the troubles and cares of the story and won't it be wonderful then won't it be wonderful there having no burdens to bear joyously singing with heart bells all ringing won't it be wonderful there walking and talking with christ the supernova won't it be way praising adoring the matchless eternal won't it be wonderful won't it be wonderful there having no burdens to bear joyously singing with heart bells all ringing won't it be wonderful there there where the tempest will never be sweeping won't it be wonderful [Music] won't it be wonderful then won't it be wonderful then having no burdens to bear joyously singing with heart all ringing won't it be wonderful then yes won't it be wonderful then having no burdens to bear joyously singing with heart bells already won't it be wonderful there amen eye has not seen ear has not heard it says it's not even entered except to those to whom god has revealed if you read the end of that scripture and he gives you a glimpse and a taste of what it will be like so a couple of there's a couple of requests to bring to your attention here my sister-in-law elizabeth we call her misty sent a prayer request saying she's in much pain from the shingles that she's had for quite some time now and they just don't seem to be clearing up and the only comfortable position she's in is lying down the rest of time it's pain so it's been a struggle so she asked us for prayer so let's just believe that today after prayer the healing process will begin and we'll hear a testimony of that [Music] and brother diego asked that we would remember their daughter melinda that she would like us to remember or to uphold little james in prayer he has a high fever that doesn't want to go away james needs a touch from the lord so amen the little ones that all they can do is either cry or express it that way but god knows god knows the cry of the heart so you have a need say lord i have a need and we don't want to approach it in a way say lord this is what you have to do for me but rather lord i present my need to you you minister as you would know what's best if you'll stand brother i'll come up with you and and minister in prayer and hold that before the lord say lord i believe and sometimes we even have to say help thou my unbelief and he ministers thank you god bless you all this evening it's such a wonderful time that we can be together on a sunday night i'd like you to especially also remember my wife in prayer because she has put up with a lot it's her 51st wedding anniversary today and she's had to put up with me for over half a century i wouldn't wish that on anyone but i'm certainly grateful let's just go to the lord in prayer lord jesus we're so grateful that we can join our hearts together lord that we can set aside all the the issues of life around us lord and just focus on you this evening lord jesus i bring this sister elizabeth before you with the shingles lord that you would just touch your body this very moment lord that that brother aaron will get the text or the phone call or the testimony this very evening that says praise god it's gone the pain is gone i'm well lord we know you can do it and we trust you and we thank you in advance lord for your love and your concern for our sister and for this little baby james lord that's running this fever lord we pray that you break that fever lord and especially that you take away the cause of the fever and lord we just want to give you the praise and glory this evening we're looking forward to hearing from you this evening great things we trust you and we thank you and we praise you we worship you forgive us of every sin every short coming lord in our life lord and help us lord to just be united together in you in jesus precious name we ask amen amen sister heather would you do it again amen amen i i just like to commend this couple right here what a wonderful couple to have in the church here with us [Applause] amen you're just slightly ahead of brother mark there brother lyle as he said he turned 70 i believe you just turned 71 right 72. just slightly ahead brother mark if you need some advice and some counsel amen but you know what our father the eternal one watches us over us all amen oh when the redeemed are gathering in i am thinking of a rapture amen it's what comforts you it's what encourages you saying this world's not my home i'm just passing through when the redeemed are gathering and get the words i am thinking of the rapture in our blessed home on how when the redeemed our gathering is how we'll raise a heavenly anthem in the city [Music] air [Music] when the redeemed are gathering in there will be a great procession over on the streets of gold when the redeemed our gathering is oh what music oh what's singing or that city will be wrong when the redeemed [Music] like [Music] will sing redemption story with their voices clear and strong when the redeemed are gathering then the angels all will listen for they cannot join the sun when they're redeemed [Music] day [Music] then the savior will give orders to prepare the bankruptcy when the redeemed our gathering and we'll hear his invitation come he blessed all the lord when the readings are gathering when the rape [Music] [Applause] [Music] how we will shine [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh what a day that'll be amen you may be seated sister janna if you if you would come so as you mentioned anniversaries it just realized that mom and dad just had their 67th anniversary [Applause] i'm grateful to have what's that it's february didn't it okay they almost had all right i'm getting older i guess i was just thinking for some reason i know what it was just last week 46 years ago we moved to tucson that's what it was but almost 67 years and how do i know that because my brother's 66 and i always add an ear year to that that's how i remember but i appreciate having godly parents that love the lord jesus and if and done this and all of you that have had that privilege it has been a blessing to have that privilege thank you i was thinking brother martin saying this morning about that missionary he wasn't home yet you've heard this song many times my mom wrote but i thought it was appropriate after that my mother is jerusalem i was born in heaven above the place i dwell is heavenly the atmosphere is love [Music] praise god we're gone [Music] to that place our lord [Music] prepared for us [Music] in the spirit of [Music] the lord remember back when you came home from work or school or play how glad you were to have a place at the closing of the day it mattered not if it's the fair or the thing that really mattered was [Music] i'll tell you of a better place [Music] a place that i feel homesick for if ever i should roll a place where i commune each day with one who died for me with loved ones around his table where we'll feast i only feel at home in the place [Music] in the spirit of the lord wherever i may go i just cannot feel at home but in the spirit in the spirit of the lord [Music] spirit of the lord in [Music] the lord i only feel at home in the place where i was born and that places in the spirit of the lord [Music] [Applause] hey man i i was thinking back the first time when i got to hear the peterson sing mr in about 85 86 they came over to the spanish tabernacle brother daniel ramirez brought them over they sang there and i said my goodness who are these folks listen to them sick the three of them and it's been a blessing ever since to get to know the families i've been just wonderful people speaking of the spiritual in the spirit of the lord [Music] gods of peace [Music] hearts are man [Music] [Applause] [Music] in the presence [Music] is [Music] presence [Music] you made it when i'd come out he still wasn't there yet amen i was asked after service this morning about giving a missionary offering and if you have something you would like to give just put in the offering box if you want to mark it however but there's something we would definitely want to do and it was just a joy to see those folks worshiping the lord and we say they don't have anything compared to us maybe they don't but they have the same god and that's where the joy is that's where the worship comes from because you know this living god and you sing about him you you just believe on him and he draws near and as brother dan we were talking a little bit by dan evans he's not subject to our wants and our desires to tell him this is what you should do but rather we just surrender to him and he works and led him that's how it works right brother dan as we were sharing a couple of testimonies lord i need you to do this and he says no i just need you to wait on me and let me do it his way so this evening our brother martin with us and and i know that this morning was a blessing this morning was a good reminder that god is still god and he's still on the throne so let's stand and give them the time that he needs to minister what god has put on his heart and and you could just in your own way say lord you know my need you know my desires would you minister today and you draw and pull on that amen one more time in the presence of jobs [Music] troubles [Music] hearts are [Music] we were singing it this morning greater than all my sin brother was singing this morning i enjoyed that song [Music] my sin [Music] this is me it's the grace that still sets me free to praise him i know the blood's [Music] i cannot fall for it's greater than all the blood of the lamb one more time let's sing together look how great the blood is greater than all my high sin is [Music] me is the grace that still said it's me free to praise him i want to praise him i know the bloods are applied i'm living in nearness of life i cannot fall for it's greater than all the blood of the lamb just power heads father we're thankful for that blood tonight lord and we come asking you wash us in the bleeding word tonight father forgive us of all our mistakes and failures lord and our shortcomings we just ask for your blessing to be upon the word tonight and upon the people again lord just get me out of the way father move me aside if i could just step aside lord and let you speak tonight father be worth it all that we gathered here together father may when we leave this place lord our hearts burn within us lord with that love lord we feel we felt today lord jesus and the love we feel tonight we're so thankful for that love lord jesus you loved us before we loved you you loved us we weren't looking for you you were looking for a part of yourself lord and we're thankful for that we ask your blessing on the word now and the remainder of the service in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you thank you i've really uh enjoyed the special tonight sister janna that was really more than i could ask for i just was really blessed in the in the back there just listening to that and this morning god bless you it was very appropriate so uh we're going to take our bibles tonight turn to james chapter 5. we're going to take a thought out of the scripture uh this morning james chapter five we'll go to verse 16. uh this morning i forgot to just the last powder part of the powerpoint there was a couple of slides i wanted to get so brother get those ready we'll as we finish the scripture we'll we'll tie those in james chapter 5 and verse 16 confess your faults one to another and pray for one another that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much elias was a man of subject of to like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and the and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months and he prayed again and the heavens gave rain and the earth brought forth her fruit revelations chapter three one more scripture and revelation chapter 3 and um behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice verse 20 and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me that's in the evening time amen that's this day that we're living in to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne he that has ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches may the lord bless his word you may be seated i'd like to take a a text from james tonight on the the life of elijah that he was a man of like passions and we kind of tie that in from this morning speaking about elijah and him being the same yesterday today and forever the brothers over there in this last couple of weeks they had a cyclone hit them just after the meetings and uh it took out about 17 churches to right to the ground and many of the believers houses are gone and so i just had a few slides there i don't know did you have those brother or he says okay so he's he's bringing those up that's just the some of the devastation that was there that's in southern malawi it's it's it's an occurrence uh sometimes there's monsoons or things come in from mozambique and they cross over into malawi in 219 when we were there with the floods we were they experienced the same things but they come across in the low-lying areas and the believers a lot of believers are in those areas that's a vast area there so it it's devastation and i know you had a cyclone or something hit here in kentucky i think it was just recently or i don't know what it was a hurricane or and a tornado yeah and it just destroys a lot of property and they don't have much property but you can see how high the water is in their homes and the problem is uh the way they build the houses they don't put cement they can cannot afford that they just kind of dried mud sometimes and so when the when the rains come and you know the winds hit that it just crumbles so different uh pitchers they sent me and and that's usually the that's typical i mean that's that's no more than 200 square feet i would say or less and that's typical it's hard to see i was over there maybe three weeks doing the flood relief and it's hard to walk through those villages and see those people in their homes and like two parents and three big adult children like teenage children and they're living in a something that size you know that's that's that's hard to see and then it's just a piece of mud on the ground so it's it's uh okay that's i just wanted to make you aware that that they are having you know they're having a relief uh fund and we're trying to help them to to get the churches back and to get some of the homes if we can we can help them so pray for them amen we can support them with our prayers and uh pray for them they sometimes they they don't have nowhere to go the government sometimes favors certain people in certain areas of the country and people that are loyal to the parties or to the government so they get the aid and stuff first if there is anything but mostly it's uh international organizations or you know that are that are coming in also and and helping and um i know several of the churches last time got together and and did some work there so so pray for them um as i said this morning uh the the amount of uh success of a revival or a convention like that is the amount of repentance and i didn't mention that many many ministers many people came and and made their made their confessions that they were wrong some of them were into false doctrine and uh different things like polygamy and uh practicing those things and uh and then you know just forsaking the assembling of themselves and some of them were you know just playing tapes and that was you know something that the correction came in and they came afterwards and said we want we want to get right with god we we believe it's wrong so you know that was a that was a big thing for me like that's why i thought it was the most successful meetings i was ever in in africa were these meetings and there was a lot of challenges and usually that's the way there is it is you know that yourselves as a church you you put something together you put harmony in the desert together there's a lot of challenges because there's a blessing waiting there and i really enjoyed the harmony in the desert also we were streaming that up up north a lot of people were streaming it you didn't know you had a lot of people watching you and it was uh we were right there with you and we enjoyed it so much so god is doing things amen god is bringing harmony and that's what we need we need unity and i i mentioned i preached on that the unity of the faith overseas and it's not a physical thing that we're all in one church but it's a spiritual invisible union of the bride of christ amen so we'll take this thought tonight uh get right to it on a man of like passions elijah was a man of like passions in in the book of kings also we read the great exploits that elijah had done and we know he was a great mighty prophet one of the greatest prophets there was and how that god used his spirit five times amen it was a faithful spirit but you know it wasn't the spirit of a man right amen we know that it wasn't the spirit of man it was the spirit of christ the spirit of elijah was the spirit of christ that's what he used five times and the prophet said if you can't see christ in every scripture go back and read it again it was christ all the way through and so elijah did some mighty works he you know he spoke like in in chapter one of verse or chapter 17 verse 1 he he said they'll not be do nor rain till i call for he spoke like god because he was god he was god for that hour for that position for that place amen and it's so close there amen and the prophet said it's so close you can be so close but you can be off if you make me god you're off but you can be so close saying that because that's how god speaks through a prophet so um james here you know he he talks uh he talks about the great works of elijah and how he prayed earnestly he actually you know he spoke like god he stopped the rain he controlled nature he was fed by ravens he created food oil and meal amen he raised the dead amen he rebuilt the altar then restored truth he turned the hearts of the children children of israel back to jehovah amen he called fire down from heaven he said if i be a man of god let fire come down from heaven where have you heard that before where you know where do you see that happen that's a man of god he said if i be a man of god amen if you know and we are the children of god where we serve the same god amen and we can we can claim the same authority amen and we you know he was a man of like passions and sometimes we elevate him way up here but he was a man down here too he had a human side and as we all do so he uh he he destroyed king's armies he was fed angels food he outran horses you imagine the things that happened in elijah's ministry in life you know and he went up to heaven in a whirlwind he's taken off the earth amen many great things and it's often the case that we judge things by sometimes one aspect of a man's life or or vice versa one failure of a man's life we judge sometimes things by just one thing or or what we read but there's always another side to it there's always something else that we're missing sometimes and and the message brings that out the message really brings that out and and the prophet brings it out in the message and we can we can glean a lot of golden nuggets there amen so hopefully we'll find a few tonight and shine them up and take them with us to home so but he did have a a human side and i want to preach to you tonight and speak to you on on that on that subject that we're talking about two u's the real you the inside you and the outside you there's really two of you amen there's not three but there's two of you the real you that c gene that that god that found you before the foundation of the world the prophet said that that's what we're speaking to the deity and there was a conflict between elijah's deity and his humanity there was a conflict and he was a man of like passions the scripture says passions means lapses or deviation from truth or uprightness he was a man that you know he had his lapses he had his failures like every prophet amen or he wasn't human if you're human you're gonna have them amen so that's that's what he's saying here james is taking that side of it right and we're reading in in the book of kings and we're just seeing the great exploits but also in the book of kings you'll see where elijah had lapses he had weaknesses he had complexes amen and so uh it's it's a you know misdeeds or mistakes besetting sins character flaws let me uh let me live with you long enough and i'll see yours if you live with me long enough like my wife now 38 years for 39 years she knows all of them every one of them but i know hers too so we're not perfect we're not it's you know they say in a perfect world well we're not in perfect bodies this is not a perfect body and this will never be perfected and you can never it can never be redeemed it has to be changed it's just a past house like the prophet said you're only living in a pesthouse until you put on that other coat amen you're going to another house to my father's house amen so um you know that the age we're living in is so complex and there's so much that plays on our mind there's so much stress there's so much pressure we live in it's a it's an age where it's almost the prophet said i'm fit to live and how much more is it now than it was in his day unfit to live there's no clean place this is the only clean place right in the house of god amen in your home there's the only clean place there is there's the only place the spirit of god can rest he wants a resting place amen he has to find a resting place and he finds his rest in us amen so it's an age where you know uh the greatest battle ever fought is intensified and uh i see it in myself i see it in myself i see uh you know with this covet and and the complexes that's produced and mental oppression mental sickness mental disease and you see people just going off they just lose it and violent and you know i said that's not my that's not that's not where i want to dwell i don't want to dwell there hey man i don't want to get caught up in that you know when i was in africa this time i i made sure i just took a a fast from social media hey man i didn't want to read the news anymore you know and and there and me and my wife we have sometimes differences of opinion and when and when i'm listening to the news and i'm grumbling and then she's grumbling and then we're just grumbling and i'm saying what is this doing to us we're feeding on that stuff too much you know i mentioned in africa also i asked the brothers i said do you have any mamba snakes here they said yes i said are they ever on the highway no no they're mostly in the bush we see them you know the mamba and the prophet had a dream about our vision about the mama and he said it come up on the road it was chasing a brother he was trying to jump out of the way you all know the story and uh he said it ever strikes him it's death amen and and i thought you know that mambo was on the highway and that's that was odd that struck me odd why was he on the highway because what what do we call the internet the information highway and i said young people watch out watch out and old people too these old people watch out how much news you listen to how much you feed your spirit on that stuff amen because and and it's a blessing for some of them they don't have some of them don't have phones they don't have internet and things and and they're more blessed it's just it's a simpler life it's it's a lot less stress saints amen you know the devils tries to pull one over on us and get us involved and draw us in take sides and let's not do that amen let's take take sides with jesus take signs with the word amen whatsoever things are holy whatsoever things are good whatever things are a good report think on those things speak on those things and then stay away from those negative things i've seen it in europe just divide families divide churches amen it's a spirit of the age amen and it's on that highway you know you just do without that for a while wow just the stress that everything's you know you don't we don't have to know everything we don't have to know the the the last events the last days we know the time we're living in we know it's a time of judgment but there's mercy in a time of judgment amen so uh now elijah didn't think that he had complexes because uh we can go to the scripture on that i don't know if i'll get to it we'll see but you know he didn't think he did but he did james said he did he was a man of like passions temptations like the lord he was tempted but without sin right he was tempted but without sin and and and it's not a sin to be tempted it's not a sin to have have oppression sometimes or be mentally oppressed or or or you know or bombarded by things because that's because we're human we're that just means we're human we're not robots we're not we're not sawdust we're not pieces of metal amen we're human beings and god knows we have weaknesses but he's made a provision for those things praise god for the blood of the lamb greater than all my sins greater than all my iniquities paul said the same thing he struggled with it paul did he said you know in romans 7 he said the things that i would do i do not the things i wouldn't do those things i do look at the prophet when he when he when he tried to explain the third the third pole and the angel came and stood there with his arms he said you did exactly what i told you not to do he said with his stern eyes oh what a feeling that must have been for the prophet he says i know he said i'm a dummy i'm i'm stupid i i i'm sorry and there was grace now now you learn from that let's go on this is how you do don't explain this amen so we we get into trouble sometimes like that but we can overcome our weaknesses we can overcome our faults and we can overcome them they might not ever leave but we can overcome them that's why i read revelation 3 and 20 to him that overcometh will sit with me it's you're always going to have this sticky flesh this is always going to be with us so we might as well fight the good fight of faith fight the war that's going on within us overcome ourselves before we overcome something else amen and i think that sometimes we we we've got to be aware where the battle is really raging amen and it's it's just not it's not with you know the government right now it's not with uh uh pierre trudeau or uh justin trudeau sorry i'm talking about his father or or or biden or anyone else it's not that's not where the war the war is here the war is within us and if we can overcome that if we can you know uh find satan's tactics and and and and and take and overcome them amen then we've got then we got power and authority with character character to handle that power god doesn't give it out sometimes because we don't have the character to handle it they meant it sparingly the prophet it can be sparingly given out because we need the character so we got to overcome right here right now right in our own church right in our own lives right in our own homes we got overcome right in our own homes that's where it starts that's what we bring into church i'm going to preach i'm going to preach it anyway you know you might you might not enjoy it like the mission say well the mission report was good but that was enough but i'm just going to preach there and say preach what's on your heart so when we get into it now the trouble is sometimes people i'll say people we we don't want to overcome them we're stubborn and we cuddle sometimes we cuddle those weaknesses sometimes we baby them because sometimes it makes us feel good oh ouch sometimes it you know it's not that you can't overcome them it's you won't overcome god help us amen to want to overcome to be overcomers in this age we're predestinated to be an overcomer amen nothing can stop us saints nothing can stop us and we don't want to let our flesh stop us or any any of those things so we want to we like to procrastinate it's human that's a weakness and uh you know like like moses he used his weaknesses as excuses what was he doing he was cuddling them i'm comfortable here comfortable with this i'm comfortable i don't like it but i can co-inhabit god help us not to co-inhabit we got to overcome it whatever it is and the holy spirit can put his finger on that tonight so you know maybe we'll always have them like i said but we can overcome them and they can't stop us unless you let it stop you amen don't let nothing stop you don't let yourself the other you amen stop you you feel tired you don't want to go to church well just drag him to church you're going to church amen you're going to hear the word you're going to hear the saints sing and rejoice and praise god and feel the atmosphere of the holy spirit what's wrong with that but it's the battle of getting there and now in this age satan has made it so much easier through the internet amen it's a trick of the devil sometimes you know we just fall for something it looks so good but it can harm us too if we're not if we're not careful so there's a difference between uh human weaknesses and complexes i'll use them together but there's a difference between them a weakness which we all have weaknesses if we dwell on them if we fixate if we make them bigger than god we make our problems bigger than god so then he can't solve them if we make them bigger than god he he cannot solve them because we're the ones that are making them bigger than him right so we we want to not fixate we we understand we'll all have a human weakness of one sword or the other because we all we all you know are born under different circumstances and you know sometimes uh like the prophet said it's a it's like a a plant that a rock sits on that plant and it grows up you know in an angle so it's kind of off and you know we're all that way we're all really the human race right from adam and eve are dysfunctional we're all dysfunctional amen and we need god you know when i got saved my brother said now oh now you've got a crutch you know now you got religion and you got a crutch and uh you know i i don't need that but he needs it today and he wants me to pray for him amen but that's what they see you see that's all they see at first they just say oh you've got a crush i said well who's not limping who's not who's not sick it's a sick that need a physician and you know uh i could go on about that but you know it's people don't see those things we we all need god's help and i'm i'm i'm thankful that i can raise my hands and say yeah i needed god yeah you know i couldn't quit drinking i couldn't quit those things god took it from me amen i needed god that gives god praise see that give god power amen in your life when you give him the glory and and and people realize oh you know well maybe i should try that right there's another there's a better way there's a better life so so sometimes you know we fixate on our weaknesses or things that have been passed down to to us and that makes you know when we fixate it on it then it becomes a complex then it really does some damage that's when it really can can can throw you off and take you out of the will of god so we don't want it to get to that point pray and that's why he james said pray for one another confess your faults confess your weakness brother i just i struggle with this you know i i i have confidence you as a brother or sister you you won't tattle it all around you just pray with me will you have the church pray whatever you know that we're too proud sometimes we're just too proud to say that and uh it's a complex it becomes a complex it becomes a fear so uh you know it's like that sister the brother branham talked about uh or i think it was in one of the books she says she was always afraid of storms and she didn't know why but her father had been in a storm that he saw a dead child on the road and that was before she was born you know that yeah before she was born and that fear of storms was in that sister's life all her life and she didn't know why and the prophet said oh i see him coming down the road with the horses the horses stop there's a dead baby in the in the road and uh he said your father just the horses just stopped and your father had that fear and he said that's why you're afraid of storms it's not my you know how would we ever know that what's passed down to us that we don't know sometimes things that happen in my father and my grandfather and my father my all my father's brothers were in the second world war my grandfather was in the second world war out of hartford connecticut and uh things that they saw things that they experienced passed down and so we are all in need of god we are all in need of help amen and and and and we can we have a place we have a place we have there is a bomb in gilead tonight amen and it's in god's word and so it cannot stop us these things cannot stop us unless we let them amen um and we don't want to do that we want to move on move forward i was watching uh the life story of uh corey tenbu how many ever read her story corey tembo yeah it's a good story young people you want to read that story she was she was a young person and uh she fell in love and and then because of the the class or the financial situation then uh she was turned down and uh that was a great sorrow in her life but she instead of dwelling on that she turned her life and she started to help people and people less fortunate and people that had disabilities and she started to help them and that took up her life she started to minister saints you can minister you can minister to your neighbor you can minister to those that are around you to the sick that you know amen you can do those things and and and that gets your mind off of your own problems and your own weaknesses your own failures your own shortcomings when you do something for someone else what does the prophet say when you live for someone else you're looking heaven in the face it's so simple saints it it's not explaining the seven thunders or the third poll it's right here just the prophet said after he preached those great messages he said now just be simple live simple christian lives said just leave a live a plain christian life let the light shine from you amen and minister to people minister to people at work at school you can help people amen so sometimes we're looking way up here and it's right down here where we live and you'll see the spoken word you'll see the supernatural you just do the simple things so he said you know confess your faults one to another and uh you know uh corey ten boom she you know the story she she had uh hidden they were hiding the jewish people in their home you know the story and she uh they they were found out and and uh they were betrayed by someone they trusted and uh so they were sent to the to the to the work camps and her father was aging and he died very shortly after after going there her sister was ailing and sick and wasn't in good health and couldn't take the the cold and the bitterness of the camps and she was slowly dying and they had a pact together they stayed together they smuggled their bible in and uh this one time she said uh you know she was uh they were hiding the bible under their pillows and i just thought it was so striking that her sister said you know she said i can't take corey said i i can't take the lice anymore the lice in the beds i i can't it's driving me crazy and and then her sister said no no don't look at it that way because she said because of the lice the guards can't get the bible they don't want to touch the bed you can thank god for a lot of things but i don't know if i've ever thanked them for lice but her sister had faith she had a faith and that kept corey going and that boosted her faith see we can help one another and she just she just maintained it and anyway finally she you know she saw a guard uh when her sister was too weak to to do the shoveling and things they were making them do that a guard started to beat her and beat her with the shovel and beat her and beat her and she couldn't get that out of her mind that scene of him of the guard beating her sister and then she died shortly after that so uh later in a when she said to her her sister said before she died corey when you get out of here you tell this you still tell the story of christ around the world and she did she did they managed quite a quite a good testimony too and you know she said she was in one of the meetings and and one of the the guard actually that was beating her sister came to that meeting in america had been converted and he said i have become a christian or she said i forget it was a man guard or a woman guard but said i have become a christian and i want to ask you to forgive me i want to ask for your forgiveness and she looked at her and she said it just went back in her mind that day seeing her sister being beaten like that and frail as she was and she she just looked at him for a few minutes and then all of a sudden she said she just reached out her hand she just put her hand out and she said i forgive you and she said when she did that she said the love of god just come right down through her and flowed to that that guard there's nothing more powerful than that amen there's nothing more powerful than the love of god oh love of god how rich and pure how measureless oh my you know i thought i thought about that testimony because i i think in this day and age when you know the love of many will wax clothes cold we get so closed up we get hardened we get hardened among ourselves and that love doesn't flow but i can feel it here today i can feel it here today can you feel it my spirit testifies amen that's what we need let that love of god flow amen and the one thing we have in the message we have a message complex of unforgiveness we get we get to a place where someone crosses us the wrong way and it's just that's it that's once that's twice you know we we we have to get over that we have to get over that and not not be unforgiving be forgiving jesus taught us in his prayer he said if you don't forgive you will not be forgiven amen god help us to do those things and you know we we believe we've got the the cream of the crop amen we believe we got the message for rapturing faith we need to just do we need to just build that stature of a perfect man just keep working on that amen on that patience have patience with one another amen pray for one another have temperance and and godliness around one another respect even if you disagree we can still love each other we can have differences the prophet said we can disagree bitterly and still love i was just listening to brother perry that testimony he gave about when brother branham and him were driving and uh brother branham was telling him about some brothers that had done some bad things and then he and then later in the day he says well maybe if we had enough time we could go over and see them and brother perry said i'm surprised at you brother branham you know after what you said he said i felt like giving him the fivefold ministry you know a couple of those fivefold ministries he was riled up he got him riled up and i probably would have been too my flesh would have got the better of me you did that to the prophet and uh so he said i'm surprised at you brother perry he said you know it's not our our attitude towards them you know god's love is our attitude to towards them not their attitude towards us or not what they've done to us and i remember him just saying that and he said you know brother perry was saying i'm i'm getting there i'm learning right have have we come any further now amen that's what it takes he said you know you be uh you have anything odd against a brother you're danger of hellfire right so we've got to be loving people forgiving people and take our stand at the same time believe the word and preach it pure preach it like it is preaching with the gloves off amen but yet loving and i appreciate you know some of the brothers that i've had fellowship with here and and their spirits amen the christ-like spirit they've had and i'm a little rough sometimes around the edges and i you know i get around brothers like that and i say oh boy i'm coming short i wish i had that kind of that gentleness that love that spirit of christ that reaches out amen and i want i want to be see we can't we can't all be the same and and that's why we need a body and we learn from one another and we we give and we take amen and it helps us as a body and we supply every need to to every joint amen so bear with one another bear one another's burdens amen pray for one another you well you want no faults the prophet said uh confess them don't hide them don't hide them confess them amen and and and god will give you the power and strength to overcome them especially when you have people praying for you amen so i i've had to do that many times and um so so when it it comes to our weaknesses so we fix fixate on them they become complexes and you know a complex sometimes we're trying to sometimes we have a complex that we want to try to change someone else instead of changing ourselves we want to change the other person and and sometimes that's that's the way you know you learn as you go on in life and you get older and you're married a long time you know you're not going to change that person sometimes you're going to have to put some some honey on the salt block you know you're going to have to do something to to change the atmosphere you know and uh that that's you know if it if you're always trying to change someone then you've got a complex it's not them it's you got the complex you're trying to change the other person and when we should just pray for them pray for one another i pray for my wife she prays for me amen and like i said we're not perfect but we we love each other and we've got christ and there's nothing we can't settle there's nothing we can't forgive hallelujah isn't that wonderful amen that god god could give you brother a greater thing besides salvation he give you a godly wife amen a godly husband amen so it's when we fixate you know it's like those two sisters remember those two sisters the prophet talked about one of them was uh they were i don't know if there were twins but one of them uh lost her mind and the parents came asked brother brandon to pray and uh he knew the child from from a young age and she had lost her mind where the other sister was tough she was weaker and she was teased about her hair about her her belief as a christian and the way she behaved no parties and no makeup and no pants and different things she was just it all came just overwhelmed her and uh she she kind of lost she just kind of lost her mind and the prophet prayed and prayed with her and nothing happened and then he was just sitting with her uh at the end of the at the end of the testimony and he was sitting with her and the spirit of the lord just showed him that he called her name i forget what it was mary or something he said mary because she was bumbling off on weird things and saying demonic things and all kinds of things and he said mary when you were young you always wanted to marry a preacher and she just looked at him and she came out of it said that was her complex because she was rejected and she had all that against her and and she would she thought she'd never get married to a preacher that drove her into a complex amen and she lost she kind of lost her spirit just drifted her mind just drifted and and she came right back to herself amen because it was something that was laying there all the time that no one else would have known amen but the holy spirit knows he's the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart he knows what we've been through as ch children he knows what we've experienced he knows our scars he knows our wounds he knows our complexes he knows our weaknesses but with the holy spirit we can overcome anything in our lives but we don't want to let it get to that place amen talk to somebody amen a lot of times i know situations and and people that in the message around the message that committed suicide and if they just could have talked to somebody and i know a a personal friend uh that that that it happened to and my son that was not serving the lord at the time was staying in my home and uh this this this believer was having huge issues and a real complex and i was away i was in africa somewhere and and so he was staying in my home and and my son he sat down with my son on the bed and they talked for about he said my son said about two hours and he told him a lot about himself and he just unburdened himself to my son and and sam i know if you know sam furthermore he's he's a real listener and he's just such a level-headed headed kid you know and i believe god's dealing with him but uh god had him there for that brother just to listen to him and tell him things that he wouldn't have told anyone else and it just unburdened him so we don't know you know just sometimes be a listener we got to be a listener sometimes oh i've heard that before be a listener maybe they need to to talk they just need to talk amen and and we're so me oriented we have a me complex so i'm talking about complexes now we have a message come we have sometimes an unforgiveness complex amen it becomes a complex and we need to get over that elijah had to get over that to see the rapture and i hope we don't i hope we can get to that but that's where satan will make his stronghold when he becomes a complex don't let anything become a complex to you you got a difference with a brother a difference with a sister don't let it be a complex go out of your way to be nice to them go out of your way to do something kind to pray for them amen like the prophet did like the prophet did he said just pray for them so something that we sometimes over you know we we don't see but we're handed down things sometimes that it's not our fault it's not your fault some of this is and and you know people blame themselves and the devil just loves that game and he jumps on that condemnation and then there's no victory there's no joy there's no ministry in your life and you're not overcoming and you're stagnant you're staying in the same place why because you've got to overcome that thing you're going to overcome that thing i know one brother that was in edmonton and he was a native man and he was i really believe he was called to preach the gospel but he had such an inferiority complex like he would fellowship with me and a few others but he didn't like to be around believers he didn't like to be in in even in church it was hard for him but he you know he did start to speak a little bit but he had to overcome that thing you see he had to overcome it and and because he wouldn't i said his name was keith and i said brother keith you know what the prophet said if you have a complex about something he said just do the opposite you don't like to be around people be around people force yourself i mean you don't have to be the social butterfly but you should press you should force yourself to get to get in the company of the saints i mean that's where we rub one another and that's where we strengthen one another amen so uh it can do a lot of harm and he never went in the ministry i i believe later he just you know he just kind of faded away but i definitely believe that that there was something in his life you know and uh i believe brother branham's brother had the same call in his life brother branham said he had a call in his life to preach the gospel also but because of complexes women popularity or money right there are three things and so we got to watch out for so many times the satan finds a stronghold in weaknesses look at judges chapter six we won't turn to it but you know the story of gideon he had a complex he had a victim complex because you know they would come in the philistines and take all the all the food and everything and he was he was thrashing wheat behind behind something hiding and and then the angel of the lord comes the prophet comes and speaks to him what you know thou mighty man of valor and and and gideon says judges six you can read it for yourself you know if god is with us where be all his miracles why isn't he delivering us from this you know and that question becomes a you can make that if you keep that attitude questioning god why why me why this why now it becomes a complex and and you become a victim don't be a victim don't be a victim to satan amen we don't have to be we don't have to cower under amen greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world and give thanks in all things amen like corey timber they she started to give thanks for the likes because she could have her bible give thanks in all things oh my i was i was taught that by a widow woman and sister billy how many remember sister billy she used to come to the convention oh sister she was you were very close to her amen and she taught me that when things would go wrong i was a border and i boarded with her for three years when i come to the lord she taught me many things she was in the prophet's meetings she saw visions she had supernatural things happen very supernatural things and she taught me that all things work together for good amen even even the bad things praise the lord praise the lord i smash my car up against the fence praise the lord praise the lord she just oh my she just had so much patience and patience and virtue and knowledge and temperance and godliness oh my so uh sometimes you know we become victims don't take on a victim mentality we're not victims we're conquerors we're overcomers we're victors not victims don't be a victim of circumstance well i'm a victim of circumstance well like the man said you know well how are you doing today well not too bad under the circumstances he said what are you doing under there what are you doing under there amen just stretch stretch your faith amen practice these things practice overcoming amen those athletes that are over in the olympics right now they focus on their abilities and their their their sport that's all they focus on and they're at the top of their class amen and we are the top and we've got to focus now and and exercise our faith stretch our faith amen do something out of the box out of your comfort zone like esther and then she had to do something out of her comfort zone she had to get out of her comfort zone to to see who she really was amen so we don't want a victim mentality so uh we can have we could mention lots of different things you know but we're not slaves we're not inferior we're not we're not slaves to fear or lack or want you know where we don't have to be amen we don't have to be we our our father is is rich in houses and lands the he holds the wealth of the world in his hands amen like i mentioned this morning my you know 1.6 million that that was a pretty good little offering you know and i thought you know what i wish i could have got that you know at the time but it wasn't for me it was for them and usually that's the way it is that's the way it has to be and that's why we need one another so we can overcome by the blood of the lamb amen and it just takes courage it just takes courage now saints take courage others have overcome you know whatever whatever uh thing it is that's that's hindering you whatever weakness it is don't let it become a complex amen whether it's for yourself or someone else don't let someone else's complex get get in between you and god because that tries to get on you and and i refuse it i'll just refuse it i just take the opposite just like the prophet said and i've had to do that saints from experience i've had to do that all of my life take the opposite to how i feel to how to the way i look at myself what i know about myself and brother greene said that many times i'd rather believe what he said about me than what i know about myself amen amen so we've got to we can overcome and we just need to take courage because there's people here that have been delivered of things that that maybe you're struggling with and over and have overcome you know and i the the brother that witnessed to me uh he had a problem with cigarettes and he witnessed to me and and uh and i came to the lord and and and the lord just you know wondrously birthed me into this message into his spirit and and he was just so surprised that god used him when he was kind of in a backslidden state but we're looking at the outside god mark is looking at the inside the cigarettes didn't mean a thing and i remember him at the back he'd run from the back to the front to the altar just fall down and and just repent and god take this thing away from me see so sometimes people are struggling with something that you know someone else has overcome god's delivered others he can deliver me amen but if you fixate on it you know i think there was a testimony brother branham said there was a man a brother in the hospital that had a problem with smoking he said i'll go in and give him a carton of cigarettes you watch and see and baptize him amen because he saw something in him amen so sometimes you see something it's not what you see a brother or sister sometimes struggling with something in the flesh or you know a sin or something don't don't don't magnify that just pray for them just pray for them and say you know greet them brother sister i'm praying for you you're on my heart make an effort to reach out and make that phone call you be the one don't wait you be the one so many people wait and they miss the blessing you know and that happens so often and i think we're we're we're you know we're living under our privileges that way and to see the spirit of god move in our midst amen and hear those testimonies just wonderful today i i really enjoyed the testimony about hadessa and i just think praise god good on you good on you sister amen you're an overcomer and you had the saints behind you praying say pray for one another that you'll overcome and confess those faults amen so whatever it is if it's smoking or lust or nervousness another thing that can become a complex nervousness i'm a very nervous person and i just made that way i'm very nervous and i'm very you know uh i wouldn't say i'm not i'm not the same as some other stoic solid uh calm brothers that i'd like to be like but i'm not that way i'm just the nervous type and god uses that somehow he uses that he can get glory from that so we don't want to get a complex about that comparing ourselves among ourselves ministers can do that and get a complex about it we can have a big complex about it and i just refuse it i just refuse it you know the disciples you know one time they had had that going among them who's the greatest who's the greatest preacher in the message complex i don't want that complex if god uses me in a little corner and he can he can get some glory out of my life praise god that's what i want i don't want to be the best preacher amen i i i know that's that's a complex and that that affects all of us you know and we we've got to be big enough to admit it you know we can talk about our good points and our strong points but sometimes there's weaknesses that we have and we're just better off being honest and and console you know confiding in someone confiding in your past fighting in the ministry confiding in brothers and sisters and that's what the blood is for amen if we just take courage now it only takes one person to take courage and then someone else can overcome amen i was in a excuse me i was in a on a train in washington coming back from the congo and we we got into a snowstorm there and it paralyzed the city and so flights were canceled and we had to get back to the hotel and then we couldn't everything was stranded and buses all over the streets and we were trying to take this train and uh we're on this train and there was this this uh big man that come and drunk on the train and uh he was a very big man and uh he he was threatening people on on in our car and he threatened this young girl and accused her of staring at him and what are you staring at and his voice was really loud and he became very intimidating and and you know i was sitting there and just fear gripped the whole the whole car the train and everybody was just frozen because he he was in control that spirit that demon spirit was in control and uh we didn't know what he was going to do next you know if he had a knife or what what he was going to do so there was this little man at the back little little guy at the back he got up real slowly you know you just get up and just walk slowly up behind him where he was sitting and he just grabbed him by the neck and he put him in a hole he must have been a soldier because the hold he had him in was he was he was he was paralyzed he couldn't do nothing and so he pulled him up out of the seat and he brought him out to the to the aisle where he brought him right where i was sitting right beside me and i'm looking up at him and he's holding this big guy and you know i thought this guy has got courage i got to help this guy so i stood up and i grabbed him by the other arm the big guy so that he couldn't struggle he was struggling he said let me go let me go i won't do nothing he said i'm not letting you go for nothing and i thought this guy's got courage i'm going to back him up so when i got up and i grabbed him then someone else got up and then someone else got up and then we were all over them we all had them so we couldn't do nothing so i learned something there because it only takes one person to take courage and and start it do something and you know when that door when we came to that next stop and the doors open in the subway or whatever and the doors open automatically he's saying you know let me go let me go he said no this is your stop he just let him go outside and he rolled on the ground you know i'm not i'm not advocating violence but you know you know what sometimes if you the prophets are like peter cartwright i must fight if i must win increase my courage lord then pray for him after hey man but you know i just thought just one person one little guy that didn't look very intimidating at all but he knew what he was doing he knew what he's doing he had courage so take courage take courage and do what god puts on your heart to do you young people at school take courage be an example be a testimony amen just if it's even praying over your food i remember in a camp in an oil field camp i prayed over my food and that's what attracted people and i think there was a whole family came in from that just for me praying over my food they said what do you believe what you know and so they see something they see the way you dress the way you act that's a testimony that that's the works of god and and you know and if if there is something there they're gonna they're gonna come nothing's gonna stop them amen so uh let's uh do we have that powerpoint let's just go to this quote oh that's not it perfect strength and perfect weakness here's something that'll console us here's something that encourages us out of weakness and humility god chooses people to build his kingdom out of if we ever get to heaven if we ever stand in the presence of god with his church we'll stand with a bunch of people that's been weak rejected cast out by the world and knoweth nothings amen i'm one of them i'm one of them i'm so glad that i can say i'ma know it nothing isn't that strange god's liking us to sheep the sheep is the most helpless thing there is we've got to become that way there's nothing so insufficient in defense that of defense than the sheep a rabbit can run a squirrel can get in a tree a dog can bite a lion can tear a horse can kick a bird can fly but sheep are stand helpless that's the way god wants us realize that we are totally insufficient perfect strength perfect weakness then god takes that person begins to mold himself into that person makes his hands do what god would have his hands do wonderful makes his lips speak with god god's lips would speak because they're not his their gods he begins to build a character begins to take this weakness and make his own self he brings us here in the earth but then we're so educated so smart you know the quote and he talks about cain's lineage but he said but god sides with the was weak and humble that's how god used them that's god's opportunity god wants an opportunity in our lives so we just got to continue it it's in humility isn't it it's really in humility and we we've got to humble ourselves sometimes we've got to humble ourselves from our from our message pride a lot of that going around message pride that we know more that were that we we understand more we have more revelation you know and there's no one going to heaven but us sort of attitude there's millions going to heaven there's millions outside the city there's millions that will come into the city some of my family may come into the city and i'll greet them they name may never be bride they may never see this message but they'll be there i believe they'll be there hallelujah god show me they'll be there amen so and don't look at denomination don't look at they're catholic they're this they're that don't look at that amen if you give a cup of cold water you will not lose your reward amen and there's many that'll be there that you wouldn't think would be there amen so we we want to get over that so perfect strength and perfect weakness so sometimes it's just things that are in the grab bag of life that we we get and uh you know it's like elijah he was a man of like passions and like moses and like all the prophets abraham you know they all had had weaknesses that they had to overcome amen to him that overcometh abraham had a weakness he had a me complex he wanted to save his own height so he was going to give away his wife and watch another man take her my abraham the father of the faith amen you say well they didn't have the holy ghost but they were they were god's people they were elected it was god's servant he was god's prophet amen but he had human weaknesses amen and so did moses like i said earlier and you know that's where we need to see the deity and humanity the conflict will always be there but we have a promise to the overcomer that if we we overcome as he overcame as i have overcome jesus had a ma as a man had to overcome he had to overcome popularity he had to overcome women he had to overcome money he could have had it all he could have been set up as a king amen but he had to overcome that so elijah was in first kings 19 we read that you know after his his his uh he got into a me complex elijah did and and so did our profit so did brother branham he had a complex and i i don't know if i got that on a on a quote um here recently i was going to just to quit preaching that people wouldn't hear me they just kept on doing the same thing and i got discouraged i built a complex another place he said i got depressed and then right at the end he said of it to know that i'd left a lot of sick people see because of his complex a ministry not both prophetic but the teaching of the word and praying for the sick you let a man drop dead right there on the floor then brought him back to life for confirmation that that was true you always confirm your word so he's saying here and you all know that that god dealt with him severely on that amen but he he says himself that he built himself we do it to ourselves it's not someone else it's not your brother it's not your sister it's not the pastor some people have complex with a pastor or ministry it's not them it's yourself look at yourself look at your attitude is it christ-like it you know that love it doesn't bend on their attitude towards you it's your attitude towards them that's what the love of god is based on so brother branham he had to go through that and god corrected him amen he said i built myself a complex and it's he said it's so easy to do we don't realize it's so easy to do amen i think we're getting it amen how many has complex how many has weaknesses amen we're all human we have some weakness and god can fortify us by his word putting on the whole armor of god and and and and pressing and pressing for it like i said we have to the the the righteous they take it by violence the kingdom of god is taken by violence the kingdom of god is within us and it's taken by violence we have to war and struggle and it's it's it's it's a dark place sometimes and i'm speaking from experience because i i myself had a complex it was a me complex same one elijah had it was a me complex early in my life early in my ministry i thought it was all about me i thought i had something to do with it i thought i i had something to do with the gift and i was a little bit proud and i was a little bit oh great i'm a great kind of guy you know i'm a real great guy you got to like me you know i i find no fault in myself quite a complex you know it's either inferior complex or or you're on the other side of it you think too much of yourself and uh i know it sounds funny now but it you know i had to learn a great lesson and you know i left my family behind i left my children behind i left my wife behind and i almost lost my marriage you know those are the hard things to say those are not the easy things but they're hard things but i want to be honest i want to be honest with god and i want to be on i want to meet him with a pure heart and i want to overcome those things and i had to you know pride what is it the pride cometh before the fall and uh and you know and when i realized i'd left all that and almost lost my marriage i i just said well i'm i'm just going to quit preaching and i i wanted to stop i i think it was close to four years and and you know it was my pastor that that we we you know god used him and and uh restored me see i say that that's hard to say but you know it's true it's true we're living uh it's not it's not this is not an imagination or or something we put on we can't put things on we can't try to be something we're not and you know when you you try to be the big guy you try to be you know a super super preacher or you know whatever god uses you you give me a little gift and you know and i i'm thinking i'm a little better than someone else i soon found out you'll fall right on your face god god will share his glory with no man amen and he'll and and that's his love that's his love but god god is a restorer if you fail if you backslide if you did something god is a restorer he can restore you amen and and he did that for me and i could go into that testimony a little deeper but i just feel that you know you know as ministers we need to be honest and we're human we need to overcome ourselves too and you know and what would we be without the people what would you be what ministry would you have amen it's the bride's ministry it's the bride's ministry that's what it is when you realize oh it's all about him it's all about you lord it's all about you amen then then all those complexes and things starts to fade away and he gets greater and then all things are possible god has used me more brother aaron since that time you know when i consider myself backslidden than he has ever in my life now because i learned something i learned how great he is i learned that it's all about him and anything i've done any any good i've ever done was him there's none good but god there's no one good amen none of us are any good but god in you is great and you're an overcomer and i've had to overcome things in my life complexes amen of the way i was brought up and things and you know we've all been like i said we've all been in some way scarred or hurt but you can't let that become a complex it takes you out of the body it takes you away it was going to take the profit away and and he said i let the sick lay and and there and the and he would hear those calls coming you know he was still called to do that and god dealt severely with him he said you'll become a bum and your wife will leave you you think that would have happened yes it would have happened he wasn't just mincing words he said you do what you're you want to do and this is what's going to happen amen and and that that was the same for me i realized god took me to a point where i said oh this is now a time of decision i need to decide what i what i want what i really want from life that it's not all about me and the attention i could get or or you know that i'm such a great guy or or you know many different things that come into the emotions and and things that you know it's hard to explain you know men let me tell you something men sometimes i was at that time i was in my 40s early 40s and i was going through a midlife crisis and men go through that too men there's times when men go through that and and they want something else they want something special they want you know something outside of themselves and they you know and it it's just hard to explain because it's like your wires get crossed everything gets crossed in your mind and and you you kind of have a spiritual amnesia and you know i know you're looking at me funny but i'm just human and and you know that was a very painful time that was a very painful time for for our marriage and for our family but god is a restorer we believe don't we that you know that the prophet elijah restored you know god can restore people no backslider god can restore people just have some confidence have some mercy have some grace have some patience amen put yourself in their shoes amen and if it was you so um i don't know i i didn't plan on bringing that out but that's that's probably why i'm preaching this message because i've had some experience with it and i know god god can you can overcome we can overcome anything saints we can overcome any complex any weakness satan has put on us anything we've had from birth or before our birth in our parents or our grandparents things that were passed down to us so the elijah's biggest complex was his me complex read when you get home read chapter 19 of first kings and how that elijah goes and runs from jezebel and finds himself in a cave and uh god passes by in a wind and a an and an earthquake and a and a lightning and different things and yet god was not in it it was only the effects of his presence passing by all those supernatural things that are out there are only the effects of what god's done in this generation everything you see on television and tv evangelists and different things that's the effects of what god has done in this generation and they weren't the real thing you know i'm not looking for those things amen and i'm not looking for you know okay i'm not looking for the prophet's cave that doesn't matter to me that was for the prophet amen that's a special thing god had for the prophet amen i'm not looking i've been i've had the privilege to to to go to jeffersonville and sit in the prophet's chair and and and go to his grave and and be at sunset and up at sabino and i'd like to go again here right away but you know it's where is the god of elijah right where is the god of elijah he's here he's he's he's been there all the time waiting patiently in line amen he's waiting patiently sometimes and we're looking for him here and there you know but god was not in it but he takes you know elijah out of that depression he goes into a depression under a juniper tree and and he he takes them up to the cave and he says the lord says what doest thou hear elijah sirs what is the time he's asking him his prophet a question sirs what is the time what are you here for what are you doing here why are we still here in 2022. you know what what what it was a still small voice that asked that question elijah comes out oh i've been very zealous for the lord our god they've thrown down his altars they killed the prophets they've done this they've done that and i'm the only one preaching the message i'm the only one that has the right doctrine see i can say that with a smile that's a complex that's a bad one we're the only church we're the only ones in the middle of the road don't get that complex god's got his children all over the place and you know when he asked he asked elijah he said what what is it you know what are you doing here and that was his answer wrong wrong answer so he goes on then he comes to him again asks him the second time obviously the first time was the wrong answer but he gives the same answer again i've been very very zealous for the lord our god you know they've thrown down the altars they slain the prophet and i only remain a prophet i'm the only one that's in the middle of the world it's not it's not even us four anymore it's just me myself and i three of us so you know uh he had that complex that's why i said elijah had a complex and god just ignored him the second time and he says i'll give you the answer to this question because the the answer was in the question and sometimes that's the way it is the answer is right in the question you're here for a purpose we're here for a purpose and and we've got work to do you've got work to do you've got overcoming to do we've got overcoming to do and there's something we need to overcome in our lives that's what i want i want to overcome myself i want to overcome my spirit my thinking get it out of the way so god can speak and god can use me and god can god can win souls win a soul for christ amen the greatest thing we could ever do or support a believer so when he asked him the second time and he says the same thing again god says now elijah here's the answer go and anoint hazel amen to to be king i think it was and jehu to be king over israel hazel hazel and jehu and elijah he said go anoint elijah to be prophet in your stand and that was his answer that was god giving him the answer that elijah it's you're not the only one besides that i've reserved me 7 000 that believe this message that are preaching this message around the world i've reserved me and you don't know anything about that because that's another group elijah was the type of christ elijah was the type of the bride right so god was saying elijah you don't understand there's an elijah to come elijah christ and the bride elijah christ and the bride christ and the bride elijah there's a bride coming there's a bride coming of christ and we're living in that time now and we need to see who we are we need to overcome these little things and and and elijah had to overcome his his me complex his message complex in order to see that he needed to see that he he needed god had to take him right down to face that it's not about you elijah it's about them it's about the bride there's a bride coming to this there's an ephesians to this amen and and elijah had to see that before he could get rapturing faith amen and that's that that was very uh uh revealing to me that that elijah could actually not understand that that there was something else after his ministry amen there was something to come amen and and that's what we're fulfilling now saints we're fulfilling a lot of things that the prophet saw in vision we are fulfilling those things now and those things are some of them have been fulfilled and people are still looking for them looking out there for something to come when it's already done it's already fulfilled and we're right at that door now so elijah had to come to that place where it wasn't about him same place i had to come to same place every one of us will have to come to that that christ can you know that he can be the the preeminent one and and the focus and the center of our lives amen um you know a lie once elijah saw that and he goes and anoints jehu and hazel and then finds elisha he found a bride right he finds elijah and then and then elijah follows him and it took 10 years the prophet said for elijah's coat to fit elijah it took a long span of time for that to happen but it happened and then they come down to to a place where elijah says unto elijah he had overcome his complex he understood now what it was what he was there for he was there in preparation for a bride to call a bride out that's what he was there for and then he left the scene amen and that's and that's where we're at today it it christ is in bride form he's here today in the fullness of his of his spirit in bright form and a many member bride christ is here in his fullness now amen not not to come someday when it happens but now he's here and and that's what i see around the world amen and i see it here that the spirit of god is is is moving in his people amen and they have a desire to be to be closer to god and to and to see god move in their lives and and and to see god move in our church amen so elijah started to to tell that to elijah when he had overcome and he said elijah what what can i do for you and elijah elijah asked a hard question give me a double portion he said you've asked a hard thing but if you see me when i'm taken if you understand the the the process of the rapture because there's gonna be a rapture amen and i'm gonna i'm gonna leave this world now if you see me if you endure if you stay with the message stay with the messenger the message and the messenger are one stay with that message endure to the end if you endure and see this you'll you'll have that portion you'll have your portion amen and so i i can just see them amen as they walked and and the sons of the prophets see after after that battle with elijah with himself was over amen where he had to realize it was not about him after that was over then then he could relax and now his retirement was in sight amen are you looking for your retirement i'm looking for mine amen and i you know and he had a he had a great plan great retirement plan and i can see him brother jeremy uh if you'll if you'll just come for a minute brother jeremy did you just come up for a minute i can see elijah with elisha and them walking towards the jordan and elijah said unto elijah as they strolled rather if i'll take your arm we'll just they just strolled they were just strolling he said now i want you to understand he said have you ever have you heard my message on things that are to be yes yeah have you heard my message on the rapture yes perfect faith yes why we're not a denomination yes amen deceived church by the world yes leadership elijah these are elijah these are the things you have to understand and you have to understand that i had a complex about myself but it wasn't about me it was about him amen amen and they stroll together and as they stroll together the scripture says they talked i wonder what they talked about why he talked about rapturing faith how to get rapturing faith and they just strolled together and the sons of the prophets stood afar off right they set a far off and they were just elijah and elijah were just one together and i'm sure he took his arm i'm just almost sure of it amen and they they become so alike elijah and elisha you couldn't tell the difference the sons of the prophet said now the spirit of elijah rests on elijah it's the same spirit that christ and the bride so that's where elijah had to come to in order to to have rapturing faith and elijah had to do his part he had to stay with the messenger all the way all the way across jordan amen even while the sons of the prophets stood afar off and criticized amen and didn't believe didn't really believe in a rapture you know people people in the mess they some of them say they're believing in a rapture i wonder i wonder by their actions are they are we really looking for the coming of the lord are we just playing church are we just getting comfortable oh my but elijah said unto elijah have you heard my messages on false anointed ones at the end time on have you heard my message on leadership amen have you heard my message on communion or what else will you bill me have you heard those messages have you have you have you heard what the spirit was saying or is saying to you about that that's more important than oh i listen to that one i listen to that when i listen to that one but now what are you hearing now what doest thou hear elisha not elijah what does thou hear elisha bride what are we doing here what time is it if we could just settle ourselves and just concentrate on god in our lives god in my life amen and focus on that and focus on on that love amen and having a loving christ-like spirit amen god will do the rest god will reveal the rest he'll reveal the big things and i i can just imagine as as elijah talked to elijah along the way that it just as he as he rehearsed those things that god did in his life and in his ministry he was rehearsing them that it all came together for him just in a moment in the twinkling of an eye it just that's the way it'll happen saints it won't be a wind or a thunder or an earthquake amen it'll just be a real simple thing the prophet said the rapture will be so quiet it's not a public show it will not be a public show and i don't believe it'll be on the internet i don't believe it'll be on cnn and they'll be watching the two prophets in jerusalem on cnn and rejoicing but we're not going to see it on those things get away from those things get away from the world amen shun it shun it as much as you can i know we have to live and do business but you know what we don't have to be is distracted let's not be distracted amen and in that moment it all came together it was a simple moment and i'm going to close with that and say you know it's been a privilege to minister to you and many times you come on our hearts and we pray for you and we pray for you here brother aaron and and the leadership here and and the ministry we pray for the perfect will of god and i was just listening to uh brother green's testimony it helped me so much about the the will of god he said you know when you brother branham told him that story about the three lights did you get all those lined up you get something that's scriptural amen and that a man has a burden and it's scriptural he's called to do that and he's got the burden for it and god will make a way right god will make a way maybe the musicians could come god will make a way god god will god will do what he he wants to do we just got to let him do it and believe that he can do it and uh you know i want to encourage you just to just keep believing amen you know god god has a plan amen but we don't want to get that's why i ministered on complexes sometimes we get a church complex we we can have you know things that we we disagree on or whatever and then it brings it doesn't bring unity amen we want to overcome those things so then god can do his part but we need to do our part amen i know you're all you all want that you all want the perfect will of god amen so we want to just we'll continue to pray for you and hopefully we can come back again and minister to you i know my wife she she likes arizona and uh especially in the winter time and uh we'd like to be here you know six months of the year five or six months of the year soon maybe even starting next year so we'll see how that works but pray for us that that would be the desire of our hearts amen and there's just something there's something akin there's something there's something real and then that i i i find i you know when i'm here i feel closer to god somehow i just feel closer to god it was maybe something that was in my heart as just a little boy remember when the prophet said he wrote those little poems and things you know i did that when i was a kid too i wrote poems and and i liked the mountains and things like that that we never had back east but there i am in the west it was always the west going west i had to go west i was on my way to spain when god stopped me in edmonton i had big ideas i owned the world amen but you know god said no this is where i want you amen and from there amen and there's it's always been a desire of our heart to come and spend some time here so god bless you pray for us we'll pray for you what was i saying there about god will make a way where there seems to be no way do you know that one you know that brother aaron could you start that i thought we'll make a way where there seems to be way where there seems let's stand together [Music] he will be my god [Music] he is make a way let's sing it with all our hearts god make a way he'll make a way seems like there's not a way [Music] amen we can't see wait for me he will be my guy hold me closer with love and strength for each new day he will make a go way hallelujah do you love him amen he'll make a way tomorrow amen my i've seen god do so many supernatural things we could be here all week god is a supernatural god amen he'll make a way for you tomorrow he'll make a way on your job he'll make a way with the boss you know the boss the boss that was over me when i went to africa he gave me wages while i was away all that time then i got quarantined for two weeks when i got back because i was in southern africa and he said no he said no you won't pay nothing we're paying everything the boss the company god will make a way god god owns it all amen and he can make a way financially if you're in a financial situation tonight he can make a way for you amen if you're in domestic marital whatever it is he can make a way through that thing hallelujah he's god and he's strong and he's powerful and we're now the prophet said we're now in the power of the resurrection we are now living that power of the resurrection is living through us amen and all things are possible just have that attitude keep that attitude no matter what the circumstances amen he can make a way and he's made that way he is the way the truth and the life amen you know the prophet said we're we died with him we were buried with him we raised up with him and now we're sitting together in heavenly places in christ jesus amen he said when you died with him he said you paid for your own sins in him isn't that powerful you pay you don't have to pay you don't have to go through a tribulation you were in him as an attribute the bride came out of his side you died with him when he died you were buried with him you rose with him you overcame with him you're more than a conqueror you can do it you can overcome amen whatever it is facing you this week and we face a lot of things we face a lot of challenges but you can overcome it amen as we pray for those tonight that were sick and and needy and brother aaron's relative god can make a way for that amen god can take away shingles amen he can cure anything amen when i didn't say it this morning but when i was in africa you know these signs follow them that believe there was a there was a lame woman she was crippled and and i just looked at her and she just had the face i laid my hands on her and she got up and started to dance and run run down the around the whole thing with by herself there was blind people there there was mentally mentally deranged people there was witchcraft it was all those things but god you know at that point and i'm not saying it to glorify me but at that point by the mark nothing was impossible what whatever it was could be healed whoever had the faith to come could be healed so it's just god challenges our faith sometimes and when you get in that moment i wish it was always like that but it's not but when you get in that place that everything is right everything's under the blood and everything's perfect and you're where you should be nothing can be impossible amen whatever it is you have let's let's i just want to pray with you let's bow our heads father as we bow our heads tonight and i've been a little long i know father i've long winded but god i just pray that your people have been gracious and patient father tonight and i pray you'll reward them father lord may they go with here with these nuggets lord and lord may they shine them up father and lord may they rejoice lord in in knowing god that there's nothing that you don't care about in our lives and there's nothing you don't know about no weakness no complex that you don't already know about it and like elijah the prophet said as he was under that depression you gave him the softest the angel with the softest hands came just an angel lord and ministered to him stroked his head and fed him water and food lord gave him strength for the journey ahead father i pray that will be their portion tonight father i know there's people here lord that are lord that are grieving father in that lord that may be depressed and father i pray for them lord jesus they're wounded or scarred from things in the past lord i pray that your spirit lord tonight would soothe those things pour in the oil and the wine lord i pray in their lives just now lord as we go from this place may they feel the touch of the master's hand that's what elijah needed that's what we need lord a touch of your hand tonight on our lives god as we confess our faults and i've confessed mine over the pulpit lord and and the prophet
