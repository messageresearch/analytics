[39:04] lord that grace
[39:08] which we know is unmerited favor
[39:12] but you chose to do it that way lord
[39:15] and we appreciate it
[39:18] if we would
[39:20] compare our life to yours lord we'd have
[39:23] no chance
[39:26] but you took our place
[39:29] you you wrapped yourself in a in a body
[39:31] of flesh
[39:34] and you walked
[39:35] on earth for 33 years
[39:38] you were tempted you were tried you
[39:41] you had to deal with the thoughts and
[39:43] and the feelings and everything that
[39:45] that goes through our body lord through
[39:46] our mind
[39:48] so that you could be touched by the
[39:50] feeling of our infirmities today lord
[39:53] and you said i'll stand in their place
[39:57] you had to make that decision lord as
[39:59] you there in gethsemane and you said
[40:00] father
[40:02] if it be thy will let this cup pass from
[40:05] me
[40:06] and then you said not my will
[40:08] but thy will be done lord
[40:11] and because of that we're here today
[40:12] lord
[40:14] we have this opportunity
[40:17] to serve you to love you
[40:20] to fellowship with you to walk with you
[40:23] to be called mrs jesus christ today lord
[40:26] we just want to say thank you lord we
[40:28] appreciate that
[40:30] now we just ask you to continue the lord
[40:32] in the blessing and being with us in the
[40:34] rest of this service
[40:35] in jesus christ's name amen thank you
[40:39] you may be seated
[40:40] thank you
[40:42] just a couple of announcements and
[40:44] things a couple of things too
[40:46] go over and
[40:49] good to be back in the house of the lord
[40:50] this morning
[40:53] we had the opportunity to go up to
[40:55] flagstaff for
[40:57] kind of a long weekend and
[41:00] it was a blessing up there it was a good
[41:02] time
[41:03] and
[41:04] all the rain fell on the east side of
[41:06] flagstaff we were on the west side so
[41:08] the
[41:09] there was no trouble getting around we
[41:11] did take a ride out to that side and it
[41:13] was where there was a lot of storm
[41:14] damage and all
[41:16] but um the saints of god were still in
[41:19] church anyway so
[41:21] it was a wonderful fellowship
[41:24] we had reserved a hotel through the
[41:27] flagstaff they had set some rooms
[41:30] available
[41:32] and at a really good price and brother
[41:34] steve robson called us called me on
[41:37] thursday and he said
[41:39] how many of you are coming up i suggest
[41:41] me and my wife
[41:43] and he said well we we would like to use
[41:45] your room for a family that needs
[41:47] another bed
[41:49] and if you don't mind we're going to put
[41:51] you up in a little airbnb that'll be all
[41:53] right
[41:54] a brother has a little place here he
[41:56] said that would be okay i said whatever
[41:58] works that's fine
[42:00] so we went over there and
[42:02] probably the nicest place we'd ever
[42:04] stayed before
[42:06] no other atmosphere except it was a
[42:08] brother's place
[42:10] very nice very good spirit
[42:13] and then the brothers told brother steve
[42:15] tell them brother that there's no charge
[42:18] and
[42:19] i didn't arrange that but he took care
[42:21] of it
[42:23] so in our appreciation for that and and
[42:26] all um
[42:28] my wife said we're going to clean this
[42:29] really well
[42:32] so we did
[42:33] and the brother sent a note back through
[42:35] brother steve he said tell the brother
[42:37] specifically tell the brother
[42:40] that that was the cleanest we've ever
[42:42] seen our place after somebody's left
[42:45] and i said
[42:46] send texts back to brother stephen i
[42:48] said tell the brother it was the sister
[42:51] more than the brother
[42:52] but yeah she said now you're going to do
[42:54] this and you're and it was so nice we
[42:56] had a wonderful time good fellowship up
[42:59] there
[43:00] brother darrell ward spoke on
[43:03] friday evening and brother aaron mcgary
[43:07] saturday late afternoon
[43:09] and brother ferguson on sunday
[43:12] and brother daryl saw me and he come up
[43:15] with aaron how's the tabernacle going so
[43:17] we shared some things and he says
[43:19] you call me anytime and i'll come
[43:22] i said well thank you lord i didn't even
[43:23] have to ask
[43:25] so lord willing and i told some of the
[43:27] brothers we'll be nice to you we'll wait
[43:29] till maybe october
[43:31] it's pretty warm down there but they
[43:33] said you just called us whenever we'd
[43:35] come down and help brother aaron mcgarry
[43:37] the same way we had a good time of
[43:39] fellowship so
[43:40] appreciate that and then of course when
[43:42] you get back and
[43:44] got to do all the catch up on the work
[43:46] so wednesday turned out to be about a
[43:47] 13-hour day just to try to get caught up
[43:51] but there's work
[43:53] there are those that are struggling the
[43:54] lord's been good to us so
[43:57] and then one other thing just um
[44:00] to bring to your attention uh
[44:03] the wedding brother enoch peterson
[44:05] getting married
[44:08] the first third weekend of
[44:10] september and there's
[44:12] quite a few folks are planning on going
[44:14] lord william we're going to go
[44:16] and when we kind of looked it over
[44:20] a lot of people will be gone all the
[44:21] musicians the song leaders overall
[44:24] so we're we're looking at what we're
[44:26] going to do that week and there's a
[44:27] possibility of canceling the service if
[44:29] there's not the staff to do that but
[44:32] just kind of a heads up coming up about
[44:34] a little over a month from there
[44:37] and
[44:38] myself and my wife we always had been
[44:41] taking
[44:42] a week off in october when she was have
[44:44] her week off from school and we would
[44:46] celebrate our anniversary and anything
[44:48] else and take a week off but
[44:50] because she's not working anymore we can
[44:52] take that time
[44:54] and um
[44:55] and lord willing we'll go and then
[44:58] take some more time and maybe see that
[45:00] part of the country that we haven't seen
[45:01] since i was a little boy and don't
[45:03] remember any of it but
[45:05] so just kind of a heads up on that
[45:07] coming up in a while but
[45:09] lord has been good to us
[45:12] brother ferguson gave some testimonies
[45:14] on sunday
[45:15] there are people still giving their
[45:16] lives for this gospel
[45:19] and when sometimes we think we have it
[45:21] hard
[45:22] and you hear the testimonies
[45:25] it's just not the same he spoke of a
[45:27] brother the crossing from kinshasa to
[45:30] brazzaville there crossing the river
[45:33] and and he could not get a ride across
[45:37] because it's it's there was a war going
[45:39] on
[45:40] and they finally were able to get
[45:45] the brother across
[45:47] and when he got to across into brazil
[45:49] and had to go to where he was going
[45:51] nobody would take him on a taxi
[45:53] because there's a war going on
[45:56] so
[45:58] they've one of the taxi drivers says
[46:00] i'll take you and they got to the just
[46:02] where they were about to be there
[46:04] and he says now stop and listen
[46:06] he said you could just hear the firing
[46:07] going across the road that they were to
[46:10] travel across
[46:12] he said but he got me over there
[46:14] but he said this is why nobody will
[46:17] bring
[46:18] because there is a war going on on this
[46:21] and he said not only that but there was
[46:23] a brother from kinshasa that crossed
[46:25] over
[46:27] and they asked for his id and when they
[46:29] he showed his id they didn't accept him
[46:31] though they put him up on the tree and
[46:32] shot him and killed him right there
[46:36] we don't have much to complain about
[46:39] but our brothers and sisters so we keep
[46:41] them in prayer
[46:43] you know
[46:44] there is
[46:45] satan has will never give up
[46:49] he doesn't know
[46:51] that he knows what his end is going to
[46:53] be
[46:54] and he'll never give up but greater is
[46:56] he that is in you
[46:57] than he that is in the world so
[47:00] it was it was a good good weekend
[47:02] wonderful time
[47:03] got to meet a family that we had never
[47:05] met before and it's
[47:07] we would look at as a by chance
[47:10] we went to have the breakfast that they
[47:12] do on saturday morning
[47:15] and there was one table left there with
[47:16] one sister sitting on it my wife had
[47:18] gone on ahead and she went and sat next
[47:20] to the sister
[47:21] and they got to talking so i went and
[47:23] sat next to her and then her husband
[47:25] came
[47:25] had never met them
[47:28] well they know the petersons both jordan
[47:30] and martha they were back in florida
[47:32] with them
[47:33] they also attended a time with brother
[47:35] watkins church
[47:37] they knew the shorts that came from here
[47:40] brother newton bennett they were there
[47:42] and here we've never met each other
[47:44] and he began to ask some questions
[47:46] because he said what's going on in
[47:48] tucson we don't hear nothing about it
[47:50] so for about an hour of fellowship
[47:53] we got to share what god is doing and
[47:55] his words were praise god we've wondered
[47:57] about these things
[47:59] he said what happened after brother
[48:00] greene passed away what happened after
[48:02] this but thank god he said that there's
[48:04] still a people that believe
[48:06] so sometimes you think it's perchance
[48:09] brother ronnie you might have said why
[48:10] did this happen to me but that was so
[48:12] you could give a testimony this morning
[48:15] to remind us that jesus christ is the
[48:17] same yesterday today and forever and
[48:20] would you be willing to say lord use me
[48:22] as an example
[48:24] use me for a reason let somebody else
[48:26] see god in my life you know
[48:28] and then so
[48:30] i praise god that it we had we had a
[48:32] good time we enjoyed ourselves we got to
[48:34] meet some new folks
[48:36] brother aaron mcgary and the message
[48:39] that he spoke on on saturday i would
[48:41] love
[48:42] for us to hear that as a church and we
[48:44] talked about and there's a possibility
[48:46] of them coming down and ministering it's
[48:48] about being in battle
[48:50] being in a war
[48:52] and you have to battle you have to war
[48:55] but what will your attitude be
[48:58] how will you let it affect you
[49:00] and and the the place he brought is do
[49:02] you let it get you hard
[49:04] and and not being able to touched and
[49:06] feel anymore
[49:07] because you're so tired and wounded and
[49:09] it reminded me and he brought it up
[49:12] of those with amnesia after the war
[49:15] and he says you take them back to where
[49:17] they used to be where they were and the
[49:19] memory becomes the familiar parts and
[49:22] and sometimes
[49:23] you just have to go back to this
[49:26] and begin to open it up and read it and
[49:28] something just begins to speak back to
[49:31] you
[49:32] as as i was preparing
[49:35] with some notes and some things and i
[49:37] had some thoughts in my heart my mind
[49:39] and i was trying to find
[49:41] something i know brother branham said
[49:43] and sometimes when you're searching you
[49:44] don't put to put it the right way and it
[49:45] won't come up
[49:47] and i couldn't find it
[49:49] so this morning as i was preparing and
[49:52] getting i turned on the message what
[49:54] house will you build me it's about 34
[49:56] minutes long i said i've got enough time
[49:58] to listen to that well what we're
[50:00] preparing for church
[50:02] and
[50:03] within about
[50:04] five minutes brother branham says that
[50:06] which i was looking for
[50:09] and i realized lord you're mindful
[50:12] i searched for it yesterday for a while
[50:14] i just couldn't find it but i knew he
[50:16] had said it
[50:17] and so then i opened up scripture of the
[50:20] day you have scripture of the day on
[50:21] your on your phone you have scripture
[50:23] today on your computer
[50:25] and david says let the words of my mouth
[50:28] and the meditation of my heart
[50:30] be acceptable in thy sight oh lord my
[50:33] strength and my redeemer
[50:35] and so just i just appreciate that god
[50:37] being so mindful of us that way and
[50:41] i listened
[50:42] to brother daniel
[50:44] heaven's service sunday morning
[50:46] and i really appreciated that
[50:48] i was that was good and i talked with
[50:50] him yesterday and he was going to be up
[50:52] in phoenix today ministering
[50:55] and so lord bless them where they're at
[50:57] today
[50:59] i didn't hear yours yet brother lyle but
[51:02] we will
[51:04] how many appreciate god's grace and
[51:06] god's mercy
[51:07] amen
[51:08] you know and and
[51:10] you you read different things you hear
[51:11] different things all day we
[51:14] this past week with steven and myself my
[51:17] boss and dan the other
[51:20] the other guy that works with a
[51:21] subcontractor was worked with brother
[51:23] jerry mcfadden for years has always
[51:25] speaks well of your dad
[51:27] just just he said it was
[51:29] i still remember them asking me at work
[51:31] do you have any more jerry mcfadden's at
[51:32] your church that we could use
[51:34] the ability to do the work and the
[51:36] attitude and the atmosphere that they
[51:37] create walk in brother jerry working
[51:40] away singing at the top of head is his
[51:42] voice
[51:43] nothing between my soul and my savior
[51:46] you know you walk into somebody else and
[51:49] their radio station is blasting and this
[51:51] is going on but to walk into where a
[51:53] believer's working and there's a good
[51:55] atmosphere
[51:56] so it was a hard week all the things
[51:58] that we had to get caught up on and
[52:02] because of all that has happened the
[52:04] last two years due to covet and and the
[52:06] issues and everything that's fallen
[52:07] behind and
[52:09] we were getting into some of those
[52:11] houses that
[52:12] well the one house i was in on friday
[52:14] they had been waiting seven months to
[52:16] get their master bath shower and
[52:18] everything back together
[52:20] how many would wait seven months
[52:23] you know no i'd want it done today
[52:26] another house that me and brother
[52:27] stephen worked
[52:29] all day
[52:30] and they've been in their house for
[52:31] about six months waiting for stuff to be
[52:33] completed and only about half of it came
[52:35] in
[52:36] so it's frustrating
[52:38] you know but it was all said and done we
[52:40] got the work done
[52:41] you know and we're able to go on so we
[52:43] give god thanks for that but you know
[52:46] there's a lot of frustration and a lot
[52:47] of hard hard times my son-in-law
[52:50] amos and abby the air conditioner went
[52:52] out but the part won't come in for two
[52:53] more weeks to fix it
[52:56] and we're used to being able to hit a
[52:57] switch and everything turns on
[53:00] but he's still with us you know
[53:02] sometimes it is it is hard or we get
[53:05] frustrated
[53:06] but we just have to remind ourselves
[53:08] but for the grace of god there go i
[53:11] in another situation my brother ronnie
[53:14] said you know
[53:15] yet when he finished a shower his eye
[53:17] was fine we serve a risen savior so
[53:22] this morning we just have a a simple
[53:24] thought but god's word is true
[53:27] you know sometimes
[53:29] and i've said this a few times you've
[53:31] probably heard me say it
[53:33] you know we want the the depth of the
[53:35] word we want and every part of the word
[53:37] god of god is effective
[53:40] and brother brandon just say that in
[53:42] this message he said after the opening
[53:44] of the seals and that's what i was
[53:45] looking this book became a new book to
[53:48] me
[53:50] and and he talks about it even when he's
[53:52] going to preach on the seals he said if
[53:53] the angel of the lord had not come into
[53:55] the room
[53:56] i would have preached them wrong
[53:58] he was reading what the other men had
[54:00] larkin and he mentions the man that and
[54:02] he was going to preach it that way
[54:04] but this was the unveiling of the word
[54:06] and god then sends his angel down to say
[54:08] this is what it is
[54:11] but i find in in just in in talking with
[54:13] different folks and and different
[54:14] ministers and and
[54:16] as we were all sitting in the minister's
[54:18] office there with
[54:19] brother aaron and them brother
[54:22] stephen asked us all to sit up front
[54:24] because it was going to be a a full
[54:26] saturday's usually the full day there
[54:29] and uh so he made sure he met us at the
[54:32] door and took us in so we couldn't get
[54:34] in and sit down
[54:35] and we just began to share things as
[54:37] ministers there was about 15 of us in
[54:39] there
[54:40] sharing experiences and all and all of
[54:42] us will admit there are hard times
[54:45] but all of us also said but he's kept us
[54:47] through them
[54:48] he's brought us through them he's met us
[54:50] he's taking care of us
[54:52] you know
[54:53] and and
[54:54] in ephesians and i don't believe you
[54:56] have this scripture i don't think i gave
[54:58] it to you there brother matt ephesians 4
[54:59] 13 but maybe you could pull it up
[55:03] and just something that came in and i
[55:05] just want to share this before we get in
[55:07] ephesians 4 13
[55:12] till we come in the unity of the faith
[55:14] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[55:17] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[55:20] the stature of the fullness of christ
[55:24] and sometimes we look at that word
[55:26] perfect
[55:28] means
[55:29] really means is as it should be
[55:33] but we look at ourselves and i say lord
[55:35] i'm not how i should be
[55:37] what your word says but i'm striving for
[55:39] that i'm desiring that
[55:41] a complete a whole
[55:44] i was thinking about it
[55:46] brother branham crossing on over to the
[55:47] other side and he's still in his body
[55:52] if you listen to him talking he's saying
[55:54] those feelings weren't there that he was
[55:56] expecting to have
[55:58] but they were on the other side they'd
[56:00] been glorified they'd stepped into that
[56:02] other theophany already and brother
[56:04] branham all he says i can't explain it
[56:06] to you all i can say to you is don't
[56:08] miss it
[56:10] how do i ask you to say
[56:12] but but here's paul saying till we come
[56:14] into the unity of the faith and of the
[56:16] knowledge of son of the son of god unto
[56:18] a perfect man unto the measure of the
[56:21] stature of the fullness of christ here's
[56:24] paul the first uh
[56:26] first stage messenger saying we've got
[56:28] to come to this it's something but it's
[56:31] not it's not a thing that he said you've
[56:33] got to come to it you're in trouble if
[56:34] you don't he's saying you've got to come
[56:36] to this but greater is he that is in you
[56:39] the one that is able to perform it
[56:41] because without him you're not going to
[56:43] do it
[56:44] you know just
[56:46] we all know those things and stuff like
[56:48] that at times that we can be happy we
[56:50] can be going and then something happens
[56:52] boy and our mood changes in a moment
[56:54] you know um
[56:56] this morning i um
[56:58] i i got up and and my wife always tells
[57:01] me take the clothes out and i'll iron it
[57:04] so i got up took a shower and i went
[57:05] over to get the clothes
[57:07] and the the coat and the pants are there
[57:10] but the shirt's not ironed
[57:13] and
[57:14] which she usually does sometimes i do it
[57:16] myself
[57:17] so i i don't know how she's going to
[57:19] take this but i didn't do it mean i went
[57:22] and i said and what about the shirt
[57:24] and she looks oh i forgot
[57:27] i just left it there
[57:29] and now the the
[57:31] reaction is mine now
[57:33] how do i react to that
[57:36] and i just laughed and i went and ironed
[57:38] it
[57:39] now it's under the coat so you really
[57:41] can't tell
[57:43] you know because sometimes iron and she
[57:44] says like oh you didn't do that party
[57:46] you missed this part
[57:47] but sometimes you know a reaction to an
[57:50] action
[57:52] and and just thinking about that how we
[57:54] react to things that happen to things we
[57:56] go and paul is saying we're going to
[57:57] come to the measure of the stature of a
[57:59] perfect man in the fullness of one who
[58:03] even though we're touched by the feeling
[58:05] of the infirmities we can have the same
[58:08] reaction as christ and say i'll bear it
[58:10] i'll go with it i'll help you i'm
[58:13] willing to share that
[58:15] it says here noah webster define unity
[58:19] as a meaning a a condition of harmony
[58:24] you know and and to to see some of those
[58:27] things that even brother branham said
[58:28] about it
[58:30] uh
[58:31] the condition of and it's not just faith
[58:33] but the faith
[58:35] many people have faith
[58:37] but where is your faith based on
[58:39] based on this government
[58:41] based on on on this situation
[58:44] the the boss of your work he's going to
[58:46] be able to keep it all no it's based on
[58:48] the word of god the only thing that
[58:50] doesn't fail he says
[58:52] and he said it's the word in us
[58:55] that eternal part of god that he placed
[58:57] in us before the foundation of the world
[59:02] there wasn't a thing that says when you
[59:03] get to this point brother lyle you've
[59:05] earned it
[59:06] no it was in you already
[59:09] that will spring forth with the very
[59:11] life of god it will grow within our
[59:14] souls until we show the exact life of
[59:16] christ living in flesh again through us
[59:21] see he was that first example
[59:24] but he said see you're going to come to
[59:26] that same plane but i'm just the first
[59:28] fruits i'm just the wave offering
[59:30] there's another harvest coming in behind
[59:32] us
[59:35] and brother branham says this that's my
[59:36] message to you church that's
[59:39] you that's a union spiritual union by
[59:41] the word that you're dead to those old
[59:44] husbands you're born anew don't try to
[59:47] dig him up he's dead
[59:49] if you're a born-again christian that
[59:51] little germ that was predestinated to
[59:54] you it's the word coming on word on word
[59:56] on word onward and come into the full
[59:59] stature of christ that's right and then
[1:00:01] he says this so he can come get his
[1:00:04] bride
[1:00:05] now we're just ready for one thing
[1:00:08] that's the coming of the lord
[1:00:10] that's my desire how that's your desire
[1:00:13] also and to think of that waiting on
[1:00:15] that one thing for the coming of the
[1:00:17] lord the invisible union of the of the
[1:00:20] bride of christ
[1:00:21] and and this was a thought that went
[1:00:23] with this and i'm going in a certain
[1:00:25] direction here
[1:00:26] um reading between the lines i was
[1:00:29] reading some things where brother
[1:00:30] brandon was talking about reading
[1:00:31] between the lines and he's talking about
[1:00:32] when sister
[1:00:33] branham would send him a letter when he
[1:00:35] was gone and i put the kids to bed he
[1:00:37] said but i know what she's saying
[1:00:38] because i know her
[1:00:40] and i was thinking about reading between
[1:00:42] the lines
[1:00:44] and there's only one author
[1:00:47] of this book
[1:00:49] do we know who that is
[1:00:51] was it moses authored this book
[1:00:54] no it was the holy spirit that authored
[1:00:55] this book
[1:00:56] who gave them the inspiration to do
[1:00:58] there's only one author of this book
[1:01:01] and when and we we we say reading
[1:01:04] between the lines what is it
[1:01:06] but i find that so many times and i've
[1:01:09] experienced this
[1:01:10] where you're talking to someone they're
[1:01:11] reading between the lines they said the
[1:01:13] holy spirit has revealed this to me
[1:01:16] and this one says it and this one says
[1:01:18] it this one says it but all three are in
[1:01:19] disagreement
[1:01:22] and that's the hard part because you're
[1:01:24] saying the holy spirit revealed it to
[1:01:26] you this way and you're saying the holy
[1:01:27] spirit reality and you're saying the
[1:01:28] holy spirit yet it doesn't it doesn't
[1:01:30] match
[1:01:32] would not the author of the book
[1:01:35] reveal it the same way
[1:01:37] so that it performs the same
[1:01:40] does that mean that i have to say it
[1:01:41] exactly like you said no but the spirit
[1:01:43] should be the same
[1:01:45] it should bring the same result if it's
[1:01:47] the life of a lemon in the seed what is
[1:01:49] it going to give a lemon
[1:01:50] an orange what it is now brother branham
[1:01:53] says you can take that and plant it in
[1:01:55] the citrus
[1:01:56] tree and it'll give a lemon but if the
[1:01:58] original tree puts forth fruit it's
[1:02:00] going to be what the original tree is
[1:02:03] so i just just you know just some things
[1:02:05] that you hear sometimes and you
[1:02:08] you talk to folks and and different
[1:02:10] things and
[1:02:12] i'm glad glad for his grace i'm glad for
[1:02:14] his mercy
[1:02:16] because if it if it had to be that we
[1:02:18] had to score a hundred percent on every
[1:02:20] single test we would we would fail
[1:02:24] but his grace and mercy reach us down
[1:02:26] and says one more time
[1:02:28] till we come into that fullness
[1:02:31] brother brandon you have this quote
[1:02:33] there brother matt ashamed
[1:02:37] and 65
[1:02:42] brother brahm says when you have met god
[1:02:45] and the god who doesn't fail the god who
[1:02:48] does exactly what he said he would do
[1:02:51] he has always done it
[1:02:53] you're not ashamed of it then you don't
[1:02:56] have to walk back and be embarrassed
[1:02:58] about it you can tell the whole world
[1:03:01] when a man meets god talks to him and
[1:03:04] the reality of god becomes his in his
[1:03:07] heart he's not ashamed of it
[1:03:10] is it you
[1:03:12] or is it god manifesting himself in you
[1:03:16] that's what makes us where we're not
[1:03:17] ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ
[1:03:19] it's christ in us the hope of glory
[1:03:23] it's become a reality like brother
[1:03:24] ronnie would stand up here and say i
[1:03:27] asked him and he did it and i'm not
[1:03:29] ashamed of that god
[1:03:31] because he keeps his word
[1:03:34] you know if if you work with with some
[1:03:36] folks and we were talking about it
[1:03:38] here with
[1:03:40] the one one of the superintendents
[1:03:42] and and they made this comment
[1:03:45] because we picked up a lot of new work
[1:03:47] taken over jobs finishing from other
[1:03:49] companies
[1:03:51] and
[1:03:52] i said you know we're buried also
[1:03:55] there's only three of us and we're
[1:03:56] buried but you guys keep giving us more
[1:03:58] work he said but you guys come back to
[1:04:01] finish the work
[1:04:04] the other company puts it in and
[1:04:05] believes that we can never get them back
[1:04:09] to come and do what we paid them to do
[1:04:13] and
[1:04:15] i even had one person ask me one
[1:04:17] superintendent he asked me he says do
[1:04:19] you think you do your job
[1:04:22] above and beyond more that's inspected
[1:04:25] of you how would you rate yourself
[1:04:28] well i had never been asked that
[1:04:30] question i had to stop for a moment
[1:04:32] think about and i said
[1:04:34] no i wouldn't put myself as above and
[1:04:36] beyond i just feel that i'm doing my
[1:04:38] duty
[1:04:39] i'm doing what i'm supposed to do i'm
[1:04:41] doing what's expected to me
[1:04:43] and so i just said why do you ask that
[1:04:45] question it was i'd never been asked
[1:04:46] that before
[1:04:48] and he goes because you come and you do
[1:04:49] your job you follow through you come
[1:04:51] through you fix it you do this whatever
[1:04:53] that is
[1:04:54] and my thought was
[1:04:56] well that's what i'm supposed to do
[1:04:59] i don't find it surprising i don't find
[1:05:01] it like oh really
[1:05:03] i thought that's what i was hired to do
[1:05:05] come to work and day and give my best
[1:05:07] every day
[1:05:08] now that doesn't always happen but
[1:05:10] that's what we're supposed to do
[1:05:12] and so he began to tell me the
[1:05:14] performance of the other person that i
[1:05:15] had replaced
[1:05:17] he said we never saw him and the work
[1:05:18] never got done
[1:05:21] and i said well i
[1:05:23] it just didn't occur to me that that
[1:05:25] would be that way
[1:05:26] but as you get to work and say fine
[1:05:28] people are that way
[1:05:31] but i serve a living god
[1:05:33] a real god
[1:05:34] a god who said i'm going to go down and
[1:05:36] take your place
[1:05:38] i'm going to walk in your shoes
[1:05:40] i'm going to go through everything
[1:05:41] you're going to have to go through and
[1:05:43] i'm going to bear it myself
[1:05:45] so that when you ask me about it and you
[1:05:47] ask for help and you talk to me i
[1:05:49] understand exactly where you're coming
[1:05:50] from
[1:05:52] and for that's why i say i'm not ashamed
[1:05:55] of the gospel of jesus christ
[1:05:57] for it's a power of god unto salvation
[1:06:00] to everyone that believes
[1:06:03] and he's faithful
[1:06:04] brother ron he gave that testimony he's
[1:06:06] faithful
[1:06:07] he never fails
[1:06:10] he says he's not ashamed of you're not
[1:06:13] ashamed of it and god is not ashamed to
[1:06:15] call you
[1:06:16] his own
[1:06:18] and the message expectation
[1:06:22] the other quote that was on there
[1:06:24] just a little bit longer
[1:06:29] so here she come along with this baby
[1:06:31] speaking of mary
[1:06:33] walking along i can
[1:06:35] see people come by saying wonder why
[1:06:37] they're staying away from that little
[1:06:39] girl oh my look at her
[1:06:41] with that swaddling's cloth my that must
[1:06:44] be a poor kid
[1:06:45] well we're we're refined
[1:06:48] we go to a better church and we don't
[1:06:49] have to fool with nothing like that
[1:06:52] here sat an old man back there oh he had
[1:06:55] a little spot of peace in him
[1:06:57] back here i can hear him sitting there
[1:06:59] reading the scriptures
[1:07:01] all at once the holy ghost now look
[1:07:04] if god gave simeon the holy ghost gives
[1:07:06] him this promise that he wasn't going to
[1:07:08] die till he seen the christ of god
[1:07:11] the holy ghost is under obligation to
[1:07:14] see that he sees the christ
[1:07:18] then
[1:07:20] if god gave you a promise
[1:07:23] god is under obligation to fulfill that
[1:07:27] promise
[1:07:30] there you there where you can hang your
[1:07:32] eternal destination on god's word
[1:07:35] because he keeps his word i really like
[1:07:37] that right there where he said that
[1:07:40] that's right he made him the promise
[1:07:41] he's obligated
[1:07:43] he says i hope you're getting between
[1:07:45] the lines here and that's the work of
[1:07:47] the holy spirit
[1:07:48] to reveal it to you the holy spirit's
[1:07:51] obligated to the word god's obligated to
[1:07:54] his word he certainly is i'm obligated
[1:07:56] to my word and you're obligated to your
[1:07:58] word and if your word's no good then
[1:08:01] you're no good
[1:08:02] if god's word's no good
[1:08:05] then i can't worship god he says because
[1:08:08] there i wouldn't believe there was any
[1:08:11] if he wouldn't back his word that's true
[1:08:14] so then i see her moving along there's
[1:08:16] simeon he's setting their reading and
[1:08:19] all at once christ is in the temple
[1:08:21] the holy ghost had given him that
[1:08:23] promise
[1:08:24] the holy ghost knowed all about that
[1:08:26] still you see simeon sitting there
[1:08:28] reading he says simeon stand up on your
[1:08:30] feet simeon said yes lord he laid it
[1:08:33] down and that was the voice of the holy
[1:08:34] ghost i can hear him and say
[1:08:36] stand up start walking where lord he
[1:08:39] said just walk i'll take care of the
[1:08:42] rest of it
[1:08:44] and sometimes that's the hard part
[1:08:45] getting up and starting walking with god
[1:08:47] hasn't told you why or what yet but
[1:08:50] you've learned and understood enough now
[1:08:53] that when he says get up and walk you
[1:08:54] get up and start walking
[1:08:56] and that that's that that's that's the
[1:08:58] son and daughter of god he says just
[1:09:00] walk i'll take care of the rest of it
[1:09:03] how am i going to walk after i get out
[1:09:05] of this stretcher i don't know he will
[1:09:06] take care of the rest of it see just
[1:09:09] start walking see when he tells you how
[1:09:11] am i going to get out of this wheelchair
[1:09:13] i don't know but you just keep walking
[1:09:15] he'll take care of the rest how am i
[1:09:16] going to get over the cancer heart
[1:09:18] trouble i don't know just take his word
[1:09:21] and keep walking he will take care of
[1:09:23] the rest of it see he's obligated to his
[1:09:26] word that's right
[1:09:28] how am i going to tell my mother if i
[1:09:29] get the holy ghost and my daddy they
[1:09:31] belong to a different church just get it
[1:09:34] he will take care of the rest of it you
[1:09:35] see you don't have to worry about that
[1:09:38] he'll take care of it how will i face my
[1:09:40] school my playmates don't worry just
[1:09:42] keep going he will take care of that
[1:09:47] and we've all been there
[1:09:49] what's going to happen what's
[1:09:51] god said i'll take care of it i'll go
[1:09:53] with you i'll not leave you
[1:09:55] you know i've shared this with you of
[1:09:57] that young lady at school when we were
[1:09:59] working in the office
[1:10:01] and she will always wear a long sleeve
[1:10:03] even in the summer because we went year
[1:10:04] round school so he went through summer
[1:10:06] also
[1:10:08] and they asked her there's about seven
[1:10:10] or eight of us sitting in that little
[1:10:12] office just they would send us out to to
[1:10:14] take stuff out to the teachers and
[1:10:16] things
[1:10:17] and somebody asked her and she said why
[1:10:19] do you always wear a long sleeve
[1:10:22] and
[1:10:23] i knowing that she was a christian she
[1:10:24] was a pentecostal christian i've said
[1:10:27] okay now i get to hear the
[1:10:28] answer and she kind of just
[1:10:32] i didn't say a whole lot and then she
[1:10:33] said
[1:10:34] um because i'm always cold
[1:10:36] in the middle of summer
[1:10:39] and then somebody else says something
[1:10:40] and she goes and this one was to me was
[1:10:43] more embarrassing she said i have very
[1:10:44] hairy arms
[1:10:46] now to hear a girl say that that that's
[1:10:48] what would be quite a bit
[1:10:50] and i'm just waiting i'm waiting and
[1:10:52] waiting and she knows you know we've had
[1:10:53] enough conversation she knows where i
[1:10:55] stand and all
[1:10:56] and finally she just says well as a
[1:10:58] christian i believe that i should be you
[1:11:01] know dressed modestly
[1:11:03] but it took about five minutes for that
[1:11:04] answer
[1:11:05] and then she looks at me she goes you
[1:11:07] thought i was never going to say it huh
[1:11:10] i felt bad for her no question about it
[1:11:13] but i don't ever want to get to the
[1:11:15] place that i'm so embarrassed
[1:11:17] that they have to question me question
[1:11:19] me question me and ask me
[1:11:20] but i'd be willing to say because i love
[1:11:22] the lord jesus
[1:11:24] and that would be the testimony
[1:11:26] and so simeon he just tells them don't
[1:11:28] worry about it simon just get up and
[1:11:30] start walking
[1:11:31] just start doing what god has asked you
[1:11:34] to do and he'll keep you he'll watch
[1:11:36] over you
[1:11:40] ephesians 1 16 we'll get into some
[1:11:42] scriptures here
[1:11:45] and again just talking where he says
[1:11:46] here reading between the lines
[1:11:50] that's the job of the holy spirit
[1:11:53] to tell you what
[1:11:55] this means
[1:11:56] what god meant by that what this is and
[1:11:59] you can ask him you can pray saying lord
[1:12:01] i'm having some difficulty understanding
[1:12:03] what were you trying to tell me but i
[1:12:05] don't want my own interpretation of it i
[1:12:08] want to know what you said about it why
[1:12:10] you said about it why do you do this
[1:12:13] and that says and and i i just remember
[1:12:16] this and it i don't forget and and the
[1:12:18] two brothers one has passed on the other
[1:12:20] one is now a pastor and he's serving the
[1:12:22] lord and i don't know him now but years
[1:12:24] ago we were talking
[1:12:27] and we were just just young men then
[1:12:30] i didn't believe i was married yet
[1:12:32] and i just asked the two brothers i said
[1:12:34] if god is with us where are the miracles
[1:12:38] and they both turned around and looked
[1:12:39] at me and said brother we are so deep in
[1:12:41] the word today we don't need miracles
[1:12:43] god doesn't do that anymore
[1:12:47] well this heart of mind said no that's
[1:12:49] not the right answer
[1:12:51] i may not understand it but i serve a
[1:12:53] living god
[1:12:55] i know a god who's real he keeps he does
[1:12:59] and then
[1:13:00] i had never
[1:13:02] run into this also when i went to go pay
[1:13:04] the rent and the man asked me about my
[1:13:06] girls because they were little and mom
[1:13:07] always had him combed and dressed right
[1:13:10] and he asked me what church we go to and
[1:13:11] i told him he said what do you believe i
[1:13:13] believe jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:13:15] today and forever and he began to tell
[1:13:17] me that no that ended with the disciples
[1:13:19] the apostles
[1:13:21] i hear brother branham say those things
[1:13:22] but i never run into it before because i
[1:13:24] was always in the pentecostal church
[1:13:26] that said jesus christ was still the
[1:13:27] same yesterday today forever and then
[1:13:29] into the message
[1:13:30] but here someone say no but god uses
[1:13:32] doctors and psychiatrists and hospitals
[1:13:35] and that was only for the disciples
[1:13:38] well my answer finally was
[1:13:40] you've come a little too late
[1:13:42] because i've met him already
[1:13:45] and i know him to be true and faithful
[1:13:48] that's again paul says i am not ashamed
[1:13:51] of the gospel of of christ for it is a
[1:13:53] power of god unto salvation to everyone
[1:13:56] that believeth
[1:13:57] to the jew first and also to the greek
[1:14:02] that's romans 1
[1:14:03] 16
[1:14:05] i'm not ashamed of the gospel i'll say
[1:14:07] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[1:14:09] and forever he can heal a disease he can
[1:14:12] heal his sickness he can take a
[1:14:13] situation and turn it
[1:14:16] you know i i i i wonder sometimes
[1:14:22] we may be in our mind and i've done it
[1:14:23] before so you know and just say
[1:14:26] is god even interested in this would be
[1:14:28] something that god would would deal with
[1:14:30] this you know it's it's you know
[1:14:32] something as humans were doing or
[1:14:33] whatever
[1:14:35] and i just remind me thinking about some
[1:14:36] mechanical problems on a car and this
[1:14:39] and i remember that brother brandon was
[1:14:41] traveling with that that group of men or
[1:14:43] the people and the car ran out of gas
[1:14:45] and they had no place to get gas
[1:14:47] and brother branham gets a thing of
[1:14:49] water and he pours it into the tank
[1:14:52] how many of you would let me take a five
[1:14:54] gallon jug and say brother just believe
[1:14:56] it i'm gonna pour this in your car
[1:14:59] well you're not brother bran brother
[1:15:01] bran was not god either
[1:15:04] but he served a living god
[1:15:06] and he knew this god to be true
[1:15:09] and i serve the same god and i know him
[1:15:11] to be true
[1:15:14] would you be willing to take a chance
[1:15:15] would you be willing to say lord like
[1:15:17] you did for him you'll still do the same
[1:15:19] he's more than able
[1:15:22] more than able
[1:15:24] jeremiah chapter 9 verses 23 and 24.
[1:15:30] i hit about five different thoughts and
[1:15:32] i was which way i'm going to go which
[1:15:33] one i felt last night the lord just
[1:15:35] shared some things with me
[1:15:37] thus saith the lord let not the wise man
[1:15:40] glory in his wisdom
[1:15:42] neither let the mighty man glory in his
[1:15:44] might
[1:15:45] let not the rich man glory in his riches
[1:15:50] but let him that glorieth glory in this
[1:15:54] he said okay there is you're going to
[1:15:56] glory glory in this in other words be
[1:15:58] proud of it if i want to
[1:16:00] share this talk about this he says that
[1:16:03] he understandeth and knoweth me
[1:16:08] therein i know him
[1:16:11] i've met him i have a personal
[1:16:13] relationship with him he's been faithful
[1:16:15] he never fails
[1:16:17] he said that i am the lord which
[1:16:20] exercises loving-kindness judgment and
[1:16:23] righteousness in the earth
[1:16:25] for in these things i delight saith the
[1:16:28] lord
[1:16:30] and
[1:16:31] the thought that was going there was
[1:16:34] along the line of of of where we glory
[1:16:37] and what what we put our trust in what
[1:16:39] what are we willing to share and
[1:16:41] sometimes and and we hear it you know
[1:16:44] well
[1:16:45] and i can say for myself i've been a
[1:16:46] christian my whole life that's all i've
[1:16:47] ever known
[1:16:49] but i'm not any closer to god because of
[1:16:50] that than anybody else
[1:16:53] just because i said i'm a christian my
[1:16:54] whole life
[1:16:56] well i've never done that sin and i've
[1:16:58] never done this wrong and i've never
[1:17:00] done that but have you done any one
[1:17:02] you're just as guilty as the next
[1:17:05] everyone caused him to go to calvary
[1:17:08] it didn't numb wasn't covered he said we
[1:17:10] don't glory glory that we have met him
[1:17:13] and we know him
[1:17:15] that he is our glory
[1:17:18] and then he says in psalms 89
[1:17:21] verses 28 through 36 and he's speaking
[1:17:24] of david here but we know this speaks of
[1:17:26] christ
[1:17:28] because brother branham says and brother
[1:17:30] green reminded us over when you read
[1:17:31] this scripture if you don't see christ
[1:17:33] in every verse
[1:17:35] he says go back and read it again
[1:17:39] my mercy will i keep for him forevermore
[1:17:44] put your name in there
[1:17:45] and my covenant shall stand fast with
[1:17:47] him
[1:17:49] his seed also will i make to endure
[1:17:51] forever
[1:17:52] and his throne as the days of heaven
[1:17:55] if his children forsake my law and walk
[1:17:58] not in my judgments
[1:18:01] if they break my statutes and keep not
[1:18:04] my commandments he says
[1:18:06] then will i visit their transgression
[1:18:07] with a rod
[1:18:09] and their iniquity with stripes does
[1:18:11] anybody see death in there
[1:18:14] he said then i will utterly destroy them
[1:18:16] no he said i will visit them and i will
[1:18:19] as a father treat them
[1:18:24] see the difference there he says then i
[1:18:27] will visit their transgression with the
[1:18:29] rod and their iniquity with stripes
[1:18:33] but you also see if you put jesus christ
[1:18:36] in there
[1:18:37] who he visited on who bore it for you
[1:18:41] who took it for you
[1:18:43] because we have all sinned and come
[1:18:45] short of the glory of god
[1:18:47] not one of us can stand in any
[1:18:48] righteousness then he says nevertheless
[1:18:51] my lovingkindness will i not utterly
[1:18:53] take from him nor suffer my faithful to
[1:18:56] fail
[1:18:59] even though it has i have to do this
[1:19:04] he said it's not unto death
[1:19:09] my covenant will i not break or alter
[1:19:11] the thing that is gone out of my lips
[1:19:15] once i have sworn by my holiness that i
[1:19:17] will not lie unto david his seed shall
[1:19:20] endure forever and is thrown as a son
[1:19:23] before me
[1:19:25] and you go read david's life
[1:19:28] and boy did he fail god
[1:19:30] many a times
[1:19:32] but it was also speaking of christ
[1:19:35] he paid a debt he did not owe
[1:19:38] i owed a debt i could not pay
[1:19:42] he said i will not forsake
[1:19:45] that's why i say we are not ashamed
[1:19:48] of the gospel of christ
[1:19:51] for it is the power of god unto
[1:19:53] salvation to everyone that believeth to
[1:19:56] the jew first
[1:19:57] and also
[1:19:58] to the greek
[1:20:01] now we'll get into the new testament and
[1:20:03] we've gone over this before but it just
[1:20:05] came
[1:20:07] fresh to me again and
[1:20:09] we use the word hope
[1:20:12] and the scripture uses the word hope
[1:20:14] quite often
[1:20:16] and and i know that sometimes people
[1:20:18] will say well you have to have faith and
[1:20:20] not hope
[1:20:22] but you can't live life without hope
[1:20:25] without some expectation of something to
[1:20:27] take place
[1:20:29] and hope has got to become faith
[1:20:33] but i found so many places in the new
[1:20:35] testament that paul refers to hope
[1:20:38] over and over and over and i began to
[1:20:40] think about this last night
[1:20:42] we had the the grandkids over
[1:20:44] friday night and they were there during
[1:20:45] the day yesterday and
[1:20:47] i finally had to say okay you're going
[1:20:48] to have to leave uh papa alone for a
[1:20:50] little while because i've got to get
[1:20:52] some some notes ready
[1:20:54] and of course they they
[1:20:55] they love the attention but
[1:20:57] grandma was there for them so she she
[1:20:59] was able to keep them out there for a
[1:21:01] while give me a chance to just choose to
[1:21:03] look into a little bit more of this and
[1:21:04] i began to look up all the new testament
[1:21:07] scriptures that have hope in it
[1:21:09] hope and it's quite a few
[1:21:12] and so what is that hope what what is
[1:21:15] that in
[1:21:17] i i believe i got a definition that i
[1:21:20] put in here
[1:21:23] to cherish a desire with anticipation
[1:21:30] uh we probably use the word hope
[1:21:34] i hope so
[1:21:35] i hope i can do it
[1:21:36] you know we probably use it a lot of
[1:21:38] times in a wrong a wrong way
[1:21:42] but to cherish a desire with
[1:21:45] anticipation
[1:21:48] so it's more than just uh i hope it
[1:21:50] happens
[1:21:52] something in your size i have a hope
[1:21:54] knowing it's going to happen
[1:21:57] but you have to have an anticipation a
[1:21:59] desire for it they're also in in the
[1:22:01] scriptures
[1:22:03] paul uses and we'll get to but the word
[1:22:05] immutable
[1:22:07] it's an
[1:22:08] adjective it's a word that modifies a
[1:22:11] known or to make it more specific
[1:22:15] and it means unchanging over time or
[1:22:18] unable to be changed
[1:22:21] immutable
[1:22:23] god's word doesn't change with time
[1:22:26] neither is it unchangeable
[1:22:28] therefore i can place my hope in god's
[1:22:31] word and it has a firm anchor a firm
[1:22:33] hold
[1:22:34] and it's consistent it doesn't fail
[1:22:39] so
[1:22:40] looking at at some of these things that
[1:22:42] that um
[1:22:44] as i was looking at because sometimes
[1:22:45] you get a a
[1:22:47] a word or a thought and and you you
[1:22:49] think you know what the word means but
[1:22:50] you read some definitions and it
[1:22:52] includes a whole lot more
[1:22:55] you know
[1:22:56] of what god and god uses allow these
[1:22:59] words to be put in his scriptures
[1:23:02] how they translate because brother
[1:23:03] branham says
[1:23:04] this version of the bible was the one
[1:23:06] that god told them to use
[1:23:08] that's not to say that that you can't
[1:23:10] look up a word and see but when you
[1:23:12] realize what god was saying it just
[1:23:14] becomes more real to you greater to you
[1:23:20] uh romans 15 4.
[1:23:25] and these were some scriptures that used
[1:23:27] the word hope in them
[1:23:29] romans 154 for whatsoever things were
[1:23:32] written before time were written for our
[1:23:35] learning
[1:23:37] that we through patience and comfort of
[1:23:39] the scriptures
[1:23:41] might have hope
[1:23:44] because without hope you're hopeless
[1:23:48] that's pretty simple description right
[1:23:50] without hope you're hopeless
[1:23:52] as watch you know there's been a lot of
[1:23:54] flooding
[1:23:55] this last couple of weeks all over the
[1:23:57] world actually
[1:23:58] more fires
[1:24:00] we're coming driving in and i said
[1:24:03] well if you go to the scripture
[1:24:05] this world is coming to an end
[1:24:08] and and we have a hope
[1:24:11] more than a hope a blessed assurance
[1:24:15] that we'll step from this life to that
[1:24:16] life
[1:24:18] as we were driving around up there and
[1:24:20] even my wife is looking and says oh look
[1:24:21] at that where the burning went through
[1:24:23] up in flagstaff and what was once
[1:24:25] beautiful solidly full of trees is now
[1:24:27] it's a wasteland
[1:24:29] and i looked at it i said the whole
[1:24:31] creation is groaning
[1:24:34] waiting for
[1:24:35] their redemption
[1:24:37] waiting for the purity of the air
[1:24:39] waiting for for everything of how it
[1:24:42] once
[1:24:42] was we don't know that
[1:24:45] there's a pull towards that
[1:24:48] you've had some wonderful times some
[1:24:49] great times and beautiful times and it's
[1:24:51] just a glimpse of that
[1:24:53] but there's something desiring as as we
[1:24:56] drove we went up the long way just drove
[1:24:58] around to a different part of arizona
[1:25:00] and got up to flagstaff and saw
[1:25:01] different parts and you look at the
[1:25:03] beauty of the creation of god
[1:25:05] and then you drive to another whole
[1:25:06] section it's completely burned from a
[1:25:08] fire
[1:25:09] and what was once beautiful and that was
[1:25:11] just a scarred land
[1:25:13] but there's life in there
[1:25:15] because after the rains he came back and
[1:25:17] there's rain coming back up because god
[1:25:19] promised that
[1:25:21] you know but just looking at
[1:25:24] we look at that that we might have hope
[1:25:26] that there is something that says yes
[1:25:28] lord you're the same yesterday today and
[1:25:29] forever
[1:25:31] first peter
[1:25:32] chapter 1 verse 18 through 21
[1:25:36] for as much as much as you know that you
[1:25:38] were not redeemed with corruptable
[1:25:40] things as silver and gold
[1:25:43] because tomorrow silver and gold may be
[1:25:44] worthless
[1:25:46] in the sense of a commodity house change
[1:25:49] is so fast
[1:25:51] from your vain conversation your vain
[1:25:53] lifestyle how you lived before received
[1:25:55] by the tradition of your fathers
[1:25:58] but with the precious blood of christ as
[1:26:00] of a lamb without blemish and without
[1:26:02] spot
[1:26:06] who verily was foreordained from before
[1:26:08] the foundation of the world but was
[1:26:10] manifest in these last times for you
[1:26:13] who by him do believe in god that raised
[1:26:16] him up from the dead and gave him glory
[1:26:19] that your faith and hope
[1:26:22] might be in god
[1:26:24] paul puts those two words together your
[1:26:27] faith and hope your hope and faith might
[1:26:30] be in god
[1:26:32] my hope is not in this government
[1:26:34] my hope is not in my bank account
[1:26:37] well but my faith is in this but my hope
[1:26:40] is in that no paul is saying put him
[1:26:42] both in the same place
[1:26:44] and that's god
[1:26:46] put him both in there
[1:26:47] he can take
[1:26:49] a penny
[1:26:51] and make it worth a million like that
[1:26:55] and i can take a million and make it
[1:26:57] worth a penny like that
[1:26:59] because he's god and i'm not
[1:27:02] you understand that place your hope and
[1:27:04] your faith in his word
[1:27:08] titus 1 2.
[1:27:13] i like i love these scriptures in hope
[1:27:15] of eternal life
[1:27:17] which god that cannot lie promised
[1:27:20] before the world began
[1:27:24] you have to live with hope
[1:27:28] more than i hope the car starts this
[1:27:30] morning
[1:27:31] more than i hope
[1:27:33] let me just ask you this
[1:27:34] how many of you got up this morning went
[1:27:36] to the light switch and stood in front
[1:27:37] and said i hope you turn on i hope you
[1:27:39] turn on i hope you turn on
[1:27:41] anybody want to admit that this morning
[1:27:44] no we all got up hit the light switch
[1:27:49] we had paid the electric bill
[1:27:52] the electric company said if you pay the
[1:27:53] bill the electric will be on right
[1:27:56] that's kind of how it works
[1:27:59] none of us i don't think question that
[1:28:01] now if you didn't put any gas in the car
[1:28:03] and you've driven it for a couple of
[1:28:04] weeks you might be questioning whether
[1:28:05] it's going to turn on or not but if
[1:28:07] you've met the requirements of what
[1:28:08] you're supposed to do you just go do it
[1:28:12] and he says in hope of eternal life
[1:28:14] which god that cannot lie promised
[1:28:18] before the world began
[1:28:20] paul is telling it's a sure thing
[1:28:23] it's an unfailing thing it's not
[1:28:25] something you have to question god has
[1:28:28] proven over and over and over that he
[1:28:30] cares for you
[1:28:31] that he watches over you that he meets
[1:28:33] your needs
[1:28:35] well brother aaron i didn't have a
[1:28:36] million dollars in my bank account but
[1:28:38] he still met your needs
[1:28:42] god knows what some might do with a
[1:28:44] million in the bank account it could be
[1:28:46] the worst thing to happen in your life
[1:28:47] to you
[1:28:49] god knows how to take care of his
[1:28:50] children
[1:28:51] then in hebrews 6
[1:28:53] 18 and 19.
[1:28:56] this is where the word immutable things
[1:29:02] hebrews 6 18 19
[1:29:05] that by two immutable things in which it
[1:29:08] was impossible for god to lie
[1:29:11] that we might have a strong consolation
[1:29:14] who have fled for refuge
[1:29:17] to lay hold upon the hope set before us
[1:29:22] immutable unchangeable
[1:29:24] over time is not able to change
[1:29:29] he said who by god who cannot lie
[1:29:34] god keeps his word he's unfailing he's
[1:29:38] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:29:40] he's not affected by
[1:29:43] climate change
[1:29:45] i'm talking to my wife this morning
[1:29:47] there is going to be a climate change
[1:29:50] they just don't know what's really
[1:29:52] coming up
[1:29:54] but we're going to be restored back to
[1:29:55] what it was at one time
[1:29:59] you know i
[1:30:00] i don't know somebody asked me something
[1:30:02] about why does this world have to be
[1:30:04] burned up why does that have to be
[1:30:07] cleansed
[1:30:09] and
[1:30:11] on abra valley road when you
[1:30:13] no i'm sorry tangerine when you get off
[1:30:15] and go west it used to be the
[1:30:17] the county landfill there
[1:30:20] now it's a big mound of dirt with trees
[1:30:22] planted on the outside trying to make it
[1:30:24] look nice
[1:30:25] but the honest truth there's a pile of
[1:30:27] trash
[1:30:28] there
[1:30:31] and over time you get methane gas that
[1:30:34] comes out of there everything that it
[1:30:36] get that it produces which is rottenness
[1:30:40] so now they've opened another one in
[1:30:42] navra valley and it's a large dump site
[1:30:44] over there and sometimes i got to take
[1:30:45] some stuff out there and i asked the
[1:30:47] lady how long are they talking for this
[1:30:49] dump she said oh they said we can put a
[1:30:51] hundred years worth of
[1:30:53] dumping in this place
[1:30:55] that was her words to me
[1:30:57] a hundred years of trash going into the
[1:31:00] ground
[1:31:02] and i said oh for that day of redemption
[1:31:05] oh for that day of purifying why does
[1:31:07] god have to clean this place the same
[1:31:09] reason why he has to clean this one
[1:31:12] to take it back to its original state
[1:31:14] and this is what he's saying in hope of
[1:31:15] eternal life and by these immutable
[1:31:18] things things that cannot change to lay
[1:31:20] upon to lay hold upon the hope set
[1:31:23] before us jesus christ the same
[1:31:25] yesterday today and forever verse 19
[1:31:27] which hope we have as an anchor of the
[1:31:30] soul
[1:31:31] both sure and steadfast
[1:31:34] which endureth
[1:31:36] into that within the veil which
[1:31:39] entereth into the veil
[1:31:43] again paul is using the word hope
[1:31:47] rather than faith
[1:31:50] because there has to be a hope in you
[1:31:53] there has to be something that makes you
[1:31:54] get up and go again
[1:31:56] i know god will keep i've played my
[1:31:58] trust my hope my desire on what he has
[1:32:01] said
[1:32:03] my hope is built on nothing less than
[1:32:05] jesus christ in his righteousness
[1:32:10] whether the forerunner is for us entered
[1:32:13] even jesus
[1:32:14] made a high priest forever after the
[1:32:17] order melchizedek
[1:32:21] my hope is built on nothing less than
[1:32:23] jesus christ and his righteousness
[1:32:27] ephesians 17
[1:32:30] and 18
[1:32:31] 17-18
[1:32:37] that the god of our lord jesus christ
[1:32:39] the father of glory may give unto you
[1:32:41] the spirit of wisdom and revelation in
[1:32:43] the knowledge of him
[1:32:45] that the eyes of your understanding
[1:32:47] being enlightened that you may know what
[1:32:49] is the hope of his calling
[1:32:52] and what the riches of the glory of his
[1:32:54] inheritance in the saints the hope of
[1:32:57] his calling
[1:33:00] you're not basing it on what you're
[1:33:01] going to be able to do you're not basing
[1:33:03] your hope is if i can get to this then i
[1:33:05] can have that you're not basing in the
[1:33:07] hope of if i can perform this no it's
[1:33:10] his calling
[1:33:13] he's called you to this hope he's called
[1:33:15] you to what he's promised
[1:33:18] therefore that hope lies in you i know
[1:33:21] my redeemer liveth
[1:33:24] as job said
[1:33:25] without even having the revelation that
[1:33:27] we have today it wasn't required of him
[1:33:30] was required of us but he said i know my
[1:33:33] redeemer liveth
[1:33:34] and with these eyes i shall behold him
[1:33:38] something that will get you out of bed
[1:33:40] in the morning and said i can live this
[1:33:42] day
[1:33:42] because i have a hope and a living god
[1:33:46] more than a stone more than an idea more
[1:33:48] than somebody else is this that i've met
[1:33:50] him he's real he's the same yesterday
[1:33:52] today and forever
[1:33:54] amen brother ronnie
[1:33:56] we heard that testimony you say well
[1:33:58] that's a simple testimony he's jesus
[1:34:00] christ of every part
[1:34:04] you know i
[1:34:05] we we get to talking sometimes i was i
[1:34:07] was speaking to uh
[1:34:09] the
[1:34:09] one of the co-workers there and we were
[1:34:11] talking a little bit and my co-workers
[1:34:13] were one of the guys with the other
[1:34:14] trades and we began to share some things
[1:34:16] and when there's an opportunity you
[1:34:17] share the faith your hope with them
[1:34:20] you know sometimes you're in there for a
[1:34:21] minute you're out sometimes you spend
[1:34:22] half a half a day with a another group
[1:34:24] of workers and you do your best to share
[1:34:28] the hope that lies within you
[1:34:30] and why why do you feel that way why do
[1:34:32] you believe that why how can you be
[1:34:34] happy in a situation like this how can
[1:34:36] there be joy out of you how can you have
[1:34:38] such a a
[1:34:39] a positive testimony
[1:34:41] because i serve a living god and he's
[1:34:44] faithful
[1:34:45] and we were talking about him and and he
[1:34:47] said something
[1:34:50] and he mentioned that he was diabetic
[1:34:51] and i explained to him what i'd gone
[1:34:53] through
[1:34:54] i said but i serve a living god
[1:34:56] and he is more than able to keep and
[1:34:58] save and take care of
[1:35:00] and
[1:35:01] you know so i began to share him i began
[1:35:03] to tell him who this god is
[1:35:05] and why i have this hope
[1:35:07] because he's been real to me he's been
[1:35:10] and there's that opportunity to share
[1:35:11] the hope that lies within you whatever
[1:35:14] it might be
[1:35:23] we were ephesians 17 and 18 there
[1:35:28] eyes of your understanding be
[1:35:29] enlightened that ye may know what is the
[1:35:32] hope of his calling and what the riches
[1:35:34] of the glory of his entire of his
[1:35:36] inheritance in the saints
[1:35:40] he says
[1:35:42] you know
[1:35:43] somewhere here i missed a page there it
[1:35:45] is
[1:35:49] ephesians 1 we were 17 and 18 i'm just
[1:35:52] i thought i had missed
[1:35:55] missed a
[1:35:56] scripture after this brother
[1:35:58] matt was it colossians
[1:36:00] or did i skip a page there
[1:36:04] yes
[1:36:05] to whom god would make known what is the
[1:36:07] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:36:09] among the gentiles
[1:36:11] which is christ in you
[1:36:13] the hope of glory
[1:36:18] christ in you
[1:36:20] the hope of glory
[1:36:21] i'm glad it's not aaron after producing
[1:36:24] his own hope his own ability his own
[1:36:27] chance his own i hope so
[1:36:30] it's more than i hope so it's christ in
[1:36:33] you the hope of glory
[1:36:35] something in me that tells me yes amen
[1:36:39] he's done the work he's paid the price
[1:36:41] he's already met what needs to be met
[1:36:45] he goes that's my hope
[1:36:47] and and just thinking about that
[1:36:50] what what is that hope
[1:36:53] what is that that gets us up in the
[1:36:55] morning
[1:36:56] that we look at a situation and said
[1:36:58] there's something beyond that
[1:37:02] some of that is from your previous
[1:37:04] experiences with god
[1:37:06] brother branham would talk about it
[1:37:07] driving down the road he said satan
[1:37:09] would sit on the seat next to him in the
[1:37:10] car and begin to question him
[1:37:13] and say what about that
[1:37:15] what about is it really really and then
[1:37:16] brother branham would then take back the
[1:37:18] experiences that he had with god and
[1:37:20] began to say then you tell me who was
[1:37:21] that and you tell me who was that and
[1:37:23] you tell me who was caused that he said
[1:37:25] after a little while satan would leave
[1:37:27] because if you stand faithful on god's
[1:37:29] word he'll back it up
[1:37:32] and it's the same thing that we have to
[1:37:34] do the same thing
[1:37:36] when i was down when i was hurting when
[1:37:38] i was this when i was that i turned to
[1:37:40] god and he was faithful
[1:37:44] maybe a memory back when you were five
[1:37:46] six seven eight years old
[1:37:49] and god met through a prayer through
[1:37:51] whatever as a child and you know that
[1:37:53] was god and sometimes you have to go
[1:37:55] back the far to remind yourself
[1:37:58] maybe it was just this morning like
[1:37:59] brother ronnie
[1:38:01] maybe it was something that happened a
[1:38:02] while back but you're encouraged by this
[1:38:05] and this is this is what it is christ in
[1:38:07] you the hope of glory
[1:38:10] and what is christ that is his word he
[1:38:12] is his word
[1:38:14] and you begin to encourage yourself
[1:38:16] through the word of god
[1:38:18] and says
[1:38:20] job says job said i know who my redeemer
[1:38:22] liveth
[1:38:24] and you go back and and and and read the
[1:38:26] beginnings david said
[1:38:28] cried out there and and through the book
[1:38:31] of psalms like especially psalms 119
[1:38:33] standing on his word read through psalms
[1:38:35] 119 how david cries out in your word i
[1:38:38] have hoped in your word there constantly
[1:38:40] constantly brother abraham says word
[1:38:42] upon word word upon word word upon word
[1:38:44] word upon word never fails
[1:38:47] never did he throw feelings in the
[1:38:48] middle of that
[1:38:50] never did he say your bad or good
[1:38:52] experiences just stay with the word of
[1:38:53] god stay with the word of god and the
[1:38:55] word tells us to whom god would make
[1:38:57] known what is the riches of the glory of
[1:39:00] this mystery among the gentiles which is
[1:39:02] christ in you
[1:39:04] the hope of glory
[1:39:07] how many have that hope in them
[1:39:10] you know you have that hope in him can
[1:39:12] you recommend that hope to somebody else
[1:39:14] can you say i i see your situation that
[1:39:17] you call hopeless but i was there once
[1:39:20] before and i met the god of this word i
[1:39:22] met the god of this bible
[1:39:25] and now
[1:39:27] there's a hope i can't explain it i
[1:39:29] can't say do this do that do this do
[1:39:32] that and that'll give you that hope i'll
[1:39:34] just say meet him
[1:39:36] give your life to him and let him do for
[1:39:38] you what he's done for me
[1:39:43] paul peter says
[1:39:45] lord
[1:39:46] i'm going to stand with you
[1:39:48] i'll even go to the cross with you i'll
[1:39:51] not deny you and he's saying oh peter is
[1:39:54] just oh boy he's he's just oh he's got
[1:39:56] to stand he's going to take for jesus
[1:39:59] and jesus looks like turn around looks
[1:40:01] at him he says you're going to deny me
[1:40:03] three times peter
[1:40:06] the scripture doesn't record what went
[1:40:08] through peter's mind
[1:40:11] i'm sure it caught him by surprise
[1:40:12] because peter was well we know peter was
[1:40:15] pretty strong with his words quite often
[1:40:18] not me not me no lord i'm going to stay
[1:40:21] with you because you're going to before
[1:40:23] the rooster crows he said you're going
[1:40:24] to deny me three times
[1:40:29] and he did scripture says he did exactly
[1:40:32] that
[1:40:33] then peter says well obviously
[1:40:35] i'm lost i don't have a chance tomorrow
[1:40:38] i denied my very savior
[1:40:40] i couldn't even stand with in fact i ran
[1:40:42] i hid i even tried to act like the
[1:40:44] people around him that were crucifying
[1:40:46] him
[1:40:48] there's no hope for me there's no chance
[1:40:49] for me there's nothing left for me
[1:40:53] and on that resurrection day
[1:40:55] and jesus tells
[1:40:57] he says go tell my disciples
[1:40:59] to meet me
[1:41:02] and peter 2.
[1:41:05] see my hope is building on nothing less
[1:41:08] than jesus christ and his righteousness
[1:41:12] not because i was able to
[1:41:14] not because i boasted that i would stand
[1:41:16] with him and never fail him
[1:41:18] because he'll look at me he says oh you
[1:41:19] will
[1:41:21] but come on
[1:41:24] in whom he said is that that seed laid
[1:41:27] in
[1:41:27] it will bring forth
[1:41:30] what it's promised to do
[1:41:32] the musicians would come up
[1:41:35] on christ the solid rock i stand
[1:41:39] all
[1:41:40] others everything else is just sinking
[1:41:42] sad
[1:41:43] in in in our best intentions in our in
[1:41:46] our hardest want to and and i would say
[1:41:49] always have good intentions
[1:41:51] i would say live a life with good
[1:41:52] intentions you just can't always keep
[1:41:54] them
[1:41:55] but just can't because you can't keep
[1:41:57] them and throw your hands up say well
[1:41:58] i'll never do that again get up and go
[1:42:00] again
[1:42:02] but that word which is promise
[1:42:05] never fails
[1:42:08] even so
[1:42:09] come quickly lord jesus
[1:42:13] and i like the song that brother jordan
[1:42:15] had us sing
[1:42:17] justified
[1:42:20] now you know you've done it you can't
[1:42:22] take that out of his out of your mind
[1:42:26] but when he says you're justified it's
[1:42:28] not there anymore
[1:42:31] and you have to accept that for yourself
[1:42:33] and that can be the hardest part
[1:42:36] lord we thank you for your word
[1:42:41] a hope it's more than just a four-letter
[1:42:44] word
[1:42:46] it's more than just a yearning lord
[1:42:49] but it's a promise in your scriptures
[1:42:52] and your word never fails
[1:42:54] it doesn't return void
[1:42:57] there where he said it's christ in you
[1:42:59] the hope of glory without you lord there
[1:43:01] is no hope
[1:43:03] there is no no way to accomplish that
[1:43:06] for whose deeds whose goodness
[1:43:09] whose wealth
[1:43:11] or what could say this is enough
[1:43:15] no there was only one
[1:43:17] that paid the sacrifice that paid
[1:43:20] the amount or however we want to say it
[1:43:23] however we would try to say it
[1:43:25] they would say it was enough
[1:43:28] to hear you say this is my son
[1:43:31] in whom well please
[1:43:34] lord for each one of us lord
[1:43:36] we'll stand on your righteousness we'll
[1:43:38] stand on your word

[1:45:34] little questioned i've wondered

[1:45:44] that just haven't seemed to be answered
[1:45:45] yet you've wondered why

[1:46:40] than jesus christ and his righteousness
