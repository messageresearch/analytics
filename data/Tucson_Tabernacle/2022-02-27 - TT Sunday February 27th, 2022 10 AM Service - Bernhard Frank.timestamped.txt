[30:58] but to god
[31:00] is all the glory
[31:02] amen we have a prayer request from our
[31:05] brother tim cruz
[31:07] asking prayer for his mom sister tony
[31:09] she's not been feeling well
[31:11] for a few days now so we'll remember
[31:13] that
[31:14] in prayer
[31:16] also yesterday
[31:18] late afternoon we had the memorial
[31:20] service for our brother charlie zotero
[31:22] and the family
[31:24] just to keep them in prayer it's
[31:27] the events and all the the time together
[31:30] there's encouragement but then the quiet
[31:32] times and the alone times come
[31:35] so remembering them all hearing the boys
[31:37] talk about their dad or their older
[31:39] brother
[31:40] and the encouragement that brother
[31:42] charlie was to the whole family
[31:44] will be missed but jesus christ is the
[31:47] same yesterday today and forever and he
[31:49] said i'll never leave you i'll never
[31:51] forsake you i'll be with you always so
[31:54] keep them in prayer also and
[31:56] if you have a need and you say lord
[32:00] sometimes you can't put it in words but
[32:02] he knows if he'll stand here with us
[32:06] and believe
[32:07] that all things are possible
[32:10] we
[32:11] you get to read testimonies and hear
[32:13] testimonies
[32:15] and and to see the miracle working god
[32:18] do something
[32:19] and then other times it maybe seemed
[32:21] like lord where were you in this
[32:23] somebody's life they lost their life
[32:24] they were
[32:26] but that's still a miracle because from
[32:27] the changing of this life to that life
[32:30] is still a miracle and
[32:32] which reminds me and then
[32:34] sister angela boyd
[32:37] the youngest of the brother dave and
[32:40] the green family she passed away on
[32:43] wednesday i believe it was we noticed
[32:47] but if you saw her today you would envy
[32:49] her
[32:50] to be where she is
[32:52] but you have that hope but remember them
[32:54] also the green family the yarbro family
[32:57] all of them that are involved with this
[33:00] but great is our our goddess
[33:03] lord we
[33:04] we don't talk to you or or have our
[33:07] conversation with you as if we were just
[33:09] talking to a inanimate
[33:12] object something that could not respond
[33:16] gods of silver gods of gold made of
[33:18] man's hands stone
[33:21] because we can make anything an object
[33:23] of worship but you're a living god a
[33:26] personal god
[33:28] took on flesh
[33:30] you you were born in a body of flesh so
[33:32] you could walk on this earth and be
[33:34] touched by the feeling of our
[33:36] infirmities the hurts and the sickness
[33:38] and the pain
[33:39] all the discomforts the discouragements
[33:41] the questions
[33:43] anything lord that we we would feel as
[33:45] humans you understood it lord
[33:49] therefore when we ask and we say lord
[33:51] i'm hurting i'm in pain i'm troubled
[33:55] you can come lord and be our help in
[33:56] this day lord so every heart every hand
[33:59] every request lord
[34:01] we ask that you administer in in a way
[34:04] that each one would recognize
[34:06] that you're mindful of them personally
[34:08] or today
[34:10] for your honor for your glory
[34:12] and for your praise in jesus christ's
[34:14] name
[34:15] amen if you'll be seated for a moment
[34:17] there
[34:20] we have with us this morning
[34:22] young couple who just got married this

[34:42] telling me
[34:44] some of the names some of the names we

[34:49] been the most prominent name and
[34:52] took him over to meet my dad and my dad

[34:55] the folks that he was
[34:56] [Music]

[35:00] man god bless you
[35:02] and then on the other side today
[35:04] actually is my mom and dad's 67th
[35:07] anniversary
[35:08] [Applause]
[35:13] i missed it by a couple of weeks last
[35:15] time
[35:17] but it was that anniversary was we had
[35:19] been here 46 years in tucson so i just
[35:22] but i'm grateful for that so
[35:25] i'd like to just read you something here
[35:28] brother jordan i gave him the quote with
[35:30] all that's happening today
[35:32] the threat of an atomic war the
[35:35] our brothers and sisters in europe
[35:38] and that part
[35:40] under that fear of being invaded by a a
[35:43] superpower
[35:45] but there's a superpower that has
[35:47] control out of all over all of that
[35:49] and he says do not fear
[35:52] i'm in charge of this so
[35:53] brother jordan if we read that there
[35:57] there will come a time people
[35:59] when we're not gathering here for in
[36:01] vain we're only waiting for that time
[36:04] it is very very late but jesus is still
[36:07] very very near
[36:08] and his glory it's wonderful
[36:11] his name shall be called the councillor
[36:14] that city can you see it
[36:16] there is where the bride and the groom
[36:18] will settle and never again too now if
[36:21] you think it's wonderful when we drive
[36:23] hundreds of miles to sit here and feed
[36:25] on his word
[36:27] which this is only a shadow what will it
[36:29] be when we live in that city with him
[36:32] when i live next next door neighbor to
[36:35] you and when we eat of those trees and
[36:37] we will walk in those streets
[36:39] when we walk up those streets of gold to
[36:41] the fountain drink from the fountain
[36:43] walk into the paradises of god with
[36:45] angels hovering
[36:47] the earth singing the anthems oh what a
[36:50] day that will be
[36:52] it's worth it all the road seems rugged
[36:54] sometimes it gets hard but oh
[36:56] it'll be so little when i see him so
[36:59] little what will the bad times and the
[37:01] things
[37:02] that they said what will that be when i
[37:04] see him in that beautiful beautiful city
[37:08] of god
[37:09] and sometimes your
[37:11] your vision gets locked into what's
[37:13] happening today
[37:15] but help us to look that just
[37:17] around the corner over the next hill
[37:20] we'll be home so when i read that i said
[37:23] i have just have to share that today to
[37:25] remind you that god is still in control
[37:28] he never has not been in control
[37:31] even if you might question and we have
[37:33] lord how could
[37:34] the holocaust be something you would
[37:36] allow
[37:38] and brother branham actually call it the
[37:39] tender hand of jehovah
[37:42] i think most of us would think the time
[37:45] that daddy or mom
[37:46] pulled our ears and gave us a spanking
[37:48] that his hands weren't very tender
[37:51] but their intention was to get you to
[37:52] grow up
[37:54] to to to mature as a christian or as a
[37:57] human being that was their desire
[37:59] and maybe as humans we didn't do it
[38:01] right
[38:02] but he's perfect
[38:04] in how he treats us what he does for us
[38:06] what he allows us to go through
[38:09] and that's why we love him today so
[38:12] and and i've always said
[38:14] god knows everything
[38:17] whoever stands behind the pulpit to
[38:19] minister
[38:20] god saw that day
[38:23] that's that's what he said the sheep are
[38:24] mine
[38:25] i will feed them i will take care of
[38:27] them so as we stand and make our brother
[38:30] bernard frank welcome
[38:34] but
[38:35] even more so trust that the lord is here
[38:38] that he'll minister words that we that
[38:40] would encourage our hearts
[38:42] maybe would come down and say you need
[38:44] some work on this part you need some
[38:46] adjustment here
[38:48] but i appreciate this about you too
[38:50] because that's how it works you you talk
[38:52] to your children you say you're good at
[38:54] this but we can work some on this
[38:57] it's it's a growing you know we look
[38:59] back now as adults when we say that was
[39:00] dad and mom doing their best to help me
[39:03] along
[39:04] you know wanting us to succeed wanting
[39:06] us to be good children wanting us to be
[39:08] good citizens

[39:13] whose builder and maker is god
[39:16] we want to be
[39:17] uh worthy citizens of that kingdom today

[41:04] praise god
[41:07] praise god
[41:09] praise god
[41:12] praise god
[41:14] praise god
[41:17] praise
[41:19] praise god
[41:23] amen you may have your seats
[41:26] i like to greet each and every one in
[41:28] the precious name of our lord and savior
[41:30] jesus christ this morning
[41:32] and of course happy to be back in tucson
[41:36] and
[41:38] yeah it seems like i'm coming here more
[41:40] often than i used to
[41:42] but we always go there where we have
[41:44] precious friends
[41:46] and i wished i had the time to visit all
[41:48] my friends around this earth that i've
[41:50] known over the years but
[41:52] i'm sure the lord will come before that
[41:55] now we know we live in difficult times
[41:59] as a brother just
[42:00] mentioned and
[42:03] but i think that we as children of god
[42:06] know that we have nothing to worry and
[42:07] nothing to fear
[42:09] and we had
[42:11] the two years of the pandemic or
[42:14] pandemic or whatever people want to call
[42:16] it
[42:17] and
[42:18] i realized that
[42:20] the disease has taken the lives of some
[42:23] of our good friends
[42:25] some of them went prematurely some of
[42:27] them went at old age
[42:30] but
[42:31] in general the lord has been good to us
[42:34] and
[42:35] we know one thing that the day that we
[42:37] were born in this world and the hour and
[42:39] the place was not determined by us but
[42:41] it was determined by almighty god
[42:44] and if he choose the day the place the
[42:46] hour the parents you were born
[42:48] he knows exactly what is the moment the
[42:51] minute the place
[42:52] and how you're going to leave this world
[42:55] and that's why i'm so glad to know that
[42:57] our life is in his hands
[42:59] and
[43:00] whatever way he wants us to go that's
[43:02] the way we'll go
[43:04] and when and the whole thing with the
[43:06] virus came up
[43:08] yes there's a lot of people that were a
[43:09] little bit scared even among christians
[43:11] but
[43:12] the lord gave me the scripture which
[43:14] said you've not been given a spirit of
[43:16] fear
[43:17] but a power and a love and of a sound
[43:19] mind
[43:20] and and that's one thing that we're very
[43:22] thankful for that the lord has given us
[43:24] a sound mind
[43:26] and that we know that there's nothing to
[43:28] fear in this world
[43:30] and the things which are going on
[43:32] bro bran many times said watch russia
[43:35] watch russia he made the church repeat
[43:36] it you know and
[43:38] we know they're the king of the north
[43:39] and they have to play their part
[43:42] but
[43:43] i can assure you one thing everything
[43:45] goes according to plan
[43:47] and
[43:49] and that's just so
[43:51] maybe side road before forget to
[43:54] speaking
[43:55] but
[43:56] i've been reading one more time on the
[43:58] on the fourth seal
[44:00] where it said that one force of the
[44:01] earth
[44:03] lost their lives
[44:05] because of famine awards
[44:07] end of death or disease in another
[44:10] translation
[44:12] and
[44:13] you know every understanding that we
[44:16] have
[44:17] is just
[44:18] we never know in full we just look look
[44:20] partially into things but
[44:23] if i understand correctly we still are
[44:25] living under that fourth seal today
[44:28] because brother mahm said that those
[44:29] four seals cover the seven church ages
[44:32] we're still under that eagle anointing
[44:35] but it's also the time that the bible
[44:37] says one force of the earth will be
[44:39] taken away
[44:41] and
[44:42] when we see that has not fulfilled yet
[44:45] so we don't know what's coming before
[44:47] the rapture but there might be still
[44:49] many many scary things to this world
[44:51] happen
[44:53] but we're safe in christ
[44:55] and that's the main thing so we have
[44:57] nothing to worry this morning and
[44:59] from that point
[45:00] it's very sad for the people and it's a
[45:02] very shame when people lose their lives
[45:04] but
[45:06] remember there was a few plagues that
[45:08] also fell in goshen but then there came
[45:10] a time that god said to moses from now
[45:12] on the plague is only going to fall
[45:14] where the egyptians are but those that
[45:16] live in goshen they'll be safe
[45:19] so that's where we live this morning
[45:21] once again happy to be here
[45:24] and it's always a privilege thank
[45:25] brother aaron for giving me the
[45:27] privilege
[45:28] and
[45:29] this this afternoon i
[45:31] want to talk about this or speak about
[45:33] the subject learn of me
[45:36] and to talk about the meekness and the
[45:37] humbleness of a christian
[45:39] which whenever we come in difficult
[45:41] situations
[45:43] we should just keep that attitude and no
[45:46] matter what it is no matter what goes on
[45:48] in the church no matter what goes on in
[45:50] the people if we can just keep the right
[45:52] attitude things will turn out right
[45:56] so
[45:56] this morning
[45:58] if we could stand and i would want to
[46:00] read from exodus
[46:02] 25
[46:05] and
[46:07] i just want to read one word exodus 25
[46:10] verse 40.
[46:21] exodus 25 verse 40
[46:24] and look
[46:25] that thou make them after their pattern
[46:28] which will show thee in the mount
[46:31] let us pray
[46:33] heavenly father lord jesus
[46:36] we realize that we are in your divine
[46:38] presence this morning lord
[46:42] lord the last thing that i would want to
[46:44] do is to present my own thoughts lord
[46:46] god
[46:48] our lord we know that you're the one
[46:50] that moves our thoughts lord god
[46:53] that you're the one that moves our lips
[46:55] it speaks through us lord and it speaks
[46:57] to us
[46:58] and i would ask you this morning that
[47:00] you would be a help or god for the
[47:02] people that are sitting here
[47:04] as brother aaron said and this is the
[47:07] way that i see it there your sheep
[47:10] you are the shepherd the great shepherd
[47:12] lord
[47:14] would you feed your sheep this morning
[47:15] and give them the right things lord god
[47:18] and that you would receive all the glory
[47:21] in jesus name we pray amen you may be
[47:24] seated
[47:30] well
[47:32] brother roger he once gave me a very
[47:34] nice license plate it says if anything
[47:36] if everything fails go back to the
[47:38] instructions
[47:40] and it shows the bible
[47:42] and that's one thing that we know that
[47:45] we have a sure guideline for the things
[47:47] that we need to do and for the things
[47:49] that we face
[47:51] and that god he said there to moses he
[47:54] said
[47:55] you just make everything after the
[47:57] pattern that's been shown to you
[48:00] and and that's the same with our lives
[48:04] whatever we do
[48:05] if we just keep to the pattern that was
[48:07] shown to us in the word of god
[48:10] then everything will be okay
[48:13] and
[48:14] but as soon as we start to deviate from
[48:16] the pattern
[48:18] we come into problems
[48:21] and
[48:22] i myself i have a thing when i get in a
[48:25] situation
[48:26] where all of a sudden i realize i'm
[48:28] stuck
[48:30] i i say just a moment
[48:32] the only way that i can get out of this
[48:34] stuck places i have to find out what
[48:37] does the word of god say about my
[48:39] situation now
[48:42] and that's the way out
[48:44] because the reason we get stuck
[48:46] is because we don't follow the pattern
[48:48] that we just somehow
[48:50] somewhat gotten off a track
[48:52] and
[48:54] that to me has been
[48:57] a very important lesson
[49:00] now the god that we serve he's an
[49:02] unchanging god
[49:03] his principles don't change
[49:06] things that he once did he always does
[49:08] him again
[49:10] and
[49:12] that is why we can see that he is that
[49:14] all-knowing god because he never has to
[49:17] change his plan and there are so many
[49:19] examples in the bible where we can see
[49:21] that
[49:22] and
[49:23] we i just consider when god made this
[49:26] earth
[49:27] in the beginning he said that he
[49:29] separated the waters
[49:31] which were below the firmament from the
[49:34] waters that were above the firmament and
[49:36] he called the firmament heaven
[49:39] right
[49:40] now i believe the bible the way it's
[49:42] written
[49:43] and when the bible says that there was
[49:44] waters above heaven
[49:46] visible heaven and waters below i just
[49:48] believe that
[49:50] so i believe that this earth was covered
[49:52] by water rebelled for a certain time
[49:55] and the bible said it didn't rain at
[49:56] that time
[49:58] the earth was just watered by dewdrops
[50:01] but then there came a time when that
[50:03] water came down
[50:05] in the days of noah
[50:06] and we can see that the life of people
[50:08] on earth which had been hundreds of
[50:10] years before within three generations
[50:13] went down to 120 years
[50:16] now that's god's principle
[50:18] you know he put he put this earth into
[50:22] what do you call the box when a baby is
[50:24] born prematurely
[50:27] incubator he put the earth into an
[50:29] incubator he covered this with water
[50:31] around
[50:32] he had a higher temperature higher
[50:34] humidity
[50:35] he fast
[50:37] breathe it let it grow
[50:39] and then let the water come down come to
[50:40] normal condition
[50:42] well the same way he did with every one
[50:44] of us
[50:46] he put us in a covered spot
[50:48] gave us more temperature
[50:50] nourished us there brought us to a
[50:52] certain point of time then he brought us
[50:53] out in this life
[50:55] god never changes his principle of doing
[50:58] things
[50:59] that's one thing that's for sure because
[51:01] you don't have to he knows what he does
[51:03] the first time was good
[51:05] and it was right and when he do it again
[51:07] well it's got to be right again
[51:11] so he has a pattern
[51:12] and
[51:14] these patterns apply to our life
[51:16] but these patterns also apply to our
[51:18] church
[51:20] whatever we do we have a pattern
[51:23] now the church services that we have
[51:26] church
[51:27] is not organized by man church is
[51:29] organized by god
[51:31] he set it up a place of worship
[51:33] a place of prayer
[51:35] a place where the word is being brought
[51:37] forth to the people a place where sheep
[51:39] can be nourished
[51:41] he's the one that set all these things
[51:43] up
[51:45] and we also see
[51:47] that in the old testament
[51:50] god
[51:52] gave leaders to the church
[51:56] he gave him moses
[51:59] and
[52:00] i have to say that that was a good thing
[52:02] for the people
[52:04] they didn't have to take a vote
[52:06] god took a decision and he said it's
[52:08] going to be moses he's going to be your
[52:10] leader
[52:11] it was very simple
[52:14] well before moses passed away god had
[52:16] decided on the joshua
[52:19] so the people didn't have to take a vote
[52:21] or decision god had taken the decision
[52:24] for them
[52:26] but it not always worked that way
[52:29] they came to a
[52:30] time where they had judges
[52:34] and the bible says
[52:35] in judges 21 25
[52:39] he said in those days there was no king
[52:42] in israel
[52:44] and every man did that which was right
[52:47] in his own eyes
[52:50] and we can see
[52:52] that if you have a time like israel had
[52:55] a time without a king or without a judge
[52:58] things for a time could still continue
[53:00] but not for a long time
[53:04] and
[53:06] you forgive me but i'm going to speak to
[53:09] your church this morning
[53:10] i want to speak to your situation
[53:14] i want to try to share some of my
[53:15] experiences
[53:18] and
[53:19] i come to realize i'm not the young boy
[53:21] anymore i used to be
[53:24] i'm past 60
[53:27] i have seen a lot come and go
[53:30] and i'll be honest with you when i was
[53:31] 20 and my parents or 15 my parents tried
[53:34] to tell me about their experiences
[53:37] i said keep your experiences for
[53:39] yourself i'll make my own
[53:43] i know you know what i'm talking about
[53:44] but
[53:45] but
[53:46] today
[53:48] i really have come to value
[53:50] experiences
[53:52] things that we have seen
[53:55] and
[53:57] we know brother greene
[53:58] he passed away almost seven years ago
[54:02] and
[54:05] you know i've been close friends with
[54:07] brother greene and i'm not saying that
[54:08] to make myself somebody here but that's
[54:11] just a fact we've been close friends
[54:14] maybe about two years or three years two
[54:16] or two and a half years before brother
[54:18] green passed
[54:21] brother kelly hildebrand and myself we
[54:23] visited brother green
[54:26] and we said to brother greene
[54:28] brother green
[54:30] we realize
[54:33] that you will not be here forever
[54:37] and we at that time ask him we said
[54:39] brother greene
[54:41] would it not be a good idea that you
[54:42] would
[54:44] make up your mind who would be your
[54:46] successor in this church
[54:49] and would you not want to establish a
[54:51] man to be the pastor after you
[54:54] would you not want to take the remaining
[54:55] time of your life to turn the hearts of
[54:57] the church to this brother that you
[54:59] would
[55:00] want to be the pastor
[55:03] well
[55:07] it didn't go that way
[55:09] i wish it would have
[55:11] but
[55:12] you can see i was i was kind of involved
[55:14] i saw the situation
[55:17] and
[55:19] well
[55:20] laureen at that time said
[55:23] well i haven't made up my mind
[55:26] and
[55:27] and then we asked him and we said well
[55:31] you have how many options you have and
[55:33] he told us the brothers and the names
[55:34] and i'm not going to mention any names
[55:36] it's just that's just my personal
[55:38] knowledge
[55:40] but then
[55:41] after he got finished speaking and i
[55:43] said he said i said brother green
[55:46] you actually have not been telling us
[55:47] the truth
[55:49] because you made up your mind
[55:52] you're just not ready to say it because
[55:54] i heard exactly what you said
[55:57] and he said yeah he said that's right
[55:59] but he never did it
[56:02] so
[56:03] we're now at a point
[56:05] almost seven years later and this church
[56:07] has not decided yet on who should be the
[56:09] pastor
[56:11] now i want to come in with my personal
[56:13] experience
[56:14] i've been in the very same situation
[56:18] when we started our church
[56:20] 15 years ago
[56:22] we had no plan of having a church
[56:25] i wanted to have tape services
[56:28] and i wanted to attend the regular
[56:29] church that i went to
[56:31] well
[56:32] the brother that we were going to church
[56:34] with he was very unhappy
[56:36] he felt like we were having tape
[56:38] services saturday night that would no
[56:40] that would that would be just for my
[56:42] family but he was not happy
[56:44] so we started also having tape services
[56:47] and i
[56:48] never wanted to be a pastor
[56:51] and a lot of people say yeah you want it
[56:52] no that's not true i never wanted to be
[56:56] so
[56:57] i'll let certain other brothers in the
[56:59] church handle things
[57:01] i let them decide who will speak when
[57:03] and who will take care of of the of the
[57:05] song service
[57:08] and it went quite all right for three
[57:10] years
[57:12] and i faced a lot of criticism
[57:15] from other churches that said but
[57:16] bernard you're not a church because you
[57:18] don't have a pastor
[57:21] and i kind of like
[57:24] you know
[57:25] try to defend myself i said i don't want
[57:27] to be a pastor
[57:30] but then i realized that things in our
[57:32] church were starting
[57:34] to go in the wrong direction
[57:37] friction started problem started
[57:41] and then i asked myself i said lord
[57:45] what must i do what does the word say
[57:50] and then i realized that the word says
[57:53] every church needs to have a pastor
[57:57] you can't go
[57:58] for x amount of years without having a
[58:01] pastor in the church it will not go good
[58:03] because it's not according to god's
[58:06] pattern
[58:08] i hope you understand what i'm saying
[58:11] so
[58:12] then in my own case
[58:15] and
[58:16] i was i was on the platform i was
[58:19] trying to defend my position
[58:23] i said to the people i said look
[58:25] i never wanted to be a pastor
[58:27] but i at least consider myself as an
[58:30] elder
[58:31] well some people got up while i was
[58:33] speaking trying to
[58:35] tell me to walk off the platform and
[58:37] things like this so
[58:39] i kind of felt i was done
[58:42] and i said to the people that you were
[58:44] gathered together i said you know what
[58:46] i'm finished
[58:48] i go home for me this is over
[58:51] but when i drove home
[58:54] there's two thoughts that the lord put
[58:56] in my mind
[58:57] the first one is
[58:59] sheep that do not want a shepherd are no
[59:02] sheep
[59:06] and that is the truth
[59:09] if you are a sheep
[59:11] and we know there is a great shepherd
[59:12] you are his sheep but still god has put
[59:15] overseers in the church
[59:17] the office of the pastor is an office in
[59:20] the church that god has installed which
[59:22] we have to have as a pattern
[59:26] and
[59:27] so that was the first thought that come
[59:29] to me
[59:30] and the second thought was how can two
[59:32] walk together unless they agreed
[59:36] and
[59:37] so my case i went back before the people
[59:40] and i said now listen
[59:44] the word of god says that every church
[59:45] needs a pastor
[59:48] and we have all
[59:50] requisites of a church we hold services
[59:54] we baptize people
[59:55] we dedicate babies we hold foot washing
[59:58] and communion
[59:59] so we're a church
[1:00:01] and if we're a church we need a pastor
[1:00:04] and then i told the people that were
[1:00:06] there i said okay this is what i want to
[1:00:07] tell you you first have to now take a
[1:00:09] vote
[1:00:11] and i come to that voting thing because
[1:00:13] there's an interesting quote from
[1:00:15] brother branham brother brahms said we
[1:00:17] have to do it under the leading of the
[1:00:19] holy spirit
[1:00:20] and we believe that that is the majority
[1:00:23] of the people
[1:00:25] so there is a point where you the
[1:00:27] congregation come in
[1:00:29] you know we can't always
[1:00:32] blame the leaders
[1:00:34] we sometimes also have to blame the
[1:00:36] congregation
[1:00:38] because both have a responsibility
[1:00:40] you know was many times in the country
[1:00:42] they always blame the leader yes you
[1:00:44] blame the leader but what did you do
[1:00:47] you know and that's why a church you
[1:00:49] have to take a decision and i asked my
[1:00:51] church
[1:00:52] i said now here's what you need to do
[1:00:54] you first needed to have a vote whether
[1:00:56] you want a pastor or not
[1:00:59] and if your vote is no that's fine
[1:01:02] you can just go ahead as you're pleased
[1:01:04] but i will not be here to take any
[1:01:06] responsibility
[1:01:08] because i realize the word of god said
[1:01:10] you need to have one
[1:01:13] right
[1:01:14] and
[1:01:16] that's one thing i would like to tell
[1:01:17] you
[1:01:18] now
[1:01:22] looking around and sharing other
[1:01:24] experiences
[1:01:27] now that in the message we have a lot of
[1:01:30] elderly pastors
[1:01:33] but
[1:01:34] a lot of times
[1:01:36] you can never see a good transitioning
[1:01:38] happening
[1:01:40] sometimes the older pastor would come to
[1:01:42] the point that he actually can't serve
[1:01:45] the people no more
[1:01:47] he would place another man in the pulpit
[1:01:49] to take care of the church
[1:01:51] but he would hold on to the office of
[1:01:53] pastorship
[1:01:56] for whatever reason
[1:01:59] i think that's wrong
[1:02:01] i think that's wrong
[1:02:03] you should
[1:02:04] take if you can't do the job
[1:02:07] then there's nothing wrong in taking a
[1:02:10] retirement
[1:02:11] and for those that know the old
[1:02:13] testament
[1:02:16] the hebrew priest could retire at 50
[1:02:18] right
[1:02:21] so there's nothing wrong for a pastor to
[1:02:23] retire
[1:02:24] the only problem is how to take care of
[1:02:26] his finances afterwards
[1:02:29] let me say that also i talk here to
[1:02:31] message people now
[1:02:33] i've seen that i just talked to a
[1:02:35] brother
[1:02:36] over 80 years old
[1:02:38] has given all his life to be an
[1:02:40] evangelist sent out from a certain
[1:02:42] church
[1:02:44] never paid in a pension plan
[1:02:47] well
[1:02:48] now he lives on welfare and i ask him
[1:02:51] i said brother the church that you've
[1:02:53] been with for all these years
[1:02:56] now that you can't go out you're all too
[1:02:58] old to go out to preach
[1:03:00] do they give you any financial support
[1:03:05] he says no
[1:03:07] and i look at that and i said there's
[1:03:09] something wrong here
[1:03:12] you know we have to take care of our
[1:03:14] pastors also
[1:03:17] and that's a big problem i just i just
[1:03:19] put laid that out before you know we
[1:03:21] don't know how long we stay here
[1:03:23] but that's just one of the things that
[1:03:25] makes transitions difficult
[1:03:28] then i seen other case where
[1:03:31] the brother got old
[1:03:33] and he couldn't hold the pastorship
[1:03:35] anymore and the younger brother took
[1:03:37] over he was early 40
[1:03:40] but the church would never vote him in
[1:03:43] till they came to the point
[1:03:45] that he said
[1:03:47] brothers and sisters i'm going to leave
[1:03:50] well finally they voted him in but
[1:03:53] i always say look the people have to
[1:03:55] take a decision
[1:03:58] and and there is a responsibility that
[1:04:00] the church has
[1:04:02] you as a people
[1:04:04] because brother brahm clearly says
[1:04:07] the highest authority is a local church
[1:04:10] and the local church needs to vote
[1:04:14] and
[1:04:15] we're having another situation also in
[1:04:17] in our city
[1:04:19] where brother passed away but i think
[1:04:21] three or four years ago now
[1:04:24] well
[1:04:25] no new pastor
[1:04:28] there's a group of three brothers they
[1:04:29] run it as a democracy
[1:04:32] any decision in the church they you know
[1:04:34] they send emails to to decide
[1:04:38] now a church cannot be run by a board of
[1:04:40] three or four people no matter what
[1:04:41] their decision is
[1:04:43] that's the truth
[1:04:45] because but the church has to take a
[1:04:47] vote
[1:04:48] and this is what i'm encouraging you
[1:04:50] you have sufficient brothers here that
[1:04:53] serve on the word
[1:04:54] i don't know them all i know brother
[1:04:56] aaron i know brother johnson's sitting
[1:04:58] here i know brother
[1:05:00] daniel there so there's others
[1:05:02] but there must be someone among you who
[1:05:04] will be the pastor of this church
[1:05:07] and i encourage you
[1:05:09] to take the way that the word of god
[1:05:11] says
[1:05:12] have a vote
[1:05:15] and
[1:05:16] if you have a vote
[1:05:19] don't play politics
[1:05:24] that's the last thing
[1:05:27] you want to do in a church
[1:05:30] don't ever play politics
[1:05:36] i've seen enough votes canceled
[1:05:39] it don't only happen in the political
[1:05:41] field it happens in the church too
[1:05:46] you know there's a church and they
[1:05:47] should decide who should be the pastor
[1:05:50] and there's two brothers
[1:05:53] that were the candidates two brothers
[1:05:55] that served the church
[1:05:57] well
[1:05:58] all of a sudden one steps up and says
[1:06:00] the lord spoke to me this morning i
[1:06:02] should be the pastor
[1:06:05] you agree right
[1:06:08] well what should the other brothers say
[1:06:12] you hear what i'm saying
[1:06:15] you know what i'm talking about
[1:06:18] if a man comes and says the lord spoke
[1:06:20] to me i should be the pastor
[1:06:24] well you should just say you're going to
[1:06:25] be subject to a vote like everybody else
[1:06:29] don't play any politics
[1:06:33] the other thing is don't ever let
[1:06:34] anybody come from the outside and tell
[1:06:37] you who should be the pastor
[1:06:41] i've been years ago at a funeral
[1:06:44] of a brother that had
[1:06:46] a little group somewhere
[1:06:49] close to the french border
[1:06:52] and
[1:06:55] he passed away been a good servant of
[1:06:57] god
[1:06:58] then they had called one other brother
[1:07:00] to come to the funeral
[1:07:03] but then
[1:07:04] another great and honorable
[1:07:06] minister from paris came
[1:07:10] and he said just a moment the lord told
[1:07:11] me i should do the funeral and speak the
[1:07:14] word here everybody aside
[1:07:19] it's not to laugh brothers
[1:07:21] sad story
[1:07:22] so he did the funeral after her funeral
[1:07:25] he went to the home of this brother
[1:07:27] there was a widow there was a son-in-law
[1:07:29] there were the sons there were other
[1:07:30] brothers
[1:07:32] and he read the scripture my servant
[1:07:33] moses is dead
[1:07:36] we have to bring in the joshua
[1:07:40] and then he said okay is there anyone
[1:07:42] here that want to be the pastor
[1:07:44] and there was one man from the church
[1:07:46] son-in-law of the old pastor he said i
[1:07:48] feel that i would want to wish to be the
[1:07:49] pastor
[1:07:51] well there was a son of that that
[1:07:53] brother that passed away who had a
[1:07:54] church far away from that place maybe
[1:07:57] 300 400 kilometers
[1:07:59] he had his job he had his house he had
[1:08:01] the church and this man said no not you
[1:08:04] this is the one that god has selected
[1:08:07] well the brother took over the church
[1:08:11] his job failed lost his house lost his
[1:08:13] marriage wife in the world
[1:08:17] you know and i sat there i was too young
[1:08:20] but if i would see something like this
[1:08:21] today i would step in and say wait a
[1:08:23] minute
[1:08:25] you are from the outside
[1:08:28] you have nothing to do in this church to
[1:08:30] meddle in their affairs
[1:08:33] the church is sovereign you the people
[1:08:36] are sovereign you that come and worship
[1:08:39] and fellowship here in tucson tabernacle
[1:08:42] you are the ones to decide and there's
[1:08:44] nobody else from the outside to tell you
[1:08:46] who should and who should
[1:08:48] would that be right
[1:08:50] i think that is right
[1:08:52] and there's one thing i wanted to say
[1:08:54] more
[1:08:55] i actually want to comment you on having
[1:08:57] stayed together the way that you have
[1:09:00] i want to comment you that you stayed at
[1:09:02] this place and been faithful
[1:09:04] to this church that you've been all
[1:09:06] those years
[1:09:07] most of you you know yourself 40 50
[1:09:10] years
[1:09:10] right
[1:09:12] anybody that's been here 50 years
[1:09:15] see anybody who's been more than 40
[1:09:18] years yeah
[1:09:21] you stayed faithful to this place
[1:09:24] but in order to move on
[1:09:27] you have to take a decision
[1:09:31] and the decision will be of the church
[1:09:34] the decision is not a board
[1:09:37] and i could read that from the quotes
[1:09:39] where brother brahm said that the board
[1:09:41] does not take the decision the church
[1:09:43] takes a decision
[1:09:46] and who will be a candidate well
[1:09:49] let's take the bible
[1:09:52] it says in first time 3 1
[1:09:56] this is a true saying
[1:09:59] if a man desired the office of the
[1:10:01] bishop he desires a good work
[1:10:07] is that scripture
[1:10:10] does it mean that a person can have the
[1:10:12] desire to be a bishop
[1:10:16] okay
[1:10:17] now the bishop has to have
[1:10:19] qualifications
[1:10:21] the bible tells us
[1:10:23] not given to wine no striker not greedy
[1:10:26] or filthy look but patient not a brawler
[1:10:28] not covetous one that rules well his own
[1:10:31] house having his children in subjection
[1:10:33] with all gravity
[1:10:36] and verse two the bishop must be
[1:10:38] blameless husband of one wife village
[1:10:40] and sober of good behavior given to
[1:10:42] hospitality app to teach
[1:10:47] so there is nothing wrong in desiring to
[1:10:50] be a pastor in the church
[1:10:52] if the ambition comes out of a godly
[1:10:55] heart
[1:10:57] if it comes by natural ambition then
[1:10:59] there's wrong
[1:11:02] you know and
[1:11:04] many times it's those that don't want to
[1:11:07] that they're the ones
[1:11:09] and i talked to a good friend in africa
[1:11:11] he said we had the church and
[1:11:14] there was a brother where
[1:11:16] where i thought that he should be the
[1:11:18] one
[1:11:19] to be the pastor
[1:11:21] but he said there was another brother
[1:11:23] who said the lord spoke to me and
[1:11:26] finally the church voted for this man
[1:11:28] but he said two years down the line it
[1:11:30] was all destroyed
[1:11:33] and so
[1:11:34] it's not by human ambition
[1:11:37] it's not by putting us force
[1:11:39] that we say the lord spoke and the lord
[1:11:41] this i'm always careful
[1:11:44] because
[1:11:46] i know that a prophet would hear god's
[1:11:47] voice
[1:11:49] and i know that other people have
[1:11:52] i haven't heard an oral voice
[1:11:55] the way that god speaks to me is that he
[1:11:56] puts a thought in my mind
[1:11:59] and that i then know i need to follow
[1:12:01] that
[1:12:03] or
[1:12:04] if i took a decision
[1:12:06] which i shouldn't have taken that i
[1:12:08] can't sleep at night
[1:12:10] i know if you know what i'm talking
[1:12:12] about you know you take a decision in
[1:12:13] life you want to do something
[1:12:16] and then you go to bed and you can't
[1:12:17] sleep you can't find rest
[1:12:19] and then you know it's god talking to
[1:12:21] you he don't want you to do that you
[1:12:23] need to step back
[1:12:25] he just want to protect you from things
[1:12:27] you know but
[1:12:31] the church
[1:12:32] has the authority
[1:12:34] and
[1:12:38] if a man is a pastor
[1:12:41] there has to be
[1:12:43] also
[1:12:44] what i call an assessment
[1:12:47] if the pastorship has been beneficial to
[1:12:50] the church or not
[1:12:54] and it's not popularity
[1:12:58] now
[1:12:59] the greatest compliment the person in my
[1:13:01] church can give me is when they say
[1:13:04] brother bernard
[1:13:06] we really have feel that we have been
[1:13:08] fed the word of god
[1:13:10] over the last two or three years
[1:13:13] we really feel that we've grown in faith
[1:13:15] in stature in the spirit
[1:13:19] and
[1:13:21] one thing is for sure
[1:13:23] brother brahm said if you have the vote
[1:13:27] and
[1:13:28] the majority decides who the pastor is
[1:13:30] and then the minority don't leave
[1:13:34] right that's what he said
[1:13:37] but still
[1:13:38] once you take the vote there will be
[1:13:40] people that leave
[1:13:42] and everybody has the right to
[1:13:45] but after that happened
[1:13:48] i believe that the lord will add new
[1:13:50] people
[1:13:52] and just remember
[1:13:55] the person
[1:13:57] that you vote as pastor
[1:14:01] will never be a perfect person
[1:14:05] the person that you vote as pastor will
[1:14:07] not stand here by his own abilities
[1:14:11] but you have to believe and i know it's
[1:14:13] a truth
[1:14:15] that whomever you select god will speak
[1:14:18] to him
[1:14:19] so that he can speak to you
[1:14:22] now saying that i don't say anybody
[1:14:25] could come and be a pastor no that's not
[1:14:27] true but we have to believe that the man
[1:14:30] that god's put up here
[1:14:31] that god will be able to speak to him
[1:14:35] and
[1:14:36] and
[1:14:36] direct his thoughts
[1:14:38] that he could be able to speak to the
[1:14:41] congregation
[1:14:44] now i know it's prime material this
[1:14:45] morning
[1:14:46] but sometimes we need dry material
[1:14:49] and i had happened to me many times you
[1:14:51] know i preached a sermon and i feel good
[1:14:55] i thought man that was a wonderful
[1:14:56] sermon
[1:14:59] i came home i asked my daughter
[1:15:01] said becky how do you like it
[1:15:03] ah she said dad
[1:15:06] you know
[1:15:08] you felt enthused
[1:15:09] but
[1:15:10] i didn't really get something
[1:15:15] but then there's other times
[1:15:18] where i walk away from the platform
[1:15:20] and i say to myself
[1:15:23] i've been the worst failure this morning
[1:15:24] that i ever been i should never get back
[1:15:26] there
[1:15:28] and then i leave the church and somebody
[1:15:29] comes shakes my hand and he says brother
[1:15:31] bernard
[1:15:32] i had a question on my heart
[1:15:35] and the lord just answered it this
[1:15:36] morning
[1:15:38] and i can tell you when we feel
[1:15:40] incapable
[1:15:42] then he can do something
[1:15:45] the moment that we feel capable he can't
[1:15:47] work through us
[1:15:49] the moment they think we know
[1:15:51] well we'll become useless
[1:15:54] but the moment we feel that we are
[1:15:56] nothing
[1:15:57] then we can be something
[1:16:01] and that's why we have to do everything
[1:16:04] after the pattern that god gave us
[1:16:07] i don't come here as anyone who want to
[1:16:10] take your decision i want this church to
[1:16:12] see that it prospers
[1:16:14] i want you i want to see this place be
[1:16:17] filled with the holy spirit
[1:16:19] i want to see this place that lord can
[1:16:21] come down and minister to all of you
[1:16:24] i want this place to grow in strength in
[1:16:26] the spirit of god in faith and in the
[1:16:28] moving of the lord
[1:16:31] and you know just be fed by the word
[1:16:35] and i know brother green
[1:16:37] had been a very had a very balanced way
[1:16:39] of preaching
[1:16:41] and
[1:16:44] i love that
[1:16:45] i tried to keep my balance in the
[1:16:47] scripture
[1:16:49] and i think there's also one thing that
[1:16:51] we have to learn
[1:16:53] being in this message that preaching is
[1:16:55] more than reading quotes
[1:16:58] preaching is being able to take the word
[1:17:01] of god
[1:17:02] read it then be inspired and relate it
[1:17:06] to the people so that they can
[1:17:07] understand what that word is all about
[1:17:12] and i have nothing against reading
[1:17:13] quotes but if preaching is just reading
[1:17:15] quotes
[1:17:16] and that is not preaching
[1:17:19] and we have a we have a couple that been
[1:17:22] in another church for many years
[1:17:24] and the good point was they had a 60
[1:17:26] miles go that way
[1:17:28] and 60 miles to come to our church so
[1:17:31] that that didn't change much
[1:17:33] but
[1:17:34] they they came and
[1:17:37] they started going to different churches
[1:17:39] and then they came to me and they said
[1:17:41] brother bernard
[1:17:43] we decided we want to come to this
[1:17:45] church and i said well why is it
[1:17:48] they said where we've been
[1:17:50] we've been just been fed quotes it was
[1:17:52] one quote after the other
[1:17:55] but we felt we were not fed but we feel
[1:17:58] we've come to the place where we can
[1:18:00] hear the word of god
[1:18:03] brother brown preached from the bible
[1:18:06] that was his quote book
[1:18:09] you know he when in 65 he could have
[1:18:11] gone back to what he said in 55 and said
[1:18:13] okay got a quote from here
[1:18:15] he never did that
[1:18:18] but still i encouraged to hear the tapes
[1:18:20] or read the messages
[1:18:22] but preaching is taking the word of god
[1:18:25] under the inspiration of the holy spirit
[1:18:27] and handing it out to the people that's
[1:18:30] preaching preaching is not reading
[1:18:33] the whole text what's already been said
[1:18:37] and that's what a minister needs to do
[1:18:40] that's what the bible says he must be
[1:18:41] apt to teach
[1:18:43] he must know the word
[1:18:45] he must know what it says
[1:18:48] and a lot of times and
[1:18:49] i don't want to be critical but a lot of
[1:18:51] times i meet people
[1:18:53] they can tell you every quote
[1:18:56] but if you ask them for a scripture to
[1:18:58] back up the quote
[1:19:01] they're lost
[1:19:04] that's why we should good preacher
[1:19:06] should know his bible that's what we
[1:19:08] believe we fashion after the pattern
[1:19:12] and
[1:19:14] saying that about preaching about
[1:19:15] ministers
[1:19:17] there's one thing that i've always said
[1:19:19] a preacher has to respect the
[1:19:21] congregation
[1:19:23] and the congregation has to respect the
[1:19:25] preacher
[1:19:30] and
[1:19:31] i say it that way
[1:19:33] if the minister speaks an hour and the
[1:19:35] people fall asleep that's no respect
[1:19:40] but if he speaks two hours and the
[1:19:41] people fall asleep it's a preacher's
[1:19:43] fault
[1:19:48] it goes both ways
[1:19:50] you know brother bram said we should
[1:19:52] preach like 30 45 minutes
[1:19:54] and he said i speak longer because i
[1:19:56] have to bring these things on tape that
[1:19:58] is stored in food for you do you season
[1:20:02] but many times a lot of people they they
[1:20:05] want to take two hours or more
[1:20:07] and i'll be honest i've been always a
[1:20:10] critical person for anyone to speak more
[1:20:12] than an hour
[1:20:15] but sometimes i come home after sunday
[1:20:17] morning and they said dad
[1:20:23] it's been hour 15.
[1:20:28] and then i tell the people i said okay
[1:20:30] i'm going to let you out a little
[1:20:31] earlier next week
[1:20:34] but that's another thing
[1:20:36] church stand behind the man that you
[1:20:38] vote for
[1:20:40] pray for your pastor
[1:20:42] respect him
[1:20:44] and
[1:20:45] have a pull in your heart that whoever
[1:20:47] you vote for
[1:20:49] that god will speak to you
[1:20:52] because if you follow the right pattern
[1:20:54] then god can bless you
[1:20:56] i don't say he didn't bless you the time
[1:20:58] you had no pastor i'm not saying that i
[1:20:59] understand that there is a time where
[1:21:01] you have to see
[1:21:03] who is the one
[1:21:05] but i think the time has come for you to
[1:21:07] decide
[1:21:08] you can't go on like this for x number
[1:21:10] of years
[1:21:11] because
[1:21:12] that is not the way that god has said it
[1:21:17] i hope hope it was okay what i said
[1:21:21] but that's the word of god
[1:21:23] we just have to do it the right way you
[1:21:25] know and
[1:21:26] people there
[1:21:27] you know they
[1:21:28] sometimes leave my church they go to
[1:21:30] another church
[1:21:32] i have no problem with that i learned
[1:21:33] from brother green
[1:21:36] and he told me whenever a man says i
[1:21:38] want to start my own church
[1:21:40] he said i asked him you have a building
[1:21:42] can i help you you got some pews
[1:21:45] he said maybe you need some instruments
[1:21:47] can i help you there
[1:21:48] brother green said the last i said was
[1:21:51] you also got people that are going to go
[1:21:52] with you
[1:21:53] he said if don't i just say okay these i
[1:21:55] want to select myself the ones
[1:22:01] you know
[1:22:02] we got to keep the right attitude
[1:22:05] now god has all called us to walk the
[1:22:08] same way
[1:22:09] because there's just one way
[1:22:11] and that is that jesus said i'm the way
[1:22:13] the truth is alive in the door no man
[1:22:15] comes to the father except by me
[1:22:17] so there's just one way into heaven and
[1:22:19] that is by jesus christ
[1:22:22] so i believe that no matter which local
[1:22:24] church we're in we're all going the same
[1:22:27] way
[1:22:28] and we're all going to the same place
[1:22:32] but not in the same local church
[1:22:35] so we got to love every church that's
[1:22:37] around us
[1:22:39] so when the people leave and they have
[1:22:41] the courtesy to tell me beforehand
[1:22:44] well we pray for them as a church
[1:22:46] we bless them
[1:22:48] we pray that the lord would let them be
[1:22:49] a blessing whatever church they go to
[1:22:51] now
[1:22:53] but
[1:22:53] still i come to one one thing
[1:22:56] now in our city we have i think four
[1:22:58] message churches
[1:23:01] but i actually clearly say now ours is
[1:23:04] the best
[1:23:09] well very logic if i would not believe
[1:23:11] that our church would be the best
[1:23:13] message church in town i would be in one
[1:23:14] of the others
[1:23:16] right
[1:23:19] so that's what your position should be
[1:23:20] you should believe when you're here this
[1:23:22] is the best church in town
[1:23:27] it is that's what it is you know
[1:23:29] and then i say but i want to give you a
[1:23:31] reason
[1:23:33] the first
[1:23:34] we still keep the good old-fashioned
[1:23:38] music that we was played years ago
[1:23:43] we don't go down the line of modern
[1:23:45] so-called contemporary
[1:23:47] christian music
[1:23:50] which is just another word for trash if
[1:23:52] you excuse the expression
[1:23:55] but i can also tell you when i
[1:23:57] would go into another message church and
[1:23:59] i hear those hillsong songs i say wait a
[1:24:02] minute
[1:24:03] where are we what is the spirit that's
[1:24:05] being portrayed here
[1:24:08] and that's why i want to keep that good
[1:24:10] old music in the church the godly that
[1:24:13] saintly music that brings down the holy
[1:24:15] spirit
[1:24:16] and not a kind of fake worship
[1:24:21] i think somebody just said it to me he
[1:24:22] said they're worshiping the worship
[1:24:24] they're not worshipping god
[1:24:27] that's the first thing
[1:24:29] where i think a good church should have
[1:24:32] good songs to sing that bring down the
[1:24:34] presence of god and that are becoming
[1:24:38] because look at the people that make
[1:24:40] these hill songs and the modern music
[1:24:43] you see there the way that they dress
[1:24:45] the way that they behave and you know
[1:24:47] that they're anointed by wrong spirit
[1:24:50] and then you want to go there to get the
[1:24:52] music
[1:24:53] i think it's completely wrong
[1:24:56] and that's why i say we're the best
[1:24:58] church
[1:24:59] we sing the old songs
[1:25:02] and then we have a word-based teaching
[1:25:05] of the word of god
[1:25:07] we preach the word
[1:25:09] we don't preach fables we don't preach
[1:25:11] ideas about the message but by the grace
[1:25:13] of god we can take the word of god and
[1:25:15] say the word of god says it it does say
[1:25:17] it's the lord and we walk with that
[1:25:20] because i still believe that when the
[1:25:22] word says jesus christ the same
[1:25:24] yesterday today and forever
[1:25:26] so it's still a word-based preaching
[1:25:29] we don't preach about this or that but
[1:25:31] we preach christ and him crucified
[1:25:33] that's what paul said other people they
[1:25:35] can preach this or that but i preach
[1:25:37] christ and him crucified
[1:25:39] and that's the subject of the message is
[1:25:41] jesus christ
[1:25:43] so that is why we don't need anybody to
[1:25:45] bring big revelations or high
[1:25:47] revelations or understandings we need
[1:25:49] someone in the pulpit that can preach
[1:25:51] jesus christ and him alive today in our
[1:25:53] lives
[1:25:55] that is what we need that is what i call
[1:25:57] good preaching
[1:26:05] you go to other places
[1:26:08] and then they they will tell you of all
[1:26:10] the benefits
[1:26:12] and then they say but only through this
[1:26:14] message
[1:26:16] as if people never got saved before
[1:26:18] brother brown came
[1:26:26] and i said to brother aaron this morning
[1:26:28] and i said yesterday talking to wilson
[1:26:32] the glory is to god alone
[1:26:36] god does not share his glory with any
[1:26:39] man
[1:26:40] so we do not give brother branham the
[1:26:42] glory
[1:26:44] the glory we give to god
[1:26:46] but to brother branham we give our
[1:26:48] respect for the office that he had been
[1:26:50] carrying it's two completely different
[1:26:53] things
[1:26:54] we worship a living christ
[1:26:56] and we know that we had a prophet on our
[1:26:58] generation but the prophet pointed us
[1:27:02] to that christ
[1:27:04] so that's the second element of a good
[1:27:06] church
[1:27:08] and the third element is prayer
[1:27:13] if you preach a good sermon
[1:27:17] and you say a little prayer
[1:27:20] and you sing a few songs and you leave
[1:27:22] the building
[1:27:24] you're missing something
[1:27:28] you're missing something
[1:27:31] where is the place
[1:27:33] where the spirit of god can move among
[1:27:36] the congregation
[1:27:40] it's in the prayer time
[1:27:42] after the word has gone forth
[1:27:47] and that's where we need to take time
[1:27:51] and i know it's not very common in
[1:27:52] message churches they don't let the
[1:27:54] congregation pray
[1:27:56] but the way i was raised
[1:27:59] we always had the occasion that after
[1:28:02] the word went forth
[1:28:04] brothers and sisters in the congregation
[1:28:06] could pray aloud
[1:28:09] and of course we're instructed how
[1:28:11] prayer needs to be
[1:28:13] we're not there to
[1:28:15] tell a life story
[1:28:17] it's not that one person takes 15
[1:28:19] minutes and
[1:28:20] all the attention
[1:28:22] while we say a short prayer to god
[1:28:25] we start to praise him
[1:28:27] we start to worship him
[1:28:29] one person start to pray here
[1:28:31] and the spirit of god fall there that
[1:28:33] person starts to worship
[1:28:35] and the spirit of god fall there
[1:28:38] that's what we need in the church
[1:28:41] and if we don't give room to prayer in
[1:28:44] the church we're missing something
[1:28:47] we're losing the benefits
[1:28:49] because
[1:28:51] there is a time
[1:28:54] that
[1:28:55] god wants to speak to your heart
[1:28:58] you've heard the word
[1:29:00] now he wants to make the word life in
[1:29:02] your life
[1:29:03] and that's why i always say i want the
[1:29:06] prayer time in the church
[1:29:08] that that we have time that we give
[1:29:10] opportunity
[1:29:13] i know when people come in they come to
[1:29:14] the service maybe
[1:29:16] they never been in the message they just
[1:29:18] come to church two or three times
[1:29:21] but in the prayer time they all of a
[1:29:22] sudden open their mouth and start to
[1:29:24] pray
[1:29:26] and you can realize
[1:29:28] they haven't been around us they're just
[1:29:30] there for two or three weeks but you can
[1:29:32] see that god's been speaking to their
[1:29:34] heart
[1:29:37] that's also a good reputation for a
[1:29:39] church
[1:29:41] and i've seen that in
[1:29:44] yeah in the past couple of months we
[1:29:47] have some friends
[1:29:48] we've known them for almost 20 years and
[1:29:51] the lady has helped us to do the
[1:29:53] translation of the supernatural book
[1:29:55] when we started
[1:29:57] we've always been friends with them but
[1:29:59] they never came to church with us
[1:30:02] and then all of a
[1:30:04] sudden he gets very sick and
[1:30:07] he got a skin cancer and
[1:30:10] they come and talk to us and they said
[1:30:11] we've pushed aside
[1:30:13] all of our worldly engagements
[1:30:16] we left the clubs in the societies that
[1:30:18] we've been in
[1:30:20] you want to come to church
[1:30:23] and he himself
[1:30:24] used to be in a baptist church as a
[1:30:26] young man and
[1:30:27] after the second or third service he
[1:30:29] just come and hugged me
[1:30:31] he said bernard i'm so glad i found the
[1:30:33] way back where i was
[1:30:36] and you know they just come for two or
[1:30:38] three services and you look at them
[1:30:40] and they feel
[1:30:42] like they're right at home
[1:30:45] and this is what a church has to be
[1:30:48] when people come in here they have to
[1:30:50] feel that lovely atmosphere they have to
[1:30:53] feel that we're right at home
[1:30:57] and god just gave us a pattern that we
[1:30:58] need to follow
[1:31:00] the love of god among us
[1:31:03] and just that we don't play church but
[1:31:05] that we are church
[1:31:08] we don't play it we are the church
[1:31:10] we are the ones that the holy spirit
[1:31:12] works through
[1:31:14] we're the ones that bring our light into
[1:31:15] the building
[1:31:17] we're the ones that should encourage one
[1:31:19] another
[1:31:21] we're not there to build clicks
[1:31:23] is that a word that you use clicks is
[1:31:25] that the same you know little groups of
[1:31:26] people
[1:31:29] it's always good when the church is not
[1:31:30] too large
[1:31:32] because then it's easier not to form
[1:31:34] groups
[1:31:35] but i can say that about the church that
[1:31:37] we have at home i'm just so glad that in
[1:31:39] our church there's no clicks
[1:31:41] there's not one group here one group
[1:31:43] there but everybody can be together and
[1:31:45] fellowship together
[1:31:47] and this what we need the unity and the
[1:31:49] spirit
[1:31:50] the unity in the doctrine the unity in
[1:31:52] the place that we're going to that we
[1:31:54] know that we are united in christ that
[1:31:56] we're going to a place
[1:31:59] and i hope you don't hold against what i
[1:32:01] said this morning but that's my
[1:32:03] recommendation
[1:32:05] please decide on who you want to be your
[1:32:08] pastor
[1:32:09] please have a vote
[1:32:11] maybe not tomorrow but one of these days
[1:32:15] and please
[1:32:17] let nobody decide a list of candidates
[1:32:20] for you
[1:32:22] see that's also one way where politics
[1:32:25] come in
[1:32:27] and
[1:32:30] everybody has their place in the church
[1:32:34] and
[1:32:35] the deacons have their place the elders
[1:32:37] have their place the archers have the
[1:32:38] place the pastor has their place
[1:32:41] but
[1:32:43] let me say like this
[1:32:45] a church
[1:32:47] which is run by deacons does never work
[1:32:52] and
[1:32:52] let me share that one last point
[1:32:55] i
[1:32:57] i know of someone
[1:32:59] you always wanted to be a pastor if you
[1:33:01] finally found a church to pastor but
[1:33:03] it's run by the deacons
[1:33:06] and the way that it works is that they
[1:33:08] say well
[1:33:09] you know you're retired you're getting
[1:33:11] the pension
[1:33:12] so we're not going to pay you as a
[1:33:14] church
[1:33:15] but you know you've been a good pastor
[1:33:17] we're going to raise your your the
[1:33:18] amount we give you for each sermon from
[1:33:20] 50 to 75
[1:33:24] that's wrong
[1:33:26] that is completely wrong
[1:33:30] once you vote for a pastor the pastor
[1:33:32] will become the head of this church
[1:33:36] and yet what you have to understand
[1:33:38] that's what brother brahm says
[1:33:41] i can read you the quotes but you know
[1:33:42] them all i'm not saying things that are
[1:33:45] news to you right
[1:33:47] or what i'm saying is news
[1:33:51] that's the truth
[1:33:53] once you vote for the pastor the pastor
[1:33:55] will become the head of the church
[1:33:57] and he will be in charge
[1:33:59] that's what brother brahm said that's
[1:34:01] the way it's organized
[1:34:04] but
[1:34:05] that's the way it should be that's the
[1:34:06] way god made it
[1:34:09] and you pray for the man whomever you
[1:34:11] decide
[1:34:13] and the lord bless you let's pray
[1:34:18] heavenly father lord jesus
[1:34:21] we come to you this morning
[1:34:23] and we want to thank you lord for this
[1:34:25] opportunity
[1:34:27] to say the things that needed to be said
[1:34:29] lord god
[1:34:32] lord i want to ask you that you would
[1:34:34] put your wisdom on the people of this
[1:34:36] church lord god
[1:34:38] and you would give them the right
[1:34:40] inspiration and the right decision of
[1:34:42] heart lord jesus
[1:34:44] lord that people would not vote just by
[1:34:47] their intellectual thoughts
[1:34:49] but the people would get down on their
[1:34:51] knees and say lord who do you want to be
[1:34:54] the pastor of this church
[1:34:56] and then let god speak to their hearts
[1:34:58] and that they know to make the right
[1:35:00] decision
[1:35:01] brother ram said that the decision is
[1:35:03] the holy ghost and the majority we'll
[1:35:05] take that for the holy ghost but it
[1:35:08] takes prayer by every person lord
[1:35:10] will you just help them is my prayer
[1:35:12] lord jesus and lord you know i have a
[1:35:15] neutral position in this place lord god
[1:35:18] i do not favor anyone but i want to this
[1:35:20] man to be the pastor that you decide to
[1:35:23] be the pastor lord
[1:35:24] and then i ask you a blessing on this
[1:35:26] church this morning lord
[1:35:28] ask the blessings for the people that
[1:35:30] have stood faithful in his tabernacle
[1:35:32] lord
[1:35:33] some of them walked away but there's a
[1:35:35] group of people that stayed faithful to
[1:35:37] this place lord god
[1:35:38] would you just reward them for their
[1:35:40] standing lord would you pour their
[1:35:42] blessings upon them by your grace
[1:35:45] and we give you the honor and praise in
[1:35:47] jesus name
[1:35:48] amen
[1:35:50] god bless you
[1:35:52] and the service back brother aaron
[1:35:55] god bless you see you this afternoon
[1:35:58] god bless you
[1:36:01] [Applause]
[1:36:08] you should be happy or you're not the
[1:36:10] one that has to stand up here now
[1:36:14] but god has spoken
[1:36:17] he's never left us
[1:36:18] he never will leave us and it's
[1:36:21] and brother dan i always have a song and
[1:36:24] i was standing back there and i said i
[1:36:25] don't have a song

[1:40:37] lord it's been
[1:40:39] six and a half years now
[1:40:41] since you took brother perry home
[1:40:45] because it was that time
[1:40:47] [Music]
[1:40:49] maybe
[1:40:51] some of us would have wished that he
[1:40:52] could have become young and strong again
[1:40:56] and continue to lead the church on
[1:40:58] but you had
[1:41:00] a different way for us to go
[1:41:03] [Music]
[1:41:05] and
[1:41:07] brother bernard had mentioned to me
[1:41:10] what he had felt the lord gave him to
[1:41:12] speak this morning
[1:41:15] and it was nothing we had talked about
[1:41:17] previously or i encouraged him lord but
[1:41:20] you had saw this day
[1:41:22] and you would choose for him to come
[1:41:25] and speak
[1:41:27] to us lord
[1:41:29] because you're mindful of us
[1:41:31] and we are your sheep lord
[1:41:34] now help us as a congregation
[1:41:37] those that call this church home
[1:41:41] they attend here faithfully they pray
[1:41:43] with us they
[1:41:45] they desire lord for us to grow
[1:41:48] as a body
[1:41:50] as part of the flock of god
[1:41:52] lord lead us guide us
[1:41:55] and may we be willing to say lord i will
[1:41:57] follow
[1:41:59] i will go with you
[1:42:00] i will let you lead i will let you
[1:42:02] direct
[1:42:04] and the decision that is made lord being
[1:42:06] made through the holy spirit lord
[1:42:09] would be the best thing for this church
[1:42:11] here lord
[1:42:13] it's our desire lord i i would say it's
[1:42:15] my desire but it's all our desire
[1:42:18] to grow in the grace of god
[1:42:21] not necessarily in the amount of people
[1:42:23] to say we need this amount or that
[1:42:26] but people here filled with the holy
[1:42:27] ghost
[1:42:28] people loving the lord jesus and such a
[1:42:31] presence and an atmosphere in the light
[1:42:33] here that others would say let's go see
[1:42:36] what's happening there
[1:42:38] let it be lord jesus is our prayer in
[1:42:42] jesus christ's name amen

[1:42:57] times i sat there and said oh

[1:43:01] that this church not because we want it
[1:43:03] filled to say we're the biggest church
[1:43:05] in town
[1:43:06] but filled with people that love the
[1:43:08] lord jesus
[1:43:09] and the lord jesus is here with us

[1:45:16] and and one of the things that brother
[1:45:18] bernard talked about prayer
[1:45:20] prayer
[1:45:22] prayer is just not a bunch of words
[1:45:23] spoken
[1:45:25] you can read a prayer you can quote a
[1:45:27] prayer
[1:45:28] but prayer is your heart communicating
[1:45:30] to god and god speaking back to you
[1:45:34] if you could only get three words out
[1:45:38] and it got to god
[1:45:40] and he came back that'd be the best
[1:45:42] prayer you ever had
[1:45:46] you know that to be the truth
[1:45:49] that's the way when he responds back to
[1:45:51] your prayer and begins to minister to
[1:45:53] you so believe that as you go
[1:45:55] we'll give
[1:45:58] the glory
[1:46:01] to me
[1:46:05] and
[1:46:07] [Music]
