[21:15] you know i
[21:16] i was at a homeowner appointment just
[21:19] the other day and
[21:22] there's a first for everything i
[21:25] they asked me to leave the house that
[21:26] was the first time somebody told me to
[21:28] leave and then escorted me out
[21:31] and they got this notion in their head
[21:34] about me
[21:36] um because of the situation was not an
[21:38] issue with our cabinets it was an issue
[21:40] of something else
[21:42] any any question my
[21:45] my experience and i said well if you if
[21:47] you want to talk with
[21:49] the employees of the company here the
[21:51] builder
[21:52] they could tell you
[21:54] you know that i i do my work
[21:57] and he goes oh you're going to throw
[21:58] names at me are you
[22:00] i said no he goes i know names too
[22:04] but of all the names to know
[22:07] i do know one
[22:08] that in his name all demons are cast out
[22:11] all evil presence is removed all
[22:14] sicknesses are gone
[22:16] as i walked out the door i said lord i

[22:19] you were cast out of places people
[22:21] didn't want you
[22:22] there's nothing to be heard about
[22:25] yeah it's humiliating you get
[22:27] embarrassed
[22:28] but i'm glad that he took took our place
[22:30] amen
[22:32] brother ed
[22:35] turned into a prayer request here for
[22:38] that his son nathanael brother nate
[22:41] says please pray for two persons who
[22:43] were
[22:44] just diagnosed with cancer
[22:46] they're asking for a touch from the lord
[22:49] and for a father who his son is going
[22:52] down the wrong road with a gang and
[22:54] asking the god down would reach down
[22:57] and turn his son around so
[23:00] you know there was a prodigal son that
[23:01] went out on his way
[23:04] but the father desired him back
[23:07] and with that draw on that pull and i'm
[23:09] glad god has looked at us that way we've
[23:11] gone down a wrong road a time or two
[23:14] but the father's love reaches out to us
[23:20] sisters sister zumbrunnen says
[23:22] please pray for my little sister annette
[23:25] she's in the hospital
[23:27] for so swelling leg that is bleeding
[23:30] she has congestive
[23:32] heart failure and she won't stop smoking
[23:35] so
[23:36] you know
[23:38] greater is he
[23:39] than everything that
[23:41] you know we we we try hard we do our
[23:43] best we we try to lord today i'm i'm
[23:46] gonna do
[23:48] but he let him get in there and he
[23:50] causes that to happen listening to
[23:52] brother
[23:53] lonnie
[23:55] jenkins testimony when he was trying
[23:57] hard to stop smoking
[23:59] but when he turned over to god he said
[24:00] from that day on
[24:02] never again so our god is more than able
[24:05] to do that
[24:07] brother robert circonus
[24:08] i have a doctor's appointment
[24:10] uh for to have the eyes checked and
[24:13] praying that all would go well so
[24:15] that's what god's word says so that's
[24:17] what we'll believe together so
[24:20] my sister kathy they prayed for her a
[24:22] few days back but she called this
[24:24] morning
[24:26] and she got a hold of my father and i
[24:28] know he prayed for her but she's having
[24:29] a difficult time breathing this morning
[24:31] and i called her back and you could hear
[24:34] she was having a hard time breathing and
[24:36] she was asking for prayer
[24:39] brother and sister brother lyle sister
[24:41] heather johnson both not feeling well
[24:43] this morning
[24:44] my daughter elizabeth was not feeling
[24:46] well and brother peter mcfadden so
[24:49] the sunday school teachers are not here
[24:51] so there was no sunday school and
[24:52] brother peter was not feeling well along
[24:54] with jonas
[24:55] and then brother matthew mcfadden is on
[24:57] a trip him and his sister are in germany
[25:00] for a couple of weeks a little trip
[25:02] taken together so let's remember them
[25:05] if you'll stand with me
[25:08] how many have a need brother ahead if
[25:10] you
[25:11] make your way and brother had had
[25:13] something he wanted to share a testimony
[25:14] also so
[25:16] if we can take god and take him at his
[25:18] word
[25:20] lord your word says my feelings say this
[25:22] but your word says that my body fills
[25:24] this but your word says that and you
[25:27] stand on it and it pleases the lord
[25:30] or faith gets god and it catches him
[25:33] right on his tracks so
[25:34] amen
[25:36] so brother ed here

[41:09] uh amen we feel a connection i know that
[41:12] uh
[41:13] brother ray
[41:14] has a burden for the people here uh just
[41:16] a
[41:17] just a familial bond amen and and uh
[41:20] we're praying for you amen we're
[41:23] standing with you in love and in unity
[41:25] amen we appreciate the the history of
[41:28] this church and its stand
[41:30] for this message amen which is a living
[41:32] word amen even today amen certainly want
[41:36] to open up with paying respects to
[41:38] brother greene
[41:39] amen all that he's been to the bride of
[41:41] jesus christ but if we'll go right to
[41:43] the word with that said if you'll turn
[41:45] with me to proverbs the 18th chapter
[41:48] amen but we do greet you
[41:50] amen and say god bless you in the name
[41:52] of jesus
[41:54] proverbs chapter 18 and we're going to
[41:57] turn to the 10th verse
[41:59] and uh just ask that you'll bear with me
[42:01] this morning i just uh i've got a little
[42:03] thought here
[42:05] and uh
[42:07] wrestling a little bit
[42:08] trying to find which way to go so we're
[42:10] just trusting in the leadership of the
[42:11] lord but but this morning i just want to
[42:13] do a little simple preaching on this
[42:15] thought
[42:16] just to lay a foundation for something
[42:19] that i have for this evening heavy on my
[42:21] heart here but we're going to title this
[42:23] sermon we're going to read two
[42:24] scriptures here one brother branham use
[42:26] brother brahm use both these scriptures
[42:29] when he preached letting off the
[42:30] pressure amen which i think is a timely
[42:32] message for the day that we're living in
[42:35] amen is we have a need to let off the
[42:36] pressure and so my title this morning
[42:39] god willing is are you alive in there
[42:43] are you alive in there amen proverbs
[42:45] chapter 18 and verse 10
[42:47] the name of the lord is a strong tower
[42:51] the righteous runneth into it
[42:54] and is safe amen the righteous runneth
[42:57] into it and is safe and we'll also turn
[43:00] over to isaiah the 32nd chapter
[43:03] and take the two first two verses there
[43:05] from letting off the pressure
[43:07] and in uh studying for this um i've
[43:10] spent quite a bit of time in in uh the
[43:12] the sermons brother branham preached on
[43:14] letting off the pressure as well as i
[43:17] believe there's three of them where
[43:18] brother branham preached on a hidden
[43:19] life in christ a hidden life in christ
[43:22] amen and i believe that's where we can
[43:24] escape
[43:25] the pressures of this world amen is to
[43:27] be hidden in him isaiah 32 1
[43:30] behold a king shall reign in
[43:32] righteousness
[43:33] and princes shall rule in judgment
[43:36] and a man shall be as a hiding place
[43:39] from the wind
[43:40] and a covert from the tempest
[43:43] that word means a shelter
[43:45] as rivers of water in a dry place
[43:48] as the shadow of a great rock in a weary
[43:50] land amen could we have a word of prayer
[43:53] heavenly father i just want to thank you
[43:55] lord for another opportunity lord to
[43:57] come before this living word this
[43:59] message father to us lord it's no dead
[44:01] letter but father it's the word of life
[44:04] into this age god how that you have sent
[44:07] your word for father and not only that
[44:09] but there's a promise that accompanies
[44:11] lord the prophecy of this message lord
[44:14] that you would not let your word return
[44:15] unto you void father but that there
[44:17] would be a seed that would be sown into
[44:19] this laodicean age father and it would
[44:21] take root in the hearts lord of an
[44:24] elected people father and so we're
[44:26] standing here father not on the basis of
[44:28] our own efforts or our merits father or
[44:31] anything that we would be able to
[44:32] achieve but we're standing here father
[44:34] as an achievement of your living word
[44:35] father of the holy ghost bringing it to
[44:38] life father in a people lord a light to
[44:41] this dark generation father we pray that
[44:43] once more your holy spirit would come
[44:45] and anoint this word may it have an
[44:47] effect in our lives father may it may it
[44:49] not fall short lord but may it
[44:51] accomplish lord which you sent it to
[44:53] accomplish father and i'm your empty
[44:55] vessel lord with nothing to offer asking
[44:57] lord that you lead and guide father may
[44:59] nothing be said outside of your perfect
[45:01] will but may you just take complete
[45:02] control lord and anoint the speaker and
[45:06] the hearer alike father to receive the
[45:07] word of god this morning
[45:09] come and meet us lord and fellowship
[45:11] with us along the way in the name of
[45:13] jesus christ amen god bless you you're
[45:15] seated this morning
[45:17] and again we're just laying a little
[45:18] foundation with just just some simple
[45:20] preaching on this thought amen of
[45:22] letting off the pressure and
[45:24] i think if we were to ask for a show of
[45:26] hands uh who amongst us
[45:29] uh has is is feeling the pressure of
[45:32] this day i think that all of us would be
[45:34] able to witness amen we would have to
[45:36] admit that in this particular time in
[45:38] this particular season there's a
[45:40] pressure that's on the people it's on
[45:42] the hearts of the people brother branham
[45:44] said in that message letting off the
[45:45] pressure he said there is a pressure on
[45:47] the people today and i and i thought
[45:49] it's quite wonderful how he says he says
[45:51] that pressure has no limitation or any
[45:54] denominational lines amen so it's not
[45:56] just for one church or another it's not
[45:58] on this people but not this people or
[46:00] it's on the unbelievers or only on the
[46:02] believers it's it's on everybody
[46:04] everybody's feeling the pressure amen
[46:06] co-workers are feeling the pressure our
[46:09] associates in this world are feeling the
[46:11] pressure of this day amen you you just
[46:13] fellowship with people out here and
[46:14] there's something in the human
[46:16] consciousness that we're coming to a
[46:18] time where it's getting tight it's
[46:20] getting there's gonna be a lot of
[46:21] friction there's gonna be a lot of
[46:22] pressure on the hearts of the people and
[46:24] we feel those things as christians we
[46:25] feel that pressing down amen brother
[46:28] braham said it has no age line it has no
[46:30] respect of person this pressure is on
[46:32] young and old it's on good and it's on
[46:34] bad it's on everybody a pressure amen
[46:36] amen and we're all quite familiar with
[46:38] brother brandon preaching these things
[46:39] in the 1960s but i i think it would not
[46:42] be a stretch to say amen if the people
[46:44] were under a pressure then how much more
[46:46] it is now a pressure that's on the
[46:48] people amen and we find that the reason
[46:50] that the reason that life is that way
[46:52] the reason this existence that we're
[46:54] carving out here in this layout of
[46:55] seeing time
[46:56] the reason that that we're feeling that
[46:58] pressure is because we're living in a
[47:00] world that a prophet a vindicated
[47:02] prophet has called this world satan's
[47:04] eden amen it's satan's eden amen that
[47:08] so there's an ownership there there's a
[47:10] possession there amen which is of the
[47:12] devil amen amen and what am i saying i'm
[47:15] saying that the key thing to realize
[47:17] about the pressures of this life and
[47:19] trying to eke out a a life in this world
[47:21] today and feeling that pressure people
[47:23] become discouraged they become
[47:24] disheartened because they're trying to
[47:26] find something down here that satisfies
[47:28] and they can't do it and so people
[47:30] become discouraged but what you've got
[47:32] to realize as a child of god by this
[47:34] message amen is that this world was not
[47:37] built for us amen it was not built with
[47:39] you in mind this society this world this
[47:42] eden it was not created for you it was
[47:44] created amen it was it was it was
[47:46] perverted for the purposes of the devil
[47:48] it's for the devil's glory it's for the
[47:50] devil's purpose it's for his worship
[47:52] it's for his lifestyle it's for his
[47:54] society and his culture it's not for us
[47:57] amen so all of the pressures that we're
[47:59] feeling in this world and in this in
[48:01] this rat race amen and amen in just the
[48:04] cycle of this life and we pursue
[48:07] things down here we try to build houses
[48:09] and lands and we find that there's no
[48:11] reward in it there's no satisfaction and
[48:13] people become discouraged wondering
[48:15] where there would be a refuge amen but
[48:17] but it gives us peace as christians to
[48:20] find out amen that this world is not our
[48:22] inheritance it is not our realm it's not
[48:25] our place amen but
[48:27] and that's why we don't seem to fit in
[48:29] here amen christians do not seem to fit
[48:32] into this world amen you think of all
[48:34] the pressures of the rat race you
[48:36] brothers know that you work a job you
[48:38] know and you you work and you work and
[48:40] you put in effort and someone else
[48:41] profits and and you try to build
[48:44] something and it seems like it's always
[48:45] taken away and we're always chasing
[48:47] after something always stuck in the
[48:48] cycle week in a week out amen we find no
[48:51] satisfaction there amen because we find
[48:54] that all the ways that this world
[48:56] measures success what this world calls
[48:58] success amen is not uh it is not true
[49:01] satisfaction uh wealth and fame and
[49:04] popularity amen and and and material
[49:07] possessions we know that biologically
[49:09] that those things don't satisfy
[49:11] scientifically the world knows those
[49:13] things don't satisfy but we know what it
[49:15] is as christians it's been revealed to
[49:17] us that here we have no continuing city
[49:20] no inheritance but we're abraham's seed
[49:22] amen we wander and we sojourn here and
[49:25] we try to make our life but we're
[49:26] seeking a city that's not made with
[49:28] hands it has no material wealth it has
[49:30] no amen it has no uh it has no earthly
[49:34] beauty it's of another realm it's of
[49:35] another place amen but i don't want to
[49:37] get ahead of myself amen we want to go
[49:39] that direction tonight
[49:41] amen but when we just think of the
[49:42] pressures that's on the people today
[49:45] amen look at how society has become we
[49:47] we find that people are more connected
[49:49] than they ever have because of the
[49:50] technology that we have we have we have
[49:53] social media and yet we're more
[49:55] anti-social we're more connected and yet
[49:57] more apart more divided more more
[50:00] separated amen uh it seems like the way
[50:03] that that that our our culture is
[50:05] conducted that everything is poisoned
[50:07] all affection is poison with with
[50:10] jealousy with competition with trying to
[50:12] make my life present my life as
[50:14] something that's you know that's
[50:15] something that's beyond yours and amen
[50:18] everybody's putting on a front putting
[50:19] on a face amen and yet we find that the
[50:22] hearts are empty amen amen the scripture
[50:25] said it would be the scripture said the
[50:26] love of many would wax cold amen amen we
[50:29] find that we have more entertainments we
[50:31] have more satisfaction for our uh we
[50:34] have more to occupy our minds than we've
[50:36] ever had we've we have more access to
[50:37] these things than we ever have but we
[50:39] find that all the entertainment turns
[50:40] out to be entertainment is a drug amen
[50:43] young people remember that entertainment
[50:45] is is a the entertainment of this world
[50:47] is attractive amen but but what it
[50:49] serves to do is it it's a little shot in
[50:51] the arm to get you through the day or to
[50:54] get you down to get your mind to relax
[50:56] in the evening time so that you can fall
[50:58] asleep and then in the morning go back
[51:00] to the same vicious cycle but there's no
[51:02] satisfaction in it amen amen it's
[51:05] satan's eden everything coming and going
[51:07] is working against god's people and all
[51:09] the people amen to bring it to a place
[51:12] where everyone's under pressure
[51:14] not all the traps of the enemy are to
[51:16] destroy god's people
[51:19] some of them are to make you settle for
[51:20] less to compromise to
[51:24] amen to to go without but you know
[51:26] entertainment dulls the pain of a life
[51:28] without purpose and without meaning i'm
[51:30] just laying a foundation here you bear
[51:32] with me okay
[51:33] amen
[51:34] the fashions of this life
[51:36] amen you know how it is that you got to
[51:38] dress a certain way
[51:40] amen and what the world promises you is
[51:42] that if you conform to the fashion then
[51:44] the world will accept you amen but then
[51:46] a couple years down the line the
[51:47] fashions change
[51:48] and you have to change
[51:50] amen or or or or be an outcast amen and
[51:54] amen uh to to live a life a holiness in
[51:56] this time to live a life of
[51:58] of modesty before the lord is it's not
[52:00] accepted amen but the world and the
[52:03] world promises that if we compromise and
[52:05] we begin to look like the world and try
[52:06] to keep up with the fashions of the
[52:08] world amen then we'll be accepted but
[52:10] then what happens when the fashions
[52:12] change you know it's a cycle it's a it's
[52:15] a
[52:16] you're chasing something that that that
[52:18] promises but it never delivers amen and
[52:21] it's such a
[52:22] cycle of materialism amen and
[52:24] consumerism and that that's what
[52:26] layadacia is for it's for you to consume
[52:29] and consume and consume and purchase and
[52:32] conform and dress and achieve and buy
[52:36] amen and never be satisfied satisfaction
[52:39] never comes
[52:41] amen so we find what we find in this
[52:43] world that we're living in is we find a
[52:45] people that have wealth like never
[52:46] before
[52:48] we're a society that has beauty like
[52:50] never before
[52:51] we have pleasures like never before we
[52:53] have comforts like never before
[52:55] and yet on the inside
[52:57] people are dead
[53:00] dying
[53:01] it's a dying generation dead hearts dead
[53:03] lives emptiness
[53:05] dissatisfaction
[53:07] oh my
[53:08] but all this is a contrast brother
[53:10] sister satan's eden is a contrast amen
[53:12] to a to a deeper life a higher
[53:15] experience
[53:16] in christ this world is dead all that it
[53:18] offers is death all that's in the hearts
[53:20] of the people is death and a spiritual
[53:22] death the last plague that brother brahm
[53:24] said would be poured out even in the
[53:25] churches but in christ is promised life
[53:28] amen there is a place there is an
[53:30] experience with god
[53:32] which which is is is is meant to be an
[53:34] escape from the pressures of this world
[53:36] amen the bible said we read it that he
[53:39] is a strong tower amen he's a shelter
[53:42] christ is a refuge what does that mean
[53:45] it means that when you have experienced
[53:46] christ and you come to this this uh life
[53:49] that i'm talking about then you're on
[53:51] the inside with christ and the world is
[53:53] on the outside so there's a division
[53:55] there is a defense there's a refuge
[53:57] there's something that is sheltering you
[53:59] from the cultures of this world amen oh
[54:02] we find that we're in a world where
[54:03] these cold layouts seeing winds are
[54:05] blowing like never before amen amen uh
[54:08] what are those winds it's winds of
[54:10] influence winds of lukewarm uh
[54:13] uh cultures and lukewarm ideas amen and
[54:16] everywhere that we go in this world
[54:18] we're being bombarded day by day our
[54:20] young people are being bombarded moment
[54:22] by moment amen everything that they're
[54:24] touching everything that they're doing
[54:26] everywhere that they're going they're
[54:27] hearing the voices amen of this life and
[54:30] amen voices that are trying to bring in
[54:32] influence friends and and we find that
[54:34] many people are coming under the
[54:36] influence of these voices influences
[54:38] people have been the church has been
[54:39] touched by the culture the churches the
[54:42] church has been touched by the fashions
[54:43] of this world amen many people have come
[54:45] under political voices amen under under
[54:48] doctrinal voices under the influence of
[54:50] kingdom builders or amen or or or or
[54:53] church builders amen and everyone's
[54:56] being
[54:57] everyone is being exposed to these
[54:59] voices because that's the word that
[55:00] we're living in it's layout asia it's a
[55:02] time of confusion it's a time when
[55:04] there's many conflicting ideas and all
[55:06] of that is being poured out on the
[55:07] people to bring a pressure of which way
[55:09] will i go which way amen which way will
[55:12] i conform and it brings a pressure
[55:14] friends i believe with all my heart that
[55:16] in especially in this day like never
[55:18] before
[55:19] there's only one way to survive the
[55:21] exposure amen if any of you brothers are
[55:23] outdoorsman you're in a good part of the
[55:25] country for that you know that you know
[55:27] that when it gets to nighttime out in
[55:29] the desert and those cold winds start
[55:30] coming in amen one thing that a
[55:32] survivalist has to keep in mind it's
[55:35] more pressing it's more urgent than food
[55:37] more urgent than water amen is that
[55:40] you've got to get out of the
[55:42] exposure amen it's the exposure that
[55:44] will kill you first if when those cold
[55:46] winds are blowing you've got nothing to
[55:47] hide behind you'll fall as certain as
[55:50] anything amen you will succumb to the
[55:52] coldness of the environment amen amen
[55:55] and today with these cold layout of
[55:56] seeing winds blowing amen i would
[55:58] maintain to the church of the living god
[56:00] that there's only one way to survive lay
[56:02] out a sea and exposure that's to get
[56:04] into this strong tower amen by a true
[56:07] experience with god that will shut you
[56:09] in
[56:10] to the holy of holies amen shut you in
[56:13] where the presence of god is
[56:15] hallelujah to get in this shelter amen
[56:18] amen oh we find that that because it's
[56:20] such a subtle age it's so deceitful amen
[56:23] though
[56:23] all of the world is uniting under
[56:25] different voices and different movements
[56:27] amen even the churches are trying to
[56:29] bring a unity as brother branham said
[56:31] well they would even use a scripture
[56:33] that jesus prayed that we would all be
[56:34] one he said not that kind of one
[56:37] but the kind of one that the bride will
[56:38] be is i and my father are one you're
[56:40] shutting with god you're connected to
[56:42] something that's not of this world and
[56:44] so there's a become a division there's
[56:46] become a shelter from this world amen i
[56:48] believe the church is to be separate
[56:50] from the world we're not of its culture
[56:52] we're not of its creeds we're not of its
[56:54] movements or it's ideas we belong to
[56:56] christ amen we're called out we're
[56:58] elected we're separated
[57:01] amen i and my father are one i'm in you
[57:03] and you're in me
[57:05] brother brant said what a beautiful
[57:06] picture it is today of a consecrated
[57:08] life who once he enters in with christ
[57:11] is dead to the things of the world
[57:13] hid away with god and the veils drop
[57:15] down around and all the worlds shut off
[57:19] doesn't that appeal to the christian
[57:21] heart
[57:22] and escape from this world and escape
[57:25] from its culture from its chaos from its
[57:27] influence
[57:28] a hiding place brother brown said then
[57:31] christianity and religion become a
[57:32] pleasure to every believer
[57:35] a pleasure
[57:36] to every believer but today he said
[57:38] people have just enough religion
[57:41] to make them miserable
[57:43] knowing that they ought to do this but
[57:45] they're trying to escape hell
[57:47] he said if that's the way i felt about
[57:48] it brother i don't know what i would do
[57:50] isn't that quite a statement
[57:52] just enough religion to make you
[57:54] miserable
[57:56] amen just enough religion
[57:58] to make you miserable you know we've got
[58:00] plenty of that kind of religion around
[58:02] this message
[58:04] plenty of people that know enough to
[58:06] dress the part and they can swap the
[58:08] quotes and they can recount the stories
[58:10] and they attend the churches amen and go
[58:12] to the meetings and things like this but
[58:14] brother branham made the statement are
[58:16] we really getting the people to christ
[58:18] are we just getting them to church
[58:20] amen just enough religion to make you
[58:22] miserable but friends you found that
[58:25] that there's something there are many
[58:26] people around this uh message many young
[58:29] people and even older ones that have
[58:30] been around a little while they're
[58:32] they're they're familiar with the
[58:34] message they're familiar with the
[58:35] teaching they're familiar with the
[58:36] doctrine amen they they know the stories
[58:39] they're part of the culture they're part
[58:41] of the church they've joined the
[58:42] movement amen but we find it there we
[58:44] have people that have never met christ
[58:47] amen amen even in 2021 there are people
[58:50] sitting on the pews of message churches
[58:52] that are not familiar with what i'm
[58:54] explaining and so we find that people
[58:56] are miserable amen can you imagine what
[58:59] a fate that would be amen to be right on
[59:01] the banks of the living water amen and
[59:03] die of thirst of this laodicean
[59:05] wilderness amen to be hearing the words
[59:08] of life you know what this message is to
[59:10] you what it is to me we know what it is
[59:12] amen but many people are hearing it but
[59:14] they've not come to an experience with
[59:16] jesus christ amen amen and that's what
[59:18] makes the difference friends amen when
[59:20] you begin to check your own life and you
[59:22] say well
[59:23] am i have i come to the church or have i
[59:26] really met christ
[59:28] amen i'll tell you how you'll know it
[59:30] once you have a hidden life in christ
[59:32] nobody else is in there with you friends
[59:35] this experience is not on the basis of a
[59:37] church or a group or a movement or a
[59:40] culture amen but it's you have passed
[59:42] the triple veil amen past the court of
[59:44] sanctification of public worship of
[59:47] church joining of holy living amen and
[59:50] you've gone in there where the shekinah
[59:52] glory is
[59:53] amen
[59:54] you're in christ
[59:56] and the world is not in there with you
[59:59] your parents are not there in there with
[1:00:00] you the pastor is not in there with you
[1:00:03] the prophet cannot enter there with you
[1:00:05] but you have entered into a fellowship
[1:00:08] with god
[1:00:09] amen that's on an individual basis
[1:00:12] amen there are many quotes for brother
[1:00:13] branham explains this message as a
[1:00:15] message to the individual it's not to
[1:00:16] the churches it's not to the nations
[1:00:18] it's to you
[1:00:20] it's to you amen
[1:00:22] personally god trying to reveal himself
[1:00:25] to you amen
[1:00:27] oh friends
[1:00:28] you in the kind of glory and nobody else
[1:00:31] figures into it
[1:00:32] then you'll be alive in there
[1:00:36] there's life
[1:00:37] in there but paul spoke of he said
[1:00:39] having therefore brethren boldness to
[1:00:41] enter into the holiest by the blood of
[1:00:43] jesus by a new and living way which he
[1:00:46] hath consecrated for us through the veil
[1:00:48] through the veil that's where christ is
[1:00:50] he's through the veil amen the bible
[1:00:52] said he's outside the camp amen when uh
[1:00:55] when the tabernacle was set up amongst
[1:00:57] children of israel in exodus the 33rd
[1:00:59] chapter it was outside the camp amen and
[1:01:02] all the people were part of the camp
[1:01:04] amen all the people the bible says that
[1:01:05] all the people of israel would come out
[1:01:07] into the door of their tent and they
[1:01:08] would watch as as moses would leave his
[1:01:10] tent and he would walk down the aisle of
[1:01:12] the congregation amen and he would go
[1:01:14] outside the gates to where the
[1:01:16] tabernacle of the congregation was amen
[1:01:18] and everybody was there to watch moses's
[1:01:20] walk everybody was there and they and
[1:01:22] when they when he went to that place the
[1:01:24] pillar of fire and the cloud came down
[1:01:26] and hovered over there and god spoke to
[1:01:28] his prophet face to face and the
[1:01:30] miraculous was witnessed the
[1:01:31] supernatural was seen amen uh you may be
[1:01:34] sitting here maybe you were in houston
[1:01:36] amen when the pillar of fire came and
[1:01:37] vindicated a message maybe you've maybe
[1:01:39] you're familiar with the stories you've
[1:01:41] seen the miracles say man you're you you
[1:01:44] can you can give an account friends amen
[1:01:47] but there was something that made the
[1:01:48] difference amen there was a there was a
[1:01:51] there was a point of contrast amen
[1:01:53] because when moses left that that
[1:01:55] sanctuary and he went back to the camp
[1:01:58] all the people that had one foot out
[1:02:00] into the aisle everybody was part of the
[1:02:01] meetings everybody was part of the
[1:02:03] church everybody believed god sent a
[1:02:05] prophet everybody witnessed the
[1:02:07] supernatural but they had one foot out
[1:02:09] and one foot back in their own tent
[1:02:12] and that's the problem that we've had
[1:02:13] around the message that it's the root of
[1:02:15] all of our problems brother aaron amen
[1:02:18] as people they got one foot in this
[1:02:19] message but one foot back in their own
[1:02:21] ideas or their own background amen or
[1:02:24] the way their old pastor used to teach
[1:02:25] it or the way they learned it in
[1:02:27] seminary or their old opinions or their
[1:02:29] own lifestyle or their own desires amen
[1:02:33] amen but you know there was somebody
[1:02:35] that was in that encampment amen that
[1:02:37] was called not only to be a witness to
[1:02:40] moses but he was actually called to be a
[1:02:42] fulfiller of everything that moses
[1:02:45] prophesied amen we know that was joshua
[1:02:48] amen joshua had a commission not just to
[1:02:51] believe god sent a prophet not just to
[1:02:53] be a part of his ministry not to just be
[1:02:54] a beneficiary of his teaching amen but
[1:02:57] he was called and elected amen who was
[1:03:00] and and position of the lord to be a
[1:03:02] possessor of everything god promised by
[1:03:05] the prophet moses
[1:03:06] that's a type of the bride of jesus
[1:03:08] christ amen and there was a difference
[1:03:10] when it came to joshua
[1:03:12] because the bible said when everybody
[1:03:14] else came and they had one foot in the
[1:03:16] camp one foot back in their own tent
[1:03:18] amen and watch what god did through a
[1:03:19] prophet then they went right back to
[1:03:21] their own tent
[1:03:23] but the bible says in that same chapter
[1:03:25] amen that joshua never departed from the
[1:03:29] tabernacle of god's presence amen amen
[1:03:32] that's the kind of life it will take to
[1:03:34] live this message to see this message
[1:03:36] fulfilled to take a rapture to witness
[1:03:39] the third poll amen to see all these
[1:03:42] things fulfill amen it will never be
[1:03:44] fulfilled amen by quote quotas and
[1:03:46] church joiners and people that were part
[1:03:48] of the movement or can tell the story's
[1:03:50] friends but but yet god is marching on
[1:03:53] god has raised up a joshua move amen but
[1:03:56] what we need is a caleb amen amen who
[1:03:58] will go with this word
[1:04:01] amen and go wherever it takes you
[1:04:03] friends
[1:04:04] and what is trying to what what god is
[1:04:06] trying to do through this message is
[1:04:08] call out to the individual to go beyond
[1:04:10] the camp as paul said as brother branham
[1:04:13] preached going beyond the camp
[1:04:15] amen beyond the crowd the social
[1:04:17] gathering and you as an individual got
[1:04:19] to go like joshua did into that holy of
[1:04:21] holies and never leave
[1:04:24] a true experience with god
[1:04:27] a true communion
[1:04:29] i i tell you friends there's a lot of
[1:04:31] people trying to quote their way into
[1:04:33] heaven
[1:04:34] a lot of people uh trying to get into
[1:04:37] heaven on what they witnessed in their
[1:04:38] life
[1:04:40] i mean no disrespect to those things i
[1:04:42] love those stories i reverence them
[1:04:44] but friends
[1:04:46] have we really got the bride to christ
[1:04:49] or have we built another church
[1:04:51] one thing i believe with all my heart is
[1:04:53] that this bride will not be a slightly
[1:04:55] better church with slightly better
[1:04:57] doctrine amen but she will be a people
[1:05:00] she will be made up of individuals amen
[1:05:03] who have gone beyond the court of
[1:05:05] religion gone beyond sanctification
[1:05:07] beyond a holy life beyond the knowledge
[1:05:10] of the word
[1:05:12] amen and come to know her husband jesus
[1:05:14] christ
[1:05:15] through a personal experience that's the
[1:05:17] bride
[1:05:18] that's the message friends oh brother
[1:05:21] braham said get in with christ
[1:05:23] shut off from the things of the world
[1:05:24] for to commune with him his pleasure
[1:05:27] amen it's beautiful friends so oh my i
[1:05:30] deal with so many young people that that
[1:05:32] are in that in that that that cycle of
[1:05:34] sanctification brother random talked
[1:05:35] about where he said you've got just
[1:05:37] enough religion to make yourself
[1:05:38] miserable amen there are miserable
[1:05:40] people trying to just live a religious
[1:05:42] life on their own trying to live up to a
[1:05:44] message
[1:05:45] and the dues and the don'ts amen and
[1:05:47] stuck in that cycle of sanctification
[1:05:49] friends and many of them make the
[1:05:51] mistake that because they are miserable
[1:05:54] that everyone else is miserable too and
[1:05:55] putting on a front friends but i believe
[1:05:58] there's a witness amongst the bride of
[1:05:59] jesus christ of the people that know the
[1:06:01] pleasures of a hidden life in christ the
[1:06:04] joys of his presence amen all the power
[1:06:08] of a life that's shut in with god
[1:06:10] amen the world is shut out and you're
[1:06:12] shut in with him it doesn't matter what
[1:06:14] society says what culture says what the
[1:06:17] churches are doing what what the critics
[1:06:19] are saying you're shut out from all
[1:06:20] those things you're in there with christ
[1:06:23] that's where the pleasures are that's
[1:06:24] where the man is always fresh
[1:06:26] that's where a dry branch that's been
[1:06:28] discouraged and damaged by the oh my
[1:06:31] what what what caused that branch to be
[1:06:33] dried out
[1:06:34] was the exposure to the environment of
[1:06:37] that desert
[1:06:39] amen and we've got a lot of people that
[1:06:41] have been exposed around this message to
[1:06:44] a lot of fake religion
[1:06:46] to a lot of hypocrisy we've seen
[1:06:48] churches rise and fall
[1:06:50] ministries rise and fall doctrines rise
[1:06:52] and fall
[1:06:53] and a lot of people got burnt out
[1:06:57] dried out
[1:06:59] oh my
[1:07:00] discouraged
[1:07:02] but in this experience
[1:07:04] in this presence
[1:07:06] in that holy of holies
[1:07:08] it doesn't matter what brother so and so
[1:07:10] did
[1:07:11] doesn't matter how she hurts you or he
[1:07:13] hurts you doesn't matter what you've
[1:07:15] been through it doesn't matter how
[1:07:17] damaged you've been how dried out you
[1:07:19] feel in there a dry branch brings forth
[1:07:22] buds and it brings forth an original
[1:07:24] fruit amen uh it has nothing to do with
[1:07:27] the environment it has nothing to do
[1:07:29] with the earth it's just the presence of
[1:07:31] god
[1:07:32] that's enriching that life and putting
[1:07:34] life and sap and greenness through that
[1:07:36] branch a god that can restore a god that
[1:07:39] can heal a god that can put the broken
[1:07:41] pieces together
[1:07:43] oh friends
[1:07:44] we need that i don't care how long
[1:07:46] you've been around how old you are how
[1:07:47] long ago you got the baptism the holy
[1:07:49] ghost and how far your experience goes
[1:07:51] day after day moment after moment we
[1:07:54] have a need to exist
[1:07:56] and persist in that presence of that
[1:07:58] shekinah
[1:08:00] it's the only thing that will
[1:08:02] help us to survive this world
[1:08:06] always said it's pleasure to commune
[1:08:08] with him as pleasure it's beautiful it's
[1:08:10] something that fills and satisfies the
[1:08:12] soul gives you peace that passes
[1:08:14] understanding all the crosses become
[1:08:16] flying wings all the burdens are chariot
[1:08:19] wheels oh you can fly away my burdens
[1:08:21] are light brother brown said yoke up
[1:08:23] with him the yoke is all padded with
[1:08:25] hallelujahs
[1:08:27] i think that's wonderful
[1:08:28] when when you're once inside the veil
[1:08:31] with him he
[1:08:32] becomes your life
[1:08:35] he becomes your life he's our source
[1:08:37] amen he's our uh he's our source
[1:08:40] like aaron's rod and the reason that
[1:08:42] many of our churches and many of our
[1:08:44] people are not bearing fruit the reason
[1:08:47] we're not seeing maybe the move of god
[1:08:49] like some of us remember it we're not
[1:08:50] seeing the supernatural like some
[1:08:52] remember it amen why why is it because
[1:08:55] amen that fruit only comes forth amen in
[1:08:58] the presence of the shekinah amen but
[1:09:01] many people have shut off amen they've
[1:09:03] shut off from the moving of the spirit
[1:09:05] amen it seemed like the holy ghost can't
[1:09:08] drop in a meeting like it used to
[1:09:10] hearts can't be moved like they used to
[1:09:12] there's a coldness there's a dryness a
[1:09:14] moment in his presence will take care of
[1:09:16] that
[1:09:17] amen a moment in his presence and a dead
[1:09:20] branch gives forth life
[1:09:22] amen we need that friends we need the
[1:09:24] real thing not an artificial believing
[1:09:27] not just belonging to a church amen but
[1:09:29] the bride of jesus christ amen of all
[1:09:32] people in this world ought to have a
[1:09:34] reality of an experience with god we
[1:09:36] ought to be witnessing the supernatural
[1:09:38] we ought to be seeing the reality
[1:09:41] of of of the life of christ amen
[1:09:44] here's why brother brahm said he's
[1:09:46] speaking of sanctification and hidden
[1:09:47] life in christ of course
[1:09:50] sometimes we make the mistake of
[1:09:51] thinking that all of our young people
[1:09:52] and our young believers understand all
[1:09:54] these things but brother bram's
[1:09:55] preaching about the tabernacle the old
[1:09:56] testament how it had three courts
[1:09:59] and the outer court was a public place
[1:10:00] where people would come and they would
[1:10:02] come and they would make sacrifice and
[1:10:04] things like that and people would mingle
[1:10:05] there would be fellowship there amen
[1:10:07] even unbelievers would would come into
[1:10:09] there at times and amen but that was
[1:10:11] that outer court brother braham said
[1:10:13] which represented justification is that
[1:10:15] right but then there's an inner court
[1:10:17] that people come to amen there's an
[1:10:19] inner court of sanctification and the
[1:10:21] only people in there was the priesthood
[1:10:23] the religious leaders the the ones that
[1:10:25] didn't dress like the world they they
[1:10:27] had a different dress they had a
[1:10:28] different mannerisms they had different
[1:10:30] actions amen and it was a it was a
[1:10:32] special people amen but there's a lot of
[1:10:34] deception in that inner court amen
[1:10:36] because in that inner court yeah
[1:10:38] everybody looks religious everybody
[1:10:40] everybody uh everybody uh can quote the
[1:10:42] qua everybody's familiar with the ritual
[1:10:44] of religion
[1:10:46] amen but that's not where god was
[1:10:48] god was not in the religious life god
[1:10:51] was not in the court of religion
[1:10:53] god was past that
[1:10:55] amen in the holy of holies where the
[1:10:57] shekinah was
[1:10:59] and brother branham and so it becomes
[1:11:01] very deceptive brother bran spoke about
[1:11:02] it how that sanctification he said that
[1:11:04] inner court had light
[1:11:06] that he said they had light too
[1:11:08] amen but it was artificial light
[1:11:11] it was artificial light he said now what
[1:11:13] was that artificial light of the of the
[1:11:16] experience of sanctification he said it
[1:11:18] was a seven point lamp to give them
[1:11:20] light
[1:11:21] amen it was a seven point lamp amen but
[1:11:24] the lights got low he said they would
[1:11:26] get smoked up the lights would go out
[1:11:27] they had to be relit because it was an
[1:11:29] artificial light in the court of
[1:11:31] sanctification brother sister and that's
[1:11:33] right where we make our mistake where
[1:11:35] the deception is because what we have
[1:11:36] around churches and what we have around
[1:11:38] religions brother braham said the most
[1:11:40] deceitful thing is for somebody to think
[1:11:42] they're a christian but they're not and
[1:11:43] why would they think they're a christian
[1:11:45] why they belong to the church and they
[1:11:46] pay their tithes and they sing the songs
[1:11:48] and they're familiar with the doctrine
[1:11:49] and they dress the part and they act the
[1:11:51] part and so and so well i'm i'm part of
[1:11:54] a church i'm living this religious life
[1:11:57] but it's sanctification masquerading as
[1:11:59] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:12:02] amen bro and that's
[1:12:04] and yeah it looks the part it dresses
[1:12:06] the part and it can talk to talk friends
[1:12:09] amen you see what that artificial light
[1:12:11] was under those seven candlesticks and
[1:12:13] so we've seen many people rise up that
[1:12:15] they can quote the quotes and all their
[1:12:17] diagrams are right and they can explain
[1:12:18] all the mysteries and the doctrines and
[1:12:20] intellectually they've got such a grasp
[1:12:22] of this message but what's lacking is
[1:12:24] life
[1:12:25] life on the inside life that can that
[1:12:27] can hold that life and keep it out of a
[1:12:29] backslidden condition and can bring
[1:12:31] forth the works of this message and
[1:12:33] bring it to pass and fulfill it in a
[1:12:35] real and a tangible way
[1:12:38] not just knowledge of the word friends
[1:12:40] i'll tell you what that is you may be up
[1:12:42] to date on your doctrine but you're
[1:12:43] still living in the glare of another age
[1:12:45] amen talking about that you can talk
[1:12:47] about doctrines and the reformations of
[1:12:49] the church ages and fellowship in the
[1:12:51] inner court you've got your candlesticks
[1:12:52] arranged and your diagrams drawn amen
[1:12:54] you can quote all the quotes but be
[1:12:56] artificial friends there's more for us
[1:13:00] there's more for the bride of jesus
[1:13:02] christ friends i don't believe god sent
[1:13:04] a prophet to educate us about seven
[1:13:06] church ages but he came to usher us in
[1:13:09] amen to experience with god he called it
[1:13:11] a bright age amen we're in the middle of
[1:13:14] laodicea there would be a people amen
[1:13:17] that that we're not part of this culture
[1:13:19] part of this world not under this
[1:13:21] laodicean curse not naked not wretched
[1:13:24] not poor amen but married to her husband
[1:13:28] one with christ in a real experience
[1:13:31] with god friends a reality amen
[1:13:34] it doesn't matter your pedigree it
[1:13:36] doesn't matter your knowledge of the
[1:13:37] word if you've fallen short amen of our
[1:13:40] true experience with god personally
[1:13:42] friends then there's not enough not
[1:13:44] enough sanctification in this world not
[1:13:46] enough quotes
[1:13:47] that can save you
[1:13:49] amen but salvation
[1:13:52] amen rapture
[1:13:53] the third poll power
[1:13:55] supernatural amen to be the bride
[1:13:59] it's all in christ it's all in him the
[1:14:02] message came to introduce us to him
[1:14:06] it's my appeal to the church
[1:14:08] are we really getting the people to
[1:14:09] christ
[1:14:11] or are we just getting them to the
[1:14:12] message
[1:14:15] amen yeah i know you're an experienced
[1:14:16] church he said no
[1:14:18] amen this is not a strange thing that
[1:14:20] i'm speaking to you you've witnessed it
[1:14:22] some of you maybe have experienced it
[1:14:24] friends but i'm not content
[1:14:26] to live a layouty in existence i'm not
[1:14:29] trying to take this message and cause it
[1:14:31] to be compatible with the age that i'm
[1:14:33] living in the society or the culture
[1:14:34] that i'm living in i'm not trying to i i
[1:14:37] when i approach the ministry when i
[1:14:39] approach preaching this word preaching
[1:14:41] this message i'm not trying to move it
[1:14:43] along in a way that'll just build a
[1:14:45] church or or or we'll just try to bring
[1:14:47] things up to date or make it make it
[1:14:49] more acceptable amen to this world
[1:14:52] friends but i'm clinging to this word
[1:14:54] amen because what it is to me is more
[1:14:56] than a system of belief it's more than
[1:14:58] what daddy believed or mama believed or
[1:15:00] pastor believed it's more than what what
[1:15:03] this brother preacher that one or what
[1:15:04] that church stood for it's christ amen
[1:15:07] it's christ in me the hope of glory it's
[1:15:10] his reality it's his fellowship amen
[1:15:12] it's his presence in my life it is the
[1:15:15] shekinah glory brother brahm said it's
[1:15:17] the same pillar of fire amen but it's
[1:15:20] not hanging over a camp now it's not
[1:15:22] hanging over a nation or a people or
[1:15:24] even a church
[1:15:26] amen but he said on the day of pentecost
[1:15:28] that pillar of fire broke itself up and
[1:15:31] now those little those little licks of
[1:15:33] fire have been tabernacled in
[1:15:35] individuals in this day friends what am
[1:15:37] i talking about i'm talking about that
[1:15:39] old-fashioned baptism of the holy ghost
[1:15:41] friends amen but more than what the
[1:15:43] pentecostals have more than what luther
[1:15:45] or wesley had but by the light of the
[1:15:47] message we understand what the baptism
[1:15:49] of the holy ghost is it is the person of
[1:15:51] jesus christ his literal life
[1:15:54] tabernacled in the individual
[1:15:56] christ in you the hope of glory
[1:15:59] what an offer
[1:16:01] what a privilege to be his temple to be
[1:16:03] his tabernacle to dwell there with him
[1:16:06] between the wings of the cherubim
[1:16:09] you say brother nathan i'm nothing
[1:16:11] everything that i've tried has failed
[1:16:13] everything i've gone after has fallen
[1:16:15] apart and i'm nothing in my flesh that's
[1:16:17] the point amen amen but you are that
[1:16:20] of wood of the old testament amen
[1:16:22] that now glee desert wood not good for
[1:16:25] much amen but but but the but the
[1:16:28] prophet took that word and shaped it
[1:16:30] just right
[1:16:31] amen amen and then what did he do he
[1:16:34] poured it over with gold the ark of the
[1:16:36] covenant on it oh well on the exterior
[1:16:40] it's just the wood which is representing
[1:16:41] humanity it has flaws it has knotted up
[1:16:44] places it's rough friends it's not
[1:16:48] valuable but because god poured his
[1:16:50] glory out on that wood he has made this
[1:16:53] bride the very tabernacle of his deity
[1:16:56] he has covered you with himself his
[1:16:59] character is of you his attributes are
[1:17:01] of you his name amen is your
[1:17:04] identification
[1:17:06] what a message
[1:17:07] hallelujah i'm not content with laodicea
[1:17:10] i want to be in there in that little
[1:17:12] room amen where the shekinah glory is i
[1:17:15] want to dwell between the wings of the
[1:17:16] cherubim amen in an experience with god
[1:17:19] amen that doesn't need refreshed on
[1:17:21] sunday morning amen i don't need my fire
[1:17:24] i don't want to get smoked up and need
[1:17:26] relit and smoke up and relit i don't
[1:17:28] want the i don't want the flickering
[1:17:30] light of just knowing about the church
[1:17:32] ages and just getting all my
[1:17:34] candlesticks right i want to be in there
[1:17:36] in the shekinah glory where there's a
[1:17:39] supernatural glow of his presence and
[1:17:41] christ is the light the very pillar of
[1:17:43] fire himself an eternal flame that never
[1:17:46] flickers
[1:17:47] it never is extinguished
[1:17:49] it burns
[1:17:50] on monday on tuesday on wednesday on
[1:17:52] thursday
[1:17:54] on friday and saturday it burned through
[1:17:56] it burned way back before there was a
[1:17:58] world and as eternity rolls it will burn
[1:18:00] on
[1:18:01] amen and the very flame that's in me by
[1:18:03] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:18:04] when what a statement this is i believe
[1:18:07] it by election to be a part of that
[1:18:09] original flame
[1:18:11] it cannot burn out friends
[1:18:14] oh it's what we need brother brown said
[1:18:15] the man who entered in and the veil fell
[1:18:17] behind him he didn't depend on the
[1:18:18] sunlight the starlight or the moonlight
[1:18:21] or the seven golden candlesticks
[1:18:24] amen friends that's what'll that's
[1:18:26] what'll get you somewhere with god is
[1:18:27] not what you know or how you got all the
[1:18:29] mysteries figured out and you could look
[1:18:30] at the blood moons and the star
[1:18:32] arrangements and conspiracy theories and
[1:18:34] and all of those kind of things
[1:18:37] no but in there the shekinah glory of
[1:18:39] the lord was in there and he lived
[1:18:42] whether the clouds were going on whether
[1:18:44] the rain was falling whether thunder was
[1:18:46] rolling whether an army was coming it
[1:18:48] didn't mean a bit of difference to him
[1:18:50] he was protected
[1:18:52] he was in the shekinah glory living in
[1:18:54] the presence of god brother braham gets
[1:18:56] excited he says hallelujah
[1:18:59] he said you think i'm a holy roller
[1:19:00] maybe i am
[1:19:02] let me tell you something brother this
[1:19:04] is the words of a prophet now if it
[1:19:06] takes a call to a holy roller to live in
[1:19:08] the shekinah glory let me stay with god
[1:19:10] in the shekinah glory and call it what
[1:19:11] you want to friends
[1:19:13] that's kind of how i feel about it you
[1:19:14] know i would rather be called a whooping
[1:19:16] hollering fanatic and know that i've got
[1:19:18] something real amen then have all of my
[1:19:20] candlesticks polished and all of my
[1:19:22] constellations named and be an
[1:19:24] artificial life friends but what i'm
[1:19:26] looking for and what this message has
[1:19:28] promised with me and what i've
[1:19:30] experienced in the message of the hour
[1:19:32] is a reality of the knowledge of god
[1:19:35] personally oh friends i'm not talking
[1:19:37] about shouting with the crowd i'm
[1:19:39] talking about being shut in with god oh
[1:19:42] brother grant said no matter how much
[1:19:43] you shout
[1:19:45] or how or what you try to do if you
[1:19:46] haven't got a life that your neighbor
[1:19:48] knows you're a christian there's
[1:19:49] something wrong somewhere sure we've
[1:19:50] seen a lot of people that can shout and
[1:19:52] they can jump and dance but they got no
[1:19:54] life behind it amen we know these things
[1:19:56] but here's what a prophet said he said
[1:19:58] but there's nobody in the world believes
[1:20:00] in any old time shouting and blessing
[1:20:02] god and praising god than i do
[1:20:05] amen i'm coming to something here i
[1:20:06] believe that a baby that's born and it
[1:20:09] doesn't move it doesn't whimper
[1:20:11] it doesn't do anything
[1:20:12] he said you know what the doctor does
[1:20:14] he gives it a good spank
[1:20:17] that gets some breath in him he said
[1:20:19] that's the matter what's with the church
[1:20:20] when people say yeah i'm born again he
[1:20:22] said you know what it is it's a
[1:20:23] stillborn dead baby it needs a little
[1:20:26] gospel spanking once in a while that'll
[1:20:28] wake it up and get it to whining and
[1:20:29] crying and get some life into it friend
[1:20:31] you just excuse me amen but i i i
[1:20:34] personally believe that in this lukewarm
[1:20:36] age that we're living in we need a
[1:20:37] little bit of fiery preaching that will
[1:20:39] that will uh smack that spiritual
[1:20:41] deadness out of the church
[1:20:43] we need a we need our minds stirred to
[1:20:45] remember it sometimes amen amen of the
[1:20:47] glory of this word that we have received
[1:20:49] amen amen you know there's a lot of
[1:20:51] people shouting and they got nothing in
[1:20:53] them amen nothing in them really but if
[1:20:55] the bride of jesus christ doesn't have
[1:20:57] something to shout about
[1:20:59] amen then oh
[1:21:01] where of all men most miserable
[1:21:04] amen but you know what we need to do is
[1:21:06] find out whether we're alive or not
[1:21:08] that's my title this morning aren't you
[1:21:09] alive in there amen oh because in there
[1:21:12] brother brahms said that's a place in
[1:21:14] that strong tower where you can let off
[1:21:15] the steam you can let off the pressure
[1:21:17] amen and we find that we've got people
[1:21:19] that are so pressured by this age so
[1:21:22] under the so under the just the weight
[1:21:24] and the heaviness of this of this time
[1:21:26] that we're living in until the people
[1:21:27] just gotten closed up and dried out and
[1:21:30] cooled off friends oh god amen but oh
[1:21:34] amen uh but there is a there is an
[1:21:36] experience with god amen where you can
[1:21:38] just let that off friends that's why we
[1:21:40] find many times uh with our young people
[1:21:43] you know that uh that that that will get
[1:21:45] them into meetings and the holy ghost
[1:21:46] starts to move and falling on lives and
[1:21:48] people tend to get a little noisy
[1:21:50] brother aaron amen why because they're
[1:21:52] under so much pressure amen and they're
[1:21:54] so bound up by the chains of laodicea
[1:21:56] when those chains fall it makes a noise
[1:21:58] amen i'm a witness personally friends
[1:22:02] amen that that uh that's the reason
[1:22:03] sometimes we see noise in our we have
[1:22:06] noise in our services we got people
[1:22:07] saying amen we got smiles we've got
[1:22:10] we've got rejoicing we've got dancing
[1:22:12] we've got all those things amen what is
[1:22:14] it because people are under pressure
[1:22:16] amen and they've found a place where
[1:22:18] they can let it off
[1:22:21] hallelujah i i i wrestled with the lord
[1:22:24] to go
[1:22:25] in this direction because
[1:22:27] i i wanted to give a testimony from our
[1:22:29] youth camp we had over there and it's
[1:22:30] just not in my nature to to come off
[1:22:33] like self-promoting but
[1:22:35] i'll trust in your discernment to see my
[1:22:37] spirit tonight but we had a we had a we
[1:22:39] had a youth camp and this this year
[1:22:42] earlier this year
[1:22:43] amen oh my the lord met us there amen it
[1:22:46] was just uh it was a wonderful time and
[1:22:48] we had a little screaming and shouting
[1:22:50] and and whooping hollering and dancing
[1:22:52] and all those things and of course when
[1:22:53] you have meetings like that then
[1:22:54] criticisms come and you know we're
[1:22:56] accustomed to those things and we aren't
[1:22:57] really bow into those things but but you
[1:23:00] know there was one young person that
[1:23:01] went home and gave a testimony in their
[1:23:03] church and it meant quite a lot to me
[1:23:04] and i think even out of the words of a
[1:23:06] young person it's an example to many of
[1:23:08] our older ones
[1:23:09] he said that how he's there at camp and
[1:23:12] then this one would take off screaming
[1:23:14] her this one would get get under the
[1:23:15] anointing and begin to you know make a
[1:23:17] noise or a dance or something like that
[1:23:18] and he said i was so critical he said
[1:23:21] until i was looking around
[1:23:22] and i would see this one get touched and
[1:23:24] i'd say is that right
[1:23:26] is that right
[1:23:27] is that right
[1:23:28] is that right is that right you know
[1:23:30] because we're believers we know a lot
[1:23:32] we've been taught a lot we've seen a lot
[1:23:34] of false
[1:23:35] we've seen a lot of fanaticism we've
[1:23:36] seen a lot of wildfire friends and so
[1:23:39] he's so under that until i like the
[1:23:40] phrase that he was for it he said i was
[1:23:42] micromanaging god
[1:23:46] until you and then that the way that we
[1:23:47] get we get so super spiritual till god
[1:23:49] can't touch somebody unless god does it
[1:23:51] the way that we think is appropriate
[1:23:54] amen
[1:23:55] but god is not bound by those things he
[1:23:57] said you know and so they say there he
[1:23:59] is saying is that right is that right is
[1:24:01] that right until sunday morning the
[1:24:03] preacher said something over the pulpit
[1:24:04] he said it was the voice of god spoke
[1:24:06] directly to me spoke directly to me and
[1:24:08] next thing he knew said i was out there
[1:24:10] dancing with him amen amen friends uh uh
[1:24:14] here here's here's a life that that that
[1:24:16] so part of the group so much in
[1:24:18] sanctification and legalism and religion
[1:24:22] until here god's pouring a spirit out
[1:24:24] and all that's in this heart to do is is
[1:24:26] that right is that right is that one
[1:24:28] right is that is that correct is that
[1:24:30] appropriate friends but here's how you
[1:24:32] know when you're shutting with god it
[1:24:34] doesn't matter what anyone else is doing
[1:24:36] amen because nobody's in there with you
[1:24:39] oh but in the presence of god amen let
[1:24:42] them shout or not shout let them
[1:24:43] criticize or not criticize the beauty of
[1:24:46] it is here this brothers under this
[1:24:47] weight of criticism a critical spirit
[1:24:50] and legalism
[1:24:51] and criticizing everybody but they
[1:24:53] weren't thinking about him
[1:24:55] they were in shut in with god with a
[1:24:57] worship with a praise
[1:25:00] friends
[1:25:01] and i've got enough testimonies come in
[1:25:03] to know that something real was done it
[1:25:05] wasn't wildfire
[1:25:07] to me france
[1:25:08] but that's when you've gone past the
[1:25:10] veil that's what i'm talking about when
[1:25:11] you're in christ and it doesn't matter
[1:25:13] what anyone else thinks or does you're
[1:25:15] in there with him
[1:25:16] nobody can go in there with you
[1:25:19] nobody can enter there with you
[1:25:21] it's you and god look at the lame man at
[1:25:23] the gate
[1:25:25] amen you might have been walking down
[1:25:27] the street that day and here comes some
[1:25:28] man whooping and hollering and jumping
[1:25:29] around
[1:25:30] and you say my that brother got a little
[1:25:33] emotional
[1:25:34] amen and you might have thought that
[1:25:36] that he got a little bit in the flesh
[1:25:37] unless you'd seen him the day before
[1:25:41] friends
[1:25:42] you might think brother nathan you're
[1:25:44] you're just really an emotional young
[1:25:46] preacher and give it a few years you'll
[1:25:47] cool off and you'll mature and all those
[1:25:50] things oh friends you don't know where
[1:25:52] i've been you don't know where i've come
[1:25:53] from you don't know what i've
[1:25:54] experienced
[1:25:56] amen see don't throw my experience out
[1:25:58] because it doesn't match yours and i
[1:26:00] won't do for the same for you
[1:26:02] there's a lot of people sitting in
[1:26:03] churches you know it's just not in their
[1:26:05] nature to shout or dance or things but
[1:26:07] they can say amen and a quiet amen
[1:26:10] amen has an anointing on it that brings
[1:26:12] a uh it brings a presence it brings in
[1:26:15] it brings a an atmosphere into the
[1:26:17] church where lives can be touched
[1:26:19] because of a quiet solid amen but it's
[1:26:22] got to be genuine
[1:26:24] it's got to be genuine
[1:26:26] it's got to be an honest and sincere
[1:26:29] reaction to the presence of god
[1:26:32] amen it's easy to dismiss the hour is
[1:26:34] this okay it's easy to dismiss the
[1:26:37] outward manifestation until you know the
[1:26:39] full story amen
[1:26:40] amen and again forgive me for i i don't
[1:26:44] mean to talk about the home church there
[1:26:46] but we're really excited about what the
[1:26:47] lord's done since this youth camp the
[1:26:49] number of young people that have been
[1:26:50] baptized in the church has entered the
[1:26:51] double digits i think our 10th and 11th
[1:26:53] and maybe 12th are being baptized this
[1:26:55] morning at home and and and and friends
[1:26:58] that's something sovereign that's
[1:27:00] something that only god can do but we
[1:27:02] need it amen we need the moving of the
[1:27:04] spirit in the church we need lies and we
[1:27:06] need people to encounter christ because
[1:27:09] the knowledge of this message as
[1:27:10] wonderful and and as precious as these
[1:27:13] doctrines and these teachings are to us
[1:27:16] there's they cannot transform they
[1:27:19] cannot take you and usher you from
[1:27:21] sanctification into the holy of holies
[1:27:24] only a an experience with the shekinah
[1:27:27] glory can do it you got to come like
[1:27:29] moses and moses was a message believer
[1:27:31] moses was a young person who was raised
[1:27:34] in the message as we would say he cut
[1:27:36] his teeth on a message pew as i would
[1:27:38] say he was a message brat
[1:27:40] amen he was familiar with the teaching
[1:27:42] his mother
[1:27:44] taught him the message for his day he
[1:27:46] was from a young age he was instructed
[1:27:48] and he sincerely brother aaron with all
[1:27:51] his heart believed that message he
[1:27:53] believed he was to be the deliverer
[1:27:56] he believed he was to lead the children
[1:27:57] of israel out of bondage that's what he
[1:27:58] was taught his whole life
[1:28:01] but when he took it into his own hands
[1:28:02] to try to live something and here's
[1:28:04] where young people stumble try to take
[1:28:06] this message and live it in our own
[1:28:08] efforts
[1:28:10] by virtue of who we are because we're a
[1:28:12] deacon or because we're a preacher or
[1:28:13] because we're
[1:28:14] whatever we are
[1:28:16] amen then we find that you you'll end up
[1:28:19] like moses
[1:28:20] you'll kill about one egyptian what a
[1:28:22] deliverance
[1:28:23] and it'll take sometimes years in the
[1:28:26] backside of the wilderness getting all
[1:28:27] that pride beat out of you until you
[1:28:29] come to the knowledge and some people
[1:28:31] come late i had a brother just just a
[1:28:33] couple weeks ago it's why i'm preaching
[1:28:34] these things but i was preaching along
[1:28:36] this line a brother came up and this
[1:28:38] brother been around the message for
[1:28:40] decades and he came up to the altar at
[1:28:41] the end of service he said brother
[1:28:43] nathan
[1:28:44] i know a lot about god
[1:28:46] i know a lot
[1:28:48] i've been around a long time
[1:28:50] but i don't know him
[1:28:53] i thought that was quite something for
[1:28:54] for a veteran brother to admit
[1:28:57] i don't know him
[1:28:59] and there are a lot of people
[1:29:01] in the pressures of this world
[1:29:03] the pressures of laodicea
[1:29:05] trying to eke out in existence down here
[1:29:09] amen
[1:29:10] but you don't know him
[1:29:12] and that's why it's miserable
[1:29:14] oh but in his
[1:29:16] presence our joys forevermore a day in
[1:29:18] his courts is better than a thousand
[1:29:20] elsewhere there's a real experience with
[1:29:22] god to be had i don't know if i've been
[1:29:24] lengthy or not i haven't been watching
[1:29:25] the clock please excuse me
[1:29:27] amen but you know uh uh brother braham
[1:29:30] said we don't have to get some kind of
[1:29:31] emotional or mental makeup he said we
[1:29:33] can get not only a mouthful but a
[1:29:35] soulful
[1:29:36] of the original baptism of the holy
[1:29:38] ghost on the day of pentecost and it'll
[1:29:40] bring the same results as it did on the
[1:29:42] day of pentecost you know that the
[1:29:44] pentecostal experience is for today amen
[1:29:46] i know that people around this message
[1:29:48] and teachers have tried to put it in the
[1:29:49] past brother branham said uh uh it was
[1:29:52] 1964 1965 he said that uh that the
[1:29:56] i believe that uh he said i believe
[1:29:57] pentecost is to all times it began
[1:30:00] without an ending he said the
[1:30:01] pentecostal blessings must remain among
[1:30:03] some people amen 1964 brother branham
[1:30:06] said that yeah the church is today they
[1:30:08] don't want a lot of they don't want a
[1:30:09] lot of emotion they don't want the
[1:30:11] moving the spirit they don't want these
[1:30:12] things brother branham said it was like
[1:30:13] a woman amen who doesn't want to bring
[1:30:15] forth children because it will ruin her
[1:30:17] body he said that's the churches of
[1:30:19] today have become so dignified until
[1:30:21] they don't want any moving of the spirit
[1:30:24] and this is and the shame of it is this
[1:30:26] is describing many of our message
[1:30:27] churches and many of the teaching that
[1:30:29] goes on around this message but brother
[1:30:31] branham said amen she don't want any of
[1:30:33] those whooping crying hollering
[1:30:35] tongue-talking pentecostal babies but he
[1:30:37] said it's the only kind the word of god
[1:30:40] produces
[1:30:41] 1964. i got several hundred more if
[1:30:43] you're interested but we're trying to
[1:30:46] move on with a different thought here
[1:30:47] amen
[1:30:48] amen you know brother branson said his
[1:30:50] first time amongst the pentecostals he
[1:30:51] saw a lot of the young preachers
[1:30:52] preaching and he said i thought they
[1:30:53] were kind of noisy
[1:30:55] he said but you know if you're not a
[1:30:56] little noisy it's a sign that you're
[1:30:58] dead
[1:30:59] amen oh my anything without emotion is
[1:31:02] dead
[1:31:03] i know that's the evangelist's favorite
[1:31:04] quote
[1:31:05] but it's true
[1:31:08] amen but you know speaking of this holy
[1:31:10] of holies
[1:31:11] brother branson spoke about aaron and
[1:31:14] aaron was the high priest he was he's
[1:31:17] the type of the true believer because
[1:31:18] he's the one that went past the
[1:31:20] religious people past the priesthood
[1:31:22] past the rights of religion and he was
[1:31:25] the one who had the privilege to enter
[1:31:26] beyond the veil into the holy of holies
[1:31:29] and witness the shekinah glory
[1:31:32] and we find that there were there was a
[1:31:33] holiness there was a there was a
[1:31:35] sanctification that was required he had
[1:31:37] to eat right he had to dress right he
[1:31:39] had to walk right
[1:31:40] he had to he had to dress a certain way
[1:31:42] amen there was things required of him
[1:31:44] religious uh things amen but those
[1:31:47] things were for the purpose
[1:31:49] of
[1:31:50] of of of of permitting him to go into
[1:31:53] that presence and when he went in
[1:31:54] brother braham said he had he had
[1:31:56] something on his robe a bell and a
[1:31:57] pomegranate and he had to walk a certain
[1:32:00] way brother brown said amen so that it
[1:32:02] would make a noise
[1:32:05] it would make a noise his walk would
[1:32:07] cause a noise brother bram said it would
[1:32:08] play a song of holy holy holy unto the
[1:32:11] lord
[1:32:12] amen and and he said and he had to walk
[1:32:14] and he had to make that noise any
[1:32:16] brother man said the only way the people
[1:32:18] outside knew that he was alive in there
[1:32:20] was because he made a noise friends
[1:32:23] amen so i'm challenging you with this
[1:32:24] word tonight are you alive in there amen
[1:32:27] is do you have the joy of the lord like
[1:32:29] you used to can you say amen to the word
[1:32:31] like you used to is the is there a
[1:32:32] movement there is there a reaction is
[1:32:34] there a noise in your life is there a
[1:32:36] worship
[1:32:37] or have you succumbed to the cold winds
[1:32:39] of this lay out of cn age
[1:32:42] old friends are you alive in there see
[1:32:44] that's what i'm going after i'm not
[1:32:45] trying to just be noisy or work up some
[1:32:46] emotion i it's a genuine question to the
[1:32:49] church are you alive
[1:32:51] in there amen
[1:32:53] oh
[1:32:54] my then if you're alive in the air then
[1:32:56] we ought to ring that bell and
[1:32:57] pomegranate if there's a life there
[1:32:59] ought to be a noise because it's a
[1:33:00] witness to the church it's a witness to
[1:33:02] this world that there's something going
[1:33:04] on in when this world's as dead as it
[1:33:06] can be when people are wandering in this
[1:33:08] wilderness friends i'm shutting with god
[1:33:10] and there's life in there there's joy in
[1:33:12] there there's peace in there that's why
[1:33:14] i make a noise that's why my life has a
[1:33:16] worship it has a reaction to the word of
[1:33:18] god
[1:33:19] why because i'm alive friend so i so i
[1:33:22] ring my bell amen just like that old
[1:33:24] liberty bell one of the great symbols of
[1:33:26] our country you know that old liberty
[1:33:28] bell is an old landmark of freedom that
[1:33:30] we know very well as americans but you
[1:33:32] know that bell has been cracked and worn
[1:33:35] down and they don't ring it anymore but
[1:33:37] all around the country there's there's
[1:33:39] there's there's there's duplicates that
[1:33:41] have been struck off of that original
[1:33:42] bell and when it comes to independence
[1:33:44] day they began to ring those bells as a
[1:33:47] testimony not that we were free but we
[1:33:50] ring the liberty bells to testify to
[1:33:52] this world that we're still free we are
[1:33:55] free we have liberty
[1:33:57] amen
[1:33:58] that's what i believe the bride of
[1:33:59] christ has a right to to liberty to
[1:34:01] worship god liberty to to pull on the
[1:34:04] word liberty to express her joy and her
[1:34:06] peace and it's a testimony to this dying
[1:34:09] world
[1:34:11] amen when men are so miserable just like
[1:34:14] israel at the red sea brother man said
[1:34:15] you know what happened moses danced in
[1:34:17] the spirit and miriam beat a tambourine
[1:34:19] and all the daughters of israel and they
[1:34:21] ran up and down the banks dancing in the
[1:34:23] spirit he said if that ain't a
[1:34:24] pentecostal meaning i don't know what
[1:34:25] one is

[1:35:19] i'm not emotional about it
[1:35:24] amen you keep that religion
[1:35:26] give me that old-time religion
[1:35:28] that all the prophets of the old
[1:35:29] testament had every time they came into
[1:35:31] the presence of god they fainted they
[1:35:33] they they passed out they were overcome
[1:35:36] they were awestruck by the presence of
[1:35:38] god and here we're preaching the literal
[1:35:40] life of jesus christ present in the
[1:35:42] bride of jesus christ
[1:35:44] and trying to strip the bride to strip
[1:35:46] the churches of any emotion god forbid

[1:35:57] have witnessed by this message he saw
[1:35:59] the lord upon his throne

[1:36:03] of jesus christ amen he saw him on his
[1:36:06] throne there amongst all the seraphims

[1:37:11] good things to say about me when she
[1:37:13] when she begins to open her heart to me
[1:37:15] and i believe it pleases the lord for
[1:37:17] his people to worship him

[1:37:22] amen isaiah saw this
[1:37:25] isaiah came into the presence of the
[1:37:26] lord and there was an emotion he was

[1:37:31] unclean lips
[1:37:32] friends you talk about this message what
[1:37:35] it means to me as a young man when i
[1:37:37] when i went past amen just the message
[1:37:40] that that that my parents taught me when
[1:37:42] they became more than what i heard over
[1:37:44] the pulpit since i was a little boy and
[1:37:46] i began to crack these the books of this
[1:37:48] message open for the first time and see
[1:37:50] the words the words just jump off the
[1:37:52] page and become a reality to me when i
[1:37:55] re i remember where i was amen where i
[1:37:57] was going what i was feeling the first
[1:38:00] time i read christ the mystery of god
[1:38:01] revealed and saw the revelation of
[1:38:03] christ in me the hope of glory friends
[1:38:05] it's everything to me amen and and and i
[1:38:08] i'm here to tell you there's a genuine
[1:38:10] reaction in my heart what an all there
[1:38:12] is i'll never forget it friends over and
[1:38:14] over time i've been moved to tears by
[1:38:16] this message amen why because to me it's
[1:38:19] not more than a teaching it's more than
[1:38:21] the beliefs of a man or the thoughts of
[1:38:23] a man but it's the body word of the son
[1:38:25] of man becoming a reality to me it's
[1:38:28] everything to me it gives me joy it
[1:38:30] gives me peace it causes me to so some
[1:38:33] days it causes me to shout some days it
[1:38:35] causes me to to dance some days it
[1:38:37] causes me to cry some days it causes me
[1:38:40] to bow my head in meditation
[1:38:43] amen
[1:38:44] but one thing i am is free
[1:38:46] free to express back to god the genuine
[1:38:49] and honest reactions of my heart amen to
[1:38:52] the revelation of this word friends
[1:38:54] anything else oh oh when when the joy
[1:38:57] begins to fill me when i when i begin to
[1:38:58] see the victory of the church when i
[1:39:00] begin to see the inevitability of this
[1:39:02] bride of the potential in her that will
[1:39:04] be realized to take a rapture to
[1:39:06] overcome laodicea
[1:39:08] how could i not shout it would be a sin
[1:39:10] not to shout
[1:39:11] because it would be a dishonesty because
[1:39:14] it's in my heart
[1:39:16] and so what i'm teaching this morning is
[1:39:18] don't be anybody you're not
[1:39:20] don't try to copy anyone else or imitate
[1:39:22] anyone else's experience but be free be
[1:39:26] free to express to god
[1:39:29] amen the genuine reaction of of this
[1:39:32] word and you know people will criticize
[1:39:34] it but
[1:39:35] amen
[1:39:36] after the way that's called heresy so
[1:39:38] worship by the god of my fathers
[1:39:40] brother brahm said criticism is on
[1:39:42] account of the word of god is only
[1:39:43] growing pains of his grace
[1:39:45] amen
[1:39:47] there will be
[1:39:49] a reaction every prophet that
[1:39:51] experienced this presence was affected
[1:39:53] brother branham said brother braham said
[1:39:56] oh he said those revelations in the
[1:39:57] presence of that ball of fire hanging
[1:39:59] there in the room he said brother
[1:40:01] since i was a child
[1:40:03] every time it comes near me it alarms me
[1:40:06] it almost puts me in an unconscious
[1:40:08] condition you never get used to it you
[1:40:10] can't
[1:40:11] it's too sacred
[1:40:13] give me that religion
[1:40:15] a god that can be experienced
[1:40:17] a god that can come down a godda can
[1:40:19] speak to me you know when i'm
[1:40:20] discouraged how many times amen brother
[1:40:23] aaron has he come to you in the car
[1:40:24] or in the shower or in your bedroom or
[1:40:27] in your prayer closet or whatever it is
[1:40:29] brother ed he comes and
[1:40:31] amen you're not even thinking about god
[1:40:33] you've got your mind on maybe the the
[1:40:35] pressures of this life or the duties of
[1:40:37] a of a husband and a father and those
[1:40:39] things are weighing heavy on you and all
[1:40:41] of a sudden your mind just goes to a
[1:40:42] scripture or a quote or to a song and
[1:40:45] the presence of god comes down right
[1:40:46] where you are
[1:40:48] and speaks to you that's real that's
[1:40:50] true that's that's him
[1:40:52] you don't get used to that
[1:40:55] amen there's a lot of people trying to
[1:40:57] masquerade
[1:40:59] sanctification
[1:41:00] as a real experience with god but
[1:41:02] friends
[1:41:03] if it's a real experience with god
[1:41:05] amen it doesn't get
[1:41:08] it doesn't it it's not cold it's not
[1:41:10] unfeeling
[1:41:11] it's real
[1:41:13] it's real
[1:41:15] i know this message has gotten so
[1:41:16] religious and complicated to people
[1:41:19] where the teaching has become so
[1:41:20] advanced and things until
[1:41:22] they become afraid of any emotion
[1:41:24] like it would be it would be pentecostal
[1:41:26] which is apparently a dirty word now or
[1:41:28] that it would be wildfire it'd be
[1:41:30] fanaticism you know there's an old song
[1:41:33] that does away with all those teachings
[1:41:35] and doctrines and
[1:41:36] it makes it real simple
[1:41:40] and the words go like this i sing
[1:41:43] because
[1:41:46] i shout
[1:41:48] because
[1:41:50] i dance
[1:41:52] because

[1:42:13] moved but he can't cry
[1:42:16] that's not mature
[1:42:18] that's dead amen
[1:42:20] amen but you know i think i'm getting
[1:42:22] maybe to the age
[1:42:24] you know i know what it's like as a
[1:42:25] young person to
[1:42:27] have an experience with god maybe get a
[1:42:28] little emotional or something and then
[1:42:30] be under the weight of what somebody
[1:42:31] might think or the criticism or
[1:42:32] something but i think i'm getting to be
[1:42:34] a big boy now
[1:42:35] and i'm not worrying so much about what
