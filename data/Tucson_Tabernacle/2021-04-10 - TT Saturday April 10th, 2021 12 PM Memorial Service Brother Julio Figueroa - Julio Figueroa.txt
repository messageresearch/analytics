heads open with prayer and heavenly father we humbly give you thanks for the privilege of knowing your servant and our brother brother julio we thank think that we have been visited by a special life and special works of grace and love lord that our brother was constantly doing and we know lord he's reached the end of his journey a mortal journey but he's made a journey to a new place what we all long for is to get out of this that brother bannon said this pest house and into that eternal body into that place where there's no yesterday no tomorrow no sorrow no growing old we thank you for that lord and today we need you lord we can't just assemble in our own ability our own strength or our own human power to try to comfort one another only you can do that lord we just ask you to comfort the family comfort them be with them all all the extended family and every brother sister who's seriously missing brother julio right now and we just ask you to we know that we can't pray and ask you to fill that void because you want us to yearn to see him again so just comfort us and soothe us lord during this time of separation we ask your blessings on the service let everything be done for your glory and for your honor let your spirit move on hearts today move on every one of us and help us to commit our lives to a deeper consecration to you father we ask you in jesus name and everybody said amen so julio rodriguez figueroa was born march 4th 1948 in tucson here he spent two years in the united states army and from 1968 to 1970 he was married with uh sister silvia gahiola on march 20th 1971 he survived today by silvia la figueroa his wife gabriel grace lillian and stephen his children grandchildren ethan logan nathan family named taylor stitt elena ryan bustamonte and caleb figueroa he worked at tucson electric power keeping the lights on for everybody and making sure the bills got near for 30 years and he retired in december of 1973 excuse me from 1973 to december of 2003 then began a battle for three years against a demon that finally we could say didn't take him but was used by god to take him across into a better place and he passed away march 19th 2021. i don't have a scripture i want to read and just uh one of my thoughts about brother julio that made him special was he was so much like jesus in so many ways so much like the perfect husband the perfect father although you young people may not think that you children and grandchildren because there's that human part that fails to really allow that divinity to really show all the time but by god's grace christ shown through him anyway amen but in the in the scripture here in john chapter 13 it said now before the feast of the passover jesus knew that his hour was come and that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end i think that's the greatest testimony that we could say or the words of a commendation towards brother julio that he was steadfast in his love right to the very last breath we thank god for that so much like jesus himself but the great mystery included in this scripture is that with our lord jesus christ there was an end of his mortal walk but that wasn't the end of him his life goes on and he's the same yesterday today and forever and the same can be said about brother julio there was an end to the moral suffering and the mortal weakness and the frailty but that was only the beginning of the real expression of that man that life that was there we thank god for that so we're looking for him to appear to us i'm going to be looking for we got so many now to be looking forward to come visit us on resurrection morning that uh we don't know which one it will be or maybe a whole group but in our case here because of our love for brother julio we believe god would permit him to just come by our place and let us know that the resurrection is on unless we would happen to pass over into that other dimension before that but either way christians can't lose because of jesus christ he conquered death overcome death hell in the grave broke the seals into eternal life and set us free from sin and death and if anybody here doesn't know the lord jesus christ today i would beg of you consider that you need a savior and a comforter i'll guarantee you though the man who we're celebrating here today he knew that savior and he i'm a better man because i knew brother julio and his all of his family i'm so blessed that one day falling in love with sister mirna i didn't know what i was going to get a lot of wonderful family an extended family that just made me a better man and so god richly bless you and we know that some of you are deeply suffering and may be confused and maybe not understanding but just we're going to pray that the holy spirit will just comfort every heart today give us strength to go on lift our cross keep carrying our cross keep pressing on the battle god richly bless you it is a comfort for a christian to know that we step from this life to the next life and sometimes we wish we were there already so but we have a life to live here and a time to go on and my sister irma shola makes your way up to sing song here brother julio was a meter reader along with quite a few brothers and got to talking about some of the different ones but my brother fred who worked with him for many years said to give you his condolences and he had such good memories of brother julia a wonderful time so god bless you as as our such i don't know if there's plane or not uh channel [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] he knows me [Music] oh [Music] [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] me um [Music] i don't speak to understand but i know [Music] who holds tomorrow [Music] and i know who holds if you'll stand with me as we sing the chorus one more time many things about tomorrow i don't seem to understand [Applause] but i know who holds tomorrow and i know who holds my hand we have brother robert fiorella brother julio's brother to speak and if he'll come now and receive that god bless you may be seated i uh didn't relish the thought of having to do this i mean for my brother and sometimes because i get a little emotional so if i get emotional just bear with me he's my only brother there's only three of us my sister irma we use standard so they can know who you are in case you don't know who you are that's my sister my older sister as brother green would say and uh there was my brother and myself and i'm the baby of the family and i want to just relate a few things about his life and go into a few couple of scriptures and try to be as brief as i can but so many things you want to say so many things you wanted you know you just and you only have so much time but i we were raised in the apostolic church which is a won this uh pentecostal spanish denomination and uh i was until the age of 12 that's when we came into the message and we had the privilege of being here at the old tucson tabernacle back in 1965 in november when brother greene first came and started the first services we were there and but one thing that was on my mind is to say this this morning this morning that afternoon is that my sister had told me that she remembered how that sometimes my brother was was persecuted for for being uh what they called in the old spanish barrio they called us alleluias or holy rulers and and he was and sometimes he would come home with his clothes torn and beat up she said one time they were attending a little lutheran church for school and they came out and and when they were going walking home a group of boys were there to meet him and she and she says he told her run on home and he stayed to meet them and so he he suffered a little bit for that for being a believer and i recall one time myself i was coming home with just a little kid and uh this young boy began to yell at me call me hallelujah and throw rocks at me and remember he hit me in the back of the head and when i put my hand back there there was blood on my hand i ran home crying but that's sometimes it was rough you know growing up in the water one and not being like everybody else but i believe that's part of that uh training that god brings us through and he was he was quite a guy he was a leader of the pack the whole neighborhood had about 10 12 guys that he organized the football games and the baseball games and he had a friend that from all the way from from grade school until they graduated in from high school and they actually worked together in a restaurant for about three or four years the old karachamaka restaurant over on on ajo in mission road mission road and and i and i thought to call him because they had parted ways by the time they they graduated my brother was immediately drafted into the army was during the vietnam war and and he went off to to college which gave him a deferment and they pretty much separated right there and i thought because they were really good friends i thought i'd give him a call but this is his name is raul grijalva he is now a u.s congressman and he's been there for about over 12 over 20 years i think now and so i called his office and it was on a wednesday night when we received a call from sister sylvia that he was he was no longer speaking if we wanted to see him alive go tomorrow she invited us to come to the house so that night wednesday night i called his office and i left the message and it was recording said they will get back to you within 48 hours i was surprised the next morning at 8 o'clock in the morning the phone rang my phone rang and it was it was a a staff member from his office he wanted more information when i told him how they had been worked together for three or four years in high school going through high school from grade school all the way to they graduated we're going to get this message to mr grijalva he said can we call you back at this number and said yes well that same day around noon when i get a call and it was wrong and we grew up together we just three four houses from where i lived i know his mom his sisters you know we just knew each other he just grew up together and i told him he was very thankful for for giving him the call letting him know and i said i know you guys were pretty close he said we were tight we were tight he was the one that bossed us around he tell us what to do and who's going to play what what what what part of the team and where we're going and we're going to play the ballpark over here over there and uh so he was the one that bossed everybody matter of fact when they all graduated he was he loved motorcycles and and he had organized all his friends rent motorcycles and they were going to go into mexico and i think a lot of parents didn't like that idea including hours and they were able to talk him out of it otherwise they would have gone but just things of those things that we remember back back in the day as we're growing up i also remember that when he was in the army uh he had been transferred over from to to fort knox as a tank mechanic and he was given a furlough to come home for a few days and then he was going to report back to fort knox and they were going to ship them off to vietnam and during that time my mother was really sick and he he came and he never told us didn't tell us what was going on but we were praying and he was praying and when he went back to fort knox he had changed his orders and they changed they sent him to germany instead and he finished off his his time there in germany and never went to vietnam but i'm thankful for that and god took care of him but he was he was a good brother we and i he and i we had a great respect for each other and i loved my brother he loved me and we never had problems we did with kids growing up but once we became adults we were we respected each other we had loved one for each one for another and he was one part of the testimony i want to give this this afternoon is back in 1957 my parents uh had a few met medical problems and they heard that brother branham was going to be in phoenix and so they went and it was at the old madison square garden building there in phoenix arizona where brother branham preached many times brother billy paul once told me that his daddy told him that there was a heart at one of the hardest places for him to preach because he they would took about three services to to expel all the spirits that were in the building you see they could see them hanging on from the balconies and uh and so they went that that night it was back in march 3rd 1957 and brother brown preached the message what think he of christ and then that mess and then that they were given a a card with a letter and a number and so they had sat down and my brother was about nine years old and he was laying at the on the floor sleeping and when he was asleep you couldn't wake him up he had a problem with his sleeping he was getting up and every night and sleepwalking with his eyes open and they had to watch him all the time and and so they had that on their heart they wanted him to be prayed for and my mother had a lump on her breast that was very painful and that she wanted to be prayed for and and also my dad worked at the mines and salmon well and he had to use those rubber boots because of the water in the tunnels and caused a skin reaction in his legs and he was bleeding and he had scabs and where he was scratched and so it was pretty bad and so they went with those three things and and they got called and when they're calling their number you know they're in the my brother's laying there on the floor between between the seats and and they're trying to wake him up and they couldn't wake him up they're calling their number finally my dad stands up and he says leave him here god knows our need so they went and got in line and and you're going to hear that what what just said there if you have brothers have that ready okay go ahead and put it on one that should be righteous perverted to do wrong now a lady that's my mother the lady she no i thought she was deaf but she can't speak english you come to interpret for her right speak to her as i speak do you believe on the lord jesus christ do you believe me to be his prophet if god will tell me what you are here for will you receive it now you know that i don't know you i can't even speak your language [Music] but the god of heaven speaks all language you are here wanting me to pray for you for a growth if that is right raise up your hands that growth is on your left breast if that's right wave your hand and this is your husband and you want prayer for him because he's got a skin disease that is right then you won't pray for a son that's my brother and the reason you all pray for him is because he walks in his sleep with his eyes open [Music] does thou believe on the son of god amen now surely that would settle mental telepathy for you when when my dad and mom passed in front of brother brown to go down the other side my dad told me that brother brown pat him on the back he says just believe everything is going to be all right they came home my mother was miraculously healed you know it's different between the difference between a miracle and divine healing divine healing can take time but a miracle is like right now we serve a god of miracles he's the same yesterday today and forever and and as he passed he says everything's gonna be all right and my dad was was healed also they came back giving testimony in tucson to the brothers and sisters and what did god have done you imagine if it being you had been in that prayer line and those things are taking place and um and but you know my brother was not prayed for satan was exposed but he was not prayed over and that that thing needed to be rebuked but god was in charge the next about the next night i believe it was in the wee hours of the morning it was still dark outside my dad says he suddenly woke up and he was totally completely awake and he lays there and and he's thinking maybe i heard a noise he was a very light sleeper and so he waited for a moment or two to see if there's any more noise so he thought he'd get up and go check look around so he put his feet on the floor he's getting up off the off the bed and my brother used to sleep in a cot at the doorway to the kitchen with a bedroom and the kitchen were connected through a doorway and he there was an old folding cot he would lay out there and they had to be watching him right there by that doorway and as my dad is getting up in that that morning my brother he looks up and my brother's getting up in his sleep again and my dad gives a testimony he told me personally he said i i didn't even think what i was gonna say i just i pointed like this and i said satan i rebuke you in the name of the lord jesus christ my brother stopped in mid-air and he fell back on that bed and never got up again that spirit was cast out of him and so that was a testimony of what taking place you know the bible says in hebrews chapter 12 paul writes he says we're foreseen we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses in that time there have been 500 stood there and watched jesus ascend into heaven all these witnesses all the ones that seen the miracles and and they were believing and you know they were dying off and they were in that same thing today many of these that walked with the prophet of our day they're gone the testimonies we have that may be on record but they're gone there's getting to be there's more on that side than there is on this side and and i believe that that you know that's that's where we're at right now and i believe that we've lost another witness amen but you know the record stays amen what was done amen will shatter from the mountaintops god is a healer god is a deliverer amen he's the same yesterday today and forever amen i'd like to just say a few scriptures this afternoon i believe that it's it's fitting because it is a word of god that gives us strength it is a word of god that that gives us that that that which we which we need to comfort our hearts when we need it and and i need this uh it it's hard sometimes for me to think about it but to that i lost my brother and those of you that lost somebody close to you like that you know what i'm talking about you know in psalms 116 and verse 15 but david writes precious in the sight of the lord is the death of his saints amen something precious when when a child of god goes home as we sung about this morning the battle is over hallelujah it's done he's graduated into that eternal place no more suffering no more problems amen in proverbs 14 and 32 it says a wicked is driven away in his wickedness but the righteous hallelujah the righteous hath hope in his death brother brown says that's an escape that's a door called death it is an escape for the believer to leave this old pest house behind and go into the realms of god amen it it's the hope of every believer amen you know job went through a lot then and i can i can relate to job having lost the loved one but job lost all his children in one day can you imagine how he was a man just like you and i he felt the pain the separation he would never see them again in this lifetime and he was hurting inside and and then he was sick and his own wife had told him to curse god and die and and there he is in that condition and and he begins to question and ask questions to himself and i believe when death comes and it hits near us we it causes us to reflect we realize how mortal we are we realize that there's no guarantee for tomorrow i don't care if you're 10 years old or or 80 years or 90 there's no guarantee for tomorrow and there in joel 14 1 he says man that is born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble he cometh forth like a flower and is cut down he fleeth also as a shadow and continueth not in joel 14-5 he says seeing his days are determined they're numbered there's there's a cross in this lifetime he sees seeing his days are determined the number of his months are with thee thou has appointed his bounds and he cannot pass he has numbered our days in 14 and 10 he says but a man but man dieth and wasteth away yay man giveth up the ghost the spirit of life and where is he it's a good question to ask it's a good question for us to ask where is he is there life after death we're told by the intellectual man of today and the scientists and the manner of education that there is no god that there is no life after death that this is all there is in 14 and 14 he says if a man die shall he live again have you ever asked yourself that question if a man dies shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will i wake that he knew he had an appointed time you know we all have an appointed time god knows we don't know that time but he says in my in my appointed time will i wait till my change come he didn't say about a death or a separation or a ceasing to exist but a change what is death it's a change from from the old body that's wore out tired into a new body into a what we call a theophany body there was a sister one time laying in the hospital years ago i remember brother larry garrett showed me the picture of this woman and they had taken a picture of her and when this picture was developed there was a young woman standing next to her she was dying of cancer and she only had a few short days to live and the husband looked at that picture and he said well that's that's my wife when i met her you see that's the offer the body was already standing there waiting jesus said i go to repair a house a mansion he said don't don't let don't be troubled he said don't be afraid he says i go to prepare a place for you that where i am you shall be also it's a house we live in a house amen what you see here is just represents robert figueroa but there's a soul that's eternal that is waiting that that is waiting for the time to be released and to step into a perfect theophility body praise be to god he says in 14 and 15 thou shalt call hallelujah and i will answer thee thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands for now thou numbers my steps does thou not watch over my sin we cannot hide anything from him and all it takes friends is a prayer just a prayer in believing and in insincerity ask god lord would you forgive me my sins lord will you come to live in my life will you come and change me that's all it takes and just hand it over to him take the reigns of your life and say lord here they are lead me and guide me in psalms 39 and 4 david uh man after god's own heart he knew how to please god he always had those the right words that came out of his heart there in 39 and 4 psalms he says lord make me to know mine end and the measure of my days don't let me forget lord that i'm mortal don't let me forget lord that one day i have to cross that door one day i have to meet you one day i'll have to face you amen don't let me forget he says what it is is that that i may know how frail i am behold thou has made my days as a handbreath that's from here to here a hand breath and i like that he uses the hand as a metaphor because if you look at your hand this this afternoon i think most of us have an m written in the palms of our hands from the latin word muerte which means death that is written in the palms of our hands every time we look at our hands let us know that we are also mortal and one day god will call us home but like job said you will call and i will answer amen that's what we want when he calls let us be ready to answer here am i lord here am i he goes on he says behold that has made my days as a handbreadth and my age is as nothing before thee verily every man at his best state is all together vanity surely every man walketh in a plain show surely they are disquieted in vain he heapeth up riches and knoweth not who shall gather them now lord what wait i for my hope is in thee deliver me from all my transgressions make me not the reproach of the foolish solomon said oh they're in the book of ecclesiastes he says everything is his vanity and vexation of spirit there's only one thing that counts it's what we've done for christ i'd like to finish this afternoon before i leave the pulpit and take and just read a little poem titled only one life i believe my brother he lived a quiet life he was not one to attract attention he would sit in the back back there and as soon as service was over he'd get up and he'd walk out i think he parked his car out here somewhere and but that was my brother that's the way we're all different right one from the other some of us like to be in the crowd and and some of us like to just kind of be by ourselves and and that's where my brother was he was just quiet and he just lived a quiet life but he was a he was a good husband and a good provider and a good father and a good grandfather he loved his grandchildren i know he loved you all with all his heart only one life which will soon be passed written by c t stud two little lines i heard one day traveling a long life's busy way bringing conviction to my heart and from my mind would not depart only one life will soon be passed only what's done for christ will last only one life yes only one soon will its fleeting hours be done then in that day my lord to meet and stand before his judgment seat only one life will soon be passed only what's done for christ will last only one life the still small voice gently pleads for a better choice bidding these selfish aims to leave and to god's holy will to cleave only one life will soon be passed only what's done for christ will last only one life a few brief years as job said and as david said even with its burdens hopes and fears each with its clays i must fulfill living for self or in his will only one life will soon be passed only what's done for christ will last when this bright world would tempt me sore when satan would a victory score when self would seek to have its way then help me lord with joy to say only one life will soon be passed only what's done for christ will last give me father a purpose deep enjoy your sorrow thy word to keep faithful and true and whatever the strife pleasing thee in my daily life only one life will soon be passed only what's done for christ will last oh let my love with fervor burn and from the world now let me turn living for thee and thee alone bringing thee pleasure on thy throne only one life till soon be passed only was done for christ with last and then only one life yes only one now let me say thy will be done and when at last i hear the call i know i'll say it was worth it all only one life will soon be passed only what's done for christ will last paul left us a scripture that i love and he told us how that that death is nothing to fear he's certain it was a mystery until that time and in closing this afternoon if i turned it back over he said behold i show you a mystery we should not all sleep but we shall all be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump amen we shall be changed for this corruptable he said must put on incorruptible and this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory he said o death where is thy sting oh grave where is your victory the strength of sin is a law but thanks be unto god who gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ amen my brother has won the victory now it's up to us that are behind him making our way towards that finish line as well to find that victory amen press the course my friend don't give up there's more on the other side now that there is on this side and there and there and they're cheering us on this morning this afternoon they're looking over the banister right now my parents are

blessing to get to be part of that so if anybody would like to speak or say something you're welcome to come up good afternoon my name is and i am the son of efrain and maria on behalf of my family yeah cousins i would like to share with you a little bit about how much your father and husband data meant to me personally i firmly believe that every chance that you get to talk about somebody who was special in your life you should take that chance and you should run with it and that's what i'm gonna do today i have nothing prepared but it's it's here and i'm just gonna have to try and find it it's there and it'll come out the one thing that i will always remember is that these feet that are in these shoes the first time that they ever felt the beauty of grass was at your home it was some grass that my feel would mow and kept looking beautiful we tried so many times in our own home to get that grass bring some here and plant it it just it wasn't right but it was right at the ranch i remember that place i remember it like if it was yesterday the first time that these hands felt the coldness of the snow was on a fitting christmas morning where we went and spent it at your house it was the first time that i've ever witnessed the white christmas i'm a native to sonan the places that i grew up i couldn't run on the grass with no shoes on those a little bit too many thorns there but not at your home it will be something that i always always remember i was very very upset with myself because i didn't go see my theo the day before he passed away but i was very very happy to see him laying resting in peace the way that i will always remember him he was a man of peace and you could see it in this in this video collage he wasn't just a man of peace he was a joyous man of peace his smile radiated he was kind of goofy it was very very interesting to try to figure him out every time that i spoke with him i knew that the conversation would be of substance and it would be filled with love and compassion the last conversation that i had with him that i know that i'll remember was sitting in the backyard of his home now the north side of tucson we were talking about the different things talk to me a lot about the rain harvesting the rain harvesting system that he was so delicately putting together it was a thing to marvel we all know that last year 2020 was the driest year of tucson didn't rain very much it rained very very little but the last time that i saw my deal not only was he resting in peace we had just had a large rain and those water harvesting barrels were filled with water i love you guys thank you well i'm very was very thankful to have two wonderful brother-in-laws and uh i know brother branham preached god in simplicity and i believe that they simply believed in god man i believe my father-in-law and my wife and my brother-in-law they believe in this simple gospel and i see how the spirit of god follows that god is in simplicity a lot of times we put him up too far we want to be too intellectual and he's really in simplicity we don't understand why some things have to happen but god knows and i'm thankful for one thing that we know him and the many discussions that i had with uh julio he always wanted to be closer to god and many times i'd get together with bob and my father-in-law and uh julio and we talk about the lord it was always this desire to be closer to god and we work together building our houses out where we live now and we spent a lot of time working on those things but i think that what stands out to me about this life is simplicity and how god is blesses simplicity we want to be too great we just need to be simple and believe god and i know my father-in-law a great believer and he testified to a lot of people and with great results and i had his uh uncle fred uh peter roy he was also a great blessing [Music] i thought maybe i could sing a song but i think i'm a little bit too emotional to do it see i'll try it if i can't do it i'll just sit down have you ever played he'll understand and say well done well i'll just sing an acapella if she can't play it when if you give the best of your service telling the world that a savior is come be not dismayed when men don't believe you he'll understand he'll say well done oh when i come to the end of my journey the way of life and the battle is one carrying the staff of the cross of redemption he'll understand [Music] misunderstood the savior of sinners on the cross he was god's only son oh hear him call his father [Music] yes when this light of labor is ended and the reward of the race you have run oh take us we rest prepared for the faithful will be his best and far and hope well done oh when i come to the end of my journey we're live and [Music] of redemption he'll understand and say well done but if you try and fail in your trying hands for and scored from the work you've begun take up your cross run quickly to meet him he'll understand he'll say well [Applause] i was very uh grateful to be there the day before he passed and they're all there singing hymns and praying and just lovely to be there with the whole family and just have that moment there and i always uh one thing i'll remember about theo was his humor his laugh it's a figaro humor it's kind of a guy thing just to figure out guys my dad's kind of the same way we're all kind of goofy thought that was kind of goofy too i remember uh him and theo david doing the remodeling at our old house on the south side there they were always playing jokes on each other and just theo's always used to wear those big sunglasses that covered like the whole front of your face kind of thing but uh yeah just you know thinking of listening to the part there in the tape thinking how how sweeter heaven is now what we got so many that have passed and i thought that my nana now theo and just so thankful for for the memories i had with him and i pray that the lord comforts each and every one of you and i know just by watching that slideshow when witnessing what i did being around that he loved each and every one of you and the grandkids and it's just we'll miss him but we've got something to look forward to i was the last time i saw lily i was trying to explain to her how i how i remember things and how the memory my memories and to describe it to her how it is and i described it to her that in my in my case i i see a spiral a spiral steps i see spiral steps they're all all the steps are golden and i can go down year after year every step is a year and i can go down all the way down and i was trying to explain to her the first day that i saw julio come into the front yard he came in a motorcycle we lived in on west ohio and i thought well wait a minute oh oh it's sylvia um i was only about 15 16. and uh that's how the figure was came in through our lives that's that was the start it's been a wonderful it's been a wonderful memory uh i can go down like i can say on many years and uh but i won't go up until it's time and if i go up and step up over the stairs i know i'm gonna see him and i'm gonna see a lot of those a lot of those that i have seen in this lifetime it's wonderful don't miss it know the lord jesus christ just just know the lord jesus christ in your life with this young man this young girls i can witness to that into his life god bless you i'm joel pacettely uh i'd have to say julio is probably my favorite deal i like going to see him i just have a few memories no real pep talk because we have to grieve and remember them as they were anyway i remember going with thea when he'd get off work to get something to feed him and he'd be in his tp shirt with the glasses the dark glasses and it was uh either burger king or pat's chili dogs on irvington remember and she'd be so she'd get something to eat for him every day because no right when he's getting off that was everything i remember because we were hardly in tucson we'd be traveling around the country all the time but that was one thing i remember of him in his tep shirt and then his motorcycle when i was really young he'd be on that motorcycle and he was so cool that's how i remember him hey once uh i used to go to school here when i was younger and uh my uncle ted gave me a big little knife he got from africa and uh it was pretty cool so i brought it to school for show-and-tell and uh i got paddled of course and uh brother simrock came out and he's like look at your boy brought and i was like man i'm gonna get home and i'm gonna get it i was like this is gonna be bad and on the right home he goes hey here's your knife back don't be bringing it to the school anymore it's just he just had a way to be common he's a good dad i'll just share a few things um the things i remember the most is he was always snapping gum he could snap gum like nobody else i've ever heard always had gum his mouth and he could whistle like nobody else he was a really good whistler i always loved to hear him whistle his song and i definitely remember the whoppers he would pick us up from school sometimes at the end of the day and he'd take us over to that nana's house and he would always stop at burger king and pick up some whoppers so we could eat whoppers at that house but um kind of miss him i'm sorry i didn't get to see him before he passed but i definitely loved him the goofiness definitely runs in the family let's figure they're so goofy but um a lot of really good memories i have lots of memories of my dad but one memory that always sticks out yes you know during those teenage years you're a little more rebellious and you get a little more fights with your dad and my dad was men of little words you know but i have memories of him and i haven't fight about something i don't really remember what it was and he wouldn't say anything and i would go in my room but the next morning i would always wake up and i would open the door and there would always be a package of gum at my door or a bottle of snapple and that was his way to apologize for what we were talking about or how we were mad at each other those are those are funny memories that that's the way he would talk sometimes you know man of little words but those little tiny things he used to do for us i just think back and i just love those ways he had about himself so packages of gold and snapple at the door means that he was sorry but yeah those are those memories that and we have lots of memories you know we love him we're going to miss him life is going to be so different without him only god can pull us through thank you guys all for coming those are precious memories precious things to remember to have parents that love the lord jesus and raised you up that way i i tell a story when i was young we would go down the street to a friend's house because they had a tv and we wanted to watch cartoons and we didn't have one at our house but they always wanted to be at our house so one day i convinced him to let us go to your house and me and my younger brother and we're watching cartoons and then little steve the youngest brother began to scream and yell and run out and i was with his older brother eddie he was my friend and he says let's go let's go and we took off running and didn't know why because mom and daddy didn't get along and they begin to fight and he says that's why i never want you at my house and i want to be at your house because that never happens at your house what a joy what a blessing it is to have christian parents that love you what a memory to have and how grateful we ought to be so i'm going to do something that's not on the program right now but i just failed to do it all those that are related are part of the family
