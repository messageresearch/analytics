Christ come forth Grant it Lord not for me but for your people I thank you in Jesus precious name amen before we're seated and if I can remember which button to press let's read from Acts chapter 16 starting at verse 9 a vision appeared to Paul in the night there stood a man of Macedonia and prayed him asked him pleaded with him saying come over into Macedonia help us and after he had seen the vision immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia assuredly Gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them please be seated the uh the little coins that are up in the corner there I remembered at this time this gigantic thing that you can see so clearly about the size of a penny is actually a coin that was minted in Philippi and Macedonia between 31 BC and 14 ad so this coin was in circulation at the time of Jesus this physical coin was in the circulation in this city in this town at the time of the events that we're reading about and I better put it in my pocket or I'll leave it up here and who knows what'll happen right well you may recall last November that we read these verses we discussed the vision we discussed Paul's reaction to it we discussed Paul's subsequent persecution our takeaways that evening were from the letter to the Philippians that first we should have joy the joy of the Lord regardless of our circumstances second we need to have Unity we need to make peace with each other third we can disagree but we don't need to be disagreeable fourth we receive practical advice on how to avoid conflict how to keep our hearts and Minds clean and pure before God remember whatsoever things are good righteous pure think on these things and de December we delved into jesus' presence in the temple in the winter to celebrate its rededication under the macbes an extra biblical event that's still celebrated in our day is Hanukah our takeaways that evening were that we are the Temple of the Holy Spirit the temple of God in this day and that uh we need to rededicate our lives to Christ well during our quarantine Heather and I engaged in some further study of the rise of Alexander the Great the maban revolt and helenismo over into Macedonia and help us after he'd seen the vision immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia assur ly Gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them now they were already packed and ready they'd been trying to go to different places in Asia and Fergie and so forth and the Lord just kept stopping them but now he's giving them a vision he's giving them orders to carry the gospel to Macedonia now this had been the kingdom of Alexander's father a fellow named Philip II not going to get too deep in the history but to give you a little background here Philip's forces conquered the last free army of Greece in 338 BC when did Greece regain its independence that was from the Turks in 1829 2200 years later Philips Macedonian army that conquered Greece at the Battle of Kenia was led these guys had a kind of a wed shaped uh formation and on the right on the right flank was Philip the king of Macedonia and commanding the Left Flank was a 16-year-old Alexander I bring this up because when Paul received this Vision he was in effect being asked to go into the belly of the Beast the source of the military might that swept over the entire near in Middle East only 400 years prior the culture and language and religion that dominated life in those reasion in Paul's day Rome after all adopted Greek religion and much of its culture and while Latin may have been the official language of Rome the New Testament was written in Greek until Augustus declared himself Caesar emperor and claimed to be descended from the gods Rome was a republic again reflecting Greek influence did I say Paul was asked to go to Macedonia perhaps commanded as a better term and notice Paul and his company they didn't hesitate they didn't argue they didn't say why there the Bible tells us they immediately endeavored to go into Macedonia they had complete assurance that the gospel was to go there next and isn't it interesting that they proceeded directly to Philippi a Roman Colony within Macedonia and they didn't stop until they got there now back in November we went into some depth about Paul's experience in Philippi not just Paul of course but Silas and Luke and Timothy and Lydia and the Jailer and the vision God was sending them to suffering and persecution some years later when Paul wrote to the Philippians he was again under arrest this time in Rome Luke tells us in Acts 28 and when we came to Rome the Centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the Guard but Paul apparently unlike the other prisoners was suffered was allowed to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him we talked a bit about this uh ankle monitor of antiquity and how the gospel was spread through this means into the very Palace of Caesar and the last verses of the book of Acts ends with this Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house and received all that came in unto him preaching the kingdom of God teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ Christ with all confidence no man forbidding him do you find that curious here's this guy a prisoner Shipwrecked everything lost but the lives of the passengers and crew they find they make the way to Rome and Paul's handed over to the guards so he grabs his ey stone or maybe it was a Droid or something it's a good thing it was waterproof shipwreck proof and Fireproof snake proof he opens a web browser and he goes to VRBO or maybe Airbnb and he locates a convenient Villa nearby swipes his Roman Express Platinum Card rents it for a couple of years right no no somebody shaking their head no no how is he able to rent a house a villa for two years and what had to be one of the highest rent places in the entire mediter Anan World Rome walking distance to Caesar's Palace location location location and it was big enough that he could receive visitors and big enough that he could preach not just witness to the guards but preach and teach how was he able to do this he tells us in Philippians well let's backtrack just a little bit to set the stage back to Macedonia back to the time that he and his group were sent there by that Vision Paul will reveal an important detail that uh Luke neglected to mention in Acts 16 now this is when Paul's released from the prison after the uh Jailer and his family have been converted and baptized and and they Paul and Silas went out of the prison and entered into the house of Lydia and when they had seen the Brethren they comforted them and departed so Luke informs us that Paul and Silas comforted The Fellowship of new Believers but he doesn't tell us what the new Fellowship in Philippi did for them so Paul tells us in simple terms they supported him they gave him money to help him go about his missionary work of sharing the gospel let's read now from Philippians chapter 1 I thank my God upon every remembrance of you always and every prayer of mine for you all making requests with joy for your fellowship or partnership in the gospel from the first day until now being confident of this very thing that he which ha begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ Christ even as it is meat means proper appropriate correct for me to think this of you all because I have you in my heart in as much as both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Gospel ye all are partakers or partners of my grace other translations say you share with me the special favor the grace of God Paul's thanking them he recognizing them for their financial support now this isn't some Greek word thing partnering is a common metaphor we still use today well let's Jump Ahead to the end of this letter to the Philippians chapter 4:1 I rejoiced in the Lord greatly Paul says that now at the last your care of me has flourished again wherein you were also careful but you lacked opportunity in other words you're again taking care of me as you always have when you had the opportunity to do so not that I speak with respect of want no I've learned in whatsoever State I am therewith to be content I know both how to be abased now that's having very little it's not abused and I know how to abound everywhere and in all things I instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need I can do all all things through Christ which strengtheneth me notwithstanding you have well done that you did communicate with my Affliction even though I could have managed without your communication you did the right thing verse 14 in the NIV we have up there yet it was good of you to share in my troubles I know how to be in need and how to have plenty these are physical things he's contrasting with spiritual his contentment his fullness his abundance is in the spiritual side the joy of the Lord is his strength through all these ups and downs of Life the hunger abasement need those are physical he depends on Christ to give him the strength to Bear them and now he makes it very clear how they were expressing their concern how they were communicating how they shared in his troubles he fills in what Luke left out in Acts 16 as they departed from Philippi again we're going to read starting in the King James now you Philippians know also that in the beginning of the Gospel that is when I first came to you with the good news when I departed from Macedonia no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving nobody else was supporting my Ministry at that that time I was flat broke but ye only for even in thessalonica you sent once and again unto my necessity my next stop after I left you and shared the gospel with the lost and dying you sent money and I really needed it Paul uses the word necessity well let's look at it in the New Living Translation as you know you Philippians were the only ones who gave me financial help when I first brought you the good news and then traveled on from Macedonia no other Church did this thank you Lydia and undoubtedly thank you to the Jailer even when I was in thessalonica you sent help more than once well back to the King James not because I desire a gift but I desire fruit that may abound to your account you will receive credit for the successful work in thessalonica because you supported me as I went forth with the gospel but I have all and abound I'm full having received ofus the things which were sent from you and listen to this an odor of a sweet smell a sacrifice acceptable well pleasing to God did you catch that Paul says that God accepts this giving in the same way that he accepted the carefully spelled out sacrifices of days gone by it's worship and it's ministering to God that was the priest's role in the Old Testament tab tacle and Temple in Exodus we read Thou shalt burn the whole Ram upon the altar offering the sacrifice it's a burnt offering unto the Lord it is a sweet Savor there's that word again an offering made by fire unto the Lord and in Leviticus this is the portion of the anointing of Aaron and of the anointing of his sons out of the offerings of the Lord made by fire and the day when he presented them to minister unto the Lord in the priest's office notice the sweet Savor of the sacrifice is through the office of the priest ministering to the Lord not to the congregation to the Lord on behalf of the congregation and that is exactly how Paul tells us the Lord God views the support by the Philippian Church to Paul's Ministry and bringing the gospel to those who have never heard a sweet smelling sa ministering to God back to Philippians but my God shall supply all your need according to his riches and Glory by Christ Jesus now unto God and our father be glory forever and ever amen suddenly verse 19 makes sense Paul's acknowledging their financial support and is reassuring them that God will supply their financial needs in turn this isn't about supporting the local church that's an entirely different topic Paul's talking about supporting those who carry the gospel to others the missionaries who go out into the field to bring others to Christ excuse me I I hear all too often about America turning away the gospel in 1956 excuse me is there anyone present tonight who received Jesus Christ as your personal savior in 1957 or later I'd like to see your hands yeah uhhuh my my hands raised too frankly personal observation I think this is often used as an excuse to look inward Ward instead of reaching outward to withdraw instead of engaging because we're now at a stage of gleaning rather than reaping lot of effort not a lot to show for it when Heather and I were coming back on our last road trip we went through some fields of cotton that the big harvesting machines had gone through and pretty well cleaned the fields but there was still cotton in the fields there were still little bits here and there now if cotton was worth $1,000 an ounce there wouldn't have been any laying in those fields what is a soul worth what is a soul worth but you know what you might gain if you glean Ruth got Boaz oh it's hard brother Lyle people just don't want to hear yeah you mean rejection ridicule treating that perhaps is persecution well this is the last topic that I want to cover tonight in our little overview of Philippians persecution Paul makes it clear that persecution suffering on behalf of Christ is part and parcel of being a Christian and even more let's be honest most of what we call persecution for our faith here in the United States is actually rejection social isolation being teased or becoming the brunt of some unkind remarks a few years ago I read two books I think I shared a bit from one of them with you the the books are titled the insanity of God and the insanity of obedience both were written by a Baptist missionary fellow by the name of Nick Ripken in the first book the insanity of God he details his conversion becoming a missionary he wanted to be a veterinarian and ended up in Somalia and the Despair and pain of that time in the Horn of Africa in service to the Lord Death of his child murder of those who had come to Christ he tells of bounties openly advertised in the madisha newspaper for killing Christian converts the editor of the paper wrote in response to a question from a radical Muslim why not just kill the westerners it's a response killing westerners might turn them into Martyrs so it's not coste effective to kill Western Christians whose deaths might possibly Inspire additional committed Believers to come to our country and take up each martyr's mantle if however we kill their converts the Western Christians will be afraid and they will go home these Western Christians will not be able to watch their converts be killed when their converts are killed the Western Christians will leave sadly that's largely what happened persecution in the late 20th and into the early 21st century in the second book the insanity of obedience he details some of the experiences of Christians being persecuted for their faith in many places from Africa to Russia to China he makes it very clear that when we commit to following Christ we do so on his terms not ours I can't help but think of my wife as an eight-year-old girl riding in a full Land Rover in Cuba that's my sweetie right there holding her dolly don't look at that loud they were coming home from an evening service of bringing Jesus to a small V Village suddenly attacked coming under Fire her father taking three bullets to his head while the vehicle is riddled with dozens of hits from automatic weapons fire missionaries persecuted for the cause of Christ bringing hope and salvation to the lost in Philippians Paul elevates this thought suffering is not fatalistic acceptance of persecution let's read Philippians 1:29 For unto you it is given these are more gifts of the Spirit given in behalf of Christ not only to believe on him the gift of faith but also to suffer for his sake oops that's not one we often list or pray for is it anyone come up here for prayer lately asking uh why you're not suffering more for the sake of the Gospel having the same conflict which he saw in me and now here to be in me we know that Faith the ability to accept and believe is a gift from God but so is suffering so is persecution are we as fervent in our desire let alone acceptance of suffering for our witness as we are of Faith to believe let's read this in the NIV The New International Version it uses the term Grant in our day what is a grant a grants a response to a request for resources to accomplish something perhaps research or product development or something for it has been granted to you we we've examined your application we're happy to inform you that your application has been accepted we are pleased to award you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him but also to suffer for him since you're going through the same struggle you saw I had and now he that I still have the New Living Translation makes it even clearer it's not only a gift or a grant look at the terms used here you have been given not only the privilege of trusting in Christ Faith but also the privilege of suffering ing for him we are in this struggle together you have seen my struggle in the past and you know that I'm still in the midst of it suffering and persecution go hand in hand with God's acceptance of your faith it's a privilege I like that the NLT says we're in this together and this isn't a one-time deal it's not you go through the test check the box off and go to the next you don't get through it get over it put it behind you look back on it no no Paul indicates that here at the end of his life he is still suffering and still struggling just as when he was in jail with Silas singing hymns and praises to God in the midst of horrific physical torture God sent them on the strength of a Crystal Clear Vision to persecution and suffering Paul underscores this as a promise in his last letter to Timothy second Timothy chapter 3:10 but thou Timothy has fully known because you were with me in much of what I am now going to list you stood with me and experiened the same alongside me you have fully known my Doctrine manner of life purpose Faith longsuffering charity patience persecutions of afflictions which came unto me at Antioch at Iconium at lra what persecutions I endured Paul's joying the Lord was in spite of these persecutions but out of them all the Lord delivered me yay and all that will live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution that's both a prophecy and a promise if you live a Godly manner of Life In Christ we sometimes sing every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line persecution and suffering are Promises of God to all believers is this what you have in mind when you sing this song it's not what I tend to have in mind when I sing it or pray and claim the promises this isn't one that we often reach out for is it but but look Jesus made this pretty clear when he sent the 12 to preach the good news in Israel in Matthew 10 he gave them some instruction and it's pretty clear that these weren't limited to them or to them starting at verse 16 behold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves what do wolves do when they see sheep especially if they're a little hungry not not the Sheep but the wolves are a little hungry bye-bye sheep yum tasty snack yeah look what else he says in that same speech that same uh area of Matthew 10 the brother shall deliver up the brother to death and the Father the child and the children should rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to death put to death this isn't a social media thing it's not a not enough likes on Facebook or some nasty tweet prison death persecution from within your very family as a kid I heard about this sort of thing in the Soviet Union and he goes on to say you shall be hated this is strong language not passively being ignored or put down but actively hated makes me think of our country today where all sorts of actions are now classified as hate crimes and prosecuted at the federal level who knows this could be coming our way you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but he that endureth to the end shall be saved hated of all for Jesus name's sake for standing firm on the basic principles of Christianity that my friends is a promise just like he that believes and is baptized shall be saved hate that ultimately requires endurance this isn't a 40 meter or a 50 yard dash it's a marathon endurance and applies over a length of time not just a brief moment how is Jesus treated couple of more verses down the disciple the student is not above his master his teacher nor the servant above his lord it's enough for the disciple that he be as his master and the servant as his Lord if they have called The Master of the House elub in Hebrew that's alvu means the Lord of the Flies how much more shall they call them of his household wait a minute brother Lyall aren't we told right here in Philippians 4:7 the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus yeah yeah that's what we spoke about last November the peace of God the joy of the Lord but that's a spiritual blessing Jesus said a little further down in the same chapter of Matthew 10 think not that I am come to send peace on Earth I came not to send peace but a sword now this season of the year December typically we we hear instead Luke 2 suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the Heavenly Host praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace Good Will toward men you can have peace in your heart while on Earth General Peace On Earth Is Yet To Come Good Will toward men yeah excuse me remember what Jesus said when he was asked about Good Will toward men Master what is the great commandment in the law Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets Mark records it this way Jesus answered him the first of all the Commandments is here o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind with all thy strength this is the first commandment and the second is like namely this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself there's none other commandment greater than these and Jesus asked when challenged it another time who is Thy Neighbor I ask us all tonight who is our neighbor oh wait a minute brother L we're talking about persecution about suffering for the gospel yeah yeah that's right this is a photo of the church I attended from age three to age six it it's located in San Jose California it's called Grace Baptist Church this image was probably taken near the time our family attended in the early in mid 1950s yeah I'm an old guy I remember seeing my brother no being baptized here asking my parents what did what is that all about I I was five or six at the time so Noah would have been 10 or 11 I remember going up those steps into that church quite well the church is located in the downtown area next to San Jose State University now malls didn't exist then there were no big box stores there was no online shopping I suspect that Jeff Bezos hadn't been born yet everyone went to the downtown area to shop today San Jose is over a million Souls when we moved there in 1953 it was barely 50,000 in the early 1950s this was a nice area of town today not so much it's filled with desperate homeless most people saturated with drug abuse hopelessness plenty of petty and not so petty crime but the church hasn't closed its doors the congregation hasn't sought a nicer location they're serving the community of which they're a part tragedy stuck there several weeks ago in mid November a homeless man was being served a meal he attacked those who were helping him two killed three more hospitalized what were they doing we read in James what does it profit my brothers though a man say he hath faith and have not works can that kind of Faith save him if a brother or sister be naked or destitute of daily food and one of you say to them departed peace be warmed and filled notwithstanding you don't give them the things that they need what is it profit what's the use even so faith if it doesn't have works is dead being alone in case you didn't get it the Lord repeats this through James just a few more verses down as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead uh these are just Christians loving their neighbors Good Will toward men oh but but brother L James is speaking about our brothers and sisters in the faith isn't he not not the World At Large we we often remind ourselves from John 13 a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I've loved you that you also love one another but by this shall all men know that you're my disciples if you have love one to another well this love he's talking about here is pretty intense it led Jesus to the Cross we claim to love each other take care of each other do we do we really having love one to another but Jesus also tells us in Luke 6 as you would that men should do to you do ye also to them likewise not just your brothers and sisters The World At Large if you love them which love you what than have you the Sinners also love those that love them if you do good to them which do good to you what thank have ye Sinners also do even the same if he lend to them of whom you hope to receive what thank have you Sinners also lend to Sinners and receive as much again but here's a commandment but love ye your enemies what do you think of what I think of Jesus on the cross father forgive them did he mean it were they forgiven Stephen being stoned lay not this sin to their charge love you your enemies do good and lend hoping for nothing again and your reward shall be great ye shall be the children of the highest for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil does that describe us does that describe me do I have that trait in my spiritual DNA from my heavenly father be ye therefore merci merciful as your father also is merciful and don't we desire God's mercy not as judgment do we really truly love our enemies are we kind to the unthankful what about to the evil our love for each other should be unique at a higher level mirroring Jesus committed love to us but we're also commanded it's required it's not an option or only if we feel like it to love those outside our fellowship outside our faith specifically including our enemies genuine love unfeigned heartfelt love here's what Jesus said about those Folks at Grace Baptist Church then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when saw we thee hungry and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee and the King shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto you in as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me you don't know who Jesus is veiled in or what their state of relationship is with him the people of this church were attacked they were persecuted right here in 21st century America two dead three hospitalized just for being a good neighbor trying to let their light shine in spite of the Danger trying to share the love of Jesus with the less fortunate I have to ask myself Lyall how's my spiritual Investment Portfolio doing right now is it paying dividends or is it just focused on value growth Doctrine avoiding dividends avoiding witnessing how's your spiritual Investment Portfolio I'm preaching now maybe I'm meddling I'm preaching to Lyle Johnson even if I'm not raising my voice even if I still have my coat still on this is hard am I taking up my cross or am I avoiding it brother green often referred to persecution as spiritual dividends Mark 10 Jesus answered and said verily I say unto you there's no man that has left house or Brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospels but he shall receive a h hundredfold now in this time houses and Brethren sisters mothers children lands with persecutions and in the world to come eternal life the more we give up for the Lord the more will be persecuted are we excited by this do we shout Amen to this promise no no no neither do I but it's still part and parcel of our faith so how does this work what why is this a good thing how is this a privilege that were granted this isn't again referring to peer pressure Facebook or anything but brother Lyle doesn't persecution mean we failed somehow why does God let me suffer why does he withhold healing from me why am I still in pain or let's be very clear suffering is not a discredit to the gospel or to the power of God it's an opportunity to partner with God God to display the power of the Gospel there's more impact to singing praises in our pain than singing praises having never experienced pain our witness is not how well we might Tiptoe Through the Tulips it must show our character or lack of character back to Philippians wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not as in my present only but much more so in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling other translations read work hard to show the results of your salvation this isn't coasting downhill it's work requires effort for it is God which worketh he's not coasting either he's putting forth effort too it's God working in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure remember it's all about him it's not about us he's the Potter we're the clay we're in his hands to do as he pleases Thou Art Worthy Thou Art Worthy for thou has created all things for your pleasure right right we read in Revelation if he's the Potter and we the clay maybe he's fashioning a beautiful vase or maybe he's making a chamber pot it's his choice it's not yours it's not mine do all things without murmurings and disputings why that she may be blameless and harmless the sons the children of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation welcome to Leota our first stop is Arizona USA among whom you shine as lights in the world my mother-in-law often sang a song her version of the song at any rate something like this I I I can't do it quite with her pitch but it was brighten the corner where you are brighten the corner where you are someone far from Harbor May behold the light afar brighten the corner where you are which she did for most of her 99 years again Jesus put it this way let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven how do you let your light shine many ways of course but the one that Paul is emphasizing to the Philippians and therefore to us is to rejoice in the midst of personal suffering and loss let's read on holding forth the word of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain neither labored in vain Paul's depending on the church at Philippi to hold their testimony in the face of internal and external pressures so Paul can hold on to his my brothers my sisters we are each one of us in this together each of us affects the other hold fast yay and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith I joy and rejoice with you all for the same cause also do ye joy and rejoice with me as the musicians return we'll close with this thought then stated so eloquently and consistently by Paul we're in this together so let's learn to rejoice in spite of and in the midst of suffering and rejection learn to stick together to hold fast to the Hope which lies within us reaching out to others and supporting one another in prayer and fellowship not being slack supporting those who are bringing the gospel to the lost and the dying they're still out there you know we're still here therefore there are still some that must hear the good good news and come to relationship with Jesus Christ we must die to ourselves every day that we draw breath continue the struggle as Paul so clearly reminded us it's one thing to die for him it's quite another to live for him I wonder if we can sing and I don't claim that I can but together I'd like us to try anyway to sing I pledge allegiance to the lamb starting starting at the chorus there we go I pledge alance to the Lamb with all my strength with all I am I will seek to want honor his commands I pledge a to the lamb I have heard how Christians long ago were brought before a tyrant Throne they were told that he would spare their light if they would renounce the name of Christ but one by one they chose to Die the Son of God they would not be deny like a great Angelic CH sings I can almost hear their voes ring I pledge alance to the Lamb with all my strength with all our I am I will seek to honor his commands I pledge alance to the land now years have come and the years have gone and the cause of Jesus still goes on now our time has come to count the cost to reject this world to embrace the cross and one by one let us live our lives for the one who died to give give us life till the trumpet sounds on the final day let us proudly stand and boldly say I pledge alance to the Lamb with all my strength with all I am I will seek to honor his commands I pledge alance to the lamb to the Lamb of God Who Bore my pain who took my place who wor my shame I will seek to honor his commands I pledge alance to the lamb I pledge alance to the Lamb with all my strength with all I I am I will seek to horor Let's stand yes I pledge alance to the with all my strength with all I have I will seek to H [Music] his I pledge alance to the when you Pledge Your Allegiance to something you're giving your all when they would pledge their allegiance to the king or if you were in the military and you had a commanding officer and you pledged to to do what they said you put your life in their hands but they also put their life in your hands because this was part of you see when you Pledge Your Allegiance to the king of kings and Lord of lords he walked this way already he was persecuted he was hated he was hung on a cross he shed his blood for you and me he doesn't ask me to shed my blood to save myself because he did that already but he asked for a willingness of heart to say whatever it takes Lord that's what I'll be willing to do if it means the joy of God's salvation that I have shared that I have got to know to give it to someone else then I'd be willing to give my life for someone else to have that you know and sometimes as as brother Lyall was speaking I I find myself a bit embarrassed for some of my actions when he said not my will but thy will be done Lord and I'm saying Lord can we modify the will a little bit sometimes can we find an easier way to go but let us hold fast let us say Lord one more time maybe maybe we just bow our heads in you in your own way just tell the Lord One More Time Lord whatever it takes Lord I'll be willing to do Lord I I want to surrender my will my thoughts my ideas my being everything Lord to you first to you Lord that the joy of the Lord the peace of God that I've got to sh know and have and the the confidence and and the reassurance of God in my life could be given to others also Lord a hope like that Thief there at the cross who turned and looked at you at the last second and said father remember God remember me when you come into your kingdom and you didn't turn against him you didn't say because of you I'm up here too but you looked at him and say this day be with me in Paradise Lord may we have that same attitude Lord whatever it takes that someone else may get to know you and to love you and share the life of Jesus Christ is our prayer Lord help us to be willing to say yes Lord in Jesus name amen though the ship is battered it'll still make it through the storm though life seems hard and the waves come and your life seems to be upside down and nobody is he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll be with you see the gospel covers it all covers it all and every part of it even the humanity the the the the faults and the failures of of humans like you and me are written down in the scriptures it's not just perfect Christians it's people like you and me who said yes Lord and he would use us so love him for that thank you brother Lyall some of those that's that's hard to preach yes that's hard to preach because you have to look at yourself very closely doing this so amen just a couple of announcements before we go brother Matt got a chance to speak with him he if you tried contacting him on the phone or anything the last few days there was a a severing of a in some construction or they were doing in they separate quite a few of the lines and Verizon was affected he could not make take any incoming or outgoing phone calls for two days and today we were able to talk so Lord willing brother Matt will be here this weekend and uh coming in I believe he said on Friday through Monday Monday is brother Matt's birthday so if you'd like to maybe get him a card or something like that that would be nice it would be nice to show our appreciation so uh he's a young man 37 38 years old so um I told him I said I thought you told me you were 36 So you you're turning 37 he goes I thought I was 37 turning 38 and he goes but I'll take yours better so but you know one of these days it'll be worth it all through it all I've learned to trust in Jesus through it all I've learned to trust in God so the Lord be with you and and when things seem to be going backwards just say Lord thank you because you're still in charge of this and he watches over us he keeps I had a testimony from his sister today she was driving down on her way to work and a car blew out a tire the tire came off completely and there was a semi TR right in front of her and the traffic was packed and she saw the tire come off go underneath the truck and she say I had nowhere to go that tire was going to hit me dead on it jumped up in the back of a semi- Traders they have that um that that bar that comes down kind of a block and the tire hung right up on that and allowed her to slow down and back off and then the tire fell off and went sideways and she said I just have to praise the Lord because no matter what the situation he doesn't leave us so when things look hard things look different you might you know I remember my dad telling me when when his family became a Christian in the 40s and the 50s his grandfather my great-grandfather was a bootlegger they they ran alcohol and all of that and the Lord got a hold of his life and changed him completely he became a street corner preacher my dad said he was about 13 14 years old and my great grandpa would be preaching and they'd come and throw things at him spit at him and everything and my dad wanted to fight every one of them and Great Grandpa would lean his hand on his shoulder and say leave him alone son this is for the Gospel of Jesus Christ see that's what God does in your heart for you you say Lord my neighbor my neighbor mean my but maybe they could have a chance also so let's keep that attitude always and at times when things get hard just say thank you Lord that you've I've been counted worthy to suffer for you amen through it all I've learned to trust in Jesus through it all [Music] through it all through it all i' learn trust in Jesus I've learn to trust in God through it all through it all oh I Le to upon his
