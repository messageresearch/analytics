[14:55] God help us to get ourselves out of the
[14:57] way this morning Lord
[14:59] just be completely totally surrendered
[15:02] and yielded to you Lord Jesus we ask
[15:05] these things the precious lovely name of
[15:07] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen
[15:10] amen before we dismiss the children to
[15:13] the to their Sunday schools just got a
[15:17] couple
[15:18] announcements after service Brothers
[15:21] have asked that we just let all the
[15:24] parents and the children know not to
[15:27] play in the fellowship hall there's
[15:29] things that can poke and fall and get
[15:32] hurt so it might be best that the
[15:35] children just go outside and may we'll
[15:36] try to have the youth rooms open
[15:38] downstairs that the kids can play there
[15:40] as well let's just try to keep the plane
[15:42] minimal in the fellowship hall and um
[15:45] starting also on Wednesday night the
[15:47] fellowship hall is going to be closed
[15:49] and sealed off for some uh removal of
[15:52] some flooring materials and we just want
[15:55] to keep the dust all contained in there
[15:57] so all the doors are going to be sealed
[15:59] and so we're just going to ask everyone
[16:00] to go around to the front door our
[16:03] family did that this morning my Lydia
[16:06] was protesting a little bit she was
[16:09] worried about the homeless people and I
[16:11] said well I like what brother Daniel's
[16:13] saying he he we were here Friday night
[16:15] and we were upstairs in the youth room
[16:16] and we were practicing some songs and he
[16:18] says I'm going to go out in front and
[16:19] see if I got a captive audience and he
[16:21] goes out there and just starts preaching
[16:22] to them and talking to them and I think
[16:24] that's a a good attitude to have that
[16:27] you know maybe you're not brave enough
[16:29] to go engage with them but maybe it'll
[16:31] give you a perspective and say Lord help
[16:33] that person and maybe that will be what
[16:35] changes them and maybe they'll come in
[16:37] to this house and be changed we've been
[16:39] changed amen amen the Lord knows
[16:43] everything we're going to dismiss the
[16:44] children now on this song I'm going to
[16:46] be gone in the twinkling of an eye

[55:05] let's never take it for granted that
[55:07] that we have a place to worship that
[55:09] that we can we can all gather together
[55:10] and the love that's in this church and
[55:14] and we are fighting we're not this this
[55:18] life that we are living right now it's
[55:20] not what it seems we're fighting against
[55:24] we're not fighting against flesh and
[55:26] blood like we see in the Old Testament
[55:28] we're fighting as the Bible says we're
[55:30] fighting against spirits that influence
[55:34] us that influence us to hate our
[55:39] Brethren that that that teach us to
[55:43] judge one another that that teach us to
[55:47] to Really you see the churches that it
[55:50] drives divisions in between us and we
[55:53] judge people on exclusive doctrines or
[55:55] or the clothes that we wear or the
[55:57] churches that we attend and really we
[56:00] are fighting spiritual wickedness in
[56:02] high places it's not human wickedness
[56:06] it's the spiritual wickedness that
[56:09] influences us to immorality or
[56:12] self-righteousness or or hatred and it's
[56:15] really it influences us to the darkness
[56:20] of this
[56:21] world I want to talk this morning about
[56:24] really about about the difference
[56:25] between darkness and and light and we
[56:29] brother Jordan sang that song
[56:32] that we there's a city where the lamb is
[56:35] the light it's
[56:37] scriptural it's it's from The Book of
[56:41] Revelation and in the Book of Revelation
[56:43] there's there's coming this city the
[56:46] Earth will be wiped clean of sin and
[56:49] there's this coming this city that's
[56:50] going to be built on this mountain
[56:52] that's four square and the Lamb of God
[56:54] will be at the top and and there won't
[56:57] be a sun there won't be a
[57:00] moon there won't be an
[57:02] ocean it's going to be the lamb is the
[57:06] light and you
[57:08] thinking as a scientist you you think
[57:10] how how could that be that this lamb
[57:14] will be the light it'll light up the
[57:15] whole world brother Andrew I bet you
[57:17] there's not even a
[57:19] shadow in the whole city there's going
[57:22] to be some way that this light just
[57:25] covers everywhere and it's going to be
[57:26] the purest light ever and it's just
[57:29] going to always
[57:31] illuminate this world that we're we're
[57:33] coming to but right
[57:36] now we should be representing that light
[57:41] to the
[57:42] world I look at uh Melissa God bless you
[57:47] it's good to have you I didn't notice
[57:48] you there
[57:51] um our
[57:53] church if we are not representing this
[57:57] light brothers and sisters our church
[58:01] would become
[58:02] stagnant and and would stop growing I
[58:05] don't understand how we can be
[58:07] Christians and how we can be excited
[58:10] about what we believe and our church not
[58:13] continue to grow I don't see it I don't
[58:16] see I don't see how we could be in the
[58:18] Lord's will I see right now I see us
[58:21] witnessing to our neighbors and bringing
[58:23] our neighbors in and witnessing to
[58:25] friends and bringing those friends in
[58:26] and the visitors and that's the way it
[58:28] should be and it shows that we are
[58:31] excited about this gospel that's being
[58:34] preach this gospel that is represented
[58:37] by us but so often people aren't excited
[58:42] they're not proud of what they believe
[58:45] they're almost ashamed to bring somebody
[58:47] to church that's not that's not how we
[58:50] should be I was praying this whole week
[58:53] and I was I was thinking about that
[58:55] green banana that I talked about last
[58:57] week and I was watching that crazy bunch
[58:59] of bananas there up on my
[59:01] refrigerator and they're just not
[59:05] ripening looking at things say these
[59:08] things and what happened was they were
[59:10] just picked too
[59:12] early they weren't developed yet and
[59:16] they might eventually ripen
[59:19] but what I was talking about last week
[59:21] is laying in the presence of the Sun and
[59:26] ripening and I was I was this week
[59:29] praying about our church and a church
[59:34] nowadays churches all over the United
[59:36] States they're defined by they're
[59:38] defined by their
[59:40] pastor and then they're defined by their
[59:43] music and you go and you visit from
[59:45] church to church and you you think okay
[59:48] well I like the way this pastor preaches
[59:49] or I like this music but wouldn't it be
[59:52] wouldn't it be
[59:54] wonderful if our church church was
[59:57] defined by the desire of the people that
[1:00:01] is in their hearts to be right with God
[1:00:04] that are seeking God that are that are
[1:00:07] expressing the Lord Jesus Christ to
[1:00:10] where you come in and you say those
[1:00:12] people are searching those people are
[1:00:15] trying to get closer to God I want to be
[1:00:18] part of that instead of relying on what
[1:00:21] comes from the
[1:00:22] pulpit the pulpit is important I
[1:00:25] understand that
[1:00:28] but it's for the
[1:00:30] people the people are the church not the
[1:00:34] pastor not the music those things are
[1:00:35] wonderful and we appreciate the Lord
[1:00:37] blessing us and and continuing to get
[1:00:39] better but it's about the people that
[1:00:42] are there and can you
[1:00:44] imagine if everyone here had a Ministry
[1:00:49] we should no matter who you are you're
[1:00:51] not too
[1:00:53] old when you retire it means you have
[1:00:57] more
[1:01:01] time now it's up to you what you're
[1:01:03] going to do with that
[1:01:05] time you're going to Ser are you going
[1:01:07] to serve the Lord
[1:01:09] more as as I said our church should be
[1:01:12] growing I look back brother Wilson the
[1:01:15] day the isua Street Revival they came in
[1:01:18] and there was a there was one man that
[1:01:20] that that was maybe a catalyst for it
[1:01:22] this William Seymour but it was the
[1:01:25] people people that they prayed and there
[1:01:28] was people in the church 24 hours a day
[1:01:30] really excited about what they were
[1:01:33] doing and it goes back to the day of
[1:01:36] Pentecost the same thing
[1:01:38] there these people had something real
[1:01:41] they had walked into the
[1:01:45] light and we come to this church and it
[1:01:49] should be a house of correction it
[1:01:52] should be it should correct sin but it
[1:01:55] it's not just for correction for the new
[1:02:00] Believers it's not just for correction
[1:02:03] for the people who are outwardly sin
[1:02:05] sinning it's for correction also for
[1:02:08] those that have been here for 50
[1:02:11] years for those that have been a part of
[1:02:13] the of the message or the church for all
[1:02:15] of these years they need correction too
[1:02:18] and I'm one of them I was born in this
[1:02:21] but we should always be willing to take
[1:02:23] that correction and if we don't we
[1:02:26] deceive ourselves and we
[1:02:29] walk in what the Bible calls
[1:02:34] darkness and we get wrapped around the
[1:02:37] different doctrines and the different
[1:02:38] groups and the different leaders and we
[1:02:40] forget that in this world as I said
[1:02:43] there are powers of light and there are
[1:02:46] powers of darkness and both are
[1:02:48] influencing
[1:02:50] us so what is what is this Darkness all
[1:02:55] all the way
[1:02:57] back to the very beginning of the Bible
[1:02:59] Genesis 1:1 says in the beginning God
[1:03:03] created the heavens and the Earth and
[1:03:05] the Earth was void and without
[1:03:09] form
[1:03:10] and
[1:03:12] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[1:03:16] and the spirit of God
[1:03:20] moved over upon the face of the waters
[1:03:24] and they then things began to change
[1:03:28] something very important happened on at
[1:03:30] that
[1:03:32] time after this Spirit moved across the
[1:03:35] face of the deep and across the waters
[1:03:39] then God
[1:03:41] separated the light from the
[1:03:45] darkness and from that
[1:03:47] point how many years ago we don't know
[1:03:51] but from that point Darkness and Light
[1:03:54] could not coexist
[1:03:56] exist they were forever separated at
[1:03:59] that
[1:04:00] time
[1:04:02] and we look
[1:04:05] today and you can have be in the darkest
[1:04:08] of
[1:04:09] rooms and if you just even light a
[1:04:12] match the darkness will
[1:04:15] flee from that match and it can't it
[1:04:18] can't be together and it'll it'll light
[1:04:20] many times it it can light the whole
[1:04:22] room just one little candle Proverbs
[1:04:25] chapter
[1:04:27] 4 verse 18 says this but the path of the
[1:04:31] just is as The Shining Light that
[1:04:34] shineth more and more unto the perfect
[1:04:37] day The Way of the Wicked is as Darkness
[1:04:40] they know
[1:04:41] not at what they stumble so when we
[1:04:45] think of darkness in the Bible we we
[1:04:48] think of
[1:04:49] sin but it's not
[1:04:52] that don't all of us you think well
[1:04:57] this person is walking in darkness
[1:05:00] or or you think of the many times it's
[1:05:03] mentioned it's not sin there's a
[1:05:05] difference between darkness and sin
[1:05:08] Darkness means you don't know where
[1:05:10] you're going you don't have leadership
[1:05:14] in your life you're just walking along
[1:05:16] and you're bumping into this and you're
[1:05:18] bumping into that and you're going
[1:05:20] through
[1:05:21] life without a focus without anything
[1:05:24] lighting your path
[1:05:26] and it may be a
[1:05:27] religious system that you're
[1:05:30] in and you just walking along
[1:05:34] and you see people that they don't they
[1:05:38] don't really want to walk in the light
[1:05:40] they're they're teaching their children
[1:05:42] to live certain ways they may teach them
[1:05:43] to be good people or they may they may
[1:05:46] teach them to be successful but the
[1:05:49] light is not where they want to go
[1:05:53] because it might condemn them
[1:05:56] and by our own
[1:05:58] choice we seek answers and many times we
[1:06:01] seek the answers in the darkness of our
[1:06:03] own minds and of our own
[1:06:06] reason rather than seeking the answers
[1:06:08] in the light of
[1:06:11] God and brothers and sisters every one
[1:06:14] of us here struggles we all struggle
[1:06:17] with sin but before you came into the
[1:06:22] light let me ask you and think about
[1:06:24] this before you came came into the light
[1:06:26] of the Holy Spirit did you struggle with
[1:06:29] sin no you didn't care you just went out
[1:06:33] and you sinned and you you did you you
[1:06:38] ruined your life or or you caused
[1:06:40] problems in your life and then when you
[1:06:42] come back and when you come into this
[1:06:44] light now you start struggling with sin
[1:06:48] because this light tells you now what
[1:06:50] sin
[1:06:52] is from everything in your life
[1:06:56] from A to Z this light of the holy
[1:06:59] spirit will tell
[1:07:00] you what sin
[1:07:03] is now let's go I'm going to be speaking
[1:07:08] about today about this Apostle
[1:07:12] John and I'm going to we'll start in the
[1:07:16] Gospel of John and then we'll move on to
[1:07:20] um John's first letter so let's turn to
[1:07:23] John
[1:07:24] 3 the Gospel of John
[1:07:32] 3:14 and as Moses lifted up the serpent
[1:07:35] in the
[1:07:36] wilderness even so must the son of man
[1:07:39] be lifted up that whosoever believeth in
[1:07:41] him should not perish but have eternal
[1:07:45] life for God so loved the world that he
[1:07:47] gave his only begotten son that
[1:07:50] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:07:52] perish but have everlasting life for God
[1:07:56] sent not his son into the world to
[1:07:58] condemn the world but that the world
[1:08:00] through him might be saved he that
[1:08:03] believeth on him is not condemned but he
[1:08:06] that believeth not is condemned already
[1:08:09] because he hath not believed in the name
[1:08:11] of the only begotten Son of
[1:08:14] God this is an exclusive religion
[1:08:18] brothers and sisters and no one else is
[1:08:20] included in this statement from the Lord
[1:08:22] Jesus it is to believe on Jesus Christ
[1:08:26] and him only it's not any other
[1:08:30] Savior and this is the condemnation that
[1:08:33] the light is come into the world and Men
[1:08:36] love Darkness rather than light because
[1:08:40] their deeds were
[1:08:44] evil it's hard for a Christian to
[1:08:47] imagine that that this spirit is among
[1:08:52] us we immediately think of someone who's
[1:08:54] cheating on their wife or or going to
[1:08:56] bars or sleeping around but those who
[1:08:58] love to walk in darkness they they don't
[1:09:01] want the light to be turned
[1:09:03] on because they like the way that
[1:09:05] they're
[1:09:06] living and I'm not just talking about
[1:09:08] the obvious as they keep saying I'm
[1:09:11] talking about the people who come to
[1:09:14] church but they get offended at the word
[1:09:16] when it calls them
[1:09:18] self-righteous or they dis or disagrees
[1:09:21] with their own way of thinking people
[1:09:23] want to come to church and call Jesus
[1:09:26] their savior we all
[1:09:28] do but they don't want him to be their
[1:09:31] lord and ruler in every aspect of their
[1:09:35] life for everyone that doeth evil hateth
[1:09:39] the light neither cometh to the light
[1:09:42] lest his deeds should be
[1:09:45] reproved you don't have to come to this
[1:09:49] church this church you don't have to
[1:09:51] come here to be a Christian I'm not
[1:09:54] saying that you don't have to there's no
[1:09:57] specific church that that God just deals
[1:10:00] specifically with it is through his son
[1:10:02] Jesus Christ but I have invited people
[1:10:06] to this
[1:10:07] church and they have there's a two-fold
[1:10:12] reason that they have not come now they
[1:10:14] weren't going to other churches it
[1:10:15] wasn't trying to pull them from
[1:10:16] somewhere else they weren't going to
[1:10:18] church but the first
[1:10:20] one is because they didn't want to
[1:10:22] change their life they knew what the
[1:10:25] church stands for they didn't want to
[1:10:27] come here and then change the what
[1:10:30] they're doing on the weekends change
[1:10:32] their their sinful living they wanted to
[1:10:35] go if they going to go to church they're
[1:10:36] going to go to another church that
[1:10:38] accepts that and doesn't say anything
[1:10:40] about it and in doing so they're walking
[1:10:42] in
[1:10:43] darkness the light is there to tell them
[1:10:47] what's true but they want they choose to
[1:10:50] walk in this Darkness that's that I'm
[1:10:52] saying I'm not talking about this this
[1:10:54] specific Church I'm talking about a
[1:10:56] church that truly preaches the word of
[1:10:59] God that people don't want to be part of
[1:11:01] because they would have to change their
[1:11:04] lives and then there's
[1:11:07] others that
[1:11:08] come
[1:11:10] that
[1:11:12] they
[1:11:15] genuinely
[1:11:16] are how do I say it without offending a
[1:11:19] lot of people they're they're genuinely
[1:11:22] they're
[1:11:24] self-righteous and they might come to
[1:11:26] the church and say oh you don't they
[1:11:28] don't teach this they don't look like
[1:11:30] they should here he the the pastor
[1:11:33] doesn't preach hard enough against this
[1:11:35] and in doing so they are lifting
[1:11:37] themselves up and they're putting out
[1:11:40] everything else like the Pharisees like
[1:11:43] the Sadducees and this is who Jesus is
[1:11:46] talking to right here he's talking to a
[1:11:48] Pharisee when he's when he's speaking
[1:11:50] these words and they think that they're
[1:11:53] too good and in doing so they are
[1:11:56] sinning just like the one over here that
[1:11:59] wants to keep going to the
[1:12:01] bars they're doing the same
[1:12:03] thing and then
[1:12:06] they choose a church that doesn't
[1:12:11] condemn
[1:12:12] them for being that sinful person of a
[1:12:17] self-righteous
[1:12:23] self-righteousness verse number 21 one
[1:12:26] but he that doeth truth cometh to the
[1:12:29] light that his deeds may be manifest may
[1:12:31] be made manifest that they are wrought
[1:12:34] in
[1:12:35] God so friends our F our light as I said
[1:12:38] should be shining all the time the world
[1:12:41] sees sees
[1:12:43] us
[1:12:45] but through our Deeds it see it sees us
[1:12:48] and we're doing things by the spirit of
[1:12:51] God now let's go to John
[1:12:53] 12:46 the Lord Jesus says
[1:12:56] this I am come a light into the world
[1:13:00] that whosoever believeth on me should
[1:13:02] not abide in darkness the same
[1:13:07] one that wrote those words is the same
[1:13:12] one that separated the light from the
[1:13:13] darkness in the Book of Genesis is the
[1:13:17] same one that brother Jordan was singing
[1:13:18] that song that um there's a city where
[1:13:22] the lamb is the light he is that light
[1:13:25] light and he came here and like he did
[1:13:30] with the Apostle John John witnessed
[1:13:33] this light I want to talk about John for
[1:13:37] a minute while just trying to get into
[1:13:40] the spirit here this man John he was a
[1:13:45] young
[1:13:46] man a disciple of the Lord he was a
[1:13:50] disciple of John the Baptist and John
[1:13:52] the Baptist taught him he said sat under
[1:13:55] his ministry and then when John the
[1:13:57] Baptist saw Jesus John said John the
[1:14:00] Baptist said Behold the Lamb of God that
[1:14:02] takes away the sins of the world and
[1:14:04] this young man John who I'm talking
[1:14:07] about right now he and Andrew sees John
[1:14:10] the Baptist say this and he goes and
[1:14:13] then he follows this Jesus that John the
[1:14:16] Baptist was talking about and then he
[1:14:18] became very close to the
[1:14:22] Lord he was the one that laid on Jesus's
[1:14:27] chest in the last
[1:14:30] supper and he was the one that was
[1:14:36] exiled to the island called patmas he
[1:14:39] was the one that was boiled in oil and
[1:14:42] they couldn't kill him and he was the
[1:14:44] one that lived to be an old
[1:14:48] man and he writes this
[1:14:52] epistle 1 John chapter CH one he says
[1:14:58] this that which was from the beginning
[1:15:01] which we have heard which we have seen
[1:15:03] with our eyes which we have looked upon
[1:15:05] and our hands have handled the word of
[1:15:09] life so he's saying that hey I saw this
[1:15:12] man I was with him and you know who John
[1:15:15] was John was probably the last person on
[1:15:17] Earth that was ever with Jesus Christ
[1:15:20] when he wrote this letter later on I
[1:15:23] believe is uh in chapter 2 he says he
[1:15:26] says I am the Elder and he really was
[1:15:29] the
[1:15:30] Elder he was the oldest one everybody
[1:15:33] else had been killed Paul had been
[1:15:36] executed Paul wasn't with Jesus but Paul
[1:15:37] had had his head cut off Peter was
[1:15:39] crucified all of these other ones had
[1:15:41] been put to death and he was the one
[1:15:43] that was left brother brandom talks
[1:15:45] about him and he says that and this is
[1:15:49] also in historians have written this too
[1:15:52] that John would preach and he would say
[1:15:54] little children just love one another
[1:15:56] just love each other don't don't don't
[1:15:59] argue don't bicker just be one
[1:16:05] together for the life was manifested and
[1:16:09] we have seen it and bear witness and
[1:16:11] show unto you that eternal life which is
[1:16:15] with which which with the Father which
[1:16:18] was with the father and was manifest
[1:16:21] manifested to us so John's talking about
[1:16:23] this eternal life which was with the
[1:16:26] father and was manifested through his
[1:16:29] son Jesus
[1:16:31] Christ
[1:16:34] there's a lot of misconception about
[1:16:38] forgiveness and about
[1:16:40] salvation in the world and and as
[1:16:42] probably many people here probably don't
[1:16:46] understand what this idea of Christ is
[1:16:50] God is a God of
[1:16:53] Justice which means if someone sins or
[1:16:57] if there's a crime committed or if there
[1:17:00] is a debt that debt must be paid God
[1:17:04] wouldn't be a righteous God if he
[1:17:07] said don't worry about the debt you're
[1:17:11] forgiven uh just don't do it again
[1:17:14] that's not a God of
[1:17:15] Justice a just God requires payment 100%
[1:17:21] of the time all the time if you sin or
[1:17:24] if I sin God requires an atonement for
[1:17:29] that sin all the time he is
[1:17:32] just and that's why I can forgive you he
[1:17:35] you can you can do something to me and I
[1:17:37] can say oh you're
[1:17:39] forgiven but God
[1:17:42] requires an atonement for
[1:17:45] that
[1:17:48] so
[1:17:50] right
[1:17:52] remember this payment
[1:17:58] was in his son Jesus Christ when he died
[1:18:00] on the cross the song what does how does
[1:18:03] the song go he He Paid a Debt he did not
[1:18:05] owe I I owed a debt I could not
[1:18:07] pay God the father he required
[1:18:10] payment but Jesus was able to make an
[1:18:14] atonement for that so that's
[1:18:16] Christianity in a in a nutshell so when
[1:18:20] we understand that he someone has to pay
[1:18:22] for our
[1:18:23] sins do we really want to
[1:18:27] sin do we really want to put the Lord
[1:18:30] through that when we know that that he
[1:18:32] was the atonement that he died on the
[1:18:34] cross for me he made all of this efforts
[1:18:37] for me and and made all of this
[1:18:38] sacrifice and then I want to go and I
[1:18:40] want to sin
[1:18:41] more just so he will atone for it that's
[1:18:45] not a
[1:18:46] Christian that which we have seen and
[1:18:49] heard declare we unto you ye Also may
[1:18:52] have Fellowship that ye Also may have
[1:18:54] fellowship with us and truly our
[1:18:56] fellowship is with the father and with
[1:18:58] his son Jesus Christ and these things
[1:19:01] write we unto you that your joy may be
[1:19:04] full this then is the message which we
[1:19:09] have heard of him and declare unto you
[1:19:11] that God is light and in him no Darkness
[1:19:16] at all remember Darkness and Light Co
[1:19:19] cannot
[1:19:20] coexist they're separated from the
[1:19:23] beginning by by by definition darkness
[1:19:26] is the absence of
[1:19:29] light so if we say that we have
[1:19:31] fellowship with him and walk in darkness
[1:19:33] we lie and do not the truth don't assume
[1:19:36] as I said don't assume that walking in
[1:19:38] darkness is walking in sin when you're
[1:19:40] walking in darkness you have no
[1:19:43] Direction
[1:19:45] Darkness brother and sisters darkness is
[1:19:47] way worse than sin do you remember the
[1:19:50] story that brother Bram tells when he
[1:19:52] was in Memphis and he was walking along
[1:19:55] the the road and he had to catch a
[1:19:58] flight and he was singing I think he was
[1:20:00] singing one of them I'm one of them and
[1:20:03] something told him to just keep walking
[1:20:06] brother L you sing a song about it he
[1:20:09] goes and he sees this this black lady
[1:20:13] there and she knows him because she had
[1:20:16] seen a dream about him the night before
[1:20:19] and her son it's probably in his late
[1:20:23] teens I would guess
[1:20:25] was dying of a venial
[1:20:27] disease and he's laying in the
[1:20:30] bed out of his mind and he's clutching
[1:20:33] the blanket and he's saying it's dark
[1:20:37] it's
[1:20:38] dark you can see that that darkness is
[1:20:42] something far worse than sin when
[1:20:45] brother brandom had when
[1:20:47] he went on the other side when he was
[1:20:51] under anesthesia and he was being
[1:20:53] operated on his leg and remember he went
[1:20:55] to
[1:20:57] hell and he said it was all it was
[1:21:01] Darkness he said he cried out for his
[1:21:03] mom and there was no Mom there he cried
[1:21:05] out for his daddy there was no Daddy
[1:21:07] there he said he cried out for God and
[1:21:10] there was no God
[1:21:12] there that's what hell is it's this it's
[1:21:15] this never ending it's this darkness
[1:21:19] that we that that we choose to go to
[1:21:27] when we have fellowship and John talks a
[1:21:32] lot about Fellowship here when we have
[1:21:34] Fellowship we want to fellowship with
[1:21:36] those that are in the light not not cut
[1:21:38] people out but we want that light to be
[1:21:41] around us when we're
[1:21:44] fellowshipping I was I'm building a
[1:21:47] house and I uh walked in and brother Dan
[1:21:53] the uh the drywall guys were fighting
[1:21:57] with the electricians and it was bad I
[1:22:00] could hear it
[1:22:01] outside and uh obviously well the
[1:22:04] drywall guys didn't speak very good
[1:22:06] English but they spoke enough English to
[1:22:09] uh to say things that they shouldn't
[1:22:11] have been saying the electricians they
[1:22:14] they were they they spoke English so
[1:22:16] they were going back and forth and I
[1:22:17] walk into my house and there's my
[1:22:19] general contractor and he's sitting
[1:22:21] there and he's just watching these guys
[1:22:23] and he doesn't know what to do do and
[1:22:25] when I walked in they kind of quieted it
[1:22:29] down so I go I go to the electrician and
[1:22:34] and what had happened is the drywall
[1:22:38] guys they were young they were kids and
[1:22:40] they were hanging the sheetrock and they
[1:22:42] poked holes in the ceiling in places
[1:22:45] that the electrician didn't want the
[1:22:46] wires to come through and it was
[1:22:49] terrible it was all off and and the
[1:22:51] electricians were mad they were like
[1:22:53] they shouldn't have poked any holes we
[1:22:54] go in there and we have everything
[1:22:55] mapped out so I was like listen I told
[1:22:58] the electrician I said listen it was my
[1:23:00] fault I said I was here when those guys
[1:23:03] were there I said they're kids I was
[1:23:05] here when they were cutting the holes
[1:23:07] and I said it was my I should have known
[1:23:08] better I knew the lights weren't going
[1:23:10] to W to go there and they even looked at
[1:23:12] me and asked me a couple questions and
[1:23:15] and I said it's my fault and the
[1:23:18] electrician was like oh all right well
[1:23:20] you know well we'll fix it we'll we'll
[1:23:22] get it all right you know so they get in
[1:23:23] there the electrician go up they stuff
[1:23:25] the wires back in there and then the
[1:23:26] drywall guys patch it then I go over to
[1:23:28] the drywall guys and they're like
[1:23:31] they're they're they're mad at these
[1:23:32] guys and I said listen I said I was here
[1:23:35] when you were hanging the sheetrock I
[1:23:36] said it's my fault I should have told
[1:23:38] you not to poke any holes and just let
[1:23:40] leave the leave the wires up
[1:23:43] there and then they well well we're
[1:23:46] sorry we we shouldn't have done it so so
[1:23:49] then calm down and then they start
[1:23:51] working and they start talking and and
[1:23:54] things get better so I go to my general
[1:23:56] contractor and really this was all his
[1:24:00] fault you guys know Michael he's not
[1:24:03] here
[1:24:04] right no if he's sorry Michael if you're
[1:24:06] streaming
[1:24:08] in so so Michael said he said Daniel he
[1:24:14] says I've never seen anything like
[1:24:17] that he says everything just calms right
[1:24:20] down and I said I said Michael I said
[1:24:23] listen I said this wisest man that had
[1:24:25] ever lived King Solomon said he said a
[1:24:31] soft answer turns away
[1:24:34] wrath and Michael's like wow he says he
[1:24:38] says you know that Bible he says I never
[1:24:42] knew that stuff like that was in I said
[1:24:44] I said Michael it's it's our whole life
[1:24:47] everything that's in this Bible is just
[1:24:48] filled with wisdom and we can live our
[1:24:50] whole life by by by just watching this
[1:24:54] and reading it and then applying it to
[1:24:57] every aspect of our life and as I was
[1:25:00] thinking about this whole
[1:25:04] situation I was like Lord that worked
[1:25:06] out
[1:25:07] well
[1:25:09] um why did it work out so
[1:25:12] well and like I said this was not my
[1:25:15] fault the contractor he should have
[1:25:17] known and and the kids hang in the
[1:25:20] drywall they should have known not to
[1:25:21] punch these holes in there and pull the
[1:25:22] wires out electrician he was just he's a
[1:25:25] hotthead he was he was mad and when I
[1:25:30] thought about it what diffused the whole
[1:25:35] situation is that I was a man of
[1:25:37] authority and I took the
[1:25:40] blame even though it wasn't my fault but
[1:25:43] look at the Spirit of Christ in a
[1:25:46] Christian don't always think that if
[1:25:49] it's someone else's fault that you can't
[1:25:51] take the
[1:25:52] blame Jesus Took the blame for
[1:25:56] you and if we have the spirit of Christ
[1:26:00] then we can also take the blame for
[1:26:03] other
[1:26:04] people but if we walk in the
[1:26:08] light as he is in the light we have
[1:26:13] Fellowship one with another and the
[1:26:16] blood of Jesus Christ his Jesus Christ
[1:26:20] his son cleanses us from all sin
[1:26:23] remember God requires payment he
[1:26:26] requires somebody to take the
[1:26:28] blame if we say that we have no sin then
[1:26:30] we deceive ourselves and the truth and
[1:26:32] the truth is not in us if we confess our
[1:26:35] sins he is faithful and just to forgive
[1:26:39] us our sins to cleanse us from all
[1:26:43] unrighteousness Lord I'm walking in your
[1:26:45] light it doesn't mean that I don't sin
[1:26:49] it means that the Holy Spirit Within Me
[1:26:51] corrects me of my sins and I repent and
[1:26:54] when I Repent I ask God to forgive me
[1:26:57] and he
[1:26:59] does because of Jesus
[1:27:02] Christ if we say that we have not sinned
[1:27:06] we make him a liar and his word is not
[1:27:09] in
[1:27:11] us so who's John talking to
[1:27:14] here he's he's talking to he's writing
[1:27:17] this letter to
[1:27:19] Believers and he's telling people that
[1:27:22] if you walking in sin that there's no
[1:27:25] light in you and you make God a liar if
[1:27:29] you say that you are you have no sin
[1:27:32] have you ever met someone that says they
[1:27:34] have no sin I
[1:27:37] haven't everybody say oh well I sin well
[1:27:39] what do you
[1:27:40] do
[1:27:42] well um and then they'll come up with
[1:27:44] some little
[1:27:46] thing but they have the attitude of
[1:27:49] someone that doesn't sin they have the
[1:27:52] attitude of being better than someone
[1:27:54] else but if you commit there are there
[1:27:56] are different sins and people say that
[1:27:59] oh well every sin's the same every sin
[1:28:01] is not the same every sin will send you
[1:28:04] to hell but some sins have a greater
[1:28:08] magnitude and a greater effect on you
[1:28:11] than other sins have if you go and you
[1:28:15] cheat on your
[1:28:17] wife or
[1:28:20] you come you rob a bank or you Mur
[1:28:24] murder someone that has a lot stiffer
[1:28:27] consequences in the
[1:28:29] flesh but if you tell this you know a
[1:28:33] white lie or or or you do something that
[1:28:36] is
[1:28:37] wrong but it doesn't have the
[1:28:39] consequences you don't have to suffer
[1:28:41] the consequences as much in the flesh
[1:28:43] however all sin whether it's the lowest
[1:28:46] or the highest can send you to hell and
[1:28:49] just because you commit a little sin
[1:28:52] don't think that you're better than
[1:28:53] someone else because you might be
[1:28:55] committing the greater sin in
[1:28:58] self-righteousness or living like the
[1:29:03] Pharisees I'll hurry up let's go to um
[1:29:06] chapter two my little children these
[1:29:09] things write I onto you that you sin not
[1:29:12] and if any man sin we have an advocate
[1:29:14] with the father Jesus Christ the
[1:29:15] righteous and he is the perpetuation of
[1:29:17] our sins and not for ours only but also
[1:29:20] for the sins of the whole
[1:29:22] world Jesus is not exclusive to a
[1:29:25] denomination or a sect or a cult or a
[1:29:28] certain group of
[1:29:30] people even if they believe Malachi
[1:29:33] 4 he is
[1:29:36] not exclusive to them he's just too big
[1:29:41] for our religion we can't put him in a
[1:29:43] box and limit it to one little group of
[1:29:45] people he died for the sins as John said
[1:29:47] of the entire world and it is our
[1:29:50] responsibility to get the world to
[1:29:55] him and hereby we do know that we know
[1:29:59] him if we keep his
[1:30:02] commandments so if we take the
[1:30:08] law and we apply it to our lives we
[1:30:12] apply what Jesus said to our lives and
[1:30:14] we don't say well it's not a big deal if
[1:30:17] I do this but it's a big deal if you do
[1:30:20] that we're not keeping the Lord Jesus's
[1:30:22] Commandments we keep all of his commands
[1:30:24] Commandments and friends don't think I'm
[1:30:26] preaching something different here than
[1:30:28] brother Brandon preached every
[1:30:30] sermon he wanted us to follow Jesus
[1:30:34] Christ what we have done is we've taken
[1:30:37] little things and we have made dogmas
[1:30:39] out of those things but listen to him
[1:30:42] yourself it is to be applied to every
[1:30:45] aspect of Our Lives from when we wake up
[1:30:46] in the morning to when we go to bed at
[1:30:50] night if our message becomes a set of
[1:30:52] Creeds then the sin and darkness really
[1:30:54] the sin and darkness they really follow
[1:30:56] it removes the Holy Spirit out of the
[1:30:59] out as leadership of the
[1:31:02] individual we
[1:31:05] um we when we were in Jeffersonville we
[1:31:08] um had we started the young foundation's
[1:31:12] um youth ministry and and it was really
[1:31:15] going good all these kids are they're
[1:31:17] really they're they're really excited
[1:31:20] about serving the lord and this was when
[1:31:23] the social media started going do you
[1:31:25] remember what Myspace
[1:31:27] is well Myspace comes
[1:31:30] out and Brother Joseph brandham he was
[1:31:33] like this is just this is not good and
[1:31:36] we were all talking it's like this is
[1:31:38] this is
[1:31:39] just you can tell this is not going to
[1:31:42] end well
[1:31:45] so Brother Joseph starts telling the
[1:31:48] kids hey preaching against mypace and we
[1:31:51] all start saying hey don't don't
[1:31:54] this Myspace thing don't get caught up
[1:31:56] into that so then they say okay we won't
[1:32:00] we're doing what Brother Joseph said and
[1:32:01] then they go to
[1:32:05] Facebook and it's like what are you guys
[1:32:08] doing and then say something about that
[1:32:10] then they go to this then they go over
[1:32:12] here to that they didn't catch the
[1:32:15] vision I'm not preaching against social
[1:32:17] media but we all know the Perils of
[1:32:19] social media they didn't they it it
[1:32:22] became a rule and rule rules bring in
[1:32:25] sin that wasn't the purpose of it the
[1:32:28] purpose of it was to watch this because
[1:32:30] the enemy can use these
[1:32:33] things let's skip down to uh verse
[1:32:37] 11 but he that hateth his brother is in
[1:32:40] darkness and walketh in darkness and
[1:32:42] knoweth not whether he goeth because
[1:32:45] that Darkness has blinded his eyes again
[1:32:47] walking in darkness doesn't mean that
[1:32:49] you're walking in sin it means that you
[1:32:54] can't see your
[1:32:57] sins I write unto you the little
[1:33:00] children because your sins are forgiven
[1:33:02] you of his for his name's sake I write
[1:33:05] unto you fathers because you have known
[1:33:06] him that is from the beginning I write
[1:33:09] unto you young men because you have
[1:33:11] overcome the wicked one I write unto you
[1:33:13] little children because you have known
[1:33:15] the father how encouraging I have
[1:33:18] written unto you fathers because you
[1:33:19] have known him that is from the
[1:33:21] beginning I have written unto you young
[1:33:23] men in because you are strong and the
[1:33:25] word of God abideth in you and you have
[1:33:28] overcome the wicked one love not the
[1:33:31] world neither the things that are in the
[1:33:33] world if any man love the world the love
[1:33:37] of the father is not in
[1:33:40] him so brothers and sisters if we're
[1:33:42] looking at the
[1:33:44] world for our
[1:33:46] example of course then we're patterning
[1:33:49] ourselves after the world I want to get
[1:33:52] down to um
[1:33:56] verse uh let's go down to verse 25 and
[1:33:58] this is the promise that he hath
[1:34:00] promised us even eternal life these
[1:34:04] things have I written unto you
[1:34:05] concerning them that seduce
[1:34:09] you but the
[1:34:12] anointing which you have received of him
[1:34:15] abideth in you and ye need not that any
[1:34:18] man teach you but the same anointing
[1:34:21] teacheth you of all things and is truth
[1:34:25] and is no lie and even as it hath taught
[1:34:28] you you shall abide in him and that's
[1:34:33] what I want to concentrate on for the
[1:34:34] next couple minutes as we as we wind it
[1:34:37] down as we close that John is telling us
[1:34:40] to let the Holy Spirit lead in every
[1:34:42] aspect of our lives and if you have the
[1:34:45] Holy Spirit then you are able to abide
[1:34:48] in Christ in all things and many
[1:34:51] churches are all about rules
[1:34:54] there that that you cut this length this
[1:34:57] this this is appropriate this isn't
[1:34:59] appropriate and when we do that Heath we
[1:35:01] take out the Holy Spirit out of the
[1:35:05] equation many times not many times a
[1:35:08] couple times I've had people ask me be
[1:35:13] more
[1:35:14] specific when you're talking
[1:35:17] about what we should and what we
[1:35:19] shouldn't
[1:35:21] do brothers and sisters I can't do that
[1:35:24] John right here is teaching the exact
[1:35:26] opposite of that because when I teach
[1:35:29] that if I had if I was teaching
[1:35:31] specifics like don't do this do that
[1:35:34] then I would allow sin to come in to the
[1:35:38] congregation and take out the holy
[1:35:40] spirit in the individual that that Holy
[1:35:43] Spirit will make you more holy than if
[1:35:46] you have a set of Creeds or dogmas for
[1:35:50] the church that's what people don't
[1:35:52] understand
[1:35:54] it's all about this Spirit as John is
[1:35:56] saying here that this spirit is going to
[1:35:59] teach you you don't need that any man
[1:36:01] teach you it doesn't mean that you
[1:36:02] shouldn't have a preacher up here
[1:36:04] teaching the Bible it doesn't mean that
[1:36:06] you shouldn't have a pastor pointing you
[1:36:07] in the right direction that's not what
[1:36:09] it means but it means that you don't
[1:36:12] need someone to teach you in every
[1:36:14] aspect of your life because that is the
[1:36:16] role of the Holy
[1:36:21] Spirit one example examp le as we close
[1:36:25] and the musicians can come one example I
[1:36:27] want to read of brother
[1:36:30] brandom it's so easy for us to divide
[1:36:34] the Mormons will divide on Joseph Smith
[1:36:37] and the Book of Mormon the 7eventh day
[1:36:40] Adventist they will divide on worshiping
[1:36:42] on Saturday and if you don't adhere to
[1:36:45] that then you're cut
[1:36:47] out again it takes out the Holy Spirit
[1:36:51] from the
[1:36:52] individual
[1:36:54] brother brandom said this in questions
[1:36:56] and
[1:36:58] answers now first question I pulled out
[1:37:01] of here brother brandom is it wrong for
[1:37:03] a Christian to put her hair in pin
[1:37:07] curls also what length should her
[1:37:09] sleeves be thank you a
[1:37:13] sister that's a pretty common question
[1:37:16] can we wear this sleeve oh should I wear
[1:37:17] that or is this is um is this knit skirt
[1:37:20] okay or is is is this jean skirt all
[1:37:23] right right questions all the time about
[1:37:27] that listen to way the prophet answers
[1:37:31] it he he talks about the pin Cur the uh
[1:37:35] the whatever they're called he didn't
[1:37:36] know what they were either um
[1:37:40] but he didn't
[1:37:42] um and uh the links of the
[1:37:45] sleeves I think being a
[1:37:48] Christian God would tell you what to do
[1:37:51] about those things you see
[1:37:54] I believe as a Christian person you know
[1:37:57] about how to do that I don't think God
[1:37:59] Cuts any certain links or whatever it is
[1:38:02] as long as you're decent and look
[1:38:04] honorable and clean I think that's all
[1:38:08] right don't you look at the
[1:38:11] wisdom that brother brandom speaks
[1:38:14] because if he would cut a length we are
[1:38:17] people we would find a way to stick sin
[1:38:19] in
[1:38:21] there I talked with uh years ago husband
[1:38:24] and a
[1:38:25] wife was was uh talking with them and
[1:38:30] the
[1:38:31] sister the the husband said he says you
[1:38:35] know he says the woman's dress he says
[1:38:37] it's not that's not what gets you to
[1:38:40] heaven and the
[1:38:43] wife she snaps back at her husband and
[1:38:46] she says well why don't I just put on a
[1:38:47] short skirt and high heels and and just
[1:38:50] strut around like
[1:38:52] that and then I believe believe the lord
[1:38:54] gave me the answer I said sister I said
[1:38:57] why would you want to look like
[1:39:01] that I said what is in
[1:39:05] you that would want to look so much like
[1:39:09] the
[1:39:10] world there's something there's
[1:39:12] something there and the the answer is
[1:39:15] she had not gone far enough her Holiness
[1:39:18] was a self-righteous Holiness but her
[1:39:20] own testimony said that she was walking
[1:39:23] in
[1:39:25] darkness because the Lord wasn't dealing
[1:39:27] directly with
[1:39:29] her she had not I could tell she did not
[1:39:32] have that
[1:39:35] experience pure religion brothers and
[1:39:38] sisters pure religion requires a
[1:39:41] complete surrender to God in every
[1:39:45] aspect of Our
[1:39:47] Lives from the way we dress to the way
[1:39:50] we talk to the to how we earn our
[1:39:54] money everything requires a complete and
[1:39:58] utter surrender and if we're trying to
[1:40:01] go by what the pastor says and trying to
[1:40:04] cut certain links and cut certain lines
[1:40:07] it will bring in
[1:40:10] sin and then we'll be just walking
[1:40:15] around in
[1:40:18] darkness and now little
[1:40:22] children verse 28 and now little
[1:40:24] children abide in him that when he shall
[1:40:27] appear we may have confidence and not be
[1:40:29] ashamed before him at is coming if ye
[1:40:32] know that he is righteous ye know that
[1:40:35] everyone that doeth righteousness is
[1:40:38] born of
[1:40:39] [Music]
[1:40:42] him
[1:40:45] and praying about this sermon and and
[1:40:48] talking about the difference between
[1:40:51] light and darkness and and talking about
[1:40:55] loving the world or the things that are
[1:40:57] in the world brothers and sisters
[1:40:59] there's so
[1:41:01] many times that we really don't know
[1:41:04] what to do we really don't understand
[1:41:07] things we say God where are you am I
[1:41:10] even right is is what's what's going on
[1:41:13] here I feel like I'm just walking around
[1:41:16] through this world and I just don't
[1:41:18] understand
[1:41:21] things I don't know if anyone else has
[1:41:24] had that
[1:41:25] feeling but it's really it's
[1:41:29] common but the bottom
[1:41:32] line is that
[1:41:35] light of the holy spirit will light our
[1:41:39] path if we diligently seek
[1:41:43] Him imagine
[1:41:45] it my wife and I were walking the other
[1:41:48] day
[1:41:49] and she said
[1:41:52] imagine if your child was
[1:41:56] dying and the only way you knew that
[1:41:59] there was a
[1:42:02] cure and you had to find some way to get
[1:42:05] over on the other side of the world say
[1:42:07] say
[1:42:08] China to get that vaccine or whatever it
[1:42:12] was and bring it back to your child and
[1:42:15] that child would be healed what effort
[1:42:17] would you make to do it you would do
[1:42:20] everything that you
[1:42:22] could but
[1:42:24] now death and darkness is at the door
[1:42:29] and we won't make an effort to get on
[1:42:31] our
[1:42:32] knees we won't make an effort to reach
[1:42:35] out to someone who who who is suffering
[1:42:39] or that is in
[1:42:42] sin we talk about being
[1:42:46] Christians but are are we really are we
[1:42:48] really doing everything that we
[1:42:52] can
[1:42:57] I say it all the time we need to do
[1:42:59] [Music]
[1:43:02] more Darkness and Light can't abide
[1:43:07] together and in darkness does not
[1:43:10] necessarily mean outward sin there's
[1:43:13] many times that we will go to a church
[1:43:16] and we want to walk in darkness because
[1:43:19] we don't want to
[1:43:22] change and we choose
[1:43:24] that I hope that everyone
[1:43:29] considers I was talking with uh brother
[1:43:31] Sean I see you back there Sean and I
[1:43:34] were talking the other day
[1:43:36] outside
[1:43:37] and there was uh all the kids were out
[1:43:41] there and everybody was playing and and
[1:43:45] brother Sean was I like can you imagine
[1:43:48] can can you believe just how the Lord's
[1:43:50] blessed
[1:43:51] us and
[1:43:53] but Sean said something to
[1:43:56] me that I mean it meant the world to me
[1:44:01] he said yeah he
[1:44:02] says I'm going to hope I get you right
[1:44:05] when when I say it but if not I'll make
[1:44:08] you come up here and say
[1:44:10] it Sean's
[1:44:12] like
[1:44:13] um but Sean says that he says yeah I've
[1:44:19] talked about the church before and some
[1:44:21] people have said oh you know not not you
[1:44:24] know not not that church not that and
[1:44:27] Sean said no he said it's not like
[1:44:31] that and I it made brother Sean that
[1:44:34] made me feel so
[1:44:36] good I want to make sure it's something
[1:44:39] real and it's not just going through the
[1:44:41] motions of going to church it's finding
[1:44:45] God and walking out of Darkness into his
[1:44:50] glorious light that's what I wanted to
[1:44:53] be and I believe that's what all of us
[1:44:55] want we don't want this dark world where
[1:45:01] we serve ourselves and and we are making
[1:45:04] all of our decisions even if it's not
[1:45:06] what we want it to be Lord Let It Be
[1:45:09] Your Will and not our will let's let's

[1:48:03] pray I had
[1:48:06] um a lot

[1:48:13] wanted to say but I just felt like the
[1:48:15] Lord said no let's uh let's stop it
[1:48:19] there and let's bring the people to pray
[1:48:26] and to present their lives before the
[1:48:30] Lord and ask
[1:48:31] Lord if I am walking in darkness I don't
[1:48:34] want to walk in darkness I want to walk
[1:48:37] in this glorious
[1:48:38] light and I want
[1:48:40] to I want to give my life over to him
[1:48:43] and I I want to Lord
[1:48:46] not lower your word to just a set of

[1:49:00] to come forth and have your Holy Spirit
[1:49:03] be the law that is within me I want your
[1:49:05] Holy Spirit to correct me in all things

[1:49:12] love
[1:49:13] you and I want to live a life that's
[1:49:15] worthy of your gospel if there's
[1:49:18] something within me if it would be any
[1:49:21] type of sin Lord take that sin away from
[1:49:23] me reveal to reveal it to me as as John
[1:49:27] was saying that you don't need any man
[1:49:29] to teach
[1:49:31] you that you need the Holy Spirit to
[1:49:34] convict
[1:49:36] you that's all bow our
[1:49:38] [Music]
[1:49:47] heads Heavenly Father
[1:49:51] we're oh I just I almost can't imagine
[1:49:54] that the the same God that we're praying
[1:49:57] to now is the same God that John prayed
[1:50:01] to the same God that John talked about
[1:50:04] the same Jesus Christ that he laid his
