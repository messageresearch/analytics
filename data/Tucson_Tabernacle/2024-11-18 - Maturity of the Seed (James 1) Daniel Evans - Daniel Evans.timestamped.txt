[16:34] much they gave him millions of dollars
[16:35] in cash to take over to Afghanistan and
[16:37] Iraq to pass out to the subcon because
[16:40] they wanted to be paid in American

[16:50] live in a dream at night he just prayed
[16:54] that was his second prayer he prayed in

[17:22] but God bless you all let's pray that's
[17:25] what we're here
[17:26] for Lord you said did you
[17:29] called this the house of

[17:41] answered the way he
[17:43] wanted but we're here to surrender like
[17:46] him and he said that uh the spirit is
[17:50] willing but the flesh is weak so here

[35:43] good to see everyone in the house of the
[35:45] Lord today um it's a it's a bit of a odd
[35:49] day I'd say just uh some of the things
[35:52] that have happened I I
[35:53] mentioned on uh on my WhatsApp broadcast
[35:57] that that um that there were some
[35:59] articles coming out just about uh some
[36:02] of the the various churches number one
[36:05] is Golden Dawn Tabernacle and uh I know
[36:09] that there are many of you that have uh
[36:12] maybe some roots in that church and um I
[36:17] uh brothers and sisters I've heard
[36:19] pastors say oh don't don't read that
[36:23] stuff if you want to read it read it
[36:26] what are you afraid of I'm not afraid of
[36:28] anything I'm proud of of my walk with
[36:31] the Lord Jesus I'm proud of our church
[36:34] and there's no fear in in me I'm doing
[36:37] my best to teach this book and and I
[36:40] want to stay with it um then this
[36:44] morning this came out on the on the
[36:49] front page of our newspaper
[36:51] here and uh I haven't read it but I
[36:54] assume it's it's what has been on the uh
[36:57] on the Facebook
[36:58] page um it says readymade for abuse
[37:02] fringed Christian SE sect Sprouts dis
[37:06] destructive Cults
[37:08] worldwide you know one of the things
[37:11] about this when brother Brandon was
[37:14] alive he was on the front page of many
[37:17] newspapers but there was no Scandal it
[37:20] was more saying that he got some of the
[37:22] biggest um religious gatherings that
[37:24] were ever in the United States or or
[37:28] tens of thousands of people in South
[37:30] Africa and all of these testimonies and
[37:33] I ask now it's led to
[37:38] this after he's dead been gone for
[37:42] decades
[37:43] why why has it come to this when he was
[37:47] here it was Miracles and and wonders and
[37:52] and praises and and unity and and now
[37:56] something's changed
[37:58] let me tell you it's not this man's
[38:01] fault and another re another thing that
[38:03] I say I don't think it's even the
[38:04] reporter's fault that that post that
[38:07] that wrote this they don't
[38:09] know something has changed and I ask you
[38:13] and you can ask yourself what has
[38:15] changed why is now this name associated
[38:20] with
[38:21] Scandal and before it was associated
[38:23] with
[38:24] truth what's happened since he's been
[38:27] gone what's happened something that that
[38:31] we need to consider in ourselves we need
[38:33] to we need to ask that
[38:35] question what has
[38:38] happened it's not his
[38:42] fault I tell you if you want to hear
[38:44] what he said listen to
[38:47] him because of all these strange things
[38:49] that have popped up and and and led
[38:52] people astray and cause hurt and cause
[38:55] problems and it was not his
[39:00] fault I hold the newspaper up this
[39:02] morning's newspaper and it is
[39:06] Scandal what has happened in the past 60
[39:08] years 70 years that has hurt
[39:14] people what has happened and I think we
[39:17] should ask ourselves that that and and
[39:19] read those articles if you want to read
[39:21] them and you'll see you know I read I
[39:24] read them and it's like you know I don't
[39:26] agree with that
[39:28] and uh this I read them because there's
[39:30] people here that that have come from um
[39:35] that church that uh has um have suffered
[39:40] in certain
[39:42] ways
[39:43] um
[39:45] but
[39:47] my
[39:49] God who we just prayed to is Jesus
[39:53] Christ and I believe that same Jesus
[39:55] Christ LED brother brandom when he
[39:56] preached from this this very pulpit and
[39:58] this very building I believe it was the
[40:00] same God I believe it was the same God
[40:03] that healed the sick 2,000 years ago
[40:05] that healed the sick 3,000 4,000 years
[40:08] ago it's the same God that healed the
[40:10] sick 60 70 years ago God hasn't changed
[40:14] he loves us he loves people he heals the
[40:17] sick he he he he he saves the Lost he
[40:22] hasn't changed but we take things and we
[40:26] change them I'm going to be teaching on
[40:29] the Book of James today and we're going
[40:31] to start in a series I don't know how
[40:32] long I'm going to get into James chapter
[40:36] 1 but it's it's a tremendous book the
[40:39] book of James is is a book that that is
[40:44] not so much teaching us who Jesus is
[40:49] like most of the other Epistles like the
[40:50] APO like the uh the gospels the Book of
[40:55] James is teaching us now that you know
[40:59] now put it into
[41:01] action it's the next level and I thought
[41:05] for our church and as I'm praying about
[41:07] Lord what what do you want me to bring
[41:09] how can I how can I bless the people how
[41:12] can I get them closer to you how can I
[41:14] get that relationship better between you
[41:17] and them and it's time maybe to take a
[41:22] step forward in our lives take a step
[41:25] forward as a church
[41:28] and and put these things that we've
[41:30] learned put them into practice into your
[41:32] personal
[41:33] life this book of James it was
[41:36] written by by all accounts uh it was
[41:39] written by the half brother of the Lord
[41:43] Jesus and uh there's there's James that
[41:46] um we watched The Chosen last night
[41:48] there's the James and the chosen there's
[41:50] going to be a couple of them and uh no
[41:52] it's not it's not those Brothers it's
[41:54] not the disciples it's not there's
[41:56] another brother there's another James
[41:57] mentioned in the book of Acts this is
[42:00] most likely and almost Surly the half
[42:03] brother of Jesus
[42:05] Christ it's
[42:07] um the probably the son of Mary and
[42:10] Joseph now the Catholic Church te
[42:12] teaches that Mary was a Perpetual virgin
[42:16] she she um married Joseph but she stayed
[42:18] a virgin for the rest of her life um I
[42:22] don't necessarily think that that's
[42:24] that's right I think that Joseph and
[42:26] Mary probably had children afterwards
[42:28] because the Bible names that is this not
[42:31] Jesus who is the brother of of these
[42:33] ones James is one of them and he even
[42:35] had at least one sister that we know of
[42:39] so this this James is not only the
[42:42] brother of Jesus but he is also the
[42:47] pastor of the very first Christian
[42:50] Church that was ever
[42:51] formed this church at Jerusalem and
[42:55] James was the pastor he was a man of
[42:57] great
[42:58] Authority and he writes this book it's
[43:01] probably this epistle is probably the
[43:04] very first epistle ever written that we
[43:07] have record of it's it's before Paul's
[43:10] Epistles predates those the earliest
[43:12] epistle probably two or three years and
[43:15] it's it's sent to these people that have
[43:20] already accepted Jesus Christ as their
[43:22] savior they he's it's his audience is
[43:25] Jewish people that have given their life
[43:28] to the Lord Jesus we would call them
[43:30] maybe they Messianic Jews or back then
[43:34] maybe Jews that were converted they were
[43:36] the first converts in the anyways they
[43:38] were the first Believers of Jesus were
[43:40] the Jewish people and this is who that
[43:43] book is written to it's not WR written
[43:46] to the
[43:47] novice it's written to to people that
[43:51] that are anchored they're anchored in
[43:55] the word of God and and they're Anchored
[43:58] In Jesus Christ they have given their
[43:59] lives over to to the Lord now there's
[44:02] this man that we all know named Martin
[44:05] Luther who uh over 500 years ago he uh
[44:11] was a was a great great man of God As We
[44:14] Know Martin Luther's opinion of the Book
[44:17] of James was that it shouldn't even be
[44:22] included in the
[44:24] Bible he U he called
[44:27] um the the straw epistle I believe is is
[44:31] what he called it basically that it
[44:34] wasn't
[44:35] inspired and the reason that Martin
[44:38] Luther said that this book of James
[44:41] wasn't inspired the reason that I think
[44:43] is because it didn't match his
[44:46] Doctrine now remember Martin Luther was
[44:50] a great man and a uh a a great scholar
[44:56] of the world the word far greater than
[44:58] I'll ever be but well when I say
[45:04] but three letter letter
[45:07] word is the whole definition of that
[45:10] three-letter word is to contradict what
[45:12] you just
[45:14] said now I'm a Christian
[45:18] but now I like going to church
[45:22] but I like this person but now this
[45:25] person's a very nice person
[45:28] but and here here is my take on Martin
[45:31] Luther he was a great scholar of garden
[45:33] far better than I I could ever be
[45:37] but he was wrong on this
[45:41] and he what had happened is Martin
[45:44] Luther came out of the Catholic Church
[45:47] the Catholic church was a very much a
[45:49] works-based
[45:51] religion and it was that you can pay for
[45:55] what they called Indulgence or you can
[45:57] you can pay for your sins you can do so
[45:59] many Hail Maries and and have those sins
[46:02] absolved it was it was Works based now
[46:05] the Catholics wouldn't say that but the
[46:07] proof is in the pudding it it is very
[46:09] much a works-based
[46:11] religion and Martin Luther says Hey I
[46:14] just came out of this stuff and now I'm
[46:17] reading this book of James and James is
[46:20] saying that you have to do that there
[46:22] has to be works it doesn't match my
[46:25] Doctrine so he just threw it out and we
[46:28] have to be careful in doing that just
[46:31] because something may not match our
[46:33] Doctrine may not agree with the way that
[46:36] we've learned we don't do like Luther
[46:37] didn't just throw it out pray about it
[46:40] set aside you you're you're thinking and
[46:43] say Lord what what is this now Martin
[46:45] Luther we don't throw out what Martin
[46:47] Luther did he was the greatest man of
[46:49] his age I mean he wrote a list of 95
[46:53] things of how the Catholic church was
[46:55] wrong he wrote put him down took it and
[46:59] nailed it to the
[47:01] church great man and every one of those
[47:04] 95 things that that I see it I agree
[47:07] with every single one that he
[47:10] wrote but Martin
[47:15] Luther I didn't want my sermon to be
[47:18] about that
[47:20] word
[47:22] but I got to stop saying that and
[47:28] now I forgot what I was going to
[47:33] say but Martin Luther said that the Jews
[47:36] were the
[47:38] Antichrist I don't agree with
[47:41] that Martin Luther said many things
[47:44] Martin Luther was a firm hardcore
[47:49] trinitarian so it was John
[47:52] Wesley I don't agree with that either
[47:56] but just because I don't agree with
[47:57] certain things that Martin Luther said I
[47:59] don't just throw out Martin
[48:01] Luther I don't just throw out what he
[48:04] did as I said one of the greatest men
[48:06] that has ever walked the Earth Martin
[48:07] Luther stood up for what was right in
[48:11] the the regime of the Catholic Church
[48:13] wanted to kill him wanted to burn him at
[48:15] the stake because he made a stand saying
[48:18] no you cannot these these prayers for
[48:21] the for your sins this is not
[48:24] right the just shall live by faith and
[48:28] not by works is what Martin Luther said
[48:30] we heard brother nol Johnson talk about
[48:33] habac um on Wednesday Martin Luther was
[48:36] quoting
[48:38] habac when he says the just shall live
[48:41] by faith and that was his
[48:43] Doctrine but I don't throw out Martin
[48:47] Luther's
[48:48] words just because his thoughts on the
[48:52] Jewish
[48:53] people or just because of his thoughts
[48:56] on the
[48:57] Trinity Martin Luther was still a great
[49:02] man and brothers and sisters we have to
[49:04] be
[49:06] careful like in this this
[49:10] article there are are
[49:13] things that have been done
[49:17] wrong but don't throw it all
[49:20] out I don't throw
[49:22] out Jesus
[49:25] Christ because of all the the priests
[49:27] that have molested
[49:29] children I don't throw out Martin
[49:33] Luther because he said that because the
[49:35] Jews crucified Jesus that they were the
[49:37] Antichrist I don't throw out John
[49:39] Wesley because he preached the father
[49:42] Son and Holy Ghost as the the Oneness of
[49:45] God I don't I don't throw those Brothers
[49:46] out because of that they did great
[49:49] things and we need to be careful that we
[49:52] don't just throw something out because
[49:55] you find something something wrong with
[49:58] it we are people every person that has
[50:02] ever walked this earth except for one
[50:04] makes
[50:05] mistakes everyone has aired everyone has
[50:09] done things wrong with the exception of
[50:12] the man Jesus Christ so don't throw
[50:16] things maybe that I say out because I
[50:20] might make a
[50:21] mistake look at my heart and look at
[50:25] look at what I say and look at my love
[50:28] for the
[50:29] congregation same thing with with with
[50:31] William brandom don't throw out what he
[50:34] said just because there there are some
[50:37] things that that may be perceived
[50:39] problems he was a great man of God and
[50:41] God honored him so don't don't the these
[50:46] things as I said brother
[50:50] brandom he was on the front page of many
[50:52] many
[50:53] newspapers 60 70 years ago
[50:57] and what has happened in all of that
[51:00] time because now his name is associated
[51:04] with Scandal and
[51:07] before his name was associated with
[51:10] healing with love with salvation think
[51:13] about that think about that if you if
[51:16] you read these articles think about why
[51:18] that has happened and think about my
[51:21] heart brothers and sisters let's get
[51:23] back to this book Let's Get get back to
[51:27] this this is what brother Brandon
[51:29] preached God honored it this is what
[51:33] Martin Luther preached God honored it
[51:36] this is what the Great Men of old have
[51:38] preached and God honored
[51:41] it that's why it's really important to
[51:43] me I really feel feel like the Lord has
[51:46] been working on my heart to Let's really
[51:50] dig in to many of these books of the
[51:53] Bible and this book of James it really
[51:56] is it is a powerful book people say well
[51:59] well well we're tied about just the ABCs
[52:01] we want to know algebra you want to know
[52:03] algebra we're going to hear it and
[52:05] that's the Book of James the ABCs always
[52:08] believe
[52:09] Christ that's when you you get you get
[52:13] introduced to the Lord Jesus and and he
[52:15] changes your life and then there is a
[52:18] time now don't just stay right there you
[52:22] don't just stop right there you keep
[52:25] going don't be satisfied with the person
[52:29] that you are don't be satisfied with
[52:32] your current walk with the Lord your
[52:34] life should be a journey of
[52:37] events that serve a purpose to make you
[52:40] a better Christian and a series of
[52:43] events that give you a better
[52:46] understanding of who God
[52:47] is that's how your life should
[52:50] be and when James is as he's going
[52:54] through he's telling
[52:57] his audience
[52:58] hey yeah you're good you've you've
[53:02] accepted the Lord you've been baptized
[53:04] you you've had an
[53:05] experience and now you need to step it
[53:08] up in your life he he talks about that
[53:11] in this first per this first um chapter
[53:15] and he also says and I hope that we get
[53:17] to it he also tells us
[53:20] that
[53:21] Temptation that's not a
[53:23] sin it's acting on the Temptation that's
[53:27] a sin and and he and he he says that
[53:30] just because you suffer
[53:32] trials also it doesn't make you
[53:34] righteous just because you're suffering
[53:36] trials but you can take those trials
[53:38] that you suffer and those trials will
[53:41] make you a better
[53:46] person the um James's goal as I said it
[53:51] really isn't to teach a new
[53:53] theology James's goal is to
[53:57] get into your personal life and to make
[54:02] you a better
[54:03] person I um we were talking I was
[54:05] talking with the um the kids last night
[54:09] um when after we watched The Chosen I
[54:11] want to I always want to see what uh
[54:14] what's on their mind and we were talking
[54:18] about how important worship is and and
[54:21] the different songs that that mean a lot
[54:24] to the kids and um one of the songs that
[54:28] came up is a song that that we sing
[54:31] often in church and it's um song I was
[54:34] made for more and I want to read the
[54:38] lyrics of that
[54:39] song and uh and let me see I really
[54:43] think that the brother who wrote this
[54:45] probably read the book of James it says
[54:47] this I know who I am because I know who
[54:52] you are thank you the cross of salvation
[54:56] was only the
[54:59] start pause there and think about that
[55:02] that line the cross of Salvation that
[55:05] was only the start so many
[55:08] times we stop right there you come to
[55:14] the altar you have an experience with
[55:16] God you give your life over to God and
[55:19] then your testimony stops right
[55:22] there this it should not this should be
[55:25] a journey
[55:26] this should be a constant infilling this
[55:29] should be constantly getting closer with
[55:31] God constantly moving forward because if
[55:33] you just stop right there if you just
[55:36] stop and know that Jesus Christ is a
[55:38] savior and he's God later on we're going
[55:40] to hear that James says yeah you know
[55:42] the Devils believe that
[55:44] also there's
[55:47] more says now I am chosen free and
[55:50] forgiven I have a future and it's worth
[55:52] a
[55:53] living cuz I wasn't made to be tending
[55:55] in graved
[55:56] I was called by name born and raised
[55:59] back to life again again I was made for
[56:04] more so why would I make a bed in my
[56:08] shame when a Fountain of Grace is
[56:10] running my
[56:11] way I know I am yours and I was made for
[56:16] more and if you want to see the theme of
[56:19] James we were we were made from more so
[56:24] the the James is saying now let's get
[56:27] moving with this book of James chapter 1
[56:32] verse
[56:33] one says this James a servant of God and
[56:36] of the Lord Jesus Christ to the 12
[56:38] tribes which are scattered abroad
[56:39] greetings so James's letter is to the
[56:42] Jews as I said to the Jews that have
[56:44] accepted Jesus as the Messiah and their
[56:47] atonement for sin so the sacrifice they
[56:49] know now that this sacrifice that that
[56:52] was made for all of these years now has
[56:55] been made once and for all with this
[56:58] sinless Lamb of God named Jesus they
[57:03] understand that and this it's this
[57:07] letter is sent out to the dispersion to
[57:11] the to these Jews that have gone out if
[57:13] you if you um were in our Bible study
[57:16] with the book of Acts you saw that
[57:18] there's all of these different groups of
[57:21] Jewish people throughout galatia and and
[57:24] and these different places and this
[57:26] letter is meant to go out to all of them
[57:29] I think it's beautiful that that this
[57:31] man James he knew that his letter was
[57:34] going to be copied and copied and copied
[57:36] and distributed and he has that much
[57:38] faith in what he wrote to send this to
[57:41] basically
[57:44] everyone um and it uh
[57:47] really that James is encouraging
[57:52] us and encouraging the the reader let's
[57:56] put this faith in action and I've said
[58:00] this
[58:01] before and I believe that the greatest
[58:05] deception that Satan has accomplished in
[58:08] this day is to be make people think that
[58:11] they are a Christian to think that they
[58:13] have received a new birth the baptism of
[58:15] the Holy Ghost when all they have done
[58:17] is they've had an experience or been
[58:19] baptized or made a
[58:21] confession I think that should make us
[58:23] all
[58:24] think Lord is that me me I believe that
[58:27] I did have an experience and I go back
[58:29] to that experience but Lord did my
[58:32] testimony stop at that experience or has
[58:35] it moved
[58:38] forward there's
[58:41] a in my house in Jeffersonville um there
[58:46] was a place that was by the back door
[58:49] and under the stairwell that um plant
[58:52] grass in my backyard and I mow my grass
[58:55] and the grass would never grow in that
[58:57] spot and it would never grow in that
[59:00] spot because there was always it was
[59:01] always in the shade even in the middle
[59:03] of the summer in the middle of summer it
[59:04] would get a little bit of sun and it
[59:06] would come up a little bit but as soon
[59:07] as the days got a a little bit longer
[59:10] the the grass would die there and it's
[59:12] because it never was in the right
[59:15] atmosphere to grow it never got Sun it
[59:19] was the same grass over here but that's
[59:21] with with a Christian you have to be in
[59:24] the right atmosphere to grow
[59:26] you have to put yourself in that right
[59:29] atmosphere to open your arms and let
[59:31] this Sun come down and and grow that
[59:38] seed when a Temptation or trial comes
[59:42] along all of a
[59:46] sudden it's there's death there there's
[59:48] no more it just when the when the
[59:51] darkness is there it just falls apart my
[59:54] brethren counter all joy when you fall
[59:57] into diverse Temptations knowing this
[59:59] that the trying of your faith worketh
[1:00:02] patience but let patience have her
[1:00:05] perfect work that you may be perfect and
[1:00:07] entire wanting nothing a temptation is
[1:00:11] sin Jesus himself a Temptation I'm sorry
[1:00:16] a temptation is not sin Jesus himself
[1:00:20] the Son of God was tempted in every
[1:00:23] manner of sin yet he always overcame
[1:00:26] unlike us he was tempted by Satan
[1:00:29] himself in the
[1:00:31] wilderness his enemies talked about his
[1:00:34] mother accused her of sleeping with a
[1:00:37] Roman soldier and that's how Jesus was
[1:00:40] was
[1:00:41] conceived is what they said I mean you
[1:00:44] couldn't you couldn't insult a young
[1:00:46] lady more than that not only was it was
[1:00:49] it um having a a child out of wedlock
[1:00:52] and and sleeping around before wedlock
[1:00:54] but it was sleeping with a very unclean
[1:00:58] person called a gentile called a
[1:01:02] heathen accused his mother of horrible
[1:01:05] things and yet he kept his
[1:01:08] testimony he suffered sickness he
[1:01:10] suffered pain he felt emotion when his
[1:01:12] friend Lazarus died and yet he never
[1:01:15] sinned he overcame every
[1:01:18] Temptation and when we now James is
[1:01:21] saying and Jesus also now when we feel
[1:01:25] that same tempt temption we are required
[1:01:28] to also overcome that
[1:01:32] Temptation and it's not brothers and
[1:01:34] sisters as I said feeling the Temptation
[1:01:36] isn't sin but it's acting on that
[1:01:39] Temptation I'm going to get to that that
[1:01:41] shortly let's go to um let's just
[1:01:44] continue on back to James 1 um if any of
[1:01:47] you lack wisdom let him ask of God that
[1:01:50] giveth all men that giveth to all men
[1:01:52] liberally and abrath not and it shall be
[1:01:55] given him now James's writing style it's
[1:01:57] often called the New Testament Book of
[1:01:59] Proverbs James's writing style is he's
[1:02:02] kind of all over the place but he's
[1:02:04] great for onliners just like Proverbs is
[1:02:07] so so with James you can a lot of times
[1:02:10] take him out of context and just quote
[1:02:13] it and a lot of the the the things that
[1:02:16] James said should be put into our
[1:02:18] memories and and remembered that we can
[1:02:21] use those later
[1:02:22] on so he's saying here let patience feed
[1:02:26] your growth in the Lord and let's go
[1:02:31] back let's go to to let's go to verse
[1:02:33] five now if any of you lack wisdom let
[1:02:36] him ask of God that giveth to all men
[1:02:38] liberally and abrath not and it shall be
[1:02:41] given to him so he's saying let patience
[1:02:44] feed your growth in the Lord and if you
[1:02:47] lack wisdom if you lack if your lack of
[1:02:50] wisdom hinders your walk with the Lord
[1:02:52] if you say something wrong all of the
[1:02:55] time
[1:02:56] you're constantly saying things that you
[1:02:59] regret and you need to learn to be quiet
[1:03:02] rather than opening your mouth which is
[1:03:05] many many the time many the case of of
[1:03:08] all of of many of us then pray for these
[1:03:13] things Abraham Lincoln it was sometimes
[1:03:15] it's a tested Abraham Lincoln sometimes
[1:03:17] Mark Twain but but it's said this it's
[1:03:20] better to remain silent and be thought a
[1:03:23] fool than to speak and remove move all
[1:03:27] doubt so
[1:03:30] we it is best many times to remain
[1:03:34] silent and if you keep making the same
[1:03:36] mistake and you keep praying that God
[1:03:37] deliver you from making this mistake
[1:03:39] then there's something wrong with your
[1:03:42] prayer that if you're not willing to do
[1:03:45] it if you just say well Lord I I'm just
[1:03:46] trying just I'm asking the Lord to
[1:03:48] deliver me from always saying foolish
[1:03:50] things or I'm asking the Lord to deliver
[1:03:51] me from always losing my temper well
[1:03:54] what are you doing about it
[1:03:57] you're asking the Lord with no faith
[1:03:59] come on you have something to do you
[1:04:03] just are feeling bad because you do the
[1:04:05] same thing over and over it's not God's
[1:04:08] fault you need to step up the Bible says
[1:04:11] that he won't tempt you greater than you
[1:04:13] can bear so there's no temptation that
[1:04:16] can come to you that you are not able to
[1:04:23] reject and then when the Temptation
[1:04:25] Rises to speak foolishly or to make a
[1:04:28] decision that you haven't prayed through
[1:04:30] to to maybe make a purchase that you
[1:04:32] shouldn't make have Hazard Le or to to
[1:04:35] quit a job just be patient hold your
[1:04:38] tongue and let patience have her perfect
[1:04:43] work I know the high pressure sales all
[1:04:46] of us have been there their tactic is
[1:04:50] don't let this guy get out of the office
[1:04:52] or on the phone without giving you the
[1:04:54] credit card
[1:04:56] and that's what they want to say they're
[1:04:57] constantly saying well you know this my
[1:04:59] boss said that that this is a mistake
[1:05:01] and this deal is just for
[1:05:04] today just wait or this Black Friday
[1:05:07] deal man it's like I want that thing so
[1:05:09] bad and look at the good deal I I just I
[1:05:11] just want to buy it be careful let
[1:05:12] patience have perfect work you don't
[1:05:14] have to have it right now just wait pray
[1:05:17] about it and then make a a well-informed
[1:05:21] decision but let him ask in faith not
[1:05:23] wavering nothing wavering for he that
[1:05:26] wavereth is like a wave of the sea
[1:05:28] driven with the wind and
[1:05:31] tossed if you're not asking in
[1:05:34] faith you're throwing out an insincere
[1:05:38] prayer really it's being a lazy
[1:05:41] Christian that you're just constantly
[1:05:43] putting these things on God and and you
[1:05:47] have to stop for a minute and sometimes
[1:05:49] time will go
[1:05:52] on and you'll be praying you'll be
[1:05:54] praying about something Lord Lord I I
[1:05:56] want to I want to stop doing this or I
[1:05:58] want you to help me doing this a year
[1:06:00] will pass by and then sometimes it's 10
[1:06:03] years and then 20 years and 30 years and
[1:06:06] you're going to be 40 50 60 years old
[1:06:09] and you're still praying about the same
[1:06:11] things that you prayed about when you
[1:06:13] were a kid and you're still making the
[1:06:14] same mistakes it's because the prayers
[1:06:18] that are going up are going up without
[1:06:20] faith you're not willing to do your
[1:06:24] part and not do these
[1:06:29] things let's continue on with
[1:06:33] James James
[1:06:35] 1:6 the um English Standard Version says
[1:06:39] this but let him ask in faith with no
[1:06:41] doubting for the one who doubts is like
[1:06:43] a wave of the sea that is driven and
[1:06:45] tossed by the wind he's all over the
[1:06:47] place when he's asking these things he's
[1:06:50] serving God and then he's sinning and
[1:06:53] then he's serving God again and then
[1:06:54] he's sinning I knew a guy that that was
[1:06:57] uh this guy was one of the best people
[1:07:00] that I've ever met in being able to
[1:07:02] remember the scriptures and give and and
[1:07:05] quote scriptures and apply scriptures to
[1:07:07] certain things and he'd always anytime
[1:07:09] there was a group of people after church
[1:07:11] he was always there and he was always
[1:07:12] the one after service really preaching
[1:07:15] and and really talking and and quoting
[1:07:17] the scriptures and and really putting
[1:07:19] them together well and then he would
[1:07:20] come up missing for a
[1:07:23] month and then
[1:07:26] he'd come back and everybody'd be like
[1:07:28] well where's I'm not going to say his
[1:07:30] name but where you wouldn't know him but
[1:07:31] where is this guy you know he's he's
[1:07:33] been um I haven't seen him in a while
[1:07:36] and then it came out that the brother
[1:07:39] was a meth
[1:07:41] addict and he would go on these binges
[1:07:44] and be out for a while and lose 20 or 30
[1:07:47] pounds and then come back what good was
[1:07:51] his Doctrine when he had that sin in his
[1:07:54] life if it was like a it was like a boat
[1:07:56] just being tossed and and turned in the
[1:07:58] wind he he was back and and forth and do
[1:08:01] you think his Doctrine was sound with
[1:08:04] this sin in his life it
[1:08:05] wasn't for let not that man let not that
[1:08:09] man think that he shall receive anything
[1:08:11] of
[1:08:13] God you're up and you're
[1:08:15] down but you can't expect your prayers
[1:08:17] to be answered because you're not
[1:08:19] praying with
[1:08:21] faith verse number eight a double-minded
[1:08:25] man
[1:08:26] is unstable in all his ways it means
[1:08:29] that not only are you double-minded when
[1:08:32] you can't control your temper when you
[1:08:34] can't control your tongue but you're
[1:08:37] also double-minded in your prayers
[1:08:39] you're double-minded in your spiritual
[1:08:42] walk just as you're double-minded in
[1:08:45] your natural walk says here you're
[1:08:47] double- minded in all of your ways it
[1:08:49] doesn't say just in in your sin just in
[1:08:51] the world if there is sin in your life
[1:08:54] if you're constantly going back to the
[1:08:56] same well of sin that
[1:08:59] double-mindedness manifests itself in
[1:09:02] all of your
[1:09:04] ways first Peter I'll read 1 Peter
[1:09:08] chapter 4 verse
[1:09:09] 1 for as much then as Christ has
[1:09:12] suffered for us in the flesh arm
[1:09:15] yourselves likewise with the same mind
[1:09:18] the same mind as what it's the same mind
[1:09:20] as
[1:09:22] Christ the NIV translation says
[1:09:26] arm yourself with the same attitude as
[1:09:29] Christ ESV says the same way of thinking
[1:09:32] as Christ for he hath suffered In the
[1:09:34] Flesh and has ceased from sin that he no
[1:09:36] longer should live the rest of his time
[1:09:39] in the flesh to the lusts of men but to
[1:09:41] the will of God for the time past of our
[1:09:44] life may suffice us to have wrought the
[1:09:48] will of the Gentiles when we walked in
[1:09:50] lasciviousness lust and excess of wine
[1:09:52] revelings banquetings and ab abominable
[1:09:55] idolatries all of these things that are
[1:09:57] sin you you're
[1:09:59] double-minded that's not the mind of
[1:10:01] Christ wherein they think that it's
[1:10:03] strange that you run not with them to
[1:10:06] the same excess of Riot speaking evil of
[1:10:10] you so you don't sin anymore you don't
[1:10:12] do these things wrong anymore so then
[1:10:14] people think you're weird because you
[1:10:16] don't do it anymore they think it's
[1:10:20] strange who shall give account to him
[1:10:24] that is ready to judge the quick and the
[1:10:27] dead time cycle let's go back to
[1:10:30] James let not the brother of low
[1:10:33] degree rejoice in that he is
[1:10:38] exalted but the rich in that he is made
[1:10:41] low because as the flower of the grass
[1:10:44] he shall pass away I'm gonna I'm going
[1:10:47] to um go through this this fairly
[1:10:50] quickly because I want to get to the
[1:10:52] main point here in James but he's saying
[1:10:55] that
[1:10:56] that this rich man that may have have an
[1:10:58] e easy life and have all that he wants
[1:11:01] when he comes into hardship when trouble
[1:11:03] hits his life let him thank the Lord for
[1:11:06] it that he has had troubles that that he
[1:11:09] has made lower and then let the poor
[1:11:13] person also
[1:11:15] rejoice in that they have been chosen by
[1:11:20] God to believe his
[1:11:23] word what great G Rich riches could we
[1:11:27] have than be chosen to believe God's
[1:11:30] word there's no greater riches the rich
[1:11:33] man's up here and he's saying that Lord
[1:11:36] I Thank you for all my trials the rich
[1:11:38] Christian I thank you for all my trials
[1:11:40] I thank you what for what you've done
[1:11:41] for me because it humbled me and I look
[1:11:45] back and I'm a better person now that I
[1:11:46] went through this trial and the poor man
[1:11:49] is saying Lord thank you so much that
[1:11:51] you chose me to be one of your children
[1:11:54] to one of your your your
[1:11:59] Believers for the sun is no sooner risen
[1:12:02] with a burning heat but withereth the
[1:12:04] grass and the flower falleth therefore
[1:12:07] falleth and the grace of the fashion of
[1:12:08] it perisheth so also shall the rich man
[1:12:11] Fade Away in his bless in his ways
[1:12:14] blessed is the man that endureth
[1:12:16] Temptation for when he is tried he shall
[1:12:19] receive the Crown of Life which the Lord
[1:12:21] hath promised to them that love him let
[1:12:23] no man say when he is tempted I am
[1:12:25] tempted of God for God cannot be tempted
[1:12:29] with evil neither tempteth he any man
[1:12:32] but every man is tempted when he is
[1:12:34] drawn away key thing here when he is
[1:12:39] drawn away of his own lust and
[1:12:43] enticed then when lust hath
[1:12:45] conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin
[1:12:50] when it is finished bringeth forth
[1:12:53] death so mouthful
[1:12:57] there what he's saying is when you start
[1:13:02] entertaining these thoughts that are in
[1:13:05] your mind of sin whatever would be it
[1:13:08] might be adultery it might be a lie it
[1:13:11] might be hatred when you start
[1:13:14] entertaining these
[1:13:16] thoughts they eventually become no
[1:13:20] longer thoughts anymore they become
[1:13:23] Deeds d David King David he was up on
[1:13:27] his
[1:13:28] rooftop his warriors were out fighting a
[1:13:31] battle and David was out and he looked
[1:13:36] down and he saw a woman
[1:13:41] bathing and he he looked at her and
[1:13:44] there was the temptation of
[1:13:46] David wasn't sin yet there was the
[1:13:50] Temptation David should have turned his
[1:13:52] head and went back in but that
[1:13:56] Temptation started up in David and it
[1:13:58] was just like a little little
[1:14:02] spark and instead of going out and
[1:14:04] letting the spark go out David looked in
[1:14:07] the thoughts in David's mind he must
[1:14:10] have thought
[1:14:12] well been attracted to this woman he
[1:14:15] must have entertained the thoughts and
[1:14:19] then eventually those thoughts became
[1:14:23] deeds and he sent for her to come to him
[1:14:28] and the thoughts that were in David's
[1:14:31] mind manifested themselves into the
[1:14:35] actual act in
[1:14:38] sin and then When sin was
[1:14:43] mature then it it created more sin and
[1:14:48] David when when the husband of this this
[1:14:50] woman that he had an affair with he he
[1:14:52] brings him back
[1:14:55] and he wants to cover up what he
[1:14:58] did he sends the man the man won't
[1:15:01] follow what David David said to cover up
[1:15:04] his deeds with his wife and it was it
[1:15:07] was a she conceived when she had the
[1:15:09] affair with David and he brought the
[1:15:11] husband back so that they would think
[1:15:13] that it was his baby or he would think
[1:15:15] that it was his baby when he wouldn't do
[1:15:18] it when he wouldn't be with his wife
[1:15:20] David sent him back out and look at how
[1:15:22] that sin went into another sin and David
[1:15:26] had the man
[1:15:27] murdered and it was all from
[1:15:30] entertaining those thoughts and you you
[1:15:33] look at it and and you start it starts
[1:15:36] with just a little spark and you have
[1:15:39] some dry tendering there you're starting
[1:15:40] a fire and or or you just have a spark
[1:15:44] there and that spark is sin and if you
[1:15:46] would just let it go out if you just
[1:15:48] leave it it'll go out but instead your
[1:15:51] thoughts start going and you
[1:15:58] you start blowing on it those are your
[1:16:01] thoughts those are entertaining that sin
[1:16:04] in your mind could be hatred doesn't
[1:16:06] have to be adultery it could be anything
[1:16:09] right and you look and and you you're
[1:16:11] you're you're you're thinking about this
[1:16:13] and then maybe you you talk with your
[1:16:15] wife or with your husband or your
[1:16:18] brother or your sister and says you know
[1:16:19] this guy he he he did this to me and can
[1:16:22] you believe it it's just
[1:16:24] [Music]
[1:16:27] you're blowing on that fire you're
[1:16:30] putting the oxygen in it and you're
[1:16:32] you're just from the the Deeds that
[1:16:35] you're doing you're starting to make it
[1:16:37] grow and eventually it grows and it
[1:16:40] grows and it grows and it becomes a full
[1:16:42] flame and now you're full both feet into
[1:16:47] sin and that's where David was when he
[1:16:51] committed adultery it started with just
[1:16:53] Him looking
[1:16:56] he couldn't help that he saw he couldn't
[1:16:57] help that the Temptation was there that
[1:16:59] wasn't sin but when he let it go in his
[1:17:03] mind same thing with
[1:17:05] Cain Cain was upset at his as
[1:17:09] brother he he made his Altar and he had
[1:17:12] this beautiful Altar and Abel over here
[1:17:14] he had his Altar and God chose Abel's
[1:17:16] Altar and Cain was
[1:17:19] offended and it started in his
[1:17:22] mind and he let it s settle in his mind
[1:17:25] he let that hatred
[1:17:27] settle and there he is as he's thinking
[1:17:30] about it
[1:17:33] he's he's blowing on this fire and it's
[1:17:38] starting to build and then it manifests
[1:17:40] itself until he was so angry with his
[1:17:43] brother he was so jealous that he killed
[1:17:46] him Jesus
[1:17:48] said he said that if you just hate he
[1:17:54] said you you've talked about the law
[1:17:56] says that if you murder someone you are
[1:17:58] in danger of judgment he says that if
[1:18:00] you just hate your
[1:18:02] brother that you're in danger of that
[1:18:05] judgment he said that he said that yeah
[1:18:08] you've said that that you commit
[1:18:09] adultery and you're you are you have
[1:18:12] committed adultery and you're in danger
[1:18:14] of judgment he said but if you just
[1:18:18] want to have an affair on your
[1:18:21] spouse then you have committed adultery
[1:18:26] already you're allowing that to go in
[1:18:30] your
[1:18:30] mind you're giving it a place in your
[1:18:33] mind you're allowing the temptation to
[1:18:36] stay there and then as it goes it will
[1:18:39] build and build and build and then it
[1:18:42] will manifest itself in
[1:18:44] sin if you let those thoughts stay in
[1:18:48] your mind if you let that Temptation
[1:18:53] stay and that
[1:18:55] seed it'll remain
[1:18:57] dormant until it it sees the right
[1:19:00] conditions and then it'll Sprout the
[1:19:03] seed of sin it'll Sprout and then it has
[1:19:06] to have the right conditions to grow and
[1:19:10] that's when we as Sinners we give it the
[1:19:14] right condition to
[1:19:15] grow even if it sprouts cut it off right
[1:19:20] when you see it step away from it say
[1:19:24] Lord I'm sorry I was tempted by that I'm
[1:19:28] sorry I'm going to step away from it and
[1:19:31] as I said it could be talking it could
[1:19:34] be talking with your wife be on the way
[1:19:37] to church you know this person is really
[1:19:38] getting on my nerves or or this person
[1:19:41] said that and then you're just blowing
[1:19:43] on that
[1:19:45] fire and it's like well I should I
[1:19:47] should be able to talk to my
[1:19:49] wife you
[1:19:51] should but what are the words that
[1:19:53] you're saying
[1:19:55] is it maybe just blowing on the
[1:19:57] flame just don't say it just keep it
[1:20:01] back and keep it positive Philippians
[1:20:03] 4:7 says
[1:20:06] this in the peace of
[1:20:08] God which passees all understanding
[1:20:11] shall keep your hearts and Minds through
[1:20:13] Jesus Christ your hearts and your minds
[1:20:17] finally
[1:20:18] Brethren whatsoever things are true
[1:20:20] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[1:20:22] things are just whatsoever things are
[1:20:24] pure what ever things are lovely
[1:20:25] whatsoever things are of good report if
[1:20:27] there be any virtue and if there be any
[1:20:29] praise think on these
[1:20:32] things then James here he follows his
[1:20:36] statement he's giving us correction here
[1:20:38] he's saying let don't let these things
[1:20:39] grow he says let patience have her
[1:20:41] perfect work don't let these things grow
[1:20:43] in your mind and he redirects the focus
[1:20:46] from the things of evil now he goes to
[1:20:48] the things of God in verse 16 James
[1:20:51] chapter 1 he says don't Heir my beloved
[1:20:53] brethren
[1:20:54] every good gift and every perfect gift
[1:20:57] is from above and cometh down from the
[1:21:00] Father of Lights with whom is no
[1:21:03] variable neither shadow of turning of
[1:21:06] his own will begat he us with the word
[1:21:09] of
[1:21:10] truth that we should be a kind of first
[1:21:14] fruits of his creatures first fruits of
[1:21:17] his Creations that first fruits that is
[1:21:20] the first one to come ripe and he's
[1:21:23] saying that we should be those first
[1:21:25] ones to come right that we should be an
[1:21:27] example to others we we've talked before
[1:21:30] about the wave
[1:21:31] sheath the offering that was made I
[1:21:34] believe it's in Leviticus where the
[1:21:35] priest would take the first fruits of
[1:21:37] the Harvest and he'd wave it before the
[1:21:39] people and he's saying now this is
[1:21:40] what's to come Harvest is getting rip
[1:21:44] and that's how Jesus Christ was when he
[1:21:46] came he healed the sick and he and he
[1:21:49] treated people with love and he
[1:21:52] respected he respected the word and put
[1:21:54] the word into action and then the
[1:21:56] disciples did the same thing and here
[1:21:58] James is saying now we're the first
[1:22:00] fruits now you do
[1:22:06] this wherefore my beloved Brethren let
[1:22:10] every man be swift to hear slow to speak
[1:22:13] slow to wrath for the wrath of man
[1:22:16] worketh not righteous worketh not the
[1:22:18] righteousness of God anytime we lose our
[1:22:23] temper no no matter if you are right or
[1:22:26] wrong the anger of man does not work the
[1:22:31] righteousness of God
[1:22:34] never the Bible says that we should do
[1:22:36] nothing through Strife or vain
[1:22:40] Glory wherefore lay apart all filthiness
[1:22:44] and superfluity of naughty naughtiness
[1:22:47] and receive with meekness the engrafted
[1:22:49] word which is able to save your souls
[1:22:51] that's that's old English let me let me
[1:22:54] read the NIV it says this therefore get
[1:22:56] rid of all moral filth and evil that is
[1:23:00] so prevalent and humbly accept the word
[1:23:02] planted in you which can save
[1:23:05] you the seed that I mentioned
[1:23:09] earlier it can be the seed of God or it
[1:23:14] can be the seed of the devil the little
[1:23:16] fire that I was talking about earlier
[1:23:19] that can either be God's seed that's in
[1:23:21] us or it could be that Temptation that's
[1:23:23] there and and you're going to see which
[1:23:26] one are you going to feed which one are
[1:23:28] are you going to put the the the fuel on
[1:23:30] which one are you going to give the
[1:23:32] oxygen to instead of of blowing on that
[1:23:37] fire that
[1:23:39] sin turn and start blowing on the fire
[1:23:43] that's from
[1:23:44] God start talking in the Right Way start
[1:23:49] praying start reading your Bible and
[1:23:51] then
[1:23:52] you then you are blowing and starting
[1:23:56] that
[1:23:57] fire for if any be a hearer of the
[1:24:01] word and not a doer he is like unto a
[1:24:04] man beholding his natural face face in a
[1:24:06] glass that word glass is mirror for he
[1:24:09] beholdeth himself and goeth his way and
[1:24:11] straightway
[1:24:19] forgetthe know what what the pastor said
[1:24:21] that's right I'm doing that wrong I need
[1:24:23] to do a better
[1:24:24] job or you you'll come to a revelation
[1:24:27] say I need to do I need to step it up in
[1:24:29] my life and this way and this way and
[1:24:31] this way and then after after that
[1:24:33] happens like this morning I looked at I
[1:24:35] looked in the mirror and I was like wow
[1:24:37] my beard matches my
[1:24:41] suit and there I am standing and I I I
[1:24:44] forgot totally what I look
[1:24:47] like my thoughts are on something
[1:24:50] else and that's how we are when we look
[1:24:53] in this face of the go El when we look
[1:24:55] at at this face that it's in God's
[1:24:57] mirror and we see
[1:25:00] fault and we are condemned and we repent
[1:25:04] don't just leave and let that fade away
[1:25:07] and he's saying here that beholdeth he
[1:25:09] goeth his way and straight way he
[1:25:11] forgets what manner of man he
[1:25:14] was he forgets that sinner that he
[1:25:17] saw in church he forgets that sinner
[1:25:21] that he saw crying at the altar
[1:25:24] he forgets that
[1:25:26] person and he just goes right back
[1:25:29] slowly into the world and then looking
[1:25:33] in that in God's mirror didn't really
[1:25:36] take an
[1:25:39] effect but who so lookth into the
[1:25:41] perfect law of
[1:25:43] Liberty and continueth therein he being
[1:25:46] not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the
[1:25:48] work this man shall be blessed in his
[1:25:51] deed not just a hearer but a doer of the
[1:25:55] work this man shall be blessed in what
[1:25:58] he's doing if any man among you seem to
[1:26:01] be religious then bridleth not his
[1:26:02] tongue but Bridle not his tongue but
[1:26:05] deceiveth his own heart this man's
[1:26:07] religion is vain same thing if you're if
[1:26:10] you're going about and and you see
[1:26:12] yourself and you see your faults and
[1:26:14] then you go right back and do them what
[1:26:17] good is your religion it's not doing any
[1:26:18] good it's vain
[1:26:25] pure
[1:26:26] religion and undefiled as this I love so
[1:26:30] I said I compared James to Proverbs and
[1:26:33] Solomon's writing I believe is
[1:26:35] Ecclesiastes Solomon says that this is
[1:26:38] the conclusion of the matter this is
[1:26:41] what it all means and here is the
[1:26:43] conclusion of the matter for the first
[1:26:46] chapter of the Book of
[1:26:48] James and it's not something that's hard
[1:26:51] to understand it's not something that
[1:26:54] you have to be a scholar to get to it's
[1:26:58] very
[1:26:59] simple pure
[1:27:01] religion and undefiled defiled before
[1:27:04] God and the father is this to visit the
[1:27:07] fatherless and the widows in their
[1:27:09] Affliction and to keep himself unspotted
[1:27:12] from the
[1:27:14] world God has a special place in his
[1:27:16] heart for those that don't have
[1:27:20] parents God has a special place in his
[1:27:22] heart for those that don't have a dad
[1:27:25] don't forget about these young people
[1:27:26] don't forget about those that don't have
[1:27:29] both parents they were born into this
[1:27:32] situation this isn't a situation that
[1:27:34] they put themselves into reach out to
[1:27:37] those people James is saying right here
[1:27:39] he says pure pure religion is this to go
[1:27:42] to those people because they need
[1:27:45] help they need somebody to to put the
[1:27:48] arm around them they need somebody to
[1:27:50] give them a kind
[1:27:52] word they need this as I said they
[1:27:55] didn't put themselves in this situation
[1:27:57] and also to the widows God loves the
[1:28:00] widows why they didn't put themselves in
[1:28:03] that situation either at least most of
[1:28:09] them
[1:28:13] kidding they didn't put themselves in
[1:28:15] that situation either it wasn't their
[1:28:19] fault and they God wants us to reach out
[1:28:23] to those people
[1:28:24] he wants us to help the sisters give
[1:28:27] them a call
[1:28:29] sometime you know give them a dinner
[1:28:32] every once in a while in their
[1:28:34] honor give them some love tell them how
[1:28:37] much you appreciate them because they
[1:28:38] are important and they needed as I said
[1:28:41] they didn't create this
[1:28:43] situation and it's going to be said for
[1:28:46] for pretty much
[1:28:48] everything do something help these
[1:28:50] people that need
[1:28:52] help pure religion is
[1:28:56] this pure religion and undefiled before
[1:28:59] God and the father is to visit the the
[1:29:01] father fatherless and the widows in
[1:29:03] their Affliction to help those that need
[1:29:06] help and to give him and to keep himself
[1:29:09] unspotted from the world don't get
[1:29:13] caught
[1:29:14] up when those Temptations come into your
[1:29:19] mind don't let them stay don't get
[1:29:22] caught up into that don't give it a
[1:29:24] place in your mind don't let it manifest
[1:29:26] itself because one day that Temptation
[1:29:29] that you're allowing
[1:29:31] there one
[1:29:33] day it'll strike to
[1:29:35] life one day it'll start
[1:29:38] up and then you've fallen into
[1:29:42] sin and then it'll spread around you as
[1:29:46] it did with David musicians can come and
[1:29:48] we'll
[1:29:52] close James says
[1:29:54] I'll read another translation New Living
[1:29:56] Translation says this pure and genuine
[1:29:58] religion in the sight of
[1:30:01] God the father means caring for Orphans
[1:30:04] and widows in their distress and
[1:30:06] refusing to let the world corrupt you
[1:30:10] it's a simple
[1:30:12] gospel that's that's the the basis
[1:30:15] that's the meaning that's the conclusion
[1:30:16] of the matter that's the sum of all
[1:30:19] things serve God trust God serve his
[1:30:23] people and stay away from
[1:30:26] sin and this book of James I believe is
[1:30:29] is perfect timing that we are starting
[1:30:33] in this book of James and we
[1:30:35] see this newspaper article come out
[1:30:38] right now I mentioned it to you a couple
[1:30:40] weeks ago I said that they're they're
[1:30:41] starting to come out
[1:30:45] and if you read
[1:30:48] them maybe pray for those people that
[1:30:50] have been
[1:30:51] hurt but I'll tell you right now
[1:30:55] it's not brother Brandon it's not him
[1:30:58] that did those things it's not it's
[1:30:59] these scandals aren't from him these
[1:31:01] scandals are come from people that have
[1:31:06] taken the word and have Twisted it to
[1:31:10] serve themselves and to cause and have
[1:31:12] caused problems I'm not condemning
[1:31:14] anybody I don't know any of these people
[1:31:16] that are mentioned in these
[1:31:19] articles but I'm just what I'm saying is
[1:31:22] the one thing I do know for sure
[1:31:25] is the man that is featured on the front
[1:31:28] of this
[1:31:30] newspaper has been on the front of many
[1:31:33] many newspapers in the
[1:31:35] past and it was always a good
[1:31:38] thing and
[1:31:40] now anytime he's featured it's always a
[1:31:43] scandalous thing it's not his fault it's
[1:31:47] people that have gotten off of the word
[1:31:50] and presented the gospel in a way that
[1:31:52] isn't right
[1:31:54] and with
[1:31:58] James don't let the seed or the
[1:32:03] Ember Don't Let It Grow don't let a
[1:32:08] Temptation come into your mind you may
[1:32:10] want to you may say well I read these
[1:32:13] articles and I want to leave my church
[1:32:15] or I want to I want to just forsake all
[1:32:17] that don't forsake
[1:32:20] Christ stay with the Lord Jesus pray
[1:32:24] about it and and and choose a church
[1:32:29] that gets you closer to him a church
[1:32:33] that will stand upon the gospel and
[1:32:35] really stand upon the same thing that
[1:32:37] brother brandom stood on that's what's
