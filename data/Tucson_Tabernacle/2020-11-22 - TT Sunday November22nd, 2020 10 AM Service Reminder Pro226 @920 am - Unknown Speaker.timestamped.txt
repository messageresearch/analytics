[41:17] je God
[41:23] Al Prince of
[41:27] [Music]
[41:32] TR
[41:36] man and hearts are
[41:43] maned in the
[41:49] [Music]
[41:53] presence Heal Me Oh Lord Heal Me Oh Lord
[41:57] Lord how many know you ask and believe
[42:00] God keeps his word amen how many can
[42:02] testify that God keeps his word Heal Me
[42:07] Oh
[42:08] Lord and I will be
[42:14] heal save me and I will be
[42:25] saved heal me me oh
[42:30] Lord and I will be
[42:35] here for you are the
[42:40] one I
[42:43] [Applause]
[42:45] praise you are the
[42:50] one I
[42:55] praise to God be all glory and all
[42:58] praise for he's the one that did
[43:01] everything that was
[43:03] necessary everything was fulfilled and
[43:05] taken care of when he said it is
[43:08] finished it was finished so appreciate
[43:12] that we do
[43:13] have a couple of requests
[43:17] to brother Ed dugall said he'd
[43:20] appreciate the prayers of the Saints as
[43:22] he will be having
[43:23] surgery to replace his half lipped uh
[43:27] his left hip I'll get it right on
[43:32] Tuesday praying God will guide the all
[43:36] things and uh and speedy recovery so you
[43:40] know God has done amazing things through
[43:43] the hands of doctors through the hands
[43:46] of of people like us but he's also done
[43:49] things without a human hand touching but
[43:52] he's gone in there and just done it
[43:54] himself he can Speak Life where there's
[43:57] death he can restore broken limbs broken
[44:01] bones complete healing without a doctor
[44:03] touching so what God desires to do we'll
[44:06] believe that together so also today we
[44:11] heard and uh sister Kelly Batman who we
[44:15] know had been sick quite some time and
[44:17] sister Kelly and the Batman family
[44:18] attended the Tabernacle for many years
[44:21] but sister Kelly has passed away and
[44:23] gone over to the other side
[44:25] so she's well
[44:28] she's happy she's a young lady again
[44:32] she's in a place that we're all Desiring
[44:34] to be so there's that part for the
[44:37] family that's left Scott and sister
[44:40] Wanda and Mom and I know Ben had had
[44:44] gone over already and and stuff but we
[44:47] remember the Batman family at this time
[44:49] but for sister Kelly she's where we
[44:52] desire to be today so in that part we
[44:55] Rejoice but for the family we ask for
[44:57] God's mercy
[44:59] so brother Daryl Ward also mentioned to
[45:02] me that brother Tommy Diller passed away
[45:04] and we had known brother Tommy Diller
[45:07] many years ago had not heard of him
[45:09] anymore but he was a minister of the
[45:10] gospel and he mentioned to me that
[45:13] brother Tommy Diller he passed away and
[45:14] he took Memories Back to as a Young Man
[45:16] hearing brother Tommy Diller preach and
[45:18] Minister for us so there are people who
[45:21] today are hurting people who today are
[45:24] sad in in the sense of the loss of a l
[45:27] loved one but there are people who have
[45:29] lost a loved one whose hearts are have
[45:32] an assurance that all is well so we
[45:35] thank that God has been mindful to us as
[45:38] a family of God and appreciate it now

[55:57] that one
[55:59] month before that man ever knew that he
[56:02] had a
[56:03] question God done had the answer sitting
[56:06] beside him and that same God is in this
[56:08] building this morning that whatever you
[56:11] have need of or whatever you're facing
[56:12] your life he already knows all about it
[56:15] this morning and we can cast all of our
[56:17] Cares up on him because he cares for us

[56:52] if you want to join in with the service
[56:54] you're more than welcome to if you want

[56:59] morning that that you're just as much a
[57:01] part of the service as I am amen and he
[57:03] can move right among the pews as much as
[57:05] he can move from the platform so we just
[57:07] look to him this
[57:10] morning Second Kings want to read from 2
[57:12] Kings chapter 4 starting at verse
[57:16] 25 do you love
[57:18] him praise the
[57:20] Lord so she went and came into the man
[57:23] of God to Mount
[57:24] Carmel and it came to pass that when the
[57:27] man of God saw her a far off that he
[57:29] said to Gaza his servant behold Yonder
[57:32] is the
[57:33] shemite run now I pray thee to meet her
[57:36] and say unto her is it well with thee is
[57:39] it well with thy husband is it well with
[57:42] thy child and she answered it is
[57:48] well and when she came to the man of God
[57:50] to the hill she caught him by the feet
[57:53] but Caza came near to thrust her away
[57:56] and the man of God said let her
[57:58] alone for her soul is vexed within her
[58:01] and the Lord ha hid it from me and hath
[58:04] not told
[58:06] me then she
[58:08] said did I desire a son of my
[58:13] Lord did I not say Do not deceive
[58:17] me then he said to Gaza G up thy loins
[58:20] and take my staff in thy hand and go thy
[58:23] way and if thou meet any man salute him
[58:26] not and if any salute thee answer him
[58:28] not again and lay my staff upon the face
[58:31] of the
[58:33] child and the mother of the child said
[58:35] as the Lord liveth and as thy soul
[58:39] liveth I will not leave thee and he
[58:43] arose and followed
[58:46] her and he arose and followed her you
[58:50] know why because she would not leave him
[58:56] amen she would not let
[58:59] go let's bow our heads I want to speak
[59:02] to you for a few minutes this morning on
[59:04] hold
[59:06] on hold
[59:09] on almighty
[59:14] God thou who has raised Christ from the
[59:17] grave and sent the promise of the Holy
[59:21] Spirit into our
[59:23] hearts how we bow in your great presence
[59:27] this morning
[59:28] Lord knowing that thou art God and
[59:31] beside you there is none
[59:34] other and Lord we believe your word to
[59:37] be
[59:39] true Nations will fail us and political
[59:43] leaders will fail us and local
[59:45] governments will fail us but your word
[59:47] shall never fail us
[59:49] Lord so father we look to you this
[59:52] morning the author and finisher of our
[59:55] faith
[59:56] and we pray Lord that the same anointing
[59:59] that wrote the word would now move Upon
[1:00:01] Our Hearts to give us the divine
[1:00:05] revelation and Lord if there would be
[1:00:07] some Among Us who are sick this morning
[1:00:10] or maybe they are weary or down in their
[1:00:14] Spirit may you come Lord and lift them
[1:00:17] higher in your word we
[1:00:19] pray heal our sick Lord forgive us of
[1:00:23] our sins do something something
[1:00:26] wonderful among us because you are an
[1:00:28] awesome
[1:00:30] God and Lord we ask your blessings upon
[1:00:33] this Tabernacle and upon the officers
[1:00:36] and the Ministers of this church may you
[1:00:39] use them dear God in a great way Lord
[1:00:42] that Tucson once more will know that
[1:00:45] you're the same yesterday today and
[1:00:49] forever Lord those who have traveled to
[1:00:51] be here today may you bless their
[1:00:53] efforts Lord when everything said and
[1:00:56] may it be for your glory and may we say
[1:00:59] did not our hearts burn within us as he
[1:01:02] walked and talked with us along the way
[1:01:05] we commit this service into your hands
[1:01:06] now For Your
[1:01:08] Glory for we ask these things in Jesus
[1:01:11] name and the bride says God bless you
[1:01:14] Saints you may be seated I want to speak
[1:01:17] to you for a few minutes on hold
[1:01:19] on now hold on by definition it means to
[1:01:24] endure or keep going in difficult
[1:01:28] circumstances to hold on it means to
[1:01:31] keep on to last to continue to persevere
[1:01:36] to struggle on to carry on to go on to
[1:01:40] hang on to hold out to not give up to
[1:01:45] see it through to stay the course to
[1:01:47] sold your own for you veterans this
[1:01:50] morning to stick at it to stick it out
[1:01:53] to hang in there all these are simul
[1:01:56] definitions of the meaning of hold
[1:01:59] on but the opposite of hold on this
[1:02:02] morning is to give up and I'm going to
[1:02:05] tell you that every person in this
[1:02:07] building will do one or the other you'll
[1:02:10] either hold on endure persevere keep
[1:02:14] going struggling on moving on pressing
[1:02:17] on or you'll give
[1:02:20] up we're living in a Time friends that
[1:02:23] we've never seen such a time I'm 61 year
[1:02:26] old and I've never seen such a time that
[1:02:28] our nation or is in at this
[1:02:31] time fear among the
[1:02:34] people put up their hands and
[1:02:37] quitting suicides at an alltime high
[1:02:41] depression at an alltime high Insanity
[1:02:44] at an alltime high divorce at an alltime
[1:02:48] high alcoholism is an alltime high drug
[1:02:52] addiction is an all-time high we're
[1:02:54] living in a Time when they want to shut
[1:02:56] our churches down but keep the liquor
[1:02:59] Ste liquor stores
[1:03:01] open and people are giving up people are
[1:03:05] walking
[1:03:07] away people are laying down and quitting
[1:03:10] but I say to you this morning Tu s
[1:03:13] Tabernacle don't give up just hold on
[1:03:17] Amen you know this shud my woman that we
[1:03:20] read about in the Bible this morning she
[1:03:22] to me is the very definition of hold on
[1:03:26] she stayed the course she did not give
[1:03:30] up until she got her son back now to get
[1:03:34] an understanding of what's going on in
[1:03:36] this scripture we must go back to where
[1:03:39] the story
[1:03:41] starts this woman that we read about in
[1:03:44] the Bible it doesn't give her
[1:03:47] name but it does give her
[1:03:51] character that even thousands of years
[1:03:54] later after this event we still talk
[1:03:57] about the faith of the shemite woman and
[1:04:00] I say this morning if the world Never
[1:04:03] Knows My Name God give me Grace that
[1:04:07] they know my
[1:04:08] faith Hallelujah that I stood the course
[1:04:12] that I stayed the course that I did not
[1:04:15] give
[1:04:16] up amen it doesn't give her name but it
[1:04:20] does tell us where she's from she is a
[1:04:23] sudoite woman from the city of
[1:04:26] Shain now schain means a double
[1:04:30] rest she was from the city of a double
[1:04:33] rest or two places of rest now Shain is
[1:04:39] a city in ascar north of manassis about
[1:04:42] five miles south of Mount Taber is where
[1:04:45] it's located and the great prophet
[1:04:48] Elisha would travel through this city on
[1:04:50] his travels and so it came to pass that
[1:04:54] she noticed this man of
[1:04:56] God and she wanted to do something for
[1:04:59] him she offered him some bread and
[1:05:02] defended the man of God and one day she
[1:05:05] told her husband I want to make room in
[1:05:08] our house for the man of God that he
[1:05:11] could have a place when he passes
[1:05:13] through that he can have a place of rest
[1:05:17] in a city called
[1:05:20] rest so she made a room in her home for
[1:05:24] the prophet
[1:05:26] and no doubt she called it the Elisha
[1:05:29] room I've stayed in many of
[1:05:33] them and I think that would be a good
[1:05:35] thing for us to do here this
[1:05:38] morning is that we would clean some of
[1:05:41] the junk out of our
[1:05:44] lives that we would get rid of some of
[1:05:47] the Clutter that's in our lives the
[1:05:49] things we brought into our lives that
[1:05:51] keeps us upset that keeps us distracted
[1:05:56] and make room for
[1:05:59] Jesus Oh My wouldn't it be something if
[1:06:02] we spent as much time with our face in
[1:06:05] this
[1:06:06] book as we did on
[1:06:08] Facebook we don't get too many amens but
[1:06:11] that's all
[1:06:12] right Amen to get the things out of our
[1:06:16] life to get the junk and the Clutter
[1:06:18] that's out of our Lives to make more
[1:06:21] room for Jesus like Elijah told him did
[1:06:25] this Valley full of ditches and the
[1:06:28] deeper you dig the more water you'll
[1:06:31] have and I say to you this morning dig
[1:06:33] out the fear dig out the unbelief dig
[1:06:36] the Clutter of the world out of our
[1:06:38] lives and make more room for the Holy
[1:06:42] Spirit and when she did this act of
[1:06:44] kindness for this man of God the Bible
[1:06:48] says amen that he who receives a prophet
[1:06:53] in the name of a prophet receives a
[1:06:55] prophet's
[1:06:56] reward and the prophet told us that God
[1:07:00] cares for those who
[1:07:03] cares God cares for those who care for
[1:07:07] him the Bible also says as you've done
[1:07:10] it unto the least of these my little
[1:07:13] ones you have done it unto me so it
[1:07:16] pleased the prophet and he wanted to do
[1:07:19] something for her and Gaza said Master
[1:07:22] she doesn't have a child
[1:07:25] the prophet said bring her here and he
[1:07:27] said next year according to the time of
[1:07:30] life you will have a
[1:07:33] child and the next year according to the
[1:07:36] prophet's word she had a
[1:07:39] child and when this boy was 11 year old

[1:21:52] years in a wheelchair
[1:21:54] how many people gave up that that man
[1:21:56] would ever walk again how many people in
[1:21:58] his family gave up to the fact he'd ever
[1:22:00] stand on his feet again but God moved
[1:22:04] upon Congress and Upshaw 66 years later
[1:22:07] and a man who had been paralyzed from a
[1:22:09] young boy stood on his feet and walked
[1:22:11] out of the meeting just be found
[1:22:13] believing God when the angel comes by to
[1:22:17] visit oh my that's right just hold on to

[1:22:34] hold on to it I'll not leave you stay
[1:22:38] like Jacob did he wrestled with an angel
[1:22:41] of God all night
[1:22:45] long I'm going to hold on to you till
[1:22:48] you bless me and give me the things that
[1:22:50] I desired I want you to notice it
[1:22:52] wasn't it wasn't Jacob that was saying
[1:22:55] let me go it was the
[1:22:59] angel it was the angel said let me go
[1:23:02] it's getting daylight I've got to go and
[1:23:05] he said no
[1:23:07] sir I'm not let you go till you bless me
[1:23:10] I'll not let you go till you give me
[1:23:13] that which I have need
[1:23:15] of oh Hallelujah God give me Grace to

[1:23:22] that angel said let me go he said I'll
[1:23:25] not let you go I like that the prophet
[1:23:27] said hold on to him that's right stay on
[1:23:29] out with him you see her faith wasn't in
[1:23:32] the staff it was in the
[1:23:35] prophet she said as the Lord God your
[1:23:38] lord God liveth and never dies and your
[1:23:40] soul never dies I'm not going to leave
[1:23:42] you I'm going to stay right here if you
[1:23:45] take Jesus for your healer don't you
[1:23:47] never let no devil or nothing else ever
[1:23:51] back you out of
[1:23:53] it ain't it something people will hold
[1:23:55] on to God until the doctor says that
[1:23:58] there's no hope and then they give up
[1:24:00] that's the time to hold on even more
[1:24:04] so the woman with the blood issue 12
[1:24:07] years she went to the doctor 12 years
[1:24:10] she bled but when she spent all of her
[1:24:12] money and the insurance ran out then the
[1:24:15] doctor said he couldn't help her that
[1:24:18] wouldn't have been nice if he told her
[1:24:19] the first
[1:24:22] day you know the amazes me how people
[1:24:25] put so much faith in doctors I've got
[1:24:27] nothing against doctors friends I used
[1:24:29] to work with them but I'll tell you one
[1:24:30] thing about doctors they bury their
[1:24:35] mistakes and I've seen a few of them
[1:24:38] nobody means to do it but it happens
[1:24:40] I've been in surgery when it goes wrong
[1:24:41] and the patient dies on the table nobody
[1:24:43] wants that but it happens but people put
[1:24:46] so much Faith well the doctor said it's
[1:24:49] the worst case he ever
[1:24:51] saw but what you don't know is he told
[1:24:53] the person before you same
[1:24:55] thing and people put so much faith in
[1:24:57] their doctor but remember out of the
[1:24:59] class of 100 somebody finished
[1:25:02] last and it might be your
[1:25:06] doctor amen do you believe in doctors
[1:25:08] absolutely do you go to doctors yes I do
[1:25:10] do you yes I do but when the doctor says
[1:25:13] he can't help me no more brother I know
[1:25:15] somebody who can I've got another doctor
[1:25:17] on the case his name is Doctor Jesus and
[1:25:19] he's never lost the case and when the
[1:25:21] doctor says I can't help you you know
[1:25:22] what that means to me it's just another
[1:25:25] chance for my God to do a miracle and
[1:25:28] show me just how big he
[1:25:30] is
[1:25:32] amen oh
[1:25:36] Hallelujah I like that front of her
[1:25:38] there's plenty of room to preach
[1:25:42] amen amen don't let nothing talk you out
[1:25:45] of it stay right with it stay right as
[1:25:47] the Lord your God lives and as your soul
[1:25:49] never dies I'll not leave you till I
[1:25:51] find out about my baby and when Elisha
[1:25:53] couldn't get rid of her he went with her
[1:25:57] and that's the way you want to be with
[1:25:59] Jesus you want to get on his hands just
[1:26:01] stay there cry out day and night and
[1:26:04] that's the way yes sir don't you turn
[1:26:06] loose don't you back up one bit if you
[1:26:09] believe
[1:26:10] it and stay there there's Mercy in the
[1:26:15] Lord stay with it you need the Holy
[1:26:17] Ghost cry out for it you need healing
[1:26:20] cry out for it ask the one who's able
[1:26:26] amen don't you remember Jesus teaching
[1:26:28] about the unjust judge and how this
[1:26:30] woman
[1:26:32] constantly knocked at his door day and
[1:26:34] night she wouldn't leave him alone he
[1:26:36] sent her away one day she was back the
[1:26:38] next day constantly knocking on the door
[1:26:41] she was persistent he turned her away
[1:26:43] one day she'd come back the next day you
[1:26:45] know what he said I neither fear God nor
[1:26:47] man but This Woman's driving me crazy
[1:26:55] everywhere I look she's
[1:26:58] there I go in the kitchen she's looking
[1:27:00] through the
[1:27:01] window I cannot get rid of this
[1:27:05] woman I either fear God or man this
[1:27:09] woman torments
[1:27:10] me and that's the way you want to get
[1:27:12] with God be on his hands every morning
[1:27:14] be on his hands every night Lord I'm
[1:27:16] just a knocking I'm just knocking what

[1:32:40] hold of it don't let go stay right with
[1:32:45] it if it don't come now it'll come 10
[1:32:47] minutes from now it'll come an hour from
[1:32:48] now two weeks from now a month from now
[1:32:51] it does not matter our God even when we
[1:32:54] think he's four days late he's still
[1:32:57] right on
[1:33:01] time
[1:33:03] amen amen I'm going to take a hold of
[1:33:06] God's promise and I'm going to hold on
[1:33:08] to it listen to this quote can I have a
[1:33:11] little bit I don't know have much time
[1:33:12] but listen to this quote right here the
[1:33:16] Bible says they shall lay hands on the
[1:33:19] sick and they shall recover now that's
[1:33:23] the word of God
[1:33:24] the word of God does not fail now listen
[1:33:26] to this quote but the outside
[1:33:30] world wants you to believe as soon as
[1:33:35] you lay hands on the sick that crippled
[1:33:37] leg must be straight you must jump up
[1:33:40] and
[1:33:40] down so the outside world wants us to
[1:33:43] believe that when a person with a
[1:33:45] crippled leg or a crippled arm comes up
[1:33:47] to the Altar and a man prays for him or
[1:33:49] the church prays for him that instantly
[1:33:51] that's supposed to straighten out and
[1:33:53] they're supposed to jump up and run out
[1:33:54] of the church screaming and shouting
[1:33:56] well that's wonderful that would
[1:33:57] certainly be a miracle but you see God
[1:33:59] never said
[1:34:01] that the prophet said he never promised
[1:34:04] that he said the prayer of faith shall
[1:34:06] save the sick and God will raise them up
[1:34:09] but he never said
[1:34:12] when they shall lay their hands on the
[1:34:15] sick and they shall recover but he never
[1:34:19] said whenn
[1:34:24] just hold on to the promise just be
[1:34:26] found believing the
[1:34:29] promise he said when you pray believe
[1:34:31] you receive it and it shall be given to
[1:34:36] you but he never
[1:34:39] said
[1:34:41] with that's the Bible
[1:34:44] friends that's the Bible but we want the
[1:34:47] outside world to add their ideals to the
[1:34:50] word of God and when you mix it you've
[1:34:52] got a hybrid faith you see when you mix
[1:34:54] Faith with doubt when you mix Faith with
[1:34:57] fear you've got a hybrid
[1:34:59] faith and it will not produce the
[1:35:02] results but if you just simply take God
[1:35:05] at his
[1:35:06] word and believe it and testify of it
[1:35:09] you will get well
[1:35:12] am when I don't know but Abraham waited
[1:35:15] 25 years Y at least wait 25
[1:35:18] days we can't wait 25 minutes because of
[1:35:21] Instagram
[1:35:23] Amen brother down preach think I believe
[1:35:25] it will we're the most impatient
[1:35:27] generation they are on the earth if we
[1:35:29] can't get the oatmeal packed open we
[1:35:31] want to throw it
[1:35:34] down well Glory I'm going home I'm going
[1:35:38] soon amen like Elijah and Elisha Elijah
[1:35:43] laid that manle on Elisha while he was
[1:35:46] plowing in the field and the Manel did
[1:35:49] not fit Elisha but Elisha wanted the
[1:35:52] Manel so he gave up the plow and he took
[1:35:55] off after
[1:35:57] Elijah he was not leaving Elijah until
[1:36:01] he got the metal and Elisha held on how
[1:36:06] many knows how long anybody
[1:36:10] know oh my
[1:36:12] goodness does anybody
[1:36:15] know 10
[1:36:17] years Elisha held on for 10 years walked
[1:36:24] with Elijah but you see God never cut
[1:36:28] the robe to fit Elisha but the 10 years
[1:36:31] of walking with the prophet's message
[1:36:34] what did it do it shaped Elisha to fit
[1:36:37] the manle and let me tell you something
[1:36:39] brother and sister God will never cut
[1:36:41] this message to fit your ideals but he
[1:36:43] will cut you and mold you and shape you
[1:36:46] to you fit the
[1:36:50] message amen amen he wanted that metal
[1:36:54] he never altered that robe friends amen
[1:36:58] but he altered Elisha to fif the robe
[1:37:01] God made the robe
[1:37:03] perfect he's got to bring us into that
[1:37:05] real to make us fit the robe the Bible
[1:37:10] says being confident of this very thing
[1:37:12] that he which have begun a good work in
[1:37:14] you will perform it until the day of
[1:37:17] Jesus
[1:37:18] Christ what are you saying I'm saying
[1:37:21] this he never brought us this far to
[1:37:23] leaveing us he never taught us to swim
[1:37:25] to let us drown he never lifted me up to
[1:37:27] let me
[1:37:29] down and he never built a home in me to
[1:37:31] move
[1:37:33] away but the Potter when he picks up the
[1:37:35] clay if you'll ever study about the
[1:37:37] Potter when he picked up the clay do you
[1:37:39] know he never laid it down it never left
[1:37:43] his
[1:37:46] hand God has picked us up into his hand
[1:37:48] he will not lay us down till we fit the
[1:37:51] image that he had of us in his
[1:37:54] before there was a star in the
[1:37:56] heavens Oh Glory to
[1:37:59] God Amen what did Elijah tell
[1:38:03] Elisha he said the Lord has sent me to
[1:38:05] bethl I want you to stay here you know
[1:38:07] what Elisha said as the Lord liveth and
[1:38:10] as my soul liveth I'll not leave Thee I
[1:38:13] ain't standing no bethl I'm going with
[1:38:14] you and they went to Jordan and you know
[1:38:16] the story they went to two three
[1:38:17] different places and Elijah kept saying
[1:38:19] you need to stay here you need to let go
[1:38:23] I I've got to go
[1:38:25] on Ela said I'm not leaving you I am not
[1:38:30] leaving you I'm holding on and they come
[1:38:33] down to the river and Elijah took the
[1:38:36] mantle and he took it and he struck the
[1:38:38] water and the water parted and they went
[1:38:41] over both of
[1:38:43] them and the water closed behind them
[1:38:47] and now they was in a secret
[1:38:51] place and Elisha
[1:38:55] Elijah said you've asked what do you
[1:38:57] want of
[1:38:58] me he
[1:39:01] said I want a double portion of your
[1:39:03] spirit what God gave you was good but
[1:39:06] like the man eating watermelon there's
[1:39:08] got to be some more of that
[1:39:11] somewhere I want what you've got but I
[1:39:14] want a double portion and Elijah said
[1:39:16] thou has asked a hard thing but
[1:39:18] nonetheless if you see me when I go you
[1:39:20] can have what you asked for what did it
[1:39:23] caus him to do it cost him to hold on it
[1:39:25] costus a singleness of eye a singl of
[1:39:27] heart a singleness of Faith a singl of
[1:39:30] mind he had to keep his eye on the
[1:39:32] promise and I say to you my brother my
[1:39:34] sister keep your eye on the word stay
[1:39:36] with the message of the
[1:39:39] hour don't get on the internet look at
[1:39:42] all these nonsense and bunch of people
[1:39:43] walking away from this message stay with
[1:39:45] the word
[1:39:49] amen you know the story when Elijah went
[1:39:51] up Elisha said you promise
[1:39:58] me 10 years 10 years of
[1:40:03] walking with the prophet he goes over
[1:40:07] and he picks up The
[1:40:09] Mantel and he puts it on
[1:40:25] it
[1:40:28] fit it fit he goes down to the same
[1:40:32] river with the same mounting with the
[1:40:35] same manle with the same God and he
[1:40:37] struck the water and you know what he
[1:40:38] said where is the god of
[1:40:42] Elijah he wasn't asking a question he
[1:40:44] was making a statement that the God that
[1:40:46] was with Elijah th now rest on Elisha
[1:40:49] don't you see my brother my sister what
[1:40:51] our lord Jesus has done he said his
[1:40:53] Spirit up on high but on the day of
[1:40:55] Pentecost down came the manle amen
[1:40:58] hallelujah and what is he gave the
[1:40:59] church a double portion of the spirit
[1:41:02] say John 14:12 the works I do shall you
[1:41:04] do also and Greater Works than the shall
[1:41:06] you do you can't do nothing greater than
[1:41:08] raise the dead but what does that mean
[1:41:10] it means more why because when Jesus was
[1:41:13] here it was one man in one body doing
[1:41:16] the works now it's that same Jesus in a
[1:41:19] many membered body around the world
[1:41:24] making himself the same yesterday and
[1:41:27] forever and the church picks up the
[1:41:28] manle and we cry out where is the god
[1:41:32] that was on Jesus Christ where is the
[1:41:34] power of his resurrection I'll tell you
[1:41:37] where it's on his
[1:41:43] people oh Hallelujah glory to God do you
[1:41:47] love
[1:41:49] him I want a double portion you see God
[1:41:52] likes to give you just just as much as
[1:41:54] you've got faith to
[1:41:56] receive you see when you ask God for big
[1:41:58] things you know what you're telling God
[1:42:00] I believe you're a big
[1:42:04] God Amen God won't run out he's got
[1:42:08] plenty of blessings just hold on to the
[1:42:11] just hold on to the promised RS he h on
[1:42:15] till the manle was his oh soldiers of
[1:42:18] the Cross just keep soldiering on just
[1:42:22] keep pressing on don't give up Don't
[1:42:24] Turn back don't let go I'm discouraged
[1:42:27] brother Dar but hold on to Jesus the
[1:42:30] doctor says it's bad brother Daryl but
[1:42:31] hold on to Jesus don't look at the
[1:42:33] situation look at the
[1:42:36] solution Look to Him grab a hold of the
[1:42:39] promise like that black girl in Memphis
[1:42:42] let's look at this just before we
[1:42:44] close her Daddy had heard on the radio
[1:42:47] that a man up in Ken Missouri had his
[1:42:49] eyesight restored to him that morning
[1:42:53] her
[1:42:55] father got the money together and they
[1:42:58] called a bus from Memphis Tennessee to
[1:43:00] Jonesburg Arkansas I was just there last
[1:43:02] weekend I was thinking about this as I
[1:43:04] was passing through
[1:43:07] Jonesburg to get up to where the meeting
[1:43:10] is there's so many people there they
[1:43:13] can't even get to the
[1:43:15] church and her daddy tells this blind
[1:43:18] girl you stay right here I'm going to go
[1:43:20] find the Healer and I'll bring him back
[1:43:22] to you
[1:43:24] but the crowd moving around bumped the
[1:43:25] girl and she lost her place and she was
[1:43:28] blind and now she was in the crowd just
[1:43:30] moving through the crowd blind and she
[1:43:33] was crying would someone help me please
[1:43:35] would someone please help me but
[1:43:39] everybody was more concerned about their
[1:43:41] self than there was this poor black
[1:43:43] blind
[1:43:44] girl so they paid her no attention now
[1:43:47] the prophet of God was inside he said he
[1:43:49] drank orange juice stayed at the pull
[1:43:51] pit day and night
[1:43:54] because he promised he would pray for
[1:43:56] every
[1:43:57] person but he said at the end of eight
[1:43:59] days there was more to pray for than
[1:44:01] they were at the first day because word
[1:44:03] got out that people were being healed
[1:44:04] and they come from
[1:44:06] everywhere and they come and got the
[1:44:08] prophet of God and took him out to an
[1:44:09] ambulance where a woman was laying
[1:44:12] dead and the prophet prayed for the
[1:44:14] woman and she raised
[1:44:17] up and they took the prophet out of the
[1:44:19] amance and said brother Brandon we'll
[1:44:21] never get you in the way you come
[1:44:23] perhaps you can get around this way and
[1:44:25] he was passing through the crowd trying
[1:44:27] to get back in the
[1:44:29] building and all those people he were
[1:44:32] passing through was there to see
[1:44:36] him but the sad thing of it was they
[1:44:40] didn't know who he
[1:44:41] was and he was saying excuse me I didn't
[1:44:44] mean to step on your toes I'm I'm trying
[1:44:45] to get back around the back here and
[1:44:47] maybe some of them had an attitude would
[1:44:49] you get out of the way I'm trying to get
[1:44:50] in there and see this man
[1:44:54] and the one they wanted to see was
[1:44:55] passing right in front of them I wonder
[1:44:58] how many times Jesus has passed right by
[1:45:01] you I wonder how many times Jesus has
[1:45:04] sat in the Pew beside
[1:45:06] you and you fail to recognize him
[1:45:09] because you didn't see the way he would
[1:45:11] come in this
[1:45:12] day you see you got to know where he's
[1:45:15] at he said a little while the world will
[1:45:17] see me no more but ye shall see me for
[1:45:19] I'll be with you even then where's he at
[1:45:24] he's right here with us now friends you
[1:45:27] know everybody's wearing masks now right
[1:45:30] I went into a store the other day to get
[1:45:31] something to drink this man must have
[1:45:33] come there quite a bit and he walked in
[1:45:34] the store and she said
[1:45:37] hey you've changed your
[1:45:40] mask and when she said that I about had
[1:45:43] a spell because you see that's exactly
