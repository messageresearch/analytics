[37:03] 47 minutes or so left on that
[37:07] but that's less than an hour and I've I

[37:26] worry
[37:27] but
[37:28] this is Colossians 1 and 9.
[37:32] and this is a prayer this talks about
[37:34] how Paul
[37:36] prayed for these people that he loved
[37:38] and here we love one another and we say
[37:41] we're praying for each other but we pray
[37:43] for each other like this do we pray with
[37:45] with faith for things like this and
[37:47] expectations for things like this so

[38:21] Jeremy let him be filled with the
[38:23] knowledge of your will and
[38:25] all wisdom and spiritual understanding

[40:50] don't want you to miss it I I got to I
[40:52] got to take this tape now I'm going to
[40:54] start this far one more great remark I
[40:56] want to make if I have to move over a
[40:58] little of it now notice
[41:00] listen to this
[41:02] now is the greatness now is where we
[41:05] want to watch remember in the last days
[41:09] will exactly go back and vindicate the
[41:14] first date
[41:16] leave Adam and Eve husband and wife no
[41:19] sin life than the fall
[41:21] notice notice closely
[41:26] notice
[41:27] what caused it
[41:30] Lucifer
[41:33] Lucifer
[41:34] is doing now as he did at the first time
[41:40] just as the kingdom of the Gentiles was
[41:42] brought in the King Nebuchadnezzar
[41:44] Vindicated a gentile Race by a prophet
[41:48] who can interpret unknown time vision
[41:52] dreams
[41:54] and has come down to the Gentiles
[41:56] without anything just needs a purchase
[41:57] an iron and so forth and in defeat it
[41:59] goes out the same way
[42:02] again the Gentile Kingdom notice Lucifer
[42:06] in the last days is doing as he did it
[42:09] first what did Lucifer do the first
[42:11] thing that Lucifer done to separate the
[42:13] fellowship of God in man he wanted to
[42:15] build him a United Kingdom
[42:19] a greater splendor
[42:21] and seemingly more cultured
[42:26] a greater Kingdom than Michael Christ
[42:28] had
[42:30] you got him
[42:32] now if you miss it just hold up your
[42:34] hand I'll say it again see the Lucifer
[42:36] at the beginning his purpose and heart
[42:39] was to achieve a brighter and greater
[42:42] thing in heaven
[42:43] than Christ had is that right
[42:49] more beautiful more Splinter than a
[42:52] kingdom of Christ
[42:54] do you think we'll have automobiles in
[42:56] the Millennium for the airplane
[42:59] see what Lucifer's doing now the big
[43:02] fancy it the intellectual
[43:04] s and are doing the very same thing
[43:07] Gathering themselves together to do the
[43:08] same thing
[43:09] see
[43:11] they are gathering and denominating
[43:14] themselves each one trying to beat the
[43:16] other and now they got some rough
[43:18] Splinter they don't know what to do but
[43:19] to United with the Catholic Church
[43:22] Lucifer again
[43:25] building a bigger Kingdom to push out
[43:27] people that don't believe in
[43:29] denominations and even take their Church
[43:30] feelings and make storerooms and the
[43:32] pastors of such has no rights at all
[43:36] and a man that is a godsend man would
[43:38] never stand in the denomination that
[43:39] you're hearing this or seeing it because
[43:40] he's got enough to go out and look at it
[43:43] I think I don't say that critically I
[43:45] said truthfully to see that reveal
[43:48] notice
[43:52] Lucifer is doing the same thing can you
[43:54] see it
[43:55] the devil doing the same thing building
[43:58] up a hybrid Church
[44:01] a hybrid a hybrid member however by
[44:05] knowledge instead of the word an
[44:07] intellectual man instead of born again
[44:09] man
[44:10] building an intellectual Kingdom that'll
[44:13] outside Christ little bitty pop
[44:16] see
[44:17] what is it that did that fallen angels
[44:23] angels who listen to Lucifer
[44:26] instead of Christ who they once belong
[44:28] to is that right
[44:30] now listen close
[44:31] Fallen Angels what kind of angel
[44:35] Luther
[44:36] Wesley Catholic Pentecostal who can't
[44:40] knock their first estate
[44:43] like the Angels did and it's fell into
[44:46] organizations like Lucifer's Main and
[44:49] nicaea
[44:51] and what have they done organize the
[44:53] great economical Association of
[44:55] ministers to make an image into the
[44:57] beasts of the Bible said and building a
[45:00] Christian economy that will close the
[45:03] doors of this church
[45:08] see Lucifer at his work I'm trying to
[45:11] bring you the three-fold Revelation or
[45:13] mystery of God
[45:15] what did they do sold out to reasonings
[45:19] of wisdom and education like Eve did
[45:22] Fallen Angels in
[45:24] Wesley was a man of God
[45:27] but what party
[45:29] Four Angels got into it
[45:31] what was the Angels first create beings
[45:34] of God that fell for losers wisdom
[45:38] Lucifer's wisdom
[45:40] and she wants to become fallen angels
[45:43] and organizations from man of God who's
[45:46] went forth to establish truths in the
[45:48] Earth
[45:49] before that truth could go wrong and
[45:51] proximate and get onto the real
[45:52] revelation of Christ Fallen Angels come
[45:54] in and took it over and made
[45:56] denominations out of it that's the
[45:58] reason the Revelation all the seven seal
[46:01] mystery had to be unfolded
[46:03] [Applause]
[46:05] amen
[46:07] how you see it
[46:10] what they left off if Luther would have
[46:13] went on it had been here
[46:15] if Wesley would have went on if
[46:17] Pentecost went around what would they
[46:19] done now there's only one thing can
[46:21] happen there has to be a message at the
[46:24] end time when there is nothing else can
[46:27] fall and now the economical world is set
[46:29] up such a regime that their Cathedral
[46:32] denomination no rub nothing else follow
[46:34] it
[46:35] you're either in it or you're not in it
[46:38] amen the fruit is in the top of the tree
[46:41] and the light is shining on that
[46:43] predestinated fruit is just writing into
[46:45] Christ's light fruit
[46:47] bringing forth the same melanous as
[46:50] sweetness In The Same Spirit that he had
[46:52] in him
[46:53] hope you see it
[46:55] see I try to put too much in one day but
[46:57] where are you out so they sold out to
[47:00] reasons sold out to reasonings of
[47:03] denomination if I just belong to this
[47:04] the the mayor goes to this church
[47:06] right if I can be a Methodist or a
[47:09] presbyterian just look where they've
[47:10] gone now I've just explained them limbs
[47:12] are pruned walked or dead they're not
[47:14] connected with Christ anymore they bring
[47:15] you the same mind
[47:17] they're not connected with it but
[47:19] they're they're like a citrus fruit any
[47:21] citrus fruit will live on a citrus tree
[47:22] but it'll bring its own fruit you put a
[47:25] grapefruit in a orange tree it'll live
[47:27] by the orange tree but it rained for
[47:29] grapefruit you put a lemon in there it's
[47:31] the citrus fruit he'll bring forth an
[47:32] old style lemon but it's living off of
[47:34] life that's what the nominations are
[47:36] doing by under the name of the church
[47:39] it's a bride
[47:41] that's the original tree the original
[47:43] Spirit the Revelation comes from Christ
[47:45] not the denomination Christ
[47:48] daughters
[47:50] what did our nation try to exalt itself
[47:53] like Lucifer
[47:55] they so call themselves The Church the
[47:58] bride which they are in Revelation 17 is
[48:01] this folk of the false bride above
[48:03] Christ's Little Flock the bride Lucifer
[48:06] thanks and exalts himself above the
[48:09] humble word of God's truth by the
[48:12] knowledge of the revelation
[48:13] and has placed himself by a seminary
[48:16] education and theology
[48:19] until they have got themselves up and if
[48:21] you don't belong in their group then you
[48:24] are a outwasher
[48:27] like Lucifer did in the beginning
[48:31] say to the people just exactly what
[48:33] Lucifer said to Eve surely God will
[48:36] receive us
[48:38] we feed the poor that's good
[48:40] surely you will receive us we are a
[48:43] great denomination we are a beautiful
[48:46] Church well look at our great buildings
[48:48] look at our great membership we stand in
[48:50] the minions surely God will not turn
[48:52] that group down the same thing that Cain
[48:55] did brought in the pretty fruits from
[48:58] the ground that he had killed and toiled
[49:00] and worked and brought in the fruits and
[49:02] rejected the humble blood of the Lamb
[49:07] right
[49:08] God have mercy that man and women will
[49:11] not think I'm saying this to exalt
[49:13] something or some personal revelation or
[49:15] something I'm only telling you the truth
[49:17] amen can't you see what they're doing
[49:21] I speak it loud and harsh but you've got
[49:23] to drive an ill to the clinches if it's
[49:25] going to do any good
[49:26] right so you'll see it
[49:28] now
[49:30] saying to the people
[49:32] surely you mean to tell me that our
[49:34] Greek Catholic church has stood all this
[49:35] time our great Methodist North look at
[49:37] our forefathers
[49:39] but they broke the word of the Lord
[49:41] and Eve was God's one of his she was a
[49:45] byproduct of Adam
[49:47] and because she doubted one word of
[49:50] God's word it did it
[49:53] and here's Lucifer at his job again
[49:55] today I remember the Antichrist is not
[49:58] communism
[49:59] the Antichrist is so close like the real
[50:01] thing to see the very elected if it was
[50:04] possible Jesus said Matthew 24 the
[50:06] elected if it was possible
[50:09] Lucifer again Lucifer again is breaking
[50:13] God's unity in Man by his his is limited
[50:18] the word of God to his reasonings what
[50:22] he thinks is right what he thinks he
[50:23] breaks the word of God and same thing he
[50:25] did in the days of Jesus and Jesus said
[50:27] you by your Traditions has made the word
[50:29] of God of no effect
[50:31] and the denominations by their organized
[50:34] uh intellectual reasons has made God's
[50:37] word of no effect upon the people right
[50:40] they just can't see it then they say
[50:41] where is the god of the Bible
[50:44] he's right here he's the Bible that's
[50:46] what he is notice now Lucifer comes into
[50:50] communists and Bridge the unity of God
[50:54] to man just like you did in Eden
[50:58] by great Temptations of promises of
[51:02] self-power and exaltations
[51:06] well you might become a bishop of you to
[51:07] stay with us
[51:08] you might come to District presbyter why
[51:11] would you go to something like that see
[51:12] that's Pentecostal
[51:15] the Catholic and so forth see a great
[51:17] false promise to man to receive power
[51:20] outside the word and promise of God you
[51:24] receive power when the Holy Ghost has
[51:25] come upon you not when you become a
[51:27] bishop or a deacon or whatever you are
[51:28] amen
[51:29] but Lucifer's at his job again does this
[51:32] church understand that raise your hand
[51:33] so I'll see you all right I won't stay
[51:35] with it any longer then
[51:37] breaking from apart from the word of God
[51:41] see
[51:42] he did the same at Nastia Rome
[51:46] you know what Constantine give him
[51:49] you went through the church ages he get
[51:51] they didn't have nothing but just Christ
[51:54] and they're set in the low buildings
[51:55] anywhere they could on hard
[51:57] Rock floor
[51:59] you know that if you talk to nicia
[52:01] Council in the Preen I see a counseling
[52:03] and I see a fathers and so forth in the
[52:05] history of the church they have nothing
[52:07] but when they have this Council and
[52:09] inducted some of the Roman paganism into
[52:12] Christianity and for holy man and
[52:15] Bishops and so forth and popes and all
[52:17] this kind of nonsense what did
[52:19] Constantine give him I asked anything
[52:21] Logan to tell me he gave him property
[52:24] he'd give them freedom
[52:26] and all that they wanted
[52:28] and they swapped the word of God for the
[52:32] wisdom and culture of man
[52:34] and that's the same thing Lucifer did
[52:36] then he did in the Garden of Eden and
[52:38] they died right there the Pentecostal
[52:41] Church died at Nasir Rome but to be
[52:44] resurrected in the bride during the last
[52:45] days
[52:46] notice Lucifer comes in Conan like he
[52:49] did a dance and by Temptations and false
[52:52] promises of power out apart from the
[52:55] word of God he did the same and I see a
[52:57] Rome he's doing the same today at the
[52:59] World Council of ecumenical churches
[53:01] let's all unite together the Pope says I
[53:04] want all my economical Brethren out
[53:07] there to unite with me we're alone
[53:09] that's right into organizations you are
[53:10] one but that has nothing to do with the
[53:13] bride of Christ amen not a thing brother
[53:15] you'll never wash her anything like that
[53:19] now it is Promised in the last days that
[53:24] the original faith in the same to be
[53:27] restored to the children of God
[53:30] at the time of the Bride tree Malachi 4.
[53:34] God said before the world burns up as
[53:37] far behold I send to you Elijah the
[53:39] prophet he will restore the faith of the
[53:41] children now that wasn't the first
[53:43] Elijah to come
[53:44] no no now we don't teach your Elijah's
[53:47] Mantle and Elijah's blankets and all
[53:49] those things like that we just teach the
[53:50] word of God that's what he said see we
[53:52] got all kind of a Elijah this and Elijah
[53:55] that which is nonsense amen that's we
[53:57] know that that's I'm not talking about
[53:59] that and you it's spiritual minded to
[54:00] understand see as the late hours getting
[54:02] late and can't put it all on this tape
[54:03] of course now the promise in the last
[54:06] days now if the Jesus said and and
[54:10] Matthew I believe the 11th chapter of
[54:12] the sixth chapter and no it's 11th
[54:14] chapter and about the sixth verse when
[54:16] John sent his disciples over there to
[54:18] see if he really was the one Jesus said
[54:20] who did you go out to see a a win the
[54:24] Reed is shaken by the winds did you go
[54:26] out to see such and such he said or did
[54:28] you go to see a prophet he said more
[54:31] than a prophet John was more than a
[54:33] prophet he was the messenger of the
[54:36] Covenant
[54:37] yes and he said if you can receive it
[54:40] this is he
[54:42] which is spoke of the prophets I'll send
[54:44] my message here before my face
[54:46] now that's Malachi 3 not Malachi 4
[54:50] because the Elisha that was the common
[54:52] Malachi for their Earth was to be burnt
[54:55] with a fervent Heat and the righteous
[54:57] was to walk out in the Millennium upon
[54:59] the ashes of the wicked
[55:02] so it is not that one see now we see the
[55:07] Promise being fulfilled Christ the true
[55:09] headship
[55:11] going in coming in his bride doing the
[55:15] same works that he did at the beginning
[55:17] and making ready and fulfilling his word
[55:20] as he did at first in John 14 12 he that
[55:24] believeth on me the works that I do
[55:26] shall he do also then the head and the
[55:29] body are becoming one in works and in
[55:32] sign and in life
[55:34] Vindicated by God himself to his
[55:37] promised word for the last days he
[55:39] promised this in the right State now if
[55:42] you're spiritual you're catch it
[55:44] then we can see that the married supper
[55:49] is at hand
[55:51] have I never see you again
[55:53] remember the married supper is at hand
[55:57] and then the kingdom according to the
[56:00] promise
[56:01] is ready to be issued in
[56:03] the great Millennium the taking up of
[56:06] the church to the destroying of the
[56:07] wicked and the world under the Sixth
[56:10] seal to be purified by volcanic and take
[56:15] all the corruption and sin of the world
[56:17] and to mold her out again and bring
[56:19] forth a bright New Millennium for the
[56:22] age that is to come
[56:23] when we see all these great truthful
[56:26] revelation God in Christ Christ in the
[56:28] church the kingdom coming
[56:30] Adam and Eve redeemed back to the Garden
[56:32] of Eden and the representation of Christ
[56:34] and his bride and then the kingdom is
[56:37] going to be restored according to his
[56:38] promise praise be to God now by the
[56:41] revelation of the threefold mystery the
[56:43] secret and by the personal Vindicated
[56:46] word by his original headship
[56:52] not say well glory to God we shout
[56:54] hallelujah we saying that he did
[56:57] I'm a missionary I've been seven times
[57:00] frankly over the world see
[57:02] I sing heathens devils and everything
[57:04] else dancing Shout
[57:06] I've seen all kinds of fleshly
[57:07] manifestations that's carnal
[57:10] but I'm talking about the headship of
[57:13] Christ notice being personally
[57:15] identified by the original headship we
[57:18] have the answer to the devil's questions
[57:20] [Applause]
[57:23] we have the answer to the devil's
[57:26] question
[57:27] he
[57:28] Christ is risen and has paid the price
[57:32] and raising up the head of the body
[57:36] the devil can't stand it
[57:39] that's the reason these economical
[57:40] kingdoms are setting up that's the
[57:42] reason they're all coming into what
[57:43] they're doing now but there are much
[57:45] reasons howling the way he is
[57:47] his wickedness has been this scheme has
[57:51] been uncovered father risen resurrected
[57:55] Christ in the hardship over his body
[57:58] [Applause]
[58:01] you think I'm the final step or not
[58:06] we got the devil's answer
[58:07] [Applause]
[58:09] it was the Christ the word living in me
[58:12] not my idea it's his power not my idea
[58:15] it's his word he promised it here it is
[58:17] he said it would be here here it is we
[58:19] got his answer
[58:21] Christ is risen and has paid the price
[58:24] for our Redemption
[58:26] what God in Christ manifested he gave
[58:30] that flesh that and blood that in the
[58:34] blood might come to life and the flesh
[58:36] be redeemed that the god in this
[58:39] redeemed flesh could manifest his word
[58:42] for the day as he did in that day
[58:47] you see it
[58:49] oh man when you gotta stop notice it I
[58:52] am
[58:53] We Stand Justified
[58:56] in the presence of God
[58:58] as a drop of ink dropping into a
[59:01] uh a tub full of bleach you'll never
[59:04] find the stain of the ink no more
[59:07] it went somewhere he'll never come back
[59:10] again
[59:11] and when man is truly redeemed that
[59:13] predestinated seat that sees it and
[59:16] accepts it his sins are demolished it's
[59:20] gone and separated it's dropped into the
[59:24] ache of the of the blood of Jesus Christ
[59:27] and it's never to be remembered God
[59:29] forgets it and he stands in the Son and
[59:31] Daughter of God in the presence of God
[59:34] [Applause]
[59:38] how we are the sons of God
[59:43] now we will be we are now we're ready
[59:47] [Applause]
[59:49] God's opindicated himself God proves
[59:52] himself to his peace in this day
[59:55] how did the headship is here amen amen
[59:58] Christ there is a lord is here in the
[1:00:01] same power of his resurrection
[1:00:02] [Applause]
[1:00:04] manifesting himself there's the devil's
[1:00:07] answer that's the reason when this man
[1:00:09] said you're a drop dead the other day
[1:00:10] sitting here we can say come back live
[1:00:14] towards the holy spirit said so that's
[1:00:17] why I could do that little baby Hunter
[1:00:18] Mexico have been dead for about 15 hours
[1:00:21] when the vision comes they call it back
[1:00:23] to that right
[1:00:25] I said let the little baby live
[1:00:27] and the baby that the doctors over a
[1:00:30] statement died at nine o'clock that
[1:00:31] morning at 11 o'clock that night come
[1:00:33] back to Life's living today what is it
[1:00:36] good people the headship and the body
[1:00:40] has become one unit it's God manifested
[1:00:43] in his people

[1:01:20] rierson paid the price we're redeemed
[1:01:23] God's proved it Vindicated this thing
[1:01:26] and we stand justified in Christ before
[1:01:29] him because he cannot Place judgment or
[1:01:32] he's already judged that body
[1:01:34] and we're trying to pull it up here it
[1:01:37] is
[1:01:39] [Applause]

[1:33:52] if you have a need we're going to go to
[1:33:54] the Lord I
[1:33:55] I forgot to to read two praises and a
[1:33:59] prayer request at the beginning but I
[1:34:00] think
[1:34:01] I know that the Lord has everything in
[1:34:03] control
[1:34:05] so we had a praise turned in
[1:34:08] from Sister Lupe Alvarez she'd like to
[1:34:11] thank you for praying for her son Danny
[1:34:13] he's out of the hospital praise the Lord
[1:34:17] and

[1:34:21] prayer request for the Tim gassed for
[1:34:24] his missionary request
[1:34:26] and for Gilbert Flores family and
[1:34:28] unspoken need
[1:34:30] God be the glory for these and also
[1:34:33] praise turned in from brother Jeremy
[1:34:36] he says I praise God for the miracle
[1:34:37] waking up in the morning while camping
[1:34:40] our dog was suffocating
[1:34:42] and began to breathe again he's thankful
[1:34:45] for this

[1:34:53] would you come and and just pray for
[1:34:55] these needs come on up
[1:34:58] I believe
[1:35:00] God's still a Healer he's still a savior
[1:35:02] his his word says Jesus Christ the same
[1:35:05] yesterday today and forever
[1:35:07] so what he was back then he's the same
