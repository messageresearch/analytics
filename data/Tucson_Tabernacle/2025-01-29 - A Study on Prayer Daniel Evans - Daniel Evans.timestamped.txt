[0:01] you may
[0:04] take one by
[0:07] side the less you pray the harder it is
[0:11] to
[0:12] pray and she looked at me kind of funny
[0:16] and and um she she was taken back by
[0:20] what I said so then I had to get in
[0:24] touch with her later on I got in touch
[0:26] with her and she said I had a dream
[0:30] and she
[0:31] said you looked she said you were in my
[0:34] dream and she said you looked at
[0:37] me and she said you are
[0:40] Weeping because of my
[0:43] sins and she said and then what you told
[0:47] me came back the more you pray the more
[0:51] you want to
[0:53] pray and she said I've I've never heard
[0:58] anything that ever sounded like that in
[1:00] my life she said is is this like what
[1:02] Christianity is and I said yes sister it
[1:05] is and and I witnessed to her and I
[1:08] believe I gave her a Bible and um I pray
[1:11] that everything worked out and then
[1:14] that's the last I I ever lost touch with
[1:16] her obviously but wondering did that
[1:22] stick and where is that woman
[1:25] today another
[1:28] time um a man I've told this story
[1:31] before a man that was a prisoner pretty
[1:34] much his whole life real rough guy real
[1:36] big guy his name is Don Marsh I think I
[1:38] preached a sermon one Sunday night about
[1:41] him I had met him he was standing
[1:44] outside the brandom Tabernacle leaning
[1:47] up against the
[1:48] wall and I walked up to him and I I said
[1:52] uh hi brother I said I see you out out
[1:55] here standing here I I said I want to
[1:57] know who you are my name's Daniel Evans
[2:00] and and he said brother he said nobody
[2:02] ever talks to
[2:04] me and I said well I guess I'm a nobody
[2:08] then I said I'm talking to you and he
[2:11] says no brother he says I've done time
[2:14] he says I've done hard time he says I've
[2:17] got a past I said okay well that's all
[2:20] right I said we can put our past behind
[2:21] us and and I talked to him for a little
[2:23] while and it turns out he was in prison
[2:25] for violent
[2:26] crimes well he showed up at uh the
[2:30] church one day and and I was there
[2:32] during the middle of the day and he was
[2:35] upset and he walked in and he said my
[2:40] son was attacked and beat up by this
[2:43] other this other kid and he says he says
[2:47] brother I had to he says when I saw my
[2:49] son and and the shape that he was in he
[2:51] said I just had to leave he says and I
[2:53] came right down here and he says I'm
[2:55] goingon to kill
[2:57] him he says I need you to pray for me'
[3:04] I did one of the dumbest things I've
[3:05] ever done in my life I walked up to him
[3:08] and got right in his face and I said
[3:11] don't you dare waste my
[3:13] time I said if you're coming here to be
[3:17] delivered then God will deliver you I
[3:20] said but I don't want my time to be
[3:22] wasted on somebody like you who doesn't
[3:24] really believe and he looked at me he
[3:27] stepped back and this guy's huge Brother
[3:29] John dude Daniel yeah Daniel knew him
[3:32] well he said
[3:35] uh well he said that's good
[3:40] counsel Lord I
[3:42] said good I was ready man I was ready to
[3:46] block that right right hook and and run
[3:50] away I guess but he uh we
[3:55] prayed and uh everything worked out and
[3:58] then I became friends with him I was
[4:00] friends with him for years and he always
[4:01] told me he said brother that
[4:04] day that I came in and you prayed for me
[4:08] he said that temper and those violent
[4:10] tendencies they left me on that day and
[4:13] he says they've never come
[4:16] back Daniel Amen Daniel knew
[4:21] him and I look at I look at those times
[4:25] and then I look at
[4:27] times when my mother
[4:30] was dying of
[4:33] cancer and I fasted so much I lost like
[4:37] 25 or 30
[4:39] pounds and and in prayer all the time
[4:43] and fasting and seeing my mom suffer and
[4:46] like I've said before I've never seen a
[4:48] Christian that that could compare to my
[4:51] mom and seeing her wither away to
[4:55] nothing and then
[4:58] Die Why did the Lord not seemingly
[5:02] answer my prayers
[5:03] here but he did in another place there
[5:08] was another time that I was I was having
[5:10] a
[5:11] dream about a friend of
[5:13] mine and this is the only time that I
[5:17] can remember in my life that I I've
[5:18] heard a
[5:20] voice I had a dream and and I woke up
[5:23] from the
[5:24] dream and uh the dream was was him and
[5:28] me and a bunch of friends playing
[5:29] basketball together was just a dream
[5:31] that just a normal dream that you have
[5:35] and we were just shooting hoops and
[5:36] playing basketball and I woke up from
[5:38] the dream and I was thinking of
[5:41] him and and his
[5:44] wife and a
[5:48] voice spoke not like that voice that we
[5:52] hear when we're when we're in prayer
[5:54] that the Lord speaks to you but a voice
[5:57] that you can hear like you're hearing my
[5:58] voice now
[6:00] said these words said pray for
[6:05] them and I got up
[6:08] and prayed for
[6:10] him and
[6:13] uh I see now that the brother
[6:17] has turned and is having a very very
[6:20] hard life and is a dear dear friend
[6:22] since I was a kid and has made some
[6:25] really bad choices in his life and I can
[6:27] see why maybe the Lord wanted me to pray
[6:30] for him some 15 10 15 years
[6:34] ago and then I'm going to go through a
[6:37] few of these testimonies another time we
[6:40] were um at the brandom Tabernacle and
[6:42] just going to church I was on a
[6:44] Wednesday night like this and probably
[6:46] about as crowded as as this room is
[6:48] right
[6:49] now and we were listening to a tape of
[6:52] brother brandom and I got we got towards
[6:56] the end of the
[6:58] tape and I've always in my whole life
[7:01] I've struggled I've suffered with a
[7:03] stomach condition and I would buy those
[7:07] you know the cheap like toms the big one
[7:09] the contractor
[7:11] pack and then I I'd have a handful of
[7:13] them I'd bring them I put them in my
[7:15] pocket and then I I would I would go to
[7:17] work and and the my chest would feel
[7:21] like I was having a heart attack and it
[7:22] was the worst pain you could have and I
[7:25] would just lay my head across my desk
[7:27] and I would eat the TS and drink water
[7:29] and and it would go away well that night
[7:33] at the Tabernacle it was the end of the
[7:36] tape and brother brandom said lay your
[7:38] hands on one another like he did so many
[7:40] times most of you have heard him and it
[7:43] was like this and we all laid our hands
[7:46] on each other and nothing I didn't feel
[7:49] anything and a brother behind me we
[7:52] would we would sit with my family here
[7:54] and brother Steve klopp and his family
[7:56] would sit behind us and brother Steve
[7:59] put hand on me and I had my hand on the
[8:01] person in front of me and we put our
[8:03] hands on each other and prayed and then
[8:07] we ended and I didn't feel anything
[8:09] every everything was normal it was nice
[8:12] nice service so I walked out and we were
[8:15] um by our car and we were talking
[8:18] fellowshipping and brother Steve walked
[8:19] up to me and he said brother Dan I just
[8:21] want to tell you he says I really
[8:24] believe the Lord's going to heal your
[8:27] stomach and I said well thanks brother
[8:30] Steve you know I appreciate that and
[8:32] that was in I believe
[8:36] 2009
[8:38] 2010 and I've S I suffered with my
[8:41] stomach problem my whole life in high
[8:43] school I suffered with it and that was
[8:46] the end of it and it never came back
[8:49] that was the end of my stomach problems
[8:51] that night I didn't feel anything but
[8:54] something about brother Steve he had
[8:55] faith and he laid his hands on me and
[8:58] and I was healed amen and then another
[9:02] time we were Daniel was there and
[9:04] Daniel's a witness to this we were at
[9:07] the brandom Tabernacle and this is um
[9:10] this is fairly
[9:12] recently we um we were taking they were
[9:16] taking up the
[9:17] offering and I saw my brother Adam get
[9:20] up and Adam was in charge of all the
[9:22] first aid Adam gets up and he goes and
[9:26] grabs Dr Golden who is another friend of
[9:29] mine and they go over and I look down
[9:31] our row and there is brother James
[9:35] Jackson and brother James Jackson is
[9:40] dead I could see it I looked over I told
[9:43] Daniel I told uh brother Trevor Eman
[9:46] behind me I said he's gone he's dead you
[9:50] could tell his his shirt was wet he his
[9:53] mouth was open his eyes were open turns
[9:56] out he was dead for over 30 minutes
[9:59] and looked down
[10:01] there and we continued taking up the
[10:06] offering that was when he was noticed
[10:08] and we we were we continued and and I
[10:11] remember I bowed my
[10:14] head and I asked the Lord I said Lord
[10:17] raise him up and there was such a
[10:20] feeling of faith in that room there's
[10:21] probably 800 people there so a lot of
[10:24] people witnessed what I'm saying right
[10:25] now there was such a faith in there I
[10:28] wasay praying and I and what's funny is
[10:31] um Brother David Phillips was I was on
[10:35] the aisle and Brother David Phillips was
[10:36] a deacon and he bumped
[10:40] me and I looked up at him and he pointed
[10:42] and oh the the offering basket was right
[10:44] there so I took it and I gave it to
[10:47] Brother David and when he woke me up or
[10:52] um when he didn't wake me up but when he
[10:53] when I came out of my prayer I looked
[10:56] down and the color had come back into
[10:58] brother James
[11:00] and he was breathing and he was back and
[11:04] we gave a a testimony the testimony is
[11:07] online I um I got I got uh I interviewed
[11:12] the doctor I interviewed my brother I
[11:13] interviewed another brother that was
[11:15] there and the doctor said he was dead
[11:18] there was no pulse there was no
[11:20] respiration my brother said he was dead
[11:22] both of them had seen many many people
[11:25] die both of them were there it's amazing
[11:28] that you have a trauma a surgeon here
[11:30] and you have an experienced EMT there
[11:33] both at the same time and someone dies
[11:35] and comes back to life I don't think
[11:37] there's been a more well documented
[11:39] resurrection of the Dead than
[11:42] that why
[11:45] then and you see how many times have we
[11:48] heard brother
[11:50] brandom and brother brandham would my
[11:53] grandfather was with brother brandom and
[11:55] and they were fishing and he was Bitten
[11:57] on the on the foot by a snake brother
[12:00] brandham goes over to him and his his
[12:02] his foot is throbbing and it's hurting
[12:04] brother brandham goes over to him lays
[12:06] his hand on my grandfather and says a
[12:09] very simple little prayer Lord that it
[12:12] is written in your word that they shall
[12:13] tread on serpents and scorpions and
[12:15] nothing by any means will harm them and
[12:17] immediately my grandfather was healed
[12:20] and they fished the rest of the day
[12:22] another time my grandfather's and was
[12:24] car was
[12:26] stolen from Louisville
[12:30] and they got a ride they they were out
[12:32] to eat they got a ride to Brother
[12:33] brandom's house brother brandham gets
[12:35] everybody together in his den all my
[12:37] dad's family they kneel down and they
[12:40] pray and brother brandom says Lord would
[12:42] you send the Holy Spirit after this
[12:44] person that has stolen their car and
[12:47] would you condemn him and have him bring
[12:49] it back brother brandom loaned my
[12:53] grandpa my grandpa and my family the car
[12:55] they're driving about I don't know a
[12:58] couple hours later
[12:59] and the car was stolen in
[13:01] Louisville on the south side of the
[13:04] river brother brandom lived in
[13:06] Jeffersonville they get the brother
[13:08] braham's car they drive over my dad
[13:11] looks over in Jeffersonville and says
[13:14] look dad there's our
[13:16] car the man had brought it back yes amen
[13:20] the prayers and the power of the prayers
[13:23] and yet brother
[13:24] brandom was there and his little
[13:27] daughter was dying
[13:31] and there is little Sharon Rose and he
[13:33] said she was he said she was shaking he
[13:35] he her little fat leg was shaking and
[13:38] and she was in such pain that she would
[13:40] go crosseyed and here's brother brandom
[13:42] and he says Lord Heal my baby girl and
[13:45] he said the Lord just like brought down
[13:47] a sheet between him between brother
[13:51] brandom and
[13:53] God brother brandom said
[13:57] Lord the lord giveth the lord taketh
[14:00] away blessed be the name of the Lord and
[14:03] the little baby his own sweet baby died
[14:08] and he buried her on
[14:10] top of his wife who had just died a
[14:15] little bit
[14:16] earlier this man that all of these
[14:18] people would come through the prayer
[14:19] line and so many people would get healed
[14:22] why did his daughter
[14:26] die many miracles had happened
[14:30] before and then brother brandom had a
[14:32] stomach problem himself he had it his
[14:35] whole life struggled with it and and and
[14:38] it was just it was eating his stomach up
[14:40] and he he had ulcers and it was just a
[14:43] problem that he just dealt with all of
[14:45] the time and
[14:47] then on the wings of a snow white dove
[14:50] he preaches a
[14:51] sermon gives a testimony that he was up
[14:54] in Sabino
[14:56] Canyon and he has an experience
[15:00] and the Lord healed him of something
[15:03] that he had struggled with his whole
[15:05] life been less than 30 days later he
[15:09] died
[15:11] why what is it about
[15:16] prayer why does God do it sometimes and
[15:21] other times he doesn't do
[15:24] it I was listening to the seventh seal
[15:26] yesterday
[15:29] by brother
[15:31] brandham and he was giving the testimony
[15:33] of when he was up in the
[15:36] mountain up in Sabino
[15:39] Canyon and he was
[15:43] praying had both of his hands
[15:46] up and he was
[15:48] praying and something struck his
[15:53] hand and he looked and it was a
[15:57] sword and he made the state and this is
[15:59] the statement that just took me back it
[16:01] said and I just knew that brother
[16:03] Brandon was so into prayer he was he was
[16:06] so outside of
[16:10] himself he said did I fall
[16:13] asleep I don't
[16:16] know he said was it a vision he said I
[16:19] can't
[16:20] say all I know is it
[16:23] happened in
[16:26] prayer what is it about this man
[16:30] that seems different than anyone else
[16:32] brother brandham said the gift that I
[16:35] have he says if I have a gift he says
[16:39] the gift that I have is being able to
[16:40] get William brandom completely out of
[16:42] the
[16:44] way that's what prayer really is let me
[16:48] go back you don't have to put it up
[16:52] there I just read likewise the spirit
[16:54] also helps our infirmities for we know
[16:57] not what we should pray for as we
[17:00] should but we don't know what we should
[17:03] pray for but the spirit itself makes
[17:06] intercessions for us with
[17:09] groanings with words that can't be
[17:12] uttered and he that searches the heart
[17:15] knoweth what the mind of the spirit is
[17:18] because he makes intercessions for the
[17:20] Saints according to the will of God Amen
[17:25] think about brother brandom up there he
[17:26] was just
[17:27] praying he wasn't may I don't know what
[17:30] he was praying for he was just praying
[17:32] and then God places that in his in his
[17:35] hand and it didn't matter if he was
[17:38] asleep it didn't matter if it was a
[17:39] vision it didn't matter what it was to
[17:41] brother Brandon What mattered that is
[17:43] that he was in God's
[17:46] will the uh the Prophet
[17:50] Elijah
[17:52] he went
[17:54] up to the to the brook he called for a
[17:58] drought to come he went up to the brook
[18:02] and the brook dried up God sent him over
[18:05] to this widow woman this widow woman fed
[18:10] him
[18:13] and
[18:14] Elijah was able to through the will of
[18:17] God and and and through a vision that
[18:19] the the Lord was blessed this widow
[18:22] woman because of what she did fed her
[18:25] all the time that this drought was going
[18:27] on and this this widow woman's
[18:31] son she had this young young boy that
[18:34] was her
[18:35] her who her only
[18:38] family the young man
[18:42] dies and she brings
[18:45] him to
[18:48] Elijah First Kings 17:19 it says this
[18:53] and Elijah said unto her give me thy
[18:57] son and and he took him out of her
[19:01] bosom and carried him up into a loft
[19:04] where he Abode and laid him upon his own
[19:08] bed this man Elijah prayed we know that
[19:12] we just went through James we know how
[19:14] much Elijah prayed and Elijah he knew
[19:17] that since he prayed he knew that that
[19:20] bed that he slept on was
[19:24] blessed so he puts this Baby First Kings
[19:27] 17 20 he puts this young boy on this bed
[19:32] and then he cries out to the Lord and he
[19:34] said oh Lord my God hast thou also
[19:37] brought evil upon the Widow with whom I
[19:39] sojourn by slaying her
[19:41] son and he stretched himself upon the
[19:45] child three
[19:46] times and Cried unto the Lord and said
[19:49] oh Lord my God I pray thee let this
[19:52] child Soul come back into him again and
[19:55] the Lord heard the voice of Elijah and
[19:58] the soul the child came back into him
[20:00] again and he revived
[20:03] Hallelujah the
[20:05] prayer of a righteous man and then
[20:08] Elijah Elijah's Protege
[20:11] Elisha we know the story of the
[20:13] shunamite woman she was kind to him and
[20:15] she built this room off of her house
[20:18] where the man of God could come and stay
[20:22] and then one day he asked his servant
[20:24] gesi he says he says what can we do for
[20:26] this lady she's done so much for us can
[20:28] can I go and talk to the king for can I
[20:31] can I do can I can I help her with
[20:33] talking to the the the Master of Arms
[20:36] what can I do to help this lady and gesi
[20:39] says she doesn't have any children
[20:41] Elijah
[20:43] Elisha and her husband's
[20:46] old so
[20:49] then Elijah goes straight Elisha goes
[20:53] straight to her we don't have any record
[20:54] of Elijah praying Elisha praying he goes
[20:58] straight to to her and says you're going
[21:00] to have a
[21:02] son and she has this son just like the
[21:07] skin
[21:08] tag I didn't pray about it I just knew
[21:12] there was something about it that God
[21:13] just told me it was going to go away and
[21:16] here is Elisha and with the same Spirit
[21:19] he says God's going to give you a
[21:21] child this she has this child the child
[21:24] grows up he's out plowing with his dad
[21:27] and he he gets a headache and he says he
[21:29] says Dad my head hurts my head so he he
[21:32] takes a servant he says take take him in
[21:34] to his mom she comes in or he comes into
[21:36] her he lays down on her on her lap She
[21:39] lays him down on her lap and she and the
[21:40] boy
[21:42] dies this one that God had given them
[21:44] I'm sure she loved him so
[21:49] much so
[21:51] then second Kings chapter 4 we'll read
[21:55] the story verse 29
[21:59] then he said to GES G up thy loins and
[22:01] and take my staff so so the shunamite
[22:04] woman comes and and she tells Eli Elisha
[22:07] what had
[22:10] happened then Elisha says to his servant
[22:13] Gesa G up thy loins and take take my
[22:16] staff in thine hand and go thy way if
[22:19] thou meet any man salute him not and if
[22:21] any salute thee answer him not again and
[22:23] lay my staff upon the face of the
[22:27] child this man Elisha who had prayed so
[22:30] much he knew not because he thought
[22:32] something great of himself but he knew
[22:34] that whatever he touched was blessed
[22:36] that's why we have prayer
[22:38] claws it's perfectly scriptural
[22:40] according to this scripture right here
[22:42] take my staff and lay it on the
[22:47] child and the mother and and the mother
[22:51] of the child said as the Lord
[22:53] liveth and thy soul liveth I will not
[22:56] leave thee and he arose and he followed
[22:58] her back to her son and gesi passed on
[23:00] before them and laid the staff upon the
[23:03] face of the child but there was neither
[23:05] voice nor
[23:07] hearing wherefore he went in again to
[23:09] meet him and he told him saying the
[23:12] child is not awake and when Elisha was
[23:15] come into the house behold the child was
[23:18] dead and laid upon his bed do you
[23:22] remember the story of
[23:24] Elijah and the shunamite woman she took
[23:28] that child and laid him on the bed of
[23:31] this man of God
[23:34] Elisha he went in therefore and shut the
[23:36] door upon them Twain and prayed unto the
[23:42] Lord and he went up and lay upon the
[23:45] child remember what Elijah
[23:48] did Elisha must have known that
[23:52] story that his
[23:55] teacher Elijah had taught him
[23:59] the testimony that he gave it's why
[24:01] these testimonies they're
[24:03] important that we hear them when we know
[24:06] it can be done and here's Elisha he does
[24:07] the same thing and Elisha was come to
[24:09] the house behold the child was dead and
[24:11] laid upon his bed and he went in and
[24:13] shut the door upon them Twain and prayed
[24:15] unto the Lord and he went and lay upon
[24:17] the child and put his mouth upon his
[24:19] mouth and his eyes upon his eyes and his
[24:22] hands upon his hands and stretched
[24:24] himself upon the child and the Flesh of
[24:26] the child waxed warm L and then he
[24:30] returned but he didn't wake
[24:33] up the child didn't
[24:36] revive but warmth came in him and he
[24:40] walked back and forth Elijah was was
[24:43] struggling well Elijah when he prayed
[24:45] for him he just rose up and how come
[24:47] it's not working for
[24:49] me he continued to
[24:53] pray he returned and walked in the house
[24:56] to and fro and went up and stretched
[24:58] himself on him and then the child
[25:00] sneezed seven times and the child opened
[25:02] his
[25:03] eyes another answered
[25:07] prayer and then this
[25:10] man
[25:12] James 5:
[25:14] 16 says this confess your
[25:17] faults one to
[25:20] another and pray one for another amen
[25:25] that you may be healed the effectual
[25:26] fervent prayer of a righteous man
[25:28] availeth much it makes a
[25:31] difference this Elijah was a man subject
[25:34] to like passions as we are the one I
[25:35] told about the widow
[25:38] woman and he prayed earnestly that it
[25:40] might not rain and it didn't rain on the
[25:42] earth for the space of three and a half
[25:44] three years and six months and he prayed
[25:46] again and Heaven gave the rain and the
[25:49] Earth brought forth her
[25:51] fruit another answered prayer why why
[25:56] did he answer this prayer
[25:59] and not these other
[26:01] prayers the
[26:03] answer is in the word and I believe it's
[26:06] in that scripture that I read first but
[26:08] first let's go to First Peter chapter
[26:10] 3 and I think this will start to get us
[26:13] there 1 Peter chapter
[26:16] 3:1 likewise you wives be in subjection
[26:20] to your own husbands that if any obey
[26:23] not the word that they also May without
[26:26] the word be won by the convers of the
[26:29] wives while they behold your Chase
[26:31] conversation coupled with fear whose
[26:34] adorning let it not be that outward
[26:37] adorning of the plated hair and a
[26:39] wearing of gold or putting on of apparel
[26:42] but let it be the hidden man of the
[26:45] heart in that which is not corruptible
[26:48] even the ornament of a Meek and quiet
[26:50] Spirit which is in the sight of God of
[26:53] great price for after this manner in the
[26:57] old time time the holy women also who
[26:59] trusted in God adorned themselves being
[27:03] in subjection to their their own
[27:05] husbands even as Sarah obeyed Abraham
[27:09] calling him Lord James is getting to a
[27:11] point this is husband and wife
[27:15] here even as Sarah obeyed Abraham
[27:17] calling him Lord whose daughters you are
[27:20] as long as you do well and aren not
[27:22] afraid with any amazement likewise you
[27:24] husbands dwell with them according to
[27:26] knowledge giving unto the wife as unto
[27:30] the weaker vessel and as being heirs
[27:33] together of Grace that your prayers be
[27:35] not
[27:38] hindered a fight between a husband and a
[27:40] wife your prayers are
[27:43] hindered love should take precedence
[27:46] over everything including getting your
[27:51] way if you start if you start giving
[27:56] then she'll start giving
[27:58] love will breed love and strife will be
[28:01] breed strife and this fighting will
[28:04] hinder our
[28:06] prayers in our family and everywhere
[28:08] else finally be ye all of One
[28:11] mind James tells this story and now he's
[28:14] saying okay now
[28:16] you be of one mind having compassion one
[28:19] of another love as Brethren be pitiful
[28:22] be courteous not rendering evil for
[28:24] evil or railing for railing but contrary
[28:27] wise blessing knowing that you are there
[28:30] unto called that you should inherit a
[28:32] blessing again conflict and fighting
[28:35] will hinder your
[28:37] prayers why because it becomes about
[28:40] your own
[28:42] ideas
[28:44] Unity among Christians can only be can
[28:48] only become
[28:51] real if we truly desire God's will
[28:55] sister Shirley and I were talking before
[28:57] service
[28:59] brother brandham said if I have a gift
[29:01] as I said it's to get William brandham
[29:03] out of the way and if there is to be any
[29:05] Unity among Christian people or any
[29:08] people at all we have to set aside our
[29:11] own thinking we have to set aside our
[29:13] own desires even as a family when we
[29:15] fight somebody has to set aside what
[29:18] they
[29:19] want and that is the Christian
[29:23] way otherwise we have different
[29:26] divisions of Christianity fighting
[29:28] against each other not supporting or
[29:30] maybe not fighting against each other
[29:32] always but not supporting each
[29:35] other and because it's about our own
[29:37] desires it's about our own
[29:40] feelings and that's what causes the
[29:43] conflict and when we get down and pray
[29:45] we might be praying for our own our own
[29:49] wants and not setting aside our wants
[29:51] and really getting ourselves out of the
[29:53] way and saying Lord what do you want we
[29:56] forget about how go great God God is and
[29:59] how great God is is we want to get into
[30:03] his program and if we can get into his
[30:06] program that's when the Deb are raised
[30:10] that's when the prayers are answered is
[30:12] because it's his choice and not our
[30:15] choice I've heard so many times people
[30:18] say do you think God
[30:19] would wait a minute you can fill in
[30:22] whatever you
[30:23] want do you think God would want this
[30:28] well are you speaking for
[30:31] God have you prayed and have you got an
[30:33] answer from God on these things it may
[30:37] sound
[30:38] strange but we are not
[30:41] God it's not God's job to do what we
[30:45] want it is our job to do what God
[30:50] wants verse number eight or 26 I'm
[30:53] sorry likewise the spirit also helpeth
[30:57] our in
[30:58] infirmities I'm sorry I'm going back to
[31:01] Romans I want to read it again likewise
[31:04] the spirit also helpeth our infirmities
[31:06] for we know not what we should pray for
[31:09] as we ought but the spirit itself makes
[31:13] intercessions for us with groanings
[31:14] which cannot be uttered and he that
[31:16] searches the hearts knoweth what is the
[31:18] mind of the spirit because he makes
[31:21] intercessions for the Saints according
[31:23] to the will of God so when we are
[31:25] praying we need to stop asking asking
[31:28] the Lord to do
[31:30] something unless it's the spirit
[31:32] speaking through
[31:34] us and then we
[31:37] ask but the hardest thing is not to pray
[31:41] for someone to be healed is to pray for
[31:44] God's Will and then if we can truly get
[31:46] ourselves out of the way then we will
[31:48] know what God's will is and we can say
[31:50] rise up and walk dead man you rise up
[31:53] God this is God speaking this isn't me
[31:56] speaking but instead we get our own
[31:59] desires we want our own way we want I
[32:03] want my own music I want my own pews I
[32:05] want my own Doctrine I want my own
[32:08] preacher I want my own religion I want
[32:11] it the way I want
[32:13] it that is the biggest failure of
[32:16] humankind it's the biggest failure of
[32:19] all of us we want our way and then we'd
[32:22] make God into this as brother brandom
[32:25] called him an Aaron
[32:26] boy and that's not right we should be
[32:30] his Aaron
[32:31] boy we should set aside our way of
[32:34] thinking Lord what do you want what is
[32:37] your perfect will Lord I I Surrender my
[32:40] will and that's when you see things
[32:42] happen and it can be a a fight between a
[32:46] husband and a
[32:47] wife whatever it is Lord what is your
[32:53] will for we know not what we should
[32:57] should pray for is what the Apostle Paul
[33:00] said as we
[33:03] should read it again for we know not
[33:06] what we should pray
[33:08] for but the spirit itself makes
[33:11] intercessions for us with groanings
[33:13] which cannot be othered wow wow and he
[33:17] that searches the hearts know what is
[33:19] the mind of the spirit so he that this
[33:22] holy spirit that knows our hearts he
[33:25] knows what's the mind of God so our role
[33:28] is just to get into his way of thinking
[33:30] just to get ourselves out of the way our
[33:32] own wants and our own desires and
[33:34] sacrifice
[33:35] ourselves Romans 12 121 my favorite
[33:39] scripture it says make your body a
[33:42] Living Sacrifice to God which is your
[33:45] reasonable service that is the hardest
[33:48] thing we have desires we have wants but
[33:51] get ourselves out of the way and get
[33:54] into his way of
[33:56] thinking disagree ments are normal and
[33:59] and many
[34:00] times they're healthy you should bring
[34:03] up concerns of course we all should
[34:06] because none of us are perfect but when
[34:08] they cause
[34:10] division then our prayers are
[34:14] hindered it could be in a church it
[34:16] could be a husband and a
[34:18] wife that's when the prayers don't work
[34:22] because they are self-serving amen
[34:25] listen to Christ's prayer for the church
[34:27] John chapter
[34:29] 17 verse 20 it says this Jesus now this
[34:32] is the last time this is the last prayer
[34:35] that we know
[34:37] of from Jesus he says neither I pray for
[34:40] these alone verse number 29 I'm I'm
[34:44] sorry 20 you're right neither pray I for
[34:47] these alone but for them also which
[34:49] Shall Believe on me through their word
[34:51] that they all may be
[34:53] one as thou father art in me and I in
[34:57] thee that they also may be one in us
[35:00] that the world may believe that thou has
[35:03] sent me
[35:05] whoa their
[35:08] Unity is going to prove that Jesus
[35:10] Christ is the
[35:13] Messiah that they may also be one in us
[35:16] that the world may believe that thou
[35:19] Hast sent me and the glory which thou
[35:22] gavest me I have given them that they
[35:24] may be one even as We Are One
[35:28] in them i in them and thou in me that
[35:32] they may be made perfect in one and that
[35:35] the world may know that thou has sent me
[35:38] says it again and thou Hast and Hast
[35:41] loved them as thou has loved
[35:44] me father I will that they also whom
[35:49] thou G whom thou Hast given me be with
[35:52] me where I am that they may behold my
[35:55] glory which thou Hast given me for thou
[35:57] lovest me before the foundation of the
[36:00] world Jesus in his prayer is interceding
[36:03] on the behalf of the ones that he loves
[36:06] remember job job interceded on behalf of
[36:09] his children he made sacrifices not even
[36:11] knowing what their sins were he
[36:13] sacrificed just in case that they had
[36:15] sinned so we if we can truly get into
[36:18] the spirit of Christ if we can truly get
[36:21] into him then we are able to make that
[36:24] prayer of intercession for each other
[36:27] because it's not us speaking we can't
[36:30] intercede there's no there's no
[36:33] Mary no Peter no James no John as the
[36:37] Catholic Church says but that same
[36:42] spirit that can speak through us through
[36:46] our prayers if we can set aside our own
[36:49] thinking and this is exactly what Jesus
[36:52] is doing here he says oh righteous
[36:54] father the world hath not known thee but
[36:56] I have known thee and these have known
[36:59] that thou Hast sent me and I have
[37:01] declared unto them thy name and will
[37:04] declare it that the love wherewith thou
[37:08] Hast loved me may be in
[37:12] them in i in
[37:16] them amen I'll go down a little rabbit
[37:20] hole real
[37:21] quick so this doesn't work with the
[37:23] trinitarian argument that there are
[37:26] three independent
[37:28] manifestations of
[37:30] God that's the Holy Spirit that's in us
[37:34] and Jesus here says that I am going to
[37:37] be in them so it kind of torpedoes that
[37:40] ship as far as as as far as the
[37:42] trinitarian way of thinking but if we
[37:45] have Unity if we're standing together in
[37:48] one common cause then we need to pray
[37:51] about what that cause is and how do we
[37:54] sincerely pray
[37:57] back to Romans again for we know not
[38:00] what we should pray for as we ought but
[38:02] the spirit itself makes intercessions
[38:04] for us with groanings which cannot be
[38:05] othered the key to prayer is to get our
[38:08] own desires out of the way and to seek
[38:11] the desires of God what is the desire of
[38:14] Christ we know we just read it his last
[38:17] prayer that his disci disciples heard
[38:19] that they would be
[38:21] one and how can we all be one it's not
[38:24] by my leadership in this church it's not
[38:26] by Brother brand leadership or by
[38:28] anyone's leadership it's only by the
[38:31] leadership of the Holy
[38:32] Ghost that's how we can be one for we
[38:36] know not what we should pray for as we
[38:38] should but the spirit makes
[38:46] intercessions I'll skip down let's go
[38:48] down to John
[38:49] 14:12 says this verily verily I say unto
[38:52] you he that believeth on me the works
[38:54] that I that that I do shall he do also
[38:57] and Greater Works than these shall he do
[38:59] because I go to my father and whatsoever
[39:02] you shall ask in my name that will I do
[39:05] that the father may be glorified in the
[39:09] son not that you're going to get what
[39:11] you
[39:13] want but it's so the father would be
[39:15] glorified through Jesus Christ that is
[39:18] why he answers
[39:21] prayer if you ask anything St John a
[39:24] couple verses later if you ask anything
[39:27] in my name I will do
[39:30] it right after he says that the father
[39:33] may be glorified in the son and if this
[39:35] is so that you ask anything in my name
[39:39] and I'll do it and I'm running out of
[39:42] time so I'm going to go through these
[39:43] scriptures quickly Romans 12:12 I'll
[39:46] read the NIV version of this one it says
[39:48] Be Joyful in Hope patient in Affliction
[39:52] faithful in prayer Philippians 4:6
[39:58] again I'll read the ni IV it says '
[39:59] don't be anxious about anything but in
[40:01] every situation by prayer and petition
[40:03] with Thanksgiving present with
[40:06] Thanksgiving present your request to God
[40:08] and the peace of God which transcends
[40:10] all understanding will guard your hearts
[40:13] and your minds in Christ
[40:16] Jesus Colossians 4:2 King James version
[40:19] says continue in prayer and watch in the
[40:22] same with
[40:24] Thanksgiving Philippians 5:17 says pray
[40:27] pray without
[40:30] ceasing second Timothy
[40:32] 1:3 says I thank God whom I serve Paul
[40:35] speaking from my forefathers with pure
[40:38] conscience that without ceasing I have
[40:41] remembrance of you in my prayers night
[40:44] and day praying all the
[40:47] time James 5:13 says any is any among
[40:51] you Afflicted let them let him
[40:53] pray is any marry let him sing Psalms is
[40:57] any sick among you let him call for the
[40:59] Elders of the church and let them pray
[41:01] over him anointing him with oil in the
[41:03] name of the Lord and the prayer of faith
[41:04] shall save the
[41:06] sick the Lord shall raise him up and if
[41:09] you have committed sins they shall be
[41:11] forgiven him confess your faults one to
[41:14] another and pray one for another that
[41:16] you may be healed the effectual fervent
[41:19] prayer of a righteous man Avail of much
[41:28] prayers that we have we bring them
[41:32] before God but
[41:34] first we need to know God's
[41:37] Will and the only way to know God's will
[41:40] is to consecrate ourselves to him and to
[41:42] ask him Lord what do you want and it's
[41:45] the hardest thing in the world to get
[41:47] yourself out of the way it is the
[41:49] hardest thing in the world to get your
[41:50] wants out of the way do you think God
[41:53] would want somebody to
[41:55] Suffer Well
[41:57] we shouldn't ask those
[41:59] questions because he did say that
[42:02] suffering perfects
[42:05] us so maybe he does I don't think he
[42:08] wants us to hurt but he knows what's
[42:10] right he knows what's good he knows the
[42:14] end Ephesians 6 I'll go through this one
[42:18] quickly we all know this and we we've
[42:21] probably heard many many sermons on this
[42:23] Ephesians
[42:24] 6:18 613
[42:27] 613 it says this wherefore take unto you
[42:31] the whole armor of God that you may able
[42:32] be able to withstand the withstand in
[42:35] the evil day and having done all to
[42:38] stand stand therefore having your loins
[42:41] G about with truth and have having the
[42:42] breast plate of righteousness we've
[42:44] heard this how many sermons have we
[42:46] heard on this above all your feet should
[42:48] be shod with the preparation of the
[42:50] gospel of peace above all taking the
[42:52] shield of Faith wherewith you shall be
[42:54] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[42:56] the wicked and take the helmet of
[42:58] salvation and the sword of the spirit
[43:00] which is the word of God we know that
[43:03] this armor of the holy spirit that
[43:06] someone puts on as a Christian but don't
[43:11] forget the the next verse is probably
[43:14] the most important of all of them
[43:16] praying
[43:18] always how do you think you can put on
[43:20] the helmet of
[43:21] salvation praying always with all prayer
[43:24] and supplication in the
[43:30] spirit and watching there unto with all
[43:33] perseverance and supplications for All
[43:34] Saints and for me that other utterance
[43:38] may be given unto me that I may open my
[43:40] mouth boldly to make known The Mystery
[43:44] of the
[43:45] Gospel Paul's saying that the words may
[43:47] be given to me that I might open my
[43:49] mouth boldly to make known this mystery
[43:52] that I might speak the
[43:54] words of God and not the words of
[43:58] Paul but the
[44:00] words that are inspired by the Lord
[44:02] Jesus and those come through prayer how
[44:06] many times I was I was sharing with
[44:08] sister Shirley how many times have I
[44:10] been in prayer just talking to the Lord
[44:14] and something came out of my
[44:17] mouth like what in the world was
[44:22] that I'll share I was I was praying
[44:26] about
[44:28] I don't know Daniel's laughing um 12
[44:32] years ago maybe Daniel knows a
[44:35] story I was I was at I was um at work in
[44:40] the closet that I would pray
[44:42] in and I was just praying my heart out
[44:45] just like I always do in worshiping and
[44:47] all of a sudden I prayed Lord if you
[44:51] want me to preach your gospel then and I
[44:54] said a few other
[44:56] words and I got up I didn't believe in
[44:59] Preachers I didn't like
[45:01] preachers it's like what in the world
[45:04] did I just
[45:08] say and now I know why I prayed
[45:12] that it was the Holy Spirit not Daniel
[45:16] Evans it was the Holy Spirit speaking
[45:20] through me in private in
[45:23] quiet I'm like wow what in the
[45:27] world was
[45:31] that I'll uh I'll I'll
[45:35] close on this and brother Josiah you and
[45:38] the team can come I talked this morning
[45:40] I don't see sister Amilia here she's one
[45:42] of our missing people I talked with her
[45:45] son Adam today he's he's incarcerated U
[45:50] and uh for a long
[45:54] time and he gave me a testimony this
[45:56] morning that he
[45:57] struggled with cigarettes smoking
[46:01] cigarettes and he would get on his knees
[46:04] and he would pray and pray and pray Lord
[46:06] take these cigarettes away from me and
[46:08] he had smoked for really decades
[46:11] and he would stop for a while and then
[46:16] then it would stir back up in him to
[46:18] smoke more and one day he was praying
[46:21] and he said he said the these words he
[46:23] said' Lord he says I've been lying to
[46:25] You' he said 'if I wanted to stop then I
[46:29] would
[46:31] have and he said it was the Lord then
[46:33] the Lord spoke back to him and
[46:37] said okay now are you done
[46:42] trying and then he said if so then I'll
[46:45] take
[46:47] over so Adam was was he he got up and he
[46:51] he said as he was praying he said that
[46:54] the the the the desire for smoking
[46:57] started to get more and more for for
[47:00] tobacco and he was he was down and and
[47:02] he was praying and and he felt like the
[47:04] Lord was speaking to him and he wanted a
[47:06] cigarette so bad right
[47:08] then so he was able to get through the
[47:11] night without a cigarette the next
[47:13] morning the guards come in and he he
[47:16] used the he used the term the guards
[47:18] told him roll up because you're going to
[47:20] what's called SMU and I guess a supermax
[47:23] is what it was you're going somewhere
[47:25] else
[47:27] so they took Adam to this
[47:29] supermax where there was no tobacco
[47:34] allowed so he gets he gets in there or
[47:39] there they didn't sell tobacco in there
[47:41] he gets in there and he had all of his
[47:43] personal stuff and there was a pouch of
[47:45] tobacco in his personal stuff and they
[47:48] lost it they lost his personal personal
[47:51] um things so he had no access to it so
[47:55] he was in this supermax for 9 months and
[47:58] couldn't smoke if he wanted to smoke he
[48:00] asked the Lord he said Lord I'm tired of
[48:03] it I'm done with it Lord says you ready
[48:05] for me to do it he says yes now you
[48:10] can't so nine months went by and the
[48:14] Lord delivered him from the
[48:17] tobacco and the urge would come up and
[48:19] he'd say I'm not going back and he told
[48:21] me today he said that was a 24y year
[48:24] marriage I had with cigarettes
[48:27] and he says it ended during those nine
[48:31] months so it gave him
[48:34] faith and he said the next thing he said
[48:39] was violence you remember the story
[48:41] about Don Marsh I told
[48:43] earlier he said I I I fought he said I
[48:47] was violent because that's what you had
[48:49] to do in prison and the Lord laid it on
[48:53] his heart to put away violence like he
[48:56] did smoking
[48:59] intimidation and rage was inside of him
[49:03] he intimidated people and he was a
[49:05] respected person in his in his
[49:09] gang and the Lord worked him worked on
[49:13] him on that for a while and he was
[49:15] delivered by that he was delivered from
[49:19] that spirit so then the Lord tested him
[49:23] and there was a black man he was part of
[49:25] the Mexican gang and there was a black
[49:27] man that was part of The Black Gang and
[49:29] this man had it out for him so he
[49:33] challenged Adam to a
[49:35] fight he he uh he wanted to fight him in
[49:38] the yard and Adam told me he says you
[49:41] show up for that fight or there's going
[49:43] to be consequences not just going to be
[49:44] one guy you're fighting now it's going
[49:46] to be the whole gang and they're going
[49:48] to beat you up or kill you so you better
[49:50] just go fight and if you you lose you
[49:52] lose so Adam goes out there and he says
[49:55] I'm not going to do it
[49:57] and then it started getting the group
[49:58] stirred up because he was a leader so
[50:00] now you have the Mexican gang over here
[50:02] and you have The Black Gang over here
[50:04] and they're starting to get fired up and
[50:05] they're they're going to fight and he
[50:07] says well let me just talk to the guy so
[50:11] he goes up to
[50:12] him and the guy says yeah he says you
[50:16] messed up my TV I know you did Adam's
[50:19] like I didn't mess up your television I
[50:21] didn't do that he says yeah you did and
[50:25] Adam's like I didn't do
[50:28] it and so what Adam did was he says hey
[50:32] I have a
[50:33] television you know you can have
[50:36] mine Adam said you don't do that it
[50:40] shows weakness and his gang
[50:43] members would would not back him up his
[50:46] gang members would say hey man you're
[50:47] showing weakness so but Adam says I'm
[50:51] going to do it so then the uh the the
[50:54] the black Clan over here they're going
[50:56] to to still um take out Adam and one of
[51:00] the black
[51:02] guys goes to the gang when and says no
[51:05] no no don't do it to him he's a
[51:08] Christian
[51:10] so the the fight didn't
[51:14] happen and then the the guy still didn't
[51:16] like him ad Adam gave up his television
[51:18] the guy still didn't like him and then
[51:22] Adam gets transferred to another cell
[51:25] block and he starts witnessing to the
[51:27] people and he starts doing well there
[51:29] again staying away from the fighting and
[51:32] he looks out in the yard months later
[51:35] and there's that same
[51:37] guy and Adam waves at him and he was not
[51:41] over it so he goes over over there and
[51:44] now they have the two gangs start to get
[51:47] heated heated up
[51:49] again and Adam says and he goes to talk
[51:53] to him and he says listen he says he
[51:55] says look what I've done for you over
[51:57] the month the time he says I helped you
[51:59] with your bunk he says I gave you food
[52:01] when you were hungry he says ould I do
[52:03] that against somebody that I was against
[52:05] and he said he still told him that you
[52:07] tore up my TV and Adam was like listen
[52:10] you know I gave you I'm sorry I told you
[52:12] you gave him the TV then he gave it
[52:14] actually gave it to him this time and he
[52:16] says he says that they they kind of made
[52:21] made
[52:22] amends and the guy still doesn't like
[52:24] him well then the guy gets transferred
[52:25] away and Adam said that he started
[52:29] preaching to the people around like we
[52:31] can't do this and he asked he asked the
[52:34] the the Christian group he says have you
[52:36] ever got into violence have you ever got
[52:39] into a fight and knew it was from
[52:41] God they all said no Adam used that
[52:47] testimony in the fights in to to subdue
[52:50] the fights in the prison and he's and
[52:52] all of them said no we had never fought
[52:53] for a righteous reason and Adam said now
[52:56] it's been months since there has been a
[52:58] fight in this yard and these gang
[53:01] members in his unit in his block there
[53:05] has not been a fight now for months and
[53:08] months because of Adam's testimony and
[53:11] he says brother that's going on right
[53:13] now and he says I've never seen someone
[53:16] who's really living the word of God go
[53:18] back to
[53:20] violence because Adam prayed and he was
[53:24] praying about it and then the Lord
[53:26] worked it out and did the exact
[53:29] opposite I see
[53:31] Christians me I see Christians who have
[53:34] a Wonder wonderful understanding of the
[53:36] word but they lack the life that comes
[53:39] with the revelation of the word and
[53:42] what's lacking is that because their
[53:44] prayer life is
[53:46] lacking what do you have what do you
[53:48] have to pray
[53:49] for you know you say Lord what do I pray
[53:53] for pray for
[53:54] everything all the promises in the Bible
[53:57] depend on a constant connection with God
[54:01] and the way that we have to do that is
[54:03] through prayer and prayer ultimately
[54:06] produces
[54:09] obedience am I to heal this person in
[54:11] the name of Jesus Christ the lord lays
[54:14] it on your heart then heal him am I to
[54:16] cast out this demon then cast it
[54:19] out but if
[54:21] not if it's not will God's Will and it
[54:24] may not be then you stay silent we seek
[54:28] God's will
[54:30] first and then he will
[54:34] speak
[54:36] likewise the spirit also helps our
[54:38] infirmities for we know not what we
[54:40] should pray for as we ought but the
[54:42] spirit itself makes intercessions for us
[54:45] which
[54:46] groanings for us with groanings which
[54:49] cannot be uttered and he that searches
[54:51] the hearts knoweth what is the mind of
[54:53] the spirit because he maketh
[54:54] intercessions for the saint Saints
[54:56] according to the will of God
[55:01] Amen so
[55:03] prayer brothers and sisters is obedience
[55:06] it's surrender to God and then once that
[55:11] surrender to God happens he'll do things
[55:14] that you never ever thought you would
[55:16] ever do and he'll do things that you
[55:18] never thought would were possible
[55:21] Adam fought and that's what gave him
[55:25] status but but he gave that
[55:27] up he gave it up and then the
[55:31] Lord took his part and then bless the
[55:35] entire
[55:36] block taking the violence away it's
[55:39] amazing what'll happen if we just truly
[55:41] surrender to God brother you
[55:47] say you all
[55:50] stand he's
[55:52] God that's the song
[55:58] when I come into His
[56:01] presence I
[56:03] humble
[56:05] myself I lift up both my
[56:09] hands and I
[56:12] begin to
[56:15] worship
[56:20] him I
[56:23] worship him when I come
[56:27] when I come into His
[56:30] presence I
[56:32] humble
[56:35] myself I lift up both my
[56:38] hands and I
[56:42] begin to
[56:45] worship
[56:48] him oh I
[56:52] worship
[56:54] him for for all that he's done for
[57:00] [Applause]
[57:02] me
[57:04] redeemed and set me
[57:08] free and
[57:11] because just
[57:14] because
[57:16] he's
[57:21] God when I come into His presence
[57:26] I
[57:27] humble
[57:29] myself remembering what he's done oh the
[57:34] victories he's one so I'll
[57:38] praise
[57:41] him so I'll
[57:45] praise him when I come when I come into
[57:51] His presence I
[57:54] humble myself
[57:57] remembering what he's done all the
[58:01] victories he's won so I
[58:05] praise
[58:08] him oh I'll
[58:11] [Music]
[58:13] praise
[58:14] him for all he's done for
[58:21] me
[58:23] redeemed and set me be
[58:28] free and
[58:31] because just
[58:33] because he's
[58:37] God for all he's
[58:40] done for all is
[58:44] done for
[58:47] me
[58:48] redeemed and set me
[58:53] free and because
[58:57] just
[58:59] because he's
[59:03] [Music]
[59:08] G about having a
[59:11] meeting and he said this he
[59:16] said the Lord willing will have some
[59:18] great Services out there with the Lord's
[59:20] blessings on us as you pray for
[59:22] us that's the only way that we can have
[59:25] it is is when you
[59:27] pray just one of us praying will help
[59:31] but when we all pray together that's
[59:33] when God will go to moving when we all
[59:36] go to praying that's his promise and we
[59:39] know his promises are true can you
[59:44] imagine if we all could have such a walk
[59:47] with God and I seek that so much from
[59:50] myself if we could all have such a walk
[59:53] with
[59:54] God that we could all pray together in
[59:58] these hard decisions that we make in
[1:00:00] life whether it be little things
[1:00:04] like the color that's going to be on the
[1:00:07] on the walls and and and the little
[1:00:10] decisions that we make every day or
[1:00:12] whether it be big things like is this
[1:00:15] person if we could pray for this person
[1:00:18] to be healed or or that person to meet
[1:00:22] the right mate but if we could really
[1:00:27] agree on something Jesus even said that
[1:00:30] if just
[1:00:31] two will
[1:00:33] agree but you have to have the Holy
[1:00:36] Spirit to agree you have to have God's
[1:00:39] will to agree or that's not even
[1:00:41] possible but if we can agree on those
[1:00:44] things
[1:00:46] then we can see great things happen I
[1:00:49] believe they had that at the day of
[1:00:51] Pentecost I believe they had that in the
[1:00:53] book of Acts they may not have they may
[1:00:56] not have agreed have they may have
[1:01:00] argued sometimes but they came back
[1:01:03] together in love and in unity and in the
[1:01:07] Holy Spirit and great things happen I
[1:01:09] just wonder if one day that we will see
[1:01:12] that when we have decisions to make we
[1:01:14] actually pray about them and we set
[1:01:17] aside our own
[1:01:19] thinking and we make decisions and we
[1:01:23] make
[1:01:23] prayers that it wouldn't be us speaking
[1:01:25] speaking it would be the Holy Spirit
[1:01:27] speaking through US wouldn't you love to
[1:01:29] see that maybe we'll see it one
[1:01:32] day I think that we can see it in our
[1:01:34] church I believe we're well on our way
[1:01:37] we have a wonderful group of people here
[1:01:40] that that um I've seen I've seen it with
[1:01:43] my own eyes and I've been so impressed
[1:01:46] that we feel so strongly about
[1:01:49] something and then we see the Holy
[1:01:52] Spirit maybe start to move and we are
[1:01:55] able to get our own way of thinking out
[1:01:58] out and make a decision to follow the
[1:02:01] lord and it may be something that we
[1:02:04] never
[1:02:05] thought happened me with me the other
[1:02:07] day with
[1:02:09] um um remember voting on the bylaws I
[1:02:13] was steadfast we're going to do it and
[1:02:16] uh some people said you know we should
[1:02:18] wait and not vote on the bylaws and I
[1:02:20] was like No we're going to do it and
[1:02:22] then finally I was able to surrender and
[1:02:24] I said Lord I'm sorry what do you
[1:02:27] want and I believe he said I don't want
[1:02:29] you to do it right now and then we were
[1:02:33] able to to put it off we're still going
[1:02:35] to do it but um God's time brother
[1:02:38] Jeremy would you come and close
