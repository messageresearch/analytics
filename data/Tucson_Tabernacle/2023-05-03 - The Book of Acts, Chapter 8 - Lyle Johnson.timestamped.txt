[26:10] um
[26:10] I was looking at this brother right here
[26:13] in the front brother I forgot your name
[26:15] right brother Raphael I was talking with
[26:18] brother Rafael on Sunday
[26:20] and it was after service and brother
[26:23] Raphael
[26:25] told me he says he says I missed most of
[26:27] service
[26:28] he said because
[26:31] um you had trouble with the bus am I
[26:32] right
[26:33] I missed the bus and I and I walked
[26:37] down Romero and on Miracle Mile
[26:41] then came
[26:45] then they went then went on Blackledge
[26:49] and then went to first and then went
[26:51] down first
[26:53] to Glenn and then it went West on Glenn
[26:57] to
[27:01] Geronimo and then went down Geronimo to
[27:10] toe and then over here
[27:15] yeah let me tell you
[27:18] God bless your heart my brother
[27:21] foreign
[27:21] [Applause]
[27:26] touched me
[27:27] my brother telling me that on Sunday
[27:30] that he went to such an effort to get
[27:33] here
[27:34] because it's important to him brother
[27:36] Raphael God bless your heart I was in
[27:38] Peru
[27:40] a number of years ago
[27:42] and we have meetings there
[27:45] and we're
[27:47] over um I forgot I think we're in a
[27:49] church or I forgot exactly where we were
[27:54] but uh this man showed up in very very
[27:59] short
[28:00] man real real dark complected
[28:03] and um
[28:05] he came in he greeted agreed the
[28:07] Brethren and he
[28:10] um we shook his hand and he went and he
[28:12] sat down
[28:13] just quiet and just watching us so
[28:16] intently
[28:18] and um
[28:20] it's such a nice spirit and I noticed of
[28:23] course they speak Spanish in Peru I
[28:25] noticed that the brothers the
[28:26] translators were having trouble
[28:28] understanding him and it's because
[28:30] Spanish wasn't his native language he
[28:32] spoke in Indian dialect
[28:35] and as he was talking
[28:39] um
[28:40] with some of the brothers he wouldn't
[28:41] say anything while we were there he just
[28:43] wanted to listen to what we had to say
[28:45] and then he he would he would have the
[28:47] translator tell him
[28:50] and uh after a while I found out that he
[28:54] was a Shepherd that lived way up in the
[28:57] mountains of Peru up in the Andes
[28:59] Mountains
[29:00] and he had heard that we were going to
[29:03] be in town
[29:05] in Lima
[29:07] and he started his journey
[29:10] from way up there to his his little
[29:13] place and he lived in just a little Hut
[29:15] way up in the mountains and he started
[29:18] his journey and he walked all day to a
[29:22] road where he could catch a bus
[29:25] and he caught the bus and he traveled I
[29:28] think it was 24 hours on the bus
[29:32] and then he got off the bus and he he
[29:35] walked across Lima to meet us he was a
[29:38] three-day Journey
[29:40] just because he wanted to meet us and to
[29:45] hear what we have to say
[29:47] let me tell you who is the great man
[29:50] cousin Jonathan who's the great man that
[29:52] would make such an effort
[29:54] to do that and let me tell you that man
[29:57] just like our brother Raphael here he
[29:59] will have his reward
[30:01] so many of us won't even walk across the
[30:03] street
[30:04] to go to church or to to greet someone
[30:08] but to hear little things like like you
[30:10] did and it was hot on Sunday and and
[30:13] what you went through I know it wasn't
[30:15] what that that little Peruvian brother
[30:18] did but brother it was a great effort
[30:21] and I think about how many of us would
[30:23] make that effort so I mean God bless
[30:25] your heart my friend I pray that the
[30:27] Lord will return everything that you've
[30:30] given that he'll return it to you a
[30:32] hundredfold and I know that you'll
[30:34] receive whatever you have on your heart
[30:36] whatever you're asking for because you
[30:38] made the effort
[30:40] that kind of stuff blesses me to see
[30:44] Brethren like this and and the spirit is
[30:46] any different I've been to Africa and
[30:50] wherever I wherever we were in Africa
[30:52] we'd have these meetings and and we'd
[30:54] see people coming in that were on one
[30:56] day journey two day Journey three day
[30:59] brother Jonathan those big flatbed
[31:01] trucks that they travel on probably put
[31:03] 30 or 40 of them in the back of that
[31:05] truck traveling from way out in the bush
[31:08] in Africa just to to just get a little
[31:12] bit of the Lord
[31:13] to just hear a testimony to just to just
[31:17] get something that strengths and
[31:19] strengthens them and I just I'm I'm just
[31:22] grateful beyond measure that there's
[31:24] still people like that in the world and
[31:26] I want to be like that I want to be one
[31:28] of those people like our our brother
[31:30] here like that brother in Peru like
[31:32] these African brothers and sisters that
[31:34] would make such an effort
[31:36] and I'm just grateful I'm grateful that
[31:39] there is something that's worth our
[31:41] efforts
[31:42] right here
[31:45] um
[31:46] we
[31:48] we don't have any written prayer
[31:50] requests there brother Aaron told me
[31:52] about brother Justin Brown he um
[31:57] did the videos for harmony here and
[32:00] brother Aaron said he's even spoken at
[32:01] this church before he but Aaron told me
[32:04] his dad passed away recently so if we
[32:07] could remember him so let's stand
[32:14] friends God is still God
[32:17] we have about 50 people in service
[32:19] tonight and he's the god of the small
[32:22] Gatherings just like he's the god of the
[32:25] big gatherings
[32:26] he honors his word
[32:29] and as we go through this book of Acts
[32:32] maybe Place yourself as one of these
[32:35] characters we're going to hear about a
[32:37] lot of different people
[32:39] tonight as brother Lyle reads this
[32:41] chapter to us and expounds on it put
[32:43] yourself in the position of one of these
[32:45] brothers or sisters that you hear about
[32:48] and know that
[32:50] that
[32:51] he's the same God today as he was 2000
[32:54] years ago
[32:55] so let's bow our heads
[32:59] and if you have requests upon your heart
[33:03] the same Lord Jesus
[33:06] that answered in the book of Acts is the
[33:08] same Lord Jesus that is on the throne
[33:10] today
[33:12] and he'll answer
[33:13] [Music]
[33:15] raise your hand if you have a request
[33:20] Lord God Almighty
[33:23] as you look down upon this congregation
[33:26] and you've seen the hands raised
[33:30] Lord we can just
[33:32] sing out how great you are
[33:35] how much we love you Lord and how much
[33:38] Lord we rely on you every single day
[33:43] knowing that these hands that were
[33:46] raised that they had to make an effort
[33:49] Lord
[33:51] however small that effort might seem it
[33:54] was still an effort Lord to have this
[33:56] request answered and we pray that every
[33:59] hand that was raised that you would
[34:01] answer those requests
[34:04] and Lord we want to tell you
[34:06] tonight
[34:07] that we love you we thank you for all
[34:11] that you've done for us
[34:13] we pray father for brother Lyle as he
[34:16] comes to take the pulpit Lord we pray
[34:18] that your anointing would be on him and
[34:20] father as he expounds on this this
[34:23] all-important chapter in the book of
[34:24] Acts father that we would understand
[34:27] what was going on at that time and that
[34:30] we would be able to apply it into our
[34:32] lives
[34:32] [Music]
[34:34] father we're just grateful we're
[34:36] grateful that we have a bible to read
[34:39] knowing that the people in this book of
[34:41] Acts very few of them
[34:43] probably none of them had a Bible
[34:46] they just had a few Scrolls that maybe
[34:48] they could get a hold of to read and go
[34:50] to the synagogue and have one of the
[34:52] brothers read to them and how much they
[34:53] appreciated it father we're grateful
[34:56] that you've given us so much in this day
[34:58] we don't want to take it for granted
[35:01] we thank you Lord
[35:02] we love you
[35:04] we pray that you would be with us
[35:06] tonight

[38:33] the well from my notes brother Aaron was
[38:37] singing fill my cup Lord and it was the

[39:58] hear from you that's our desire we thank
[40:01] you in Jesus precious name
[40:03] amen
[40:05] amen
[40:06] while we're standing
[40:08] I'd like you to turn your Bibles to our
[40:10] introductory verse
[40:13] instead of Acts 8 1
[40:16] let's turn to
[40:19] acts 1 8.
[40:21] in fact let's start at 1-6 to lay a
[40:25] foundation for one of the lessons of
[40:27] chapter eight
[40:28] these are among the very last words
[40:33] that Jesus spoke immediately before his
[40:36] Ascension
[40:37] telling the disciples the purpose of the
[40:40] infilling of the previously promised
[40:42] Holy Spirit acts 1 6 and when they
[40:44] that's the 11 disciples now called
[40:46] Apostles therefore were come together
[40:49] they asked of Jesus saying Lord will
[40:53] thou at this time restore again the
[40:55] kingdom to Israel you know take this
[40:58] room
[40:59] and he said to them
[41:02] it's not for you to know the times
[41:06] or the seasons which the father hath put
[41:10] in his own power
[41:13] but he continued ye shall receive power
[41:17] after that the Holy Ghost has come upon
[41:20] you
[41:20] and to what end
[41:23] for what purpose ye shall be Witnesses
[41:26] unto me or Witnesses of me in Jerusalem
[41:30] and in all judeo
[41:32] and in Samaria
[41:35] and unto the uttermost part of the Earth
[41:38] and when he had spoken these things
[41:40] while baby held
[41:42] he was taken up
[41:45] acts 8 will detail for us how the
[41:48] followers of Jesus spread the gospel
[41:50] message exactly as Jesus instructed them
[41:54] in Acts 1 8 please be seated
[42:00] we ask ourselves what might Jesus have
[42:03] meant is this instruction
[42:06] or is it prophecy how does it apply to
[42:10] acts eight the disciples had asked if he
[42:13] would restore the kingdom to Israel at
[42:15] this time to take his throne as ruler of
[42:17] the world
[42:19] and he said that's not for you to know
[42:21] when that's going to happen but
[42:23] he continued you shall receive power and
[42:26] be my Witnesses and then he lists some
[42:29] places
[42:30] where are Jerusalem Judea
[42:34] Samaria What's significant about that
[42:37] what might this mean the uttermost part
[42:40] of the Earth
[42:43] let's take a brief look here I've got a
[42:46] little map of some of the the Roman
[42:48] provinces and uh and what we think of
[42:51] Israel at the time of Jesus
[42:55] Jerusalem I've got to your right a
[42:57] little arrow pointing where where
[42:59] Jerusalem is that's one of the places it
[43:01] was specified here
[43:03] and the districts or provinces of Judea
[43:06] and Samaria
[43:08] and we're also Familiar of course if you
[43:10] go north of Samaria to Galilee which is
[43:13] where Jesus grew up
[43:15] it's where his ministry was based but if
[43:19] we step back just a little bit I show
[43:22] here a map of the Roman Empire at the
[43:24] time of Jesus
[43:25] and at the time of the acts I've
[43:28] indicated Jerusalem again so you can
[43:30] sort of get get an anchor point there
[43:33] the lands there's you can see a dotted
[43:36] line going up and down in the middle of
[43:38] that map the the places that are to your
[43:42] right
[43:43] to the east
[43:44] we're conquered by Alexander in the 320s
[43:47] BC
[43:49] his territory extended beyond the right
[43:52] side of the map as far as the western
[43:53] edge of India modern day Afghanistan and
[43:56] Pakistan and uh and Iraq and Iran and so
[44:00] forth the area to the west of the dotted
[44:02] line including Italy and Spain and
[44:05] France which I've also labeled they
[44:07] weren't conquered by Alexander but by
[44:09] Rome
[44:11] this Mediterranean area this Roman
[44:14] Empire area
[44:15] is most of the world as the people of
[44:19] the Bible were aware
[44:21] when Jesus says the uttermost part of
[44:23] the earth he's not necessarily referring
[44:25] to the planet as we know it in the 21st
[44:28] century
[44:29] but he's referring to the world is just
[44:32] his disciples understood it in their
[44:36] context
[44:37] well with that background for acts 1 8
[44:40] and the acts of the overall setting for
[44:42] the entire book of Acts will do a very
[44:44] brief condensed review of Acts and get
[44:47] rolling
[44:49] and acts 1 Jesus gives the instructions
[44:51] as we just read he ascends the Believers
[44:54] wait in Jerusalem for the baptism of the
[44:56] Holy Spirit to give them power to be
[44:58] Witnesses and during that time they
[45:00] select Matthias to replace Judas to
[45:02] bring their numbers back to 12. in Acts
[45:05] 2
[45:05] we read about
[45:07] The Filling of the Holy Spirit on
[45:10] Pentecost
[45:11] Peter's first sermon the formula we're
[45:14] so familiar with in Acts 2 38 repent be
[45:16] baptized receive the promise of the Holy
[45:19] Spirit three thousand were added to
[45:22] their small number at that time and
[45:24] that's the first mention of having all
[45:26] things in common in Acts 3 Peter and
[45:28] John are headed to the temple they go by
[45:30] the gate called Beautiful there's a
[45:32] beggar that's been there for decades
[45:33] he's miraculously healed everybody wants
[45:36] to find out what's going on and Peter
[45:38] starts with his second sermon now in the
[45:40] temple area but before he can finish
[45:42] that sermon he's arrested
[45:44] put in jail
[45:46] the next morning they reply to the
[45:48] council the council is afraid of the
[45:50] people so they threaten and release them
[45:51] they go and report to the Believers and
[45:55] they all pray for boldness Lord we don't
[45:56] want to be discouraged in the face of
[45:58] these threats
[46:00] and they get the second in filling of
[46:02] the Holy Spirit the whole building
[46:03] shakes and there's a second mention of
[46:06] all things in common which leads into
[46:07] chapter five where we have some people
[46:09] that are trying to impress others and
[46:11] not being honest ananias and Sapphira
[46:14] die lying there's many miracles we're
[46:17] told that happen through the apostles
[46:19] and they're arrested
[46:21] arrested charged and respond the council
[46:24] wants to kill them
[46:25] but a man named Gamaliel intervenes to
[46:29] prevent their execution instead they're
[46:30] flogged beaten really badly again
[46:33] threatened and released
[46:37] at Acts chapter 6 people were starting
[46:40] to complain about well your group is
[46:42] getting more food at the distribution of
[46:45] the daily stuff than our group is and
[46:47] there's a some contention going on
[46:49] so the congregation dominates seven
[46:52] deacons the apostles approve that
[46:54] selection and Stephen one of the seven
[46:56] is witnessing and preaching and debating
[46:59] he's arrested
[47:01] lying Witnesses come and he's tried
[47:03] before that Council in Acts seven we
[47:06] hear about Stephen's defense before the
[47:07] council a masterful sermon
[47:09] well he seized taken outside the city
[47:13] and stoned
[47:15] and it's the first mention of Saul well
[47:18] let's let's pick it up now with the
[47:19] closing verses of chapter seven we'll
[47:22] start at verse 55 just to give us a a a
[47:25] a segue into into chapter eight
[47:28] at the end of his uh sermon
[47:31] Stephen has dropped all pretense of
[47:33] political correctness and he's just gets
[47:35] in their face
[47:37] hearing these accusations these guys
[47:39] become so enraged they start grinding
[47:41] their teeth and it says but but Stephen
[47:43] being full
[47:46] thank God he was full of the Holy Ghost
[47:49] looked up steadfastly into heaven
[47:52] and saw the glory of God
[47:54] and Jesus standing on the right hand of
[47:56] God
[47:57] and he wasn't afraid to tell these very
[48:00] angry people about that he said behold I
[48:03] see the heavens opened and the son of
[48:05] man standing on the right hand of God
[48:08] at this
[48:10] the the members of the council cried out
[48:13] with a loud voice they wanted to drown
[48:15] him out they didn't want to hear anymore
[48:16] they stopped their ears so they wouldn't
[48:18] hear this blasphemy and they ran upon
[48:21] Stephen with one Accord even Pharisees
[48:24] and Sadducees can agree on some things
[48:27] and they cast even out of the city
[48:30] stoned him that means they picked up big
[48:32] rocks
[48:33] and bashed him
[48:35] until his bones were broken and
[48:37] life was Christ
[48:40] and the witnesses remember these are the
[48:43] false Witnesses the lying Witnesses they
[48:46] laid down their clothes at a young man's
[48:49] feet whose name was Saul
[48:51] this is just part of their their process
[48:54] of doing this so Saul is playing a role
[48:57] in this it's a formal role it's it's a
[49:01] role and and this tells us that not only
[49:05] you Saul a young man
[49:07] she's well connected
[49:09] he's serving the council in this portion
[49:12] of this execution
[49:14] well we'll see much more of him in later
[49:17] chapters
[49:18] and as they stoned Stephen he was
[49:21] calling upon God and saying Lord Jesus
[49:24] receive my spirit
[49:26] and he kneeled down as the rocks and
[49:28] stones began striking him and cried with
[49:31] a loud voice more lay not this into
[49:34] their charge and when he had said this
[49:38] Stephen fell asleep he collapsed he's
[49:41] badly injured he's no longer kneeling
[49:44] and the Lord Jesus received his spirit
[49:48] acts 8 verse 1.
[49:51] Saul was consenting unto his desk again
[49:54] Saul was playing a formal role in this
[49:56] martyrdom of Stephen but Luke is careful
[49:59] here to point out he didn't say Saul
[50:02] disagreed Luke is pointing out his
[50:04] attitude yes this is the right way to
[50:07] stamp out this heresy kill the Heretics
[50:11] and at that time
[50:13] that is just after the stoning of
[50:15] Stephen there was a great persecution
[50:17] against the church which was at
[50:18] Jerusalem
[50:19] it's not small
[50:21] it's not minor it's a great persecution
[50:23] but look at it from the perspective
[50:27] of Acts 1 8 that we just read the final
[50:30] words of Jesus before he ascended keep
[50:32] that in mind
[50:34] and they the Believers in Jesus of
[50:37] Nazareth a little footnote when we lived
[50:40] in Israel the Hebrew word for Christian
[50:43] is for Christians is notes ream which
[50:46] basically means from Nazareth right so
[50:48] even today in Hebrew they call you a
[50:51] Christian they're really calling you a
[50:52] person from Nazareth
[50:54] or that you believe in Jesus of Nazareth
[50:57] they were all scattered abroad through
[50:59] the regions of Judea and Samaria
[51:02] sept the apostles
[51:05] so we're setting the stage for the
[51:07] spreading of the Gospel that we just
[51:09] read you shall be Witnesses unto me and
[51:11] all Judea and Samaria
[51:13] so here we see the next stage of
[51:15] spreading the gospel is now set
[51:18] note Luke tells us that the apostles the
[51:21] twelve if you will were not among those
[51:23] that left Jerusalem under the
[51:25] persecution
[51:27] we'll see an aspect of the importance of
[51:29] this when we get to verse 5. I can't
[51:31] help but think there was another time
[51:33] when God commanded people this was after
[51:35] the flood to spread out fill the Earth
[51:38] take their place
[51:40] they wouldn't do it
[51:42] Genesis 11 4 tells us specifically they
[51:45] were resisting doing it
[51:47] Genesis 11 8 tells of the linguistic
[51:51] confusion that God sent them at Babel to
[51:53] force their compliance
[51:56] here we see that Jesus at his Ascension
[51:58] told the apostles to scatter after they
[52:01] carried in Jerusalem and received the
[52:03] baptism of the Holy Spirit
[52:05] to be Witnesses but we're just right
[52:09] here they remained in Jerusalem even
[52:11] with the persecution
[52:13] so persecution came
[52:15] forcing a scattering
[52:18] we read here and devout men carried
[52:20] Stephen while They Carried Stephen's
[52:22] body Jesus had received his spirit
[52:25] so They Carried Stephen's body to his
[52:27] burial and made great lamentation
[52:31] over him he was such a powerful witness
[52:34] that they had lost
[52:36] but it was fulfilling part of what we
[52:38] just read in Acts 1 8 you'll be
[52:40] Witnesses unto me in Jerusalem
[52:44] well if you were keeping a scorecard for
[52:47] acts 1 8 it might look something like
[52:49] this
[52:52] you might ask yourself well that's kind
[52:53] of strange brother Lyle well I'd say
[52:55] yeah why keep a scorecard
[52:59] the Believers expected Jesus return at
[53:03] any moment
[53:04] any day
[53:06] when they when they were asking him
[53:09] about when he was coming to restore the
[53:11] kingdom his reply is that they wouldn't
[53:12] know but they were given a job to do
[53:14] witness and preach Jesus in Jerusalem
[53:17] Judea Samaria and the uttermost part of
[53:20] the Earth
[53:21] now some 20 years later Paul wrote In
[53:23] First Corinthians 15 to the Corinthian
[53:25] Believers as some people were dying they
[53:28] were getting older
[53:29] getting older and and they were very
[53:33] disturbed about this that they would
[53:35] miss the second coming of the Lord that
[53:36] they'd miss out on eternal life so Paul
[53:38] wrote the words in First Corinthians 15
[53:40] that we read at almost every funeral
[53:42] to give them comfort and encouragement
[53:46] I remember back in the 1960s and 70s
[53:50] many of us were counting down the years
[53:54] to 1977.
[53:57] would say well now now here's the
[53:59] revelation of Christ's return the
[54:01] prophet said after a disclaimer that
[54:04] Jesus had returned by 1977. it's on tape
[54:07] more than once so it's got to be true
[54:11] I along with many others skipped college
[54:14] or university expecting the second
[54:16] coming between mid-1973 and the end of
[54:20] 1977. some of you were alive at that
[54:23] time many of you weren't but I can
[54:25] identify with these guys that just heard
[54:28] in Acts 1 8 about about I'm their
[54:32] question their question was when are you
[54:36] coming back and he said well that's not
[54:38] for you to know but and he gave them
[54:41] these instructions I can I can virtually
[54:43] guarantee that there were people that
[54:45] were keeping a scorecard when the gospel
[54:47] was spread in Jerusalem Judea Samaria
[54:49] and the outermost part of the earth
[54:50] Jesus is coming
[54:52] you can take it to the bank that's what
[54:55] he said in response to our question I
[54:57] was there I heard him before he ascended
[55:00] but Jesus instructs
[55:03] instruction in Jerusalem
[55:04] and neither will we let's go to verse 3.
[55:07] as for Saul
[55:09] the well-connected young man before whom
[55:12] the false Witnesses laid their garments
[55:14] at the execution of Stephen Saul made
[55:17] havoc
[55:18] of the church what does havoc mean this
[55:20] is a strange word it means shamefully
[55:23] treated with cruelty and violence he
[55:27] made havoc in that church at Jerusalem
[55:29] entering into every house
[55:31] open up
[55:32] open up going from door to door
[55:35] and hailing that means dragging out men
[55:39] and women and committed them to prison
[55:42] prisons were not nice places
[55:45] setting up things for a Pastor Daniel
[55:47] for Acts chapter 9.
[55:51] therefore they that were scattered
[55:53] abroad that is those that fled from the
[55:55] persecution in the city of Jerusalem
[55:58] they went everywhere throughout the
[56:00] provinces of Judea and Samaria remember
[56:02] the map if you leave Jerusalem you're in
[56:04] Judea if you go very far north you're in
[56:07] Samaria
[56:08] and what were they doing as they were
[56:10] scattering they were hiding and cowering
[56:12] preaching the word
[56:14] the gospel the good news of Salvation
[56:17] through faith in Jesus Christ
[56:20] then Philip now this is Philip the
[56:23] Deacon one of the seven
[56:25] not the Philip mentioned in the gospels
[56:27] one of the twelve remember in verse 1
[56:29] Luke specifically told us the apostles
[56:31] did not leave Jerusalem so there's no
[56:34] confusion here this is Philip the Deacon
[56:37] remember when we talked about that I
[56:39] said of these seven men there were two
[56:41] names that were really outstanding the
[56:43] first is Stephen that we just read about
[56:45] and the second this is Philip
[56:48] so this Phillip went down to the city of
[56:52] Samaria
[56:53] more about this in a moment and preached
[56:55] Christ unto them
[56:57] where
[56:59] Samaria
[57:02] oh another check box
[57:06] what that's what we read right be
[57:08] Witnesses in Jerusalem Judea and Samaria
[57:10] well who made the scorecard probably was
[57:13] Matthew he was he was litter he was a
[57:15] numbers guy hey Matthew please check the
[57:17] box Mark Samaria I can't read it but you
[57:19] can
[57:20] oh two down two to go then Jesus can
[57:23] come back how's it going down there in
[57:25] Samaria anyway
[57:31] there we go and the people
[57:35] of the city of Samaria with one Accord
[57:37] in agreement with one another gave heed
[57:40] now gave heed means that they didn't
[57:42] just hear but they listened
[57:45] they listened they paid attention and
[57:48] they followed through unto those things
[57:51] which Philip spoke
[57:53] and here's why they weren't just hearing
[57:56] his words they were also seeing Miracles
[57:58] which he did
[58:00] what sort of Miracles were being wrought
[58:04] by the hand of Philip there in Samaria
[58:07] for unclean spirits crying out with a
[58:10] loud voice
[58:12] came out of many that were possessed
[58:14] with them
[58:15] and many taken with palsies that's like
[58:18] paralysis or like Parkinson's disease
[58:20] and so forth and they that were lame
[58:24] were healed
[58:25] and as a result of all this there was
[58:29] great joy in that City
[58:32] there's so much Bible History associated
[58:34] with the region known as Samaria the
[58:37] people known as Samaritans and the City
[58:40] of Samaria
[58:43] the city of Samaria was built about 875
[58:48] BC there was this guy named Omri he was
[58:52] a king in Israel I think he was about
[58:54] the seventh king of Israel after things
[58:56] got divided he was the father of the
[58:58] infamous Ahab
[59:00] he bought a hill property built a city
[59:02] which she named Samaria hence the city
[59:04] of Samaria
[59:06] and from which Ahab ruled this became
[59:08] the capital of the northern kingdom
[59:10] called Israel in the books of kings and
[59:12] Chronicles
[59:14] it was pillaged and depopulated about
[59:16] 150 years later by the syrians around
[59:19] around what 723 BC
[59:22] the Assyrians removed most of the Jewish
[59:26] population we talk about the 10 lost
[59:28] tribes and they resettled the area with
[59:30] people
[59:32] from other portions of their empire of
[59:34] that time that was a strategy that they
[59:36] employed whatever they conquered
[59:39] well when the temple was rebuilt under
[59:41] Ezra and Nehemiah about 200 years later
[59:43] 525 BC plus minus there was a problem
[59:47] when the returning Jewish population
[59:49] intermarried with the residents of the
[59:51] territory which were a mixture of
[59:53] peoples from the Assyrian resettlement
[59:55] in the end
[59:57] the people of Samaria were a mixture of
[59:59] Jewish and non-jewish ethnicity and
[1:00:01] culture and of course that spilled over
[1:00:04] into religion at the time of Jesus
[1:00:07] we talk about the Pharisees and the
[1:00:09] Sadducees
[1:00:10] sometimes we talk about the essays but
[1:00:13] the Samaritans were also a sizable group
[1:00:17] with their own set of doctrines and
[1:00:19] interpretations of the Torah the the
[1:00:21] Books of Moses which they held as being
[1:00:24] Holy scripture in fact they didn't
[1:00:26] recognize anything but what we call the
[1:00:28] pentateuch the five books of Moses
[1:00:30] well we read uh for example did you ever
[1:00:34] think when Jesus Met 10 lepers
[1:00:37] he told them to show themselves to the
[1:00:39] priests
[1:00:41] he was talking to Samaritans
[1:00:44] so they were being sent not to Jerusalem
[1:00:46] to the Jewish priests but to the
[1:00:49] Samaritan priests
[1:00:51] you can read it in Luke 17 verses 11
[1:00:54] through 19.
[1:00:55] but Jesus told his disciples when he
[1:00:58] sent them out in Paris
[1:01:02] Matthew 10 these 12 Jesus set forth and
[1:01:06] commanded them saying go not
[1:01:09] into the way of the Gentiles and into
[1:01:11] any City this Americans enter ye not
[1:01:17] huh yet
[1:01:19] earlier in his ministry he sent his
[1:01:22] disciples away to buy lunch so he could
[1:01:24] meet with the person we call
[1:01:26] the woman at the well
[1:01:28] and where is that Samaria specifically
[1:01:31] the town of psycho
[1:01:34] in John 4 this is what I was reviewing
[1:01:37] when brother Aaron sang that verse
[1:01:39] earlier this evening the woman saith
[1:01:42] unto him after he told her personal
[1:01:43] things he could not have known
[1:01:46] sir
[1:01:47] I perceive thou art a prophet
[1:01:51] so let me ask you something
[1:01:53] our fathers worshiped in this mountain
[1:01:55] that's Mount gerizim and ye say that in
[1:01:58] Jerusalem is a place where men ought to
[1:02:00] worship
[1:02:01] our Doctrine and interpretation of Moses
[1:02:04] as we
[1:02:05] appear Mount charism not Jerusalem you
[1:02:08] Jews say the opposite
[1:02:10] what do you say about that which of us
[1:02:12] are correct
[1:02:15] Jesus said to her woman
[1:02:18] believe me the hour comes when ye shall
[1:02:22] neither in this mountain nor yet at
[1:02:24] Jerusalem
[1:02:25] worship the father
[1:02:27] it isn't about mountains angiography or
[1:02:31] temples and altars
[1:02:33] to obey is better than sacrifice right
[1:02:36] ye Samaritans worship ye know not what
[1:02:39] you worship what you don't comprehend we
[1:02:42] know what we worship salvation is of the
[1:02:45] Jews we're called to be a blessing to
[1:02:48] All Nations
[1:02:49] but the hour comes
[1:02:52] and now is
[1:02:54] when the true the real
[1:02:57] the worshipers that God will accept
[1:03:00] be they Jewish or Samaritan shall
[1:03:03] worship the father in spirit and in
[1:03:07] truth
[1:03:08] for the father seeketh such to worship
[1:03:11] Him
[1:03:12] and let me tell you why God is a spirit
[1:03:16] they that worship Him should
[1:03:20] want to no they must worship him in
[1:03:25] where or how
[1:03:27] spirit
[1:03:28] and in truth the spirit isn't enough
[1:03:32] the truth isn't enough
[1:03:34] both are necessary neither is sufficient
[1:03:38] by itself
[1:03:40] the unnamed woman goes into the town and
[1:03:43] tells of her encounter
[1:03:45] many people come to investigate her
[1:03:47] claim skipping down to verse 39 many of
[1:03:50] the Samaritans of that City believed on
[1:03:53] him for the saying of the woman which
[1:03:56] testified he told me all that ever I did
[1:03:59] but so when the Samaritans were coming
[1:04:02] to Jesus they besought him that he would
[1:04:05] tarry with them
[1:04:06] and he Abode there two days he went from
[1:04:10] sending his disciples to go grab some
[1:04:12] lunch while he talked with this lady he
[1:04:14] stayed there for two days
[1:04:17] I don't think he was sleeping during
[1:04:19] that time
[1:04:21] and many more believed because of his
[1:04:24] own word
[1:04:28] the son of God
[1:04:29] in Samaria and they said to the woman
[1:04:32] now we believe
[1:04:34] not because of I saying or not just
[1:04:37] because of thy saying for we have heard
[1:04:39] him ourselves and know that this is
[1:04:42] indeed the Christ the savior of the
[1:04:45] world
[1:04:47] now after two days he departed fencing
[1:04:49] went into Galilee
[1:04:52] later
[1:04:53] as he was making his final journey to
[1:04:55] Jerusalem he passed through Samaria
[1:04:57] likely the same area mentioned in John 4
[1:05:00] this is found in Luke 9. starting at
[1:05:03] verse 51.
[1:05:05] it came to pass
[1:05:07] when the time was come that Jesus should
[1:05:09] be received up he steadfastly he
[1:05:11] resolutely set his face he was
[1:05:13] determined to go to Jerusalem
[1:05:17] we'll read later in a passion and acts
[1:05:19] where there's another man that's
[1:05:21] determined to go to Jerusalem
[1:05:23] and Jesus sent Messengers some of his
[1:05:25] disciples before his face ahead of him
[1:05:28] and they went and entered into a village
[1:05:30] of the Samaritans to make ready for him
[1:05:32] for Jesus that's very likely this could
[1:05:34] be the same Village or one nearby
[1:05:36] there's not that many roads that go
[1:05:38] between Galilee and Jerusalem
[1:05:41] given the Revival of just a few years
[1:05:44] earlier when they declared that he's the
[1:05:46] Christ the savior of the world they
[1:05:48] expected no issue in finding a place to
[1:05:50] stay for the night these people had
[1:05:52] asked them to stay for two days before
[1:05:54] however
[1:05:56] the Samaritans when they the Samaritans
[1:05:59] of the village did not receive Jesus
[1:06:03] why because his face was as though he
[1:06:07] would go to Jerusalem he was determined
[1:06:09] to go to Jerusalem
[1:06:11] not good according to their doctrine of
[1:06:13] holy places
[1:06:15] thanks for the Miracles thanks for the
[1:06:17] healing Jesus yeah you're the anointed
[1:06:20] one but you know you're human and humans
[1:06:21] make mistakes and going to Jerusalem is
[1:06:23] a mistake and we're just going to have
[1:06:24] no part of that that just doesn't line
[1:06:27] up with the way we see things
[1:06:29] Jerusalem really
[1:06:33] when his disciples James and John John
[1:06:37] keeps coming up here and acts right when
[1:06:39] James and John saw this rejection they
[1:06:42] said Lord
[1:06:43] will thou that we command fire to come
[1:06:46] down from heaven
[1:06:49] Elias did
[1:06:51] these guys these ungrateful submares
[1:06:57] but Jesus turned and rebuked them
[1:07:02] sculpted them and said ye know not what
[1:07:05] manner of spirit ye are of for the son
[1:07:08] of man is not come to destroy men's
[1:07:13] lives
[1:07:14] but to save them context Jesus is
[1:07:17] heading to Jerusalem knowing what lies
[1:07:19] ahead for this very purpose
[1:07:22] draw your circle of Fellowship larger
[1:07:25] don't get all exclusive and smug
[1:07:29] and they they all went to another
[1:07:32] Village presumably in other Samaritan
[1:07:34] Village
[1:07:36] remember
[1:07:37] the woman at the well debated with him
[1:07:40] briefly saying our father's Worship in
[1:07:42] this mountain not Jerusalem the
[1:07:44] Samaritans didn't want to have this
[1:07:46] Jesus around if he's going against their
[1:07:48] Doctrine about Jerusalem
[1:07:50] spirit and truth right well we
[1:07:53] Samaritans have the truth about where to
[1:07:55] worship and it sure isn't Jerusalem
[1:07:57] regardless
[1:08:00] Samaria had received witness directly
[1:08:03] from Jesus many believed Miracles had
[1:08:08] happened the ground in fact was already
[1:08:11] prepared for Philip
[1:08:13] Jesus said in the same section of John
[1:08:15] chapter 4 that one sows another reaps
[1:08:19] but both are blessed
[1:08:22] so we return now to Acts
[1:08:25] chapter 8 verse 9 will We join Philip
[1:08:28] among the Samaritans
[1:08:31] we read there was a certain man
[1:08:34] called Simon which Before Time in the
[1:08:37] same city used sorcery
[1:08:40] Bewitched the people of Samaria giving
[1:08:43] out that himself with some great one
[1:08:46] sorcery sorcerer this is the Greek the
[1:08:49] word for this is Magi magician it's the
[1:08:52] very same word
[1:08:54] he used to described the three that we
[1:08:57] call the wise men that came to Jesus
[1:08:59] when he was very young and brought gold
[1:09:01] and frankincense and Moon
[1:09:03] Sorcerers magicians it's exactly the
[1:09:06] same word
[1:09:08] to whom they the people of the city all
[1:09:12] gave heed from the least to the greatest
[1:09:15] saying this man is the great power of
[1:09:18] God
[1:09:19] we certainly did have him Bewitched he
[1:09:21] was quite influential he's regarded as
[1:09:24] being so spiritual guy
[1:09:27] and to him to this Simon they had regard
[1:09:30] because out of long time he had
[1:09:34] Bewitched them with sorceries we don't
[1:09:37] have any details about how this
[1:09:39] influence and deception was cultivated
[1:09:41] just that it was
[1:09:43] but one day the people of the city
[1:09:45] believed Philip preaching the things
[1:09:48] concerning the kingdom of God
[1:09:50] and the name of Jesus Christ they were
[1:09:55] baptized both men and women
[1:09:58] no longer following Simon
[1:10:04] then Simon himself believed also
[1:10:08] and when he was baptized he continued
[1:10:12] with Philip
[1:10:13] and wondered
[1:10:15] beholding the Miracles and signs which
[1:10:19] were done
[1:10:20] how do you do that Philip
[1:10:24] my incantations don't work quite that
[1:10:27] well
[1:10:29] there's no indication that Simon didn't
[1:10:31] believe
[1:10:32] he said he believed
[1:10:35] but
[1:10:36] we remember the words written in James 2
[1:10:39] 19.
[1:10:40] thou believest that there is one God
[1:10:43] thou doest well the Devils also believe
[1:10:45] and tremble
[1:10:48] however
[1:10:50] we see that Philip or someone he
[1:10:52] designated baptized Simon it only seems
[1:10:55] reasonable that he repented of his sins
[1:10:58] they knew you don't just baptize a
[1:11:00] person before they repent right
[1:11:02] so at least Simon must have claimed to
[1:11:04] have done so
[1:11:06] he was baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:11:08] Jesus
[1:11:09] now
[1:11:10] when the apostles which were still at
[1:11:13] Jerusalem
[1:11:15] a reminder that they hadn't left
[1:11:17] heard that Samaria had received the word
[1:11:20] of God
[1:11:21] the gospel
[1:11:23] they sent unto them
[1:11:24] they sent to the Samaritans two of their
[1:11:27] number namely Peter and
[1:11:28] John fire from heaven John going back to
[1:11:32] Samaria
[1:11:35] I'm sure that he remembered that he
[1:11:37] recalled that as he journeyed
[1:11:42] who when they were come down Peter and
[1:11:44] John to Samaria
[1:11:48] it's interesting you know the little
[1:11:50] sidebar that when we lived in Israel
[1:11:52] when one goes to Jerusalem if we say
[1:11:55] that a lot to go up you always go up to
[1:11:58] Jerusalem when you leave Jerusalem you
[1:12:00] always go down
[1:12:04] lamata that's just how it is there's
[1:12:07] only one person that ever went up from
[1:12:09] Jerusalem and we read about that in Acts
[1:12:12] it was Jesus at the Ascension
[1:12:15] so they came down
[1:12:18] and when they were come to Samaria Peter
[1:12:21] and John prayed for them
[1:12:22] that they might receive the Holy Ghost
[1:12:25] that's interesting for as yet
[1:12:28] he was Fallen upon none of them only
[1:12:30] they were baptized in the name of the
[1:12:32] Lord Jesus
[1:12:35] so they'd repented they were baptized
[1:12:38] they had the promise but they didn't
[1:12:40] have the possession yet
[1:12:43] Philip had the Holy Ghost of course but
[1:12:45] brother Raven tells us Peter had the
[1:12:47] keys
[1:12:49] well then late day Peter and John the
[1:12:51] apostles laid their hands on them the
[1:12:54] Samaritan Believers and this Americans
[1:12:58] received
[1:13:00] the Holy Ghost
[1:13:03] hmm
[1:13:04] Simon's observing all of this
[1:13:08] wow
[1:13:10] and when Simon
[1:13:13] wondering at all of this saw observed
[1:13:16] realized that through the laying on of
[1:13:19] the Apostles hands
[1:13:21] Holy Ghost was given
[1:13:24] he Simon offered them Peter and John
[1:13:27] money
[1:13:28] saying give me also this power that on
[1:13:32] whomsoever I lay hands he may receive
[1:13:34] the Holy Ghost
[1:13:36] the key to understanding this section of
[1:13:39] the narrative
[1:13:40] is motive
[1:13:43] right we're taught to check your motive
[1:13:45] why are you doing this your objective
[1:13:47] what do you hope to achieve
[1:13:49] this guy had a problem with
[1:13:53] it's not just a simple misunderstanding
[1:13:55] Simon wasn't seeking this power to help
[1:13:58] others but to help himself
[1:14:01] to retain or recover or retain his
[1:14:04] influence as the power of God
[1:14:10] said unto Simon
[1:14:12] thy money perish with thee
[1:14:16] that's strong words
[1:14:18] Peter is not a happy camper when he
[1:14:21] hears this from Simon
[1:14:23] by money perish with you because thou
[1:14:25] Hast thought that the gift of God may be
[1:14:27] purchased with money
[1:14:29] Simon this is a gift
[1:14:32] not a product
[1:14:34] this is not some sort of power based on
[1:14:37] an incantation in the name of Jesus I
[1:14:39] command you receive though it no no it's
[1:14:43] it's not sorcery we're not some secret
[1:14:45] capital
[1:14:47] you've got it completely wrong Simon
[1:14:50] you're coming from a bad place and not
[1:14:52] going to a good one
[1:14:54] thou Hast neither partner lot in this
[1:14:56] matter you have no part in this ministry
[1:14:59] and here's why
[1:15:01] why for thy heart is not right and the
[1:15:04] sight of
[1:15:06] sight of so Simon here's what you need
[1:15:08] to do
[1:15:09] repent
[1:15:11] turn around
[1:15:13] change your attitude change of heart
[1:15:18] repent therefore of this thy wickedness
[1:15:21] Own It Simon
[1:15:23] and pray God if perhaps the thought the
[1:15:26] evil intent of your heart may be
[1:15:28] forgiven you
[1:15:30] perhaps
[1:15:32] I say perhaps because I perceive I see I
[1:15:37] recognize I have Insight that reveals
[1:15:40] that thou art in the gall of bitterness
[1:15:43] Simon you're poisoned by bitter jealousy
[1:15:48] of what you see in US
[1:15:50] and you're in the bond of iniquity
[1:15:52] you're held captive Simon by sin
[1:15:58] then
[1:15:59] answered Simon and said pray you to the
[1:16:03] Lord for me that none of these things
[1:16:04] that you have spoken come upon me
[1:16:08] this is a request motivated by fear
[1:16:11] he knows he's seen the power of these
[1:16:14] Apostles but it's not accompanied by
[1:16:17] repentance
[1:16:18] there's no change of heart
[1:16:21] he recognizes Peter has what it takes
[1:16:23] but Simon doesn't respond with you're
[1:16:27] right help me overcome this
[1:16:30] brother I repent
[1:16:33] God forgive me
[1:16:35] no
[1:16:36] I don't want that to happen you've got
[1:16:38] the power to make it not happen
[1:16:39] intervene for me please
[1:16:42] Peter's given Simon Direction Simon's
[1:16:44] not taking the advice
[1:16:46] and it's the last we hear assignment
[1:16:49] now by the way it's not the last Hitler
[1:16:52] Simon there's one more thing I need to
[1:16:53] bring up there's did you know that
[1:16:55] there's a word in the English language
[1:16:56] that's derived from this part of Acts 8.
[1:17:01] when I read the definition to you you'll
[1:17:03] see the irony
[1:17:05] and the Catholic practice in medieval
[1:17:07] times of selling indulgences bishoprics
[1:17:09] and so forth to the office of the Pope
[1:17:12] which they claimed was held by Apostolic
[1:17:14] succession
[1:17:15] from Peter himself and the word is
[1:17:17] simony
[1:17:20] you can look it up in any dictionary you
[1:17:22] want going back hundreds of years it's
[1:17:24] an English word and I'll just read the
[1:17:26] first definition I'm not going to worry
[1:17:27] with all of it the buying or selling of
[1:17:29] ecclesiastical offices or of indulgences
[1:17:32] or other spiritual things
[1:17:36] okay now we will leave Simon we'll get
[1:17:39] back to Acts chapter eight we're not
[1:17:41] leaving acts verse 25 and they Peter and
[1:17:45] John when they had testified and
[1:17:47] preached the word of the Lord to the
[1:17:49] Samaritans in the city return to
[1:17:51] Jerusalem and as they made their way
[1:17:54] they preached the gospel in many
[1:17:57] villages of the Samaritans
[1:18:00] well so far
[1:18:02] in chapter 8 we've had an introduction
[1:18:04] to Saul
[1:18:06] we see the gospel preached in Jerusalem
[1:18:08] and in Samaria
[1:18:12] we're seeing the Holy Spirit as a gift
[1:18:14] from The Sovereign God not a product
[1:18:17] to be bought and sold
[1:18:20] we must always remember
[1:18:22] that we are tools in his toolbox
[1:18:25] I've too often seen it the other way
[1:18:27] around people commanding or demanding
[1:18:30] that God do this or that
[1:18:32] he's Sovereign he is in control we are
[1:18:36] not
[1:18:37] well let's see what else happens in this
[1:18:39] chapter verse 26
[1:18:42] and the angel of the Lord
[1:18:44] spake unto Philip saying arise and go
[1:18:47] toward the South unto the way that goeth
[1:18:49] down from Jerusalem unto Gaza which is
[1:18:51] Desert
[1:18:53] this is a road that passes through a
[1:18:56] part of the parched Sinai Luke's careful
[1:18:58] to record the angel pointed out and this
[1:19:01] journey will go into the desert it's
[1:19:03] important that we understand that
[1:19:05] Philip has been as married to the north
[1:19:08] now he has a long hot Dusty walk south
[1:19:13] days and days like you were talking
[1:19:15] about earlier brother
[1:19:18] and Philip resisted this
[1:19:20] oh no he arose
[1:19:23] and went
[1:19:25] I I sometimes think that maybe this was
[1:19:27] a prompting of the Angel of the Lord
[1:19:29] rather than just a nudging of the holy
[1:19:31] spirit because he was going to be going
[1:19:33] through Jerusalem he was going through a
[1:19:34] dangerous place he'd fled from there and
[1:19:37] now the Lord is saying go down to this
[1:19:39] place on the road from the place you
[1:19:41] just left and by the way it's on the
[1:19:43] other side of that place
[1:19:45] so so here we see Samaria where he's
[1:19:49] coming down to Jerusalem and then taking
[1:19:51] a road across the desert to Gaza gaza's
[1:19:54] in the news even today I think it's uh
[1:19:56] it's not not a good place
[1:19:59] well so Philip's walking and Philip
[1:20:03] couldn't read ahead like we can
[1:20:06] he didn't know what would happen maybe
[1:20:08] martyrdom like his friend Stephen
[1:20:10] he simply obeyed trusting the word of
[1:20:13] the angel
[1:20:15] I think the Lord might have just been
[1:20:16] giving him a little extra assurance that
[1:20:18] things were going to be okay
[1:20:20] well let's continue Phillips now made
[1:20:22] his way down into the southern desert
[1:20:25] and behold
[1:20:28] a man of Ethiopia
[1:20:30] a eunuch of great Authority Under
[1:20:33] Candace
[1:20:35] Queen of the Ethiopians who had the
[1:20:38] charge of all her treasure all the
[1:20:40] nation's wealth he was he was the
[1:20:42] treasure he was kind of the the Janet
[1:20:44] Yellen of his day under that government
[1:20:46] he had come to Jerusalem
[1:20:49] for to worship
[1:20:51] that's a Curious Thing
[1:20:54] we see that this is a man of Jewish
[1:20:57] faith
[1:20:58] why else come to Jerusalem to worship
[1:21:00] from such a great distance this is many
[1:21:02] many hundreds of miles perhaps a
[1:21:04] thousand miles or more it's a long way
[1:21:06] to go
[1:21:07] well perhaps there's a link back to
[1:21:09] Solomon and the Queen of Sheba we don't
[1:21:11] exactly know where Sheba is but some
[1:21:13] place it as being in Ethiopia
[1:21:17] anyway regardless this is a man who has
[1:21:20] come to Jerusalem he believes Judaism
[1:21:23] right he's a high-ranking man
[1:21:26] and we read that he was returning
[1:21:29] to Ethiopia
[1:21:31] and he's sitting in his Chariot as a
[1:21:34] word that's used I think Carriage might
[1:21:35] be a little more appropriate this isn't
[1:21:37] have been her racing vehicle
[1:21:40] one designed for long-distance travel
[1:21:42] and what's he doing as he's wildling
[1:21:45] away the time he's not playing cards
[1:21:48] with somebody else in the carriage with
[1:21:49] him
[1:21:50] he read isaius
[1:21:53] the prophet
[1:21:55] there's a lot of things that are
[1:21:57] indicated here one this is definitely a
[1:21:59] person of great wealth he had possession
[1:22:01] of a scroll
[1:22:03] these are horribly expensive things
[1:22:06] and they didn't have Bibles you had a
[1:22:09] scroll of Genesis an a school of Exodus
[1:22:12] and a school and so forth if you've got
[1:22:14] you know 40 odd books in the in the Old
[1:22:18] Testament in the Jewish Bible the Tanakh
[1:22:20] then you've got that many Scrolls
[1:22:22] they're all very expensive
[1:22:25] but not only did he have that that he
[1:22:28] could say look at me I own a scroll he
[1:22:30] could read it
[1:22:31] so he was an educated man
[1:22:35] and the scroll
[1:22:37] as we'll see was written in Greek
[1:22:40] it was part of the Septuagint
[1:22:43] but we'll see why we know this in a
[1:22:45] couple of more verses but let's see it
[1:22:46] with this word Chariot this is our
[1:22:49] standard stereotype
[1:22:51] okay it's a lightweight racing vehicle
[1:22:54] no place to sit much less read a
[1:22:57] valuable and fragile scroll in the hot
[1:22:59] Judean Desert Sun in the summertime
[1:23:04] here we see a a reconstruction of a
[1:23:07] Roman Carriage that was found near
[1:23:09] Pompeii and they looked at the wrecked
[1:23:12] one that they found in the
[1:23:14] archaeological dig and constructed a
[1:23:16] model of it a full-scale one this is in
[1:23:18] a museum in Cologne Germany
[1:23:21] I doubt if you saw it when you were
[1:23:23] there I don't know if you were in
[1:23:24] Cologne on this trip okay well when you
[1:23:26] go back check out the carriage
[1:23:29] at the smaller illustration is a drawing
[1:23:32] depicting what a traveling Carriage may
[1:23:34] have looked like in the end we don't
[1:23:36] know what's convenience used by the
[1:23:38] Ethiopian might have been but it's more
[1:23:41] likely close to one of these a place to
[1:23:44] sit shade room for the sorts of things
[1:23:46] of very wealthy traveler going over
[1:23:49] great distances might require
[1:23:51] another thing to note is that while
[1:23:54] Roman roads were extensive
[1:23:57] and durable
[1:23:59] they were not smooth
[1:24:01] I I think that some of the folks that
[1:24:03] handled the roads here in Tucson went
[1:24:04] saw Roman roads and and bring that that
[1:24:07] Adventure back to us here in our town
[1:24:10] so travel would be slow
[1:24:13] noisy
[1:24:14] tiring
[1:24:16] not very comfortable
[1:24:18] this would allow Philip to walk
[1:24:20] alongside along with undoubtedly an
[1:24:23] armed retinue that's in the employee of
[1:24:26] Ethiopia that's protecting this guy and
[1:24:28] his stuff
[1:24:31] so the Ethiopian maybe he was reading
[1:24:34] aloud so he could maybe so he could
[1:24:36] better concentrate I remember when when
[1:24:38] I was younger
[1:24:40] yeah they had printed materials that
[1:24:42] when I was younger and I was reading or
[1:24:44] studying something
[1:24:46] sometimes I would read it aloud to help
[1:24:48] drown out noise distractions that were
[1:24:51] around me to help me concentrate
[1:24:53] well let's read on here in verse 29 read
[1:24:56] then the spirit that's not the angel
[1:24:58] this time Phillips already there he's
[1:25:00] gone past the dangerous place
[1:25:03] but it's that still Small Voice it's
[1:25:06] that nudge said unto Philip
[1:25:10] go near
[1:25:12] join yourself to walk alongside this
[1:25:15] Chariot discourage this conveyance
[1:25:18] and Philip
[1:25:20] hesitantly bashfully awkwardly no Philip
[1:25:25] ran feather to him
[1:25:28] Lord you told me to do this I'm going to
[1:25:31] do it with enthusiasm and dedication you
[1:25:34] told me to get next to that guy I'm
[1:25:36] getting next to him so he ran further to
[1:25:38] him and he heard him read
[1:25:41] so he was reading out loud he heard him
[1:25:44] reading out loud the prophet Isaiah and
[1:25:45] Philip recognizing the passage
[1:25:49] said asked understand thou with thou
[1:25:53] readest
[1:25:54] hey Ethiopian rich guy
[1:25:57] do you know what you're reading
[1:26:00] and the man from Ethiopia said
[1:26:03] how can I accept some man should guide
[1:26:07] me
[1:26:08] I need a teacher
[1:26:10] a tutor
[1:26:11] are you one do you know what this means
[1:26:14] so he desired Philip that he would come
[1:26:17] up and sit with him now notice
[1:26:20] this man was spending his time
[1:26:23] seeking to better know the Lord he made
[1:26:25] a long trip to Jerusalem to worship he's
[1:26:27] making a long trip home but he's not
[1:26:30] leaving his religion behind in Jerusalem
[1:26:34] he's studying he's trying to understand
[1:26:36] he's reading the words of a prophet he
[1:26:38] was having trouble understanding it but
[1:26:41] that didn't stop him from reading it
[1:26:43] that didn't stop him from trying that
[1:26:46] didn't stop him for making that effort
[1:26:50] whatever do we make
[1:26:52] whatever does Lyle make
[1:26:56] the place of the scripture which he read
[1:26:59] was this
[1:27:01] he was led as a sheep to the slaughter
[1:27:05] and like a lamb dumb before his shiver
[1:27:08] so opened he not his mouth
[1:27:11] and his humiliation
[1:27:13] his judgment was taken away
[1:27:17] who shall declare his generation for his
[1:27:19] life is taken
[1:27:21] from the Earth
[1:27:24] this is from the Greek Septuagint not
[1:27:27] from the Hebrew masoretic text
[1:27:30] I'd like to just quickly compare this
[1:27:34] quote from acts verse 33
[1:27:36] and we'll compare it with an English
[1:27:37] translation of that same verse an
[1:27:40] English translation from the Greek
[1:27:41] Septuagint and also a King James passage
[1:27:45] of that same verse it's found in Isaiah
[1:27:48] which is translated from the Hebrew
[1:27:51] it'll help you see how we can usually
[1:27:53] determine if the Greek or the Hebrew
[1:27:55] texts are being quoted and then there's
[1:27:58] a purpose for this
[1:28:01] acts 8 33 the King James and his
[1:28:03] humiliation his judgment was taken away
[1:28:05] who shall declare his generation for his
[1:28:07] life is taken from the Earth
[1:28:09] lxx that 70. it's an abbreviation for
[1:28:12] this up too again it says in his
[1:28:15] humiliation his judgment was taken away
[1:28:18] and who shall declare his generation for
[1:28:21] his life is taken away from the earth
[1:28:22] almost exactly the same and we've gone
[1:28:24] through multiple levels of translation
[1:28:26] so it's the same but in the King James
[1:28:30] from the Hebrew it says he was taken
[1:28:32] from prison and from judgment and his
[1:28:35] humiliation as he was taken that's
[1:28:37] expressed very differently and who shall
[1:28:40] declare his generation for he was cut
[1:28:42] out of the land of the living
[1:28:45] so we can see
[1:28:47] that this fellow is reading
[1:28:50] from the Greek
[1:28:52] don't you love how God prepares things
[1:28:55] this guy is a deacon he's a Hellenistic
[1:28:59] Deacon he's a deacon that speaks and
[1:29:01] reads and understands Greek not Hebrew
[1:29:04] remember the the struggle that there was
[1:29:07] a couple of chapters ago between the
[1:29:08] Greeks and the Hebrews so God has
[1:29:10] arranged for this guy to be speaking the
[1:29:13] right language at the right time to be
[1:29:14] at the right place when this guy happens
[1:29:16] to be reading a scripture out of Isaiah
[1:29:18] 53 that
[1:29:20] things don't just happen
[1:29:22] things don't just happen
[1:29:25] and and he didn't get all uptight and
[1:29:27] say well
[1:29:29] here are you from the step two again
[1:29:31] what's the matter with you you got to go
[1:29:33] back to the original Hebrew
[1:29:35] yeah yeah he wasn't arguing about King
[1:29:39] James versus new international no no he
[1:29:43] said that's what you got we'll go with
[1:29:45] it brother let's go on let's read on
[1:29:48] so verse 34 and the eunuch answered
[1:29:50] Philip and said I pray thee please tell
[1:29:54] me of whom speaks the Prophet this of
[1:29:58] himself
[1:29:59] or some other man
[1:30:02] then Philip opened his mouth
[1:30:06] and began at the same scripture
[1:30:09] and preached unto him
[1:30:11] Jesus
[1:30:13] you know in our day we claim to be part
[1:30:16] of those that have their hearts turned
[1:30:17] to the apostolic fathers we talk about
[1:30:20] it in the book of Acts
[1:30:22] note that in all cases of the miraculous
[1:30:25] there's active witnessing going on not
[1:30:28] just live the life that others can
[1:30:30] observe you but risk putting your foot
[1:30:32] in your mouth
[1:30:34] and say something
[1:30:35] and this is all accompanied by the
[1:30:38] joining of civil and ecclesiastical
[1:30:40] authority to persecute those through
[1:30:42] whom such Miracles occur
[1:30:44] we see in America today when you say the
[1:30:46] word Christian or Evangelical Christian
[1:30:48] it's become not a description of a
[1:30:51] person's Faith it's become a political
[1:30:52] label oh
[1:30:54] you're a Christian you're a Maga
[1:30:56] Republican that's that's what you that's
[1:30:58] that's they're synonyms right it's all
[1:31:01] political
[1:31:03] who knows where that might lead anyway
[1:31:05] let's see where this goes
[1:31:08] oh we're back to the scorecard
[1:31:12] preaching to the Ethiopian and the
[1:31:14] territory of Judea
[1:31:16] gives evidence for filling the third
[1:31:18] part of Jesus command or prophecy being
[1:31:21] his witness in Judea Matthew Mark the
[1:31:25] third one
[1:31:27] okay well let's continue reading as they
[1:31:30] went on their way they came unto a
[1:31:32] certain water
[1:31:33] and the eunuch said see look here's
[1:31:37] water
[1:31:38] what does Center be to be baptized
[1:31:42] this is likely summer
[1:31:45] maybe there was a recent Monsoon you
[1:31:48] don't find standing water
[1:31:50] and the Sinai and the Negev in this part
[1:31:53] of the world you do not find pools of
[1:31:55] water just sitting there saying come
[1:31:57] here and be baptized
[1:31:59] this is unusual it gets his attention
[1:32:04] so at and and when did when do they pass
[1:32:07] this scarce body of water
[1:32:10] is it just the right time
[1:32:12] and the waters in just the right place
[1:32:15] after Philip has explained to him the
[1:32:17] right the need the importance of water
[1:32:20] baptism
[1:32:22] that that wasn't anything that they read
[1:32:24] in Isaiah but Philip has been preaching
[1:32:26] with for this guy he's been sharing with
[1:32:27] and they've been on the road for a while
[1:32:28] here
[1:32:30] so Philip responds he says if you
[1:32:32] believe with all your heart
[1:32:34] you can be baptized and and the unique
[1:32:37] answers he says I believe Jesus Christ
[1:32:43] and he the Ethiopian treasurer commanded
[1:32:46] the Chariot to stand still
[1:32:48] and they went down both into the water
[1:32:52] both Philip and the eunuch
[1:32:54] and Philip baptized
[1:32:58] and when they were come up out of the
[1:33:00] water
[1:33:01] the spirit of the lord caught away
[1:33:03] Philip there was there was some Revival
[1:33:05] that was happening here
[1:33:07] at the eunuch saw him no more now we can
[1:33:10] interpret that many ways but but the
[1:33:13] Ethiopian
[1:33:14] went on his way
[1:33:17] rejoicing
[1:33:19] I I think
[1:33:21] probably rejoicing too
[1:33:24] but wait a minute
[1:33:26] there's something else going on here
[1:33:29] let's get back to that scorecard
[1:33:31] given the large and ancient Christian
[1:33:33] presence in Ethiopia even today it would
[1:33:37] seem the eunuch was a faithful witness
[1:33:38] well taught in his brief encounter with
[1:33:41] Philip and no doubt enlightened by the
[1:33:43] Holy Spirit as he continued to read
[1:33:45] Isaiah 53 one of the foundational
[1:33:47] chapters about the Messiah Jesus Christ
[1:33:51] so the gospel is now on its way to the
[1:33:54] uttermost part of the earth as they knew
[1:33:57] it in their day
[1:33:58] the man himself was from that other most
[1:34:00] part so either way whether he's carrying
[1:34:03] it down there or whether the witness
[1:34:05] that he had there in Judea to this man
[1:34:08] acts 1 8 is fulfilled
[1:34:12] Matthew whoa all the boxes are checked
[1:34:16] where's Jesus
[1:34:19] it's 1977. we're ready for the second
[1:34:22] coming
[1:34:23] hmm
[1:34:25] meanwhile
[1:34:27] Philip was found at azotus what's
[1:34:30] another name for ashdod it's not very
[1:34:32] far away
[1:34:33] and passing through Philip preached in
[1:34:36] all the cities till he came to caesarea
[1:34:39] now let's look at the map
[1:34:41] we see a zotus here it's just above Gaza
[1:34:44] the road where they were at and then the
[1:34:47] Bold arrow is showing going up the coast
[1:34:49] there from ashdod he goes to caesarea
[1:34:53] he's going home
[1:34:56] and
[1:34:57] and Philip lives in caesarea which is in
[1:35:00] the northern boundary of Samaria so he's
[1:35:02] going up that entire Coast so some of
[1:35:05] the disciples might have said well well
[1:35:07] but Jesus said all of Judea well yeah
[1:35:10] he's just pretty well covered all of it
[1:35:14] and it's covered a lot of Samaria as
[1:35:16] well
[1:35:18] so
[1:35:20] all these boxes are checked now we're
[1:35:22] going to meet Philip again
[1:35:24] it'll be in Acts 21.
[1:35:28] so you're gonna have to stay tuned for a
[1:35:29] while
[1:35:32] if the musicians would
[1:35:34] please return
[1:35:37] oh yeah it's still well before midnight
[1:35:38] okay
[1:35:40] meanwhile
[1:35:41] what can we take away from chapter eight
[1:35:44] that might help us in our lives today
[1:35:47] first we can expect resistance
[1:35:49] opposition
[1:35:51] not only from Outsiders second
[1:35:54] don't think that if this or that is
[1:35:58] fulfilled or the boxes are checked on
[1:36:00] your particular checklist for Jesus to
[1:36:02] return or that some box that's on your
[1:36:05] list hasn't been checked that Jesus
[1:36:06] can't come back until that box is
[1:36:09] checked on your understanding or
[1:36:11] interpretation
[1:36:12] so many years after the flag is raised
[1:36:15] in Israel a certain number of years
[1:36:17] after some vague reference in Daniel or
[1:36:19] Revelation
[1:36:21] waiting for some sort of pressure to
[1:36:23] force us to get along with each other
[1:36:26] above all our focus should be on our
[1:36:30] relationship with the law
[1:36:32] we've seen that example with Stephen
[1:36:35] we've seen that example with Philip
[1:36:38] doing what he wants us to do Jesus never
[1:36:41] said depart from me your Revelation
[1:36:43] about when I would come was wrong
[1:36:48] he said depart from me
[1:36:50] I never knew you
[1:36:52] it's relationship I'll paraphrase what
[1:36:55] brother Branham said in many places I
[1:36:57] was going to look up several of these
[1:36:59] quotes and put them up and I started to
[1:37:00] but then I thought
[1:37:02] I don't need to read quotes to prove
[1:37:04] what he said
[1:37:06] group of people have the Holy Spirit
[1:37:08] they'll know if what I'm saying is true
[1:37:10] or not
[1:37:11] so I'm going to paraphrase if you know
[1:37:15] that Jesus is coming this afternoon and
[1:37:17] your house has a leaky roof let them
[1:37:20] find you fixing the roof
[1:37:22] if you're a farmer let them find you hoe
[1:37:24] in your spuds or planting your wheat
[1:37:28] look for him every day
[1:37:30] you ready
[1:37:32] don't stop doing what you're doing
[1:37:34] unless it's sin
[1:37:36] keep reaching out to the Lost
[1:37:39] he called it being at your post of Duty
[1:37:42] a way I've expressed it most of my life
[1:37:45] is this live a simple humble Christian
[1:37:48] Life looking for the coming of the Lord
[1:37:51] live your life like he's coming today
[1:37:54] plan your life like you won't come for a
[1:37:57] hundred years
[1:37:58] my brothers and my sisters if our hearts
[1:38:02] are right
[1:38:03] if we're doing what he wants us to do
[1:38:07] he'll sort out all the rest don't be
[1:38:10] distracted by trying to figure things
[1:38:12] out setting dates a list of conditions
[1:38:15] or whatever
[1:38:18] humble Christians
[1:38:21] living a life worthy of the Gospel
[1:38:25] keep your eyes on Jesus
[1:38:28] now I hope you're not getting tired of
[1:38:31] singing It's the life behind the name it
[1:38:34] seems to me it's so applicable to this
[1:38:36] chapter of Acts that I'd like us to sing
[1:38:39] it together and again please
[1:38:42] it's the life behind the name
[1:38:47] that makes the demons tremble it's the
[1:38:53] life behind the name
[1:38:56] that makes the proud part of the Lord it
[1:39:01] was God who devised a plan that in all
[1:39:06] things as a man
[1:39:09] he would win so he could care give us
[1:39:15] the life behind the name let's sing it
[1:39:18] again is our pastor comes to closest
[1:39:20] service it's the life behind my name
[1:39:25] that makes the demons tremble
[1:39:30] it's the life behind the name that makes
[1:39:35] the proud heart humble it was God who
[1:39:40] devised the plan
[1:39:43] added all things as a man
[1:39:47] he would live so he could give give us a
[1:39:53] life behind the name
[1:39:57] did you appreciate that
[1:40:00] [Applause]
[1:40:02] I always get something answered
[1:40:05] I've always liked to study this word
[1:40:07] and when brother Lyle ministers
[1:40:11] I always get something it seems like
[1:40:13] that I thought about my whole life
[1:40:15] that he and
[1:40:17] and not only does he answer it anybody
[1:40:20] can just get up here and say something
[1:40:22] but the lion brings it back to the
[1:40:24] scriptures he says look at this and look
[1:40:26] at this and that is why this and there
[1:40:29] was a number of those things today one
[1:40:31] of those things was who was this man
[1:40:34] Philip
[1:40:36] it always bothered me I I always thought
[1:40:39] that he was one of these seven Deacons
[1:40:42] because it just matches up in the
[1:40:44] scripture but I could never prove it
[1:40:47] and and I thought wow I guess it could
[1:40:49] have been one of the 12 disciples but uh
[1:40:52] brother a while nice job and showing who
[1:40:56] this man was but I also touched on
[1:40:59] something
[1:41:00] and I I want I want to just go a little
[1:41:04] bit deeper in this brother Lyle was
[1:41:07] talking about how this Ethiopian great
[1:41:11] man he had a copy of the Scrolls and he
[1:41:14] was reading the Greek form the
[1:41:17] Septuagint he was reading the Greek form
[1:41:19] of the Hebrew original writings
[1:41:22] and brother Lyle proved that
[1:41:25] I want to tell you I want to show you
[1:41:27] something about the King James Bible
[1:41:29] that maybe you didn't know
[1:41:32] you go over to
[1:41:34] verse 28.
[1:41:37] it says this I can just read it to you
[1:41:39] was returning and sitting in his Chariot
[1:41:42] read essayists the prophet
[1:41:47] that word essayist
[1:41:50] that's Isaiah
[1:41:52] but that is the Greek form
[1:41:57] of the Hebrew name Isaiah
[1:42:00] you in other places you'll see you'll
[1:42:03] see Elias
[1:42:06] for like in the in the New Testament or
[1:42:08] in the Gospels it says well we thought
[1:42:09] Elias was to come first that word Elias
[1:42:12] is the Greek form
[1:42:15] of the Hebrew name Elijah
[1:42:18] the King James Bible
[1:42:20] it preserves that
[1:42:23] so if you read the King James you can
[1:42:27] see that the original language that this
[1:42:30] book of Acts was written because it says
[1:42:32] isais and not Isaiah is Greek
[1:42:37] and if you go to the book of Hebrews and
[1:42:40] you go from Hebrews on to Jude you'll
[1:42:44] see those names are no longer in the
[1:42:46] Greek but they're Elijah and Isaiah
[1:42:50] they're in the Hebrew
[1:42:52] so those after after Hebrews are the
[1:42:57] original language was either air Aramaic
[1:43:00] or Hebrew it was it was the original
[1:43:02] language of Hebrew so my point in saying
[1:43:06] you can see the target audience
[1:43:08] the target audience in most of the New
[1:43:11] Testament was the Gentiles was the
[1:43:14] common language of Greek and I like when
[1:43:17] brother Lyle he'll he'll he'll tell us
[1:43:20] those little things and it just it helps
[1:43:22] me to understand he didn't talk about
[1:43:24] that part but I just wanted to point
[1:43:25] that out to you in your King James Bible
[1:43:28] that you can see that and you can see
[1:43:30] that oh that original language here
[1:43:32] because it says is
[1:43:34] Greek a little bit of trivia God bless
[1:43:38] let's stand
[1:43:41] one more time
[1:43:42] it's a life behind
[1:43:51] it's a life behind the name that makes
[1:43:59] it was God who devised the plan
[1:44:04] that in all things
[1:44:06] [Applause]
[1:44:07] [Music]
[1:44:15] further Silas if you'd make your way up
[1:44:18] and his brother Silas is making his way
[1:44:19] up to close
[1:44:21] and also brother Lyle had an underlying
[1:44:24] theme in his lesson today and it was it
[1:44:28] was really beautiful how brother Lyle
[1:44:30] said that he had that score card up
[1:44:32] there
[1:44:33] and wow what an important lesson that we
[1:44:39] can see how many times and I just got
[1:44:41] penned out a couple weeks ago by
[1:44:42] somebody who had all the revelation of
[1:44:45] the Book of Daniel and this plus this
[1:44:46] plus this equals this minus that times
[1:44:48] this equals this equals two years from
[1:44:51] now
[1:44:53] or whatever it was
[1:44:55] Brethren the Lord Jesus warned us not to
[1:44:58] do that
[1:45:00] he said he says his brother Lyle said
[1:45:02] he'd be he said be ready all the time I
[1:45:04] remember when I was a kid
[1:45:07] thinking well when I see California sink
[1:45:09] and I see all these earthquakes happen
[1:45:11] then I'll stop being a sinner
[1:45:15] and that's just not
[1:45:17] it's not the way to do it
[1:45:19] and I've heard other people say that
[1:45:20] well when I see the dead in Christ rise
[1:45:23] when I see my mom or or my dad or my
[1:45:25] husband or my wife or whoever it might
[1:45:27] be when I see that person come to me
[1:45:29] then I'll know it's time and then I'll
[1:45:31] get ready no you won't you won't see
[1:45:33] them if you're not ready
[1:45:35] you get ready before that Resurrection
[1:45:37] you get ready before that scorecard is
[1:45:40] filled out all the way and then you'll
[1:45:42] see it amen God bless you brothers and
[1:45:45] sister brother you should come
[1:45:48] for the Silas
