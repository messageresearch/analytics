I'll be putting the words up as we sing yeah that's good right there this this song that's for you this song came to my mind when brother Daniel was speaking to us on Sunday morning about uh about the three young men in Babylon that went into the fiery furnace rather than worship and Idol and the first verse talks about that the second verse talks a bit about the people that are in the first part of the book of Acts about Peter and James and John uh James being one of the the first Mars of the church and and Peter and John uh being very involved in the in the early days of the church there the third verse I think identifies a lot with Paul the Paul of Acts chapter 21 which we're going to conclude tonight and in the chorus we can see the reason for the persecution of the church so you you pray for us as we as we try to do this three Hebrew children in Babylon back in the long ago they would not worship Idol to the furnace they would go but when the king did look inside he saw the Fourth Man to it was Jesus my Lord and my God he is the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end he's the Great I am the Prince of Peace God's fullness dwells in him he wonderful the counselor the Mighty God is he he is Jesus my Lord and my God Peter James and John were led to a high mountain apart Moses and Elijah God's glory did impart but when they lifted up their eyes the prophets both were gone they saw Jesus my Lord and my God he is the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end he's The Great I Am The Prince of Peace God's fullness dwells in him he wonderful the counselor the Mighty God is he he is Jesus my Lord and my God my way had grown so weary My Body all bent and tired I tried to walk as Jesus walked though often I was tried but one day there will be no pain all sorrow will pass away when I see Jesus my Lord and my God he is the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end he's The Great I Am The Prince of Peace God's fullness dwells in him he wonderful the counselor the Mighty God is he he is Jesus my Lord and my God he is Jesus my Lord and my God [Applause] I got to get back to my script good evening that that's where we start tonight we continue our study the book of Acts this time finishing chapter 21 it covers the events that transpire over Paul's first week or so after having arrived in Jerusalem with the expectation that there would be trouble the Jewish people would put him in the hands of the Gentile authorities before we open our Bibles let's pray together to the author Lord Jesus we're gathered tonight together as a portion of the body of Christ purchased by your blood on Calvary filled with your spirit Lord Lord we desire to hear from you we'll be reading from your word Lord and we pray Lord that these thoughts that are expressed tonight Lord that you'd guard my lips Lord and that you'd guard the ears of the hearers Lord that no one stumble or be misled Lord that I don't misspeak or say something that would be displeasing but Lord that it would just draw us all closer together and help us to realize more and more your grace in our lives Lord and the and the wonderful wonderful thing that you did in the book of Acts to give us a pattern a template a way to know how we're to act in our day we thank you for this this opportunity to be together and we commit the remainder of this service into your hands in Jesus precious name amen you may notice I I closed my eye a little bit yesterday I had cataract surgery and today the uh the I went to the opthalmologist and he put all those drops on my eyes that make my pupils get real big and so it's uh that's a little disconcerting so if I wind up doing this you know that I'm not winking at somebody I'm just uh trying to deal with the the brightness and the glare so if if if we could stand because we're going to read from the word for our topic verse we'll read from acts but we're going to read from chapter 26 where Paul's giving a testimony at his own trial he says I verily thought with myself I I I was convinced that I ought to do many things contrary to in the name of Jesus of Nazareth do do as much as I could to oppose this heretical sect which thing I also did w that's just what I did in Jerusalem and many of the Saints people I now recognize as fellow Believers did I shut up in prison having received Authority from the chief priests and they were put to death I gave my votes my vote I I cast my vote against them cons en senting to Steven's death sentent in Acts 7 meant more than just agreeing he voted for Steven to be put to death standing over the coats of them that stone Steven was not an isolated act Paul was busy imprisoning and assisting in the deaths of many of the early Believers in Christ and I punished them of frequently I was zealous in every synagogue and compelled them to Blas ah what is the blasphemy that they uttered and being exceedingly mad wild with Fury violently opposed against them I persecuted them even unto strange cities foreign cities beyond the borders of the province of Judea please be seated our opening verses from acts record Paul confessing at a trial in this case before King Herod a grippa II some two years after the events of Acts 21 that he's guilty of persecuting the early Believers he admits to testifying against multiple people that were put to death if we were to read slightly further we'd see that he's leading up to recounting his meeting the Lord as he approached the city of Damascus and pursuit of the followers of Jesus now you may be one com to ask brother ly so what is it about these early Believers that so enraged Saul the Pharisee but which he later practiced openly as Paul the Apostle what is the blasphemy is it the same thing that will result in his troubles in Jerusalem in Acts 21 some 25 years after the birth of the Christian faith on that fateful Pentecost of Acts chapter 2 whoa thank you those are great questions thank you for asking keep those questions in mind as you read from acts 21 this evening with the Lord's help we'll find the answers in the pages of our Bibles we'll back up just a bit from where we left off last time as we start reading in Acts 21 Paul and Luke and Company have left the home of Philip the Evangelist one of the original 7D deacons and are coming from cesaria to Jerusalem this is near probably just a few days after Pentecost Pentecost the Feast of Weeks the traditional day when Moses received the law in Mount Si the traditional birthday and anniversary of the death of King David and the date that marked the birth of the Christian Church acts 21:17 and one when we were come to Jerusalem the Brethren received us gladly oh they were happy to see us they welcomed us and the day following Paul went in with us unto James and all the elders were present and when Paul had saluted had greeted them he declared particularly he recounted and some detail what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry and when they heard it Paul's detailed report about the gospel among the Gentiles of galatia Asia Macedonia Greece AA they glorified the Lord up to this point all is well and James and the elders said unto Paul thou seest brother how many thousands of Jews there are which believe we're a large assembly perhaps the largest in the world and we're Jews not Gentiles and they this massive assembly are all zealous of the law we love our rules the law of Moses the laws handed down at SI some 1500 years ago and they this assembly of thousands of Jewish followers of Jesus are informed of Thee they've heard rumors they they saw it on face scroll with with their ey stones or perhaps just through plain old gossip and many are convinced as a result of listening to these tales that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake moses' law saying they ought not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the Customs last week I mentioned I got upset with James and the elders when I read this verse it was the last verse we read last time oops that's my bad I need to learn from it but not to be judgmental these were sincere Brothers they were doing the best they could following the leading of the Lord in their lives I assume that you accepted your mission from last week and read Romans 4: 1- 12 about circumcision what Paul had to say about it and I'm sure you're aware of another strange association with this charge in fact circumcision was instituted with Abraham not Moses about 600 years before The Exodus in Genesis 17 we read and God said unto Moses that's not how you spell Moses no God said unto Abraham Thou shalt keep my Covenant therefore and thy seed your descendants after thee in their generations for all time this is my Covenant which ye shall keep it's not optional shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee all your descendants every Manch child among you shall be circumcised skipping to verse 14 and just how important is this the uncircumcised Manchild whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that Soul shall be cut off from his people he hath broken my Covenant in the five books of Moses the words circumcise circumcision and circumcised mostly appear in Genesis prior to the giving of the law on Mount Si it occurs two times in Exodus regarding who may eat Passover it occurs once in Leviticus that a male child is to be circumcised on the Eighth Day in Deuteronomy the only mention is in conjunction with circumcising the heart not the Flesh and Moses did not observe or enforce the observance of this commandment nor did Aaron and the rest of the priests for that matter how can you say that brother life how do we know this Joshua chapter 5 this is this is at that time it says this is after they had crossed Jordan the the priest had carried the ark the water stood back the whole throng of people that had been wandering for 40 years in the desert they came across the Jordan the priest came out the waters were closed and at that time after this miraculous thing the Lord said unto Joshua make the sharp knives and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time and that means this second generation skipping down to verse 6 for for the children of Israel walked 40 years in the wilderness till all the people that were Men of War which came out of Egypt were consumed except Joshua and Caleb because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord to take the land and their children whom he the Lord raised up in their stead them Moses no them Joshua circumcised for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them by the away for 40 years they'd ignored that commandment for 40 years it seems to Jewish Christians in Jerusalem but the time of Acts 21 could have used a better example to illustrate the law of Moses in circumcision or at least attributed it to Abraham but I suspect they were more concerned with Customs Traditions familiar and comfortable to them practices keeping those practices living in Jerusalem in the shadow of of the temple would make their lives a lot less stressful with their fellow Jews who are not followers of Jesus you can sort of hear them hey well we're still Jews we do all 613 Commandments and then some we just happen to believe Jesus was the promised Messiah and we'll prove it soon enough because he's going to come back any day now right through that Eastern Gate right there not only that we've heard he said some of his disciples would still be alive at that that time more rumors you watch and see if we're not right oops well last week we talked about customs and traditions and what Jesus said about them in their relative importance a sort of a one verse summary Mark 7 how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments the Customs the traditions of man today we need to be very careful that we don't confuse our customs what I sometimes call message Orthodoxy with Doctrine or scripture piecing together random verses or various quotes from different sermons to justify some opinion or claimed Revelation and to never judge others either on observance or non-observance of such Customs especially on the basis of rumors or posts on social media I know calm down ly breathe in hold it breathe out okay back to Paul in Jerusalem and moving on to the second half of Acts 21 so these are the elders then talking to Paul oh what is it therefore what are we going to do the multitude of Jewish Believers here in Jerusalem must need needs will undoubtedly come together for they'll hear that you're here it's been all over face scroll and and eventual gram do therefore this that we say to thee here's how we want to deal with this problem of the rumor mill Paul we have four men which have a vow on them in fact this is a Nazarite vow it's according to the law numbers 6 veres 1- 21 it's a vow that requires shaving one's head at the conclusion of it which is how we know that it's a azerite vow he's told take them and purify themsel with them and be at charges with them that they may shave their heads that's a Kind of a Funny expression be at charges with them what they're telling Paul is pay the barber pay the charges pay the priest that's going to shave their heads with this ceremony and all of our assembly may know that those rumors that they've been informed concerning the are are nothing but rumors and that thou thyself also walst orderly and keepest the law Paul here at you reminds me of Peter and Paul in the Church of Antioch and Syria when Peter for fear of the Jewish believers who were coming from Jerusalem mm Jerusalem suddenly stopped eating with the Gentiles and Paul called him out in front of everyone in this case the leaders of the church in Jerusalem are asking Paul to do something that it's okay and Paul will do it in sincerity but it still makes me a little angry that they asked him to do this at all not with bad intent just as an expedient way to help quash rumors passing through the congregation what it say Lyall calm down breathe yeah okay did they really think that the people that didn't like Paul the people that were listening to these rumors and believe them would accept Paul doing this one thing and say oh everything we've heard it must be false look Paul's one of really really well you may recall from last week that Paul had written the epistle to the Romans while in Corinth towards the end of his third missionary journey he was expecting to board a ship for Judea and go to Jerusalem but in order to thwart an ambush remember he was carrying a large collection back to Judea to Jerusalem he changed his plans and traveled Overland to Asia instead where he told the Elders of Ephesus in Acts 20 and now behold I go Bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there save that the Holy Ghost Witnesses in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me so with these warnings in mind Paul had written to the Romans knowing that letter would get there before he got to Jerusalem and he'd asked them he said now I beseech you Brethren I beg you I plead with you for the sake of the Lord Jesus Christ for the love of the spirit that you strive together with me fight on my behalf strive struggle fight in your prayers to God for me not just oh Lord bless our brother Paul as he goes to Jerusalem amen no strive struggle fight in your prayers for him and and by this he doesn't mean you've got to get all emotional you if if you don't cry if you don't have tears your prayers just aren't sincere enough he's not talking about that he's saying earnestly regularly remember him in your prayers don't forget him he'll be facing a very difficult time he needs to know that you're standing with him supporting him in your earnest prayers to God on his behalf why that I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judea and that my service which I have for Jerusalem this offering that I'm bringing to the churches may be accepted of the Saints Paul remembers the rejection he had when he first came to Jerusalem Barnabas had to intervene for him and as he was involved in the persecution and death of many in Jerusalem there are many deep-seated hostile feelings toward him Jerusalem's not a comfortable place for Paul to be in any case especially in light of All These Warnings as he makes his way there Paul knows very well that it's the spirit of antichrist is opposing him not the Antichrist we think of in Revelation but but Satan and his angels that Spirit he will later write to the church at ephes Ephesus in Ephesians 612 we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places I was struck by some of the scriptures brother Daniel read Sunday morning from Romans chapter 8 I want to remind you of some of them and expand just a little bit and especially want you to listen to these verses in light of what you know about the context Paul is writing this letter to the Romans from Corinth he's had These Warnings he's preparing to go to Jerusalem where he's consistently told serious persecution awaits him there Romans 8:35 he says who what shall separate us from the love of Christ in other words can anything separate us from Christ's love does it mean he no longer loves us if we experience tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword Paul's experienced all of these things as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter that's Psalms 44:22 says no in all these things in spite of all of this we are more than conquerors more than conquerors overwhelming Victory Is Ours through Jesus Christ that loved us for I'm persuaded I'm convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come the persecution that aits me in Jerusalem nor height the the powers in the heavens above nor depth powers in the Earth Earth beneath or any other created thing shall be able has the power to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord and if we move back a couple of verses one that we're so familiar with Romans 8:28 the context of when he's writing this we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose Paul writes this encouragement to us and light of the dark times that lie ahead for him which he knows he's walking into like Jesus asking his disciples to watch with him in Gethsemane Paul's asking the Romans to pray for him as he heads for the very same Jerusalem back to acts 21 and the elders there speaking to Paul they continue on uh it's touching the Gentiles which believe we have written and concluded that they observe No Such Thing save only that they keep themselves from things offered to Idols from blood from strangled from fornication then Paul agreed to their request he acceded to what they wanted he took the men and the next day purifying himself with them go probably going through a Mikel one of the pools that Herod had constructed outside the temple perhaps he entered into the temple to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification until that an offering should be offered for every one of them and when the seven days of this process were almost ended the Jews which were of Asia this is they're from Ephesus how do we know they recognized Paul Ephesus is the only place that he spent much time in Asia when they saw him when they saw Paul in the temple they were filled with rage against him and they stirred up all the people and laid hands on him not to pray for him not to impart a blessing no remember remember those guys in the synagogue at Ephesus the ones that spoke evil of Paul and hounded him as we studied in Acts 19: 8 and N Paul went into the synagogue at Ephesus spake boldly for the space of three months disput in and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God but when diverse were hardened when some just wouldn't listen they couldn't defend their interpretations but they were unwilling to change unwilling to be convinced that they were wrong and beli not but spake evil of that way that that way being Christianity that Jesus was not just the Messiah but was God in flesh they speak evil of that way before the multitude Paul departed from them remember he went to a school of tyrannis and was there for three years and now here they are in Jerusalem well let's get a bit more context regarding these worshippers of the Lord practitioners of Judaism living in the diaspora the exile outside the land of promise they're just like Paul when he was known as Saul Jesus told his followers in Matthew 10 and Mark 13 in Luke 12 he said take no thought when you're accused when you're seized in the synagogues well that's what Paul said he did often and other places that the Holy Spirit would give them words to speak speak well if that's true if Jesus said that and if they were being seized and the Holy Spirit gave them words to speak then Paul heard the gospel he heard it over and over again as he was persecuting its followers he heard the scriptures he heard the arguments supporting the claim that Jesus was the Messiah and more than the Messiah how did Paul respond acts 8:3 as for Saul the name of Paul prior to his conversion he made Havoc of the church entering into every house and hailing men and women committed them to prison in Acts nine we read and Saul that's Paul yet breathing out threatenings and Slaughter in other words condemnation and death death against the Disciples of the Lord went unto the high priest and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues that if you found any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem for trial execution you'll hear Paul utter these words in the very next chapter of Acts and and when we get to acts 22 and brother Daniel gets to acts 22 next week I presume he's telling the crowd I verily am a man which am a Jew born in Tarsus a city in celissia yet brought up in this city Jerusalem at the feet of Galia and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers and was zealous toward God as ye all are this day and I persecuted this way the followers of Jesus Christ Christians unto the death binding and delivering into prisons both men and women to await trial and execution as also the high priest ha bear me witness and all the estate of the elders from whom also I received letters unto the Brethren he doesn't mean the brethren in The Fellowship of the church he means the Jewish Brethren that were practicing Judaism there and went to Damascus to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem for to be punished to be tried for blasphemy as we read in our in our opening verse in Acts 26 which thing I also did in Jerusalem and many of the Saints did I shut up in prison having received Authority from the chief priests and when they were put to death I gave my voice I cast my vote against them and I punished them of in every synagogue and compelled them to blaspheme and being EX exceedingly mad against them I persecuted them even into strange cities later when he's in prison in Rome Paul writes a letter to Timothy 1 Timothy chapter 1 verse 12 he says and I thank Christ Jesus our lord who hath enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry who was before before I met him on the Damascus Road a blasphemer there's that word again and a persecutor and injurious but I obtained Mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief I'd heard the gospel and rejected it yet I obtained Mercy because this was ignorance remember when Jesus was being crucified he cried father forgive them they don't know what they're doing they're doing it ignorantly in unbelief while we were yet sinners unbelievers Christ died for us in another place he uses the term heresy instead of blasphemy but meaning the same thing in Acts 24 he says I confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy so worship I the god of my fathers believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets what is this blasphemy what is this heresy it's the confession Jesus is Lord capital L capital O capital r capital D Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that Jesus is not just a man he's not just a a Divine being like an angel but that Jesus Christ is the Divine being God himself veiled and living in human flesh and our King James Jes Bibles in the Old Testament you often see the word Lord in all capitals that's when the Hebrew word is one that we sometimes say Yahweh or Jehovah in Judaism it's never pronounced they consider it too holy Jewish people will say adoni which means sir or Hashem which is Hebrew for the name in English they'll write capital G hyphen D they won't even spell the word God that's the reverence that they have in the Greek somewhat less precise or more general term is used curios it's usually translated as Lord but only with the L capitalized if you look at the words and cross reference them if you get a a that the confession Jesus is Lord is really Jesus is Jehovah 1 Corinthians 12:3 wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God calls Jesus a cursed though his body hung on a tree and was thus cursed by God according to moses' writings in Deuteronomy and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord and here I made the substitution and capitalized it but by the Holy Ghost this is what Thomas first confessed after he saw the resurrected Jesus this is what Peter preached in Acts 2:36 and this is the blasphemy that led to the persecution of the followers of Jesus Christ claiming a man was not just anointed not just Christos but curios not even that he was a Divine being but God himself whose body hung on a tree after it had died a condition that God himself said meant a cursed person so these Jews from Ephesus that are laying hands on Paul that are grabbing him right now they're just like Paul was without the benefit of the Damascus Road experience and and and what what are they doing in Jerusalem how come they're not in Ephesus why is there such a crowd there remember it was around the time of Pentecost one of the three feasts the Jewish men were commanded to observe in the place the Lord would choose Deuteronomy 16:16 says three times in a year shall all thy men appear before the Lord thy God in the place which you shall choose which became the temple in Jerusalem the Feast of unleavened bread that's Passover and the week following it and the Feast of Weeks Pentecost the time that we're dealing with right now in this chapter 21 and in the Feast of Tabernacles the in gathering the Harvest which happens in the fall so it's reasonable and predictable that some of the men from that synagogue where Paul preached in Ephesus for three months would be there in Jerusalem so back to acts 21 they grabbed Paul started a riot by crying out men of Israel help this is the man that caused so much trouble in our synagogue at Ephesus that teaches all that everywhere against the Jewish people the people of the Covenant with God and the law of Moses and this place the Holy Temple where God himself has put his name and further brought Greeks also from the court of the Gentiles into the temple and hath thereby not only disrespected but in fact has polluted this holy Place polluted why would they say that well Luke gives us a little parenthetical explanation they had seen before with Paul in the city of Jerusalem tropus an Ephesian a gentile whom they recognize as one of Paul's traveling companions listed in Acts 20 so if they knew that this was a gentile from Ephesus probably these guys are from Ephesus or how would they even know that whom they supposed whom they supposed they didn't know don't confuse me with the facts my mind's made up they didn't see tropus in the temple because he wasn't there but because they had seen him elsewhere in Jerusalem they assumed that Paul had brought him into the temple thus polluting it by bringing a gentile beyond the court of the Gentiles so we read right there that they didn't see tropus in the temple area but because they saw him in Jerusalem he associated with Paul therefore Paul must have brought him there even if they can't see him they are as incensed as Paul once was making a man God and in the temple of the priest that had authorized Paul to seize Christian and bring them to trial and execution right there they were having a hard time in Ephesus they delicate relationship with the pagans there having been upset after Paul's Ministry so these guys cry out and what happens all the city was moved agitated stirred up aroused by these accusations it reminds us of the of the riot of the silver Smiths that took place in Ephesus says a few months prior to this and the people ran together and they took Paul They seized Paul and Drew him out they dragged him out of the temple I have to ask where were the many thousands of Jewish Christians that supposedly were going to be seeing Paul do this and change all their minds where were they where were they and forth with the doors the gates to the temple area were shut and as they the mob incited by the Pilgrims from Ephesus went about to kill him to kill Paul in other words they began beating him and who knows what else Tidings news of this came to the chief captain of the band the senior officer in charge of the Roman Garrison probably in the Fortress of Antonia immediately adjacent to the temple grounds that all Jerusalem was in an uproar a riot was in progress the Roman Garrison was likely prepared for some disturbances given that the city was filled with pilgrims for the Feast of Pentecost and keep in mind the entire Province this this is taking place in 57 ad as near as as we can tell in less than 10 years this whole Province will go up an armed Rebellion against Rome you don't have a civil war like this everything is peaceful and calm and wonderful one day the next day you've got armies in the field this has been building up over time one of Jesus uh disciples was uh Simon the Zealot right one of these guys that was all for armed Rebellion against Rome this had been building up and building up for decades so this whole place is in an uproar so who the officer in charge immediately took soldiers and centurions so he took a large group of soldiers perhaps 200 or more and ran he wasted no time ran down unto them Rome feared the mob quelling riots punishing those who instigated them was a top civil priority to maintain civil order and when they those who were attacking Paul saw the chief Captain and the soldiers they left they stopped their beating of Paul then the chief Captain came near Paul and took him commanded him to be bound with two chains now these wouldn't be little lightweight chains like you have on a kid swing in your backyard these were heavy iron made by Hand stout chains and demanded of the crowd who Paul was what is who is this guy what's he done to cause such an uproar he assumed the crowd had some reason to attack Paul they knew Rome does not tolerate riots this will not be tolerated and yet they were insens enough that they went ahead and did it and besides thisy was an officer in the Roman army it's a big bureaucracy he's probably going to have to file a report he wants to get the information that he can put in the report not necessarily an accurate report but at least based somewhat on what's going on and some cried one thing some another among the multitude it reminds us again of the riot in Ephesus people saw a big crowd running and shouting and carrying on and they thought hey let's find out what's going on right all the traffic slows down when there's an accident by the road yeah so when it became obvious that he could not know the certainty the the the exact events that led to the toml he commanded him Paul to be carried into the castle it may be that Paul couldn't walk for the beating he just sustained they were trying to kill him or perhaps the way to the two changes more than he could deal with in his weakened condition and when Paul Came Upon the stairs leading into the castle The Fortress so it was that he was born of the soldiers he was carried by the soldiers for the violence of the people he couldn't climb the stairs maybe due to the beating maybe it's due to the violent Restless crowd for the multitude of the people follow followed after crying away with him so similar to the crowd 25 years earlier crying crucify him same place same place and as Paul was to be led into the castle he said unto the chief Captain may I may I speak unto you who in great surprise said you speak Greek aren't aren't you that that Egyptian guy that that a while back before these days made a big uproar LED Into the Wilderness about 4,000 men that were murderers aren't you that Egyptian guy he doesn't think Paul's a Roman or even that he's a Jew he thinks he's an Egyptian Rabel Rouser when he writes a letter when we get to acts 23 you'll find that he changed ches his story a little bit but Paul said I am a man which am not an Egyptian but a Jew of Tarsus a cidian celissia hence my presence during this pilgrimage for the Feast of Pentecost I'm a citizen of no means City Paul means Rome but the chief Captain thinks he's bragging about Tarsus and we'll see that also in chapter 23 and I beseech you allow me to speak to the people suffer me to speak to the people I can calm him down there's no there no need for this uproar Paul ceases earlier self of Saul In This Crowd and when he the the chief Captain had given him license gave Paul permission to speak Paul stood on the stairs at the entrance to the Fortress and beckoned with a hand unto the people and when there was made a great silence he spoke unto them in the Hebrew tongue said got that you want me to translate it okay we'll translate it come back next week to hear Brother Daniel tell you what I said to the crowd but but wait don't go away we're not done yet we're not finished what what can we learn and apply to our lives from the events in this second part of Acts 21 the takeaway that jumps out at me when I was studying this is how we judge judge how we evaluate others we've read of at least three examples of people judging others this evening the first is that of the Jewish Christians in Jerusalem according to James and the elders the people heard rumors about Paul and they beli those rumors as a result they accused Paul of teaching Jews and other locations to forsake the practices of Judaism both those prescribed in the law and those based on tradition customary practice the second example we've read about is Paul himself we read how we persecuted the church eagerly seeking out Christians to exterminate them to extract their confession the blasphemy that Jesus is Lord not recognizing that it was in fact the truth and that denial of that truth was was in fact blasphemy as a result he sought the conviction and death of many people a third example is that of the Jews of Ephesus now come to Worship in Jerusalem they've heard his words that they consider to be blasphemy they've had to deal with the aftermath of his ministry not just about Diana and the silver Smiths but the fact that Paul Drew away many Jews in Ephesus to Christian Chris ity sucked them into this heresy this Jesus cult they saw Paul as having caused them great damage on many levels they saw him as their enemy if you ask them they would say well we're judging Paul by the word of God brought To Us by a Vindicated Prophet that's what they tell you my brothers and my sisters we must be so very careful within the ranks of what we refer to as the message we hear many different interpretations observe many different practices some groups will totally exclude or shun those that differ in their understanding or opinion of various doctrines and customs and interpretation some Elevate certain individuals and look down on those who don't all claim to have a Revelation as justification for their attitudes and their behaviors towards others Jesus said we' be known by our fruits not by our knowledge not by our Revelation not by our ability to quote another what should our attitude be to those with whom we disagree or or even those who reject us let me answer by reading you some quotes some quotes from a son of man Ministry from from from an early an early sermon it's it's from The Sermon on the Mount and it's found in the gospel of Matthew these quotes Matthew 5:7 Jesus says blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy you want God's mercy in your life I do how do you get God's Mercy by being merciful not harsh or judgmental he goes on he says uh in verse 38 you've heard that it has been said an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth well of course they heard that it's the law of Moses you'll find it in Exodus 2124 you'll find it in Leviticus 24:20 you'll find it in Deuteronomy 19:21 this is a firm rule a firm practice but I say unto you that you resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek cheek listen I can hear the hiss of the crowd sucking in their breath at this statement whosoever will smite thee on the right cheek turn to him the other also a little sidebar did you ever notice that he specifies the right cheek he didn't just say if someone smacks you on one side of the face give them the other side to and the context is about evil have you ever dug into this to see what's so special what's going on here in the Middle East even today in Muslim countries this would be a huge insult this practice dates back at least to the early centuries ad and appears to be true in jesus' time especially in light of this verse and in the year 2000 I went to Saudi Arabia I was cautioned to never use my left hand when eating accepting a gift or almost anything of course I forgot upon Landing in Riyad sitting in an airport lounge awaiting the arrival of the prince who had invited our group a steward offered me a cup of tea I reached up with my left hand to to to take the cup of tea because I had something else in my right hand and he withdrew the tray and gave me a look I put down what I had in my right hand he came with the tray I took he moved on to the next person he moved on to the next person that that was an oops on my part now if someone's going to smite me on the right cheek brother Aaron here's your chance take your best shot brother which hand are you using my left your left hand to hit my right cheek which Jesus said you're using your left hand thank you brother I'm glad you didn't hit me any harder so so when Jesus is talking about the right cheek he's really talking about the left hand the left hand is it's despicable why someone hit you with the left hand why well one eats with one's right hand but one cleans up after do what my grandmother called the the little job no one else can do for me with his or her left hand and of course there were no convenient rolls of bathroom tissue in ancient times the left hand was unclean it symbolized unclean as a result and of course this would have resulted in the tradition that one must wash one's hands before eating before rubbing grain in the field and partaking of it so Jesus is saying to accept that extreme utterly degrading insult don't fight back don't return the insult forgive turn the other cheek okay that sidebar was free continuing in Matthew's gospel after Jesus said what we call the Lord's Prayer he continued with for if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you anyone here not wanting forgiveness then you have to forgive those that hurt you and he goes on the corollary he says if you don't forgive men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses the door swings both ways forgive you will be forgiven fail to forgive you will not be forgiven it's not just confession it's forgiveness genuine heartfelt often hard to do moving on to another example Matthew 7 seven he says judge not that you be not judged for with what judgment you judge you shall be judged and with what measure you meet the the measure the standard you use it'll be measured to you again measured to you also measured back to you so here Jesus is saying the same thing using different words but the same thought that's four times in three chapters relating an account of one sermon don't judge be merciful don't retaliate forgive the musicians would please return He sums it up nicely in Luke's gospel with four Commandments ad do do don'ts and Ado Luke 6 be ye therefore merciful as your father is merciful while we were yet sinners Christ loved us and died for us that's the level of Mercy we are asked to extend to others judge not and you shall not be judged condemn not and you shall not be condemned forgive and ye shall be forgiven when you think of what we sometimes call the promises of God here's four in just two verses but they're conditional we must do our part before we can expect God to do the part he listed his is a response and in the end really we respond to his Love To Us by doing what he asks us to do Jesus said how can you say you love me if you don't do what I say that's found in in the 14th chapter of St John four different times he says it in verse 15 in verse 21 in verse 23 and verse 24 how can you say you love me if you don't do what I say but what happens he responds to our actions with the further demonstration of his love Mercy not judging or condemning us forgiving us I'm depending on his mercy and his forgiveness and his love aren't you and we know then what we must do not to earn it but as a response to his unconditional love to us as we close tonight's service let's sing Mercy rewrote my life Mercy re [Music] my Mercy reot [Music] my I should have fallen my soul cast down God Mercy rewrote my life oh mercy rot my life Mercy reot my life I should have fall Fallen my soul cast down God's mercy reot my life Mercy REO my life Mercy re my life I should have fallen my soul cast down God's mercy be my [Music] life brother Brandon makes a statement you ought to be able to bitterly disagree with each other and still love one another I think a lot of us hear the bitterly part and forget the love part but God rich in Mercy while we were yet sinners loved us gave his life for us you'll stand with me he became me so that I might become him rather than say Here I Am the example you've got to work work hard to be like me he said I'm going to go down and I'm going to take your place so that I can be touched by the feeling of your infirmities the struggles you go through and I can reach out he became me so that I might become him my [Music] gra he became me so that I might become him by [Music] Grace he took my place so that I through his love could take it he became me so that I might become him my Grace Grace that unmar favor oh he became me so that I might become him by Grace he became me so that I might become him by Grace he took my place so that I through his love could take care he became me so that I might become my gra he's my Lord there is no other he's my Lord there is no other one who can calm the storms of life like my Lord he gives rest to the we gives new life to the Hopeless there's no doubt how about it he my Lord maybe with a raised hand you give that confession he's my Lord there is no other one who can calm the storms of life like my [Music] Lord he gives rest to the wey gives new life to the hopess there's no doubt about and he my Lord the word of God it it you don't have to be complicated it don't have to be sound so mysterious and God just puts it in Simplicity you know he walked with his disciples and they saw him daily I'm sure at times they scratched their heads and said he's just like us he gets tired he gets weary sometimes he gets angry sometimes you know he's he walked this this life in this flesh to understand us to be able to know who we are like and I appreciate let's just bow our heads Lord as Luke wrote this this book we call the book of Acts the Holy Spirit acting in those in in after acts 238 the Holy Spirit came upon them and filled their lives you said if I don't go away then this Spirit cannot return and it's I not only be with you I'll be in you Lord how how much how often they might have scratched her head and say how can this be you know to see men men that are Fallen failures become Sons and Daughters of God and have the right Spirit turn their cheek be willing to say I forgive father it's contrary to the human nature but Christ in US Lord help us just to yield to surrender to that say Lord have your own way in my life as this service is over it's dismissed Lord as each one goes home Lord and in the rest of this week what they must do Lord may you be Lord in their life Lord we're not going out there look looking to get into trouble or to to to upset people Lord but let us not be afraid to be Christians Lord cuz you'll stand with us Lord let's let
