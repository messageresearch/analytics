[9:39] good morning morning it is so good to be
[9:43] in the house of the Lord with my
[9:45] siblings in Christ we have some brothers
[9:48] and sisters that have brought needs to
[9:50] us and they brought them to us not to
[9:52] bring them to us but that through us it
[9:55] can strengthen their prayer and their
[9:56] reach out to the Lord that we can reach
[9:57] out in faith together on their behalf
[10:01] got a note here that Sister Anne Locker
[10:03] is sick at home requests prayer brother
[10:06] Ronnie glidewell is also sick at home
[10:09] and also desires prayer brother Kenny
[10:12] Phillips is having health issues at this
[10:14] time and my wife Heather's not here this
[10:16] morning she hasn't been feeling well for
[10:18] a few days but she expects to be here
[10:20] this evening um and those are the
[10:24] requests that we have here and I'm I'm
[10:27] going to take a moment of your time time
[10:29] because you need to stand up a little
[10:30] bit get the flood flowing right I've got
[10:33] a little testimony I want to give you
[10:34] because this is December 1st December
[10:36] 1st doesn't mean much to a lot of people
[10:38] but it means a lot to me and it was in
[10:42] 1966 that we left California San Jose
[10:45] area and came down to
[10:47] Tucson um my dad was a very quiet guy
[10:50] and he was never one that would say the
[10:52] Lord told me this or the Lord showed me
[10:54] that that that wasn't my dad but he
[10:57] prayed about it to come down here to
[10:58] Tucson and like the Lord told him arrive
[11:01] on December 1st arrive on December 1st
[11:05] so he came we came through to on that
[11:07] summer and he stopped at the Department
[11:09] of Economic Security whatever it was
[11:11] called in those days and registered that
[11:13] that here's my name and here's how you
[11:15] can reach me and these are my skills and
[11:17] I'll be here on December 1st and my dad
[11:20] was a guy that made uh lenses for for
[11:23] eyasses in those days and and they said
[11:25] don't come there's no work here there's
[11:27] nothing like that this is econ ically
[11:29] depressed don't come don't come don't
[11:31] come he said thank you very much I'll be
[11:33] there on December
[11:34] 1st so so uh so my parents came into
[11:38] town and they arrived uh the early
[11:40] evening of December 1st and and the
[11:44] phone number that my dad had left was
[11:46] with brother Ed dougall's parents who we
[11:48] knew from San Jose sister Joyce and
[11:50] brother Keith and that afternoon the
[11:54] phone rang at the dugall household and
[11:57] it turned out that a fellow would come
[11:58] into town started a place to make
[12:00] glasses hired a guy the guy kept getting
[12:02] drunk he fired him that day and he
[12:04] desperately needed somebody with my
[12:06] dad's exact skills and he needed that
[12:08] person on the afternoon of December 1st
[12:11] and that was a date that months before
[12:13] the Lord had told my dad December 1st
[12:16] December 1st so so December 1st means a
[12:18] lot to me so with that that hopefully
[12:21] boosts all of our faith just a little
[12:23] bit let's turn to the Lord in prayer if
[12:24] you've got something in your heart that
[12:26] you'd like the Lord to to answer
[12:29] raise your hand hold it in your heart
[12:31] whatever you're comfortable with but
[12:32] let's go to the Lord together in unity
[12:35] as the body of Christ in prayer Lord
[12:37] Jesus it is such an honor it is such a
[12:40] privilege to serve a living God lord we
[12:44] know that you know our needs before we
[12:46] even ask your word says that you will
[12:48] answer Lord for these requests that have
[12:50] been made known for for these burdens
[12:53] that are on my brothers and sisters
[12:54] hearts these needs Lord I just pray that
[12:56] you would reach out to each one given
[12:58] that assurance that you are there
[13:00] because Lord we don't have faith to
[13:03] believe this or faith to believe that
[13:05] but we have faith in you and Lord we
[13:08] know that through you you handle it all
[13:10] we thank you we love you Lord Jesus

[34:22] able to to fellowship with family
[34:24] especially around something that's so
[34:26] important I want to share with the
[34:29] church I um there's a sister that um she
[34:33] recently lost her husband she's a member
[34:34] of the church here and um she's really
[34:39] she's never really had the Lord in her
[34:43] life she's never had the Lord's always
[34:44] been in her life I'm sorry but she's
[34:46] never really had Church she's never been
[34:48] to church before and and the church has
[34:51] meant so much to her going through this
[34:54] hard time and losing her husband and and
[34:57] um I called her a couple days ago just
[34:59] to check on her make sure she's doing
[35:02] well and and she was so sweet she said
[35:06] um she immediately kind of got choked up
[35:08] and she said brother Daniel she says um
[35:11] everything's really good she says just
[35:14] really good she says I was able to to
[35:17] sell um she was able to sell um some of
[35:20] her husband's equipment and she said
[35:23] that that the price for the equipment
[35:26] was the
[35:28] money that she needed really to pay off
[35:31] um the biggest part of her debt and and
[35:35] she was just so thankful and she was so
[35:38] thankful for the church and in just her
[35:41] attitude she was saying like Lord is the
[35:43] Lord is just so good to us and
[35:48] then uh she says you know she says I'm
[35:52] uh she said you know my my family um
[35:55] they've been there's they've really been
[35:58] at odds with me trying to have take
[36:02] certain things that that were husbands
[36:04] and and that and and she said that some
[36:06] of the
[36:08] people um either from the neighborhood
[36:11] or from other people that she used to
[36:13] know have been coming around the house
[36:15] and and stealing things and stole just
[36:18] thousands of dollars worth of worth of
[36:22] stuff that was hers that she could have
[36:23] sold that she really needed and and and
[36:26] but she kept saying but but brother
[36:28] Daniel she says but God is so good God
[36:32] is so good to me and there she is this
[36:36] lady she's
[36:37] alone she really doesn't have anyone
[36:41] here but some of the neighborhood some
[36:44] of the people and she lives in a she
[36:45] lives way out there she doesn't have
[36:47] have neighbors really close but some of
[36:49] the neighbors will come and help her out
[36:50] when she needs help and she was quick to
[36:53] recognize them and and just to say how
[36:56] good God is even even though the lady is
[36:59] just
[37:00] struggling but you wouldn't know it with
[37:02] her
[37:03] attitude and it really it made me think
[37:09] first of all made me thank the Lord for
[37:11] all that I
[37:12] have and sometimes it takes
[37:16] losing everything that we have to be
[37:19] grateful for what we do
[37:20] have and brothers and sisters we should
[37:23] all be very very grateful to the Lord
[37:25] for the blessings that he's G given us
[37:28] that that we have a home to go to that
[37:31] we have food on the table that we have a
[37:34] church that we can fellowship at that we
[37:36] have friends that we have family there's
[37:39] just so much that we have our health
[37:41] brother Glenn when when when it when it
[37:44] starts to fade you realize how really
[37:48] important that it
[37:50] is I was praying for her last night and
[37:54] and I went to bed and I was I just I was
[37:57] praying for everybody and and what I
[38:00] do often when I pray is I'll go through
[38:03] each row just in my mind and I'll try to
[38:06] pray for each one that I remember and I
[38:10] was going through last night and praying
[38:12] and I went to bed and and I was just
[38:15] thanking the lord for his goodness and
[38:17] saying Lord
[38:18] just thank you for thank you for being
[38:21] there thank you that that no matter how
[38:24] bad things get no matter no matter what
[38:27] how our life would fall apart that we
[38:29] have a hope of Jesus Christ that we have
[38:33] promises that that this is just for a
[38:35] short time that this suffering is is
[38:37] really it's for our own good it's it's
[38:39] to build our character and then we're
[38:41] going to come out on the other
[38:43] side and I was as I was thinking on that
[38:46] and
[38:47] laying went to sleep and then and then I
[38:50] woke up maybe a few hours
[38:53] later and I uh I I had this thought in
[38:58] my mind just thinking about how
[39:01] important this book is to me and how
[39:05] much just I love it and it's just it's
[39:09] everything and and going through the
[39:11] pages by pages and and and I started
[39:14] thanking the Lord in the middle of the
[39:16] night last night about about how this is
[39:20] a blessing and this is my this is my
[39:21] strength everything else can fail but
[39:24] this will never fail it'll always be
[39:28] there for us and we can we can open it
[39:30] up and we can read these different
[39:31] stories and what's so wonderful is we
[39:34] can apply these different stories to our
[39:36] own
[39:38] lives the thought came to
[39:40] me that this whole
[39:43] book how blessed it is from Genesis to
[39:46] Revelation it's just about two
[39:50] people and the
[39:52] first the very how it starts that in the
[39:56] beginning
[39:59] God and it's about this God this ever
[40:04] existing one and how that there were it
[40:08] gave types and shadows and and it told
[40:12] us about that this one that was to come
[40:16] that was going to be God made flesh and
[40:18] he would make all the wrongs right and
[40:22] he would forgive all the sins and and he
[40:24] would he would be the hope of our
[40:26] salvation
[40:29] it's about that
[40:31] man from Genesis to Revelation it's
[40:33] about him but there's somebody else that
[40:37] this book is
[40:38] about from the same length from all the
[40:41] way from the beginning to the end and
[40:43] that's about
[40:45] me and that's about
[40:47] you so really there's two people that
[40:51] this Bible concentrates on it's the man
[40:54] that died on the cross the man that
[40:57] created the heavens and the Earth the
[40:59] man that promised that he's going to
[41:00] come back the man that wiped all of our
[41:02] sins away the man that is exalted into
[41:06] heaven the the he calls himself I am the
[41:08] alpha and I am the Omega I am the
[41:11] beginning and I am the end it's about
[41:13] him and then it's about
[41:16] me and how this book applies to my
[41:21] life and how he deals with me and my
[41:24] relationship with him and every Prophet
[41:26] that was in the Bible pointed at this
[41:29] man and pointed us to this man and said
[41:33] give your lives to this man serve this
[41:35] man serve this
[41:37] God you do
[41:40] it and I look and and and as I woke up
[41:43] last night and and started writing down
[41:48] on my phone the thought that I
[41:52] had and I believe
[41:56] that if it is there's two
[41:59] people and will we recognize God's
[42:03] kindness to us or will we ignore him and
[42:06] really just live a meaningless life I
[42:09] don't care how great you think you are I
[42:10] don't how great someone could
[42:12] be it's a meaningless life without
[42:15] Christ your life amounts to nothing
[42:18] without him but if you have him just
[42:22] like this sister I was talking about the
[42:24] sister that's there she is right there
[42:26] God bless bless you Sister Connie I'm
[42:28] sorry you were hiding I didn't want to
[42:30] say your name is it okay if I say who it
[42:37] was God bless your loyal heart sister
[42:39] Connie
[42:40] Williams I
[42:42] um you're a
[42:44] blessing and I I hope that um well I
[42:48] know I know that the Lord has touched
[42:51] your life and I know that sister Connie
[42:54] he's going to make a way every step of
[42:56] the way he'll be there for you and you
[42:58] know what you know who else is going to
[42:59] be there we're going to be there for you
[43:02] and we're going to be there with you God
[43:04] bless your heart and and and these this
[43:07] story it's about Connie Williams and
[43:10] Jesus Christ it's about Daniel Evans and
[43:13] Jesus Christ it's about you brother
[43:16] Emanuel and Jesus Christ it's about us
[43:19] and him one person one God and that
[43:22] relationship between the two and he will
[43:25] always make a way
[43:27] and we should be we should give him our
[43:31] gratitude otherwise our life is
[43:35] meaningless you can be we see all these
[43:38] famous people and and it's all dist stir
[43:40] with with the Elon musks and the Donald
[43:43] Trumps and all these different ones
[43:45] their lives are meaningless without
[43:47] Jesus
[43:48] Christ one soul is where 10,000 worlds
[43:52] wow I I appreciate what they're trying
[43:54] to do I do and I support them but what
[43:57] about the soul of a man what about the
[44:00] soul of a woman you know and you think
[44:02] about all these things going going on
[44:04] and it Narrows all the way down to a
[44:06] little Congregation of a couple hundred
[44:10] people and what that congregation is
[44:12] doing and how many
[44:14] Souls how many souls are in this
[44:16] building right now and they mean so much
[44:20] to
[44:21] God he we were in his thoughts before
[44:26] the foundation of the
[44:28] world and he wanted to
[44:31] form this world and he did he separated
[44:35] the light from the darkness he separated
[44:38] the the land from the
[44:41] sea he he made the clouds in the in the
[44:44] skies and he made the water on the earth
[44:46] and he made the fish and he made all the
[44:48] animals for what for his sons and his
[44:52] daughters he made it all for us and we
[44:56] can't give him enough enough thanks we
[44:58] cannot give him enough gratitude I asked
[45:00] Daniel to sing that song this morning
[45:02] gratitude which I just came to the
[45:04] pulpit
[45:05] with Lord I don't have anything to give
[45:08] you there's nothing I can give to you I
[45:11] I'm I'm nothing but I can give you a
[45:14] Hallelujah I can give you a thanks I can
[45:18] give you my love I can give you a clap
[45:22] offering and say Lord I love you so much
[45:27] and I'm so
[45:29] grateful we came through this this
[45:32] Thanksgiving holiday and
[45:35] and I always want to take a a few
[45:38] minutes to go back to our our founding
[45:43] fathers and what they did there was 102
[45:46] of them on the ship that came
[45:49] across the Atlantic Ocean and they
[45:51] settled at Plymouth and and
[45:55] they they uh they had hard they H really
[45:59] hard and they gave what we call this
[46:02] Thanksgiving but this this Thanksgiving
[46:04] this wasn't
[46:05] new this Thanksgiving was what came from
[46:09] the Protestant Revival so many things
[46:11] I've been talking a lot about Martin
[46:12] Luther lately and so much came from him
[46:17] and what he did and standing against the
[46:20] Tyranny and saying that no these things
[46:23] are wrong and standing up for what was
[46:24] right and things like Thanksgiving came
[46:28] actually from him from that Protestant
[46:33] Revival it was all I'll read it it says
[46:35] a day of Thanksgiving might be held in
[46:37] response to the signs of God's mer Mercy
[46:41] such as rain allowing a good harvest
[46:43] arrival of needed supplies or recovery
[46:45] from sickness they might might also be
[46:47] held after a long period of General
[46:49] sickness or lack of
[46:52] disaster we look at our United States
[46:54] now it's been a long time we had covid a
[46:58] little while
[46:59] ago just prepping us maybe for for
[47:03] something that's to come on days of
[47:05] Thanksgiving the faithful would also
[47:07] spend the day in in church
[47:10] attendance would pray thankfully sing
[47:12] psalms of praise and feast Pur and feast
[47:15] days were more than more solemn and
[47:19] demanding than traditional Christian
[47:22] feasts days of Thanksgiving were
[47:24] celebrated with joy and thanks for
[47:27] recent blessings but Puritans also saw
[47:30] them as days to look forward to the com
[47:33] coming of the kingdom of
[47:35] God and that's what led this first
[47:39] Thanksgiving so they there was 102 of
[47:42] them I believe and they they arrived in
[47:44] America and then that first that first
[47:48] year they were
[47:51] dying over half of them died that first
[47:54] winter they struggled
[47:57] they struggled they they died of scurvy
[48:00] they died of malnutrition they died of
[48:02] exposure to the elements they lived on
[48:04] the ship for all that
[48:07] time the Indians God
[48:10] sent these Native Americans leprosy that
[48:13] we understand as leprosy or it could
[48:15] have been some sort of a contagious skin
[48:19] disease leprosy is used in the Bible uh
[48:22] not as a specific necessarily disease
[48:26] but as has a a broad
[48:30] contagious uh really Dreadful skin
[48:33] disease and so what Jesus was telling
[48:37] them he said now you go and you show
[48:42] yourselves to the priests and you wonder
[48:44] why did Jesus say for them to go and
[48:46] show themselves to the
[48:48] priests it
[48:49] wasn't to say hey go show yourselves to
[48:53] the priest and and so they can see that
[48:55] all I've done
[48:57] or they could see that all that God has
[49:00] done through my Ministry that was going
[49:03] to happen but there was a two-fold
[49:06] purpose to them going and showing
[49:08] themselves to the priest
[49:10] first it
[49:12] assured that the person who had that
[49:15] contagious skin disease was cured and
[49:19] and can't spread it to other people so
[49:21] in the Book of Leviticus a a leper would
[49:24] come to the priest after he was healed
[49:26] of of his disease he would come to the
[49:28] priest the priest would examine
[49:31] him and then it was like an 8-day
[49:34] process then the the priest would say go
[49:37] and do this ritualistic bathing and and
[49:40] that type of thing but it it made it to
[49:42] where this person could show Not only
[49:45] was he healed but he could show other
[49:47] people that he's healed and he could go
[49:49] back into the congregation because if he
[49:51] had leprosy he wasn't allowed in the
[49:53] congregation so this would allow this
[49:56] person back in and it may have been some
[49:59] sort of a notorized writing or something
[50:02] he went through here's your leprosy
[50:06] negative report you can go back to your
[50:09] family you can go back to church you can
[50:12] go back and and and and fellowship with
[50:16] um with everyone and and just assimilate
[50:20] back into society and second it allows
[50:24] that person to go back to work
[50:27] to start earning a living and to not be
[50:32] shunned and really
[50:34] third after they had showed themselves
[50:36] to the priest third it did show the
[50:38] glory of Jesus Christ because the
[50:41] priests would be witness to the this
[50:43] healing power that was from this man so
[50:46] this was following the word of God given
[50:49] to the Jewish people by Moses that would
[50:52] allow these men to assimilate back into
[50:56] societ iety after they had been cured of
[50:59] their
[51:01] disease and you'll notice in verse 12 it
[51:05] says that they stood a far off now it's
[51:08] probably because they had to keep their
[51:10] distance in order to keep the law
[51:12] because this was a contagious disease
[51:15] and then as I said after the ceremony
[51:18] they could come
[51:19] back so you can imagine the
[51:23] embarrassment that was on these 10 men
[51:26] and they cried out to Jesus they knew
[51:28] that he could heal the sick so they
[51:29] cried out Lord have mercy Jesus said now
[51:32] you go and show yourselves to the priest
[51:35] they had something to do they had to
[51:38] have faith that Jesus's words were going
[51:40] to be true he said now you go and show
[51:43] yourselves to the priest so they went
[51:45] and as they were following what Jesus
[51:47] said shows that we have to follow what
[51:50] Jesus says first and as they were
[51:53] following what Jesus said they were
[51:56] walking and they saw that their leprosy
[51:59] was gone this dreaded disease they were
[52:02] completely cured so they must have taken
[52:05] off running I want to get to the priest
[52:07] I want to get back into society I want
[52:08] to go have dinner with my family I don't
[52:10] want everybody to shun me and and and
[52:13] and just keep keep away from me I'm
[52:15] embarrassed by
[52:17] it and then as they were going there was
[52:21] one man that turned around
[52:27] let's go back to verse 13 and they
[52:29] lifted up their voices and they said
[52:31] Jesus Master have mercy on us and when
[52:35] he saw them he said unto them go show
[52:38] yourselves unto the priest and it came
[52:39] to pass that as they went they were
[52:41] cleansed so Jesus tells them to do
[52:43] something they had Faith they did it
[52:45] before they were healed they followed
[52:47] what Jesus said they were
[52:50] healed and one of them when he saw that
[52:54] he was healed he turned back and with a
[52:57] loud voice glorify
[53:01] God how many times does the Lord do
[53:04] something for
[53:05] us and we forget to give him credit and
[53:09] it could be a small thing like Josiah
[53:12] like you with your truck the other night
[53:14] Josiah's truck wouldn't start it just
[53:17] turned
[53:19] off and young um Timmy Timmy Robson um
[53:25] Katie's brother
[53:27] he said a
[53:28] prayer that the that the Lord would heal
[53:31] the
[53:32] truck and then we got in there and we we
[53:35] cleaned some things cleaned some posts
[53:38] and it started up and ran
[53:40] fine what's the first thing we should we
[53:43] did was we bowed our heads and we thank
[53:45] God for what he did could it have been
[53:48] and Josiah asked could it have been the
[53:50] prayer or could it have been cleaning
[53:52] the the the battery posts it doesn't
[53:56] matter
[53:57] it was all God so if you brother Glenn
[54:01] if you go to the doctor and the doctor
[54:03] gives you some sort of a treatment and
[54:05] you get healed of your sickness or if
[54:07] you come to the
[54:09] Altar and you get healed of your
[54:11] sickness whichever one it's still God
[54:15] and God should be given the glory for it
[54:17] and these lepers as they went there was
[54:20] only one that turned
[54:24] around and with a loud voice voice
[54:26] glorified God and he fell down on his
[54:30] face at Jesus's
[54:33] feet giving him thanks and he was a
[54:38] Samaritan and Jesus and Jesus answering
[54:41] said we're not 10 cleansed but where are
[54:45] the
[54:46] nine there are not
[54:49] found that returned to give Glory save
[54:53] this stranger wow now a Samaritan we've
[54:57] heard the word Samaritan we know
[55:00] probably you probably understand that a
[55:02] Samaritan is a mixture of Jews and
[55:04] Gentiles these Samaritans go way back
[55:08] we've been talking in our Wednesday
[55:10] night bible study we've been
[55:11] concentrating on the Babylonian
[55:14] captivity and the dispersion of the Jews
[55:17] with Nebuchadnezzar and that so many
[55:18] things happened at that time many
[55:20] prophets prophesied during that time but
[55:21] even before that hundreds of years there
[55:24] was another Invasion by another Empire
[55:27] called the Sy Assyrian Empire they came
[55:30] in to the north of this country and they
[55:35] took captive those from
[55:38] Israel and they dispersed them out and
[55:41] that was the end of the country of
[55:44] Israel there was Israel in the north and
[55:45] Judah in the South that was the end of
[55:48] Israel and even they were gone until
[55:53] recently a few decades ago they came
[55:56] back so there were some people that
[56:00] stayed
[56:01] there and they mixed with the Gentiles
[56:06] so the Jews intermarried with the
[56:09] Gentiles way back during that Assyrian
[56:11] captivity and they formed the Samaritan
[56:15] people a mixture between Jews and
[56:17] Gentiles they followed all the way down
[56:19] Through the Ages and there was fighting
[56:22] between the Jews and the Samaritans the
[56:25] Jews thought they were were
[56:27] unclean because they didn't follow
[56:29] everything that the Jews thought they
[56:30] didn't have that purebred um lineage
[56:33] that the Jews had the Samaritans thought
[56:36] the Jews were wrong because it was like
[56:38] hey you guys left we
[56:40] stayed we're the real true ones from God
[56:43] so there was always this fighting and
[56:45] they didn't mix there was segregation
[56:47] back then and then Jesus is like look at
[56:49] all these other ones left and what comes
[56:52] back a
[56:55] Samaritan that's that's why it was so
[56:57] important that it was a Samaritan verse
[57:00] number 17
[57:03] again and Jesus answering and said were
[57:06] not 10 cleansed but where are the nine
[57:09] there are not found that returned to
[57:11] give glory to God save this
[57:15] stranger and he said unto him arise go
[57:19] thy way thy faith has made thee
[57:22] whole the other ones got healed
[57:25] too I don't know if it it returned or
[57:27] what but but the Bible says that they
[57:29] were healed but this one person came
[57:33] back and Jesus recognized this one
[57:36] person that came back and gave thanks to
[57:39] God for the healing of his
[57:42] sickness there's a reason that it's put
[57:44] into the
[57:45] Bible Jesus
[57:48] appreciated the
[57:51] Gratitude Jesus Is God sir do you think
[57:55] God appreciates our
[57:58] gratitude and we can give him thanks for
[58:01] fixing a battery on a truck we can give
[58:04] him thanks for paying our bills we can
[58:07] give him thanks for healing us we can
[58:09] give him thanks for having a job we can
[58:12] give him thanks and you know what he
[58:15] appreciates it and here's God sitting on
[58:18] his throne and he's thousands of times
[58:21] every second I did this for this person
[58:23] I did this for this person I did this
[58:25] for this person I saved this person this
[58:27] person may be a Hindu this person may be
[58:28] a Buddhist I help them I helped them
[58:30] here I did this I did this and wow how
[58:32] many people really say thank you I
[58:35] cannot stand an ungrateful person it's
[58:38] something that gets really gets under my
[58:40] my skin and entitled person someone that
[58:43] that doesn't say thank
[58:46] you and I can imagine how God
[58:50] feels Jesus here himself it's like there
[58:54] was 10 of you one one person comes back
[58:57] to thank me wow one person comes back to
[59:00] give thanks to God I think nine out of
[59:02] 10 would be I mean one out of 10 would
[59:07] be a
[59:08] great success in today's society but
[59:11] it's one out of a million or one out of
[59:13] a 100 million it's very few that truly
[59:16] give thanks to
[59:18] God Billy Graham in 1952 I was surfing
[59:23] and uh saw this thing that he said he he
[59:26] was it was a Thanksgiving address and he
[59:29] said this he said the American people
[59:30] this year ought to be on their knees
[59:32] right now thanking almighty God for the
[59:35] tremendous and glorious blessings that
[59:37] were received this
[59:39] year and then he goes on to quote Luke
[59:43] 1248 which
[59:45] is to for whom much is given much is
[59:47] required so let's turn there Luke
[59:49] chapter
[59:50] 12 let's start with um 30 verse 39
[59:56] and I'm going to read the the King James
[59:59] um the Old King James is hard to
[1:00:01] understand so put up the Old King James
[1:00:02] but I'm going to read the new King James
[1:00:04] um there's a few words in there that
[1:00:06] don't mean the same thing today so I'm
[1:00:08] going to read the new King James and you
[1:00:10] can follow along um if you want to look
[1:00:11] at the screen on the old King James but
[1:00:14] know this that if the Master of the
[1:00:16] House had known what hour the thief
[1:00:18] would come he would have watched and not
[1:00:20] allowed his house to be broken into
[1:00:23] therefore you also be ready for the son
[1:00:26] of man is coming at an hour that you do
[1:00:28] not expect then Peter said to him Lord
[1:00:32] do you speak this Parable only to
[1:00:35] us or do you speak it to all the people
[1:00:38] so he's like is this just special for us
[1:00:40] disciples or are you saying this to
[1:00:44] everyone and the Lord said I love the
[1:00:47] way Luke says the Lord said speaking of
[1:00:50] Jesus and the Lord said who then is that
[1:00:54] faithful and wise Steward whom in Master
[1:00:56] will make ruler over his household to
[1:00:58] give them their portion of food in due
[1:01:00] season blessed is that servant whom his
[1:01:03] master will find do so doing when he
[1:01:06] comes truly I say to you that he will
[1:01:08] make him ruler over all that he
[1:01:11] has but if that servant says in his
[1:01:14] heart my master is delaying his coming
[1:01:16] and begins to beat male and female
[1:01:19] servants and to eat and drink and be
[1:01:22] drunk the master of that servant will
[1:01:24] come on a day when he he's not looking
[1:01:26] for
[1:01:29] him and at an hour when he is not
[1:01:33] aware and will cut him in two and
[1:01:36] appoint him his portion with the
[1:01:39] unbelievers and that servant who knew
[1:01:43] his master's
[1:01:45] will and did not prepare himself or do
[1:01:50] according to his will shall be beaten
[1:01:53] with many stripes
[1:01:56] but he who did not know and yet
[1:02:00] committed things deserving of Stripes
[1:02:03] shall be beaten with a few so the one
[1:02:05] that knew better he's going to suffer
[1:02:07] more the one that didn't know better
[1:02:09] he's still going to suffer but he's not
[1:02:12] going to suffer as the as much as the
[1:02:14] one that knew
[1:02:16] better for everyone to whom much is
[1:02:21] given from him much will be
[1:02:24] required and to whom much has been
[1:02:27] committed of him they will ask the
[1:02:31] more so I ask in all of us have we seen
[1:02:35] the Lord working in our
[1:02:37] lives have you been introduced to A
[1:02:39] Jesus Christ that can do all things that
[1:02:42] he's not hindered by anything do you
[1:02:45] know do you truly know this one
[1:02:50] Jesus
[1:02:52] or do you
[1:02:54] just you hear about him but then we go
[1:02:58] along doing our thing we go along
[1:03:01] following our own mind and we forget to
[1:03:03] God to give God credit and we forget or
[1:03:06] don't even think or just willingly don't
[1:03:08] do what he
[1:03:10] said as I as I was talking about the
[1:03:12] Bible at the beginning have we not been
[1:03:15] given a
[1:03:16] Bible we've been given one and in
[1:03:19] today's society it's hard for the
[1:03:22] younger generation to sit down and read
[1:03:23] the book
[1:03:25] it's all right it's just the way putting
[1:03:29] the the the the phone in front of them
[1:03:32] it's it's hard to keep track and it's
[1:03:34] hard for them to focus so did he not he
[1:03:37] he gave you a Bible but but understand
[1:03:39] it's hard to read the Bible for some he
[1:03:41] gave you a Bible app so you can listen
[1:03:44] to it you're not limited to just the
[1:03:47] Bible he gave you the Bible in audio
[1:03:49] form if you don't like to read or you
[1:03:51] have trouble reading listen to it all of
[1:03:53] us have access to that
[1:03:56] that's right we need constant
[1:03:59] stimulation there's your stimulation
[1:04:01] listen to your Bible if you don't want
[1:04:03] to listen to it it's on YouTube too turn
[1:04:06] on YouTube and watch the Bible there's
[1:04:09] all kinds of good stuff on there but
[1:04:11] it's it's hard the devil throws all
[1:04:14] these things in front of us well we can
[1:04:16] turn our mind and God can take the
[1:04:18] things that the devil has put in front
[1:04:19] of us and then he can use him for his
[1:04:22] glory compare the time compare the time
[1:04:26] that we spend on our devices to the time
[1:04:30] that we spend on the things of the Lord
[1:04:32] now take your device and use it for the
[1:04:34] things of the
[1:04:37] Lord you can have you say well you know
[1:04:40] brother Daniel I read it and it's hard
[1:04:41] to understand he gave you all these
[1:04:43] other translations
[1:04:44] Now 50 60 years ago we just had the King
[1:04:47] James and maybe one other one now you
[1:04:51] have other translations that are just as
[1:04:54] accurate you can't you can't understand
[1:04:56] this one here you have other
[1:04:59] ones you know you have the English
[1:05:01] Standard Version is excellent you have
[1:05:02] the new King James version which is
[1:05:04] basically the King James that kind of
[1:05:06] takes out the these and the
[1:05:08] THS and changes some of the words that
[1:05:10] don't mean the same today as they did
[1:05:13] then and give we use the King James here
[1:05:16] but he gave you if you don't like it he
[1:05:18] gave you other
[1:05:20] ones Isaiah said when Satan comes in
[1:05:23] like a flood and he has
[1:05:26] then God will raise up a standard
[1:05:28] against
[1:05:30] him he comes in and he he distracts us
[1:05:33] with all these things God says okay I'm
[1:05:35] going to take that and I'm going to use
[1:05:36] it for my glory I'm going to take the
[1:05:38] internet I'm going to use it for my
[1:05:39] glory I'm going to take your phone I'm
[1:05:41] going to use it for my glory I'm going
[1:05:42] to take a book and I'm going to use it
[1:05:44] for my glory I'm going to take Sunday
[1:05:46] morning where you used to be doing
[1:05:49] something
[1:05:50] else and I'm going to use it for my
[1:05:52] glory I'm going to bring you into church
[1:05:57] let's read it Isaiah 59:19 says this so
[1:06:00] shall they fear the name of the Lord
[1:06:02] from the west and and His glory from the
[1:06:04] rising of the sun when the enemy shall
[1:06:06] come in like a flood the spirit of the
[1:06:08] Lord shall lift up a standard against
[1:06:10] him so when Satan comes in with all the
[1:06:14] distractions God raises up a standard
[1:06:16] against him by using the same vehicle of
[1:06:18] delivery for those distractions to give
[1:06:21] you salvation through his word and the
[1:06:24] Redeemer shall come to iion and unto
[1:06:26] them that turn from transgression in
[1:06:28] Jacob sayeth the Lord as for me this is
[1:06:31] my Covenant with them sayeth the Lord my
[1:06:33] spirit that is upon thee and my words
[1:06:36] which have which I have put in thy mouth
[1:06:38] shall not depart out of thy mouth nor
[1:06:42] out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of
[1:06:44] the mouth of thy seed seed sayeth the
[1:06:46] Lord from henceforth and
[1:06:49] forever to quote another scripture he's
[1:06:52] talking about the word of God here and
[1:06:54] he's saying I'm going to put this he's
[1:06:56] telling Isaiah you tell them I'm going
[1:06:57] to put this to to give it to you and to
[1:07:00] your
[1:07:01] children and then this word is always
[1:07:04] going to be with you and it's never
[1:07:05] going to depart from you it'll stay in
[1:07:07] your mouth you'll be quoting it together
[1:07:09] as a family you'll be talking about it
[1:07:11] you'll be encouraging each other there's
[1:07:14] another scripture that says almost the
[1:07:16] same thing talking about the spirit of
[1:07:17] God that comes down and dwells in a in a
[1:07:20] person when they receive the Holy Spirit
[1:07:23] Peter said This Promise of the the holy
[1:07:26] spirit is to you to your children and to
[1:07:31] them that are far off even as many as
[1:07:33] the Lord Our God so shall call that same
[1:07:36] spirit and here's Isaiah saying the same
[1:07:38] thing this word of God is going to be
[1:07:41] with you it's going to be comforting you
[1:07:43] all the time stay in it and when the
[1:07:46] enemy comes in like a flood and brings
[1:07:49] distractions on that don't worry God's
[1:07:50] going to raise up a standard against
[1:07:52] it use that standard don't try to force
[1:07:55] yourself into something that you can't
[1:07:57] do go ahead and use the gifts that God
[1:08:00] gave
[1:08:04] you you know we talk about going to
[1:08:07] church for those of you who have trouble
[1:08:09] coming to church I didn't go to church
[1:08:11] until I was 19 years
[1:08:13] old never went we stayed home we
[1:08:17] listened to a tape on a tape sermon on
[1:08:19] Sunday morning and that was
[1:08:22] it that was that was my word
[1:08:26] my aunt Jacqueline gave me a Bible when
[1:08:28] I was in fifth grade and I fell in love
[1:08:31] with it and I didn't understand a whole
[1:08:33] lot of it it was hard for me to
[1:08:35] understand but I I still read it and
[1:08:37] then later
[1:08:39] on we uh when I was 19 we started coming
[1:08:42] to church as a as a family just on
[1:08:45] Sunday morning and I I liked it man I
[1:08:48] liked being around the people so I
[1:08:50] started coming more and Stephanie and I
[1:08:54] we got married
[1:08:56] and we started coming and we never
[1:08:57] missed a service after that it was
[1:08:59] constantly all the time be just just
[1:09:01] taking in these blessings but you have
[1:09:04] to overcome you have to make an effort
[1:09:07] you have to make an effort to open your
[1:09:08] Bible you have to make an effort to come
[1:09:09] to church and sometimes it's it's
[1:09:13] hard but what better thing you going to
[1:09:19] do all the times I miss church I have no
[1:09:23] I can't remember what I did I can guess
[1:09:27] you
[1:09:28] know
[1:09:31] something but the times I went to church
[1:09:33] I
[1:09:34] remember it was a
[1:09:36] blessing we can skip church we can miss
[1:09:38] church believe
[1:09:40] me you're not going to remember that
[1:09:42] football
[1:09:43] game for for years to come it's not
[1:09:47] important but something may happen in
[1:09:50] church that is important
[1:09:56] even even when I was part of a church
[1:09:59] that there was a lot of turmoil even in
[1:10:01] all that turmoil I was still blessed to
[1:10:03] be
[1:10:04] there I still was better off going than
[1:10:09] not going and as I said we can complain
[1:10:13] about church and I can't stand a
[1:10:16] complainer you know I don't want to go
[1:10:17] to church the services are too long I
[1:10:19] got so many things I need to do you
[1:10:22] know what's more important what's more
[1:10:24] important than this
[1:10:26] soul and what's more important than the
[1:10:28] souls of the people here you say I don't
[1:10:31] like going to church I have a I I can't
[1:10:34] get up early I have too many things to
[1:10:35] do well what about the person that you
[1:10:38] come in and you can be a blessing
[1:10:40] too it's not always about
[1:10:44] you and thank the Lord that we have a
[1:10:47] place thank the Lord that you have a job
[1:10:50] I hear people complaining all the time I
[1:10:52] can't stand my job I hate getting up
[1:10:53] early I hate working hard I don't like
[1:10:55] the people I work with but you have a
[1:10:57] job you have an income thank God there's
[1:11:00] many that don't you're able to get an
[1:11:03] income I've talked to many people many a
[1:11:06] few that they can't get a legitimate job
[1:11:09] because they're not citizens of the
[1:11:11] country wonderful people that aren't
[1:11:14] legally allowed to do it you know what
[1:11:17] they would give to have what you have to
[1:11:19] have what I have and then we would
[1:11:20] complain about our
[1:11:24] job Paul said in Philippians
[1:11:26] 4:11 he says this not that I speak in
[1:11:29] respect of want I have learned in
[1:11:32] whatsoever State I am therewith to be
[1:11:35] content I know both how to be abased and
[1:11:38] I know how to abound everywhere in all
[1:11:41] things I am instructed both to be full
[1:11:43] and to be hungry both to abound and to
[1:11:46] suffer need I can do all things through
[1:11:48] Christ which strengthen is me good or
[1:11:52] bad I'm not going to complain is what
[1:11:55] Paul's saying if the situation gets
[1:11:57] really bad I can do all things through
[1:12:00] Christ that strengthens me no matter
[1:12:03] what it is I can do it God's with
[1:12:07] me I want to I'm going to devote the
[1:12:10] rest of the
[1:12:11] service to I want to read some of my
[1:12:15] favorite scriptures we talk about
[1:12:17] Thanksgiving we talk about how how good
[1:12:19] God is and and we can get around the
[1:12:21] supper table and and than and just just
[1:12:24] go over about how how many wonderful
[1:12:27] blessings that he has to us but the
[1:12:28] biggest blessing in my life brothers and
[1:12:31] sisters is this
[1:12:33] book because John said in the beginning
[1:12:39] was the
[1:12:40] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:12:43] Word was
[1:12:45] God this book is God in letter
[1:12:49] form and it is a lamp to our feet Psalm
[1:12:53] 119 says this 11 191

[1:12:59] inspiration on the psalmist how sweet
[1:13:02] are thy words unto my
[1:13:04] taste sweeter than honey to my mouth

[1:13:09] precepts I get understanding therefore I
[1:13:11] hate every false way Thy word is a lamp
[1:13:14] unto my feet and a light unto my P path

[1:13:20] I will keep thy righteous judgments I am
[1:13:23] Afflicted very much Quicken Me Lord Lord
[1:13:25] what does that mean make me alive
[1:13:27] Lord according to Thy
[1:13:30] word he says your word Lord It's a lamp
[1:13:33] to my feet it's like walking around in
[1:13:36] the desert there's Cactus everywhere and
[1:13:37] it's dark you're walking around you're
[1:13:40] going to get stuck you're going to fall
[1:13:41] in a hole you're going to fall off a
[1:13:42] cliff but Lord your word lights it up
[1:13:47] and I can see where I'm going and I can
[1:13:49] stay on the path that is what your word
[1:13:51] means to me

[1:13:59] law the word the law is the
[1:14:03] word but let thine heart keep my
[1:14:05] Commandments for length of days and long

[1:14:54] and all wisdom teaching and admonishing
[1:14:57] one another in Psalms and hymns and
[1:15:00] spiritual songs singing with Grace in
[1:15:03] your hearts to the Lord Daniel I I
[1:15:07] appreciate so

[1:15:34] wherever you go wherever you walk do it
[1:15:37] in the name of the Lord Jesus ask
[1:15:38] yourself this qu question and I promise
[1:15:41] you you'll never make a
[1:15:42] mistake you'll never do something
[1:15:45] wrong would Jesus do
[1:15:49] this would Jesus say

[1:16:38] also in him and he shall bring it to
[1:16:43] pass that should lift our faith Jeremiah
[1:16:46] 23 this is one of my favorite verses
[1:16:49] Jeremiah 23:23 says
[1:16:52] this am I am I a god at
[1:16:57] hand sayeth the Lord and not a god a far
[1:17:02] off so am I a God that's close or am I a
[1:17:05] god that's way way
[1:17:08] off I think he's a god close brothers
[1:17:12] and sisters and he's as close as we
[1:17:14] bring him can any hide himself in a
[1:17:16] secret in secret places that I shall not
[1:17:19] see him sayeth the Lord do not I fill
[1:17:22] Heaven and Earth sayeth the Lord do not
[1:17:25] I fill Heaven and Earth this is the one
[1:17:29] that's got like a hundred million angels
[1:17:32] singing praises to him every every
[1:17:36] moment and he says do not I
[1:17:39] fill the Heaven and the Earth and you
[1:17:41] can ask
[1:17:43] me Joshua 1 verse
[1:17:48] 6 Moses had
[1:17:50] died Joshua was taking up his
[1:17:53] mantle the Lord says be strong and of of
[1:17:57] a good courage For unto this people
[1:17:59] shalt thou divide for an inheritance the
[1:18:01] land which I swear under the fathers to
[1:18:04] give them only be thou strong and very
[1:18:07] courageous that thou mayest observe to
[1:18:10] do according to all the law the
[1:18:13] word which Moses my servant commanded
[1:18:16] thee turn not from it to the right hand
[1:18:19] or to the left hand that thou mayest
[1:18:22] Prosper wherever thou go
[1:18:25] don't turn from the word stay in the
[1:18:27] word and you will prosper this book of
[1:18:30] the law shall not depart out of your
[1:18:32] mouth you're always talking about it but
[1:18:35] Thou shalt meditate therein day and
[1:18:37] night that thou mayest observe to do
[1:18:40] according to all that is written
[1:18:43] therein for then Thou shalt make thy way
[1:18:48] prosperous and thou shalt have good
[1:18:51] success notice he said you will make
[1:18:54] make your way
[1:18:56] prosperous you will make your way
[1:18:59] prosperous how could he say that have
[1:19:02] not I commanded thee be strong and be of
[1:19:04] be of good courage Be not Afraid neither
[1:19:07] be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is
[1:19:09] with thee wherever thou
[1:19:11] goest he's with
[1:19:14] you and you will make your way
[1:19:18] prosperous you have something to do
[1:19:21] believe on this word act on this word do
[1:19:24] this word word again these are just some
[1:19:26] of my favorite scriptures I want to give
[1:19:28] the Lord praise to them Isaiah 40: 29 he
[1:19:31] giveth power to the faint and to them
[1:19:33] that have no might he increases strength
[1:19:36] even the youth shall faint and be weary
[1:19:38] and the young men shall utterly fall but
[1:19:40] they that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:19:44] their strength they shall Mount up with
[1:19:46] wings as eagles they shall run and not
[1:19:48] be weary they shall walk and they shall
[1:19:52] not faint
[1:19:55] imagine Romans 15:1 says
[1:19:58] this we then that are strong ought to
[1:20:01] Bear the infirmities of the
[1:20:03] weak and not to please
[1:20:06] ourselves we're to help other people out

[1:20:12] us please his neighbor for his good
[1:20:14] edification for even Christ pleased not
[1:20:16] himself but as it is written the
[1:20:18] reproaches of them that reproach thee
[1:20:21] fell on me for whatsoever things were
[1:20:23] written a for time were written for our
[1:20:26] learning he's saying this Bible was
