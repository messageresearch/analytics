[38:55] okay we're gonna if you remain standing
[38:57] while we read from our bibles three
[38:59] brief texts
[39:00] they're from paul's epistles the first
[39:02] two are from ii timothy
[39:05] this is thought to be the very last
[39:07] epistle from paul
[39:09] during his execution paul wanted to
[39:10] share these final thoughts with his
[39:13] fellow minister a young man with great
[39:15] promise a person whom paul loved deeply
[39:18] he loved him enough that he directed his
[39:20] final written words to him
[39:23] and we have them today second timothy 3
[39:25] starting at verse 15 is very familiar to
[39:27] all of us
[39:28] paul says and that from a child timothy
[39:32] you've known the holy scriptures
[39:34] he's referring to the tanakh what we
[39:36] call the old testament the earlier
[39:39] covenant between god and israel the holy
[39:41] writings which are able to make thee
[39:44] wise
[39:45] not just knowledge but wisdom
[39:47] how to apply that knowledge
[39:49] unto salvation through memorization and
[39:52] drilling continually
[39:54] no through bible-based faith which is
[39:58] and must be
[40:00] in christ jesus
[40:02] all scripture
[40:04] every word of that tanakh is given by
[40:06] inspiration of god other translations
[40:08] read is god breathed
[40:11] and is profitable
[40:13] that means you receive more than you
[40:15] invest
[40:16] this is not a losing proposition the
[40:18] more you invest
[40:20] the more profit you derive
[40:22] is profitable for doctrine
[40:24] knowledge of god his ways his nature for
[40:27] reproof
[40:28] conviction evidence for correction
[40:32] the word there literally means
[40:33] straightening up again
[40:35] for instruction
[40:37] education teaching
[40:39] and righteousness
[40:41] right relationship to god
[40:43] why
[40:44] to what end
[40:46] to serve what purpose
[40:48] that the man of god the believer
[40:50] may be perfect
[40:52] whole
[40:53] complete
[40:55] mature
[40:56] thoroughly furnished completely equipped
[40:59] unto all knowledge to debate and argue
[41:02] no no the purpose is good works
[41:06] now paul wrote this not james
[41:10] a bit earlier in this letter paul gives
[41:11] timothy instruction about the holy
[41:13] scriptures that timothy has known since
[41:15] childhood second timothy 2
[41:18] beginning at verse 14 another familiar
[41:21] passage
[41:23] of these things now paul has just
[41:26] written about patience suffering
[41:28] endurance
[41:30] drawing on comparisons to being a
[41:31] soldier or a farmer dying to oneself he
[41:35] says of these things put them who
[41:39] is talking about faithful men to carry
[41:41] to others in later times in various
[41:44] places put them in remembrance
[41:47] tell them
[41:48] more than once
[41:50] remind them
[41:52] charging
[41:53] testifying witnessing to them before the
[41:55] lord this is serious timothy before the
[41:58] lord that they strive or dispute or
[42:00] argue not about words to no prophet
[42:04] such things lead to the subverting
[42:06] overthrowing overturning of the hearers
[42:10] that's a very strong admonition
[42:13] he says study timothy immerse yourself
[42:16] in the scriptures
[42:18] to show
[42:19] to display
[42:21] to stand to prove thyself approved
[42:24] properly acceptable unto
[42:26] others
[42:27] so they can admire you
[42:29] no study to show yourselves approved
[42:31] unto god
[42:33] this is how you meet god's approval
[42:35] timothy
[42:36] study learn until you become a workman
[42:39] now's not the time to rest get up and
[42:41] get busy
[42:42] that needeth not to be ashamed
[42:44] embarrassed
[42:45] rightly dividing it means to make a
[42:48] straight cut or to dissect the word of
[42:51] truth
[42:52] finally we'll read from second
[42:54] corinthians 3 to shed some light on what
[42:56] paul might have meant when he said to
[42:58] study or rightly divide or be a minister
[43:02] ii corinthians 3
[43:04] verses 5 and 6.
[43:06] paul says not that we are sufficient
[43:08] we're not competent or qualified of
[43:10] ourselves to think anything is of
[43:12] ourselves but our competence our
[43:14] qualifications our sufficiency
[43:16] is of god
[43:18] who also who god also hath made us able
[43:22] ministers of the new testament this new
[43:24] covenant this new contract
[43:27] not of the letter
[43:28] in other words we use words but we're
[43:31] not ministering words but of the spirit
[43:35] we're using words
[43:36] to minister the spirit
[43:39] why because the letter kills
[43:42] but the spirit gives life
[43:45] and that's what we're supposed to be
[43:46] ministering is life satan knows the
[43:48] letter knows it well
[43:50] but lacks the life
[43:52] please be seated
[43:56] this evening
[43:57] probably is no surprise we'll do
[43:59] something a little different
[44:02] i want to start
[44:04] with a brief story
[44:06] from the babylonian talmud
[44:09] now the talmud is a collection of
[44:11] writings
[44:13] from those that judaism called
[44:15] sages
[44:17] after the tanakh was compiled we call
[44:19] the old testament
[44:21] no person in judaism was ever again
[44:24] called a prophet
[44:25] those held in high regard
[44:27] whose wisdom was well respected
[44:30] were called sages
[44:32] the babylonian talmud was begun during
[44:35] the exile after the destruction of
[44:37] jerusalem
[44:39] was compiled over a period of several
[44:42] centuries
[44:45] there was a sage
[44:47] whose name was hillel
[44:49] he was highly respected within judaism
[44:52] but you might call a sage's sage
[44:55] he was born in babylon in the first
[44:57] century bc
[45:00] we're told he was from a very poor
[45:01] family
[45:03] but was a brilliant student
[45:06] he made his way to jerusalem to study
[45:09] eventually
[45:11] hillel became the president of the
[45:13] sanhedrin
[45:15] josephus tells us that hillel died in 10
[45:18] a.d at the approximate age of 120 100
[45:21] 1920 somewhere in there
[45:24] well at that time jesus would have been
[45:26] a teenager
[45:28] he may have still been the head of that
[45:30] council when shortly after his birth
[45:32] jesus was brought to the temple by
[45:34] joseph and mary for her right of
[45:36] purification
[45:38] we're all familiar with the story in
[45:40] luke's gospel of anna and simeon seeing
[45:42] the infant jesus there
[45:45] hello was an old man when jesus was born
[45:47] but he was a contemporary
[45:50] he may have even been one of those that
[45:52] marveled at jesus wisdom when he stayed
[45:54] behind at the temple after the passover
[45:56] feast
[45:57] and mary and joseph went looking for him
[46:00] if josephus is correct and the dates
[46:03] claimed for the life of hillel then he
[46:05] certainly would have been in jerusalem
[46:07] at that time around 6 or 7 a.d although
[46:10] a very very old man
[46:12] even older than me
[46:14] both of these events are related in luke
[46:16] chapter 2.
[46:19] hillel had a grandson
[46:21] his name was gamalia
[46:24] and he's the very same gamalia that
[46:26] intervened at the council and advised
[46:28] the sanhedrin to not be hasty in judging
[46:31] peter and the apostles
[46:33] we read about this in acts 5 34-40
[46:37] and he's almost certainly the same
[46:39] gamalia under whom paul studied torah
[46:42] related in acts 22 3.
[46:46] hello we're told was a gentle and humble
[46:48] person
[46:49] interpreted jewish law in a somewhat
[46:51] tolerant some say lenient fashion
[46:54] a colleague of his on the council
[46:57] named shamai followed a very strict
[46:59] interpretation of the law
[47:01] shamai and hillel were often in
[47:04] disagreement
[47:06] the story i want to share is found in
[47:08] the babylonian talmud it's a
[47:11] section called shabbat 31a in case you
[47:14] want to look it up
[47:15] it says there was another incident
[47:18] involving the gentile
[47:20] who came before shammai and said to
[47:22] shamai convert me to judaism
[47:25] on condition that you teach me the
[47:28] entire torah
[47:29] while i stand on one foot
[47:34] shamai pushed him away with his
[47:36] builder's cubit a common measuring thing
[47:39] his his trade was
[47:40] that of a builder
[47:43] so what happens
[47:47] is the same gentile
[47:50] came before hillel
[47:52] he again said convert me on condition
[47:54] that you teach me the entire torah while
[47:57] i stand on one foot
[48:02] hillel converted him
[48:04] he said to him
[48:06] that which is hateful to you
[48:08] do not do to another
[48:11] that is the entire torah
[48:13] the rest is its interpretation now go
[48:16] study
[48:19] as we'll see in a moment
[48:21] jesus said the same thing
[48:24] the scripture on which hillel based this
[48:26] interpretation is leviticus 19 18.
[48:31] thou shalt not avenge nor bear any
[48:33] grudge against the children of thy
[48:34] people but thou shalt love thy neighbor
[48:36] as thyself
[48:38] i am the lord
[48:41] well let's read how jesus said it
[48:44] this is part of the sermon on the mount
[48:47] matthew 7 12
[48:49] jesus said therefore
[48:51] all things whatsoever you would that men
[48:54] should do to you
[48:56] even so to them
[48:59] this is the law and the prophets
[49:02] it's of course what we often call the
[49:04] golden rule
[49:05] notice that both hillel
[49:08] and jesus
[49:09] interpreted the admonition in leviticus
[49:12] of loving one's neighbor
[49:14] as being active not passive
[49:18] hillel said to never subject others to
[49:21] what you yourself hate
[49:24] then he said the rest of the torah the
[49:26] pentateuch the five books of moses is
[49:29] commentary on this
[49:32] all of it
[49:34] from genesis 1 1 through deuteronomy 34
[49:37] 12.
[49:40] jesus
[49:41] said to treat men as you desire them to
[49:43] treat you
[49:45] his use of the word men means humankind
[49:48] not just males of our species
[49:51] for both hillel
[49:53] and jesus
[49:54] this is a huge expansion of the word
[49:57] neighbor
[49:59] later jesus would tell the story the
[50:01] good samaritan to underscore this point
[50:03] when asked well who is my neighbor
[50:07] but here jesus said the law and the
[50:09] prophets
[50:11] he goes beyond the torah beyond the five
[50:13] books of moses to incorporate the entire
[50:16] old testament
[50:18] that it all
[50:20] had this foundation
[50:23] these are both prescriptions
[50:25] about what we do
[50:27] how we act
[50:29] toward others not just on what we think
[50:31] or claim our attitude to be
[50:34] not just our words
[50:36] but our actions
[50:38] our faith is expressed in our works
[50:42] our deeds
[50:43] our interactions with others not just
[50:45] the letter of the written word but the
[50:47] spirit the life veiled within it
[50:50] for the jews not just their fellow jews
[50:53] for us
[50:55] not just to other believers
[50:58] jesus references to love
[51:00] and all the new testament writers for
[51:02] that matter regardless of the
[51:03] distinctions between the greek words of
[51:05] agapo and filio
[51:08] all these references are active
[51:10] hands-on expressions not just feelings
[51:13] or emotions or attitudes
[51:17] later in the temple during his final
[51:19] week
[51:20] priority his crucifixion
[51:22] jesus expounded a bit on this
[51:24] commandment we read in mark 12 28
[51:28] and one of the scribes came and having
[51:30] heard jesus and the pharisees reasoning
[51:33] together
[51:34] and perceiving that jesus had answered
[51:37] them well asked him which is the first
[51:40] the greatest
[51:41] the most important commandment of all
[51:46] and jesus answered the scribe
[51:49] he said the first of all the
[51:51] commandments
[51:53] the greatest
[51:54] the most important thing
[51:56] is hear o israel
[51:59] the lord our god
[52:01] is one lord
[52:03] this is generally known within judaism
[52:06] as the shema
[52:08] listen with intelligence and
[52:09] understanding
[52:11] pay close attention oh chosen of god
[52:13] the lord our god the lord is one we'll
[52:16] talk a little bit about the sheman in a
[52:18] moment
[52:19] and thou shalt love thou shalt have
[52:22] agapo affection for the lord thy god
[52:25] with all thy heart
[52:28] thoughts feelings with all thy soul life
[52:32] literally breath
[52:35] and with all thy mind
[52:37] understanding
[52:38] and with all thy strength
[52:41] forcefulness forcefulness might
[52:44] ability this is the first commandment
[52:47] this is the greatest this is the most
[52:48] important commandment this is from
[52:50] deuteronomy 6 4 and 5. it's not even
[52:53] part of the ten commandments and this
[52:55] this phrase all by mind was added by
[52:57] jesus it's not in deuteronomy
[53:01] he goes on he says the second is like
[53:04] it's similar it's the same it's a kin
[53:07] namely this thou shalt love thy neighbor
[53:10] as thyself
[53:11] there's none other commandment
[53:14] none
[53:16] other commandment greater than these
[53:20] and as we just read that in leviticus
[53:22] it's not part of the ten commandments
[53:23] either in matthew's account of this
[53:25] moment we read that jesus further stated
[53:29] on these two commandments hang all the
[53:32] law and the prophets
[53:36] so we say the ten commandments are built
[53:39] on this foundation
[53:40] all the 613 commandments in the
[53:42] pentateuch have this at their heart
[53:45] all the prophecies about the coming
[53:48] messiah our savior are built on these
[53:52] all of them
[53:53] the entire bible jesus says is derived
[53:56] from these everything
[53:58] that's what he said right
[54:01] and if the message we hold so dear is
[54:03] based on the bible which it must be
[54:06] then the entire message brought by
[54:08] brother branham hangs on these two
[54:09] commandments as well
[54:13] and just as hillel told the gentile to
[54:15] then go study
[54:17] paul told timothy study to show thyself
[54:19] approved just as paul did going into
[54:21] arabia after his road to damascus
[54:23] experience his encounter with the lord
[54:27] we're told to read our bible and pray
[54:30] daily
[54:32] not just oh i've read this verse no
[54:34] read it
[54:36] go study brother daniel evans emphasized
[54:38] that to us this last sunday morning
[54:41] now
[54:42] about that shema
[54:44] is a hebrew word and it means here it
[54:46] means listen
[54:47] but it's a it's a
[54:49] it's a an emphatic form of it it isn't
[54:52] like well listen it's listen
[54:55] listen up
[54:57] pay attention
[55:00] the the complete jewish bible does a
[55:03] kind of a transliteration
[55:04] israel
[55:14] and in judaism whenever the
[55:17] the four letters that tetragrammatron
[55:19] the yhwh we sometimes say is yahweh or
[55:22] jehovah they never pronounce that
[55:25] if they're reading the scripture they
[55:26] never say it the only time that word is
[55:29] was ever pronounced was when the high
[55:32] priest on yom kippur
[55:34] went
[55:35] into the holy of holies and had the rope
[55:37] tied around his foot so that if the bell
[55:39] stopped jingling they'd pull them back
[55:41] out that was the only time that word was
[55:43] ever expressed
[55:46] so when they say the term adonai adonai
[55:49] means lord and it's derived from
[55:51] sovereignty so it's really saying
[55:53] sovereign lord
[55:55] sometimes in hebrew they'll say hashem
[55:57] which simply means the name
[56:00] but in our king james old testament it's
[56:02] always capital l capital o capital r
[56:04] capital d
[56:07] well in the mid 70s as i'm sure all of
[56:10] you know by now and may be tired of
[56:12] hearing it heather and i lived in israel
[56:15] i rode the bus from our apartment in
[56:16] netanya
[56:18] to downtown netanya then changed buses
[56:21] to take a bus to tel aviv and then got
[56:23] out of the bus and got into an ll worker
[56:26] bus to go to the airport
[56:27] so this trek started about 5 30 every
[56:30] morning six days a week the only day off
[56:33] was saturday shabbat at that time so we
[56:36] at church on saturday
[56:38] on the highway from netanya to tel aviv
[56:40] the bus driver always had the radio on
[56:43] and tuned to cole israel which means
[56:46] voice of israel it's the national radio
[56:49] network station at that time and every
[56:51] morning as that station came on the air
[56:53] they weren't on the air 24 hours a day
[56:56] i'd hear deuteronomy 6 4
[56:58] the shma
[57:00] and the form of the song
[57:03] is
[57:08] [Music]
[57:16] [Music]
[57:24] god they repeat that
[57:27] several times and they had music and it
[57:30] sounded a lot better than i do but i
[57:31] would hear that every morning and so did
[57:33] everyone in israel
[57:35] that turned on their radio whether they
[57:37] were an arab whether they were a jew a
[57:39] christian or
[57:41] or none of the above
[57:42] that's
[57:43] how the day started in israel every day
[57:47] it's the core tenet of judaism
[57:50] and as we just read
[57:51] jesus proclaimed it is the most
[57:53] important thing one could know
[57:55] as he conversed with his scribe at the
[57:57] very end of his earthly ministry
[58:01] well bringing this to our day
[58:03] imagine a person comes to you seeking
[58:05] the lord
[58:06] wanting to know god or more about god
[58:10] having heard you will follow with a
[58:11] message he or she then says
[58:13] teach me the message of william branham
[58:16] while i stand on one foot
[58:20] the response most of us might give
[58:23] might be a bit like shamai i don't know
[58:25] but it would probably be such length
[58:26] that the seeker would soon tire and fall
[58:29] down
[58:30] walk away
[58:31] too complicated
[58:33] too much jargon
[58:34] don't understand the context
[58:37] so the challenge is simply this
[58:40] how to tell what we mean by the message
[58:43] while the listener is standing on one
[58:46] foot
[58:47] and that's the title of tonight's lesson
[58:50] on one foot and i want to thank kenneth
[58:52] for being such a good model for us
[58:57] well in algebra
[58:58] we'd be reducing an equation or an
[59:01] expression to its simplest terms
[59:04] oh this isn't algebra it's okay
[59:07] these are what brandon would call the
[59:09] abcs
[59:11] so
[59:12] let me illustrate this
[59:14] literally
[59:15] using
[59:16] art this is a very famous work of art
[59:21] some of you may recognize it
[59:24] most of us would probably scratch our
[59:25] heads and ask what it is and
[59:28] why is this so famous
[59:30] any guesses as to what this is
[59:33] a deathly hush descends no okay well
[59:37] let's step back until we can see the
[59:38] entire picture
[59:42] it's claude monet's bridge over a pond
[59:45] it was painted in 1899.
[59:48] monet was a french artist who started
[59:50] what is known as the impressionist
[59:52] school or impressionism you can see what
[59:54] the objects are
[59:56] but they're not realistic like a
[59:58] snapshot from a camera
[1:00:00] you're left with an impression of how
[1:00:02] the original scene looked that he was
[1:00:04] painting but he was trying to capture
[1:00:05] something of the essence the impression
[1:00:08] the actual scene left on him
[1:00:12] well here's a
[1:00:14] close-up of a portion of the painting
[1:00:17] it's enough detail to get a sense of the
[1:00:19] water lilies and grasses
[1:00:22] the shrubs the water
[1:00:24] the footbridge on a fine spring day to
[1:00:28] clearly see the brush strokes
[1:00:31] and yet still understand how they fit
[1:00:33] into the overall picture the big picture
[1:00:35] if you will
[1:00:36] without being all of the image
[1:00:39] or the
[1:00:40] painting now this particular canvas was
[1:00:43] painted in oils and scholars and critics
[1:00:46] of art have studied monet's methods and
[1:00:48] brush strokes
[1:00:49] pigments and bases other aspects of his
[1:00:52] technique
[1:00:53] there's a lot to learn
[1:00:55] a lot to discuss
[1:00:57] if this is your passion
[1:01:00] but as you look and get closer and
[1:01:02] closer to study the technique
[1:01:05] you can easily lose the picture of what
[1:01:08] is being presented in favor of examining
[1:01:11] how
[1:01:12] it's constructed
[1:01:15] well brother lyle why are you showing us
[1:01:17] a 123 year old painting by a french
[1:01:20] impressionist
[1:01:21] was he a christian is this a scene from
[1:01:23] the bible
[1:01:25] no no it's a scene from part of his
[1:01:27] garden that he planted in france it's
[1:01:29] not from the bible i can't tell if he
[1:01:32] was a christian or not because
[1:01:34] that's not really the point
[1:01:36] let's think about this for a moment
[1:01:39] monet had to apply
[1:01:42] each brushstroke
[1:01:45] each was done by him individually
[1:01:48] carefully
[1:01:49] deliberately with intent but each was to
[1:01:53] contribute to creation of the overall
[1:01:55] painting
[1:01:56] by itself each brush stroke is a glob of
[1:01:59] pigment and suspension in a liquid
[1:02:01] applied on a canvas
[1:02:04] none is very special the specific
[1:02:06] purpose of any particular one by itself
[1:02:09] is
[1:02:10] unclear
[1:02:12] now imagine monet is starting with a
[1:02:14] blank canvas
[1:02:16] he applies the very first brush stroke
[1:02:18] to that canvas
[1:02:21] if you were to observe her in his studio
[1:02:23] at that moment would you have any idea
[1:02:26] what he was doing
[1:02:28] what he was painting it's unlikely that
[1:02:30] you'd be able to visualize the finished
[1:02:32] work in your mind's eye
[1:02:34] after all almost anyone can dip a brush
[1:02:36] into some paint and slap it on some
[1:02:38] canvas
[1:02:39] but not many
[1:02:41] can create a master work of art by doing
[1:02:43] so
[1:02:44] yet this is how the masterwork is
[1:02:46] created
[1:02:48] one brushstroke at a time
[1:02:51] the artist's palette will contain
[1:02:52] various colors they'll be changed over
[1:02:55] time as the work progresses
[1:02:57] he'll thin some and not others
[1:03:02] the artist will typically use silver
[1:03:03] brushes some thin and narrow others more
[1:03:06] broad
[1:03:07] he or she might even use a sort of
[1:03:08] trowel to get a certain effect pressing
[1:03:11] and smearing the paint till it's just
[1:03:12] what he wants it to be
[1:03:15] many brush strokes will overlap others
[1:03:18] some may be several layers as the artist
[1:03:20] seeks to create exactly the image or
[1:03:22] impression he desires in the completed
[1:03:25] work
[1:03:27] the artist
[1:03:28] sees the completed work in his mind's
[1:03:31] eye
[1:03:32] even if the observer seeing only the
[1:03:34] first brushstroke or two cannot
[1:03:37] or even if looking too closely to work
[1:03:39] that's well along or completed just as
[1:03:42] you now see projected on the screen
[1:03:45] it takes time to paint that canvas
[1:03:48] paints must be applied in the correct
[1:03:50] sequence with sufficient time between
[1:03:53] strokes in the same area the colors will
[1:03:55] smear and run together
[1:03:56] otherwise spoil the final work
[1:04:00] as the painting progresses
[1:04:02] the artist may need to adjust something
[1:04:04] tweak modify so the completed work will
[1:04:07] be exactly what he saw in his mind's eye
[1:04:10] before he applied the first bit of paint
[1:04:11] to canvas
[1:04:13] or even
[1:04:14] to his palette
[1:04:16] and when completed
[1:04:18] the art must be viewed in the correct
[1:04:20] light
[1:04:21] anyone beholding the art must also view
[1:04:23] it
[1:04:24] from the proper perspective if you stood
[1:04:26] to the side of this painting or
[1:04:29] behind it
[1:04:30] you wouldn't see it
[1:04:33] and so it is with the bible
[1:04:35] and what
[1:04:36] what we refer to as the message
[1:04:39] god patiently
[1:04:41] over multiple millennia used various
[1:04:43] brushes
[1:04:44] moses
[1:04:46] david
[1:04:46] isaiah jeremiah
[1:04:48] multiple scribes recording israel's
[1:04:50] history
[1:04:52] peter
[1:04:53] paul luke and so forth and these brushes
[1:04:56] applied paints of varying color and
[1:04:58] texture and depth
[1:05:00] psalms
[1:05:01] prophecies
[1:05:03] promises requirements
[1:05:06] history
[1:05:07] fulfillments
[1:05:08] parables
[1:05:10] biographic vignettes some short like
[1:05:12] shamgar in the book of judges
[1:05:14] others quite lengthy like joseph and
[1:05:17] genesis or david and samuel and kings
[1:05:20] and chronicles
[1:05:22] all to create a unified hole
[1:05:25] a big picture
[1:05:27] one picture
[1:05:30] on a recent road trip heather and i
[1:05:31] listened to a series of lectures
[1:05:33] relating the history of the bible
[1:05:35] how the collection of scrolls and other
[1:05:37] writings came to be combined into the
[1:05:39] hebrew or jewish bible the tanakh
[1:05:42] and later the writings that comprise the
[1:05:44] new testament
[1:05:46] some of this history is speculation
[1:05:49] because there are no surviving records
[1:05:50] about how most of this came about
[1:05:53] and there are no surviving what we call
[1:05:55] autographed manuscripts original
[1:05:57] documents
[1:05:59] we don't have moses writings except
[1:06:01] copies of copies of copies of copies the
[1:06:04] earliest being among the dead sea
[1:06:06] scrolls of the oldest of these were
[1:06:08] written some thirteen hundred years
[1:06:10] after moses death
[1:06:13] similarly the most ancient new testament
[1:06:15] manuscripts are from two or three
[1:06:17] centuries after the originals were
[1:06:19] written
[1:06:20] most of the materials from the fourth
[1:06:22] century
[1:06:23] earlier writings are often just
[1:06:25] fragments of papyrus or parchment with
[1:06:28] as little as a verse or two or even just
[1:06:30] a fraction of a single verse
[1:06:33] many are from an early church father
[1:06:35] writing a letter to someone and quoting
[1:06:38] something from
[1:06:40] one of the earlier gospels or earlier
[1:06:42] writings
[1:06:43] and we all know when you
[1:06:45] trying to quote somebody that it's
[1:06:48] sometimes easy to not get it exactly
[1:06:51] right
[1:06:53] the earliest manuscripts do not
[1:06:55] completely agree with each other but
[1:06:58] there are variations sometimes in
[1:07:00] missing or added words
[1:07:02] sometimes spelling sometimes sections of
[1:07:05] writing mark 16 for example has two
[1:07:09] different endings in the oldest known
[1:07:11] manuscripts
[1:07:13] brother branham tells this story about a
[1:07:15] a mother
[1:07:16] her son just graduated from a seminary
[1:07:18] coming home from college
[1:07:20] and about conflicting original new
[1:07:23] testament manuscripts from
[1:07:25] believing god 1952. he says
[1:07:30] the doctor couldn't do nothing for her
[1:07:32] so the young man came up there the
[1:07:33] pastor and prayed for the elderly woman
[1:07:36] and laid his hands on her according to
[1:07:38] james or according to mark 16 they shall
[1:07:41] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:07:42] recover
[1:07:44] he come up and laid his hands upon the
[1:07:46] woman
[1:07:46] a few days she was up and going about
[1:07:49] her work
[1:07:50] as well
[1:07:52] when her son returned home from college
[1:07:54] why he was so happy you know
[1:07:56] he sees his mother so happy and said how
[1:07:58] you've been getting along mother
[1:08:01] said just fine said oh son i forgot to
[1:08:05] tell you something said why he was away
[1:08:07] these four years said i got sick
[1:08:11] and you know mrs over here belongs to
[1:08:13] that full gospel church said her pastor
[1:08:16] come up and laid hands on me according
[1:08:18] to mark 16 and i got well
[1:08:21] said the doctors couldn't do nothing for
[1:08:23] me when i had that sick spell said
[1:08:26] that's how i got well
[1:08:29] he said well mother i want to inform you
[1:08:31] something said of course away to college
[1:08:34] we learned this said the last nine
[1:08:36] verses of mark 16 isn't inspired said
[1:08:39] that was put there by the vatican said
[1:08:42] there's no history that says that that
[1:08:43] word in there was inspired
[1:08:45] and the little woman said praise god
[1:08:48] praise god
[1:08:50] he said what's the matter with you
[1:08:53] mother
[1:08:54] she said if god could heal me with words
[1:08:57] that isn't inspired
[1:08:58] what could he do with them that is
[1:09:00] inspired
[1:09:02] there you are if he could do that with
[1:09:04] uninspired words
[1:09:06] what would he do
[1:09:07] with that that is inspired
[1:09:10] we know that language evolves words and
[1:09:13] their meanings change over time
[1:09:16] cultural context changes we we often
[1:09:18] read the king james version and then
[1:09:20] need a translation from that jacobian
[1:09:22] prose to modern english and sometimes
[1:09:24] even then it's not clear because of the
[1:09:27] context
[1:09:28] not just the definition of the word but
[1:09:30] the cultural context of the word at the
[1:09:32] time that it was used in translating
[1:09:34] from a greek or hebrew or aramaic
[1:09:36] manuscript
[1:09:38] why are you sharing this brother lyle
[1:09:41] well
[1:09:43] let me explain
[1:09:48] we've seen especially over the last 60
[1:09:51] years
[1:09:52] all sorts of so-called revelations
[1:09:55] crop up within the context of our faith
[1:09:58] and what we refer to as the message
[1:10:01] many of these are built on unconnected
[1:10:03] phrases or out of context expressions
[1:10:05] paul warns about this sort of thing in
[1:10:07] his letters to titus and timothy
[1:10:09] now some of you old-timers
[1:10:13] any old-timers here
[1:10:15] uh there's a there's a couple of you
[1:10:17] yeah i look in the mirror in the morning
[1:10:18] and wonder where did that guy come from
[1:10:21] heather who led him in the house but
[1:10:23] then i realized it's me
[1:10:26] well anyway we old timers remember
[1:10:29] before the advent of having sermon
[1:10:32] transcriptions available on personal
[1:10:33] computers or on handheld devices
[1:10:36] we'd be listening to a tape an actual
[1:10:39] physical
[1:10:40] seven inch real real tape maybe some of
[1:10:43] you may not have seen an antique like
[1:10:45] this
[1:10:48] these had the pre-service worship and so
[1:10:50] forth not the truncated digital
[1:10:52] recordings we have today so we could get
[1:10:54] the context
[1:10:55] the service that brother branham was
[1:10:57] speaking in
[1:10:59] well
[1:11:02] sometimes a person would hear that and
[1:11:03] they'd hear something striking
[1:11:06] they'd call it a nugget
[1:11:09] the image was of a person panning for
[1:11:10] gold and finding a small bit of gold in
[1:11:12] their pan
[1:11:14] sadly
[1:11:15] many times the person would leave the
[1:11:17] gold field to carry the analogy and be
[1:11:20] convinced they had found not just a
[1:11:23] nugget
[1:11:24] but the nugget
[1:11:27] and build a doctrine around it and
[1:11:29] gather a following and skew their future
[1:11:32] listening and reading to hear and see
[1:11:34] only those snippets that seem to
[1:11:35] reinforce their interpretation or
[1:11:38] revelation and misignore or explain away
[1:11:43] statements that it appeared to be in
[1:11:44] conflict with their view
[1:11:48] we saw many examples of this
[1:11:50] back in the late 60s i saw brothers
[1:11:53] restoring the large old aircraft they
[1:11:55] told me it was for brother branham to
[1:11:57] use
[1:11:58] might have been a douglas dc four or six
[1:12:00] or an early lockheed constellation i've
[1:12:02] forgotten why were they restoring this
[1:12:04] old airplane
[1:12:06] well they were going to fly brother
[1:12:07] branham around after he rose from the
[1:12:09] grave
[1:12:10] for what they called the return ministry
[1:12:14] two souls you could live any kind of
[1:12:16] life because the soul that sinned would
[1:12:17] die but the predestinated seed had a
[1:12:19] soul that would live forever so you
[1:12:21] could just do any old thing
[1:12:24] or thinking that we're presently in the
[1:12:26] millennium
[1:12:30] back in the mid 60s when my parents
[1:12:32] moved us to tucson to attend the
[1:12:34] tabernacle i remember being in the
[1:12:36] presence of some brothers that are
[1:12:37] mentioned many times in brother
[1:12:39] branham's ministry
[1:12:41] i was in awe of some of these guys one
[1:12:43] of them had a sign on the wall said
[1:12:45] eagles don't flock
[1:12:47] you have to find them one at a time
[1:12:50] this of course explained why they
[1:12:52] refused to attend church
[1:12:54] some of these distortions became quite
[1:12:57] elaborate
[1:12:58] seven thunder's seventh seal
[1:13:00] splitting the laodicean church agent to
[1:13:02] two ages the pentecostal age and the
[1:13:04] bright age therefore needing an eighth
[1:13:06] day messenger which of course was the
[1:13:08] person making the most noise about this
[1:13:12] or declaring brother brandon to be
[1:13:13] infallible that everything that he said
[1:13:16] that was recorded was thus saith the
[1:13:18] lord because or in the days of the voice
[1:13:20] of the seventh angel
[1:13:21] worshiping brother branham or some
[1:13:23] member of his family
[1:13:25] the ministry of the word limited only to
[1:13:27] listening to recordings of brother
[1:13:28] branham
[1:13:30] america turned from god in 1956 so it's
[1:13:32] too late to evangelize her to reach out
[1:13:34] to the lost
[1:13:35] never mind brother branham continued
[1:13:37] doing this until his death in 1965.
[1:13:41] people claiming to be pastors who insist
[1:13:44] the congregation follow their so-called
[1:13:46] revelations claiming they somehow have
[1:13:48] exclusive insight into the truth and
[1:13:50] shun anyone who disagrees
[1:13:54] blasting people because love is
[1:13:56] corrective
[1:13:57] while having none of the attributes of
[1:13:59] love that paul describes in first
[1:14:00] corinthians 13 or that jesus displayed
[1:14:03] throughout his ministry or that brother
[1:14:04] branham displayed
[1:14:06] what's going on
[1:14:08] with all this confusion and
[1:14:10] contradiction
[1:14:12] after all there are many of our precious
[1:14:15] brothers and sisters with whom we will
[1:14:17] spend eternity
[1:14:19] caught up in some of this
[1:14:22] it would appear that those that lead in
[1:14:24] these ways and many of those that follow
[1:14:26] such leadership have lost sight
[1:14:29] of the big picture
[1:14:33] they've lost the context
[1:14:35] promoted their theories or so-called
[1:14:37] revelations as being what is important
[1:14:42] let's take a look for the moment at the
[1:14:43] bible as a document a collection of
[1:14:46] writings just just for a moment
[1:14:49] and the world of biblical scholarship
[1:14:52] those who study the texts and seek to
[1:14:54] put them in context or to search for
[1:14:56] original text or try to reconstruct the
[1:14:59] elusive source documents
[1:15:02] there are new testament bibles written
[1:15:03] in greek that incorporate all of the
[1:15:06] known texts from the various codices
[1:15:10] the page projected here is uh matthew 1
[1:15:13] 23-2-7 and it's in greek and it's very
[1:15:16] hard for you to see but it doesn't
[1:15:18] matter because i can't read it either
[1:15:21] but you'll find on these things that
[1:15:22] there'll be a passage
[1:15:24] and then there's footnotes to
[1:15:26] include all the known variations in that
[1:15:28] passage with letters indicating which
[1:15:30] ancient codex contains which variation
[1:15:34] some will be marked as all ancient
[1:15:36] documents say this exactly this way it
[1:15:38] can be relied upon
[1:15:41] some will be marked at the majority of
[1:15:42] the text read this way but a small
[1:15:44] number read this other way
[1:15:48] some sections say
[1:15:50] every one of them is a little bit
[1:15:52] different here and there's not much
[1:15:53] agreement on which one might be right so
[1:15:56] take your pick
[1:15:59] so i've tried to show the big picture
[1:16:01] with the body of text
[1:16:03] and focusing on the brush strokes is all
[1:16:05] of these footnotes here
[1:16:08] it's easy to get into a discussion about
[1:16:10] these things
[1:16:12] but such discussions often devolve into
[1:16:14] arguments
[1:16:15] and people can build doctrines
[1:16:17] that's a code word sometimes for fences
[1:16:20] around a particular variant
[1:16:23] and that's when you have to step back
[1:16:25] and stop focusing on a particular brush
[1:16:28] stroke or pigment choice or greek letter
[1:16:30] or word
[1:16:32] or message quote
[1:16:33] and look at the big picture
[1:16:36] for example there are variations in
[1:16:38] these manuscripts of the words ascribed
[1:16:40] to jesus in the sermon on the mount
[1:16:44] now all of these are written in greek
[1:16:45] and jesus didn't speak greek
[1:16:47] but the language of the text but jesus
[1:16:50] spoke aramaic a kind of a common man's
[1:16:52] hebrew but the point
[1:16:54] the big picture view is that none of the
[1:16:57] texts say blessed are the warmongers for
[1:17:00] they shall be called the sons of god
[1:17:02] they all say blessed are the peacemakers
[1:17:06] for they shall be called the children of
[1:17:08] god
[1:17:10] it's the big picture
[1:17:12] in the transcripts of brother branham
[1:17:13] sermons i can show you where he said
[1:17:15] moses wife was named sarah
[1:17:17] conference with god 1960 paragraph 22.
[1:17:20] from the context we know he meant
[1:17:22] abraham
[1:17:24] the whole thing is about abraham but he
[1:17:26] used he said moses
[1:17:28] now it's recorded
[1:17:30] and the holy spirit didn't interrupt him
[1:17:32] and say oh go back i said that wrong i
[1:17:34] should have said abraham i'm sorry no
[1:17:36] that didn't happen
[1:17:37] no
[1:17:38] so if one holds it brother branham was
[1:17:40] somehow infallible in the recorded
[1:17:42] messages we have then you're stuck with
[1:17:44] creating a doctrine
[1:17:46] and claimed that moses had two wives or
[1:17:48] zipporah was a wound with a spirit of
[1:17:50] sarah or some other way to explain
[1:17:53] around this to hold on to this concept
[1:17:55] of infallibility
[1:17:57] and completely
[1:18:04] i'm sorry
[1:18:07] we must allow
[1:18:08] william branham to be a prophet
[1:18:11] as well as a human
[1:18:13] a human who plainly declared my words
[1:18:15] will fail
[1:18:17] not to instead try to make him more than
[1:18:19] a prophet or more than a man
[1:18:21] some go to the extreme of making him a
[1:18:23] god and worship him and pray to him and
[1:18:25] baptize in his name
[1:18:27] completely losing sight of the big
[1:18:29] picture
[1:18:30] the whole purpose of his ministry was to
[1:18:32] point us back
[1:18:34] to jesus and the faith of the
[1:18:36] spirit-filled early church
[1:18:39] not to replace either one
[1:18:42] any revelation or teaching or doctrine
[1:18:45] we're told has to track from genesis 1 1
[1:18:48] to revelation 22 21 not from faith is a
[1:18:52] substance 1947 to communion 1965.
[1:18:56] the bible is a standard we must use to
[1:18:58] measure and judge all things spiritual
[1:19:01] while depending on the holy spirit to
[1:19:03] correctly interpret it to us giving us
[1:19:04] wisdom how to apply it in every
[1:19:06] circumstance and the message is a guide
[1:19:08] into that
[1:19:10] malachi 4 5 tells us the mission of the
[1:19:14] elijah ministry in our day was to turn
[1:19:16] us back to the faith of the fathers
[1:19:19] the early church not to replace it or
[1:19:22] its teachings was something new
[1:19:25] brother greene used to tell us he liked
[1:19:27] the german translation to correct those
[1:19:29] things that have gone off into error
[1:19:31] which clearly implies that not
[1:19:32] everything went off into error
[1:19:35] the mission
[1:19:36] was not to replace the bible with a
[1:19:38] church age book
[1:19:40] or a book of mormon
[1:19:43] or a collection of quotes
[1:19:45] it was not to replace a pope
[1:19:47] with a prophet or the ministry
[1:19:50] with recordings or the bible
[1:19:53] with quotes
[1:19:54] or the holy spirit
[1:19:56] with a computer
[1:19:58] here's a quote from a prophet about the
[1:20:01] ministry
[1:20:02] and the days of the tape recorder 1950
[1:20:05] prodigal
[1:20:07] i'm so thankful for the
[1:20:09] tape recorders no
[1:20:11] i'm so thankful for the ministers here
[1:20:13] and them that sing that kind of inspired
[1:20:16] or help them
[1:20:17] help them along
[1:20:18] that's the purpose of being here is
[1:20:20] trying to help others
[1:20:23] brother branham's purpose in holding
[1:20:25] this meeting was to help not replace the
[1:20:27] local ministry and the local people
[1:20:30] and bring the loss to salvation to share
[1:20:33] the gift of healing he was commissioned
[1:20:35] to bring
[1:20:36] he says we i could never take the
[1:20:38] message to all the world myself
[1:20:41] the message he was commissioned to bring
[1:20:43] it's going to take thousands of tape
[1:20:46] recorders and books
[1:20:48] computers
[1:20:50] iphones
[1:20:51] no it will take thousands of us
[1:20:53] ministers of the gospel together to do
[1:20:56] this and together when we can unite
[1:20:59] ourselves it takes work that must be
[1:21:01] done by ministers in unity
[1:21:04] forgetting about listen closely what he
[1:21:07] says forgetting about our churches
[1:21:10] forgetting about our doctrines
[1:21:12] fences walls that separate and so forth
[1:21:15] to just know this one thing
[1:21:19] the message
[1:21:20] just to know this one thing christ and
[1:21:22] him crucified and know that among us
[1:21:26] the living christ
[1:21:29] and i think that god will fix him to do
[1:21:31] a marvelous work right away i believe
[1:21:33] we're going to see the moving of the
[1:21:34] spirit like we've never seen in all the
[1:21:36] ages
[1:21:37] the holy spirit the spirit of christ
[1:21:42] and of course
[1:21:43] we're always hearing about this term
[1:21:45] this phrase the word in the context of
[1:21:48] what we call the message people use that
[1:21:50] phrase
[1:21:51] often referring to recorded sermons the
[1:21:54] word of the hour it's not a bad thing
[1:21:56] not at all it's a very good thing but we
[1:21:58] must be really really
[1:22:01] careful
[1:22:02] too often we're encouraged by some that
[1:22:04] the moving of the spirit was in the 20th
[1:22:06] century
[1:22:08] pentecost or that it was only in brother
[1:22:11] branham that we've moved on we're beyond
[1:22:14] the outpouring of the spirit living in
[1:22:16] the body of christ
[1:22:17] we're in the bright age or the word age
[1:22:20] here's testimony from brother branham my
[1:22:22] commission 1951
[1:22:25] so then later on it would come to me
[1:22:28] he's talking about these experiences
[1:22:30] that he had would speak to me tell me
[1:22:32] things that were going to happen
[1:22:33] well i stayed away from it
[1:22:36] after my conversion my own church in the
[1:22:38] baptist church i took it up with some of
[1:22:40] the ministers and so forth and they
[1:22:42] advised me to stay away from it never
[1:22:44] have nothing to do that it's wrong
[1:22:46] if anything comes to you said we them
[1:22:48] days of the supernatural that's on the
[1:22:50] other side said we live by the word
[1:22:54] how similar that sounds to what we often
[1:22:56] hear today
[1:22:58] the supernatural wizard brother
[1:22:59] branham's ministry we've moved beyond it
[1:23:01] it was for the pentecostal age we're
[1:23:03] living in the bright age
[1:23:06] phrases often times for saying the days
[1:23:08] of miracles are passed it was it ended
[1:23:11] in 1965. well brother branham goes on to
[1:23:14] say
[1:23:15] and i read one day where the letter
[1:23:17] kills
[1:23:18] but the spirit gives life
[1:23:21] we read that scripture during our
[1:23:22] opening this evening so i tried to push
[1:23:24] away i recognized it sat down tried to
[1:23:26] consider it just in the best way that i
[1:23:28] could
[1:23:31] we speak sometimes of the mechanics
[1:23:33] meaning the word knowledge wisdom
[1:23:35] understanding
[1:23:36] and the dynamics the spirit the life
[1:23:40] and they need to come together
[1:23:42] we need both
[1:23:44] the message was to show jesus christ the
[1:23:48] signs on the back of the building here
[1:23:50] the same yesterday and today and forever
[1:23:55] not just in the life and ministry of our
[1:23:57] precious brother william branham
[1:24:00] in each of us we each need that same
[1:24:03] jesus christ that same spirit in our
[1:24:05] lives
[1:24:06] and that the god mentioned in genesis 1
[1:24:09] that created our universe
[1:24:11] is the same as a persian mentioned
[1:24:13] in saint john 1.
[1:24:16] there's another lesson about our
[1:24:17] christian walk we can learn from
[1:24:19] studying monet's masterpiece the big
[1:24:21] picture individual brush strokes i'm
[1:24:23] sure you've already seen it
[1:24:25] and that's that we are one body
[1:24:27] one masterpiece yet many members many
[1:24:30] brush strokes and pigments and so forth
[1:24:32] each of which
[1:24:34] is essential
[1:24:35] only work together in harmony to achieve
[1:24:38] our common goal can we find the meaning
[1:24:40] and fulfill god's purpose for our lives
[1:24:42] individually and as a church
[1:24:46] well
[1:24:47] in light of all this
[1:24:50] how would you answer
[1:24:51] this question
[1:24:53] teach me the message brought by brother
[1:24:55] william branham
[1:24:57] while i stand
[1:24:58] on one foot
[1:25:02] could be as simple as jesus is lord
[1:25:05] but that could lack context in our
[1:25:08] present time a possible response
[1:25:11] love god with all your heart soul mind
[1:25:14] and strength while treating others as
[1:25:16] you wish to be treated
[1:25:18] jesus christ is lord and is the same
[1:25:20] yesterday and today and forever
[1:25:22] the rest is commentary
[1:25:24] so go study read your bible pray listen
[1:25:28] with understanding
[1:25:30] there are other valid responses of
[1:25:32] course and you can probably condense it
[1:25:34] better than this poor example
[1:25:36] musicians would please come back i'd
[1:25:39] like to close tonight
[1:25:41] rereading mark
[1:25:43] 12 30.
[1:25:47] thou shalt love have agapo affection for
[1:25:51] the lord thy god
[1:25:53] with all thy heart
[1:25:54] thoughts feelings with all thy soul
[1:25:58] life
[1:25:59] breath
[1:26:00] with all thy mind understanding and with
[1:26:03] all thy strength
[1:26:05] forcefulness might ability
[1:26:08] this is the first
[1:26:10] the most important
[1:26:11] the greatest commandment the words of
[1:26:14] jesus
[1:26:16] but you know what
[1:26:18] we can read that but let's sing it
[1:26:21] we can sing it together there's a song
[1:26:23] based on this verse as part of our
[1:26:25] standing on one foot response as brother
[1:26:28] aaron comes to close the service

[1:29:14] from
[1:29:15] the dead
[1:29:17] and he is lord
[1:29:20] [Music]

[1:29:39] christ
[1:29:41] is lord one more time
[1:29:43] [Music]
[1:29:45] oh he
[1:29:47] is lord
[1:29:51] he
[1:29:52] is lonely
[1:29:57] he has risen
[1:30:00] from
[1:30:01] the dead
[1:30:02] and he
[1:30:04] is lord
[1:30:08] every knee
[1:30:11] shall
[1:30:12] bow
[1:30:14] every tongue
[1:30:18] confess that
[1:30:23] jesus christ
[1:30:26] is lord
[1:30:27] [Music]
[1:30:29] see he was the one that rose from the
[1:30:32] dead and and every tongue has to confess
[1:30:36] that
[1:30:37] i want to be willing to say he's my lord
[1:30:41] and and
[1:30:42] if you catch and that's the holy spirit
[1:30:44] that's christ himself dwell in you and
[1:30:47] he is the interpreter of the word he's
[1:30:48] the one that wrote the book
[1:30:51] he's the one that shows you what it is i
[1:30:53] as brother i was speaking i just
[1:30:55] remembered some experiences
[1:30:58] in life of how
[1:31:00] how i reacted to certain things that
[1:31:02] happened
[1:31:05] i was asking two brothers fine brothers
[1:31:07] and
[1:31:08] i made this question to whom i asked him
[1:31:10] i said
[1:31:12] if god be with us then where are the
[1:31:14] miracles
[1:31:16] and they both answered me and said
[1:31:18] brother we are so far in the word today
[1:31:21] we don't need those things
[1:31:25] and it always puzzled me how could you
[1:31:27] say that if jesus christ is the same
[1:31:29] yesterday today and forever
[1:31:32] i always pondered that
[1:31:35] another time talking with a brother and
[1:31:37] [Music]
[1:31:38] he was
[1:31:39] just talking he had his hands raised up
[1:31:41] in the air his eyes up
[1:31:44] and he was saying things that just
[1:31:46] didn't make a whole lot of sense
[1:31:49] and he turned around and looked at me
[1:31:51] and he said what do you think of that
[1:31:52] brother
[1:31:55] and
[1:31:56] i
[1:31:57] just said the first thing
[1:31:59] that came to mind i said personally i
[1:32:01] think you're nuts
[1:32:03] and i walked away i i i feel bad about
[1:32:06] that i never should have said that but
[1:32:07] it's just how it struck me
[1:32:13] but it's christ in us
[1:32:16] who can take this word
[1:32:19] and this message that we do believe
[1:32:22] and make it live in us
[1:32:24] we can be an example of jesus christ to
[1:32:27] others
[1:32:29] the same one that said
[1:32:32] woman where are they in accusers
[1:32:35] and she said they are gone he said
[1:32:36] neither do i condemn thee neither do i
[1:32:38] accuse thee
[1:32:41] the same one that looked at peter when
[1:32:43] peter said what he said and he said
[1:32:45] satan get behind me see he wasn't
[1:32:47] looking at peter he was looking at the
[1:32:48] motive in the spirit
[1:32:50] and he's the one that checks our hearts
[1:32:52] for us
[1:32:53] i said this is what
[1:32:55] if you would have sat down with monet
[1:32:57] and and watched and paid and asked him
[1:32:59] questions he might be able to tell you
[1:33:01] this is what i'm trying to express this
[1:33:03] is what i'm trying to do
[1:33:05] and that's what the spirit of christ
[1:33:06] does in us
[1:33:08] and that same mercy and grace has been
[1:33:10] extended to me i want it extended to
[1:33:13] each and every one of us today
[1:33:16] let's stand
[1:33:18] just thinking of their words but they
[1:33:20] didn't remember all the song because if
[1:33:22] he is not lord of everything
[1:33:24] then he's not loaded lord at all so
[1:33:28] lord i surrender all let's pray lord
[1:33:30] jesus
[1:33:32] we've been
[1:33:34] we've been here many years now and
[1:33:38] there's just a few left there were were
[1:33:40] still that were born around the time or
[1:33:42] were still living when brother branham
[1:33:45] was here on earth lord but
[1:33:47] you took your servant home because you
[1:33:49] were done with him lord
[1:33:52] but you gave us a promise that you would
[1:33:53] fill us with the holy spirit you would
[1:33:55] fill us with the holy ghost lord and
[1:33:57] that would be our keeper that would be
[1:33:59] our guide
[1:34:00] that would teach us how
[1:34:02] to love one another how to encourage one
[1:34:05] another
[1:34:06] lord and that's christ in us the hope of
[1:34:08] glory lord
[1:34:10] today right even in our own city
[1:34:12] sometimes lord there's not a lot of
[1:34:14] fellowship and not a lot of harmony just
[1:34:16] simply because of the different beliefs
[1:34:19] lord
[1:34:20] but we all claim to believe the same
[1:34:22] lord jesus christ lord
[1:34:25] let god be manifested in us
[1:34:28] let others say truly
[1:34:30] there's a christian which means they are
[1:34:32] christ-like lord
[1:34:34] that's our desire today lord and may we
[1:34:36] spend time with you
[1:34:39] may we read your word may we talk with
[1:34:41] you may we bathe in your presence lord
[1:34:44] so we could we could catch the full
[1:34:47] essence the full mealing of what you
[1:34:49] desire today lord is our prayer
[1:34:52] in jesus christ's name
[1:34:54] amen
[1:34:57] let the brother tell me that we were in
[1:34:59] the millennium now
[1:35:02] and that
[1:35:05] when jesus said if you open up the your
[1:35:07] heart and i enter in
[1:35:10] that's communion so that we don't take
[1:35:12] communion anymore
[1:35:14] and he gave me this long thing about
[1:35:16] where we are at today
[1:35:20] and just
[1:35:21] asked him a question i thought there
[1:35:22] would be a body change though
[1:35:26] i said and he goes
[1:35:28] he looked at me i said because you're
[1:35:30] getting up in age
[1:35:32] and if we're in the millennium now how
[1:35:34] old are you going to be in the
[1:35:36] millennium
[1:35:39] i said 100 200 300 400 years old
[1:35:44] he just put his head down he says
[1:35:47] well i guess eventually there has to be
[1:35:49] a body change
[1:35:51] and i said yes that's what we're all
[1:35:52] looking for
[1:35:54] and i say even so come quickly lord
[1:35:56] jesus amen
[1:35:58] amen yes he
