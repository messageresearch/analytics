[1:47] you in service.
[1:48] We uh what we do on Wednesday night is
[1:52] we have a Wednesday night Bible study
[1:55] where I like to go through read a lot
[1:58] from the Bible and just teach. And the
[2:03] Bible's so it's so good. I mean, a lot
[2:05] of times it just teaches itself. All you
[2:06] have to do is just read it and then it's
[2:09] just like, wow, this is just amazing.
[2:12] What I've been doing is going through
[2:14] the life and I would like to finish up
[2:16] tonight going up through the life of
[2:19] this man, King Saul. He was the first
[2:23] king of Israel. And
[2:27] what is it?
[2:30] Have Have you all enjoyed this with this
[2:33] King Saul? Have what is it about him
[2:37] that that's really touched you
[2:40] in in learning about him? Do you have
[2:42] you learned anything about him
[2:44] &gt;&gt; that has helped?
[2:46] &gt;&gt; But uh brother Silas, what have you
[2:47] learned from him?
[2:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Silas said he's seen some of his
[2:54] faults. To me, this man Saul is a very
[2:57] relatable character. Wow. I see a lot of
[3:00] my own weaknesses and other people's
[3:02] weaknesses in this man. He do you
[3:05] remember what tribe he was from?
[3:08] &gt;&gt; Benjamin.
[3:09] &gt;&gt; Benjamin. Yeah. Came from really what
[3:11] Saul called really the most humble
[3:13] tribe. It was a small tribe of the 12
[3:15] tribes of Israel.
[3:17] And Saul was he was a very kingly
[3:22] looking man. He was taller than
[3:24] everybody else. good-looking guy,
[3:27] wellspoken,
[3:29] and he was he started out good. The the
[3:32] people of Israel wanted somebody to lead
[3:34] him into battle after Samuel Samuel was
[3:38] getting old and they saw that his
[3:40] offspring, they weren't anywhere close
[3:43] to the character that Samuel the prophet
[3:45] was. Samuel the prophet was the last in
[3:47] the line of judges and uh and one of the
[3:50] greatest prophets that's in the entire
[3:52] Bible led the uh the people of Israel
[3:56] really led them very wisely
[3:59] and he was getting old. His children
[4:01] weren't the character that that Samuel
[4:04] was. So the people of Israel wanted a
[4:08] king. They saw all the other nations out
[4:10] there and they said that they were
[4:13] afraid of the Philistines and the
[4:14] Amalachites and the Amorites and all
[4:16] these ones that were around that would
[4:18] have loved to have their land. They
[4:20] wanted someone to lead them into battle.
[4:23] And who better than this big giant
[4:26] broadshouldered man named Saul. He was
[4:29] exactly what they wanted.
[4:32] But God wanted really he wanted the
[4:35] people he God wanted the people to rely
[4:37] on him
[4:38] &gt;&gt; and not on someone else not on a man but
[4:41] he wanted the people to pray and he
[4:44] wanted the people to
[4:46] trust in the Lord and have faith in the
[4:48] Lord. But he gave them like so often God
[4:51] gives us what we want many times even if
[4:55] it's not what we need. And that's that's
[4:58] what happened with this man. Although he
[5:00] was the the greatest and he was God's
[5:04] choice for king,
[5:06] Samuel the prophet, God sent Samuel to
[5:08] anoint him and uh he became king and the
[5:12] people were very happy. They were very
[5:14] proud of Saul. And Saul started out
[5:16] really well, very brave in battle. He
[5:20] was able to actually unify all of the 12
[5:23] tribes together for the first time and
[5:26] they went they went to battle and and
[5:28] they won their battle and Saul showed
[5:30] all the way up until he died. Saul
[5:33] showed that he is a was a great military
[5:36] leader and he he just he he started out
[5:41] he had compassion on the people. He had
[5:44] wisdom.
[5:45] He was, the Bible says, and this is very
[5:48] important, he was small in his own
[5:52] sight.
[5:54] And when Saul began to lose that is when
[5:59] Saul began to fail.
[6:02] But but Samuel tells him, he said, 'You
[6:04] were great when you were little in your
[6:06] own sight, but now you're starting to
[6:10] develop these bad traits.
[6:15] So Saul made some hasty decisions, made
[6:18] made quite a few mistakes, and brother
[6:20] Silas, that's where I see myself. It's
[6:22] like these were some of the easiest
[6:24] decisions
[6:25] that to make a mistake on. and Saul made
[6:29] made the mistakes and really the straw
[6:32] that broke the camel's back
[6:35] was
[6:37] when God tells Samuel to tell Saul to go
[6:44] to to make ready for this battle. But
[6:47] before they go to battle often they
[6:49] would make a sacrifice to God. So Saul
[6:52] tell or Samuel tells Saul he says listen
[6:55] I'm going to come before you go to
[6:58] battle with the Amalachites I'm going to
[7:01] come I am going to make the sacrifice
[7:06] wait for me
[7:09] and
[7:11] when you go you kill every man woman
[7:16] child donkey
[7:19] everything.
[7:21] Kill every last thing and and leave
[7:26] nothing alive.
[7:28] So Saul,
[7:31] they made ready for the battle and I
[7:34] believe it was seven days and seven days
[7:36] came and seven days went and the prophet
[7:39] Samuel didn't show up. So Saul says,
[7:44] "Well, what I'll do, we got to make a
[7:45] sacrifice we before we go to battle. So
[7:47] what I'll do is I will just make the
[7:50] sacrifice and then we will go to battle.
[7:53] So as so Saul makes the sacrifice and
[7:57] and they they they mess up there and
[8:00] Saul ends up not killing
[8:03] all of these Amalachites.
[8:07] Samuel shows up
[8:09] and
[8:11] he says, "What's the sound of these
[8:15] sheep I hear?"
[8:17] And Saul's like, "Oh, well, here's what
[8:19] happened. The people wanted to keep some
[8:21] of the livestock, some of the good ones.
[8:23] We killed all the people, most of the
[8:24] people. And we killed all the livestock,
[8:27] most of the livestock, but we just kept
[8:30] the good ones to make sacrifices."
[8:32] And Samuel said, 'No, I told God told
[8:35] you to kill every single one.' And he
[8:39] said, 'Well,
[8:41] we didn't. And what probably happened is
[8:45] Saul felt the pressure from the people
[8:49] so they could keep some of the
[8:50] livestock, some of the good livestock.
[8:52] And then Saul did not kill this
[8:54] Amalachite king named Aag.
[8:59] And Samuel ends up doing what God said,
[9:03] killing all of the people, killing all
[9:07] the livestock, and then killing this man
[9:10] Aag. And that was really the last straw.
[9:16] And let's let's read it. 1st Samuel
[9:20] chapter 15
[9:23] verse number three. And it says this 1st
[9:28] Samuel
[9:30] 15. Yeah. Verse three.
[9:38] There we go.
[9:41] Now go and smite Amalcch, the
[9:43] Amalachites, and utterly destroy all
[9:46] that they have, and spare them not, but
[9:49] slay both man and woman, infant and
[9:52] suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
[9:56] So Saul killed most most of the people
[9:58] and he did mostly what God said, but he
[10:02] did not finish the job as I said. And
[10:05] then 1st Samuel 15 ends like this. And
[10:08] we talked about this in the in the last
[10:10] Bible study on Saul. And Samuel came no
[10:13] more to see Saul until the day of his
[10:16] death. Nevertheless, Samuel mourned for
[10:19] Saul. And the Lord repented that he had
[10:22] made Saul king over Israel. It's 1st
[10:27] Samuel 15:35.
[10:30] Now God's focus turned from this king
[10:32] Saul.
[10:34] turned to this young man, the son of of
[10:36] Jesse named David. We won't spend much
[10:39] time on this because
[10:41] Lyle focused on David and and I am
[10:44] focusing on Saul.
[10:46] But it uh the Lord starts to turn his
[10:50] eyes towards David. And let's read what
[10:54] happens here as as Samuel anoints David
[10:58] because I think it's important for Saul.
[11:00] Let's go to chapter 16 verse number one.
[11:03] And the Lord said unto Samuel, "How long
[11:06] will thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have
[11:08] rejected him from reigning over Israel?
[11:11] Fill thine horn with oil, and go. I will
[11:15] send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for
[11:18] I have provided me a king among his
[11:21] sons." And Samuel said, "How can I go?
[11:25] If Saul hear it, he will kill me." And
[11:27] the Lord said, "Take a hepher with thee
[11:29] and say, I have I am come to sacrifice
[11:32] the Lord." You know, I read this and how
[11:36] many times have I read the Bible and
[11:38] being been very surprised at how God
[11:42] handles the situation?
[11:44] So, he tells Samuel, he says, "Go and
[11:48] anoint this this son of Jesse." And then
[11:52] Samuel's like, "But wait a minute, Lord.
[11:55] if I go, Saul will know that I'm up to
[11:58] something that he doesn't want me to do
[12:01] and he's going to kill me. So,
[12:06] you would just think that God would say,
[12:07] "Well, just go. I'll protect you."
[12:10] But he doesn't say that. He says, "No."
[12:12] He says, "Go and take a calf, a cow, and
[12:17] go like you're going to make a sacrifice
[12:20] and that you're going to get Jesse to to
[12:23] sacrifice with you." God doesn't say do
[12:27] do things like we think he should do
[12:28] him,
[12:29] &gt;&gt; you know. But he did protect Samuel
[12:32] &gt;&gt; and he said, "Now go like this and make
[12:35] this sacrifice." And then if Saul sees
[12:38] you going, it's like, "Oh, he's a
[12:39] priest. He's doing his thing. He's just
[12:41] going and making the sacrifice. So then
[12:43] he goes, but one thing here that you
[12:47] don't see in the scriptures until this
[12:49] point, and that is Samuel now has a fear
[12:55] of Saul. So something is happening that
[12:59] isn't written in the Bible that Samuel
[13:02] sees and he sees this change in this man
[13:07] Saul to where now he has become
[13:10] dangerous and he says if I go Saul's
[13:14] going to kill me which is something we
[13:17] haven't seen yet but now we are starting
[13:19] to see this spirit rise up in this King
[13:24] Saul and there's really the first hint
[13:27] that we have that I've seen in the
[13:29] scriptures.
[13:31] So, let's keep going. Let's go to um
[13:34] let's read verse number two again. And
[13:37] Samuel said, "How can I go if Saul Saul
[13:40] hear it? They he will kill me." And the
[13:44] Lord said, "Take a heer with thee, and
[13:46] say, I am come to sacrifice to the Lord,
[13:51] and call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I
[13:54] will show thee what thou shalt do, and
[13:56] thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I
[14:00] name unto thee." Again, he doesn't tell
[14:02] his prophet who to anoint. He just goes
[14:05] and says, "It's going to be one of these
[14:06] sons of this man, Jesse."
[14:10] And Samuel did that which the Lord spake
[14:13] and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of
[14:15] the town trembled at his coming and
[14:18] said, "Comest thou peaceibly."
[14:21] And he said peaceibly again. So we see
[14:25] this top man in the whole country coming
[14:29] to this town and they're like, "Uhoh,
[14:33] Samuel's coming.
[14:36] Is Is there something wrong? Are we all
[14:38] going to die? Is Saul mad? What's going
[14:40] on? And Samuel's like, "No, I come
[14:42] peaceably. I come to sacrifice unto the
[14:45] Lord." Remember what the Lord told him
[14:47] to bring the hepher? Sanctify yourselves
[14:50] and come with me to the sacrifice. And
[14:53] he sanctified Jesse and his sons and
[14:55] called them to the sacrifice. Now, the
[14:58] prophet goes through
[15:00] seven of Jesse's sons from the
[15:04] bestlooking and the most kingly all the
[15:07] way down to one that wasn't even there.
[15:11] Let's let's go to verse number 11 for
[15:13] time's sake.
[15:15] So, he goes through all these seven sons
[15:17] and it's like, "Wow, this one looks
[15:18] great. Lord didn't want him." And then
[15:20] he goes all the way down. And Samuel
[15:22] said to Jesse,
[15:24] "Are here all thy children?"
[15:27] And he said, "There remainth yet one,
[15:30] the young, yet the youngest, and behold,
[15:32] he keepeth a sheep." And Samuel said
[15:34] unto Jesse, "Send and fetch him, for we
[15:37] will not sit down until he comes."
[15:41] And he sent and brought him in. Now he
[15:44] was ruddy. And with all of a beautiful
[15:46] countenance, you know what ruddy means?
[15:49] means like red complexed. Yeah. Means
[15:52] like lighter like a pinkish complexion
[15:56] and uh
[15:59] so he he brings him in
[16:02] and now he was ready and with all
[16:04] beautiful countenance and goodly to look
[16:06] at. So David was a nicel looking young
[16:08] man. And the Lord said, "Arise and
[16:10] anoint him for this is he." And Samuel
[16:13] took the horn of oil and anointed him in
[16:15] the midst of his brethren. And the
[16:17] spirit of the Lord came upon David for
[16:19] that from that day forward. So Samuel
[16:22] rose up and went to Rama. So this is a
[16:26] amazing moment right here. From this
[16:28] time the young man David had the spirit
[16:31] of the Lord upon him. And about the same
[16:34] time the opposite happened to King Saul.
[16:38] We'll get to we'll get to that in a
[16:40] moment. So Saul, we we saw that hint
[16:45] that Samuel said, "Well, he's going to
[16:46] kill me." So we see that there's some
[16:49] sort of a jealousy in this man Saul
[16:53] because and then we're going to see it
[16:56] as we go through the the rest of First
[16:58] Samuel that this jealousy just overtook
[17:02] Saul. And if you this jealousy, friends,
[17:06] that's a it's a hard spirit. When when
[17:09] someone has that spirit of jealousy,
[17:11] let's say they have a a jealous spirit
[17:13] for their husband or for their wife,
[17:15] they don't trust their husband or their
[17:17] wife, and they start to fight. They
[17:20] start to argue. And what it does is that
[17:23] jealousy then produces a a strife in the
[17:28] family. Or it could be between friends.
[17:30] they're they're jealous of of somebody
[17:32] getting more attention or whatever it is
[17:34] that spirit comes in and it causes
[17:37] division and then it compounds what if
[17:40] there was a small problem at the
[17:42] beginning then it makes that problem a
[17:44] lot worse and then that jealousy could
[17:47] actually bring to pass the greatest fear
[17:49] that the person has.
[17:51] So, you see how the enemy gets in here
[17:53] and pretty soon I'm going to answer this
[17:55] question about how an evil spirit came
[17:58] from God. And we'll see how this evil
[18:02] spirit can come in and just do all kinds
[18:04] of damage.
[18:06] So, we see the biggest problem with with
[18:10] all of this so far is not Saul's
[18:13] mistakes, but he's going to allow this
[18:16] spirit that's been troubling him to take
[18:18] root and dominate his life.
[18:21] We hear about complexes and we hear
[18:24] about people we know people that really
[18:26] just struggle with just relationship
[18:29] relationships and that when you finally
[18:32] give into that spirit that causes that
[18:34] problem then your problems just multiply
[18:37] and get really bad. But if you can
[18:40] overcome that spirit,
[18:43] &gt;&gt; then you see that even though it's it's
[18:45] very hard sometimes, you see that that
[18:47] spirit will leave and then things will
[18:51] things will get better. And and this is
[18:53] very very evident, very evident in this
[18:55] very relatable character called Saul.
[18:59] So what Saul does, he allows this evil
[19:01] spirit to come in. He took the easy way.
[19:05] And isn't it strange that the easy way
[19:09] is always to give in to temper,
[19:15] to give in to jealousy, to give in to
[19:18] rage, to give in to gossip? Why is it
[19:23] that those are It's so easy to do that,
[19:27] but it's so hard to overcome it.
[19:32] But overcoming it is the right thing to
[19:34] do. I quote Revelation chapter 2 and
[19:37] three often. To him that overcomes
[19:41] will I give the gift of the age. It's
[19:44] the harder thing. And this is the thing
[19:45] that you will see that Saul did not do.
[19:48] He he just didn't battle it. He didn't
[19:51] overcome it. He gave in to the spirit.
[19:54] When we stop resisting and give into
[19:56] that spirit, then that spirit enters our
[19:58] lives and then it ruins our lives. It
[20:02] can ruin a relationship. It just ruins
[20:04] everything when we give in. And we
[20:08] should know it. When you have that bad
[20:10] feeling, that angry feeling or whatever
[20:13] our weaknesses, we all have them. When
[20:16] that spirit starts to come in and we
[20:18] allow it in, that's when we lose. Amen.
[20:22] &gt;&gt; But when we fight it,
[20:24] &gt;&gt; we can we can become victorious. James
[20:26] 4:7 says, "Resist the devil and he will
[20:29] flee from you."
[20:33] &gt;&gt; Saul no longer does this as we'll soon
[20:36] find out and misery just enters into his
[20:39] life.
[20:41] So again, there's no happiness in an
[20:43] evil spirit even though it's so easy to
[20:45] give into it. Jealousy, lust so common
[20:50] in today, hatred, resentment, critical
[20:54] natures that just criticizes everything.
[20:59] Those friends, that's not happiness.
[21:02] Even though it's so easy to give into
[21:04] that spirit, it's not happiness. If you
[21:08] overcome that spirit, then you will see
[21:12] joy will enter in. My my grandma, she's
[21:14] 98 years old. She just died. She's
[21:16] almost 99. We're going to um have her
[21:20] funeral on Friday.
[21:22] I never heard my grandma and I've known
[21:26] her for 54 years and one month.
[21:30] And I have never heard my grandma say a
[21:33] negative word about anyone.
[21:35] &gt;&gt; 98 years old.
[21:38] Never a bad word about anyone. And you
[21:41] know what? She was the happiest person
[21:43] that I think I've ever met. And tell me
[21:46] this. Was happiness because she overcame
[21:50] or did she never say a bad word about
[21:52] anyone because she was happy? I think
[21:54] it's because she overcame.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; I remember grandpa I was fishing with
[21:59] grandma and grandpa and we were coming
[22:02] home from Roosevelt Lake and we stopped
[22:04] at McDonald's and we uh grandpa liked
[22:08] the filt of fish at McDonald's. My
[22:10] grandpa's a big guy, you know, he's like
[22:12] 6'4. Um,
[22:15] and you know, you got to feed the
[22:17] machine. So, we get there and grandpa
[22:20] likes the filt of fish and he orders it
[22:23] and we order, me and grandma order ours.
[22:25] And grandpa gets this little tiny thing,
[22:29] that big. And there's my big old grandpa
[22:32] with his big old hands. And he says,
[22:34] "What am I going to do with this?"
[22:37] And my grandma looked at him and she
[22:42] said, "Well," she said, "Maybe
[22:46] they just make make that for people that
[22:48] aren't very hungry."
[22:52] My grandpa looked at her and he said, he
[22:55] said, "Honey, you always have a positive
[22:58] thing to say about everything."
[23:01] And that's how she was. She was happy
[23:04] because let me tell you that doesn't
[23:06] mean that the enemy didn't attack
[23:07] grandma. He did. But she overcame that
[23:11] and she had joy in her life every day
[23:16] all the way to the day of day of her
[23:17] death.
[23:19] Now listen to this verse number 14.
[23:23] But the spirit of the Lord departed
[23:27] from Saul,
[23:29] and an evil spirit from the Lord
[23:33] troubled him.
[23:36] Notice the spirit of the Lord departed
[23:38] first
[23:40] and then an evil spirit
[23:43] came in after that. You remember I
[23:46] taught on the parable of the house that
[23:50] had an evil spirit in it. And when that
[23:53] evil spirit was cast out, this man
[23:56] cleaned his house and and made
[23:58] everything right and everything good.
[24:00] The evil spirit was gone. And it could
[24:02] be an evil spirit of pornography. It
[24:03] could be an evil spirit of hatred. It
[24:05] could be an evil spirit of gossip.
[24:07] Whatever it is, but when you overcome
[24:09] that spirit and you push it out, then
[24:12] there's a void there.
[24:14] And here the the it's the opposite that
[24:17] happened. The spirit of the Lord
[24:19] departed out of Saul and now he's got a
[24:22] hole.
[24:24] Something's got to fill that hole.
[24:27] And us when we get rid of something in
[24:30] our lives, make sure friends that you
[24:33] replace it with something because that
[24:36] if that hole stays there, it's going to
[24:38] get worse. Like the parable that Jesus
[24:40] told of the house, if you don't replace
[24:42] it, if you don't fill it up with the
[24:43] Holy Spirit, it's going to get worse.
[24:46] And here Saul, the Holy Spirit comes out
[24:48] of him and now he's got a hole and here
[24:52] comes the enemy, the spirit.
[24:58] English Standard Version says, "Now the
[25:00] spirit of the Lord departed from Saul
[25:02] and a harmful spirit from the Lord
[25:04] tormented him." NIV says an evil spirit
[25:08] from the Lord tormented him. It's very
[25:13] plain. This is from the Lord. So my
[25:17] question and the question that was
[25:18] presented to me from one of the young
[25:20] people is how can an evil spirit come
[25:26] from God if God's holy? Have you ever
[25:30] thought of it?
[25:32] &gt;&gt; How could it happen?
[25:34] But it does happen. So, does God send
[25:38] demons on us?
[25:41] Does God have evil spirits in him that
[25:43] come out of him? Of course not. God is
[25:47] holy. God's perfect. God's the
[25:50] omnipotent. God's everything. God is
[25:52] just pure love. So, how can an evil
[25:54] spirit come from God? As I give the
[25:59] uh scriptures for the explanation, I
[26:02] want you to think about this. When I
[26:03] moved to Jeffersonville,
[26:06] I came from Tucson.
[26:10] That means I was in Tucson
[26:13] geographically and I moved to
[26:15] Jeffersonville. And then I was in
[26:17] Jeffersonville and I moved to Tucson.
[26:21] Okay, so think about that as I give
[26:23] these incredible
[26:26] scriptures and how of something that
[26:28] probably happens all the time. This
[26:31] thing that happened to Saul probably
[26:34] happens very very often commonly. Let's
[26:37] go to Job chapter 1 verse 6.
[26:45] And here I believe is the answer to the
[26:48] question.
[26:50] Now, there was a day when the sons of
[26:53] God came to present themselves before
[26:56] the Lord, and Satan came also among
[27:00] them.
[27:02] Friends, there's things going on in
[27:04] heaven that we don't know, that we don't
[27:06] understand.
[27:08] But this is in heaven,
[27:10] and here are the wonderful things going
[27:12] on in heaven. But Satan was there, too.
[27:17] And the Lord said unto Satan, "Whence
[27:19] comest thou?" And Satan answered the
[27:21] Lord and said, "From going to and fro on
[27:24] the earth, and walking up and down in
[27:26] it." And the Lord said unto Satan, "Hast
[27:28] thou considered my servant Job, that
[27:30] there is none like him on the earth, a
[27:32] perfect and upright man, one that fearth
[27:35] God, and one that estueth evil, one that
[27:37] hates evil." And then Satan answered the
[27:40] Lord, and said, "Dust thou doth Job fear
[27:43] God for not? Hast thou not? Hast thou
[27:46] made a hedge around him? Hast not thou
[27:48] made a hedge around him, and about his
[27:51] house, and about all that he hath on
[27:54] every side, thou hast blessed the work
[27:56] of his hands, and his substance, and his
[27:58] increases in the land. So, Satan's
[28:00] saying, God, he's saying, of course, Job
[28:03] loves you. You've blessed him. You've
[28:05] given him a good family. You've given
[28:07] money. You've given him a big house.
[28:09] You've given him all of this. Of course,
[28:10] that he loves you. It's amazing. This is
[28:14] going on in heaven.
[28:17] Poor Job down here. He's just out
[28:20] working his field.
[28:26] But put forth put forth thine hand now
[28:29] and touch him and touch all that he
[28:31] hath, and he will curse thee to thy
[28:33] face. And the Lord said unto Satan,
[28:36] Behold, all that he hath is in thy
[28:39] power. Only upon himself put not forth
[28:42] thine hand. So, Satan went forth from
[28:45] the presence of the Lord.
[28:47] Satan went forth from the presence
[28:52] of the Lord. An evil spirit came from
[28:57] the presence of God
[28:59] to come upon Job.
[29:02] Satan killed Job's livestock, took all
[29:04] of his wealth, even killed his children.
[29:07] The spirit came from the same location
[29:12] that God was.
[29:14] And you could say, as I said, you could
[29:16] say an evil spirit came from the Lord.
[29:20] It came upon Job and his family. But
[29:22] watch how Job handles this now. Took
[29:25] everything from him. Verse verse number
[29:27] 20.
[29:28] Then Job arose. So So Job has all of his
[29:32] children are dead. All of his wealth is
[29:35] gone. He had lost everything. And Job
[29:39] arose and rent his manel mantel and
[29:41] shaved his head and fell down upon the
[29:43] ground and worshiped.
[29:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:45] &gt;&gt; Wow. Look at that. Job worshiped.
[29:50] And he said, "Naked came I out of my
[29:52] mother's womb, and naked shall I return
[29:54] hither. The Lord gave, and the Lord
[29:56] taketh away. Blessed be the name of the
[29:59] Lord."
[30:01] &gt;&gt; And listen to this. Here's the
[30:04] difference between Job and Saul. And in
[30:08] all this, Job sinned not, nor charged
[30:12] God foolishly.
[30:15] Then he did it again, another meeting in
[30:18] heaven. Chapter 2, verse one. Again,
[30:21] again, there was a day when the sons of
[30:23] God came to present themselves before
[30:25] the Lord. And Satan came also among them
[30:28] to present himself before the Lord.
[30:32] Again, there is Satan up in heaven
[30:35] accusing a son of God there and asking,
[30:40] "Let me go down." And he says, "Skin for
[30:44] skin."
[30:46] He says, "Take his health away
[30:50] and then see what Job does to you, God."
[30:54] God says, "Go. Don't kill him. Go." So
[30:57] then Joe then Satan goes and makes Job
[31:01] sick. Probably cancerous tumors or
[31:04] whatever it was just just in a terrible
[31:07] shape. And then yet still
[31:11] verse number 10
[31:15] when his wife tells him why don't you
[31:18] just curse God and die after he'd been
[31:19] suffering all this. Job said unto her
[31:22] thou speakest like one of the foolish
[31:24] women speaketh. What shall we receive
[31:27] good at the hand of God? And shall we
[31:29] not receive evil in all of this? In all
[31:32] this, did not Job sin with his lips?
[31:37] &gt;&gt; What a man.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; Look at the difference. Same thing
[31:41] happened to Saul and Saul gave in.
[31:44] Let's go to first. Let's go to 2
[31:47] Chronicles. Another story of this. And
[31:49] here's a failure. We saw the success in
[31:53] Job. 2 Chronicles verse 18. Listen to
[31:57] this the story. Don't give in to it.
[32:03] Many times the enemy will come down
[32:08] and you resist him. So resist him.
[32:13] 2 Chronicles
[32:15] 18:14.
[32:17] Then he came to the king.
[32:20] So, we know Micah, we know Ahab, and we
[32:23] know Jehoshaphat. All right. There's
[32:25] there's Micah and I'm sorry, Jehoshaphat
[32:28] and Ahab are two kings. Jehoshaphat's
[32:31] king of Judah. Uh Ahab's king of Israel.
[32:34] And they want to go to battle. And Micah
[32:38] says, "Well, I think that we should
[32:40] inquire of the Lord."
[32:44] Then came the king. Then then then he
[32:46] came to the king. And the king said to
[32:48] him, "Micah, shall we go to war against
[32:50] Ramoth Gilead, or shall we refrain?" I'm
[32:53] going to read the New King James
[32:54] Version. And he said, "Go and prosper,
[32:56] and they shall be delivered into your
[32:58] hand." So the king said to him, "How
[33:01] many times shall I make you swear that
[33:03] you tell me nothing but the truth in the
[33:06] name of the Lord?" Then he said, listen
[33:09] to this. So So Ahab's like, "Listen,
[33:11] you're always prophesying against me."
[33:13] Ahab was an evil dude. And he's he was
[33:15] like, "Listen, this guy's a a prophet.
[33:17] He's a righteous man. And he's always
[33:19] saying stuff against me."
[33:22] And Micah the prophet's like, "Yes, go
[33:24] what? Go do what you're going to do."
[33:26] And he's like, "Just tell us the truth."
[33:29] So the king said to him, "How many times
[33:31] shall I make you swear to tell me
[33:33] nothing but the truth in the name of the
[33:35] Lord?" Then Micah said, then then he
[33:38] said, I saw all Israel scattered on on
[33:42] the mountains as sheep that have no
[33:44] shepherd. And the Lord said, "These have
[33:46] no master. Let each return to his house
[33:49] in peace." And the king of Israel said
[33:52] to Jehoshaphat, "Did not I tell you that
[33:56] that he would not prophesy good
[33:58] concerning me, but evil?" Now listen to
[34:01] this another story. Saul, Job, watch
[34:07] this. And Micah said, "Therefore, hear
[34:10] the word of the Lord.
[34:12] I saw the Lord sitting on his throne and
[34:15] all the host of heaven standing on his
[34:17] right hand and on his left." And the
[34:19] Lord said, "Who will persuade Ahab, king
[34:23] of Israel, to go up that he may fall at
[34:27] Ramothgilead?"
[34:30] So one spoke in this manner and another
[34:32] spoke in that manner. Then
[34:36] a spirit came forward and stood before
[34:40] the Lord. This is going on in heaven.
[34:42] God's not in hell.
[34:44] Then a spirit came forward and stood
[34:47] before the Lord and said, "I will
[34:49] persuade him."
[34:51] The Lord said to him, "In what way?"
[34:54] And he said, 'I will go out and be a
[34:57] lying spirit in the mouth of all of his
[35:00] prophets. And the Lord said, you shall
[35:03] persuade him and also prevail. Go out
[35:06] and do so. Therefore, look, the Lord has
[35:10] put a lying spirit in the mouth of these
[35:12] prophets of yours, and the Lord hath
[35:14] declared
[35:16] disaster,
[35:18] evil against you. So these prophets of
[35:22] Ahab, they did not resist that lying
[35:28] spirit
[35:30] that came on them. I believe that they
[35:32] had a choice. I truly do. But they
[35:35] didn't resist it. I believe that they
[35:38] knew when they felt that still small
[35:42] voice maybe that said, "Don't say that.
[35:45] Are you sure that came from the Lord?"
[35:47] And because of popularity of because of
[35:49] of of pressure from someone else, they
[35:51] just said it. And there was that spirit
[35:55] influencing them. But when that spirit
[35:59] came to Job,
[36:01] no, no, I'm not going to give into it.
[36:04] But when it came to Saul, he did not
[36:07] resist it. He gave into it. Even Jesus,
[36:11] same thing happened to Jesus. Remember
[36:14] he was tempt temp tempted in the
[36:15] wilderness for 40 days.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; Here comes the enemy
[36:20] and he's he's like
[36:23] turn these stones to bread. I know
[36:24] you're hungry. Aren't you the Messiah?
[36:28] Aren't you this this one that's supposed
[36:30] to come? Tempted him with the power of
[36:33] God.
[36:35] Well, you have power. You have power.
[36:36] Why don't you do it?
[36:39] He said, "No." He says, "God's able with
[36:41] these stones erased." you know, he said
[36:43] uh um man shall not live by bread alone,
[36:46] but by every word that comes out of the
[36:48] mouth of God.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; And he brings him up to the temple.
[36:53] He's like, "Cast yourself down. You want
[36:56] to show the power of God, don't you?
[36:58] Doesn't it make sense? We would want to
[37:00] show the power of God." Of course, it
[37:02] makes sense. But it was not time for
[37:05] Jesus to do it.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; And there he is. They're like cast the
[37:10] the enemy right there. That same spirit
[37:12] comes and says, "Cast yourself down
[37:14] because it is written that the angels
[37:16] shall carry you up." He's like, "Satan,
[37:20] don't tempt the Lord thy God."
[37:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; Jesus resisted it.
[37:26] Just like James says, "Resist the devil
[37:29] and and it will flee and he will flee
[37:32] from you." Let's go back to 1st Samuel
[37:34] 16.
[37:36] And Saul's servant said unto him, so now
[37:39] we know that this evil spirit,
[37:44] God, there's no evil in God, but this
[37:47] evil spirit came from God.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; All right? So I think we understand now
[37:52] it came from the presence of God.
[37:55] And Saul's servant said to him, "Behold
[37:57] now, an evil spirit from God troubleth
[37:59] thee. Let our Lord command thy servants
[38:03] which are before thee
[38:06] to seek out a man who is cunning a
[38:10] cunning player on the harp. And it shall
[38:12] come to pass when the evil spirit from
[38:14] God is upon thee thee that he shall play
[38:17] with his hand and thou shalt be well.
[38:20] I'm sorry. I'm in 1st Samuel 16. There
[38:22] we go. So the author keeps making that
[38:25] statement, an evil spirit from God. And
[38:28] here we see that this evil spirit came
[38:32] from God. Why? God had a purpose in it.
[38:36] God has a purpose in it every time. He
[38:38] had a purpose in it in Job. He wanted to
[38:40] prove the devil wrong. He had a purpose
[38:42] in it with Ahab. He wanted them to go to
[38:45] battle. And then Ahab died in the
[38:46] battle. And here he has a purpose in
[38:51] having this evil spirit come down from
[38:55] God because there was only one man in
[38:59] all of the kingdom that could make that
[39:00] evil spirit go away. It was this young
[39:02] man, a shepherd boy,
[39:05] this man named David. So he actually
[39:08] brought this man David into his home.
[39:13] And David had a gift. And you see how
[39:15] brother Sean, you see how beautiful a
[39:17] gift of music is.
[39:19] It can truly
[39:21] send away
[39:23] these evil spirits. It can literally and
[39:27] you're playing in your piano and just
[39:29] and and how someone that just has a
[39:31] gift,
[39:33] it can send the evil spirits away.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; And that's what would happen with Saul.
[39:40] Saul didn't really fight it. It was this
[39:43] beautiful playing that caused that evil
[39:47] spirit to leave.
[39:50] And Saul, verse number 17, and Saul said
[39:53] unto his servants, provide me now a man
[39:55] that can play well and bring him to me.
[39:58] Then answered one of the servants and
[40:00] said, "Behold, I have seen a son of
[40:02] Jesse the Bethlehemite that is cunning
[40:05] and playing and a and a mighty valiant
[40:07] man and a man of war." this young man
[40:12] and we're seeing here what this young
[40:14] man is going to become and prudent in
[40:16] matters and come and a comely person and
[40:19] the Lord is with him. Verse number 23,
[40:22] let's skip down. And it came to pass
[40:25] when the evil spirit from God was upon
[40:27] Saul that David took a harp and played
[40:30] with his hand. So Saul was refreshed
[40:35] and was well and the evil spirit
[40:37] departed from him.
[40:41] That's how
[40:43] all of us here have had this experience.
[40:46] That's how spirits work.
[40:49] An evil spirit will come upon us
[40:54] and it's when somebody does us wrong. If
[40:56] you have a bad temper, it's when someone
[41:00] says something that makes you mad or
[41:01] insults you. Then that evil spirit comes
[41:04] down and instead of resisting, out it
[41:06] comes. All right? And then after a
[41:09] little while, that evil spirit just kind
[41:11] of goes away. You don't have to worry
[41:14] about your temper when everything's
[41:15] going well, right? No, you don't have to
[41:19] worry about gluttony when you're full.
[41:23] It's that's not the time.
[41:26] And that's how spirits are. The spirit
[41:29] will come in when the door is opened.
[41:34] And that's what happened with Saul. and
[41:36] saw the spirit would come in when he
[41:39] would get jealous and he picked up his
[41:40] spear and chucked it at David couple
[41:43] times. Started trying to kill David
[41:45] because he saw that David started to
[41:47] prosper and then this jealousy came out
[41:50] and he would get mad and instead of
[41:52] fighting the spirit like Job did. He
[41:54] would take his spear, go after him, send
[41:57] his troops in. We want to kill this man
[42:00] David. He even wanted his daughter. He
[42:02] let David marry his daughter and he
[42:04] thought, "Oh, my daughter, she'll be
[42:06] loyal to me and she can be a spy."
[42:10] And his daughter fell in love with
[42:12] David. I mean, it was her husband, but
[42:14] his daughter fell in love with David,
[42:15] too. And she warned him. Even his
[42:19] beloved son who was heir to the kingdom,
[42:23] who he was so proud of, Jonathan.
[42:26] Jonathan loved David and respected David
[42:29] more than he did his dad.
[42:31] And you can see how every time this
[42:35] spirit would come down, Saul would not
[42:39] he he wouldn't fight it. And as you read
[42:42] through and you you see this man Saul,
[42:45] there are times when there's two times
[42:47] when David Saul goes into the into the
[42:50] cave one time by himself, use the
[42:54] restroom and he's in there and David's
[42:56] hitting in the back and his men are
[42:59] like, "Take him now.
[43:02] We've got him."
[43:04] David said, "I'm not going to touch the
[43:06] Lord's anointed." David cuts off his
[43:10] robe. Saul gets up. He goes outside.
[43:14] And David is like, "Hey, Saul, look at
[43:16] this. I have a piece of your robe."
[43:20] And then Saul, that spirit
[43:24] left him and he was like, "Oh, David,
[43:28] you know, you should be king. You're a
[43:30] better man than I am, David." And then
[43:32] David repented. He's like, "Oh, I
[43:34] shouldn't have done that. This is the
[43:35] Lord's anointed. I should respect him."
[43:37] And you see all this love going on and
[43:39] this is really nice and everything's
[43:41] good until Saul gets mad again.
[43:45] Turn the page. Then Saul gets mad again.
[43:48] He's he's trying to kill David again
[43:49] because he didn't resist the spirit.
[43:53] It's not hard to resist a spirit when
[43:57] you're not tested.
[44:00] Whatever that spirit is.
[44:03] But when you are tested is when you can
[44:07] overcome that spirit. That is what the
[44:10] character is. When David, David didn't
[44:12] have it. Here comes Saul and Saul's
[44:14] trying to kill David. David has many
[44:16] chances to kill Saul, but he's like,
[44:18] "No, that's the Lord's anointed." David
[44:20] overcame. You think David didn't have
[44:21] feelings?
[44:23] David was a warrior. I mean, he killed
[44:25] the giant with a rock. He killed a a
[44:29] bear, a wolf, and he killed a lion. a
[44:32] bear and a lion with a rock. He knew he
[44:35] could do it. You think David didn't have
[44:38] feelings? He did.
[44:40] And he failed. But then he repented and
[44:43] he overcame and didn't do it again. And
[44:46] and here is Saul twice. And the other
[44:48] time David sneaks up and and Saul's
[44:50] sleeping, steals his spear, and then he
[44:53] feels bad about it. And then Saul feels
[44:55] bad about it again. He doesn't have this
[44:57] madness upon him. But then a little bit
[44:59] later, it's like, "Oh, David, you know,
[45:02] he's everybody's liking him better than
[45:03] me." And then this rage and this
[45:05] jealousy comes in and he didn't overcome
[45:07] it.
[45:09] Even right when it started,
[45:12] David,
[45:14] Saul sent David out and David starts
[45:16] winning these battles. And man, David
[45:19] was just tearing it up. What a great man
[45:22] David was. and he'd come back and play
[45:24] the harp and Saul would be happy and
[45:26] then he'd go out and kill Philistines
[45:27] and and it was just like, man, this guy
[45:29] is great. And then he comes in and here
[45:33] these women when when they're coming in
[45:35] in the parade into the city, these women
[45:37] are like, wow. And they come out for
[45:41] Saul, not David.
[45:44] They come out to honor their king.
[45:48] The Bible says that. Where is it? Let's
[45:51] read it.
[45:53] It's really good.
[45:57] Yeah. Uh chapter 18 verse 6.
[46:02] This is really neat.
[46:05] 1st Samuel 18. And it came to pass as
[46:08] they came when David was returned from
[46:09] the slaughter of the Philistine that the
[46:12] women came out of all the cities of
[46:13] Israel singing and dancing to meet King
[46:17] Saul their king
[46:21] with tabres and joy and with instruments
[46:24] and music. They were all happy and
[46:25] praising the Lord. And the women
[46:27] answered one another as they played. And
[46:29] they they said Saul has slain his
[46:32] thousands
[46:34] and David his 10 thousands.
[46:38] Saul's like, "What?"
[46:41] And they were just rejoicing like, "We
[46:43] love you, Saul." They're not trying to
[46:45] put David in front of him.
[46:47] They were out there for Saul, but they
[46:49] were just happy. And you, we should be
[46:52] happy. If someone comes in and he does a
[46:55] good job or she does a good job, praise
[46:58] God,
[47:00] &gt;&gt; a good job was done. David's rolling
[47:02] through all these Philistines. Yeah,
[47:04] those are our enemies. Way to go, David.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean Saul wasn't king, but he
[47:09] got jealous.
[47:12] Saul has slain his thousands and David
[47:14] his 10 thousands. And Saul was very
[47:16] wroth and the saying displeased him.
[47:21] And he said, "They have ascribed unto
[47:23] David 10 thousands, and me they have
[47:25] ascribed but thousands.
[47:28] And what can he have more but the
[47:30] kingdom?" He's already anointed king in
[47:34] secret. And Saul's like, "I see the
[47:37] handwriting on the wall here."
[47:40] And instead of embracing this David,
[47:43] he hated him.
[47:46] and his mental and spiritual
[47:48] deterioration really sped up then. And
[47:51] this evil spirit from God, the spirit of
[47:54] jealousy and depression and hatred, it
[47:57] just dominated his life.
[48:01] As I said, even his great son Jonathan,
[48:05] this great warrior, probably the
[48:07] greatest warrior in in all of Israel,
[48:11] even he
[48:13] protected David
[48:15] over he did over what he did over his
[48:18] dad.
[48:21] Then what? Let's let's read it and uh I
[48:25] think we have time. So things got bad.
[48:27] Things got so bad with Saul
[48:32] and then the enemy just came in and and
[48:35] he just chased he's chasing David all
[48:37] over the place and then he have to pull
[48:38] away from David and he fight the
[48:40] Philistines. He never lost his gift. We
[48:43] we the gifts and calling of God are
[48:45] without repentance. God doesn't take
[48:47] them back. Saul was still just as gifted
[48:50] a man at the day of his death death as
[48:52] he was at the day he was crowned king.
[48:54] He continued to beat the Philistines,
[48:56] but he then he just set his eyes on
[48:58] David and he wanted to kill this guy. So
[49:01] he would chase David and his his band of
[49:03] of men up in the mountains and he go all
[49:06] over and and just trying to kill him.
[49:08] And it got so bad Samuel dies and it got
[49:11] so bad that that God just wouldn't
[49:13] answer David or answer Saul.
[49:16] And he had this great battle and he was
[49:19] afraid. He's like, "Man, this is big. I
[49:23] could lose the whole kingdom in this
[49:24] battle with the Philistines.
[49:27] And he went, very strange story. He went
[49:30] to a medium.
[49:33] He went to a fortune teller, someone
[49:36] that had some sort of a strange gift
[49:39] there. And let's read it. And it came to
[49:42] pass first um chapter 26, we'll start
[49:45] with verse number three. Now Samuel was
[49:48] dead, and all Israel had lamented him
[49:50] and buried him in Rama, even in his own
[49:54] city. And Saul had put away those that
[49:57] had familiar spirits and wizards out of
[49:58] the land. So Saul did right. He knew
[50:01] God, and he had done right.
[50:04] And the Philistines gathered themselves
[50:06] together and came and pitched in Shunim.
[50:08] And Saul gathered all Israel together,
[50:10] and they pitched in Gal Gilboa. And when
[50:12] Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he
[50:14] was afraid, and his heart greatly
[50:16] trembled. And when Saul inquired of the
[50:18] Lord, the Lord answered him not.
[50:20] Wouldn't answer him at all. Neither by
[50:22] dreams, nor by urum, nor by prophets.
[50:27] From other Bible studies, we know what
[50:28] the urum is. Of course, we know what
[50:30] dreams are, and we know what prophets
[50:32] are.
[50:34] Then said Saul unto his servants, "Seek
[50:36] me a woman that hath a familiar spirit,
[50:38] that I may go to her and inquire of
[50:40] her." And his servant said to him,
[50:42] "Behold, there is a woman that hath a
[50:44] familiar spirit at indor." We know her
[50:46] as the witch of Endor.
[50:49] Then Saul disguised himself
[50:52] and put on other reignment and went and
[50:55] two men with him. And they came to the
[50:58] woman by night, and he said, I pray thee
[51:01] divine unto me by the familiar spirit,
[51:04] and bring me him up who I shall name to
[51:08] thee. And the woman said, "Behold, thou
[51:10] knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath
[51:13] cut off those that have familiar
[51:14] spirits, and the wizards out of the
[51:16] land. Therefore, when thou layst thou a
[51:18] snare, therefore then thou layst thou a
[51:20] snare from my life to cause me to die."
[51:23] So she's like, "Hey, listen. It's
[51:25] against the law for me to do this. And
[51:28] according to the law that Saul set, I
[51:31] got to be put to death if I do it."
[51:34] And Saul, who was disguised, swear to
[51:38] her by the Lord, saying, "As the Lord
[51:39] liveth, there shall there shall no
[51:42] punishment happen to thee for this
[51:44] thing." Then said the woman, "Whom shall
[51:47] I bring up unto thee?" And he said,
[51:49] "Bring me up Samuel."
[51:53] And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried
[51:55] with a loud voice. And the woman spake
[51:58] to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived
[52:00] me? For thou art Saul. She knew, "Wow,
[52:04] I'm in a bad position here. This is the
[52:07] king that has done this." And the king
[52:09] said to her, "Be not afraid,
[52:12] for what sawest thou?" And the woman
[52:15] said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out
[52:18] of the earth. New King James says, "I
[52:21] saw a spirit descending out of the
[52:23] earth." ascending out of the earth.
[52:25] English Standard Version said says, "I
[52:27] see a God coming out of the earth."
[52:30] Amplified version
[52:32] says this, "I see a divine superhuman
[52:36] being coming up from the earth." So, she
[52:39] saw something that was probably more
[52:41] powerful than she had ever seen in all
[52:43] of her gifts. It was the spirit of the
[52:45] prophet Samuel
[52:47] rising up. And he said to her, "What
[52:50] form is he of what form is he of?" And
[52:53] she said, "An old man cometh up, and he
[52:55] is covered with a mantle." And Saul
[52:57] perceived that it was Samuel. And he
[52:59] stooped with his face to the ground and
[53:01] bowed himself. And Samuel said, "Saul,
[53:05] why hast thou disquited me to bring me
[53:08] up?" And Saul answered, "I am sore
[53:12] distressed, for the Philistines make war
[53:15] against me, and God has departed from
[53:17] me, and answerth me no more, neither by
[53:20] prophets, nor by dreams. Therefore, I
[53:22] have called thee that thou mayest make
[53:24] known unto me what I shall do.
[53:27] He was going to war. God wouldn't answer
[53:30] him. All of these people of Israel and
[53:33] the whole country of Israel depended on
[53:34] him. And he's like, I don't know what to
[53:37] do. And Samuel said, wherefore then dust
[53:42] thou ask of me, seeing the Lord has
[53:44] departed from thee, and has become thine
[53:47] enemy. saying
[53:50] enemies. You're the the Lord is your
[53:53] enemy. You're the enemy of the Lord now,
[53:55] Saul, because you are serving yourself.
[53:58] You have departed.
[54:02] And the and the Lord hath done to him as
[54:06] he spake by me. For the Lord hath rent
[54:10] the kingdom out of thy hand, and given
[54:13] it to thy neighbor, even to David,
[54:17] because thou obeyest not the voice of
[54:20] the Lord, nor executed his fierce wrath
[54:23] upon Amalecch, the Amalachites. Remember
[54:26] that the situation I just talked I
[54:28] talked about the beginning. Therefore,
[54:29] the Lord hath done this thing unto thee
[54:31] this day.
[54:33] He didn't kill King Aag. He didn't kill
[54:36] all of those animals. And that was a big
[54:39] deal.
[54:40] Notice Samuel didn't overstep God here.
[54:44] He didn't tell Saul what to do. He just
[54:46] prophesied what was about to happen.
[54:49] Moreover, the Lord will also deliver
[54:51] Israel with thee into the hand of the
[54:52] Philistines. And tomorrow shalt thou and
[54:55] thy sons be with me.
[55:00] Tomorrow shalt thou and thy sons be with
[55:04] me.
[55:06] Samuel speaking. The Lord also shall
[55:08] deliver the host of Israel into the
[55:09] hands of the Philistines. Jonathan was
[55:11] still alive and he was about to fight in
[55:14] this battle. Jonathan was about to die.
[55:17] Saul was about to fight in this battle.
[55:18] Saul was about to die. They were about
[55:21] to lose. But wherever Samuel was at that
[55:24] time, there was Saul and his son
[55:28] together going to be with the prophet.
[55:34] Then then Saul fell straightway all
[55:36] along the earth and was so afraid
[55:39] because the words of Samuel and there
[55:41] was no strength in him for he had eaten
[55:43] no bread all the all the day nor all the
[55:45] night. And the woman came to Saul and
[55:48] saw that he was sore troubled and said
[55:51] unto him, Behold, thy handmade o hath
[55:53] obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life
[55:56] in thy hand, and I have hearkened unto
[55:59] thy words, which thou spakeest unto me.
[56:01] Even this witch
[56:03] who Saul had promised not to kill, she
[56:06] still had respect for King Saul. She
[56:08] still had compassion.
[56:11] Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou
[56:13] also unto the voice of thine handmmaid,
[56:15] and let me set a morsel of bread before
[56:17] thee, and eat, that thou mayest have
[56:20] strength when thou goest on thy way. But
[56:22] he refused and said, I will not eat. But
[56:24] his servants together with the woman
[56:26] compelled him, and he hearkened under
[56:28] their voice. So he arose from the earth
[56:30] and sat upon the bed. And the woman had
[56:33] a fat calf in the house. And she
[56:35] hastened and killed it, and took flour,
[56:37] and kneaded it, and baked unleavened
[56:39] bread thereof. And she brought it before
[56:42] Saul and before his servants, and they
[56:44] did eat, and they rose up, and went away
[56:48] that night.
[56:52] and the uh we can close now and
[56:56] the um the musicians can come and get
[56:58] ready. So then what happened
[57:03] to Saul is exactly what was prophesied
[57:06] when Samuel came.
[57:08] They went to battle. Israel lost the
[57:12] battle.
[57:14] Saul was hit by an arrow, mortally
[57:18] wounded him. Jonathan was killed in
[57:21] battle and
[57:24] Saul was dying
[57:27] and he asked his armor bearer, he said,
[57:29] "Kill me because they're they're going
[57:32] to take me and they're going to abuse
[57:34] me. I'm mortally wounded." He asked his
[57:36] armor bearer, he says, "Will you kill
[57:38] me?" His armor bearer says, "No, I I
[57:40] can't do that." So then Saul takes his
[57:43] sword
[57:45] and falls on his sword himself.
[57:49] And
[57:51] Bible's a little bit unclear
[57:54] if Saul died right there.
[57:58] The next book you see that this man
[58:01] comes to David and says, "Hey, Saul was
[58:04] mortally wounded and I killed him."
[58:09] And uh that didn't work out so good for
[58:11] that guy. Um David ended up killing him.
[58:15] But
[58:17] Saul died on the battlefield.
[58:20] What he was called to serve Israel. A
[58:24] great king, a great leader. Died on the
[58:27] battlefield,
[58:28] his son with him and ended up wherever
[58:32] Samuel was.
[58:35] And I believe that Samuel was in glory.
[58:39] And Saul ended up there. This man that
[58:43] could not overcome this evil spirit that
[58:46] came from God. This spirit of hatred,
[58:49] the spirit of jealousy. And he struggled
[58:51] his whole la life. He did many, many
[58:54] things wrong.
[58:56] And really, I'm so happy that his story
[58:58] is written in the Bible because as
[59:00] brother Silas said, I can just relate to
[59:02] it. I can relate to this man. I see that
[59:07] Saul when when the spirit, the evil
[59:11] spirit would come on him, it was always
[59:13] in a point of weakness. And then when
[59:15] that weakness wasn't there, he was like,
[59:17] "David, you should be king. I love you,
[59:19] David. And and David, you're the you're
[59:22] you're the the true man and you're
[59:23] you're you're much greater man than I
[59:26] am, David." And then you see all of a
[59:29] sudden when the anger would come, he
[59:31] would go after David and try to kill
[59:32] him. And that's how, as I said, that's
[59:35] how spirits are. And you know what?
[59:36] That's how the Holy Spirit is, too.
[59:39] We always want to have the Holy Spirit.
[59:41] We always want to feel it. And we have,
[59:43] we felt it. Sometimes it makes us cry.
[59:45] Sometimes it makes us shout. Sometimes
[59:47] it'll make us speak in tongues.
[59:49] And I just wish it was always on me. But
[59:52] that's how a spirit does. The spirit
[59:54] comes and then it backs off and it comes
[59:58] back. It's a nature of a spirit and then
[1:00:00] it and then it backs off. And that's how
[1:00:03] friends, that's how the evil spirit is
[1:00:05] too that comes down.
[1:00:07] It'll come upon you and you say, "Well,
[1:00:09] why sometimes can I overcome and other
[1:00:11] times I can't?" It's because that's when
[1:00:14] that spirit's attacking and it always
[1:00:15] attacks in a point of weakness. And Saul
[1:00:18] is a perfect example of how we can fail.
[1:00:22] And then David is a perfect example of
[1:00:25] how we can succeed. Amen.
