[28:37] and then with all the things that they
[28:40] can today do today they found out he had
[28:43] been not guilty

[38:37] appreciate all the specials our sister
[38:40] there they're just saying sister you're
[38:42] back looking you looks like you're
[38:44] feeling a lot better
[38:46] am I right when you came up to sing
[38:49] God God bless you she came up for prayer
[38:52] this morning I could tell she was in a
[38:53] lot of pain thank the Lord he's good to
[38:55] us
[38:57] sister Angela's her song is I will make
[39:00] this trial a blessing and that's how it
[39:03] is friends when we go through all these
[39:05] trials when these things are hard and
[39:08] sometimes we ask the Lord Lord why do I
[39:11] go through this why do things get so
[39:14] hard
[39:15] but he has a long-term plan
[39:18] and this long-term plan isn't for us to
[39:21] be a bunch of
[39:24] sissified Christians he wants men and
[39:29] women of God he wants us to be strong
[39:31] and only the only way to get strong is
[39:36] to work those muscles and that's what
[39:38] the Lord does he he allows us to go
[39:41] through these hard times to work those
[39:43] muscles for in the future maybe we can
[39:46] help somebody else
[39:48] not only can we get through the harder
[39:50] times in the future because it builds
[39:52] our character but maybe also we can help
[39:55] other people with our own experiences
[39:58] and the Lord Jesus he went through the
[40:00] hardest of it and he is our example
[40:04] as as I'll read and talk about this
[40:08] morning
[40:09] God's greatest
[40:12] desire
[40:14] I believe
[40:15] and I know I can prove it in the
[40:17] scriptures God's greatest desire is to
[40:20] have fellowship with his people
[40:23] to have communion with his people
[40:27] we started out in the Garden of Eden he
[40:29] built this place for his son and his
[40:32] daughter to live in and they fell
[40:34] through sin we know the the sin that
[40:39] that they committed so they came out of
[40:43] the garden and then they had children
[40:45] and they started to multiply on the
[40:47] Earth
[40:48] they had two sons Cain and Abel
[40:54] and both of these boys they grew up and
[40:57] they made sacrifices to the Lord
[41:00] and
[41:02] Abel made a very strange
[41:07] sacrifice he took a lamb
[41:11] from his flock of sheep and he killed
[41:16] the Lamb on the altar as a sacrifice to
[41:19] the Lord
[41:21] Abel on the other hand
[41:23] he didn't like maybe the way that that
[41:26] looked it didn't quite fit the way that
[41:28] he thought it should be so Abel built he
[41:31] built an altar and he built put flowers
[41:33] like this on it and and
[41:35] they put fruit on there he said surely
[41:38] the Lord will like this sacrifice better
[41:42] than that of my brother
[41:45] and
[41:47] God
[41:48] he looked down upon these these two
[41:51] young men
[41:53] and he accepted that of Abel
[41:57] and he rejected Cain's sacrifice
[42:01] and it upset Cain
[42:04] Cain didn't he didn't understand why
[42:06] Lord that is that's that's gross that's
[42:09] not the way that we should do things I
[42:11] think that we should do it and have it a
[42:14] big beautiful altar this makes more
[42:16] sense in my mind
[42:19] but God said no
[42:21] he said no Cain
[42:23] and it looks like in the scripture that
[42:26] God wanted fellowship with Cain
[42:29] he wanted him to fall into line God is
[42:34] love as the Bible says so this this
[42:37] great Eternal being looked down and he's
[42:40] he said no
[42:42] if you would just do it like your
[42:45] brother does it
[42:46] then that would be acceptable to me
[42:49] and he if Cain would have understand if
[42:53] Cain would have prayed about the matter
[42:55] and Cain would have known the way that
[42:58] God was teaching he would have known
[43:01] that if he would have accepted fruit and
[43:04] flowers and all of this it would have
[43:06] messed up the whole salvation plan of
[43:08] God
[43:09] it wouldn't have worked way down
[43:12] thousands of years down the road the
[43:14] sacrifice that was given late later on
[43:17] it wouldn't have worked if that that
[43:20] that offering of flowers and fruit on
[43:24] the altar would have been acceptable to
[43:27] God
[43:28] but God he understood he saw the
[43:31] long-term pictures sometimes we just see
[43:33] the short term picture like sister
[43:35] Angela like your song
[43:37] it's the these trials that we have now
[43:40] if we would just surrender to God and
[43:43] commune with God and have patience with
[43:47] God
[43:48] then we in the future might understand
[43:51] things a little bit better but Cain
[43:53] didn't it upset Cain Cain was offended
[43:57] that his brother's sacrifice was
[44:00] accepted and his wasn't
[44:02] so much so that he was visually he was
[44:05] upset
[44:07] temper came out and came
[44:10] and Cain
[44:12] lost his temper hated his brother and
[44:16] killed his brother because of this just
[44:21] because of his offering was not accepted
[44:24] but as I said if he would have
[44:26] understood
[44:28] that God's plan did not allow for fruit
[44:34] in that to be an offering it had to be a
[44:37] blood sacrifice or it wouldn't have
[44:40] worked four thousand years down the road
[44:43] when Jesus went to the cross that was
[44:47] the blood sacrifice
[44:49] and this this offering that Abel made
[44:54] was a representation of something that
[44:58] would come much later
[45:01] my subject tonight is is teaching on
[45:05] communion so that we can prepare
[45:07] ourselves this week for what's coming
[45:10] next weekend and I want to answer
[45:13] hopefully some of the questions that may
[45:14] be on your hearts and if you have more
[45:16] questions as I said this morning feel
[45:18] free to email me or or ask me this week
[45:21] because this is this is a very very
[45:23] important subject that we're talking
[45:25] about so much so as I will get to later
[45:28] that Jesus says if you don't do this you
[45:30] have no part with me
[45:32] but if you do it unworthily you're
[45:34] guilty of the damnation you are guilty
[45:37] of the blood of Christ
[45:39] the stakes are high on either side and
[45:41] sorry friends you you got to choose one
[45:43] side or the other on this one you can't
[45:45] just walk down the middle of the way you
[45:47] can't ride the fence you got to get on
[45:49] one side if you're going to do it or if
[45:51] you're not going to do it
[45:53] so Kane
[45:55] he he killed his brother
[45:58] and and God was was going through and
[46:01] let's let's read
[46:04] Genesis chapter
[46:07] 4
[46:12] and we'll see yeah we'll start with
[46:14] verse
[46:16] start with verse three and in the
[46:18] process of time it came to pass that
[46:20] Cain brought of the fruit of the ground
[46:22] and offering unto the Lord and Abel also
[46:26] brought up the first things of his flock
[46:28] and the fact thereof and the Lord had
[46:30] respect unto Abel and to his offering
[46:33] but unto Cain and his offering he had
[46:36] not respect
[46:38] and Cain was very Roth
[46:41] and his countenance fell he was upset
[46:44] and was written all over his face
[46:47] of what of of why he didn't why God
[46:50] would not accept this offering as I said
[46:53] let's skip down to verse 14.
[46:57] so so God
[46:59] goes and he's walking through and and
[47:02] God somehow hears the blood of Abel
[47:07] after Cain had murdered his brother
[47:10] this Blood of Abel was crying out
[47:14] to God
[47:16] and God
[47:18] goes to Cain
[47:21] and he casts him out of this place and
[47:25] he sets a mark on him there is the first
[47:26] mark of the beast
[47:28] and we hear so much about the mark
[47:30] well it's right here in Genesis chapter
[47:32] four that's the very first time we see
[47:34] the mark of the beast
[47:38] in Cain God tells Cain
[47:41] he says he says you're going to leave
[47:43] and then Cain responds that my
[47:46] punishment is greater than I can bear
[47:48] behold thou has driven me out this day
[47:51] from the face of the Earth
[47:53] and from thy face shall I be hid
[47:57] that was the worst of all of it
[48:00] that Cain has to leave and now he is
[48:03] separated from God there is no more
[48:07] communion between this young man and God
[48:12] because
[48:14] that he was too stubborn he was too
[48:18] arrogant to accept God's way
[48:21] which is a blood sacrifice
[48:26] and he says this he says and I shall be
[48:29] he says behold thou has driven me out
[48:32] this day from the face of the Earth
[48:34] and from thy face shall I be hid and I
[48:37] shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in
[48:38] the earth and it shall come to pass that
[48:41] everyone that findeth me shall slay me
[48:44] and even Kane's unbelief and his in his
[48:49] violence and hatred and everything the
[48:52] worst thing that happened with Cain was
[48:55] that he knew that now he was out of
[48:58] communion with God
[49:01] and the reason being is because he just
[49:04] did not line up with what God wanted
[49:08] so we go down through time
[49:12] and we see finally we go 4 000 years of
[49:19] sacrificing in the temple and and and up
[49:22] on the mountains and and it's everything
[49:24] from Bulls to to to goats to Lambs to
[49:29] turtle doves and all of these sacrifices
[49:32] down Through the Ages it all points to
[49:35] one blood sacrifice and that is at the
[49:39] cross
[49:40] the Lamb of God
[49:42] and the Lamb of God he has his disciples
[49:47] there and
[49:49] and he's ministering to a mixed group
[49:52] in John chapter 6. we'll start with with
[49:56] verse 51.
[49:59] and he makes a strange statement laying
[50:03] the foundation here for the communion
[50:06] ordinances that we will be taking
[50:11] Jesus said I am the living bread
[50:14] which came from heaven
[50:16] If any man eat of this bread he shall
[50:19] live forever
[50:20] and the bread that I will give is my
[50:23] flesh which I will give for the life of
[50:26] the world
[50:27] the Jews therefore strove among
[50:29] themselves saying how can this man give
[50:31] us give us his flesh to eat
[50:35] very
[50:36] if you think about it naturally speaking
[50:38] what a
[50:39] disgusting thing to say
[50:42] and that's in their natural thinking
[50:44] like Cain had they could not understand
[50:48] that this was the blood sacrifice
[50:52] then Jesus said unto them verily verily
[50:54] I say unto you
[50:57] except ye eat the Flesh of the son of
[51:00] man and drink his blood you have no life
[51:02] in you now he's jabbing him a little bit
[51:06] further
[51:08] and right here is the important
[51:10] importance of communion
[51:12] if you don't do this
[51:15] then you have no life in you look at the
[51:18] gravity of the situation whosoever
[51:21] eateth My Flesh and drinketh my blood
[51:23] hath eternal life
[51:26] and I will raise him up in the last day
[51:28] Jesus goes a step further and it says if
[51:31] you do this you'll have eternal life and
[51:34] I'll raise you up in the resurrection
[51:37] you have to be so much a part of me
[51:41] I love this part
[51:43] you have to be so much a part of me
[51:47] that you have to take
[51:51] part of me into your own body
[51:55] symbolically speaking we we see the
[51:57] bread
[51:59] we see the communion and spiritually
[52:02] speaking
[52:03] we see brother Wilson the Holy Spirit
[52:08] coming into our bodies look at look at
[52:12] what this communion represents that
[52:14] Jesus is talking about he's even talking
[52:17] about the very spirit
[52:20] and he says this he says for my flesh is
[52:23] meet indeed and my blood is drink indeed
[52:27] he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[52:29] blood dwelleth in me and I in him
[52:33] as the living father has sent me and I
[52:36] live by the father
[52:38] so he that eateth me even he shall live
[52:42] by me wow
[52:45] this is the bread
[52:47] which came down from heaven
[52:51] they're automatically thinking oh Moses
[52:54] in the wilderness the man that came down
[52:57] and laid down on the ground and we were
[53:00] able to pick it up every day this is the
[53:02] bread that came down from heaven not as
[53:05] your father's did he manna no he's
[53:09] that's not it that's not what you're
[53:11] thinking not as your fathers did eat
[53:13] Manna and are dead
[53:17] but he that eateth of this bread shall
[53:20] live forever
[53:22] the beautiful story of communion and the
[53:26] Flesh and the blood
[53:29] of the sacrifice of God the the
[53:31] sacrificial lamb Jesus wanting to
[53:36] commune with his children
[53:40] so now
[53:41] time is going on
[53:43] Jesus's Ministry
[53:46] his Earthly ministry as a Young Man the
[53:48] three years is coming to a close
[53:52] and Jesus
[53:54] it's the last
[53:55] few days of his Earthly life
[53:59] and he's God his disciples
[54:02] together in in this room
[54:06] he had already come into Jerusalem a
[54:09] triumphant King
[54:10] coming through on on the donkey and they
[54:15] were singing Hosanna and and he comes in
[54:18] and the week goes by
[54:21] and then the pressures building on Jesus
[54:26] and he has his disciples
[54:29] around them he brings them together
[54:33] and they're having their last supper and
[54:37] it just so happened that it was also
[54:40] the Passover it was around that time
[54:43] also so it's it's just beautiful how
[54:46] everything lined up with the Passover
[54:48] celebration Matthew chapter 26.
[54:52] verse 26.
[54:57] and here we're going to see the bread
[55:00] and as they were eating Jesus Took bread
[55:03] and blessed it
[55:05] and break it and gave it to the
[55:08] disciples and said take eat this is my
[55:12] body I wonder if they remembered that
[55:15] sermon
[55:16] from a little while ago I wonder if if
[55:19] they understood
[55:22] if they remembered what he said
[55:25] take eat this is my body and he took the
[55:28] cup and he gave thanks and he gave it to
[55:31] them saying drink ye all of it for this
[55:35] is my blood of the new testament which
[55:38] is Shed from many for the remission of
[55:40] sins
[55:42] but I say unto you I will not drink of
[55:46] this fruit of the vine until that day
[55:49] when I drink it new with you in my
[55:53] father's Kingdom
[55:55] and when they had sung A Hymn they went
[55:57] out into the Mount of Olives
[56:01] so that is that's the Book of Matthew it
[56:05] talks about Jesus breaking the bread and
[56:09] giving it out to his disciples before
[56:12] that faith faithful night
[56:15] as he would go down the Garden of
[56:17] Gethsemane now the same story in John
[56:19] 13.
[56:21] we'll start with verse 1.
[56:24] now before the Feast of the Passover
[56:26] when Jesus knew that his hour was come
[56:30] that he should depart out of this world
[56:32] unto the father having loved his own
[56:34] which were in the world he loved them
[56:38] unto the end
[56:40] Hallelujah is right by Jonathan amen how
[56:43] beautiful is the love of Jesus he loves
[56:46] his people all the way to the end and in
[56:50] this case it was his own end that he was
[56:52] facing
[56:55] and supper being ended
[56:57] the devil
[56:59] having now put into the heart of judas's
[57:01] carrot Simon's son to betray him
[57:04] Jesus knowing that the father had given
[57:07] all things into his hands and that he
[57:10] was come from God and went to God the
[57:13] Lord Jesus had the revelation of where
[57:15] he came from and where he was going
[57:17] every Christian that has his Spirit we
[57:21] know where we came from and we know
[57:24] where we are going
[57:27] we may not know Sister Angela's the song
[57:29] goes we may not know the path that lies
[57:33] directly before us but we know the end
[57:34] of the path
[57:41] or was I verse 4.
[57:45] he rises up from supper
[57:47] and laid aside his garments and took a
[57:50] towel and girded himself
[57:53] wrapped it around me
[57:56] and after that he poured water into a
[57:58] basin and began to wash the disciples
[58:01] feet and to wipe them with a towel
[58:04] wherewith he was girded you see exactly
[58:07] how we do feet washing
[58:09] it's right here we have a basin full of
[58:12] water we have a towel and we kneel down
[58:20] then cometh
[58:22] heed of Simon Peter and Peter saith unto
[58:25] him Lord dust thou wash my feet
[58:28] Jesus answered and said unto him what I
[58:31] do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt
[58:34] know hereafter
[58:37] I guess that answered my question
[58:38] earlier maybe they didn't know what was
[58:40] going on
[58:42] Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never
[58:44] wash my feet Thou shalt never wash my
[58:47] feet and Jesus answered if I wash thee
[58:50] not thou has no part with me
[58:54] look at the importance of feet washing
[58:55] and how many churches
[58:58] in the Christian world today practice
[59:00] feet washing
[59:02] that's a serious thing
[59:04] it's you know they don't because well we
[59:07] don't have to do that anymore or it's
[59:10] it's it's
[59:11] uncomfortable doing that but if you
[59:15] don't
[59:16] then you have no part with me is what
[59:19] our lord said
[59:21] Simon Peter saith unto him
[59:25] Lord not my feet only
[59:28] but also my hands and my head
[59:31] Jesus Jesus saith unto him he that is
[59:34] washed washed needeth not saved to wash
[59:37] his feet but is clean every wit
[59:40] and ye are clean but not all
[59:43] for he knew who should be betray him
[59:46] therefore said he ye
[59:49] are not all clean
[59:51] and after the and after he had washed
[59:53] their feet and had taken His Garment and
[59:55] was set down again he said unto them
[59:58] know ye what I have done to you
[1:00:02] you call me master and Lord and you say
[1:00:04] well for so I am
[1:00:08] if then
[1:00:09] if I then your Lord and Master have
[1:00:12] washed your feet ye
[1:00:15] ought also ought to wash one another's
[1:00:18] feet here right here we have the
[1:00:21] Commandment of feet washing unequivocal
[1:00:25] absolute he said to do it
[1:00:31] imagine how uncomfortable this was for
[1:00:34] Jesus knowing what the rest of the day
[1:00:36] the rest of the evening held for him
[1:00:39] kneeling down and washing his disciples
[1:00:42] feet knowing in his mind that there
[1:00:45] Judas why he left and who's coming to
[1:00:49] get me and knowing that I am going to be
[1:00:51] stretched out on the cross tomorrow
[1:00:54] and yet he did this
[1:00:57] for his disciples he explained to them
[1:01:00] how important was was this to him that
[1:01:03] he would explain to them this is what
[1:01:06] you need to do in the future
[1:01:13] he says this
[1:01:15] for I have given you an example
[1:01:18] that you should do as I have done unto
[1:01:21] you
[1:01:22] he gave us an example of healing and we
[1:01:24] all believe that he gave us an example
[1:01:25] of Salvation we all believe that he gave
[1:01:28] us an example of Mercy we all believe
[1:01:30] that and he gave us an example of feet
[1:01:32] washing and we should all believe that
[1:01:35] also
[1:01:36] verily verily I say unto you the servant
[1:01:39] is not greater than his Lord neither is
[1:01:42] neither he that is sent greater than him
[1:01:45] that's than he that sent him if ye know
[1:01:48] these things happy are ye
[1:01:51] if you do them
[1:01:54] we're all happy when we understand what
[1:01:57] communion and feet washing the
[1:01:59] ordinances are about so we've seen that
[1:02:02] that Jesus gave the prophecy here of of
[1:02:05] eating my flesh and drinking my blood we
[1:02:08] see that
[1:02:09] he has his disciples there and he he
[1:02:12] serves them bread and he washes their
[1:02:15] feet and and he tells them to do this
[1:02:18] again then Jesus and his disciples he
[1:02:21] said he says let's go
[1:02:23] so they're sitting there they all they
[1:02:25] all get up they walk down the side of
[1:02:27] the mountain into the Kidron Valley they
[1:02:29] they and as they're going down he's
[1:02:32] teaching them and he's and they get down
[1:02:35] to the bottom and he says okay let's
[1:02:37] stand let's pray that we're all together
[1:02:39] and then he he asked the Lord Lord may
[1:02:43] they be one
[1:02:45] As We Are One
[1:02:47] I've preached about this many times it's
[1:02:49] one of the most special things in the
[1:02:52] whole Bible to me is when Jesus said
[1:02:55] Lord
[1:02:57] my father
[1:02:59] may my disciples may my people be so
[1:03:04] fitly joined together that they may be
[1:03:08] as close as you and I are
[1:03:12] may they have such communion among
[1:03:14] themselves may they be so close that
[1:03:17] they are as close as the father and of
[1:03:20] the son Lord may they be one
[1:03:24] and may the world know
[1:03:27] that I am your Messiah by their love one
[1:03:31] for another
[1:03:34] that there's Jesus and there's his last
[1:03:36] prayer that he prays over his disciples
[1:03:38] and he's talking about how they should
[1:03:41] commune with one another they should
[1:03:42] love one another right after we see the
[1:03:45] communion how important are these
[1:03:48] ordinances that we are going to take
[1:03:49] next week
[1:03:51] how we should be prepared for these
[1:03:53] things this is it's vital
[1:03:57] so much so that the last thing he does
[1:04:01] with his disciples
[1:04:03] they eat this communion their feet wash
[1:04:06] they go down and then he prays Lord may
[1:04:09] they be one
[1:04:11] may they be together
[1:04:13] then we see in the book of Acts we see
[1:04:16] that
[1:04:17] it's probably it looks like brother
[1:04:20] Wilson you're a scholar it looks to me
[1:04:23] like
[1:04:24] they took the the communion they took
[1:04:28] the the ordinances every time they came
[1:04:31] together they broke bread it seems like
[1:04:33] that it was so important that they had
[1:04:36] to be so ready
[1:04:39] to take this every time they had they
[1:04:41] came together first Corinthians chapter
[1:04:43] 11. very familiar scripture wonderful
[1:04:47] scripture with the communion says this
[1:04:57] let's start with verse 20.
[1:05:02] sorry
[1:05:03] brother Kevin but if I messed you up on
[1:05:05] my scriptures verse 20.
[1:05:07] when you come together
[1:05:09] therefore in one place this is not to
[1:05:13] eat the Lord's Supper
[1:05:15] for in eating everyone taketh before
[1:05:17] other his own supper and one is hungry
[1:05:21] and the other is drunk and he's saying
[1:05:23] that that some people get there earlier
[1:05:25] some people want their food quick you
[1:05:26] know the others might be slow this is
[1:05:29] this is what you do at home
[1:05:31] he's like this is not this church is not
[1:05:35] a place to eat a meal
[1:05:37] when we're coming in here this isn't
[1:05:39] this isn't to to eat burgers and fries
[1:05:43] this is something that is meant for
[1:05:45] something else
[1:05:49] what have you not houses to eat and to
[1:05:52] drink in or despise ye the Church of God
[1:05:54] and shame them that have not what shall
[1:05:57] I say to you shall I Praise You In This
[1:06:00] I praise you not for I have received
[1:06:04] of the Lord that which also I delivered
[1:06:08] unto you that the Lord Jesus the same
[1:06:11] night
[1:06:13] in which he was betrayed took bread now
[1:06:16] Paul is moving into here are the
[1:06:21] ordinances
[1:06:26] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:06:30] and said take eat this is my body which
[1:06:34] is broken for you
[1:06:36] and this do and do this and this do in
[1:06:40] remembrance of me
[1:06:41] again
[1:06:43] the Apostle is teaching that Christ's
[1:06:45] body was broken for us
[1:06:48] that's why we see when you see the bread
[1:06:52] being passed and you see the plate
[1:06:55] you see the the the bread that's in
[1:06:58] there it's broken it's not a wafer
[1:07:01] you know that's that's like perfectly
[1:07:03] formed it's not it's broken pieces of
[1:07:06] bread it's very important that part of
[1:07:09] it is because it shows that Jesus I know
[1:07:12] his bones were broken but his body was
[1:07:14] broken he was hurt very very badly
[1:07:18] and and it and it we have this plate of
[1:07:23] bread that's that's broken and it's torn
[1:07:26] up and it represents Jesus if we have if
[1:07:30] we have something that is perfectly
[1:07:32] formed like round
[1:07:35] that that again like cane he's like you
[1:07:37] messed it all up
[1:07:40] Kane it's this this these this sacrifice
[1:07:44] it's not flowers and fruit it's blood
[1:07:47] and it's the same thing how they mess up
[1:07:50] the ordinances of God this needs to be
[1:07:53] broken or it's not it doesn't make sense
[1:07:56] if this represents his body it is a
[1:08:00] broken body are you with me
[1:08:03] it's it's it's important these little
[1:08:05] things if we miss these little things
[1:08:08] then we we can mess up the whole Plan of
[1:08:11] Salvation brother Nicholas it it messes
[1:08:13] it all up it's good to see you my friend
[1:08:18] Isaiah chapter 53 let's let's shift
[1:08:20] gears right here and talk about the
[1:08:22] Lord's broken body it's a familiar
[1:08:24] scripture but I think it would be good
[1:08:25] if we read it again Isaiah 53 let's
[1:08:29] start with verse 1.
[1:08:32] who hath believed our report
[1:08:34] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[1:08:36] revealed for he shall grow up before him
[1:08:39] his prophesying of the Messiah
[1:08:42] for he shall grow up before him as a
[1:08:44] tender plant and as the root out of a
[1:08:47] dry ground he hath no form or comeliness
[1:08:50] and when we shall see him there is no
[1:08:53] beauty that we should desire him
[1:08:56] he is despised and rejected of men a Man
[1:09:00] of Sorrows and acquainted with grief
[1:09:03] and we hid as it were our faces from him
[1:09:05] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[1:09:09] surely he hath borne our griefs and
[1:09:13] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[1:09:16] him stricken
[1:09:18] smitten of God and afflicted
[1:09:22] but he was wounded for our
[1:09:25] transgressions
[1:09:26] he was bruised for our iniquities the
[1:09:30] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:09:33] and with his stripes we are healed a
[1:09:37] broken body
[1:09:39] broken bread in the plate Jesus said eat
[1:09:45] my flesh drink my blood it has to be
[1:09:48] broken
[1:09:52] all we like sheep have gone astray we
[1:09:54] have turned every one to his own way and
[1:09:57] the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity
[1:09:59] of us all later in Christ our iniquity
[1:10:04] he was oppressed and he was afflicted
[1:10:06] yet he opened not his mouth he is
[1:10:09] brought as a lamb to the slaughter and
[1:10:12] as a sheep before her shears is dumb so
[1:10:16] he opened not his mouth
[1:10:18] he was taken from prison and from
[1:10:21] judgment and who shall declare his
[1:10:24] generation for he was cut off out of the
[1:10:27] land of the living for the transgression
[1:10:29] of my people was he stricken and he made
[1:10:32] his grave with the wicked
[1:10:36] he was killed on the cross with sinners
[1:10:40] and with the rich in his death he was
[1:10:43] put in the grave by the donation of a
[1:10:45] rich man
[1:10:47] because he had done no violence neither
[1:10:50] was there any deceit in his mouth yet it
[1:10:52] pleased the Lord to bruise him
[1:10:56] he hath put
[1:10:58] him to grief
[1:11:01] when thou shalt make his soul an
[1:11:03] offering for sin
[1:11:05] he shall see his seed he shall prolong
[1:11:09] his days and the pleasure of the Lord
[1:11:11] shall prosper in his hand
[1:11:14] he shall see the travail of his soul and
[1:11:18] shall be satisfied by his knowledge
[1:11:20] shall my righteousness my righteous
[1:11:23] servant justify many for he shall bear
[1:11:26] their iniquities therefore I will divide
[1:11:29] him a portion with the great and he
[1:11:32] shall divide the spoil with the strong
[1:11:34] because he hath poured out his soul unto
[1:11:38] death
[1:11:39] and he was numbered with the
[1:11:41] transgressors on the cross with the two
[1:11:44] others and he bear the sin of many and
[1:11:48] made intercession for the transgression
[1:11:51] transgressors
[1:11:53] there is that broken body that will pass
[1:11:57] before us next weekend
[1:12:00] that is what's coming that is what that
[1:12:02] represents it should be a solemn fearful
[1:12:06] time when that bread passes by and that
[1:12:11] wine that represents his blood comes
[1:12:14] before us
[1:12:16] back to First Corinthians 11 please
[1:12:21] and after the same manner
[1:12:24] also he took the cup
[1:12:26] and we had stopped saying this cup is
[1:12:28] the New Testament in my blood this do ye
[1:12:30] is often as ye drink it in remembrance
[1:12:32] of me
[1:12:35] for as often as ye eat this bread and
[1:12:37] drink this cup you do know the Lord's
[1:12:40] death till he come
[1:12:42] I've heard people say brother Aaron and
[1:12:45] I was just discussing it in the back
[1:12:46] I've heard people say that we don't need
[1:12:48] to take communion anymore
[1:12:51] this shows that we need to observe these
[1:12:54] ordinances until he returns
[1:12:57] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:13:00] and drink this
[1:13:02] cup of the Lord unworthily shall be
[1:13:05] guilty of the body and the blood of the
[1:13:08] Lord
[1:13:09] that is why I am preaching this with a
[1:13:12] weak
[1:13:13] to go before the communion service
[1:13:16] I want to make sure all of us are taking
[1:13:19] this in reverence all of us have some
[1:13:22] time to make things right all of us have
[1:13:25] time to pray about this I want to take
[1:13:29] this seriously because you see here this
[1:13:32] is a serious thing if you believe this
[1:13:34] word
[1:13:35] if this book means something this is a
[1:13:38] serious serious time
[1:13:45] but let a man examine himself
[1:13:48] and so let him eat of the bread and
[1:13:51] drink of that cup
[1:13:54] friends I think communion should be
[1:13:56] taken often
[1:13:59] not
[1:14:01] maybe put off too long because it does
[1:14:06] make us examine ourselves it makes us
[1:14:09] check up I know even in my life in
[1:14:12] growing up if I knew that there was a
[1:14:14] communion service coming up I thought I
[1:14:16] better straighten up
[1:14:18] I'd better I'd better you know I better
[1:14:21] stop doing this or stop doing this that
[1:14:24] and and maybe get on my knees and say
[1:14:26] Lord I'm sorry
[1:14:27] Lord wipe this Sin from me I'm a sinner
[1:14:30] I messed up
[1:14:31] but I want to be right when I walk up
[1:14:33] there to that Kate that table
[1:14:38] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:14:40] unworthily eateth and drink his
[1:14:42] damnation to himself
[1:14:45] for not Discerning the Lord's body
[1:14:48] we see we heard it about feet washing
[1:14:51] the Lord Jesus said now we're hearing
[1:14:54] about the bread
[1:14:57] the Amplified version of that scripture
[1:14:59] another translation says this anyone who
[1:15:02] eats and drinks without solemn reverence
[1:15:05] and heartfelt gratitude for the
[1:15:09] sacrifice of Christ eats and drinks
[1:15:12] judgment on himself
[1:15:14] if he does not recognize the body of
[1:15:17] Christ
[1:15:18] verse 30. for this cause many are weak
[1:15:21] and sickly among you and many sleep
[1:15:24] again that same translation the
[1:15:26] Amplified version of the Bible which
[1:15:28] which attempts to clarify some things it
[1:15:32] has inserts in there trying to
[1:15:35] lay the foundation
[1:15:37] the Amplified version says this that the
[1:15:40] careless and worthy participation is the
[1:15:44] reason why many of you are weak and sick
[1:15:48] and a number of you sleep in death
[1:15:51] basically Paul is telling us here that
[1:15:54] to take these things seriously your life
[1:15:57] or the life of others
[1:16:00] might be on the line
[1:16:02] when people come through by the LIE when
[1:16:04] we lay our hands on them to pray for
[1:16:05] them
[1:16:06] it's their life on the line now
[1:16:09] and all of us when you sisters when you
[1:16:12] when you come
[1:16:13] to The Altar and you pray with each
[1:16:15] other
[1:16:16] think of what that person's praying for
[1:16:19] and think about what's on the line it
[1:16:21] may be a sick loved one that could be
[1:16:24] lost in death
[1:16:27] who knows what it is but it's serious
[1:16:29] that we have to be ready
[1:16:31] for these things if I'm gonna lay my
[1:16:33] hands on someone these unworthy hands I
[1:16:37] wanted them to be as good as they can I
[1:16:40] want to I want to make sure I'm doing
[1:16:41] everything that I can to represent our
[1:16:44] Lord
[1:16:45] when we are praying for each other like
[1:16:48] I was ministering on this morning
[1:16:51] that we need to pray for one another but
[1:16:54] then we have an obligation we have an
[1:16:56] obligation to be living a life that's
[1:16:59] above reproach so that we are able to
[1:17:02] pray for them so if we're praying for
[1:17:04] someone that sin isn't coming into our
[1:17:06] minds
[1:17:07] as we're trying to pray
[1:17:09] as I always say it's not about me
[1:17:12] it's about the person I'm praying for so
[1:17:15] often we get stuck it's about me it's
[1:17:16] about me and I do this and I do that
[1:17:18] well what about someone else
[1:17:19] what about the person that you are
[1:17:21] laying your hands on
[1:17:24] for if we would judge ourselves
[1:17:27] we should not be judged
[1:17:30] if we recognize our shortcomings and we
[1:17:32] correct our bad behavior then we won't
[1:17:35] be judged
[1:17:37] but then
[1:17:39] verse number 32 but when we are judged
[1:17:42] we are chastened of the Lord that we
[1:17:44] should not be condemned with the world
[1:17:47] when we fall short and we will
[1:17:51] when we fall short
[1:17:54] we are disciplined by our lord Jesus
[1:17:59] amen
[1:18:01] we're disciplined by our lord Jesus so
[1:18:03] that we will not be condemned to Eternal
[1:18:06] punishment along with the world
[1:18:10] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:18:12] together
[1:18:13] to eat Terry one for another
[1:18:18] again this is talking about the Lord's
[1:18:20] Supper it's not talking about having
[1:18:22] dinner together it's talking about
[1:18:24] taking of these ordinances
[1:18:31] and when we are tearing one for another
[1:18:35] also there there some of the things in
[1:18:38] the communion service there may be
[1:18:40] people that need to take communion that
[1:18:46] need to partake in these ordinances but
[1:18:48] are not able to come to the service
[1:18:52] they're not able to get here
[1:18:54] do anything that you can to get here
[1:18:58] but if if there is some reason that
[1:19:01] someone can't come
[1:19:03] then Brothers we need to make sure that
[1:19:06] we go to those people and bring these
[1:19:09] ordinances to the folks that cannot come
[1:19:12] May that maybe they're sick in a
[1:19:14] hospital bed or they're not able to come
[1:19:16] we need to make sure that we make a way
[1:19:19] so that they can take the communion
[1:19:25] verse 34.
[1:19:27] and if that is the case before I go
[1:19:29] before I go on to the next one if that
[1:19:31] is the case make sure you contact one of
[1:19:34] us
[1:19:35] that we can arrange for this to happen
[1:19:37] next weekend
[1:19:40] If any man hunger let him eat at home
[1:19:43] if you come not together unto that if
[1:19:46] you come not together under condemnation
[1:19:49] and the rest will I set in order when I
[1:19:52] come again he's talking about
[1:19:55] taking the communion having the
[1:19:58] ordinances in
[1:20:00] this sanctuary
[1:20:03] and then he says the rest will I set in
[1:20:05] order when I come he's I assume that
[1:20:09] brother Paul is talking about you have
[1:20:11] some other problems
[1:20:13] and when I get there I'll take care of
[1:20:15] those too
[1:20:16] but make sure you're doing this
[1:20:19] this is absolutely vital
[1:20:24] so one of the questions that so often
[1:20:26] comes up
[1:20:27] is who can take communion
[1:20:31] if we all look at ourselves and this is
[1:20:34] something this is a problem that I had
[1:20:36] when I was when I was
[1:20:37] Hunter's age and Daniel's age I I just
[1:20:40] didn't feel there was there was things
[1:20:42] in my life
[1:20:44] that I didn't feel worthy to take the
[1:20:48] communion as I said we can't ride the
[1:20:50] fence
[1:20:52] either I'm lost
[1:20:54] or I'm not
[1:20:57] so we can't ride that fence so if
[1:20:59] there's some sin in our lives what are
[1:21:01] you gonna do
[1:21:03] and as a young man it always troubled me
[1:21:08] that
[1:21:10] there's there's these problems I keep I
[1:21:13] keep messing up I keep doing this wrong
[1:21:15] I keep doing that wrong and and finally
[1:21:17] I believe that the Lord revealed it to
[1:21:19] me that there is a repentance now in me
[1:21:22] that was never there before
[1:21:25] all have sinned and come short of the
[1:21:27] glory of God we all do things wrong
[1:21:31] every day even sister surely does
[1:21:37] but we do we all do things wrong every
[1:21:40] day
[1:21:42] a saint of God does things wrong and a
[1:21:46] vile sinner does things wrong and we
[1:21:48] need the blood of Jesus Christ so as as
[1:21:52] we're going through and the enemy comes
[1:21:55] in and he will
[1:21:56] and he tries to tell you no don't take
[1:21:59] communion
[1:22:00] you can say well
[1:22:03] I'm doing everything that I can
[1:22:05] I sin I messed up I repented
[1:22:10] I I've Lord I felt bad
[1:22:13] for doing it and I've done everything
[1:22:15] that I can to make it right I've prayed
[1:22:17] and and I've asked you for forgiveness
[1:22:19] now if I have faith in the blood of
[1:22:22] Jesus Christ I am forgiven
[1:22:24] and I can stand up here at this platform
[1:22:27] and I can take that bread and that wine
[1:22:30] and I can do it with confidence because
[1:22:31] I know if I don't
[1:22:33] do it
[1:22:35] then I have no part with him
[1:22:38] and with all my sins and everything
[1:22:40] that's about me I want to have a part
[1:22:42] with our lord Jesus
[1:22:45] and
[1:22:46] what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to
[1:22:48] inform
[1:22:49] everyone
[1:22:51] about these so we can prepare as I said
[1:22:53] during the week so that question as I've
[1:22:57] said that question is so common is who
[1:23:01] can take communion
[1:23:03] and I was sharing with uh I think his
[1:23:06] brother Aaron earlier this evening that
[1:23:10] one of the questions was can I take
[1:23:12] communion at home
[1:23:14] with my family with my wife
[1:23:18] and
[1:23:20] the question is a bad question
[1:23:24] it's a bad question because usually
[1:23:29] the answer is because I don't want to
[1:23:33] take communion with them
[1:23:37] no
[1:23:38] the answer is no friends you cannot take
[1:23:42] communion at home
[1:23:44] the whole thing about communion is
[1:23:46] coming together
[1:23:48] and if you if you have if your church is
[1:23:51] split and you're mad at somebody or
[1:23:53] whatever then you better get right
[1:23:55] before you come before this stage here
[1:23:57] and take that bread that's the whole
[1:24:00] reason for it if you're trying to stay
[1:24:03] home and take it at home
[1:24:05] you've missed the whole point of
[1:24:07] communion
[1:24:08] the communion is so that they will be
[1:24:11] together
[1:24:13] and I I quoted the Lord's prayer this
[1:24:16] morning
[1:24:17] Lord forgive me in my trespasses as I
[1:24:19] forgive those who trespass against me
[1:24:23] I want to stand here and I want to take
[1:24:25] this bread I want to be part of that
[1:24:28] broken body
[1:24:29] and if I can't do that with these people
[1:24:33] it's not these people that are wrong
[1:24:36] I don't care if they're Methodist
[1:24:37] Baptist Presbyterian message whatever it
[1:24:41] is
[1:24:42] if you can't take communion with a
[1:24:45] Christian
[1:24:46] what's wrong with you
[1:24:49] what's wrong with me
[1:24:51] if I can't do it
[1:24:53] and that is the question that came on so
[1:24:55] often and the answer is get down to
[1:24:58] church
[1:25:00] and fellowship with those people I don't
[1:25:02] care if you don't agree on the third
[1:25:05] pole or the seven Thunders or whatever
[1:25:07] it is
[1:25:09] this is about Christ
[1:25:11] this is about Jesus this is about his
[1:25:13] broken body his blood that blood
[1:25:17] sacrifice that's what it's about
[1:25:20] let me read a couple quotes here from
[1:25:23] Brother Branham now one thing
[1:25:28] in some in in these questions
[1:25:32] sometimes the only place
[1:25:35] that we have to go
[1:25:37] it's not articulated clear in the Bible
[1:25:40] many things aren't
[1:25:43] so we see that there is something that
[1:25:46] we look to brother Branham for guidance
[1:25:50] on these things
[1:25:52] and that's where we can come together
[1:25:54] it's like well he said this I can't find
[1:25:57] it
[1:25:58] here
[1:26:00] but we can agree on this and it brings
[1:26:02] Unity
[1:26:06] now
[1:26:08] all that wants to stay this is Brother
[1:26:10] Brandon's addressing here who can take
[1:26:13] communion
[1:26:15] now all that wants to stay for communion
[1:26:17] we'd be glad to have you in this time of
[1:26:21] Fellowship
[1:26:22] now you have you have First Corinthians
[1:26:25] I believe the 11th chapter there which I
[1:26:27] just read
[1:26:29] I'll have you read it right now then
[1:26:31] brother Neville if you will but it never
[1:26:33] reads it
[1:26:34] that doesn't need any explaining it's
[1:26:37] just it's just this if we eat and drink
[1:26:39] unworthily we eat and drink damnation to
[1:26:42] our own self not Discerning the Lord's
[1:26:43] body for this cause many are sick many
[1:26:46] are weekly and sick among you and many
[1:26:48] are dead
[1:26:49] when we come to take communion every
[1:26:51] Christian should take communion
[1:26:56] every Christian should take communion
[1:27:00] it's your duty
[1:27:03] it's a showdown
[1:27:05] see Jesus said if you don't take it you
[1:27:08] have no part with me
[1:27:10] see but he that eateth and drinking
[1:27:12] unworthily eats and drinks damnation to
[1:27:14] himself that is if you're still out with
[1:27:17] the world and doing things of the world
[1:27:20] and people see you taking communion
[1:27:22] you're doing wrong
[1:27:24] we're only bringing a disgrace you're
[1:27:26] only bringing a disgrace to you and
[1:27:28] it'll only harm you
[1:27:30] it isn't that it'll harm God it'll harm
[1:27:33] you and so a person should examine
[1:27:36] themselves and before we approach the
[1:27:39] sacred moment you ask God to search my
[1:27:42] life and if I've done anything that's
[1:27:45] not right forgive me for it that's what
[1:27:47] this week is for
[1:27:49] I don't mean to do it I'll make it right
[1:27:53] if he'll reveal it to me and I'll ask
[1:27:56] the same thing for you
[1:27:58] said when you come together Terry one
[1:28:00] for another let's wait on one another
[1:28:03] and pray one for another we want to take
[1:28:06] this communion and if and if we don't do
[1:28:09] it we have no part with him that's what
[1:28:12] he said for or Saint John the sixth
[1:28:14] chapter
[1:28:15] now let's pray you pray for me silently
[1:28:18] why I pray uh then brother bran Whispers
[1:28:21] I pray that the holy spirit of God
[1:28:24] I pray that you'll forgive us for all of
[1:28:27] our trespasses oh Lord hear our prayer
[1:28:29] this is our prayer of forgiveness Lord
[1:28:31] we pray forgiveness we pray for Mercy
[1:28:33] forgive us Lord as it is written in thy
[1:28:36] word forgive us our trespasses
[1:28:39] as we forgive those that trespass
[1:28:41] against us and lead us not into
[1:28:43] temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for
[1:28:46] thine is the kingdom and the power and
[1:28:48] the glory forever amen I did not know
[1:28:51] that that was at the end of that quote
[1:28:52] and I I put that on there
[1:28:57] um
[1:28:59] and I've preached on that this morning I
[1:29:01] didn't know it was just till I read it
[1:29:04] in the next quote
[1:29:06] now we are having coming to the
[1:29:08] communion table and now
[1:29:11] yet there's some that doesn't take
[1:29:13] communion and maybe you just take it
[1:29:17] in their own churches but we'd be happy
[1:29:19] tonight if you could would want to
[1:29:22] fellowship with us around these things
[1:29:27] shows that we can bring others in this
[1:29:29] is not a closed communion
[1:29:35] we never draw any lines of who just as
[1:29:38] long as you're walking worthy of the
[1:29:40] Gospel that that you're listening to and
[1:29:43] confessing to be part of it
[1:29:46] you know you're part of this gospel
[1:29:50] you are written Epistles of what we're
[1:29:52] talking about and as long as we do
[1:29:55] something that's reproachful then we are
[1:29:58] an indentment to what we are listening
[1:30:00] to see we must live what we believe and
[1:30:05] live it in such a way that it will never
[1:30:08] reproach but reflect Jesus in all things
[1:30:11] that we do and say that's
[1:30:16] that's I'm sorry
[1:30:21] I lost my place
[1:30:24] where are we at I love him for and now
[1:30:27] tonight we're going to read no that's
[1:30:29] not the right quote
[1:30:44] well I'll I'll start with what I have in
[1:30:48] um now it's the same quote that I was
[1:30:50] just reading if you live a life that
[1:30:52] proves what you are you want to search
[1:30:54] your heart well let me be sure to
[1:30:56] mention on this that the scripture reads
[1:30:59] here that if we take it unworthily
[1:31:05] now we know that we are not worthy in
[1:31:08] ourselves
[1:31:10] none of us are
[1:31:12] but that we are not trusting in our own
[1:31:14] worthiness we're trusting in Him
[1:31:17] who has we're trusting in his worthiness
[1:31:20] that we have died to our own thinking
[1:31:22] and just think his thoughts and live to
[1:31:25] everything that we believe he commands
[1:31:28] us to do
[1:31:29] and look back and see that we are living
[1:31:32] and look over look our life over and
[1:31:35] we're doing things that not that's not
[1:31:37] worthy of the Gospel then we shouldn't
[1:31:40] take the communion but if we're doing
[1:31:42] the things that we think that our lives
[1:31:45] could be read of all men that if anybody
[1:31:48] could not point a finger and say I seen
[1:31:51] this man in a bar room the other day I
[1:31:53] heard this man stand and tell filthy
[1:31:55] jokes this woman doing wrong then if you
[1:31:59] know that that's the Holy Spirit
[1:32:01] pointing to you then don't take
[1:32:04] communion
[1:32:05] but if you feel that you're living that
[1:32:09] you look back and see that all your sins
[1:32:12] are confessed and under the blood
[1:32:15] then you're supposed to take it and
[1:32:18] you're part of it
[1:32:20] and we see
[1:32:23] as I said you can't ride the fence on
[1:32:25] this one
[1:32:26] you either take it or you don't take it
[1:32:29] if you take it unworthily you're guilty
[1:32:32] if you don't take it you're guilty there
[1:32:35] is only one way to do it and that is
[1:32:39] make things right that is live according
[1:32:42] to this gospel as as we approach this
[1:32:46] day
[1:32:48] as far as the wine the kind of wine that
[1:32:52] we use
[1:32:53] I know that there's a lot of kind of
[1:32:55] dogmas
[1:32:57] not bad dogmas but there's there's a lot
[1:33:00] of things that we do in brother brahm's
[1:33:02] message and um
[1:33:04] my brother Adam made the wine for the
[1:33:08] Branham Tabernacle in Jeffersonville and
[1:33:10] he was very very careful he was very
[1:33:13] sterile in everything that he did and
[1:33:15] and everything was done just perfectly
[1:33:18] so that this wine
[1:33:21] wouldn't make people sick it wouldn't it
[1:33:23] wouldn't be made wrong that it would be
[1:33:25] made in the right way and then it was
[1:33:28] bottled for um for the Bram Tabernacle
[1:33:32] um but because we don't want to drink
[1:33:35] spoiled wine we don't want to drink wine
[1:33:37] that's turned to vinegar
[1:33:39] so now for now we will be using the
[1:33:43] store-bought wine this this weekend
[1:33:45] which is most what most churches do
[1:33:49] that store-bought wine the brand that
[1:33:52] again this is it doesn't have to be this
[1:33:54] way but the brand that brother Branham
[1:33:57] used was
[1:33:58] um a sweet wine called Mogan David and
[1:34:01] it's it's a kosher wine and I found a
[1:34:05] couple quotes where brother Branham said
[1:34:07] that he used a kosher wine
[1:34:09] kosher meaning I assume that it's it's
[1:34:12] overseen by uh some Jewish traditions
[1:34:16] so this weekend we will be using the
[1:34:19] same now we may change that in the
[1:34:21] future
[1:34:21] but this weekend we'll be using the
[1:34:24] traditional approach which is using the
[1:34:27] the kosher wine the the Mogan David
[1:34:31] and one thing I have not been able to
[1:34:32] find in the scriptures or in brother
[1:34:35] Brown's message is that who as far as
[1:34:38] baptism
[1:34:40] who can take communion now I've heard
[1:34:44] many many times people have told me that
[1:34:46] well you can't take communion unless
[1:34:47] you've been baptized
[1:34:49] I can't find it
[1:34:52] and brother Brown's message and I can't
[1:34:54] find it in the scripture but the
[1:34:56] question would come up why do you want
[1:34:58] to take communion if you haven't been
[1:35:00] baptized
[1:35:01] when you want to get baptized if you
[1:35:04] feel that you want to partake in the
[1:35:06] body of Christ then I would highly
[1:35:08] recommend being baptized because that's
[1:35:10] what he's said to do
[1:35:13] um
[1:35:17] and the feet washing
[1:35:19] again in my opinion the the feet washing
[1:35:23] and then the question may be well how
[1:35:26] about feet washing if we haven't been
[1:35:28] baptized we don't take communion can we
[1:35:30] do feet washing I would say the same
[1:35:33] I would say well I can't I don't have a
[1:35:36] scripture forbidding it or a quote but
[1:35:39] don't you think that you'd want to get
[1:35:41] baptized first
[1:35:43] before you do any of these things
[1:35:46] and
[1:35:47] if uh if the if the sisters come if the
[1:35:50] musicians come brother and I'll have
[1:35:52] I'll have you close
[1:35:54] again
[1:35:56] use this week
[1:35:58] in preparation
[1:36:00] for the communion this Sunday and if you
[1:36:03] have any this next Sunday if you have
[1:36:05] any questions for me or for any any of
[1:36:08] us you can you can write in the email at
[1:36:10] pastor at brandometabernacle.com you can
[1:36:13] text me I want to make sure that I'm
[1:36:15] available to answer these questions and
[1:36:19] there's many many I I've seen many
[1:36:21] questions probably the most common
[1:36:24] questions are about communion
[1:36:26] who can take it how do we do it one of
[1:36:29] the ones that I said was was can we take
[1:36:31] it at home
[1:36:33] and not with the Believers well I think
[1:36:37] if you were in Greenland and there was
[1:36:40] nobody there then maybe yeah probably
[1:36:44] but that's not a question that affects
[1:36:47] us
[1:36:49] here we want to come together
[1:36:51] and I also want to remind mind everyone
[1:36:55] if there's someone who is part
[1:36:59] of this congregation or really someone
[1:37:02] that just needs it is not able to get
[1:37:04] out of the hospital or whatever we'll do
[1:37:07] our best to bring that communion to them
[1:37:10] bring the ordinances
[1:37:12] and make it uh as right according to
[1:37:17] this blessed book as we can let's stand
[1:37:20] God bless you all I pray that some of
[1:37:23] the things that I said
[1:37:26] I pray that
[1:37:29] they answered your question and they
[1:37:32] showed you how important
[1:37:34] this communion is what that wine
[1:37:37] represents the blood of Christ what
[1:37:40] those broken pieces of bread represent
[1:37:43] and how Cain
[1:37:46] he just didn't want to do it in his
[1:37:50] stubbornness
[1:37:51] but Abel had the revelation we have the
[1:37:56] Revelation according to the Bible
[1:38:00] and don't take it lightly
[1:38:04] this is a serious thing
[1:38:07] is going to happen
[1:38:09] this this weekend brother Nicholas I'm
[1:38:11] going to have you close in a in a minute
[1:38:14] brother and if you could lead us a
[1:38:15] couple in a couple songs my brother
[1:38:24] did for our transgressions
[1:38:30] okay
[1:38:31] [Music]
[1:38:39] [Music]
[1:38:42] our
[1:38:44] transgression
[1:38:48] he was broke
[1:38:51] for
[1:38:52] our iniquity
[1:38:59] surely
[1:39:00] [Music]
[1:39:02] for our sorrows
[1:39:08] and by his stripes that first verse
[1:39:17] on the cross crucify
[1:39:22] in great sorrow
[1:39:25] he does
[1:39:28] The Giver of Life
[1:39:37] yet my Lord was dismissed and rejected
[1:39:45] [Music]
[1:39:47] this Jesus
[1:39:50] of God glory
[1:39:56] he was
[1:39:59] wounded for
[1:40:01] our
[1:40:03] transgressions
[1:40:06] he was bruised for our iniquity
[1:40:12] [Music]
[1:40:16] show surely
[1:40:18] [Music]
[1:40:20] our
[1:40:23] sorrows
[1:40:25] and by his stripes we
[1:40:31] [Music]
[1:40:35] this afternoon I was listening to
[1:40:37] questions answers in 64. the second
[1:40:40] service
[1:40:42] and a sister wrote to brother Branham
[1:40:44] and she said
[1:40:45] I did this and this that was wrong and I
[1:40:48] made it right with my husband
[1:40:51] she's he said and I also went back to
[1:40:54] the person I did that's when it made
[1:40:55] that right
[1:40:58] and she says now she asked the question
[1:41:01] does he need to do this
[1:41:04] and maybe you could go and listen to
[1:41:06] this yourself because there's two
[1:41:08] definite examples
[1:41:10] and brother bam told her you have done
[1:41:12] everything right
[1:41:14] that you needed to do you made it right
[1:41:16] with your husband you made it right with
[1:41:18] the other one and you made it right with
[1:41:21] God
[1:41:22] so you're free you're clear
[1:41:25] another one see that he talked with she
[1:41:28] said don't tell my husband
[1:41:31] [Music]
[1:41:34] he said now you're guilty of it still
[1:41:36] until you make it right
[1:41:39] that's right I've shared this with you
[1:41:41] and maybe this will help somebody today
[1:41:43] and that is We snuck into Old Tucson
[1:41:46] a group of us Brothers
[1:41:49] and when communia would come
[1:41:52] it would come to mind
[1:41:54] and I would take commune anyway but as
[1:41:56] guilty as could be because I could not
[1:41:58] get
[1:42:00] so they announced communion again and I
[1:42:02] said I know how to take care of this
[1:42:04] go back to Old Tucson and tell them I
[1:42:07] snuck in and pay what I had done for
[1:42:12] so we did that
[1:42:14] it shocked the young lady that was
[1:42:16] receiving
[1:42:18] tickets she didn't know what it had she
[1:42:19] handed me another ticket I said no I've
[1:42:22] already I'm just paying for
[1:42:25] we went ahead communion that night and
[1:42:27] it never troubled me again because it
[1:42:29] was taken care of was it worth it every
[1:42:32] bit of it
[1:42:34] so as quick as you can you say I'm sorry
[1:42:37] amen I didn't mean to do that
[1:42:39] I place it under the blood
[1:42:42] it's it's it's it's really a simple
[1:42:45] thing
[1:42:46] if you just do what God Said but if you
[1:42:48] would go back and read it it's just
[1:42:50] about five minutes longer listen
[1:42:52] two instances that would show you both
[1:42:53] sides
[1:42:54] a second service the evening service of
[1:42:58] questions answered in 64.
[1:43:00] and Brother Band says
[1:43:02] God is allowed these things to happen so
[1:43:05] you and I would have that opportunity to
[1:43:07] say that answers that question
[1:43:10] and I love him for that as our brother
[1:43:12] Castillo comes up we'll sing that one
[1:43:14] more
[1:43:15] he was wound
[1:43:17] it for our transgression
