[21:17] enough to say I just want to thank him I
[21:19] just want to love him I Just Want To
[21:20] Praise Him amen our sister Rebecca Z
[21:23] Brun in his ass and said many prayer
[21:26] unspoken prayer requests
[21:29] there's probably not one of us that
[21:30] would say the same thing oh Lord every
[21:33] moment and every day I need your help
[21:36] our brother Glenn tambling son is as you
[21:39] heard him brother Jordan and the family
[21:41] are are with him and uh they took him up
[21:46] to the hospital I believe it was in
[21:49] Phoenix and U he had some internal
[21:52] bleeding
[21:53] and he let brother Daniel uh Lo know
[21:57] last night that he's doing much
[21:59] better they uh did a procedure on him
[22:02] and they were able to remove some of the
[22:05] obstructions but he did ask to remember
[22:07] in prayer as they done the biopsy to
[22:11] what the results would be
[22:14] so and then yesterday my daughter Sarah
[22:17] had gone in for dialysis and she had
[22:20] skipped one day CU she wasn't feeling
[22:22] well and she was carrying about 5 kilos
[22:25] of
[22:26] water that that's a lot of extra water
[22:29] to have in your body and and that what
[22:31] that water fills all the voids in your
[22:34] body it gets in between your lungs and
[22:35] all and gets hard to sleep and all so
[22:39] she went in and the port had a leak in
[22:42] it an air bubble and they couldn't find
[22:45] and it's dangerous because if you get
[22:46] the air bubble into your blood system it
[22:48] could be very
[22:49] serious so she came to the house early
[22:53] afternoon around 3:00 and she said I've
[22:55] got to go to the hospital over to St
[22:56] Mary's they've got got to find the
[22:58] problem so my wife and her went and
[23:03] um they weren't able to see her for
[23:06] about 5 hours because it was so busy and
[23:09] they only had one
[23:10] doctor thank you and um it's a cold time
[23:15] of the the year and the homeless people
[23:17] they come they walk into the hospital CU
[23:20] they get some attention so was quite
[23:23] busy so around 11 11:00 she was able to
[23:26] be seen and they couldn't find where the
[23:29] leak was from what was causing that and
[23:32] just one of the text one of the guys
[23:34] there he was there and he goes wait a
[23:35] minute I think I see something and she
[23:37] had called and they had called in and
[23:39] said can you pray that that they would
[23:41] find this and we were in prayer for
[23:43] it and on the outer section of the of
[23:46] the port they found a small crack and he
[23:49] just happened to notice it but I know
[23:51] who was watching over it's is just a
[23:54] minute little
[23:56] crack
[24:00] so they were able to work on
[24:03] her and this is going on between 1 and
[24:06] 4:00 in the
[24:07] morning and so she was texting us and as
[24:11] they're prepared to give her treatment
[24:13] and and work it and put the temporary
[24:16] port in they have to give her medicines
[24:19] and she began to vomit she couldn't stop
[24:21] and so she's texting us and we're
[24:23] praying and I was listening to a message
[24:26] and brother random says God likes to do
[24:29] things at the last
[24:31] moment now you and I don't like it
[24:34] sometimes where are you Lord but he
[24:37] knows what he's doing and I was just
[24:40] listening to that so I sent him that
[24:41] portion of the quote I said just trust
[24:45] in God he will be there so they were
[24:48] able to get that resolved she should be
[24:50] in the hospital for about an a a week
[24:53] taking care of her but this morning she
[24:55] not a month a a week so
[24:58] I appreciate God being merciful and if
[25:01] you have a request you raise your hand
[25:03] and say Lord remember
[25:05] me sometimes you can't put it into words
[25:07] but you know you have a need of some

[48:49] for that little touch that you gave us
[48:51] this morning as your spirit came down
[48:53] and singing that blessed old song May
[48:55] maybe
[48:56] 3,500 years old it was originally sang

[49:02] Psalm 34 Lord how great it is and how
[49:06] great you are father we thank you and we
[49:09] ask Lord that you would bless this
[49:10] service this morning be with us father

[49:18] it all be pleasing to you Lord in Jesus
[49:22] Christ's name amen amen God bless you
[49:26] you can be
[49:33] seated yes
[49:38] sir I feel like I could just yell it
[49:41] out
[49:43] today how how precious is the Lord Jesus
[49:47] don't you just love to worship him
[49:50] there's a story do you know the king you
[49:53] know who the king Jehoshaphat is you
[49:55] know the story about Ahab and
[49:57] Jehoshaphat Jehoshaphat was a Godly King
[50:00] Jehoshaphat Was preparing to go to
[50:02] battle he was the king of Judah he was
[50:05] preparing to go to battle against an
[50:08] insurmountable Force Jehosaphat got his
[50:12] people together and the Bible says in
[50:14] first second 1st Chronicles chapter 20 I
[50:17] believe it is that he got his people
[50:19] together and he consulted the people yes
[50:21] sir and then he
[50:23] took his Warriors and all of his men of
[50:26] battle but he didn't send them to battle
[50:30] you know what he did he sent out the
[50:32] worshippers first and these worshippers
[50:36] went out and they went out praising the
[50:38] Lord like we're doing and and praising
[50:41] and singing praises to the Lord and and
[50:44] worshiping and praying and they went out
[50:46] and then this great insurmountable Force
[50:49] as they came down to attack Judah there
[50:53] were people laying in weit that no one
[50:55] knew were there ambushed all of these
[51:00] these this great Army and they fought
[51:04] and destroyed this Army that was coming
[51:06] against Judah and there the worshippers
[51:08] are worshiping praising the Lord and
[51:11] then after that these these ambushers
[51:14] they were still not God's people they
[51:16] after they came out and conquered the
[51:18] the the
[51:19] Army then they turned on themselves and
[51:23] they started fighting and they killed
[51:25] themselves so Jehoshaphat goes out with
[51:27] his
[51:29] Warriors and they look
[51:31] out and it was all dead
[51:35] people all from the worshippers yes sir
[51:39] that went forth so how important is our
[51:42] worship to the
[51:45] Lord amen you know in the Book of
[51:48] Revelation we talk about the different
[51:51] ages in Revelation 2 and 3 there is one
[51:54] thing in common that each age has and
[51:56] that is to them that
[51:58] overcome and we overcome by the blood of
[52:01] the lamb and the strength of Our
[52:02] Testimony and the word of Our Testimony
[52:05] and that's what we are here today we are
[52:06] here to overcome the enemy and there is
[52:10] prophesied a group of people brother
[52:12] Paul that will overcome and I'm among
[52:14] those people you know what I'm among
[52:16] those people today in this
[52:21] room I guess I'd better turn my computer
[52:24] on get my notes
[52:28] Here I just thankful just so thankful we
[52:32] have we have a special honor
[52:35] today we're going to have our our church
[52:39] election I um I believe it's very very
[52:42] important and I believe it's
[52:46] important we can't really find many
[52:49] elections that are in the
[52:52] Bible
[52:54] but brother brandham set a
[52:57] precedence with an election in his
[52:59] church we are a sovereign church but we
[53:02] are following his leadership in doing
[53:07] this I read this quote on Wednesday
[53:09] night I wantan I want to read it again
[53:12] this this blessed me it's from it's 1958
[53:17] and I think just after that is when my
[53:21] grandfather Carl wheeler was elected to
[53:23] the office of deacon
[53:25] and it says this it says now I want to
[53:29] say
[53:30] too I see brother
[53:32] Egan and many of the trustees sitting
[53:35] here after we had our trustee meeting
[53:38] the other
[53:39] night it is true I publicly before the
[53:43] church that each one of you are no
[53:46] longer appointed
[53:48] trustees you are elected trustees and
[53:52] your name is on the books all right and
[53:55] now if they're going to have some more
[53:57] elections now they're going to have some
[53:59] more elections of deacons and so forth
[54:01] and brother Neville is will be calling
[54:03] those immediately after service all
[54:05] right and for the treasurer and so forth
[54:07] as we get the church set
[54:11] up get all remember the church was set
[54:14] up in
[54:15] 1933 this is in 1958 brother brandom is
[54:19] saying this so they're setting up the
[54:21] church again they're rededicating this
[54:23] they're move forward they're moving
[54:24] forward again again as we set the church
[54:28] up get it all backgrounds ready then we
[54:32] can have a Revival as it comes
[54:35] on how important are the little things
[54:39] things that we might not think are very
[54:40] important but they are important to
[54:44] God just like brother Josiah just like
[54:46] sending out those
[54:48] worshippers before
[54:51] Judah God it was important to him to be
[54:54] wor
[54:55] woried and the whole they conquered the
[54:58] whole the whole armies against him and
[55:00] they didn't lift a
[55:03] sword these things are important and we
[55:07] need to make sure that we are lining
[55:09] everything up that we can doing our best
[55:13] Lord just to fall
[55:15] into um compliance or into obedience to
[55:19] your word and doing our best not only
[55:23] here in church but in our homes and in
[55:26] our jobs and everywhere that that we're
[55:30] we go to and every person that we see we
[55:33] want to make sure that we are
[55:35] representing Jesus Christ in everything
[55:37] that we
[55:38] do um I I do want to make a couple
[55:41] announcements um we are going on a trip

[56:44] Believers and converts in in that
[56:46] country of Uganda and this material
[56:50] brother Caleb Perez in Las cruus has
[56:53] been a very very big part part of that

[57:38] later a little bit later
[57:40] on
[57:43] um these
[57:45] things are
[57:47] important we might not
[57:50] think
[57:52] that they matter that much much but as I
[57:55] said they matter to God our music and
[57:59] the worship it matters to him it's
[58:03] important renovating the church as we're
[58:06] about to start doing it matters it's
[58:09] important when people come into this
[58:12] church they need to be be made made to
[58:15] feel welcome and as they look around
[58:20] this church represents not us but it
[58:24] represents Jesus
[58:26] Christ and the feeling that they come
[58:29] that they walk in and they're they're
[58:31] greeted with it's important you may not
[58:34] think it's important it might not come
[58:36] into your mind but these things are
[58:38] important to God
[58:40] everything in this election that we have
[58:44] that we have today these
[58:48] brothers that I have nominated for these
[58:52] positions I believe that
[58:55] they they hold a very very important
[58:58] part of this of this service of this
[59:01] church brother Lyall and I was talking
[59:03] with the brothers out here just before
[59:05] we started and brother Lyle of course
[59:08] all the brothers are like brother I
[59:09] don't I don't feel
[59:10] worthy as we've talked a lot about this
[59:13] and how important these positions are
[59:15] and they say brother I don't really feel
[59:17] worthy to do it and and it's like I
[59:21] agree you're you're really
[59:23] not
[59:26] but it's an obligation brother Lyall was
[59:30] telling me he says well he says having
[59:31] this
[59:33] position he
[59:35] says in other words that now he's
[59:38] obligated and before he did it in his
[59:41] heart and he told me he says brother
[59:42] Daniel I'd do it no matter what but now
[59:45] there is an obligation there is an
[59:48] official position that they
[59:51] hold that is subject to to the people in
[59:56] serving all of us as a
[59:59] congregation when we see a
[1:00:04] church that the pastor is just for lack
[1:00:08] of a better word a dictator and I don't
[1:00:11] mean that necessarily always in a wrong
[1:00:14] term but someone that just has ultimate
[1:00:16] control over everything when you see
[1:00:19] that and the pastor's making all the
[1:00:21] decisions and all the financial
[1:00:22] decisions and and all of the spirit
[1:00:24] spiritual decisions and everything goes
[1:00:26] through the pastor and he takes all of
[1:00:29] that on
[1:00:30] himself often it results in a lazy
[1:00:34] congregation because they're relying on
[1:00:36] the pastor's walk with the Lord to make
[1:00:39] all of the decisions and that's not
[1:00:41] that's not the way the Lord set it up
[1:00:43] it's not the way it was set up in the
[1:00:44] book of Acts in the book of Acts you
[1:00:46] don't see one
[1:00:47] leader you see churches forming and you
[1:00:50] see people like Timothy it wasn't just
[1:00:53] Paul it was wasn't just Peter fact James
[1:00:56] was the pastor of the church in
[1:00:59] Jerusalem and you have all of these
[1:01:01] different Brothers doing different works
[1:01:03] and everyone had their own
[1:01:05] responsibility and that's how a body is
[1:01:08] all of us have a responsibility I heard
[1:01:11] a sister a couple sisters have come to
[1:01:13] me before with concerns and they have
[1:01:16] made the statement that they say brother
[1:01:18] Daniel I know I'm just a woman but don't
[1:01:22] ever say something like that
[1:01:26] a sister has a just as much of an
[1:01:29] important
[1:01:31] role in all of this it's just
[1:01:34] different it's just in not a position of
[1:01:39] authority
[1:01:41] sisters our children would not be good
[1:01:45] kids if it wasn't for
[1:01:47] Mama and that's how almost always there
[1:01:50] are exceptions of course but a good
[1:01:53] mother is the most important thing to a
[1:01:57] child and the sisters have roles in
[1:01:58] churches in this church also very very
[1:02:01] important roles I was talking with
[1:02:02] sister Elizabeth back there in the back
[1:02:04] and talking about how much she does just
[1:02:07] for people that you don't see giving
[1:02:10] rides to people helping people helping
[1:02:14] feed the people that need it these
[1:02:17] things are very very important and they
[1:02:19] they go
[1:02:21] unseen but vitally vitally important as
[1:02:24] I said if you have a pastor who takes
[1:02:27] too much on himself it does it results
[1:02:30] in a congregation that doesn't have a
[1:02:32] close enough walk with the Lord all of
[1:02:34] us are in this
[1:02:36] together remember the church is not a
[1:02:38] building where you gather on Sunday the
[1:02:40] church is a group of individ individual
[1:02:42] people excuse me who have dedicated
[1:02:45] their entire lives from the moment they
[1:02:49] wake up in the morning to the moment
[1:02:50] they fall asleep at night to serving God
[1:02:54] by making making disciples of the Lord
[1:02:56] Jesus don't think that church is Sunday
[1:02:59] morning Sunday morning is just a nice
[1:03:02] time that we can come together and
[1:03:04] fellowship together sing and praise the
[1:03:07] Lord together and hear a sermon but
[1:03:09] church is all the time every day this
[1:03:13] building right here is not the
[1:03:16] church this building should just help
[1:03:19] build a
[1:03:20] road for the for the believer to get to
[1:03:23] Christ but it's not this is not the
[1:03:25] church we the individuals of the
[1:03:30] church so we went over the
[1:03:34] qualifications on
[1:03:36] Wednesday of pastors and deacons and
[1:03:39] trustees and that and one thing that
[1:03:41] really struck me and it was a
[1:03:42] qualification in the pastor and I think
[1:03:44] it's something that all of us should
[1:03:47] have and in 1 Timothy it says that a
[1:03:51] pastor should have a good reputation
[1:03:56] with those that are outside the church I
[1:04:00] think how important is
[1:04:02] that that person that is in the church
[1:04:05] now is the same person that goes to work
[1:04:07] every day it's the same person that's
[1:04:10] driving on the highway it's the same
[1:04:12] person
[1:04:13] that comes home at night and makes makes
[1:04:16] dinner and all of this everything about
[1:04:21] being a Christian should be taken
[1:04:25] seriously to our lives and not not just
[1:04:30] while we're here I want to say I just
[1:04:33] noticed Sister Sarah God bless you it's
[1:04:35] good to have you back I'm glad that the
[1:04:37] Lord took care of you go God bless you
[1:04:40] and welcome back home sister Sarah's
[1:04:43] gone through some sicknesses it's um
[1:04:45] it's good to see you and continue to
[1:04:46] pray for your family your
[1:04:48] [Applause]
[1:04:53] sister how
[1:04:55] important is this
[1:04:59] word that we live it every day Isaiah
[1:05:02] 66 verse one it says this thus sayeth
[1:05:06] the
[1:05:07] Lord the heaven is my throne and the

[1:06:14] lives and into our hearts saying Lord am
[1:06:15] I living up to that these Stakes are
[1:06:18] very very
[1:06:21] high we don't
[1:06:23] take we should take
[1:06:26] communion we should take these Church
[1:06:28] elections we should take coming every
[1:06:31] day into the service of the lord we
[1:06:34] should take everything more seriously I
[1:06:37] don't want to do anything
[1:06:39] halfway if the word teaches us to take
[1:06:42] the bread and the wine worthily then I
[1:06:44] want to be on my knees praying and
[1:06:46] repenting for my
[1:06:48] sins if I'm going to be a member of this
[1:06:51] church I am going to be as important to
[1:06:54] this church as the pastor is don't do
[1:06:57] anything halfway do it the whole way if
[1:07:00] I have a gift of Music in my
[1:07:03] life I am going to take that gift and I
[1:07:06] am going to make disciples with that
[1:07:09] gift I am going to Worship the Lord like
[1:07:12] that story that I told about Jehoshaphat
[1:07:14] sending his worshippers out before how
[1:07:17] important you may not think a piano
[1:07:20] player is important until she's not
[1:07:23] there
[1:07:26] yeah give the our piano our musicians a
[1:07:29] [Applause]
[1:07:33] hand we got two of them right here these
[1:07:36] young ladies and then another sister Ho
[1:07:38] back there sister Martha's not here and
[1:07:40] brother Aaron and and and all of them
[1:07:42] that that contribut so much it's a
[1:07:45] Ministry and it brought down an entire
[1:07:49] Army how important is
[1:07:52] worship every Single part of what we do
[1:07:55] is vitally important you may not think
[1:07:59] it but God will use
[1:08:03] it Isaiah chapter 8 says this verse
[1:08:07] 13 it says sanctify the Lord of hosts
[1:08:11] himself and let him be your fear and let
[1:08:14] him be your
[1:08:17] dread so often we fear about what people
[1:08:20] are going to say we fear about what
[1:08:24] they're going to think in coming to an
[1:08:28] election or making a Church decision We
[1:08:30] Fear maybe what the church is going to
[1:08:32] going to say or the directions or how
[1:08:34] they're going to complain or how they're
[1:08:36] going to worry we should never fear
[1:08:38] about anything if there's honesty in our
[1:08:40] heart and we're doing everything the
[1:08:42] best that we can right there is no fear
[1:08:45] ever in should be anywhere in us there's
[1:08:48] been some reporters going around I don't
[1:08:50] know if you've heard of them they came
[1:08:51] to our church and we recognized them
[1:08:53] they stood up and we clapped for them
[1:08:55] they've been going to different message
[1:08:57] churches and I'll tell you what you got
[1:09:00] these these pastors are scared to death
[1:09:03] right now I've had the brothers calling
[1:09:06] me saying oh well they showed up at this
[1:09:08] place and and they showed up at my
[1:09:09] church and and and they're
[1:09:12] worried Pastor what are you worried
[1:09:16] about if you're being
[1:09:19] honest and your life is lining
[1:09:22] up what are you worried about that
[1:09:25] somebody's going to dig into your life
[1:09:27] and find something it shouldn't be there
[1:09:28] in the first
[1:09:30] place and are you going to worry about
[1:09:33] they're GNA they're going to hear
[1:09:34] something brother brandom
[1:09:36] said and they're gonna they're going to
[1:09:38] attack us for it I'm proud of what he
[1:09:40] said I'm proud of all that he said for
[1:09:43] heaven's sakes I mean don't worry there
[1:09:47] should never be any fear in us if we are
[1:09:50] being
[1:09:52] honest no fear brother Lyall
[1:09:56] none I was but if we're doing things
[1:10:01] wrong then that fear will be present I
[1:10:04] was we had um we had a Christmas party
[1:10:07] it seems like a couple years ago it was
[1:10:08] probably 10 12 years ago in
[1:10:11] Jeffersonville and uh really nice party
[1:10:15] and and um the
[1:10:18] uh we all got
[1:10:20] gifts um and it was like a it wasn't
[1:10:23] like a gift exchange but it wasn't a
[1:10:24] personal gift but it was they were nice
[1:10:26] gifts and we all ended up with a gift
[1:10:28] when we left we played like a game that
[1:10:30] you play at Christmas time and the gift
[1:10:33] that I got it was from Dick Sporting
[1:10:37] Goods and I already had one I forgot
[1:10:40] what it was but I already had it so I
[1:10:44] felt like well I'll just take it back
[1:10:47] and I'll get a store credit and I need a
[1:10:49] new stationary bike I'll get I'll get
[1:10:52] that instead so I go there and I was
[1:10:55] kind of worried that somebody was going
[1:10:56] to see me taking my gift
[1:11:00] back so we get
[1:11:03] there I I'm sure it was was probably
[1:11:05] with Stephanie so we get there and I I I
[1:11:10] exchange the thing and they give me the
[1:11:12] little store credit and I'm looking
[1:11:16] around for something to replace my gift
[1:11:20] with something that I
[1:11:21] want and I get a phone
[1:11:26] call and it's the pastor's
[1:11:29] son one that gave me the
[1:11:32] gift and I was like oh so I answer the
[1:11:39] phone and he says hey Z bro he says uh
[1:11:44] he said where are you right
[1:11:47] now and you know what I said Bass Pro
[1:11:52] Shops
[1:11:54] which is right next to dicks I
[1:11:57] lied and I thought as right as I said
[1:12:01] that something said you did
[1:12:04] wrong like and you know how your brain
[1:12:07] can work really fast in a short amount
[1:12:10] of time I mean it was going and going
[1:12:12] and going and going and it was probably
[1:12:14] it seemed like like a minute but it was
[1:12:17] probably a fraction of a second and I
[1:12:20] was thinking oh you know going to know
[1:12:23] that I'm exchanging my gift and I just
[1:12:25] lied and I said I said
[1:12:28] actually I said I'm in Dick's Sporting
[1:12:32] Goods and he said I
[1:12:36] know he says I'm looking at you right
[1:12:41] [Applause]
[1:12:46] now I
[1:12:51] li and it was right it was right there
[1:12:55] and and it's it's so easy just to say
[1:12:57] something's wrong but that would have
[1:12:58] been a mark on
[1:13:01] me that would have been something to be
[1:13:03] ashamed of and I was ashamed of it that
[1:13:06] it came out of my mouth but thankfully I
[1:13:09] fessed up before I act I mean I was
[1:13:12] caught but I fessed up before um you
[1:13:19] know there's a king we all know there's
[1:13:23] I mention Jehoshaphat at the beginning
[1:13:26] there was another king about
[1:13:27] jehoshaphat's time was King Ahab Ahab
[1:13:30] was the king of the 10 tribes of Israel
[1:13:34] Jehoshaphat was the king of Judah and
[1:13:38] Benjamin so Israel was
[1:13:41] split into two basically two different
[1:13:45] uh countries for lack of a better word
[1:13:49] Jehoshaphat um was a good righteous man
[1:13:51] Ahab wasn't so much but Ahab was a man
[1:13:54] that was familiar with war and it got
[1:13:59] towards he was prophesied that a that he
[1:14:01] was going to die in battle yet he didn't
[1:14:05] believe what the prophet said and he
[1:14:07] went ahead and he went into
[1:14:10] battle to go against this enemy
[1:14:14] Army and josphat I mean and Ahab put on
[1:14:18] his
[1:14:20] armor and as he was out in his
[1:14:23] Chariot
[1:14:26] fighting an enemy Archer pulled back his
[1:14:31] bow now Ahab wasn't in his King garments
[1:14:34] he was disguised as somebody else the
[1:14:37] Archer pulled back his bow and
[1:14:40] shoots and
[1:14:42] randomly this Arrow comes down and
[1:14:46] ahab's in the back of his Chariot and
[1:14:48] he's going this Arrow comes down and
[1:14:51] there was a small
[1:14:54] Gap in ahab's armor and the arrow went
[1:14:58] right into that
[1:15:01] Gap and buried itself into
[1:15:05] Ahab Ahab tells the driver of his
[1:15:07] Chariot he says pull me from the battle
[1:15:10] he says I'm wounded so they go out and
[1:15:14] Ahab leans up against his Chariot and
[1:15:17] he's bleeding out and he's watching the
[1:15:20] battle and Ahab dies
[1:15:24] and as that as I was reading that I was
[1:15:28] thinking why was there a Gap in ahab's
[1:15:33] armor Ahab of course he was a man of war
[1:15:37] but he probably wasn't used to cinching
[1:15:39] up the armor of an inry entry um
[1:15:43] infantry
[1:15:44] man so he goes out and he must have not
[1:15:48] put it on correctly and it left a gap in
[1:15:52] there
[1:15:54] as I said he was a man familiar with
[1:15:57] war but that Gap caused him to lose his
[1:16:01] life and I think as as all of us as we
[1:16:03] are cinching up our armor is there
[1:16:06] something in our life that we leave
[1:16:10] unhinged and then that is the place
[1:16:13] where the enemy can come in right there
[1:16:16] as he did with
[1:16:18] Ahab I was speaking of
[1:16:20] Ahab um Donald Trump
[1:16:23] is a un I'm just
[1:16:30] kidding I hope he I don't
[1:16:34] care I I hope the country prospers
[1:16:37] that's that's what I hope but have you
[1:16:39] seen Donald Trump is on trial right now
[1:16:42] he's on trial you know what he's on
[1:16:44] trial for he's on trial because he he
[1:16:48] inflated his net worth on a loan
[1:16:52] application
[1:16:53] that was a in his
[1:16:56] armor so now as the enemy is coming
[1:17:00] against him to get him out of this
[1:17:03] election and destroy this man who they
[1:17:08] hate he did something wrong earlier and
[1:17:12] it left a gap as Ahab left a gap in his
[1:17:16] armor and it has allowed the enemy to
[1:17:19] come
[1:17:21] in and hit it
[1:17:24] him and hurt him and the way that it's
[1:17:28] going right now who knows what's going
[1:17:30] to happen he'll probably be he'll
[1:17:33] probably be on the ballot but how much
[1:17:37] do these people hate Donald Trump and
[1:17:39] let me tell you the enemy hates you far
[1:17:43] worse than anybody hates Donald Trump he
[1:17:48] wants us and he is going to study you
[1:17:51] he's going to watch you and and he's
[1:17:53] going to see where has this person left
[1:17:56] something undone you think it's just
[1:17:58] church you think it's just coming in
[1:18:00] here but there are things in our lives
[1:18:03] like me and Dick Sporting Goods where I
[1:18:05] just told this real simple little lie
[1:18:07] and it could open up a gap in our armor
[1:18:10] and cause us to be
[1:18:13] destroyed thinking of these these
[1:18:15] reporters coming in P Pastor
[1:18:18] people you better have a good
[1:18:21] life you better be honest you better be
[1:18:25] preaching things that are right because
[1:18:27] if you're not it opens up a gap in that
[1:18:30] armor and it will take us down remember
[1:18:34] Ain he goes in and and he and Joshua
[1:18:37] forbids them to take anything no one saw
[1:18:40] what aen was doing achen goes in he
[1:18:43] takes a wedge of gold and he takes a
[1:18:44] garment sneaks it doesn't hurt anybody
[1:18:48] nobody knows takes it and hides it and
[1:18:51] it causes men to to die in battle and
[1:18:54] then to lose the
[1:18:56] battle because of that one thing inside
[1:18:59] the
[1:19:00] congregation that no one knew oh my when
[1:19:04] they were asking about achen they're
[1:19:05] like who's this guy they said well he's
[1:19:08] from his dad is this his Grandpa's this
[1:19:10] he's from this tribe but it caused the
[1:19:13] whole congregation to
[1:19:15] suffer because of one little in
[1:19:17] the armor one little
[1:19:20] sin how many of us
[1:19:23] have those sins in our lives so we need
[1:19:26] to cinch up that armor for battle if
[1:19:29] you're going to
[1:19:31] school study like a Christian would
[1:19:34] study it's not just you think everything
[1:19:37] is
[1:19:38] spiritual don't just think it's when you
[1:19:40] come to church everything in our lives
[1:19:43] has to do with
[1:19:44] God if you're working on the
[1:19:46] construction site be a be the best
[1:19:50] employee like a Christian would if
[1:19:53] you're in church prepare before you get
[1:19:56] here be ready for God to do something if
[1:19:59] you're driving drive like a
[1:20:03] Christian somebody's watching you if
[1:20:05] you're walking walk like a Christian if
[1:20:07] you're talking talk like a Christian act
[1:20:09] like a Christian in every way and you
[1:20:12] say well he just won't speak to
[1:20:16] me if you're seeking the Holy Spirit are
[1:20:20] you
[1:20:20] praying don't just talk about it oh
[1:20:24] brother Daniel I'd really just pray for
[1:20:26] me that the Lord will give me the Holy
[1:20:27] Spirit are you praying are you
[1:20:30] fasting are you doing everything you can
[1:20:32] to hear God's
[1:20:35] voice we've talked about a Revival do
[1:20:37] you want a Revival do you want a Revival
[1:20:40] in this church yes sir are you looking
[1:20:43] at pornography come on are you lying on
[1:20:47] are you a good employee at
[1:20:50] work are you speaking evil against
[1:20:53] someone else even if it's true and you
[1:20:56] want a Revival wow those things need to
[1:20:59] be set
[1:21:01] aside also are we putting God in a box
[1:21:06] and telling them that telling him that a
[1:21:08] Revival needs to be people crying at the
[1:21:10] altar and the Lord and and falling down
[1:21:13] and speaking in tongues and and even
[1:21:15] then it has to be under this
[1:21:17] roof don't put God in a box sir I
[1:21:21] believe that we will have that but don't
[1:21:22] put put him in a box he could have a
[1:21:24] Revival anywhere he wants like when
[1:21:26] josaphat sent out the worshippers there
[1:21:28] are these great warriors and how many
[1:21:30] people have they killed and they're
[1:21:32] ready for battle it's like
[1:21:34] them these little skinny guys these
[1:21:40] girls and the Army was
[1:21:44] destroyed wherever you are whatever we
[1:21:48] are
[1:21:49] doing be there be there 100 100% if
[1:21:54] you're at work if you're studying for
[1:21:57] school if you're talking to somebody at
[1:22:00] the grocery store whatever you are doing
[1:22:04] be the best that you can
[1:22:06] be how many times have I heard people
[1:22:09] saying well I got to lose some
[1:22:13] weight stop eating so
[1:22:18] much well I'll do the keto diet I'll do
[1:22:21] the grapefruit diet I'll do whatever
[1:22:23] those don't none of them work you know
[1:22:25] that right they don't
[1:22:26] work God made a law he made a
[1:22:30] rule that if you take in more calories
[1:22:35] than you burn it will be stored as
[1:22:38] fat that's God's rule wow there's no way
[1:22:42] out of it and it's the same with
[1:22:44] everything in life if you study more in
[1:22:47] school you are going to be more
[1:22:50] successful I've always considered
[1:22:55] my biggest regret in
[1:22:58] life is that I didn't work hard
[1:23:01] enough I've always been someone that
[1:23:03] that was respected at work as a hard
[1:23:05] worker one that would stay longer one
[1:23:07] that would accomplish more and it was
[1:23:09] because of a work ethic that I had but I
[1:23:11] looked back on my life and I thought
[1:23:12] Lord think I I could have done so much
[1:23:16] more if I would have studied harder in
[1:23:18] school I would have been more
[1:23:21] successful if I would have worked harder
[1:23:23] spent more hours at work I would have
[1:23:26] have moved up faster if I would have
[1:23:28] studied more in my life I'd be a better
[1:23:31] Minister now
[1:23:34] maybe Daniel my son for years and years
[1:23:39] he would wake up with me at 4:30 in the
[1:23:42] morning 4:15 in the
[1:23:44] morning and I get up I'd study this
[1:23:49] blessed
[1:23:51] word buddy how much do you appreciate
[1:23:54] those times that we had together every
[1:23:58] day waking up for at least an hour and a
[1:24:02] half
[1:24:04] studying reading listening taking notes
[1:24:09] and trying to understand but even at
[1:24:12] that I wish I would have done
[1:24:15] more I'd be a better person today if I
[1:24:18] would have and all of us and I don't
[1:24:21] care now I'm 52 years
[1:24:24] old I want to start now in the things
[1:24:27] that I've I've left undone I want to
[1:24:30] work harder and I want to I want to be
[1:24:32] more successful I want to serve this
[1:24:35] church I want I want to see everyone
[1:24:37] here full of the Holy Spirit out
[1:24:40] preaching the gospel in some way yes
[1:24:43] whether it be praying for the sick or
[1:24:45] whether it be preaching in a park or
[1:24:47] whether it be singing and worshiping
[1:24:49] whatever it is I want to see everyone
[1:24:51] here ser serving God and winning souls

[1:25:35] that buddy if you study and you you work
[1:25:40] hard and you say I want to be Daniel has
[1:25:42] had it on his life his hard to be a

[1:26:00] effort I was talking with brother Kim
[1:26:02] dingwall out outside on Wednesday night
[1:26:05] we were talking about this
[1:26:07] generation and I was I was talking about
[1:26:09] Daniel and how Daniel he cares for um
[1:26:12] he's got a a part-time job where he
[1:26:14] cares for elderly and people that can't
[1:26:18] care for themselves that are in in in
[1:26:21] tough health health situ situations and
[1:26:23] Daniel's told me many times he's like
[1:26:25] Dad they don't have anybody that comes
[1:26:26] to see them they don't have a
[1:26:30] family their children don't
[1:26:33] care my first thought is what kind of a
[1:26:35] bad generation is
[1:26:37] this but then he talking to brother Kim
[1:26:40] out there he's like well maybe it's not
[1:26:42] that
[1:26:43] way he says he says that this is a
[1:26:46] generational problem and what was wrong
[1:26:49] was the parents didn't spend enough time
[1:26:51] with their
[1:26:53] children so now their kids and their
[1:26:56] grandkids don't want to spend time with
[1:26:58] them and they leave them alone so whose
[1:27:01] fault is it is it the kids or is it the
[1:27:08] parents I spent time with
[1:27:12] [Laughter]
[1:27:17] you as you can tell I'm I'm proud of my
[1:27:20] family we all have we all have problems
[1:27:23] I love my my son's my he's my best
[1:27:26] friend Galatians chapter 6 says this
[1:27:29] verse 7 says be not deceived God is Not
[1:27:33] mocked for whatsoever a man Seth that
[1:27:37] shall he also
[1:27:38] reap for he that sth to his flesh shall
[1:27:43] of the flesh reap corruption but he that
[1:27:46] Seth to the spirit shall of the spirit
[1:27:49] reap life Everlasting all of of that
[1:27:52] time that you put in all of those seeds
[1:27:55] that you're planting in your study and
[1:27:57] your prayer you are going to reap from
[1:27:59] those seeds they're going to grow and
[1:28:02] let us not be weary in well-doing for in
[1:28:05] due season we shall reap if we faint
[1:28:09] not as we therefore as we have therefore
[1:28:13] opportunity let us do good unto all men
[1:28:16] especially unto them that are of the
[1:28:18] household of
[1:28:19] faith if you
[1:28:22] put the time into your job you are going
[1:28:26] to reap the benefits later on if you put
[1:28:30] the time as I said into school you are
[1:28:33] going to reap those benefits later on if
[1:28:35] you put the time into prayer you will
[1:28:39] reap those benefits later on I just
[1:28:42] preached the the message on Zachariah
[1:28:45] the father of John the Baptist and how
[1:28:47] he spent time the Bible says the angel
[1:28:50] came to him and said Zachariah God has
[1:28:52] heard your prayer that was a prayer it
[1:28:54] had to be from a long long time ago he
[1:28:57] was old and couldn't have
[1:28:59] children he wasn't praying then for a
[1:29:02] son or if the angel would have came to
[1:29:04] him he would have been like praise the
[1:29:05] Lord thank you it must have been years
[1:29:08] or decades earlier that he prayed that
[1:29:12] he reaped what Zachariah sold and God
[1:29:16] gave him the best
[1:29:20] son the son
[1:29:22] introduced Jesus Christ to the
[1:29:26] world as Jesus said a man's never been
[1:29:29] born of a woman greater than
[1:29:31] him he reaped what he sowed and that's
[1:29:35] for us make sure that that armor is
[1:29:38] tightened down because we'll reap for
[1:29:42] every lie that we say we will reap for
[1:29:47] every time we lie on a application for
[1:29:52] credit as Donald Trump
[1:29:54] did we are going to reap for every
[1:29:58] moment that we've spent studying our
[1:30:01] Bibles we are going to reap for every
[1:30:04] time that we came to church we are going
[1:30:08] to reap for every moment of prayer that
[1:30:11] we've had it says right here that let us
[1:30:15] not be weary and well-doing for a due
[1:30:17] season we shall reap if we faint not
[1:30:19] continue on keep trying keep keep
[1:30:22] trying don't faint don't get discouraged
[1:30:26] keep
[1:30:30] going one of those weaknesses in the
[1:30:34] armor may be that we're not willing to
[1:30:39] give I think it's very very common today
[1:30:42] it's it's common all around us give to
[1:30:44] your family give to your co-workers give
[1:30:47] to your church be willing to serve
[1:30:52] Ephesians chapter 6 a famous scripture
[1:30:56] but I want to read it in a way that you
[1:30:58] may not have seen it from a perspective
[1:31:00] that that you may not have seen and
[1:31:01] we'll close with this Ephesians chapter
[1:31:05] 6 vers1 it says this it says children
[1:31:07] obey your parents in the Lord for this
[1:31:08] is
[1:31:09] right honor thy father and thy mother
[1:31:12] which is the first commandment with
[1:31:13] promise that it may be well with thee
[1:31:16] and that thou mayest live long on the
[1:31:18] earth he's starting with things that are
[1:31:20] small here
[1:31:23] like me lying and Dix Sporting
[1:31:26] Goods don't do those things is what
[1:31:29] Paul's saying cinch up that armor and
[1:31:33] you fathers provoke not your children to
[1:31:35] wrath but bring them up in the nurture
[1:31:39] and admonition of the Lord he's talking
[1:31:42] about the family and the little things
[1:31:44] in life how we should raise our children
[1:31:46] nurture them and love them and teach
[1:31:49] them about the Lord later we'll reap
[1:31:51] what we
[1:31:53] so servants be obedient to them that are
[1:31:56] your Masters according to the flesh with
[1:31:59] fear and trembling and singleness of
[1:32:01] your heart as unto Christ that word
[1:32:04] servant is probably when it was written
[1:32:06] was probably a slave but today treat
[1:32:09] your boss well treat your supervisor
[1:32:12] well respect them that have rule over
[1:32:14] you whether it's here at
[1:32:18] work or here at church with a pure heart
[1:32:22] seek to please them as you would want to
[1:32:25] please Christ let me tell you if you do
[1:32:27] that you'll also be very successful in
[1:32:29] business you'll be successful in your
[1:32:32] job not with eye Service as men Pleasers
[1:32:36] but as the Servants of Christ doing the
[1:32:38] will of God from the heart be sincere
[1:32:41] with your
[1:32:43] servitude don't just work when someone's
[1:32:45] watching and slack when they're not
[1:32:48] watching don't just serve somebody so
[1:32:51] you you'll get kudos from the church wow
[1:32:55] do it and don't let anybody know about
[1:32:58] it serve each other you don't have to
[1:33:03] get a thanks if you get a thanks then
[1:33:05] you have your reward but do it in
[1:33:08] private and let God take care of it I
[1:33:11] promise you God will give you a better
[1:33:13] reward than anyone from this Pulpit
[1:33:15] would give
[1:33:17] you with Good Will doing Service as to
[1:33:21] the Lord and not to men so we serve with
[1:33:24] all of our heart as you would serve the
[1:33:26] Lord Jesus Jesus is not here he's here
[1:33:30] in spirit and his PE and in his people
[1:33:33] and we serve each other as we would
[1:33:35] serve
[1:33:41] Christ
[1:33:42] knowing that whatsoever good thing any
[1:33:46] man doeth the same shall he receive of
[1:33:48] the Lord whether he be Bond or free you
[1:33:51] reap what you sow and ye Masters do the
[1:33:55] same things unto them forbearing
[1:33:57] threatening knowing that your master
[1:34:00] also is in heaven neither is there
[1:34:02] respect with persons for him if you're
[1:34:04] the boss be good to those people that
[1:34:06] are working for you treat them with
[1:34:10] respect don't use harsh words because
[1:34:14] you don't want Christ to use harsh words
[1:34:17] with you and you don't want your boss to
[1:34:19] use harsh words with you so you as you
[1:34:22] would want somebody to do to you
[1:34:24] remember that no no matter how important
[1:34:27] you think you are or how important of a
[1:34:30] position you have God has no partiality
[1:34:33] no matter what position you hold in
[1:34:35] Earth that includes the pastor of a
[1:34:37] church and includes the president of the
[1:34:39] United States you are no more important
[1:34:43] than anyone else that is in the
[1:34:45] church and God will not hear someone's
[1:34:48] prayers over someone else just because
[1:34:52] that person thinks he's
[1:34:56] important and by doing these
[1:35:00] things what are we ultimately
[1:35:04] accomplishing Paul's not talking about
[1:35:06] murder here these are little things he's
[1:35:10] not talking about
[1:35:11] adultery he's not talking about lying
[1:35:15] and all this and and and all this
[1:35:17] cheating and all this immorality he's
[1:35:19] talking about the little things that are
[1:35:21] in our lives every day so what is he
[1:35:23] trying to
[1:35:25] say remember Ahab in his
[1:35:28] armor it wasn't cinched up all the way
[1:35:32] there was a hole
[1:35:33] there finally my brethren be strong in
[1:35:36] the Lord and in the power of His might
[1:35:39] put on the whole armor of God that you
[1:35:41] may be able to stand against the Ws of
[1:35:43] the devil for we wrestle not against
[1:35:45] flesh and blood but against
[1:35:47] principalities against Powers against
[1:35:49] rulers of Darkness of this world against
[1:35:51] spiritual wickedness in high places
[1:35:53] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[1:35:55] of God that you may able to with be may

[1:36:26] when you're spending time learning the
[1:36:27] word you're buckling up that helmet

[1:36:33] football he uh big lineman he um his
[1:36:37] helmet on and his chin strap was
[1:36:40] loose and you know they they're always
[1:36:42] banging on each other on the line and he

[1:36:48] chin strap was loose it wasn't buckled
[1:36:50] up tight his helmet came down and hit
[1:36:52] him on the bridge of the nose right here
[1:36:55] and cut it open broke his nose he looked

[1:37:07] lives whatever it

[1:37:49] perseverance and supp applications for
[1:37:52] all the
[1:37:54] saints so Tucson
[1:37:58] Tabernacle been talking about weakness
[1:38:00] in our
[1:38:02] armor and some of that weakness may be
[1:38:04] that we're not willing to give enough
[1:38:07] enough of our time enough of our prayers
[1:38:10] whatever we have to give we should give
[1:38:15] more the
[1:38:16] men that I've
[1:38:19] nominated for these positions
[1:38:22] they may not be the best
[1:38:25] qualified they may not be the most
[1:38:29] capable but they have shown that they
[1:38:31] are willing to give and they they're
[1:38:33] willing to try I really
[1:38:36] appreciated brother Aaron I think the
[1:38:38] Lord blessed blessed
[1:38:40] your sacrifice this morning in learning
[1:38:43] that song Psalms 34 brother Aaron was so
[1:38:47] nervous about about singing that and it
[1:38:50] just he number one he knows that I love
[1:38:53] it and Matthew mcfaden he used to
[1:38:57] singing and and Matthew had a had a
[1:38:59] certain type of a voice and he was young
[1:39:01] and and brother Aaron saw that it
[1:39:04] blessed the people so he he wanted to
[1:39:06] try and learn it and he did and it
[1:39:10] blessed us
[1:39:12] all and these brothers that I have
[1:39:15] nominated they have shown that they are
[1:39:19] willing to do their best they're willing
[1:39:22] to follow leadership both from me and
[1:39:26] from the holy spirit in their
[1:39:28] lives and as a church I don't want to do
[1:39:32] anything
[1:39:33] halfway I am not I'll tell you this I am
[1:39:39] not
[1:39:40] satisfied with this building I'm not
[1:39:43] satisfied with all of your walks with
[1:39:46] the Lord and I am not satisfied with my
[1:39:48] walk with the
[1:39:49] Lord there is so so much more to do we
[1:39:52] have got so much more we are on this
[1:39:55] Earth for just a short amount of time
[1:40:00] and I feel like now I'm 52 it's like
[1:40:02] Lord I'm I'm on the the last half
[1:40:05] here more than that there's so much to
[1:40:10] do Lord give me more time give me more
[1:40:13] life give me give me more strength to do
[1:40:16] it for when we're
[1:40:19] finished it's over there's no more
[1:40:22] serving God there's no more winning
[1:40:26] Souls there's just we'll go to our
[1:40:30] reward and we'll be in the presence of
[1:40:33] God and and with and with his Saints and
[1:40:37] and we'll have made it but I want to be
[1:40:39] able to look back and say that I was
[1:40:42] able to pull some of these out of the
[1:40:45] fire every one of us should have that
[1:40:47] same desire I don't care if you're a kid
[1:40:50] I don't care if you're 90 years
[1:40:53] old if you have breath in your lungs you
[1:40:56] should be trying to make a disciple to
[1:40:59] Jesus Christ not necessarily bring them
[1:41:01] to just this church but get them a
[1:41:03] relationship with God that is why we are
[1:41:06] here on Earth don't neglect that never
[1:41:10] be satisfied with your church never be
[1:41:13] satisfied with the minister and
[1:41:15] especially never be satisfied with
[1:41:18] yourself because there's more to do
[1:41:22] always be striving and pushing and
[1:41:24] working to get more of Jesus Christ
[1:41:27] musicians if you
[1:41:30] come I read this quote on Wednesday
[1:41:33] brother
[1:41:35] um Ed if you could pass out the ballots
[1:41:42] please I read this quote on
[1:41:45] Wednesday it meant meant something to me
[1:41:51] all the word means means something to me
[1:41:53] but this one especially touched my heart
[1:41:56] it says here and it touched my
[1:41:59] heart because my
[1:42:03] ancestors gave a
[1:42:06] lot to come to meetings like
[1:42:11] this just my the people that went before
[1:42:14] me that I'm I am benefiting today from
[1:42:17] what they've done as most of you are
[1:42:19] also
[1:42:22] says
[1:42:23] this and I have some real Royal friends
[1:42:27] there that are very fine
[1:42:30] people and so they're very loyal to go
[1:42:33] to church no matter how cold it is
[1:42:36] they'll wrap up in a blanket and sit on
[1:42:39] a bob sled and drive the horse for 30
[1:42:41] miles to get to go to church those times
[1:42:45] are in the past they might come back but
[1:42:48] look at what our ancestors have done
[1:42:50] [Music]
[1:42:52] they'll walk through the snow drifts and
[1:42:54] everything else young and
[1:42:56] old they'll all group
[1:42:59] together and one family gets the other
[1:43:02] and they'll start walking and they go
[1:43:05] it's the sacrifice that they make is
[1:43:08] what causes them to get so much out of
[1:43:11] service when there's no
[1:43:14] sacrifice there's not very much to the
[1:43:18] service you have to really get down down
[1:43:21] and do something that hurts real bad
[1:43:24] have to lay aside some things and stop
[1:43:26] the work or do this or that to get to go
[1:43:31] to church and show God that you love him
[1:43:35] and you make a sacrifice to go it's then
[1:43:38] when you get something out of
[1:43:40] it
[1:43:42] amen that's something that all of us can
[1:43:45] learn from we should all put more effort
[1:43:48] into everything that we do is especially
[1:43:51] serving the lord in fact everything that
[1:43:53] we do should be serving the lord whether
[1:43:56] it's going to
[1:43:57] work whether it's helping somebody on
[1:44:00] the street doing a service to
[1:44:03] anyone always serve
[1:44:09] [Music]

[1:45:16] [Music]
[1:45:19] o'
[1:45:23] what we'll do right now is once you have
[1:45:26] voted and the brothers have picked up
[1:45:30] the ballots I've asked brother Dan
[1:45:34] Roberts and brother Ron
[1:45:39] glidewell brother Ron where are you
[1:45:42] there you are brother Ron glidewell to
[1:45:44] be
[1:45:45] witnesses as we count the
[1:45:47] votes so the three of us will go back
[1:45:50] here in the office we'll count the votes
[1:45:52] and we'll come out with the results acts
[1:45:56] 6 verse
[1:45:59] 1 says this and in those days when the
[1:46:03] number of the disciples was multiplied
[1:46:06] wouldn't you love to see those days sir
[1:46:08] more and more and more and in those days
[1:46:11] when the number of the disciples was
[1:46:12] multiplied there arose a murmuring of
[1:46:15] the grecians against the Hebrews because
[1:46:17] their widows were neglected in the daily
[1:46:19] ministration
[1:46:21] then the 12 called the multitude of the
[1:46:24] disciples unto them and said it is
[1:46:27] not reason that we should leave the word
[1:46:30] of God and serve
[1:46:32] tables wherefore Brethren look out ye
[1:46:36] among you seven of them of seven men of
[1:46:39] honest report full of Holy Ghost and
[1:46:41] wisdom who we may appoint over this
[1:46:46] business but we will give ourselves
[1:46:48] continually to prayer and to the
[1:46:50] Ministry of the word and the saying
[1:46:52] pleased the whole multitude and they
[1:46:54] chose Steven A Man full of faith and of
[1:46:57] the Holy Ghost and Phillip and procus
[1:46:59] and
[1:47:00] niker and
[1:47:02] teemon and parmenas and Nicholas a prite
[1:47:06] of Antioch whom they set before the
[1:47:08] apostles and when they had prayed they
[1:47:11] laid their hands on
[1:47:13] them so brothers and sisters I present
[1:47:16] this vote to

[2:12:14] brother Aaron if you could come stand
[2:12:16] down here brother Jordan is not with as
[2:12:18] we all know because he's up helping his
[2:12:21] family and if our new officials in the
[2:12:24] church could stand down
[2:12:32] here let me read one more
[2:12:35] time Acts chapter
[2:12:39] 6 says this this is the ordination of
[2:12:43] deacons it says wherefore Brethren look
[2:12:46] ye out among you seven men of honest
[2:12:49] report full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom
[2:12:52] whom we may appoint over this business
[2:12:54] but we will give ourselves continually
[2:12:56] to prayer and to the ministry of the
[2:12:59] word and the saying pleased the whole
[2:13:01] multitude and they chose
[2:13:05] Stephen right there is our vote and they
[2:13:09] chose Stephen I'm going to assume that
[2:13:12] that's a
[2:13:13] congregation may have been the disciples
[2:13:16] but I'm going to assume that that's the
[2:13:17] congregation
[2:13:19] and they chose Steven A Man full of
[2:13:21] faith and of the Holy Ghost and Phillip
[2:13:24] and procus and naner and Tean and
[2:13:28] parmenas and Nicholas a proelite of
[2:13:31] Antioch whom they set before the
[2:13:33] apostles and when they had laid when
[2:13:36] they had prayed they laid their hands on
[2:13:39] them and the word of God
[2:13:42] increased and the number of the
[2:13:44] disciples multiplied in Jerusalem
[2:13:46] greatly and a great company of priests
[2:13:49] were obedient to the
[2:13:52] faith I claim the same thing for our
[2:13:56] church Brethren if if the elders in the
[2:13:59] church if the brothers would come
[2:14:01] forward please I want the brothers to
[2:14:03] come forward and I want to lay hands on
[2:14:06] these brothers so um Brothers if you
