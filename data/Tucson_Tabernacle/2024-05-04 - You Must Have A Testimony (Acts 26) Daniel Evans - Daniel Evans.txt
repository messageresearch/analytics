brother Ryan's service this morning I didn't know him very well but I felt like the Lord was leading to have him minister to us and wow it as as I said this morning my uh thoughts and ideas were far exceeded as he preached and then three more baptisms it's every Sunday more and more people are coming in and these aren't just kids getting old enough to be baptized these are people giving their hearts to the Lord that have never been in church before and what a blessing that when I was up there this morning oh these these brothers up there seeing the tenderness in these hardened men and and as I was talking with them before baptism saying do you understand what you're doing and just seeing the the lips quiver and the tenderness of that those that those manly men and seeing just the sweetness and The Tender Hearts and how that they wanted to give their hearts to the Lord Jesus and how they did and then making that step in baptism to go up there and before all of these people get baptized never take these things for granted and how often we are seeing these more and more and more people coming in and being baptized never take it for granted and another Soul another two Souls another three Souls like this morning and then it was last week and the week before and over and over more and more never take it for granted friends and it's on this this Sunday night you see that this morning we were full and and now tonight and we're very very few people here but let me tell you these are the pillars in the church that are here tonight the ones holding up the church and making it to where others can coming come in and giving them that right hand of fellowship and treating them with kindness and love and not with a judgmental or a mean spirit treating them with love and compassion and that's why they want to come back they want something that we have and you know what that something is Jesus and the Bible says that God is love Jesus is the very love of God personified feel good tonight I got friends here I haven't seen in a long time sister Marianne claunch God bless your heart it is so I uh sister Marianne we go way way back if I'd had known you were here I'd have had you on this piano singing a song we can still do it [Laughter] Mr Marion God bless you it's good to see how are the Saints in Jeffersonville are they doing everybody's doing good amen me too brother Phillip good friend you know what I love brother Phillip as sister Marianne's son I love seeing friends you know I just do I just love I love it me and brother Phillip what like I won't tell how old you are but it's like 25 years ago we played basketball together and and Philip always had these dirty moves you know and he he used his body in a way that wasn't legal like if there was a referee but there were no referees brother I miss you brother Phillip it's good to see you man I just I love like I said I love seeing friends Brother David sister Sharon God bless you and the family just never friends never take each other for granted the lord gave us he gave us friends he gave us loved ones these are gifts that God's given us as I preached before that when God gives us a gift we can stick our hand up in God's face and say I don't want your gifts we should never do that God gives us loved ones he he gives us Ministry he gives us he gave us a prophet he gives us these these wonderful things and I want all of them I want to just take it in and take it in and take it in because I just love all of God's gifts he's just he is so just so good to us um this Acts chapter 26 we're gonna we're moving our Bible study temporarily to Sunday night tonight to uh to catch up a little bit on the book of Acts and I'll be teaching on Acts 26 tonight but before I do I have this here on my desk brother brother Lyle brought this in what this is I'm not going to pass it around because inevitably it would come back broken um but this is made of alabaster so this is what it looks like and you can see that it's you can scratch it with your fingernail very very soft and this is what I assume brother Lyle what this Mary it was probably her name that she had her oil in this Alabaster Box made here very easy to break but very very like I said I can scratch it with my fingernail very soft and easy easy to make and as a brother said this morning he said it's we need to break it you know that it's what's important is inside and it and it's not the important part isn't the box and we we decorate the box and and make it really nice but the thing of value is inside so brother Lyle thank you thank you for bringing that in it um as I said it's it's uh soft and back then it probably would wouldn't be worth much but the oil inside was worth a whole lot this Acts chapter 25 or Acts chapter 26 let's start brother Jeremy if you could put up Acts 25 23 so we'll go to the previous chapter so we'll know what's going on here and for our visitors we've been going through this book of Acts and we're almost done and we started with Acts chapter 1 and when the Lord Jesus gives his instructions in Acts 22 the day of pen or Acts 2 the day of Pentecost and we have come all the way to this point and brother Lyle Johnson and I have been going back and forth with teaching this Bible study usually on Wednesday nights and it has just been um at least for brother Lyle and me it's been a great blessing and I pray that that blessing has come a little bit from this Pulpit to the others and the understood a little bit more about this Acts so Acts chapter 25 verse 23 it says this and on the morrow now Paul is coming for the fourth trial the Apostle Paul um he's constantly being persecuted by his own people the Jews and he's been brought to trial over and over and over again and I believe this is the fourth time that the Apostle is brought to trial and this time it is before two people those people are Agrippa and Festus and let's get started on that and on tomorrow when agripple was come and Bernice with great pomp and was entered into the place of hearing with the chief captains and principal men of the city at festus's commandment Paul was brought forth now brother Lyle explained in the in the previous Bible study we had he explained who this this Agrippa is and this Agrippa is Herod Agrippa the second now Herod Agrippa has very bad genetics he's um he's the son of Herod Agrippa the first he's the one that had the Apostle James beheaded he's the one that gave the speech and if you remember he gave the speech and everybody's like oh wow he speaks like a God and because he didn't give God credit for that speech he died and the Bible says he was eaten of worms pretty bad death so that's that's Agrippa and his grandpa was this guy Herod Antipas now Herod married his married Antipas married his brother's wife and he was so enamored with his stepdaughter when she danced before him creepy story but he was so enamored with his stepdaughter when she danced in front of him that he said hey I will give you I love your dancing I'll give you anything that you ask for so this young lady his stepdaughter goes to her mother herod's wife who he took from his brother and she hated him she hated this man John the Baptist so much she tells her her daughter go tell Antipas that you want the head of John the Baptist on a platter so then he kills John the Baptist and then that was the the grandpa and then the great grandpa of this this um man that we're talking about now was Herod the Great Herod the Great wasn't so great Herod the Great was the the great builder that built up the temple and built all the buildings and everything in Jerusalem but he's also the one that killed all the babies when the wise men came and said that this Prophecy of the Messiah was going to be fulfilled and he got afraid and he killed all all the babies so that's who is is coming here before the Apostle Paul and he came he comes with this this lady this woman named Bernice um Bernice wasn't such a great person either that was his sister she has basically the same genetics as her brother and um their relationship between Bernice and uh this Herod it wasn't like a brother and sister it wasn't platonic so it was it was just everything was all messed up in this whole thing and this Bernice in in uh josephus's writings which brother Lyle and I have quoted quite a few times this this Bernice is she ends up um she's married a couple times and I think her husband's died or are they divorced and then she ends up dating this guy named Titus this guy named Titus comes to help his um his dad who is a general and I think the dad's name was Vespasian I could be wrong about that but I think the general this Roman general this this Roman's name was Titus this man Titus is that this Bernice is dating is actually the Titus that fulfilled the prophecy that the Lord Jesus gave when he said about Jerusalem not one stone will be left on another this man Titus was the one that destroyed Jerusalem so it's all bad everything's bad in the history everything's bad these people coming before Paul here to judge him it's it's just not such a great group of people that are going to be sitting in the sun the Judgment seat for the Apostle Paul as he comes to trial verse number 24. and Festus said King Agrippa that's Herod Agrippa the second king Agrippa and all men which are here present with us ye see this man about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me both at Jerusalem and also here crying that he ought not to live any longer but when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death and that he himself had appeared and appealed to Augustus that Caesar I have determined to send him of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my Lord whereof I have brought him forth before you and especially before thee O King Agrippa that after examination had I might have somewhat to write for it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not with all to signify the cries the crimes laid against him so Festus is trying here to get Agrippa to do the Dirty Work to the Apostle Paul because basically Festus is saying he hasn't done anything wrong so I'm going to bring him to you verse number one Acts chapter 26. then Agrippa said unto Paul Thou Art permitted to speak for thyself remember Paul is a Roman so he has certain rights as a Roman and one of those rights is to be able to give his own testimony his own witness then Paul stretched forth the hand and answered for himself we've learned later that Paul's hands were bound so I wonder how he raised his hands here and beckon the people to listen he says this I think myself happy King Agrippa because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all things where I'm accused of of the Jews Paul is not afraid especially because I Know Thee to be an expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently so he's saying here that Agrippa is well versed in all the Jewish Customs because Agrippa himself is a Jew kind of my manner of life for my youth which was at the beginning at the first among my own Nation at Jerusalem know all the Jews my manner of life from my youth which was at the first among my own Nation know all the Jews so everybody knows me and everybody knows where I came from everybody all of these people that want to kill me they all know my history which knew me from the beginning if they would testify that after the most straightest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee now he's got a little dig in here because remember there's nobody testifying against Paul because there's no Witnesses in Roman law would say that these Witnesses if they if they're not just and true then they will suffer persecution so nobody stands up to to witness against Paul nobody's testify testifying against him but here he is and now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers this hope of the promise made of God under our fathers he is referring here to the Messiah that was to come unto which promise our 12 tribes instantly serving God day and night hope to come for which Hope's Sake O King Agrippa I am accused of the Jews why should it be thought a thing incredible with you that God should raise the Dead so Agrippa you're a Jew you know the story of this Christ you should know that God can raise the Dead you should know that there is a resurrection I verily thought with myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth now what Paul is about to do is something that is extremely extremely important for all of us to understand so Paul is coming here he's brought before this King and he in this this manifestus and in this King and and his sister and they're sitting in the Judgment seat and what does Paul do when he comes before them Paul gives his testimony next Sunday night we're going to have a testimony service and I'd like everybody to come I think it's going to be a real blessing we see that we were as I said before we were talking around the campfire um up up at our camp last weekend and the question I asked the question what what would encourage you to come more on Sunday night and more more on Wednesday what's important to you and the answer came back and it was a consensus we would like to hear more testimonies we'd like to like to be able to uh to take these things and apply them to our own lives and here Paul Paul is life is on the line he's about to be condemned to death and he doesn't go into Doctrine and say well Moses taught this and Abraham taught this and and this is where the Messiah is supposed to come and here's how he is Paul goes and he gives his own testimony he says here's what happened to me and I want to talk for a few minutes before we get back into Paul's Paul's um his testimony that friends we all need to have a testimony every one of us needs to have a testimony and that testimony is not what Paul's testimony was before that oh God sent a prophet or I believe this Bible I read my Bible every day or I listen to sermons I listen to tapes and I believe all these things that's not a testimony the testimony that you need to have is here is how I met Jesus Christ myself that is a testimony Paul had the same so-called testimony as he was growing up from a young child he believed the message of the prophets he was a Pharisee he believed all of the prophets with everything that he had he that was his testimony but he had not met Christ yet he had not met the Messiah and we need to be careful as Christians that we don't have a testimony and you say well I grew up and and I've always believed this and and I've always and I've always held this Bible and the highest esteem and I believe Jesus and and and I believe he sent a prophet and I believe all these things but have you met him think about that question do you have a testimony here's how I met Christ me if you came before this King Agrippa and you had to give a testimony what would it be would it be that I met Christ myself brother Branham said one time and he was quoting the Bible people say that that that um they have they've had an experience or not that they've had an experience but they believe and brother Branham responded with can a woman give birth and not know that she just gave birth and that is the new birth that is our testimony when I met Jesus Christ my life changed I met him personally and if you say well I've been growing up and I've always been a good person and I love the Lord but have you met him I cannot over emphasize how important that is have you met Christ yourself we hear so much of a about a personal relationship how can you have a personal relationship with someone that you have never met he's real Jesus Christ is real he died he rose again his Spirit came down at the day of Pentecost he entered into people they met him Cornelius the the Centurion the Gentile he met Christ he was filled with the Holy Ghost the all of the others disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit they met Christ they had the new birth so they have a testimony but I ask all of us do we have a testimony do our children have a testimony we protect them the best that we can we want to build a wall around them and and take care of them and and say none of this and none of this and cut everything out and and just protect them and then we see so often as soon as they get a little bit of Freedom they fly right into sin why is that because they don't have a testimony yet we do everything that we can to protect them and we want to protect them but we have we have to encourage them you have to know Christ yourself it's not what you don't do for Christ that matters it's what you do for Christ Paul here is saying he's going to give his testimony he's going to say this is what happened to me and no testimony let me tell you something no testimony is any greater than any others every one of us should have a testimony equal to Paul's this is when I met Christ it may not be that you got knocked off a horse and you went blind and you got healed and and then a a man with a prophetic gift in his life came and prayed for you and you you received your sight it may not be that but it's just as important whatever your testimony is and as parents raising our children we protect them watch over them do everything we can but they have to have their own relationship with God with Christ and we see it so often if they don't get it they leave and it's not because they fell away it's not because of they're not predestined or whatever nonsense that you hear it's because they didn't have a testimony yet they didn't meet Christ yet one of the best things I did without with with my children Stephanie and I we raise them we homeschooled them we didn't let them play with the neighbor kids we never went to movies we didn't we didn't have a television we didn't have any of that yet they still sinned why it was because they had not met Christ themselves no matter what you do no matter how much you try to protect them it will fail unless they meet Christ they must know the Lord Jesus that should be the center part of every family you meet him one of the best things I did in raising our children and it was hard for me to do you talk about legalistic this guy was legalistic and everything that we did and I and and I tell you the truth I would I change the way I did things I don't know what I would change but one of the best things I did and it's hard for me as I started telling my kids I want you to make that decision and they're like Oh Daddy just tell us what to do you know we don't want to do that you know and it's like and then Daniel I tell the kid I did not he want to go snowboarding with some of his friends didn't want him to go and I said well Bob I said you're going to have to make that decision does this please the Lord and he took it seriously and you know what he came back with yeah Dad it's okay if I go I was like wait wait I don't want you to go but he made that decision and he went and it was okay it went well and then I saw from that point on I see my children start to grow in their relationship with the Lord not because it was dad's decision anymore but it was because their decision and they had to suffer the consequences but it was their decision that they made and and it it came back on them and I saw that now they weren't relying on Dad anymore or Mom they were relying on their walk with the Lord did they make mistakes yes but it built and built and built let's read Romans 10. um Romans 10 13. I'd like to throw this in there Romans 10 13 the Apostle who's about to give his testimony he writes this to the church that was in Rome he says for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher now I know many many ministers will take that that scripture and they'll say oh see this is why we need the fivefold ministry because you've got to hear it from the pulpit and this wait a minute you're a preacher every day is your mama needs to be telling those kids all the time about the Lord Jesus Daddy needs to be telling them those are your preachers that they're always there always telling you it yes it needs to come from the pulpit but it needs to come from Mom it needs to come from Dad it needs to come from your brothers and your sisters it needs to come from your friends always talking about the lord always encouraging to you have your relationship with the Lord it will fail if you don't have a relationship with him if you don't have a testimony of how you met the Lord it will fail you must know Christ yourself Paul grew up he he grew up as a young man and he was always taught this Pharisee faith he's always taught to believe the message and to do as the prophets say and he did he did his best following exactly what the Bible said but he had not had that relationship with the Messiah yet he didn't know anything about it and I feel like so many people in the in in the message listen just because you know the God sent a prophet as our brother said this morning just because you believe him the Devils believe him too he's been let me tell you brother Branham kicked more Devils out of the church through through healings and casting out Devils they know him very well and they know he's a prophet so just because we know that God sent a prophet or just because we believe this Bible the devil believes this Bible also but we must know Jesus we need to have met him what was he said Jesus says one time he says many will come in my name Jesus Jesus name many will come in my name and said Lord did not I cast out devils in your name did I not I heal the sick did not not do this all these great works and Jesus will say depart from me get out I never knew you how could that be depart for me I never knew you speaking in Jesus name doing great things in Jesus name and he doesn't even know them think about it is that me is that you do you have a testimony have you met him when you come before when I come before the Lord Jesus am I going to be able to say Lord I met you on this day I met you here I sought you my whole life and you came to me Lord I had that experience I was I had that new birth I know you I'm a sinner of course deserving of hell but I know you and Jesus will say I know you I knew this person he or she gave her his or her life to me I met them in this case on the road to Damascus this Apostle Paul if they don't have that we can protect them as much as you can always we can build a wall around our children and it'll sneak in it'll sneak in through this this is this is the worst thing that we have and it sneaks in you think you're gonna protect your kids from it you're not it's going to come in and unless they have that testimony I met Christ I met God I know I am his I was baptized I I I'm here to serve him yes I sin but I know him unless we have that testimony and there are many people brothers and sisters there are many 70 80 year old people in this church and in every other Christian Church around the country around the world that don't know Christ they know a religion they know a message they know a Bible but they haven't met him personally the thing that meant the most to the Apostle Paul his life is on the line was his testimony it says this remember Paul was raised as a Pharisee he was raised to believe the Bible when Paul had his testimony when Paul had his conversion when Paul had his experience let me ask you this did he throw out everything that he learned in the Bible did he throw out when Moses said did he throw out what the prophet said no he never said he he never contradicted what any of the prophets said ever but now he knew why they said it Paul says this in verse 10. which thing I also did in Jerusalem and many of the Saints did I shut up in prison having received Authority from the chief priests did I skip a verse no verse 10. which thing I also did in Jerusalem and many of the Saints did I shut up in prison having received Authority from the chief priests and when they were put to death I gave my voice against them these Christians God's people I Paul persecuted them my voice was one that rang out against them I am Paul is saying I am that sinner Agrippa I'm the one that hated these people because they didn't believe like me I'm the one that hated these Christians I'm the one that wanted to put them to death think about how much you believe your religion would you take it as seriously enough to put somebody to death Paul did he was zealous for what he believed he was sincere and he was sincerely wrong and how he believed and I punished them often every synagogue and compelled them to blaspheme and being exceedingly mad against them I persecuted them even under strange cities those strains that means foreign cities look at Paul he said I compelled them to blaspheme the Pharisee that he was and Paul was encouraging them to sin even in his legalistic religion even in everything that he had taught from the prophets Paul said I compelled them to blaspheme what a statement from the apostle sitting under gamalia the greatest of the teachers Paul says I compelled him to blaspheme whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests at midday O King I saw in the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun shining round about me and them which journeyed with me and when we were we're all Fallen to the earth I Heard a Voice speak unto me and sang in the Hebrew tongue saw Saul why persecute us thou me it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks friends always praying about moving and and I didn't know what to do and I opened my Bible to that scripture and I looked at it I was just upset making a a great move and I didn't know what to do and I said Lord I don't know what that means why you're persecuting me it's hard for you to kick against the pricks I don't understand what that means and my mind went to kicking against a cactus and saying well yeah I can understand how that would not be such a great idea but then I looked and there was a note in my Bible that said kick against the goads I looked at it and I think I told this testimony before that that I was like against the goads what's a goad my mind went to shamgar and the ox goad and I I research that I looked and as I'm sitting in my chair and it's like five o'clock in the morning and I'm just torn up it's hard for you to kick against these goads and what it is is is that there's a a poker that a herdsman would have that it's it's on a stick and it's got a point on the end and when they're herding cattle or sheep or what it is that when they when they won't go where they they're supposed to go the shepherd will give them a poke the ox or or the the sheep or whatever it is and when you give them a poke if you see a cow they kick that's what it is and here is the Lord telling me my testimony this is me this is Daniel Evans how many times have I kicked against him no Lord that's not according to your word that is not these people are wrong and I kick and kick and kick and he's poking me and poking me and if if I would just go the way he said he wouldn't have to poke me but I did and I see like there it is Lord there is me and I'm the one that's been kicking at you why not because of sin not because I wanted to do something that that was would be considered sinful not because I wanted to to to leave the what brother brand I'm taught or not because I wanted to go into entertainment or look at something I shouldn't or any of that it was a religious spirit he's pushing me and saying you're fighting against me he's with Paul you're fighting against me because of your religious spirit fighting against God oh I think Lord I thought I was doing right I thought I was I thought I was serving you I was teaching your word I was I was I was I was zealous for your word and he's here and he's talking to a group and he's like I was the one that was wrong Agrippa and I said who art thou Lord and he said I'm Jesus whom thou persecuted but rise and stand upon thy feet for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness of these things which thou has seen and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee what things had Saul of Tarsus seen to that point he'd been guilty of murder he'd been guilty of blasphemy he had been guilty of all of these things that he would have never done knowingly remember the Ten Commandments Thou shalt not kill Paul in his zeal breaking the Commandments and sentence and persecuting people to death and that's your testimony it's my testimony it may not it may have been a dirty life that we lived it may have been mistakes it may not have been it may have been a religious spirit and we have done all of these things wrong and you can give witness to those things in your testimony but also give witness to what you have become Paul here is going to testify to Agrippa things are different Jesus continues and he's talking Paul is giving us testimony Jesus is talking delivering me from the people and from the Gentiles unto whom now I send thee to open their eyes and to turn them from Darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are Sanctified by faith that is in me whereupon O King Agrippa I was not disobedient under the heavenly vision I love that no matter how bad Paul was and everything that he did when Christ gave me the opportunity I was not disobedient to that heavenly vision I love that Lord let that be my testimony when you showed yourself to me I was not disobedient Lord I came when you called me but showed first unto them of Damascus and at Jerusalem and throughout all the coast of Judea and then to the Gentiles that they should repent and turn to God and do the works meet for repentance for these causes the Jews caught me in the temple and went about to kill me having therefore obtained help of God I continued unto this day witnessing both to small and great saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come oh now he's back and he's saying oh they're saying I didn't believe the message but I do I am testifying that the message that God sent is fulfilled in Jesus Christ Paul's saying that I am his witness I have it I have a testimony that Christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead and should show light unto the people and to the Gentiles and as he thus spake for himself Festus with a loud voice Paul Festus said with a loud voice Paul Thou Art beside thyself much learning doth make thee mad as he he didn't get it at all Paul's testimony was that he came to Christ first and that is the testimony of every Christian that has ever lived including you and me that I came to Christ not that I believe Moses not that I believed Abraham but that I came to Jesus Christ he had very wrong ideas before of what God was even in all of his studying and and everything that he he knew and he could quote the Bible better than anybody he could quote the message backwards and forward and it caused him to put other people down because they didn't see things like him he thought they were sinners because they didn't see the word of God the same as he did I really appreciate what our brother said this morning along the same lines I had no idea he was going to preach that and and I was thinking Lord I just I feel that this is Vindication then I'll continue on with what I've been teaching and will continue to teach so Festus interjection he says Paul you're crazy you're nuts all this studying you've done and learning under Gamaliel and and all of this it's made you crazy but he said I am not mad most noble Festus but I speak forth the words of truth and soberness for the king knoweth of these things before whom also I speak freely for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him for this thing was not done in a corner this Christianity thing and and all of my testimony Paul's saying hey it's it's out there for everybody to see and Paul says this remember I said how what a creep this Agrippa was and this weirdo sister he has Bernice King Agrippa believe it's thou the prophets I know that thou believest then Agrippa said unto Paul under Paul almost thou persuaded me to be a Christian and Paul said listen this what a bad person this Agrippa was that's why I said what I said earlier his lineage and his sister and all of this this guy was no good but look at the burden upon the apostle Paul said I would to God that not only thou but also all that hear me this day were both almost and all together such as I am except these bonds what a kind thing this Apostle says I wish that you had the same testimony as me King Agrippa with all of your sin and everything that you've done wrong and all and everything that you have done to all the children of Israel and your league with the Romans and your turn code and and how you've you've betrayed all of your people I wish that you had the same reward as I have accept I wish you didn't have to go through what I'm going through and when he had thus spoken the king rose up and the governor and Bernice and they that sat with them and when they were gone aside they talked between themselves saying this man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds look at the impact of Paul's testimony had on these people this man has done nothing that's worthy of death or even any type of imprisonment then set a grip onto Festus this man might have been said at Liberty if he had not appealed unto Caesar so Paul had already gone over their heads and they were obligated to send him for judgment sisters if we could come and close and brother Jonathan so they were saying that we've got to send him to be judged at Rome and their hearts had to feel bad and you see the kindness in Paul and the love it wasn't the Paul that that we've seen with uh when the high priest had him smacked in the face when he fought back this was love that Paul had even to these sinner people he says I wish you were like me I wish you had my testimony I wish you knew Jesus Christ like I know him except I wish he wouldn't have to suffer like I have to suffer suffer wow what a man this Apostle Paul was and he was so great because he had a testimony not just your raise right not just that you believe your Bible not just that you listen to tapes not just that that you're a good person remember what Jesus said he said you're going to come to me and you're going to say those things and I'm going to say depart from me because I never knew you if you don't have that testimony that you met Christ Brother David and raising our kids and how important it is and how much we love them and how much we try to protect them they don't know the Lord Jesus all of our efforts will be for naught it won't work it can't work but they have to they have to know Jesus Christ as I said Stephanie and I did our best and raising our kids and the Lord honored our prayers and he honored our love for our kids but our kids still sinned and they will if they don't know Christ how many testimonies have we heard that's why I chose Isaac Rosario and Jonathan I forgot his last name to minister at our youth meetings Jonathan had lived a terrible life drugs and and all kinds of bad things Isaac had lived a life what we would call squeaky clean but yet they were both they both had to have a relationship with Christ or both would have been lost and however hard we try if they don't know the Lord Jesus if they haven't met him personally then everything that we're teaching every time we teach them listen to tapes and read your Bible and pray and all this if they don't know him pray is different but if they don't know him then it's all lost they must have an experience they must have a new birth they must have Christ all of us [Music] and how we're raised in I believe I was raised good and and by the grace of God I didn't fall into into bad Sin but I still and everyone I know I still had to come to Christ and I think I was maybe in this same position as this apostle was sincere and zealous for what he believed standing strong here is what the prophet said I'll Stand Strong on that and yet was lost until he had that experience with Christ and all of our testimonies are just as great as Paul's if we meet Christ it's a necessity you hear so much about a personal relationship that's what it is and raising our kids that will hurt what did I do wrong didn't do anything wrong the fact is God was dealing with the young man or the young lady or whoever it is and God had his time and we just try to protect him until God gets a hold of them and then when he does they'll still sin they'll still do things wrong but I don't worry about my boy anymore I don't worry about my girl anymore because I know God's got a hold of him I know he has a testimony this is how I came to Christ I don't care if you're 90 years old or you're 12 years old if you don't have a testimony then you need to seek it you need to seek that conference with God you need to seek that experience you need to seek that new birth because it doesn't matter that you've lived a good life you've still sinned Paul lived a better life I guarantee you than anyone else in this room yet he was still lost until he met Christ [Music] me too but I know him sister Shirley and I know on that day it's not going to be uh he preached the gospel he he led many Souls it's not going to be any of that it's gonna be I knew him Daniel Evans I knew him I know him because I met him and he met me might not be on the road to Damascus might be on Oracle Road there's a lot of people on Oracle Road that need to meet him but we have to have that if you don't have it seek it first way baptism through the ordinances of God seek Him the Bible says to seek God while he is near so friends it's vitally important as I've said as a parent you do your best but they need a preacher to get them to Christ and I'm not talking about the guy in the pulpit I'm talking about Mama talking about daddy talking about all of us amen let's all stand [Music] go ahead Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary [Music] with

early [Music] signs [Music] for you the top our heads think about the Lord think about how important it is that we have that testimony that we have that place that we have driven that stake down say Lord you met me on that road to Damascus I will never forget that and when I give a testimony when I want to witness to someone I can say here is my testimony as the Apostle Paul did before Agrippa this is my testimony [Music] if you want to meet this same Jesus Christ that I know here's how it happened to me and I would [Music] that you would meet the same one that I have met to me I hear so many great testimonies I I hear how people have come out of crime or drugs or whatever it is but to me the greatest testimony is when someone can say I lived a good life I did my best I didn't fall into sin I made mistakes and I did wrong my parents taught me and I I did my best but on this day this happened to me and here is my testimony I love I love it when I hear that kind of testimony and I was protected and I believed but there was a day when Jesus Christ came into my heart and gave me that new birth if you haven't had that testimony seek it our lord is good same God that loved Paul that came to him on the road to Damascus is the same God that loves you and me precious Heavenly Father Lord as we just bow our heads before you this evening Lord Lord we're so thankful for when we
