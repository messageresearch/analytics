to the time where we can count the years is months the months is weeks and the weeks is days amen any any day now we're going home amen if you have your bibles while you're standing with us we'll invite you to the book of joshua the 24th chapter uh we want to look there again in joshua the 24th chapter we want to greet you this evening the name of the lord we sure want to say it's a been an honor and privilege to be with you all once again and to be able to speak to you here from the message of the hour and i have this privilege to be here with you again at the tucson tabernacle and we

this weekend and it's not her first time being in arizona but we're sure glad to have her here with us again she was telling me i think brother arnie that her family came here on vacation several years ago and i believe your dad took him on the tour and around the area here so we sure appreciate that and it's good to good to be back in the house of lord this eve today man we want to look here in the book of joshua the 24th chapter we want to look in the 14th verse again i trust if we just continue on with our thought from this morning just a few more things here on my heart i'd like to share with you joshua 24 and verse number 14. the bible here says now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity notice your way also says and in truth so not just in sincerity but in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in egypt and serve ye the lord and if it seems evil unto you to serve the lord then choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites and whose land you dwell let's read this together but as for me and my house we will serve the lord as for me and my house we will serve the lord i also want to look again with you in the book of john the 9th chapter we read this morning from the 26th verse up to about the 35th verse but if we can i'd like to just back up there a few verses maybe to the 20th verse this evening and we'll try to try to get this in tonight in john 9 and verse 20 as we said this morning the lord has just healed this boy that was born blind and now there's a great stir confusion whatever you want to call the in the community or in the the area there and he's going to have to take sides hey man and here in the 20th verse it says here's his parents answered them and said we know that this is our son and that he was born blind but by what means he now seeth we know not or who hath opened his eyes we know not he is of age ask him he shall speak for himself so his parents is one side then the lord jesus is the other side and now this young boy is in the middle he's the he's the deciding factor he's the choosing here notice here in the 22nd verse these words spake his parents because they fear the jews for the jews that agreed already that if any man did not confess that he was christ he should be put out of the synagogue therefore said his parents he is of age ask him then again they called the man that was blind and said unto him give god the praise we know that this man is a sinner he answered and said whether he be a sinner or no i know not but one thing i know i love this one thing i know that whereas i was blind now i see whereas i was blind now i see let's bow our hearts together this evening heavenly father lord your word is true tonight and lord what an honor and a privilege it is just to be able to read your word lord just to be able to look in the scriptures tonight and know that we're not reading as we said through the glasses of denomination through the glasses of tradition through the glasses of some man's opinion the lord we are reading this bible tonight through prophetic glasses lord that you've allowed a prophet to come in this generation and to interpret what we're reading so father i pray tonight you would come speak to our hearts change our lives by your word anoint us afresh tonight god lord help me to get myself out of the way lord move me aside that your people could receive from the gift that you've placed on the inside of my life lord may you not just move me aside to minister but lord may you move the people aside as well to pull and to receive and lord whatever is accomplished in this meeting we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our lord and our savior jesus christ we pray and all the believers said amen god bless you this evening as you you have your seats there for just a few moments you love the lord amen from those scriptures again this evening i'd like to if i can to minister to you and maybe just continue on with the same title of taking sides with the supernatural taking sides with the supernatural and as we were maybe just to lay a foundation for some that wasn't here this morning the bible here was re-reading about taking sides and the prophet of god tells us that you're either against god or you're for god you're either against god or you're for god and brother brahma says actually how in this day and time that we take sides is not necessarily by maybe the clothes we wear the pictures we have the tire but the way we take sides is by believing his word now as we were looking here as the word supernatural actually means it means of a manifestation or an event attributed to some force that goes beyond scientific understanding or the laws of nature manifestations or events considered to be of supernatural origin such as ghosts and we agreed this morning we're not following any kind of ghosts but we're following the holy ghost and he is a supernatural spirit now maybe where we left off this morning we were speaking on the difference in supernatural and superstition how many how many knows there's a difference the definition of superstition means a widely held but unjustified belief in supernatural causation leading to a certain consequence of an action or event it's a practice that's based on such a belief now if you if you look there another word for the word superstition is idolatry which is uh the worship of anything outside of the lord jesus christ now we find that many people today they worship they worship the church they worship the preacher they worship this even around the message you'll find some that worship amen the prophet but that's not what god has called us to do he's called us to believe his word amen and to cast down every idol that stands between you and the living god now jeremiah the 10th chapter in the second verse the bible there says thus saith the lord learn not the way of the heathen and be not dismayed at the signs of the heaven for the heathen are dismayed at them now the prophet said again god approaches his people by signs and wonders therefore the word heathen is actually interpreted by the interpretation is unbeliever now he said see the learn not the way of the heathen or learn not the way of the unbeliever stay away from him see don't fellowship with it at all he's an unbeliever let him be marked an unbeliever can light in darkness exist at the same time can it be dark when the sun is shining never right he said which is the most powerful can dark put out the sun no sir the sun puts out the darkness see light y'all forgive me a voice is a little weak tonight that's right he says and wrong so wrong can never exist in the state of truth and neither can a lie exist in the face of the truth think of that wrong can never exist in the face of the truth neither can a lie exist in the face of the truth now the truth is always the same it meant a lie actually twist around but it's still a lie so the truth remains the same but a lie is twisted to something else now in the messenger sign of his coming he said it's just like taking a wire connecting it with a dynamo where there's no current taking a wire and sticking it in a socket he said there's no currency it's the difference it's just a dead wire no matter how much sockets in there if there's no current in there it's still a dead wire and as long as we're trying to connect it with something that hasn't got any life in it or any truth in it it'll still be a dead thunder with no lightning in it that's right he said unbelievers amen have no life in them to believe with how many knows tonight that an unbeliever is actually a dead current it's there's nothing there that when the supernatural comes to connect with it and believe now amen i'm going to preach amen the devil come out of my throat but this ain't the first time we've been through this so we'll get through it again amen but the scoffers are actually unbelievers right amen the scoffers are unbelievers and the prophet said what they're trying to do is they're trying to discourage the believer they're trying to discourage the believer now in second peter chapter 3 verse 4 the bible says where is the promise of his coming you realize that's the question they're even asking today is where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep he says all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation now in the mat the message the rapture i just want to read this because it'll it'll it'll maybe get your mind thinking in this direction he said look as he just blacked out the pope just come over here remember the tabernacle got taped he says i guess you all got them he said how the lord showed that that day in the tabernacle exactly the church ages would be where they would be had them drawn out on the board up here he said and if the holy spirit didn't come down in a big pillar of fire and went right back there on the wall and drawed them out himself he said well three or four hundred people sitting there looking at it and just as the pope started over here he said the moon somehow blackened out and they took their pictures the same way that was drawn up there on the platform he said now he's made a trip on the 13th walk 13 steps serve communion to 13 to a nation that's number 13. he said see blackout's coming everywhere don't you see where we're at we are at the end time don't you see we're at we're at the end time so when we come to the end time then is the time you're going to see scoffers rise in the last days saying there's no difference in the time than it what it was than when our fathers fell asleep but when you see these things begin to happen then raise up your head and get ready ain't then something could happen at any time he said christ come for his church so when the unbelievers are becoming discouraged by the signs of the heaven by the signs of the earth by the signs of the time when the unbelievers are becoming discouraged that's the time that the believers are becoming encouraged by this time amen the same signs that are discouraging the unbeliever the prophet said that word dismayed comes from the word discouraged the unbeliever is discouraged he said what with the signs of heaven he said it just makes the unbeliever just pout and angry he said when you speak about signs and wonders they don't believe it amen so don't learn their ways stay away from them amen you learn the word and you stay with the word for the word is truth amen now see the signs from heaven are actually he meant the believer's encouragement now the prophet said this way it encourages the believer why because he believes the word it encourages the believer in the scriptural truth and then if we can show you here in the scripture that this generation will see the coming of the lord but you say are you sure that well just look to see what the signs point to see how close we are if the signpost says you're nearing just a few miles away you better get ready because it may be just a few hours so when you begin to see the signs amen pointing to the destination that's not the time to fall away that's not the time to grow cold amen that's the time to get ready for the coming of the lord is at hand amen then to think tonight amen that we have not come here under superstition signs amen but we have come here under supernatural signs as the prophet said light and darkness cannot exist at the same time he said therefore one of one has got to give way to the other see either the light is going to give away to the darkness or the darkness is going to give way to the light he said see that's what happened up there the other day on superstition mountain we were sitting out there i'd heard it for a long time heard how many legends had been told about the superstition i remember looking at it the first time it was before day and a great ghosty shadow hung at the east of me which was known as the superstition heard about the indians how they wouldn't go near it how they were afraid the spanish mistreated them he said they claimed that evil spirits lived in it amen and all this stirred my curiosity amen but i only had a flashlight to see superstition first he said see and then i watched until after a while the majesty of the sun somebody shout the majesty of the sun begin to move upon the darkness see all he had was a flashlight but when the majesty of the sun began to move upon the darkness when it did it separated amen the darkness from the light he meant when the majesty of the sun began to move he meant it separated the darkness from the line he said and it pressed the darkness back and finally she raised her highness up over the top of the mountain and it showed superstition what it was it lit up and showed what it was and all the spooks and fears that i had of the superstition when the sun was shining in its power all of that fled away amen see so what happened was a prophet could only see amen so much of superstition amen by a flashlight he meant but when a prophet got the sign amen it revealed there was nothing to it amen and you catch there amen a prophet says when the sun began to rise amen superstition began to go back amen and reality of what it was begin to come into plain view amen now fake it not strange that a prophet preached the message it is amen the rising of the sun amen what was the rise of the sun for amen to drive back the darkness amen that was hanging over the church that was hanging over the bible that was hanging over the word and let you see amen that the word of god amen it's not denominational fanaticisms amen it is not traditions it is the word made manifest amen it separates the light from the darkness see when the king light of the bible raises up all the superstitions and things we know it's a vindicated proves this lie he said when you see that then you have no more room to argue superstition is now gone amen when you see the light when you see the word there's no more room to argue superstition is now gone and supernatural has come on the scene amen see so therefore the unbeliever is discouraged amen but the believer is encouraged amen now let me just take a moment here and preach you for a second amen because sometimes amen we let things we go through amen take our joy away and we become amen the discouraged when we should be the encouraged we become the down when we should be the up we become the we we become the broken when we should be amen the healed are you following me tonight amen see tonight church is not the hour for the bride to be discouraged this is the hour for the bride to be encouraged amen seek the spirit of the unbeliever it always cries out amen with discouragement it always cries out with a question you look there in matthew 21 verse 10 and when he was coming to jerusalem all the city was moved amen saying who is this right and then this is in the bible saying who is this and the preachers of that day had to give an account for this stir because it was the feast of the passover and they screamed out who is this when the heir was charged he said the coming of the lord jesus to jerusalem had charged the air with expectations it looked like the teachers ought to know what was going to take place it looked like that the high priest would have known it it looked like all the other priests would have known it amen and it isn't changed any today because the holy spirit is forerunning amen the coming of the lord jesus and as the holy spirit begins to stretch out he meant across the earth revival fires are broken out everywhere great signs and wonders are being done he said prophecies have gone forth and all the gathering of the apostolic blessing just come back to the church again he said the spirit of the unbeliever still cries out amen who is this amen they can see the signs they can see the wonders they can see the prophecies they can see all these things lining up but because they're discouraged by these things and then they cry out and say who is this amen can i say it like this when the spirit of the believer cries out they come of the unbeliever amen cries out a question then the spirit of the believer amen cries out an answer amen they say who is this and the believer says it's jesus christ amen the same yesterday today and forever amen see now what we've got to do then is we've got to get all the spooks out amen right we've got to get all the spooks out amen and create an atmosphere amen for the supernatural to come into amen see we've got to let the light of god's word drive back all the darkness brought back all the fears and let the light of god's word come in the church in first kings 8 verse 10 it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place that the cloud filled the house so that the great priest could not stand the minister because of the cloud for the glory of the lord had filled the house amen notice here the atmosphere then is what brings the results amen it's the attitude of the people that brings the results that's the reason that pentecostal had to go into an upper room and pray until the holy ghost came because they got in one place and one accord it's the atmosphere is what brings the results let every man and woman in this building this morning boy girl at everything amen get out of your minds but the lord jesus and believe that he's standing amen present now and you'll see something happening that'll cause headlines in the newspaper in the morning that's right it's the atmosphere it's the atmosphere that brings the miraculous and wonders and powers of god among the people see so when you get the atmosphere you get the people in the atmosphere amen of worship and believing that all things are possible now watch this here the desire the end of a divine life is to stay in the atmosphere of the supernatural look at what david said in psalms 27 4 he said one thing have a desire to the lord that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple he said see that's the reason sometimes that a divine life has been called and set aside has become a fanatic or crazy he said to the eyes of the general public it's because you're considered a neurotic or an insane person he said but what's happened is you've changed amen your dwelling place and you've got into a different atmosphere and your own motive your own thoughts is to stand that atmosphere and any person that ever comes in that atmosphere one time will never be satisfied amen nowhere else that's why i believe we should have our churches under the control of the holy ghost that men and women in their work wherever they should be should continually desire and they will if they ever come into that atmosphere one time amen if you ever get in the atmosphere amen of a good old-fashioned amen holy ghost revival atmosphere amen a cold church service won't satisfy you if you ever taste of the blessings of god amen then the curses of the devil amen will never satisfy are you hearing me when you ever break through and get into an atmosphere amen something is going to change amen see the body of christ amen cannot live in a natural atmosphere they've got to be in a supernatural atmosphere why because the body of christ is a supernatural body right in first corinthians 12 12 for as the body is one and has many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body also also as christ amen for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been made all to drink of one spirit he said the world is again falling apart the church is ready she is sealed in she's ready to come he said there will be a big outpouring of the spirit yes sir to grab the church and take her in the skies amen because see the church and the word and the bride in christ his ministry is in his bride amen which is his body he said the supernatural body of the of of his here on the spiritual body on earth his spirit is in there living his life right out until him and the church becomes one see that's we're at tonight amen is the body has moved out of a natural atmosphere has moved out of a superstitious atmosphere into a supernatural atmosphere and we have become one with christ now it's amazing when you begin to look amen i'm not going to get very deep in this but it's amazing when you begin to look at the natural body and all the functions of a natural body you'll find many times amen that there's that same type in the spiritual body see like the natural body has a backbone do you realize without a backbone amen your natural body you couldn't even stand up you couldn't move you couldn't function you wouldn't know what to do amen see so the spiritual body has got to have a backbone as well he meant now the backbone of the supernatural body amen is those divinely revealed mystery truths in saint matthew chapter 13 verse 10 and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in parables and he answered and said to them because it is given unto you which is his disciples to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given he said see then what is a mystery a mystery is a previously amen hidden truth now divinely revealed which is but yet the supernatural element still remains amen despite the revelation now amen i i'm not going to hold you along tonight but let me say it like this amen i think sometimes even we've only come so far with this message and we refuse to go any further there's some people that as far as they've come it's god sent a prophet and that's all they talk about that's all they see that's all they want to hear that's all they want to preach amen but if you're going to take a rapture you've got to see that there's more to this message amen than just the first pool there is more to this i can pull amen but a prophet says amen there is a third pool which is the opening of the word he meant the mysteries of the bible revealed in john 14 26 he said the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you amen all things and bring all thanks to your remembrance amen whatsoever i've said unto you now notice here in the brotherhood says this in the revelation of jesus christ you recall that i mentioned at the beginning of this message of this book we are studying is the actual revelation of jesus you believe that himself in the church and his work in the future ages then i mentioned that it takes the holy spirit amen to give us revelation or we will fail to get it now bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't just take even ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it's going to take the operation of the holy ghost amen so therefore the holy ghost was not just operating in the first pool he was not just operating in the second pool but the same holy ghost that operated in the first pool operated in the second pool is the same holy ghost that is here today operating in the third pool of a message ministry he said see bringing these two thoughts together it's going to take the holy ghost that means this book cannot be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it'll take one with prophetic inside it'll require the ability amen to hear from god brother aaron it'll require even supernatural instructions not just a student amen comparing verse with verse though that is good he meant but a mystery requires amen the teaching of the spirit or it will never become clear how we need to hear from god and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know amen so therefore the spirit of truth amen is coming in this last days now notice here amen some people make they think when you begin to preach the message and you begin to preach that amen that third paul you begin to preach they open the word you begin to preach the seals and you begin to go in those areas that a prophet laid out they think well you're going out there and there's no supernatural but a prophet there said amen those those mysteries are divinely revealed amen despite the supernatural element still remains is that what he said amen despite it now notice here then the spirit of truth is not going to come and teach you away from the supernatural but it's going to bring you to the recognition of the supernatural and by revelation you'll understand what you are seeing amen how many knows when you have a question it requires an answer amen if there's a question there's going to be an answer now notice here a natural question cannot be satisfied with a supernatural answer neither can a supernatural question amen be satisfied with a natural answer therefore and i'm not going to i'm not going to preach on this or relax but marriage and divorce amen the prophet god says it like this he said first corinthians the seventh chapter he said the new testament prophet paul then he goes on to moses where moses permitted and god recognized it righteous and paul also had a right when he filmed the church in that condition he said now you believe this to be true you believe it to come from god and by the vindication of this cloud and his message has brought me this far should not god upon this mountain permit me to do the same thing amen to suffer you to go on the way you are and do it no more go with your wives live in peacefully hours late the coming of the lord is at hand we haven't got time to break these things up don't you dare try it i'm speaking only to my congregation and god bore me witness on that mountain that i could say this is a supernatural revelation amen right here in the state of arizona amen there was another word prophet who went in the mountain are you following me tonight amen moses was separated and he went in the desert to receive the revelation amen paul was separated and he went in the dancer to receive the revelation and william branham was separated and he come in the desert to receive the revelation come on church amen we should not be sad tonight amen we should not be oh i'm going to preach or i'm going to bust amen we should not be so dry that you got to pump everybody up to say amen listen church we have received amen a divine supernatural revelation from jesus christ listen we are not here tonight hoping we are not here tonight probably we have come under amen the spirit of truth and his promise to restore amen all that has been lost to the church then to think tonight friends we are not the beneficiaries amen of a second hand revelation but the same god amen that met paul and delivered a firsthand revelation has come in this generation and delivered to the church he meant a supernatural answer amen to supernatural questions a supernatural understanding amen the things that were confused for years oh church we might as well ring the liberty pale tonight we might as well at least put one amen out and say we got the answer we've got the answer tonight by the supernatural when i think of that it absolutely blows my mind when you see amen the types when you see that this message is more than just the man behind the pulpit amen it's more than just 1100 tapes it's more than just stories it's more than just testimonies it is the fulfillment of the spirit himself teaching the church through the channel of a prophet now i'll say it like this i believe it's a blessing to be around the supernatural i believe it's a blessing to be under supernatural teaching amen the brother said now this here speaking of when jesus went there in the temple he went in there and spoke remember and they said what what manner of man is this he's astonished all these people he said now the supernatural is what blinds me isn't that something the same answer that opened your eyes blinded others the same message that give you understanding put other people in confusion now notice here it has in all ages but isn't it marvelous to think where the supernatural is demonstrated where the eagles are the carcasses rather and the eagles will be gathered through the age it has been that way men walk in slumber of life and they hear their teaching and their philosophies and so forth and that teach theologies but that still don't satisfy amen the human heart he said but when the supernatural comes into view like it in the days of our lord jesus when jesus came on the scene with his power and the manifestation of god the people flocked him to here because it's something in the realms beyond amen see it's something coming from the realms beyond into this realm and all men know that soon all education is god's and theology and so forth will rot in the grave we know that but where the supernatural is it pierces beyond the grave amen see the supernatural cannot be put in a grave it cannot be put behind the denominational stone it cannot be cut down by a roman tree amen the supernatural goes beyond he said but some believe him and those who believe was saved and those who believe could get healed but if jesus himself was standing here wearing my suit and my shoes he could not help you any more tonight than he can in the form of what he's doing now you know that the bible said the place he went into that that many works he could amen could not could not do because of their unbelief amen now notice here so the manifestation amen of the supernatural is going to cause people amen to take sights they may notice here when brother branham was going around amen healing the sick amen discerning the thoughts everybody was talking to the ministry but when that third pull came in operation when that opening the word began to take place when the seals began to come open amen when the thunders begin to sound amen then they begin to draw a line and say we'll go with healing and we'll go with discernment but we will not stand for these teachings amen but i'm so glad that there was an elected gene seed of god that said if he was right in the healings he'll be right in the discernments and if he was right in the discernments he is riding his doctor i'll tell you tonight that's one of the biggest compounds they've got right is you can follow him so far but what do they all say near the end he went off near the end he lost it near the end he began preaching strange things but it was not strange things it was the supernatural coming in the church and teaching the church beyond intellectual beyond education into the realities of christ amen i'll tell you tonight friends amen this message has been vindicated it has been manifested it has been proven it has been told it has been believed it has been over and over and over seen to defeat the devil anywhere anytime under any condition what are you saying i'm saying now's the time amen to take a stand amen now's the time amen to choose a side you say well brother andrew give it a few more years and i'll see if i can believe this message what greater time to believe it than tonight amen what greater time amen to give yourself to it than right now amen amen see that's what happened there in john 9 that blind man had to take sides he either had to take sides with jesus or against jesus amen see the people tried them pharisees and sadducees now this is amazing and herodians all tried to cast a shadow on jesus but them true believers they meant them true believers that was predestinated to hear that message heard it and seen no fault in it the pharisees seen it the herodians saw it amen the sadducees heard it and they everyone found fault in it but the predestinated they heard it they saw it they believed it and they found no thought in it he said the same now amen those who believe him those who love him those who believe him see no fault in him they don't see any heresy they don't see anything wrong they don't see anything wrong with his word they don't see anything wrong with his people they just see jesus they're predestinated to eternal life so they just take sides with jesus and they stay there hey amen can i amen can i take a survey here for a second how many season he fought in this message how many seasons he fought in jesus how many seasons he fought in this bible you don't see that you know why because it's not there amen but how many sees a perfect word how many seeds are perfect blood how many seeds of perfect atonement how many seas amen a perfect interpretation of the written word amen then you know what you're obligated to do when you see it you're obligated to take sides with it amen and draw your sword and say i'll stand for jesus and let the world go by amen i'll claim these promises and he will supply there is a church in the last days that is not going to bow she is not going to turn away she is not just serving god in sincerity she is serving god in sincerity and in truth all denominations brother they all claim sincerity amen sincere sincere sincerity amen but come to the truth they don't want nothing to do with the truth amen but this bride wants the truth amen she loves the truth why because the truth is what set her free amen we're out this evening even somebody shout we're out we're out of the valley of decision hey amen we're not here tonight amen trying to decide if we should serve the lord trying to decide if we should believe him trying to decide that we should go back to the other side of the flood we have come to the other side amen we have seen christ come down and vindicate and there's no fault in him my amen now notice this he says you never know where to stand a man that's unstable like that he said or a person that professes to be a christian and that unstable you don't know what to do about that person today they're a christian tomorrow you don't know where they're at he said see in church today they're rejoicing and singing and praising god and tomorrow out drinking corrals and running around then that type of part that type of person is hard to do anything with amen now notice why even because they've not made a true stand they have not come to a clear-cut decision right now the bible says in james chapter 1 verse 8 that a double-minded man is unstable which means restless in all his ways now what does that word double-minded mean it means wavering uncertain doubting now this here's a good one divided in interest a double-minded man is divided in his interest so so he's partly interested in the message and then partly interested in what's going on in nominational realms and then partly feed from a prophet and partly feeding from a theologian amen but but see you'll never make a stand that way you'll never make a stand for god you've got to come to a place where the prophet says a man once anchors his heart against the heart of calvary all devils in hell will never shake him no more he's there see he claims god to be his father when he's not just tossed about by every wind of doctrine not stable don't know where you're going double minded and a lot of times he says double tying don't know where you're standing or what you're talking about he said but a man that's been born again of the spirit of god knows exactly where he's at amen see a double-minded man is never able to come to the knowledge of the truth now think of this amen never able to come to a place of assurance never able to come to a place of confidence never able to come to a place where everything else is false and the message is the truth now i want to i want to show you something here the bible says amen that paul actually had to come amen to a new birth you believe that paul had to have a new birth now notice what the new birth did amen the new birth caused paul amen to change sides he meant the new birth caused paul to go from the side amen of persecuting the christians amen to the side of preaching to the christians amen see the the new birth caused paul amen to move into a place where he was no longer amen acting out on every man's command if the man said go down and kill the christians paul did it if they said go persecute him paul did it amen but after he took a stand after he took a stand after he come to a place where he anchored his heart against calvary he no longer listened to what man told him to do but he became in tune with the holy ghost and acted only upon what god spoke to him to do now you say brother andrew how amen can i take a stand today when i can't hear the voice of god oh don't fool yourself amen the same voice amen that was walking in the garden in genesis the third chapter is the same voice that walked from genesis 3 amen to revelation 10 7 and the bible says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel and he shall begin to sound amen the voice of god they say how we know it's the voice of god because then it was in a vindicated prophet but now today it's the voice of god because it's the manifestation of the prophet's words he said this is god's prophet and a true voice of god only brings back that real living supernatural god there it is again with this supernatural word with the supernatural manifestation of the true word then we know it's the voice of god there's so much other in the other realms that just deadens that out but the voice of god amen the voice of revelation 10 7 has brought back the supernatural god with his supernatural word with a supernatural manifestation listen friends the voice of god is not here tonight amen to discern so much as it was when william branham was here but the voice of god is here tonight amen to call believers to a decision amen notice here in deuteronomy 30 amen the spirit of the lord spoke there that day in verse 15 see i have set before thee this day life and good amen death and evil verse 19 i call heaven and earth to record against this day against you i have set before you life and death amen how many knows there's been life set before the church and death set he said i've set before you blessed and cursive notice what he says therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live amen brother says you must choose you a leader yes sir choose today amen choose life or death your choice will determine your eternal destination and to follow him to eternal life you must come on his terms that's right his word amen see there's a blessing then to those who will choose life there's a blessing then to those who will choose amen the blessings of god amen do you realize here tonight amen if you're a young man or a young lady do you realize your choice tonight has got the power amen to follow you in the marriage it's got the power to follow you amen into your children amen by your choice here tonight was that not what the bible says the bible said choose life that thou and thy seed may be blessed amen see the prophet then is telling you you've got to come amen to a public confession you've got to come to a public stand you've got to come and know beyond the shadow of a doubt that nobody can turn you around nobody can back you in a corner are you with me nobody can twist the word to you nobody can lead you against what god has revealed to you when you take a stand when you make a stand nobody can lead you differently now i'll just sit like this i don't believe at times you stay the message and you hear the brand preach the messages i don't believe that he was just actually preaching sermons i don't believe he was just pulling things out of the air i believe there was a divine order i believe there was a i believe there was a leadership there of why he was preaching when he was preaching in the order he was preaching amen here's one that i love and then you go look in there and you'll find there's a tape called the conflict between god and satan then the next sermon is taking sides with jesus the conflict between god and satan then taking sides with jesus you know what his text was amen in the conflict between god and satan it was joshua 24. if it seemed evil unto you choose you this day whom he will serve now the prophet says it this way the conflict is between god and satan the conflict is not between you and satan see you are the deciding factor and your victory comes from making a decision from taking sides now i want to read this to you amen prophet god says in conflict between god and satan satan in eden when he first come to this attack to attack the person on the children of god was fortified with the word he never attacked the being he attacked the word first look at that sneaker look at that lizard what does he do today the first thing he can't lay it on and say well that's not a good person but the only thing he tries to do no matter how good the person is is to get them to deny the so he attacks the word then the person but he attacks the person by getting the word amen denied to the person are you with me so satan satan tried to attack the word in the garden of eden so he had to have something now that he could use to the human being that would look better than the word see he had to have something that would look better to the human being that word and do you know what he used he used reasoning which is common sense so notice here then this great warfare amen is between right and wrong which it started in heaven oh god it started in heaven and between god the creator and lucifer the perverter now notice here lucifer pulled amen a third part of the angels and they took sides with him and by taking sides with him they failed and the problem of god tells his greatest battle ever fought angelic battles then drop down into human battles see now if you read revelation 12 4 it says in his tale amen drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth now the prophet of god picks this up and says notice in revelation 12 he give a picture of a woman stand the moon in her head the sun at her head the moon under her feet the red dragon stood to devour the child as soon as it was born and he took his tail and pulled a third part of the stars and cast them to the earth did you notice that now that doesn't mean that aren't you thankful for a prophet now that doesn't mean that he notices that he had a long tail that he hooked around the people he didn't take his tail through heaven and find about third party angels and say now y'all follow amen i'm gonna hook you with my tail no the prophet said it was not his tale but the tle that he told it was the tale that he told and pulled the third part of those stars he said notice here who is the bride and morning star jesus of nazareth he said then watch here amen ever jesus natural is the brightest never lived in human flesh he is the right morning star he is the seat of abraham come to isaac and when he being dead and christ take on abraham's seed and her heirs according to the promise now watch the stars of the heaven represented the spirits of men here and when the red dragon roam under its persecution hugged in two-thirds of the stars cast him down that was at the crucifixion of our lord jesus when they rejected him and cast him out had nothing to do with him that was the third part of the angelic stars he says the angelic beings now watch here when satan calls this fall when he told his tale amen that to see the third part of the angels the proud of god said that opened up two sides it was the side of reasoning which was the devil's tale amen or to stay with thus saith the lord then satan out there's two sides there's the side of the devil's tail the same telly told eve it's the same till he told cain right it's the same tale he's been telling for years amen and people have taken that side but then there is another side and that side is called thus saith the lord amen notice here the word always in front of them always thus saith the lord notice you're the word of god there's no way around it everywhere thus saith the lord but you know in order to believe the devil's lie you have to ignore and deny god's truth before you can believe the devil's lie see you ever think of that you have to deny the truth before you could believe a lie notice here then to resist the devil's lie is what you're called to do can i say it like this you're actually anointed amen to resist the devil's lie and take sides with god's promised word oh i love this in saint john 14 23 if any man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him he that loveth not me keep it not my sayings and the word which you hear he says is not mine but the fathers which sent me now notice here the church how many believers are the church must believe every word every promise every iota and claim it for themselves and exercise themselves in it see if god sends his church gifts then we should take those and not say they're not so but say they are so and believe them the real church keeps the promises notice here so then the fir and i'm bringing this to a close but the first human beings actually disfellowship themselves from god how did they disfellowship themselves from god by believing the devil's lie by believing the devil's tale the same tale he told amen to get a third part of the angels to fall with him was the same tell he told amen to get thieve and adam disfellowship from god he said see no one can believe the devil's lie until they have disbelieved god's truth see amen notice here amen you realize alive don't a stop get started i heard it said like this one time a lie will be around the world before the truth gets its shoes on right now watch this amen the lie that the devil told he didn't change it he told that same lie to eve but says he came and told cain that same lie he said it's the same lies told down to the ages look here in genesis 4 1 i knew eva's wife and she conceived and bear came and what did she say i have gotten a man from the lord she did not attribute the son to satan for that would have made him equal with god only god created the egg in the womb of mary satan couldn't do that he knew that satan can only pervert so he beguiled her with the wrong seed she believed that cain was from god she accepted the devil's lie as god's true tote that is exactly what we have now now i'm skipping a whole lot between then and now but he says that's exactly what we have now is churches set themselves up as fountains of truth but the truth is not in them yet their begotten children swear by them and will even kill to uphold their error all based off of the same lie that he told the third part of the angels come down in the garden and to leave it's the same lie are you following me it's the same lie that he told eve when she said i've gotten a man from the lord and he comes all the way to today every and he says that's the same lie that many of these churches are built upon he said the men at the church moved towards form and ceremony and towards priesthood by organizing the ministers into a group that decided leadership apart from the holy spirit's word that very moment death entered in and she got started to get sick and as she got sick she changed to a powerless group of people whose only weapon was argument all coming from the devil's lie you tap with god he says and you reap exactly what you injected man i'll learn that from nature he has injected his own ideas into nature and rearranged molecules and now he is reaping a whirlwind he said now if you fool with nature and get a monstrosity as a backfire what will happen he says if you change amen the truth into a lie see notice if you flew with nature amen and changed nature into a monstrosity he said then what will happen if you change the truth into a lie the answer is you will breed an antichrist godless system a religion that is so perverted it'll look like or produce what the original did the only answer god has for a situation like that is the lake of fire are you hearing me church amen don't worry i'm not going to preach all night okay amen watch this amen the only answer amen for the devil's lie that come down the garden and was told to eve that was told to cain that's been told for thousands of years that's been told amen to churches today that has established themselves upon antichrist teachings upon men's opinions he said the only answer for that is a lake of fire amen but come on church amen that discourages the unbeliever that all the discouraged ain't been the person that's believing the devil's lie but i'm not discouraged tonight because james said submit yourselves therefore to god and resist the devil and he will flee amen let me put it out tonight extra extra read all about it i was born and ordained of god he meant to resist the devil's lie well come on church let's not just leave it on the preacher you was born you was ordained you was anointed you was chosen you was identified by the pillar of fire you was introduced to the supernatural god you was equipped by a supernatural sign you received the supernatural faith to resist what does the word resist mean not give oneself over to to resist to oppose are you hearing me he said we're taught resist the devil how do you resist the devil the same way our chief captain told us to do you take the word of god amen i hope it's okay you can't have life only through christ and now what does his word do it builds up our spiritual body are you hearing me what is the backbone of the supernatural body is those divinely revealed mystery truths that'll be a part of the supernatural and the prophet says right here it builds up our spiritual body strong as we commune with him to resist amen to resist oh come on church to resist amen sometime or another you've got to get a backbone and resist that name of the level of fear resist that devil of unbelief you have been called you've been anointed you have been chosen you have been predestinated by almighty god to resist the devil to resist his life are you hearing me church you ain't got to lay down and believe it you ain't okay you all know jewel forney out here jewelforney says like virgil said like this he said i ain't taking the box of rattlesnakes he can bring it to my door but i've got the power to resist it i don't have to sign for it i don't have to take it in come on church and this message has given you a license amen to challenge every spirit this message has given you a license amen to call everything that a prophet didn't teach error this message has given you an anointing amen to say that's not well i may go out the door tonight but i'm going out the door preaching amen are you hearing me amen listen church this time has come somebody's got to take a stand amen somebody's got to get a backbone somebody's got to stand and say this is truth and this is air and this is godliness and this is un are you hearing me who's going to do it he's not bringing paul back to do it he's not bringing william branham back to do it you are the deciding factors on the earth tonight ain't meant to stand for the supernatural to stand for this message oh god help us tonight god help us amen to take a stand god help us to take courage and stand for this message now let me say it like this you know the bible actually says the time come where there were men who were teaching things right that paul didn't teach and the time come that somebody had a backbone and brother aaron they very politely but very forcefully said that's not what paul taught now watch that same devil did not die when they withstood it then that's the same devil that's come over in this age today that's trying to change this message trying to water down well brother andrew you you got to realize that was brother branham's opinion oh thank you so that tells me he was a vindicated prophet right right vindicated prophet well that's his opinion well you know what that is that's a vindicated opinion what are you talking about all right except there and had a guy tell me one time he said i'll wear shorts all i want to i said well you go right ahead that's your business i said but the prophet taught against it he said well wait a minute that's brother graham's opinion i said exactly right but you know what i'll take his opinion over your thoughts any days are you hearing me see there's got to come a backbone there's going to come a strength there's got to come an authority to the church listen denominations in the condition it's not because there was no courage to make a stand you realize 20 years ago upc's taught it was wrong to have televisions in their home 50 years ago upc preachers was forbidden to have televisions in their home about two years ago a upc preacher told me in kingsport he said this weekend we're going to general conference when i lived in tennessee he said we're going to general conference i said what are you going to conference for he said well we got to have a vote he said we've got to go down there and all the preachers that are licensed with the upc church is coming together and we're going to vote can we have tvs or can we not have them i said why are you going to vote he said well 50 years ago it was wrong but over half of the last and ministers in the upc has got tvs now and it's caused the division and he said we got to go meet and decide if we could have him or not i thought how powerless well let's preach a while we're here how weak amen seek because there was no courage when it was identified wrong there was no courage to stand behind it and say no matter who does it no matter who gets it no matter who says it's okay if it was wrong 50 years ago amen it's still wrong today and let me say this church wow amen this may be my last time here but i'll go out the door preaching there amen if it was sin 20 years ago it's still sin tonight if it was wrong 20 years ago it's still wrong if high heel shoes amen was wrong when the prophet was here they're still wrong tonight amen if makeup was wrong when a prophet was here it's still wrong tonight you say why are you saying this because the time has come somebody has got to take sides somebody has got to make a stand is there anybody here tonight that'll say i hear the devil's lie i hear him telling us that it don't matter no more how we look i hear him telling us it don't matter anymore how we dress and what we say and where we go but i hear god's word saying amen you are separated amen holy people that has been set aside amen to the service of god is there anybody here tonight that'll say devil i'm not backing up i'm not turning around i'm not bowing a knee i'm not bending over to these idols i've been called to resist the devil's lie are you hearing me i'm gonna close with this okay you are anointed to resist the devil's lie you know why i can say that brother with such assurance brother lyle you know i can say that with such authority tonight is because the prophet said when god created me william branham i was before the foundation of the world he made my being my spirit i wasn't conscious of anything as far as i know of but i was there oh i don't believe you're getting it he says but now just a minute jesus told the disciples he knew them before the foundation of the world and paul said there he chose us in him before the world began god chose you he chose me sister before the foundation of the world god chose you brother arny amen before time before adams before molecules before there was one planet god chose you are you hearing me brother aaron before there was one devil amen god chose you before there was one sickness amen god i wish somebody helped me right here amen before there was one thing against you amen god chose you before there was one lie god chose you before there was one error amen god chose you before the foundation of the world and he said now there was some part of me ormond neville and the rest of you all here that's in christ jesus before the world ever begin and here's to my analysis of that how many will take his analysis i think the people today that are possessed with the spirit or the spirit a part of these angelic beings is spirit which rotated off of god that never fail in the beginning and resisted the devil's lie in heaven now do you see the mystery amen now do you see why the devil hates you it's because of your name oh god if your name is on the lamb's book of life amen if your name was put there by the blood of almighty god before there was one devil before there was one sin he knew you and you rotated are you hearing me amen you rotated off of god you rotated out of god you rotated into time and you know why the devil's not nervous or god's not nervous it's because he saw you there resist the devils lie down here and if you resist to the devils lie down here you would have resisted that are you hearing me church no matter what he says no matter what glory tries to come in no matter what trick he tries to play there is a bride on the earth today who has taken sides with thus saith the lord and the supernatural and she's resisted amen somebody shout resisted she has resisted the devil's lie and she stands with god's truth won't you stand your feet with us tonight she's resisted the devil's lie she's resisted the devil's hair she's resisted the devil's tail she believes god she has chosen god beyond just serving him in sincerity she's serving him in truth oh mercy when i get thinking about that i want to put shout and shoes on resist to the devil's lie rotate it off of god right into laodicea devil's talking more he's ever talked before still lying he's a father of lies telling people this message ain't the truth and they're believing him telling people god don't heal no more and they're believing him telling people god don't say no more they're believing him telling people we can't have joy in church and shout no more and they're believing him telling people we can't call the prophet even because we get a little fanatical and they're believing him but you know what i heard over in revelation 13 there's a group there's a group whose name was put in the lamb's book of life and my bible says every knee bowed to the beast and to his mark and to the image except those whose names was on the lamb's book of life from before the foundation of the world can i tell you the rest of the story can i tell you the rest of it and you know what else he said in revelation 15 i saw them i saw them on the other side he meant with her foot on the devil's head brother how quick can you give me revelation 15 verse 1 he saw you on the other side i don't know why this come to me but i'm going to preach it and i saw another sign in heaven great and marvelous seven angels having the seven last plagues for in them is filled up the wrath of god verse two and i saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and them and them that had gotten the victory over the beast over his image over his mark over the number of his name stand on the sea of glass having the harps of god verse three and they sing the song of moses oh are you hearing me they sung the song of moses the servant of god amen the song of the lamb saying great and marvelous are that works lord god almighty just and true are thy ways thou king of saints can we get the last verse there verse 4 who shall not fear thee o lord and glorify thy name for thou only art holy for all nations shall come and worship before thee for thy judgments are made manifest are you hearing me church amen the same prophets that said i saw you rotate off of god into this age it's the same prophet that preached victory day and said i saw you with your vehicle with victory over the beast over the mark of his name over the number of his name come on church you're not going to get to victory you already got to victory you're not going to be victorious you're already victorious tonight you resisted amen the devil's lie and victory has come in the church by the spirit of truth oh glory to god are y'all hearing me tonight do you realize where that song is moses was sung last you realize where that song was sung the last time the song of moses was sung was when they crossed the red sea and miriam picked up a tambourine on the other side of the floor on the other side of the red sea miriam picked up a tambourine amen you can't hardly find the tambourine in the church anymore but thank god i found one right here miriam picked up a tambourine and she began to shout she began to rejoice why was she dancing because she was going to get to victory no sir she already had the victory why was she playing that tambourine because she was going to see her enemies dead she saw him dead come on church when you see your enemy dead when you see amen your name of the lamb's book of life when you hear the word call your name it's worship time oh mercy it's worship time you resisted the devil's lie the devil hates you the devil hates you because he's got men with more degrees and thermometers to believe his lie and take sides with him against us saith the lord but here's a simple humble ordained gene seed people of god peculiar of a royal priesthood don't have big names big popularities big followings big bank accounts we have done that but we've got enough power to resist his life i better quit i'll preach all night are you hearing me church the devil's mad he said belander how in the world can you preach the message of the hour how in the world can uh oh well i'm here might as well say it how in the world can you preach that third pull and the and the rejoice and the power of god and the seventh seal being open and all the mysteries how can you preach that and still have a dance and have a shout and have a worship and have a praise because my prophet said amen when the word come open he says now has come time for king lamb worship now it's time to worship you know what time it is sir sir what time is it it's time to worship it's time for the young people to worship it's time for the elders to worship it's time for the preachers to worship it's time for the deacons to worship it's time for the sisters to worship it's time for the elders to are you hear me it's the elders in heaven are worshiping the angels are worshiping why because they saw something they're wearing a feast y'all know y'all remember general custard right remember jen remember what he done the brother tells his greatest believer fault he said they told him don't go among the sioux said it's a sacred time it's a time of worship they're in a time of feast remember that they warned him said don't go in there said you'll regret it remember said he went on got drunk got his troop and said they went in there said it was a dangerous mistake and you know what we know that asked today custard's last stand you know why because it was a dangerous time do you know why the devil fights worship in the house of god so bad you know why the devil hates a spirit of worship in a church it makes a dangerous church they was in a feast do you realize what we're in tonight we are in a feast a seven course feast all the seals are revealed the table is spread the word is on the table the unfailing body word of the son of man it's being fed upon by the eagles by the by the believers it's a time of feast i say this i feel sorry for the devil that would come amongst the message church when they're in a time of feast it'll be his last stand because you get a people worshiping god they're dangerous you know why because they've been able to get past everything that's against them and still give god praise they've been able to get past lies and unmistrues and sicknesses and family troubles and church splits and church division they've been able to get past all that and still just let go and worship god it's a dangerous time for the devil when the church gets into worship but it's a glorious time for the church you love him tonight amen god bless you this evening friends i trust something was said to bless you do you see who you are tonight do you see

understanding give them the strength to just raise up and say satan i oppose you in the name of jesus christ i refuse i refuse i refuse to give myself over to what god saw me resisting and that is your lie satan and i take the promise of god's word thus saith the lord i am healed thus saith the lord i am sealed but saith the lord i am delivered but saith the lord i am redeemed thus saith the lord i am predestinated thus saith the lord i am ordained for glory oh father you say the people may think how can better understand there and say that he's not a prophet to save saith the lord but
