[18:12] going through a hard time and we it
[18:13] touches us and we say Lord have mercy on
[18:16] them he can be touched by that feeling
[18:22] and also a praise
[18:24] [Music]
[18:30] I want to give the Lord praise for being
[18:33] with my great-grandson during his
[18:35] surgery last week
[18:37] to secure the air ways
[18:41] so he can get off of the ventilator or

[19:06] our sister hopes says I want to thank
[19:11] the
[19:12] uh
[19:15] let me read this this is a cursive
[19:17] writing so it's a little more difficult
[19:19] to read

[19:46] I was thinking today on some of the
[19:48] things as brother Daniel was ministering
[19:50] this this morning
[19:53] and and um
[19:55] sometimes as a father
[19:57] as a friend is maybe you have to come

[20:03] straight
[20:05] out like it is but it's good for us
[20:08] if we'll stop for a moment just look
[20:10] ourselves Lord how am I with you
[20:13] is all well
[20:15] and I just
[20:17] but it also made me think of the love of
[20:19] God
[20:20] because if he didn't care I didn't love
[20:23] you
[20:23] he would say whatever
[20:26] but no he cares and he desires he wants
[20:29] that Fellowship he wants to draw you
[20:30] close to him
[20:32] so let's look at the love of God
[20:35] how rich and pure how measureless and

[36:24] book's a lot deeper than anything that
[36:26] you're going to learn in school it's a
[36:28] good book
[36:29] we're teaching on the book of Acts
[36:30] tonight
[36:31] book of Acts was written by a famous man
[36:36] named Luke Luke was a doctor he was a he
[36:41] was with a doctor or a physician we call
[36:43] him and he was a good friend of the
[36:46] Apostle Paul who was the main character
[36:48] now in the book of Acts
[36:50] Luke basically wrote down he interviewed
[36:54] a lot of people and he did his research
[36:56] and he wrote a lot of this stuff down
[36:59] that that
[37:00] came from his gospel that he wrote about
[37:03] Jesus and then he got to travel
[37:06] and got to be friends with this man the
[37:09] Apostle Paul that I'm going to be
[37:10] talking about tonight
[37:12] and this what we're going to hear
[37:14] tonight is the Apostle Paul it's his
[37:18] first recorded sermon
[37:21] and I know it's been a blessing to me as
[37:23] I've been reading it and learning it and
[37:27] now I hope that I can take a little bit
[37:28] of blessings that I've got and then I
[37:31] could bring him to you
[37:33] let's start right let's get right into
[37:35] it the book of Acts
[37:37] chapter 13 we'll start with verse 15. we
[37:40] we did 1 through 14. on Wednesday
[37:45] so we'll get right into it acts chapter
[37:48] 13 verse 15.
[38:03] and after the reading of the law and of
[38:05] the prophets
[38:06] the rulers of the synagogue sent unto
[38:09] them saying amen and Brethren if ye have
[38:12] any word of exhortation for the people
[38:14] say on so so the setting here is is the
[38:17] the brothers are in church
[38:19] and they they read
[38:22] the the Bible
[38:24] and then they saw that they have some
[38:27] visitors among them and they which
[38:30] Brothers I didn't recognize you Brothers
[38:31] either I saw you come in what what are
[38:34] your names God bless you
[38:37] brother brother Pierre
[38:40] brother Elias where are you from oh
[38:43] there you go what's your name brother
[38:44] Warren God bless you where are you from
[38:47] Phoenix Phoenix
[38:50] all of you for the pier I think I've met
[38:53] you before have I met you before God God
[38:55] bless you all welcome welcome to the
[38:57] Tabernacle tonight we've been in a
[39:00] series on the book of Acts
[39:02] so let's uh so so what happened is like
[39:06] they would have
[39:07] get a guest Minister and they would they
[39:10] would say okay brother do you have
[39:12] anything that you would like to say to
[39:13] the people
[39:15] so they called up Paul here
[39:18] and Paul stood up and beckoning them
[39:20] with his hand he said men of Israel
[39:25] and ye that fear God give audience
[39:28] the God of this people
[39:30] of Israel chose our fathers and exalted
[39:33] the people when they dwelt as strangers
[39:35] in the land of Egypt and with a high arm
[39:37] brought he out of brought he them out of
[39:40] it
[39:40] and about the time of 40 years
[39:43] suffered he Their Manners in the
[39:45] wilderness now he's talking about when
[39:47] the children of Israel came out
[39:50] of Egypt and they wandered in the desert
[39:54] for 40 years we all know the story right
[39:55] do you know you know what the children
[39:57] of Israel are right
[39:59] the children of Israel I'll give a
[40:01] little explanation you have Abraham
[40:04] Isaac and Jacob
[40:07] so Abraham was kind of the father of the
[40:09] faith he came God spoke to him and
[40:11] brought him out of the land and
[40:13] separated him and made him a promise
[40:14] that that his his descendants would be
[40:17] like the stars of the sky
[40:19] and he made a promise of a Promised Land
[40:23] so Abraham his son Isaac and then his
[40:27] son was named Jacob
[40:30] now Jacob had 12 sons
[40:33] and those we call the Patriarchs those
[40:35] are the 12 tribes of Israel now what
[40:38] happened was Jacob
[40:41] he wrestled with the Lord one night
[40:44] all night long and he he wanted the Lord
[40:46] to give him a blessing and
[40:49] towards the breaking of the day
[40:52] he was sometimes we say wrestle with the
[40:54] Lord he wrestled with an angel towards
[40:56] the breaking of the day this Angel tells
[40:58] me says let me go because the sun's
[41:00] coming up
[41:01] and Jacob said I'm not going to let you
[41:03] go until you bless me so then this Angel
[41:06] says okay I'm going to change your name
[41:09] from Jacob
[41:10] to Israel
[41:12] so that
[41:14] is where we have the sons the children
[41:17] of Israel they're the children of Jacob
[41:20] they're the 12 tribes just a little
[41:23] explanation for some that might not know
[41:24] that
[41:27] and when he had destroyed Seven Nations
[41:29] in the land of Canaan he divided their
[41:32] land to them by lot
[41:34] and after that he gave unto them judges
[41:37] about the space of 450 years until
[41:41] Samuel the prophet
[41:43] and afterwards they desired a king and
[41:47] God gave unto them Saul the son of Kish
[41:49] a man of the tribe of Benjamin by the
[41:51] space of 40 years so there we have the
[41:54] very first king of Israel
[41:57] Saul so Saul was King for 40 years
[42:01] do you know how long David was King for
[42:05] 40 years and then how long was Solomon
[42:07] came for
[42:08] 40 years
[42:11] so he says here that that Saul was King
[42:13] for 40 years and when he had removed him
[42:16] he raised up unto them David to be their
[42:18] King to whom also he gave their
[42:21] testimony and said I have found David
[42:23] the son of Jesse a man after mine own
[42:27] heart which shall fulfill all my will
[42:31] now remember Paul's preaching this
[42:35] and of this man's seed hath God
[42:38] according to his promise raised unto
[42:41] Israel a savior Jesus now what happened
[42:45] is Paul started here in the Book of
[42:48] Revelation when he was taught on Book of
[42:50] Genesis when he was talking about the
[42:53] children of is talking about Abraham
[42:55] Isaac and Jacob
[42:56] he's starting out way out there in
[42:59] Genesis and he brings it through David
[43:01] and it's very fitting because David we
[43:05] see that Jesus is called the son of
[43:07] David which means that his lineage
[43:12] was traced back to David as was
[43:15] prophesied from the tribe of Judah
[43:19] and Paul here he's showing us how
[43:23] important
[43:24] it is as he's preaching he's preaching
[43:27] to these these ministers really in this
[43:29] synagogue and he's showing how important
[43:31] it is for us to know our Bible
[43:33] so Paul here he's just quoted off the
[43:35] top of his head
[43:37] and he's he's giving this sermon and
[43:39] he's he's taking this all the way back
[43:42] and he's going through Saul and then
[43:44] through David
[43:46] and he's coming to modern day and it
[43:49] shows how important it is
[43:52] that we know our Bible
[43:55] there's doc there's many doctrines in
[43:57] the Bible that
[43:59] they're important to a Bible scholar now
[44:03] you see that many times in the book of
[44:05] Acts you see that that they do a miracle
[44:08] like um earlier that they smote this man
[44:12] blind and people and the governor saw
[44:15] that they blinded this sorcerer
[44:18] that Paul blinded the sorcerer so he
[44:21] said oh this must be true because there
[44:23] was a miracle done right here so God
[44:26] must be God must be with him so Paul
[44:29] showed a miracle and then Paul here now
[44:32] is exhorting on the scriptures so some
[44:36] people come
[44:38] through
[44:39] understanding the word
[44:42] other people come through the
[44:44] supernatural God gives us always a
[44:48] different way to come to the Lord
[44:50] I was
[44:52] um along these lines when I was in
[44:54] Jeffersonville
[44:55] when I was in the ministry there someone
[44:58] called and he had gotten a track
[45:01] on what was called The Serpent's Seed
[45:04] we all know what the Serpent's Seed is
[45:06] and he uh he read it
[45:10] and um there's a phone number on the
[45:12] back so he called the call came to me
[45:15] and he said my name is so and so I can't
[45:18] remember his name he was a professor
[45:21] at one of the um
[45:24] one of the seminaries that was in Mobile
[45:26] Alabama
[45:28] and he was he was sitting there eating
[45:30] in a barbecue restaurant
[45:33] and
[45:34] he had the little symbol of a seminary
[45:37] on his shirt
[45:38] so this brother comes up to him and he
[45:41] gives him a track
[45:43] and he says Hey read this
[45:46] so the guy being of course very
[45:49] intelligent he he reads it and it's on
[45:51] the serpent seed
[45:53] so he calls up
[45:56] and he says yeah he says so I read this
[46:01] and
[46:03] he says it I don't see how it jives with
[46:07] the word
[46:08] and um he said he said so are you saying
[46:12] that when Eve said I have gotten a man
[46:15] from the Lord
[46:17] he said are you saying um that uh
[46:21] that that was the serpent
[46:24] and I said when Cain was born I said no
[46:26] not at all
[46:28] and sometimes you know when if you are
[46:31] studied up and you're ready the Lord
[46:32] just gives you the right thing to say
[46:34] so I said no I said well
[46:37] I said are you saying that Adam was the
[46:39] Lord
[46:41] and he said ah
[46:44] no
[46:46] I said because if this man came from
[46:49] from the Lord then he was an Immaculate
[46:51] Conception that and and I'm saying that
[46:54] the serpent was his father you're saying
[46:56] that Adam was his father I said that
[46:59] doesn't apply to either one if you're
[47:01] saying it came from the Lord that would
[47:02] be like Jesus he said oh no he said he
[47:05] says no I'm not saying that and he he uh
[47:07] said a couple other scriptures and and I
[47:09] just liked the guy because he was he was
[47:12] legitimately wanting this conversation
[47:14] so I said you know what I said let's
[47:17] turn to Genesis chapter three why don't
[47:19] we do it right now
[47:22] and I said let's just read it and
[47:25] sometimes the word itself just reading
[47:29] it will answer a question
[47:32] so Genesis chapter 3
[47:34] let's start with verse 14. so this is
[47:38] after the fall they had eaten The
[47:40] Forbidden fruits and they were they came
[47:43] before the Lord the Lord said why are
[47:45] you wearing fig leaves who told you you
[47:47] were naked they understood why they had
[47:50] to cover up now after they had done that
[47:53] act and now they were standing before
[47:55] the Lord they were embarrassed because
[47:57] they were they looked the same as they
[47:59] did the day before
[48:01] but now they understood a little bit
[48:03] more than they should have understood
[48:05] so they came before the Lord
[48:07] now listen to this and this is what I
[48:10] read to this Seminary guy and the Lord
[48:13] God said unto the serpent because thou
[48:16] has done this Thou Art cursed above all
[48:18] the cattle and above every beast of the
[48:20] field upon thy belly shalt thou go and
[48:23] the and dust shalt thou eat all the days
[48:26] of thy life
[48:27] no controversy there
[48:30] and I will put enmity
[48:32] which is hatred
[48:34] separation fighting
[48:37] between me and the woman
[48:39] and between thy seed and her seed
[48:42] and I said brother we know what that is
[48:44] we know what a seed is and he says yeah
[48:45] he says I see where you're going with
[48:48] that
[48:49] and it shall bruise thy head and thou
[48:51] shalt bruise his heel and I asked him I
[48:53] said what is that talking about he said
[48:54] he's talking about the Christ
[48:58] I said let's keep going and unto the
[49:00] woman he said
[49:03] God's speaking now to Eve
[49:06] I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
[49:08] thy conception
[49:11] I said what does that mean he had a he
[49:13] had an I assume he had it on his phone
[49:15] he was on the other Lonnie looked at it
[49:16] he said it means childbirth he said
[49:19] every other translation says says
[49:21] childbirth I said right
[49:24] so he's saying I will greatly multiply
[49:26] thy sorrow and thy conception
[49:30] I said he's telling her you're pregnant
[49:34] and he said wow
[49:37] I never looked at it like that
[49:41] and thou shalt bring forth children
[49:45] I said two
[49:48] Cain and Abel
[49:50] and he says huh
[49:53] and I desire to be shall be to thy
[49:55] husband and he shall rule over Thee I
[49:57] said brother this is all about
[49:59] childbirth and conception and all of
[50:02] that he says wow he says I never thought
[50:05] of it like that
[50:07] and he says um I need some more
[50:09] information on that
[50:10] so I don't know whatever happened to him
[50:12] but I I sent him everything that I could
[50:15] and uh we had a really nice conversation
[50:18] after that he asked me a lot of
[50:19] questions and we just seem to be on the
[50:21] same page but he needed the intellectual
[50:25] understanding and someone else
[50:29] like this Governor that we we hear about
[50:31] earlier in the book of Acts chapter 13.
[50:35] he needed the miracle
[50:38] so let's go back to the book of Acts 13
[50:41] 24.
[50:45] when John had first preached before his
[50:48] coming the baptism of repentance to all
[50:50] the people of Israel
[50:53] I'm sorry when John had first preached
[50:55] before his coming the baptism of
[50:58] repentance to all the people of Israel
[51:00] and as John fulfilled his course he said
[51:03] whom think ye that I am I am not he but
[51:06] behold there cometh one after me whose
[51:09] shoes of his feet I am not worthy to
[51:13] loose now Paul puts in this John the
[51:16] Baptist in this explanation of who this
[51:19] Jesus Christ is very very important here
[51:21] because this is only about 10 years
[51:23] after the resurrection
[51:26] so so Paul is saying he's saying well
[51:29] this John the Baptist came and he was
[51:32] introducing this man that he said he's
[51:35] not worthy to untie his shoes now
[51:40] in historical records we see that there
[51:44] were followers of John the Baptist
[51:47] for not just decades
[51:51] after John left and after Jesus rose
[51:55] and not just centuries
[51:57] but thousands of years there are today
[52:02] followers of John the Baptist
[52:04] they're called the the sabians or the
[52:07] the mandians they're in Iraq and in Iran
[52:11] and they follow they still follow the
[52:14] teaching of this man John the Baptist
[52:15] yet they cannot accept Jesus Christ as
[52:20] the virgin-born son of God
[52:22] yet follow John's teaching how strange
[52:26] is that when the whole reason that God
[52:28] placed him on Earth
[52:30] was to preach the gospel was to
[52:33] introduce Christ the greatest man that
[52:35] had ever lived
[52:37] and I've said this before in my opinion
[52:39] the reason he was the greatest man that
[52:40] had ever lived is because he had the
[52:41] first Converse to Christ
[52:44] and we see here that the people ignored
[52:47] much of what John the Baptist was
[52:49] preaching about Christ and they just
[52:51] followed him
[52:53] and it's carried on to this day
[52:56] so Paul says here in verse 26 men and
[52:59] brethren
[53:00] Children of the stock of Abraham and
[53:02] whosoever among you feareth God to you
[53:04] is the word of this salvation scent
[53:08] so right here Paul is giving a little
[53:10] hint
[53:11] to say that we can go outside of our
[53:15] Jewish faith
[53:16] here and when he says here he says and
[53:19] whosoever among you and
[53:22] the stock of Abraham and whosoever among
[53:24] you that feareth God everyone
[53:27] is included and he's throwing out a
[53:29] little hint
[53:31] for they that dwell at Jerusalem and
[53:33] their rulers because they knew him not
[53:36] nor yet the voices of the prophets which
[53:39] are read every Sabbath day they have
[53:42] fulfilled them in condemning him
[53:45] so again Paul is striking these
[53:48] so-called Believers of his day
[53:52] and he's saying he's saying that that
[53:54] you read these scriptures
[53:57] in church
[53:58] you're reading all of these and you
[54:01] think that you're on the right side of
[54:03] History because you're preaching the
[54:05] prophet's message
[54:07] and you're actually the ones
[54:10] that crucified the one that all the
[54:13] prophets were talking about
[54:17] they may associate themselves with a
[54:19] certain Prophet or servant of the Lord
[54:21] but Paul is saying that you are
[54:22] fulfilling the evil
[54:25] that that same Prophet that you claim to
[54:28] believe prophesied would come
[54:31] very strange
[54:36] I mean it
[54:38] whoever that Prophet may be Moses said
[54:40] I'll raise up a prophet like unto me
[54:43] speaking of Christ
[54:46] Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive he
[54:48] said unto us a child is born unto us the
[54:50] son is given he prophesied these things
[54:51] and they're claiming to believe Isaiah
[54:53] and yet they're the ones that killed the
[54:55] one that he was talking about
[54:59] verse number 28.
[55:01] and although they found no cause of
[55:03] death in him
[55:04] yet desired they pilot that he should be
[55:07] slain he's telling them a story of of
[55:09] what happened this 10 years ago
[55:12] and when they had fulfilled all that was
[55:14] written of him they took him down from
[55:15] the tree and laid him in a Sepulcher but
[55:19] God raised him from the dead thank God
[55:22] and here we have the very Foundation of
[55:24] Christianity right here Paul is saying
[55:27] that that yes he died he was given as a
[55:31] sacrifice yet God raised him up from the
[55:34] dead and you know Jesus could not have
[55:37] given us eternal life he couldn't have
[55:39] promised us a resurrection if he
[55:41] couldn't raise from the dead himself
[55:45] and we see
[55:46] and he was seen many days
[55:49] of them which came up came up with him
[55:52] From Galilee to Jerusalem who are his
[55:55] Witnesses unto the people so he's
[55:57] talking about here the disciples he's
[55:59] talking about Peter and James and John
[56:01] and Mary and all these different ones
[56:03] that saw him after he had risen from the
[56:05] dead they saw him dead on the cross they
[56:07] saw him go into the grave and then they
[56:09] saw him as resurrected body they saw him
[56:13] as a resurrected man Jesus Christ and it
[56:16] wasn't just one or two
[56:19] that could have been faked it was many
[56:22] many disciples and Paul is referring
[56:26] back to these ones remember as I said
[56:28] it's only about 10 years
[56:30] after the resurrection
[56:33] and we declare unto you good glad
[56:34] tidings
[56:36] how that the promise which was made
[56:38] under the fathers God hath fulfilled the
[56:41] same unto us their children in that he
[56:44] hath raised up Jesus again as it is also
[56:48] written in the second Psalm Thou Art my
[56:50] son this day have I begotten thee
[56:54] now he's saying that these prophets are
[56:57] your fathers
[56:59] he's saying that that you're the
[57:01] children of these these Prophets
[57:06] and God fulfilled the same unto us their
[57:09] children in that he raised up Jesus
[57:11] again as it is written in the second
[57:13] Psalm Thou Art my son this day have I
[57:16] begotten they begotten thee
[57:20] so he's quoting Assam he's quoting the
[57:22] Old Testament and and right here I want
[57:24] to stop now
[57:26] I'm fairly certain
[57:28] Paul didn't mean this
[57:30] as as he was preaching and he talks
[57:34] about the fathers the the children and
[57:37] the fathers but let me take let me take
[57:40] this opportunity we're teaching it's a
[57:42] Bible study so I I can I can take a left
[57:46] turn I'll take a right turn here in a
[57:48] minute and get back but let me take a
[57:50] left turn and let's go to Malachi
[57:51] chapter four
[57:52] speaking of children and fathers I want
[57:57] to explain a little bit right here
[57:59] Malachi chapter 4 verse 4.
[58:02] it says this
[58:04] now remember this is the Old Testament
[58:06] it's about 400 or so years before John
[58:09] the Baptist came
[58:11] remember ye the law of Moses my servant
[58:13] which I commanded unto him in Horeb for
[58:16] all Israel with the statutes and
[58:18] judgments behold I will send you Elijah
[58:20] the prophet before the coming of the
[58:23] great and Dreadful day of the Lord and
[58:25] he shall turn the heart of the fathers
[58:29] to the children
[58:31] and the Heart of the children to their
[58:33] fathers unless they come and smite the
[58:34] Earth with a curse very familiar
[58:36] scripture to us we all understand that
[58:39] but many times we hear people and they
[58:41] make the mistake of saying Malachi 3 is
[58:43] John the Baptist Malachi 4 is the
[58:46] prophet in our day William Branham
[58:47] that's not entirely true
[58:50] Malachi 4 applies to John the Baptist
[58:55] very much so
[58:58] do you believe me because I'm going to
[58:59] prove it
[59:01] very much so so we look we we see that
[59:06] that Paul here in his epistle or in the
[59:10] book of Acts in his sermon he's saying
[59:12] listen he said he's saying that that
[59:14] your hearts
[59:16] that the hearts of the fathers are are
[59:20] they our hearts need to be turned to
[59:23] them
[59:24] all of the fathers the prophetic fathers
[59:26] have preached this Christ so we need to
[59:29] understand
[59:30] what they're preaching about and this
[59:32] man John the Baptist now this is now
[59:34] this is not in Paul's sermon this man
[59:36] John the Baptist came to introduce
[59:39] this Jesus and turn the heart of the
[59:43] father's
[59:44] to the children
[59:47] where do I get that Luke chapter 1 verse
[59:49] 11.
[59:52] this is right at beginning
[59:55] of uh
[59:57] of the New Testament
[59:59] and there appeared unto him speaking of
[1:00:01] Zacharias
[1:00:03] which is John the Baptist dad
[1:00:05] and there appeared unto him an angel of
[1:00:07] the Lord standing on the right side of
[1:00:09] the altar of incense and when Zechariah
[1:00:11] saw him he was troubled troubled and
[1:00:14] fear fell upon him
[1:00:16] but the angel said unto him fear not
[1:00:18] Zacharias for thy prayer is heard and
[1:00:21] thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee his
[1:00:23] son and shall call his name John
[1:00:27] and thou shalt have joy and gladness and
[1:00:30] many shall rejoice at his birth
[1:00:32] this is the Angel speaking
[1:00:35] for he shall be great in the sight of
[1:00:37] the Lord
[1:00:38] and shall drink neither wine nor strong
[1:00:40] drink remember he's speaking of John the
[1:00:41] Baptist
[1:00:44] and he shall be filled with the Holy
[1:00:46] Ghost even from his mother's womb and
[1:00:48] many of the children of Israel shall he
[1:00:50] turn to the Lord their God and he shall
[1:00:53] go before him in the spirit and the
[1:00:56] power of Elias
[1:00:57] remember Elias is just the Greek form of
[1:01:00] the word Elijah
[1:01:03] to turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:01:05] children
[1:01:07] in the disobedient to the wisdom of the
[1:01:09] just to make ready a people prepared for
[1:01:12] the Lord
[1:01:13] wow he said half
[1:01:16] of John the Baptist there's two part or
[1:01:18] half of Malachi 4 turn the hearts of the
[1:01:21] fathers to the children in the heart of
[1:01:23] the children to the fathers why did he
[1:01:25] only mention one
[1:01:26] because that was going to be fulfilled
[1:01:29] before the second coming
[1:01:32] let me read so
[1:01:35] let me let me read a quote to you here
[1:01:37] something brother Branham
[1:01:38] said in the the um in exposition of this
[1:01:41] seven Church ages he says this
[1:01:44] there's absolutely no doubt that Elijah
[1:01:47] must return before the coming of Jesus
[1:01:50] he has a specific work to accomplish
[1:01:52] that work is the part of Malachi 4 6
[1:01:55] that says he will turn the hearts of the
[1:01:57] children to the fathers to their fathers
[1:01:59] the reason we know
[1:02:01] this is his specific work to do at that
[1:02:04] time is because he already accomplished
[1:02:07] the part that says he shall turn the
[1:02:09] hearts of the fathers to the children
[1:02:10] when Allah when the Elijah Ministry was
[1:02:13] here in John the Baptist Luke 1 17 which
[1:02:16] which I just read
[1:02:18] so we know hear that this is a two-fold
[1:02:23] purpose in this Malachi chapter 4. so
[1:02:27] let's get back as an aside now I'll take
[1:02:30] my right turn sister Shirley I'll get
[1:02:31] back on track with the sermon that Paul
[1:02:35] is preaching in the in the book of Acts
[1:02:36] chapter 13.
[1:02:38] verse number 34.
[1:02:40] and as concerning that he raised him up
[1:02:42] from the dead of course speaking of
[1:02:43] Jesus now no more to return to
[1:02:46] corruption he saith on this wise I will
[1:02:49] give you the sure mercies of David
[1:02:53] verse number 35 says this wherefore he
[1:02:56] saith also in another Psalm Thou shalt
[1:02:59] not suffer thy only one to see
[1:03:01] corruption again I love the way Paul is
[1:03:06] prepared
[1:03:07] for to preach at any time he quotes the
[1:03:12] second psalm
[1:03:14] and then he says
[1:03:16] in another Psalm and I wonder if he just
[1:03:19] I can't remember which Psalm that is but
[1:03:22] I know it's there
[1:03:24] so Paul here he quotes the second and
[1:03:26] then he quotes another another Psalm and
[1:03:29] he's quoting psalm 16.
[1:03:32] and then Psalm 16 says this therefore my
[1:03:35] heart is glad and my glory rejoices for
[1:03:38] my flesh also shall Rest In Hope for
[1:03:41] that will not leave my soul in Hell
[1:03:43] neither will thy suffer thou neither
[1:03:45] without suffer thine Holy One to see
[1:03:47] corruption
[1:03:48] so he's saying here the body of the
[1:03:50] Messiah won't Decay until he's raised
[1:03:53] from the dead
[1:03:56] thou Wilt show me the path of life in
[1:03:59] thy presence is fullness of joy at thy
[1:04:01] right hand and there are Pleasures
[1:04:03] forevermore now Paul
[1:04:06] he was saying this because the tomb of
[1:04:08] David was right there
[1:04:10] and David's body obviously died he
[1:04:13] corrupted and this this Psalm just did
[1:04:16] not apply to David so here is Paul and
[1:04:20] he's pulling this out of the Old
[1:04:22] Testament remember they're Scholars
[1:04:24] there and he's saying here is where that
[1:04:27] applies this very day
[1:04:30] for David
[1:04:34] after he had served his own Generation
[1:04:36] by the will of God fell on sleep and was
[1:04:39] laid unto his father's and saw
[1:04:41] corruption what I just said so David
[1:04:43] died he didn't fulfill that scripture
[1:04:46] he did not rise again
[1:04:48] but he whom God raised again saw no
[1:04:51] corruption oh now he's saying there was
[1:04:54] someone that did fulfill this song
[1:04:57] be it known unto you therefore men and
[1:04:59] Brethren that through this man is
[1:05:02] preached unto you the Forgiveness of
[1:05:04] sins
[1:05:05] and by him all that believe are
[1:05:08] Justified from all things from which ye
[1:05:11] could not be justified by the law of
[1:05:14] Moses what he just said was a mouthful
[1:05:17] so remember who Paul is speaking to
[1:05:20] he's speaking to a bunch of Jews there's
[1:05:23] some Gentiles there too which I'm going
[1:05:25] to get to in a minute but what he's
[1:05:28] saying is
[1:05:30] he's saying that this law
[1:05:32] of Moses
[1:05:34] he says you couldn't be justified you
[1:05:36] couldn't be saved by that
[1:05:38] now he's talking to people that are
[1:05:40] saying well
[1:05:42] they've been raised for literally 1500
[1:05:45] years
[1:05:46] saying that that's the way that they
[1:05:48] will receive salvation
[1:05:50] is by living this law of Moses
[1:05:54] imagine that
[1:05:55] 1500 years
[1:05:58] brother Ronnie of tradition
[1:06:00] 1500 years and here Paul is this little
[1:06:03] little guy he comes up there and he says
[1:06:05] oh by the way now you're wrong
[1:06:08] that's not how you receive salvation by
[1:06:11] the uh by the law
[1:06:15] so his priest probably swallowed their
[1:06:17] sermon about that moment I guarantee
[1:06:20] they didn't like that
[1:06:23] now Paul is saying
[1:06:25] let me read that one again and by him
[1:06:27] all that belief are Justified from All
[1:06:29] Things by Christ
[1:06:31] you're Justified of all things
[1:06:33] from which you could not be justified by
[1:06:35] the law of Moses
[1:06:37] so Paul is saying that you can be
[1:06:39] justified by Christ
[1:06:41] you can be justified by Moses which
[1:06:43] turned everything upside down
[1:06:46] and he's saying here he's saying that
[1:06:47] the law is good
[1:06:49] because it shows you what sin is
[1:06:52] but the law cannot deliver you from
[1:06:56] those sins
[1:06:57] that is key
[1:07:00] that's key to the whole thing
[1:07:03] Paul is saying here that that yeah this
[1:07:05] law of Moses that you think you have
[1:07:06] salvation in you think you could there's
[1:07:08] an afterlife you think that you can have
[1:07:10] these things oh you can't
[1:07:12] that's just showing you what sin is it's
[1:07:15] just showing you how bad you are it's
[1:07:17] showing you what not to do but there is
[1:07:20] a way out and it's from this man
[1:07:23] that was here just 10 years ago
[1:07:28] now the next verse here is calling for
[1:07:30] repentance beware therefore lest that
[1:07:33] you that come upon you which was spoken
[1:07:36] of of the prophets
[1:07:37] behold you despisers now he's quoting
[1:07:40] here a prophet
[1:07:43] beware therefore lest that come upon you
[1:07:45] which is spoken of in the prophets when
[1:07:48] he says in the prophets it's meaning
[1:07:51] these these
[1:07:52] these shorter books
[1:07:54] in here of of the prophets and and uh
[1:07:59] Isaiah and and the different ones
[1:08:03] and he's quoting this he says
[1:08:06] be careful or this is going to represent
[1:08:09] you
[1:08:10] behold ye despisers
[1:08:14] and wonder and perish for I work a work
[1:08:17] in your days a work which ye shall in no
[1:08:22] wise believe though a man declare it
[1:08:25] unto you any idea where he's talking
[1:08:27] from
[1:08:30] one of the most popular books in the
[1:08:32] Bible can you guess
[1:08:35] anybody
[1:08:37] happy cook
[1:08:41] he's quoting from habakkirk
[1:08:44] have a cook one five
[1:08:47] is where he's quoting from so what
[1:08:49] happened in habakkuk chapter 1
[1:08:52] is the prophet was crying out to God
[1:08:54] about the sin that was in Israel and God
[1:08:57] responds and he says I'm going to do a
[1:08:59] work in you that even if you knew what
[1:09:02] it was you wouldn't believe it
[1:09:04] and then God says
[1:09:07] that um you know what let's just read it
[1:09:10] can you find it in your Bibles
[1:09:13] I marked it
[1:09:16] habakook won five
[1:09:18] it says this
[1:09:20] behold ye among ye among the Heathen and
[1:09:23] regard and wonder marvelously for I will
[1:09:26] work a work in your days which ye will
[1:09:29] not believe though it be told to you so
[1:09:33] even if I tell you you're not going to
[1:09:35] believe what's about to happen
[1:09:38] for lo I raise up the Chaldeans that
[1:09:41] bitter and Hasty nation which shall
[1:09:43] March through the breadth of the land to
[1:09:47] possess The Dwelling Places that are not
[1:09:50] theirs
[1:09:51] so what he's saying right here is he's
[1:09:54] saying I'm going to raise up these
[1:09:55] Chaldeans the Babylonians Nebuchadnezzar
[1:09:59] I'm going to raise up these this this
[1:10:01] Evil Nation
[1:10:03] this nation that's even more evil than
[1:10:05] you are by the way
[1:10:07] the most evil nation in really all of
[1:10:09] the world I'm gonna raise them up and
[1:10:12] they're gonna come in and they're going
[1:10:14] to steamroll you guys
[1:10:18] so you can think of the prophet of the
[1:10:21] people like what
[1:10:23] we're bad but they're worse
[1:10:26] but God uses that and he says he says
[1:10:29] I'm going to bring this in and what Paul
[1:10:32] is saying is he's quoting this scripture
[1:10:35] and he's warning them listen this same
[1:10:38] thing could happen to you
[1:10:41] that happened here in have a cook
[1:10:45] the habakkuk prophesied was going to
[1:10:47] happen this same thing could happen to
[1:10:49] you
[1:10:53] I like that
[1:10:55] it's really a nice it was it's it's
[1:11:00] when Paul was is saying that you think
[1:11:03] wow that obscures scripture and Paul
[1:11:07] brings it out of the Old Testament and
[1:11:10] he says by the way he says you know what
[1:11:13] happened here with when the Babylonians
[1:11:15] came in you better be careful because
[1:11:18] that same thing could happen to you
[1:11:21] now when the congregation was broken up
[1:11:23] many of the Jews and religious prophets
[1:11:27] proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas
[1:11:29] who's speaking to them persuaded them to
[1:11:32] continue in the grace of God
[1:11:37] he didn't tell them to continue in the
[1:11:38] law
[1:11:40] he didn't tell them that the law was not
[1:11:42] applicable anymore he didn't say that
[1:11:45] the Old Testament is still the word of
[1:11:47] God but he says continue in the grace of
[1:11:50] God
[1:11:52] Jesus on the cross I preached it this
[1:11:55] morning
[1:11:56] that he said continue in that
[1:12:00] that he died for you and his grace
[1:12:04] upon all of us
[1:12:06] because of his sacrifice
[1:12:09] this cross
[1:12:11] and the next Sabbath day came
[1:12:16] and the next Sabbath day came almost the
[1:12:18] whole city together to hear the word of
[1:12:20] God
[1:12:25] I would love that
[1:12:28] I mean this is it was an amazing sermon
[1:12:30] and it was this this new gospel but the
[1:12:33] next Sabbath day came and almost the
[1:12:35] whole city came to hear the word of God
[1:12:37] wouldn't you love
[1:12:39] to see that Zeal in our day
[1:12:43] oh I would just
[1:12:47] how wonderful would that be
[1:12:50] well we see that
[1:12:52] what had happened
[1:12:54] that day right around that time that
[1:12:57] Paul had
[1:12:58] had smote the the
[1:13:02] um
[1:13:03] that evil soothsayer blind
[1:13:06] and the governor saw it and it was it
[1:13:10] was done openly and then Paul preaches
[1:13:12] this this beautiful sermon basically
[1:13:15] he's saying that the word of all of the
[1:13:19] prophets is true
[1:13:21] and you're interpreting it wrong
[1:13:25] and God fulfilled that in this man that
[1:13:29] went to the cross
[1:13:31] and by the grace of God your sins
[1:13:35] can be forgiven not through the law
[1:13:38] but through the blood of Christ
[1:13:42] but when the Jews saw it
[1:13:45] the multitudes
[1:13:46] here comes the human nature
[1:13:49] but when the Jews saw the multitude they
[1:13:52] were filled with envy and spake against
[1:13:54] those things which were spoken by Paul
[1:13:57] contradicting and blaspheming
[1:14:00] so we see these people are jealous
[1:14:02] because they were having big meetings
[1:14:04] and they were so there was so much
[1:14:05] excitement and so much Zeal and when God
[1:14:08] raises up a work when he starts doing a
[1:14:11] work Paul said when I would do good evil
[1:14:14] as present with me
[1:14:16] and here it is right here
[1:14:19] they tried to tear it down
[1:14:24] how many times
[1:14:25] when we want to do something good
[1:14:28] how many times do with the does the
[1:14:31] devil just fight us tooth and nail
[1:14:34] it could be it could be having a meeting
[1:14:37] it could be something that would be a
[1:14:40] blessing to the people or it could be
[1:14:42] it could be a job or it could be
[1:14:45] whatever in our life that we feel that
[1:14:48] God is leading and then we hit a barrier
[1:14:52] we hit a setback and so often people
[1:14:55] just say Well it must not have been the
[1:14:57] Lord
[1:14:59] What if Paul would have said that
[1:15:01] right here
[1:15:02] right at this very point when everybody
[1:15:04] was raised up against him and he started
[1:15:07] started feeling all of these problems
[1:15:10] What if Paul would have said must not
[1:15:12] have been God
[1:15:14] maybe we'll go to the next city
[1:15:19] but he didn't do that
[1:15:22] then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold
[1:15:26] and said
[1:15:27] it was necessary that the word of God
[1:15:30] should first have been spoken to you
[1:15:33] but seeing ye put it from you
[1:15:36] and judge yourselves Unworthy of
[1:15:39] everlasting life
[1:15:41] wow
[1:15:43] you talk about waxing bold that's bold
[1:15:46] and he's saying all of you that I just
[1:15:49] preached this sermon to Paul speaking
[1:15:51] that I just preached this sermon to I
[1:15:54] brought you from Genesis all the way to
[1:15:57] this day all the way to the Forerunner
[1:15:59] of Christ I showed you that there is no
[1:16:02] salvation in this law that there is
[1:16:04] salvation in this man Jesus and you have
[1:16:07] made the choice that you don't want it
[1:16:10] you want your traditions
[1:16:13] you've judged yourself Unworthy of
[1:16:16] everlasting life low we turn to the
[1:16:19] Gentiles
[1:16:21] and here we see a definitive change
[1:16:23] brother while
[1:16:25] we see that Paul now he has he was
[1:16:29] preaching they've been preaching to the
[1:16:30] Jews and Peter and Philip and Stephen
[1:16:32] and all of these ones have been
[1:16:34] preaching to the Jews and Paul says here
[1:16:36] he says
[1:16:38] Lo we turn to the Gentiles now
[1:16:42] for so hath the Lord commanded us
[1:16:45] saying I have set thee to be a light of
[1:16:48] the Gentiles that thou shouldest be for
[1:16:51] salvation unto the ends of the Earth
[1:16:53] Paul was commissioned by none other than
[1:16:54] Jesus Christ himself
[1:16:57] to be a light to these Gentiles to bring
[1:16:59] this gospel to the Gentiles and now Paul
[1:17:04] is seeing here we go
[1:17:08] they've put us out
[1:17:10] now I'm going to fulfill this which God
[1:17:14] commissioned me to do on the road to
[1:17:15] Damascus
[1:17:19] so we have these
[1:17:21] hard Stony hearted people
[1:17:26] and they're saying they're doing
[1:17:28] everything they can to hinder this
[1:17:29] they're seeing these big meetings they
[1:17:31] don't like it they want to they want to
[1:17:33] put a stumbling block in it
[1:17:35] but
[1:17:37] here's the smile that you can put on
[1:17:39] your face
[1:17:41] and when the Gentiles heard this they
[1:17:43] were glad
[1:17:45] I'm a gentile
[1:17:46] you know I was like I come I come that
[1:17:51] that these people they accepted the Lord
[1:17:54] and when the Gentiles heard this they
[1:17:55] were glad and glorified the word of the
[1:17:57] Lord and as many as were ordained
[1:18:00] to eternal life believed praise God
[1:18:04] so the Gentiles were happy and yeah I
[1:18:06] bet they were happy this man Paul what
[1:18:09] what a man he was and they they were
[1:18:11] they were watching him preach and he
[1:18:13] just had such command to the scriptures
[1:18:15] he was so encouraging and he said you
[1:18:19] can be forgiven of your sins
[1:18:22] and not only did he just preach it but
[1:18:24] he showed it with signs and wonders
[1:18:28] and the word of the Lord was published
[1:18:31] throughout the region
[1:18:34] but the Jews stirred up now here we go
[1:18:36] again
[1:18:37] the problems but the Jews stirred up The
[1:18:40] Devout and honorable women the word
[1:18:43] honorable means prominent
[1:18:46] women and the chief men of the city and
[1:18:48] raised persecution against Paul and
[1:18:51] Barnabas and expelled them out of their
[1:18:53] coasts
[1:18:55] but they shook off the dust of their
[1:18:57] feet against them and came to Iconium
[1:19:00] now to shake off the dust of your feet
[1:19:04] it was a Jewish expression of really of
[1:19:08] breaking Fellowship
[1:19:10] it was it was saying that you if you go
[1:19:13] back um
[1:19:14] Jesus I think he was
[1:19:17] forgot exactly where it was when he sent
[1:19:19] out the 70
[1:19:21] and he sent them to preach the gospel
[1:19:23] and he says if you're not accepted and
[1:19:25] he sent out to 12 too and he says if
[1:19:27] you're not accepted he said Shake the
[1:19:29] Dust
[1:19:30] from your garments Shake It Off off of
[1:19:32] your feet
[1:19:34] and that was this that Jewish tradition
[1:19:36] of separating
[1:19:38] they turned it down we're done
[1:19:44] now he says they shook off the dust of
[1:19:47] their feet against them and they came to
[1:19:49] Iconium
[1:19:51] and we'll wrap it up here the musicians
[1:19:54] can come
[1:19:56] so Iconium
[1:19:59] brother Lyle was in the land
[1:20:01] of galatia
[1:20:03] and this next chapter that we hear if
[1:20:08] the Lord's willing and if he tarries
[1:20:10] until Wednesday
[1:20:12] brother Lyle will bring out this Acts
[1:20:15] chapter 14 and we're going to see these
[1:20:18] Brethren we're going to see the
[1:20:19] persecution really hit him
[1:20:22] we're going to see them going through
[1:20:23] this land of galatia from town to town
[1:20:27] traveling through Barnabas and and Paul
[1:20:30] and we're going to see how mean these
[1:20:32] people really get
[1:20:34] and they got mean they did everything
[1:20:36] that they could to hinder
[1:20:40] in this last verse verse 52.
[1:20:44] in closing it says this
[1:20:46] and the disciples were filled with joy
[1:20:49] and with the Holy Ghost
[1:20:54] I love the way it's it it's ended now as
[1:20:57] I've said before that the Bible
[1:21:01] in this book of Acts when it was written
[1:21:03] it wasn't written with chapters in it it
[1:21:06] was just written as one big long letter
[1:21:09] and the um
[1:21:13] fairly not too long ago
[1:21:16] they came in and they put the chapters
[1:21:18] in so that we could look it up
[1:21:21] but I like the way the place that they
[1:21:23] stopped this one
[1:21:26] and the disciples were filled with joy
[1:21:29] and with the Holy Ghost
[1:21:32] and I think
[1:21:34] how happy they must have been to see
[1:21:38] number one that God was with them
[1:21:41] we see that God protected them we'll see
[1:21:43] at lystra coming up in Acts chapter 4
[1:21:46] that God God allows them by the way to
[1:21:49] suffer
[1:21:51] but he protects them he keeps them alive
[1:21:55] so that they can go and then they can
[1:21:57] preach elsewhere
[1:21:59] and it's beautiful that they're filled
[1:22:01] with joy and filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:22:04] amen
[1:22:06] do you like the book of Acts
[1:22:08] chapter 13 I love that sermon that Paul
[1:22:11] preached he started way back as I said
[1:22:15] in Genesis comes all the way through
[1:22:16] through um through the Patriarchs and
[1:22:19] through through the Wilderness comes to
[1:22:21] David shows that that David his lineage
[1:22:26] he's probably laying a foundation maybe
[1:22:28] for them at a later time but shows that
[1:22:32] David came and David prophesied that
[1:22:35] this man would come
[1:22:36] he came
[1:22:38] [Music]
[1:22:39] and
[1:22:42] you can see why everybody was so upset
[1:22:46] it's like by the way this legalism
[1:22:50] stuff
[1:22:51] it's good
[1:22:53] all of this this Old Testament it's all
[1:22:57] the truth
[1:22:59] but it was pointing to a place that you
[1:23:02] didn't go
[1:23:03] you took God's word
[1:23:07] and you took it to a place that God
[1:23:09] didn't want it to go
[1:23:12] but here
[1:23:14] in this man Christ Jesus
[1:23:17] is where that all the prophets pointed
[1:23:20] to where all the prophets spoke of is
[1:23:23] this man and in him
[1:23:26] and not in the law
[1:23:28] in him you have Redemption you have
[1:23:31] remission of your sins you have
[1:23:33] justification
[1:23:35] in him and him alone
[1:23:37] Christ only
[1:23:39] God bless you all let's let's stand
[1:23:41] brother I forgot your name there on the
[1:23:43] left
