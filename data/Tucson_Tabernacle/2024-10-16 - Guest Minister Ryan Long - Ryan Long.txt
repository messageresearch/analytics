little bit of rest right it's not a it's not a rest from from fighting where we got to go back to fighting it's a rest it's a true rest and I I really believe that when you when you find your place in the Lord you find a place of rest it doesn't mean it's not hard right it doesn't mean it's not a battle but I rest in his ability to win that battle amen and that's there's but I believe this song's talking about a rest that I don't know if we've experienced yet we were talking about that brother that maybe going on he's about to experience some real rest real rest got to lay down the weapons don't have to pick them up no more I look forward to that but we're here and we got a battle how many's how many still fighting how many is tired of fighting I'll raise my hand but we got the Lord on our side amen and right when I right when I fail right when I drop the sword he picks it up amen he picks it up he picks me up and he carries me forward it's not a it's not a cliche it's not a metaphor for it's not a nice thing it's the truth yes it's what the Lord does for us he goes ahead and fights our battle for us we just need to we just need a claim it this morning amen I just appreciate the the song service appreciate the worship and I can't sing but I certainly like singing with the musicians here we appreciate them we appreciate brother Dan as always for just his friendship and his um his kindness and his invitation to to stand behind the pulpit that is um he has responsibility over and we don't take that lightly we always want to fall into the channel That the the pastor is in the spirit that the pastor is in so that it's a blessing to the people amen you don't want to come in and say something that that would go against anything but we want to just say what God has to say amen and so I just always want to uh to look at it that way and to to Really Just Surrender I pray that you would surrender too yourself to the Lord this morning um you know it doesn't do much good for a speaker to surrender if the ears aren't surrendered to wow you know a a speaker could be surrendered and and and Words of Life could flow forth not from me but from the Lord and if your ears aren't surrendered and your hearts are not surrendered um it'll be like seed that just fell on Stony ground and I know we get hard and I know we get thorny right but let's just let's just uh let's do a little plowing this morning even if it's right now in your mind just say Lord I came here with with uh with an argument I came here maybe I got in a little uh you know nobody been married has ever been in argument before maybe you gotten a little uh uh fight on the way to church or maybe you just have a battle going on maybe you just pray to the Lord right now Lord just set that aside I want to hear from you this morning and and I I trust that he will help you do that how many is looking forward to hearing from the Lord this morning amen that's the only thing that's going to do us any good my word's going to fail brother Dan I could say this I know what you you know what I mean your word's going to fail it's going to fail but we we we have the reason why you gather here this morning is because we have a word that does not fail and that's the one we want to hear this morning let's let's read a scripture I kept you standing um a scripture I think it's really familiar but um I'm going to read it anyways if if you would Ephesians 4 11 um a lot of what we believe is based upon the scripture I've heard it quoted uh my whole life and uh I'm not going to bring anything new to it but I'd like the Lord maybe just to open up uh an standing if we could this morning Ephesians 41 when you have it say Amen should be familiar to us he says and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers now just something to point out if he's telling in the scripture that he gave some these things he must be talking to those that He gave it to he's not talking to the apostles he's not speaking to these prophets and these evangelists he's telling you the Church of God that he's given you these things for the perfecting of the Saints for the working of the ministry you know if you want to be in the ministry it's not an easy path it's work the work of the ministry and for the edifying of the body of Christ that word edifying means uh maybe you know this but it means to build it means to actually construct and to build up so the ministry the fivefold ministry as we call it has been given to build or construct God a body for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the building the construction of the body of Christ dropping down to 16 For Whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto same word the construction or the building of of itself in love dropping down to verse 29 he says let know now listen who is he talking to all right he gets a you get A+ A+ he's talking to you and he's talking to me he gave you and I a Ministry can we say Amen to that he gave you and I something that would help build us into a body that he would be pleased with and now he's going to give us more he says now you that I'm talking to he says let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of same word building and constructing that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers amen let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father we just want to approach your word and your throne now Lord not not with any preconceived notion Lord not with any thoughts of our own we just want to open your word have you give us an understanding of it Lord may you just take these these words of a man Lord that are are are fallible and will fail Lord and may you strengthen and turn them into your word Lord may your spirit just come and speak to any Heart Lord that is wanting to hear from you this morning that's pulling that's in expectation Lord I believe that you've bound yourself Lord to meet that expectation and that's what we trust on this morning Lord we ask you just come and talk to us now Lord out of your Bible in Jesus name amen you may be seated uh might be a strange scripture to start with we all kind of know that scripture but uh I I I just like that thought of the of the ministry and really what the purpose of that Ministry was given for is to build a house and uh I'll get on that here in a minute I want to read another scripture it's okay I got I got a few scriptures to read if you don't mind uh I hope it's still okay that we turn in our Bibles and read some scriptures right that hasn't gotten too old uh 2 Corinthians 4: 8 um it's a a couple scriptures here I'll try to go fast um I don't want to take too much time this morning but I want to give all time to the Lord and also be considered of you all here I want set a uh uh set myself a little timer just so I have something to ignore when it goes off rather down so but I could I can say that I tried no I really want to to try to to try to be uh uh graceful with the time you've given me this morning Ephesians second I'm sorry 2 Corinthians 4:8 it says we are troubled it's still talking to us we are troubled on every side oh amen right I can say Amen to that one I feel troubled on every side sometimes yet we are not distressed we are perplexed but we are not in despair persecuted how many fell persecuted all right we got a couple pers persecuted but not forsaken we're cast down on but not destroyed yes sometimes we're cast down by Family sometimes we're cast down by work by our jobs by our own selves amen cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body we're talking about a body being built a body being constructed and we want more than anything I believe that you're on the same page with me we want more than anything to see the life of the Lord Jesus being made manifest in that body there's no point in constructing a home anybody that's in construction there's no point in building a home and putting the nice furnishings and and finishes on it if nobody's going to live in that house right if it's just going to sit there empty what was the point of doing all that work for which for we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh I want to drop down to uh verse 17 it says for our light Affliction We Were cast down we're persecuted we're attacked on every side and yet the Bible says I know that you are but that's light Affliction for is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory and I love this verse it says while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal and the first verse of the next chapter flows right from that it says for we know if our Earth House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens I'm going to read you something I I I I I know it's okay to read a quote I want to start off with this if you don't mind it says more and more I am made to believe that people are not getting to christow you say you start off on a negative well just just wait now I am here to help in every way that I can and make my statement as clear as I know how to make them and you suffer with me if you will as I look and I preach Across the Nation and watch the people I am fully persuaded the prophet of God says that the people are not getting to Christ and I believe that it's the enemy that's throwed this hindrance and the reason I believe this is because he talking about the Lord is not the object that they have been pointed to they have either been pointed to a Dogma or a Doctrine or a party or experience or a sensation or something like that instead of being pointed to Christ the word and I that's why I think that people are resting their Eternal destination upon some Dogma or some sensation like some say I danced in the spirit I spoke with tongues I felt fire run over me and you know that all those things can be impersonated by the devil wow now does it mean those things are wrong no no it doesn't mean they're wrong it means they are something that can be impersonated it doesn't mean that they're not there isn't a genuine out there I think that we're taught by the word that if you see a counterfeit dollar bill are you following me yeah if you see a counterfeit dollar bill that's the best sign that there's a real dollar bill out there right you can't make a counterfeit of something that doesn't exists or something that's not real the best sign that there is a real experience that there is real emotion with God is that there's an impersonation of that emotion but he's trying to get a point across to us that we are not to look at those things as evidence that we are doing the right thing they are a benefit they are a maybe the word is they are a bonus they are a thing that is good when the Lord allows it to happen but it does not mean the Lord is with you if they do happen I know that sounds a little bit backwards but that's exact sometimes we're taught if you're not doing these things you don't have the Lord if you're not dancing you know and I hear both sides of it if you're not dancing in the spirit well the Lord's not in your service and then I hear the other side but but also if you're not being still and listening to the Small Voice well then the Lord's not in your service and I think I I think we're looking at the wrong things sometimes and I really like to talk to you this morning if the Lord permit about a change in perspective a change in our point of view you know sometimes we just have the point of view I have the point of view that I'm attacked at all sides and I forget that I haven't been defeated I just look at the one perspective and I think okay I see that I'm being attacked but I failed to have the perspective that wait a minute I'm still standing wait a minute I haven't been defeated I fell down I got beat I'm on my knees but I'm still alive I I haven't been conquered yet why is that Lord but I'm just concentrating sometimes on the hard thing that's happening to me oh Lord I'm going through a trial and then another trial comes and another trial comes and another trial you know he allows every single one of those trials that not one thing if you're a child of God how many how many is a child of God I just want to make sure okay good that was that was like 99.9% that that's pretty good there's 100 I will say it's 100 that if you're a child of God that not one trial can come upon you that the Lord hasn't said yes I'm going I'm going to let that happen you can touch this but you can't touch this you can affect this part of that sister's life but you can't touch this part that brother who's going through this I'm going to let you let him go through that I'm goingon let you Satan uh have a shot at him but you can't take his life where do we find that we find that in job if you're going through and job just didn't go through one trial he went through it was uh One messenger comes in oh your all your children are dead another messenger comes in all your herds are dead another messenger comes in oh this and then all of a sudden he's sick and then his wife comes it's it was literally trial after trial after trial and sometimes I feel like I'm just in I'm I'm going well it's going good and then there's sometimes it's just like it's it's hit after hit after hit after hit but it's but it's a perspective that God is trying to get me to see he said there's one thing that he cannot impersonate and that's the word he says in a debate between him and Jesus each time Jesus defeated him he said it is written the word and I believe today that the reason people are not coming to Christ is because they are appointed to a denomination come on you say well wait a minute we we're appointed to a denomination we're not in the Lutheran Church we're not in the Catholic church if you're not being pointed to the one who's going to inhabit the house that is being built you're being pointed in the wrong direction I I I want to just say this and I hope you get what I mean but if you're being pointed to the ones who were who were building the house they're not the important ones if I could just say that again there is a Ministry given and the job of the ministry is to build a house anybody ever moved into a house that should be an easy one all right do you know who built it now maybe you built it but if you don't if you didn't build it do you know who who built it have you ever met them would you move into the house anyways yes because who built the house doesn't necessarily matter what matters is that you are moving into that house and I think sometimes so much focus is put on the ministry because they but they are actually just put there to help build a house what really matters what really we need to be poed to is who is going to come inside that house and inhabit it who is going to come and make that house a home is it going to be the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ slain for us or is it going to be the spirit of the Builder who built the house I know that's I know maybe that's a confusing question but I think sometimes according to what I'm reading we're being pointed to the wrong thing we're being pointed to that person or or somebody who may have just been appointed by God to preach one message and that one message maybe just put on the trim around the side of the house that's all they were there for maybe this is a last message I'll ever preach and maybe it was just to like move some dirt up around the house and just smooth it out maybe that's the only purpose I've had but guess what God is using that and other Ministries to build a house what's really important is you because you're the house that is being built you're the house that's being built he cares about the house because that's what he's going to come and live in it's not that he doesn't care about the ministry he doesn't care about Apostles and Prophets of course but they are his workmen to really build the thing that he cares about which is you that's a point of view that God wants to get across to us that maybe you are focused on the one building you and not focused on the one who's going to come and live in you and it's important Ministry is important I'm not diminishing the ministry but really they're the servants that build the house you he say that many times they're pointed to a denomination you come to our church this is his in quotations you come to join our church or you read our catechism or you believe our Doctrine anybody ever hear that in the message yes sir yes they are pointed in the wrong way and their action and the life that they live without Christ proves in their own life is vindicating that very thing the ministry is given to help build the construction of the house that's it not to come and live in the house not to be the lord of the house not to rule over the house to help build the house how do they do that by looking into the word by the way we should be I can I can say this because I'm also a sheep I'm not a pastor I I could say this as a sheep I need to be looking into the same exact word that the pastor's looking into I need to be reading exactly the same Bible that he's reading because how am I supposed to know if what he's feeding me is sheet food if I don't know what sheet food is right now I tell you I've been guilty of eating food served to me that I didn't know what it was and it wasn't the fault of the person feeding me it was my fault because I didn't go look at what I was being fed I just accepted it and said oh well it's coming from the ministry building the house it must be good that's not good enough you have to make sure that the material being used to build you is from God does that make sense preaching the gospel is not just standing behind a Pulpit and preaching the word he says that the gospel did not come to us in word only but in power and demonstrations of the holy spirit so to me it's not just somebody who can who can preach well or speak well it's somebody when you look at their life when they're not standing behind this Pulpit that their life actually preaches louder than the words that they're saying that the manifestation of the Holy Spirit what does that mean in signs and wonders no no the fruit of that spirit is evident in their life that's somebody you can say okay you can come and work on this house because this house can can everybody just say this house this house is a house of God this house needs to be built up to God would be pleased to come and dwell in it and so it's important that you as the house look at what you're being built with and who is building you I hope that I hope that that's okay to put that responsibility on you it is important brother Dan it's it's actually one of the most important things you you can do and and the the beautiful part is that if the ministry is operating properly it's not building the house of God according to their ideas according to their specifications you know I have a a part of my job um this is going to be a little bit boring so you just bear with me part of part of my job is is is a little bit boring it's like I just stare at uh plans blueprints all day it's it's it's that boring that reaction you had is exactly how boring it is it's just you stare at plans all day and it's just 2D images sometimes they're graceful and they give you like a roughly 3D but you just stare at them and I I I hope this analogy makes sense cuz this this is how I think of things you know if I'm reading that plan and and and and there's a there's so much information on that plan that you actually can't fit it all on one page okay so you get even just a simple house let alone a building like this but a simple house might be might be 15 20 pages and if I'm staring at that page and it tells me I'm going somewhere with this it tells me that that a wall belongs right here okay it tells me about this wall and I look at that that wall and it says okay you need to build a wall right there it tells you where it goes and you take off you have the blueprint you've read in your Bible it says resist the devil and he will flee from you you say okay I'm going to go and I'm going to Build That Wall and you go to Build That Wall you immediately are going to have questions if you if you know what you're doing you're going to say well wait a minute um I can't see from a top down view how tall that wall is what if I only build the wall this High what if I build it too high and now it's sticking out into the weather what do you need you have to go and find in the blueprint that information and listen I I know this is a stretch but you cannot do that if you just want to see things from your perspective wow you have to go back into the blueprint and you have to search and first of all to even do this okay to even do this let's put on our spiritual cap we're not we're not building a physical house let's put on our spiritual think cap to even do this you have to first say I don't have all the information and right there gets about 90% of Christians today I don't have all of what I need to do this job instead a lot of Christians and I've been guilty this oh I know it because I've read the Bible and I've listened to the message I know what it is I need to know and I know that this brother or so and so is telling me something else but you know what I really know what the truth is I know what it is I've had something revealed to me and no doubt we've had things revealed but it just so happen happens that someone else might have that other page that you need to look on to see how tall that wall is and God will do that on purpose just to see if you'll go and seek out that information just to go and see if you will be willing to look at something from somebody else's perspective and I think maybe I was speaking here before and I think I did this uh maybe not but I think it's a great uh example if I were to say um Joe well let's see I'm want to pick on somebody who can I pick on Daniel I like that you got volunteered I I I didn't I I didn't plan on saying this you just forgive me but brother Daniel I think I picked on brother Aaron before what is the what's the front of this Pulpit look like it's a cross brother Dan do you see a cross I don't you think brother you I love brother Daniel yeah but he's he's off the word not right he's off the word if if only I could get him the revelation of what I see if only I could get you the Revelation that there isn't a cross on there there's like a door there's a light there's a Bible you don't see any of that uh you just need to come up a little higher brother you just right you just anybody hear that phrase you just need to oh you just need a little bit more Revelation you need to come up a little bit higher you need to come and stand where I'm standing and yet he has a perfectly and so to everybody here a perfectly truthful view of what the front of this Pulpit looks like and yes do I have a view that maybe you don't see but who needs to be willing to say you know what I'm going to go and I'm going to see exactly what it is you're talking about oh there is a cross right there oh you know what the Bible does say that oh you know what when when the prophet of God said this maybe he really did mean this but the the thing is is I haven't walked if I'm not willing to walk a mile in your shoes that right out of the word I better be able to to walk a mile in your shoes and then maybe I'll see where you're coming from cuz maybe you went through something brother Daniel that put you in that position right there where you're sitting where that view of the word now the word isn't just four sides the word is eternal but let's just say this is the word your view of the word was shaped by your experience that put you right in that chair and because I haven't been through that experience this is so simple so I know I I know you can't miss this it's so simple but your experence put you right there and if I'm not willing to see something from another perspective there is no possible way I could know the word of God and then there's no possible way my house can be built properly anybody ever live in a house that's just a 2d wall nobody right nobody if if a Builder turn you over that your your house is complete it's beautiful and you open the door and you just step into the Earth on the other side nobody will accept the house right but somehow I think sometimes we're we're the devil it's really a trick of the devil to to to make us satisfied with one view of the word of God wow one view of the word of God just one vision of it and oh I know the whole thing look at it's it's 20 feet tall how deep is it well don't worry about that right now it's 20 feet tall and it's got windows and it's doors it's a beautiful house but but if you step around just a little bit not you have not even much just a little bit oh there's no side to the house there's no inside there's no roof I couldn't see that from where I'm at I and again this is so simplistic but I think that we I think and I know that we do this sometimes just as individuals and we do it as a church as well because uh generally a church is a collective of people who think the same way and so but as individuals I think we we really limit how much of the word of God we can experience by not taking in somebody else's experience by not taking in a perspective of somebody else and you you you you you go try to Build That Wall and you just how wide is it how tall is it what's on the other side of it is it painted is it dry well what it you don't know because all you have is the information now you can go back to the blueprint and you can check it but but but the Lord is so good he's been taking that same blueprint and he's been showing somebody else that page of the plan now if you want to say well I want to know everything first of all that's not how God works God's going to put you in a if if you won't if I will not willingly I'm just tell you how the Lord works and it's it's it sounds harsh but it's the most beautiful thing he does if I am not willing to go sit where brother Daniel's sitting and see that perspective of the word the Lord will cause or allow a trial to come wow for my benefit that puts me in that position so then I can look up and see exact actly what it is I needed to see you say oh trials are hard yes there's trials and yet we're not dismayed we're in a fight and yet we're not defeated we're in those things because God is saying I want you to look at me in a different light I I I don't care if you've been a Christian for 10 days or 10 years you have not seen all there is of God Amen and and I I I would go to far as to say if we ever ever ever get in the position spiritually in our mind where we think we've seen all of God I would say that's that's about as close to blasphemy as you could get because BL because God is eternal and you can never see every side of him he always if you don't take anything else take this he always has A New Perspective for you to see him in even after he takes you and I go and I he puts me through a trial and I'm sitting where brother Daniel's sitting and I see that guess what there's another side over here there's another side from here there's another side from here and it's an eternal word we're talking about a four-sided Pulpit it's an eternal word of God wow and you can come back to the blueprint we know that but it's really God wanted to show a different perspective you know um the prophet of God I'm I'm going to keep moving I hope I didn't take too long with that but he says there's two places where two different men are speaking of justification let's just take it back to the Bible now if if you if you want to believe what I'm telling you that's good but let's go right to the Bible and we'll find it two different men speaking of justification one of them was Paul one was Peter Peter was justifying Abraham I'm sorry Paul was justifying Abraham by his faith talked about Abraham talked about his faith Peter however was justifying Abraham by his works now you might be in the Paul side of things and this is what the devil wants us to do okay are you for Paul or are you for Peter that's right and you know brother Dan he's not exactly for Paul he's more of a Peter guy but I kind of see Paul so how about I just start another church I'm just going to say the way it is I'm going to start another church and anybody that likes Peter more hey we preach Peter over here we preach Peter now we like Paul but but Peter it's about works and then let me show you all the quotes that I have about works and then I can back up what I'm telling you and pretty soon I have you convinced that my perspective is the right one wow but if we look at the full thing he says Paul said he was justified by faith Peter by works now they did not contradict one another right out of the message they were looking at it from two different viewpoints Paul was speaking of Abraham's Faith that's what God saw in Abraham and Peter was talking about his works now listen we believe in works but yet we also believe that you can't do enough works to be good enough to go it's almost a paradox right we believe in faith and yet the Bible says without works your faith is dead and and and the and the and the word explains it very simply your faith is what God looks at and the works of your faith is what men look at did we catch that because I can tell you brother Josiah all day what my faith is but you're looking at what I do you're looking at what I say you're looking at how I act you're looking at How I Live you're looking at how I speak you're looking at how I treat somebody I disagree with and somebody I don't disagree with you're not listening to me talk about my faith to you you're looking at my life and what I'm doing and God is exactly the opposite you can tell God oh God I prayed to to you oh God I love everybody God I do this and God's looking just at your faith what does your faith produce he's not looking at your works because anything good that you have done he did it what he's he's looking at your faith you can tell God all day what you're going to do but God's looking at your faith and that's such a simple explanation of that but but if you have the mentality if you have a spirit really upon you that does not allow you to see A New Perspective you'll start to pick side es inside of a Bible that we say we all believe in you're not even picking sides between Pharisees and the disciples anymore you're picking sides inside of disciples and pretty soon you'll pick sides with something Jesus said against something else Jesus said somebody will send a scripture to somebody and somebody else will send a scripture back oh well he also said this and all of a sudden we got Bible fighting Bible I don't need to go into quotes cuz we we know that already quotes fighting quotes it's it's a mess what has happened is we're not getting to Christ we're being pointed to denominational thinking which denominational thinking is really simple it's it's it's thinking that divides us that's really the simple breakdown of it and and he says here and Peter was talking about what man saw because man had Faith he'll act like it his life will show it to others I just want to finish that quote off uh Moses needed a new perspective you know Moses had seen God in a burning bush I would like a physical burning bush experience I would love to see a physical burning bush experience but then God comes to him again and it says later on that God spoke to him face to face so he gets one perspective of God and God is you know what Moses there's more to me than that there's more to me than just that I'm going to speak to you face to face and then Moses gets to a point he says Lord I've seen you in the burning bush I've spoke to you face to face but would you just Show Me Your Glory and he gets he and the Lord says I'll put you in the Clift of rock and he walks by and he says at the backside of the man that's not a perspective Moses expected he thought he was going to see something glorious and God gave him a perspective he never would have thought he was going to see but it was God saying I have so much to show you you just need to want to see it oh you say oh I want to see it I want to see it brother Daniel might have that perspective that I have for for you well I don't know if I want to see that anymore Lord show me another view of your word I'm going to put you together with this sister of this brother over here Lord show me a perspective of your word I I was trying to I was putting together with this brother and sister over here Lord show me a new perspective of your word and he's trying to and because of my stubbornness because of my uh my thinking that I know everything or maybe that I know more than that sister does or that brother does I don't go and view it from their persp perspective and you know what God's going to do from his mercy and Grace he's going to knock me down until I'll look at it from the point of you that I've been begging him to let me look at it from and and that's harsh that's that sounds like a cruel God he's not cruel he's not cruel he saves us from ourself it's not just from Satan right he saves us from oursel that's true he he he saved us from Satan 2,000 years ago really before the foundation of the world but today it's work he has to save us from oursel every single day that's true I want to keep keep moving here uh uh uh time is going all right I I want to I want to there's something I always have believed and I just talk to you from my heart if that's okay um I don't believe that we should shape oursel according to the world would you agree with that okay um I don't believe that we should spend time looking at the world's doing or getting into the things of the world would you agree with that okay however I do think it's very valuable to see what is happening in the world to pay attention to what is happening in the world because that is a perspective that God is giving you to tell you the spirits that you see attacking the world are the spirits that are attacking you if you want a Viewpoint if you want a window into what you are going to be battling today or tomorrow or next week you need to look at what what's going on in the the world and that's where it's working that's where the spirit has won and it's taken control and that's the spirit you're going to be battling you say well I don't think that we're battling in the world oh let's let's just talk about it um the first the world is so divided right now and angry at one another right well at least America is everybody hates each other everybody's fighting everybody's split into politics or this issue or this issue doesn't it sound a lot like some of the churches sometime yeah maybe oh you saying oh it's we're not split into politics uh you haven't been in church very long sometimes it's politics or maybe it's just a Viewpoint of of the Bible or Viewpoint of the message or Viewpoint of this doct Viewpoint of this and all of a sudden in our church and in our belief we're just divided divided divided divided divided divided because you can see out in the world where it works and we battle that and that is the spirit we're battling and and and I'm going to go as far as even say this you know maybe the spirit that that right now is attacking our nation with with men who don't know that they're men and women that don't know they women you say I don't struggle with that issue but yet as a church spiritually sometimes we struggle with that issue we're not in our place we don't know who we are we don't know who we are that's comes right out of the message we don't know sometimes who we are there is an identity crisis I believe in the Believers today that we don't know who we are and all you see when you look at into the world and you see somebody who's confused about who they are that's where that spirit's working in the physical but in the spiritual we're being attacked by that or maybe you're not being attacked by that but I'm being attacked by that it's identity it's it's literally an identity crisis and it's all through the Bible when they take when they take Daniel and the Hebrew children and they take them over and they capture them and they're and they're living with foreigners they're living in the world the first thing that they try to do is get them to forget who they are wow they say we're going to change your names to these different names physical you say well we have the same name we've always had okay then they'll try then the second thing they did was try to change their diet physically how about spiritually you know what it's okay it's okay maybe just let brother Dan read the Bible and listen to the tapes and you just listen to what brother Dan says now I know brother Dan's not telling you that but I believe that spirit's attack that will tell you you know what you don't need to dig into that word for yourself just take whatever the the they're building the house just sit back and relax and let the house be built that's a spirit that's trying to take away your identity and I Know a Man LED from God I know brother Dan's LED from God because I think he'll be the first person to tell you you go get in that Bible you go pick up that bible you hit your knees you you read a message you read you read a scripture you do that so that when he comes out here and starts preaching you're like oh yeah I read that I know what that's about I know exactly where he said that oh you know what I hadn't heard that before but when I take what you just said and I take it with what I know I got a fresh new perspective right now CU it's just as dangerous for me to only have the perspective I of one Minister as it is just to have my own we are a we are a multi membered body which means think about it now we have every advantage over the devil we have every advantage over the devil because we have your perspective brother your perspective sister your perspective sister your your experience you've been through there's not something that the devil can attack you with that somebody in here hasn't gone through or is going through or you know the Lord brought me through that just come and talk to me a little bit and I'll tell you how he got me through that trial but if you want to sit over there by yourself and I don't know how I'm going to make it I don't know how I'm be delivered it's the devil forcing you to look at things just through your eyes but yet seek out somebody else you know what brother I I hate to bring this up but I know maybe you struggle with drinking how did you overcome that oh this is exactly how I overcame it now I don't know if this is going to work for you but here's how that Pulpit looks like from my point of view and I'll tell tell you what the word of God works like this if he did it one way for one person he'll do it same way for you but what you have to do is you have to go seek out how he did it for that person which takes you and I this is the hard part saying I don't know and that's like some of the hardest words is I don't know and I'm wrong and yet that is what God is asking of his people that's I don't have it with me but I I there is a quote that says that he wants you and I to say I am wrong because then only then can he actually teach you yes he's trying to do the same thing to us he's trying to get us to feed on I'm sorry but there's uh this may be unpopular opinion there's no good news I don't care if it's Fox News or CNN or this other website it's all the same thing I'm sorry there's no good political party I I I'm sorry there just isn't one yeah is there one that might be better than the other it's the it's the it's two sides of the same coin the goal is to bring down anybody who is a God's child there is no middle ground there is the seed of God and everything else there is no neutral party there is there are people that are certainly nice and kind but if they're not a seed of God they are against you that's a that's my perspective you don't have to accept that and you say well that sounds pretty cynical it's it's it's not cynical it's be guarded be guarded against yeah you you said it yesterday brother Dan you know we we are not looking at sometimes what God is doing today but we certainly look at what the devil is doing to us today that's a trick of the devil to keep your focus on his perspective oh he doesn't have control of me all he has to do is introduce a little bit of bad news a little bit of uh anxiety a little bit of uh bad feelings a little bit of this and pretty soon you're looking at your church your life your family your walk with God from Satan's perspective and if you look at it from his perspective I'm sorry but you're lost cuz he's telling you you're lost he's telling you you're no good he's telling you you can't be healed he's telling you you can't be delivered of that and if you listen to that you're seeing everything from his perspective and God's on the other side saying I've already delivered you I've already healed you I've already done these things but you need to look at it from my point of view but so many times in this message I'm just going to go I just let's go on a little tangent if that's okay uh okay A lot of times we hear in the message uh I'm the the sisters get real beat up sometimes when you listen to tapes when you listen to preaching it's always about how the sisters are dressed how the sisters hair how the sisters skirts how the sisters are doing this right and I believe in that I I believe in what it says and then a lot of times in the message brother bam will go okay now I'm going to talk to you uh Brothers for a little bit can I just talk to you Brothers for a little bit he'll say you men that'll let your wives do that and I just be honest brother Dan when I heard when I hear that you've heard it a lot right he I kind of was like oh that wasn't that bad right am I alone brothers or am I the only one that it was like man he kind of really he spent like five minutes like getting on the sisters and then when the men he's like and you men that'll let your wives do that and it was like one sentence I was like I wasn't too bad right oh was pretty good yeah and then what happens is now you don't have to say Amen to this part but what happens is is men will hear that and they'll go yeah you know what uh let's sit down wife you're dressing like this you're talking like this you're gossiping like this you're wearing this you're acting this way and and the and the and the message says that I shouldn't allow you to do that so now they take that little quote and they go and they start clubbing their wife over the head with it and trying to beat her into submission but really if you look at that quote from another point of view what brother randam is saying he's saying you men that let your wives do that meaning your wife is doing that because you spiritually or physically are doing that your wife is out of order because you're out of order and you say oh no no no my wife no you don't understand brother I tell my wife to do this I tell my wife to live this way I tell my wife to pray I tell my wife to to pray with our children you it's going to get quiet for me too because this is the truth I tell my wife to do this and and she doesn't listen to me me and the problem is is that she is listening to you she's doing exactly what you do so if she doesn't see you running your household like a man of God how is she going to run her household like a woman of God you say well I don't I don't dress him properly I don't do this but if you're not being the example of the household then the perspective that your wife has is you wow or or are we the kind of are we the kind let's just put on our spiritual thinking cap are the we kind of ministry or pastors or churches that tell somebody how to live but don't live it ourself we sometimes we have no problem telling somebody what's in the Bible oh if you just read what's in the Bible they said don't do that but are we living it wow are we the kind I'm sorry welcome to being the man of the house that's the man of the house oh man it's the man of the house right we're just the right brother brother Dan I don't envy your job is the pastor because you're the man of the house you're the man of the house and for our houses I'm sorry man but if something's going on in our houses you may not like me very much but this applies to me and I've been guilty of this and when I say I've been guilty I don't mean 10 years ago I mean like yesterday if your house is out of order they're doing they're following you that's not a pleasant perspective but if you want to see the the way to get through it you'll say Lord that's hard but I want to look at it from that perspective Lord how do I get in line so then my children and my wife look at me and I don't have to beat him in line with the message in the Bible and preaching just live it and watch them go oh I want to be that way oh that's how I want to be you give them A New Perspective I'm um I'm trying to hurry now he says I think I think we see the same thing today with uh I I I I feel like every everywhere I go I just head on Fellowship between churches but I feel like everywhere I go I see some I see in myself I see in our church I see that that is the battle W that's a battle to to have fellowship and and the reason why is because we don't always see the same way now I gave you the example brother Daniel saying that that's that's what that Pulpit looks like but now just just take the pulpit out of it and just add the Bible which now has you know thousands and thousands of words in it and let's not even talk about the message on top of that which has thousands and thousands of words and all the different points of view is a perfectly good reason not to have fellowship with somebody perfectly good reason right just it's a good reason they don't see it like I see it and I know I've been given Revelation so I must be right I don't think we ever like say that out loud but I think sometimes our actions are that way um but until you've walked a mile in their shoes sometimes individually and sometimes as a church as well I believe that this church has been through things that maybe another church hasn't been through would you say Amen to that am but they've also been through something you haven't been through you say I just don't understand how that church could see things that way maybe go walk a mile in their shoes maybe go up against the persecutions that they've been under maybe suffer like they've suffered and it's like somebody can battle just think about this somebody can battle I'm I'm going to confess to you a little bit like you know I have I have friends I have family members that battle battle anxiety and I haven't battled that and if I'm being honest with you it's very hard for me to see it from their perspective not that I don't care for them not that I don't pray for them not that I don't you know want Deliverance for them but I have a I have trouble empathizing I'm just I'm just bearing it all out for you right now it's the truth I'm not proud of it I have trouble understanding why you could be anxious for something because I don't have anxiety but yet that same person might look at me and go you battle with this that's that's like why would you battle with that you ever feel like I'm not going to tell anybody my battle because there's no way anybody else battles with this or there's no way anybody would even understand why I would be battling I've been a Christian for x amount of months years whatever it is I shouldn't be battling that I'm just going to hold that insight and keep it to myself and how is somebody else you know the Bible says confess your sins not to him one to another because what you've now done is you've now given somebody who has the right Spirit who's who's willing to get down with you and kneel and pray you've given them a perspective that they didn't have before and now they can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with you and they can go into that battle going okay Lord I don't battle this anxiety but I have been given a perspective of I never had before and and I just that's that's why I think it was so it's it's so beautiful when you see through the Bible you see it with Jesus and you see it of course in the message that that that the Lord allowed people's the discernment think about discernment now I'm just preaching about what we read about in the message there's a lot of times that ministers or or or people don't suffer through some of the things people suffer through well that's my timer they don't suffer I told you I ignore it but I was really trying to okay they don't suffer through things people suffer through and yet through discernment God allowed God allowed Jesus to see exactly what somebody was going through why so that he could enter in to that you know what discernment became in some of the prayer lines and even when you see it in the Bible it became a Viewpoint instantly into that person's life because how is even Jesus supposed to enter in for you if he wasn't tempted in all things and the Bible allowed him to be tempted in not some things if I'm telling you right now if you battle something in 2024 Jesus was tempted with it why so that he knows your perspective he knows what you're going through CU he's seen the world he's seen Satan and he's seen living life through that exact same perspective and yet without sin so that when he entered enters in with you it's true there's a scripture that says this I it's in John 16:12 it says if you want to write it down it says I have many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now now I love that scripture because one he's going to tell you many things and and you are going to be able to Bear them isn't that beautiful that he has a word for you that maybe today you couldn't handle how about the maybe this morning when you woke up you couldn't handle it but maybe right now you can that's how God does things just like that look through the Bible and see how many times God says the word immediately immediately when God does something well I better wait 20 years and then I can get this word from God I can bear you can bear it you might be able to Bear something right now that you couldn't bear five minutes ago because that's what the power of God changing your perspective can do for you and he says how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come every spirit-led person I believe your spirit-led you have to get out of your own way first that's like that's the hardest thing for us to do is get out of our own way we always want to say it's Satan in our way it's so and so in our way it's brother this it's brother that sister this it's work whatever it is I'm sorry but we're in our own way there there there's a quote I just love this quote it's so it's so small he says um uh I was told a little bit of time ago they had a jet plane that can make those noises we hear around shakes the windows when the plane has gotten so fast it crosses its own sound it's called the sound barrier and when it goes beyond its own sound listen to this when it goes beyond its own sound it's almost unlimited what it can do it's not it's not you going beyond the sound of your pastor it's not you going beyond the sound of ministry it's not you going beyond the sound of your church it's not you going beyond the sound of your your husband and your wife it's you going beyond your own sound which be which means your point of view your perspective all the things you think all the things you believe you've got to go beyond that and when and if you go beyond that because sometimes it's overwhelming is it overwhelming a little bit Danel like okay what perspective am I supposed to have now I'm really confused just step outside your own and the spirit of truth will be there to lead you to the perspective that is right for that time and that place but you have to be able to go beyond your own sound your own feelings your own opinion even your own experience and and your own Revelation no doubt they're good I I don't I don't take away anybody's experience but God has more experience I don't take away your salvation it's probably I I would say isn't it the greatest day of your life but there's more and if you can get beyond your own sound it's almost unlimited what you do don't worry about what perspective you need to go see the spirit of truth will lead you exactly where you need to go in that and he says and he can show you things that you've never seen and take you to places you've never been before I he didn't he didn't say that was for the newcomer the the the person who just became a Believer that's for every single one of us there are places in this word and in God you have never been before do you want to go there do you want to experience it do want to see things from a different angle from a different perspective every spirit-led person wants that it it it's so I love this he says maybe if your healings lingered a bit watch watch the perspective God has I think sometimes brother Dan I I'm praying for something and I don't it doesn't happen right away and I think this is what I think God must look at me and be like oh you're so like why aren't you getting it ah why aren't you just why aren't you doing this why aren't you believing this way why aren't you praying this way why aren't you just have faith that's what I would do God isn't me his ways are not my ways and and I got to tell you this he his ways are not your ways either you ever prayed for healing and you it didn't come you ever prayed for deliverance and it hasn't maybe you're doing that right now maybe if you're here's right out of the right out of the word maybe if your healing is Linger a little bit God has got confidence in you that you will hold on look at his perspective his perspective is the one I want and guess what he wants to give it to you in fact he's trying to do that right out of here out of two sentences but do I remember that when I'm going through the battle I'm attacked on all sides do I see it from his perspective I I'm I'm I'm I'm shoved down To The Ground by enemy do I see it from his perspective that I'm not no I'm not defeated I've not been beaten I'm not I'm not I'm not going to give up I don't know about you but there I'm not giving up I I do I feel like giving up yes I feel like giving up there's a lot of times I feel I just being honest with you there's times it's like oh this is It's hard I'm not giving up if it cost me my life if it cost me everything that I have I'm not giving up there's there's I believe that you have to claim that though brother Dan can't claim that for you brother brandom can't claim that for you Jesus himself cannot come down and claim that for you he cannot force his perspective upon you now what he'll do is he might knock you down you know there's there's a there's a guy we probably have heard of him there's a guy who is traveling on a horse to a town he didn't have a particularly good view of God in fact fact he persecuted those that believed in God Paul and he had a certain perspective when he's traveling down this road and in order he just wouldn't come to God but in order for him to come to God because he was a seed and the greatest sign the Bible says that you are mine is that I rebuke and chastise you sometimes the greatest sign that you're his is that he might let you get knocked down so that you can see it from a different point of view he literally knocks him off his horse now he's laying on the ground and I love this he goes and what does he see he sees a light he doesn't see he doesn't see anything but a light and he's and and he sees a light and yet the light speaks to him and says and it gives him an even higher perspective and says I'm not just a light I'm Jesus I'm not just a good scripture a good quote a good message I am Jesus if you want to see where I'm at literally gave him a new perspective there's there we're talking about Moses I'm I'm closing talking about Moses God looks at the children of Israel and you realize he gets so angry at the children of Israel that he says I'm going to wipe them out that doesn't sound like a very good perspective of God right and yet the spirit of God in Moses has a different perspective so God has a perspective he says you know what they make me so mad I'm just going to wipe him out and I'm going to start over and then God because he's balanced because he sees all things because he's looked at everything from every point of view because he's Eternal God himself in Moses said no let me give you a new perspective not new but let me show you where I'm looking at before you wipe them out you have to wipe me out God himself realizing not realizing because he doesn't learn anything new but God himself knowing I I need to see things from All Points of View it's not just enough that I can react angrily and wipe out the the people that I've worked so hard to deliver no no there's me over there saying oh no wait wait a minute walk a mile in my shoes come over here where I'm sitting I'm Daniel I'm sitting over here look at the children of isra from my point of view oh they're beautiful they're my children I love them I'm going to die for them and God being God is satisfied with with that to me that is like it it is the most like beautiful thing of God is that he doesn't do what I do he doesn't react upon a singular point of view he doesn't react upon emotion he doesn't react upon 10e of belief system built into him he doesn't react on those things he sees things from the proper perspective and I'm going to I'm going to close with this um is continuing that that that quote he says when you receive the holy spirit and get born again then the devil begins to tempt you you being tempted anybody being tempted all right that's good news from this perspective that's good news that means you got the Holy Spirit oh and he says oh you're wearing the same clothes and you look like you used to devil ever come and tell you I thought you were born again here you are thinking the same thoughts you used to think here are doing the same things you used to think he's trying his best to get you away from that New Perspective that you've been given but God changed you and you are sure that something happened inside of you and God changed your life and it doesn't make any difference what the devil says get away from it because you're sure that is God and he says we need one another now more than we ever did need one another I think about that meeting yesterday brother Dan we could go to the meeting and say you know what I didn't I don't agree with 100% of what every brother said but but I found myself thinking I I wonder what that man's been through that's really what I left wondering what has he been through to give him that point of view and I think if I could do that I I start to gain because here's the beautiful thing about God is when he gives you a new perspective you actually still keep that old one he just grows you into a house he grows you into a Christian he grows you into a child of God you don't have to you don't have to lose what you've known the Bible says I think it's in in in Peter about the stature add to yourself add to your perspective this and you start to get this this picture of who we should be as as a Christian and I I had other notes but I think I think I've taken the time that I need to take and I I pray that that that even just in these broken words that you could it doesn't matter how old you are how young you are look at this look at things from a different perspective and are there wrong persp of course there wrong perspectives if something's telling you that you're defeated take them right back over here right back over here to this Bible oh no no I'm sorry Satan you you're can attack me from all sides but you cannot defeat me you know what I may be down but I'm not dismayed I'm sorry if somebody's has given you that perspective you can feel free by the by the word of God to reject that perspective but if it's something that you don't understand let the spirit of Truth lead you where it's going to lead you amen let's just let's just stand I'll turn over to brother Dan I thank you for the for the extra time I hope I used it used it well so God bless you stay here okay brothers and sisters that was good do you appreciate that oh I uh I got to say I'm not usually like this but I wish I had a couple hours now to preach man that was really good that got me excited that was that was exactly exactly if it was for no one else it was for me brothers and sisters that was good you know what you know what I was thinking when he was closing you know I was thinking God has perspective and I thank God that through the blood of Jesus Christ through his son Jesus Christ that he is able to lower himself to see things from our perspective and I than that he is a high priest as being that is able to be touched by by our Feelings by our our sicknesses by our needs and as he was closing I was thinking the devil has a perspective too and one day it's going to be [Applause] y the bottom of the souls of the feet of God's Saints one day it's going to be that way and by the grace of God by the grace of God Jesus Christ is our he is the Conqueror amen he is our Champion brother brandham said one time as our brother was was preaching brother brandham said that to truly have your prayers heard for someone else is to be able to enter into that person's suffering to be able to get down and to see and to feel that person's pain to put it in brother Ryan's words to be able to see from that brother or that sister's perspective and then when you can really enter into that suffering that is when you're able to get through to the Lord in prayer for that person brothers and sisters as as our brother was was speaking I was I was I I was so thankful that not only are we trying to to see other people's perspectives but Jesus Christ sees from our perspective and he mentioned Moses and brother brandom always said he said many many times he said how could Moses have a better idea than God had when he was saying Lord that you should go back on your judgment of the people and let me tell you something that was not Moses speaking that was not a man speaking right there was none other than the spirit of Jesus Christ speaking through that prophet and making intercession is a foreshadow of what was coming when the man died on the cross and he gave God another perspective and instead of looking at me brother Joe instead of looking at you his perspective was looking at his perfect virgin born son of God and the perfectness of Jesus Christ is God's perspective on us brothers and sisters please take heed to what our brother said and look at things from other perspectives other than yourselves look in every situation when you get angry when you get frustrated look at someone else's perspective it's not always we don't always want to look through things through our eyes look through things from other people's eyes eyes and as a brother said Walk In Those Shoes brother Josiah Made for [Music] More I know who I am cuz I Know Who You Are [Music] the cross of Salvation was only the star now I am [Music] chosen free and forgi I have a future and it's worth living I know who I am I know who I am just thank the Lord cuz I know who you are the cross of Salvation was only to start now I am [Music] chosen free and [Music] forgi I
