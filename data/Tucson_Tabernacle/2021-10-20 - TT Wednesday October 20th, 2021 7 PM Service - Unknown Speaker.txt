once i was blind but now the light i see once i was dead but now in christ i need to tell the world around the peace [Music] be good he first loved me [Music] and purchased [Music] um [Music] you may be seated tonight we're going to be listening to a prisoner from 1963 july 17th i won't be starting it brother and i had to start paragraph 38 it'll be about an hour now let us turn over to a little book that i never spoke out of before in my life and it's a very just one chapter it's a book a film and i'm just a little bit irish and i do have a wall around the bottom teeth to hold a couple of them back in place uh i sometimes i don't pronounce these names right when i do know what they are and sometimes i can't pronounce them right for the lack of education so bulimia someone said back there which i think is really the correct pronunciation of it now the first verse i want to take just a word or two for it paul a prisoner of jesus christ and that's what i want to use tonight as a text the lord willing is a prisoner [Music] now you can hardly imagine paul regarding himself a prisoner a born free man filled with the holy spirit but yet he calls himself a prisoner and now we find out when he's addressing the corinthians paul an apostle of jesus christ another time paul a servant of jesus christ by the will of god when he's speaking to timothy different one now when he's writing here to slingman he says paul a prisoner here now this little kid has never exactly seen himself like that so he comes to the city to visit his grandma and at the on the room the grandma had a house that had a complete mare on the door and so it was all like running through the room seen another little boy in front of him and the little boy was running also so he thought he should stop a few minutes to see what the little lad was going to dude and when he stopped the little boy stop returning he said the little boy turned his head he scratched his head the little guy scratched his body walked closer to investigate and he turned around and his mother watched him and his grandmother was amazement said well my mother that's me so i said that we too are reflecting something see our life is reflected and now if we lived in the days of north whose side would we take what sides are we talking about great uh or today that noah what size would we talk in the days of moses what side in the days of elijah the prophet when all the world was golfed up in a a great a mess of uh of modernism like the modern jezebel and and let all the servants of the lord out into a whirly way in the church the priest is all bound to her would you tuck the side of popularity or we're just stupid elijah now in the days of the lord jesus when we think of this unpopular person uneducated by the world those schools they could ever find that he went to and no no seminary experience and and then raised up with the name of illegitimate birth and that cut out preaching a gospel that was contrary to anything that they had been taught in condemning the ministers in their organizations and so forth and the organizations that made uh a statement if anybody even went to hear the so-called prophets would be put out of the synagogue which was a a mortal sin there had to be a account only the worshipers earned the blood of the lamb they had to come to this sacrifice and and then they were outcasting what a great thing it was and this man ignored such as that and yet he was perfectly with the scripture but not in the way they knew it what side would you touch see neither your life that you live now reflects now just what you would have done then because you still are possessed with the same spirit if you take that side down with them you'd have done it dang it because the same spirit that's in you now within people then see the devil never takes his spirit he just goes off one man on to another god never takes his spirit peter it goes from one to the other see so the very spirit is up on elijah come upon elisha same one on john the baptist and so forth the holy spirit was up on christ come upon the disciples all down and still upon the people you see god never takes his spirit so there we are left to make a choice and i i can't see here where paul was regretting uh anything and saying he was sorry he was a prisoner but he's addressing himself i believe that paul as he wrote this letter with that pen that it was the holy spirit causing him to write that that maybe even to this night that we might pull out the context of our text to show why paul says it's because his scripture and scripture is eternal i believe it's sitting in this dingy old jail that paul wrote the uh to his party here that his brother that he was a prisoner of jesus christ so he could express it by seeing what was around while he was in jail but that wasn't what he was speaking to this uh this uh servant of christ minister with him he was speaking that he was a prisoner to the word of jesus christ because christ is the word yes and paul had been a great scholar in his days he had great ambitions he was uh he was a a man that had been trained with uh by uh people uh fellows by the name of gamalia which was a great teacher obviously one of the greatest schools that he could have went to for instance like we say wheatner bob jones or some great fundamental school had been taught as as a minister of the word and he was well educated and smart and an intelligent boy with a great ambition maybe someday becoming a priest or a high priest to his people he had an ambition and then to find that these great ambitions he'd been trained for he spent all his life for maybe a age of about uh eight or ten years old up to about 30 or 35 when he finished college and graduated and had all these diplomas and everything and stood in good with all the clergy even to the high priest at jerusalem he had had orders from him personal orders written and trusted with this great soul to go down to damascus and to find all those down there that worship god contrary to what he said and to find him and put him in jail the necessary letters to put him to death if he wanted to he was at great ambitions and now all [Music] his father has spent his money for and the ambitions of his father and mother was all had been taken away from him because god had something else therefore he was a prisoner from his objective that he had in life and he become a prisoner to jesus christ who was the word amen that road to damascus changed paul going down about 11 o'clock the rest of the day he was stricken down and he heard a voice saying sorrow while persecuted and he looked up and looking up being a jew and know that pillar of fire was the lord that led to children of israel because he knew that's what it was remember this hebrew would have never called any language capital l rd elohim unless you've been satisfied that's what it was because he was trained scholar and when he looked up and he seen this alive a purifier that had let his people through the wilderness and uh he said lord elohim not the lord lord who are you i'm not a surprise it must have been to this theologian to say i'm jesus the very bond that he was so against wire all turned around oh it must have been something terrific for this man but all his ambitions that he had to find out all at once he'd been persecuting his ambitions that drove into us away from the main thing that he meant to do and what a great shock it must have been to this apostle when he said i was jesus the very one that he was persecuting why persecutors found me amen another little uh quotation we're not dropping here you see as they make fun of the church they're not really making fun of the church they are making fun of jesus amen hallelujah why persecuted stop me how could paul alone with all these interests believe that this was this group that he was persecuting was the very god that he claimed to be serving i think that's without going into details i think we're all well trained enough to know what i mean here and the same thing is happening today ignorance yet intelligent and than smart uneducated galileans that he was persecuting that had already ended humility accepted this man as lord but paul in his great teaching and his intellectuals cannot accept that and what a turnaround it must be to him on this road and he was stricken blind so he would not carry out his commission but was led down to a place in a street called straight in the house of one and then come the prophet down there in the name of ananias who saw a vision him coming down so old as that went down to where he was and went in and said brother saul the lord appeared to you on the low down sent me that i might lay my hands up on you and you received your sight and be filled with the holy ghost [Music] father what a thing it must have been for paul see all that he had been trained to do was vice versa with all the education he had it it was just become naught to him now he knew that he had an experience so here's another good lesson for that experience alone isn't enough ever it's got to be experienced according to the word of the lord so him seen this and know that it was a great something that if somebody else had received it before him he took three years and six months down in the desert in arabia taking the the bible as it was in the old testament and going down there to uh to compare this experience that he had had and see if it was scripture and now it was he said well i guess that was just a little blow over and went on i hope i was interested he had to become a prisoner to something a prisoner so after comparing it and seeing no one that he could write the book of hebrews see three years and a half hour laying in the word and finding out that the very god that called him was taking him back and changing all of his interests changing all of the illegal already trained to be always ambitious just washed it away from him and he became a prisoner the love of god had been so tremendous and such a revelation that he could not get away from it amen that's the true experience of every real believer who meets god hallelujah you you come in contact with something that's so great that you that you become a prisoner to everything else you you get away from everything to imprison yourself to this it's expressed one time when jesus said the kingdom of heaven is something like a man buying pearls now when he finds that great pearl he sells everything he's got to get that one and that's why here you you have an intellectual conception you have a a a theological experience but when it comes to a time that when you [Music] paul knew what it was he was he found out that he was hardest to something a horse and a harness it's the it's the pull of something and paul knew after this experience and three years and a half of typing the experience he had with the bible he realized that god had chosen him as harvesting by the holy spirit the experience that he had to pull the gospel in the presence of the gentiles the spirit itself harnessing and today as servants of christ we become harvest hooked up we can't go over the last thing with us amen honest to the world no matter what anyone else says your heart is touched there's something about it that you just can't get away from you've been yourself with it by the holy ghost has got you to the world no matter what anyone else says it's the lord that's always harnessed upper lip put in the opening to the word by the spirit even horns he had lying on the back side of the arabian bridge right there when all these former things and experiences and ambitions have been stripped of those things now that's what we find today that we must be strict first and people don't want to be stripped [Music] but you've got to absolutely be sick of everything amen and just blonde again afresh and take up from there that the holy spirit leaves you my daddy said when he got him went to the church he shook hands with the pastor he's a good lawyer now we must come back to the bible times for this day the priest was harnessed too but you see they'll come over into another dispensation and they failed to strip off their own harness and put on a new harness and the same thing we find today we did come through a denominational age as we prove through the church ages survival and so forth but we've come now to a free age where the holy spirit himself comes down and vindicates himself and makes himself known makes every promise that he promised come to pay oh my what a good time and he knew that another thing he knew he could not go to places that being harnessed to this that he will not if he didn't he wanted to go he knew that his ambition draw him amongst brethren amen he was invited to come and yet he was pressed in the spirit to [Music] we've got the biggest church we've got the biggest congregation your offense will be great and so forth but being pressed in the spirit he thought i got a brother over there i'd like to go over and save this brother to the lord but yes the spirit pushed him to go somewhere else he was a prisoner amen correctly oh god make us prisoners like that hallelujah from our own selfish ambitions and from our own thinking could be a prisoner of jesus christ i think that was a great statement for you i'm a prisoner to jesus christ and remember he is the word see i don't know what anyone else thinks it's the word see if you're pleaser to the word no denomination can sway you from it it's just a word you're just you're a prisoner to it that's all you can act the way it acts now he cannot go certain places that he wanted but called why the spirit for obeying him amen you remember many times that paul would try to grow something thinking that's why i could have a great need but the spirit would forbid him now does that clearly state and prove that paul was a prisoner yes amen a prisoner to jesus christ harmless to his word by the spirit oh i like that he was down he was bound by a chain the feathers of love to do your will of god and that only amen he he was a force of love he was in the yoke with christ amen he said your trust was nothing else he was ghosted with him and one of the league that's [Music] [Music] that we can completely surrender ourselves into your coming [Music] [Music] [Music] my heart is [Music] was correctly a prisoner he wasn't making any wrong statement he was trained by the holy ghost again to wait on the word now he can train one way but but god had trained him another way now he was trained by the holy spirit to wait upon the law no matter what his ambitions were now i'm going to uh hope for the holy spirit show you something now let's just take an instant one day paul and silas coming down the street in a certain city we're just holding a revival and a little demon-possessed girl kept falling crying out entry no doubt what paul knows that he has the authority as an apostle to rebuke that evil spirit out of that woman but did you notice he waited day after day until all of a sudden the holy spirit spoke to me amen this is the hour and he says come out of her see he know to wait on the lord and that is where so many people they reproach upon the word they go out with an ambition how many revivals have been left back because of a thing like that because the advantages don't work to see what the lord's got to say someone said come over here and they they call right now because the association says go and the holy spirit would say something different yet the ambition of the man to become the state president or something other or some uh editor or some bishop or something with points you must go and what he knows better the holy spirit saying go here see he got to his organization it's a it's a sounding blast and a healing symbol he hears only the voice of god and he speaks only when he comes out he says nothing somebody say oh oh brother jones uh brother roberts or some these great man in our lands today like uh connie hicks or or uh oral roberts or or a little connie audrey some of those great it's time to say hey come over here tommy you're a great man of god a world and i i got a uh uncle that's right over here it's all bound and he's uh he's sick i want you to come over i believe you have the strength to heal you see i know the holy spirit would say dream not now but yet to the friendship of that man he's duty back to go with him if he don't he becomes an enemy to that name that man said well he wants the throwing source he or that child out of that boy i know he did and i get his friend free here and he wouldn't come to my place but if he's constrained by the holy spirit not to go he better not go if he speaks to god his friend he loves the holy spirit courts it won't do any good anymore i experienced that so many times but paul just waited for the spirit to tell him what to do and watched out ever foreign a crippled man and all once the spirit spoke in yeah and he said i perceive [Music] the same way he perceives is going to be arrested on an island i perceive that you have [Music] to say see you would yoke to that appeal now you say brother then you're condemning what you said sonny about you've been waiting all this time but you remember it was the holy spirit that spoke to me yesterday on their own instead of sending you back amongst the sickening it's obedience to the holy spirit i didn't go until he told me to do it i was waiting for thus saith the lord until i got the saith the lord now it makes a difference yes he waited for an award along he was pressed in the spirit to do only god's bidding that he become a pleasure of jesus christ friends if we could only become prisoners that was hot but i like to name a couple more characters but i like the name just another character too let's take the character mode he was uh born a deliverer and he he knew that that he was born a deliverer but before i say about moses i'd like to make this statement that god always has to pick any man that was serving truly to be his prisoner a man has to surrender every ambition he's got everything that he is every everything is life soul bodies will ambitions and everything else and become a complete a prisoner to christ who is the word to serve god you might have to walk contrary to a bitter judgment maybe to a certain organization you might think that they could lift you up and give you something good that you might play but what do you find yourself you find yourself defeated after a while until god can get a man that's willing to become a prisoner to him god is looking for prisoners he's always done you might search into the scripture a man has to be a prisoner to christ against anything therefore you cannot be connected with anything but christ amen even your father your mother your brother your sister your husband your wife anybody you're only connected with christ and him only then god can use you until then you can't oh yeah it speaks up what the people see i'm trying to get you to cut loose you got to have a starting place like uh sometimes called out the wind and bobbing their hair and wearing these clothes and and maintain their christian profession hey that's the little thing but you've got to start somewhere somebody get it out there on your abc's and cut this down he looks anyhow and become a prison to cry and then just keep on cut loose everything to find the last lines cut loose then you're you are a prisoner and you become in his grip he's got you in his crib now moses knows that he was born to deliver he knew that and did you notice with the ambition that moses had knowing his mother had told him over there she was his first baby no doubt when moses the little baby was born that his mother said you know moses then your dad a man and i pray constantly we know what is seen in the word it was time for the coming of the liver and we pray lord god we want to see that deliver one night your life told us to division that you would be born and you'd be delivered we mustn't pray to the king's commandment we didn't care what the king said then we know that you were born a deliverer now moses we know that we couldn't bring you up right i remember they've been down there 400 years in egypt see and we wanted to get you the the right thing the right education around right training so i'll talk to you and put you in the real art it sets you up into the nod and how strange is the curse taking that little art down through the reeds and rushes and brought it right down miles away and turned it right into pharaoh's palace where uh his favorite daughter was uh where the dating pool was and how at our moment need a woman to asian and in that days of course they didn't have these bottles to raise the babies on so did that have a wet nurse so and mariam i sent her down she stood there and she said well i don't know where i can find a wet nurse and come and got me and moses the doors are all shut honey you're 16 years old now and you're going to be filling your son and someday you're going to be the deliverer that's going to take the people out of here moses ambitious beginners i'll study mother i'll study everything i can you know what i'll do i'll study how to be a military man and i don't know how to take these people out here i'll be a great general bishop you know i know how it's done i'll i'll take it out i'll get my phd here i'll do it my father's genetic chimney if you ever read these books all right he's going to deliver all the protestants you know when he become one himself so this great priest years ago father kennedy you know what you get his book really if you call him father and just his brother trinity what it was we don't call homie father like that so we find him let me uh he's going to read the bible so we could get out there and disprove the process of religion the big law accounting why would read the bible the holy spirit come before him he got the legal [Music] so then notice this that moses got all the training because he he knew he was so smart [Music] psychologist he could teach her the general what military might love was a great man and people feared moses because of his greatest soul was such a scholarship man he was an archbishop but maybe like a pope he was a great fellow and he was a a mighty man and he know that he was born to do this and had trained with great ambitions to do it just like today i don't say that man training in these schools i don't say that like you're out here in the west now they're going to build a 150 million dollar uh school of theology see pentecostal uh 150 million dollar school to me that should be missionaries in the field but what is it what did he do when he come out of there bunch of ricky just did that and then that's how they come out with always have the rest of them and that's the same line see now we find out that when uh moses in all this training and today with all the training making big bishops and so forth with great high ambitions what do we do our ambitions become just about like what moses was see god before he could get the man in his hand he has a stripping of his ambition he had a stripping of all his training he did go out and he delivered he killed one egyptian and he uh and when he did he found out that he was in the wrong he couldn't do that it wasn't that way and god had to take him out into the wilderness into the desert a desert place you notice kind of strange how these fellows that god got a message for him he takes them into a desert he took paul to the desert yeah to train to tell him what all this great vision was out into the desert we actually sit in desert and he stayed there until god fully made no one what to do and he knows his time he took him out in the desert kept him out there for 40 years and stripped him of all his theology and all his ambition oh a lot of time that he could look back and see his failure and how we tonight ought to do the same thing when we see our ambition look at the healing campaign as soon as the law did something a few years ago to start restoring healing to the sick and so forth everybody every organization because they didn't come into their organization they had to get them a healer and what have we done let's look at it just a moment we have done the same thing that moses did we went out and tried so hard to manufacture some kind of america i smelt a disease i i got blood in my hand a manufacturer of merit lord help see and what have we got a man in such hard street just broke up and become regular drunkards now right and got their minds and switched all the way back to the art from the pentecostal objective back to making organizations and things again that's right and we tried we streamed we paid we labored all night long and proud meetings too we had no and trying to manufacture some and shoot up something and all these kinds of things and find us to be a total failure we're here going back to the desert amen right yes sir that's what you ought to do hey man go back and give up why we've done the same thing they did same thing moses did that doesn't do any good after 40 years he found himself a prisoner to the word of god what are we trying to do when the great blessing come out and the manifestation of all these great things that god has told us about how that we must be born again how we have received the holy ghost the baptism in the name of jesus christ and all these things here you see people instead of staying to that word harnessed to it what did they do they started with their own denominational theory which had already failed and try to manufacture something to look like the truth oh hell i better cut off right there i'm sure you're wise enough to know what i mean see but why look what it's done thank god what have we got tonight but uh a nation full of organized people who the scriptures of god amen who would call the light of the holy spirit that it was a mental empathy who would refuse such to come into their church and there wasn't permission to mention one word a separate seed eternal security and the things that the holy spirit has repeatedly proved to be the challenge that your challenge to coming from what have they got the same thing that lose their hand the rest of them see flew an egyptian what not what was it maybe he made some man start stop stealing or maybe live true to his wife [Music] see that stinking dead man was always under your face fingers too of his success of 40 years of training a stinking egyptian laying out rotten and dead that's about the way it is tonight the only thing we can talk to this rebound has crossed over so close is the stake in front of church members that knows more about [Music] that's an awful thing that's a point back to you for all the streams and struggles and everything we got maybe we could point to a big school but it's dead amen we just wanted an organization but it's dead it's stinking it's just like the first thing that we've pulled out of like oh going to this while in adulthood [Music] called for that i don't know if you lost the feeling of the people's messenger well why aren't you out on doing this why are trying this why don't you go on with the rest of them moses is out there getting stripped although he had an experience of the burning bush that declared the word i am the god of abraham isaac and jacob and i remember my father and i'll come down to the liver and i'm sending you to do it uh he's seen the word not the ambition of the people or the desires of the people then what did he become he did not want to face the egyptians anymore he didn't want to face this thing anymore they become a priest amen 40 years and stripping down but then he become a prisoner at the burning bush the mighty moses was all of his intellect the bible saying that moses was a mighty man and were in egypt but watch what the mighty theologian did in the presence of the burning bush he always confessed his inability amen when he seen the genuine purpose of god what can you do [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i want to talk to you get yourself down even your shoes you're flying on the ground again don't want to talk to them couldn't even talk i are elected prisoner a elected prophet just like all was elected moses was elected delivered and then finally [Music] [Music] [Music] that's how you gonna take it over that was his training so what you got in your hand a stick god does seem so ridiculous sometimes to the human mind got a stick in his hand whiskers hanging down 80 years old wife on mule deep sitting on the hood little flabby arms hanging down the stick just his head up boy he has dusted us [Music] conditions [Music] to do the first step tonight surrender amen become a prisoner don't think of yourself or something else become a prisoner moses become a prisoner confess he couldn't even talk finally when god got him in his hand where he could only lose where god moved him he told him the word he know what was the word then he submitted himself to the lord and the holy spirit that god promised moses to the will of god that's the same thing he's done to paul that's right man he harnessed paul little crooked dose that tastic juice oh was phd in lld's all over me but he said i'm going to show him why he's going to suffer for the worst thing and that's paul's sitting there and seeing the word and seeing that love jesus there he went moses i am the god of your fathers i'm the god of abraham isaac and of jacob i remember in the time of the promises here and i see the afflictions of my people i remember my promise and ohio come down the horn of shoes you know what the word says now force you to go down there or is she with power to go down there and deliver [Music] because you've seen a miracle done by just like david was a slingshot harnessed himself and he went down finally god had a man that was subject to him harnessed to him and could not move until the word of god moved if people just do that today then he was his prisoner a prisoner of love yoked up in the bond of love with with god is paul was yourself in the bond of love to god just like paul both of them trained the same way moses trained you know to deliver the children of israel by military pilot to take it out of the hands of romans and brought him clean by great ecclesiastical force in the world that day great schools of training come up under the media and both of them went to the desert come back different man both of them [Music] [Music] left their homes and went to the desert to find out left their peoples and everything to find the will of god see they were trained in one way god changed them to another and they had to become a complete prisoner to not act in the way that they wanted to act but act in a way that god wanted them to act he's ashamed yesterday today and forever have we got another 10 minutes i really get to another character i see one before me now his name is joseph he was an elected son he was a perfect type of jesus christ he was born a prophet he's a prophet also and now he could see vision and when his young boy he saw a vision of himself sitting on the throne in his brother's bathroom of what he was kind of felt like he was a great guy see all of us what did god have to do he done the same thing that he did to the rest of him because moses was a deliverer paul was a deliverer and now joseph was a deliverer he saved his people from the family what did god have to do to him put him in prison yes sir remember he was stolen by his brother to an egyptian and they sold him to prompter and apostle uh give him a little bit of liberty and uh first thing you know that was taken from me and they is set in the prison cry crying god had to strip it now notice but all the time i believe in that prison he could remember that the vengeance said that he's going to sit on the throne and his brothers was going to bounce him because he knew that his gift come from god and he knew that it had to come to pass if we could only keep that in our mind but according to the world of god in this last days he's going to have a church he's going to have a people and these things that he promised he's going to do [Music] yeah i want to be shutting with god that's where i thought about this being shut in with god nothing else you only move when god says move you only do as god said then you're shut in with god i remember he was thinking he also became a total failure to himself all that he knew all that he understood and everything he'd become a total failure it didn't work he was put under a situation that nobody would listen to him he was a prisoner see he was put into a situation that unbelievers would not believe that his ministry was a matter of fact what's good what is this you do he might stand to the prison bars and please foreign [Music] amen hallelujah god came in his prison like paul like all the wisdom he came to him and he used the gift that he had given to get him out of there what did he do as soon as he rose from his prison he was given power that he was under he was brought from the prison house and gave us powers for whatever he said had to happen amen [Music] is [Music] is and become a president of the word of god that he can only say what god said it is not to say then god moves through that lord [Music] [Music] oh i just got about three more minutes we find out that he become a prisoner to god from the prison to the world from all the same way and moses is the same way from a pleasure to his own thinking to a prisoner to god and when he come out he had the power of god and when he become paul when the old thinking of moses he was surrendered and stripped of it he become a prisoner to christ's word could only move wherever you say christ he has stained the repulsive christ greater treasures than that of egypt so he was a prisoner of crisis like paul remember all three of them were prophets see and they had the best of their own thinking in order to become a prisoner to the will and the ways of god and we remember it now that he has power to divine that his own word he has power to loose at his own word he can say i lose you in the name of my king amen [Music] christ makes his prisoners of love his sons amen amen the same thing he has things on forcing paul he that's believers on me the the worst that i do shall he do also even more than this shall he do the prisoner of the love of christ becomes empowered by his king who is christ amen and very i say unto you if you save this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said will come to ask you about what you said amen if you about me in my word in you if you're a yoke to me because him and his words of faith in the beginning my poor words with god the words may bless the lord and mother saying yesterday forever [Music] before he come out he had to be taken out and shaved a few things had to be shaved off before he meet his king oh god sometimes pitches people out like that and shaves a few of their own wheels off chosen that they can't do this what they wanted to do you know what i mean they're not they're not liberty to do what they want to do before they can come into full power and be a lost slave to class they have to be shaved off and then presented sometimes he takes them to the deserts to do that to shave them all and then bring them out the anointed one to fulfill the purpose that he's already gained them to be a little brothers we're at the end time remember all other times what he's done he's always had to take a man and make him a prisoner to him for say he's on he had to forsake everything that he knows forget all these trainings and everything in order to know the will of god and to follow god he can't follow anything that man's got to do and god's at the same time it's too contrary one to another you can't be going east and west at the same time you can't be going uh right left at the same time you can't be doing right and wrong at the same time you can't be following man and god at the same time no sir you're either following god a fallen man now then if you are following god and have submitted yourself to god then you become a prisoner to that god to that word to that will no matter what anything else is you become a prisoner to it listen we're at the end times and i would say this with reverence and respect as the last couple of minutes is floating by look very much what god to my opinion will do and must do and will do and this last day is to find the tool for the heart you've got to find the tools to thrash the floor any farmer when he goes to his harvest he has to have a tool to do it with so you've got to have a sharp sickle or something some instrument to flash out the grain and the harvest is right god take us in your hands make a spawn servant of your love and use it for truth to bring the realization to this sinful cursed earth that we're living in today that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever for myself god let me be a prisoner if all my brethren turned me down if all my friends turned me down i want to be a prisoner of jesus christ and his word that i might be harnessed to his word by the holy spirit to see the holy spirit make the word of god be confirmed by the same things that he said would be i want to be a prisoner of jesus christ let us pray i wonder tonight with our heads down if that ambition that we have of being something else or maybe a of something that we might think be a selfish thing wonder if we couldn't just kind of have laid out a sign i wonder if if some young boy here tonight look around and say i'm going to be when i get big i'm going to be a certain certain thing i wonder if you could feel the will of god move in your life and say no no my ambitions are lost now the last few days the holy spirit has been speaking to me i i want to heal myself to god to be a thrashing instrument of this last thing some young girl that might have ambitions of her fine lady character or maybe uh be a pretty little misses or maybe someday make hollywood your career i wonder if you're not willing now to submit your ambitions in the presence of god in his word here's a call of god in your own life god knows who you are i want us to be a minister close or a servant a worker somewhere in church i just sit in here once i don't know one-third of the people sitting here tonight but i just don't handle that's here but i wonder if there'd be such a person that you'd be willing to say i don't care what anyone says i'm god's slave now i'm going to preach his work regardless i don't care what my my organization turns me out i'm still going to say that word i'm going to do it my will is god's will god's will is my will i'm going to be a prisoner of jesus christ by his grace and help him i'll do it think of it while we have our heads down how many's got that ambition tonight would you raise your hand that's my issue i surrender oh with our heads out now slowly now as you think it over now as you prayed [Music] oh [Music] hi [Music] take me hmm to the father's house tonight bring you all up know me over again [Music] heavenly father as the song continues to play i thought it most possible at this time that i i break in on the song and talk to you just a moment as the people are thinking i surrender all father may we do this with black as this is our last opportunity to do it let us come with sincerity come unto the table of the lord as it was with washed garment wars souls washed ambition to surrender ourselves and let god take his word yoke is us up together with it god's word he made the holy spirit take us now as we hear that you'll take around our hearts from tonight on i'll take you to your word now don't think you're all thinking think my thoughts thank my will i will leave god's granted it'll be an experience to every one of us these young people sitting here husband and wife and some coming to be a husband and wife there's older man sitting here that's ministers then along the road his largest living devil ah getting way up on the ladder our days are being numbered now our steps are made more careful in what we did make them we watch where we step we're not as sure put it physically speaking as we once were but all this we see that more life is fading out and none of our footsteps are sure without you got our hand now god take us when you take our hearts and our will in your own hands let us become prisoners tonight to the word to christ may we live godly lives here ladies women these young women these young man boys and girls surrendered their lives lord and made their ambitions become the ambition to serve jesus christ and let become a prisoner of his divine grace and will grant [Music] these little broke up words and i trust that you'll put them together rightly because it's hot in here and people want to listen but it's real long and many have to go home and go to work early but they don't see just lay into their heart a prison go home and say to the wives as they get ready to get out and pray this afternoon or this evening by the bedside look across to one another and say dear what about that tonight have we really become prisoners that's christ young men and young women everywhere especially those who've heard the message night ask themselves that same question am i willing to become a prisoner forsaking my own life he that saves his life shall lose it but he that will lose this life for my sake shall find it father we know that it's become a prisoner of you lose our own ambitions and our own desires to find joy and we have eternal life granted lord only thing i know is to commit it now into your hands and may become fruitful and bring forth great all great tools for the last day harvest man and women boys and girls surrendered to the complete will of god and become prisoners of jesus christ for his love shackled with fears of divine love we asked it in his name ah [Music] [Music] maybe just take a moment in each as we've heard the word and see is there some things lord that i've not surrendered there are some things in my life that i i'm still wanting to hold on to that if i would let it go lord you you would have your own way maybe we just bow our heads lord we heard this message of prisoner lord it goes contrary to our human nature to want to be a prisoner it's the lord we've seen through the testimony of your word that a person that has surrendered and yield to god has the greatest liberty that there is to live the life of a christian to have joy to have peace and to have satisfaction lord in life so lord just allow us to look at ourselves and say lord help me to let go of this help me to yield this and surrender myself completely to you as our prayer jesus lord prepare me to be a sanctuary [Music] pure and hope [Music] for you [Music] yes lord prepare me to be a sanctuary pure and holy tried and true [Music] [Applause] [Music] sanctuary [Music] take a moment and think at the end of this life as a prisoner has the greatest reward that there is he said to him that overcometh over cometh what this guy this person and yield all of that and let god be god amen did brother nolan's sister surely make it home okay i think the lord is thinking about them today just take trusting that the word of god has spoken to our hearts and just reminded us of things that maybe lord i need to yield that i need to give up that i need and then find out later you say why did i hold on to that for so long it's been better to be a prisoner of christ than a prisoner of my own ideas ambitions and wants and can never never fulfill what we really wanted to sow amen and i thought as i was thinking of that song to be a sanctuary for you and then i could say so let the storms rage high the storms contra they won't worry me anymore because i'm sheltered safe in the arms of god [Music] within the arms of god he walks with me and [Music] shall turn on put that first verse [Music] me [Music] i have no fear when jesus walks beside me shaltered within the arms of god [Music] within the arms of god he walks with [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] shalters of god
