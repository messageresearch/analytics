um passed away and um the family is going to have we're gonna have a service here on Friday evening November 1st at 7M I'll put it up on the website I'll send it out on the WhatsApp that is next Friday at 700 p.m. here at the Tabernacle and I know the G family would appreciate it if you would come I'm sure we'll have a lot of people um to pay respects to a real true man of God um and keep the family in prayer as they go through this time there's a there's a time of quiet and then we'll have the service and uh you know it'll stir things back up and then then there is that hard time after that where they just get get back to normal life um for tonight I encourage everyone to come and invite your friends especially the uh the younger ones we're going to brother Lyall and I are going to teach on the Book of Jonah and uh we're going to have a little surprise during service and then we're going to have uh fish tacos afterwards and we'll have an alternative if you don't like like fish it'd be a good time I think that we'll enjoy ourselves in learning about this man of God Jonah and his book and and then enjoying just enjoying some fellowship it just feels good to be with each other last speaking of Fellowship last night um we uh man we had a great time how many were there last night with the kids wasn't it good it was just a good time that we all got together and we watched the first episode of this real Masterpiece called The Chosen and and it was about Mary Magdalene and we we got introduced to Matthew and we got introduced to Simon Peter and to his brother Andrew and then at the very end man we got a glimpse of the Lord Jesus and it was powerful it was just just to see when Jesus steps on the scene and when that presence of the Lord really comes anything can happen and this lady Mary Magdalene she was delivered of her demons Jesus called her by name a name that nobody knew and then he quoted a scripture that that was dear to her heart and she just knew there was something special about this man and I think that all of us can have that same experience and it was powerful and when I was asking the kids we had a discussion afterwards and I said what was your favorite most of the the um the young people they said that it was the ending and it was a really powerful ending but let me tell you no matter how great a movie can be it can't even touch the true the real life when you truly meet Jesus Christ and you know that he's alive and you feel his power there is nothing in the world that can compare to it we can write books about it we can we can make movies about it but man when you really come into His presence and you see that he is real and you see that he is the same yesterday and today and forever there is something about that that it changes your entire life and that's what we want for everyone that comes into this church everyone that comes into contact with any of us we want them to know this living Jesus Christ we want all of us I want to know him I want to know him better than I know him he is so deep he's so wide he's he is so great the the the more I get to know him the more I read this book The more great the greater he gets he is just he is everything and if we can just lead just one soul to know him even just encourage someone we don't a lot of times people they they want to go out and witness and they want to have a Ministry and they they want to go go on the Evangelistic field to win these souls to Christ but you have to be careful that you're not just trying to get a trophy that you're not just trying to get someone that your name is attached to that you can say I led this person to Christ no no no if you can just represent Christ to that person I've got my you heard Bethany sing just now my sister-in-law we got Adam my brother with us we are Evans Family we're are four I'm the premere I'm the oldest I'm the first born then we have my brother Jeremy he lives in Jeffersonville right now and then Adam came third Adam also lives in Jeffersonville and then fourth came My Sister Laura and there's about nine diff nine years of difference between Laura and me so we were we were spread out in that time Adam is um I'd like to have Adam speak for a little bit and give us some testimony about what he's been doing you know we talk about the Lord a lot but James teaches us he says don't just be hearers of the word anybody can hear the word but be doers of the word and I wanted Adam to come up and and give some testimony about what he's doing I I mentioned this boxing gym that we started a few years ago and the success is there I want you to get some eyewitness accounts to what what's been going on lately and how Adam has really taking the taking the lead and and encouraging these these people that really they have no God in their lives and really many of them the only Jesus Christ that they have ever seen is in my brother Adam and and it's so important how he represents Christ to these young people Adam why don't you come on up and uh say as long as you want um and uh give us give us a report on on what's going on there thanks man do a good [Laughter] job well first of all I want to just say how special this group is I didn't really know uh me and Dan will talk usually about once a week and I'll say you know hey this what do you think about this I'm talking to the boxers this week and good good yeah man that in fact that's a little bit something like I'm talking about this week and we kind of share notes and go back and forth and he'll say you're not going to believe you know this congregation or uh this certain person that showed up and this is kind of how what led them here and and you hear it uh from a distance but it's different when you see it yeah amen it's you guys should be proud yes it's um you guys have a a real Daniel I'm saying you guys I I did if you were here Wednesday night you know what I'm talking about you brothers and sisters uh you really have something uh special happening here and and I appreciate it and I know my brother Daniel's a part but he's no bigger part than any of you all and it maybe it's hard to understand but but that's the truth I'm GNA raise this mic up not there you go so that being said you should you should be happy you should be uh proud of yourselves for for sure uh I wanted to give a quick history of you hear us talk about this gym and it's a it's an inner city boxing gym kind of how it come to to be I have two boys one of them's Daniel's age and one of them's a couple years younger and they were always very close coming up and they were just being teenage boys you know if you had teenage boys I don't need to explain anymore but if you haven't just pray for anybody with teenage boys so they were starting to be teenage boys and I I got my boys into boxing I said hey there's this boxing gym down there instead of punching holes in all our wall maybe they can you know hit a bag or you know hit each other and so they they kind of they caught onto it real quick and my brother Dan and I would talk and he's like yeah I want to get Daniel involved and so just matter of weeks Daniel was involved and we ended up at this this gym where the owner of the gym is a Christian he knew kind of where we come from he he kind of knew uh the Believers there in Jeffersonville and knew a lot of the same people and he said hey I want to do something for the Lord with this gym and he and I his name is Jeremy which ironically is our other brother's name is Jeremy but uh Jeremy the owner of the boxing gym he he says this and I said yeah let me talk to my brother I know my brother has a real gift in his life a a you guys see it he he really does he has a gift in his life to talk to people I said let me talk to Daniel and and let's let's come up with a plan so we did we got together um we had a big open house I don't know if any of you guys you guys know who Tim Witherspoon is you guys remember that boxer Tim Witherspoon he come down and kind of helped us open the gym and with Tim Witherspoon there and just rough crowd we preached to him and we started talking to talking about the Lord and we brought the Lord Jesus Christ into that gym and we started every week for 20 minutes maybe 15 minutes we would just talk to these young kids about the Lord talk about their life talk about how they can improve it talk what tell them what the Lord Jesus has done for us and just do a little bible study talk about the word and it um that's been six years ago it doesn't feel like it but it's been it's been six years ago and and it it hasn't stopped we just keep going and sometimes I'll get a little down I'll think man I'm not it's not making a difference um and it hurts you know it's like am I am I doing anything and what I always come back to is just show up show up and do something show up and mention the name of the Lord Jesus and it it changes people just these these young people they've never heard that name before tell you a quick story there's this young lady now um that's that's coming there her story she grew up very poor so we live in Louisville Kentucky area home of Muhammad Ali just saying um but there's some really poor areas and that's kind of the the kids that kind of come toward boxing you're usually generally poor well she was in that area and grew up poor and she was about 10 years old she started getting abused um by her uncle so it was just her and her mom and her uncle started abusing her and she she knew it was wrong she knew something bad was happening but she didn't really know how to EXP it so this went on for a while and she finally went to her mom and said Mom this is happening I need help and her mom was in a bad place also and her mom said well don't tell anybody because they'll put Uncle so and so in prison if you tell anybody and she let it continue and so this happens for year after year after year until her mom gets in trouble and her mom goes to prison and so now this young lady need needs somebody to raise her she's in her mid- teens at this time and she needs somebody to raise her and what does the court do gives her to her uncle and so now her uncle is Raising her the one that's causing her this abuse and things just seem very dark for her and it's terrible and she goes on until she finally gets the courage up one more time and she tells a friend this is what's going on and it took a lot of Courage for her to do this this young lady's she's strong she strong I admire her and her friend told her mom you know friend's mom and they called the police and the police come find evidence of this and they arrest the uncle so now she's this I'm condensing a lot of this time but now she's older maybe 17 18ish maybe 19 I'm not not really sure today she's 20 maybe I'm not sure but so she's on her own everybody that she's ever trusted has betrayed her she couldn't trust her mom she couldn't trust her uncle these people who were supposed to be taking care of her of her and loving her she's at rock bottom and she has a seizure she says how could life get any worse and randomly she has the seizure and they take her to the hospital they don't really know what caused the seizure but while she's in the hospital this nurse starts testifying to her she's like do you know do you have Jesus in your life and this young lady's name is Jordan and Jordan no you know I've heard of Jesus but I don't I don't really know and but it piqued her interest she said there's something about that that I liked and she was telling me this story she goes I don't know why but there was this this kind of Desire this thirst and said I need that I need what that nurse was talking about and so she goes on life she's waiting tables trying to make a living and there's this this man that frequented the restaurant and he was very kind to her and he started talking to her and she started telling him some of the problems and he says well I'm a minister minister of the Gospel I want to invite you to my church and she's like okay okay maybe maybe this is that and so she started going to the church and she's athletic girl and she at that same time she says I've always wanted to learn how to box and so she comes to the boxing gym this is where we meet and I'm there talking about Jesus and she's looking she says this nurse is telling about him then this man is a minister and now I'm going to this church now I go to boxing I believe this this is what I need in my life and she accepted the Lord Jesus Christ she's turned her life around she's going to school she's working she's going to law school um she's gonna I can tell you right now she's going to do something with her life and so let me ask you did did I did this ministry that we have at the boxing did did that change her was that it was that the no I I just being honest no it wasn't but it was part of it am and it was the part that I was supposed to do I wasn't supposed to do the other parts I can't do I'm telling you I can't do what my brother Daniel does I'm as far as I feel I'm not called to do that I don't I don't have a desire to do that but I can talk to these young men at the boxing gym and it's something I'm showing up I'm trying to do what I can do it's nothing compared to what my brother Daniel does but the Bible talks about if you if everybody wants to be the eye in the body who's going to do the hearing that's right you know and if everybody wants to do the be the ear like who's gonna who's gonna walk who's gon to talk who's gonna so we all have different roles to play but the point of me telling you her story and telling you this story about the gym is to say you have a role also you need to play offense sometimes I was talking to this young man here Juan last night sorry Juan I'm going to put you on the spot I was so impressed by him I can tell he's a he's a good young man and Juan is he's struggling with something in his personal life where he wants to he wants to live a certain way and be a certain way but there's people in his life that don't want him to do that and we were talking about it and Juan there's I'm just saying this from experience there's nothing that you can say that's going to change them but there's things that you can do that's going to change them amen okay amen we got time for an experiment I want to do a quick experiment do an experiment with you all right I'm going to give you some simple instructions and I want you to to do what I tell you to do okay this is this is a very easy little game there's no real tricks here there's one rule do what I tell you to do okay everybody want to play this game yes okay everybody take your finger and and give me a number one do a number one sign right here good good okay take this number one put it up in the air a little bit okay good very good take the number one and put it on top of your head good all right put it put it on your ear put it on uh your nose good um put it on your your chin whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what did I say what did I tell you to do why did 90% of you put it on your cheek you don't listen you watch amen amen and Juan your family they don't listen to you but believe me they're watching you and that action is far more more important than anything you can say okay and it's the word isn't in action it's action the doing of something amen that's what speaks to people so I'll take boxing here for a minute me and you could talk about boxing all night long does that make you a better boxer oh you got to do it yeah amen we can talk about Christianity and we should that's it's a good thing we should talk about it's like that's what we're into it's boxing it's cool who's the best fighter who's whatever that's good to talk about it doesn't make you a better boxer talking about being a Christian doesn't make you a better Christian do it it's action it's a practice get out there and do it it's I'll close on this brother he's he's better at this I'm gonna I'm not going to take his time our life if you can imagine your life is a giant billboard that's there for everybody to read and once you say you know what I'm a Christian that's the top of the billboard it says I am a Christian and I and that's blank it's fill in the blank I am a Christian and I yell at people in traffic okay uh guess what oh that's what Christians do I am a Christian and I scream at my parents for people who are reading your life Daniel that was humbling you're saying that my life maybe is the only Christ that these people will ever see if I am doing those things wow this is a Christian that's what Christians do I am a Christian and I yell at my parents okay that's what Christians do but I am a Christian and I love my neighbor amen I am a Christian and I serve others amen that's what we want that billboard to be right we we are that representation the Bible says you guys know what an epistle is it's like a a writing an epistle and it says our we are living Epistles we are living letters to people about Christ I am a Christian and I do this got it Jesus said this is to the church and I think you guys should be so proud of this Jesus said when I when they look he's talking to his disciples and he says when they look at you how are they going to know you're my disciples was the answer it's like well they don't drink that's how they know they're going to be my no no was it well they don't um they don't go and party at night that's how they're G no that's not what he said I'm not saying we should do those things we shouldn't but Jesus said how will they know that you are my disciples for your love for one another they're going to see you love each other that's how they know you're one of his so I'll leave you with that love each other be in action and fill out the rest of that sign I am a Christian and I it's up to you yeah thank you brothers and [Applause] sisters we're here so much we need Unity we all need to get along we just need to love one another brother there's going to come a point in time that we need to start really doing it and let me tell you it's not easy some people are easier to to love than other people but Jesus didn't qualify the easy ones to love in fact he said it's easy to love those that love you we need to love those that hate us I appreciate Adam because he is really he's putting it into action he's he's being a Christian we don't have a works-based Salvation we're not Catholic the Catholics see that they can work their themselves to Heaven by by saying so many Hail mares or or doing this that's not what we believe you can't work yourself to heaven but let me tell you you have to obey God's word and God's word says to do something and if you really believe God's word we are saved by the blood of Jesus Christ unmar Grace but if we really believe him then we're going to be up and doing our lives are going to be filled with action as Adam was telling me that story um oh oh uh could you put the picture up there real quick I want him to get a visual of this young lady there she is with another one of the boxers at the gym she's uh yeah a young lady who came from a very very difficult background a a background that uh is really horrible and not only is she serving God but God is blessing her and giving her education he's going to give her a career she's going to be successful remember there are blessings that come with serving God there's hardships that come with serving God but if you're an honest person if you're doing what Jesus said you're also going to be successful in life that I can guarantee if you're if if you live up to what you say people are going to want to hire you they're going to want to do business with you thank you um let's turn our Bibles as Adam was telling me the story I said you know there is a scripture that is exactly what you're saying let's turn our Bibles to Matthew chapter 23 remember for the kids last night we saw we were introduced to this guy Matthew and how he was really um really good at keeping numbers and all of that but I'll tell you what the guy was a total creep I mean he was dis honest he was stealing from the people he was hated but God changed his life around and this this one that we saw last night in the video this is the one that God chose to write one of his four gospels and the most comprehensive of all the gospels is the Book of Matthew Matthew chapter 23 now Jesus had just got done speaking to the Pharisees and Sadducees and giving them giving them Parables and then he turns his eyes from the priests and he looks out into the congregation into us just the normal people then spake Jesus to the multitude and to his disciples saying the scribes and the Pharisees they sit in Moses's seat they're here in the Pulpit judging the people and and preaching they sit in in Moses's seat all therefore whatsoever they bid you to observe whatever they tell you to do that observe and that do but do not ye after their works for they say and they do not what an example what an example of what brother Adam was saying is how many so-called Christians say that they are Christians and then yet they yet don't do it they're quick to give you their opinion and how you should live your life and and how you should make your decisions but those are the people what decisions are those people making in their own lives they're quick to tell you and they're quick to tell me well brother sister what are you doing in your own life you show me faith without works as James said and I will show you my faith by my works I will show you I don't have to tell you you just look at my life and you look and you see what I'm doing as Adam said they'll all talk about they'll talk about unity and they'll talk about forgiveness if you have a problem with somebody else they're quick to say sister Shirley you just you got to get over it you gota I'm I'm talking to the sweetest person in the entire building you got to get over that and you got to you just can't be dwelling on that and then what are these people doing somebody does them wrong and see how they react I'll tell you I'd want to take my advice from sister Shirley even if she's not willing to give it because she's walking the walk she's not just talking the talk she's walking the walk and she is the she is living this gospel verse number four for they bind heavy burdens and Grievous to be born and lay them on men's shoulders but they themselves will not move them one of their fingers these are the guys who are too good to get down and dirty they won't take out the trash in church but they surely want to be up in the Pulpit preaching they want to be in front of the people and when it comes to to the other things when we need help cleaning the floors or when we need help painting the walls or we need help these things well I got something better to do but you watch those people who are willing to do anything those are the ones that God really uses they're the ones that God really takes their Ministry and whether it be pressure washing the front porch and then God will use that person to lead a soul to to lead a soul to him but all their Works they do for to be seen of men they make broad their felties and enlarge the borders of their garment brother Ed or brother ly are the felties on the forehead or they on the arm yeah they're they're they're to they're something for show these are these are the prayers and and they make these things broad so everybody can be seen so they can be seen and they enlarge the borders of their garments and they love the uttermost rooms of at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues and the greetings in the market and to be called of men Rabbi Rabbi Pastor priest father but be ye not called Rabbi for one is your master even Christ and all ye are Brethren and call no man your father upon the Earth for one is your father Father which is in heaven I know we we laugh about it some of the people close to me because some of the homeless people around here they call me Father Daniel another one's call me Pastor you know it's like well it's it's F it's funny we we joke around but can you imagine really truly calling a man your father on Earth and putting that man in the place of God can you imagine doing that yet the priests are to this day called father that is in direct Defiance of this scripture right here and call no man your father upon the Earth not talking about your dad your Earthly dad but call no man your father the one that leads you no no there is one for there is there for one is your father which is in heaven neither be ye called Masters for one is your master even Christ but he that is greatest among you let him be your servant the very word servant is a derivative of the word serve and he that is greatest among you is the one that is serving you serving is an action serving is doing something and that's that is what a servant is that's what we're about is is Christianity is up and doing it's moving it's I I I have received the Lord Jesus Christ as my savior unmar Grace I Lord I I am so thankful that you have forgiven my sins and now I am showing that I am a Christian because I'm out in doing I'm leading souls to Christ I'm I'm in I'm I'm witnessing to people and not just that you might not be good at that that's okay lord it's my calling to be working here in the church to be serving these people Lord it is is whatever you want to call me to maybe it's to help other people maybe it's maybe it's for my donations what whatever it might be Lord I want to be in your plan and there's many different plans we all don't have to be up here in the pull pit preaching but we must be doing something if you say that you are in the body of Christ and I hope that we all say that we are then you have a purpose and you need to know what that purpose is otherwise you're not doing any good serving is doing something and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted see so many people say I'm serving God now we should say that I quit drinking I quit smoking quit lying quit cheating quit cussing and that's good you shouldn't do any of those things but that is not serving God that's not doing something when you say I'm serving God now it's not because you quit your old sins you should quit your old sins but that's not serving that's not doing something we went through Obadiah on Wednesday and the the the sin of the was watching their Brethren be conquered by an invading our army and doing nothing but standing back there and watching it happen if they would have least tried if they would at least tried to help God probably wouldn't have cursed them but he said you saw you just stood there and you watched your brethren from Israel you watch the invading Armies come in and you watch the invading armies destroy Israel and you didn't do anything about it therefore you're cursed brothers and sisters when we go before the Lord are we going to say Lord I quit lying quit cheating quit smoking quit quit doing all my drugs and quit quit doing all these things Lord I did it all for you and is the Lord going to look down upon us and say so what you're saying is you did nothing for me because quitting something is not doing something that's not doing something and when you quit something and we should youall know me we should we should quit all of our sins but when we quit something there's a there's something in our bodies there's something in our souls that that sin is taking up space whether it's sleeping around before you're married whether it's lying whether it's doing drugs whether it's gossiping there's something that sin whatever sin you have whatever in there when you get rid of that sin it creates a void there's a hole there now and that hole has to be filled up with something fill that hole up with the things of the Lord fill that hole up with serving the lord and then that hole is no longer a hole that space is taken the enemy can't get in there anywhere because there's no room for him and then when the Lord stand when the Lord there and as my little hypothetical scenario so what you're saying is you did nothing for me while you were on earth when I needed clothes you didn't give them to me sister Lois when I needed socks you didn't give give them to me when I was hungry you didn't feed me when I was thirsty you didn't give me a drink when I was sick you didn't come and pray for me when I was in prison you didn't visit me when the church needed help you didn't offer but you quit sinning so much but you still sin all sin and come short of the glory of God but in quitting these things what did it produce it should have produced a holy vessel that is now set aside and Sanctified for the service of God and what is the service of God just read it it's serving his people I remember when I resigned my position in Louisville to go into the ministry I remember my boss I was this up upand cominging kid I was I was uh I think I was 34 years old and and really just had the whole world in front of me and I had the opportunity as Adam did to to go into the ministry and serve the people there and I went into my boss's office and I said his name is Mark I said Mark it's time for me to leave the USGS it's time I I'm I'm leaving I'm taking another job and he stood up he says are you nuts he said do you know what you have here do you know what the future you have do you know where they're they're they're thinking of sending you do you do you know what's do you know what's your what's going on and he saidh he said you're going to make a million bucks aren't you he says you're you got a you got a high paying job and I said I said' Mark I said when I leave this earth and when I look back on my life I want to be able to say that I did something I want to be able to say that I accomplished something and the greatest thing that I could do would be to help change someone's life amen I mean I could come up with a new way to collect environmental data I could come up with a a new flow model that that shows the water flowing through the different caves in Kentucky I could do something like that and make some groundbreaking stuff but what good would that do really but just further science just a little bit more but what if I could really change one Soul one person what if I could like Adam's doing what could what if I could have an effect on just one person it's like taking a Stone you have a calm Pond you take a stone and you throw it out there in the water and it makes a big splash and those ripples go out and you change that one person then that one person he has a testimony now and he changes another person it might be his wife it might be his children and he is an influence on that person those ripples go out and pretty soon Adam you know what that spot that you threw the Rock in it's just it's just calm again that that is gone but those ripples from that impact they keep going and they keep going and that's what we have the opportunity to do is make a difference make a change make a change in our lives first and then make a change in others our children's and and our brothers and our sisters and and our parents and to to get past these sins and then make it worth our while to get past them and you say brother Daniel I got so much sin in my life I can't do anything I'm doing this and I'm doing this and I'm doing that and I've done this and I have I have these weaknesses and and I come from the streets I've got all these tattoos and I've I've got all this stop looking at Satan stop giving Satan credit for your life it's like you know what I am past that I have given my heart to the Lord Jesus Christ I am a different person that was the old me I had sin in my life and now I am moving forward and you know what I still fail I still mess up I still see all the problems within me but Lord I'm going to serve you you know it's in the Bible it's all over the place in the Bible but let me read to you something a great man Isaiah chapter 6 listen to this verse number one yes in the year that King Uzziah died I saw Isaiah speaking I saw also the Lord sitting upon the throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple in an experience with God above it stood the seraphim each one having six wings and with Twain he covered his face and with Twain he covered his feet and with Twain he did fly Bethany can you think that song you just sang I can feel that brush of angels wings and here is Isaiah he had that very same experience and one cried to another and said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke there a prophet he sees all of this Holiness around him he sees these angels and he he he he's in the presence of God and he says woe is me for I am undone he says I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of people with unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts I am a sinner is what the prophet Isaiah is saying and he doesn't list his his faults what he needs to give up or what he gave up but he probably said wow I've done this and I've done this I guarantee you he did I've done this and I send this very this very morning I did this and and last night I did this and and yesterday I was driving and I cut that guy off and I I shouldn't have done that no I'm not worthy and then I told a lie I told a lie I told a lie how can I handle the word of God and he said I am a man of unclean lips from mine eyes I've seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphim unto me having a coal a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this has touch thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thine sin is purged so this live coal touching the the lips of this man this sinful man purged away his sins what would that's a live call what would the blood of Jesus Christ do to any of us what would the filling of the holy spirit that was something different this is Jesus Christ himself the King of Kings the Lord of lords what if he would come down and dwell within me you're talking about purging my sins you're talking about making me holy he changed right there did he stop sinning no but something changed in this man Isaiah and he says I I'm not worthy but that Spirit came down and after this young man Isaiah he gives his heart to the Lord maybe he's baptized in the Holy Ghost he he goes up he's baptized in the waters of baptism he makes a change in his life he makes a commitment Lord I'm going to be different and then he hears a voice from Heaven this is this is cool this is really great this is this I love this part then he he hears a voice from Heaven the Lord the Lord had a job to do and it was a job for other people and this is a sinner he just said I'm a man of unclean lips I have all the sin in my life I'm doing all of this and and he gives his heart to the Lord and he hears the voice of the Lord cry out who shall I send and who shall go who shall go before us now this man that had all the sin and all of these things he says Lord here I am send me so who will go for us who will represent the Lord to those who need help Isaiah just saw how sinful he was he just saw all of his weaknesses and he says Lord send me I want to do it I want to help I want to do Lord whatever you would call me to do I want to do it I'm a sinful person but I had an experience with the Lord and I may not be worthy but I'm willing and it's a willing heart that God requires and all have as I said all have sinned and come short of the glory of God but there are a few people who are willing to take the opportunities that they're given and to make the most of what God allows them to do in all eternity we can't understand eternity it doesn't have a beginning and it doesn't have an end our minds don't think that way we think in time but in all of eternity there is just one short period that we call time the day you were born to the day that you die that's the only time that we have to serve God that's the only time that we have to make a difference and guess what everyone in this room I don't see anyone yeah everyone in this room that's breathing has that opportunity right now and we are living in that time book of James chapter 4 it says this verse number 13 go to now ye say that today or tomorrow we will go into a such a city and we will continue there a year and buy and sell and get gain so you're thinking about your career you're thinking about I'm getting rich I'm I'm going to go into this business I'm going to make a million dollars doing this but stop for a moment and let me let me just give you a life lesson all right that you can talk about it all you want you can talk about what you want to do you can call talk about something that you want to accomplish you can talk about being rich you can talk about all all of these things that you want to do but that has nothing that does absolutely nothing it takes hard work to get anywhere and if you really if you have a goal to be successful in in whatever way it is you got to work for it that is just the way of the world that we live in you got to work for it I saw Adam know he and Adam and I were we together and and and I saw Adam have get his mind set on doing something and I saw him going to night school I saw him taking classes when he wasn't at work I saw him working all the weekends and and and trying to put together this other career in his 40s a new career doing his best working struggling trying trying to come up with the money to pay for the school and then get his degree and then get a job a very very good job I saw him do it but you know what it took didn't take talking about it I've told Daniel before that you young people you can talk about it and talk about it and talk about it you may be 20 years old now then 21 22 pretty soon you're going to be 40 years old and you're going to be saying yeah I wanted to do this when I was a kid did but I didn't do it because you know why because you didn't do it because you didn't put your money where your mouth was you didn't put your your efforts into doing something and you just talked about it and the same thing goes with serving Christ you gotta do it you gotta you gotta step up and work for it verse number 14 whereas ye know not what shall be on the tomorrow for what is your life it is even a vapor that appear for a little time and then vanishes away you we've seen we don't see you see in Jeffersonville you see in the mornings there's this fog that comes down and you see it sometimes here like in in the cold when when there'll be a Mist above the grass from the humidity back East though there'll be a fog that's in the low-lying areas and then when the sun comes up it's completely gone and there's no more of a fog there there's no more of a Mist it's completely burned off and the sun shining and you look at it's like where did that go but while he was there it was watering the seeds that were laying on the surface of the ground it was providing moisture for for some of the plants that need moisture they get watered that way it was it was doing something but then it faded away and it was gone and the the the Apostle here is saying what is this our lives they're here and then they're gone and then there's nothing left of them for that you ought to say if the Lord will we shall live and do this or that never get ahead of the Lord and say I'm going to do this for the Lord as we were both saying before you find your position in Christ and then you move that way but now you rejoice in your boasting all such are evil therefore to him this is my point to him that knowth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin so you can cheat on your spouse and it's sin you can go out and get tanked up and it's sin you can go murder and it's sin and you can do nothing and it's still sin you cannot do what you know you should do and that is sin also you get to be to be man you can say hey I'm not so bad I'm not such a bad guy anymore I'm not doing the drugs anymore I'm not I'm not uh I'm not having sex out of wedlock anymore I'm not I'm not looking at at at the stuff on the internet I shouldn't look at I'm not doing all these things but you're you're still sinning because you're not doing what you know you should be doing Jesus said in Matthew chapter 10 he made this statement let me see if I can find the scripture he said yeah Matthew 10:37 he says this he said he that loveth a father loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me that's a pretty bold statement how many of us really live that life and how many of us are really aware of that and he that taketh not his cross and follow after me is not worthy of Me Jesus can you imagine carrying that cross down the streets of Jerusalem to his death look at all the people that were watching him walk by and doing nothing and how many people knew that this is wrong what's happening to that man and yet they did nothing I believe it was prophesied to be that way but in Obadiah and those they watched the Brethren and get massacred and they did nothing Jesus said no no no no you don't do nothing now you pick up your cross put it on your back just like I did and you carry it and and you win souls to Christ you talk to you you encourage your daughters you encourage your sons you help people you do things that you know are right or else it is sin are you with me take up your cross carry that cross and follow Christ oh close my favorite scripture and this one really is I say it pretty much whenever I'm preaching I was oh it's my favorite this one's really my favorite this is on my WhatsApp thing has as the scripture yeah see they knew I didn't say it Jeremy [Laughter] knew I cannot tell a lie it was in my notes I gave to him Romans 12:1 listen to this listen to this these beautiful words I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service God doesn't need you God doesn't need me but his people need us God uses us if we would just step forward he does not need us we need him but I'll tell you Brethren I need and sisters I need you I do I need your prayers I need your help we need each other and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God we want to be in that perfect will of God for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as God hath dealt to every man The Measure of Faith for as we let's just read the whole chapter we'll close with this this is this is great great these aren't my words these are the words of God for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many same Adam was quoting 1 Corinthians chapter 12 here it is again Romans chapter 12 so we being many are one body in Christ and everyone members one of another having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given unto given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of Faith or Ministry let us wait on our ministering or he that teacheth on teaching or he that exhorteth on exhortation he that giveth let him do with do it with Simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that showeth Mercy with cheerfulness all of these different parts of the body how beautiful let love be without dissimulation New International Version says love must be sincere abore that which is evil and cleave to that which is good be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love and honor preferring one another not SLO slothful in business you see coming to church is going to help you your career not slothful in business fervent in spirit serving the lord rejoicing in Hope patient in Tribulation continuing instant in prayer Distributing to the necessity of saints given to hospitality bless them which persecute you bless and curse not rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that do weep believe it's 1 Corinthians again chapter 12 I believe it's verse 26 says um just a second First Corinthians keep keep uh Romans up all right no 12:26 and whether one member suffers all the members suffer with it or one member be honored all the members Rejoice with it very similar back to Romans Rejoice verse number 15 Rejoice 12:15 Rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that do weep enter into their joy and enter into their suffering be of the same mind one toward another mind not the high things but condescend to Men of low estate be not wise in your own conceits recompense to no man evil for evil provide things honest in the sight of all men and if it be possible as much as lith in you live Peaceable with all men dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place under wrath for it is written vengeance is mine I will repay sayeth the Lord therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink in so doing Thou shalt Heap coals of fire on his head worship team can come close notice that you're not just turning another cheek Adam is working with these inner city people you're not just turning another cheek you are doing something sister Lois is handing out socks John and an are making themselves available to do whatever God has requiring brother John was here putting in base in the in the in the fellowship hall God bless brother John on thank you we're going to all benefit from it brother Joseph castellum back there he's witnessing he's helping his family

his wife sister Rachel a lot of times I don't know where she is a lot of times she doesn't get credit she's always helping she's always willing to to make food or to do something she's working in the back she's she's up and doing and the Apostle says here in verse 21 he says be not overcome with of evil don't be overcome in these things but you overcome evil with good you can do it be be doers of the word and not hear hearers only we realize our sins we repent of our sins and then what we have in common is that we are willing to clean the floors willing to be here willing to sweep up willing to to help sister Elizabeth bring people to church and pester the pastor if he forgets to do stuff that's part of [Music] it how beautiful and having that attitude like Isaiah did he said Lord I'm a man of unclean clean lips I have done all these things wrong I've got all this wrong with me uh but send me I want to go if you're with me Lord nothing can be against me Hebrews 11:32 it says and what
