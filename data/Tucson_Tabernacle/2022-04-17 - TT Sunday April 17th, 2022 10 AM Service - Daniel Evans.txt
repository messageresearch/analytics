my [Music] consecrate lord to thee take my life amen i don't just want them living in this around us i want them living in me amen amen live in me live in me lord we're going to do something maybe a little different this morning i'm going to say this i think the lord has blessed us as a congregation with wonderful ministry in our local assembly maybe we sometimes doesn't always be how we want it or it's not the person we want or it's not the meeting we want or the vote or the situation but the lord has fed us as a congregation locally and brother branham talks about co-pastors and i think these three men here on the the front these three brothers here and brother aaron have all fed the sheep in their way maybe not without a specific assignment or a vote or you know an authority specifically but in their humble sort of way they've they've fed the sheep and i think sometimes we can just be sometimes ungrateful and thankful what the lord has just given us and so this morning we're going to hear from all four of them this morning and we're just going to let the lord lead them and let us hear what what would we would have to hear amen so as we change the order of the service we're going to sing some songs throughout the service as well we're gonna just turn it over a little bit earlier to brother aaron to start off this morning let's stand and let's just sing that song again live in me lord live in me take my life and let it be amen as brother aaron comes live in me lord live in me take my life lord let it be consecrate me lord to thee take my life [Music] jesus i'm sorry live in me take my life [Music] lord to thee take my life [Music] lord to thee [Music] is he is lord he has risen from the dead and he is [Music] amen he is lord thank you sisters and there's going to be a little bit of movement because they're going to come back up to play but probably it'll be a little while so you can see them when we when we're praying on wednesday night's prayer meeting i just asking the lord something about sunday it's it's easter it's resurrection sunday just felt the lord just shared in my heart one's your four brothers take a portion and he'd share something that's in their hearts so we talked with him didn't have to twist a single arm they said yes that would be good so while we're standing let's take the first scripture and i know each one of us were kind of what are you going to miss john what are you going to minister on how are we going to overlap are we using the same scriptures and brother dan's said something that really had never thought of he said well mark and john and matthew and luke i wonder if they went to that what did you put in your book what did you write but no even if we heard it a hundred times it's still the same it's still the word of god so john 15 13. greater love hath no man than this that a man laid down his life for his friends how many are friend of god today he lay down his life for you you may be seated then brother dan asked and he said so what are you going to minister on brother the other ones were thinking it brother dan thought it out loud and i said we're going to talk about saturday a little bit there but the basis on this is god is love and everything he's done and does and will continue to do is motivated by love the greatest force that there is is love because it's not a destructive force it's a force that draws you back to god it's something that makes you where he says you can be like me and there's no competition in it there's no well i'm better than you no we all come under that same we're his bride as joseph when he put his bride aside and yet ministered to his brothers he didn't put one over the other and he looks at it the same way today but he says greater love hath no man that he lay down his life for his friends and you know looking at that and and saying brother branham says in the message and and this came brother jordan sent out a text the other day and he said i've been listening to this message shepherd of the sheepfold and he sent it out to us brothers that minister in all and part of the church here and we all got him and i began to listen to it and this really struck my heart right here if you would put that quote up there and then after he gets them all numbered and they're all bedded down the shepherd goes down by this hole where the sheep come in at and he lays himself down across that hole then no wolf can come in no thief can come in no harm can come in lest it come over that shepherd first that he would lay down his life for you and for me he says what a picture of christ laying himself down for us that nothing can harm us unless it comes over him now watch what he says here so if you're sick and you say brother branham sickness crossed over him but it was for the glory of god now that's the hard part at times how is god going to get glory over this he says that's right he wants to maybe give you a testimony as a fellow said one time he's seen a shepherd with he's packing a sheep and he said well had his leg all bandaged up and he said well what did you what's the matter did it fall off a cliff he said no i broke its leg oh he said you must be a cruel shepherd to break your own sheep's leg god why are you doing this to me why are you letting this happen to me why am i going through this today braham says there's going to be a testimony out of this there's going to be praise go to god there's also going to be something in your life that you're going to realize that he cares for you and you're going to be confident in him he's never failed me never let me down he says he said no the sheep wouldn't mind me so i had to break her leg in order to hold her pet her and love her and give her a little special food so that she would look would love me and follow me and so sometimes god has to do that to us let the doctor say oh it's all over nothing could be done and then god takes you up in his arm and pats you a little bit and says child of mine you don't know how i love you don't you know i'm the lord that healeth all thy diseases but lord i was taught the day of miracles i know you was but i just had to let this happen so i could show you your uh you're a little special favor now don't you love me just a little more now i'm going to let you get well did you ever have just come to you i have many times looking back sometimes you say oh that was god god had his hand in it all he never left me alone i was never a place where really when i thought i was alone but he was there now when you think about that and again you look at the scriptures greater love hath no man than this that he lay down his life for his friends john 3 14-17 as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up all the word up to verse 17 that whosoever believeth him should not perish but have eternal life and probably one of the most quoted scriptures maybe today for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son the one who he broke the one who he had scorched the one who he had whipped for you and for me you ever looked at it this way he was god's sheep and he said i'm going to do that he was god's son i'm going to do that to him in your place that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that through the world the world through him might be saved for one more one more scripture john 4 10. here in his love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins i would ask you today there's something going to happen to this church it's going to fall apart something's going to happen but would you be willing to be the one to take all of that to yourself to save this church brother branham talks about that man and i forget the country now but he took all the spears of the of the enemy but it rallied the troops that was our lord and savior jesus christ now to think about that and then saturday in between friday and sunday is saturday we get at the accounts in the bible quite a bit is written of those three days quite a bit of the scriptures talk about those three days because this was god's plan all along a plan of redemption a plan to draw people back his children back the same as he did when he came that's that last time or that time knowing what adam and eve had done it was not a surprise to him he didn't come down and said where are they he calls out adam adam word though but he knew where he was he knew what had happened it had all been in the back part of his mind i'm a redeemer i'm a savior i'm a healer i do all of this but how can i demonstrate that if there's nobody sick there's nobody lost if there's nobody hurting so he allowed it to be jesus is silent on saturday the woman have anointed his body and placed it in joseph's tomb the body of christ is as mute as a stone which guards it he spoke much on friday he will liberate the slaves of death on sunday but on saturday jesus is silent but understand this that's what from the outside it looked like because on saturday we know what he went and did on saturday when he went and he knocked on the where are those keys when you hear the voice of those saying hey that's the one that we were looking that's the wheel in the middle of the wheel he's going now and preparing all of this now and he says so is god he made himself heard on friday he tore the curtains of the temple open the graves of the dead rock the earth block the sun of the sky sacrifice the son of heaven earth heard much of god on friday nothing on saturday jesus is silent god is silent saturday is silent have you ever been on one of those saturdays yourself where you're wondering where is god i thought wasn't he supposed to wasn't this going to be our great redemption isn't this when he was going to overthrow the romans all these things that they had thought were going to happen but saturday it's quiet the tomb is still sealed nobody has seen him yet there was no testimony there's no sisters to run to the disciple and say we have seen him he has risen that's on saturday easter weekend discussions tend to skip saturday friday and sunday get all the the press the crucifixion and the resurrection command our thoughts don't ignore saturday because you have them too and that's after a saturday when all seems still when all seems lost and god comes to you that is the most precious time of your life silent saturday is the day between the struggle and the solution the question and the answer the offered prayer and the answered prayer saturday silence torments us is god angry did i disappoint him god knows jesus is in the tomb why doesn't he do something lord you know what i'm going through you know the mental struggles you know the physical struggles you know the hurts the loss of a loved one the somebody that turned their back on you something that has changed something has just gone completely different god where are you in this you read listen to brother branham's life story a man sent from god and he came to that exact place he said i'm driving down the road and satan's sitting on the seat next to me talking to me and telling me where is this god where is he now and he'd have to remind himself of that living god then why did that goiter fall off where did that healing come from where did this answer come from and he had to re-encourage himself your marriage is in a mess your life isn't a mess the things that you were promised or you seem to hope they just don't be coming that way the road to emmaus comes up about that time let's just go back to what we're doing where peter says well i'm just going to go back and start fishing again i know how to do that brother peter what brother john what i thought he said that he'd never leave us he'd never forsake us i'll be with you always he said where is he today listening to brother donnie reagan as he spoke in the meetings the youth services in in louisiana and he made a comment and made me stop to think a bit he said if brother branham was still alive today we'd be falling everywhere he is he's going to be in phoenix no sunday service here we're going to phoenix he's going to be over here and he made this come he goes how many message churches would there be established today or would we just be following him everywhere he went but jesus said i have a better way than this but it took his death it took his punishment for you and i in order to provide it and he also had to say not my will but thy will be done he had to come to that place where he humbled himself and said lord not my will but thy will be done sometimes that's the hard part lord i i've had my mind set on this i've had this i've wanted to do i've wanted to go this direction i thought this is how it would come out and god says are you willing to let it go are you willing to say hey i'm willing to do whatever you say lord see he knew the scripture said i will not leave his soul in hell neither will he he knew those scriptures and he said i've got to go to this in order for that to be fulfilled you're in the saturday of your life but sunday's coming the resurrection now there will be a physical resurrection there will be a complete change of this body when this mortal shall put on immortality and we look towards to that we look so much to that sometimes when we're in the middle of something hard something tough lord although it would happen today but god's got a reason and a place for it all then came the morning sunday the bible tells us our sisters had gone over to anoint the body after they had been told i would lay this life and in three days i will raise it back up nothing he had ever done had disappointed them because he had kept his word there wasn't that thing where they could say well you remember that one time he told us this but it didn't work out that way remember of those those bases that he told them fill them with water and they'd become wine but two of them didn't change there was never anything like that with god it's exactly what god said took place when he said lazarus come forth there was like okay hang on hang on i got to go pray some more no no he spoke in the beginning he said loosen they had seen it over and over and over but the one they had laid their hope all of this could i say the man's side the one they walked with the one that john laid his his head on their bus on his bosom the one that turned around and said peter feed my sheep he'd also told peter he said you're going to deny me and peter said no way but he also said on resurrection sunday and peter too so my brother my sister sometimes when you're feeling that way he'll call your name i'll say you too you're included on this so it's sunday morning what we call easter morning resurrection morning without a resurrection we might as well close up the church and go home because then there's no hope brother branham and and and when they played the the excerpt yesterday at the memorial the one we had spoken on a couple weeks before when brother branham crosses over to the other side was that part not true and the rest of the message is true oh that was the word of god being expressed to us down another glimpse of it hey we're going to go home it's going to be like this dad was coming in this morning i went out to help him come in i said how are you doing he said okay but my legs really hurts getting harder and harder to walk i go back in my mind i remember dead as far back as i can remember strong and healthy and always able to do whatever we had needed in fact if not too long ago you would tell them dad take it easy when you shake my hand because you will almost break my fingers but now i see them but you know what there's a promise there's a hope that is greater than hope there's a revelation that is set down in your heart and it's real and that's what's holding you that's what's keeping you sunday morning sunday morning we're going back to the tomb we're going to anoint his body we're going to have to deal with soldiers who's going to move roll the rock who's going to do this hey they were like us you know they were just like us how's this going to happen brother greene talks about flying with the with the um casket all the way back with his head to his ear to it saying waiting to hear brother brown said brother green open it up jesus didn't have to say i'm waiting for somebody to open the door no sir no sir he said let the stone be rolled away and it moved he walked out he's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever sunday morning and still they had trouble believing we have seen him the sisters come up we have seen him we talked to him and the scripture tell us they said no no no no you're confused he didn't on the road to emmaus all the way back home the very one that they were waiting for they had spent this time with is walking next to him and they don't recognize him and he begins to tell them everything that was in the scriptures and that's what he talked about i came to fulfill my father's commands the word says this as moses was if you had known moses you would have known who i am he's telling them everything he didn't vary from the scriptures that was his identification that was how we were going when he said let there be and that was god and there was light he had to believe his own word and there was light when he said thy faith has made thee whole and was no different it was him speaking they hadn't seen it all but now they're walking back and they're saying then he goes hey what are you guys talking about you guys look really disappointed discouraged man you know if you could walk any slower and look or dead you would be dead and they turn around and look at him how would you feel brother peter if i turn around look at you one day with his absent look at my face and said who are you you'd probably think i'm kidding but what if you realized i was serious how would that affect your heart brother aaron doesn't know me what's wrong with him this is what who are you where have you been don't you know what just happened and he's like yeah i was there i was honestly there in fact i was the main attraction if you could put it that way and they walk six hours with him and he begins to what tell him what this says all he ever did and they still don't realize it's him they come to that place where they're going to go to their home and he says well i'll just continue on they said you know there's something about you and i know you didn't you didn't see it you know but just you know come on and rest yourself sit with us for a little bit here and and then you can travel on and he says okay not like he didn't know this was going to happen but okay and when he begins to break the bread and their eyes become open he's alive he's alive it's him and he goes on oh that god would make it more surreal than it ever has been in you he's alive he never changes he's god the omnipotent who loved you in me more than anything else and then they go back and they tell the other disciples we have seen him and they're like thomas unless i see him unless i touch his wounds unless i i'm not going to believe it god called him o faithless thomas but he didn't say you're not one of us anymore he didn't throw him out said okay bring somebody else in because obviously thomas is not a believer how many would raise our hands and say there are times that oh lord i felt like a thomas i struggled through this but god rich in mercy said and peter too and called your name and said you're included in this no matter who right brother joe you too we all had our days like that we've all had our day and elijah in the old testament and i only me left to serve you lord nobody else god looks at him he said i got seven thousand elijah that haven't bowed their knees god knows each other thank god for saturday saturday is that time in your life that you're going to realize how much he cared for you even when you walk through that all day saturday wondering is he really god does he really keep his word is he really alive is this the truth or not and he comes to visit you and he says yes it is and you realize he still loves you he hasn't forgot you he knows your name he is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever brother jordan this could go on for a long time i want to give the brothers each a chance share what's in their heart you love the lord jesus is he jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever if you'll stand one more time before brother he is lord jordan for he is he [Music] is [Music] that jesus christ is [Music] he has risen from the dead and he is [Music] that jesus christ is as we turn the surface over to brother peter let's just sing white as snow white as snow though my sins were as scarlet wide as snow white as though my sins were as scarlet lord i know lord i know [Music] wonder of your love through faith in you i know that i can be [Music] amen god bless you all let's let's pray together oh god we're so thankful for this resurrection lord lord that you're alive and that that morning you're still speaking to us we need your voice in this age lord and so many are wandering in darkness lord let us just hold your hand and be led by your word father by your spirit we want to be alive with you this morning lord i pray father you blessed these next few minutes lord that be not i that speak with you lord and just keep my mouth or from speaking anything that's not your pure word anoint my lips in the ears of the here lord that we could be blessed in your presence father thank you in jesus wonderful name amen while you're standing let's go to genesis 1 11. thank you musicians i wanted to read a little bit from the first chapter of three of my favorite books so we'll we'll read from uh genesis 1 psalm 1 and revelation 1. all right genesis 1 11 try to i've got a lot so if you just pray for me and if you if you'll pull then should be less than 45 minutes and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so amen psalm 1 chapter 1 see every seed bringing forth after their kind in the beginning and then let's psalm 1 and 1 it says blessed is the man that walketh not in the counts of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season there's the key there those words in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper and revelation chapter 1 verse 4. we'll read and then and then you can be seated for a few minutes probably not enough time to to get a good nap but at least you can be seated revelation 1 chapter 4 [Laughter] all right um revelation 1 and we'll read 4 to 8. it says john to the 7 churches which are in asia grace be unto you in peace from him which is which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead that's the part i want to emphasize here and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us amen were therein and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever amen behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all the kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him even so amen i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending saith the lord which was which is which was which is to come the almighty amen you may be seated for a few minutes i've i've already used a third of my time so so help me out you know easter is one of the most glorious days there is and it's such a joyous day what a what a holiday that we can we can look and we call it easter and there's different theories about the that name but really it's resurrection sunday if i could call it you know resurrection sunday that's a better description than easter and we can look back and of all the stories in the bible this one is the most important you know there's there's calvary which in in some ways is more important in a lot of ways it's more important but if there was calvary [Music] and there was no resurrection then the apostle says it's all in vain there has to be this resurrection sunday for any of this to matter and this most important event is the most thoroughly vindicated with the most evidence for this even in the the the history of the church a lot of the the different um stories in the bible maybe there's questions that happened this way did it happen this way was it a parable was it did it really happen was it a fish was it a whale easter either jesus christ raised from the dead or he didn't and we have a number of apostles that each voted with their life they each gave the last full measure of devotion they said heroes it was real i'm a witness and then we've got all through history of the church these men these women these gallant souls that were so convinced that this was literally true that they would seal their testimony with their lives it's powerful and so this is a beautiful day but it's a day of sorrow if you're not a part of it jesus said because i live you live also if he came and he gave his life for you and he rose again that you could rise again that you could be part of this resurrection and you let that opportunity pass by what a sorrowful thing it'd be it'd be better had you never been born if you were to miss this so the question is am i part of this am i risen this morning am i alive and and a lot of times we we like peter we're looking at jesus we see his resurrection we see easter resurrection morning and we're so happy oh lord let me walk on the water with you and we start our christian walk and as we're walking we look to the left and we look to the right and we can get so discouraged look at myself and i know myself better than i know any of you and it's discouraging but maybe you'd look at yourself you'd also be discouraged a lot of things and i think really if you if you were to know all the all the inner workings of any of our hearts even somebody that you hold in very high esteem you could get discouraged you could say ah i thought we were part of this i thought we had this promise i thought we we had this word that if that same spirit that raised christ from the dead dwell in me it'll quicken my mortal body where is that why am i still so human why am i still so dead what's going on here right so that let me go back to genesis what is this dying and raising you can compare this to the parable jesus talks in parables he has this parable where these valuable talents are given to entrusted to different men and the foolish of the three is he who hides it in the ground and pulls it up again what more valuable thing is there in this world than the only begotten son of god so how do these line up how is this not just the foolish servant that hid this in the ground and pulled it up again there must be a difference right well of all the things that you can put in the ground you can put gold in the ground all sorts of different things there's only one thing that's not a total waste to put in the ground a seed god's plan for resurrection was never a single son to be raised but that there would be many sons brought to glory that he's the captain that he's like it says in revelation that he's the first begotten of the dead like it's talking about in psalms this this man this blessed man we read these these encouragements and psalms unfortunately so many of them are qualified on the man being righteous and i can never reach that in myself so a lot of times we try to read these as pertaining directly to ourselves it doesn't work but that's writing about christ he is that perfect man whose delight is in the law of the lord right he's that one and if we're in him then we do qualify through him see and it talks about him bringing forth his seed in season that's the way of seeds is that there's a season there's a time saturday night right even pre-dawn on sunday easter resurrection day if you were to go there and you'd open up the tomb you would be so discouraged this is the day this is the third day oh but there was a rising of the sun in the perfect time in god's appointed season and so is it with you and i church we've got a promise we've got a down payment we've got an earnest we've got that gift of a conscience that tells us when we need to repent it tells us when we need to go and make things right just like mary she received she saw this angel and she was told you're gonna receive this this christ it took about nine months it took time the law of the seed that's why we have good friday that's why we have saturday that's why we have this pre-dawn on resurrection sunday is because everything has a time everything there's a time and a season so don't be discouraged when you look at yourself look to calvary look and live keep your eyes fixed on jesus when we start to sink in the water his arm is there to hold us up righteous man falls seven times and rises again to this easter morning don't be discouraged when you look at yourself just look away to jesus and say i believe lord be it unto me according to your word i receive he's that corn of wheat that fell into the ground and died that would not abide alone but that it would bring forth much fruit so now this is the test in time not of you and i but it's the testing time of that seed that fell into the ground that if that was the real seed it will bring forth many fold god was not the foolish servant in the parable of the talent he knew what he was doing when he planted that seed at calvary he knew that though it would be bleak for a long time and though it would look like a failure that in his time he makes all things beautiful he's watching you and i amen oh i'm so happy he's the first fruits of them that slept it says it says in first corinthians 15 and 20 it says but now is christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept for since by man came death a man came also the resurrection of the dead for as an adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order there's a time for each of us some of us we'll go the way of the grave like our sister joyce some of us will be alive and remain but god has a time that each of us we're part of that resurrection but we don't have the full manifestation of that it says if that spirit that raised christ and the dead dwell in you it will quicken your mortal body we have part of that fulfilled part of that is to be fulfilled part of that we're waiting on part of that we've got this earnest expectation of the creature this creation that's groaning waiting for this manifestation of you and i proof that that seed was the real seed it's not approving of us it's approving of that seed and i believe that he was what he said he was i believe he was that corn of wheat that's going to bring forth that same life that same power that same dynamite this is not a gospel and word only but this is the gospel and power and manifestation of the holy ghost this is the the gospel that will raise the dead you know god it's the gospel to raise this dead man in the newness of life if i'll just hold to the promise amen i've i've used all my time but as we finish let's um i had a lot of other stuff you know arise shine thy light has come it's very soon we don't want to just say well you know that's someday this is the season this i believe is is this time that there's been a midnight cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him it says the virgins rose and they trim their lamps i believe that's the time we are there's a little more dying that we've got to do right when you trim your lamp you never end up more than you started you're cutting away of yourself you're cutting away the old burnt up parts that there can be a true light shine in this last stage that's the time we're living in it said he said if i be lifted up i'll draw all men to me that was him rising on on the cross and crucifixion we're to follow him we're just walking that same path if we're to share that same resurrection we share in in the same death that we deny ourselves we take up our cross daily and we follow him so we're looking to be risen with him let's not be discouraged but let's just say where can i trim my lamp where can i take up my cross where can i follow after him you know when jesus called the disciples he said follow me and of course okay yeah this this looks like fun after the crucifixion he says to peter second time now that you know where i'm going peter follow me will you follow him i'll go with him to the judgment no i'll go with him all the way but though it'd be dark weeping may endure for the night joy comes for the more in the morning if we'll if we'll not be weary in well-doing in due season we will reap if we faint not as uh as our musicians will come let's let's just finish in ephesians chapter five i just want to read this final encouragement to you ephesians 5 and we'll read 8-21 it says for you were sometimes darkness saturday freed on sunday morning but now are you light in the lord walk as children of the light of light for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and the truth proving what is acceptable unto the lord and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them let's trim those lamps for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret but all things that are approved and made manifest by the light for where whatsoever thou doest is manifest in light wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest let's let's be risen with him let's rise up let's wake up awake thou that sleepless arise from the dead and christ shall give thee life light see then that thou walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise redeeming the time for the days are evil wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is and be not drunk with wine where in his excess but be filled with the spirit that's a that's for you that's for you to fulfill say be it unto me i'll be filled with the spirit speaking to yourselves in psalms and him hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the lord giving thanks always in all things unto god and the father in the name of our lord jesus christ submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god god bless you church i pray you're encouraged and as a brother jordan will come and sing a song [Music] there's never been a day like this [Music] this oh there's never been a day like this [Music] been a day like this day i see there's never been a light that shines so bright as this day this glorious day as brother lyle comes once again oh there's never been a day like this [Music] this glorious day oh there's never been a day like this [Music] there's never been a life that shines so bright as this day this glorious [Music] day thank you he has risen such a day i i should sit down after what we've heard this morning i'm full i'm full our topic taken from the gospel accounts of easter is humility perhaps a little unusual well let's stand and you're already standing as you read the first verses this morning consider this question who was the greatest disciple on that easter day the 12 discussed and argued about who is the greatest throughout jesus ministry for example shortly after the experience we call the transfiguration matthew tells us at the same time came the disciples unto jesus saying who's the greatest in the kingdom of heaven well there's three of us and those other nine are down in the hill somewhere which one of us might it be these are real people they're just like us struggles competition right issues of trust how did jesus answer them jesus called a little child unto them and said him in the midst of them and said verily i say to you except you be converted guys you've got to change and become as little children you'll not even enter into the kingdom of heaven whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven please be seated we see from this scripture that humility is an important attribute of greatness in god's eyes a while later james and john the sons of zebedee came to jesus along with her mom according to matthew they wanted as much influence as they could get here why they were seeking an advantage and they were acting like little kids promise me you'll do what i ask before i ask okay did you ever try that one on your parents i did not very successfully mark relates the incident this way james and john the sons of zebedee jesus nicknamed them bernaderus the sons of thunder came unto jesus saying teacher we would that thou should just do for us whatever we shall desire say okay please no how about pretty please no no and and jesus said to them what do you guys want ask me first and then i'll tell you i wasn't born yesterday and james and john said to jesus grant unto us that we may sit one on that right hand one on the left we'll sort out which is which a little later when you enter thy glory we want the best seats in the house we want recognition we want power we're your guys it's not pete and those other guys down there well are you ready for a shock verse 41 when the ten heard it they began to be much displeased with james and john okay not a shock right they're real people they're just like you and me certainly they're like me later jesus is talking about greatness and he talks about how to achieve it matthew tells us but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant your attendant your waiter and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased he that shall humble himself shall be exalted well did the disciples learn the lesson jesus repeated it several times he said it over and over and over well let's look at their final meal together they've been together for some three plus years they're observing the passover very solemn time celebrating redemption released from slavery in egypt at a time we call the last supper jesus had told him i've desired with a great desire to have this meal with you and as he's with them he's just disclosed to them that he's being betrayed what a sober moment when they heard that were they thinking of jesus were they thinking of the implications of what he had just told them well let's listen in this time we'll let luke give us the details it says and jesus took bread and gave thanks and break it and it was monsters it was passover he broke the bread at says as we just heard it wasn't tearing a loaf of bread he broke bread i kept it in a plastic bag i don't want crumbs on the pulpit right and he'd break it and gave unto the gathered disciples he said this is my body which is given for you this do in remembrance of me we're remembering egypt do it now in remembrance of me and likewise the cup also after supper was the third of the four cups the cup of redemption he said this cup is the new testament in my blood which is shed for you but behold the hand of him that betrays me is with me on the table truly the son of man goes as it was determined but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed and they looked at each other began to inquire among themselves which of them that would do this thing well this discussion eventually subsides well what's the next hot topic that they discuss at this last supper we read in john several chapters of of his final words and instructions to these people he had spent the last years of his life with instructing and teaching and demonstrating but i wonder if they were really paying attention that night because the very next verse in luke when jesus has just shocked them after he's told them how desperately he longed to be with them what do they do there was also a strife an argument among them they fought about which of them should be accounted the greatest these guys never gave up each wanting to be the one in charge of the rest so given all this who do you think had one of the greatest honors ever bestowed on any of the disciples on any human being in human history for that matter let's consider these disciples for for just a moment their background their context of all this the celebration of passover is related to moses the mightiest prophet that had ever lived with a mighty arm astonishing miracles he took them out of slavery defeated the biggest army on the planet and brought them the word and not just spoke it he was the first one that wrote it he wrote it in great detail they had they had thus saith the lord they had the word they had it god spoke to him lip to ear for the next 1500 years people spent their lives studying every word that was written talk about using quotes in a sermon these guys had it down to a science they didn't have ipads and things to refer to they had it all so when jesus called his students his disciples who did he call the rabbis the priests the ones who had immersed themselves in the word of god no he called fishermen revolutionaries collaborators with the roman occupiers men who we see later are attempting tricks arguing trying to get the most prestigious assignments the highest honor in other words people like you like me and these people these guys they were overlooking the very example of humility that jesus lived before them every day for years if the resurrection were to happen today who do you think would see it first who would report it well let's look to easter for an example it wasn't peter no you remember he's what blessed art thou simon barjona flesh and blood has to reveal this to you but my father which is heaven on this rock of revelation you've got it peter no no it wasn't peter in fact he's the example of pride that comes before the fall he told jesus that night i'd die for you and a few hours later he was denying he even knew him no and it wasn't james or john the other two that were present at the transfiguration who was the greatest who would you have picked who would you have picked to be the first witness to the greatest event known to have happened in all of human history it wasn't even one of jesus hand-picked twelve but it was a special disciple nonetheless one that had been possessed of seven demons mary magdalene we read in luke it came to pass afterward this is early in jesus ministry jesus went throughout every city and village preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of god the 12 were with him and certain women were also with him these women had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities they were just like us they were broken mary called magdalen out of whom went seven devils seven evil spirits joanna the wife of whoso herod steward susannah many others which ministered unto him of their substance we see jesus ministry receive support from these women and that they had all received healing or deliverance through that ministry now mary magdalene wasn't just present during his ministry she was present at the crucifixion we read in the gospel of mark there were also women looking on afar off among whom was mary magdalene mary the mother of james the less and moses and solomay who also when he was in galilee followed him ministered unto him and many other women which came up with him unto jerusalem well that easter morning john relates that she was the first to go to the tomb alone before sunrise john 20 verse 1 we read the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene early when it was yet dark under the sepulcher and and sees the stone taken away from this replica here's mary she's alone this is a city that's crowded with pilgrims there's thousands upon thousands of extra people just packing the place so you can be sure there were pickpockets and other people that were looking for opportunities and here's this woman in the dark before dawn by herself venturing outside the city why she doesn't have anointing spices with her she has nothing with her she has no one with her maybe she's wondering is it true is it true but she sees that stone rolled away and what happens well she kind of carefully saunters away no no she runs comes to simon peter and and to john and says to them they've taken away the lure the the stone's been displaced what's going on we don't know where they've laid him she doesn't know yet that he's risen maybe some of the soldiers guarding the tomb stole the body or what's going on she seeks help so peter therefore went forth and and that other disciple john and they came to the sepulcher now up to this point no one had gone inside we have no information how mary peter and john got past the guards we don't even know if the guards were close enough to have noticed that the stone had moved it was dark but it's the sort of darkness that exists under a full moon i was up about three this morning and outside looking at the light from the moon don't ask me why but perhaps this day it was cloudy maybe mary and the two men carry a lamp or something we don't know but it says they both ran together oh they're charging down and here's poor mary running what's going on what's going on and john outran peter got there first and john stooping down and looking in saw the linen clothes lying but he didn't go inside then simon peter followed him and he went into the sepulcher and sees the linen clothes lying and the next few verses tell us that that they saw the grave clothes they saw the linen they sold the nap they didn't see jesus they didn't see a body they didn't see angels they didn't see anything like that so what happened they left they went back but john tells us that mary was the first to the tomb but mark tells us that she was the first to see the risen jesus in mark 16 9 we read now when jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils seven devils well let's go back to john again let's get some details we'll pick up right where we left off where where peter and john had left the tomb and left mary behind john 20 11 says mary stood outside the sepulcher crying a lot of help peter and john were they ran ahead of her to the tomb now they left her vulnerable by herself and as she wept in her grief she stooped down she looked into the sepulcher and saw two angels in white sitting one at the head other at the feet where the body of jesus had laid how did these guys get there how did they get past mary she was just outside the door the whole time and they said to her woman why are you crying she didn't scream she didn't ask them how they snuck past her to get inside every other time almost in the bible when an angel appears to somebody they're afraid and the first thing the angels say is fear not she's too distraught she's too upset she's too whatever she's not frightened they don't have to say fear not they don't have to say that they get right to the heart of the matter you're so sad this is the greatest day of the year that's ever happened why are you so sad why are you crying and mary says to them they've taken away my lord i i don't know where they've laid him and when she said this she turned herself back and saw jesus standing she didn't recognize him she didn't know it was jesus and jesus says to the same thing the angel said woman why are you crying are you looking for someone she thinking maybe he's the gardener she said unto him sir if if you've taken him tell me where you put him and i'll go get him and what happens jesus says to her oh mary she turned herself and looked at him and she said it says she says my teacher she didn't say rabonai she didn't say my teacher no no she says rabona my master not just master my master my teacher didn't jesus say my sheep know my voice they come when i call he called her name jesus said to her don't touch me mary i'm not yet ascended to my father but go to my brethren jesus is giving her a commandment giving her instruction go to my brethren and say to them i ascend to my father and to your father to my god and to your god and now we get to the heart of the matter for our brief lesson this morning the risen jesus has given mary a directive she has thus saith the lord to tell the other disciples so mary magdalene obediently excitedly joyfully came and told the disciples i've seen the lord and he had spoken these things unto her as a faithful witness excited to share not just good news wonderful news incredible news mark tells us how her testimony was received go to mark 16 verse 10 she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and wept and they when they had heard from mary magdalene that that jesus was alive and had been seen of her oh mary you're crazy no john my says they believe not john my said look mary calm down peter and i were there it's just an empty tomb with some grave clothes inside there's no angels there we were we were there there are soldiers outside not a gardener you're beside yourself mary just just calm down one of the others might have said have a cup of tea dear it'll settle your nerves we can imagine the conversations that they might have had luke tells us that to the eleven along with the others gathered there that that this and other testimonies seemed as idle tales you're just making this up yet mary magdalene was the first to see jesus and was a faithful witness to the incredible encounter she had she'd been with the disciples for years walked the same dusty galilean roads with them had endured the same ridicule and undoubtedly gossip though there's that traveling with those guys she'd helped with financial support in spite of all this they didn't believe her she wasn't a contender certainly in their eyes for the greatest disciple on that easter morning surely jesus would have appeared and spoken to peter or john when they were at the tomb but our subject this morning is humility as a lesson from the easter experience so let's see what happens shortly after her testimony and the supporting testimony of other women who had arrived after that first encounter we'll skip to verse 14 as we close mark 16 14 afterward jesus appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat and jesus upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen jesus upbraided his disciples for their unbelief he said they were hard-hearted now upbraided so where you can just read that right it's king james english bread yeah he just scolded him a little bit no no the greek word means to defame to rail at to chide to taunt cast in their teeth reproach revile afraid jesus was not very happy with these guys but are you ready for the very next verse up until now marcus told us the context and said this is the stuff that jesus scolded them right but now he goes to repeating jesus very next words and he said to them go he into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature now he's commanded them to be witnesses just like he commanded mary outside the tomb the disciples had just heard a true and faithful witness a humble witness and they'd rejected her testimony jesus is saying see now it's your turn a reliable witness one you knew for years told you the truth she had thus saith the lord but you weren't prepared to hear it even though i told you many times at the event you refused to believe was going to happen i even told you that day it would happen and yet you rejected it so now you know how easy it is for someone to reject the truth armed with this experience i'm now sending you out into the world to be my witnesses just like i sent mary to you and now you'll be able to better understand when your witness is rejected the disciples had just received a very personal object lesson they would be scorned and rejected by many just as mary one of their own had been by them looked down upon ridiculed even we must be very very careful both to tell and to listen not to be discouraged when our witness is rejected or even scorned jesus reveals himself as he chooses to whom he chooses and through whom he chooses we must be careful that we're not too proud to receive truth from god by whatever humble means he may use to send it humility like that of jesus god bless you amen let's stand this morning daniel will come sing let your word be born in the manger of my heart amen let your word be born in the manger of my heart let it live in me let it start live inside this house of clay and mold me every day let your work be born in the manger of my heart it was a tiny simple stable all battered and warm hardly a place for a king to be born he didn't choose someplace special to reveal his majesty so i know if i'll give him control he'll be born in in the manger of my heart [Music] live inside this house of clay and mold me every day let your word [Music] well outwardly i'm nothing not much to behold hardly a place for his word to unfold but if i'll just yield my vessel and let him have his way from glory to unto glory he'll change me day by day [Music] live inside this house [Music] god bless you all i i don't have a scripture to to start out with i'll be reading a lot of them so you can go ahead and take your seats i thought the brothers did an absolutely outstanding job to this point brother aaron you really blessed me and what you said very very encouraging and and talking about saturday and applying these days to our lives very very very nice and brother peter i think that i'll never forget what you said god's plan was not for a single son to be raised but for many of us to be raised god bless you just just beautiful and and i really appreciate brother lyle and talking about um mary magdalene and if the lord's willing i'll talk a little bit about mary coming up i uh and following that i i was a bit nervous when i got up and and i got up to come into the minister's office and i walked into the closet right there so so have have patience with me was thinking if i would have got stuck in there i would have had to come out sometime but the word tells us to go into our closet and pray so i uh i'm i i'm not gonna hopefully do that again um you know today it is it's the celebration of really what is the greatest day in history and as the brothers have have laid the foundation that's why we're here and there's hundreds of millions of people today celebrating this same uh resurrection day that we are celebrating when we were driving here we saw a tent meeting over i think it was on miracle mile there with with uh a group of people and they were celebrating and you see the the churches the parking lots were filled up on this easter sunday and and as we were driving here i i was thinking i was thinking how many of these hundreds literally hundreds of millions of people that celebrate this greatest day in christianity how many people have this resurrection this resurrection experience this resurrection in their daily lives and it doesn't just affect their easter morning where we all we all get dressed in our in our best clothes on easter and and we get our families together and we we think on the resurrection of the lord but does it affect our daily lives this resurrection i have to i have to uh i'll tell another one on myself i was had a rough week at work and i was just down and some things happened that some of them were in my control and some of them weren't and i was worried about him and i was just worrying myself sick about some of the these these events that had happened in work and and then i was i was trying but aaron had mentioned that that i might be saying speaking on sunday morning so i started trying to put together some things to say and and and one of those things that i was thinking of is this resurrection this experience that happens and having this faith and i was i was starting to write down my notes and then i was worrying about work and writing down my notes and worrying about work and i said lord i'm doing exactly what i want to preach to the people not to do don't worry about all these things that are happening it may be work it may be our health it may be our children it may be a brother and it may be a sister but there is a resurrected jesus christ and he resurrected on this day 2000 years ago and that needs to be in our daily thoughts we need to always be thinking of that and that is a christian i say what man in this bible or what man have you ever met what pastor what prophet what preacher could ever say i'll lay my life down and i take it up again no one has ever said so such words in the history of man except for one man i think of sister douglas i was so blessed yesterday with uh as brother edd called it the celebration of life and it was it was really a blessing to be there and to hear um these these testimonies about our sister and what a christian that she was but even sister dougal even in this position that she is in right now on this sunday morning in the presence of the almighty god even she can't say that i will take my life back up again that was for one man that was for the man christ jesus and he is the reason for easter today i uh i wanted to read this scripture and brother aaron has already read it and it is a scripture that's probably read more than any other scripture in the history of this book and it's it's the very foundation of christianity and uh i can see sister angela's turning to john 3 16. i would guess um a powerful powerful scripture and it's probably the first one that we all memorize and it is but it talks about the very foundation of what we believe and even in the beginning of jesus's ministry john chapter 3 he is already speaking of his death he's already speaking of this resurrection that's going to happen this this death dying for all of mankind and then being raised again let's turn there if you would to john chapter 3 verse 16. oh yeah do you all drink out of this yet i'm just kidding john chapter chapter 3 verse 16. for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life if this book had just one sentence in it that would be enough for me just those one words just that one sentence that's written there what it means to me and what it means to every single christian but i want to tell you something brother aaron read it earlier there's a john 3 17 and it says this for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved god sent not his son to condemn the world now i want to bring this book right back down to us jesus promised gave us the promise in acts 2 38 239 that that if we are baptized that we have the promise to receive the holy spirit that holy spirit is the spirit of christ living in us it's it's something that we cannot speak enough about it is it is the greatest thing that we could ever achieve is to receive this holy spirit because we have that spirit of christ and let me read this again for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world friends there is no condemnation in a christian as we have the spirit of christ we are not pointing fingers at each other we are not criticizing one another and if we do that that is not the spirit of christ that is the spirit of the other one this man called satan the spirit called satan this accuser that's his spirit so we need to be very very careful there and and since this this scripture is brought up so often i wanted to read it on this easter morning and and encourage us to do as jesus did and to have the same spirit that jesus had this lamb of god that took away the sins of the world on the cross the one that died on the cross and laid in the grave for three days was resurrected as i said by his own hand and who could say i lay down my life and i raise it up again only jesus christ let's turn to john chapter 10. verse 15. thank you my brother as the father knoweth me even so know i the father and i lay down my life for the sheep brother aaron i think it was you that was talking about the shepherd laying laying in the gate of the sheepfold it's a pen and this shepherd lays here in the gate so nothing can come in and out except it goes by the shepherd and jesus said i lay down my life for those that and there's you know that that's that is a wonderful aspect that's bravery that's that's compassion for one another but any of us could lay our lives down for one another we could lay our lives down for a cause as the as the the soldiers in ukraine and the people in ukraine are doing now they're laying down their lives for this cause of freedom that they that they have um brother aaron mentioned on winklart this morning the the swiss hero he laid down his life for switzerland this jesus laid his life down for us but he did something much more than that none of us could do as i said before what i'm about to read verse 16 and other sheep i have which are not of this fold them also i must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one shepherd no catholic no baptist no tapes only no fivefold no seven thunders no return ministry did i get everybody none of that one shepherd and one fault so so much so we're better than everybody else so much so much for a worthy elite we're we're much better than this other group oh we just know much more than they it is one god one jesus christ that saves us and only him now if we know more and we have been given a profit to reveal many of these mysteries that that have troubled us for so long then we're responsible for more but it does not make us any better friends not one bit there is one shepherd and we are celebrating his resurrection this morning verse 17. therefore doth my father love me because i lay down my life that i might take it again no man taketh it from me but i lay it down myself i love that part you know we we talk about we blame the jews and we blame pilate and they played a role but jesus said it's my choice i go to this cross willingly i lay it down myself i have the power to lay it down and i have the power to take it again this commandment have i received of my father and friends and i'm worried about work you know and i'm worried about um this architect that's trying to build my get my house drawn driving me crazy and i'm worried about those things and i'm worried about the cost of construction and i'm worried about how everything's going to go this week and i forget about the resurrection of jesus christ this man that said i lay down my life and i take it up again and not only ours but brother peter not only his but brother peter hours too sister dougals too and those and my mom and my dad and those that have gone on jesus has the power to to pluck them out i i mentioned i uh if you weren't here last time i preached i preached about rats swimming around in a bucket and uh what happened was these rats were saved there was an experiment done these rats were saved and then once they were saved then they realized that they had hope to be saved and that's what this gives me this man jesus being raised from the dead is the greatest it's the greatest revelation that we could have you know we we look at the seven seals tremendous revelation the seven thunders the church ages the third poll the the the tent meeting there would be none of those if it was not for this resurrection it would not mean as much those are wonderful aspects of our lord jesus and and my wife was asking me the other day she said we were talking about the seals and and some of these deeper teachings and and stephanie was she loved them and we were kind of rejoicing over them and and then we started to kind of place them and and she said i i don't necessarily understand the importance of them and i felt the same and many times i don't understand the importance of these tremendous revelations that we've been given but i believe the lord gave me the right answer because i was also wondering and these are little pieces of our lord jesus that he reveals to us it's it's a husband and a wife and and we we tell each other these little secrets that we have of each other you know oh when i was a kid i did this or or this is this is this part about me and and i love to hear that about my wife and i love to hear little things that she did as a little girl or when she was growing up and those are aspects in the carnal nature but these aspects in the spiritual nature these seven seals these seven last thunders these great things that the bridegroom is giving to the bride just tell me this is about me this is this is a little thing that you may not know i'm going to send my messenger down here to to tell you about these things so that you might know a little bit more about me but it is all about the lord jesus every bit of it is about the lord jesus first corinthians chapter 2. paul says this paul says and i brethren when i came to you came not with the excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god for i determined not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified paul is saying listen i know all these things he said he said that he has all of this knowledge so much so i believe it was paul that said that that i would be lifted up if it was enough for this thorn thorn in my flesh i would be lifted up beyond measure with revelation but even paul here says he says that i came to you and not in excellency of speech but i for i determined not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified paul's saying all of these things i don't know anything but jesus i don't know anything but this this this cross and this resurrection and i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in the demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god paul is saying that these things that we know that these revelations that that we need to be careful that a man can come up here with all the eloquence of of an archangel and and a man could come up here with all of the revelation and be able to preach it and to keep our attention and be entertained entertaining and to have all these things paul's saying be careful be careful because if it gets off of christ you don't want to go there friends the resurrection of jesus christ really does as it were separate the men from the boys it is everything to us we um as i said that that we're here on this special day and if i could do anything i would want this resurrection to stand strong in your hearts not on easter morning but on every single day don't forget christ took up his life again he was dead he died he died and he was put in the grave and after three days he rose again and these brothers were talking about some of the events that happened and i can imagine these disciples i can imagine say it was it was friday and they were thinking of this week that it just happened jesus rode in on sunday on palm sunday the week before jesus rode rode into this city as a triumphant king and people were waving the palm branches and they were throwing their clothes in the way and they were saying blessed be this man hosanna to the son of david and the disciples were like yes you know yes this is the messiah we've been with him the whole time he has he's done this and he's he's healed the sick and he's forgiven the sinner things are going good and he comes in he rides in and we know other people took notice of him writing in and then on tuesday or on monday the next day jesus is walking along and he's hungry and he sees this fig tree he curses it says and it doesn't have any figs on it it wasn't even the time for figs brother peter but he said you're cursed and he goes on and then he goes into the temple and and he sees all the sin that's in the church and he goes in and he sees them selling the the sacrifices and the and the money changes he takes the the tables he turns them over and he grabs the the whips and he says get out of here and they all go running and the disciples like man this is getting intense this is really he's he's it he is the king he's going to set on the throne and they're going they continue on and this week is just building in intensity and then on tuesday they're walking along and the disciples look up he's like whoa look at that fig tree remember what he said yesterday it's dead today the things withered and dying this man this power that's in the man he just keeps proving it to us over and over again and then in in saint john chapter 12 verse 27 my brother if you could put that up jesus starts talking to them and he says this he says now my is my heart my soul troubled and what shall i say father save me from this hour but for this hour i but for this cause i came under this hour jesus is again foretelling his death he's saying pretty soon i'm going to be on this cross and and i i won't i won't go through because of lack of time but then on wednesday and brother lyle very special lady on wednesday jesus is invited to this house of this man named simon and and he comes in his dirty feet and this lady knows that he's going to be there and she goes and she spends all of her money on this alabaster box of oil now she was a sinner the bible says many many takes is that she was a prostitute and she takes this oil and she sees the lord jesus there and there's just something about him this man gave her hope to be saved to be forgiven of her sins she takes the oil she pours it on his head anoints his head and then she must have just been overwhelmed and she just falls down at his feet and she just starts thanking him and crying and she's there and everybody's looking at the lord jesus like all right we know who this girl is and she's just crying and she probably gets embarrassed and she takes her she takes her her hair and jesus's feet has her tears on him she wipes it off and then jesus says this i do want to read this scripture oh matthew 26 my brother if you could put that up and they questioned him on it it didn't sit well with judas and they questioned him on it and and they said this they were uh they were upset this money could have been used to to feed the poor jesus says this for ye have the poor always with you but me you have not always for in that she hath poured this ointment on my body she did it for my burial again prophesying of his death this is really really cool by the way verily i say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world there shall also this that this woman hath done be told for a memorial to her this day that prophecy is fulfilled as i tell that story and it's been told millions of times throughout history with elias she was a very special lady this mary of bethany i'm not 100 positive it was the same as mary magdalene or not but we know that she was a tremendous lady and i'm running out of time so i'm going to go all the way to my to the end here and where were we at i think we're out wednesday and then on thursday the lord jesus gets his disciples together and they come together and he brings them in and he washes their feet and he has this last supper and as brother lyle said he broke the bread and he gave it to the disciples and they still they didn't know what was going on and as they were eating jesus starts saying some very odd things to them he said odd things through his whole ministry he says this in chapter 14 verse 6. john chapter 14 verse 6. jesus said unto them i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh to the father but by me not moses not elijah not brother branham not your pastor not your mom not your dad but the lord jesus go down to verse 16 and he says this he says i pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever they didn't know what he was talking about he was talking about the holy spirit and then in verse 27 he says peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid and then in chapter 15 he he commands them to love one another these things i've spoken unto you in verse 11 i'm sorry john 15 11 these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full this is my commandment that you love one another as i have loved you greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends but he commands this is my commandment that you love one another as brother aaron also touched on earlier and then friends right after that he went to the cross he's crucified and then on saturday he he was put in the grave on friday evening and then on saturday all was lost it was a terrible day it was probably the longest day in history i'll bet you it was even longer than when joshua was fighting um and he made the sun stand still it was a long day because everything that they had believed in was not true they thought how could this man be the messiah and die he was a great prophet we know that but all was lost and then saturday comes to an end they're afraid they're in one place they're afraid of the romans they're afraid of the jews they don't know what to do they messed up their whole lives and following this message this message of jesus christ it can't be true it can't be true because there's all of these so-called mistakes in it there's all of these so-called problems in it and jesus didn't fulfill all these but he did they just didn't understand it and then as as brother lyle said mary comes the most humble of all of them probably comes to the tomb and it gets worse on sunday morning it actually gets worse they're gone the body's gone now she can't even go and pay her respects now they don't even have a place to mark his grave this great prophet it was worse and then she goes and she tells the other the other folks and then peter and john as we know they come and then mary's over here and she's she's crying and she's just so upset peter and john come to the tomb they don't see anything they leave the angels say something to the other sisters that were there they left they they left excited mary didn't know any of this and she's so upset and then there's a man he says why are you crying what's wrong remember what i said about the resurrection it should always be in our hearts and how it's just so hard and these simple things like my job but god knows god knows these things these simple things like our children god knows you think he doesn't care he cares about the sparrow that falls from the sky he knows about our kids he knows about our lives he knows about our sickness he knows about those things but there has to be a resurrection there has to be that that in our lives every day it has to be here and then as brother lyle said he says mary oh god oh oh it's you what what is going on how could this be i thought i was wrong and i thought all of this i thought we were completely out of the lord's will we saw all these things going wrong in our lives it could be whatever it is we saw all these things going wrong and all of a sudden no everything was right you lost your faith you didn't believe but it's okay i'm here it's me and then we see that it's the lord jesus and he's here that's what the resurrection means and it should be always with us friends and if this resurrection story is true sisters if you could come to the to the your instruments if this resurrection story is true and we're christians we're here today so we believe it it should be part of our everyday lives that resurrected lord jesus should be part of everything that we do you know brother jordan i'm gonna i'm gonna take a little uh left turn i thought brother ed did such a nice job yesterday in the memorial brother ed would you come would you come up and and come to the pulpit and uh i want brother ed to close in a couple songs if you would come up with that come on up if we think about this resurrection story if we think about these things that happen to mary and as the brothers have said if they are real then friends we need to grab a hold of them there's there's like i said there's hundreds of millions of people come on out brother ed i'm gonna have you take the podium here and i'm gonna come down here there's hundreds of millions of people in our position today worshiping the lord jesus doing their best thinking about him but there has to be an elect there has to be a few people just a handful that will take that extra step and say you know what i believe him and i'm going to believe him today i'm going to believe him through my life i'm going to believe every single thing about him i am going to believe this resurrection story friends can we stand sister brother etta if you could start on a song friends this story of easter let this be a day that we came and we worshiped together and i i was so blessed by your brothers i was just it was beautiful thinking about the lord jesus and thinking about what he's done for all of us and thinking about the story of mary and then thinking about about what brother peter said that it was not just for his son it was for all of us and i think that that jesus if if it wasn't for this resurrection we would have had to take somebody's word for it no that that someday that that there's going to be a resurrection but jesus showed us that it's true he showed us that he can do it and i'll hold fast i know i believe that story is true do you all believe that story amen i do friends i believe it all and let's let's pray together you can you can raise your hands you can come to the altar you can kneel down in your in your seats whatever you feel that the lord jesus will hear you whatever you feel that will please him let's do it as with our heads as i said however you want to worship however you want to praise you could be here at the altar you could be laying hands on one another in your
