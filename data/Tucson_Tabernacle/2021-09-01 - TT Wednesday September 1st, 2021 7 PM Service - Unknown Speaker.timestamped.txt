[34:53] answer from you

[36:55] [Music]
[37:06] how we get so anxious sometimes
[37:09] watch the clock sometimes even watch the
[37:12] second hand taking
[37:15] the other day
[37:16] my wife she says you need to learn how
[37:18] to use the alarm on your
[37:21] on your phone so that
[37:23] you don't burn the house down i left a
[37:25] pot of water going and forgot all about
[37:27] it
[37:28] until it burned the pot and smoked the
[37:30] house
[37:33] and so she set the alarm for me
[37:35] and i watched it for 15 minutes
[37:38] it was going to take 15 minutes whether
[37:40] i watched it or not but
[37:42] lord teach me to wait
[37:44] but wait patiently trusting believing so
[37:48] we have some requests to bring to your
[37:50] attention
[37:52] brother dan evans asked prayer for his
[37:55] cousin brother daniel
[37:57] his name is uh ronald evans he's back in
[38:00] jeffersonville he's in intensive care
[38:04] and on a ventilator with covet he's
[38:06] 48 years old and he has
[38:08] his children so
[38:10] i spoke with brother matt
[38:12] watkins or text and
[38:14] their family had been exposed to covid
[38:17] so they were going to have to be tested
[38:19] and possibly quarantine
[38:22] they don't know for sure so
[38:24] i also spoke with brother robert he did
[38:27] not have an update on brother richard
[38:28] wilson
[38:30] neither better or worse but his serious
[38:32] he was seriously ill so
[38:36] brother ray erickson i heard the other
[38:38] day when i was listening to one of their
[38:39] services brother ray had been quite sick
[38:42] so i called him up today and he said he
[38:44] was feeling much better it's something
[38:46] that affected his stomach and
[38:48] but he appreciated our prayers so we'll
[38:50] continue
[38:52] and just thinking of
[38:54] i've not heard an update on sister sarah
[38:56] roberts has anybody
[38:58] heard anything but we'll continue to
[39:00] remember them in prayer
[39:02] and i was thinking about brother jordan
[39:04] and sister martha as they travel
[39:06] especially with this storm working its
[39:08] way back
[39:09] back there
[39:10] and all those that are traveling our
[39:12] outlets so
[39:13] we'll remember that so
[39:16] and i'll ask you to remember me tomorrow
[39:18] morning at nine i
[39:20] go to a surgeon's office to
[39:22] [Music]
[39:23] i've had a growth on my back up high
[39:26] for quite some time but it never
[39:28] bothered me and recently it began to get
[39:30] quite painful and
[39:32] and infected and all and i was crawling
[39:35] inside a cabinet to do some work and i
[39:37] put it right into the top of the cabinet
[39:39] and
[39:40] it hurt
[39:42] and so it started doing that so
[39:44] yesterday they actually opened it and
[39:47] cleaned it out
[39:48] but the doctor recommended that i get it
[39:50] removed so we'll see a surgeon tomorrow
[39:54] and
[39:55] i know who the master surgeon is i
[39:59] i know that but brother random also
[40:01] tells us that god uses doctors
[40:03] so we just pray that all will be well
[40:05] and
[40:06] you have a need say lord i believe and
[40:10] sometimes we do have to say lord help
[40:11] down my unbelief too so if you'll stand
[40:13] with me
[40:16] just bow our heads
[40:19] lord we come to you and
[40:21] these bodies the physical body the
[40:24] natural body the man body
[40:26] are not eternal but there's an eternal
[40:28] life within us lord
[40:30] and we're believing that lord we're
[40:32] we're looking for a change
[40:34] to leave this old
[40:36] corruption behind and step into that new
[40:38] body
[40:39] even the creation today cries out
[40:42] oh they're waiting for the manifestation
[40:44] of the sons of god lord and
[40:46] we believe that lord now each hand that
[40:48] was raised in each request that was
[40:50] asked lord and every heart that's
[40:52] represented those listening in maybe
[40:55] however they're attuned to the service
[40:57] today lord will you minister to each one
[40:59] of them lord
[41:00] as you know best lord
[41:02] and we'll be careful to say thank you
[41:03] and we love you lord jesus in jesus
[41:06] christ's name
[41:08] amen amen
[41:10] a couple of announcements and then
[41:13] we'll be
[41:17] turning the service over to brother dan
[41:19] evans but
[41:20] brother peter sister lydia
[41:23] had a little boy
[41:26] eight o'clock into this morning brother

[41:35] and um
[41:36] myself and the girls were at the dinner
[41:39] table and
[41:41] we were trying to guess his name
[41:43] because
[41:44] there was some hints along the line of
[41:45] it
[41:46] so when i was talking to brother peter
[41:48] and i said uh
[41:49] i know one of the names and he goes how

[41:55] that left but
[41:56] zion daniel mcfadden
[41:58] he was like nine pounds over nine pounds
[42:01] of a big boy but they're both doing well
[42:03] talking about peter so i appreciate that

[46:04] in jesus name i pray amen
[46:07] amen you can take your seats
[46:14] i appreciate
[46:16] y'all praying for my cousin um
[46:19] ronald is uh he and i grew up together
[46:21] and went in high school together
[46:24] and uh he's just a couple years younger
[46:26] than me and
[46:28] it's such an it's such an odd time
[46:31] that i had coveted about a year ago and
[46:34] and i had a headache for a couple days
[46:36] and a stuffy nose
[46:39] and
[46:40] my cousin has it and and he's in
[46:43] intensive care and they
[46:46] they um he kept getting worse and worse
[46:48] and worse and they went to put the
[46:49] ventilator
[46:51] into him and his heart stopped
[46:54] and they were able to revive him and
[46:56] that happened yesterday and they were
[46:57] able to revive him
[46:59] and uh it's
[47:01] it's it's such a strange disease when
[47:04] have you ever seen a disease that can
[47:06] just give one person a stuffy nose
[47:10] and then
[47:11] put another person on a ventilator and
[47:13] another person just kill him
[47:15] i
[47:16] work with someone that
[47:18] a friend of hers was 33 years old
[47:20] and she got covered and had a heart
[47:23] attack and died healthy healthy girl
[47:26] so it's such an odd time but i think
[47:28] it's it's indicative of the the world
[47:31] that we live in today
[47:33] and and
[47:34] what's going on is such a strange time
[47:37] we see all these things happening
[47:38] overseas and we see this disease and we
[47:41] see
[47:42] the politics of the world friends i
[47:44] don't believe it's ever been like this
[47:47] it's such a strange thing and even in my
[47:50] own personal life what's happened to me
[47:52] over the past year
[47:55] with with the cut with the shutdown and
[47:57] how kovid came in and we all started
[47:59] working from home and then i got
[48:01] bitten by a spider
[48:04] and
[48:05] the thing i had i had 103 temperature
[48:09] for
[48:10] three days i spent three days in the
[48:12] hospital the um the surgeon came in and
[48:15] said
[48:16] we need to operate right now
[48:18] and took a
[48:20] a chunk the size of a baseball out of my
[48:22] leg
[48:24] and and then then i i got this crazy
[48:28] disease while i was in the hospital from
[48:29] all the
[48:30] all of the antibiotics they gave me and
[48:33] that was worse
[48:34] as an intestinal disease and that was
[48:36] worse than the spider bite
[48:38] and
[48:39] and then uh
[48:41] then i quit my job
[48:44] and then i got covered and then i moved
[48:46] to tucson
[48:48] kind of
[48:49] um
[48:50] in the process and and uh we'll we'll be
[48:52] here in the next couple months
[48:54] permanently
[48:55] and then my dad died and then my
[48:57] daughter got married
[49:00] and then i'm a preacher now
[49:02] and that's what's what's crazy is the
[49:04] last one is the strangest part about
[49:06] everything
[49:07] and my mother-in-law there she can she
[49:09] can attest that's the truth
[49:11] so it's it's an odd time and it but it's
[49:13] an exciting time
[49:15] we see
[49:16] god doing things and he's moving and i
[49:19] look at this little church here and like
[49:21] i said last time wednesday nights
[49:25] to me i love it because these are the
[49:27] pillars in the church
[49:30] these are the ones that hold up the
[49:32] church they're the ones with their
[49:34] attendance with with their efforts that
[49:36] they give
[49:38] with the deacons the trustees
[49:40] the the people that come
[49:42] this is the core
[49:45] and it's an honor
[49:47] to speak to you on this wednesday night
[49:49] to speak to the elders in the church to
[49:52] the pillars in the church and and i love
[49:56] wednesday nights
[49:57] it's it's an exciting time
[49:59] to me because of who i'm who i'm talking
[50:01] to
[50:03] we uh
[50:05] we're seeing in the world today
[50:08] we see all of the of these the different
[50:10] politics going on and we see the
[50:12] churches
[50:14] the churches are taking these sides
[50:17] and they're dividing themselves and
[50:19] sometimes you have you have these mega
[50:20] churches that they don't really believe
[50:22] anything
[50:23] you know and they're going and just oh
[50:25] everything's good and just come in and
[50:27] be happy and
[50:28] and all this and then you see you see
[50:31] these other churches and they divide and
[50:33] they separate and the denominations are
[50:35] pretty much a thing of the past now now
[50:37] it's just it's just churches and against
[50:41] other churches and we're looking even to
[50:42] the message
[50:44] and we see the division that's going on
[50:47] and everyone has their own ideas
[50:51] and
[50:52] if you don't follow that idea
[50:56] then you're out
[50:59] and and it's it's
[51:01] and they're willing to enforce those
[51:03] ideas
[51:05] and i am i ministered a couple weeks ago
[51:09] on the book of daniel
[51:11] and how in daniel chapter 2 excuse me
[51:15] in daniel chapter 2
[51:18] that
[51:21] the king had this dream nebuchadnezzar
[51:22] had this dream
[51:25] and it really troubled him and he he
[51:28] goes and he calls all of all of the holy
[51:30] men in babylon and he says now listen i
[51:32] had this dream it's a big deal i want
[51:35] you to i want you to come and i want you
[51:38] to interpret this dream for me
[51:41] and of course the holy men are like
[51:42] great we can do that but he said but
[51:44] there's a catch
[51:45] he said
[51:46] i'm not going to tell you the dream
[51:49] you've got to tell me the dream
[51:51] and if you don't tell me the dream
[51:54] you're going to die
[51:56] i'm going to kill you and all of your
[51:59] friends with you
[52:01] so this decree went out and
[52:05] and everybody was upset
[52:06] well it finally got to daniel
[52:09] and daniel comes and to make a long
[52:12] story short daniel comes and he
[52:13] interprets the dream of nebuchadnezzar
[52:18] and nebuchadnezzar
[52:21] it really impressed him
[52:24] brother while it would be like
[52:26] the man in the pulpit saying
[52:28] your name is this you live at this
[52:30] address you're this you're this be
[52:33] healed in the name of jesus and then go
[52:35] into the next one the next one next one
[52:37] so the king saw this
[52:39] and it really impressed him so what he
[52:41] did is he had in his mind
[52:43] what this holy man was
[52:47] and he built this giant image
[52:52] with this holy man in mind he built this
[52:55] giant image and he says this is what
[52:58] this holy man is and he he put it up in
[53:02] a province in babylon
[53:04] and he said everyone look at this image
[53:07] and that is this
[53:09] holy man
[53:11] but the fact is that was not real that
[53:14] was just an idea that the king had of
[53:16] this holy man and there's daniel over
[53:19] here living his life
[53:21] praying three times a day
[53:24] making mistakes doing the best that he
[53:26] can trying as hard as he could
[53:30] and the king
[53:31] because he had in his mind what this was
[53:33] he erected this image
[53:37] and made people worship it we know we
[53:39] know the story
[53:41] so
[53:44] we see that and we see it so common in
[53:46] the world today we see the democrats and
[53:48] the republicans this is the image of the
[53:49] country and we see we see the message
[53:52] churches well we have
[53:54] you have you have to listen to tapes
[53:56] only you can't have a minister in the
[53:57] pulpit and then we have over here saying
[54:00] no you can't listen to tapes it's the
[54:01] five-fold ministry that perfects the
[54:03] bride we we have to have that then over
[54:05] here you say no no it's the seven
[54:06] thunders that are perfecting the bride
[54:08] we need to get that and all of these
[54:11] and friends so often they're images that
[54:13] we've created in our mind because the
[54:15] way we've been raised the way we've been
[54:17] taught in church and we raise these
[54:19] images in our mind and they're not real
[54:24] and then
[54:26] we cut other people out
[54:28] because it doesn't match our image
[54:31] i got a phone call one one time from a
[54:33] catholic priest
[54:36] and
[54:37] this priest
[54:39] got a hold of brother branham's message
[54:43] and uh he um
[54:45] it impressed him
[54:46] he started listening more
[54:48] more
[54:50] and uh
[54:51] he had a good sized parish i can't
[54:52] remember if it was in philadelphia or
[54:54] new york
[54:55] had a real eastern accent
[54:58] but he started
[55:00] integrating brother brown's message into
[55:02] his sermon
[55:04] because it's real
[55:05] he saw something that was real in this
[55:07] man
[55:08] so he started integrating this message
[55:10] into his sermons
[55:12] and then
[55:13] friends
[55:14] what happened one day is a lady he said
[55:18] she was in the back stood up
[55:21] and spoke in tongues
[55:23] now this is a catholic church you got
[55:25] peter over here and mary over here and
[55:27] you've got all this gold and all this
[55:29] weirdness
[55:30] and there is a lady speaking in tongues
[55:33] and what he did is in that sermon he
[55:35] said that is correct according to the
[55:39] bible
[55:40] and he continued on and these gifts
[55:43] started manifesting themselves in his
[55:46] church
[55:48] but
[55:49] they weren't the image that he had in
[55:50] his mind that the church had in their
[55:52] mind and many of the people
[55:55] and they were like this isn't right this
[55:57] isn't right this isn't one what i grew
[55:59] up with this isn't our church this is
[56:01] this is different
[56:04] and they told on him
[56:07] the powers to be kicked him out
[56:10] and he told me he said brother he said
[56:12] i love being a priest
[56:14] he said i loved the people
[56:17] he said but they kicked me out
[56:19] and what they did is that church
[56:23] and that
[56:24] denomination
[56:27] god gave them a gift the gift started to
[56:31] come and what they did is they put up
[56:34] their hand and said i don't want your
[56:37] gift
[56:38] i don't want it it doesn't match the way
[56:40] i think it should be
[56:43] and how often does that happen
[56:46] and it it's present in all of us friends
[56:48] when i'm up here ministering i'm not
[56:50] ministering about the catholic church we
[56:53] all know
[56:54] that
[56:55] i'm talking about me
[56:57] i'm talking about
[56:58] you
[56:59] and i'm trying to get us to think about
[57:02] ourselves to examine ourselves
[57:05] and it could be it could be anything
[57:09] it could be it just doesn't feel right
[57:11] you know the devil can impersonate our
[57:12] feelings and he does
[57:15] it's like well you know this this kind
[57:16] of music i don't like this kind of music
[57:18] in church you know it's too contemporary
[57:20] or or this kind of music you know it's
[57:22] too old-fashioned or what whatever i i
[57:25] don't like that it doesn't it doesn't
[57:27] feel right it's not according to the
[57:28] word
[57:29] but do you pray about it
[57:31] do you ask the lord lord is this what
[57:33] you want
[57:35] not what i grew up with
[57:37] not what i learned
[57:38] not music 60 70 years ago
[57:42] but
[57:42] is this what you want today
[57:46] and we go to prayer instead of instead
[57:48] of thinking
[57:49] of our of our wants and our desires
[57:53] but we we should go to prayer
[57:55] over these things and ask the lord
[57:58] what do you want
[58:00] and then you'll see a church with an
[58:02] open mind
[58:05] you know not not open to sin of course
[58:07] not
[58:08] but you'll see that church grow
[58:11] in holiness
[58:12] not open to sin but an open mind to the
[58:15] lord whatever you want to send whatever
[58:18] gift you want to send
[58:20] i'm willing to take it not stick our
[58:22] hands in his face and say i don't want
[58:24] your gift
[58:25] and we need to be careful of that
[58:28] because it's so easy
[58:30] to do
[58:33] i
[58:34] uh and even in the message
[58:38] we say well
[58:39] you can't preach on a scripture that
[58:41] brother branham didn't preach on because
[58:44] we don't know what that means
[58:45] that's not true my bible says that all
[58:48] scripture
[58:49] is given by inspiration of god and good
[58:52] for doctrine
[58:54] so we can't we we don't want to go that
[58:56] way that's just that's just that image
[58:58] in our mind that i talked about
[58:59] nebuchadnezzar these are gifts from god
[59:02] and we need to be willing to accept
[59:04] those if they're according to the word
[59:06] and if they're given by god
[59:09] we see
[59:11] in the message
[59:12] and in the and in the world itself
[59:15] brother john andy's he's spoken here a
[59:17] few times
[59:18] he's he's now he's on fire he's going
[59:20] around the country and he's just
[59:22] preaching everywhere man he's he told me
[59:24] his schedule and it's like every sunday
[59:26] twice and every wednesday and he's going
[59:28] and going and going and he's been a
[59:30] minister he's my age and he's been a
[59:31] minister since he was a teenager
[59:34] and he's told me he says brother he says
[59:36] i've never seen it like it is now
[59:39] the people are so willing to accept
[59:43] the lord and they're they're getting
[59:45] away from those doctrines
[59:48] and brother john has been excited i have
[59:50] i have a new friend
[59:51] um
[59:52] up in phoenix
[59:54] his name's aaron mcgarry
[59:56] and uh
[59:58] if you know brother aaron
[1:00:00] um
[1:00:01] and you know me
[1:00:04] you've never seen two more opposite
[1:00:06] sides
[1:00:08] of the so-called message than him and me
[1:00:12] the way we grew up and and where we were
[1:00:14] from i mean he's
[1:00:16] five-fold ministry i am tapes only man
[1:00:19] and we are not friends
[1:00:22] but
[1:00:23] brother aaron he's just won my love and
[1:00:26] he's won my respect and he's got
[1:00:29] and he's told me the same thing the lord
[1:00:31] is doing something
[1:00:33] and what it is is it's people willing to
[1:00:36] accept these gifts
[1:00:38] that god gives
[1:00:41] that that before
[1:00:44] it'd be more like i don't want it
[1:00:46] it doesn't doesn't match
[1:00:51] the
[1:00:52] way i think a minister should be
[1:00:54] it doesn't match the way i think a
[1:00:56] deacon should be a trustee it doesn't
[1:00:58] match the way i think the song leader
[1:01:00] should be
[1:01:01] but there's there's people there's
[1:01:03] there's a movement rising up and i can
[1:01:05] see it
[1:01:06] that god is he's he's stirring the pie
[1:01:10] and and he's he's getting us ready
[1:01:13] for a work that's coming and i think
[1:01:15] it's already coming
[1:01:17] i think it's already starting to be here
[1:01:20] and this work
[1:01:21] is is going to be done and it is being
[1:01:24] done by a body
[1:01:26] now a body
[1:01:28] this church is not the body of christ
[1:01:31] it's not
[1:01:33] each of us
[1:01:34] are the body of christ and each of us
[1:01:38] have a gift
[1:01:40] to bring to the church to bring to the
[1:01:43] body and we should never
[1:01:46] think that we don't
[1:01:47] and we should be praying friends and
[1:01:50] seeking that gift lord what do you want
[1:01:52] me to do
[1:01:53] i'm
[1:01:54] i'm in that position right now lord what
[1:01:56] do you want me to do i don't i don't
[1:01:58] know where you want me to be
[1:02:00] but i want to be where you want me to be
[1:02:03] do you want me out on the street
[1:02:04] witnessing i can do that do you want me
[1:02:07] to to help the church with a website i
[1:02:09] can do that what do you want me to do
[1:02:12] and each of us needs to seek that
[1:02:16] and
[1:02:17] what i wanted to minister on tonight
[1:02:22] is
[1:02:23] how paul
[1:02:25] was was laying the foundation
[1:02:29] for that
[1:02:31] and he says throughout his writings he
[1:02:34] says he says you know he says you can't
[1:02:36] he says the hand
[1:02:38] it can't be the foot and the eye can't
[1:02:40] be the ear everyone is different
[1:02:43] and and we look at what what paul wrote
[1:02:45] we look at each other
[1:02:47] and unity
[1:02:49] and i believe we should seek unity unity
[1:02:53] is not uniformity
[1:02:56] we don't all look the same we don't i
[1:02:58] like the same we don't all have the same
[1:02:59] ministry we're all different but we
[1:03:02] should be unified in one body operating
[1:03:05] for the
[1:03:06] for the perfecting
[1:03:08] of the body
[1:03:11] let's uh
[1:03:14] the apostle paul
[1:03:16] he wrote a letter
[1:03:18] to the church at ephesus
[1:03:21] and this letter brother branham said
[1:03:24] that
[1:03:25] this letter that paul wrote called the
[1:03:27] ephesian called ephesians
[1:03:30] that letter typed
[1:03:32] joshua
[1:03:34] now what what a
[1:03:36] it's a it's a very powerful statement
[1:03:38] that brother branham made that this
[1:03:39] letter of the ephesians typed joshua and
[1:03:41] then you start reading the ephesians
[1:03:43] like oh
[1:03:45] paul is preparing the church
[1:03:49] the book of joshua that's what joshua's
[1:03:51] job was is to prepare this body to go
[1:03:55] over
[1:03:56] jordan
[1:03:58] and you see and that's the same thing
[1:04:00] going on in this book of ephesians if
[1:04:01] you turn turn with me to ephesians
[1:04:03] chapter 2.
[1:04:11] brother brown preached
[1:04:13] the adoption series
[1:04:17] and
[1:04:19] he said
[1:04:20] that we are adopted
[1:04:23] or brother branham used the word placed
[1:04:26] into the body of christ
[1:04:28] each one of us
[1:04:30] like a puzzle
[1:04:32] the puzzle has to have
[1:04:34] each piece put together
[1:04:36] and man if you if you have this puzzle
[1:04:38] and you lose a couple pieces it is such
[1:04:41] a letdown you know you got those puzzles
[1:04:43] like man i wish i had those two pieces
[1:04:45] because it's not complete that's how
[1:04:47] each of us are
[1:04:48] no no piece is any greater than the
[1:04:50] other one
[1:04:52] but we need to all be there for that
[1:04:54] picture
[1:04:55] to be whole
[1:04:58] and and brother branham he preached that
[1:05:00] adoption series
[1:05:03] and he told us that we are positionally
[1:05:06] placed in christ
[1:05:09] and friends when
[1:05:11] when we approach the word and i start to
[1:05:14] get nervous
[1:05:16] before i read it
[1:05:18] is
[1:05:20] as brother branham said many times he
[1:05:21] said my words were fail
[1:05:23] he said but but this word this will
[1:05:26] never fail
[1:05:28] i was um
[1:05:31] a brother i knew in jeffersonville he
[1:05:33] left the message he
[1:05:34] he said uh it's all false brother
[1:05:37] branham lied and all this and this and
[1:05:38] this
[1:05:40] and i i called them up i felt it on my
[1:05:42] heart to call them up they said brother
[1:05:43] i said let's uh
[1:05:44] let's you know go get a cup of coffee or
[1:05:46] something and
[1:05:47] and he said all right you know let's go
[1:05:50] so so we go and we meet at the coffee
[1:05:52] place and man his he had his guns drawn
[1:05:56] and he was ready to rumble he was ready
[1:05:59] to fight he had his scriptures he had
[1:06:00] his quotes he had everything ready and
[1:06:03] he was ready to go to battle with this
[1:06:05] guy that works with voice of god
[1:06:08] and so he starts
[1:06:12] and i said brother i said let me read to
[1:06:14] you something brother branham said
[1:06:18] i said and i read a quote and it was
[1:06:20] this
[1:06:21] it said
[1:06:23] brother branham
[1:06:24] said in reading his bible he said my
[1:06:27] words will fail
[1:06:29] but these words will never fail and i
[1:06:32] asked him i said what do you not believe
[1:06:34] about that
[1:06:36] and all of his quotes and all of his
[1:06:37] everything he's
[1:06:39] it was shot down
[1:06:41] and even him his spirit changed
[1:06:44] and he said you know he says you're
[1:06:45] right
[1:06:46] he says brother branham didn't teach
[1:06:50] what we say he taught and that image
[1:06:53] that i just talked about
[1:06:55] that's this image that we have created
[1:06:58] that nebuchadnezzar created of daniel
[1:07:01] but it wasn't real
[1:07:04] daniel
[1:07:06] was a man
[1:07:07] wonderful man
[1:07:09] greatest man on earth
[1:07:10] and and brought and brought a wonderful
[1:07:12] message but he wasn't what
[1:07:15] nebuchadnezzar made him to be
[1:07:19] and this brother saw that and he said
[1:07:21] you know you're right
[1:07:23] and
[1:07:24] now today he has a different attitude
[1:07:29] um
[1:07:30] let's uh
[1:07:31] before we approach the word let's pray
[1:07:35] lord jesus i don't approach your word
[1:07:37] lightly
[1:07:39] i know it's
[1:07:40] it's
[1:07:41] a gift to us lord and and it's
[1:07:44] it's the full truth of jesus christ
[1:07:48] and lord as i read the words that you
[1:07:51] brought to us through your apostle paul
[1:07:53] i pray that the same anointing
[1:07:56] is here today that was there when paul
[1:07:59] wrote these words down
[1:08:01] granted lord in jesus name
[1:08:03] amen
[1:08:05] let's uh
[1:08:07] my brother if if you would put up let's
[1:08:10] start with ephesians chapter 2
[1:08:12] and verse 10.
[1:08:22] what i was talking about before paul
[1:08:23] says for we are his workmanship created
[1:08:26] in christ
[1:08:27] created in christ jesus unto good works
[1:08:30] which god hath before ordained that we
[1:08:34] should walk in them now paul was an
[1:08:38] educated author
[1:08:41] paul if you read his writings he is
[1:08:43] starting to lay a foundation here
[1:08:47] for what he's going to he's going to
[1:08:49] finish in his letter
[1:08:53] let's go to uh
[1:08:54] the next chapter let's go to ephesians
[1:08:58] chapter 3
[1:08:59] and i'll
[1:09:00] read i'll start with verse 8 my brother
[1:09:09] and paul says this
[1:09:11] he says unto me whom less than the least
[1:09:14] of all the saints is this grace given
[1:09:16] that i should preach among the gentiles
[1:09:18] the unsearchable
[1:09:20] riches of christ
[1:09:22] and to make all men see what is the
[1:09:24] fellowship of the mystery which from the
[1:09:26] beginning of the world hath not hid hath
[1:09:29] not been hid in god who created all
[1:09:31] things by
[1:09:33] half i'm sorry i said that wrong
[1:09:36] the beginning of the world hath been hid
[1:09:39] in god
[1:09:40] who created all things by jesus christ
[1:09:44] to the intent that now unto the
[1:09:46] principalities and powers in heavenly
[1:09:49] places might be known by the church the
[1:09:52] manifold wisdom
[1:09:54] of god
[1:09:57] according to the eternal purpose which
[1:09:59] he purposed in christ jesus our lord in
[1:10:01] whom we have boldness and access with
[1:10:04] confidence by the faith in him
[1:10:10] wherefore i desire
[1:10:11] that you faint not at my tribulations
[1:10:15] for you which is your glory
[1:10:17] for this cause i bow my knees unto the
[1:10:20] father of our lord jesus christ of whom
[1:10:23] the whole family in heaven and earth is
[1:10:25] named
[1:10:27] that he would grant you
[1:10:28] according to the riches of his glory to
[1:10:31] be strengthened with might by his spirit
[1:10:35] in the inner man that christ may dwell
[1:10:38] in your hearts by faith that ye
[1:10:42] being rooted and grouted in love
[1:10:45] may be able to comprehend with all
[1:10:48] saints what is the breadth and the
[1:10:51] length and the depth and the height and
[1:10:53] the height and to know the love of
[1:10:55] christ which passes knowledge that ye
[1:10:58] might be filled with the fullness of god
[1:11:01] what an incredible statement our brother
[1:11:05] paul has just made
[1:11:06] now we see in revelation chapter 5 we
[1:11:08] see jesus on his throne and he's
[1:11:11] surrounded by a hundred million angels
[1:11:16] 100 million i did the math my brother
[1:11:19] a hundred million angels i don't know
[1:11:21] the difference between 100 million and
[1:11:22] 50 million but it's a lot
[1:11:25] and there it is and they're up there and
[1:11:26] these angels are all crying
[1:11:29] they're saying worthy is the lamb that
[1:11:31] was slain
[1:11:33] and and he's surrounded by these angels
[1:11:35] what would one angel do
[1:11:37] a hundred million angels surrounding him
[1:11:40] all worshiping him and then
[1:11:43] he
[1:11:44] wants to be known
[1:11:46] by
[1:11:47] me
[1:11:49] he wants a relationship with me
[1:11:51] he wants a relationship with you here is
[1:11:54] this great being
[1:11:57] in heaven
[1:11:59] surrounded by 100 million angels all
[1:12:01] all crying worthy art thou
[1:12:04] and yet
[1:12:06] he wants that relationship with me
[1:12:08] not only that is he wants to live as the
[1:12:11] bible says just now he wants to live in
[1:12:13] my heart
[1:12:15] friends we shouldn't as we're reading
[1:12:17] this bible we shouldn't just read over
[1:12:19] it
[1:12:21] we should just
[1:12:22] we should digest
[1:12:24] each scripture don't go to the next
[1:12:27] scripture
[1:12:28] without digesting the first one
[1:12:31] else you know i was just reading it's
[1:12:33] like oh that's nice you know that's good
[1:12:34] you know go to the next oh it's
[1:12:35] beautiful memorize that one no
[1:12:38] really digest it
[1:12:41] here is this this great being
[1:12:44] and paul says this he says he says that
[1:12:47] we may be able to comprehend with all
[1:12:48] the saints what is the breadth and the
[1:12:50] length and the depth and the height and
[1:12:51] to know the love of christ with pat
[1:12:53] which passes knowledge that you might be
[1:12:56] filled with the fullness of god the
[1:12:58] fullness of the one that's up there
[1:13:02] he's surrounded by these angels
[1:13:05] and he said that you that we might be
[1:13:07] filled with his fullness
[1:13:09] that's called the holy spirit it's a big
[1:13:11] deal
[1:13:13] we take it so lightly
[1:13:15] it is a big it is everything to be
[1:13:18] filled with the holy spirit look at what
[1:13:20] a powerful thing it is
[1:13:23] that we might be filled with that spirit
[1:13:26] friends don't we don't take it lightly
[1:13:29] it's it's very important let's go on he
[1:13:31] says this
[1:13:33] and to know the love of christ with pat
[1:13:35] which passes knowledge that you might be
[1:13:38] filled with all the fullness of god now
[1:13:40] unto him that is able to do exceedingly
[1:13:42] abundantly above all that we ask or
[1:13:44] think according to the power that
[1:13:47] worketh in us
[1:13:49] unto him
[1:13:50] be
[1:13:51] glory in the church by christ jesus
[1:13:54] throughout all the ages without world
[1:13:56] amen
[1:13:58] now paul is leading into
[1:14:04] these gifts
[1:14:08] and
[1:14:10] this is the scripture i hope that i have
[1:14:13] time
[1:14:14] there's there's another scripture
[1:14:16] outside of the book ephesians of
[1:14:18] ephesians
[1:14:19] that places us all
[1:14:21] in the body of christ that we can look
[1:14:23] and we can see ourselves
[1:14:26] in that in that scripture and in that
[1:14:28] word but let's let's stay with ephesians
[1:14:30] 4 here
[1:14:32] paul says i therefore
[1:14:34] the prisoner of the lord beseech you
[1:14:38] that you walk worthy of the vocation
[1:14:40] where with ye are called
[1:14:44] in other words walk worthy of the
[1:14:46] calling
[1:14:47] wherewith you're called
[1:14:49] so we all lord we pray that we want
[1:14:51] these gifts but the lord requires
[1:14:53] something from us
[1:14:55] he doesn't require anything of us from
[1:14:57] us other than we accept him for
[1:14:59] salvation
[1:15:00] but if we want to be these pillars of
[1:15:03] the church if we want to bring those
[1:15:05] gifts he requires something from us
[1:15:09] that we walk worthy
[1:15:12] of these callings that we have
[1:15:15] now
[1:15:16] the bible in another place that says
[1:15:17] gifts and callings are without
[1:15:19] repentance
[1:15:20] what that means is god doesn't give them
[1:15:22] to you and take them back
[1:15:24] you can be a sinner
[1:15:26] and still have a gift
[1:15:28] you know you can be you can be a
[1:15:29] beautiful singer and
[1:15:30] and use it for the for the enemy
[1:15:32] you can be a preacher
[1:15:34] and use it for the enemy
[1:15:36] you can be a great speaker and deceive
[1:15:38] many
[1:15:40] those gifts are from god
[1:15:42] and god doesn't take them back
[1:15:44] but we use those gifts in the right way
[1:15:50] with all lowliness
[1:15:51] and meekness
[1:15:53] with long-suffering
[1:15:55] forbearing one another
[1:15:57] in love
[1:16:00] oh i could go on and on and on
[1:16:04] we have to have patience with one
[1:16:06] another friends
[1:16:07] we have to look past it if somebody does
[1:16:09] something wrong or isn't quite right
[1:16:11] look past it we might sometimes find
[1:16:12] that we're the ones that are wrong
[1:16:15] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[1:16:18] spirit in the bond of peace
[1:16:27] keep the unity in the spirit so often
[1:16:30] satan comes in remember the images i
[1:16:32] talked about and he divides us
[1:16:34] i think it should be this way and this
[1:16:36] this person said well i want a pastor
[1:16:38] that that does this and this one says
[1:16:40] well i want a pastor that does this and
[1:16:42] this one says well i want music like
[1:16:44] this and this one says well we should
[1:16:45] have this many deacons and not that many
[1:16:47] deacons and here's what paul says he's
[1:16:49] like hey
[1:16:50] just keep the unity
[1:16:52] of the spirit
[1:16:54] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[1:16:56] spirit in the bond of peace
[1:16:58] there's one body and one spirit
[1:17:01] even as you are called in one hope of
[1:17:03] your calling
[1:17:05] one lord one faith one baptism
[1:17:09] one god and the father of all who is
[1:17:11] above all and through all and in you all
[1:17:19] but unto every one of us
[1:17:21] is given grace according to the measure
[1:17:23] of the gift of christ wherefore he saith
[1:17:26] when he ascended up on high he led
[1:17:29] captivity captive and gave gifts
[1:17:32] unto men now paul is laying his
[1:17:34] foundation here now he's going to say
[1:17:36] something
[1:17:38] he said now he that ascended
[1:17:41] what is it but that he also descended
[1:17:43] first into the lower parts of the earth
[1:17:45] he that descended is the same also that
[1:17:47] ascended up far above all heavens that
[1:17:50] he might fill all things
[1:17:53] now the scripture i'm going to read next
[1:17:55] is a very controversial scripture in
[1:17:59] the message ranks
[1:18:01] it shouldn't be because i'm going to
[1:18:02] read a quote to you here in a minute
[1:18:04] that explains all this and it shows you
[1:18:06] where both sides are wrong
[1:18:12] and he gave some apostles
[1:18:15] and some prophets and some evangelists
[1:18:18] and some pastors and teachers
[1:18:21] four
[1:18:23] very very important word here
[1:18:26] for
[1:18:28] the perfecting of the saints for the
[1:18:31] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[1:18:33] the body of christ
[1:18:36] now
[1:18:38] i hear over here it says well the tapes
[1:18:40] are going to perfect the bride
[1:18:42] oh and then i hear over here no the
[1:18:44] fivefold ministry perfects the bride
[1:18:46] it's not what the word says
[1:18:48] the word says that these gifts are for
[1:18:51] the perfecting of the bride am i right
[1:18:54] it says that
[1:18:56] now brother jeremy if you could put up
[1:18:58] my quote there
[1:18:59] brother branham addressed
[1:19:02] this very question i almost forbade him
[1:19:06] and and this is a quote that you don't
[1:19:08] hear quoted very much by either side
[1:19:10] because it doesn't fit their narrative
[1:19:12] it doesn't necessarily fit the image
[1:19:14] that they have of the message
[1:19:16] but it answers the question
[1:19:19] and the prophet in his wisdom the wisdom
[1:19:21] of the holy spirit
[1:19:22] the prophet lays it down
[1:19:25] and then we go off and we have divisions
[1:19:28] among us but the prophet already
[1:19:29] answered this question it'd be nice if
[1:19:31] we went back to what he said
[1:19:34] now let me read this this uh
[1:19:38] amazing answer this is in questions and
[1:19:40] answers
[1:19:43] preached on
[1:19:45] august 30th
[1:19:47] 1964.
[1:19:49] here's the question
[1:19:51] somebody wrote in questions and answers
[1:19:52] we all know how it was people would
[1:19:54] write in on a piece of paper and then
[1:19:56] brother branham would pick it out and he
[1:19:57] would he would read it and he would
[1:19:58] answer the question
[1:20:00] and he says this
[1:20:02] here's the question dearly beloved
[1:20:04] let's see about the scripture of
[1:20:06] ephesians 4 11 which i just read
[1:20:09] ephesians 4 11 through 13.
[1:20:12] do we all let's see do we all get the
[1:20:15] perfecting of the saints through the
[1:20:17] tapes
[1:20:19] or should we be here where the gifts of
[1:20:21] the spirit are operating in different
[1:20:23] offices of the churches to help us to
[1:20:25] help perfect us
[1:20:27] our hearts have believed all of the word
[1:20:30] of the
[1:20:30] lord and friends we've all heard
[1:20:34] this division that's in the church
[1:20:36] and we've all heard that that no you the
[1:20:39] the tapes are what perfects the bride
[1:20:42] brother brahma never said it and over
[1:20:44] here another five full ministry perfects
[1:20:46] the bride brother brandon never said
[1:20:47] that either
[1:20:48] and what's so strange to me is is like
[1:20:51] 50 60 years ago it was still on the
[1:20:53] people's minds
[1:20:55] so thank god that he preserved this for
[1:20:57] us
[1:20:59] now brother branham then he goes on in
[1:21:00] paragraph 219 there
[1:21:02] he tells who wrote the
[1:21:04] wrote the um the question
[1:21:06] and then he gives this answer
[1:21:09] go down my brother
[1:21:11] um
[1:21:12] you can see here he tells he tells
[1:21:15] keep going
[1:21:16] there we go
[1:21:19] he answers this
[1:21:20] he asks brother branham is it the tapes
[1:21:22] the perfected bride or is the five-fold
[1:21:24] ministry that perfects the bride i love
[1:21:27] his answer no
[1:21:29] no
[1:21:30] with an exclamation point no
[1:21:34] he says here they want to come here to
[1:21:36] the church for the perfecting sea that
[1:21:38] we get fellows that we get fellowship
[1:21:40] one another
[1:21:41] with one another here at the church
[1:21:44] but the perfecting comes between us
[1:21:48] and god
[1:21:50] the blood of christ is what perfects us
[1:21:53] in the holy spirit i say case closed on
[1:21:56] that argument
[1:21:58] neither of them are right
[1:22:00] the holy spirit
[1:22:02] is what perfects the bride friends
[1:22:04] it couldn't be anything else
[1:22:06] so let's keep let's uh keep going on
[1:22:08] ephesians 4.
[1:22:13] i'll start with verse 11 again and he
[1:22:15] gave some apostles and some prophets and
[1:22:17] some evangelists and some pastors and
[1:22:20] teachers
[1:22:21] for the perfecting of the saints for the
[1:22:24] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[1:22:26] the body of christ
[1:22:28] till we all come into the unity of the
[1:22:30] faith and of the knowledge of the son of
[1:22:31] god unto a perfect man unto the measure
[1:22:34] of the stature of the fullness of christ
[1:22:38] he's back saying that we can come into
[1:22:41] that measure to that perfection
[1:22:46] that we henceforth
[1:22:48] be no more children tossed to and fro
[1:22:50] and carried about with every wind of
[1:22:52] doctrine by the slate of men and cunning
[1:22:55] craftiness wherein whereby they lie in
[1:22:57] wait to deceive
[1:22:58] but speaking the truth in love
[1:23:02] may grow up into him in all things which
[1:23:07] is the head even christ
[1:23:09] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[1:23:11] together
[1:23:12] and compacted
[1:23:14] by that which every joint supplyeth
[1:23:18] according to the effectual working in
[1:23:20] the measure of every part
[1:23:23] he's talking about every member
[1:23:26] a hand a foot an eye and ear
[1:23:29] all of the body of christ working
[1:23:32] together
[1:23:33] every part
[1:23:34] maketh increase of the body
[1:23:38] unto the edifying of itself
[1:23:41] in love
[1:23:45] there's a
[1:23:47] god sends gifts friends i um i thought
[1:23:50] of the story
[1:23:51] and i don't know if i i heard it or if i
[1:23:53] just made it up
[1:23:55] but uh it doesn't matter because you'll
[1:23:57] see at the end it couldn't really happen
[1:23:59] but there was
[1:24:02] a man in his family
[1:24:05] and
[1:24:06] and he was downstream of a flood
[1:24:09] and in the flood waters they started to
[1:24:12] rise
[1:24:15] and they had the warnings and stuff in
[1:24:16] the fire department they came to they
[1:24:18] came to the man's house and they said
[1:24:19] the flood waters are coming
[1:24:22] they said get out get your family out
[1:24:24] and get to high ground
[1:24:26] and the man responded he said
[1:24:29] he said no he said we are trusting in
[1:24:32] the lord we're christians
[1:24:34] we're trusting in the lord that he is
[1:24:37] going to stay the waters maybe like he
[1:24:39] did joshua
[1:24:42] we're not going to do it
[1:24:44] so then the flood water started to rise
[1:24:48] and he went up to the second floor of
[1:24:49] his house with his family
[1:24:52] and here comes a boat
[1:24:54] and the fire department or the emergency
[1:24:57] rescue people they said get in the boat
[1:24:59] let's go because the waters are going to
[1:25:01] continue to rise
[1:25:03] and he says we are trusting in god
[1:25:06] we're christians we're trusting in the
[1:25:09] lord
[1:25:09] we're not going anywhere we prayed and
[1:25:12] he's gonna he's gonna take care of us
[1:25:17] rescue people leave
[1:25:19] the waters continue to rise and then he
[1:25:22] gets out and they go up on top of the
[1:25:24] roof and here comes a helicopter
[1:25:26] a loudspeaker get in the basket let's go
[1:25:29] let's get you out of here
[1:25:32] and he says we have prayed
[1:25:36] we have asked the lord and he is going
[1:25:39] to deliver us
[1:25:42] the helicopter left
[1:25:44] the flood waters rose
[1:25:46] he and his family perished in the flood
[1:25:50] so he comes before the lord
[1:25:54] and he says lord
[1:25:56] we trusted you
[1:25:58] we believed everything that you said we
[1:26:01] put our trust
[1:26:03] in your son jesus christ we put our
[1:26:05] trust into you
[1:26:09] and we we died in the flood
[1:26:12] and the lord could respond and said no
[1:26:15] i sent you three gifts
[1:26:18] i sent you the person before the flood
[1:26:21] even came i sent you the boat i sent you
[1:26:23] the helicopter and you refused it
[1:26:25] because i my gifts didn't match
[1:26:29] your image of the way i should be
[1:26:33] was the man lost i don't know if he was
[1:26:34] lost
[1:26:35] it's that's not the point
[1:26:38] the point is we can refuse god's gifts
[1:26:41] and we should not do that
[1:26:45] so friends as a church
[1:26:48] we should always pray lord we want your
[1:26:53] will
[1:26:54] and i believe the lord's stirring i
[1:26:55] believe some things are happening i'm
[1:26:57] excited about what's happening to the
[1:26:58] tucson tabernacle right now
[1:27:01] and friends it's built around
[1:27:04] these pillars right here
[1:27:06] and you all have held strong
[1:27:09] and i believe the lord
[1:27:12] is going to honor that
[1:27:15] i
[1:27:17] i wish i could
[1:27:20] go to my next scripture but
[1:27:22] i don't want to keep you late it's

[1:28:16] calling that we're called so god is able
[1:28:19] to use us so he's not he doesn't hinder
[1:28:22] us that we don't hinder him

[1:32:31] to be
[1:32:34] [Music]
[1:32:40] just no more
[1:32:43] [Music]
[1:32:45] i want to love
[1:32:49] love till there's just know
[1:32:56] i could never
[1:32:59] never have loved
[1:33:02] the lord make that promise to yourself
[1:33:05] and to the
[1:33:06] [Music]
[1:33:07] going to
[1:33:09] live the
[1:33:11] way
[1:33:13] he
[1:33:14] wants me
[1:33:16] to live
[1:33:18] i'm going to give
[1:33:22] until there's just
[1:33:25] no
[1:33:26] more to give
[1:33:29] i'm going to
[1:33:32] love love till there's just no
[1:33:41] i could never
[1:33:44] never
[1:33:45] [Music]
[1:33:50] there's not a scripture in the bible
[1:33:52] that says you have to outlove him
[1:33:55] scripture says to love him
[1:33:58] that's all he asks
[1:34:00] but he also says you demonstrate your
[1:34:02] love for him by how you love others
[1:34:05] you know there's there's so many things
[1:34:06] that people do and
[1:34:08] sometimes you might look at
[1:34:10] different religions and and what they
[1:34:12] will do to sacrifice and honor to their
[1:34:15] god
[1:34:16] and you look at yourself and man i'm i'm
[1:34:18] nowhere close to that you know i would
[1:34:21] but god didn't ask for that
[1:34:23] he said
[1:34:24] love me
[1:34:26] love my word but demonstrate it on how
[1:34:28] you treat others how you love others let
[1:34:31] your life be
[1:34:33] something that would others would say i
[1:34:35] want
[1:34:35] what you have
[1:34:37] and
[1:34:39] a little bit that i do know of brother
[1:34:41] dan evans and some that he's gone
[1:34:43] through
[1:34:44] we've had some conversations and it's um
[1:34:48] it's got to be a battle for them it's
[1:34:50] got to be a real battle
[1:34:52] but god has a way to get
[1:34:53] to his children
[1:34:55] sometimes when i think there's no hope i
[1:34:57] think of the prodigal son
[1:35:00] and the father who waited for him
[1:35:03] and all the neighbors saw the prodigal
[1:35:05] son coming up to the father and boy were
[1:35:07] their tongues going look at him look at
[1:35:10] him look at him but the father was
[1:35:12] looking at his son and said here comes
[1:35:14] my son that's all they concerned
[1:35:17] so i appreciate god speaking to us
[1:35:20] and i didn't
[1:35:22] talk to brother dan and
[1:35:24] but the lord had given me some
[1:35:25] scriptures today possibly for sunday
[1:35:29] with a thought there's a people on this
[1:35:31] earth who is going to do that
[1:35:33] who is going to be that
[1:35:35] and mary said be it unto me
[1:35:38] according to thy word
[1:35:40] and it was shall how many would say that
[1:35:42] lord be it unto me according to your
[1:35:44] word amen whatever it takes
[1:35:47] so
[1:35:47] [Music]
[1:35:49] make me
[1:35:52] more likely
[1:35:58] jesus
[1:36:00] make me
[1:36:02] more
[1:36:03] like thee
[1:36:05] [Applause]
[1:36:06] [Music]
[1:36:10] me
[1:36:11] a
[1:36:12] heart that's
[1:36:15] filled with me
[1:36:19] and
[1:36:20] make me more
[1:36:24] likely one more time
[1:36:33] [Music]
[1:36:41] make me
[1:36:42] more
[1:36:44] like
[1:36:50] give me
[1:36:54] that's
[1:36:56] filled with love
[1:36:59] and
[1:37:01] make me
[1:37:03] more
[1:37:04] like
[1:37:10] lord we thank you for your word today
[1:37:13] taking a brother lord and he just
[1:37:15] surrendered his heart to you and
[1:37:18] let you use his
[1:37:19] vocal cords lordos
[1:37:21] as we heard and listen lord
[1:37:24] to remind us
[1:37:26] that the honest truth of it all it's god
[1:37:29] christ in us
[1:37:30] the hope of glory
[1:37:32] it's not a work we could do it's not a a
[1:37:35] performance we could
[1:37:37] could do if if there's a hundred million
[1:37:39] angels worshiping you in perfection lord
[1:37:43] what more would you need
[1:37:45] but you want a people who
[1:37:47] who out of their heart
[1:37:50] would love you
[1:37:52] but it just it touches your heart lord
[1:37:54] jesus
[1:37:55] want to be part of that group
[1:37:57] i believe
[1:37:59] the children of god are part of that
[1:38:00] group and some maybe haven't recognized
[1:38:02] it but lord may we come to that
[1:38:04] recognition lord
[1:38:05] that it's christ in us the hope of glory
[1:38:08] lord
[1:38:09] bless each one that is heard lord may
[1:38:11] their hearts be stirred
[1:38:13] and may we take more time to be
[1:38:14] conscious and aware and to talk to you
[1:38:17] and let you speak to us
[1:38:19] every day lord jesus
[1:38:21] we ask it in jesus christ's name
[1:38:23] amen
[1:38:25] some of the most
[1:38:27] wonderful times i've had is just in the
[1:38:29] quietness
[1:38:31] where you just ask god a question in
[1:38:33] prayer
[1:38:34] and then he comes down and he answers it
[1:38:37] in a way you
[1:38:39] you wouldn't think he would
[1:38:41] but he's done some marvelous things
[1:38:43] sitting in my work van one day and
[1:38:47] i was just talking to the lord at lunch
[1:38:50] and a little whirlwind came up and the
[1:38:51] palo verde trees had all been dropping
[1:38:53] their leaves
[1:38:55] and it picked them up coming down the
[1:38:57] street in the subdivision and made a
[1:38:59] little bouquet of them
[1:39:01] and came around my van
[1:39:03] and then went along
[1:39:06] nobody else would know but i had just
[1:39:08] asked the lord are you mindful of me
[1:39:11] and he does simple thing but sometimes
[1:39:13] we get a little too busy
[1:39:15] and we miss what god's going to do so
[1:39:17] keep my heart tender lord keep my head
[1:39:19] in tune right i pray amen
[1:39:21] god bless you lord willing we'll meet
[1:39:23] sunday morning
[1:39:25] see what the lord bring your lick of
[1:39:26] fire bring your here you know a true
[1:39:29] minister will say you know i know what
[1:39:30] the lord has placed in my heart but the
[1:39:32] drawing of the of the congregation the
[1:39:35] body parts that need some some some
[1:39:38] some of this and this vitamin and god
[1:39:41] begins to feed god begins to sense
[1:39:44] he's mindful of us so

[1:43:10] be sensitive
[1:43:12] remember that that lady in the bottom of
[1:43:14] the ship was asking for some fruit
[1:43:17] and god used the unbeliever to deliver
[1:43:19] the fruit
[1:43:20] because god chose to do it that way
[1:43:23] and so she's praising god for and he
[1:43:25] said to bill it was me that gave me the
[1:43:27] fruit and she goes well god has to use
[1:43:29] the devil to do it he'll do it that way
[1:43:30] too so
[1:43:32] well let's just believe god lord i know
[1:43:34] you're mindful of me
[1:43:35] god bless you
