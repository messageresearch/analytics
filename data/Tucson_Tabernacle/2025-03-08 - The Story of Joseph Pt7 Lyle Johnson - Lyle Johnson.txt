worship some more thank you thank you so much well good evening and welcome back to our Wednesday night bible study we're continuing tonight our series on the life of Joseph and some of the lessons it holds for us this evening is part seven we'll see some amazing evidence from secular history this evening that ties in perfectly with Joseph's life and activities told in the Genesis account that we'll be reading together before we resume our study let's Jo Jo together one more time in prayer Lord Jesus it's such an honor it's a privilege to join together with our Brothers and Sisters in Christ just to worship you to acknowledge your blessings in our lives Lord we thank you for your word Lord we thank you for the lessons that it holds for us Lord and we just pray Lord that you'd reveal more of yourself to us this evening Lord that you just help us to draw closer to you and to one another Lord that that we can serve one another in love Lord and just manifesting that love of Christ that's shed abroad in our hearts Lord forgive us Lord forgive me where I've fallen short so many times today I know I've disappointed you Lord but forgive me Lord set those things aside Lord and let things be said this evening that will help and Lord let nothing be said that would hinder we thank you in Jesus precious name amen for our opening verses I'd like to read from two places in Genesis the first is chapter 12 verses 1-3 now the Lord had said to Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee and I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name Great Thou shalt sh be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curses thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed and the next few verses are from Genesis chapter 45 part of Joseph's words when he identified himself to his brothers it was part of our Study last week Genesis 45 at verse 4 excuse me and Joseph said unto his Brethren come near to me I pray you I I I pray you the the the Hebrew word is n it often is translated as please but in the case of a command or an imperative it it softens it it's not so strident it's not so absolute so he's not commanding them to come near or else but he's insisting that they come and they came near and they're troubled troubled that his presence this strange forbidding Egyptian man and he said I am Joseph your brother this is a complete shock this Egyptian Noble whom they partied with the previous day not only speaks their Hebrew dialect but claims to be their brother Joseph what and in the same breath he reminds them your brother whom ye sold into Egypt at this Reuben must have looked at his brothers and seen their guilt-filled countenance filled with fear if this guy really is Joseph and has the power he clearly has as zaf a pan this might not be good news at all Joseph goes on to reassure them of his good intentions toward them now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that she sold me here for I have not forgotten but I have forgiven why because I've come to realize God did send me before you to preserve life Joseph knows his role for these two years hath the famine been in the land and yet the there are five years still to come in the which there shall be neither earring nor Harvest you think it's been bad for these two years it's even worse it's coming and God sent me ahead of you he repeats this emphasizing to them he recognizes that what they did God used it was God's doing and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh we talked about this in part four that senusret 2 who had the dreams died about the time the years of plenty ended s set three his son who had been tutored by Joseph for several years was now Pharaoh made me father to pharaoh and Lord of all his house and ruler throughout all the land of Egypt haste ye go up to my father say to him thus saith thy son Joseph God hath made me Lord of all Egypt come down unto me T not don't delay please be seated the story of Joseph is taken us from his birth in padanaram in in Syria his move as a young child about six years old to Canaan his dreams at age 17 and the treachery of his brothers selling him into slavery at that age he was purchased by potier the captain of Pharaoh's guard we followed him as he learned all about agricultural practice in Egypt on the plantation of potier we saw him rise in responsibility to become what we would call the Chief Operating Officer to potier taking care of all those properties all his businesses he avoided the advances of Mrs P and ended up in the viip Detention Center called The Roundhouse on Piper's estate soon he was running it he correctly interpreted two dreams of Pharaoh's attendance the chief Baker and chief cup Bearer later couple of years later this Pharaoh Senor shet 2 had dreams and Joseph was summoned to interpret them predicting a period of bumper crops followed by a year of severe and lengthy famine he was put in charge of the country to prepare things for the oncoming famine and just as the famine began the Pharaoh died and was succeeded by his son senusret 3 whom Joseph had tutored he left Joseph in charge of things we also saw that during the 22 years since Joseph had been betrayed by his brothers Judah fled to Canaan was married met with personal tragedies that mirrored those of his father Jacob as he was about to commit a highness crime Judas saw himself for what he had become publicly confessed his shortcomings he repented returned home to Hein the famine hit Canaan Jacob's 10 oldest Sons were sent to Egypt to purchase grain they had to see a Stern forbidding powerful man named zafaf pinea he was their brother Joseph but they didn't recognize him he sent them back to Canaan with grain and their money and with a warning that they would never see him again and thus never buy more food unless they brought their brother Benjamin he kept Simeon in prison as a hostage until they returned when the brothers returned and reported to Jacob he refused to let Benjamin go to Egypt but they ran out of food the famine continued finally Judah persuaded his dad to send Benjamin with them and Judah would take full responsibility for his safe return we saw this is a very different Judah they went to Egypt Joseph brought them to his Mansion they had an all day all night party though they still didn't know who he was he then arranged a deception to have them leave Benjamin with him Judah intervened and his impassioned plea caused Joseph to reveal his true identity to them as we just read a portion of he explained their treachery was really the means god used to send him to Egypt and prepare things so they all could survive the famine God even used the ishmaelites their sworn enemies he sent them home with Pharaoh SES threat three active participation and blessing to bring their families and his dad Jacob to him in Egypt they returned to heon and Canaan and had to face the consequences of the truth coming out exposing their deception regarding Joseph having been killed 23 years prior finally they gathered up all their stuff their animals their families let's pick up the story now at chapter 46 and Israel took his journey with all that he had and came to Barba and offered sacrifices under the god of his father Isaac we we see that's short distance it's only 20 miles or so 25 miles why did he stop at BBA did something happened there in Jacob's past that would make him want to stop his journey so soon and offer sacrifices it's a form of worship let's take a moment and look during a previous famine Jacob's grandfather Abram went to Egypt there's no comment in the scripture if God told him to go or even if he asked God if he should go we're only told that God said Abram go to Canaan and Abram went to Canaan and and kept going to Egypt and in Egypt he used deception it's a family trait I think he used deception to survive Jacob may have been having some second thoughts about deception after learning about Joseph and what his sons had done and deceiving him Jacob's dad Isaac during a subsequent famine was tempted to go to Egypt God told him not to Genesis 26 we read there was a famine in the land besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham and Isaac went unto aimc King of the Philistines unto guar now Abraham also went to a fellow named ailec but aimc is not a name it's a title like Pharaoh so it's not the same guy that somehow was a couple of hundred years old and God appeared unto Isaac and said go not down into Egypt dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of so Isaac stayed in guer in fact he's the only one one of the Abraham Isaac and Jacob Trio that never left the promised land he us the same deception Abraham had used in Egypt claiming his wife was his sister after some time had passed he was asked to please leave gar and he Isaac along with his wife Rebecca went up from then gar and an intermediate stop to berseba where he settled the Lord appeared unto him the same night that Isaac came to Bersa and said I am the god of Abraham thy father fear not I am with thee and will bless thee and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake he's confirming the promise he'd made to Abraham that we read in our opening verses and Isaac built an altar there and called upon the name of the Lord and pitched his tent there and there Isaac's servants died a well and there they dwelt bersheba is almost certainly where Jacob deceived Esau for the birthright and it is there that Jacob partnered with his mom Rebecca and deceived Isaac for the blessing of the firstborn it's where the family lived when Jacob fled for his life from Esau Genesis 27:41 we read Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father Isaac blessed him and Esau said in his heart the days of mourning for my father are at hand then I'm going to kill my brother Jacob not empty phrases he's talking about literal murder and we read Jacob went out from Beersheba and went toward haran now Jacob's beloved Son Joseph is telling him dad leave the promised land come to Egypt to survive yet another famine should he go as he starts out from heon the road leads through Beba the place where his deceptions began where he did so wrong he is now tasting the fruit of deception having mourned his son Joseph for 23 years you can sort of hear him thinking maybe i' better start acting like Israel and not like Jacob so he decides to ask God for direction always a good idea when you have a decision to make fork in the road a corner to turn sometimes you get a clear answer go to Egypt other times you get an answer that's clear but not what you expected just walk okay I don't know where I'm going but you said walk so I'm walking brother bradam tells about that story in Memphis Tennessee at other times it seems you get no answer at all you have to trust and move forward returning to our story Israel took his journey with all that he had came to beeba and offered sacrifices unto the god of his father Isaac probably on the very altar where the sight of its remains that Isaac had built several decades earlier offering sacrifices was an expression of worship and God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night and said Jacob Jacob and he said he Hebrew it means here am I it's always a good answer God calls you stop here am I and God said I am God the god of thy father Isaac fear not to go down into Egypt for there I will make of thee a great nation your descendants will be there for many years become a numerous people continuing to confirm the promise he made to Abram and he had renewed to Isaac as we read earlier furthermore I will go down with thee into Egypt and I will also surely bring thee up again referring to both Jacob the individual and the nation that he has just said would become in Egypt and Joseph shall put his hand upon shall close Thine Eyes in other words Jacob you'll die there Joseph will close your eyes you'll return in a casket you live out your remaining days in Egypt and Jacob now having his answer from God rose up from Beersheba and the sons of Israel that's Jacob carried Jacob their father and their little ones and their wives in the carts which Pharaoh had sent to carry him and they took their cattle and their goods which they had gotten in the land of Canaan and came into Egypt Jacob and all his extended family with him his sons and his son's Sons with him his daughters implying he had more than one daughter not only Dina and his sons daughters and all his descendants brought he with him into Egypt and these are the names of the children of Israel which came into Egypt I won't read the list of names some names are left out the names of his daughters-in-law and in fact all the females traveling with them with the possible exceptions of Dina bilha and zilpa are left out the math is challenging to say the least skipping to verse 26 all the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt which came out of his loins besides Jacob's sons wives all the souls were three score and six that's 66 and the sons of Joseph which were born in Egypt were two Souls all the souls of the House of Jacob which came into Egypt were three score and 10 that's 70 we'll just accept the stated numbers and Jacob sent Judah ahead of him unto Joseph to direct Jacob's face to Goan I'm coming to another fork in the road which way do I turn and they the extended family group came into the land of Goan and Joseph made ready his Chariot as how it's translated cart I think would be more accurate a couple of lessons ago I showed an image of a chariot from the tomb of King Tut at the time of Joseph a chariot or a cart would have had solid Wheels not lightweight spooked wheels and again we have no illustrations or examples from this period after Joseph's era in the Middle Kingdom and before moses' time in the New Kingdom Egypt would be conquered by a mysterious people called the hixus and one of the weapons that gave the hixus great advantage over the Egyptians was their spoke wheel chariots and Joseph went up to meet Israel his father to Goan and presented himself unto him what a reunion and he fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while and you say well who does that he refer to brother Lyle I think it refers to both of them I think Joseph fell on his dad's neck and I think his dad fell on Joseph's neck and wept a good while at last they can cry all the pent up emotion and hurt turmoil and confusion pain and grief can be released for both of them it's a time where a wound becomes a scar the difference of course I I had some material removed from my body some chunk taken off a few weeks ago and I had to be careful how I slept because it hurt it it was a wound but now it's a scar it doesn't hurt anymore we've got past the period of healing these guys are having a time of healing and Israel said unto Joseph now let me die since I have seen thy face because Thou Art yet alive and Joseph said unto his Brethren and unto his father's house I will go up and show pharaoh and say unto him my brethren and my father's house which were in the land of Canaan are come unto me and the men are Shepherds for their trade hath been to feed cattle and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have and and it shall come to pass when Pharaoh shall call you and shall say what is your occupation it's not so like today it's not who are you but what do you do for a living well when he asks you that she shall say thy servant's trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now both we and also our fathers that she may dwell in the land of Goan for every Shepherd is an Abomination to the Egyptians Joseph is his father's son and he's a skilled politician he knows what to say and what to not say what to leave out since you raised cattle and sheep just admit to the cattle no need to tell them you also kept sheep it's enough that your hairy smelly Hebrew Hillbillies don't make things more difficult by telling sesr 3 that you uh take care of sheep then Joseph came and told pharaoh and said my father and my brethren and their flocks and their herds and all the they have are come out of the land of Canaan and behold they are in the land of Goan and Joseph took some of his Brethren even five unnamed men and presented them unto pharaoh and Pharaoh said unto Joseph's Brethren what's your occupation and they said unto Pharaoh thy servants are Shepherds both we and also our father fathers Joseph we've learned our lesson about deception and hiding truth he's going to find out where Shepherds when his men report back to him about our flocks who brought with us let's just deal with it now they said moreover to Pharaoh for to sojourn in the land are we come for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks for the famine is soore in the land of Canaan now therefore we pray thee please let thy servants dwell in the land of Goan we understand that's your intent anyway but we want you to know we're grateful and we'd love to stay where you have provided for us and Pharaoh spake unto Joseph saying thy father and thy Brethren are come unto thee the land of Egypt is before Thee the best of the land make thy father and Brethren to dwell in the land of Goan let them dwell if thou knowest any men of activity among them then make them rulers over my cattle it's kind of a strange turn of phrase other translations say in effect if uh any of your brothers are competent or skilled or have ability or are otherwise capable put them in charge of my cattle and as we'll see Pharaoh had immense herds of cattle to manage but the egyp Egyptian stereotype was that Hebrews sematic people in general were lazy incompetent and unskilled in addition to being bearded hairy and smelly anti-Semitism is nothing new we see it here 4 thousand years ago but uh hey Joseph if you're a smart guy and you cleaned up pretty well maybe one of your brothers is not the typical Hebrew either maybe and Joseph J brought in Jacob his father and set him before pharaoh and Jacob blessed pharaoh and Pharaoh probably taking a good look at him said unto Jacob how old are you and Jacob said unto Pharaoh the days of the years of my pilgrimage or 130 years few and evil have the days of the years of my life been and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers and the days of their pilgrimage now let me assure you they were old and Jacob blessed pharaoh and went out from before pharaoh and Joseph placed his father and his Brethren and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt in the best of the land in the land of ramesis as Pharaoh had commanded ramisis this is a word that is again used to question when Joseph was in Egypt the first pharaohs named ramisis were in the New Kingdom around 1300 BC more than 500 years after Joseph ramisis is a name meaning raah the son God has fashioned him it it's POS possible an area of Goan being the best land was called this in the Middle Kingdom Period this is so good the son God must have just created this we don't know that if the Exodus occurred around 1446 BC it was about 150 years before the Pharaoh rameses 1 who reigned in the 1290s it's possible that a region or sub region of Goan was known by this name in Moses time Moses is the fellow that wrote Genesis but it is more likely that the Scribe copying Moses writings or a copy of such writings inserted the name ramisis to make the location clearer to the readers of his time not changing but clarifying likewise the name of Pome which appears in the book of Exodus there's no evidence either way we don't have a copy of Genesis older than the Dead Sea Scrolls and those were some 1500 years after Moses the text is clear however that pharaoh said Goan and so did Joseph and Joseph nourished his father and his Brethren and all his family's household with bread grained from the storehouses according to their families there was no bread in all the land for the famine was very sore so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine here we see another model of Christ Joseph is taking care of his family Joseph is bearing the entire cost his motivation is love it's at a time of a Great Famine part of the scriptures our pastor brought last Sunday morning Paul wrote in Romans 8 who or what shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress pers persecution famine nakedness Peril sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels or principalities or powers or things present or things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord and we think of the words of Amos and of our own time Amos 811 behold the days come sayeth the Lord that I will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but of hearing the words of the Lord and they shall Wander from sea to Sea and from the north even to the east they shall run to and fro and seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it but it is our Lord who sends his word and sustains us as Joseph sustained his family brother brandham often referred to this in the last days it would be a famine for hearing the word of God well now let's look at Joseph in a slightly different role Joseph the master Publican the famine was very sore so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine and Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the grain which they bought and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house picture this the Grain and storage was collected as a tax on the land you may recall this model from uh part two I think in addition Joseph had developed the fiume Basin he stored the grain during such Plenty when wheat was cheap now the people were starving he sold the grain back to them it was scarce so the price was no longer cheap economics 101 right money at that time was precious metal measured by weight didn't matter whose mint it was from it was silver or gold by weight it wasn't printed paper or IUS or waving your ey stone at the cash register but there's only so much silver and gold it's why we have Federal Reserve notes in our day and are transitioning to electronic transfer when I was a kid there were silver certificates as well as Federal Reserve notes but in the early 1960s the government demoted the silver certificates and set a date after which they were no longer going to be accepted in trade for silver so it says silver certificate it says $1 in silver payable to the bearer on demand and they said we're just kidding after such such and such a day we're not doing that anymore I I remember when several people I knew during the last week or so of redemption in the 1960s they they drove from where we lived in San Jose to the mint in San Francisco to redeem their silver certificats for silver had they done that before the famine they could have got some grain in Egypt when money failed in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan all the Egyptians came unto Joseph and said give us bread why should we die in thy presence why should we starve to death money's gone it failed there is no money you have all of it all the silver all the gold how can we buy Grain Joseph didn't extend credit he didn't make loans instead Joseph said give me your cattle and I'll give you grain for your cattle if you don't have any money give me your livestock so they brought their cattle unto Joseph and Joseph gave them bread grain in exchange for horses and flocks and cattle of the herds and for the asses he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that Year good thing he was taking care of his family or the brothers fear from our last session that Joseph wanted their donkeys might have come true true when that first year of the famine was ended they came to Joseph the second year and said unto him we'll not hide it from my Lord our money's gone my Lord also hath our herds of cattle there's not a there's nothing left in the sight of my Lord but but our bodies and our lands why should we die before your eyes well both we and our land buy us and our land for bread and we in our land will be servants slaves unto pharaoh and give us seed that we may live and not die that the land be not desolate this is the time of the brother's second visit they saw Z apan was making slaves of everyone and getting all their livock so their fears that he's going to make us slaves and steal our donkeys had some basis Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh ad includes Goan for the Egyptians sold every man his field because the famine prevailed over them so the land became pharaohs and as for the people he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof with neither earring nor Harvest no point in working the lands along the Nile easier to keep and feed and employ people in cities than in rural areas only the land of the priests bought he not for the priests had a portion of grain assigned them of pharaoh and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them wherefore they sold not their lands then Joseph said unto the people behold I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh Lo here's seed for you you shall seow the land in the future after the years of Dr are finished and it shall come to pass in the increase at Harvest time that you shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh you remember that 10% tax it's 20% and four parts shall be your own for seed of the field and for your food and for them of your households and for food for your little ones sorry I got behind here by and they said thou Hast saved Our Lives let us find Grace in the sight of my Lord and we will be Pharaoh's servants will be your slaves and Joseph made it a law over all the land of Egypt unto this day the time of Moses some 450 years later that Pharaoh should have the fifth part 20 % except the land of the priests only which became not pharaohs are you ready for a little break in the story with a a little history sidebar the correct answer is yes oh okay well here we go thank you you may recall from part three of this series that under Senor threet 2 the one who had the dreams I mentioned that he was known for having good relations with the nomarchs uh these were the regional rulers or Governors some of whom were nearly as powerful as pharaoh and I know you can't see that but all those little dots on there represent nark areas so there was I don't know 45 or 50 of them I forgotten the number and didn't look it up and that Joseph was in prison during the white space between chapters 40 and 41 after he interpreted the dreams of the Butler and Baker in that interval before sence thre 2 had his dreams Joseph learned the protocol of the Court found out who was in the list of powerful men in Egypt at that time God Was preparing him for his upcoming audience with the Pharaoh and his subsequent service I also mentioned in part four and answer to some questions from young people in the audience that senet died about the time of the end of the years of plenty his son senusret 3 took the throne at the onset of the years of famine 1878 BC senusret 3 is known in history as the pharaoh who destroyed the power of the nomarchs by the end of his reign the narks were no longer a major force in Egyptian politics this is from secular history secular history doesn't recognize Joseph doesn't recognize the truth that's contained here in Genesis but they align from Wikipedia we read Senus threet 3 ruled from 1878 BC the year we deriv from the Bible is the transition from the 7 years of plenty to the seven years of famine in part four he ruled from 1878 to 1839 BC during a time of great power and prosperity he was the fifth King of the 12th dynasty of the Middle Kingdom he was a great pharoh with the 12th Dynasty considered to rule at the height of the Middle Kingdom thank you Joseph his military campaigns gave rise to an Era of peace and economic Prosperity that reduced the power of the regional rulers the nomarchs and led to a Revival in craft workk and trade got to do something to be productive while the land lays valow and a Revival in Urban Development we just read that Joseph moved them into the cities in verse 21 It just fits together if you studied this sort of thing in school or or just because you were curious about the world we live in and its history you may have asked well s you thre three well how did he do that and we just read the answer the Nars were impoverished during the famine and had to surrender their Estates their land and their wealth to Pharaoh this made SES threat 3 an incredibly powerful man and it was thanks to Joseph no wonder Pharaoh was willing to tolerate the Hebrew Hillbillies and Goan and now that he owned all the land except for the temples of the priests and their surrounding Estates Goan was his to do with as he wished letting Joseph's family settle there was a small gift to acknowledge the man who made sesr 3 perhaps the richest and most powerful person known at that time there's another piece of secular history that ties into all of this s thre 3 was also known for his military conquests and his exploits but these didn't happen until the eighth year of his Reign he carried out at least four major campaigns into Nubia that's South when you head in Egypt you head upriver you're going south and the Nubians were at the border there and they uh they didn't really recognize the border so much four major campaigns into Nubia in his years the years of his reign of pharaoh years 8 10 16 and 19 year eight his year eight Stella it's a engraved Stone year eight that's the year after the famine ended this year 8 Stella at semna documents his victories against the Nubians through which he is thought to have made safe the Southern frontier preventing further incursions into Egypt raids during the famine ever wonder why he waited till year eight maybe because his army was busy guarding and distributing the grain during the famine and protecting Egypt during its weakness from both famine and political upheaval due to consolidation of power from Nars who didn't want to give up their power my friends God's word is true even the Rocks the inscribed Stones known as Stella declare it enough history back to Joseph and Israel Joseph's dad dwelt in the land of Egypt in the country of Goan and they had possessions therein and grew and multiplied exceedingly and Jacob lived in the land of Egypt 17 years so the whole age of Jacob was 147 years five years of those were during the continued famine with Joseph consolidating things under and four the Pharaoh SES 3 and then 12 years of relatively normal agricultural production while SES thre 3 is launching military campaigns to secure Egypt Southern frontier and to secure his legacy and the time Drew near that Israel Jacob must die and he called his son Joseph and said unto him if now I I have found Grace in thy sight a little dry son if now I have found Grace in thy sight put I I pray thee thy hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly with me Bury Me Not I pray thee in Egypt but I will lie with my fathers Thou shalt carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying place and Joseph said I will do as thou Hast said and Israel said swear unto me and he swear unto him and Israel bowed himself on the bed's head I want to give you a very short preview of our final part part eight Next Time chapter 48 will be a surprising development when Joseph brings his two sons to see their grandfather God willing will also touch on part of the realization of what happens in that chapter chapter 49 is Israel's blessings on his 12 sons or is it 14 and it records the death of Jacob chapter 50 concludes the Book of Genesis we'll see the honors accorded Jacob by Pharaoh Senus thre 3 we'll see the Brothers still concerned about Joseph taking Vengeance on them for their betrayal of him than 40 years earlier we'll learn of Joseph's death extracting a promise of his extended family similar to the promise we just read of Israel extracting from Joseph and the book closes with a dramatic comparison of its opening and closing lines and just as I think about it at at this particular moment uh for those of you that aren't familiar the back by the AV Booth I've got a single sheet that has some of the images we've used and a list of all the verses if you want to take them home and and uh review things what lessons can we take home from from this part of the story of Joseph years ago there was an advertising slogan used by army recruiters and it's coming back be all you can be in the Army and the life of Joseph I think we can rephrase this a bit be all God made you to be and don't allow yourself to limit him sold into slavery Joseph set his sights on the estate mansion to be Piper's Chief Operating Officer for a slave that's the Pinnacle but from God's perspective Joseph's sights were way too low along the path serving in the Mansion Joseph learned all the physical labor aspects of the plantation how to get best shield for the crops low-level management and so forth in the Mansion Joseph learned how to be invisible among the elite how they conducted themselves at the parties and dinners and whatnot that Piper undoubtedly threw during those years he learned that misunderstandings happen sometimes we might say no good deed goes unpunished with doing the right thing regarding Mrs P for which she landed in the VIP holding tank surely this was a huge step down but there in the white space between chapters 40 and 41 Joseph learned about the power structure in the Kingdom where loyalties lay who could be trusted who could not all the ins and outs of Royal politics and governance then Joseph was catapulted from the dungeon to the second spot in the superpower of the day Egypt he didn't sit on the throne but he wielded the power and authority of the throne when the famine hit he fully realized why God had put him in the place he was Joseph then had to confront the ones who had tormented him in the first place he had to see what he himself was really made of Joseph had to forgive what he could not forget and save those who had tried to destroy him musicians would would please return Jesus said this as he was preparing to go on his final journey to Jerusalem Luke 17 he said take heed to yourselves If thy brother trespass against thee rebuke him but if he repent forgive him if he Tres to pass against thee seven times in a day and seven times in a day turn again to thee saying I Repent Thou shalt forgive him and just after this perhaps seeking clarification we read in Matthew Peter came to him and said uh now l get this straight Lord how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him seven times Jesus said unto him I say not unto thee until seven times but until 70 times seven how often does our father forgive us our life in Christ isn't just about words attitudes as brother Daniel ministered recently as includes service investing in each other in James 2 we read if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food one of you say unto them depart in peace be warm have a belly full notwithstanding you don't give them those things that they need what good is that even so faith if it doesn't do anything is dead being alone as we close this portion of tonight's service I can't help but think of the message of love and grace so perfectly Illustrated in the life of Joseph and fulfilled in the life of Jesus let's sing together a song marvelous Grace it's a hymn that was written about 115 years ago containing some of these Timeless truths m marvelous grace of our loveing Lord Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt y on calary Mount [Music] outpour there where the blood of

[Music] sin I suppose there's not many men in history that knew Grace more than Joseph did I was amazed brother L was telling the story and Joseph took taxes on all the grain that the people produced they brought them in he he took the Grain and then when the famine hit and the grain ran out he sold it back to the ones that produced it and then when they couldn't pay he took their land and yet God was with him sometimes we don't understand God's ways but God used it to save all of Egypt let's all let's all stand jiah God will make a way where there seems to be no way he works in ways we cannot see he will make a way for me he will be my God hold me closely to his with love and strength for each new day he will make God will make a way oh God Will Make Way seems to be no way he works in ways

of the Bible and spend some time going through that character I spoke the other day on um this was a few weeks ago on the story of the prodigal son and I just think of Joseph seeing his dad come back as brother l was saying and how much it meant to him to see his his dad and his family return is there a prodigal way back there in the back brother Jonathan is that you oh my brother I couldn't see
