TRANSCRIPT
========================================
open in a word of prayer let's sing verse two again we were like that little girl dead in all our sins till Jesus touched This Heart of Mine gave me life again I am just a house of clay ever since that blessed day there's a light that shines shes on me for all the world to see oh he's in this house death has to flee now there is a light where Darkness used to be and now there is hope there's no more doubt PR his name praise His name he's in the house oh death death has to flee now there is life where Darkness used to be and now there is hope there's no more doubt praise His name praise His name he's in the house he's in the house amen Amen brother Josiah mentioned that the Lord is here he's right here I thought about the word omnipresence and omnipresent and we ascribe that to the Lord that he's everywhere and I searched there in the Bible and I don't think that word exactly is there in the Bible but there was another one of omni and I just thought that this was a good thing to think on this morning Revelations 19: 5-7 says and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our God all ye his servants and ye that fear Him both small and great I think all of us can say some of us may feel like we're small some might feel in our own way great but we can all say both small and great can Praise Him and I heard as it were V the voice of a great multitude as the voice of many Waters and as the voice of Mighty thundering saying Allelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready amen we just want to be ready for his soon coming amen we have a few prayer requests turned in this morning brother Aron get is at home he's not feeling well so let's just remember

son Nathan and Stephanie and their children so let's just remember them all in prayer one other request from Brother Andy kangi from South Africa he asks that we pray for his business he's going through a difficult time I'm sure we all have a need that we can make known an unspoken need with an uplifted hand let's go to the Lord in prayer this morning Lord as we just read Lord in your word you're omnipotent Lord the dictionary I think says that means all powerful Lord and it said it it usually ascribes it to God lord and we know that you're all powerful to be able to take care of every need that we have Lord every desire Lord your word says Delight thyself in the Lord and you will give us the desires of our heart Lord so we know that you're powerful and can take care of everything Lord every need every desire if that's good Lord you can meet that need and that desire Lord you can give us a good service this morning Lord even with our shortcomings maybe we come to church tired

you with the two scriptures that were read before service I don't know if I have anything to add at all weren't those great the psalm that brother Josiah read and then then uh Revelation I believe is chapter 19 that brother Jordan read two very very encouraging scriptures with with a lot of Promise in them God bless you it's um brother Ron son there God bless you welcome from Houston Texas it's good to have you welcome brother brother Ron came a few months ago it's baptized and and uh he's continuing on with with this gospel that that has become so dear to his heart and it's seems seeing him now it seems like it is just growing and growing God bless you greet sister Lori for us it's it's good to have you my my my cousin um Stephen Martin is here he's uh not only he's my cousin he's a good friend brother Stephen raise your hand back there take a look at him he's he uh there there's a dominant gene in our family and I bet you can't guess what it is Stephen we're we're we're uh we're a bit short on the Jean Pool on the top of our head but we make up for it in our facial hair God bless you brother um Stephen is is a is a hero he's a war veteran from the Iraq War and and's he's been around the world fighting for our country and uh and fighting for the def defense of our country now he's retired but brother Stephen it's it's no longer your job to fight for the defense of our country but now brother it's time to fight for the Salvation of our country yeah I always admired someone that has served in the armed forces and served our country and uh Stephen and and his his brother have are really they are they're war heroes they were in the thick of it and I always admired that and now I feel that Lord let me be on a battlefield and not so much the battlefield of flesh and blood but the battlefield of this gospel saving Souls winning souls to the Lord Jesus and that's that's the battle that I want to be fighting and I am going to Stephen I'm going to be a warrior in that battle until the day I die by the grace of God and you need to also my brother win those Souls take that that servitude that you did for our country and now place it into something that's more important this country is going to fail eventually but this gospel will never fail brothers and sisters if we can fight for for the Salvation of a soul for the Salvation of this country it'll never end and the progress that we make will be for all eternity what a what a thought and we're on the battlefield every day for the kingdom of God the Kingdom of Heaven winning winning souls and and showing them that Jesus Christ is alive he's not just alive in this book but he's alive right here in me I want I want to show everywhere I go I want to say you want to meet the Lord Jesus I have his spirit I want to represent him every place every time I want to and I want to lift him up I believe as we get into this book of James as we get further in that was James's that was his calling that's that's what he did and he did a great job at it remember James doesn't say he was an apostle James was a pastor and he was pastor of this church in Jerusalem he was really the first Christian Pastor that we know of of a church besides the Lord Jesus of course but James was this pastor in and the First Christian Church and the first pastor and you can see as you read through his gospel his his epistle that he addressed things a little bit different than say Paul did and say Peter did he was also he's the half brother of the Lord Jesus so he had some credentials back there and boy did did he make bold statements James he he said some things that that really challenged the people he wasn't like Paul where he was bringing Jesus Christ out of the scriptures and saying now now give your life to him James is is saying hey you've already given your life to Christ you've already become a Christian you're familiar with all of the law and all the prophets and everything that Moses taught now step it up in your life and that was James it's it's tough it it is a tough book probably of all the Epistles this one is the most pointed and the most corrective and it's because he was a pastor Not only was he preaching to his church in this epistle but he's sending this out to all of the Jews that were similar to the people in his congregation and and he's telling all of them hey you know you've accepted Christ that's good now step it up in your life and put to work what he said James let's let's do a little review James chapter 1 verse 19 it says this and this is really the theme of James the second part of James chapter 2 so we started a few weeks ago was James chapter 1 we got through that one then uh two weeks ago we started in James chapter 2 and we got about halfway through and if the Lord's willing I'd like to finish James chapter 2 today but a little background James chapter 1: 19 James says this wherefore my beloved Brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak and slow to wrath if we could we could just stop right there and say yeah that's the one brother Daniel just stop right there and let's just have devote the rest of the service to that but but that's next week we're gonna we're going to tackle that one next week for the wrath of man worketh not right the righteousness of God wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness it's overflowing wickedness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in the glass for he beh holdeth himself and goeth his way and straight way he forgets what manner of man that he was so he's looking in the mirror maybe he's coming to church and he's saying no yeah I need to work on that and you feel really condemned and there's repentance and then you go away and pretty soon you forget the man that you saw in church and those sins that you said I'm going to repent of I'm going to do better those sins just slowly creep back into your life and you forget what you saw when you made a commitment to the Lord to change let's go back to that verse number 22 says but be ye hearers of the word doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves the NIV version says this do not merely listen to the word and so deceive yourselves do what it says and that's the theme for the second part of James chapter 2 so let's go to James chapter 2 verse 14 and we'll pick up where we left off what doth it profit my brethren though a man say he hath faith and have not works can Faith save him so he's saying what good is it to you to have faith if you don't do anything with this Faith what good is it to say that you have faith faith in God and you're not using the faith it's a very bold statement by James he's saying all of these quote Believers and he's saying listen Okay you believe but what are you doing with it it's question we need all ask ourselves and when the bad part of the hard part is so you say Lord I'm going to I'm going to change I'm going to I'm going to put this faith into action and then you start taking steps to be a doer of the word and not a hearer only and then man you open yourself up for criticism you open open yourself up for failure you open yourself up for all kinds of things but don't just sit there because James is condemning you for just sitting there he said go out and try it's like so many people are telling you how are telling the pastors here's how you should run your church here's how you should preach here's what here's the important topics and then it comes down to it it's like well wait brother when did you Pastor a church when when have you started a church and it was successful there a I've had people come to me time and time again and saying what are you doing you're preaching you're you're going back to this this B Bible and you're not preaching the Modern Day message and you're not doing all this and my my answer to them is well brother how many converts do you have and I asked this the other day to a friend how many people have you led to the Lord Jesus oh well um I don't know well you know I've witnessed to a lot of people I've witness to a lot of people but what good did it do where are the fruits of that witness I know this hits hard this is us it should be us all of us should be thinking you know what you know he's kind of right about this you know you're trying to trying to witness to people you're trying to maybe get them to think like you get them to believe like you get them as I say often to act like you to look like you and to just be a clone to you and what good does it do what good has it done and people are always they're they're really quick to point out the flaws and there's going to be flaws everywhere you look right here you're going to see plenty of flaws and you can see plenty of flaws with all of us but and so if you come in looking for those flaws you will find them there was a a brother that came here for a while he was coming here um really first class I I mean I really liked him and he was um he knew his scriptures excellent and he saw us on um on YouTube and and he started coming and he um made this statement he he started giving I mean he gave me plenty of accolades and and said you know I appreciate the pastor and how he preaches the Bible and how how he he just digs into this and it's just the word only for him it's just the Bible only for him well I came from a place that wasn't like that I came a from a place and it was a denomination but he called it a cult he says where they preached the denomination he said they preached the cult and he said but now he says I'm watching you all on YouTube and he says he says I'm coming here to church and he gave testimony to us and he said you he says this is great he said appreciate what you what you have and then he made a statement that you know the whole the there's a flag that goes up he made a statement and he said that I thought I was going to have to start my own church because I couldn't find a place to believe like me or that that took that put these things first forgot his exact words and I was like uh and then a little while later he comes and he starts one service he starts seeing negative he starts seeing things that were wrong he starts seeing things that were said wrong and and there was all that he could handle he got up and he stormed out of church and let me tell you something he was right he was right in some of the things that he was upset with but he had the wrong Spirit he was right in his Doctrine but he was wrong in his heart he was wrong in his spirit and he was and he left and and if if he would have just talked to me if I could have just got a hold of him and said brother listen you're right but let me let's let me show you where we need help but instead forget it I'm leaving but do you think maybe before you leave your church church and maybe the people on that that are streaming in or watch this video before you leave your church do you think maybe you should stop and say how can I help rather than just seeing all the problems and all the the the the stuff associated with it do you think maybe you say well Lord maybe I can help these people are the people more important or are your doctrines more important that's where it should be so before you before you leave your churches and go to another one don't be just looking for your next former Church make a difference in the church that you have now like like Stephen it's time to to get on the battlefield for God and you not you don't fight on the battlefield when there's no there's no enemy right you fight on the battlefield where there's an enemy so stay there work hard show your church show the people that love and and then maybe you might find out whoa whoa whoa actually I was wrong actually my attitude was wrong but when you have the attitude of serving then you'll have a different outcome it's uh there's um there was another guy um another critic of of everybody really and uh there's probably many of you were were in the service not here and he started he he was up there preaching and just really laying it down laying it down hard and I like that I don't have any problem with someone preaching against sin or or or um preaching against mistakes or anything like that wonderful praise the Lord I'm with you but he said he he was up there and he got excited and he said you know he says the people should be lined up outside your your church lined up waiting to be healed there should be hundreds of them lined up there just trying to get in so that they could come in and the Holy Spirit would be so strong and they would be healed man that sounds good that sounds really good but be doers of the word and not hear is only it just happened to know that he has about 20 people in his church and it hasn't grown it's done nothing but shrank so brother why are you telling everyone else but they're not lined up at your church trying to get in to be healed what he said was good but show me the proof and that's what James is saying here he's like hey you talk about you talk about faith without your without works and I'll show you Faith by my works if I have a Ministry and you have a Ministry the best thing that you can do is that you can go to someone one and say Here's what the Lord did for me here's my life here's the changes in my life and you can have the same instead of pointing your finger at everybody saying you change you change you change and you need to do this you need to do all of that it's like whoa whoa whoa well I can look into your life and I can see all kinds of hypocrisy that's right just like this brother that was preaching that it's like wait a minute wait a minute that sounds good but they're not lined up outside of your church and if somebody's going to give me pastoral advice I want to see someone that has done it before I want to see someone that has been through it and that advi advice is something that I can really hold on to and it's all of us your personal testimony brothers and sisters mean means more than all of the words from the pulpit that that we could say I can preach this word and I can read this word but when this word really comes to life that is what our um brother here James is talking about verse number 14 what doth it profit my brethren though a man say he hath faith and have not works can Faith save him so you're a Christian where is your Christianity you tell everyone else how to live their lives but where is Christianity in your life Matthew believe it's Matthew 23 Jesus talks about the Pharisees and he said listen he says do what they say because they're they're saying the truth but don't do what they do because they say and they do not the words of the Lord Jesus Matthew chapter 23 I believe it's verse one 2 and three Christians kind they're they're supposed to be they're supposed to prefer the brother they're supposed to prefer their sister they're supposed to prefer their neighbors but if we are truly living where is your giving where is my giving where is your sacrifice so many people call themselves Christians and say I believe I believe I believe but they're just whistling what seems like whistling through this graveyard of life and they're not really putting into action if a brother or a sister be naked and destitute of daily food and one of you say unto them depart in peace and be ye warmed and filled and filled notwithstanding that you give them not those things which they are needful to the body what doth it profit them so this is 2,000 years ago where where there were people that were genuinely in need I think sometimes we give to those that um that are asking for and sometimes we enable them a little bit more this is a little bit of a different age we still should give to the poor we still should help but be selective in how we're doing it but here he's saying that that if you give if you someone that's asking for food or for a drink or for warmth and you don't give it to them but you just say so you're hungry hey um you're hungry you know what the deal is why don't you go get something to eat yeah thanks no problem you know that's that's good advice and that's what we do and that's what James is saying here he like oh you're hungry well go get something to eat they can't it's a whole reason they're hungry they need food and today it's it's a little bit different it's somebody might say I'm struggling you know I just can't get over I'm hooked on this or or I'm struggling with that and they say well you just got to believe in God brother you just got to have faith sister well yeah I I know that but help me encourage me take your time and give it to that person know you can't just say well you just need to believe most of the time in fact almost every time that's not going to do any good you think that person doesn't already know that they just need to believe help them encourage them take your time or get down on your knees and set aside all of the the distractions of the world and go before that person in in prayer in In fervent prayer Pray for that person you know you can tell them sometimes hey hey I'm praying for you are you really sometimes you don't even need to say it get down on your knees you see someone is is in need and go fervently to prayer for that person I told the story the other day that I was really down and I was really discouraged and it was just in my mind things were going around you know and I was I was frustrated with things and I was I think I was sitting in my den and I'm just struggling like like this is I don't want to do this and and and and very negative attitude and then all of a sudden it just left immediately and I sat back in my chair and I was encouraged literally one second I was discouraged and had a bad attitude the next second I was encouraged and saying we can do this and and and ready to go to battle and I I was thinking what just happened and I believe the Lord laid it on my heart someone Just prayed for you and God heard it and blessed me and the same thing with us don't just tell someone you're praying for them encourage them but do it don't just let it be words Let It Be Works Matthew chap 6:6 Jesus is talking about prayer and he says but thou when thou prayest enter into the closet a Greek word is is is your inner chamber go into a private place and when thou Hast shut thy door pray to thy father who is in secret and thy father who seeth in secret shall reward thee openly what does that mean Amplified version which is a more literal version says this but when you pray go into your most private room close the door and pray to your father who is in secret and your father who sees in secret will reward you so what does that mean that means get in there quiet and then all of a sudden like brother Daniel Evans that that you'll see oh he answered my prayer that person's doing better and it because I went in there in secret I went in quiet I just went me and the Lord and had had nothing to do with anybody else I wasn't trying to draw attention to myself I wasn't trying to lift myself up I I wasn't trying to tell everybody how much I pray or tell this person it was in secret and then God rewarded me openly with the healing of that person or with the encouragement of that person and when someone needs help again don't make it about yourself make it about that person Matthew chapter 9:35 and Jesus went about all the cities and Villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people but when he saw the multitude he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no Shepherd and he's our example he had compassion on these people his compassion his his his vision wasn't to build his own Ministry his own Ministry was there to help these people his burden was for those who needed help and then watch The Works of Christ watch how Faith becomes Works verse 37 then saith he to then saith he unto his disciples the Harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few he's looking out and he says there's so much to do and there's so few that are really willing to do it then he he instructs him he says pray therefore the lord of the Harvest that he will send forth laborers into the Harvest pray not just Jesus wasn't praying Lord exalt my Ministry Jesus was looking out on the people he said oh they need help and he said I pray that God will send soldiers into the battlefield that God will send people to help them and and that's that was his biggest his biggest desire and I know there's a lot of deceivers in the world I know there's there's a lot of of problems as far as as ministers and as far as pastors but look at all the churches and look at all there are many that truly love the people there are many pastors out there that really care about the ones that they are shepherding there's a lot of them and thank God for those people thank God that they really do care and they're they're really I believe they're an answer to Jesus's prayer that God would send these laborers into the fields there was um we we look not not just at at the church but we we look at what's needed and so many times we'll see we'll see like the youth we look at them and say these kids need to straighten up they need to stop looking this way they need to stop talking this way and and and just criticize them but brother sister you can say it but what are you doing to help it's easy to criticize but what are you doing to help the same with the church it's like when are you going to get the chair set up when are you gonna when are you going to get the fellowship all done when are you going to get the windows clean it's like I know I know you could help you could you could do something I mean I know criticism is good and and it sometimes it's Justified but do something the same thing it's like with our spouses those that we love or or or a family member it's like you can criticize what they're doing all you want and you might be justified but what are you doing to help it instead of maybe criticizing my wife maybe I could do something for her maybe I could step up to the place and and say yeah but it's not all about me I want to I want to do like Jesus said and I want to serve her and if we would look at the other person instead of looking at ourselves I say it all the time I'll say it again it ain't about you living a Christian life is about the other person it's about your husband it's about your wife it's about your kids it's about your brother it's about your sister and you look you might get you might get frustrated with them but maybe you could help help a little bit maybe you could help them Philippians chapter 2 it says let not each of you look out only for his own interests but also for the interests of others so we need to stop dwelling on what other people are doing and and how it affects us and then we need to go out and start helping them and you'll see the the most miserable people I think all of us know are the ones that are constantly serving themselves constantly thinking about themselves the happiest people we know and you just judge me on this the happiest people we know are those that are constantly serving other people you know look at my I look at I'll brag on Daniel for a little bit that kid's always helping you need you need to move your you know move from one apartment to the other Daniel's there he's helping people at the gym he's helping people at school he's always doing something for somebody else and he's never complaining usually he's not unless it's his dad he he's never complaining but you look at the young man and he's got a joy to him he's got a happiness that you want to be around but you see other people they're constantly complaining about their lives they're constantly complaining about their themselves and you look and how much do they do for other people I don't mean to be too hard but this is the word you will be happier in serving others back to James chapter 2:1 15 and if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food and one of you say unto them depart in peace be warmed and filled notwithstanding you give them not those things which are needful of the body what does it profit just have faith brother well help you know Brothers you got to get something to eat well buy me lch you know it don't that the words just don't matter even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone James is saying that your faith is dead because there's nothing that follows yay man may say thou Hast faith and I have Works show me thy faith without works and I will show you my faith by my Works what a statement Matthew chapter 15 you don't have to turn there Jesus says this he says you Hypocrites well did Isaiah the prophet say say prophesy of you saying this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honth me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men NIV says this now listen to this this another translation it says they worship me in vain their teachings are merely human rules is what the New International Version says so if the word of God is real then where are your Works where's your kindness where's your generosity where is your sacrifice there was um kind of on the on the the battle theme Here General Patton we all he's a great man in history there was a Roy Roberson as any he did did anybody ever meet Roy Roberson here the two brothers in the back he was a dear friend of of our our family brother Roberson was also was a war hero he got shot up in the war and and he was actually put with the dead people and the Lord came in in a m a miraculous way and really brought him out and and and he remembers it what happened that he was laying with the dead the dead soldiers but brother Roy he he told us a story one time he says he says they were they were going into battle and he says the the artillery was coming down and there were explosions going all over the bullets were whizzing by and they're they're they're taking cover and they're they're taking their positions and they're returning fire and in comes this Jeep and this guy with a pistol on his side comes out and he's a general and it's it's General Patton the bullets flying everywhere and he he was he got into the middle of it and he encouraged the troops and they went out and they went forward and they won the battle and brother Roberton said that guy he said he was fearless and that was their leader that was the leader of this group and let me tell you that's somebody I would follow one that's willing to get in and get dirty one that's willing to make a sacrifice one that's willing to die for the cause and not sit behind a desk there's a parable that Jesus tells let me see if I have it Matthew chapter 13 verse 44 listen to this Parable and and this is is is mostly interpreted in one way and that might be the right way but but this also might be the right way I think parables are meant to make us think je uh Matthew chap 13:44 Yes again the Kingdom of Heaven is like under treasure hid in a field the which when a man hath found he hideth and for Joy thereof goeth and sth all that he have and buyeth that field and again the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly Parts when who when he found one Pearl I'm sorry seeking goodly pearls who when he found one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and brought it and bought it so we have this man that he there's this treasure in the field he goes and he he sells everything he has for this treasure and then he has the treasure and this and it's the same story with this other man that that sees this pearl of great price and he sells everything that he has and he goes and buys this Pearl most of the time I think we interpret those Parables as being when I found Christ I gave everything that I had and I gave it all up for this but look at this in a different way it's not maybe us that saw that pearl of great price and gave everything for it what if that was actually what if I was that pearl of great price what if I was that hidden treasure buried in that field and then somebody else sees this hidden treasure and says that is worth more than anything in the world this Pearl is worth more than all the riches that could be I am going to go and I'm going to give everything and I'm going to purchase that Pearl I'm going to purchase that treasure what if I was that treasure what if you were that treasure what if our children are that treasure and here comes God and he says I'm going to give it all for you I'm going to make that purchase and I'm going to give the greatest thing that I have for that purchase Jesus gave his life for God gave his son for it I mean I'd give everything in the world before I'd give my son and God gave the thing that meant the most to him he gave the thing of most value to him he gave his only begotten son and he bought me and he bought you I was that pearl of great price brother Manny how was it you know you brother Lono you were that treasure that God gave everything for all of us he gave it all he gave it all for me he showed that yeah you can talk a big talk but let me see you put put your money where your mouth is and let me see you do it works is Faith expressed so what did he do Christ showed that this James this James he saw what Jesus did and he says now you do the same you give everything you you become a Christian and when you become a Christian there has to be a life that follows there has to be works that follow James 2:18 continue on yay a man say thou Hast faith and I have Works show me thy faith without works and I will show you fa my faith by my Works look at Jesus's faith I think he showed with his works and all these disciples that follow them they gave their lives for this thou believest that there is one God thou doest well I love this part about James remember he's a pastor he's bold he says you believe we're at the end time you believe that God sent a prophet you believe that that Jesus is the Christ you believe that God created the heavens and the Earth you believe the Bible all that is good congratulations the Devils believe also and tremble thou believest that there is one God th doest well the Devils believe also and tremble but wilt thou know oh vain man that faith without works is dead you talk about all this stuff but there's not a life following James is saying it's dead it doesn't mean anything show me is what James is saying your life proves who you are brother brandom said he said um he said your life is speaking so loud I can't hear what you're saying it's the same here James is James is saying that he's like he's like listen you're you're saying you believe it I'll quote uh Brother Brad Burgess you know brother Brad in in uh the church in Louisville he said this he said saying you believe the message does no more to prove that you have the Holy Ghost than walking under a barn makes you a horse and that's the truth I stand behind it you can say all you want but show me the life what's that song that brother Aaron sings the life behind the name show me the life but wilt thou know a vain man that faith without works is dead was not Abraham Our Father justified by works when had offered Isaac his son upon the altar see us thou how Faith wrought with his works and by works was Faith made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled which saith Abraham believed and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called a friend of God you know the story of Abraham he's talking about so Abraham all of the promises that God had given him were right here in this young man this boy that was his son a miracle birth he was like a hundred years old and he had this son his wife was like 90 years old they had this son and this son was God was going to create all these nations out out of his his child and and and make and bless all of the Nations because of this these tribes that would eventually go to Israel all of this was going to happen and then God says oh yeah this one that you're that everything's going to happen now take him up and sacrifice him to me what but Abraham believed God look at the difference look at the same as Jesus and Abraham Abraham got his son up there and like we're going to do it God said it he's the one that gave me the promise and when God gives us a promise it doesn't have to make sense in how we fulfill and how we go through our lives but he gave us a promise and here's Abraham he brings his son up there and and the boy's like uh dad um I know we're going up to make an offering and we have we have all the all the kindling all the bundles and we're going to make the altar here but there's no sacrifice where's the ram Abraham's like because the faith he said God will provide a sacrifice with the intent of sacrificing that boy brings him up to the altar they built this rock altar he binds his son puts him up there on top of the On Top of the Rock Altar and and all the fire all the the sticks are there to burn the burn the offering burn his son he takes the knife he's gonna do it man and then the Lord says hold on Abraham I know you're going to do it I know you believe me and then Abraham looked over and they're caught in the in the bushes in a place that there were no Rams there was no wild sheep or anything he sees there a ram caught in the bushes and then God says see I'll provide and he takes that RAM and he kills it and James is saying this is the same Faith you see then how that by works a man is Justified and not by faith only how many have us us have fallen in the Trap of saying that just because I believe I'm saved or just because I believe that I'm the bride James is absolutely refuting that when James says that the Devils believe and tremble this scripture seems to be saying that the Devils many times even have more respect but he's saying that no just saying that let me see let me see a life behind it likewise also was not Rahab the Harlot justified by works when she had receed the messengers and had sent them out another way so Rahab Joshua is coming across Moses dies Joshua takes the people God instructs them to go over into the promised land the waters um dry up on both sides of the Jordan River Joshua goes across there's this big city of Jericho with all of these walls and the the rumor or the news had gotten to the people inside this this city of Jericho that hey these people God's with them and it started going around this big city of Jericho and here's this woman and Not only was she just a woman she was a prostitute she was the lowest and she hears all of these rumors that God's with these people and she took a chance wasn't a chance she believed God is what she did and these two spies come in and she knows she finds out that they are from these Israelites and she risked her life to hide them to SA gave them how did she do that by faith she wasn't just sitting there and saying oh yeah when they come in walls are going to fall down and California's going to sink and there's going to be all this stuff and we're going to go on up no no no no she says I'm going to do something and Rahab put her faith in the action and she says come in come in come in let me hide you let me take care of you I believe your God is God but when you come in and when you destroy this city I know it's a big fortress but listen God God's with you and it doesn't matter how big this Fortress is whenever you come in remember me and remember my family likewise also was not Rahab the Harlot justified by works when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way Rahab risked it all she had faith and she had the works to back it up for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also wow what a statement by this man James the musicians can come now the Book of James like any other book of the Bible it wasn't written with chapters in it it was just written as one big long letter and the um I believe by inspiration that these chapters were set forth but let's just read this through for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also my brethren be not many Masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation new King James says my brethren Le let not many of you become teachers knowing that we shall receive a stricter judgment he's saying you want to be a preacher you want to be a teacher you want to be in charge of of a congregation he's like you're going to be judged at a higher Lev level and he just talked about having all this Faith so how can a man preach to a congregation if he's just has an understanding of the word and hasn't been there remember when years ago I'd have Stephanie I'd have her just dropped me off in certain parts of the town and I would go and I would witness to as many people as I could and I'd always tell tell Stephanie I'd say um yeah just drop me off I'm going to see if I can find somebody to listen to me and it never came to anything and I look back on those days and what was I trying to do I was trying to get them to think like me I was trying to get them to understand my way of thinking and thinking that that would bring Salvation rather than showing them a living Jesus Christ with faith [Music] same I remember another man that he drove across the country he came and he wanted me to cast out a demon from him and it came to me and and didn't work it didn't work because my faith wasn't in the right thing but now I look look [Music] at how the Lord has revealed to me that it is a living Jesus Christ it's not some Doctrine it's not some church it's not some denomination but it is Christ him alone living and he is alive and I can show you him and he will do it he can do it through me he can do it through any any of you he can do it through any person that really believes it's different now as far as me I can see that now I can see that why did it not make a difference back then for the same reason is these people coming to me and saying here you need to preach this this this and this aren't you AR aren't you trying to get them to the pure unrated word of God and all this and it's like wait I'm trying to get them to Jesus Christ because I can see and there are people in this congregation that are witness that yes God does heal God does deliver from addiction God does restore our families and if we get them to Jesus Christ that is what it is and not to a denominational way of thinking that's what works and it works it worked 2,000 years ago it worked with Abraham 45 3,500 years ago 4,000 years ago it worked with Moses it worked with Joshua it worked with Rahab it worked with James and it works today look look and I like to tell you yeah you are that pearl of great price you are that treasure that was buried that this man named Jesus Christ found and gave his life I was that I was that Pearl and I owe him he what he did for me he found me he found me buried he found me buried in every all kinds of things that I was buried in and he brought me out thank God you said well brother Daniel what can I do you talk about Works what do you want me to do number one follow his Commandments put into practice what he said to do they asked the same thing in Acts chapter 2 I can quote it or I can read it they asked the same thing they were cut in their hearts and they said what must we do Peter we see that you got it what must I [Music] do now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said to Peter and the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do now you believe now you got to put the faith in the action then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins for the washing away of your sins for the taking away of your sins and thou shalt receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for This Promise is unto you and to your children and to them that are far off even as many as the Lord our God God shall call just believing brothers and sisters there is more to it James he wouldn't have said the Devils believe and he's not saying that you're a devil he's not saying that you're wrong what he's doing is he's saying Brethren put it to work I don't believe he was calling anybody a devil I don't believe he was insult being insulting in any way I think he was saying listen that the Devils know the same stuff now you put it to work and what did Peter say repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall it's it's a promise it's not just I hope I will I can claim it if I go up to those Waters of baptism I can claim that I will if I have not yet will receive the infilling of the Holy Ghost and when you receive that infilling let me tell you something there's a change that takes place in your life and people try to Define it this way and they try to Define it that way when you are filled with the Holy Spirit God takes precedence in every part of your life doesn't mean you won't make mistakes doesn't mean you won't fail but when you get right down to it the Lord is the most important all of us can say that but when you truly received the Holy Spirit now you are on the battlefield for God be a good time to be baptized if you want to be baptized we have at least one do we still have one brother let me tell you something this is putting faith into action you can say it all you want but it takes an effort to stand up and say I want to do it I want to be baptized and Lord not just be baptized but then there's more after baptism don't just leave it up in the water now go out and put this faith into action brother Stephen go to battle now not for the defense of the country but for the Salvation of the country for the Salvation of your neighbors for the Salvation of your community for the Salvation of your family go to battle and that's what this baptism means that's what this book of James is about put your faith into action brother you can go back and and uh meet the brothers back there if there's anyone else that wants to be baptized we can um we can show you up to the to the baptismal brother you can go back and uh and meet the deacons back there and they'll they'll bring you up brothers and sisters I know that this book of James is difficult it makes us stand back and look how am
