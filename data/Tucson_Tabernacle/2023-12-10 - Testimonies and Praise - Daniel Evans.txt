good to be in the house of the Lord today for a praise and worship service to give honor and glory to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ you know there was a time when they asked us who had a testimony and just a young girl there in that Welsh Revival she raised her hand and said I just want to say I love the Lord Jesus and that started such a move because when you give God honor glory and praise he comes in the midst so that's his promise for us today amen so a prayer request we have a couple of requests uh to bring to your attention here uh sister Marlene Henry asked us to remember brother Wilson he had hip surgery so we'll remember for a quick recovery and my older brother Fred had my dad called me and said that he had been with a cold and fever and was asking for prayer and then we had made a request for a little 8-year-old girl named scarlin Scarlet my cousin's granddaughter and um the the Physicians were were uh happy with the way all the surgery went they they felt they were able to do what they wanted to do but it was still in a critical situation as they took a portion of the bone off of the leg and replaced a portion of the bone in the arm but now they were watching the blood flow and everything I asked him how was she Scarlet was doing he said well when she came out of surgery she was in pain and she was cranky and that would be about what you would expect the doctors were able to take care of the pain and then the picture he showed me later she looked happy she's just an eight-year-old young girl with cancer but I know a God and I know if you'll raise your hand I know that same God he's the same yesterday today and forever sopio stand and stand with me here and believe that they're just not words coming out of your mouth who knows where but they're going to God's ears Lord we We Gather this evening Lord and to give you honor and glory to talk about your wonderful Works to to express Even in our own lives a testimony of what you've done for us Lord to sing praises to your name to give you all honor and Glory you deserve Lord father be pleased today and come and and visit and and Minister you've heard the requests for brother Wilson Lord in that hip surgery for my brother who's not feeling well and for little Scarlet Lord who just went through this just serious surgery Lord but father you called one out had been dead behind a in a tomb for three days you said Lazareth come forth and he did Full of Life and you said you would lay your own life down in three days you would pick it up and because you live we live today Lord so we take you at your word and we Just Want To Praise You In song in testimony and worship today Lord that's our heart's desire Lord so we just ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen do you want to take partner yeah okay you introduce how you want be sure God bless you all Let's uh let's remain standing for a minute let's open up our Bibles to Hebrews um I believe it's chapter 15 yes Hebrews chapter 15 I'm sorry chapter 13 verse1 15 it says this by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually that is the fruit of our lips giving Thanksgiving to his name but to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifices God is well pleased amen which is exactly what we're going to do tonight you can take your seats so what we'll do is we will um I'll give the option um for those who want to give a testimony I'll give the option you can come up here to this microphone or I can take a microphone to you in the congregation and uh we will be giving testimonies and praise and and singing and I only have a couple songs written down but uh you're welcome also to come up and sing just raise your hand when I call for it God bless you do we have a brother Aaron do we have a first song for us we have our group here did you all have a a song Ready Jess a song great I think sister Jessica is a great one to Break to break the ice got a very very talented sister while sister Jessica is coming up can I I'll give I'll give the first testimony this one's a this one's a story that uh someone sent to me May uh I don't know 10 years ago or so and uh it's it's a bit of a parody but uh I think it's it's um more true than um than we might we might give it credit for reads like this as I said I I um took this from someone sent it to me and and I uh made a few changes but it says this a few years after I was born my dad met a stranger who is new to our small Texas town from the beginning dad was fascinated with this enchanting newcomer and soon invited him to live with our family The Stranger was quickly accepted and was around from then on as I grew up I never questioned his place in my family in my young mind he had a special Niche my parents were complimentary instructors mom taught me good from Evil and dad taught me to obey but the stranger he was our storyteller he would keep us Spellbound for hours on end with adventures and Mysteries and comedies if I wanted to know anything about politics history or science he always knew the answers about the past he understood the present and even seemed able to predict the future he took my family to the first major league ball game he made me laugh he made me cry The Stranger never never stopped talking but Dad Dad didn't seem to mind sometimes mom would get up quietly while the ref rest of us were shushing each other to listen to what he had to say and she would go to the kitchen for peace and quiet I wonder now if she ever prayed for the stranger to leave dad ruled our household with certain moral convictions but the stranger never felt obligated to honor them profanity for example was not allowed in our home not from us our friends or any visitors our longtime visitor however got away with four-letter words that burned my ears made my dad squirm and my mother blush my dad didn't permit the use of alcohol but on a regular basis The Stranger encouraged us to try it he made cigarettes look cool and cigars manly and pipes distinguished his comments were sometimes blatant sometimes suggestive and generally embarrassing I now know that my early Concepts about relationships were influenced strongly by this stranger time after time he opposed the values of my parents yet he was seldom rebuked and never was he asked to leave more than 50 years have passed since the stranger moved in with our family he has Blended right in and is not nearly as fascinating as he was at first still if you walk into my parents' Den today you will find him sitting over in his Corner waiting for someone to listen to him talk and to watch him draw his pictures his name we call him television he a wife now we call her computer there are children iPad iPhone and Android go everywhere with us God bless you Sister Jessica follow the star to a place unexpected would you believe after all we've projected a child in a Manger lonely and small the weakest of all unlikeliest Hero wrapped in his mother's sh just a child is this who we've waited for cuz how many kings step down from their Thrones how many lords have abandoned their homes how many great have become the least for me and how many gods have poured out their hearts to romance the world that is torn born all apart how many fathers gave up their sons for me bringing our gifts for the newborn savior all that we have whether costly or Meek because we [Music] believe gold for his honor and frankincense for his pleasure and Mer for the cross he'll suffer do you believe is this who we've waited for and how many kings step down from their Thrones how many lords have abandoned their homes how many great have become the least for me and how many gods have poured out their hearts to romance the world that is tor born all apart how many fathers gave up their sons for me only one did that for [Music] me and how many kings step down from their Thrones how many lords have abandon their homes how many greats have become the least for me and how many gods have poured out their hearts to romance the world that is torn all apart how many fathers gave up their sons for me only one did that for me oh only one did that for [Music] [Applause] me how long did it take you to figure out who that stranger was I can I remember when Dad allowed a TV in our home we were just young kids and something we had never had in our lives and it didn't last that long he came home and found the house not clean and my sister and my mom watching the TV and me and my brother watching Saturday mornings and not cleaning the yard and he said you're out of here and I thank God for that now sometimes I wish I could toss the phone when I'm driving down the road but it has its place and if you allow God to govern your life the things in your life that are are necessary are able to you're able to keep so there's a song in we'll sing a verse or two Victory in Jesus I heard an old old story yes amen heard an old old story Our Savior came from Glory how he gave his life on C to save a wret like me I heard about his groaning of his flous blood atoning then I repented of my sins and won the victory oh Victory in Jesus my Savior forever he sought me and he bought me with his redeeming blood he loved me I knew him and all my love is to him he plunged me to Victory beneath the cleansing FL heard about his healing of his cleansing power revealing how he made the lame to walk again cause the blind to see and then I CED dear Jesus come and heal my broken spirit and somehow Jesus came and brought to me the victory oh victory in Jes Jesus my Savior forever he sought me and he bought me with his redeeming blood he loved me I knew him and all my love is new him he plunged me to Victory be the ring FL brother Ron Glide well if you would make your way up I'll give a short testimony as brother Ron's coming up my um grandfather my uncle Ronnie um and a couple other brothers were standing outside my grandpa's um service station down here on Park Avenue many many years ago and brother brand they were talking about this new fighter named Cashes Clay and this Cashes Clay he um was uh if you've ever heard some of the old videos of Muhammad Ali had just a mouth constantly talking and constantly just taunting and all that and brother brandham they were talking they were standing on the corner outside the the service station there brother brandham came driving up not knowing anything about what they were talking about obviously he couldn't have known rolls down his window and he says this he says Cash's Clays GNA get his mouth shut with a broken jaw and a left hook and the next fight was against a boxer named Ken Norton who broke Muhammad Ali's jaw with a left hook amazing it was just amazing that he knew what they were talking about and amazing that he said even such a little thing as that he was still a prophet God bless you brother Ron if you come you're okay coming up here right you feel comfortable well I comp thought about maybe not doing this because I don't seem to be able to tell a short story but everything is connected and how I got to my recent testimony is so many other connected testimonies but uh here recently I had uh well I go in every year to get a u an x-ray of my kidneys because I'm prone to kidney stones I've had them wow I can't remember how many and operated it on two or three times and it's uh quite a trial but anyway my last x-ray my my cat's can uh the radiologist he reads the uh report and then he'll he'll call you and I'm from radl TD and how you doing make sure who a yard and he reads you the report and um so they said you know we uh we'd like to have another uh a special x-ray called the Pet Scan he said we've uh we noticed you have three small kidney stones on on your left side he said they're they're just very small he said they shouldn't be a problem for a long time but we found a a spec on your left lung and we want to look at it deeply we we want to uh inject a radioactive dye into your bloodstream and we want to look at it well I I my mother's had these these she's had part of her lung removed from lung cancer and you know you you look at others when they go through this and you go man why are they so afraid well you know why you say that because you never been through it and I'll tell you what the enemy comes to you and brother Bown talked about Satan talking to him and you know why we know he's talking because it's always negative it's always hurtful amen he always lies and if you have the Holy Spirit and I know I do I knew he was talking but you know I'm still in this carnal flesh okay let's do this so they made a schedule and I went down and had this terrible x-ray I I never thought of myself of being claustrophobic but I'm telling anybody that's been through this I'm very sympathetic to you now and they put me in there and because my arms were hanging over this little table that slides back and forth in the CAT scan I don't know if anybody's ever been in it but it's very intimidating well they put this Vel curl belt about this thick around my arms I couldn't move I had to lay still for 25 minutes and I'm already anxious and I had a panic attack there you go here I go I've been critical of those of panic attack well I got a panic attack so if you have a pan attack I'm sympathetic and I just laid there and my I can't take this anymore but I remembered every time I've had a nightmare or been in trouble Lord Jesus help me with this and I'd have to say something happened to take the fear away something happened to take whatever situation I was in a way I I can't explain it but I know what happened and I open my eyes and something says you have to finish this you can't stop or you'll have to come and do it again oh okay anyway so we waited for the the radiologist they have a specialist that he reads these X-rays and he calls you personally I get the phone call my wifei the living room and I go Susie this is it so I put it on speaker phone and Mr glidewell I'm so and so and I've read your X-ray and he went on about we found the three little nodules of kidney stones he says there nothing to worry about said you should never have to worry about that and he said that uh little nodule in your lung he said it's uh 5.57 CM you know whatever he said it's rather small right now he says I guess you're wanting to hear this he goes uh don't worry it's not cancerous praise God thank God but I had went through the fear and this is the testimony to help you I'm not here really to talk about me I want you to if you go through this I I want to give you an experience that he's real he's there yes amen and that I told my wife I said you know mom's had this very same thing and I said now I'm so sympathetic to what she went through and she suffered so greatly she's cancer free now but she went through her time of troubles and I thought well I've been through a lot of other stuff I'm not going to really go through everything here and lay it out but I said you know Lord whatever it is I'm willing to go through it whatever is going to happen I know it's in your hands but I tell you what when he said there's no cancer my I'm glad I didn't have to go through that and everything I think we can find I know we can in the Bible one of the every situation you go through you can find another situation similar and it'll help you you remember the Apostle Paul he was always getting beaten and whipped and and hurt and lied on everywhere he went and yet he kept going and I remember this one place in the Bible where an angel says don't worry Paul they're not going to hurt you this place is going to be a place you can rest my how satisfying that was for him because it you know he he had been a witness against Christians and we know that his heart was to give us life you know and to prove himself but even that burden for Apostle Paul must have been great the Lord knew he couldn't take it again we're just human we can only take so much but you know he always makes a way for us my whole life has been like this I've learned everything the hard way I don't encourage you to do it my I've been with friends and they roll the car over and they were drunk and people were laying on top of me and the gasoline was the engine was still running and I thought well this is it somehow or another I got out of it I've been in truck accidents where I leave the truck over I I trained a driver and he went off the road and in West B Indiana we came to off the freeway and ended up in somebody's backyard but I'm still here amen thank God the kidney stones and when I was a young man we were we would go to haml park and find out where all the parties were and carry on and a man there they tried to arrest him and he had a semi-automatic 45 and he just started shooting randomly bullets were going everywhere none of them hit me it just goes on and on and on and on like this oh God what do you want me to do I've come so close to death I had sepsis I was in the hospital 5 days my left hand I got sepsis in it and it was rotting had a red line running all the way up my arm the doctor says you came this close to dying I said what do you mean he said you see that rotted hand he says if that septus would have got to your heart that's what your heart would have looked like my I was operated on twice I'm still here and I have to say that each time I recover I recover completely wow I see so many people that don't recover so well oh God when can I help in any way and that's that's my motive today amen because I was the child that I I failed into this class because I was so shy and so embarrassed and so I was ashamed of myself and I I wouldn't get up in front of the class or say a word and I would fail a class before I would do it so we don't know what we're going to be God does we say I'm not this I'm not that it really doesn't matter it's what God thinks and and we're here tonight and I believe that each and every one of us has a story and we're going to go through trials maybe this is to help you we're going through trials if you're a son and daughter of God and you haven't went through trials yet you're going to amen when I came back to the Lord and brought my wife with me and she was baptized and for a long time I heard the pastor talk about trials you know brother green I'm I wonder if I'm a Son of God or not I I I haven't seemed to go through trials oh my here they come had a wonderful job my wife didn't have to work the insurance paid for all three of our kids I had a pickup and I had a car and a four-wheel drive and we were buying a house and I got laid off and lost everything then I was helping my dad Landscape Maintenance got my first kidney stone attack spent three days in the hospital and you know I have I I believe that each one of my trials has been for a reason I was forced to get a new Prof passion I became a truck driver which I loved and I retired from that and I was just a natural I can stay up for days without sleep I can go and I just my I can endure pain like you've never known I I have no idea how I do it I can plan a trip remember I had a 10th grade 10th grade education I could plan a trip from Los Angeles New York and be there at the very minute I don't know how I do it but he's been so so merciful and kind to me and loving and I was persuaded that if I had to go through lung cancer I still love himen it's for a reason and a purpose but I'm sure glad he chose not to put me through that so I had so much more I could say but I just hope that that this helps you or our friend or someone you know going through because we're going to go through trials just one more little thing brother I was traveling in my my truck and I had loaded it the day before and I left Catalina and I went up Highway 79 goes through Florence and up through Florence Junction then up to Miami to the smelter and there's long stretches and I was just thinking about a sermon I'd heard and man I just I don't feel anything anybody you had that don't feel anything I think brother Brenham told brother idisco says brother Edie bisc was talking about how the Lord is with him he said well next time the Lord comes to you tell him I love him he said it's been a long time since I felt it so if you don't feel it that don't mean you're not a son or daughter of God keep keep moving forward that means that's nothing and I was just having these feelings of rejection unappreciated you know how that something says are you thankful for anything do you believe God speaks to us if we're listening and I thought to myself well yeah you sure gave me a good wife and she loves me I have three beautiful daughters after I was laid off at the Minds he gave me a job that I really like doing and I make more money and I I I'm I'm not beholding anybody and and it just kept going I started finding all these things that God had blessed me with amen and after a while I had my first real experience and that cab was so full of the presence of God I was scared to look at the seat maybe an angel was sitting next to me I was afraid yeah and I'm telling you the truth I said Lord if you're going to call me home I'll pull over right now and walk out in the desert something said not yet I said oh God you're so close I know of your love and in his presence I have to say he was is not judgmental he didn't bring up any of my faults he just loved me am I'm telling you the truth and I felt so condemned about those that I had held in contempt and my the life that I've lived and and how he's had to just beat me to get me to obey him and he loves me just unconditional it was just amazing I I can't explain it I thought if he if this voice said I would pull over well that would be it I'm I'm going ahead and and that's how close that presence was I was in his presence and he said no I said Lord I'm going to fail you again I always do I I can't I can't live it he said don't worry I'll come to you again that was it and I'll never forget that I've had other experiences but that one was just my you know if you've and when you tell somebody this I've learned that when I hear an experience of anyone I believe it you know why because I've had an experience if you want to believe what's being told over this pulpit ask the Lord say Lord I need an experience what we believe is not just words it is not just teaching it's an experience amen you must brother bam said you must meet the Piller of fire and I'll tell you what you'll not be the same it changes you I'm not the same person I was 10 years ago I'm not the same person I was five years ago I have a long way to go but I believe that he has provided a way for me and each and every one of you that are one of his the opportunity that you have tonight to know the Lord Jesus Christ and to be with lovely people of like Precious Faith that's precious having the opportunity to praise him he's watching do it with a sincere heart whatever he tells you to do do it amen you know we're we're he's a leader but he's a leader of individual Brides of Christ we each and everyone have to have that individual connection with him you must know you must know what God wants you to do amen ask him he'll tell you wait for his answer well brother Ron I've been waiting a long time what are they what did Jesus tell Peter about going to the other room wait until that's what he said I think that that wait until in his due time he'll reveal himself to you he will I trust him I'd have to say that he's come to me so many times he is a friend so many have misunderstood what I was as a child and I was an odd child but I believe Christ has always been there I believe the Lord Jesus has always loved me and for each and every one of you you need this once you know that he loves you you and that you have a purpose it'll change your direction in your life it'll change your opinion of others and once we realize how insufficient we are and yet he would come to us and love us so much that we have an eternal place waiting for us amen that you will allow that for others also amen amen you know I just if you want to help somebody body don't remind them their faults so you know you're you're doing okay can I show you how to do this and uh you might have a little it might work out a little better for you you know just when you instruct somebody you're not doing that right what's wrong with you that doesn't do any good but I I brother green was I'd have to say that man knowing who I was came to the boy's prison where I was at for a year I've seen him be so rough and callous to people and I was embarrassed to be honest with you he could be that way you know he was never that way with me I asked him one day brother green why are you so nice to me he didn't say anything but I think he saw something in me I didn't see so don't give up on yourselves he loves you thank you the Lord has an appointed time for each of us we don't want to go before that time that he might have mercy on us and take us prematurely if we fall into sin but with brother Ron and the Lord taking care of him he has us on Earth Earth not just to be here for no reason he has each of us on Earth for a specific purpose that God has ordained before the foundation of the world and how many here want to fulfill that purpose in their lives amen I bless you uh Brother Joseph Miller if you would make ready where's Brother Joseph if you'd make ready for your song s and brother Aaron if you could lead a song while we're waiting on Brother Joseph thank you through it [Music] all through it all I've learned to trust in Jesus I've learned to trust in God through it all through through it all I've learned to depend upon this word one more time oh through it all through it all oh I've learned to trust in Jesus I've learned to trust in God through it all through through it all I've learned to depend upon his word it's a little different than brother Ronnie when I had the MRI they had my foot in there and she told me if you the Stiller you are and don't move the quicker we'll get this done so I didn't move and it got done she surprised me when she said you're done and now she goes I got up and I said ma'am you all need to get back into the machine and take out all those people they left in there they were banging away the whole time if you've ever been in an MRI machine all you hear is It's banging noise and I said they left the construction workers in there and they need

do you appreciate brother Joe I'm not kidding sister milia you have a testimony is this okay to bring it to you would you rather be up here okay this is kind of embarrassing for me but it's my a part of my testimony it's been anyway it's been over 20 years ago I found myself in a back said condition and while I was out there I got cancer in my tongue and uh and uh anyway so I went to the doctor and uh they I went to the hospital and they took a piece of my tongue off where the cancer was and they opened up my glands on on my right side and had the cancer been there um they would have had to open up my vocal cords and though I don't say that I'm a great singer or anything but I've always liked to sing and um and but they didn't pling the cancer and my vocal cords anyway and so um it impaired my speech uh where before I used to speak English and Spanish very fluently and now well of course I can't roll my ARs and as a Spanish or Mexican person you got to roll your ARS anyway so um I thank God for that that um he healed me it's been over 15 years ago that um I've been cancer free and and though I like I said my speech is a little bit impaired but still I thank God for that and another thing that I couldn't say was the 's um after I had the surgery on my tongue but one night I had was having um I was still out in the world and I was having a nightmare and and in that nightmare I'll always remember that there was a dog chasing me and I couldn't get away from that dog and I I found myself saying Jesus Jesus and I woke up and and that was a turning point in my life I just want to share that appreciate sister Amelia not only is is she a faithful member of the church here but she has brought many many people to this church and she's always witnessing and sister Amelia the lord gave you a voice that you can praise God the lord gave you a voice that you can witness to others for what God has done for you God bless you Sister Amelia wonderful brother Angel can you give me one all right do you want to you want to come up with in front of the all right in fact um this these ones happened here uh when I first came to the Lord we had um a stay in the upper room and uh all the gentlemen gathered for three days um I had been in a really bad accident and my back was really really bad I couldn't really move and stuff and I remember the brothers had um notic I wasn't really myself for two days and uh they laid their hands on me during a sermon and it was talking brother Brown was talking about just to believe she'd be healed and as brother Caleb was walking by he was going to lay his hand on other brother but for some reason he turned around and put his hands on me and at that moment um the pain in my back was gone completely I could move and everything and um they noticed I had a shock on my face and he asked me what was wrong and I said I said I didn't want to say nothing cuz I I didn't want to sound like I was complaining or crying about it but I had a really bad back I explained it I said but when you put your hands on me it was instantly gone so that was one that happened here the other one was when there was a they had a Easter Revival here and me and my family came up to ask for everybody come up and lay hands on and I had some thoughts in my mind and stuff and I remember I was in line and there was a a sister behind me holding her her little girl and um exactly right at this spot that's why I sat here but um this gush of wind just came through and it circled me and it just stayed there for a moment and it left and I was just like wow CU I've had that happen before and um I said Lord I thank you for that and um they laid their hands on me and I had a lot going on they pray for me and I went to go sit down and I remember I told my wife I said you're not going to believe what just happened to me right now and I told her and the brother on the stage started singing um I am the master of the wind so that was amazing that was an amazing night I tell that too and then this even continues further we my wife go home and we're excited okay we came for the Revival it was all three days and we were excited we were just amazed we're laying down and we're in a room and we live out um by the Desert Museum and um we started he singing in the room and me and my wife we look at other like do you hear that she's like yeah I hear that

still hearing it so I tell her what are you hearing and she says I'm hearing like this High just beautiful voice singing like Hallelujah and I was hearing the same thing as well so I said it has to be outside because you know that sound Echoes so I go outside in the desert and nothing we come back in and we're laying there so now we're just listening to this music being played in the room as we're laying there and it lasted like 30 minutes to an hour of just constant singing of Hallelujah and praising and we were just in awe of all that if the numer girls could make ready it's a scriptural

Crooked Road straight he can he can change anything friends have a testimony I'd like to read and uh I'll bring the microphone out if there's something on your heart this is a testimony from a sister that um I used to deal with I was in Jeffersonville and uh she's uh absolutely a precious person um I'll just read her testimony I was born one of eight siblings in a poverty stricken family my father was a hard worker with a bad temper he worked but squandered his money and oftentimes neglected to provide even the Bare Essentials we were not sent to school but kept at home not educated there either I believe I remember right as I think this sister's from Missouri we lived a very secluded we lived very secluded my dad beat my mom and us kids as far back as I can remember my mother understandably stayed depressed and withdrawn at one point my whole head was matted in helmet of in a helmet of Tangles just completely stuck to my head my siblings and I dug in dumpsters and were called mean names by The Neighborhood kids I was often sad about my mom and angry at my dad by the time I was pre-teen I was headed down a road sure to end in my destruction one night while my family while a family m house I overdosed and attempted to just fall asleep forever I took a bottle of pills and drank a bottle of prescription cough syrup that made you sleepy a sibling found me on the floor and I was taken to the hospital and my stomach pumped I spent time in two Mental Hospitals and ran away from home I was eventually removed from the home and placed in a group of Home in a group home for kids I lost every person I'd ever known this made me feel like I was even more worthless at this time she was about the age of of you young young sisters I was beyond angry I had no desire to live because I had already learned life was way too difficult what really complicated matters was that my father was a very religious man he could quote the Bible front and back this made me angry with God I was very angry and decided God must hate me to allow these things to happen to me and my mom and my siblings I thought that all men who claim to be Christians dominated and beat their wives then I decided that there was no God at all I carried a lot of pain and soon discovered the only escape from it was sin in my early 20s I married a man who shared shared many qualities of my father it happens often I was married a short time and then divorced him I lived in Sin from that point on well she didn't say here in her testimony that I know from her is she began living a homosexual lifestyle also I continued self-medicating through my 20s and into my 30s no matter what I tried nothing made any of it make sense to me I started truly giving up on myself I still carried around I still carried around the way I felt all of those years as a child and then as a teen feeling like I was unloved now it was all just covered with years of drug abuse and poor choices I felt like the only one I could count on was myself and I was worthless I felt hopeless and like there was no point in living I lived in a tent and went through deep a deep depression I do not possess words to describe how close to death I lived it was then that God started dealing with me i' would like to say that I submitted right away but I ran one day I was deeply troubled and I was crying I cried out loud why can't I just be happy then just as sure as I am typing this right now I felt something inside of me say you will never be happy living this way because I did not make you to live this way it was not an audible voice but it was a voice I cannot explain it but it is still just as real to me right now as it was then I knew that was God for the very first time in my life I saw just how filthy my sins were I realized how desperately I needed God and I knew he was not at all the god I grew up thinking existed and then denied I still did not understand him but I knew I needed him I needed him more than I had ever needed anything or anyone I did not know what to do I was Restless I started trying to bargain with God it was very hard to let go of that control he continued dealing with me years ago my dad had told me that God did not hear my prayers I'll tell you why he said his dad said her dad said that well well soon you know it's because she had short hair years ago my dad had told me that God did not hear my prayers so I stopped praying in my teens because I had believed him I told God that I would refrain from my sins but I would not be a hypocrite and go to church God had different plans for me a young sister was attending a funeral for someone who had gone to her church so I drove her there I'm sorry a younger sister this girl girl's younger sister so I drove her there I stood in the back of the funeral par parlor parlor and folded my arms I looked at it looked at everyone with their long dresses and their long hair and I decided that they were all judging me the devil was really fighting for my soul I had stood there and nearly convinced myself that this was a bad decision being there in that place when this man standing beside me moved to the side to let someone pass and he said excuse me sister to me it was as it was as if he did not see my hair was at best best an inch long or that I I wore pants and makeup his kindness to me made me have to admit he had something I wanted he had God's love in his heart it's softened my spirit enough that I listened to what the preacher was saying and he was saying some hard things but I felt like the things he was saying were true I went to church with my sister for a few weeks I said okay I will go but I don't believe God cares what I wear so I'm going to wear pants and I did at the time I didn't even own a skirt one day the preacher spoke on the chastisement of our peace it was as if he was talking directly to me when he gave an altar call I could not get to the altar fast enough it was as if something carried me there I cried and I cried but this was not like any other time I had cried I was pouring it all out to God when I stood up from the altar I was a different woman I could not wait to get home and get the pants out of my house I went home and got rid of everything I thought was displeasing to the Lord I threw away a lot of things and I was happy about it I went back to work that Monday and my boss asked me if I was on drugs she was on the thing that these drugs are trying to impersonate for the first time in a long time I was not on drugs he told me I lost my Edge and I looked washed up without the makeup on and my hair not spiked he asked me who told me it was wrong to spike my hair and I told them nobody told me that it was wrong I just felt it was wrong belong to me he laughed at me I was happy though I didn't even care what he thought I left his office and prayed for him I would sit in my vehicle on my lunch break and wait for people to come out of the store then I would put away their buggy just to have an excuse to say God bless you to them I wanted to tell absolutely everyone what the Lord had done for me it made my heart turn hurt that people did not know God three years later I fought a lot of battles I have won some and I've lost some I learned from each one to depend on God I used to be angry about my upbringing but I look back now now and I see the hand of God in my life all along so many things I did not understand were the very things that brought me to where I needed to be I have learned the exact opposite of what I was so certain was true before I met him I am not the only one I can count on when I try to go it alone I mess it up but when I lean on him I feel peace I have never felt before the world has absolutely nothing for me there is nothing but heartache and pain out there but in him only I find peace that no drug could ever produce every day I'm amazed at his love for me even though I Am So Unworthy when I look around and see how strong so many of the spirits I was bound by our I know it was nothing short of his amazing grace that Set Me Free I thank the Lord for saving my soul and revealing to me the Elijah of this age as the song beautifully states he knew me yet he loved me amen friends do you see why I said this morning what a blessing all of you all have been and just welcoming people in it was a man Heath he just called her sister just one word called her a sister and there that predestinated seed of God came into that image of Jesus Christ and it started right there and now she is serving the lord Jesus she is happy all of the drugs are gone all of the sins are gone and she is doing her best and she is just rejoicing in the love of the Lord amen do you like that testimony I do [Applause] too I'm GNA grab the microphone did I miss anyone for singing oh brother ly yes brother Lyle and and sister Heather right you're both gonna sing come come forward please brother Aaron if you could lead us in a song Thank I'm a that you love I'm a man how you came through your precious blood I found pardon and my sins are washed there all washed away all my sins are washed away I'm a man that you love me I'm amazed how you care Through Your Precious Blood I found B and my sins are washed they're all washed away all my sins are washed away I keep on walking okay I want to give a little testimony and that is that I was young and now I'm old but I've never experienced the Lord forsaking me ever amen that I want everybody to know that any drop of good is something that the Lord has done and that he is faithful and you don't want to go anywhere else but with Jesus he is precious he's wonderful he's sweet he's kind he's thoughtful I mean he's wonderful and sometimes I think there just isn't enough adjectives in English so I try in Spanish Maro es spectacular whatever and then let try a little bit of Hebrew you know but the thing is he is so precious that he I'm just telling you don't go any other way he is marvelous this morning after service I was in the parking lot there talking a bit with brother Roman so glad that he's not in a wheelchair and on crutches and that's when I I don't know if that's when I thought about this song but I it's connected I search and I search for the road that leads to Glory I wondered if I'd ever find the way I sat down to rest for the feet had grown so weary and then I Heard a Voice Within Me say you've got to keep on walking just keep right on walking walking in the light of the Lord you'll get to Heaven someday if you walk the right way walking in the light of the Lord I prayed and I prayed for the Lord to give me mercy I pray for him to brighten up my way I was so afraid for the road became so lonely and then I Heard a Voice Within Me say you've got to keep on walking just keep right on walking walking in the light of the Lord you'll get to Heaven someday if you walk the right way walking in the light of the Lord Brother randam was in Memphis Tennessee and he says he says uh I I got out and started down the street trying to find the post office I was walking down the street singing that little Pentecostal song telling now both far and wide his power is yet the same I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them and and going singing that little song after a while I felt something going got close I stepped back up behind a great big column there I said Heavenly Father what would you have your servant do it kept going I was real still a minute and I heard a deep voice say go turn back well I turned and I went walking back down the street I walked and I walked on past the hotel and down through South Memphis just walking on and on the sun was way high then the sun was up it was a beautiful spring morning the fragrance of the flowers in the air had perfumed the air I thought how beautiful was going along that I thought Lord I don't know you said walk here I am I'm walking I just kept on walking walking walking you've got to keep on walking just keep right on walking walking in the light of the Lord you'll get to Heaven someday if you walk the right way walking in the light of the Lord I'm gonna have we got to close with that song all right who has a testimony sister hi good evening um so was debating if I should um share this I try not to make it too long but so uh 2020 um was a hard year for everybody uh lot of people um went with the Lord a lot of losses um uh lost my sister in 2020 was one of the big losses we had in our family she was my best friend so that really hurt um I thank the Lord that well she she battled addiction and uh um for many years I um and I was sharing this testimony with sister Jessica uh last week um so for many years she struggled with addiction and I uh I always seem to find the strength to uh to chase her down and try to help her um my husband and I at the time um we had just gotten married and he was working uh long hours and when he would come home I I would get calls from my sister and she was always like out in the streets or something was going on with her and and I would wake him up and I would tell him she needs our help and we would get up 3:00 4 in the morning sometimes and uh go pick her up after a while I questioned myself why I kept doing this and um it wasn't until she passed away I realized that it was the Lord so um as years went on WE ministered to her we even brought her to church one time when we used to go over to brother Baker's um or was it here um sorry it was here we brought her here and she um she accepted the message right away um she had not yet fully surrendered to God but I knew was coming I just couldn't give up on her so um in 2019 we had a really bad car accident uh we almost we almost died uh we had a really bad rollover she showed up at the scene after it happened all of us were going to go we were going into different ambulances to the hospital Hospital which we were called like the miraco family because we I didn't even have my seat belt on so I remember her saying to me at later that day I can't lose you guys I prayed that night and this is what she told me she told the Lord that to spare us and to take her instead because we have had so many children and so much to live for here so as time went on uh my sister my my other sister had taken her on a retreat uh to study about Ruth and uh she called me from there she couldn't wait to share the news with me and she called me and she said um I gave my life to the Lord and I was just I just started crying and um that's when she officially became sober and she stayed sober uh 2020 came she got sick so everybody was really scared of covid so we kind of isolated and well we were all quarantined but she had her own little place there and we couldn't really see her because she was sick but she didn't really get sick she just kind of lost her smell and her taste so the last time I seen her um I took her some food and left it at the gate and I remember the last thing she' told me was I wish I could just hug you and we kind of just touched fingers through the gate we had attachment issues we had to always be together that week she was supposed to go to her house and she wasn't answering and uh we knew something was wrong so I constantly called her she didn't answer so then we all decided to go to her house which um we found her in her apartment she had passed away um at first we didn't know what happened I I I couldn't understand I thought she went back to to um heroin but um my daughter Serenity found her phone and then we investigated what happened a friend gave her a a pill for her back pain which was clarified on the text message that she was hurting and she wanted something to uh help her back so so end up being fental um the reason I'm sharing this is because I think that I've been since that year I've been very angry and even though I've had a thousand conversations with the Lord I've been feeling out of place but I remember one thing that the Lord told me that that helped me a lot I was sitting in my uh in my room one day crying for her and I was angry at him and I told him why' you take her from me I spent years chasing her down for you and you told me to do this you told me don't give up on her just keep going just keep showing her love and I did and as uh years went on I was exhausted but I did it for you and all you gave me was 15 months of her sober to get to know who she really really was outside of the drugs and I told her why did you why did you just give me 15 months after I did this for you for so many years and I remember just crying and I was kneel down by my window and I heard the Lord speak to me and he said uh you're right I did ask you to do all this I had you chase her I had you take her to rehab all these things when and I gave you the strength to do that but you tell me you're wrong about one thing I didn't give you 15 months with her amen because you did all this I gave her to you for eternity yes amen [Applause] and so as um we had a lot of losses after that my father-in-law passed away the next year after that and then my my sister's husband when my brother-in-law passed away after that and then in January of 2022 I thought I was next cuz I was in the hospital for a month I had got diagnosed with diverticulitis and my husband was like New Year someone else we would seem to have been losing somebody every year um my surgeon was um a very good surgeon but she was not compassionate at all basically told me my infection was too bad I probably wasn't going to survive so she uh you know we went through the process of just what was probably going to happen I was if I did wake up which was very slim I was going to end up in ICU um at that time they weren't really allowing people in the hospital still so I they gave the exception of all my kids coming and say by to me which I didn't accept um but I just wanted to see them before Sur surgery so um we talked and everything and I had a church is praying for me um I remember people reaching out to me telling me that they were praying for me and and so uh I went into surgery uh she said well you know you Pro it's probably going to take a while couple hours to wake up you know I it's really bad and she just basically I felt like that she had no hope hope for me and I told her why I have people praying for me so uh we had surgery 5 minutes after surgery I woke up and I can actually feel things being taken out of my throat I think uh the Lord allowed that to prove to me that he's more powerful than what surgeon was telling me and all her experience um so then at that same week there was kind of a little complication where they were draining the app the infection in my stomach and I had come out and uh I had to go back into surgery I told my husband the enem is after me I need you to go to the Tabernacle and get me some prayer cloths so he did I don't know who he spoke with but he came back gave me a prayer ha cloth and I said I'm taking this in surgery with me they didn't let me pin it on my clothes because it was the safety pin was metal so I had my hair in a bun and I stuck it in my my hair I said this is going with me it was one of the most terrifying things I ever experienced but the Lord reminded me that it wasn't it wasn't one of the most painful things I've ever experienced because no matter how painful how much pain I was in I knew what pain was losing someone I loved so I woke up again I'm here and I just remember God telling me right before that second time of surgery he said do you want to be with your sister do you want to see her and I was so not confused I was just like what do I want to do and I felt so selfish thinking that because I have a whole family here and the Lord knew how much I loved my sister I said Lord I'm not ready to go I'm not ready at all I'm not scared but I'm not ready to leave my family please don't take me and the Lord told me good because I wasn't going to you just needed to know that a lot of other things happened I felt like my brother Ron was saying um just trials after trials even my daughter left home she my oldest which we're still praying for to come back a lot of things that our family went through really uh hurt her a lot and I think she couldn't handle it so my point of all this is this whole time I just still I've been felt so like I guess a little lost just with all the losses and the trials so that's when I I reached out to you brother Daniel and I called you and I couldn't remember who you were but you had visited my church when I used to go over brother Bennett and then I remembered after I seen you but when you invited us over and you fed our family you showed us such love I knew this was where we had to be and that's when I felt God's love again and then I remember the first day we got here my husband and I went into the little back room here with the big Bibles and we just cried and I told him what do you feel and he said I feel like I'm home and so that's my [Applause] testimony um I just wanted to I guess remind everybody in here just to I don't know if you you know all of my history I just came back oh my name is record and I just came back to the Lord not too long ago and um to uh to put it bluntly it's not been the easiest thing it's been kind of hard but at the same time it's been glorious too because um you know I can uh I can really say I feel like I'm trying this time before I I not not on purpose or anything but I think I left a lot of things out um and even now I blow it all the time I screw up I do that but God's been merciful to me and uh he's showed me a lot of things and and he's been there for me like in a way I didn't know he was before and um uh years ago I I used to have a a tape player that I I would put in my my word vehicle I'd play brother brandom's tapes on it and um uh I was driving one day and I was kind of keeping my eye up front and then I kind of look down at my map and then up front again and then down at my map and then oh wow here comes a car you know sort of a thing and boom I hit it I said oh no what am I going to do they're going to fire me now and everything else and so and when I hit this guy I hit him his car went into a telephone pole and then that wire you know that's on telephone poles came off and smacked the guy in the arm pow I said oh man this guy's gonna he's going to sue me but uh anyways um he uh he got out of the car I said you all right he said yeah man the thing just hit me in my arm I said uh well I'm really sorry uh he said well just pull over here and we pulled over and um he said I'll tell you what uh we don't have to go to to the go through the insurance if you don't want to you can just give me a couple hundred bucks for the bumper and and I'll fix it myself I said whoa uh okay yeah that sounds fine and um I shook the guy's hand he's he was actually a Christian man I shook the guy's hand I hopped back in my truck and it was really funny I was just driving down the street you know thanking my lucky stars and the tape player was right here just uh as as we were driving it was like it was like it was pushing me like hey push play and so I did and brother brandham said you know sometimes the Lord will get you into something just to show you he can get you out of it that's good amen so that's that's my testimony sometimes God will get you into something just so he can get you out of it amen God bless you guys this this guy this guy and me were old friends and when I moved from Jeffersonville my family can testify of this when I moved from Jeffersonville there was one person that was really really strong in my heart I called um my brother-in-law David Carroll and I said hey you got Heath's number he gave me a number it didn't work and um so then we go to brother Po's Church brother po invites me to preach one I believe is a Sunday night and this guy shows up how long it it been since you've been to church yeah long time and he just happens to show up now we're together again real quick we have a couple more minutes if somebody else want to show s um share a short testimony I get to brother Rome it seemed like a lot of the service about MRIs and I want to tell you a couple stories about some MRIs that I've had I had one in the Oral Valley hospital and when I come out uh I asked the girl if she knew Jesus she said no I said well you you or him one just healed me I'm all better and uh so I went back to my room and got dressed and uh the doctor came in want to give me some more tests and I said no I'm dressing I'm going home so she signed me out and released me I never to find out what my problem was but I was healed uh 2 weeks ago our 63rd anniversary we was November 27th and I woke up and I told her we was going to go shopping but I didn't feel good so we went to the VA first where we were there eight hours I had two MRIs an IV blood pressure checked every hour uh what else have x-ray uh CT scans whatever they could give me they gave me and uh they I came out with some vertigo pills well I got a call day or two ago they said to come in Monday morning they found something on my aorta in my neck so I got to go in for a consultation tomorrow they said I might have to have another MRI so I'd like for you all to pray for me that they won't find anything that if I have to have another MRI that that's my testimony and request thank you amen I think there was there was one over here sister s Sister Sarah you're busted because you didn't sing I didn't know you were coming God bless you um as many of you know we put it in a prayer request the other day hopefully you can make this quick but there's a testim Tony I have never shared and I hope this is encouragement and I think I can Echo some of the sentiments that are said here tonight we say testimonies because these are the things that remind us God is present it's also something where we can look at each other's lives we think we're the only ones going through something sometimes and it feels like the you know the sky is closing in it's Darkness you don't see your way through you feel very very isolated very alone but you're not and when you hear testimonies like this this is when it makes you know hey I've been there before I also have eye stories and I was thinking I hear what brother uh brother glod was saying I definitely had an incident where I was trying not to panic as I have claustrophobia you know so I the MRI machine is an inch from my nose and I'm strapped down in that chair I had Belle's paly I could not move my face was frozen too and um I remember praying and asking the Lord to help me and he I felt his arms come around me and I it got me through it was just 15 minutes and I kept telling myself come on it's 15 minutes you can do this but it was it's terrifying you know and we are just hum so there's that but the testimony I wanted to give is when I was first diagnosed way back the 2013 I went back to the hospital being really really sick when I was going to start dialysis i' had been told I was going to die I'd been off of dialysis three months and one of the things that happen and I hope this is not too graphic or offensive to anyone but one of the things that happens when you lose kidney function is you use lose the ability over time to create urine you actually don't even make it your kidneys can't make it so all of that toxic waste in your body stays in your cells in your body and at really high levels that can kill you which was where I was it's blood Ura nitrogen it begins to leak out of your pores and you actually sweat it out as the body's like defense last emergency measure to get rid of this toxicity out of your system before you would actually die from it and I was experiencing something like this what I didn't know though is that it also has a particular smell as you can imagine and when I went in the hospital one of the first things I was told um by the dialysis nurse doing my emergent care she said you know what's really strange she said your levels were some of the highest levels ever recorded some of the nurses said they didn't know the level actually went as high on the chart as what I had it was over 200 um and you're supposed to have a count of a healthy person of only 25 and this would be like you know deciliters per whatever per your bloodstream and um she said their thing was you didn't smell she said I've I've had patients that you can smell the death on them you can smell that toxicity the minute you walk in the door because it's so strong she goes you didn't smell and she had this really curious look on her face well for me that was first kind of astounding I never knew such a thing would be or happen and what my mind went to is we know of a story in the Bible of three Hebrew children in the fire when God told them when they went in they said we will not bow we will not Bend we will not y gued our God is able to deliver us but even if he doesn't we're still not going to Bow and this has been my testimony in my stand I don't give into sickness I don't give into death and even if the Lord takes me home he is still my healer he is still my strength and he is still my keeper he's still the faithful God and one of the promises he gave me he said when you walk through the fire you shall not be burned neither shall the flame Kindle upon you and in that story we know the three Hebrew children went in there and when they came out their hair was not singed and they didn't even smell like smoke and for me this has been something I've held on in my heart and right now today things are you know very difficult I'm very exhausted I'm I'm struggling but I look at these things and I remember them because this is the thing that I can look back and say Lord if you were faithful then you'll be faithful today till the day you take me home whether if it's I go in the Rapture when you come for us or you choose to take me home you are my sovereign Lord and I still give my life and my heart to you thank you for keeping me thank you for strengthening me so I hope that encourages you that even in the middle of the fire he's still in the fire and that and that faith is why our sister is a walking miracle today is that Faith right there amen good evening tonight I don't think uh yes ma'am I was debating whether I should um say this or not but after Sarah spoke I I felt like I should sometimes I drop her off at for treatment when she hasn't slept all night or some whatever reason one day I watched her walk in I said Lord it sure hurts me to see my daughter walking there immediately the thought came to me the Lord spoke to me and said it hurt me too when I saw my son go to Calvary no so what comes or goes it's for God's glory and we give him praise only only a parent could say that Amen brother Aaron if you could lead

sometimes when she comes or we go pick her up comes over to the house but you take God's word and you began to you began to speak it you began to say it and I remind her and sometimes she reminds me and mom and her sister what God has done yes amen we were in a restaurant one day and um she had had one of the doctors tell her as she was leaving the hospital you will be so sick you'll either die or they'll be dragging you in to the hospital if you don't do what we tell you so we were sitting at this restaurant and uh she Taps me on the side and she goes there's the doctor that told me that and he keeps looking at me like he can't believe it amen yes go our God is great yes while amen she is a Sarah Gara is a walking miracle if you want to see a miracle just don't go talk to Sister Sarah
