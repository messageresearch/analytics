half lipped uh his left hip I'll get it right on Tuesday praying God will guide the all things and uh and speedy recovery so you know God has done amazing things through the hands of doctors through the hands of of people like us but he's also done things without a human hand touching but he's gone in there and just done it himself he can Speak Life where there's death he can restore broken limbs broken bones complete healing without a doctor touching so what God desires to do we'll believe that together so also today we heard and uh sister Kelly Batman who we know had been sick quite some time and sister Kelly and the Batman family attended the Tabernacle for many years but sister Kelly has passed away and gone over to the other side so she's well she's happy she's a young lady again she's in a place that we're all Desiring to be so there's that part for the family that's left Scott and sister Wanda and Mom and I know Ben had had gone over already and and stuff but we remember the Batman family at this time but for sister Kelly she's where we desire to be today so in that part we Rejoice but for the family we ask for God's mercy so brother Daryl Ward also mentioned to me that

friends there's just too much pointing to it for it not to be there a deep that calls into the deep that something in our heart tells us that there's a better land for us so glad this morning to be a part of the economy of God aren't you to know that our God's not dead but he's alive forever more amen we don't serve a God that we fashion with our hands but we serve a God who made us with his hands this morning morning he's the same yesterday today and forever aren't you glad to be a part of that well kind it's such an honor to be with you here and certainly enjoyed the opportunity to come to tucsom Tabernacle heard so much about it from the time I was a little boy and to be able to stand here with where great man has stood and brought the word of God it's it's such an honor this morning and I was thinking in the study of I'm not going to sing if y'all want to have a seat but I can't sing but I I was thinking in in the study a few years ago I I shared it with a brother last night but we were down in Louisiana and every year about the second week of February we go down to Manny Louisiana and Minister for brother Jeremy cner down there we've done it for several several years and so he told me said I'm still planning on you being here and so I went ahead and got my tickets you can be seated just for a moment if you want and just kind of comeing n just we did but he said uh just plan on being here so I went ahead and got my ticket I fly quite a bit with Delta so I went ahead and got my ticket a month in advance and went ahead and got the seat that I wanted to sit on and and so we went down to Louisiana had the meeting they brought me up to Alexandria and I was flying back home and so I get on the plane and I stand on there's a man that comes and sits down beside me and he said are you from around here I said no sir I from up in Tennessee and he saidwell what brings you down here I said I'm a preacher he said oh you're a preacher I said said yes sir he said well I go to this Pentecostal Church said we got 1,500 members in our church and I said well praise the Lord I'm just so happy the Lord's blessing you he said well since you're a preacher let me ask you a question and I said well sir I I'm not too smart but if I can help you I'll be more than glad to do it he said my daughter uh was getting her kids ready to uh bring me to the airport and while uh she was getting ready he said I was streaming on the internet that and said I came across something so unusual said I'm going to ask you about it since you're a preacher I said well sir if I can help you I'd be more than glad to do it he said have you ever heard of a man by the name of William brandom I said yes sir his grandkids go to my church and man this guy went ballistic so all the way up to Atlanta Georgia we talked about the Lord and just sharing with what the Lord had done but you know what I got of that was this that one month before that man ever knew that he had a question God done had the answer sitting beside him and that same God is in this building this morning that whatever you have need of or whatever you're facing your life he already knows all about it this morning and we can cast all of our Cares up on him because he cares for us amen if you have your Bible stand with me this morning we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus and kind it's such an honor to be here here it's good to see brother Ben back there my buddy from up there in North Carolina makes me feel at home amen just count of an honor to be here may the Lord richly bless you be our prayer and whatever you have need of this morning I want you to look to him and believe amen because he's the same yesterday today and forever if you have your Bibles turn with to the book of Second Kings we want to read from 2 Kings chapter 4: 25 and I tell you amens and Hallelujah don't hurt my feelings so if you want to join in with the service you're more than welcome to if you want to sit there that'll be all right too but I believe we serve a living God this morning that that you're just as much a part of the service as I am amen and he can move right among the pews as much as he can move from the platform so we just look to him this morning Second Kings want to read from 2 Kings chapter 4 starting at verse 25 do you love him praise the Lord so she went and came into the man of God to Mount Carmel and it came to pass that when the man of God saw her a far off that he said to Gaza his servant behold Yonder is the shemite run now I pray thee to meet her and say unto her is it well with thee is it well with thy husband is it well with thy child and she answered it is well and when she came to the man of God to the hill she caught him by the feet but Caza came near to thrust her away and the man of God said let her alone for her soul is vexed within her and the Lord ha hid it from me and hath not told me then she said did I desire a son of my Lord did I not say Do not deceive me then he said to Gaza G up thy loins and take my staff in thy hand and go thy way and if thou meet any man salute him not and if any salute thee answer him not again and lay my staff upon the face of the child and the mother of the child said as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee and he arose and followed her and he arose and followed her you know why because she would not leave him amen she would not let go let's bow our heads I want to speak to you for a few minutes this morning on hold on hold on almighty God thou who has raised Christ from the grave and sent the promise of the Holy Spirit into our hearts how we bow in your great presence this morning Lord knowing that thou art God and beside you there is none other and Lord we believe your word to be true Nations will fail us and political leaders will fail us and local governments will fail us but your word shall never fail us Lord so father we look to you this morning the author and finisher of our faith and we pray Lord that the same anointing that wrote the word would now move Upon Our Hearts to give us the divine revelation and Lord if there would be some Among Us who are sick this morning or maybe they are weary or down in their Spirit may you come Lord and lift them higher in your word we pray heal our sick Lord forgive us of our sins do something something wonderful among us because you are an awesome God and Lord we ask your blessings upon this Tabernacle and upon the officers and the Ministers of this church may you use them dear God in a great way Lord that Tucson once more will know that you're the same yesterday today and forever Lord those who have traveled to be here today may you bless their efforts Lord when everything said and may it be for your glory and may we say did not our hearts burn within us as he walked and talked with us along the way we commit this service into your hands now For Your Glory for we ask these things in Jesus name and the bride says God bless you Saints you may be seated I want to speak to you for a few minutes on hold on now hold on by definition it means to endure or keep going in difficult circumstances to hold on it means to keep on to last to continue to persevere to struggle on to carry on to go on to hang on to hold out to not give up to see it through to stay the course to sold your own for you veterans this morning to stick at it to stick it out to hang in there all these are simul definitions of the meaning of hold on but the opposite of hold on this morning is to give up and I'm going to tell you that every person in this building will do one or the other you'll either hold on endure persevere keep going struggling on moving on pressing on or you'll give up we're living in a Time friends that we've never seen such a time I'm 61 year old and I've never seen such a time that our nation or is in at this time fear among the people put up their hands and quitting suicides at an alltime high depression at an alltime high Insanity at an alltime high divorce at an alltime high alcoholism is an alltime high drug addiction is an all-time high we're living in a Time when they want to shut our churches down but keep the liquor Ste liquor stores open and people are giving up people are walking away people are laying down and quitting but I say to you this morning Tu s Tabernacle don't give up just hold on Amen you know this shud my woman that we read about in the Bible this morning she to me is the very definition of hold on she stayed the course she did not give up until she got her son back now to get an understanding of what's going on in this scripture we must go back to where the story starts this woman that we read about in the Bible it doesn't give her name but it does give her character that even thousands of years later after this event we still talk about the faith of the shemite woman and I say this morning if the world Never Knows My Name God give me Grace that they know my faith Hallelujah that I stood the course that I stayed the course that I did not give up amen it doesn't give her name but it does tell us where she's from she is a sudoite woman from the city of Shain now schain means a double rest she was from the city of a double rest or two places of rest now Shain is a city in ascar north of manassis about five miles south of Mount Taber is where it's located and the great prophet Elisha would travel through this city on his travels and so it came to pass that she noticed this man of God and she wanted to do something for him she offered him some bread and defended the man of God and one day she told her husband I want to make room in our house for the man of God that he could have a place when he passes through that he can have a place of rest in a city called rest so she made a room in her home for the prophet and no doubt she called it the Elisha room I've stayed in many of them and I think that would be a good thing for us to do here this morning is that we would clean some of the junk out of our lives that we would get rid of some of the Clutter that's in our lives the things we brought into our lives that keeps us upset that keeps us distracted and make room for Jesus Oh My wouldn't it be something if we spent as much time with our face in this book as we did on Facebook we don't get too many amens but that's all right Amen to get the things out of our life to get the junk and the Clutter that's out of our Lives to make more room for Jesus like Elijah told him did this Valley full of ditches and the deeper you dig the more water you'll have and I say to you this morning dig out the fear dig out the unbelief dig the Clutter of the world out of our lives and make more room for the Holy Spirit and when she did this act of kindness for this man of God the Bible says amen that he who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet receives a prophet's reward and the prophet told us that God cares for those who cares God cares for those who care for him the Bible also says as you've done it unto the least of these my little ones you have done it unto me so it pleased the prophet and he wanted to do something for her and Gaza said Master she doesn't have a child the prophet said bring her here and he said next year according to the time of life you will have a child and the next year according to the prophet's word she had a child and when this boy was 11 year old as a Harvest Time and his father and his family was out working in the fields and the prophet of God said he must have had a sunstroke because he grabbed his head and said oh my head my head head and he got sicker and sicker so the the father being real busy he told one of the servants take the boy and lay him on his mother's lap and the servant brought this boy and laid him on his mother's lap and she kept him on her lap till about noon and the breath went out of him and the poor little boy died and she took him and laid him on the prophet's bed now that's a wonderful Revelation she didn't take him to his bed nor did she Place him on her bed nor the father's bed but she took him and laid him in the prophet's chamber oh the prophet's bed Hallelujah because she knew that whatever that Prophet touched was blessed let me say this morning church can you realize just how blessed you are because our lives have been touched by the hand of God we are blessed people this morning he gave us light in the hour of Darkness he gave us peace in the time of trouble rest in the time of unrest Revelation in a time of insanity there's so many questions today that may be true friends I'm not denying that but we have got something that the world don't have the world got questions but we've got the answer you may not have $100 in your pocket this morning but we have riches untone we are blessed because our lives have been touched by the master she said to her husband saddle me up a mule and go forward told the servant now don't you stop if anybody salutes you don't salute them back and go straight to the man of God up at caramel well that's it set your eyes on the go and don't look back don't get sidetracked don't stop don't listen to doubters just keep going amen now our husband think about this her husband where she should have got comfort her husband said to her it's neither New Moon nor is it Sabbath so the man of God won't be there think about that you're wasting your time he's not there it's over just forget it the doctor says it's too far alone the doctor says it's the worst case he ever saw the doctor said you can never get well again oh Hallelujah but do not listen to the doubters keep your eyes on the promise of God's word amen me tell you something brother sister every time you make a move towards God you're going to have discouragers you're going to have hindrances you're going to have obstacles people to try to turn you back to try to get you to give up and to let go but just keep going don't listen to the critics just keep writing get to where the word of God is being manifested think about it friends the discouragement came from her own husband from the home family came these words he ain't there you're wasting your time you might as well quit but you see friends the devil don't care if you come to church if you set like a zombie he don't care if you come to church and sat like you're dead he's always here amen the devil always comes to church more than most message people do amen he'll make you sick he'll discourage you he'll turn you aside anything to keep you from coming then he'll show up himself to aggravate those who did come he's going to preach all day I ain't going to preach all day I promise you I ain't going to do it so you can relax amen we face all kinds of obstacles but we're here maybe you had to battle with everything in you to get here but you're here and while you're here get what you need from the master this morning don't let the devil rob you how many times has Satan come right Among Us and robbed us of Joy robbed us of Victory robbed us of healing I say no more we are children of the most high God this is our heritage amen hallelujah amen when she got to where Elijah was Elisha was and he seen her coming he said go ask her is it well with thy husband how'd he know they had a fight is it well with thy husband is it well with thy boy is it well with thee her son was laying dead on the prophet's bed she had just had an argument with her husband on whether to go or not go you know it's always hard to amen when you fight on the way to church put up your angel wings I know you human this this morning they had a disagreement perhaps she left upset her boy was dead her husband tried to discourage her and now she's in the presence of the prophet and he said is it well and she said it is well I like that all is well because because she is in the presence of the Prophet amen and if she can say that this morning I say to you how much more confidence ought we to have this morning standing here in the presence of the one who sent the prophet I can stand here and say all is well this morning because I am in the presence of Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah oh saints of God I say to you this morning all is well you may be having trouble but all is well you may be sick but all is well you may be having great difficulties but I say to you this morning all is well because we are in the presence of Jesus Christ when she came to the man of God to the hill she called him by the feet but Gesa came near and thrust her away even after she got to the man of God she was facing hindrances oh my goodness how the devil fights and he's a loser how many times do we quit and we're a winner he wouldn't stop she got up to the man of God and grabbed him by the feet and here come the prophet servant get away from the man of God Hinder obstacles discouragers doubters but you know what she said she didn't look at the situation she looked to the solution and I say to you this morning as long as you look at that crooked arm as long as you look at that arthritis as long as you look at that Blind Eye it'll always be blind amen but I say don't look to the symptom don't look to the problem look to the one who has the answer amen he's able to open blinded eyes he's able to make the lame walk how do you know I've seen Ed myself he's the same yesterday today and forever God didn't stop healing when brother brandom died he just changed this MK the same God that was with William Brandon is with the bride today amen hallelujah trying to behave in the South we get a little excited but I know you're maybe a little bit different out here in West Hallelujah Hallelujah she caught him by the feet Gesa came near and thrust her away and the man of God said let her alone for her soul is vexed within her and God hath hid this from me and he hath not told me you know what that tells me contrary to what some people preach around this message God does not tell His prophets everything he only tells them what he wants them to know Amen brother darl thank you whoever said that God bless you he asked Ezekiel can these bones live what did Ezekiel say Lord God thou knowest I don't know Lord but you know let me tell you something I don't know what tomorrow holds I don't know what 20201 is but I know the one who holds it amen hallelujah glory to God hallelujah he said the Lord has kept this for me I do not know and she said to him did I desire a son of thee did I ask you for anything when I made that place for you to rest did I ask you for anything I never said it you said it I never asked for a son you said I would have a son oh hallelujah hallelujah I said do not deceive me and he said to Gaza G up thy loins and and take my staff in thy hand and go thy way and if anybody slutes you don't just salute them back if anybody ask you how you doing don't even answer them just keep on going and lay my staff upon the face of the child what an unusual place to put a staff on the face of a child take my staff don't salute nobody and lay it on the face of the child that sounds pretty good but not for this mother the mother of the child said as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee Hallelujah I'm not letting go I'm not going to satisfy for a servant with a staff I want the one who gave the promise amen I'm in your presence I'm not leaving you I'm holding on I'm not letting go you said God would give me a son you spoke a son for me what if you spoke a son for me what you can speak it again amen if God's ever touched you one time has he touched you if God's ever touched you one time can he not touch you again if God ever healed you one time can he not heal you again amen if he ever delivered you once can he not do it again then what are you worried about we serve a God who turned water to wine that's pretty good he turned water to wine and my question to you is how many times does God have to do it before you believe it didn't not the magistrate of the wedding hold up this wine and said let me make a statement usually at these weddings I've been to a bunch of them usually at these weddings they serve the good wine first and then when everybody's drunk they give them the cheap wine Nobody Knows the difference but not this man not this man he has saved the best wine for last go I have never tasted wine so good is this you know why cuz this wine wasn't made by a man this wine was made by our God Amen he turns water into wine he turns rain Into Sunshine he turns death into life he turns sickness into Health he turns Sinners into Saints amen that's my God this morning that's the God I serve this morning amen Elijah seen he had her on his hands there was nothing else to do but go with her oh my if you'll just stay with the Holy Spirit like she stayed with Elisha she grabbed him by the feet and she wasn't letting go she was holding on she was on his hands and you stay on Jesus hands like that where'd you get that at it's a quote that's what the prophet said you stay on his hands like she stayed on his hands stay on the hands of Jesus if he loves you enough to bring you this message if he loves you enough to bring you to Tucson Tabernacle don't he love you enough to see you all the way through if he touched you once he can touch you again amen hold on oh the prophet said I like that take a hold of God for something and don't turn loose that's right just hold on to him if you're holding on to him for sickness just hold on to him for your health Don't Let Go amen well brother dar it's been a week what's a week to God what's a month to God what's a year to God Congress up 66 years in a wheelchair how many people gave up that that man would ever walk again how many people in his family gave up to the fact he'd ever stand on his feet again but God moved upon Congress and Upshaw 66 years later and a man who had been paralyzed from a young boy stood on his feet and walked out of the meeting just be found believing God when the angel comes by to visit oh my that's right just hold on to him if you could take a hold of God's agent God's agent then was Elisha God's agent today is the Holy Spirit hold on to it if You' ever come in contact and you feel the Holy Spirit on you then hold on to it I'll not leave you stay like Jacob did he wrestled with an angel of God all night long I'm going to hold on to you till you bless me and give me the things that I desired I want you to notice it wasn't it wasn't Jacob that was saying let me go it was the angel it was the angel said let me go it's getting daylight I've got to go and he said no sir I'm not let you go till you bless me I'll not let you go till you give me that which I have need of oh Hallelujah God give me Grace to hold on to him like that angel said let me go he said I'll not let you go I like that the prophet said hold on to him that's right stay on out with him you see her faith wasn't in the staff it was in the prophet she said as the Lord God your lord God liveth and never dies and your soul never dies I'm not going to leave you I'm going to stay right here if you take Jesus for your healer don't you never let no devil or nothing else ever back you out of it ain't it something people will hold on to God until the doctor says that there's no hope and then they give up that's the time to hold on even more so the woman with the blood issue 12 years she went to the doctor 12 years she bled but when she spent all of her money and the insurance ran out then the doctor said he couldn't help her that wouldn't have been nice if he told her the first day you know the amazes me how people put so much faith in doctors I've got nothing against doctors friends I used to work with them but I'll tell you one thing about doctors they bury their mistakes and I've seen a few of them nobody means to do it but it happens I've been in surgery when it goes wrong and the patient dies on the table nobody wants that but it happens but people put so much Faith well the doctor said it's the worst case he ever saw but what you don't know is he told the person before you same thing and people put so much faith in their doctor but remember out of the class of 100 somebody finished last and it might be your doctor amen do you believe in doctors absolutely do you go to doctors yes I do do you yes I do but when the doctor says he can't help me no more brother I know somebody who can I've got another doctor on the case his name is Doctor Jesus and he's never lost the case and when the doctor says I can't help you you know what that means to me it's just another chance for my God to do a miracle and show me just how big he is amen oh Hallelujah I like that front of her there's plenty of room to preach amen amen don't let nothing talk you out of it stay right with it stay right as the Lord your God lives and as your soul never dies I'll not leave you till I find out about my baby and when Elisha couldn't get rid of her he went with her and that's the way you want to be with Jesus you want to get on his hands just stay there cry out day and night and that's the way yes sir don't you turn loose don't you back up one bit if you believe it and stay there there's Mercy in the Lord stay with it you need the Holy Ghost cry out for it you need healing cry out for it ask the one who's able amen don't you remember Jesus teaching about the unjust judge and how this woman constantly knocked at his door day and night she wouldn't leave him alone he sent her away one day she was back the next day constantly knocking on the door she was persistent he turned her away one day she'd come back the next day you know what he said I neither fear God nor man but This Woman's driving me crazy everywhere I look she's there I go in the kitchen she's looking through the window I cannot get rid of this woman I either fear God or man this woman torments me and that's the way you want to get with God be on his hands every morning be on his hands every night Lord I'm just a knocking I'm just knocking what does the Bible say ask and you shall receive seek and you shall find knock and the door shall be open to you I wonder friends the Bible says we have not because we well God knows my heart I know he knows your heart but sometimes he wants to hear your words it's a shame amen it's a shame we took sweet hour prayer and turned it into a little talk with Jesus well glory amen amen don't knock just a little while well my NS are getting sorry I guess I better quit no Lord I'm here I'm not going to leave I'm on your hands now Lord I'm going to stay right there Lord yes sir you may be get tired of knocking you may get tired of listening but I'm not getting tired of knocking because I know you're going to answer because you said in your word if I knock you will open the door well brother Dar I tried that and God just don't hear me that's a lie you're letting the devil lie to you the Bible says in Jeremiah 33:3 calling un to me sayith the Lord and I will answer thee that's a promise from God and my daddy don't lie amen well I prayed and he didn't answer well just keep on praying Just Keep On Believing just keep on asking just keep on knocking just keep on seeking because we serve a God that's any moment is able to turn the situation around you remember the women in Chicago one had a Gorder and the other had stomach trouble they passed through the platform the prophet of God pronounced them both well they go back to the home they lived in the same neighborhood woman with the stomach trouble got no better she kept testifying you know what her husband said I want you to stop testifying because you know well you're embarrassing us you say that God healed you and you're just as sick as you ever was you know what she told her husband listen dear that man didn't know where I was from and he told me where I was from he didn't know what was wrong with me and he told me what was wrong with me he didn't know my name and he told me my name and then that same man told me I was well if he knew all that then he knows this and she kept testified she kept testifying and one morning the prophet of God said she got up to eat some oatmeal or something and it stayed down and the stomach trouble was over and she run to the door and knocked on the door and the woman with the Gorder was screaming and said she was faning the sheets looking for the Gorder you know what the prophet of God said it was the angel of the Lord was passing through the neighborhood to pronounce the blessing let me tell you something Saints he may be on your neighborhood this morning just be found believing just be found holding on as in Romania here a few years ago and a young girl had no hi came up for prayer she came up on a Friday night and repented of her sins she went out Saturday morning got healed got baptized in the water she came back Saturday night she had no hip socket in which she walked with a crutch her leg just swung she had to stop it with her hand she came up and she Saidi want the Lord to heal me she said I want to have a husband said who would marry me like this I said sis you take this handkerchief right here you put it under your pillow and when God heals you you send it to the pastor and tell him to send it back to me as a testimony of what God done for you I said I want you to go everywhere and tell the people that God healed you two or three years went by and I get an email from this girl whose name is Christina she said brother there I've been trying to find you said I got your email address off somebody that goes to your church she said I did what you told me to do brother darl said I went everywhere testify I go to Young people's meetings I'd stand up and testify said even my friends started complaining and said I was in this meeting brother Daryl said I stood up to testify and said I want to testify what the Lord's done for me and said one of my friends said here she goes again she said I want to thank God for healing my heal and she said brother darl when I said that my hip popped and I threw it on the crutch and I walked out of church just be found believing amen I was in Ohio at the Youth Camp a few years ago and a brother from Romania come up to me said brother darl have I want to talk to you about Christina I said oh yeah I know Christina he said brother darl I was in the meeting I was standing just behind her he said I saw her leg straighten out just be found believing well glory be to God oh hallelujah amen just be found amen that's when something happens he has to get you off of his hands see he comes out to answer you Faith finds this Faith holds on faith Hallelujah has a grab that does not let go the widow woman was Avenged because she cried out how much more will God give them the Holy Spirit who wants it who'll cry out for it day and night you want the Holy Ghost cry out for it believe God for it got faith to believe in God that God can do it and will do it let's take a hold of it don't let go stay right with it if it don't come now it'll come 10 minutes from now it'll come an hour from now two weeks from now a month from now it does not matter our God even when we think he's four days late he's still right on time amen amen I'm going to take a hold of God's promise and I'm going to hold on to it listen to this quote can I have a little bit I don't know have much time but listen to this quote right here the Bible says they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover now that's the word of God the word of God does not fail now listen to this quote but the outside world wants you to believe as soon as you lay hands on the sick that crippled leg must be straight you must jump up and down so the outside world wants us to believe that when a person with a crippled leg or a crippled arm comes up to the Altar and a man prays for him or the church prays for him that instantly that's supposed to straighten out and they're supposed to jump up and run out of the church screaming and shouting well that's wonderful that would certainly be a miracle but you see God never said that the prophet said he never promised that he said the prayer of faith shall save the sick and God will raise them up but he never said when they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover but he never said whenn just hold on to the promise just be found believing the promise he said when you pray believe you receive it and it shall be given to you but he never said with that's the Bible friends that's the Bible but we want the outside world to add their ideals to the word of God and when you mix it you've got a hybrid faith you see when you mix Faith with doubt when you mix Faith with fear you've got a hybrid faith and it will not produce the results but if you just simply take God at his word and believe it and testify of it you will get well am when I don't know but Abraham waited 25 years Y at least wait 25 days we can't wait 25 minutes because of Instagram Amen brother down preach think I believe it will we're the most impatient generation they are on the earth if we can't get the oatmeal packed open we want to throw it down well Glory I'm going home I'm going soon amen like Elijah and Elisha Elijah laid that manle on Elisha while he was plowing in the field and the Manel did not fit Elisha but Elisha wanted the Manel so he gave up the plow and he took off after Elijah he was not leaving Elijah until he got the metal and Elisha held on how many knows how long anybody know oh my goodness does anybody know 10 years Elisha held on for 10 years walked with Elijah but you see God never cut the robe to fit Elisha but the 10 years of walking with the prophet's message what did it do it shaped Elisha to fit the manle and let me tell you something brother and sister God will never cut this message to fit your ideals but he will cut you and mold you and shape you to you fit the message amen amen he wanted that metal he never altered that robe friends amen but he altered Elisha to fif the robe God made the robe perfect he's got to bring us into that real to make us fit the robe the Bible says being confident of this very thing that he which have begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ what are you saying I'm saying this he never brought us this far to leaveing us he never taught us to swim to let us drown he never lifted me up to let me down and he never built a home in me to move away but the Potter when he picks up the clay if you'll ever study about the Potter when he picked up the clay do you know he never laid it down it never left his hand God has picked us up into his hand he will not lay us down till we fit the image that he had of us in his before there was a star in the heavens Oh Glory to God Amen what did Elijah tell Elisha he said the Lord has sent me to bethl I want you to stay here you know what Elisha said as the Lord liveth and as my soul liveth I'll not leave Thee I ain't standing no bethl I'm going with you and they went to Jordan and you know the story they went to two three different places and Elijah kept saying you need to stay here you need to let go I I've got to go on Ela said I'm not leaving you I am not leaving you I'm holding on and they come down to the river and Elijah took the mantle and he took it and he struck the water and the water parted and they went over both of them and the water closed behind them and now they was in a secret place and Elisha Elijah said you've asked what do you want of me he said I want a double portion of your spirit what God gave you was good but like the man eating watermelon there's got to be some more of that somewhere I want what you've got but I want a double portion and Elijah said thou has asked a hard thing but nonetheless if you see me when I go you can have what you asked for what did it caus him to do it cost him to hold on it costus a singleness of eye a singl of heart a singleness of Faith a singl of mind he had to keep his eye on the promise and I say to you my brother my sister keep your eye on the word stay with the message of the hour don't get on the internet look at all these nonsense and bunch of people walking away from this message stay with the word amen you know the story when Elijah went up Elisha said you promise me 10 years 10 years of walking with the prophet he goes over and he picks up The Mantel and he puts it on it fit it fit he goes down to the same river with the same mounting with the same manle with the same God and he struck the water and you know what he said where is the god of Elijah he wasn't asking a question he was making a statement that the God that was with Elijah th now rest on Elisha don't you see my brother my sister what our lord Jesus has done he said his Spirit up on high but on the day of Pentecost down came the manle amen hallelujah and what is he gave the church a double portion of the spirit say John 14:12 the works I do shall you do also and Greater Works than the shall you do you can't do nothing greater than raise the dead but what does that mean it means more why because when Jesus was here it was one man in one body doing the works now it's that same Jesus in a many membered body around the world making himself the same yesterday and forever and the church picks up the manle and we cry out where is the god that was on Jesus Christ where is the power of his resurrection I'll tell you where it's on his people oh Hallelujah glory to God do you love him I want a double portion you see God likes to give you just just as much as you've got faith to receive you see when you ask God for big things you know what you're telling God I believe you're a big God Amen God won't run out he's got plenty of blessings just hold on to the just hold on to the promised RS he h on till the manle was his oh soldiers of the Cross just keep soldiering on just keep pressing on don't give up Don't Turn back don't let go I'm discouraged brother Dar but hold on to Jesus the doctor says it's bad brother Daryl but hold on to Jesus don't look at the situation look at the solution Look to Him grab a hold of the promise like that black girl in Memphis let's look at this just before we close her Daddy had heard on the radio that a man up in Ken Missouri had his eyesight restored to him that morning her father got the money together and they called a bus from Memphis Tennessee to Jonesburg Arkansas I was just there last weekend I was thinking about this as I was passing through Jonesburg to get up to where the meeting is there's so many people there they can't even get to the church and her daddy tells this blind girl you stay right here I'm going to go find the Healer and I'll bring him back to you but the crowd moving around bumped the girl and she lost her place and she was blind and now she was in the crowd just moving through the crowd blind and she was crying would someone help me please would someone please help me but everybody was more concerned about their self than there was this poor black blind girl so they paid her no attention now the prophet of God was inside he said he drank orange juice stayed at the pull pit day and night because he promised he would pray for every person but he said at the end of eight days there was more to pray for than they were at the first day because word got out that people were being healed and they come from everywhere and they come and got the prophet of God and took him out to an ambulance where a woman was laying dead and the prophet prayed for the woman and she raised up and they took the prophet out of the amance and said brother Brandon we'll never get you in the way you come perhaps you can get around this way and he was passing through the crowd trying to get back in the building and all those people he were passing through was there to see him but the sad thing of it was they didn't know who he was and he was saying excuse me I didn't mean to step on your toes I'm I'm trying to get back around the back here and maybe some of them had an attitude would you get out of the way I'm trying to get in there and see this man and the one they wanted to see was passing right in front of them I wonder how many times Jesus has passed right by you I wonder how many times Jesus has sat in the Pew beside you and you fail to recognize him because you didn't see the way he would come in this day you see you got to know where he's at he said a little while the world will see me no more but ye shall see me for I'll be with you even then where's he at he's right here with us now friends you know everybody's wearing masks now right I went into a store the other day to get something to drink this man must have come there quite a bit and he walked in the store and she said hey you've changed your mask and when she said that I about had a spell because you see that's exactly what the Lord Jesus done he just changed his mask I wonder what he looks like today brother Daryl you he was passing right through him brother and they didn't know it and he gets around there and he hears this girl and he stands so she would bump into you she said excuse me sir he said what are you doing she said I'm trying to find my daddy said I'm blind I got cataracts on my eyes I can't see said he told me to stand there said he go get the Healer said now I've lost him and I don't know where he's at and I'm blind he said you're here to see what she said I'm here to see the Healer he said surely you don't believe in something like that as many fine doctors as we have today she said but you see sir they can't help me oh God I'm so glad when my little girl was blinding from the accident was struck by a train and the doctor stole me she'd never see again I'm so glad that I knew a doctor who could change the situation with the doctors couldn't help her I knew what who could he said you don't believe that do you she said I tell you watch sir her if you get me to where the healer is is I'll find my daddy myself and he said perhaps I'm the one you want to see she said what's your name he said brother Brandon she said you're the one I want to see he said now I'll pray for you if you don't tell anyone I'll pray for you if you'll believe said she grabbed a hold of my coat and I said if you'll just take your head she he said I couldn't put pull her hands off of me she was holding on for dear life and I said I can pray if you'll believe and she said that's all I ask you to do and he said I begin to pray for her and she begin to scream ran out there throwing people left and right and fell down and said ah who was once blind can now see and the prophet said there was a man standing there with a Twist up club foot had a stick in his hand and he said I know who you are brother brandom I've been standing here three days in the rain just to be prayed for that's holding on friends I've been we can't sit in church 45 minutes not three days I was over in the RV SI te just waiting on the opportunity no he wasn't in an RV he wasn't in an air conditioned room he wasn't in a baded view in a beautiful church he was standing in the rain three days what can God do when we come to church with that kind of attitude stand three days in the rain if you'll just ask God he'll heal my foot I said BR brother if you believe that Jesus died and rose again the third day to make all these things possible hand me your club and when he hand me that club he wasn't just getting he meant it I seen with my own two eyes that Twisted club foot come straight and he jumped up into the air and begin to scream four men rushed around me but people mothers with the little babies trying to get in close enough just to touch that old ragged coat and God was healing them it wasn't the Ragged coat nor was it the one who was wearing it it was the Lord Jesus that's here in this building this morning honoring their faith and if he honored their faith that same Jesus will honor your faith this morning amen if your faith can declare he's here then let your faith go to hold on to him amen you said brother Dar but what if I let it go and it won't work it'll never work if you mix it with doubt just let your faith hold on to the promise of God for your need don't worry who's beside you don't worry who's in front of you Jesus Christ is here here this morning just reach out to him the same Lord Jesus that opened that blinded girl's eyes in Memphis Tennessee was the same Lord Jesus that opened the eyes of that blind beggar is the same Lord Jesus that opened my daughter's eyes in 1995 and let her see again and that same Lord Jesus is in this building this morning to make every person well who will believe feel are we in trouble sometimes yes we are friends some of the most discouraging times we've ever seen But I say to you don't look to that don't look to what's happening look to the one who has it all in control my little girl was blind and I closed she set her I set her on my lap I said do you see me Jessica and she talks real slow from her brain injury she was thrown from the car two of my family was killed in the accident we was recovering and she walked again and she talked again and she started eating again but her eyesight was not coming back and I set her on my lap and I said Jessica can you see me she said no Daddy I can't see you I said but you will you will see me again because God provided a lamb for your eyes and I asked her every day and every day she said the same thing brother I can't see you Daddy I said but you will I just couldn't L my fact my baby is going to be blind I'd go into a little room I'd lay my head against the wall and I'd cry out to God don't let my baby be blind I I sit on my La I said can't you see me one day she said not yet d I don't see you yet but I will see you because you said so and I went to this little room and I closed the door I said God why can I not believe you like my little girl believe me why do we always have to doubt and wonder and figure it out why can't we simply with that childlike Faith believe what daddy said Daddy said he'd heal us daddy said he'd save us daddy said he'd send us a elah daddy said he'd give us the Holy Ghost daddy said he would take us in the Rapture daddy said that all things work to the good that's what Daddy said and I say to you this morning my brother my sister just hold on to the promise just be found believeing do you love him this morning may the Lord bless you richly just hold on oh can you imagine for can you imagine that night at the shite woman's house oh they were singing they were shouting they were rejoicing because the little boy that died at noon on her lap was sitting at the supper table eating ravioli eating something because the Lord Jesus through his servant touched the little boy and that same Lord Jesus is here through his agent called his body this morning to meet the same needs do you love you today let's just bow our head oh Lord I'll never forget Lord the day we brought Jess got home from the hospital 67 days in the hospital and we came home and all the people that was there to welcome us home and all the news people that was there and putting it on the Evening News the miracle girl came home but Lord when we closed the door and it was just us how our hearts rejoiced because you had restored my family back to me and oh God you're the same I can't thank you enough lord I can't love you enough for doing that Lord maybe there's some here this morning that needs to be restored maybe they're just about give up Lord seem like nothing's happening for their good maybe they're thinking about walking away maybe some your person's going to take education over the word of God God there's nothing wrong with education but when it speaks against you we'll stay with you Lord father maybe there's one here who's P they've practiced sickness for years Lord this habit they just cannot seem to get rid of but oh God this morning may they look to you the same Lord God who did these miracles of old God I'm so glad we don't have to go back to 1965 to find out something that you done but you're doing it today Lord just a few weeks ago over at North Carolina at brother Smith this church you healed his mother of a torn rotator cuff right there in the service God completely restored it all how the Saints rejoiced because that's our God you do all things well father God if you can heal in North Carolina you can heal in Jonesboro Arkansas you can heal in Tucson Arizona father I pray today in the name of Jesus by the same anointing that raised my Lord from the Grave by that same anointing that gave my daughter back to me May that same anointing today dear God I pray move upon this congregation Lord that Allegiance will be to you today Grant it father I pray in Jesus Christ's name whatever heads bowed here just a moment friends not to point you out i' never want to embarrass you but I believe my God's A Healer and a deliverer I saw a man who had a cancer on his ear let the power of prayer the next morning there wasn't even a scar where the cancer was I seen a man in Mexico with a diabetic ulcer that had ate into his bone and we preached that night of a checkbook the bride's checkbook and the man wrote a check and sent it up three months later I was back down in Mexico Madam Morris Mexico and the man come running up and pulled up his pants leg it was completely healed that same Lord Jesus is here this morning friends and if you're here and you have a need whatever the need would be financial trouble mental trouble physical trouble sickness fear oppression depression high blood low blood no blood whatever it would be this morning if you believe that he cares for you I want you
