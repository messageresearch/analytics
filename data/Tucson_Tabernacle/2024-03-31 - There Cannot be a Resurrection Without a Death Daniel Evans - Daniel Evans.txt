So Unworthy of such Mercy when he was on the cross I was on his mind you can all have your seats shalom sh English English the peace of God be with you truly the peace of God be with you this morning my name is Mark I wrote a book about the life of Jesus Christ most books about a person end with their death but that's in chapter 15 my book goes on to chapter 16 and we're going to share that with you this morning now when the Sabbath was passed Saturday night after the sun had gone down Mary Magdalene Mary the mother of James and slom bought spices that they might come and anoint the body of Jesus very early in the morning on the first day of the week Sunday morning they came to the Tomb at the rising of the Sun and they said among themselves who will roll away the stone for us but when they looked up they saw that the stone had been rolled away it was very large and entering the tomb they saw a young man clothed in a long white robe sitting on the right side and they were alarmed but he said to them do not be alarmed you see Jesus of Nazareth who is crucified he is risen he is not here see the place where they laid him but go tell his disciples and Peter that he will go before you into Galilee there you will see him as he said to you so they went out quickly from the tomb for they trembled LED and were amazed they said nothing to anyone for they were afraid now when Jesus rose early on the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast seven demons she went and told those who had been with him as they mourned and wept and when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her they didn't believe her after that he appeared in another form unto two of them as they walked and went into the country and they went and told it to the rest but they didn't believe them either later he appeared to the 11 as they sat at the table and he rebuked their unbelief and Hardness of Heart because they did not believe those Witnesses who had seen him after he had risen and he then said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damn condemned and these signs that shall fall they believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents if they drink of any deadly thing they shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen so then after the Lord had spoken to them he was received up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of the god and they went and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word through accompanying signs amen good morning God bless you rep God's not dead he is alive God's not dead he is alive God's not dead he is alive I feel him in my hands I feel him in my feet I feel him in my heart I feel him all over me God not dead he is alive God's not dead he is alive God not de he

something on them I'm going to tell a secret on I'm not going to embarrass you though okay so Daniel after I ministered last Sunday Daniel came up to me and and I know my son and he said uh he said hey Dad how's it going and that means I could care less how it's going but I got to tell you something so he says uh here here's the thing he says you know you were talking about um Taylor Swift in in uh last last Sunday sermon I said yeah he goes here's the thing dad he says he says you know that that um that place is it is a boba is that what it's called that place it's a it's a Boba place he said he says you know that place and and the owner a a Christian guy and I said yeah he says you know they have a car karaoke machine there and I said yeah he said dad last night I sang Two Taylor Swift songs like buddy and he said yeah dad he says and I was like well I said you know I probably wouldn't have said it if I would have known that that you were doing that but that was just the Lord and and when we do something if we make a mistake the best thing that we can do is to correct that mistake amen so d said but Dad while we were there he said that this owner he's a Vietnamese man he said he invited us to sing in his church and I said sing what no so so the actually our young people went to this Vietnamese Christian church and Daniel was taking videos while while they were um fellowshipping and they sang for this church and they blessed this church it was it was you all right the new the numer sisters were there and Daniel was there and I think a lot of them were there and it just blessed this this church to reach out like that so then they go there they went hiking yesterday and they they had the the youth together and they came here and practiced and then they went back last night to the Boba te place and Daniel took some videos when he was there our young people were there with that karaoke machine and they had the whole establishment up and praising the Lord and and dancing to the spirit of the Lord singing gospel songs I'm so proud of you all yes let's keep this going you know it's we've everything's been going so well and the Lord's been blessing us so much I what I want to say is Satan get out of the way because we just started we're coming and you better get out of the way what a what an exciting time that we live in and on this Resurrection on this wonderful day that happened 2,000 years ago when Jesus came out of the Tomb we have to understand what happened during this time and remember you can't have a resurrection without a death I mean you can't raise something from the dead if it's not dead right and you can't have a death brothers and sisters you can't have death without suffering so it's all part of this great plan and the best times in our lives brothers and sisters are not the good times are not the prosperous times the best times in our lives and many many of us can look back are the times that we were suffering let's turn to Isaiah chapter 53 now this was written 700 years before the prophecy came to pass in this Messiah this man named Jesus Christ Isaiah 53 verse number one says this who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should just desire him so he's saying he's just going to be an everyday young man not even particularly goodlooking maybe like Moses was or like Joseph was in the Bible this is an ordinary man he's despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows and yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before the shears is dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he was and he made his grave with the Wicked the thieves on the cross and with the rich in his death Joseph of arthea because he had done no violence neither was there any deceit in his mouth I wish I could have that testimony amen yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors what a prophecy that was wholly and fully fulfilled in this man named Jesus Christ that came 700 years after the prophet Isaiah prophesied that a man of sorrow and grief and today we celebrate the resurrection of Jesus but last week was Palm Sunday the Bible says he rode into Jerusalem the most important city in the world rode in on a donkey and people were celebrating his arrival like David coming in to the city with the Ark on the shoulders of the Levites and David danced before it was a wonderful time that Jesus came they were they were taking off their garments and they were throwing them down in front of the donkey that Jesus rode on and and with the Palm leaves and singing hosana To The King King but that time fulfilled scripture but as far as Jesus's Ministry it was a very small almost very almost unimportant part if you and I were there we would think that this was my highlight of my life this was the greatest time that I've ever lived that when they finally recognized who I was but it wasn't with Jesus his time his greatest time was yet to come and it would happen within a week a week later after he rode in on Palm Sunday now when he came in it it it was a it was a good day and then during that week things gradually got worse and then it came to the real suffering the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 12:9 the Apostle Paul says this and he said unto me so Paul he couldn't see he had a thorn in his flesh his eyesight wasn't very good he may have been suffering from some sickness and he sought the Lord three times and the Lord said to him my grace is sufficient for thee my my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather GL glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me therefore I take pleasure in infirmities and reproaches and necessities and persecutions in distresses for Christ's sake for when I am weak then I am strong 1 Peter chap 5:10 says this but the God of all Grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect perfect establish you strengthen settle you Ecclesiastes 71 says this a good name is better than precious ointment and the day of death than the day of one's birth it is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting for that is the end of all men and the living will lay it to his heart sorrow is better than laughter for by the sadness of the of the countenance The Heart Is Made better the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning but the heart of fools is in the house of Mirth I don't think when we read this and we we read of of the The Passion of Christ this this week that that Jesus went to I don't believe that the Lord wants us to suffer I don't think that's the point I don't think he he wants bad things to happen to us it's like if you know like going to going to my wife is like hey honey I got a $1,000 bonus today oh I'm sorry honey I'm I'm really sorry we we should we should lament that no good things are good things and he doesn't it doesn't say it's like hey uh hey honey remember that speeding ticket I got the other day our insurance went up 25% yes we're going to suffer for that one that's really good yeah the dog died this morning that's not that's not what he wants that's not what it's about but it's during those low times that God really speaks to us human nature brothers and sisters human nature requires suffering our nature gravitates towards sin and God uses the suffering that we have to perfect us even you go all the way back to the Book of Genesis and you look the first thing God says do whatever you want but don't do this one thing look at the nature of a human being goes directly to that one thing that he said not to do it's the nature of a human being to go towards sin and it's the good times when times are easier and we have we have memories maybe of having more money or or having a little bit better job or an easier time of life most of the time that that our lives don't make any changes we only make changes maybe for the worst in those times but the best times the good times are not associated brothers and sisters with positive change wow in fact the good times are the hardest times to change it's in the hard times that we make changes in our lives like the Rich Young Ruler things were going really good for this young man he had a lot of money everything was good he had a high standing in the church everyone respected him and he sees this man who people were calling the Messiah and a prophet and he sees this this he hears his teaching he says oh this man is great and he knew that this Jesus something about him was associated with eternal life so this Rich Young Ruler goes to the Lord he bowed bows down before him he pays him respect and he says what must I do to obtain eternal life and Jesus looked on him and loved him there was something about this young man Jesus saw he said you haven't suffered things are too good and he said sell everything that you have give it to the poor and then come follow me because this young man hadn't had any problems in his life there was no there wasn't that great character that was there so then he he goes and he the man was grieved and he couldn't do it he had a chance maybe to be a disciple we don't even know his name if he would have made the right choice yes he would have suffered yes there would have been problems s but instead the next time we see this young man he's in Hell lost his salvation and then on the other side there was a beggar named Lazarus that just had nothing in his life that was always struggling and we see that Lazarus when he died he went up right into the bosom of Abraham the Rich Young Ruler he died he went down to Hell we see which is more important the good times and the bad times I was talking with a uh a guy at the gym I've known for a while he's come to church here a couple times he's not he'd be fine with me telling the story he came up to me and I I said I said hey how you doing um and he said uh he said not so good I was like okay um here we go and uh he says you know he said I'm sick of it and I said what do you mean you're sick of it he says you know he says God always sends these women into my life and he said and I get attached to them and and and I I I give them I start talking with them they tell me their problems and I counsel them and he says then they just they then they leave me and I said I said really and I said that's God's fault and he says yeah he says why does he send them into my life if it's if it's not for me if it's just to make just to hurt me just to upset me and I said I said okay I said I knew the answer but I said and how old is this girl he says she's 25 and I said and how old are you 47 I said don't blame God for your bad decisions right we can look at these we can go through life and say oh just because God puts something something comes into my path that doesn't mean to take itow make a decision in your life so he's he's there he says he says what I do he says I talk to these people he says I spend my time and and they they tell me all their problems and I help them and I counsel them and and then he said finally they get they they they don't want to talk to me anymore and then then they just shun me I was like oh yeah takes all your time he goes yeah and I just give and give and give and give and God never gives me anything I was like listen man I've been sitting here for 30 minutes you just got a free counseling session from the pastor and I said what did I get out of this said write a check Tucson Tabernacle make an offering but it's all about me he was thinking about himself and when I told him I said listen I said you haven't gone far enough I said what you should do is you should say Lord if you never want me to have a wife I just want to be in your will if you never want me to have another job Lord just let me be in your will I will do everything that I can to serve you and work as hard as I can but if you don't want it Lord I want your will and I said you're not there yet and I believe this young man I believe young man he's almost my age is a child of God I really do and I think that his time is coming that he's going to have to make a decision he might be forced to make a decision I was talking with another young man's about Daniel's age found himself in jail been there for a little while and I went and visited him and I never met him before he's got a good family he's a good mom got a good brother he's he's he's he's got a good child and he just made bad decisions all through his life and finally this bad the last bad decision landed him in jail and now he's awaiting waiting sentencing and he he was talking to me and I was I was understanding what he was what he was doing and and and he said I said Do you believe God is in all this he goes I know he is he made the wrong decisions all the time until he got put in a jail cell and then he says now he goes he goes Pastor now all I have is time he says I think about the Lord all the time when I now that I'm here but before I was here he says I never thought about him and he says now I'm here and I don't have anywhere else to go and he says now I'm praying and I said brother this is the best time of your life it may seem hard this may seem like the hardest time but it's not it is when it is the hardest times in our lives that God finally can he's knocking all the time but it's the hard times that we finally listen there's a woman Matthew chapter 15 we call her a syap phenician woman she was her daughter was mentally ill her daughter had ma major major problems so she comes to the Lord Jesus let's read it Matthew 15:21 then Jesus went then and departed under the coast of Ty and siden and behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coast and Cried unto him saying have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with a vexed with a devil but he answered her not a word and the disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crith after us so this woman came to Jesus and he ignored her let me tell you she wasn't quite low enough she wasn't quite surrendered enough she wasn't quite at Rock Bottom there yet she was about as bad as it can get but there there was still a little bit more that she had to do all the pride maybe was not out of her yet it's a hard one to swallow but he answered and said I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the House of Israel he looks at her he says look at you you're not even a believer you don't look like us you don't act like us you're not worth my time what would I have done if someone treated me like that it wasn't the case for this woman though her daughter was the most important thing then came she and worshiped him saying Lord help me was she low enough yet but he answered and said it is not meat to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs he's saying do you want to take my time you think my time is worth giving to a dog like you but her daughter is more important than her pride and she said truth Lord yet the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their master's table she says Lord you are my master Lord You're my king I'm not worthy even to sit at this table but I'll take just a few crumbs that fall off then Jesus answered and said unto her oh woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou Wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour so she had reached rock bottom but notice she didn't just sit there and not do anything and then when she came into a little resistance she didn't just say I will it must not be the Lord's will she didn't just say well I'm trusting that the Lord will heal my daughter it's a promise and I accept it brother sister I'm just going to hold fast to that that's not what she did that's the mistake that many of us make we get lazy we're not willing to give everything so that we can receive what we ask for so then God in his kindness and his compassion he will put on this hardship to us put us on our back and then finally he can get through to us and speak to us my children are here I'll tell you the hardest time in our lives with me and Stephanie was when our kids weren't serving the lord and we we would cry and we would pray and and and we we didn't know what to do crying out to God saying Lord I don't care what it is Lord I will I will give everything up I will give my job up I will give my Ministry up I will give it all up and Lord save my kids I don't care what it is wow Lord I am humbled Lord help us and they saved my kids and it was at the hardest time that really we get an answer back and and I remember praying it's like Lord we've homeschooled them we've never missed a service at church I've done everything I've known how to do to just walk this perfect line kept them from the neighbor kids protected them as far as who they hang out with and then I felt like Stephanie and I both got an answer was that my will God speaking or was that your will is that how you think this should be happen is that how you think or have you really surrendered your life have you really fallen down and ask the Lord Lord I don't care however you want to lead me we will follow and that's what these hard times that's what these troubles give us they give us a surrender that's what they gave to the lord it's in the lowest times in our lives that God really speaks to us and that's the time when we respond to him as I said he's always knocking but in the good times in our minds everything's going good that's not when we answer the hard times the worst times they're the greatest times we love hearing testimonies from people that that they go through a hard time time and and then they come out we love that because they went through it as I said you can't have a resurrection if you don't have a death and you can't have a death if you don't have suffering that's what happened in the Garden of Gethsemane Jesus comes down his disciples heaviness he knew what was going to happen he goes and he asks his friends he says can you just pray with me a little bit I didn't think it was that important he gets there and he gets on his knees and he ask the Lord the father remember he was a son he was the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities he was real he knew how it was to suffer he knew knew how it was to feel Temptation he knew what we were going through and there he was with everything on him and he's praying and he's saying Lord let this cup pass from me but thy will be done you think well brother Daniel he uh he was the son of God he should have known he should have known what was prophesied about him he should have known his role in these things that's why maybe it wasn't so hard for him it was hard for him think about you I'm G to ask the church here something how many people here and I want you to raise your hand if this is true how many people here believe that Jesus Christ is their Savior and how many people here are Christians amen don't raise your hand on this next question so if you are really Christians the Bible says I believe is brother ly did you read Mark yeah brother Lyall read Mark at the end there and when Jesus is giving his disciples his people he says if you believe on me the works that I do shall you do also and then in mark 16 he said they shall cast out demons they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so if that's the case then why do we fear when we get diagnosed with cancer wow why is that there anxiety there why do we fear if we're diagnosed with heart disease what says right here there's a prophecy right here for me and I just gra why shouldn't I just be healed well here's Jesus the same way and he's like he's like yeah I know I know what's prophesied of me but do you think the enemy wasn't there every every gun in hell was pointed at him you think that the enemy wasn't coming in saying maybe you got the prophecy wrong maybe maybe you're not this or or all of this this confusion comes in our mind if we don't have enough Faith to be healed how could we ever say that Jes Jesus knew he was the Messiah so it should have been easy for him it was not easy he knew how it was to suffer and then we worry about our kids like like I have like many of you have St John chapter 14 verse1 14 says ask anything Jesus speaking talking to us he says ask anything in my name and I'll do it yet we struggle we worry about our children it's a time of suffering but there's a time when you when you finally you get so low and you just cry out say Lord I don't care I just want your will I just want you I just want to be I just want to be what you want me to be I want to do what you want and there was Jesus in The Garden of the Gethsemane saying Lord whatever your will be done and then he gets up and here it comes the people to take him away they take him as you know to be tried and beaten all of his friends that night you know the ones that we rever so highly Peter and James and John they all ran away they all forsook him every want which fulfilled scripture and here's Peter and he just he just told him at the Last Supper Lord I will never forsake you I will never do it and and Jesus said you're going to do it three times before the next morning Peter you going to do it before the rooster craws and here's Peter and now the the Lord's taken away and they was surely thinking that he could save himself and somebody asked him do you know him and he was afraid he said no I don't even know the guy when this book when these gospels were written you notice one of the most beautiful things about the Bible is they record their mistakes wow they record their own failures and here read out of the Book of Luke and here's here's Jesus or here's here's Peter and he's probably telling Luke here's what happened that night I cut off the guy's ear I ran away from him and then I I forsook him three times they kept asking me I forsook him and then the last time not only when somebody asked me not only did I say I didn't know him I started cussing and then you know what happened there a far off Jesus looked over caught Peter's eye and Peter just was destroyed he started weeping and he he ran off crying the lowest time for Peter the lowest time for all of these people then Jesus is put up on the cross here he is stand up there nailed to the cross still this man he's still getting lower he didn't even reach the lowest yet and the disciples as I said they were giving their testimonies later maybe Luke was writing them down and Peter maybe said yeah I was one of the ones with with that was with Jesus oh you were the one one of the ones that stood a far off you were one of the ones that that were far away from him they didn't have enough courage to be with him yeah that was me it was a low time so there's Jesus up on the cross and there is a man that was crucified next to him that said Lord I'm mercy on me he tells the other one he says he doesn't deserve to be here you and I deserve to be here and Jesus said this day you will be with me in Paradise what was the greatest day in that thief in that criminal's life it was his lowest day wow it was the day that he was crucified it was the day that he was suffering that was his greatest day and it's our greatest times or when we're suffering because that is the time that we can speak to Jesus we were when Jesus died and he he got got to his lowest and it was his greatest achievement he conquered death Hell In The Grave right there he conquered all sin right there when he died who could say that I Lay My Life down many of us could say that brother Leo we can't say I take it up again that was reserved for one man one man with the power to do it how could somebody be dead for three days and then have still the power to take his own life to raise his own life up so here's Jesus he dies and all the disciples they they they they run away and and they're sad and and they don't know what to do and they had already forsaken him really the lowest the lowest point in their entire lives and then they start questioning he couldn't have been the Messiah I saw him die well yeah but didn't he say that he would raise again so easy easy for us to forget the promises of God we might not forget them like St John 14:14 ask anything in my name I'll do it but we just don't think that he's going to do it and here are these disciples struggling going through and and Jesus is put in the Tomb they the disciples go back and and and and they're don't know what to do they're afraid Saturday was a a very very difficult day let's let's read Luke 23 I want to read about that man that was on the cross verse we'll start with verse 42 for time sake and he said unto Jesus Jesus Lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom and Jesus said unto him verily I say unto thee today Thou shalt be be with me in paradise and it was about the sixth hour of the day and there was Darkness all over the Earth until the N 9th hour and the sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst and when Jesus cried with a loud voice he said father into thy hands I Comm in my spirit and having thus said he gave up the ghost so when Jesus died over in the temple there was a curtain and this curtain inside the temple was in this area that only the high priest could go one time a year and then that high priest when he went in there he would make a sacrifice and atone for the sins of the people and then the presence of God would come in to that area into that holiest of holies was covered with a curtain thick heavy curtain and when Jesus died on the cross that curtain was ripped from the top to the bottom top to the bottom if you would have if it would have RI ripped from the bottom to the top any of us could grabbed it and maybe ripped it but it was God that broke that curtain think about that curtain how long was that curtain in the temple we don't know it could have been new it could have been there a year it could have been there for a hundred years we don't know how long that curtain was covering that holiest of holies but that curtain the greatest day of that curtain's life was when it was ripped in wow and it's the greatest day of our life when we are ripped into and we finally surrender to the Lord Jesus then after Jesus had died Joseph Vera got his body and he wrapped it and another man that came to Jesus by night this guy Nicodemus he uh didn't really want everybody to see he was a he was a a priest he didn't want everybody want to see was associated with Jesus but he came with Joseph of arthea because he Joseph couldn't have done it by himself so he takes this body and they wrap it up and I think probably the sisters were watching and I'm like yeah maybe they didn't do such a good job when they wrapped up Jesus so when they saw that then the sisters that same day on Friday remember the the Sabbath starts at sundown they went and they got a bunch of ointment and spices and they got it together and then they were going to go on the first day of the week and they were going to do it again they were going to embalm this Jesus with the spices so he's put in the grave he's there all day Saturday and then on Sunday morning as you saw the play The Sisters go to the tomb and and he's not there they go and tell the disciples Peter and John they run back and they they look in they look in there and he's they like he's gone he's not there Mary Magdalene was probably saying Hey listen he is risen the Bible says it was like idle Tales to them like what he's risen it's like guys he said he was GNA rise Mary believed it but so these brothers are like I just I can't I can't I can't really like digest all of this they were down Luke chap 2 24 verse 13 so while those disciples were talking about things a couple of them a couple of followers of Jesus they go on the road and they're walking to EMAs this town that's right really close there to Jerusalem and behold two of them went that same day to a village called theas which is from Jerusalem about three score furlongs and they talked together of all things which had happened and it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned Jesus himself Drew near and went with them but their eyes were Holden they shouldn't that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as you walk and are sad and one of them whose name was Copus answered and said unto him art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and hast thou Hast not known the things which are come to pass in these days and he said said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet Mighty indeed and the word before and mighty indeed and word before God and all the people and how the chief priests and the rulers they delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel beside all this today is the third day since these things were done we thought he was Messiah but we were wrong he wasn't because he died yay and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the supplier so this morning these sisters were up there and when they found not his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and a certain and certain of them which were with us went to the supplier and found it even as the women had said but him they saw not then he said unto them oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken he said you don't remember what he said you don't remember the promises that he gave gave ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and then the spirit started to build they started to hear the word of God and they started to apply it to their lives ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them all in all the scriptures the things concerning himself and they drew nigh to the village where whether they went and he made as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us like wow this guy is awesome he's special they didn't recognize him yet for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to tr with them and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and break and gave it to them and they eyes were open and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures at the lowest point in these brothers lives they were wrong we thought he was Christ we thought he was Messiah we thought he was all these great things we saw do these Miracles maybe he was just a prophet maybe he was just a good man maybe he was just maybe we were all wrong about this no Copus you weren't wrong he promised these things you just had to get really low before God could really speak to you then Jesus said he told his disciples he made a very strange statement he said take up your cross and follow me these things that I've suffered now you suffer them if you stand for me you're going to be hated so when we get down when we get low and it seems like things are just going so wrong no that's the time that God speaks and it's sad it's sad that the only time that he can speak in a human being's life is when he is so low that he just completely has nowhere else to go there was another guy I was witnessing to and he just wouldn't I was he's like oh you're you're you're wonderful and you're great and and I love all of this and and everything that you've said me it's it's such a blessing told me it's such a blessing from the Lord and and all and everything's just so good and then when he got what he needed I haven't talked to him since he just left just lip service he wasn't low enough but when you get so low that you have nowhere else to go then everything changes imagine that thief on the cross his worst day in his life life was his greatest literally it was greater than the day he was born as the proverb said that torn Veil the greatest day in that curtain was the day that it was ripped in half and torn up what was Jesus's greatest day wasn't Palm Sunday when everyone was singing his praises and everything was good it was when he bowed his head he said father into thy hands I commit my spirit the greatest day is my greatest day because that's the day that all my sins wiped away there was a a young brother that uh he's a good friend I haven't talked with him in a while but he's he's a good friend wasn't living for the Lord he was 20 in his 20s and he's just drinking partying doing what kids do sometimes and and he was just going down the wrong road and had this this girlfriend and and they were just there there wasn't there wasn't much to them but he got invited to a youth meeting and in this youth meeting the Lord started dealing with the young man and they were up at the altar and they were they were worshiping brother Josiah the musicians can make your way up they were they were worshiping and and he felt there was a call that was something was pulling on him and he was he didn't have a job he he was like I said he was he was doing drugs and and drinking and everything was just really bad in his life but there was something pulling on this young man came to the Altar and he was praying all the young people were up there and they were all weeping and and he was just just just everything was coming out and he was repenting and and he was crying on his sleeve of his suit of his new suit that he had bought and he kept wiping himself and and and praying and something inside of him said raise your hand up to the Lord and he looked down at his sleeve and there was snot and everything all over his sleeve he says I can't raise my hand I'm embarrassed everybody will see what's what's on on this he kept praying and something said raise your hand doesn't matter what everybody thinks of you he raised his hand and the Holy Spirit came down and filled the young man changed his life and he never went back from that point and then he went and led that young lady to the Lord now they're married have a beautiful family he was influencer on my son Daniel and his guitar he's a really great guy that a lot of the kids would look up to and he he when he changed then he was able to give something back to the youth he helped my son [Music] that day at the altar when he was as low as he could be then he was able to make a choice that was the best day for him this man that's this young man that's in jail right now let me tell you this is his greatest day he's in the he's in the cell right now what is he thinking about he's probably thinking about a resurrected Lord Jesus he's probably thinking about our conversation from a couple days ago where I told this is your greatest day this is the day that God's going to deal with you so why is Easter important to us why is the crucifixion important when Jesus said take up your cross look what I have done as a sister saying now you go do the same brothers and sisters none of us we have problems those problems are a blessing but none of us has stooped as low or hit as Rock Bottom as Jesus Christ did he knows what we go through if it's a child if it's a [Music] job if it's an attitude if it's a religion if it's a denomination if it's a judgmental Spirit he's he humbled me he humbled my wife with my kids to the point where we said Lord I don't care I don't care what it is I need you God I need [Music] you we need him but he went through it he suffered and he died so that we might live please brothers and sisters if things are going good if you think everything's okay fall down on your knees and thank God for his goodness and surrender your life to him as I said it might be sin but sin comes in many many different forms sin very very plainly comes in self-righteousness s sin very very often comes in judgmental [Music] ways [Music] brother in Christ alone my hope is found he is my life my strength my song this [Music] Cornerstone this Solid Ground firm through the fiercest drought and storm what Heights of love what depths of Peace when fears are still when striving cease my comforter My All In All here in the love of Christ I Stand think about these words in Christ alone who took on flesh amen the fullness of God in heless Fai this gift of love and righteousness scorned by the ones he came to save till on that cross as Jesus died the wrath of God was satisfied for every sin on him was a here in the death of Christ I live Brothers and Sisters Let's worship God now just just let aside everything that's in your life amen let go any type of any type of feelings that you have let go any type of of of thoughts and and ideas about how he should be and just say Lord I surrender to you let this Easter be a time that things change let it be a time that changes in our families let it be a time that changes in us don't forsake Him don't leave him there were two thieves on the cross two of them one on one side one on the other one of them could not do it the other one all he had to do was surrender and say I was wrong I've been a sinner my whole life and I I am ready to give my life to Jesus Christ brothers and sisters not just to go to heaven but because he is worthy he died he went through all of that if for no one else he went through it for me Daniel Evans he went through this for and I will love him for my whole life because he did it and I will preach him and I will lift him up I will give him my life and it's him and him alone any Minister that's worth anything will point to Jesus Christ and this Easter brothers and sisters if there is something in your life that you want to get rid of if there is if there is a dedication that that you want to make and you are welcome to come here at this Altar and make that choice and I would suggest that you do it if you haven't done it Jesus Christ is alive the Easter not only celebrates his resurrection but Easter celebrates his suffering and his death and he did it for me and he did it for you now the least that we can do is give him our lives let's all [Music] stand there in the ground his body lay Light of the World by Darkness slain then bursting forth in glorious St up from the grave he rose again and as he stands in Victory sin's curse has lost it grip on me for I am his and he is mine brought from the precious blood and as he stands and as he stands in Victory sin's curse has lost it grip on me for I am his and he is mine I'm bought with the precious blood of Christ no guilt in life no fear in death this is the power of Christ in me from life's first cry to find no breath I know Jesus commence my destiny no power of hell no scheme of man can ever pluck me from his hand till he returns or calls me home here in the power of Christ no power of hell no power of hell no scheme of man can ever pluck me from his hand till he returns or calls me home here in the power of Christ I [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Stand I would suggest that if you don't know Jesus Christ in the way that you should know him I would suggest that you don't leave this building today until you meet him until you call out to him until and he answers brothers and sisters let me tell you there's Spirits all in this building right now there's the Holy Spirit and there's the spirit of the enemy and it's all
