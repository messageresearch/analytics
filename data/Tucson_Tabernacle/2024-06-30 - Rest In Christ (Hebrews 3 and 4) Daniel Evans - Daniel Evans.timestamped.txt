[47:49] song thank you God bless you you can be
[47:52] seated
[48:01] our Lord is so good brothers and sisters
[48:04] he's he's just he's beyond
[48:08] words I
[48:11] uh I don't know what else to say about
[48:14] him he's just he loves us and and we
[48:18] certainly don't deserve his love that's
[48:20] right we don't deserve anything we
[48:23] deserve death that's right but
[48:27] God didn't want us to die God didn't
[48:30] want us to go to hell God wanted us to
[48:33] be with him for an eternity and and how
[48:36] could
[48:37] we how could we thank him we can't we
[48:41] just Lord I just want to live for you I
[48:43] just want to give I want to give you my
[48:47] heart this um we've been going through
[48:50] this series on the book of
[48:52] Hebrews
[48:54] and it's it's a tremendous book that
[48:58] really it's it's set apart it seems like
[49:02] from all the other um books in the New
[49:05] Testament it's just got a different feel
[49:08] to it it's got a different a different
[49:10] way of of introducing it and and a
[49:13] different way of
[49:15] closing very beginning
[49:19] usually the letters from from the
[49:22] apostles it'll say something like Paul
[49:25] an apostle of Christ to the church at
[49:28] Ephesus but Hebrews doesn't do that it
[49:31] it jumps right in and it it hits
[49:36] with God who at sundry times and in
[49:39] diverse manner spake in times past by
[49:41] the prophets hath in these last days
[49:45] spoken to us by his
[49:47] son by whom he created the worlds and
[49:50] and and he he goes in and and and just
[49:52] has this beautifully poetic way of
[49:56] speaking in in this book of Hebrews and
[50:00] it's it's meant for a purpose and the
[50:04] purpose isn't necessarily just to teach
[50:09] us about the Old
[50:12] Testament but it's to provide
[50:17] encouragement to not leave this faith
[50:21] that these people had had accepted to L
[50:27] understand the book I believe that we
[50:29] have to understand really the audience
[50:34] that it it's being written to and
[50:37] remember this is not too long after
[50:40] Jesus had ascended into heaven and there
[50:44] the message pretty much was only to
[50:46] Jewish
[50:48] people and this letter is written to
[50:54] these Jews that that they really
[50:58] understood the word of God they they um
[51:02] brother Jordan could you turn my monitor
[51:03] down just a hair
[51:06] um they understood the word of God and
[51:10] they they were well versed in the Old
[51:14] Testament and then when they saw this
[51:17] Jesus appear and they they heard this
[51:19] gospel and it says that they had
[51:21] received it from Witnesses of people
[51:25] that were with Jesus
[51:27] and they saw that this lines up right
[51:31] but what had happened with this book of
[51:32] Hebrews and we see it later on I believe
[51:34] it's around in chapter 10 we see that
[51:37] they started to fall
[51:39] away from the faith maybe they got
[51:42] discouraged maybe things weren't going
[51:46] like they thought that they should and
[51:49] this book is written to get them back
[51:56] with a proper perspective that this man
[51:59] Jesus Christ is not like anyone that has
[52:02] ever walked the
[52:03] Earth Hebrews chapter 1 and
[52:06] two
[52:09] separates Jesus from the Angels it
[52:11] separates Jesus from the uh the
[52:17] prophets and now when we get into
[52:20] chapters chapter 3 today he's even going
[52:24] to separate Jesus from the greatest
[52:27] Prophet that the Hebrews had ever um
[52:31] that it was consistent consistent that
[52:35] consensus that Moses was the greatest of
[52:37] all the prophets and even in this
[52:39] Hebrews chapter 3 he's going to separate
[52:42] Jesus even from Moses he's trying to
[52:45] tell them listen don't let these things
[52:49] slip this is really really important
[52:53] what you're learning and this faith that
[52:55] you have accepted in this Jesus it's
[52:58] different than anything that has that
[53:00] you have ever received this really makes
[53:03] it all
[53:04] alive and he the the author of the book
[53:09] he assumes as he's writing that the
[53:13] recipients the audience that they know
[53:16] the Bible very
[53:18] well and so he
[53:21] starts he starts talking and bringing
[53:25] scriptures out of history
[53:29] and one thing brothers and sisters
[53:32] is we need to realize that there is a
[53:37] place for all types of
[53:39] ministry this ministry in the book of
[53:41] Hebrews is very much a Teaching Ministry
[53:46] Jesus when he came he was a teacher he
[53:50] was an expounder upon the word and
[53:52] there's different kinds of gifts that
[53:54] that come to the pulpit some some gifts
[53:56] may have that ability to draw the the
[54:00] the strength out of the people and bring
[54:02] an emotional response that's very
[54:04] important many times it's you sometimes
[54:07] you need that crying at the
[54:10] altar then there's other Ministries that
[54:13] have the gift of healing and miracles
[54:16] and and we need those gifts also in our
[54:19] church and we have seen those manifested
[54:21] here but there's also the gift of
[54:24] teaching
[54:26] brother Ryan and I last week after
[54:29] service we were talking about about
[54:32] these things and and I was telling him
[54:35] that there's
[54:37] different Ministries and there's
[54:39] different gifts for all the people as I
[54:41] just said and there is something about
[54:45] when we come to
[54:48] church and when we
[54:50] leave and something that was said just
[54:54] turns on the light bulb
[54:57] there it's like oh I never thought about
[55:02] that those things stay with you that
[55:06] many times that emotion it it it'll
[55:08] leave after a while but those when when
[55:12] you get a revelation of the word and it
[55:15] comes down and you think oh this is how
[55:18] that applies to my life I've got to make
[55:20] some changes here or I'm going down the
[55:23] right Road I wasn't sure that I was
[55:24] going but now I know I'm going down the
[55:26] right Road and that's that's where that
[55:28] Ministry comes in and it's like this
[55:31] book of Hebrews and I gave a testimony
[55:33] on Wednesday night that I was talking to
[55:36] some young men out in front of the
[55:38] church and I could tell them about some
[55:42] of the Miracles that had happened it
[55:44] didn't really stick but when I started
[55:47] talking about who God
[55:50] is and pulling God out of this Bible and
[55:55] explaining how that God is alive and he
[55:59] does things today and how he wants to be
[56:02] worshiped and that he is The Sovereign
[56:05] Authority and not us we want to put God
[56:08] in the box of our lives and in our
[56:10] understanding of God but God is God he
[56:14] doesn't answer to us so often with the
[56:17] world today we want God to answer to our
[56:20] way of thinking Lord I will I I will
[56:23] serve you or I'll accept you in into my
[56:25] life if it lines up
[56:30] with nobody
[56:33] dying or no Wars and that's what we were
[56:37] talking about on Wednesday with with
[56:39] these young men brothers and sisters
[56:41] that's not God he doesn't answer to my
[56:45] way of thinking he doesn't answer to
[56:46] your way of thinking what we need to do
[56:48] is try to get into his way of thinking
[56:51] and as I was expounding on these things
[56:54] that is what really made a difference to
[56:57] this young man that's what he wanted to
[57:00] know he wanted to know more the
[57:03] theological approach and how that this
[57:05] would make sense in his
[57:08] life and that's when this book of
[57:11] Hebrews was written that's what he's
[57:12] doing he's the author is trying to bring
[57:16] Christ
[57:18] out of history and say here this man
[57:23] Jesus fulfills these these many many
[57:29] prophecies and he makes statements in
[57:33] this in the first just couple chapters
[57:35] he says that that this Jesus he says
[57:38] he's the brightness of God's
[57:41] glory so so and he is the express image
[57:45] of his person so the author is saying
[57:47] listen if if you
[57:49] see this Jesus Christ or you get to know
[57:52] him the once Untouchable God who no man
[57:56] could even look at and live the one that
[58:00] dwells in this unapproachable light with
[58:03] tens of millions of angels surrounding
[58:06] him this one that it was death to see
[58:11] him it was death to go into the holy of
[58:14] holies if you weren't the high priest
[58:16] once a year once a year that one
[58:19] now can be approached and should be
[58:22] approached and we can have a
[58:24] relationship with him
[58:26] him and it's he's saying do you see the
[58:29] gravity of this man do you see the
[58:32] importance of this it's not just being a
[58:34] Christian and seeing that there are
[58:36] Miracles and and and the the gospel was
[58:40] preached to the Sinners it wasn't just
[58:42] that it was a this is
[58:44] God the Eternal being the one that
[58:48] created the heavens and the Earth this
[58:49] isn't a man and he's here he came he
[58:53] died he rose again and now he wants to
[58:56] dwell in
[58:57] people it's just it's an incredible book
[59:03] and as we get into a little bit further
[59:06] the author it's important that we
[59:10] understand some of the stories that are
[59:11] talked about that are referenced in the
[59:13] book of Hebrews they're referenced very
[59:16] um
[59:17] subtly but the recipients knew what he
[59:22] was talking about this man Moses
[59:26] as I said he was according to the
[59:30] Hebrews he was the greatest of the great
[59:32] he was the the the prophet the lawgiver
[59:38] is this Moses he wrote the Torah and the
[59:43] Torah the book of Hebrews expects the
[59:46] reader to understand and to know the
[59:48] Torah very well the Torah first five
[59:51] books of the Bible written by Moses from
[59:53] Genesis to Genesis Exodus Leviticus
[59:56] Numbers Deuteronomy those five books
[59:59] make up the Torah those five books are
[1:00:01] written by the prophet Moses we need to
[1:00:05] understand what those what those are and
[1:00:08] what in Genesis it brings down this
[1:00:12] lineage of God starts as we know with
[1:00:16] Adam then goes down to Seth and all the
[1:00:20] way down through the genealogies down
[1:00:22] through like Methuselah and Noah and um
[1:00:26] and then Abraham and Abraham's a pivotal
[1:00:28] part in this first book of the Torah
[1:00:31] Abraham then Abraham was baren he
[1:00:34] couldn't have children as we
[1:00:36] know and then God promised that he was
[1:00:39] going to make a great nation out of
[1:00:41] Abraham and that he was going to give
[1:00:42] him this promised land so then Abraham
[1:00:45] by a miracle of God in his old age he
[1:00:47] and his wife have this son named
[1:00:52] Isaac
[1:00:53] Isaac has a son named
[1:00:57] Jacob Jacob's name was changed to
[1:01:02] Israel so when we hear the children of
[1:01:05] Israel we are talking about the sons of
[1:01:08] Jacob there were 12 of them the book of
[1:01:12] Hebrews it's very important that we know
[1:01:15] two of those Sons the first one is
[1:01:21] Judah Judah was um when
[1:01:27] Jacob at the end of his life he
[1:01:29] prophesied over all of his sons
[1:01:31] individually when he prophesied over
[1:01:34] Judah he made a
[1:01:37] statement that was interpreted
[1:01:39] interpreted correctly as the Messiah
[1:01:42] would come from the line of
[1:01:46] Judah later on we see that Judah that
[1:01:49] that line went through King David we see
[1:01:52] a prophecy again I believe it was from
[1:01:55] Samuel that said that the son of David
[1:01:58] would be the Messiah so we know that the
[1:02:00] Messiah comes down through that line of
[1:02:03] Judah through David and all the way down
[1:02:06] to the Lord Jesus being the Messiah
[1:02:09] that's one of the ones that we need to
[1:02:11] understand as we're getting into the
[1:02:12] book of Hebrews and the second one is
[1:02:16] this other brother of the twel named
[1:02:19] Levi
[1:02:20] Levi was he was the priesthood
[1:02:26] Moses was from the tribe of Levi Aaron
[1:02:31] his
[1:02:31] brother obviously I mean by default was
[1:02:34] also from the tribe of Levi and and
[1:02:39] Aaron was the first what we refer to as
[1:02:44] the high priest it's very important that
[1:02:47] we understand what the high priest is
[1:02:50] the high priest is the one that he went
[1:02:54] into so Moses built the the Tabernacle
[1:02:57] in the wilderness the tents we had in
[1:03:00] the in the Tabernacle there was a there
[1:03:01] was a place in the very back called the
[1:03:03] holy of holies that is where the high
[1:03:06] priest would go in once a year and he
[1:03:11] would make an offering a sacrifice for
[1:03:15] the atonement of the people and God
[1:03:17] would his presence would come down into
[1:03:21] that area the high priest is the one
[1:03:24] that did that the high priest was he was
[1:03:27] pretty much the boss of of the priests
[1:03:30] he he really was the one that made an
[1:03:34] atonement for the people it's a very
[1:03:36] important part of that so we see down
[1:03:39] through this Li this line of Levi that's
[1:03:42] where the priests that work in the
[1:03:44] temple and the high priest comes from
[1:03:45] that and and Moses and Aaron and down
[1:03:49] over here is the tribe of Judah okay are
[1:03:52] we Square now they're they all of their
[1:03:54] dads
[1:03:56] their dad name name was Jacob also
[1:03:58] called
[1:03:59] Israel and these are where all of the
[1:04:02] Jewish people come from is those 12
[1:04:05] tribes those two tribes are what the
[1:04:08] book of Hebrews concentrates on
[1:04:14] now the book of Hebrews it
[1:04:18] references a few different stories and
[1:04:20] and one of the stories it references and
[1:04:23] and when we get into chapter 3 in in a
[1:04:26] couple minutes we'll talk about this is
[1:04:29] when Moses came do you remember Moses
[1:04:32] was sent to call the people out of
[1:04:35] bondage so they Moses comes and and he
[1:04:39] brings all the plagues and remember the
[1:04:40] death angel cames comes and and uh he he
[1:04:44] tells pharaoh to let my people go I
[1:04:46] think we've probably most of us have
[1:04:48] seen the
[1:04:49] movie it's it's good it's it's good that
[1:04:52] we understand that because it is a very
[1:04:54] very important story so they they come
[1:04:56] out then they go up and they get locked
[1:05:00] up against the ocean God comes down and
[1:05:02] a wind wind blows and parts the ocean on
[1:05:05] both sides they go across they head
[1:05:09] north and remember the promise of the
[1:05:13] promised land and that is
[1:05:16] from even more land than this but about
[1:05:18] the Jordan River over to the
[1:05:21] Mediterranean
[1:05:23] Sea you've heard they say that the um
[1:05:27] the Palestinians are want to destroy
[1:05:29] Israel and they say from The River To
[1:05:31] The Sea and they say well it's ours will
[1:05:34] know my Bible says that God gave it to
[1:05:36] the Jewish
[1:05:38] people
[1:05:39] and there was so they're wandering in
[1:05:42] the wilderness they head north and then
[1:05:45] they're going to cross over this River
[1:05:48] into this promised land so they get to
[1:05:51] this place called Kadesh Baria and they
[1:05:54] send
[1:05:56] spies
[1:05:57] over from each tribe they send spies
[1:06:00] over to spy out this land and they go
[1:06:03] out and it's like wow this place is
[1:06:05] great there's there's grapes and figs
[1:06:08] and and we could really make a good
[1:06:10] living over here and they see though
[1:06:14] there were giants in the land and there
[1:06:15] were great warriors and this land was
[1:06:17] going to be hard to take so they come
[1:06:20] back and 10 of those spies say we can't
[1:06:23] do it we're not able to do it these guys
[1:06:25] are tooo big they got they have these
[1:06:27] big swords that are too much and they
[1:06:29] have shields they're Warriors we can't
[1:06:31] do it but then there was two spies that
[1:06:34] said no yes we can we are able to do
[1:06:38] this so there was a big
[1:06:41] rebellion in the in the in the tribe in
[1:06:44] the uh Camp of Israel and it got so bad
[1:06:47] that they wanted to kill
[1:06:50] Moses and the leaders and they wanted to
[1:06:53] go back to Egypt it grieved God because
[1:06:57] God was imagine put yourself in God's
[1:06:59] place it's like did I not just part the
[1:07:02] Red
[1:07:03] Sea did I not just kill the biggest army
[1:07:08] in the world with one little swipe with
[1:07:11] the Egyptians drown them all did I not
[1:07:14] re Mana from
[1:07:16] Heaven did I not bring water out of the
[1:07:19] rock did I not do all these things and
[1:07:22] you're worried about these few people
[1:07:24] over here and it grieved God it upset
[1:07:28] him it as the Bible will say it provoked
[1:07:32] him to
[1:07:33] anger so we have to remember that story
[1:07:37] in the Bible as part of what is being
[1:07:41] talked about in this book of
[1:07:43] Hebrews and I believe it calls it the
[1:07:47] provocation they provoked God in doing
[1:07:51] this and the Bible is telling us this
[1:07:55] for a warning hey don't you do it now
[1:07:59] God sent you Jesus Christ he sent you
[1:08:02] the Holy Spirit he sent things these
[1:08:04] things to you now you don't provoke God
[1:08:06] like your ancestors
[1:08:09] did so let's get into
[1:08:13] it so in Hebrews chapter 2 God put
[1:08:17] everything in subje subjection to to
[1:08:19] Jesus
[1:08:21] Christ but he was made flesh and
[1:08:24] blood so that he might become a mer
[1:08:27] merciful and faithful high priest I just
[1:08:29] mentioned what the high priest was in
[1:08:31] the service of God to make the propit
[1:08:34] tuation of sins to to be able to make an
[1:08:37] atonement to be able to step in for our
[1:08:43] sins because he Jesus suffered
[1:08:48] Temptation so he is able to help those
[1:08:52] that are attempted all without sin
[1:08:56] but he suffered he knows how it
[1:08:58] feels so basically God came down in
[1:09:01] human flesh he felt the same feelings as
[1:09:03] we feel so he can make an atonement for
[1:09:05] our sins so he gets it more than any of
[1:09:10] us knowing what everybody else is going
[1:09:12] through Jesus understands he knows how
[1:09:15] it feels to be you and me he knows how
[1:09:18] it feels to be tempted he knows how
[1:09:20] maybe lying is a Temptation or gossiping
[1:09:23] or or wanting power or wanting money he
[1:09:25] knows all of that and he overcame that
[1:09:28] so now he can help us overcome it so the
[1:09:32] author is writing this letter to try to
[1:09:33] get the people to understand that Jesus
[1:09:35] is a lot more than a prophet or even an
[1:09:38] angel he's saying that he understands
[1:09:40] our trials he understands our sufferings
[1:09:43] he is this high priest the real one that
[1:09:48] can be touched by the feeling of our
[1:09:50] infirmities that can understand us so
[1:09:53] let's start Hebrews chapter
[1:10:00] three verse one says it says this
[1:10:04] wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the
[1:10:07] Heavenly calling consider the Apostle
[1:10:09] and high priest of our confession Christ
[1:10:11] Jesus who was faithful to him that
[1:10:14] appointed him as also Moses was faithful
[1:10:17] in all his house for this man was
[1:10:20] counted worthy of more Glory than Moses
[1:10:23] in as much as he who had builded the
[1:10:26] house hath more honor than the house for
[1:10:29] every house is builded by some man but
[1:10:32] he that built all things is God and
[1:10:36] Moses verily was faithful in all his
[1:10:38] house as a servant for a testimony of
[1:10:40] those things which were to be spoken
[1:10:43] after but Christ as a son over his own
[1:10:48] house this is my favorite part right
[1:10:50] here I love this part whose house we are
[1:10:54] wow
[1:10:55] If We Hold Fast the confidence and the
[1:10:58] rejoicing of the Hope firm unto the end
[1:11:02] so he's saying that the prophet was
[1:11:04] faithful that Moses Moses was was was a
[1:11:09] faithful and true
[1:11:12] servant but he's saying that Jesus Built
[1:11:15] the
[1:11:16] house and Moses the greatest of all the
[1:11:19] prophets in the in the all the Old
[1:11:21] Testament he was just part of the house
[1:11:26] so the greatest of all prophets was just
[1:11:28] something that was built by Christ and
[1:11:32] Christ should receive the glory for
[1:11:35] everything that Moses did is what the
[1:11:37] author is trying to tell us
[1:11:40] here and the APO the Apostle
[1:11:43] Paul he was Paul was great I mean
[1:11:46] talking about an understanding of the
[1:11:48] word Paul he said he said for I know
[1:11:51] that there is nothing good in me in my
[1:11:55] flesh he said there's nothing good but
[1:11:57] if there's anything that's good in me it
[1:11:59] comes from
[1:12:00] Christ right in line with this verse
[1:12:04] number seven
[1:12:05] wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith today
[1:12:09] if you will hear his voice Harden not
[1:12:11] your hearts as in the provocation in the
[1:12:13] day of Temptation in the wilderness what
[1:12:15] I just spoke about when your fathers
[1:12:18] tempted me proved me and saw my Works 40
[1:12:22] years wherefore I was grieved with that
[1:12:25] generation and said they do always he in
[1:12:28] their heart and they have not known my
[1:12:30] ways so I swear in my wrath that they
[1:12:33] they shall not enter into my
[1:12:37] rest now he's quoting not only is he
[1:12:41] talking about this story that happened
[1:12:43] but he's also quoting a Psalm probably
[1:12:46] written by the by King David Psalm
[1:12:50] 95 verse let's read it because he he
[1:12:53] mentions it two or three times um from
[1:12:55] now Psalm 95:7 he says for he is our God
[1:13:00] and we are the people of his pasture and
[1:13:02] the Sheep of his hand today if you will
[1:13:05] hear his voice Harden not your heart as
[1:13:08] in the provocation as in as and as in
[1:13:12] the day of Temptation in the wilderness
[1:13:14] when your fathers tempted me proved me
[1:13:16] and saw my work 40 years long was I
[1:13:19] grieved in with this generation and said
[1:13:22] it is a people that do he in their heart
[1:13:24] and they have not known my ways unto
[1:13:27] whom I swear in my wrath that they
[1:13:29] should not enter into my rest so this
[1:13:33] Psalm was written after that that
[1:13:35] happened in the wilderness and a
[1:13:37] thousand years before this letter of the
[1:13:39] Hebrews was written and it's referring
[1:13:42] as I said to the Rebellion that was in
[1:13:44] the
[1:13:45] wilderness back to Hebrews chap 3:2 take
[1:13:49] heed Brethren lest there be any of you
[1:13:52] an evil heart of unbelief in parting
[1:13:55] from the Living God but exort one
[1:13:57] another daily while it is called today
[1:14:01] lest any of you be hardened through the
[1:14:04] deceitfulness of
[1:14:06] sin
[1:14:09] remember these words are Eternal they
[1:14:14] are not just for the Hebrews that that
[1:14:16] read this first letter can you imagine
[1:14:19] man you getting that letter
[1:14:21] first and reading these words but now we
[1:14:25] can read them and people have been
[1:14:27] reading them for 2,000 years and they're
[1:14:29] not just for the original audience times
[1:14:33] repeat
[1:14:36] themselves so he's the author is telling
[1:14:38] us that if we truly love one another
[1:14:41] then
[1:14:42] exort one another daily about these
[1:14:45] things because the time is short and
[1:14:48] there will be those whose hearts are
[1:14:50] hardened through
[1:14:52] sin in this building I'm not talking
[1:14:55] about 2,000 years ago with the with the
[1:14:58] recipients of this letter I'm talking
[1:15:00] about today he is commanding us through
[1:15:03] the inspiration of the Holy Ghost to
[1:15:06] exhort one another
[1:15:09] daily all the time while it is called
[1:15:12] today so today do it then tomorrow it'll
[1:15:16] be called today tomorrow when we get
[1:15:18] there do it not yesterday and then two
[1:15:21] days from now it'll be called today
[1:15:22] again and do it again
[1:15:26] how many people have all of us seen that
[1:15:30] desire the world and then that lust
[1:15:33] leads them to a sinful
[1:15:36] life there's there it just it's torn and
[1:15:41] it breaks my heart when I see that
[1:15:43] probably more than anything
[1:15:45] else as as a pastor is just as a brother
[1:15:49] that when someone they just have a
[1:15:52] desire for the things of the world
[1:15:55] they have a desire they they put whether
[1:15:58] it be when you're my age whether it be
[1:16:01] money or
[1:16:04] or business deals or something like that
[1:16:07] or or when they're young whether it
[1:16:09] maybe it's it's sinful living it's clubs
[1:16:12] and sleeping around before you're
[1:16:14] married and and all of those things they
[1:16:16] put that before they put God it's it's
[1:16:19] it's very sad thing to watch but it's
[1:16:22] because that desire of the world is more
[1:16:25] important than that desire for God
[1:16:28] you're going to serve whatever you want
[1:16:30] to serve let me tell you that you are
[1:16:34] going to do what you want to do do you
[1:16:37] want is it a stronger desire for you to
[1:16:39] serve God or is it a stronger desire for
[1:16:43] you to be pulled into the things of the
[1:16:44] world first John says love not the world
[1:16:48] or the things of the
[1:16:50] world for the love if if any loves the
[1:16:54] world then the love of the father is not
[1:16:55] even in
[1:16:57] him so the ath
[1:16:59] author of The epistle is pleading with
[1:17:02] the readers to encourage one another in
[1:17:05] the things of the Lord and don't stop
[1:17:07] doing it so so mothers teach your
[1:17:09] children fathers teach your teach your
[1:17:11] children your wives and your husbands
[1:17:13] and your brothers and your sisters
[1:17:14] always exhorting one another
[1:17:16] daily when uh we were living in
[1:17:19] Jeffersonville i' I've given the
[1:17:20] testimony a couple times that we started
[1:17:22] this boxing gym and we wanted to
[1:17:25] dedicate it to serving God and to
[1:17:29] Leading people to the Lord Jesus to
[1:17:31] showing them that Jesus is real there
[1:17:33] there's it was it was a Ministry to many
[1:17:36] of the down andout people that just they
[1:17:38] didn't have money they didn't have there
[1:17:40] was really just no potential but we
[1:17:42] wanted to give them a chance and the
[1:17:45] chance that they have is through Jesus
[1:17:48] Christ if they can change their lives if
[1:17:50] they can break this
[1:17:52] cycle of just
[1:17:55] not working crime all these things if
[1:17:59] they can break that cycle and make a
[1:18:01] change and get that New Birth being born
[1:18:05] again then they can change their
[1:18:07] families they can then they can have a
[1:18:10] good happy life so we started this and
[1:18:13] we working um we had uh one fighter he's
[1:18:19] uh heavyweight and really really good um
[1:18:24] I think he was I don't know 7 and0 or so
[1:18:26] something like that and uh he actually
[1:18:28] went to Vegas and stayed there for about
[1:18:31] a year or two or whatever it was to
[1:18:33] train there and started fighting there
[1:18:35] really high caliber fighter and what we
[1:18:39] wanted to do was we wanted to have a uh
[1:18:43] like a a grand opening for our gym it
[1:18:46] was we'd been on on the scene for maybe
[1:18:48] six months and we wanted to get the word
[1:18:50] out so we invited the mayor of the city
[1:18:52] he ended up coming and we uh we talked
[1:18:56] about the
[1:18:58] fighting and then we talked um we wanted
[1:19:04] we also invited a sister gym that we had
[1:19:06] in Philadelphia and Tim Witherspoon was
[1:19:10] part um was in that Circle
[1:19:16] probably everyone under my age probably
[1:19:19] are a little bit older than me probably
[1:19:20] doesn't know who Tim Withers spin is he
[1:19:22] was a heavyweight champion professional
[1:19:25] boxer um that was just before Mike Tyson
[1:19:27] everybody knows who Mike Tyson was he
[1:19:29] was he was just a he was a great Fighter
[1:19:32] um so he ended up coming to our uh
[1:19:36] Gathering there and what we did is we
[1:19:38] set up a big tent in Jeffersonville and
[1:19:42] we like I said the mayor was there and
[1:19:43] we had I don't know how many people and
[1:19:47] we had um we had a
[1:19:49] service and we had a tent there and then
[1:19:52] I spoke at the service and I talked
[1:19:55] about sacrifice and how that the
[1:19:58] original sacrifice in the Garden of
[1:20:01] Eden was an animal and how that
[1:20:05] represented Jesus and then I talked
[1:20:08] about how we should give God everything
[1:20:10] and and this Tim Witherspoon was in the
[1:20:13] audience a famous guy um brother Jordan
[1:20:16] if you could show the picture I took um
[1:20:19] here's Tim and and Daniel um and that
[1:20:24] guy on the left he's by the way it's the
[1:20:26] picture's a little out of um perspective
[1:20:28] he's giant he's uh he's about 65 six6
[1:20:33] and just a big guy and then there's my
[1:20:35] little boy right there and and so Tim
[1:20:39] was he was there and I'm just gonna I'm
[1:20:41] gonna brag for just a second it's okay
[1:20:42] to do it because I'm on somebody else
[1:20:45] but so Tim comes in and and he sees our
[1:20:49] Flagship heavyweight fighter and he's
[1:20:51] like oh yeah yeah he's good but who is
[1:20:54] this white
[1:20:55] kid and uh so he's he's watching Daniel
[1:20:59] fight and then he starts saying hey this
[1:21:02] guy right here this young man has got
[1:21:05] something so he gets in the ring with
[1:21:07] Daniel and he's starting to coach him
[1:21:08] and and Daniel's learning some stuff
[1:21:10] from him Tim Withers is some of the
[1:21:13] older folks if if you ever saw him fight
[1:21:15] he had this overhand right that would
[1:21:18] just come like from out of the country
[1:21:22] and just land and just knock
[1:21:24] heavyweights out he was he could hit
[1:21:28] hard and he saw Daniel and he's like
[1:21:31] this kid has really got something and he
[1:21:34] wanted to kind of attach himself to
[1:21:37] Daniel because he saw that that this kid
[1:21:39] has some
[1:21:41] potential and let me tell
[1:21:44] you Daniel my
[1:21:48] son he did have a lot of potential but
[1:21:52] he saw something more important than
[1:21:55] boxing and he made a choice in his life
[1:21:59] boxing is a very
[1:22:00] worldly um profession and and you have
[1:22:03] to go through a lot and and Daniel saw
[1:22:05] that the more important thing was
[1:22:07] serving God and serving God's people and
[1:22:12] you see that my son
[1:22:14] a after you see the Lord working and he
[1:22:17] just wanted to help the help the
[1:22:19] fighters and he would encourage them and
[1:22:22] counsel them and and he was so
[1:22:25] respected that everybody kind of flocked
[1:22:28] to him and he Daniel used that to point
[1:22:32] them to Jesus
[1:22:34] Christ and that's the most important
[1:22:36] thing if God gives us a gift take that
[1:22:40] gift and use it for God it's not your
[1:22:44] gift anyways a gift means somebody gave
[1:22:45] it to you so God gave it to you now use
[1:22:49] it for him and that's this Tim
[1:22:51] Witherspoon so he's he's he's talking
[1:22:54] finished up my sermon and he raises his
[1:22:56] hand and he says I want to say something
[1:22:59] so he comes up to the platform and he
[1:23:02] had already told me this story earlier
[1:23:05] and he said he says my mother was a
[1:23:09] preacher and she always told me jtim
[1:23:13] serve
[1:23:14] God serve the Lord don't you you take
[1:23:18] this boxing it's okay but but make sure
[1:23:20] that you're living for Jesus and he said
[1:23:23] you know she told me that and I I never
[1:23:24] I never thought about it it was just it
[1:23:27] wasn't anything he said but now he says
[1:23:29] I see what you're doing in this gym and
[1:23:31] he says my mom's words are coming back
[1:23:34] to me and he says you're doing right
[1:23:38] what this is about putting God first he
[1:23:41] said this is the right thing to do and
[1:23:43] this is the guy that um he got hooked up
[1:23:46] with um what was the promoter's named
[1:23:48] Don King anybody my age or probably a
[1:23:52] little probably not younger but older
[1:23:55] um probably remembers Don King he was a
[1:23:57] crook but he was he was a promoter for
[1:24:02] like Tim Witherspoon he took all of his
[1:24:03] money Mike Tyson got him all messed up
[1:24:07] he was the guy that had the hair that
[1:24:08] stuck straight up you remember
[1:24:10] him um but he got hooked up with that
[1:24:13] and it just made Tim
[1:24:15] bitter and he and when he was talking he
[1:24:18] says that he says now these things my
[1:24:21] mom telling me he says I see how
[1:24:23] important they are and and Tim he didn't
[1:24:26] have
[1:24:27] money he'd been ripped
[1:24:29] off and he was just he was looking for
[1:24:34] something and I I saw that the Lord
[1:24:36] really used him to speak to these people
[1:24:40] me saying it I'm a nobody but him saying
[1:24:43] it held a lot of weight among those
[1:24:47] people and I I looked at him and I told
[1:24:51] him afterwards I said man God's given
[1:24:53] you another chance
[1:24:55] chance he's he you can do it just serve
[1:25:00] him we talked for a while and and he was
[1:25:03] just such a such a sweet sweet person
[1:25:08] and I just pray that it made a
[1:25:10] difference in his life and that's why
[1:25:13] what I wanted to tell that story is his
[1:25:15] mother exhorted him
[1:25:17] daily always telling him Tim serve God
[1:25:20] serve God and it planted a seed that
[1:25:23] made a difference in his life life later
[1:25:26] on that's this book of Hebrews it says
[1:25:29] verse 13 but exhort one another daily
[1:25:32] while it is called today lest any of you
[1:25:33] be hardened through the deceitfulness of
[1:25:35] sin for we are made partakers of Christ
[1:25:38] if we hold the beginning of our
[1:25:40] confidence steadfast Until the End
[1:25:43] English Standard Version says this for
[1:25:45] verse 14 it says for we have come to
[1:25:47] share in Christ if indeed we hold our
[1:25:51] original confidence firm to the end hold
[1:25:56] strong to what you have learned he
[1:25:58] previously says the author says how can
[1:26:00] we escape if we neglect so great
[1:26:04] salvation he's saying you've been given
[1:26:06] a gift and how can you escape later if
[1:26:09] you if if you just throw it out it's
[1:26:12] more important than you can ever imagine
[1:26:14] it's God
[1:26:15] himself not a high priest not a prophet
[1:26:18] but God the Creator the Eternal one the
[1:26:22] one that spoke a word
[1:26:25] and the world came into
[1:26:28] existence he's saying that this
[1:26:31] man is that man that came this Jesus is
[1:26:39] him while it is said today if you'll
[1:26:41] hear his voice Harden not your hearts as
[1:26:43] in the provocation he's again referring
[1:26:45] to that Psalm 95 and that story from
[1:26:47] Kadesh barnea for some when they had
[1:26:49] heard did provoke how be it not all that
[1:26:52] came out of Egypt by m Moses English
[1:26:55] Standard Version is much easier to
[1:26:56] understand on that for who were those
[1:26:59] who heard and yet rebelled was it not
[1:27:02] all those who left Egypt led by Moses
[1:27:05] he's asking a very important question
[1:27:07] he's saying that the ones who rebelled
[1:27:08] and provoked God were the ones who came
[1:27:10] out of Egypt following the prophet
[1:27:14] Moses they were the ones who
[1:27:17] rebelled wow so just because God sends a
[1:27:19] prophet and you recognize who that
[1:27:21] Prophet is it does not mean that you've
[1:27:23] made it
[1:27:24] you could be the problem like the
[1:27:25] Hebrews were the problem in the
[1:27:27] wilderness who follow and they were the
[1:27:29] ones who were following Moses but they
[1:27:31] didn't do what God commanded them to do
[1:27:34] through
[1:27:35] Moses but with whom was God but with
[1:27:39] whom was he grieved 40 years was it not
[1:27:42] with them that had sinned whose
[1:27:43] carcasses fell in the wilderness so they
[1:27:45] fell into sin they worshiped the golden
[1:27:48] calf they complained about everything
[1:27:50] they were complaining about the food
[1:27:51] they were
[1:27:52] eating and it was fallen from heaven and
[1:27:55] they weren't paying for
[1:27:57] it and they were complaining about it
[1:28:01] they were complaining about the water
[1:28:03] they were drinking and it was coming as
[1:28:04] a miracle from a rock and they were
[1:28:06] provide they were complaining about the
[1:28:08] leadership that God had
[1:28:11] provided you know sometimes we don't
[1:28:13] think our sin's a big deal but we're
[1:28:15] quick to point out sin in the other
[1:28:18] guy one word brothers and sisters one
[1:28:21] word of blasphemy has the potential of
[1:28:24] of never being forgiven one word one sin
[1:28:28] has the potential to send us you or me
[1:28:32] to
[1:28:34] hell that's how important these Stakes
[1:28:37] are that's why this book of Hebrews he
[1:28:39] is trying to say look how important this
[1:28:41] man is and to whom swear he that they
[1:28:45] should not enter into his rest but to
[1:28:47] them that believe not so we see that
[1:28:50] they could not enter in because of
[1:28:53] unbelief
[1:28:54] these are called out people and he's
[1:28:56] saying that even they couldn't enter
[1:28:57] into the promised land because of their
[1:29:00] unbelief and he almost uses sin and
[1:29:04] unbelief
[1:29:06] interchangeably and as we progress to
[1:29:08] the scriptures you'll see that Hebrews
[1:29:11] chapter
[1:29:14] 4 let us therefore lest a promise being
[1:29:18] left us of entering into his rest any of
[1:29:21] you should seem to come short of it for
[1:29:24] unto us was the Gospel preached as well
[1:29:26] as unto them but the word preached did
[1:29:28] not profit them not being mixed with
[1:29:31] faith in them that heard it the
[1:29:34] scripture says it is impossible to
[1:29:36] please God without faith faith in what
[1:29:39] faith in him that not only is able to do
[1:29:42] what he promised but also that there are
[1:29:45] consequences for not doing what he
[1:29:49] commanded for we which have believed do
[1:29:51] enter into rest as he said at as I have
[1:29:54] sworn in my wrath if they shall enter
[1:29:57] into my rest although the works were
[1:30:00] finished from the foundation of the
[1:30:02] world for he spake in a certain place of
[1:30:05] the seventh day on this wise and God did
[1:30:08] rest the seventh day from all his
[1:30:11] Works seventh day the the Sabbath
[1:30:15] believe it's the fourth Commandment says
[1:30:18] to keep the Sabbath to honor that
[1:30:19] Sabbath to keep that day holy when time
[1:30:22] started ticking
[1:30:25] God God separated the light from the
[1:30:27] darkness on on that first day and he
[1:30:31] went through the things that he did he
[1:30:33] separated the the dry land from the
[1:30:35] oceans and and he put the stars in the
[1:30:38] heaven and the moon in the sky and the
[1:30:39] last thing that he did was create a
[1:30:42] human being and after those six days of
[1:30:45] creation then God took some time
[1:30:49] off he rested from all his works on the
[1:30:52] seventh day and God commanded Ed us to
[1:30:54] do the same thing through the Ten
[1:30:57] Commandments the fourth Commandment as I
[1:30:59] said that God gave Mo Moses on Mount
[1:31:04] Si
[1:31:06] but the thing that we always need to
[1:31:08] realize that like almost everything in
[1:31:11] the Bible especi all the Commandments
[1:31:14] they are s they are they're symbolic of
[1:31:17] something else yes they were they were
[1:31:19] given to us to obey and to be practiced
[1:31:22] but there was a deeper meaning Behind
[1:31:24] These
[1:31:25] Commandments the first sacrifice in
[1:31:28] Genesis 3 Adam and Eve Sinn by eating
[1:31:30] the fruit um of the tree of knowledge
[1:31:33] that God had promised that if they
[1:31:36] disobeyed his Commandments that death
[1:31:38] would follow we know the story in
[1:31:40] Genesis 3 so he required something to
[1:31:44] stand in that PL in their place because
[1:31:46] of that sin he says if you eat of this
[1:31:49] fruit then this day you will die so what
[1:31:53] happened
[1:31:55] they did what he said not
[1:31:57] to then God goes He is a just
[1:32:03] God justice justice is not
[1:32:08] forgiveness Justice is if you steal
[1:32:11] money from me you're gonna pay there's
[1:32:13] no me forgiving you it's
[1:32:17] just God is a just God his wisdom his
[1:32:21] Justice
[1:32:24] is wonderful but there's no mercy
[1:32:27] there so he says that if you do this and
[1:32:33] they did it then I will require death
[1:32:36] and then God goes and he kills an animal
[1:32:41] or two and then makes a garment to cover
[1:32:44] their nakedness to cover their sin so
[1:32:47] God takes their sin and he says okay I
[1:32:50] require death now this is going to die
[1:32:54] because you did this and he takes it and
[1:32:57] he clothes clothes them with
[1:32:59] it and here they are and they're they're
[1:33:02] in these
[1:33:03] skins and it represented that death that
[1:33:07] had to happen but the thing is they
[1:33:09] still died it was only a
[1:33:13] representation so it only stayed the
[1:33:15] wrath of God for a little
[1:33:18] while it was
[1:33:21] symbolic and that blood then Abel the
[1:33:26] son he goes and he kills an animal on
[1:33:31] the altar because God had commanded that
[1:33:33] Abel probably saw his sins he had done
[1:33:36] things wrong so he goes and he kills an
[1:33:38] animal because he knew that God required
[1:33:40] death for
[1:33:43] sin and the thing is that we have to
[1:33:46] understand that our sins require
[1:33:52] death and then require our death yes if
[1:33:57] there's no atonement
[1:33:58] there and that atonement cannot be
[1:34:01] provided by an animal anymore it never
[1:34:03] could it never worked they still
[1:34:07] died so brothers and sisters I just want
[1:34:10] want to make that plain our sin requires
[1:34:14] death the separation from God really it
[1:34:19] requires
[1:34:21] hell the stakes are very very
[1:34:24] high if we
[1:34:27] sin and there is no atonement for sin
[1:34:31] through the blood of the Supreme
[1:34:33] sacrifice Jesus Christ we will go to
[1:34:37] hell I don't know how else to play to
[1:34:40] say it it's not me that's saying those
[1:34:42] things it's this Bible that says it
[1:34:46] that's how important Jesus
[1:34:49] is so back to the Sabbath in uh numbers
[1:34:54] chapter 15 so so Moses brings down the
[1:34:58] Ten Commandments okay and and one of
[1:35:01] those Commandments is honor the Sabbath
[1:35:03] day to keep it holy so he comes down and
[1:35:06] and he tells all the people and you'll
[1:35:08] be punished they'll be there'll be
[1:35:09] they'll be punishment for this so this
[1:35:11] man goes out on the
[1:35:15] Sabbath and I remember first time I read
[1:35:18] this I was like no way first time I
[1:35:20] remember reading it he goes out and he
[1:35:24] probably going to cook some dinner so he
[1:35:27] goes out and he gets a couple sticks and
[1:35:30] he picks them up and he's walking back
[1:35:33] and they're like
[1:35:35] hey that just broke the Sabbath you're
[1:35:38] not supposed to do that so he he was
[1:35:42] like
[1:35:43] oh yeah or maybe he was just
[1:35:45] disrespecting God we don't know but
[1:35:48] they're like well let's go see Moses and
[1:35:52] see what's the punishment is is so they
[1:35:54] take the man and they bring him to
[1:35:57] Moses and Moses is like yeah um let me
[1:36:01] ask
[1:36:02] God
[1:36:04] so he asked God God says that man must
[1:36:10] die take him outside the city and kill
[1:36:13] him when I read that I was
[1:36:17] like no
[1:36:19] way they killed him what about what
[1:36:23] about him him saying he's sorry or
[1:36:26] whatever this can't be right let me get
[1:36:28] another translation you
[1:36:31] know that was
[1:36:35] Justice God provided that Justice
[1:36:37] remember aen when he stole when they
[1:36:39] went over in the promised land they went
[1:36:41] over to Jericho and they they aen steals
[1:36:44] the wedge of gold and the Babylonian
[1:36:46] garment they took him outside not only
[1:36:48] did they kill aan they killed his whole
[1:36:51] family
[1:36:54] that is
[1:36:57] Justice Brothers and Sisters I Don't
[1:36:59] Want Justice I want
[1:37:05] Mercy you can see brother Lyall I can
[1:37:08] see why it's so important to the Jewish
[1:37:11] people that they have two separate pots
[1:37:14] one for cooking a goat and one for
[1:37:17] boiling milk and and they they don't
[1:37:19] even I was there and it was Saturday and
[1:37:22] the the elevator didn't
[1:37:24] work they're not allowed to press the
[1:37:28] button on Saturday but I understand I
[1:37:32] get it the stakes are really
[1:37:36] high that's why that they put those
[1:37:39] things in order they want to make sure
[1:37:41] that they are not breaking those
[1:37:44] Commandments but in they don't know
[1:37:48] Jesus yet they don't know how important
[1:37:51] that this Jesus Christ is they don't
[1:37:54] know that there is a rest that we find
[1:37:56] in Christ that if we do sin that there
[1:37:59] is an atonement for sin and I love him
[1:38:01] so much that I'm going to try not to
[1:38:04] there is a rest there I preached on on
[1:38:07] Mother's Day I believe it was I preached
[1:38:08] on El
[1:38:09] Shai that God that can nurse strength
[1:38:13] into that child there's something about
[1:38:17] the one that you really love the one
[1:38:19] that you really trust that you can
[1:38:20] really find rest in that person remember
[1:38:24] meline when she was a little girl she
[1:38:26] was she had a spoon and there was
[1:38:30] something plugged into the light socket
[1:38:32] and she goes over there brother Jordan
[1:38:35] This is the difference between a a dad
[1:38:36] and a
[1:38:37] mom and she takes the spoon and she
[1:38:40] starts to put it in behind the lights
[1:38:43] the the plug the light switch that was
[1:38:45] plugged in she starts putting it in
[1:38:47] there and I was like I think I know
[1:38:49] what's going to
[1:38:52] happen and and it
[1:38:54] did it
[1:38:57] boom it it arked and I'll tell you what
[1:39:00] the little girl she big pucker lip and
[1:39:03] she was scared and she ran to me she
[1:39:06] knew she had done something wrong but
[1:39:08] she ran to that
[1:39:10] safety and that's how we do with Christ
[1:39:13] there is rest a a baby I noticed when
[1:39:16] little Laurel when when when she when
[1:39:19] she gets upset she wants mom she wants
[1:39:22] Dad she wants the ones that that she
[1:39:25] knows the best that she trusts the
[1:39:28] most and that's how it is how we can
[1:39:30] have rest in Jesus we want to go to the
[1:39:33] one that knows me the best the one that
[1:39:35] I can really
[1:39:38] trust so this sabbath
[1:39:41] day it was only a type of the real
[1:39:46] thing that's why the seventh day
[1:39:48] adventti they don't get it the Sabbath
[1:39:50] should be honored more today than it as
[1:39:53] ever been but it's not one day of the
[1:39:56] week we can rest in Christ 24 hours
[1:40:01] every single day knowing that Jesus
[1:40:03] Christ has forgiven me for my sins and
[1:40:05] there's no fighting like they did when
[1:40:08] they crossed over Jordan remember they
[1:40:09] went in the promised land and he says
[1:40:11] I'm not God says I'm not going to give
[1:40:13] them rest remember when when the spies
[1:40:15] came back he says they will not they are
[1:40:17] all going to die and I'm going to raise
[1:40:19] up a new generation and they'll go
[1:40:21] over but when they went over there was
[1:40:24] no rest first thing they do is get in a
[1:40:26] big fight at
[1:40:28] Jericho and kill a bunch of people and
[1:40:30] the walls come coming down then they
[1:40:32] then they go to Ai and they
[1:40:34] lose it wasn't rest that didn't fulfill
[1:40:38] it let's keep on going in the
[1:40:41] scriptures
[1:40:48] um with like I said with the Sabbath
[1:40:52] it's it is a type of something
[1:40:56] and it's
[1:40:59] like like communion we take the
[1:41:02] communion with understanding that that
[1:41:05] piece of bread is not the literal Body
[1:41:07] of Christ and that wine is not his
[1:41:09] literal blood but we are doing this in
[1:41:12] remembrance as a
[1:41:14] symbol We are following a commandment
[1:41:17] but we're doing as a symbol that one day
[1:41:19] we will eat with that man that died for
[1:41:23] our sins we will eat with him and when
[1:41:26] we go and when we eat communion is not a
[1:41:28] meal it's just a little piece of bread
[1:41:31] tiny and a little thing of wine but when
[1:41:35] we go it represents when we go to be
[1:41:38] with him that now they will we will have
[1:41:41] that communion with him it's
[1:41:43] representative same with the Sabbath
[1:41:45] it's representative of someone something
[1:41:47] else we honor it we obey it but it
[1:41:50] represents something else and there
[1:41:52] there are people that claim to be
[1:41:53] Christians they claim the name of of
[1:41:56] Jesus Christ but they don't honor what
[1:42:00] he
[1:42:01] said I uh I'm running out of time I'll
[1:42:03] tell you what I'll finish tonight I want
[1:42:04] to get to I want to get to this when
[1:42:08] Jesus said I believe it's in Matthew
[1:42:10] chapter 7 he said many will come to
[1:42:14] me in my
[1:42:16] name and say have we not cast out Devils
[1:42:20] have we not healed the sick have we not
[1:42:23] done Mighty works in your name in the
[1:42:27] name of
[1:42:29] Jesus and he's going and he's going to
[1:42:31] say depart from me you that work
[1:42:34] iniquity for I never knew you I didn't
[1:42:38] know who you were you've done these
[1:42:40] things you went through the the Motions
[1:42:42] but you didn't know me and I didn't know
[1:42:45] you so these people are banished to Hell
[1:42:48] who are these people they're not Muslim
[1:42:50] Muslims don't come in the name of Jesus
[1:42:51] Christ they're not Hindus Hindus doesn't
[1:42:54] come in the name of Jesus Christ they're
[1:42:56] not the drug addicts on the street
[1:42:57] they're not coming in the name of Jesus
[1:42:59] Christ who comes in the name of Jesus
[1:43:01] Christ claims his name but they're not
[1:43:06] real they don't take it seriously enough
[1:43:10] how
[1:43:10] important is it this hits right at home
[1:43:15] brothers and sisters we cannot if we if
[1:43:17] we are sinning will willfully if we're
[1:43:20] doing these
[1:43:21] things is it going to be us that says oh
[1:43:24] one time I had an experience at the
[1:43:26] altar he'll probably say if you had the
[1:43:28] experience of the altar then you should
[1:43:29] have known
[1:43:31] better than to fall back into that
[1:43:34] sin book of Hebrews is warning don't go
[1:43:39] back to
[1:43:40] that and he's trying to tell them do you
[1:43:43] see how important this is that if you
[1:43:45] really accept it you know the Sabbath
[1:43:47] Hebrews you know that the Commandment if
[1:43:50] you really understood the Sabbath you
[1:43:53] would see that it only typed it was a
[1:43:56] representation of this man when he came
[1:43:59] that you can find rest like a child can
[1:44:01] find rest in its mother's
[1:44:05] arms and if we find that rest everything
[1:44:08] will always be all
[1:44:13] right and the author is trying to get
[1:44:15] people back to the seriousness of
[1:44:18] Christ and then he says in verse 5 he
[1:44:22] says and in this place again if they
[1:44:24] shall enter into my rest and he quotes
[1:44:27] again Psalm
[1:44:29] 995 saying seeing therefore it remaineth
[1:44:32] that some must enter therein and they to
[1:44:35] whom it was first preached entered not
[1:44:38] in because of
[1:44:43] unbelief Let's uh the musicians would
[1:44:46] would come and um I'm out of time so
[1:44:50] we'll uh I'll I'll pick it up tonight
[1:44:53] brothers and sisters this book of
[1:44:57] Hebrews he is saying look here he is in
[1:45:00] history all of these things are a
[1:45:03] type of now this man Jesus Christ and
[1:45:08] don't neglect
[1:45:10] it you will find yourself being judged
[1:45:14] one
[1:45:15] day you'll find
[1:45:17] yourself with that righteous
[1:45:21] judge and and where will mercy
[1:45:24] be that we didn't try to serve him and
[1:45:28] he's warning the Hebrews listen you know
[1:45:30] the scriptures you know the prophets you
[1:45:34] know what they said you have a good
[1:45:36] understanding but please don't neglect
[1:45:39] these things study this and he's taking
[1:45:42] the scriptures and he's bringing them
[1:45:44] out so that the people will understand
[1:45:48] do we
[1:45:49] understand do we understand that just
[1:45:51] because we call ourselves
[1:45:54] Believers just because we call ourselves
[1:45:57] Christians just because that we say that
[1:46:01] that we understand this or or we might
[1:46:03] read our Bibles there has to be that
[1:46:06] personal experience that personal
[1:46:08] relationship if you look at the Old
[1:46:10] Testament and the New Testament there's
[1:46:12] one really big
[1:46:15] difference and we'll close with this
[1:46:18] that big difference in the Old Testament
[1:46:21] is God dealt with with the entire
[1:46:25] country when achen stole the wedge of
[1:46:28] gold he and his family were put to death
[1:46:31] and all of Israel suffered for
[1:46:33] it but now in the New Testament it's no
[1:46:38] longer dealing with an entire country
[1:46:41] now it is dealing with an
[1:46:43] individual with one person with Daniel
[1:46:48] Evans with me with you and him that's a
[1:46:52] big that's a huge difference between the
[1:46:54] old and the new now we can know Jesus
[1:46:57] Christ ourselves now the high priest we
[1:46:59] don't have to go to the priest and give
[1:47:01] him a lamb to sacrifice to sacrifice we
[1:47:05] can go straight to God through the
[1:47:08] atonement of Jesus Christ that's what
[1:47:10] it's all about that's a big difference
[1:47:12] between the old and the new and imagine
[1:47:14] the rest that we know whatever happens
[1:47:18] imagine how we can have comfort knowing
[1:47:20] that Jesus Christ is on the throne and
[1:47:22] that he knows my name that he knows me
[1:47:26] he knows my
[1:47:27] family imagine how we can just un how we
[1:47:30] can just rest in that and we talk about
[1:47:34] the
[1:47:34] Sabbath it was just a
[1:47:40] little hint of what we have now that we
[1:47:44] can rest in Jesus Christ if we know him
[1:47:48] and if we put him first in our lives
[1:47:51] amen brother
[1:47:58] just I was
[1:48:03] Str in sin's dark
[1:48:08] Valley no hope
[1:48:11] within

[1:51:39] me the
[1:51:41] rest the rest of Jesus
[1:51:44] Christ there is something there is just
[1:51:47] something so special to know that
[1:51:50] whatever happens
[1:51:53] that Jesus is there and that is what the
[1:51:56] Sabbath
[1:51:59] represented it wasn't just a day to take
[1:52:02] off and to relax the Sabbath was
[1:52:06] representative of something that is to
[1:52:09] come and what was it what was to come is
[1:52:14] now that is Jesus the blood of Jesus
[1:52:17] Christ has cleansed me from my sins
[1:52:23] this book of Hebrews was written to
[1:52:27] remind those people that had already
[1:52:30] accepted Christ of the gravity of the
[1:52:34] situation and he was bringing him up out
[1:52:36] of the Old Testament and showing that
[1:52:38] listen that he is the Fulfillment of
[1:52:45] everything and brothers and sisters he
[1:52:47] is alive
[1:52:49] today he's everything
[1:52:53] the book of Hebrews to
[1:52:55] me it is an absolute
[1:53:00] Masterpiece a literary
[1:53:03] Masterpiece quote after quote after
[1:53:06] quote from the Old Testament and lifting
[1:53:08] him up just wait till we get into
[1:53:10] MDC and the spiritualness of that man
[1:53:14] that met
[1:53:17] Abraham it was Jesus the author
[1:53:20] says Jesus over a thousand years
[1:53:24] earlier in the form of a
[1:53:27] man and Abraham recognized him and paid
[1:53:30] ties to
[1:53:31] him tremendous tremendous and and the
[1:53:35] high priest and how that Jesus that even
[1:53:38] the high priest going into the holy of
[1:53:39] holies it wasn't it represented
[1:53:42] something
[1:53:43] else and when Jesus came and made that
[1:53:47] atonement there was a curtain that
[1:53:51] covered the holy of holies that back
[1:53:55] room and only the high priest could go
[1:53:58] in there once a
[1:53:59] year and when Jesus Christ died on the
[1:54:04] cross that curtain was ripped from top
[1:54:08] to bottom
[1:54:12] exposing that Mercy Seat that holy of
[1:54:16] holies representative of what Jesus did
[1:54:19] he was
[1:54:20] torn so that we might be able to talk to
[1:54:25] God and brothers and sisters it is the
[1:54:27] most important thing to remember that
[1:54:29] this new testament it speaks of a
[1:54:32] personal relationship a personal walk
[1:54:35] with God you have to talk to
[1:54:39] him and if we as in the ministry if we
[1:54:42] can just open this book like the book of
[1:54:44] Hebrews does and show that here he is
[1:54:47] now you have to have that relationship
[1:54:50] with him it can't be from Washington
[1:54:52] pots and and making sacrifices it has to
[1:54:55] be that relationship if we can just show
[1:55:00] that but there's going to be those that
[1:55:03] come in the name of Jesus
[1:55:07] Christ and he's going to say depart from
[1:55:09] me you that work iniquity I never knew
[1:55:12] you because they just say they're
[1:55:15] Christians they just give him they just
[1:55:18] give him lip
[1:55:19] service but oh when you have something
[1:55:22] that hurts when you have something that
[1:55:25] that you need you need that rest he is
[1:55:29] alive and he works miracles he does
[1:55:33] things and if we could just know him if
[1:55:35] you're sick you're you you'll get healed
[1:55:38] but you'll get sick again but there is
[1:55:39] an eternal
[1:55:41] reward and to
[1:55:43] me that Eternal reward is I get to be
[1:55:45] with him that's what I want with all of
[1:55:48] my heart I want to be with Jesus do you
[1:55:50] want to be with him that's all
[1:55:52] [Music]

[1:57:46] things he has done let's bow our heads
[1:57:56] God is a just God and he requires
[1:58:01] justice but there was
[1:58:04] also a sacrifice that was without spot
[1:58:08] or blemish that stood in my place so
[1:58:11] that I might receive eternal life so
[1:58:14] that my sins might be
[1:58:17] forgiven
