[41:20] my words will fail you know that what
[41:22] brother lyle says is suspect
[41:25] it's guaranteed that my words will fail
[41:27] but his words can't and that's what we
[41:30] depend on so while we're standing and
[41:32] before we read from the scriptures let's
[41:34] approach the lord together
[41:36] lord jesus
[41:37] it's such a privilege to be here among
[41:39] the blood-washed and blood-bought
[41:42] purchase
[41:44] lord jesus your children lord as we
[41:47] heard this morning lord as as each seed
[41:49] brings forth of its own kind lord jesus
[41:52] we pray that you would help us this
[41:54] evening lord i pray that you'd help lyle
[41:56] johnson to just disappear into the
[41:57] background somewhere and just become a
[41:59] channel that you could speak to our
[42:01] hearts that you could answer questions
[42:02] that you could meet needs lord jesus
[42:04] that's why we're here to meet with you
[42:06] to receive from you and to offer you our
[42:08] worship and our praise we commit this
[42:10] evening in this service in this time
[42:12] that we share together into your hands
[42:14] lord if i misspeak something lord please
[42:16] help those that are listening to hear
[42:19] the intent lord to hear from you we
[42:22] thank you
[42:23] in jesus precious name
[42:29] nephesh that's an unusual word we'll
[42:32] we'll get to that uh i'm going to ask
[42:34] you to remain standing for just a couple
[42:36] of minutes i want to give you a little
[42:37] bit of context
[42:38] for
[42:39] the opening verses that we're going to
[42:41] have
[42:42] it will be from john's gospel account
[42:44] but the context of the reading is that
[42:46] it's the spring of the year
[42:48] passover is approaching it's early in
[42:51] jesus ministry i think jesus said just a
[42:54] day or two before
[42:55] performed a miracle
[42:57] feeding thousands of people from a small
[43:00] lunch basket
[43:02] and
[43:02] he tells us at the beginning of this
[43:04] chapter that these folks were seeking
[43:06] them out because while they hadn't
[43:08] expected a free meal they'd sure like to
[43:10] get more of them
[43:11] so jesus engages in a kind of a lengthy
[43:14] discussion with some of them and we have
[43:16] his discourse on the bread of life as a
[43:18] result
[43:20] but he concludes
[43:21] with some shocking statements
[43:24] so we'll read
[43:27] if i turn this on
[43:30] we'll read from the gospel of john
[43:32] chapter 6 beginning at verse 53
[43:35] then jesus said unto them verily verily
[43:38] i say unto you now we know jesus is the
[43:40] only one that can say that other
[43:41] prophets that were just prophets would
[43:44] say thus saith the lord the lord has
[43:46] said but jesus said i say
[43:49] it's the same thing when you know who
[43:51] jesus is
[43:52] he says except you eat the flesh of the
[43:54] son of man he's talking about himself
[43:57] and drink his blood
[43:59] you have no life in you
[44:01] you're the walking dead
[44:04] who so eats my flesh
[44:06] and drinks my blood
[44:09] has eternal life
[44:11] and i'll raise him up at the last day
[44:14] for my flesh
[44:16] his meat is food indeed and my blood is
[44:19] drink indeed
[44:21] he that eats my flesh and drinks my
[44:23] blood dwells that is he lives and me and
[44:26] i live in him
[44:29] as the living father has sent me
[44:32] and i live by the father so he that eats
[44:34] me he shall live by me
[44:37] this is that bread which came down from
[44:39] heaven not as your fathers did eat manna
[44:43] and are dead
[44:44] he that eateth this bread shall live
[44:46] forever
[44:48] lord help us to partake of that bread
[44:51] these things said he in the synagogue as
[44:54] he taught in kefarnachum
[44:58] many therefore of his disciples
[45:00] students
[45:01] apprentices followers when they had
[45:04] heard this
[45:05] said
[45:06] that's a hard saying
[45:08] who can hear it in the niv that verse
[45:11] says on hearing it
[45:13] many of his disciples said this is a
[45:15] hard teaching
[45:17] who can accept it
[45:19] and jumping to verse 66 we read from
[45:21] that time
[45:22] many of his disciples went back and
[45:25] walked no more with him
[45:27] i couldn't understand this they'd had
[45:28] enough please be seated
[45:32] these words of jesus were certainly hard
[45:34] for his audience to accept
[45:38] and easy to misunderstand
[45:41] throughout the 1980s and 1990s i i
[45:45] traveled around the planet quite a lot
[45:48] one of the places i went to off the
[45:49] coast of australia here was the nation
[45:51] of papua new guinea and i spent
[45:55] oops
[45:57] you can go ahead and zoom back brother i
[45:58] spent a couple of months
[46:00] on this island here the island of
[46:02] bougainville yeah bougainvilleas grow in
[46:04] bougainville
[46:05] it's the same word one of the people
[46:07] that i worked with
[46:09] on this island was a fellow named blue
[46:13] he came from the big island the big
[46:15] island of papua new guinea about half
[46:17] the languages of the entire planet are
[46:19] spoken on that island it's all sorts of
[46:21] very isolated little villages anyway
[46:23] blue came from there and he was over
[46:25] here working in this mine and he
[46:28] happened to mention that in in this
[46:30] place that he lived that village that
[46:33] they were cannibalistic they ate their
[46:36] enemies
[46:37] and i kind of looked at him and he
[46:39] looked at me
[46:41] tasty
[46:42] so if jesus had been talking
[46:45] to people in blues village
[46:48] they would have said hey we're going to
[46:50] have a barbecue
[46:51] right they would have just been quite
[46:54] quite happy because they would have
[46:55] accepted it at the surface level of what
[46:57] he appeared to be saying instead of what
[46:58] he was actually saying
[47:01] but the jewish inhabitants of judea and
[47:04] galilee and jesus day
[47:07] not so much
[47:09] a very different culture
[47:11] a completely different societal context
[47:15] consider the background and teaching
[47:17] of jesus audience
[47:20] first they were taught that all life
[47:22] came from god we read in genesis the
[47:24] first chapter
[47:26] the fifth day of creation god said let
[47:28] the earth bring forth the living
[47:30] creature after his kind
[47:33] cattle
[47:34] and creeping thing
[47:36] and beast of the earth after his kind
[47:39] and it was so
[47:41] second
[47:43] in genesis 2 we're taught that humans
[47:46] are distinct
[47:48] from other animal life the lord god
[47:50] formed man of the dust of the ground
[47:53] and breathed into his nostrils the
[47:55] breath of life
[47:57] and man
[47:59] became a living soul
[48:00] we'll get back to this shortly
[48:03] the third thing that they were taught in
[48:05] their background
[48:06] was that blood's not on the menu
[48:09] we read what he told noah after the
[48:11] flood in genesis 9 noah is told every
[48:15] moving thing that liveth
[48:17] shall be meat for you
[48:19] even as the green herb i have given you
[48:21] all things in other words you don't have
[48:22] to be a vegetarian anymore you can go
[48:24] ahead and eat other stuff
[48:26] but flesh
[48:28] with the life thereof
[48:30] which is the blood thereof
[48:33] don't eat that
[48:35] this was well before the call of abraham
[48:38] many centuries later god commanded
[48:41] through moses we read in leviticus 7
[48:43] moreover you shall eat no manner of
[48:46] blood whether it be a fowl
[48:48] or a beast
[48:50] and any of your dwellings and that
[48:52] doesn't mean it's okay to go to a
[48:53] restaurant and eat it
[48:55] after all this time
[48:57] god was consistent
[48:59] in his insistence
[49:01] on this point
[49:03] and look at the dire punishment
[49:06] if this command's violated whatsoever
[49:09] soul it be that eateth any manner of
[49:12] blood
[49:13] even that soul shall be cut off from his
[49:15] people
[49:18] you may recall from the acts of the
[49:19] council in jerusalem when considering
[49:21] the question of whether gentiles had to
[49:23] become practitioners of judaism
[49:27] the conclusion was that they didn't but
[49:30] one of the very few commands they were
[49:32] given a list of four things
[49:34] was from this covenant with noah we read
[49:36] in acts 15 verse 28 and 29 it seemed
[49:39] good to the holy ghost this is the
[49:41] letter that was written and paul and
[49:42] others were then delivering back to the
[49:44] gentile believers it seemed good to the
[49:46] holy ghost who's that
[49:48] and to us to lay upon you no greater
[49:51] burden than these necessary things
[49:54] that she abstained from meats offered to
[49:56] idols and from blood
[49:59] and from things strangled
[50:01] and from fornication from which if you
[50:04] keep yourselves you shall do well
[50:07] fair you will
[50:10] so if this is your cultural and
[50:12] religious background you're not from
[50:14] blues village in new guinea
[50:16] how would you have reacted
[50:18] if you heard jesus making a statement
[50:21] like this
[50:23] verily verily i say to you except you
[50:26] eat
[50:27] my flesh and drink my blood you're dead
[50:30] you have no life in you
[50:35] on the surface
[50:36] this seems at best
[50:38] mysterious and at worst
[50:41] contradictory to god's very consistent
[50:43] instructions
[50:45] now the catholic church teaches that at
[50:47] mass the communion wafer and the wine
[50:49] are literally transformed into jesus
[50:52] flesh and blood when partaken by the
[50:54] faithful
[50:55] it's called the doctrine of
[50:57] transubstantiation
[50:59] i attended the lutheran church from age
[51:01] 14 to 16.
[51:03] in the confirmation class there i was
[51:05] taught the same doctrine
[51:08] just because they're teaching it doesn't
[51:10] mean i received it i remember arguing
[51:12] with some staunch lutheran people that
[51:14] this is nonsense
[51:16] i was soundly rebuked for my unbelief
[51:19] i wasn't too good of a lutheran i guess
[51:22] well what's what's going on here
[51:26] several weeks ago heather and i traveled
[51:29] to dallas
[51:30] dallas texas to be with the family of
[51:32] brother alan hokinson
[51:35] brother al attended tucson tabernacle in
[51:37] the 1960s and 70s he'd suddenly passed
[51:40] away he was 94 years old
[51:43] and we were there
[51:44] for the family and for the funeral
[51:47] now alan was part of our group living in
[51:49] israel back in the mid 70s and
[51:52] some of his family are jewish
[51:54] and practice judaism
[51:56] a person that dropped by to pay his
[51:58] respects to the family that weekend knew
[52:00] nothing of judaism
[52:02] he was surprised to find that
[52:04] slaughtering an animal for kosher meat
[52:06] involved draining the blood from the
[52:08] animal
[52:10] one never eats bloody meat much less
[52:12] blood itself like black sausage or
[52:14] something
[52:15] he asked
[52:16] why and the person responding for whom
[52:20] hebrew is her native tongue
[52:22] explained that eating the blood would
[52:24] mean taking on and absorbing in some way
[52:28] the nature of the animal
[52:32] she used the hebrew word
[52:34] nephesh
[52:36] and was searching for the english word i
[52:38] i offered the life is in the blood and
[52:40] she said yeah
[52:43] maybe
[52:44] it was clear she wasn't quite satisfied
[52:46] with that translation
[52:48] it was incomplete
[52:50] well later that evening i reflected on
[52:52] that conversation and recalled the word
[52:54] nephesh being tied in with the story of
[52:56] noah's ark and so forth
[52:59] and
[53:01] something clicked
[53:04] it became even clearer to me
[53:06] why we talk about the blood of jesus
[53:08] why he said you must eat my body
[53:11] and drink my blood
[53:14] and i want to share that with you
[53:15] tonight
[53:17] let's consider this hebrew word
[53:20] nephesh
[53:21] now this isn't intended to be a word
[53:23] study and it's not intended to be an
[53:25] intellectual exercise but rather a
[53:27] belief exploration exploration of the
[53:30] culture
[53:31] reflected in this biblical hebrew word
[53:33] and how it relates to us
[53:35] as christians
[53:38] we know that this is a sunday school
[53:40] lesson right we know that language
[53:42] reflects and helps shape and perpetuate
[53:45] various human cultures
[53:47] that's why there isn't a simple word for
[53:49] word translation that allows for an
[53:51] accurate exchange of ideas across
[53:53] languages
[53:55] even word order grammar varies even
[53:58] between languages of similar culture in
[54:00] english i might say oh the mountain's
[54:02] tall
[54:04] if i were a french person and it would
[54:06] translate it back to english i might say
[54:08] tall the mountain is
[54:11] in hebrew transliteration one might say
[54:13] the mountain the big
[54:16] it's not a one for one mapping
[54:19] finally most words have multiple
[54:21] definitions
[54:22] causing us to rely on the context to
[54:25] understand the intent or the meaning
[54:28] word meanings change over time if you
[54:30] read the king james bible and have a
[54:32] conversation with your friend
[54:34] we're told they're both english
[54:36] right
[54:38] if you've ever seen the book the the
[54:39] emphatic diaglot
[54:41] which is a transliteration of greek and
[54:45] english for the new testament
[54:47] it's
[54:49] strange to read some of that because the
[54:51] the grammar is just so different and the
[54:53] language is primitive right
[54:57] well
[54:59] the first meaning that we run across for
[55:01] nephesh as you might expect is in the
[55:03] first chapter of genesis
[55:07] and for those of you that pay attention
[55:09] to this sort of stuff this is strong's
[55:11] hebrew word 53 15. don't don't get too
[55:14] deep into strong stuff because it's a
[55:16] dictionary just keep in mind it's not a
[55:20] commentary it's a dictionary okay
[55:22] nephesh
[55:25] a creature
[55:26] one which has breath that's translated
[55:29] into english's creature in genesis 1 24
[55:32] god said let the earth bring forth the
[55:35] living creature
[55:37] bring forth the living nephesh after his
[55:40] kind cattle and creeping thing and beast
[55:42] of the earth after his kind and it was
[55:44] so i've highlighted in yellow
[55:47] where the hebrew word is translated into
[55:49] english
[55:50] to illustrate some of these meanings of
[55:52] nephesh this will all come together in a
[55:54] little bit so don't fall asleep on me if
[55:56] you do don't snore
[56:00] a second meaning is sometimes translated
[56:04] life like the life is in the blood in
[56:06] genesis 9 4 but flesh with the life the
[56:09] nephesh thereof which is the blood
[56:12] thereof there's a linkage being
[56:14] established
[56:15] you shall not eat
[56:18] now it's not about platelets it's not
[56:20] about hemoglobin it's not about bone
[56:23] marrow advanced physiology
[56:25] the most common hebrew word translated
[56:28] is life is the word caim
[56:30] but here we see there's another
[56:32] dimension because god's not just talking
[56:34] about life but he's linking it with
[56:36] something else he's linking it with the
[56:38] blood to life the word nephesh is never
[56:42] translated as blood but there's this
[56:45] linkage
[56:55] understand that we understand that the
[56:58] first five books the pentateuch the the
[57:00] torah uh genesis exodus leviticus number
[57:03] deuteronomy written by moses jesus told
[57:05] us that
[57:06] and as we've looked into recent
[57:08] archaeological discoveries we found that
[57:11] in fact the technology and an alphabet
[57:14] actually existed just in time
[57:16] for moses to have actually done that but
[57:20] therefore
[57:21] the illustrations the words that are
[57:23] being used are a reflection of the
[57:25] culture
[57:26] and the time
[57:28] of the exodus
[57:30] well let's look at another meaning
[57:33] which helps establish this linkage of
[57:35] blood and life and this nephesh we'll go
[57:38] back to the creation narratives and
[57:40] again back to genesis 2.
[57:43] it's translated as soul as in man became
[57:46] a living soul
[57:49] genesis 2 7 the lord god formed man of
[57:52] the dust of the ground this is the body
[57:54] of adam right
[57:55] and breathed into his nostrils
[57:58] the breath of life
[58:01] and man became a living soul a living
[58:05] nephesh
[58:06] so here we see a created being which has
[58:09] breath but unlike previous creatures
[58:12] man's breath came directly from god
[58:15] you can imagine cpr or resuscitation
[58:23] right
[58:24] and what happens
[58:28] this isn't just a blast of atmospheric
[58:31] wind
[58:32] keep in mind the connection between life
[58:35] soul breath
[58:36] wind they'll all connect together soon
[58:40] thinking about the word soul
[58:43] here's something brother branham said
[58:45] and you must be born again from 1961 if
[58:48] you're born of god this is your father
[58:50] he's the word the word no matter how
[58:52] many sensations you have
[58:55] still a child of satan until you become
[58:57] dead to the world and alive in christ
[58:59] listen quickly and i was sold good or
[59:01] bad death doesn't change it i
[59:04] had a lot of scripture wrote down here
[59:06] on this one i wanted to comment on what
[59:08] a soul is
[59:10] what is a soul
[59:12] it's you
[59:13] you're a soul the part inside of you
[59:15] when you die whatever shape that soul is
[59:17] in that's the way it goes it goes to its
[59:20] destination you couldn't pull it up no
[59:21] matter how much you do for it that's so
[59:23] got to be changed here got to be born
[59:26] again
[59:27] i say what about the holy ghost brother
[59:28] branham the holy ghost baptizes you into
[59:31] the body for service but you believe
[59:34] unto eternal life he that heareth my
[59:36] words and believe without him that sent
[59:38] me has eternal life see
[59:40] then you're baptized by the holy spirit
[59:42] into the body for manifestations of the
[59:44] gifts and so forth but you believe to
[59:47] eternal life he that believeth has
[59:49] eternal life when you believe it's when
[59:52] you're dead and are born regenerated a
[59:55] new creature
[59:56] all right
[59:58] so we recognize
[1:00:00] that our physical body is that of a
[1:00:02] mammal a kind of an animal right but our
[1:00:05] true self our inner man
[1:00:07] our soul is unique among all other
[1:00:10] earthly creatures
[1:00:13] well how's that you might ask what made
[1:00:16] adam so different
[1:00:18] i'm glad you asked that
[1:00:20] let's go back to genesis 2.
[1:00:23] the lord god formed man of the dust of
[1:00:25] the ground and breathed into his
[1:00:27] nostrils the breath of life and man
[1:00:28] became a living soul
[1:00:31] it was only to adam
[1:00:33] while eve was still part of him
[1:00:37] that god breathed the breath of life
[1:00:41] other creatures as we read in genesis 1
[1:00:43] 24 had life breath but that's just air
[1:00:46] oxygen and biological biochemistry
[1:00:48] processes
[1:00:50] only with adam
[1:00:52] did god directly intervene in this way
[1:00:57] if we go back to god's covenant with
[1:00:58] noah we see how serious god placed the
[1:01:01] linkage of blood and god breathed soul
[1:01:03] life this nephesh
[1:01:05] genesis 9
[1:01:07] surely your blood of your lives nephesh
[1:01:10] will i require at the hand of every
[1:01:12] beast i will acquire it at the hand of
[1:01:14] man at the hand of every man's brother i
[1:01:16] will require the life of man who so
[1:01:19] sheddeth man's blood by man shall his
[1:01:21] blood be shed for in the image of god
[1:01:23] made he man
[1:01:26] the niv might be a little clearer let me
[1:01:28] read it from the niv
[1:01:30] and for your life flood i will surely
[1:01:33] demand an accounting
[1:01:34] i will demand an accounting from every
[1:01:36] animal and from each human being to i'll
[1:01:38] demand an accounting for the life of
[1:01:40] another human being
[1:01:43] who ever sheds human blood by humans
[1:01:46] shall their blood be shed for in the
[1:01:48] image of god
[1:01:49] has god made mankind and again
[1:01:52] we're talking about
[1:01:54] the spiritual in other words if a man or
[1:01:56] an animal kills a human that man or
[1:01:58] animal must be put to death we know our
[1:02:00] physical body is not in the image of god
[1:02:02] it's our soul our spirit man which is
[1:02:05] again no other creature has this
[1:02:08] distinction none
[1:02:10] god's not talking about biology
[1:02:13] that's why it's okay to kill and eat an
[1:02:15] animal that has life breath
[1:02:18] but not god breath
[1:02:21] as i mentioned earlier other hebrew
[1:02:22] words are translated as life the most
[1:02:24] common being haim just because the word
[1:02:27] life appears in your english bible or
[1:02:30] veda in your spanish bible it doesn't
[1:02:32] necessarily mean it was nephesh in the
[1:02:34] hebrew text
[1:02:37] it was god's breath imparted to adam
[1:02:40] that brought this breath of nephesh life
[1:02:45] where else do we see this sort of thing
[1:02:47] is it only in genesis
[1:02:50] let's
[1:02:51] jump to the end of john's gospel
[1:02:54] it's
[1:02:55] after jesus resurrection that same day
[1:02:59] that
[1:03:00] evening the most important day i think
[1:03:03] that ever happened the resurrection the
[1:03:05] proof
[1:03:07] being the first day of the week when the
[1:03:08] doors were shut where the disciples were
[1:03:10] assembled for fear of the jews
[1:03:13] came jesus and stood in the midst
[1:03:16] and jesus said unto them
[1:03:18] peace be unto you
[1:03:21] shalom
[1:03:23] and when jesus had so said he showed
[1:03:25] unto them his hands and his side
[1:03:29] then were the disciples glad when they
[1:03:31] saw the lord and jesus said to them
[1:03:33] again
[1:03:35] shalom peace
[1:03:37] be unto you
[1:03:38] as my father has sent me
[1:03:41] so
[1:03:43] i'm sending you
[1:03:45] and when he had said this
[1:03:47] jesus breathed
[1:03:50] on them
[1:03:52] and said to them receive ye
[1:03:55] the holy ghost
[1:03:58] did they receive the holy spirit then
[1:04:01] or was that a promise yet to be
[1:04:03] fulfilled
[1:04:05] jesus didn't breathe into them
[1:04:07] he wasn't performing cpr
[1:04:09] but his breath god's breath
[1:04:12] is intimately associated with the holy
[1:04:15] spirit as we'll see in a moment in fact
[1:04:17] let's let's see it now let's go to acts
[1:04:19] chapter one
[1:04:21] starting at verse four and being
[1:04:23] assembled together with him jesus
[1:04:26] commanded the disciples that they should
[1:04:28] not depart from jerusalem but wait for
[1:04:30] the promise of the father
[1:04:32] which saith thee you have heard of me
[1:04:36] for john truly baptized with water but
[1:04:40] you shall be baptized with the holy
[1:04:42] ghost not sprinkled if you're at all
[1:04:44] familiar with judaism and the ritual
[1:04:46] bath the mikvah if you're not asked by
[1:04:49] brethren old he cleaned mikvahs for a
[1:04:51] while when we lived in israel
[1:04:53] a mikvah experience is a total immersion
[1:04:57] you shall be baptized with the holy
[1:04:59] ghost you'll be immersed in the holy
[1:05:01] spirit not many days hence
[1:05:05] when they were therefore come together
[1:05:07] the disciples asked of him saying lord
[1:05:09] will thou at this time restore again the
[1:05:10] kingdom to israel is it now is it now oh
[1:05:13] can't wait
[1:05:15] what did jesus say no it's not for you
[1:05:18] to know the times or even the
[1:05:20] seasons which the father hath put in his
[1:05:24] own power
[1:05:26] but they said don't worry about that
[1:05:28] don't concern yourselves with it instead
[1:05:30] of fretting over that he said you shall
[1:05:33] receive power
[1:05:35] after that the holy ghost has come upon
[1:05:37] you
[1:05:38] and you should be witnesses unto me
[1:05:41] in jerusalem judea samaria to the
[1:05:44] uttermost part of the earth and when
[1:05:46] jesus had spoken these things while they
[1:05:49] beheld
[1:05:50] he was taken up
[1:05:52] the cloud received him out of their
[1:05:54] sight
[1:05:55] so it's clear
[1:05:57] when he was with the disciples and
[1:06:00] breathed on them
[1:06:02] and told them to receive the holy spirit
[1:06:04] it was a promise to be fulfilled at a
[1:06:06] later time at his ascension
[1:06:08] it was still in the future
[1:06:11] consider if if i offer you a gift i'm
[1:06:14] not really going to give you this but if
[1:06:15] i offer you a gift that's not enough
[1:06:20] that's not enough
[1:06:21] right
[1:06:23] it's not a gift
[1:06:25] if i offer it to you
[1:06:28] unless you reach out and receive it
[1:06:31] then it's a gift it takes two there's
[1:06:33] two parts to this it's not well god will
[1:06:35] give me the holy ghost you have to want
[1:06:37] to receive it
[1:06:40] you have to reach out and grab a hold of
[1:06:42] it no matter how much he wants to give
[1:06:43] it to you it's a two-part thing when god
[1:06:46] breathed into adam's nostrils adam had
[1:06:49] to
[1:06:50] eventually inhale that breath
[1:06:53] it's two parts
[1:06:57] it's cooperative
[1:06:59] well did did they have to wait long
[1:07:02] let's go to the next chapter of acts and
[1:07:05] when the day of pentecost was fully come
[1:07:08] we talked about this earlier this year
[1:07:10] the disciples that many more than just
[1:07:13] the 12 we know that we're all with one
[1:07:15] accord
[1:07:16] in one place
[1:07:18] is that us tonight
[1:07:20] we're in one place
[1:07:22] are we all truly
[1:07:24] in one accord
[1:07:26] well what happened when they were in one
[1:07:28] place and one accord
[1:07:30] suddenly there came a sound
[1:07:33] from heaven
[1:07:34] as of a mushy rushing mighty wind
[1:07:38] they became wind blown trees brother
[1:07:40] peter and it filled all the house where
[1:07:43] they were sitting
[1:07:50] the new testament was written in greek
[1:07:51] and aramaic not hebrew
[1:07:54] but this particular word for wind the
[1:07:56] greek word is nue it's uh strong's g4157
[1:08:01] for those of you that are interested
[1:08:04] that's it's derivation it's root is a
[1:08:06] respiration a breeze breath or wind but
[1:08:08] it's linked to hebrew words linked back
[1:08:11] to the septuagint which is the greek
[1:08:13] translation of the old testament and
[1:08:14] then back to the hebrew that it was
[1:08:16] translated from and it's tied to
[1:08:19] nephesh
[1:08:20] the word we've been talking about it's
[1:08:22] tied to a couple of other words
[1:08:25] neshama that's the breath of god that
[1:08:27] adam received
[1:08:29] it also means divine inspiration
[1:08:32] scripture is
[1:08:34] neshama inspired by god divine
[1:08:37] inspiration god breathed is how the niv
[1:08:40] talks about the scripture
[1:08:41] and it's also the hebrew word ruach
[1:08:43] which is just atmospheric wind just just
[1:08:47] wind
[1:08:49] so we understand just from this one word
[1:08:51] we can understand there was a sound of
[1:08:53] atmospheric wind
[1:08:57] but it was really
[1:08:59] the breath of life
[1:09:01] from god giving soul life nephesh to the
[1:09:05] body of christ in the form of obedient
[1:09:07] believers who were full of faith and
[1:09:09] trusting in his word
[1:09:11] all of that from nue
[1:09:13] the greek word translated as wind
[1:09:17] is that us tonight
[1:09:19] are we together
[1:09:20] and individually part of that body
[1:09:23] have we received the life breath of god
[1:09:27] yeah but wait
[1:09:28] there's more
[1:09:30] what happened next
[1:09:32] there appeared unto them cloven tongues
[1:09:34] like as a fire
[1:09:37] and it sat upon each of them
[1:09:41] and they were all filled with the holy
[1:09:42] ghost
[1:09:44] and began to speak with other tongues as
[1:09:46] the spirit
[1:09:48] gave them utterance
[1:09:50] to speak requires breath
[1:09:54] we'll get to that in a little bit god
[1:09:56] breathed the breath of life into those
[1:09:58] who were obedient gathered in jerusalem
[1:10:00] while awaiting the fulfillment of the
[1:10:02] promise
[1:10:04] well
[1:10:05] i guess i'm going to go to another greek
[1:10:07] word here for just a moment ghost or
[1:10:09] spirit it's pneuma it comes from the
[1:10:12] same word the same root
[1:10:14] and it's tied into the same hebrew words
[1:10:17] that we've talked about
[1:10:18] but one of the words
[1:10:20] well there's two that are very
[1:10:22] interesting but i won't bore you with
[1:10:23] both of them i'll just bore you with one
[1:10:25] of them
[1:10:28] that means to inhale eagerly
[1:10:31] to snuff up to swallow to devour
[1:10:34] think again like cpr this wind came
[1:10:38] but those that were there the breath of
[1:10:40] god
[1:10:42] they took it in they inhaled it they
[1:10:44] wanted it they took it they accepted it
[1:10:46] they received it
[1:10:49] it means to suddenly and quickly inhale
[1:10:51] deeply i think peter and lydia can talk
[1:10:53] about something that happened just about
[1:10:55] a month ago where
[1:10:57] a little tiny human being took its first
[1:10:59] breath and i don't think it went
[1:11:05] i i think it was a little more dramatic
[1:11:07] than that
[1:11:09] and we're talking about new birth
[1:11:12] as we saw earlier there's a close tie
[1:11:15] with nephesh
[1:11:16] life blood
[1:11:18] breath air spirit ghost wind
[1:11:22] we saw the jewish belief
[1:11:25] cultural and religious
[1:11:27] that the nature of the life is tied with
[1:11:30] the blood the reason kosher animal
[1:11:33] slaughter ensures there's no remaining
[1:11:34] blood in the meat that's consumed by
[1:11:36] human
[1:11:38] as i mentioned at the conversation i had
[1:11:40] at the at the well and i don't know what
[1:11:42] you call it and uh
[1:11:44] i guess i call it sitting sheva in in uh
[1:11:47] in judaism where people gather together
[1:11:49] after person has died
[1:11:51] and reminisce and so forth and this
[1:11:53] person asked this question and about
[1:11:55] kosher
[1:11:56] and
[1:11:57] the lady there whose native tongue was
[1:11:59] hebrew says you take on the nature
[1:12:01] that's why they don't do it so there's
[1:12:03] there's there's uh
[1:12:05] you know you are what you eat
[1:12:07] well with this background
[1:12:09] with this context let's go back to our
[1:12:11] opening verses
[1:12:13] jesus said to them
[1:12:15] verily verily i say to you except you
[1:12:18] eat my flesh
[1:12:20] and drink my blood
[1:12:22] you're the walking dead you have no life
[1:12:24] in you
[1:12:26] who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[1:12:29] blood has eternal life
[1:12:31] and i will raise him up at the last day
[1:12:34] sounds like a promise to me for my flesh
[1:12:37] is meat indeed my blood is drink indeed
[1:12:39] he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[1:12:41] blood dwells lives in me and i live in
[1:12:44] him
[1:12:46] again we know that jesus was not
[1:12:48] referring to cannibalism
[1:12:50] to literally eat his body and drink his
[1:12:52] blood but his statements were so
[1:12:54] shocking
[1:12:55] that his audience thought that's what he
[1:12:57] meant
[1:12:59] and argued with them on that basis and
[1:13:02] jesus took great care to ensure that
[1:13:04] they would get that impression the
[1:13:06] disciples asked jesus at times how come
[1:13:08] you talk to people this way he says if i
[1:13:10] spoke cleanly they might get it and
[1:13:12] sometimes i don't really want him to get
[1:13:14] it right
[1:13:16] we also know
[1:13:17] the elements used in communion don't
[1:13:19] transform to human cells
[1:13:21] it's symbolic there is no
[1:13:23] transubstantiation
[1:13:25] but given the context of jewish culture
[1:13:28] and the tie-in with the nephesh soul
[1:13:31] life and blood
[1:13:32] what's going on
[1:13:35] is jesus somehow referring to the future
[1:13:38] christian observation of communion
[1:13:41] just to be clear the elements the bread
[1:13:44] and the wine a representation they're a
[1:13:46] symbol they're not somehow transformed
[1:13:48] into anything except what they are i'm
[1:13:51] going to read you several
[1:13:52] excerpts from things that brother
[1:13:54] branham said it's not something that i
[1:13:55] normally do a lot of but tonight it just
[1:13:58] that's how it came together so
[1:14:00] there we go
[1:14:01] and uh and and a message entitled
[1:14:04] communion from 1963 brother branham's
[1:14:06] praying is they're going to get ready to
[1:14:08] serve communion he says lord god
[1:14:11] creators of heaven and earth author of
[1:14:13] everlasting life
[1:14:14] giver of every good gift
[1:14:17] we thank you for this order that we
[1:14:19] could do this in remembrance of you as
[1:14:21] we fellowship as it was in your presence
[1:14:24] around the communion of god's grace
[1:14:26] we think within our own hearts that one
[1:14:28] day we were unworthy and now the blood
[1:14:31] of jesus christ has cleansed us from
[1:14:33] that sin and we stand together in
[1:14:36] heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:14:40] as the sacredness in the pain and
[1:14:41] suffering that he did at calvary when
[1:14:43] this body was broken he's talking about
[1:14:45] the broken bread that they're using in
[1:14:47] communion
[1:14:48] that he was wounded for our
[1:14:49] transgressions bruised for our iniquity
[1:14:52] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:14:55] with his stripes were healed that's why
[1:14:57] we taken this broken bread tonight god
[1:14:59] bless the believers and sanctify this
[1:15:01] kosher bread to be the representation
[1:15:05] of the body of jesus christ amen
[1:15:09] skipping down a few paragraphs he said
[1:15:11] lord jesus we present you this grape
[1:15:13] juice wine taken from the blood of the
[1:15:15] grape to represent the blood of jesus
[1:15:18] christ
[1:15:19] may as we receive it father may sickness
[1:15:22] depart from us may sin desire be taken
[1:15:25] from us may we live such holy
[1:15:27] consecrated life after this that men
[1:15:29] will see the reflection of jesus christ
[1:15:31] in us that our walk in life would be
[1:15:33] worthy of the gospel that we believe
[1:15:35] granted father
[1:15:37] sanctify this wine now for its intended
[1:15:39] use in jesus christ's name amen
[1:15:45] so speaking to his jewish audience as
[1:15:47] we've read in john jesus was simply but
[1:15:49] symbolically
[1:15:51] saying
[1:15:52] you must have my life in you
[1:15:55] that's the only life that's eternal
[1:15:58] that's what he's saying if communion is
[1:16:00] just symbolic how do we actually partake
[1:16:02] of that life
[1:16:03] receive his nature into ourselves so
[1:16:06] that we can become
[1:16:08] like him
[1:16:09] how do we
[1:16:11] drink his blood and eat his flesh
[1:16:14] the life of christ the very nature of
[1:16:16] god through his blood
[1:16:19] nephesh and breath
[1:16:21] by acceptance of that blood sacrifice
[1:16:23] his spiritual dna if you will and being
[1:16:26] resuscitated by his breath
[1:16:29] the holy spirit
[1:16:31] not just him breathing out
[1:16:33] but as we saw a few minutes ago with the
[1:16:35] day of pentecost are eagerly inhaling
[1:16:38] that same breath
[1:16:41] our role
[1:16:42] transferring that gift our role is not
[1:16:44] passive
[1:16:46] we must die daily to self
[1:16:49] and enter and strengthen and deepen that
[1:16:51] relationship taking on his nature more
[1:16:54] and more
[1:16:56] it isn't doctrine it isn't what you know
[1:16:58] it's not knowledge
[1:17:00] it's the blood
[1:17:01] the price of redemption to bring us back
[1:17:04] to god
[1:17:06] the very place we started
[1:17:09] you're familiar with the story brother
[1:17:11] branham told many times about cattle
[1:17:13] grazing in colorado
[1:17:15] i'd like to read one of those accounts
[1:17:17] to you this one was delivered in phoenix
[1:17:19] arizona in 1960.
[1:17:22] he says
[1:17:23] years ago i used to do quite a bit of
[1:17:25] writing first writing i ever did was up
[1:17:27] here at phoenix
[1:17:29] i thought i was a writer like my dad
[1:17:31] tila bronco piled me up a few times
[1:17:34] right out here in salt river valley he
[1:17:35] throwed me into a bunch of cactus out
[1:17:37] there one day
[1:17:38] i was in awful shape for a week or two
[1:17:41] trying to chase a burro down right off
[1:17:43] 16th street 33 years ago that would have
[1:17:46] been 1927 he would have been 18 years
[1:17:48] old
[1:17:49] i remember over in colorado the hereford
[1:17:52] association grazes the troublesome river
[1:17:55] valley
[1:17:57] and many times when we take the cattle
[1:17:59] up there have i set with my leg wrapped
[1:18:01] around the horn of the saddle while the
[1:18:03] ranger was checking these cattle going
[1:18:05] through the gate
[1:18:06] the drift fence gate
[1:18:08] and there was the turkey track there was
[1:18:10] the lazy k the diamond t mr grimes the
[1:18:14] tripod which was mr heverez who i was
[1:18:17] with
[1:18:18] mr zwollen the a different ones going
[1:18:20] through which every man could raise a
[1:18:22] ton of hay could put a cow on the
[1:18:24] pasture for the summer
[1:18:26] but i noticed the ranger never even
[1:18:29] checked the brands
[1:18:30] he looked in their ear for the blood tag
[1:18:32] because nothing could go in that forest
[1:18:34] except it was a registered hereford
[1:18:37] and that's the way it's going to be at
[1:18:38] the big gate someday
[1:18:40] god don't care what brand you're wearing
[1:18:42] he's going to look at the blood tag of
[1:18:44] his own son
[1:18:45] for it's the blood of jesus christ he
[1:18:47] won't watch the brand
[1:18:49] he'll watch the blood not when i see the
[1:18:52] brand when i see the blood
[1:18:54] i'll pass over you
[1:18:56] now we're all very familiar with this
[1:18:58] story
[1:18:59] but have you ever noticed
[1:19:01] that every hereford going into that
[1:19:04] pasture
[1:19:06] in addition to the blood tag
[1:19:08] had a brand
[1:19:10] they didn't get in because they had a
[1:19:12] brand
[1:19:13] but they did have a brand
[1:19:16] brother branham said god don't care what
[1:19:17] brand you're wearing but
[1:19:19] we can sure make a big deal about it
[1:19:21] sometimes
[1:19:23] we think of denominations
[1:19:26] but let's bring it down home
[1:19:28] it applies equally well to
[1:19:30] interpretations and factions within our
[1:19:32] own ranks
[1:19:34] listen to what he says
[1:19:36] next
[1:19:39] satan has blowed his breath of poison
[1:19:43] i think of the words to that song that's
[1:19:45] why i was so happy that
[1:19:47] sang it earlier no chilling wind
[1:19:50] nor poisonous breath
[1:19:52] can reach that healthful shore
[1:19:56] i also think of the coven pandemic i'm
[1:19:58] glad my brother noel was here i got the
[1:20:00] the third shot the other day and i was
[1:20:02] feeling kind of whacked from it and noel
[1:20:04] came and said
[1:20:06] so he put his hands on me and prayed and
[1:20:08] i ran out of excuses in a few minutes
[1:20:12] but but what happens with coven
[1:20:15] death is spread by breath poisonous
[1:20:18] breath
[1:20:19] breathing in
[1:20:21] what one who is infected has
[1:20:23] breathed out
[1:20:25] and most who are spreading it don't
[1:20:26] believe they're infected
[1:20:28] they haven't yet developed symptoms
[1:20:31] or they ascribe the symptoms to
[1:20:33] something else
[1:20:35] oh my
[1:20:36] reading on satan has blown his breath of
[1:20:39] poison to speak
[1:20:42] we breathe out
[1:20:44] satan's poisonous breath is carrying
[1:20:46] this message which he's saying all these
[1:20:49] people don't believe like you
[1:20:52] oh my
[1:20:54] it just it ain't what you believe it's
[1:20:57] who you believe believe on the lord
[1:21:00] jesus christ and thou shalt be saved
[1:21:03] on the lord
[1:21:05] i think of that song have you been to
[1:21:07] jesus for the cleansing power
[1:21:10] are you washed in the blood of the lamb
[1:21:14] like noel i can't sing either but i'm
[1:21:15] unwilling to admit it are you fully
[1:21:18] trusting in his grace this hour who be
[1:21:21] washed in the blood of the lamb
[1:21:25] there are so many factions
[1:21:27] that we allow to divide us
[1:21:30] to separate us
[1:21:32] to isolate us
[1:21:35] we do it to ourselves
[1:21:37] and what is it
[1:21:39] satan's poisonous breath they don't
[1:21:42] believe the same way you do
[1:21:44] they don't wind up exactly i've i've
[1:21:47] said this many times i've heard it said
[1:21:48] that if if god could find 10 10 people
[1:21:51] to agree fully that the rapture would
[1:21:53] take place and my response to that has
[1:21:55] always been where are the other nine
[1:22:00] we have our brand
[1:22:02] some churches only play recordings
[1:22:04] some excommunicate you if you don't do
[1:22:06] what their pastor says or see the tent
[1:22:08] vision the way they see it or an
[1:22:10] airplane or a return ministry or a
[1:22:13] zillion other things
[1:22:15] brother branham called it satan's breath
[1:22:17] of poison
[1:22:19] saying all these people don't believe
[1:22:21] like you
[1:22:24] we need the breath of god
[1:22:26] that neshama
[1:22:28] in our lives and in our souls
[1:22:32] not the breath of satan i think of that
[1:22:34] song
[1:22:35] and you know you can sing it with me
[1:22:37] maybe not the same off-key that i have
[1:22:39] let it breathe on me
[1:22:42] let it breathe on me
[1:22:46] let the breath of god
[1:22:50] now breathe on me
[1:22:53] brings us life
[1:22:55] revival
[1:22:56] resuscitation
[1:22:58] nephesh from god's breath
[1:23:02] giving us that life
[1:23:04] regardless of our brand
[1:23:07] they're going to be christians of every
[1:23:09] stripe in heaven
[1:23:10] a multitude no man can number according
[1:23:13] to john in the revelation
[1:23:15] i've talked about that before the greek
[1:23:17] number system ends at about 400 million
[1:23:19] so john was limited to 400 million
[1:23:22] when he got to 400 million he had to
[1:23:24] stop right no man could number it was a
[1:23:27] crowd that was there
[1:23:29] i recall the story i i heard brother
[1:23:32] aaron say it many times i think brother
[1:23:34] green said it too about the guy going to
[1:23:36] heaven
[1:23:37] and he's being given a guided tour
[1:23:39] around there and he goes to this noisy
[1:23:41] group over here and he says these are
[1:23:42] the pentecostals and he goes to this
[1:23:44] group over here says well these are
[1:23:46] these are the baptists and then they
[1:23:48] cross over this hill and you say
[1:23:50] be very quiet be very quiet
[1:23:53] those are the people that claim to
[1:23:55] follow brother branham and they think
[1:23:57] they're the only ones that are here
[1:24:01] well a final excerpt
[1:24:04] this time from communion in 1962.
[1:24:07] he says this will do brother neville
[1:24:09] lots of good i've seen a presbyterian
[1:24:11] minister out of the greatest
[1:24:13] presbyterian college in this nation
[1:24:15] dancing in the spirit
[1:24:17] oh my it was really something he
[1:24:19] received the holy ghost and then he told
[1:24:21] me he said i got one of your tapes said
[1:24:24] wasn't very good
[1:24:26] said it was just kind of jumpy but said
[1:24:28] i took it right into my college and
[1:24:29] played it and being the great man of
[1:24:32] psychology there he kept them all quiet
[1:24:34] well they got here at once anyhow he
[1:24:36] said
[1:24:37] and he said
[1:24:38] he he said he got to dancing at this in
[1:24:40] the spirit at his church after he
[1:24:42] received the holy ghost and they said
[1:24:46] reverend when are you going to learn a
[1:24:47] new step
[1:24:49] and he said when my congregation learns
[1:24:51] this one
[1:24:53] i thought that was pretty cute you know
[1:24:54] presbyterian hierarchy yes said when my
[1:24:56] congregation learns this one so that's a
[1:24:58] good thing just like a little baby just
[1:25:00] knew and yet he's been well you know
[1:25:01] we'd have to be to be the professor of
[1:25:03] psychology at the greatest presbyterian
[1:25:05] college in
[1:25:06] boston well it's in the united states i
[1:25:09] i've seen one of mayo's head heart
[1:25:11] surgeons preach the gospel in the spirit
[1:25:14] and speak in tongues oh my
[1:25:16] i seen another specialist which was a
[1:25:18] seventh day adventist uh he was a
[1:25:20] specialist of the heart and throat also
[1:25:22] an old man received the baptism of the
[1:25:24] holy ghost he received it one night i
[1:25:26] laid hands on him over in the courts and
[1:25:28] he received the holy ghost
[1:25:30] so just so many things our lord did were
[1:25:32] thankful for and especially seeing at
[1:25:35] this time
[1:25:36] our musicians would be kind enough to
[1:25:38] come at this time
[1:25:40] and maybe play
[1:25:42] softly let it breathe on me
[1:25:44] notice brother branham's not talking
[1:25:46] about anointed ones at the end time he's
[1:25:48] not talking about
[1:25:50] he says that these people received
[1:25:53] the baptism of the holy spirit that's
[1:25:55] christ in you
[1:25:56] not just the anointing of christ on you
[1:25:59] they had different plans brands
[1:26:03] but the right blood tag
[1:26:05] the holy spirit the breath of god
[1:26:08] the life
[1:26:10] not because of the brand
[1:26:12] but because of the blood
[1:26:14] representing
[1:26:16] the nephesh
[1:26:18] you are what you eat
[1:26:20] what are we eating
[1:26:22] what life do we want to possess
[1:26:25] and manifest

[1:26:34] grateful for the power of words we're
[1:26:37] grateful that

[1:32:41] [Music]
[1:32:51] a mercy
[1:32:54] [Music]
[1:33:06] i really like that thought when he
[1:33:08] breathed they had to take it in
[1:33:10] or else it just would have been winded
[1:33:13] in the building
[1:33:15] but if you take it in
[1:33:17] when he comes by and says lord
[1:33:19] i surrender
[1:33:20] i receive come live in this place
[1:33:24] come come be the life my life
[1:33:27] not me but christ in me
[1:33:29] amen that's
[1:33:31] sometimes just a simplicity
[1:33:32] [Music]
[1:33:34] sometimes words can be confusing
[1:33:37] and sometimes somebody uses a lot of
[1:33:39] words to try to explain something
[1:33:42] but just taking that simple definition
[1:33:44] of
[1:33:45] it's the life of christ in you
[1:33:47] it's he himself dwelling in you amen
[1:33:50] there was a song and i just know a
[1:33:52] portion i won't even try to sing
[1:33:54] but you are the air i breathe
[1:33:57] i don't know the rest of the words but
[1:33:59] it just kept coming yes that is true
[1:34:03] it is him
[1:34:04] he is our breath he is our hope he is
[1:34:06] our everything
[1:34:08] he is our all in all let's just bow our
[1:34:10] hands lord
[1:34:13] how how sometimes in our own minds
[1:34:17] in our own thinking
[1:34:20] we're doing our best to make sense of it
[1:34:21] to make to make it understanding so
[1:34:23] maybe that we could say yes i can
[1:34:24] believe it that way lord
[1:34:27] but sometimes we confuse it more
[1:34:30] if we'll just let you do
[1:34:32] what you desired when you came to adam
[1:34:35] and and you had created that body but
[1:34:37] there was no life in it yet
[1:34:40] all you could do was breathe
[1:34:43] into that which you had
[1:34:44] created and then it received the breath
[1:34:47] of life
[1:34:48] and became a living soul
[1:34:51] let that be to each one that has never
[1:34:53] had that experience lord
[1:34:55] of receiving the holy ghost receiving
[1:34:57] the breath of god in their life
[1:34:59] may they receive it lord and become a
[1:35:01] living soul heart
[1:35:03] something that changes us something that
[1:35:06] that overcoming power living in us to
[1:35:08] live a daily life worthy of the gospel
[1:35:11] we cannot do it by intellect we cannot
[1:35:13] do it by our own understanding we cannot
[1:35:15] do it by our own physical strength lord
[1:35:18] it takes christ in us lord and that's
[1:35:20] your desire lord help us to eat of your
[1:35:23] flesh and drink of your blood lord take
[1:35:26] of your life daily we pray
[1:35:28] in jesus christ's name
