seats God bless you all well it's the the last chapter of This Book of Acts and it's been I I got to tell you I've enjoyed it I say this every time that I open the book every time that I come up here to minister I have thoroughly enjoyed the book of Acts learning about it and it blessed me so much last service is brother Lyall was preaching and he was talking about when he closed he was talking about this man Luke and how Luke as I said never knew Jesus that we know of Luke did research and he interviewed people like we would do what was he like tell me about what he said and and all of this this letter that this Apostle Luke put together all the research that he did and he he wrote it for this man theopolis and he sends him this letter he gives him this book that he wrote the Book of Luke about Jesus and then he writes another letter and he says theopolis he says remember all that I wrote the first letter the first part that I wrote about this man Jesus he says there's a part two to all this and and Luke puts together this book of Acts the first part of it he probably wasn't present but then he slips pronouns in there saying that I was there and I was Along on this on this ship and I was with Paul and I was there when when this boy fell out of the Loft and landed on the street and died I was there and he writes to this theopolis and says this is what Jesus continued to do if you look in your Bible it probably says the Acts of the Apostles the proper word of the proper title of course is the acts of the holy spirit in the apostles and think about Luke and and how he must have felt when he finally met this man the Apostle Paul and he looked and he says all of that I've learned about Jesus all of these years that I put together this book and all this work that I've done I can see this Same Spirit of this man Jesus that I learned about in this man the Apostle Paul I think about as I said last time how my grandfather he he was they were listening to the radio one I believe it was a Saturday they were listening to the radio and this man was preaching way up it was first of all it was a miracle that they even heard the broadcast and they were listening to this man my grandpa he was he was thinking wow this is something that I've never heard before just like Luke he says this is exactly what I read about in the Bible so he went up and he heard this man named William brandom and he said here it is this is that same Spirit as Luke said this is the same that happened theopolis this is the second part of this so my grandpa he starts following this man around the country just as Luke followed the Apostle Paul going around as I said before before I was in a ship this time I was in a station wagon it was in Canada and it was in California and it was in Missouri and it was in Indiana and down to Georgia in his own house and then down into Florida and all over followed this man go up to a place called Philadelphia they're up there and the one that organized all the meetings he said hey I've seen you all all over the place everywhere we go you and your family in this car every everywhere everywhere we go you're you're there he said would you like to meet brother branam my grandpa said yeah so he said said I think I can set up a breakfast for you so brother brandom my grandpa sister brandham my grandma and Brother Joseph brandham was was a young boy and what had happened the week before was my grandfather and my uncle Ronnie were out fishing and if you know brother bram's message you've probably heard the story they were out fishing and my grandfather I think the lemon on bass was probably eight or 10 and my grandfather and my uncle had caught three potato sacks full of bass far more than the limit obviously so they took these big these big sacks of fish after they were finished and they put them in the in the back of the car and they're driving and the and it's dark and they're driving down the road and my grandpa sees headlights out in front of him and he says that's only one thing I can think that would be out here at this time of night let's stop and let's hide these fish so they stop they take the fish out of the car they put them in the bushes just in time that the headlights come up to them and it's what he thought it was the game W and he looked at him and he says how many fish do you have my grandpa and my uncle smelling like fish scales fish scales on them fishing poles oh we don't have any and he says okay he says well let me see you in your car so he looks in the car no fish in the trunk no fish he says you sure nope we don't have any fish so he drives off they go back out pick up the sacks put them back in the car they go driving and they're driving along and they see lights over over here stop they get out they jump out they hide the sacks in the in the in the bushes they jump out right in time the headlights is what they thought all right let me see your fish I know I know you're hiding them like I told you before they're not here I don't have any fish he looks looks again no fish all right go ahead game Mor's he's going to get them they take off again once again it happens my grandpa was a step ahead of the law he hid the fish again in the bushes gay Mor comes searches the car again he gives up they go on home the next weekend they're up in Philadelphia they get to have breakfast with this man of God they're sitting there and they're sitting across from each other and there on the wall is a painting and that painting is of a lake brother brandom looks at my [Music] grandfather and he says brother Evans he says uh that looks like a good place to fish doesn't it and grandpa said yes sir it does and he said he said brother Evans he said I saw a man he said he said do you like the fish my grandpa saides sir I do he said 'I saw a man and he said this man broke the law my grandpa said yes sir he said he caught far too many fish and he had these three sacks of fish and he said he had them in his car yes sir and he saw the game warden coming and he took those sacks of fish and he hit them in the bushes just before the game warden came yes sir and he said he did that three times he said he was breaking the law my grandpa said brother brand I'm guilty I did it I'm I'm guilty he said will you forgive me brother Bram said I'll forgive you if you take me down to that place fishing so then they became very close friends so they went down to this place in Florida and they went fishing and they were catching these these big beautiful bass and my grandfather they were fishing with these long poles these long cane poles and they have a popper on the end and they throw it out doesn't even have a reel on it they throw it out a and then they they pop it like this and then the bass comes and grabs it and then they pull them in but there's no real they just pull the line in and the and the rod is so long that they can get the fish so he's brother brandom's fishing and he gets this big bass on and it's it gets hung up in the weeds and it's a it's it was a fish that he had been trying to there was a big one in this little area it a swampy area there was this big fish in there brother Brandon would get him on and he'd get off so he he gets this fish on and it's a big one but it's not that same fish and he gets hung up in the weeds and my grandfather says brother brandom I'll come down to help you and he goes going down to the water and he steps and just before he gets to the water he steps in a rattlesnake bites him on the top of the foot didn't see it right on the edge of the water my grandfather jumps back and he's barefooted which I think my grandfather lived 90% of his life barefooted and he he looks down it starts to swell this would be important later on it starts to swell and it starts to hurt my grandpa sits down on the bank and his foot he said and I remember him saying this he said it was throbbing and swelling and he said it hurt so bad that the tears were coming from his eyes and the the man that was with them he goes over to brother brandom and my grandfather's watching him he goes over to brother Branham and he says brother brandham brother Evans was bitten by a snake and brother brandham just keeps fishing does even acknowledge that he said it he just keeps fishing and after a while my grandfather's looking at him and brother brandom takes his fishing pole and he sets it down and he walks over to my grandfather who's sitting on the bank and he says these words he says where did he get you brother Evans my grandfather shows him the two bite marks on the top of his foot and the swelling the swelling leg they're way back in there it was this was a pretty dangerous situation because they're so far and if if you know about snake bites when you start to exercise to get back it starts to spread the venom through the body and can cause more and more damage so brother brandom walks up to him and he he says where did he get you brother Evans and my grandfather shows him and he lays his hand on my grandpa and he said Lord Lord it is written in your word listen to my words Lord it is written in your word that they shall tread on serpents and scorpions and nothing by any means will harm them my grandpa as he's he he's sitting there and brother Brandon's praying for him the pain completely left at the moment that the prophet started praying he gets up he goes he says no pain at all brother brandom brother Bram says well do you want to go back you want to go back home or do you want to stay fishing he said brother B we came here to fish I'm fine so they continued to fish all day they came my grandfather owned a gas station they went to the gas station my dad was there they get back and of course everybody's greeting brother brother bandam and everything and and my my grandpa tells my dad he says listen to this he says I was bitten by a snake and he still didn't have a shoes on sister Shirley so he's he's he says look at this and there were two holes in the top of his foot and my Grandpa took took his two fingers his two thumbs together and pressed the two holes together and dad said a little bit of blood popped out he says oh bitten by a rattlesnake right there it swelling everything brother Brandon laid his hands on me said they shall tread on serpents and scorpion and it just all went away and he says I'm fine in my my dad's uncle was standing right there he says Welch and he was still crippled from a snake bite that he had had months earlier and he said wel he said it's okay to be religious but it's not okay to be stupid you need to go to the hospital my grandpa said if God can take me if he could heal me then he can take me all the way through it happened a chapter 28 Paul and the crew of the doomed ship are now ship dreck as brother Lyall told us before made their way to land and when we are escaped when we who's talking here Luke I was there I saw it and when they were escaped they knew that the island was called Malta and the barbar's PE people showed us no little kindness for they kindled a fire and received every one of us because of the present rain and because of the cold and when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire there came a viper out of the Heat and fastened on his hand and when The Barbarians saw the venomous Beast hang on his hand they said among themselves no doubt this man is a murderer whom though he hath escaped the sea yet Vengeance suffereth not to live and he shook off the Beast Into the Fire and felt no harm how be it they looked when he should have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly but after they had looked a great while and saw no harm come to him they changed their minds and said that he was a God so these people saw the power of God in this man maybe they didn't know better they hadn't they hadn't been taught differently there wasn't a Christian Pastor there maybe to tell them that it's not right to worship this man so friends sometimes if people see the power of God or they have seen the power of God and they make a mistake and put this man in a place that maybe God didn't Place him we should have patience on those people too so we see that this Paul was bitten by this snake and he shakes it off into the fire and let me read to you another account from I've given you a testimony and now I've I've read a testimony I want to read to you now the words of our Lord Jesus let's turn to Luke chapter 10 brother I'm sorry I didn't give you these scriptures Luke chapter 10 verse 17 and the 70 returned again with Joy saying Lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name and he said unto them I beheld Satan is lightning falling from Heaven fall from Heaven behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you let me tell you this book of Acts has not ended as we can as we can see from from these testimonies let's also turn to Mark chap 16 very famous and familiar verse to all of us I can quote it by heart but I I'd better read it Mark chapter 16 verse 15 Jesus says go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover what an amazing what an amazing thing that the the Lord Jesus prophesied right there and we see it right here and Paul picking up these sticks there was a snake in in the stick and bit him I wonder if Paul maybe knew what the Lord Jesus had said he shakes it off into the fire he says I am about my father's business I am preaching the gospel I am in the perfect will of God Satan you have no part with me you can't harm me you can't do anything I am commissioned by God to preach this gospel and he throws a snake in the fire verse number seven the book of Acts chapter 28 in the same quarters were possessions of the chief men Chief man on the island whose name was pus who received us and lodged us three days courteously now remember the Roman Empire was ruling the world at that time including this island where they were stranded on pus was most likely the Roman governor of this area or of this island and it came to pass that the father of pu of pus lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux to whom Paul entered in and prayed and laid his hands on him Mark 16 and laid his hands on him and healed him so when this was done others also would which had diseases in the island came and were healed friends this is another example and they're all over this is another example of how important Divine Healing is to the gospel how important Miracles are to the gospel we should have faith not only for our own healing but that also these people who aren't Believers like these these people on Malta were obviously not Believers but so they also can be healed and that they can receive the Gospel a gospel that's not dead but a gospel that is alive and here Paul is constantly showing that Jesus Christ is alive in me and I am carrying on I'll read verse n again so when this was done others also which had disease in the island diseases in the island came and were healed who also honored us with many honors and when we departed they lated us with such things as were necessary so these people thought the world of Paul gave him great honors and even even so that all of these I I remember how many it was a couple hundred people that they even gave them all supplies for their Journey kind people on this island and they certainly benefited from the Apostle and his team being there and after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the aisle whose sign was casor and Pollock that that word sign I love the detail of Luke it's it's really neat to me because if you're reading this book of Acts when Paul is speaking in first person he says us you'll notice the details get really tight even so much as he said that the sign basically these are probably Gods because these are Romans or these are these are in the Roman Empire these are probably gods that they thought would protect the ship and they're the sign that's in the front of the ship this caster and Pollock and landing at Syracuse we t there 3 days and from then we fetched a compass and came to regim and after one day the south wind blew and we came the next day to tioli where we found Brethren and were desired to T with them seven days and so we went toward Rome and from then that's a big stop right there and we went to Rome Paul knew that his destination was going to be Rome I don't know if he knew what was going to happen in Rome but he knew that the Lord had told him to go and that he would be witness in Rome and from then when the Brethren heard of us they came to meus as far as ai ai Forum the three taverns whom when Paul saw he thanked God and took courage most translations say the three ends and when we came came to Rome the Centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the Guard but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him now this is this is a very interesting thing that happens right here that Paul was to dwell with a soldier and this Soldier basically was in charge of Paul now probably wasn't just one soldier it was probably soldiers that were working a shift and they worked some so many hours and then they went to the next Soldier and they stayed with Paul 24 hours a day most likely because Paul was this prisoner this pretty high-profile prisoner they were most likely whoever it was was most likely chained to Paul so they were locked together whoever this guard was and Paul and it came to pass that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews to together and when they were come together he said unto them men and Brethren though I have committed nothing against the people or customs of your of our fathers yet I was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans now remember he's speaking to the Jews here who when they had examined me would have let me go because there was no cause of death in me but when the Jews spake against it I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar not that I had ought to accuse my nation of this are very interesting I talked with brother Lyle about this before and as I've read the commentaries on the book of Acts no one that I have found has said what I think really happened here and if you you look at Paul he had the spirit of Christ which was to give his life for his Brethren as I said this morning Jesus and the Jews is considered his Brethren his house now the Jews if you remember with Felix and fesus and agria a couple couple um chapters ago that Paul was Paul had something that none of the others most of the others Jews didn't have and maybe those that were on trial didn't have he had as uh as it could be said well I won't I'll say it sometimes Paul had an ace that no one really knew about do you remember what it was he was a Roman citizen Paul's dad had paid to become a Roman Paul was born after his dad had paid that great price so now Paul was entitled to every right that a Roman citizen had it would be like an immigrant coming to the United States and going through the immigration process and having a child that child is a born United States citizen and that's what Paul was so when Paul came before this trial Paul had had certain rights that the Jews didn't have and one of those rights was to face his accusers and if those accusers would accuse Paul and they couldn't back up their story or they didn't show up then Paul was set free but the law went after his accusers so here's Paul and he makes the statement and I say could it be he saysi was constrained to appeal to Caesar which was his right to go to the courts in Rome the Roman courts I was constrained to appeal to Caesar not that I had ought to accuse my nation of so if Paul if he would have not appealed to Caesar then fesus or Felix whichever one the ruler was at that time would have said okay by Roman law he's a Roman now we need to go after the accusers I wonder if Paul was a protecting those that accused him and lied about him so he says this so he appeals to Caesar at that time and when you appeal to Caesar fesus it's like well now it's out of my hands which was probably a big burden off of Festus Agrippa the king of the Jews he's like well I'm I'm pretty much done too so now it's like all right we don't have to worry about Paul anymore now Paul's not a problem in Jerusalem either remember all the Uproar that was going on they wanted to kill Paul and they hated him and they they they said all these wrong things like he brought a gentile into the temple and defamed or defiled the temple which he didn't do but they accused him of it and it caused this big uproar and all the gossip went around you know how how was what if you've been on if you've been following the book of Acts how all of this happened and all of a sudden here come the Roman Centurion and and the Roman guard and they grab Paul and they protect him and they bring him before the law the Roman law and Paul divulges I'm a Roman citizen then he appeals to Caesar being as innocent as he was verse number 20 for this cause therefore I have called for you to see you and to speak with you because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain he's talking to the Jews he's witnessing to the Jews for the hope of Israel what is he talking about for the hope of Israel what did I say this morning that all through the Old Testament they were speaking of this man the Messiah prophecy after prophecy after prophecy I Isaiah said that this man would be born of a virgin Micah said that he would be born in Bethlehem David said in the Psalms that he would be a high priest after the order of melkisedek Zechariah said he would be called King David said in the Psalms that Messiah would be betrayed David also said in the Psalms that he would be falsely accused Isaiah said he would be spit on and beaten David in the psalm said he would be hated Without a Cause Isaiah said that he would be crucified with criminals David said in the Psalms that his hands and his feet would be pierced David said he would be forsaken by God David said in the Psalms that he would be buried with the rich and that he would raised from the dead David said in the Psalms that the Messiah would Ascend up to heaven and that he would be seated on the right hand of God that was the hope of Israel that Paul is talking about this man that had been prophesied so much had come and you missed him you missed the Hope Israel and they said unto him we neither received Letters Out of Judea concerning thee neither any of the Brethren that came showed or spake any harm of thee basically we don't know we don't think any evil of you we don't really really know anything about you but we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest for as concerning this sect we know that everywhere it is spoken against so they know they they've heard that this group of the nazarenes all evil is spoken of it all that we've heard about this group has been that they're false he's a false prophet comparing him to the to the one that brought all of these people out into the desert and they all got killed out there they all died out there comparing him his mother had an affair with with a Roman soldier and he's an illegitimate child and all of these bad things we've heard all of these bad things about this sect of Judaism that you're from I was one time when I was in the ministry in Jeffersonville I got a phone call and he was this man he was an Anglican priest a congregation and and he he tells me he says um he was obviously a scholar and he said I found this man named William brandom on this website called believe the sign and he said I found it on this other website and he says as I was reading he says I didn't know how anyone could be as evil as they are portraying this man William brandham to be he said he said I I I I don't understand how anyone could have been that bad and he said so in reading all of this stuff that I found on the internet I knew that this man there must be something right about this man or why would so many people speak so evil about him and this man's name is David we had some great conversations um obviously I lost touch with them but uh he really believed started listening to brother brandom he he um would call me and say oh I heard him say this and this was this was just wonderful and this is and he had all had his Bibles all out and everything and he said now this is this place in the Bible and the the um the intellectual um angle that he always had was uh was just was just tremendous but the same thing is happening here in these Jews he's like they're like hey we've heard really really bad things about this so what's the deal and when they appointed him when they had appointed him a day there came many to him into his lodging this is where Paul was in prison but he was imprisoned in a house with this Roman soldier chained to him to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God persuading them concerning Jesus both out of the law of Moses and out of the prophets from morning till evening notice what Paul was preaching very plainly says right here what Paul was preaching he wasn't preaching himself he wasn't preaching Moses he wasn't preaching any of the prophets he was taking the prophet's messages and introducing Christ through the prophet's messages we should should be doing the same thing and some believed the things which were spoken and some believe not and I I I think about remember verse 16 when he had that wrong that soldier that was with him that was chained to him you think that that Paul has has these people coming and and some of them will believe what he said that that he introduces the Messiah to them and he he tells them he says here it is in Moses here it is in all of the prophets have spoken this from Micah to Isaiah to Moses all the way from Genesis all the way to the current time and he's showing them these things and some were like wow this is incredible this is the truly the Messiah and others were like I don't believe it Paul was the master teacher so when we witness to people and we should be all the time remember I said this morning the alarm went off so get them in get these people in do anything that you can to get them to Christ and here was Paul with the same urgency he knew that his end was coming introducing people to the Lord Jesus doing Miracles and and preaching to them all day every day amazing some believed and some didn't and it is so frustrating Paul it it obviously upsets him as what you're going to hear and it it was amazing to me as I was reading this that even the greatest teacher maybe ever that has ever walked the Earth this man Paul there were still so many who didn't believe it and when they agreed not among themselves they departed and after that Paul had spoken one word well spake the Holy Ghost by isaas the prophet the word asaas is Isaiah the prophet unto our fathers and he's going to quote some scripture here he was frustrated he was upset how can you not believe this have I not showed you in all the scriptures with your intellectual pompous attitude to your Pharisee way you want me to show you in the scriptures I'll show you in the scriptures you won't believe it you want me to show you in real life you want me to show you the Miracles you want me to do these things I do it and you still don't believe here's the Apostle Paul and I think of this Roman looking at him like wow I wonder how many Romans well we know many of them came to the Lord you know what we do know there's a uh there's a scripture that I want to read but let's keep going Paul is upset these these Jews are like well you know well some of us will agree with you some of them say well I'll hear more about this did they really were they really sincere did they really want to know the truth well spake the Holy Ghost by Isaiah the prophet unto our fathers saying go unto this people and saying hearing you shall hear and shall not understand and seeing you shall see and not perceive for the heart of this people is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes have have they closed lest they should see with their eyes I'm not going to look at it I'm not going to listen to it I just want my religion don't don't say anything to me I don't want to hear anything I I could be led astray they Clos their ears they Clos Their Eyes For The Heart of the people has waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes have they closed they closed them themselves lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them quoting Isaiah the prophet be it known therefore unto you that salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles and that they will hear it these were Paul's people these were the ones that that he loved one more chance it was always one more chance and he kept preaching to them he kept going into their synagogues just listen just believe me and they kept hating him and hating him and finally he said you know what be it known unto you that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles these people that you think are less than you these people that you say are heathens and not even worthy to take a breath remember when Paul let's see who was it when they they would uh oh yeah it was Paul when when Paul said he was talking he he shook His Garment and he said let let I forgot what it was but when the Jews would leave a gentile country or Gentile area they would stop once they got across the line and they would dust everything off because of the stinking rotten low down Gentile dust and that was their attitude towards the Gentiles and here is Paul saying you know what it's going to the Gentiles because they'll they'll receive it sometimes I feel the same way I feel like come on Believe get off of yourself listen to this gospel give your heart to the Lord Jesus and quit with your doctrines and everything else that separates people stop it and just come to Christ be it known therefore unto you that salvation of God is sent unto the gentille and they will hear it and when he had said these words the Jews departed and had great reasoning among themselves I bet they did but they still wouldn't give up their own doctrines and traditions and Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house and received all that came unto him remember Paul was guarded 247 and as Paul was in this house as he was in basically house arrest Paul had the opportunity to do something that we might not think would be a big deal today but it is Paul was able to write letters while he was there in prison now we think everybody wants to get in the not everybody but some people want to get into the pull pit and they want to preach and you reach I don't know what we have 50 people here tonight you reach 50 people and that's what happened was Paul Paul people were coming in and and Paul was reaching them but his ministry was so much greater with these letters that he wrote so much so that we can read them today the same letters Philippians Paul says in Philippians 1 Paul says that he's writing from Rome and he says these things that have happened to me have actually happened for the furtherance of the Gospel so it's become evident to the whole Palace guard it's become evident to all of these Romans The Men Who were guarding him every day that even they were hearing the gospel of Paul the Roman guard there chained to Paul listening to this man I would have loved would you not have loved to hear him chain to him I wonder how many of these guards that Paul led to the Lord I'll tell you I know for sure there were some because of this scripture I'm going to read Philippians chapter 4 yeah right here so Philippians is is a letter that Paul wrote from this house arrest from Rome verse 21 he says this brother I'm sorry I didn't give you any of these scriptures I just they're they're uh oh they're in the Bible here we go so Paul in closing his letter to the Philippians he says this salute every saint in Christ Jesus the Brethren which are with me greet you all the saints Salute You chiefly they that that are of Caesar's household brother Lyall that's those Roman guards and it says the Saints Salute You chiefly these Roman guards that have been with me this whole time they've given their heart to the Lord Jesus also for two years Paul preached from this house and he showed that we don't have to have a Pulpit to preach we don't have to have a church to preach at we can preach to each other we can preach to the Lost we can preach to the Sinners whoever comes by you can we can be like Paul when he didn't have a church he wasn't preaching in a synagogue here yet this is the most successful time of his whole Ministry in Rome and Paul is preaching to one by one they come in his little house maybe two by two three or four they come into his little house and and he preaches the Lord Jesus through all of the prophets back to Acts chapter 28 I'll read 30 again and Paul dwelt two old years in his own hired house and received all that came unto him preaching the kingdom of God and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence no man forbidding him and that's the last verse Paul I mean we have Luke here the author highly Highly Educated very very very good writer and that's it every try to find a book in the in the in the New Testament try to find one that doesn't end with amen he doesn't even put amen here he says preaching the kingdom of God and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence no man forbidding him where's the next verse it's because the book of Acts never ended it's going on today 2,000 [Applause] years I'm going to clap it didn't end as I said this Apostle Luke this man this great man that followed Paul around how wonderful he was and and you just read both his first letter and his second and how inspiring and how beautiful they are and he on purpose doesn't even say Amen again tonight when you get home go through the New Testament find a book that doesn't end in amen I think there's one other one maybe two but he doesn't he doesn't say amen he just says and he continued teaching so what happened was Paul taught for a couple years in this house and and there's different accounts we don't know for sure what happened but he may have been let go and brought back to prison we don't know we don't know exactly what was going on in these in these couple years but we do know that Paul's life did come to an end and his ministry well his ministry never came to an end because of these Epistles that we have the last thing that Paul wrote let's turn to the end the last chapter of second Timothy second Timothy 4 here we have a while later Paul back in Rome probably never left maybe left we don't know but he is definitely in Rome here and he's writing his closing statements his last words to me the greatest of them all of all the Apostles of all the prophets of all of them besides our lord Jesus was this man Paul and here he is in his last words to this man Timothy who he was trying to encourage and these words to the Gentile church this second Timothy was written in Greek it was written written so the Gentiles could read it chapter 4 I'll read the whole chapter Paul says this speaking to Timothy he says I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing in his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove re rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and Doctrine musicians can come exhort with all longsuffering and Doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lusts shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy Ministry get out and win souls to Christ Timothy and everybody else who reads this letter for I Paul for I am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all the them also that love his appearing let's raise our hands if we are numbered with those people but unto all

Jesus in the Apostle notwithstanding the Lord stood with me and strengthen Me That by me the preaching might be fully known and that all the Gentiles might hear and I was delivered out of the mouth of
