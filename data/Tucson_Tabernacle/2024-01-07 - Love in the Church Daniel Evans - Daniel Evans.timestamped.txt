[25:41] evening nothing but the blood of Jesus
[25:44] Amen
[25:47] sometimes at least for me when I'm here
[25:50] making decisions about what to sing I
[25:52] think well do we sing that course seven
[25:55] times but you know there's times when
[25:58] these songs get stuck in your head
[25:59] during the week and I don't mean that in
[26:01] a bad sort of way I mean that in a good
[26:03] sort of way it's a it's a blessing to
[26:06] have something of the Lord in our heads
[26:09] and in our minds that just you might say
[26:12] we go through life and an evil thought
[26:14] might want to Prevail upon us but isn't
[26:16] it wonderful when a a good thought a
[26:19] good song a good scripture is prevailing
[26:21] in our mind and we we can't even kind of
[26:24] control it almost and we almost could
[26:26] get maybe annoyed and it's just
[26:27] wonderful when it's a good thing amen
[26:30] it's it's obviously awful when it's a
[26:32] bad thing but I think sometimes the
[26:35] repetition is what just helps us to
[26:38] appreciate it more and more amen
[26:41] amen let's sing I am redeemed bought

[44:18] I I would also like to present the um
[44:23] bylaws the church bylaws to the church
[44:26] um and have you all number one review
[44:31] them pray over them and then if they
[44:35] would be acceptable to a majority of the
[44:38] people then ratify them also next Sunday
[44:42] morning so next Sunday morning at the
[44:44] Lord's
[44:45] willing we um have asked certain
[44:49] Brothers to pray about taking the
[44:51] offices that are in this church it's my
[44:55] understanding that this will probably be
[44:58] the first
[45:00] election that uh this church H has had
[45:04] as far as electing all of the offices in
[45:08] the church um it's much different now
[45:11] obviously I'm not the founding pastor of
[45:13] this church I am the pastor of this
[45:16] church but I'm not the founding Pastor
[45:18] so things are different and I'd like to
[45:20] handle things different than before and
[45:24] you can imagine if you start a church
[45:28] then this church grows up with your
[45:30] vision of this church but when someone
[45:33] else comes in and is elected it's a much
[45:37] different situation because we have a
[45:39] lot of lot of things that that we bring
[45:42] with us as far as our past and a lot of
[45:45] the ways that we have had Church before
[45:48] so it's it's a little bit I'm trying to
[45:50] navigate through those things and still
[45:52] trying to find the mind of the Lord on
[45:55] on these these things with the church um
[45:58] so I've
[45:59] asked um for deacons I don't want to
[46:03] fill all of the deacon roles I want to
[46:06] leave some of at least one of those
[46:08] positions of Deacon
[46:10] open um because there there are many
[46:14] qualified people I believe um but those
[46:18] deacons must be first
[46:20] tried and the Three Brothers that I've
[46:23] asked to come before the church and be
[46:26] voted on for deacons I believe have been
[46:29] tried and that is uh brother Lyall
[46:33] Johnson who has been with the Tucson
[46:38] Tabernacle for a long time everyone
[46:40] knows him brother Aaron Gara the same
[46:43] and I've asked brother Jordan Peterson
[46:47] to resign his position as a trustee and
[46:51] move into the position of
[46:54] Deacon um
[46:56] and then that also that leaves at least
[46:58] one position for the Deacon open uh as I
[47:01] said that there are I believe qualified
[47:03] brothers that could have that position I
[47:06] just in praying about it I felt to go
[47:10] the right now
[47:13] to go
[47:15] slow so with those
[47:17] Brothers next week and then for
[47:21] trustees there's a few positions that I
[47:24] want to leave open for the trustee but
[47:27] right now I would I've asked brother Ed
[47:30] dugall and brother Arie Peterson to
[47:33] continue on in those roles as trustee so
[47:37] those roles will also be coming before a
[47:40] vote next Sunday so please pray about
[47:43] these five brothers with um brother
[47:46] Jordan brother Lyall brother Aaron for
[47:49] deacons brother Ed and brother Arie as
[47:52] trustees as I said I would um
[47:56] I look forward to adding to those
[47:58] positions um in the future I also I know
[48:03] that the way that brother brandom set
[48:05] things forward that the
[48:07] pastor is the absolute in the church and
[48:10] and he's really if you look at brother
[48:12] brandom and what he said the Pastor is
[48:15] not necessarily to be voted on but I
[48:17] believe that we are a sovereign church I
[48:20] am the pastor of this church and it is
[48:23] my choice that I would also like to be
[48:25] voted Ved on Whenever there is an
[48:27] election for the offices in the church I
[48:31] also would like to come before the
[48:33] church and be voted on in the pastor
[48:35] position I think that's the right thing
[48:37] to do especially not being the founding
[48:39] Pastor I think it's respectful to
[48:41] especially those that have been in this
[48:43] church for so long so that's that's
[48:46] important to me that's the way we will
[48:47] move forward I will send out the details
[48:50] this week so please pray about
[48:53] that
[48:54] um and
[48:57] uh
[48:59] sometimes as I was going through the
[49:01] Book of Leviticus a few weeks ago there
[49:04] was something that really caught my
[49:07] eye and that was when the people and the
[49:12] priests were making an atonement for
[49:14] sin there were certain
[49:18] sins that required an
[49:21] atonement that the brother or the sister
[49:24] didn't know that they did now those when
[49:28] when they didn't know that they did it
[49:30] it doesn't make it not a sin it's still
[49:33] a sin but when that person became aware
[49:38] of their sin then they would offer an
[49:41] atonement for that and as I said just
[49:45] because we don't know it's a sin doesn't
[49:48] mean that we're not
[49:50] sinning so we need to be careful and
[49:52] always put things before the Lord in
[49:54] prayer and that's what I was talking
[49:55] talking about this morning about how
[49:57] important it is for us always to stay in
[49:59] prayer and stay in touch with the Lord
[50:01] and then when we receive that Holy
[50:03] Spirit into our lives there is a
[50:07] scripture that that says that we should
[50:11] pray always that we should always be in
[50:14] prayer and how can you do that we can't
[50:16] always be on our knees praying we can't
[50:18] always be standing at the altar praying
[50:21] but when you receive that Holy Spirit
[50:23] there is a communion between
[50:26] the the individual and God himself that
[50:29] is always going on it's all it's just
[50:32] constant back and forth communication so
[50:35] you can pray all the time and then when
[50:37] you go into a certain situation and that
[50:39] Holy Spirit might tell you you're
[50:41] wrong that's a sin and if you're in
[50:44] touch with that you can step back from
[50:47] that but many times and all of us do it
[50:50] we'll hear that still Small Voice and
[50:52] then we'll plow forward and that is a
[50:54] sin and that's that's why we make so
[50:56] many mistakes is because that human
[50:58] nature will overcome that Holy Spirit
[51:01] that's telling us so that's why it's
[51:03] important what I was talking about this
[51:04] morning always stay in prayer always put
[51:07] these things before the Lord and then
[51:10] the Lord will correct Us in Ezekiel I
[51:14] believe it is it talks
[51:17] about that God is I believe it's in
[51:20] Ezekiel he's addressing Ezekiel and he
[51:24] he says that you're a
[51:26] Watchman and he tells that prophet he
[51:28] says that if you tell the people that
[51:33] they are sinning and you point out this
[51:36] sin then you will not be
[51:39] responsible but if you see the sin going
[51:43] on and you don't point it
[51:47] out then Watchman you will be
[51:50] responsible along with the
[51:53] sinner so it shows how important this
[51:56] position in the Pulpit is and and I do
[52:00] take it very very seriously and I I'm
[52:04] trying and the same goes with this
[52:08] church election and moving forward I
[52:11] believe it's God's will that we have
[52:14] elected offices in the church brother
[52:18] brandom thought it important for his own
[52:21] church to have those elected offices and
[52:25] I look at the brandham Tabernacle or the
[52:27] way brother brandham set up and brother
[52:29] brandom's leadership many of these
[52:31] things are not in the Bible but I look
[52:34] at his leadership as the absolute on
[52:37] these things and say okay well that's
[52:40] that's the way that we will go about
[52:42] this now we are as I said we're a
[52:43] sovereign entity and brother Brandon
[52:45] would say that and he has said that each
[52:47] church is different and we are we are
[52:49] different than we have different
[52:51] problems and we different strengths than
[52:54] than the brandom Tabernacle Le would
[52:55] have had but I use that as an example in
[53:01] seeing that these elected
[53:05] offices I want to make sure that we do
[53:08] everything that we
[53:09] can in case God wants to bless us and
[53:13] God may be and I'm not saying he is but
[53:17] he may be holding back a blessing
[53:21] because there's little things that we
[53:23] haven't got done so this election is
[53:27] important and I I want to move forward
[53:30] with that so that that there's nothing
[53:32] that I can see Lord I'm doing everything
[53:34] that I can father and I'm I'm trying to
[53:37] move forward the way that you want us to
[53:39] move forward and I see that this is
[53:41] something we have to do I want to get
[53:42] this done the best that we know how and
[53:45] he knows he he he knows that we're
[53:48] children and he will guide
[53:51] us so and the same thing goes for this
[53:56] communion that we call communion that
[53:59] we're going to be taking tonight the
[54:01] Bible says to let a man examine himself
[54:06] doesn't say examine someone else it says
[54:10] let a man examine himself we have what's
[54:14] called an open communion here at the
[54:17] Tucson Tabernacle there will be
[54:20] different people that are at different
[54:23] stages in their walk with the Lord and
[54:26] we'll see them come up and we'll see
[54:28] that some people are at this Milestone
[54:32] other people are at this Milestone maybe
[54:35] some or over at this Milestone and we'll
[54:38] see that there are different Milestones
[54:40] being covered here but one thing that
[54:43] should be equal and that is all of our
[54:45] sincerity to serve the Lord whatever
[54:49] stage that we are at we should equally
[54:52] have a desire to serve God
[54:55] God and that's what I want to see in
[54:58] coming up to this communion table we
[55:01] should be sincere we should be deadly
[55:03] sincere because this is a very very
[55:06] important thing that that we are going
[55:09] to do because the Bible says and I'll
[55:13] read it
[55:14] tonight it says if you take the body and
[55:19] the blood of Jesus Christ
[55:22] unworthy you are guilty of his body same
[55:27] thing as being the murderer of Jesus
[55:29] Christ you are guilty of that so as
[55:32] you're thinking on these things today
[55:34] and as I'm reading these scriptures
[55:36] remember that if you are up here taking
[55:39] this
[55:41] unworthy that if your sins are
[55:44] unconfessed and not under the blood of
[55:47] Jesus Christ you are guilty of that body
[55:50] but then there is another side to this
[55:53] and that other side is if you don't
[55:57] take this
[55:59] communion Jesus said in in feet washing
[56:02] with Peter Peter said you're not gonna
[56:04] we're not going to do this Peter says
[56:06] Jesus says listen if you don't do this
[56:09] you have no part with me that's how
[56:13] important these ordinances are feet
[56:16] washing taking the bread and taking the
[56:18] wine so if you have sin unconfessed sin
[56:22] in your life that you haven't brought
[56:24] before the Lord Jesus you haven't
[56:25] repented and you haven't made that
[56:28] commitment Lord I'm going to make this
[56:31] right then you shouldn't be up here and
[56:34] then on the other
[56:36] side you should be up here taking this
[56:40] because that means you will have a part
[56:42] in Christ that means you're a Christian
[56:45] when I say open
[56:47] communion I don't believe I believe it's
[56:50] a
[56:51] Catholic practice to refuse someone Comm
[56:55] communion I believe that
[56:58] because a man whether it be a priest a
[57:02] pastor a CL clergy or whatever it is has
[57:05] no right to say that you cannot partake
[57:10] in the body and the blood of Jesus
[57:12] Christ like the Catholics do I don't
[57:14] believe that is right I don't believe
[57:16] that it's scriptural but I do believe it
[57:19] is up to the Watchmen here to warn the
[57:22] congregation if you come up here
[57:26] unworthily there is a problem in your
[57:28] life whether you
[57:30] have sin a secret
[57:35] sin that you should go before the
[57:38] Lord Lord I'm not going to do it anymore
[57:42] Lord I'm Gonna Change secret before the
[57:46] Lord or if you have a problem with
[57:49] somebody
[57:50] else you need to make sure that that
[57:53] problem is
[57:55] fixed or else you're coming again
[58:00] unworthy these things
[58:04] are part of the design I think from God
[58:08] is to make sure that we're always
[58:09] checking
[58:10] ourselves that that we're not sinning
[58:13] because he says basically if you do over
[58:16] here you're wrong if you do over here
[58:18] you're
[58:19] wrong the best thing is just to get sin
[58:21] out of our Lives best to get all that
[58:24] odd out of I the best is just to do our
[58:27] best to serve Jesus Christ the best that
[58:30] we know how move forward confess sin say
[58:35] Lord I'm sorry I was wrong if I did
[58:37] somebody else wrong you have to go to
[58:39] that person and make it right now if
[58:43] there's something that comes to your
[58:44] mind maybe tonight
[58:48] that I didn't do Lord I should have made
[58:51] this right you can make that commitment
[58:54] here and you can make that commitment
[58:57] before the Lord and
[58:59] then you're you're right the Lord knows
[59:02] he knows you're going to do it you can
[59:03] take that communion and then make sure
[59:05] you get to that person and then you make
[59:07] that right because if you don't then you
[59:10] just sinned when you came up here
[59:12] example Stephanie and I we um we're
[59:16] building a house in Jeffersonville years
[59:18] ago and we got ripped off by the um
[59:25] granite company that made the like
[59:27] granite
[59:28] countertops and what happened was they
[59:30] they told us that it's going to be this
[59:33] much and so we said okay good this is a
[59:36] little bit less than all the other bids
[59:38] that we got let's go ahead and let's do
[59:40] it and then they came back when we had
[59:44] to pay the bill and it was significantly
[59:47] thousands of dollars higher so what did
[59:52] I
[59:53] do I said said I'm not paying it I'm not
[59:57] doing it and they said well look you
[1:00:00] signed over here we had a meeting a few
[1:00:02] weeks ago which they just slipped in
[1:00:04] this paper they said you sign this so
[1:00:06] you're you're liable for this I said I'm
[1:00:08] not doing it and I wrote them a check
[1:00:11] for the original
[1:00:13] amount and that was it that was it for
[1:00:15] the Granite Company we got our granite
[1:00:18] and it always bothered
[1:00:20] me year after year that bothered me
[1:00:24] because I I was right I was right they
[1:00:29] tried to rip me off man that this was
[1:00:31] wrong so but it always bothered me I
[1:00:34] never told Stephanie about it but I
[1:00:37] always
[1:00:39] thought maybe I didn't do right so one
[1:00:44] morning Stephanie I are up early is like
[1:00:47] a Saturday or
[1:00:49] Friday and we're sitting in bed and I'm
[1:00:53] drinking my coffee coffee and this is
[1:00:56] years how many years later honey five
[1:00:58] six seven years significant right there
[1:01:02] many years
[1:01:04] later we're drinking our coffee i' never
[1:01:06] mentioned it to my wife we're drinking
[1:01:08] our
[1:01:10] coffee and Stephanie says she says you
[1:01:13] remember that Granite
[1:01:16] Company and I was thinking about
[1:01:20] it I was
[1:01:21] like yeah
[1:01:26] she said something on the order of you
[1:01:29] know I never felt right about
[1:01:31] that and I said I didn't either anyone
[1:01:34] so what I did we didn't have we didn't
[1:01:37] have any money we were just really
[1:01:39] struggling the Lord provided for us but
[1:01:42] but we really struggled to make ends
[1:01:45] meet what we did is we went into our
[1:01:48] home equity line of credit wrote a check
[1:01:52] brought it down to the Granite Company
[1:01:54] well what I did was is I contacted the
[1:01:56] granite company and I said here's the
[1:02:00] deal we never resolve this years and
[1:02:03] years and years ago same
[1:02:06] salesperson we didn't resolve this years
[1:02:08] and years and years
[1:02:10] ago um I think we owe you $5,000 or
[1:02:14] $3,000 or whatever it was um we didn't
[1:02:18] come to an agreement what will you
[1:02:21] settle
[1:02:23] for she said the full
[1:02:27] amount did not didn't give us a break at
[1:02:31] all it's like hey I'm being a CR I'm
[1:02:33] being nice you know you know they don't
[1:02:34] want to have a testimony say oh well
[1:02:35] they came back and said I have to pay
[1:02:37] anything and everybody was good and
[1:02:38] smile and handshake she said every
[1:02:41] single
[1:02:42] penny so we wrote a check for the
[1:02:46] thousands of dollars of difference that
[1:02:47] it was even though we didn't have a have
[1:02:50] the money and we made it
[1:02:52] right I don't want that
[1:02:55] to be something that keeps me from this
[1:02:57] communion table or keeps me out of
[1:02:59] heaven so if you have something like
[1:03:02] that I'm not telling you to go pay
[1:03:03] somebody that ripped you off but if
[1:03:05] there is something in your if there is
[1:03:09] something in your life we were we were
[1:03:13] by for some reason we were I was wrong
[1:03:17] in that and God didn't like the way I
[1:03:20] handled it so I had to make that right
[1:03:23] and if there's something in your life
[1:03:26] that you need to make right I would
[1:03:28] recommend that you do it or make the
[1:03:30] commitment to do
[1:03:33] it in this communion as I was talking
[1:03:37] about this
[1:03:40] morning
[1:03:42] God just like all of the parents here
[1:03:45] don't you just love
[1:03:47] it when you see your kids and and
[1:03:50] they're together and they're getting
[1:03:52] along and
[1:03:54] and they're having fun and they're
[1:03:56] playing don't you love it when that
[1:03:58] happens doesn't that feel good for a
[1:04:00] parent to have that I mean usually when
[1:04:03] our kids were growing up it was great
[1:04:05] when our kids were learning their
[1:04:07] instruments we're like oh this is great
[1:04:09] you have meline on the mandolin and
[1:04:10] Daniel's over there on the guitar and
[1:04:13] and things would go well and then after
[1:04:15] a while man they started
[1:04:18] fighting and mine would be like Daddy
[1:04:21] he's not playing it right and and Daniel
[1:04:23] would be like I'm going to play the way
[1:04:24] I want to play and they they're there
[1:04:26] and they're playing gospel music
[1:04:28] fighting and squabbling and it didn't
[1:04:32] make me feel good as a
[1:04:34] dad but when we see our children getting
[1:04:38] along working together loving each other
[1:04:43] that is what a true father and a true
[1:04:47] mother wants and that's what he wants
[1:04:50] our heavenly father wants with this
[1:04:53] communion he wants us together he wants
[1:04:56] us looking out for each other loving one
[1:05:00] another in the Book of John the Gospel
[1:05:05] of John things were starting to lead up
[1:05:10] to the crucifixion of Christ in John
[1:05:13] chapter 10 Jesus is talking
[1:05:17] about The Shepherd of the sheep and he
[1:05:21] says this John chap 10:14 he says says I
[1:05:24] am the Good
[1:05:27] Shepherd and know my sheep and have
[1:05:30] known and am known of
[1:05:33] mine he says as the father knoweth
[1:05:38] me even so I know the father and I lay
[1:05:42] down my life for the Sheep that's a true
[1:05:46] Shepherd laying down his life for these
[1:05:49] sheep and other sheep listen to this now
[1:05:53] Jesus is here and he's talking talking
[1:05:54] to his people and he says this and other
[1:05:56] sheep I have which are not of this
[1:06:00] fold them also I must
[1:06:05] bring outside of what we might
[1:06:09] consider Believers or outside of what we
[1:06:12] would consider in our little box someone
[1:06:15] that we may never even think
[1:06:19] of them also I must bring and they shall
[1:06:23] hear hear my
[1:06:26] voice not the pastor's voice not
[1:06:30] necessarily your Church's voice but the
[1:06:33] voice of Jesus Christ
[1:06:36] himself and they shall hear my voice and
[1:06:39] there shall be
[1:06:42] onefold and one Shepherd as far as unity
[1:06:47] in the
[1:06:48] Bible I don't know a more powerful
[1:06:51] statement than Jesus said right there
[1:06:54] that there shall be one fold and one
[1:06:56] Shepherd do you think he likes looking
[1:06:59] down and seeing all of the Catholics and
[1:07:03] the methodists and all of us and all of
[1:07:05] the different ones thinking that they're
[1:07:07] better than one another and here is God
[1:07:09] loving them all and saying you know I
[1:07:12] told you not to fight and I told you
[1:07:16] when I return that I'm going to know you
[1:07:17] by your love one for
[1:07:20] another therefore doth my father love me
[1:07:24] because I lay down my life that I might
[1:07:26] take it again no man taketh it from me
[1:07:29] but I lay down of myself I have power to
[1:07:33] lay it down and I have power to take it
[1:07:39] again this commandment I have received
[1:07:42] of my father who could say such
[1:07:48] words I have power to lay my life down
[1:07:51] any of us could lay our lives down
[1:07:55] any of us could take our own lives or
[1:07:57] give our lives for someone else but
[1:07:59] which one of us could say I can take my
[1:08:02] life and bring it back up that's only
[1:08:05] one that's God in flesh Jesus
[1:08:08] Christ so in
[1:08:11] preparing Jesus was talking he started
[1:08:14] really moving toward toward preaching
[1:08:17] unity and preaching love and as this day
[1:08:22] approached this day of of
[1:08:25] um this feast day this Passover feast as
[1:08:30] it approached more and more Jesus
[1:08:34] started to preach on these
[1:08:37] things and then the time had come that
[1:08:42] they needed to find a place to eat this
[1:08:45] last supper let's go to Matthew chapter
[1:08:48] 26:1 17 says this now the first day of
[1:08:52] the Feast of unleavened bread the
[1:08:54] disciples came to Jesus saying unto him
[1:08:57] where wilt thou that we prepare for for
[1:09:00] thee to eat the Passover and he said go
[1:09:03] into the city to such a man and say unto
[1:09:07] him the master saith my time is at hand
[1:09:10] I will keep the Passover at thy house
[1:09:12] with my disciples in other words Jesus
[1:09:15] is telling the messenger go and tell
[1:09:17] this certain man that the teacher says
[1:09:20] my time to suffer the atonement of sin
[1:09:24] is at
[1:09:26] hand I wonder what that messenger
[1:09:30] thought when Jesus sent him out who
[1:09:32] knows which disciple it was or who
[1:09:34] whoever um he sent out but when he went
[1:09:38] to this man and they reserved this upper
[1:09:41] room area that they could have dinner
[1:09:43] have
[1:09:44] supper I wonder what he was thinking
[1:09:46] that the master said that my time is at
[1:09:50] hand over and over and over Jesus
[1:09:53] started starts prophesying of his
[1:09:56] death and the disciples did as Jesus had
[1:09:59] appointed them and they made ready the
[1:10:01] Passover now when the even was come he
[1:10:04] sat down with the 12 so now they sit
[1:10:08] down at
[1:10:10] supper and Jesus they they have the the
[1:10:14] unleavened bread and they have the wine
[1:10:17] there and then let's let's move over to
[1:10:21] John Chapter 13 we'll start with verse
[1:10:24] 31
[1:10:26] that Jesus was they were eating at the
[1:10:29] table and Jesus tells the disciples he
[1:10:32] says one of you is going to betray me
[1:10:35] and the disciples all started getting
[1:10:37] nervous like who's who's it gonna be and
[1:10:40] then
[1:10:41] finally Jesus sends Judas out to go do
[1:10:47] what he has to
[1:10:48] do and that was sending Judas out to
[1:10:51] betray Jesus and now he just just has
[1:10:55] his other disciples
[1:10:58] there John 13:31 says therefore when he
[1:11:02] was gone out speaking Judas left Jesus
[1:11:05] says now is the son of man
[1:11:07] glorified and God is glorified in him
[1:11:10] now they're sitting around the supper
[1:11:12] table and they're
[1:11:13] talking if God be glorified in him God
[1:11:16] shall also glorify him in himself and
[1:11:18] shall straightway glorify him little
[1:11:21] children yet a little while I am with
[1:11:24] you you shall seek me and as I said unto
[1:11:27] the Jews whether I go you cannot come
[1:11:30] now I say it to you just my little group
[1:11:33] here a new commandment I give unto you
[1:11:36] that you love one another this is going
[1:11:40] to be a common theme in this last supper
[1:11:43] that you love one
[1:11:45] another as I have loved you that ye also
[1:11:48] love one another look at he repeated it
[1:11:50] twice in the same
[1:11:51] sentence by this shall all oh men know
[1:11:54] that you are my my disciples if you have
[1:11:57] love one for another here's the master
[1:12:02] he's got his few Little Disciples around
[1:12:05] here and he keeps telling them the same
[1:12:07] thing repeating
[1:12:09] himself John
[1:12:12] 1412 says this verily verily I say unto
[1:12:16] you he that believeth on me the works
[1:12:19] that I do shall he do also and Greater
[1:12:21] Works than these shall he do because I
[1:12:23] go unto my father and whatsoever you
[1:12:26] shall ask in my name that will I do that
[1:12:28] the father may be glorified in the
[1:12:31] son if you shall ask anything in my name
[1:12:34] I will do
[1:12:36] it if you love me keep my
[1:12:40] Commandments it's very important also
[1:12:44] that if we say we love
[1:12:47] Jesus then there is something that we
[1:12:49] have to do also and that is to do what
[1:12:52] he said to do to follow his
[1:12:57] teaching and I will pray the father and
[1:13:01] he shall give you another comforter that
[1:13:03] he may abide with you forever even the
[1:13:05] spirit of Truth whom the world cannot
[1:13:07] receive because it seeth him
[1:13:10] not neither knoweth him but you know him
[1:13:15] for he dwelleth with you
[1:13:18] now there is talking to
[1:13:22] them and end shall be in
[1:13:27] you what a what a promise that he says
[1:13:30] there he says that basically that I'm
[1:13:35] here with you that that this Spirit of
[1:13:38] Truth this holy spirit is in flesh right
[1:13:40] now it's with you and here's the good
[1:13:43] here's the thing this is going to get a
[1:13:46] lot better it's going to be in
[1:13:51] you I will not leave you comfortless
[1:13:54] he's giving them comfort for something
[1:13:56] that they don't even know that's going
[1:13:57] to happen
[1:13:59] yet I I will not leave you comfortless I
[1:14:02] will come to you yet a little while and
[1:14:04] the world seeth me no more but ye shall
[1:14:07] see me because I live ye shall live
[1:14:10] also and that day you shall know that I
[1:14:13] am in my father and ye in me and I in
[1:14:15] you it's very very close relationship
[1:14:19] our lord Jesus is prophesying that he is
[1:14:21] going to have with these disciples
[1:14:24] he that hath my Commandments and keepeth
[1:14:28] them he it is that loveth me again he's
[1:14:33] saying do what I
[1:14:35] say and he that loveth me shall be loved
[1:14:38] of my father and I will love him and
[1:14:41] will manifest myself to him Judas Judas
[1:14:46] saith unto him not his carrot Lord how
[1:14:51] is it that thou Willl manifest manifest
[1:14:53] thyself to us and not unto the world and
[1:14:55] Jesus answered and said unto him if a
[1:14:58] man love me he will keep my words and my
[1:15:03] father will love
[1:15:05] him and we will come unto him and make
[1:15:10] our Abode with
[1:15:13] him again
[1:15:15] prophesying of this holy spirit that is
[1:15:18] going to come and take up dwelling in
[1:15:21] these vessels in this Temple room
[1:15:23] remember they used to worship in the
[1:15:25] temple and this Temple it was it wasn't
[1:15:29] brother Paul it it wasn't the ultimate
[1:15:32] thing the temple represented something
[1:15:35] that was going to happen remember
[1:15:36] Solomon built this Temple and the Holy
[1:15:38] Spirit came down Moses built the
[1:15:41] Tabernacle and the Holy Spirit came down
[1:15:43] the pillar of fire came down the same
[1:15:45] thing happened when they built that uh
[1:15:47] the the structure there in Jerusalem
[1:15:50] Solomon's Temple but that was just
[1:15:53] representative of what would one day
[1:15:56] happen which is that same Pillar of Fire
[1:15:59] that same Holy Spirit would come into a
[1:16:03] body these
[1:16:05] bodies not a building built with
[1:16:09] hands but the but the Temple of our
[1:16:13] bodies he that loveth
[1:16:16] me keepeth not he that loveth me not
[1:16:18] keepeth not my sayings and the word
[1:16:20] which you hear is not mine but the
[1:16:22] father which sent
[1:16:24] me again Jesus
[1:16:27] expects us to live by this
[1:16:31] Bible if you love
[1:16:34] me do what this word
[1:16:38] says he goes so far as to say if you
[1:16:41] don't follow my Commandments then you
[1:16:43] don't love
[1:16:45] me what happens what really is I'll put
[1:16:47] it in simple terms is you love the world
[1:16:49] more than you love
[1:16:51] God you'll love that sin more than you
[1:16:55] love God all of us whether it be
[1:16:58] gossiping whether it be lying whether it
[1:17:00] be dirt whether it be more filthy sin
[1:17:04] sleeping around or or partying or
[1:17:07] whatever it is when we do
[1:17:11] that we put that higher than we put God
[1:17:15] it's a strange thing but we do
[1:17:17] it these things have I spoken to you
[1:17:21] being yet present with you but the
[1:17:23] comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom
[1:17:26] the father will send in my name he shall
[1:17:28] teach you all things and bring all
[1:17:30] things to your remembrance what
[1:17:32] whatsoever I have said unto
[1:17:36] you I quoted first Thessalonians I got a
[1:17:39] coffee cup that uh has first
[1:17:42] Thessalonians on there and it says this
[1:17:44] it says 1 Thessalonians 5:16 Rejoice
[1:17:47] Evermore pray without ceasing in
[1:17:49] everything give thanks for this is the
[1:17:51] will of God in Christ Jesus concerning
[1:17:54] you as I said before how can we pray
[1:17:57] without ceasing well that Holy Spirit is
[1:17:58] inside of us and we're constantly
[1:18:01] communing with that Holy
[1:18:04] Spirit peace I leave with you my peace I
[1:18:09] give unto you not as the world giveth
[1:18:12] give I unto you let not your heart be
[1:18:14] heart be troubled neither Let It Be
[1:18:19] Afraid uh they probably have no idea
[1:18:23] what's going on here they can probably
[1:18:24] see the concern upon the Lord Jesus
[1:18:28] there because Jesus knew what was about
[1:18:30] to happen and he's comforting
[1:18:34] them he's not saying Pat me on the back
[1:18:38] he's saying listen I'm
[1:18:41] leaving and he's about to suffer more
[1:18:43] than anyone has ever suffered in the
[1:18:45] history of the
[1:18:46] world but I want to leave you some
[1:18:49] instructions love one
[1:18:51] another receive
[1:18:53] me into your
[1:18:56] soul you have heard how I said unto you
[1:19:00] I go away and come again if you loved me
[1:19:04] you would Rejoice because I say I go to
[1:19:07] the I go unto the father for my father
[1:19:10] is greater than I and now I have told
[1:19:13] you before it come to pass that when it
[1:19:16] has come to pass ye might
[1:19:18] believe Hereafter I will not talk much
[1:19:21] with you for the prince of this world
[1:19:22] World cometh we know who that is right
[1:19:25] at this time that he was saying this
[1:19:27] Judas is Carrot is making a deal over
[1:19:31] here with the
[1:19:32] priests to take Jesus to his
[1:19:37] death for the prince of this world
[1:19:39] cometh and have nothing in
[1:19:41] me but that the world may know that I
[1:19:45] love the father and as the father gave
[1:19:47] me commandment even so do I arise and
[1:19:51] let us go hence
[1:19:54] now all of this there's a few
[1:19:57] chapters that are
[1:20:00] discussion around this supper table that
[1:20:04] we are going to take
[1:20:05] tonight this is this communion table the
[1:20:09] first time that this happened Jesus is
[1:20:12] there and he's giving all of these
[1:20:16] promises and they're doing the same
[1:20:18] thing that we're about to
[1:20:20] do Jesus said here this is my
[1:20:24] body this is my
[1:20:27] blood take this in
[1:20:30] remembrance of me remember me while
[1:20:34] you're doing this and he gives the
[1:20:38] promise over and over again of the holy
[1:20:40] spirit this comforter he gives this
[1:20:42] promise that this holy spirit that I
[1:20:45] have to go and you're going to be really
[1:20:48] sad and you're going to be really
[1:20:51] scared remember my words they comfort
[1:20:53] you but I am leaving and it's going to
[1:20:56] work out for your
[1:20:58] benefit and thank God that he he
[1:21:02] left because then he came
[1:21:05] back as a
[1:21:08] spirit inside of us in another Upper
[1:21:11] Room at the day of Pentecost what a
[1:21:15] beautiful story this story of Jesus
[1:21:20] Christ talking to his Bel beloved
[1:21:23] disciples making them promises and
[1:21:25] saying I'm going to be closer to you
[1:21:27] than you ever
[1:21:29] imagined and he says let you should be
[1:21:33] happy and they had no idea then a few
[1:21:37] hours later Jesus would be taken and
[1:21:40] they would be scared to death and they
[1:21:43] would all run
[1:21:44] away but these words I guarantee you
[1:21:47] that he spoke to them around this supper
[1:21:50] table rang in their mind
[1:21:53] and then he says at that last verse he
[1:21:56] says arise and let us go hence they're
[1:21:59] all sitting at the table and he says all
[1:22:02] right let's get
[1:22:03] up and I believe it was in Matthew maybe
[1:22:06] in John I think it was in Matthew that
[1:22:07] they sang A
[1:22:08] Hymn and then they left and then they
[1:22:11] started down the
[1:22:13] mountain on the way to to the Garden of
[1:22:16] Gethsemane we know what happened there
[1:22:18] but all of this that he talked about was
[1:22:21] all around the supper table
[1:22:23] all around where we are going to take
[1:22:25] these ordinances and the theme was love
[1:22:29] one
[1:22:30] another forgive one another go to battle
[1:22:34] for one another pray for one another and
[1:22:36] you look at and you look at all the
[1:22:38] disciples when they wrote their letters
[1:22:40] the ones that were sitting at the
[1:22:42] sitting at the table at the communion
[1:22:43] table what did they all teach taught it
[1:22:46] this morning James love one another pray
[1:22:49] for one another lay hands on one another
[1:22:53] when
[1:22:54] John the APO the the Beloved disciple he
[1:22:57] says God is
[1:22:59] love and he said little little children
[1:23:02] love one
[1:23:03] another Peter all of them that were
[1:23:07] there the most important thing to them
[1:23:09] was
[1:23:10] love and it was all around this
[1:23:13] table and that's when we take these
[1:23:17] ordinances
[1:23:19] tonight and we'll get started right now
[1:23:24] when we take these
[1:23:26] ordinances think about what Jesus what I
[1:23:30] was just reading that Jesus taught at
[1:23:32] the
[1:23:33] original Last
[1:23:35] Supper and what we're doing tonight is
[1:23:37] we are reenacting that brother Lyall you
[1:23:40] we have all of the um the feast days and
[1:23:43] all of that every single feast day and
[1:23:44] every single holiday that they had was
[1:23:46] in commemoration of something that God
[1:23:48] had
[1:23:49] done and what they do is they tell the
[1:23:51] story and they Rel live it we can apply
[1:23:53] the same to Christmas we talk about the
[1:23:55] birth of Christ and we talk about the
[1:23:57] Star of David and we talk about all all
[1:23:59] of the wisen and all that what we're
[1:24:01] doing is we're commemorating that just
[1:24:03] as they did on these feast days and here
[1:24:06] we have what is
[1:24:08] probably the most
[1:24:10] important of them and that is this
[1:24:14] communion where we are actually
[1:24:18] taking what represents the body and the
[1:24:22] blood of our Lord and savior just
[1:24:25] exactly as they did on that day 2,000
[1:24:28] years ago it's a great
[1:24:29] honor I hope
[1:24:32] everyone is
[1:24:34] able to take this body but I would warn
[1:24:38] you and I believe God will God will
[1:24:41] honor it if you are not worthy if you
[1:24:44] feel that you have something in your
[1:24:46] life and you don't take it I believe
[1:24:47] that God will honor that also I believe
[1:24:50] that with all my heart this is in an
[1:24:52] individual Affair as I said we have an
[1:24:56] open communion there will be people
[1:24:59] coming here that are at different stages
[1:25:04] in their Christian walk but none should
[1:25:08] be any more sincere than anyone else as
[1:25:12] far as their their desire to serve the
[1:25:14] Lord is that
[1:25:18] clear if the brothers would come
[1:25:21] forward 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:25:25] 11 I'll
[1:25:27] read verse 23 through
[1:25:30] 32 this is the Apostle
[1:25:35] Paul the Apostle Paul obviously wasn't
[1:25:38] there at that day but a minister of the
[1:25:42] Gospel what he was doing was he was
[1:25:44] saying here is what import is
[1:25:47] important for I have received of the
[1:25:50] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[1:25:53] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[1:25:56] in which he was betrayed took
[1:25:58] bread and when he had given
[1:26:02] thanks remember all the disciples around
[1:26:05] the table when he had given thanks he
[1:26:07] break it and he said take eat this is my
[1:26:12] body which is broken for you do this in
[1:26:14] remembrance of me and after the same
[1:26:17] manner also he took the cup and when he
[1:26:21] had SED saying this cup is the New
[1:26:25] Testament in my blood do this do this do
[1:26:30] ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance
[1:26:33] of
[1:26:34] me for as often as you eat this bread
[1:26:37] and drink this cup you do show the
[1:26:39] Lord's death till he
[1:26:41] come wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[1:26:44] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:26:47] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:26:51] and blood of the
[1:26:53] Lord very serious statement who was
[1:26:55] guilty of the body and blood of the Lord
[1:26:58] his name is Judas is
[1:27:00] Carrot but let a man examine himself and
[1:27:04] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[1:27:06] of that cup for he that eateth and
[1:27:08] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[1:27:11] Damnation to himself not Discerning the
[1:27:13] Lord's
[1:27:14] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:27:18] sickly among you and many
[1:27:21] sleep
[1:27:22] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:27:24] should not be judged but when we are
[1:27:27] judged we are chastened of the Lord that
[1:27:30] we should not be condemned with the
[1:27:33] world we need our our musicians to come
[1:27:36] forward
[1:27:39] also
[1:27:41] so the next
[1:27:43] step is
[1:27:46] Jesus prayed over the bread and he
[1:27:50] prayed over the wine and then it was
[1:27:52] broken and given to the people so
[1:27:56] Brothers if we could come
[1:27:59] forward this is the the wine pray over

[1:41:38] day and supper being
[1:41:40] ended the devil having now put into the
[1:41:43] heart of judas's carrot Simon's son to
[1:41:45] betray him Jesus knowing that the father
[1:41:48] had given all things into his hands
[1:41:51] and that he was come from God and went
[1:41:54] to God he riseth up riseth from supper
[1:41:58] and laid aside his garments and took a
[1:42:00] towel and GED himself after that he
[1:42:04] poured porth water into a basin and
[1:42:07] began to wash the disciples feet and to
[1:42:10] wipe them with the towel wherewith he
[1:42:12] was GED then cometh he to Simon Peter
[1:42:16] and Peter saith unto him Lord Dost thou
[1:42:18] wash my feet and Peter answered and
[1:42:22] Jesus answered and said unto him what I
[1:42:25] do thou knowest now not know not now but
[1:42:30] Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter saith
[1:42:33] unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet
[1:42:36] Jesus answered him if I wash thee not
[1:42:41] thou Hast no part with
[1:42:42] me Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not
[1:42:47] my feet only but also my hands and my
[1:42:49] head Jesus saith un saith to him he that
[1:42:54] is washed needeth not save to wash his
[1:42:58] feet but is clean every wit and ye are
[1:43:01] clean but not all for he knew who should
[1:43:04] betray
[1:43:06] him therefore said he ye are not all
[1:43:10] clean so after he had washed their feet
[1:43:14] and had taken his garments and was set
[1:43:16] down again he said unto them know ye
[1:43:20] what I have done done to you you call me

[1:44:21] and that one day that that Spirit would
