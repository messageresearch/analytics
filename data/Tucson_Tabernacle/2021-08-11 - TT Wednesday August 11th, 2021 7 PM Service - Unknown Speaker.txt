youngest of four he's 62 and his older brothers and sisters and all of them are quite sick and they put his oldest sister fran in uh [Music] what he called a hospice with she was no longer responding to lady gibber anytime really so he had taken yesterday off to take dad to see her and spent some time but he's always mentioned it to me says because i know your church prays so and i believe we're not here for ourselves we're here for others because it's not something you just say it's all for me but it should be flowing rivers of living water should be flowing for others to receive and and so i we take the time and we ask them when i hear i just say so what can you tell me what can you say and and i know that they were raised christian and he knows that there is a god so we would we would believe that we would pray for him so if you'll stand with me [Music] before we start let's just just bow our heads and we'll include these in prayer and just believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever so lord jesus as we bow our heads first we want to say thank you lord for your mercy and your grace thank you for providing for all the needs that we have lord and there's nothing that's not covered lord in that word salvation both healing of the soul and healing of the body lord healing of the mind lord our the ones that we have and sometimes the hurts that are deep lord but it'll penetrate into that lord and set free and and bring joy and peace lord as we sing that song peace of god cover me lord we'll look into that you've heard these requests you know every heart and every desire here lord that you would be mindful lord and just begin to touch our sister bethany lord that cold just clear away from her body lord and every desire for every need and every hand raised lord we just ask you that you would have your own way in jesus christ's name amen amen have you been to jesus amen are you washed in the blood of the lamb i changed the pace just a little bit have you [Music] been to jesus [Music] you [Music] are you washed in the blood of the lamb [Music] are you is [Music] ready for the mansion [Music] is [Applause] [Music] and be washed in there's a fountain yes [Music] oh it shouldn't be a question so much as it should be a revelation in your heart yes amen you may be seated we have [Music] sister angela back on the clarinet [Applause] i was going to ask for a clarinet solo but good to have your back so i appreciate god's mercy and grace so nothing but the blood nothing but the blood i appreciated brother peter's ministering on sunday night about the the only way the only true worship that is accepted and it's through the shed blood what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of jesus what can wash away my [Music] nothing but the blood of jesus precious [Music] i know nothing but nothing but the blood of jesus oh [Music] that i [Music] and this is [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] my [Music] is [Music] nothing but the blood of jesus [Music] amen you could work hard for good works and there's nothing wrong about being kind and loving and all that should be the attribute but when you try to put that and present it to god it doesn't mean anything no it's been the precious blood of jesus brother tim was that a praise that you put up there you want to say it from there loudly so we can hear you i praise god amen so prayer changes things amen that's a thing so amen that god should love a sinner such as i just sometimes you get to looking at yourself and you say why would he love me but don't question them accept it i always said that it's hard to receive a gift without thinking you owe something back a gift is a gift but when somebody gives you a gift you automatically now i got to give them something back but he loved us i like the way brother green said it showed it one day and he explained it this way and he said god loved you perfectly holy completely he said you can't make him love you more because he's loved you fully and you can't make him love you less because he loves you fully so he said what can i do i can love him more i can appreciate him that god [Music] [Applause] how wonderful is such [Applause] [Music] is is [Music] is uh [Music] if love such [Music] is [Music] he asks me open on his arms [Music] amen amen [Music] you're probably wondering why the preacher's sitting in the front row today why are you sitting there with a lot now yesterday probably mid-morning or so it just felt my heart to call brother lyle [Music] i said she'd call him and make sure everything's ready everything's going put it off kept working a little later i said call him i'd put it off some more and it was late afternoon early evening finally called him i said brother lyle how's things going and i could hear in his voice kind of like um i said well i just felt my heart to tell you if sunday would be better you think would be more comfortable for you that would be all right and he said i just i know i have the thought i just can't get it out so thank you very much brother and sometimes it is like that you know the thoughts you're doing but trying to to fill the young shinto so tonight we're going to listen to a message called the perfection preaching 57 and i was looking at another tape and i saw this when i just started listening to it this afternoon i said oh my goodness ties in perfectly with what brother peter was speaking on on sunday evening but it's the crucifixion he calls it the perfection and it's such love it's what it comes down to it's god's perfect love so it's about 70 minutes long and we'll listen to that but let's just sing one more song before before we go into i can't quite see the clock and i thought it was later in that but that's not quite so i was just thinking about that song when he reached down his hand for me when you realize how much he's done for you and what it took for him to stoop down to as low as i was and said i'll go down and rescue maybe some of you he didn't have to go down so far but for some of us he had to go all the way down and i appreciate that [Music] and was wretched [Music] gave me peace [Music] when he reached down his hand for me i was lost [Music] god [Music] i was [Music] that i could [Music] [Applause] [Music] let's sing the next verse before the course [Music] from [Music] is [Music] when i was lost [Music] one more time [Music] is when [Music] i was lost [Music] you reach your hand up for him but that's because he reached for you you know it's sometimes hard to understand you you might feel i've i made this a temple but he had to draw him because the scripture tells no man coming to the father but by me his draws how many appreciate that as we get ready to to hear this the perfection let's let's stand sing only believe brother branham said the angel of the lord told him how that song please the lord he said if you get the people to believe and and sometimes we say lord i believe but help now my unbelief there's times as a human you get weak you get frustrated you look at something driving down the road today and the company truck is monitored for speed they sent me the report of my driving one time they're like wow it's a whole lot more than i thought how many times i break too hard how many times i took a curve too long how many times i was speeding different things like that and i said if they can do that with a module in the in the in the computer of the truck what can god watch and see so i was going down the road obeying the speed limit not because i wanted to quote unquote okay just be honest but because i knew i'd get in trouble if i didn't so there was this guy and he was just antsy behind me coming down tangerine road and he finally passed me up he i was doing 50 the speed limit and in a minute he was gone and this christian brother was thinking i hope there's a police down there to pull him over right now about halfway down i said but that's not the attitude just because i'm obeying the speed limit and he doesn't want to why should i be critical of him and lord you know i'm only obeying it because i have to so lord have mercy on me too i like the way god teaches us lessons at science and just simple enough to make us understand and i appreciate that let's sing that verse only beliefs [Music] are possible [Music] all things are possible [Music] now lord i believe oh lord i believe lord i all believe are possible [Music] lord i believe lord i believe all things [Music] lord bless you may be seated [Music] i have my quick friend here on the platform tonight dr lee baby first baptist church at lyme ohio who was one of my sponsors at the live meeting i asked him coming down tonight if he would just say a word to the congregation maybe pertaining to the lyman meeting for the next moment or two and i'm glad to happily introduce you tonight dr lee vale another baptist that's got the holy ghost god bless you thank you that was all pretty strong for a baptist pastor wasn't it well we're very happy to have brother bail with us and certainly the doors are open for him to come back and visit us at any time he can and now tonight tomorrow night is the uh the entombment of the lord jesus sunday morning is the six o'clock sunrise service and i believe the brother has announced the further part of the service now let us pray just a moment blessed lord thy word is truth amen and we're thankful for men who handle it fearless as they give it out to the people and as we open up the bible tonight or turn back its pages may the blessed holy ghost come and open the word of understanding to us through jesus christ we asked it amen this great night that we are celebrating of the crucifixion of our blessed lord i wish to read tonight from his own precious lips the words that he has had written in his book in saint matthews the fourth chapter we in the 47th and 48th verse we read this and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the public and so but be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect and tonight we gave out that we were going to speak on the subject of perfection now we that seems like a very strange text to take for the night of the crucifixion of our lord but today perhaps you've been listening to the radio and hear the different messages and the messengers how they presented that great awful day when our lord died for the sins of the world so i have chosen tonight to go around a different way to get to it so it would be a little different it might refreshing you a little may the blessed holy spirit inspire the word now as we take the effort to bring it god requires perfection we want to bear that in mind that there's nothing just part way can go in the presence of god it must be perfect our worship everything i in the garden of eden god had adam and eve in the garden and they sinned and transgressed the laws of god by sinning disobedience and when transgression comes disobedience is the transgression of the law and the law of god him being holy just unadulterated holy therefore no spot of unholiness can ever stand in his presence so if sin came in the world by transgression then sin must be dealt with before the sinner can ever stand in the presence of god now if there is no law then there is no justice but law require justice requires a law and the law when it is it is uh recalled on it projects justice now by the law no flesh is saved now the law cannot save us the law was just the thing that put us in jail but it has no redeeming power the law only showed us that we were sinners and condemned us that's what law is to do it's to bring condemned nation or to show you where your mistake is so the law in itself could not save it could only prosecute and god being holy and just he had to have a prosecution he had to prosecute the sinner because he had overstepped the bounties of grace and has become a law-breaking citizen then he must be dealt with and the every law has a penalty for the penalty of transgressing god's law is death and it had to project death to the human race and all of the human race is under the penalty of this law now when adam and eve had sinned there was no way no other remedy that they could ever stand in the presence of god again except this sin be dealt with and no man can commit a sin of any type no matter how little or how big that individual sin has to be dealt with before the one who committed it can ever stand in the presence of the holy god so therefore when adam and eve had sinned and have transgressed the law they were subjects of death and the law had to be executed therefore it put all the human race under the penalty of death now if we can only settle down for a few moments now in our thinking and look at this great picture and remember that every person here is included in this every man and woman child is included in the penalty of death by the transgression of the head of the human race adam by his transgression every one of us fell victim to sin and sin must be dealt with and so god in his great infancy and his great love the law was to separate the sinner from his maker then he become annihilated and totally annihilated there would be no way for him to ever come back unless that sin was dealt with and it would be very easy then to believe in a total annihilation of the sinner at the end for he is completely forever separated from the presence of god now notice this sin and how god being just and he could do nothing else but be just for he is the resource of all justice then there would be nothing else for him to do but to place the penalty for this transgression and the penalty was death for he said the day you eat thereof that day thou shall surely die now it's a dark picture we have here but then if we go back just a little further and find out the very attributes of god the bible plainly tells us that god is love but yet being love he has to be just so love does not mean just the thing that can be petted and played with love is the justice of god now when god seen that his children have transgressed his law and that they must die the death then sovereign love stepped in to make a way for god seen that these children was to be absolutely totally annihilated from his presence there was nothing else to be done for they had transgressed his law and the penalty of his law was death and then love of god went out for his subjects and when divine love is projected sovereign grace produces the object of the love and god by foreign knowledge when he loved his race so well yet with the penalty he caused the substitutionary death to take place in the garden of eden amen that was he substituted an innocent creature a little lamb that no no sin and it went for a substitute to work and to die in the stead of the guilty sinner and it was a lamb slain to hold the life of his subjects all through the old testament they offered the blood of lambs and goats sheep bulls and heifers a substitutionary death but all in the great economy of god there was back in his mind the real coming which would be them were shadows of the real object that was to come and the real object was to come was his only begotten son all the lambs that died was only a shadow and a shadow is only the negative side of an object and they only spoke of calvary coming now for a picture of this let's turn in our bibles to the book of hebrews and pick up here what paul the great apostle speaking trying to separate these things for us in the 10th chapter of the book of hebrews we read this and i just love the word the word is the truth and i like to read it before my congregation because i know that in the judgment i'll stand with them now i've got to give an account so if i bring it from the word then i'll not be guilty because it's the word and god's responsible for his word we see so much today of evangelists and so forth building up around personalities oh it's a disgraceful thing and we find out in going into churches we go into church and you find a certain pastor he's got some little peculiar act about him some little emotion if you don't notice the entire congregation will take that spirit if he's just a little emotional or jerks his head or some little odd thing well the whole church will take on to that and we've got today in our modern churches the word it's sensations and little things like that and it's got such a confusion but oh my beloved brethren if there ever was a time that we ought to be on the word it's today you see i would hate to stand at the judgment and know that i had some little ficklety something of a lose peculiar revelation and misled people i don't want them to have my spirit on my action but i want them to have god's spirit by god's word that produces truth so on this great occasion tonight i would like to read from god's eternal word now we realize that the law existed for many years but the law could never take away sin as i have said in the past it was just a jail house it was the great detective that told you what you had done but had no remedy to deliver you it puts you in the pawn shop but there was no redeemer to take you out with it it only prisoned you to let you know that you was a sinner but now notice in hebrews the 10th chapter as we read for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image remember it was a shadow of an image to come a shadow only introduces that there is a image making the shadow a shadow of the things to come and not the very image notice all the things the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which were offered continually make the camera unto perfect now god in the beginning required perfection amen jesus when he come to earth said be ye perfect like god in heaven is perfect and the law having a shadow of things to come could never make the worshiper perfect you got the picture now let's go it again so you'll be sure not to miss it god requires perfect holiness no one can stand in his image with one little speck of sin jesus witnessed the same and said be perfect just like god in heaven is perfect and the bible said that the law could never with its sacrifices make the comer perfect then the law could not perfect anything it was only a pointer these sacrifices made every year could never make the worshiper perfect so therefore no one under the law or keeping of laws or under the shadows could be perfect for second verse then would they not have ceased to been offered if there is anything that i can do to make myself perfect in the presence of god then christ did not have to die for me if there's one thing that you can do that would merit anything in the presence of god then christ died in vain no law keeping no legalistic ideas of yours none of your own holiness no things that you could quit doing quit lying quick stealing quit smoking tobacco quit going to the picture shows still you are lost nothing can do it joining churches rituals ceremonies baptisms orders of the church reading of creeds saying of prayers all those things would count nothing you are lost not one thing can you do in yourself you are a sinner under condemnation and there's not no way within yourself or any creed are any thing that you could do or think of of yourself that could merit one thing in the presence of god amen because you are a sinner to start with and the bible declares that we were all born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies and god could not take one man to die for the other because one is just as guilty as the other in the presence of god the archbishop born in this world was as guilty as the lowest barfly in the city amen one can not atone for the other therefore he took an innocent life of an animal a little lamb and under the old testament the law was when a man sinned he brought the lamb to the altar say if he transgressed any of the commandments he brought the lamb and he laid it on the altar he laid his hands upon the land and he confessed these sins that he was wrong and know that he was guilty of and was the law required death and he brought the lamb and he stood and when he the throat of the little animal was cut and it's beginning to kick its little feet and bladey if you ever seen a lamb slaughtered what a pitiful cry the poor little fellow trying to blate and his little jugger veins cut and as he kicks and squivers and as he straightens out then quivers again and breaks and the blood gushes it bathes his little wool and the worshiper's hands and as a worshiper realizing for committing adultery for lying stealing whatever his guilt was or even evil thinking whatever it was in the least shadow he was guilty because it was his nature he was a guilty person not maybe by bizarre but by nature he was guilty and he had to recognize that this innocent little lamb died in his place and he felt sorry for the little thing but the man as soon as the lamb finally died with the blood of the lamb upon his hands he walked from the building with the same desire in his heart that he had at the beginning why because the life that was in the little lamb life lays in the blood your life is in your blood we know that and the life in the blood of the lamb was animal life therefore when its little car puzzles were broken and the life went out of the animal it could not come back to the worshiper because the worshiper was a human being the blood made a covering but it could not perfectly atone for the man left the building with the same desire to sin as he had in the first place but doing this he was looking forward to a time when there would be a perfect lamb come and he did it on the burnt offering because it was the only way he knew about so you see when the blood was pouring and the life went from the animal it could not come back to the man for one was animal one was man an innocent animal to a guilty man but oh one day some 2 000 years ago the lamb of god was born down in a little manger in bethlehem and was led like a sheep to its slaughter some 1900 years ago this afternoon at 3 o'clock he died the spotless blemish lamb of god hung on calvary's cross and died forever sinner amen now when the worshiper comes to this land by faith and this is a different type of land amen it's not a land like the other no man can come to this lamb except god draws him first you see god's sovereignty oh i hope this soaks way down deep now look god know he had sheep in this world he knowed he was going to have people to be saved and his love looked down and seen those who would be saved therefore by for knowledge he predestinated a church to meet any other without spock or randall amen and if god required a church without spot or ankle he had to have something to make it that way he could not require his justice his judgments could not let him as such a thing if there wasn't a way to make it forever and man can not do it in himself amen he's a total failure god let him see that through the law through the judges and through all the old testament he sent the prophets he sent the righteous man and they found out that everyone failed so god by his sovereign grace sent from the portals of glory his only begotten son to take our place remember if he said for the pope of rome to take it he could not have done it amen if he'd have said for the archbishop of canterbury to do it he could not have done it amen if he would have called on the most holy reverend father or bishop of the world he could not have done it he had been just as far rejected as judas is carrick what amen he could not do it because he was born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies and needed atonement for himself hallelujah but there came one from the portals of glory none other not a man not a good man neither a junior a gentile he was nothing less than almighty god hid in human flesh [Applause] [Music] he came himself to offer his own blood for it did not come to sex sex had nothing to do with it but he overshadowed a virgin and brought forth from a blood cell that he created himself the innocent one then my salvation yours tonight does not hinge upon the merits of our own acts it ends up on the positive sovereign grace of almighty god who has chosen us certainly i could never be perfect nor you could never be perfect and we don't claim to be perfect but we have this one consolation that our faith rests in a perfect sacrifice that's already been received then how do we know that we get that when the worshiper puts his hands by faith upon the body of the lord jesus and feels the tear of sin and the mark of spit in his own face feels the groanings of gethsemane the agonies of cavalry and knows that he's guilty and confesses his sins correctly o blessed lord i am guilty and i have no other way but you to help me and by faith you're bidding the holy spirit has come and bids me come and i'm now by faith except jesus as my personal savior am i that life that come from him on calvary called the holy ghost which was hid in the blood cell of the lord jesus returns to the worshipper and baptizes him with the holy ghost into the body of christ amen and he's already judged amen you don't have to worry about judgment as i turn and look at that little crucifix i realize that that is represents his body and now that body has already been judged god can't justly judge it again for it's already judged amen god struck the judgments of death upon that body and as long as i can find a way to get hid in that body his judgment was struck for me and for you we are free romans 8 1 said there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus that walk not after the flesh but at jesus there you are no condemnation i don't care what comes or what those you are hid beneath the blood again how do we get into that body first corinthians 12 13 says that by spirit how does the spirit come to the sacrifice where did the spirit lay within the blood why couldn't the animal come back it was an animal the animal spirit could not come to the human spirit and do anything to it because the human spirit was a higher line of life than the animal but no other man's spirit could come back if you've got the spirit of some ancestor it's spiritualism but god himself came that his own spirit which is the highest line of spirit there is can come back by the form of the baptism of the holy spirit to the worshipper through the blood of christ and take him into the body he's safe watch the blood of bulls and goats would not work seeing it was weak now let's start reading about the 12th verse all right the blood of bulls and goats cannot work neither could it atone watch but this man what man the bishop the pope no but this man after he offered one sacrifice for sin forever sat down at the right hand of god amen from his fourth expectant tell his enemies be made his footstool are you ready are you ready for the word listen to this they don't want to you know let it sink down listen closely far by one offering not year by year not revival after revival not meeting after meeting not day after day but by one offering he has p-e-r-f-e-c-t-e-d they have he has by one offering he has perfected that's god's requirement for ever them that are sanctified america there you are that's the answer to the death of christ that's the answer to calvary he absolutely with his own blood purchased our sins and perfected forever his believers therefore in christ we stand blameless thank him in the presence of god almighty amen amen we are underprivileged people with our own doctrines we are being taught that we have to get up to a certain place we have to do a certain thing no my brother it's nothing you've done it's what god did for you we are now if we are justified by faith we are perfected forever in the presence of god then jesus said be therefore perfect then it was perfected forever god to the death of christ 1900 years ago today perfected the believer that he foresaw before the foundation world forever and those who he has called he has justified those who he foreknew he has called those who he has called he has justified those who he had justified he had already glorified he has perfected his believers now watch this go back now to the first verse the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of those things can never with those sacrifices which were offered year by year continually make the calmer on to perfect what's perfect is what we're talking about for then they should not have ceased to be offered because that the worshiper once purged would have no more conscience of sin what do you mean the word conscience there and right interpretation is desire and if a man comes a worshiper correctly before christ seeing his suffering and he offers himself to christ and says oh lord god there's nothing in me that can atone but i'm wholly depending on you then that holy spirit comes into the human heart the very same question settled forever amen forever desired sin has been taken from you for if the law could have done that then sacrifices will not have deceased but being that it could not do it christ had to die to make us perfect friends there is so many things that we could say tonight about the profession we are always trying to gouge the eyes out of somebody else to make ourselves just a little holier than they are they are but if we only looked at the picture it's only god's grace that we are what we are there's some time ago i learned a lesson a hard way i was having a meeting down in ohio and i was staying out in the country because of the masses i cannot stay in the city we've been eating at a little dunkered restaurant and such lovely little waitresses and decently dressed and clean as they could be very ladylike waited on us it was a little spot of heaven so eat in such a place their kitchen was and span and on sunday they closed up and they went to their church i got a little hungry let's go to preach sunday afternoon and i went over to an ordinary little just a common little american restaurant to get something to eat and when i walked in the door what did i hear but a slot machine going and was standing there a man of my age which perhaps was a married man with his arm around a woman playing a slot machine our very law the protection of our righteousness of our goods we're standing there violating a thing that he is supposed to be protecting because it's illegal to gamble in ohio playing a slot machine and i turned and looked towards the back of the building there was a bunch of teenage boys in an old rock and roll records on the machine playing a young lady of about 18 years old very neatly uh an anatomy as a woman but she was standing there with her dress hanging low in the front and one of those boys with his hands on the girl where they did not belong and they were smoking and drinking and i thought oh god how can you stand it and i looked over to my right when i heard someone make out a big drone and there said an aged woman probably 60 years or 70 years old she had on those little old bugger clothes just about halfway up her limbs and her poor old wrinkled flesh was just as flabby as it could be and she had on this shirt lip makeup and a great big purple thing on the side of her face painted a little pair of shoes on sandals with purple toenails painted purple fingernails painted and her hair was cut real sharp and curled up and died blue and i looked at her and across the table set two man drunk one of them it was summertime with a big old army overcoat on with a gray scarf wrapped around his neck and if whiskers all over his face of belching and going on and they excuse herself the man did from her and started walking out like this to the restroom i stood there and i said god why don't you destroy the whole thing why don't you just sink it beneath the earth i said is my little sarah and rebecca going to have to grow up under such stuff is that i said how can you god in your great holiness ever stand to look at such a thing like that and not send an earthquake and sink it as i was standing there condemning the woman as i was i stepped back behind the door i felt the spirit of god come to me and i stepped behind the door and i seen like something whirling and when it was in the vision it was a world turning around and around and as i noticed around the world was a scarlet streak around the world and as i got to the world i seen myself just a little boy doing things that i ought not to do maybe not like that but it was sin and every time i did anything i seen that great black shadow go towards heaven which god would have killed me at that minute then our scene standing between me and god stood that perfect sacrifice i seen him standing there with the thorns on his head and his spit hanging on his face and every time my sins would start towards god he'd reach out and catch it like the bumper on the car he was protecting me from death and every time i do anything wrong god would have killed me certainly his holiness requires it his law requires it and every time i do anything or you do anything the blood of jesus christ acts like a bumper and i seen that scarlet street meant that then that the blood still holds the earth and as i stood looking i got a little closer to him as i noticed him now i can hear him say father forgive him he doesn't know what he's doing and i looked down in there laid a book and there's a recording angel there and standing by his side and every time i sinned it was put out on the book and my name was on it and i realized that someday ah that blood streak would be lifted and i'd have to stand in the presence of god with my sinful life but i seen by his mercy he was holding off my judgment i went to him humbly i knelt on my knees and i said oh jesus thou son of god i am unworthy to come in your presence but will you please forgive me for what i have done he touched his side with his hand tucked the old book and wrote pardon on it throwed it back behind him and my sins were gone then he looked me stern in the face he said now i have forgiven you but you want to condemn her then i've seen what it meant as i come out of the vision i walked over to her i said how do you do she was drinking she looked up at me and she said oh hello i said could i sit down she said i have company i said i don't need it in that way lady i just want to speak to you a minute she said be seated and i said lady just a few minutes ago standing at her behind that door i begin to tell her as i begin to look the tears begin to run down her cheeks and she told me i said lady you don't mean to do these things jesus died and the judgments of god is held off by his blood you don't mean to do this and she said no sir she said my father was a deacon in church i was raised in a christian home my husband and i were charter members and lived the christian life she began to tell me after his death she had two young girls and she went astray and how the girls had left her and she told her life away and she thought there was no more hope for her i said god be merciful those who he has four knew he has called amen she said are you reverend branham from daddy i said i am she said i'm ashamed of myself to be sitting here like this she said do you think there would be a chance for me i said jesus has his arm stretched out waiting for you to come lady and the other people begin to take up and i said would you walk out here on this floor with me she said i will sir i took her by the hand i said you're about the age of my mother would you kneel there with me the floor and there in the floor we broke up that place that afternoon to an old-fashioned meeting and god saved that woman by his grace am i she dressed yourself and come to the meeting and as far as i know living a christian life tonight amen what is it oh god requires perfection he requires your repentance he requires your loyalty to him but he's looking tonight no matter how much you sin how little or how much you are still a sinner and cannot get in no other way but by jesus christ god's all-sufficient sacrifice and in him you are perfected forever think of it it's not nothing you do it's not new pages you turn it's not a new life you start it's a confession of your wrong and god's grace to you that brings you to perfection and you are perfected in jesus christ i trust tonight friend of mine while we are here at this great crucial moment now when decisions must be made after hearing this story you might have never heard it before but you can't go out one of those doors the same person you come in you must go out better or worse and while we bow our heads just a moment i want you to thank mightily about it what about your soul tonight jesus christ died for you you say brother branham when i can get quit smoking when i can quit drinking when i can straighten this thing up i'll do it oh it will never be done right you'll never be able to do it why don't you just come the way you are and by faith go to that stream thy flowing wound supply then redeeming love to be your theme and shall be till you die why take a substitute while i try to get in by your church why try to come in because you quit drinking or quit lying come by the way of perfection for about one sacrifice he has perfected forever those that are sanctified how do i get sanctified confess your sins in the presence of the blood of jesus and the life that come from that blood comes back to the worshiper and sanctifies him from the desires of the things of the world for about that all sufficient sacrifice he has sanctified us one spirit we are all baptized into one body now there's no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus to them that walk not after the flesh but the spirit if you're trying to walk by the spirit and still lusting for the flesh the sacrifice hasn't been sufficiently applied to you but the worshiper once purged has no more desire of sin that was calvary it isn't a place to sell flowers or a little place to do this or that it was a place where god and men were reconciled it was a place where peace and perfect safety was brought to mankind can you go with me tonight my sinner friend to calvary and by faith apply this blood to your own soul and let the holy ghost come and sanctify you by his great sacrifice amen before we pray would you raise your hand to god and say be merciful me god i now confess all my sins upon this good friday night and i appreciate the great suffering that christ did for me i now surrender my own will my own motives and everything to follow you from this day henceforth will you raise your hand say remember me brother in prayer that's the decision in my heart is there any this great night while we wait just a moment over your own my right hand side surely there's one along there are you ashamed of your sins are you ashamed of what you've done the world tonight is looking for heroes and it has heroes physically speaking one day younger in switzerland once switzerland was at stake the little swiss party had gathered out into the fields to defend their economy the great oncoming army was too great for them they were all trained had big spears and shields the swiss could do nothing but give up they were backed up against the mountain then there was a hero stepped out somebody had to die and if they lost the battle they had nothing old sickle blades and rocks sticks to fight with when the oncoming army looked like a brick wall if they were taken their lovely little wives would be ravished their young girls would be ravished their babies would be killed their heads would be busted their homes would be gone everything would be lost then there was a man whose name is too quickly forgotten by the name of arnold von wicklord he stepped out and said man of switzerland this day i give my life for switzerland he said just over the mountain honor is a little white home i've got a wife and three children waiting for me but they'll never see me again for this day i'd give my life for switzerland they said what will you do arnold von week lord he said follow me and do the best you can with what you have to do with and he looked over the army until he found the thickest of the spears then he stuck up his hands in the air he run towards that big brick wall of spears and screaming make way for liberty make way for liberty a hundred spears turn to catch his charge he threw his arms out and grouped them into his own bosom which pinned him down and he died on the end of those spears those swiss followed him with clubs and sticks that great display of heroism rotted that army till the swiss beat them out of the land and they've never had a war from that day since stand up in switzerland and name the name of the arnold von winkler you'll see tears run down their cheeks why he saved the land that was a great hero deed it's seldom compared with and never exceeded in this earth but oh it was a little thing to what happened one day when adam's race stood demons marching in from every side prophets had failed law had failed sacrifice of bulls and lambs had failed man's nature had failed everything and adam's little race stood defeated outnumbered by devils superstitions sickness diseases there was one stepped out in heaven and said this day i'll die for adam's race he came to the earth and was made flesh he looked like down where the midst of the spears was the darkest the very darkest of all man's dreads was death and he took death into his bosoming on calvary he paid the sacrifice and scream make a way for liberty and he screams to his church take this which i have left you my blood and my spirit and fight with every what you've got we can conquer tonight to that friend you can drive the devil from you every old enemy that's in your life it can be drove out by the blood and the spirit of christ and you can stand perfect in his presence christ made the way could you do as much as lift your arm to him and say forgive me god bless you brother someone else being merciful to me god i now confess my wrongs is there some lukewarm church members who go to church every day and maybe try to be as pious as can be but yet you know that temper and indifference and selfishness habits clean you down till you don't have victory would you want to be cleansed by the blood tonight from all of that for the worshiper once purge has no more conscience amen would you like to lift your hands you church member god bless you lady lift your hands and say brother branham remember me in prayer god bless you lady that's right that's a real that's a real thing to do god bless you back there sir someone else lift your hand say be merciful to me god i know i profess christianity but i don't live it i know i don't and in my heart i'm really not right with you i want to be one of god's elected i feel in my heart that i am but have never laid aside the weights that this easily beset me i want to lay him aside tonight and by god's grace i'll do it pray for me would you raise your hand god bless you lady someone else just so we're waiting while we're waiting quietly everyone now with your heads bowed in prayer softly hum this there is a foul to fill with blood drawn from amen your faith and sin nurse plunge be leave [Music] stains [Music] loose won't you think it over just now [Music] don't try to wash it off christ is on your hand pilate tried it this morning along about six o'clock but his hands are still bloody guilty bloody you know what happened to him he went up in switzerland many years later lost his mind plunged himself to death in a pool of water this morning in switzerland hundreds of people come to watch the scene blue water boils up the bottom of that big hole of water they do it every year it's an old legend they say that god refused water to cleanse his hands brother no matter how many times you're baptized whatever you try to do nothing will cleanse your hands but the blood of christ god refused it in the blue water at your two thousand years nearly still ball up god refuses it your self righteousness cannot cleanse your sins nothing but the blood of jesus [Music] think of it now we're going to pray just a moment i wonder if i could ask something tonight when he stood there at pilate's judgment hall this morning and said if my kingdom was of this world i could speak to my father and straightway he would send me 12 legions of angels when one of them could destroy the world i speak to him in 12 legions of angels to be right at my disposal he could have done it but he stood there meek and humble to take your death and take your sins will you be grateful enough for that sacrifice tonight you who are needy of it and needy of god's blessings would you stand to your feet for this prayer just stand up to your feet you who want to be remembered in this prayer saying god be merciful to me i'm guilty i've done things wrong and i now want to accept my pardon through christ jesus will you come to your feet just at this time god bless you young lady that's a courage just remain standing there do you mean to tell me you raised your hand and then not sincere enough to stand to your feet what good has the gospel ever done to you oh such playing with church playing with god the hours soon at hand one of these days an atomic bomb will strike around here somewhere where these big power plants there will not be one split second to think it over it'll be too late then and maybe before next easter or even this easter won't you stand now say god be merciful to me as sinner i accept christ by though offering himself as the propitiation for my sins and by his grace and his grace alone i in the presence of god will you confess you're wrong he that will hide his sins shall not prosper he that confesses sin has mercy [Music] up to you he's watching now our blessed lord in the appropriated number tonight stands three penitent souls one man and two women as i am thanking lord of calvary when one on one side said lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom the other one said if thou be let us see a miracle take us off the cross and save yourself and the other and said god be merciful to me and your head swung to its right side and said today shalt thou be with me in paradise but you were quiet to the other one because there was no repentance father god i pray that these maybe i'll trust that they are the only three in the building that feels that they do need to confess their wrongs but that they have come the all-sufficient way of the way of the cross forgive them lord and bless them they are standing here tonight as you stood for them in pilate's judgment hall as you stood for them between the heavens and earth when the sun went down and the moon would not give its light and the veil of the temple was rent from top to bottom i pray god that you'll bless them and give them of thy mercies and cleanse them with thy blood and baptize them by your sanctifying power into the body of your own son christ jesus then they are preserved for our time and eternity bless the others who feel that they are all right that they have already met this and did so i pray this blessing to them in christ's name amen god the last few moments he addresses the church say brother aaron uh i'm past that stage thank god for that but remember bill brown thought he was past that stage too and god had to show him nothing i do nothing you do it's strictly the blood of jesus christ people tell me old brother aaron that was before 1963 no the blood is still i know i know it as as god has unveiled himself more and more but it's still the blood and i appreciate that if you'll stand with me seeing grace how [Music] like me [Music] i was let's sing that same verse one more time [Music] like me i was [Music] just looking at what you've done and i don't know that we could ever comprehend what you've done and you didn't you didn't ask us to understand it to try to figure it out you asked us to accept it to receive it to lay our hands on the sacrifice to be able to receive that life we have such a hard time to believe that we look at ourselves and we'd say but but i still get drawn this way and i still get pulled that way [Music] the flesh man but something down deep inside it says no lord i want to be right with you i want to be covered by the blood i want i want this life to be taken out in your life come in lord your holy spirit dwelling in us lord we thank you for that lord even as you showed your prophet brother branham there with his attitude lord remind us sometimes lord when we get a little bit maybe high-minded a little lofty in ourselves lord that you had to die for every single one of us lord may we be always identified with the christ of calvary i pray lord thank you for that today we appreciate in jesus name [Music] praise god praise god praise god when you think of what he's done all you can do but praise him praise god [Music] praise god praise god praise god praise god [Music] let me just remind you of the words that our brother samuel browning said last service there in flagstaff he said you look at your son you look at your daughter and you look at yourself and you say there's just no way god could he says are you saying that that is greater than god he said no god is greater than all don't look at a situation say it's hopeless say no i'll turn it over to you lord and i'll let you take care of that so just touch my heart to listen to that today and say well that was elementary no it just it just reminds us of the grace of god and makes us love him and appreciate him more so [Music] i appreciate his merciness grace to us amen jesus paid it all all to him i owe sin had left a crimson stain but he washed it with [Music] jesus [Music] a crimson stain [Music] up [Music] oh jesus [Music] and paid a crimson stain [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] sin had left our crimson state [Music] in the blood of calvary's land [Music] to jesus is [Music] amen [Music] thank you lord is all i can say thank you for the peace that comes not in anything you could do and not anything you could could earn then it's no longer grace god bless you tonight touch maybe that was just a serp to remind you he said that's been settled but sometimes it's just good to remember to love him more and because of the grace he had on you you can have mercy on somebody else you can say lord what you did for me do for someone else amen god bless you it's just praying and dismiss the lord we thank you thank you for your word tonight lord it took you took a man who realized that without you he was nothing he walked through oral roberts university and looked at the splendor and the beauty of it all and it was awed by it and he looked at himself he said lord you you must have known that i could never handle this he felt so low and so well i just wasn't good enough but when he stepped outside of that universe and got away you said no but i am your portion lord and that's the same what we want to hear today that you are our portion heart not all that's out in this world not that's offered but in christ alone may we trust in that and believe that today may be with your children as they go home the bless the rest of this week lord watch over them till we gather again lord to praise you and worship you in jesus christ's name amen [Music] bless the lord all my soul and all that is within me for he has done great things [Music] that is within me blesses me and all that is within me blesses me for he has done great things he has done great things he has done great things for he has done great things [Music] he has done great he has done great things blessings god bless you tonight oh my soul is [Music] and all that is [Music] you
