[45:35] the scripture this this evening in the
[45:38] book of colossians chapter 1
[45:43] and we ministered this morning on
[45:46] examining
[45:49] the deity of christ
[45:52] and this evening i'd like to follow that
[45:54] thought
[45:55] with
[45:56] examining
[45:58] christ in you
[46:00] and so
[46:02] we're just going to
[46:03] follow a little bit of a thought process
[46:05] that we have there
[46:07] and
[46:09] it may not go exactly the way that we
[46:12] maybe thought that it would but there's
[46:15] many good little nuggets in here
[46:17] we spent a lot of time this morning
[46:21] we made reference to a lot of bible
[46:23] verses
[46:24] and but we stayed a lot in the quotes
[46:28] this evening we'll stay a lot with bible
[46:31] verses and make more reference to the
[46:33] quotes
[46:34] and we'll just see how things dovetail
[46:36] very nicely i appreciate a message that
[46:39] is bible-based amen
[46:42] praise the lord in colossians chapter 1
[46:44] we want to read
[46:46] one verse of scripture there
[46:48] and verse 27 colossians chapter 1 and
[46:51] verse 27
[46:53] to whom god would make known what is the
[46:56] riches
[46:58] of the glory
[47:00] of this mystery
[47:03] among the gentiles this is this is a
[47:05] mystery
[47:06] among the gentiles which is christ in
[47:09] you
[47:11] the hope of glory
[47:14] may the lord bless the reading of the
[47:15] word this evening as you make yourselves
[47:17] comfortable
[47:20] amen
[47:22] i'm trusting that we got our powerpoint
[47:25] there dear brother
[47:28] and
[47:31] amazing
[47:34] this is this is this is an awesome age
[47:36] that we live in because we can
[47:38] we can
[47:40] we can all read these things
[47:42] together i want to
[47:48] start this evening
[47:50] this is uh
[47:52] brother branham
[47:53] we read this quote this morning
[47:56] it says
[47:57] and that brought forth the very creative
[47:59] blood of god to redeem us from our life
[48:02] coming in here being born of sexual
[48:04] desire
[48:06] and then that blood was drawn out of
[48:09] god with us is that right
[48:11] emmanuel's veins on calvary's cross and
[48:14] today has the same saving redeeming holy
[48:17] power that it did the day that the
[48:19] transfusion
[48:21] was made
[48:23] out at calvary you believe it
[48:26] that's what we're just reading the quote
[48:29] amen now that's right we're redeemed by
[48:32] the blood of god the bible says that we
[48:34] are bought
[48:36] by the blood
[48:38] and redeemed by blood god's own blood so
[48:41] we spent a goodly amount of time this
[48:44] morning breaking down each of these
[48:46] highlighted potions now then we
[48:48] understand that the bible says that you
[48:50] are
[48:51] not your own
[48:53] is that right
[48:54] amen they were my wife was reading a bit
[48:57] of an article listening to an article
[48:58] this afternoon how that they were going
[49:00] to
[49:01] they were forcing the air national guard
[49:03] to take the vaccination or they would
[49:05] uh uh that they would withhold their pay
[49:08] uh another place that they there was
[49:11] actually uh military people were going
[49:14] to be uh their service was going to be
[49:16] terminated with other than honorable
[49:19] conditions and they were going to lose
[49:21] out on a military career unless
[49:23] they took the vaccination
[49:25] and there was all this big hype and
[49:27] everything as to you know that it was
[49:28] unconstitutional everything but i'm
[49:31] sorry i've been there done that
[49:33] amen got the tattoo to prove it
[49:35] amen if god if the u.s government says
[49:38] you take a shot you take a shot
[49:41] there's no questions
[49:42] you're not because why you're not your
[49:45] own
[49:46] you sign the dotted line you belong to
[49:49] the us government you're a property of
[49:51] the united states government with a
[49:53] single
[49:54] commander-in-chief
[49:55] and you've got to do what he said you
[49:57] signed the dotted line they tell you
[49:59] that before and you raised your hand and
[50:00] you swore an oath
[50:02] well uh unfortunately
[50:05] that's man's army and i you know i i
[50:08] feel sorry for them boys because it's
[50:10] really not right for them to have to lay
[50:13] down their life like that and and then
[50:15] be expected to take some sort of a
[50:17] vaccination that there's no scientific
[50:18] proof that it'll help you nominate a
[50:20] prone or khan on whether or not
[50:23] we should take the vaccination or not
[50:25] because some vaccinations were very good
[50:26] in time past such as polio and all these
[50:29] different things but there's so there
[50:31] there's no there's not enough given
[50:34] enough time on the modern day
[50:35] vaccinations for covid for them to go
[50:38] ahead and mandate that you get it now
[50:40] then if you voluntarily go and do that
[50:42] because you have confidence in that then
[50:43] it's not in the vaccination but your
[50:45] confidence is in god and that god is
[50:48] able to keep you in your soul now it's
[50:50] faith is your victory and you're
[50:51] trusting god you're not trusting in the
[50:53] vaccination so if your job requires it
[50:56] or whatever then you know go with the
[50:58] dictates of your heart and you know i
[51:00] don't think it's a place here at the
[51:02] pulpit for us to make a
[51:04] a gripe or an argument over the pros and
[51:07] cons of something that we really don't
[51:09] know unless you're a medical
[51:10] professional then you have some room for
[51:14] an argument but i don't have that and
[51:16] you know for me personally
[51:18] i'm just going to trust god for now and
[51:20] just keep moving on but but but what we
[51:23] come from was that uh where that the
[51:26] scripture says you are
[51:28] bought
[51:29] by the blood
[51:30] you're not your own amen aren't you glad
[51:33] for that that i'm not my own i belong to
[51:35] jesus praise the lord he bought and paid
[51:38] and redeemed me as we said this morning
[51:41] that redeemed redemption speaks of prior
[51:43] ownership and so he was able to buy you
[51:46] who were sold under sin
[51:48] is that right sold under sin put in the
[51:50] devil's pawn shop but you belong to god
[51:53] first and so then god comes back he
[51:56] knows those who are his and therefore he
[51:58] can purchase you back through redemption
[52:01] by the blood god's own
[52:04] blood now
[52:06] in second corinthians it says to win
[52:08] that god was in christ reconciling the
[52:11] world unto himself not imputing their
[52:13] trespasses unto them and hath committed
[52:17] unto us
[52:18] the word
[52:20] of reconciliation now i really like this
[52:23] this uh this statement here of the word
[52:26] of reconciliation reconciliation
[52:30] has the um it has a really neat uh
[52:33] definition uh over i was reading a
[52:36] commentary i think it was spiro zodiates
[52:39] and he made a comment he said that
[52:41] reconciliation
[52:42] speaks of the the elasticity
[52:46] or the the the recoil of an elastic
[52:50] property so we all understand what
[52:52] elastic is right
[52:54] you know you got you got a rubber band
[52:56] and that's elastic in other words it it
[52:58] it stretches to full capacity and then
[53:01] it comes back and so i i like this word
[53:04] reconciliation because it speaks of this
[53:07] elasticity or coming back to this
[53:10] relaxed state
[53:11] that it because we are stretched
[53:14] all right is that right so we look at
[53:16] laodicea laodicea has brought us through
[53:19] the seven church ages now we've come and
[53:22] it's
[53:24] and we're stretched to capacity but now
[53:28] at the end of the ages there's going to
[53:30] come a message or a word
[53:33] of reconciliation that will bring us
[53:36] back
[53:37] hallelujah from that
[53:40] tinsel from that stretched
[53:42] condition back to a relaxed state
[53:45] oh i like that i just i just think
[53:47] that's marvelous because i if you i wish
[53:50] i had a rubber band here but if we
[53:52] stretched it to its
[53:54] maximum and we let it go all of a sudden
[53:57] what happens it flies away amen oh
[54:00] what's going to happen to the church in
[54:02] a moment and in a twinkling of an eye
[54:05] i'm talking about the word of
[54:07] reconciliation that's going to bring us
[54:09] from this this this this
[54:12] stress express hallelujah from this rat
[54:16] race from this from this nervous tension
[54:19] of an age that we are not designed to
[54:22] live in and god is going to bring us to
[54:24] a relaxed state called the wedding
[54:26] supper of the lamb and i'm going to fly
[54:28] away some glad morning when this life is
[54:31] over i'll fly away amen i'm not going to
[54:34] stay here another minute longer than
[54:36] what i'm supposed to amen i want to get
[54:39] out of here in a moment in a twinkling
[54:41] of an eye i'm talking about amen a word
[54:45] of reconciliation
[54:49] in romans chapter 5
[54:51] it speaks of an imputed
[54:54] righteousness now
[54:56] the bible one of the compound redemptive
[54:58] names of jehovah
[55:01] is
[55:02] jehovah sick in you
[55:04] and this means the lord
[55:07] our righteousness in other words he has
[55:10] become
[55:11] our righteousness that we had no
[55:13] righteousness of our own our
[55:16] righteousness is as of filthy
[55:18] rags is that right and so the the
[55:21] filthiness of those rags
[55:24] is is the best that we can produce but
[55:27] the bible says that even the
[55:29] righteousness of god which is by faith
[55:33] of jesus christ aren't you glad for that
[55:36] unto all and upon all them that believe
[55:38] for there is no difference for all have
[55:41] sinned and come short of the glory of
[55:43] god but being freely
[55:46] being justified freely by his grace
[55:49] through the redemption
[55:51] that is in jesus christ so that now that
[55:54] our redemption is based upon
[55:57] the righteous lamb of god taking our
[56:00] place he took my place he put on
[56:04] the robes of my unrighteousness he
[56:07] became sin so that i could become
[56:10] righteousness through the faith of the
[56:12] son of god now
[56:14] because we had all sin but without him
[56:16] there is no redemption but he justified
[56:20] or made it as though we had never done
[56:22] it in the first place brotherhood tells
[56:24] us that's the definition of justified is
[56:27] that we never done it in the first place
[56:30] freely amen aren't you glad that it was
[56:32] freely by grace so grace is the
[56:36] unmerited gift or the unmerited favor of
[56:39] god that you receive without works for
[56:42] amen we are saved through grace
[56:45] not by works
[56:47] but yet we do works because we are saved
[56:51] because we are the children of god
[56:52] because we have been redeemed and
[56:55] therefore we manifest the life that was
[56:58] in christ for it's christ
[57:00] in you
[57:01] the hope of glory now
[57:05] he said whom god hath sent forth
[57:07] to be a propitiation now this word
[57:10] propitiation we're going to spend some
[57:12] time on
[57:14] through faith
[57:15] in his blood
[57:16] to declare his righteousness for the
[57:19] remission of sins that are passed
[57:21] through the forbearance of god now
[57:23] there's a lot of language here but
[57:25] basically what we're seeing here is that
[57:28] faith amen has
[57:30] uh uh
[57:31] appropriated
[57:33] our
[57:35] faith has appropriated our righteousness
[57:38] which has been imputed to us in other
[57:40] words that that we didn't deserve it but
[57:44] yet god placed
[57:45] his righteousness
[57:48] upon you
[57:50] you didn't deserve it it was it was a
[57:52] free gift
[57:54] it was free to you but it wasn't free
[57:57] hello
[57:58] it cost somebody something that's how he
[58:01] could say that you are bought with the
[58:03] price the precious blood of jesus so
[58:06] this word propitiation is what carries
[58:10] that the weight
[58:12] of our redemption without a perpetuator
[58:14] then our redemption
[58:16] uh is cheapened you see and so we can't
[58:19] cheapen the redeemer is that right amen
[58:22] but when you see the the pricelessness
[58:25] of the redeemer then you understand what
[58:28] the price was paid
[58:30] for you
[58:31] deal moody said it like this
[58:34] amen he said i'm not too concerned about
[58:36] what man thinks about me
[58:39] i'm only concerned about what god thinks
[58:42] about me
[58:43] you tell me what christ is worth and
[58:46] i'll tell you what i am worth
[58:49] amen
[58:50] that right he said sitting before me is
[58:53] he said he said if i had in my hand a
[58:55] charger with two drops of the literal
[58:58] blood of jesus christ in it he said he
[59:00] said it would be so precious to me he
[59:03] said but sitting before me is something
[59:05] more precious
[59:07] amen so you are the purchase
[59:10] of that blood the purchase is more
[59:12] valuable
[59:13] amen than the price paid
[59:17] the word perpetuation
[59:20] uses the word an expiratory
[59:23] it is used in the sense of
[59:26] the ending of rage or sorrow
[59:29] or pain or suffering or embarrassment or
[59:33] any of the negatives that you want to
[59:35] find there
[59:36] it is the end of rage it's the end of
[59:39] sorrow
[59:40] by
[59:42] suffering it to the full
[59:44] it comes from the latin word expiate or
[59:47] to appease
[59:48] by sacrifice
[59:50] in other words that there was a price
[59:53] that had to be paid
[59:54] to rid mankind of sorrow and suffering
[59:59] of guilt and shame and death
[1:00:02] so there could only be a there had to
[1:00:04] come a perpetuator
[1:00:06] there had to become an expiratory
[1:00:08] and so the only one that could do that
[1:00:12] to pay the price he had to experience
[1:00:15] your pain
[1:00:17] to the full
[1:00:20] are you with me this evening
[1:00:22] somebody had to fulfill
[1:00:25] by experiential
[1:00:28] taking upon himself
[1:00:30] the full measure of suffering
[1:00:33] in other words he had to drink
[1:00:36] the dredges
[1:00:38] of the wrath of god
[1:00:40] the wine press
[1:00:42] had to be trot out in its fullness it
[1:00:45] couldn't be a partial
[1:00:47] that's why when satan met the lord jesus
[1:00:51] on the mount of temptation
[1:00:53] and he offered him all the kingdoms
[1:00:56] and the glory of all the kingdoms if he
[1:00:58] just bowed down what he could because he
[1:01:01] was the owner
[1:01:03] is that right he owned the physical
[1:01:05] property he lost it because it was sold
[1:01:07] under sin
[1:01:09] so satan could give him the glory of
[1:01:11] glory why because he was the god of the
[1:01:13] evil age
[1:01:15] he was he was a prince and power of the
[1:01:18] air he had the authority to give it but
[1:01:21] if he give it if he gave it to christ
[1:01:24] without suffering
[1:01:26] then at a later date he could have laid
[1:01:28] claims on it because the price hadn't
[1:01:30] been paid and there was no abstract
[1:01:34] so there had to come an abstract in
[1:01:36] other words the price had to be paid the
[1:01:39] history had to be searched all the way
[1:01:40] back to the originator amen and all the
[1:01:43] debts against it had to be paid and the
[1:01:46] only way that that could be done was
[1:01:47] through an expiratory
[1:01:50] hallelujah and so christ then becomes a
[1:01:53] perpetuator he becomes the one because
[1:01:56] he suffered in fullness he took upon him
[1:01:59] that's why when he's hanging there on
[1:02:01] the cross and he said i thirst i might
[1:02:04] not get any further than this amen he
[1:02:07] said i thirst amen who was he he created
[1:02:10] all the water
[1:02:13] couldn't he have put a drop upon his own
[1:02:15] tongue he was a creator couldn't he have
[1:02:18] at least amen
[1:02:20] somehow bypassed
[1:02:24] the scripture said that his tongue
[1:02:27] claimed to the roof of his mouth
[1:02:30] he was dying of thirst of dehydration of
[1:02:33] blood loss
[1:02:35] think about it
[1:02:37] he was dying there he suffered but what
[1:02:40] he said i thirst and they didn't give
[1:02:42] him water to drink but they put vinegar
[1:02:44] and gall
[1:02:46] amen which made it even worse
[1:02:48] amen so that he would suffer to the
[1:02:50] fullness
[1:02:52] because in order to pay the price for
[1:02:55] your thirst
[1:02:58] to pay the price for your suffering to
[1:03:00] pay the price amen for your sickness he
[1:03:03] had to bear the fullness of it and
[1:03:06] therefore he could be the expiratory
[1:03:10] suffering it to the full
[1:03:14] it speaks of the atoning victim
[1:03:20] it speaks especially
[1:03:23] of the lid
[1:03:25] of the ark of the covenant
[1:03:28] the mercy seat
[1:03:32] this is what
[1:03:34] jesus is
[1:03:36] to me
[1:03:38] wrath
[1:03:40] was my punishment it was my paycheck
[1:03:43] for the wages of sin
[1:03:46] is death
[1:03:48] oh but
[1:03:49] the gift of god amen
[1:03:52] is mercy through the lord jesus christ
[1:03:56] in the book of numbers
[1:03:58] chapter 19 verse 1 the bible says
[1:04:02] and the lord spake unto moses
[1:04:06] and unto aaron saying
[1:04:10] i just threw this note in there
[1:04:13] so here was
[1:04:15] god's prophet on the earth
[1:04:17] and god
[1:04:18] speaks to his prophet
[1:04:21] the prophet then speaks to aaron which
[1:04:24] is his ministry is that right
[1:04:27] and then the ministry then speaks to the
[1:04:29] people
[1:04:31] that order has never changed
[1:04:34] it has never changed not even in the
[1:04:36] modern era
[1:04:38] with the benefit of tapes and these kind
[1:04:41] of things where we can hear directly you
[1:04:43] and i can hear directly what the prophet
[1:04:45] of god said to the world
[1:04:47] and that prophet of god tells us that
[1:04:50] there would be a fightful ministry upon
[1:04:52] the earth and a group of young men that
[1:04:54] will take the church on out to the
[1:04:55] rapture
[1:04:57] and so we don't disregard even though
[1:04:59] it's a day of a modern era we still are
[1:05:02] able to take the words of a prophet
[1:05:05] because they're not my words
[1:05:08] they're not even the prophet's words
[1:05:10] sorry
[1:05:12] they are god's words and there is an
[1:05:14] order to those words getting to you and
[1:05:17] i heart now then
[1:05:19] everybody needs a preacher
[1:05:23] even preachers need preachers
[1:05:25] for it's the perfecting of the saints so
[1:05:27] we all come to the
[1:05:30] the to the to the stature of the
[1:05:32] fullness of christ that's what the bible
[1:05:34] says now so so here we see this order
[1:05:37] coming down from god to the prophet from
[1:05:40] the prophet to the ministry from the
[1:05:41] ministry to the people and this is the
[1:05:44] ordinance of the law
[1:05:45] which the lord hath commanded saying
[1:05:47] speak to the children of israel that
[1:05:49] they bring me a red heifer without spot
[1:05:52] wherein is no blemish and upon which
[1:05:55] never came yoke now each one of these
[1:05:58] brother brown said
[1:05:59] speak expressly of christ
[1:06:02] these are all type shadow
[1:06:05] uh uh scriptures that deal from old
[1:06:07] testament shadow or type to the modern
[1:06:11] era antitype everything is fulfilled in
[1:06:13] christ
[1:06:14] and in the church now
[1:06:16] this is going to move forward we're
[1:06:18] going to read a little bit of scripture
[1:06:19] here so you just follow with me and i'll
[1:06:20] try to uh go quickly i paid forward this
[1:06:23] morning i i didn't preach very long this
[1:06:25] morning so i maybe give me a little bit
[1:06:27] on the backside this evening now
[1:06:30] and you shall give her to eloise of the
[1:06:32] priests that he may bring her forth
[1:06:34] without the camp and one shall say slay
[1:06:37] her before his face and elies of the
[1:06:40] priest shall take of her blood with his
[1:06:43] finger and sprinkle her brother directly
[1:06:45] before the tabernacle of the
[1:06:46] congregation seven times now each one of
[1:06:49] these speaks of when you see this seven
[1:06:52] times brother brown goes back and picks
[1:06:54] those up and says it speaks of the seven
[1:06:55] ages and how that there would be grace
[1:06:57] in all seven ages now it goes on he said
[1:07:00] and one shall burn the heifer in his
[1:07:02] sight her skin and her flesh and her
[1:07:04] blood and her dung
[1:07:05] shall he burn and the priest shall take
[1:07:07] the cedar wood and the hyssop and each
[1:07:08] one of these remember has types the
[1:07:11] cedarwood
[1:07:13] speaking of calvary and the hyssop
[1:07:16] speaking of faith and scarlet and each
[1:07:19] one of these having a an application and
[1:07:22] cast it in the midst of the burning of
[1:07:24] the heifer now the heifer itself
[1:07:27] represented
[1:07:28] christ and he goes on here to say that a
[1:07:30] man with uh that is clean shall gather
[1:07:33] up the ashes of the heifer lay them
[1:07:35] without the camp in a clean place and it
[1:07:37] shall be kept for the congregation of
[1:07:39] the children of israel this is what it's
[1:07:41] for
[1:07:42] for a water of separation it is a
[1:07:46] purification
[1:07:47] for sin now this is the scripture where
[1:07:50] brother branham makes reference to the
[1:07:52] thinking man's filter
[1:07:54] is that right and so from this thinking
[1:07:56] man's filter is the separation of sin so
[1:08:00] what was what what filters water but
[1:08:03] charcoal is that right and so water
[1:08:05] poured through ashes comes
[1:08:08] forth as in it's the only place in the
[1:08:10] bible where it speaks of holy water now
[1:08:14] then this this holy water or this water
[1:08:17] of the separation it is a purification
[1:08:20] for sin now there's a lot of things that
[1:08:22] we could go back to but it was to
[1:08:24] identify one of the things it was to do
[1:08:25] was to identify
[1:08:27] a a woman who had been either true to
[1:08:31] her husband or had been
[1:08:34] untrue to her husband and she would have
[1:08:36] to drink of that water mixed with dust
[1:08:39] and that was one of the things that
[1:08:40] would prove whether or not uh she was
[1:08:43] had been true or not and that's a
[1:08:45] message in itself but but we see that
[1:08:48] this these types are going forward here
[1:08:51] and i just want to get to this one place
[1:08:53] that brother brown picks this up
[1:08:55] he says now this heifer
[1:08:57] was to be a distinguished
[1:09:00] heifer
[1:09:01] or one different
[1:09:03] it was to be a heifer that was red in
[1:09:06] color
[1:09:07] without one spot on it now there's been
[1:09:09] a lot of time spent on preaching of the
[1:09:12] red heifer and and how they literally
[1:09:15] have to comb this
[1:09:16] this bovine
[1:09:18] from head to toe
[1:09:21] and they if there's one gray or black
[1:09:24] hair that they find it's disqualified
[1:09:28] so it's quite a quite an ordeal and so
[1:09:31] it takes years to find this one heifer
[1:09:34] that they can use for the ashes uh that
[1:09:37] this in its ashes but they were there
[1:09:39] you see they're looking
[1:09:41] after a natural
[1:09:43] animal to fulfill
[1:09:45] an old testament law but what they
[1:09:47] failed to recognize was that this heifer
[1:09:49] has already come
[1:09:51] and that that heifer was fulfilled in
[1:09:53] christ amen he became our red heifer a
[1:09:57] separation
[1:09:59] from sin now but brother branham puts in
[1:10:01] some really neat notations here
[1:10:05] now all those had things and had a
[1:10:08] significance to them
[1:10:10] they had a meaning every little detail
[1:10:15] had a meaning
[1:10:19] what they meant to those people in the
[1:10:21] type
[1:10:22] what ought it mean to us in the antitype
[1:10:27] that right
[1:10:29] what they've done with it there under
[1:10:31] the law
[1:10:33] what could we do
[1:10:35] under it with it today
[1:10:38] under the baptism of the holy ghost or
[1:10:41] the holy spirit see
[1:10:43] if they had the shadow
[1:10:46] we got the positive c
[1:10:49] they had the negative
[1:10:51] we got the positive
[1:10:53] they had the picture in a negative
[1:10:57] we've got it
[1:10:58] in a positive
[1:11:01] after
[1:11:02] it's been developed at calvary amen
[1:11:06] this is what i want to get you to
[1:11:08] and we
[1:11:09] went to calvary with the lamb
[1:11:14] so you see even though you look at me
[1:11:17] and i look at you and we look around us
[1:11:18] and we see the negative
[1:11:21] but yet when you look at it through the
[1:11:23] eyes of calvary when you look at it
[1:11:26] through the eyes of christ that we went
[1:11:29] there with him the bible says amen that
[1:11:31] when he left the earth that he went unto
[1:11:34] the father what bearing precious seed
[1:11:38] hallelujah and he shall come again
[1:11:41] and bring his sheaves with him mature
[1:11:44] seed hallelujah
[1:11:46] so he took us in the infancy he
[1:11:49] impregnated us at calvary what does the
[1:11:52] bee do brother bam talks about the
[1:11:54] pollen and the pistols in the church age
[1:11:55] book you know what i'm talking about and
[1:11:57] so the flower there what is it but then
[1:11:59] what does that be of death do that be of
[1:12:02] death comes it begins to trump down the
[1:12:04] little flower and when the bee is done
[1:12:06] with a flower it's bruised
[1:12:09] it's marred
[1:12:10] amen
[1:12:12] it's it's bones staring at him
[1:12:14] hallelujah he's broken down but what did
[1:12:17] he do he didn't he done it a favor the
[1:12:20] be of death what did it do but it pushed
[1:12:23] amen those pollens down into the pistols
[1:12:26] which goes down inside the seed it dies
[1:12:29] goes into the grave is buried but what
[1:12:32] it comes up again in resurrection
[1:12:35] oh you see what happened when the bee of
[1:12:37] death was stinging the lord jesus
[1:12:39] brother said he stuck his stinger in too
[1:12:42] far and he pulled out a stinger but what
[1:12:44] did it do it it it caused amen that that
[1:12:49] that
[1:12:50] lord jesus now he now has pregnant seed
[1:12:54] within him
[1:12:55] he goes down into the grave
[1:12:58] smites the devil in the face with your
[1:13:00] sins
[1:13:00] rises up triumphantly on easter morning
[1:13:03] ascends unto god taking you with him i
[1:13:07] was i was
[1:13:09] crucified buried went to hell with my
[1:13:12] savior my sins were paid in him and i
[1:13:17] rose up on easter morning amen now i am
[1:13:21] waiting for the change of my body
[1:13:25] oh think about it
[1:13:28] amen
[1:13:31] so we went through the acids
[1:13:34] we went through we got the positive
[1:13:36] after it's been developed at calvary
[1:13:39] and we went to calvary
[1:13:41] with the lamb
[1:13:44] just like snapping a picture you're the
[1:13:46] negative
[1:13:48] any negative has to go to the dark room
[1:13:51] through acids
[1:13:52] to develop the picture
[1:13:55] to make you see what it is
[1:13:58] we
[1:13:59] are
[1:14:00] now
[1:14:02] in the express image of him
[1:14:06] not this guy
[1:14:08] not the outside man
[1:14:10] i'm the express image of a
[1:14:13] of a train wreck
[1:14:16] huh
[1:14:17] i'm the express image of an adulterous
[1:14:20] affair by a man and a woman born
[1:14:22] illegitimately
[1:14:24] i'm just i'm just a i'm just a
[1:14:27] in my flesh
[1:14:29] how we're just
[1:14:31] we're an accident looking for a place to
[1:14:33] happen
[1:14:37] but according but because
[1:14:39] through christ
[1:14:41] i went to calvary
[1:14:44] and went through the acids
[1:14:46] to be developed
[1:14:48] to make us see what it is
[1:14:50] so once i go to calvary by faith and i
[1:14:53] resurrect with him when i look in the
[1:14:56] mirror through the perfect law of
[1:14:57] liberty i see a redeemed son of god
[1:15:01] hallelujah
[1:15:03] the express image of him
[1:15:06] it's the negative has been taken
[1:15:09] we're human life
[1:15:11] but we must go into the dark room down
[1:15:13] into the grave to go through the
[1:15:14] developing to come back in the uh
[1:15:17] back forth in the image oh my young
[1:15:20] forever
[1:15:22] come on old people time to shout this
[1:15:25] this evening
[1:15:26] young forever and all the old age and
[1:15:30] all the defects and everything will be
[1:15:32] taken away
[1:15:35] as job said in my appointed time i'm
[1:15:38] waiting for my change to come
[1:15:41] hallelujah
[1:15:42] now
[1:15:44] speaking of the red heifer again
[1:15:47] now she was killed without the camp and
[1:15:50] eliezer i can't stand behind this desk
[1:15:51] very easy
[1:15:53] i really like these big words i don't
[1:15:55] have to have my readers on
[1:15:58] hey man let's let me get down here
[1:16:02] in my notes here so i can
[1:16:04] read this a little bit
[1:16:06] oh my where am i
[1:16:09] this might go faster than you thought
[1:16:12] now
[1:16:14] yes
[1:16:15] and now she was killed without the camp
[1:16:19] and eliezer
[1:16:23] had to watch
[1:16:25] her being killed and then
[1:16:27] when she was dead he had to get the
[1:16:29] blood and stripe it upon the door of the
[1:16:31] tabernacle seven times showing that it
[1:16:33] was a public testimony before the people
[1:16:36] that an innocent substitute had to die
[1:16:38] for a guilty victim
[1:16:40] a public testimony to everyone who
[1:16:42] passed that way knowed that they were
[1:16:44] coming under the blood of an innocent
[1:16:45] substitute for their sins thank you lord
[1:16:47] jesus
[1:16:49] and when she was burned and all her
[1:16:50] ashes was to be gathered up and put in a
[1:16:53] clean place watch outside the tabernacle
[1:16:55] in a clean place
[1:16:57] a clean place for it was the water
[1:17:00] of separation or the purification
[1:17:03] from sin now
[1:17:06] we read there in the scripture i want to
[1:17:08] just see this
[1:17:12] we'll back up one
[1:17:14] so it had to be taken to a clean place
[1:17:17] and it had to be
[1:17:19] picked up and gathered
[1:17:22] by a man that was clean with clean hands
[1:17:26] now we understand that that was eliezer
[1:17:29] or one that represented the ministry
[1:17:33] and so we find that in the day and the
[1:17:35] hour that we live in
[1:17:38] that everybody that's anybody it doesn't
[1:17:40] matter man woman married divorced this
[1:17:44] that the other
[1:17:45] everybody thinks that they're called to
[1:17:46] be a preacher
[1:17:49] i got a guy that i just talked to the
[1:17:51] other day because he went through i
[1:17:53] think it was wilkerson's uh
[1:17:56] teen challenge and they ordained him as
[1:17:58] a minister
[1:18:00] divorced man
[1:18:03] but i mean and you know
[1:18:06] there are several of those i've run
[1:18:07] across oh there was one i talked to the
[1:18:09] other day he did a correspondence course
[1:18:12] online
[1:18:13] and became an ordained minister
[1:18:18] but yet he smoked he cussed he he does
[1:18:21] drugs he's he does all these kind of
[1:18:23] things and i'm saying but what about the
[1:18:27] clean hands
[1:18:29] the one the other day living in
[1:18:31] full-blown adultery
[1:18:34] standing there preaching testifying
[1:18:36] doing all these things
[1:18:38] what are we talking about here we're
[1:18:40] talking about a
[1:18:42] ministry according to the word of god
[1:18:45] that will that will that will preach the
[1:18:47] gospel to us to lead us all into the
[1:18:51] perfection of
[1:18:52] saints to perfection clean hands
[1:18:56] friends we've got to understand that
[1:18:58] this ministry amen is dripping with
[1:19:01] blood
[1:19:02] blood of apostles blood of martyrs
[1:19:06] down to the ages brethren tells us your
[1:19:08] life must be worthy of the gospel
[1:19:12] not ministers that have been married
[1:19:15] deacons that have been married two three
[1:19:17] times living in all kinds of sin he said
[1:19:20] their lives are not worthy of the gospel
[1:19:23] nor are the people who support that
[1:19:27] are you with me this evening i'm not
[1:19:29] being mean i'm just trying to protect
[1:19:32] the people
[1:19:33] that they've got to be clean hands it's
[1:19:36] got to be offered in a cl i can take you
[1:19:38] thinking man's filter brother deals with
[1:19:40] this extensively
[1:19:42] i'm not making this up this is not
[1:19:44] brother dale's opinions
[1:19:46] not here to preach my opinions amen i
[1:19:48] heard it from a prophet who heard it
[1:19:50] from god
[1:19:52] and he said what a minister should marry
[1:19:55] and how he should be married and how
[1:19:57] what kind of wife that he should have
[1:19:58] and he said the unchanging god said so
[1:20:02] that's not my opinion
[1:20:05] and so here this this this red heifer
[1:20:08] what does it speak of it speaks of the
[1:20:11] bleeding word
[1:20:12] it speaks of the revealed message of the
[1:20:15] hour that's that that now is being
[1:20:17] expressed to the people
[1:20:19] and so when we preach these things we
[1:20:22] can't come with our own interpretation
[1:20:24] or our own opinions
[1:20:27] they have to be the word of god
[1:20:30] and that man has to stand there
[1:20:33] because he'll be judged at the end
[1:20:39] it's a frightful place to stand
[1:20:42] behind the desk
[1:20:46] and when we look at christ you see the
[1:20:48] penalty
[1:20:50] the only one
[1:20:55] whatever
[1:21:01] broke
[1:21:06] well
[1:21:08] ordinary thing
[1:21:10] i'll look at this one then
[1:21:13] when we look at christ the only one god
[1:21:16] himself made flesh
[1:21:18] god coming to the earth
[1:21:20] and took upon him the sin
[1:21:23] of us all
[1:21:25] and judgment
[1:21:28] oh i just i just want to read this
[1:21:37] judgment and wrath of almighty god was
[1:21:39] poured out upon his body
[1:21:42] and there it was riven at the cross
[1:21:46] that's the real
[1:21:48] judgment
[1:21:50] that's your judgment that's the only
[1:21:52] judgment that you will ever
[1:21:54] realize as a believer
[1:21:57] judgment
[1:21:58] first must begin at the house of the
[1:22:00] lord
[1:22:02] what happens at the house of the lord
[1:22:03] wherever that might be that's where you
[1:22:06] see yourself judged in christ
[1:22:08] that's the real judgment
[1:22:11] he tread the wine press of the wrath of
[1:22:13] god alone
[1:22:14] alone
[1:22:15] he walked the road alone
[1:22:18] he died and not no help from an angel
[1:22:22] from a man from his church
[1:22:25] from his mother from his brethren from
[1:22:28] his father
[1:22:30] forsaken by god
[1:22:32] man
[1:22:34] nature
[1:22:36] think about it oh brother brown tells a
[1:22:39] story of that little robin
[1:22:41] that little robin went down there saw
[1:22:43] him dying on the tree went down tried to
[1:22:46] pull the nails and bloodied his little
[1:22:48] breasts and that's how he become a
[1:22:50] red-breasted robin
[1:22:52] he said you leave my
[1:22:53] robins alone you boys
[1:23:01] forsaken he died alone to show us that
[1:23:03] even nature itself can't help us
[1:23:06] in the hour of death
[1:23:08] there's no friend no priest
[1:23:11] no pope no pastor
[1:23:13] it's death
[1:23:15] but there was one who took it for us
[1:23:25] so here brother brown now picks up the
[1:23:27] uh the uh
[1:23:29] the the brass serpent
[1:23:33] he said speaking of the brass servant
[1:23:34] says there are no life
[1:23:36] in the serpent it was absolutely
[1:23:38] crystallized
[1:23:42] he said that was the penalty he died
[1:23:44] until the earth got ashamed of itself he
[1:23:47] died until the stars got ashamed he
[1:23:49] suffered until the sun wouldn't shine
[1:23:53] he suffered till the moon turned off its
[1:23:55] lights he suffered till even the
[1:23:58] elements of the earth was so black and
[1:24:00] dark until it was midnight so dark you
[1:24:03] could feel it
[1:24:05] wasn't nothing no one's ever suffered
[1:24:07] like that
[1:24:09] or could suffer like that
[1:24:11] there's no mortal could
[1:24:13] could go through it but he suffered it
[1:24:16] and god laid upon him iniquity of us all
[1:24:19] and passed his judgments upon him and he
[1:24:23] treaded the wide press of the wrath of
[1:24:24] god alone
[1:24:26] with no help
[1:24:29] there was nothing to help him
[1:24:32] god placed the penalty everything was
[1:24:35] under that penalty and nothing could
[1:24:37] help him because we're all guilty
[1:24:40] there's no high priest could have come
[1:24:41] and helped him there was nothing could
[1:24:43] help him no pope no angel everything
[1:24:45] stood back and watched it
[1:24:48] that was the greatest moments
[1:24:51] was ever in the history of the world
[1:24:54] he died until there was not one drop of
[1:24:57] life left in him
[1:25:00] become like the brass serpent just a
[1:25:03] crystallized ornament
[1:25:05] hanging on the cross
[1:25:09] nobody can express
[1:25:11] that suffering
[1:25:13] like that
[1:25:15] but i i just when i read these things i
[1:25:18] think of
[1:25:19] the helplessness
[1:25:21] the suffering till even the nature
[1:25:23] itself the sun darkened in the middle of
[1:25:27] the day so dark you could feel it
[1:25:29] crystallized no life left in him hanging
[1:25:33] there the judgments of us all laid upon
[1:25:36] him but what happened that the life that
[1:25:39] was in christ when the blood cell broke
[1:25:42] there on calvary that that life then
[1:25:44] that zoe that we talked about this
[1:25:46] morning that zoe life then was then
[1:25:50] was released from god because god had
[1:25:53] held himself amen by his own power into
[1:25:57] the body of flesh called the lord jesus
[1:26:00] but when that price of perpetuation had
[1:26:03] been paid amen and redemptions uh uh uh
[1:26:07] a penalty had been paid that it released
[1:26:10] god from his own law then to come back
[1:26:14] according to the scripture and come back
[1:26:16] on the day of pentecost and that's why
[1:26:19] peter can say this is that amen that was
[1:26:22] prophesied by the prophet joel amen upon
[1:26:26] uh upon all flesh i'll pour out my
[1:26:28] spirit and so they were the recipients
[1:26:31] amen of the price that had been paid
[1:26:33] that the life that was in christ amen
[1:26:36] could come back on them the deity of god
[1:26:39] could now dwell in human beings
[1:26:42] and they could be the sons of god the
[1:26:44] bible said for he hath given us the
[1:26:46] power to be called the sons of god
[1:26:50] hallelujah
[1:26:52] and so now then we come to this place
[1:26:56] amen hanging there on the cross
[1:27:00] oh i like this but not only that
[1:27:03] but in his death he suffered a death
[1:27:06] like no one ever suffered
[1:27:08] never in man ever suffered with such a
[1:27:11] broken heart
[1:27:13] till his blood and water separated
[1:27:16] before his death now this is a twofold
[1:27:19] prophecy that had to be done because the
[1:27:21] scripture says amen that it was that
[1:27:24] there that it talks about how that it
[1:27:26] was
[1:27:27] in order for life to come that there had
[1:27:29] to be all three elements is that right
[1:27:33] water blood and spirit
[1:27:36] so here the three had to be separated
[1:27:39] from the body of christ so that you and
[1:27:41] i could come under new birth the new
[1:27:44] birth process had to be paid for in full
[1:27:48] by suffering and so he had to suffer to
[1:27:51] the fullness in order to pay for amen
[1:27:54] your new birth and so then he brought
[1:27:57] forth water
[1:27:58] amen justification
[1:28:00] blood sanctification to bring forth a
[1:28:04] birth amen the spirit of god the baptism
[1:28:07] coming back upon the believer
[1:28:09] this is and he actually preached this in
[1:28:11] the message perfection now
[1:28:16] we move down almost to the close here
[1:28:20] he said from the richest to the poorest
[1:28:25] from the most blessed to the most
[1:28:27] horrible suffering
[1:28:29] and then besides that went down into the
[1:28:32] very lowest depths of the lowest hell
[1:28:35] bearing our sins
[1:28:37] listen to what he says here
[1:28:39] and he got this end of the string or the
[1:28:42] end of the rope
[1:28:44] from the kink
[1:28:46] and there he lifted it up in
[1:28:48] resurrection
[1:28:51] and connected it with the other part of
[1:28:54] eternity
[1:28:56] and made a highway of holiness
[1:28:59] that the unclean could come on
[1:29:02] and be cleansed
[1:29:04] this is a striking statement to me
[1:29:09] first of all in the previous quote
[1:29:11] brother man makes this statement he says
[1:29:14] that he suffered like none other
[1:29:17] no man could suffer that where was
[1:29:19] brother brahm pulling this inspiration
[1:29:21] from
[1:29:22] that the bible says that his visage
[1:29:26] was marred more than any other man
[1:29:30] now i'm not here to be contradictory to
[1:29:32] the bible
[1:29:34] but there were men in the bible that
[1:29:36] were fed to dogs
[1:29:39] they were they were eaten by lions they
[1:29:41] were their visage was marred to the
[1:29:44] point of being the draught of the
[1:29:46] animals
[1:29:49] jesus and i'm not saying just but i'm
[1:29:51] just saying he was still intact not a
[1:29:53] bone was broken
[1:29:55] and so you say but but it said that his
[1:29:57] visage was marred more than any other
[1:29:59] man
[1:30:00] and so i'm here to tell you how
[1:30:03] because it wasn't just speaking of the
[1:30:05] physical visage
[1:30:08] visage actually goes beyond the physical
[1:30:11] form into the personality
[1:30:14] goes into the spirit realm visage is
[1:30:16] your expression
[1:30:18] your countenance
[1:30:20] are you with me it's your expression
[1:30:23] it's more than that so his expression or
[1:30:26] his visage his spirit
[1:30:28] was marred more than any other man how
[1:30:31] is that possible because sin of the
[1:30:34] world was laid upon him
[1:30:37] no other man ever bore that weight
[1:30:41] and that weight crushed him in the
[1:30:44] spirit realm he suffered more than any
[1:30:47] other man because he was more than a man
[1:30:52] so he could he could suffer more he
[1:30:55] could bear more he could be more he
[1:30:58] could take it all
[1:31:00] the bible says amen for they looked all
[1:31:03] through heaven and all through the earth
[1:31:05] and under the earth and above the earth
[1:31:07] to find one who was worthy amen to open
[1:31:11] the book and there was none worthy
[1:31:14] there was none worthy oh but then john
[1:31:17] began to weep and the angel said don't
[1:31:20] weep john for one has been found
[1:31:23] hallelujah the lion of the tribe of
[1:31:26] judah amen is worthy to take the book
[1:31:29] how was it because he was more than a
[1:31:31] man
[1:31:32] he suffered in every way like a man he
[1:31:35] was tempted in every way like a man but
[1:31:38] he was logos
[1:31:41] he was god he was he was everything
[1:31:44] and all things and he could carry atlas
[1:31:47] amen was a pimp squeak
[1:31:50] atlas couldn't carry anything amen but
[1:31:54] jesus christ bore the sins
[1:31:56] of the world
[1:32:00] the word worthiness there speaks of
[1:32:02] weight
[1:32:04] it speaks of a balance
[1:32:07] our sins had tipped the scales
[1:32:10] and there was no man that could tip them
[1:32:12] back
[1:32:13] to pay the price
[1:32:15] but when jesus stepped out
[1:32:17] amen
[1:32:18] because he was more than a man
[1:32:21] amen so he was worthy he could step on
[1:32:23] the scales tip the scales and then take
[1:32:26] the book
[1:32:28] amen and loose the seals
[1:32:32] and hand the book down to his messenger
[1:32:35] and the messenger handed it down to john
[1:32:38] and said john eat the book
[1:32:41] and so john ate the book and it was
[1:32:43] bitter
[1:32:44] in his belly
[1:32:46] sweet in his mouth he said now go
[1:32:48] prophesy again
[1:32:50] amen
[1:32:52] and so we come here
[1:32:54] from the richest to the poorest
[1:32:57] from the most blessed to the most
[1:32:58] horrible suffering
[1:33:00] and then besides that he went down into
[1:33:02] the lowest depths of the lowest hell
[1:33:03] bearing our sins and got the end of the
[1:33:04] string
[1:33:06] think about it friends that that
[1:33:09] eternity
[1:33:11] had been upset
[1:33:13] in the garden of eden
[1:33:15] because until then it was an eternal
[1:33:17] ring it couldn't be broken
[1:33:19] but then because of disobedience through
[1:33:22] the original sin through the fall in the
[1:33:23] garden the end of the eternal string
[1:33:26] fell down
[1:33:27] and went down into hell and it was
[1:33:29] hanging there and it had been hanging
[1:33:30] there for all of man's history
[1:33:33] but when christ comes he then descends
[1:33:37] down into the lowest hell bearing our
[1:33:39] sins and got the end of the string
[1:33:43] oh think about that because our eternal
[1:33:46] life rested upon that very act
[1:33:49] because if he did not accomplish that
[1:33:52] act then the eternal ring would have
[1:33:54] been broken and then there the scripture
[1:33:56] would have been broken and the
[1:33:58] they would all been lost and that's why
[1:34:00] that's why john was weeping if there was
[1:34:03] no man found worthy then we were all
[1:34:05] lost brother ram said amen so then what
[1:34:08] happened he come up out of death and
[1:34:11] hell and he stopped by paradise and he
[1:34:14] knocked on the door and adam opened the
[1:34:17] door
[1:34:19] and when he looked out he saw it he said
[1:34:21] oh look it's the one we had fellowship
[1:34:24] in the cool of the evening come on eve
[1:34:26] and he started up and she reached back
[1:34:29] and she
[1:34:30] shook abel and abel said oh it's the one
[1:34:32] that i saw amen it was my lamb that i
[1:34:35] offered and i died on the same rock
[1:34:37] hallelujah hey man he reached down and
[1:34:40] grabbed seth who rose up in the
[1:34:42] resurrection amen was a very type of
[1:34:44] resurrection seth reached back amen god
[1:34:47] noah noah reached back amen god abraham
[1:34:50] abraham reached back amen what did he do
[1:34:53] he brought up isaac and jacob amen and
[1:34:56] joseph and they were coming up one after
[1:34:58] us said lift up your gates you
[1:35:00] everlasting days
[1:35:02] hallelujah and let the king of glory
[1:35:04] come in and christ jesus was leading the
[1:35:07] way to bring the rope back and tie it
[1:35:10] back into eternity and now all that
[1:35:12] believe upon him having eternal life
[1:35:15] through christ who strengthens us
[1:35:19] amen and made a highway
[1:35:21] of holiness
[1:35:23] amen
[1:35:25] so we can all
[1:35:28] go to heaven
[1:35:36] my

[1:35:50] where
[1:35:51] would i be
