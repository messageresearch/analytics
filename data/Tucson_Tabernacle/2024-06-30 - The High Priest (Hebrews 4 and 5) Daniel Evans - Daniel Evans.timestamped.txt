[25:36] wanted some of the acts of the prophets
[25:38] books and and while brother Jordan and I
[25:40] were back there looking um for the books
[25:44] I found I saw this book right here and
[25:49] it's titled footprints on the sands of
[25:51] time and it was originally published uh
[25:56] by Spoken Word Publications I believe
[25:58] that brother Roy borders is the one that
[26:00] put it together and uh it's it's really
[26:04] a it's really a neat book it's just a
[26:06] it's a um compilation of
[26:10] sermons and uh and then it has some
[26:13] different topics in here and and some
[26:15] different quotes and just some different
[26:17] tracks that spoken word put out it's
[26:20] it's really just a it's it's a neat
[26:22] little book um it's a bit obsolete now
[26:26] because we have software and we have an
[26:28] app that we can just look this stuff up
[26:30] but um it it brought back it brought
[26:33] back some really good memories for me
[26:36] this book I met a man and I've given a
[26:38] testimony about him his name is Don
[26:40] Marsh he was a prisoner for many years
[26:44] um in prison for violent crimes and um
[26:48] he uh drug addict heavy drug user he was
[26:52] he was Airborne in the Army and uh they
[26:55] named his um platoon or I don't know
[26:59] what you call it his group they named
[27:01] him the jumping
[27:02] junkies because they were heroin users
[27:06] heavy heroin users and uh he ended up um
[27:11] assaulting someone going to prison
[27:14] getting out doing it again going back to
[27:16] prison and one day he
[27:19] was just contemplating on on life in
[27:23] general he's in prison and they had a
[27:27] library
[27:28] in uh in the prison there and he uh he
[27:32] looked up and he saw this book sitting
[27:36] on the shelf and it was sticking out a
[27:38] little bit it it was it didn't look like
[27:41] it belonged there so he went and he
[27:45] picked this book up and he started
[27:49] reading it and that began the change in
[27:54] brother Don's life he ended up
[27:58] giving his heart to the Lord Jesus in
[28:00] prison I believe he got baptized in
[28:03] prison he um got out and um he was uh he
[28:10] was there for I don't know a few months
[28:13] in
[28:14] Jeffersonville and I kept uh I walked
[28:18] out of church one day and I I saw him
[28:19] there and if you know me I don't like to
[28:22] have any strangers in church I I I I
[28:25] want to meet everybody and it's not just
[28:27] because I'm Pastor I've always been that
[28:29] way and I saw him standing there so I
[28:33] walked up to him and he was leaning up
[28:35] against the wall and nobody talking with
[28:37] him because I guess he had a reputation
[28:39] and the people knew who he was and uh I
[28:43] walked up to him I shook his hand and
[28:45] and I said hey I've seen you I said I
[28:47] wanted to introduce myself and and he
[28:49] said he says he had the best voice he
[28:53] used to sing me songs and leave them on
[28:55] my voicemail um Stephanie used to get a
[28:58] kick I don't listen to Brother Don
[29:00] singing on my voicemail but uh he said
[29:03] brother he says nobody talks to
[29:07] me and I said something on the order of
[29:10] well so you're calling me a
[29:13] nobody and he said no no he says no man
[29:17] he goes I've done
[29:20] time brother Jer Jeremiah I didn't know
[29:22] what that meant when he said it so I was
[29:26] like what
[29:28] and he says no he says I I I've been in
[29:30] prison and and he says he says nobody
[29:32] wants to talk to me and I said well
[29:34] brother I'd like to get to know you so
[29:36] that was the beginning of of a just a
[29:38] wonderful friendship between Brother Don
[29:41] and I and he ended up just he ended up
[29:45] being just a wonderful person and he
[29:48] ended up dying of liver cancer from all
[29:51] of those years of of abusing his body
[29:53] with alcohol and drugs and um I just got
[29:57] to say say he's one of those people that
[29:59] when they go on you know you miss him
[30:02] and I miss Brother Don he's probably
[30:04] been uh I don't know five or six years
[30:07] since he passed away but he was truly a
[30:10] testimony of God's grace he was the
[30:13] worst of the worst
[30:15] violent
[30:17] belligerent um drug using criminal and
[30:22] God changed
[30:23] him and it was this book right here was
[30:27] the St of his change so when brother
[30:29] Jordan and I were back there looking and
[30:31] I saw this book I just thought you know
[30:33] I'd like to tell the church about that
[30:37] testimony I uh I had a nice day we had
[30:41] lunch lunch with brother Wesley there
[30:43] and um some of the some of the Brethren
[30:46] and um I was uh before we went to lunch
[30:50] I was talking with brother Kevin sister
[30:53] Connie Cary and I just
[30:58] every person I just appreciate this
[31:00] whole congregation so much everyone has
[31:04] tremendous
[31:05] strengths and I was talking with sister
[31:09] Connie and and we were
[31:13] just fellowshipping about how the Lord
[31:16] can use each one of us and he can lay
[31:20] things on our heart to allow us to maybe
[31:24] enter into the suffering of someone else
[31:28] I was just in the back praying for my
[31:31] son Daniel I've had a toothache before
[31:34] and it's an awful awful thing so I was
[31:37] able to enter into that suffering with
[31:38] him and and pray for him and it's not
[31:42] just because I love him but it's because
[31:43] I've been there and that's Jacob that's
[31:46] what I was talking about this morning is
[31:48] the Lord Jesus how he can enter into our
[31:53] suffering because he's been there and he
[31:56] he knows how it is is to for people to
[31:59] talk bad about you he knows how it is
[32:03] for the enemy to come into your mind and
[32:07] try to poison your thoughts because he's
[32:10] been there he was tempted in the
[32:12] wilderness for when he fasted for 40
[32:15] days Satan came to him was trying to get
[32:18] in his head Satan even tried to get him
[32:20] to commit suicide to jump off the temple
[32:24] so Jesus knows how it is he knows how it
[32:26] is to get down he knows how it is to AR
[32:29] arue to feel like you want to argue with
[32:31] someone he he he's been there and yet
[32:33] we're going to read in the book of
[32:35] Hebrews yet he was without
[32:38] sin he was he was great Jacob he's my
[32:43] hero he's you know we look at when we're
[32:47] growing up and and we're looking at
[32:48] athletes and we're looking at famous
[32:50] people and and and all these these Great
[32:54] Men I never had any Heroes there I I
[32:56] always um liked the the superheroes you
[33:01] know and the AC action figures and all
[33:03] that when I was little but now I see
[33:06] that they are all just a copy of Jesus
[33:09] Christ he is the
[33:13] superhero he is awesome Not only was he
[33:18] did he have like Powers unlimited Powers
[33:22] which is that is so neat but he also had
[33:26] compassion he was a hero he he he had
[33:30] love and he he he could he could help
[33:33] somebody when they're really down they
[33:34] could come to him like Mary magdalin did
[33:36] and he just had a way just to make it
[33:38] all go
[33:40] away so much so that all of my sins and
[33:44] all of I I have committed in my life he
[33:46] just sister Debbie just W wiped it right
[33:49] away I'm so happy I'm just so thankful
[33:53] that he could do that I I think about
[33:56] look at this book when I think about
[33:58] that man Don Marsh big giant
[34:02] intimidating guy and yet he got to come
[34:07] into the presence of Jesus Christ at his
[34:10] death no matter how bad he was no matter
[34:13] what he had done and I would venture to
[34:16] bet that he had done far worse than
[34:18] anyone in this building right now and
[34:20] yet Jesus Christ was able to save that
[34:25] man and to bring him into his presence
[34:27] and when he died he was glorifying God
[34:33] uh Daniel and I would go visit him on
[34:35] his on his deathbed and and the guy just
[34:38] loved Jesus he he was he was just so
[34:42] happy we were talk about doctrinal stuff
[34:45] and he'd he'd say brother I just don't
[34:48] know where all this is coming from can't
[34:50] we just focus on God I was like yes amen
[34:55] he he just he had it
[34:58] I um I just miss that guy so much he was
[35:01] he was really really a special person
[35:03] let's um I have a fairly short message
[35:06] tonight we will finish up with
[35:09] um Hebrews chapter 4 and then we I think
[35:12] we can get through chapter 5 tonight so
[35:15] I read part of chapter 4 this
[35:18] morning so let's start with uh let's
[35:22] just go ahead and start with with verse
[35:24] one and um I believe stopped on on verse
[35:28] 5 so then we will um we'll we'll go on
[35:32] with verse 6 through the end but let's
[35:34] start with verse one it
[35:36] says
[35:38] this let us
[35:42] fear let us therefore fear lest a
[35:45] promise being left us of entering into
[35:48] his rest any of you should she seem to
[35:51] come short of it for unto us was the
[35:54] Gospel preached as well as unto them but
[35:56] the word preached did not profit them
[35:59] not being mixed with faith in them that
[36:01] heard it for we which have believed do
[36:05] enter into rest as he said as I have
[36:07] sworn in my wrath if they shall enter
[36:10] into my rest although the works were
[36:13] finished from the foundation of the
[36:16] world for he spake in a certain place of
[36:19] the seventh day on this wise and God did
[36:22] rest the seventh day from all his works
[36:25] and in this place again
[36:28] if they shall enter into my rest again
[36:32] he's quoting Psalm 95 there and let's
[36:35] continue on to verse six it says this
[36:39] seeing therefore it remaineth that some
[36:41] must enter therein and they to whom it
[36:44] was first preached entered not in
[36:48] because of unbelief let me read the um I
[36:52] believe it's it's the Amplified version
[36:54] of the of verse six
[36:57] therefore since the promise remains for
[36:59] some to enter his rest and those who
[37:02] formerly had the good news preached to
[37:05] them failed to grasp it and did not
[37:08] enter because of their their unbelief
[37:12] evidenced by
[37:15] Disobedience so it shows
[37:18] that that the evidence of our unbelief
[37:23] is our sins and is our Disobedience
[37:27] again he limith a certain day saying in
[37:29] David today after so long a time as it
[37:32] is said today if you will hear his voice
[37:36] Harden not your heart so again he sets a
[37:39] definite day it's a new day today
[37:43] providing another opportunity to enter
[37:46] into that rest saying through David
[37:49] after so long a time just as has been
[37:52] said before in the words that were
[37:55] already quoted again Psalm 95
[37:58] verse eight for if Jesus had given them
[38:02] rest then would he not afterward have
[38:06] spoken of another day does that sound
[38:13] strange I heard brother Lyall Mumble it
[38:16] under his breath so it's King James so
[38:20] when he says that if Jesus had given
[38:24] them rest then would he not afterward
[38:27] word have spoken of of another day the
[38:31] the author here is talking about when
[38:33] Moses had had gone to be with the Lord
[38:36] and Joshua had taken them over into the
[38:39] promised land and the the translation as
[38:42] it comes through it was
[38:45] Joshua was has been translated as
[38:51] Jesus and really yahoshua I believe is
[38:55] the the Hebrew name for it Jesus and
[38:58] Joshua are actually the same
[39:01] name so the the the way that this is
[39:06] translated into English here it's
[39:08] actually for if Joshua had given them
[39:12] rest then would he have not afterward of
[39:15] spoken of another day remember when
[39:17] Joshua and and the children of Israel
[39:19] remember when they went over into Jordan
[39:22] they went over into the promised land
[39:24] and and God was saying that that he
[39:26] wouldn't give that first generation any
[39:29] rest he he wouldn't give them the
[39:30] promised land because they rebelled
[39:32] against him they provoked God so they
[39:34] all died out except for Joshua and Caleb
[39:37] and they bring the people over the
[39:40] Jordan River and they fight this battle
[39:44] at Jericho that is not
[39:48] rest that's not peace even though they
[39:51] went over into the promised land so what
[39:54] the author here is saying is that does
[39:56] not fulfill
[39:58] this rest of the Sabbath that was that
[40:00] was promised so they uh that was just
[40:06] filled with with problems there was it
[40:08] was ACH and sin at Jericho when he took
[40:11] the wedge of gold and then a bunch of
[40:13] they lost the battle at Ai and and it
[40:15] was just problems they were fighting
[40:16] with Giants and and then another person
[40:18] would sin and and and this was just a
[40:21] very very difficult time but yet it was
[40:23] in the promised land but there remaineth
[40:26] therefore a rest to the people of God it
[40:29] wasn't fulfilled there in the Old
[40:31] Testament for he that is entered into
[40:34] his rest he also hath ceased from his
[40:37] own works as God did from his so when
[40:41] you truly enter into the rest of God
[40:45] then you will no longer be doing your
[40:48] old works so what are the old works that
[40:52] we're talking about here there's
[40:55] sin so when you enter into God's rest
[40:59] when you are baptized into the faith
[41:01] when you are making a you are making a
[41:04] commitment that that old person that was
[41:08] here that was
[41:09] sinful changed into a new person and
[41:15] that new person is doing his best to
[41:18] serve God again my friend Don
[41:21] Marsh he was a rough one he is he is a
[41:24] great example because it's such a start
[41:27] contrast he goes and he's he's partying
[41:30] and he's he's shooting up and he's
[41:33] fighting and he's he's he's committing
[41:36] crimes and he's doing all these things
[41:38] he goes to prison he he he finds the
[41:40] Lord he he gets baptized he makes this
[41:43] commitment and now his sins are washed
[41:46] away and he's a different person he was
[41:48] very much a different person but yet he
[41:50] still
[41:51] sinned he still made mistakes but there
[41:54] was something
[41:55] different that difference was he
[41:58] repented and he was trying to be right
[42:01] and God honored that so again when we're
[42:06] baptized into the faith then we are
[42:09] making a commitment that that old person
[42:12] is changed into a new person and this
[42:15] new person is going to do his best to
[42:18] serve
[42:19] God let us labor therefore to enter into
[42:22] that rest lest any man fall after the
[42:25] same example of UN belief so sin can
[42:28] only come through unbelief if you really
[42:31] believe that there is a God and you
[42:33] really believe that he punishes sin then
[42:36] you wouldn't sin in the first place
[42:40] knowingly sin you wouldn't do it in the
[42:41] first place if you really
[42:43] believed so sin and unbelief they really
[42:46] they go hand in hand brother brandom
[42:47] even said one time he he made a
[42:49] statement actually many times he said
[42:51] that there is only one sin and that's
[42:53] unbelief and now you can see why that's
[42:55] true is because that you you wouldn't
[42:59] really do it if you knew that God was
[43:02] watching if you knew he was right there
[43:04] you knew that you would have to answer
[43:06] for this you probably wouldn't do it in
[43:09] the first place but because of a lack of
[43:13] faith then we go and we sin for the word
[43:17] of God is
[43:19] quick I like that word it means alive
[43:22] for the word of God is quick and
[43:24] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[43:26] sword piercing even to the dividing
[43:29] aunder of the Soul and Spirit of the
[43:31] joints and of the marrow and is a
[43:33] discerner of the thoughts and intense of
[43:36] the
[43:37] heart what that
[43:39] means is God can look
[43:43] down into my mind into my heart and he
[43:48] knows my motives he knows everything
[43:50] that I have done he knows all of my sins
[43:53] he knows everything about me there is
[43:57] nothing hidden before
[44:00] God and it says the word of God is is
[44:05] powerful and it's sharper than any
[44:07] two-edged sword a two-edged sword if
[44:10] it's very sharp when you when you thrust
[44:14] that sword in it cuts on both sides it
[44:18] goes it it goes smoothly in It just
[44:21] strikes right to the heart and that's
[44:25] how the word of God is and it is a
[44:28] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[44:30] the heart it knows everything and then
[44:32] in the in um John chapter one it says in
[44:35] the beginning was the word the
[44:38] discerner of the of the the thoughts and
[44:42] and the the joints and the marrow and
[44:45] the discerner of the thoughts and
[44:46] intents of the heart and it and it it's
[44:49] everything it knows everything about us
[44:51] and then it says in John chapter 1 it
[44:53] says in the beginning was the word this
[44:56] what what I just
[44:58] read and the Word was with God and the
[45:02] Word was God Amen so we know that God
[45:06] and the word they are the same thing and
[45:09] then later on in that chapter chapter I
[45:11] believe it's verse 14 it says and the
[45:13] Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[45:17] which was Jesus Christ himself neither
[45:20] is there any
[45:21] creature that is not manifested in his
[45:24] sight that's not just open in his sight
[45:26] he knows everything
[45:28] but all things are naked and open unto
[45:31] the eyes of him with
[45:33] whom we have to do English Standard
[45:37] Version says and no creature is hidden
[45:39] from his sight but all are naked and
[45:41] exposed to the eyes of him who to whom
[45:45] we must give an
[45:47] account so if we believe God is real
[45:50] then we must believe that he knows every
[45:52] sin that we commit he knows everything
[45:54] that we're doing
[45:57] and we look back and we think of that
[46:01] man that I mentioned this morning that
[46:04] was picking up
[46:07] sticks and he met his
[46:11] condemnation and if God sees that that
[46:14] sin it was pointed out God knew it was
[46:16] happening it was pointed out and there
[46:18] came to punishment but
[46:20] now if we truly accept Jesus Christ and
[46:24] that sin it it may be
[46:28] present but it becomes wiped out through
[46:31] the blood of Jesus Christ and then God
[46:33] looks down and he can't see it all he
[46:35] can see is
[46:38] Jesus it's a good testimony never
[46:40] thought about that if if God looks down
[46:42] at me and my sins and everything that
[46:45] about me and all he sees is Jesus man
[46:48] it's neat that we can look around and
[46:51] then all we can see is Jesus and that's
[46:54] the only thing I want to see is Jesus
[46:55] Christ seeing then that we have a great
[46:58] high priest that has passed into the
[47:01] heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold
[47:04] fast to our
[47:11] profession so the author of
[47:14] this he may not have been there but he
[47:17] knew the disciples like Peter and James
[47:21] and John he knew those brothers and they
[47:23] gave him witness they said hey
[47:27] that we were
[47:30] there Jesus raised from the dead and he
[47:33] was with us and then he went up into
[47:37] heaven and we watched him going up when
[47:39] we were sitting there like wow and then
[47:43] these two angels said hey what are you
[47:45] looking up in the sky
[47:47] for and he said angel said listen that
[47:52] he is going to come down in the like
[47:54] manner that he went up telling he's
[47:57] going to come back this man Jesus Christ
[48:01] he went up and he's God he's up he
[48:03] ascended up to the right hand of God but
[48:05] he is also coming back and he's going to
[48:09] come back in the same way that he left
[48:11] and we're looking for that
[48:13] today for we have not a high priest
[48:15] which cannot be touched with the feeling
[48:16] of our infirmities but was in all points
[48:19] tempted like as we
[48:21] are so he knew he' been
[48:25] there he knew how was to be tempted he
[48:28] knew he knew what that was but yet
[48:31] without sin that's just
[48:35] amazing let us therefore come boldly
[48:37] under the throne of grace that we may
[48:39] obtain mercy and find Grace to help in
[48:42] time of
[48:45] need it's a throne of grace and it's not
[48:48] a throne of
[48:50] Justice if it was that Throne of Justice
[48:52] we would all be lost but Jesus Christ
[48:55] stood for us
[48:59] Hebrews chapter
[49:04] 5 for every high priest taken from among
[49:07] men is ordained for men in things
[49:09] pertaining to God that he may offer both
[49:12] gifts and sacrifices for sins so this is
[49:15] the high priest who is ordained to go
[49:17] into the holy of holies like we talked
[49:19] about this morning and present the
[49:21] sacrifice and the offering and stand in
[49:24] Pre in the presence of God the Father
[49:27] that is what it is for every high priest
[49:29] is taken from among men so so one of
[49:32] these men one of these Levites is
[49:34] ordained as the high priest for these
[49:37] things pertaining to God and this high
[49:39] priest this
[49:41] man who can have compassion on the
[49:44] ignorant and on them that are out of the
[49:47] way for that he himself also is
[49:50] compassed with
[49:52] infirmity so this high priest this man
[49:56] we're not talking about Jesus here we're
[49:57] talking about the
[49:59] man he is able to have compassion on the
[50:02] ignorant because he
[50:04] himself also has
[50:07] faults a sister came to me the other
[50:10] day and she told me that she doubted her
[50:17] salvation because of the sins that were
[50:20] in her past and it was just the hardest
[50:23] thing for her to get over and she was
[50:25] she was telling me about all these
[50:27] things that she had done and and that
[50:29] God hasn't forgiven her for these sins
[50:31] and she is just filled with guilt for
[50:34] these past mistakes that's a very common
[50:36] thing by the
[50:37] way and especially and many times is
[50:40] with the sisters they really have a
[50:43] tough time getting over mistakes that
[50:46] they have made the some of the brothers
[50:48] do too but it's it's hard for certain
[50:52] personalities and certain people to get
[50:54] over that and she feels feels like she's
[50:58] not
[50:59] forgiven
[51:01] and my answer to her was that sister it
[51:06] doesn't matter if you feel forgiven or
[51:09] not your your feelings really don't
[51:11] matter in this it's have you repented of
[51:15] your sins have you asked God for
[51:17] forgiveness of those sins and no matter
[51:20] what the sin is then you have a promise
[51:24] that they are forgiven and you can
[51:27] always there's always something that you
[51:29] can there's always a some sort of a
[51:31] loophole that you can say well I'm not
[51:33] saved you can always do it because
[51:35] that's that's in your mind but the fact
[51:38] is the formula is that if you repent of
[51:41] these sins you're baptized in the name
[51:44] of Jesus Christ you bring these sins
[51:47] before the Lord you lay them out the
[51:48] altar say Lord I'm not able to do
[51:50] anything about this and then he forgives
[51:53] you that's called Christianity
[51:57] and it's so hard for for many times it's
[52:00] so hard for us to just lay those sins
[52:02] aside we sinned In the Flesh so many
[52:06] times we have to suffer in the flesh but
[52:08] remember that's just the flesh this
[52:09] flesh is carnal it's going to be gone
[52:13] one day it's it's going to cease to
[52:15] exist so you may have sinned like like
[52:18] Don he sinned and he heard his
[52:21] body and he suffered towards the end of
[52:24] his life for that but but that was his
[52:27] flesh he was as pure as pure can be
[52:32] inside in his
[52:34] soul and the
[52:36] spirit that that feeling that we have of
[52:40] that guilt and and and that that just
[52:43] hits people so hard that Spirit of
[52:45] condemnation does not come from
[52:48] God if you have made things right then
[52:51] that cannot be from God Satan right now
[52:55] is at the Throne of God condemning each
[52:59] of us for our sins but Jesus Christ
[53:01] stands between Satan and the father and
[53:05] he is the pritu for that sin he is
[53:08] paying for that sin let's read it let's
[53:11] uh let's turn to Revelation chapter
[53:16] 12 yeah Revelation chapter I think
[53:22] chapter yeah Revelation 12 verse 10 it
[53:26] says this and I heard a loud
[53:30] voice in heaven now is come salvation
[53:34] and strength and and the kingdom of our
[53:38] God and the power of His Christ for the
[53:41] accuser of our Brethren is cast down
[53:45] which accuse them before our God day and
[53:50] night so he's there if you feel that SP
[53:54] if you feel that Spirit of condemnation
[53:56] coming what you're doing is you're just
[53:58] feeling that Devil's con that he's he's
[54:02] he's accusing you and you're getting a
[54:05] little bit of that imagine if you were
[54:06] on trial and you hear the prosecuting
[54:10] attorney telling the judge everything
[54:13] that you've done wrong imagine how that
[54:16] would make you
[54:17] feel and here he is he's saying well in
[54:21] the
[54:22] secret life that no one else can see
[54:26] here's what he did here is what she did
[54:31] and you're just thinking oh this is so
[54:34] bad the judge is hearing this and you
[54:36] feel this this guilt and that's what
[54:39] we're feeling when we can't when we
[54:42] can't we don't have to forgive ourselves
[54:44] by the way that's a worldly statement oh
[54:45] you got to forgive yourself before you
[54:46] can forgive everything no no no that's
[54:48] that's not the forgiveness is not up to
[54:50] us as far as ourselves we forgive other
[54:53] people but ourselves we don't have that
[54:55] power it's up to him to forgive us but
[54:59] imagine how you feel when all of those
[55:02] accusations and the fact is that those
[55:05] accusations are true but someone else
[55:08] took the blame for you and we are immune
[55:13] from prosecution we have diplomatic
[55:16] immunity nobody can accuse us Satan
[55:20] cannot accuse us because my fair has
[55:23] been paid my sins have been covered they
[55:27] have been paid for so you have your
[55:30] salvation through the sacrifice of
[55:33] Christ but the devil is still accusing
[55:37] you David said in the Psalms he said
[55:41] restore the joy of my Salvation let's
[55:45] just read it Psalm
[55:49] 51 I love this man I love this Psalm 51
[55:59] uh 13 you know let's just read let's
[56:02] just read from verse one it says this
[56:04] Psalm
[56:05] 51 it says have mercy upon me oh God
[56:09] according to thy loving kindness
[56:10] according unto the multitude of thy
[56:12] Tender Mercies blot out my
[56:16] transgressions Wash Me thoroughly from
[56:18] mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin
[56:22] for I acknowledge my transgressions and
[56:24] my sin is ever before for
[56:28] me against thee thee only have I sinned
[56:32] and done this evil in thy sight that
[56:34] thou mightest be justified when thou
[56:37] speakest and be clear when thou judgest
[56:41] behold I was shapen in iniquity and in
[56:45] sin did my mother conceive
[56:47] me we're born
[56:52] Sinners behold thou desirest truth let
[56:56] me let me go back to that when I said we
[56:58] were born Sinners I mentioned this on
[57:00] Wednesday night I want to mention it
[57:01] again because I believe that it pleased
[57:02] the
[57:03] Lord we are born some of us may be born
[57:08] Liars some of us may be born thieves
[57:11] some of us may be born uh with a loose
[57:15] tongue others as I was witnessing to
[57:19] those boys on Wednesday
[57:21] night one of them may be born with a
[57:26] perverted Spirit homosexual
[57:29] Spirit maybe born with that I'm not
[57:33] saying I I know a lot of the a lot of
[57:35] the churches say oh well you're not born
[57:36] with that well you can be born with
[57:38] these other things why can't you be born
[57:41] with that the answer is you can but the
[57:44] answer also is that you can overcome
[57:46] those
[57:47] things no matter what the sin you will
[57:50] not be tempted in you so much that that
[57:53] you cannot
[57:55] overcome amen and
[57:58] David here is saying behold I was shapen
[58:01] in iniquity and in sin did my mother
[58:03] conceive me I was born in sin and I was
[58:05] shaped in iniquity behold thou desirest
[58:09] truth in the inward parts and in the
[58:11] hidden part Thou shalt make me to know
[58:13] wisdom Purge me with hup and I shall be
[58:16] clean you know what hup is hup is just a
[58:20] common weed a common plant in Israel
[58:24] that they used to apply the
[58:28] blood for the
[58:31] atonement it says
[58:34] here it says Purge me with hup and I
[58:39] shall be clean wash me and I shall be
[58:41] whiter than snow make me to hear joy and
[58:44] gladness that the bones which thou Hast
[58:47] broken May Rejoice hide thy face from my
[58:50] sins and blot out all my
[58:53] iniquities Lord don't look at my sins
[58:57] for they are many hide my
[59:00] iniquities create in me a clean
[59:03] heart oh God and renew a right Spirit
[59:07] within me you can see how we can sing
[59:10] these cast me not away from thy presence
[59:13] and take not thy Holy Spirit from me
[59:16] restore unto me the joy of thy salvation
[59:20] and uphold me with thy free spirit then
[59:27] then so Lord deliver me here is Satan
[59:30] he's accusing he's accusing he's
[59:32] accusing and and it's just coming down
[59:34] upon us Lord deliver me deliver me make
[59:37] a clean heart in me Lord help me restore
[59:40] that Joy of my salvation I Lord I want
[59:44] to know that I'm
[59:46] saved and re and Lord let me have that
[59:49] joy that I once had and here's David
[59:52] saying that and he said once Lord then
[59:55] once I received that strength and I
[59:58] understand that no I have been been
[59:59] forgiven now look at how the stakes are
[1:00:02] raised here and he says then will I
[1:00:05] teach transgressors th transgressors thy
[1:00:09] ways and sinners shall be converted unto
[1:00:14] thee oh how
[1:00:17] wonderful Lord if you'll just show me if
[1:00:19] you can just help me with with my
[1:00:21] transgressions and then help me to
[1:00:23] receive this Victory then I'm not just
[1:00:25] going to stand up and jump up and down
[1:00:27] well I might for a little while but then
[1:00:30] there's something for me to do now I'm
[1:00:32] going to help somebody else who's
[1:00:34] struggling with
[1:00:35] it because I've been through it I'm
[1:00:38] going to help somebody and that's that
[1:00:40] high priest he has been through it verse
[1:00:43] number three back to
[1:00:46] Hebrews and by reason hereof he
[1:00:52] ought speaking of the high priest and by
[1:00:55] reason here
[1:00:56] of he ought as for the people so also
[1:01:00] for himself to offer for sins what he's
[1:01:02] saying is this high priest he wasn't
[1:01:05] perfect so how could I if I am that high
[1:01:09] priest how could I go and make an
[1:01:12] atonement for you if I have sin in my
[1:01:15] life I can't so the first thing that
[1:01:19] this high priest has to do is he has to
[1:01:22] go and make a sacrifice for his own sins
[1:01:25] because because he's a sinner I don't
[1:01:28] care if he's a preacher I don't care if
[1:01:30] he's the high priest he's got sin in his
[1:01:33] life so he has to go and he has to make
[1:01:35] atonement for his own sin kill the lamb
[1:01:38] and then he can go and he can make an
[1:01:40] atonement for someone
[1:01:44] else and no man
[1:01:47] taketh this honor unto himself but he
[1:01:50] that is called of God as was Aaron so
[1:01:53] even this high priest like Aaron he was
[1:01:54] chosen by God
[1:01:56] to be in that position and he's not
[1:01:58] there by his own
[1:02:00] choosing it's an election for this
[1:02:03] Minister this priest to be in that
[1:02:08] position and with that Authority and
[1:02:10] with that relationship with God so also
[1:02:14] Christ glorified not himself to be made
[1:02:17] a high priest but he that said unto him
[1:02:20] Thou Art my son today I have begotten
[1:02:23] thee as he saith also in another the
[1:02:26] place thou art a priest after the order
[1:02:29] of
[1:02:30] MDC the author mentions this is the
[1:02:32] first time he mentions this mysterious
[1:02:34] man melchisedek and we're going to get
[1:02:37] to that in future
[1:02:40] chapters but he's planting the seed
[1:02:43] right here this is kind of for
[1:02:45] foreshadow
[1:02:47] foreshadowing who in the days of his
[1:02:50] flesh when he speaking now of Jesus who
[1:02:54] in the days of his flesh when he had
[1:02:56] offered up prayers and supplications
[1:02:58] with a strong crying and tears unto him
[1:03:01] that was able to save him from death and
[1:03:04] was heard in that he feared other
[1:03:06] translation says that he was heard
[1:03:09] because of his
[1:03:11] reverence Jesus Christ was heard in his
[1:03:16] prayers because of his reverence because
[1:03:19] of his
[1:03:20] sincerity uh we could stay for a long
[1:03:23] time on that how Jesus Jus himself the
[1:03:27] reason that God heard
[1:03:30] him the reason that God bent down his
[1:03:33] ear wasn't because he had the title of
[1:03:35] the
[1:03:36] Messiah it wasn't because of of any of
[1:03:39] these other things the reason that God
[1:03:41] heard him right here the author is
[1:03:44] saying is because of the reverence of
[1:03:46] Jesus
[1:03:48] Christ so how should we follow in his
[1:03:52] footsteps how much should we Revere
[1:03:56] God and approach him in a reverent
[1:04:01] way because even the son of God says
[1:04:05] that he was heard because he had that
[1:04:08] sincerity he had that
[1:04:11] respect though he were a
[1:04:13] son yet learned he obedience by the
[1:04:16] things which he suffered and being made
[1:04:19] perfect he became the author of Eternal
[1:04:21] salvation unto all them that obey him
[1:04:26] I don't need to expound on that let me
[1:04:28] read it again though he were a son yet
[1:04:31] he let yet learned he obedience by the
[1:04:34] things which he suffered and being made
[1:04:37] perfect speaking of Jesus and being made
[1:04:40] perfect he became the author of Eternal
[1:04:43] salvation unto all them that obey him
[1:04:48] wow that's beautiful that's our savior
[1:04:53] that's right called of God a high priest
[1:04:57] after the order of
[1:04:58] MDC of whom we have many things to say
[1:05:02] and hard to be uttered seeing seeing you
[1:05:05] are D all dull of
[1:05:07] hearing
[1:05:09] now the end of this chapter is going to
[1:05:13] end with a rebuke of all of
[1:05:17] us and I think we need
[1:05:22] it I think that part of the
[1:05:26] Gospel when Jesus preached much of his
[1:05:32] ministry was of was correction yes it
[1:05:34] was salvation but we forget that Jesus
[1:05:37] warned us that if you don't do things
[1:05:39] you're going to go to hell he warned us
[1:05:42] that if you don't live right then you're
[1:05:45] going to suffer and he said things like
[1:05:49] come on to
[1:05:50] me all ye that are burdened and heavy
[1:05:53] laden and I will give you rest
[1:05:56] he said those things but he also brought
[1:05:58] us correction and he he brought us
[1:06:02] um really not the law but he brought us
[1:06:07] a magnified law where
[1:06:10] before the Bible says Thou shalt not
[1:06:14] commit
[1:06:15] adultery so here Jesus is one of the ten
[1:06:17] commandments so Jesus comes and he says
[1:06:21] oh yeah don't commit
[1:06:24] adultery he said
[1:06:26] but if you look at a woman and you
[1:06:33] want to have a relation with her then
[1:06:36] you are guilty Jesus raised the bar it
[1:06:41] says that he said Thou shalt not
[1:06:44] murder and then Jesus comes back and he
[1:06:47] says if you just hate a Man Without a
[1:06:49] Cause And if you are just tearing his
[1:06:52] character down then you are guilty of
[1:06:56] murder so Jesus raised this law up and
[1:07:01] he brought correction and the author of
[1:07:03] this book of Hebrews here in every
[1:07:06] chapter you'll notice there is a bit of
[1:07:08] correction and he said that he says of
[1:07:11] whom many and speaking of Jesus in mzc
[1:07:15] he says of whom we have many things to
[1:07:17] say and hard to be uttered seeing it you
[1:07:19] are dull of hearing you're not
[1:07:24] listening for
[1:07:27] when for the for when for the time you
[1:07:30] ought to be teachers you have need that
[1:07:33] one teach you
[1:07:35] again which be the first principles of
[1:07:37] the Oracles of God and are become such
[1:07:41] as have need of milk and not of strong
[1:07:43] meat he's telling them that you should
[1:07:47] be a lot further along than you
[1:07:49] are now look at me when I read this and
[1:07:54] I hope that each one of us each one of
[1:07:56] us are looking at ourselves saying we
[1:07:58] should be a lot further along than we
[1:08:02] are for everyone that useth milk is
[1:08:04] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[1:08:07] for he is a babe but strong meat
[1:08:09] belongeth to them that are full of age
[1:08:11] even those who by reason of use have
[1:08:14] their senses exercised to discern both
[1:08:17] good and evil you're always in the word
[1:08:19] you're always praying you're always
[1:08:22] ready and and if you're always ready
[1:08:26] to do something for God to follow
[1:08:29] God's um Commandments let's go back
[1:08:33] brother Jordan if you start with verse
[1:08:35] 11 and I'm going to read the Amplified
[1:08:37] version as I said before the Amplified
[1:08:39] it adds some words in there that aren't
[1:08:42] in the original context but they're uh
[1:08:45] they're they help to understand it says
[1:08:49] this concerning this we have much to say
[1:08:51] and it is hard to explain since you have
[1:08:53] become dull and sluggish in your your
[1:08:55] spiritual hearing and disinclined to
[1:08:58] listen for though by this time you ought
[1:09:01] to be teachers because of the time that
[1:09:03] you have had to learn these truths you
[1:09:06] actually need someone to teach you again
[1:09:08] the elementary principles of God's word
[1:09:12] from the beginning and you have to come
[1:09:14] you have come to be continually in need
[1:09:17] of milk and not solid food for everyone
[1:09:20] who love lives on milk is doctrinally
[1:09:24] inexperienced and unskilled in the word
[1:09:27] of righteousness since he is a spiritual
[1:09:32] infant but solid food for the
[1:09:34] spiritually mature whose senses are
[1:09:37] trained by practice to distinguish
[1:09:39] between what is morally good and what is
[1:09:43] evil unless we have the close of Hebrews
[1:09:47] chapter
[1:09:49] 5 but here's the man here's the book of
[1:09:53] Hebrews saying
[1:09:56] you should be teaching these things
[1:09:59] seeing that you've come so
[1:10:01] far but you're claiming these things but
[1:10:04] you're still not there yet you're still
[1:10:06] living this this life and and you're not
[1:10:09] you're not excited about it it's it's
[1:10:11] not a center part of your
[1:10:13] life you should be eating meat you
[1:10:16] should be
[1:10:17] teaching and not just drinking milk and
[1:10:20] we'll
[1:10:22] close I uh I do at the musicians could
[1:10:25] come I do
[1:10:27] love I like our
[1:10:29] uh Sunday night Wednesday night meetings
[1:10:32] because I feel like I can just
[1:10:34] relax and and talk with people that that
[1:10:37] I know I love and I know that love me
[1:10:40] and brothers and sisters one thing I can
[1:10:42] say and as I was sitting in the back and
[1:10:45] just
[1:10:47] Lord what should I say should I say this
[1:10:50] should I not say that and one thing that
[1:10:54] came to my mind
[1:10:56] is that I want to say is after saying
[1:10:58] those things I know that I'm preaching
[1:11:01] to the
[1:11:03] choir I know that you all are strong in
[1:11:07] those things I know that you love the
[1:11:10] Lord Jesus I I know that and I know that
[1:11:14] you put him first but remember in all of
[1:11:17] these
[1:11:19] things don't just take part of it take
[1:11:23] take the whole thing
[1:11:26] believe in the Lord and and be strong in
[1:11:30] the Lord because he's good and he loves

[1:15:39] given to us and I appreciate the song
[1:15:42] special from the sister Irma and the
[1:15:45] brother Daniel coming here and putting
[1:15:47] in all the hard work that he has for us
[1:15:50] and it was just a beautiful day that we
[1:15:51] had
[1:15:53] today glad to see you all glad to be
[1:15:55] here you're glad to be part of this
[1:15:58] group bow our heads and close in
[1:16:01] [Music]
[1:16:04] prayer father as I'm sitting here this
[1:16:07] evening I'm thinking about this group of
[1:16:11] people that you've given given me you've
[1:16:14] given me to them I'm thinking about this
[1:16:16] day and this time that we're living
[1:16:20] in and I think about the great
[1:16:22] presidential debate that they had the
[1:16:23] other night
[1:16:25] so where these two men went in front of
[1:16:27] the entire world to give an account for
[1:16:30] their actions and for their
[1:16:32] views and in listening to
[1:16:35] that I
[1:16:37] thought what would I do if I was placed
[1:16:39] on the center stage in front of the
[1:16:41] whole world and I had to give an account
[1:16:43] for
[1:16:45] you and I had to give some words and I
[1:16:47] was given brief time a brief period of
[1:16:51] time to say something on your behalf and
[1:16:53] the great debate was
[1:16:55] on oh Father I think about this group
[1:16:58] that you've given me what would they say
[1:17:00] what would we say if we were given just
[1:17:03] a few minutes to speak on your
[1:17:06] behalf and I
[1:17:08] think would I show up to that great
[1:17:11] debate with a semi full of books of
[1:17:14] Revelations and famous writings of
[1:17:18] Doctrine would I show up with with all
[1:17:21] of that written material of all these
[1:17:24] doctrines and
[1:17:25] religions that were given down through
[1:17:28] the history father I think about
[1:17:30] that and I think when it's my turn and a
[1:17:34] question is presented to
[1:17:36] me would I pull out these pile of
[1:17:39] books and quickly go through them to
[1:17:41] give an
[1:17:42] answer or would I simply just hold up
[1:17:45] the blood soaked
[1:17:47] Banner
[1:17:49] soaked and dripping in blood father and
[1:17:52] on that Banner it says
[1:17:56] Jesus Christ of Nazareth he is my healer
[1:17:59] he is my savior and he is my king and
[1:18:02] that is the only answer that I could
[1:18:04] give here today to these questions that
[1:18:06] are presented let us be a group of
[1:18:08] people father that would just hold up
