[13:43] God don't we
[13:46] amen I saw the title of brother Daniel's
[13:49] sermon this morning when he sent the

[13:53] thinking about it as I was going to
[13:54] church and how great our God is amen
[14:00] I won't spoil it I'll let him share it
[14:03] but it was inspiring when I saw it and
[14:05] started thinking about
[14:07] it there's some prayer requests this
[14:11] morning sister milia writes in she says
[14:14] please keep Adam it's your son in your
[14:17] prayers he hasn't had much of any
[14:20] contact with the outside world in 10
[14:22] years and he was feeling a little down
[14:24] so let's just remember that
[14:27] request he's our friend amen

[14:35] father sister fols had a cataract
[14:39] surgery in her right eye and it resulted
[14:42] in an infection and currently can't see

[31:04] true God placed me here to answer those
[31:08] questions by the scriptures he's put me
[31:11] here so that you can ask me then I can
[31:15] give you a straight answer and I'll tell
[31:16] you it may not be the answer that you
[31:17] would
[31:18] expect but it'll be from my heart and
[31:22] I'll tell you now you have to understand
[31:24] this scripture for yourself but here is
[31:28] the foundation for it so please if
[31:31] there's a question ask me as I said I
[31:34] don't know how long God will have me
[31:37] here I don't know what he has in the
[31:40] future but I do know that there are two
[31:44] things that make the decision of me
[31:47] being here pastor and that is number one
[31:52] that it's God's
[31:54] Will and then number two that it's the
[31:57] will of of the majority of the
[31:59] congregation those two things must
[32:03] be and that's why I'm here and I believe
[32:07] that that God has placed me here and
[32:10] please if you have some question if you
[32:13] if you don't understand something use
[32:15] the gift that God gave and ask and I'll
[32:19] do my
[32:20] best it's
[32:25] um it's the most important thing
[32:29] to me as a pastor what I would like to
[32:31] see in the church is a group of people
[32:34] that are able to open up their
[32:37] Bible and understand what it says by the
[32:40] Holy Spirit by studying I've heard
[32:43] there's this one statement I've heard
[32:44] that I it always kind of got under my
[32:46] skin and I think it gets under my skin
[32:48] now more than ever is that saying that I
[32:51] wouldn't understand this Bible if it
[32:54] wasn't for my pastor my Prophet or
[32:57] whatever
[32:58] my answer to that is brother or sister
[33:01] that's telling me you didn't spend the
[33:03] time to really dig into it you didn't
[33:06] spend the time to pray about what you're
[33:09] reading you must understand this word
[33:13] God is a god of he has Sons and
[33:17] Daughters he doesn't have grandsons and
[33:19] granddaughters we are not as we just
[33:21] went through the whole book of Hebrews
[33:22] we are not
[33:25] under a priesthood or under a five-fold
[33:29] Ministry or under any of that it is a
[33:33] personal relationship between God and
[33:35] man the five-fold ministry is a gift to
[33:40] the people it is a gift for to Aid in
[33:45] the perfecting of the body of Christ it
[33:47] is here to help amen and that's that's
[33:51] why we're here but ultimately it is God
[33:55] and us I think I've been very very very
[33:58] plain i' like to read a
[34:03] scripture 1 Corinthians Chapter 14 verse
[34:06] 18 it says this this is the Apostle
[34:09] Paul's speaking and how important it was
[34:11] for Paul that the people could
[34:13] understand the scriptures he says this
[34:15] he says I thank my God that I speak with
[34:18] tongues more than you all yet in the
[34:20] church I had rather speak five words
[34:22] with my understanding that by my voice I
[34:25] might teach others also than 10,000
[34:28] words in an unknown
[34:30] tongue so what good does it speak what
[34:33] good does it do to speak in another
[34:34] language what good does it it might be
[34:37] impressive oh wow that was cool that was
[34:39] neat oh did you hear that it might be
[34:41] good but what good does it
[34:43] do it as Paul said it does good that you
[34:47] can understand what I'm saying and that
[34:50] you can apply it to your
[34:53] life you need to
[34:56] understand the absolute in all things
[35:00] which is the word of God remember the
[35:02] Bible says in the beginning was the word
[35:06] and the Word was with God and the Word
[35:09] was
[35:12] God Brethren be not children in
[35:17] understanding how be it in
[35:19] Malice be ye children but in
[35:23] understanding be men most other
[35:24] translations say be infants with regard
[35:28] to evil but in your thinking be
[35:32] mature in the law it is written with men
[35:36] of other tongues and other lips will I
[35:37] speak unto this people and yet for all
[35:42] that will they not hear me sayeth the
[35:46] Lord so I'll send you pastors I'll send
[35:49] you gifts I'll send you prophets I'll
[35:51] send people from foreign lands and I'll
[35:53] send you a Bible in your own language
[35:55] and yet still you won't listen listen to
[35:59] me it's important to the Apostle Paul
[36:02] that the people understand the Bible and
[36:06] it's very important it's a very
[36:08] important part of a church we have
[36:10] worship we have praise we have prayer we
[36:14] have all of these things and those are
[36:16] also part of it but the word should also
[36:20] be a central part of a church where the
[36:24] the message comes forth the people of
[36:27] absorb the
[36:29] message and then they leave closer to
[36:32] God through the
[36:33] word it's all part of it but that word
[36:36] let's not forget that word we must know
[36:41] it
[36:41] because as I said when that when that
[36:44] house starts to shake if you have a
[36:47] foundation that you can go back to and
[36:49] say no the Bible says this it may not
[36:52] Mak make sense in my mind but it still
[36:55] says it and I believe this Bible more
[36:57] than I believe my emotions or my
[37:00] thinking I want to point out I wasn't
[37:03] able the last chapter of Hebrews I
[37:07] wanted to point out one thing along
[37:10] those same
[37:11] lines that we have to
[37:14] understand this word Hebrews chapter
[37:17] 13 verse
[37:19] 5 it's something that we quote so much
[37:22] but I want to give you a context to it
[37:25] and and don't just pull out a scripture
[37:27] now you can some some scriptures are
[37:29] written that way like Proverbs and um
[37:31] and Psalms they're meant they're they're
[37:33] written in a poetic style they're meant
[37:35] to be able to take to take them out of
[37:37] context but here most aren't let your
[37:42] conversation be without covet Covetous
[37:45] covet
[37:46] covetousness can't even say it that's
[37:48] good um and be content with such things
[37:51] as ye have for he hath said I will never
[37:55] leave thee nor forsake thee so he's
[37:57] saying keep your life free from the love
[37:59] of money and be content with what you
[38:01] have for as he said I will never leave
[38:04] you Jesus speaking I'll never leave you
[38:06] nor forsake you so don't worry you have
[38:09] the promises of Jesus Christ in your
[38:11] life so don't worry about these things
[38:14] it doesn't
[38:16] matter what people do to you brothers
[38:18] and sisters you don't have control over
[38:21] that but it's how you
[38:23] react to what they do that is what you
[38:27] have control
[38:28] over and with that story I just told
[38:31] about this
[38:33] brother we can't control how people do
[38:36] us wrong we can't control what people
[38:38] say about us but what we do have full
[38:40] control over is our
[38:43] reaction and how and that's what proves
[38:46] what we are is how we
[38:48] react so that we may boldly say the Lord
[38:51] is my helper and I will not fear what
[38:54] man shall do unto me remember them which
[38:56] have rule over
[38:58] you the ESV says remember your
[39:02] leaders who have spoken unto you the
[39:04] word of God whose Faith follow consider
[39:07] the end of their conversations so so the
[39:10] English an version says remember your
[39:11] leaders who spoke to you the word of God
[39:14] consider the outcome of their way of
[39:16] life and imitate their faith so he's
[39:20] saying these people that minister to you
[39:22] that are are telling you the word he
[39:24] said remember them think about them and
[39:27] think about what they say and then
[39:29] imitate their way of
[39:32] life Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[39:36] today and
[39:39] forever verse number
[39:43] eight look at the
[39:45] context be not carried away with diverse
[39:47] and strange doctrines for it is a good
[39:49] thing that the heart be established with
[39:51] Grace not with Meats which have profited
[39:54] them that have been occupied therein we
[39:56] have an altar
[39:58] whereof they have no right to eat which
[40:00] serve the Tabernacle his topic is still
[40:03] on the ministry it's still on the
[40:05] priesthood so when we we quote this
[40:08] scripture this Hebrews chapter 13:8
[40:11] Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[40:13] today and forever don't forget it is in
[40:17] a context here and he is the same but
[40:21] don't just pull it
[40:22] out remember that it has a
[40:26] meaning the this Hebrews 138 and yes he
[40:29] is the same yesterday he does the same
[40:32] things as he did way back when he does
[40:35] the same things now and he will always
[40:37] do the same things his nature doesn't
[40:39] change but be careful about taking the
[40:41] scriptures out of context so it's so
[40:45] often that I see the people that quote
[40:48] that some of the people that quote that
[40:50] scripture the most are the ones that
[40:53] pull out the ministry from the church
[40:56] wow and say no you don't need to have a
[40:58] pastor you don't need to have a church
[40:59] you just stay
[41:02] home Hebrews
[41:05] 13:8 brothers and sisters put that
[41:08] that's that that scripture into
[41:13] context don't just quote it understand
[41:17] what it
[41:20] means the Bible has always
[41:25] been the enemy
[41:27] me it's always been his one of his
[41:31] tactics to pull the word of God away
[41:35] from the people to try to get it to
[41:38] where number one they can't read it they
[41:41] can't understand it and and then to like
[41:45] today that they don't want to hear it
[41:48] they don't want to read it it's it's I
[41:52] was um we were having our devotions uh
[41:54] with the family we're on vacation my
[41:57] daughter asked she said um
[42:01] why do things always get so hard why
[42:05] does God always bring such
[42:08] hardships and I said I said honey I said
[42:10] you know I've been telling this to the
[42:11] church for the past few months that
[42:14] these hardships are a blessing because
[42:17] in the good times it's often that we
[42:20] won't serve God we're not thinking about
[42:22] God in the good times but it's in the
[42:24] hard times that's when we get to our
[42:27] needes because we need something and I
[42:29] said it's just Mercy from God that he
[42:32] puts us through these trials and these
[42:34] tribulations it's that's that's God's
[42:36] mercy on us he loves us so he he allows
[42:40] us to go through these things and and
[42:43] then we we as we progressed on there I
[42:46] said it's always the the devil's way to
[42:49] pull the word away from the people and I
[42:52] I quoted um that saying that that's so
[42:57] often they say that that I wouldn't know
[42:59] what this Bible meant if it wasn't for
[43:02] and the Catholic say if it wasn't for
[43:04] the priests so there was a long time
[43:06] stretch there that they had the Bible
[43:08] written in
[43:09] Latin that the common people couldn't
[43:12] even understand it so they needed that
[43:15] priest up there to explain what it is
[43:18] and then you have these men like John
[43:19] Wickliffe come along and they say no the
[43:22] people need to know this so they take
[43:25] the Bible and they translate it into the
[43:27] the common language and then you have a
[43:29] man like named Martin Luther that
[43:31] started a whole
[43:33] Reformation he wanted the people to have
[43:37] the Bible in their own language so he
[43:39] took it and he translated it into German
[43:42] then his contemporary a friend of his uh
[43:44] William Tindale he did the same into
[43:47] English and it's always Satan's way to
[43:52] tell the people you can't understand
[43:54] this Bible on your own
[43:57] and it is always God's way and a servant
[44:01] of God to say you
[44:04] can you can understand it you can
[44:08] believe it and these promises that are
[44:10] in this Bible and here is the ministry
[44:12] coming out they are just as true today
[44:15] as they always have been Jesus Christ is
[44:18] the same yesterday and today and
[44:21] forever and if you have a need God can
[44:25] meet that need right
[44:28] so let's turn in our
[44:31] Bibles to
[44:33] Malachi the 3 chapter and I want to get
[44:36] into this the son of
[44:41] righteousness Malachi 3 verse 13 to lay
[44:44] a foundation so so we're putting all of
[44:47] this into context and the Book of
[44:50] Malachi and and brother ly I can't wait
[44:52] till we get there I'm the pastor so I'm
[44:55] going to take this one
[44:59] it's one of that's it's one of the best
[45:02] it's just it's such a great book because
[45:05] it shows the the human nature and the
[45:08] Book of Malachi is this hypothetical
[45:10] dialogue between God and between people
[45:14] and he says that you have done this
[45:16] certain thing and they're like wait a
[45:18] minute when have we done this and then
[45:19] he will explain why that they have done
[45:22] these sins Malachi 3:13 it says this
[45:26] your words have been Stout against me
[45:29] they've been harsh or arrogant against
[45:31] me sayeth the Lord yet you say what have
[45:35] we spoken so much against
[45:37] thee you have said it is vain to serve
[45:40] God and what prophit is it that we have
[45:43] kept his ordinance and that we have
[45:45] walked mourn mournfully before the Lord
[45:48] of hosts he says what gain so so the
[45:51] people are complaining they and they say
[45:52] in their hearts maybe what gain is it
[45:56] that we go and we're mournful mournful
[45:59] and and and we're not
[46:01] happy and we're serving God and and
[46:04] things are just so
[46:07] bad and he
[46:09] says and now we call the proud
[46:14] happy the ESV and NIV both said we call
[46:18] the Arrogant
[46:21] blessed yay they that work wickedness
[46:24] are set up basically the evildoers
[46:27] Prosper yay they that tempt God are even
[46:30] delivered they're saying that the
[46:32] Sinners they're they're they have a
[46:34] better life than us they're being
[46:36] blessed more than we are what do we have
[46:39] to go about saying in in mournful ways
[46:42] and saying oh I'm such a sinner and all
[46:44] and all this they that feared the
[46:47] Lord spake often one to another and the
[46:51] Lord hearkened and heard
[46:53] it so he's saying here so here is God
[46:56] responding he's like you say that
[46:59] serving God has hindered you and you're
[47:02] saying that these people that don't
[47:04] serve God everything's good for them and
[47:06] they're blessed but listen to this then
[47:09] they that feared the Lord spake often
[47:11] one to another and the Lord hearkened to
[47:15] the people that Hur that feared him to
[47:17] people that respected him and the Lord
[47:20] hearkened and heard it he listened to it
[47:22] and he heard it and the and a book of
[47:25] remembrance was written
[47:27] before them that feared the
[47:31] Lord and that thought upon his name how
[47:35] beautiful so so this book of remembrance
[47:38] so there's somebody or something
[47:40] recording our thoughts and recording
[47:43] what we are doing and writing it
[47:47] down and saying here's Bethany she cares
[47:51] she cares what I said she thinks about
[47:54] my word I'm going to write her name down
[47:58] here and here is this other person he
[48:00] doesn't care he may go to church but
[48:02] he's there serving
[48:04] himself recording all of these things
[48:08] and saying and writing these names in a
[48:13] book and they shall be mine those ones
[48:17] that are in that
[48:18] book they shall be mine sayeth the Lord
[48:22] of hosts in that day when I make up my
[48:25] jewels calling us Jewels calling us
[48:31] his
[48:35] treasure in the day when I make up my
[48:37] jewels and I will spare them as a man
[48:40] spareth his own son that serveth him
[48:43] then they then shall ye return and
[48:46] discern between the righteous and the
[48:49] wicked between him that serveth God and
[48:51] him that serveth him not so here is this
[48:54] book and it's written these are the ones
[48:57] that are
[48:58] sincere and here he comes he comes back
[49:02] and he discerns who wants to serve him
[49:05] and who doesn't want to serve
[49:08] him for behold chapter
[49:12] 4 behold the day cometh that shall burn
[49:16] up burn as an oven and all the
[49:20] proud yeah and all that do wickedly
[49:22] shall be
[49:24] stubble and the day that cometh shall
[49:26] burn them up sayeth the Lord of hosts
[49:29] that it shall leave them neither root
[49:31] nor Branch you know what that means when
[49:33] you burn if you've ever come out after a
[49:36] forest fire you see a tree that's been
[49:39] burned and then there's there's these
[49:42] trees you'll go out and after the rain
[49:45] hits there's still a stump there and
[49:48] you'll see especially the
[49:50] Oaks and the junipers you'll see that
[49:53] they'll start growing from that stump
[49:55] right but then there are other trees
[49:58] that it burns all the way down into the
[50:00] ground and all the way through the roots
[50:02] so you you look at the ground and
[50:04] there's Ash all around there's a hole
[50:05] there and you can see where the roots
[50:07] once were it burned all the way down in
[50:09] there and there is nothing left of that
[50:11] tree it is completely gone and that's
[50:15] saying here it won't leave them any any
[50:17] root any branch there is nothing left of
[50:19] those per
[50:21] people
[50:23] but unto you that fear my name
[50:27] shall the son of righteousness arise
[50:30] with healing in his
[50:31] wings and shall go forth and grow up as
[50:34] CS of the stall I love this is where
[50:37] brother William this is where English we
[50:39] get a special
[50:41] blessing we have different translations
[50:43] of the Bible into different languages
[50:45] but in English it says the son of
[50:49] righteousness we all think son Like Son
[50:52] of God it doesn't say that it says son
[50:55] like in the SK
[50:57] guy and this son arises with healing in
[51:02] his wings and in English it's such a
[51:04] blessing because s o n and Su n are
[51:07] pronounced the
[51:09] same and really they are the same in
[51:12] this
[51:13] scripture the son of righteousness shall
[51:15] arise with healing in his wings and ye
[51:17] shall go forth and grow up as calves of
[51:19] the stall and ye shall tread down the
[51:22] wicked and they shall be asers under the
[51:24] souls of your feet in the day that I
[51:28] shall do this sayeth the Lord of
[51:31] hosts Jeremiah 23:5 I'll read this
[51:34] quickly it says this behold the day
[51:37] cometh sayeth the Lord that I will raise
[51:39] unto David A righteous
[51:42] branch and a king shall reign and
[51:45] prosper and shall execute judgment and
[51:47] Justice in the earth speaking of Jesus
[51:49] Christ in his day Judah shall be saved
[51:52] and Israel shall dwell safely and this
[51:55] is his name whereby he shall be called
[51:57] our Lord our
[52:00] righteousness the same this son of
[52:03] righteousness shall arise with healing
[52:05] in his wings Daniel and I were um we
[52:07] would wake up
[52:08] early uh when we were on vacation and we
[52:10] would go and we would watch the
[52:13] sunrise so we were out the previous
[52:16] evening and we were fishing and we were
[52:18] coming back and it was it was getting
[52:19] late and the sun was going down and
[52:22] there was this Lookout and there was all
[52:24] these people at this Lookout and they're
[52:26] waiting to see the sunset and man
[52:29] they're they're all out there and
[52:30] they're they're posing and and they're
[52:33] doing you know the the thing and and
[52:36] getting all their pictures and and just
[52:38] just doing everything and it's going to
[52:40] go up into the um where it goes and
[52:46] uh and all these people there's probably
[52:49] there was over a h 100 there at this
[52:51] beautiful
[52:53] Lookout and you know we look back in the
[52:56] Sun is going down it's pretty and it's
[52:58] nice and we're going and we go home so
[53:01] the next morning Daniel and I get up
[53:03] around I don't know 5:00 and and we get
[53:05] ready and we go we go for a walk and we
[53:08] go to that same place and there was no
[53:11] one
[53:12] there it's starting to get light there
[53:16] was no one in that area where just a
[53:19] little while ago just 8 hours ago or
[53:22] whatever it was 12 hours ago there was a
[53:24] hundred or more people there and now
[53:26] there's no one
[53:28] there and the sun is coming up it's not
[53:32] quite up
[53:33] yet and I said buddy I said you see that
[53:37] I said remember last night there was all
[53:39] these people here and now there's no one
[53:42] here and I told them I said anyone can
[53:45] watch a
[53:47] sunset but it takes an effort to watch a
[53:51] sunrise you got to get up early you have
[53:54] to do something to watch that son rise
[53:57] up that son of righteousness come up and
[54:02] it said for those that love me for those
[54:05] that keep my Commandments for those that
[54:08] fear my name shall the son of
[54:10] righteousness arise with healing in his
[54:14] wings and
[54:16] that's what the end time believer that's
[54:20] what the True Believer wants to see is
[54:23] that sun rising as I said anyone can
[54:28] look at a Sunset and see the the the
[54:32] seriousness of what's going on in Israel
[54:34] they can see all of the immorality
[54:36] that's going on in the world they can
[54:38] see all of these things and I mean
[54:40] anybody can do it take a picture here we
[54:44] are we're at the end but it takes an
[54:48] effort to watch that Sunrise you got to
[54:52] get up
[54:54] early but unto you the fear my name
[54:56] shall the son of righteousness arise
[54:58] with healing in his wings and you shall
[55:00] go forth and grow up as calves of the
[55:03] stall what is that
[55:06] mean have you ever how many uh how many
[55:10] have ever had livestock have ever had
[55:12] horses have you ever taken a horse or a
[55:16] calf or whatever out of its Paddock out
[55:19] of its stall into a big area into a
[55:22] pasture or a Corral or whatever it is
[55:25] and let him go
[55:27] they don't just wander off it's like oh
[55:30] great I'm out of my
[55:32] stall no way man they take off and you
[55:36] better stand back because they're
[55:38] kicking and they're jumping and they're
[55:39] bucking and they're really happy because
[55:42] now they're liberated now they're free
[55:44] and you're stuck in this stall and then
[55:47] when you really accept this son of
[55:49] righteousness when you really believe
[55:51] all of a sudden all these weights on
[55:53] your shoulder brother Dan it's gone
[55:56] and you jump and you shout and you
[55:58] praise and you say thank God I'm out of
[56:01] that stall I'm free and you look those
[56:05] horses going out they kick and they they
[56:07] they buck and they're just so happy that
[56:10] they're not stuck in the pen anymore and
[56:13] that is when that son of righteousness
[56:15] Ares with healings in his wings and what
[56:17] a Christian really sees how beautiful
[56:19] then you say praise
[56:21] God John I believe in the Book of
[56:24] Revelation John saw remember the book
[56:26] John saw his name on the book maybe
[56:29] looked
[56:31] over the Angel's
[56:33] shoulder
[56:35] John that's me and he said I shouted so
[56:39] loud all of Heaven could hear
[56:41] me and that's how we are when you really
[56:45] are free and you say no it's not about a
[56:49] a a formal religion now it is about
[56:52] Christ in me the son of righteousness
[56:54] how has arose in my life life and now
[56:58] he's here and I'm
[57:01] free imagine how Peter felt Peter was an
[57:05] ordinary everyday
[57:07] guy fished him and his
[57:11] brother um
[57:14] Andrew and then he saw
[57:18] something in this man Jesus
[57:22] Christ he saw that these scriptures came
[57:26] came to
[57:27] life in him he saw that this son of
[57:31] righteousness wow my sins are
[57:34] forgiven all of this that I've been
[57:36] reading about in my Bible it all comes
[57:38] true in this man Jesus Christ you can
[57:41] imagine how how good he
[57:44] felt and then when he received the Holy
[57:46] Spirit that promise came down upon
[57:50] him and they spoke in tongues that all
[57:53] of these things were manifested
[57:56] and then this other man Paul came in a
[57:58] much different way you have Peter over
[58:00] here is just an ordinary everyday
[58:02] guy and then you have Paul over here
[58:05] who's a preacher in a
[58:08] church
[58:09] self-righteous
[58:11] legalistic judging
[58:13] everyone but still as much of a sinner
[58:17] or more than Peter was when Peter was
[58:18] out on the boat cussing and arguing and
[58:21] gambling and do whatever he was
[58:23] doing but still as much of a sinner as
[58:26] Peter was and look what happens he gets
[58:28] knocked
[58:30] down and he
[58:33] finds this man Jesus Christ is actually
[58:36] the real thing he comes out of that old
[58:39] bondage that he was in if you read the
[58:42] book of Galatians it's like you're not
[58:43] under this bondage anymore come out of
[58:46] that you are
[58:48] free and what's so great you can do
[58:50] whatever you want
[58:53] now and you do do whatever you want you
[58:56] do whatever you want no matter
[58:58] what but when you receive that Holy
[59:01] Spirit and when you come out of that
[59:02] stall then you can do whatever you want
[59:05] and now you want to serve God you want
[59:08] to please God and that's what makes you
[59:10] so happy that's what that's what is such
[59:12] a liberating thing is now I'm not trying
[59:15] to please man I'm not trying to please
[59:17] my parents I'm not trying to please my
[59:19] pastor I'm not trying to to please my
[59:21] teacher or my coach or whatever now I am
[59:24] pleasing God
[59:26] and I'm not under
[59:28] that and these people they came out they
[59:30] came out of those stalls think of Mary
[59:34] Magdalene mentally mental problems
[59:38] struggling as worldly as you can
[59:41] be and then when that
[59:43] man came into her life you can imagine
[59:47] the joy that was with
[59:50] Mary it didn't matter people judging her
[59:54] it didn't matter what she used used to
[59:56] struggle with she was free she came out
[1:00:01] of that stall I think of I think of Paul
[1:00:05] so much that he was in that bondage of
[1:00:07] that religion that he was in he was
[1:00:10] Paul's anger was in his
[1:00:13] heart but when that son of righteousness
[1:00:16] arose with healing in his
[1:00:19] wings look at what he
[1:00:24] said I can quote it
[1:00:27] but I'll read
[1:00:31] it he said this but covet earnestly the
[1:00:35] best gifts and yet I show unto you a
[1:00:38] more excellent way though I speak with
[1:00:41] tongue of men and angels and have not
[1:00:43] love and become a sounding brass and a
[1:00:46] tinkling symbol and they'll have the
[1:00:47] gift of Prophecy and understand all the
[1:00:49] Mysteries and all the knowledge and all
[1:00:51] and have all all that I have all faith
[1:00:53] that I could remove mountains and have
[1:00:55] not love I am
[1:00:57] nothing the same man that wanted to kill
[1:01:01] those people that wanted to destroy the
[1:01:04] very son of
[1:01:07] righteousness Legion Mark chapter
[1:01:12] 5 what had what had happened was
[1:01:16] Jesus had just went the the disciples
[1:01:19] had just gone out on the boat without
[1:01:21] him it was late the evening was dark
[1:01:27] so the storm comes
[1:01:30] up Jesus comes calms the
[1:01:35] storm and
[1:01:37] then they go to
[1:01:40] land now we don't know
[1:01:45] exactly what time of the day that they
[1:01:48] came to land but the Lake's not very
[1:01:52] big and they could have have come to
[1:01:56] land at night but this man Legion looked
[1:02:00] out a far off and he saw Jesus so there
[1:02:03] had to be light there so I'm looking at
[1:02:06] this and seeing this was in the
[1:02:10] morning here's
[1:02:12] Legion out of his mind possessed with
[1:02:15] all of these demons probably worse than
[1:02:17] we see out here on the street and here
[1:02:19] is this man and and he looks out and the
[1:02:22] demons well up inside him and they see
[1:02:24] this man and they see that he is the Son
[1:02:27] of
[1:02:29] God Legion when that son came up that
[1:02:33] day the son of righteousness was coming
[1:02:35] to
[1:02:38] Legion he looks
[1:02:40] out he sees Jesus walking towards
[1:02:45] him he had such problems we kids
[1:02:50] today there may be some people here that
[1:02:53] that have done it before but they'll cut
[1:02:55] themselves
[1:02:57] brothers and sisters that's a sign of an
[1:03:00] evil spirit it's a sign of insanity
[1:03:02] Legion cut
[1:03:05] himself with with these sharp
[1:03:07] rocks he was he was struggling with this
[1:03:12] verse number seven Mark chapter
[1:03:15] 5 and he cried with a loud voice and
[1:03:18] said what have I to do with thee Jesus
[1:03:19] thou son of the most high God I adure
[1:03:22] Thee by God that thou torment me not for
[1:03:24] he said for he said unto him come out of
[1:03:27] the man thou unclean spirit and he asked
[1:03:29] him what is thy name and he answered and
[1:03:31] said my name is Legion for we are
[1:03:34] many man was possessed with all of these
[1:03:37] demons and he besought him much that he
[1:03:41] would not send them away out of the
[1:03:42] country now there was nigh unto them
[1:03:46] unto the mountains a great herd of of
[1:03:48] swine feeding and all the Devils beh
[1:03:50] besought him saying send us into the
[1:03:52] swine that we may enter into them and
[1:03:54] for withth Jesus gave them leave and the
[1:03:57] unclean spirits went out and entered
[1:03:59] into the swine and the herd ran
[1:04:01] violently down a steep Place into the
[1:04:04] sea there were about
[1:04:07] 2,000 and were choked in the sea do you
[1:04:10] see the goal of Satan do you see the
[1:04:13] goal of mental illness the ultimate goal
[1:04:15] is to take your
[1:04:16] life the ultimate goal is for you to
[1:04:19] take your own
[1:04:20] life and here it is here we see this
[1:04:23] evil these evil demons they go into
[1:04:26] these simple-minded pigs and immediately
[1:04:28] they commit
[1:04:30] suicide that's what he wanted of Legion
[1:04:32] but the son of righteousness arose that
[1:04:35] morning for
[1:04:40] Legion
[1:04:43] then Legions healed and he says he says
[1:04:46] I want to go with you and Jesus makes a
[1:04:50] statement he says no you stay here and
[1:04:52] you tell others about what's happened to
[1:04:56] you so here's here's
[1:05:00] Legion and and he goes and Jesus tells
[1:05:03] tell him go tell your friends and all
[1:05:04] this witness to other people and that's
[1:05:07] what a Christian does when that son of
[1:05:08] righteousness arises with healing in his
[1:05:10] wings on me or on you what's the first
[1:05:13] thing that you should want to do is go
[1:05:15] to others and say Hey you can have this
[1:05:19] I'm free now I'm not stuck in the stall
[1:05:21] anymore I'm liberated now you have it
[1:05:25] right not cut people out not destroy
[1:05:29] people not put them down not condemn
[1:05:31] them but say this is what's happened to
[1:05:33] me you can have it just like I have it
[1:05:36] and that's what Legion did Jesus said go
[1:05:39] tell your
[1:05:41] friends
[1:05:43] then I don't have time but in uh in Mark
[1:05:48] chapter 7 the sarap phenician woman the
[1:05:51] serop phenician woman she's a a Syrian
[1:05:56] woman from Phoenicia Siro Phoenician
[1:06:00] woman she came to to to
[1:06:04] um Jesus she's a gentile and her
[1:06:07] daughter was suffering with probably the
[1:06:09] same thing that Legion was suffering she
[1:06:11] humbled him herself Jesus was a bit rude
[1:06:14] to her at first but she continued to
[1:06:17] Humble herself he said he basically
[1:06:20] called her he says no he says you can't
[1:06:22] he says she says Lord help me help my
[1:06:25] daughter and he says your
[1:06:29] dog he says he says I'm not going to
[1:06:31] give
[1:06:32] you give the dog the
[1:06:35] food from the master's table and then
[1:06:37] she says but
[1:06:39] Lord the dogs eat the crumbs from the
[1:06:42] master's table she humbled herself right
[1:06:44] there how many of us would have done
[1:06:45] that and then Jesus said your daughter
[1:06:48] is healed and she was delivered on that
[1:06:50] day then the same chapter he talks about
[1:06:54] a deaf man how to speech him impediment
[1:06:56] that all these healings were going on
[1:06:58] and they brought this deaf man and they
[1:07:00] said just lay your hands on him just lay
[1:07:03] your hand on
[1:07:04] him it's not always laying on of hands
[1:07:07] so Jesus did a very strange
[1:07:09] thing he
[1:07:13] spit and he takes it and he puts it on
[1:07:16] the Man's
[1:07:18] Tongue deaf man he he was deaf he
[1:07:20] couldn't see I mean he couldn't hear and
[1:07:22] he couldn't speak then immediately man
[1:07:25] was given his hearing and he was able to
[1:07:29] speak I I've told the story before in
[1:07:31] our testimonies I'll tell it again you
[1:07:34] know who FF Bosworth is brother Bosworth
[1:07:38] was at a prayer meeting with brother
[1:07:41] brandom and there was a man brother
[1:07:43] Bosworth couldn't hear very well and
[1:07:45] there was a man that was deaf that came
[1:07:48] forward brother Bosworth turns him
[1:07:51] around to the congregation
[1:07:56] sets him in front of the congregation
[1:07:57] prays for him and says okay
[1:08:02] brother can you
[1:08:04] hear and he said
[1:08:06] yes and he says brother you're going to
[1:08:10] have to you're going to have to have
[1:08:11] more faith he prays for him again and he
[1:08:15] says brother can you hear and he says
[1:08:19] yes he says brother listen you got to
[1:08:22] have more faith
[1:08:25] he prays for him again he says' brother
[1:08:28] can you hear the man turns around and he
[1:08:30] says' brother I can hear maybe we need
[1:08:31] to pray for you
[1:08:35] now it's good but what what means the
[1:08:39] most brother Manny what means the most
[1:08:41] from that story is that the man was
[1:08:46] healed and it was an expected thing and
[1:08:50] we have gone so far away from that now
[1:08:53] where we don't really expect our healing
[1:08:55] wow anymore and we should that same
[1:09:00] God that healed that man with brother
[1:09:03] Bosworth is the same God that's here
[1:09:06] with us today he's the same I have a
[1:09:10] friend I haven't talked with him in many
[1:09:12] years but I have a friend in
[1:09:15] Africa that he um he went to evangelist
[1:09:21] he went to this place um in Mala called
[1:09:24] monkey Bay
[1:09:26] it's a dangerous area because there's a
[1:09:28] lot of Muslims there and he's obviously
[1:09:31] a
[1:09:32] Christian and he goes and and he he is
[1:09:36] ministering and and the people start
[1:09:38] giving their hearts to the Lord and He
[1:09:40] baptized eight people that
[1:09:43] day and and he got in through a bishop
[1:09:46] of that area a Christian Bishop was able
[1:09:48] to get him into this Village so the
[1:09:50] village headman comes to my friend John
[1:09:53] and he says my
[1:09:57] daughter has never been able to hear or
[1:10:00] speak since she was
[1:10:01] born and I forgot how I think she was
[1:10:03] about 10 years old let me see if I um I
[1:10:06] think she was about 10 years
[1:10:08] old and
[1:10:11] John lays his hand on the little on the
[1:10:15] girl and prays for her and he says okay
[1:10:19] can you hear now and she says you know I
[1:10:23] can hear she didn't say that but she
[1:10:25] raised her hand she could obviously
[1:10:27] hear and the the the whole the whole
[1:10:31] village was watching all of this going
[1:10:33] on and he says but she still can't speak
[1:10:37] he lays his hand on her
[1:10:39] again and prays again and then the girl
[1:10:43] starts
[1:10:44] speaking Miracle right there in front of
[1:10:47] him and then this this this message
[1:10:50] starts spreading
[1:10:52] around this area
[1:10:55] that God is alive that he does the same
[1:10:57] things now as he did then as he did when
[1:10:59] you read the Bible other people are
[1:11:01] getting healed he goes to another place
[1:11:03] and he said he said the greatest miracle
[1:11:06] I have ever
[1:11:07] seen and he says brother he says I've
[1:11:11] never seen something like this he says
[1:11:14] we were praying for these people in this
[1:11:15] other Village and he said they wielded
[1:11:18] up this little skinny man in a
[1:11:23] wheelbarrow dying of age
[1:11:29] and he looks down at the
[1:11:30] man and he lays his hands upon the man
[1:11:36] and the man jumps up and was completely
[1:11:40] healed of that dreaded disease that has
[1:11:43] no that has no cure went back to the
[1:11:45] doctors and showed John his his
[1:11:49] testimony HIV negative a man that was
[1:11:53] just about to die imagine that man that
[1:11:57] morning in all the pain that he was
[1:11:58] going through and that son of
[1:12:00] righteousness arose with healing in his
[1:12:02] wings because this man talked about a
[1:12:04] living Jesus
[1:12:06] Christ he's
[1:12:08] alive the son of
[1:12:11] righteousness is there for those
[1:12:15] people that fear his
[1:12:18] name that love him and let me tell you
[1:12:21] John this man he does not believe like I
[1:12:24] believe he doesn't believe like you
[1:12:25] believe either but he does believe in
[1:12:28] Jesus Christ he believes in a God that
[1:12:31] heals for that we do believe and we
[1:12:35] stand upon that and as I've said many
[1:12:38] times there will be Jesus himself said
[1:12:40] there will be one Shepherd and one fold
[1:12:44] and that Shepherd is Jesus Christ and
[1:12:46] that fold are his children and just
[1:12:48] because I don't see things the way John
[1:12:50] does doesn't mean that God can't use him
[1:12:53] or use me
[1:12:56] these powerful testimonies we've seen
[1:12:59] them and this son of righteousness
[1:13:02] brothers and sisters it
[1:13:04] arises in our lives with healing in his
[1:13:09] wings and he takes the old that's right
[1:13:13] and he makes it
[1:13:15] new the musicians can
[1:13:19] come here in This Book of
[1:13:23] Malachi let me read it again
[1:13:26] again for behold the day
[1:13:29] cometh remember the back and forth the
[1:13:32] ones that don't respect him the ones
[1:13:34] that don't believe him for behold the
[1:13:36] day cometh thou shal burn as an oven and
[1:13:38] the and all the proud Y and all that do
[1:13:39] wickedness shall be stubble and the day
[1:13:41] cometh shall burn them up sayeth the
[1:13:43] Lord of hosts it shall lead them leave
[1:13:45] them neither root nor Branch they will
[1:13:47] be destroyed for ever gone eternally
[1:13:50] separated from God but unto you
[1:13:55] this is this is a good part but unto you
[1:13:58] that fear my name to you that respect me
[1:14:02] to you that try to you that try to do
[1:14:06] what I teach in this word to you that
[1:14:09] take the time to come to church to you
[1:14:12] that take the time to read your Bible to
[1:14:15] you that take the time to pray to you
[1:14:18] that really respect me to you that that
[1:14:21] believe me that fear my name
[1:14:25] shall the son of righteousness arise
[1:14:27] with healing in his wings and you shall
[1:14:29] go forth and grow up as calves of the
[1:14:33] stall you're out of that
[1:14:35] bondage that bondage of the world that
[1:14:38] bondage of sin where you're constantly
[1:14:40] condemned for everything that you're
[1:14:42] doing where it's it's just this weight
[1:14:44] that you
[1:14:46] carry when that son of righteousness
