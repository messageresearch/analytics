would pour out your spirit upon us that that out of Heavens Lord would come instruction and the word of God that that we might be better people and that we might make our way through this world Lord make it to the end of the road where we can go up live an eternity with our father bless the service we pray Lord in Jesus name amen God bless you all you can take your seats we um a blessing this morning we have a a well-known family that that keeps getting bigger and bigger and they don't they're doing it quickly it's hasn't been in the traditional sense brother Jeremy and sister Angela Servants of the Lord real pillars in this church and they're taking on these foster kids and they're building a foundation in these kids they have a it was um jobed Moos Moses's mom she only had a little while to spend with her children or spend with Moses and she planted a seed in him and that man had one of the greatest characters that's ever walked the Earth and one of the reasons because he had a good Mama and a good daddy so we want to dedicate the kids to the Lord and um brother Jeremy I'm going to get number two and I have name I haven't even had time to memorize the names yet I'm gonna oh she's asleep she don't want me to wake her up can I wake her up I'm just kidding they're not they're not they're not experienced yet don't wake my kid up um sister Angela I'm going to have you read their names you don't have to read their names you probably know their names by now okay so zakah zakah arah zenity Amara chance amen so do you do you kids do you know what we're doing today you know why we come to church we come to church to get closer to Jesus and you know how Mom and Dad are always teaching you about the Lord Jesus and talking about him well what we do is we bring the kids up to the pulpit and what we're doing is we are we are doing something that was done in the Bible they brought Jesus all the little kids and they brought they brought them to Jesus and then Jesus gave them to the Lord so that's what we're doing today so so can I give you guys can I give you to the Lord Jesus do you want to be the Lord Jesus's little kids you you know what we sang that song that that I am a child of God you know I'm a Child of God when I was a little kid I was probably about your age my parents brought me to this very pull pit right here and the pastor back then his name was brother Perry green he dedicated me to the Lord Jesus so I want to do that same thing to you all can we do that okay so let's come together and as a church if we could bow our heads Heavenly Father what a great honor it is to dedicate a child to the Lord Jesus and father it's it's even a greater blessing to dedicate children now father we pray that the Holy Spirit would guide these children father and may the prayer that's going up right now always guide them through their lives may they know Jesus Christ and in the power of his resurrection and Lord as they grow and they start making decisions on their own May the Holy Spirit be there for each one of these children to guide them and may father they all grow if you would Terry to be Servants of God and be safely in the bosom of Jesus Christ pray for brother Jeremy and sister Angela this great you're taking Lord that you would give them wisdom love and the power of the Holy Spirit we pray now Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we dedicate these children to you amen amen did you hear good job that was good she said amen sweetheart again we're building a foundation not just in these kids but also in us and every time we get on our knees every time we open our Bible every time we listen to a sermon we're doing our best to shore up that Foundation that we have in our lives I want to thank everybody for the for your patience for all the construction that we have going on it's it's going to continue um it's uh we've been tearing stuff out I appreciate brother Ed and all the work that he's he's seems like he's here all the time and all the work that he's doing we um we've got the walls ripped out we've got um the um the studs put in and we're doing our best to get everything settled and and I want it to be just really nice for us tell you the truth I don't think that we can make it nice enough for this group of people but we're going to do our best to really to make it make it good and one of those things that that I've heard a couple times is talking about these pillars that we have in the fellowship hall and I hear it so much can we get rid of these pillars and further ahead and you know there's something about a pillar in a church and these pillars they're there because they're holding up something and not only are they holding up something but the pillars underneath these pillars when you pour a foundation for a house you pour the slab deeper you make a deeper foot footing and you put Steel in there and and it's It Go goes down deep and you compact it and you put gravel in there and you really take care of where this pillar is going to go because there's going to be a lot of weight that's on the pillar and if you put that pillar over on the regular slab it'll crack and it'll compromise the whole structure and when working with these pillars they carry a lot of weight and we can't just take them out there's there's walls and stuff that that if they're not a loadbearing wall we can take those those walls out they're not that important they're just kind of separating things but there's some walls that are loadbearing and underneath those walls there has to also be a footer so those walls can carry this weight and it's the same with the pillars in the church the people we brothers and sisters you have these pillars they carry a weight and everybody seems to want to be a pillar but I ask you are you carrying any weight are you just there just for looks there's this pan there's by the way there's 12 pillars in in the fellowship hall and I thought wow that is so fitting 12 pillars 12 tribes 12 Apostles and we have 12 pillars holding up the ceiling over there and but there's there's one pillar over there that if you go in the back and by the drinking fountain it's this big wide pillar and it doesn't hold up anything it's just taken up space and on the other side you look and there's an electrical panel there and I told Brother Ed I said get rid of that pillar because it's not doing anything we can move that that electrical box we can put it on the wall or something and I think it's like it's it's so common even in the church where you have someone they want to be a pillar but they're just taking up space and like I'm the I'm the I'm holding the electrical box anybody can hold that thing so I've asked brother Ed get rid of that thing and uh brother Ed I'd hate to remove your pillar from the the place so make sure you get rid of it I don't like that thing um but this these these pillars like I said they're built on a foundation they're holding up they're holding up the church and so often you see that there's people that come in and they're unstable they're not holding up anything and that man who's unstable he can't stick with something he's he's they're they're cha always chasing someone something else and they never truly find what they're looking for and brothers and sisters we all know that those ones that are unstable they don't have the respect in the church because we all see it we all see it's it's hopping here and hopping there and they're it almost seems like they're looking for the next their next former Church they took you a minute to get that you know what I mean it's here and then they're not stable so then they go to the next place and not stable and the fact is when they're there there's no Foundation there and they're not holding up any weight this church needs to be all of us in this room we need to be pillars brother Jonathan holding up the gospel and holding up the people let me tell you this church is going to continue to grow and as the church grows there's going to be more weight that is placed on the existing structure so that existing structure is going to need more pillars to to hold up the new weight that's in the church and if we don't get that it'll sag it it'll go down the problem with some of these these pillars is most people value really they value their own opinions higher than what the Bible says they get something in their mind and then they're looking for something to to criticize and as soon as they find it off they go to the next place and then they start looking again and as I as I said they're not they're not holding up anything except maybe the the gifts that are in the church they might be holding that up but if they would get right then they would be able to contribute and and to work with all of us and and I'm not talking about the the Tucson Tabernacle I'm talking about this is everywhere in General that's how how things are and and but these pillars that are in the church they're standing on this Solid Ground and they're standing on this fortified concrete below them that concrete's not going to crack that Foundation is solid it's not it's you don't never have to worry about it but if you take a 2x4 and you set it out out in the fellowship hall right there and you leave it you get it to balance there for a little while it's not holding up anything it's not attached to anything and you get a little bit of a breeze you get a little bit of a somebody bumps it and it just Falls right over and that's that fair weather Christian wow there's not there's not that foundational truth that's that's in them and as as I was studying on this you look at the Old Testament and you read you read about the people in the Old Testament and they're an there all through the whole thing all through the 4,000 years they're an unstable people have you ever noticed that there's no converts in the Old Testament very strange huh I mean you might have like Ruth and and uh Rahab a couple of them but there's there's no there's no converts there because there's no stability in the the Old Testament the people are inherently unstable then God would send a prophet or he sent a good King and he'd Shore things up and then as soon as that man died they immediately fall away again there's a phrase that's called from Pillar To Post if you're you're pulled from Pillar To Post and I looked that up and I thought this is really applicable it says that it means that someone is forced to keep moving from one place to another without achieving anything and it's often used to describe a situation where someone is constantly being moved around without any clear direction or purpose it's a sad state to be in I preached um a few weeks ago on walking in darkness and that's what that is there's no light there so you're walk in darkness and you're just bumping into things there you don't have a direction in your life when that direction in our lives should be to fortify and and to to build a pillar and then to hold something up I was been out in my boat before when I had a boat we um be out drifting around and it had an anchor and we we'd throw the anchor out and if that anchor an if it would catch into sand and if there was wind that anchor would just drag along and it would it would slow you down but it would just kind of drag along and and and you'd move and then if it would catch on a rock then then you you had a stable boat and that's how it is with our anchor brothers and sisters when we throw that anchor out it's got to catch into a foundation or we'll drift drift with wind anybody any anchor can hold a boat that there's no wind but when that wind picks up when that when that oak tree when it starts moving back and forth it needs to make sure that that Foundation is true the Apostle Peter said in 1 Peter 510 and I read this last week but the God of all Grace who ha called us unto his eternal Glory by Christ Jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen and settle you to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen so we appreciate these hard times as I said in talking about the crucifixion and talking about all the trials and tribulations that we go we go through because it's not the good times that God speaks to us because our ears really aren't tuned into God during the easy times it's when we suffer and when the when the hard times comes that's when we cry out to God and he's always there he's always there to answer us the problem is we don't cry out to him in the easy times so he allows the hard times to come and that's when that Foundation really digs in that's when those roots that we have they really go down strong in what we believe then when the doubts come then we have that strong Foundation brother and sisters we hear so much about our kids about a generation that's leaving the faith that we believe it's it's common it's not just common in our circles it's common all throughout the world and what happens is they have this knowledge that comes in and they can find they can poke holes in things the the kids don't do it but it's the enemy he comes in and he pokes holes in the way that we believe and and then if our foundation isn't strong if we haven't built that Foundation strong in our children then they just leave and then they're just pulled with every wind of Doctrine but a foundation has to be bu built and there's no Foundation that is strong except for Jesus Christ when we build a foundation on something else that foundation cracks that Foundation fails a pillar cannot be built on a weak Foundation my uh my grandpa wheeler told me one time he he said he he saw brother brandom tell this man this man came to brother brandom and he said brother brandom how do I get closer to God how do I really and these are my words how do I really firm up that Foundation brother brandom pointed over at a man named FF Bosworth he said and he told this I think I believe it was a minister that was seeking that that closer walk with the Lord he said go and sit under that oak tree for a while meaning FF Bosworth FF Bosworth was a famous evangelist in the early 1900s he was here um he was there at zza Street Revival strong man wrote the book Christ the Healer a book that has has been a blessing to so many people and caused so many people to receive their healing brother brandom tells him go sit under him for a while God's desire brothers and sisters is for his Temple to be built with Christ the Chief Cornerstone and the doctrines of the Apostles as the foundation when brother brandham had the vision of going beyond the curtain of time he um he asked the man he said would Paul be gathered with his people and and the man said the man said yes he said Paul would be gathered with his people and brother brandom said I preached the same thing that Paul preached and remember the people said we are resting on that what is that message that Paul preached what is it it's Jesus Christ and that foundation and any other foundation will fail I've heard so much people will ask you or us how we believe and we'll immediately start talking about the message brothers and sisters you got to have Roots what are the roots that were in the message when brother brandham preached it it was Jesus Christ brother brandom's Foundation was in Christ it wasn't in himself and we see our children do our children see that do they see that that strength that we have that I am Anchored In Jesus Christ do we know do they see our experience do they see what the message what going to church what believing has done in our lives and then we can say what here's what it'll do in your life remember when Samson when he wanted to tear down all the Philistines he was his eyes were gouged out his hair was cut he was at the lowest point of his life and he tells this kid he knows that they have this big Stadium full of all these Philistines as enemies and the enemy of God's people and he says bring me to the pillars that hold up the structure because he knew that if he could get to the pillars that he would destroy destroy the whole thing and bring everybody down with it so Samson wins he gets in there and he grabs these pillars tears them down and down comes the whole thing and Satan knows the same lessons if he can get to the pillars that are in the church then he can do a lot of damage I was just talking with brother Josiah in the back and I was telling him do you understand the responsibility that we have in going before the people do you understand in ministering and singing songs of worship do you understand that it makes us pillars in the church that people are relying on and then if our pillars aren't strong if our foundations aren't strong it doesn't just hurt us it'll hurt the whole congregation it'll hurt your families if your foundation is not strong do you know it's not just you it's your whole family that will suffer if your foundation cracks or if or or if your pillar isn't strong enough it'll bring down the whole structure on top of you all of us need to be holding up something if we're not holding up something then we're not doing anything you got to take root Revelation chapter 21 I'll read verse 14 it says this talking about the Heavenly City this great place with streets of gold and and and a place that we all long to be because Jesus Christ will be there there won't be a son the lamb will be the light it's going to be the most beautiful wonderful place in the world world and around this city is this giant wall and it's over 200 feet tall amazing you know how big Trump's wall is the border wall it's 30 feet this one's 200 feet tall and I don't know there's a lot of things that if this is an actual structure then it's going to have to have some am amazing foundations to hold this wall up the um the structure for Trump's wall the the the Footers are like 6 to 10 feet deep of of concrete fortified concrete this one 30 feet this one's 200 feet imagine the foundations verse 14 says this and the wall of the city had 12 foundations and in them with the names of the 12 Apostles of the Lamb this wall is higher than a 25 story building and the foundations in this wall are built on the doctrine and the built on the ministry of these Apostles so look at how important it is so so as we are deciding Lord do I want to serve you do I want to be a Christian the things that we look at are these these doctrines that have been set forth in the Bible so the foundational sermon of a Christian happened in Acts chapter 2 it's the first Christian sermon ever preached and it was preached by a man that had just received the baptism of the Holy Ghost tremendous tremendous Story So what had happened is is they had they were following Jesus's Commandments it was about 50 days after his crucifixion and then about 10 days after he had ascended up in heaven and they're there and they're waiting for this promise that God that Jesus had given them and then the Holy Spirit Falls and let's read it acts chap 2 vers1 says this and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance brother Wilson it's important this tongu is important it's a sign and there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under heaven and when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language so this is something really strange that had never happened before and when the Holy Spirit descended on the disciples in the upper room they began to speak in other languages and it was a sign that God was doing something supernaturally and importantly it had a purpose the ones that heard the disciples they heard them speaking in their own language and they thought it was really strange this was an outward display it was to show that the supernatural nature of God was being manifested in this book of in this gift of tongues Now 1 Corinthians tells us that now we we want be careful and how that we speak in tongues and and that we don't want to just be up there and speaking in in meaningless words because a visitor would come in and be like what's going on this is weird I've talked to people that have been in services like that they've gone and and they've the the people up there were were speaking in tongues they were like what in the world this is weird I'm not going to come back to this just manifested the same thing that that is saying here but with these tongues it had a purpose to show the power of God there and they were all amazed and marveled saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galileans how we hear how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born parthians and mes and Elites and the Dwellers in Mesopotamia and in Judea and in capid doia and in pontis and Asia and Fria and pamilia in Egypt and in in the parts of Libya about sirene and strangers of Rome Jews and prelit cits and Arabians we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God so the author here Luke is documenting all the different languages he wants to make sure we know this is a lot of different languages and they were all amazed and we're in doubt saying one to another what mean is this the super what happened is the supernatural got their attention now here is the sermon the foundational truth of Christianity the first sermon but Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of Judea and all that dwell in Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words this Peter is the man who was with Jesus when Jesus asked this question Jesus said who does everyone say that I am they said they said some say that they are Elias some say that they're John the Baptist but then Simon Peter answered in Matthew chapter 16 ver1 16 Jesus said to him he said who do you say that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou son Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it so that was back here a year or so earlier Peter showed that he had the revelation of who Jesus was and Jesus was going to build the church on his Revelation but the church wasn't built at that time yet God was deepening that foundation in the apostles he was putting steel in there he was he was putting the concrete in there he was pouring the footer he was thickening that concrete because there was something that was to come and Peter and his disciples didn't have it yet they weren't holding anything up yet and Jesus says to Peter and I will give thee give unto thee key the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven so once this Foundation is built then I will make you a pillar in the church then you will do Mighty Works in my name then whatever you bind on Earth I will bind in heaven but not now you're not ready yet he was just building this Foundation verse 15 in Acts chapter 2 and Peter is addressing the people again he says for these are not drunken as you suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel now the Apostle he's a pillar now he's filled with the Holy Spirit and he's talking about this Foundation that was laid and I want you to notice something that Peter did Peter said this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel how did Peter know that Joel said that he was reading his Bible he was studying the word and now he's going to quote Joel remember this had just happened he had just came out and he says listen this is what the prophet was talking about this is prophecy fulfilled and it and now Peter quotes Joel he says and it shall come to pass in the last days saith God I will pour out of my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and on my handmaids I will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and I will show wonders in heaven and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and Vapor of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and notable day of the Lord come so Peter here he's still qu he's still quoting the prophet Joel and darkness had just spread across the earth when Jesus was on the cross might have been a solar eclipse like coming in the United States soon I don't know if there was a lunar eclipse back then or if that time is to come or if it happened then and it's going to happen now but Peter's reading from the prophet and he knew through the holy spirit that this is that which what which was spoken of by the prophet Joel if you always in the word brothers and sisters and you're always praying and you're always calling on the name of the Lord then I believe that when prophecies come to pass we're always trying we're always trying to interpret proper prophecies we're always saying oh well brother brandham said this so so this is going to happen and we're always trying to figure out all of these things but let me tell you that when you will know when prophecy comes to pass when you know the interpretation of Prophecy is when it happens and if if you're in the word then you can say this is that which was spoken of by the prophet and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved that's what I want to concentrate that's what I want you to leave today remembering is that statement that Peter said right there there's no denomination here there's no sect there's no division of Christianity pet Peter is plainly saying that this was written by the prophet about the Lord Jesus and I ask the congregation really how many of us have truly called on the name of the Lord for our Salvation what an important thing that promise was given to us call on the name of the Lord I hear so much people say they'll witness and say well I have Jesus in my heart well that's good you know the Buddhist is gonna say well I have Buddha in my heart the muslim's going to say well I have aw in my heart and he tells me that Muhammad is his Prophet the Mormon's going to say well I have heavenly father in my heart and he tells I had a burning in my bosom that that Joseph Smith was his prophet in the Book of Mormon is true it doesn't hold a lot of weight but when you say that Jesus Christ died for my sins a Hindu can't say that Buddhist can't say that nobody can say that Jesus Christ died for their sins except for a Christian and I can and you and I can cry out to Jesus Christ and we will be saved there is the Foundation of Christianity and brothers and sisters when we believe the word on an intellectual basis when we can take the Bible and we can say well here's what I believe if you look to Malachi CH 4 and then you go over here to Revelation 10 and look at all of these things and doesn't this make sense that's an intellectual understanding and if it comes on an intellectual basis it can leave on an intellectual basis so that's not where it's at otherwise you know you're just convincing somebody to believe like you because it makes sense but when you really call out to the on the name of the Lord and he answers then it's something different then it's real when someone asks you what you believe you know when they ask you what the message is I hope you don't start rattling off a bunch of scriptures and give some apologetic type of answer they'll give you the same answer as a Mormon or whatever it is say this man showed me a living Jesus Christ this man showed me that Jesus Christ healed the sick this man showed me that Jesus Christ saves the lost this man showed me that Jesus is real that is something that will stick it doesn't lessen anybody's Ministry if you're talking about the Tucson Tabernacle I would hope that you would say that brother Daniel has showed me that Jesus Christ is my savior and now I believe in him like a blind man with Jesus you know he said the blind man got healed and then they they went to the blind man and they said hey come over here he said they said you know the man that did this he's a sinner blind man said he said well whether he's a sinner or not I don't know but what I do know is once I was blind and now I can see and that's the same that I feel with brother brandom and his message it's real that's the same thing that I feel it's like you know what I don't care what you say I really don't care what you say about him what I see is once I was blind and now I see once I didn't understand that God is alive today and that he heals the sick but my own grandparents people that I know were healed in his meetings so really I really don't care what you say he introduced us to a living Jesus Christ but it's about Jesus and that's the mistake that's what we need brothers and sisters we need to have that foundation in Christ I heard a story about this nurse that works with Daniel she went to school a little bit later in life um and she's recently graduated from nursing her first husband died when she was young second husband was a drug dealer he went to jail and she had a dad that really loved her dad was a truck driver he helped her take care of the take care of her kids and just just really looked after his daughter loving dad and she gets a call and her dad was at work and he has a heart attack the EMS come to the scene and he's collapsed and they're working on him on the ground they're doing CPR on him and they tried to resuscitate him for 31 minutes and if you're any type of a if you know any type of Health Care you know that 31 minutes without oxygen to your brain it's you're you're done so they they get him into the ambulance and they bring him take off to go to the hospital hospital this lady her name is Stephanie she gets in her car and she starts driving to go to the hospital and she tells Daniel she says I don't know if I was praying or what was going on or I was talking to God and she was thinking about all these bad things that are happening remember what I said last week that it's the darkest time that God speaks to you she finds herself on the side of the road an hour and a half later she doesn't know what happened she gets she comes to herself she drives to the hospital she gets there remember her dad is basically dead there's no way that someone that was gone for that long no matter how much you work on them there's no way that that they can be at least normal she was outside by herself self she leaned up against the wall and she started praying this is a lady that probably didn't know the Lord before she leans against the wall and and she starts praying and she looks down and she um I want to make sure I get the story right yeah she's leaning I don't know if she was praying she's leaning against the wall and she's thinking about everything that's going on imagine what she was what was going on in her mind that her dad who is taking care of her she didn't have a husband she she has these kids she doesn't know what to do she's leaning there and she's she looks down and there's another set of feet next to her and she feels a hand on her shoulder and she hears a voice and your dad the voice says your dad's going to be okay so you know what to think she she walks in the hospital she goes into the room and there's her dad sitting up in the bed with his suction tube swinging it around he's alive today still taking care of his daughter and these kids right there that woman met Jesus Christ that Foundation was built and you try to take that away from her wow no way she had an experience she had built that Foundation now she's a pillar and she is able to hold up other people wow Hallelujah she was in she was in a the um the room the other day with this man that was dying and she asks him what better thing could you ask someone ask when they are a pillar in God's Church they have had an experience that Foundation is firm she asks the man she says do you know this man was dying do you know Jesus Christ man said no so she goes back man dies so she tells Daniel now listen to how a Christian thinks she tells Dan Daniel she said but even though that he said that he still wasn't dead yet there was still time and she says I don't know maybe he did believe in Jesus before he died she said I believe he did that's the heart of a Christian there's always hope in a Christian but this woman this Stephanie she has a foundation she has those roots because she had that experience and that's with these disciples that's with a pillar a pillar in a church it can hold up weight because it has that Foundation it had an experience with God back to acts 22 acts 2:22 Peter continues on he says ye men of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you by Miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you as you yourself know they were there when Jesus did the Miracles they saw it they knew that there was something real and here is Peter and he's saying listen he was real I'm a testimony that he's real him being delivered by the determinant counsel and forn knowledge of God you have taken and by Wicked hand you have crucified and slain whom God has raised up having Loos the Pains of death because it was not possible that he should be Holden of it you've sinned in your life you've lied you've sto but this Jesus Christ can make it right for time sake let's skip to to verse 32 this Jesus hath God raised up whereof we are all Witnesses therefore being by the right hand of God exalted and having received of the Father by the promise of the holy ghost He hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear there were Witnesses living testimonies of Jesus Christ for David is not ascended into Heavens but he saith himself the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou on my right hand until I make thy FS thy foot stol therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made the same Jesus whom you have crucified whom you sinned against who you've disrespected who you really didn't care about both Lord and Christ imagine how these people felt at that time there was something in their hearts that believed what Peter was saying in this church about this man Christ because his foundation was real and they probably wanted that same Foundation now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart they were cut in their heart and and they said unto P people unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do brothers and sisters there's no repentance today very very little in the world today I think just the way we grow up in this generation you see very few people that are really sorry that really feel bad what they do I hear so much well I'm the bride I believe the message we're special we're the elite because we have a prophet if you had a prophet then you should know better then you should respect Jesus you should listen to what this man said so I look and I say where is this repentance today where are the pillars of the church where are those who will repent we live in this age this last age we call it the Leo Leo toan age let's read what it says about leoa Revelation 3:14 and unto the angel of the Church of the Leo Deans write these things sayith the amen the faithful and the true witness the beginning of the creation of God this is Jesus Christ himself talking I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that thou W cold or hot and you really don't believe you just got a rule book you just Define yourself wow with certain doctrines and certain things you pick and choose what you believe by your life style and then that's what you believe wow then so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth you make me sick is what God's saying you make me want to vomit because thou sayest I am rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and knowest thou not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked but you say I'm rich and increased with goods and I have need of nothing who do you hear say that maybe us we don't need anything more we got a prophet we're bride we're good everything's good we're just waiting for this world to burn so we can walk out on the ashes of the wicked that attitude defines the Leo Dean age it defines the Leo Dean Spirit where is the crying out to God for Mercy where is the crying out and calling upon the name of the Lord where is that you know we've got you know I heard a brother preaching the other day against pool halls and honky pool halls and honky ton I'm 52 I don't even know what a Hony talkon is he's living back in 1950 and and this brother was young he's just listening to what he hears he's just listening to things he's not able to apply it to this day we live in another day we live in a day when this has taking our time we live in a day as I said when it's all distractions to do everything that you can to keep your mind that Satan does to keep your mind off of of Christ and it's a lazy generation when people stopped working they're not willing to get out and look for a job and then stick to a job remember the pillar in there it's just back and forth and here and there they move from job to job they move from church to church they're not willing to D to put down roots and to do something and to hold somebody up that's right Bible says if a man doesn't work he shouldn't eat and then we hear we people think they they are entitled this is the generation that we live in this wasn't the generation sister Shirley 60 70 years ago that was not the problem back then but we have to be able to move forward and to take what we have heard to take the prophet's words and apply them to today brother brandom let me quote brother brandom blind leod Deans and again I said we're the elect but the Bible says that no that's not the case the Bible says that it's blindness and nakedness and they don't know it Verse 18 I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white with right white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes have that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen thank God for those low times I'm sure that that that nurse Stephanie will look back and say thank God that I had to go through that because my life is different now now I have a foundation now she said I am a Christian you couldn't call me a better thing as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will Su with him and he with me brother Braham said that's the saddest scripture in the entire Bible right there there is Jesus knocking at the door for his people and we've got too much we've got our religion we've got everything that we need we don't need anymore I got it I'm good everything's good and he's no you're not no you're not to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with my father and his throne he that hath an ear let him let him hear what the spirit saith and the churches the Leo toan age right here among us and we'll finish up back to Acts 2 let's read 237 again Peter's preaching his message and when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and they said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do remember this is a foundation of Christianity this is a first sermon that was preached and it's just as true today as it was then the devil tries to change it tries to tries to make it about some Doctrine or some some different sect of of of a religion but it's always the same and thank God that he recorded his this sermon in his book because we can go back to it and say here's what we do here is the prescription here's the directions when you say that I'm struggling when you say that I want to give my heart to the Lord Jesus it's the same every time we can go right back here to this first sermon to this foundation and when they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and the rest of the the apostles men and Brethren what shall we do and Peter said unto them repent something that's so rare as I said today is that true repentance that true sorrow that true commitment Lord I am going to to change I am going to go back I'm going to serve you and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins so you're repenting your heart is hurting because you've failed because you've sinned you've done something wrong so repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ Christ for the remission of that sin for the remission of those sins for the taking away of those sins and then you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Peter had just been filled and he said now you can have what I have now receive it it's that simple it's not jumping through all these hoops it's not going going through all this weird doctrines it is this very thing call out in the call on the name of the Lord for This Promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call look brother Josiah and and the musicians can come back to the pillars that are in the church this this man was a pillar Jesus said I will build my church on what on the revelation of who Jesus Christ is when he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God God Peter or Jesus said Peter Flesh and Blood hasn't revealed this to you my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you and Upon This Rock I will build my church and you will be a pillar we will be a pillar we will hold it up but we have to go back to Christ brother Dan you always preach about Jesus yeah let me tell you [Applause] something it won't stop it's not going to to deviate this way or to go that way the same Jesus Christ that saved Peter the same Jesus Christ that gave these instructions is the same Jesus Christ that saved me I will never stop claiming Jesus Christ every sermon that I preach is going to be about that man because you know what every sermon that's recorded in this new testament is about that man you get tired of it yeah you shouldn't I love when sister Lily play sings that song and the musicians they sing that song I speak Jesus I was thinking about that this morning I was I was up late last night and and I I was just thinking about it's all about Jesus God will send gifts into the church prophets with Incredible gifts to where you can come in and he will tell you here's what you've been doing here's your sin now go and sin no more that gift was not to lift us up that gift was not to lift him up that gift was to get you to Jesus Christ the book the whole thing is written to get us to Jesus it's written to lift up Christ and if we could just have that experience that Stephanie had that there's nothing that can take it away from me can you imagine if someone said well I don't think you understand that you have to um do this and do that to be a Christian she'd be like bro I saw him he put his hand on my shoulder he healed my dad don't tell me I don't know him and you won't ever see me brother Manny telling somebody they don't know him if you know him intellectually as I said then an intellect if you know him him by the by the by the word only then that intellectual Spirit can also come back and pull it away from you it's why we see people we see especially the younger generation we see them we see them leave they don't like it they're hurt it's because it was explained to them and they never went all the way those roots didn't go down and those roots need to be call on the name of God that's the root that's what I want to do is come back come back to the word come back to Christ don't neglect the gifts that God gave us they're gifts I'm not going to stick my hand in God's face and say I don't want your gift because it doesn't make sense to me no [Music] we welcome those gifts but every gift is to bring us to the Son of God to our Savior Peter said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins it is a commandment and brothers and sisters if you have not been baptized or if you were baptized and you didn't understand the baptism then I would suggest to you to be baptized now that you understand it to come to these Waters as was commanded by the Apostle right after he was filled with the Holy Spirit the very first Christian sermon building found building pillars in the church and it hasn't changed those pillars still have the foundation of baptism those still those pillars still have the foundation of the godhead those pillars still have the foundation of the Savior Jesus Christ but maybe sometimes they shake a little bit it's fortifying they nail a couple more 2x4s on there sometimes that's what I [Music] need I get it from prayer and I get it from reading the book I get it from being with God and serving God there is nothing more than to claim than to Proclaim Jesus Christ that song was just ringing in my ears shout Jesus from the mountains Jesus in the streets Jesus in the darkness over every enemy Jesus for my family let me tell you I don't care how low your children children are how how many problems that are there if Jesus can create the heavens and the Earth then he can save our children Jesus in the darkness over every enemy Jesus for our family I speak the Holy Name yes Jesus Christ is what the message is Jesus Christ is what the word is in fact it says that he was the word it's all about him I love talking about him I love praising him he's awesome man he's great I was reading this morning and Stephanie was walking by getting a cup of coffee or something I said honey he's awesome he's just great he's so good brother Wilson he's wonderful I want everyone to know him if you haven't been baptized or if you have a desire to be baptized it's a good time right now to make that commitment to do what the Apostle Peter said in the very first Christian sermon so if you have a desire to be baptized please go now to the back where the head will meet you I have a honor today of baptizing somebody that I feel is a pillar in this [Music] church tell you yes sir sister Elizabeth Jesus Christ is Real Jesus Christ is risen you say I have Jesus in in my heart you should have Jesus in your heart but point back to that empty tomb

day of Pentecost and he's given today brother angel I love him man he can change a life he can do anything and it's all done through love for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son
