[26:19] alone
[26:22] [Music]
[26:24] [Applause]
[26:31] amen you may be seated
[26:33] I was getting a little winded there at
[26:35] the end so
[26:37] every time we sing that song I think of
[26:39] sister Beauty
[26:40] she'd sit down right where brother Dan
[26:42] is there
[26:43] and they would brother Neil would say
[26:45] does anybody have a song and sister
[26:46] Billy would say no never alone
[26:49] I think she'd still have the same
[26:51] testimony she ever came by but half
[26:54] Shafter and introduce herself as a young
[26:56] lady to us and she would say I'm sister
[26:58] Beauty and no he never left me alone
[27:00] amen what a promise we have
[27:03] it'll testimony to share and I
[27:05] I don't know if everybody knew the
[27:08] details but when my sister-in-law
[27:10] Elizabeth was
[27:11] she got shingles and she was in quite a
[27:14] bit of pain and and suffering she went
[27:17] in for some um some testing exams and
[27:20] they told her that she's a good
[27:21] possibility she had MS
[27:24] so it's we've been praying believing and
[27:26] she was back with the doctor the other
[27:28] day and doctor said no you don't have MS
[27:30] you just have some lingering pain
[27:33] so thank the Lord for that
[27:36] you know and brother Brown says when you
[27:38] go to the doctor you go you listen to
[27:40] the doctor you do what they say why go
[27:43] otherwise you know and a good doctor has
[27:46] the best intentions and a good doctor
[27:49] knows that they can't heal you
[27:51] but you know you you you eat right you
[27:54] do the things that are right to do but
[27:57] there's one who said I'll never leave
[27:59] you alone
[28:00] I've got it everything I covered when he
[28:02] said it is finished he knew it was all
[28:04] covered so we appreciate them
[28:07] and sometimes we get a little bit a
[28:09] little bit nervous a little bit worried
[28:11] maybe we're like I've just recently
[28:13] changed a doctor and they're trying to
[28:15] get everything moved over and I get
[28:16] anxious and I get nervous and and then
[28:19] God reminds me he says I've got it all
[28:22] taken care of it's okay
[28:24] brother Jordan mentioned that brother
[28:26] Russell Wallace was driving and his car
[28:28] got hit by a lightning while he was
[28:30] driving
[28:31] the car was ruined but brother Wallace
[28:34] is still fine
[28:36] so sometimes we'll look at our
[28:38] possessions and say oh my look at this
[28:40] in him and I heard you met somebody by
[28:42] accident the other day sister Lily got
[28:45] rear-ended somebody wasn't paying
[28:47] attention
[28:48] but God watches over us
[28:50] you know and he is God
[28:54] you know and I you just have to say Lord
[28:56] I'm trusting in you and I'm believing in
[28:59] you
[28:59] sometimes we might look at our our life
[29:01] and the way things are going and
[29:02] wondering why Lord why
[29:04] [Music]
[29:05] but when you get to thinking about that
[29:07] just say you know maybe you're testing
[29:09] me like Joe because you said have you
[29:10] considered my servant job there's none
[29:14] like him and Satan says then give me a
[29:15] shot at him and God says go because I
[29:18] know they love me and they'll trust in
[29:21] me so thank the Lord for them
[29:25] Lord you are so precious to me
[29:28] I had to write it down so I could
[29:29] remember what song it is because I can
[29:32] never remember
[29:34] [Music]
[29:35] Lord you are
[29:39] so precious

[32:12] here
[32:13] as you get closer it kind of moves away
[32:16] and are we going to make it without
[32:18] getting wet
[32:19] kind of our concern you know and are the
[32:22] people going to be able to come but God

[35:34] things just to let us know and remind us

[39:21] more time before we open our Bibles Lord
[39:24] Jesus
[39:25] it is such an awesome privilege
[39:28] Lord in this 21st century
[39:30] Lord in a world that's in turmoil with
[39:33] threats of nuclear activity and things
[39:36] going on Lord that that we could not
[39:39] have foreseen or predicted even just a
[39:42] year ago but Lord we see these things
[39:45] going on around us Lord but our peace
[39:48] our safety is in you Lord we ask that
[39:52] you be with us this evening help me to
[39:54] be out of the way Lord to just be a
[39:56] channel for your words for your thoughts
[39:58] to reach out Lord to to touch hearts
[40:01] Lord to comfort Souls Lord to give peace
[40:04] and strength and encouragement Lord in
[40:06] these Troublesome times
[40:08] Lord we commit the remainder of this
[40:10] service to you we trust you we thank you
[40:13] in Jesus precious name amen
[40:18] you probably are all aware that today
[40:22] was Yom Kippur
[40:24] it's uh the day of atonement the most
[40:26] holy day on the Jewish calendar a day of
[40:29] introspection a day where where people
[40:32] think about where they are where they're
[40:35] going how they're living seeking the
[40:37] Lord's forgiveness and the repentance
[40:38] and then in the time of the Bible this
[40:41] was the day
[40:42] that the high priest
[40:44] made absolutely certain that everything
[40:46] was perfect before you went into the
[40:48] holy of holies because if he did one
[40:50] thing wrong
[40:52] he wouldn't come out they'd have to pull
[40:54] him out
[40:55] it was a very sober time a very serious
[40:57] time but the work the people's job was
[41:01] to repent and to approach the Lord
[41:04] but the burden fell on the high priest
[41:08] the burden fell on the high priest we
[41:11] have our high priest he doesn't make
[41:13] mistakes the burden has fallen on him he
[41:15] paid the price at Calvary we talked
[41:17] about that a few weeks ago about Jesus
[41:20] as a Passover Lamb but this is The Fall
[41:22] season now
[41:24] well last Wednesday when we met we
[41:26] discussed the Feast of trumpets tied in
[41:28] the two silver trumpets of Moses and
[41:30] some of the uses of trumpets in the
[41:32] Bible we noted that the Feast of
[41:34] trumpets was the only feast day that was
[41:36] uncertain because it fell on the first
[41:38] of the month the new moon when it was
[41:40] dark
[41:41] you knew approximately but you didn't
[41:44] know precisely when it was going to be
[41:46] until it was
[41:47] as Christians this suggests the Lord's
[41:50] return the resurrection of the Dead in
[41:53] Christ called to be his bride the
[41:55] catching away what we term the rapture
[41:58] of the elect prior to the period we
[42:01] speak of as the Great Tribulation
[42:03] the subject I have on my heart to share
[42:05] with you this evening is that of the
[42:07] rapture
[42:08] you might think of it as Feast of
[42:10] trumpets part two and and like Yom
[42:12] Kippur our job is to repent and be ready
[42:16] but our high priest does all the work
[42:20] please open your Bibles to First
[42:22] Corinthians
[42:23] chapter 15.
[42:25] and we'll start reading at the 50th
[42:27] verse
[42:29] appalled has spent this entire chapter
[42:32] addressing the certainty of the
[42:35] resurrection of Christ
[42:37] and the resultant inevitability
[42:39] of the Resurrection
[42:41] of the believer
[42:45] now this I say Brethren that flesh and
[42:48] blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God
[42:51] neither death corruption inherit
[42:53] incorruption
[42:54] behold
[42:56] I show you a mystery
[42:58] we shall not all sleep but we shall all
[43:01] be changed sounds like a promise to me
[43:04] in a moment
[43:06] and the twinkling of an eye at the last
[43:08] Trump for the trumpet shall sound
[43:11] the dead in Christ shall be raised
[43:14] incorruptible
[43:16] and we shall be changed
[43:19] for this corruptable must put on
[43:22] incorruption and this Mortal must put on
[43:25] immortality so when this corruptable
[43:28] shall have put on in corruption
[43:31] and this Mortal shall have put on
[43:35] immortality then shall be brought to
[43:38] pass the saying that is written death
[43:41] is swallowed up
[43:43] in Victory Paul's quoting Isaiah 25 8
[43:47] for you taking notes which means he will
[43:50] swallow up death and victory and the
[43:52] Lord God will wipe away tears from off
[43:54] all faces and the rebuke of his people
[43:57] shall he take away from off all the
[43:59] Earth for the Lord hath spoken it
[44:02] death is swallowed up in Victory oh
[44:05] death
[44:06] where's thy sting
[44:08] grave
[44:10] where's thy victory
[44:12] The Sting of death is sin the strength
[44:16] of the sin
[44:17] is the law
[44:19] but thanks be to God which givesth US
[44:22] gives us the victory through our Lord
[44:25] Jesus Christ are you sharing in that
[44:27] victory tonight
[44:29] it's yours to possess
[44:31] therefore Paul says in light of all this
[44:34] my beloved Brethren my beloved siblings
[44:37] this is not a male pronoun in the Greek
[44:40] be ye steadfast brother leonhardt used
[44:43] to say I'm not stubborn brother Lyle I'm
[44:45] steadfast
[44:47] be steadfast be unmovable
[44:50] always
[44:52] how frequently when we feel like it
[44:55] no we should constantly always be
[44:59] abounding
[45:00] plentiful not tiny or smaller miserly
[45:04] but abounding in the work of the Lord
[45:07] for as much as ye know that your labor
[45:10] is not in vain in the Lord in fact it
[45:14] has great value
[45:16] please be seated
[45:18] Paul is writing now to believers he's
[45:22] writing to members of the body of Christ
[45:26] Paul states that at some point in the
[45:28] future
[45:29] there will be a resurrection
[45:32] and the living at that time
[45:35] will be changed
[45:36] possessing the same Incorruptible bodies
[45:40] as the Resurrected
[45:43] this is the component
[45:45] of the event that we call
[45:47] the rapture
[45:50] in her news item I read this past week
[45:52] there was something called Rapture
[45:55] anxiety
[45:57] it's experienced by by some people who
[46:01] believe in the soon appearing of Christ
[46:04] Christian believers who accept the Bible
[46:06] as literal truth but some of them are in
[46:09] fear that they'll miss the rapture
[46:14] I saw this article and it brought back
[46:16] memories of my early teens ages 12
[46:20] through maybe 14 or 15.
[46:24] this was a period of my life that was
[46:26] very unsettled and the world around us
[46:28] there was a Cuban Missile Crisis the
[46:30] Cold War was full steam ahead uh but but
[46:34] in my personal life my older brother
[46:36] joined the Air Force
[46:39] my best friend since the second or third
[46:41] grade moved away
[46:43] we left the church we'd been attending
[46:45] since I was five or six years old and
[46:47] started going to a much more formal
[46:49] Church a Lutheran Church
[46:52] miles from home where I knew absolutely
[46:55] no one
[46:57] my parents who had a Baptist background
[47:00] had become aware of the Pentecostal
[47:03] movement we'd all been prayed for to
[47:06] receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[47:08] prophecies were being spoken
[47:11] healings in some cases miraculous
[47:14] healings were occurring
[47:16] there were tongues there was
[47:18] interpretation there was a feeling that
[47:20] imminent destruction was expected
[47:24] the Rapture could occur at any moment
[47:28] my parents were going to various prayer
[47:31] meetings and teachings
[47:33] many of those evenings I was home alone
[47:36] I was left behind
[47:40] I was convinced
[47:42] that I was the Lord's
[47:44] but I also knew that I harbored thoughts
[47:47] that I shouldn't
[47:48] did things that I knew better than to do
[47:52] the body changed I was going through at
[47:54] that age wasn't the one Paul refers to
[47:56] in the scripture but it was real
[47:57] nonetheless
[47:59] if my parents said the meeting was going
[48:02] to end at 8 30 and they'd be home by
[48:04] nine o'clock
[48:05] I started worrying at 901.
[48:08] they didn't show up
[48:10] by 9 15 I was certain
[48:13] I had missed the rapture
[48:15] and was doomed to go through the
[48:16] tribulation period without my parents
[48:19] without my family without those I loved
[48:23] those that I needed I'd be facing it
[48:26] alone
[48:28] I'd go to my room in tears praying
[48:30] asking God why he hadn't taken me to
[48:34] seeking his forgiveness
[48:36] frankly I was often terrified
[48:40] that's not what the Rapture is about
[48:43] so tonight let's talk a bit about this
[48:46] event that we call the rapture
[48:48] my prayer is that for any of you who may
[48:51] be anxious about it you'll be comforted
[48:55] reassured
[48:56] at peace
[48:58] and ready
[49:00] the rapture
[49:02] the catching away of the living faithful
[49:07] does it matter when it happens
[49:10] can we know ahead of time
[49:12] why do people keep trying to figure it
[49:14] out
[49:15] what difference would it make if they
[49:18] could or did
[49:19] what signs should we be looking for if
[49:22] any earthquakes Wars what
[49:27] and ultimately
[49:29] how do we prepare
[49:31] what is our role
[49:34] we'll be reading a lot of scripture this
[49:36] evening a few excerpts from Brother
[49:38] brannon's recorded messages and a short
[49:41] bit from the church age book
[49:43] the disciples asked Jesus about signs of
[49:47] his coming when it would happen about
[49:49] the destruction of Jerusalem that Jesus
[49:52] had just told them would occur in
[49:53] Matthew 24 we read this
[49:58] starting in verse 4.
[50:01] so the disciples asked his questions and
[50:03] Jesus answered and said unto them
[50:06] first thing he said take heed that no
[50:09] man deceive you
[50:11] they'll try
[50:13] be careful
[50:14] be wary
[50:16] don't fall for them many shall come in
[50:20] my name saying I am Christ
[50:22] that is I have the anointing I have the
[50:26] Revelation for you from God you need to
[50:28] listen to me
[50:31] and shall deceive many
[50:33] they'll be successful on their
[50:35] deceptions
[50:36] this is part of the reason Paul
[50:38] admonishes Timothy to study to be able
[50:40] to rightly divide the word of Truth
[50:44] he goes on you shall hear of wars
[50:48] and rumors of wars
[50:50] see that you be not troubled for all
[50:53] these things must come to pass
[50:55] but the end is not yet
[50:57] so Wars fighting amongst Empires Nations
[51:03] territories or even just reports of such
[51:06] activity aren't really signs
[51:09] they're human activities are far too
[51:11] normal
[51:12] and they're largely evil
[51:15] he goes on Nation will rise against
[51:18] Nation Kingdom against Kingdom
[51:21] and not only that but there'll be
[51:23] famines
[51:24] and pestilences and earthquakes in
[51:28] diverse places
[51:31] what Jesus is saying here is that people
[51:33] will be people they'll be fighting
[51:35] amongst quarreling with and killing each
[51:37] other
[51:38] Cain and Abel was the opening round
[51:41] we still see it today
[51:43] in Ukraine and many other places and we
[51:46] know it's root
[51:48] sin
[51:49] even before there were laws defining it
[51:52] God told Cain that sin was already there
[51:55] and that he must overcome it or he would
[51:58] be consumed by it
[52:01] weather events lead to crop failures and
[52:04] famines
[52:05] we read of many famines in the Bible
[52:07] from Genesis onwards we hear of food
[52:09] crises today
[52:11] all sorts of diseases and pandemics
[52:14] Spanish Flu just after World War One
[52:16] coveted the last couple of years AIDS
[52:20] Ebola
[52:22] these in our time and centuries past the
[52:25] plague every several hundred years would
[52:27] decimate populations if the plague hit
[52:30] Tucson like it did in England in the
[52:32] 1300s 50 percent of the city would be
[52:35] dead within 48 hours
[52:38] that's how virulent the plague was
[52:43] we hear more and more of earthquakes but
[52:46] we also have eight billion people on the
[52:48] planet not a few hundred million to feel
[52:51] the effects we have instant Global
[52:53] Communications instruments of amazing
[52:56] sensitivity capturing Quakes we wouldn't
[52:58] even otherwise be aware of
[53:01] plate tectonics it's how the planet was
[53:03] built by the Creator
[53:06] in other words these signs are generally
[53:09] nothing new they've continued on and
[53:12] they will continue on Jesus says so
[53:14] they're not really signs in that
[53:16] traditional sense
[53:17] oh you might say well be careful there
[53:20] brother Lyle you're sounding a bit like
[53:23] a scoffer have you never read second
[53:25] Peter three well I I think I have but
[53:28] let's read it together
[53:30] Peter says knowing this first that there
[53:34] shall come in the last days scoffers
[53:36] walking after their own lust and saying
[53:39] where is the promise of his coming
[53:41] since the fathers fell asleep all things
[53:43] continue as they were from the beginning
[53:45] of creation
[53:48] I'm not scoffing
[53:50] Peter goes on in that same passage to
[53:53] clarify not that the evidence being
[53:55] cited by the scoffers is
[53:58] necessarily incorrect but that they
[54:01] choose to be ignorant of God's purposes
[54:03] and his judgment
[54:05] they misinterpret and thus come to a
[54:08] wrong conclusion they reject the notion
[54:11] that there's a coming judgment rejecting
[54:13] that Christ is coming again where is the
[54:15] promise of his coming they ask after all
[54:17] he's as dead as our ancestors nothing's
[54:20] really changed
[54:23] Peter says for this they willingly are
[54:26] ignorant they choose to be ignorant of
[54:28] firstly creation and Judgment of the
[54:31] past that by the word of God the heavens
[54:34] were of old and the Earth standing out
[54:36] of the water and in the water whereby
[54:38] the world that then was being overflowed
[54:40] with water perished he's talking about
[54:43] the flood of course
[54:45] they reject that either this event
[54:47] happened or that it was judgment
[54:52] and another thing they're willingly
[54:54] ignorant of is that the same Creator is
[54:56] holding back judgment
[54:58] which will at the appropriate time be
[55:00] Unleashed Peter goes on in verse 7 but
[55:02] the heavens and the Earth which are now
[55:05] by the same word in the beginning was
[55:08] the word
[55:10] are kept in store reserved set aside
[55:13] unto another flood no reserved unto fire
[55:18] against the day of judgment and
[55:20] Perdition that word perdition means
[55:23] destruction the day of just of judgment
[55:26] and destruction of ungodly means impious
[55:30] Wicked irreverent men
[55:36] no scoffer here I'm emphatically saying
[55:39] he is returning I believe it's close
[55:43] but I'm also saying it's just as I
[55:45] believe Jesus did that these things that
[55:47] people point to is signs aren't signs in
[55:50] terms of precise timing
[55:52] we're to be people of faith
[55:54] not Seekers after science
[55:59] recall that trumpets
[56:01] which is the first fall feast day in
[56:03] which points to the return of Christ is
[56:05] uncertain in its timing
[56:07] it begins in and arises from Darkness
[56:10] the new moon
[56:17] Peter referenced destruction by water
[56:19] let's see what Jesus said about that
[56:21] continuing in Matthew 24 dropping down
[56:23] to verse 36.
[56:25] Jesus says of that day and hour knoweth
[56:28] no man
[56:30] no not the angels of heaven but my
[56:32] father only
[56:33] he keeps repeating that we will not know
[56:36] when the return of the Lord will happen
[56:39] until it happens
[56:41] he continues but as the days of Noah
[56:45] were
[56:46] so shall also the coming of the son of
[56:49] man be
[56:50] hmm
[56:51] he gives an example that they and we are
[56:54] familiar with he says for as in the days
[56:57] that were before the flood before that
[56:59] destruction
[57:00] before that judgment they were eating
[57:03] and drinking marrying and giving in
[57:06] marriage life went on
[57:09] normal routine
[57:12] nothing out of the ordinary except that
[57:14] crazy guy building a huge Wooden Boat
[57:16] talking about judgment and destruction
[57:19] because of how we live our evil
[57:21] imaginations always partying
[57:25] but notice what's missing in this
[57:27] description
[57:29] worship
[57:31] recognition of God
[57:33] humility
[57:35] Genesis 6 5 tells us God saw that the
[57:38] wickedness of man was great in the earth
[57:40] and that every imagination of the
[57:42] thoughts of his heart was only evil
[57:44] continually
[57:46] as it was
[57:47] and the days of Noah it's largely what
[57:50] Peter pointed out about the ones he
[57:52] called scoffers
[57:54] what Paul told Timothy about heavy
[57:56] high-minded lovers of pleasure and so
[57:58] forth
[57:59] hey
[58:00] this is America
[58:02] we fly rainbow Flags immerse ourselves
[58:05] in Hollywood fantasies and deny that
[58:07] there is a God but so what get real
[58:10] hmm
[58:12] until the day
[58:14] that Noah entered into the ark
[58:17] and it was another eight days
[58:20] before anything happened they didn't
[58:23] realize that the door had been sealed
[58:25] shut
[58:26] it wasn't raining when the door was shut
[58:28] and sealed
[58:30] hey
[58:32] old man with the zoo
[58:35] how's it smell in there anyway mucking
[58:38] out a lot of stalls are you sure we it
[58:41] was pretty nice out here upwind
[58:46] um
[58:47] a new knot until the flood came
[58:50] and took them away
[58:52] so shall also the coming of the son of
[58:55] man be
[58:57] in other words Jesus said things will
[59:00] seem to be as they always were until
[59:03] they aren't
[59:05] and while we've had the witness we
[59:07] talked about last time of Israel and the
[59:09] seventh Messenger to the churches to let
[59:11] us know it's near
[59:13] we can't be certain just how near
[59:18] when he comes it will be sudden how
[59:22] sudden verse 40 then shall two be in the
[59:24] field one shall be taken the other left
[59:27] two women shall be grinding at the Mill
[59:29] one shall be taken and the other left
[59:33] well look what Jesus says next watch
[59:36] therefore
[59:38] ye know not what hour your lord doth
[59:41] come and he isn't talking about your
[59:43] watch your GPS type keeping or a sundial
[59:46] don't get hung up on the word hour
[59:50] but know this
[59:52] he says here's something you can and
[59:54] should know you don't know when I'm
[59:55] coming but know this if the Goodman if
[59:58] the owner of the house had known in what
[1:00:00] watch which period of the night the
[1:00:02] thief would come
[1:00:04] he would have watched he would have been
[1:00:05] alert
[1:00:06] would not have suffered his house to be
[1:00:08] broken up
[1:00:10] therefore he says similarly be ye also
[1:00:14] ready
[1:00:15] stay alert
[1:00:16] remain alert
[1:00:19] for in such an hour as you think not
[1:00:22] he's talking to his disciples in such an
[1:00:25] hour as you think not when you least
[1:00:27] expect it the son of man is coming
[1:00:30] I will return
[1:00:32] here's another illustration Jesus goes
[1:00:35] on
[1:00:36] who then is a faithful and wise servant
[1:00:39] whom his Lord hath made ruler over his
[1:00:41] household to give the members of the
[1:00:43] household food in due season
[1:00:45] understanding all this how should you
[1:00:48] act
[1:00:49] blessed is that servant whom his Lord
[1:00:53] when he comes arriving unexpectedly
[1:00:56] shall find so doing
[1:00:59] going about his business
[1:01:01] verily I say unto you that he shall make
[1:01:04] him ruler over all his Goods
[1:01:07] Jesus goes on he contrasts that faithful
[1:01:10] servant with another kind
[1:01:12] but if that evil servant shall say in
[1:01:15] his heart my Lord delays his coming
[1:01:17] where is the promise of his coming the
[1:01:20] scoffers say
[1:01:21] hey maybe got caught up in some business
[1:01:24] or others not coming back I I'll know
[1:01:28] when he's on the road home I'm sure
[1:01:29] he'll signal ahead
[1:01:31] and shall begin to Smite his fellow
[1:01:33] servants
[1:01:34] to eat and drink with the drunken acts
[1:01:36] as if he has the authority meanwhile
[1:01:39] misbehaving abusing and mistreating
[1:01:41] others
[1:01:43] the Lord of that servant shall come in a
[1:01:45] day when he's not looking for him
[1:01:48] and an hour when he's not aware of
[1:01:51] he'll come he'll surprise him
[1:01:54] and shall kind of misunder that doesn't
[1:01:56] mean cut him in pieces slice and dice
[1:01:59] it's not talking about that it'll
[1:02:01] separate him from the Lord's House
[1:02:04] and a point in his portion with the
[1:02:06] hypocrites
[1:02:07] the actors make-believe insincere
[1:02:10] Pretenders
[1:02:12] fakes
[1:02:14] there shall be weeping and gnashing of
[1:02:15] teeth
[1:02:17] not a pleasant time
[1:02:20] Jesus emphasizes over and over
[1:02:23] that he'll come when he's least expected
[1:02:26] and that we cannot know ahead of time
[1:02:28] exactly when that might be he uses terms
[1:02:31] like the day or the hour and acts 1 7 he
[1:02:34] says we won't even know the times of the
[1:02:36] seasons
[1:02:37] much of this is idiom it's expression
[1:02:40] he's not talking about calendar dates or
[1:02:42] Shadows on a sundial
[1:02:45] if we skip to Matthew 25 he goes on
[1:02:48] there to warn that even though he has
[1:02:50] said that we should be ever Vigilant
[1:02:51] always watchful
[1:02:53] some of us won't be
[1:02:55] some will be tired
[1:02:57] exhausted
[1:02:59] weary
[1:03:03] start at verse 1.
[1:03:05] then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be
[1:03:07] likened unto ten virgins which shook
[1:03:09] their lamps and went forth to meet the
[1:03:11] bridegroom
[1:03:12] they wanted their light to shine they
[1:03:14] prepared themselves made themselves
[1:03:16] ready let clean Christian lives and
[1:03:18] wanted to see Jesus when he comes
[1:03:21] five of them were wise and five of them
[1:03:24] were foolish unwise
[1:03:27] they that were foolish took their lamps
[1:03:30] took no oil with them
[1:03:33] we discover a few verses down they had a
[1:03:35] little oil in the lamp initially
[1:03:38] but they didn't have a jar or a
[1:03:39] container for extra so they didn't have
[1:03:42] enough they assumed they wouldn't need
[1:03:44] more than what they had in the lamps
[1:03:46] themselves
[1:03:47] but the wise took oil in their vessels
[1:03:50] with their lamps they had a vessel other
[1:03:52] than the lamp that held more oil
[1:03:54] in July Heather and I were in in England
[1:03:57] and we went to the British Museum and I
[1:04:00] took a photograph here of of these
[1:04:03] various oil lamps all of oil lamps most
[1:04:06] of them are from the first century from
[1:04:08] the Mediterranean area Roman
[1:04:11] you can see that olive oil lamps come in
[1:04:14] variety of sizes and shapes but most
[1:04:16] didn't hold much oil
[1:04:18] I just get it enough to get you through
[1:04:21] the night get your PJs on
[1:04:23] go to bed
[1:04:25] the light goes out right
[1:04:27] many of the lamps are Roman first
[1:04:29] century current and Jesus time on the
[1:04:32] bottom left down here you can see that
[1:04:35] for those of you that are old enough it
[1:04:37] looks a bit like a hot water bottle but
[1:04:39] it's a it's a container to carry extra
[1:04:42] oil to to fill the lamp
[1:04:45] so the wives had these vessels with them
[1:04:48] the ones that are called foolish did it
[1:04:50] or if they did they were empty
[1:04:55] took his time
[1:04:56] Terry
[1:04:57] they all
[1:04:59] eventually slumbered and slipped
[1:05:02] you couldn't distinguish one from the
[1:05:03] other
[1:05:05] and at midnight there was a cry made
[1:05:07] behold the bridegroom cometh
[1:05:10] go out to meet him
[1:05:12] and then all those virgins arose all ten
[1:05:16] heard the cry and trimmed their lamps
[1:05:19] and and the foolish said to the wise
[1:05:20] oops
[1:05:22] give us if your oil our lamps have gone
[1:05:24] out
[1:05:27] they must have previously been burning
[1:05:28] to have gone out
[1:05:31] but the oil was consumed
[1:05:33] as they slumbered and slept but the wise
[1:05:36] answered saying
[1:05:37] nope
[1:05:39] not so lest there be not enough for us
[1:05:42] and you but go ye rather to them that
[1:05:45] sell and buy for yourselves there's oil
[1:05:47] available elsewhere
[1:05:49] go get some
[1:05:52] we just barely have enough for ourselves
[1:05:55] and while they went to buy
[1:05:58] the bridegroom showed up
[1:06:00] and they that were ready went in with
[1:06:02] him to the marriage
[1:06:05] they
[1:06:06] that were ready
[1:06:08] and the door was shut
[1:06:11] as in the days of Noah God shut the door
[1:06:15] before judgment and destruction
[1:06:18] afterward also came the other virgin
[1:06:20] saying Lord Lord open to us but he
[1:06:23] answered and said verily I say to you I
[1:06:26] I know you're not
[1:06:28] watch therefore Jesus says I've told you
[1:06:31] this story why because I want you to
[1:06:34] watch because you know neither the day
[1:06:36] nor the hour
[1:06:38] wherein the son of man cometh again the
[1:06:41] warning the uncertainty beforehand
[1:06:45] brother Branham talks about this Parable
[1:06:47] when asked about it in March 1963 in a
[1:06:51] recording titled questions and answers
[1:06:52] on the seals
[1:06:54] recall that sometimes he spoke about one
[1:06:57] in a million there were two that made it
[1:06:59] out of 2 million into the promised land
[1:07:01] there were eight that made it out of
[1:07:03] eight million in the days of Noah he
[1:07:05] talks about one in a million but
[1:07:07] remember he also said when he described
[1:07:10] his experience that he called beyond the
[1:07:12] curtain of time that there were Millions
[1:07:14] present just from this age
[1:07:21] questions and answers on the seals the
[1:07:23] question
[1:07:24] are the five wise versions of Matthew 25
[1:07:28] attendance to the bride
[1:07:31] or are they the bride
[1:07:33] if these wise virgins are attendance to
[1:07:35] the bride where's the bride
[1:07:39] so the person is asking a question
[1:07:41] they're a little confused brother
[1:07:43] Brandon says see now to the best of my
[1:07:45] understanding
[1:07:46] these five virgins There Were Ten of
[1:07:48] them you know that went out see this is
[1:07:51] only a symbol or a parable see that I'm
[1:07:53] going to tell you see there were 10 of
[1:07:55] them of course there were more than ten
[1:07:56] this was just a made number but then the
[1:08:01] wise virgins had oil in their lamps the
[1:08:04] unwise did not have oil in their laps
[1:08:08] so if that tender of Matthew if this is
[1:08:11] a person's question if those tend there
[1:08:13] did that mean that there would be or
[1:08:15] these five that there would be just five
[1:08:16] see five people is is the bride just
[1:08:20] going to be five people is what they're
[1:08:22] asking brother random says no it doesn't
[1:08:25] mean that it's just a simple
[1:08:27] aversions you see of the Virgin that
[1:08:29] went out with oil on their lamp
[1:08:31] they're a portion of that bride
[1:08:34] in the church age book in the section on
[1:08:37] the sartigian church age we think of as
[1:08:40] the first fifth Church age under Luther
[1:08:43] it says
[1:08:47] it's a second Resurrection where in the
[1:08:50] five foolish virgins come up
[1:08:52] note they were virgins they did not have
[1:08:54] the Holy Spirit so they missed being in
[1:08:55] the bride while the five wives who had
[1:08:58] oil became part of that bride but these
[1:09:00] people being a separated god-loving
[1:09:02] people trying to abide in the word
[1:09:04] according to what they knew of it and
[1:09:06] being a help in the work of the Lord
[1:09:08] will come up at the end of time
[1:09:10] they'll miss the Millennium all these
[1:09:12] people had their names in The Book of
[1:09:14] Life and their names remained
[1:09:19] well the takeaway from this I think
[1:09:23] is that it is of utmost importance
[1:09:25] to receive the baptism of the holy
[1:09:27] spirit in our lives
[1:09:29] keep our vessels full
[1:09:32] our lights shining
[1:09:37] is there something else that we must do
[1:09:39] to prepare ourselves to be ready for the
[1:09:42] catching away
[1:09:44] do we have a role
[1:09:48] we'll go back to questions and answers
[1:09:50] on this heels excuse me
[1:09:57] I want to read this with you
[1:09:59] it's a little long
[1:10:01] but I think it's really important
[1:10:04] we live in a time of confusion
[1:10:06] being assaulted constantly with the
[1:10:09] influence of Satan's Eden
[1:10:11] tension in the world economic chaos it
[1:10:14] seems like it's descending everywhere
[1:10:17] but my brothers and sisters now more
[1:10:19] than ever
[1:10:21] we need to keep our eyes on Jesus
[1:10:23] laser focused on him
[1:10:26] we need to have oil in our lamps the
[1:10:29] infilling of the Holy Spirit
[1:10:31] and keep our lamps lit
[1:10:34] we need to find our place in the body of
[1:10:37] Christ and be present doing what he's
[1:10:41] called each one of us to do
[1:10:45] I'm getting ahead of myself let's read
[1:10:49] questions and answers on the seals the
[1:10:52] question is
[1:10:54] should evangelists continue on the field
[1:10:59] in this hour of course what they mean
[1:11:01] certainly by all means
[1:11:04] don't change a thing
[1:11:07] I I hope you hear this next sentence and
[1:11:10] are listening very very closely
[1:11:12] if that one sentence is all you get from
[1:11:15] tonight's service really sinking in and
[1:11:17] taking root it will have been worth
[1:11:19] coming
[1:11:20] he says if Jesus is coming in the
[1:11:23] morning
[1:11:24] preached today like if it was going to
[1:11:27] be 10 years from today but live like
[1:11:30] it's going to be this hour
[1:11:36] he goes on he says don't get scrupled up
[1:11:39] now don't get all confused and twisted
[1:11:41] around that's what I'm trying to warn
[1:11:44] you about see
[1:11:45] just don't be odd peculiar
[1:11:48] don't change nothing
[1:11:50] but if you're doing something wrong or
[1:11:52] doing evil repent see
[1:11:55] come back to God
[1:11:57] continue on your Evangelistic service
[1:11:59] just as you always did
[1:12:02] now remember this is in 1963 this is
[1:12:05] after the seals this is years after he
[1:12:08] talked about 1956.
[1:12:10] he says go on
[1:12:13] keep doing it
[1:12:15] he's telling us we can't sit back in our
[1:12:17] cocoons bring our hands and say it's too
[1:12:21] late for fill in the blank
[1:12:24] that's what the enemy wants us to do
[1:12:27] is to give up and he'll use scripture
[1:12:30] and quotes and what have you to get us
[1:12:32] to sit back and go to sleep to just let
[1:12:35] the world go by
[1:12:38] brother Branham says if you're building
[1:12:40] a house I don't see brother Amos Garcia
[1:12:43] here but I do see brother Peter
[1:12:46] put it on up
[1:12:48] Jesus comes tomorrow you be found
[1:12:51] faithful at that Duty If You're Building
[1:12:53] a Church go on put it up
[1:12:57] I'd rather be putting my money in
[1:12:59] something like that than be found with
[1:13:01] it in my pocket see
[1:13:05] so just keep on
[1:13:07] continue as you are
[1:13:10] everybody understand now continue right
[1:13:13] on just go on right on as you are now
[1:13:17] just don't stop don't do nothing just go
[1:13:21] right on just as you are keep on serving
[1:13:24] the lord
[1:13:25] brother Branham hits this point over and
[1:13:28] over and over
[1:13:30] now for instance if he was working for a
[1:13:34] man and you note it was 15 minutes
[1:13:36] before quitting time well you'd say it's
[1:13:38] just 15 minutes more might as well just
[1:13:40] go over and sit down next to the time
[1:13:42] clock be the first guy to punch out
[1:13:45] you could docked for that 15 minutes
[1:13:47] the first real job that I had was for an
[1:13:50] aircraft company here in town and there
[1:13:52] were so many people that were doing this
[1:13:53] kind of thing that the guy that owned
[1:13:55] the company told the foreman first
[1:13:57] person that punches out tomorrow fire
[1:13:59] him on the spot
[1:14:00] they later set up a thing where 15
[1:14:02] minutes before quitting time they'd blow
[1:14:04] a whistle so you could clean up your
[1:14:06] tools but if you were cleaning up 16
[1:14:08] minutes before that whistle or 16
[1:14:10] minutes before quitting you were in
[1:14:12] trouble
[1:14:13] okay
[1:14:17] if you're planting wheat
[1:14:19] plant your wheat
[1:14:22] if you're digging potatoes I I was
[1:14:24] originally thinking of entitling this
[1:14:26] sermon spuds but I thought that'd be a
[1:14:29] little confusing a little too cute he
[1:14:31] says if you're digging potatoes go on
[1:14:33] dig them out say well nobody will eat
[1:14:37] them don't make any difference
[1:14:39] dig them out anyhow see yeah just
[1:14:42] continue on As You Are
[1:14:45] I got a letter from somebody the other
[1:14:47] day somebody told them say well the time
[1:14:50] is at hand sell the farm you won't need
[1:14:52] the food you live off of on the farm
[1:14:54] because this Millennium is going to
[1:14:56] start you won't need it so just go ahead
[1:14:59] and while the tribulation period is
[1:15:01] going on you your children is not safe
[1:15:03] so let the children have a farm where
[1:15:05] they can eat off of it but sell your
[1:15:07] farm or something like that
[1:15:09] oh they had it I said oh my
[1:15:14] if I knowed he was coming tomorrow and I
[1:15:17] was a farmer I'd put in my crop today
[1:15:21] sure if he made me a farmer I'm gonna
[1:15:25] stay right at my duty
[1:15:27] that's right if he made me a mechanic
[1:15:32] somebody said the other day he said
[1:15:35] a fellow come in and said say brother
[1:15:37] you know what he said I'm going to give
[1:15:39] you the second set of keys I bought a
[1:15:41] new car he said I'm going to give you
[1:15:43] the second set of keys told his Pastor
[1:15:45] said I'm going to give you the second
[1:15:47] set of keys because the Rapture might
[1:15:49] come you know and said I won't be
[1:15:51] needing it anymore
[1:15:52] Pastor was going to miss it see oh
[1:15:55] that's making ready isn't it all right
[1:15:58] but that's the way it is see we mustn't
[1:16:01] be that way
[1:16:04] we must be a sane solid Christian see
[1:16:09] that I'm put here to work right up to
[1:16:12] the last minute
[1:16:14] I've got a job to do and I'll be right
[1:16:17] found faithful at the post of Duty
[1:16:19] if he comes this morning I want to be
[1:16:22] standing right here in the pulpit
[1:16:25] anybody here remember 1981 here in
[1:16:30] Tucson
[1:16:31] June 28th Sunday was when the Rapture
[1:16:35] was scheduled to take place
[1:16:39] according to a local Evangelist named
[1:16:41] Bill Maupin and his small group of
[1:16:43] followers
[1:16:45] I remember meeting Bill sometime back in
[1:16:47] 1970. a recent convert to Christ very
[1:16:51] enthusiastic person he'd learned to
[1:16:53] Divine Healing and at that time he was
[1:16:55] planning on going through every hospital
[1:16:57] in Tucson and emptying them
[1:16:59] that was the kind of person that he was
[1:17:01] that's what he related to me
[1:17:04] well in June 28 1981 approached his
[1:17:09] followers quit their jobs
[1:17:11] sold their houses and so forth they
[1:17:13] printed a 274-page guide for those left
[1:17:16] behind on what to do during the Great
[1:17:18] Tribulation
[1:17:20] when the Rapture didn't happen he
[1:17:23] recalculated the date to be August 7th
[1:17:25] 1981.
[1:17:28] when it didn't happen then he just said
[1:17:30] it would happen soon and that the date
[1:17:32] wasn't really very important anyway
[1:17:35] I saw lots of t-shirts back then mocking
[1:17:38] it all the legend and large letters that
[1:17:40] I survived the Rapture with people
[1:17:42] floating up in the sky and it had June
[1:17:45] 28th crossed out and it had August 7th
[1:17:48] crossed out
[1:17:50] some people at work were wearing those
[1:17:51] t-shirts and just making fun of the
[1:17:53] whole thing
[1:17:57] I ran across a blogger who saved
[1:17:59] newspaper clippings of those predictions
[1:18:01] and mistakes and that person wrote in in
[1:18:03] 2012
[1:18:05] there have been a lot of raptures since
[1:18:07] then and whenever they've come along I
[1:18:09] thought of all Bill Maupin and these
[1:18:11] clippings in a way listen to this now
[1:18:14] this is what brother Brandon was
[1:18:15] pointing out in a way the non-event
[1:18:18] helped me become a skeptic
[1:18:21] help me understand how ridiculous
[1:18:22] religious people can be and how Shifty
[1:18:25] their Advocates are when they're proven
[1:18:28] wrong
[1:18:30] it didn't happen on October 22nd 1844 as
[1:18:33] the Miller rights predicted
[1:18:35] we know it didn't happen in 1975 or 77
[1:18:38] or 81 or 2011 or any of the other dates
[1:18:41] put forward
[1:18:43] a few months ago a very sincere brother
[1:18:46] came to the Tabernacle later and asked
[1:18:48] the ministry team to meet with them
[1:18:50] he let out a year it would happen 2024
[1:18:53] 2026 I forgotten exactly based on an
[1:18:56] interpretation of the Book of Daniel
[1:19:00] another brother came to me and was
[1:19:02] certain it had to happen before mid-2028
[1:19:05] and explained his reasoning
[1:19:07] nothing wrong with his reasoning I love
[1:19:10] and respect that brother
[1:19:12] but Jesus made it clear no one knows the
[1:19:15] day or the hour
[1:19:17] it'll happen when it happens
[1:19:20] trying to guess or figure out some date
[1:19:22] should not be our Focus
[1:19:25] will be wrong let's get back to what
[1:19:27] brother Branham said here you say
[1:19:28] brother Branham if he was to come this
[1:19:31] morning shouldn't you be out there
[1:19:33] no sir
[1:19:35] this is my poster Duty I'll be standing
[1:19:38] right here preaching now he's not making
[1:19:40] a prophecy that he'll be alive when
[1:19:42] Jesus comes and he'll be preaching in
[1:19:43] the Pulpit at Branham Tabernacle that's
[1:19:45] not the point that he's making
[1:19:48] he's illustrating I'll be standing right
[1:19:50] here preaching when he comes saying the
[1:19:53] same things I am then when he comes I'll
[1:19:56] just move right on out with him see
[1:19:59] if I'm hoeing potatoes
[1:20:01] I'll just be hoeing away
[1:20:03] just as hard as I can
[1:20:05] when he comes
[1:20:07] I'll just drop the hoe and take off
[1:20:10] remember in the Jubilee year if they was
[1:20:13] hoeing with a hoe they just kept on
[1:20:16] hoeing they know the Jubilee year was
[1:20:18] maybe 10 minutes more and the trumpet
[1:20:20] will sound at the Jubilee year
[1:20:22] they just kept on pitching hay whatever
[1:20:25] they was doing
[1:20:26] but when the trumpet sounded then they
[1:20:29] dropped the Pitchfork and gone
[1:20:31] see that's it just keep on pitching hay
[1:20:34] until the trumpet sounds
[1:20:37] all right
[1:20:42] there's a tremendous amount of very good
[1:20:44] advice there
[1:20:46] the final scripture selection from the
[1:20:48] New Testament I want to share this
[1:20:50] evening is found in first Thessalonians
[1:20:52] chapter 4 we're all familiar with it
[1:20:56] the context
[1:20:57] is Paul comforting those who are in
[1:20:59] mourning at the passing of a loved one
[1:21:01] without the Lord was coming and these
[1:21:03] person has died and and what's going on
[1:21:06] and are they going to go to hell because
[1:21:08] they miss the Rapture and Paul what's
[1:21:09] going on we're very concerned
[1:21:12] what's going on
[1:21:15] confusion
[1:21:17] despair
[1:21:18] survivor's guilt discouragement
[1:21:22] disillusionment
[1:21:24] questioning God's reliability his word
[1:21:27] all the emotions that one experiences at
[1:21:30] such times
[1:21:32] first Thessalonians 4 13.
[1:21:35] Paul says I would not have you to be
[1:21:37] ignorant
[1:21:39] to be uninformed
[1:21:41] to be unaware
[1:21:42] to be in darkness or confused concerning
[1:21:46] them which are asleep
[1:21:47] those that have passed away
[1:21:49] whose bodies have died
[1:21:52] because if you're not ignorant but
[1:21:54] informed the result is that you sorrow
[1:21:56] not
[1:21:57] even as others which have no hope
[1:22:02] we have hope
[1:22:03] faith is the substance of Our Hope
[1:22:07] for if we believe that Jesus died and
[1:22:10] rose again
[1:22:14] do we believe that two thousand years
[1:22:16] later do we believe that he's alive two
[1:22:19] thousand years after Paul penned these
[1:22:21] words to a group of grieving Believers
[1:22:23] in Thessaloniki
[1:22:26] do we believe that Jesus died for our
[1:22:28] sins that he rose on the third day
[1:22:30] that he's alive in October of 2022
[1:22:34] that he's given us his holy spirit a
[1:22:37] portion of the very essence of the god
[1:22:39] that created the universe who transcends
[1:22:42] space and time
[1:22:45] that he loves us so much
[1:22:47] he paid that awful price on our behalf
[1:22:51] while we were yet ignorant
[1:22:53] if we believe that then even so them
[1:22:58] also would sleep in Jesus will God bring
[1:23:01] with him
[1:23:02] that sounds fantastic right
[1:23:06] so Paul goes on to explain the process
[1:23:08] by which it will occur
[1:23:11] for this we say unto you by the word of
[1:23:14] the Lord Paul says the same one who met
[1:23:16] me on the road to Damascus the same one
[1:23:19] that has given me the strength and power
[1:23:20] to preach his gospel with the same
[1:23:22] intensity with which I once persecuted
[1:23:24] it he told me
[1:23:26] that we
[1:23:28] Paul says we you say I hope to be a part
[1:23:31] of the living at his return but
[1:23:32] regardless we which are alive and remain
[1:23:37] unto the coming of the Lord shall not
[1:23:39] prevent hinder stop delay interfere with
[1:23:43] them which are asleep the dead in Christ
[1:23:47] for the Lord himself
[1:23:49] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[1:23:52] with the voice of the Archangel with the
[1:23:55] Trump of God
[1:23:56] and the dead in Christ
[1:23:58] shall rise first
[1:24:00] brother Branham drawing on the time
[1:24:03] between Christ's resurrection and
[1:24:05] Ascension being 40 days
[1:24:07] believe that this phase of the Rapture
[1:24:09] the dead in Christ Rising would happen a
[1:24:11] minimum of 40 days before the catching
[1:24:13] away
[1:24:14] of the next verse
[1:24:17] then after the dead in Christ are
[1:24:20] resurrected and Incorruptible bodies we
[1:24:22] which are alive and remain shall be
[1:24:26] changed in a moment as Paul told us in
[1:24:29] our opening verses in First Corinthians
[1:24:31] 15. and we'll be caught up together with
[1:24:33] them in the clouds to meet the Lord in
[1:24:35] the air
[1:24:36] so shall we ever be with the Lord we
[1:24:39] show we won't forever be in clouds will
[1:24:41] forever be with the Lord
[1:24:43] and Paul says you're grieving wherefore
[1:24:46] Comfort one another with these words
[1:24:51] don't fear if you pass away in Christ
[1:24:54] you're going to be there
[1:24:56] if you're alive and filled with the Holy
[1:24:59] Spirit called by God you're going to be
[1:25:02] there
[1:25:02] you are not going to miss it Jesus said
[1:25:05] all the father hath given me will come
[1:25:07] and I won't lose even one
[1:25:13] that's why Paul was sharing this
[1:25:15] revelation
[1:25:16] comfort and time of mourning if
[1:25:20] musicians would please come at this time
[1:25:22] there was another one it was in deep
[1:25:25] mourning in grief centuries earlier
[1:25:28] and this is what he wrote
[1:25:30] job 19 23. oh that my words were now
[1:25:35] written that that they were printed in a
[1:25:38] book that they were Graven with an iron
[1:25:41] pen and lead in the rock forever
[1:25:45] job wants his testimony and his faith
[1:25:48] recorded he wants people including his
[1:25:51] detractors and the Skeptics surrounding
[1:25:53] him to know where he stands where his
[1:25:56] confidence lies and he then declares
[1:25:59] that testimony his his statement of
[1:26:01] faith if you will
[1:26:02] for I hope no
[1:26:06] I think
[1:26:08] I suspect
[1:26:10] no
[1:26:12] Beyond any Shadow of Doubt I know that
[1:26:15] my redeemer
[1:26:17] My Redeemer my personal savior he's
[1:26:20] saying is this idea of a personal savior
[1:26:22] is not a new testament Christian thing
[1:26:24] this is going all the way back to
[1:26:26] ancient times job is talking about his
[1:26:29] personal savior
[1:26:31] his Redeemer liveth and that he shall
[1:26:34] stand at the latter day upon the Earth
[1:26:36] exactly what Jesus said exactly what the
[1:26:40] Angels told the disciples who witnessed
[1:26:41] Jesus Ascension said exactly what Paul
[1:26:45] wrote what Peter declared were not
[1:26:47] cunningly devised Fables
[1:26:50] job goes on and though after my skin
[1:26:53] worms destroy this body
[1:26:56] after my flesh is rotted decayed from my
[1:26:59] bones the insect larva have consumed my
[1:27:02] body and recycled my elements yet in my
[1:27:05] flesh
[1:27:06] shall I see God
[1:27:09] for this corruption will take on
[1:27:12] incorruption as how Paul expressed the
[1:27:14] same concept the same thing
[1:27:16] whom I shall see for myself
[1:27:22] Jesus expressed this concept to his
[1:27:24] disciples when he told them our friend
[1:27:26] Lazarus sleeps
[1:27:28] mine eyes Shall Behold and not another
[1:27:31] though my Reigns the concept is vital
[1:27:34] organs be consumed within me
[1:27:37] regardless of the Decay and even absence
[1:27:40] of My corruptable Flesh job said I will
[1:27:43] be there
[1:27:45] job had that confidence that faith
[1:27:49] that Revelation he wasn't looking for a
[1:27:51] rapture
[1:27:53] but a resurrection thousands of years
[1:27:55] later
[1:27:56] we're told that some will still be alive
[1:27:58] when the dead in Christ rise
[1:28:00] and in their then Incorruptible bodies
[1:28:03] each will behold along with job his
[1:28:07] Redeemer
[1:28:08] not just his Redeemer his savior the
[1:28:12] lover of our soul
[1:28:14] we may well be part of that generation
[1:28:17] but we should not let the awe of that
[1:28:20] possibility distract us from being about
[1:28:23] our father's business brother Branham
[1:28:26] said over and over just keep on what the
[1:28:30] Lord has called you to do keep doing it
[1:28:33] we're called to be the salt of the earth
[1:28:36] a Shining Light his Witnesses
[1:28:39] to be people of faith
[1:28:42] to keep hope in our potatoes
[1:28:46] let's pray together one more time
[1:28:50] Lord Jesus
[1:28:53] I pray that something has been said
[1:28:55] tonight that will help someone
[1:28:58] may be struggling someone may be
[1:29:00] questioning I don't know but you do
[1:29:03] Lord I pray that you'd reach down
[1:29:06] and for each one that's here Lord
[1:29:08] that has the holy spirit that you would
[1:29:10] give them that reassurance
[1:29:12] that they're not going to miss it they
[1:29:15] are going to make it you won't lose one
[1:29:17] if there's anyone here that hasn't
[1:29:19] received the Holy Spirit that you'd move
[1:29:22] in their heart and in their life in such
[1:29:23] a way that they would want it and they
[1:29:26] would reach out and not stop until they
[1:29:28] get it
[1:29:29] Lord
[1:29:30] I just commit these thoughts and this
[1:29:33] evening to you I thank you for your word
[1:29:36] I thank you for your presence I thank
[1:29:37] you for your profit I thank you for this
[1:29:40] congregation this church this this
[1:29:43] faithful group that stands together Lord
[1:29:45] in your name and we ask these things in
[1:29:49] your name
[1:29:49] [Music]
[1:29:52] as brother Aaron comes to conclude this
[1:29:54] evening's Gathering
[1:29:56] maybe we could sing Keep Your Eyes Upon
[1:29:58] Jesus
[1:30:00] that's where we need to have our Focus
[1:30:02] [Music]
[1:30:08] on wrong key
[1:30:10] Keep Your Eyes Upon
[1:30:15] Jesus
[1:30:18] look full in his wonderful faith
[1:30:25] foreign
[1:30:27] strangely
[1:30:28] [Music]
[1:30:34] [Music]
[1:30:37] in the light of his glory
[1:30:42] and grace and you know why I'm not a
[1:30:45] song leader brother Aaron
[1:30:49] Jesus
[1:30:59] [Music]
[1:31:03] afraid
[1:31:07] and the things of Earth
[1:31:12] will grow
[1:31:14] strangely dim in the
[1:31:19] lives
[1:31:21] one more time
[1:31:28] Turn Your Eyes Upon James
[1:31:34] [Music]
[1:31:46] I'm the things
[1:31:50] [Music]
[1:32:06] as I look out and I
[1:32:08] I see you know a lot of us have served
[1:32:12] the Lord maybe our whole lives we are
[1:32:14] raised in some
[1:32:16] seen Mom and Dad probably the oldest
[1:32:19] ones here today and I know Dad and Mom
[1:32:21] gave their hearts to the Lord
[1:32:23] as young people
[1:32:26] but you know the workers pay is the same
[1:32:28] in the 11th Hour the reward is the same
[1:32:33] you know that the thief on the side when
[1:32:36] Jesus say this day you'll be meet me in
[1:32:38] Paradise
[1:32:39] you know his stay in Paradise was really
[1:32:41] short
[1:32:43] While others have been in there for many
[1:32:45] years but it was the same
[1:32:47] it's the same pay for everyone
[1:32:51] to all that we will believe
[1:32:55] we were here in the meetings of 76 going
[1:32:58] into 77 this church was packed are you
[1:33:01] here man this church was packed there
[1:33:04] was there was no room in the church
[1:33:08] a brother stood behind the pulpit
[1:33:09] administered
[1:33:12] and and there was such an expectation
[1:33:14] for 77.
[1:33:18] and another brother stood up and spoke
[1:33:20] in tongues
[1:33:21] and another brother interpreted
[1:33:24] the interpretation was something along
[1:33:26] this line of get ready we're down to our
[1:33:29] last couple of days you better be ready
[1:33:31] 77 is just a few days down here
[1:33:35] there was somewhere between 120 and 130
[1:33:39] rebaptisms at night
[1:33:42] appearing including myself
[1:33:45] and then it didn't happen
[1:33:49] got to talk to folks after that
[1:33:52] and asking where is so and so I haven't
[1:33:55] seen them anymore where are they they
[1:33:56] haven't been back to church they said it
[1:33:59] didn't happen in 77 and they gave up
[1:34:04] I know a young man whose father was one
[1:34:07] of the deacons at Branham Tabernacle I
[1:34:09] worked with him and he told me what life
[1:34:12] was that right before 77 they got
[1:34:15] married at 15 and 16 years old so they
[1:34:17] could be married before God came
[1:34:20] they quit their jobs they stopped going
[1:34:22] to school
[1:34:24] I asked him what's like for that later
[1:34:26] he said life was a mess
[1:34:29] we're not looking into what man's
[1:34:30] interpretation we're looking to what the
[1:34:32] scripture says
[1:34:34] and the spirit of Christ in you should
[1:34:36] be saying Amen to the word of God
[1:34:39] look up your Redemption draweth nigh
[1:34:44] but brother Graham says keep doing what
[1:34:45] you do keep going keep being a Christian
[1:34:48] keep being friendly to your neighbor
[1:34:51] keep being a good worker do those things
[1:34:54] that would cause somebody to come up to
[1:34:56] you say how can you live this way in
[1:34:59] such a time and then you can share that
[1:35:02] God in your life to him
[1:35:05] that's what he asked us to do you know
[1:35:08] I've
[1:35:09] brother Dan you've heard many of the
[1:35:11] things that have been said in this
[1:35:13] message over the years
[1:35:16] he was coming this time he was coming
[1:35:18] here he was but you know he is coming
[1:35:22] he has come and be ready
[1:35:24] lift up your head Redemption draweth
[1:35:26] nigh
[1:35:27] could this be the morning you wake up oh
[1:35:29] Lord could this be the day Lord then let
[1:35:32] me go this day in your name and go forth
[1:35:34] proclaiming that Jesus Christ is alive
[1:35:37] today
[1:35:39] the day that he does come and take us
[1:35:41] home
[1:35:42] I'll believe that and
[1:35:44] it could share some experience of things
[1:35:46] and people that happened
[1:35:48] those that say we're in the Millennium
[1:35:50] now those that whatever they say
[1:35:54] just trim your lamps and be ready Lord
[1:35:56] am I staying true to what you've called
[1:35:58] me to do my is the love of God flowing
[1:36:01] my heart would I be willing
[1:36:04] I was talking with my wife yesterday
[1:36:06] wasn't it
[1:36:08] and you know we shall we will be there
[1:36:11] at that judgment and and it says to them
[1:36:13] was granted
[1:36:15] life
[1:36:16] and I thought to myself I was telling my
[1:36:18] wife I said
[1:36:19] if I was standing there in the Lord as
[1:36:21] part of the Bride the Lord would say now
[1:36:23] they're they're being judged
[1:36:25] and he would ask me well do they deserve
[1:36:28] heaven or not
[1:36:31] could I honestly know Lord send him to
[1:36:34] hell
[1:36:35] if I had that attitude now
[1:36:38] or that and then that means I had that
[1:36:39] attitude now and I'd say Lord help me
[1:36:43] Lord can I reach out and bring one more
[1:36:45] can I reach out and and draw another one
[1:36:47] home
[1:36:48] I I'll just I'll just be honest I'd
[1:36:52] finished ministering one service
[1:36:54] came walking around the back and I was
[1:36:56] just stepping out the side there
[1:36:58] and a young sister passed by and then
[1:37:00] she just muttered we might as well give
[1:37:03] up and just quit if it's like that
[1:37:06] and I thought my what did I preach that
[1:37:08] I would have given somebody that
[1:37:10] attitude
[1:37:11] so I said sister what was that for
[1:37:15] and she said well the brother just told
[1:37:16] me well 63 came and Jesus came and
[1:37:18] there's no use even trying to save a
[1:37:20] soul today
[1:37:22] I said Lord help us Lord how many came
[1:37:26] in after 63
