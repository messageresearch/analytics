[12:58] [Music]
[13:04] amen there's so many things happening in
[13:07] this world
[13:08] today today looks stable and tomorrow
[13:11] it's
[13:12] gone what's happening in the Middle East
[13:14] from one day to the next changes so
[13:17] quickly but he's the same yesterday
[13:19] today and forever
[13:22] so have some requests I missed a couple
[13:26] of
[13:27] services don't know really what it was
[13:29] was but it left me weak not much
[13:32] energy no no strength and the whole
[13:35] right side of my body was just congested
[13:37] and
[13:38] all and because there's only two of us
[13:41] working we had to work work through that
[13:44] but he's still our healer he doesn't
[13:47] change no matter what happens in this
[13:50] earth and if on this this planet if
[13:53] you're reading the news and paying
[13:54] attention it just seems like one thing
[13:56] after another
[13:58] continually but my hope is in the Lord
[14:02] amen it's um it it's something that
[14:07] probably we take for granted at
[14:09] times the fact that he knows us and we
[14:12] know him and there are those who don't
[14:15] know him he knows everyone but they
[14:17] don't know him by the grace of we God by
[14:20] grace of God we have we have a praise
[14:22] from Sister
[14:23] Melia and
[14:26] uh I appreciate
[14:29] the
[14:31] Praises because it's giving testimony of
[14:33] what God has done and you know I uh I
[14:36] did something I'd never done before this
[14:38] past week in fact it took 65 years to do
[14:41] it we turned
[14:44] 65 and
[14:47] um I've had I've had quite a few
[14:50] warnings of the things that began to
[14:51] happen after that and they're
[14:54] true but I asked my daughter Abby I said
[14:58] how how do old do the kids think I am
[15:01] and Chloe said
[15:04] 40 and of course 40 is old to them and
[15:08] Asher I thought he said 25 and I said
[15:12] well they got it right and she goes no
[15:13] he said
[15:14] 45 so I made it
[15:17] 85 but I thank the god I thank God for
[15:20] life and for health and and uh the
[15:23] privilege to live this long and to come
[15:27] I believe closer to that day
[15:30] that it'll all be over and it'll be
[15:32] worth it all from Sister Amelia she says
[15:36] thank you
[15:38] Lord I
[15:40] usually I usually know when a blessing
[15:42] is on the way from the way people treat
[15:45] me during the week I cried and sighed
[15:49] and and hoped for better
[15:53] days then I come to Wednesday night
[15:56] service and receive blessings
[15:59] that leave me in
[16:00] awe I love the Lord with all my heart
[16:04] and know that he always is mindful of me
[16:09] I love you all with a Godly love and
[16:12] pray that God will bless you all as he
[16:16] continues to bless me thank you for your
[16:20] prayers and for being mindful of me
[16:23] sister
[16:25] Amelia and you know when one part of the
[16:27] body suffers the rest of the body
[16:30] suffers so it's just good to have a
[16:32] praise
[16:34] [Music]
[16:37] um so would you kind to note the it 10
[16:40] west is shut down so there are some who
[16:42] are stuck in traffic
[16:44] jam you know and sometimes we can get
[16:47] angry about it but there's reason for
[16:50] everything yeah okay you just you might
[16:53] sit there for an extra 20 minutes on in
[16:55] the freeway and yeah that's aggravating
[16:57] but maybe take some time to thank the
[16:59] Lord and pray and and give him glory and
[17:01] watch the 20 minutes go by
[17:03] quickly still 20 minutes whether you're
[17:05] angry or not but when you're angry they
[17:08] seem to go 40 or 50 yeah that's kind of
[17:11] strange how that
[17:12] works from Sister Zyra asked prayer for
[17:15] her uncle unspoken
[17:18] request She also asked prayer for her
[17:20] stepfather's daughter-in-law she was
[17:23] diagnosed with thyroid
[17:25] [Music]
[17:27] cancer brother Ed is asking us to
[17:30] remember sister Kathy dugall in prayer

[17:33] from the Master's Hand and also her for
[17:37] Lance their grandson to remember him in

[17:43] yesterday was went to for
[17:46] dialysis and the if you saw it on the
[17:49] the system went down at the dialysis
[17:53] center and uh they were told they would
[17:55] not be able to dilize till Monday and
[17:58] when your carrying a lot of fluid that
[18:00] that gets very difficult and um so she
[18:04] went to uh St Mary's Hospital they have
[18:08] a dialysis center there and they told
[18:10] her to wait they might be able to get
[18:11] her in and she ended up spending the
[18:14] night there and they when to di dialight
[18:16] her this
[18:18] morning things we take for granted that

[18:23] the body doesn't work we
[18:25] suffer and so just asking him
[18:29] uh prayer for her and my wife who spent

[20:34] body that could be feel what we

[38:58] this uh this next chapter in James so
[39:00] we've been going through the Book of
[39:01] James we obviously started with chapter
[39:04] one and and we're continuing on and uh
[39:07] today we fall on chapter three and
[39:10] chapter three I'm I guess I'm glad to
[39:13] say that it hasn't affected any of us
[39:16] here and none of us have ever had a
[39:19] problem with with this tongue that is
[39:22] mentioned in chapter 3 um it is
[39:25] something that is just so evolent in the
[39:28] world today I was I was up praying the
[39:31] other day was praying about uh the word
[39:36] and and Lord what do you want me to
[39:37] bring bring forth and as I was up in the
[39:40] in the Catalina mountains where I go
[39:42] many times to try to get alone try to
[39:44] get quiet before the Lord way back up in
[39:47] there and I'm
[39:50] praying and it's just a beautiful day
[39:53] just the sun is just perfect everything
[39:57] the the temperature was about
[39:58] 60° it was just I was just so thankful
[40:02] just thanking the lord for what he's
[40:03] done done for us and as I was praying
[40:07] and asking the Lord uh some things I
[40:11] heard a kind of a
[40:13] rustle and uh it was there's a there's
[40:16] so I sit up on a rock there's a big open
[40:18] Rock and there's a a canyon below me and
[40:22] then on the other side of the canyon it
[40:24] goes all the way up to uh to M Mount
[40:26] Lemon really and I I just love to just
[40:29] sit there and just look at the mountain
[40:31] and that Canyon below me started hearing
[40:34] some rustling going on down there and
[40:36] and I thought what is that it's just a
[40:39] just a faint noise so I got up and and I
[40:42] uh tried to kind of follow I'd sit there
[40:45] and I'd listen listen listen listen and
[40:48] then I'd hear another little rustle and
[40:50] and finally I I made my way along the
[40:53] cliff to
[40:56] overlook this area and it was a herd of
[40:59] Havalina and if you've ever seen a
[41:02] Havalina they are without a doubt the
[41:04] ugliest animal in the entire desert but
[41:08] this mama Havalina she had a baby with
[41:12] her and that thing was about this big
[41:15] and it was in between her her feet and
[41:19] even an ugly Havalina baby is so cute
[41:23] and I was looking down at that thing
[41:25] thinking man that is a that thing is
[41:27] really really cute but Mama is just so
[41:29] ugly and I I was I was watching those
[41:33] and just enjoying it and they they were
[41:36] kind of moving around and and i' just
[41:38] I'd hear them woof a little bit here and
[41:41] there and uh just enjoying it and and I
[41:45] heard somebody told me and I've tried
[41:46] this many times and I got the same
[41:48] result as every other time I've tried it
[41:50] I heard that if you woof like a
[41:54] havina that they'll come up closer to
[41:56] you
[41:57] so I uh gave my best woof
[42:01] woof and I must have said something
[42:03] offensive and Havish they they all took
[42:06] off running and uh and and they you know
[42:10] they made a little bit more ra more
[42:12] Ruckus and and then they were gone so I
[42:15] went back I made one my way back through
[42:17] the Rocks back to my place of prayer and
[42:20] I started praying
[42:22] again and uh soon after I started
[42:26] hearing
[42:28] voices and crunching
[42:32] walking and it gradually became louder
[42:36] and louder and I actually heard as there
[42:39] was an Australian accent from a woman's
[42:42] voice and and they get louder and louder
[42:45] and louder and they're still way way out
[42:47] there and and then they come around and
[42:49] and there's a trail that goes up at the
[42:51] base of the mountain and and they came
[42:54] into sight and I could see it was three
[42:55] women and and they were going along and
[42:58] and the one was talking about her
[43:00] mother-in-law and and with an a she had
[43:04] an Australian accent and the other one
[43:06] was talking about something else and and
[43:09] they they kept walking along and pretty
[43:11] soon I could hear there they were a
[43:13] couple hundred yards away but I could
[43:14] hear their conversation just as plain as
[43:16] as they and they're walking and and they
[43:19] and they um they eventually go across
[43:22] the mountains and and they're
[43:24] gone and I compared these women to these
[43:29] Havalina and and I thought a human
[43:34] being makes so much
[43:37] noise I could hear them coming a long
[43:40] way out and if if they weren't talking
[43:42] it would be the Stomping but those
[43:43] Havalina they were just right below me
[43:45] and I could just barely hear them and it
[43:49] was just thinking how
[43:51] nature and how James we we read
[43:55] earlier uh in a previous lesson on James
[43:58] James said be quick to hear and slow to
[44:03] speak and slow to wrath and these
[44:06] Havalina as I was up on the up on the
[44:08] hill watching down they would they would
[44:10] walk and and they'd eat around and they
[44:13] were always
[44:14] listening always listening for a
[44:16] predator or always listening for their
[44:19] babies or always listening for another
[44:22] of their group to make sure they were
[44:25] together and seeing how even
[44:29] nature it displays God's word that these
[44:33] Havalina they were quick to hear but
[44:36] they were slow to speak very quiet if
[44:39] they would have been like like us I mean
[44:43] they would just be quick Qui a quick
[44:46] meal for a mountain lion or for a bear
[44:49] or or or for a coyoty but instead
[44:52] they're quiet and they can get right up
[44:54] on top of you and you never know that
[44:56] they're there and then they're also
[44:58] there slow to wrath you know you hear
[45:00] stories about Havalina but they didn't
[45:02] turn and come fight me when I said
[45:04] whatever I said offensive to them they
[45:06] they just went they just took off and
[45:08] went their way thinking
[45:13] how
[45:15] nature it reflects on God's word when I
[45:18] would when I would take our kids out we'
[45:21] spend a lot of time out in the woods
[45:22] when they were young and I'd always tell
[45:25] them just listen listen just stop don't
[45:29] talk and let's have some quiet time
[45:31] let's get out in the woods or wherever
[45:33] we were and just listen and you will
[45:35] hear things that You' never knew were
[45:36] even there you'll hear birds and you'll
[45:39] hear squirrels and you'll hear the wind
[45:41] blowing through the pine trees and
[45:43] you'll hear a pine cone fall or or
[45:46] you'll hear the the leaves
[45:48] rattling we need to
[45:51] listen and we also need to be careful in
[45:57] our words and that's how this third
[46:00] chapter of James is he is telling
[46:03] us watch what you say remember James is
[46:06] a pastor of a church he was the half
[46:10] brother of the Lord Jesus he was the
[46:13] pastor of the the first and the biggest
[46:16] Christian church right there in
[46:18] Jerusalem so he knew all of the problems
[46:21] and it wasn't his in his epistle it
[46:23] wasn't meant to introduce him to the
[46:26] Lord Jesus they're like us they've
[46:28] already been introduced to the Lord they
[46:30] just needed correction they needed to
[46:33] grow in the Lord and that's what James
[46:34] is doing here and he's showing them that
[46:38] hey our words that we say they have
[46:42] power and they're very very important
[46:46] they um we think of the Gospel of John
[46:51] and he starts his gospel with in the
[46:54] beginning was the word
[46:58] and the Word was with God and the Word
[47:01] was God saying that if we are made in
[47:04] the image of God if God is his word then
[47:08] are we our words if we're made in him
[47:11] his image do our words Define us as
[47:15] God's word defines him I believe it's in
[47:21] 114 he says and the
[47:24] Word was made flesh it became real and
[47:29] it dwelt among us and if we're made in
[47:32] the image of God we are what we say we
[47:35] are our
[47:37] words we're constantly talking about
[47:41] about the power of the word and and you
[47:44] say oh just believe the word brother
[47:46] just just listen to the word sister just
[47:49] just just take the word as it is but we
[47:52] have to remember that this word it has
[47:56] such power power but it has power coming
[47:58] out of our mouths
[48:00] also our words are powerful the Bible
[48:04] says in Hebrews it says the word of God
[48:07] is quick and it's
[48:10] powerful and it's sharper than any
[48:12] two-edged sword that's the word of God
[48:15] but the words of mankind are also a
[48:18] sword and they can be used in defense or
[48:22] they can be used to
[48:24] attack and there they very very powerful
[48:28] no matter no matter how you see it and
[48:33] especially in today's world and we'll
[48:34] get to this everyone everyone in this
[48:37] building has great power in their words
[48:41] you have power to do great damage and
[48:44] you have power to do great good every
[48:47] person I'm talking about man woman and
[48:51] child I want to read a few quotes to you
[48:55] from different people
[48:57] um this uh a woman named Shannon Alder
[49:00] she read she she said this a coward
[49:03] talks to everyone but
[49:07] you Frank a Clark says gossip needing to
[49:10] be false to be evil there's a lot of
[49:13] truth that shouldn't be passed
[49:16] around Earl Wilson says gossip is when
[49:19] you hear something you like about
[49:22] someone you
[49:25] don't Joel Olstein says if you can't if
[49:28] you can't be positive then at least be
[49:32] quiet a Spanish proverb said whoever
[49:35] gossips to you will gossip about
[49:39] you Eleanor Roosevelt said great minds
[49:43] discuss
[49:44] ideas average Minds discuss
[49:48] events and small minds discuss
[49:53] people Leonard Ravenhill says notice we
[49:56] never pray for folks we gossip
[49:59] about and we never gossip about the folk
[50:02] for whom we pray for prayer is a great
[50:06] deterrent
[50:08] amen what the same man wrote this what
[50:12] good does it do to speak in tongues on
[50:14] Sunday if you have been using your
[50:17] tongue during the week to curse and to
[50:21] gossip Thomas Watson says
[50:23] this God has given us two years
[50:27] but one tongue to show that we should be
[50:30] swift to hear but slow to speak God has
[50:34] set a double fence before the tongue
[50:38] teeth and lips to teach us to be wary
[50:42] that we offend not with our tongue so
[50:45] your tongue just if you keep your mouth
[50:48] closed you got a double Fortress there
[50:50] between your teeth and your lips Joseph
[50:54] Hall says this there would not be so
[50:56] many many open mouths if there were not
[50:59] so many open
[51:02] ears Charles Spurgeon says if there were
[51:06] no gratified hearers of ill reports
[51:10] there would be an end of the trade of
[51:12] spreading them Charles Spurgeon also
[51:15] said this the best way to deal with
[51:17] slander is to pray about it God will
[51:21] either remove it or remove the Sting
[51:24] from it our own attempt at clearing
[51:27] ourselves are usually failures we are
[51:30] like the boy who wished to remove the
[51:32] blot from his copy and by his bungling
[51:36] made it 10 times worse you know I I
[51:38] related with what Charles Spurgeon says
[51:40] there is when I was a kid little kid in
[51:43] in in kindergarten we'd color you know
[51:46] they'd give you the sheets of of paper
[51:48] and You' get your crayons and you color
[51:50] and man I could not stay in the lines
[51:53] and I don't know if I would just
[51:54] couldn't focus or I was looking around
[51:56] but but I always you know i' I'd be
[51:59] coloring and then right outside the line
[52:01] and I think oh man I messed up right
[52:04] there so what I would do is I would make
[52:06] a
[52:08] big blot where I where I got out of the
[52:12] lines and so it' be a rabbit or whatever
[52:15] it was and this rabbit would have this
[52:16] big thing coming out the side of his
[52:18] head and my teacher would always say why
[52:20] do you do that and I'd say oh well I got
[52:22] out of the lines right there and she'd
[52:23] say don't do that just try to stay in
[52:25] lines if you get out just just leave it
[52:27] there Martin Luther said you are not
[52:31] only responsible for what you
[52:34] say but also for what you don't
[52:37] say Frederick Robertson said you may
[52:40] tame the wild beast which we were going
[52:42] to get through talk about this in the
[52:44] Book of James you may tame the wild
[52:46] beast the conf flager of the forest will
[52:50] cease when all the Timber and the dry
[52:52] wood are consumed but you cannot arrest
[52:55] the progress of that cruel word which
[52:58] you uttered carelessly yesterday or this
[53:03] morning Martin Van B says if your foot
[53:06] slips you may recover your balance but
[53:09] if your tongue slips you cannot recall
[53:12] your
[53:14] words Theodore I have a few more
[53:16] Theodore EP says perhaps we have been
[53:18] guilty of speaking against someone and
[53:20] have not realized how it may have hurt
[53:23] them then when someone speaks against us
[53:27] we suddenly realize how deeply such
[53:29] words hurt and we become sensitive to
[53:31] what we have done I wish that was the
[53:34] case but unfortunately that's usually
[53:36] not the
[53:39] case AB Simpson says I would rather play
[53:41] with a with forked lightning or take in
[53:44] my hand living wires with their fiery
[53:47] current than to speak speak a reckless
[53:49] word against any servant of Christ or
[53:53] idly repeat the slanderous darts which
[53:56] thousands of Christians are hurling on
[53:58] one
[54:00] another Richard Richard Cecil says this
[54:03] if any person to whom you feel dislike
[54:07] if there is any person to whom you feel
[54:08] dislike that is the person of whom you
[54:11] ought to never
[54:13] speak brother brandom says if you you
[54:16] don't have to stick a knife into a man's
[54:18] back to kill
[54:19] him you can break his character and kill
[54:22] him you can kill his
[54:25] influence brother R also said this
[54:28] adultery is the perversion of a legal
[54:32] act a lie is a perversion of the
[54:37] truth John Calvin said it is a sign of a
[54:40] perverse and treacherous disposition to
[54:43] wound the good name of another when he
[54:46] has no opportunity of defending
[54:49] himself it's more true today I believe
[54:52] in it's ever
[54:54] been John Calvin also said this I
[54:56] consider the looseness with words I
[54:59] consider looseness with words no less of
[55:01] a defect than looseness of the
[55:09] bowels another person also said that the
[55:11] Apostle
[55:12] Paul fir 2 Timothy 3:1 says
[55:16] this this also know no this know also
[55:21] that in the last
[55:22] days perilous time shall come for men
[55:26] shall be lovers of their own selves
[55:27] Covetous bla boasters proud blasphemers
[55:32] disobedient to parents unthankful and
[55:35] Unholy without natural affection truth
[55:38] Breakers false
[55:40] accusers
[55:42] incontinent the quote from Calvin that I
[55:45] just read incontinent
[55:48] Fierce despisers of those that are a
[55:50] good that word false accusers we think
[55:53] about a lie but it doesn't have to be a
[55:56] Li to qualify as a false accuser you
[55:59] know there's been a real push over the
[56:02] past I don't know 10 20 years to attack
[56:05] some of the founding fathers of our
[56:07] country Thomas Jefferson is one of them
[56:11] Thomas Jefferson they've they've said
[56:13] really horrible things about him saying
[56:16] that he was a slave owner and and and
[56:19] accusing him of having Affairs an affair
[56:22] with with one of his slaves and and many
[56:25] many things
[56:27] accusing this man Thomas Jefferson of
[56:30] and Thomas Jefferson isn't here to
[56:33] defend himself but yet they accuse him
[56:38] of owning
[56:40] slaves every wealthy person back then
[56:44] owned
[56:45] slaves but we try to bring Thomas
[56:47] Jefferson into
[56:50] today and attack him for living in a
[56:55] different age and try to bring him to
[56:57] this age of course if Thomas Jefferson
[56:59] lived in this age he wouldn't be for
[57:02] slavery he wouldn't be for racism he
[57:04] wouldn't be for any of that Thomas
[57:06] Jefferson is the one who wrote the
[57:10] Declaration of Independence and said in
[57:13] the Declaration of Independence all men
[57:16] are created
[57:19] equal and yet we try to pull this man
[57:22] out of history and attack his character
[57:25] really because he lived in a different
[57:29] age and yet he was one of the greatest
[57:32] men but we try to erase history we try
[57:35] to change history and make these people
[57:38] different than they are these this is
[57:40] called a false
[57:43] accusation there's false
[57:45] accusers I mentioned incontinent before
[57:48] that means that word incontinent is
[57:49] without
[57:51] self-control Inc continent is people
[57:54] that today it's people that can't
[57:55] control their bladder or can't control
[57:56] their ba bowels and like the Apostle
[57:59] Paul Calvin says that he considers
[58:01] looseness with words no less of a defect
[58:04] than looseness of the
[58:07] bowels when an opportunity arises to say
[58:10] a negative
[58:11] word and you can't control yourself you
[58:15] think of that
[58:17] incontinence and when you spew out these
[58:19] words there's no cleaning up the mess in
[58:22] this situation your words are already
[58:24] out and you have already already done
[58:26] the damage to both the person that
[58:28] you're talking about and also to your
[58:31] own self you damage your own
[58:34] reputation what I said about earlier the
[58:37] person that's that is gossiping to you
[58:39] is probably gossiping about you we
[58:41] really we understand that subconsciously
[58:44] knowing that this person who's always
[58:46] spreading all of these these rumors and
[58:49] all all of this news this person is
[58:51] probably going to do it about
[58:53] me and when you lose Lo people's faith
[58:57] when you lose people's confidence you
[58:59] develop a reputation for yourself and
[59:01] then the only thing that they're going
[59:02] to share with you is perhaps more
[59:05] gossip and then it goes into this
[59:08] vicious cycle and our
[59:11] words are so they're so important I need
[59:15] some help I want to I want to do a uh I
[59:17] want to do a demonstration Zeke come up

[1:01:44] Zeke 2 Corinthians 12 verse 20 I'm going
[1:01:49] to read the English Standard Version of
[1:01:51] this if you can put up the King James
[1:01:53] Version 2 Corinthians 12
[1:01:57] 20 for I
[1:01:59] fear this is the Apostle Paul addressing
[1:02:03] the people at Corinth the Church of
[1:02:04] Corinth and he says this for I fear that
[1:02:06] perhaps when I come I may find you not
[1:02:10] as I wish and that you may find me not
[1:02:14] as you
[1:02:15] wish that perhaps there may be
[1:02:17] quarreling and jealousy and anger and
[1:02:19] hostility and slander and gossip and
[1:02:22] conceit and
[1:02:24] disorder I fear that when I come again
[1:02:28] my my God May humble me before you and
[1:02:31] that I may have to mourn over many of
[1:02:33] those who sinned earlier and have not
[1:02:35] repented of impurity and sexual
[1:02:37] immorality and sens and sensuality that
[1:02:40] they have practiced so Paul is saying
[1:02:42] that that when I come back to you to the
[1:02:45] church he said I'm afraid that I'm going
[1:02:48] to find this toothpaste out of the
[1:02:52] tube he says I'm afraid that I'm going
[1:02:54] to find quarrel in and jealousy and
[1:02:58] slander and gossip and he says when I
[1:03:01] come he says I'm afraid that I fear that
[1:03:05] I'm going to find things not as I want
[1:03:07] them to and when I come and I see this
[1:03:10] you're going to
[1:03:12] find that you're not going to appreciate
[1:03:16] me either because I'm going to set these
[1:03:18] things
[1:03:23] straight he comes and he the Apostle
[1:03:26] Paul's warning them listen when I come
[1:03:29] when I get
[1:03:31] there you you need to have these things
[1:03:34] straight I taught you taught you not to
[1:03:36] be talking about each other I taught you
[1:03:38] not to be fighting with each other but
[1:03:40] then you go and do it when Jesus Christ
[1:03:45] returns as Paul was returning to this
[1:03:48] Corinthian Church when Jesus Christ
[1:03:51] returns is he going to find toothpaste
[1:03:54] all over the place
[1:03:56] is he going to find all of the problems
[1:03:59] is he going to find all of the slander
[1:04:01] is he going to find all of the talking
[1:04:02] about each other is he going to find all
[1:04:04] of the
[1:04:07] fighting is he going to find all of this
[1:04:10] is he going to find all of our
[1:04:11] differences right out there for everyone
[1:04:13] to
[1:04:14] see and I ask our differen is really
[1:04:17] that important that we would separate
[1:04:20] those who
[1:04:21] claim the name of Jesus Christ and we
[1:04:23] would separate ourselves from them
[1:04:26] think about your doctrines think about
[1:04:28] our doctrines baptism and dress and
[1:04:30] music and Bible translations and
[1:04:33] denominations and churches and pastors
[1:04:35] and Prophets and Unwritten
[1:04:37] rules are they enough to separate
[1:04:41] us when Jesus Christ
[1:04:44] returns are we going to say Lord I
[1:04:48] separated from those people that claim
[1:04:53] you there's a
[1:04:56] brother told me one
[1:04:58] time I was ministering on Unity I was
[1:05:02] ministering on this type of thing which
[1:05:03] is one of my common subjects that I
[1:05:05] Minister on and he says he says well
[1:05:07] brother Daniel he says what separates us
[1:05:09] from the Baptist church across the
[1:05:12] street my answer is what why do you want
[1:05:14] to be
[1:05:16] separated is there something that is
[1:05:19] more important to you to divide yourself
[1:05:24] from another Christian
[1:05:27] that when Jesus returns you are going to
[1:05:30] say I'm not part of
[1:05:33] them John Chapter 13 Jesus said a new
[1:05:36] commandment I give you that you love one
[1:05:38] another as I have loved you and that you
[1:05:40] also love one another by this shall all
[1:05:43] men know that you are my disciples if
[1:05:45] you have loved one for another he didn't
[1:05:47] say by this I will know you he said that
[1:05:49] a different time but he says by by this
[1:05:51] all other men will know that you're my
[1:05:54] disciples because because of your love
[1:05:57] one for
[1:05:59] another he didn't say your gossip he
[1:06:02] didn't say your doctrines he didn't say
[1:06:04] your church he didn't say those things
[1:06:06] he said that you should love one another
[1:06:09] and by this other
[1:06:11] people will know that you're a Christian
[1:06:15] other people will know that you are my
[1:06:19] disciple and our difference enough our
[1:06:22] our differen is enough to put down other
[1:06:25] Christian churches Baptist and Nazarene
[1:06:28] and the mega churches and whatever it is
[1:06:30] I was careful to put quotes from all
[1:06:33] kinds of different Christian pastors
[1:06:35] than what I just
[1:06:36] read whatever it
[1:06:40] is is it enough to say that they're not
[1:06:43] with us they're not part of us and there
[1:06:46] is there's a Baptist church across the
[1:06:48] street am I going to
[1:06:50] say no Jesus I'm not part of them
[1:06:56] because of
[1:06:58] what because of doctrines or am I going
[1:07:02] to say no I'm with them they believe in
[1:07:04] Jesus Christ and him crucified they
[1:07:07] believe in the holy spirit of God we may
[1:07:09] disagree on certain things but we are
[1:07:13] together in
[1:07:16] Christ and that's not even mentioning
[1:07:19] the Ridiculousness of of how we in our
[1:07:22] circles separate ourselves I don't want
[1:07:25] even go there there
[1:07:26] Ephesians
[1:07:28] 4 verse
[1:07:30] 29 says
[1:07:32] this let no corrupt communication
[1:07:34] proceed out of your
[1:07:36] mouth but that which is good to the use
[1:07:38] of edifying that it may Minister grace
[1:07:42] to the hearer edifying is building up so
[1:07:46] he says let nothing come out of your
[1:07:48] mouth that is not building
[1:07:51] up but how many times does things come
[1:07:54] out of our mouth in in the defense or or
[1:07:56] attacking others how many times do
[1:07:58] things things come out of our
[1:08:00] mouths that are tearing people
[1:08:03] down no matter if they deserve it or
[1:08:07] not he didn't say if they deserve it or
[1:08:11] not you can't put once we say it as I
[1:08:16] said you can't put the toothpaste back
[1:08:17] in the tube now look at this next verse
[1:08:21] that is a very strong warning and grieve
[1:08:23] not Ephesians 4:30 and grieve not the
[1:08:26] Holy Spirit whereby you are sealed until
[1:08:29] the day of your Redemption these things
[1:08:32] this talking and this fighting and he's
[1:08:35] saying these things they grieve
[1:08:37] away the holy spirit of God they drive
[1:08:40] him
[1:08:41] away let all bitterness and wrath and
[1:08:44] anger and clamor and evil speaking be
[1:08:46] put away from you with all malice too
[1:08:49] let it all be put away with away from
[1:08:52] you and be kind one to to another
[1:08:57] tenderhearted forgiving one another even
[1:09:01] as God for Christ's sake has forgiven
[1:09:06] you James 1:26 says if a man among you
[1:09:10] seem to be
[1:09:12] religious and bridleth not his tongue
[1:09:15] but deceiveth his own heart this man's
[1:09:18] religion is
[1:09:21] vain there's this kind of like the Hall
[1:09:24] of Shame sh is what I'm calling it this
[1:09:26] morning in Proverbs the seven things
[1:09:30] that God hates we're all familiar with
[1:09:34] this scripture Proverbs 6:1 16 these
[1:09:37] seven things that God hates and as I
[1:09:39] read them I want you to take note of how
[1:09:43] many things that God hates that relate
[1:09:46] to our tongue and what we
[1:09:49] say Proverbs
[1:09:51] 6:16 these six things that the Lord hate
[1:09:55] yay seven are an Abomination unto
[1:10:00] him an
[1:10:02] Abomination is Extreme
[1:10:06] disgust Now
[1:10:08] watch how many of these things have to
[1:10:10] do with our
[1:10:13] words verse 17 these thing these these
[1:10:17] six thing does the Lord hate y seven an
[1:10:19] abomination in him a proud
[1:10:22] look a lying tongue
[1:10:27] hands that shed innocent
[1:10:29] blood a heart that deviseth Wicked
[1:10:33] imaginations
[1:10:35] feet that be Swift in running to
[1:10:41] Mischief the ones who are always in the
[1:10:43] middle of a controversy is what this is
[1:10:45] talking about they run to the conflict
[1:10:47] because they want to put their opinion
[1:10:49] in disgusts God that's
[1:10:52] three a false witness that speaks lies
[1:10:57] four and he that SWS Discord among
[1:11:02] Brethren five of the seven things in
[1:11:05] this Hall of shame that God hates these
[1:11:08] are way up at the top the seven things
[1:11:10] that God hates seven they're an
[1:11:12] Abomination to him they make him sick
[1:11:15] they disgust him five of
[1:11:18] them are created with the
[1:11:21] tongue are
[1:11:23] fighting so the one scripture that we
[1:11:25] see that God hates the most piled all
[1:11:31] together all of
[1:11:33] them we can commit every
[1:11:37] day you ask yourself have you have you
[1:11:39] said a negative word about someone
[1:11:42] today and today Satan has made a way for
[1:11:45] our foolishness and our negative talking
[1:11:47] he's made a way for it to just go out
[1:11:51] even more than it ever has through
[1:11:53] social media
[1:11:55] now everybody wants everybody wants to
[1:11:57] have a say everybody wants to be an
[1:11:59] expert everybody wants to get their
[1:12:01] voice out and when they do
[1:12:04] so it just spreads the toothpaste just
[1:12:07] splatters it
[1:12:09] everywhere
[1:12:11] Jude I'm gonna get back to that when we
[1:12:13] get to James I gotta hurry um Jude the
[1:12:16] author of the The epistle Jude is
[1:12:19] probably the brother of James we're in
[1:12:22] James and the half another half brother
[1:12:24] of Jesus
[1:12:25] so this is another one that's feeling
[1:12:27] the same thing Jude Jude writes this um
[1:12:31] verse 8 the book of Jude I'll read the
[1:12:34] new King James
[1:12:35] version uh Jude 8 likewise also these
[1:12:39] dreamers defile the flesh reject
[1:12:42] Authority and speak evil of dignitaries
[1:12:45] Yet Michael the Archangel in contending
[1:12:48] with the devil when he disputed about
[1:12:50] the body of Moses dared not to bring
[1:12:52] against him a reviling accusation but
[1:12:55] said the Lord rebuke you so what's he
[1:12:57] talking about there so Moses we know
[1:13:00] that he died up on the mountain but we
[1:13:02] don't know what happened to his body we
[1:13:03] don't know where he was buried he didn't
[1:13:04] have a tomb and here is the Archangel
[1:13:07] Michael and he is disputing face to
[1:13:11] face with Satan with the
[1:13:14] devil and he didn't bring an accusation
[1:13:17] against the devil he didn't go talk
[1:13:19] behind his back he didn't go spread
[1:13:21] rumors about the
[1:13:23] devil he didn't even speak the the truth
[1:13:26] about the devil outside of what he said
[1:13:28] face to face and he said the Lord rebuke
[1:13:31] you for what you're
[1:13:33] saying now there was probably all this
[1:13:35] going on about where Moses was or if
[1:13:38] Moses raised from the dead or if he
[1:13:40] didn't and all of these these fightings
[1:13:42] that were going on all these doctrinal
[1:13:44] differences here we have Michael two
[1:13:45] angels Michael and Satan and they're
[1:13:48] fighting and even then the Archangel
[1:13:51] Michael against the most evil being that
[1:13:55] has ever been
[1:13:56] here even he didn't speak evil against
[1:14:01] evil incarnate or evil made real is is
[1:14:05] Satan but these speak evil talking about
[1:14:09] these other people talking about all of
[1:14:11] us really but these speak evil of
[1:14:13] whatever they do not
[1:14:16] know and whatever they know naturally
[1:14:19] like brute brute beasts in these things
[1:14:21] they corrupt themselves woe unto them
[1:14:26] for they have gone in the way of Cain
[1:14:28] and have run greedily in the air of
[1:14:30] balum for profit and perished in the
[1:14:34] rebellion of
[1:14:35] Kora it says right here they don't
[1:14:39] understand so they're speaking evil
[1:14:41] against it and by doing that they
[1:14:43] corrupt
[1:14:45] themselves they have gone the way of
[1:14:47] Cain and what did Cain do he murdered
[1:14:49] his
[1:14:51] brother what do we know that you can
[1:14:53] murder someone
[1:14:56] by speaking evil against them by
[1:14:57] spreading a rumor by by killing their
[1:14:59] influence and that's what Cain did he
[1:15:02] murdered him in the flesh but we can
[1:15:04] murder him in life destroy his
[1:15:10] reputation words our words Express the
[1:15:14] hatred that's inside of us James chapter
[1:15:19] 3 verse one
[1:15:25] James was a pastor remember my brethren
[1:15:28] be not many Masters knowing that we
[1:15:30] shall receive the greater
[1:15:34] condemnation the new King James says my
[1:15:36] brethren let not many of you become
[1:15:38] teachers knowing that we receive a
[1:15:41] stricter judgment why is that why does a
[1:15:45] pastor or a minister why does he receive
[1:15:48] a stricter judgment why does he need to
[1:15:51] be more careful with his words rather
[1:15:54] than the the the
[1:15:57] L it's because his words carry more more
[1:16:01] weight I'm speaking to 150 people or so
[1:16:04] right
[1:16:05] now and that's it it's holding weight
[1:16:09] and that's more weight than oneon-one
[1:16:10] both are still very very important but
[1:16:14] today through social media through
[1:16:17] Facebook and Instagram and YouTube
[1:16:20] YouTube videos we can go out and we can
[1:16:24] attack
[1:16:26] someone get our words out there and now
[1:16:30] we are more responsible because we have
[1:16:33] a bigger audience that's any of us have
[1:16:37] to be so careful in what we say James
[1:16:40] right here is saying that you're more
[1:16:42] responsible you pastors and every Pastor
[1:16:45] really should read James
[1:16:47] 3:1 everyone that wants to be a minister
[1:16:50] listen you're going to be judged
[1:16:52] higher than than anyone
[1:16:55] else because of your ministry and now we
[1:16:59] see the voice of the people is rising up
[1:17:03] and if if you are an influencer you are
[1:17:06] going to be judged higher too because
[1:17:08] you are influencing more people a pastor
[1:17:10] is an influencer a minister is an
[1:17:13] influencer just like all of these people
[1:17:15] that you see on YouTube they're trying
[1:17:17] to get their point
[1:17:19] across for in many
[1:17:21] things verse number two for in many
[1:17:24] things we have
[1:17:25] all we stumble in many things we make
[1:17:30] mistakes if a man offend not in word if
[1:17:33] he doesn't stumble in his words the same
[1:17:35] as a perfect man and able also to Bridle
[1:17:38] the whole body so if you're able to hold
[1:17:40] your tongue especially if you're someone
[1:17:43] with influence whether that's a pastor
[1:17:46] or whoever it is then you are able to
[1:17:48] control every aspect of your life behold
[1:17:51] we put bits in the horse's mouths and
[1:17:54] they that they may obey us and we turn
[1:17:57] about their entire body when I was um
[1:18:00] when I was younger we always had horses
[1:18:02] and I rode a lot and many times I would
[1:18:05] just throw a halter on the horse and get
[1:18:08] out and and and ride the horse around
[1:18:10] but when it was important when I had to
[1:18:12] have control over the horse I put a bit
[1:18:14] in its mouth and that bit made it to
[1:18:18] where that horse had to obey me because
[1:18:21] that bit when you turn them to the left
[1:18:23] or to the right if they go against you
[1:18:25] it will press on their gums and it will
[1:18:27] force them to go and that's how it is
[1:18:31] with with our tongue is what he's saying
[1:18:33] is if if you can just Bridle that tongue
[1:18:37] then you can move the whole
[1:18:39] body behold also the
[1:18:42] ships which though they be great and are
[1:18:44] driven with Fierce winds yet they are
[1:18:47] turned about with a very small
[1:18:49] Helm whatsoever the governor listen so
[1:18:52] whoever's driving the boat
[1:18:55] he can take this giant ship and then
[1:18:57] there's one Rudder that's tied into that
[1:19:00] steering wheel and as he turns it
[1:19:03] doesn't matter if it's a giant barge out
[1:19:05] in the open out in the ocean that barge
[1:19:08] is going to turn whichever way that
[1:19:09] Captain
[1:19:11] says and it's the same with our
[1:19:14] tongue the Apostle the um the pastor
[1:19:17] here is saying that that the ships are
[1:19:20] are controlled even though they go
[1:19:22] through the fierce winds and yet they
[1:19:24] are turned about with a very small Helm
[1:19:26] whatsoever the the governor listeth even
[1:19:28] so the tongue is a little member and
[1:19:31] boasts great things behold how great a
[1:19:34] matter a little fire
[1:19:38] kindleth New King James says how great a
[1:19:41] forest a l little fire Kindles so we
[1:19:46] many times in in the summer and in the
[1:19:49] fall you'll have these forest fires and
[1:19:52] they start from just one little fire
[1:19:55] somebody somebody Kindles a little a
[1:19:57] little campfire or something the wind
[1:20:00] blows and as that wind blows on that
[1:20:03] fire it spreads the The Embers around
[1:20:07] those Embers those Embers go from from
[1:20:10] grass to grass and and they start they
[1:20:13] start going down and as the wind blows
[1:20:16] it starts to to build those little fires
[1:20:19] all from this little campfire that was
[1:20:22] going the wind blows on it and it
[1:20:25] spreads all over and you can have a
[1:20:26] forest fire that Co that covers tens of
[1:20:28] thousands of Acres just from one little
[1:20:31] thing and James is saying this is how
[1:20:33] your words
[1:20:34] are one little bit of
[1:20:38] words and it can do so much damage you
[1:20:40] can burn down the whole
[1:20:43] forest and the tongue is a
[1:20:46] fire a world of
[1:20:49] iniquity so is the tongue among our
[1:20:51] members that it defileth the whole body
[1:20:55] and Seth on fire the course of Nature
[1:20:58] and it is set on on fire of Hell another
[1:21:02] translation says and it is set on fire
[1:21:05] by
[1:21:07] hell these words that we
[1:21:11] say this gossip that we propagate that
[1:21:15] we
[1:21:16] repeat James is saying that it's coming
[1:21:19] from the very pits of hell and it's
[1:21:22] coming up and and it's going into to you
[1:21:25] and it's coming out your
[1:21:27] mouth and it's
[1:21:31] destroying said how powerful the spoken
[1:21:35] word is amen and how powerful are the
[1:21:38] words of mankind we do we have the power
[1:21:41] to
[1:21:42] destroy and many have been are being
[1:21:46] destroyed by the words of mankind
[1:21:50] especially today and it's never been
[1:21:51] like today before it it could go a
[1:21:53] little bit but a little bit out now Boom
[1:21:57] YouTube video boom it's
[1:22:00] out and on a small scale gossip in the
[1:22:03] church and once it gets started once
[1:22:06] that fire starts burning you can't put
[1:22:08] it out and it can go with somebody their
[1:22:11] entire life you can go and you can
[1:22:14] apologize to them but the toothpaste is
[1:22:18] out of the tube you can't put it
[1:22:21] back and once it's out you may want to
[1:22:25] try to make things right but you can't
[1:22:27] do it that person's reputation is
[1:22:29] tarnished because of
[1:22:32] words they are so
[1:22:36] harsh for every kind of Beast and of
[1:22:38] birds and of serpents and of things in
[1:22:41] the sea is
[1:22:42] tamed and hath been tamed of mankind I
[1:22:46] had a friend one time that um he was
[1:22:47] into falconry and he trained these Hawks
[1:22:51] and these Hawks would go out and they
[1:22:52] they'd hunt and they'd come back and and
[1:22:55] and he was their master and and they
[1:22:58] were they were with him they trusted him
[1:23:01] you've seen Dolphins I mean it talks
[1:23:03] about the the ones in the in the water
[1:23:05] you've seen Dolphins at SeaWorld or
[1:23:06] whatever you they go down and they jump
[1:23:09] and do flips and you know the the person
[1:23:10] will be standing on their nose and
[1:23:12] they'll be going around everything can
[1:23:15] be trained he's saying even a reptile
[1:23:18] can be
[1:23:19] trained Can Be
[1:23:22] Tamed but the tongue
[1:23:25] can no man
[1:23:26] tame it is an unruly evil full of deadly
[1:23:32] poison all of us have a
[1:23:35] tongue and all of us have that poison
[1:23:40] that James is talking about we all have
[1:23:41] the ability to do it every one of us
[1:23:45] therewith bless we God even the father
[1:23:49] and therewith curse we men so he's
[1:23:51] saying that that with your tongue you
[1:23:53] bless God and you praise God God and you
[1:23:54] and you sing God's glories and and
[1:23:56] you're here and you're singing with our
[1:23:58] worship team or or you're singing in
[1:24:00] your car and you're praising the Lord
[1:24:02] and that same tongue that you're
[1:24:04] praising therewith also we curse
[1:24:07] men which are made after the similitude
[1:24:10] of
[1:24:11] God so we speak evil evil maybe based on
[1:24:15] the truth against someone that is made
[1:24:17] in the image of
[1:24:19] God so when we say that are we saying No
[1:24:22] this person actually is not from God
[1:24:25] this person's from the devil when we
[1:24:27] talk about when we when we spread uh
[1:24:29] gossip about someone true or
[1:24:31] false are we saying that this person's
[1:24:33] not made in the image of God we're
[1:24:35] judging that
[1:24:36] person saying that they're they're
[1:24:38] they're from
[1:24:41] Satan or we saying maybe that we're not
[1:24:43] made in the image of
[1:24:48] God James is not
[1:24:51] saying that we are
[1:24:54] lying he's saying that we are cursing
[1:24:57] that person we are destroying his or her
[1:25:00] character either by starting news that
[1:25:02] you witness firsthand or by propagating
[1:25:06] hearsay these things that hurt a
[1:25:09] person's character brothers and sisters
[1:25:10] of I said as I said they
[1:25:13] murder and all of us as I'm talking I'm
[1:25:16] looking and I see everybody's eyes are
[1:25:19] very directly on me and I see that all
[1:25:22] of us have experienced this
[1:25:24] we've been hurt and I think that all of
[1:25:27] us have also been on the other side
[1:25:30] where we have said things that we should
[1:25:32] not have
[1:25:33] said out of the same mouth precedes
[1:25:36] blessing and cursing James says out of
[1:25:39] the same mouth precedes you're blessing
[1:25:43] God and and and your you're singing
[1:25:45] worship and out of that same mouth is
[1:25:48] coming out
[1:25:49] cursing he says my brethren these things
[1:25:52] ought not be so to
[1:25:56] be does a fountain send forth at the
[1:25:59] same place Sweet Water and
[1:26:03] Bitter Sweet Water and bitter so you
[1:26:06] have you have you have a a spring that's
[1:26:08] going out and you have a spring that
[1:26:10] that brings out salt water and it's not
[1:26:12] usable it's not drinkable this this this
[1:26:15] spring it can't give out both good water
[1:26:17] and bad water it doesn't give out good
[1:26:20] water in the morning and bad water in
[1:26:21] the evening salt water and and fresh
[1:26:24] water are infinitely
[1:26:26] mixable they will they they just are
[1:26:28] come together so you can't separate the
[1:26:30] two it's either good or it's bad and he
[1:26:34] goes on and he says the same thing about
[1:26:37] a a fig tree or a tree it's like you are
[1:26:40] what you are this this is a fig tree can
[1:26:42] a fig tree bring Olive berries no and
[1:26:46] neither can a grape vine bear
[1:26:49] figs you are what you
[1:26:52] are as I said at the beginning our words
[1:26:55] Define us just as God's words Define
[1:26:58] him so what are
[1:27:00] we I think that we should all of us take
[1:27:04] a time to examine oursel and
[1:27:07] repent think about think about the
[1:27:09] things that that we've said and I've
[1:27:14] I've
[1:27:14] seen in in the Book of James I think
[1:27:17] it's perfect we've seen these articles
[1:27:19] come out uh the newspaper articles I
[1:27:21] mentioned them a couple times
[1:27:26] about brother brandom and and then
[1:27:28] there's people that are being
[1:27:29] interviewed
[1:27:31] there that I
[1:27:34] know and what good would it be for me to
[1:27:38] come up and for me to attack that
[1:27:41] person's character with things that I
[1:27:44] know I would be falling into the same
[1:27:47] trap right here James says don't do
[1:27:50] that so if someone is saying something
[1:27:53] negative about you or about this person
[1:27:55] or about me or about this church or
[1:27:56] about someone that you you highly
[1:27:59] rever don't go and attack that
[1:28:04] person let the word of God
[1:28:07] Prevail you can rebuke that person face
[1:28:09] to face as Michael did with Satan but
[1:28:14] don't go and attack this person's
[1:28:16] character even if he has the lowest of
[1:28:18] all characters whoever the worst person
[1:28:20] in the world has never been as low as
[1:28:22] the one that Michael talked to in the
[1:28:24] book of
[1:28:25] Jude no one has ever been that low we
[1:28:29] should never justify ever no matter how
[1:28:31] bad that they have been never attacking
[1:28:34] a person's character even if those
[1:28:37] things that we say are
[1:28:39] true
[1:28:40] never and that is the hardest thing to
[1:28:46] do the
[1:28:48] same with pastors that have things in
[1:28:52] their past
[1:28:54] it's not it's not right for me to go and
[1:28:57] say you're going to this church or that
[1:28:59] denomination over there or this over
[1:29:01] here did you know about this pastor did
[1:29:03] you know what he has in his past no let
[1:29:07] the word come forth and you can say I
[1:29:09] disagree with this person on this on
[1:29:11] this basis but you don't bring this
[1:29:14] railing accusation against this
[1:29:17] person verse number 12 and I go through
[1:29:20] it quickly now can the Fig Tree my
[1:29:22] brethren bear Olive berries or even
[1:29:24] either of Vine figs so can no Fountain
[1:29:27] both yield salt and fresh
[1:29:32] water these things that are being
[1:29:38] said whether it be you see it on YouTube
[1:29:41] or whether whether it be in a newspaper
[1:29:43] or whether it be in a from a Pulpit or
[1:29:46] whatever if it is attacking someone and
[1:29:49] attacking their character they are not
[1:29:51] doing this according to the word of God
[1:29:54] they have to take James's gospel and
[1:29:57] they have to throw it out no matter if
[1:30:00] they are right in what they're
[1:30:03] saying they're
[1:30:05] wrong in doing it you can speak the
[1:30:11] truth and speak the truth wrongly now
[1:30:14] that doesn't mean don't help people if
[1:30:16] someone is stuck in a situation or if
[1:30:19] they're in a hostile Church environment
[1:30:20] or whatever it is you can help that that
[1:30:23] person by by no means are you supposed
[1:30:25] to stand back and just let that person
[1:30:27] suffer of course you you you help that
[1:30:30] person you may go to the Bible and say
[1:30:32] well here's where this is
[1:30:33] wrong but when you attack the
[1:30:36] character that is when you get outside
[1:30:40] of what the word says a defense attorney
[1:30:43] the first thing a defense attorney will
[1:30:47] do in defending their
[1:30:49] client is they will attack the
[1:30:54] accusers um attack their
[1:30:57] reputation the first thing they're going
[1:30:59] to do is they're going to attack that
[1:31:01] person's character and say now you can't
[1:31:03] believe this person that's accusing my
[1:31:06] client because they did this this this
[1:31:08] and this and this it's a good
[1:31:11] defense and it works but it's not right
[1:31:14] according to the Bible it's not right
[1:31:16] according to the Book of James it's not
[1:31:18] right according to to Paul's writings
[1:31:20] and it's it seems a bit
[1:31:22] uncomfortable you want want when
[1:31:24] somebody attacks something that you hold
[1:31:26] so dear you do not you can you can
[1:31:30] defend yourself but you do not go after
[1:31:33] that person's
[1:31:34] character I'll close with this my
[1:31:37] brother
[1:31:39] Jeremy um he played on uh the um UFA
[1:31:44] football team and it was the best team
[1:31:46] that UFA has ever had they won the
[1:31:48] Fiesta Bowl that year I think it was
[1:31:50] like in 1994 around there they won the
[1:31:53] Fiesta Bowl they were they were just
[1:31:55] they were one of the nation's best teams
[1:31:58] and they had this thing called the
[1:31:59] desert swarm defense you remember they
[1:32:03] were good there was many times that they
[1:32:07] would play another another team and the
[1:32:10] UFA the wild cats would have more yards
[1:32:13] on their defense than the other team had
[1:32:17] in their entire offense that for the and
[1:32:20] it was a good
[1:32:21] defense and that's how a Christian
[1:32:24] should be we don't go on the
[1:32:27] offense we don't attack but we have a
[1:32:30] very very good defense and this is our
[1:32:34] defense right here when somebody attacks
[1:32:36] you the musicians can come if if
[1:32:39] somebody attacks
[1:32:40] you then you can go right to this word
[1:32:44] and just take it you can defend yourself
[1:32:47] of course and say I didn't say that I
[1:32:49] didn't do that or I don't believe like
[1:32:52] that but as James says you don't go
[1:32:56] after you don't go on the
[1:33:00] offense verse number 12 says can a fig
[1:33:03] tree my brethren B Olive berries are
[1:33:05] either a Vine figs so can no Fountain
[1:33:08] both yield salt and
[1:33:12] fresh so if you are a fig tree you're
[1:33:17] GNA bear figs and if you're bearing
[1:33:19] olives there's something wrong you're
[1:33:22] not really a fig tree if you're out
[1:33:24] using the tongue and you're gossiping
[1:33:27] and you're spreading the the news about
[1:33:29] other people and it's in any way
[1:33:32] destructive even against your enemy
[1:33:35] you're not bearing
[1:33:36] figs you have a different
[1:33:39] nature you with
[1:33:41] me everybody's looking at me
[1:33:46] like brothers and
[1:33:48] sisters thank God thank God that we have
[1:33:51] the word god God is he is so so good to
[1:33:56] us and thank God that we can have this
[1:33:59] correction from from this man James he
[1:34:03] he wrote this as a pastor saying hey
[1:34:05] don't be talking about each other don't
[1:34:08] be running each other down and he goes
[1:34:11] back to I I wish I knew where he got the
[1:34:13] information but he said Michael didn't
[1:34:16] even bring a railing accusation against
[1:34:21] Satan I would love to know know where
[1:34:24] that came
[1:34:25] from it's the word of God so we know
[1:34:27] it's true but I'd love to hear that
[1:34:29] story we don't have the story but we
[1:34:32] have what was important about the story
[1:34:34] and that is you have no right no matter
[1:34:37] how evil that person or how much damage
[1:34:40] that person has done you have no right
[1:34:43] to attack that person with your tongue
[1:34:47] amen you with me God bless you brother
[1:34:50] Josiah
[1:34:53] [Music]
[1:35:00] where everything that I hold deep will
[1:35:04] lay before the
[1:35:07] holy
[1:35:09] consuming
[1:35:11] fire all my works and all my deeds and
[1:35:16] every prayer set on my knees will lay
[1:35:21] before the whole
[1:35:25] consuming
[1:35:27] fire all I want to
[1:35:30] see is
[1:35:35] Jesus all I want to
[1:35:39] see is him in
[1:35:43] me all I want to see is
[1:35:51] Jesus sh sh in through me let's sing
[1:35:57] verse one
[1:35:59] again oh I know the time is near where
[1:36:05] everything that I hold dear will lay
[1:36:09] before the holy
[1:36:13] consuming
[1:36:15] fire all my works and all my Deeds every
[1:36:21] prayer set on my knees will lay before
[1:36:25] the holy
[1:36:28] consuming
[1:36:31] fire all I want to
[1:36:34] see is
[1:36:39] Jesus all I want to
[1:36:42] see is him in
[1:36:46] me all I want to see is Jesus
[1:36:54] [Music]
[1:36:57] shineing through
[1:37:02] [Music]
[1:37:04] me brothers and sisters it's we come to
[1:37:08] church to receive
[1:37:11] correction and I got to tell you as I
[1:37:14] was ministering
[1:37:16] today I I feel that we did
[1:37:20] receive and and take what I said to
[1:37:22] heart take this book to Heart let's be
[1:37:26] careful what we say always use wisdom in
[1:37:30] your words because you cannot put your
[1:37:32] words back in your mouth once they're
[1:37:35] out there they are out there and they're
[1:37:39] just spread all over the place so let's
[1:37:43] be wise in our
[1:37:45] words use wisdom be quick to hear slow
[1:37:50] to
[1:37:50] speak slow to Wrath
[1:37:54] so I don't forget
