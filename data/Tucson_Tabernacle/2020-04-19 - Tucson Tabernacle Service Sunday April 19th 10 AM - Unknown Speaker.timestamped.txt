[48:50] the service to brother Matthew
[48:57] amen god bless you Saints I greet you in
[49:00] the name of the Lord this morning
[49:02] amen I trust that that you are an
[49:04] expectation for what the Lord has for us
[49:06] today and I appreciate all of the
[49:09] singing there from brother Matthew and
[49:11] the church amen and I appreciate your
[49:14] prayers for us here in Buford we're
[49:16] under a tornado watch right now so just
[49:18] continue to pray amen I'm glad I'm able
[49:21] to continue the service at a lot of my
[49:23] heart that I wanted to say to you today
[49:24] and just unburden myself so I just keep
[49:27] us in in remembrance today as we just
[49:30] have some severe weather but we just
[49:33] want to pour our hearts out to you this
[49:35] morning and unburden ourself from what
[49:37] the Lord has given us amen I know that
[49:39] you were there an expectation at home
[49:41] and you in church
[49:43] and so I just believe that we have the
[49:45] great Shepherd amongst us and he is the
[49:48] feeder of the Sheep Amen it's not man
[49:50] who feeds us amen but it's the Holy
[49:53] Spirit and he doesn't give us a natural
[49:55] food food but he gives us a spiritual
[49:57] food amen and I believe that's what our
[49:59] souls are longing for today is that
[50:01] spiritual appetite to be quenched amen
[50:05] so we just want to say God bless you and
[50:08] greet you in the name of the Lord and
[50:10] and and we're looking forward to the
[50:12] time when we can gather again all
[50:14] together today we'd like to just say
[50:17] that we'd like to dis minister to you
[50:19] this morning on something and I'm going

[50:41] gathered at church I'm here today in a
[50:44] building preached into a camera and and
[50:47] and no no life people here you know to
[50:50] to pull on the Word of God no music for
[50:53] an atmosphere live music but but you
[50:56] know let me just say this brother
[50:57] Branham said and brother Arne sent me
[50:59] this quote and it's meant so much to me
[51:01] since he sent it to me and brother
[51:03] Branham says the distance means nothing
[51:05] to God he said brother Branham said that
[51:08] some of the greatest miracle
[51:10] that ever took place in his ministry
[51:12] were over the phone on a telephone
[51:14] praying for somebody who was sick
[51:16] somebody who was in need and so so this
[51:19] morning we know that distance means
[51:21] nothing to God and God I believe God has
[51:24] given us grace in these kind of times I
[51:27] believe that he's I've I've witnessed
[51:29] that myself here preaching excuse me
[51:33] preaching and yet I feel like there's a
[51:37] crowd of people even though just here by
[51:40] myself I can feel the pull of the word I
[51:43] can feel the pull upon your hearts it's
[51:45] been incredible to me just how amazing
[51:48] it is we know that a building is not a
[51:50] church people as what make up a church
[51:53] so I'm thankful for the grace of God
[51:54] that he's given us I'd like to say that
[52:00] through this live streaming our services
[52:03] I'm gonna try to stay away from teaching
[52:05] as much as possible and just preach what
[52:08] the Lord's put upon my heart I know that
[52:10] I'm coming into homes and coming into
[52:12] living rooms and there's great
[52:13] distractions and homes and you know and
[52:16] it's easier to be distracted and try to
[52:17] keep the children so I just want to keep
[52:19] things direct I want to keep things
[52:22] simple I don't want to get into anything
[52:25] deep I just want to just give you what
[52:27] the Lord's put upon my heart I'm also
[52:29] gonna be careful about my time and just
[52:32] be real studious about that and not go
[52:34] over alone a long long time because we
[52:36] are in a virtual set up here and and our
[52:40] attention Kelly can only last so long so
[52:42] just more than anything just come hungry
[52:46] come with an expectation and I believe
[52:48] the Lord Jesus will say something to you
[52:50] amen so let's just go before him here
[52:54] this morning before we do let's turn to
[52:55] our scripture and then we'll pray first
[52:58] Peter chapter 2 if you have your Bible
[53:00] we'll have you turn this morning I'd
[53:02] also like to say that because of the
[53:04] severe weather we don't know what will
[53:06] happen I may lose power mate we may lose
[53:09] this stream I've already given a tape of
[53:11] the Prophet for the brothers to play if
[53:13] that was to happen and they just play a
[53:15] portion of that that would be
[53:17] appropriate so that's already we're just
[53:19] just saying that that just in case this
[53:21] goes down on my end don't
[53:23] turn it off that tape will be playing so
[53:25] first Peter chapter two I'd like to
[53:28] speak to you what the Lord just stirred
[53:30] upon my heart and would it begin to stir
[53:32] fresh to me again a message that I'm
[53:36] gonna title in the footsteps of Christ
[53:38] in the footsteps of Christ first Peter
[53:42] chapter 2 more just read some verses and
[53:44] we'll skip some of this wherefore laying
[53:47] aside all malice and all guile and all
[53:51] hypocrisy xand envies and all evil
[53:54] speakings as newborn babes desire the
[53:57] sincere milk of the word that you may
[53:59] grow thereby if so be you have tasted
[54:03] that the Lord is gracious to whom coming
[54:06] as unto a living stone disallowed indeed
[54:09] of men but chosen of God and precious
[54:11] you also as lively stones are built up a
[54:15] spiritual house a holy priesthood to
[54:18] offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
[54:21] to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it
[54:26] is contained in the scripture behold I
[54:28] lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone elect
[54:31] precious and he that believeth on him
[54:34] shall not be confounded glad for that
[54:38] unto you therefore which believe he is
[54:41] precious he says unto you therefore
[54:43] which believe he is precious but unto
[54:45] them which be disobedient the stone
[54:47] which the builders disallowed the same
[54:50] has made the head of the corner and a
[54:52] stone of stumbling and a rock of offense
[54:53] even to them which stumble at the word
[54:56] being disobedient wherein - also they
[54:59] were appointed but you are a chosen
[55:02] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[55:06] nation a peculiar people that you should
[55:10] show forth the praises of him who hath
[55:12] called you out of darkness into his
[55:15] marvelous light I'm so glad he's called
[55:18] me of chosen generation and called me
[55:21] out of Darkness let's move on down to
[55:23] verse 11 dearly dearly beloved I beseech
[55:27] you as strangers and pilgrims abstain
[55:29] from fleshly lusts which war against the
[55:32] soul having your conversation honest
[55:35] among the Gentiles that whereas
[55:37] they speak against you as evildoers that
[55:39] may be that they may by your good works
[55:43] which they shall behold glorify God in
[55:46] the day of visitation verse 15 for so if
[55:50] the will of God that with well doing you
[55:54] may put to silence the ignorance of
[55:56] foolish men as free and not using your
[55:59] liberty for a cloak of maliciousness but
[56:02] as the servants of God honor all men
[56:05] love the Brotherhood fear God honor the
[56:09] King Lord that's my desire I believe
[56:11] it's yours this morning verse 21 for
[56:14] even hereunto were you called because
[56:17] Christ also suffered for us leaving us
[56:21] an example notice this that you should
[56:24] follow his steps now that's my message
[56:28] to you today in the footsteps of Christ
[56:32] and I'm gonna get on this verse here
[56:34] let's read it one more time
[56:36] verse 21 for even hereunto you were you
[56:40] called because Christ also suffered for
[56:42] us leaving us an example that you should
[56:46] follow his steps who did no sin neither
[56:51] was guile found in his mouth who when he
[56:54] was reviled reviled not again when he
[56:56] suffered he threatened not but committed
[56:58] himself to him that judgeth righteously
[57:02] self bore our sins in his own body on
[57:06] that tree that we being dead to sins
[57:09] here's why should live unto
[57:12] righteousness by whose stripes you were
[57:14] healed for you were a sheep going astray
[57:17] but are now returning to the Shepherd
[57:20] and Bishop of our souls Lord Jesus were
[57:23] so thankful Lord are our heart just
[57:26] rejoices reading these words father that

[57:37] peace Lord the chastisement of our peace
[57:41] was laid upon you Father and by your
[57:43] stripes we are healed Lord your word

[57:57] sands of time

[58:18] expectation now may you meet it may you
[58:21] be the speaker Lord may you be the
[58:23] Shepherd as your word says the bishop
[58:26] and the Shepherd of our souls this
[58:27] morning we ask it Lord in Jesus Christ's
[58:30] name Amen amen you can be seated this
[58:34] morning those of you at church I want to
[58:36] read a quote just before we begin
[58:38] brother Branham says in the message
[58:40] forsaking all he says therefore you must
[58:43] forsake all to follow Christ you must
[58:46] forsake your own ideas you must cope
[58:49] with his word and never will you will
[58:52] the Holy Ghost even deny ever deny any
[58:55] word it ever spoke and the Bible is
[58:59] wrote by the Holy Spirit the Bible said
[59:01] the Bible is the Word of God in the
[59:03] beginning was the word the Word was with
[59:05] God the Word was God and the Word was
[59:07] made flesh and dwelt among us now the
[59:10] word is made spirit dwelling in us for I
[59:15] will be with you even in you to the end
[59:17] of the world the consummation now that
[59:20] same God that wrote the Bible is in you
[59:24] you're not your own you're dead to the
[59:27] things of the world you're dead to your
[59:30] own thoughts and the mind let the mind
[59:33] which was in Christ being you there then
[59:37] you're forsaking all to follow him not
[59:39] your own thoughts what he's not what you
[59:43] say but what he says he says not my will
[59:47] but thine be done Lord then you're
[59:49] beginning to line up with God's Word I'm
[59:52] preaching to you this morning on a
[59:54] thought the Lord gave me in the
[59:56] footsteps of Christ the Bible is filled
[1:00:00] with examples it's filled with the
[1:00:02] historical accounts
[1:00:04] of the lives and times of men and women
[1:00:07] you can read it all the way from the Old
[1:00:09] Testament going all through the stories
[1:00:12] of Israel all the way from the beginning
[1:00:14] with Adam and Eve
[1:00:15] all the way down through the act through
[1:00:17] the life and time of Jesus through the
[1:00:19] Acts of the Apostles and those that were
[1:00:22] in the first church all the way to the
[1:00:24] book of Revelation and what you'll find
[1:00:27] is is that both old and new were filled
[1:00:31] with the life lifes of men their choices
[1:00:35] that they made the word highlights their
[1:00:38] strengths and it also highlights their
[1:00:41] weaknesses it doesn't leave out the low
[1:00:44] parts but the Bible actually says there
[1:00:47] was a purpose that they all went through
[1:00:49] this we see the inspiration of the Bible
[1:00:51] is where our inspiration is comes from
[1:00:55] our inspiration to live a Christian life
[1:00:57] every single day comes from the
[1:01:00] inspiration of the word that we read in
[1:01:02] the word that we hear there a prophet in
[1:01:05] it is the consummation of all the lives
[1:01:08] of all men and all women down throughout
[1:01:11] history those that had good times and
[1:01:14] those that had bad times those that went
[1:01:17] through the flood and those that went
[1:01:18] through the fire and those that stood
[1:01:20] for Christ those fell away for Christ
[1:01:23] the Bible doesn't doesn't leave out the
[1:01:26] negative things but we see in the
[1:01:29] picture of the word we see a contrast we
[1:01:32] see types and shadows in the Old
[1:01:34] Testament that would point to a
[1:01:37] fulfillment in the New Testament the
[1:01:40] Bible says that that we see a law that
[1:01:43] in the Bible we find a law of contrast
[1:01:45] we see men who stood for for Jehovah we
[1:01:49] see men who fell away we we have every
[1:01:52] example that you could think of we have
[1:01:54] a table and a cane we have a we have a
[1:01:57] Seth and then we have a Nimrod we have a
[1:01:59] we have a Jacob and an E soul we have a
[1:02:02] Jesus and a Judas
[1:02:05] throughout the entire Bible there's
[1:02:07] always this law of contrast there's
[1:02:09] always this good and this bad and what
[1:02:12] we find is that this was an impression
[1:02:14] that was left for us this was a pathway
[1:02:17] the
[1:02:18] were footsteps that we could follow in
[1:02:20] the scripture actually says in 1st
[1:02:22] Corinthians chapter 10 verse 11 that
[1:02:26] that that we that there was a purpose
[1:02:28] for all of this there was a purpose that
[1:02:31] the Bible chose to record not only the
[1:02:34] successes of a man like David but it
[1:02:36] also in vivid detail gave us the
[1:02:39] mistakes of that same man it gave us the
[1:02:41] same failures of his son Solomon and it
[1:02:45] highlighted the the mistakes of a man
[1:02:47] like Jacob it also told us the good
[1:02:50] things in all of it we find an
[1:02:52] inspiration we find out we find a
[1:02:54] message we find a purpose and everything
[1:02:57] that God did 1st Corinthians chapter 10
[1:02:59] verse 11 says that there was a purpose
[1:03:02] that God actually orchestrated notice
[1:03:05] what it says here
[1:03:06] it says in verse 11 of first Corinthians
[1:03:09] 10 now all these things happen unto them
[1:03:13] for our examples for examples and they
[1:03:16] are written for our admonition so the
[1:03:20] word actually says something pretty
[1:03:22] profound here that it actually says that
[1:03:24] these people went through these things
[1:03:27] in their life now I'm not adding to
[1:03:28] scripture I'm only telling you exactly
[1:03:30] what it says it says all these things
[1:03:34] happened unto them for a purpose for
[1:03:37] example so God would literally take
[1:03:40] people through what we would call
[1:03:41] lowlights through mistakes through
[1:03:43] failures down pathways maybe that they
[1:03:46] couldn't understand we take men like Joe
[1:03:49] why did Jobe have to lose a family why
[1:03:51] did he have to lose his children why did
[1:03:53] he have to have boils and and the skin
[1:03:55] disease that he had it was all for an
[1:03:57] eternal purpose the Bible says that
[1:03:59] these things happen unto them for
[1:04:01] examples and it says they are written
[1:04:04] for our admonition for you for me and it
[1:04:08] says upon whom the ends of the world are
[1:04:11] come that's me friend that's you my
[1:04:14] brother my sister that these things were
[1:04:16] literally written for an example for a
[1:04:19] pathway for us to follow that says in
[1:04:22] another place it says that they were
[1:04:24] written for our examples that we should
[1:04:26] not lust as they lusted
[1:04:27] we should not complain and murmur as
[1:04:29] they complained and murmured
[1:04:31] the Bible says this word and the Greek
[1:04:34] and admonition it says they were written
[1:04:36] for our admonition that word admonition
[1:04:40] means a loving attempt to correct
[1:04:43] another's attitude or behavior so they
[1:04:46] were written as a loving attempt think
[1:04:50] about this that these stories in these
[1:04:53] examples that we could read were written
[1:04:55] as a loving attempt to correct our
[1:04:58] attitude and our behavior why did God
[1:05:01] put them in the Bible because they would
[1:05:03] be a message to you they would be a
[1:05:05] warning to you they would they could be
[1:05:07] an encouragement to you they could be
[1:05:09] something positive to you they could be
[1:05:11] speak as chastisement to you maybe they
[1:05:14] would they could speak to you it's your
[1:05:16] load times to give you joy when you're
[1:05:19] sad to give you correction when you need
[1:05:21] correction they were written as an
[1:05:24] example even the Old Testament the Bible
[1:05:27] says it's considered a treasure we have
[1:05:30] a modern church world today who wants to
[1:05:32] is almost ashamed of the story stories
[1:05:35] you read of the Old Testament they don't
[1:05:36] want to talk about the God who destroyed
[1:05:38] Sodom and Gomorrah because it doesn't
[1:05:40] fit in the modern scientific age of a
[1:05:43] loving God they're almost ashamed of the
[1:05:46] Old Testament stories but let me say
[1:05:48] this you can't have a revelation of the
[1:05:51] New Testament without a revelation of
[1:05:53] the Old Testament because brother
[1:05:55] Branham said that Jesus Jehovah of the
[1:05:58] Old Testament is Jesus of the New
[1:06:02] Testament
[1:06:02] I believe you can say amen to that
[1:06:05] Matthew chapter 13 verse 52 Jesus says
[1:06:09] that the old is like a treasure notice
[1:06:12] this in Matthew 13 verse 52 then he said
[1:06:15] unto them therefore every scribe which
[1:06:18] is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven
[1:06:20] is like unto a man that is a householder
[1:06:23] which bringeth the which bringeth forth
[1:06:25] out of his treasure things new and old
[1:06:30] so what is Jesus referring to here that
[1:06:33] the kingdom of heaven the mystery of God
[1:06:35] the revelation of Jesus Christ brother
[1:06:37] Branham would say it this way and I have
[1:06:39] this quote here in his love so much
[1:06:40] brother Branham says the entire
[1:06:43] your Bible this is out of Christ as
[1:06:44] revealed in his own word in 65 he says
[1:06:47] the entire Bible is the entire
[1:06:51] revelation of Jesus Christ making
[1:06:54] himself known to every age notice what
[1:06:57] he says there the entire Bible is the
[1:07:00] entire revelation of Jesus Christ not
[1:07:03] just Jesus of Nazareth it was more than
[1:07:07] just a man who walked in Galilee I'm
[1:07:08] glad for that I'm glad for that x-ray
[1:07:11] I'm glad I'm going on diminishing that
[1:07:14] here today but you can't take that and
[1:07:16] then leave out Jehovah it's the entire
[1:07:18] revelation because why my brother my
[1:07:21] sister it was to be a guide for our life
[1:07:24] it was to be a North Star to point us in
[1:07:27] the right direction God left this
[1:07:29] imprint both an amen in the old men in
[1:07:32] the new Christ Jesus himself it was to
[1:07:35] follow after his example to walk in his
[1:07:39] very footsteps and I want to walk in his
[1:07:41] footsteps in my life you see the Old
[1:07:44] Testament you can take up there you can
[1:07:46] take the types and the shadows and and
[1:07:49] if we're not careful we can we can
[1:07:51] almost become theologians and we could
[1:07:54] we can miss the entire point of what the
[1:07:56] law was given for we can miss the entire
[1:07:59] point of the stories of the Old
[1:08:00] Testament we can miss that they were a
[1:08:02] shadow they were pointing to an object
[1:08:05] they weren't they they stand alone by
[1:08:08] themselves but there was a reason why
[1:08:09] they were written you see the Old
[1:08:12] Testament you can take the old types the
[1:08:15] old shadows of the Old Testament and
[1:08:17] then you can you can you can you notice
[1:08:20] here remember Jesus says he says that's
[1:08:22] like a householder who takes from his
[1:08:24] treasure both old and new let me say it
[1:08:28] this way my friend the New Testament is
[1:08:31] in folded in the Old Testament catch
[1:08:36] that the New Testament is in folded or
[1:08:40] hidden between the lines in the Old
[1:08:43] Testament and and likewise the Old
[1:08:47] Testament is unfolded in the New
[1:08:50] Testament let me say that again in case
[1:08:52] you lost it the New Testament is in
[1:08:54] folded in the
[1:08:56] Old Testament and the Old Testament is
[1:08:58] unfolded in the New Testament you can't
[1:09:01] understand the Book of Leviticus unless
[1:09:03] you read the book of Hebrews you the
[1:09:06] book of Hebrews gives light the book of
[1:09:08] Hebrews gives light to what the Book of
[1:09:09] Leviticus is you can't understand the
[1:09:12] Book of Daniel chapter 11 specifically
[1:09:15] chapter 7 all the way through chapter 12
[1:09:17] you couldn't understand the Book of
[1:09:19] Daniel in the Old Testament without the
[1:09:22] book of Revelation it was the unfolding
[1:09:24] of what Daniel seemed you couldn't
[1:09:27] understand the Passover lamb
[1:09:28] you couldn't even understand Isaiah 53
[1:09:31] without their coming of Christ who would
[1:09:33] come to fulfill that scripture without
[1:09:36] the crucifixion you never understand the
[1:09:38] scapegoat you never understand the
[1:09:40] revelation of the Passover the value of
[1:09:44] the types is the anti-type not just the
[1:09:47] type but the fulfillment of that type
[1:09:50] they they they give us the inspiration
[1:09:52] of the scripture you could we could use
[1:09:56] this and and I could get lost here just
[1:09:58] for a moment and I want to be careful
[1:10:00] just to make sure that the point is
[1:10:02] clear but not to get too bogged down in
[1:10:04] it because that's not what we're
[1:10:05] preaching on today but the typology the
[1:10:08] shadows of the Old Testament it's the
[1:10:10] picture language in which the doctrines
[1:10:14] of the New Testament are understood all
[1:10:17] of it was a type and all of it was a
[1:10:19] shadow it was all I was all a sham an
[1:10:23] object and that object was not a law it
[1:10:26] was Christ Christ was the shadow of the
[1:10:29] Old Testament you notice here that that
[1:10:33] the the the as we said it's the picture
[1:10:36] language of the examples notice what he
[1:10:38] says here now all these things happened
[1:10:40] unto the unto them four examples so
[1:10:44] everything we read about was an example
[1:10:46] it was pointing to something it was
[1:10:48] written for our admonition which is our
[1:10:51] instruction upon whom the ends of the
[1:10:54] world or the end of the ages are come
[1:10:56] that's where we've come to my brother
[1:10:58] and my sister that's where you're at
[1:11:00] today we're at the end of the age Oh at
[1:11:03] the very end of all of the ages so the
[1:11:07] the Hebrews
[1:11:08] tells us that the shadows that they were
[1:11:11] shadows of good things to come and not
[1:11:13] the very image of the thing so it wasn't
[1:11:16] just written just for their life
[1:11:18] specifically but their life would play
[1:11:21] out a pattern it would speak to us in
[1:11:23] 2020 that's why we can glean from the
[1:11:26] life of Esther that's why it means
[1:11:28] something to us more than what it meant
[1:11:30] to any other age that's why the story of
[1:11:33] Isaac and Rebecca means more to you as
[1:11:35] the bride of Jesus Christ than it did
[1:11:37] for any other age than it did for even
[1:11:39] Isaac and Rebecca themselves these
[1:11:42] things happen to them for our examples
[1:11:45] glory he says Sarah he says here it's
[1:11:49] it's a shadow of good things to come but
[1:11:53] there was a good thing to come there was
[1:11:55] something real coming and we have that
[1:11:57] today you can look at this and we could
[1:12:00] use example after example I just want to
[1:12:02] use one here let me just find my place
[1:12:04] here and make sure that I don't I don't
[1:12:06] miss it
[1:12:08] I I could I could use many examples to
[1:12:11] to display this but I wanted to use the
[1:12:13] example of Christ let me let me let me
[1:12:17] show you these this word as and this
[1:12:19] word so it's very important because it's
[1:12:22] a structure you see here four types in
[1:12:24] the Bible it would always use the
[1:12:26] comparative words as and so the word as
[1:12:30] is used for the type and the word so is
[1:12:33] used for the anti-type the first is
[1:12:36] historic the second is prophetic let me
[1:12:38] give you some examples in 1st
[1:12:40] Corinthians 15 as in Adam as what does
[1:12:44] it mean historic it's a pre figure he
[1:12:48] says as it has an Adam all die even so
[1:12:52] prophetic in Christ shall all be made
[1:12:55] alive Matthew 24 Jesus says as the days
[1:12:59] of Noah were so shall also the coming of
[1:13:03] the Son of Man be as Moses lifted up the
[1:13:06] servant and the serpent in the
[1:13:07] wilderness even so must the Son of Man
[1:13:09] be lifted up as Jonah was three days and
[1:13:13] three nights in the whales belly so
[1:13:14] shall the Son of Man be three days and
[1:13:18] three nights in the heart of the earth
[1:13:19] so we see the
[1:13:21] as and the so it was a type you you all
[1:13:25] of the men of God you take Abraham
[1:13:27] Abraham was a type of God Isaac was a
[1:13:29] type of Christ look at this look at this
[1:13:31] example both Isaac I'm just gonna give
[1:13:35] you one both Isaac and Christ were a
[1:13:38] child of promise Genesis chapter 15
[1:13:41] verse 4 and behold the word of the Lord
[1:13:44] came unto him saying this shall not be
[1:13:46] thine heir but he that shall come forth
[1:13:49] out of thy own bowels shall be thine
[1:13:52] heir what does it say prophetically
[1:13:54] about Jesus in Isaiah chapter 7
[1:13:56] therefore the Lord himself shall give
[1:13:58] you a sign behold a virgin shall
[1:14:01] conceive and bear a son and shall call
[1:14:04] his name Emmanuel so Isaac was a child
[1:14:08] of promise Christ was a child of promise
[1:14:10] the birth of both of these men were pre
[1:14:14] announced in Genesis 1810 and he said I
[1:14:17] will certainly return unto the according
[1:14:19] to the time of life and lo Sarah thy
[1:14:22] wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it
[1:14:24] in the tent door which was behind him
[1:14:26] Luke chapter 1 verse 30 and the angel
[1:14:30] said unto her fear not Mary for thou has
[1:14:32] found favor with God and behold thou
[1:14:35] shalt conceive in thy womb and bring
[1:14:37] forth a son and shall call his name
[1:14:40] Jesus look at the type and the anti-type
[1:14:43] both Isaac and Jesus were named even
[1:14:47] before they were born in Genesis 17 and
[1:14:50] God said Sarah thy wife shall bear a son
[1:14:52] thou shalt call his name Isaac and Jesus
[1:14:55] in Luke chapter 1 verse 31 behold thou
[1:14:57] shalt conceive in that womb praying for
[1:14:59] the son and shall call his name Jesus so
[1:15:02] the birth of both of these notice this
[1:15:05] you'll see this here and it's it's very
[1:15:08] clear both are called and only son
[1:15:12] Genesis chapter 22 verse 2 and he said
[1:15:15] take missus God saying to Abraham take
[1:15:18] now thy son thine only son whom thou
[1:15:22] lovest and get the into the land of
[1:15:24] Moriah all for him there for a burnt
[1:15:26] offering notice what Hebrews chapter 11
[1:15:28] verse 17 says by faith Abraham when he
[1:15:31] was tried offer up to Isaac and
[1:15:34] he that and he says and he that had
[1:15:36] received the promises offered up his
[1:15:38] only begotten Son
[1:15:40] what is John 3:16 safe for God so loved
[1:15:43] the world that He gave His only begotten
[1:15:46] Son it was a type it was an anti-type to
[1:15:50] a type it was a prayer was a pathway it
[1:15:52] was leading to something it was it was
[1:15:55] pointing to something these things were
[1:15:57] for our examples Oh glory both were
[1:16:01] mocked and persecuted by their own
[1:16:03] kindred you think of Sarah when she was
[1:16:05] mocked and by Hagar and the Bible says
[1:16:07] cast out this bondwoman because it says
[1:16:09] when Sarah saw the Hagar the Egyptian
[1:16:11] mocking her notice exactly what Galatian
[1:16:15] says now we brethren as Isaac was are
[1:16:17] the children of promise but as then he
[1:16:20] that was born after the flesh persecuted
[1:16:22] him that was born after the spirit even
[1:16:24] so it is now notice this Isaac you can
[1:16:30] think of the most practical examples the
[1:16:33] Bible says that Isaac carried the wood
[1:16:35] upon which he was to be sacrificed
[1:16:38] Genesis 22 verse 6 and Abraham took the
[1:16:42] wood of the burnt offering and laid it
[1:16:44] upon Isaac his son and he took the fire
[1:16:47] in his hand and a knife and they went
[1:16:49] both of them together my brother my
[1:16:51] sister Abraham might not have
[1:16:54] husband but he was under the inspiration
[1:16:57] of the Almighty God to take that wood
[1:17:00] and lay it upon Isaac and make Isaac
[1:17:02] carry up the wood why because he was
[1:17:05] fulfilling an hour type of an anti-type
[1:17:08] coming that's why the Bible says in John
[1:17:10] 19 and he Jesus bearing his cross went
[1:17:15] forth into a place of the skull he
[1:17:17] carried his own course
[1:17:18] Isaac carried his own wood to his own
[1:17:20] sacrifice the Bible says Isaac went
[1:17:23] willingly Jesus went willingly it says
[1:17:26] here in Genesis 22 about Abraham and
[1:17:29] Isaac they came to a place which God had
[1:17:31] told him of and Abraham built an altar
[1:17:33] there laid the wood in the order bound
[1:17:35] his son Isaac and laid him upon the
[1:17:37] altar oh the Bible says that Jesus went
[1:17:41] willingly like a lamb to the slaughter
[1:17:43] the Bible says that both of them even
[1:17:46] Abraham and forsook his own son took the
[1:17:48] knife back to slay him and then the
[1:17:50] angel of God stops him and says now I
[1:17:52] know you love me Abraham seeing that
[1:17:55] they'll sacrifice the your only Son you
[1:17:57] say why would God ever do that why would
[1:17:59] God put Abraham through that because his
[1:18:01] life was going to be an example it was
[1:18:04] going to be written for a purpose it was
[1:18:06] going to have a fulfillment in Christ
[1:18:08] God does everything with the purpose he
[1:18:11] does nothing
[1:18:12] aimless nothing happens to you that's
[1:18:14] out of God's control nothing happens in
[1:18:17] the world that's out of God's order
[1:18:18] everything has a purpose we don't have
[1:18:21] time to go and bow and in these so much
[1:18:25] but we can just go type after type after
[1:18:27] type all of these things were written
[1:18:29] for an example every single bit of it
[1:18:33] the entire Bible it's constantly
[1:18:35] pointing us to what we should do and
[1:18:37] what we shouldn't do how we should live
[1:18:40] well how we shouldn't live now it's
[1:18:42] always an example of what to run to and
[1:18:45] what to flee from in the Word of God
[1:18:48] it's it's the very desire in all of us
[1:18:51] to live like Christ it's your desire
[1:18:54] it's my desire but where do we get that
[1:18:56] desire my brother my sister from an
[1:18:58] inspiration from the word because others
[1:19:01] have already walked down this pathway
[1:19:03] this pathway you're not owning it for
[1:19:05] the first time there's
[1:19:07] generations of people who've walked
[1:19:08] after the footsteps of Christ it's
[1:19:11] specific it's written in the hut to
[1:19:14] highlight the examples of error and
[1:19:16] truth the Bible is written to give
[1:19:18] instruction for learning just stay with
[1:19:20] me here I got something upon my heart
[1:19:21] but I just want to lay this foundation
[1:19:23] the Bible is written to give instruction
[1:19:26] for learning apprehension to that which
[1:19:28] we can apprehend Christ it's it's
[1:19:30] written in order you say brother Matt
[1:19:32] what's your greatest desire I believe my
[1:19:35] greatest desires the same desire as any
[1:19:37] believer I'm preaching to you today you
[1:19:39] could you could have your doctrine or
[1:19:41] you could have a perfect understanding
[1:19:42] you can have a perfect understanding of
[1:19:45] the mysteries have a perfect
[1:19:46] understanding even revelation of the
[1:19:48] Word of God but my brother what is the
[1:19:50] might what is what is it all to bring us
[1:19:52] to let us not lose sight of everything
[1:19:55] that was written let us not lose sight
[1:19:58] of everything that we understand no had
[1:20:00] no matter how great our doctrine is no
[1:20:02] matter how great our understanding is
[1:20:03] it's to bring us to one thing and that's
[1:20:06] to be like Jesus Christ
[1:20:09] oh I just want to preach to you today
[1:20:11] and I believe you're pulling on the Word
[1:20:13] of God from your home in a church
[1:20:15] there's nothing I desire greater than to
[1:20:18] be like Jesus than to walk in his
[1:20:20] footsteps than to have his character all
[1:20:23] my doctrine all my understanding
[1:20:25] everything that I do in my life
[1:20:27] hey it's it's secondary to this one
[1:20:30] thing that let it let all of my
[1:20:33] understanding let all of my knowledge
[1:20:35] let it lead me to be like Jesus Christ
[1:20:38] oh I just feel today to say that I want
[1:20:42] to walk in his footsteps
[1:20:43] I want to think like Christ the whole I
[1:20:45] want to act like he thought I want to
[1:20:48] react like he reacted that's really what
[1:20:50] Christian living is really about the
[1:20:52] Bible says they were first called
[1:20:54] Christians at Antioch what was it they
[1:20:57] didn't give themself the label of
[1:20:58] Christians they didn't say we're
[1:21:00] Christians but the Bible says the world
[1:21:02] labelled them Christians because
[1:21:05] Christian means to be like Christ oh my
[1:21:09] friend today I want to say to the Lord
[1:21:12] Lord I want to walk like you I want to
[1:21:14] walk in your very footsteps I want to
[1:21:17] think like Jesus I want to act like
[1:21:19] Jesus I want my reactions to be like him
[1:21:22] I want my discipline I want to be
[1:21:24] tempered like Christ was tempered I want
[1:21:27] my disposition how did he look at
[1:21:30] humanity how did he look at the at the
[1:21:32] at the sick how did he look at those
[1:21:34] that were in sin let me look through his
[1:21:37] eyes let me think like he thought let me
[1:21:40] speak like he spoke Lord that's my
[1:21:43] desire today to be like Jesus alright a
[1:21:47] note of that you said no matter how do I
[1:21:49] be like Jesus you've got to walk in his
[1:21:51] footsteps you've got to walk after his
[1:21:53] pathway you've got to read the Word of
[1:21:55] God and see the examples of men and
[1:21:58] women who left us an example of how not
[1:22:01] to live of how to live of where to go
[1:22:04] where not to go of what to do of what
[1:22:06] not to do I want to say Lord I want to
[1:22:09] be like you I want to live like you I
[1:22:12] want to follow in your footsteps Oh I
[1:22:16] want to thank like Jesus I want to have
[1:22:19] his mind
[1:22:19] I want to react like he reacted I'm
[1:22:22] talking about the man Christ Jesus what
[1:22:25] was it he was the perfect embodiment of
[1:22:27] the word living in a human vessel he was
[1:22:31] 100% human 100% God it was the god man
[1:22:34] oh and I want to say Lord let me think
[1:22:37] like you let me talk like you let me
[1:22:40] feel as you felt Oh Lord let me walk as
[1:22:44] you look uh as you walked I want to have
[1:22:46] your patience I want to have I want to
[1:22:49] have your love Lord I want to have your
[1:22:51] temper I want want to have your eyes I
[1:22:54] want to have your ears oh when I hear
[1:22:56] the sirens sound of the world and
[1:22:58] calamity how would Jesus react oh it's
[1:23:01] very simple message this morning but I
[1:23:03] believe it's striking the heart of you
[1:23:04] today that the sameness is cliche what
[1:23:08] would Jesus do but I believe the bride
[1:23:10] of Jesus Christ is the one who truly has
[1:23:12] a desire to say Lord and everything in
[1:23:15] my life in every aspect of my life let
[1:23:18] my let my life follow in the footsteps
[1:23:20] of Christ I want to be like Jesus I want
[1:23:24] his life living through me
[1:23:28] oh that's why we have the life of st.
[1:23:30] Paul recorded he was a man who followed
[1:23:33] in the footsteps of Christ that's why he
[1:23:35] said follow me as I follow Christ he was
[1:23:40] a man who learned contentment oh we see
[1:23:43] this resounding cry from the Apostle
[1:23:46] Paul that I may know him in the power of
[1:23:50] his resurrection you know there's a song
[1:23:52] that has a very profound meaning and we
[1:23:56] sing it at church all of you know it it
[1:23:58] says Jesus has a tablespread where the
[1:24:01] saints of God are fed he invites his
[1:24:03] chosen people come and dine it's
[1:24:07] speaking of a table and you'll find this
[1:24:09] all throughout scripture here that table
[1:24:13] is in the heavenly places and the Bible
[1:24:15] says that by faith you're to be seated
[1:24:17] with Christ in heavenly places in your
[1:24:20] daily life Paul says this in Ephesians
[1:24:23] chapter 2 verse 6 he says we have been
[1:24:26] raised up and made to sit together in
[1:24:29] heavenly places in Christ Jesus let me
[1:24:31] take this jacket off just getting just a
[1:24:33] little bit warm here today he says we've
[1:24:36] were sitting together in heavenly places
[1:24:38] in Christ Jesus so jesus said to his
[1:24:41] disciples in Luke chapter 22 verse 29 he
[1:24:45] says I appoint unto you a kingdom as my
[1:24:48] father has appointed unto me that you
[1:24:51] may eat and drink at my table in my
[1:24:54] kingdom men like Moses and Aaron and
[1:24:58] Nate AB and Abihu the elders of Israel
[1:25:01] all of these men ate at the Lord's table
[1:25:04] what does it mean to eat at the Lord's
[1:25:07] table we see that word table throughout
[1:25:09] all of the Bible G David speaks evidence
[1:25:12] AAM's 23 says now prepares the table
[1:25:14] before me in the presence of my enemies
[1:25:16] at Mount Sinai I the Bible says and they
[1:25:20] saw the God of Israel and this is Exodus
[1:25:23] 24 verse 9 and there was under his feet
[1:25:26] as it were a paved work of sapphire
[1:25:28] stone and as it were the body of heaven
[1:25:32] and clearness and upon the nobles of the
[1:25:35] children of Israel he laid not his hand
[1:25:37] also they saw God and noticed this and
[1:25:40] did
[1:25:41] eat and drink what an awesome picture
[1:25:44] the Bible paints for us here 74 men of
[1:25:49] God seated with him eating and drinking
[1:25:51] what was it it wasn't an actual table
[1:25:53] and it wasn't a natural food it was a
[1:25:56] spiritual table with spiritual food and
[1:25:59] there was a spiritual appetite that they
[1:26:01] had oh the Bible says that Moses
[1:26:04] couldn't take it it was it was though
[1:26:06] the scripture says here that that not
[1:26:09] only only Moses could take it it was
[1:26:11] over their heads Aaron comes down from
[1:26:13] that table and what does he do he makes
[1:26:15] a golden calf they'd have an Abba who
[1:26:17] offer strange fire but the Bible says
[1:26:19] Moses ate at the table of God he aid and
[1:26:22] he drank and the presence of God the
[1:26:26] king of Israel noticed this it was a
[1:26:28] great honor to be assigned a seat at the
[1:26:31] special table even the kings of Israel
[1:26:33] had a royal table
[1:26:34] David assigned a seat at his table
[1:26:38] thermofit mephibosheth do you read that
[1:26:41] in the Bible the scripture says in 2nd
[1:26:43] Samuel chapter nine verse seven and
[1:26:44] David said unto Him fear not for I will
[1:26:47] surely show thee kindness for Jonathan
[1:26:49] thy father's sake and will restore the
[1:26:52] all the land of Saul I noticed what he
[1:26:55] says and thou shalt eat bread at my
[1:26:58] table continually your your mind could
[1:27:02] go to the queen of sheba where my mind
[1:27:03] went the Bible says that this queen of
[1:27:06] sheba marveled at the glory of solomon
[1:27:09] marveled at his royal table Eliz men
[1:27:12] came up and how they went down how they
[1:27:14] said at feasts and how they ate and how
[1:27:16] they drank the bible says it left her
[1:27:18] breathless notice in second chronicles 9
[1:27:21] verse 4 the meat of his table and the
[1:27:24] sitting of his servants the attendants
[1:27:26] of his ministers and their apparel and
[1:27:27] his cupbearers also the queen of sheba
[1:27:31] seen something she she says him she says
[1:27:34] happy are they men and happy are thy
[1:27:37] servants which stand before thee and
[1:27:39] hear thy wisdom the Bible says that
[1:27:43] Nehemiah said in Nehemiah 5:17 there
[1:27:47] were at my table 150 of the Jews and
[1:27:50] rulers besides those that came unto us
[1:27:52] from among the
[1:27:53] even and they're about us so it was
[1:27:54] Royal tables you'll find this all the
[1:27:57] way we just quoted David thou preparest
[1:27:59] a table there was something special
[1:28:01] about eating at the table of the Lord
[1:28:03] there was something special about the
[1:28:05] food and the meat that he was going to
[1:28:08] give I'm trying to show you that in the
[1:28:10] Old Testament there was a type and there
[1:28:12] was a shadow it was of a royal table a
[1:28:15] heavenly table and the people that were
[1:28:18] assigned to seated that kingly table
[1:28:20] called a great honor to be part of that
[1:28:25] royal table
[1:28:26] David was assigned a seat at Saul's
[1:28:28] royal table you read the story of his
[1:28:31] life he was to sit at the table of Saul
[1:28:34] and it was a very dangerous spot to sit
[1:28:36] this jealous King like Saul so David
[1:28:40] gets with Jonathan to leave his seated
[1:28:43] it to see whether or not Saul really
[1:28:45] sought to kill him and Jonathan says
[1:28:47] thou shalt be missed because thy seed
[1:28:49] will be empty and David's definitely
[1:28:52] left that seat and it was an empty seat
[1:28:54] and the Bible says in the King sat upon
[1:28:57] his seat by the wall and David's place
[1:28:59] was empty
[1:29:00] so last wherefore cometh none of the son
[1:29:03] of Jesse to the table neither yesterday
[1:29:05] nor today I thought it was so amazing
[1:29:08] the spiritual significance you could
[1:29:09] draw out of this
[1:29:11] we know Saul wasn't a type of Christ at
[1:29:13] all nor was his table a type of the
[1:29:16] table we're speaking of today but in the
[1:29:18] Old Testament the table of kings and a
[1:29:21] type and a shadow was it was a picture
[1:29:23] of the Lord's table the kingly table the
[1:29:27] Royal table Paul speaks of this in first
[1:29:30] Corinthians 5 verse 8 he says let us
[1:29:32] keep the feast in other words he was
[1:29:37] saying that we've been we've been
[1:29:39] assigned a seat we've been given a seat
[1:29:42] at the table of God to eat of the Lord
[1:29:44] oh don't leave your seat empty don't
[1:29:48] don't don't don't don't be assigned a
[1:29:50] seat at the table of God and then never
[1:29:52] eat at it never find yourself there
[1:29:54] feasting upon it but Paul says let us
[1:29:57] keep the feast I say Lord let it never
[1:30:01] be said unto me thy seed is empty but
[1:30:03] let me eat it your feast that you've
[1:30:05] prepared unto me
[1:30:07] let it never be said o my brother my
[1:30:10] sister I think of this here and I just
[1:30:14] want to make sure I don't lose myself in
[1:30:15] this because I have something else I
[1:30:17] want to come to
[1:30:18] but you notice this that this heavenly
[1:30:21] table that he speaks of ever since the
[1:30:24] that Jesus was crucified at Calvary you
[1:30:28] notice all of the every every man of God
[1:30:31] who lived for God and every el you take
[1:30:34] Paul you take Peter you take anybody in
[1:30:37] the Bible they become they then there
[1:30:39] was a desire and over whelming desire in
[1:30:44] their life all the way up to their death
[1:30:46] where they were lamenting and crying to
[1:30:48] say all want to know him by the power of
[1:30:50] his resurrection Paul says to know
[1:30:52] Christ to live for Christ is game to
[1:30:55] live in this world as lost it was his
[1:30:58] greatest desire to know God to know him
[1:31:01] in the power of his resurrection it was
[1:31:03] the same way with his disciples and all
[1:31:05] the early church fathers you look at
[1:31:08] Luther look at swingley the Puritans
[1:31:10] they no matter what you who you want to
[1:31:12] read about her men you want to read
[1:31:14] about like what John Wesley a Whitfield
[1:31:17] and and and and T Austin sparks it was
[1:31:20] it was the desire of this early church
[1:31:23] to know him above all revelation above
[1:31:26] all mystery above all doctrine above all
[1:31:29] dress code above all knowledge there was
[1:31:32] an overwhelming desire that could that
[1:31:34] that was in the foreground of all of
[1:31:37] that and it was this that I may know him
[1:31:39] in the power of his resurrection that I
[1:31:42] may be like him that I may have the
[1:31:44] Fellowship of his sufferings it was the
[1:31:48] desire it was it was a powerful force
[1:31:51] that drove them it was a ruling passion
[1:31:53] it was an it was an ever increasing
[1:31:57] desire to know God by revelation to know
[1:32:00] him in the power of his word on not
[1:32:04] earthly things not earthly successes not
[1:32:06] earthly fame not earthly ambition oh
[1:32:09] they prayed for a lot of things but but
[1:32:12] they didn't pray just for blessings but
[1:32:14] they that there was a prayer for more
[1:32:16] revelation of the glory and the
[1:32:19] greatness of God that's why brother man
[1:32:21] said there's nothing greater you can ask
[1:32:22] for than for more revelation what was he
[1:32:25] saying more knowledge that wasn't what
[1:32:27] he was saying revelation of what of
[1:32:29] Christ to know him in a greater way than
[1:32:32] I've known him before it should be your
[1:32:35] desire it should be my desire every
[1:32:36] single day to say Lord I want to
[1:32:38] increase in my relationship with you I
[1:32:42] want to know you greater Lord in a
[1:32:45] greater way than what I knew you
[1:32:46] yesterday in a greater way of what at
[1:32:49] what I knew you when I was first Saved I
[1:32:50] should be ever-increasing the bight the
[1:32:53] disciples said increase our faith I'm
[1:32:55] saying Lord and crucem I increased my
[1:32:57] faith increase my love increase my
[1:33:00] knowledge Lord oh let me let me say
[1:33:03] today I want to know him in the power of
[1:33:06] his resurrection I want to know what it
[1:33:08] means to be like Jesus I want to have
[1:33:11] his desires I want to walk in his
[1:33:13] footsteps I want to know him as a
[1:33:16] brother branham was toto you don't know
[1:33:18] your Bible he says I may not know my
[1:33:20] Bible really well but I know the author
[1:33:22] really well and I say Lord more than any
[1:33:24] of my knowledge more than any of my
[1:33:26] understanding do I know you do I know
[1:33:29] the author do I know that the
[1:33:31] inspiration behind all the stories that
[1:33:33] I read about in the Bible behind all the
[1:33:36] doctrine behind all the truth and had no
[1:33:40] matter how great it is and it's a great
[1:33:41] truth that we hold but behind it all is
[1:33:43] a person who's longing for a
[1:33:46] relationship is a person who longs more
[1:33:50] than you long to know him he wants to
[1:33:52] know you he wants to fill himself he
[1:33:56] wants to fill you with his love to fill
[1:33:58] you with his power to fill you with his
[1:34:00] inspiration to fail you with his vision
[1:34:03] to fill you with his thoughts to fill
[1:34:06] you with his word fresh every day my
[1:34:10] brother my sister you need a fresh
[1:34:11] inspiration from God every day of your
[1:34:13] life and God wants to give it to you
[1:34:16] more than you want it today oh it was an
[1:34:20] overwhelming and call encompassing
[1:34:23] filling from the Apostle Paul that I may
[1:34:26] know him in the power of his
[1:34:30] resurrection in the power of his
[1:34:32] immeasurable 'ti
[1:34:34] he's a limitless God he's an immense God
[1:34:37] he's boundless
[1:34:39] he's overwhelming he's greater than you
[1:34:41] could ever know that's why brother
[1:34:43] Branham said even in in the even even in
[1:34:46] in in eternity he'll still be unfolding
[1:34:49] himself he'll still be revealing himself
[1:34:53] I'm so glad for that and I want to know
[1:34:55] him in every way that I could know him
[1:34:57] today Paul says in him we live and move
[1:35:01] and have our being in him we live in who
[1:35:09] for the believer in his life is life all
[1:35:11] their life all their existence is
[1:35:14] wrapped up in one interest and that's
[1:35:17] Christ one desire and that's to live
[1:35:20] like Jesus oh that's to have his Holy
[1:35:23] Spirit drawing us that's the Hiva spirit
[1:35:27] calling us that's his Holy Spirit
[1:35:28] wanting his Holy Spirit to enable us all
[1:35:32] I believe it's the cry of a true
[1:35:33] believer today to say Lord let your
[1:35:36] spirit have full sway in my life and let
[1:35:39] my mind and not not be so contaminated
[1:35:41] with the things of the world let it be
[1:35:43] filled with the love of Jesus let it be
[1:35:45] filled with the revelation and the
[1:35:46] knowledge of God oh let it not be
[1:35:49] something of yesterday let it be
[1:35:51] something fresh for today a true and
[1:35:54] living revelation more than anything
[1:35:57] that's what I want in my life
[1:35:59] oh the Apostle Paul was a man who walked
[1:36:02] after the Lord he was a man who knew
[1:36:05] what it was to be content Philippians
[1:36:08] chapter 4 verse 11 it says now not that
[1:36:11] I speak in respect of want for I have
[1:36:14] learned in whatsoever state I am
[1:36:17] therewith to be content I know both how
[1:36:20] to be abased I know how to abound
[1:36:22] everywhere and all things I am
[1:36:24] instructed both to be full and to be
[1:36:26] hungry both to abound and to suffer need
[1:36:29] he was he was showing us the law of
[1:36:31] contrasts of life and he says and I can
[1:36:34] do all things verse 13 through Christ
[1:36:37] which strengthens me Paul that you look
[1:36:41] at a state that he had in his life it's
[1:36:43] anything but we will it's it's anything
[1:36:45] but desirable a man who
[1:36:47] lived constantly under pressure
[1:36:52] the temporary key temporal condition of
[1:36:55] Paul was anything but desirable yet he
[1:36:58] was he was it was far from dissatisfied
[1:37:01] what you find out of the letters of PO
[1:37:04] is a man who was satisfied with life he
[1:37:06] was satisfied with Christ though
[1:37:08] afflicted those scores though beaten
[1:37:10] though thrown in jail yet he himself
[1:37:13] could learn to be content my brother my
[1:37:17] sister covetousness and contentment are
[1:37:20] diametrically opposed to each other
[1:37:23] covetousness and contentment are two
[1:37:28] opposites there's something in the world
[1:37:31] today it's a constant desire it's its
[1:37:33] greed is what it is it's for what
[1:37:36] everyone wants more than what they had
[1:37:38] yesterday it's never enough how much is
[1:37:40] enough it's never enough let me say this
[1:37:44] to you today my brother and my sister if
[1:37:46] you are not content if we are not
[1:37:48] content with those things which we have
[1:37:50] we will never be content even if we've
[1:37:54] succeed in obtaining everything we
[1:37:57] desire if you're not content with what
[1:37:59] God has given you your station and life
[1:38:01] with what you have with what he's
[1:38:04] allowed you to have you got to realize
[1:38:06] my brother my sister your earthly lot is
[1:38:09] designed by God it's given by God it's
[1:38:14] your vocation that you didn't choose now
[1:38:16] I'm speaking of Christians here your
[1:38:18] earthly lot is appointed by God the
[1:38:21] Bible says that he fixes the bounds of
[1:38:24] our habitations he fixes the bounds of
[1:38:28] our habitation what does that mean that
[1:38:31] means he's not just a creator
[1:38:33] he's also the governor huh that's a very
[1:38:35] big difference between the creator and
[1:38:37] the governor God is not just the Creator
[1:38:39] he's also the governor of all things
[1:38:42] everything is controlled in the world by
[1:38:46] him every circumstance which transpires
[1:38:50] is under his watch he's uh knits under
[1:38:54] his control it's under his order he said
[1:39:00] brother how do I see that for my
[1:39:01] life everything in your life is governed
[1:39:04] by God everything that happens to you in
[1:39:08] your life job said there's nothing what
[1:39:09] we learn from the story of job is the
[1:39:11] Satan couldn't do anything because God
[1:39:13] had put a hedge around him unless God
[1:39:15] gave him permission to do it so he's not
[1:39:17] just the creator of your lot in life
[1:39:19] he's also the governor
[1:39:21] he's also the protector he's also the
[1:39:23] orchestrator he's the keys the he's the
[1:39:26] conductor of everything that's happening
[1:39:29] and you've got to hear his voice in
[1:39:31] order to see his hand in your life
[1:39:33] you've got to hear his voice in your
[1:39:35] life you've got to hear that still small
[1:39:38] voice to say whatever comes your way
[1:39:41] child I I counted the sparrows I know
[1:39:44] every Sparrow that falls I've numbered
[1:39:46] the hair of your head in other words I'm
[1:39:49] intricately acquainted with everything
[1:39:51] that happens in your life some people
[1:39:53] don't think God is concerned with every
[1:39:55] little thing that happens God is
[1:39:57] concerned with every little detail in
[1:39:59] your life day to day life
[1:40:02] say brother Matt how can that be because
[1:40:04] he's big enough
[1:40:05] he's great enough to be involved not
[1:40:08] only in every big thing but also every
[1:40:11] little thing because even in the mind of
[1:40:14] God there's no there's really no
[1:40:16] distinction in your life between great
[1:40:18] we haven't we measure of great and small
[1:40:21] vast and minut but to God the Bible says
[1:40:25] that then that he numbers the stars of
[1:40:27] the heaven you say that's great that's
[1:40:30] numerous the stars of the heaven but it
[1:40:32] also says he also numbers the hair on
[1:40:34] your head so he's not just in the great
[1:40:36] he's also in the small it's showing that
[1:40:39] God it's showing that to God everything
[1:40:42] is the same size or let me say it this
[1:40:44] way everything is just as important the
[1:40:48] big things and the little things are
[1:40:50] important to God in your life the same
[1:40:52] God who commissions angels and Seraphim
[1:40:55] z-- to stand before his throne saying to
[1:40:58] them come and he comes into another and
[1:41:00] he goes the same one who controls the
[1:41:03] vastness of the universe this great
[1:41:05] mighty by large incomprehensible God
[1:41:09] regards with tender compassion
[1:41:12] even the poor little sparrow which falls
[1:41:16] unnoticed to the ground how much more
[1:41:19] does he care for you and care for me
[1:41:21] today
[1:41:21] you see friend there's nothing there's
[1:41:23] no such thing as chance there is in the
[1:41:25] world and luck there's no such thing as
[1:41:29] chance in the kingdom of God God the
[1:41:31] Bible says it's God who makes rich it's
[1:41:34] God who makes poor it's God who brings
[1:41:36] low it's God who lifts up whatever
[1:41:40] happens to us is by his appointment you
[1:41:46] say brother Matt why is that important
[1:41:47] because that's how you can learn to be
[1:41:49] content with whatever you have and
[1:41:52] wherever you find yourself when you know
[1:41:55] it's your heavenly Father who has called
[1:41:58] the shots in your life you can be
[1:42:00] content no matter what you have or what
[1:42:02] you don't have
[1:42:03] oh that's why God gave us the story of
[1:42:06] Job
[1:42:07] you notice job falls from the greatest
[1:42:09] to the lowest just overnight the Bible
[1:42:12] says he he an adversity he spun yet he
[1:42:17] somehow he saw the hand of God in
[1:42:18] everything that happened in his life
[1:42:21] he'll he falls to his knees and prays to
[1:42:24] God and says I naked I came into the
[1:42:26] world from my mother's womb and naked
[1:42:27] I'll return the Lord gave me everything
[1:42:30] I had and the Lord has taken to the way
[1:42:33] praise the name of the Lord huh the
[1:42:37] Bible says and all these things job's
[1:42:39] sinned not you know to murmur against
[1:42:42] God and I was going this way
[1:42:44] intentionally because the Holy Spirit
[1:42:45] directed me this way to murmur at God to
[1:42:48] be dissatisfied with the lot which has
[1:42:52] been appointed to us to always be
[1:42:54] complaining over one circumstance or
[1:42:56] another is to charge God with wrongdoing
[1:43:00] it's to attribute failure to Him who is
[1:43:05] the only one with wisdom and knowledge
[1:43:08] and understanding he is the only one who
[1:43:11] is in finite infinite is the infinite
[1:43:14] God let me just say this to you and I'll
[1:43:17] just make it real simple whatever the
[1:43:19] Lord has given us let us learn to be
[1:43:23] content why are you preaching on
[1:43:25] contentment
[1:43:26] because Paul said and all things I've
[1:43:28] learned to be content and what was Paul
[1:43:31] he was a footstep that we could follow
[1:43:33] him said I want to be like Jesus then be
[1:43:36] like Paul even brother branham said all
[1:43:38] the messengers to all seven ages he says
[1:43:40] that that last messenger would be just
[1:43:42] like Paul be just like him in every way
[1:43:44] because Paul followed Christ and he says
[1:43:47] as I follow follow me as I follow Christ
[1:43:49] imitate me as I'm imitating Christ
[1:43:52] whatever he gives us thankfully receive
[1:43:56] it and be content whatever he denies us
[1:43:59] let us be satisfied without whatever it
[1:44:03] was he denied whatever he takes from us
[1:44:06] let us part with it whatever trial he
[1:44:09] lays on us let us patiently bear it oh
[1:44:12] can you say man to the Word of God today
[1:44:14] we shall thus be still and know he is
[1:44:19] God and we shall honor and magnify and
[1:44:23] bless his name what does the Bible say
[1:44:26] says will eat the but we may have to eat
[1:44:29] the bread of trouble
[1:44:30] we may have to drink the waters of
[1:44:33] affliction we may not understand our
[1:44:35] affliction but we don't have to when we
[1:44:38] have a real revelation that God never
[1:44:41] makes a mistake that he's too perfect to
[1:44:44] ever mess up that he's too kind and too
[1:44:47] loving and compassionate to ever hurt
[1:44:50] his children nothing he ever does is to
[1:44:53] hurt us my brother when you get this
[1:44:56] revelation you can say like the Apostle
[1:45:00] Paul I am a possessor of all things
[1:45:04] glory no matter what pressure you have
[1:45:07] no matter what trials or afflictions no
[1:45:11] matter what you have in your life you
[1:45:13] can say I possess all things because I
[1:45:16] possess Christ because I'm a son or
[1:45:20] daughter of God and I am an heir of
[1:45:24] eternal life 1st Peter 1:3 what we read
[1:45:28] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:45:30] Lord Jesus Christ which according to his
[1:45:32] abundant mercy has begotten us again
[1:45:35] unto a lively hope by the resurrection
[1:45:37] of Jesus Christ from the dead
[1:45:40] what does that lively hope give us it
[1:45:42] gives us contentment instead of
[1:45:44] covetousness it gives us steadfastness
[1:45:48] instead of instability it gives us
[1:45:51] humility in the place of pride it gives
[1:45:54] us it but we we please God rather than
[1:45:58] pleasing men it gives us unity rather
[1:46:01] than division we look to the things of
[1:46:04] heaven rather than the things of earth
[1:46:06] and where there's timidity where you're
[1:46:08] timid God gives you courage oh where
[1:46:11] there's the works of the flesh he
[1:46:13] replaces the works of the flesh with the
[1:46:15] fruits of the Spirit and instead of
[1:46:18] murmuring he gives us submission and
[1:46:20] contentment
[1:46:20] instead of lukewarmness we have zeal
[1:46:23] instead of pride
[1:46:25] we have humility you know the Bible says
[1:46:28] pride goeth before the fall and a
[1:46:31] haughty spirit before destruction that's
[1:46:33] why first Peter 5:5 says be clothed in
[1:46:36] humility I say Lord let me be clothed in
[1:46:40] humility and not arrogance and pride
[1:46:45] that's what the Apostle Paul describes
[1:46:48] the the Apostles disposition how they
[1:46:51] lived were preaching on in the footsteps
[1:46:52] of Christ it says not to think of
[1:46:55] ourselves more highly than we ought to
[1:46:57] think but to think soberly according as
[1:47:00] God has dealt to every man the measure
[1:47:03] of faith I read a writer and it was
[1:47:05] amazing what he said he said upon this
[1:47:08] subject too much stress cannot be laid
[1:47:11] for without humility true religion
[1:47:14] cannot possibly exist a proud Christian
[1:47:18] is a contradiction in terms we might as
[1:47:20] well speak of a wise fool of a wicked
[1:47:23] saint of a sober drunkard of a chaste
[1:47:26] harlot as of a proud Christian we may as
[1:47:30] soon expect delicate flowers to flourish
[1:47:33] in the frozen and barren regions of
[1:47:35] Serbia as that true priety should grow
[1:47:38] in the heart that is proud and haughty a
[1:47:41] vine might as well thrive when a worm is
[1:47:45] knowing at its root as that the soul
[1:47:48] should prosper and be in health when its
[1:47:50] arrogance and pride are not subdued
[1:47:53] oh I say lord give me humility that I
[1:47:59] may flourish replace my pride and
[1:48:01] arrogance with humility and submission
[1:48:03] to God you can see the footsteps of a
[1:48:06] man like David we follow his footsteps
[1:48:09] who speaks of himself as a worm job
[1:48:13] cried out and says behold I am vile
[1:48:15] the Apostle Paul said if anyone could be
[1:48:18] proud it would be me but what were the
[1:48:21] Apostle Paul's views about himself and
[1:48:24] when you when you when Paul references
[1:48:26] himself he says I above all should be I
[1:48:29] should be gloating in arrogance and
[1:48:31] pride Oh Paul says I'm not even worthy
[1:48:34] to be called an apostle in another place
[1:48:38] he says I'm less than the least of all
[1:48:40] of God's people even when he's writing
[1:48:43] the but the lie one of the last epistles
[1:48:45] he designates himself as the chief of
[1:48:48] sinners Paul had an estimation of
[1:48:51] himself remember Paul was one who walked
[1:48:53] in the footsteps of Christ he was
[1:48:56] brought to know himself a knowledge the
[1:48:59] Bible says he says Paul says I am the
[1:49:03] chief of sinners he was brought to know
[1:49:08] himself a knowledge we are told in which
[1:49:11] all wisdom sinners if we know ourselves
[1:49:15] as Paul did pride and self delight would
[1:49:19] find no room within us I say Lord let it
[1:49:23] not find any room within me but about
[1:49:26] all of that you said brother Matt Paul
[1:49:28] Paul's a good example but above all of
[1:49:30] that let's look to the chief Shepherd
[1:49:32] let's consider the one who said take my
[1:49:35] yoke upon you and learn from me for I am
[1:49:40] gentle and humble in heart all the Bible
[1:49:45] says all the heavens couldn't declare
[1:49:46] him all the heavens couldn't contain him
[1:49:49] all the fullness of the Godhead was
[1:49:52] bodied in this man Christ Jesus
[1:49:55] everything that was in God he poured
[1:49:58] into Christ o devils trembled at the
[1:50:03] words of Jesus Christ are they flew from
[1:50:06] his
[1:50:06] presents Oh though yet but yet how great
[1:50:09] this man was but yet how gentle and how
[1:50:13] humble how lonely all want to say Lord
[1:50:17] let me conform to that image of Christ
[1:50:20] let my life be an example in his
[1:50:23] humility Oh in the words of the Apostle
[1:50:26] Paul he would say do nothing out of
[1:50:29] selfish ambition or vain conceit but in
[1:50:32] humility consider others better than
[1:50:36] your self the Word says not to look
[1:50:40] after your own interest that's what the
[1:50:42] Bible says but to look after the
[1:50:44] interest of others your attitude should
[1:50:47] be the same my attitude should be the
[1:50:50] same as Jesus's attitude and I say Lord
[1:50:53] let me walk in those footsteps notice
[1:50:59] these Christians as we close here these
[1:51:02] believers are there in the book of Acts
[1:51:04] that we read about we know this was the
[1:51:06] ephesian church the Bible describes such
[1:51:09] a group that was so fervent they were so
[1:51:12] zealous for the Lord they they were so
[1:51:14] what we could say we're so close to the
[1:51:17] Lord Jesus
[1:51:18] they they they walked so closely ah the
[1:51:21] letter their to the Lord
[1:51:23] I you can read the the Paul's letters to
[1:51:26] the Ephesians and notice what Paul is
[1:51:28] Paul begins to compliment them in
[1:51:30] Ephesians 1 verse 1 and 80 addresses
[1:51:33] them and says you're the faithful in
[1:51:35] Christ Jesus you're blessed this is the
[1:51:38] Ephesians you're blessed with all
[1:51:40] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[1:51:42] in Christ you're chosen before the
[1:51:44] foundation of the world predestinated
[1:51:47] unto the adoption of children by Jesus
[1:51:49] Christ to himself according to the good
[1:51:51] pleasure of his will
[1:51:53] Paul describes this group is faithful
[1:51:56] this is the Ephesians now he describes
[1:51:58] them as faithful blessed chosen in
[1:52:01] another place he says that there are
[1:52:04] forgiving people he says that having the
[1:52:07] mystery of Christ being sealed with the
[1:52:10] Spirit of promises verse 13 and he
[1:52:13] further prays that they would have the
[1:52:15] spirit of wisdom and revelation in the
[1:52:17] knowledge of him the
[1:52:19] eyes of your understanding being
[1:52:21] enlightened that you may know him the
[1:52:22] exceeding greatness of his power to us
[1:52:25] word who believe the Bible makes it
[1:52:27] clear these believers who had been
[1:52:29] quickened they had been made alive in
[1:52:32] Christ he says in chapter 2 of Ephesians
[1:52:35] verse 5
[1:52:36] you've been quickened with Christ who
[1:52:38] has raised this up together made us to
[1:52:40] sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:52:42] krempe Paul calls him the workmanship of
[1:52:45] Christ created in Christ Jesus unto good
[1:52:50] works verse 13 and are made nigh by the
[1:52:53] blood of Jesus Christ he says that by
[1:52:55] God's grace and verse 21 they're growing
[1:52:58] into a holy temple in the Lord through
[1:53:01] the spirit what a description of a
[1:53:04] blessed chosen cold people a holy people
[1:53:08] holy nation a peculiar priesthood even
[1:53:13] in the Book of Revelations we know this
[1:53:15] is speaking of the age jesus also says I
[1:53:18] know thy works and thy labour verse 2
[1:53:21] and thy patience in other words he's
[1:53:24] saying all the good deeds all the good
[1:53:27] things in your life your patients that
[1:53:28] you labor for me without complain and
[1:53:31] you'll do anything for others you give
[1:53:32] up anything for anybody you're diligent
[1:53:35] and your good works and I'm commending
[1:53:37] you for it
[1:53:39] say brother Matt what are you trying to
[1:53:41] point out I'm trying to point out to you
[1:53:42] that as they were the Alpha so are we
[1:53:44] the Omega as they were that first seed
[1:53:46] church so that church comes again in the
[1:53:50] last age that's who you are my brother
[1:53:52] my sister we are the Omega of the first
[1:53:54] age we are the continuation of the book
[1:53:57] of Acts church we are that Pentecostal
[1:54:00] church and our life should be wretch our
[1:54:03] life should be reflective of their lives
[1:54:06] and good deeds and blessings and in
[1:54:09] their patience and their virtue in their
[1:54:11] knowledge and their temperance in their
[1:54:13] wisdom and their joy in their
[1:54:15] forgiveness
[1:54:15] this wasn't a group of novices this was
[1:54:20] a group of people Jesus begins to
[1:54:23] examine this well-grounded they were
[1:54:25] grounded in the gospel of Paul they
[1:54:28] approved it in their life by sacrificing
[1:54:31] laboring and standing from the
[1:54:33] for the truth I see all your works Jesus
[1:54:35] said your hatred for sin your love for
[1:54:38] the truth
[1:54:39] your courage that you have yet in all of
[1:54:43] that somehow in all your labor you've
[1:54:47] allowed your first love to wither and he
[1:54:51] says nevertheless I have somewhat
[1:54:54] against thee because thou has left thy
[1:54:57] first love you said brother Matt what
[1:55:03] are you trying to say today I'm trying
[1:55:05] to get you to see a picture here trying
[1:55:08] to say to get you a picture here that
[1:55:09] the most important thing more than more
[1:55:12] than all of your doctrine more than all
[1:55:14] of your good works should be a life
[1:55:17] that's following the footsteps of Jesus
[1:55:19] Christ constantly following we shall
[1:55:22] know if we continue on to know it's not
[1:55:25] enough for you to be caring giving
[1:55:27] diligent serving those grieving over sin
[1:55:31] preaching the truth it's not enough for
[1:55:33] you to uphold good moral standards it's
[1:55:36] not enough just to endure hardness or
[1:55:39] I'll consider this way it's not enough
[1:55:40] to even be burned at the stake to give
[1:55:42] your very life it's all part that's all
[1:55:45] part of you living as a Christian you
[1:55:47] can do all these things in 9 and my name
[1:55:50] but if in the process of doing them your
[1:55:53] affection for me
[1:55:54] for who Jesus decreases and doesn't
[1:55:59] increase if I'm not being more diligent
[1:56:02] in my heart and my River if I'm not
[1:56:04] being more and more in the delight of my
[1:56:06] heart than let me just be honest my
[1:56:08] brother my sister I've left my first
[1:56:10] love if my knowledge if my desire to be
[1:56:13] more like Jesus if your affection if my
[1:56:17] affection is no longer a great concern
[1:56:20] than Jesus says I have something against
[1:56:24] you you've left your first love you've
[1:56:30] left your first love
[1:56:32] Oh consider what David says he says in
[1:56:36] Psalm 73 verse 25 whom have I in heaven
[1:56:39] but thee and there is none upon the
[1:56:42] earth that I desire beside thee notice
[1:56:45] these words of David
[1:56:46] David's not saying I don't have human
[1:56:48] love he knows God blesses good human
[1:56:52] love but David is saying there's no one
[1:56:54] I love exclusively in my heart as I love
[1:56:57] the Lord I desire him above all others
[1:57:01] he says in Psalm 6 verse 3 you know this
[1:57:03] very well
[1:57:04] o God my soul thirsteth for thee my
[1:57:07] flesh longeth for thee in a dry and
[1:57:11] thirsty land where there know wot where
[1:57:13] no water is Psalms 42 is the heart as
[1:57:17] the deer panteth after the water Brooks
[1:57:18] own panic my soul after the old God my
[1:57:22] soul thirsteth for God for the Living
[1:57:24] God David saying I thirst for the Living
[1:57:28] God the way a deer thirst for after it's
[1:57:31] been chased a deer will go past the
[1:57:33] point of exhaustion to find water that
[1:57:36] it seeks because it's seeking something
[1:57:39] it's seeking something daily to live
[1:57:42] like Jesus to walk like Jesus to be in
[1:57:46] harmony with the spirit to be in harmony
[1:57:48] with his love to live constantly for him
[1:57:51] to think like him to walk in his very
[1:57:55] footsteps and all my brother and my
[1:57:57] sister today as I closed this message
[1:57:59] out to you today I say Lord let me walk
[1:58:02] in the footsteps of Christ Oh what his
[1:58:05] first Peter say he says in verse 21 for
[1:58:09] here and who you were called because
[1:58:11] Christ also suffered leaving us an
[1:58:14] example that you should follow his steps
[1:58:19] who did no sin neither was guile found
[1:58:22] in his mouth who when he was reviled
[1:58:25] reviled not again when he suffered he
[1:58:27] threatened not but committed himself to
[1:58:30] Hume that judged righteously I say Lord
[1:58:34] let my life be a portrait of Jesus
[1:58:38] beyond all my knowing beyond all my all
[1:58:43] my standards all my good standards all
[1:58:46] my dress code beyond all of my knowledge
[1:58:49] but I want to challenge I want to
[1:58:52] challenge you here today my brother my
[1:58:54] sister I want you to ask as the Holy
[1:58:56] Spirit is it's just real close right now

[1:58:59] scare to say Lord do I live like Jesus
[1:59:02] do I talk like Jesus do I do act like
[1:59:05] you do I live like you is my temper like
[1:59:08] you or am I find myself with pride when
[1:59:11] there should be humility do I find
[1:59:13] myself with a temper when there should
[1:59:16] be meekness and lowliness and humility
[1:59:18] do I find my compassion for others to
[1:59:22] find myself compassionate for those that
[1:59:24] are less fortunate or do I find myself
[1:59:26] looking with arrogance and with pride
[1:59:30] what would Jesus do how would Jesus act
[1:59:35] we see the life of Paul we could follow
[1:59:37] the life of his footsteps we could
[1:59:39] follow his footsteps we could follow the
[1:59:41] life of brother branham oh the life of a
[1:59:44] prophet who we had in our generation the
[1:59:46] messenger to this age Oh were we could
[1:59:49] we can see that he was we can see that
[1:59:51] he had mistakes he he he got in a truck
[1:59:54] one data to go kill a boy took a gun
[1:59:57] loaded gun to go Bo's brains out what
[2:00:00] was it God was showing not just the
[2:00:01] highlights but the lowlights
[2:00:03] he could get on a telephone call and
[2:00:05] under pressure he could tell a lie and
[2:00:08] tell him I'm not here tell him I'm gone
[2:00:10] away but yet the same Holy Spirit could
[2:00:12] come and begin to convict that man and
[2:00:15] could begin to speak to that man that
[2:00:17] same Spirit of God who spoke through
[2:00:19] that man that the same Spirit of God who
[2:00:22] came in correction the same Holy Spirit
[2:00:24] who come to draw that man to a closer
[2:00:26] walk to correction and to obedience and
[2:00:29] humility is the same spirit that can

[2:00:45] spite of all the times where I've not
[2:00:47] followed after the footsteps of Christ
[2:00:49] yet that tender Holy Spirit can come and
[2:00:53] chastise me can come and rebuke me and I
[2:00:55] could say Lord I'm gonna be zealous I'm
