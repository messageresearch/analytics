[16:11] just the
[16:12] the wonderful

[16:17] brought things
[16:18] to be and
[16:19] you spoke life into existence and
[16:23] and here we are thousands of years of
[16:26] of human existence and
[16:28] really it's all
[16:30] just to
[16:31] work itself back to
[16:34] real communion with you and we have that
[16:38] still on the horizon lord and i i
[16:40] believe it's
[16:42] it's very close now and

[16:45] it's marvelous this story of salvation
[16:48] that you've written and

[16:54] i
[16:55] it's
[16:56] i
[16:57] i love to
[16:58] try to

[17:07] it just makes me feel like you're
[17:10] standing next to me lord

[17:25] those here you know all things you know
[17:28] each one each
[17:30] each soul is very special

[17:46] him the bible says and you loved him and
[17:48] even though
[17:49] brother branham kind of tells us the end
[17:51] of that story but
[17:54] despite of that you looked on him when
[17:56] he was here on earth and you loved him
[18:00] [Music]
[18:02] if that's the case there
[18:05] what do you think about us it's hard to
[18:07] imagine maybe but

[31:02] great because
[31:04] let me tell you then this i can prove by
[31:07] the word that there are angels that we
[31:11] cannot see there are beings in this
[31:14] building
[31:15] that are present with us that we cannot
[31:18] see with our natural eyes brother jeremy
[31:20] they are here
[31:22] and
[31:23] and as i minister today i pray that not
[31:26] only
[31:27] that i please
[31:28] them
[31:29] and please you all but most of all of
[31:32] all that i please the lord jesus
[31:36] it's uh
[31:37] i'd like to say is everybody feeling
[31:39] better because i think everybody got
[31:41] sick and the ones that are better now
[31:43] are here right
[31:45] it was the strangest thing i got sick
[31:48] and
[31:49] i got the flu
[31:50] and
[31:51] then
[31:52] as a few days came by thank you jordan
[31:55] as as a few days went by
[31:57] then i got a different set of symptoms
[32:00] and uh
[32:02] i stuck my face in a bag of coffee and i
[32:05] couldn't smell a thing
[32:06] it was the weirdest thing that that when
[32:09] you lose your smell and your taste
[32:11] and uh
[32:13] today my wife was putting on some lotion
[32:16] on her hands and i smelled it it was
[32:17] like most beautiful thing in the world
[32:19] so so i i think i'm i'm on the way back
[32:23] brother david it's good to see you
[32:25] there you know i appreciated your prayer
[32:28] this morning or tonight
[32:31] about the rich young ruler that that
[32:33] story has always struck my heart and
[32:35] it's always been something that i look
[32:37] i've looked at it and and i see that
[32:40] jesus loved this young man
[32:43] and he gave him this opportunity and it
[32:46] wasn't necessarily money
[32:49] it was it was this is what this man
[32:52] his problem was with money
[32:55] and the story is that this man that is
[32:58] what was going to keep him out of the
[33:00] kingdom
[33:01] and jesus because jesus loved him
[33:04] he said sell all that you have because
[33:05] he saw that that was what was going to
[33:07] keep him out
[33:08] so brother david you know you're praying
[33:11] that this evening it really it touched
[33:13] my heart and and i liked what you said
[33:15] you said something
[33:17] about um the story of salvation
[33:20] that that the lord has written
[33:22] and that we get to have a part in it
[33:24] brother i appreciate it that very much
[33:28] brother david's special to me not
[33:30] because he and i have been
[33:31] uh close over the years
[33:33] but brother david has been a special
[33:36] person to my son daniel
[33:39] daniel really looks up to brother david
[33:41] i mean he's a cool guy he's a fighter
[33:43] pilot for heaven's sake
[33:45] what kid wouldn't like that
[33:47] but um i remember david when
[33:50] my son met you first
[33:53] he came to me and he's like dad i met
[33:56] you know brother david and sister sharon
[33:58] and they're the greatest the greatest
[34:00] things and he's like dad they're so down

[35:06] and all that i don't see the roberts is
[35:08] here but sister roberts did so much
[35:10] sister martha did so much i was just i
[35:13] was proud to be associated with them and
[35:16] i was uh we were sitting there about
[35:18] where um stephanie's sitting
[35:20] and um
[35:22] i got a text
[35:23] and uh
[35:25] on a a
[35:26] friend from on the other side of the
[35:28] country he said hey i really like the
[35:30] beard
[35:32] i was like what
[35:33] and that camera that's up there was
[35:35] pointing right at us so then i started

[35:40] a sister texted my wife and she said um
[35:44] she says i really like your hair is it
[35:45] permed and uh who do you do who who do
[35:48] you go to to get your hair permed and
[35:50] this sister was in jeffersonville so

[35:55] thought
[35:56] i got a kick out of that um
[35:59] but uh
[36:00] yeah it's it was good i really enjoyed
[36:03] the fellowship and harmony and having
[36:06] this church full
[36:08] of of people didn't it feel good
[36:11] man i just i just loved it and having
[36:14] people worshiping the lord together and
[36:16] i
[36:17] thought back to the origins of this
[36:19] church the first message church in
[36:22] tucson and
[36:23] and
[36:24] the heritage that this church has and it
[36:27] just it blessed my heart
[36:30] so much
[36:32] i uh
[36:33] i'll share a little bit
[36:35] about myself i look here and
[36:38] on a wednesday night usually we have
[36:41] a lot of the leaders in the church
[36:43] and a lot of the other folks um i know
[36:47] there's a lot of them sick now but they
[36:49] stream in
[36:50] but those that have their post of duty
[36:53] and they come
[36:55] on wednesday night
[36:57] and
[36:59] these brothers like
[37:01] look at look at the brothers
[37:03] matthew and jordan and all the brothers
[37:06] they do so much
[37:08] and
[37:09] maybe my sermon tonight would help
[37:12] some of you all
[37:13] in the ministries that you all have
[37:15] every person that's in this building has
[37:18] this is uh my friend brother mark is
[37:20] walking in there um
[37:22] mark is one of the ones
[37:24] look back at him back there
[37:27] mark is one of the ones that remember we
[37:29] had prayer some time ago i said i met
[37:31] two guys at the gym
[37:33] and they were having problems well i
[37:34] think that uh the
[37:37] the announcement came back to those
[37:38] marital problems was actually problems
[37:40] with brother marcus having problems with
[37:42] a girl
[37:43] and uh not he's not married to her and
[37:45] and the holy spirit really stepped in
[37:48] and helped brother mark and this is the
[37:50] group by the mark that i asked to pray
[37:52] for us and pray for you and when you
[37:55] asked me that
[37:56] and the lord did he stepped in
[37:59] and he gave mark the answer to the
[38:02] question that he had on his heart and
[38:03] sometimes when the lord gives you an
[38:05] answer
[38:06] it's uh it's not necessarily the answer
[38:08] that you want isn't mine
[38:10] but we we stay loyal to the lord and and
[38:14] mark has been
[38:15] and uh he's also become a good friend of
[38:18] mine it's good to hear you thanks for
[38:20] thanks for coming my friend i appreciate
[38:22] it
[38:23] but i was um i wanted to share a little
[38:25] testimony before i get started
[38:28] and
[38:28] i preached a sermon the other day at
[38:31] shalom at
[38:32] the israel post
[38:34] and
[38:36] it was a sermon that i had preached
[38:39] before
[38:40] and the first time i preached it really
[38:43] resonated well with the people
[38:45] and it was it was talking about have you
[38:47] heard of this this young man kyle
[38:49] rittenhouse the one that uh
[38:52] he got he was somewhere that he
[38:53] shouldn't have been and he ended up
[38:55] shooting three people and the riots and
[38:57] stuff i believe is in illinois and
[39:01] and
[39:01] he um
[39:03] was brought brought to trial for murder
[39:07] and
[39:08] the
[39:09] defense attorney presented his case
[39:12] and at the end he raised up
[39:16] with his client with this young man kyle
[39:18] rittenhouse and i identified with his
[39:20] lawyer
[39:22] and
[39:22] this young man was innocent
[39:25] now he did say if he could take it if he
[39:28] could go back and do it all over again
[39:29] he wouldn't have been there
[39:31] but he was there
[39:33] and he was and he did act in
[39:35] self-defense
[39:36] and this lawyer everything was on his
[39:39] shoulders
[39:41] and he stood up with his client
[39:45] and
[39:46] then
[39:47] the verdict as they were as the verdicts
[39:49] were being read i identified with this
[39:51] lawyer and i wondered what was going
[39:53] through his mind
[39:55] and it must have been i hope i said this
[39:58] right i hope i said that right because
[39:59] this young man that i'm representing is
[40:01] innocent
[40:03] and
[40:04] as those verdicts came forth
[40:08] the um not guilty not guilty and i think
[40:12] it was five times became not guilty the
[40:14] young man just fell down he collapsed
[40:18] weeping
[40:19] and i took
[40:21] that analogy
[40:23] and i brought it back to the closing
[40:25] statements that great men of god have
[40:27] made
[40:28] which is peter you know when peter when
[40:31] he's his closing statements just before
[40:33] he went to the cross
[40:35] he said listen to paul
[40:38] do what he says
[40:40] in paul's closing statements he says i
[40:42] am about to be offered up
[40:45] and he
[40:46] and and then even the lord jesus the
[40:48] lord jesus came up and he said lord
[40:50] forgive them for they know not what they
[40:52] do
[40:53] and and i tried to relate those in these
[40:55] closing statements
[40:57] and my point in saying it it went it was
[41:00] good the first time but the second time
[41:01] when i brought it to shalom it didn't
[41:03] hit the mark
[41:05] and it didn't resonate with the people
[41:07] and i felt like lord i i made a mistake
[41:10] i um i didn't say anything that wasn't
[41:12] true
[41:14] but
[41:15] it didn't resonate with the people and
[41:18] it bothered me really bothered me and i
[41:20] prayed about it
[41:22] and i felt like i got my answer
[41:25] and my answer was well you didn't pray
[41:29] about this sermon for this group of
[41:32] people
[41:34] and and the sermon that i preached was
[41:36] good the first time i preached it but
[41:38] for the second group it wasn't
[41:39] necessarily for them so i got a little
[41:42] bit
[41:43] out of the lord's will there
[41:44] and and
[41:46] it made me think and with all the
[41:47] leaders here
[41:49] we have to take the time
[41:51] to pray
[41:53] and we have to take the time to study
[41:56] this word we have to take the time to
[41:59] listen to these sermons
[42:02] and then the lord can use us
[42:05] we have to take in that holy spirit
[42:08] and it's not always just putting
[42:10] together a sermon it's maybe it's lord
[42:13] what do you want to say to me
[42:15] today
[42:16] and i i think that i have
[42:19] something special for this group tonight
[42:21] and
[42:22] i'll be reading a lot of the scriptures
[42:25] and
[42:27] i can't go wrong with these scriptures
[42:29] i want to i want to read from matthew 9
[42:31] and 10 and i won't get there quite yet
[42:33] but matthew chapter 9 is one of the most
[42:36] powerful
[42:39] books most powerful chapters in this
[42:41] entire book
[42:43] and it is it is made up of a man
[42:46] jesus goes forth and he has a long day
[42:50] he has a long day preaching and praying
[42:53] for the people and
[42:55] and i want to
[42:56] go through these scriptures
[42:58] and um but first
[43:01] i want to say that that the ministry
[43:04] that this leads to that jesus leads to
[43:08] it's not necessarily
[43:10] a pastor in the pulpit and it's not
[43:13] necessarily an evangelist out there's
[43:16] each one of us have our own ministries
[43:18] and i want to do
[43:20] mention a friend of mine
[43:22] and i met this friend
[43:25] is probably in 2008.
[43:27] i was in the east african country of
[43:29] malawi
[43:30] and it is a poor
[43:33] very very poor country
[43:35] and uh i was
[43:37] going i was there on behalf of voice
[43:38] guide recordings
[43:40] and
[43:42] i met
[43:43] this uh the office manner introduced me
[43:45] to a man named john catali
[43:49] john
[43:50] came
[43:51] to me and and
[43:53] brother saeedy who's the office manager
[43:55] he said he wants to meet you meet
[43:57] somebody from the united states you know
[43:58] so
[43:59] i met
[44:00] i met john
[44:02] and john's first words to me
[44:07] was
[44:08] i'm not a pastor
[44:11] and
[44:12] he said he told me that he said my wife
[44:16] had a child
[44:18] from a previous relationship
[44:20] before we got married and this is before
[44:23] i ever learned
[44:25] about
[44:26] um the message and the bible and and
[44:29] what this is and he said
[44:32] he said but brother he says i feel as if
[44:34] i still have a ministry he says i don't
[44:36] believe that i could be called to be a
[44:37] pastor
[44:38] he says but i believe i still have a
[44:40] ministry
[44:42] and he started talking to me
[44:45] about
[44:46] what he had done
[44:48] and uh he um what he did is he took
[44:53] um
[44:54] i'll uh brother mark when i when i talk
[44:56] about i'm going to talk about a couple
[44:58] people and i'll refer back to them one
[45:00] one person i'll refer back to his name
[45:02] is william branham william branham was a
[45:05] he was a preacher that came along in the
[45:07] time of oral roberts and billy graham
[45:09] and back in the in the 1950s healing and
[45:12] charismatic revival in fact he's the one
[45:15] that started it
[45:16] so he he started he started this
[45:18] ministry and he changed the face of
[45:21] christianity and his message was come
[45:24] out of these denominations these
[45:26] denominations aren't going to get you
[45:28] anywhere all it is is a brand to
[45:30] separate yourself so
[45:32] he started this ministry
[45:35] and
[45:36] it did it
[45:37] shook the very foundations of
[45:39] christianity and it started a worldwide
[45:41] revival and and the other man that i
[45:44] that you'll find mentioned here a lot is
[45:46] a man named perry green
[45:48] and brother greene was a contemporary of
[45:51] brother branham he he learned um
[45:54] came up under brother brandman he's the
[45:56] one that started this church he was the
[45:58] original pastor of this church so just
[46:00] just a little background for you so when
[46:02] i when i refer back to them but there's
[46:04] john catali in africa
[46:07] he went and he started playing brother
[46:10] branham's recorded sermons
[46:12] to these to these uh natives
[46:16] and he started baptizing people
[46:19] not only was he baptizing people but
[46:23] miracles started following his ministry
[46:27] and he started telling me he told me
[46:28] this one story he says he says he went
[46:30] to this village he talked to the village
[46:32] head man
[46:34] and uh he said can i come in can i can i
[46:36] preach my message
[46:38] can i um play this
[46:40] short sermon that i have
[46:42] and uh and then
[46:44] can i i can pray for the sick or
[46:46] whatever the village head man says sure
[46:49] make yourself at home so he goes in and
[46:53] brother john preaches his message
[46:55] and then
[46:56] towards towards the end
[46:59] 14 people
[47:00] came to be baptized in this little
[47:02] village
[47:03] so john does the same thing the next day
[47:06] and another i wrote her down here i
[47:08] think it was 16 people another 16 people
[47:10] came to be baptized that day
[47:12] so the village head man comes to john
[47:16] and he says
[47:17] if what you're preaching is the truth
[47:21] my
[47:22] daughter
[47:24] is deaf
[47:25] and cannot speak
[47:27] he says if what you're preaching is the
[47:29] truth that jesus christ is today
[47:32] just like he was 2000 years ago here's
[47:34] my daughter
[47:36] so this young lady
[47:39] little girl walks up to john john lays
[47:41] his hands on her and he prays
[47:44] and then she starts hearing
[47:47] she's never heard before and she was
[47:49] born deaf
[47:50] she had never heard anything in her life
[47:53] and she obviously started hearing
[47:56] and
[47:57] brother john in the the crowd rejoiced
[47:59] and in the head man the
[48:00] dad rejoiced
[48:03] and uh brother john says wait
[48:07] he says she needs to speak
[48:10] and brother john says these these words
[48:13] he says where is the god of elijah
[48:16] laid his hands on the young lady again
[48:18] and she started speaking she didn't have
[48:21] to learn how to talk she started
[48:23] speaking the whole village gave their
[48:25] hearts to the lord jesus
[48:27] when i talked to john and this is about
[48:29] in 2008 he had already baptized 3
[48:33] 000
[48:34] people and he's on the field today doing
[48:36] the same thing i haven't talked to him
[48:37] in some time but do you see he may not
[48:40] have had a certain ministry that we see
[48:42] as normal which is maybe the pastor of a
[48:44] church but he still had had a ministry
[48:48] and anyone can go out
[48:51] and preach this gospel and win souls to
[48:53] christ preaching the gospel may not even
[48:56] be in word it may be indeed
[49:00] and that's that's
[49:02] what i would like to get to in our
[49:04] scriptures here
[49:06] in matthew chapter nine now the day
[49:08] started
[49:10] and this is a long day for our lord
[49:12] jesus
[49:14] the day started
[49:17] and uh we find out that that he was on a
[49:20] boat
[49:21] and he came in a ship across the sea of
[49:23] galilee now if you've ever been there
[49:25] it's not a real big it's not a big ocean
[49:27] it's just a fairly large lake
[49:30] and he comes across
[49:32] and we see
[49:34] this parallels in luke we see in luke
[49:37] that
[49:38] it
[49:40] he was
[49:41] preaching to all these people he was
[49:43] preaching to
[49:45] doctors of the law
[49:46] he was preaching to the pharisees
[49:49] and these men were not only from galilee
[49:51] which where he was where he was but they
[49:54] were also from all of judea and even
[49:56] jerusalem
[49:58] so these were important people that this
[50:00] fame of this young man had gone forth
[50:03] and they were listening to him and many
[50:05] of those people were not listening to
[50:07] him for the best reasons
[50:09] they were looking to criticize
[50:12] so they were
[50:14] they were they were as he was preaching
[50:16] there was a big crowd
[50:18] and in
[50:20] matthew chapter nine verses one through
[50:23] eight
[50:24] there was a man that had the palsy now
[50:26] the palsy is
[50:28] paralysis
[50:30] so
[50:31] and this crowd was so big and we see in
[50:32] the same story that's told in luke they
[50:34] lowered this man
[50:36] from the ceiling
[50:38] because the crowd was too great
[50:41] and and they get they get down
[50:45] to the lord jesus
[50:47] and
[50:49] the lord jesus
[50:51] healed the
[50:52] man but first let me read it matthew
[50:56] chapter 9
[50:58] verse 2 and behold they brought to him a
[51:01] man sick of the palsy laying on a bed
[51:04] and jesus seeing their faith said unto
[51:06] the sick of the palsy sun be of good
[51:07] cheer thy sins
[51:09] be forgiven me
[51:11] what a strange thing
[51:13] for
[51:15] this young man to say
[51:19] and behold
[51:20] certain of the scribes said within
[51:22] themselves this man blasphemeth
[51:24] and jesus
[51:26] knowing their hearts said what wherefore
[51:28] think he evil in your hearts
[51:30] for whether is it
[51:33] for whether is easier to say thy sins be
[51:36] forgiven thee or to say
[51:38] arise
[51:40] and walk
[51:42] jesus was saying a very simple thing
[51:44] there he says is it easier for me to say
[51:48] your sins are forgiven which is very
[51:49] easy
[51:51] anybody could say that
[51:53] or to say arise and walk
[51:55] and then we know what happened next
[51:57] then he said arise and walk
[52:00] and the man stood to his feet
[52:04] and then he departed his house
[52:07] and when the multitude sought they
[52:09] they glorified god
[52:12] and jesus went from that men from that
[52:15] place
[52:18] and
[52:19] he calls a man named matthew
[52:23] now
[52:25] matthew was a publican do you know what
[52:28] a publican is republican is a tax
[52:30] collector let me tell you how a tax
[52:33] collector made his living now we think
[52:35] he just collects taxes right
[52:37] the reason that they were hated so much
[52:39] is these tax collectors were jews
[52:42] and these tax collectors as they were
[52:44] collecting these taxes
[52:46] they would say okay
[52:49] jeremy
[52:50] you owe
[52:51] thousand dollars in taxes he looked on
[52:54] his ledger jeremy
[52:56] owes
[52:57] one thousand dollars in taxes
[53:00] okay jeremy that'll be fifteen hundred
[53:02] bucks
[53:04] it's like hey man
[53:05] i only owe a thousand no you owe fifteen
[53:08] hundred
[53:09] because i'm going to take the 500
[53:11] and i'm gonna pocket it
[53:13] no no no no you know
[53:15] it's it's a thousand it's 1500 i'm only
[53:17] going to give you a thousand okay roman
[53:19] guards go take his donkey
[53:21] and his ox because that's worth 500
[53:24] and it puts you out of business that's
[53:25] why this man was hated so much and
[53:27] that's what tax collectors did
[53:30] it was an absolute creep
[53:32] to the to the people
[53:33] to the jews and it was a jew selling out
[53:36] a jew working for rome
[53:38] and
[53:39] pocketing this money now this is a man
[53:41] that jesus calls
[53:43] all right so jesus passes by him and he
[53:46] says matthew he says come follow me
[53:50] so matthew gets up and matthew a child
[53:53] of god i don't care what you used to do
[53:55] i don't care how bad of a person you
[53:57] were a child of god stands up and
[54:00] follows the lord jesus and he goes so
[54:03] then
[54:04] we see what happens next is matthew
[54:06] invites
[54:07] these disciples over to his house
[54:11] all right now he probably had a really
[54:13] nice house because i assume he probably
[54:14] had a lot of money from what he was
[54:16] doing so he had this big house and he
[54:18] invited other tax collectors and he
[54:20] invited other
[54:22] people that were sinners
[54:25] what we would call sinners not the best
[54:27] people in the world
[54:29] he invites them
[54:32] and
[54:35] even
[54:35] let me read it here
[54:38] this is so important i think i think we
[54:40] should read it
[54:41] and when the pharisees saw it they said
[54:43] unto his disciples
[54:45] why edith your master with publicans and
[54:48] sinners
[54:49] but when jesus heard that he said to
[54:51] them they that be whole need not a
[54:53] physician but they that are sick
[54:55] but go ye and learn
[54:58] what that meaneth i will have mercy and
[55:00] not sacrifice
[55:03] for i am not come to call the righteous
[55:05] but the sinners to repentance
[55:08] this is pretty cool what jesus did that
[55:10] right there
[55:11] so so when we read the bible let's not
[55:14] just read it and go on to the next verse
[55:17] so what jesus said
[55:19] he says he tells these pharisees
[55:21] remember who he's talking to brother and
[55:22] he's talking to the the
[55:24] priests man the the big guys and he says
[55:27] this he says why don't you go and learn
[55:30] what this means and then he quotes a
[55:32] scripture
[55:34] and this scripture says i will have
[55:35] mercy and not sacrifice for i am not
[55:38] come to call the righteous to the
[55:40] sinners he was referring to a scripture
[55:42] in hosea hosea 6 6
[55:45] which says for i desired mercy and not
[55:47] sacrifice in the knowledge of god more
[55:49] than burnt offerings
[55:51] so i i thought that was a nice little
[55:53] dig
[55:54] that jesus you're so smart why don't you
[55:56] go and learn what the scriptures mean
[55:59] so then in verse 14
[56:02] he uh then came
[56:04] to him the disciple of john
[56:07] saying why do we and the pharisees fast
[56:09] often
[56:10] but thy disciples fast not
[56:16] let me read that again and i will put
[56:18] emphasis
[56:19] on on a name
[56:21] then came to him the disciples of john
[56:25] john the baptist
[56:28] saying why do we and the pharisees fast
[56:31] off but that thy disciples
[56:36] fast not
[56:38] what
[56:39] you think about that question who's who
[56:41] are these disciples
[56:43] they're the prophet of malachi 3 and the
[56:45] prophet of malachi 4 to turn the heart
[56:48] of the fathers to the children
[56:51] these are these are his disciples
[56:54] and they're coming to the lord jesus the
[56:56] one that he had already introduced on
[56:57] the jordan river
[56:59] when he said remember brother aaron he
[57:00] said behold the lamb of god that takes
[57:02] away the sins of the world
[57:04] they i'm sure they were there
[57:06] but oh john john yeah john we believe
[57:08] you we believe you john we'll just stick
[57:10] with what you say you know we'll just
[57:11] stick with you john john introduce them
[57:14] to the lord jesus
[57:15] and this this
[57:17] strange
[57:18] anomaly in the scripture
[57:21] is all over the place
[57:24] so he says this
[57:26] why do we
[57:27] fast
[57:29] and the pharisees fast
[57:31] but your disciples don't fast
[57:34] jesus said can the children of the bride
[57:35] chamber mourn as long as the bridegroom
[57:38] is with them but the days will come when
[57:40] the bridegroom shall be taken from them
[57:41] and then they shall fast
[57:44] now
[57:45] we see
[57:46] friends and i know all of you see it
[57:49] we've heard
[57:50] all these different interpretations
[57:54] and everything from the third poll to
[57:56] the return ministry to the tent meeting
[57:58] to the gospel going to the jews to the
[58:00] seven thunders and and all these
[58:02] different
[58:03] interpretations we've we've heard that
[58:05] have done nothing but separate the
[58:07] people that have done they have not
[58:09] resulted in anything
[58:11] but division
[58:13] and i hate that i just can't stand it it
[58:15] tears it tears my heart out of me to
[58:18] think of what has happened all these
[58:19] years and the division between the
[58:21] churches
[58:23] and we see that
[58:25] right there
[58:26] in john the baptist disciples and
[58:28] they're saying hey you're not doing
[58:30] things like us you're not having church
[58:32] like we think you should have church
[58:34] you're not doing things you're not
[58:35] dressing like you we think you should
[58:37] dress you're not you're not
[58:39] conforming to our image of what
[58:43] i'll say christianity is
[58:46] and you know what jesus says jesus
[58:48] answers this and he gives them an
[58:51] amazing
[58:52] answer
[58:54] he says this
[59:00] he says
[59:01] no man puts a piece put it the piece of
[59:04] new cloth under an old garment for that
[59:06] which is put into
[59:08] it that for that which is put in to fill
[59:12] it up
[59:13] and to fill it up taketh from the
[59:15] garment and is rent and made worse so
[59:17] what he's saying is
[59:19] sister marilyn you're a seamstress when
[59:21] you when you patch
[59:22] a garment if you have an old pair of
[59:24] pants
[59:25] and you put this brand new
[59:28] piece of denim in there
[59:30] that brand new piece of denim will
[59:32] shrink
[59:33] and you have this old these old pants
[59:36] and it'll shrink and it'll rip right
[59:38] around
[59:40] right on the seam because you have
[59:43] it it can't it can't stretch like like
[59:46] the the garment that can shrink and then
[59:48] he then he talks about and he says and
[59:49] then you put
[59:51] new
[59:52] wine
[59:53] in old wineskins then these bottles
[59:56] these wine bottles before they weren't
[59:57] made of glass they were made of of skins
[1:00:00] and you you they they get hard and old
[1:00:03] and then so that wine when you put it in
[1:00:05] there ferments and it degasses
[1:00:07] and it swells
[1:00:10] and if it swells in something that can't
[1:00:13] move it'll break
[1:00:15] and
[1:00:17] jesus isn't just telling a story here
[1:00:19] he's like you disciples of the prophet
[1:00:22] you believe the message of the hour
[1:00:25] you gotta
[1:00:27] swell a little bit
[1:00:29] you gotta move a little bit you can't be
[1:00:31] so hard and rigid
[1:00:34] because number one this ain't what john
[1:00:36] taught
[1:00:37] but number two this is not according to
[1:00:40] the law according to the lord
[1:00:42] and i hope that i can bring that right
[1:00:44] down to us
[1:00:45] we have to be able to swell and move a
[1:00:49] little bit with our doctrines we can't
[1:00:51] we can't be so rigid and say it's got to
[1:00:53] be this way and we put god in a box and
[1:00:55] you know what we do when we put god in a
[1:00:56] box
[1:00:57] we cast them out
[1:00:59] yeah
[1:01:02] so he gives us this beautiful analogy
[1:01:04] there and let's let's keep going here
[1:01:07] and uh brother lyle just texted me said
[1:01:08] amen love you brother lyle god bless you
[1:01:12] um
[1:01:14] he says and while he spake these things
[1:01:16] unto them there came a certain ruler
[1:01:18] worshiping him
[1:01:20] saying my god my daughter
[1:01:22] is even now dead but come and lay their
[1:01:25] hand upon her and she shall live that
[1:01:26] man's name is jairus we know from the
[1:01:28] book of mark tells the same story he was
[1:01:31] a ruler and he asked the lord jesus to
[1:01:34] come
[1:01:34] jesus arose followed him
[1:01:37] took his disciples with him and while he
[1:01:39] was on the road
[1:01:41] to jairus house now this is developing
[1:01:43] into a big day
[1:01:45] while he was on the road to jairus house
[1:01:50] there was a young lady that had a blood
[1:01:53] issue for many many years
[1:01:56] and
[1:01:57] she had it in her heart
[1:01:59] this man is so special he is so special
[1:02:03] if i can just if i can just touch his
[1:02:06] garment
[1:02:07] then i will be healed so as jesus is as
[1:02:10] he's walking by
[1:02:13] she comes up behind him
[1:02:17] and she just
[1:02:18] touches his garment it's probably his
[1:02:20] his cloak or or something that hung
[1:02:22] loose
[1:02:24] and she touched it she was immediately
[1:02:26] healed
[1:02:27] she was immediately the blood dried up
[1:02:29] right then
[1:02:30] jesus turned around and you know the
[1:02:32] story jesus turns around and he says
[1:02:34] this he says virtue has gone from me
[1:02:39] and
[1:02:40] she knew she was caught
[1:02:42] and then we have the dialogue between
[1:02:44] the two it doesn't say in the book of
[1:02:46] matthew but it does in other gospels
[1:02:49] especially in luke it says that jesus
[1:02:51] said virtue has gone from me
[1:02:54] now my point in saying that and spending
[1:02:56] this time
[1:02:58] and saying that
[1:03:00] is
[1:03:01] that virtue which is strength
[1:03:04] that came from
[1:03:07] jesus
[1:03:08] it left him
[1:03:10] and went into
[1:03:13] this lady
[1:03:14] and healed her and i ask you
[1:03:18] and i believe it's first peter
[1:03:20] chapter one or chapter two maybe it's
[1:03:23] second peter chapter one or chapter two
[1:03:25] we know the statue of a perfect man
[1:03:28] add to your faith virtue
[1:03:30] virtue knowledge on its temperature and
[1:03:32] then it goes up
[1:03:33] so
[1:03:36] this
[1:03:36] virtue that jesus had
[1:03:39] he had to have it
[1:03:42] he had to have it in the first place
[1:03:44] to give it out
[1:03:46] and friends we need it
[1:03:48] if we are going to be
[1:03:51] this bride of christ
[1:03:53] this
[1:03:54] church
[1:03:55] this chosen this elect of god
[1:03:58] we have to have that virtue brother
[1:04:01] we've got to have it or we don't we
[1:04:03] won't be able to give it out
[1:04:05] you have to possess something to give it
[1:04:07] and how do we get that virtue there's
[1:04:09] one time that
[1:04:11] i don't know where it is in the gospels
[1:04:13] but there was one time that they brought
[1:04:15] to jesus and this is after
[1:04:18] this chapter 10 they brought to jesus
[1:04:22] a
[1:04:23] boy
[1:04:24] that was epileptic
[1:04:27] and they brought it to him and and this
[1:04:28] is what they said to jesus they said
[1:04:30] your disciples could not heal
[1:04:33] this per this boy
[1:04:35] so they brought it to him and jesus's
[1:04:37] answer was jesus you have little faith
[1:04:40] he said how long am i going to be with
[1:04:41] you
[1:04:43] so then
[1:04:44] he casts out the demon
[1:04:46] the boy's healed
[1:04:48] and he gets up and he walks away and his
[1:04:50] disciples a little bit later they're
[1:04:51] like lord
[1:04:52] you and let's steal here how come we
[1:04:54] couldn't do that
[1:04:56] and jesus says this
[1:04:58] he says this kind only goes out through
[1:05:01] prayer and fasting this is the son of
[1:05:03] god
[1:05:04] that was speaking
[1:05:06] jesus
[1:05:08] he said i pray i fast there's one place
[1:05:12] that jesus prayed all night the son of
[1:05:15] god prayed all night imagine how much we
[1:05:18] have to pray
[1:05:20] so jesus sets the example he says this
[1:05:21] kind only goes out through prayer and
[1:05:23] fasting so we see
[1:05:26] on the way to jairus's house
[1:05:28] this woman with the blood issue touched
[1:05:30] him
[1:05:31] strength went out from jesus and healed
[1:05:33] her so now
[1:05:34] remember he's starting to get tired
[1:05:36] maybe
[1:05:37] so now he gets to jairus's house
[1:05:40] to verse 19.
[1:05:46] uh okay alrighty let's go to verse 22.
[1:05:53] but jesus turned about him
[1:05:55] and and then
[1:05:56] that's that's the um the sister that was
[1:05:59] healed verse 23 and when jesus came to
[1:06:01] the ruler's house and he saw the
[1:06:02] minstrels and the people making a noise
[1:06:05] he said unto them give place for the
[1:06:08] maid is not dead but sleepeth and they
[1:06:11] laughed him to scorn
[1:06:13] now jesus walks in and
[1:06:16] and they start picking at him and you
[1:06:18] know what he says he says get out of my
[1:06:20] way he says get out of here i got
[1:06:22] something to do
[1:06:23] so he walks in there and and this is at
[1:06:26] least three times in the gospels get out
[1:06:28] of my way
[1:06:30] he walks in there he was on a mission
[1:06:33] jairus daughter of course he raised her
[1:06:36] up
[1:06:37] from the dead
[1:06:38] the power of god once again
[1:06:41] picking at him though have you um
[1:06:43] there's a i remember when i was
[1:06:45] a few years ago
[1:06:46] i was i was watching
[1:06:49] a golden eagle
[1:06:50] through binoculars
[1:06:52] and some of you outdoorsman heath i know
[1:06:54] you love the outdoors like i do
[1:06:56] and
[1:06:58] every time just about every time you see
[1:07:00] an eagle
[1:07:01] when has anybody seen it i know you have
[1:07:03] you've probably seen lots of them when
[1:07:05] you when you see an eagle especially
[1:07:06] here in southern arizona or in arizona
[1:07:09] these eagles are flying they're big
[1:07:10] giant birds and there's always some
[1:07:12] little bird picking at him you ever see
[1:07:14] them doing that
[1:07:15] and they're dive bombing dive bombing
[1:07:17] them and these eagles are just going
[1:07:19] along their way and i was i was watching
[1:07:22] this golden eagle through the binoculars
[1:07:25] and and he was flying along and there
[1:07:28] was this little hawk and this hawk was
[1:07:30] pestering him
[1:07:32] down and up and down in and this poor
[1:07:34] eagle you know he's probably like man
[1:07:36] will you leave me alone i just want to
[1:07:37] catch a rabbit i'm not i don't want to
[1:07:39] mess with you
[1:07:40] but but this thing is just pecking at
[1:07:42] him and die vomiting and then
[1:07:45] that eagle
[1:07:47] turned over on his back
[1:07:50] stuck out those claws
[1:07:53] and opened his beak man it was like an
[1:07:55] f-22 raptor fighter jet man he flipped
[1:07:59] over there and
[1:08:01] that
[1:08:02] i mean if that hawk would have got close
[1:08:04] had been like a meat grinder you know
[1:08:06] but he
[1:08:08] swerved off and then came right back the
[1:08:10] eagle turned over and just started going
[1:08:11] didn't do him any good
[1:08:13] didn't do that eagle any good at all to
[1:08:16] show him his goods to show him his
[1:08:18] business and
[1:08:19] that hawk just kept on pestering him and
[1:08:21] kept on going finally the eagle just
[1:08:23] kept going flying and the hawk gave up
[1:08:27] and here we see jesus doing the same
[1:08:29] thing and i think as christians
[1:08:31] a lot of times it happens to us
[1:08:33] we're trying to do something right and
[1:08:35] the devil is always picking us picking
[1:08:37] on us i believe paul it was that said
[1:08:40] that when i would do good evil is
[1:08:43] present with me and can you testify to
[1:08:46] that when we're trying to do something
[1:08:48] right we're always getting picked at and
[1:08:51] but continue on and jesus jesus did that
[1:08:54] here
[1:08:55] so let's continue on nobody's picking at
[1:08:57] me thank god
[1:08:58] um
[1:09:00] and then
[1:09:01] jesus jesus had healed jairus daughter
[1:09:04] and the fame went about and then
[1:09:06] and when jesus departed that house verse
[1:09:09] 27
[1:09:11] two blind men followed him
[1:09:13] crying and saying thou son of david have
[1:09:15] mercy on us
[1:09:17] and when he was coming to the house the
[1:09:19] blind man came in and jesus saith unto
[1:09:23] them
[1:09:24] he's getting tired
[1:09:26] it's a long day brother aaron
[1:09:29] he's getting tired and i so love his
[1:09:32] words brother you can put it up there
[1:09:34] i so love the words that jesus said
[1:09:37] these two blind men come in
[1:09:40] and he says this he said
[1:09:42] believe ye
[1:09:44] that i am able to do this
[1:09:47] what a wonderful statement and friends i
[1:09:50] ask you whatever you have need of
[1:09:54] do you believe that he is able to do it
[1:09:57] oh i just
[1:09:58] it was just precious to me i could feel
[1:10:01] jesus
[1:10:02] and he looked and remember he's 30 years
[1:10:04] old he's a young man
[1:10:06] he says do you believe i'm able
[1:10:08] to do this do you really believe
[1:10:11] and they said yay
[1:10:12] we believe yes
[1:10:14] we believe
[1:10:17] they were healed
[1:10:18] right there
[1:10:19] and when they departed
[1:10:22] fame spread about the country
[1:10:26] verse 32 and as they went out they
[1:10:28] brought to him a dumb man possessed with
[1:10:30] the devil a man that couldn't speak
[1:10:32] possessed with the devil
[1:10:33] and when the devil was cast out the dumb
[1:10:36] spake remember my story about brother
[1:10:37] john at the beginning
[1:10:39] same holy spirit that was with our lord
[1:10:41] jesus right here
[1:10:42] and the multitudes marveled but the
[1:10:44] pharisees said he casteth out devils
[1:10:47] through the prince of devils
[1:10:49] you know
[1:10:50] i'm sure he got sick of it flying along
[1:10:54] but he just continued on the way he was
[1:10:56] going
[1:10:59] and jesus
[1:11:01] went about all the cities and villages
[1:11:03] teaching in their synagogues and
[1:11:04] preaching the gospel of the kingdom and
[1:11:06] healing every sickness and every disease
[1:11:09] among the
[1:11:10] the people
[1:11:11] now friends this is
[1:11:13] the point
[1:11:14] that i wanted to make
[1:11:16] now when jesus was here
[1:11:19] we we hear so much about ephesians
[1:11:22] chapter 4
[1:11:23] in the fivefold ministry
[1:11:26] now that fivefold ministry
[1:11:29] is for the perfecting of the body
[1:11:32] of what
[1:11:34] christ
[1:11:34] the body of christ
[1:11:37] so
[1:11:38] jesus
[1:11:39] and him only
[1:11:41] exemplified the entire five-fold
[1:11:44] ministry
[1:11:46] because it was his body
[1:11:48] so we look
[1:11:51] in ephesians 4 12 says it's for the
[1:11:53] perfecting of the saints for the work of
[1:11:55] the ministry for the edifying of the
[1:11:57] body and we see that jesus acted as an
[1:12:01] apostle
[1:12:02] many many times but he acted as an
[1:12:04] apostle matthew 23 when he said woe unto
[1:12:06] you scribes and pharisee hypocrites and
[1:12:08] he corrected these pastors these
[1:12:11] ministers he corrected them
[1:12:14] doing the work of an apostle
[1:12:16] then we see in a pr the work of a of a
[1:12:18] prophet
[1:12:20] in matthew 24 when jesus said
[1:12:23] that verily i say unto you that there
[1:12:25] now there shall not be left here one
[1:12:27] stone upon the other that shall not be
[1:12:30] thrown down
[1:12:31] that's the temple he was prophesying he
[1:12:34] was acting in the office of a prophet he
[1:12:36] was prophesying and then 80 70 we see i
[1:12:40] believe it was uh what was his name
[1:12:41] titus the emperor titus came down
[1:12:44] destroyed the temple
[1:12:45] big piles of stone everywhere
[1:12:50] he was an evangelist
[1:12:51] when he met the woman at the well the
[1:12:53] samaritan woman he was an evangelist
[1:12:55] when he as i just said when he called
[1:12:56] matthew
[1:12:58] from from his tax collecting booth
[1:13:02] and he was a teacher
[1:13:04] in most of his ministry
[1:13:06] jesus's most of his ministry was in the
[1:13:09] teaching realm bringing this new
[1:13:12] gospel
[1:13:14] this new way of thinking saying
[1:13:17] if somebody smacks you on the cheek turn
[1:13:19] the other cheek and let them smack the
[1:13:21] other side that's odd that was never
[1:13:23] preached for 4 000 years no what you do
[1:13:25] is you cut their hand off or there's an
[1:13:26] eye for an eye or you know this and then
[1:13:29] evangelism started and so jesus brings
[1:13:32] this strange
[1:13:34] new
[1:13:34] doctrine
[1:13:36] through teaching of loving your enemies
[1:13:40] you killed your enemies in the old
[1:13:41] testament
[1:13:43] but you love your enemies now
[1:13:47] but here
[1:13:49] the tired young man
[1:13:52] that jesus was
[1:13:56] he
[1:13:57] had the office of a pastor right now
[1:14:00] we're looking and jesus was tired
[1:14:03] he sat he he maybe had sat down it's a
[1:14:07] long day he had been picked out all day
[1:14:09] he'd been preaching he'd been healing
[1:14:11] the sick strength was coming out of him
[1:14:13] and this is all one day
[1:14:16] he was tired and there was still so much
[1:14:19] to do
[1:14:20] i remember
[1:14:21] a book of hebrews
[1:14:23] it says that he was not a high priest
[1:14:25] that could not be touched with the
[1:14:26] feeling of our infirmities but he was in
[1:14:29] all points tempted
[1:14:31] as we are yet
[1:14:32] without sin
[1:14:34] so every problem that we have
[1:14:36] jesus felt it
[1:14:38] he knew how it was to feel he knew how
[1:14:40] it was to be tempted by sin yet he
[1:14:44] overcame it makes him far greater if he
[1:14:48] would have been an angel he'd be like
[1:14:49] well you never you never had that desire
[1:14:51] jesus but he did
[1:14:53] he was a man and yet he overcame and he
[1:14:56] was there and he was tired and he looked
[1:14:58] upon
[1:14:59] all out here he looked out
[1:15:02] and he said this but when he saw the
[1:15:04] multitudes
[1:15:06] he was moved with compassion on them
[1:15:08] because they fainted and were scattered
[1:15:11] abroad as sheep having no shepherd
[1:15:14] then saith he's to his disciples the
[1:15:17] harvest truly is plenteous
[1:15:20] but the laborers are few
[1:15:23] now watch the office of a pastor
[1:15:27] pray ye therefore
[1:15:29] the lord of the harvest he's asking for
[1:15:32] prayer
[1:15:34] pray ye
[1:15:35] therefore the lord of the harvest that
[1:15:37] he will send for his laborers
[1:15:40] into
[1:15:41] his harvest
[1:15:43] i feel so bad for him
[1:15:45] he was there
[1:15:47] and he was he was looking out and he was
[1:15:48] seeing all these sick people
[1:15:51] and he had healed probably hundreds in
[1:15:52] that day
[1:15:54] and he was seeing all these people that
[1:15:55] were lost
[1:15:56] and there's all these people throughout
[1:15:58] tucson
[1:15:59] let's say there's all these people that
[1:16:01] have left this very church
[1:16:04] and he looks out upon this and he says
[1:16:06] pray
[1:16:07] that the lord will send laborers to help
[1:16:10] them i'm just one man
[1:16:12] i can't do it all by myself
[1:16:15] pray for these people
[1:16:17] but then something happens the day of
[1:16:19] pentecost
[1:16:21] and that spirit of that one man went
[1:16:23] into many 120 in one shot
[1:16:26] but do you see that spirit
[1:16:29] that burden that he had for the people
[1:16:33] and i don't have time but i would like
[1:16:35] to um
[1:16:36] i would like to read
[1:16:39] um through matthew chapter 10 but again
[1:16:41] i'm sorry i i don't have time but um
[1:16:45] what happened in matthew chapter 10
[1:16:48] was jesus
[1:16:50] takes his disciples
[1:16:54] and he sends them
[1:16:56] out
[1:16:57] and he says this in in matthew 10 5 he
[1:17:00] says this he says go not into the way of
[1:17:03] the gentiles and into any city of the
[1:17:06] samaritans energy not
[1:17:08] so what he's saying here he's like that
[1:17:10] time's going to come
[1:17:11] and we know that that time did come in
[1:17:13] the book of acts
[1:17:14] but he says but first
[1:17:17] go just
[1:17:19] our people
[1:17:20] just
[1:17:21] to
[1:17:23] maybe the tabernacle
[1:17:24] just to our families just to our group
[1:17:28] let's just go out to them first
[1:17:31] and then later on he says he says yeah
[1:17:33] and he says and if you bring your gift
[1:17:35] into this church or if you bring your
[1:17:37] gift into this house and they don't
[1:17:39] accept you
[1:17:41] he said
[1:17:42] shake your garment wipe your shoes
[1:17:45] and take your gift with you
[1:17:48] if these people refuse that gift that
[1:17:50] comes into the church we don't want you
[1:17:52] we want god that's in our box we want we
[1:17:54] want things this way and this is the way
[1:17:56] a church should be run this is the way a
[1:17:58] home should be run this is the way
[1:17:59] christianity should be
[1:18:01] we don't want you
[1:18:04] jesus said go
[1:18:07] and then and then he says
[1:18:09] to the disciples and you know they were
[1:18:11] thinking well nobody's going to accept
[1:18:14] us
[1:18:15] now what do we do and he's like listen i
[1:18:17] promise you
[1:18:18] there's plenty of work to be done you're
[1:18:22] not going to finish it before the holy
[1:18:24] spirit comes
[1:18:25] but now get on your horse and ride get
[1:18:28] going
[1:18:29] do do these things
[1:18:32] and then they did and jesus jesus is
[1:18:35] instructing them and it comes to the
[1:18:37] close of my sermon here
[1:18:42] and
[1:18:43] the sister on the piano
[1:18:44] you can come
[1:18:46] and brother um
[1:18:47] it'll be
[1:18:49] aaron but
[1:18:51] towards the end of matthew
[1:18:54] chapter 10
[1:19:00] verse 41
[1:19:02] and jesus is instructing
[1:19:04] these disciples to go out
[1:19:07] to heal the sick to cast out devils to
[1:19:09] preach the gospel to bring these sinners
[1:19:12] to christ
[1:19:14] and he says this
[1:19:17] he makes this statement
[1:19:20] matthew 10 41 he said he that receives a
[1:19:23] prophet in the name of a prophet shall
[1:19:25] receive a prophet's reward and he that
[1:19:27] receiveth the righteous man in the name
[1:19:29] of a righteous man shall receive a
[1:19:32] righteous man's reward
[1:19:35] now if we brother if you put up that
[1:19:37] quote
[1:19:39] from brother branham
[1:19:42] somebody asked brother branham about
[1:19:45] that
[1:19:46] scripture
[1:19:48] they said this
[1:19:49] they said brother branham if you have
[1:19:51] time please explain matthew 10 41 i
[1:19:53] would like to know what is the prophet's
[1:19:55] reward
[1:19:58] and brother braham says well now jesus
[1:20:00] said whosoever received the prophet the
[1:20:01] name of a prophet shall receive a
[1:20:02] prophetic reward a prophet's reward is
[1:20:05] to be a friend
[1:20:07] with the prophet
[1:20:09] whosoever receives the righteous man in
[1:20:11] the name of righteous man receives a
[1:20:13] righteous man's reward
[1:20:16] and
[1:20:16] and he says he goes on and he says
[1:20:19] and if
[1:20:20] they want to know what a prophet's
[1:20:22] reward is is to be a friend of a prophet
[1:20:24] that's a reward he's your friend like
[1:20:26] the shunamite woman
[1:20:28] remember elisha
[1:20:30] like the shunamite woman it might come
[1:20:31] in handy sometime and it did with her
[1:20:35] see watch god's servants
[1:20:36] now
[1:20:39] my dad passed away

[1:21:04] and
[1:21:06] i think it was my brother jeremy
[1:21:08] suggested matthew 10 41.
[1:21:12] and i was sitting back and i was kind of
[1:21:14] rejoicing over that brother aaron i was
[1:21:15] thinking you know my dad was close with
[1:21:17] brother branham you know he was my
[1:21:19] grandpa was
[1:21:21] if it wasn't his closest friend it was
[1:21:22] one of the top couple
[1:21:24] uh closest friends that brother brandon
[1:21:26] had and i was just i was just kind of
[1:21:27] rejoicing

[1:21:31] with that man that as great as he was
[1:21:35] my dad was his friend
[1:21:37] and and it made me i was just feeling
[1:21:39] good and then
[1:21:41] something seemed to
[1:21:43] say to me

[1:21:46] scripture
[1:21:49] and i would present it to all of us come

[1:25:25] permission to do what i'm gonna do
[1:25:27] he shared some things with me and
[1:25:29] in the change that he's gone through
[1:25:32] from where he is
[1:25:34] to where he is now
[1:25:36] there are people that are going after
[1:25:38] him
[1:25:40] they're just they just pick at us
[1:25:43] okay
[1:25:44] they're texting him they're calling him
[1:25:46] and they're
[1:25:48] saying how could you do this how could
[1:25:50] you go to the other side
[1:25:52] and he shared his heart because he feels
[1:25:54] god has done this so
[1:25:56] as a congregation i want us just to pray
[1:25:59] because it's it's
[1:26:01] he's well known
[1:26:03] it's a name that is known
[1:26:05] and i think we could we could bear each
[1:26:07] other's burden this way so that's just
[1:26:09] our hands
[1:26:10] lord it's
[1:26:12] my brother daniel
[1:26:13] shared his heart
[1:26:15] [Music]
[1:26:16] didn't anyway stand up here and say look
[1:26:18] at me what i am but rather who we are
[1:26:23] we're all part of the body of christ
[1:26:24] lord and
[1:26:26] satan would like to come and
[1:26:28] and and destroy
[1:26:30] the confidence in what god is doing
[1:26:33] what you're doing through our brother
[1:26:34] daniel in people when they see that and
[1:26:38] they would they would be critical they
[1:26:39] would be
[1:26:41] saying damaging things and it hurts as a
[1:26:44] human to hear these things
[1:26:46] so lord we ask you to give them grace
[1:26:48] and strength
[1:26:50] and to follow that leadership they're
[1:26:52] calling in his life to do what you want
[1:26:54] him to do
[1:26:55] [Music]
[1:26:56] even as you cried out over jerusalem as
[1:26:59] you said there you said oh jerusalem oh
[1:27:01] jerusalem how oft would i have gathered
[1:27:04] you
[1:27:04] it hurts you
[1:27:06] and it hurts us too lord so strengthen
[1:27:08] our brother
[1:27:10] his wife his family lord and
[1:27:13] even his his brothers and sisters who
[1:27:15] may at this time not understand but may
[1:27:17] the love of god go through all of them
[1:27:20] because that's what it takes in all of
[1:27:21] us lord
[1:27:23] so as a congregation lord we ask that
[1:27:25] you would do that for our brother daniel
[1:27:27] lord
[1:27:28] and may the peace of god just rest with
[1:27:30] him is our prayer lord
[1:27:32] we ask you in jesus christ's name
[1:27:34] amen god bless you
[1:27:36] thank you
[1:27:40] [Music]
[1:27:58] shine all around
[1:28:05] [Music]
[1:28:07] jesus
[1:28:12] [Music]
[1:28:16] it takes courage to stand
[1:28:18] and do what brother daniel's been doing
[1:28:21] but he shared his heart with us and he
[1:28:23] says i just
[1:28:24] i love the people
[1:28:26] and i'm tired of seeing the divisions
[1:28:28] and the breaks and
[1:28:29] this that the other we all we all we
[1:28:31] would love to
[1:28:33] because you know when when your body
[1:28:35] begins to fight against each other what
[1:28:37] happens to you you get sick
[1:28:38] you hurt you fall apart
[1:28:41] but when the body is working in unity
[1:28:43] every part doing its part there's
[1:28:44] strength in it and also let's let's just
[1:28:47] do that together so
[1:28:50] it's just a couple of reminders
[1:28:54] this weekend brother joe adams and his
[1:28:56] wife i don't know if any of the children
[1:28:57] are coming but
