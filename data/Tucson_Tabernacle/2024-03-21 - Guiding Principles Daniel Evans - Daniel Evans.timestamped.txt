[39:54] want you to come please and as I said
[39:55] especially the dads there's some things
[39:58] on my heart that I want to talk with the

[40:25] questions and that's this coming Friday
[40:28] at seven o'clock and we'll meet upstairs
[40:32] in the in the chapel upstairs
[40:35] right
[40:37] I am
[40:39] I was on a
[40:40] trip this past week
[40:43] and um
[40:45] it was uh it was a good it was a good
[40:47] trip I was
[40:49] going back we had a like a leadership
[40:51] conference leadership seminar that I had
[40:54] to go to and I hate to miss
[40:56] and I think that my post of Duty's here
[40:59] and
[41:00] and uh but I had to go and I believe it
[41:03] was the Lord's will that I went because
[41:06] when we were there it gave me a more
[41:08] time to pray and I'd come back home to a
[41:11] to a hotel room by myself in the
[41:14] evenings and and had a little bit of a
[41:15] little bit more quiet time maybe than I
[41:17] usually have
[41:18] and
[41:20] learn to share something that was part
[41:23] of this leadership seminar that that
[41:25] many of the brothers and and sisters
[41:27] have maybe have have attended these
[41:29] types of seminars and they talk about
[41:34] um certain things that makes the company
[41:36] better in my case the USGS the the
[41:39] Bureau of the the government that I work
[41:41] for
[41:42] um and they have what's called guiding
[41:46] principles
[41:48] and these guiding principles
[41:50] are what steers your path
[41:55] as a bureau or or as a company and these
[41:59] guiding principles aren't necessarily
[42:01] they're not at all they're not the end
[42:03] goal
[42:04] but what they are is they keep you on
[42:06] track
[42:07] they're like guard rails or bumpers on
[42:10] the edge where you're you're moving in a
[42:12] in a certain direction and and you start
[42:14] to maybe Veer off and these guiding
[42:17] principles will help you get back on the
[42:19] path so that you can you can get to the
[42:22] goal of the organization
[42:25] and of course I work for a
[42:27] scientific organization and and
[42:31] our goals ultimately is to provide the
[42:35] best science and to make changes in the
[42:38] world and and
[42:39] that direction but these guiding
[42:41] principles
[42:42] point us
[42:44] to that ultimate goal and as I said it's
[42:47] very important he's got any principles
[42:49] aren't our ultimate goal
[42:51] but they steer Us in that direction
[42:55] and that's
[42:57] what I wanted to talk about today the
[42:59] title of my sermon is is guiding
[43:01] principles
[43:03] so I went to this seminar and I was I
[43:06] was thinking about these things during
[43:08] the week and got on the plane and uh
[43:13] went went to the back went to my seat
[43:15] and um see there's a fella there
[43:19] and um I I took my seat and then another
[43:22] guy came and and the guy that was
[43:24] already there he was in the wrong seat
[43:26] so the one asked the other one to move
[43:28] and and a little bit abrupt but uh the
[43:33] one wanted to sit next to the window but
[43:34] his his seat was in the middle and
[43:36] another guy he wanted to be at the
[43:38] window and his ticket said that he got
[43:39] to sit on the window so yeah just a few
[43:42] words and then the guy that had to
[43:44] the middle seat he went to the middle
[43:46] seat
[43:47] so we sat down
[43:50] and uh the the stewardess came and the
[43:53] doors weren't even closed yet of the
[43:55] airplane and she came walking walking by
[43:58] to get to the front of the airplane and
[44:00] he says he says excuse me he says can I
[44:02] get some water
[44:04] and uh
[44:06] and she says yeah you know okay I'm busy
[44:09] but so she went and got him a bottle of
[44:10] water and he didn't even drink it he put
[44:12] it in a seat pocket
[44:14] and I thought okay
[44:17] so
[44:18] then then as we're going
[44:20] we take off and and we're going along
[44:23] and and they come with the carts you
[44:25] know how they do and and she comes up
[44:27] and she says to me she says what would
[44:29] you like to drink and I I got my
[44:30] drinking and uh a snack and uh then the
[44:34] guy next to me he says he says well I
[44:37] would like to have
[44:38] ginger ale
[44:40] and she says okay and he says and orange
[44:43] juice
[44:44] I was like oh he's he's uh he's he's
[44:47] going after it so so then she gives him
[44:51] his ginger ale and his orange juice and
[44:52] the guy next to him he says I want
[44:54] orange juice too and I want a Coke
[44:57] I said okay
[44:59] so I'm I'm watching this whole thing
[45:01] unfold and and she takes she says what
[45:03] kind of a snack do you want you have you
[45:04] can get a cookie or pretzels or nuts or
[45:07] something and he says I want all of them
[45:11] and I'm looking at this guy and she gave
[45:14] it to him
[45:15] so I was thinking
[45:19] what if
[45:20] everybody had the same attitude that
[45:23] this guy had
[45:25] and I was thinking she would never get
[45:27] that cart a third of the way through the
[45:30] through the congregation
[45:32] and and then he's sitting there and he
[45:35] has he has all of his stuff and he
[45:37] spills his his spills his ginger ale all
[45:39] over the place but uh that didn't have
[45:41] anything to do with the story yet but I
[45:43] kind of served him right but uh so he
[45:46] only got the orange juice so then we're
[45:48] going along and he presses the button
[45:51] and he leans back
[45:53] in in the sea I don't know why they put
[45:56] those those seats on airplanes because
[45:58] it just collapses the back the back uh
[46:02] seat that's right behind you
[46:05] so he does that and he's the guys all
[46:08] over the place and it was like this
[46:10] whole flight
[46:11] was just there just to serve him
[46:15] and again I thought what if the whole
[46:17] what if all of the the airline what if
[46:20] the whole congregation here thought like
[46:22] this man did is I'm here for you to
[46:25] serve me
[46:26] and I thought as we were going and I'm
[46:28] and I'm I'm taking my notes I have my
[46:31] laptop out and I'm working on the sermon
[46:33] and I'm writing down everything this
[46:35] guy's doing
[46:37] and
[46:39] and I was thinking what are his guiding
[46:43] principles in life
[46:46] what's this man like outside of this
[46:49] airplane and and I don't want to condemn
[46:51] I don't want to judge the man he may be
[46:53] a perfectly good person but his
[46:55] impression on to me
[46:57] was that he was in this life
[47:00] to be served
[47:02] and his guiding principles what guided
[47:05] him through life is how much he could
[47:07] get from any situation
[47:12] he's sitting there and and I'm typing
[47:15] away and the guy is just all spread out
[47:18] and I'm over in the aisle and I'm I'm
[47:20] typing
[47:22] and and I was I was thinking how many of
[47:25] us
[47:27] might
[47:28] act like this man does
[47:33] and these guiding principles Maybe
[47:38] that are these guiding principles in our
[47:41] lives what steers us through
[47:44] are they to serve ourselves
[47:48] or do we have a goal at the end that's
[47:51] so important that these guiding
[47:53] principles are set to keep us on that
[47:56] road of Excellence
[47:58] as as the seminar said
[48:01] on this road that we will eventually
[48:03] reach that ultimate goal which is not
[48:07] death
[48:09] which is not the the end of life but
[48:12] which is a life beyond here and a life
[48:15] that we will forever be with our lord
[48:18] Jesus
[48:19] and these guiding principles they need
[48:22] to steer us towards that
[48:25] otherwise we are on this Earth to serve
[48:29] ourselves
[48:30] and everything that everything that we
[48:32] do and and even in coming to church what
[48:37] does this church mean
[48:39] do we come to church like this man
[48:41] sitting next to me do we come to church
[48:43] saying what can you do for me
[48:47] how is this church going to serve me
[48:50] or do we come with the attitude of Lord
[48:54] how can I serve other people
[48:57] what can I do as I'm there as a very
[49:00] Foundation of Christianity is to serve
[49:03] others
[49:04] the Lord Jesus came and he was the
[49:06] ultimate example for these things which
[49:09] is this is how I serve others and he was
[49:12] the sacrificial lamb that gave his life
[49:15] for all of us
[49:17] and not only did he give his life at the
[49:20] end
[49:20] this is so important but he gave his
[49:23] life from the beginning
[49:26] he never sinned
[49:28] we think we don't think of Jesus as
[49:31] being
[49:32] God made flesh
[49:34] we think of Jesus as just God
[49:36] he was God
[49:38] but don't forget the word teaches us
[49:40] that he was God made flesh
[49:44] so he had to go through this life with
[49:46] the same temptations that we have to go
[49:48] through
[49:48] and yet he did not sin he went through
[49:52] it not asking to be served but spending
[49:56] his whole life serving
[49:58] and doing for others and not snapping
[50:01] his finger and saying how can you serve
[50:04] me
[50:04] he came here as a servant
[50:08] and I was
[50:10] in this sermon seminar
[50:13] the most important thing about these
[50:16] guiding principles
[50:19] in in going down this road and to reach
[50:22] these ultimate goals
[50:24] every single principle taught us to work
[50:28] together
[50:30] because there is power in unity and
[50:33] brother Dan you've been in business for
[50:35] a long time I assume that that's the
[50:37] case with any company that you've ever
[50:38] been to that training and Leadership
[50:40] teaches you how to work together as one
[50:43] for a common goal
[50:45] and we this is how this this seminar was
[50:49] and I and I was thinking as I was
[50:51] learning this whole thing is not
[50:53] necessarily about the science and making
[50:55] some great discovery or or something
[50:57] that's going to curb global warming or
[51:00] coming up with with some sort of
[51:01] environmental
[51:04] um thing that'll take Plastics out of
[51:06] the ocean or something like that the
[51:08] ultimate goal was to work together
[51:10] because even Satan knows
[51:14] that if the people will be one that they
[51:18] are an Unstoppable Force
[51:20] every company in the world knows that
[51:22] every organization every government
[51:24] knows that if the people can be one
[51:28] then they can accomplish anything
[51:31] we see it in the Bible in the Book of
[51:33] Genesis we see the Tower of Babel
[51:36] and they all of these these people they
[51:39] had got together they they became one
[51:43] and their guiding principles were
[51:45] pointing them in One Direction was to
[51:48] build this great tower
[51:52] God looked down
[51:54] and he said this
[51:56] he said behold the people is one even
[52:00] used is
[52:02] it's not a mistake I didn't say it wrong
[52:04] he said behold the people is one
[52:08] and they are now capable of doing
[52:11] anything that they imagine to do
[52:16] this is a worldly group of people that
[52:19] don't have the Holy Spirit
[52:21] and they're they're moving together and
[52:24] they are able to change the world and
[52:26] build this Tower and God looks down and
[52:29] says wow he says he doesn't say wow he
[52:31] looks down he says I gotta change this
[52:33] he says I've got to stop this
[52:36] so then what what way could God do it to
[52:40] stop all of their working together and
[52:43] building this Tower he says I'm not
[52:45] going to let them communicate
[52:47] so he takes their language away from
[52:50] them
[52:51] and then the tower fails
[52:54] and we see that that but even in even
[52:57] without God
[52:59] unity and moving in direct in One
[53:02] Direction is a great powerful force
[53:07] then time goes on
[53:09] and we see in the book of Acts now we
[53:12] see the other side
[53:14] we see all of this group of people
[53:17] they have their guiding principles here
[53:21] and we see this group of people that
[53:24] receive the Holy Spirit and their
[53:26] guiding principles are keeping them on
[53:28] the path to introduce Jesus Christ to a
[53:32] Dying World that was the ultimate goal
[53:35] and these guiding principles and we read
[53:37] all through the New Testament that these
[53:40] guiding principles kept them on the path
[53:42] everything from from how how
[53:46] to live your life and and not to sin and
[53:49] and all of these and how to believe and
[53:52] how a church should function all of
[53:54] these things were guiding principles
[53:56] that kept them on the path to finally
[54:00] introduce eternal life
[54:02] to so many people
[54:05] and it was the greatest power
[54:08] that has ever been it was it was the
[54:11] outpouring of the Holy Spirit
[54:13] it started at the day of Pentecost and
[54:15] we've been going through the book of
[54:16] Acts and we see just the power and we
[54:19] see normal people like you and me normal
[54:22] people just filled with the holy spirit
[54:25] all in unity so much so it says that
[54:28] that they were of one heart and one soul
[54:33] moving forward in the power of the
[54:35] gospel and
[54:38] putting the word first
[54:40] keeping Within These guiding principles
[54:43] for an ultimate destination
[54:47] can you think
[54:49] of some guiding principles that the lord
[54:53] gave us
[54:54] can you think of what are the most
[54:56] famous ones
[54:58] yes the Ten Commandments
[55:02] so what happened is Moses was they had
[55:05] just come out of Egypt
[55:07] they were only on the on the road for
[55:08] like three months
[55:10] and they're out there in Moses goes up
[55:15] on Mount Sinai
[55:17] and he speaks to the Lord
[55:21] and
[55:22] and the Lord was was speaking back and
[55:26] and there
[55:28] he he sends Moses back down
[55:32] to the people and he says
[55:34] he says tell the people to get ready
[55:38] tell them to consecrate themselves he
[55:41] says tell them to stay outside the
[55:43] perimeter of this mountain he says but
[55:46] I'm going to come down and they're going
[55:47] to see me I'm going to come down
[55:49] in this thick smoke
[55:53] so Moses goes down and he and he tells
[55:55] the people
[55:56] and and the people make themselves ready
[56:00] and then the mountain starts shaking
[56:04] and and there was like a fire going
[56:06] through the mountain and it was it was a
[56:09] frightening thing
[56:11] but then
[56:13] God gives his Ten Commandments
[56:17] to his prophet
[56:19] and it says this and let's start with
[56:22] these Ten Commandments
[56:28] Exodus chapter 20.
[56:36] before I start reading
[56:41] as I said before God wants us
[56:45] together
[56:46] and he wants us moving in the same
[56:48] direction not a denomination not an
[56:50] organization but he wants us led by the
[56:53] same Holy Spirit each one of us
[56:56] and we look in the book of Acts each one
[56:58] of them had a different different role
[57:00] to play
[57:01] and if we don't have
[57:04] if we don't have that vision
[57:06] if we don't have as I said if we don't
[57:09] have this these these guard rails on the
[57:13] side then we can get off and the Bible
[57:15] many times talks about that men did what
[57:17] was right in their own eyes
[57:20] and it they would always they would
[57:22] always get off
[57:23] in Proverbs it says this it says the way
[57:26] of a fool is right in his own eyes
[57:31] so many times people want to serve
[57:34] themselves and they'll look at a
[57:36] situation and they'll make a decision
[57:38] and they'll say that you know what this
[57:40] serves me better
[57:42] so I'm going to do it this way
[57:45] when God wants it his way
[57:48] but most people in this world will make
[57:52] a decision on how this serves me better
[57:56] and as I said it Proverbs 12 15 it says
[57:59] this the way of a fool
[58:01] is right in his own eyes
[58:06] Exodus chapter 20 verse 1.
[58:11] God
[58:13] speaking and giving these first
[58:16] Commandments
[58:18] and God spake
[58:20] all these words saying
[58:23] I am the Lord thy God
[58:25] which have brought thee out of the land
[58:27] of Egypt
[58:28] out of the house of bondage
[58:31] Thou shalt have no other gods before me
[58:35] number one
[58:37] Thou shalt not make unto thee any Graven
[58:40] image number two or any likeness of
[58:42] anything that is in heaven above or that
[58:45] is on the earth beneath or that is in
[58:47] the water underneath Thou shalt not bow
[58:49] down thyself to them nor serve them for
[58:53] I the Lord thy God am a jealous God me
[58:57] only is what's God's saying
[58:59] visiting the iniquity of the fathers
[59:01] upon the children unto the third and the
[59:04] fourth generation of them that hate me
[59:06] and showing Mercy unto thousands of them
[59:08] that love me and keep my Commandments
[59:13] Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord
[59:17] thy God in vain number three
[59:21] for the Lord will not hold him Guiltless
[59:23] but taketh his name in vain
[59:26] remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy
[59:29] number four
[59:30] six days shalt thou labor and do all thy
[59:33] work but the seventh day is the Sabbath
[59:36] of the Lord thy God in it
[59:39] Thou shalt not do any work
[59:41] thou nor thy son nor thy daughter the
[59:44] man's servant nor thy maid servant nor
[59:46] thy cattle nor thy stranger that is
[59:48] within thy gates for in six days the
[59:50] Lord made Heaven and Earth and see and
[59:54] all that is in them and rested the
[59:55] seventh day
[59:57] whereof the Lord blessed the Sabbath day
[59:59] and hallowed it
[1:00:02] honor thy father and thy mother number
[1:00:04] five
[1:00:05] that thy days May belong upon the land
[1:00:07] which the Lord thy God giveth thee Thou
[1:00:11] shalt not kill number six Thou shalt not
[1:00:14] commit adultery number seven Thou shalt
[1:00:17] not steal number eight
[1:00:19] Thou shalt not bear false witness
[1:00:21] against thy neighbor number nine
[1:00:24] and thou shalt not covet number ten thy
[1:00:27] neighbor's house
[1:00:28] Thou shalt not cover Thy Neighbor covet
[1:00:30] thy neighbor's wife nor his man servant
[1:00:31] nor his maidservant nor zox nor zast nor
[1:00:34] anything that is thy neighbors
[1:00:37] and all the people
[1:00:39] saw the thunderings and the Lightnings
[1:00:41] and the noise of of the trumpet and the
[1:00:45] mountains smoking and when the people
[1:00:47] saw it they removed and stood afar off
[1:00:50] and they said unto Moses speak thou with
[1:00:53] us and we will hear but let not God
[1:00:55] speak with us but not God speak with us
[1:00:58] lest we die
[1:01:01] and Moses said unto the people
[1:01:03] fear not
[1:01:05] for God has come to prove you
[1:01:07] and that his fear may be before your
[1:01:11] faces that you sin not
[1:01:15] then God goes on to give more
[1:01:18] Commandments
[1:01:19] many many more Commandments and they all
[1:01:22] look like they pertain to one of these
[1:01:25] ten but he starts drilling down and
[1:01:27] being more specific and more specific
[1:01:29] and then in Exodus 23 verse 20
[1:01:33] God said
[1:01:35] behold I send an angel before thee to
[1:01:38] keep thee in the way and to bring thee
[1:01:40] into the place which I have prepared
[1:01:42] beware of him and obey his voice provoke
[1:01:46] him not for he will not pardon your
[1:01:49] transgressions
[1:01:51] for my name is in him
[1:01:53] but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice
[1:01:56] and do all that I speak
[1:01:58] then I will be an enemy unto thine
[1:02:01] enemies in an adversary unto thine
[1:02:04] adversaries
[1:02:08] thus God had given these Ten
[1:02:12] Commandments to the people
[1:02:15] and they started following this thing
[1:02:17] called this great thing God's word
[1:02:20] called the law
[1:02:24] and as time went on
[1:02:26] we see down through the prophets and as
[1:02:29] time goes on people it looks to me like
[1:02:32] people stopped looking at this law as
[1:02:36] The Guiding principles that was going to
[1:02:38] get them somewhere
[1:02:40] and they started looking at the
[1:02:43] principles
[1:02:44] they started just looking at the law and
[1:02:47] they ignored The Giver of the law
[1:02:51] until as time went on we get to the end
[1:02:54] of the Old Testament to This Book of
[1:02:55] Malachi
[1:02:57] and sin had just went through all of the
[1:03:02] people of Israel
[1:03:04] to the point where
[1:03:06] where they were they were looking at the
[1:03:09] law and they said okay we have to pay
[1:03:10] our tithes we have to we have to wash
[1:03:12] dishes in a certain way we have to we
[1:03:15] have to not eat catfish and not eat pigs
[1:03:19] and all these things and they had
[1:03:21] forgotten what these things represent
[1:03:24] they'd forgotten that this sacrifice
[1:03:26] that they were making
[1:03:29] it represented none other than the
[1:03:31] Messiah that was to come but they get
[1:03:34] caught up in the act of doing it they
[1:03:37] got caught up in just looking at the
[1:03:40] principles or the Commandments and they
[1:03:43] had forgotten what these Commandments
[1:03:45] were pointing them towards to learn the
[1:03:48] Book of Malachi
[1:03:50] they were to the point now they were
[1:03:51] still doing their sacrifices but God
[1:03:53] didn't mean enough to them anymore to
[1:03:55] give their best of the flock
[1:03:57] so they would give the worst
[1:04:00] it's like well I can I can spare this
[1:04:02] lamb it's not going to bring me much at
[1:04:03] the market and they would take that one
[1:04:05] and sacrifice it
[1:04:08] they wouldn't spend there they divorced
[1:04:09] their wives
[1:04:11] said oh well Moses wrote us the writing
[1:04:13] of divorcement over here so so I can
[1:04:15] just divorce my wife for any little
[1:04:16] thing
[1:04:18] even more they in Malachi 3 they
[1:04:21] wouldn't they don't even pay their
[1:04:22] tithes
[1:04:24] they're like well you know I'll give a
[1:04:25] little bit I'll give I'll give a little
[1:04:26] bit here and there and then we see that
[1:04:29] they had forgotten
[1:04:31] they were looking at the principles and
[1:04:34] they had forgotten where these
[1:04:36] principles should be taking them
[1:04:38] we looked at back to where God gave
[1:04:41] these Ten Commandments they were like
[1:04:43] three months for the Wilson I think
[1:04:45] that's right about three months that
[1:04:46] they were in the wilderness and they
[1:04:48] stayed there for another 40 years
[1:04:52] because the enemy came in and started
[1:04:53] making them talk about each other
[1:04:56] gossip about each other it says
[1:04:58] murmuring
[1:05:00] and that was the sin that kept creeping
[1:05:04] up is this murmuring and fighting among
[1:05:07] one another God hated it
[1:05:11] God would lead them and you have the
[1:05:13] pillar of Fire by by night and the
[1:05:16] pillar of cloud by day and they were
[1:05:17] following this thing Manna was coming
[1:05:19] down from heaven and all these great
[1:05:21] miracles happen and they complained
[1:05:24] God was doing all these things and you
[1:05:27] see it it goes all the way to the Book
[1:05:29] of Malachi to where now it was they had
[1:05:32] all of these different rules and
[1:05:34] regulations on how to wash dishes and
[1:05:36] how to wash their hands and all this
[1:05:38] stuff and it's things that God didn't
[1:05:39] even intend he had a purpose in doing
[1:05:42] these things and they had forgotten the
[1:05:44] purpose and made their doctrines on only
[1:05:48] the guiding principles
[1:05:50] and they had lost the meaning for the
[1:05:52] whole thing
[1:05:54] then
[1:05:56] after this Book of Malachi then
[1:06:00] came the one
[1:06:03] that
[1:06:06] was a fulfillment
[1:06:08] of all of these
[1:06:10] rules and regulations and laws
[1:06:13] that they had been talking about
[1:06:16] and yet like I said they were looking at
[1:06:20] the rules
[1:06:22] and disregarding the reason behind the
[1:06:26] rules
[1:06:27] brother Branham said this
[1:06:31] Revelation chapter 4 number 2.
[1:06:35] he says
[1:06:37] remember my sermon the other night
[1:06:40] brother Jordan do you have that is that
[1:06:42] brother or brother Noah
[1:06:47] I got two quotes
[1:06:50] I want to put them up because I want the
[1:06:52] people to read them
[1:06:56] uh Revelation chapter four number two
[1:06:58] it's the first one
[1:07:04] brother Branham
[1:07:06] he talks
[1:07:08] about a
[1:07:11] and it's a funny word he talks about a
[1:07:14] that received a gift
[1:07:18] and he unwraps a gift
[1:07:22] and he throws the gift away and he keeps
[1:07:24] the Box
[1:07:26] I'll read it says this
[1:07:28] remember my sermon the other night see
[1:07:30] like the
[1:07:32] he kept the box and throwed the gift
[1:07:34] gift away see don't take the box take
[1:07:39] the gift
[1:07:40] and I think about well when he says he
[1:07:44] says he says remember my sermon on the
[1:07:46] the other day he was referring
[1:07:49] to God's wrapped gift and this is the
[1:07:51] quote that he was referring to he says
[1:07:53] there's something for everybody that's
[1:07:55] right sinner friend there's something
[1:07:57] for the Gambler there's something for
[1:07:59] the liar there's something for every
[1:08:00] person there's something in this
[1:08:02] Christmas package for you don't cast it
[1:08:05] aside
[1:08:07] how Pharisee
[1:08:10] the foolish
[1:08:13] took the tensile
[1:08:15] and throw it away the gift
[1:08:18] what a pitiful thing
[1:08:21] so what they did is they took the
[1:08:23] guiding principles that were that were
[1:08:25] packages in packaging this great gift
[1:08:28] they took just the guiding principles
[1:08:30] and they threw away the gift
[1:08:33] and they just focused
[1:08:36] on the road to get there
[1:08:40] and they probably wouldn't if they would
[1:08:42] have understood they probably wouldn't
[1:08:43] have wandered in the wilderness for 40
[1:08:45] years
[1:08:48] The Seventh-Day Adventist
[1:08:51] they take these scriptures on the
[1:08:54] Sabbath
[1:08:55] about the Sabbath and then they've built
[1:08:58] a whole religion on if you worship on
[1:09:01] Saturday
[1:09:02] now you're the elect
[1:09:06] and they focus on this this one
[1:09:08] scripture that says that that honor the
[1:09:12] Sabbath and keep it holy but then
[1:09:15] they forget about why that this this
[1:09:18] sabbath was set in order
[1:09:20] the Sabbath was set in order Jesus said
[1:09:22] he made this statement it's a profound
[1:09:24] statement
[1:09:26] he said the Sabbath
[1:09:29] he says man was not created for the
[1:09:31] Sabbath
[1:09:33] he said the Sabbath was created for man
[1:09:37] so often we're looking at it's like
[1:09:40] we're looking at the Sabbath and the
[1:09:43] Sabbath was a gift from God God knew
[1:09:46] he loved us he knew that that if you
[1:09:49] didn't honor a day that you'd be working
[1:09:52] every day
[1:09:53] you'd be staying home and and today and
[1:09:56] staying home and watching watching the
[1:09:57] ball games and and not honoring the
[1:10:01] Lord's day but if he said this is a rule
[1:10:04] that you have to Worship On this day
[1:10:06] then he knew that they would honor that
[1:10:10] and go and be blessed by it
[1:10:13] but it wasn't created
[1:10:16] for God
[1:10:17] it was created to help us to encourage
[1:10:20] us to encourage these people to to
[1:10:25] worship and don't neglect those things
[1:10:30] but so often we're living a life that's
[1:10:33] focusing on The Guiding principles
[1:10:36] and The Guiding principles are not
[1:10:39] directing Us in the right path then we
[1:10:42] become just like the brother
[1:10:44] Branham said
[1:10:45] don't be a
[1:10:48] we don't want to be that
[1:10:51] we want to we want to have this gift
[1:10:55] so we we see these Ten Commandments come
[1:10:58] down and we see now Jesus comes on the
[1:11:00] scene and fulfills these Ten
[1:11:01] Commandments let's turn to Matthew
[1:11:03] chapter five and watch what Jesus says
[1:11:06] about these guiding principles
[1:11:11] verse 17.
[1:11:13] Matthew 5 17. he says think not Jesus
[1:11:17] speaking think not that I am come to
[1:11:19] destroy the law of the prophets I am not
[1:11:21] come to destroy but fulfill
[1:11:24] right there we see hey don't cut out the
[1:11:27] Old Testament
[1:11:28] this old testament's still true I hear
[1:11:31] so many people say well that's Old
[1:11:32] Testament yeah still God's word
[1:11:36] for verily I say unto you till Heaven
[1:11:38] and Earth pass past not one jot or one
[1:11:41] Tittle shall in no wise pass from the
[1:11:43] law
[1:11:44] till it all be fulfilled here he is he's
[1:11:46] talking about the Old Testament these
[1:11:48] are the words of God and they must be
[1:11:50] fulfilled
[1:11:53] he's saying that he's not giving Jesus
[1:11:55] is not giving a new set of principles
[1:11:57] here
[1:11:58] he's taking the ones that have been
[1:12:00] given and now he's showing us as we see
[1:12:03] a real Minister Jesus operating here
[1:12:06] he's showing us how to apply these in
[1:12:09] our own lives
[1:12:11] whosoever therefore shall break one of
[1:12:14] the least of these Commandments and T
[1:12:16] and shall teach men so
[1:12:19] he shall be called the least in the
[1:12:20] Kingdom of Heaven but whosoever shall do
[1:12:22] and teach them the same Shall be Called
[1:12:24] great in the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:12:26] for I say unto you that accept your
[1:12:29] righteousness shall exceed the
[1:12:31] righteousness of the scribes and
[1:12:32] Pharisees you shall in no case enter
[1:12:35] into the kingdom of heaven
[1:12:37] how could we
[1:12:39] how could our righteousness
[1:12:43] exceed that of these men that have lived
[1:12:46] their life from when they were babies
[1:12:48] as perfect as they could before the Lord
[1:12:53] I really believe it's because they
[1:12:54] weren't focusing on the god that gave
[1:12:58] them these Commandments they were
[1:13:00] focusing on just just the Commandment
[1:13:04] that's why it's so important that we
[1:13:06] understand what we're learning
[1:13:09] when we read this book
[1:13:12] understand it because these are the
[1:13:15] words of life we have to know we have to
[1:13:17] know many times we have to know why he
[1:13:19] said certain things
[1:13:21] when we're when we're teaching our kids
[1:13:25] we set a rule
[1:13:27] and sometimes the kids will follow and
[1:13:29] sometimes they won't but if you show
[1:13:31] them why
[1:13:32] to follow it now they understand
[1:13:37] if if you say here's here's the reason
[1:13:39] you don't stick those wires in the light
[1:13:41] socket
[1:13:43] because it's going to hurt you
[1:13:46] but you just say no don't do that first
[1:13:48] thing they're going to do is stick them
[1:13:49] in there but then they won't ever do it
[1:13:51] again
[1:13:57] verse number 21 you have heard that it
[1:13:59] was said of them
[1:14:01] of old time Thou shalt not kill
[1:14:03] and whosoever shall kill shall be in
[1:14:06] danger of the judgment
[1:14:08] he's on the sixth commandment here
[1:14:11] he's on the sixth guiding principle now
[1:14:14] he's gonna say here's why you don't do
[1:14:17] this
[1:14:18] something that that Jesus came to
[1:14:21] brought this understanding
[1:14:24] watch how the Holy Spirit applies it to
[1:14:26] their lives but I say unto you that
[1:14:28] whosoever is anger angry with his
[1:14:30] brother Without a Cause
[1:14:32] shall be in danger of the judgment and
[1:14:34] whosoever shall say to his brother raqqa
[1:14:36] shall be in the danger of the counsel
[1:14:38] but whosoever shall say thou fool shall
[1:14:41] be in danger of Hell Fire
[1:14:44] he's saying that yeah don't kill
[1:14:47] but apply this everywhere in your life
[1:14:51] there's very few people in the world
[1:14:54] that are murderers
[1:14:55] but how many of us
[1:14:58] are guilty of murder according to the
[1:15:01] Lord Jesus
[1:15:02] how many people in this room
[1:15:05] how many of us are guilty of murder
[1:15:09] brother Branham said this
[1:15:11] Hebrews chapter 7.
[1:15:13] number two
[1:15:15] he said you don't have to stick a knife
[1:15:17] in a man's back to kill him
[1:15:21] you can break his character and kill him
[1:15:23] you can kill his influence
[1:15:26] speak against your pastor here say
[1:15:27] something bad about him you might just
[1:15:29] as well as shot him
[1:15:32] told something that wasn't right about
[1:15:34] him well it'll kill his influence with
[1:15:36] the people like that and you're guilty
[1:15:39] of it what Jesus said
[1:15:40] and not just a pastor
[1:15:43] but of each other
[1:15:45] we can say something just just a little
[1:15:48] bit off
[1:15:50] or just a little bit right it might be
[1:15:53] perfectly true
[1:15:56] but then we'll say it and we'll hurt
[1:15:58] that person and kill that person's
[1:16:00] reputation and Jesus says right here you
[1:16:03] are guilty of murder
[1:16:07] I think how many of us in this room are
[1:16:10] guilty of murder
[1:16:12] we might not be in prison
[1:16:14] for spilling someone's blood but
[1:16:16] according
[1:16:17] to the Lord Jesus here we are guilty
[1:16:21] therefore if thou bring thy gift to the
[1:16:23] altar
[1:16:24] and there remember us that thy brother
[1:16:26] hath ought against thee leave it leave
[1:16:29] there thy gift before the Altar and go
[1:16:31] thy way first be reconciled to thy
[1:16:33] brother and then come and offer thy gift
[1:16:37] he's saying
[1:16:39] here that you're breaking the law so not
[1:16:43] God is not going to hear your prayers
[1:16:47] or receive your offering
[1:16:50] until you go and make this right
[1:16:54] until you go and make this murder or you
[1:16:57] make this lie or whatever it is until
[1:17:00] you go and you make that right I look
[1:17:02] here
[1:17:04] what an honor it was
[1:17:07] for them to be able to bring their gift
[1:17:10] into the church
[1:17:12] I see here Jesus is speaking and he's
[1:17:15] speaking to people that it was important
[1:17:17] that I'm able to contribute
[1:17:21] it's important that I'm able to to come
[1:17:23] in and do something for the church it
[1:17:25] was so important here and Jesus is
[1:17:27] saying he's not even gonna he's not even
[1:17:29] gonna let you he's not even going to
[1:17:31] hear or receive your offering until you
[1:17:33] go make this right and I think wow what
[1:17:35] a difference in today's society
[1:17:37] look at how many how important it was to
[1:17:40] these people to be able to contribute to
[1:17:43] be able to do something for the church
[1:17:46] and now we see people
[1:17:48] they don't want to do anything I'll show
[1:17:50] up on Sunday morning and and uh I'll get
[1:17:53] something out of it don't come to church
[1:17:55] to get
[1:17:57] come to church to give
[1:18:00] when when you're sitting there the
[1:18:02] person next to you should be benefiting
[1:18:05] from you being there
[1:18:07] that's the Christian way
[1:18:12] he says agree with thine adversary
[1:18:14] quickly whilst Thou Art in the way with
[1:18:17] them lest at any time the adversary
[1:18:19] deliver thee to judgment and the judge
[1:18:22] deliver thee to the officer and thou be
[1:18:24] cast into prison
[1:18:26] Jesus he's saying here it's it says in
[1:18:29] the English Standard Version it says
[1:18:31] come to terms with your accuser first
[1:18:34] and Jesus is saying in other words if
[1:18:37] you're going to go to the Judgment
[1:18:39] against someone
[1:18:41] if you stick to your guns with your
[1:18:43] argument
[1:18:45] you're risking the very worst punishment
[1:18:49] he says don't go there
[1:18:51] and I think in uh in law today they have
[1:18:53] what's called a plea bargain because
[1:18:56] because this accused this this person
[1:18:59] that's accused he sees that end result
[1:19:02] and he's like ah
[1:19:04] I don't want that
[1:19:06] so he makes makes a deal
[1:19:09] and this one we see here that that Jesus
[1:19:12] is saying listen if you take your
[1:19:14] brother
[1:19:16] to task on something you're risking
[1:19:20] you're risking a lot
[1:19:23] so Jesus is saying here don't don't do
[1:19:25] it you don't want to take that chance
[1:19:27] verily I say unto thee Thou shalt by no
[1:19:30] means come out hints till thou has paid
[1:19:32] the other most farthing
[1:19:35] if you're wrong he's saying you're going
[1:19:37] to pay for every penny
[1:19:39] you have heard that it was said by them
[1:19:41] of old time Thou shalt not commit
[1:19:43] adultery now we're on the seventh
[1:19:45] commandment
[1:19:45] Jesus here is quoting when I just what I
[1:19:48] read earlier
[1:19:51] but I say unto you
[1:19:53] that whosoever looketh on a woman
[1:19:56] to lust after her hath committed
[1:19:58] adultery with her already in his heart
[1:20:02] now we look and we see we see the
[1:20:05] and he's looking at this and he's saying
[1:20:07] well I didn't commit adultery I didn't I
[1:20:09] didn't sleep around to my wife no no no
[1:20:11] no no you're missing it you're just
[1:20:14] looking at the guiding principles you're
[1:20:16] not seeing the ultimate the ultimate end
[1:20:18] game here
[1:20:21] and it says here that he says that that
[1:20:23] you committed if if you lust after this
[1:20:26] woman you have committed adultery with
[1:20:29] her
[1:20:30] meaning there's two
[1:20:31] involved in this
[1:20:34] so if this man
[1:20:35] is looking out at this woman and he he
[1:20:39] just has a desire not that he does it
[1:20:42] Jesus is raising the level here he says
[1:20:44] if you just want to you're guilty of it
[1:20:48] with her so then now she's also
[1:20:51] guilty
[1:20:53] for presenting herself in that way
[1:20:57] for leading that man on for flirting
[1:20:59] with that man for presenting without
[1:21:01] presenting it that way so now she's
[1:21:03] guilty now you have two people guilty
[1:21:06] Jesus here he's saying this is the
[1:21:08] reason for this
[1:21:10] don't just look at the box look at the
[1:21:12] meaning behind it
[1:21:17] oh yeah
[1:21:25] we have
[1:21:27] our rules
[1:21:29] on how
[1:21:31] women should dress or how men should
[1:21:33] dress and all of these things but
[1:21:36] remember
[1:21:38] it's not the Box
[1:21:40] there's a reason behind it
[1:21:43] if you understand the reason
[1:21:46] then you're not going to go there
[1:21:50] understand the principle
[1:21:53] if I write I offend thee pluck it out
[1:21:56] and cast it from thee for it is
[1:21:58] profitable for thee that one of thy
[1:22:00] members
[1:22:02] for it is profitable profitable for that
[1:22:04] one of thy members should perish and not
[1:22:06] that thy whole body should be cast
[1:22:08] to hell
[1:22:10] the stakes are high
[1:22:12] and If thy right hand defend me cut it
[1:22:14] off and cast it from me for this
[1:22:16] profitable for thee that one of thy
[1:22:18] members should perish and not for thy
[1:22:20] whole body not that thy whole body
[1:22:22] should be cast into hell
[1:22:24] it has been said whosoever shall put
[1:22:26] away his wife
[1:22:28] let him give her a writing of
[1:22:30] divorcement
[1:22:31] they're looking back here
[1:22:35] to the law
[1:22:37] and saying oh
[1:22:38] I can do it Moses said I can divorce my
[1:22:42] wife
[1:22:45] Jesus says this but I say unto you
[1:22:48] that whosoever shall put away his wife
[1:22:50] saving for the cause of fornication
[1:22:53] causes her to commit adultery and
[1:22:55] whosoever shall marry her that is
[1:22:57] divorced commits adultery
[1:23:01] if the people understood the guiding
[1:23:02] principle of not committing adultery
[1:23:05] they wouldn't have tried to divorce
[1:23:06] their wives in the first place
[1:23:11] in another place Jesus was called out
[1:23:14] and they asked him they were trying to
[1:23:16] trying to trick him and they said well
[1:23:18] that that uh
[1:23:20] what about divorcing our wives and Jesus
[1:23:22] says he says no he says he says it
[1:23:25] wasn't so he says he says the Lord did
[1:23:27] that because of the hardness of your
[1:23:28] heart you're going to do it anyways
[1:23:32] he said but it wasn't so from the
[1:23:33] beginning
[1:23:36] let me let me talk
[1:23:39] I want to mention maybe to some of the
[1:23:41] young people
[1:23:43] that as you're going through life
[1:23:46] and as as you're getting older
[1:23:49] and you're thinking about marriage
[1:23:53] you're thinking about
[1:23:55] a man or a woman
[1:23:58] and how that that there's such Joy
[1:24:02] in having a companion
[1:24:05] and you might as you might see your
[1:24:07] parents or you might you might have this
[1:24:09] idea
[1:24:10] of spending your life with someone
[1:24:13] getting married and it's a wonderful
[1:24:15] thing it is it is a wonderful thing
[1:24:19] but be so careful
[1:24:23] be careful because if if if you're
[1:24:26] looking to someone because they're
[1:24:28] attractive or that they're successful or
[1:24:31] whatever it might be be so careful
[1:24:34] because you can ruin your life
[1:24:37] make sure that is the right person that
[1:24:40] you are marrying because it will destroy
[1:24:43] you
[1:24:45] wait on the Lord
[1:24:48] and and
[1:24:49] these guiding principles
[1:24:54] they're if you stay within them
[1:24:56] if you stay Within These Commandments
[1:24:58] from God and what this Bible teaches it
[1:25:02] will bring you to happiness
[1:25:05] but I cannot say enough how important it
[1:25:09] is
[1:25:10] to find the right mate
[1:25:14] I have seen so many lives ruined over
[1:25:17] the years so many times
[1:25:21] and it's because they got haphazard if
[1:25:24] there is any question in your mind
[1:25:27] about this person
[1:25:29] wait
[1:25:30] wait until you hear from the Lord and
[1:25:32] approach the Lord with an Open Heart
[1:25:34] Lord what what do you want me to do
[1:25:37] and he'll show you
[1:25:39] signs
[1:25:41] and it might be it might be he'll show
[1:25:45] you that he'll he'll he'll you'll see a
[1:25:48] sin rise up in that person
[1:25:51] or you'll see character
[1:25:54] rise up in that person
[1:25:56] be careful with what you want because as
[1:25:59] I said before he'll give you a sign
[1:26:01] you'll get a sign that's going to be
[1:26:03] what you want
[1:26:05] but surrender to the Lord and wait for
[1:26:10] his word on these things
[1:26:15] again
[1:26:16] young people not married
[1:26:18] be careful
[1:26:21] because this decision
[1:26:24] besides deciding to give your heart to
[1:26:27] the Lord
[1:26:28] deciding to serve the Lord is the most
[1:26:30] important decision that you'll make
[1:26:34] verse 33 again you have heard that it
[1:26:38] has been said by them of old time Thou
[1:26:40] shalt not forswear thyself
[1:26:43] but shall perform unto the Lord thine
[1:26:46] thy knows this part is a little hard to
[1:26:49] understand so I want to keep keep the
[1:26:52] King James but know if you can go along
[1:26:54] with me I want to keep the keep the King
[1:26:56] James up there and I'm going to read out
[1:26:58] of the English Standard Version verse
[1:26:59] number 33 says this
[1:27:01] again you have heard that it was said to
[1:27:03] those of old you shall not swear falsely
[1:27:06] but shall perform to the Lord what you
[1:27:08] have what you have sworn but I say to
[1:27:11] you do not take an oath at all either by
[1:27:13] heaven
[1:27:15] for it is the Throne of God or by the
[1:27:17] Earth for it is the footstool or by
[1:27:18] Jerusalem for it is the city of the
[1:27:20] great king and do not take an oath by
[1:27:23] your head for you cannot make one hair
[1:27:25] white or black let what you say be
[1:27:29] simply yes or no
[1:27:32] yay or nay
[1:27:34] anything more than this comes from Evil
[1:27:37] the Lord Jesus is saying that these
[1:27:40] Stakes are so high don't go before the
[1:27:42] Lord and say Lord I promise I'm not
[1:27:44] going to do that sin again
[1:27:46] just don't do it
[1:27:49] don't go and and stand and say
[1:27:52] I swear I've never cheated on my taxes
[1:27:55] or I swear I've never done this or I
[1:27:57] swear I will never do this let your yes
[1:28:01] be yes and your no be no and we should
[1:28:03] be living such a good life
[1:28:06] before the people of this world that
[1:28:08] they would look at us and say that man
[1:28:10] or that woman's word is concrete
[1:28:15] they have great character
[1:28:17] that's that's the way we should live our
[1:28:20] lives
[1:28:23] verse number 38.
[1:28:26] you have heard that it's been said an
[1:28:27] eye for an eye on a tooth for a tooth
[1:28:29] getting back to the Old Testament but I
[1:28:31] say unto you that you resist not evil
[1:28:34] but whosoever shall smite thee on thy
[1:28:36] right cheek turn to him also to the
[1:28:38] other
[1:28:41] and if any man
[1:28:44] again it's back to the Old Testament
[1:28:46] he's saying that that oh yeah it used to
[1:28:49] be an eye for an eye and a tooth for a
[1:28:50] tooth but if you understood
[1:28:53] this back then that okay it was fair
[1:28:56] that if this guy did this to me I can do
[1:28:57] it to him but now that those principles
[1:29:00] now become life and he says listen if
[1:29:03] somebody slaps you in the face take it
[1:29:07] let them do it
[1:29:13] and if any will sue thee at the law and
[1:29:16] take away thy coat let them have thy
[1:29:17] cloak also and whosoever shall compare
[1:29:19] thee to go a mile go with him Twain
[1:29:22] go two miles
[1:29:33] verse 42 give to him that asketh thee
[1:29:38] and from him that would borrow thee and
[1:29:41] turn not thou away
[1:29:44] and friends you know I look at this
[1:29:46] scripture give to him that assathy and
[1:29:48] from him that that would borrow a V and
[1:29:51] turn not away I I look at I know brother
[1:29:53] Branham said that there's three kinds of
[1:29:54] Believers in every congregation
[1:29:57] I've been on my heart all week I've been
[1:30:00] looking it's like seeing that there's
[1:30:01] three kinds of people in this world
[1:30:04] there are those that give
[1:30:08] and there are those that take
[1:30:12] and there are those that are in the
[1:30:13] middle
[1:30:16] and and I see that like this man sitting
[1:30:19] next to me may have been a very giving
[1:30:20] man I'm not trying to condemn him I just
[1:30:22] I'm just my impression of him
[1:30:25] he was a taker
[1:30:27] he wanted everybody to serve him
[1:30:31] and we come to church
[1:30:34] and and you see that there's people what
[1:30:36] are you going to do for me
[1:30:38] what was it there was a song Maybe done
[1:30:41] for me lately a long time ago was that a
[1:30:43] song
[1:30:44] I don't know nobody would admit it if it
[1:30:47] was
[1:30:48] it's okay to smile it's all right but
[1:30:53] it's not about that
[1:30:56] it's about what I can do
[1:30:59] and I see this
[1:31:01] give to him that asks
[1:31:05] let's skip for time's sake let's skip to
[1:31:08] the to verse number 48.
[1:31:11] it says this it says be ye therefore
[1:31:14] perfect
[1:31:16] even as your father which is in heaven
[1:31:19] is perfect
[1:31:22] think about that I think about wow
[1:31:24] that's that's a really high standard but
[1:31:27] Jesus commanded it
[1:31:29] be perfect we can't be perfect if we're
[1:31:33] like the and we're just we're just
[1:31:36] looking at the Box
[1:31:38] there's a gift inside of that box that
[1:31:41] we need to become one with
[1:31:44] and Jesus is saying here he's saying
[1:31:46] listen all of these things all of all of
[1:31:49] these Commandments that have happened
[1:31:51] that that Moses brought you follow those
[1:31:55] but they are to be make you perfect
[1:31:59] that is the ultimate goal
[1:32:01] is perfection
[1:32:04] perfection in the Lord
[1:32:08] it gets down
[1:32:10] you know it I think about
[1:32:15] I think about just
[1:32:17] think about just the church
[1:32:20] you know I think about
[1:32:21] about all of us and and the body of
[1:32:24] Believers around the world
[1:32:28] and I think about what Jesus said
[1:32:30] he says straight is the gate
[1:32:33] speaking of religious people
[1:32:36] straight is the gate and narrow is the
[1:32:39] way and few there will be that find it
[1:32:44] I think about this room
[1:32:47] and
[1:32:49] Lord
[1:32:51] there will probably be people in here
[1:32:54] that never enter into the kingdom
[1:32:58] I know that's not a great thing to say
[1:33:03] but it's a fact
[1:33:06] Jesus is saying here he's saying be ye
[1:33:09] perfect
[1:33:11] follow these Commandments these guiding
[1:33:14] principles that I have given you but
[1:33:16] don't stop with the guiding principle
[1:33:20] understand it and know where it's taking
[1:33:22] us
[1:33:24] we look at
[1:33:27] there's a scripture that that we use so
[1:33:29] often I think it's Deuteronomy 22 it
[1:33:31] says it says that a man shall not wear a
[1:33:34] garment pertaining to a woman and a
[1:33:36] woman shall not wear a garment
[1:33:37] pertaining to a man
[1:33:40] and we interpret that in a certain way
[1:33:42] let me tell you something when that was
[1:33:44] written
[1:33:46] there were no pants
[1:33:48] there were robes
[1:33:52] don't be a
[1:33:54] he was trying to separate the sexes
[1:33:57] he was saying a woman should be feminine
[1:34:01] she shouldn't act like a man and a man
[1:34:04] he shouldn't be he shouldn't be feminine
[1:34:09] he should act masculine
[1:34:12] and it took a prophet to come and to say
[1:34:15] that this is important today
[1:34:18] these things and now we see what it's
[1:34:20] led to never before we've seen such sin
[1:34:25] in the world
[1:34:26] we see these influencers in this garbage
[1:34:29] that we see on on on the social media
[1:34:32] and on YouTube and all that it's filth
[1:34:35] and look what it's led to
[1:34:38] it's not
[1:34:41] he was warning us
[1:34:43] he was saying here are your guidelines
[1:34:47] be careful of these things don't cross
[1:34:50] over
[1:34:51] we talk we talk so much about about
[1:34:53] clothes and dress but as I said it's to
[1:34:56] separate the Sexes you see now you see
[1:34:59] women you don't have to wear be wearing
[1:35:01] a pair of pants you can wear the pants
[1:35:02] in the family
[1:35:05] telling your husband
[1:35:07] we're gonna do this
[1:35:10] and then that husband
[1:35:12] because his walk with the Lord isn't
[1:35:14] good enough
[1:35:17] he doesn't he's not a leader in his home
[1:35:19] this book teaches us
[1:35:23] that that man should lead his home I'm
[1:35:26] not saying boss everybody around and all
[1:35:28] that that's that's not what it means
[1:35:31] it's saying that that man should live
[1:35:33] such a life as to represent Christ to
[1:35:35] his family
[1:35:38] and we see in Deuteronomy it's saying
[1:35:41] that you separate these things you
[1:35:44] separate these two genders because each
[1:35:46] one of them has a different role the two
[1:35:48] have different roles
[1:35:50] and Jesus
[1:35:52] repeats that we see in Romans it repeats
[1:35:56] it Romans chapter 1 we see throughout
[1:35:58] the Bible that
[1:36:01] it'll come to sin
[1:36:03] and then there's examples of how it's
[1:36:05] come to sin
[1:36:07] but instead we look at the Box
[1:36:10] instead we look at the rule
[1:36:13] and and deny what that rule is for
[1:36:18] it's for a masculine and a feminine
[1:36:21] being that God created
[1:36:28] think of
[1:36:29] the greatest
[1:36:32] all those guiding principles
[1:36:36] I'll close with this
[1:36:39] all of those guiding principles that we
[1:36:41] see all of those beautiful scriptures in
[1:36:45] the Old Testament
[1:36:47] and how that
[1:36:49] you can see that they they represent
[1:36:52] things
[1:36:54] that they're not meant as the is
[1:36:57] not meant to look at the box but there's
[1:37:00] something that is behind it
[1:37:03] and if we can if we can just understand
[1:37:06] what's behind if the musicians would
[1:37:08] come
[1:37:10] Jesus
[1:37:12] made
[1:37:13] such
[1:37:15] a beautiful statement
[1:37:18] I think of this this obedient Sun
[1:37:22] and
[1:37:23] how he lived this this perfect life and
[1:37:26] he said be ye therefore perfect as your
[1:37:29] father which is in heaven is perfect he
[1:37:31] told us to do that and I see Jesus going
[1:37:34] through his life
[1:37:36] and he makes this statement in John
[1:37:39] chapter 8. verse 29.
[1:37:43] he says this
[1:37:45] this
[1:37:46] is the guiding principle that we should
[1:37:51] always follow in our lives
[1:37:58] Jesus said in he that sent me is with me
[1:38:03] the father hath not left me alone
[1:38:07] for I do always
[1:38:11] those things that please him
[1:38:13] what a statement
[1:38:16] oh how I would love to be able to say
[1:38:19] that
[1:38:20] there is my guiding principle in life
[1:38:23] Lord I want to do everything that you
[1:38:27] command
[1:38:29] Lord let me
[1:38:32] follow
[1:38:34] these guiding principles that you've
[1:38:37] given
[1:38:38] let me understand them so that I might
[1:38:41] be able to say these same things that
[1:38:43] our lord Jesus said that I always do
[1:38:46] that which pleases my father
[1:38:49] it goes right back to that first
[1:38:51] commandment I am the Lord your God and
[1:38:54] thou shalt not have any other gods
[1:38:55] before me
[1:38:58] the father's first
[1:39:00] Jesus
[1:39:02] even in going to the Garden of
[1:39:03] Gethsemane he knew what was going to
[1:39:06] happen he gets down there and don't
[1:39:07] forget I said that he is God made flesh
[1:39:12] he gets down
[1:39:15] bows down on his knees and
[1:39:19] the weight of the world was upon him
[1:39:23] and he says this he says Lord
[1:39:28] says let this cup pass from me
[1:39:32] there he was a man
[1:39:35] Jesus Christ
[1:39:37] how can we relate to that I don't want
[1:39:39] to do this
[1:39:41] there's some things sometimes that we
[1:39:44] know that it's God's will
[1:39:48] but we don't want to do it
[1:39:49] [Music]
[1:39:52] well yeah Jesus is there and he says he
[1:39:54] says Lord let this cup pass from me
[1:39:59] but
[1:40:01] imagine if that would have been a period
[1:40:04] but
[1:40:06] thy will be done
[1:40:08] how beautiful what a beautiful statement
[1:40:11] he lived up to what he said I always do
[1:40:14] that which pleases my father
[1:40:16] always
[1:40:19] I'm gonna Lord I'm gonna do whatever you
[1:40:22] require of me I might be tired I might
[1:40:25] not want to do it
[1:40:26] [Music]
[1:40:27] I might not I might not wanna
[1:40:31] go and and
[1:40:34] and I always say go to church go to
[1:40:36] church or or might not want to go to
[1:40:38] work or I might not want to want to
[1:40:40] serve somebody
[1:40:42] but ask the Lord father what do you want
[1:40:46] there
[1:40:48] there is our example
[1:40:51] I always do that which pleases the
[1:40:54] father
[1:40:55] Jeremy I want to do it
[1:40:58] no I don't want to I don't want to waste
[1:41:00] any more time I want to Lord I want to
[1:41:02] do everything I want to follow the
[1:41:04] example of the Son of God these guiding
[1:41:07] principles that Moses brought and the
[1:41:10] prophets brought they they lie in our
[1:41:12] ways and if we can just stay within
[1:41:14] within those guiding principles with the
[1:41:17] ultimate goal of this Holy Spirit
[1:41:18] telling us what to do at all times
[1:41:21] always doing that which pleases the
[1:41:24] father
[1:41:25] that's what I want
[1:41:27] do you want the same thing
[1:41:31] how do we do it
[1:41:33] how do we please
[1:41:36] him how do we how do we get to know him
[1:41:38] how do we how do we hear his voice
[1:41:41] [Music]
[1:41:43] ask the question to the congregation
[1:41:46] to each person
[1:41:47] what are your guiding principles in life
[1:41:53] what's guiding every decision that you
[1:41:55] make
[1:41:56] foreign
[1:41:58] what's bringing you down this road how
[1:42:01] are you making decisions
[1:42:04] does it to Serve Yourself
[1:42:07] for me is it just Lord is it to serve
[1:42:09] myself
[1:42:12] or can I say and I want to say it so bad
[1:42:15] can I say Lord I always do that which
[1:42:17] pleases you
[1:42:18] I make mistakes of course I make
[1:42:20] mistakes
[1:42:22] just wasn't saying don't make mistakes
[1:42:24] when he said be thou perfect
[1:42:25] [Music]
[1:42:28] saying
[1:42:30] follow these principles
[1:42:33] [Music]
[1:42:35] that you might understand that you might
[1:42:37] go to the father that the Lord Jesus
[1:42:41] might present us
[1:42:43] to the father
[1:42:45] I believe it's Romans
[1:42:48] chapter I believe it's Romans chapter 12
[1:42:50] it says
[1:42:52] give your body as a Living Sacrifice
[1:42:55] to the Lord I want to read it
[1:42:59] I can't I can't skip it believe the Lord
[1:43:02] wants it read
[1:43:03] [Music]
[1:43:08] I beseech you
[1:43:11] Romans 12 verse 1 I beseech you
[1:43:14] therefore Brethren by the mercies of God
[1:43:16] that you present your bodies a Living
[1:43:19] Sacrifice
[1:43:21] holy and acceptable to God which is your
[1:43:25] reasonable service
[1:43:26] [Music]
[1:43:28] and be not conformed
[1:43:30] to this world
[1:43:32] but be ye transformed by the renewing of
[1:43:35] your mind
[1:43:36] that you may prove
[1:43:38] what is that good and acceptable and
[1:43:42] perfect will of God
[1:43:46] how I want to be able to go before him
[1:43:50] with the son of God
[1:43:52] say how I always did that which pleased
[1:43:54] my father
[1:43:55] all those mistakes that I've made
[1:43:57] they're gone they don't matter all the
[1:43:59] mistakes that I'm going to make in the
[1:44:00] future it don't matter
[1:44:02] but if my heart is right and I'm not
[1:44:05] staring
[1:44:07] at the Box
[1:44:10] but I understand why he gave it
[1:44:13] I understand why it was important that
[1:44:18] that we underst that that we know the
[1:44:21] difference
[1:44:22] the differences between men and women
[1:44:24] that we understand why it's important
[1:44:27] that that the men don't look at women in
[1:44:31] the wrong way and the women don't look
[1:44:33] at the men in the wrong way and each one
[1:44:35] isn't presenting themselves in the wrong
[1:44:37] way
[1:44:38] not rules like the morons looking at but
[1:44:43] understanding that there is an end game
[1:44:46] to this
[1:44:51] in all friends goes towards
[1:44:55] this be perfect as your father which is
[1:44:57] in heaven is perfect
[1:45:00] please we have communion
[1:45:03] coming up this weekend next weekend
[1:45:08] please think on these things
[1:45:12] think on
[1:45:14] Lord what are my guiding principles in
[1:45:16] my life
[1:45:18] because you make your guiding principles
[1:45:20] each one of us
[1:45:22] we're making these principles and we're
[1:45:25] saying Lord I'm going to live my life in
[1:45:27] this way for what reason is it to
[1:45:29] benefit me
[1:45:31] or is it to benefit my brother my sister
[1:45:34] is it to serve God we cannot
[1:45:38] we cannot do anything for God
[1:45:42] he's Sovereign he's our creator he's
[1:45:45] Eternal he's perfect but what we can do
[1:45:47] is we can serve his children
[1:45:51] and that's what he requires now we see a
[1:45:54] book of Acts we see a Tower of Babel
[1:45:57] erected and he destroyed it but then we
[1:46:00] see a book of Acts that was far greater
[1:46:02] brother Wilson than that Tower of Power
[1:46:05] it was God's people working together
[1:46:08] serving each other
[1:46:10] please
[1:46:12] please
[1:46:13] sitter
[1:46:15] your guiding principles in life
[1:46:18] consider what you're living your life
[1:46:21] for considering how you're making your
[1:46:23] decisions is it because of the box
[1:46:26] or is it because of the spirit behind
[1:46:29] is it because of the gift that was in
[1:46:31] the box
[1:46:32] [Music]
[1:46:35] feels important
[1:46:37] I feel maybe ask
[1:46:40] maybe the congregation
[1:46:42] ask you if
[1:46:45] [Music]
[1:46:48] but while maybe we can put off the book
[1:46:50] of Acts till Wednesday

[1:46:55] sermon prepared for this evening and I
[1:46:57] was I was thinking about a sermon too I
[1:46:59] didn't really know what decision to make

[1:49:02] in this world there is nothing any of us
[1:49:04] could ever say
[1:49:06] that could take the place of you
[1:49:08] speaking just one word from God
[1:49:11] just one word from him from him speaking
[1:49:14] to you is more than anyone in this whole
[1:49:16] world could say

[1:49:23] I just don't I don't
[1:49:29] take it seriously

[1:49:34] don't neglect our Lord that that did so
[1:49:37] much for us
[1:49:39] put him first let these guiding
[1:49:42] principles in this book let them point
[1:49:44] you to the one that that gave us life
[1:49:47] and that will give us eternal life
[1:49:51] we do it don't neglect it
[1:49:55] it's about our heads
[1:50:06] I'm sorry for all my sins
[1:50:14] Lord
[1:50:17] there's nothing that we could ever do
[1:50:18] [Music]
[1:50:22] but
[1:50:24] the only thing that we can try to do
[1:50:25] Lord is to follow your word
