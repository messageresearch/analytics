liliana when i was asking her or saying something about if she knew it grace said well that was the first song she ever learned to play so this is good i don't really think of myself as an old person

song this morning so if you know it sing it with us and we'll just maybe sing the first and second verse brother matthew there son this old house once knew my children this old house once knew my wife

sing a song here jesus we just want to thank you for being so good we have a few prayer requests and praises this morning i'll just take those at this time ed dougal would you just come this morning and speak to the lord on our behalf [Music] let's just do this praise first but jeremy baggett says he is a little nephew this morning sister priscilla coffee had a little little one raphael david edward coffee and eight pounds 11 ounces 20 inches so i'm sure brother and sister baggett are happy to have another little grand what grand grandson in the family amen so just continue to keep them in prayer i know brother joe coffey had posted something the other day on a group i was in just that sister priscilla has been dealing with i believe it was arthritis some kind of rheumatoid arthritis and he just was claiming that that would just not be anymore and would just be taken care of and he was asking the brothers that he was posting to on this group just to believe with him that it wasn't going to be a problem anymore so let's just remember that her just keep her in prayer that her faith would just be increased and there'd be never no doubt that we'd enter in there amen amen we thank the lord for healthy life as well amen sister elizabeth getta says please pray for me i've had a chronic cough for several months thank you and god bless you i just remember her in prayer and then sister connie carey kevin messaged me this morning called talk to brother ed and i believe brother lyon brother ed prayed for with brother kevin on the phone but sister connie has been diagnosed with

these bodies and give them praise and thanks [Music] gracious heavenly father it's a with joy and happiness that we can approach your throne of grace and mercy this morning on behalf of these needs

into your hands in jesus christ's name amen [Music] during covent time but why don't you just turn around you don't have to shake hands if you don't feel comfortable but maybe give a wave or a little virtual handshake if you want to shake hands that's fine i had no problem with that but just do i know it's got the services that brother pose shalom tabernacle friday night and did everyone turn around shake hands and it was just nice to kind of see everyone around and see who was there so anyway amen let's turn the service over to brother aaron we'll just sing maybe a couple more songs let's

[Music] amen amen that he watches close to us amen and you're singing that song hallelujah i have found him whom my soul so long had craved but the honest truth was you didn't find him you realized at that point yes that's who thank you god bless you i just i was enjoying myself back there it's just good to be in the house of the lord this morning so let's read that first scripture there it's kind of the john 16 33 i've used it a few times but you know you could read the same scripture every day and it still it still has the authority it still has the power it doesn't change and sometimes you you read something over and over till you finally begin to re it begins to have its effect and things so jesus saying to the he was speaking to the disciples here but it's to all of us these things have i spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world so let's just bow our heads lord we thank you take your word and we read your word lord today we have it in printed form and we can listen to we can turn our phones on and the computer and there's just so many ways to to see your word to read your word to hear your word today lord and back there in the in the old testament the time of the children of israel lord they would gather and someone would read speak to them the words of god and today we have the the the privilege to have it with us all the time lord but not only that but to have the very author the very god of this word the very god made flesh living in us today lord and and not only is just to read and hear the word but the very of the word living in us lord and we appreciate that lord may you bless us now as we speak your word may encourage our hearts lord to everyone that is listening on the hook up lord or maybe streaming today that couldn't be here lord may your presence go to them also lord we ask in jesus christ's name amen you may be seated there just a couple of things too we've reached out to a few brothers recently just to invite them to come on out brother tim cross brother joe adams um brother dwayne lawson and brother nathan erickson these are all brothers who have all told us if you if you'd like to have us come just let us know that we'd be able to arrange something so brother nathan has has committed to uh here in november coming out visiting with us and the other brothers are looking at their schedules and i remember one time asking brother dwayne lawson and he said his schedule is generally six months out his book solid six months so kind of and now brother ray erickson is having him stay home a lot now as brother ray erickson may be stepping down and brother lawson being the pastor of their church but the lord knows all those things so and so we're just looking at some of those things to to continue on what the lord would do for us as as we we go forward so and um we know there was different families that have been affected we also heard yesterday the samarano family sister margaret sister marianne and they said one of her sisters and one of their aunts all tested positive with kobet also but that's nothing to god he's the healer he's already done the work brother branham said many times he says he can't he can't heal you now if you came and asked him him he'll say i've already done that he's asking us to believe and he reminds us in his word these things have i spoken unto you that you might have peace peace is the absence of war but not in the physical because there's always a battle with the flesh there's always a battle with something there's a battle with traffic sometimes there's just all kinds of things that we you know you get aggravated about i don't know too many people just sit in a traffic jam and just enjoy it maybe if you could close your eyes and sleep for a while that would be okay but most of the time you get anxious you go like i'm gonna be late i'm gonna you know and it just it's just who we are sometimes but he says that you might have peace they might have rest there might be a a place where you say you know lord brother jordan sing that song i sing because i'm happy and i'll just giving god praise saying lord i know you've got all things in this old house i remember that song from way back way before brother jordan was born probably his dad and mom used to have a lot of songs playing with the old albums at the house and that's an old song this old house and as a kid you're thinking about a physical house you know but this old house is the one i won't get rid of you know the parts don't always work anymore and replacement parts are very expensive um go to a body shop you know i think that's what they call the hospitals but there's a body prepared for us oh and i appreciate that and then he says but be of good cheer smile there's a hope that lies within you there's something that that makes you get up in the morning and says yes lord i can go through another day for i have overcome the world now these words were spoken by jesus to his disciples before calvary and he's already making that statement i have overcome the world because he says he went back from before the foundation of the world the lamb had been slain so to god it was as good as done and i appreciate that the the gospel of jesus christ is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever so let's have some just continue on the same line a little bit as we did last sunday brother noel what he has spoke what we heard from brother ferguson on friday night the different ones that spoke the the theme just continues and i said to somebody i don't remember who was i said just isn't it amazing how the theme just goes almost like us brother sat together and said let's plan this for the next six months and as i thought that i go no no no no it's the same one each brother ministering is being inspired by the same one and that's god and we have to have that confidence lord you know if you have us here it's for a reason and the confidence that god is going to speak to us and help us so let's start with saint john 11 and we'll read verses 21 to 27. where jesus has come because lazarus had gotten the news that lazarus was sick and then he didn't hurry over he took his time because there was an appointed time there was a set time there was something god is going to do and i just wonder if we knew all those things would we really have faith or would we really trust them say lord is in your hands i can rest because most of us as humans if we know the specific time of day we're generally not getting ready till then but if if you know somebody come over to visit you they say we may be there in the morning we may be there in the evening you're up early you're getting the house clean you're getting everything ready for company but if they say we won't be there till seven you know like some of us you might start at 6 45. that's just our tendencies but jesus knew what he was going to take place so we go here and then and and he's talking now he's come to come to elabs now and martha comes out to meet him and he said and and martha jackson express she has this confidence and said martha until jesus lord if thou had been here my brother had would have not died i know you i know that he would not have died you've been here you would have just healed him he says but i know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of god god will give it to thee there's that calm there had to be a reason something that had gone inspired they'd watch that gave them that confidence you know let's go jesus said saith unto her thy brother shall rise again martha knowing the scripture she said martha said unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day and this is what he want to look at here jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live 26 and 27 and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die then he looks at her and says believeth now this is it a revelation in your heart has it anchored into your heart it gets personal with it and she saith on him yay lord i believe if thou art the christ the son of god we should come into the world but he says i am the resurrection and i go to this thought just get ahead the resurrection is living in you and he hasn't changed so you could say i am the resurrection amen oh wait a minute because he lives in you for those of us that were there on friday night and brother ferguson was ministering and he got into a portion there reading some things that brother branham said he said when that believer that and speaking then of the the israelites and with the law and taking that sacrifice taking that lamb and presenting it to the priest there for the sacrifice for his own sins and he talked about placing their hands at the head of the lamb while they're taking in that blood understanding realizing that lamb was taking their place i should have been crucified i should have suffered and died but jesus god's son took my place and and to see that he goes and when they placed it and and the lamb took and the blood got all over their hands and all they realized that their sins were now covered but brother brandon gets into it at that same time in looking at what jesus christ did for us we place our hands on him we take it by faith we believe and we accept his forgiveness the blood in us see your sins your iniquity your failures are all transferred to him because it was all put on that lamb that's kind of hard to understand it's not hard to believe sometimes they comprehend but that's what the word of god teaches us and that is it was all transferred to that lamb now in the old testament they didn't their sins could not be taken away or anything it was just covered they had to do it once a year but when you place and believe that the sacrifice that jesus christ did for you on calvary and you triumph your sins are transferred to him and his righteousness is transferred to you therefore righteousness lives in me am i righteous in my own flesh no the righteous one living in me but this is a statement this is what really anchored it down to me you can't have one without the other oh i've come lord i've confessed my sins i've i've placed them in you and then you walk away and you just but i'm still a sinner i'm still no good or you say yes i'm the righteous one and they got in you you get people going to the other side but when you transfer your sins to him and he takes them he gives you his righteousness and in that righteousness is what we walk with because he said i am the resurrection now you're stopping all like i did and you're starting to look at yourself and say man there's there's a lot of things that aren't righteous in this guy but i'm not looking to that i'm looking to what he said because if i look to myself that's as far as i'll ever get but if i can take him at his word and walk on that i woke up this morning with my mind on jesus he's the word of god he became flesh the word of god became flesh he he wore the body of flesh so that he could understand that he could mediate for you that he could feel for you that all of that so when you take the word of god and you apply it to your life you are taking the very words of god you're taking god himself into your life and he says i am the resurrection it's not i will be but i am i'm living in you today again martha answers and and she says i know that he'll rise again and he says you're standing in front of the resurrection himself that's the word of god and then in mark chapter 11 and i know that we read these scriptures and we hear these scriptures but they began to come life 23 and 24 mark 11 23-24 for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore i say unto you these things so so ever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them now i remember as a kid hearing that and i imagine mountains physical mountains being moved that was as a child but i realized these catalina mountains don't give me any problems in fact i get more enjoyment out of the catalina mountains than the ones i get on here the ones that i create in my own life the things that i seem impossible hard to get over to get through but that's the mountains he's talking about because the disciples had just been with him and and jesus and they're going in and he's hungry and he comes up to a fig tree and the scripture tells us it wasn't even time for figs yet but he was hungry and because he saw there was no figs he cursed that tree he said you're going to die from your roots you're not going to give figs and when they come back peter is the one that managed he's marvel he said look the very the very tree that he cursed here in such a short time it's withered away it's all and jesus turns around and looks at me says whatsoever just understand this was a lesson for you to learn whatsoever you ask so i just want to to look at this and i want to see how god has done that for us in our life today we read a few quotes here from the handwriting on the wall he says remember it's the motives that you have towards anything that determines what you're going to get out of it i i i go and it's go sit down in a restaurant and brother noel has told me man that's a good restaurant it's a good place i really love the food there and i go i go with that anticipation it's gonna be good food now if it isn't good food it's not brother noel's fault for some reason but i go with that anticipation but if somebody told me and i know this this works i know this happens because brother green dismissed the service one night here years ago we were going to go visit another church and there was a brother who's going to minister he was well known brother i had never heard him and i was excited about getting to hear this brother minister but that day somebody told me do you know that this brother believes so-and-so and i sat through that whole service saying that was good brother but i know what you believe it had no effect on me had no good effect on me and i had no idea if the brother believed that or not but somebody said that to me and sometimes if we're not careful something will get we'll say something we'll do something with him and it'll break that possibility or that effect that it could have in your life where if you would come lord you know i need you today lord i have a desire for you today would you minister would you speak to me would you do something and not let everything else influence you there he says it's the motive that you have towards anything that term determines what you're going to get out of it it's your motives if your motive is right you'll be all right but always make your motives right serve the lord for one purpose because you love him not because you're afraid of hell not because you're afraid of dying but because you love him who loved you when you were unlovable that's it you know i've never seen anybody take a little child in their hands oh what a precious darling little thing lovely little thing but then they start to grow up and they start to and sometimes boy that's that same little child that i said oh what a beautiful kid i'd like to grab him by the neck right about now no that's probably just me but you know you understand what i mean you know he said he loved you when you were unlovable he looked past beyond all of that the conflict between god and satan he says see and if god made a promise that is eternal there's nothing nowhere can stop it they couldn't turn every atom upside down and turn it backwards could ever pierce the word of god one little word see because jesus said both heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail see that's the best weapon there is it's the word of the eternal god that never fails and another quote on from that same message conflict between god and satan he's standing out there for his children and i just it was just a short quote whatever he's standing out there for his children what are we scared about the rapture is sure the coming is sure every blessing that's been promised is ours all belongs to us now then he says we kind of slack up and say satan say come around over this side i'll reason that out with you oh you got behind the father again he says don't do that don't start listening to your own reasoning to your own figuring i know he's the lord god the hill of my disease but this pain has been with me for however amount of time he's still the lord god he said don't start to reason it because it doesn't take long when you start figuring well i must have done something wrong i must and pretty fun you've got a mess in your hands well you can stand there say that's what god's word says and that's what i'll stand on the message paradox and this this kind of i want to get to this thought today it's again maybe another part from last sunday who i am lord not who not questioning who am i but who i am standing on that i see a woman raise her hand just then back in the building praising the lord it was hattie wright sitting down there and when she had two boys if they'll excuse me in saying this renegades boys of the world that little woman sitting there day that day a widow and i said hattie the lord god you said the right thing he provided the squirrels he's jehovah jireh she said that's nothing but the truth of god oh she said the right thing it seems incredible that a human being could speak a word well that's god that's god but it seems incredible that you could say something and god does it this is my beloved son he says hear ye him this is my beloved son in who i am well pleased was that for jesus only now that's for all his children so thinking on that line speaking the right thing saying the right thing doing the right thing pleasing god standing by faith walking by faith recognizing that you are a son and daughter of god not just on sunday church and wednesday church but 24 hours a day 365 days of the year all the time you are have always been a child of god brother branham was and i don't know that he was the first but he was a seventh eighth messenger to get it out to the people you were a thought and you're an expression of god today sometimes our thoughts stay in our mind for a long time sometimes you want to think about something you want to meditate on it you want to you want when you say it you want to present it the right way and and the bad times are when you don't think about it long enough and you say something it comes out wrong and you always say boy i wish i could take all of that back today but god in his mind saw you already the bible says he was a lamb slain from before the foundation of the world so he knew there were going to be people that were going to need to be saved they were going to need to be healed that we're going to need to be cleansed they were going to need to be redeemed back and he made preparation for that in his mind he had seen it already so as as we look at that and god begins to unveil that in it through each one of the age each messenger paul takes in and a good portion of the new testament is written or or dictated by paul may be written by others but they were the words of paul that we're saying which were the words of god to us today it wasn't paul's uh being able to figure out this because paul was going to persecute was persecuting the christian who was going against god in his self-righteous way he said no the the law what moses brought that that's god and didn't realize what was what had changed but then he meets god himself and in the meeting of god two things happen you recognize god and you go with him or you turn your back and you go the other way there's no neutral neutral place to stand there you make your decision one way or the other but the seed of god responds back to god and that's why you're here today i i don't i don't recall ever thinking in my young life when i get about 16 years old the message of the age the hour's going to come it's going to change my life i'm going to move to tucson and i'm going to meet my wife there i'm going to no i didn't know any of that was going but god did god god arranged the events in our life my father and mother's life for us to get to this place 19 late 1974 dad injures his back and work and then he's fully disabled and can't work anymore i do remember him saying he wanted out of southern california even back then it was not a good place to be we had no idea a message was coming our way but about time a mess god had prepared a way for us to be able to come i didn't know that i didn't plan that but god had in his mind and we have to believe that everything in our life is ordered by god even when you make a mistake even when you fail even when you go the wrong way or else i don't think he would have used the prodigal son when he's talking about the prodigal son who just walks out of his father's house says give me my inheritance i'm going to go live my own life and jesus talks about that but then the son comes to one day and he realizes in my father's house their slaves or the servants have it better than i do where i am now watch his attitude i am no longer good enough to be a son i'm not worthy to be called his son i'm going to go back which was the best thing he could have done but his attitudes changed i'm no longer good enough to be a son i'll just go back and i'll go back to my father's house but i'll just be a servant but the father has been looking for his son the bible doesn't say anything about any qualifications outside of it's my son so when the son comes up to the father and he says father i have sinned against thee. we've all been there we've all done that i'm not worthy to be called your son anymore i i'm just you know just relegate me to the back and that'll be okay and he said no no no you are my son i've been waiting for your return i've been waiting for you to recognize that you are my son and you come back home understand you've made a mistake you've made you've done things in your life but you're still a son and daughter of god and he's telling you come home so we see that he says she said that's nothing but the truth and god tells brother branham you tell her she can have anything she wants when you read that brother brown said if she had asked for a million dollars today we might up that a little bit 25 million would have made a difference to god he owns a cattle in a thousand hills every vein of gold every ounce of silver is his it all belongs to him he said she can have but a child of god doesn't look for personal wealth and personal uh to be known a child looks at god how can i help somebody else have this that i have and she turns around the salvation of my two boys immediately that's how child god and and you know it's it's amazing how many times god has said you say you say you speak it's it's easy to put it on on a brother a minister something like that but he's telling you sometimes you're alone in a situation alone in a place somewhere all by yourself and there's nobody to call but you and god are a majority over any situation and you have to recognize who you are i was just recounting some things in in my own life and and god has done in my own life personally just to let me know how mindful he is of me and and never once has he come up to me and said now i'm going to do this for you today but if you ever mess up again this is the last one now he has taken me and done this to me to get my attention he has done this to me to get my attention he has done this to me to get my attention but when god does that he does it for your good yes not always in anger uh like sometimes we as parents did it or do it still sometimes except for my girls i know they never make me angry so that's i thank the lord for my family i know i call them out quite a bit but the lord has blessed me with a wonderful family and i appreciate that so but to think about things that god has done i i asked i gave the picture to brother jordan and then brother jerry jeremy came back and they didn't get it so hopefully did you get that picture can we put that up no not that picture i never did name him but he sits on the wall up at the cabin and this is the last week that's my boss's cabin because he sold it and so we won't be able to use it again but that's the elk my sister shirley moore let me use one of her guns i was going hunting and that's how the lord gave me there and i know how that out came into hunt thank you brothers um we were out hunting there was my boss my old boss and three were using his cabin this i think it'll be five years this coming november and uh my boss got his elk on friday so saturday we went back to that same place he said this let's hunt from the same area and i'll sit up above you and i'll i'll um i'll watch and you watch the left side i'll watch the right side so that we're not swiveling the whole time and and so we're sitting there and it's the sun has come up and and what happened there were so many hunters they were everywhere that they move around so much that the elk began to run out and that was a thing so to my right i hear him say to you right to your right and i turn and there's two elk running across about 100 yards out running through the meadow and i pick my gun up and i'm i shoot twice and i miss twice my boss says man there must be something wrong with the gun i said nothing to do with the gun that was me you know every time the elk went down my gun went up and it was quite a bit a little bit opposite so we were sitting there and he i never rifle hunted like that i'd always archery hunted and he kind of told me what to do and we kind of went over it and he said get behind that log and use the one of the branches to steady the rifle and he says you watch to the left i'll watch to the right we're sitting there and i know how the lord speaks to me and each one of you should know how god speaks to you you should you should understand when it's the lord getting your attention because you've experienced enough times and he has spoken to me four times audibly the angel of the lord what is four times in my life but this time it was just an impression of a thought in my mind and he just asked me what are you here for and my first response i'll just be honest with you i just said that's for brother branham lord and he waited a little bit and he said what are you here for and again i said but that was for brother branham lord and the third time he asked me again what are you here for and about then i began to understand he's talking to me we're sitting on this side there's it's a small meadow there's a hill up on this side and i could see a trail and we had scoped out the distances so i knew how far it would wouldn't have to figure it out that's 100 yards that's 150 yards that's you know like that and there was a trail it came down kind of curl like this came right down the middle and then came right in front of us and i said lord i wanted to from up there come down that trail come this way and right here in front that's all i said sat there and a little bit later i look up in the beginning that trail where i could see it came over the ridge there's two elk there but the trees cover their heads so i couldn't tell if they were bulls or they were cows so i get my boss's attention i said the two elk up there and he says don't shoot the first one shoot the second one and i said but i have a heart shot at the first he goes now wait till they move so the first one steps down it was it was a ball but real small and then this one stepped out and i put the shot right through his heart knocked him down right there we got over and we got our elk but it took me a little while the first elk ran down that trail came down the middle ran right in front of us turned around and ran back exactly what i asked for but it took me a couple hours to realize that what i asked for god had done you have to come that in your life because it's you and god it's easy to give it to the minister it's easy to give it to this brother it's easy to give it to brother branham to paul but what about your life recognizing who you are and what god does for you in your life and i've shared these things and these are new here back here when the kids were all much younger and they would all play ball after on a sunday night they'd all be the boys were playing basketball the kids were running around and there was a young little girl she was probably about four or five years old she was running around and something happened to her and i didn't see that part but sister sandra miles picked her up maybe she was three four or a little smaller and she comes up to me and says brother erin look at her and her head had rolled back and her eyes had gone white and i didn't think i just reached my hand i said little sister in the name of lord jesus christ i give you back your life that's the words that came out her eyes rolled right back up and she said put me down he should put down and she ran off full speed i don't know what was wrong with her it didn't make a difference i just gave her back her life in the name of the lord jesus christ that's what god does i'll just share some of these things personally for me and you know what it doesn't keep me forever i should have a daily experience with god every day i filled my car up with gas once and i've never had to do it again no every time it runs out of gas i got to put gas again every day should be a fresh walk with the lord jesus every day there should be something about your life every single day i woke up this world this morning with my mind stayed on jesus sometimes you're halfway down the road and say oh lord sorry i forgot to say good morning to you but it should be the other way around sitting at my kitchen table having lunch late lunch i got i got home from work nobody was home i was sitting there and something in my heart and i just spoke it out and i said lord is everything okay between me and you that's all i asked and i heard a noise and i look out to the window looking west i'm hearing a noise but there's there the tree there is not being moved but suddenly my back door the kitchen door opens and a little whirlwind is right there at the door just spinning like this and i look both right and it's the only place because this tree and that chair are not even moving and it opens the door just blew the door open and it stood there and then it just went out on its own and the peace that came with that because you know god works that way well he's done that many of times and he just said it's okay it's okay you might be going through some hard times in your life some of the hardest times are right here but then there's other things that are difficult think actual events is tough but god comes by and says my peace i give unto you not as the world gives it so not in a little pill it's not in a bottle it's not in this entertainment it's god in you that's the peace and another time sitting in my company van having lunch parked on the side road i look up and there's a little whirlwind coming down the street and the uh palo verdes had been began to drop all their little yellow leaves and it picked them up and it made a bouquet of little yellow leaves just coming down this way and it went around my van and then went on it didn't come through the van it just kind of went around it like it knew where it was going and what it was doing and again i just all i could do was say thank you lord you're mindful of me recognizing that god loves you god cares now you're saying well now brother aaron that should have been for a lady i'll tell you i'll take whatever god does for me if he wants to hand me a bouquet of flowers and this lord i'll gladly receive them just under realize that's how god is however he deals with you however he talks it whatever he makes known to you that should be in your life recognizing god is mindful of you he knows your name i've shared the times in the scripture when i asked him i said lord do you know my name do you know where i live those were the exact words and i sent them out loud i opened the bible in the false to psalms 115 if you'll pull that up i know i didn't give you psalms 1 15 verse 9. and i i don't remember mama had just said go go to the room when the girls were younger and there were six of them and one of me sometimes i just went to the room it was just sometimes easier and then there was sometimes they probably wish i'd gone to the room but this is what the lord took me o israel trust now in the lord he is their help and their shield o house of aaron trust in the lord he is their help and their shield ye that fear the lord trust in the lord so you can put your name in there ye that fear of the lord trust in the lord he is their help and their shield the lord has been mindful of us he will bless us he will bless the house of the house of israel he will bless the house of aaron i didn't write that he did luke chapter one oh one of the very last verses of luke chapter one i just didn't write these down my daughter elizabeth came to the room one of the very last verses there of chapter one of luke it may be the very last verse she comes up to me and she she's happy she's excited and she she says dad you know how you asked the lord if he knew where you lived and your name watch what he did for me let's go to luke chapter one and i don't know if they that's the first chapter of luke i believe that's the one maybe i've got the wrong one there but my daughter elizabeth she says i asked the lord and you took me and he said and her name was elizabeth and she's from the house of aaron and it's in there i probably have the wrong scripture but she showed it to me god didn't write it that moment it was there already but god unveiled it then he's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever there it is i'm sorry luke 1 5. i missed it by a few there was in the days of herod the king of judea a certain priest named zacharias of the course of abya and his wife was the daughter of aaron and her name was elizabeth now it does say wife but aaron elizabeth she said i asked the lord if he knew my name and where i was and that's exactly what he took me right to god is mindful god is aware and you have to be mindful and aware too not just that song that brother jordan just tied right in there and and again i say we don't sit down and discuss these and every once in a while i will ask the brothers or sister leila you know this song i plan to sing this song but so many times a song is sung or something has said a scripture is read a testimony is given ties right in so well that's what god does each one of you should have experiences like that in your life that god has done and you know god has done it for you it anchors it it makes it real to you it makes god mindful of you now the last quote and i was going to have the brothers play it and i forgot to name because it's fairly long but it's from the message he that is in you and it's the experience that brother branham has when he's up in the mountains in colorado and and he says how many experience have i had i pointed out to the brethren brother palmer and them in the places where the eagles you know i saw him rise up that day and you know that place where it all taken place in there it's a temperamental thing to me in there i've always had so many great experiences with my lord up in the mountains there should be a place in our lives set aside a time a place where we go and we mean business with god lord i'm setting this time aside i'm setting this place aside i'm nothing else you turn everything off maybe if it's in your room you tell your wife you tell children don't bother me for a while you know give me give me the quiet time i need to find god wherever that place is brother branham used to go to the cave places a different one brother green said he used to go when he would go and lock himself in that study room and lock the doors he knew to him that meant to god i'm not letting nothing interfere i need to hear from you brother branham is talking about this place he says i have so many great experience with my lord up there in the mountains you just can't go there without seeing him he's just everywhere so then as i i was there then the sleet started in the wind twisting like that and i said well i know the way down so i better get out of here right now so i said it looked down and i couldn't even see the bottoms no more them clouds were whirling around and twisting and sleep blowing and there it was the blizzard forecast for several days they knew it was coming they'd been telling them that storm was coming a a big blizzard coming brother tom is here brother tom simpson coming down from the canada heard the forecast and he was advised not to go through that part of the country because this forecast said it'll be blizzard where are you brother tom i think yeah right here the blizzard was coming everybody had done the set in for well i put my gun back under under my shirt like this my red shirt started walking down the mountain and as i started i got about a half a mile from the satellite oh my on that mountain just blowing i couldn't see the bottom no more i could see about 20 feet in front of me or 30 and i know to come right down this little what we call a little hog back little ridge then come off the creek and i know to follow the creek and where to go it got real bad i think he said quite a bit there now it got real bad emphasizing and yeah so then i get started and got about halfway down there and something said to me just as plain as you hear me stop and go back in the middle of a storm that's getting bad and something says stop and go back and when you had enough experience with him and he tells you stop and go back you don't question it you don't argue with him about it you've learned your lessons you turn you say yes lord he talks about that instant when the the plane is brought down in in tennessee because a sister was asking for god where's your elijah she identified herself with the scripture and said so if i identify with that scripture then there has to be an elijah for that time and god brings an airplane down and sends his his prophet the elijah of this day this time here to go down walking that way but didn't tell him why but he understood god said go so i go well i thought what was i thinking about maybe it's just my mind and we all have that sometimes was that just me you begin to question it is it and i just couldn't make another step forward david had fixed him his sandwich that morning and i think he tried to get even with me for fixing his daddy one one time of onion and honey and that's all we had so he fixed me a bologna you know i i don't know what it was wrapped up in there and i had it in my shirt and it then got wet through my shirt and i thought i'll just stop and eat this and maybe i'll be all right again so i pulled out the sandwich about 10 o'clock and i started eating this sandwich and as i and as i eat the sandwich i thought now i'll be all right and i started to move on but something said go back where you come from go back right through the storm half a mile more back up the mountain and into the dark timber where you can hardly see as far as that organ but i'm going to be an old man and i've been a christian along now for 33 years now for 33 years and i know no matter what how ridiculous it seems mind the lord do what the lord says and i turned back and went back to the saddle feeling my way back all the sleep getting harder and harder getting darker and darker and i sat down there and just put my coat up like this over my shirt over the scope again sat down i thought what am i doing here what why would i come back here you just got to take god at his word and trust him and when you've had an extra experience with him you trust him you wait on the lord and said yes lord he says and i just waited a few minutes it's hard to get up again and just as plain as i ever want to hear a voice said i am the creator of heavens and earth i make the winds and the rain i took off my hat he realized that i said great jehovah is that you he said i was the one who made the winds to cease upon the sea i was the one who made the waves go down i created heavens and earth was not was not i not the one that told you to speak to the for those squirrels and they came into existence i am god and i thank the lord that he reminds us sometimes he says wasn't that me wasn't that me and your life there didn't i do this for you wasn't that so he's just re-encouraging you he's not scolding you he's just trying to get you to understand it's me he says now when a voice speaks to you watch a scripture if it's not scriptural you leave it alone i don't care how plain it is you stay away from i said yes lord he said speak to those winds and storm and it will go away he didn't say tell me to say this he said you speak to the storm it's so easy to complain about a storm it's so easy to murmur about a storm but that's not what he said he said speak to the storm the storm of your own life the storm that's going between your ears sometimes the storm of the situation in your family speak to that storm i am the lord god that healeth all thy diseases he says speak to that storm that situation i own the cattle of a thousand hills is there anything too hard for the lord he begins to remind you who he is and what he does and he's telling you speak to that story and he says now the bible lays before me which my life is is in that and i raise up and i said i do not doubt your voice lord i said clouds snow rain sleet i resent your coming in the name of jesus christ go to your place i say that the sun must come out immediately and shine for four days till our hunting trip is over and i leave with my brethren it was just gushing like when whoosh like that it started going going whoosh and then it went just down to nothing stop i stood still my brethren up there are wondering what's happening in the sleep the rain stop there come a wind whirling around through the mountains lifted up the clouds one went this way east north west south and within a few minutes the sun was shining nice and warm that's the truth god knows that's truth i just stood there looking around with my hat off looking at i i say i got numb all over i thought the very god of creation it's all in his hands what what's he's telling me i picked up my gun wiped off the scope starting to walk go back down the hill and something said to me why don't you stroll with me through this wilderness walk with me was that for brother branham only was that for just the disciples i've heard that i was talking to a landlord and he asked me he saw my girls when they were little and he said what kind of christian are we going to tell him and he said well what do you believe i said i believe jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he stops me goes no no that was just for the disciples we went at it for a few minutes and i realized i wasn't going to change him but i also knew he wasn't going to change me because i had already experienced the lord and he began to tell me no that's why god gives us hospital psychiatrists and doctors today god doesn't do those things anymore i just said you're a little too late because god has done it for me you can't reason though you just have to stand because you know him to be true he says why don't you stroll with me through the windows walk with me i said yes lord with all my heart it'd be one of the greatest things i could do was walk with you so i put my gun over my shoulder and i started walking down through that never anaxilated to it virgin timber walking through here and as i did walk down along the game trails i felt like i believe i will go to the place there yesterday was our anniversary and i will stand there just a few minutes just as a little salute to mita because that's where he took her on their anniversary of their first wedding he said i couldn't afford an anniversary and i was going hunting so i took her to the mountains to go hunting with me okay brothers that's that's don't do don't do it okay where there's a little bunch of quaking aspen it was a little knob and i said i believe i'll go up there's a salute to our anniversary and they'll go back down the other side and the dark timbers walk around and go over by towards corral peaks and come back down that way and just walk in androids and i was saying father i know you're walking with me and what a privilege there is nobody greater that i could be walking with this the very god and the warm sunshine that god would love a sinner such as i and you you got to be willing to put your name in there and i think when he gets down and the rest of the quote there he gets down into to town and the gas station antenna says man it was a bad storm but it just disappeared all sudden brother bran really didn't didn't he doesn't elaborate to them what happened but he knew what it had taken place god is mindful of his children god loves his children but you have to recognize that for yourself brother sister a child that's old enough to begin to understand you've got to recognize that for yourself that god would stop the whole world for one of his children to meet that need there was daniel in the lion's den god said hold on a second we've got to go down let's put everything on the hole i got to go meet with him there's three three boys that get getting ready to get tossed into a furnace a fire and he says i'm not sending an angel down i'm going down there myself you've got to come to that place in your life they realize that god is mindful of you and he cares for you and you mean more to him than his own life he gave his life for me he gave and took my sin my iniquity my filth my everything and bore it himself so that i could have his righteousness and if he gives it to you he doesn't take it back he didn't put i said you're righteous if you meet these standards he didn't say if you can memorize x amount if you do x amount like many churches teach today this is how you earn his righteousness no he just said accept what i did for you transfer what you got give it to me and i'll give you what i got back to you well i i know who came up got the better half oh but he has a sea of god's forgetfulness that he just tosses it just tosses it just tosses it it's not there anymore ephesians chapter 3 verses 14 to 20. this is the word of god god inspired paul god inspired different uh vote different people to write to record to speak and have it recorded in our day they're able to physically record you can actually watch things happening live god has allowed all that to happen we'll have no excuse to sell god i didn't know because we do know paul says for this cause i bound my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ for this cause lord i love you amen i'm willing to give my all for you for all these things that you've done all the things that you will do the things you're doing it it's to god it's present to us sometimes we say that this and that but to god it's present of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named he didn't just say this is just for me but the whole family of god is named he says that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with with might by his spirit in the inner man that part inside of you that's god the seed gene of god and and it's hard sometimes to to understand that men but something in your heart better say amen to that there better be a response to that say yes lord that's you and me paul says that christ in you the hope of glory that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love love is the basis of it all because love produced grace and mercy and forgiveness and a willingness to say i love you you're my son you're my daughter see without love it re produces a law because he told them it says you chose to be like other countries you chose to be like other kingdoms you wanted a king to rule over you when i would have been your king i would have ruled with mercy and with love and with grace but you chose to go that way and because of that now look what you're doing but to us he says no grace is given to you mercy's given to you and that you may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breath and the length and the depth and the height is there depth in eternity is there breath in eternity breath and width is there length is there height no it's eternity it's immeasurable and and we can take and put all one word eternity but can you comprehend it that way no but that's just what it's eternal and to know the love of christ which passes knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of god how much does it take to have the fullness of god brother branham types it to a spoonful of ocean right he says all that's in a spoonful of ocean contains all the same qualities that all the ocean does christ in you is the hope of glory now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think he's able to do abundantly above all you hear the numbers that the the country the government is talking about right now uh the trillions of dollars there was a time when all of us and and still do would say boy if i could have a million but a million today and today's economy is just doesn't have that same value anymore there's houses now they're selling that where when i bought it it was 45 000 33 years ago and houses down the street now are selling for 300 000. they all do the same thing it's a house it has a roof it's a place to stay most of them have less yards most of them have there's a lot of things less less land with it now but the value has increased the value of the man has but go into houses now that in areas that were the desert and they're starting at half a million dollars and yeah half a million i'm not saying half a million dollars isn't a lot of money it but the value is different look talking about three and a half trillion dollars for this economy to do this to do that but god can take with one and do more than they could do with three and a half trillion brother branham says if god could get ten men who could totally humble themselves and give themselves over to god he could turn this world upside down amen with tim because it's not numbers with god he could take 300 with gideon and his men and go against an army that was much greater and destroy them he could take one man with his arms raised before a whole army and stop them and when another man they could say son stand still what can god do he's unlimited he says now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or thing according to the power that worketh in us paul's recognizing that for himself but it's in the scriptures as how you and i can recognize it for ourselves he is able more than able but he lives in me so therefore i can speak or do we have to wait till god speaks no he says i have put these words in your mouth i have given you that unction i've given you permission you say he tell brother branham speak to the mountain speak to the storm and too many to i uh brother the other day and he's a fine young brother just began a pastoring a church and they had been raised up in a way that the pastor he was raised under only he was the only brother that was writing this whole message everybody else was wrong so they were not allowed to listen to anybody else or anything well they've branched out they started a church on their own and he's been getting other ministers they've been they had mentioned to me that their pastor had told him to go ahead and start youtubing listening to other brothers and i said well that's good he goes well he told us that so that we could see how wrong everybody else was i said my he said but kind of backfired because the brother started hearing some brothers preaching the same thing but with the right spirit and saw the effectiveness of it two people can say no to you but the spirit behind one know can be totally different than the spirit behind the other no it has a different effect so he was telling he says have you ever heard brother green's testimony yeah i think so he had never heard it before because all he'd ever heard was how bad for the green was how long brother green was and he goes what a testimony that god would literally drive the car down from flagstaff down the mountain for him why he's still the same yesterday today and forever he doesn't change and to see what god does today but you have to be able to see it in your own life you have to be able to walk with god for yourself you have to be able to stand like the three hebrew young men i will go i will not bow down to that and i will cast myself in the furnace knowing that he can deliver but even if he doesn't choose to deliver i'm still not going to daniel you cannot pray and he said watch me i'll pray three times take a stand because you know god for yourself because you've experienced him for yourself and if it's you and god you're a majority and that has to come as a revelation you have to realize who you are you are a child of god oh yes so yes i'm a child of the king but again just going back you realize when you transferred when you said i accept your forgiveness you'll take all this filth and agree on me and you've placed your your hands on that sacrifice and he takes upon himself what you were but you have to realize then he gives you what he is and you are and you can't have one without the other you cannot have his righteousness without the confession of your sins and if you have the confessing and giving up of your sins then you receive his righteousness because if you don't then have no effect it had here you are a daughter a son of god and therefore heir of every promise god has ever given in his word take your inheritance and read about it study it read it get to know it see what belongs to you and you get a lawyer you get these uh the people and i know that brother peter works with some of this as they do i believe copyrights and stuff like that all the laws that are involved with that and what you have to understand when you're doing this but in a will the lawyers go through to it and they begin to look and they begin to tell this belongs to you and this belongs to you and they break it up but remember he's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and he doesn't talk to man about what he can do for me he tells me right here what he can do for me he takes care of it all when when when you hear some of the story some of the things that people do when it comes to the breaking of a will the reading of the will people who had never been there before never gone to church before but there's going to be a will written that day they're going to come to see if their name's there you know maybe they haven't seen their parents or had anything to do with grandpa and grandma but the will is going to be read today boy they make a special effort to be there that day but every service the will of god is brought forth we should be willing to come and say lord i want to hear more about what you've done for me the musicians would come up this power yes but i don't know if these words were sufficient enough to to get the thought across of who we are we've come we've confessed our sins our iniquities all all oh my sometimes we could spend an hour just trying to pour out how bad we are but you just said just for us to do it confess to place our hands on the sacrifice to give our all to and you would take it upon yourself that goat that the blood was sprinkled and went out and and was gone out on his own taking it away from the from the congregation that was you but the innocent life of that goat could not return it just carried over for another year but the life of god returns back to dwell to inhabit the one who has confessed the one who has placed his hands her hands on the sacrifice and confessed and therefore you receive the life of god the righteousness of god and you're a child of god lord help us to understand that believe that and to express our love back to our desire back to you lord jesus
