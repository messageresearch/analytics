[11:15] of the lord this morning this evening
[11:17] amen
[11:18] and that's brother john's unbrewing if
[11:20] you just come and open the service in a
[11:22] word of prayer here in a moment let's
[11:24] just stand this evening
[11:28] had only one request brought
[11:30] mentioned
[11:32] brother aaron mentioned before service
[11:33] that brother david savala's wife sister
[11:35] naomi has covered and it's been going
[11:38] through maybe their church a little bit
[11:39] of people back there
[11:41] so let's just remember them in prayer
[11:43] this evening i'm sure each one of us
[11:45] have a need
[11:47] in our hearts amen
[11:49] i know sometimes i say when we invite
[11:51] the brothers to come up to pray may they
[11:53] speak to the lord on our behalf but
[11:55] tonight maybe just a little differently
[11:57] as brother john prays maybe just each
[11:59] one of you just praying your way to the
[12:01] lord as well and i know we do that but
[12:04] maybe make that more intentional tonight
[12:06] and just not just let the brother up
[12:08] here that's praying but let's just each
[12:10] speak to the lord in our own way amen
[12:13] god bless you brother john
[12:17] [Music]
[12:19] be
[12:19] before we go to the lord
[12:22] and i've talked to a few of you
[12:25] of a project that i want to do
[12:29] and it kind of goes along with
[12:32] the number of holocaust victims
[12:36] world war ii
[12:39] soldiers who
[12:40] who fought for
[12:43] our freedom
[12:45] as time goes on
[12:47] many
[12:48] of the testimonies that we do have and
[12:52] this is
[12:53] you know
[12:54] i i didn't see the
[12:56] service today i
[12:58] usually put that off to monday
[13:04] my project that i would like to do
[13:07] and i don't know if it's of the lord
[13:10] you know i didn't get
[13:12] a voice or a sign
[13:14] but it's something on my heart
[13:17] that everybody here
[13:19] has a testimony
[13:22] some have great testimonies
[13:25] and this is only
[13:28] how we
[13:31] as humans judge things you know there's
[13:33] a little white sin and there's a you
[13:36] know a big
[13:37] big black sin okay
[13:39] but it's all sin
[13:42] testimony no matter how small
[13:46] or how big
[13:48] is a testimony to somebody
[13:50] [Music]
[13:52] you know even if it's just somebody came
[13:54] up to you and said
[13:56] god bless
[13:59] i'd like to get
[14:01] testimonies
[14:03] from all of you
[14:06] i'll need some help
[14:07] and the help is
[14:10] how do i take these testimonies
[14:14] that i get and i hear
[14:18] and distribute them out
[14:22] to all of you
[14:25] okay
[14:26] um
[14:30] so pray about it if you have an idea
[14:32] no matter
[14:34] how old you are
[14:36] i'm open
[14:38] uh for that we can even have it here
[14:42] a couple copies of this
[14:46] and it would be
[14:47] easy for me
[14:49] that if you wrote it down you just have
[14:51] to write it down
[14:53] that i would
[14:56] type it up
[14:58] okay
[14:59] that's my project
[15:01] that's my project and i hope
[15:04] it is of god
[15:06] and gives us
[15:07] uplifting no matter
[15:09] how small the testimony that you know
[15:13] is
[15:15] so
[15:16] i've talked to a few
[15:17] people
[15:19] brothers and sisters
[15:21] about that
[15:23] and just
[15:24] this week it's really gotten more
[15:27] on my heart
[15:30] so

[36:18] that so well is because heather and i
[36:20] were in that service and we had our
[36:22] firstborn little boy with us he was 21
[36:25] days old at that point
[36:27] he was born in new zealand but we
[36:28] brought him all the way here
[36:30] and he was dedicated that same morning
[36:33] so i just i just wanted to share that
[36:35] that little testimony but it's it's that
[36:38] we've had this place of worship for half
[36:40] a century
[36:41] and this building in addition to the
[36:43] years we spent in the other building
[36:46] but but one of the songs that we sing i
[36:48] remember brother fred barker was here
[36:50] and he had a song of course hallelujah
[36:52] we've all sung the hallelujah chorus
[36:54] right so but where does this word
[36:56] hallelujah come from and that's what got
[36:57] me to thinking
[36:59] dangerous
[37:01] okay so uh
[37:03] brother if you put up the revelation 19
[37:05] scripture revelation 19 6-7
[37:10] it says because this is relating to us
[37:13] today tonight
[37:15] he says i heard as it were the voice of
[37:18] a great multitude
[37:20] and as the voice of many waters that's
[37:22] people right that's a lot of people
[37:24] right and as the voice of mighty
[37:26] thunderings
[37:28] they weren't soft-spoken
[37:30] saying hallelujah
[37:33] hallelujah that's that's a a greek um
[37:38] phonetic expression of a hebrew word
[37:40] alleluia for the lord god omnipotent
[37:43] reigneth let us be glad
[37:46] and rejoice that's why we're here
[37:48] tonight
[37:49] and give honor to him
[37:51] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[37:53] and his wife hath made herself ready and
[37:54] that's what we're doing
[37:57] is making ourselves ready
[38:00] this word alleluia
[38:02] what does it mean we say that
[38:05] what does it actually mean
[38:07] so i i had to look it up
[38:10] and and
[38:11] halal
[38:12] is praise it's it's a hebrew word
[38:15] halal's praise and when there's an ooh
[38:17] in something in hebrew like that is a
[38:20] suffix hebrew it's a very compact
[38:22] language
[38:23] both written and spoken so
[38:25] alai
[38:26] halalu
[38:28] the the makes it as an us or a we so it
[38:31] could be we praise or it could be praise
[38:35] hour okay but what is the yah and we say
[38:38] well that's an abbreviation for the
[38:40] yudhi vaave the jehovah it's
[38:43] americans use abbreviations in english
[38:45] we use abbreviations a lot of languages
[38:48] don't use abbreviations for things so
[38:50] what what what's going on here so that
[38:52] brought us to psalm 68
[38:55] verses 3 and 4.
[39:00] david says let the righteous
[39:03] by his blood
[39:05] be sad and no be glad
[39:09] and let them mourn and
[39:13] rejoice
[39:15] before god yay
[39:18] let them exceedingly rejoice
[39:21] not just a little bit
[39:23] sing unto god
[39:26] sing praises
[39:28] to his name
[39:30] extol that means to raise up put him on
[39:33] a pedestal
[39:35] extol him that rideth upon the heavens
[39:38] by his name
[39:41] yeah
[39:42] by his it's not an abbreviation
[39:46] so alleluia
[39:48] is praise our god
[39:50] we praise god it's not a con
[39:52] so if you ever hear the word hallelujah
[39:55] now you know it's derivation you know
[39:57] what it means you know where it came
[39:58] from by his name yah and rejoice before
[40:01] him and that brings me to the psalm that
[40:03] i want to share with you
[40:06] less than an hour less than an hour
[40:08] brother my friends maybe even less than
[40:11] a half hour
[40:13] and it's psalm 150. i i was sitting in
[40:15] the pew there this morning and i was
[40:18] reading that and i shared with you
[40:20] sister grace a little bit after service
[40:22] about it because i saw you in it
[40:24] and and i saw you in it and i saw you in
[40:28] it and so let's this this is a psalm
[40:32] that's about praise it's a last psalm
[40:34] it's the closing psalm in the book of
[40:36] psalms and it answers four
[40:39] key questions if you read a book
[40:41] sometimes you think well what's the plot
[40:43] the who what where why and how well this
[40:46] deals with the where the what the how
[40:49] and the who so it answers four questions
[40:52] about praise first verse
[40:55] praise ye the lord that sounds like a
[40:57] commandment to me not even a suggestion
[41:01] praise god
[41:02] in his sanctuary
[41:05] praise him in the firmament of his power
[41:09] so where where is the firmament of his
[41:12] power that's another way of saying
[41:14] everywhere there's no place you can be
[41:17] that it's
[41:18] inappropriate to praise the lord
[41:21] praise him everywhere
[41:24] everywhere like you said brother never
[41:26] lose your enthusiasm for the coming of
[41:28] the lord praise him everywhere
[41:32] for what
[41:33] verse two praise him for his mighty acts
[41:37] okay
[41:39] praise him according
[41:42] to his excellent greatness
[41:45] not just for the acts not just
[41:48] for what he's done but according to his
[41:51] excellent greatness
[41:53] in other words
[41:55] praise
[41:56] should be enthusiastic
[41:59] not pulling
[42:01] it should be enthusiastic
[42:04] well how let's go to verse 3
[42:07] praise him with the sound of the trumpet
[42:09] i think the sax also qualifies here
[42:11] brother
[42:13] as does the clarinet
[42:15] not just the trumpet but uh your son
[42:18] plays the trumpet i remember in the
[42:19] mariachi and you do too then my brother
[42:21] noel once upon a time played the trumpet
[42:23] but anyway and
[42:25] anyway praise it with the psaltery
[42:27] what's the psaltery it's it's it's the
[42:29] liar if you've seen these little string
[42:31] things from ancient drawings way back
[42:34] yeah
[42:35] and the harp okay
[42:37] first four praise him with the timbrel
[42:39] that's i look that up that's tambourine
[42:42] sometimes we do that and dance
[42:46] well we haven't gotten there yet
[42:49] i've been to some churches where they've
[42:50] gotten there
[42:52] someday
[42:53] we'll get there one of these days i'll
[42:55] fall flat on my face in front of you and
[42:56] i'll get there too
[42:59] okay but we should praise him with
[43:02] stringed instruments sister liliana
[43:05] you're in that psalm you're fulfilling
[43:07] that psalm every service that you're
[43:08] here
[43:11] sister martha
[43:12] sister lydia
[43:14] all of you that share in that way
[43:17] where's brother
[43:19] matthew with guitar
[43:21] okay
[43:23] praise and whispering instruments and
[43:25] organs again sister grace and brother
[43:28] matthew
[43:29] and brother arnie
[43:31] the harmonica qualifies too that's a
[43:33] mouth organ right
[43:36] verse 5 praise him upon the loud symbols
[43:40] that might be a little enthusiastic for
[43:42] some of us praise them on the high
[43:43] sounding symbols but if we lack the
[43:45] symbols
[43:47] we've got these
[43:49] right and we can praise the lord
[43:54] verse six and brother lyle will get
[43:56] quiet and sit down
[43:58] who
[44:00] who are the ones that should praise the
[44:02] lord that should praise him everywhere
[44:03] that should praise him with enthusiasm
[44:05] who are the ones let everything that
[44:08] hath
[44:09] breath
[44:11] praise the lord
[44:13] praise ye the lord is anyone here
[44:15] breathing
[44:18] okay
[44:19] we talk about the promises of god
[44:21] there's also the commandments of god
[44:24] it's not a suggestion
[44:26] it's a commandment
[44:28] praise the lord
[44:34] [Applause]
[44:37] amen
[44:39] amen brother matthew mcfadden do you
[44:41] have a song special i just realized that
[44:43] you did and i wasn't thinking through
[44:45] that so
[44:46] let's i wrote that down so let's have
[44:48] you come up this right this time brother
[44:50] peter if you could help out there in the
[44:52] booth that would be great let's stand
[44:54] and sing this song i am blessed i am
[44:56] blessed every day that i live
[44:58] i am blessed i was thinking of this
[45:00] before he said anything so we should be
[45:02] able to sing this amen
[45:07] i am blessed
[45:10] i am blessed
[45:13] i am blessed
[45:17] every day that i live i am blessed
[45:23] when i wake up in the morning till i lay
[45:28] my head to rest i am blessed
[45:33] i am blessed
[45:36] i am blessed
[45:39] i am blessed
[45:42] every day that i live i am blessed
[45:48] when i wake up in the morning till i lay
[45:53] my head to rest i am blessed
[45:58] i am blessed one more time
[46:01] i am blessed
[46:04] i am
[46:06] blessed every day
[46:09] that i live i am blessed
[46:14] when i wake up in the morning till i lay
[46:18] my head to rest i am blessed
[46:23] i am blessed
[46:27] amen you may be seated
[46:29] a flat
[46:38] just a quick
[46:41] testimony i was sort of
[46:43] i wasn't sure what to say or sometimes
[46:45] you're just sitting there thinking about
[46:47] what's god done for me and i i realized
[46:50] i i hadn't
[46:52] i couldn't think of anything
[46:54] in particular
[46:56] and then
[46:58] so i was putting some thoughts down in
[46:59] the back but the last few weeks at work
[47:02] have been kind of um stressful i took a
[47:04] new position i've started new hours you
[47:07] i don't know when i'll be back on
[47:09] wednesday night but we'll just put it up
[47:10] to god because i was talking to jordan
[47:13] earlier
[47:14] it's not that you notice on wednesday
[47:16] that you need to be there
[47:18] but when you get the next sunday you
[47:19] start to realize that you're just
[47:22] you're just feeling pretty dry
[47:24] so
[47:26] i just want to put that before the lord
[47:28] and
[47:29] and
[47:32] so
[47:34] i realized
[47:35] the last few weeks i just i'd had a lot
[47:37] of
[47:39] worries and just stress
[47:41] from dealing with the new position
[47:43] just the work is
[47:45] it's different you know
[47:47] now i'm dealing with
[47:48] supervising so it's less about me being
[47:51] able to accomplish my job quickly and
[47:53] it's more about
[47:54] managing people to get their job done
[47:57] quickly and correctly and it's just a
[47:59] totally different
[48:01] way of
[48:02] [Music]
[48:05] of trying to to get things done and you
[48:08] know you can't be a dictator you gotta
[48:12] you know you gotta be real positive and
[48:14] i already had one incident where i
[48:21] if you know me personally you know i can
[48:23] be pretty quick with people and i i was
[48:24] not i had a very light touch with
[48:26] someone and there was tears and i was
[48:28] like
[48:30] so it was just a funny
[48:33] just different everything was different
[48:35] and then i was
[48:37] um
[48:39] so there's this one night i get home and
[48:41] i'm just
[48:43] thinking about all the problems at work
[48:45] and
[48:47] just it seemed insurmountable and just
[48:49] difficult
[48:52] and then i would just
[48:55] it was one of those moments where i just
[48:57] had this thought that i was just when
[48:59] was the last time i was this worried
[49:00] about
[49:02] walking with god and praying and reading
[49:04] my bible
[49:06] and so it was just this beautiful moment
[49:08] where
[49:09] god was showing me
[49:11] you know how to
[49:12] you know
[49:13] you let this
[49:14] you know you've been
[49:16] just kind of winging it or just letting
[49:18] things go by for how long
[49:20] and when was the last time you were
[49:21] worried about
[49:23] getting
[49:24] you know
[49:26] coming correctly to church and different
[49:28] things and i was just
[49:29] it was a it was a good moment
[49:32] this song is one i'd heard
[49:34] a couple years ago and i don't know if i
[49:36] ever sang it for you guys
[49:38] um
[49:39] but it just came back to mind and i
[49:42] have really enjoyed it so i hope this is
[49:44] a good song for you
[49:46] to sing
[49:49] [Music]
[50:00] out of the desks i cried here
[50:06] [Music]
[50:12] we'll get it sorry
[50:30] [Music]
[50:38] alright
[50:40] out of the depths
[50:43] i cry to you
[50:47] in darkest places i will call
[50:54] incline your ear to me anew
[50:59] and hear my cry
[51:02] for mercy lord
[51:04] [Music]
[51:06] were you to count
[51:09] my sinful ways
[51:12] how could i come before your throne
[51:18] yet for
[51:19] forgiveness meets my gaze
[51:23] i stand redeemed by grace alone

[51:42] i will wait for you
[51:46] surely wait for
[51:48] you until my soul

[52:25] on your word

[52:49] and god himself has paid the price
[52:54] that all who trust in him today
[52:59] find healing in his sacrifice
[53:04] well i will wait for you
[53:07] i will wait for you
[53:10] all your word

[55:55] be where he is
[55:56] it's good to have his promises
[55:59] i really enjoy services like this but
[56:01] it's also
[56:03] a little bit
[56:04] nerve-racking when you try to think well
[56:07] what do i say what do i
[56:09] what do i sing but
[56:12] the problem isn't
[56:14] that we don't have anything to sing
[56:16] about or anything to say the problem is
[56:17] we've got so much
[56:19] that you know how
[56:22] we're going to have eternity to praise
[56:24] him
[56:25] and to share testimonies and
[56:27] and
[56:28] it's it's gonna be wonderful
[56:30] but just uh
[56:32] i've got kind of a couple
[56:34] testimonies ones
[56:36] a little bit longer one two are kind of
[56:37] short and then my wife and i did
[56:40] practice a song
[56:41] uh together so
[56:43] once the testimonies are done we'll
[56:45] we'll end with the song but
[56:47] um
[56:49] a couple of testimonies they're really
[56:51] related to this trip we just got back
[56:53] from
[56:54] and
[56:56] it was a long trip so i couldn't say
[56:58] everything but
[56:59] three three things that i'd like to say
[57:02] one of them i was thinking
[57:04] and
[57:06] um
[57:07] tomorrow is zion's 11 month
[57:10] birthday and so it's just about a year
[57:13] ago
[57:14] that lydia was very pregnant and very
[57:18] sore in her back and very unable to walk
[57:21] and you know when you're in the middle
[57:23] of those things and you're in the middle
[57:24] of those valleys it just seems like
[57:27] it could go on forever
[57:28] you know is is this the rest of our life
[57:31] is this the way it's gonna be
[57:34] um
[57:35] but
[57:37] i know so many of you prayed and so many
[57:40] showed your care in so many ways
[57:43] but then just looking
[57:46] where we've come since then
[57:48] we were able to take this trip that
[57:51] you know if you don't have your health
[57:53] you can have all the money in the world
[57:54] which we don't but you could have all
[57:56] the money in the world and you wouldn't
[57:57] be able to enjoy a trip like we were
[58:00] able to do you know and
[58:02] by god's grace we're able to take this
[58:05] trip for
[58:06] a long time through many countries
[58:08] and
[58:09] lydia was able to walk
[58:12] she was able to walk everywhere we we
[58:14] rarely had a car mostly we were taking
[58:16] the buses and we were walking
[58:18] and we're
[58:20] we
[58:21] we just carried what we could carry on
[58:23] our back
[58:24] and so on travel days lydia would have
[58:26] zion uh she would be holding him and
[58:28] then on her back she'd have two
[58:29] backpacks and i'd have two backpacks and
[58:31] i'd be carrying
[58:33] jonas and abel would be walking with his
[58:34] backpack and
[58:36] it's a lot
[58:38] but by god's grace she was able to do it
[58:41] and
[58:42] that's a miracle to me that's
[58:47] you know
[58:48] the trip was good but the fact that
[58:50] she's
[58:51] healed that her back is strong
[58:54] i couldn't thank the lord enough for
[58:56] that
[58:57] and so i just want to thank him for that
[58:59] and
[59:01] so here's that was one of the short ones
[59:03] there's another real short one when i'm
[59:04] calling lydia up i'll tell you that one
[59:06] but here's the longer one
[59:08] and it's one that i believe
[59:10] is still
[59:11] ongoing i don't know the end of this
[59:13] testimony
[59:15] but i was so excited and encouraged by
[59:18] it
[59:18] and basically what happened i'll try to
[59:21] make it short but we're on our way to
[59:23] israel
[59:24] we're going to dallas which is a very
[59:27] busy airport many people very
[59:30] busy
[59:31] and we caught we were just passing by
[59:34] these people you passed by so many
[59:35] people but they looked like us it was a
[59:37] man and a woman probably in their
[59:39] 50s or so
[59:41] but
[59:42] you know you can you can tell a
[59:44] christian a lot of times when you pass
[59:46] them and so lydia smiled and said hello
[59:48] and we passed by and that could have
[59:50] been it
[59:50] that's often the way it is it's just
[59:53] past them but they came around and found
[59:55] us
[59:56] and they said hey where are you going
[59:57] and and so we got to talking and it was
[59:59] really nice we said we're going to
[1:00:00] israel
[1:00:02] and they said well we've got if you're
[1:00:04] going to israel
[1:00:05] and you're a christian which we'd
[1:00:07] established there were both christians
[1:00:08] they said you've got to look this guy up
[1:00:10] he's our friend
[1:00:12] he said yeah sure that's
[1:00:14] that would be great
[1:00:16] and so we were able to get his contact
[1:00:18] information and we didn't know anything
[1:00:19] about him but that he was a christian
[1:00:21] and he lived in israel
[1:00:22] and we had his name and then
[1:00:25] later we didn't get his contact
[1:00:27] information right away but eventually we
[1:00:29] were able to get his contact information
[1:00:32] and
[1:00:33] so didn't really know anything about him
[1:00:34] but just believed that there was a
[1:00:36] reason that the lord had us
[1:00:38] run into him
[1:00:40] and then we're in israel for a while
[1:00:42] and uh one one little testimony we got
[1:00:45] to visit the church in tel aviv
[1:00:47] and a beautiful little church just a
[1:00:51] good spirit
[1:00:52] and we didn't know you know what to
[1:00:55] if we should sing or not but we ended up
[1:00:57] singing that song that i sing sometimes
[1:01:00] may the blood of jesus speak for me
[1:01:02] and i almost didn't but then i just we
[1:01:05] ended up doing it and then the brother
[1:01:07] the pastor gets up to speak
[1:01:09] and he's speaking on the voice of the
[1:01:11] blood
[1:01:12] can you imagine
[1:01:14] we had no idea and so
[1:01:16] we just felt that the lord
[1:01:19] was with us and was mindful of us and
[1:01:21] that he had allowed this and that they
[1:01:23] were there for a reason
[1:01:24] and so
[1:01:27] talking to our brother
[1:01:28] the pastor there in israel he said that
[1:01:31] it's
[1:01:31] it's a difficult place spiritually
[1:01:34] because of course you've got all the the
[1:01:35] people that are holding to the jewish
[1:01:38] faith as they understand it and
[1:01:40] the other people holding to the islamic
[1:01:43] faith
[1:01:44] and and so there's
[1:01:46] this kind of battle there but then even
[1:01:49] among the people that should be
[1:01:50] christians and should be
[1:01:52] you know very different from everyone
[1:01:54] else
[1:01:55] a lot of the christians there in they
[1:01:57] call the messianic communities
[1:02:00] they'll be friendly and everything to
[1:02:02] you until the point that they find out
[1:02:04] that you don't believe the trinity like
[1:02:06] they do
[1:02:07] and at that point there's actually a
[1:02:09] great division
[1:02:10] that
[1:02:12] not not from our side but
[1:02:15] from other groups
[1:02:17] that's that's kind of a non-negotiable
[1:02:19] thing if you want to be their friend
[1:02:21] and so it was interesting to hear that
[1:02:23] because
[1:02:24] i didn't know that
[1:02:26] and so finally towards the end of our
[1:02:27] trip we got we got in contact with this
[1:02:30] man that we got the number from the
[1:02:31] houston airport we said well
[1:02:33] can we meet up for coffee
[1:02:36] he said come on over to my house
[1:02:38] i thought okay this is
[1:02:39] could be really good or could be really
[1:02:41] awkward
[1:02:43] and lydia's like well you know we've got
[1:02:44] the kids and he could be really old and
[1:02:47] maybe it's not a great place for kids
[1:02:49] and that's we just went we just felt to
[1:02:51] go
[1:02:53] and and so you know you have the
[1:02:54] nervousness when you go someplace you've
[1:02:56] never been especially to meet somebody
[1:02:58] you've never met
[1:02:59] but what was amazing is how quickly when
[1:03:02] we got to his house all that was gone
[1:03:05] it was amazing how quickly we felt
[1:03:08] at home in a way that we had not felt at
[1:03:10] home
[1:03:12] in a long while
[1:03:14] except for with our brother there the
[1:03:16] pastor
[1:03:18] and
[1:03:20] we could just
[1:03:21] there was a sweetness about them
[1:03:24] there was an atmosphere about them
[1:03:26] i thought wow this is
[1:03:28] this is pretty good just from somebody
[1:03:29] you meet at an airport
[1:03:31] and so
[1:03:32] we got to talk with him and we talked a
[1:03:34] long time and so i can't
[1:03:36] tell everything but just to tell his
[1:03:38] testimony a little bit which was such a
[1:03:40] blessing to me
[1:03:41] is that this man that we met was just
[1:03:44] raised a kind of secular semi-religious
[1:03:47] jew
[1:03:49] and he ended up
[1:03:52] becoming interested in this woman that's
[1:03:54] now his wife
[1:03:55] and he didn't know that she believed in
[1:03:58] jesus he just thought she was a jew too
[1:04:00] and so he's trying to get to know her
[1:04:02] and she says well you know you've
[1:04:04] got to
[1:04:05] you've got to come to church you know i
[1:04:07] believe in jesus and so he
[1:04:11] he didn't want that
[1:04:13] but it was for him
[1:04:15] and she got him to
[1:04:17] um
[1:04:18] to look at the bible and he said when he
[1:04:20] opened the bible
[1:04:21] he could see the words and moving on the
[1:04:23] page
[1:04:24] and he said i think her name's christina
[1:04:27] he said this book is a lie
[1:04:29] and she said yeah that's what i've been
[1:04:30] trying to tell you
[1:04:32] and so
[1:04:33] he became a christian
[1:04:35] he felt the lord lead him
[1:04:37] and
[1:04:38] he he wanted to be baptized then
[1:04:41] and so he was baptized and he said he
[1:04:44] nobody really told him this but he had
[1:04:46] this
[1:04:48] this witness in himself that he felt
[1:04:50] that when he would be baptized
[1:04:52] everything would be changed that he
[1:04:54] would be different
[1:04:55] and he said he was baptized in the name
[1:04:57] of the father and of the son
[1:04:59] and of the holy ghost the way that they
[1:05:01] baptized in in these messianic groups
[1:05:04] and he said everything was the same
[1:05:06] he had no change and so he he was still
[1:05:09] seeking
[1:05:10] and
[1:05:12] he saw through different churches for 10
[1:05:14] years
[1:05:16] until finally he came to somebody that
[1:05:18] could explain to him baptism in the name
[1:05:20] of the lord jesus christ
[1:05:22] and he said
[1:05:24] when he was baptized this was his third
[1:05:26] time to be baptized because he had been
[1:05:28] he tried it again in the titles finally
[1:05:30] on his third time 10 years later
[1:05:33] he was baptized in the name of the lord
[1:05:34] jesus and he said he received the holy
[1:05:36] ghost
[1:05:38] and
[1:05:41] they believe
[1:05:43] they believe in one god
[1:05:45] we explain to them what we believe
[1:05:48] about the godhead and they said that's
[1:05:49] how we believe it
[1:05:51] and
[1:05:53] and it was such a confirmation because
[1:05:55] it would have been so sad to feel like
[1:05:57] we were brothers
[1:05:59] and then to get to the trinity and have
[1:06:00] that separation that i was kind of
[1:06:02] expecting but no we were able to just
[1:06:05] rejoice
[1:06:07] in
[1:06:08] in the fulfillment of that promise that
[1:06:10] if you're baptized in the name of the
[1:06:11] lord jesus
[1:06:12] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:06:15] and there was such a fellowship there
[1:06:17] and
[1:06:18] he said he's got a group there that he
[1:06:20] fellowships with about 120 people that
[1:06:23] that's how they believe
[1:06:24] they're many of them are jewish they're
[1:06:27] over there
[1:06:29] they believe baptism of the holy ghost
[1:06:30] they believe baptism in the name of the
[1:06:32] lord jesus but here's the funny thing
[1:06:35] is they live about half an hour from our
[1:06:37] brother that's a pastor over there and
[1:06:39] they've never known about each other
[1:06:41] so maybe
[1:06:43] two takeaways from this
[1:06:46] testimony god is doing great things
[1:06:50] and the second
[1:06:52] a lot of times we don't know about it
[1:06:54] it can be just
[1:06:56] half an hour away
[1:06:59] but see we only know about the things
[1:07:01] that we need to know about a lot of
[1:07:02] times
[1:07:03] and i believe that things are happening
[1:07:06] and i believe
[1:07:08] salvation will quickly turn to the jews
[1:07:10] and i don't know if this
[1:07:12] how this plays into that
[1:07:15] but just because you don't see things
[1:07:16] going on doesn't mean they're not going
[1:07:18] on that's true god's moving he he has
[1:07:21] people and and what was really cool
[1:07:23] is um
[1:07:25] we had just before we got to meet this
[1:07:27] brother
[1:07:28] we just driven through mount carmel
[1:07:32] where you've got the the mount carmel
[1:07:33] showdown and you've got elijah
[1:07:36] and then right after that elijah says
[1:07:37] well
[1:07:38] you know i'm the only one lord
[1:07:42] and then it says
[1:07:44] if you read there
[1:07:45] it says there's seven thousand that have
[1:07:47] not bowed their knees to baal
[1:07:49] right and i believe god's still doing
[1:07:51] that he's still reserving a people to
[1:07:53] himself that are not bowing
[1:07:55] to the doctrines of man the thoughts of
[1:07:58] man
[1:07:58] but he's keeping a people
[1:08:00] true to himself and nobody needs to know
[1:08:03] who those people are but god himself
[1:08:07] and just let us
[1:08:08] be part of that number but it was a real
[1:08:11] encouragement to us just to know that
[1:08:13] the lord was doing that and he didn't
[1:08:15] have to show us but he just let us
[1:08:18] experience that amen that if we were to
[1:08:21] have a list of things that we'd like to
[1:08:22] see in christian israel of course we
[1:08:24] want to see the places
[1:08:26] but if we could see real christians in
[1:08:28] israel
[1:08:29] that would be the thing that we'd want
[1:08:30] to see the most and we got to see it by
[1:08:32] god's grace just by what you could call
[1:08:35] a chance encounter in the houston
[1:08:36] airport but i believe there was a reason
[1:08:39] for it
[1:08:40] and so that was a real blessing so if
[1:08:42] my wife would come as i tell the third
[1:08:45] testimony was that
[1:08:47] we were
[1:08:48] in oslo which is in norway and they say
[1:08:51] that it's kind of the
[1:08:53] the most crooked
[1:08:55] greedy place in norway
[1:08:57] and
[1:08:58] lydia has her phone with her credit
[1:09:00] cards and
[1:09:01] everything all in the phone case her
[1:09:03] driver's license and she left this phone
[1:09:06] in the
[1:09:07] in the bathroom at the main train
[1:09:09] station in oslo
[1:09:11] and with some people from around there
[1:09:13] and we said well we lost this we left it
[1:09:15] there
[1:09:16] and the one was not a believer right now
[1:09:18] he said it's gone you'll never see that
[1:09:21] again
[1:09:22] but the other was a believer he said oh
[1:09:24] i do that all the time and let's go look
[1:09:26] for it you know he was he had a good the
[1:09:28] two had two totally different reactions
[1:09:30] to it
[1:09:31] the one these were brothers
[1:09:33] one brother said it's gone
[1:09:35] sorry for use thinks to be you the other
[1:09:38] said oh it's it's okay
[1:09:40] and by god's grace we went and found it
[1:09:42] and everything was there
[1:09:43] and
[1:09:44] it was a small thing but
[1:09:46] god's mindful despair that falls he's
[1:09:48] mindful of the little details
[1:09:51] it was such a blessing and encouragement
[1:09:53] to us
[1:09:54] so
[1:09:54] uh we're gonna try to sing the song
[1:09:56] lydia says i have to tell you we didn't
[1:09:58] get a chance to really practice it so i
[1:10:00] guess we're supposed to blame it on that
[1:10:01] if if i mess up here
[1:10:09] but god bless you
[1:10:42] yes
[1:11:02] [Music]
[1:11:13] we were wandering in the desert
[1:11:16] with our souls so starved and weak
[1:11:20] we were hungry for a homeland
[1:11:23] we did not know how to see it
[1:11:26] but we lifted up our voices
[1:11:29] to the only one who hears
[1:11:33] and the god of mercy came brought us
[1:11:39] we near locked out of the garden
[1:11:42] our backs bent down in pain
[1:11:46] in the shadow of death's darkness
[1:11:49] we were slaves to sin and blame
[1:11:52] and we cried out in our labor
[1:11:55] to the only one who hears
[1:11:58] and the god of mercy wiped away our
[1:12:02] tears
[1:12:04] oh give thanks to the lord for his love
[1:12:08] endures forever we were wandering and
[1:12:12] lost and our father brought us home
[1:12:16] to our safe dwelling place to a feast of
[1:12:20] joy and laughter
[1:12:22] o give thanks to the lord for he is good
[1:12:28] we were fools in our rebellion
[1:12:31] in a hunger strike of pride
[1:12:34] we were sick and growing closer to the
[1:12:38] death we should have died
[1:12:40] then he heard of our rebellion
[1:12:43] and he called us all by names and the
[1:12:46] god of glory took
[1:12:48] away our shame
[1:12:52] oh give thanks to the lord for his love
[1:12:56] endures forever we were wandering and
[1:13:00] lost and our father brought us home to
[1:13:04] our safe dwelling place to a feast of
[1:13:08] joy and laughter or give thanks to the
[1:13:11] lord for he is good
[1:13:15] we were far out on the ocean
[1:13:18] making wealth and chasing dreams but the
[1:13:22] waves of great destruction
[1:13:24] brought us trembling to our knees then
[1:13:27] we cried like drunken sailors to the
[1:13:30] only one who hears and the god of
[1:13:34] comfort took away our tears
[1:13:38] so give thanks to the lord for his love
[1:13:42] endures forever we were wandering and
[1:13:45] lost and our father brought us home to a
[1:13:50] safe dwelling place to a feast of joy
[1:13:54] and laughter o give thanks to the lord
[1:13:57] he is
[1:13:58] good o give thanks to the lord for his
[1:14:03] love endures forever we were wandering
[1:14:07] and lost and our father brought us home
[1:14:11] to a safe dwelling place to a feast of
[1:14:15] joy and laughter o give thanks to the
[1:14:18] lord for he is good
[1:14:22] amen
[1:14:36] amen does anyone have a testimony they
[1:14:38] would like to share
[1:14:40] sister nina you want to come up here or
[1:14:42] you want us to bring a mic to you
[1:14:45] okay well
[1:14:46] if you want to come up front
[1:14:58] this is such a nice service just to hear
[1:15:00] what the lord
[1:15:01] is doing and how he leads his people and
[1:15:03] just shows his kindness i just wanted to
[1:15:06] share this um as quickly as i could
[1:15:08] about stephen and i'm moving here um
[1:15:11] so
[1:15:12] about a year ago we knew we were going
[1:15:14] to come well before that but about a
[1:15:16] year ago in january we thought we're
[1:15:18] going to move to arizona
[1:15:19] we were praying and we just had certain
[1:15:21] things that needed
[1:15:23] to be met obviously and um
[1:15:25] so last january i believe it was
[1:15:28] we're like we're going to move we're
[1:15:29] going to move and then we're like we
[1:15:30] don't have any money how are we going to
[1:15:31] move
[1:15:32] and i remember calling my mom and saying
[1:15:35] and i
[1:15:36] the lord is helping me a lot but i
[1:15:38] tend to worry and you know just forget
[1:15:41] what i'm gonna do and i called mom
[1:15:42] and i remember her telling me
[1:15:44] why don't you just
[1:15:45] take five dollars
[1:15:47] put it in savings or put it somewhere in
[1:15:49] the name of the lord
[1:15:51] so
[1:15:52] i did that and i said well okay five
[1:15:54] dollars i mean what's that gonna do but
[1:15:55] i did it
[1:15:56] and
[1:15:58] within three months that had
[1:16:01] gone up to
[1:16:02] i believe almost five thousand dollars
[1:16:04] just through
[1:16:06] some things that worked out and
[1:16:08] covid was a blessing in financial ways
[1:16:11] just different things that but there was
[1:16:13] different things that uh happened
[1:16:16] while we were still searching for the
[1:16:17] lord's will and one of them i wanted
[1:16:19] stephen it to be
[1:16:20] you know coming from different churches
[1:16:22] coming from different backgrounds i
[1:16:23] wanted to be sure that he would be happy
[1:16:24] and i in my heart i prayed and said lord
[1:16:27] i know he's not going to come if he's
[1:16:29] not going to be truly happy and i don't
[1:16:31] want him to come if he's truly going to
[1:16:32] be happy if it's not your will so i
[1:16:35] prayed and i really had it on my heart
[1:16:38] and one day we were driving home from
[1:16:40] church
[1:16:42] and just quiet not saying anything and
[1:16:44] then he just was driving he's looking
[1:16:46] straight ahead and he says i'm ready
[1:16:48] when i go you're ready he's like i'm
[1:16:50] ready to move
[1:16:52] and i had just been praying that and i
[1:16:54] was of course so excited right now right
[1:16:56] now and he was like well no not right
[1:16:58] now and i ruined the moment but
[1:17:00] just things like that there's other
[1:17:01] things that are a little more personal
[1:17:02] where i would just go to the room shut
[1:17:05] the door and pray and say lord here's
[1:17:07] something else
[1:17:08] if we're supposed to move this has to be
[1:17:10] answered and every time it was met
[1:17:12] so he couldn't find a job couldn't find
[1:17:15] a job geek squad was where he was
[1:17:17] working nothing was open nothing's open
[1:17:19] so the year went by and i was like we're

[1:17:57] three weeks two and a half to three
[1:17:58] weeks to find a place to live and we've
[1:18:01] moved over there five years ago so we
[1:18:03] the economy was different everything was
[1:18:04] different we cannot find a place to live
[1:18:07] and we have a dog who is
[1:18:09] part pitbull and i didn't know arizona
[1:18:11] has a pit bull law
[1:18:13] couldn't find a place and we were
[1:18:14] getting
[1:18:15] really stressed because we loved that
[1:18:17] dog
[1:18:18] and we were like what are we gonna do
[1:18:19] what are we gonna do
[1:18:21] i called my dad and he kept telling me
[1:18:23] because i was like dad can we just live
[1:18:24] in the shed like i will live in the shed
[1:18:26] and he always the same answer the lord
[1:18:29] will provide weight on the lord so it
[1:18:31] was two and a half weeks so we needed to
[1:18:33] move
[1:18:34] and i
[1:18:36] had a lot of anxiety like a lot of
[1:18:38] anxiety and i was laying in bed one day
[1:18:39] after work
[1:18:40] and i was just talking to a friend and i
[1:18:42] was like hey i know you have a trip a
[1:18:45] tree house in your yard can we live in
[1:18:46] the tree house just joking because she's
[1:18:48] always had this dream
[1:18:50] and she
[1:18:51] texts me she's nina i'm trying to write
[1:18:53] my place out and i go what and she's
[1:18:54] like i'm moving and i need to rent my
[1:18:56] place out so i call her and like are you
[1:18:58] joking and she goes no
[1:19:00] this is the answer to prayer for me i
[1:19:02] don't know who to give it to i don't
[1:19:03] trust anybody she goes but i trust you
[1:19:06] we've worked together for years we were
[1:19:07] friends
[1:19:08] and we had a place she had everything
[1:19:11] moved out within two weeks we had a
[1:19:12] place to live no security deposit she
[1:19:14] didn't care about the dog because she
[1:19:15] had a pitbull
[1:19:17] and we had a place to live so we get
[1:19:19] here and
[1:19:21] he's well i had
[1:19:23] extreme anxiety like to the point where
[1:19:25] i i couldn't do anything i couldn't work
[1:19:26] i couldn't
[1:19:28] just couldn't do anything and he was
[1:19:29] working but he was only getting about 30
[1:19:31] hours a week it was hard
[1:19:33] and um
[1:19:35] then the anxiety became so strong that
[1:19:37] um
[1:19:39] i just
[1:19:41] couldn't handle it i couldn't handle it
[1:19:42] and my sister one of my sisters told me
[1:19:44] she said you know i think the devil's
[1:19:45] trying to steal your joy
[1:19:47] this has been something you've been
[1:19:48] wanting you've both been wanting and now
[1:19:50] the devil's trying to steal it away from
[1:19:51] you
[1:19:52] so we just kept praying holding on and
[1:19:54] holding on to where we living in
[1:19:55] catalina it's really beautiful and at
[1:19:57] first i was like oh my gosh i don't want
[1:19:58] to live all the way over there and it's
[1:20:00] so much dirt and just like i don't want
[1:20:02] to be there
[1:20:03] but behind where we live is the most
[1:20:05] beautiful place and there's trails and
[1:20:07] the mountains are right there and the
[1:20:08] sunshine sunrise it's just beautiful and
[1:20:10] i had so much anxiety and i would just
[1:20:12] go out and walk and pray and walk and
[1:20:13] pray and walk and pray
[1:20:16] and cry to the lord and i walked miles
[1:20:18] and miles and
[1:20:19] then it hit me one day the lord gave
[1:20:21] this to you he knew that you were going
[1:20:23] to go through this he knew
[1:20:25] you know you you pray for this blessing
[1:20:27] and then all sudden it comes and this
[1:20:28] trial comes with it and you're like well
[1:20:30] i don't want that i just want the
[1:20:32] blessing but the lord has used this move
[1:20:35] to work something in my life that i've
[1:20:37] been trying to conquer since i was a
[1:20:38] child
[1:20:40] and the anxiety came so strong and i'm
[1:20:42] almost done but
[1:20:43] one night it was so strong and i don't
[1:20:45] know i always want to share testimony
[1:20:47] about anxiety just because i know that
[1:20:49] sometimes it can still be a taboo thing
[1:20:51] and sometimes people don't quite
[1:20:52] understand it but
[1:20:54] sometimes it just comes so strong you
[1:20:56] don't know what to do and i had it to
[1:20:58] the point where my body was convulsing
[1:21:01] and it was like it was trying to come
[1:21:02] out of me
[1:21:04] and i
[1:21:05] was walking with my dog one day
[1:21:07] and uh i noticed my chest started
[1:21:09] itching and it was red and my aunt had
[1:21:11] just had shingles too
[1:21:13] and i got back to the house and i told
[1:21:14] my my husband and my mother-in-law and
[1:21:16] my father-in-law is like
[1:21:17] she's like you have she i bet you you
[1:21:19] have shingles just from this dress
[1:21:21] and i said no no i'm not i'm not gonna
[1:21:23] take that so i went to the room and i
[1:21:25] laid on the bed
[1:21:27] and this for me was a huge
[1:21:29] i guess step in my spiritual journey
[1:21:31] because i've never been to a place where
[1:21:32] i said like brother green used to say
[1:21:34] though god slay me yet i'll trust him i
[1:21:36] remember him crying one day up here
[1:21:38] because he had lost his voice
[1:21:41] and he was saying though god slayed me
[1:21:42] yet i'll trust him so i had i was
[1:21:45] breaking out
[1:21:46] and i had so much anxiety like i said my
[1:21:47] body was just convulsing and i lay on
[1:21:49] the bed
[1:21:50] and i said lord
[1:21:53] i can't handle it i can't but if you
[1:21:56] see fit for me to go through this
[1:21:58] then i'll take it
[1:22:00] and i laid on the bed i turned on a
[1:22:01] sermon and right then brother branham
[1:22:02] was saying
[1:22:04] something along i don't remember exactly
[1:22:05] but it was along that line so i turned
[1:22:08] off the
[1:22:08] what i was listening to and i raised my
[1:22:10] hand and i started singing though god
[1:22:11] slayed me and i'll trust him and i found
[1:22:14] into the most beautiful sleep i just
[1:22:15] slept so calmly and the whole time
[1:22:18] stephen was like i don't know why you
[1:22:19] worry you don't have shingles you know
[1:22:20] option goes way bird
[1:22:22] and the next morning i woke up and i go
[1:22:25] it's gone it's gone and i had texted my
[1:22:27] friend too and she's like you have
[1:22:28] jingles because i had jingles you have
[1:22:30] shingles so i texted i just told that
[1:22:32] stephen it's gone it's gone
[1:22:34] the redness was gone
[1:22:36] and the day after that the burning was
[1:22:38] gone and it was gone completely so
[1:22:41] anyway so through all that then stephen
[1:22:43] was able to get
[1:22:45] the gig squad job just kept going lower
[1:22:47] and lower with hours messing up
[1:22:49] everything
[1:22:50] and then he got the job with my dad and
[1:22:51] now he's like overflowing with work
[1:22:53] and then the last thing um was i had so
[1:22:56] much anxiety i couldn't work and then i
[1:22:58] got went and applied at a place and i
[1:23:00] was like lord how am i gonna work how am
[1:23:02] i gonna work
[1:23:03] my very first day of work i drove up to
[1:23:06] work and i had no anxiety i was able to
[1:23:09] work through the day and had a wonderful
[1:23:10] day and i'm still there
[1:23:12] and the lord has just been
[1:23:15] helping me overcome and overcome to a
[1:23:16] place where i believe believing for my
[1:23:18] complete healing but the one thing that
[1:23:21] i was going to share real quick in
[1:23:22] catalina when i was walking around
[1:23:24] walking around
[1:23:26] just crying out to the lord
[1:23:27] i just looked up in the mountains and
[1:23:29] the sunrise and it was like the lord
[1:23:31] gave this to you i don't know if i said
[1:23:32] sorry the lord gave this to you he knew
[1:23:35] you were going to go through this he
[1:23:36] knew you needed a way of escape and he
[1:23:38] knows you love nature
[1:23:40] this is just for you so if you live in
[1:23:42] catalina it's not for you it's just for
[1:23:44] me all of that is just for me
[1:23:46] because the lord gave it to me
[1:23:52] [Applause]
[1:23:55] amen amen
[1:23:57] someone else have one sister sarah you
[1:23:59] want to come and prepare to sing who
[1:24:01] else has a testimony
[1:24:04] sister elizabeth sister beth
[1:24:06] sister naomi too
[1:24:24] sometimes we just think well it's just a
[1:24:26] little thing the lord has done for me
[1:24:27] but what brother john said you know even
[1:24:29] if it's little just if it can encourage
[1:24:31] somebody
[1:24:33] and
[1:24:34] i just wanted to share
[1:24:36] what
[1:24:38] i was going to ask that we sing a song
[1:24:40] because the other night i was
[1:24:42] the lord has
[1:24:43] helped me so much with anxiety
[1:24:45] depression
[1:24:46] i really know that he has touched me i
[1:24:48] gave a testimony what happened to me in
[1:24:50] february when brother joe adams was here
[1:24:53] and just the difference it's been
[1:24:55] but sometimes i just get in my own head
[1:24:57] too much
[1:24:58] and i just got discouraged the other
[1:25:00] night like last week and i was just like
[1:25:03] i'm done i give up
[1:25:05] and immediately and i know it wasn't me
[1:25:08] immediately the lord's
[1:25:10] the lord has been so good to me
[1:25:13] i feel like traveling on
[1:25:16] and i was like i can't complain he's
[1:25:18] been so good to me
[1:25:20] and so i just started singing that and
[1:25:22] just thanking him and pretty soon i
[1:25:24] wasn't thinking about all the things
[1:25:26] that were discouraging or upsetting
[1:25:30] he's been so good to me
[1:25:33] and
[1:25:34] just another quick little
[1:25:36] thing i wanted to share just what
[1:25:38] brother peter was saying i was like i
[1:25:39] don't know if i should share this
[1:25:40] because it feels like i don't want to
[1:25:42] glory in myself it's nothing to do with
[1:25:44] me but what he's saying is sometimes we
[1:25:46] don't know what is happening
[1:25:48] in my little sunday school room my
[1:25:50] sunday school class
[1:25:52] we've been reading the book of acts
[1:25:53] we've been going through the book of
[1:25:54] acts for
[1:25:56] almost a year and it has been so good
[1:25:59] and so the other day we did a lesson on
[1:26:02] um
[1:26:03] them taking the cloth
[1:26:05] from
[1:26:07] and and using it as prayer cloths
[1:26:10] um you know the power of god with was
[1:26:13] with paul so mightily and so i just felt
[1:26:16] to make the kids little prayer cloths
[1:26:19] and i'm a terrible sower i'm not good at
[1:26:21] it
[1:26:22] so i was trying and i was like i give up
[1:26:24] i this must not be of god because i
[1:26:26] can't even sew these little things
[1:26:28] so i put it aside well that evening it
[1:26:31] just came back so strong to make these
[1:26:33] little prayer cloths and i was like okay
[1:26:35] i'm going to do it i'm just going to
[1:26:37] figure it out and
[1:26:38] kids aren't going to care that they're
[1:26:40] sloppy i'm going to do my best
[1:26:43] so i made these little prayer cloths and
[1:26:46] we had our lesson and then i had my
[1:26:48] lesson that night with chloe and asher
[1:26:52] and
[1:26:53] chloe and ash when i gave them to them
[1:26:55] chloe has
[1:26:57] a little bit of anxiety at times of
[1:26:59] or bad dreams and she got it and she
[1:27:02] said as soon as i gave it to her she
[1:27:04] said this is going to help me so much
[1:27:08] help me with my thoughts and my dreams
[1:27:10] and asher got his and he said god is
[1:27:13] never going to leave me
[1:27:17] and i was just so overjoyed i mean it
[1:27:19] was just
[1:27:21] that's what i wanted them to see
[1:27:24] that's what i want them to experience
[1:27:28] and so
[1:27:30] i had given them to my nieces
[1:27:33] my other nieces and
[1:27:35] so the kids had a sleepover and my
[1:27:37] sister sent me a picture and she said
[1:27:39] all the kids have their prayer cloth to
[1:27:41] sleep with tonight they had taken him to
[1:27:43] the sleepover
[1:27:45] i went to my niece's house and i looked
[1:27:46] under her pillow and there was her
[1:27:48] little prayer cloth tucked
[1:27:50] and she asked me for another one she
[1:27:52] wanted to put it in her dad's traveling
[1:27:54] bag because we're believing he's going
[1:27:55] to come in
[1:27:56] and he travels a lot and she wanted to
[1:27:58] put one in his back for wherever he goes
[1:28:02] and i just think sometimes we just think
[1:28:04] we're doing a little thing we're just
[1:28:06] doing our little part
[1:28:08] but god can take it
[1:28:10] and use it
[1:28:11] and i just i'm so thankful what he's
[1:28:13] doing in their little lives
[1:28:21] go ahead sister sarah sing a song for us
[1:28:24] yeah
[1:28:25] then we'll have sister naomi give her
[1:28:26] testimony sister hope do you have a song
[1:28:28] for us tonight okay
[1:28:43] god bless you um i just wanted to say
[1:28:46] a quick testimony for something kind of
[1:28:48] along the lines of what peter was
[1:28:50] talking about the godhead and also what
[1:28:51] brother matthew said about the lord just
[1:28:53] speaking to him in his own life and
[1:28:55] quiet time and
[1:28:56] i was home the other day there's a
[1:28:58] little while ago and i was on youtube
[1:29:01] watching different videos and sometimes
[1:29:03] i'll look up
[1:29:04] kind of some apologetic things about
[1:29:07] defending christian faith in our
[1:29:08] doctrine and we already know of course
[1:29:10] that godhead is one of the big divisions
[1:29:14] and what separates us very clearly from
[1:29:16] a lot of other christian
[1:29:18] beliefs and i came across this video
[1:29:21] thing was like two hours long i did not
[1:29:22] even get halfway through this and i was
[1:29:24] just wanting to see what people say
[1:29:26] what they believe about the godhead and
[1:29:29] it was the most convoluted
[1:29:31] conflicting confusing thing i think i've
[1:29:34] ever heard on it and i've heard a lot
[1:29:36] so i was i got off of that i just got
[1:29:38] discouraged to turn it off and i said
[1:29:39] lord i want the truth
[1:29:42] i want to be able to share the truth
[1:29:44] what's the truth about the godhead
[1:29:46] you know and as i was sitting there i
[1:29:48] hadn't thought of this song
[1:29:50] for years we used to sing it way back
[1:29:53] when with brother nail i remember
[1:29:55] and
[1:29:56] the words just immediately started to
[1:29:58] play in my mind just so softly so gently
[1:30:02] the lord just answered me right in that
[1:30:04] moment and it was oh who do you say that
[1:30:06] i am and whence do you say i came do you
[1:30:08] know the father and can you tell his
[1:30:10] name and jesus dwells the fullness of
[1:30:12] the godhead don't you see jesus is the
[1:30:14] great i am and the great i am is he
[1:30:17] and i say thank you lord that's all it's
[1:30:21] that simple
[1:30:22] and of course we know that's a
[1:30:23] revelation i just thank the lord in that
[1:30:26] moment he answered me right then and
[1:30:27] there
[1:30:28] and just the quietness of even in my own
[1:30:30] heart and mind i need to send that song
[1:30:32] right to my mind so i just want to give
[1:30:34] him praise that he he answers those
[1:30:37] questions that you have in your heart
[1:30:39] and i'm grateful for that
[1:30:41] i'm actually going to sing this a
[1:30:42] cappella so
[1:30:45] it's just called children of the living

[1:33:49] sweetheart did you have a song tonight
[1:33:51] did you prepare
[1:33:55] okay
[1:33:56] anyone else have a testimony this
[1:33:57] evening
[1:34:00] all righty brother
[1:34:01] go ahead sister hammy
[1:34:05] mine's another testimony of the little
[1:34:07] things but more in the natural and the
[1:34:09] spiritual
[1:34:10] my dad talked about this morning
[1:34:11] sometimes to go back to your childhood
[1:34:14] just remind yourself of things
[1:34:18] um this story goes back about 15 years
[1:34:20] maybe um
[1:34:22] i drink pepsi i love pepsi
[1:34:25] after covid i can't drink it because it
[1:34:26] tastes like chemicals which is probably
[1:34:28] healthier for me but
[1:34:31] i used to get it from circle k
[1:34:33] and um where i worked there was two
[1:34:34] circle k's and close to cincinnali went
[1:34:37] to one of them because of how easy it
[1:34:39] was to get in and out of
[1:34:40] so i was going to go at lunch time and
[1:34:43] for some reason
[1:34:45] the thought came to me i should go to
[1:34:46] the other one and i'm like why would i
[1:34:47] go to the other one it's very hard i
[1:34:49] have to make a u-turn just not the flow
[1:34:51] of traffic like
[1:34:53] why
[1:34:54] so i went to the one i normally would
[1:34:56] and i walk in and the pepsi machine is
[1:34:58] out of order and i'm so upset
[1:35:02] so i'm like well i guess i'm going to
[1:35:03] the other one
[1:35:04] well
[1:35:06] back then
[1:35:07] pepsi circle k started redoing their
[1:35:09] fountain machines
[1:35:11] and not only do they have cubed ice but
[1:35:13] they added crushed ice which to me makes
[1:35:15] the soda taste that much better so i
[1:35:18] walk in and i had just installed this
[1:35:20] brand new machine double-sided cubed and
[1:35:22] crushed ice and i was like lord
[1:35:25] it truly is the little thing sometimes
[1:35:27] and i think of this story often as silly
[1:35:30] as it sounds but it means a great deal
[1:35:34] to me
[1:35:36] [Applause]
[1:35:41] sister hope we'll have her sing a song
[1:35:43] and then sister martha you can give your
[1:35:45] testimony
[1:35:49] [Music]
[1:35:54] there's a lie down
[1:35:56] on the hill
[1:36:00] that overlooks
[1:36:02] [Music]
[1:36:03] life safe
[1:36:07] and when
[1:36:08] i'm tossed it sins out a light that i
[1:36:16] might clearly see
[1:36:19] and
[1:36:20] the light
[1:36:22] that shines in darkness
[1:36:29] [Music]
[1:36:29] [Laughter]
[1:36:30] [Music]
[1:36:33] if it
[1:36:34] wasn't for
[1:36:38] [Music]
[1:36:45] and i thank god
[1:36:49] for
[1:36:50] the lighthouse
[1:36:57] [Music]
[1:37:01] jesus is
[1:37:03] the lighthouse
[1:37:09] i've seen
[1:37:11] he has shown
[1:37:14] his light around
[1:37:20] i
[1:37:21] might clearly
[1:37:23] see
[1:37:24] if it
[1:37:27] wasn't for
[1:37:29] the lighthouse
[1:37:31] tell me where
[1:37:39] [Music]
[1:37:42] everybody
[1:37:44] that was about us
[1:37:54] the big ships don't sell
[1:37:58] this way
[1:37:59] anymore
[1:38:00] there's
[1:38:03] [Music]
[1:38:10] [Music]
[1:38:13] when just
[1:38:15] [Music]
[1:38:26] that stands
[1:38:28] [Music]
[1:38:41] to him
[1:38:45] [Music]
[1:38:55] he
[1:38:56] has
[1:38:59] [Music]
[1:39:08] if it wasn't
[1:39:14] [Music]
[1:39:21] i think
[1:39:24] [Music]
[1:39:46] is
[1:39:48] [Music]
[1:39:54] might clearly see
[1:39:57] if it wasn't
[1:40:00] for
[1:40:02] the lighthouse
[1:40:03] [Music]
[1:40:18] sister martha
[1:40:27] um i thought i was just going to share
[1:40:29] the um i know that i'd put in a prayer
[1:40:31] request for my dad because
[1:40:34] he'd had the cancer this spot on his
[1:40:37] nose that originally the dermatologist
[1:40:39] was like
[1:40:41] you know looks fine it looks fine then
[1:40:43] it was it doesn't look fine
[1:40:45] um
[1:40:47] and uh
[1:40:49] he went and took a closer look at it and
[1:40:51] he says you're going to need some
[1:40:53] plastic surgery afterwards this is
[1:40:55] deeper than i thought
[1:40:57] um but it's you know it's it does not
[1:40:59] look like this is a the bad kind this
[1:41:02] looks like it's you know this is kind of
[1:41:04] normal you know it should be easy to get
[1:41:07] and i know that my dad was just
[1:41:09] he's like this just right after dealing
[1:41:11] with everything
[1:41:13] um and
[1:41:15] on monday he had the surgery
[1:41:18] they were able to get everything
[1:41:20] not a problem went straight into the
[1:41:22] plastic surgery and
[1:41:25] just everything is
[1:41:27] seems like it should be perfectly fine
[1:41:29] so i definitely appreciate the prayers i
[1:41:32] wasn't thinking about this at all but
[1:41:34] when she talked about
[1:41:35] the lord being mindful
[1:41:38] over something as small as soda
[1:41:44] on the night that my mom passed away
[1:41:47] i had spent
[1:41:50] the whole day there at the house
[1:41:53] and
[1:41:54] i didn't want to leave until she was
[1:41:56] gone
[1:41:57] and so
[1:41:59] after she was gone i told jordan i said
[1:42:01] i need some time to myself
[1:42:05] and i was doing okay
[1:42:07] and
[1:42:08] and i made the mistake of looking up
[1:42:10] some photos and some stuff and i ran
[1:42:12] across a project that i was supposed to
[1:42:14] get done for her that she'd asked me to
[1:42:16] do and i just
[1:42:20] just came from nowhere you know you just
[1:42:22] sit there and you're just
[1:42:24] agony
[1:42:26] and um after a little bit of time i just
[1:42:29] kind of
[1:42:30] was able to calm down
[1:42:33] and i was like
[1:42:34] that's kind of rough on the throat i
[1:42:36] need something cold to drink you know
[1:42:38] that would feel really good and
[1:42:40] i had seen a sonic so i went to the
[1:42:42] sonic and
[1:42:44] i sat there for probably 20 or 30
[1:42:46] minutes
[1:42:47] with the window down
[1:42:49] in december
[1:42:50] in flagstaff it actually felt really
[1:42:53] good
[1:42:55] but i never got to the point of being
[1:42:56] able to get in order because like they
[1:42:58] were closing down or whatever and i
[1:42:59] guess i'd come there after that point so
[1:43:01] i was like you know what there's a
[1:43:02] little gas station
[1:43:04] just at the bottom of the hill from
[1:43:06] where my parents are generally those i
[1:43:08] think my mom would go and get slushies
[1:43:09] there
[1:43:11] and i went there and i looked around
[1:43:14] and they had slushies and i just got a
[1:43:15] little slushy and i was looking should i
[1:43:17] get a little snack whatever now i just
[1:43:20] want the slushie
[1:43:21] and
[1:43:22] um
[1:43:24] took it up to the counter and the guy
[1:43:26] looks at me he goes is this all
[1:43:28] i said he goes
[1:43:30] you're all good merry christmas
[1:43:33] and that just
[1:43:35] just meant so much to me
[1:43:39] just that little gesture
[1:43:42] and
[1:43:45] i just drove around the neighborhood
[1:43:46] because i still wasn't ready to go back
[1:43:48] and
[1:43:49] i went to go up into the neighborhood
[1:43:51] where my parents had first moved when
[1:43:53] they came to flagstaff
[1:43:55] and as i drove up into the neighborhood
[1:43:57] about where they lived my mom would
[1:43:59] always tell us there's this herd of elk
[1:44:01] that would come through the neighborhood
[1:44:03] and they would call it the continental
[1:44:05] elk herd because
[1:44:07] they couldn't be touched
[1:44:09] and there in the middle of the road was
[1:44:10] the herd of elk
[1:44:12] just
[1:44:14] they owned the road and so i just sat
[1:44:16] there and i watched them a bit
[1:44:18] before i went back to the house and just
[1:44:20] you know
[1:44:21] i don't think i really slept that well
[1:44:23] but you know it was just that little bit
[1:44:25] and then
[1:44:26] after mom's memorial service
[1:44:28] i was like you know i would really love
[1:44:30] to be able to thank
[1:44:33] the clerk but that little gesture meant
[1:44:35] so much to me
[1:44:37] and i think we stopped there to get gas
[1:44:40] and
[1:44:41] i was like i'm just going to run in i'm
[1:44:43] just going to run in and i took i went
[1:44:45] to the clerk and i said
[1:44:47] i was here on christmas eve i don't know
[1:44:49] who was working the evening shift he
[1:44:51] goes that was me
[1:44:53] i said you have no idea that little
[1:44:55] gesture meant so much to me and i just
[1:44:58] told him i said that just my mom had
[1:45:00] passed away and that meant just the
[1:45:02] world to me and he
[1:45:04] he came around the counter and just gave
[1:45:06] me a hug and i just i don't know i i
[1:45:08] guess i think of those little things
[1:45:09] like those are
[1:45:11] maybe those little moments of that cold
[1:45:13] cup of water that
[1:45:15] the lord will reward him for later but
[1:45:16] that just
[1:45:18] when you told the soda story i'm like
[1:45:19] great i got my own and i'm not sure i
[1:45:21] want to share this
[1:45:23] but i'm just thankful that the lord was
[1:45:25] just so mindful of me of just that
[1:45:26] little bit in the moment where i just
[1:45:30] didn't know i needed it
[1:45:39] as brother peter said it's
[1:45:41] sometimes difficult to have services
[1:45:43] like this because there's so many
[1:45:45] testimonies you think of as people are
[1:45:47] talking and
[1:45:48] i mean just as she was sharing in others
[1:45:50] i've thought of three or four
[1:45:53] you know and
[1:45:54] we're up here all the time as brothers
[1:45:56] and so sometimes i feel like what the
[1:45:58] congregation is share but brother ed
[1:45:59] would you take it to the brother there
[1:46:00] in the back brother i'm sorry you we met
[1:46:03] a few weeks ago and i forgot your name
[1:46:05] but you just feel free to introduce
[1:46:07] yourself again to the whole congregation
[1:46:08] it's really great to have you
[1:46:10] be attending with us and
[1:46:12] it's good to have you brother
[1:46:17] thank you my name is dominique baker and
[1:46:20] i give honor to god
[1:46:22] and for all you his saints and i'd try
[1:46:26] to keep it the short version
[1:46:28] your witness is very effective
[1:46:32] i thought i thought i was found but like
[1:46:34] nina said about her husband you know
[1:46:36] getting so religiously confused and
[1:46:38] everything i was very lost for about 30
[1:46:41] years and
[1:46:43] a message believer
[1:46:45] decided to share this message with me at
[1:46:47] a public library here in tucson and
[1:46:51] so
[1:46:52] i didn't know i was so lost and i had so
[1:46:56] many things to repent of and i've seen
[1:46:58] the lord changing a lot of things around
[1:47:00] in my life
[1:47:01] and um so keep keep this witness
[1:47:04] because uh i wanted to say also brother
[1:47:07] one of your brother chico's relatives
[1:47:10] tried to share it with me
[1:47:11] after high school uh
[1:47:13] long story short one of our parents
[1:47:16] brought us to this church when we were
[1:47:17] teenagers and but we didn't know the
[1:47:19] message
[1:47:20] um
[1:47:22] i'm not trying to be funny we thought it
[1:47:24] was the foot wash church because every
[1:47:26] time they brought us
[1:47:28] my parent brought us it was put wash
[1:47:30] time and everything so
[1:47:33] that was when i was a teenager but then
[1:47:35] um
[1:47:36] i don't know if you all remember brother
[1:47:38] uh brother dennis uh
[1:47:41] ballard you if you guys remember brother
[1:47:43] dennis ballard he used to drive uh
[1:47:46] brother branham's books to my house and
[1:47:50] and i never did get to read all of them
[1:47:52] i couldn't understand it that good but
[1:47:55] this message believer made it pretty
[1:47:57] easy for me and they
[1:47:59] provided some tapes or something to
[1:48:00] listen to
[1:48:02] and i had no idea i was that lost and i
[1:48:06] got found in those tapes about two years
[1:48:08] ago back in april
[1:48:10] and uh then i just uh i decided to make
[1:48:13] lots of changes and i'm really trying to
[1:48:16] bring my family into this message
[1:48:18] and so don't stop your witness every
[1:48:21] time i see a message believer i can spot
[1:48:23] him out like pepper and salt
[1:48:25] and i'm like i know you and i'm trying
[1:48:27] to be down with you okay so thank you
[1:48:30] god bless you amen
[1:48:32] [Applause]
[1:48:36] amen amen let's just stand we'll turn
[1:48:38] the surface over to brother aaron and

[1:49:52] that's the greatest testimony of yours
[1:49:55] because the lord has been good to me
[1:49:57] amen
[1:50:00] brother john yeah
[1:50:07] so i've wanted to say this for a long
[1:50:08] time and here i am
[1:50:11] you know with this project
[1:50:14] and if each of you
[1:50:16] who gave a testimony tonight
[1:50:18] would write it down
[1:50:20] because it's easier for you to write it
[1:50:22] down and i can translate it
[1:50:24] easier
[1:50:27] okay just
[1:50:28] just write it down it doesn't
[1:50:30] because i got what they call natural
[1:50:32] dragon and i can i can read what you
[1:50:34] have have written and it makes a lot
[1:50:36] easier than
[1:50:37] trying to hear it
[1:50:38] but i have a testimony about you know
[1:50:41] every once in a while
[1:50:43] and we haven't had one for a long time
[1:50:45] that we've had
[1:50:46] a
[1:50:47] prayer line
[1:50:50] okay
[1:50:52] and about three or four months ago i was
[1:50:57] a little hesitant
[1:50:59] to get one the prayer lines
[1:51:03] and i did
[1:51:05] and my condition was if if
[1:51:07] some of you might know some medical
[1:51:09] terms but it was hematuria
[1:51:11] and hematuria hema means blood tyrion
[1:51:15] means in the urine
[1:51:17] so i had blood in the urine and you can
[1:51:19] have two types you can have micro
[1:51:22] imagery which is
[1:51:24] you can't see they have these little
[1:51:26] dipsticks you put in and
[1:51:28] you know it shows that you have
[1:51:30] blood cells in your urine which is
[1:51:34] not normal
[1:51:36] and not good
[1:51:38] i had macro imagery it means
[1:51:42] i could see it
[1:51:44] and i had it for about a week
[1:51:48] know and i prayed about it
[1:51:50] and it got worse i mean it was to the
[1:51:52] point that i was almost about to go
[1:51:56] to
[1:51:57] the emergency room
[1:51:59] and there's all kinds of reasons why
[1:52:01] that happens
[1:52:05] and a majority of them were not good
[1:52:09] so i went through the prayer line
[1:52:14] next day still had hematuria
[1:52:17] it seemed like it was getting worse
[1:52:21] second date
[1:52:23] still had hematuria
[1:52:25] insane was saying you know
[1:52:28] nope
[1:52:29] you got to go to the emergency room well
[1:52:30] i
[1:52:32] was a little stubborn i said no by
[1:52:34] his stripes i'm healed
[1:52:37] and within three days after a week
[1:52:41] of hemi
[1:52:42] material
[1:52:45] going to the
[1:52:46] prayer line
[1:52:48] three days later
[1:52:50] i was cured amen
[1:52:53] this has been probably about
[1:52:56] i don't know four or five months now
[1:52:59] so
[1:53:00] yeah
[1:53:02] praise god i give you glory to god
[1:53:05] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:53:08] and forever he changes now
[1:53:10] as you listen to testimonies they bring
[1:53:13] memories and things of of what you've
[1:53:15] gone through what you've done but
[1:53:18] you never know what a simple
[1:53:20] gesture a simple uh acknowledgement will
[1:53:23] do for somebody that you carry
[1:53:26] you know and i always think of that
[1:53:28] scripture
[1:53:29] well you gave me a cold cup of water
[1:53:33] when i was in pr you know
[1:53:35] and they asked him when
[1:53:37] did we do this to you and he said when
[1:53:39] you did this to one of my little ones
[1:53:42] you were doing it to me so you're not
[1:53:44] doing it
[1:53:45] uh in the sense to bring honor and glory
[1:53:47] or to yourself or anything like that
[1:53:49] you're just doing what god has asked you
[1:53:51] to do and he gets the glory for it and
[1:53:54] someone reaps the benefits of it
[1:53:57] and that's us
[1:53:58] when you when you give god honor and
[1:54:00] glory and you praise him it pleases him
[1:54:03] and he draws an eye to you
[1:54:05] i think of that sister had he right
[1:54:08] when she told brother branham that is
[1:54:10] nothing but the truth
[1:54:12] it pleased god so much as someone took
[1:54:15] him at his word
[1:54:17] and he said give her whatever she wants
[1:54:21] he doesn't change he's never changed
[1:54:23] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:54:25] forever brother joel your boys are back
[1:54:27] there i don't know if you noticed that
[1:54:29] so it was good to see them come in today
[1:54:32] you love the lord jesus
[1:54:34] you love the lord jesus
[1:54:36] amen has he been good to you
[1:54:39] you know sometimes um
[1:54:42] the girls will tell me everybody's gonna
[1:54:44] think that brother aaron's daughters
[1:54:45] have all kinds of problems or something
[1:54:47] we're always given
[1:54:48] testimony i said well thank the lord
[1:54:52] you know and i appreciate that but
[1:54:54] it goes back to how we were raised
[1:54:58] my father my mother always shared with
[1:55:00] us the goodness of god
[1:55:03] the ability of god he's a healer he's a
[1:55:05] keeper you know
[1:55:07] and and some people say how do you know
[1:55:08] this because i've seen it it works
[1:55:11] and i can testify of it
[1:55:13] about where sister holius is standing
[1:55:16] right there
[1:55:17] brother bobby rourke was here one night
[1:55:20] and i had some real
[1:55:22] hard pain on my left foot it hurt to
[1:55:25] walk
[1:55:26] and the doctor said you got gout
[1:55:29] well i really didn't know what it was
[1:55:31] but i know it hurt
[1:55:34] and brother bobby was speaking brother
[1:55:35] bobby words and a rourke i'm sorry there
[1:55:38] and he said if you have something that
[1:55:40] hurts you stand up right now claim your
[1:55:43] healing and move that part that hurts
[1:55:47] i stood right about where she said i
[1:55:49] stuck my leg out and i started moving
[1:55:51] the ankle like this
[1:55:53] and it has never hurt again
[1:55:56] because god is able you take him at his
[1:55:58] word and those are the things that we
[1:56:01] share to one another those how we
[1:56:02] encourage one another he is more than
[1:56:05] able amen
[1:56:06] brother arne i had felt in my heart to
[1:56:09] call you up to close the service in
[1:56:11] prayer
[1:56:12] and i know that brother arnie's been
[1:56:14] dealing with with brother l peterson and
[1:56:19] if someone holds a special place in this
[1:56:21] church that's brother al peterson
[1:56:23] for the many years that he has served
[1:56:25] and done done what he did and
[1:56:27] and how he treats people and how he
[1:56:29] treated us
[1:56:31] in in even myself when i first came to
[1:56:34] the tabernacle
[1:56:37] we were just a young family coming i
[1:56:40] i think rachel had my youngest had just
[1:56:42] been born and
[1:56:44] and i was just remembering having a a
[1:56:47] warm
[1:56:48] uh a greeting from brother l peterson
[1:56:50] and them just making you feel right at
[1:56:52] home
[1:56:54] and i always thought i did nothing to
[1:56:56] deserve this to be you know
[1:56:59] but he treated me like
[1:57:01] i could almost say like a a nephew you
[1:57:04] know just somebody that
[1:57:06] and to sit under his his mentoring and
[1:57:09] all i think back about it god was good
[1:57:12] to us
[1:57:13] and allowed that to see him
[1:57:15] and i know that brother arne's been
[1:57:16] taking care of dad and sister rachel and
[1:57:19] the family and
[1:57:21] i've wondered what that's going to be
[1:57:23] the time if we're here long enough well
[1:57:25] i will be doing that same thing
[1:57:27] because if time goes on we'll all come
[1:57:30] to that place
[1:57:31] but to have a testimony like that
[1:57:35] that others speak well
[1:57:37] that others have received from it's been
[1:57:40] a blessing and i'll say this and i don't
[1:57:42] mean it to raise brother ornie or the
[1:57:45] peterson family up in a way but i thank
[1:57:47] god for the peterson family in this
[1:57:49] church
[1:57:54] they
[1:57:55] they have given of themselves over over
[1:57:58] and over
[1:58:00] and it's it's you get you get tired you
[1:58:02] get frustrated
[1:58:05] it all happens
[1:58:06] but i appreciate
[1:58:08] and it comes from brother arne
[1:58:10] and ancestor peterson from the brother l
[1:58:12] i'm sorry sister peter sister minnie who
[1:58:15] taught it to them and now and i do
[1:58:17] appreciate each one of them sister grace
[1:58:20] sister lily coming up and doing what
[1:58:22] they do
[1:58:23] brother jordan coming up and and working
[1:58:25] with the sound as much as he's done
[1:58:28] and um
[1:58:30] each one of them and i know sister
[1:58:31] rachel they do a lot of in the office
[1:58:33] and when we have a
[1:58:35] fellowship here they're very involved
[1:58:38] and it takes a lot of time
[1:58:40] and again i just want to say thank you
[1:58:42] to the peterson family god bless them
[1:58:53] thank you very much we have a wonderful
[1:58:55] heavenly father
[1:58:57] and he just doesn't fail like brother
[1:59:00] brown says he cannot fail so that's what
[1:59:02] i'm trying to do is i love brother
[1:59:04] dominique's testimony i remember brother
[1:59:06] dennis ballard getting after us up here
[1:59:09] does anybody remember that we're all
[1:59:11] probably different now i remember one
[1:59:12] time brother green says who's here from
[1:59:14] day one and sister green was the only
[1:59:16] one that raised her i know there were
[1:59:18] others but
[1:59:20] at that time and and he said what are
[1:59:21] you doing here
[1:59:23] so
[1:59:24] thank you for all being here and
[1:59:27] um
[1:59:29] you know it's something to be
[1:59:32] alive at this time
[1:59:35] and
[1:59:36] i enjoyed your sermon about the sand and
[1:59:38] the silica and the because my dream has
[1:59:41] been to build a
[1:59:43] mud house before i lived here in arizona
[1:59:46] they call this the old adobe you know
[1:59:48] dirt cheap
[1:59:50] so anybody could afford a house anybody
[1:59:53] could afford a wife

[1:59:57] their own garden
[1:59:58] but so far
[2:00:00] i am i say i am i've got a helper
[2:00:03] building but my first building and i've
[2:00:05] been wanting i've been dreaming about

[2:00:39] so mindful
[2:00:41] of every little thing that
[2:00:44] we think
[2:00:46] and we ought to look at some things you
[2:00:47] did i thought how did you do that

[2:00:52] could kind of carnal or
[2:00:55] the animal in us lord we just wanna
