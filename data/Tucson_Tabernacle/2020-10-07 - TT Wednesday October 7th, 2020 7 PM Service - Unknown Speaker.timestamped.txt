[24:32] [Music]
[24:58] so
[25:06] jesus greatest
[25:18] and i know not why god's
[25:22] wonders grace
[25:29] [Music]
[25:40] is
[25:42] [Music]
[25:53] he is able to
[25:57] keep that which i've committed
[26:02] unto him
[26:10] not how this saving
[26:14] faith to me
[26:20] [Music]
[26:22] did
[26:25] it is
[26:38] [Music]
[26:49] which i've committed
[26:52] [Music]
[27:03] brother branham says if you go to the
[27:04] doctor listen to what the doctor says
[27:07] you know and again when i go to the
[27:09] doctor i don't go with my confidence in
[27:11] the doctor
[27:13] i go with my confidence in god one of
[27:16] of brother branham's best friends was dr
[27:18] sam adair
[27:20] and he listened to the doctor quite
[27:21] often why
[27:24] because god uses people to help us out
[27:27] to do things you know and and so
[27:30] what why go to the doctor if you have no
[27:33] intention of doing it
[27:35] when you say you know lord you you've
[27:37] directed me you've led me you're
[27:39] going and and this is for my good
[27:43] now we have the doctor of doctors
[27:46] and one thing about this doctor he can
[27:47] go look right through you and say oh
[27:50] you're here for this and this not for
[27:53] what you told me you didn't you know
[27:56] sometimes we're just trying to cover it
[27:58] but god looks down you know they're
[28:01] coming through the line and
[28:02] and and the prophet would stand there
[28:04] and he says now you know who i'm waiting
[28:06] for you know what i'm waiting for i'm
[28:08] just
[28:08] talking then he would go he's here
[28:12] and at that point he knew the secrets of
[28:15] the heart would be unveiled
[28:17] the reasons why now you've come for this
[28:19] and this
[28:20] and oh and i see this and not just that
[28:24] but
[28:24] and he would begin to see not brother
[28:26] branham but that angel of the lord
[28:28] doing that and we come like that to
[28:30] church saying lord i've come
[28:31] these are my intentions this is my heart
[28:34] but you know what's best
[28:36] you've already purposed something and
[28:38] you've made preparation for it again
[28:41] and as i was looking at that you know we
[28:44] looking there with with brother
[28:45] tim emelon's daughter she's 21 years old
[28:48] and it just seemed like the other day
[28:49] she was just a little girl and
[28:51] here she's 21 and and planning to get
[28:53] married you know and
[28:55] i look back at now and we're going on 42
[28:57] years and it just seemed like it was the
[28:59] other day for us
[29:00] you know but time goes on but you know
[29:03] god had a reason
[29:05] and a place and and when i was thinking
[29:07] this and i
[29:08] brother jordan just walked out and god
[29:10] had a purpose and a place and
[29:12] and when i was thinking that i said
[29:15] there was a jordan for sister martha and
[29:17] there was a sister martha for brother
[29:18] jordan
[29:20] now before they met each other they
[29:23] didn't know that
[29:25] and i don't know why god just gave me
[29:27] that name
[29:29] but that's what he did you know and and
[29:31] he there was
[29:32] that and and then they come to a time in
[29:35] life where they get to meet each other
[29:37] and something begins to to happen you
[29:40] know you
[29:41] you you could say a reaction or this and
[29:42] that the doctor tried
[29:44] but god had already ordained that so
[29:47] that time came and that's that's for
[29:48] each one of us you know
[29:50] and um we realize god has a purpose
[29:55] for your life and my life romans 8 28
[29:58] all things are for our good
[30:02] all things he said even though some of
[30:04] the things don't look like
[30:06] they're very good it's not the way we we
[30:08] would plant them so
[30:10] just looking at that today god has a
[30:12] purpose
[30:14] and he made a preparation so when we go
[30:16] back to genesis
[30:18] and and we read that um first verse you
[30:22] know
[30:23] that we had here let's put that verse
[30:27] back up there brother jordan
[30:32] in the very first verse
[30:35] and the lord god took the man and put
[30:38] him in the garden of eden to dress it
[30:40] and to keep it and the lord god
[30:43] commanded the man saying of every tree
[30:46] of the garden thou mayest deep freely
[30:49] there's pretty simple directions right
[30:51] there it's not very complicated
[30:53] you know but of the tree of the
[30:56] knowledge of good and evil thou shall
[30:57] not eat of it
[30:59] for in the day that thou eat is thereof
[31:01] thou
[31:02] shalt surely die and the lord god said
[31:06] it is not good
[31:08] that the man should be alone i will make
[31:10] and help meet for him.
[31:13] and now he tells them it's yours the
[31:16] garden is here
[31:17] take care of it you'll do this you know
[31:19] and it wasn't going to be
[31:20] hard labor for for
[31:24] adam that was to come later after the
[31:26] fall
[31:28] but here was he says but there's just
[31:31] one thing
[31:33] of the two trees you are not to partake
[31:35] of this one
[31:37] but of this one you may feast you may
[31:39] eat of all the time
[31:42] you know god had a reason and a purpose
[31:45] why
[31:46] because you know brother branham talks
[31:49] about he gets into it because in him
[31:51] was all these attributes was
[31:54] in him was a savior and him was a
[31:57] redeemer and him was a comforter and him
[32:00] was a healer every part of this
[32:02] was in him already it was part of his
[32:04] nature
[32:05] now in us in each human there's a lot of
[32:09] things that are already in there
[32:11] but it's not until you begin to grow and
[32:13] your life because you began to express
[32:15] some of it
[32:16] so god puts that tree in there for a
[32:18] reason and for a purpose
[32:21] knowing that man would partake of that
[32:24] tree
[32:25] even though he was told not to do it god
[32:28] allowed it to be
[32:30] because god wanted to express
[32:33] himself in healing in redemption
[32:37] in salvation now you and i would have
[32:39] probably never done it that way we would
[32:41] have said let's skip all of that
[32:42] let's just have adam and eve in the
[32:45] garden and never have an issue again
[32:47] but there would always be something
[32:50] missing
[32:52] something pulling something drawing so
[32:54] we know this and
[32:55] we know all the stories so i'm just
[32:57] going to skip some of the scriptures and
[32:58] not be too long here
[33:01] he says and then we go to
[33:05] the next the next scriptures here
[33:11] and out of the ground of the lord god
[33:14] formed every beast of the field in every
[33:15] file of the air and brought them unto
[33:17] adam
[33:18] to see what he would call them and
[33:20] whatsoever adam
[33:22] called every living creature that was
[33:24] the name thereof
[33:26] and adam gave names to all the cattle
[33:28] and to the fowl of the air
[33:30] and to every beast of the field but for
[33:32] adam there was
[33:34] was not found and helped me for him i
[33:37] i don't know i would just kind of look
[33:39] at that scripture and say
[33:40] adam kind of got close to the horse
[33:44] and said man this is a nice horse but no
[33:50] um there was something in adam
[33:53] calling out for that other part there
[33:55] was something in adam
[33:57] that said you know as he's going through
[34:00] and he's naming them
[34:01] but the scripture tells him sal says
[34:03] adam did not find that
[34:06] other portion that part yet he's naming
[34:08] all the animals and
[34:09] and i don't know why he named him what
[34:12] they named him but
[34:13] it worked fine didn't it yeah an
[34:16] elephant's an elephant
[34:18] why he named it i don't know but he says
[34:22] and the lord caused a deep sleep to fall
[34:25] upon adam and he slept
[34:27] and he took one of his ribs and closed
[34:29] up the flesh instead thereof
[34:31] and the rib which the lord god had taken
[34:34] from man
[34:35] made he a woman and brought her unto the
[34:38] man
[34:39] now brother tim on on wednesday on
[34:41] sunday
[34:42] he got into some of this also and i
[34:45] already knew what was in my notes
[34:46] as he's preaching this and i'm like wow
[34:49] you know
[34:50] just it goes right in there but to to
[34:52] think you know here
[34:53] adam has looked at all these animals the
[34:55] birds
[34:56] and all of this but there's something
[34:58] that still says no
[34:59] no that's not that that's not the one
[35:01] that's not that satisfying portion
[35:04] so god takes that portion out of adam
[35:07] that was eve
[35:09] and he and he and he forms her
[35:12] separately away from adam
[35:13] because as any and he brought her unto
[35:16] him
[35:17] so in my mind i could see the lord
[35:19] taking eve
[35:20] through the garden and she's looking at
[35:23] the same animals
[35:25] that adam named she sees the elephants
[35:29] she sees the birds she sees the lions
[35:32] and and she had to have the same
[35:34] reaction that is neat that is beautiful
[35:36] that's
[35:37] but that's not the one there's there's
[35:40] it's on both sides you understand what
[35:42] i'm saying god saw
[35:44] you but there was something in you to
[35:46] respond back
[35:48] and to respond back to him not just
[35:50] anything we try to respond to other ways
[35:53] we try to respond to
[35:54] at this church or this belief or
[35:57] whatever it was in your life
[35:59] but it wasn't satisfying
[36:02] but she sees adam and something says
[36:06] that's the one there's the one
[36:09] now it was it was a fairytale wedding
[36:12] and they lived happily ever after
[36:16] and that was the last of the bible right
[36:19] no
[36:21] the tree of knowledge
[36:24] of good and knowledge was there
[36:28] and god knew they would partake of it
[36:32] so he had a purpose and that purpose was
[36:35] to
[36:35] show himself as a redeemer a healer
[36:38] a keeper a savior
[36:42] he had to prepare something for it so
[36:45] amongst
[36:46] the animals that adam named and eve saw
[36:50] there was a lamb that god put in the
[36:53] garden also
[36:56] now the lamb didn't know why it was in
[36:58] the garden
[37:00] but god knew why the lamb was placed in
[37:02] the garden
[37:04] and there came a day when adam and eve
[37:06] fell
[37:08] that the lamb had to be slain to clothe
[37:11] them
[37:12] and cover them with the blood
[37:15] god prepared something
[37:18] to meet that action
[37:21] already because the scripture tells us
[37:24] that he was slain
[37:26] from before the foundation of the world
[37:29] he had already planned this had already
[37:32] seen it
[37:33] now he's bringing it to pass
[37:36] now you know jesus had a choice when he
[37:39] gets to
[37:40] gethsemane and he's up there and he's
[37:42] asked his disciples
[37:44] to pray with him to spend some time
[37:46] there with him
[37:47] because he's coming to that decision in
[37:49] his life
[37:51] and he says father he says
[37:55] that this cup would pass from me that
[37:56] this way that has been planned and
[37:58] prepared in all
[37:59] is there a way we can do this
[38:01] differently
[38:03] is there a way without the shedding of
[38:05] blood
[38:07] but he had already known that the lamb
[38:09] had lost its life and he was the perfect
[38:11] lamb of god
[38:12] so he humbled himself and said not my
[38:15] will be done
[38:17] but your will be done because he had a
[38:20] plan
[38:21] and he had a purpose and he was going to
[38:23] do that so so we know that
[38:26] here now we go to genesis 3.
[38:33] chapter 3 god also put a serpent
[38:36] in there in the garden
[38:39] because there had to come away for a
[38:41] fall
[38:43] there had to come away for this plan to
[38:45] continue on
[38:47] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[38:49] beast of the field
[38:50] which the lord god had made and he said
[38:53] unto the woman
[38:54] yea hath god said you shall not eat of
[38:56] every tree of the garden and i just
[38:58] chose that that scripture just to start
[39:00] this portion
[39:01] i don't want to spend the whole time
[39:03] reading through the first two or three
[39:04] chapters of
[39:05] genesis and and we know
[39:08] they began to converse they began to
[39:10] talk and again
[39:12] god wasn't surprised by that god wasn't
[39:15] like oh no
[39:16] adam what are you doing come on go you
[39:18] know there was
[39:19] a plan there had to be a fall in order
[39:22] for god to continue the plan and the
[39:25] purpose of his life
[39:27] what he's doing so we know that she
[39:29] partakes of that tree
[39:31] and we know the fall so now we go to
[39:35] verse 21 of chapter three
[39:39] and unto adam also to his wife did the
[39:42] lord god make coats of skins
[39:45] and clothe them the first death
[39:48] the first sacrifice that was made right
[39:51] here in the very beginning
[39:53] god took and shed the life or the blood
[39:56] of an innocent animal for his children
[40:01] to meet god's purpose and his plan so i
[40:04] just wanted to lay that out
[40:06] god from the beginning had a plan
[40:11] and he purposed these situations these
[40:14] things happen
[40:15] so he could bring it to pass so let's
[40:17] look at some of the things that
[40:20] that god did and some in the old
[40:22] testament and some in the new testament
[40:24] let's go to first kings 17
[40:28] and we'll read verses 8-15
[40:31] there are so many things as i was
[40:33] thinking into the names when you look at
[40:35] noah and you look at
[40:36] moses and you look at the different ones
[40:39] and see
[40:40] and we have the the ability to read in
[40:43] the scriptures how it took place
[40:45] but they were actually living it they
[40:47] were going through it
[40:49] and they probably questioned why why did
[40:52] this go this way
[40:53] why is this but god had a reason and the
[40:57] word of the lord came unto him
[40:58] saying arise get thee to zeropath
[41:02] which belongs to zidane and dwell there
[41:04] behold i have commanded a widow woman
[41:07] there to sustain thee the story of
[41:09] elijah going down
[41:11] now the wooden widow woman did not know
[41:15] that's what she was there for
[41:19] she was as you'll see as we read on a
[41:21] little bit what she was saying but god
[41:22] said go down there
[41:24] i've commanded a widow woman to sustain
[41:27] thee
[41:29] and so he arose and went to zero path
[41:31] you know
[41:32] when god says go get up and go
[41:35] that's the best way get up and go
[41:38] and when he came to the gate of the city
[41:40] behold the widowman widow woman was
[41:42] there
[41:43] gathering of sticks and he called to her
[41:45] and said
[41:46] fetch me i pray thee a little water in a
[41:49] vessel that i may drink now
[41:50] he knows what's going to happen but she
[41:53] doesn't
[41:55] he knows what's going to happen and
[41:57] sometimes we don't
[42:00] but we trust in him he's proven himself
[42:02] over and over
[42:04] and she said and she and as she was
[42:06] going to fetch it
[42:09] he called her and said bring me i pray
[42:11] thee
[42:12] a morsel of bread in thine hand.
[42:16] and she said as the lord thy god liveth
[42:18] i have not a cake
[42:19] but a handful of meal in a barrel and a
[42:22] little oil and a cruce
[42:23] and behold i am gathering two sticks
[42:26] that i may go in and dress it for me and
[42:28] my son
[42:29] that we may eat it and die so we know
[42:32] she had no idea
[42:34] what was coming going to take place she
[42:36] was making preparations for what she
[42:38] thought was going to take place
[42:40] i'm down to my last meal with my son
[42:42] we're going to eat
[42:44] and then we're going to prepare to die
[42:46] and watch what elijah says and elijah
[42:48] said unto her fear not
[42:51] god says the same thing fear not
[42:54] through this time that we're going
[42:55] through right and everything that's
[42:56] happening fear not
[42:59] god has got a purpose and he has us
[43:01] under control
[43:02] go and do as that then i get to eat it
[43:06] too
[43:06] she said this is her thoughts
[43:10] you know but let me just say this elijah
[43:12] knew what was going to take place
[43:14] god had told him already and i want to
[43:16] say to you you already know what god
[43:18] has purposed and promised god has
[43:21] already said
[43:22] i will deliver i will return and and
[43:25] take her up to me
[43:26] there'll be a heaven there'll be a place
[43:28] god has already said that
[43:31] so we have to have that same trust that
[43:33] same confidence
[43:34] for thus saith the lord god of israel
[43:37] the barrel of mill shall not waste
[43:39] neither shall
[43:40] the cruce of oil fall until the day that
[43:43] the lord sinneth reign upon the earth
[43:46] and i like this and she went and did
[43:48] according to the saint of elijah
[43:50] and she and her house did eat many days
[43:54] when we come to that place in our lives
[43:56] lord
[43:58] at thy word i will do what you said
[44:01] i will take you at your word and go
[44:03] there and trust in that
[44:05] and look at her blessing it says and did
[44:07] he many days
[44:09] again god knew that daniel would be
[44:12] found
[44:12] him in this group did daniel know
[44:16] no daniel went i'm captive i'm caught
[44:19] we've been taken captive.
[44:22] now a person in prayer a person that has
[44:25] a relationship with god a person that
[44:27] has
[44:27] has known god and met god you're still
[44:30] human you still have those thoughts you
[44:32] still have those fears
[44:33] but something down inside of you says
[44:35] god has is in control
[44:37] there's a reason for this and that's
[44:39] what brings the peace in someone's life
[44:43] not because you can see the end not
[44:46] because
[44:46] he's given you a vision god's word says
[44:49] in romans 2
[44:50] 8 28 all things happen for our good
[44:54] all things even the things we don't like
[44:57] sometimes
[44:58] it says let's go on and the king
[45:01] appointed them a daily provision of the
[45:03] king's meat
[45:04] and of the wine which he drank so
[45:06] nourishing them three years
[45:08] that at the end thereof they might stand
[45:10] before the king
[45:12] now among these were the children of
[45:14] judah daniel hananiah
[45:16] michelle and azariah
[45:20] unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave
[45:22] names for
[45:23] he gave daniel the name of belches
[45:26] hazard and to hanonais of shadrach and
[45:28] to michelle
[45:29] meshach and azariah of abednego
[45:33] but daniel purposed in his heart that he
[45:35] would not defile himself with a portion
[45:37] of the king's meat
[45:39] nor with the wine which he drank
[45:40] therefore he requested of the prince of
[45:42] the eunuchs that he might not defile
[45:44] himself
[45:47] the last verse now god had brought
[45:49] daniel into favor
[45:51] and tender love with the prince of the
[45:53] eunuchs
[45:54] so who was in charge of this whole thing
[45:57] god was
[45:59] now we know because we have the
[46:02] scriptures
[46:03] everything what happened there's 15
[46:05] chapters in the book of daniel
[46:07] but daniel didn't know but he purposed
[46:11] in his heart not to defile himself
[46:15] and when you you get into a situation in
[46:17] your life something comes up something's
[46:19] different you're going into something
[46:21] you purpose in your heart god i don't
[46:25] understand the reason why
[46:26] i don't know why i'm in this position i
[46:29] don't know
[46:30] how i got here or why i'm into this but
[46:33] i purpose
[46:34] in my heart not to defile not to put
[46:38] down
[46:38] not to cause anything that would speak
[46:41] against you
[46:42] lord i don't understand the reason why
[46:46] but i purpose in my heart to stay true
[46:48] to the lord
[46:49] that's what daniel did here and god
[46:51] allowed him to find
[46:52] favor amongst his teachers
[46:56] now we know the read the story we could
[46:58] read all 15 chapters of daniel but i
[47:01] just wanted to
[47:02] tell you god did this
[47:05] god prepared the place for him to be
[47:08] because there was going to be a dream
[47:10] that was going to come by the king
[47:14] there was going to be prophetic that was
[47:16] going to speak of the times to come
[47:18] and daniel had to be there in order to
[47:20] interpret the dream
[47:23] because god had purposed that already to
[47:25] say so we could look in the scriptures
[47:27] today and we would know
[47:28] just know what was going to be happening
[47:30] even in our time
[47:33] daniel didn't know that but god did
[47:37] we think about daniel and the lion's den
[47:39] we think about the three hebrew children
[47:41] there
[47:42] when they're the young men when they're
[47:43] in the coming into the furnace
[47:46] they didn't know it would come to that
[47:47] but look what they purposed in their
[47:49] heart
[47:50] we will not bow down to the king
[47:53] even if he does not deliver us
[47:57] sometimes if we're not careful lord if
[47:59] you'll do this
[48:00] then i'll do that
[48:04] but what if we just take not my will
[48:07] but thy will be done lord and let him
[48:09] have his way
[48:11] because who knows better than him but to
[48:14] see that god had purposed this
[48:17] god made preparation for his purpose
[48:20] daniel had to be taken
[48:21] captive and taken into here with it with
[48:24] the king and all
[48:26] to allow god's word to come to pass
[48:30] and when we say lord i surrender use me
[48:34] you're allowing god to do what he wants
[48:36] to do
[48:37] you can sit there in the book of daniel
[48:39] for a long time all the things that god
[48:42] showed and is unveiled to us today
[48:45] because one man purposed in his heart
[48:47] that he would not defile
[48:49] himself before
[48:54] after daniel we'd go into luke chapter
[48:58] 19
[48:58] verse 1-5 and jesus entered
[49:02] in pastor jericho and behold there was a
[49:04] man named zacchaeus
[49:07] which was the chief among the publicans
[49:09] and he was rich
[49:11] and he sought to see jesus who he was
[49:14] and could not for the for the press
[49:16] because he was of little
[49:17] stature uh we would say he was short
[49:21] no but he wanted to see who jesus was he
[49:23] had heard of jesus
[49:24] he knew he was coming and maybe
[49:26] zacchaeus thought and this is just as me
[49:28] my supposings zacchaeus thought is there
[49:31] a profit to be made in this
[49:34] i've made some money on everything else
[49:36] i've ventured into could we make some
[49:37] money on this situation
[49:40] because the bible says why would it say
[49:43] i was rich he was chief of mob why he
[49:45] was rich he had taken advantage okay
[49:48] he says let's go on and he ran before
[49:52] and he climbed up
[49:53] into a sycamore tree to see him for he
[49:56] was to pass that way
[49:58] now the sycamore tree was already there
[50:02] god didn't say oh my goodness zacchaeus
[50:04] i've got to go meet zacchaeus down there
[50:06] but he's too
[50:07] short what do i do do i get no there was
[50:09] a tree there
[50:10] god says i got to go past that way
[50:12] because zacchaeus is going to need to
[50:13] see me he's going to climb up on the
[50:15] tree
[50:16] now when did that tree get planted there
[50:18] i don't know but it was ready for that
[50:19] day
[50:21] god has looked down in your life and
[50:23] where you've gone
[50:25] where you've been through it i'm not
[50:26] saying that at times we haven't caused
[50:29] god to have to delay sometimes to have
[50:31] to push it because
[50:32] we look at some of the things that
[50:34] happen and you say lord if i had
[50:35] accepted you then
[50:37] had i turned my heart to then maybe i'd
[50:38] have gone through this
[50:41] and even brother branham said sometimes
[50:42] sometimes god allowed those things
[50:44] because he knew
[50:45] which choice he would make we wish we
[50:48] would have made every choice perfect the
[50:49] first time
[50:50] i never had to but maybe we'd be a bunch
[50:53] of little spoiled brats tail
[50:55] getting everything we want the first
[50:57] time
[50:59] and when jesus came to that place he
[51:01] looked up and saw him i don't think
[51:03] jesus just decided to look up in the
[51:05] tree for
[51:06] well there's a tree let's see what it
[51:08] looks like i think he knew that kiss was
[51:10] in the tree already
[51:11] he had already known what was coming to
[51:13] place and he said unto zacchaeus make
[51:15] haste
[51:16] and come down for today i must
[51:19] abide at thy house so god was
[51:22] on his way to zacchaeus house already
[51:27] but zacchaeus was going to climb up a
[51:29] tree to look upon jesus because he'd
[51:31] heard about him and
[51:32] based on the scriptures again i'm just
[51:34] assuming this i'm just saying
[51:36] zacchaeus is looking to see how he could
[51:40] profit from this because everything else
[51:42] he had done
[51:43] he had already made a profit he had
[51:45] already put some money in his bag
[51:48] he had no idea what prophet he would be
[51:50] making out of this
[51:52] an eternal prophet for his soul god
[51:56] was making his way down to zacchaeus
[51:58] house there was a tree there
[52:00] zacchaeus climbs a tree but god had seen
[52:02] it already
[52:04] if you it as time goes on you can look
[52:06] back at your life
[52:08] and say that was god that was god
[52:11] that was god it made me think a little
[52:13] bit
[52:14] during this time when i was saying when
[52:16] we first heard the message
[52:18] back around late 74 early 75
[52:22] brother daniel ramirez some of you
[52:24] remember brother daniel
[52:26] was good friends with brother isaac
[52:28] noriega and brother daniel had received
[52:30] the message
[52:31] and he took it to his friend brother
[52:32] isaac noriega
[52:34] whose father was the pastor of the
[52:36] pentecostal church
[52:37] that my mother attended a little later
[52:40] in life
[52:42] when we would go visit grandma in
[52:43] california and go to the apostolic
[52:45] church
[52:46] brother isaac's father was a pastor
[52:47] there so there was
[52:49] a relationship between the jacon family
[52:51] and the noriega family already
[52:54] by chance no god knew this
[52:59] because brother daniel ramirez takes the
[53:00] message
[53:02] to brother isaac noriega who then passes
[53:05] it to my mom's side of the family
[53:07] who then they bring it to my our family
[53:09] down in southern california
[53:11] now right about the time that that
[53:13] happened my father injured his back
[53:16] in construction we lived in southern
[53:19] california my dad came home one day from
[53:21] work
[53:21] he was he was a cement worked with
[53:23] cement
[53:25] and those of you that know me you'll see
[53:28] us some similarities between my dad we
[53:30] like to play around we like to do things
[53:31] like that the girls know it quite well
[53:34] you know sometimes they're looking at me
[53:36] are you serious are you not are you just
[53:37] pulling on a beer
[53:39] you know but dad came home parked the
[53:42] truck he got out and he was literally
[53:44] bent over walking like this
[53:48] and the three of us boys saw dad when he
[53:50] came home and but
[53:52] that was not surprising because dad
[53:53] would do things like that
[53:56] middle of the night we had a wood screen
[53:58] door and it would bang in the storm
[54:00] and dad would call out and say aaron go
[54:01] see who's knocking at the door
[54:04] and it's all dark and aaron would get
[54:06] scared because dad could do it every day
[54:08] and i'd still get scared because i was
[54:09] supposed to go look at the door but dad
[54:11] was just playing
[54:11] we were kind of used to that so dad's
[54:14] walking around like that and i still
[54:15] remember
[54:16] saying okay dad this joke has gone long
[54:18] enough straighten up
[54:20] because we thought dad was playing but
[54:23] dad had injured his back and it was
[54:25] three months three to six months the dad
[54:28] struggled with that
[54:30] now you would look and say well that
[54:32] couldn't be but
[54:33] because of that it set a place
[54:36] for this message to come and for us to
[54:39] leave california
[54:40] and come to tucson god knew that
[54:45] now you know dad could testify to it all
[54:47] the things he went through
[54:49] moving from california getting here the
[54:51] the he had a union pension and social
[54:53] security and all that
[54:55] which had not been established yet we
[54:56] got here
[54:58] paid everything off that we owed in
[55:00] california
[55:01] got here with enough money to to buy a
[55:04] home cash
[55:05] and that was about all but god
[55:09] then meets the need the doctor told my
[55:11] father that he was going to go the
[55:14] back injuries was a whole lot more
[55:16] different than today
[55:17] there's things that they could do today
[55:19] that they didn't even think of back then
[55:21] this was
[55:21] 1976 you know the stuff they do with
[55:24] lasers and all the things that they do
[55:26] now
[55:27] and they told my dad that you are going
[55:29] to go through the most serious or the
[55:31] most
[55:31] painful back uh test that we're gonna do
[55:35] so dad called the ministers they came
[55:37] over and prayed for him while he was
[55:38] there in the hospital bed and this is
[55:39] his testimony
[55:41] and he fell asleep as the test was
[55:43] starting and he woke up when it was done
[55:45] and didn't feel anything but the bed was
[55:48] wet
[55:49] with a sweat god touched him
[55:53] healed his back
[55:56] the evidence of the injury stayed there
[55:58] therefore he was able to connect
[56:00] uh can uh receive the pensions and all
[56:03] and for the next 30 years or so
[56:05] he did missionary work in mexico central
[56:07] and south america
[56:09] god knew that now ask lord injure my
[56:12] back so i could do that no i would never
[56:14] ask that
[56:16] but god did that some of the things in
[56:19] our life we would look back and see god
[56:21] had a reason
[56:22] and he made preparation to fulfill his
[56:24] problem his purpose
[56:28] now there's a song that says we'll
[56:29] understand it
[56:31] in the by-and-by and i don't know that
[56:34] if there's going to be a questions and
[56:36] answer series in heaven
[56:38] if there's going to be a room wrong but
[56:39] but you know what i don't think it'll
[56:41] really matter then
[56:43] i'm home we're safe praise god
[56:46] but he realize that god is still the
[56:48] same yesterday today and forever
[56:52] after zacchaeus we would look here at
[56:57] in john the book of john
[57:03] i've always liked this this story here
[57:06] he left judea the speaking of jesus
[57:09] and departed again in the galley and he
[57:12] must needs
[57:13] go through samaria
[57:16] he had to go there was something he had
[57:19] to go
[57:20] do now we know the story this is about
[57:23] this
[57:24] the samaritan woman we know that he
[57:26] tells his disciples
[57:28] to go over to the town that was close by
[57:30] and go get some food and things
[57:32] i always felt that the reason he told
[57:34] that is because the disciples might not
[57:36] understand what he was doing
[57:38] when he goes to the well
[57:42] because he's going to meet a woman that
[57:44] is
[57:45] of a bad reputation that the men
[57:47] especially
[57:48] christian men shouldn't be around
[57:52] you know but he says he left judea and
[57:54] departed into galilee and he must needs
[57:56] go through samaria
[57:58] then cometh he to a city of samaria
[58:00] which is called sikhar
[58:02] near the parcel of ground that jo jacob
[58:04] gave
[58:05] to his son joseph now i like that it
[58:07] describes where it came
[58:10] jacob gave this to his son joseph to put
[58:12] a well there because there was a woman
[58:14] of samaria that was going to need to be
[58:16] at a well
[58:17] so jesus could meet her there
[58:22] if water was then if water had been
[58:25] brought and delivered to her house
[58:27] she would not been at the well but he
[58:30] must need to go through samaria
[58:33] now jacob's well was there jesus
[58:36] therefore being wearied with his journey
[58:38] sat thus on the well and it was about
[58:41] the sixth hour and jesus says man i'm
[58:44] glad there's a well here i needed a
[58:46] place to sit down and some water to
[58:47] drink
[58:49] no it already said he knew he had to go
[58:51] that way
[58:52] and there was a reason why there cometh
[58:54] a woman with samara
[58:56] to draw water and jesus says unto her
[58:59] give me to drink and her what's her
[59:02] response
[59:03] wait a minute why are you doing it even
[59:06] she has a question
[59:07] why are you here because you know why
[59:09] i'm here at this time
[59:11] i'm not allowed to come with the virgins
[59:13] i'm not allowed to come with
[59:15] the good sisters my reputation is
[59:18] you know but go but jesus says there's a
[59:20] reason why
[59:22] today is a day of your salvation
[59:25] and all of this was prepared all of this
[59:28] was ready all of this was planned
[59:30] by god
[59:34] and those of you that have lived long
[59:36] enough and experienced enough
[59:38] you can look back now and say that was
[59:40] god
[59:41] that was god and that was god therefore
[59:45] if that was god
[59:46] then looking down the road this way that
[59:48] will be god
[59:49] that will be god and that will be god it
[59:52] hasn't changed
[59:53] we know the story of that he begins to
[59:55] speak to her
[59:56] and she tells them i said you know you
[59:58] shouldn't have anything to do with me
[1:00:00] and he tells her draw me some water and
[1:00:04] and
[1:00:04] began to lay and what is the day of the
[1:00:06] visit the visitation for her salvation
[1:00:09] she gets up and she runs into the city
[1:00:11] and says come says her husband
[1:00:13] some years ago and he was close to 70
[1:00:15] years old
[1:00:17] when he gave his heart to the lord
[1:00:20] but it came that time yes she gave her
[1:00:22] heart his lord
[1:00:23] he was with her all this time but it was
[1:00:26] until he was close to 70 years old
[1:00:28] that we baptized him up here brother
[1:00:29] branham is on the other side
[1:00:31] remember beyond the curtain of time and
[1:00:33] a sister comes up to him and says my
[1:00:35] precious brother he says you don't know
[1:00:37] me she says no
[1:00:38] she goes i was 90 years old when i gave
[1:00:40] my heart to the lord
[1:00:44] god has a time god has a place god has a
[1:00:47] purpose
[1:00:48] and it will come to pass because
[1:00:51] he never fails so i want us to listen
[1:00:55] to this it's about between 13 and 15
[1:00:58] minutes long
[1:01:00] from the message i know my redeemer
[1:01:02] liveth
[1:01:03] and a brother had had posted this a
[1:01:05] portion of this
[1:01:06] quote of this portion of the message and
[1:01:09] i read it and it fits so perfect
[1:01:12] so i opened it up to read it and you
[1:01:15] read one then you read two chapters then
[1:01:16] you go down i say well how do i
[1:01:17] eliminate i can't leave that out and i
[1:01:19] began to read and i said well we can
[1:01:20] just play it
[1:01:21] and we can hear it also if the brothers
[1:01:23] would would then it's
[1:01:25] i know my redeemer liveth and as it's
[1:01:28] finishing up
[1:01:30] sister martha it's about 13 minutes long
[1:01:34] just kind of right about there and then
[1:01:35] the musicians can come up so
[1:01:37] let's listen to that
[1:01:47] then there is nothing can destroy us
[1:01:51] until god's purpose is fulfilled
[1:01:57] nothing can harm us until
[1:02:01] that purpose that god has perished here
[1:02:04] far
[1:02:05] has been made manifest
[1:02:10] no matter how much trouble we have
[1:02:13] how much heartaches our sorrows that we
[1:02:16] go through
[1:02:18] all of these are reasons
[1:02:21] and there's a reason for it
[1:02:26] we will take for instance noah
[1:02:29] in the bible there was a flood
[1:02:33] that came on
[1:02:36] and all the earth was destroyed
[1:02:41] the vegetation and
[1:02:44] everything was destroyed but noah
[1:02:48] and the seed that he had taken into the
[1:02:52] earth
[1:02:54] god's purpose can never be
[1:02:57] defeated there is
[1:03:01] nothing can defeated
[1:03:04] so how happy are we to be today
[1:03:09] resting upon that beautiful
[1:03:12] revelation of the word of the living
[1:03:16] god that there
[1:03:19] is neither things present
[1:03:22] nor things that can come
[1:03:26] there's no sickness no sorrow no
[1:03:29] death no perils
[1:03:32] nor nothing can separate us from the
[1:03:35] purpose
[1:03:36] of the living god
[1:03:40] what god has imagined in his mind
[1:03:43] what god has purposed in his heart to
[1:03:46] bring to pass
[1:03:47] there is no demon there is no
[1:03:50] power there is nothing
[1:03:54] can ever separate god's great
[1:03:57] immortal inter-eternal plan
[1:04:02] it must be as god has said
[1:04:08] then we find that in the days
[1:04:12] that all of the world was going to be
[1:04:15] destroyed by a flood
[1:04:18] that god made a preparation
[1:04:22] a preparation for what caused
[1:04:26] to preserve his purpose
[1:04:30] he did it in the days of noah
[1:04:35] and he's doing it today
[1:04:39] he has made a preparation
[1:04:43] to conserve to his own purpose
[1:04:47] he will conserve a church he will
[1:04:51] conserve a people
[1:04:53] he will conserve subjects for his great
[1:04:56] domain
[1:04:58] that death cannot destroy
[1:05:04] and we realize that it is by faith that
[1:05:06] we believe in it
[1:05:08] but the resurrection produces a solid
[1:05:12] foundation on which our faith rests
[1:05:16] nothing can destroy
[1:05:21] the poet once wrote oh what a
[1:05:24] foretaste of glory divine
[1:05:29] aerosalvation purchase of god
[1:05:32] borned off his spirit washed in his
[1:05:35] blood
[1:05:37] what an assurance upon
[1:05:40] this solid rock the resurrection of our
[1:05:44] blessed
[1:05:45] lover the lord jesus
[1:05:49] nothing can destroy it it has been
[1:05:52] planted
[1:05:53] it is the seed of god it is a purpose of
[1:05:56] god
[1:05:57] to give us the blessed holy spirit
[1:06:01] it is the purpose of god to show us
[1:06:03] signs and wonders and miracles
[1:06:07] it's the purpose of god and nothing
[1:06:10] can destroy it
[1:06:13] all powers of hell might wager against
[1:06:17] it but it will prevail we have god's
[1:06:20] eternal promises
[1:06:23] there may be teachers there may be isms
[1:06:26] rise
[1:06:27] there may be great programs rise there
[1:06:31] may be
[1:06:31] things that look like that it would be
[1:06:33] destroyed but it can
[1:06:35] never be destroyed it is the purpose of
[1:06:39] god to see that it will prevail
[1:06:43] that is not up to me and it's not
[1:06:46] up to you whether it will be destroyed
[1:06:49] or not it's up to
[1:06:50] god and we can rest assured on it
[1:06:54] that god will never let our heritage be
[1:06:56] destroyed
[1:06:58] for it's his purpose to give it to us
[1:07:01] now we would think also today upon
[1:07:06] destructions trying to destroy
[1:07:11] we have christ on promise
[1:07:15] we think of the hebrew children
[1:07:18] when god had a purpose for them
[1:07:22] when they were down in babylon
[1:07:25] and the furnace was hit
[1:07:29] seven times hotter than it ever was
[1:07:32] heated to destroy
[1:07:35] the purpose of god
[1:07:40] and the whole fabulous honor rage
[1:07:46] they were determined satan was to
[1:07:49] destroy
[1:07:50] the purpose of god for he knew those
[1:07:53] children
[1:07:54] was going into the furnace
[1:07:58] so he made the furnace when they heated
[1:08:00] it
[1:08:01] seven times hotter to be sure
[1:08:04] that the program of god would be
[1:08:08] destroyed
[1:08:10] but god wanted to display his power
[1:08:15] and all babylon and all hell could not
[1:08:18] defeat
[1:08:19] that purpose no sir
[1:08:23] no matter if they could have heated
[1:08:24] furnace a million
[1:08:26] times hotter it would have never
[1:08:29] destroyed the purpose of god
[1:08:33] god wanted to show that he was a god of
[1:08:36] deliverance
[1:08:39] and he'd bring deliverance to whoever he
[1:08:42] desired to bring him
[1:08:43] and nothing would interfere with his
[1:08:46] program
[1:08:48] so when they heated the furnace little
[1:08:51] did
[1:08:52] shadrach meshach and abednego
[1:08:55] know that they were coming from that
[1:08:57] furnace
[1:08:59] for they said themselves our
[1:09:02] god is able to deliver us
[1:09:06] but nevertheless we will not bow to the
[1:09:09] image
[1:09:11] god had someone who would serve him
[1:09:15] and his purpose would not be defeated
[1:09:19] fire can not cannot defeat the purpose
[1:09:23] of god's plan
[1:09:28] i know how i'd love to say this this
[1:09:31] morning
[1:09:32] all the hydrogen bombs in the world
[1:09:36] can never defeat the resurrection of his
[1:09:39] church
[1:09:43] all explaining away and all of the
[1:09:46] mathematics and
[1:09:48] and so forth that this intelligent world
[1:09:50] has
[1:09:52] disguised to your purpose to do
[1:09:54] something about to destroy
[1:09:56] the faith of god's children it will
[1:09:59] never
[1:10:00] do it that
[1:10:03] faith will live on forever
[1:10:08] it was the purpose of god to show that
[1:10:12] he had
[1:10:12] power over the wild beasts of the fields
[1:10:17] and they put some lines in a cave one
[1:10:20] time
[1:10:22] and they had starved them until they
[1:10:24] were so hungry
[1:10:26] that they could lean in on everlasting
[1:10:31] on i have blessed peace with
[1:10:36] my lord so near leaning
