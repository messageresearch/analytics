[28:03] amen God bless you
[28:05] all it's a good day to be a Christian
[28:08] every day is a good day good day to be a
[28:11] Christian um before we get started
[28:14] there's a couple announcements I want to
[28:15] make uh first we have uh our brother Eli
[28:19] Castillo is going to be preaching for us
[28:22] on this uh this coming Sunday morning
[28:25] and then on Sunday night I've been
[28:28] praying about what to do and I had in my
[28:31] mind I was listening to um to a
[28:35] service and uh I've been going over and
[28:37] over and over in the past past week or
[28:40] so past couple weeks and it just brother
[28:43] brandom lays out such a
[28:47] beautiful doctrines he talks about
[28:49] serpent seed and he talks about marriage
[28:51] and divorce and he talks about the
[28:54] godhead and he talks about baptism and
[28:57] he he he talks about just so many
[28:59] wonderful things and I thought this
[29:00] would be really really good for the
[29:03] church to hear and I was praying about
[29:06] it and uh I felt like the Lord said no
[29:10] that's that's not what I want for this
[29:13] Sunday and I said okay and then I
[29:15] started praying about maybe he wanted me
[29:17] to minister on Sunday
[29:19] night and um I felt like no he didn't
[29:22] want that either um so and uh
[29:28] then a couple of the brothers brother
[29:30] Marlon there's one of them and and
[29:32] another
[29:33] brother um gave me a couple testimonies
[29:37] and and I said well maybe maybe that's
[29:39] what the Lord wants for this Sunday
[29:41] evening so I I prayed about that and I
[29:44] felt like the Lord said yes that's
[29:47] that's where the direction we should go
[29:49] on Sunday night now I could be mistaken
[29:52] about that um as I always say the Lord
[29:54] willing so we're going to continue to
[29:57] put that before him but the Lord willing
[30:00] Sunday morning brother eleazer Castillo
[30:02] will be ministering and then Sunday
[30:04] night we will have testimony and praise
[30:06] service brother Marlon are you good for
[30:09] Sunday night good good well it's I think
[30:12] it's going to be a
[30:14] blessing to all of us um and uh the
[30:18] prayer requests prayer requests that our
[30:20] Brother Marlin
[30:23] mentioned he's coming from the Amish
[30:26] community
[30:28] and there's when people believe that
[30:32] they have the message of the hour when
[30:35] people believe that this is the only
[30:40] right
[30:41] way then when you start to see Lord
[30:45] might have a a higher Revelation for me
[30:48] or or maybe that no you're not quite
[30:50] right in the way that you think there's
[30:53] something that always comes in and that
[30:56] is fear
[30:58] and that fear will it'll start to
[31:01] consume your thoughts and and the people
[31:04] that love you the most they are fearing
[31:06] that you're sinning or that you're
[31:08] straying from the Lord and it's it's
[31:11] something that Satan uses that we should
[31:14] never ever we shouldn't have any part of
[31:16] it in our own lives how many times did
[31:19] Jesus say and did the angel say when
[31:21] they come from the Lord fear not we
[31:24] should not have any fear if we believe
[31:26] that we are moving right in the Lord
[31:29] then we have nothing to fear because God
[31:33] is with us and when God is with us yes
[31:36] we will make mistakes because we're
[31:38] carnal but if God is with us he's going
[31:40] to take these mistakes and he's going to
[31:42] work them out for the best so brother
[31:44] Marlon I know my brother I think I I can
[31:47] I know how you feel and don't fear don't
[31:50] fear don't you feel for your family
[31:52] either because God knows who they are
[31:55] God God loves them you just pray for
[31:58] them put them in the hands of the Lord
[31:59] and let me tell you something if you've
[32:01] ever heard anything that I say listen to
[32:02] this God's hands are better than your
[32:05] hands they're better than my hands so
[32:08] put them into his hands and all will be
[32:11] well we have a special couple of special
[32:16] visitors tonight neither one of them

[32:48] brother minister of the gospel and um

[32:57] uh special another special guest and
[32:59] somebody that's very special to me and
[33:03] that's our brother meno freen here um
[33:07] people know brother meno from around the
[33:09] world he is a true pillar when we talk
[33:15] about brother brandom's message and we
[33:18] talk about what has happened over the
[33:22] years and it's gone around the world
[33:25] brother meno has been a man
[33:27] that so many of us can look towards and
[33:32] say that man is the man that brother
[33:35] brandom described as a true
[33:38] Christian um brother menow do you have a
[33:40] few minutes that you could come and
[33:41] greet the congregation and sing or take
[33:45] the
[33:47] service whatever would be on your heart
[33:49] my brother please please come
[33:55] up
[34:15] thank
[34:16] you number one brother God bless you all
[34:19] tonight it's uh good to be here it's a
[34:23] familiar place I kind of missed it this
[34:26] year no Harmony in the
[34:27] desert uh one of the brothers called me
[34:30] and I said find out if there's Harmony
[34:32] in the desert he called me said no no
[34:35] Harmony in the desert no pun
[34:41] intended but uh I know there's Harmony
[34:44] in the desert there's Harmony in Christ
[34:46] Jesus amen I I appreciate that brother
[34:49] Dan uh one of the good reasons why we
[34:52] know this message is right because the
[34:55] pillar of fire is going before us
[34:58] remember the pillar of fire returned in
[35:00] this day to pick up a
[35:02] bride this is the message itself it's a
[35:05] Vindicated
[35:07] message not just enthused or excited
[35:10] about something but it's the Vindicated
[35:12] word promised Living Word in this
[35:16] day and brother Craig good to see
[35:19] you I don't know where you've land Ed up
[35:21] is this year just visiting right oh yeah
[35:24] kind of thought and um uh Ohio just got
[35:28] the best of you and it took off out of
[35:29] there I understand and I don't think
[35:31] I've seen you since you left Ohio I'm
[35:34] not so sure well we both come from there
[35:36] Ohio is a good place to come from but
[35:38] also go some precious Saints around the
[35:41] world and I'm not sure are you sister
[35:45] schs daughter right right I I you know
[35:48] what at my age you're kind of uh there's
[35:50] a lot of things get gray but your mama
[35:53] fed us real good last February when we
[35:56] were at her house house it was a great
[35:57] great reunion in that area and U I'm uh
[36:01] I'm I hate to think of how long I go
[36:02] back but it's been a long long time I've
[36:05] been on this road and it's been a good
[36:07] road um I wouldn't trade it for anything
[36:10] because I know I started when I was
[36:13] young and um um the Lord started it
[36:16] rather but I believe he started it
[36:18] before the foundation of the world and
[36:20] uh it's so nice to know that you've
[36:22] always
[36:23] been and that you're not that you're
[36:26] just dropping into a a sphere here to uh
[36:29] uh fulfill what God already
[36:32] foresaw but we didn't know it we didn't
[36:35] know we were we didn't know we were
[36:36] predestinated we didn't know if we were
[36:38] coming or going but one day that still
[36:42] Small Voice that inner man begin to be
[36:44] quickened and U I'm so grateful that
[36:48] this match is you know I feel like
[36:49] brother Bram said that time about his
[36:51] own uh uh struggles and trials that he
[36:54] had and uh you know when that doctor
[36:57] said uh uh did you keep your religion
[37:00] through all this trial when his wife
[37:02] died and baby died and said did you keep
[37:04] your religion he said no sir he said My
[37:06] Religion kept me and I get I just guess
[37:09] I've been a Christian since about 19 oh
[37:13] 60 and all these years I can only say
[37:16] one
[37:17] thing I didn't keep myself he kept me
[37:21] with all the confusions around
[37:23] reality there's only one can keep you
[37:27] one of the greatest things that we can
[37:28] do in the middle of this age is to keep
[37:30] our heads spiritually speaking about all
[37:33] the fanaticism that follows the true
[37:36] word but that's where Satan zeroed in
[37:38] he's got the
[37:40] rest and uh I'm just so glad tonight to
[37:43] say this uh this world is not our home I
[37:47] was going along a while and just uh
[37:49] since he take take a little liberty so I
[37:50] just say this I want to do you know
[37:52] Palms of Victory you know that song now
[37:54] you we'll do the we'll try the best we
[37:56] can can D you learned it oh did
[38:02] you I was driving along one day you like
[38:05] we all do and we get to get alone talk
[38:07] to the Lord and and
[38:09] uh uh something we talk you know how we
[38:12] think about our conditions you know our
[38:14] wife our family our children and and
[38:16] always praying Lord um I like those
[38:20] promises that say and thou and thy house
[38:23] shalt be
[38:24] saved and thou and thy Offspring with
[38:27] thee we like to use those quotes because
[38:30] that's God's promise and the one thing
[38:32] we do confession is to say the same
[38:36] thing that he said and I say oh I
[38:39] confess this I confess just confess what
[38:41] he said if he said you had eternal life
[38:43] before the foundation of the world and
[38:45] predestined on the adoption of sons say
[38:47] amen that's
[38:49] confession but I was driving along and
[38:51] something said you know you don't own a
[38:52] single thing on this
[38:55] Earth you don't take there's not one
[38:58] thing you own on this
[39:01] Earth if you're a millionaire today you
[39:04] don't own it the time you pass by the
[39:08] grave you take nothing with you but
[39:10] there's one thing we take with us the
[39:13] supernatural character of the
[39:15] Soul I'm so glad that's the part that
[39:19] makes me happy you know and this little
[39:22] song says it pretty good doesn't always
[39:25] say the words like we heard him in this
[39:27] age but but we're pilgrims we're
[39:29] strangers here seeking a city whose
[39:32] building maker is God so that was the
[39:35] character of our great great father
[39:38] Abraham the father of the faith which of
[39:40] course was
[39:41] Christ but he was a pilgrim and stranger
[39:44] on this Earth all my life that I've
[39:47] walked and I think and I keep looking
[39:48] over my shoulder one of these mornings
[39:50] the dead in Christ rise amen I saw
[39:54] Wayward Traveler in garments SED clad he

[43:44] tell you what that's two good good book
[43:46] ends to be
[43:47] between so for tonight um let's let's
[43:51] all stand for tonight uh we will
[43:54] continue on for our visitors
[43:56] what we're doing is we've devoted our
[43:58] Wednesday night service to a Bible
[44:01] study and the the first time we did this
[44:04] we went through the book of Acts and we
[44:06] went chapter by chapter word by word all
[44:09] the way through the book of Acts it took
[44:11] us uh I don't know the better part of a
[44:12] year to do it and uh the people enjoyed
[44:16] it and I believe that it was edifying to
[44:19] the body so I I was praying and I
[44:22] thought Lord what would you want to do
[44:25] this was a real blessing how do you want
[44:27] us to handle Wednesday nights do you
[44:28] want us to continue on with this Bible
[44:30] study the thought came to my mind let's
[44:33] start in Genesis and let's just go
[44:35] through the whole Bible book by book
[44:39] service by service so we started in
[44:41] Genesis now we're in the book of second
[44:44] Samuel we're on the second half of 2
[44:46] Samuel we know that the book of 1 Samuel
[44:49] we had an introduction to what some
[44:52] people call the last judge this great
[44:55] one of the greatest prophets has ever
[44:57] walked the Earth his name was Samuel and
[44:59] we know that Samuel anointed this King
[45:04] Saul and Saul served the Lord a little
[45:06] while and then he um he
[45:10] failed got himself in the way and um it
[45:14] wasn't just a couple years into his
[45:15] ministry into his kingdom that he failed
[45:18] and the Lord turned his eyes to David
[45:21] Saul continued on he ended
[45:24] up being the king for 40
[45:27] years and
[45:29] now the um the blessing has passed to
[45:33] this man David I went through the first
[45:36] brother Lyall last week went through the
[45:37] first part of the book we saw how David
[45:40] was truly as a man after God's Own Heart
[45:43] but even that he was still a man he was
[45:48] still a human being and he still failed
[45:51] and it was we ended the service last
[45:54] week and it it seemed like a sad note
[45:57] but then brother Joe gave a testimony
[46:00] about how he made a mistake and he
[46:03] called the wrong person and God took
[46:06] that mistake and he turned it into a
[46:09] blessing and that person gave his heart
[46:11] to the Lord and now he's serving the
[46:13] lord in the church that you go to right
[46:16] up uh up in the Frozen country so is the
[46:20] same with David God can take a mistake
[46:23] no matter how bad our mistakes are and
[46:26] he can turn it around and give one of
[46:30] the greatest Kings really that Israel
[46:32] has ever seen the one of the most
[46:34] successful Kings and that is Solomon
[46:36] from David's mistake with basba the the
[46:40] the child died but then later on the
[46:43] lord gave them that blessing so brother
[46:46] ly if you would come brother Aaron if
[46:49] you would sing a song as brother L's
[46:54] coming hey he is my
[46:59] everything he is my

[48:54] evening
[49:01] green lights on the green lights
[49:04] on there we go we have a green light we
[49:06] can go once again we have the privilege
[49:10] of opening our Bibles and seeing what
[49:12] the Lord has for us from its Pages this
[49:15] evening will conclude the book of 2
[49:20] Samuel when I was a kid in the
[49:23] 1950s there were three te TV networks in
[49:26] major cities 24-hour television didn't
[49:29] exist we live not far from San Francisco
[49:33] so we had all three channels cable
[49:36] didn't exist no cell phones no streaming
[49:39] no internet no email we had an antenna
[49:42] on the roof of the house pointed toward
[49:45] San Francisco as did every other house
[49:47] in our
[49:48] area for a while boxing was the favorite
[49:52] sport carried by all three Networks I
[49:55] remember hearing the sports announcer
[49:57] exclaim thee Wednesday night fights are
[49:59] on the
[50:01] air we never watched the boxing matches
[50:03] but I could hear that announce in my
[50:05] mind as I read this portion of 2 Samuel
[50:08] because this is Wednesday night and the
[50:11] next several chapters are about a big
[50:13] fight a fight over the Throne of the
[50:16] United Kingdom of Israel and Judah and
[50:20] about a nation deeply divided as a
[50:23] result of Sin Sin at the top S at the
[50:40] bottom thank
[50:44] you and just like on those Wednesday
[50:47] nights sometimes we have technical
[50:48] difficulties but but we overcome them
[50:51] and is this is this problem this nation
[50:54] divided as a result of sin is this
[50:56] ancient history or is it today's United
[51:00] States of
[51:01] America before we read our opening
[51:03] scriptures this evening let's approach
[51:05] the Lord one more time and seek his
[51:08] guidance Lord
[51:10] Jesus we're in awe of your
[51:12] word that you inspired men over many
[51:16] years many generations in many places
[51:19] Lord to bring us a love letter it's it's
[51:22] Valentine's Day and you've given us a
[51:25] love love letter as we open its Pages
[51:27] Lord Make It live for us make it live in
[51:29] our hearts Lord bring forth in us what
[51:32] you desire from your word this evening
[51:35] Lord and help us to please you and to
[51:38] serve you and to pursue you we thank you
[51:41] forgive us where we fall short in Jesus
[51:44] name
[51:50] amen while we're still standing we'll
[51:52] read from second s Psalm
[51:57] 32 it's a Psalm that's attributed to
[51:59] David and likely composed during this
[52:01] period that we'll be reading about in 2
[52:03] Samuel it says
[52:05] blessed is he whose
[52:08] transgression is
[52:10] Forgiven not he who never
[52:13] transgresses whose sin is covered
[52:17] blessed is the man un whom the Lord
[52:20] imputeth not iniquity and in whose
[52:23] Spirit there is no gu
[52:27] David says when I kept silence when I
[52:30] didn't confess or confront my sin my
[52:33] bones wax old through my roaring all the
[52:37] day long for day and night thy hand was
[52:41] Heavy upon me my moisture has turned
[52:43] into the drought of
[52:45] Summer sa SAA means stop think about
[52:50] this I acknowledge my sin unto thee and
[52:55] mine iniquity have I not hid I said I
[52:58] will confess my transgressions unto the
[53:02] Lord and thou forgest the iniquity of my
[53:07] sin say
[53:10] la for this shall everyone that is Godly
[53:12] pray unto thee in a time when thou
[53:14] mayest be found surely in the floods of
[53:17] Great Waters they shall not come nigh
[53:19] unto him Thou Art my Hiding Place Thou
[53:23] shalt preserve me from TRU trouble Thou
[53:25] shalt Compass me about with
[53:29] songs of Deliverance Palms of
[53:32] Victory say
[53:35] la I will instruct thee and teach thee
[53:38] in the way which Thou shalt go I will
[53:40] guide thee with mine eye be not as the
[53:42] horse or as the mule which have no
[53:47] understanding whose mouth must be held
[53:48] in with bid and Bridal lest they come
[53:51] near unto me seek work make effort to
[54:00] understand did I hit the wrong one no
[54:03] there we
[54:04] go many Sorrows shall be to the wicked
[54:08] but he that trusteth in the Lord Mercy
[54:10] shall Compass him
[54:12] about and for this reason if no other be
[54:15] glad in the Lord and rejoice ye
[54:18] righteous shout for Joy all ye that are
[54:22] upright in heart
[54:26] please be
[54:30] seated last Wednesday evening we
[54:32] explored the first half of the book of 2
[54:34] Samuel it it began with the death of
[54:37] Saul we followed the life and exploits
[54:39] of David and some of his officials from
[54:41] the beginning of his reign in heon to
[54:44] his conquest of Jerusalem the
[54:47] construction of his Palace and his
[54:49] desire to build a temple for the Lord we
[54:53] also caught glimpses of his dark side
[54:56] saw him destroy one of his Valiant
[54:58] defenders in a vain attempt to cover up
[55:01] his sin a a premeditated
[55:04] transgression followed by premeditated
[55:07] murder which resulted in this prophecy
[55:10] which dominates the second half of the
[55:16] book The Prophet Nathan speaking to
[55:19] David now therefore the sword shall
[55:22] never depart from thine house thy
[55:24] Dynasty thy
[55:25] descendants because thou Hast despised
[55:30] me the Lord you you ignored my commands
[55:33] to a King and has taken the wife of
[55:35] Uriah the hittite to be thy wife thus
[55:38] saith the Lord behold I will raise up
[55:40] evil against thee out of thine own house
[55:44] and I will take thy wives from before
[55:46] thine eyes and give them unto thy
[55:48] neighbor and he shall lie with thy wives
[55:52] in the sight of this son for thou did it
[55:55] secretly but I will do this thing before
[55:57] all Israel before the sun in plain sight
[56:03] openly and and David in sorrowful
[56:06] repentance said unto Nathan I have
[56:09] sinned against the Lord and Nathan said
[56:13] unto David the Lord also put away thy
[56:16] sin Thou shalt not die David your sins
[56:19] forgiven but your Deeds won't go
[56:23] unpunished oh
[56:26] wait it it looks like another edition of
[56:28] The Daily parchment has arrived let's
[56:30] look at the headlines for the remainder
[56:32] of 2
[56:34] Samuel we see many of them related to
[56:37] Absalom one of David's Sons as we expect
[56:41] David is in most of them this is a
[56:45] difficult section of scripture yet in
[56:46] the midst of the turmoil and pain human
[56:50] tragedy and anguish we see glimpses of
[56:53] the Messiah who will come some 10
[56:56] centuries
[57:00] later a little
[57:02] background when David became king of
[57:05] Judah after Saul's death he lived in
[57:08] Hebron for seven
[57:10] years and we read in 2
[57:13] Samuel should say chapter three up there
[57:16] and unto David were Sons born in Hein
[57:19] his first born was amnon and thus the
[57:22] Crown Prince of aoem the
[57:25] jezel and the second kab of Abigail the
[57:29] wife of nabal the carlite and the third
[57:33] Absalon the son of Maka the daughter of
[57:37] talai king of Gasher so that third son
[57:41] was from the result of a political
[57:43] marriage
[57:45] absolum Ammon and absolon pay an
[57:47] important role now as well as David's
[57:49] daughter named Tamara a sister of absum
[57:53] and note that absum is a nephew to talmi
[57:56] the king of Gasher a district then of
[58:01] Syria David's eldest son amnon thinks
[58:05] that he's in love with his half sister
[58:07] Tomar amnon pretends to be sick asks for
[58:10] Tomar to come to his bedside prepare
[58:12] some
[58:13] food he then forces himself on her
[58:15] compounds his sin and her humiliation by
[58:18] sending her away afterward she lives in
[58:20] her brother absalom's house absum plots
[58:24] Revenge
[58:31] two years later at sheep sharing time
[58:34] you might remember sheep sharing time
[58:36] when we studied Genesis and we had the
[58:40] uh incident between Judah and another
[58:43] person named
[58:44] tomor absum convinces David to have all
[58:47] of his sons come this is going to be a
[58:49] big party at the height of it when amnon
[58:53] is drunk absum has him
[58:57] killed the rest of David's Sons Flee for
[59:01] home absolum takes flight to gisher a
[59:05] region not not a town some 8200 miles
[59:07] away recall his mother was the daughter
[59:10] of the king of Gasher so he's going to
[59:11] his uncle for
[59:13] Refuge some three years later having
[59:18] gotten over the death of amnon David
[59:21] Longs to see absolum once more
[59:27] joab the commander of David's Army and a
[59:30] longtime companion seeing the longing in
[59:32] David arranges for a woman to pretend to
[59:34] seek judgment from David she tells a
[59:36] tale that David sees through but by it
[59:40] convinces David to allow absolum to
[59:42] return to Jerusalem David summons joab
[59:44] and asks him to bring absolum back from
[59:47] Exile so joab arose and went to gisher
[59:51] brought absum to Jerusalem and the King
[59:53] said let him return to his own house let
[59:56] him not see my face so absum returned to
[1:00:00] his own house and saw not the king's
[1:00:02] face but in all
[1:00:04] Israel there was none so much praised as
[1:00:09] absolent for his
[1:00:11] character oh didn't say that his
[1:00:15] Integrity uh his wisdom no for the
[1:00:19] vanity of his Beauty from the soulle of
[1:00:23] his foot to the C crown of his head
[1:00:25] there was no blemish in
[1:00:27] him absum is the definition of a
[1:00:31] self-absorbed
[1:00:32] narcissist when he pulled his head that
[1:00:35] means when he cut his
[1:00:38] hair I guess that just happened for it
[1:00:41] was at every Year's End that he cut it
[1:00:43] because the hair was heavy on him
[1:00:44] therefore he cut it he weighed the hair
[1:00:47] of his head I never thought about
[1:00:49] weighing the hair when I had a haircut
[1:00:52] but it weighed 200 shekels after the the
[1:00:54] king's weight this is weight not money
[1:00:56] it's about 5
[1:00:57] lbs I'd be luy to get a half an ounce
[1:01:00] over a period of a
[1:01:02] year but then I'm not unblemished from
[1:01:05] the soulle of my foot to the crown of my
[1:01:06] head either unto absum we read There
[1:01:10] were born three
[1:01:12] sons and one daughter whose name was
[1:01:15] Tamar the same name as his sister she
[1:01:17] was a woman of fair countenance so absum
[1:01:20] dwelt two full years in Jerusalem and
[1:01:24] son the king's face David still wouldn't
[1:01:27] see him he had after all murdered the
[1:01:29] Crown Prince In Cold Blood absum twice
[1:01:33] asked joab to come to him so he can ask
[1:01:35] joab to intervene with David and joab
[1:01:38] doesn't come he refuses to come to absum
[1:01:40] so absum says I how to get his attention
[1:01:43] and he has his servants set joab's
[1:01:45] barleyfields on
[1:01:47] fire not your favorite neighbor then
[1:01:51] joab arose and came to abson to his
[1:01:53] house and said unto him why have thy
[1:01:55] servants set my field on
[1:01:58] fire absum answered joab behold I said
[1:02:03] unto thee saying come hither that I may
[1:02:06] send thee to the king to say wherefore
[1:02:09] am I come from gisher it had been good
[1:02:12] for me to have been there still now
[1:02:14] therefore let me see the king's face and
[1:02:17] if there be any iniquity in me let him
[1:02:20] kill
[1:02:23] me so joab came to the king and told him
[1:02:26] and when he had called for Absalom he
[1:02:28] came to the king and bowed himself on
[1:02:30] his face to the ground before the king
[1:02:33] and the King kissed
[1:02:36] Absalon notice something strange about
[1:02:38] that verse it never says David it says
[1:02:42] the king he's not approaching him as a
[1:02:45] Father's
[1:02:46] son David kissing him in this way is
[1:02:50] emphasizing this is a royal Act of
[1:02:53] Pardon to
[1:02:56] absum
[1:02:58] uhoh next headline absalom's conspiracy
[1:03:02] the stage is now set absum has been
[1:03:05] pardoned by David which then allows
[1:03:07] absum to sit in the gate of Jerusalem an
[1:03:10] ancient times this was a place where
[1:03:12] judges and important officials sat and
[1:03:14] conducted
[1:03:16] business we saw that in the Book of Ruth
[1:03:18] with Boaz he uses this position to build
[1:03:21] favor with all who come through over a
[1:03:23] period of years telling everyone he
[1:03:27] ought to be the judge and he would give
[1:03:29] them Justice he takes their hand kisses
[1:03:33] them the consumate
[1:03:36] politician but there's a difficult
[1:03:38] passage in here let let's read this 2
[1:03:42] Samuel 15:6 on this manner greeting and
[1:03:46] kissing did absam to all Israel that
[1:03:49] came to the king for judgment so Absalom
[1:03:51] stole the hearts of the men of Israel
[1:03:55] and it came to pass after 40 years that
[1:03:57] Absalom said unto the king I pray thee
[1:04:00] let me go and pay my vow which I have
[1:04:03] vowed unto the Lord in
[1:04:06] heon well it's impossible for him to
[1:04:09] have sat in the gate for 40 years and
[1:04:11] then go to David we 25 to 30 years into
[1:04:14] David's 40y year reign now 40 years from
[1:04:17] when absum was pardoned David would have
[1:04:19] been dead for 20 maybe 30
[1:04:22] years so we have to ask what's going on
[1:04:27] what is that 40 years refer to well
[1:04:31] let's take a closer
[1:04:33] look some translations attempt to get
[1:04:36] around this by stating that well the
[1:04:38] text must have been corrupted in ancient
[1:04:40] times it should read four years not 40
[1:04:43] and so you'll see in some translations
[1:04:45] of the Bible they say four years rather
[1:04:47] than
[1:04:47] 40 some commentators claim that well 40
[1:04:50] is a symbolic number it represents
[1:04:53] testing it doesn't really mean 40 years
[1:04:57] it means there's a test that's
[1:04:59] coming brother brandom never spoke on
[1:05:01] this particular verse that I could find
[1:05:04] our guidance from him is God watches
[1:05:07] over his
[1:05:08] word well I I checked the Dead Sea
[1:05:11] Scrolls of the most ancient Hebrew text
[1:05:13] that I could find to see if it would
[1:05:15] shed a little bit of light on this what
[1:05:17] what's going on among all those Scrolls
[1:05:20] there are two copies they came from cave
[1:05:22] 4 scroll 51 and 53 for those of you who
[1:05:25] are Scholars of the Dead Sea
[1:05:29] Scrolls they're both fragmentary as are
[1:05:32] many of the Scrolls one of the copies
[1:05:34] completely lacks verse S the other one
[1:05:37] lacks the part of verse S that includes
[1:05:40] the
[1:05:42] number well however others point out
[1:05:46] that this narrative is detailing a
[1:05:49] conspiracy regarding kingship and
[1:05:52] suggests that the 40 years begins when
[1:05:55] Samuel anointed David to become king in
[1:05:59] 1st Samuel 16:13 we it it says that
[1:06:01] Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed
[1:06:03] David in the midst of his Brethren and
[1:06:05] the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David
[1:06:07] from that day
[1:06:08] forward David took the throne some 10
[1:06:11] between 10 and 20 years after that this
[1:06:14] understanding fits well with the
[1:06:15] timeline of David's Reign the probable
[1:06:18] ages of his children and the rest of the
[1:06:19] events of his life so personally I'm
[1:06:23] going to say that the text isn't
[1:06:25] corrupted and that the 40 years refers
[1:06:27] to the anointing of David to be king by
[1:06:31] Samuel you don't have to accept that
[1:06:33] that's that's how I see it based on this
[1:06:37] evidence getting back to 2 Samuel and
[1:06:39] absol's request of David to allow him to
[1:06:41] go to
[1:06:42] Hein absil goes on to say for thy
[1:06:45] servant vow to vow while I abod at
[1:06:47] Gasher in Syria saying if the Lord shall
[1:06:50] bring me again indeed to Jerusalem then
[1:06:53] I will serve serve the
[1:06:56] Lord absum is manipulating
[1:06:59] David how do you know when absum is
[1:07:03] lying when his lips are moving the king
[1:07:06] said unto him go In Peace So absum arose
[1:07:10] and went to Hein but absum sent spies
[1:07:14] throughout all the tribes of Israel
[1:07:16] saying to these
[1:07:18] coconspirators as soon as you hear the
[1:07:20] sound of the trumpet then ye shall say
[1:07:23] absolum reign and
[1:07:25] heon and with absolum went 200 men out
[1:07:29] of Jerusalem that were called they they
[1:07:31] went in their Simplicity they didn't
[1:07:33] know anything about this they were
[1:07:35] unwitting
[1:07:38] accomplices and absolum sent for aiel
[1:07:43] the gilonite David's counselor from his
[1:07:45] City even from gilo while he absum
[1:07:49] offered sacrifices in Hebron and the
[1:07:51] conspiracy was strong the people people
[1:07:54] increase
[1:07:55] continually with absolum Not only was
[1:07:58] David blinded regarding this yearslong
[1:08:01] conspiracy and undermining of his
[1:08:02] authority but David's advisors
[1:08:05] counselors even the the spies the people
[1:08:07] that he had that heard rumors and
[1:08:09] investigated things they were all either
[1:08:11] blind to it or part of
[1:08:14] it in verse 12 here we see that even one
[1:08:18] from David's Inner Circle of his most
[1:08:20] trusted advisers a hopel abandoned him
[1:08:25] for
[1:08:29] absolum not everyone cast their lot with
[1:08:32] Abraham with Absalom
[1:08:35] sorry there came a messenger to David
[1:08:38] saying the hearts of the men of Israel
[1:08:41] are after
[1:08:42] Absalom David said unto all his servants
[1:08:45] that were with him at Jerusalem arise
[1:08:47] let us flee we shall not escape from
[1:08:49] absolum make speed to depart lest you
[1:08:52] overtake us suddenly and bring evil upon
[1:08:54] us and smite the city with the edge of
[1:08:57] the sword that prophecy the sword will
[1:09:00] not depart David still with the heart of
[1:09:03] his Shepherd if I stick around not only
[1:09:05] will he kill me but these innocent
[1:09:07] people in Jerusalem are going to suffer
[1:09:09] as well we've got to draw these forces
[1:09:12] away the king's servants said unto the
[1:09:14] king Behold thy servants are ready to do
[1:09:17] whatsoever my Lord the king shall
[1:09:21] appoint many come with David I'd read
[1:09:24] this entire chapter with you but for
[1:09:25] time but I encourage you to read it
[1:09:28] maybe you already have as you read your
[1:09:31] Bibles at home in conjunction with a
[1:09:33] series of Wednesday night
[1:09:35] studies David leaves 10 of his
[1:09:37] concubines kind of second rank wives in
[1:09:39] Jerusalem to take care of the
[1:09:43] palace the king said also to zadok the
[1:09:46] priest art thou not a Seer return into
[1:09:49] the city of peace and your two sons with
[1:09:51] you ahas thy son and and Jonathan the
[1:09:54] son of abiatar see I I'll carry in the
[1:09:57] plain of the Wilderness and until to
[1:09:59] come word from you to certify me he's
[1:10:01] setting up a counter Espionage operation
[1:10:04] he wants to find out what's going on
[1:10:07] zadok therefore and abathur carried the
[1:10:09] Ark of God again to Jerusalem and They
[1:10:12] Carried
[1:10:13] there now this next verse is one that
[1:10:17] brother brandham used as a text or
[1:10:19] referred to in at least 30 sermons a
[1:10:22] foreshadow of Jesus Jesus in his final
[1:10:26] days as David went up the
[1:10:32] ascent David went
[1:10:35] up the ascent of Mount olives the future
[1:10:38] Gethsemane and wept as he went up had
[1:10:41] his head covered and he went Barefoot
[1:10:44] and all the people that was with him
[1:10:45] covered every man his head and they went
[1:10:48] up weeping as they
[1:10:51] went and one told David saying hipel is
[1:10:56] among the
[1:10:57] conspirators with
[1:11:02] absolum and David said oh Lord I pray
[1:11:05] thee turn the counsel of a hopel into
[1:11:09] foolishness sometimes the Lord takes a
[1:11:11] while to answer our prayers and
[1:11:13] sometimes they're answered before we
[1:11:15] finish
[1:11:16] asking it came to pass that when David
[1:11:19] was come to the top of the
[1:11:21] mount where he lamented his Misfortune
[1:11:25] and asked God why me no no he knew why
[1:11:30] Nathan had told him the sword would not
[1:11:31] depart from his house instead showing
[1:11:33] his character his heart that God loved
[1:11:37] he gets to the top of the hill and David
[1:11:39] worshiped
[1:11:40] God and behold in worship after that
[1:11:44] request hushai the archite came to meet
[1:11:47] him with his coat rent and Earth upon
[1:11:51] his
[1:11:52] head unto whom David said recognizing
[1:11:56] God had just answered
[1:11:58] him if thou passest on with me then Thou
[1:12:01] shalt be a burden unto me I'll be
[1:12:03] responsible for you but if you return to
[1:12:06] the
[1:12:07] city and say unto Absalom I will be thy
[1:12:11] servant O King as I have been thy
[1:12:13] father's servant
[1:12:15] hitherto so will I now also be thy
[1:12:18] servant then mayest thou for me defeat
[1:12:22] the councel of a
[1:12:25] hopel and Hast not there with thee zadok
[1:12:28] and abiatar the priests therefore it
[1:12:30] shall be that what thing whatsoever Thou
[1:12:32] shalt hear out of the King's house Thou
[1:12:34] shalt tell it to zadak and to abather
[1:12:37] the priests behold they have there with
[1:12:39] them their two sons ah Zak's son and
[1:12:42] Jonathan abiatar son and by them you
[1:12:44] shall s unto me everything that she can
[1:12:47] hear so hushai David's friend came into
[1:12:52] the City and absolum came into Jerusalem
[1:12:55] now hopel hushai these are people we've
[1:12:58] not read about earlier in the scripture
[1:13:00] and won't read about again in the
[1:13:01] scripture they're just very relevant to
[1:13:03] this particular
[1:13:06] story so as David is cresting the hill
[1:13:10] of the
[1:13:11] mount a fellow named Zeba meets him Zeba
[1:13:14] was the chief of the Servants of
[1:13:17] mephibosheth Jonathan's son whom David
[1:13:20] had seated at the king's table treating
[1:13:21] him as a son because of his friendship
[1:13:24] with Jonathan Zeba has with him a couple
[1:13:27] of Saddle donkeys and various foods and
[1:13:29] for David and the people there and
[1:13:31] they're talking a little bit David's
[1:13:33] asking what's this all about and zeas
[1:13:35] says by the way mobos remains in
[1:13:38] Jerusalem expecting God to restore the
[1:13:40] kingship of Saul to
[1:13:43] him then said the king to Zeba behold
[1:13:48] thine are all that pertained under
[1:13:50] mobosi in other words David gives all of
[1:13:53] sa's apprpriate inheritance to Zeba
[1:13:55] taking it from MTH based on zeba's
[1:13:59] statements and Zeba said I humbly
[1:14:01] beseech thee that I may find Grace in
[1:14:04] thy sight oh Lord
[1:14:07] King well not all is well
[1:14:12] here chapter 16 verse5 when King David
[1:14:15] came to bahim that's about two miles
[1:14:18] Northeast of Jerusalem on the road to
[1:14:19] gilgal in Jericho is within the modern
[1:14:24] city borders behold there came then out
[1:14:27] of a man of the family of the House of
[1:14:29] Saul thus a benjaminite whose name was
[1:14:32] shami the son of Gara he came
[1:14:35] forth and cursed still as he came he
[1:14:38] cast stones at David and at all the
[1:14:41] Servants of King David all the people
[1:14:44] the mighty man that on his right hand
[1:14:45] and on his left he's throwing rocks at
[1:14:47] these
[1:14:48] guys thus said shimi when he cursed come
[1:14:51] out come out thou bloody man thou man of
[1:14:54] bile the Lord hath returned upon thee
[1:14:56] all the blood of the House of Saul in
[1:14:58] whose stead thou Hast reigned and the
[1:15:01] Lord ha delivered the kingdom into the
[1:15:02] hand of Absalon thy son behold Thou Art
[1:15:05] taken in thy Mischief because thou art a
[1:15:08] bloody
[1:15:10] man David's men want to kill Shen yeah
[1:15:14] but David said to let them be he said my
[1:15:17] own son wants to kill me how much danger
[1:15:20] can this guy do God told him to curse me
[1:15:23] perhaps the Lord will see my suffering
[1:15:26] today and reward me good for this
[1:15:30] cursing so they passed by Shi cursing
[1:15:33] and throwing stones and dust at them the
[1:15:35] whole
[1:15:37] time absum enters Jerusalem and the
[1:15:41] counselor hit theel accompanies him
[1:15:44] hushai comes to absum and convinces
[1:15:46] absum that he wants to serve him just as
[1:15:49] he served
[1:15:52] David accepting
[1:15:54] this absum asks counsel of ayapel who
[1:15:58] tells him to have relations with Dave's
[1:16:01] concubines to show that he abor his
[1:16:05] father David and that doing this will
[1:16:06] strengthen his hand among his
[1:16:09] followers Absalom SS up a tent on the
[1:16:12] top of the
[1:16:14] palace and does just that in the sight
[1:16:16] of all
[1:16:17] Israel more of Nathan's prophecy
[1:16:22] fulfilled
[1:16:24] and we read that the councel of ayapel
[1:16:27] which he counseled in those days was as
[1:16:30] if a man had inquired at the Oracle of
[1:16:32] God as if they'd gone to the Tabernacle
[1:16:34] before the um and Thum and so was all
[1:16:37] the Council of a hopel both with David
[1:16:40] and with
[1:16:41] absum this guy had influence he was
[1:16:44] trusted he had a track
[1:16:49] record ayapel advised absum to
[1:16:52] immediately
[1:16:53] dispatched 12,000 troops to catch David
[1:16:56] while he's on the run and kill
[1:16:58] him absum turns to hushi and asked is
[1:17:02] this a good idea is that we should do
[1:17:04] hisai says not so fast not so fast
[1:17:08] gather from all the people from Dan to
[1:17:11] Bersa then go after David with a huge
[1:17:15] army with absolum personally leading
[1:17:19] them David won't stand a chance against
[1:17:22] such an attack
[1:17:27] absolum agrees with hushi hushi then
[1:17:29] gets word to zadex and abith our sons
[1:17:32] who go and tell David David and his
[1:17:34] followers leave that night and cross the
[1:17:39] Jordan a hopel sees his counsel is not
[1:17:43] followed he goes home and he hangs
[1:17:47] himself here I think we see another
[1:17:51] somewhat strange foreshadow of the
[1:17:55] Messiah how in a parallel of
[1:17:58] Judas Judas was a disciple he was a
[1:18:01] trusted confident of Jesus he was the
[1:18:06] treasurer and it has David ascends them
[1:18:09] out of all as he receives word of ael's
[1:18:12] treachery just as Jesus was confronted
[1:18:14] in Gethsemane by the Enemy by Judas
[1:18:18] Treasury and like Judas when his plot
[1:18:21] doesn't go the way he thought it wood he
[1:18:24] hangs himself cursed be he that hangs
[1:18:28] from a
[1:18:30] tree as absolum gathers his army David
[1:18:34] comes to
[1:18:35] mahaim that's the same place you read
[1:18:37] about last week where ishbosheth ruled
[1:18:40] for two years over Israel in the throws
[1:18:42] of the Civil War for power after Saul's
[1:18:44] death absum places amasa as fellow named
[1:18:49] amasa is the commander of the army joab
[1:18:51] had remained with David
[1:18:53] he crosses Jordan and
[1:18:55] so Israel and Absalom pitched in the
[1:18:59] land of
[1:19:00] Gilead and it came to pass when David
[1:19:03] was come to mahanaim that shi the son of
[1:19:06] nahash of rabba of the children of
[1:19:08] Aman remember about the children of
[1:19:11] Aman God's anger at Aman and Moab for
[1:19:15] not providing food and water to Moses
[1:19:17] and the Israelites on their way to
[1:19:19] Canaan we talked about that when we
[1:19:21] studied the Book of Ruth
[1:19:23] did anyone from Ammon learn from that
[1:19:27] well let's see and maker the son of emel
[1:19:30] of Lo the bell and Bartel the gileadite
[1:19:32] of
[1:19:34] ralim they brought beds that's sleeping
[1:19:36] mats and basins Earth and vessels clay
[1:19:39] pots wheat barley flour parched corn
[1:19:42] that means roasted grain beans lentils
[1:19:45] and parched pulse pulses seeds of peas
[1:19:48] and beans so these are roasted seeds of
[1:19:51] peas and beans and honey and butter and
[1:19:53] sheep and cheese of cow's milk for David
[1:19:56] and for the people that were with him to
[1:19:57] eat for they said the people is hungry
[1:19:59] and weary and thirsty in the
[1:20:02] wilderness they did exactly what their
[1:20:04] forefathers should have
[1:20:08] done David organizes his army he divides
[1:20:11] it into three brigades he wants to lead
[1:20:14] them but the people say David no you
[1:20:17] stay here you're the reason we're doing
[1:20:19] this if something happens to you we lose
[1:20:21] everything you stay
[1:20:24] here okay David bows to their
[1:20:28] wishes but the King David commanded joab
[1:20:33] and abashi and IAI the three Brigade
[1:20:35] commanders saying deal gently for for my
[1:20:39] sake with the young man even with
[1:20:43] Absalom this is David the father's
[1:20:46] feeling for his son and all the people
[1:20:49] heard when the king gave all the
[1:20:51] captains charge
[1:20:53] concerning absum the people were looking
[1:20:56] to David as the king whereas he was
[1:20:59] looking at absum as his son the son of
[1:21:02] his father well the battle takes place
[1:21:05] in a forest absum is riding on a mule
[1:21:09] and apparently it was not just after a
[1:21:12] haircut because as it passes under an
[1:21:15] oak tree his hair gets Tangled in the
[1:21:17] bow and he comes off the mule dangling
[1:21:20] from his
[1:21:21] hair joab hears of this finds
[1:21:25] absum and he that's joab took three
[1:21:28] darts in his hand and thrust him through
[1:21:29] the heart of absolum while he was yet
[1:21:31] alive in the midst of the Oak and 10
[1:21:34] young men that be joab's armor compassed
[1:21:36] about circled him and smote absum and
[1:21:39] killed
[1:21:41] him and joab blew the trumpet and the
[1:21:44] people returned from pursuing after
[1:21:46] Israel for joab held back the people he
[1:21:49] stopped the pursuit and further Carnage
[1:21:54] turns out that there were
[1:21:56] 20,000 people of Israel that were killed
[1:21:58] in that battle and they took absum and
[1:22:01] cast him into a great pit in the wood
[1:22:03] and laid a very great heap of stones
[1:22:05] upon him and all Israel fled everyone to
[1:22:09] his
[1:22:11] tent now absam in his lifetime had taken
[1:22:14] and reared up for
[1:22:16] himself his Facebook page a pillar which
[1:22:21] is in the king's Dale the pin valley in
[1:22:23] Jerusalem for he said I have no Sons to
[1:22:26] keep my name in remembrance and he
[1:22:28] called the pillar after his own name and
[1:22:30] it is called unto this day absalom's
[1:22:32] place this this photo is of an ancient
[1:22:34] tomb traditionally assigned as absalom's
[1:22:37] Monument brother Daniel spoke about this
[1:22:40] a few weeks
[1:22:41] ago so ABS must have done this when he
[1:22:44] was young because he read earlier this
[1:22:45] evening that he had three sons as well
[1:22:48] as a daughter named
[1:22:50] Tamar well a runner arrives and tells
[1:22:54] David absum has been
[1:22:59] killed and the King was much moved and
[1:23:02] went up to the chamber over the gate and
[1:23:05] wept and as he went thus he said oh my
[1:23:09] son absolum my son my son
[1:23:13] absolum would God I had died for the
[1:23:17] absum my son my
[1:23:21] son
[1:23:23] sometimes it takes a friend willing to
[1:23:26] risk that friendship to help us see how
[1:23:29] our self- Focus can have unintended
[1:23:32] consequences on others in this case joab
[1:23:35] is that friend joab is a complex and
[1:23:38] somewhat mysterious person he's with
[1:23:40] David from the beginning back when he
[1:23:42] was hiding in a cave from Saul I think
[1:23:44] he was the second name listed of the
[1:23:46] people that were hiding with David he
[1:23:48] arranged a way to get David's attention
[1:23:50] to bring absolum back to Jerusalem when
[1:23:52] he you saw that David wanted him
[1:23:54] back but he's also the one who assured
[1:23:57] absum was killed when David had
[1:24:00] specifically asked that he be
[1:24:03] spared he did this ending the contest
[1:24:06] for the throne to which Samuel had
[1:24:09] anointed
[1:24:12] David and it was told joab behold the
[1:24:15] king weeps and Mourns for
[1:24:19] Absalom and the victory that day
[1:24:23] was turned into mourning unto all the
[1:24:25] people for the people heard say that day
[1:24:28] how the King was grieved for his
[1:24:32] son and the people get them by stealth
[1:24:35] they tiptoed quietly that day into the
[1:24:37] city as as people being ashamed steal
[1:24:40] away when they flee in
[1:24:43] battle but the king covered his face and
[1:24:46] the King cried with a loud voice oh my
[1:24:49] son absolum absolum my son my
[1:24:56] son and joab boldly came into the house
[1:25:00] to the king and said thou Hast shamed
[1:25:03] this day the faces of all thy servants
[1:25:08] which this day have saved thy life and
[1:25:12] the lives of thy sons and of thy
[1:25:16] daughters and the lives of thy wives and
[1:25:20] the lives of thy concubines and that
[1:25:22] thou lovest thine enemies and hatest thy
[1:25:26] friends David wake up for by your
[1:25:30] behavior thou Hast declared this day
[1:25:33] that thou regardest neither
[1:25:36] princes your family nor servants for
[1:25:41] this day I perceive that if abselet
[1:25:44] lived and we all had died this day then
[1:25:49] it had pleased thee
[1:25:51] well
[1:25:53] now therefore arise get up David go
[1:25:58] forth and speak comfortably un thy
[1:26:00] servants reassure your people for I
[1:26:03] swear by the Lord if thou go not forth
[1:26:06] there will not t one with thee this
[1:26:09] night and it will be worse unto thee
[1:26:12] than all the evil that befell thee from
[1:26:15] thy youth until now David get a
[1:26:21] grip
[1:26:25] so David heads South he comes to the
[1:26:29] Jordan River the the men of Judah meet
[1:26:31] him near
[1:26:34] gilgal and shm the man who cursed David
[1:26:38] comes with a thousand
[1:26:41] benjaminites and begs forgiveness and
[1:26:46] shimi said to the
[1:26:49] king let not my Lord impute iniquity un
[1:26:52] to me neither do thou remember that
[1:26:54] which thy servant did perversely the day
[1:26:56] that my Lord the king went out of
[1:26:58] Jerusalem that the king should take it
[1:27:00] to his heart for thy servant does know
[1:27:02] that I I have sinned therefore behold I
[1:27:07] am come the first this day of all the
[1:27:09] house of Joseph to go down to meet my
[1:27:12] Lord the
[1:27:14] King David's men want to kill
[1:27:17] shimi David spares him perhaps thinking
[1:27:20] back on his sin with ba Sheba that the
[1:27:22] Lord forgave him when he repented and in
[1:27:25] this whole context he wrote in Psalm 32
[1:27:28] which we read in our opening blessed is
[1:27:30] he whose transgression is Forgiven whose
[1:27:34] sin is covered blessed is the man unto
[1:27:38] whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity and
[1:27:41] whose Spirit there is no guile let not
[1:27:45] my Lord impute iniquity unto me said
[1:27:48] ji I acknowledge my sin unto thee and
[1:27:51] mine iniquity have I not hid I said I
[1:27:53] will confess my transgressions unto the
[1:27:55] Lord and thou forgest the iniquity of my
[1:27:59] sin we're told if we want forgiveness we
[1:28:03] must
[1:28:04] forgive you recall as David was fleeing
[1:28:08] from Jerusalem Zeba came and told him
[1:28:10] that mbth was happy absum toose David
[1:28:13] and MTH expected to become
[1:28:16] king mbth now meets David as he enters
[1:28:21] Jerusalem
[1:28:22] and mbth the son of Saul came down to
[1:28:25] meet the king and had neither dressed
[1:28:27] his feet nor trimmed his beard nor
[1:28:30] washed his clothes from the day that the
[1:28:33] king departed until the day that he came
[1:28:35] again in
[1:28:37] peace it's not the actions of a man
[1:28:40] who's expected to be crowned
[1:28:42] King it came to pass when he was come to
[1:28:45] Jerusalem to meet the king that the king
[1:28:47] said to
[1:28:48] him why didn't you come with me mbth
[1:28:53] and he
[1:28:55] answered my Lord oh King my servant Zeba
[1:29:00] deceive me for I said I will saddle me
[1:29:05] and ass that I may ride thereon and go
[1:29:07] to the king because I'm
[1:29:10] lame and Zeba hath slandered me unto my
[1:29:14] Lord the king but my Lord the king is an
[1:29:17] angel from God therefore do what is good
[1:29:20] in thine eyes
[1:29:24] David continues to show kindness and
[1:29:27] victory but the grumblings of future
[1:29:29] problems are present and the men of
[1:29:31] Israel and Judah exchange
[1:29:34] barbs chapter 20 tells of another
[1:29:37] immediately following
[1:29:39] Rebellion by Israel led by a man named
[1:29:42] Sheba also the son of Benjamin remember
[1:29:46] Benjamin was Saul's tribe and they are
[1:29:48] all smarting over losing the kingship
[1:29:51] under Saul Saul but this Rebellion is
[1:29:54] also
[1:29:56] suppressed we find that when Saul was
[1:29:59] King he sought to kill the giban ites
[1:30:01] the Lord sends a famine on Israel and
[1:30:03] after three years the Lord tells David
[1:30:06] that it's because of Saul's actions to
[1:30:09] the gibit David asked the gibeonites
[1:30:11] what he can do to make them happy and
[1:30:13] stop the famine and I'll let you read
[1:30:17] what happened and your devotions and
[1:30:19] Bible reading at home I'm not going to
[1:30:21] SPO it for
[1:30:23] you sometime later David and his army go
[1:30:26] to war David is exhausted and nearly
[1:30:29] killed after this he is persuaded to not
[1:30:32] go to war it's too personally risky for
[1:30:35] him David's getting
[1:30:38] old chapter 22 is a song it's very like
[1:30:42] Psalm 18 Again you should read that and
[1:30:45] rejoice in it it's it's
[1:30:47] beautiful chapter
[1:30:49] 23 records David's life last words
[1:30:53] that's followed by a list of David's
[1:30:55] Warriors some 37 names including Uriah
[1:30:58] the hittite beba's
[1:31:00] husband included in this is a flashback
[1:31:03] to an incident in the time David was
[1:31:06] hiding in a cave Saul was King the
[1:31:08] Philistines Garrison had control of
[1:31:10] Bethlehem and David's no I'm not going
[1:31:13] to spoil that for you you need to read
[1:31:15] that
[1:31:18] too understand that things that are
[1:31:21] written in the Bible are not necessarily
[1:31:23] chronological they're written to make a
[1:31:25] point they can Flash Forward flash back
[1:31:28] so we just had David's final words but
[1:31:31] now we're flashing back we're going to
[1:31:33] an earlier
[1:31:35] time we don't know when in David's Reign
[1:31:38] that this event happened I I think it's
[1:31:41] likely to have occurred shortly after
[1:31:43] David became king over all Israel in
[1:31:45] Jerusalem and wanted to know the extent
[1:31:47] of his kingdom what what am I really
[1:31:49] controlling here
[1:31:52] 2 Samuel chapter 24 the Final Chapter
[1:31:55] again the anger of the Lord was kindled
[1:31:58] against
[1:31:59] Israel and he who the Lord moved David
[1:32:05] against them to
[1:32:07] say go number Israel in Judah for the
[1:32:11] king said to joab the captain of the
[1:32:13] host which was with him go now through
[1:32:16] all the tribes of Israel from Dan even
[1:32:18] to Bersa and number ye the people that I
[1:32:21] may know
[1:32:22] that I may know the number of the
[1:32:26] people joab said unto the king now the
[1:32:29] Lord thy God add unto the people ever
[1:32:31] how many they may be a h hundredfold
[1:32:33] that the Eyes of My Lord the king may
[1:32:35] see it but why does my Lord the king
[1:32:37] Delight in this
[1:32:39] thing notwithstanding the king's word
[1:32:42] prevailed against joab against the
[1:32:44] captains of the host and joab and the
[1:32:46] captains of the host went out from the
[1:32:48] presence of the king to number the
[1:32:49] people of Israel
[1:32:52] but there's a parallel account of this
[1:32:55] found in 1 Chronicles chapter 21 it says
[1:33:00] and Satan stood up against Israel and
[1:33:04] provoked David to number
[1:33:06] Israel like the Book of Job the Lord
[1:33:09] allows Satan to do something and David
[1:33:13] said to joab and to the rulers of the
[1:33:15] people go number Israel from Beva even
[1:33:17] to Dan and bring the number of them to
[1:33:19] me that I may know it
[1:33:22] as in 2 Samuel joab resists but complies
[1:33:26] but we get another detail here Levi and
[1:33:28] Benjamin counted he not among them for
[1:33:31] the king's word was abominable to
[1:33:33] joab and God was displeased with this
[1:33:37] thing therefore he smote
[1:33:41] Israel
[1:33:44] why we'll see why in a moment back to 2
[1:33:47] Samuel verse 10 David's heart smote him
[1:33:50] after that he had numbered the people
[1:33:53] David said unto the Lord I have sinned
[1:33:56] greatly and that I have done and now I
[1:33:58] beseech thee Oh Lord take away the
[1:34:00] iniquity of thy servant for I have done
[1:34:03] very
[1:34:04] foolishly again we see David's
[1:34:07] heart he's saying Lord this is on me I
[1:34:12] have sinned forgive
[1:34:15] me for when David was up earlier in the
[1:34:19] morning the word of the Lord came unto
[1:34:20] the prophet G David's Seer saying go and
[1:34:24] say unto David thus sayeth the Lord I
[1:34:26] offer thee three things choose thee one
[1:34:29] of them that I may do it unto
[1:34:31] thee so Gad came to David and told him
[1:34:34] and
[1:34:35] said shall seven years of famine come
[1:34:37] unto thee in thy
[1:34:39] land or wil thou flee three months from
[1:34:42] before thine enemies while they pursue
[1:34:45] thee or that there be three days
[1:34:47] pestilence in thy land advise see what
[1:34:51] answer I shall return to him that sent
[1:34:54] me and David said unto God I am in a
[1:34:58] great Strait let us fall now into the
[1:35:01] hand of the Lord for his mercies are
[1:35:03] great let me not fall into the hand of
[1:35:08] man so the Lord sent a pestilence upon
[1:35:12] Israel from the morning even to the time
[1:35:15] appointed and there died of the people
[1:35:18] from Dan even to Beva 70
[1:35:22] thousand
[1:35:25] men why a
[1:35:28] pestilence why a plague on the
[1:35:31] people the short answer is that's what
[1:35:34] the law
[1:35:37] required what remember Deuteronomy the
[1:35:41] commands to the king to write that book
[1:35:43] and read in that book every day
[1:35:44] understand
[1:35:45] it David says in the Psalms Thy word
[1:35:49] have I placed in my heart that I might
[1:35:50] not sin against against thee well
[1:35:53] there's a law regarding taking a census
[1:35:57] Exodus 30 we read the Lord spake unto
[1:35:59] Moses saying when thou takest the sum of
[1:36:02] the children of Israel after their
[1:36:04] number then shall they give Every Man a
[1:36:07] ransom for his soul unto the Lord when
[1:36:10] thou nbest
[1:36:12] them but what if they don't that there
[1:36:14] be no plague among them when thouest
[1:36:20] them so the Lord then gives directions
[1:36:22] as to the amount to be collected it to
[1:36:24] be used to support the Tabernacle not
[1:36:26] Tucson Tabernacle but that Tabernacle
[1:36:29] David didn't perform a census to support
[1:36:31] the Tabernacle he took it for his
[1:36:32] personal gratification that I may know
[1:36:36] there's no indication in second Samuel
[1:36:38] or first Chronicles that a census tax
[1:36:39] was collected and provided for the
[1:36:41] Tabernacle thus a plague
[1:36:46] occurred back to 2 Samuel in 1
[1:36:50] Chronicles
[1:36:52] and when the angel stretched out his
[1:36:54] hand upon Jerusalem it's the end of this
[1:36:56] plague he's come to Jerusalem stretched
[1:36:58] out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy
[1:37:00] it the Lord repented him of the evil and
[1:37:04] said to the angel that destroyed the
[1:37:06] people it is enough stay now thine
[1:37:10] hand and the angel of the Lord was by
[1:37:13] the threshing place of Arona is also
[1:37:17] called Oran the jebusite in Chronicles
[1:37:20] it says
[1:37:22] David lifted up his eyes and saw the
[1:37:25] angel of the Lord hovering standing
[1:37:27] between the Earth and Heaven having a
[1:37:29] drawn sword in his hand stretched out
[1:37:31] over
[1:37:32] Jerusalem then David and the Elders of
[1:37:35] Israel who were clothed in sacko not
[1:37:38] kingly Priestly robes fell on their
[1:37:45] faces back to Samuel David spake unto
[1:37:48] the Lord when he saw the angel that
[1:37:50] smokee the people people and said whoo I
[1:37:54] have sinned I have done wickedly but
[1:37:57] these sheep what have they done let
[1:38:01] thine hand I pray the be against me and
[1:38:03] against my father's
[1:38:05] house remember David was a shepherd He
[1:38:10] has the heart of a
[1:38:14] shepherd and God came that day to David
[1:38:16] and said unto him go up rear an altar
[1:38:20] unto the the Lord in the threshing floor
[1:38:22] of AR the
[1:38:25] jebusite meanwhile in Chronicles and
[1:38:29] Oran that's ARA turned back and saw the
[1:38:34] angel and His Four Sons with him hid
[1:38:36] themselves I imagine pretty quickly now
[1:38:40] ornin was threshing wheat and as David
[1:38:43] came to ornin ornin looked and saw David
[1:38:47] and went out of the threshing floor
[1:38:49] where he was hiding and bowed himself to
[1:38:51] to David with his face to the ground
[1:38:54] then David said to ornin grant me the
[1:38:56] place of this threshing floor that I may
[1:38:58] build an alter therein unto the Lord
[1:39:00] Thou shalt Grant it me for the full
[1:39:02] price that the plague may be stayed from
[1:39:05] all the
[1:39:07] people and ornin said to
[1:39:13] David take it to the and let my Lord the
[1:39:16] king do that which is good in his eyes I
[1:39:18] I I give the the oxin also for burnt
[1:39:20] offerings and the threshing instruments
[1:39:22] for wood and wheat for the meat offering
[1:39:23] I give it
[1:39:26] all the king said to AR nay but I will
[1:39:30] surely buy it of thee at a price neither
[1:39:34] will I offer burnt offerings unto the
[1:39:36] Lord my God of that which doth cost me
[1:39:40] nothing so David bought the threshing
[1:39:42] for and The Oxen for 50 shekels of
[1:39:47] silver the final verse of second Samuel
[1:39:50] David built there altar unto the Lord
[1:39:52] and offered burnt offerings and peace
[1:39:55] offerings so the Lord was intreated for
[1:39:57] the land and the plague was stayed from
[1:40:01] Israel but between those two
[1:40:05] sentences there are things going on
[1:40:07] which are recorded in first
[1:40:10] Chronicles we read David built an altar
[1:40:13] unto the Lord and offered burnt
[1:40:14] offerings and peace
[1:40:16] offerings and called upon the Lord and
[1:40:20] the Lord answered from Heaven by fire
[1:40:24] upon the altar of the burnt
[1:40:28] offering and the Lord commanded the
[1:40:30] still plainly visible angel with his
[1:40:32] sword drawn that he put up his sword
[1:40:34] again into the sheath
[1:40:38] thereof at that time when David saw that
[1:40:42] the Lord had answered him in the
[1:40:43] threshing floor of orn the jebusite when
[1:40:46] he saw the angel sheath his sword then
[1:40:49] he sacrificed there
[1:40:54] this latter portion of 2 Samuel details
[1:40:56] the problems that befell the nation
[1:40:58] through failed leadership not simply of
[1:41:01] David but a continuation from the days
[1:41:03] of the judges through Saul to David
[1:41:06] we'll see more of this as we progress
[1:41:08] through the books of kings and
[1:41:10] Chronicles the Lord wanted Jacob's
[1:41:12] descendants to follow him to be examples
[1:41:16] to the rest of the
[1:41:17] world but instead of being the
[1:41:19] influencers they became the
[1:41:22] influenced worship of the Lord became a
[1:41:25] a religion imperfectly followed rather
[1:41:29] than a relationship passionately
[1:41:32] pursued God's correction is often harsh
[1:41:36] he allows problems and tragedies to come
[1:41:39] our
[1:41:42] way these are not for him to discover
[1:41:45] our weaknesses they are for us to
[1:41:48] understand them to overcome and to grow
[1:41:52] David's sins were forgiven but the
[1:41:54] consequences of those sins were still to
[1:41:56] be
[1:41:57] born sadly many times others suffer as a
[1:42:02] result of our failures we need to be
[1:42:05] aware that our actions as well as our
[1:42:09] inactions have
[1:42:11] consequences in our lives we need to
[1:42:15] like the kings of old keep the word in
[1:42:17] our hearts read from the book every day
[1:42:22] and read with understanding if the
[1:42:25] musicians would please come the
[1:42:28] Commandments to Kings we read last week
[1:42:29] are good
[1:42:31] rules for us to follow regardless of our
[1:42:34] position or calling
[1:42:36] yesterday Heather and I celebrated our
[1:42:38] 53rd wedding
[1:42:40] anniversary when we were courting I
[1:42:43] didn't just sit down and wait for her to
[1:42:44] drop in my lap I pursued
[1:42:47] her sadly once we were married I thought
[1:42:51] I had achieved what I sought not so it's
[1:42:54] taken me many many years to realize what
[1:42:57] a gem she is someone not to be taken for
[1:43:01] granted as a result in recent years our
[1:43:04] love has grown to new heights and its
[1:43:06] roots have reached new
[1:43:08] depths I don't take her presence her
[1:43:11] love for granted nor she mine we're a
[1:43:15] team in this together for the Long Haul
[1:43:20] and neither should we any of us take the
[1:43:22] Lord's Grace his love his presence for
[1:43:26] granted we're in this together with him
[1:43:31] for the long
[1:43:32] hul as we close this portion of the
[1:43:36] service let's sing I could never out

[1:44:29] giving and and
[1:44:32] loving brought
[1:44:35] pain and I
[1:44:37] promised that I'd
[1:44:39] never let it
[1:44:43] happen
[1:44:45] again but I found
[1:44:47] out that loveing
[1:44:51] is well
[1:44:52] worth the
[1:44:54] risk and that
[1:44:57] even in
[1:45:00] losing you
[1:45:04] win I'm going to
[1:45:07] live the

[1:45:59] nothing to
[1:46:01] give he
[1:46:04] loved when
[1:46:06] loving brought
[1:46:09] heartache and
[1:46:11] lost he
[1:46:14] forgave from the old
[1:46:17] ruged
[1:46:19] cross

[1:47:40] men very gifted
[1:47:43] men in husi and
[1:47:46] hiel men with callings upon their lives
[1:47:51] both of them gave the right
[1:47:55] counsel but one chose to follow the
[1:48:00] wrong
[1:48:01] person
[1:48:03] ayapel husi chose to follow and to be
[1:48:08] loyal to David both of them equally
[1:48:12] gifted and whoi won because he was able
[1:48:16] to deceive absum into making the wrong
[1:48:19] choice and
[1:48:21] ayapel saw as brother Lyall pointed
[1:48:26] out he
[1:48:29] saw that his time was over and he had
[1:48:32] betrayed the wrong person in the
[1:48:35] King the same as
[1:48:39] Judas and I I must admit that I always
[1:48:43] wondered brother Craig I always wondered
[1:48:45] about numbering the people and why was
[1:48:48] that such a sin for David when we see
[1:48:51] the people numbered many times in the
[1:48:54] scriptures and it shows how important it
[1:48:57] is for us that call ourselves ministers
[1:49:01] or
[1:49:03] pastors that we have a Ministry that we
[1:49:05] follow this word to the
[1:49:09] letter
[1:49:11] David in in numbering the people maybe
[1:49:13] he didn't do wrong but he did it in the
[1:49:15] wrong way and he left out as brother
[1:49:18] Lyall pointed out he left it out that
[1:49:20] tax on the
[1:49:21] people and therefore he got out of God's
[1:49:25] will shows us how important it is that
[1:49:29] we don't take this word for granted that
[1:49:32] we we hold it with as much reverence as
[1:49:36] we can and we we pray about it before we
[1:49:39] bring it to the people because if we
[1:49:42] bring something wrong look at look at
[1:49:45] the consequences of doing something
[1:49:49] wrong and we see with with David and how
[1:49:53] the people suffered because of numbering
[1:49:57] the people and we see the the
[1:50:01] advice of
[1:50:04] ayapel and he made the wrong choice and
[1:50:08] the man he chose a man that didn't have
[1:50:12] character and hushi chose the man that
[1:50:15] was after God's Own Heart even though
[1:50:17] all the mistakes that he made he was
[1:50:20] a great
[1:50:21] king and I love these first and 2 Samuel
[1:50:26] because it shows the humanity of David
[1:50:29] shows that he was this great man that we
[1:50:30] all know he was but he was also a man
[1:50:34] that had many faults and made many
[1:50:36] mistakes and I love David for his
[1:50:40] mistakes because it shows me that that
[1:50:42] no matter what I do if my heart is right
[1:50:45] and Lord I'm trying you see that I got
[1:50:47] out of your will Lord forgive me the
[1:50:49] grace of God is there to forgive us
[1:50:52] brother brother Lyall thank you my
[1:50:54] brother brother Craig if you come up my
[1:50:56] brother and say a few words to the
[1:50:59] people brother Aon if we could sing that
[1:51:01] song
[1:51:03] [Music]
[1:51:05] again that's a good
[1:51:08] one my
[1:51:14] life
[1:51:16] Mercy
[1:51:18] r
[1:51:21] [Music]
[1:51:24] I I should have
[1:51:29] fall my
[1:51:31] soul cast
[1:51:33] down God's
[1:51:37] Mery
[1:51:39] rro my
[1:51:42] life it's good to be with you again I
[1:51:44] think it's been a couple years since
[1:51:45] we've been here and um pastoring up in
[1:51:49] Connecticut
[1:51:50] and um I'm here with my family my wife
[1:51:53] Anna and all my
[1:51:55] children uh my wife's uncle David
[1:51:59] Williams uh had passed away and so we
[1:52:02] come down for the
[1:52:04] funeral and uh to help with the funeral
[1:52:07] and I'm kind of dancing I've got a
[1:52:11] meeting in h Dallas so we're flying to
[1:52:15] Dallas tomorrow and then we'll be flying
[1:52:17] back next week for the uh for the
[1:52:19] funeral but we're happy to be with you
[1:52:21] appreciate the word of God I too I too
[1:52:25] love the scriptures showing as brother
[1:52:27] brandom said the Bible tells the truth
[1:52:30] amen and it tells both
[1:52:32] sides and there's a part of the
[1:52:35] scripture said the Lord said unto my
[1:52:37] Lord the Holy Spirit came upon David and
[1:52:40] the Bible said David in the spirit
[1:52:44] said and uh brother brandham said it was
[1:52:46] a great difference between David and
[1:52:49] David in the spirit Spirit there's a
[1:52:51] great difference between the church and
[1:52:52] the church in the spirit but when David
[1:52:55] was in the spirit the Holy Spirit would
[1:52:57] come upon him and literally act out
[1:53:02] Jesus Christ 800 years later going up
[1:53:05] the Mount of Olives David in the spirit
[1:53:09] manifesting
[1:53:11] Christ
[1:53:12] then David typing
[1:53:15] Christ in the
[1:53:17] Millennium how many believe we at the
[1:53:19] coming of the Lord
[1:53:21] Jesus Israel's like just a boiling
[1:53:24] cauldron the world is in
[1:53:27] fragments we've been waiting for a long
[1:53:30] time but he shall come and there was a
[1:53:33] bunch of Gentiles that believed him and
[1:53:36] they just rallied around him and they
[1:53:38] drew their swords and began driving back
[1:53:40] the
[1:53:42] enemy and we realized that that was a
[1:53:45] spirit speaking of a gentile people that
[1:53:49] would see the anointed word of this day
[1:53:51] would draw our swords and while the
[1:53:54] World Turns it away turns Christ outside
[1:53:56] the church the word of God the Living
[1:53:59] Word of God that we would draw our
[1:54:01] swords and we would come against the
[1:54:04] enemy pushing back the powers of
[1:54:06] Darkness declaring Jesus Christ is the
[1:54:08] same yesterday today and
[1:54:11] forever just happy to be a part of that
[1:54:14] too God help us to be a people in the
[1:54:18] spirit and we just appreciate the word
[1:54:21] of God we appreciate you standing
[1:54:24] appreciate brother Daniel uh We've Come
