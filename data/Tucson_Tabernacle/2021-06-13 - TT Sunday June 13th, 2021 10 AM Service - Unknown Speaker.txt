your word be born in the manger of my heart it's christ in you the hope of glory letting him be manifested and growing you amen heal me o lord and i will be healed let's read a scripture in from philippians chapter 4 6 7 and 8. this morning i had several requests texts to me and uh asking for prayer and scripture of the day [Music] an app on the phone and one on the computer and open it up and it's it's good to read the word of god the next page you flip on the computer or the next we open may be some bad news but god's word is good news all the time philippians 4 verses 6 through 8. [Music] if they'll put that up there [Music] it says be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to god being careful for nothing be don't be worried don't be anxious don't don't don't get to the point where you're you're frozen you're stiff you can't you don't know how to go forward but he says you know give god praise give god thanks and the peace of god which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through to christ jesus then paul says this finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue any way to re receive strength from and if there be any praise think on these things and sometimes we we get to and and we're all the same we feel pain we feel hurts and and so it affects us but if we as quickly as we can we take god's word and say let's apply god's word to the situation so we have some requests to to bring to your attention and our sister tony just asking her prayer for her brother david he's an icu with a weak heart and fluid in his lungs spoke to brother rome as as we were he was coming in he's got a doctor's appointment too she's been having some pains and things and they're looking there and then spent some time with dad and mom yesterday and dad's going to go in for an mri of his back it's been doctors have not been able to find some of the causes the blood test and everything you've done recently have been perfect been fine no issues but there are some things going on so sister glide will ask us to remember her daughter sister rachel says special prayer requests so we know god is mindful that's her statement we know god over and over he's proved that to us and then brother robert figured i sent a text this morning about seven o'clock and he had asked prayer during this week sister dalia was going to be back in the hospital with the you know the diabetes they had done surgery on her legs and all and there were some complications so she was this week there and this morning she was in a lot of pain so he called the doctor and they asked her to take her back to the hospital so i believe there at tmc this morning and he requested prayer so i told him we would do that it has been uh if you hear brother branham quite often he said diabetes that ugly disease he called it not that there's a good disease but he just how he how he would identify it but he never said it's too great for god it's too much he said i am the lord god that healeth thee so and continue to remember brother daniel freijo in prayer uh sister karen had put a posted good news and then we read wednesday night doctors told him about six weeks of therapy and he would be able to walk again but i know a god i met him personally he's my god lord and savior and he said rise up and walk and right then and there took him by and then he shows that he's still the same yesterday yesterday today and forever because peter and john are walking over to the temple and peter turned around john says such as i have i give unto thee in the name of lord jesus christ rise up and walk so because he's still the same and then my wife received a text from sister grant most of you here have been wild sister litha grant she's been she requested prayer she's been diagnosed with cancer in the stomach she has to we can't began chemo soon and is trusting the lord her times and seasons are in his hands so the chemotherapy would they said would start this coming week i believe what she said to my wife and the doctor told her she's going to experience a lot of fatigue and things but they're still the doctor we talked to if you'll stand with me there there's a peace and a rest and a comfort beyond our understanding beyond our reasoning that god is more than able god has a reason and a time and a season for all things we rest in that saying lord i believe and sometimes we have to raise the other hand it says lord help my unbelief but god is mindful of us let's just pray lord we we've read these requests and you weren't listening and saying oh my i didn't know that i wasn't aware of that i'm glad they they mentioned it to me lord but you're aware of all things and it said you were slain from before the foundation of the world you were wounded you were bruised for us lord because you knew we would have need of healing of peace of comfort of strength of salvation everything that we would have needed you would meet lord you've heard these requests lord we would do anything we could to help them get through this time to ease their pain to to comfort them lord but we really trust in you lord in the words that we speak we're going to speak your word your promises lord for healing for strength for peace for comfort for direction whatever it needs is needed in each hand each heart each request lord we know it's in your hands lord and we thank you for it in jesus christ's name amen let's sing that chorus heal me o lord heal me [Music] and i will be you are the one just one more time oh lord and i will be save me and i will be saved [Music] for you are the ones i praised [Music] remember as a church a body of believers in this time as we seek the will of the lord take to my time in prayer trusting in god that what he has for us is best i know sometimes we get anxious we anticipate we want to go but waiting on the lord we shall re renew our strength trust that we have brother dennis mcgeary with us this morning and his wife is here with them and i i remind you god saw this day so god set it up so god had you in mind this morning so receive what the lord has for you as you draw the lord has placed something on brother dennis's heart maybe brother dennis said lord why this but it's what god has has placed in his heart so as he comes let's he'll be here also this evening with us so how many just know that god is mindful of you say lord what i have need if sometimes he comes out and says you know i need to deal with this about with you and lord that wasn't what i thought i needed but god knows best so i appreciate that i was brother peter was standing there with jonas and in the hallway and i said you know i had we had six daughters and when you got what you thought one train the next one came and the next one came and it took a little bit of time i said but you'll get past it it'll be all right and sometimes we say lord again you'll get you'll get through god is so good to us so amazing grace how sweet the sound it saved a wretch like me and it still keeps me in grace [Music] like me i once was lost i was let's praise him let's praise him [Music] praise praise god praise god praise god praise god [Music] god bless you this morning it's a real privilege to be in the house of the lord and to be with you this morning i wondered just before we read our scripture this morning if you'd like to just keep playing sister so enjoy the music and just want to commit this portion of the service into his hands we've worshipped him in song and [Music] heard a lovely special now we want to worship him in his word but before we turn to his word how could we approach it without asking for his help so let's just bow our heads lord jesus it's so wonderful to see your saints this morning lord to see some battle-scarred veterans lord [Music] to see mothers lord and if given their lives for to see young men to see lovely young girls lord all these precious hearts have come to hear from you lord [Music] father we could probably fellowship one with another gain some great insights and get help and encouragement from one another lord but many have a lot to bring to the table lord a lot to offer the family a lot of good counsel and we love that lord but what we came this morning for lord is for what you bring to the table lord [Music] we look for you lord maybe one would say to another is is so-and-so gonna be there lord if someone said well jesus is going to be there oh lord we'd look for what you'd have to say lord that's where we are this morning lord we look for what you'd have to say and we pray that you'd come now and take preeminence for we love you lord and we ask it in your name the name of the lord jesus christ [Music] amen god bless you this morning if you'd like to turn in your bibles if you have them we'd like to thank you musicians and i'd like to turn in uh saint john the second chapter and we'd like to read a few verses very familiar scripture when jesus came to the temple and he braided three cords and if we could in our mind eyes imagine that the people in their normal way of serving god and you know like they came to church all the time but one day something quite unexpected happened and jesus began to drive all of the sellers out of the temple like he owned the place and you know we think well jesus had a right to do that so in our mind's eye we but put yourself in their place they didn't know him from adam and they thought well who is this man what in the world is going on here and so the the jews said in verse 18 then answered the jews and said unto him what sign show us thou unto us seeing that thou doest these things and jesus answered and said unto them destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it up then said the jews 40 in six years was this temple in building and wilt thou rear it up in three days but he spake of the temple of his body when therefore he was risen from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them and they believed the scriptures and the word which jesus had said now when he was in jerusalem at the passover in the feast day many believed his name when they saw the miracles which he did but jesus did not commit himself unto them because he knew all men and needed not that any should testify of man for he knew what was in man may the lord bless his word you may be seated so the bible says that he knew what was in man and i think as believers and people that have read their bibles and gone to church for many years we have a revelation that god knows all things we know that he's omnipotent and we know that if he is god then he he has to know and he's not learning he's not gaining any knowledge but he knew and i had the opportunity to talk to two muslim men and very simple subject i said did god does god know who's going to heaven and they said well of course he does and i said well then when did he know that and when we started on that subject we had to go to predestination and so i think the omnipotence of god is something that turn it on okay excuse me thank you it's something that we know very well that god knows all things and even though it's hard for us to imagine the prophet of god said that he knows every gnat and how many times it would blink its eyes and how much tallow it would produce and in our mind that's it's very hard for us to wrap our minds around god being all-knowing and man in his uh feeble attempts to be like god he's building big warehouses so that uh some lady in brazil can keep the picture of her cat in storage and however many pixels that is but this is what man's doing if you think that now everybody in china also wants their photographs of their grandchildren their dog their art project that they made everybody wants to keep a remembrance of this and so man is trying to fulfill that and if you pay a few dollars a month you can have just about unlimited storage so so we can begin to kind of get a concept of it in modern times and this idea of god knowing as we have served the lord and been in church we we begin to understand that and brother brown said that if you were aware of the presence of the lord you wouldn't sin you know it it's it's if if we were more conscious of him but i think many times our consciousness is kind of a intellectual concept that we know that god knows all things and so we read the scripture this morning because in verse 25 it says and he needed not that any should testify of man for he knew what was in man and he knows what's in us and scofield in this scripture he made a reference to samuel how that when the prophet of samuel went to choose the next king when god rejected saul he went to his house and he said uh you know show me the family and they went through each one of the sons and god rejected all of the sons that looked like they would be a good candidate to be the next king of israel and the prophet said you look on the outward appearance of man but god looketh on the heart and so he saw in david a heart that loved [Music] god and that's the part of us that we think about most but if you'll bear with me this morning if we would think about jesus saying destroy this temple the next verse it says then the disciples knew that he spoke of the temple of his body the lord to help us this morning we'd like to speak about what is man and if you'd like to go with me you don't have to but in we're going to read something that paul quoted in hebrews and in hebrews chapter 2 he quoted this verse out of psalms and we're going to read the verses around it's psalms 8 and 3. when i consider the heavens and the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained what is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou visitest him for thou has made him a little lower than the angels and has crowned him with glory and honor thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands thou hast put all things under his feet all sheep and oxen yay and the beast of the field the fowls of the air and the fish of the sea and whatever passes through the paths of the seas oh lord our lord how excellent is thy name in all the earth so david was looking out at the universe he could look at the stars he could look out at the greatness of god's creation you know they they say they can see a a hundred light years of space maybe even more now but in light travels at 8 000 miles per second i think is close to being right so david looked out at how great god's creation was and he thought what is man looking at at how great your works are what is what is man that that that those thou are mindful of them or the son of man that that thou visitest him and why would he use that expression the son of man because you know there's another place in the scripture that says man that's born of a woman is uh a few days and full of trouble well well what man isn't born of woman well there was only one that was adam and uh uh we're gonna go there in just a minute so it's an expression that you know a son of man it's just a it's a it's a it's a man born into this world like every other man and and paul is saying you know what is he that thou art mindful of him and like you'd also read a little something in ecclesiastes where solomon was commenting on the estate of man and he said i said in my heart concerning the estate of the sons of man that god might manifest them and that they might see that they themselves are beast for that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth the beast this is ecclesiastics 3 and 18 for which for that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beast even one thing befalleth them as the one dieth so dieth the other yea they have all one breath so that man hath no preeminence over a beast for all his vanity all go unto one place all are of the dust and all turn to the dust again isn't that a striking thing and we don't think of ourselves as dust but the truth is that we are and we in the book of genesis when we consider what man is and how man came to be we find out that we're just so much of about six common elements some of the most common elements in all creation carbon and oxygen we're about 50 water and then we're you know five percent calcium and you know if you just see one of these dirt trucks driving down the road that truck's worth hundreds of times the value of what you are if we were to trade you in or get you back to your original elements and it's a very strange thing because we never think of ourselves like that we never think of ourselves as dust but it was recorded in god's word for some divine purpose of how man was created and in genesis 1 we'll just rehearse these things to you uh in genesis 1 and 26 god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish in the sea and over the fowls of the air and over the cattle and over the all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them well you say brother dennis no dust there well we're not talking about dust man here we're talking about spirit man this theophany man that was in god's image this was the form that god was in we know that god filled all space in eternity and he just began to take a form towards man and he he was in this light that they called the logos and it was god taking the form and brother brown called that the theophany of god and then he said that when he created man he created him in his image and and male and female created he them that was spirit man so that spirit man ruled over the brooded over the earth and brother branham talked about the spirit of god brooding over the earth before he commit commanded adam and eve and he brought forth life and he brought forth a little greater life and he kept bringing greater life by brooding over the earth and i thought wouldn't it be wonderful if the lord could brood over us this morning and because he's an evolutionist if he could brood over us and bring a little higher spiritual life to us brood over us this morning and bring us into a little higher form in this spirit man form that we've come to talk about at church we didn't come to talk about dust man but to get to where god wants us to be in this fellowship with him and to accept his thought that he's trying to express to us something he wants us to possess and we know that by the word of god we'll understand by a revelation of what reality really is we're going to overcome lies and and and falseness and false accu accusation the devil puts on you and and misguidings and we know in the bible that only those that had their names on the book of life before the foundation of the world only those will not be deceived and not take the mark of the beast and all the rest of them will be deceived and so what's going to keep us from committing ourselves to man remember how jesus said he said he's not going to commit himself to that he's not going to come into that arena of man's uh approval and man's acclamation and all what man thinks is great and what man thinks his vindication of his righteousness and a vindication that he did the right thing that he took the right job that he got the right degree that he did good and he got approval and he came into this social atmosphere whether it be the church the school wherever and to get man's approval and to say hey this makes me who i am this makes me right or just jesus wasn't going to go there because he had a divine purpose and he didn't need that and you don't need that because you have a divine purpose you have no less commission than john the baptist when the angel said to him to zacharias you're going to have a son in your old age and his name's going to be john and he's going to do this and he's going to this is going to be his life this is going to be his purpose this is going to be his ministry and all the friends and family came around when he was born and wanted to argue about what his name was and zachariah being muted he had to ask for a patent say his name is john already and god knew your name before anybody chose it he he knew all about you and the purpose that he brought you this far is that he wanted fellowship with you he just wanted it like it was at the garden when he came down and he in the cool of the evening he could talk to adam and eve and there was nothing between there was nothing to hinder there was nothing no insufficiencies ineptness oh god help us this morning to come into the fellowship that he wants with us and the way he's helping us to get there is by expressing his thoughts through his word and a lot of times somehow we're reading his word and let it go right over the top of us how do we know that happens because some years later we see the picture and we go oh my goodness now i hope today that you'll never use that expression my goodness off the cuff again without thinking what is my goodness now so here was spirit man but in verses 2 and 7 let's go a little bit above that verse 5 it said for the lord god had not caused it to rain on the earth and there was no and there was not a man to till the ground so he had this garden in eden but he had no gardener and there was no man to till the ground and the lord formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul in verse 1 and 24 speaking of animals and and god said let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping things and beast of the earth after his kind and it was so and god made the beast of the earth after his kind the cattle after their kind and everything that creepeth on the earth after its kind and god saw that it was good he made the animals out of the same materials that he made us and it's astounding that when you think of this and you can get so anointed with these thoughts i was preaching last sunday in in phoenix and and stopped at a rest stop and this little lizard came up on the post and having studied these things and kind of meditated on these things it's almost as if the the lizard came up real close to me and you know it was kind of like good morning little buddy and if the lizard could talk he'd say well you know i like your carbon i like the way the god did carbon and calcium and potash and cosmic light in you look at your outfit i say thank you you know thank you i like it too they said yeah well this is the suit that god put me in i'm i'm carbon too i'm calcium two i'm i'm i'm from the dirt too i'm made out of dust too daddy how do you like my suit because i'm just dirt like you are but look how god made you and look how god made me you're going to think the preacher's crazy this morning but but you know if you could really think of that that he is just what you are makes you feel closer to the animals you know a lot of you are maybe even too close to animals already but you know i mean as far as that affection thing i when i mean close i mean you know affectionate i'm working for a lady that is over the top so but uh you know we have this this this affinity with with with animals and and mankind sees that now he's never found the missing link and and and we'll touch on that briefly but let's go to to genesis 2 and 7. and we'll just we wanted to go a little further than two and seven and he breathed into them the breath of life now this man here which we're going to call dust man this is after the introduction of the shovel and and so you know we could we could see that man was in this state of being the dust of the earth and we see these things that were spoken in ecclesiastes and we and we see what this creation of man really is in reference to this tabernacle and so we have adam before the fall he's this dust man but he's in fellowship with god and adam had the title in the bible as son of god because we know in the genealogies when they went down through the genealogies coming down to jesus when it came to jesus it said who was born of mary it didn't say the son of who was the son of who was the son of it didn't say that concerning jesus when it came to jesus it said who was born of mary but when it went the other way backwards and it started you know somewhere in abraham and went kept going backwards and backwards and it said you know the the the son of enos which was the son of seth which was the son of adam which was the son of god now adam was in this dust man body in perfect fellowship with god and then god looked down at adam and saw that he was lonely gives us a little insight into god's feelings because the prophet said that god looked at adam and saw that he was as adam was like him that and he said it's not good for a man to dwell alone and he put adam to sleep and he took one of his ribs and he made the woman so that woman was not a new creation out of the dust of the earth but that woman was also dust of the earth because she came out of adam so here they were in the garden in this beautiful rest peace beautiful there's no evil there's no nervousness there's no tension there's no awkwardness there's no nothing like that there's only fellowship with god but then in the third chapter of genesis we find adam in another condition because now he's still dust man but now he's feeling guilty he's hiding from god he's afraid he said god said you know why did you hide he said well we were afraid because we we knew that we we were naked and he said well who who who who told you you were naked and so in genesis 3 god said because you've done this because they transgressed the word of god he said from now on you're going to have trouble on every hand and we could read those verses but you're all bible students you know the the earth is going to bear for thorns and he said how it was going to be for the woman he said how it was going to be from the man and he said because of this transgression this is how life's going to be now and then he also cursed the serpent and he said because you did this because you beguiled the woman this is from now on you're going to crawl on your belly and i'd like to read what schofield said about that scripture scofield said the serpent in his edenic form is not to be thought of as a writhing reptile eudenic form means you know in edom before the fall the serpent is not to be thought of as a writhing reptile scofield said this scofield predates brother branham what in the world people think man you're a cult you're you're you're off the deep end you're following some man because he says these these outrageous things okay let's choose another bible well-esteemed bible student and what is he saying he need not be thought of as a writhing reptile that is the effect of the curse the creature which is which lent itself to satan may well have been the most beautiful as it was the most subtle of the creatures less than man this is kind of common knowledge in the theological world we see man we see now he's in his fallen condition and nevertheless man attained to some great heights even in his fallen condition if we think about job job also had the same thought as david did and in job 17 and 17 he makes a very similar statement and we'll just read it this morning now job is suffering and why is he suffering because god bragged on him god said to satan he said have you considered job have you have you looked it at what what kind of a man he is and so all of these things befell job and he began to he said in verse 15 so that my soul he in the suffering he suffered so much that is that my soul would choosethe strangling and death rather than my life i loathe it i would not live all way let me alone for my days our vanity and he said what is man that thou should magnify him and that thou should have set thine heart upon him and that thou should just visit him every morning and try him every moment so job is wanting to hide from god and he's he's kind of reminding god what is man and this is a good man this is man that is at his good state and and he's pleading with god and he's saying you know what am i what is man that thou should us magnify him why am i in the spotlight have you ever felt like this you ever thought you know you you come under such con constrainment and such frustration in your life and such a challenge in your thinking and in your heart and in your human condition and now you have god to deal with and you try in prayer and soul-searching to to reconcile things with god and to understand and then you feel like man if i could just disappear you know if i could just go somewhere and david said well where could i go and god would not be there and i've always envisioned in my life you know i i i just fly away to uruguay i go down on the beach and with whatever cash i could have mustered to get out of town i got my little shack there by the beach and just everybody leave me alone and and let the rest of the world go by and then some little hispanic guy that knows english you know he's walking on the beach and he sees me there and he says you know do you know the lord i think do i know the lord do i know the lord so job he he he answered his his counselors his his religious friends that wanted to fellowship with them and kind of solve the problem and he said if i be wicked why then labor i in vain you know if i'm so out of sorts if i'm so away from god if if i'm so messed up then what is it in me that drives me and pushes me for more of god for more truth for for more of his spirit for more of the love of god what is this thirst in me because you come into this courtroom with the enemy the devil that he's an accuser of the brethren 24 7. the the bible says that he accuses the brethren day and night so we're bound to come into this this courtroom where the light's shining in your eyes and you're sitting on the on the seat and the prosecutor is is is putting it on you and making you feel like a rat and making you feel like a hypocrite oh he don't make you feel like a rat he wants you to be one of those polished religious hypocrites you know really sophisticatedly evil like you're professing and you're saying i've got the holy ghost and you're saying that i'm a son of god and you're saying that i was in his thinking before the foundation of the world and that the lord said i will send unto you a prophet and you said amen lord that's me and i'm believing that that word of god that he sent by that man i believe in that he's one of those stars in the hand of jesus to reveal to my heart the secrets of god so i could be in fellowship with god and i'm a son of god but now in this courtroom a failure and you're not what you say you are and you polish things up real nice and you have a testimony and you're on the witness stand with a really sharp prosecutor and job got under all of that and he said you know what if i am wicked why am i laboring to be right with god if i wash myself with snow water and make my hands ever so clean yet shall thou plunge me in the ditch and mine own clothes shall abhor me for he is not a man as i am that i should answer him and we should come together in judgment neither is there any days men betwixt us that might lay his hand upon us both a days man it's a beautiful sermon think we've maybe preached on that one time but job's saying there's nobody between this holy god and man that can just put his arms around both of us and says hey guys what's it take to make this right and that's where that word dazed comes from the english courts and that's quite another subject but job didn't have that so here is job in this house of clay abhoring this clay that he's in and he's saying what is man that thou should us magnify him what is man that thou should visit him and you might say brother dennis we're well aware of all these things but if god help us to go quickly and we would go a little further you might say that you know man was disobedient in the garden and then so god said life's going to be hard and it's very easy for religious people and mankind to kind of understand it that way you know that the sin in the garden was disobedience and just let us leave it at that we don't need to go into detail we don't need to know but but man is so suffering with this affliction in this tabernacle that when you begin to speak about how you got in this condition man says yes i would like to know how i got in this condition and then we say well because of the fall in the garden and you say well what was that fall in the garden and the fall in the garden was eve having an adulterous affair with the serpent and that serpent wasn't a snake but it was the creation it was the uh animal life that was right next to man like scofield made this reference to and satan used that serpent and it's so hard to get out of your mind when you say the word serpent instantly you say snake we just do that but so let's just say this man-like creature so satan used this man-like creature the most subtle of all of the beast to get to eve and to bring his seed into mankind because we know that when god spoke to the serpent he said to the serpent he said i'm going to put an enmity between thy seed and the woman's seed but we know that the woman doesn't have a seed so we know that was the first prophecy about jesus i know this is all review but what happened it would be one thing to say well they were both disobedient and now we have to work by the sweat of our brow and life is hard and and we're in this condition but there's something more there that happened to man is that he took on by that sin he took on in his tabernacle that animal nature that was the avenue that this animal nature came into mankind and i've often used that reference to a little fluffy dog he's your little pet and he's nothing but pure love you know in fur and then let the neighbor dog go to his food dish and see what happens to him your little angel is rip and tear and fight to death and let the blood fly and you're going wow you know foofy what got into you there's nothing got into fufi that was always in foofy but it's the same thing that was in david he was a man after god's own heart he loved god he god used him to prophesy in all of the things that he went through god used those things to speak of our lord jesus christ and he spoke the word of god and described jesus life hundreds of years before jesus ever came but he had in him this curse from the garden and brother branham said that man in his unregenerated condition is worse than a beast man and when we say it we're saying mankind and woman kind and we we don't need to rehearse the evil things that a bad spirit gets on women and men both but mankind they will act worse than animals there's a higher order in animals by nature than what man does so much that they just begin to get farther and farther away from god and degrade themselves more and more and more it's worse than animals so by this fall in the garden we understand by the truths that were revealed by the prophet of god the messenger sent to us he went into these scriptures and god used that prophet to sh to explain to us what happened in the garden and why you're in the condition you're in so then for a young man that that or a young girl or or a young person i i i especially have a a a a compassion for for young people because they're not understanding they're coming into life and they're trying to figure out what's going on with me and they'll come here at the altar and they'll give their heart to the lord jesus with all the purity and sincerity and surrender their life to god and then walk out back into life and a huge temptation comes over them and then they think uh what is that what is that and then they'll think well i must not have been born again that must not be the holy ghost i must that must not have been the real thing and so they're waiting for the next revival to really settle it and then you say talking about young people come on friends come on let's just be real one with another how many times have we said from now on you know from this day in my closet i will never do that again i'm never going to be like that again you know god help me i'm going to drive a steak and i and i won't be tempted with that again i won't let something like that come out of my mouth again i won't let my eyes fall on that again i i won't let that anger raise up in me like some kind of animal this is the day by golly you know you can mark my words that's great you know yeah hey great your words are so much higher and loftier than every man on this earth that's just a complete failure you know but okay we'll mark your words so this nature that we saw manifested in david that we see in ourselves this was the nature that paul spoke about in romans 7. he said with my heart i serve god but i see in my flesh another law working like these laws of physics you know you know what's going to happen to the pen when i throw it up it's going to keep just going because what goes up comes down it's the law of physics and in in and these laws are in all of god's creation and paul saw in his body a law that he didn't like but it was there and it it it caused him so much consternation that he finally cried out and he said oh wretched man that i am oh wretched man he hated it he hated to see it he he he saw this perfect love that he had for god he saw this realm of pure fellowship he could be with god he he he saw this thing that god put in his heart to love his fellow man it's something that god put in his heart to make himself a servant to others it's something that god put in his heart to forsake his own life and and let himself be as nothing and he said it's not i that liveth but it's christ that liveth in me he saw god's working in his life and he had to do as you and i do we marvel at what god's doing in your heart and we say like david said what is man who am i lord that you come close to me and draw me to yourself who am i lord that you would reveal the secrets of your heart who who am i that i should know what happened in the garden that i should know what really happened at pentecost that i should know that you should make known to me really what the new birth is and that you can show me what forgiveness of sin is that i should know these things who am i that you should bring me in this realm of fellowship with you lord and paul had all of those things but he looked at the tabernacle that he was in and he said oh wretched man that i am but god chose paul to explain to us who jesus really is remember in the scripture it said they started to believe on his name while they didn't believe it wasn't that they believed that his name was jesus but they started saying to see who he was that he was not just a rabbi that he was not just one of the prophets and so in the book of hebrews paul begins to say now in former times god spoke unto us by his prophets and and showed us who he was by the word but in these last days he's spoken unto us through his son jesus so now god was living in this man jesus declaring his very nature he was the express image of god he was the perfect expression of god he was this logos in in flesh and at christmas time we celebrate god being born in a manger and you know it's a beautiful song isn't that a beautiful song that says we sang it this morning that says let the word be born in the manger of my heart and that one verse said it's just a lonely just a lowly stable hardly a place where a king would be born and then that that raises up in us yes lord let that be me but you know that picture of jesus being born in a manger is only in symbol and type and you know we think of how that brother bradham preached a sermon called uh why it had to be shepherds and he talked about how that the high priest couldn't go in there because they'd have their nice robes on and they'd be holding their nose and tiptoeing through the manure and you know it'd be no place for somebody high and haughty like that but the shepherds could come in there because they were used to all that stinky smell and all that dirty mustiness and the the animals and you know all this straw and hay and and dirtiness and you know that was nothing to them and then we think of the lovely lord jesus the emmanuel god with us born as a baby and then wrapped in that swaddling cloth of an ox that was sweating and plowing the fields and they put that rag between the yoke and his neck and he just labored and stunk and sweated and it got to be that ratty cloth and then this proud mother wrapped her little infant baby in that but i'd like to invite you to entertain the thought this morning that that all looks pretty good when we think of jesus and the tabernacle that he came to not the manger not the swaddling cloth but what kind of man did when he came when god came to tabernacle with man what what did he come to and that's what paul was trying to express in the book of hebrews and he said now he didn't come as an angel and then brother branham comments on that and it's also he talked about how angels were also a type of prophets but paul was saying he didn't come as angel nor as a prophet although we know that adam said the lord your god will raise up a prophet like unto me we know that but what paul was trying to express in the first few chapters of hebrews was is who jesus was and he says in hebrews the second chapter he said for unto angels hath he not put into subjections the world to come whereof we speak but one in a certain place testified saying what is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou visitest him thou made us this is hebrews 2 7 now we are on thou madest him a little lower than the angels thou crownest him with glory and honor and didn't set him over the works of thy hands thou has put all things subject under him for in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not under him but now we see not yet all things put under him who's he speaking of man man and man no matter how good he was he was subject to death he's heading for death like the animals had for death every man is heading for death so this is the tabernacle this is the robe that jesus wore this is whom he became when paul said he but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man i'd like you to think about that this morning taste death you ever eat something and you want the other person to taste it and they refuse and you're just saying this is so good and they say i don't want to touch it and you no no no you don't understand just taste a little bit and you'll be convinced you just got to have it on your own taste buds and then you'll know another's like no no no no i'm not i'm not touching that so what's it take they got to taste it and you could tell them well they could say well just describe it for me and that'll be fine no when we're not saying those things to be funny this morning we're laboring that god might help us this morning to understand that he came to taste death for every man and he had to become flesh for that stinger to hook in there it had to be flesh the curse was on flesh he had to become flesh so that that stinger of death could anchor and we always think well the way we think of the scripture is we think that the the sting of sin is death is that what the scripture says no the sting of death is sin you see that's what makes death fearful that's why man feared every death it's because he knew he had to face god and and and the sin question was there so that's what the sting of death was because if there was no sin what would be death so that's how jesus took the sting out of death is he took the sin out of it because that sin anchored in him because he became not dust man so a lot of us too many times we think that way i know i have that's why i'm preaching that this morning because we see that you can go many many years and not have the revelation that god really wants you to have jesus did not come as dust man just step into that remember when he went and saw abraham and he said step into that gabriel dust body step into that wormwood i don't know who he said was the other angel and then he stepped into that that was god in dust man that was not jesus that was christ that was the anointed one that was god that was the spirit of god in a dust man body but it wasn't jesus no when jesus came jesus came as sinful man that same curse that came upon man that animal nature that was in man and all of those feelings and temptations and sufferings all of that that was in man jesus became son of man that's what he introduced himself all the time he said to peter who does man say that i the son of man am he was declaring who who what condition he was in he didn't come as son of god he didn't come as an angel he became a son of man he was declaring his humanness peter said peter didn't say well you're jesus like i know your name you know i know you you're dave right oh perhaps not dave you know but he didn't say you're jesus he said thou art the christ the son of god so jesus is saying who am i the son of man he's declaring who he is and peter's declaring who i am and he said you got it peter but you know we we we know a sermon title you know god called man and it's kind of a a thing it depends on how you want to look at that group of words and and and if you're aspiring maybe you feel a call of god on your life and you're thinking you know am i a god-called man you know am i called of god well all of us are called of god you know we're a god called people so we think of well a god called man but but the the real expression of the sermon was god called man you know god working god moving god doing something and people saying it's just a man but it was god but look at jesus when he was on earth and declaring himself amongst mankind he was calling himself the son of man because he took on sinful flesh if you would look up some of these scriptures and that's where we fail saints of god we read something like hebrews and and we don't even look up the footnotes so paul is quoting all these scriptures from the old testament and and we we just kind of read on until we find something we understand we just press on you know this is our bible reading this week i'm going to read hebrews and to be honest with you most of chapter 2 i didn't know if he was talking about man or jesus or who but anyway we got here farther to something we understood why why should we live like that saints but if we would run the margins and we'd hear and brother brother paul says excuse me in verse 12 saying i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will i sing praise unto thee well he's quoting david i will declare thy name unto my brethren but you go over there in in psalms 22 and it's a familiar psalm to most of us it starts out my god my god why hast thou forsaken me you know they've pierced my hands and my feet you know they gave me gall and i was thirsty they gave me vinegar and all these psalms we see christ in there and so here in chapter 2 paul is telling us that he was not ashamed to call us brethren for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of abraham look at what condition the seed of abraham was in the day that he came all the religious confusion and the scribes and the pharisees and the roman occupation and and all the dis uh harmony and everything in the seed of abraham and jesus walked right in to the middle of it as one of us wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to god to make reconciliation for the sins of the people the time is getting late let me read something that brother bradham said quoting that scripture same scripture again it won't hurt us to hear it again wherefore in all things that behooved him to be made like unto his brethren his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to god to make reconciliations for the sins of the people to reconcile now god knowing justice had to become unjust to feel what it was to be a sinner to go back to reconcile through reconciliation and have mercy on the people god could not suffer in spirit he had to become flesh to feel the pain of sickness to feel the temptation of lust to feel the temptation of want to feel the temptation of hunger to feel the power of death that he might take it upon himself to stand in the presence of the great spirit jehovah the spirit not the man the spirit to make intercessions to this life and jesus took that in order to make intercessions for us for he knows how it feels when you get sick he knows how you feel when you're tempted he knows how you feel now did you ever notice when he when we vote for president every farmer will vote for a president that's been a farmer for he knows the hard part of a farmer's life see he wants some man who understands and before god could ever understand him being that great holiness how he could ever understand after he condemned man by his holiness he condemned man and the only way he'll ever know how to justify man is to become man the only way he'll ever know how to justify man is to become man isn't that a lot different understanding to say god knows all things god's omnipotent god knows every man you know when when we read in in john there in the beginning of the service and we say well you know god knows man and he knows what's in man and and we when we when we get in trouble and and when we fail the lord and we say lord you saw everything you saw how i failed you you saw how i didn't measure up today and and i'm not hiding anything because you know everything and that's where our disconnect comes we begin to feel dirty and we begin to feel wretched and like paul said when we we feel weary and we begin to apologize to god and we say god i shouldn't be weary like this with all the word of god i know with with you know what i know about romans 28 2 or 8 and 28 all things work together for good i should be strong i i i should be built up in the word of god i should be doing different and and you know all things so you know where i'm at lord no no that's so wrong it's true but it's so wrong it isn't that he knows what's going on with you it's that he knows because he was there he's been weary he's been sick he's been tempted i remember the first time i heard somebody quote brother branham say jesus was tempted with lust i my eyes dropped open and the brother laughed at me he said what you'd think you didn't think so i have to be honest no i didn't think so why because i was thinking that jesus was walking amongst us with like step into that oh no no no that swaddling cloth was a real pretty picture compared to the sinful man that he dwelt in he became sin for us he took on flesh he was every bit man and he called himself the son of man he felt it he feels what you're feeling and you think oh i shouldn't feel this way it's just it's your man nature you're weak he was weak you're tired mentally tired he was mentally tired you're tempted to throw in the towel he was tempted he went to the garden and he feared death so much the bible says it was seen in that he feared he said lord let this cup pass from me but when a vision came he could raise the dead when that anointing that was with him showed itself but god took that off of him so he'd go to calvary and die like a man oh friends we'd only understand the heart of god i can go over and as i did the other day and read moses ten commandments and i thought oh my goodness for me to look over at something and say i wish i had that that's coveting and i said to myself reverend mcgary i'll just use that expression reverend mcgary this is pretty fundamental stuff this is the ten commandments you're supposed to learn that stuff in in bible school in in sunday school and i had to say to myself you know you know self it would do you some good for just some old-fashioned godly fear that hey the ten commandments say don't do that and i should be saying yes sir but we get down the road and we get all sophisticated with all kinds of teaching now we're too big for that just to say yes sir lord but now we're we're you know we're we're beyond all that but that's all right god didn't want that god didn't want you to shake in your britches and say i know everything you do i know you say oh you know i'm bust i'm i'm guilty he knows i'm just guilty that's not what god that's not what's going to bring you close to god what's going to bring you close to god is to recognize the love of god that he came to live in the same tabernacle that you're living in and when you feel weary and when you feel ashamed he knows what it's to be ashamed they hung him naked on calvary he knows what shame is he didn't just bear your sins to calvary he bore your shame there i don't know if if i'm an odd bird but you know a lot of times i can kind of bring my sins to calvary and lay them before the cross and say you know i i lay these training it was wrong lord i knew better i don't want to live like that and i lay my sins here and your blood covers my sins but then i'm so ashamed that i did that i'm just ashamed and then you think well you know that i'll carry because i've got to carry that because you know i did it no you don't have to carry that he bore your shame he knows what it feels like and he tasted death for us that we don't have to taste that how could he be a real kinsman and just have a body he had to become our kinsmen he lived in it he knows jesus knows the pain you feel he can save and he can heal oh i'm not gonna be praying the same way saints lord you know you know what i did you know you're omnipotent oh but how different it is to say jesus you know then the love of god wells up in you and you start to recognize why and you had terms in your mind that didn't mean anything to you and then you understand why he called himself the son of man so that you would know that yeah i lived right where you're at when you pray that's how he's our high priest if god help us to go a little farther into the high priest tonight god bless you this morning saints of god let's stand together he didn't take the form of angels he took the form of sinful man jesus knows the pain you feel he can save and he can heal as we just wait on the lord a moment isn't healing a beautiful thing healing that comes from god [Music] reconciliation that could you imagine someone saying the only way god could understand is to become man that's what god wanted us to know that's why he sent the prophet to to put it to where we can understand it god had to become man to really [Music] understand and when we [Music] want to turn our shoulder and turn away from the lord in shame he's trying to get us to turn back around and say don't turn your head don't turn from me i i know i lived that i lived what you're feeling i felt it let's bow our hands dear lord jesus [Music] you were the fountain of holiness purity pure love everything clean and right and true and unspotted and uncompromised and yet lord you weren't ashamed to come and [Music] be a brother to us not in some diplomatic sense not in some theology lord but you came in flesh to experience the things that we do like [Music] we want to accept that today we want to believe it would you make that real in our hearts lord next time we fall down and try to get up we could think you had to get up [Music] on that road to calvary under that cross you had to get up you know what it is to feel pain in your body you know how it felt to be despised you know how it felt to be rejected unappreciated misunderstood [Music] you felt it lord why do we despise ourselves lord and think we're so out of the way when we're just being partakers of your divine nature and if we saw that you could tabernacle in flesh once and you could come and live in a body like this once how excited we get lord to know that that's exactly what you promised to do again by the baptism of the holy ghost by your spirit coming and living in us lord just exactly again [Music] then we could go to you like our brother lord like one of us like our kids and say lord you understand you know i love you lord you know i i want to be right i want to have fellowship [Music] i know you understand lord be my high priest i surrender this morning lord all my concepts about you and who you are i
