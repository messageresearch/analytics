[34:14] o'clock
[34:15] whatever the lord leads and
[34:17] we'll always have at least two folks two
[34:20] brothers brother and sister so that
[34:22] they don't end up with somebody alone a
[34:24] brother and sister alone here and be a
[34:26] little uncomfortable
[34:29] but take your burdens to the lord
[34:31] come and talk with him let him answer
[34:33] back to you
[34:34] he is faithful to do that
[34:38] now
[34:39] brother dan evans i spoke with him on
[34:41] tuesday this past week
[34:43] he was coming back from
[34:46] jeffersonville
[34:48] and i called him early and he didn't
[34:49] answer and he realized he was on flying
[34:51] back home then
[34:53] but he talked in the afternoon
[34:56] and he said brother aaron even if you
[34:57] asked me to minister this wednesday i'm
[34:59] so tired i couldn't
[35:01] so we had asked brother lyle and then
[35:04] today he was going to be in flagstaff
[35:05] ministering a
[35:07] flash flagship tabernacle with brother
[35:09] steve robson in the church up there
[35:11] and this coming wednesday he'll be
[35:13] ministering for brother osorio from
[35:14] jerusalem tabernacle
[35:17] here in town they've been invited to him
[35:18] and he's gone out
[35:20] i spoke with brother robert figueroa
[35:22] because he's been in my heart to have a
[35:24] minister but him and sister dahlia have
[35:26] been struggling in their health some
[35:28] sister delia
[35:30] they thought she might have had
[35:31] bronchitis they took her into the
[35:32] hospital
[35:34] or the emergency and she was didn't have
[35:36] bronchitis but not doing well and was
[35:38] being brother robert yesterday and he
[35:40] didn't have much of a voice
[35:42] and he said tell the saints that i'm not
[35:44] ignoring them or in any way don't want
[35:46] to be there he said just
[35:48] it's been physically hard in there
[35:50] they've moved out of their house and
[35:51] they moved into
[35:53] with their
[35:54] daughter betting son-in-law brother jude
[35:56] they're in the property and they're
[35:58] staying in the little
[36:00] apartment place that they have there
[36:02] while they prepare their house being
[36:04] paid and clean up they're going to sell
[36:05] it move closer
[36:07] to tucson be on this side a little
[36:09] closer
[36:10] and it's been a lot of work for them so
[36:12] he just said remember them in prayer
[36:15] and we told him we would do the acting
[36:18] see the lord would strengthen them and
[36:20] they're staying in the apartment there
[36:22] or the house i'm not sure exactly what
[36:24] they call it
[36:25] but it's where ruth was living at the
[36:27] end
[36:28] and he said the memories have been hard
[36:30] to deal with
[36:31] so he said just keep us in prayer
[36:33] and until you've gone through that you
[36:35] really don't know what it is
[36:38] but we can keep them in prayer and we
[36:40] can say lord comfort them strengthen
[36:42] them
[36:43] and i told them we would do that so
[36:45] [Music]
[36:46] trust in the lord to lead us along
[36:49] to go with us to guide our steps
[36:52] so we would let him have his way and
[36:54] this evening brother peter
[36:56] mcfadden's with us and
[36:58] i've
[36:59] i had asked him the other day and
[37:02] he's got a young family and busy and
[37:04] they're doing work at the house and it's
[37:06] quite busy at the time but he said if
[37:08] the lord will give me something we'll
[37:10] plan on sunday evening
[37:13] he called me yesterday afternoon he said
[37:15] the lord laid something on my heart so
[37:17] we can do that so if you'll stand with
[37:19] me
[37:22] and see what the lord has for us if you
[37:24] have a need
[37:26] god knows it
[37:28] and he take and take a minister and i've
[37:29] heard it many times from different
[37:31] ministers they said i had this and this
[37:33] and god pulled me this way
[37:35] and took me that way because somebody
[37:37] out there had a need
[37:39] and go administered so

[43:03] in that night was belshazzar the king of
[43:05] the chaldeans slain
[43:07] and darius the median
[43:09] took the kingdom being about three score
[43:12] and two years old
[43:13] and now while you're standing let's go
[43:15] to revelation chapter 11
[43:17] and we'll read the 15th verse
[43:29] and the seventh angel
[43:31] sounded
[43:32] and there were great voices in heaven
[43:35] saying the kingdoms of this world are
[43:37] become the kingdoms
[43:38] of our lord
[43:40] and of his christ
[43:41] and he shall reign forever and ever amen
[43:44] you may be seated
[43:47] give your feet some rest
[43:50] this is um
[43:52] i don't know if this is part
[43:54] two of two but this is the the second
[43:58] installation
[43:59] in
[44:00] a short or long series on feet
[44:03] so last time i spoke about feet
[44:06] and
[44:07] tonight i want to speak some more about
[44:09] feet and current events
[44:11] so
[44:13] don't think i'm too strange it's in the
[44:14] bible so it's it's good for
[44:18] instruction and encouragement and
[44:19] correction
[44:21] amen and
[44:22] we all have feet so might as well just
[44:24] stone up to it
[44:28] okay
[44:31] so
[44:32] current events are interesting right now
[44:33] i don't know
[44:35] different people are engaged to
[44:37] different degrees
[44:39] some people
[44:40] look maybe
[44:41] [Music]
[44:42] a lot at that some people look a little
[44:45] but
[44:46] unless you've been living under a rock
[44:48] you probably know there's there's war
[44:50] and rumor of war and
[44:52] conflict and
[44:53] over in ukraine especially there's
[44:56] there's this fighting and um it's
[44:59] especially
[45:00] interesting to us
[45:02] this war because there's always these
[45:05] these wars and things and some people
[45:07] say well why why doesn't everyone get
[45:08] all um
[45:10] pay as much attention when there's a war
[45:12] in africa or and
[45:15] part of asia or something well
[45:17] this this conflict is especially
[45:20] interesting to us
[45:23] because we've been told to watch russia
[45:26] and so when when russia does something
[45:28] now we know
[45:29] things are interesting
[45:31] something's going on
[45:33] and
[45:34] um
[45:36] so what's happening you could you could
[45:38] ask that to a lot of different people
[45:39] and you maybe get a lot of different
[45:41] answers and you could ask that to
[45:43] different preachers and you get
[45:45] different um
[45:47] different answers to that probably a lot
[45:49] of correct ways that you could answer
[45:51] that from different perspectives what's
[45:52] going on
[45:55] but i think that the
[45:56] [Music]
[45:58] one way to answer that question of
[45:59] what's going on
[46:01] is this world is falling apart
[46:04] i think that that's kind of a short way
[46:06] to answer it
[46:07] and there's a sermon that brother
[46:09] branham preached entitled that this
[46:11] world is falling apart and so i was
[46:13] listening to that and i got a lot of um
[46:15] encouragement out of that and so if you
[46:17] want to
[46:18] when you go home and listen to that i
[46:20] think you would be blessed by it
[46:22] but it's like the the song that my
[46:25] friend john
[46:26] borland sang he got up and he's saying
[46:28] this world is in trouble
[46:30] and we really do need you
[46:32] and i believe that i believe
[46:34] this world is in trouble
[46:37] and we really do need the lord
[46:40] but i want to talk about current events
[46:42] and sometimes you like you kick back and
[46:44] you're like well that's that's across
[46:46] the world
[46:47] um
[46:48] what about me and and this monday that's
[46:50] coming
[46:51] but i want to
[46:52] i want to kind of bring it down home
[46:55] and talk about this world
[46:58] is in trouble
[47:00] if i get away
[47:02] from the leading of the lord
[47:04] and and these things that you can read
[47:07] in daniel in revelation
[47:09] they make sense of of the whole world
[47:12] but then also they can make sense of
[47:14] this world
[47:16] that there's a there's a major
[47:17] application of it in a minor application
[47:19] and sometimes the minor application
[47:21] because it's personalized
[47:23] can be very meaningful to the individual
[47:26] to myself and so i want to say
[47:29] i really do need you lord
[47:31] in in this age that part of the
[47:33] anointing for this age
[47:35] is this spirit that says i don't need
[47:36] anything i'm rich
[47:40] but there's a people
[47:43] that
[47:45] are hearing this word
[47:48] they're hearing this voice that's
[47:49] saying come out of her my people
[47:52] and
[47:53] there's a people that are
[47:55] have their eyes opened
[47:57] to what's going on
[47:59] and they realize when your eyes are open
[48:01] you realize that you really do need the
[48:03] lord
[48:04] that you really do need
[48:06] the spirit of the lord to survive in in
[48:09] this day of
[48:11] current events
[48:12] um
[48:14] you know there's all this
[48:16] economic trouble and
[48:18] unrest within the country and unrest
[48:20] outside
[48:22] but
[48:23] god has always made a way for his people
[48:25] and that's that's one of the great
[48:27] things that we see in the book of daniel
[48:29] see it's it's this pair right there's
[48:31] the book of daniel and the book of
[48:33] revelation and they talk a lot about the
[48:36] same things you can find the same beasts
[48:38] and horns and
[48:39] powers
[48:40] and
[48:41] a lot of it is
[48:45] a little bit difficult to understand
[48:48] because it's in types and shadows and
[48:49] now we have we're blessed that we had a
[48:52] prophet that could
[48:53] unpack a lot of this to us but still
[48:58] a lot of times it's kind of hard just
[49:00] reading you know the second half of
[49:02] daniel and revelation it's kind of hard
[49:04] to say okay well what does that mean for
[49:06] me and the lord
[49:08] the lord will show it to us so we don't
[49:10] just give up on it and say well uh
[49:12] i'm not even gonna try if we'll seek the
[49:15] lord he'll open that to us
[49:17] but also what's really nice
[49:20] is that daniel is split into two hats
[49:24] if you look at the book of daniel and
[49:25] it's actually i found out read and
[49:28] written
[49:28] originally in two different languages
[49:31] so it's written in aramaic and hebrew
[49:33] and and there's kind of this um
[49:36] multiple aspects to the book of daniel
[49:39] and what's really nice
[49:41] is that
[49:43] the best kind of textbooks they'll give
[49:46] you the theory
[49:47] and then they'll give you some practical
[49:49] examples
[49:50] say okay here's here's
[49:52] the big picture here's what's going on
[49:55] now here's what this looks like
[49:57] in practice in application
[50:00] and that's kind of what is go to me
[50:02] that's kind of what's going on in the
[50:04] book of daniel is
[50:05] you've got the first half
[50:08] about of daniel
[50:10] are these
[50:11] beautiful
[50:12] and simple stories
[50:15] that even our children can can
[50:17] understand daniel in the fiery furnace
[50:19] and
[50:20] they're not danging on the fire furnace
[50:21] but she had cracked me shack and a bend
[50:23] to go in the fiery furnace and daniel
[50:25] and the lion's den
[50:27] and i'm so thankful for those stories
[50:29] because
[50:31] what we're finding out looking at these
[50:34] these prophecies and daniel in
[50:35] revelation
[50:36] is
[50:38] the the powers of the earth and and this
[50:41] this system of man and this um big image
[50:44] that started in babylon and
[50:46] and weaves all through history
[50:49] but then we see examples in these
[50:51] stories
[50:53] of how individuals just like you and me
[50:56] can overcome
[50:58] living in babylon
[51:00] and i thank the lord for that
[51:02] because i believe that there in this
[51:04] last day
[51:06] i believe there's going to be an
[51:07] overcoming people
[51:10] by the
[51:12] by the blood of the lamb by the word of
[51:14] their testimony
[51:15] and
[51:16] i so want to be part of that
[51:19] within me
[51:20] there is a desire there
[51:23] to be part of that
[51:24] and
[51:26] and so i'm so happy for these examples
[51:29] that show that
[51:31] to live and overcome in life
[51:34] it's not necessarily understanding
[51:36] everything
[51:39] but it's being obedient to the things
[51:41] that you do understand
[51:43] and overcoming can be as simple
[51:46] as choosing not to eat the king's
[51:48] dainties
[51:50] choosing your diet the things that you
[51:52] consume in your
[51:54] body and your mind maybe
[51:57] that that can be a way to overcome
[52:01] that
[52:02] just refusing to worship
[52:05] in a way that everyone else is
[52:06] worshiping
[52:08] that can be overcoming
[52:11] that praying directly and only to god
[52:15] with no
[52:16] mediator other than christ jesus
[52:19] that that can be overcoming i'm so
[52:21] thankful for these these simple stories
[52:24] that we have
[52:27] so we what kind of sparked me to think
[52:30] about this i was talking to a man just
[52:33] came came by to do some work at my house
[52:35] and we just got talking about things
[52:37] and
[52:39] so of course you make make some joke
[52:41] about world war iii because that's what
[52:42] you do these days
[52:44] and um
[52:47] and ish we shouldn't joke about that i'm
[52:50] that's uh that's my
[52:51] american spirit showing itself that that
[52:54] frivolous spirit but uh i believe the
[52:56] lord
[52:57] will help me with that
[52:59] but i made a joke and and so we were
[53:01] talking about things and he mentioned
[53:04] um
[53:04] something that he recommended i look at
[53:08] and i actually plagiarized the title of
[53:10] that for the title of my sermon
[53:13] so if you read the title of my sermon
[53:14] it's i'll have to have a citation there
[53:17] and
[53:18] what his
[53:20] what he recommended that i look at
[53:22] was this video by a man
[53:26] and named ray dalio and he's a hedge
[53:28] fund man manager
[53:31] and
[53:32] his video is called principles for
[53:35] dealing with a changing world order
[53:38] kind of an interesting title right
[53:41] um and so i watched it and
[53:44] it's it's like a
[53:46] cartoon kind of thing to promote his
[53:48] book i haven't read his book so i don't
[53:49] know maybe his book is
[53:52] great or not great
[53:53] but it was interesting and it got me
[53:55] thinking
[53:57] and basically
[53:59] what he's trying what his opinion of
[54:02] what's going on right now and this is
[54:04] this is a a new video this is current he
[54:07] mentions covert in the video and things
[54:10] but basically he's looking at the world
[54:12] he's an investor
[54:14] and so he's trying to see what's going
[54:15] to happen next
[54:17] investors are very interested to know
[54:19] the future so they can make money on it
[54:21] and so he's looking okay where have we
[54:22] been where are we now
[54:25] where are we gonna go
[54:27] and so he's looking at
[54:29] history and and the patterns there
[54:32] and
[54:34] what he
[54:35] is talking about
[54:37] is
[54:38] in the title it says a world order and
[54:40] what he's referring to there
[54:42] is that
[54:44] for the last several hundred years
[54:47] the political system of the world has
[54:50] been
[54:50] such that there's usually one dominant
[54:53] power
[54:55] and that goes back all the way to daniel
[54:57] right
[54:58] we see in the times of daniel that
[55:00] around that time was the birthing of
[55:03] this way of
[55:05] global politics where there would be one
[55:08] power that would be above the other
[55:09] powers
[55:11] and
[55:12] what's interesting that this man looking
[55:14] back could see what daniel looking
[55:16] forward could see
[55:18] is
[55:18] that there's these changes in power
[55:23] so you have
[55:24] the um
[55:25] what we had what we read there you know
[55:27] your weight in the balance and found
[55:28] wanting
[55:29] well that was this change in power that
[55:31] you had the the king of the chaldeans
[55:34] and they were
[55:36] the supreme power in the world and then
[55:38] below them you had other powers so you
[55:40] had a certain order of powers you had
[55:42] first place second place third fourth
[55:43] fifth
[55:45] and then on this night that daniel
[55:48] interprets what's written on the wall
[55:52] there's a change in the world order
[55:56] number one is no longer number one and
[55:58] there's a new number one
[56:00] and we've we've seen that throughout
[56:03] history daniel salt looking forward this
[56:05] man ray saw looking backwards and so he
[56:08] he's looking back at it and and this man
[56:10] ray he could say okay back in the 1600s
[56:13] it was the dutch there was this east
[56:14] india trading company and they were
[56:16] really powerful
[56:18] and then
[56:20] they lost their position because the
[56:22] english
[56:23] took over and then britain was ruling
[56:25] the world britain was the major
[56:27] superpower
[56:28] for a long time through the victorian
[56:30] era
[56:31] and then
[56:32] after that around the time of world war
[56:34] ii there was this switch again
[56:38] where the united states
[56:40] there was a change in the world order
[56:42] and then the united states was number
[56:43] one
[56:44] and
[56:45] that's all that we've most of us have
[56:47] known
[56:48] in our lifetimes
[56:50] back around the 40s
[56:54] has been the united states
[56:57] as
[56:59] as number one in the world
[57:01] and
[57:02] what's interesting is people
[57:04] these things take so long to change that
[57:06] everyone just assumes that this is the
[57:07] way it's always going to be
[57:10] that you know because it's been this way
[57:12] since the 40s this is just the way the
[57:13] world is but if you zoom out and you
[57:15] look at the bigger picture you can see
[57:17] that
[57:18] you go through these cycles of of powers
[57:21] being strong and then there's moral
[57:23] corruption and and then powers start to
[57:26] decline and you can kind of see there's
[57:27] signs of these these powers declining
[57:30] before they they decline and before
[57:32] another power takes over you can you can
[57:34] see signs of that
[57:36] and so
[57:38] this man ray is looking okay let's let's
[57:40] look at those signs historically how is
[57:42] the united states doing are we are we
[57:45] strong in our values and our education
[57:47] and our innovation
[57:49] no
[57:50] no no no we're we're on the down
[57:53] uh so this is
[57:55] this is troubling for him because he's
[57:57] got a lot of money in the united states
[57:58] right i don't have that problem i don't
[58:00] have a lot of money in the united states
[58:02] isn't isn't that great
[58:06] um our treasures aren't here on earth
[58:10] the treasures are somewhere else
[58:13] wherever our heart is though so if our
[58:14] hearts here
[58:16] bad news the united states goes goes
[58:19] down your treasures might go down too
[58:22] but
[58:22] so this man ray is looking and so his
[58:25] his way of looking at things is okay the
[58:26] united states is is probably gonna
[58:29] drop out in the next couple years and
[58:31] china looks really strong china's
[58:33] probably gonna take over and china will
[58:36] kind of the way that he's talking about
[58:37] china will be the new world power right
[58:40] and
[58:42] china looks really strong and every time
[58:44] there's a change in the world order
[58:46] people generally die and there's this
[58:48] time of turmoil and
[58:50] power is not usually given up freely
[58:52] it's usually
[58:54] these bad times that cause this change
[58:56] of power and so
[58:58] what this man ray is teaching is
[59:01] basically look out things are about to
[59:03] fall apart
[59:05] the the world is falling apart
[59:07] get your money out of the u.s and
[59:09] figure out something
[59:10] some way to save your wealth and your
[59:13] your skin basically
[59:15] and so
[59:16] okay that's nice parts of that makes
[59:18] sense but
[59:20] let's look in here
[59:21] let's do some fact checking
[59:24] let's um let's see if it's fake news or
[59:26] let's see if if it's right let's see is
[59:29] um does this book say china is going to
[59:31] take over
[59:33] let's see
[59:39] so
[59:42] let's
[59:44] let's start with um
[59:46] before we try to look and see if his
[59:48] predictions are right
[59:51] let's see if his current assessment is
[59:53] right because that's easier right
[59:55] his prediction is kind of china's going
[59:57] to take over
[59:58] because the us is is the dominant world
[1:00:01] power
[1:00:02] and the us is slipping
[1:00:04] and so
[1:00:06] must be china's next
[1:00:08] so
[1:00:10] is it true
[1:00:11] that
[1:00:13] the united states is the dominant world
[1:00:15] power
[1:00:17] well who is the current world power
[1:00:20] and
[1:00:21] you know you could say well
[1:00:23] christ is is
[1:00:26] all-powerful
[1:00:27] and so you could say well
[1:00:30] christ would be
[1:00:31] the world power and
[1:00:34] in a sense
[1:00:35] that's right because if he wanted to
[1:00:38] he could do anything
[1:00:42] but his will
[1:00:43] and and what he's
[1:00:45] what his purpose what he's prophesied
[1:00:48] is not that he is
[1:00:50] controlling the world in that way
[1:00:53] he's
[1:00:54] allowed
[1:00:56] this
[1:00:57] world
[1:00:59] to be under the control of satan
[1:01:02] and we can look through there
[1:01:04] in when jesus was on the work on the
[1:01:07] earth
[1:01:08] and he was being tempted of satan
[1:01:10] we can see that satan offered him the
[1:01:12] kingdoms of the world
[1:01:13] if he'd fall down and worship him
[1:01:16] so we could actually see
[1:01:18] that and then when jesus was
[1:01:23] was being questioned before his
[1:01:24] crucifixion
[1:01:27] he said my kingdom is not of this world
[1:01:29] if my kingdom were of this world then
[1:01:31] would my servants fight
[1:01:33] that i should be not be delivered unto
[1:01:34] the jews
[1:01:35] but my kingdom is not from hens
[1:01:38] and we can see
[1:01:40] in the book of revelation like we read
[1:01:42] at the end
[1:01:42] that there's coming a time after this
[1:01:45] seventh trumpet there's coming a time
[1:01:47] when the kingdoms of this world are
[1:01:49] become the kingdoms of our god
[1:01:52] but that's not happened yet
[1:01:56] so right now
[1:01:58] we're living in satan's eden actually
[1:02:02] and
[1:02:03] you don't have to go very far to see
[1:02:05] that's true as as you
[1:02:07] go outside you don't have to go all the
[1:02:09] way to ukraine to see that this is not a
[1:02:11] world that reflects
[1:02:13] jesus christ being in control
[1:02:15] but this is a world that reflects
[1:02:19] a fallen sinful condition
[1:02:23] this is a world that
[1:02:24] people are suffering people are dying
[1:02:27] people are
[1:02:29] selling each other for a little bit of
[1:02:31] profit
[1:02:32] i had a sad thought the other day you
[1:02:34] see these
[1:02:35] these homeless
[1:02:37] people that
[1:02:39] are in such a pathetic situation
[1:02:42] and you see that their life is just
[1:02:45] so ruined a lot of times by drugs and
[1:02:47] alcohol
[1:02:49] you think well
[1:02:50] they did that to themselves they had a
[1:02:52] choice and maybe part of that's true
[1:02:54] but in a sense i had the thought
[1:02:57] these people were sold into slavery
[1:03:01] by somebody else
[1:03:04] somebody
[1:03:05] made a couple bucks selling them their
[1:03:06] first drugs
[1:03:08] somebody made a couple bucks selling
[1:03:10] them their first drink and giving them
[1:03:11] their first cigarette see we do this to
[1:03:13] each other the reason that there's these
[1:03:16] sad
[1:03:17] broken lives
[1:03:19] is because of the evil that's in man's
[1:03:21] hearts that would know that that's going
[1:03:23] to happen to a man
[1:03:25] to a woman to a family
[1:03:27] but a couple bucks is worth more
[1:03:29] to them than say no i'm not gonna
[1:03:32] sell that tobacco that liquor
[1:03:34] what evil we see in this world in that
[1:03:38] that this world is being controlled
[1:03:42] by the devil
[1:03:44] but that's been allowed of god
[1:03:48] because
[1:03:50] he wants to show his attributes right in
[1:03:52] this great drama
[1:03:53] this great story of redemption
[1:03:58] what kind of overcomers would it be
[1:04:00] to overcome in the garden of eden
[1:04:03] oh well you know a tree fell
[1:04:06] the other day and
[1:04:07] i just
[1:04:09] spoke to it and it moved out of the way
[1:04:10] so
[1:04:11] i overcame that problem
[1:04:13] and some of the animals
[1:04:16] were fighting so i just went and talked
[1:04:17] to them
[1:04:18] and
[1:04:20] worked it out
[1:04:22] that wouldn't be much of an overcoming
[1:04:26] but
[1:04:27] what god wanted to show is that this
[1:04:30] little seed
[1:04:32] that he's put in our hearts
[1:04:34] this
[1:04:35] little bit of himself
[1:04:40] like he showed in in the hebrew children
[1:04:43] it wouldn't bend
[1:04:45] it wouldn't break
[1:04:46] it wouldn't burn
[1:04:48] it would overcome even
[1:04:50] in the worst of the worst
[1:04:53] he even took that same seed and he put
[1:04:55] it down in hell
[1:04:57] and rose up triumphant
[1:05:01] it'll do the same thing in this
[1:05:03] hell that's around us
[1:05:04] it'll overcome
[1:05:06] there's got to be something for the
[1:05:08] overcomer to overcome
[1:05:11] and so we've uh we must fight if we must
[1:05:14] win
[1:05:14] but let's let's keep fighting
[1:05:17] so
[1:05:19] we know that
[1:05:21] zooming out that this world
[1:05:24] is not
[1:05:26] directly
[1:05:29] the united states is not
[1:05:31] directly in control because this is
[1:05:33] satan's kingdom
[1:05:35] but satan is powerless
[1:05:38] except moving through men
[1:05:40] we talk about we're we're the hands and
[1:05:42] the feet of jesus right
[1:05:45] sermon
[1:05:46] last one
[1:05:49] and there's other people that are the
[1:05:50] hands and the feet of satan
[1:05:53] and they're
[1:05:54] they're the way that this evil is worked
[1:05:56] in the world
[1:05:58] and so looking
[1:06:00] now
[1:06:01] in this vision of dan in this dream of
[1:06:04] daniel
[1:06:06] you're familiar with the story i think
[1:06:08] if we go back and there's this king
[1:06:10] nebuchadnezzar
[1:06:12] he had a dream
[1:06:13] and he forgot it
[1:06:16] and he um
[1:06:19] he told the wise men you're going to die
[1:06:20] unless one of you tells me the dream and
[1:06:22] interprets it
[1:06:24] and they couldn't do it
[1:06:26] but
[1:06:27] daniel could
[1:06:28] and so he tells the king the dream
[1:06:31] and this is like one of the
[1:06:33] one of the major dreams of all time
[1:06:35] because it tells the whole
[1:06:38] gentile dispensation
[1:06:41] and it's this image
[1:06:44] of a man
[1:06:45] and there's this head and shoulders of
[1:06:47] gold and it goes down to brass
[1:06:50] and iron
[1:06:53] i miss silver there's gold and then
[1:06:55] silver and then brass and then iron and
[1:06:57] the fourth one is iron mixed with clay
[1:07:01] right
[1:07:02] so
[1:07:03] we want to fact check this this man ray
[1:07:06] and he says
[1:07:08] whatever was going on right now
[1:07:12] the united states is going down
[1:07:14] and then china's coming up well just
[1:07:17] counting the numbers
[1:07:19] i already have suspicions because
[1:07:21] we've been told
[1:07:22] that right now we're already in this
[1:07:25] time of iron and clay
[1:07:27] right
[1:07:28] that's where we're at right now
[1:07:30] we had a vindicated prophet
[1:07:32] tell us that
[1:07:33] so i don't need to second guess that i
[1:07:35] can check it with the word and see that
[1:07:37] it's true
[1:07:38] but
[1:07:39] i'm i'm convinced
[1:07:41] that that's where we're at
[1:07:44] and
[1:07:46] i look
[1:07:47] at the number
[1:07:48] that's four out of four
[1:07:51] there's not a fifth world power
[1:07:54] this um
[1:07:55] doesn't say and he's wearing this this
[1:07:57] man is wearing chinese flip-flops
[1:07:59] no that it's just four
[1:08:02] kingdoms
[1:08:07] so
[1:08:10] we don't see that lining up with
[1:08:12] with what's in the word and we can look
[1:08:14] at what brother
[1:08:16] brother branham says
[1:08:18] and
[1:08:19] he says
[1:08:20] in the greatest battle ever fought
[1:08:23] he says
[1:08:24] see don't worry about russia
[1:08:27] see we're looking at russia and china
[1:08:29] are they going to join together and are
[1:08:30] they the next superpower together
[1:08:33] he says si don't worry about russia
[1:08:36] russia is a small pebble on the beach
[1:08:38] don't you worry about communism
[1:08:41] you watch romanism when it's united
[1:08:44] with the churches
[1:08:46] there's nothing written in the scripture
[1:08:47] about communism ruling the world
[1:08:50] and i go by the word regardless of what
[1:08:52] any
[1:08:53] thing else goes it's the word
[1:08:56] i believe
[1:08:57] it's romanism that takes the world
[1:09:01] right
[1:09:04] so we've been living in this roman age
[1:09:06] we know that that
[1:09:07] that goes all the way back to this when
[1:09:10] rome took over the world we can see
[1:09:13] all through history it's been this roman
[1:09:15] spirit that's been controlling
[1:09:17] and this goes down you can look at those
[1:09:20] two legs as
[1:09:21] um
[1:09:22] there was this great split of the roman
[1:09:24] church back a thousand years ago and
[1:09:26] they split into the
[1:09:27] the roman catholic church in the
[1:09:29] orthodox church
[1:09:31] so that could be the two legs or brother
[1:09:33] branham talks about protestantism and
[1:09:35] catholicism being the two legs there but
[1:09:38] you see it's broken down into all these
[1:09:40] different toes
[1:09:42] these ten toes and there's all these
[1:09:44] these little churches
[1:09:47] but basically you can see that
[1:09:49] what's controlling the world
[1:09:51] the power that's controlling the world
[1:09:54] it's not the united states
[1:09:57] but it's this roman spirit that's
[1:10:00] in the form of many toes
[1:10:02] and it's in the form of iron and clay
[1:10:04] it's in the form of things that are not
[1:10:06] mixed together
[1:10:08] and it's ready to fall apart
[1:10:12] so if we're if we're getting ready to
[1:10:14] deal with the changing world order
[1:10:17] we're not going to go put all our money
[1:10:18] in china or russia
[1:10:21] we're going to say oh this whole thing
[1:10:23] is about ready to collapse
[1:10:26] because the next thing that happens once
[1:10:28] you get down where we're at
[1:10:31] to these toes this mix of iron and clay
[1:10:33] the next thing that happens
[1:10:35] is this stone that's cut without hands
[1:10:38] and comes and smites these feet
[1:10:42] and breaks it to pieces
[1:10:46] and um but let's let's just read
[1:10:49] in daniel 2 let's read 31 to 35.
[1:10:54] let's read this
[1:10:56] this is important
[1:11:01] it says
[1:11:02] thou o king saw us this is daniel
[1:11:05] telling him the vision
[1:11:07] the dream
[1:11:09] thou o king solaced and behold a great
[1:11:11] image
[1:11:13] this great image whose brightness was
[1:11:15] excellent
[1:11:16] stood before thee and the form thereof
[1:11:19] was terrible
[1:11:21] the image's head was a fine gold
[1:11:23] his breast and his arms of silver
[1:11:27] his belly and his thighs of brass
[1:11:29] his legs of iron his feet part of iron
[1:11:32] and part of clay
[1:11:33] thou sawest
[1:11:34] till that a stone was cut out without
[1:11:36] hands
[1:11:37] and smote the image
[1:11:39] upon his feet
[1:11:41] that were of iron and clay and break
[1:11:43] them to pieces
[1:11:45] then was the iron the clay the brass the
[1:11:48] silver and the gold broken in pieces
[1:11:50] together and become like the chaff of
[1:11:52] the summer threshing floors
[1:11:54] and the wind carried them away
[1:11:56] that no place was found for them
[1:11:59] and the stone that smote the image
[1:12:01] became a great mountain
[1:12:02] and filled the whole earth
[1:12:05] and then let's drop down to verse 44
[1:12:09] and see
[1:12:10] it says
[1:12:12] and in the days of these kings shall the
[1:12:14] god of heaven set up a kingdom
[1:12:16] which shall never be destroyed
[1:12:19] and the kingdom shall not be left to
[1:12:21] other people but it shall break in
[1:12:23] pieces and consume all these kingdoms
[1:12:26] and it shall stand forever
[1:12:30] so that's what happens next
[1:12:33] we don't have to guess and say okay
[1:12:36] what's it going to be
[1:12:38] this world is falling apart
[1:12:43] and the next world order
[1:12:46] is an everlasting world order
[1:12:49] it's one that's not going to last 250
[1:12:51] years and fade out
[1:12:53] it's not one that's going to start out
[1:12:54] real good
[1:12:56] gold and then by the time it gets the
[1:12:57] end it's
[1:12:59] these nasty clay and iron feet
[1:13:04] no this is a perfect kingdom
[1:13:07] this is the kingdom of christ
[1:13:14] so we have
[1:13:17] good news
[1:13:18] is that you never know
[1:13:20] are you going from a when everything
[1:13:22] switches up are you going to be better
[1:13:23] or worse at the end of the switch-up
[1:13:27] well
[1:13:29] you've got to be on the right side
[1:13:31] but as long as you're on the right side
[1:13:33] this is
[1:13:34] the best change in world order
[1:13:37] the world has ever seen
[1:13:40] see when god
[1:13:42] comes and brings order
[1:13:44] it's a beautiful thing
[1:13:46] you can think he's been
[1:13:49] foreshadowing this all the way back in
[1:13:51] genesis
[1:13:53] when the earth was without form and void
[1:13:56] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[1:14:00] there was no order
[1:14:02] there was disarray
[1:14:04] just like
[1:14:05] was in this world that was in trouble
[1:14:09] but then when the spirit of god moves
[1:14:12] starts to separate the light the
[1:14:14] darkness the land from the water
[1:14:16] starts to bring life
[1:14:21] and if
[1:14:22] if this beautiful creation that we see
[1:14:25] is god bringing order
[1:14:27] before
[1:14:29] and he says that having seen this we
[1:14:31] can't even fathom what's next
[1:14:35] it's going to be something awesome
[1:14:37] it's going to be something beautiful
[1:14:40] and this stone that's breaking this
[1:14:43] system of the world to pieces
[1:14:45] this stone is is a living stone
[1:14:49] the stone is christ
[1:14:51] he's the stone that the builders
[1:14:52] rejected
[1:14:54] has become the head of the coroner
[1:14:57] it says in in matthew 21 and 42
[1:15:02] to 44 jesus
[1:15:04] saith unto them have you never read in
[1:15:06] the scriptures the stone which the
[1:15:08] builders rejected
[1:15:09] the same has become the head of the
[1:15:11] corner
[1:15:12] this is the lord's doing and it is
[1:15:14] marvelous in our eyes
[1:15:16] therefore i say unto you
[1:15:18] the kingdom of god shall be taken from
[1:15:20] you and given to a nation bringing forth
[1:15:22] fruits thereof and whosoever shall fall
[1:15:25] on this stone
[1:15:26] shall be broken but on whomsoever it
[1:15:29] shall fall
[1:15:30] it will grind him to powder
[1:15:33] so there's two options
[1:15:35] there's
[1:15:36] people that fall on this stone
[1:15:40] and they're broken
[1:15:44] but they're not destroyed
[1:15:46] and there's
[1:15:47] there's others that don't fall on this
[1:15:49] stone and they're broken to powder
[1:15:52] so let's let's see how we can
[1:15:54] prepare for this changing world order
[1:15:58] what's the what's the personal
[1:16:00] application of this what what can i do
[1:16:04] well if things are changing
[1:16:05] [Music]
[1:16:07] god always provides a way for his people
[1:16:09] though what's coming is everything
[1:16:11] falling apart
[1:16:13] in
[1:16:14] in a previous
[1:16:16] time when everything was falling apart
[1:16:17] the flood
[1:16:19] god provided an ark
[1:16:21] there's a way of safety
[1:16:23] but we always
[1:16:25] we overlook things a lot of times that
[1:16:27] god's doing because he does them
[1:16:29] simply
[1:16:30] his ways are are so simple that they're
[1:16:33] they're hidden the wise
[1:16:34] and the prudent
[1:16:36] and
[1:16:37] a lot of times the we know that what
[1:16:39] we've been given is god's word
[1:16:42] to hide behind that's our fortress
[1:16:43] that's our safe place
[1:16:46] and we know that this word is powerful
[1:16:50] but what we see a lot of times just like
[1:16:52] jesus said
[1:16:54] is that
[1:16:55] our tendency as humans is to make the
[1:16:57] word of god of no effect by our
[1:17:00] traditions
[1:17:02] and like like matthew 15 9 says but in
[1:17:06] vain do they worship me they do worship
[1:17:08] me teaching for doctrines the
[1:17:10] commandments of men
[1:17:13] so what are our traditions
[1:17:15] do we see this word
[1:17:18] show in power in our life
[1:17:21] or
[1:17:22] has it become ineffective
[1:17:25] because we've fallen for this
[1:17:28] spirit that's ruling the world
[1:17:31] so
[1:17:32] what you'll hear if you take my
[1:17:34] recommendation and listen to this sermon
[1:17:36] the world is falling apart
[1:17:38] is
[1:17:39] brother branham doesn't spend a lot of
[1:17:41] time talking about world politics
[1:17:44] and it doesn't say what part of the
[1:17:45] country to get to and how to stock up
[1:17:48] canned beans and water
[1:17:50] he doesn't spend his time on that
[1:17:54] but what he talks about is
[1:17:57] what jesus was talking about
[1:17:59] is that word effective
[1:18:01] in your life
[1:18:04] is this gospel that you've received this
[1:18:06] way of escape
[1:18:08] is it doing what it's supposed to in
[1:18:12] your life
[1:18:13] because we could see this what this
[1:18:15] roman system is
[1:18:17] that rules the world
[1:18:19] is it something that mixes
[1:18:22] ideas of man
[1:18:24] with the word of god it mixes in
[1:18:26] traditions and paganism
[1:18:29] and it kills the power
[1:18:32] and that spirit
[1:18:35] it's not the united states
[1:18:37] it's not just in russia and it's not
[1:18:39] just in china
[1:18:40] it's so pervasive
[1:18:43] it's moving trying to get into every
[1:18:45] church
[1:18:46] trying to get into every home trying to
[1:18:48] get into every heart
[1:18:49] trying to kill the power
[1:18:53] but just like
[1:18:55] the three hebrew children
[1:18:57] just like daniel
[1:18:59] there's gonna be overcomers in this day
[1:19:02] there's gonna be a people that they
[1:19:04] don't understand everything they can't
[1:19:06] explain everything they don't
[1:19:08] they can't tell you what every verse in
[1:19:10] daniel in revelation means maybe
[1:19:13] but they believe it
[1:19:15] and they don't mix it
[1:19:18] and
[1:19:20] they're ahead of their time
[1:19:23] in that they're already living in that
[1:19:25] next world order
[1:19:28] in this this world that's in trouble
[1:19:32] that system
[1:19:34] that's coming down
[1:19:35] is still the major power
[1:19:38] that's still number one
[1:19:40] out there
[1:19:42] but in here
[1:19:46] can be different
[1:19:48] for you that stone can be effective to
[1:19:52] tear every idea of man down
[1:19:55] in your life to break all that to power
[1:19:57] powder
[1:19:59] and in in your heart and in your life
[1:20:02] the kingdoms of this world
[1:20:05] can already become
[1:20:06] the kingdoms of our christ
[1:20:13] so brother branham his whole ministry
[1:20:17] come out of her my people
[1:20:20] be not partakers of our sins he's not
[1:20:23] talking to people necessarily to say
[1:20:24] come out of the roman catholic church
[1:20:27] he did but that's not his main audience
[1:20:31] he's talking to pentecostals
[1:20:33] and if he was still here he'd be talking
[1:20:36] to us
[1:20:37] to say watch out for that
[1:20:39] power
[1:20:41] that lying roman spirit that mixes in
[1:20:44] ideas of men
[1:20:45] that tries to look so good to the mind
[1:20:50] that looks you know it's golden up here
[1:20:52] this system man
[1:20:54] golden up here
[1:20:56] seems so good to the mind
[1:20:59] but the practical application of it the
[1:21:01] feet
[1:21:02] where the rubber hits the road
[1:21:04] is corrupt
[1:21:06] it's brittle it's weak
[1:21:10] see the devil can make a good mental
[1:21:14] deception
[1:21:16] but he can't walk this walk
[1:21:21] he can't have the feet
[1:21:23] that we talked about last sermon that
[1:21:24] carry the gospel
[1:21:26] that proclaimed good news by the way
[1:21:27] that we live that
[1:21:29] we've become this
[1:21:30] we've eaten this we speak this
[1:21:34] that's what the devil is fighting
[1:21:37] the battle is not in
[1:21:40] ukraine greatest battles were fought
[1:21:44] it's right here
[1:21:45] it's in a
[1:21:47] in our minds in our hearts so what
[1:21:49] brother branham is preaching against
[1:21:51] he's preaching against the things
[1:21:54] that we deal with on a personal level
[1:21:56] when he preaches this world is falling
[1:21:58] apart
[1:22:00] he preaches against sin
[1:22:02] he preaches against worldliness
[1:22:05] not because
[1:22:10] not because your salvation is dependent
[1:22:12] on whether you smoke a cigarette
[1:22:14] but because
[1:22:16] your life tells
[1:22:18] whether this word
[1:22:20] has been made of no effect through your
[1:22:22] traditions
[1:22:26] because this original word if it's not
[1:22:28] mixed
[1:22:29] you won't be living like the world
[1:22:31] you won't have the same appetite
[1:22:34] to eat the king's dainties
[1:22:37] you'll say no i've got a different food
[1:22:39] that i'm feeding on
[1:22:41] it won't make your worship the same
[1:22:44] cold dead
[1:22:45] worship
[1:22:47] and don't just think singing songs think
[1:22:50] of the worship of
[1:22:51] how you act when you're all alone
[1:22:55] what you think
[1:22:57] what are you meditating on
[1:22:59] is is that a true worship
[1:23:02] or are the meditations of your hearts
[1:23:05] worshiping the same image
[1:23:07] that this world has
[1:23:09] of somebody kicked back
[1:23:11] retired early
[1:23:12] easy life
[1:23:16] what are the meditations of our hearts
[1:23:19] are they worship to god are they pure
[1:23:22] or have we can been caught up with all
[1:23:24] this music the sound of
[1:23:26] all these instruments
[1:23:31] in the in
[1:23:33] in that sermon brother branham says we
[1:23:35] want everything just everything so we
[1:23:38] can take it easy and retire and take
[1:23:39] life easy he says life wasn't intended
[1:23:42] to be easy
[1:23:43] life is a struggle
[1:23:45] anything that's got life is a struggling
[1:23:48] look at the trees how they struggle look
[1:23:50] at everything that's got life it's a
[1:23:51] struggle
[1:23:53] and when we try to get some kind of a
[1:23:55] system that takes it easy
[1:23:57] then we're wrong
[1:23:59] and we know there's something wrong
[1:24:02] so when he's preaching against
[1:24:05] the world falling apart he's preaching
[1:24:07] against these spirits these lies that
[1:24:09] come in and try to mix
[1:24:11] mix the
[1:24:13] spirits of this world the spirits of
[1:24:15] babylon into the christians lives
[1:24:19] we're not to be conformed to the image
[1:24:21] of this world
[1:24:22] or to be transformed or to have a new
[1:24:24] mind
[1:24:25] the mind of christ jesus
[1:24:27] where to be different would it be
[1:24:28] peculiar we're the only ones eating
[1:24:30] oatmeal and everyone else is
[1:24:32] eating babylonian things
[1:24:39] he
[1:24:41] see
[1:24:43] when he preaches against sin
[1:24:46] he preaches against
[1:24:47] you know makeup and cutting hair and i
[1:24:49] believe that
[1:24:51] but he also preaches against
[1:24:54] weak preaching
[1:24:56] you know this kind of preaching that
[1:24:57] tells you
[1:24:59] oh everything's okay
[1:25:02] never preaches against sin
[1:25:06] god help us
[1:25:08] god help us not to compromise with this
[1:25:10] word because we can
[1:25:13] we can fall to that even within the
[1:25:14] message
[1:25:15] that it's easy to preach
[1:25:18] only part of the word
[1:25:20] but we want the whole counsel of god
[1:25:23] i want to come to church and i want to
[1:25:24] know when i'm wrong
[1:25:26] i want to have that knife of the word
[1:25:28] cut away this this sin for me these
[1:25:31] where this babylonian spirit's trying to
[1:25:33] grow into my heart
[1:25:35] cut that away
[1:25:40] if you only come to church and
[1:25:42] and leave
[1:25:44] more puffed up
[1:25:45] something's wrong
[1:25:48] but what should be made magnified
[1:25:51] is christ
[1:25:52] the cross the blood
[1:25:55] that's what should be magnified in our
[1:25:57] lives when we leave church
[1:26:00] that we don't look to ourselves
[1:26:02] but we just look to that sacrifice
[1:26:05] anything else see on either side the
[1:26:08] devil try to pull you either
[1:26:11] to look at yourself so much
[1:26:14] and to be so legalistic
[1:26:16] and to be so
[1:26:18] just trying to do
[1:26:20] trying to save yourself
[1:26:24] and that's a lie
[1:26:25] or on the other side he'll try to just
[1:26:28] tell you well god loves you it doesn't
[1:26:29] matter what you do
[1:26:31] no sin sin that's a lie too
[1:26:35] see the truth is
[1:26:37] i can't do anything
[1:26:38] to live a holy life
[1:26:42] but if i'll let that life of christ live
[1:26:44] in me
[1:26:47] and if
[1:26:48] i won't mix anything with that
[1:26:50] but if i just let that original power
[1:26:52] come through
[1:26:54] that will kill sin in my life
[1:26:57] that will let me rise up above the world
[1:27:00] and so we don't look at our at these
[1:27:03] things of sin
[1:27:05] as the final
[1:27:08] you know that's all we're looking at but
[1:27:10] we look at those of markers to see what
[1:27:11] kind of fruits are our lives bearing
[1:27:15] have we been
[1:27:17] made unfruitful
[1:27:20] every vine that bears not fruit
[1:27:23] is cut off and thrown in the fire
[1:27:26] that original life
[1:27:28] will bring forth the original fruit
[1:27:33] in luke 6 26
[1:27:36] jesus says woe unto you when all men
[1:27:38] speak well of you
[1:27:41] for so did their fathers to the false
[1:27:43] prophets
[1:27:46] and
[1:27:47] you know what i'm what i'm talking about
[1:27:49] here
[1:27:50] it was inspired by what
[1:27:52] by what brother branham said about
[1:27:54] preaching how are we preaching this are
[1:27:55] we preaching easy are we preaching the
[1:27:57] full thing
[1:27:59] but
[1:28:00] what you hear in church is not just the
[1:28:02] responsibility of whoever is here
[1:28:06] because what can happen
[1:28:08] is
[1:28:09] you know brother aaron can preach
[1:28:12] the whole gospel but if your ears are
[1:28:15] only open to hear selectively
[1:28:18] you're going to get weak preaching
[1:28:21] even if it's real
[1:28:22] holy ghost preaching
[1:28:24] you can dilute it yourself
[1:28:28] can dilute it in the way you live you
[1:28:29] can come here and you can say amen
[1:28:32] then you go home and you compromise
[1:28:34] you mix it and now you're the weak
[1:28:36] preacher
[1:28:37] you're the one that's mixed the word you
[1:28:39] said amen to it
[1:28:41] in church and i'm preaching to myself
[1:28:43] here
[1:28:44] god help me
[1:28:49] but we can be weak preachers in the way
[1:28:51] that
[1:28:52] we're walking around as those feet
[1:28:56] let's not mix this word let's just
[1:28:58] take it and say lord help me
[1:29:00] i can't live this
[1:29:02] but oh there was a price paid for me at
[1:29:05] calvary
[1:29:06] i believe in that transfusion of power i
[1:29:10] believe in that holy ghost baptism
[1:29:13] anything outside of that
[1:29:15] romanism
[1:29:18] it's cursed
[1:29:20] it's dead
[1:29:21] and it's coming down
[1:29:22] that's crumbling
[1:29:25] but let that be crumbled totally in my
[1:29:28] life
[1:29:29] let this rock
[1:29:31] cut out without hands
[1:29:33] let it just destroy every bit of that in
[1:29:36] me
[1:29:37] that i can be already in that next world
[1:29:40] order
[1:29:40] where there's a mountain
[1:29:42] a mountain of god
[1:29:45] this
[1:29:46] this mountain made me think of the
[1:29:47] statue of a perfect man
[1:29:50] that's got a wide base of faith and it's
[1:29:52] built up
[1:29:53] all the way up to perfect love
[1:29:58] we can live there
[1:30:00] we don't have to
[1:30:01] you know we're we're in babylon just
[1:30:04] like
[1:30:04] shadrach meshach and abednego they even
[1:30:07] got babylonian names
[1:30:09] but they were in babylon babylon wasn't
[1:30:11] in them
[1:30:12] that's the difference
[1:30:14] it's not the water around the boat
[1:30:15] that's the problem it's the water in the
[1:30:17] boat
[1:30:18] see before them there were people
[1:30:20] in jerusalem the holiest of cities
[1:30:24] living
[1:30:25] [Music]
[1:30:26] really good lives
[1:30:29] they had babylon in here
[1:30:32] and that's why they
[1:30:33] were scattered
[1:30:34] that's why they became slaves that's why
[1:30:36] their
[1:30:37] their sons and daughters were taken
[1:30:40] they let it in here
[1:30:42] though they were in the right place you
[1:30:44] know you can be in church you can let
[1:30:46] babylon get in here
[1:30:48] you can let that worldly system come in
[1:30:50] here and
[1:30:52] it's death
[1:30:56] but oh there's still that rock
[1:30:58] i could take that down
[1:31:01] if we just say lord
[1:31:03] have mercy on me
[1:31:05] oh lord this world is in trouble this
[1:31:08] world
[1:31:09] and we really do need you
[1:31:15] but the great thing is
[1:31:17] when christ has come and destroyed the
[1:31:19] works of the devil that's why he came
[1:31:21] didn't he say that he came to destroy
[1:31:23] the works of the devil
[1:31:25] not just out there but in in here that's
[1:31:28] where i really
[1:31:29] want him to destroy the works of the
[1:31:31] devil
[1:31:32] well once he comes and does that once
[1:31:35] we'll fully
[1:31:36] surrender as brother arnie says that's
[1:31:39] when he'll fully fill us
[1:31:41] amen
[1:31:43] and we can read in daniel in revelation
[1:31:45] that there's this terrible mark of the
[1:31:47] beast
[1:31:49] but there's a protection against that
[1:31:53] in these current events where the
[1:31:54] world's falling apart
[1:31:56] there's death everywhere and more death
[1:31:58] coming
[1:32:00] there's a place of perfect peace
[1:32:03] that once you've fully surrendered once
[1:32:05] you've said lord
[1:32:07] i don't want any systems of this man
[1:32:10] of my own thoughts of my own image of
[1:32:11] what a christian life should look like
[1:32:14] see it's very religious
[1:32:16] it's not just
[1:32:19] you know
[1:32:20] worldly roman catholic catholicism but
[1:32:23] it's
[1:32:24] it's peter mcfadden's idea of a perfect
[1:32:26] christian life
[1:32:28] that's death i don't want my idea of a
[1:32:30] perfect christian life
[1:32:32] but once once we can get rid of that
[1:32:34] once we can say lord i don't want my
[1:32:36] ideas
[1:32:37] i want your word
[1:32:39] i want your spirit i want to be fully
[1:32:40] surrendered
[1:32:42] once that's been
[1:32:44] torn down
[1:32:47] and once
[1:32:49] that
[1:32:49] mountain
[1:32:51] of righteousness has taken its place
[1:32:55] it says you're sealed until the day of
[1:32:57] your redemption
[1:33:00] that now though you're still in babylon
[1:33:02] the world is still falling apart all
[1:33:04] around you
[1:33:06] you're set
[1:33:10] your salvation
[1:33:12] you've received the earnest
[1:33:13] you've got the down payment
[1:33:18] we've got a god that's going to finish
[1:33:19] the good work that he started
[1:33:22] and we ought to be so happy over there
[1:33:25] we ought to dance like miriam when she
[1:33:27] crossed the red sea
[1:33:28] oh thank you thank you lord for saving
[1:33:30] me
[1:33:31] once i was lost now i'm found
[1:33:34] amen don't let the devil steal that joy
[1:33:37] from you
[1:33:40] but also in that same scripture
[1:33:43] where it says we're sealed
[1:33:45] it says
[1:33:46] grieve not
[1:33:47] the holy ghost
[1:33:50] so let's while we rejoice
[1:33:53] in this salvation
[1:33:56] let's still keep an eye out for anywhere
[1:33:58] that that spirit's trying to to come
[1:34:02] it can't steal your salvation
[1:34:06] but it can hurt your testimony
[1:34:10] it can
[1:34:13] it can grieve the lord
[1:34:16] you know shadrach meshach and abednego
[1:34:20] they would have still been jews if they
[1:34:21] were eating the king's dainties
[1:34:25] but they were blessed
[1:34:27] for what they did
[1:34:29] they received wisdom
[1:34:31] they overcame
[1:34:33] i believe there's
[1:34:35] i believe we're part of that
[1:34:37] people that's not just gonna survive
[1:34:40] this but
[1:34:42] we're gonna overcome
[1:34:46] we're gonna live above this
[1:34:47] not by
[1:34:49] figuring it out
[1:34:51] but just by his grace by his blood
[1:34:54] because he chose to do this
[1:35:04] so let's just keep
[1:35:06] saying lord open my ears that when i
[1:35:08] hear the word
[1:35:11] i won't water it down
[1:35:13] i won't make excuses
[1:35:15] in the choices that i make
[1:35:18] and when i come into the presence of god
[1:35:20] i won't leave puffed up but i'll leave
[1:35:22] say woe is me
[1:35:25] i've sinned i don't want to be this way
[1:35:29] holy ghost preaching it pricks our
[1:35:31] hearts
[1:35:32] not tickles our ears
[1:35:35] says oh i can
[1:35:37] i can surrender another part of my life
[1:35:39] i've let something come in i've let the
[1:35:41] world come in
[1:35:42] about something
[1:35:45] start to make me a
[1:35:47] one of those fountains that's sometimes
[1:35:49] giving bitter water and sometimes sweet
[1:35:52] don't let our speech be like that
[1:35:55] don't fall for that trick of the devil
[1:35:58] see holy ghost preaching
[1:36:00] it doesn't bind you with burdens but it
[1:36:02] sets you free
[1:36:04] it says i don't have to live like that
[1:36:06] i don't have to talk about my brother
[1:36:08] and my sister that way
[1:36:10] but i can love them and i can talk good
[1:36:12] things about them
[1:36:17] and just stay
[1:36:19] stay straight
[1:36:21] that all our confidence is in christ all
[1:36:22] our confidence is in calvary
[1:36:26] and then we can
[1:36:27] we can prophesy again we can speak that
[1:36:29] same pure word
[1:36:31] we can be a blessing to those around us
[1:36:34] amen
[1:36:44] when we
[1:36:46] when we live this way
[1:36:50] we separate ourselves from the world
[1:36:53] it says in james that the friendship of
[1:36:55] the world is enmity with god
[1:36:58] whosoever therefore will be a friend of
[1:36:59] the world as the enemy of god
[1:37:03] so if we're really hearing that
[1:37:05] really taking this word
[1:37:08] it's going to separate us
[1:37:10] it's going to make us different
[1:37:12] notice
[1:37:13] it didn't make them
[1:37:16] hated for good reason
[1:37:18] they didn't hate daniel because he was
[1:37:20] bad at his job and lazy
[1:37:22] they hated him because he prayed
[1:37:25] so if the world hates you because you're
[1:37:26] not doing good you know the bible talks
[1:37:28] about that
[1:37:29] that's
[1:37:30] that's not the way it should be
[1:37:32] but just
[1:37:34] carry on
[1:37:36] we're not of that world order we're of a
[1:37:38] different world order
[1:37:44] brother branham in the sermon he talks
[1:37:46] about
[1:37:47] yes the lady are you a christian
[1:37:50] she said i burn a candle every night
[1:37:52] and that sounds so silly to us
[1:37:54] who would answer the question that way
[1:37:57] but is that how we
[1:37:58] kind of answer the question are you a
[1:38:00] christian well i did go to church
[1:38:03] three times last week and i
[1:38:05] tried to pray three times a day and i
[1:38:07] did listen to tape
[1:38:09] it's romanism friend
[1:38:14] not gonna get to heaven by how many
[1:38:17] tapes you listen to we should be
[1:38:18] listening to the tapes
[1:38:22] but keep your eyes on calvary
[1:38:25] keep your heart in love with him
[1:38:28] be transformed by the renewing of your
[1:38:30] mind
[1:38:37] i believe the coming of the lord is at
[1:38:39] hand
[1:38:43] that's um i've got a lot of notes but
[1:38:47] i feel like we're
[1:38:50] maybe towards the end
[1:38:53] here
[1:38:54] if
[1:38:59] musicians would come let's let's go to
[1:39:03] let's go to romans chapter eight verse
[1:39:06] nine
[1:39:08] i want to end with that
[1:39:11] the other thing that came to my mind is
[1:39:16] we want to
[1:39:18] want to see the supernatural
[1:39:21] we want to have
[1:39:22] all the promises of god moving as they
[1:39:25] should
[1:39:26] and
[1:39:27] when they'd come to brother branham
[1:39:29] they'd say why are you hollering against
[1:39:31] sin
[1:39:32] why don't you teach these these people
[1:39:34] how to see visions
[1:39:35] and be real spiritual
[1:39:37] you know he'd tell them how can the
[1:39:40] spirit teach us algebra if we won't
[1:39:42] learn our abcs
[1:39:45] i believe if we'll just be obedient to
[1:39:48] what we've what we know
[1:39:49] to do who's right
[1:39:51] if we'll just surrender
[1:39:53] and let the lord tear down everything
[1:39:55] that's of that other world order
[1:39:58] that we'll see the prophesy and we'll
[1:40:00] see the wonders the signs
[1:40:04] because obedience is better than
[1:40:05] sacrifice
[1:40:07] let's um romans chapter 9
[1:40:09] 8 verse 9
[1:40:11] and we'll read down to
[1:40:13] 17.
[1:40:18] romans chapter 8 verse
[1:40:20] verse 9 says but you're not in the flesh
[1:40:24] the systems of man
[1:40:26] but in the spirit
[1:40:28] if so be that the spirit of god dwell in
[1:40:30] you
[1:40:31] now if any man have not the spirit of
[1:40:33] god
[1:40:34] he is none of his see we need to be very
[1:40:37] sure we need to make our call in an
[1:40:38] election sure
[1:40:41] once once you've been sealed
[1:40:44] you're sealed
[1:40:45] don't let the devil shake you from that
[1:40:48] but
[1:40:49] if you let a man
[1:40:50] talk you into
[1:40:53] oh i'm saved i've got the holy ghost
[1:40:55] then another man can talk you out
[1:40:57] and you're always going to be in one way
[1:40:58] out the other day back and forth
[1:41:01] but you settle that with god
[1:41:05] make sure
[1:41:07] and then once
[1:41:09] once you've gone and and worked that out
[1:41:12] if you just um
[1:41:13] maybe play jesus be the lord of all the
[1:41:15] kingdoms of my heart
[1:41:20] make sure
[1:41:21] make sure you've got that oil in your
[1:41:23] lamp
[1:41:25] everything's falling apart
[1:41:27] it's not a time to just
[1:41:29] live haphazardly
[1:41:34] make sure that what's
[1:41:36] what's being manifest in your life
[1:41:40] shows that
[1:41:45] that the spirit of god is moving in your
[1:41:47] life
[1:41:50] it says if if any man have not the
[1:41:52] spirit of christ he is none of his
[1:41:55] and if christ be in you the body is dead
[1:41:58] because of sin
[1:42:00] but the spirit is life because of
[1:42:02] righteousness
[1:42:04] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:42:06] jesus from the dead
[1:42:08] dwell in you
[1:42:10] he that raised up christ from the dead
[1:42:12] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:42:14] his spirit
[1:42:16] that dwelleth in you
[1:42:18] therefore brethren we are debtors not to
[1:42:21] the flesh
[1:42:23] to live after the flesh
[1:42:26] these systems of men for if you live
[1:42:28] after the flesh you shall die
[1:42:32] but if you through the spirit that's the
[1:42:34] key
[1:42:36] through the spirit you mortify the deeds
[1:42:37] of the body ye shall live
[1:42:41] there's a way of escape
[1:42:43] there's safety
[1:42:45] now this verse 14 is
[1:42:48] is really important
[1:42:49] it says for as many as are led by the
[1:42:52] spirit of god
[1:42:54] they are the sons of god
[1:42:57] that's what we need
[1:42:59] we'll say
[1:43:00] this world is in trouble i really do
[1:43:02] need you
[1:43:04] that's how i need him
[1:43:06] i need him
[1:43:08] as lord like brother lyle preached
[1:43:10] jesus is lord
[1:43:12] i need my life
[1:43:14] to preach that
[1:43:16] by the way of these feet walk
[1:43:18] by the things these hands do by the
[1:43:20] meditations
[1:43:21] here
[1:43:22] let it all be led by the spirit of god
[1:43:26] because that's how sons are
[1:43:32] verse 15 says for ye have not received
[1:43:34] the spirit of bondage begin to fear
[1:43:38] fear not little flock amen
[1:43:41] but you have received the spirit of
[1:43:43] adoption
[1:43:46] whereby we cry have a father
[1:43:48] [Music]
[1:43:50] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[1:43:51] our spirit that we are the children of
[1:43:54] god
[1:43:55] and if children than heirs
[1:43:57] heirs of god and joint heirs with christ
[1:44:01] if so be that we suffer with him then we
[1:44:03] may also be also glorified together
[1:44:07] amen
[1:44:09] so his spirit in us it's leading us
[1:44:12] it's bringing us to adoption to that
[1:44:14] place
[1:44:16] that the power of god is
[1:44:18] able to operate through us
[1:44:22] if we'll just surrender
[1:44:24] so just let go of all our ideas of how
[1:44:26] this ought to be done
[1:44:28] all our best intentioned ideas
[1:44:30] it's all romanism
[1:44:32] that's what's ruling out there
[1:44:34] well let's skip into that next
[1:44:36] world order
[1:44:37] [Music]
[1:44:39] where these kingdoms have become the
[1:44:40] kingdoms of our god
[1:44:44] i was thinking
[1:44:46] of that
[1:44:48] we started out with
[1:44:50] about being weighed in the balance and
[1:44:52] found wanting
[1:44:54] and when we really start to hear
[1:44:57] that our ears can be anointed to hear
[1:45:00] this word
[1:45:02] we can be pricked in our hearts that we
[1:45:03] can be convicted
[1:45:06] i can say oh
[1:45:08] i'm wanting
[1:45:10] when i when i add up my life when i
[1:45:13] count up
[1:45:14] my life
[1:45:16] it says you've been numbered
[1:45:18] that's the first part many is you've
[1:45:20] been numbered
[1:45:21] second part is you've been weighed
[1:45:24] third part is
[1:45:25] division you've been divided
[1:45:27] [Music]
[1:45:29] and i thought the only thing that can
[1:45:31] balance that balance
[1:45:33] that can bring me to where i need to be
[1:45:35] that i wouldn't be found wanting
[1:45:38] the only thing that can balance that
[1:45:39] scale
[1:45:40] is that rock
[1:45:43] that living christ
[1:45:46] that spirit of god
[1:45:49] oh i really do need him
[1:45:52] amen but he's here
[1:45:54] he's never left us
[1:45:56] it says we haven't received the spirit
[1:45:57] of bondage again to fear
[1:45:59] this word that comes doesn't come to
[1:46:01] put you in terror and put you in chains
[1:46:04] find heavy burdens on you that you can't
[1:46:06] carry
[1:46:08] it comes to say son daughter you're free
[1:46:13] go bearing that blood
[1:46:15] the two doves
[1:46:17] the one
[1:46:18] killed
[1:46:20] his blood is sprinkled on the other one
[1:46:23] that's us
[1:46:25] we can just go
[1:46:27] it's not my blood
[1:46:29] it is
[1:46:31] it's not my righteousness
[1:46:33] it's his
[1:46:35] it's not my life it's his
[1:46:40] let's just stand and
[1:46:42] bow our heads and
[1:46:44] my head bowed to
[1:46:47] if there's anybody here that's
[1:46:50] maybe been convicted
[1:46:52] [Music]
[1:46:55] and would just say in their heart
[1:46:57] this world myself i'm in trouble lord
[1:47:01] and i really do need you
[1:47:04] just lift your hand to him i'm not
[1:47:05] looking
[1:47:06] don't be looking around but just raise
[1:47:08] your hand to him and say lord help me
[1:47:12] god come and tear down
[1:47:15] these
[1:47:16] systems of man
[1:47:20] let me worship you in spirit and in
[1:47:22] truth
[1:47:23] oh god we're here
[1:47:25] [Music]
[1:47:26] believing that you help us
[1:47:29] believing that you've made a way of
[1:47:30] salvation lord a way that we can
[1:47:34] not just be saved but that we can
[1:47:35] overcome
[1:47:37] at these feet that used to walk in sin
[1:47:40] and used to be bound in chains
[1:47:44] that these feet would walk out on the
[1:47:45] ashes of the wicked
[1:47:47] here in our own lives lord
[1:47:50] that i could walk out on the ashes of
[1:47:52] the sins in my own life
[1:47:54] i could live above that lord that your
[1:47:56] holy fire would just come and purify my
[1:47:58] life
[1:48:00] in the lives of these people lord that
[1:48:02] we wouldn't sin against you that we
[1:48:03] wouldn't grieve your spirit lord
[1:48:06] but seal us all father
[1:48:09] help us to be totally empty of our own
[1:48:12] thoughts lord of our own righteousness
[1:48:14] of our own
[1:48:16] ways lord and
[1:48:18] would you just come and
[1:48:20] help us
[1:48:23] i'll have mercy on us lord we know you

[1:48:54] we can't be proud in that because we
[1:48:55] know that
[1:48:56] we had nothing to do with that
[1:48:59] was just your
[1:49:00] mercy on us lord that you chose us in
