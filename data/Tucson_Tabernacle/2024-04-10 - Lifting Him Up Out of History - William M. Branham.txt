========================================

through our lane there where we live at morning it's like a racetrack have to hurry home to wash the dishes or listen to Arthur God for your something where are you going what's the matter what's got the thing all upset is because men and women have become lovers of this present World great thing ought to be would be come home to read the Bible into time to pray I think about John Wesley's mother Suzanne she was a mother of 17 children and she had time to spend I think it was either two or three hours every day in prayer and raised and mother 17 children which brought forth one of the world's greatest preachers and one of the greatest songwriters of the day Charles and John because she took time to serve God and not dally in the things of the world and when we seen our foundation of our nation the foundation of our home the foundation of our church sinking then Brethren what can we do and I want to say this oh if I had a voice I could EO to the the world we have a solid foundation left and that's God's blessed holy word the Bible for all heavens and earth will pass away but God's word shall never pass away and upon found this Rock God said I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it so what a blessed privilege it is to all of us to reach over and get God's good old Bible and turn the pages back and know that we're reading directly truth praise the Lord and to see that these times happened in days gone by for it speaks of a historical God and the only way that we're ever going to be to cope with these ways are to to to fall in line is to call up out of history that historical God or through all days of the andalan destruction before the coming of Christ and different events he never fails when he called on he's always right I'm thinking of a time now that when a nation was in captivity it was Israel and they were down in Egypt and was made hard and rigor to serve the Egyptians it seemed like that everybody had just grown cold did you know Israel was in Egypt twice as long as the United States has been a nation we're not over about 150 or 70 years old something like that and they were 4 20 years in bondage or down in Egypt but it come a time when seemed like that all hopes is gone but there was one man and woman who seemed to have faith in a historical God that spoke to Abraham in the time of Crisis and they believed they could call on him and he'd answer that was ham amram and jehos the wife of H uh amram the mother and father of Moses and it's year sometime ago I was preaching and gave a little illustration of how that amram would come home at night and he'd say Jose I am so tired and the fresh lashes on his back from a a task Master's whip and she would sit down patiently perhaps and wash out the the places and weep and say oh am isn't there something that can be done I would hear him say oh dear if you'd have been with me today and seen them beat them young boys trying to pull those loads but they were heartless they treated him like they were animal and that's our young man of Israel isn't there something can be done that's what I wonder now to see our young teenage boys that will be the men and women of Tomorrow our teams today hair down in their neck and bres pulled out over their hips of the pistol stuck in their side and a cigarette and the side of their mouths what will it be it's still slavery under the devil isn't there something that can be done and amran perhaps one of the only ones of the nation would climb up a little stair steps regardless of how tart he was there each night he'd call on the god of Abraham one that he learned that come to Abraham and come to job and come to Isaac and come to Jacob and hours of distress and surely if he was God in their day he'd be God in that day and if he was God in Moses day he's God today amen he just needs to be called up out of History and called on the scene of action and I can see amram night after night no matter how tired that proved his faith in that God but today the people if they don't get everything they asked for the first time they pray they seem to think that he's dead what we need is man and women today of God's spirit man and women who are determined to hold on till they see a God that really lives come into action that will not take no for an answer they're determined to stay with it if they are sick and the doctor said they can't get well yet something within them tell am there going to be well hold on no matter what takes place have you join the churches of the denominational world after you have set all your strength from walking from place to place and you still can't find relief there's still a God that answers prayer and saves from sin amen and as we can see am those weary nights back bleeding climbing up the steps again until two and three o00 in the morning praying and seemed like he's just talking to the wind down in his Jewish heart there burned of faith that no Winds of Doubt could ever blow out that's the kind of man and women we need to rise on the scene today if he doesn't answer tonight he will tomorrow night if he doesn't answer this year he will next year for he's a God not a God but the God Amen and we see night after night as amran climbed the steps and jeos would come up to him and say amram dear you've been up here praying all night why don't you just tell some of the boys where you're working and let them pray a while well honey what if they don't do it somebody's got to do it somebody's got to pray through amen that's the way every Christian ought to feel tonight not waiting for somebody else but take the front ourselves and go through if we believe the Bible to be a history it's also a prophetic book that tells that that same God shall rise in the last days and it's time for him to come on scene that's what amram know that Moses had prophesied or not Moses pardon me Abraham had been given a promise by this God of History who hadn't answered a prayer in 400 years as far as we have record but he made a promise that he would bring them out and seemingly we've had a silent God for a long time but the hour has come where he's going to rise on the scene one night one amram had prayed maybe for several years and his hair now was turning GR praying no Deliverance but just getting worse one night he got right down to business that's how we have to do it get right down to business he said God you promise this and we've look forward to it and we see the signs all year and the time is at hand it's time for you to do something about it while he was in deep concentrated prayer praying with all of his heart he looks stand in the corner he rubbed his eyes and looked again there stood an angel with a sword drawn he said Deliverance is coming and you're going to bring a son into the world and he's going to be the one to deliver him see God always answers prayer doesn't he if we just hold on Moses when he had led the children of Israel Faithfully Into the Wilderness and he came to the Red Sea and the mountains on one side and the deserts on the other and Pharaoh's Army this away and the Red Sea in ahead of them and they were trapped in a little nck seemed like it even nature would cry out what's going to happen they're finished Pharaoh's Army by the tens of thousands to ride them down but what did the people begin to murmur and complain or have been better if we'd stayed back in our place where we were at but there was one among those people who had the flame of God's faith burning in his heart who believe that the historical God could rise on the scene in any kind of a difficulty Moses stood with his hands up to God and prayed until a god of History rose on the scene to be a God in present day and he opened up the way and Israel went through the waters on dry land Bo it was not long after that until Joshua had led the same group are their children to the jarden and it was in the month of April when the whole streams are swelling and the Jordan was five times its size look like any good military leader would have brought him there different from that in is that that very time when there wasn't a possibility to cross it but Joshua he remember there was a god of History 40 years before that opened the Red Sea and he called on that God that God came down in great power and become a God in present crisis and open the Jordan and cross them over was many years later when our text reading tonight or subject reading when Elijah had seen the curse of that nation and was up on the mountain and for hundreds of years there had been no prayer answered in Israel yet Elisha knew that there was a god of history that could come on the scene and he challenged the unbelieving world to stand in the presence of this God and see which one would answer by fire The God Who Could protect the Hebrew children from the fiery furnace brought down far and consumed the sacrifice it was also not long after that when a man had died by the name of Lazarus and there was a God that still lived that could take e home without even seeing death and take Elijah up on a CH a fire and he was called on the scene in the dark hour of death and he acted just the way he would at any time yet he was a god of history but was raised up from history to a present crisis down by the Jericho gate or a blind man set by the road crying all hopes is gone no doctors could do him any good his money was spent there was nothing nothing left for him but to sit there and dream for a few days till death would be a sweet relief one day coming down the road a god of History come on the scene in a present crisis God opened the eyes of the blind is in ji's house where the doctors had failed and turned the little girl back to the to be to die and death had come in and taken its bitter toll and taken the only child of the home the little girl of 12 and stretched her out on a couch when a brokenhearted little preacher had to forsake his denomination and all of his friends but he remembered that there was a god of History who could raise it there amen and he went to find him seek and ye shall find knock and it'll be open unto you as and it shall be given unto you he still the same God when this God dwelling in a body called Jesus the son of God when he was called on the scene called up out of History The God Who Could raise the dead in the Old Testament bring life back to a dead baby through a prophet but God cannot die he's God for eternity that baby laying down on the bed stretched out and little Jas knowing that the shunamite got her baby back he said that God of History if he could ever be called into action he's the same God today amen and searching through he had heard some man that's claimed to have the power and that was Jesus of Nazareth who they all hated but he called him on the scene for he's the closest representative he could find of God at the today the god of the Living God and when he was called on the scene and the historical God was called up he acted the same way he did when he spoke to Elijah on that dead baby let me more say today my brother sister in this present day when crisis and when cancer is eatting the world up and diseases of all kind the same historical God the cleanse the leper heal the sick and raise the dead is the same God today he's waiting an for his people to call him on the scene of action one who could forgive a heart for committing adultery seven times in a day he who could cleanse the B Sinner and make them white as a Lily that same God of History lives today to clean out blacken heart of sin and unbelief Hallelujah there was a man had a bar with epilepsy one day and he talking to the church and the was danced and hollered around him for a while and could do no good but there was still a god of history that lived he was determined to find him see me coming off the mountain he run to him and said Lord have mercy on me a devil stuck my child and he Pines away and falls into the fire Jesus said I can if you believe if you believe what if you believe that the god of History still lives today and he was called on the scene and the epilepsy left the child that same God lives today when the churches is failed when politics has failed when everything else is failed and man has failed and everything fail God can't fail he's a God of this old blackb Bible his promise is just as true as he ever was and it's time that his people called on him raised him up from history Hallelujah for it is written Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he's a historical God and he's a present time God and in the last days he said I'll pour out of my spirit upon All Flesh and signs and wonders shall follow them that believe for in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues if they take up serpents or drink deadly things it would not harm them and if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover that was a historical God that give the promise and we're the people today of his pasture hallelujah we're the Sheep of his F and he's waiting on us to stand and call him on the action call him on the scene watch him go into movements watch him do the Supreme watch him do the that man will wonder and scratch your heads and not understand it he's a historical God and a present day God hallelujah he's waiting to be called out of History let's not look at him what good does a historical God do us if he's only a historical God what good would a historical God done amram and Joseph

him with your lips he doesn't come by lip service he comes by faith on your faith not your long prayer you're burning out but he comes with that little dim Faith that's way down in your soul that can take a hold and say that little thing that's been that brought me to this Tabernacle tonight can light my soul opes send me away from here burning and singing like the birds of the air why he's a historical God and a present day God he's waiting need to be called on call upon the Lord he'll hear you speak to him in song pray to him and believe him he'll answer these words I say in closing that's the reason of this meeting tonight that's the reason this meeting is started I believe that the God have told me 27 years ago when we put this Foundation ston H that I preach gospel around the world he brought it to pass when they laughed and said where are you going bil with your seventh grade education I I'm going in the name of the Lord Jesus I preached my sermon before leaving 11 years ago across this pull pit Mr Gertie sitting there sing that only believe and the great giant stood y like I preached on David Ang gol there was science in the great KN world to condemn Divine Healing and put it to shame and everyone tell me boy you'll crack up out there they'll throw you in jail they'll do this that or the other but the god of History had come on the scene and told me to do it and I did it by his grace and his Mercy that same God that was history of 10 years ago has raised on the scene again again amen just as sure as he brought that to pass he shall bring this to pass he's a god of history and he's got a present day he never Slumbers or sleeps he cannot die for he has no beginning or no end Hallelujah in your case tonight sin France that little tickman feeling around your heart that tells you that he is the same that tells you that he can free you from every burden and every crime every sin that you committed against him what can you put your hopes in not even in your own home not in your wife not in your family mother or father my hopes is built on nothing less than Jesus blood with righteousness All Around My Soul gives way then he's All My Hope and stay on Christ that Solid Rock we stand all other grounds is singing s Church friend whatever it is all coming to an end but he lives forever because he lives we live with him what would you give in exchange what could you give what if God calls you tonight to answer the Judgment what would you do about it you put your hopes in the nation it's breaking like all others put your hopes in a certain election is coming on then man I have nothing against them but they're Marling going to leave you can't put your hopes in nothing at all that's going to hold but the god of History who promised it rise and some blessed they they may take you y and pour the dirt on top of you The Undertaker but the upt taker will come around one of these days The Undertaker take you down but the upt taker will take you up just ass sure for those who are dead in Christ will God bring with him when he comes or he's a god of history now to many but he'll be a god of present day when you accept him as your savior and find him real to your heart there'll be something in you that tells you you might not be emotional you might not cry you might not speak with tongues you might not run you might not shout but something will happen that you will know that you'll know that something's taking place your life will tally right with that as long as you live and when the last hour comes and you leave this world you won't fear no evil for thou art with me thy Rob and my staff they'll comfort me when the doctor has turned you down and walked away and the cold veins has come up like Mr ver the other night our
