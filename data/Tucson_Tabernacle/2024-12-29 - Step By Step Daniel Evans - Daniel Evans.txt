traveling today with her family would like prayer for traveling mercies that God will surround her with uh his angels to keep her safe on the road and to bring her back safely Grant him a good time together as a family request here for brother uh Heath Richard please pray for my friend Heath Richard he is in the hospital with flu like symptoms and possible serious heart problems our brother Paul Murray has put a request in for his wife Adriana she's requesting prayer for her back she had several steroid injections that are helping and hurting at the same time a little update on the request from sister Stephanie Peterman put in for Khloe O'Hara it's stating that um the fingers don't look good the surgeon has basically prepare has been preparing her for the worst I'm not sharing this information with chloee I want to keep her spirits High her hopes high and I want to keep everyone believing and praying and standing firm in faith for a miracle her fingers did not decline since yesterday they have remained the same her so her tissues are still fighting please continue praying for circulation and specifically for the cells and tissue to respond to the oxygen that they are getting because that is the problem they only need to respond to only 1% of oxygen to survive and thrive we love you all and I've been reading Chloe all the prayers and scriptures that people are sending thank you so much for all the support for our sweet girl to God be the glory in all this do you have a prayer request that you'd like to make known with an uplifted hand the Lord sees it amen and there's no request too small or too great for the Lord to handle so let's approach the Lord Heavenly Father once again it's it's such a blessing to be in your house Lord we invite you into our midst come be with us Lord would you move up and down the aisles and as you do Lord would each one be able to reach out and just touch the hym of your garment these requests that have been me Tre M known to your we'd ask Lord that you'd undertake Lord if it's just a matter of healing the back for Brother Paul's wife traveling ncies Lord or just to move allow the oxygen to reach the fingers that they might be saved even heart issues Lord are nothing for you Lord move we commit these requests into your hands Lord we have faith and believe that you're more than evil so we commit them into your your hands once again and give you thanks praise and glory for the accomplished work and Lord as we would prepare to take the offering we'd ask that you'd bless it bless the giver use it for your honor and Glory we ask ask in Jesus Christ's name amen you can all have your seats how many remember the story not the story but the testimony brother green told about the uh the child with club [Music] feet how many remember that if you're visiting or if you don't know it as I remember him telling the story he was watching while brother brandham was praying for a child who didn't have any feet I think it was didn't have any feet just stubs at the bottom of his legs and brother green had his head bowed but he was looking like this and brother Brenham dropped the child in the middle of the prayer and God created two feet in front of brother Green's eyes I believe that with all my heart and for this prayer request for the I mean God created two feet out of nowhere and this this little girl who has the problem with her hands God gave her those hands God is more than able to heal and then for brother Heath too with the with the with the sickness and with issues with his heart I know he's battled with his back too the Lord's more than able can we just let our faith rise on behalf of those requests this morning and just believe that the Lord's got it under control he's going

David I appreciate you being here this morning um it's a last our last service of the year and it's been uh It's Been a Good Year it's I know that change is difficult but change is necessary for Success brothers and sisters it is that's way whenever you see something that's successful whether it be in the ministry or whether it be in business it always has a component of drastic change that's when Jesus was here when Jesus showed up he was very successful and it was because he changed everything he kept the word the foundation but he made sweeping changes that's how every reformer that's how every church that makes a change that's how every successful businessman you have to be able to change and it's I know it's difficult but it's part of it and uh we've had a lot of changes this year we we um have a new flooring in the fellowship hall we have new flooring in the um in the low room for the kids we have a new Fellowship Hall uh we have a new Courtyard we have there there's been a lot that's been done this year and I'm thankful for it and really it's just kind of revv me up because I want to do more I think that once and we're we're pretty much finished in there we got to get our countertops in and then we're going to move into the sanctuary and these places they're for a purpose they're not just to look at when we when we make changes and we upgrade things and we bring new things in that is to help the congregation to to make it easier for us to make it easier for us to do God's Will and it's a blessing and one of the things I announced the other day I'm very very much looking forward to adding to to presenting to the church and adding to men of God to our uh board our our church board these are two brothers that have worked tirelessly on the fellowship hall worked tirelessly on the grounds and done just a whole lot of work over the past year and I think that they are going to make great additions to our trustee board that's brother John loer here and brother Dan numer we all all know them and know both of them and ask the church to pray about electing these two brothers as trustees when we have our election and we'll have it next month have it sometime in January it won't be the first week because I'm not ready quite yet with the bylaws there were some bylaws that the lawyer some bylaws changes that the lawyer suggested and I'm just I'm still going through them I'm still praying about a couple of them they they're very small and you probably wouldn't notice them but I just want to make sure they're right and I want to make sure that that my changes are right and then I will also bring those changes before you all as The Sovereign body that has authority over all of these things pray about these things remember you have a vote and and you want to vote according to the will of God you have an individual walk with him and ask the Lord Lord how do do you want me to vote on these brothers how do you want me to vote on these bylaw changes we've this past year we've elected a complete board we have deacons who I believe are men of God brother Jordan brother Aaron Brother Lyle everyone every one of these three brothers has the gift that's in their life to rightly divide the word all three of them have a wonderful understanding of of the word of of God of the Bible and and how it can be applied to to our lives and to help the congregation and and they're they're here every single service which is a requirement for a deacon you got to be here you're you're a policeman in the church you're taking care of the church and I'm so just so appreciative of these three brothers and we have two trustees who have done I can't tell you how much that these brothers have done brother Ed dogall and and all of the he's he has run the construction projects He has been the point man for all of the all of those things and then brother um Arie Peterson is always here he's always fixing something he's always taking care of the church and just what a blessing brothers and sisters that we all have to have these brothers and their wives when God calls a man he calls his wife and their wives work just as hard as they do on all of these things so sister an you're responsible too but I just I appreciate let's give our board a hand if we [Applause] could I so and we've added a a wonderful tremendously talented worship team we have brother Josiah sister Katie um Daniel and Lily and and and Martha and Michael and and sister Jessica and sister hope and and and all of our worship team is just tremendous and they have just been they've been such an incredible blessing and they do such a great job all of that has come about in this year we've added to our our team of of sound people and they do a great job they're the ones that put the quotes up and puts puts the scriptures up and puts the words up for the songs and and brother Jordan runs that team I see brother Tim back there brother Jeremy brother and the the the young numer ladies and sister um Rachel you do such a wonderful job people work and they do it because they serve us because they love us and I I'm just so I'm so thankful in this past year I felt really led to Let's dig deep into the Bible and we have gone through every book in the Old Testament this past year from Genesis all the way through Malachi studying and learning and I really believe that that it's building a foundation for us as all of the things that we're doing are building a foundation the first year or half a year that I was here I really wanted to build Unity I wanted the church to get to know each other we had we had a we had camps we had um preached a lot on the book of Acts I really hit legalism hard I I I stood against it because I believe that it it causes harm I I I stood strong on that and plus I wanted you to know what kind of a pastor you were getting so when I first started the first six months I was here in a trial role I really hit it hard and then you'll notice I backed off and and just started just preaching the word the best the best that I knew how and then this past year I believe the Lord has really started to build a foundation in us that we are learning with Knowledge Learning what this book is about building a foundation for a work that is to come for a work that we can do and we have the the facility the the building is getting so much better we we we're more efficient over in the fellowship all I want to start using it I want it to be used for the ministry 2025 2024 I believe was a preparation for 2025 and 2025 I want it to be a Outreach Ministry I want us to hit this hard let's let's everyone do something and use this these things that we've built whether it be our knowledge in the word whether it be the church whether it be the upper rooms or the lower rooms or whatever it might be we're going to have Harmony in 2025 we're going to be doing doing more I want to have more dinners over in the fellowship hall now that we have it building Unity here and and bringing people in and we start brothers and sisters Outreach in the traditional sense is is a is a difficult thing it's usually not very successful but Outreach to our families Outreach to our friends Outreach to to our neighbors there is where we find success it's very hard to go to a stranger and witness to that stranger because that stranger is going to say who are you but when you build someone's trust or when you have someone's trust that is where success is built and we need to have a place that we can come together and serve the people and that is what this church is for I already started talking to my neph the other day of Christmas he wants to have a Bible study so I'm going to open up my house to some of the youth and these aren't youth from this church this is my nephew who who's not never been I don't think he's ever even been here but his friends have questions on their hearts these are kids that are 18 19 years old I'm going to open we're going to open our house for them and bring them in and let's let's start studying let's dig into this word what questions do you have and this past year all of us if you've been here if you've made the made the commitment to come on Wednesday night you have learned you may not think that you have but you have you've learned what this Bible is about you've learned that that these prophets have come and they've preached these messages and these messages many times they came at the same time they came when when God was fixing to move they came in the in the in the the Babylonian captivity much of the Old Testament was written around there they came when when Samuel was here and and the people were just having all kinds of problems in the Book of Judges and idolatry had entered in they came the um the the prophets came when Abraham who who laid the foundation when God was moving and that's I believe that God is going to move in 2025 and I want to do everything that I can that he might use this vessel to do his will to win souls to his kingdom and I want this church every single one of us has a role in this you may think you don't but you do and there is no role that is more important than any other role and I want to encourage the church to step to the plate in 2025 we did well in 2024 now we have laid a foundation found now let's build on that foundation and let's start working let's get to work let's get these let's get this job done let's finish it we always think well I'm just waiting on the lord it's a nice thing to say maybe the Lord's waiting on us maybe he's been waiting for 2,000 years on someone that would really believe his word and someone that will put it to work and we'll get it done it's coming I think the time is right so let's take our little group of 150 or 200 people that we have at the Tucson Tabernacle and let's let's accomplish what L the Lord has for us to do and how do we do it we follow this blueprint right here Psalm 119 it says that the word is a lamp to our feet it's what lights the path and and a a a lamp to our feet you only know the next step or the next couple steps and you just walk in this light and you stay on the path step by step we go through this life and step by step we need to be getting closer to God brothers and sisters listen to me every day should be be a step closer to God and if you haven't gotten any closer to the Lord in this past year or in the past five years or in the past 10 years then there is something wrong there's not something there's nothing something wrong with God there's something wrong with us step by step we go back to the Book of Joshua and the prophet Moses had died God made all of these promises to His prophets from Abraham all the way to Moses and he said that you are going to go over into this Promised Land And now when Joshua was there the prophet passed away and it was time to go over and realize the promises that were given this book of Joshua brothers and sisters I believe it is as applic able for today as any other book in the Bible it is time to go over and we all have a part to play and you'll see when we get into Joshua today every person had an equal part start with Joshua chter 1 verse one and I'll read some of the scriptures here says this now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses's min Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise and go over this Jordan thou and all this people un the land which God which I do give them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that I that I have given unto you as I said unto Moses Moses the Lord is quoting in Deuteronomy 11 that he told Moses the same thing that every step that you take that I have given this to you we we put it in today's terms maybe and we say it and and there's there's been a lot of a prayer request this morning Lord I got another day of pain I'm sick but by the grace of God I took ground from the enemy I took another step in my life I got through another day and other people say Lord I want an extra hour maybe without a cigarette I made I I took some ground or you could say maybe I skipped if you're trying to to lose some weight maybe I skipped that that snack before bed Lord I I I took a step maybe I didn't contribute to the gossip when I had a chance maybe I spent an hour or less on my phone today than I did yesterday maybe my husband and I and I didn't get on a fight today my wife and I didn't argue today we took some ground and that ground that we took it was given to me now don't go back keep going forward don't backslide and if you do backside get back up and start taking ground again because God gave it to you he gave it to me and he gave it to Joshua he said every place that the sole of your feet steps is yours and that's how we are I I I I'm not what I want to be as brother Bram talked about the the the sister in the South I'm not what I want to be and I'm not what I ought to be but I'm not what I used to be I've taken some ground let's take more ground this year and when you make progress don't go back stand strong whether it's sickness whether it's it's an addiction whatever it is even if it's one minute Less on the little square Idol even if it's one less cigarette in the day whatever it might be even if it's just one less that's still ground that you've taken from the enemy it's still ground that you that is is yours now take it and then take another step step by step we can get through this this battle verse number four from the Wilderness in this Lebanon even unto the Great River the river of Euphrates and all the land of the Hittites and under the great sea toward the Goring down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake Thee I know he was talking to Joshua but I'm claiming that scripture for myself be strong and of good courage For unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto the F unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous not just courageous be very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper wherever thou goest don't turn from the word of God Moses wrote those first five books of the Bible and he's God is telling Joshua here don't turn from what you have heard stay with it and with those words you will prosper this book of of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success this was more important he's talking to Joshua who was about to go to battle and he's saying this is more he didn't say anything about you train your soldiers make sure that they have this sord or that sword make sure that their their Shields are strong enough he's saying don't forget the word he's saying and let it be in your mouth all the time let you be talking about it all the time it's more important than your education it's more important than your training let it be constantly constantly coming out of you meditating on it day and night all the time then you shall make your way prosperous let me read that again this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou you will make your way prosperous you have a choice here it's up to you you can put the Lord first you can put his word first you can do according to his word and you can prosper God's leaving it up to you he's leaving it up to me and then you will have good success have not I commanded thee be strong and of good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whether soever thou goest so the Lord gives instructions to Joshua he sends spies we know the story over into Jericho the there they are they're on the other side of this River and this river is not a creek brother L is not like the Jordan River in the summer the river was rushing it it was over its banks it was a time of a flood and here comes all of these people hundreds of thousands if not millions of people come up to this water and Joshua sends out spies and they see out in the distance there is this great City that called Jericho that has these giant walls around it and God wanted them to go take that City why did he want them to take that City there was a predestinated seat in there there was a soul inside that City and Saul was a a prostitute and Saul was a what we would call a nasty woman but there was a soul there in her family he sends out the spies the spies go out they look around they come back they said we're more than able to do it he says they're afraid they they say they're afraid of us let's go Joshua we can do it this year let's improve let's do more he says we can do it remember in kades barnia years earlier they went out and they're like oh they're too big they're too strong God's like but I'm with you that generation died out they had to die out Joshua chapter 3:1 and Joshua Rose early in the morning and they removed from sham and they came to Jordan he and all the children of Israel and they lodged there before they passed over and it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the host and they commanded the people saying when you see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God and the priests and the Levites bearing it then you shall remove from your place and go after it yet there shall be a space between you in it about 2,000 cubits by measure come not near unto it that you may know the way by which you must go for you have not passed this way hither hither for you haven't come this way before and here we are again approaching this watch that Arc he said stand back so you can have a good look at it so you know where it's at all the time watch that Ark because you haven't come this way before keep your eye our Ark today is the word of God keep your eye on the word all the time don't let it ever depart from you always watch it and Joshua said unto the people sanctify your eles for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you saying get rid of your sin if you want to see God do something special get rid of your habits if you want to see God do something special Jesus said one time it was the most beautiful things he said everything that he said was beautiful but he said Lord he said father I sanctify myself for their sake what a statement Jesus Christ himself said Lord I am making myself pure because I care about them and if we have the same Spirit of Christ in US brothers and sisters should we not make ourselves pure should we not live a life above reproach not for oursel oh I'm afraid of going to hell no I want this person to be saved I want this person to be healed I want my son I want my daughter I want my friends I want my family I want them Lord I'm going to sanctify myself so you'll hear my prayers for them he tells the priests there was that great river of Jordan there swelled up he he tells the priests he says you take pick up the Ark of the Covenant he said walk up to the riv River listen to this and he says walk into the river they had to have faith walk out into it and watch what'll happen so the priests go out they're carrying the ark and he says once you do that then the wa the water will stop flowing skip to verse 15 and as as they that bear the ark were come un Jordan and the feet of the priests that be the ark were dipped in the brim of the water for Jordan overfloweth all it Bank all its all his Banks all the time of the Harvest that the waters which came down from from above stood and Rose up a a heap very far from the city of Adam that is beside of zaratan and those that came down to toward the Sea of the plain even the salt sea failed and were cut off and the people passed over right against Jericho and the priests that bare the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan and the Israelites passed over on dry ground until all the people were passed clean over Jordan They Carried this Ark and they it just struck me they got their feet wet they walked in there they had faith that God was going to do this and here they go they go right into there and then they get in the middle of it and the water dries up and they're holding the ark and here comes everybody walking by them yeah we're going and there's these priests and they're holding the ark and the people are walking by and then Joshua says oh go back there where that Ark is 12 strong men one from each tribe and go grab one of those big rocks that are in the middle of the Jordan in the middle of the flood go grab one and pick it up and put it on your shoulder and go lay it over here and then when this pile is here for generations to come you bring people back to this pile of rocks and when you're children say what about those pile what about these rocks you tell them this story of when Israel walked over walked through that Jordan on dry land beautiful story then they get over to this place called gilgal and one of the most amazing things they had lost their Heritage these people W wandering in the wilderness they had forgotten remember all the fighting going on and the wandering in the wilderness and the complaining with Moses and all of that they had forgotten who they were and Joshua God tells Joshua he says circumcise the people remember the Covenant with Abraham of circumcision these people that had come over Jordan were not circumcised they had forgotten they were sons of Abraham a friend of God they have forgotten their Heritage none of them were circumcised so Joshua tells them he says now be circumcised you are sons of Abraham you are the heritage of God you've forgotten who you are remember now so they were circumcised according to God's Will and it amazes me Jewish people had forgotten that commandment all of them but it was a took a new generation to come over and that old complaining generation the Bible calls him Fighters they were always arguing with each other and fighting and and and and and just messing everything up they all died out then they came over and Joshua said I'm going to remind you who you are I'm G to remind you who your father Abraham is and they were circumcised let's go to um Joshua 6 verse 10 and Joshua had commanded the people saying you shall not shout so remember God he told the people he says here's what we're going to do we're going to God commanded Joshua Joshua told the people we are going to walk up to this city Jericho now now that we're across and God has done this great miracle we're going to go up to these walls or close to them and God commanded that you're going to walk around the wall once a day for six days and then on the seventh day you're gonna walk around it seven times then you're gonna blow the trumpet you're going to shout and the walls are going to come tumbling down now listen to these instructions verse number 10 and Joshua had commanded the people saying ye shall not shout nor make any noise with your voice neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I bid you shout then you shall you shout so the priest carried their horn the men carried their their their instruments of war and you got to think that old that little Rahab she's like well they'll told me they were coming and here they are walking around and nobody's making a peep they're all quiet and they're walking around walking around the walls what is going on here brothers and sisters if one person one woman one man would have said one word it would have all failed here they are going around Joshua says not one of you shall say one word the walls would have stood firm if somebody would just said something on the third day the second day Rahab would have continued her prostitution inside the walls it would have all been a failure if everyone one was not obedient there was a requirement that every single person followed these Commandments we know that that's the case of one person because after they they conquered the City Jericho one man disobeyed God his name was aen just one man and then it caused them to lose the next battle and it caused many to die they were obedient here he said he commanded don't say a word until I call for it he commanded March around this imagine today there's a greater than Joshua his name is Jesus Christ had the same name Yeshua it's the same word as same name as Joshua in the Old Testament imagine today Jesus Commandments repent of your sins imagine if one person person doesn't do it one person would have ruined the whole program of God with Joshua love one another pray for your enemies forgive those who sin against you make disciples of Jesus Christ tell the world about Christ let your light so shine before men one person if one person didn't do it in Joshua's time do you think that if one person doesn't now doesn't do it now that it'll be any different how great are our Stakes how important are our lives you think anybody's any more important than anyone else aen was no nobody even knew who aen was oh he's like oh he's the son of the son of the son of and then oh he's in this tribe oh yeah we we track down who aan is he was a nobody but he was very very important and all of us how important is is our ministry how's how important is our lives we can hinder the whole work any of us can Jesus commanded repent he commanded love one another he commanded pray for your enemies forgive those who sin against you make disciples of Jesus Christ he commanded those things and what if we're not doing it it messes up the whole program six days they walked around the city as the Lord has instructed and on the seventh day they marched around the city seven times not a word that is amazing to me people didn't talk the whole time but they didn't they shouted that they blew the horns the walls came down the battle was won Rahab and her family were saved I am taken back by that story and there is a greater than Joshua these gospels give us specific Commandments and how much will I hurt you if I don't follow them and how much will you hurt me and how much will we hurt each each other if we are not doing these things God's people should be operating in unity always keeping an eye on the word always always watching that Arc going before us and when the Battle of Jericho was won the Battle of between us and Satan is going to be won in the same manner it's going to be one through discipline it's going to be one through dedication to the world word 1 Corinthians chapter 12 we talk about how important it was that every person was on the same page with Joshua now let's look in this modern day let's start with verse four 1 Corinthians uh 12:4 it says this now there are diversities of gifts but the Same Spirit I'm going to read the new King James it's really close but there's a couple words that mean a little a little different today than they did back then um verse number verse number four there are diversity of gifts but the Same Spirit verse number five there are differences of Ministries but the same lord and there are diversities of activities but the same God who works all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to each one for the profit of all so every person has a role and no role is more important than any other for to one is given by the spirit of of the word wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another Gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of expence to another diverse kinds of tongues and to another interpretation of tongues but all these worketh that one and self-same spirit dividing every man severly as as he will dividing every man individually as God will for the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ he is one and his body is one for by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body whether it be Jews or Gentiles whether we Bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit for the the body is not one member but many you might admit that you're part of the body but you might not think that you're as important as other members the body of Christ is one whole unit and it is perfect it is perfect so you can't say that this member is more important than this member all of us have an equal role go back to Joshua what if they would have spoken like achen achen took a wedge of gold and a garment what if one member does that it ruins the whole thing it ruins the whole body every one of us has a gift to bring into the church and what the enemy does is the enemy tries to take that gift out of the church all of us have a gift and all of us are important and what the enemy does is he tries to tell you no you just sit back and do nothing just sit back and wait for the Lord to do something when in reality the Lord is waiting for you to do something and you know what's going to happen nothing we are those gifts that God places in the church look around you're surrounded by them and when they're doing nothing nothing is being done and as the Bible says here as the Apostle Paul is saying one's not important more important than the other one as we go into this 2025 we have to be acting in our role I don't care if you're hundred years old I don't care if you're 12 years old you have to be in your place verse number 18 but now hath God set in the members every one of them in the body as it have pleased him you're not placed in the body by the pastor you're not placed in the body by a deacon you're not placed in the body by a prophet you're not placed in the body by any of these things God has placed you here every one of us and he's given us a gift that is to be shared not to lift ourselves up brothers and sisters that's where many fail not to promote your own Ministry but to promote God and to be a help to the people that God has placed us here to serve verse number 27 now you are the body of Christ okay I think that's pretty plain who are you talking about Paul now ye are the body of Christ and individually members in particular new King James says now you are the body of Christ and members individually and God has set some in the church first apostles secondary prophets thirdly teachers after that Miracles then Gifts of healing helps governments diversities of tongues notice that Ephesians 4 it says a five-fold Ministry Apostles and Prophets and evangelists and pastors and teachers here there's only three of them Apostles prophets and teachers it's showing that God is not trying to put us all in a box he's speaking on these are guiding principles brothers and sisters these are gifts that God places into the church and you don't have to fit into any role God has made you perfect for the work that you are to accomplish that is the point in all this we have to accomplish what God wants us to accomplish and he says here he's like he says okay you have you have these three preaches here but then you have after that Miracles Gifts of healing helps brother Jordan so eloquently says many times he's he he places himself right there and he says says I'm here to help he says I want to be that that one that helps people and he does I don't think there's many that can say that they do more for all of us than Jordan Peterson diversities of tongues diversity of tongues we always think of standing up and giving a prophecy in tongues that could mean helping with translation David it could mean using the gift that you have of being able to speak two languages and being able to apply that to the ministry it's whatever the Lord has placed you and he's not trying to fit us all in a single box are all Apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of Miracles have all gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet I will show unto you a more excellent way he's placing these gifts into the church and he's saying that these are for your your benefit these are gifts that I placed there they're to help you and here's how that they are distributed though I speak with tongues of men and angels and have not charity which is love and become a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol and though I have the gift of Prophecy and to understand all the Mysteries and all the knowledge this is this is just keep going this was right after chapter 12 this is chapter 13 and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all the Mysteries and all the knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing you could be the most gifted guy in the world and you are nothing without love and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing all of brother Lono all of these things all of of these gifts that were given they are given in love if you come up to be prayed for we lay our hands on you and it's not done in love it's not right you enter into the S same suffering of that person if you're praying for your your son or your daughter or your brother or your sister and you're not doing it because you truly love that person you just want this person to be like you it doesn't it's of none effect but when that love of God really enters into the equation is when things really happen we can close the musicians can come let's go back to the Book of Joshua as we close the very end of the book they had gone through and they they they had had many successes they had had many failures they had conquered all the land and they were still fighting and Joshua was an old man and was ready for Joshua's time to leave Joshua brings the leaders together and he's giving his closing statements he's giving the end of his ministry and he wants the people to stand strong on what they've learned Joshua 24:14 says this now therefore fear the lord this is it this is the end of Joshua these are his closing statements now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood remember when they walked across Jordan put away those gods that they served put away that nonsense that they had put away that fighting that that they con were were bickering and arguing and doing all those things put that stuff away and in Egypt and and and serve the Lord and if it seem evil to you to serve the Lord another translation says if it seems undesirable to you to serve the Lord choose this day whom you will serve whether the gods with your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but as for me in my house we will serve the Lord everybody quotes that that Ser that that scripture but do you know what it means choose this day whom you will serve you're going to serve somebody you're going to serve some God and he's saying now you choose you say you don't want to be a Christian you don't want to do this well choose who are you going to serve you going to serve the God of this world you going to serve your you're going to serve yourself you're going to serve sin he's saying you're going to serve something now you choose who you going to who you going to serve and then he says but as far as me and my house will serve God it's so easy to quote it but are we going to make that decision to truly serve God I go back to the commandments of Jesus are you truly going to pray for those that hate you are you truly going to surrender your desires Surrender Your lusts Surrender your life and make your body a Living Sacrifice to God are you truly going to do that are you truly going to go out and make disciples to Jesus Christ are we going to do that are you going to serve your career are you going to serve your school are you going to serve your friends are you going to serve your lusts what are you going to serve Joshua says choose this day you're going to serve somebody so now choose what are you going to do you going to make a change in 2025 you're going to make a change right now I want a change in my life I want to be more more more dedicated to him I want to do more for him I want to pray more I want to read my Bible more I am not I am falling short Lord I'm not living up to this I want to be different I want to I want to go to battle I want to watch that Ark and I want to follow it everywhere it goes and not take my my eyes off of it when when the when the word says don't say a word I don't want to say a word when the word says speak I want to speak when the word says forgive I want to forgive I want to live for God I want to change in my life I want it different and then we can go along we can go over Jordan or anything else we can go out all the way into heaven but we need a change step by step and it doesn't all just happen at once you make a commitment if I'm going to lose 20 pounds it ain't going to happen today but it can start today if I'm going to start reading my Bible if I'm going to dedicate an hour an hour a day to the Lord it starts today and then I'll make another step that'll be tomorrow and then I'll make another step and then step by step we will get through this life and every step that we take God has given to us and once you take some ground from the enemy hold it say no I took this Satan God has worked through me and given me the power to do it I'm holding on to it I'm not going back and if you go back get up pull that sword and and keep going forward stay with it for a set a goal just this week make steps just this week and then you'll see that next week will be easier and then the next week will be easier it might be studying it might be your grades might be prayer it should be prayer might be reading your Bible more might be doing something for someone else it might be helping out at the church it might be it could be anything but you have to do it I cannot stand when somebody is always just talking about it and nothing ever happens and that's the world today just talk about it talk about it talk about it but Joshua was like let's go come on let's go men women [Music] children listen to this expectation 1954 and that thing is perhaps being done around the world tonight among Faithfully believing members of the body of Jesus Christ and Divine Healing doesn't lay within me and each of these Brethren sitting here your pastor you don't have to wait till they have a Divine Healing program to be healed every one of these men has got just the same Authority that I or any anyone else has got to pray for the sick is that message or is that not message and that's all we can do is pray for the sick and not only them but if they're off somewhere and can't get to you that good Holy Ghost filled sister or brother that lives next door to you has the same Authority that's right same thing if you can't get your pastor the Bible says if any sick among you call upon the Elders of the church and let them anoint with oil and pray over the sick the prayer of faith shall save the sick we just we're going through James right now he quoting James God shall raise them up not the minister God shall raise them up and if they did any sin it shall be forgiven them confess your faults one to another and pray one for another is that right one another be prayed for that you may be healed for the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man aail of months again from James that's all you need be filled with God's spirit and you'd be surprised if you only knew the gifts that's setting right in this building [Music] tonight I say the same if we just knew the gifts that were in just this building every person here is a gift and God has bestowed on every person a gift and if we just knew what was in this room what difference could we make what could we do for God if we would just realize that gift and be willing to follow the will of God willing to follow the word of God next quote says this and now we see in the Bible that Jesus Christ the son of God when he came to the Earth he came to rid sin and sickness divorce it put it away forever from from his people oh wow he came to rid sin and sickness and divorce it and put it away forever from his people and he claimed that he would return again but in his absence he gave his church the same Authority that he had think about this I'm going to ask you a question and I want you to raise your hand if you believe this he said this but in his absence he gave his church the same Authority that he had who here is part of that church then he gave you the same Authority that he had and that was proven at the day of Pentecost in the book of Acts it was proven and I believe it all the way down to this day [Music] hear ye him Jesus said whatsoever whosoever sends you remit is remitted whatsoever you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven whatsoever you loose on Earth I'll loose in heaven that's the power of God's Church Brethren we're short of that he was crying out this 19 1957 I believe we're more short now than back then Brethren we're short of that we say it was shame face we're short of that because the church has draw divisions and lines and so forth and accepted other things instead of staying with God's love and the Holy Spirit and the Bible God's love puts it first the holy spirit in the Bible I think those three things things pretty much round it all out think they pretty much cover [Music] it 1 Corinthians 15:58 says this therefore my beloved Brethren I love this part of the Bible oh 1 Corinthians 15:58 therefore my beloved Brethren be you steadfast and unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not not in vain in the Lord how encouraging always abounding always doing the works of God and God placed a gift into your life you have no right to hide it you have no right to keep it you have to use it if you want to be in God's will every one of us and we are falling short as brother brandom said we are falling short if we are not using that gift Brothers and sisters this coming year step the Bible um there's a baseball term step to the plate and take a swing if you miss you got three strikes keep swinging if you strike out you got another at back coming step to the plate and start doing it you're going to fail of course you're going to fail but work song work till we'll work till Jesus comes do it work come into the light of the glory of Jesus Christ step into that light and serve your brothers and sisters in this world and those gifts they will make a difference but we all got to be together and every gift that God has given Let It Be manifested sister Irma if it's singing a song sing it sing it for God bless someone else if it's playing a guitar if it's playing bass sister Shirley if it's praying get on your knees and pray what greater gift could you have than be able to talk to God himself being able to talk to Jehovah what greater gift could there be if it's preaching preach if it's healing if it's Miracles live a life so that God can use you and do it and have faith that God has placed this gift in your life one body working together in perfect unity and don't try to separate yourself thinking I'm the special one or my little group is special because you're not Jesus Christ is special and he he has gifts all over I just wish that those gifts would operate in unity and they will one day just say where are [Music] you I know who I am cuz I know who you are the cross of s salvation was only the star now I am [Music] chosen free and [Music] forgi I have a [Music] future and it's worth the living sing it brothers and sisters I know who I am cuz I know who you are Cross of [Music] Salvation was

now we could wander in the wilderness for another 40 years walking around in circles where we can go step by step and take ground from the enemy but you have to choose this day who you're going to serve and it's not a choice you take lightly don't just say well I choose to serve God then show me then stand up then move forward then take step by step take it from the enemy Joshua and the people of Israel every place that they stepped their foot was theirs but they had to fight for every step God doesn't just give it to us he wants us to be men and women he wants us to be mature Servants of God and not weaklings that are just given not spoiled brat kids that just have have everything given to them on he wants us to be strong in his Spirit he wants us to overcome every Church age it says to him that overcomes let's all stand Galatians says let us not become weary in doing good for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we don't give up just [Music] hallelu you called out my name

this morning will you take a step God gave it to you take that step and then it's yours amen let's bow our heads before the almighty God who is watching if there would be one here that would want to take a step in his or her life and draw closer to God and to take Land from the enemy that was rightfully theirs and allow their gift to operate in the body of Christ if there would be one that would be here today that would want to take another step raise your hand before God Heavenly Father you saw the hands raised Lord we pray that we made the effort to raise our hands now Lord give us the
