genuine prophet of God speak to us he's was speaking he spoke this message 1960 on Christmas Day and um as we're listening to brother Brandon preach I want everyone to listen closely listen to his words listen to the way that his voice is and and the emphasis he puts on certain things rather than just reading a minister up here reading a quote you're going to hear it from the original tonight and I want you to make the decision what was brother brand message and I'll tell you this sermon we're going to hear tonight is really no different than almost every sermon that he ever preached they all pretty much had the same theme they all focused on the same thing and there was just he just used different scriptures and different subjects to prove the same point and as you hear this tonight [Music] think about how did he emphasize a big church or in this case did he emphasize a Manger a baby in a Manger did he emphasize a big denomination in an exclusive club or did he emphasize Jesus Christ with open arms to whoever would come in did he emphasize this man Jesus being accepted by all the groups and all the different uh divisions or did he maybe say that they don't want Jesus what they want is their way and they want their churches think about that as you listen to this sermon tonight called God's wrapped gift and you can imagine it was a precious little love gift from God wrapped in these swaddling clothes and laid in a Manger not even a place for the baby to be born not even a a a room a room in the hotel the local Inn but of the poorest of the poor yet that is where Jehovah God himself chose to become flesh and to die to live a life and to die for our sins was this little baby let's sing only believe and then we'll turn the service to brother Brandon [Music] only only be all things are possible ho believe only holy be all things are possible only if you want to follow along on your phone it's 60-1 1225 God's wrapped gift and we we will play the first half of it tonight and then the second half on Wednesday God bless you all you may be seated here's brother Brandon it's always good to come to the house of the Lord but much better seem like in these uh Christmas and New Years and holy days seems like it has a special little blessing left for us and as we it's just too bad we can't have this Christmas feeling all the time people waving at you and saying the Lord bless you that's good I like that one thing about Christmas now I was hearing the watch party given out I believe for next Saturday night the Lord willing I try to be here then if the watch party put in my time if the Lord willing to help them speak a little on uh some subject for next Saturday night and Sunday morning of course is our regular Sunday school and Sunday night as a Evangelistic serviceing next Sunday yeah communion foot washing next Sunday night that's right the good way to start the new year out right take communion have the feet washing now I want to make a announcement that um I'm asking that this is a little little Clos meeting like just to the pastors and Associate pastors of the Tabernacle trustees and deacons of this Tabernacle uh I think it's good for us to get together once in a while and kind of uh find out the way the Lord is leading us and many times there is little things come up like a scriptures that you would uh find that would be hard and if we don't we want the same speak the same thing everywhere and um we want to get together and I want you pastors and Associates of course brother Neville that would be and Brother Don ruddle up here one of our Associates brother Grim Snelling at udica brother Stricker here our missionary and the the Brethren that's uh pastors brother uh the different ones here brother Parnell and you know who the associat are here brother Junior Jackson from down in New Albany and um then uh the deacons and the trustees I tell you what I wish you to do this coming week get you a little slip of paper and write out in there the the thoughts are the I would say to the scriptures are some Duty that you have to tend that you might not know like a trustee would say just what is my duty if this case arises what is my duty as a deacon if this case arises and the pastor might say uh in this word here I see where it was supposed to be so and so and uh I I don't understand it it's the way we teach it and place that down in the scripture and so forth then hand them all into um uh brother wood if you will because he lives next door to me and as soon as you get your root out and as quick as you can I appreciate it so I can be looking it up in the scriptures and we'll have this not it wasn't a public meeting now it's just for the pastors and of this Tabernacle and the deacons and trustees of the Tabernacle and that'll come right away just as soon as we can get them in then we'll announce a night where there's no no meetings going on here and then we'll we'll take care of that then I think it'd be a good thing brother Neen and brother and all you pastors and so forth that we we might come together that way we can speak the same thing everywhere you see we know and then that will be taped also our questions and our answers will be taped and each one may have a tape so that you might know to play back in case of anything any uh question coming up that might be benefit to the church or someone would say well uh this uh we'll go back and see what we on the tape it said we have tapes of that nature already and now we got new trustees I think this year and and some new deacons and so forth and uh we like to get them in instructed on that and this little brother that's one of our Breen from up here at Sellersburg brother um Willard CCE sure get him a message of it if you will because he's just young in the Lord and if these young fellas I think can get established you see what I mean just know how to hold on little questions come up in their mind instead of running off on some limb let's come together and and see what it's all about then when we are meetings our great joint meetings when the churches join together like we've been in this last session then we we would know then just what to take and what to say just what to do we all want to speak the same language so we'll understand now another thing I would like to say as brother Neville has so well said that we wished you the best in the these you Tidings in this time of of Fellowship around these holy days and so forth and then I want to take this time to express to each and every one of you how grateful I am to you for your Christmas cards and gifts and things that was received at our house amen I certainly thank you with all my heart it certainly did us good this morning when I got a little boy small enough yet to kind of want a Christmas tree and we had it in the room and this morning going to there I found several gifts from my church here and my friends from around different places that had come in laying under the tree and I don't have words to express to you what I how I appreciate every one of them and may the god of Heaven bless you richly as my prayer and now and us you know how it would be we cannot send back uh gift because I just wouldn't make that much money you know I I make a $100 a week and I got a big family and about 10 million friends it would sure be kind of hard to go around them but we U we are grateful to you in your thoughts and I'm sure you understand now don't forget the this this coming New Year's night oh I remember the first watch party I ever had here in this Tabernacle I don't guess is anyone here remembers it but that was one night the Lord had took plenty of starch out of your pastor so we're looking forward for a great time then and now just before we pray I would like to read the scripture lesson tonight and I have been kind of debating with myself today I I announced that I was going to speak on tonight if I got here uh we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship him that kind of sound familiar to me and our good friend brother sofman here the one of the trustees of the church I'd asked in him and he said I have the tape of it brother brandom you preached it somewhere and our precious friend brother Leo Mercer here the tape boy said yes about five times so I I changed it just a little bit and instead of preaching on we have seen a star in the east I want to speak on the subject tonight of God's wrapped gift and now I'm going to read from St Matthew's gospel the the uh second chapter for a scripture reading the second chapter of St Matthew now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise man from the East to Jerusalem saying where is he that's born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him when Herod the King heard these things he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all the chief priests and the scribes of the people together he demanded them where Christ should be born and they said unto him in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is written by the prophet and thou Bethlehem in the land of Judea art thou not the least among the prince of Judah for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule My People Israel then Herod when he had privately called the wise men inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when ye have found him bring word again bring me word again that I may come and worship him also when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the East went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and when they were come into the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him when they had opened their treasures and presented unto him Gifts of gold frankincense and Mira and being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod they departed in their own country another way now I want to take a text out of there tonight not from there but out of the same story in St Luke 2:7 and she brought forth brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloth and laid him in the manger because there was no room for them in the end let us bow our heads now for a word of prayer holy and gracious God who gave us the greatest gift that this world has ever known of the Lord Jesus Christ we humbly come to thee tonight in Thanksgiving and expressing from our innermost being the Deep adorations of our heart to thee for this marvelous gift we have nothing to give in return and it was very little that you asked just come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I'll take your burdens and your sins and set you free oh what an exchange no one could do that but thee our father and we thank thee that thou has did that for us and we are thy Witnesses in this hour that you take our bre burdens and sins and give us joy and peace instead how thankful we are for Lord this ENT Christian experience Christmas in our hearts we are so glad for this so happy to know that we're living at the end day when we see the signs coming again like it was in that day of his approach we humble our hearts in thy presence oh great Noble one let thy Spirit reign supremely in our heart in our lives and strengthen Us From the Inside Out amen that we might be Servants of thine in this great and Dark Hour that the world is now facing we present this reading of Thy word Lord to thee for this one purpose that out of this the Holy Spirit might bring together a context that would be sufficient tonight as a Christmas message to thy people that are waiting and we are waiting on thee Lord circumcise the lips that will speak and the ears that will hear and Empower and put life in the words that goes forth that it might bring us to a better knowledge of the Lord Jesus for we ask it in his name amen am writing down many scriptures here to refer to and so forth I was amazed yesterday as I heard that picked up the paper in where there is a what the commercial World calls a bumper Christmas were that there was more money spent this time that ever been spent in many many years since way back many years ago and at the crowds that gathered into Jerusalem and how that there was a little peace time between the Arabs and the Jews that they kind of let down their feeling to let the the pilgrims come into the city again on this uh season of of Christmas I've often wondered why this city was ever chosen Bethlehem as those uh folks sang just a few moments ago the the little fell an's wife and children and the I was amazed watching the little girl how she was keeping the time with this some sort of a strin harp that she was playing and how that little fellow was yet just a baby merely but yet was keeping the time just with the or pick on this heart I suppose it was called a heart now and then I'm thinking of Bethlehem and why did it happen to be that it was chosen to be the birthplace of the king of kings and you know Bethlehem is a a small place very small town I've often wondered why God didn't choose a more religious place for for this great event such as Shiloh Shiloh was the first place the tent the ark was set after Cross Jordan or gilgal another great religious City or Zion on the mountain another great religious City or even the proud capital of Jerusalem with all of its sages and Saints through the age why didn't God choose Jerusalem why would he choose Bethlehem maybe it looked like he might have chose someplace one of the great Cities of Refuge that would have protected his son in case that some trouble come up the Refuge places like Ray Mo Gilead that was a great Refuge that was built for the people could run into these towers kades was another great City of Refuge heon another great City of Refuge why God picked on little Bethlehem and then did not uh choose these greater cities and they had greater names and uh more of a spiritual background but you know God has a way of doing things just his own way about things I'm so glad he does sometimes he takes things that doesn't have a spiritual background or doesn't have any background at all and that's why he is God he can take something that's nothing and make something out of it and that that's what makes him God that's what makes us love him that's what makes us poor people appreciate him because that even though we poor with no background yet God can do great things with us if he ever gets us under his control Joshua of course was the one who taken the children of Israel over and divided up the grounds and this uh tribe of Judah was given this potion where Bethlehem is which is the upper Northern corner of the U province of Judah a little strip that kind of runs out like a little Peninsula and in this place this province this great Province it's the northern wheat country where the wheat belt was where they raised lots of Wheat and barley and one of Caleb's Sons established and founded this city Salam was his name he was one of Caleb's Sons if you want to look that up I'm skipping over a lot of these scriptures but I see some of the Brethren are putting them down and 1 Chronicles 2:15 also you find it in Matthew 1:5 as where they uh he established and founded this great city which was a small City but it's great because of the great things that happened at this city as I've always said it isn't the great church it's a great God in the church amen amen it isn't a great Holy Mountain it's a great holy spirit that was on the mountain amen isn't the holy man it's a holy ghost in the man Hallelujah that's the way this city was it was small in Statue and more in the valley and it wasn't too much to look upon his population was small and is yet today but it was because God chose it to do something amen that's what I like something that God chooses no matter what it looks like the people just as long as God chose it Rahab the Harlot that we're all familiar with she being a a young girl that was turned on the street by Heathen father and mother that put her on the street because she was beautiful and was to bring an income to them on prostitution and yet down in this immoral girl that was turned on the street she had heard that there was a God who answered prayer amen and the first opportunity that she got to accept that God or do something for him she did it God spared her life and saved her father and mother and her family Hallelujah she fell in love with the general in the army of Israel we find in history and married this General and their courtship was wonderful and finally they settled down and lived at Bethlehem and through this General she brought to the world a a son the son of of uh of uh I can't think of the general's name just now I was trying to thought I had his name down here but I don't have her son's name but it was rahab's son to this General his name is Solomon not the Solomon of the built the temple the son of David but another Solomon and this Solomon brought forth a son whose name was Boaz and Boaz oh we are all acquainted with that wonderful story of Boaz and Ruth now you see this Harlot was a gentile and she was an ancient grandmother to our lord Jesus and also when when Boaz her grandson come forth and married Ruth the Mite he also married into a gentile which made Jesus also part Gentile Earthly speaking then when they brought their child forth his name was OED and oid had a son and his name was Jesse and Jesse had a son whose name was David all this taking place in little Bethlehem what is it the lineage of the Lord Jesus amen his backgrounds that the great spiritual man were overlooking are the soall spirit spiritual man and it was on this same grounds that Samuel the prophet anointed David to be king over Israel Hallelujah right here at Bethlehem and through David came forth the great son thou son of David Hallelujah the son that was born in a little stable manger over to the side of the Hill on the west side of the city it was there on that hill where the angels of God sang their first noil Hallelujah the word Bethlehem let's break it down b means house eel means god e h m means bread the house of God's bread how fitting it was then for the bread of life to come out of the Bethlehem House of God's bread oh it's a beautiful story amen it must have been just a little after dark and the sun had gone down the stars probably had been out in the light was about two hours gone as the little donkey was placing his little tired feet up along the back side of the Hill West of [Music] Bethlehem as he watched for he placed his little host because his cargo was precious hallu and Joseph was leading him gently along as the little Trio started up the Healer been traveling all day long coming from down to Nazareth and she was expecting to be mother at any time way past due maybe but all things are foreordained of God that works together for good to them that loving it was ordained of God that there should be a heartless King in that day the bloodthirsty Herod God knew about that God knew about the taxes and how this brutal government did not have no thoughts of the mercy on that poor mother that was just about to be ready to deliver her firstborn son just in a few days but he commanded that they all should come to their native birthplace and pay taxes no matter what condition she's in she's got to come anyhow God knew all about that he for knew all things and he he knows all things he and he makes everything work together for a good the little Trio is making no fuss about it as they come up the hill finally after much groaning the little donkey I can see them as they' stop at the top of the hill where the come up from the West Side from Nazareth coming over and after they top the hill to look down into the valley where little Bethlehem laid many torches was burning many people had gathered from all over Galilee to come into the birthplace there at Bethlehem and through the Providence to be taxed of the Roman government no matter what conditions they strolled along the road the sick and the needy and the bedridden the leper the cancer the the the the poor the lame the halt the blind all had to come because it was a government order and Herod was behind it and it must be done and as our little party stops at the top of the hill there must have been a large Rock laying there I can see Joseph pick her up tenderly in his arms and help her off the little mule and and set her up on the side of the Rock and the little mule sigh for his breath and as Joseph then walked a few steps forward looked down into little Bethlehem and seen the streets crowded and the Roaring the Torches of burning in the streets and the yells of the people and there's laying in the yards and in the courts and all outside the city Gates must have been some sight Joseph must have said something like this Mary dear just think just beyond the city on the North side that's where Ruth the Mite glean Yonder in the fields of Boaz Yonder just beyond that up over the mountain Y is where David with his sling shot took the line to the ground and pull the sheep from his mouth must have been there that word Joshua stood here with his gleaming sword The Fearless Warrior of our people and divided the lands and give this inheritance to the tribe of Judah to which sweetheart we are leanage to and it different things of how that he must been explaining to her what taking place and then to hear no sound from behind him he must have turned to look to see if she was still sitting on the rock and when he turned and he seen her pretty face turned towards the skies he didn't have to ask anymore because the reflection of the star was looking back through her eyes he knew she was looking at something and she looked at him and said Joseph have you noticed the star hanging Yonder and when he looked into surprise say I hadn't noticed it before dear well it's been F us ever since the sun went down I've watched it it must mean something because I have the most wonderful feeling you know God does things like that sometimes for his people shows us a light or some way that we can know that he's near and he's on the scene and no matter what the world has to say or do he's still there and everything will be all right he just Witnesses it back by the holy spirit that we can feel it and Joseph might have said something like this Mary you know what I've never been so happy in all my life when I've been drove around by the Roman government but yet I have never been so happy as I am right now and I don't know why it seems like there's a sacredness over the little city tonight where we roam when we were boys and girls back in our teenage and school age way into the East many hundreds of miles away from there the ma is already on the road they had seen his star and was coming to worship God's little gift package that he was sending to the world just a little while from then and the world was was going to receive its greatest gift that had ever received a little package wrapped up a little first little Christmas package that was ever wrapped in all the world God wrapped it up Hallelujah I want to break in all my thought and say this the greatest thing was ever wrapped in human flesh is wrapped God himself wrapped his own self and a Christmas package and sent it to the worldall why did they refuse it why couldn't they see it why did they turn it down why is it they didn't want it the same reason they don't want it tonight amen it wasn't handed to them in the custom that they were used to gifts being handed that's the reason it's rejected yet tonight is because it's not handed to the people in the custom amen that they have been used to receiving gifts amen but God wraps his own package he's got a right to do it he's the one that's given it amen he has a right to wrap it any way he wants to wrap it doesn't make any difference how it is he's got a right to do it because he's the one that's giving the the gift Hallelujah another thing the reason of it was as it was then so as it wasn't customary for them to receive it the way it was wrapped they was expecting something a gift coming that would come down on chariots with a Angel escort driving fiery horses but when he come as a little baby being born in a manger little did they ever know the scripture said I'll give this world a super [Applause] sign they asked for a sign one day he said I'll give it to you it'll be the Super sign it'll be the sign that'll last to all ages amen a virgin shall conceive and shall bear a child a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel that's the super sign that's the gift that I'm going to give but it didn't come the way they was expecting it and they turned it down so is it tonight my brother God gift hasn't come the way people wanted to come and so they' turned it down they don't want it they want it wrapped in the kind of the goods that they want to wrap it in they want the tensil on it they want something flowly something that's perfumed something that's glittering something that's classic but God don't s it all the time like that amen he sends it in the power the way he wants to send it another thing it was brought by the poor Mary and Martha uh Martha rather or Mary and Joseph was very poor people they were peasants and because it was brought by the poor they didn't want it so is it today when this great gift of the church the Holy Spirit falls upon the poor and humble the rich don't want it they don't want to Humble themselves they want it with class but they don't want it the way God sends it amen many people wants to receive the Holy Ghost but but they want to get it the way they want it but oh I'm so glad that you can't do it that way you have to do it the way God sends it to you Hallelujah and humble ourselves to receive it it wasn't wrapped in fine Linens it was wrapped in swalling claw which I'm taught that the very thing that Jesus was wrapped in the Christ was the stuff off the back of a yolk of an ox that was hanging in the stable he was wrapped in the swalling cloth was the the where they put the rag around the ox's yolk to keep it from rubbing a blister on him when he was pulling they they had no clothes for him and they oh I think of that it nearly breaks my heart no clothes for Emmanuel the creator of of heavens and earth and no clothes for him to put on and had to be wrapped in the rag that a ox had worked his neck through oh what a super sign it ought to be real attractive to the people little Jehovah crying like a baby God made flesh in a package God who covers all space and time before there was a wh or a star or a molecule wrapped himself in a little package and was laid in a Manger in a stable where the manures of the cattle and sheep and things up over that stable and in this little manger on straw or hey Jehovah was laying there crying like a baby Hallelujah can you imagine it why the rich didn't want nothing like that that would pollute their own thoughts anything so humble and would be brought by a girl a little peasant girl that was considered in her neighborhood a fanatic and by a carpenter who probably know ABCs and how could they ever bring forth anything that could talize or appease the eyes of the celebrity how could they ever produce something that would please or satisfy the rich highminded people are the denominations of their days they were turned down flat not only in that day but in this day also they turn it down flat it don't come wrapped the way they want it they want uh to discard it say there's nothing to it so the rich and the denominations refuse that gift they had nothing to do with it why why would they do a thing like that it wasn't wrapped in the custom of their Creeds that's the reason why today that they don't want the gift of God this United States don't want God these churches don't want God that's right they want Santa Claus they want something with t and red colors and and and and bright shiny things they views the truth of the Gospel of the power and the resurrection of Christ Jesus it won't wrap with their Creeds You Can't Rap Christ in a Creed I was listening this morning as I was going down to Mama's early turned on the radio and a a church was quoting or saying the what this called the Apostles Creed there is no such a thing the only Creed the apostles ever know to had is found in Acts 238 repent everyone of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Oh Glory that's the only Creed I ever seen in the Bible they ever used this other is a man-made Creed and you cannot WRA Christ in a Presbyterian Creed or in a Baptist Creed or a Catholic Creed or a Pentecostal Creed the only one thing that Christ will be wrapped in in that your heart not your Creed he wants your heart he's got a control tower there that he likes to work with you bring it eternal life amen he just won't accept and you cannot wrap him in Creed s you can't then you can't now you never will be able to do it so they could not receive it because they thought more of their Creeds and they did other the gift that's the way it is today people can't accept speaking with tongues in their Church it would ruin their Creed they can't accept Divine Healing the baptism of the Holy Ghost and such great Evangelical doctrines of the Bible Apostolic truths why because our Creed condemns it oh how foolish to take the paper the packages wrapped in and throw the gift away like the he took the box and accepted it and throw the gift away that's the way the churches and people do today they forget that the gift of God is eternal life life through Jesus Christ he's rejected as much today as he was then this Christmas night he's just as much rejected as he was the first Christmas night they cannot do it because it disagrees with their Creeds all down Through the Ages we've had the same thing no wonder there was no room for him in the end no wasn't wrapped right it wasn't wrapped the classical paper around it it was wrapped as a gift as a gift from God sent from God am a God that they didn't know nothing about amen they claimed they did and they claim they was looking for him but he did not come in the way that they thought he was coming according to their Creeds and they could not receive God's Gift amen he was wrapped different he was wrapped up like a a baby he was born in a manger he come from poor people he come from a bunch of Fanatics amen so how could they receive something like that no wonder there was no room for him in the end there's no room for him yet in the churches they OU him they don't believe in it they'll set away with such a thing it's fanaticism we want nothing to do with it it's against our father's doctrines the doctrines of this church the doctrin of our uh Creeds of our forefathers therefore Christ is just as rejected today as he was back there there's no room tonight in our good churches our big churches our fine churches there's no room in our religious circles today for a holy ghost meeting they don't want it it it belittles them in the sight of the classes of the country am it belittles them to think that they humble themselves to come down to an altar to cry and to T there until they're filled with power from on high Amen to rise up from there with newness of light to let women let their hair grow out and act like women ought to to make men throw away their cigarettes and quit their drinking and treat their families right it's too much farm so they hold on to the Creed of their church instead of receiving God's Gift God's Christmas gift Lord they' rather have a Creed than they would the gift rather have the paper than the gift they want the paper sure something it's all tensil not a fuss that can do about it but the real gift that's on the inside of it they don't want it see he was wrapped in in a dirty cloth a swalling cloth and he's wrapped today in the same thing which they call Holy r fanaticism a bunch of Heretics it's wrapped up and swalling cloth and the world don't want it oh I'm so glad to raise that cloth off look what's lay underneath it eternal life God made flesh and dwelt Among Us they didn't want him it interfered with their religious circles to receive it today it interferes with them oh if somebody would raise up in the church and start shouting and praising God or somebody say Amen like this group of Minister share something or in the audience quickly an usher would lead him to the door and if you had your name on the book it'd be quickly taken off see God don't don't have a a chance if the president elect Kennedy would visit this city here the flags would would fly and the the tensil would fly and the and the carpets would be rolled out and and such a welcome you you never seen which that's all right if they want to do that he's elect President in the United States but if he'd come they do all of that and they give him the greatest welcome and think that he humbled himself to come to such a small City at Jeffersonville Indiana when New York and the big cities are calling for him everywhere just for a moment of time to speak with him if he'd come to Jeffersonville to a poor City like ours how they would put on what we call the dog and they' do everything and and dress up the streets and and do everything to make him welcome that's all right if you're a politician that's all right but Jesus can come in the form of the resurrection of his power amen can come in the Holy Ghost and can show signs and wonder amen every newspaper will criticize it but people will call Holy rulers they say the people's crazy no wonder we're got an atomic bomb with her name right spurn Mercy there's nothing left but judgment hallu oh they will not receive it they wouldn't man they want now why didn't they do it just want ask why didn't they give accept God's uh Christmas gift why didn't do it they do it if it just the gift that they could have looked at and it was fit in their society it would have been all right if our if this Holy Ghost religion would fit in people's society today they'd take it but why don't they take it them because they think more of their society than they do of Christ that is true amen you say you're speaking awful hard about him I'm taking up for him he's my Lord I have a I'm his servant I have a right to scream out against that that's right and Christians believe that and know that and accept that in order it's of Truth why was the reason they didn't receive this rap package they know what was on the inside of it and they didn't want it that's the reason the churches and people today and the governments and the lands will not receive God's Christmas present is because they know what's in it they don't want it make women act different or make men act different you'll have to bear the name of a fanatic you'll have to take the way with the Lord's dis past few you'll have to clean up your life you'll have to quit your meanus you'll have to stop doing wrong cheating stealing lying committing adultery you'll have to stop these things and the people don't want it although they may know it's right but they don't want it it brings too much truth to them it uncovers their sins so therefore they don't want it don't nothing to do with it keep away from it that's the way it was in that day they know what was wrapped in it so they said away with it they don't want it it's the same thing today amen never want it and they don't want the Holy Ghost today is because they know what's wrapped in it they can watch a a person receive the Holy Ghost ghost they stand out there and see that that woman maybe as low as she could be even the dogs are hard to look at her see that woman come up from that altar a new person to see that woman clean her life up get out and act like a lady see one that runs the bridge parties smoke four or five packs of cigarettes a day hang around the saloons a regular Barfly and they know if they ever accept this gift of God Amen that's wrapped in the package called Jesus Christ Hallelujah it'll spoil every bit of their worldly funds because he won't stand for that it does something to him it changes people people don't want to be changed they let me alone it reminds me that demon possess man that Jesus went over into Galera and there was a man over there had 2,000 devils in him and they said what what are we to do with the why do you come here leave our lands we don't want you here they want to be left alone amen the people felt better at home with the devils and they did with Jesus so they said go on out of our land we don't want you over here poor old Legion is the only one that that wanted help he always comes to those who wants him he comes to those who needs him so he was the only one was help I've often thought when I get to heaven I want to see how much how much weight his testimony give on hog rers over in Galleria if it's go to call them a heard of hogs they didn't want no Revival if it's going to cost people anything they don't want nothing to do with it so it is the is going to cost you your bunk Oak parties big times your cigars your dirty jokes all the filth and things of the world the reason they don't want it it'll cost them something you're a big Society name with a lot of glitter on it but it'll give you a name written in the Lamb's Book of Life not way so you take your your free moral agan oh receive God's Christmas gift is my my prayer for you yes they don't want it because it does something to them or did the government the government didn't want him Herod didn't want him not sir because why he was going to change his program am and the government don't want him today that's right we're supposed to be a Christian Nation amen while the UN don't want him they'll take every other idea in the world besides his they'll never offer prayer there's no prayer at them sessions they just go in there and doggy dog as the old expression is from the street they don't want Christ he'd have to change our programs amen therefore they don't want him they didn't want him then they don't want him now the churches didn't want him because he disagreed with their Creeds he told them that they were said you Generation of Vipers you whed walls he called him everything that could be taught of cold old Herod said go tell that fox and what's dirtier than a fox what's more stinking and low down than a dirty old Fox Jesus that's what he is so he he he called black black and white white he he he called wrong wrong and right right so they didn't want that the churches today don't want a pastor fill with the Holy Ghost that'll really B out tell you what's right and wrong they don't want it they faring right quick diing board get together and turn him away get together and talk about their Creeds brother I know no Creed but Christ no law but love and with the Bible that's what we need that's what the churches need but uh the the people don't want it so they got the church so wrapped up in these denominations till they can take a trustee board or a deacon board and turn a good pastor any way they want to but they can't turn God that's one thing sure God's going to remain God Amen they won't welcome him they welcome their their friends and their politicians and so forth but they won't welcome Christ ni they'd rather have Santa Claus anytime world's Tu over Santa Claus is Tu over well you don't little children don't even know no more What Christmas Means they don't know what Easter means it's a it's a Easter bunny some kind of a rabbit or a little yellow colored chicken or something what's God the resurrection got to do with a chicken the dirtiest bird there is what's any more filthier than a chicken and they put in there to take the place of Christ watch any more of the myth in Santa Claus never was such a thing telling children lies you'll be responsible for it at the day of the Judgment I wonder if people don't know what to do they they just don't want the real thing they'll take anything artificial but they don't want the real thing they don't want the gifts of God oh my certainly they don't want Jesus that's one thing I got rolled down here one reason they didn't morning is because that when he went into their Temple and he found their filth in the temple he turned over the tables and run the money changers out he cleaned it up and if they' ever let the Holy Ghost get into one of these big churches around here he'd clean it up so they can't accept that you see Hallelujah you make them quit gambling make them stop them rock and roll parties putting her picture in the papers beat necks like a Methodist preacher did down here in hard Park Clarksville got a brother sitting here now if he didn't comb his hair down for him and man servant of God put his picture in the paper have a beat neck party of a thing in the church John Wesley know that had turn over his grave wow they turned down the Christ that John Wesley know right and accepted a beat neck they got a beat neck religion they got beat neck children beat neck Papa beat neck Mama beat neck president just one on so this keeps on going oh what a disgrace why they refuse the real God said he' give them over to strong delusions to believe a lie be damned by God said it would do it you refuse right you have to take wrong there's no other way you refuse to go right you have to go left go some other way besides right so you can't go right and wrong at the same time well they refuse the Holy Ghost they refuse Christ they refuse God's program they refuse the messenger they refuse everything so therefore they're left in their sins there's nothing left in but judgment but being that's right just that's exactly right they have they have refused Christ they refused his program they refused his Spirit he's tried for 50 years that the Holy Ghost has been falling in America they've refused it for 50 years and theight is blacker and darker than it ever and even upon those that fell on in the beginning their children has organized and denominated it oh am and wound it into organizations so they are refusing the very God that their fathers receed they claim their Pentecostal no doesn't make a sour horse to live in a barn no indeed he no more than it does to make a Christian out of a man belonging to a Pentecostal church Baptist Presbyterian anything else he's still a sinner until he's converted and when he's converted he's borned again the spirit of God and changed over and he's accepted Christ and the Holy Ghost is coming and made him a new creature a new creation then they refused it then they refused it now he'd turn over their money tables he'd turn over their trustee board their their Pastor board they they would he they get a board all right oh what a difference there be if he come into the churches today but he can't get in we found him the other night in this church age oued out by his own church standing the door knock and trying to get back in again a merciful father after being kicked out by his own people trying to get back in his church again he said I'm the one that walks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks am and on the last Church age here he was on the outside they kicked him out where about and this lady is seeing age standing again trying to get back in again at his own door to his own church what a pathetic thing that's one of the most pathetic pictures that the Bible paints is that second chapter of Revelations the third rather how that it is that Christ out there another pathetic thing I think one of the most pathetic words that Jesus ever said was so he said father I sanctify myself that they might be Sanctified in other words he had a right he was a man he had a right to home he had a right to family was man much man as you are I am as much human in his manhood as we were he had a right to it but he was training 12 men that was going to take the gospel to all the world Hallelujah so he Sanctified himself for their sake I sanctify myself for their sake a gift of God keeping himself Sanctified oh gifts of God you people who claim that you've received this Spirit keep yourself Sanctified Hallelujah keep away from the things of the world be Sanctified oh who did know what was in this gift package was there anybody ever found out what was in it I'm so glad that there was who know it it was a hidden thing a rejected Stone amen but there was somebody found out what was in it I'm so glad we know what was in that little package that we know what has happened in our lives and it's been made real I want to read something brother brandham said something I learned today paragraph 75 he says this they don't want it it's the same thing today never wanted it and they don't want the Holy Ghost today because they know what it's wrapped in they can watch a person receive the Holy Ghost stand out there and see that woman may be as low as she could be till even the dogs would hardly look at her and see that woman come up from the altar a new person to see that woman clean her life up and get out and act like a lady see one that runs to bridge parties and smokes four or five package of cigarettes a day hang around the saloons in a regular Barfly and they know if they ever accept a gift of God it's wrapped in the package called Jesus Christ it'll spoil every bit of their worldly funds because he won't stand for that it does something to them it changes people people people don't want to be changed they say let me alone let's all stand they can watch a person receive the Holy Ghost they stand out there and see that woman maybe as low as she could be till even the dogs would hardly look at her and see that woman come up from the the altar a new person we have seen that very thing in this congregation marily and I learn today there's a homeless woman two years ago sitting outside at this bus stop strung out nothing no hope in life calls out to God says God are you Buddhist are you Muslim what are you crying out to the Lord and the Lord laid it on her heart right out here outside of these doors a homeless lady Lord I want to be baptized you all know her or you should know her because she's been attending this church for a while maybe I'll have her give her testimony I baptized her a few months ago in the name of the Lord Jesus and she comes almost every Sunday morning this church this church believes in the Jesus Christ that this Prophet spoke of and I'll stand on that till the day I die now I ask you as you were listening to this tape what message did this man William Brandon preach did he preach a message of Christ and forgiveness or did he preach a message of denomination and secularism and drawing circles around ourselves what message did he preach you just heard him preach and those of us that listen to tapes a lot we know he says the same thing on almost every sermon it's the same spirit it's called the Holy Spirit and it says the same thing over and over again it is Jesus Christ and him crucified as I said this morning Paul said I don't want to know anything else just Jesus Christ and him crucified there is no one that can say it like William Marian Brandon I love his message I love I love I wish I could have known him but one day I'm going to shake his hand I'm going to give him a big hug and I'm going to say thank you brother brandom thank you for showing me that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever
