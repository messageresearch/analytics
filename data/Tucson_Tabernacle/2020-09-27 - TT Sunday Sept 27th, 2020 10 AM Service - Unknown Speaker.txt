holding my hand the violence [Music] down on my knees i learned to stand and i can't even walk without you holding my i'm learning to lean i'm learning to lead we have a full service this morning just some announcements we're going to make so we're going to do the prayer requests here right away and ed's going to make an announcement and then i also have an announce some things to cover as well so a song special by sister sharon so we're just gonna start here with the prayer requests and praises we didn't have any prayer requests turned in this morning but i'm sure each one of us has a need sister amelia gonzalez turned into praise and she just said that she had a situation on thursday she needed wisdom and guidance dealing with and the lord she prayed and the lord just gave her that guidance and wisdom and was taken care of and resolved the next morning so just praise the lord that he's always mindful of us amen we had about 12 15 yesterday morning we had the house our next door neighbor's house burned down to the ground and unfortunately she's she had dementia pretty bad and but fortunately she got out and we believe her dog got out and um just thankful that no one was killed in it and it wasn't a worse fire that took them about an hour and a half to get it under control they'd ran out of water and burned completely to the ground but just remember her in prayer and her name is gail and she's no family or next of kin really close and it's just a kind of a sad situation but the lord knows every situation amen let's just sing this song if you have a need let's sing it as a prayer and then brother that's going to lead us in prayer this morning learning to lean i'm learning to lead i'm learning to lean on jesus finding more power than i ever [Music] let's pray gracious heavenly father it's good to be in your house again this morning lord lord we come this morning to worship and to praise you lord lord your word says where two or three are gathered in your name that you would be in our midst the father we invite you to come come bless us with your presence may our worship and praise be pleasing unto you lord this morning lord we come also to be corrected and be admonished by the word that's ministered this morning father so lord deal with each heart and each need lord is your word is brought forth these requests lord that have been spoken and those that have enough lifted hand whether here or a wherever lord we'd ask that you'd minister on each need we thank you for answering sister amelia's prayer lord and for this lady gail that lost her home yesterday we pray lord that you'd be merciful lord just come and just minister on each need this morning lord we'd ask in the precious name of jesus christ amen you may be seated uh just want to go over take care of a little bit of church business before we really get going into the into the worship and in into the ministry um i'd like to talk i've talked to brother matt watkins and it's just something that we need to reiterate time to time since coronavirus started brother matt had asked that we would keep every other row empty and if you've noticed coming in the rows that are supposed to be left open are the rows that have the red tape on on each end so we're trying to keep that completely open and i know that there's some families that are pretty good-sized families that actually take the whole row and god bless each of you for it makes the church feel a little more a little fuller but what we'd like to also reiterate is the last two rows in the very back we want to keep that open for the families with small children six and below now obviously if you're a family and that have a couple teenagers but you have a six year old or below you know sit as a family uh we're not going to ask you to get up because you got some teenagers there but we really need your help on this it's hard to come up and ask someone to move you know especially when you're all settled in but it's something that we're trying to keep for the families with small children we don't want to be legalistic in any way shape or form about it but i really appreciate everyone's effort in this you guys have done a fantastic job up to now but we just want to remind you that every other row is supposed to be open and brother matt felt to do that out of respect for what was asked so we could open up again to meet for those that don't mind the young men uh are welcome to sit up on the front row uh that's the way i remember brother green doing it oh and it never hurt anybody so but we would like everyone to i i know i've don't want to separate families and if you could help us by just sitting in a row that's not not marked off or supposed to be left open we would really appreciate it so lord bless you you know let brother jordan come back up amen brother uh brother watkins had said a few comments as well on wednesday night right at the end of service if you didn't have a chance to hear that feel free to go get that on the archive if you don't know how to access the archive let us know and we'll try to assist in making that happen so just love the lord amen amen so back in august i want to say that august 14th where the matthew brother watkins came and shared with the congregation the fellowship hall just his thoughts about the last six months from february uh ninth to august ninth and how that had gone and how coronavirus has just kind of upset and put a pause on a lot of things from his perspective and how he felt like what his desire was to do in that six month trial so during that time we had some conversations and that's what transpired out of those conversations with him and family coming for several weeks and just to try to spend some time here and maybe get some clarity on things as well as uh you know the congregation just get to know them more and so forth and i trust that the trip out for them was a blessing for them and for you all and i think for the matthew's desire i don't want to say i think his desire is to extend that another six months because of the coronavirus just kind of shutting everything down and and not really allowing what he felt like was a trial in his a trial pastoral period for six months so us brothers had talked and our thoughts were you know if the congregation was was was minded to go that way we are we are 100 happy to go that direction um and maybe i wasn't very clear in my comments and maybe i wasn't talking very loud on sunday night in the in the fellowship hall but the real the thought was if you have a something that's different than that you feel strongly that we want to have a vote for the six months another six months or you just want to do something different let one of us brothers know or if you want to be anonymous put a note in the offering tithes box if you feel like something different honestly i think in the last six seven weeks we've only had maybe i only initially had one person approach me and um there was i think brother ed and i have both had an additional person approach us in the last couple of weeks um and i don't think brother arnie brother aaron maybe has had one or two comments questions but if there's if there's a strong you know i don't know what that number is i don't know if it's two or three or if it's 10 i don't know what that number is but if there's a if there's an interest in having a vote i think the vote would be this do we extend this another quote unquote six months to february 9th and i say six months because we've really already worked through the first six weeks of six months six or seven weeks of six months do we extend that another four and a half months to february 9th or do we stop pause and or you might say stop stop that and go on to something else so if our as brothers have felt like we've we're this far and brother matthew feels feels good about it we're just going to continue but if again if if the congregation wants to have a vote this isn't our decision this is the congregation as brother branham says every member of the congregation has a vote so if if you want to vote we don't want to necessarily have to have a vote if everyone's all in agreement and we're just going to move on but if anybody wants to have a vote we're not opposed to that either so you just let us know if you like i say don't want to do it you know make you make your thoughts known feel free to put it in the the offering ties box we've had a lot of support in the other way to let's let's keep going and trying this through february 9th so you just let us know and i hope that what i'm saying is clear if it isn't feel free to ask one of us brothers just for clarification um we don't we certainly don't have it all figured out and we don't know what the end holds but we knew who holds tomorrow we know where we want to go we know we we want to just go to heaven amen we want our lamps trimmed and clear we want them full of oil and so that's that's sort of what my things were any any questions is that clear enough hopefully and if if we if we want to have a vote as a congregation we'll do one here in the next probably middle of october we'll talk to brother matthew about brother watkins about the exact time frame on that but we would do one and we'd just be do we extend this another four and a half four months essentially would be at that point or do we move forward and do something else so lord bless you and don't hesitate to come and talk to us if you have a question so all right i think that's everything unless somebody else wants to say something just leave it at that the old rugged cross made a difference amen you can get caught up in all these little details but ultimately it's jesus it's our focus our desire he's our everything amen [Music] on a hill far away stood an old rugged cross the emblem of suffering and shame [Music] and i love that old cross we're the dearest and best for a world of lost was slain [Music] so i'll cherish [Music] i will click to the old rugged cross and exchange it someday [Music] so despised by the world has a wondrous attraction for me for the dear lamb of god left his glory above to bear oh so i'll cherish the old rugged [Music] i lay down [Music] and exchanging stained with blood so divine a wonderous beauty i see fort was on that old cross jesus [Music] two parts [Music] so i'll cherish [Music] i lay down [Music] and exchange it someday for our crown to the old rugged cross i will ever be true it's shame and re-approach gladly bear then he'll call me someday to my home far away where his glory forever i'll share so i'll cherish till my trophies at last i lay down [Music] and exchange [Music] amen i've got a mansion just over the hilltop i really

us [Music] let's go to the course we're just gonna do the course oh thank you my jesus for the grace that you have given us oh i can't repay from my heart i'd like to say that i think you oh thank you my jesus for the grace that you have given us we could never repay but from my heart i'd like to say that i think you oh thank you my jesus for the grace that you have given us we could never repay but from my heart i'd like to say that i think you one more time brother jordan oh thank you tell him how much you love him for the grace that you have given us we could never repay but from my heart i'd like to say that i think you want to tell them thank you just take a moment to tell them thank you right now just lord we thank you we love you lord we appreciate your goodness and all that you've done for us lord accept that from our hearts lord we mean it with all our hearts today lord in jesus christ's name amen god bless you may be seated for a moment here this morning ministering for us brother isaiah from north carolina he attends brother joe fournier's church and i got a chance to meet with him a little bit and just trusting that the lord has something for us if you come with expectation god will meet it if you don't have any expectation right now get some and say lord you know what i have neither so i had a chance to just spend a few minutes with him and just the spirit and his attitude was just wonderful so god knows those things that he's doing now did brother jordan mention any prayer request i was because sister barbara mentioned to remind us that brother jeffrey they're still trying to find out where the internal bleeding is as he's in the hospital so it lets you remember that and for my family uh if you have the whatsapp or maybe saw on facebook nina and steven have been married for about three and a half years now and had been wanting a child and nina let us know about two or three weeks ago that she thought she might be pregnant but she wanted to confirm and she got it confirmed last week or the week before that she was they were quite excited but thursday she had a miscarriage and of course it's hard it's tough can't in any way say i understand because i don't but the heart hurts and and all but she put out a little testimony this morning on facebook and she talked to me about and she said dad you know we talk about a kind of comfort god is we talk about what he does for us but until you go through it and then you get to really know what god can do for you so she shared and she shared with me a little testimony her boss told her she said nina you of all know that these things don't happen without a reason and i said well there's the first confirmation right there that they've seen the god that you serve alive live india and so she put that up today she said i don't know how or how god does this but he has brought us comfort even though it's a difficult time and she asked that we would thank you because we did put it up on the whatsapp she wanted to say thank you for appreciating your prayers and your thoughts for her but god has a reason and he knows why can't pretend that to say i understand i know how you feel because i don't but he does he knows what it is so he's able to minister he's able to bring so if you have a need you believe god can meet it through the ministry and of the word of god i was speaking to brother isaiah and i said shall we pray together and he said let's do that and i prayed and he said thank you because you just confirmed to my heart in your prayer what god has put i don't know that but god does he's the same yesterday today and forever so brother matt and the family got home it's their home now they're safe he said he'd be streaming in so and i'm going to say this because we've heard it already the brother matt went home because he's not going to be our pastor okay and you know what we heard it from other parts of the country and that's amazing when they know things before we do speaking to brother matt he said don't worry about it i'll take care of that that if you hear that don't take any serious thought about it okay brother matt did not go home because he was not going to be our pastor it was just they had to go home okay it's that simple so he'll be back with us in two weeks or so in the meantime brother isaiah will be ministering this morning this evening and then lord william will minister on wednesday and then um we'll be having some visiting ministers like it was before one week visiting the next week brother matt but we have somebody here who will never leave us never leave us alone he said where two or three are gathered in his name he'll be there in the midst of them so let's let's never forget that let's stand amen and i want to just i didn't really know that song so i'm not going to try and sing it but let's just say thank you lord for saving my soul his brother isaiah and and you just draw if you have a need a desire or or maybe you're sitting there and you're real you're thinking i don't really know what i need sometimes it's hard to put in words or maybe form those thoughts but god knows how how many believes that god knows exactly which of me so oh thank you lord for saving my soul oh thank you lord for making me home oh thank you lord for giving to me [Music] i'd like to welcome the johnson family back all the kids are here they're feeling good so i know they all got sick and i believe that the roberts missed some time too because some of the kids are sick but god is mindful of us all isn't he amen so oh thank [Music] you [Music] or make it [Music] amen god bless everyone this morning it's so good to be here our first time uh it's always been my desire a man to come here and some years ago when i first heard of uh brother perry green it was my heart desire to see him and what it was my heart desire to come here and minister but i say within myself that i never happened because i i didn't felt like i i was worthy amen but by the grace of god we're here amen if you be seated we're just going to sing a song and we'll introduce ourself and maybe the next time or we hey man we'll have to do all this uh in the key of d just for me you know that song amen so let's try it amen what does the crawl of jesus mean it means more than a song we sang much more than that ambulance on your chain but it means i am free yes from the chain of slavery and the blood that was shed won't let my sin remain what does the cross of jesus mean it means more than a song we sing [Music] much more than that emblems on your chains but it means i am free yes from the chain of slavery and the blood that was shed won't let my sin remain upon the cross my savior died the lamb was crucified show us love that this world has now been known oh what love divine so divine truly love you never find so that you may live the light came and died alone thank you lord where the cross will always represent the love god had for me when the lord of glory hadn't sinned gave all all calvary and he did it for me just for me oh jesus came and did it just for me let's just say something so we could all feel comfortable i know how it feels when you don't know the song amen i'm sure the musician they have the right key a man but perhaps never heard the song but let's try this song here amen oh how i love jesus i believe we all could sing that together let's write in the key of f how many you love him this morning oh how i love jesus singing how i love jesus [Music] i love jesus because [Music] there's a song

shed his blood that we too may have the right to the tree of life oh how we love them this morning first time here but the bible declared what the spirit of the lord is there's liberty and we feel the presence of the lord and i know without a shadow doubt that we feel at home first time here but i feel at home i was told that uh the the prophet of god stood behind this sacred desk and it gave me such an honor to a man just to stand here and uh i i feel within myself i'm not even worthy but because of the sovereignty grace of god we hear this morning but that'll be all the music we appreciate the music amen i don't want to hold you along amen just let me introduce myself uh my name of course uh my name is brother isaiah chisholm a man i'm 60 years old praise the lord just turned 60

she's 21 years old so i'm still doing good remember the ages so i every once in a while i have to practice and make sure i'm still here amen so we just appreciate the lord and amen appreciate brother aaron amen just speaking what's up in the back i i love his spirit and the lord just had him to just pray with me and the lord just gave me a confirmation amen on what the thought that he a lie on my heart and uh this morning i got up and i was just praying on which direction to go and i had a message the bride of christ is the eternal thoughts of god may manifest but the lord was telling me no that that's not what i want you to preach so the lord put this on my heart and if you will you stand with us amen and we are just first of all we're just going to pray we appreciate brother matt a walking's a man i've known his father for quite some while now or about over about 25 years or more and amen we just appreciate and we long grown to know brother matt as well amen we appreciate the spirit brother very humble man of god amen so let us just buy our heads in the word of prayer if you will con heavenly father such an an honor to be your god and stand behind this sacred death so lord and father if you could just take these dry lips of clay and father if you could just move me completely out of the way and you have full preeminence oh god and lord god i pray father you allow me to say the things that you want me to say lord not of my own and lord i'm flexible enough if you want to change my thought lord we will go what you want us to say oh god lord you lead us and you have full preeminence lord and may our hearts burn within us oh god as we see the lateness of the hour and lord my heart really goes out lord and lord we was talking oh god last night with my precious brother oh god lord how we just had a wonderful fellowship and having a burden for the people of god so father as we approach to read your word father may you come and i miss we pray that you're not the congregation lord and may you anoint me father this reacts in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ amen those you while you're standing we just turn in our bibles amen praise the lord amen we're turning our bibles to the gospel of john the 12th chapter and we read from verse 20 down to 24 and we go to uh philippians the third chapter to scripture and we let you be seated amen are we there by saying amen the gospel of john the 12th chapter and the 21st it's talking about the son of man being glorified knowing jesus was the son of man he was god emmanuel in flesh that's right the bible said and there were certain greeks among them that came up to worship at the feasts the the same came therefore to philip uh which was of bethesda of galilee and desire him saying sirs we would see jesus philip cometh and telleth andrew and again andrew conjunction working together unity and philip telleth jesus and jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the son of man shall be glorified verily verily i say unto you a separate corner weak fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it'll bring it forth much fruit now let's turn with me to philippians the third chapter and verse 10. philippians 3 and verse 10. paul writes here he says that i personal that i might know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowshipping of his suffering being made conformable unto his death let us just buy our heads again father we thank you lord jesus for the reading of your word now lord god sanctify it to our soul this reacts in jesus name amen and amen you may be seated and we just be all right we just take this jacket off praise the lord amen i laid my watch here and our time back home is it's three hours uh right now back home it's uh it's two o'clock so we're gonna try to watch our time amen we don't want to uh we just want the lord to have full preeminence amen so my thought this morning by the help of the lord is amen sirs we would see jesus amen and the prophet of god spoke this message amen uh many years ago and it was really inspired to my heart amen sirs we would see jesus amen so we we see that is our whole purpose of coming to church is to see the lord jesus christ that's our whole ambition and if we don't get to see him then we have come in vain so to speak that's why we're here we're here not so much to see one another or what you sister what dress you have on or how your necktie look or are you wearing the same suit that you woe last week it's not about that we're here to see christ amen we are here to to look into the mirror of the word and examine ourself by the word amen so we we have to examine ourselves by the word the apostle paul wrote one time he said he said examine yourself prove your own self and i tell a lot of folks you know when we come to church a lot of times folks they look at others and try to see what kind of lifestyle that they live in that's not what paul told us to do he told us to examine ourselves and to prove ourself and to see rather we are in the faith make sure we got the revelation to get a body change make sure we have what it takes to make the rapture amen i appreciate my brother i appreciate my sister i appreciate my leader amen but i need to know do i have what it takes to make this rapture amen and uh a few years ago when we came into this message in 1984 i was 24 years old amen a young man just started uh ministering the word of god and uh we we from we came from out of uh uh pentecost amen and we come to the message in 84 and you know we was ministering and god was doing some things but look good the lord kept me amen the lord always kept me for uh being high lifted up amen always god somehow jesus kept me to be humble because i know the great one is the lord jesus christ amen there's no great one among us but the lord jesus christ that's who we worship that's the one we look up to that's the one our heart desire to see amen the songs say oh i want to see him just to look upon his face amen so that is our whole heart desire but about uh from uh starting a ministry as a young man and many years passed by and about 20 years later i remember the home church that i was attending amen back in 2013 the the reason why i feel impressed to preach this message sir we will see jesus 2013 uh brother aaron i was uh i was at my home church and uh we was praying as we would normally do but that particular time when i was praying and we all should pray amen the bible said i would that man pray always amen so that is how heart desire lord keep me from the evil of this world lord keep me from the hour of temptation lord don't let me go into the snares of the enemy but lord let me keep my eyes on the cross but that particular day amen a night of that evening i was praying as i would normally do for for many many years but amen but there came a time of the season as solomon said there's a time and there's a season for all things so that particular day uh evening i was praying and the lord spoke to me amen and and i'm sure the lord speaks to you because it's a good thing when god could speak when our heavenly father could speak to his children it'll be a sad thing to know that you got a father that would never speak to you oh my it'll be a shameful thing amen but that particular day i was evening i was praying and the lord spoke to me brother aaron he says uh accept the corn a week fall into the ground and die and i kept praying but the lord kept saying accept the corner we fall into the ground and die but i kept praying and it was almost like the lord said do you hear me and the lord kept saying accept a corn or wheat fall into the ground and die but i kept praying and the lord said again accept the corner weak fall into the ground and die so in my spirit i was like lord you know i've heard so when prayer was over i got up and uh i sought and i turned in my bible to the gospel of john the 12th chapter and i found where the greeks wanted to see jesus and as i began to read read the word of god so always go back to see what the prophet of god says about it and the prophet of god says you know in so many words he said god will come to you and amen he wants you to die but if you don't die the way amen god desires for you to die then you become religious are you hearing me let me just read something to you uh uh praise the lord because i don't want to get ahead of myself i i want to just take my time but yet i want to hurry up amen would that be all right amen it's easily amen you you pull and i preach amen you amen and we'll be finishing uh amen and we just go uh to the next service but i it it's good to be here in the presence of the lord amen like i said uh praise the lord i i i put something here i just wanted to slow myself down it's so important amen so the lord kept saying accept the corner we fall into the ground and die it abideth the law and and i i went to hear what the prophet of god uh began to say and this is what he said in 1962 why in the message why he said jesus said except a corn a week fall into the ground and die it abideth alone and the people don't want to die you want to be religious so you accept a intellectual conception of it and then when you do that you are still dead in sin and trespass and that's what makes people act and do the way they do because the spirit that's in them dominates their lives so i begin to lord begin to tell me it's time for you to die you say wait a minute brother you've been preaching for all those years now god telling you it's time for you to die yes you'll be amazed what people don't want to die of you know like i was telling my precious brother yesterday we all fighting something in this on in this earthly house amen i might be fighting this thing amen and you might be fighting that thing but we're gonna have to die amen in order to see christ accept the corner we fall into the ground and die it'll abide abides along so i'm thinking within myself lord what are you saying and after the lord begin to show me that you got to die you got to die first of all you got to die from your pentecostal ideas and you got to come into a new day a new message amen you see pentecost went as far as they can go and today uh if you don't mind me saying i i preach out the same uh bible that uh uh uh my pentecostal brothers preach out of but today they're reading out of a closed book but god has enlightened us amen to have a book amen it's an open book it's not a closed book but i thank god today god was telling me accept the corner we fall into the ground and die it'll abide the law i said lord what are you saying he said you you you won't be able to help nobody i said what do you mean he said first of all how you going to help somebody you can't even help yourself wow he said except you fall into the ground and die you got to die it's one thing falling in the ground but there's another thing when you die you got to completely die you got to complete you said well a brother told me one time he said brother uh uh pentecostal brother he come to the mets and he went back amen he said brother uh uh uh people don't they overlook me he said i've been in the way for 40 years i said brother elder do you mind me telling you one thing i said your problem is you've been in the way too long what you need to do is get out the way and let god have his way a lot of time we we don't leave enough room to let god speak to her and let god tell us what he want us to do and you said brother children how can you preach like that to a messy church well my brother and sister i feel impressed in my heart uh places i've been gone i've seen people jump and shout and run the aisle and long dress and long hair amen and when the pastor leave they go back into the world they cut their hair they go back to movies they go back to television they go back to shack and go mix marriage and all that stuff why because they never die they never die they have gone to church amen they have amen they have some song but they themselves need to die and i begin to talk to the lord lord say it's time for you to die it's time for you to die you can't go no further you've got to die to set the corner we fall into the ground and die if it don't it can't bring forth no fruit you can't help nobody so the lord began to talk with me then paul apostle paul picks it up in philippians 10 3 and 10 or 10 and 3. it says that i might know him how many you like to know him now that word no is to understand him you know it'll be a sad thing to to go to church and you really don't know him you're just going to church where where you go to church at oh i go to uh uh tucson tabernacle really yes oh we got uh brother so-and-so he's our pastor and we got this and that that is good but what is the purpose the thing is have you had a nature change are you born again are you born again of it's got to be a death barrier and resurrection so what the lord was saying you got to know me in the power of my resurrection in the fellowshipping of my suffering it's more than just going to church and just warming the pews you got to know me you got to know me by divine revelation that what apostle peter said amen that we may know the divine nature of god god is love god is peace god is hope lord i want to know you in your suffering i want to know you lord i want to know you with all of my heart i said lord begin to come into my heart and you said wait a minute brother you mean he said you've been preaching all that long and that let me tell you paul had a progressive ministry william branham had a progressive ministry you could come see i i tell the folks a lot of times there's a lot of people that some some come to church some uh uh some ascent someone went and some just got up and you know some sent some call and some just got up and went so my purpose is when we come to church what is the purpose i i asked myself i come to church i'm not here to see who's here lord i come here to see a change in my life i said lord there are some ways about me i just don't like there's some things about me i know i can't take those things with me lord there's there's ways about me perhaps the way i treat my wife that is not like your god i said lord god begin to help me why because god said you got to die accept the corner we fall into the ground and die it'll abide the law i thought of the question getting to know him going to church do you do you really know him have you ever had that relationship with him can you imagine uh uh i know a church i won't call name about 500 people but just recently the church split and the people some went back into the world and the same very one that came up and sung oh how i love jesus crying with tears and today where earrings and cut their hair and going back into the things of the world what was it she never got to meet him she never got to meet the person that's what we need to know the person of the holy ghost because the pressure that's coming on this age you got to know him by divine revelation if if i would ask you the question who is the president of the united states who's the president of the united states who donald trump well let me ask you this question what normal president is he 45 wow 45th president for deliverance five is grace he know that i want to ask you a question how well do you know donald trump hmm well let me ask you another question have you ever been at his house wow have you ever been at your house hmm you look by the shop this morning with that bow tie have you ever ate with him wow wow um well have you ever have you uh have you ever went fishing with him [Music] but you say you know donald trump see you see see where people are they come to church oh yes i know jesus yes i know this message but when pressure come they go back into the things of the world you know i tell my children oh you know i desire my children to go to church but don't go to church because daddy loved the lord you got to have a relationship with god you got to know him in the power of his resurrection that i might know him and you know and and the lord began to uh uh to share with me you got to know you got to you have to have a relationship with me but you find uh amen there's there's many people today yeah as i was asking the young man's and glory to god y'all catch your picture right that's just how it is that's just the way it is you know william brown oh yes he's a seven angel yes yes he preached here before what good is that if you don't know him yes william brown oh uh this and that and god did these things for him yes that was for william branham but what about you oh william branham had an angel that went before him that is good but what about you who is leading you is you is you moving off your parents are you here because you don't have no s to go are you here because you love the lord god are you here because you're afraid you're going to a devil's hell i'm not afraid of going to the devil's hell i can't go to hell amen i come from god and i'm going back to god i realized that you know when i was a young boy the devil used to boohoo me amen and tell me the booger man gonna get you and you're gonna be lost but now god has given me a revelation i can't be lost it's impossible are you hearing me if you come from god you're going right back to god but you got to know him you got to have a relationship with them you have to have been in that room you can't go off somebody else's experience i hear my brother was talking to me today he was telling me about his experience that his experience he gonna need those things would he come up against the enemy he's gonna have to have a tie pose what about your typos i've seen churches where the pastor pass and go on i see the people go back into the world to go back into the things of the world i've seen them go back and get television get go to movie shows and and just do things of the world but all of us all along why the past was there and let me tell you if you come into church and look good for the past you coming for in vain we come to church because we love the lord god amen amen i don't look at the things of the world because i i'm afraid my pastor going to see me i do that because i love the lord jesus christ amen i flew all the way from north carolina amen i've come here to tell you amen that people better make sure that they know that they know that they know that they know that they know that they have something inside of them when this translation takes place we're going you said well brother children i've been good oh come on please do you know good old boys go to don't go to heaven good old boy just don't wear the crown you got to be born again jesus made the steak man amen you must be born again i know you know my brother a lot of folks they they laugh at nicodemus the reason they laugh at nicodemus nicodemus being a ruler of the jews the bible said that nicodemus what came to jesus in the daytime huh when did he came he came at night i wonder why he came at night you reckon he didn't want to be seen well you know folks they remember those things but at least he came some folks don't even come at night some people stay home because they're tired but at least nicodemus came to jesus by night now i'm sure nicodemus had prestige and he didn't want uh folks to see him coming at night because he had a high position but nicodemus came to jesus by night and he asked jesus i could imagine when he came in let's say he came in the room where jesus was at he asked him to say good master we know that you are a man that come from god now nicodemus that shows right there nicodemus didn't know the godhead jesus was god he was emmanuel but nicodemus asked the question now nicodemus was very serious and that's what we got to be serious about our salvation nicodemus asked the question he said master we know that our teacher that come from heaven for no man could do these miracles that thou doest or what accept what god be with him so nicodemus was curious he was very serious in his salvation or his walk with god he asked a question say how can how can a man be born when he is old hmm he said master can he enter the second time into his mother's womb now there is nicodemus having an intellectual conception huh he's trying to figure out i'm 200 pounds six foot three how i'm going to go back in my mama womb and be born again and that's the way a lot of us amen have an intellectual conception of christ you can't know him by intellect you got to know him by your heart the devil choose the head god chooses the heart i thank god i accept this message by with my heart with all my heart i believe this message it's just said the lord somebody asked me the question the other day say are you following william brown i said this assurance i'm a black man where you going i'm following william brown they said why are you following the man i said well then paul said follow me as i follow christ huh i'm going to follow this message amen amen see folks see william brown but i see the god of william brown are you hearing me i see something that can cause our body to be changed so i'm following the god of william brown because william brown has gone on but the god of william branham is here today the god of william brown it's sitting on the view beside you the god of william brown is beside you but lord god i got to know him i got to know him that he had the power the power me and brother luther i'm saying that right brother luther i get named miss up mix up when i get up here me and my precious brother yesterday when i date lunch together and you know we rub shoulders with the world the world has so much to offer but i need to know that he had the power that can keep me the power that can cause me to turn my head a power that can cause me when i hear things of the world that's something that can block it off amen we went in we went into some of the restaurant yesterday and they had music playing and and my brother said uh asked me about it i said well i heard it and i don't hear and it's called what rock and roll well i ain't never fought them devils and i was in the world because i i never went to the clubs but that don't make me no better but i don't have to fight alcohol i don't have to fight uh smoking cigarette those demons can't attack me because i've never done those things how you hear me but the devil knows the weakness and that's what he challenged me with so that's got to die that's that point got to die accept the coin you want to die you got to go down here you got to die i said but yeah you got to die you got to meet me at calvary but a lot of times you know we live in an age now amen uh since at the church some years ago she told the pastor uh she was one of the sisters in a high position she was a judge at that particular time she told the pastor said oh i she said you mean say you got to die he said yes you you got to die you and she always loved to keep keep her hair shaved up and he told her no you're supposed to have your hair long a woman not supposed to put scissors in her head hey man but she said you know what past she said i've tried and i tried and i tried he said what's what's wrong she said i try to die but it's hard to die when everybody else is living and you found out that's what folks does when god called you as an individual when god said you yeah you over here come here my sister you yell you with the glass song with the red come here i want to come i want to come into your flesh i want to wake up my seed and you who me yeah he called you he called you see we are not we're not jews he didn't call us as a whole he called us as an individual everybody don't get to hear this call but i thank god i heard him when he called my name amen i thank god i ain't just talking about the book of isaiah amen i heard that he called my name by revelation and i'm going to follow him all the way up set the corner we fall into the ground and die it'll abide the law so nicodemus asked the question how can a man be born when he's old and jesus said that's simple that's simple he said uh nicodemus he had to share with nicodema it's on a spiritual uh application of revelation amen amen so nicodemus didn't understood amen but in order to be born again it must be a death a burial and resurrection in other words amen when i come from out of the world do you realize amen people come from out of the world and i i hope this don't don't hurt and and i just wanted to be honest because it really hurts my heart when i feel like i should have spoke the truth because i've gone to a place where everybody just looked so so holy and and sometimes you'd be surprised what people would do i i remember my preacher out of church one time and they man every time i got close to that sister her eyes began to kind of look real funny i'm like what's going on couldn't find out her husband couldn't do nothing with her she looked real humbling in the church real night but boy when she got home she was just as mean as a buzzsaw but in church hallelujah praise god now jesus loved me it's got to go deeper than that this holy ghost got to go home the holy ghost got to be with me everywhere i go can the church say amen don't you love him this morning amen oh i want to see him just to look upon his face so nicodemus asked the question how can a man be born when he is all can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born again so jesus had to explain to nicodemus how did it have to be a death a burial and a resurrection and i found out following jesus little by little he takes the appetites of the world completely away from me nobody can do that but jesus nobody and the more i follow him the more the things start dropping away i used to wonder how can i get over this how can i get over there i don't want nobody to know you know i'm a minister i'm a christian i don't want nobody to know i got this weakness but you know what i did i learn to follow him and the more i follow him little by little things begin to drop off can somebody say hallelujah hallelujah i thank god for his grace i thank god for his race um you know i'm so happy mother i don't have to come to church and impersonate nothing i am what i am by the grace of god i don't buy god's grace i don't have no skeleton in closet i don't have no girlfriends on the side i i i got one wife and i got three sweet daughters and that's all i need and i got six grand so i'm not trying to come up here and preach you a good sermon because there's a god that can see all things amen i fear the lord the bible says to fear the lord it's the beginning of wisdom with wisdom entering to the heart the knowledge is pleasant to thy soul oh god i love you oh how i want to serve you i just want to please you that's my heart desire lord i just want to please you and i just want to tell the people make sure the prophet god preach a message be certain of god be certain of god brother i knew within myself i knew there was something that i need to get over how have you ever been there before this is something that's bothering me and i need to get over that weakness you say brother children is is is it somebody you uh got hatred again no i don't i don't wrestle that because i don't worry about my enemy my enemies can't harm me my enemy is this flash right here amen that's the one that tells me bad things amen but i said god i must die in order to walk this walk because you don't want to be half stepping you want to be a a true genuine christian in the church and out of the church you said brother children why are you talking like that i'm trying to tell folks today amen it's no time to impersonate because the pressure is coming on amen as time go on it's getting worse and worse we never thought we're living a time where we got the word masses did you ever thought that did you ever thought my brother you walk in the bank with a mask on your face and they'll tell you to come up we're living in that time prayerless time and the bible said paul said in in timothy 3 that prayerless times should come and that's what he said the prophet of god said pearls pearlescence intellectual conception paul picks it up and said prayerless times second timothy 3. perilous mean dangerous in other words people instead of their accepting god and dying if they don't die then they'll go on and the prophet god said they become religious and when you become religious i i know this message may not it may be better tonight but look when you become religious then nobody can tell you nothing you feel fine just the way you are and do you know the prophet god said a religious spirit is five times worse than any spirit there is i said god don't let me be religious amen but let me be the genuine one holy ghost a man so i can look the devil right in the eye and say you get off of my ground you don't have a right to get on my sister why because it's a son of god a daughter of god that is speaking to you why because i've been born again the old man has died old man has died i used to tell folks hey man if you see me don't don't don't don't wonder so much if you if you see me every time i open my car trump trunk or you look in the back of my truck i got a shovel back there he said brother children what are you doing with a shovel i thought you come up here to preach what what are you digging i said well what i got a shovel for i'm burying me every day then paul said we got to die daily ain't nothing good an old wretched man of mine ain't nothing good about this flight i was just thinking the other day the lord was just speaking to me that all flesh is as grass your flesh is just like my flesh huh we all is dirt your dirt is light mind a little darker but we are there huh are you with me i'm just being real hey man you know sometimes folks come to church they feel like they look better you know because their hair more slicker and uh uh that don't mean nothing they man hey man you can have sleek hair you can have curly hair you can have nappy hair if your heart ain't right hey man you go you're gonna be left behind so look there ain't nothing good in this flash brother i uh pardon me i just i'll just be at home can i be at home that's the best way to be amen i'm not trying to be this brother or that brother i just being brother children i found out that this old stinking flesh and a bitter good i took a shower last night and got up this morning wiped with a rag it's still dirty nothing but dirt what is this but there's something in the inside with a control towel which is that so something in the inside is hungry and thirsty for god do you love the lord i don't want to hold you along but accept that corner we fall into the ground and die in 1961 brother brown will preach you must be born again now let me say this right here i remember back in 19 or 2007 i was riding to work early one morning and i was listening at the message uh the prophet of god preached you must be born again now i'm going to say that to say what i'm getting into amen so the prophet god preached a message you must be born again wow that's that's good but then he read john 3 but then he went to ephesians 4 and 11. and i'm trying to figure out what ephesians 4 and 11 got to do with you must be born again let that soak what does ephesians 4 in a level have to do with john 3 16. prophet why do you read john 3 ephesians 4 and 11 and ties it with john 3 16. so after the lord gave me this thought you know how the bible said that how the greeks there was there was great ark athletes and uh there was well-known people but you know the greeks they they they wanted to see jesus and the prophet god said the reason they wanted to see jesus because they heard about lazarus they heard about a man that was dead for four days and he was alive we want to see him and the bible said in romans that faith coming by what hearing the word what word it's the word for your day that's what gives us rapture and faith if that's right are we right is the word right it's hearing the word for your day so i goes on hearing the word for your day well the prophet of god said many of them came to see jesus because they they came because of the miracles do you know a lot of people serve god because god is good to them gave them a new car and home and called i don't care if he don't give me nothing i'm still going to serve him with all of my heart i'm still going to love him amen with all of my heart but so the greeks they they they they wanted to see jesus my question is do you want to see him do you really know him you don't have to raise your hand but do you really know him did you really have a relationship with him since you've been coming all these years do you really know him oh brother children i know i know him sure you do do you know him in the power of his resurrection the fellowshipping of his suffering i want to demonstrate something here let me read this to you that be all right brother let me read this to you and this kind of kind of help us a little bit in 1954 the assembly of god phoenix arizona my the prophet of god the prophet of god said no matter how much you've been going to church how well is your name is engraved on its stained windows or on his books it never means nothing to you until you are and witness of the resurrection of jesus christ and by the infilling of the power of the holy spirit you are taking somebody else's word well brother browner i know that jesus is christ because the bible says so the bible is right but what do you know about it see it's an individual affair with every individual then i say that with every individual a personal witness that every person must have in order to know that jesus christ is the son of god is when his spirit bear record with your spirit in the spirit of the new birth born again and you cry out of a father oh my if we had a world like that tonight the millennium would be on wouldn't it that's right when you the spirit buried record with his spirit that you the son and the daughter of god now the reason i read uh the prophet of god the lord was showing me ephesians 4 and 11. and brother branham as he go along he was saying that ephesians 4 11 we all familiar with that the bible talk about uh he sent uh someone asked a question in the uh one of the in the seal book page 494 495 they asked a question that was sincere let's say we're the bride of christ they asked brother brown will the bride of christ have a a a ministry what before the rapture he said yes it's consisted of and he goes on to say the pastor the teacher the evangelical song he said amen he said but it would be so humble catch that it'll be so humble we talked about that it'll be so humble so i'm saying that it'll be so humble so the prophet of god said we'll have he says now i say that to say this now when the greeks came to philip what was the purpose of they coming to philip because they knew that philip knew exactly how to get to jesus now what i'm trying to say you you need to know you need to have a man of god that knows or having a relationship with god not preaching on what somebody else said not because william brown was a prophet but he got to know that by divine revelation if he don't it's going to be a shipwreck down the road he's going to say he's gonna denounce this message i've seen it happen church i've seen 30 years preaching this message and get to a day where they said his message is false i've seen the brother say take the half my head off of the wall take every everything out of the book that's talking about william branham he has caused us nothing but problems but years down the road he said william brandon was god's prophet see the devil knows that so you got to make sure i know him by revelation ain't nobody told me i know that so the prophet god said that some that that'll paint you a uh uh a painted fire they'll let you know my sister my sister you look real nice just got to be your husband you look real kind you you look so sweet i'll tell you and says you just be nice to your husband and now that's the holy ghost that is a false birth just being kind is not good enough if that soul didn't change amen you're not going can i just be plain like that so the prophet of god saying they'll give you a fourth birth i've known i know brother i've known i've seen brothers that amen they that you know they you should love your pastor i mean you should love him my mind did that day you know uh he they they they they they want to shoot his coat his hat and hey man they want to be like him i don't want to be like no man i want to be like a man i don't want to be like me i don't even like me but i don't like me you like you but i've seen i've seen brother be nice to the past and bring his coat give him water brother that's the holy ghost is it really that ain't what jesus said jesus said because you cared to pass a cup of water and give him a cake on his birthday jesus said what you got to be born again you got to be born again you got to have an experience let me let me maybe i'll do this right here i hope y'all can see me when i walk down here i'm just home i'm home hello i'm home being an eyewitness been the eyewitness of his resurrection disexpose the prophet of god talk about in a message an eyewitness my sister's it's just supposed my brother you ate a a restaurant and you sitting with your back turned towards the busy highway or you're following me and you sitting there you laughing with your friend and you're just having a good time just talking and just just having a good time and you can hear the cause in the background just passing back and forth and you're just having a good time and all of a sudden you just heard a racket and you you get up and you turn around and you look oh my god and you see a car over there upside down and you see a car over there and this young girl in there and a cell phone and down in the floorboard now you know what she probably was doing right that what you think she laying down she her car is all torn up with a cell phone in the bottom of the car and he goes over here this old lady over here just shaking you say oh my god my god i know i know what was happening i know what your girl she was on that cell phone nobody telling me i got proof she got a cell phone there she was on her cell phone she she wasn't paying attention that's what these young folks do they get on their cell phone and she calls this accident look at this old lady he's about to die ma'am man we get you some help well all all that's over where you end up in court and you're in court and the judge asks you to come up and you come up and say honor he said have you was your eyewitness yes your honor yes

well your honor i was in this restaurant and i was doing this and me and so and so we was having a good time and oh my it was wonderful and all of a sudden i i i turned around and and the judge listening very carefully all your words and i turned around and the judge said you did what i i turned around sir and when i turned around i saw cars i saw an accident and i ran over there and that young girl ran and he said wait wait a minute wait a minute back up back up back up back her she said yeah yeah what do you saw she said i turned around he said man man wait a minute so you didn't actually see when they collided she said no he said ma'am i can't use that that won't stand in court she's not an eyewitness she just going by what she assuming she assumed that young girl was on the cell phone the old lady could have been doing something wrong are you hearing me so you just can't assume you got to know because we're getting ready to get out of here this world cannot hold on much longer do you know the wrath of god is hanging over america by rotten thread do you know any moment god could say come my child come i'm talking about i'm telling my brother yesterday do you know amen i i was at stake and my heart began to bleed when they passed the law of same-sex marriage you know when i saw that brother you know what i did i said thank you jesus thank you jesus somebody saw you losing your mind i said man that's a signpost you say well so you you you love that kind of stuff no it's a signpost jesus said when you see the day of solomon gomorrah as it was in the days of noah so shall be in the day of the coming of the son of man so those days let me know we are getting so close brother brandon said watch those two angels billy graham and old robinson been going off the scene a few years ago what old robinson billy graham left off the scene brother brown said watch those two angels how many of them know him say that watch those two angels he said when he left out of

hallelujah that's my whole heart desire is lord keep me near the cross where you shed your precious blood lord god lead me to calvary that's why so many is drifting away because they have never been to cavalry i want you thank god you've been to calvary do you think god you are identified with his death his barrier and his resurrection there was a man that went to this museum i maybe have the story a little wrong and we went to this museum museum there was different paintings of pictures different statues and things of that nature but he had this man that's called a guide and this gentleman would take him around and show him the different pictures the painting but it came to this one particular painting or statue and it was the statue of the painting of the lord jesus christ this man looked at it and he said within himself what an artist what is this he began to mock this picture or this painting he didn't seem much to him and the guy told him said sir there's a there's a sign right beneath that picture or that painting says it means and that on that on that little sign it says it's not made to stand off and stare it's made to kneel down and look up i might be in bits and pieces but you put it together my whole heart is for god's people we're in an hour where the greatest battle that was ever fought that was in the mind but i thank god for the holy ghost in this hour that can keep me from all temptation of the enemy but with that man he walked up and he said what's the use he he knelt down when he knelt down he looked up and the prophet god said when he looked up every bone in his body almost paralyzed him when he seen the pain and the suffering and the agony that jesus went through and today i could thank god for his grace today i could thank god i love him because he first loved me i love him because he chose me before the foundation of the world i love him because he put my name on the lamb book of light before there was a world i thank god i was a thought that was in his mind before there was a world i thank god the lamb was slain before i got here because god knew that we'll live here in this dark age of laodicea was people right when the pressure of this age the love of this world so man has fallen away the love of many are whites and cold but i thank god for his grace i thank god i could say today jesus keep me near the cross serves we will see jesus coming to church and going back home what happened and the question is when i came to church that i that i come i came to church with a attitude man i came to church with an attitude and some simply say well i had an attitude i i i did i didn't want to listen at my husband i but since i come to jesus brother children i'm not going to go back home the same way it's going to be a change why because i've been to calvary why because i met calvary now i met him in the power of his resurrection god help us let us by heads father god lord jesus oh god help us in this hour

he said slain from before the foundation of the world he had already made provision for this and it just came to my mind way back in the creation in the garden of eden god had already had a lamb in the garden of eden he had already made provision for what was going to happen [Music] knowing that they were going to need a blood covering they were going to try to cover themselves with their own religion with fig leaves but there was a lamb in the garden who was going to take an innocent life was going to be shed and that's what he did on calvary for you and that's what he did on calvary for me he's already made provision you say it's so hard to die it is this flesh doesn't want to die but he's already had a life prepared that when this one dies that other life can come through we spoke of that on wednesday night standing in the in the courts of god being raised up in that new life let's stand how many would say keep me near the cross what is being near the cross as a spectator no by giving your life there were those who watched the death of god but it didn't affect them it didn't mean anything well if you're if you're really the son of god then get off that crossing and save yourself but there were others who realize that this this one was going into the ground to give me life amen let's sing that chorus one more time be my glory [Music] beyond more of you more of you let's bow our heads maybe you would just for a moment what is quiet say lord there are some things in my life that that i'm still struggling with they're they're they're showing a little bit of life in there and i want to surrender it all i want to be willing to give it up i want to die to it so that it no longer has that draw and no longer has that pull in my life i don't know what it is i know the things in my life that i battle with you know the things in your life that you battle with how many would raise a hand and say lord those specific things lord i want to be able to let them go i want to leave them here at the altar today and not pick them up anymore lord but arise in a newness of life letting that life that holy spirit the life of god be born in maybe be going to be be raised up in me lord you see every hand raised i've got my eyes closed because my hand is raised too to be more like you we also have to go through the death like you went through lord be willing to say not my will but thy will be done lord we've had a lot of things i've had it all but what i need lord is more of you and less of me lord siege handed his race lord this death experience is contrary to this flesh lord but the inner man this one is crying for that release lord to express jesus christ let it be for each one in jesus name of amen [Music] oh more of you [Music] i've had it all but what i
