[41:42] [Music]
[41:49] amen he's a present water he's a living
[41:55] water and if you have him in you then
[41:57] it's in you it's not someplace you have
[42:00] to go look for it go buy house but it's
[42:02] in you so appreciate that this this
[42:06] evening so we do have a couple of
[42:08] requests to bring to your attention
[42:11] our sister Martha Peterson she said to
[42:16] remember sister and Rhiannon Murray
[42:17] she's requesting prayer she's
[42:19] experienced a fever and feeling achy
[42:23] with a headache so let's remember sister
[42:27] and Rihanna and you know last Wednesday
[42:30] I believe it was with the template in a
[42:32] prayer request for his mom and when he
[42:35] got home he remembered her her body or
[42:37] her legs were hurting and when he got
[42:39] home she was standing up washing dishes
[42:40] just having a good time and she says you
[42:43] prayed for me I didn't even know God
[42:46] touched her anyway so there wherever
[42:47] sister Andriana is today we're just
[42:50] believing that and also we got news
[42:53] yesterday that a a good family friend
[42:57] passed away I don't know I know sister
[43:02] Amalia knew them and maybe some of those
[43:05] that went to the Spanish Tabernacle
[43:06] years ago a brother Frank Madrigal he
[43:09] was a mechanic and he went around
[43:11] helping everybody fix their cars and
[43:15] something happened to discourage him and
[43:18] his family and it kind of went away from
[43:20] the Lord and believe us four daughters
[43:22] and three sons and brother Frank adopted
[43:26] my dad as his as his dad here in town
[43:29] because his parents lived back in
[43:31] California and all and he they looked at
[43:34] my dad and mom as grandpa and grandma
[43:36] the kids did and Naomi their oldest
[43:39] daughter called my dad yesterday or the
[43:41] day before said dad had passed away and
[43:43] that's he had cancer it's about 65 years
[43:47] old and as I thought about him
[43:49] when we the girls were younger and they
[43:52] were getting their cars and there was a
[43:55] something wrong with it he would tell
[43:56] dad tell him to bring it over and I'll
[43:58] fix it
[43:59] he always expressed a lot of love to her
[44:02] family and considered us part of his
[44:05] family so I know that his family his
[44:08] wife and grandchildren and daughters are
[44:11] missing him strongly today Frank mother
[44:13] God is his name and let's remember them
[44:15] and if you have a need in your saying
[44:18] Lord I have a need and I'm trusting and
[44:20] believing that you know let's just bow
[44:23] our heads it and and talk to him in
[44:25] faith not in a begging pleading oh dear
[44:29] Lord I need you but Lord I just know
[44:31] that you're cool I'm confident in this I
[44:33] know in whom I have believed Lord we
[44:35] come this evening we've heard a couple
[44:38] of requests we've seen the hands raised
[44:40] and maybe there were those that didn't
[44:42] raise their hands but in their heart
[44:44] there has something and we go to a river
[44:46] that never has ever nor ever will run
[44:50] dry hard the ever-present water from the
[44:53] rock or debt is you and the mighty God
[44:56] family in Lord and sister and Rihanna
[44:58] here both Lord the needs that were were
[45:01] written and read Lord in asking you to
[45:03] be merciful in comfort in healing Lord
[45:06] and father each hand in each heart
[45:08] represented here you know what is and
[45:10] those that are listening in and maybe
[45:11] had raised their hand at home or
[45:13] wherever they might be ministered to
[45:16] each one as they as they have need Lord
[45:18] let them remember realize reacquaint
[45:22] however it is to remember that you're
[45:24] the same yesterday today and forever
[45:26] Lord we thank you for me
[45:28] we give you honor and glory and we thank
[45:31] you brother a prophet brother Graham
[45:32] taught us to thank you when we have
[45:35] asked and just to thank you for it and
[45:37] believe that it's our sword and we do
[45:39] that today
[45:40] Jesus Christ amen
[45:43] you know it's it's something when when
[45:46] you go with I hope so you're approaching
[45:50] meant will I qualify do I have enough
[45:54] but he paid a debt he took care of it
[45:57] also and speaking with brother Lyle just
[46:01] a little bit before service and I just
[46:05] had her brother man had mentioned some
[46:07] things and we had to talk in a little
[46:10] bit in him the words to this song came
[46:13] to memory we've never sung it but it's
[46:17] how big is God how big and wide his vast
[46:22] domain to try to tell my lips can only
[46:27] start he's big enough to roll this
[46:30] mighty universe yet small enough to live
[46:33] in within my heart and I thought this
[46:36] mighty God who created this whole place
[46:39] who holds it under control takes care of
[46:42] all made himself a little baby in Mary's
[46:46] womb so that he could live this life to
[46:50] understand you and me oh when I survey
[46:54] brother Peters saying that wonders cross
[46:56] do you love him today now I was going to
[47:00] honor somebody and she walked out on me
[47:04] if somebody can get sister Martha
[47:06] Peterson to come back and I'd like to to
[47:10] give honor to where honors do
[47:15] I don't know where she she walked out
[47:18] with Kenneth but she coming back in I
[47:24] was I'll start here happy to have sister
[47:30] Grace and sister Lily back and there she
[47:34] is
[47:34] I told her today if nobody else said
[47:36] thank you to her
[47:37] I wanted to appreciate her for the last
[47:39] two weeks playing the piano for us and
[47:45] she says she enjoys that and she loves
[47:48] to do it and when you listen to her you
[47:49] couldn't hardly tell could you she does
[47:52] but then sister Lily told me she said
[47:54] she appreciates so much that sister
[47:57] martha is here and confident fact she
[48:00] told me she says she should have played
[48:01] since I just got back today Joe we're
[48:05] back to service but I just wanted to say
[48:07] thank you to sister Martha and to all
[48:09] our musicians as the musicians because
[48:18] I've done it for a long time - thank you
[48:20] for you singing and responding and
[48:23] together we make joyful noise unto the
[48:27] Lord so let's stand and sister Martha I
[48:30] didn't mean to embarrass you but if I
[48:33] did I did so but thank you very much god
[48:36] bless amen so the Lord has put something
[48:39] on brother Lyle's heart and and God
[48:42] knows exactly how to deliver it and just
[48:46] take one moment of liberty I was talking
[48:49] both him and brother Peter and I
[48:51] encouraged both of them in the time
[48:53] they've administered I've tried to
[48:54] encourage them if they felt something to
[48:57] seek God's face and I was I can't say
[49:02] I'm a proud grandpa because I'm not
[49:04] really his dad or grandpa of them but I
[49:06] adopted Peter as my son adopted son when
[49:10] he came back you know brother Peter and
[49:12] brother Eddie were born and raised here
[49:15] I mean Peter said you were about 12 when
[49:17] you left somewhere around there so you
[49:18] were about 10 or so when they left they
[49:22] were they were part of the church here
[49:24] and when he came back I said I would
[49:26] take care of him and made sure he got
[49:28] fed and all and I said it was a there
[49:30] was a motive behind him I didn't want
[49:32] his dad coming after me and so he said
[49:35] he was gonna call his dad one day and he
[49:37] was gonna tell him that I wasn't
[49:38] treating him right and when brother
[49:41] Jerry got about a half an hour away he's
[49:43] in a column say I was just kidding but
[49:45] just finished coming and get him to come
[49:47] back but I've appreciated brother Peter
[49:51] in and and watched the growth and the
[49:54] expression and you know having a family
[49:57] now and all in it I told him I'd it
[49:59] wasn't me doing it but it was a glad to
[50:01] encourage him and I can say the same
[50:03] thing for brother Lyle I just tried to
[50:05] encourage them and if they have
[50:06] something and I just I'm not taking
[50:09] credit for it but I'm happy to see that
[50:11] God has done something in their lives
[50:13] and I appreciate God's goodness in
[50:15] disgrace to all of us had it not been
[50:18] somebody who reached out just took your
[50:21] hand or encourage you or gave you smile
[50:23] or lifted up you up but thank God for
[50:26] those that have done that so drawn on on
[50:29] God today and God will speak to you so

[52:04] about being your dwelling place for God
[52:06] if we could sing that one more time
[52:08] please
[52:08] [Music]
[52:14] [Music]
[52:16] I praise God
[52:19] praise God
[52:21] praise God praise God
[52:28] praise God praise God praise God
[52:39] [Music]
[52:41] our friends car
[52:44] praise
[52:50] thank you all very much as always it's a
[52:55] privilege it's an honor to be here with
[52:57] you tonight I want to thank you for
[52:59] being here whether it's physically
[53:01] through streaming or some future time
[53:03] through archiving you know we live in a
[53:06] time of unprecedented technology freedom
[53:11] of and access to information and overall
[53:14] economic prosperity were privileged to
[53:17] live in a nation that allows us to
[53:19] worship God without being directed how
[53:21] to were punished if we don't do it
[53:23] exactly that way but we also live in an
[53:27] era of unmatched skepticism toward God
[53:31] the ethics and morality of how we ought
[53:34] to live extreme peer pressure especially
[53:37] on our youth to conform to some mold
[53:40] that either ignores or rejects God one
[53:44] that at best diminishes him to a role of
[53:46] a force of the nature or politicizes
[53:50] them to advance some agenda a weapon
[53:54] often used for discounting this is
[53:58] discounting the Bible as science well my
[54:00] burden this evening is for the young
[54:02] people our topic is the reliability of
[54:05] the Bible in the face of science and the
[54:08] focus of the investigation will be the
[54:11] story of Joseph tonight and next Sunday
[54:14] evening I have a lot of material so yeah
[54:20] that's a lot and that's just tonight so
[54:23] I want to get right to it this will be
[54:26] in the form of a sunday-school lesson
[54:28] it's not preaching it's not teaching
[54:30] doctrine but sharing my heart first
[54:34] while we're still standing
[54:36] let's pray without the Lord's guidance
[54:38] without his help without him being here
[54:39] without you drawing on him we're wasting
[54:43] our time Lord were not here to waste our
[54:45] time
[54:46] Lord we've been worshipping you and song
[54:48] in and praise and in prayer and that is
[54:50] certainly no waste but Lord these next
[54:52] minutes Lord I pray that you'd help -
[54:54] scoundrel Lyle Johnson did you step
[54:56] aside Lord take control
[54:58] take control of what I say take control
[55:01] of how it said take control of how its
[55:04] heard Lord speak to us tonight we're
[55:07] depending on you we cannot do it of our
[55:10] self we thank you because we accept it
[55:14] and we believe you in Jesus name Amen
[55:17] I want to read from two portions of
[55:21] Scripture if I remember to turn this on
[55:32] looks like it's on there it is it moved
[55:37] thank you I have to be a little bit
[55:38] patient here the first verse is the
[55:42] opening verse of the entire Bible
[55:44] Genesis 1:1 in the beginning there was a
[55:48] beginning in the beginning God created
[55:51] the heaven and the earth and again from
[55:56] the end of the same book of Genesis and
[56:01] Joseph said unto his brethren I die God
[56:05] will surely visit you and bring you out
[56:08] of this land unto the land which he
[56:09] sware unto Abraham to Isaac to Jacob and
[56:12] Joseph took an oath he made the promise
[56:14] of the children of Israel saying God
[56:17] will surely visit you and he shall carry
[56:21] up my bones from hence
[56:24] so Joseph died being a hundred and ten
[56:27] years old they embalmed him he was put
[56:30] in a coffin in Egypt please be seated a
[56:36] coffin in Egypt would a strange way to
[56:38] end a book that begins with her grandeur
[56:41] in the power of God to create the
[56:43] heavens in the earth and ends with a
[56:45] tender personal note on the care of the
[56:49] body of one of his children brother
[56:53] Branham called Genesis the book of
[56:55] beginnings in fact the Hebrew name for
[56:58] the first book of the Bible but a sheet
[57:00] translated in English as Genesis is also
[57:04] the first word of the Bible that's
[57:06] translated in the beginning brother
[57:09] Branham told us in 1952 he is really the
[57:12] church he said now the book of Genesis
[57:14] is the seed chapter of the Bible it's
[57:18] the beginning to where Genesis means the
[57:20] beginning three nights later he said
[57:22] I've been studying Genesis now for two
[57:24] years
[57:25] it's the beginning to going forth the
[57:28] same chapter
[57:30] have you ever wondered why Genesis 15
[57:33] chapters the foundation of the entire
[57:36] Bible the beginning of it all
[57:39] two votes 13 of those chapters more than
[57:43] 1/4 of its entire content to the life of
[57:47] Joseph Joseph I've been thinking as I
[57:52] mentioned the burden of the young people
[57:53] about our graduates this year in 2020
[57:56] students in high school going on to
[57:58] university the pressures that they face
[58:01] in our modern Western society a society
[58:05] replete with attitudes that dismiss and
[58:08] ignore or even ridicule and condemn our
[58:11] faith a society with education thrust
[58:15] focused on science technology
[58:17] engineering mathematics again our topic
[58:22] is the reliability of the Bible its
[58:26] historic accuracy the title for this
[58:30] evenings portion is Joseph's foundation
[58:34] I think if we want to be honest with
[58:36] ourselves with each other with our
[58:38] children we have to ask the question how
[58:40] trustworthy really is the Bible in this
[58:44] age of modern science does does pure
[58:47] science contradict objective biblical
[58:50] narrative as were often told or are they
[58:53] actually complimentary with each
[58:56] supporting and reinforcing the other
[58:59] now when I say pure science I'm talking
[59:02] about investigative and experimental
[59:04] results I'm not talking about somebody's
[59:06] interpretation well this means that or
[59:07] that happened because I'm talking about
[59:10] the observation itself that to the
[59:13] extent possible science that's stripped
[59:15] of the biases of the scientists if I say
[59:18] objective biblical narrative I'm not
[59:20] talking about somebody's commentary
[59:21] somebody's interpretation somebody's
[59:23] feeling about what something means but
[59:26] to the extent possible the biblical text
[59:30] stripped of the biases of the reader as
[59:33] well as of the translator given that the
[59:37] foundational text of the Bible
[59:40] is Genisys what about its historical
[59:44] reliability and that for the story of
[59:47] Joseph's Joseph's specifically to say
[59:49] well brother while why are you picking
[59:52] Joseph well in addition to occupying
[59:56] more than a quarter of the entire book
[59:59] of Genesis the story is filled with
[1:00:02] meticulous attention to detail Joseph's
[1:00:06] story lists a large number of events
[1:00:08] spread over many years it gives us a
[1:00:12] unique opportunity to investigate the
[1:00:15] historical and cultural content against
[1:00:17] history and science because these are
[1:00:20] the tools the weapons that will be used
[1:00:22] against our young people
[1:00:23] I really appreciated brother Matt's
[1:00:26] message this morning about the precision
[1:00:28] of the Bible regarding the wilderness
[1:00:31] Tabernacle if you're building something
[1:00:32] you've got to follow the blueprints
[1:00:34] including the fine print the footnotes
[1:00:37] vague descriptions and references won't
[1:00:40] cut it my pastor said I heard no that's
[1:00:44] not good the details are important they
[1:00:46] can mean the difference between success
[1:00:47] and failure a solid building a one that
[1:00:51] collapses under pressure Paul tells us
[1:00:56] and first Thessalonians he says prove
[1:00:59] that means test test all things test
[1:01:02] everything hold fast to that which is
[1:01:05] good that which survives the testing
[1:01:08] well this begs the question what can we
[1:01:12] test how can we test it apart from the
[1:01:19] Genesis narrative itself are there
[1:01:22] historical records or archaeological or
[1:01:24] other scientific evidence that we can
[1:01:27] use to support or that calls into
[1:01:30] question we have to be even-handed we
[1:01:33] have to be fair calls into question the
[1:01:35] biblical account Peter tells us sanctify
[1:01:39] the Lord God in your hearts be ready
[1:01:42] always be prepared
[1:01:45] at all times to give an answer to every
[1:01:48] man that asks you don't push but respond
[1:01:51] a reason for the hope that faith
[1:01:54] evidence of the hope that is in you with
[1:01:58] meekness that's gentleness backed by
[1:02:02] strength and fear this is not teller but
[1:02:06] respect reason don't argue or let me
[1:02:08] tell you something
[1:02:09] no no respect don't talk past each other
[1:02:13] we see so much about today have a
[1:02:15] conversation engage in humility and
[1:02:18] respect meekness is not weakness it's
[1:02:22] not temerity Jesus was meek he was near
[1:02:24] too weak nor timid in st. Matthew's
[1:02:28] Gospel chapter 22 Jesus quotes Moses
[1:02:31] when he's asked master what is the great
[1:02:34] commandment in the law jesus said thou
[1:02:39] shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
[1:02:42] heart with all thy soul and with all thy
[1:02:46] mind love the Lord with all your mind
[1:02:50] the battleground is in the mind we
[1:02:53] touched on that when we spoke last time
[1:02:55] here Paul the one who told us to test
[1:02:58] everything he tells us in Timothy
[1:02:59] studied but that means invest time
[1:03:03] effort study to show thyself approved
[1:03:06] unto God not approved to yourself not to
[1:03:09] your peers
[1:03:10] a workman we're talking about work
[1:03:13] effort not vacation it's work your
[1:03:17] mission should you decide to accept it
[1:03:19] that needeth not to be ashamed rightly
[1:03:22] dividing the word of truth but shun
[1:03:26] profane and vain babblings just arguing
[1:03:28] and talking past each other they'll
[1:03:30] increase it to more ungodliness strife
[1:03:32] angers discontent
[1:03:34] you got a study you got to take it in
[1:03:38] you've got to own it make it yours
[1:03:42] or don't accept the mission and prepare
[1:03:44] to be ashamed I don't have an answer go
[1:03:46] talk to my pastor unable to answer
[1:03:49] unable to give a reason
[1:03:52] Joseph do science and history provide
[1:03:57] evidence to support or do they
[1:03:59] contradict the biblical text of course
[1:04:04] we're not gonna find a blood stoked torn
[1:04:08] multicolored garment and Rita a label
[1:04:11] that's engraved in or embroidered
[1:04:12] somehow that says oh this coat was a
[1:04:14] property of Joseph son of Jacob resident
[1:04:17] of Canaan 1900 BC no we're not gonna
[1:04:21] find that we're not going to discover a
[1:04:23] cache of credit-card bills or bank
[1:04:25] transactions in his name we can't go to
[1:04:27] Syria or Iraq and check the Bureau of
[1:04:30] Vital Statistics and pull a copy of his
[1:04:31] birth certificate for the Mathew we
[1:04:35] won't find his passport with a visa
[1:04:37] stamp saying they entered Egypt on
[1:04:39] such-and-such a day is a foreign worker
[1:04:40] no neither will we locate a bill of sale
[1:04:43] for one battered Canaanite teenager
[1:04:47] named Joseph if we go to Midian and a
[1:04:50] station alight spice traders we're not
[1:04:53] going to find a receipt for him in the
[1:04:54] slave markets of Egypt no we have to
[1:04:57] look someplace else if we could find any
[1:05:00] of these things if we could how would we
[1:05:02] know they're not forgeries how could you
[1:05:05] be certain what we will be able to do
[1:05:09] has established the context and then
[1:05:11] looked for and examine evidence that
[1:05:14] supports or refutes the biblical account
[1:05:19] we have to recognize that if you're
[1:05:22] given evidence different detectives may
[1:05:24] come to different conclusions based on
[1:05:25] the same evidence their conclusions may
[1:05:28] be biased so might ours let's be honest
[1:05:33] we often see what we want to see we find
[1:05:35] what we want to find we see that all
[1:05:39] around us these days with protests about
[1:05:41] racial inequality or theories about the
[1:05:43] origin of the novel coronavirus
[1:05:46] brother Branham told us that when you
[1:05:48] come to a meeting you get what you came
[1:05:50] looking for
[1:05:51] do you expect to hear from God is that
[1:05:54] why you came tonight you will expect to
[1:05:59] hear some guy rambling on about
[1:06:00] something you really could care less
[1:06:02] about or something to criticize that's
[1:06:05] what you're gonna find it's often hard
[1:06:08] to recognize much less separate
[1:06:10] ourselves from our biases but biases are
[1:06:17] not there is objective truth and we'll
[1:06:19] find that in the Bible as well but for
[1:06:22] example let's just say that the
[1:06:24] temperature in this room is 74 degrees
[1:06:26] okay we can measure that it's subjective
[1:06:30] now we might question the calibration of
[1:06:32] the thermometer but we can agree that
[1:06:34] within the accuracy of the thermometer
[1:06:36] that it's 74 degrees and even if we
[1:06:40] can't agree if somebody says huh I think
[1:06:42] it's 87 and somebody else said oh I'm
[1:06:45] pretty sure it's 62 that doesn't change
[1:06:47] the fact that it's 74 now you might say
[1:06:52] it's too cold I might say I feel a
[1:06:54] little warm those are other
[1:06:56] interpretations of the temperature those
[1:06:58] reflect our biases and our preferences
[1:07:00] but they don't change the temperature
[1:07:03] well in a similar way as we gather
[1:07:06] evidence from the Bible and from other
[1:07:08] sources to the course of this evening
[1:07:11] and next Sunday evening we need to
[1:07:13] recognize biases we need to evaluate
[1:07:16] these things not be selective not avoid
[1:07:19] the hard questions well before we can
[1:07:22] search for witnesses outside the Bible
[1:07:25] to substantiate or refute the Joseph
[1:07:29] story we have to determine when did he
[1:07:32] live we have to establish his place in
[1:07:35] the timeline of history his
[1:07:37] chronological context so that's what
[1:07:42] we'll start now the Bible text doesn't
[1:07:45] explicitly say Joseph was born in 1843
[1:07:48] ad or 29:17 BC er that it doesn't say
[1:07:52] that 25 years ago a little personal note
[1:07:56] I worked with several people from Japan
[1:07:58] I asked one of these friends from Japan
[1:08:02] when were you born you scratched his
[1:08:07] head for a few minutes and then he told
[1:08:10] me he had to think about why did he have
[1:08:12] to think about it the Japanese calendar
[1:08:17] is based on the reign of the current
[1:08:19] Emperor Hirohito for example rain from
[1:08:22] 1926 to 1989 this is known as the Showa
[1:08:26] era if my friend would have said I was
[1:08:29] born in Showa 33 wouldn't a man anything
[1:08:32] to me he knew that so he did the math to
[1:08:36] tell me when he was born but if he'd
[1:08:38] have said Showa 33 in and I knew to add
[1:08:41] 1925 to it then I'd realized a brother
[1:08:43] Aaron that he was born in 1958 have to
[1:08:48] do a little math based on the context of
[1:08:50] his statement to me in order to move it
[1:08:52] from the calendar of his culture to the
[1:08:56] calendar of mine while we're talking
[1:09:00] calendars up I'll suggest don't give too
[1:09:02] much weight to the dates that you find
[1:09:04] in the margins of your Bibles these are
[1:09:06] typically derived from a fellow
[1:09:08] archbishop named uh sure published back
[1:09:10] in 1654 there the years that are for
[1:09:14] example in the Scofield Bible I sure did
[1:09:17] the best he could with the data that he
[1:09:20] had in 1650 three hundred and seventy
[1:09:24] years later we have more data we can get
[1:09:27] more accurate well our modern calendar
[1:09:30] the one we use today is known as the
[1:09:32] Gregorian calendar it was named after
[1:09:34] Pope Gregory the 13th who introduced it
[1:09:37] on October the 4th 1580 - you don't have
[1:09:40] to remember that date this calendar
[1:09:42] includes leap years and it fine Tunes
[1:09:45] them to align as closely as practical
[1:09:47] with the solar year as it was understood
[1:09:49] in 1582 nowadays we not only have leap
[1:09:54] years we even insert leap seconds in
[1:09:56] order to get our clocks and our
[1:09:58] calendars is accurate because we know
[1:10:00] how to make them you can be sure that in
[1:10:03] Joseph's time and Moses time they didn't
[1:10:06] know how to measure things as accurately
[1:10:08] there was no world standard for
[1:10:10] calendars all of which makes determining
[1:10:13] dates and ancient times
[1:10:15] challenging exercise some people devote
[1:10:17] their lives to solving these puzzles
[1:10:21] where do we begin well Jesus gives us a
[1:10:26] clue whosoever cometh to me and heareth
[1:10:30] my sayings and do with them
[1:10:32] I'll show you whom he's like here we go
[1:10:35] he's like a man which built in house and
[1:10:37] digged deep and laid the foundation on a
[1:10:41] rock when the flood rose a stream beat
[1:10:45] vehemently against that house it was
[1:10:47] stood it was founded on a rock nothing
[1:10:50] could shake it but he that heareth and
[1:10:52] doeth not is like a man that without a
[1:10:55] foundation just started building
[1:10:57] magnificent beautiful house same as the
[1:10:59] other one but when the stream hit it
[1:11:02] it's gone knocked over couldn't
[1:11:05] withstand it the old testament is
[1:11:08] anchored in time it's time foundation
[1:11:12] it's the exodus that amazing spring day
[1:11:16] that began on the evening of the
[1:11:18] Passover and ended with a nation
[1:11:21] descended from Jacob walking out in
[1:11:23] broad daylight out of Egypt out of
[1:11:26] slavery out of captivity we read in
[1:11:30] Exodus 12 the sojourning of the children
[1:11:34] of Israel who dwelt in Egypt not just
[1:11:36] visiting wasn't a holiday the soul
[1:11:40] journey was quite a long time might have
[1:11:42] been a few centuries even is that what
[1:11:45] it says no no the Bible specifies us
[1:11:49] very precisely it says it was 430 years
[1:11:53] that's something we can measure maybe
[1:11:56] that's something we can test it came to
[1:11:59] pass at the end of the 430 years there
[1:12:02] it is again
[1:12:03] wasn't a mistake it wasn't a misprint
[1:12:06] it's being said twice even the self same
[1:12:09] day it's not a lot of wiggle room there
[1:12:12] it came to pass that all the hosts of
[1:12:15] the Lord went out from the land of Egypt
[1:12:18] well there hasn't been found any record
[1:12:21] in Egypt of the arrival of this
[1:12:23] Canaanite clan so we don't know when
[1:12:26] this was
[1:12:27] now another reference in Genesis God he
[1:12:32] the Lord said to Abram know of a surety
[1:12:34] that thy seed your descendants will be a
[1:12:36] stranger in a land that is not theirs
[1:12:38] and shall serve them and they shall
[1:12:41] afflict them longer than they like no
[1:12:46] it's precise it says they'll serve them
[1:12:48] for hundred years
[1:12:50] that's another pretty definite number
[1:12:53] and that nation whom they shall serve
[1:12:55] will I judge and afterward they shall
[1:12:57] come out with great substance that's the
[1:12:59] Exodus this is an advert I point to the
[1:13:02] Exodus well nobody has found and
[1:13:06] revealed any way that they've discovered
[1:13:07] a record or Egypt of a date when on this
[1:13:10] day ferrozzo and so made all the Hebrew
[1:13:12] slaves we don't have that so and there's
[1:13:16] there's not a discrepancy between the
[1:13:18] four hundred years and the four hundred
[1:13:20] thirty years they lived in Egypt for 30
[1:13:22] years before their immigration status of
[1:13:25] temporary resident was revoked well
[1:13:27] we'll talk about that next week but
[1:13:29] let's go forward in time then from the
[1:13:31] Exodus if we can't find something back
[1:13:33] to see what we can find first King six
[1:13:38] and it came to pass after maybe 200 or
[1:13:41] 500 years no no it doesn't say that it
[1:13:45] came to pass in the four hundred and
[1:13:47] eightieth year not after four hundred
[1:13:50] and eighty years in the four hundred
[1:13:52] eightieth year you can hang your hat on
[1:13:55] it after the children of Israel will
[1:13:57] come out of the land of Egypt
[1:13:59] that's the Exodus in the fourth year of
[1:14:03] Solomon's reign over Israel and not just
[1:14:05] a fourth year but in the second month he
[1:14:07] began to build the house of the Lord he
[1:14:09] was laying a foundation Solomon's Temple
[1:14:14] construction date isn't known in secular
[1:14:17] history but we do have definite evidence
[1:14:20] that he did build a temple Egyptian
[1:14:24] history was recorded from papaya in
[1:14:26] Temple and tomb inscriptions and stalee
[1:14:29] and so forth own records victories
[1:14:32] there's nothing about the exodus
[1:14:35] Egyptologists like that Professor Bob
[1:14:37] Brier that Heather and I took to
[1:14:39] 48 less lecture course while we were
[1:14:42] during our stay home stay safe period a
[1:14:44] couple of months ago he told us quote
[1:14:47] the ancient Egyptians didn't record
[1:14:49] defeats they had a different conception
[1:14:52] of history than we do so you won't find
[1:14:55] a record of this defeat much less when
[1:14:57] it happened recorded in Egyptian history
[1:15:00] we'll have to try and find it's another
[1:15:02] way well what's going on what's going on
[1:15:06] could God be giving us something to test
[1:15:09] and hold fast if it's true with these
[1:15:12] precise durations of 480 430 and 400
[1:15:18] years something to help us hang on to
[1:15:21] under unwavering attacks on the book
[1:15:23] that forms the foundation of our faith
[1:15:25] we're building a foundation now it's
[1:15:29] strange the foundation in time for
[1:15:32] Genesis is found in Exodus now as we go
[1:15:39] forward here we're gonna be getting a
[1:15:40] little bit technical I can't avoid it
[1:15:42] skeptics aren't gonna accept a hand
[1:15:45] waving argument they want something that
[1:15:48] they can research something they can
[1:15:49] evaluate frankly
[1:15:52] so should we now if there's no record
[1:15:55] outside the Bible for the Exodus and
[1:15:57] there's no link in the Bible tying the
[1:16:00] date of the exodus of something we know
[1:16:02] in secular history like there was a
[1:16:05] giant meteor that struck and killed all
[1:16:07] the dinosaurs or something then we have
[1:16:10] to find another specific event that we
[1:16:12] can reliably tie to the exodus we just
[1:16:16] read one the laying of the foundation of
[1:16:20] Solomon's Temple when was this
[1:16:25] fortunately an historic event occurred
[1:16:28] very near the time when the temple was
[1:16:30] built the Bible lists that event and
[1:16:33] it's also attested to in secular history
[1:16:36] confirmed by archaeology and and other
[1:16:38] things and there's two accounts of this
[1:16:40] in the Bible let's read first Kings 14
[1:16:42] that came to pass and the fifth year of
[1:16:46] King Rehoboam that Shishak king of Egypt
[1:16:50] came up against Jerusalem
[1:16:52] ah let's read the same account a little
[1:16:56] more detail and chronicles it came to
[1:16:58] pass it in the fifth year of King
[1:17:00] Rehoboam we've got two witnesses here
[1:17:02] that Shishak king of egypt came up
[1:17:05] against jerusalem because they
[1:17:07] transgressed against the lord with
[1:17:08] twelve hundred chariots and threescore
[1:17:10] thousand horsemen and the people were
[1:17:13] without number that came with him out of
[1:17:14] Egypt these folks from these different
[1:17:18] places right
[1:17:18] and he took defense cities the walled
[1:17:21] cities that belonged to Judah and he
[1:17:25] came to Jerusalem we have a name shishak
[1:17:30] it doesn't just say Pharoah like the
[1:17:32] president or the king we have a name
[1:17:35] it's the first pharaoh that's actually
[1:17:38] named in the Bible
[1:17:40] how convenient just when we need it the
[1:17:43] linkage is once again tied to Egypt
[1:17:47] first the exodus from Egypt now an
[1:17:50] invasion of Judah by Egypt we learned
[1:17:53] from the chronicler that Shishak took
[1:17:55] the walled cities of Judah and then came
[1:17:57] to Jerusalem if if you read the further
[1:18:01] text in these two accounts you'll see
[1:18:03] that Rio Boehm ransomed to Jerusalem and
[1:18:05] she shacked it and destroy the city well
[1:18:08] Raya Boehm is one of Solomon's kids one
[1:18:11] of his children we can pin down his
[1:18:13] reign relative to Solomon's the time
[1:18:16] that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over
[1:18:18] all Israel was 40 years and Solomon
[1:18:22] slept with his fathers he passed away he
[1:18:24] was buried in the City of David his
[1:18:26] father and Rayo bow of his son reigned
[1:18:28] in his stead ah we've got something we
[1:18:32] can synchronize to here we can go to
[1:18:36] shacks invasion if we can figure out
[1:18:38] when that is hint we can and go back
[1:18:41] five years from that to the end of
[1:18:44] solomon's reign the beginning array of
[1:18:45] booms go back 40 years from that to the
[1:18:48] beginning of solomon's reign and then go
[1:18:49] up four years within solomon's reign to
[1:18:53] laying the foundation to the temple sad
[1:18:57] a little confusing it would have been
[1:19:00] just a whole lot easier if somebody
[1:19:02] would've just use
[1:19:03] accurate consistent solar calendar but
[1:19:07] where's the fun in that I hope you can
[1:19:11] see that that little timeline that I did
[1:19:14] for you because I really worked hard so
[1:19:15] I want you to be able to see it but but
[1:19:18] but here's a timeline I do to help you
[1:19:19] put all this in perspective now since
[1:19:21] we're dealing with years BC before
[1:19:24] Christ according to Pope Gregory the
[1:19:26] numbers increased the further back in
[1:19:28] time we go so that's why the arrow
[1:19:29] points to the left now I put an anchor
[1:19:33] symbol I think this thing has uh maybe
[1:19:40] it's I got to figure out how to use it
[1:19:42] it's got a laser on it somewhere the
[1:19:46] green button you're right it's the green
[1:19:48] button okay we have confirmation we have
[1:19:50] two witnesses okay so I put an anchor
[1:19:54] symbol up here by the invasion of
[1:19:56] Jerusalem because that's our anchor into
[1:19:58] secular history and I put an anchor here
[1:20:01] at the Exodus because that's the anchor
[1:20:04] of time in the entire Old Testament it's
[1:20:06] the time foundation well you say well
[1:20:08] that's nice by the while I still don't
[1:20:10] know what it was oh oh sorry I put some
[1:20:14] ears in here to make it a little bit
[1:20:16] easier okay it's the same information
[1:20:18] but with our channel interstates shishak
[1:20:21] of the Bible is show shank one of
[1:20:23] secular history two ways of stating the
[1:20:26] same person's name you've got to
[1:20:27] understand this guy's name certain
[1:20:29] Egyptian hieroglyphics and it's
[1:20:30] translated into Hebrew or Aramaic or
[1:20:32] into Greek and then finally into English
[1:20:34] and the Spelling's kind of diverged a
[1:20:36] little bit it's the same guy okay and
[1:20:39] and don't worry there won't be a test in
[1:20:42] fact at the back of the church I've got
[1:20:44] this timeline and a couple of other bits
[1:20:46] of information some notes for you to
[1:20:48] take with you if you wish after service
[1:20:50] it's just one side of one page next week
[1:20:53] we'll get the second side filled in so
[1:20:56] but I don't want to put all that
[1:20:58] information in this time you might not
[1:21:00] come back next week so there's not going
[1:21:03] to be a test okay as might be expected
[1:21:06] the evidence for show shanks invasion
[1:21:10] is anchored in history by archeology the
[1:21:14] major item is an engraving on a wall
[1:21:17] that's part of the booba site portal and
[1:21:19] gate located in Karnak which is an
[1:21:22] ancient Egyptian temple complex it's a
[1:21:24] place where pharaohs routinely boasted
[1:21:27] of their accomplishments and stone
[1:21:28] carvings so that no one would forget the
[1:21:30] portal lists a number of towns in Israel
[1:21:33] and Judah that show Schenk conquered but
[1:21:37] it doesn't list Jerusalem the Bible
[1:21:39] lists Jerusalem and how robomen ago she
[1:21:42] aided it not being captured
[1:21:44] so this lies perfectly he was there he
[1:21:49] tripped a lot of walled cities he did
[1:21:51] not take Jerusalem because Jerusalem was
[1:21:53] ransomed so we have very good
[1:21:56] synchronisation here between history and
[1:21:58] the Bible and and there's also a little
[1:22:02] stone fragment here of something called
[1:22:03] a stellae which is just a stone slab
[1:22:06] that these guys had he wrecked to say
[1:22:08] look what I did okay this one is found
[1:22:11] they tell Megiddo tel is an old mound
[1:22:15] that's left over from a place where
[1:22:16] people used to live and they got tired
[1:22:18] moved somewhere else
[1:22:19] so until Megiddo in Israel this fragment
[1:22:23] lists show shanks name and and a little
[1:22:25] part of fragment of a typical fir onyx
[1:22:28] statement of how glorious he was but its
[1:22:31] presence buried within the town of
[1:22:33] Megiddo indicates that he was there and
[1:22:35] they're north of modern Israel
[1:22:38] so show shanks invasion was a 925 BC
[1:22:44] that year of 925 is attested to by
[1:22:47] multiple sources
[1:22:49] lots of people whether they believe the
[1:22:51] Bible or they don't it's considered very
[1:22:53] reliable so this implies then that the
[1:22:56] date of the temple construction was 966
[1:22:59] okay now the 966 date it fits plus or
[1:23:03] minus a year why because it says in the
[1:23:05] fifth year of Raya bowl was it the fifth
[1:23:07] year and one day
[1:23:08] was it the fifth year and 360 days it
[1:23:11] was somewhere in there so there's a
[1:23:13] little uncertainty when the Bible says
[1:23:15] Solomon reigned for forty years was it
[1:23:17] 40 years in zero days was at 40 years in
[1:23:19] six months was the 39 years and ten
[1:23:21] months and just rounded to 40 years we
[1:23:23] really No so there's a little bit of
[1:23:26] uncertainty here but we'll use 966 if
[1:23:31] you're going back 3,000 years
[1:23:33] that's pretty precise well this then
[1:23:37] places the exodus where we've been
[1:23:38] trying to get to all this time
[1:23:41] 14:46 BC that's the anchor for the Old
[1:23:45] Testament 1446 B see if that's true
[1:23:49] Jacob and his family then joined Joseph
[1:23:52] four hundred and thirty years sooner in
[1:23:56] 1876 BC that's going to prove to be a
[1:23:59] very important date so again I place the
[1:24:03] anchor an exodus at 14:46 we go back in
[1:24:06] time to jacob we go forward in time to
[1:24:08] the temple because the exodus is an
[1:24:13] event and a date where there's a lot of
[1:24:14] skepticism controversy misunderstanding
[1:24:18] and because it's the anchor and it's so
[1:24:20] important within christianity in the
[1:24:22] secular world were going to spend some
[1:24:24] time on that now
[1:24:25] solomon the one who built the temple he
[1:24:29] admonishes us we've read in proverbs 25
[1:24:34] these are also Proverbs of Solomon which
[1:24:38] the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied
[1:24:40] out so this was added into the list of
[1:24:42] Proverbs and Hezekiah steamed about 200
[1:24:45] years after Solomon's time that weren't
[1:24:47] written down at Solomon's fine according
[1:24:49] to this note let's get on with it it is
[1:24:52] the glory of God to conceal a thing
[1:24:57] God's not gonna spoon feed us he expects
[1:25:00] us to grow up but it's the honor of
[1:25:03] kings to search out a matter sort of
[1:25:08] like study to show thyself approved to
[1:25:11] God or test all things ork jesus said
[1:25:15] Luke 11:9
[1:25:17] seek and ye shall find what are you
[1:25:20] gonna find if you don't seek not a lot
[1:25:24] so like an archaeologist we have to be
[1:25:27] prepared to dig like a scientist or a
[1:25:30] Christian we have to test and in our
[1:25:34] case trust the Holy Spirit to
[1:25:37] in the right direction as I mentioned
[1:25:40] we're going to be spending actually the
[1:25:42] remainder of this evening on exodus
[1:25:44] verifying it's date and the things
[1:25:46] around it from outside the Bible as well
[1:25:48] as in the Bible to help us nail that
[1:25:51] date down well brother while it's gonna
[1:25:54] take a while can't we just skip all that
[1:25:56] ad 430 and 480 come up with 910 back
[1:26:00] that off from the construction of the
[1:26:01] temple and get on with Joe no no we
[1:26:05] can't because the Bible doesn't do that
[1:26:07] the Bible answers anchors it to exodus
[1:26:10] that's the anchor the the the Hebrew
[1:26:14] calendar when these guys left Egypt what
[1:26:17] did God tell them in exodus 12 to let
[1:26:19] this month be the first month of buts
[1:26:21] for you
[1:26:21] they started everything it's all
[1:26:23] synchronized to the exodus so we have to
[1:26:27] confirm if we don't confirm the exodus
[1:26:30] and that 480 years that we want to go
[1:26:33] back or the 430 years it's just a number
[1:26:35] that's just a number it's as good as any
[1:26:37] other number take your pick
[1:26:39] well foundations are necessarily
[1:26:42] time-consuming to lay some of the work
[1:26:45] just gets tedious but Jesus reminded us
[1:26:50] if the Foundation's weak building's not
[1:26:52] going to stand it'll collapse
[1:26:55] well we want a solid foundation if we're
[1:26:58] gonna go out and confront the world and
[1:27:00] have these people hammering at us with
[1:27:01] science coming from this direction and
[1:27:03] that we have to have a solid foundation
[1:27:06] so let's do it Paul told us to test
[1:27:11] proof all things he's he didn't suggest
[1:27:13] it he didn't say by the way if you have
[1:27:17] time you might want to consider this is
[1:27:18] a New Testament commandment we need to
[1:27:21] find things in the biblical account that
[1:27:23] we can test against science and history
[1:27:26] and archaeology to confirm or invalidate
[1:27:29] what that this happened in 1446 since
[1:27:33] Egyptians don't like to record defeats
[1:27:35] we don't Rock kind of find a record of
[1:27:37] by the way under this pharaoh there were
[1:27:39] a lot of frogs in the mosquitoes be just
[1:27:41] really bad and then it got dark and then
[1:27:43] the river turned to blood we're not
[1:27:45] gonna find that it's not there so let's
[1:27:48] listen
[1:27:48] the events that are listed in the Bible
[1:27:51] for which we might be able to find some
[1:27:53] evidence to help us test the state well
[1:27:58] brother Peter I came up with six on my
[1:28:00] list the the Pharaoh at Moses birth had
[1:28:06] a daughter that's something we might be
[1:28:09] able to confirm the Pharaoh at the
[1:28:11] Exodus had Hebrew slaves that made mud
[1:28:14] bricks with straw okay the Pharaoh when
[1:28:18] Moses was forty somehow failed to
[1:28:20] execute Moses who was wanted for
[1:28:22] murdering an Egyptian official hmm the
[1:28:27] firstborn of the Pharaoh of the Exodus
[1:28:29] died never made it to the throne the
[1:28:32] Pharaoh would the Exodus rode in a
[1:28:34] chariot - damn chariots then did he
[1:28:37] cheat at chariots the Pharaoh of the
[1:28:39] exodus is likely to have drowned in the
[1:28:41] Red Sea oh well since Pharaoh is a title
[1:28:46] like President or King we have no name
[1:28:48] for the Pharaoh of the exodus in the
[1:28:50] biblical account so we have to determine
[1:28:52] if we can who was the pharaoh in 1446 BC
[1:28:57] well Egyptian history we find lists of
[1:29:01] pharaohs but their reigns how long it
[1:29:04] that's all a little soft it's a little
[1:29:06] mushy it's it's it's it it's hard to
[1:29:10] know for sure it's like trying to pick
[1:29:12] up well like to try to pick up a water
[1:29:16] balloon or something that's uh that's
[1:29:17] not too full understand that serious
[1:29:21] Egyptology the study of Egyptian history
[1:29:23] the ability to decipher hieroglyphics
[1:29:25] and read these things on the walls and
[1:29:27] Karnak this holy began with the
[1:29:29] discovery of the Rosetta Stone when
[1:29:31] Napoleon invaded Egypt in 1799 it's only
[1:29:34] been a little over 200 years that
[1:29:36] anybody has been able to read this
[1:29:38] Egyptian stuff anyway
[1:29:41] similarly archaeology only changed from
[1:29:44] the Indiana Jones style of treasure
[1:29:46] hunting to trying to understand the
[1:29:49] times in the context starting about the
[1:29:51] mid 19th century also just about 200
[1:29:54] years
[1:29:55] well it turns out that 1446 BC falls in
[1:29:59] the time of what is known as 18th
[1:30:01] dynasty during a period known as the New
[1:30:04] Kingdom in Egyptian history the Pharaoh
[1:30:07] in 1446 BC I get to keep hammering that
[1:30:10] date I'm sorry but maybe I'm not sorry
[1:30:12] Bella keep hammering it anyway seems to
[1:30:14] be universally agreed as being a guy
[1:30:17] named Chuck Moses the third well there's
[1:30:21] a problem
[1:30:23] many of you have seemed sussel be Tamils
[1:30:26] 1956 classic movie The Ten Commandments
[1:30:30] the Pharaohs portrayed as being ram
[1:30:33] assists the second ram assists the great
[1:30:35] tradition often if not usually
[1:30:38] identifies her I missus a second is the
[1:30:41] Pharaoh at the time of Moses well what's
[1:30:43] the problem he reigned from about 1279
[1:30:46] to about 1213 BC that's not 1446 that's
[1:30:52] an error of about two hundred years of
[1:30:54] the Bible statement of 480 years before
[1:30:57] the temple foundation is to be believed
[1:30:59] well what's correct was at 480 years
[1:31:03] what was it Rama sees what's going on we
[1:31:10] read an exodus therefore they did set
[1:31:12] over them task masters to afflict them
[1:31:14] with their burdens they weren't very
[1:31:16] nice and they built for pharaoh treasure
[1:31:19] cities pick tall men Ramis
[1:31:22] or numbers 33 they departed from ram
[1:31:26] isis in the first month on the fifteenth
[1:31:29] day of the first month on the morrow
[1:31:32] after the passover the children Vizier
[1:31:33] went out with a high hand in the slate
[1:31:35] of all the Egyptians what's the problem
[1:31:40] there was no city named Ramius in 1446
[1:31:44] BC
[1:31:46] it was given this name by ravishes
[1:31:49] therefore the reason it goes the Exodus
[1:31:51] had to happen under a missus or even
[1:31:53] later
[1:31:54] so the 480 years is incorrect the
[1:31:58] Bible's unreliable itself contradictory
[1:32:00] got you throw it out not so fast
[1:32:05] cities and towns get name changes from
[1:32:07] time to time
[1:32:08] I remember Heather and I we saw the Twin
[1:32:12] Towers of the World Trade Center in 2000
[1:32:14] when we were in New Amsterdam
[1:32:16] I mean Manhattan I was at New York City
[1:32:22] city and place names may change at some
[1:32:25] time during the writing or copying of
[1:32:27] the scroll of Exodus the scribe may have
[1:32:30] replaced the name of the town Moses
[1:32:32] departed from with the name of the town
[1:32:33] or city that the readers of that day
[1:32:35] would recognize ram uses Justin mean it
[1:32:39] was called by that name at the time of
[1:32:40] the Exodus now there's definite evidence
[1:32:42] that scribes did this sort of thing to
[1:32:45] help clarify it but for example Genesis
[1:32:47] 23 Sarah was a hundred and seven and
[1:32:50] twenty years old these were the years of
[1:32:51] the life of Sarah and Sarah died in Cuba
[1:32:54] the same as Hepburn in the land of
[1:32:56] Canaan and Abraham came to mourn for
[1:32:58] Sarah and to mourn for her weep for her
[1:33:01] here we see that Sarah was buried in
[1:33:03] Korea album the town was later renamed
[1:33:07] Hebron at the time that Genesis was
[1:33:09] committed to writing or when it was
[1:33:11] later copied the notation that it was
[1:33:13] now known as heaven was included and
[1:33:15] Abraham's time when he buried Sarah he'd
[1:33:17] never heard of everyone it was carrion
[1:33:19] agua well the same principle applies to
[1:33:22] the city a place called rye mrs. Jacob
[1:33:25] comes to Joseph we think from our
[1:33:27] timeline in 1876 BC and any event
[1:33:31] regardless of whether you think it was
[1:33:32] Ramius or not it was hundreds of years
[1:33:35] before the exodus and therefore had to
[1:33:38] have been hundreds of years before Bram
[1:33:40] uses so say brother Lyle scribes may
[1:33:50] have
[1:33:51] come on really that that's a little weak
[1:33:53] don't you have anything better than that
[1:33:55] oh I'm glad you asked yeah as a matter
[1:33:57] of fact the Bible let's get back to
[1:34:01] Joseph's story or get back to it the one
[1:34:03] that we hope to get to right pharaoh
[1:34:05] spake unto joseph saying thy father and
[1:34:07] thy brethren or come unto thee okay
[1:34:09] we're saying this is 1876 and it's
[1:34:11] certainly well before the time of Ramses
[1:34:13] the land of Egypt is before thee and the
[1:34:18] best of the land make thy father rather
[1:34:21] to dwell in the land of Goshen let them
[1:34:24] dwell if thou knowest any men have
[1:34:26] activity among them make them rulers
[1:34:28] over my cattle you know any Cowboys okay
[1:34:33] what do we have going on here so Pharaoh
[1:34:37] Pharaoh Pharaohs commandment sorry wrong
[1:34:43] button and the land of Goshen let them
[1:34:46] dwell that's what Pharoah said yes no
[1:34:50] yes okay good I'm glad you agree let's
[1:34:53] go to the next verse a couple of verses
[1:34:56] later Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out
[1:34:59] for before Pharaoh and Joseph places
[1:35:01] father his brethren that gave him a
[1:35:03] possession in the land of Egypt and the
[1:35:04] best of the land and the land of Ramy
[1:35:07] seized this Pharaoh had commanded I
[1:35:10] thought he said I thought we just read
[1:35:13] it
[1:35:13] it was Goshen Bram II seized the land of
[1:35:19] ramasees did not exist as that name
[1:35:22] hundreds of years before Rama seized it
[1:35:25] didn't this area known as Goshen was in
[1:35:28] the Nile Delta it was not Rama seized in
[1:35:31] Joseph's time but it's consistent with
[1:35:33] the passage in numbers 33 stating the
[1:35:35] Exodus started when departing from
[1:35:37] Rameses so while the names of the places
[1:35:40] being called promises in the biblical
[1:35:42] text it first appeared to be a problem
[1:35:44] for a date of 1446 they aren't what did
[1:35:48] we read from the Proverbs it's the glory
[1:35:50] of God to conceal not to destroy
[1:35:54] to hide you gotta dig it out to conceal
[1:35:57] a thing in the honor of kings to search
[1:36:00] it out bottom line you can't use a city
[1:36:04] or a region name to establish a boundary
[1:36:07] for the time of an historic event in the
[1:36:10] Bible if it existed or not that's one
[1:36:12] thing the name of it that's something
[1:36:14] else well there's another issue related
[1:36:18] to the date of the exodus that some
[1:36:22] people really love to bring up and
[1:36:25] that's about a fellow named Akhenaten
[1:36:30] if the exodus happened under ramasees
[1:36:34] the second is many contend then it was
[1:36:36] in the mid 1250 s bc we've established
[1:36:38] when Ramses was Pharaoh
[1:36:41] well the century earlier than Rama sis
[1:36:45] was this guy named egg Naughton he's
[1:36:48] called a Heretic Pharaoh he said there
[1:36:50] was one God he abolished the
[1:36:52] polytheistic religion of Egypt and he
[1:36:54] tried to convert Egypt to a monotheistic
[1:36:57] religion worshiping only the Sun God Rob
[1:37:00] well not as reformed it and last his son
[1:37:03] Tutankhamun
[1:37:04] King Tut reestablished the old
[1:37:07] polytheistic religion now if the Exodus
[1:37:10] happened under amesys the argument goes
[1:37:13] then moses hanging around the palace
[1:37:16] heard about this heretic guy and got the
[1:37:19] idea of one guy
[1:37:20] monotheism well Abraham was a
[1:37:22] monotheistic guy but but Abraham didn't
[1:37:24] establish a religion he beside a
[1:37:26] circumcision but he didn't establish a
[1:37:28] religion he didn't establish Judaism but
[1:37:30] but Moses did a religion with prayers
[1:37:34] and worship and altars and preachers and
[1:37:36] methods of sacrifice and dietary
[1:37:38] restrictions and dress codes in central
[1:37:39] Texan and Tabernacles with very precise
[1:37:42] dimensions as we heard this morning
[1:37:45] Moses did that but if the exodus is at
[1:37:49] 14:46 BC that turns the tables now Moses
[1:37:53] did this a hundred years before
[1:37:55] ignorin and Nick not maybe heard the
[1:37:58] rumor in the in the
[1:38:00] palace of a suppressed story about how a
[1:38:03] pharaoh was defeated by this eighty year
[1:38:05] old guy with a stick under one God so he
[1:38:09] thought that's pretty powerful
[1:38:11] maybe I'll go ahead and make a religion
[1:38:13] about that it it blows out the argument
[1:38:16] that Moses got this from McNaughton well
[1:38:19] there's another problem the New Kingdom
[1:38:23] Pharaoh
[1:38:23] 14:46 taught Moses a third as we've said
[1:38:26] now many Egyptologists place his reign
[1:38:30] of 54 years which apparently was
[1:38:33] starting at age two and they say well it
[1:38:36] started in 1479 be seen he died in the
[1:38:39] spring of 1425 BC this is based on
[1:38:42] information found in the tomb of a
[1:38:44] military commander named a Menna hat ma
[1:38:46] vu there's no test it's okay they paid
[1:38:49] his death which the inscription says was
[1:38:51] in his 54th
[1:38:53] year of reigning on the thirtieth day at
[1:38:55] the third month of the season for ret
[1:38:57] they say as 11 March 14 25 BC one of the
[1:39:00] very few pharaohs going back that you'll
[1:39:02] find where they nail a date why because
[1:39:05] it's a conflict with what the Bible says
[1:39:07] so they want to nail it down right and
[1:39:09] his accession when he came to the throne
[1:39:11] was on the first month of the season
[1:39:13] Shemin one day for which I'm sure you've
[1:39:15] all worked it out as a 24th of April 14
[1:39:18] 79 BC this is one of a very few
[1:39:22] Pharisees who's dating has known this
[1:39:25] accurate so if he didn't drown in the
[1:39:27] Red Sea in 1446
[1:39:29] he died in 1425 so the Exodus maybe it's
[1:39:33] a fairy tale but at a minimum the
[1:39:36] timeline seems to be can't trust the
[1:39:39] Bible for history well okay
[1:39:42] Egyptian chronology who is a pharaoh
[1:39:45] when how long did he rule when you try
[1:39:47] and go back 3,000 years and more things
[1:39:50] get a little bit uncertain but in the
[1:39:54] Psalms we read the heavens declare his
[1:39:58] righteousness all the people see his
[1:40:01] glory I got up at 4 o'clock this morning
[1:40:03] to see the comet I don't know if and if
[1:40:05] you did that
[1:40:05] but it was kind of cool that all the
[1:40:07] people see his glory Psalms 19 the
[1:40:11] heavens declare the glory of God the
[1:40:14] firmament showeth his handiwork day unto
[1:40:17] day uttereth speech night and tonight
[1:40:19] show with knowledge there's no speech
[1:40:21] nor language or the voice is not heard
[1:40:22] everybody can see this guy well these
[1:40:26] days these days we have tools that can
[1:40:30] help us pinpoint times and events in
[1:40:32] history if we can tie these historically
[1:40:34] attested events to certain types of
[1:40:36] astronomical events this is similar to
[1:40:38] how we tied show shank into the Bible if
[1:40:41] we got some astronomical think we can
[1:40:43] tie we can nail down the particular
[1:40:45] Pharaoh at the particular time plus or
[1:40:49] minus regarding that particular event
[1:40:51] well it turns out just coincidentally
[1:40:54] that there's a three and a half thousand
[1:40:57] year old papyrus called the eber's one
[1:40:59] we're talking about which I come out a
[1:41:01] sheet of paper that's three and a half
[1:41:04] thousand years old and this records the
[1:41:09] sighting that's why it's a rare piece of
[1:41:11] paper right it records the sighting of
[1:41:14] an astronomical event called the
[1:41:15] heliacal rising of Sirius now the
[1:41:18] heliacal rising of Sirius happens every
[1:41:20] year but it occurred according to this
[1:41:24] papyrus this particular time on the
[1:41:26] ninth day of the third summer month of
[1:41:28] the ninth year of a men attempt the
[1:41:30] first now a men attempt the first is
[1:41:32] identified for this now he's the second
[1:41:34] Pharaoh the 18th dynasty
[1:41:36] he's Tut Moses the thirds
[1:41:37] great-grandfather we're getting pretty
[1:41:40] close okay got your shovels we got to do
[1:41:46] a little spade work here we got to get
[1:41:48] this foundation laid we got to make it
[1:41:50] solid I'm gonna spend about five or ten
[1:41:52] minutes now getting some getting a
[1:41:54] little technical it'll be worth it stay
[1:41:57] with me heliacal rising of Sirius if you
[1:42:04] can't see it that red arrow there that's
[1:42:07] pointing to Sirius the Sun happens to be
[1:42:09] below the horizon there behind the
[1:42:11] pyramids a heliacal
[1:42:14] jackal rising is the first appearance of
[1:42:17] a star in the morning sky now now some
[1:42:20] stars like the Polar Star doesn't matter
[1:42:22] you can see it any time of the year it's
[1:42:24] up there right but but Sirius is the
[1:42:28] brightest star in the sky after the Sun
[1:42:31] its position when viewed from the earth
[1:42:34] is such that it disappears it's washed
[1:42:37] out by the Sun for a period of time and
[1:42:39] then it sort of comes out from behind
[1:42:41] the Sun and then you can see it just
[1:42:42] before sunrise so it's the first visible
[1:42:47] sighting of Sirius just prior to sunrise
[1:42:50] after Sirius has been blocked by the
[1:42:53] brightness of the Sun due to the Earth's
[1:42:55] orbital position now and Egypt this is a
[1:42:58] very important observation because it
[1:43:00] coincided with the flooding of the Nile
[1:43:02] River everybody need you to live along
[1:43:04] the river but when that River rose
[1:43:07] sometimes it rose as much as 46 feet so
[1:43:11] we talked about RepRap watch out for
[1:43:13] flooding here in Tucson because it
[1:43:15] rained 3/10 of an inch we're not talking
[1:43:17] about that we're talking about 46 feet
[1:43:19] ok so it's important to not get caught
[1:43:22] on that flood the Nile flooding we knew
[1:43:25] the topsoil provided an irrigation this
[1:43:28] made Egypt one of the most reliable
[1:43:29] producers of wheat and grain in the
[1:43:31] ancient Near East the Niles 4,000 miles
[1:43:33] long it gets its water from the
[1:43:35] mountains of Central Africa near the
[1:43:37] equator so we know right Pope Gregory
[1:43:42] helped us out on this that a year's
[1:43:44] about 365 and a quarter days right so we
[1:43:47] put in a leap year every four years to
[1:43:49] get things back on track the ancient
[1:43:52] Egyptian solar calendar was 365 days
[1:43:55] they didn't have a leap year the result
[1:43:58] is at an annual event like for example
[1:44:01] the heliacal rising of Sirius it slips
[1:44:04] in the calendar by a day every four
[1:44:06] years six hours a year okay that's the
[1:44:10] characteristic of the calendar it's not
[1:44:12] a problem with the earth of the orbit or
[1:44:13] the length of the orbiter
[1:44:15] so this slippage in the Egyptian
[1:44:19] calendar is known as a suffix cycle it
[1:44:22] was first realized and calculated in
[1:44:24] 1904 just a little over a hundred years
[1:44:26] ago the result is that every one
[1:44:30] thousand four hundred and sixty-one
[1:44:32] years that slippage will bring things
[1:44:34] back to the same date and time again
[1:44:37] okay this is getting Jessica Brother
[1:44:42] wild bear with me bear with me the event
[1:44:44] is it's similar for us let's bring it to
[1:44:47] ourselves the moon has an orbit of a
[1:44:50] little over twenty nine days but our
[1:44:51] calendar has months of 30 or 31 days
[1:44:54] typically so what happens in 2020 this
[1:44:57] year in March on March 24th there was a
[1:45:01] new moon at April it wasn't to 24th it
[1:45:04] was the 23rd on May it was a 22nd and so
[1:45:08] forth it slips okay in 2021 when we get
[1:45:12] back to March the new moon won't be on
[1:45:14] the 24th it'll be on the 13th oh the
[1:45:19] next time that we'll have a new moon on
[1:45:21] March 24th
[1:45:23] isn't twenty thirty nine okay you're
[1:45:27] getting glassy-eyed let's take a break
[1:45:28] let's play a game we're gonna play a
[1:45:32] game called pretend okay now that's a
[1:45:36] little too juvenile for you we're gonna
[1:45:38] do a thought experiment that's what
[1:45:39] Einstein called it it still just
[1:45:41] pretended right here's the game okay
[1:45:45] everybody with me you're a future
[1:45:47] archaeologist you find an inscription
[1:45:50] someplace it says in the fourth year of
[1:45:52] President Trump the new moon occurred on
[1:45:55] March 24th now now from from the context
[1:45:59] of this record you're able to to note
[1:46:02] that that this inscription somehow was
[1:46:04] talking about the first half of the 21st
[1:46:07] century somewhere between 2000 and 2050
[1:46:10] so you ask your Android watch hey Google
[1:46:12] give me a list of New Moon's on March
[1:46:14] 24th in the first half of the 21st
[1:46:16] century and it comes back and says 20
[1:46:20] 2014 13 9
[1:46:22] okay so you know on that that he was
[1:46:25] either elected in 2016 because that's
[1:46:27] 2020 - for because it's the fourth year
[1:46:29] right or that he was elected in 2035
[1:46:32] because that's 20 39 - 4 but if you know
[1:46:35] from another source maybe you found a
[1:46:37] copy of the Constitution or something
[1:46:38] that federal elections are only held in
[1:46:41] even years well you can rule out the
[1:46:43] 2035 date and pin his election being in
[1:46:46] 2016 so you're using that slippage of
[1:46:50] the calendar to help you nail down when
[1:46:52] some event in history occurred
[1:46:55] assembling clues so similarly this
[1:46:59] recorded observation of the heliacal
[1:47:02] rising of Sirius can be used to
[1:47:04] resynchronize the dates of Egyptian
[1:47:06] history and what we call the New Kingdom
[1:47:08] the error around the time of the Exodus
[1:47:10] with our modern calendar but to do this
[1:47:14] we have to know another piece of
[1:47:16] information we have to know where the
[1:47:18] sighting took place we have to know the
[1:47:20] latitude north or south of the Equator
[1:47:22] or the observation occurred for I'll
[1:47:26] give you another example this year 2020
[1:47:30] the heliacal rising of Sirius here in
[1:47:33] Tucson will be seen on August the 3rd
[1:47:36] that's just a couple of weeks from now
[1:47:38] brother Matt Beaufort South Carolina is
[1:47:41] the same August the 3rd but if you're in
[1:47:44] the San Francisco Bay Area Reno
[1:47:46] somewhere in that latitude
[1:47:47] it'll be August 11th 8 years 8 days
[1:47:50] later before you'll see if you live up
[1:47:52] in the Seattle area
[1:47:53] it'll be August 19th latitude matters
[1:47:57] and of course in Seattle that's only if
[1:47:59] the skies clear ok well here's a a map
[1:48:05] that's really hard to see but this is
[1:48:08] Egypt and I've got two arrows there if
[1:48:12] the sighting that's recorded in the days
[1:48:14] of tech Moses great-grandfather was in
[1:48:17] Memphis which is up near the Nile Delta
[1:48:20] then this sighting took place in 1537 BC
[1:48:26] you don't have to remember that
[1:48:28] if the observation took place in Thebes
[1:48:31] further south than it was in 1517 BC
[1:48:36] that's called below or the south
[1:48:39] chronology this is called the high or
[1:48:41] the North chronology these two locations
[1:48:44] are marked on red here
[1:48:45] now most scholars of Egyptian stuff
[1:48:48] agree that the sighting was most likely
[1:48:51] in the south and most of the references
[1:48:54] you'll find if you look things up and
[1:48:56] the New Kingdom and Egypt will use this
[1:48:58] low chronology sometimes they identify
[1:49:01] they're doing it sometimes they don't
[1:49:03] know it's probably not going to be a big
[1:49:05] surprise to those of you that are still
[1:49:07] awake but the high chronology which was
[1:49:10] accepted by only a small minority of
[1:49:13] scholars syncs up perfectly with the
[1:49:17] Bible while the low chronology far more
[1:49:22] popular doesn't is there some way that
[1:49:26] we can decide it so some way we can know
[1:49:28] which of these is correct we can't say
[1:49:30] well this one syncs up with a Bible it's
[1:49:32] got to be correct because we're talking
[1:49:33] to people that don't accept the Bible's
[1:49:36] accuracy right that's their whole
[1:49:38] argument remember we're dealing with our
[1:49:43] youth being told science in the Bible do
[1:49:45] not agree
[1:49:45] the Bible's philosophy is to religion
[1:49:48] it's not accurate for historical
[1:49:49] purposes so it's no more valid than
[1:49:51] Hinduism Buddhism Islam or atheism
[1:49:56] rampant skepticism okay this is the June
[1:50:04] 18th 2010 issue of science May 2010 10
[1:50:10] years ago information in here that was
[1:50:13] not known 11 years ago 2010 our calendar
[1:50:18] right what's what is it this issue of
[1:50:22] this magazine reported findings of an
[1:50:25] unprecedented investigation by Oxford
[1:50:28] University using something called radio
[1:50:30] carbon or carbon 14 we'll talk about
[1:50:33] that in just a moment
[1:50:34] using these dating methods on more than
[1:50:36] 200 organic plant based sample seeds and
[1:50:39] things like that that could be directly
[1:50:41] associated with various Pharaohs we
[1:50:44] found this Pharaoh and in his money we
[1:50:46] found these coriander seeds or something
[1:50:48] like that and in cooperation with a
[1:50:51] large number of museums to get all these
[1:50:53] samples because these are very rare and
[1:50:55] very valuable and working with other
[1:50:57] scientists in Europe and Israel and what
[1:51:00] did they determine I know this is really
[1:51:04] hard to see I'm going to point it out
[1:51:06] ahead of time this is a minute f1 this
[1:51:08] is the guy that we're talking about with
[1:51:10] this heliacal rising of Sirius this blue
[1:51:12] line you see here trust me it's a blue
[1:51:15] line that's the low chronology this red
[1:51:19] line that's right in the middle of this
[1:51:21] gray bump right in the middle of this
[1:51:24] little bracket down here that's the high
[1:51:26] chronology okay well the gray bump is
[1:51:30] the result of the radiocarbon dating as
[1:51:33] you get closer to the middle where it
[1:51:34] Peaks up is more and more certain more
[1:51:37] and more samples and they ran millions
[1:51:39] of tests on each of these samples what
[1:51:42] what is this showing that the high
[1:51:45] chronology the red line is the right one
[1:51:48] it aligns with the science that was done
[1:51:54] one decade ago nobody could know this
[1:51:59] they could only surmise it or my PS my
[1:52:01] pastor said or I think or I believe or
[1:52:03] it might have been it is the high
[1:52:07] chronology rigorous scientific research
[1:52:11] supported the biblical narrative of the
[1:52:14] time of the excess but not until 2010
[1:52:19] in Romans Paul tells us is written as I
[1:52:23] live saith the Lord every knee shall bow
[1:52:27] to me every tongue shall confess to God
[1:52:31] Oxford University just did that right
[1:52:36] this is well documented peer-reviewed
[1:52:39] science these researchers put this
[1:52:42] information plus other research together
[1:52:43] in this book that was published by
[1:52:45] Oxford in 2013
[1:52:47] seven years ago seven years ago
[1:52:53] 15:37 BC is just 11 years before Moses
[1:52:59] birth in 1526 if the Exodus was in 1446
[1:53:04] when he was 80 okay I don't know what
[1:53:10] this does for you but it seems that God
[1:53:13] placed a worker he placed it in the sky
[1:53:18] and a piece of paper that survived 3,500
[1:53:20] years and some guys too so that they
[1:53:25] could come together in our day and be
[1:53:32] decoded to mark the central event in
[1:53:35] time of the entire Old Testament the
[1:53:38] Exodus
[1:53:40] okay we're laying foundations this is a
[1:53:43] two minute trust me you can set your
[1:53:47] watch maybe two and a half minutes an
[1:53:49] explanation of what does carbon-14 also
[1:53:51] known as radiocarbon what it is what it
[1:53:53] means for dating these kinds of things
[1:53:55] that dr. mcfadden feel free to jump in
[1:53:59] and correct with Peter's PhD is in
[1:54:00] carbonyl carbon
[1:54:03] this element 12 carbon 12 on the
[1:54:06] periodic table of the elements you
[1:54:07] recall this when you memorized it from
[1:54:09] high school chemistry I'm sure all of
[1:54:11] you said oh yeah carbon 12 I see that
[1:54:13] our upper atmosphere is bombarded by
[1:54:17] cosmic rays this releases neutrons this
[1:54:21] results in the formation of a tiny
[1:54:23] amount of carbon-14 which is a standard
[1:54:25] plain old carbon atom with two extra
[1:54:27] neutrons that got smashed into
[1:54:29] these combined with oxygen to form
[1:54:32] carbon dioxide co2 this stuff the winds
[1:54:35] atmospheric currents bring it down to
[1:54:37] the surface of the earth and what
[1:54:39] happens plants down here bring it in
[1:54:42] through photosynthesis all that high
[1:54:44] school biology stuff that you need you
[1:54:46] to learn here it is okay so it's
[1:54:50] absorbed by these plants as long as
[1:54:51] they're living and doing photosynthesis
[1:54:53] what happens when the plant dies it's
[1:54:56] not doing photosynthesis anymore okay
[1:54:59] carbon-14 is rare but it's formed all
[1:55:04] the time this way but but for every one
[1:55:08] atom of carbon 14
[1:55:11] there is one trillion a thousand billion
[1:55:16] a million million regular plain old
[1:55:19] carbon-12 atoms so this stuff is pretty
[1:55:22] rare in fact it was only discovered in
[1:55:27] 1940 eighty years ago 1939 nobody knew
[1:55:31] it existed
[1:55:32] okay now carbon-14 is mildly radioactive
[1:55:37] so no if you've been in your garden at
[1:55:40] night you know plants don't glow in the
[1:55:41] dark so either will you if you eat your
[1:55:43] broccoli okay but but carbon-14 decays
[1:55:47] to carbon-12 over time it has a
[1:55:50] half-life which means that if you've got
[1:55:52] a pile of carbon-14 half of it will
[1:55:55] become carbon-12 and about 5730 years
[1:56:01] okay if we know what the ratio of carbon
[1:56:04] 14 to carbon-12 was when a plant was
[1:56:06] alive and then when it dies and stops
[1:56:09] absorbing that co2 we measured the ratio
[1:56:11] of a carbon 14 to carbon 12 and the
[1:56:13] remaining plant material that we have
[1:56:15] these seeds that came from the mummy or
[1:56:17] something then we can measure that ratio
[1:56:21] we get an idea when the plant died
[1:56:24] the method is statistical in age
[1:56:25] remember that great bunk wasn't just a
[1:56:27] line it was a bump because there's
[1:56:29] there's it's statistics it says well
[1:56:31] there's a 90% chance at this and a 50%
[1:56:34] chance at sis and a 10% chance it's this
[1:56:36] okay so and what do I mean by that if
[1:56:41] you go to Betsy Betsy Ross's scrapbook
[1:56:44] and take a piece of cotton from the flag
[1:56:46] or something that she made and try and
[1:56:48] carbon dated it's not going to come back
[1:56:50] and say dink dink dink dink July 4th
[1:56:52] 1776 it's not going to do that but it'll
[1:56:55] save somewhere between 1760 and 1790 or
[1:56:59] or or perhaps between 1772 1780 it'll
[1:57:03] really help narrow it down we know that
[1:57:05] it wasn't in 1600 this time goes by
[1:57:09] science gets better and better at using
[1:57:11] and understanding the limitations of
[1:57:13] carbon-14 and time to wake up we're done
[1:57:17] with carbon-14 okay now what's just any
[1:57:22] irony in this it depended on the science
[1:57:26] and the technology of our day 21st
[1:57:30] century not 20th century of our day to
[1:57:33] decode this marker this day of skeptics
[1:57:35] it took a combination of astronomy and
[1:57:38] plant biology and atmospheric physics
[1:57:41] and particle accelerators and
[1:57:42] radioactive decay and celestial
[1:57:43] mechanics and computer modeling notice
[1:57:48] if you resynchronize the löwe chronology
[1:57:51] dates by the 20 years that this implies
[1:57:54] Tut moses 1/3 will have died and 1445
[1:57:58] not 1425 Egyptian records indicate his
[1:58:03] death being in the march/april time of
[1:58:06] year same time of years the Exodus
[1:58:10] 14:45 1446 one year of potential
[1:58:16] discrepancy when you're going back three
[1:58:18] and a half thousand it's right inside
[1:58:20] our plus or minus one year window bull's
[1:58:24] eye
[1:58:26] the he boosts up cited mean to wake up
[1:58:29] the baby the Hebrew scribes who copied
[1:58:32] Moses record had no knowledge of future
[1:58:34] calendars they made up a new one Exodus
[1:58:37] 12:12 this month will be 12 - this will
[1:58:39] be the first month of the year for you
[1:58:40] your time anchor your foundation fresh
[1:58:43] start
[1:58:43] no knowledge of astronomy or or Suffolk
[1:58:46] cycles or radio isotope decays required
[1:58:49] God said you start counting now God knew
[1:58:54] what he was doing when he anchored Old
[1:58:56] Testament chronology to the Exodus and
[1:58:58] left us a marker to be decoded 3500
[1:59:02] years after the event when we most
[1:59:05] needed it when society is really getting
[1:59:08] adamant about how unreliable the Bible
[1:59:10] is couple hundred years ago people still
[1:59:12] generally accepted it now they don't and
[1:59:16] now we can use their very tools they're
[1:59:19] very methods to show that it's right
[1:59:25] god forbid paul writes let God be true
[1:59:29] and every man a liar as it is written
[1:59:32] that thou mightest be justified in thy
[1:59:35] sayings and mightest overcome when thou
[1:59:39] art judged Christianity is silly
[1:59:42] trusting in the Bible overcome when thou
[1:59:46] art judged I love this I can't prove the
[1:59:49] Exodus but I can see it almost
[1:59:51] impossibly precise correlation between
[1:59:54] the Bible's account and what science and
[1:59:57] technology and archaeology and history
[1:59:59] and ancient Egyptian records tell us it
[2:00:02] maybe it's just a coincidence it's just
[2:00:05] serendipity right
[2:00:08] now we got a look at the other kind of
[2:00:10] evidence that says maybe this isn't
[2:00:12] quite that precise right there are some
[2:00:14] lunar sightings that are recorded in
[2:00:16] Egyptian records at dealing with the
[2:00:17] absence of seeing a thin Crescent at the
[2:00:19] new moon we're told this has a 25 year
[2:00:24] cycle based on interpretations of what
[2:00:26] that means and relying on the accuracy
[2:00:29] of the observations whose techniques
[2:00:32] were not all that certain of in the
[2:00:34] reign of tech Moses the third some not
[2:00:37] all but some Egyptologists that accept
[2:00:39] the high chronology they argue that he
[2:00:42] didn't as he didn't die in 1425 but we
[2:00:45] have to use a 25 year offset not just a
[2:00:48] 20 year offset and so he died in 1450
[2:00:50] they say other Egyptologists of fit some
[2:00:54] other lunar observations especially
[2:00:56] associated with the Battle of Megiddo
[2:00:58] and suggest he died in 1447 or 1448
[2:01:04] what's going on first of all all these
[2:01:07] are a very tight cluster around 1446 and
[2:01:10] we're going back an amazing amount of
[2:01:12] time but how did they make this fit well
[2:01:15] they make it fit by adjusting the range
[2:01:17] of his father his grandfather or this
[2:01:18] guy didn't really start on this one for
[2:01:19] 13 years it was 12 okay since the
[2:01:22] knowledge of the lengths of many of
[2:01:24] these rains are not known precisely and
[2:01:26] have to be inferred from little bits of
[2:01:27] archaeological stuff historical fragment
[2:01:31] ori evidence it appears to be cheating
[2:01:34] but it's not really cheating it's part
[2:01:36] of detective work as part of trying to
[2:01:38] reconstruct what happened from the bits
[2:01:40] of evidence that you have here and there
[2:01:42] and how much do you trust this evidence
[2:01:44] versus that evidence and so forth as you
[2:01:46] get more evidence you look back you see
[2:01:49] if you made an error how does a new
[2:01:51] evidence fit evaluate to reliability the
[2:01:54] evidence this is just the so-called
[2:01:56] scientific method it's the Bible method
[2:01:59] it's what Paul told us and Thessalonians
[2:02:00] test everything evaluate reevaluate if
[2:02:05] new evidence appears it's a sort of
[2:02:08] thing that brother Branham meant I
[2:02:10] believe when he said that we should not
[2:02:12] end our list of what we believe in a
[2:02:13] period but with a comma he said this
[2:02:16] many times I'm going to give you two
[2:02:18] examples verses from 1955
[2:02:21] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[2:02:23] and forever he said now if you can
[2:02:25] believe what you believe in and your
[2:02:27] faith with a comma instead of a period
[2:02:29] saying I believe this and nothing else
[2:02:31] if you put a comma if you end it with a
[2:02:33] period I believe this plus all the rest
[2:02:36] God will show me now that's the way to
[2:02:38] do it I believe this that I have is the
[2:02:41] faith I've got this part and I'm ready
[2:02:43] to learn something else that God will
[2:02:45] tell me and teach me then you've got an
[2:02:48] open heart and the Bible said if we walk
[2:02:51] in the light as he is in the light we
[2:02:53] have fellowship one with another the
[2:02:55] blood of Jesus Christ God's Son cleanses
[2:02:57] us from all unrighteousness
[2:02:59] what a beautiful scripture skies eternal
[2:03:02] teachings walk and the light move make
[2:03:05] progress learn don't sit don't sunbathe
[2:03:10] the second example is from thy seed
[2:03:12] shall possess a gate at his enemy in
[2:03:14] 1962 he said now watch you'll never win
[2:03:17] the opinion of the organization one
[2:03:19] person no sir when they've got their
[2:03:21] rule set we believe this period if you
[2:03:23] write up your doctrine we believe this
[2:03:25] comma it would be different a period
[2:03:28] means we believe this you've got to come
[2:03:30] to this and sign this paper or that's it
[2:03:32] but if you say we believe this comma
[2:03:35] plus as much as we can learn from God
[2:03:37] we're open to the Holy Spirit things are
[2:03:41] going on brother yes it's gonna be
[2:03:43] different now remember the whole science
[2:03:47] of archaeology the study of Egyptology
[2:03:49] are only about two hundred years old
[2:03:51] they came into being at the very time
[2:03:53] the skeptic started seriously calling
[2:03:56] the Bible's historical authority into
[2:03:57] question now there's still a lot of
[2:04:00] uncertainty in dating many pharaohs the
[2:04:02] lengths of their reins in this book
[2:04:04] there's a quote on page 27 it says the
[2:04:07] Egyptian historical chronology is
[2:04:09] perhaps best summed up by professor
[2:04:11] kitchen in 1991 and his classic paper
[2:04:13] historical and archaeologist oracle and
[2:04:18] archaeological chronologies if egypt
[2:04:20] have long provided a backbone for
[2:04:23] establishing time scales in world
[2:04:24] history and archaeology however they do
[2:04:28] not provide that backbone easily or with
[2:04:30] uniform exactitude bottom line for the
[2:04:34] Exodus we appear to be at most four
[2:04:36] years off after three and a half
[2:04:38] thousand years and likely within one
[2:04:41] year now science cannot conclusively
[2:04:44] dispute this state nor can they
[2:04:45] absolutely confirm it but science tells
[2:04:48] us it's eminently plausible and our time
[2:04:52] anchor to resynchronize the calendars
[2:04:54] this rare preserved papyrus recording
[2:04:57] the annual helical rise of Sirius
[2:05:00] happened less than a century before the
[2:05:02] Exodus
[2:05:03] Justin get much better than that well
[2:05:07] brother Lyle is there any other evidence
[2:05:10] to tie the reign of Tut Moses the third
[2:05:12] to the Exodus well let me refer to that
[2:05:15] the list of six items she had there okay
[2:05:17] here's one what about evidence of
[2:05:20] brick-making by hebrew slaves
[2:05:23] I'm glad you asked it was the right
[2:05:25] question look it's just synchronized
[2:05:27] right with this one of our checklist
[2:05:29] items was Hebrew slaves making mud
[2:05:32] bricks we read the Bible verse about
[2:05:35] that earlier this is a part of the wall
[2:05:38] of a tomb of Tut Moses vizier of his
[2:05:41] number one right hand guy his
[2:05:43] construction manager these guys built a
[2:05:46] lot of magnificent structures and the
[2:05:48] construction manager is a pretty
[2:05:49] important guy Breck Mary so there's a
[2:05:53] mural of Semitic and nubian slaves
[2:05:55] making bricks the text on the wall of
[2:05:58] the tomb indicates the slaves were
[2:05:59] prisoners of war from Nubia that's to
[2:06:02] the south on Africa and Cyril Palestine
[2:06:04] that's where the Hebrew people lived
[2:06:06] right this establishes that during the
[2:06:08] reign of Teck Moses third there were in
[2:06:10] fact Hebrew slaves making bricks was
[2:06:12] strong that aligns with the Bible story
[2:06:15] yeah what's this about prisoners of war
[2:06:18] well this is before the Geneva
[2:06:21] Conventions okay Kings routinely went to
[2:06:23] war they captured people to work as
[2:06:26] slaves prisoners of war now from about
[2:06:28] 1650 to 1550 BC right this is before the
[2:06:32] Exodus Jeep Egypt was conquered and
[2:06:35] ruled by a group known as the Hyksos not
[2:06:38] a lot is known about these guys but it's
[2:06:40] in the period between Joseph and Moses
[2:06:43] when the New Kingdom began the area that
[2:06:45] includes
[2:06:46] the Exodus Egypt was once again ruled by
[2:06:48] Egyptians anything or anyone they took
[2:06:51] from the hexose including slaves was war
[2:06:54] booty so calling the Hebrew slaves
[2:06:56] prisoners of war is not inconsistent
[2:06:58] with the biblical narrative
[2:07:02] well another checklist item was at the
[2:07:04] fair word the Exodus had chariots to
[2:07:06] tuck Moses the third have chariots well
[2:07:10] there's a famous text that tells us of
[2:07:12] his first military campaign when he was
[2:07:14] about 21 years old and and this this I'm
[2:07:18] gonna read you a short little quote here
[2:07:20] it's a paraphrase from this from this
[2:07:22] ancient document along with other
[2:07:25] supporting information was published in
[2:07:27] 2016
[2:07:28] four years ago by National Geographic
[2:07:31] and a issue called the most influential
[2:07:33] figures of ancient history the Pharaoh
[2:07:35] defied his advisors and surprised his
[2:07:38] foes by surging through a treacherous
[2:07:40] mountain pass to mount a deadly direct
[2:07:42] attack on Megiddo he rode up front
[2:07:46] during that perilous advance to show
[2:07:48] that he trusted in the gods to protect
[2:07:50] him in his troops and indeed all made it
[2:07:52] through the pass unscathed then he
[2:07:54] entered the battle at Megiddo quote on a
[2:07:56] chariot of fine gold decked in his
[2:07:59] shining armor Gaza lling and
[2:08:01] intimidating his opponents okay most
[2:08:06] Pharaoh's commanded their troops but
[2:08:08] they didn't lead them in fact of the
[2:08:12] time that I spent researching us I
[2:08:14] didn't find another one that
[2:08:16] conclusively led his troops this guy
[2:08:19] rode in the front and he had a chariot
[2:08:23] well why is it important if he rode in
[2:08:26] front let's read from Exodus the
[2:08:29] children of Israel went into the midst
[2:08:30] of the sea upon dry ground the waters
[2:08:32] were a wall unto them on to the left
[2:08:34] hand and on the right the Egyptians
[2:08:37] pursued and went in after them to the
[2:08:39] midst of the sea even all Pharaoh's
[2:08:40] horses his chariots and his horsemen
[2:08:44] Moses stretched forth his hand over the
[2:08:46] sea and the sea returned to his strength
[2:08:48] when the morning appeared in the
[2:08:49] egyptians fled against it in the Lord
[2:08:51] overthrew the Egyptians in midst of the
[2:08:52] sea
[2:08:53] the waters returned covered the chariots
[2:08:55] the horsemen and all the host of Pharaoh
[2:08:57] that came in to see after them that
[2:08:59] remained not so much as one of them in
[2:09:01] other words they drowned well Moses
[2:09:04] celebrates after this he's pretty happy
[2:09:06] guy and so were all these other people
[2:09:08] that that came through the Red Sea right
[2:09:10] so what is he what does he say the Lord
[2:09:14] is a man of war the Lord is his name
[2:09:16] Pharaoh's chariots and his hosts hath he
[2:09:19] cast into the sea as chosen captains are
[2:09:21] also drowned in the Red Sea the dread
[2:09:23] depths have covered them they sank to
[2:09:25] the bottom as a stone and a few verses
[2:09:28] later for the horse of Pharaoh went in
[2:09:31] with his chariots and with his horsemen
[2:09:33] into the sea and the Lord brought again
[2:09:35] the waters of the sea upon them but the
[2:09:37] children of Israel went on dry land in
[2:09:39] the midst of the sea there's another
[2:09:41] account of this that's in the Psalms
[2:09:43] there's lots of accounts but we'll just
[2:09:45] stop with this one to him
[2:09:47] this is Psalm 136 to him which divided
[2:09:50] the Red Sea into parts for his mercy
[2:09:52] endureth forever and made Israel to pass
[2:09:55] through the midst of it for His mercy
[2:09:57] endureth forever but overthrew Pharaoh
[2:10:00] and his hosts in the Red Sea for his
[2:10:03] mercy endureth forever okay warning for
[2:10:07] little kids
[2:10:08] the next image might be a little bit
[2:10:10] disturbing because it's a picture of a
[2:10:12] mummy's head okay
[2:10:14] so just want to warn you in case you
[2:10:16] want to deal with that but this is a
[2:10:19] head shot a pet Moses the Third's
[2:10:21] mummified remains this is the man who
[2:10:24] whispered Moses and God 3,500 years ago
[2:10:28] in Egypt they say wait a minute brother
[2:10:30] a while if his army sank is a stone how
[2:10:33] could we have his money well Exodus 14
[2:10:36] thus the Lord saved Israel that day out
[2:10:39] of the hand of the Egyptians and Israel
[2:10:40] saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore
[2:10:44] bodies float you can be sure the
[2:10:47] Egyptians are going to locate and
[2:10:49] retrieve the Pharaohs body right he's
[2:10:51] considered a God by these people now
[2:10:53] close reading of the biblical text
[2:10:55] doesn't unequivocally state that Pharaoh
[2:10:58] drowned the verses we read they strongly
[2:11:01] suggest that he did if he was riding in
[2:11:03] the front of his troops he most
[2:11:05] certainly did
[2:11:08] okay well what about his firstborn that
[2:11:13] was on the list
[2:11:15] Exodus 11 Moses said thus saith the Lord
[2:11:18] about midnight will they go out into the
[2:11:20] midst of Egypt and all the firstborn of
[2:11:22] the land of Egypt shall die from the
[2:11:25] firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon
[2:11:26] his throne even did the firstborn of the
[2:11:28] maidservant behind the mill and the
[2:11:29] first one of the beasts Egyptian history
[2:11:33] records that Tut Moses thirds firstborn
[2:11:36] son and then and had the guy that was
[2:11:39] going to be the Pharaoh pre deceased him
[2:11:41] his son died might have been during the
[2:11:45] plagues we don't know the dates unknown
[2:11:47] it's suggested that it was some years
[2:11:50] before but his son his firstborn died
[2:11:55] well what about the daughter of Pharaoh
[2:11:58] that saved him as a boy who was Pharaoh
[2:12:01] then how does that tie him
[2:12:03] well here's another one of these hard to
[2:12:07] read timelines here we see a timeline of
[2:12:11] the Pharaohs from the Sirius observation
[2:12:13] I don't that's not serious like not
[2:12:16] funny but that's serious like the name
[2:12:18] of the star that's right there until the
[2:12:21] Exodus where our timeline is anchored
[2:12:23] and there's the pharaohs and then
[2:12:25] attempt the first Tut Moses the first
[2:12:27] son Moses I co-taught Moses the third
[2:12:29] the guy we're talking about and the end
[2:12:32] of Tut Moses the third okay the pharaohs
[2:12:36] listed in their dates are based on
[2:12:37] historical records and the best
[2:12:39] reconstructions that Egyptologists can
[2:12:41] do and take into account the high core
[2:12:42] knowledge II that was confirmed by the
[2:12:44] oxford university a minute tip the first
[2:12:47] rains for twenty-one years until about
[2:12:49] 15 26 now the length of his reign is
[2:12:51] known it's documented in lots of places
[2:12:54] in Egyptian history as being either 20
[2:12:56] years and seven months or twenty-one
[2:12:59] years and we know that the ninth year of
[2:13:01] his reign included the year 15:37 BC
[2:13:05] from the helical rising of Sirius so his
[2:13:09] son Tut Moses a first takes over around
[2:13:12] 15 2016 so about 15 13 the length of
[2:13:16] that rain is disputed
[2:13:18] well Tut Moses the first this guy that's
[2:13:21] raining in 1526 he had a well-known
[2:13:23] daughter from a royal wife a mozi that
[2:13:27] was the name of his wife she was a
[2:13:29] pharaonic ancestry her father was a
[2:13:31] pharaoh lot lots of Pharaohs in her in
[2:13:34] her background the daughter's name
[2:13:37] Hatshepsut now he had a few sons as well
[2:13:42] but had ship suits the only daughter
[2:13:45] that I could find listed in any of the
[2:13:48] of the places I was able to look so it's
[2:13:50] quite possible but it's not certain but
[2:13:53] it's quite possible that she was a
[2:13:55] daughter of the Pharaoh that rescued
[2:13:58] Moses as a baby now about the start of
[2:14:02] Chuck Moses ones reign we read Pharaoh
[2:14:04] that's Tut Moses the first charged all
[2:14:06] his people saying every son that is born
[2:14:08] you shall cast into the river and every
[2:14:10] daughter you shall save alive now he's
[2:14:12] only the Pharaoh in 1526 the guy with
[2:14:14] the daughter
[2:14:15] if the Exodus happened in 1446 if the
[2:14:18] high chronology was in 1537 okay well we
[2:14:23] know the story would happen from the
[2:14:24] biblical narrative Moses is born he's
[2:14:26] hidden for three months then he sent
[2:14:28] floating down the Nile in a basket and
[2:14:30] Miriam his sister's watching to see what
[2:14:32] would happen and it says the daughter of
[2:14:34] Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the
[2:14:36] river and her matey's walked along by
[2:14:37] the river side when she saw the Ark
[2:14:39] among the flags of kind of a weed that
[2:14:41] grows along the river she sent her maid
[2:14:43] to fetch it and when she opened it she
[2:14:47] saw the child to behold the babe wept
[2:14:49] and she had compassion on him she had
[2:14:54] compassion on him she knows the edict
[2:14:56] kill all the male Hebrew children she
[2:14:59] knows that you declared compassion on
[2:15:01] this guy she said this is one of the
[2:15:03] Hebrews children then said Moses sister
[2:15:07] to a Pharaoh's daughter shall I go and
[2:15:09] call to the inner city Hebrew women that
[2:15:11] she nursed a child for thee that's
[2:15:14] pretty bold but Pharaoh's daughter was
[2:15:17] was pretty young at this point but I
[2:15:18] think she's between 10 and 13 years old
[2:15:21] and she's not really shocked to see him
[2:15:23] Hebrew
[2:15:24] nearby they've got lots of slaves around
[2:15:26] here maybe just thought choose another
[2:15:28] one of the servants well we know the
[2:15:31] story the child Moses grew and she Moses
[2:15:35] birth mother and wet nurse brought Moses
[2:15:37] under Pharaoh's daughter and Moses
[2:15:38] became Pharaoh's daughter's son and
[2:15:40] Pharaoh's daughter called his name Moses
[2:15:43] she said because I drew him out of the
[2:15:45] water so here's this this young very
[2:15:49] young woman with compassion an act of
[2:15:52] kindness who was she Shep suit would
[2:15:56] have been about ten to thirteen years
[2:15:57] old at this time that's based on her age
[2:15:59] of death determined by examining her
[2:16:01] mummy and so forth
[2:16:02] it's not unusual in these days for a
[2:16:05] thirteen-year-old a woman to have a
[2:16:07] child and notice that everyone in the
[2:16:10] royal house at this time is Moses this
[2:16:12] and Moses that Tut Moses went up Moses
[2:16:14] to tuck Moses three her mother's name
[2:16:18] was I'll mosey right so she just called
[2:16:21] him Moses well how did Moses escape
[2:16:27] Egypt at age forty when Pharaoh wanted
[2:16:30] to execute him for killing an Egyptian
[2:16:32] Fissel official that's on the checklist
[2:16:34] and in fact it's the only remaining item
[2:16:40] now for something that I think will
[2:16:43] really surprise you it really surprised
[2:16:45] me when I dug into it and realized that
[2:16:47] when I was looking into these
[2:16:49] chronologies and trying to see how this
[2:16:51] stuff fit together and you can go ahead
[2:16:54] and wake up now because we're coming to
[2:16:55] the end
[2:16:56] okay so last of the evidence we'll talk
[2:16:59] about for our foundation for tonight but
[2:17:01] back to the timeline but with Moses
[2:17:03] added to it the events again on the top
[2:17:08] of the timeline are historical the
[2:17:11] events below the timeline are biblical
[2:17:13] and this is a statue of hatshepsut in
[2:17:17] her adulthood so Tut Moses the first
[2:17:21] ranged until about 1513 Tut Moses the
[2:17:23] two rains until about 1499 and then tete
[2:17:26] Moses the third rains for 54 years
[2:17:28] remember he came to the throne at age 2
[2:17:32] he's not going to be a very effective
[2:17:35] Fero at age two okay so what happens in
[2:17:42] Egypt when this kinds of things occurred
[2:17:44] they had a regent a person that acted on
[2:17:47] behalf of the Pharaoh that basically
[2:17:49] said Pharaoh says do this Pharaoh says
[2:17:53] do that maybe he said googoo gaga we
[2:17:55] don't know but we're told that Pharaoh
[2:17:57] said this or that and this regent calls
[2:18:00] the shots until the Pharaoh is old
[2:18:03] enough and powerful enough to be Pharaoh
[2:18:05] in his own right now Hatshepsut perhaps
[2:18:13] Moses adoptive mom possibly we don't
[2:18:17] know she becomes region and her stepson
[2:18:20] she had no sons she had a daughter and
[2:18:23] no more children she couldn't have
[2:18:24] children after that her stepson aunt and
[2:18:28] her nephew took Moses the Third's only
[2:18:30] two years old when his father her
[2:18:32] husband dies well 13 years later she's
[2:18:37] still calling the shots Tut Moses the
[2:18:40] third is fifteen or sixteen I'm sure he
[2:18:42] has an opinion and I'm sure that he's
[2:18:44] expressing it he's a teenager right but
[2:18:47] at this time right here Moses kills an
[2:18:54] Egyptian a minor official of some sort
[2:18:57] and he has to flee Egypt
[2:19:00] Hatshepsut is still co-regent until her
[2:19:03] death eight years later or so when she's
[2:19:06] in her mid to late 50s perhaps as old to
[2:19:08] sixty which is why I put her birth in
[2:19:10] around fifteen thirty eight making her
[2:19:12] 10 to 13 years old when Moses little
[2:19:16] Reed shake basket was floating down a
[2:19:18] river so for a large fraction of her
[2:19:21] co-regency in fact she took on the title
[2:19:24] of pharaoh well let's read Exodus 2
[2:19:29] when Pharaoh Thutmose is the third heard
[2:19:33] this thing the killing of the Egyptian /
[2:19:35] Caesar he sought to slay Moses Shep suit
[2:19:40] we got to get this guy she wants to kill
[2:19:43] him right maybe he's a threat I mean
[2:19:47] this guy's 15 or 16 he's sitting on the
[2:19:49] throne but he's only 15 or 16 but Moses
[2:19:52] fled from the face of Pharaoh perhaps
[2:19:56] he's allowed to escape by that other
[2:19:57] pharaoh Hatshepsut and dwelt in the land
[2:20:01] of Midian he sat down by well it's
[2:20:03] plausible that had ships it was a person
[2:20:06] who saved Moses life as a baby she
[2:20:08] certainly fits but it's certain that she
[2:20:13] was sitting on the throne when he was a
[2:20:16] 40 year old Hebrew accused murderer of
[2:20:19] an Egyptian official a Hebrew who was
[2:20:22] not executed for his crime Hatshepsut
[2:20:27] snuck in a countenance Moses killing an
[2:20:30] Egyptian official he is after all a
[2:20:32] Hebrew but she doesn't want to punish
[2:20:34] him as a Hebrew and kill him she'd been
[2:20:37] unique position on all of this stuff
[2:20:39] she's taken care of him for 40 years she
[2:20:42] has no natural son adoptive mother or
[2:20:44] not Moses lived in the panelists and
[2:20:47] hatshepsut doing quite well do you think
[2:20:51] that a well known around the palace guy
[2:20:54] like Moses his space is sort of
[2:20:56] everywhere could really evade pursuit by
[2:20:59] a determined Pharaoh in order to avoid
[2:21:01] being punished for this murder
[2:21:04] especially if the Pharaoh really wanted
[2:21:07] him killed so unlikely perhaps it's
[2:21:11] possible maybe it was something like
[2:21:13] you're really gonna fix Moses I'm gonna
[2:21:16] give you a three-day head start
[2:21:17] something we don't know we can only
[2:21:20] speculate but hatshepsut seems to have
[2:21:24] intervened here bandages and Moses flees
[2:21:27] not for his life but with his life she
[2:21:30] saved his life perhaps for the second
[2:21:32] time
[2:21:33] from a feral impose death test all
[2:21:38] things hold to that which is good
[2:21:41] well we've checked every item on our
[2:21:43] list we're closing now I'd like to
[2:21:47] invite our musicians to come having laid
[2:21:50] this foundation I think we've pretty
[2:21:52] well established sat 1446 is the date of
[2:21:55] the exodus we can now move to the time
[2:21:59] of Joseph we'll have many many events in
[2:22:03] his life in Egypt to examine and see if
[2:22:06] they synchronize with Egyptian history
[2:22:08] and culture speaking of time of course
[2:22:10] we've just run out so we'll do the
[2:22:12] concluding part of this next week be
[2:22:16] prepared for an amazing journey through
[2:22:18] the Scriptures in parallel history
[2:22:20] science and culture I realized tonight
[2:22:22] was laying bricks building foundations
[2:22:24] watching concrete dry ok but here are
[2:22:29] some of the questions we'll ask an
[2:22:31] answer next week can we verify the 430
[2:22:36] years before the Exodus date for Joseph
[2:22:39] that dates very important who was the
[2:22:42] Pharaoh whose dreams Joseph interpreted
[2:22:45] can we identify this guy and if we can
[2:22:48] can we understand why this Pharaoh was
[2:22:53] so agitated about those dreams was there
[2:22:58] some special connection there why did
[2:23:03] the butler remember about Joseph being
[2:23:06] able to interpret dreams all of a sudden
[2:23:08] what was the triggering event I'm sure
[2:23:10] Pharaoh had a lot of dreams at different
[2:23:12] times what was the triggering event that
[2:23:15] caused him to remember how did Joseph
[2:23:18] become a father to Pharaoh how does that
[2:23:22] work is there any evidence about seven
[2:23:26] years of plenty followed by a seven-year
[2:23:30] famine
[2:23:32] Egyptians aren't going to record the
[2:23:34] famine but is there evidence that says
[2:23:37] that's what happened why was Joseph able
[2:23:40] to bury his father Jacob in Canaan
[2:23:43] why wasn't Joseph able to be buried in
[2:23:46] Canaan himself how well do modern
[2:23:50] science Egyptian history and Egyptian
[2:23:52] culture mesh with the biblical narrative
[2:23:53] of Joseph do they actually support the
[2:23:57] Genesis account
[2:23:58] well answer these questions next week oh
[2:24:02] I gotta give you a teaser I got to get
[2:24:05] you back in here right I'm gonna close
[2:24:07] next week with a personal testimony
[2:24:09] about the Joseph of Genesis wait a
[2:24:14] minute brother while he lived almost
[2:24:16] 4000 years ago yeah you heard right a
[2:24:20] personal testimony but you have to wait
[2:24:23] a next week to hear it so as we end the
[2:24:28] season being serviced and brother Aaron
[2:24:30] comes I'd like us to sing how great is
[2:24:32] our God mm if I can I
[2:24:41] how great is our God how great is His
[2:24:49] Word
[2:24:51] he's the greatest wha
[2:24:57] that ever was
[2:25:01] he rolled back the wall
[2:25:06] of the mighty Red Sea
[2:25:11] and he said I will
[2:25:17] your trust in me can we trust him can we
[2:25:20] trust this coracle accuracy the Bible
[2:25:23] how great is our God
[2:25:29] how great is his word
[2:25:33] he's the greatest one
[2:25:38] that ever was worth he won't actors love
[2:25:50] the mighty red sea
[2:25:54] and it said
[2:26:05] as I was talking with brother while
[2:26:09] before he came out little bit I asked
[2:26:12] him a question but he didn't understand
[2:26:16] the question that I asked him so he told
[2:26:20] me what he's gonna preach what kind of
[2:26:22] went over it so I heard it twice he gave
[2:26:25] me shorter but I was asking him us what
[2:26:27] makes you look at things this way and he
[2:26:31] heard it as what are you gonna say but
[2:26:35] I'm glad there's people that will take a
[2:26:37] chance and look or or the gumption
[2:26:40] whatever you want to call it to go and
[2:26:42] say hey what makes this work what makes
[2:26:45] this happen brother Branham says this
[2:26:48] and it came to me as you think they are
[2:26:50] going to come very close to finding the
[2:26:52] secret of life so that means they're
[2:26:56] looking that means they're wanting to
[2:26:58] know now if man can find the secret of
[2:27:03] life they're gonna say I don't need God
[2:27:06] I can do it myself the BAM says but
[2:27:11] he'll put a stop to it because he's the
[2:27:14] only one that gives us life and I sure
[2:27:17] do appreciate he did say one other thing
[2:27:19] that I will have to I don't know maybe
[2:27:24] see the opposite side he said a two-year
[2:27:26] old Pharaoh really couldn't do a whole
[2:27:28] lot I know a lot of two-year-olds that
[2:27:31] can keep us going all day I happen to
[2:27:35] think of my grandson Asher about that
[2:27:38] Abel and I said boy boy they really can
[2:27:42] give us some but I praise God that he's
[2:27:46] got everything in his hand and in his
[2:27:49] control
[2:27:50] I believe God I believe God it shall be
[2:27:53] done just as he said oh I believe God
[2:27:58] [Music]
[2:28:03] even as I said
[2:28:06] [Music]
[2:28:08] look up and say
[2:28:24] leave
[2:28:28] look up
[2:28:36] they would come up in a prayer line
[2:28:39] brother Brandon would be there and you
[2:28:41] know as he's talking to the folks he
[2:28:43] says you know what I'm waiting for
[2:28:44] I'm waiting for him then he would say
[2:28:48] he's here and they would become
[2:28:50] appraised and he would look emesis now
[2:28:52] your name is and this happened in your
[2:28:56] life and what was he doing he was going
[2:28:59] back and showing him that this God knew
[2:29:01] all about it and he was giving them
[2:29:03] faith he was giving them that to be able
[2:29:06] to believe in hold when God opens the
[2:29:09] word and makes it real to you and you
[2:29:11] can show you from every angle that he's
[2:29:12] the same yesterday today and forever
[2:29:15] then you can stand it a critic and like
[2:29:17] he said you don't have to be harsh you
[2:29:19] have to be mean you can just say hey the
[2:29:23] Word of God and science of course has to
[2:29:25] back it because God laid all the laws
[2:29:28] out God knows every language he knew
[2:29:32] what writing was he knew so God has had
[2:29:34] his hand in it all and I appreciate him
[2:29:37] I did if you saw me walk out there I got
[2:29:40] in a phone call and it was an emergency
[2:29:42] brother Tony Ramirez he lives down on
[2:29:46] Mission Road to south towards Green
[2:29:48] Valley along the city at the mountains
[2:29:50] and there was a lightning strike
[2:29:52] yesterday and a fire started and they've
[2:29:55] been warned that they may have to
[2:29:56] evacuate it is headed in their direction
[2:29:58] so he called me and asked for prayer
[2:30:01] brother Tony and sister Mary are little
[2:30:04] in the elderly side and it physically is
[2:30:06] hard for them I have not heard back from
[2:30:08] him but let's keep them in prayer I know
[2:30:10] there's the Cardenas family was living
[2:30:13] right next door to them that used to
[2:30:15] attend church here I don't know if they
[2:30:16] still live but their folks out there so
[2:30:18] just trusting the Lord would keep them
[2:30:21] but
[2:30:21] you know that God is the same yesterday
[2:30:23] today and forever if he can say Levi pay
[2:30:28] tithe through his grandfather
[2:30:30] great-grandfather Abraham then he knows
[2:30:32] exactly what happens so and I appreciate
[2:30:35] let's stand amen he is Lord he is Lord
[2:30:41] every knee shall bow and every tongue
[2:30:44] shall confess I want to do it willingly
[2:30:47] today Oh

[2:32:17] ah
[2:32:20] gee
[2:32:23] surprise
[2:32:25] [Music]
[2:32:30] and I just asked this question how many
[2:32:33] have have you would it was race hand
[2:32:35] would say I've had somebody come back to
[2:32:38] me and say prove it show me in the Bible
[2:32:41] where it says that show me in history
[2:32:44] where it shows that give me a scientific
[2:32:46] proof I've had people say y'all you
[2:32:50] can't prove that you know I had a man
[2:32:52] tell me that when the Apostles died all
[2:32:55] they God did in his manifestation died
[2:32:57] with them but I have proof living proof
[2:33:01] that Jesus Christ is alive the same
[2:33:03] yesterday today and forever so let your
[2:33:07] life be a witness of a Living God not an
[2:33:10] argument of spirit not of I'm going to
[2:33:12] fight with you but look at what he's
[2:33:14] done
[2:33:15] her brother there was was baptized today
[2:33:17] made a comment about TL Osborn who had
[2:33:19] said he had gone to India for two years
[2:33:23] to try to witness to try to tell in the
[2:33:27] India about Jesus Christ and the people
[2:33:30] just saying well we have our Bible we
[2:33:32] have ours and and TL Osborn came back
[2:33:35] and said III was a failure because God
[2:33:41] did not vindicate in other words they
[2:33:43] didn't see God moving and what this man
[2:33:46] was saying but when brother Branham
[2:33:48] walks in all the different accounts and
[2:33:50] stands before all these religions and he
[2:33:52] said but I will show you if Jesus Christ
[2:33:55] is the same yesterday today forever he
[2:33:58] will back up what he says and he did it
[2:34:02] over and over and over he's Jesus Christ
[2:34:05] the same yesterday today and forever
[2:34:08] let him indicate your life as a
[2:34:11] Christian that's what I want for others
[2:34:13] they say well it must be because you're
[2:34:15] a living witness a living testimony of
[2:34:19] just Christ the same yesterday 10 let's
[2:34:21] bow our heads

[2:34:26] what man would look that they're gonna
