and my home insurance doesn't cover it the the company is charging me $116,000 and it's too expensive I applied for a program to help me I'm trusting and praying my Lord will provide in Jesus name my sister Grace [Music] I think that's that's all the prayer requests I have friends it's not just a custom that we do but I believe the Lord sees when we raise our hand so let's all bow our heads and I ask the congregation if you have something upon your heart that you ask now this is between you and the Lord and as he's looking down at you and your head is bowed in reverence to him if you would raise your hand and say Lord you know the petition that's on my heart pray that you would Grant it Heavenly Father we come before you in the name above all names the name of Jesus Christ and we ask father for these petitions that have been set before you our brother Silas sister Grace father and sister Ava that that you would meet these needs and then Lord also that there were hands that were

if you have a song to introduce our brother as I said before I've heard brother nol just speak one time and I thoroughly thoroughly enjoyed it when he spoke so I'm looking forward to tonight and hearing what the Lord has placed upon his heart to give to us Jesus Jesus Jesus there's just something about that [Music] name Master say [Music] Jesus like the fragrance After the [Music] Rain Jesus Jesus Jesus let all Heaven and Earth Proclaim Kings and kingdoms shall all pass away but there's [Music] something while you're standing if you'd open your Bibles to John chapter 1 and we'll read verses 1-5 and then we'll just drop down to verse 14 I've been studying the life of Jesus Christ because brother manam made a statement I'll get into that a little later but it caused me to look to go back and what it was Jesus Christ who was he what was he like what was he like as an individual and then how does that relate to me so John it said in John one it says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him without anything and without him was not anything made that was made it goes in him was a life and the life was the light of men and the light shined in the darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not and then in verse 14 it says and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father for the grace full of grace and truth and let's pray heavenly father it's an awesome responsibility to stand before the purchase of your blood We Stand Lord not as ministers with our own thoughts but Lord we try to become the channel through which you can flow because Lord if you will flow through me and your words will be that which is spoken then lord it's no longer my words but Lord it'll be yours not that I'm thus saying the Lord or anything like that but Lord you chose ministers that through ministers you could Minister unto your under the congregation you can Minister unto the Saints and so Lord I'm asking you this evening Lord just through me Minister unto your bride for I ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated I was going through brother brandom was I I read I read and listen to the messages quite often and brother Bram in God's power to transform he makes a statement he said Jesus Christ was God himself manifested because he W Jesus Christ was Jesus Christ was God himself manifested because he was a son because he was begotten but it was just a tabernacle for him to dwell in no man has seen God at any time but the only begotten of the father has declared him and God built him a house a body to live in and come down so we could touch him and I began to think about that I began to pray about that where does God dwell today I'm looking at him you literally are the body of God you are the body of Jesus Christ so you have now you are now the house that God himself lives in and that has certain implications because the way that God lived and manifest ested and expressed himself through the body we call Jesus Christ is the same way God is wanting to live and express himself now through you Jesus Christ said I don't do what I'm doing because I want to do what I'm what I want to do he says I do because this is what the father that sent me to do I'm doing only because he has directed me I'm doing it only because I have I'm under the leadership and direction of My Father which is God himself when I I was raised in a Baptist Church and so you know trinitarianism and so sometimes when I read the word well I think of that Letter's on a page and Jesus Christ was a man that lived 2,000 years ago and now he's up in heaven someplace and now this thing called the Holy Ghost is something that dwells in us and tries to correct us and lead us and guide us but when you begin to realize they're all the same it say in the beginning was the word this word when you translate it it's the logos and so when you if I if if you don't mind me using it it's the logos that now dwells in you it was the logos that came and dwelt in their body we call Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit is the logos now dwelling in you and to me this takes on a different perspective because it makees it takes care of all the trinitarian stuff I've been programmed too from time I was a child and it makes me realize that there Eternal all sufficient all Supreme Being that is what dwells in me that is what dwells in you and as us and and what God does not want you to live a Christian life because you can't what he's wanting is for you to die out to yourself so he can live his life through you because his life is the only one that he will accept as a Christian we go and we try to live this we know that we know there are certain principles we're supposed to live by we're supposed to live a certain way and act a certain way and dress a certain way and all of this if you do all of that you're a good Pharisee come on but say if it's God inside of you doing the things that he wants to do through you it's no longer a phariseeism but now you become the living manifestation of God himself and that is what's trying God is trying to accomplish in the generation in which we are now living God sent us a prophit for the one of the reasons was to take a bride and prepare that Bride for a rapture we are the time we in my opinion we're at the end time I don't see how this mess can go on much longer I'm looking for the changing of my my body this one's getting kind of old and I'm getting tired of it so I'm looking for the new one okay but I I also understand that there is something that the bride itself has to manifest before God takes her out of here we are to become the final let's see revelations 10:7 in the be let's see yeah come on in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished we we don't realize it maybe but we are to be that manifestation we are to be the revelation of God in this generation and say how can that possibly happen it's because God wants to so live inside of you until it's no longer you living but it's himself living himself through you and and this is anyway this became this became the thought that I began to work on in John 1:18 it says no man has seen God at any time but the only begotten of the son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him he ha made him known through G the life of Jesus Christ we can look at that we can read in the scriptures and we can say oh yeah this is how God look we understand what God is like because we see them we see them in Jesus Christ but God in my opinion God updated him in this generation he sent me a prophet I see Jesus Christ in that man he wasn't Jesus Christ he wasn't deity he was a man he was a sinner saved by grace he's no better no worse than I am or any of the rest of us here but yet he was able to so yield himself to the god that dwelt in him until he actually be able to manifest the attributes of God himself it goes on going back to what is Jesus Christ says in Isaiah 9:6 it says For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given the government should be upon his shoulder so who is the son who is the son that Isaiah is speaking of here and his name Shall be Called wonderful the counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace he is the summation of everything God is he was the logos and the logos is is the the logos is the full entity the full expression of what God is and so he became that full expression that's when the logos was made flesh and when that logos was made flesh then he began to declare this is the nature of what God is well if that same logos now dwells in us then we then the same attributes the same nature the same things that God expressed through that body now he's to be expressing itself through us it's not about us get yourself out of the picture as much as you possibly can it's not about us it's what we allow him to do through us I mean I I when I when I when I try and I Minister I don't want it to be about me I want to be the channel through which God can flow yeah my personality enters into it I am very much aware of that some people don't like it well I'm I'm stuck with it it's okay but we have to begin to understand our personality enters into how we act I mean it entered into brother bradam look at his life it entered in into Peter and James and John and all the rest of them their personality and Paul you look at their personality you look at the way they were like yeah their personality was there but yet God was able to take those vessels and he was so able to come and live inside of those vessels until those vessels began to declare and began to express the very nature of God himself and this is where we have to come now brother Braman possessing the enemy Gates he says now remember he was now remember he was the son of God when he was born he was God's virgin born son but when he become the Messiah that's when the Holy Spirit Come on him because the Messiah means the anointed one so he didn't become the Messiah until the River Jordan from what I understand in the River Jordan was when all of a sudden God in his fullness came and dwelt within that Tabernacle and I personally believe that I was a part of God from the beginning I believe that I was in his thoughts in the process of times I came into manifestation but because I was a part of God from the beginning God was looking for himself God was looking for that which was a part of him from the beginning well if I was a part of him from the beginning I had to come along I had to accept Jesus Christ as my savior I had I had to repent of my sins I had to go through all of that I had to go through water baptism but then God in his Mercy he filled me with the Holy Spirit he filled me with his spirit that logos began to live in sight of me for the expressed purpose of taking me and changing me into his image brother brandham had to go through the same I mean there was a time he kept running from God and running from God and finally he was on his deathbed and all of a sudden God says when he was dying he God kind of spoke to him I don't remember the exact things but God would say I've been trying to get in touch with you I've been trying to get a hold of you but obviously you don't want to serve me so okay you're on your way to hell and that's when brother bradam cried outw if you'll save me I'll serve you right then then the healing started from that point on all of a sudden God began to take that Prophet because because his calling was to be a prophet from the beginning you know God doesn't have a plan B God chose Moses to go into Egypt take the people out Moses refused he even tried to talk his way out of it God says I'm sorry there is no plan B you're it Jeremiah wanted to quit once he said you didn't tell me all the problems I was going to have and here nobody likes me everybody hates me they're trying to do away with me this that and the other and so he said I'm no longer going to even prophesy in your name I'm going to go hide out and and then he says there's something burning within my bones and I can't help to do but what I'm doing but see now it comes down to each one of us God doesn't have a plan B he chose you he chose you for a purpose he chose you so he could express himself through you and all he wants you to do is die to yourself so he can live his life through you that sounds simple but we don't die easy but if we when we begin to understand what was Jesus Christ mean as I was studying the life of Jesus Christ these are the things that came into my mind it goes on in in in uh living dying buried and Rising brother bam goes on and say he never there never was a life lived like him his because he was the god manifested in flesh when he was born he was the expression of God he was the expression of what God the father is the God the father being loved then Jesus was the full expression of love his love was from the very first time that his little baby hand strok the pretty cheeks of his mother God so Lov the world that is the unlovables that he gave his only begotten son that whoo whoever believeth in him should not perish but should have everlasting life amen when God found me I wasn't worth Saving right I was out in the world I wasn't bad I mean I was good Baptist but that doesn't count for a whole lot but I was out doing my own thing I was living my life I I mean I wasn't bad but yet when I begin to take my life and compare it to the life of Jesus Christ uh there's no comparison here Jesus Christ is vastly superior to anything that I could even hope to attain to and so sometimes I look at his life and I look at the life of brother bradam and I look at my life and I figured there's no way I could ever become what you're telling me to become and so God speaks back to me well if you'll die to yourself and let me live he says I can do it I just don't die very easy I mean I do and I go to bed you know um but I wake up in the morning it's like when one guy prayed he said Lord he says I haven't thought of bad thought thought haven't said a bad word haven't done a bad deed but I'm going to get out of bed in a minute and I'm going to need all the help I can get but see this is where we are at brother bradam struggled you can't tell me he didn't struggle when I listen to him and he talks about I'm just your unworthy servant and this that and the other be brother BR brother Bron told Brother Perry green once he says you know where where you live and where I'm living he says everything you do is sin but he said says where God is he says everything I do is sin so it's a constant struggle to become something which in one way is unattainable but yet that's why Jesus Christ died when he hung on that cross at Calvary he died he paid for all of my mistakes and so I and so I rested him and so every time I do something that I shouldn't have done or think about you know I'm always going back to the Cross because see and the cross is everything I need that's my forgiveness that's my grace that's my Mercy the stripes on his back that's my healing when I need peace I go back to him because he purchased my my peace everything I need is at the cross and so I I'm always reminding myself of why did you go there you went there for me I was I I wasn't worth anything I wasn't worth saving but because I was your child from the beginning that's why you sought me out and because you sought me out that's why you called me and when you called me that's why I responded to you and now Lord I'm trying to become what I believe you're wanting me to become but Lord there's so much of me around it's awful hard to attain to that but I know that God is still working in me Jesus Christ when he was here on Earth he made this statement he says I he said I do only what the father shows me and that it it's not I doing the works but the father that dwells in me Jesus Christ had to give up his deity and become human become Humanity in every aspect of the of in in every aspect of the word he was a human being he he was as C he was he was as human as you are with all the fra fra Frailty that goes with being a human being we'll get to that a little bit later but but well maybe that's why I'm here he said he said brother Bram says come follow me he said he was complete God and complete man in in spiritual food and de season he says he was both human and divine he was a man weeping but he had but he had to be but he had to be God to raise the dead that's right I said he was a man hungry but he was God feeding the 5,000 with a couple of biscuits and and fish five fishes that's right he was a man sleeping on the back of a boat but it was God in him that could still the waters for why he and his message were one and he said and I and my father are one he said my father dwells in me so he was the fullness of the godhead bodily we can read that in Jesus Christ we can look at the examples in Jesus Christ and like what Perry greenbait mentioned once when he was introduced to the prophet he said the prophet in his life and in his m in his ministry he said he updated the he updated the gospel to the present day because all of a sudden everything that Jesus Christ had done or was doing had done he said now I see that being done in a man and and just a sinner saved by grace I mean he he spoke the squirrels into existence he he spoke the storm out of existence he I mean he'd lay hands on the sick they would they would be they would they would recover I mean he did all these wonderful marvelous things but even when you look at listen to brother bradam talking he says I'm not doing any of this stuff he says I'm merely being obedient to the god that dwells in me he's doing these things and we say oh that's wonderful in the prophet but now it has to come down to us there's no difference here there's no difference here the same God that dwelt in that body we call Jesus Christ the same God that dwelt in the prophet we we call William bradam that same God dwells in you there's no difference it's merely a matter do you have the faith to allow the god that is in you to operate through you you know to me Faith is not believing for something faith is believing in someone and if you have faith and confidence in the one that made the promise then at that point there should be no question well God promis I mean I read the scriptures by his stripes I am healed well I believe that God why would he lie to me why would he put it in his word well if he made a promise to me okay Lord you have already healed me now I'm just waiting for its expression and I rest in that there's no longer the struggle there's no longer trying to believe and trying to believe there's no long I wonder if I should do this I wonder if I should do that and oh I made a mistake today I wonder if God's forsaken me no I rest in the fact I am a Son of God I know that I am warts and all but I know what I am I know what I'm called to be it's like when the brother was talking about be uh being redeemed redeem means to restore back to the original owner what's it doing it's taking us back from the Sinners saved by grace that we are it's taking us back to what we were in God before before there was the fall that's what redeem means it's bringing us back to a full relationship with God so we can take and we can rest in the fact I am his son or I you know the other I am his daughter whatever but we have to come to the place where we rest in this I mean I I did a study on habac that study in habac changed my changed my life God it's it's only four chapters or they were just before the destruction of Jerusalem and God had shown habac all the sins and all the problems going on and habac got righteous indignation God why don't you do something why don't you bring judgment on these people God say yeah it's a good I'm paraphrasing yeah it's a good idea I think I will I think I'll send the Chaldeans in they should do a good job and all of a sudden habac no no no no it has to be a different way they're not nice people they kill because they like to kill and that's when when you read in in the scriptures where Paul quotes he says the just shall live by faith he's referring back to habac but the faith that it's talking about there is not trying I got to believe I got to believe I got to believe no it's a Rel talking about a relationship where there is a full absolute trust in the god that has called you and once you reach the place where you actually fully trust him the struggle's over do I get sick sure I do so God says go to bed for a couple three days sleep it off bring plenty of fluids you know you get get a cold they say how with medication the cold will last five days without medication it'll last for five days just drink plenty of fluids get some rest okay but but but here again that there's no longer the struggle because God promised and I trust him what else am I going to trust in and so this is anyway this is where I where I've come in in in my life but but anyway it's the father that dwells in Jesus Christ he says that's the one doing the work brother Brown says it's the God that was dwelling in me he's doing all these works well now it's the god that dwells in you but do you have the faith now brother bradam just didn't go out and start speaking this and speaking that no God instructed I mean otherwise I want a nice red Ferrari park right out there would he do it I seriously doubt it but what would what would you do with the spoken word anyway we'll get to something else Philip said unto him show this was at the Last Supper Philip said unto him Lord show us the father that'll that'll suffice us that'll satisfy us the response from Jesus Christ is Jesus saided him have I've been so long time with you that you yet you don't know who I am who you don't know me yet Phillip you've seen me you've seen the father now how sayth show us the father believeth not that I am in the Father the father is in me the believe uh the words that I speak are you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he does the works believe me that I am in the Father the father in me or else believe me for the very Works sake it goes on in Colossians 2 he says beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy your vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ for it says in him dwelleth the fullness of the godhead bodily Hebrews 1 and3 God who had soned right times in diverse manner spake in times past and spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he appointed air of All Things by whom he also made the world who being the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person and behold All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down at the right hand of the go of of of the father this was the logos now dwelling in that body and it was that logos that was doing the things which that logos was called in that body was called to perform and to take care of he came to be the sacrifice for my sins he came to declare unto the people around him this is God this is what God is like and he began to to try and tell them but because of their because of their theology because of what they had been taught in the law they could never accept Jesus Christ because he was so different than what they imagined God to be I mean there one time in the law this one guy he was out there picking up sticks on the Sabbath day he wern't hurting anybody but he violated the law so they took him to word and they they asked Moses what do what does God say we have to do to this guy take him out and now the congregation Stone him to death because he violated the the Sabbath he wasn't hurting anybody but he violated one of God's Commandments how often do we violate God's Commandments but then when we come back and we look at Jesus Christ um like the woman taken in adultery everybody's going to Stone her that's what the law said so Jesus sat down and began to ride in the sand and they kept yelling at or yelling at Jesus Christ what do we do to this woman what do we do the law says we have to Stone her to death we have to kill her you know it's interesting it says if she was killed in the very Act of adultery the man should have also come right okay they should have grabed him that was probably one of the priests so they wouldn't okay but Jesus he wrote In The Sand and one by one they began to stop the stones until everybody had left in the mouth of two or three Witnesses nobody was going to stand and condemn her so Jesus didn't have to he just just go don't sin anymore that's God's mercy wow and God's Mercy is extended to us every moment of every day I think one place it says his Mercy is given to us every morning fresh every morning or something like that in John in 10 it says my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I gave and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my Father which gave them me is greater than I is greater than all and no man can pluck them out of my hand and it goes on to say I and my father were one but you know Jesus Christ or brother bam was saying we have to come to the place where we Unite oursel with the spirit of God that is in US until we can make the same declaration that takes commitment we're we're not talking about living a law we we are not talking about attending church we're talking about establishing a relationship between you and God Amen where you interact with him every moment of every day you're sensitive to his leading you're sensitive to his calling I mean brother Bram had to live this way all of a sudden he'd be doing something and God says I need you and he would take brother Bram here and send him there and say oh that's great for the prophet but it has to come to us God did not die in brother brandom now God through that prophet he left us a message to tell us this is how you should live this is how you should act but in order for you to do that you have to have a relationship with me you have to come to the place you love me so much you'll do whatever I'm asking you to do and once you come to the place where you love Jesus what's it what um somebody asked Jesus Christ what's the greatest of all the Commandments that's easy he says the greatest of all the Commandment love God with all your heart soul mind and spirit and the second's like in love your neighbor the same way you love yourself and this in these two Commandments is contained all of the law and all the prophets W okay so love God with everything you are it's not about you it's about him it's not about you doing it's you allowing him to do through you it goes on in in in John one we we read this in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shined in the darkness but the darkness could comprehended it not the darkness could not accept the light it goes in in in John 3:16 through 19 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his once for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed on in the name of the only begotten Son of God and this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and Men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil that hasn't changed that hasn't changed you you I mean we talk to different people in in different stages of life and they say well I like living like I'm living I like doing my drugs I like doing my drinking I like living carousing I like living in adultery I like living this why would I want to be a Christian well okay end of argument if you're not interested why should I force it on you but see now wherever we go I I live in a bubble I created my own little bubble okay in my bubble there's love joy peace longsuffering gentleness meekness patience kindness and so whenever we're interacting with somebody I mean you go to the grocery store and they always say well how are you doing is we scanning your stuff so we said well how are you doing oh um yeah okay yeah good I I you know and then we get into a conversation we'll take it as far as the Lord opens the door I'm inviting him into my bubble I'm inviting him into a relationship with Jesus Christ because I don't want to live in her bubble where it's anger and Malice and hatred and strife and all the other types of no I I like living in my bubble I I will admit to that I mean I keep up rest on the news just so I don't want to be ignorant but yet I have learned not to become emotionally involved in all this garbage okay but at but when when I talk to other people you begin to talk to some brother Bram in one place says of that guy's a good Fisher and talk to him about fishing and see if God will take the conversation and turn it toward God you guy's a good mechanic we'll start talking about mechanics I know how to put gas in yeah I still know how to do that I know how to open okay but so you talk to them about mechanics and go see if God will turn the conversation if he turns it you have an open door and I will carry it as far as God will allow it to carry I mean this is how I witness okay I I don't not I don't know how other people do it but but this is this is anyway this this is the way I do it but I'm we we are the light to the world it says in him was life and the life was the light to the world what was that life it was the life of God the life of God was to shine out unto other people and those that and those that are have any interest in in in God any interest in in Jesus Christ when the light brother BR says when the light strikes the seed the seed begins to sprout and then you can draw them in and so you have but you have to shine your light if we can't tell you from the rest of the world there ain't much light showing okay um we'll leave the rest of that alone but but you have to come down to the place where you have to let the light shine it has to be in your language it has to be in your dress it has to be where you go it has to be how you interact act it if you're businessman it has to be how you conduct your business every aspect of your life it's the life of God that is in you is wanting to express itself and that is the light that has to shine unto others and unless you let the light shine they're walk they're walking in darkness and you're not giving them much hope it goes and God came in in Jesus Christ to save the world he has he was the perfect sacrifice that would pay for the debts of the men for debt for all men but for you but for that debt for you to be paid you have to accept the payment if you owe something you know you you $1,000 dollar and I go and I'll write a check and I give it to him there you take care of it nah I don't want your check tears it up and throws it away fine enjoy your debt but see that's what you're doing if all of a sudden you know you have something in your life and God's trying to help you and God is trying and all of it was paid for at the cross I I don't hear very many people talking about the cross but the cross is the center of my life the cross is the center of every all of my hopes rest in that in that one act in the in the in in the in Calvary because there he paid for everything for me and so I keep going back because that's my hope am well if you're not offering anybody else the cross if you're not offering anybody else salvation if you're not telling them about Jesus Christ if if you're not telling them about salvation was purchased for you at at at the cross of of of Calvary and you're not in introducing that to them what are you telling them brother brand in one place says I fear too much we're getting people to church we're getting them to a Doctrine we're getting them to the message but we're not getting him to Christ but see once they accept Jesus Christ from that point everything else changes they they could believe God sent a prophet that's great Satan Satan knows that he believes that but that doesn't save Satan and nor will it save anybody else but if you bring them to the Cross if you get them to have an inner if you get them to Salvation if you get them where God himself now begins to dwell inside of them then God within them begins to mold and to change their very character until they come into the very image of Jesus Christ so sometimes we put the cart before the horse there's there's something else that I I I found interesting Jesus Christ was the second Adam okay when God created Adam Adam only had one one father if you will that that was God so the nature that Adam had my opinion would have been the same nature that Jesus Christ had okay he would have to have the genetics of of God Adam was doing great in theophany form but then God put him in a temple of clay he put him in a temple of Flesh and then he took him made him help me he took out of Eve something he created another body Eve dwelt in that body but see here again you're dealing with human nature God gave man free moral agency all of us have free moral agency brother bam says in one place you have to will to do the will of God you have to make the choice to do the will of God so Satan empty he says hey this looks interesting that brought about the fall so Adam fell the whole creation fell with him but now we look at Jesus Christ when he was in was when he was the logos okay fine when he was put and all of a sudden that logos now dwelt in human flesh would that logos and human flesh succeed where Adam failed you say was that a possibility scriptures would tend to indicate it such in uh Hebrews 4 and5 for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like we are yet without sin 1 Corinthians 10:13 there is no temptation you but such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above what you're able but will with the Temptation also make a way of Escape that you may be able to Bear it okay and then in James it said let no man say when he is tempted I'm tempted of God for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away with his own lust and enticed then when that lust hath conceived it bringeth forth Sin Sin when it is finished it bringeth forth death for him to be tempted in every way that we are brother bam says he was all man and all God that Temple that God was dwelling in we called Jesus Christ that was in every bit that was human so he so from what I read from this he had to be tempted the same way that we are otherwise how when you pray he say well Lord I have this problem how could he relate to the problem if he had never been tempted with that problem okay after Jesus was baptized in Matthew it says when Jesus was led up out of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward hungered when the tempter came to him he if you're the Son of God command these stones to be bread prove that you're the Son of God use the power that you have take the bread take the stone turn them to bread you're hungry that that why not in Jesus Christ he says man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God says then the devil taketh them up into the holy CI sit on the P Pinnacle of the temple and sayth if you're the Son of God cast yourself down for it's written he shall save his a he shall give his angels charge over thee and in their hands th shall bear thee up list at any time you dash your foot against the stone he's saying glorify yourself you say you're the Son of God jump off watch the Angels come if all these people around watch them all of these angels descend and bear you down make the Declaration glorify yourself in the eyes of people Jesus saith unto him it's written thou shallal not tempt the Lord your God then the devil taketh up into exceeding high mountain and showeth him all the kingdom of the world and the glory thereof and he say all these things will I give you if you'll fall down and just worship me and Jesus saith un them get thee hence Satan for it's written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only will you serve he's telling bypass the cross because Satan knew that there had to be a payment for sin and if Jesus Christ happened to be the Lamb of God if he happened to be the one that the the the one that of the woman's seed he was going to have to come and he was going to have to die in order to pay the price for our for our for our sins for our salvation he's saying bypass the cross I'll give you the kingdoms of the world you just be under my control Jesus said I'm going to inherit it anyway why should I do that identified mystery of Christ he said put on the whole armor of God don't stand back like some little idea of some creat or something that you're standing by put on the whole armor of God when you go to fight against the enemy like our Lord did he showed that how the weakest of Christians can defeat Satan just with the word he had powers he could have smoked Satan anyway he wanted to but he didn't use it he just took the word and defeated him saying it's written it's written it's written so what what did he do he showed us how we can defeat Satan it's written by your his stripes you're sick by his stripes I'm heal healed but you don't feel any better that don't make no difference by his stripes I am healed God told me I'm Healed but you're still don't feel good what does that have to do with it I'm Healed now I'm just waiting for the manifestation okay we go on and what you know what is the nature of God here again we're look we're looking at him in Philippians 2:4 it says look look not every every man on his own things but every man also in the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought that robbery to be equal with God but he made himself of no reputation basically he emptied himself out and he took upon him the form of his servant who was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross who being in the form of God who being the express image for being the exact duplication if you will who every in every aspect Jesus Christ was God he was the son of God he was born the Son of God does this have privilege who being the form of God he thought not robbery to be equal with God equal with God he says he said God God likeness does God likeness mean having your own way getting what you want but Jesus was God likeness essentially was giving and spending oneself precisely because he was in the form of God he reckoned equality with God not to be a matter of getting but of giving for God so loved the world he gave and that's what he keeps doing you need healing he gives you healing do you earn it ain't no way you need salvation he gives you salvation you need a job he gives you a job you need a house he gives you a house God gives do you earn it I haven't found a way to earn anything yet I mean I look at myself and there's nothing in me worth standing before God and the only hope I have is Calvary Bey outside of Calvary I have nothing but he invites me to come Jesus Christ when after he died he he what he he went and he entered into the holiest of holies and he says now that's where I want you to follow me what is the holiest of holies it's living in the presence of God himself it's living in the presence of that shakina Glory where you are so surrounded by the shakina glory until Satan can't even get to you but we don't want to go there because we have to die we have to forsake our will to take on his will when you go through what baptism you're making a declaration you've accepted Christ as your savior you make that declaration they take you up in the Baptist R they put you in a tank of water and when they baptize you they're taking you and and they're they're typing you with dying when you go under the water that's a type of you of your death then they raise you out of the water you are to rise to a new life fully dedicated and fully surrendered to God and God alone and we forget this it says he emptied himself he laid aside the form of God he laid aside his deity he took upon him the form the the he took upon the complete character istics of a slave a person without any advantage with no rights or privileges he did not expect to be treated any different than anybody else he didn't expect to be treated like anybody other than just a servant in in in in anybody's house he didn't expect any favoritism he didn't expect to be treated better he went about serving others he goes on in Luke 416 he says and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there were delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written he says the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the sent me to heal the brok brokenhearted preach Deliverance to the captives recovering of sight to the blind to set a liberty limb that are bruised and to preach the acceptable year of the Lord that's why one of the reasons he came that was his ministry John the Baptist was offended by this well look we want the king he say I'll come as a king but not not at this time that's later but see that's now ours the same anointing that was on him is now on us as God operated this through him now that God's wanting to operate that through us we are to carry on the ministry of Jesus Christ it's not about us it's about him it's not what I do for him it's what I allow him to do through me I am just I'm just a human being I'm just a vessel that I'm hoping God has find some use for anyway and that Dan Calvary brother Brown makes a statement he says he was just one man the perfect man he gave his life and he made an example for you now what must we do now the first thing I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't eternal life eternal life is living for others it proved it when he come come in the Lamb of when when it come in the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others someone said I how can you stand and let somebody uh call you such bad names you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man you become sons and the trouble of it is the church has forgot their sons you are Sons you're taking Christ's place you are Sons so don't live for yourself you live for others well brother vom I can live for this brother he's such a nice man he said that's not it live for the man who hates you live for that person who'd kill you if they could that's what they done to him they killed him and he died and and and and that he might save them that's eternal life when you get that in your your bism then you're facing heaven then brother branner makes a statement God wanted to accomplish three things one of them was to gain total preeminence in a man he did that in Jesus Christ now he wants the same preeminence in his body we call the bride and if we claim to be the bride he's trying to get total preeminence in us he's trying to get total control he got that in my opinion he got that in the Prophet The Prophet no longer tried to do his own thing he was always sensitive to the spirit of God he was always wanting to know well God what do you want me to do yeah he went hunting why did he go hunting because he was out in the wilderness and hopefully he can rest and relax and you know and and calm down and before he had to go back into the thick of things you know it it's interesting God came to dwell in man and he could have been born in a palace with all the Privileges that come with wealth could have enjoyed the few Pleasures that we have but instead God elected in Jesus Christ to be born to peasants in a cave with sheep and goats okay he elected he chose to come in the most humble form and expect nothing he was even willing to sacrifice his life for the Salvation and Redemption of his children this is the nature of God this is the life that that was that was in Jesus Christ that was manifested Jesus Christ tried to kind of instruct his disciples in Mark 9ine he says and they came they and they came to capernium and being in the house he asked them what is it you disputed amongst Yourself by the way way oh but they held their peace for by the way they would had dispute among themselves who should be the greatest he sat down and called the twel and said unto them if any man desires to be first the same shall be last and the servant of all you want to be great in the eyes of God become the servant to every man Mark 10 and when the 10 heard it they because James and John wanted I want to be on the right hand the left hand you know when the tenant heard they began to be much displeased with James and John but Jesus called to them and said unto them you know that that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles they exercise lordship over them and their great ones exercise Authority upon them it shall not be so among you whosoever will be great among you shall be your minister whosoever you would be the chiefest shall be the servant of all for a the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to Minister and to give his life a ransom for many Peter writing he says the Elder which Elders which are among you I exhort to him also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and also I partake of the glory that shall be revealed feed the flock of God which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not for filthy lucer but of a ready mind neither being as Lords over God's Heritage but being an example to the flock live Christ before them so they can see Christ in you it's not a matter of dictating dictating that that doesn't that doesn't solve anything make good Pharisees no but if we live the life of Jesus Christ before the people and they say you know that's the way I should live and that's what I saw in in brother brandham I mean he he was a man here was a sinner he had a temporary said You' fight a buds saw buds saw here was a man I mean somebody killed his dog and he was going to he was going to go shoot the guy that killed his dog some kids beat him up he went and got his rifle and he he was a dead shot he was going to kill every one of them kids he popped his head up and says you're all dead and he pulled the G bang click click click click click click click and they all ran then he picked up the same bullet stuck them in there everyone shot that was brother bam he was a price fighter you don't get in the in the ring and say now hit me softly I'm real I bruise easy don't now be gentle because you know I I'm I'm not used to this oh no he laid it on him he was a champ but that's not what God called him to be and the seed is not air in the shook brother vam he says and then and then that logos was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and now we're in St John 1 in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and now he gave and and now as as he gave his life for us then his Spirit comes back upon us and Jesus says at that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father's in me I in you and you in me and brother man other places that's in that day he says that's this day he says and we today are one the the church itself an attribute of God's thinking before the foundation of the world you you have you have a church so those which are in Christ was in Christ at the beginning and was his thoughts and his thoughts was his attributes John 14 I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while the world seeth me no more but you shall see me and because I live you shall live also because at that day you'll know that I am in the Father the father's in me I am in you and you and me the disciples he began to tell them he say he says now right now I'm the light to the world but when I go away you're going to be the light and you don't take light and shove it under a bushel and hide it no you walk around you're not to be a Hermit you interact with people but how do you interact with people are you manifesting the nature of God are you're manifesting the life of God are you trying are you by the life that you live are you expressing the very nature of of God himself because that's what God's trying to do through us Jesus Christ came to manifest God he came to he came to let the world know this is what God is and now that's come to us now the only way they're going to know what God is is they have to look at you and John 1 and5 he says and this then is the message which we have heard from him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness and if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and we do not the two but if we walk in the light as he is in the light then we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sins if the musicians would like to come it was after the disciples received the Holy Spirit at the logos that's when God's life came and dwelt in them and if you look at what they were before before Pentecost and then you look at what they were after Pentecost there's a huge difference it wasn't about them trying to gain popularity it wasn't about them trying to amass wealth it wasn't about them doing something for themselves everything they did was for somebody else they walked miles what to take the gospel they were beaten they were stoned they were crucified you think oh Christian life's going to be just a just a cakewalk just a piece of cake I haven't found it that way soon as I became a Christian said and says oh now you're my enemy now we're really going to work on you right okay but I have something inside of me now I have something inside of me that is stronger than than anything else in the universe because that which dwells in me is the logos of God the very attribute of everything God is dwells in me but I have to release him I talk to the ones in India where do you SC oh I have him hidden in my heart well I says why don't you let him out once in a while they have to see him because that's why why Christ came one last quote restoration the bride he otherwise you're going to form what's known to me as a bride see all right I'll go with you you will be a part of me you'll be my bride my life will be in your body just like a husband and wife is one you and I are going to be one at that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father's in me I am in you and you in me oh I love that and Satan gets so angry at that see the Oneness of God see the Oneness of God how can you be Oneness with God you allow the god that is in you to have the preeminence then it's no longer you living but now it's the god in you living and that's where the change comes all that God was he put into Christ all that Christ was he put into the church there you are it makes them all one I'm going to try to Majesty okay if you want to stand mesty worship His mesty unto Jesus be all glory honor and praise mesty Kingdom of for flows from his Sor onto his own his anthem's rain so exalt lift up on high the name of Jes Jesus magnify come glorify Christ Jesus the [Music] [Applause] king

don't know you can't say Time and Eternity in the same sentence because they don't exact exactly work together but there's not enough time in eternity to sing the Praises and talk about our Lord Jesus Christ there's just not the time there's we can't say enough about him how great he was and and looking at the life that our brother brought out that Jesus lived it it was a life of sacrifice it was a life of pure unadulterated obedience to the father he mentioned that brother brandom was a good example to us in this age of how someone can get themselves out of the way and let Jesus Christ come forth from that person I've given this testimony before here but I believe it's really the most important testimony that I could give from my family being so close to this man named William brandom my dad my grandfather on the Evans side if you listen to tapes you've heard brother Brandon mentioned the Evans Family many times and then my other grandfather on the on the wheeler side he was a deacon in the brandham Tabernacle for brother brandham I so I grew up hearing all of these stories all the time about this man this Prophet named William brandham and I'll tell you the stories were not about the Miracles they saw many miracles over and over again they saw Miracles my grandpa Evans my dad follow followed him around the country everywhere he went they followed him they they saw hundreds and hundreds of Miracles it wasn't about the Miracles my grandpa wheeler he was a deacon every service at the brandom Tabernacle and he saw the prayer lines he saw these things happen yet the stories that I heard from Grandpa Grandma were not about the Miracles they weren't as important as the man it wasn't about even all the doctrines that he preached and all the the Mysteries that he made known it wasn't about that I didn't hear those stories growing up those stories were there and they would come out every once in a while with the Miracles and different things but it was always about the spirit that came out of that man that is what made William brandom so special it wasn't because of the man William brandham but he was able as he said brother brandham said this a perfect quote he said if William brandham has if I have a gift in my life and we know he had many of them he said if I have a gift in my life it's being being able to get William brandom out of the way and he really did that they saw how love Came From This Man servitude sacrifice obedience to God and that is what impressed them it's exactly what our brother here was talking about that is what should come forth from a real Christian and he gave us a great example so that's what Christianity that's what the whole book is about is about letting God take control of us and letting that Spirit come out of us as our brother said I say it so often and even our brother said it I want to get a sign that says it's not about you on the front of the pulpit thank you brother I say it all the time and it's nice when somebody else says it for once God bless you brother John thoron would you come and en close in prayer my brother brother Aaron one more song if you would please you know brother null was talking
