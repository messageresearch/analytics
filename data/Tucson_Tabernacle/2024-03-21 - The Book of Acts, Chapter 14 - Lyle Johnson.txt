requests are read before the people and I know because they they really have confidence in the prayers of the Saints so make sure when there's a prayer request read from the pulpit or you see it come out on the WhatsApp or you you um I say it on on my WhatsApp broadcast make sure that you take some time to bring those requests before the Lord because the person who gave those requests has a lot of faith and a lot of confidence in our prayers so make sure that we're doing that my friend Heath Rickard he's had some health problems he's some of them are pretty serious please keep him in prayer he's in a lot of pain and he just he really he needs a touch he desperately needs a touch from the Lord Sister Green is Karen says she's getting pretty low and it could be any time that she goes to be with the Lord it'll be a glorious time for her and it'll be a glorious time in heaven when our dear sister goes across across that Veil comes into the presence of the Lord where all the other Saints

pivotal time and in the history of the Tucson Tabernacle makes sure that each one of us are doing our part bringing these decisions that we have to make before the Lord Jesus in prayer none of us want to make the wrong decision so please pray for the church pray that we're in the Lord's will that he would make his will known to us and that our hearts would be open enough to to um pray for the right thing it's about our heads [Music] as our heads are bowed take a moment think about your friends think about your family [Music] think about those that might have a need [Music] think about yourself and if there is a need that that you feel that would be for someone or for yourself [Music] where the Lord might look down upon an uplifted hand and know what's underneath that hand would you raise your hand holding that request that you have in your heart and knowing that the great heavenly father is looking over the banister of heaven and he's looking at these hands [Music] good Lord I raise

evening it's June 14th what better time to study Acts 14. tomorrow June 15th will be halfway through the month and at the conclusion of Acts 14 we'll be halfway through the book of Acts which has 28 chapters I hope you've been learning and enjoying this series as much as I have amen acts has come alive to me I'm learning a lot thank you brother Daniel for the inspiration to go through this book chapter by chapter together is a Congregation of Bible study before we open our Bibles let's approach the ultimate author the one that guided Luke as he wrote these words Lord Jesus as it says in the back of the building tonight you are the same yesterday when you guided Luke to write these words these these reports that we read and you're the same today and we know you'll be the same tomorrow and forever how long time goes on you don't change help us Lord to be yielded to you this evening Lord please take my thoughts my words my whatever might be interfering with you and open up that channel of Grace Lord where a holy God can be at one end and a and a sinful but redeemed people can be at the other end and Lord you can just move in our midst you can move with your spirit you can speak to our hearts Lord you can anoint our lips and anoint our ears Lord help me to not misspeak and help no one to mishear but help us all to draw closer to you we thank you for this opportunity to be here tonight in Jesus precious name our study of Acts showed the Evangelistic efforts of the early church exploded in Acts 13. a deliberate effort was now being made to travel not to escape persecution from Jerusalem but to spread the gospel the good news of Jesus Christ far beyond the borders of Judea and Samaria it's what we call evangelism I'd like to read two brief portions of scripture before we get into Acts 14. the first if you want to turn to it in your Bibles is the concluding verses of Matthew's gospel Matthew 28 we'll begin at the 18th verse now Jesus to the angel and so forth had told his disciples to go to Galilee and he would meet them there so this is shortly after his resurrection they've gone to Galilee and Jesus now comes to the eleven surviving disciples shortly after his resurrection and he says Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power how much all all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth for what purpose how do we keep our association with this all-powerful one what are we to do go ye therefore go it's a command it's an imperative it's not a suggestion because I've been given all power here's what you must do go and teach by example as well as words all nations everyone regardless of ethnicity Heritage background circumstances social class All Nations baptizing them in the name singular the name not the titles but the name of the father of the son of the Holy Ghost which we know is Jesus he said to go teach well what are you supposed to teach them teaching them I just told you to teach them here's what you're to teach here's the lesson plan observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and I just commanded you to go and blow behold if you do this you may rest assured that I the all-powerful one m not will be not was I am with you always even to the end of the world regardless of the passage of time I transcend time get your eyes off of time amen and if we then turn to Acts chapter 1 verses six through eight now this is in Jerusalem just prior to his Ascension that what I just read was shortly after his resurrection there's been this 40-day period he's getting ready to ascend so when they the remaining 11 disciples the same ones that he has just told us in Matthew that he has been given all power were therefore come together they asked of the resurrected Jesus saying Lord will thou at this time restored again the kingdom to Israel always wanting to know or think they do know or think that they want to know the future just like us always trying to unravel the Rapture or the tribulation or the bride or the or the church when this future event will happen What form will it take too often being distracted from what we should be expending our time and energy to accomplish so Jesus admonishes them he Jesus said unto them the disciples it's not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power stop asking me I've been given all power so if the father's put it in his power I have that power so I could tell you but I won't you're completely missing the point but pay attention now here's what this is all about it's not some secret knowledge or some obscure revelation it's not about escaping from this world but ye shall shall this is a certainty you you shall receive power where is that going to come from from me all power has been given unto me so for meat for whom all power is given the only source the repository I'll share it with you in the following way after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you the channel of grace through which I send my power to you and what's the purpose of you receiving this power ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and all Judea Samaria to the uttermost part of the Earth oh you're getting our purpose as Christians is simple spread the gospel you want to see Miracles a church like the book of Acts spread the gospel you want the power of God in your life spread the gospel you want to see the Holy Spirit move in our midst spread the gospel it's not rocket science it's bread the gospel and that's exactly what the book of Acts is all about telling the story of the earliest Christians and how they expended their lives their efforts their energies for one purpose spread the gospel let's take a quick recap of Acts that we've covered so far acts 1 gave the commission wait for the Holy Spirit we just read it and then spread the gospel to the entire world Acts 2 tells us that Spirit filling the Believers in the upper room and how they immediately wasn't the next day it wasn't after they'd studied some more it wasn't a few hours later but instantly they set about spreading the gospel even speaking words they themselves did not understand Acts 3 and 4 tells of a public miracle which led to many more converts to the way and the subsequent trouble with the religious authorities in Jerusalem acts 5 was about honesty with the fellowship and with God acts six and seven tell about Stephen the first martyr what was he guilty of spreading the gospel acts 8 tells of spreading the gospel to Samara and Judea to the Ethiopian eunuch coming to Faith acts 9 introduces solid it tells of Peter miraculous healing even raising one Dorcas from the dead getting him in position so that in Acts 10 when Cornelius has a vision Peter will be in the right place at the right time to do what spread the gospel to the first Gentile Believers the household of Cornelius acts 11 is the all two predictable reaction of people who objected to Outsiders becoming believers they have to go through what we did Fair it's not right but in Acts 11 when Peter tells them what happened and they hear the truth those who objected not only relented but they embraced the change acts 12 it tells us about Peter's escape from prison the death of Herod Antipas the one who had John the Baptist killed and mocked Jesus the morning of his execution and this brings us to the last two lessons we've had on Acts 13. which is all about what spreading the gospel here's a map it may be a little hard for you to see in the back that's a hint that you should sit closer to the front this is the Journey of Solomon Barnabas and John Mark so far from Acts 13. they left here from Antioch of Syria they sailed to the East End of the island of Cyprus salamis was the name of the city they worked away just since about 90 miles to the Western end to paphos had success in spreading the gospel message to the towns along the way just before leaving Cyprus they had an encounter with a sorcerer and the way the Lord dealt with them led to the conversion of the governor of Cyprus a man named paulus and at that time in verse 9 Luke tells us that Saul that's how we say in an English in Hebrew which means prayed for became known as Paul from paulus a Latin Roman name meaning small or humble they then sailed from Cyprus to perga the southern coast of what we Now call Turkey it's not the same as pergamus which is several hundred miles away John Mark left him at this point and he sailed back here to Jerusalem it's all in Barnabas continued Inland to Antioch of basidia it's about 94 miles if you could go in a straight line but the airlines were down that day so they had to walk through the mountainous terrain it was a bit more than 94 miles for them Paul preached a sermon there which Luke excerpts and summarizes for us in Acts 13 verses 16 to 41. well an antioccupacity they expanded their reach from those that worshiped in synagogues to the general Gentile population their vision for the mission and expanded persecution then arose we read about that in Acts 13 verses 50 to 52 where the Jewish people that did not accept Paul's teaching stirred up influential people in town and they were kicked out I think the Lord sort of nudged them to keep on walking well acts 13 ended with them journeying to Iconium which is this town right here it's about 76 miles in a straight line from Antioch of the city but again they couldn't travel in a straight line they had to go through the mountains footnote you see on the map that this region that includes Antioch and Iconium as part of this uh kind of peach colored thing it's called galatia glace is a region it's it's a province so later when Paul writes his letters to the Believers in galatia that the addresses include the churches that are established in this region that we're reading about in Acts 13 and 14. Galatians isn't written to a church in a city but to multiple churches in a region and finally while we don't know the dates and only the approximate years General consensus is that from the start of Acts 13 sorry I'll get it right there we go wrong button when they sailed from here until they eventually get back at the end of Acts 14 back to Antioch covers a period of about two years so this wasn't uh you know a quick trip we'll start reading from acts 14 now the first verse it came to pass an Iconium that they saw in Barnabas went both together into the synagogue of the Jews so they started as is normal for them with the people that believed in Jehovah the the god of the Old Testament the god of Israel and so spake they were so convincing and with the power in which they presented the message of the Gospel the Risen Messiah that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks now these are Hellenistic Jews Hellenistic Jews because remember they're speaking in a synagogue so and there may have been gentile people there as well but they were people that attended the synagogue they believed in in the god of what we call the Old Testament so they believed and they accepted the gospel message but the unbelieving Jews that is those who did not accept the gospel but spurned it stood up to Gentiles they joined forces with the non-jewish elements of the local area not just the proselytes that were worshiping in this synagogue and made their minds evil affected influence they influence them they poisoned their minds they turned them strongly against the Brethren that's primarily of course Saul and Barnabas but would necessarily include those that had been persuaded but they were not intimidated rather for a long time therefore not because of the opposition but due to the acceptance of the Gospel message that's what therefore is referring to they Abode Solomon Barnabas and Iconium speaking quietly in a barely audible whisper behind closed doors says they spoke boldly in the Lord and the lord gave testimony unto the word of his grace his Divine favor and the Lord granted signs and wonders miraculous healings and so forth to be done by their hands he backed up what they said but however in spite of this the multitude the general population of the city was divided divided in their opinion about what was being taught part held with the unbelieving Jews that the apostles were spreading some sort of heresy in part with the apostles that the gospel message in fact was true and when there was an assault made now uh I'm not sure if he's speaking in legal terms but but in our country if a person is charged with assault they don't have to touch you if they touch you that's battery assault is getting in your face when there was an assault made an attempt to violently attack the apostles both of the Gentiles and also of the Jews with their rulers religious and Civil Authorities to use them despitefully means to mistreat or abuse them and even to Stone them so they had this intent to really do harm but they Solomon Barnabas were aware that they became aware they found out they learned of it and fled they fled remember Joseph had a dream at night and the angel came to him and said flee because herod's going to kill that baby so they fled they got out of there they didn't walk slowly they escaped from Iconium until last written Derby cities of lycunia and then to the region that lieth round about the neighboring districts but were they intimidated there they continued to preach the gospel so here I realize that this big Arrow they're not in a boat out here it's just helping you see this little arrow up here going from myconium to lyster that's that's only about 20 miles everybody's absorbed that Geographic data from the map will continue on and there somewhere in town sat a certain man at lystra impotent in his feet being a nowadays we'd say having a Mobility handicap or perhaps just disabled or with a disability from his mother's womb in other words it's a birth defect he'd never walked never it reminds us of the man at Jerusalem at the gate called Beautiful who also had deformed feet from birth the same heard Paul speak we don't know what he's saying except we know it was the Gospel but it seems likely that he was testifying of some of the miraculous healings the way that the Lord had been backing up the gospel that they're sharing personally I think while he was talking he saw this man felt a nudge from the Holy Spirit and perhaps witnessed about that healing at the beautiful gate but we do read that Paul steadfastly beholding him just like I'm looking at Amos steadfastly beholding him perceiving that he had Faith to be healed response to what he was hearing Paul preach and testify Paul said with a loud voice to the man with deformed feet stand upright On My Feet and he he the lame man who had never never was leg muscles were undoubtedly atrophied I've shared you the testimony of what happened to me when I was just bedridden for a few weeks he didn't slow around him we're told that he leaped heaped up and he walked I want to shift gears here just for a moment and go back to this is 2023 let's go back 50 years to 1973. little personal testimonial I was in the Army at that time I'd been drafted in December of 72 and uh uh so I was off at Fort Ord California and in January late January of 1973 a sister Grace evenly came and visited Tucson she her testimony is in the back of this book the 11th commandment she was uh given up to die by um Mayo Clinic and she was just just at the end just at the end she felt that if she could get to one of brother Brown's meetings that she'd be healed her husband to challenge her about that and that's what she'd said they they made they found out about a meeting they lived up in Sault Ste Marie Michigan in that area came down to Chicago while they were checking into the hotel somebody robbed everything out of their car so she was in this meeting and and she she when she came to Tucson I was in the Army she stayed with my wife she stayed with Heather in the trailer that we were renting at that time and so sister Grace was there for a few weeks and uh and she shared this testimony you said you know when you're laying down and and you get up you know you push yourself up if you're getting out of bed or you roll or you do something you assist yourself you couldn't do that but one moment she was laying on this cot and the prayer was made for her and instantly she was on her feet instantly she was on her feet this didn't just happen in the book of Acts this didn't just happen in Acts 9 or acts 5 or in uh in in Acts 14. this happened in 1955 or 56 in brother branham's in meetings and and it happened in this room right over here I remember Sister Sammy Allen was in a similar situation and and she'd been brought to church into cot she was in the fellowship hall there while the service was going on and God touched her she was on her feet and that was just a few years ago in this very building Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today forever he still responds to Faith when the people saw what Paul had done not just heard what he said let's I'd like to just pause another moment like Peter and John at their beautiful gate in Jerusalem this miraculous healing took place in public and the presence of Skeptics the benefit wasn't just or even primarily for the one that was healed but a public witness of the Gospel of the grace and power of God when the people saw what God had done through Paul they the the people the not yet believing multitude lifted up their voices they were excited loudly proclaiming saying in the speech of like cornea whatever that speech is their local dialect which could be why Paul and Barnabas didn't immediately respond had it been in Hebrew or Greek or some other language they were familiar with they might have said something sooner but they said and they proclaimed that gods are come down to us and the likeness of men these aren't men as they appear to be they must be divine beings part of the pantheon of Olympus a similar response to the crowd of caesarea that heard Eric gripper speak back in Acts 12. but in this case it it wasn't while wearing a silver robe Seated on the throne making self-againizing statements it was the miraculous healing you'll notice throughout acts that healings aren't done in prayer lines in churches they're far more public and draw attention to God's word and power and Truth testifying and backing the words that are being spoken and witnessed to the lost and dying amen spreading the gospel and they call Barnabas Jupiter that's the chief God Zeus to the Greeks and Paul mccurious Mercury Hermes in in Greek the messenger because he was the chief speaker well then the priest of Jupiter the Temple of which was before their City it hit the entrance by the gate brought oxen and garlands unto the gates and would have done sacrifice he intended to do sacrifice to Barnabas and Paul with the people they were excited Jupiter has come down Among Us which when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it when they understood what was really going on and they saw this escalation of this misunderstanding of the people they tore their clothes it was an expression of grief of oh no it might have been their only clothes they weren't carrying a big suitcase right and they ran out among the people crying out and saying sirs why do ye these things we also are men of like passions with you preach unto you that you should turn from these vanities unto the Living God which made Heaven and Earth the sea and everything that's in them when times passed suffered All Nations to walk in their own ways but not anymore nevertheless he left not himself without witness and that he did good gave us rain from Heaven fruitful Seasons filling our hearts with food and gladness and with these sayings scarce restrained they the people that they had not done sacrifice unto them put yourself in that position you worship this Pantheon of gods your Pagan background you know nothing about Jesus Christ but what these two guys have been telling you about you've seen this miracle well you know very well that no man can heal a lame person just by telling him something and he pops up to his feet nobody can do that it's not possible so it has to be divine power has to be what else could it be and how could divine power live in a human unless a human were divine we saw the Same Spirit worshiping a man a vessel used by God and brother branham's Ministry sadly we still see people deceived by this very Spirit today well there came thither to lystra certain Jews from Antioch of facidia that had driven them out and Iconium 20 miles away who had tried to do them severe harm and with eloquent words they persuaded the people the people who had recently wanted to worship Paul and Barnabas as gods but we're now ready to kill them as imposters destroyers of the way of life demons or devils and having stoned Paul they didn't just threaten they acted and they acted so quickly and vehemently that there was no way to escape as he had done years earlier in Damascus let down over the wall in a basket or recently an Antioch of basidia it was these angry people from that Antioch who appear to have been instrumental in this action they were a little bit like Saul before the road to Damascus they stoned Paul inside the city unlike Stephen and they drew him they dragged his lifeless body out of the city supposing he'd been dead why did they suppose he was dead because he was they killed him well why do you say that Brenda Lyle stoning is not tossing pebbles at somebody it's not trying to chase them away it's grabbing big rocks and smashing skulls smashing bones breaking ribs mangling bodies blunt force trauma if this nowadays people might use an aluminum baseball bat Paul was dead you don't have to take my word for it brother Brandon said he was dead so this I this is one of the most amazing things to me how be it as the disciples stood around about him now who are these disciples what have they been here in here that Jesus rose from the dead that he's alive they'd seen miracles well if he's alive and raises people and this is his speaker his messenger this guy this well if he can raise himself from the dead a few years ago he can certainly raise this man from the dead they weren't going how sad though let's let's give them a decent burial let's get some nice flowers for his funeral they weren't just standing around him they were praying for his life to return and again brother Branham explains that they did this at huge personal risk they had faith and they had expectation and they stayed there until Paul rose up now this is uh well speculation on my part let me stand aside about 14 years from the time of this event Paul wrote to the in second Corinthians and he told about going to the third heaven and seeing things that he just couldn't describe brother random talked about going to what he called the first heaven when he had that Vision be or that experience beyond the curtain of time we know that when Stephen was stoned he had a vision of Heaven he saw Jesus standing around and and he he mentioned that Vision that he was having as his life was passing away Paul said I don't know if I was alive or dead I don't know if I was in the body or not but I had this experience he wrote about it 14 years after this and when he wrote about it he said it was 14 years ago was it this experience we don't know but it might have been it might have been and where did Paul go anywhere but lystra that's where they just killed him no he returned to lystra he was just outside of it he came to the city and the next day probably still bloodied and bruised in pain likely traveling on foot he departed with Barnabas to Derby Derby will be the end point of their journey I was thinking about this and realizing that Paul was martyred twice he died twice for the witness of the Gospel once right here and later in Rome when he was beheaded so here we see going from Iconium or from lystra to Derby that's their next stop and it's the last stop it's about 60 miles I've pointed out galatia before Leicester and Derby you're also in the in this region along with Antioch and Iconium we're going to come to these towns a little bit later this evening when we read a witness from from another New Testament Source Peter and and and we'll we'll find out a couple of the chapters down that there's a couple of ladies of faith that lived in this area we don't know which of those towns maybe it was in the region in between but there was a lady named Lois she had her daughter named Eunice Eunice and her Greek husband had a son timothius and acts 16 we'll see Paul revisit lystra and Derby and take on timotheus Timothy as a companion during that journey of evangelism eventually two of the letters that we have preserved in our new testament in the Bible are letters that Paul wrote to this young man first and second Timothy and what many believe are either his first or second epistle will be written to the churches in the book of Galatians there's another thing that just happened here in lystra until now Paul's managed to escape physical persecution we read in Acts 9 25 that he was Lord in a basket outside the wall of the city of Damascus to escape those lying in wait at the gates the governor of the of Damascus was in on that at the end of Acts 13 He and Barnabas were chased out of the city of Antioch of basidia we read in Acts 14 6 just a few minutes ago how Paul and Barnabas escaped the crowd that wanted to Stone them in Iconium but now Paul is seized he's stoned to death his bodies dragged out of the city of lystra I think he was expecting this sort of thing he wouldn't always be able to escape or Dodge we read about his Damascus Road experience in Acts 9. let's revisit that for a moment the Lord told a fellow named ananias to go to Saul and and at 9 13 ananias answered oh Lord I've heard by many of this man how much evil he has done to thy Saints at Jerusalem and here he has Authority from the chief priest to bind all that call on thy name you really want me to go see this guy but the Lord said unto him ananias go thy way he's a chosen vessel onto him unto me bear my name before the Gentiles and Kings and the children of Israel for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake I think Paul saw it coming lyster would just be the beginning as I said Paul will die twice for the gospel and in second Corinthians 11 and 12 he lists a lot of the difficulties that he faced well let's get back to Acts 14. and one day Paul and Barnabas had preached the gospel to that City Derby and they're taught many of apparently with success without being attacked and it's likely that buried in that simple sentence Eunice and Timothy heard the gospel for the first time along with Grandma Lois after preaching and teaching in Derby they Paul and Barnabas started the long journey home they returned again to lystra that's 60 miles they're backtracking it remember Paul was brutally attacked he was killed by stoning in lystra Dakota bypass it gone directly to Iconium they could have gone East from Derby and made the way Overland to Tarsus and back home that way taking the short path voided all the places where they'd had trouble but they didn't they didn't take the easy route they didn't take the less risky route they had recent converts in lystra and Iconium and they refused to be deterred from verifying that they were continuing in the faith they wanted to verify that the word had taken effect in their life that they were filled with the holy spirit that they were continuing on in faith I imagine put yourself in the place of one of those that had participating in the stoning of Paul and Iconium I imagine there were a lot of shocked people in lystra when this dead guy walked back into town some weeks or months later I thought it was just a rumor those guys had snatched his body and buried it and made up a story but look here he is maybe witty was telling us about Jesus rising from the dead was true what a witness that would have been in that town to those people from Leicester they continue to Iconium another 20 miles and to Antioch of basidia another approximately 80 miles their return journey is is in these little dotted lines that are hard to see up here the dotted red so I made big dotted red arrows to help you find the little dotted lines so that's the return Journey Derby to Antioch of pasidia of verse 21. and what did they do in each of these towns and cities along the way the places they'd preach the gospel of Salvation to Jew and Gentile alike at Great risk danger cost they were confirming re-establishing so strengthening The Souls of the disciples the Believers those who had accepted the message of grace through the Gospel of Jesus Christ these these new these new apprentices of the faith and exhorting encouraging that the root of the word exhorting is to draw near to invite to comfort exhorting them to continue in the faith and telling them we must go through much tribulation hardships persecution anguish trouble burdens to enter into the kingdom of God these people were Witnesses of the terrible persecution and suffering of Paul and Barnabas it's not Theory from a textbook this is witnessed experience among these very converts to Christ this isn't look what's happening in China look what's happening in Ukraine this isn't their time and when they Paul and Barnabas had ordained them elders and every Church in each church assembly and had prayed with fasting they commended they presented they committed them to the Lord on whom they believed and whom their faith was placed ordained them Elders in every Church what does this verse mean what does that mean it's easy to just read through it or pass it and make an assumption but our pastor has told us if you're reading and you run across something in a verse be sure you understand it before you read the next verse so let's dig into this a little bit grab your shovels let's dig what is this word ordained other translations say appointed that particular Greek word means to stretch the hand some take this to mean voting but in this passage today is Paul and Barnabas so if they're voting they're the only two guys with votes the specific Greek word only appears twice in the entire New Testament the other place is second Corinthians 8 19. Paul is commending Titus to the church at Corinth he says who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this Grace so the word translator ordained in Acts 14 is translated chosen in second Corinthians 8. in this case Paul and Barnabas are appointing elders and every Church in Derby lystra Iconium antiochrophicidia and so forth say okay so they appointed these peoples but then you have to ask what is an elder what is an elder the word translated Elder like most words has many meanings God told Rebecca that she would have twins the Elder would serve the younger and in this case it's simply a matter of birth order of age same meaning as older but but this term can also mean one who has respect or who has Authority not necessarily new to age let's turn to First Peter chapter 5 for some illumination on this from the Bible and I'll read a brief excerpt from a sermon of brother Branham on this topic but before we go to First Peter chapter five we need to understand who Peter is addressing in this Epistle of First Peter who is his audience First Peter 1 1 tells us Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ to The Strangers scattered strangers now these These are believers that he had not personally met he doesn't know them so they're strange scattered throughout pontus galatia Cappadocia Asia and bythinia we'll get to that in a moment that these strangers are elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ he says to you those strangers to whom that applies Grace unto you and peace be multiplied so we're back to our map so this is where Peter sent the letter i underlined them to pontus galatia Asia galatia so he's writing to what we would call Turkey to all of these regions here and I've marked with little uh red ovals here these four cities that we've been reading about in galatia Derby and Iconium and lystra and Antioch of pasidia there's writing to these very elders he's addressing these very people that Paul and Barnabas have just appointed so knowing the location let's find out what Peter describes as an elder in chapter 5 first Peter 5 1 he says the elders which are among you so this is just the whole church but now he's getting specific so I exhort I encourage I entreat I beseech who also am an elder I Peter I'm an elder too I'm one of you in Michael and not only that I'm a personal witness of the servings of Christ and also will be along with you a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed so to you Elders I exhort you to do the following feed the flock of God which is among you taking the oversight thereof the responsibility you have positions of responsibility you have positions of leadership not by constraint not because you must or you're being forced to but willingly out of love compassion concern Desiring to fulfill your calling as unto Christ himself not for filthy Luke or not for money it's not a job or a job description not as a hireling it's a calling but instead of a ready mind that means with enthusiasm eager to serve neither is being Lords over God's Heritage this isn't the concept of of what Jesus told his disciples he's its greatest among you must be servant of all not toward and over everybody remember when brother Aaron was asking God when he was filling the role of Pastor Here For Those Years while we were searching and ask God what's Pastor what what is this all about and the Lord told him the Sheep are Gods they're not the pastors but being examples to the flock lead by example not by dictate and when the chief Shepherd Jesus shall appear you shall receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away likewise younger submit yourselves under the Elder I think it's a bit of a double entender here not exactly a pun but but he's telling the younger ones to listen to the older ones but also to the Elder of the church yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed clothed enclosed wrapped surrounded never appear naked never appear without being clothed with humility for God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble not false humility but Junior wines up here we see Peter has described the role or the position of an elder now brother branham's comment I want to read to you is from Hebrews chapter 5 and 6 number 1 1957. yeah I know the type's a little bit small again if you sit closer to the front seizure to read but I believe and the supreme authority of the local assembly yes Let each Church be its own choose its pastors it's deacons it's whatever it is and then that way the man in there has no Bishop over him the Holy Spirit wants to speak something to that church they don't have to ask anybody about whether they could do this or do that it's the individual in contact with the Holy Spirit and then Berta Brandon puts out a challenge show me by the Bible what's greater in the Bible than a local Elder to a local church that's right yes sir the sovereignty of the local church each Church in itself now Brotherhood that's wonderful all churches ought to be in a brotherhood like that together like the ministers meeting we were in Phoenix on Saturday but the sovereignty of the local church we don't answer to that group but we desire to be in Fellowship as as brothers and sisters and with our sister churches go back to the closing verses of Acts 14. and after they Paul and Barnabas had passed through the region of facilia they came to the next region pamphylia and when they Paul and Barnabas had preached the word in perga so this is another 96 miles 100 miles or so from from Antioch it's a town they first came to from Cyprus a year or two earlier a place from which John Mark had left them to go back to Jerusalem they went down to the port city of Italia another 10 miles don't confuse that with Italy it's not Italy it's a town so you can see this they've come from Antioch down to ferga and now right here to this little Port City of Italia and since from that Port of Italia they sailed to Antioch about 300 miles from once they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled it's a I'm sorry I'm not sorry I'm going to share it with you anyway they've taken 72 verses to get from from Antioch of Syria to Derby they've taken five verses to get home you ever notice how when you're going home you just really want to get home like I remember one time we had a horse that we had purchased for our oldest son and we kept them over brother mcclintocks because we couldn't keep a horse at our place and we went over there and this was this was about 1982 or three something like that and and this horse was a was a retired barrel racer and and uh and so we took her down to a to a place to for the kids to ride the horse because that's why you have a horse and feed her all that hay and knock out the Stalls so you can ride it right so our daughter Gloria was perched on this pretty good-sized horse I don't know how many hands the horse was I had four Hooves I don't know how many hands in it but but Gloria's perched on this horse and she's she's about five years old or maybe she's six but I think she's about five and the horse is going around and then realizing that wait Stables right back over there there might be hey there so as soon as the horse was pointed I've done 72 verses I'm going to do five verses now the horse took off through the desert oh no I mean Gloria's feet didn't reach the stirrups right she's just perched on the saddle holding the reins and Nikki is that's the name of the horse is charging back across the desert and we're looking and chasing and we see Gloria and we think boy she's going to land in a cactus what's happened to our precious daughter we go running up to her and Gloria was typical Gloria she was up Nikki ran away so I jumped well I that's not very spiritual but I had to share that with you so so here's a map of their of their whole journey from from where they started to where they came back and and all of this uh all of that you're seeing here is is this last part of the journey we've read about in Acts 14. they've been gone for about two years according to most estimates they didn't travel in airplanes trains or buses they didn't have air-conditioned hotels to sleep in nice restaurants to eat in churches along the way to support them they didn't have access to API ATMs to withdraw funds no credit cards no telephones no telegraphs no internet No cameras to take pictures or videos to share with the folks back home no big suitcases with wheels to take the Wardrobe that they need to be gone for two years through heat and cold through desert and Mountain through snow every kind of climate you can imagine there in southern turkey is pretty harsh pretty extreme dry and damp and wet All Seasons inclined no consulates from which they could seek help if the local authorities gave them a hard time no hot showers no shampoo no body wash no recordings of sermons to listen to and be inspired by no music players not even Bibles to carry around and mark up or read no skulls or code disease the New Testament didn't exist these are the people that wrote it they hadn't written it yet not even the four gospel accounts they were preaching the gospel winning converts in hostile places using scriptures from what we call the Old Testament and most of that was recitation for memory if they were in a synagogue and the synagogue happened to have this goal of the Prophet or the or whatever they were reading then they could read it but synagogues didn't have a complete set of Scrolls a very very very expensive so what they had was what they could remember from what we call the Old Testament and the moving of the spirit backing up what they were saying because they were saying something very new what are our excuses I have I don't have an excuse don't talk to me about America in 1957. I think nearly everybody in this audience came to Christ after 1957. that what brother Brandon said about 1957 it's true and it was true back then but this is 60 years later don't talk to me about 1963 or 1965. if you have breath in your body and if your body is still aging then we have one task and we've been commanded to do that by Jesus himself spread the gospel it's too hard it's too hard Jesus specific words to the lukewarm last age be zealous therefore and repent the musicians could please return but the last two verses acts 14 when they were come and had gathered the church together they rehearsed all that God had done with them how we had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles first Peter with Cornelius group in caesarea now Paul and Barnabas in the various cities of pamphilia pasidia galatio what is now Southern turkey it's a partial fulfillment of ananias word from the Lord that we read in Acts 9 15. Saul's a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and children of Israel and there an Antioch of Syria they Poland barnabis Abode a long time months years with the disciples that's the complete acts 13 and 14. my brothers and sisters in Christ let's spread the gospel be like those early Christians if we could pray together one more time Lord Jesus it's encouraging and it's challenging and it's sobering to read about the sacrifices that were made by these early Christians going out just with your word that said go and you went with them Lord and and miraculous things happen wonderful things happen we're here today but because of what they did because of what you did through them help us Lord help me Lord to not just say things but to do things Lord help us all to be doers of the word to express your love to this generation we see around us that is dying and lost help us Lord we commit ourselves again to you in Jesus precious name I wonder as we turn this service over to our pastor I'd like to sing an old gospel song It Was Written there are various things say 1887 or 1890. it's called send the light I think you may be familiar with it there's a call I'm sorry there's a call comes ringing or the Restless waves and the light send the light there are souls to rescue there are souls to save send the light send the light send the light the Blessed Gospel Light Let It Shine from Shore to Shore [Music] white Let It Shine forevermore [Music] [Music] Let It Shine [Music] [Applause] let it shine forever Grace [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] Let It Shine [Music] forevermore saw the map that our brother Paul and brother Barnabas how much they went around and they they traveled all those miles and I think and as brotherly I was speaking I was I was thinking that that was a time past all of those dangers that they faced and all that they did that was for a Time past but preaching the gospel is more needed today than it was at that time back then but Lewis we don't have to go to Congo we can spread the gospel right here we can spread the gospel to our neighbors we can spread the gospel to our friends to the students at school we can spread this same gospel that they spread and as our brother said every miracle that happened whether it was raising up from the dead whether was healing a Layman whatever it was it was for one purpose and that was to preach the gospel because those people every single single one of them that rose up whether it be crippled or whether they be dead they all died again but if they got got that gospel they they have eternal life and they will never die god brother Lewis if you come up and enclose my brother I want to read a quote real quick brother Lyle I fact checked him this is this is what brother Branham said in 1956 December 30th he said speaking of what he said about Paul and how Paul was stoned he said this we believe by faith we receive it but if the brother not disputing with him I don't believe that but if the brother would have only read that how Paul was stoned to death and the Saints stood over him and prayed till they come back to till life come back into him amen our brother our brother Paul went through a hard time but I promise you brother Jeremy it was worth every single moment everything that he did it was it was worth every every step every mile every storm on the ship it was worth it all and Friends it is worth it to us to witness about this gospel that Jesus Christ saves that he heals and he will be for there for us when we crossed into the oversight other side if we will just believe on him brother can you just say a few words or just whatever you have on your heart brother Lewis good to see you praise the Lord surely we can say that the Lord has been so good to us and we go to the house of the Lord we we are coming under the expectation and that can just say thank you to from the bottom of my heart because the voice of God still a living voice we can surely say what a responsibility when we hear this gospel and our Prophet said we have more responsibility

will but I'm going to church under the expectation and I just want a God to speak to me surely I said the Lord spoke in my heart and I say thank you so much thank you richly being able to obey to the voice of God that God has used a precious brother as a vessel maybe it was not for you but I can say 100 percent it was mine when it was for all of us you know what the prophet said if you cannot go
