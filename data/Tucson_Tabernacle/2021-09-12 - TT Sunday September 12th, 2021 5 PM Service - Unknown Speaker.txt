thought lord to be white as snow for there perhaps there's those in the building tonight that know what it is to look over fresh fallen snow and the countryside just white pure white many times we've looked at that lord marveled at your promise [Music] and you said come unto me let us reason together let's talk let's have a little fellowship perhaps i can help you to understand that though your sins be scarlet you shall be white as snow we just so love you tonight lord so respect your presence with us it's our desire lord that in the fellowship tonight that you'd come and just have preeminence that you'd be pleased to speak to our hearts and that when we leave lord we be better servants more in love with you lord a fire burning in our heart and a love affair that's stirred with you your word and something that would cause us to be a value up and doing lord perhaps some troubled soul we could be a hell lead them to you lord we want to commit the service this evening into your hands lord your word and we reverently approach it and ask you to bring to us the things that you'd have for us tonight lord we ask it in jesus name amen amen god bless you tonight i'd like to read a very familiar scripture i trust that it's not too redundant for you and it's found in the book of matthew in the 16th chapter and the eighth verse and it's a very well-known dialogue between jesus and that's why many people don't turn in their bibles these days is the scriptures are up there and i just wanted to see what was on the screen to see if it was if it was already on there matthew the 16th chapter and the 13th verse when jesus came into the coast of caesarea of philippi he asked the disciples saying who do men say that i the son of man am and they said some say that thou art john the baptist some elijah and others jeremiah or one of the prophets and he said unto them but whom say ye that i am and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god. and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee that thou art peter or petros a little rock and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it may the lord bless his word you may be seated if the lord helped us tonight i had a little thought on my heart that came to me while i was working and that is a stand alone testimony man is a is a social creature and god made us that way too no man is an island we we need each other and uh paul in his letters to the church he always admonished to have uh a burden for others and to be part of a body and uh he gave many instructions of of how to handle our lives with one another and and uh knowing that we would be uh his family in the lord and and so we read this morning how brother branham said each person receives the holy spirit and every person seeks out their own salvation with fear and trembling and then each person brings their experience with the lord and their surrendering to the lord and and being baptized into the body by his spirit which is the new birth and then collectively we become the body of christ and so peter in this scripture which we're all very familiar with he the lord is isolating the disciples and saying you know it's one thing to kind of make a general statement of who does man say that i am but now what is your revelation or you know speak from your own heart and so when peter spoke it it seems like a little contradiction in scripture here because jesus said who do men say that i the son of man him and then when peter gave his answer he said thou art the son of god and he said to peter he said flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee in other words your brain your intellect didn't give you this understanding nor did other flesh and blood and some other teacher or or some bible school or or some learned man or theologian that's not how you got that peter but god because he is god and because he can quicken his word to us he said to peter he said god gave you that revelation and it's a wonderful thing when when you have a revelation it you know it's been something that's been made real to you so brother branham said that the atonement he said everything hinges on your attitude toward the atonement and i think we've spoken here before and i don't mean to tire you but i had been very surprised in preaching around the country how how very little many believers know about what the word atonement means it's very beautiful to if you want to see something that's edifying i saw a little piece about the bible it's on youtube it's called the battle of the bible and it talks about the english translation of the bible and it gives such a portrayal of the price that was paid for us to have the bible in english and that these men gave their lives and they suffered and they they they paid the ultimate price they they gave everything that we could read this in our in our language and how often we we just take it uh for granted but that word atonement means at one meant and it's a word that came into being at the uh translation of the bible it's the when god and man become one and we know that in the old testament that there were many sacrifices that were made during the year but first sin offerings and thanksgiving offerings and different sacrifices made but one day and only one day in the year the high priest went behind the veil took the blood of the sacrifices and went behind the veil and that was the day of atonement so all of these other sacrifices and things were just temporarily temporary until that day and and that's something that you can find in uh the book of hebrews i believe that's the ninth chapter brother branham i mean brother paul explains these stages that the priest would do this here in this part of the temple but only on that day would the priest enter the holiest of holies and that was all a picture of christ going in behind the veil for us and offering the ultimate sacrifice so that day of atonement was in reality what paul was bringing us to was that jesus offered himself as a sacrifice he was the ultimate sacrifice and he wasn't just bringing the blood of a of a sacrifice but he was bringing his own blood he was sacrificing his own life he was giving himself to be that once and for all sacrifice and now that is the atonement so that's the true day of atonement for the believer when you accept that atonement for your sins that's the answer to the sin question does the sin question go away no the sin question always badgers you you know if you love god why did you do that if you believe why did you do something contrary to your testimony and and the bible says that satan is an accuser of the brethren he accuses the the brethren night and day before the father so it's a nonstop that's why you can wake up in the middle of the night and feel afraid and feel like you're in trouble and then you've got to say no no lord i'm under your wing i'm trusting in you that you've made the atonement for me whatever it is that's troubling me it's it's under your care because you made that sacrifice one time for me i'm resting in the atonement now the statement that brother branham made was that it's your attitude toward the atonement that brings the blessing to you so you can god can make this atonement but until you embrace it and make it yours it's not going to do you any good now this was the challenge that jesus was putting to peter said who do you say that i am and he called peter a little stone and the church world put the two together and said okay stone building upon this stone i'll build my church and they had their interpretation of the word but brother brown said no he didn't build the church on peter just because he called him a little stone and he said he said upon this rock i'll build my church what jesus was referring to was the revelation of who jesus is in other words peter took that that god had given him he said thou art the christ you're the messiah you are that one that all the prophets and sages and that we've all looked for that emmanuel would come would be god with us we believe that you are that one and jesus said that didn't come out of your intellect that came from god and upon that revelation of who i am when that becomes real to you then that's what god builds his church on is when you have a revelation of what jesus is to you then all hail hell will try to fight that but it's real to you and it's just astounding to me how that so often phrases are so common and at the same time so foreign in to people so often heard but when the individual hears it they they have a little question in their mind like what is that and and maybe this is elementary to you but my children often say when i explained things they said yeah dad we got it we got it you know you don't need to go on we got it one of my sons in a building project i i i knew that that that's the predominating uh theme is that we got this dad so i just said uh um well did you want to entertain any questions can i could i ask a few things have you considered this you know can i can i just ask you a couple questions on this project if you know just for my own comfort he said no yeah i got it so but even the word revelation sometimes people think it's very supernatural but it's when god makes something real to you you know get a flat tire out in the middle of nowhere and go to the trunk to see you know what condition your spare is in and you might get a very sad revelation you know you thought yeah i believe in spares right okay well a flat one isn't really a spare so then by that experience this becomes a revelation to you that hey if i'm going on this big trip check the tire and it just becomes real to you and and that that seems like a very simplistic uh ideology or or something to say but it goes very much along with how simple this thought when i was doing some landscaping which i normally don't do and building some rock what they call rip-rap rock walls where you just take stones by hand and you stack them up and you make a wall to retain when a landscape changes elevations and so if you get to doing this and then also if your landscape needs to look good this wall needs to look like it's permanent and it needs to be somehow kind of appealing to the eye while you're building there's things going through your mind and you're picking up these rocks and you're saying okay this rock is going to bridge between these two rocks and this rock will be a good stop st stacker to to lift my height and and and and you know somebody would think you're crazy but you start picking up every rock and this each rock has a certain kind of characteristic and you pick up one and you say no you're not that kind of rock and and you put another one and then you get your wall built and now your artistry has to come to a place where there's going to be one large-sized rock or a pair of them or three that is exposed because they're only there now you've accomplished your retention you you've done what you had but now this needs to look nice and maybe you'll have one place where you'll just put one rock and that has to be a stand-alone rock and you think a stand-alone rock what what would a stand-alone rock be well a standalone rock is big enough that it looks substantial but small enough that you don't get a hernia moving it and it has to have some kind of a characteristic some interest that it doesn't just look like a common boulder and it in it and it has to look like it belongs there and you set the rock there and you say now that's a standalone rock that's finished that rock itself because of what it is it doesn't need another rock to go with it it doesn't need other rocks to support it it it's not leaning against the others or you know it's not one of those rocks that you keyed into a certain hole it's just a stand-alone rock and you would say well brother dennis you're really stretching this but i thought what about a standalone testimony you know many times as social creatures we're always trying to figure out where we fit you know what's my place in this and they're like this and i'm here and what's my relationship here and you were always trying to you know figure out our place but do you have a standalone testimony where you're taken out of the church out of the family out of your marriage i'm not advocating to take anybody out of their marriage but but let's take you as a believer out of your unit do you have a standalone testimony who are you and what is your testimony if if you just the man on the street doesn't know who you're related to what your last name is where you go to church what you believe if you believe the message of the hour that you're a christian that you're uh all of these things but when they get to talking to you and say who are you you say well this is what i'm about this is the real me this is what i'm living for this is what makes me tick and jesus demanded that of peter of of what's going on inside of you peter and there's an interesting scripture in hebrews 9 where paul talks about the death of the testator you ever heard that expression or how many here would say i've heard that expression in hebrews it's in hebrews 9 and paul is rehearsing with the believers how that there was always with remission of sins with the taking away of sin with the forgiveness of sin there was always blood associated and the first time that god's children in the garden sinned god gave them skins now adam and eve made aprons of fig leaves because their transgression and their sin made them know that they were naked so they took fig leaves and they tried to cover themselves and that's what religion is as a covering but god didn't accept that and he gave them skins which signified that something had died that there had been the shedding of blood and all through the old testament when there was remission of sins there was always the shedding of blood an innocent lamb or moloch was the sacrifice for sin so that was a commonly understood concept but now paul is introducing that it's not a bull or an animal but it was god coming down and tabernacling in flesh to become the sacrifice that would be made once and for all and he says in hebrews 9 and 13 for if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of an heifer sprinkled the unclean sanctify to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god very interesting this word dead works because paul in another place he talks about all of these sacrifices that could never make you clean now dead works are things outside of this sacrifice that men try to do to make themselves clean or to make themselves worthy or to make themselves holy and man can do nothing brother abraham said the the thief on the cross was god showing that when jesus said today you'll be with me in paradise was to to show that there was nothing that man could do not one work that you can do to merit your salvation or to make yourself cleaner or more holy our holiness comes from being in christ and from accepting the sacrifice that he made and so any other things are dead works there there's no life in that and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament oh my how much the intellect likes to stay under the first testament because the first testament is like these scales you know and it's weighing everything and it says i i lived next to a man and this is actually their doctrine is that you did good so put the good that you did over here and the bad that you did over here and you kind of weigh that out and it's all kind of a judgment thing and put everything on the scale now how many people do that to themselves in their own mind before god and they say well lord you know i fell down and i you know my thoughts went south and i didn't do right and i lost my temper and it's gone over here you know they said yeah but i read my bible and i prayed and i repented and and i've been trying to do better lord and you know it's always this kind of a thing self analysis self justice self this it's that's the first testimony that's the first testament you know that's the commandments do these commandments and you shall live and don't do them and and and you're going to have the wrath of god and it's just a law you know more over here and less over here the scales are going to do that there's just this law but when jesus came he brought a new testament and said i'm going to make a sacrifice once and for all we're not going there anymore i'm going to settle the sin question i'm going to forgive your iniquities and i'm going to make an attorney and i'm going to satisfy that law once and for all and then i'm going to make a new testament i'm going to show you a new and living way a different way of life that is not this but that is resting secured in christ the mark of a mature christian is rest and all of this in hebrews earlier in the chapters and i'm sorry to be so stuck on hebrews you forgive me it's just been where i where i've been lately because we're in a little bible study about it but if you look earlier in in hebrews paul's saying why didn't they enter into the promised land why did all that generation die in the wilderness because they couldn't enter in because of unbelief and he's talking about physically the promised land that moses brought them through the red sea they they went through the wilderness and they got ready to come into the promised land and somebody raised up and says well we're like grasshoppers in their sights there's giants we can't do it and they wouldn't enter in because why they they didn't have faith they didn't believe the word of god god promised that i'm going to be full i'm going to go before you and you're going to take the land and where your steps trod you're going to possess that and they didn't believe and paul said they couldn't enter in because of unbelief and now paul is speaking of not a natural land because he said when you come into this land you're not going to be slaves anymore you're not going to be beaten down and but you are going to have your own land you're going to grow your own fruit trees you're go you're going to possess it yourself and you're going to have rest in this land from your enemies all around you and from the tyranny of egypt and this will be a land of rest for you that was just a natural type of the spiritual type of when jesus came and made the atonement for sin if you can receive it if you can believe it if if if if you can take it to yourself as your own your attitude toward the atonement it brings you into this rest because jesus is our sabbath and our resting place and how do you enter in there by faith in that atonement you enter into that rest that it's not based on my works anymore it's not even based in what i can understand in the message of the hour it's based on me resting in christ he is my sabbath i have a precious man i met on vacation he's seventh day adventist and you know they're just so stuck on that saturday is that's the mark of the beast you know is those that keep the sabbath and those who don't that's going to separate them and there's you know old testament scriptures and things in revelation that but christ is our sabbath it's not a day it's not sunday and it's not saturday it's being in christ that's our sabbath remember how brother branham said in the church age book it's so beautiful i have loved the church age book for so many years just such a beautiful thing that god afforded for us and he says john says when he went on the isle of patmos he said i was in the spirit on the lord's day and brother brown begins to talk about the lord's day and he said that wasn't sunday and it wasn't saturday the day of the lord he said this is man's day they do whatever they want with the word of god they they mishandle it they they do whatever but when the day of the lord is when when when he shall come and bring his reign when he comes and brings judgment when he comes as not as savior anymore but as judged as the wigged one that's the day of the lord and and so when john on the isle of patamos the lord was going to show him things that are to be you know he's he's taking john and showing him in symbol form the program of god and he's also showing them the future the church the seven church ages and and all of these things the things that transpire on earth the things in the heavens and and so john was in the spirit on the lord's day the day of the lord so a believer has to come to this place of rest and but for your testimony to have power paul's here in the 15th verse and he's saying and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testimony they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance verse 16 for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator for a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth now did that seem a little heavy to some of you let's go back a testament is now when you die many people will have a will a last testament a will now if my mother gave me all her earthly possessions i have four siblings in this will and then i said okay i got this will i get it all and i go to enforce that and my mother's still alive she's gonna say wait a minute now i can't enforce that testimony even if it was it's not that way but i can't enforce that while my mother's alive because while she's alive and has her right mind she can change that anytime and she can also spend it all up if she should show choose okay because it's hers i'm not going to say well you know i got this you said in the will you know you can't spend no more money mom i you know i'm in your will no that that last will and testament is of no force at all while the testator the the one who made it is alive for a testament so where there is now this is paul speaking about jesus and he's saying where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator for a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood and he goes on to say now jesus had to die to purchase this inheritance for us and to give us this testament but as i read this scripture i thought how true that is your testimony is really of no power while you live if you're just defending your rights living for yourself trying to figure out how you can get ahead in life how life can be more comfortable for you aren't you just doing what every human being is doing on earth aren't we all just trying to live a little better you know maybe trying to have a little more income and a little less work or just try to get things situated so you can be comfortable but christianity calls for a death to self a self sacrificial life that you have a purpose that doesn't center around you it centers around the will of god and your brother and sister and your fellow man it's it's a self-sacrificial life it requires for your testimony to have power it requires the death of the testator it requires that you're a man or a woman that is dead to south that they could see the life of christ in you there's a beautiful thing on the mount in i believe it's luke 9 and 31 i'll try to go there quickly on mount transfiguration when peter james and john's went up on the mount and and behold there talked with him two men which were moses and elijah's elias who appeared in glory and spake of the decease which he should accomplish at jerusalem the decease that he would accomplish it doesn't seem like much of an accomplishment to die if a person died in an accident or or you know died of an illness or something we would think of that as a defeat a tragic event but when moses and elijah talked about jesus's death at calvary they said his decease which he should accomplish and i think it's a great accomplishment for a believer to show the death of the testator and and the power of your testimony depends on that and i believe with all my heart as i get older i have a sense of urgency that concerns me about particularly young people who seem to be very self-centered and rob themselves of their own gratification because in the world that we're living in today uh i live in a college town and and you know when i'm out about working places many places are rented and they're rented by college students and you you you visit with some of these young people and they're very adventure orientated you know we we want to go everywhere and we want to kayak down a certain river in peru and we you know we want to we're we want to do these adventures and then you see that no they don't want to have they don't want to get married they don't want to have children they they don't uh they don't want commitment they don't want to enter into long-term commitments and there seems to be a very uh it doesn't seem there's much focus on a goal or a purpose other than to enjoy life and for a christian a christian is different a christian gives their heart and life to god and surrenders their life and and they are primarily concerned about their service to the lord jesus christ and then based on that they'll fit in the body they'll fit into life but they come to this surrender with the lord jesus that he will make a way he will provide he will provide a place in the body of christ in life in and and our security is in him it's not in our financial ability to you know play your cards right but we're resting in him and we're as we said this morning we are seeking first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and believing that all other things shall be added to us at 6 15 i had something on my heart also that's not exactly fit in the sermon but a standalone testimony also requires that you know where you stand and in your christian walk many times you'll get a challenge remember paul said in one of his reddit letters i marvel that you are so soon removed from your stand i can't quote it exactly if somebody's got it shout it out but he said i marvel that you're so soon removed from this standing in grace that you had that you're influenced by something else that pulls you away from your testimony i've experienced this in my life where as i've gone along and as a christian i've read my bible i'm not boasting about that i'm just saying hey i knew that how do you get more spiritual read your bible pray every day okay now a christian does that and by the grace of god i i understood that brother branham was sent of god to restore us back to the original truths of the bible and i understood revelations 10 and 7 that all the mysteries would be made known at the sounding of this angel and i knew that this angel was one of the seven stars in the hand of jesus that it spoke about in the book of revelation this isn't going to be heavy so you don't have to you know tighten your seat belts it's going to be simple but i just understood about the church ages that there was these dispensations of time and that god sent us brother branham for our dispensation of time and not to bring something that wasn't in the bible but to bring us back into the word of god so we would understand the truth that had been so perverted by religion and just bring us back to the original word so we could get the true revelation and live by it how many remember when you first started to understand about predestination big word right when brother brown said it's such a big word usually out in the meetings i don't like to use it so i use foreknowledge that god to be god he had to foreknow he had to know that you would be here when you were born he knew what color hair you'd have what color eyes you'd have and then we have examples in scriptures and a very beautiful one is in isn't it the first chapter of jeremiah if we would go there and see if the preacher's right i'm sorry to make you wait now god doesn't have a different program all the time he's not always changing things up you know maybe you have a spouse like that but god's not like that jeremiah chapter 1 and verse 4 then the word of the lord came unto me saying before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb i sanctified thee and i ordained thee a prophet unto the nations then said i oh lord god behold i cannot speak for i am a child but the lord said unto me say not i am a child for thou shalt go to all that i shall send thee and whatsoever i command thee thou shalt speak be not afraid of their faces for i am with thee to deliver thee saith the lord then the lord put forth his hand and touched my mouth and the lord said unto me behold i have put my words in thy mouth see i have this day sent thee over the nations and over the kingdoms to root out and to pull down and to destroy and to throw down and to build and to plant that's what was on god's mind and what was on jeremiah's mind man i can't even talk it's a vast difference but when i believe i was listening to a sermon of brother branham and he referred to this and i often refers to the angel visiting zachariah and telling zechariah john's name and his ministry and who he was in the scripture before the child was ever born and all john could do john was amazed he said i'm this old and elizabeth is this old and we're going to have a baby and all she could do is scratch it on the plate can you imagine when elizabeth read that she said what and she went and hid herself it was embarrassing she was old she was with child the bible says she wouldn't hit herself but the angel told zechariah all about john before he was born so we can go all through the scriptures what about the angel of the lord coming to mara moriah sampson's mother how do you say that good you're not you're not no better than i am but the angel come and said this is you're going to be you're going to have a son and this is who he's going to be and this is what he's going to do now if you can go all through the scriptures and see testimony after testimony of god's foreknowledge then when paul comes and says you were predestinated to be brought to this image of his son you were predestinated to this adoption or this maturity in christ then that word predestination isn't so big anymore because you can understand it because of foreknowledge so god knew ahead of time and then he made a plan based on his foreknowledge and he said i'm going to have a church i'm going to have a bride i'm going to have a people in the end time when things are getting so crazy i'm going to have a people that i can have a love affair with i'm going to have a bride i'm going to be able to talk to her heart and she's going to from her heart talk back to me i'm going to make her clean so she don't have to worry about sin no more she's just we're gonna be united and this is the uniting that's coming at the end time and that's what this message is bringing us to is that kind of a union with our lord and savior because the truth is being restored to us and by the grace of god we are embracing it so if you are a student of the word of god and you listen to tapes like i'm sure we all do then if something is brought that makes you say did i even have it all right from the beginning i've been there but that shouldn't happen and then when i've gone back to my bible and and and back to the tapes and back to the things brother branham said i think i said hey no i didn't have it all wrong but what is the fruits of something that comes and would try to shake you down and say you never really did understand you never had it right this this is this is way beyond all of that well i'm sorry but as a student of the word of god and i'm sure that you felt the same way god has brought us step by step in his word like brother branham said this morning you might have just enough faith to cut out that i'm saved but if you cut out that much you know that you can never be lost because it's unbecoming of god to save you knowing that he would lose you so you you know you cut out a bigger piece than you first thought because you said well i'm going to accept his blood and his forgiveness for sin and and and i'm gonna i'm gonna accept that i'm his child but as time went on you read your bible and you start figuring out that what his child is you start reading in your bible that if i'm his child then i'm heir to all things if i am a child then then i'm an heir to everything that god has promised it's it these links become inseparable and you believe one thing and you think well okay well i can believe this and you you you go to take the part that you understand for sure and you pull it and there's another link on it and it says if if you're saved then you can't be lost and if you're redeemed why did he redeem you to fill you with his spirit that his life could live in you and here's another chain and and you start to find out that you're just pulling up this big bucket of promises and you're thinking oh my goodness how long is this chain so i've experienced something in my life where a certain phrase shakes people and it's the reference to our lord jesus as the son of man who made that reference jesus who does man say that i the son of man am and i'm not trying to be complicated i'm not trying to be a teacher but i'm sharing my testimony because i feel a sense of urgency as i get older that we don't somehow drift away from the original gospel brother branham didn't preach anything but this original gospel so i believe if you read scofield's notes i think that he said that jesus referred to himself as the son of man is it 97 times now the other place in the bible that you hear this expression is over in ezekiel and the lord says to ezekiel son of man prophesy okay now let's take that expression son of man and i think we preached on it here some weeks ago is there anyone that can remember that okay all right so in the second or third chapter right in there maybe several chapters in there paul is expressing when he goes back into the old testament the the scriptures that he uses when he says who is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou visitest him all of these old testament references are to the condition of man you know that man comes up as a grass he goes back down to the earth that he's uh i know i'm rehearsing these things it feels very familiar to me whether you remember or not i vow not to preach this sermon again in the last few minutes but that the condition of man and who is man and what is man he's like an animal he dies like an animal uh the very place that he lived will deny him that he ever even existed you know build the house and do ever so great but in a certain period of time it's it's gonna lie against you and say he wasn't even here and there's so many scriptures like that i just remembered just recently reading psalms 90 is very much on that theme ecclesiastics has many chapters on that theme job was on that theme who is man okay what is man or the son of man so son of man is just a man that's born of another man it's it's he's just every man that's born that way he comes in the to into the world speaking lies his his days are numbered and the very skin rooms that are going to eat your flesh are in your body now it's it's not very flattering information but it's a very real it's it's a very real description of who we are and paul brings these prophecies about how that emmanuel that god will become man and when he was on earth he identified himself as the son of man he didn't go around and say i'm the son of god he called himself the son of man now to me this was a beautiful thing when i really studied the book of hebrews to understand that jesus was every bit man brother branham said he was tempted every way like as we are tempted even tempted with lust the first time i heard the prophet say that i i i thought that can't be so but he was every bit man and that's why he was called the son of man that's the prevailing revelation of the book of hebrews is that he became every bit man and it's supported all through the word of god because how could he be your kinsman if he was just an angel you know god kind of uh you know putting on a guy's you know going back to heaven and saying you know but he didn't he came as and lived as we are the the book of romans said he became sinful he came in sinful flesh you can't put the words but what paul is trying to show in in hebrews that he wasn't just an angel or some other kind of being but he became man kinsmen to us why because the law of redemption required a kinsmen not a distant relative not you know somebody that you had the paperwork that this is my legal guardian or something like that but but he became your kinsmen that's why this revelation of of god coming down in flesh is so important is because he had to do that to refer to to fulfill the law of a kinsmen redeemer what is another thing he had to fulfill he had to fulfill that picture of the high priest and remember in hebrews how brother paul said a priest he's got he's full of infirmity too so he can have in the temple that that priest can have compassion on those that are out of the way and he offers a sacrifice for his own sins and for your sin so he fulfills that high priest and then he had to be the first god forgive me for using the expression but some of the men would understand as the prototype of what every other would be jesus was the god man and and god was bringing forth the first son and he weighs the lord jesus christ the sheaf wasn't brother branham brother branham was waving the sheaf jesus was the first one to raise from the dead he was the first one to prove that there was eternal life in the seed so when that seed come up out of the ground that's what they did in the old testament the first seemed to come to maturity and that's a very key word there because maturity in that context isn't like us becoming mature christians that first seed that was jesus raising from the grave showing that there's death after life the same seed that went into the tomb came up again not a different one but to show that the life that he had and he waved that over the people that those that are in christ could say that same life that was in him if it be in him it will produce the same thing so brother branham was waving the sheaf of of our lord jesus christ the resurrected christ jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever the same lord jesus and in the book of acts it says this same jesus that you see that you've touched that you felt this emmanuel in a corporal body he will return in like manner at his second coming it isn't to be misunderstood that he was taken up in a cloud and he comes back as a cloud that's not right jesus doesn't come back as a cloud he comes back in a corporal body that is the second coming of the lord now for me to be a stand-alone rock i got to know what i believe and i know that the prophet has said that said that there's three comings of the lord okay he came to redeem his bride he comes to rapture his bride and he comes back with his bride to reign in a millennium there's only three comings so now that we can hammer down and that's not moving anywhere now we know that there's many appearings of the lord the lord took a pure debris gave one body to each angel and he appeared to to to abraham he appeared in that pillar of fire at the river at the ohio river it was an appearing of the lord he appeared at sam houston coliseum and had his picture taken in that light brother ram said that's the light that paul saw so throughout these scriptures when when jesus came to paul it was jesus but it wasn't another coming of the lord so there was the first advent of christ and there shall be the second advent of christ or the second coming and we know that that second coming will be in a corporal body and these are things we know for sure it's if i'm a little stoned on these points i'm a standalone rock these are things i know assuredly now moses said the lord your god will raise up a prophet like unto me now what is a prophet a prophet is a man that has the word of the lord on his lips and that's what they resented about moses they said well how is it that you think that it's all on you that only you have the word of the lord when you're just a man like us and we're all men that god can talk to and who do you say and the lord told moses separate yourself and he opened up the earth and he swallowed up all those gangsters was moses more than a man no he was the son of man not the son of man like jesus referred to himself but he was he was just a son of man he was just a man that's born a man he was just a man but but the word of the lord was on his lips and god spoke lip tier with moses and he said god said you know i'll show signs and things and speak to men in dreams but not like moses i speak lip to ear to him but that's what a prophet was a prophet had god speaking to him and so then that was god's word to the people but it was still a man so that's why when in ezekiel when god said son of man prophesy it's just hey you're a man but i'm going to put my words on your lips so moses said i'm going to raise up god's going to raise up excuse me god's going to raise up a prophet like unto me so when jesus came they went as far as to say this is a mighty prophet in other words what he speaks comes to pass they weren't ready to accept the fact that jesus was not really the son of man he was the son of god but jesus gave himself that title the son of man he said to peter who does man say i the son of man am and he talked about the son of man being lifted up i know this is it's quarter to seven now we'll try to wrap it up but he said this as as moses lifted up the serpent so shall the son of man be lifted up and they said i thought they they said the the scribes say that the messiah liveth forever who is this son of man so they're starting to recognize and trying to receive jesus as the christ but when he talked about being crucified they couldn't understand and they said well the scribes say that he liveth forever how say ye that the son of man shall be lifted up who is this son of man well they they were perplexed by jesus referring to himself as the son of man so if you're a bible reader this expression son of man should not be strange to you we know that the son of man is our lord jesus then jesus said when the son of man returns when jesus i just reading the other day in the book of oneness brother branham i'm quoting jesus said at the coming of the son of man there'll be one in the bed one shall be taken one shall be left there'll be one in the field one shall be taken at the coming of the son of man what is that the coming of the lord the second coming of christ that's what the coming of the son of man is and you say what are you trying to say brother dennis that seems so simple well brother branham refers to luke 17 30 and he talks about the revealing of the son of man that's not the coming of the son of man that's when the son of man is revealed and that is what happened in brother branham's ministry was jesus revealed himself in his word and restored the original revelation of who he is and all this bible that was this glorious wonderful book of redemption all those loose ends and mysteries were tied up and so we could see god's whole plan in this book of redemption and this ministry of brother branham's which was a prophetic ministry in other words brother branham was a man with the word of the lord on his lips and in his ministry jesus christ was revealing himself and that's what we believe we believe that it wasn't brother branham's intellect that these visions that brother branham had that wasn't brother branham that was the lord appearing in this ministry and so it wasn't the second coming of the lord it wasn't it was as we were as we have taught and are understood it is the revealing of the son of man jesus by a prophet a son of man revealing the son of man there's only one the son of man and that's an expression that jesus used of himself and so as a bible believer and christian student in a and as a private student that wants to rightly divide the word of god i am very concerned with something that would cause the believer to say did i ever have it right did i ever believe like what what's that doing to your faith the scripture says in one place that those that said the resurrection is already past overthrow the faith of some and paul said that's hayamaneas and felidus believe it yes and he said in another place he said who i have turned over to satan that they would learn not to blaspheme so i'm not enough of a of a theologian i i i don't have the power of discernment to say well you know you ever heard people they take an old uh testament story and they say well you're just jehoiada and your mind races you know like okay they've typed me as this bible character am i in trouble or what well they took the liberty to put you in a bible story do they have really the right to do that no do they know no they don't know but i as a private student of the word of god have to consider the words of paul that he said those that say the resurrection are already past he warned timothy to stay away from that and he said they overthrow the faith of son so the finish line for christians is very clear it's the coming of the lord it's the second coming of the lord we know that he came as son of man in as a prophet to israel and in his earthly journey he was referred to as son of man now what's so marvelous about it was he was the son of god it was god himself emmanuel he became so much man that he identified himself so much with man he called himself the son of man but he was god with us so in his earthly ministry he was called the son of man now in the church ages when he walked among the seven coal golden candlesticks it was christ himself but now he's resurrected and he's in his church in the form of the holy spirit and that dispensation or that time he's called the son of god son of man son of god in the church ages spirit formed tabernacling in the believers walking on in the midst of the seven can church candlesticks the same lord jesus but in a different form so they're son of man son of god and this son of god dispensation continues until he comes as son of david to establish his reign he comes back as the king he's always been the king but he didn't wear that girdle around his paths he wore it around his waist as a servant to be a priest to be an intercessor to be a savior to be a kinsman but when he comes as son of david now he's king and he's going to take his rightly brightly place and he's coming for his millennial reign to reign with his saints so son of man son of god son of david and never get your threes mixed up we we know these things so it never should be so what happens when when jesus comes his second time what happens the dead in christ race and they ask in the questions and answers they said what kind of body will we have in the resurrection and brother branham says you look it up and he says the same kind of body that jesus had when he was on earth but we'll have a glorified body when he appears we shall be like him we'll have a body like his body so at the second coming of the lord the dead in christ race and we which are alive and remain are caught up together with them to forever be with our lord now if i'm going to be a stand-alone rock i'm not being pulled from the things that god's made real to me the revelation that god gave me and that finish line for the believer is the resurrection and the rapture and that's got to be very clear in your mind that when they stretch they used to i don't know what they do now but you know when i was in high school and you ran a race they had a little ribbon across the they stretched across and when you ran across that line you tried to even put your chest out just might make the one tenth of a second come across that line well if you're a runner you're you're putting everything out to cross that line it'd be a shame to think somebody's moving it and you got to look backwards and say did i where where's that at wouldn't that be a sight to see all the runners you know they're running fast and hard and they're going to go across that finish line and then they go like where is it at did i miss it did i ever have i been running this thing right no that's not the gospel that we received the gospel will always have a clear sound i'd like to just read you a little quote in closing and i do mean closing and i'm not much of a high-tech guy but i did bring it up this afternoon and i do this because it helped me and and i feel i you know i'm i'm not so much an elder but i'm not the same young man that brother perry called up before about 600 people and asked why you didn't take communion i'm not that guy true story i think we've shared it before so let me have your attention and i'll share where this is this is in 1962 this is the message perseverance it's not showing me where it's preached but anyway it's the month of june in the eighth day 1962 perseverance just before a prayer line i can't remember you know there was probably discernment and prayer line brother adam says this did you know that the bible speaks of the appearing of the lord and also the coming of the lord and it's two different works search it and find it out if that's right the appearing and the coming is two different things the appearing of the lord is now he's appearing amongst his people we see him in his same works the appearing his holy spirit but his coming will be in a physical being it will be to catch the church up but see we've been down through the word justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost and now the church is getting in such a condition ready waiting the offices of the church is coming into place the teachers are placing the places the gifts are manifesting themselves oh there are a lot of impersonations that's right we expect that but there's a real too before there can be a bogus dollar there has to be a real one for that to be made off of that's right we have all those carnal comparisons but that don't take away from the real it's only makes the real shine out so the lord is now appearing amongst his people great signs and wonders raising the dead healing the sick and doing the very same things that he did that hasn't been done for 2000 years see see the church is honed up through that brought up till it's right at the time of the headstone is coming to meet the church and then it'll go all together and be raptured the ones fell asleep in the first watch second watch third watch on to the seventh watch the appearing of the lord the last night we touched on that so the challenging part of this my friends and is that in the king james and in the new testament in the bible that you read the second coming of the lord is referred by paul as when the lord appears when he appears in glory we shall be like him so you see it's a little bit of a of a challenge to recognize that all in the old testament bible paul's talking about the appearing of the lord as his second coming is that confusing to you raise your hand if that's a little confusing okay thank you thank you i appreciate you saying that so i just want to take try to be very clear but in the king james bible that word appearing when he shall appear that's his second coming okay now brother branhams takes it just a little different and he says you know he appears by discerning the thoughts and the intents of the heart by raising the dead by opening blind eyes he says that's not the coming of the lord that's just the lord appearing amongst us and doing these signs and wonders because he promised to do these things before the second coming of the lord now as a student of the word of god i recognize that teachers have mixed these things up and they they use these expressions from the new testament and say well you know he's come he's come in some form he's he's you know there's been a there's been another coming that's not one of the three well that's not so there's been him making himself known but it's it's not one of those three comings you see as a as a student of the word of god you nail that down and you say okay the coming of the lord is in a is in a corporal body and this that after the resurrection when the dead in christ shall rise then he shall appear okay and so i don't mean to challenge you but there is a little thing of at the bible study a bible student will see a word as paul used it and paul is always re using that word to refer to as the second coming of the lord but you got to be enough of a student to see that to recognize that's the that's the old english that's the bible terminology when he shall appear but now in our day we talk about the second coming of the lord okay but what the lord jesus did in brother branham's ministry was just to show himself that's an appearing of the lord and that's what brother branham said in the quote and so you say well brother dennis i wish it wasn't so confusing is is it so that the lord allows these things to be perhaps and i'm not a teacher but saints of god it concerns me that it would be put before the people that this rapture is a 50-year process or that when the cloud appeared on sunset mountain that that was the coming of the lord and now we're going to go all this time and it's just going to culminate in the change of our bodies no no brother branham explained what the cloud was and he said that's a vindication of my ministry of the deity of the lord jesus christ it's a sign in the heavens that's not the coming of the lord and and you say well brothers you know why would you have to be so plain because we're living in a day in an hour where of necessity you're going to need to be a student of the word of god so that you're not tossed by every wind of doctrine you know who you are you know what you believe as the son of god i i want to embrace the word of god i i want to receive everything that god has for me but if something's pre presented that contradicts the word of god the coming of the son of man is a future event because the coming of jesus is a future event the rapture is a future event our lord coming back to earth again oh my i can remember that ringing in this tabernacle oh our lord is coming back to earth again let's stand together i trust by the grace of god that this service has been a blessing to you let's sing that song for our lord is coming back to earth again how glorious that will be what a wonderful thing i'm sorry [Music] john the baptist said a man can receive nothing unless it be given to him of god so if a demand is made of me to be something i'm not or to embrace something i can't understand i want to be like john the baptist and he just said i can only be what what god made me i just rejoice at the voice of the bridegroom he that hath the bride he's the bridegroom it's god that gives revelation it's god that gives understanding i just want to stay close enough to him and live a surrendered life that he can talk to me and help me to understand and without that i'm lost i don't have a clue unless he would help me and i'm trusting he will because he promised he would that his spirit would lead me and guide me into all truth let's sing it i've kept you a long time god bless you saints oh our lord is coming back to earth again yes our lord is coming back to earth again satan will be a thousand years we'll have no temper then after jesus shall come back to earth again i am watching for the coming of the glad millennial day when our blessed lord shall come and catch she's waiting right away oh my heart is filled with rapture as i labor watch and pray for our lord is coming back to earth again yes our lord is coming back to earth again yes our lord is coming back to earth again we'll be bound a thousand years we'll have no tempters after jesus shall come back to earth again let's just stop for a moment we'll just have a word of prayer and dismiss you and then we can keep singing and you can go if you need to heavenly father we are trusting you we we trust our hearts to yeah we we're looking to you for understanding lord lord the reason that we want to be solid is we don't want to be compromised lord we want to fight with all the fight that's in us we want to go forward with confidence we don't want anything to shake us from the faith that you've put in our heart lord we just commit this evening's bible study into your hands lord i pray that you'd help us to understand the truth as you'd have us to know it lord we
