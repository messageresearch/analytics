possible amen let's let's just believe i believe he starts out the prayer the people standing and then we can just be seated after the prayer i think god bless remain standing just a moment and bow our heads for word of prayer now as our heads are bowed in our hearts i wonder this being the night that we have set aside now for for the night of salvation for coming to christ and receiving the holy spirit i wonder how many has a requested would like to say this lord god remember me i want to be right with you now would you raise your hand time lord bless you our heavenly father we are so thankful for your presence and for honest hearted people who really believe that that you are coming and they they must make ready for this great event that the whole world has waited for all these thousands of years and we're living just as it was watching time and history run out in eternity beginning to move in and we see this appearing so our hearts are strangely warm and we pray father that you'll search our hearts tonight and tries if there be any sin in us lord take it out we have noticed this week in your great presence as we've watched you over this among this congregation going right down and digging out the very thoughts of the heart and revealing it to us telling us these things now tonight lord we want our hearts to be true and right with you we pray that you'll bless here upon the platform of the pulpit has been placed a box of handkerchiefs little parcels that's going to the needy i pray heavenly father as is their sent from this place where prayer has been made and faith to believe god that that every handkerchief here and every little cloth and parcel that touches the sick may they be healed because this audience and we together are asking in one a card that you will heal him father it's a memorial if we have asked you said ask and you shall receive and when you pray believe that you receive what you ask for i believe lord we all believe and it's being asked now let it be done for the kingdom of god sake for we asked it in jesus name amen well it's certainly good to be back at the at the auditorium again tonight and under great expectations for the lord to visit us tonight as we've set this night aside from praying for the sick to the to seeking salvation for our souls each one of us needs to rededicate our lives anew and this week we have seen the presence of jesus christ the vindicated scripture him right here among us watching what he did the same things that he did on earth when he was here before he doing it just the same have we seen the ministry as is climbing just like we're growing into a perfect day uh perfect church we started out just like like we were saying this morning in our lovely little fellowship this morning we certainly had a wonderful time at that breakfast i think the brethren or their fine cooperation i got to shake the hands of many of them these fine man that's sponsoring this meeting uh bringing us in here it shows that they're interested in their people they're shepherds and interested in their sheep and so i'm grateful that some of these uh any shepherd is interested in getting his sheep uh with vitamins and these are spiritual vitamins as it was it helps the sheep to grow into strong faith in our god and so i appreciate such man and now speaking this morning on the thought of the church growing see coming like a seed in the ground and that seed as its planting grows from glory unto glory and it becomes after a while into a blossom and then goes back to the seed that's like the original seed that was planted and so has the church been the church age started in this last days after the dark ages it started with martin luther in the reformation preaching justification by faith after his time and they organized the church it died out and then there comes swingly after luther and swingley didn't even believe in the virgin birth he went over into switzerland they still don't believe and the swingly doctrine do not believe that jesus was virgin born they said he was the son of joseph call the son of god but that takes the whole prop out from under uh the whole foundation of christianity he was virgin born or he's just a man like you or i he was the son of god and then after that come calvin and on and on finally the church got in such a condition there kind of had to have another reformation and god sent john wesley with a message of sanctification cleansiness of the spirit and then he and whitfield and many of them went on in the great reformation and asbury they come to the united states and that great revival saved england and the world at that time what did they do after them founders died out they began to organize upon their doctrine and the first thing you know they made an organization then we had others break off mayor such as alexander campbell john smith from the baptist church and so forth and then the nazarene pilgrim holiness and others come on and then come the great reformation again pentecost coming out of those organizations with the restoration of the gifts speaking in tongues divine healing great miracles and signs come off that went for a long time it's been 50 about 58 years now since the holy spirit began to fall on old azusa street out in california you're in the united states where it started falling the great time come then what did pentecost do one made him an organization one said he's coming on a white horse another no white cloud and the way they went the organizations split up breaking up the brotherhood among the people and just like israel little did israel know that when they were shouting the victory on the bank of the river they were only about four days journey about 40 miles away from the promised land they didn't realize they were 40 years it would take them but what was it grace had provided them a profit a pillar of fire a sacrifice lamb a deliverance and still they wanted a law they wanted something they could have something to do into they want to put their hands to it that's the most rational mistake they ever made and exodus 19 when israel rejected grace and accepted law and then what did they do he just let them stay right there in the wilderness for 40 years they plant vineyards and they eat fruit and they married wives they raised children until that old generation died off and another generation come on 40 years later and not hardly 40 hours away but had to wait for 40 years before they went over and then a new leader came in joshua and they moved on into the land with the new group now i think it's a very beautiful type here that we find out long ago when our forefathers in the pentecost they raised up they had the old general counsel from that form of the assemblies of god out of that come the ubc and then united and so forth till they got the organization after organizations fussing and fighting god just let them sit right there merry wives raise children speak in tongues shout the spirit but now there's a new group come up they were only just a few days from the promised land all these blessings ahead was fine but you remember the whole land belonged to them now we're fixing to go into the promised land so may the lord help us as we look upon these things just like the pyramid did you notice how the pyramid was made not a pyramid doctrine now just a pyramid look on your one dollar bill the seal of the united states is that eagle well why does it stay over there on the pier made the great seal why would it be greater here in the united states and and the seal of the united states the great seal the eye watching and the the capstone that goes upon the pyramid was it was rejected it never was on the pyramid isn't to this day the stone was scrolling late plain but it never was put on the capstone why when enoch and them in the early days built the pyramids down in egypt we find out and in there they knew that the cornerstone the capstone would be rejected and that pair made his puzzle perfectly together too they don't need martyr it was so mechanically hewed out until one stone fits against the other so tight you can't even put a razor blade between them now it's kept weeping up and now it's all honed off on top ready for the capstone when it will come that's the way god's brought his church from justification sanctification baptism the holy spirit and now the ministry of the spirit which is the what quickens the word that ministry in the church will have to be just exactly like this just like this when my shadow here of my hand if i never see my hand seen the shadow it's kind of it gets pale as it gets away but it gets closer and closer the negative and positive are coming together until they both become the same thing and that's exactly when the church and the word has to be one like jesus and god was one just exactly the god has was in christ reconciling the world to himself and so will christ have to be in the church the anointed of the word to make everything fulfilled and that's a capstone that comes up on the last church age not the lady ocean now it's a calling out of that a bride out of a church church out of a church in other words it's like he called a nation out of a nation in egypt and now we're living in that day and we're grateful for these great things that we've been seeing now tomorrow afternoon the lord willing is going to be the closing of this service this part of the service and uh we're going to designate that all together for praying for the sick and everybody that wants to be prayed for may come out and get a prayer card to come through the prayer line now the reason we get prayer cards on these is keep them lined up and then if you don't then just keep passing around around around and see you there so you we give them a prayer card you have a prayer card you come in the line and you'll see and believe you'll see the glory of god take place it'll be great and now we thank you for all that you have done and for the great welcome that we've had amongst these ministry brothers and so forth now tomorrow is sunday and these churches will be open there'll be no service here tomorrow morning it'd be sunday school and you visitors i've got some friends in here myself at uh it's with us in a party and some has come down from my home town here to be with us now these are the man that sponsors this meeting they believe this type of meeting if i lived here in this city i'd belong to one of their churches i certainly would because they believe the same thing that i believe and i belong to one of their churches if i lived here and you gave your life to christ this week and you don't have a church home why don't you talk it over with them they believe this same thing or they wouldn't be sitting up here represented see so now you you you find your nice one of these nice churches tomorrow and go to it and i'm sure they'll do you good they'll help you they'll help you to believe and if you haven't been baptized ask them if you haven't received the holy ghost ask them about it and they'll help you right on through to christ and shepherd you right on down the road until he returns now the lord bless each one of you and now you know the presbyterians are always raising up and setting down they say and i'm not a presbyterian but i do believe that when we read the word we ought to stand because it's an honor to god to stand is like we salute the flag or pledge allegiance or what more and now for tonight i have chosen some scripture reading here out of the book of saint luke the seventh chapter beginning with the 36th verse and now all week long i've been working on a thought that come to me on the road coming down here on the unveiling of the mighty god but when i got through looking at my scriptures and things i had nearly 20 pages so i never get through that no hour here so i thought i'd have to change it tonight so i have i believe it's will of the lord and i say these things now in seventh chapter of saint luke and the 36th verse one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the pharisees house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that jesus sat at meat in the pharisees house brought an ambassador box of ointment and stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment now when the pharisee which had been him saw it he spake within himself remember not out loud but then himself saying if this man was a prophet he would know who and what manner of woman this is that touched him for she is a sinner jesus answered and said unto him simon i have somewhat to say unto thee and he said master say on there was a certain creditor which had two debtors and they owed one owed 500 pence and the other 50 and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him most simon answered and said i suppose that he to whom he forgave the most and he said unto him thou as rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto simon seest thou this woman i entered into thy house thou gives me no water for my feet but she has washed my feet with tears and has wiped them with the hairs of her head and thou giveth me no kiss but this woman since the time i came in has not ceased to kiss my feet my head with all thou didst not anoint but this woman has anointed my feet with aura wherefore i say unto her say unto thee her sins which were many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven the same loveth little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven and they that set at me with him begin to say within themselves who is this that forgive us sins also and he said to the woman thy faith is say thee go in peace let us pray lord jesus this story has taken place many years ago but it's a true story for it is written in the pages of our bible and we know that it's true and now we would by no means try to portray this again tonight but we would like for you to help us to bring this as a message tonight to the people that they might see that that you're still the same lord jesus and we pray for your blessings upon us all as we are needy people we have need of thee lord and we believe tonight though we see you make the blind the sea and the death to here and the lame to walk and by doctor's statements have seen you raise up five people from the dead in different times different nations but yet lord i believe the most sickest thing i know of tonight is the body of christ here on earth the church it's really safe heal it tonight lord this potion that sets your together this this bunch of soul journey here in in tampa this lovely bunch of people lord heal every womb tonight let the spirit grant this to us for we asked it in jesus name and for his honor for his glory here in this city or we are a journey amen let me see i should call it now just for a few moments and um try not each night i have to apologize to you because it you've been so nice and i you're such an easy audience to preach to uh you just don't know when to stop and that makes the minister know that you're feeding or receiving the words that i'm seeing and i'll come to you on a bit i'm the tardis i've ever been and i don't know when see i haven't let up since christmas i'm going right from here to tucson to start again come right from there to go to british columbia to baptize a whole tribe of indians that are led to christ were formerly catholic last fall was on a hunting trip and the whole group gave their heart to christ by the healing of the mother one of the mothers that the doctors no one could touch her she's laying dying and they want me to come back as soon as the ice gets melted so it gets 85 below zero there and so and i smell it i'm taking them and all a great bunch of trappers and hunters up down alaska and highway are all meeting with me to be baptized and accepting christ they seen the lord show a vision of a certain thing where a certain bear would be how much he'd weigh what kind he was and where a certain animal would be staying who would be there and what to be wearing and all about it and told him before it happened and they said it's not even that kind of things in this country and we went right straight to it and happened word by word the trophies hangs in my room today they said we want to be baptized too rough man but you know he's got seed laying everywhere my subject tonight is jesus keeps all his appointments i want you to bear that old mind as we speak and i i won't talk too long and i want you to think it over now that remember you've got to meet this one that's present with us tonight someday now it must have been almost sundown when our sitting starts out tonight it must have been about sundown and this courier had run all day maybe two or three days he was trying to find him he went down maybe almost from dan to besheba because jesus in his ministry was going to speak here perform his signs and wonders and the people are all together he would take off somewhere else i must go to another city and it had a hard time perhaps it went over to capernaum and they said well he left you a week ago we don't know exactly where he went but he went somewhere else and he oh he was tired his hair was wet was perspiration his legs were dusty and sweaty and as he come up into the party where jesus had been speaking and jesus also was tired he'd been speaking all day his mouth was dry from much speaking and his hands begin to look trembling and his eyes weary as the sun began to sink and he wanted to see jesus he had a message for him and now jesus had 12 men around him that kept the people away from him uh of course he just coming up on him and so the i'm making this in a drama so that everybody can catch it and so we find that in this jesus man he must have come let's say he come to philip and philip might have said something like this uh uh sir or young fella we would certainly like to let you see the master but but he's so tired we just got to watch him because he he just goes to the almost drops and we've been in so many meetings and so forth lately to uh i'm sorry i don't believe we can do it but he says i i have a note here that comes from a very important man in religious realms and it's an invitation for your master which will be a great great thing if if he shall go and i'm a scene because i've been commissioned that i must take this note to him and see that he gets it personally so finally if they tuck him up to the lord jesus and while he was looking at him the lord jesus perhaps leaving his place pulpit from where he was speaking were the disciples and them and fixed for him to talk from as he was looking why he looked upon the young man he must have liked him and the young man told him he said i am on a errand sir and there's a very high ranking man down in a certain city and he's a pharisee the strictest of the religions and he's uh he's making a dinner a great time of banquet and he wants you to come to be the guest of honor and he's uh manny would like to attend this banquet but he has selected you and i've been three days trying to find you across the country and i was certainly happy to get your sir i'll deliver this note to you from it and from him and he took the note and read it and he find out that this certain pharisee had was making a feast and and had bid him to come down and be a guest of honor with him so jesus standing for a few moments and looking at the young man and yet as busy as he was but you can never invite him but what he'll come i don't care what the situation is he'll come he uh said you tell your your master that i'll be there on this certain day at this certain time i'll be there and the courier must smile satisfied and turned away and run off down the hill to take the good news back to his master that he had succeeded in getting the message to this one that he wanted what was the matter with that courier how could it be was he conscious of what he done the first time maybe in his life that he ever stood in the presence of jesus and never even asked forgiveness of his sins he never he never took the opportunity oh how it's the same way with people today many times they they're realize that they're in his presence and never ask forgiveness well that he maybe never presented the opportunity another time and turned down his last opportunity to ask forgiveness how could he ever have done that how could this boy ever so been wrapped up and bringing this message from his master that he failed in the presence of the son of god that asked forgiveness it was all a business affair and you know that's something like the people today church christ has become a a business affair or or social affair to join church and get just a a a little better social standing for your business or something to stand out a little better in the neighborhood it is the thing of of really coming and repenting like a sinner should do many times in church people are brought right in the presence of christ and turn away and do as rational thing as this courier uh did oh you should have fell upon his knees when he first realized that it was who he was and he's saying master i have a message for you but first i want you to forgive me that would have been the right approach and then if there's any business to be done let that be done later but to first get his own soul right with god that's why i think so much healing becomes a failure or professed healing because the first place the people are not ready for healing they won't confess their wrongs the bible said confess your faults one to another and pray one for the other and we're not willing to do that if we can take the healing and go ahead and go on back and do what we was doing they would accept that but when it comes to really first coming and getting right with god people don't want to do that and that's the reason it throws a a bad a damper over divine healing you see so many people that walk in like it walk out and don't and god knows all about those things now this fellow made a real rational thing we would think we would think if i could only take his place if i could go up before his throne and take a message the first thing i would do what would you do be interested in what your organization has sent you up there to find out about or would you be looking around and see how heaven was decorated or in his presence with the first thing you say lord god forgive me a sinner that would be the right thing to do now as jesus watched the boy and as he went away might come in his mind why didn't that boy do that was because he wasn't conscious who that was may i say this not sacrilegious may i say this not because it's this meeting or any meeting but i think that's what's the matter today people are not conscious of it amen they see the scripture exactly identified but they're not conscious of who it is they'll see something and they say oh that was wonderful that was fine but you're not conscious of what it is if it was there to be a repentance going on weeping and crying the city would have such a revival to half of you be locked up before morning it's right if we be conscious of what it is and we pass by many times and missed the opportunity but not being conscious i don't think the boy really realized he'd been raised up among this pharisee which was a a a great ruler a prince or a religious man and he'd been raised up with him and and and just took his side of religion and the pharisees laughed at jesus and made fun of him or something that he did as they in that day and that he just thought it off that wasn't enough but it's an ordinary message he had to deliver he just sat there and he's in his presence and that was all it was to him it didn't mean nothing to him but if he'd been conscious that boy could rise up from the dead today and set in this meeting this week he'd have done something about it he'd have a testimony that would have shook us all but he wasn't conscious now in the scene here there's something wrong it is it isn't as jesus watched that boy go away tired and weary but the whole setting there's something wrong them pharisees hated jesus why would they invite him for a guest of honor when they hated him that pharisee had a as the old gambler's expression he had us some of his sleeve he had a trick card in his sleep because they hated jesus i believe jesus realized that right then see people must have things in common my mother she used to have an expression birds of a feather flock together you don't see you don't see buzzards and doves feeding together there there one's a scavenger and the dove couldn't eat the buzzard's food because he don't have any gold he couldn't digest it and you don't see believers and unbelievers together unless there's some kind of a purpose bar there's something something wrong this guy had a trick up his sleeve you want to play it on jesus how you take people like you take young people young teenage children they don't like to be around the old folks because they they have things in common the young married couples they have things in common the old people they don't want to be around the kids so much they they got things in common when you see a little girl hanging with grandma all the time now there's there's something wrong there's too much difference in their age she's either grandma's pet or grandma's got a sack of candy somewhere see there's a trick somewhere i got a grandchild myself and i know there's a little trick somewhere seen and you see her hanging around grandma grandma's got a uh sack of candy or something so this pharisee had something up his sleeve it all happened at a ministerial meeting where they gathered together and the subject was discussed about this fellow who called himself a prophet and they didn't believe he was a prophet because they couldn't see a man that wouldn't go along with them and all their doctrine that could be a prophet and so in this ministerial meeting they had decided that he wasn't a prophet and this old pharisee was going to prove it to him that he wasn't a prophet the pharisee was going to to make it sure and to show the congregation all the people in that city that he wasn't a prophet before he ever visit the city he'd never been in that city before so before he come he's going to expose him all that spirit it still lives going to expose it do something to hinder the meaning that he would have had there so we find out that he said i'll make a dinner and i'll invite everybody and get everybody in the city around and then we'll prove that he's not no prophet we'll prove it so pharisee might have thought that if he were doing this he would uh he would uh got a little uh maybe become after a while one of the presbyters or something he'd it really made a hit with his group he was going to make fun at the banquet of the lord jesus to prove that he was the prophet do put him on the spot somewhere then he would be a big fellow among them become some great man now we find out that the courier returns back and tells his master i found him he promised and he'll be here because i just tell the way he acted he'll be here all right now the pharisee waited for this certain time and they know when to make this banquet when everything was just right perhaps you will think in our little drama tonight that that he made it in a time when the grapes was ripe if he was ever in palestine when a great time or even in california when i'm great big clusters of grapes are just bleeding right the whole uh country the valley is just full of that sweet smelling odor from those grapes he knows just when to make it right so he set that time on a certain day they would have this feast and finally the time come with when the feast was going to be carried on and he invited everybody to come that he could to come up all the celebrity and all the associations and so forth and all the clubs that was in the city that he belonged to it was all coming out to his great fine palace that set out high stood out as an estate there in the city and the time arrived for this to be done of course the yard was all taken care of and the tables were all set and the banquet room ready and then now he's going to have to take care of the his guests when they come any host will do that so he had to hire some stable boys because some of his hosts would be or some of his guests would be coming on uh chariots and some riding on mules some walking so anyone that makes a uh has a banquet has to make ready to entertain their guests so pharisee got everything just fixed up in all of his servants and got them ready got the stable boys where they could take the horses and all the fodder and stuff ready for him and then you had an innkeeper or door keeper that had to take up the invitations cause you you could not come unless she was invited and to take up the invitations he had their names down ever who was going to be there and they come they identified their name and so they could come in then let's just look what what they had to do for a while i've been in the orients and maybe many of your has and watch how they do it it's it's really striking and you notice then when everything's taken care of then when they come in the door the first thing the the keeper the door as to the r and they tell who they are he looks on his list and here's the name then he checks it then what he does he takes his staff sets it in the corner the boys takes the horses if he's walking or if he's on the horse and puts it in the stable now the next thing he does he enters into a hall and in here there's a bunch of a man what's called the feet washers the flunkies it's the lowest paid job there is is the foot wash flunky and to think of it we who think we're somebody and our lord identified himself on earth as a foot wash flunky so exactly what he did and then we think we're somebody we'll run off here to school and get a little education in it and learn to say a few big words and come back and put on a suit of clothes and walk out here and want to be called dr reverend or somebody i was up at a big museum not long ago and looking at some of the estimation of a man weighed a 150 pound how much chemicals there was in his body you know how much there is when he's all rendered up is worth 84 cents then you'll put a ten dollar hat on at 84 cents and a 500 mink coat and turn your nose up if it rained it would drown you and then go along taking care of that 84 cents right thinking you're somebody and you don't give a care you act like it about that soul it's worth 10 million worlds the difference the rational how we can get now this foot wash flunky he had to wash their feet now in the when you travel in palestine the palestinian garment is a robe it hangs low and then the underneath garment this comes to about the calf of the leg here for the underneath garment and as the the animals and the man travel the same trail the animals of course going along the trail and and um and as as they travel the same trail and and the dust would come up from where the animals had been and it was a stink in the dust and it got on their feet when they were perspiring and their feet was shot with sandals and that would get all full of perspiration and and be wet sticky and then this stink from where the animals across the trail would the palestinian garments sweeping like a skirt down low would pick up this dust and it would get beneath here and get all over their feet and over their their limbs and they really smell like that trail where the animals have been so coming into a home like those pharisees had they're sent into persian got those great big fine rugs and and everything why you wouldn't feel welcome to come in before the host and uh and and then be all stinky like that so they had a way of taking care of that they had a foot wash flunky and he stayed there and as soon as you come in and your name was registered the boys taking the horses or your animals and taking them back to feed them one group of boys and then the door keeper recognized you by the chart that he had in his hand and then you're ready for the foot wash flunky then you go in you set your foot up he pulls off the sandal sets it up to a place so he'll know where you're at and on this other side he has a little shoe and actually gets through washing your feet washing it all off real good all the dust and everything make you fresh then he puts on this little cloth uh a shoe that goes over like you see in airplanes and crossing over overseas now they give them to you at night when you like uh the women have those little things they wear when they're not wearing stockings i see my wife and daughter and him getting some time they it's a little i like i don't know what they call them but it's just like a bottom part of a sock you know and and you put it on your foot there's something on that order it's a little higher because you don't want to take your old dirty sandal and walk over them rugs in there so then your feet's washed then you got the next thing takes place you got this little booty on i'll call it and then the next thing takes place there's a man standing there with a towel over his shoulder and he's got some ointment in his hands and that's a perfumed oil now the direct rays of that palestinian sun upon your neck is just blistering and another thing that dustin picks up sometimes get into their beard and in their hair and this man stands here then with ointment and he holds it out in this little pan you get on your hands and rub it in your face and over your neck then you take this towel and wipe it off groom your hair now sometimes this is very rare because it really gives a wonderful odor they get it many times from way high in the mountains on a wild rose bush you've seen the rules at the pedal drops off and it gets a little a little apple-like on it and out of there they crush it and get this perfume it's said that the queen of sheba when she come to solomon brought much of this fine perfume of that and give it to solomon very rare so hard to get into the mountains and then when they wipe this their beard and cross their necks and with this towel groom themselves now they're ready to meet the hoax to meet the one that invited them see they wouldn't feel right to go with all that dirt that's why feet washing see they they were smelling bad and they had to have their feet washed and with their big old heavy sandals on them fine rugs they wouldn't feel right to feel embarrassed but now his feet's washed now he's all groomed he smells with the perfume that's on him from this ointment what they call anointing their heads with oil and rubbed it on their face then wiped it with a towel now he's freshed up now the next thing he does he meets his horse the one that invited him he feels like meeting him now he wouldn't feel like meeting with all that dirt on him so he's all groomed up and ready now then the host meets him at the door and they have a very odd way and uh it's still uh in some of the churches a greeting with a kiss so they take a hand cross this way embrace one another man with with their arms around each other like this and kiss each other on the neck and when the horse kisses you you are welcome that's the welcome kiss now you wouldn't want your horse to kiss you with all that old dirt and stuff on on you so you had to be cleaned up before you're kissed welcome but oh one once you're kissed welcome you are a full-fledged brother that's all you could today the only thing you can do like today you're going a house and you feel at home you're one of them he's kissed you welcome you remember judas kissing jesus hypocritically see because if he kissed him it was a welcome it was a friend kiss not in the lips but on the neck kissed him on the neck now we noticed saying that you could go in if you want to go to the refrigerator it would be today and get you a great big sandwich and lay across the bed and eat it just make yourself at home you're welcome come in that's your all right now you just feel one of the family now because you're on the inside now you get all this done and anointed and uh all fixed up you're kissed welcome and then you go in shake hands at the banquet you meet your friends the host of done kissed you in and so you're you're free now you just feel like you're one of them you've been invited you've been clean you've been kissed welcome and now you're what i'm going to have your fellowship now about this time i'd imagine that rose lamb out there and the barbecue pit in the back was just smelling all around over the country with them grapes and things you'd imagine the poor people standing around the fence their mouth water they wasn't invited in just the celebrity to this so the the feast was now getting in pretty good sway everything is getting along fine for good sway now i'd imagine pharisee and his all of his friends is tipping the glass one to another and taking a good healthy drink of the very best wines there was in palestine at the time because they were rich they could afford it and they everybody the women they're fine jeweled women was over in a corner having their fellowship sitting around on the vans and so forth as a custom was in that day and the man all up having their toast and talking and the priests and all the rabbis everything having a great time and the the feast is getting pretty well uh on the way and then jesus although busy as he was in his busy schedule he always keeps his appointment you can depend on that he keeps his appointment now let's look into the room and see what's going on i can see pharisee over there tipping his glass and saying rabbi you know what and the great conversation going on the businessman talking of their business and everything the bank and some banquets in full swing now this great feast look sitting over against the wall not being noticed because jesus he kept his appointment he come he always keeps his word all his promises he fulfills but lord see he's sitting over there dirty i hate to say that it kills me to say it but his feet was dirty he had been anointed he hadn't been kissed welcome though he was invited that's like some of our modern revivals the frenchman calls him jesus jesus with dirty feet could you imagine it he was invited and he come and there he is it got in some way and unnoticed he sets over as a wall flower he was just as much out of place there he is in some of our modern revivals banquets so-called religious gatherings he was out of place nobody is paying any attention to me they were too busy with other things although he was invited but he wasn't welcome when he come what happened to that foot wash flunky how did he ever miss that opportunity yeah i wish i would have had his opportunity oh my god if i knew he'd been coming out i've been standing there waiting for him i'd have been ready for it how did he do it now let's not condemn him too much because we might do the same thing and not know it he missed him oh my notice he comes today to our callings too he comes in our midst i don't want to say this but i must say it and in our midst he's understood among us sitting there just as dirty to the people as he was saying it's exactly right call them holy rollers and everything else and yet we cry for a revival and he comes and when he does come we treat him about like they did then somebody raised up in the spirit of god holler a man or scream or something like that when jesus happens to pass by why the they put out a church well they think that's an awful shame to disgrace the church disgrace to people when it's jesus himself passing by and we can see him come and identify his word and do just like he did then and today they sense fortune telling mental telepathy or some evil spirit before the people is just as dirty as he was sitting there jesus the word of god and we do nothing about it we're too interested in our organization or our our social standing we're ashamed to be called by his name we're actually ashamed of him they was ashamed of him because he was dirty the guests didn't know him and they was ashamed of him because he's dirty that's the way it is today they're still ashamed of him because they pile the dirt that they can upon call it holy rollers and everything else that they can think of nobody does nothing about it there he says dirty feet wallflower at the party wallflower in a religious meeting invited we asked him to come for revival when he comes we treat him the same way they did there he come and identify himself but nobody wants nothing to do with him if he can pull some kind of a gimmick or or or do some kind of a miracle like he did before pilate pilot his only opportunity he ever had and he asked he'd want to see something done i wonder if let's see some sign he ought to repent that's what this cruel hell-bound world ought to do tonight's repent of their sins that's what these church members ought to do repent of their unbelief stand up for him he's the same yesterday today and forever and he identifies himself just like he did then and the people today take the same attitude that pharisee took same kind of an attitude let him settle after inviting him yet they don't want him they just do it like for manners he knows it we done to him today just like they did then instead of washing him washing his the reproach away instead of trying to stand up saying you're mistaken it's the word of god made manifest it's what he promised he said he poured out the spirit in the last days we're living in the last days instead of that we just kind of set back like they did we're afraid to take a stand why the i'm gonna raise up and say that's jesus of nazareth i believe he's a prophet of god you know the reason they didn't do it because they didn't believe he was a prophet and they still don't today they think he's an educator they think he's a denomination they don't know he's still a prophet that's what they're heading down there for in question that's the same thing as in question about today nobody's ready to take up for him they just say well you got nothing to do with him i belong to church there's my pastors all of them sitting around here i'm a good person and jesus with dirty feet nobody cared the very bible now we walk up and shake hands put our name on the book the methodist and they don't want us we're taking towards the baptist they kick this out we go to nazarenes the one that's kicked us out we go up to two and this the two of us kick us out we go to threeinus we don't have to put up with none of it all starchy that's it's the same way we and when jesus comes amen we don't even recognize we don't care that's right that's the way they do and yet we're crying come lord jesus come lord jesus and he comes and what do we do same thing they did why if they say anything except it somebody else will here make fun of them and they let him set dirty it's called an evil spirit you remember jesus told him one day when they said this man does this by beelzebub he said you say that against me to be forgiven but someday the holy ghost will come to do the same thing and one word against it will never be forgiven there we are jesus with dirty feet could you imagine it could you imagine people who claim to love god and it got so mixed up in their creeds and their denominations and isms jesus said your traditions you've made the word of god of no effect there he was there and the word was in effect because it was made flesh and was proven exactly that he was the christ and the people with their traditions wouldn't let it be effective upon the other people that's what he was doing trying to show it off if see they didn't believe he was a prophet and yet the bible said he would be a prophet the bible moses said the lord your god shall raise up a prophecy around the 18 15. and the bible predicted just exactly what he was doing here he come doing it among those people and today we leave him with just his dirty name as he had then let him say things against it in the days of miracles just pastors though such a thing when the bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever and we're still ashamed to stand out and say something about it we're ashamed of our testimony that we we claim we believe instead of washing him trying to wash him with tears of joy that he's here we just let him sit dirty i won't have not do it i cooperate nothing like that put my hand on it there you are it's the same bunch of pharisees just under another knee we again let him set like that for the same reason we don't believe he's a prophet we're ashamed of it why the same reason we don't believe it the people don't know sir he can come do whatever he wishes to they're setting their ways and there's nobody trying to fool with him and you know the bible said they'd be that way exactly the bible said they'd be that way lukewarm form of godliness to have no power thereof think that's right we join up with this educational polished up group standing there and having our big socials and times our fine churches and find decorations then jesus christ can come in and you let him stay dirty the word can be made manifest among us and we still walk around let people talk about it oh my god you know we we would look and say that's them that's other churches but let's look at ourselves he's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and he keeps all his appointments when we come and we've set up a time aside on a wednesday night on a sunday morning sunday evening there at your home you make an invitation he comes and if you'll recognize him you'll say lord i have need of you he'll say then what what what do you have need of so if we'll stand and i just just get to
