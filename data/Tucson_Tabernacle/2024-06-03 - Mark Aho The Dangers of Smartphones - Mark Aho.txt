TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] El [Music] for [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] let's let's all stand for a minute and we can open in prayer our heavenly father Lord we count on an honor when we can come together whether it be to worship on Sunday morning or whether it be something like this where we come here to understand Lord the world a little bit more that is the Lord Jesus commanded us to be wise as serpents but harmless as doves and father we pray that today that we could learn something that would help us through this life that father that we would be able to keep an eye out always for the enemy because we know know that he's always there lurking and trying to get his way with us father we pray that your blessings would be upon each person upon the speaker as he talks to us about these perils that that face us every day and Lord most of all that you would be glorified in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you can be seated this um this presentation brother Josiah sent it to me uh a couple weeks ago and uh his dad brother Mark gives um gives a really nice testimony of the perils that face us every day in on the internet and on um these devices that we have whether it be a computer or whether it be a um a smartphone or or a tablet and I would just like to share as as we get started I would just like to share a couple test testimonies this happened actually brother Josiah told it to me today he's selling a vehicle and he gets a call on this vehicle and when did it happen yes where did you say yesterday what happened this morning and it's it's amazing I believe this is fortuitous that we're here and we're going to be talking about what just happened to Josiah so this person texts him and says I'm here they said they were interested in the car and like maybe asked one question and then said uh send a code to know that you're legit and you're not a scammer so they're trying to say so we know that you're real and then uh so a code pops up and it was a Google verification code that ex specifically said don't share this code with anyone and so I said uh I am real I'm not sending you a code and then so this guy freaks out and starts cussing me out over text and saying you're a scammer you must be a scammer because you won't send me the code you won't help out you won't and but if I would have sent him the code he could have logged into my email and not only his email but if he has his Google code there's many different ways that you can you can extort someone and um I I have gotten emails before and I got an email uh I don't know about five years ago and uh it the subject line was my password that I used for most things and I looked at it and I was like whoa what is what is that that's my password and I clicked on it and the email said we have have video of you evidence of you looking at nasty websites and send us it was like $831 and we won't share this information but if you don't we are going to share this information through social media so I sent it immediately forwarded it to our it department and I said what in the world is this and um they did some research and what had happened was there's a website called LinkedIn brother Jordan I'm sure you're familiar with LinkedIn probably brother Michael it's a it's a very popular um like a professional um for lack of a better word social media that you can just you can share information and job applications and that well what happened is they had a data link leak and my information was on that data leak and they use that information to um send out these threatening emails and try to get money and you can imagine if the person was guilty of doing that they wouldn't want their inform this all this stuff spread out on the web so they would immediately fall for this and pay the money it was a way to extort money and we all know and you've seen my messages on Whatsapp over the past couple months a couple at least twice this church has been hit with potential scams one of them was an email that looked like it came from pastor at Tucson Tabernacle and it went to a number of you one of the people that it went to was Sister Angela baggot and it was it looked like it was for me it said hey Angela um I need you to get some gift cards for me and we were having a an event later on so sister Angela immediately she's she gets ready and she's going to the store to get some of these gift cards for me and the instructions were were very plain I need four $50 gift cards or something like that and I need the number off of those and it looked just like it was me in fact there was a picture of me on the um on the email did anyone here get it you got it sister Debbie you got it there was a picture of me right on there and it was me ministering and so sister Angela immediately she gets ready and she's going to go to the store and get me these gift cards well brother Jeremy he text me and he's like hey what's basically what's the deal with this and I said uh I didn't do that nor would I ever do that and it was a scam and a number of people got this and then another one came there was another scam another a sister in this church there was a number of emails that went out through her did you all get that one from there was I think a lot of us got got this one but I didn't but another um I think it was WhatsApp no it was a Facebook Messenger went out from the sister asking for information and saying that there was this good deal on something to make money and and sent out to a number of the sisters in the church and someone called me who was it sister Amelia sister Amelia called me and she said brother Daniel I got this um email uh or I got this what this uh Facebook Messenger from this sister in the church she said and it says that we our social security we can get more money if we if we fill out this application I said no sister let me call her so I called the sister she said no she says a couple other people have asked me so what it was was it was another way to get your personal information so that they can go up and open up a credit card in your name or they can extort some money from you they're out there and these things are evil and they are getting very very good at what they do so when I saw this when brother Josiah sent me this information I said you know what this would be good for the church to hear and like I said you know what let's just read it brother brandom said that no service is complete without reading the word let me read a couple scriptures here um first brother Jordan if you turn to Matthew chapter 10: 16 now Jesus was sending out his disciples to go out and spread the gospel and it says this behold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves that's what we are today we're good people in a very evil World behold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves what does it mean to be wise as a serpent you need to know that serpent tactics and then Proverbs 22:3 I got this for from uh brother Mark Proverbs 22:3 says this a prudent man foresee the evil and hideth himself but the simple pass on and are punished excellent scripture to lead in to you brother Mark brother Josiah if you would lead us could you lead us in a song before Clean Heart oh God and right Spirit Within Me create in me create in me a clean heart oh God and reew right Spirit within cast me not away cast me not away from thy presence oh Lord take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me restore unto me the joy of th Sal and [Music] right Amen brother Mark if you could come and uh if I could just give a little bit advice never give away your personal information never give away like brother Josiah dealt with a code if never give away that personal code that might come to you via email or text never give away your social security number never give away any information to anyone that calls let me tell One More Story and you'll like this this one will lead well into you into yours um I used to work with uh Brother Sam borders does does anybody know remember brother Roy borders and brother brandom talking about brother borders he was his campaign manager uh for years well Brother Sam he stayed in the ministry and I worked with him in Jeffersonville um I'll tell two stories sorry no no you can stay here so I'll tell the first one so his mom I'll tell both of them his mom sister uh sister borders um she was she called him up and uh she said Sam she says there's somebody following me and Sam says mom where are you she says well and and I'm listening to Sam on the phone and uh he says she says well she says I got into my house and um and there's somebody following me and Sam says Mom did you lock the door and she says yeah she says but I I don't know what to do and he says well what kind of what kind of car is he driving and she says I don't know and he says mom well like what does he look like she says I don't know and he says mom well who's following you she says I don't know I don't I I never heard of his name before and he and she said he says mom if you don't if you can't if you haven't seen him and you don't know what kind of car he's driving driving he says how do you know somebody's following you she says I got a I got a text on my phone said that this person is following me now it's Facebook just following her on Facebook same person this one is not so funny sister Helen got a uh phone call from her son um her other son Stephen and he says mom I need some money and it wasn't like Stephen she says she says okay what uh what's wrong he says Mom I just I just need some money and he says okay and um it was a phone number that she didn't recognize and he says mom if you could just if you could just Apple pay me the money and I think it was to that phone number I don't remember exactly the details and she said says o okay okay well um what do you need it for and and he says Mom I just I just need the money and she ended up calling Sam her other son and she said Sam she said Stephen just call me and he he needs money and he's like Mom that doesn't sound like Stephen so he says call Stephen back she called him back on his phone and he says no Mom that wasn't me do you know those voice recognition software it sounded ex exactly like her son Stephen and it was someone trying to get money out of her and I think that leads in perfectly do I need this or uh the other's fine okay yeah and that the technology is so good that they need three seconds of your voice if they've got three seconds of your voice they can do a realistic fake of your voice that's how good it's getting so well God bless you for coming the last time I gave this was in Santiago Chile in a week or a year ago in February and uh those young people were so pumped to be there it was their first Camp after the shutdown there's over 500 young people from every uh country except Brazil in South America so so they didn't want to give anything up so they had this really packed agenda and if an event ran over they would just start the next event later so by the time I got to my presentation it was after midnight and they had done soccer they' done skits they' done games they had done all this stuff all day and I just felt bad these poor young people and nobody moved and nobody blinked and nobody fell asleep they're right with me the whole time so I was pretty impressed so if you ever get a chance to meet those young people in Chile you know in South America they're great you'd really love them and we've got some older young people here tonight too so there's two kinds of young people you know there's young young people there's older young people so we've got both here tonight but thanks for coming especially on a Monday and this topic we're in is sometimes scary to people it's a topic that makes people nervous because they use all these products that are out there and they're afraid somebody's going to tell them they got to quit doing what they're doing but what I've got here is information based and I've learned over almost 10 years of working with this topic if you just get the information to the people so they understand what's going on the Holy Ghost can teach them how to deal with it so I'm not here to do the Holy Ghost job and tell you how to deal with your device and your internet and your usage and all of that I'm here to get you the information as best as I can and the Holy Ghost will help you because it is a treacherous age we live in many dangers very very tricky and getting trickier that is a beautiful guitar I had one kind of like that in college and I sold it and I didn't know what I sold and it took me years and years to find another ianz hollow body like the one I had in college and it's not exactly like but it was pretty close isn't that pretty has anyone ever seen a guitar like that before an ianz semih hollow body with the kind of tiger stripes on the wood and all that they're pretty rare they're kind of hard to find but I finally found one and so that's a picture of it in our house um I usually maybe you don't but when I'm using my laptop I usually keep a little piece of tape over the camera and a little piece of tape over the microphone I don't know why I just do that you know it's just a habit I have but I took it off one night and U cuz I had to do a zoom U call with someone and I had the tape off the camera and I had the zoom call sat down on the couch played the guitar a little bit went to bed got up the next morning opened my computer and what do I see this ad so I took a screenshot of it does that guitar look familiar to anyone close or exactly okay side by side so I went to Google images and I typed in ibenz semi Hol body guitar and I looked at every image all the way to the end that's all where it says you know no more images and there was no picture exactly like my guitar on the internet is that a coincidence or what I had my my tape off my camera for a couple of hours that was it coincidence you're all looking like I don't know I'm not not so sure could be a coincidence well then I started to think okay maybe it's not exactly like my guitar maybe it is a picture of my guitar but through software they transposed into an image and made an ad that would catch my eye the very next day wouldn't that be interesting if that actually were my guitar um there's another thing that could be happening here it could be that because I leave a profile on the internet that they figured out my personality and they figured out my income and they figured out what kind of guitar I would be likely to have and so they took a really good guess and that's what they came up with that's possible too right so which do you think it is did they profile me or did they get a picture of my guitar number one who thinks number one who thinks they profiled me no okay we've got a couple who thinks they got a picture of my guitar through my okay I don't know but here's the next question which of those things would be more troubling which of those two things would be more troubling that they could profile you that well Prett or that they could actually get into your living room and get a picture through your camera it's hard to say which is worse right they're both pretty bad anyone know this fell here all together now Mark Zuckerberg okay you notice anything interesting on this picture let's zoom in a little closer there he is and you see his beady little eyes there but if you look over to the left there's his personal laptop what do you see there tape over the camera and tape over the microphone why would he do that any idea anyone why would he do that you know I I started researching this uh subject in digital years centuries ago that would be like 2016 so in digital years that's long long long time ago only eight years but I started to read the interviews with developers like Zuckerberg and find places where they would ask them questions like is it possible for you to look through the camera of someone's smartphone if they give permission to the app to use the camera is it possible to hear through the microphone this is back in the olden days we're just figuring this out and they say well technology Wise It's possible to do that but we assure you we would never do a thing like that that's the kind of answers they give we would never it'd be illegal it would be immoral you can just take our word for it we would never look through your camera and we would never listen to your through your microphone okay next question if you did do do that would there be any way anyone else could find out well no not really you could never get caught you could never get caught no not not really okay so they have the ability how about motive do they have the motive they are in the information gathering business that's what they do so that they can sell advertising so they've got the ability and they've got the motive and they can't get caught are we that naive are we that naive they can't get caught they have the ability and they have the motive and their profit depends on it and what we have from them is their word that's what we have to go on we have their word we will never look through your camera we'll never listen through your microphone has anyone ever given an app permission this app needs your camera access to your camera to work just a little something to think about where do you take that phone do you take it into the bathroom into the bedroom all through your house see you don't know what's on the other side of that we just see the I I have one here oh I left it I have a smartphone okay I carry it around but you're carrying around a spy device just remember that there's people behind there you only see the screen but they're just beyond that there's people that are running those things and pulling the strings so back 10 years ago when I started researching ing this topic by the way do we have a bottle of water somewhere okay I'm from the Northwest water falls from the sky there so you um this brand new thing this wave of technology that came down and people were jumping in and getting involved and I was feeling a little easy some uneasy about it something's off about this something just doesn't seem right and couldn't quite put my finger on what was thank you [Music] brother and I would hear the preachers would throw out comments to warn people that some of these apps and some of these things that are coming out might not be good for you and it was very vague and very general and I couldn't really see put my finger on what the problem was after all look at what all these wonderful things they promised they can do for you but it was a burden for me so I started to re rearch resarch and I realized why it was so General because it's such a huge subject and ministers have a lot to do they've got to teach the word they got to manage a church and it really takes a lot of concentration and a specialty to get your mind around what's going on out there and then the Lord started to deal with me well why don't you do it so I started researching we just finished a book I have a partner that works with me it's by that same title choose digital Holiness so I've actually got for you tonight is a whole book and about 12 sessions crammed into one evening so if there's a lot of information that's why but any of this that we're going through tonight if you want to find out more about it we'll just stop when we run out of time but we've got more information to back up the things that we throw out here tonight the book was actually designed as a workbook that a church or youth group could go through together with a chapter on a subject and then some discussion questions and you can work through all the issues as a group hasn't been reviewed yet by a church but I would like some church to try it and give us some feedback because we want what we're putting out there to really be helpful to people so churches Christians in general jumped into the wave and started getting all these products and these phones and these apps on their phones and message Believers in general jumped into the pool to this is something brand new with the rest of the world and everyone was doing it because everyone was doing it nothing succeeds like success that's part of the marketing strategy is to get everyone doing it and they asked uh Mark Zuckerberg what are you going to do to the the people who don't sign up for your Facebook which he was starting at that time and he said simple you just get their friends and once you get their friends you get them because everybody wants to be with their friends did it work of course it did well last year in 2023 so now we're 10 13 years later the Surgeon General issues an advisory that social media is harmful to mental health just like they used to put warnings on the packs of you know boxes of cigarettes I hope they still do harmful to your mental health isn't that wonderful after 10 years after a sharp rise in everything bad I've got lots of graphs I could show you suicide depression everything bad that coincides exactly with this digital wave that came out so after 10 years of that they come out with you know we think these things might be harmful by the time the world notices a problem it's way way way way the horse has left the barn a long time ago the trains left the station we're way down the road and now they're using phrases like I'll quote one of them we are in the middle of a National Youth Mental Health crisis that's a quote from the Surgeon General and we think that social media might have a part of it oh my could the church and because we got into this too and are showing a lot of the same problems could the church have avoided it well the world isn't going to be warned but the church should be warned and threat should be identified by the Holy Ghost if we are listening even now the government is putting most of their focus on harms to young people well I'm going to give a little news flash 10 years from now they might figure out that it's not just young people that are being harmed right it's human beings of all ages that's why everyone who knows someone who has a smartphone was invited tonight it's I'm not a prophet but it's much more than a youth crisis even though we have lots of young people here it's scrambling God's provided way and that has negative repercussions that go through every strata of people adults of all ages are damaged families marriages the fabric of society are threatened democracies you can read about some of that in the book if you want to go that deep it's even threatening democracies and the Surgeon General might figure that out eventually also but they're behind the curve so I'm inviting Believers to prayerfully look at some of what we've reach searched and be ahead of the problem and get ahead of the problem why because there are new things coming down now that are about to explode on an unprepared world so with the first wave we're in damage control for the next wave we have a chance to be ahead of the problem before it hits and what's coming down now is many more times dangerous than social media ever was and more addictive I'm going to show some highlights we started a website also I had it on the first screen digital holiness. org so we're have that as a repository of information as we find out new things we can post it on there and hopefully help people be informed information and tools still under construction but we're lowbudget and we're just a couple of brothers so we're doing the best we can so if I say something here that tweaks you you can go to that and and read more about it so when I began speaking on this in the beginning I sensed a little reluctance among Believers even to talk about it and that was puzzling this is something big that our people are getting involved in shouldn't we be probing it and talking about it and I understand a little more why now there's actually spiritual forces there's demonic forces involved and in some of the longer presentations we can show you in quotes where some of this has been identified already in the message if you study the message and the scriptures together you can put a puzzle together that we should have known that some of these things were coming so you young people thank you for coming I know that you're often the Target and you get preached at but you're going to find out very quickly that um I believe young people should be spoken to respectfully you're very smart you go to school you do amazing things and you don't need to be talked down to so I'm going to speak to you respectfully and gently that's how brother random talked to young people go find some of the on the tapes where he had young people's meetings and see how respectfully and gently he spoke to young people and so I believe in emotions but this isn't going to be that kind of meaning and you don't have to be whipped up into a frenzy you can be spoken to in a by the Lord in a calm orderly meeting and you don't have to put be put under a guilt trip and con ition either I believe you just need to be shown the facts so that's what we're going to do tonight you deserve to know what's going on you don't need to be manipulated now that's what these platforms are trying to do is manipulate you but they attract you first what kind of Life do you want to have the choices you make determine the kind of life you're going to have or depend depending on the Holy Spirit to help you make those choices so this digital wave that came on the world the world was unprepared for we were not expecting it the church was not prepared for it and that little subsection of the church called the message was not prepared for it either what am I talking about it's pretty much anything that comes on a screen so that could be a video game it could be Skype it could be a phone it could be an app it could be a program and eventually it'll get Beyond screens onto Holograms but right now it's on screens and they come making many promises to us they're going to give us things they say things that are so attractive that we would almost jump at without thinking like a fish would take bait Mark Zuckerberg says we're just connecting people with people what's wrong with that what we didn't notice was so many of these things it's giving us one thing but it's taking away something more valuable see and you're gaining the thing and you have all your attention on that but it's taking away something more valuable um it would help I think to learn from our past mistakes so there's two common mistakes I think that have been made by believers well-meaning brothers and sisters ministers everybody but I've boiled it down to two there's probably more but there's two that recur this is a balance sheet I'm sure some of you have seen it it has all of your assets and income on one side and on the other your expenses your bills your liabilities so when this digital age burst upon us it showed us the asset side this is what you're going to gain these are all the things you're going to be able to do it didn't show us the cost side maybe didn't even know what the cost side was and any business any budget any family any government if you're working from one side of a balance sheet can you make good decisions no you need both sides let's think about the tactics of the serpent he offered something to the woman you're going to gain this this wisdom you're going to gain you're going to gain gain gain and then he gave her a dose of fomo who knows what fomo is fear of missing out if you don't listen to me you're going to be missing out he didn't show her the cost side in all those years have his his tactics changed no so he would be still doing the same thing he will offer something you you perceive is valuable when you take it he takes away something much more valuable so technology that is in the world today what is the source and the origin of Technology message Believers that listen to the tapes occasionally technology comes from the Devil the Lord will use it sometimes but he's not the author of it it's not going to be there on the other side see so technology is offering something and when it is we better stop a moment back up and say wait a minute what's the catch what is it taking away don't just jump right in so that was the first mistake I think we jumped in too quickly without thinking and we took the bait I put myself in that it looked really good but the cost started to show up after a while and whenever I speak on this topic usually there's someone who will come up to me afterward and give me a list of all the benefits so if you're that person I look forward to seeing you after but let I know the benefits I understand I'm just saying that we need to look at the other side of this too get the whole picture together so so the second mistake if that made sense I just made this little graph here this is what I call the resistance and Temptation scale so whichever is stronger that's the way you go so if your temptation is stronger than your resistance your Temptation wins out if your resistance is stronger than your Temptation then your resistance wins out so all these things come and the young people start using them and the ministers and the pastors don't understand them and it takes a lot of work and they can't possibly articulate all the dangers even though they kind of sense it's there so they take this shortcut by putting emphasis all the emphasis on the resistance side of the scale to the neglect sometimes of dealing with the Temptation side but by the holy ghost in the scriptures you can actually reduce the weight of the Temptations you can work on both sides of this so the advice usually comes in this abbreviated form we just need to get the Holy Ghost if we get the Holy Ghost we will be able to overcome all the Temptations and we said amen and I say Amen but Turn the Page how does the Holy Ghost do that you have to drill down a little bit if we examine how the Holy Ghost helps you to overcome Temptations there's a lot more to the story than that he strengthens your ability to resist temptation and he teaches you how to avoid Temptation I'll show you a few examples this is in the scriptures I don't have the time here to do 10 scriptures so we'll do three if we don't uh is that all on there oh it's not all on there okay the Lord knoweth how to deliver The Godly out of Temptation 2 Peter 2:9 you'll see a pattern here as you go through the scriptures there's so many of them that are like this and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil that's in the Lord's Prayer watch and pray that you enter not into temptation if you haven't been watching for this sometimes we translate in our mind lead us not into sin we we substitute sin but it always says not always but so much of the time the emphasis is defeated at the Temptation level before it gets to the sin level I'll give you one more example get the Holy Ghost is always the right advice but it doesn't go far enough sin is overcome at the Temptation therefore if you have have the Holy Ghost he will be teaching you how to minimize the Temptations you face how many believe that Timothy remember Timothy in the Bible had the Holy Ghost God's Great you know one of his great Apostles and one of Paul's uh favorite men that he leaned upon so Paul writes these letters to Timothy and he gives him some advice that might not all be on the screen do you have your Bibles second Timothy 222 that's all twos 2 Timothy 2 22 pull it up pull it right up second Timothy 2:22 and I kind of divide it into three different um phrases here so we can break it down because there's three things in this verse flee also youthful lust so this older Minister talking to the younger Minister both Having the Holy Ghost but adversative conjunction instead of that do this but follow righteousness Faith charity and peace and with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart now that's loaded Timothy resist okay you do need to resist but the word that Paul chooses is even stronger flee get out of exposure to youthful lusts that's the Temptation you're fleeing the temptation but follow and that's not like following someone on social media follow righteousness Faith charity and peace with everyone else on your platform no see he's got the church in there with them that call on the name of the Lord out of a pure heart so he's got a social group for you these kinds of people are your social group this is what you're running away from and this is what you're running away to in one little verse there he wipes out a lot of the things that we could stumble over it's one little verse contains all of that the Holy Ghost is teaching avoidance of Temptation work on the avoidance side of the scale to get Temptation down to a level where you can resist so we're going to get practical in a moment we're doing a little bit of theory to start with but I want to get to write down to how exactly do we do that so I'll have a slide in a minute that we can look at we're doing good and all of this is in the workbook too so keep that in your mind I'm going to hit one more thing and then we'll Circle back around but brother Mark I'm not really tempted by Youthful lusts well you're tempted by something I guarantee you there's Temptations for older people too brother Mark I'm just keeping in touch with my friends and family on these platforms maybe you are but I have six words for you to ponder it wasn't so from the beginning six words that's right let's look at this little chart here there's quite a bit here to look at God's provided way for our time and attention God actually has a way for it when he designed us he also thoughtfully designed the society that we would live in that would meet our needs organically it's like a glove made for a hand and a hand made for a glove so God made both he made both the society you would live in and he and he structured you and it's in a balance so all those things work in a balance so if you start changing and messing around with the society structure or the individual either way you mess up God's Perfect Balance so I took this from the Israelite calendar because the Lord was setting up an entire nation and all of their needs so their physical emotional social all their needs would be met in the way that God set it up so you've got right in the middle the intimate family group so that was the where it starts with and they have constant daily attention in the Israelite worship they would have what we would call church or synagogue weekly so that puts you into a larger circle of people other families okay very simple and then as a nation all the way on the outside you see uh annual events so the Israelite family three times a year travels to Jerusalem and I'm sure with all the other Israelite families that travel also it's like going to camp and they see these other people once or twice or three times a year so they have a much larger circle of people there that they're connected with so they've got the daily the yearly and the weekly so all of your social needs are met through that what social media does through technology this is how it's going to scramble God's provided way it takes every distant relationship that's way out there and puts it right down into your immediate daily Circle that's good that's what it does and God never designed it that way that's right he didn't design you that way you don't operate that way that's a good thing they say well it's a good thing for the developers because then you have to be on there all the time to maintain those relationships that God never ordained for you to have anyway at least not in that kind of frequency our time and attention they're the only things God gave us that's all we have is our time and our tension it cannot expand endlessly to embrace an infinite number of people if we are giving time and attention to maintaining on a daily basis distant relationships and this becomes a religion too because it has a reward and a guilt if you don't maintain those if you didn't reply oh then you've got this social pressure this social guilt that didn't come from the Lord it came from the platform now they've got a guilt trip on you you've got to reply to it's false guilt it causes you if you're deceived by this to defraud your primary relationships wow because you have t less time and attention for him you're trying to maintain this whole huge it was not so from the beginning W Paul said it do not defraud one another that's a scripture well there's a lots of ways you could defraud it's not just Financial there's lots of ways you can defraud people of your time and attention Jesus said it in Mark 10:19 it's all through the law of Moses defraud not your brother what do we owe each other we don't owe every person the same way you don't owe Those Distant relationships the same attention that you owe that the God put right in your house your husband your wife your family all those people there has to be a focus you actually don't have the emotional resources to do it you'll wear yourself out that's why we start getting all these repercussions of of depression and and this worn out feeling it weakens families it weakens primary relationships husband and wife relationship ships parent child relationships the Surgeon General hasn't figured this part out yet I think they will I hope they do but by the word of God we can see the Lord didn't set it up that way because of social media many times every day people pull away from interaction with a live person to maintain a relationship with some digital image of a person which isn't the real them anyway it's a carefully curated version of them so all relationships don't have the same priority I'll just tell you a story I was I came to a hotel one time and I was trying to check in and there was one person at the desk and there was kind of a line forming behind me because the phone kept ringing and every time the phone rang the clerk would leave dealing with me and deal with the person on the phone and it happened like three or four times in a row and eventually I'm saying hey I'm here they're out there deal with me you know that's kind of what it's like God wants us to have real face-to-face relationships with the people that are in our Circle so it scrambles God's Perfect Design it was not so from the beginning brother Mark I have to use it for school I have to use it for work in eight years I've encountered a few of these questions and they're they're legitimate they're legitimate up in the Northwest we have spiders and they uh they make these webs do you have those here yeah okay I'm I'm not from around here all right so the question why does a spider not not get caught in his own web because not all of the web is sticky and he knows where to step so those longitudinal framing strands that go through if he puts his feet on those he doesn't get stuck the other bugs don't know that so he can crawl all over that web but the ones that go horizontally in between those are sticky so just by way of example and I put this up as an example Le but it's always evolving so don't engrave that down as what's safe and what isn't uh but the business model of many platforms it is their business model to be sticky they have to be sticky that's how they profit there's others that aren't and so their business is to grab and hold as much of your attention as they can how do they do it by demanding your attention no through attraction they do it through attraction so using supercomputers they crack the code on your brain and learn what attracts you and what holds you you aren't just looking at that little device behind there is supercomputers that are more powerful than the military has and their one job is to crack the code on you you just see the little device there's a huge machine behind that thing creates a new type of addiction back in the old days it was like alcohol addiction and if someone had an alcohol addiction and they were a little bit embarrassed about it they would go into the bathroom shut the door take the drink there nowadays people might go into the bathroom close the door and get on their smartphone or the closet because they know something's a little bit wrong there it's a sign of an addiction what do these platforms want from you let's talk about that for a minute what do they want from you they want to have the most intimate place the most intimate place in your life that's what they want the most intimate place they want to be your closest buddy they want to be where you go for Comfort they want to be the first thing you look at in the morning and the last thing at night do they have the right to that place Christians that ought to be a little bit of a problem for a Christian sure because the most intimate place in a Christian's life is already taken by the Lord the place is not open the Lord has that place the next place is your husband and wife husband or wife the next place would be your family the next place would be your church the Believers where you Fellowship okay so how far down that list is the platform supposed to be quite a ways down yeah amen and what they want to do is budge do you ever budge in line in school they want to budge all the way to the front of the line and be the most important thing the most intimate thing in your life let's put it this way these platforms want the place in your heart that God has a good that's what they want they want the place that God has amen well we could go a little farther they want to be your God Amen some things on the internet are much more neutral we know that navigation tools such as the ones that got me here from the hotel today I turn that thing on and it's not trying to get me back when I turn it off it's not sticky it's just useful some things are like that navigation tools maybe email maybe some Commerce certain things online classes their business model isn't dependent on being my God or my buddy they're providing a service so this is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil so both things are in there that's why it's tricky that's why I made this little uh graphic silly as it is there's good in there useful things and evil things that can trap you and Rob you so we have to be paying attention to the difference anything can be addictive but some things are designed to be addictive and the shareholders that have invested in it demand that be addicted because they need users does their business model require your engagement for them to profit yes or no if yes be very careful it's sticky it's a sticky part of the web okay I told you we get into some practicals this is what we call the digital intervention scale and it kind of moves from left to right so what level of intervention you do you need so I'm not going to tell you that but this is something that you need to decide when we did the camp in Chile over 500 young people and we did an anonymous survey with them and the vast majority were not satisfied with how they were handling their device as a Christian and they were good young people but in an anonymous survey they would admit that they're not satisfied would you like to be satisfied so we developed this as a road map to get you there and older people too it's not a matter of just trying harder how about a strategy so we've got these are different things you could do on a device we'll just use a phone for an example but it could also be a computer so on the left here we've got a wide openen phone there's no restrictions on it and way over on the right side we have no phone believe it or not I have known people that have gone to that level but if your faith is important to you you're going to do what it takes so what this will do for you is it's going to allow you to cycle through and try a level and if it's not working you can go up to the next level so the next level native filters what is already on your device that you can set up to manage your screen time to not go places you know you shouldn't go to not take the clickbait whatever it is is there's native filters then the next level up self monitoring with extra filters so you can get apps that will actually help you manage your device you can try that so you cycle through that nope it didn't work brother Mark I'm still failing takes a brave person to admit it monitoring with a partner okay I know people who have done this and there's apps that you can get well have some of them on the website where they'll pair you up with another person where you can kind of look over each other's shoulder see none of this is imposed on you you you decide to do this this is all your own choice we call it choose digital Holiness what do you want to be what's your goals outsourced monitoring putting the filtering controls into the hands of another person I am actually doing that for someone right now if I'm going to get another app on my phone brother Mark you have to put in the password before I can put it on so this person has to hand me their phone I put in the password what do you need this app for we have a little conversation we put it on they come back a week later and say brother Mark we got to take that up back off it's happened it's happened I have the humility to do do that but give another person that level of control how important is your faith to you to you you know if you're about to lose your salvation if you're if you're in a tail spin sometimes you have to get pretty radical to break these things because the addictions can be really strong the sanct ofh I came up with that little name there that's a phone that we don't have available yet but I hope to that you could order that's already um almost like a company would have restrictions on the phone out of the box that you've got to go through headquarters to change anything on it so they have those in businesses all the time I think it'd be great for families if there were such a thing and then all the way on the other side no phone at all I don't know where the what what did they call the one that you had the dumb the the Light phone the Light phone that just only does certain things you know you can't it's just a different device it's not a smartphone but it only does certain things I don't have that on here but that's another option you can do if nothing changes nothing changes so if you're not satisfied with how this is going for you if nothing changes nothing changes so we put this together so you can say okay it's not working maybe it's time for me to try another level this will work if you stay with it okay if you keep cycling through it you'll eventually get to an a level where it will work the only way it won't work is if you give up if you don't give up and you stay with it and keep cycling through at high levels higher and higher until I'm satisfied I'm overcoming then maybe you're building some strength what are we doing those scriptures we taking the Temptation level down who teaches you to do that the Holy Ghost this is how the Holy Ghost helps you overcome by avoiding those Temptations we're doing good we did this in our home Bible study laws versus disciplines two different things this whole presentation is on the disciplined side of the chart those are two different things laws are externally imposed disciplines are voluntarily chosen laws are mandatory disciplines are self-developed laws are formal disciplines are customizable to what's going to work for you laws are fixed disciplines are adaptable laws are enforced disciplines are self-regulated the purpose of laws are to EST establish and maintain order and fairness in a group the purpose of a discipline is to support growth and development toward your chosen goals I kind of like to throw in this this little question that's off the topic once in a while but when the Lord came and and brought a message to the world which of these categories was it in which of these two categories did Brother Branham operate in as he's bringing it to the world not going to answer it but it's an interesting thing to think about because the age of law is a past dispensation God isn't going backwards he's trying to grow us up as Sons and Daughters of God he wants us to volunteer into this Kingdom amen could it be that most of it is disciplines and we opt into it and we decide to do it because we have decided this is what we want to be it's our choice it's not imposed on us brother Mark how are we doing for time few more minutes yeah okay we're doing good this seems like a lot of work anyone go through college it's a lot of work right some things you just have to work for this seems like a lot of work let's just can't we just do a shortcut well let's go to one of the great Psalms in the Bible brother Mark why don't I just rely on the Lord to protect me he's good he like to protect his children let's go to Psalm 91 It's a Wonderful Psalm of protection you can see it on the screen you can look it up one of the greatest promises all the greatest many of the greatest Promises of protection in the Bible in Psalm 91 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he's my refuge in my Fortress my God in him I will trust so if you know the answer to this next question don't blurt it out so the question is this Psalm is quoted in the New Testament by which New Testament character this Psalm is quoted in the New Testament by a very important New Testament character who look at it real close did you see you have an idea David no it it'd be someone in the New Testament Jesus no not Jesus that's good though in Sunday school that's the answer to two out of three questions so that's always a good guess not Jesus it is quoted in the New Testament you know Pastor don't you okay was that yeah go ahead Satan exactly it's quoted by Satan to Jesus to him to entice him to rely upon the protection of God to voluntarily walk into a known danger he quoted Psalm 91 to him Satan was tempting Jesus to commit the sin of presumption presuming upon the protection of God to protect you from dangers that you could avoid and he was quoting it accurately but he's missing applying it to the situation this is one of the devil's big three he had three Temptations He had three pitches that he threw interesting that he would pick this one as one of the three if he could bring down Jesus Christ the son of God so it's got to be kind of tricky one that people stumble over frequently misunderstanding the protections of God to put yourself into a dangerous situation jump off the temple Jesus I've got a scripture stand on that scripture word of God is true right stand on that scripture don't you know the Lord will protect you and if Jesus had taken Satan's interpretation he would have jumped do we take Satan's interpretation no but if you are deliberately swimming next to a world poool will God protect you he might but you don't have a promise to stand on then he might be gracious and protect you for a while he might have to let you learn a lesson if you're walking into known dangers all over the Internet there are digital whirlpools and they want to suck you down brother Mark I'm just depending on the protection of the Lord the protection of the Lord will get you away from that thing that's right that's how he protects you he gets you away away from that thing he'll teach you not to swim there he doesn't give you blanket perect protection when you know there's a danger there all right oh we'll do that one in a minute anyone know Sister Brooke well you'll like to meet her someday wonderful sister um that's on the website you can look that over we hope to fill it out a little more but I encourage you to think about that do I need to move up a notch do I need to move up a notch am I serious about my faith am I serious about not swimming next to whirlpools that could drag me down and destroy my faith all right couple little things and then we'll be done sister Brooke um I'm sorry I don't have the video but um a lot of what you find on the internet is what we call impulse Temptations impulse Temptations are really interesting they're based on impulse Temptation something that you didn't have forethought about but somehow it just throws something at you that in the moment is kind of hard to resist and what they've learned about impulse Temptations is I I've actually researched this is an Impulse temp Temptation has a life of about 20 20 seconds and in that 20 seconds it's really strong but if you can get past the 20 seconds it Fizzles out so a lot of the failings that happened happen in that moment so we created the Philippians 4:8 block let's turn to it it takes about 20 seconds to quote Philippians 4:8 wow had a nice gentle pace so if you become a clickto maniac and you just can't help but click on that you need a block you need a 20 second Block in that 20 seconds you can get away from that click too so this is your Escape we actually had a lot of the young people record themselves and send us a video of them reading Philippians 48 we've posted some of them on the website and do it nicely and do it energetically or do it creatively or do it with your personality or do it hanging upside down from a tree like one sister did but Philippians 4:8 it's the Temptation blocker did anyone find it any Vol anyone volunteer to stand up and read it for us is your Temptation block I have to volunteer somebody okay finally Breen whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatever are amen amen so in that moment so you're in that moment and recognize it okay I'm in that moment grab your block Philippians 4:8 read it or have it memorized you'll get down you go this isn't so hard and you're on to something else and you didn't stumble in something that could have just took you down a Whirlpool of something really bad but you need that little block when Jesus blocked The Temptations of the devil what did he use scripture yeah so it works it really does work I knew one brother that actually he identified the place the room in the house where the problem usually happen happened and on the door he printed the words finally Brethren so as soon as you're headed into that room okay that whole scripture is running through his mind so that's what we're doing when we talk about tools and tactics it's little things like that that you need to have to survive this battle and they're in the scripture I'll show you one more uh then another little thing then we have a song for you we'll be about done um one of the the great stumbling grounds for a lot of people is YouTube and there's a little thing you can get called YouTube DF so it's a um it goes on your Chrome browser and what it does is it takes away all the recommendations because the way that YouTube works of course we know you put one thing in and it shows 10 other things you might like if you're trying to learn how to cook something or fix your car and you're only looking for one thing and 20 minutes later you're into several videos and then you go how did I get here because it showed them to you but if you put this extension on your browser only the thing that you look for will come up so you aren't getting the recommendations Temptation avoidance and it's free so there's there's different ones this is one DFD DTU distraction free for for YouTube but there's different ones that kind of do the same thing actually what I did for a while is I turned my phone into black and white you can actually take the color out of it and then it's less appealing then you spend less time there just little practical things like that can really help you get that wrestle that thing down get it under control um for people who are Really Brave and only a couple people have done this but there's a chapter on it in the book we call it the 30-day digital detox and what is that it's exactly what you think it is you notify everybody you're going to have to get a hold of me some other way if you want to because I'm taking everything out for 30 days except what I need for for safety or income it's absolute necessity but I am completely off of everything for 30 days sometimes see the people have done this and I know a few of them that have it's sometimes easier to build up from a clean slate starting from nothing than to try to pick one thing out one at a time so after 30 days and we know it takes about 30 days to defeat an addiction and most of the pull of it is gone they can reevaluate and okay oh what do I read really need and they only bring that back into their life so the people have have done this say you know it's it's amazing to realize how much of a pull it had on you that's the Revelation they get this had a much bigger pull on me than I realized until I was away from a while and then it's like almost like waking up from a dream oh the real world is here I didn't realize all this is here and the other thing is I was so busy before I just couldn't get everything done and now I have all this time see time is getting sucked away stolen there's a thief out there a Time Thief that's right you don't gain anything from it it's just stealing your life away um so that's two tools and uh we like to have people involved in this ministry you can subscribe if you want to but if you come up with something that really works and you want to share with others that's really helped me we'd like to have those things too um and we'll just have a repository of of support so we don't want to fight this battle alone see that that's what the platforms want they want you on your own the devil is like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour but the the lion doesn't attack the whole herd it attacks the Stray he's trying to get you on your own you're a lot easier to defeat so if you work on this together and we're all supporting each other so we can defeat this wow this is amazing you guys did so good you're so quiet what we known for that's what you're known for tring you know they're really known for being noisy in South America but I on that night they were quiet though I don't know if they were exhausted or what stay but they they stayed away wait then we had a little uh time for questions and answers afterwards and they had some really great questions uh we have a song for you I guess could we take anyone just has a question you're dying to ask or a comment or some insight we'll do a little song for you and then that'll be enough for tonight I think you can take a question if you have one if you don't that's okay I sprung it on you I didn't tell you to have a there there be questions later on maybe I'll have a follow-up meeting after I'm gone brother Daniel and they'll have a little more discussion about it yes sister well the smartphones are much more dangerous because of the apps and uh their ability to access the internet so that they they can have a lot more ability to get you um capture your spirit I'll put it that way so well we could everything is a smartphone now but there are some phones that you know what the other one would be a flip phone that all it does is dial so you can talk to someone in voice call but all right any anything else comments questions or flowers or bricks have you have you heard of the book digital minimalism by yes yeah I've studied a lot of C stuff and he's one of the one that kind of started this digital uh detox idea with college students a lot of their experiences are in his books too yep digital minimalism yep y That's a good one so even the world is is figuring out some of these things in fact there are schools I've I've heard about him recently where the whole school is detoxing together and communities and people not even Believers not even Christians just recognizing that it's not doing anything good for them well if the world can do that I think churches could probably do that too right we should be ahead of the game not behind so our song we're going to do today is based on um Psalm 91 secret place so we'll have Josiah and Katie and my wife come up we'll do a little song for you thank you for listening so carefully I hope it was helpful you don't strap huh I'll sit here [Music] there is a secret place known only to the Lord hide me Lord hide me and when the V of troubled times are being poured hide me in your secret [Music] place his a to a to stand when this world burning FL shall Lord hide in [Music] your sheep hide [Music] me Lord hide me and when the of men are [Music] CCE hide me in your secet place safe is from his hand a place to rest a place to stand when this sad World in burning flames [Applause] shall Lord hide me in your secret hide Me In
