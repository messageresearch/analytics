[1:29] My heart was distressed

[5:43] You may be seated.
[5:46] Um
[5:48] Sarah, are you you ready to sing?
[5:52] And we got a couple of song specials.
[5:55] And you want to take the request right
[5:57] now while she's getting ready.
[6:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Ernie, could you check in the in
[6:12] the front for please?
[6:24] Sister Crystal, is Izzy not here?
[6:26] Oh, there you are. Okay.
[6:30] Uh, the reason I'm saying Sister Izzy,
[6:33] she has a very important prayer request
[6:35] here. First, we'll start with our praise
[6:37] report.
[6:39] Sister Crystal says this, "My nephew
[6:41] Christopher Collins is doing better.
[6:43] still sore, trouble walking, the
[6:46] swelling is going down, and the pain is
[6:48] getting better. The doctor says
[6:51] it is going to take four weeks to heal.
[6:54] And thank you all for all the prayers.
[6:56] Sister Chris Maria, I appreciate sister
[6:58] Crystal giving us a report on on
[7:00] everything that um we pray about
[7:03] something and you don't hear about it
[7:05] and you want to hear a report.
[7:08] Um couple prayer requests here.
[7:12] Um, Lydia Peterson, young Lydia writes
[7:15] this, "My step cousin's mom was recently
[7:18] diagnosed with stage four cancer.
[7:20] Although I don't know her name, I know
[7:22] that she is not a Christian and her
[7:25] daughter Elena is only 13. Please pray
[7:29] that she will receive complete healing
[7:30] and salvation for her." And Elelliana,
[7:34] I'm sorry, I said Elena. Elelliana.
[7:40] It's a young mother with a child only 13
[7:44] years old. So, I'm sure that we can all
[7:47] relate to that. And then Izzy writes
[7:50] this.
[7:52] Please pray for the Nut family. Stephen,
[7:55] my friend, he took his own life. Please
[7:58] remember the family in prayer at this
[8:01] difficult time.
[8:04] Sister, that is that the one that you
[8:06] and I prayed for before or is that okay?
[8:08] This is a different one. Let's all
[8:11] stand.
[8:13] Friends,
[8:14] I do appreciate
[8:17] these two young ladies, Izzy and Lydia.
[8:22] I can see a burden that they have for
[8:24] other people.
[8:26] And
[8:29] can you imagine going through life,
[8:33] being born, and going all the way to
[8:35] your death,
[8:37] and no one has ever prayed for you.
[8:40] And I I look at these these young ladies
[8:42] and they have a burden for these other
[8:44] people.
[8:46] And if nothing else, and I think it's a
[8:50] very very important thing
[8:53] that these people have been prayed for.
[8:56] And I believe that God has required our
[8:59] prayers. That's the way that he does
[9:01] things. He set prayer in order.
[9:04] And we are when we pray for one another,
[9:07] we are being obedient to his word. Let's
[9:11] bow our heads. If you would have a
[9:13] request on your heart that you would
[9:15] like to make known to the Lord Jesus,
[9:18] either for yourself or someone else, if
[9:20] you would lift up your hand before him,
[9:25] sees all things and said that wherever
[9:28] two or three are gathered in my name,
[9:31] there will be in the midst of them.
[9:33] Friends, if we believe that to be true,
[9:36] then we believe that he is here with us
[9:39] and he sees our hands go up before him.
[9:44] Our father,
[9:47] we pray, Lord, for salvation and for
[9:49] healing,
[9:51] for this mother and and this daughter,
[9:56] Lord, that you'd comfort the family and
[9:58] that you'd strengthen them.
[10:00] And Lord, we know that
[10:03] when you heal us of our sicknesses,
[10:06] that if time goes on, we would just get
[10:08] sick again. But Lord, when you heal our
[10:11] soul and when you change our soul,
[10:13] Father, it it never gets sick again. And
[10:16] we live all we can live through
[10:18] eternity, Lord, in your presence. We
[10:21] pray for salvation
[10:24] of this woman with cancer, Lord, that
[10:26] you'd help her.
[10:28] Most of all, Lord, we we pray for the
[10:30] healing of her body. But Lord, when she
[10:33] receives that healing, we pray that she
[10:34] would look her eyes up to Calvary and
[10:37] see where her healing comes from.
[10:40] Lord, pray for this family that lost
[10:43] this boy, took his own life. Can imagine
[10:48] the hardship, suffering that this family
[10:50] is going through. Lord to pray that you
[10:53] would comfort them
[10:56] and heal their hearts, Father. And may
[10:59] they find somehow someway may they find
[11:02] Christ in this situation.
[11:05] For every uplifted hand,
[11:08] Lord, we pray that
[11:11] you would answer each request. You saw
[11:13] them, Lord. We do. We do it in obedience
[11:16] to you.
[11:18] And now Lord, we ask that our prayers
[11:21] would come up before you as a sweet
[11:23] smelling savor as the the altar incense
[11:27] came up before you in times of old.
[11:29] Lord, let our prayers come up before you
[11:30] in the same way.
[11:33] Father, most of all,
[11:36] very most, and really the only thing is
[11:38] we ask for your will in our prayers in
[11:42] all these situations because we know
[11:44] that your will is better than our will.
[11:46] In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[12:00] God bless you. I felt like these songs
[12:02] needed a little bit of an explanation.
[12:04] Um, it's a medley of songs that we used
[12:07] to sing here. One of them we all know
[12:09] for sure, but the other ones it's been a
[12:11] long time. Um, but we used to sing
[12:13] these. I remember growing up in the
[12:14] tabernacle here singing these songs and
[12:16] they're just a focus on the coming of
[12:18] the Lord and keeping our hearts and
[12:21] minds
[12:22] looking ahead and pressing the battle.
[12:25] So, I hope you're blessed.
[12:37] Oh my comrades, see the signal [music]
[12:41] waving in the sky.
[12:45] Reinforcements [music] now appearing.
[12:49] Victory [singing]
[12:50] is mine.
[12:53] Hold the fort [music] for I am coming.
[12:57] Jesus signal still
[13:00] wave [singing] the answer back to
[13:03] heaven. By thy grace we will
[13:08] fierce and long the [music and singing]
[13:10] battle rages but our help is near.
[13:16] Onward comes [music] our great commander
[13:20] cheer. My comrades cheer
[13:23] and hold the fort for I am coming.
[13:27] [music] Jesus signal still [singing]
[13:31] wave the answer back to heaven.
[13:35] [singing] By thy grace [music] we will
[13:39] hold the fort for I am coming. [music]
[13:43] Jesus signal still
[13:47] wave the answer [music] back to heaven
[13:51] by thy grace we will [singing]
[14:00] when Jesus breaks [singing] the morning
[14:05] the host of heaven will sing [music]
[14:10] hosana
[14:12] in the highest.
[14:15] Christ is our conquering king.
[14:21] We'll clasp our hands [singing]
[14:23] together
[14:26] around that great white throne
[14:31] and join the angels [singing] singing.
[14:36] At last, at last we're home. [singing]
[14:41] When Jesus breaks the morning,
[14:46] the host of heaven [singing] will sing.
[14:51] Hosana
[14:53] in the highest.
[14:56] Christ [music] is our conquering king.
[15:01] We'll clasp our hands together
[15:06] around that great [music]
[15:09] white throne.
[15:11] and join the angels [singing] singing.
[15:16] At last, at last we're home.
[15:23] It will be worth [singing]
[15:26] it all.
[15:29] When we see Jesus, [music]
[15:35] life's trials, [singing]
[15:37] they'll seem so small. [music]
[15:41] When we see Christ, [singing]
[15:46] one glimpse of his dear face,
[15:52] all sorrow
[15:55] will erase.
[15:58] Oh, bravely [singing and music]
[16:00] run the race
[16:04] till we see Christ.
[16:10] It will be worth it all. [singing]
[16:15] When we see Jesus, [singing]
[16:21] life's trials, they'll seem so small.
[16:27] When we see Christ, [singing]
[16:32] one glimpse of his dear face,
[16:38] all [singing] sorrow will erase
[16:44] so [singing] bravely from [music]
[16:47] the race.
[16:49] Till [singing] we see Christ
[16:55] so bravely [singing]
[16:57] run this race
[17:00] till we [singing] see Christ.
[17:16] &gt;&gt; It will be worth it all. Amen.
[17:19] &gt;&gt; We we look at some of the things we've
[17:21] gone through or things that happened,
[17:24] but on that other side to say, "Lord, it
[17:26] was all for a reason."
[17:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Daniel just got a message,
[17:32] Brother John Loker
[17:34] and Sister Annie's wife, his wife's
[17:36] father just passed away. So, let's just
[17:39] bow our heads for a moment here. Lord,
[17:42] there's a a family that's hurting right
[17:44] now,
[17:46] but you're the great comforter, Lord.
[17:50] You took upon yourself wounds and
[17:53] brokenness and hurts
[17:55] so that you could be touched by the
[17:57] feeling of our infirmation.
[18:00] You're the great comforter, Lord.
[18:03] We don't have to always know the reasons
[18:05] why, Lord. We just want to trust in your
[18:07] peace and your rest, Lord. So go to the
[18:10] Logger family and all those associated
[18:12] even now and comfort them we pray in
[18:15] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[18:20] Amen. It's
[18:23] if as Lydia and AA come ready get ready.
[18:27] Let's sing that
[18:29] [clears throat]
[18:30] I claim the blood
[18:32] of course.
[18:34] I don't claim any goodness. I don't
[18:36] claim any self-righteousness. I claim
[18:38] what he's done for me.
[18:42] I claim the blood
[18:47] Jesus shed on Calary.
[18:55] Those preious [singing]
[18:57] [music] blood stains
[19:00] were made there just for me.
[19:07] for all [singing] my sins,
[19:11] [music]
[19:12] my sickness,
[19:14] and [singing]
[19:15] my pain.
[19:19] When I need healing,
[19:24] I claim [music]
[19:26] those precious blood stain.
[19:30] Claim them as you're singing. I claim
[19:33] the [music] blood
[19:36] Jesus shed on Calary.
[19:39] [singing and music]
[19:44] Those [music] precious
[19:46] blood stains
[19:48] [music] were made there just for
[19:52] [singing] me.
[19:56] for all [singing] my sins,
[19:59] [music] my sickness,
[20:02] and my pain.
[20:07] When I [singing]
[20:09] healing, [music]
[20:12] I claim those pre
[21:20] Have you ever stepped down a mountain
[21:23] too tall to climb?
[21:30] No way to get over no matter how hard
[21:34] you try.
[21:39] But somehow the Lord got you [music] to
[21:42] the other side.
[21:47] Can I get [singing] a witness? [music]
[21:57] Have you stood on the banks of a [music]
[22:00] Red Sea [singing]
[22:01] wrestling down?
[22:06] Cuz it's [music] too far [singing] to
[22:07] swim and too wide to get around.
[22:14] But the good Lord brought you [music]
[22:17] through walking on dry ground.
[22:22] Can I get [singing] a witness? [music]
[22:31] Can I get a witness?
[22:35] Can I get [singing] a hand raised high?
[22:40] Can I get a [singing] witness?
[22:43] Anybody [music] want to testify?
[22:48] If you [music] cried out [singing] for a
[22:51] mold
[22:52] and you've seen him do the impossible.
[22:56] [singing and music]
[23:01] Can I get a witness?
[23:06] [music]
[23:10] Are you standing in a fire and the
[23:12] flames won't let you go?
[23:17] But you're still holding
[23:19] [music and singing] on to a single
[23:20] thread of hope.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The Lord can [music] deliver and
[23:27] you won't even [singing] smell like
[23:29] smoke.
[23:32] Can I get a witness?
[23:37] Can I get [singing and music] a witness?
[23:41] Can I get a hand raised?
[23:45] Can I get a witness?
[23:48] Anybody [music and singing] want to
[23:49] testify?
[23:52] If you cried out for [singing] a miracle
[23:56] and you've [music] seen him do the
[23:58] impossible,
[24:02] can I get a witness? [singing]
[24:10] &gt;&gt; [music]
[24:12] &gt;&gt; If you can't [singing] stay silent,
[24:16] if you can't keep [singing] quiet, then
[24:19] here's your [music] chance.
[24:23] Can I get a witness? [singing]
[24:28] Can
[24:29] [music] I get a witness?

[24:36] [music and singing]
[24:38] Can I get a witness?
[24:41] Anybody [music]
[24:42] want to testify?
[24:45] If you cried out [singing] for a miracle
[24:49] and you've seen them do the impossible,
[24:52] [music]
[24:54] [singing]
[24:56] can I get a witness?
[25:05] Can I [singing and music] get a witness?
[25:21] It's they've been practicing after
[25:23] service after a lot of people have gone.
[25:26] So, Sister Lydia, thank you and God
[25:29] bless you and
[25:31] That's from brother Aaron. From Papa
[25:34] Brown. Hi, Papa Brown. My niece, my
[25:37] great niece here. Thank you and God
[25:39] bless you, Sean. Wasn't it good? Good to
[25:43] see you back.
[25:45] You know, our children could be
[25:46] somewhere else, but by the grace of God,
[25:49] they're here.
[25:52] There are many that wish or pray to have
[25:54] their children still around. So, when
[25:57] they're still here, you can thank God
[25:59] and be grateful. Amen. Let's sing
[26:06] as brother Lyall prepares to come on out
[26:09] to
[26:11] worthy worthy the lamb that was slain of
[26:13] course
[26:16] this whole
[26:18] thought process in in the songs I was
[26:20] just thinking about what he's done for
[26:22] me
[26:24] because really what have I done for him
[26:27] nothing to ear I can I can present this
[26:30] to you, Lord. It's worth this. No. Jesus
[26:33] paid it all.
[26:38] Worthy. [music]
[26:42] Worthy.
[26:48] Worthy.
[26:50] The lamb
[26:52] that was slain.
[26:57] Worthy, [music]
[27:02] worthy,
[27:07] worthy. [singing]
[27:09] The lamb
[27:11] that was slain.
[27:13] One more time.
[27:15] You're worthy,
[27:18] [music]
[27:21] worthy,
[27:26] worthy.
[27:28] The lamb
[27:30] that was slain.
[27:35] Worthy.
[27:40] Worthy.
[27:44] Worthy is [singing] the lamb
[27:48] that was slain.
[27:53] Worthy. [music]
[27:58] Worthy,
[28:02] worthy.
[28:04] The [singing] lamb
[28:06] that was slain,
[28:12] worthy,
[28:16] worthy,
[28:21] worthy.
[28:23] the lamb that was slain. [singing]
[28:31] How true.
[28:33] How true. He's the one that was worthy.
[28:36] And it's through his righteousness that
[28:39] we're able to approach the Lord, that
[28:41] we're able to gather together this
[28:43] evening in his name and around his word.
[28:49] I'll start with my usual good evening
[28:53] and thank you so much.
[28:58] We've been speaking of praise and
[29:00] worship of the Lord for several weeks.
[29:02] Last time, brother Josiah AO taught from
[29:05] John 4 that God is a spirit and must be
[29:09] worshiped in spirit and in truth.
[29:13] We realize that Jesus was a man. It was
[29:17] also God. Have you ever asked yourself
[29:22] how Jesus Christ of the New Testament
[29:26] could be a Jehovah God of the Old? In
[29:29] the Old Testament, the the Hebrew Bible,
[29:31] we read of the flood in Noah's time, the
[29:34] destruction of Sodom and Abraham's. The
[29:38] command to utterly destroy certain
[29:40] cities during the conquest of Canaan
[29:42] under Joshua, later under Saul.
[29:45] In the New Testament, we read that God
[29:48] so loved the world, he gave his only
[29:50] begotten son that whoever believed in
[29:53] him would not perish but have
[29:55] everlasting life that he forgave the
[29:57] very ones crucifying him.
[30:01] Doesn't the God of the Old Testament
[30:02] sometimes seem violent and harsh? Well,
[30:05] Jesus seemed to reach out in mercy and
[30:07] love to everyone.
[30:11] How can we reconcile this seeming
[30:14] contradiction of God's nature? Or is God
[30:18] really a committee of two or maybe three
[30:20] beings? A angry, vengeful one
[30:22] complimented by a merciful and forgiving
[30:24] one.
[30:26] Who is it that we are to worship?
[30:30] Before addressing this, let's approach
[30:32] our Lord once more together in prayer.
[30:38] Lord Jesus, we're in awe of you.
[30:41] We're so grateful, Lord, as we just
[30:44] sang, "Worthy, worthy is the lamb that
[30:48] was slain."
[30:49] Lord, we pray that you'd help us this
[30:51] evening, Lord, to lay aside anything
[30:53] that we may have brought in with us
[30:55] that's unpleasing to you. Help us to set
[30:58] aside the the weights, the cares of this
[31:01] world, the troubles, the the the things
[31:04] that, Lord, just just pull at us, Lord.
[31:07] and and again thinking of uh the locers
[31:09] and sister Anne and how she was able to
[31:12] go out there on Monday so she could be
[31:14] there at the time that her father
[31:16] passed. What a what a wonderful token of
[31:19] your love to that family, Lord. Lord, we
[31:22] just pray now as we're together this
[31:24] evening that you'd move by your spirit.
[31:25] That you'd answer questions, Lord, and
[31:28] Lord, stop me from saying anything that
[31:30] would cause people to stumble or to
[31:32] doubt, but Lord, that questions might be
[31:35] answered, Lord. And that and Lord, that
[31:37] you just draw us ever closer together to
[31:39] yourself and in yourself, Lord, that
[31:42] love of Christ shed or brought in our
[31:44] hearts. You said, Lord, that by this
[31:46] will all men know you're my disciples.
[31:48] Not by doctrines, not by [snorts] this
[31:51] and that, but by the love that we have
[31:54] one for another.
[31:57] Bring that to full fruition on our
[31:59] lives. Lord, we pray as we commit the
[32:01] remainder of this evening into your
[32:03] hands in Jesus precious name. Amen.
[32:09] For our opening scriptures, please turn
[32:12] with me to the first page in the
[32:15] biblical text, Genesis chapter 1. And by
[32:18] the way, the title screen image is of
[32:21] Genesis 1:1 and part of verse two from
[32:23] the Lengrad CEX. The same verses that
[32:26] Brother Joseph Hokensson recited to us
[32:29] in Hebrew at the conclusion of last
[32:30] Sunday evening service,
[32:34] but we'll do it in English.
[32:39] In the beginning, God Elohim created the
[32:43] heaven and the earth. And the earth was
[32:47] without form and void. Darkness was
[32:51] where? Upon the face of the deep.
[32:56] And the spirit of God moved, literally
[32:58] hovered.
[33:00] The perspective of the narrator moves
[33:02] from a distant observer who sees the
[33:04] universe from afar in verse one to the
[33:08] surface of the third planet in orbit
[33:12] around a star we call the sun in verse
[33:14] two. The spirit of God hovered upon the
[33:18] face of the waters. And God from the
[33:21] surface of the planet said, "Let there
[33:24] be light."
[33:26] And there was light.
[33:29] And God saw the light that it was good.
[33:33] And God divided the light from the
[33:36] darkness.
[33:38] God called the light day and the
[33:40] darkness he called night. The evening
[33:44] and the morning were the first day.
[33:48] From this we see that there was a
[33:50] beginning
[33:51] that God created the universe that his
[33:54] focus then moved to the surface of our
[33:57] planet. It was all created by God.
[34:00] Elohim, one of the name references of
[34:02] God in the Old Testament.
[34:05] Well, let's move to a another narrative
[34:08] of the creation. This time from the
[34:10] first chapter of the gospel according to
[34:13] John.
[34:18] In the beginning was the word. The word
[34:21] was with God. The word was God. The same
[34:25] was in the beginning with God. All
[34:28] things were made by him and without him
[34:30] was not anything made that was made.
[34:33] Tracks perfectly with the first verses
[34:36] of Genesis 1. In him was life,
[34:41] and the life was the light of men. The
[34:44] light shined in darkness. The darkness
[34:47] comprehended it not. Skipping down to
[34:49] verse 10. He was in the world. The world
[34:53] was made by him. The world knew him not.
[34:56] He came unto his own. His own received
[35:00] him not. But as many as received him, to
[35:03] them gave he power to become the sons of
[35:06] God, even to them that believe on his
[35:09] name,
[35:11] which were born not of blood, nor of the
[35:14] will of the flesh, nor of the will of
[35:16] man, but of God. And the word, which
[35:20] verses 1 to3 declared is the creator,
[35:23] and in fact is God, was made flesh and
[35:28] dwelt among us.
[35:30] And we beheld his glory, the glory as of
[35:32] the only begotten of the father, full of
[35:36] grace and truth.
[35:39] Please be seated.
[35:42] These two passages seem to confirm that
[35:46] Jesus of the New Testament is God of the
[35:49] Old Testament. We see in Genesis 1 that
[35:52] God Elohim created everything. And in
[35:55] John 1, we see that the God who created
[35:58] everything became flesh and a man we
[36:02] call Jesus.
[36:04] In Jesus we read was life and light.
[36:09] We see evidence of this in the Old
[36:11] Testament. life. Genesis 2 tells us,
[36:14] "The Lord God formed man of the dust of
[36:17] the earth and breathed into his nostrils
[36:19] the breath of life, and man became a
[36:24] living soul,
[36:27] light." When Moses led his people out of
[36:29] Egypt, we read in Exodus 13, "And the
[36:33] Lord," who? The Lord Yahweh went before
[36:39] Moses and the Israelites by day in a
[36:41] pillar of a cloud to lead them the way
[36:44] and by night. Huh? And a pillar of fire
[36:49] to give them light to go by day and
[36:52] night. He took not away the pillar of
[36:54] the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire
[36:57] by night from before the people. Here we
[37:02] see God in a light described as a pillar
[37:05] of fire.
[37:07] Many centuries later in the book of Acts
[37:10] chapter nine, we we read about Saul, a
[37:13] devout Pharisee, deeply knowledgeable
[37:16] about the Old Testament based on his
[37:18] understanding of the scriptures. He was
[37:20] an ardent persecutor of the early
[37:22] followers of Jesus.
[37:25] On a campaign to arrest more Christians,
[37:27] he was in route from Jerusalem to
[37:29] Damascus.
[37:32] And as Saul, later called Paul,
[37:35] journeyied, he came near Damascus, and
[37:38] suddenly there shined about him a light
[37:41] from heaven. He later says it was
[37:43] brighter than the noonday sun. And he
[37:47] and the company with him, he tells us
[37:49] later, fell to the earth.
[37:52] And only Saul heard a voice saying unto
[37:55] him, and he tells us later in the Hebrew
[37:58] tongue,
[38:00] Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? Sha
[38:04] Sha lane.
[38:09] And Saul said,
[38:11] Who are you, Lord? Lord, he recognized
[38:16] the light had to be supernatural from
[38:19] God and knew of Moses' journey of old.
[38:23] Lord, hidden in the light, who are you?
[38:27] And who? The Lord said, I am Jesus of
[38:32] Nazareth, he says later, whom thou
[38:34] persecutest, it is hard for thee to kick
[38:37] against the pricks.
[38:40] and Saul trembling and astonished.
[38:44] Astonished.
[38:46] You can be sure he was astonished to
[38:48] discover that the God he worshiped and
[38:49] served was the very one he was trying to
[38:52] destroy.
[38:54] Trembling and astonished, Saul said,
[38:57] "Lord, what will you have me do?"
[39:02] Paul recognized at that moment that
[39:05] Jesus Christ was Jehovah God.
[39:10] You know, I like to mix things up, not
[39:14] fall into a pattern. So, tonight I'm
[39:16] going to share with you a number of
[39:17] comments that were made by Brother
[39:19] Brandham related to the topic of
[39:21] tonight's lesson. Brother Brandham
[39:24] talked about this event in an absolute
[39:26] January of 1963. He said, "Oh, brother,
[39:29] do you see what I mean? That same Jesus
[39:32] that went up came back again on the day
[39:34] of Pentecost in the form of the Holy
[39:36] Ghost and fire. It should be upon the
[39:39] people doing the same thing he did
[39:41] because he said it would do it. Where
[39:44] are we at? See what I mean? Moses, the
[39:47] fire was in Moses. It left the bush.
[39:49] Come on, Moses. We tried to put the fire
[39:52] in the furnace. It's about all we got.
[39:55] What we need is Holy Spirit fire. The
[39:57] same pillar of fire that led Israel.
[40:00] Sure.
[40:01] Oh, you say, "Now, [clears throat]
[40:03] Brother Brandham, I'd be careful about
[40:05] that." Now wait a minute. When Paul, the
[40:08] great theologian that had plenty of
[40:10] experience, but on the road to Damascus,
[40:12] he was stricken down. He looked up.
[40:15] There was that pillar of fire. He knew
[40:18] that was God. He'd seen it vindicated in
[40:20] the Bible. It was God. Paul called him
[40:22] Lord. Said, "Lord, who are you? What can
[40:25] I do?" He said, "I am Jesus."
[40:30] That settled it. Paul had an absolute.
[40:33] He knew that the God of the Old
[40:34] Testament was Jesus Christ of the New.
[40:37] There he was anchored.
[40:40] Nothing should move him. Sure, he had
[40:43] the vindication. Why? The same pillar of
[40:46] fire that led his people out of Egypt
[40:47] into Israel into Palestine, that same
[40:50] pillar of fire was standing there
[40:52] claiming to be Jesus Christ.
[40:55] Then he knew where he was at. Then he
[40:57] was ready. Soon as he got healed and
[41:00] filled with the Holy Ghost, he was ready
[41:02] to go. See,
[41:04] one more little comment from July 1952.
[41:08] It's the same today. Both new and old
[41:12] testaments, God of the Old Testament was
[41:14] Jesus of the New and the Holy Spirit of
[41:17] today. You know that. Don't you believe
[41:20] that?
[41:23] Let's move on then. How do we reconcile
[41:26] the apparent nature of the God of the
[41:29] Old Testament with the nature of Jesus
[41:33] Christ of the New? For example, God
[41:36] tells Abraham in Genesis chapter 15,
[41:41] "Thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace.
[41:43] Thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
[41:46] But in the fourth generation, they your
[41:49] descendants who will have been in a
[41:51] place where they will have been
[41:52] oppressed shall come hither again. For
[41:55] the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet
[41:58] full.
[42:00] How do we interpret this statement to
[42:02] Abraham? One perspective is that God is
[42:06] saying, "The Amorites aren't quite bad
[42:08] enough for me to have them all killed,
[42:10] but they will be in another few hundred
[42:12] years, and I can't hardly wait to
[42:13] destroy them.
[42:16] Or is it God extending mercy? Abraham,
[42:20] this entire population is really, really
[42:23] evil. But they're part of my creation. I
[42:27] want to extend to them every opportunity
[42:29] to repent and change their ways. I'm a
[42:32] merciful God, not an uncaring tyrant.
[42:35] Let me give them a few hundred more
[42:37] years of mercy while I form your
[42:39] descendants into a nation.
[42:42] Which is more likely given that this is
[42:45] really the spirit of Jesus?
[42:49] When the time passes,
[42:52] Moses is leading the Israelites to the
[42:54] threshold of Canaan. God speaks through
[42:57] Moses to the people. Deuteronomy 9.
[43:01] Speak not thou in thy heart, after that
[43:03] the Lord thy God hath cast them out from
[43:05] before thee, saying, For my
[43:08] righteousness the Lord hath brought me
[43:09] into possess this land. But for the
[43:12] wickedness of these nations, the Lord
[43:14] doth drive them out from before thee.
[43:17] And we know in the Old Testament and in
[43:19] Hebrew, when something is repeated
[43:21] immediately, it's for extra emphasis.
[43:24] And the very next verse, not for thy
[43:27] righteousness, or for the uprightness of
[43:29] thine heart dust thou go to possess
[43:31] their land, but for the wickedness of
[43:34] these nations, the Lord thy God doth
[43:36] drive them out from before thee, and
[43:38] that he may perform the word which the
[43:40] Lord swear unto thy fathers, Abraham,
[43:43] Isaac, and Jacob.
[43:46] This emphatically
[43:48] tells us that God's motive was what?
[43:52] removing evil.
[43:54] If the time gap between Abraham and
[43:56] Moses was to give the Amorites an
[43:58] opportunity to repent and turn to God,
[44:00] you may ask, "Why did he set things up
[44:03] for their destruction?"
[44:05] Some would say, "Well, they were
[44:07] predestinated to be destroyed."
[44:09] Implying they had no choice, no free
[44:12] will, that God created them for the
[44:15] purpose of destroying them.
[44:17] Not so. Again, brother Brandham, now
[44:21] there's a doctrine of predestination
[44:23] which is rotten nonsense. But there
[44:26] really is a true predestination.
[44:29] God by fornowledge could predestinate
[44:32] because he has fornowledge. God's not
[44:35] willing that any should perish. But
[44:38] being the infinite God, he knew who
[44:40] would perish and who would not.
[44:44] So God, as is his nature, was extending
[44:47] mercy, but in his heart, not being
[44:51] constrained by time, but able to look
[44:53] ahead, he knew they would not. So we set
[44:57] things up to limit the evil, not let it
[45:01] spread.
[45:03] If you liken it to an infection, the
[45:05] people Moses were leading were the white
[45:07] blood cells to attack and remove an
[45:09] infection. Except, of course, white
[45:13] blood cells aren't motivated by ethics
[45:15] or concern or love or hate. They're more
[45:20] like robots that just do.
[45:24] What about when there's a motive?
[45:28] Consider
[45:29] one year ago, I found myself in a
[45:33] strange place. I'd never been there
[45:34] before.
[45:36] People took my ID and money, made me sit
[45:38] in a chair in a room with only one way
[45:41] in or out. Soon, a man with a knife
[45:44] approached me.
[45:48] Fortunately, he was a surgeon, and the
[45:51] knife was to remove a cancer from my
[45:53] left ear. His motive was to help me, not
[45:56] harm me, even though he would have to
[45:59] inflict pain in the process. His goal
[46:02] was to remove and destroy the cancer.
[46:05] before it could spread its influence in
[46:07] my body and eventually destroy me.
[46:13] Let's look at another event in the Bible
[46:14] again from the time of Abraham. We'll
[46:17] spend a few minutes on this one because
[46:20] it not only shows an example of
[46:21] containing and limiting evil, it also
[46:25] shows God's mercy and compassion
[46:28] while doing so.
[46:31] a skilled surgeon. God had told Abram to
[46:34] separate himself from his old family.
[46:36] But Abram was still looking after his
[46:38] nephew, Lot. He finally told Lot, "Look,
[46:41] you go one way, I'll go the other. You
[46:44] choose."
[46:45] Genesis 13, we read, "Lot lifted up his
[46:48] eyes and beheld all the plain of Jordan,
[46:51] that it was wellwatered everywhere
[46:54] before the Lord destroyed Sodom and
[46:56] Gomorrah, even as the garden of the
[46:57] Lord, like the land of Egypt, as thou
[47:00] comest unto Zor." Then Lot chose him all
[47:03] the plain of Jordan. And Lot journeyed
[47:06] east. And they, Abram and Lot, separated
[47:10] themselves, the one from the other.
[47:14] Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan. Lot
[47:17] dwelt in the cities of the plain and
[47:19] pitched his tent toward Sodom. But the
[47:22] men of Sodom were wicked and sinners
[47:25] before the Lord exceedingly.
[47:30] Years later,
[47:31] three men came to Abraham and he called
[47:34] them God, my Lord, singular. He served
[47:38] them as we related a few weeks ago. Two
[47:40] of the men then went down the hill to
[47:42] Sodom. Abraham knew the intent was to
[47:45] destroy the place.
[47:48] Abraham was concerned about Lot and
[47:50] asked God if there were a certain number
[47:52] of righteous, would he withhold his hand
[47:54] of judgment? And kind of went back and
[47:55] forth. Eventually, he stopped asking
[47:57] when God said, "If there were 10
[48:00] righteous, he would not destroy."
[48:04] From this within Judaism, there's a
[48:06] tradition to have 10 men pray together
[48:08] called Dominion.
[48:11] But the God of the Old Testament
[48:13] was more merciful
[48:16] than requiring even 10 righteous. Let's
[48:19] read Genesis 19. There came two angels
[48:22] to Sodom at even. Lot sat in the gate of
[48:26] Sodom. And Lot, seeing them, rose up to
[48:28] meet them and bowed himself with his
[48:30] face toward the ground. And Lot said,
[48:32] "Behold now my lords. Turn in, I pray
[48:35] you, into your servants's house, and
[48:37] terry all night, and wash your feet, and
[48:40] you shall rise up early and go on your
[48:42] ways. And they said, "Nay, we'll abide
[48:46] in the street all night."
[48:49] And Lot, knowing this was a very bad
[48:51] idea, pressed upon them greatly. And
[48:54] they turned in unto him, and entered
[48:56] into his house. And he made them a
[48:58] feast, and did bake unleavened bread,
[49:00] and they did eat, very similar to how
[49:03] Abraham had entreated and treated the
[49:05] three that came to him earlier that same
[49:07] day.
[49:08] While at Lots, some locals came to abuse
[49:11] the new arrivals, and the angels
[49:13] supernaturally deterred them. Skipping
[49:15] down to verse 12.
[49:18] And the men, the two angels, said unto
[49:20] Lot, "Hast thou here any besides,
[49:22] son-in-law, thy sons, thy daughters,
[49:25] whosoever thou hast in the city?" In
[49:27] other words, Lot, do you have any other
[49:29] family in this place besides the ones
[49:31] that are in your house? Bring them out
[49:33] of this place, for we will destroy this
[49:36] place, because the cry of them is waxed
[49:38] great before the face of the Lord, and
[49:40] the Lord hath sent us to destroy it."
[49:45] Lot went out, spake to his sons-in-law,
[49:48] which married his daughters, and said,
[49:50] "Up, get you out of this place. The Lord
[49:52] will destroy this city."
[49:55] But he seemed as one that mocked unto
[49:57] his sons-in-law.
[49:59] They and their wives, Lot's own
[50:02] daughters, will remain in the city along
[50:04] with their husbands and and any children
[50:07] they may have had were not told.
[50:10] And when the morning arose, then the
[50:13] angels hastened Lot, saying, "Arise,
[50:16] take thy wife and thy two daughters
[50:18] which are here, lest thou be consumed in
[50:20] the iniquity of the city."
[50:23] And while Lot lingered, we're not told
[50:26] why. Perhaps he was trying to think of a
[50:28] way to rescue his married daughters.
[50:30] Perhaps he had grandchildren in the
[50:32] city. While he delayed, the men laid
[50:35] hold upon his hand the hand of his wife
[50:38] and on the hand of his two daughters.
[50:40] The Lord being merciful to them. Do you
[50:44] see the nature we associate with Jesus
[50:48] and they brought him forth and set him
[50:50] without the city, literally dragged them
[50:52] out.
[50:54] Mrs. Lot looked back again. We're not
[50:56] told why. Perhaps there was a mother's
[50:59] love and concern for her family left
[51:01] behind.
[51:03] But having been specifically told to not
[51:06] look back, she died on the spot. Lot
[51:09] didn't want to travel very far, asking
[51:11] to be released to go into a nearby
[51:13] little city. I don't want to go all the
[51:14] way to that mountain. Just let me go to
[51:16] this little town right here. The angels,
[51:19] probably with reluctance, agreed. They
[51:21] told him hasty. Okay, Lot, hurry up.
[51:26] Escape thither. I cannot do anything
[51:28] till thou become thither.
[51:31] Therefore, the name of the city was
[51:33] called Zoir, which means small.
[51:36] The sun was risen upon the earth when
[51:38] Lot entered Zoir. Then the Lord rained
[51:41] upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah, brimstone
[51:43] and fire from the Lord out of heaven. He
[51:45] overthrew those cities and all the plain
[51:47] and all the inhabitants of the cities
[51:49] which grew upon the ground.
[51:53] He removed
[51:55] the cancer.
[51:58] In his mercy and care for humankind, God
[52:00] excised a cancer which had spread such
[52:02] it infected every person in that area
[52:05] except for Lot, his wife, and his two
[52:09] unmarried daughters. You may be asking,
[52:12] why did God let it get so bad in the
[52:14] first place?
[52:17] I'd have to answer that if if it's the
[52:19] same God that was present in Christ, he
[52:21] was giving the people a chance, time to
[52:24] repent, to be saved. He he did this even
[52:27] to the point of sending Lot there to be
[52:30] a witness to them.
[52:32] We read in second Peter,
[52:37] turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah
[52:39] into ashes, condemned them with an
[52:41] overthrow, making them an example unto
[52:44] those that after should live ungodly.
[52:47] An example. Anybody here ever heard of
[52:49] Sodom and Gomorrah?
[52:52] It wasn't done in a corner, but in part
[52:54] his warning to us.
[52:57] 4,000 years later, we can still learn
[53:00] from this example.
[53:02] And there's more.
[53:04] Peter goes on, "And delivered just Lot
[53:07] vexed with the filthy filthy
[53:09] conversation of the wicked. For that
[53:11] righteous man dwelling among them in
[53:13] seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous
[53:15] soul from day to day with her unwful
[53:17] deeds." Let's unwrap that a little bit.
[53:20] The New King James reads, "And delivered
[53:22] righteous lot, who was oppressed by the
[53:25] filthy conduct of the wicked, for that
[53:27] righteous man dwelling among them
[53:30] tormented his righteous soul from day to
[53:32] day by seeing and hearing their lawless
[53:34] deeds."
[53:36] They had a witness. God sent a witness.
[53:40] I mentioned earlier about the cancer on
[53:42] my ear. Those of us who have been here
[53:45] for a while recall our founding pastor,
[53:48] Brother Perry Green. He also had a
[53:50] cancer on his left ear, but it wasn't
[53:52] detected or treated soon enough. In
[53:55] spite of the best efforts of the
[53:56] surgeons and oncologists and the many
[53:59] prayers for his healing, the cancer
[54:02] spread and eventually took his life.
[54:06] We see a kind of example or parallel of
[54:08] this in the story of Noah.
[54:11] God's extreme patience that by analogy
[54:14] allowed the cancer to spread throughout
[54:16] the body of humanity.
[54:23] Genesis 6 we read, "And God saw that the
[54:27] wickedness of man," note the singular
[54:30] man here means mankind, all of humanity.
[54:33] The wickedness of man was great in the
[54:35] earth, and that every imagination of the
[54:37] thoughts of his all of mankind's what?
[54:41] heart was occasionally.
[54:45] No, only evil how often? Continually.
[54:51] God looks on the heart always. And it
[54:55] repented the Lord that he had made man
[54:57] on the earth and it grieved him at his
[55:00] what? At God's very heart.
[55:04] And the Lord said, "I will destroy man
[55:07] who I have created from the face of the
[55:09] earth, both man and beast, the creeping
[55:11] thing, the fowls of the air. It repents
[55:13] me that I made them." Man was so corrupt
[55:16] that his continued presence even
[55:18] corrupted the animal life around him.
[55:21] But wait, look. In spite of his
[55:24] grieving, the coming judgment, he was
[55:28] still the God of the New Testament.
[55:31] even in the book of Genesis. Why?
[55:34] But Noah found what? Grace in the eyes
[55:39] of the Lord. Grace, the attribute we so
[55:43] often associate with Jesus.
[55:46] These are the generations of Noah. Noah
[55:48] was a just man and perfect in his
[55:50] generations. And Noah walked with God.
[55:55] Noah walked with God.
[55:58] This is also said of one of Noah's
[56:00] ancestors when things were bad but not
[56:02] quite as bad. We we read in the previous
[56:04] chapter Genesis 5, Enoch walked with God
[56:08] just like Noah and he was not for God
[56:12] took him.
[56:14] Same God, same description of his
[56:17] relationship.
[56:19] You can't put God in a box. He's not
[56:23] constrained by our doctrines or our
[56:26] concepts of his nature or ability or or
[56:30] what he might do in a given situation.
[56:33] He's not a tool at our beck and command.
[56:36] He's not a genie in a bottle. He's not
[56:39] there when it's convenient for us to
[56:40] reach into our toolbox and have him
[56:43] serve us or tools in his toolbox to
[56:47] worship and praise and serve him.
[56:52] We've been reading from Genesis and
[56:54] Revelation. We read, "Thou art worthy, O
[56:57] Lord, to receive glory and honor and
[57:00] power for thou hast created all things."
[57:03] Who are we talking about?
[57:06] And for what purpose? For thy pleasure
[57:10] they are and were created.
[57:14] Back to Noah.
[57:17] The earth also was corrupt before God.
[57:19] And the earth was filled filled with
[57:22] violence.
[57:24] God looked upon the earth and behold it
[57:26] was corrupt. For all flesh had corrupted
[57:28] his way upon the earth. And God said
[57:30] unto Noah, "The end of all flesh has
[57:33] come before me. The earth is filled with
[57:36] violence through them. Behold, I will
[57:39] destroy them with the earth."
[57:42] He then tells Noah to build a giant boat
[57:45] in the midst of the plains where he
[57:47] lived.
[57:49] Skipping down to verse 17. "And behold,
[57:52] I, even I, to bring a flood of waters
[57:54] upon the earth to destroy all flesh,
[57:57] wherein is the breath of life from under
[57:58] heaven, and everything that is in the
[58:00] earth shall die. it with thee I will
[58:03] establish my covenant and thou shalt
[58:05] come into the ark, thou and thy sons and
[58:07] thy wife and thy sons wives with thee.
[58:12] And the Lord said unto Noah, "Come thou
[58:14] and all thy house into the ark, for thee
[58:17] have I seen righteous before me in this
[58:20] generation."
[58:22] The entire human race had become violent
[58:26] thoughts continually evil.
[58:30] In Enoch's case, God rescued Enoch from
[58:33] a world going very bad.
[58:36] In Noah's case,
[58:39] I think it's even more special. God not
[58:42] only rescued him, but preserved him and
[58:46] his immediate family in such way as to
[58:48] give humanity a reset,
[58:51] to carry out his plan for the creation
[58:54] and for mankind.
[58:56] Was Noah perfect?
[58:59] Far from it. But Noah found what?
[59:03] Grace,
[59:04] favor in God's sight.
[59:08] Why? When virtually everyone constantly
[59:11] imagined only evil in their hearts, God
[59:15] who looks on the heart. So Noah was the
[59:18] exception.
[59:20] No one except his family accepted his
[59:22] invitation to get on the ark. Second
[59:24] Peter 2:5 tells us Noah was a preacher
[59:26] of righteousness. He was telling people
[59:28] what was going to happen. It took a
[59:30] while to build that boat. And it was a
[59:32] big boat. We got room for you. Come on.
[59:37] When the flood came, Noah couldn't open
[59:40] the door to any who pounded on it,
[59:42] screaming for mercy and rescue. God had
[59:45] closed it. Genesis 7:16 tells us the
[59:48] Lord shut him in.
[59:51] It was then too late for those outside
[59:54] the ark.
[59:56] God didn't just rescue Noah and his
[59:58] family. God rescued the human race.
[1:00:03] We are each one a descendant of Noah.
[1:00:10] Little sidebar. You don't believe the
[1:00:12] story? It's just a myth. It it No, that
[1:00:15] didn't happen.
[1:00:17] Molecular biology studies of
[1:00:19] mitochondrial DNA which comes from the
[1:00:23] female indicates that we are all
[1:00:25] descended from one female ancestor or a
[1:00:28] small group of female ancestors at some
[1:00:30] point in the distant past. The Bible
[1:00:33] calls the female ancestor Eve.
[1:00:37] Similar studies of the Y chromosome,
[1:00:39] which comes only from the male side and
[1:00:42] is passed from father to son, indicate
[1:00:44] that we are all descended from a single
[1:00:46] male ancestor or small group of male
[1:00:48] ancestors which occurred much later in
[1:00:52] human history.
[1:00:54] In other words, our DNA suggests, some
[1:00:59] might say indicates that there was a
[1:01:01] near extinction event in early human
[1:01:03] prehistory
[1:01:05] and only one male survived.
[1:01:08] The Bible calls this the flood and that
[1:01:11] this happened before the great migration
[1:01:13] of humans across the globe.
[1:01:17] The Bible tells us this later common
[1:01:19] male ancestor was Noah.
[1:01:22] These molecular biology studies, by the
[1:01:24] way, are not social media inspired
[1:01:27] speculation,
[1:01:28] but serious academic research. The book
[1:01:32] pictured here has hundreds of footnoted
[1:01:34] references to scientific research
[1:01:36] papers, if that's your thing.
[1:01:40] We could illustrate many other examples
[1:01:42] of the nature of God in the Old
[1:01:44] Testament being the same as the nature
[1:01:45] of Jesus in the New or the realization
[1:01:48] that Jesus did nothing without the
[1:01:50] guidance of the father of the spirit of
[1:01:53] God within him.
[1:01:55] We recognize that the terrible judgment
[1:01:57] and violence we see in the Old Testament
[1:01:59] is a result of evil and its suppression.
[1:02:04] So we must ask
[1:02:06] why allow evil in the first place.
[1:02:13] Why not make man with less propensity to
[1:02:15] do bad things or have swifter swifter
[1:02:17] reckoning?
[1:02:19] Brother Brandham tells us many times
[1:02:21] that for example God had the attribute
[1:02:23] of being a healer. To express that there
[1:02:26] had to be a need for healing likewise
[1:02:29] for salvation and so forth.
[1:02:33] God gave us free will. We spoke last
[1:02:36] time even Cain could have overcome sin
[1:02:40] if he had chosen to do so. God told him
[1:02:43] he could.
[1:02:45] What value is there in forgiveness if
[1:02:48] there's nothing to forgive?
[1:02:51] Let's turn to the Gospel according to
[1:02:53] Luke chapter 7.
[1:02:56] Simon, one of the Pharisees, desired
[1:02:59] Jesus that he would eat with him.
[1:03:01] Jesus went into the Pharisees house and
[1:03:03] sat down to meet.
[1:03:06] And behold, a woman in the city, which
[1:03:09] was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus
[1:03:11] sat at meat in the Pharisees house,
[1:03:14] brought an alabaster box of ointment,
[1:03:17] and stood at Jesus' feet behind him
[1:03:19] weeping, and began to wash his feet with
[1:03:22] tears, and did wipe them with the hairs
[1:03:24] of her head, and kissed his feet, and
[1:03:26] anointed them with the ointment.
[1:03:32] A few years ago, someone in the church
[1:03:34] asked me how this was possible. If Jesus
[1:03:38] sat at a table eating, how could a woman
[1:03:40] stand behind him and wash his feet?
[1:03:44] In the summer of 2022, Heather and I
[1:03:46] went to England and visited the British
[1:03:48] Museum. I saw this statue from the Roman
[1:03:51] era and took a picture to show how a
[1:03:54] person might sit at meat while someone
[1:03:56] could then stand behind the diner and
[1:03:59] wash his feet.
[1:04:01] Context is so important. The meaning of
[1:04:04] words not always what comes to our minds
[1:04:07] when we read. Sat at meat we think of a
[1:04:10] table a chair. In this case it means
[1:04:13] reclined to eat a meal.
[1:04:16] Now when the Pharisee who had bidden
[1:04:19] Jesus saw it, he spake out loud to the
[1:04:21] fellow next to him, no Simon spoke
[1:04:25] within himself, saying, "This man, if he
[1:04:29] were a prophet, he would have known who
[1:04:31] and what manner of woman this is that
[1:04:33] touches him, for she's a sinner."
[1:04:36] And Jesus answering
[1:04:39] said unto him,"Simon,
[1:04:41] I have somewhat to say unto thee." And
[1:04:44] Simon said, "Master," meaning teacher,
[1:04:47] "Say on." And Jesus said to Simon, there
[1:04:51] was a certain creditor, had two debtors.
[1:04:55] Simon, one owed him 500 p, 500 bucks,
[1:05:00] 500,000, 500 somethings, and the other
[1:05:04] 50, only a tenth. When they had nothing
[1:05:08] to pay, he frankly forgave them both.
[1:05:12] Tell me therefore which of them will
[1:05:15] love him most.
[1:05:19] And Simon answered and said, I suppose
[1:05:21] that he to whom he forgave most. Jesus
[1:05:25] said unto him,
[1:05:27] Yeah, you got it. Das rightly judged.
[1:05:31] And Jesus turned to the woman, but said
[1:05:34] to Simon,
[1:05:36] "Do you see this woman?
[1:05:38] I entered into your house. You gave me
[1:05:41] no water for my feet, but she's washed
[1:05:43] my feet with tears, wiped them with the
[1:05:46] hairs of her head. Thou gavest me no
[1:05:49] kiss, but this woman since the time I
[1:05:51] came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet,
[1:05:54] my head with oil, thou did not anoint,
[1:05:57] but this woman hath anointed my feet
[1:05:59] with ointment.
[1:06:01] Wherefore I say unto thee, Simon, her
[1:06:04] sins which are many are forgiven, for
[1:06:08] she loved much, but to whom little is
[1:06:11] forgiven, the same loveth little.
[1:06:15] And Jesus said unto her,
[1:06:18] Thy sins are forgiven. What
[1:06:22] they that sat meet with him began to say
[1:06:25] within themselves, who is this that
[1:06:27] forgives sins also? That's the right
[1:06:30] question
[1:06:32] and it's right to ask that question.
[1:06:36] Jesus said to the woman, "Thy faith has
[1:06:39] saved thee. Go in peace."
[1:06:42] Who can forgive sins?
[1:06:45] The people there knew exactly the
[1:06:47] answer. Only Jehovah God of the Old
[1:06:51] Testament.
[1:06:52] There was an entire ritual or process
[1:06:54] for a person to make a sin offering. The
[1:06:57] priest who offered the sacrifice on
[1:06:59] behalf of the petitioner did not have
[1:07:01] the power to forgive only to perform the
[1:07:04] sacrifice.
[1:07:06] There was an annual offering for the
[1:07:08] community on yum kipur the day of
[1:07:10] atonement.
[1:07:12] But this was all in order that God would
[1:07:14] forgive or cover their sins.
[1:07:18] So who was this Jesus who forgave sins?
[1:07:22] Paul tells us in Philippians, "Let this
[1:07:25] mind be in you, which was also in Christ
[1:07:29] Jesus, who being in the form of God,
[1:07:33] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:07:37] God."
[1:07:40] For our closing scriptures, I I'd like
[1:07:42] to read the testimony of the first
[1:07:44] person recorded in the New Testament to
[1:07:47] recognize and state that Jehovah God of
[1:07:51] the Old Testament was Jesus Christ of
[1:07:53] the New Testament. The first one to
[1:07:55] declare Jesus was in fact God.
[1:08:00] Wasn't Paul,
[1:08:02] wasn't Peter. Peter called Jesus the
[1:08:04] anointed, but didn't call him God.
[1:08:08] Who did?
[1:08:10] Well, let's read. The context is Jesus
[1:08:13] appearing to his disciples after his
[1:08:15] resurrection and before his ascension.
[1:08:18] Let's turn to the Gospel of John,
[1:08:19] chapter 20, starting at verse 24.
[1:08:24] But Thomas, one of the 12 called
[1:08:27] Ditimus.
[1:08:28] Little sidebar. I always find that
[1:08:30] curious. Ditimus means twin. Does that
[1:08:33] mean he had a twin brother? Sometimes I
[1:08:35] wonder if he wasn't just a dead ringer
[1:08:37] for Jesus. If he wasn't just a lookalike
[1:08:39] and so they called him the twin.
[1:08:42] That's just my own personal speculation.
[1:08:46] Thomas was not with them when Jesus
[1:08:48] came. The other disciples therefore said
[1:08:51] to Thomas, "Thomas, we've seen the
[1:08:54] Lord."
[1:08:56] Thomas said unto them,
[1:08:59] "Except I shall see in his hands the
[1:09:01] print of the nails and put my finger in
[1:09:03] the print of the nails and thrust my
[1:09:05] hand to his side, I don't believe you
[1:09:07] guys. You You just were imagining it.
[1:09:10] You're hallucinating or something." No.
[1:09:13] After eight days again, Jesus disciples
[1:09:16] were within that. They're hiding, right?
[1:09:19] They're afraid of things at that point.
[1:09:21] And Thomas with them. Then came Jesus.
[1:09:25] the doors being shut and stood in the
[1:09:27] midst and said, "Peace be unto you."
[1:09:30] Then saith he,
[1:09:33] who? Jesus, to Thomas, "Reach hither thy
[1:09:38] finger, and behold my hands. Reach
[1:09:40] hither thy hand, and thrust it into my
[1:09:42] side. Be not faithless, but believing."
[1:09:46] And Thomas answered and said unto him,
[1:09:50] "My Lord and my God.
[1:09:55] Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because
[1:09:59] thou hast seen me, thou hast believed.
[1:10:02] Blessed are they that have not seen and
[1:10:05] yet have believed.
[1:10:07] Anybody here? Yeah. Yeah.
[1:10:12] The worship team would please come.
[1:10:16] In addition to these scriptures we've
[1:10:18] read tonight, we also know that Jesus
[1:10:21] will sit in judgment. We read some of
[1:10:23] those scriptures last time. The nature
[1:10:26] of God has not changed. From Genesis 1:1
[1:10:29] through Revelation 22:21,
[1:10:32] he's the same. He's consistent. I'll let
[1:10:36] brother Brandon summarize.
[1:10:40] He says, "Man lost his origin and he
[1:10:44] back there and fell from grace. And when
[1:10:46] he did that, God came down and was made
[1:10:48] in the image of man to redeem man back
[1:10:51] to God. God was in Christ reconciling
[1:10:55] the world to himself. And the God of the
[1:10:58] Old Testament, Jesus Christ of the New,
[1:11:00] and the Holy Spirit of this day, is the
[1:11:03] same Jehovah God living down through the
[1:11:06] age.
[1:11:07] It's the same grace we read about in
[1:11:10] Noah's day that's extended to us today
[1:11:13] through the cross of Calvary. I often
[1:11:16] think of the verse of Hebrews 13:8,
[1:11:19] Jesus Christ. The same yesterday,
[1:11:23] Adam's day, Abraham's day, Noah's day,
[1:11:26] Moses day, Paul's day, and today,
[1:11:30] November the 5th, 2025,
[1:11:34] and forever,
[1:11:35] reliable, dependable,
[1:11:38] always there.
[1:11:41] As we pass the service over to our
[1:11:43] pastor,
[1:11:45] Let's stand if you would and worship and
[1:11:49] we'll sing.
[1:11:52] Brother Aaron,
[1:12:00] we're going to sing down from His Glory.
[1:12:04] Let me let me just read some of the
[1:12:05] words here as we prepare to sing. Down
[1:12:07] from His Glory, ever living story.
[1:12:10] Who my God and Savior came? Jesus was
[1:12:13] his name. Born in a manger to his own
[1:12:16] estranger,
[1:12:18] a man of sorrows, tears, and agony. What
[1:12:22] condescension,
[1:12:23] bringing us redemption, that in the dead
[1:12:26] of night, not one fate, hope in sight.
[1:12:28] God gracious, tender, laid aside his
[1:12:33] splendor, stooping to woo, to win, to
[1:12:36] save my soul. Without reluctance, flesh
[1:12:40] and blood as substance, he took the form
