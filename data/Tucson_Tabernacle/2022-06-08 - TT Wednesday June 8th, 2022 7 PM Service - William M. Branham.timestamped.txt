[37:25] i believe that the sun had already come
[37:27] up
[37:29] and was bathing across the
[37:31] galilean skies drawing up the fragrance
[37:34] of the roses where the night
[37:37] had been quite
[37:39] and sweetness comes on the air
[37:43] and she was making her way down along
[37:45] the side of the street to the city
[37:48] well where the people come together
[37:50] their supply of water
[37:53] and as she made her way along with a
[37:56] little a crock under her
[37:58] arm
[38:00] she was studying thinking
[38:02] about
[38:04] the day before and the great mighty
[38:07] message that the rabbi had preached
[38:11] and at this
[38:12] message that she and joseph her engaged
[38:15] husband had of
[38:17] on their front porch after the
[38:20] midday meal
[38:23] as they sat there
[38:24] looking across the little hill
[38:27] to where finally
[38:29] the little house would be erected where
[38:31] they were to spend their
[38:33] life
[38:34] as far as they knew in this little
[38:36] building
[38:37] joseph was a carpenter
[38:41] and he loved his job and he loved to do
[38:44] things just right
[38:46] and being a believer in god and know
[38:49] that there was someone who watched over
[38:51] him
[38:52] he wanted all of his work to be just
[38:54] exactly right
[38:57] but all this little house was a special
[39:01] one
[39:02] the doors had to be just perfect and the
[39:05] closets in it because he was bringing
[39:09] the sweetest woman in all the world
[39:12] there to be his bride
[39:16] as a as a custom would sit out there and
[39:19] look at the little house and plant just
[39:22] how the roses would be at this little
[39:24] spot
[39:25] and the gate must be a little heart
[39:27] because they were so in love and how
[39:29] they were planning on doing it because
[39:32] joseph being the carpenter while he
[39:34] could take his time
[39:37] and then perhaps just behind the house
[39:40] that was going to be the carpenter's
[39:42] shop
[39:42] where he would do all this cabinet work
[39:44] to make his doors and and the little
[39:47] odds and ends that was brought to him
[39:49] and in that they would have their
[39:51] livelihood
[39:54] and this sunday as soon as they had come
[39:56] out of sabbath and set on the front
[40:00] porch
[40:01] after the
[40:03] midday meal
[40:06] it must have been joseph that said that
[40:08] was a striking message this morning
[40:10] mary
[40:12] i am so thrilled when i hear our rabbi
[40:16] speak of the greatness of jehovah
[40:20] and all how he told us of that
[40:23] great mighty god that came down into
[40:26] egypt and took our people out
[40:30] how he opened up the red sea when it got
[40:33] in his way
[40:35] and how he rained bred out of heaven
[40:38] blow the quails and out of field
[40:40] led them by a pillar of fire
[40:43] by night and a cloud by day
[40:47] how the children of israel camped under
[40:50] this great light as they walked in the
[40:52] light
[40:54] wherever it went they went also and
[40:56] brought them safely into the promised
[40:59] land
[41:01] and there he might have said something
[41:03] like this yes darling
[41:06] but i want to ask you something
[41:10] what happened to that great god
[41:13] that he isn't just as great today as he
[41:15] was then
[41:18] did you notice a rabbi answer that
[41:20] wonderful message
[41:22] then alas he said
[41:24] jehovah must have turned his back on us
[41:26] because
[41:28] he doesn't perform miracles anymore
[41:32] but joseph quickly picked it up and said
[41:35] but mary
[41:37] i believe that god is just as great and
[41:40] powerful as he ever was
[41:44] i found that
[41:46] mary's mother anna must have come to the
[41:49] door and said are you young folks
[41:52] waiting for the scriptures
[41:54] and handed him to the hand of mary
[41:58] which passed it on to joseph the book of
[42:00] isaiah
[42:02] joseph opening up the scroll begin to
[42:04] read
[42:05] and when he come to isaiah 9 6
[42:10] unto us a child is born
[42:13] unto us our son is given
[42:16] and his the government shall be upon his
[42:19] shoulders
[42:20] his name shall be called counselor
[42:23] prince of peace mighty god everlasting
[42:26] father
[42:28] and of his peace and his kingdom there
[42:31] shall be no end
[42:35] and it must have been that time that
[42:37] mary's heart was strangely worn
[42:41] isn't it strange how god does things
[42:44] scriptures made manifest
[42:47] she said
[42:49] joseph
[42:51] and he looked at her and perhaps he
[42:54] always thought she was the most
[42:56] beautiful woman he'd ever saw
[42:59] but then there was a certain look in her
[43:02] face that charmed him more than ever
[43:05] while her pretty eyes looked at him like
[43:09] that of the dove soft
[43:11] innocent
[43:13] i think that's the way a woman should
[43:14] look
[43:16] innocent soft and sweet
[43:19] she said
[43:20] joseph
[43:20] [Music]
[43:21] what was the prophet speaking of when he
[43:24] said
[43:25] unto us
[43:26] a child is born and unto us a son is
[43:29] given who is this son and this child
[43:34] that he was speaking on
[43:37] joseph
[43:38] looked back to her must have been said
[43:41] well my dear the prophet was speaking of
[43:44] the coming messiah
[43:48] the hope of israel
[43:51] and you know mary that all
[43:53] down to the ages since moses we've
[43:57] looked forward to that one coming
[44:00] and when he comes he will deliver us our
[44:03] bondage of these romans
[44:06] out of the bondage of our sins
[44:09] and israel will know their god
[44:13] and he'll keep his word and mary my dear
[44:17] if we don't see him in our generation
[44:20] he'll surely be here in the next
[44:24] but we'll look for him in our generation
[44:29] all night she couldn't sleep over
[44:32] unto us a child is born
[44:36] under us a son is given
[44:40] and the next morning she slept late so
[44:42] she was late getting to the well
[44:44] that's why the sun was up
[44:47] and as she made her way down the street
[44:49] seemed like no one
[44:51] was around
[44:54] and
[44:56] she was thinking on this scripture
[45:00] and it's usually when we're thanking
[45:07] [Music]
[45:11] is because their thoughts are on other
[45:14] things
[45:15] let the meditation in my mind my heart
[45:17] be acceptable unto thee oh lord
[45:21] i believe if we'll think on him he'll
[45:24] draw nigh unto us
[45:27] remember the first easter
[45:29] when
[45:30] the orpheus and his
[45:32] unnamed friend in the bible was on their
[45:34] road to emmaus
[45:36] they were going along the road
[45:38] discussing about him
[45:40] thinking of him
[45:42] all their hearts were burned
[45:45] every hope seemed like that they had was
[45:47] taken from them and it was dan that a
[45:49] stranger
[45:51] walked out inside the bush and walked
[45:54] with them
[45:55] they didn't know who it was
[45:57] you're just a man come walking out
[45:59] walked along them and said why are you
[46:01] so weary
[46:03] why are you so faint in your mind
[46:05] and they said are you just a stranger
[46:08] nor astound not that jesus of nazareth
[46:11] who we hope to be the deliverer of
[46:12] israel has been crucified by pilate and
[46:16] this is the third day
[46:18] some women said they've seen it visit
[46:20] angels
[46:21] and then he started from the scriptures
[46:23] and began to explain to them the
[46:26] scriptures house christ must suffer and
[46:28] enter into his glory
[46:31] and then when he got them in the room
[46:33] and closed the doors and he did a
[46:35] miracle or something just like he did
[46:38] before his crucifixion and they knew it
[46:40] was him thinking on him
[46:43] oh if we didn't have so many other
[46:46] things on our mind
[46:48] you know sometimes we'll come to church
[46:50] think about tomorrow i gotta do this the
[46:52] next day i've got to do this
[46:54] when we come to church we ought to lay
[46:56] aside every thought and everything of
[46:59] the world and enter into fellowship with
[47:02] christ and
[47:04] worship
[47:06] meditating
[47:08] worshiping in our hearts and giving
[47:10] songs and praises to him
[47:14] thanking all his goodness
[47:16] and what he means to us
[47:18] worshiping in the spirit
[47:20] singing spiritual songs making melodies
[47:23] in our heart
[47:25] even the bible says there's any
[47:26] afflicted let them sing psalms
[47:29] be happy
[47:31] be in meditation always expecting god at
[47:34] any moment to appear to you
[47:37] are you doing it just now before this
[47:39] healing service you people stop prayer
[47:41] cards waiting for the line are you
[47:43] thinking it's just a few more minutes
[47:47] and all my suffering will be over
[47:50] are you thinking oh i don't know he
[47:51] might not call my card it might be oh
[47:54] don't do that just remember just keep it
[47:56] on your mind it just be a few minutes
[47:58] now and you'll meet the requirements
[48:01] that god said do
[48:03] these signs shall follow them that
[48:05] belief if they lay their hands on the
[48:07] sick they shall recover
[48:11] keeping on your mind
[48:13] and she was thanking all the scriptures
[48:16] that scripture was being confirmed to
[48:19] her a child is born a son is given
[48:24] about that time she's seen something
[48:26] flash before the little virgin
[48:28] and a light
[48:30] no doubt my mind like the pillar of fire
[48:33] and standing there was a angel
[48:37] the mighty gabriel
[48:40] he's a messenger to the jews
[48:42] remember gabriel announced the first
[48:44] coming of christ the angel gabriel will
[48:47] announce the second coming of christ
[48:49] the bible said so
[48:52] now
[48:53] there it frightened the little lady
[48:56] and she looked at him and
[48:58] he said
[48:59] hail
[49:00] mary blessed art thou among the women
[49:05] god highly favored of god
[49:08] for god is with thee
[49:13] and he told what was going to happen
[49:15] that she was going to bear a child and
[49:18] they should call his name jesus for it
[49:21] save the people from the sins
[49:24] now she had a right to know that that
[49:26] was the right kind of a messenger
[49:28] first thing he was an angel standing
[49:30] there the next thing he told her who she
[49:31] was mary
[49:33] you know that was a sign of god down to
[49:35] the age
[49:37] she looked at him and she said how can
[49:40] these things be seen that i don't know a
[49:42] man and he said the
[49:45] holy ghost shall come upon me
[49:49] before miracles can take place the holy
[49:51] ghost has to come
[49:54] that's what's the matter in the world
[49:56] today they're denying the power of the
[49:58] holy ghost
[49:59] that's why
[50:01] people can't believe in divine healing
[50:02] they're denying the very holy spirit
[50:05] that brings divine healing
[50:08] the holy ghost shall come upon me and
[50:10] the most high shall overshadow thee and
[50:13] that holy thing which shall be born of
[50:16] thee shall be called the son of god
[50:21] that's how he's coming you don't need to
[50:22] know no man god's going to do this
[50:26] or with god nothing is impossible
[50:31] or what that little lady had to believe
[50:34] she had to believe something that was
[50:36] impossible
[50:38] she had to believe something had never
[50:40] happened
[50:41] heger hannah
[50:43] when she was told by the priest the lord
[50:45] gives me thy desire
[50:48] while she went home in nine months
[50:49] brought the child
[50:51] that was wonderful
[50:53] but and so was elizabeth as he said thy
[50:57] cousin elizabeth
[50:58] which was called baron
[51:01] is already six months to be mother
[51:06] and told her that with god nothing was
[51:08] impossible
[51:10] and she said
[51:11] behold the hands made out of the lord
[51:15] be it unto me according to thy word
[51:20] what you had to believe something had
[51:22] never happened
[51:24] zacharias the priest the husband of her
[51:26] cousin he doubted that same angel when
[51:29] he said after the days of administration
[51:31] at the temple
[51:32] he would go home and live with his wife
[51:35] elizabeth
[51:36] and she'd bring a son and he said i'm
[51:38] too old it can't be done
[51:40] oh he just doubted it
[51:42] and he had abraham and sarah to look at
[51:44] he had hannah at the temple and eli her
[51:47] husband to think of
[51:49] but that callous
[51:51] priest doubted god's word
[51:56] but his brother cicarian said the other
[51:59] day over in the island when i saw my
[52:02] mother-in-law died
[52:04] five days before it happened
[52:06] and my brother-in-law have a hemorrhage
[52:08] and blood out from his mouth just poured
[52:10] it from his mouth
[52:12] brother simon said let us go in and pray
[52:15] that this won't happen i said it won't
[52:16] do one bit of good
[52:19] god has already said it it's got to
[52:22] happen
[52:25] god when he says anything it's
[52:26] impossible for it not to happen
[52:29] therefore when god says in the books all
[52:33] things are possible to them that believe
[52:35] it's got to happen
[52:39] no way to explain it away
[52:41] you can believe god will perform every
[52:44] promise that he made
[52:47] then
[52:50] when she
[52:51] never waited little mary didn't now she
[52:54] had to believe something that had never
[52:56] happened
[52:57] but look at her little childish heart
[52:59] i'm going to thank her to be just a
[53:01] young woman about 18 20 years old
[53:04] she never taken the second thought
[53:07] as soon as she's seen and know that was
[53:09] the angel of the lord
[53:11] that knowed these things and told her
[53:14] exactly according to scripture she had
[53:16] been thinking on and told her her name
[53:21] she know that messenger come from god
[53:25] and the scripture that she had been
[53:27] thinking on was confirmed right there to
[53:29] her
[53:30] mary
[53:33] the holy ghost will come upon you
[53:37] and if almighty shall overshadow thee
[53:40] and that holy thing that'll be born will
[53:43] not be a man but he'll be called the son
[53:46] of god
[53:47] she threw her little hands up in the
[53:49] tears running out of those beautiful
[53:51] eyes said hold the hands made of the
[53:54] lord
[53:55] bid unto me according to thy word
[53:58] she didn't wait till she was positive of
[54:00] this
[54:01] she didn't wait till she felt life
[54:03] or some kind of a sensation to prove
[54:05] that she was to be a mother
[54:07] she just took his word and that was
[54:09] enough
[54:11] that's what god wants you to do tonight
[54:13] not wait till you feel better not wait
[54:15] for you to move your hand better walk a
[54:17] good step not wait till the doctor says
[54:19] you're improving but take god at his
[54:21] word and begin to believe
[54:24] that's the only way to please him take
[54:26] his word
[54:27] that's the way miracles are performed
[54:29] when god is tucked by his word the
[54:31] impossibles are made real when god is
[54:33] stuck at his word not question
[54:36] just keep it from your mind
[54:39] behold the hands made of the lord while
[54:41] she was so happy about it she just
[54:43] couldn't stand still and nothing had
[54:45] showed up yet
[54:47] but she knew it was going to because god
[54:49] said
[54:52] if christ says these signs shall power
[54:55] them that believe if they lay their
[54:56] hands on the sick they shall recover
[55:00] take him at his word
[55:01] don't doubt anything just go right on
[55:03] believing
[55:05] it'll be all right
[55:06] god promised it god will perform it god
[55:09] watches over his words to keep it
[55:11] and to answer prayer
[55:14] then
[55:15] she started on her way she heard good
[55:17] news
[55:18] of her cousin elizabeth
[55:20] an old woman
[55:21] around 65 70 years old her husband the
[55:25] same age
[55:26] around 70 or 75 years old and she had
[55:29] conceived in her old age because she had
[55:32] believed god would give her a child
[55:37] it was an honor then to have a baby
[55:40] it's a dishonor now
[55:43] they'd rather buy a little dog give it
[55:45] the love of a child no wonder we got
[55:48] juvenile delinquency we got dog loving
[55:50] mothers
[55:51] that's
[55:52] oh it's a shame
[55:55] but
[55:56] it was a honor then and a dishonor for a
[55:59] woman not to have a baby
[56:01] but
[56:02] lil and mary takes out up in the from
[56:04] nazareth up into the hills of judea up
[56:07] over that rough path
[56:09] i guess further or invite you
[56:11] travel that path a few weeks ago
[56:14] up over that hill into judea to meet her
[56:16] cousin to enjoy his fellowship together
[56:20] because god had overshadowed both of
[56:23] them
[56:25] what a privilege it is for brethren to
[56:27] dwell together in unity it's like the
[56:30] anointing oil it was on aaron's beard
[56:32] that run all the way to the hymns of his
[56:34] church
[56:35] when people together can agree upon god
[56:39] still being god god just as great as he
[56:41] ever was and can assemble themselves
[56:43] together and worship god in spirit
[56:46] mary wanted fellowship no need of going
[56:48] down to the synagogue because they
[56:50] didn't believe it she went to somebody
[56:52] that had an experience like she had
[56:54] and she went there to fellowship
[56:57] so on her way she went to somebody that
[57:00] believed god was still just as great as
[57:02] he ever was
[57:03] yes
[57:04] that's why we're having this christian
[57:06] businessman fellowship in the morning
[57:08] where businessmen can worship together
[57:10] on one common ground
[57:12] believing that jesus christ is the same
[57:15] yesterday today and forever that's why
[57:17] we got churches around over this city
[57:19] and around all the world that's
[57:20] preaching the unsearchable riches of
[57:22] christ
[57:24] because we have fellowship together
[57:26] we set in heavenly places in christ
[57:28] jesus the holy ghost coming up on us and
[57:30] overshadowing us empowering us with
[57:32] gifts and signs and wonders and miracles
[57:35] why it's some closest thing to heaven
[57:37] there is
[57:38] on the earth
[57:40] there she took out for this fellowship
[57:42] the heart calls for it
[57:45] up over the hills i can see her going
[57:47] her little cheeks of blessing them
[57:49] little eyes sparkling
[57:51] as she fell out keep this a secret from
[57:53] joseph i just can't wait out doc to go
[57:56] and up in the hill she went on up into
[57:59] judea
[58:01] up at the house of her cousin and mary
[58:04] before she got to the house
[58:07] elizabeth her cousin had hid herself
[58:10] because he was very weary
[58:13] because little john in the wombs of his
[58:16] mother
[58:17] was six months and no life had showed
[58:20] yet
[58:20] now that's all together
[58:23] on unnatural
[58:25] it isn't just exactly the regular
[58:27] routine
[58:28] life appears in three or four months and
[58:30] this is six months
[58:32] and she was a little weary about it i
[58:34] can see her sitting back in a room
[58:37] and there she said praying something
[58:39] like this
[58:40] god
[58:41] i waited all these years
[58:44] and i believed in my heart that
[58:47] something was about to happen
[58:49] there sets my husband out there
[58:51] dumb he can't speak he keeps writing on
[58:54] a satan saying i saw an angel i saw an
[58:58] angel an angel spoke to me at the right
[59:00] hand of the altar something great's
[59:02] going to happen and all of a sudden
[59:05] she's seen that she was to be mother but
[59:08] she the baby grew but had no life no
[59:11] muscles are moving at all
[59:13] six months

[1:02:40] branham the duchess wants to see you i
[1:02:43] said the what
[1:02:45] said the duchess
[1:02:47] i said i don't know what you're talking
[1:02:49] about
[1:02:50] and he said well it's a great woman
[1:02:52] she's the duchess
[1:02:54] and said she's right back behind the
[1:02:56] temperature i said well why she heard
[1:02:58] what about all these sick people laying
[1:03:00] out here
[1:03:01] and she's they said oh but she owns this
[1:03:03] whole thing through here i said
[1:03:06] my father owns all this whole thing
[1:03:08] across years
[1:03:09] i said
[1:03:10] why i see her
[1:03:12] i said that's his children laying out
[1:03:14] there sick and he sent me here to pray
[1:03:15] for them if i can see anybody let me see
[1:03:18] them
[1:03:19] so when i went out they had a woman
[1:03:21] standing there whether you said so or
[1:03:23] not great big woman had enough diamonds
[1:03:26] on her hand to send the missionaries
[1:03:28] around the world 50 times you never seen
[1:03:30] so much gold and stuff and a woman had a
[1:03:32] a glass in her hand had it had specks on
[1:03:35] the end of them or sticks she held out
[1:03:37] like this look down here uh you know
[1:03:39] that any common sense should tell you
[1:03:41] you're not going to keep your ass out
[1:03:42] like that holding out like that
[1:03:46] and she said

[1:03:54] dr brandon if i knew that i said no
[1:03:56] ma'am my brother random the servant of
[1:03:58] christ
[1:03:59] and she said well i am chomped or
[1:04:01] delighted or something like that with
[1:04:02] her hand up like this i looked at her a
[1:04:04] little bit i thought that's the funniest
[1:04:06] we don't shake hands like that in
[1:04:07] kentucky so i
[1:04:09] uh seen she wanted to shake hands with
[1:04:10] me so i reached up and got over here i
[1:04:12] said well get it down here so i know you
[1:04:14] when i see you again
[1:04:18] what is it it's somebody trying to act
[1:04:20] something that they're not
[1:04:22] that's just exactly it's a lot of
[1:04:25] putt-on that has no meaning to it at all
[1:04:27] she was no more than six foot of dirt
[1:04:29] like the rest of us that's just exactly
[1:04:31] him
[1:04:32] but trying to be something easy like old
[1:04:35] congressman upshaw that was sealed in a
[1:04:37] meeting after being in a wheelchair and
[1:04:39] crutches for 66 years he always had a
[1:04:42] little slogan he said you can't be
[1:04:44] nothing that you hate
[1:04:46] and that's really the truth that's it
[1:04:48] you can't be
[1:04:49] all people now you know you don't even
[1:04:51] know when your your neighbor dies like
[1:04:53] you see it in the paper anymore they
[1:04:55] don't have no more fellowship like we
[1:04:56] used to have we're going down the street
[1:04:58] 90 miles an hour and turn the corners
[1:05:00] stop and talk for an hour before you go
[1:05:02] home
[1:05:02] or there's something insane about the
[1:05:05] whole thing
[1:05:06] but people in them they love one another
[1:05:10] they had time fellowship
[1:05:12] and to talk to each other and elizabeth
[1:05:15] salt her cousin and she run out into her
[1:05:19] arms around her and begin to hug her she
[1:05:21] said oh mary while the last time i've

[1:08:13] spirit

[1:08:38] amazing
[1:08:40] inscribable name of the lord jesus
[1:08:44] one time i give it a challenge

[1:08:50] when i was in france i went to pig alley
[1:08:52] i didn't take anybody's word but i want
[1:08:53] to see it myself

[1:08:56] took a couple of fellows and went up in
[1:08:58] indiana where they had that big meeting
[1:09:00] of spiritualism i suppose the hopes that
[1:09:02] they were
[1:09:03] now i went in there and they had a table
[1:09:05] standing up and said no man can knock
[1:09:07] that table down going all like that the
[1:09:09] people were
[1:09:10] going on all kinds of demon powers
[1:09:13] and they looked over there and
[1:09:16] i said the power of god can knock that
[1:09:18] table down and i said
[1:09:21] they wouldn't believe it and they were
[1:09:23] trying to hold it down with hands for
[1:09:25] man with their legs wrapped around
[1:09:26] trying to pull it down and this woman
[1:09:28] standing there doing all kinds of things
[1:09:30] and making that table walk do around

[1:09:42] holy church fall it didn't do it i

[1:10:04] the wombs of its mother and leap for joy
[1:10:07] and the bible said that john was born
[1:10:09] from his mother's womb full of the holy
[1:10:11] ghost

[1:10:14] womb in the holy ghost upon him

[1:11:30] in such a way that my human senses
[1:11:33] will not function unless it's in the
[1:11:35] will of god
[1:11:36] i want to be led by the spirit the
[1:11:40] spirit is the sixth sense
[1:11:42] god gave man five senses
[1:11:44] they wasn't to control you their
[1:11:47] contacts are earthly homes
[1:11:49] but the sixth sense which is faith it
[1:11:51] leads you
[1:11:52] it controls you
[1:11:54] our heavenly father
[1:11:57] oh how good it is to talk of the lord
[1:11:59] jesus
[1:12:00] to see how it blesses our soul and
[1:12:03] to know tonight that there never was a
[1:12:06] man barnes under the heavens like that
[1:12:10] that never was such a wonderful gift
[1:12:12] ever given to the world when god so
[1:12:14] loved the world that he gave his only
[1:12:16] begotten son
[1:12:18] whosoever believeth on him should not
[1:12:20] perish but has eternal life
[1:12:23] all that god has done for the human race
[1:12:25] and we set and rehearse that over in the
[1:12:28] experiences of other people in days gone
[1:12:31] by who has been in contact with heaven
[1:12:34] through the messengers of angels and the
[1:12:36] lord jesus the holy spirit and god
[1:12:39] himself
[1:12:42] oh lord as we
[1:12:44] fellowship around these things and know
[1:12:47] that it's not some kind of a story

[1:12:58] he's here tonight just as real as he was
[1:13:02] in galilee he cannot fail his name has
[1:13:06] been given above every name in heavens
[1:13:09] and earth all the family is named jesus
[1:13:13] all the powers in the heavens and earth
[1:13:15] is given into his hands and he says go
[1:13:17] preach the gospel these signs shall
[1:13:20] follow in that belief
[1:13:22] night after night as he showed us here
[1:13:25] that he was the same god who came down
[1:13:27] and created himself a body and talked to
[1:13:30] abraham and done a sign of knowing that
[1:13:34] he had a wife and her name was sarah and
[1:13:36] know that she laughed in the tent behind
[1:13:38] him
[1:13:40] that body was nothing but dirt
[1:13:42] dust and cosmic light and petroleum

[1:13:47] come from when he got finished with it
[1:13:49] stole our body

[1:17:25] who art in heaven
[1:17:27] hallowed be thy name
[1:17:29] thy kingdom come
[1:17:31] thine will be done
[1:17:34] on earth as it is in heaven
[1:17:37] give us this day our daily bread
[1:17:40] and forgive us of our trespasses as we
[1:17:44] forgive those that trespass against us
[1:17:48] and lead us not into temptation
[1:17:51] but deliver us from evil
[1:17:53] for thine is the kingdom and the power
[1:17:57] and the glory forever
[1:18:00] amen
[1:18:02] jesus said when you pray that
[1:18:05] if you have ought in your heart forgive
[1:18:07] every man from your heart his trespass
[1:18:10] or if you do not from your heart forgive
[1:18:12] every trespass that mine has done
[1:18:15] against you neither does your heavenly
[1:18:17] father forgive you yours so to enter
[1:18:19] this line be free from sin confess your
[1:18:23] faults one to another pray one for
[1:18:25] another that you may be healed i'm going
[1:18:27] to ask our brother now what i call the
[1:18:29] prayer line
[1:18:30] i want to call him just one by one so
[1:18:32] that you won't make this a terrible
[1:18:35] condition and how many here that has
[1:18:38] prayer card now raise up your hands just
[1:18:40] come across a scene
[1:18:45] and he landed in another country and a
[1:18:47] little woman come along
[1:18:49] without any prestige anyone to bring her
[1:18:52] many years she'd had a flooding and
[1:18:55] a blood issue and no doctors could cure
[1:18:58] perhaps she'd sell it all she had to pay
[1:19:00] the physicians and they had tried hard
[1:19:02] but had failed
[1:19:03] but she believed that she could touch
[1:19:05] his garments she'd get well
[1:19:07] and she went through the crowd and
[1:19:09] touched his garment now the palestinian
[1:19:11] garment has an underneath garment and a
[1:19:14] road that hangs loose and she touched
[1:19:16] the border that would probably be that
[1:19:18] far from me swinging loose and she
[1:19:21] touched the border with her finger went
[1:19:22] back through the crowd and sat down
[1:19:24] stood up for whatever she did
[1:19:27] jesus stopped and said who touched me
[1:19:30] just think of that now i remember we're
[1:19:32] talking about jesus
[1:19:34] everything in the healing lines to my
[1:19:36] opinion has to be scriptural
[1:19:39] has to be on the bible
[1:19:41] has to be what he was what he'd done
[1:19:43] just what he done
[1:19:45] then he is the one we're looking to
[1:19:47] today
[1:19:48] he is the one that promised to be here
[1:19:50] the same yesterday and forever
[1:19:53] is there any strangers in here there's
[1:19:54] never been one of the meetings before
[1:19:57] i guess one woman two two people let's
[1:20:00] see all right
[1:20:02] so the woman touched me went back and
[1:20:04] sat down and she
[1:20:06] sitting there and jesus said who touched
[1:20:08] me and peter come up and just literally
[1:20:11] you rebuked him the bible said what
[1:20:13] imagine the apostle said something like
[1:20:15] this what do you mean by seeing a thing
[1:20:17] like that
[1:20:19] why yours 500 people and every one of
[1:20:21] them is touching you jesus said but i
[1:20:23] got weak
[1:20:24] virtue went from him
[1:20:27] and he looked around
[1:20:29] in the audience and he found the woman
[1:20:32] and he told her her blood issue had
[1:20:34] stopped
[1:20:35] because her faith had made her well is
[1:20:37] that right
[1:20:38] now how many of you ministers and bible
[1:20:40] readers knows that the bible the new
[1:20:42] testament that jesus christ is the same
[1:20:44] yesterday and forever
[1:20:47] how many knows that the bible said that
[1:20:49] he is right now
[1:20:50] on the right hand of god in the majesty
[1:20:53] on high his literal body sitting there a
[1:20:55] high priest making intercessions upon
[1:20:58] our confession and he can be touched
[1:21:01] by the feeling of our infirmities
[1:21:07] now his body's up there
[1:21:09] his spirits down here
[1:21:11] his body is spirit god's spirit work
[1:21:13] through that body his virgin born son
[1:21:16] in the fullness of god he works through
[1:21:19] you and i as portions of god
[1:21:21] that's why the holy spirit when it come
[1:21:23] on the day of pentecost it broke all up
[1:21:25] that pillar of fire and divided itself
[1:21:27] in lips of tongues and set up on each
[1:21:29] one we have to have one another
[1:21:32] the biggest thing the devil ever got on
[1:21:34] us was when he separated us from the
[1:21:36] love of god from one another and we love
[1:21:38] one another that's brotherly love when
[1:21:40] we can get to one another if you've got
[1:21:42] part of the holy ghost and i got part of
[1:21:44] the next man's got part of it put us
[1:21:45] together there's three parts
[1:21:47] i'm three times as strong as it was with
[1:21:49] you two brothers see that's where we
[1:21:51] stand
[1:21:52] i'm a real kentuckian together we stand
[1:21:55] and divide it we'll fall that's right we
[1:21:57] must stand that way together
[1:22:00] now if jesus christ is the same high
[1:22:03] priest that that woman touched
[1:22:05] by the feeling of her infirmities and
[1:22:07] he's the same high priest he'll act the
[1:22:09] same he'll do the same
[1:22:11] if you can touch him
[1:22:13] now today
[1:22:14] he's only you can't touch him with your
[1:22:16] finger you've got to touch him with your
[1:22:17] faith
[1:22:19] is that right
[1:22:20] is that right your faith is what touches
[1:22:22] you you can't touch me your finger
[1:22:23] because he's sitting on the throne of
[1:22:25] god
[1:22:26] i may believe that jesus overcome and
[1:22:28] set out on god's throne
[1:22:31] and promise that if we overcome we will
[1:22:33] set with him on his throne as he's
[1:22:35] overcome and set down on god's throne
[1:22:37] that's exactly what he said
[1:22:39] all right
[1:22:41] then if that is so
[1:22:43] then if you tonight are out there here's
[1:22:46] all the prayer cards standing
[1:22:48] and you're out there without prayer
[1:22:49] cards and you will believe with all your
[1:22:51] heart that your faith can touch him and
[1:22:54] you believe it
[1:22:55] then god will answer and act just the
[1:22:58] same as a high priest did at the
[1:22:59] beginning you believe that
[1:23:01] have you got the all the clear lines of
[1:23:02] whole 50 of the third part that be
[1:23:08] tonight the reason i call the whole
[1:23:10] bunch this is not a line of discernment
[1:23:12] this is not afraid for the sake
[1:23:15] the discernment comes each night in the
[1:23:17] meetings
[1:23:18] but he's here just the same
[1:23:20] do you believe that
[1:23:22] sure is if there's not one thing done
[1:23:25] he's still here
[1:23:26] to heal the sick
[1:23:38] how many out there now that is sick yet
[1:23:40] i see your hands
[1:23:45] if
[1:23:46] how many out there that raise your hands
[1:23:48] believe that when jesus is here on earth
[1:23:51] that the way he made himself known being
[1:23:53] a messiah he could tell the people
[1:23:56] what was their trouble and so forth how
[1:23:57] many knows that knows that that's a
[1:23:59] promise of the bible
[1:24:01] well then you know that i could not be
[1:24:04] him because he's sitting on the right
[1:24:06] hand of god but he promised the works
[1:24:08] that he did what we do also
[1:24:11] he promised in the last days that the
[1:24:13] church should grow so close from the
[1:24:14] days of luther justification days of
[1:24:17] wesley sanctification days of the
[1:24:19] pentecost the restoration gets right
[1:24:21] into the headstone
[1:24:24] and through that would bring forth the
[1:24:26] whole body the resurrection of every
[1:24:28] believer
[1:24:29] but as a the spirit of god grows closer
[1:24:32] just like the shadow of my hand the
[1:24:34] shadow gets darker and darker and darker
[1:24:36] until the shadow and the hand becomes
[1:24:38] the same thing the church come from
[1:24:40] justification sanctification baptism
[1:24:42] holy ghost now going into the very
[1:24:45] headstone and the presence of the angel
[1:24:47] of god jesus christ the holy ghost so
[1:24:49] present doing exactly the same works
[1:24:51] that he did on earth which is bringing
[1:24:53] forth the church and the christ and
[1:24:55] unite
[1:24:56] together just exactly what he promised
[1:25:00] i don't let your conscience be dull now
[1:25:03] wake up
[1:25:04] my heavenly father
[1:25:07] i promise the people just to bring them
[1:25:09] through this prayer line and pray for
[1:25:11] him
[1:25:12] but i pray thee father that you will
[1:25:14] grant at least one or two people
[1:25:17] somewhere in here that have witnessed
[1:25:19] because there's some here that has never
[1:25:21] known this only two hands that went up
[1:25:23] but they'd never been in the meetings
[1:25:24] before but lord that might be the very
[1:25:27] few people that you're calling tonight
[1:25:30] so to be sure that if the day of
[1:25:32] judgment i want nothing
[1:25:34] that i have left undone
[1:25:36] i pray thee father for a few moments
[1:25:39] that if you'll send your holy spirit out
[1:25:41] among those people and charge their
[1:25:43] bodies as they raise their hands a while
[1:25:45] ago that you will perform the same works
[1:25:48] here that you did like the woman at the
[1:25:50] well when you talk to her a man and a
[1:25:52] woman and you told her where her secret
[1:25:54] was what her trouble was
[1:25:56] why she said sir i perceive that you're
[1:25:59] a prophet
[1:26:00] we know that when the messiah cometh
[1:26:02] he'll tell us these things
[1:26:04] and he said i'm he that speaks to you
[1:26:06] she ran into the city and told the man
[1:26:08] come see a man that's told me the things
[1:26:10] i've done isn't this the messiah
[1:26:13] god granted again tonight we asked it in
[1:26:16] jesus name amen
[1:26:20] each night i've been turning my back to
[1:26:21] the audience that you might know and god
[1:26:24] to vindicate
[1:26:25] that there how many knows that jesus
[1:26:27] said as it was in the days of sodom
[1:26:32] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[1:26:34] of man
[1:26:35] he said
[1:26:36] uh what happened at sodom now he said it
[1:26:38] was the days of noah
[1:26:40] eight souls were saved
[1:26:42] by water
[1:26:44] well you see where the minority is going
[1:26:46] to be before the caps put on the stone
[1:26:49] comes back
[1:26:53] now
[1:26:55] that chief cornerstone goes into the
[1:26:57] building and fits it together
[1:27:00] now
[1:27:03] he said what that would be he said what
[1:27:05] they were doing in the days of no eating
[1:27:06] drinking marrying and giving in marriage
[1:27:09] but when he come to sodom
[1:27:12] he left that for the discernment of the
[1:27:13] church
[1:27:14] i see there was a believer lukewarm
[1:27:16] church member and an unbeliever and
[1:27:19] abraham was out of sodom which means he
[1:27:22] elected and called out the church
[1:27:26] and that one two angels went down into
[1:27:29] sodom they'd done a few things such as
[1:27:31] smite and blind putting curse on the
[1:27:33] people
[1:27:35] to the church member had a meeting
[1:27:38] called for mercy from the run out but
[1:27:40] they didn't do it
[1:27:41] just like
[1:27:42] the message goes forth today but there's
[1:27:44] one angel who stayed with the church
[1:27:46] elect
[1:27:48] and he said to abraham now he was a
[1:27:50] stranger
[1:27:51] he said
[1:27:52] abraham
[1:27:53] where is your wife sarah
[1:27:56] your wife sarah stranger
[1:28:01] said in the tent behind you
[1:28:03] said i'm not going to keep this from you
[1:28:04] ah personal pronoun now i'm not going to
[1:28:07] keep this from you but according to time
[1:28:08] of life sarah's going to be a young
[1:28:10] woman again you've heard me preach on it
[1:28:12] and she's going to go back have this
[1:28:14] baby and sarah in the tent behind the
[1:28:16] man had never seen him in the tent
[1:28:20] laughed within herself and the angel
[1:28:21] with his back turned said why did sarah
[1:28:24] laugh
[1:28:27] abraham calling elohim
[1:28:30] not the man sitting there eating
[1:28:32] steak and
[1:28:33] drinking milk eating cornbread
[1:28:36] but it was the spirit that was in him
[1:28:39] now what was it a sign of that the
[1:28:41] spirit of god would dwell in the flesh
[1:28:43] of people again and show the same sign
[1:28:45] before the end time as it was in the
[1:28:47] days of sodom
[1:28:49] so shall it be in the coming son of man
[1:28:51] now sodom was the one that burned fire
[1:28:53] fell out of the heavens and burned them
[1:28:55] and that's what's going to happen again
[1:28:57] it ain't going to be water it's going to
[1:28:58] be fire
[1:28:59] so the angel of mercy comes with the
[1:29:01] same message to warn the people
[1:29:04] stay away from sodom
[1:29:07] now you pray and see if you can touch
[1:29:08] his garment and may he add his blessing
[1:29:12] just a moment billy

[1:29:16] audience first then when i start that
