[34:01] ready to go to Uganda want to have the
[34:03] young people out uh for now unless I
[34:05] change it we'll do 10 o'cl here at the
[34:07] church for the Youth to get together and
[34:10] go through some of these boxes and we're
[34:12] going to get a shipment to go overseas
[34:14] so that's I'm really looking forward to
[34:16] that we'll eventually probably bring
[34:18] them uh brother Caleb perz from Las
[34:22] crusis and his church they'll help us
[34:25] get the more over there to Uganda I'm
[34:28] looking forward to that and then
[34:30] afterwards the youth will have a um a
[34:34] volleyball event at uh at the um sister
[34:39] Connie and brother Kevin's house um so
[34:42] that and that'll be for the Youth we'll
[34:43] go 13 and up for that and they wish they
[34:47] could have everybody there but they
[34:48] can't they have so that's just for the
[34:51] Youth we um got to tell you as I've been
[34:55] studying this book of Deuteronomy over
[34:58] the
[34:59] past few days past week I got really sad
[35:04] and thinking how important that this
[35:07] book was and and when it was written and
[35:11] the the spirit that it was written in we
[35:13] have this man Moses who wrote These
[35:16] first five books of the Bible we call
[35:17] them the Torah he wrote Genesis and then
[35:22] Exodus is an account of Moses's birth
[35:27] and his life and then the Exodus coming
[35:31] out of Egypt tremendous story and and
[35:35] you know
[35:36] it beautiful little baby born and put
[35:39] into the Nile River then he's taken out
[35:42] he he raises up to where he was probably
[35:44] going to be the next Pharaoh he made a
[35:46] stand for his people then he ends up
[35:50] going into the Wilderness and Exile and
[35:52] the Lord brings him back he has the
[35:54] experience with the burning bush brings
[35:56] him back
[35:58] he through a mighty hand pulls all of
[36:01] these slaves out of Egypt and then we go
[36:05] to Leviticus and as I ministered on
[36:08] Leviticus Leviticus is it's a very
[36:12] special book in that God made a way for
[36:17] the people to live in his presence they
[36:21] were a sinful people as we all are and
[36:24] God had given them this thing we call
[36:27] the law and and the Bible calls it the
[36:29] law and allow them to get closer to God
[36:34] and to live in his presence and I use
[36:36] the analogy of the sun if you get too
[36:39] close to the Sun the power of the sun
[36:42] will burn you up but if you get too far
[36:45] away from the Sun you'll die you'll
[36:48] freeze to death so you want to live in
[36:51] the right presence of the son and that's
[36:54] what the Book of Leviticus did it made a
[36:56] way for the people to live close to God
[37:01] and to get the benefits of being around
[37:04] him and that's what this thing called
[37:06] the law is very very special ordinances
[37:10] that God set forth that the people would
[37:13] live and then we get to numbers
[37:17] numbers was when when we had Leviticus
[37:20] we have Exodus they come out at ends
[37:21] they're at Mount Si when Moses gets the
[37:23] Ten Commandments Leviticus that um Moses
[37:27] brings those Commandments tells them to
[37:28] the people they're still right there at
[37:30] Mount Si they've only been out of Egypt
[37:32] for less than 11 months less than a year
[37:35] and then the Book of Numbers is when
[37:37] they start upon their
[37:39] Journey brother Lyall brought that last
[37:42] week and and they had an amazing thing
[37:45] they had a pillar of fire in the daytime
[37:48] or in the night time and a pillar of
[37:49] cloud at night that would lead them out
[37:52] through the
[37:53] Wilderness and they had all kinds of of
[37:56] things happened when they were there
[37:59] they um the people immediately started
[38:04] complaining and it angered God In This
[38:08] Book of
[38:09] Numbers they they even came against
[38:12] Moses
[38:13] himself in this
[38:15] book and as they're traveling through
[38:20] this
[38:21] desert they come to this place called
[38:25] Kadesh Baria
[38:27] God had promised remember Abraham like
[38:30] 400 years earlier that he was going to
[38:32] give them a Promised Land Moses was this
[38:35] deliverer he goes out and he he brings
[38:37] them out and he says hey we're going to
[38:38] go to this promised land they get
[38:40] excited they go out God shows his shows
[38:44] himself on Mount Si they Moses brings
[38:47] down the law the people start moving
[38:50] they start complaining they start doing
[38:52] their thing and then they come to this
[38:54] place called Kadesh Baria and this is
[38:57] right where right across the river from
[39:00] the promised land they were right there
[39:04] so Moses takes 12 men Great Men sends
[39:10] them over this River to spy out this
[39:13] land they go out there and they
[39:16] witnessed that this land was everything
[39:19] that God said it was it was a land
[39:22] flowing with milk and honey it had
[39:24] grapes and had figs and it had all this
[39:27] this wonderful place that they would
[39:29] live their lives but they came back and
[39:32] 10 of the 12 Spies that went
[39:34] over they said we can't do it these are
[39:37] really big men over there they're
[39:41] Giants we can't we we can't there's no
[39:44] way that we could take the land and
[39:46] Joshua and and Caleb said no we can take
[39:51] it God's for us we're able it doesn't
[39:54] matter and they were afraid that 10 were
[39:56] afraid over here they had forgotten that
[40:00] Moses went to the Red Sea they came to
[40:02] this Red Sea and the this armies were
[40:04] following them and God parted the Red
[40:08] Sea on both sides if he can do that
[40:10] surely he can kill a
[40:12] giant and then after that the water
[40:15] comes back down and destroys Pharaoh's
[40:17] Army and then they get hungry and they
[40:19] start complaining of that God Reigns
[40:22] food in the form of Mana down from
[40:24] heaven and yet they complain expained
[40:27] and then they get
[40:29] thirsty Moses goes up to the Rock God
[40:32] tells him to Smite The Rock he smites
[40:34] the rock water comes out of the Rock and
[40:36] then they
[40:38] drink on and on God gives them
[40:42] Miracles and yet they
[40:45] complained and these men come over and
[40:48] then they come back from kades Baria
[40:50] they start saying that we can't do it
[40:52] Joshua and Caleb are saying we can and
[40:55] they get the people these 10 get the
[40:57] people all stirred up into a big problem
[41:00] and a big fight to the point where they
[41:02] were going to kill even
[41:04] Moses Moses goes before God and what did
[41:07] Moses do God killed them no Moses
[41:13] pleads for their for Mercy from
[41:17] God God says all right I won't kill him
[41:20] but they're not going to go into the
[41:21] promised land in fact every single one
[41:25] of them is going to die in this
[41:27] Wilderness except for those two ones
[41:30] that they believed in
[41:32] me and remember Moses he had smoked the
[41:36] rock the first time water came forth he
[41:38] comes out God tells him this time speak
[41:40] to the Rock they need water so speak to
[41:42] the Rock he goes out Moses glorified
[41:45] himself smacked The Rock God told him to
[41:49] speak to it he smacks it doesn't water
[41:52] doesn't come out he does it again water
[41:55] comes out God tells Moses now you are
[41:59] not going to go over because you
[42:01] disobeyed me so here we have all of
[42:05] these Israelites that were promised to
[42:07] go
[42:08] over and none of them except for two the
[42:14] two loyal men and Joshua and Caleb were
[42:18] going to be able to go over and God
[42:19] promised that so they wander in the
[42:22] wilderness for 40 years they were right
[42:27] there at Kadesh Baria but instead they
[42:30] go wandering around this Wilderness for
[42:32] 40 years and they start dying
[42:35] out all of these people millions of them
[42:38] have to
[42:39] die before this next Generation can come
[42:42] up so when we're understanding this book
[42:45] of Deuteronomy we have to have to
[42:48] understand the setting
[42:51] here and the
[42:53] setting is Moses is an old man he's one
[42:58] of the last ones left and he's giving
[43:01] his final statements to these Hebrews
[43:05] before he is going to die and then this
[43:09] next generation is going to go over the
[43:12] Jordan River so that's the setting in
[43:14] the book of
[43:15] Deuteronomy
[43:17] Deuteronomy is a Greek name which I
[43:20] don't really understand it's a Greek
[43:22] name for a Hebrew Book and it means the
[43:25] second law brother ROM called it two
[43:29] laws and it's a series of sermons by
[43:34] Moses and the Book of Deuteronomy really
[43:38] there's nothing new in the book we
[43:41] pretty much know all the stories and all
[43:43] the law that is mentioned in Deuteronomy
[43:45] but this is Moses right at the end and
[43:48] this is a Next Generation that's coming
[43:50] up they've been wandering in the
[43:51] wilderness 40 years with the promise
[43:54] that all of these people have to die
[43:56] before you can go over this Jordan so
[44:01] Moses is now knows that it's his time to
[44:04] go everyone else is gone so Moses is
[44:07] preaching a series of
[44:10] sermons and that's the book of
[44:12] Deuteronomy so we get to hear Moses
[44:15] preach tonight and these are his closing
[44:18] statements This is the End Moses is
[44:21] doing his best now to say Hey listen to
[44:24] what I've told you because this is this
[44:27] is it I'm about to leave now you people
[44:31] your parents are gone your grandparents
[44:33] are gone but you have to carry on with
[44:37] this word of God that I brought
[44:39] you the first 11 chapters of Deuteronomy
[44:43] Moses summarizes what has happened so
[44:45] far and calls on this generation to be
[44:48] more faithful than those before him then
[44:52] in chapters 12-6 it's a collection of
[44:54] laws in the center of the book and most
[44:58] of them are repeats from the previous
[45:01] books with uh one of them they're
[45:03] talking about the central Temple that
[45:05] there's one God and then chapters 16- 18
[45:09] Outlaws the um outlines the character of
[45:12] leadership among the the priests the
[45:15] elders and the priests and they were all
[45:17] placed within the authority of the law
[45:20] and then he says this he he he puts all
[45:24] of these elders and Priests in order and
[45:27] then he says that I'm even going to send
[45:30] prophets now to make sure in the future
[45:33] to make sure everyone is living up to
[45:36] what Moses has said and he introduces
[45:40] these prophets that are to come to keep
[45:43] people straight morally and with with
[45:47] this the law then 19 through 26 there's
[45:51] more laws about marriage and family and
[45:53] widows and orphans and business and all
[45:55] kinds of everyday life and also more
[45:58] laws about
[46:00] worship and what these are is these laws
[46:02] laws are what separates Israel that sets
[46:05] Israel aside from the rest of the world
[46:09] I'll get into that here in a little
[46:12] bit and then in 27 through 34 Moses
[46:16] issues a challenge to Israel to listen
[46:20] and to love God and if you listen to him
[46:24] and you love him then things will go
[46:26] well but if you don't then there's going
[46:30] to be continued problems and sufferings
[46:33] and God is even going to kick you out of
[46:36] this land that you're about to go
[46:39] into so Moses knew and unfortunately
[46:44] Moses knew everyone that was there he
[46:46] knew their parents and he knew their
[46:47] grandparents and he knew that these
[46:50] people that were going over were
[46:51] probably going to go the same way as
[46:53] their parents had gone
[46:56] but he
[46:57] still Moses ends his sermons here with a
[47:01] blessing like all the prophets do and
[47:04] then Moses walks up to the mountain and
[47:06] he dies so let's start with Deuteronomy
[47:09] chapter 1 verse
[47:13] one these be The Words which Moses spake
[47:16] unto all Israel on this side Jordan in
[47:20] the wilderness in the plain over against
[47:22] the Red Sea between perin and toppel and
[47:25] L
[47:26] and hezaro and
[47:28] diab there are 11 days journey from Hed
[47:33] by the way of Mount seir to Kadesh
[47:35] barnea and it came to pass in the 40th
[47:38] year in the 11th month on the first day
[47:41] of the month that Moses spake unto the
[47:43] children of Israel according to all the
[47:45] Lord had given him in commandment unto
[47:48] them now this is very interesting you
[47:49] look at verse two and it it it makes a
[47:53] statement that would be really easy to
[47:54] look over it says that this should have
[47:57] only taken 11
[48:00] days from Horeb to Kadesh barnea Horeb
[48:05] is the mountain range that Mount Si is
[48:09] in and it should have only been 11 days
[48:11] journey to the promised
[48:14] land but
[48:16] then it says now you're in the 40th year
[48:20] of this journey so he lays it all out
[48:23] right there in these first couple verses
[48:25] he said it should have only taken you 11
[48:27] days but you've been there 40
[48:35] years and he and he goes on and he says
[48:37] when we arrived at kades Baria I sent 12
[48:40] Spies over as I said now he's going to
[48:42] tell this story
[48:43] again I sent 12 Spies over and you spied
[48:46] out the land and it was a good land and
[48:48] you even brought back some of the fruit
[48:50] that was there but you said that they
[48:52] were too big for us to battle these men
[48:55] these Giants and then you complained and
[48:58] the Lord took you out of e the Lord took
[49:00] you out of Egypt to give you into the
[49:02] the hands of your enemy so you said
[49:04] these people said after all these
[49:07] Miracles they said that the Lord took us
[49:10] out of Egypt just to give us into the
[49:12] hands of our enemies look at the lack of
[49:14] faith that is in these
[49:17] people so Joshua and Caleb and Moses
[49:20] here says don't you know that God fights
[49:22] for you the Lord carried you through the
[49:24] Wilderness like like a father would
[49:26] carry a son it's not just you that has
[49:29] to go to these battles it's God that
[49:31] goes to these battles for you but you
[49:33] wouldn't trust him skip to verse 34 it
[49:36] says right here and the Lord Heard a
[49:38] Voice of your words and was wroth and
[49:41] swear saying surely there shall not be
[49:44] one of these men of this evil generation
[49:47] see that good land which I swear to give
[49:50] unto your
[49:51] fathers because of all the complaining
[49:53] because of the lack of confidence none
[49:56] of you are going to go over this Jordan
[49:58] and Moses right now don't forget is
[50:01] speaking to not all those that Sinn but
[50:04] he's speaking to their children and
[50:06] their
[50:08] grandchildren except for Caleb save
[50:12] Caleb the son of
[50:14] japun he shall see it and to him will I
[50:18] give the land that Heath trodden upon
[50:20] and to his children because he hath
[50:22] wholly followed the Lord also the Lord
[50:25] was angry with me for your sakes saying
[50:28] Thou shalt not go in tither so Moses is
[50:31] saying here that the Lord is punishing
[50:32] me
[50:33] too because of your unbelief and I can't
[50:37] go into the promised
[50:39] land but Joshua the son of none which
[50:42] standeth before thee he must have been
[50:44] as Moses is here preaching Joshua must
[50:46] been must have been standing right there
[50:48] with
[50:50] Moses but Joshua the son of none which
[50:54] standeth before thee he shall go inther
[50:57] encourage him for he shall cause Israel
[51:00] to inherit
[51:02] it now
[51:04] notice these two men Joshua and Caleb as
[51:06] I said before they are it they're the
[51:10] only ones that are going to go over now
[51:13] remember I said that when they went over
[51:18] they went over to to spy out the land
[51:20] and they said these men are too big we
[51:22] get a little uh example of how big these
[51:25] Giants were in chapter 3 and this is
[51:29] this is really neat in chapter 3: 11 it
[51:33] says this for only OG the king of Bashan
[51:37] remained of the remnant of the Giants
[51:39] behold his bedstead was a bedstead of
[51:44] iron is not is it not in rabbath of the
[51:47] children of Ammon nine cubits was the
[51:50] length thereof and four cubits was the
[51:54] breadth thereof after the Cubit of a
[51:57] man so how big is a king-sized bed it's
[52:01] like 6 and 1/2 ft
[52:04] long this man's bed was 13 and5 feet
[52:11] long that's how much bigger they were
[52:15] than even us and you imagine the
[52:18] Israelites were a smaller group of
[52:20] people and then this guy's sleeping on a
[52:22] 13 and 1/2t long bed a big guy and he
[52:25] represented all these Giants out there
[52:28] so this is what these people saw they're
[52:30] like whoa these guys are huge but they
[52:33] forgot what God had done for them so
[52:37] there so it it puts it into context
[52:40] there and then God rebuked them for not
[52:42] trusting
[52:45] him verse 39 there back
[52:49] um in uh chapter one moreover your
[52:54] little ones
[52:55] which he said you said should be a prey
[53:00] and your children which that day had no
[53:02] knowledge between good and evil they
[53:04] shall go hither tither and unto them
[53:09] will I give and they shall possess it so
[53:11] he's telling again he's telling them
[53:13] that your children are the ones that go
[53:16] over as I said none of this is new Moses
[53:19] is repeating what he had preached all
[53:22] through this journey and these are his
[53:24] closes statements this is the last thing
[53:26] that he's
[53:29] saying but as for you turn you and take
[53:32] your Journey Into the Wilderness by the
[53:34] way of the Red Sea then they answered
[53:36] and said unto me we have sinned against
[53:38] the Lord and we'll go up and fight now
[53:40] he's talking about Kadesh
[53:41] Baria we will go up and fight according
[53:44] to all that the Lord commanded us and we
[53:46] when ye had gted up GED on every man as
[53:48] weapons of war you were ready to go up
[53:51] into the hill now let me explain here
[53:52] what's going on Moses is again repeating
[53:55] what what had happened when they were at
[53:56] C Cades baras so they went across they
[53:58] chickened
[54:00] out and then they come back and Moses
[54:04] said none of you is going to go over and
[54:05] they're like wait a minute we change our
[54:07] mind uh we can do it we can go battle
[54:10] them you know God was with us he was the
[54:11] Red Sea the man of following yeah we can
[54:13] go do it and God said no you
[54:16] won't God said you're finished because
[54:19] now if you go over and try to fight
[54:21] these Giants guess who's not going to be
[54:24] with you
[54:26] me and you will die if I'm not with you
[54:29] so Moses is telling that story again to
[54:33] these
[54:34] people so
[54:36] then in chapter three Moses was
[54:41] commissioned um in chapter 3 Moses tells
[54:44] the perspective of what had
[54:47] happened when he brought the people out
[54:50] of Egypt and he says this chapter 3: 23
[54:55] and I besought the Lord at that time I'm
[54:58] sorry this is
[55:01] when I uh let me let me something's
[55:05] bothering me I don't know what it is can
[55:08] you tell let me just I want to I'll just
[55:12] come down a minute I don't know the enem
[55:14] is enem is here for some reason let's
[55:17] just bow our heads for a
[55:19] minute
[55:20] father I feel off for some
[55:24] reason Lord I pray that whatever it
[55:27] would be that maybe I got out of your
[55:29] will
[55:31] Lord maybe I'm nervous feel odd but
[55:35] Lord I feel like I've
[55:39] strayed I pray father that youd bring me
[55:41] back to the
[55:44] path and Lord set this service straight
[55:48] now I pray in Jesus Christ's name
[55:52] amen sometimes
[55:56] it's good to just stop and say Lord I
[56:00] feel like I've done something wrong I
[56:02] don't know what I
[56:03] did and Lord would you maybe put me back
[56:09] on the path of of what he wants for this
[56:12] service
[56:13] tonight Moses
[56:16] was as Moses is preaching this sermon to
[56:19] the
[56:20] people it was so important to him that
[56:25] this was his whole life that was coming
[56:29] to an end and this book of Deuteronomy
[56:31] these these sermons that he was
[56:33] preaching right here this was
[56:37] everything this was this was it all of
[56:40] the Miracles that had happened it had
[56:42] came to this point where Moses is there
[56:46] and he's preaching to this next
[56:49] Generation to come and he's saying don't
[56:52] stray from what I've told you Don't
[56:55] Stray From This law this law is there to
[56:57] help
[56:58] you take care listen to it all read it
[57:04] day and night talk about it in in your
[57:07] living rooms around your family tell
[57:10] them about
[57:11] it and your families now they're gone
[57:16] because they
[57:19] sinned and now you this next
[57:23] generation
[57:25] will you follow God's
[57:29] word will you do what he
[57:33] said and here they are listening to
[57:37] Moses many of them probably didn't
[57:41] witness the pillar of fire way
[57:45] back way back earlier many of them
[57:49] weren't none of them were there with the
[57:52] plagues and all this they were just they
[57:54] had just been told
[57:56] stories and now here they are this next
[57:59] generation and they are chosen to go
[58:02] over with this man Joshua and let me
[58:05] tell you there was a great obstacle on
[58:07] the other side of this Jordan River and
[58:10] here they
[58:11] are Moses is trying to get
[58:17] them in the spirit to serve
[58:21] God and he's saying don't forget
[58:25] what I have told you don't forget these
[58:27] things so in chapter 3 he was
[58:31] reiterating these
[58:34] stories verse number
[58:36] 28 he says this he says but charge
[58:40] Joshua and encourage him and strengthen
[58:44] him he's going to be your new
[58:46] leader for he shall go over before the
[58:49] people and he shall cause them to
[58:51] inherit the land which Thou shalt see so
[58:54] we Abode in the valley over against
[58:59] bethor now Moses right here he's laying
[59:01] the foundation for his successor he's
[59:03] telling the people listen I'm leaving
[59:06] but follow him he's the one that's going
[59:08] to lead you
[59:10] over and he's telling the people to keep
[59:13] this law as they go into the land
[59:15] because if they don't they will end up
[59:18] the same way as their parents
[59:20] did Deuteronomy chapter
[59:23] 4 verse five Moses again warning as I
[59:27] was reading this I was thinking Moses
[59:30] has a very corrective
[59:33] Ministry Moses he he really tells him
[59:36] he's like listen you're
[59:39] Sinners and he says come out of that he
[59:42] says if you'll just serve God then
[59:44] you'll do
[59:46] well chapter 4 verse 5 he says this
[59:48] behold I have taught you statutes and
[59:50] judgments even as the Lord my God
[59:53] commanded me that that you should do so
[59:55] in the land whether you go to possess it
[59:58] keep therefore and do them for this is
[1:00:01] your wisdom and your understanding in
[1:00:04] the sight of the Nations which shall
[1:00:06] hear all these statutes and say surely
[1:00:10] this nation is a wise and understanding
[1:00:15] people what a
[1:00:19] lesson so he's saying you're
[1:00:22] different he's saying the word of God is
[1:00:25] what separates you from the rest of the
[1:00:29] world and we look at this today that's
[1:00:32] what separates a Christian from the rest
[1:00:35] of the world it's the same lesson as
[1:00:37] Moses is teaching right here we are
[1:00:39] different we are called out we don't act
[1:00:44] like the world we don't talk like the
[1:00:47] world we don't worship the idols like
[1:00:50] they did over in Canaan over on the
[1:00:52] other side of Jordan we we need to be
[1:00:55] separate from that and that's what this
[1:00:57] law has done it has taught us not to do
[1:01:00] these
[1:01:01] things very very important
[1:01:06] lesson he says that you're a great
[1:01:09] nation and you're wise in understanding
[1:01:12] because of not
[1:01:15] you but because of the
[1:01:19] law because of the word that that I
[1:01:23] brought Moses speaking that's why you're
[1:01:26] special not because of anything else but
[1:01:29] because of this word is why you're
[1:01:33] special oh then he says this is
[1:01:35] beautiful for what nation is there so
[1:01:39] great who hath God so nigh unto them as
[1:01:43] the Lord Our God in all things that we
[1:01:46] call upon him
[1:01:48] for what people have God so close to
[1:01:52] them as you do
[1:01:55] wow brother Hy what a
[1:01:57] statement you're
[1:02:00] different you're close to God because
[1:02:04] you believe his word and you're acting
[1:02:07] on his word and what nation is there so
[1:02:11] great that has statutes and judgments so
[1:02:15] righteousness so righteous as all the
[1:02:18] law which I set before you this day
[1:02:21] again you're different you're not of
[1:02:22] this world you're a separated people
[1:02:24] because of the
[1:02:27] word only take heed to thyself and keep
[1:02:30] thy Soul diligently lest thou forget the
[1:02:32] things which thine eyes have seen unless
[1:02:35] they depart from thy heart all the days
[1:02:38] of thy life but teach them thy sons and
[1:02:41] thy Sons
[1:02:43] Sons teach this law walk in this law and
[1:02:48] you will do
[1:02:50] well very very very important thing
[1:02:54] brother Aaron he's he's sick
[1:02:56] today he called me this
[1:03:00] morning
[1:03:01] and he was he was telling me a testimony
[1:03:04] from yesterday I was down in Douglas
[1:03:07] yesterday and we were coming back and we
[1:03:09] saw on the um on the Google Maps that
[1:03:11] there was a wreck there I think is
[1:03:13] around AA
[1:03:15] Road well brother Aaron was was was was
[1:03:19] driving in was driving down I 10
[1:03:25] and it slowed down and brother Aaron
[1:03:28] told me he said then everything slowed
[1:03:31] down and he said then the traffic
[1:03:33] started to speed
[1:03:35] up and brother Aon brother Aon
[1:03:38] accelerated and he said wait a
[1:03:41] minute he said the law says
[1:03:45] 55 brother Aaron got up to 55 miles an
[1:03:48] hour and everybody started blowing by
[1:03:51] him and then right in front of brother
[1:03:53] Aaron
[1:03:55] the wreck happened a big tractor trailer
[1:03:58] jack knife brother Aaron said if I was
[1:04:00] going the same speed as everyone else I
[1:04:03] would have hit that truck there would
[1:04:05] have been no way but he was following
[1:04:08] the
[1:04:09] law do you see how the law was given for
[1:04:12] our
[1:04:13] safety the law was given for our
[1:04:16] benefit and then brother Aaron called me
[1:04:18] he's like he said brother Daniel he says
[1:04:22] this is exactly
[1:04:24] like Deuteronomy and and and he says I
[1:04:27] prayed I said Lord I bet you he's going
[1:04:29] to talk about that tonight and there's
[1:04:31] brother Aaron and he said he say this
[1:04:34] was exactly what it says right there if
[1:04:37] he wouldn't have followed the law he
[1:04:39] would have
[1:04:44] suffered
[1:04:46] often we try to take the Torah the
[1:04:50] law and we try to apply it exactly to
[1:04:54] our lives but that doesn't
[1:04:58] work there's there's laws about how you
[1:05:01] cut your
[1:05:02] beard there's laws about things you
[1:05:04] would wonder you'd be like well why does
[1:05:06] that matter but it is
[1:05:08] important it was very very important
[1:05:11] back then and it's just as important
[1:05:14] today that we take the law we take the
[1:05:18] word and we do our best to apply it to
[1:05:22] our lives and we might think we might
[1:05:25] look back to this book of Deuteronomy
[1:05:29] and we might back look back to the
[1:05:30] people and we say oh they live this holy
[1:05:34] life and this very legalistic life then
[1:05:37] they must be they must have been more
[1:05:39] they must have been very very clean but
[1:05:41] today friends we should be more clean
[1:05:46] than they were back then they had the
[1:05:49] law they had the the rule book there
[1:05:53] which was was sent there to take care of
[1:05:55] them like brother Aaron with the 55 mph
[1:05:58] speed limit very important but now that
[1:06:03] law has become flesh in
[1:06:07] us and we become one with that law so no
[1:06:12] we don't live
[1:06:14] less of a life than them we live more
[1:06:19] holy than they lived we are more
[1:06:23] responsible today than they were back
[1:06:26] then they had this book of the law now
[1:06:30] this law is in us and it should be
[1:06:33] applied in everything that we do the law
[1:06:36] was
[1:06:37] limited I mean you couldn't write enough
[1:06:39] books to cover every single thing but
[1:06:43] now this word of God is here and it
[1:06:47] applies George to everything we
[1:06:50] do to to driving to to what you look at
[1:06:54] at to what you look at on your phone to
[1:06:56] to everything that's not written there
[1:07:00] because these times have changed but
[1:07:03] now the law is here and it makes our it
[1:07:07] judges
[1:07:09] everything so we are able to make these
[1:07:11] decisions all the
[1:07:14] time what a
[1:07:16] story with brother Aaron and what he
[1:07:19] said and it was a perfect
[1:07:22] timing do Deuteronomy is mentioned in
[1:07:26] the Old Testament it's quoted this is
[1:07:29] how important it was 350
[1:07:32] times and it's mentioned in the New
[1:07:35] Testament 95 times so you hear so much
[1:07:39] oh well that's Old Testament that almost
[1:07:41] like it doesn't matter it doesn't apply
[1:07:42] to today well then why would the New
[1:07:44] Testament authors write quote it 95
[1:07:47] times it's very very important times
[1:07:51] change but this word doesn't change
[1:07:57] change then I've read also Jesus quotes
[1:08:01] from Deuteronomy more than any other
[1:08:03] book in the
[1:08:04] Torah that's how important this book is
[1:08:07] this is a summary of Moses's ministry
[1:08:16] here then we move on Deuteronomy chapter
[1:08:20] 5 to 11 they're really about to Ten
[1:08:24] Commandments and living according to the
[1:08:25] law that Moses brought down from Mount
[1:08:27] Si and it's telling this generation to
[1:08:30] be more faithful and more consecrated
[1:08:33] than the previous
[1:08:36] generation
[1:08:37] um maybe I'll stop right there for a
[1:08:43] minute the young
[1:08:45] people and
[1:08:49] um my kids all of us we look back
[1:08:54] back at previous
[1:08:57] generations and we look boy they lived
[1:09:00] more holy than we live you look at the
[1:09:03] way they dressed you look at their what
[1:09:05] they did as far as their activities you
[1:09:08] look back in the 30s and 40s you know
[1:09:10] what the biggest the the the biggest
[1:09:13] Gatherings of people were back then they
[1:09:16] were Church
[1:09:17] meetings they weren't 100,000 people at
[1:09:20] a Nebraska football
[1:09:22] game they were
[1:09:24] ministers and preachers go and having
[1:09:27] these meetings and the people coming in
[1:09:29] and worshiping the Lord and that's where
[1:09:30] they would meet their husbands and
[1:09:32] that's where they meet their wives now
[1:09:35] look at today and there's very little
[1:09:37] that we have 30 40 50 people here
[1:09:40] tonight that's not the way it was back
[1:09:43] then but it started with entertainment
[1:09:46] with a television and then it then it
[1:09:48] went on to to the internet and and and
[1:09:52] all of this stuff I'm not condemning
[1:09:54] anything but I'm saying that this
[1:09:57] generation here can look back and say
[1:10:01] look how holy they
[1:10:03] were but let me tell you something this
[1:10:07] generation right here needs to be more
[1:10:10] holy because they didn't they didn't
[1:10:13] go they didn't go over Jordan to the
[1:10:16] promised land so we should be more holy
[1:10:20] living a better life than them Daniel if
[1:10:23] I go before the Lord comes you have to
[1:10:27] live a better life than I
[1:10:29] did George you have to live better than
[1:10:33] that generation before cleaner
[1:10:36] Holier and we think how could that be
[1:10:39] but it has to be there will be a
[1:10:43] generation that Witnesses the second
[1:10:45] coming of Christ I pray that it's
[1:10:48] mine I pray brother Eli I want to be
[1:10:51] there I want to see that but if I don't
[1:10:53] attain to that level somebody has to
[1:10:56] it's going to happen and let this
[1:10:58] generation do
[1:11:00] it and don't never look back at that old
[1:11:03] generation and look how holy they were
[1:11:05] because we have to be more than they do
[1:11:09] it's a it's a thought and it's exactly
[1:11:11] what Moses was telling them they're the
[1:11:15] generation that witnessed the Red Sea
[1:11:17] part and all the plagues come down on
[1:11:19] Egypt and Pharaoh Fallen to his knees
[1:11:22] that were the generation witnessed that
[1:11:24] and yet they they failed they sinned and
[1:11:28] the Next Generation rose up was more
[1:11:29] holy than
[1:11:34] them I read this before I want to read
[1:11:36] it again this is a
[1:11:38] shama this is the prayer after Moses
[1:11:42] wrote this in the book of Deuteronomy
[1:11:44] the the the rabbis and the priests they
[1:11:46] started reading this and it's even read
[1:11:50] today very famous prayer daily
[1:11:55] right every day they say this here o
[1:11:59] Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and
[1:12:02] thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
[1:12:04] all thine heart and with all thy soul
[1:12:06] and with all thy
[1:12:07] might and these words which I command
[1:12:10] thee this day shall be in thine heart
[1:12:12] and thou shalt teach them diligently
[1:12:14] unto thy
[1:12:16] children and thou shalt talk of them
[1:12:18] when thou sest in thine house and when
[1:12:21] thou walst by the way and when thou
[1:12:22] liest down when thou riseth up and thou
[1:12:26] shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand
[1:12:29] and they shall be as the F the frontlets
[1:12:32] between thine eyes and thou shalt write
[1:12:34] them upon the posts of thy house thy
[1:12:36] house and on thy
[1:12:38] Gates
[1:12:39] always keep the word of the Lord before
[1:12:42] you and in front of your
[1:12:44] face skip to verse 16 it says
[1:12:47] this ye shall not tempt the Lord your
[1:12:50] God as ye tempted him in Massa ye shall
[1:12:54] diligently keep the Commandments of the
[1:12:56] Lord your God and His testimonies and
[1:12:57] his statutes when he which he hath
[1:13:00] commanded thee and thou shalt do that
[1:13:03] which is right and good in the sight of
[1:13:05] the Lord that it may be well with thee
[1:13:08] and that thou mayest go and possess the
[1:13:10] good land which the Lord swear unto thy
[1:13:13] fathers to cast out all thine enemies
[1:13:16] from before thee as the Lord has spoken
[1:13:19] and when thy son asketh thee in time to
[1:13:22] come saying what mean the testimonies
[1:13:25] and the statutes and the judgments which
[1:13:27] the Lord Our God commanded you then Thou
[1:13:30] shalt say unto thy
[1:13:32] son we were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt
[1:13:36] and the Lord brought us out of Egypt
[1:13:38] with a mighty
[1:13:40] hand and the Lord showed signs and
[1:13:42] wonders great and sore upon Egypt and
[1:13:45] upon pharaoh and upon all his household
[1:13:47] before our eyes and he brought us out
[1:13:50] from then that he may bring us in to
[1:13:53] give us the land which he swear unto our
[1:13:56] fathers and the Lord commanded us to do
[1:13:59] all these statutes to fear the lord Our
[1:14:01] God for our God our for our good always
[1:14:05] that he might preserve Us Alive as it is
[1:14:09] to at this day and it shall be our
[1:14:12] righteousness if we observe to do all
[1:14:15] these Commandments before the Lord Our
[1:14:17] God as he hath commanded us look at this
[1:14:21] law the this
[1:14:23] this walk with the Lord this strict
[1:14:26] lifestyle that we
[1:14:29] live it's for our own
[1:14:32] good as I said before Aaron Gar is
[1:14:37] cruising along at 55 all of the cars are
[1:14:40] going by him something tells him no it's
[1:14:47] 55 and then there's a
[1:14:49] wreck but he was following the law
[1:14:57] chapters 12-
[1:14:58] 16 are a collection of laws in the
[1:15:02] center of book with talking about the
[1:15:04] temple of God in Deuteronomy 14 one
[1:15:08] interesting thing about Deuteronomy 14
[1:15:11] that that uh really blessed me as I was
[1:15:13] reading it talks about tithing and the
[1:15:16] word tithe means a
[1:15:17] tenth so it instructs the people to give
[1:15:21] a tenth of their income come every year
[1:15:24] but then every three
[1:15:27] years take another
[1:15:30] tenth and give it to the
[1:15:33] poor I thought wow I never knew that
[1:15:37] that and and that's that's the way God
[1:15:39] instructed and then that way that every
[1:15:42] year somebody's it's their turn to give
[1:15:46] to the poor so there's always money
[1:15:49] there for the poor to support the poor
[1:15:52] and then their tithing also it's a
[1:15:55] beautiful story and it's it shows that
[1:15:57] even way
[1:15:59] back God was mindful of those that can't
[1:16:02] take care of themselves God was mindful
[1:16:05] of the widows he was mindful of the
[1:16:08] orphans he was mindful of those that
[1:16:11] need help from the
[1:16:14] generosity of the people and in this
[1:16:17] case every three years take another 10%
[1:16:20] and
[1:16:22] give
[1:16:23] I'm not trying to start a
[1:16:25] Doctrine by the way I'm just trying to
[1:16:28] explain the Book of
[1:16:30] Deuteronomy then chapter
[1:16:33] 16 it outlines the character of the
[1:16:36] leadership the elders and the priests
[1:16:38] they were all placed within the
[1:16:39] authority of the law and then it says
[1:16:42] that he will send prophets to make sure
[1:16:45] that these laws are being
[1:16:48] followed these future prophets they'll
[1:16:52] be like Moses
[1:16:53] and they'll set things straight not only
[1:16:57] with the the priesthood they'll set
[1:16:58] things straight with the government
[1:17:02] morally and throughout everyone these
[1:17:04] prophets will show up on the scene and
[1:17:06] cry out against
[1:17:08] sin Deuteronomy 18:13 very very
[1:17:11] important scripture right
[1:17:13] here Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord
[1:17:17] thy God for these nations which which
[1:17:19] Thou shalt possess hearken under The
[1:17:22] Observers of time and unto divers but as
[1:17:25] for thee the Lord thy God hath not
[1:17:27] suffered thee to do so so he says don't
[1:17:30] get caught up with these false prophets
[1:17:33] and these wi Wizards and these Witch
[1:17:35] Doctors the Lord thy God will raise up
[1:17:38] unto thee a prophet from the midst of
[1:17:40] thee of thy Brethren like unto me unto
[1:17:46] him you shall
[1:17:48] hearken according to all that thou
[1:17:51] desirest of the Lord thy God in Horeb in
[1:17:54] the day of the assembly saying let me
[1:17:57] not hear again the voice of the Lord my
[1:17:59] God neither let me see this great fire
[1:18:02] anymore that I die not remember when
[1:18:05] they were at the mountain and they got
[1:18:08] scared because of all the noise and all
[1:18:10] the fire and everything they said don't
[1:18:12] let God
[1:18:14] speak we want to hear a
[1:18:17] prophet God never forgave him for
[1:18:20] that but from that point on and here's
[1:18:22] what Moses is saying from that point
[1:18:26] on God spoke
[1:18:29] through these
[1:18:32] prophets and the Lord said unto me they
[1:18:35] have well spoken that which they which
[1:18:38] which they have spoken I will raise them
[1:18:41] up a prophet from among their Brethren
[1:18:43] like unto thee and I will pour my words
[1:18:45] in his mouth and he shall speak unto
[1:18:48] them all that I shall command him
[1:18:54] do you know what he's talking
[1:18:56] about let's turn to
[1:18:59] acts he's talking about the future
[1:19:01] prophets but let's turn to Acts chapter
[1:19:04] 3 verse
[1:19:06] 18 believe this is Peter
[1:19:17] speaking says this but those things
[1:19:21] which God before had sh by the mouth of
[1:19:23] All His prophets that Christ should
[1:19:27] suffer he has so
[1:19:30] fulfilled repent ye therefore and be
[1:19:32] converted that your sins may be blotted
[1:19:34] out when the times of refreshing shall
[1:19:36] come from the presence of the Lord and
[1:19:38] He Shall send Jesus
[1:19:41] Christ which before was preached to you
[1:19:44] what does Peter mean
[1:19:48] before it means a long time
[1:19:51] before whom the Heaven Must receive
[1:19:54] until the times of restitution of all
[1:19:56] things which God hath spoken by the
[1:19:58] mouth of all his holy prophets since the
[1:20:01] world began so all these prophets every
[1:20:03] Prophet that ever lived was talking
[1:20:05] about the same
[1:20:08] thing for Moses now we're GNA hear what
[1:20:14] I just said in
[1:20:16] Deuteronomy Peter says this for Moses
[1:20:18] said unto the fathers a prophet shall
[1:20:23] the Lord your God raise up unto you of
[1:20:26] your brethren like unto me him shall ye
[1:20:30] hear in all things whatsoever he shall
[1:20:32] say unto you and it shall come to pass
[1:20:36] that every soul which will not hear that
[1:20:38] Prophet shall be destroyed from among
[1:20:40] the people yay and all the prophets from
[1:20:43] Samuel and those that follow after as
[1:20:46] many as have spoken have likewise
[1:20:48] foretold of these days so Peter is
[1:20:51] saying that all the prophets in
[1:20:52] including Moses are talking about the
[1:20:55] time when this man Jesus Christ would
[1:20:58] come ye are the children of the prophets
[1:21:00] and of the Covenant which God made with
[1:21:02] our fathers saying unto Abraham and thy
[1:21:05] seed and in thy seed shall all the
[1:21:07] kindreds of the earth be blessed unto
[1:21:10] unto F unto you first God having raised
[1:21:13] up his son Jesus sent him to bless you
[1:21:17] and turning away every one of you from
[1:21:20] his
[1:21:21] iniquities Peter is saying that Christ
[1:21:24] first came to Moses's people Abraham's
[1:21:27] people Israel's people the
[1:21:31] Jews now let's go back to Deuteronomy
[1:21:34] chapter 18 beautiful how Moses
[1:21:38] prophesied of this man Jesus that was to
[1:21:41] come verse uh Deuteronomy 18:19 and it
[1:21:45] shall come to pass now now Moses is
[1:21:47] speaking again and it shall come to pass
[1:21:49] that whosoever will not hearken unto my
[1:21:51] words which shall which he shall speak
[1:21:53] in my name I will required of it him so
[1:21:56] he's saying listen to the prophets or
[1:21:58] else you're going to answer for it
[1:22:01] but this is very important that Prophet
[1:22:04] must be a true
[1:22:06] Prophet but the prophet which shall
[1:22:08] presumed to speak a word in my name
[1:22:11] which I have not commanded him to speak
[1:22:14] or that shall speak in the name of other
[1:22:16] gods even the prophet even that Prophet
[1:22:19] shall die so the stakes are very high in
[1:22:21] this Old Testament
[1:22:25] and if thou sh thou say in thine heart
[1:22:29] how shall we know the word of the Lord
[1:22:32] hath not how shall we know the word
[1:22:36] which the Lord hath not spoken a very
[1:22:38] very important
[1:22:40] question so if somebody's
[1:22:42] prophesying a man is claiming to be a
[1:22:45] prophet how do we know he is or isn't no
[1:22:50] matter how good of a Preacher he is some
[1:22:52] of them are are some of the greatest
[1:22:54] preachers around no matter even doesn't
[1:22:57] even say if he's doing Miracles or
[1:22:59] whatever he's doing how do we know that
[1:23:02] this man that's prophesying is or isn't
[1:23:05] a
[1:23:08] prophet when a prophet speaketh in the
[1:23:10] name of the
[1:23:11] Lord if the thing follow not nor come to
[1:23:17] pass that is the thing which the Lord
[1:23:19] hath not spoken but if the Prophet hath
[1:23:23] spoken it presumptuous Thou shalt not be
[1:23:27] afraid of
[1:23:28] him so if a so-called Prophet man with a
[1:23:31] prophetic gift speaks a prophecy and it
[1:23:35] doesn't come to
[1:23:36] pass then don't believe him and
[1:23:40] Friends remember that probably many of
[1:23:44] us have seen that
[1:23:46] happen no matter as I said no matter how
[1:23:48] great of a Preacher he is no matter how
[1:23:51] much charisma he has no matter what his
[1:23:54] ministry how can he how he can explain
[1:23:58] the word if he
[1:24:00] prophesize and it doesn't come to pass
[1:24:04] it says don't be afraid of that man and
[1:24:07] many of those men they rule with
[1:24:11] fear they say listen to me they may even
[1:24:15] call themselves a prophet or others will
[1:24:17] call him a prophet but if he says
[1:24:19] something that doesn't come to pass
[1:24:21] don't be afraid of that and there's
[1:24:25] there's all kinds of those out there
[1:24:27] right now but if that prophecy doesn't
[1:24:30] come to
[1:24:32] pass then everything else really is out
[1:24:36] the
[1:24:37] window chapters 19-
[1:24:40] 26 laws about marriage family widows
[1:24:43] orphans businesses all kinds of everyday
[1:24:46] life also more laws about
[1:24:49] worship and again these laws they
[1:24:52] separate they set Israel apart from the
[1:24:55] rest of the world so when they go over
[1:24:58] into Canaan land they're going to be
[1:25:00] amongst a bunch of idolators they're
[1:25:03] going to be a bunch of among a bunch of
[1:25:05] just worldly people that don't have
[1:25:07] values and he's saying that this is what
[1:25:10] separates you from those
[1:25:14] people then 27 through 34 Moses Moses
[1:25:18] issues a challenge to Israel to listen
[1:25:21] to and and to love
[1:25:24] God
[1:25:26] and I'll I'll skip down to
[1:25:30] um 30 chapter
[1:25:34] 30
[1:25:38] and Moses says really just a beautiful
[1:25:43] thing
[1:25:45] here he
[1:25:47] says that no matter how bad you've done
[1:25:52] no matter how bad you've sinned no
[1:25:54] matter how much you've failed that God
[1:25:57] will restore if you will just surrender
[1:26:00] to him de Deuteronomy chapter 30 it says
[1:26:03] this and it shall come to pass when all
[1:26:06] these things are come upon thee the
[1:26:08] blessing and the curse which I have set
[1:26:11] before thee and that thou shalt call
[1:26:13] them to mind among all the nations
[1:26:16] whether the Lord thy God hath driven
[1:26:18] thee and shall return unto the Lord thy
[1:26:21] God and shall obey his voice according
[1:26:24] to all that I command thee this day thou
[1:26:27] and thy children with all thine heart
[1:26:29] and with all thy Soul so once you've
[1:26:31] suffered all these
[1:26:33] curses you're going to come back and
[1:26:36] you're going to obey the Lord your God
[1:26:39] and then the Lord thy God will turn thy
[1:26:41] captivity and have compassion upon thee
[1:26:44] and will return and gather thee from All
[1:26:47] Nations whether the Lord thy God ha
[1:26:49] scattered
[1:26:51] thee and if thine and if any of thine be
[1:26:55] driven out of the outmost parts of
[1:26:56] Heaven from then will the Lord God
[1:26:59] gather thee and from then he will fetch
[1:27:01] thee so the the love of God no matter
[1:27:04] how far Israel goes the Lord the Lord's
[1:27:08] going to go get go get them and the Lord
[1:27:11] thy God will bring thee into the land
[1:27:13] which thy fathers possess and thou shalt
[1:27:15] possess it and he will do thee good and
[1:27:19] multiply thee above thy fathers and the
[1:27:22] Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart
[1:27:25] and the Heart of thy seed to love the
[1:27:28] Lord thy God with all thine heart and
[1:27:30] with all thy soul that thou mayest live
[1:27:34] and the Lord thy God will put all these
[1:27:36] curses upon thy enemies and upon them
[1:27:38] that hate thee which persecute thee so
[1:27:41] now he's talking about he's talking
[1:27:43] about Israel and he say he says you're
[1:27:44] going to
[1:27:46] fail you're going to go into captivity
[1:27:48] maybe into
[1:27:49] Babylon or you're going to go and you're
[1:27:52] going to be spread throughout the world
[1:27:54] as happened about 2,000 years ago and
[1:27:56] you're going to go to Germany and you're
[1:27:58] going to go to Russia and you're going
[1:28:00] to go to
[1:28:01] Ukraine but the Lord's going to bring
[1:28:04] you
[1:28:05] back and he's going to fight against all
[1:28:08] of your enemies Hezbollah and Hamas Iran
[1:28:13] and all those who hate Israel right
[1:28:14] here's a promise that he's going to
[1:28:16] fight for them and thou shalt return and
[1:28:18] obey the voice of the Lord and do all
[1:28:20] his
[1:28:21] Commandments

[1:32:32] Excellency and thine enemies shall be
[1:32:34] found Liars unto thee and thou shalt
[1:32:37] tread upon their high
[1:32:39] places now in closing if uh the
[1:32:43] musicians would
[1:32:46] come I um I don't know why that uh
[1:32:52] things went the way that they did
[1:32:55] tonight
[1:32:57] um I wanted wanted to read as much as
[1:33:02] the scripture as I could because we know
[1:33:04] that our words will fail but if we can
[1:33:07] read our Bibles that those are God's
[1:33:10] words and God blesses his word and these
[1:33:15] last this last chapter of
[1:33:18] Deuteronomy it's probably not written
[1:33:20] it's not written by Moses
[1:33:22] but it is written probably by his
[1:33:25] contemporary Joshua and the man that
[1:33:27] would take the message and take the
[1:33:29] people and go over Jordan into God's
[1:33:33] Promised Land it says
[1:33:34] this chapter 34 and Moses went up from
[1:33:37] The Plains of Moab into the mountain of
[1:33:40] Nebo to the top of pisga that is over
[1:33:43] against Jericho and the Lord showed him
[1:33:46] all the lands of Gilead unto Dan and all
[1:33:50] Nepali and the land of of Ephraim and
[1:33:52] Manasseh and all the land of Judah unto
[1:33:55] the utmost sea and and the South and the
[1:33:58] plain of the valley of Jericho the city
[1:34:00] of palm trees unto zor and the Lord said
[1:34:03] unto him this is the land which I swear
[1:34:05] unto Abraham and to Isaac and unto Jacob
[1:34:08] saying I will give unto thy seed I have
[1:34:11] caused thee to set it with thine eyes
[1:34:15] but Thou shalt not go over
[1:34:18] tither so Moses the servant of the Lord
[1:34:22] died there in the land of Moab according
[1:34:25] to the word of the
[1:34:27] Lord and he buried him in a valley in
[1:34:30] the land of Moab over against bethor but
[1:34:34] no man knoweth of his supplier unto this
[1:34:37] day even Lucifer even Satan himself
[1:34:42] doesn't know where Moses was
[1:34:44] buried it says right here that God
[1:34:47] buried his servant
[1:34:48] Moses imagine he goes up on that
[1:34:50] mountain
[1:34:54] and had a
[1:34:56] time with the Lord the old man walked
[1:35:01] up I wonder what
[1:35:05] happened
[1:35:07] God he couldn't go over
[1:35:10] Jordan he goes over in private and this
[1:35:14] greatest Prophet that's in the entire
[1:35:16] Old Testament did more than anyone else
[1:35:20] had done
[1:35:22] he had just
[1:35:23] given his ending
[1:35:26] sermons to these
[1:35:28] people this next Generation the first
[1:35:32] generation had died out and he goes gave
[1:35:36] it everything that he
[1:35:37] had and he goes to be with the
[1:35:42] Lord and the Lord
[1:35:44] himself buried
[1:35:48] Moses and Moses was 120 years old when
[1:35:51] he died
[1:35:52] died his eye was not dim nor his natural
[1:35:56] force
[1:35:57] abated and the children of Israel wept
[1:36:00] for Moses in the plains of Moab 30 days
[1:36:03] so that the days of weeping and mourning
[1:36:05] for Moses were ended and Joshua the son
[1:36:08] of nun was full of the spirit of wisdom
[1:36:11] for Moses had laid his hands upon him
[1:36:14] and the children of Israel hearkened
[1:36:16] unto him and did as the Lord commanded
[1:36:20] Moses
[1:36:22] and there arose not a prophet since
[1:36:24] since in Israel like unto
[1:36:26] Moses whom the Lord knew face to
[1:36:29] face and all the signs and the Wonders
[1:36:33] which the Lord sent him to do in the
[1:36:35] land of Egypt to pharaoh and to all his
[1:36:38] servants and all his land in all that
[1:36:42] Mighty hand and in the great Terror
[1:36:45] which Moses showed in the sight of
[1:36:50] Israel
[1:36:52] I uh I don't think I
[1:36:55] know that even Satan
[1:36:58] himself he
[1:37:00] hates these words of
[1:37:03] Moses and he attacks against anyone who
[1:37:08] would read these blessed scriptures that
[1:37:13] have carried for thousands of years to
[1:37:16] this day and friends this Old Testament
[1:37:18] of the book of the law it's just as true
[1:37:21] today as it was the day it was
[1:37:24] written Moses this great man and all
[1:37:27] that he
[1:37:30] did right here it all ended up on that
[1:37:37] mountain and this
[1:37:40] concludes the Torah this concludes the
[1:37:43] first five books of the Bible this
[1:37:46] concludes the
[1:37:48] um writings of Moses
[1:37:52] it's quoted probably is the most talked
[1:37:55] about Prophet even today that has ever
[1:37:57] lived and um I got to tell you his his
[1:38:03] message
[1:38:07] is if people would live if they would
[1:38:09] have just lived by Moses's message and
[1:38:12] really done what he taught they wouldn't
[1:38:14] have had all the troubles that they
[1:38:16] had
[1:38:18] so again friends I uh
[1:38:23] felt like something was going on tonight
[1:38:25] that I don't know what it was I I know
[1:38:27] I've never said that before as you know
[1:38:30] um but I pray that you got something out
[1:38:34] of the
[1:38:35] closing of of
[1:38:37] God's word and these writings of
[1:38:42] Moses it's a closing as I said before
[1:38:46] Deuteronomy it wasn't anything
[1:38:48] new it was Moses re re iterating what he
[1:38:52] had already said and what he had already
[1:38:53] taught before and this was a series of
[1:38:55] sermons that he preached to try to get
[1:38:57] the people to live for the Lord and to
[1:39:00] be right amen you believe Moses's words
[1:39:05] you believe every word that's in this
[1:39:08] book brother George what do you want to
[1:39:13] do you still
[1:39:15] feel you still feel to go up
[1:39:17] here let me tell you brother George
[1:39:21] never met before we talked on the phone
[1:39:23] earlier
[1:39:24] today and
[1:39:27] um he he said
[1:39:29] that he had it in his mind if I'm
[1:39:33] right that if I mentioned baptism to
[1:39:36] him that he knew that that would be the
[1:39:40] step that he would take tonight and it
[1:39:42] was one of the first things I mentioned
[1:39:44] to him brother George is a Christian I
[1:39:47] can tell he's a Christian I can tell
[1:39:49] brother George has had an exper
[1:39:51] experience in his life and he told me as
[1:39:54] we were out there talking he said did
[1:39:56] you say something like this would be the
[1:39:59] final step this is this was this
[1:40:03] completes that
[1:40:04] journey and it does friends there is a
[1:40:08] time we we need to all come through that
[1:40:10] journey and as Moses said in this book
[1:40:13] he said God will circumcise your
[1:40:17] heart this outward
[1:40:19] circumcision it was a type of the real
[1:40:23] thing which is cutting off the flesh the
[1:40:25] extra flesh of this heart and really
[1:40:29] serving God with all everything that's
[1:40:32] in us that we may be a pure and willing
[1:40:36] vessel for God's spirit to enter into
[1:40:40] our lives and then that law that I just
[1:40:44] read about becomes
[1:40:47] flesh walking talking word of God God
[1:40:52] the word and the person becomes
[1:40:55] one baptism brother George is such an
[1:40:59] important part of that the Apostle
[1:41:04] Peter he commanded he knew that this
[1:41:07] baptism that it was something that had
[1:41:10] been a tradition in the Jewish culture
[1:41:13] that this baptism meant that they were
[1:41:16] going that they were going to repent and
[1:41:18] make a change in their lives and this
[1:41:21] John the Baptist came the Forerunner of
[1:41:23] Jesus Christ he came to introduce Christ
[1:41:27] and he goes out there and he is
[1:41:29] baptizing in this Jordan River and and
[1:41:32] the people saw hey there's something
[1:41:34] about this
[1:41:36] guy why are you baptizing why do the
[1:41:39] people
[1:41:41] repent it's because he was a
[1:41:44] prophet and then Jesus comes into the
[1:41:48] water with John John baptizes him and he
[1:41:53] comes out and then the Holy Spirit comes
[1:41:56] down and
[1:41:57] rests upon the Messiah and then he goes
[1:42:00] into the Wilderness for 40
[1:42:03] days and that's the same in our baptism
[1:42:07] Peter was recalling all of these things
[1:42:10] and he filled with the Holy Spirit the
[1:42:12] day of Pentecost had just come and the
[1:42:14] Holy Spirit was living inside of Peter
[1:42:17] the book as I said became real and now
[1:42:20] living in a man and it wasn't just
[1:42:22] studying it it wasn't just learning it
[1:42:24] and regurgitating what you had learned
[1:42:26] now it became real to
[1:42:29] Peter and He commands the people in Acts
[1:42:33] chapter
[1:42:35] 2 I can quote it I don't need to read
[1:42:40] it but if you could put it up on the on
[1:42:42] the screen acts chap 2:
[1:42:47] 38 says this Now 37 says that when Peter
[1:42:53] had preached this Jesus Christ they had
[1:42:55] they were cut in their
[1:42:57] hearts said there's something real about
[1:43:00] what this man is
[1:43:02] preaching and then they go to Peter and
[1:43:05] they said what was must we
[1:43:08] do Peter says
[1:43:11] this and he said it to all of them he
[1:43:13] said repent every one of
[1:43:16] you and be
[1:43:18] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:43:20] Christ for the remission of your sins
[1:43:23] the remission of your sins means the
[1:43:25] taking away of your sins and then you
[1:43:29] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:43:33] Ghost it's a promise that you will
[1:43:36] receive this same gift that we had in
[1:43:40] the upper
[1:43:41] room and he had just come out of the
[1:43:43] upper room and now was preaching it
[1:43:46] verse
[1:43:47] 39 says for This Promise is unto you and
[1:43:50] to your children and them that are far
[1:43:53] off even as many as the Lord Our God
[1:43:55] shall call George that's you and that's
[1:43:58] me it wasn't just for them 2,000 years
[1:44:01] ago it's for you and me that we can go
[1:44:03] into this pool and be baptized in the
[1:44:06] name of Jesus Christ with the power of
[1:44:08] Jesus
[1:44:09] Christ and then a
[1:44:12] promise that this Spirit as it did that
[1:44:15] the day of Pentecost would come into us
[1:44:18] as it did to them and then we would be
[1:44:20] set aside side for
[1:44:21] service to preach this gospel to witness
[1:44:25] of this gospel to live this gospel as
[1:44:27] Moses had instructed these people in the
[1:44:30] wilderness he said go and live it live
[1:44:32] this law live this law and don't make
[1:44:35] any mistakes it was impossible for them
[1:44:37] to do it before but now because of
[1:44:40] Christ has come now it is possible to
[1:44:43] live that same law that Moses taught
[1:44:47] this day it's possible brother if if you
[1:44:50] could uh meet brother Lyall back there
[1:44:53] just go right back there brother Lyall
[1:44:54] will show you where to go and I will
[1:44:56] come up and meet you up there brothers
[1:44:59] and
[1:45:02] sisters just for one
[1:45:05] minute God is so good he is
[1:45:10] great he commanded us to live this
[1:45:14] word and we can't do
[1:45:17] it the law just reading the law and
[1:45:20] trying to live every word we can't do it
[1:45:23] until that Spirit comes into us that
[1:45:26] Holy Spirit and then we live it and then
[1:45:29] we can do it and then when we fail it's
[1:45:32] like Lord I failed and he says I
[1:45:35] know but he looks and he says you didn't
[1:45:39] fail there was somebody who failed that
[1:45:42] took your failures over here and he
[1:45:45] answered for it that perfect sacrifice
[1:45:48] and that is God's word word that is made
[1:45:51] flesh within us that we might live this
[1:45:56] word God bless you brothers and
