trees they're still here today choose you this day whom you will serve I'm so glad God give me Grace to choose the right path there are two roads you can take one by side one by faith take the word of

on up and get ready uh some of you were there last night got to hear Brother Nehemiah sing and hear him testify and it was wonderful I'd just like to tell the story about how we met um uh we've talked a little bit about brother Bobby and his his vision here for Harmony and all that he did over the years to get Harmony going well Katie and I were having lunch with brother Bobby on a Sunday afternoon and if you've ever had lunch with brother Bobby you know he just talks to everyone a lot the people serving him he he talks to him asks them what they do not just surface level he tries to get in deep conversation with everyone he sees people would walk by and he'd make eye contact and he'd just start talking to them so we were out in front of the restaurant it was cheddar over on Broadway and uh brother Nehemiah walked out and turned and it was like him and brother Bobby were best friends like they'd never they'd never seen each other never met and like in front of Cheddars I think we started singing and brother Nehemiah came to church here that night and since then he's been a wonderful friend and when when I when we talked with brother Daniel and heard we're doing Harmony I said we have to have brother Nehemiah come sing so he's got a couple songs for us tonight God bless you God bless you too brother I don't understand how anybody in this world cannot want to feel what we are

Harmony I want to say that it's nice I met a lot of new people and uh a lot of old faces that are dear to our hearts it's good it's good to come together it's good to come together and worship I want to mention also brother Bobby today's his birthday brother Bobby we love you and there is something powerful about coming together and singing we might not think it we might think well there's power in prayer and there is power in prayer and there's power in the word and there is power in the word but there is power in a song There's two men I'll tell a story there was two men their names were Paul and Silas Paul and Silas for they were preaching the gospel and they took them they beat them they beat him almost to death and then they they Paul and Silas wouldn't give up what they believed so they took them and they they took they they put their feet in stocks and their hands in stocks in ch s and they took them and put them all the way to the center of the prison not just on the on one cell but they took them and they put them all the way in the middle and there they are maybe in the dark Paul and Silas two brothers in the gospel as we are brothers and sisters in the gospel here loving the lord and there they are they're bruised they're beaten enchant s and what did they do they began to sing what songs did they sing let me see our list Winds of Faith Palms of Victory believe for it didn't I walk on the water water they start singing these songs praising the Lord and the Bible says that everyone in the prison they started listening all of the prisoners they started listening to Paul and Silas singing these songs and the Holy Spirit must have come in we know it came in because the Earth began to shake and the doors of the cells began to open up and the the chains that were on their feet and the chains were on their hands they all broke off because they were singing brother Nehemiah they were singing a song and they were praising all the stalks were off and all the doors of the cell were open the Jailer came and he sees he sees the doors are open and he sees and and all everything's loose and he takes his sword he puts it there and he's going to fall on his sword because he knew that he would surely be put to death for letting all of these prisoners escape and as he put that sword to his him his bosom he hears brother Paul cry out do yourself no harm brother stop we're all here all of us are here brother minnow it wasn't just Paul and Silas that were there these songs these are all criminals these are all prisoners and these songs converted everybody in the jail so they didn't leave imagine a prisoner the doors open they'd be out but they all stayed they all stayed and worshiped with Paul and Silas look at the power of a song it converted these Sinners that were in the jail and the Jailer looks and he says they're all here and what does he say the power of a song what does he say he said Brothers how can I be saved Paul looks at him and he says believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and he didn't just stop he says believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you and your family will be saved how wonderful all from a song we take it lightly we come to we come to church we worship we've had Harmony in the desert we've had three days of worshiping what power is in our voices As we sing brother minow there is power there is power in these things and let me tell you when we sing We Sing in the name of the Lord Jesus when we pray we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus when we get up in the morning we get up in the name of the Lord Jesus when we go to bed we go to bed in the name of the Lord Jesus and you watch the Power of Jesus Christ not only in US it'll take our these bonds they may be sin the bonds it may be a job it may be sickness it may be cancer whatever it is the walls will shake when we begin to sing if we have that same faith that the apostles Paul and Silas had I speak [Music] Jesus let's all stand and let's

spirit it said in but a few years ago I met brother Daniel here in this church maybe two years ago I think when we had Harmony here and the growth I've seen as he's begin to relax in his ministry in his calling it was a new thing for you yeah and I've just seen such tremendous growth and I I hope you take that in the right Spirit of that that just seeing him relax in his ministry the the the comments and the way he's LED these these meetings has been just tremendous and there's another one standing behind me here are you there Joey I'm going to stop calling them Joey you know I think I

you know when you have a student in grade six you have no idea what's there it's just all potential he was actually Joey then he was like a little kangaroo but but uh you know Josiah I'm just so thrilled to see where God has taken you and as I was listening to the young people singing all through these meetings and just seeing young people that um brother Caleb's daughter singing you know it's cool to be uncool just stand up and make a stand and says see all of you young people declaring your faith in God and living for God you know what I felt through the whole thing thing the future of the church is secure that's right come on because we've seen young people born again filled with the Holy Ghost and you know sometimes we worry what about the future I'm not worried about the future because I see a whole crop coming up that's just pushing forward pushing forward and you know those of us who are getting a little long on the tooth well we're just thanking God for that that
