take your seats it's good to see everyone in the house of the Lord tonight brother Jerry I believe that we have met before before I saw you I saw you on the video praying and and I I've met you before and I can't remember exactly where but but brother it's good to have you than thank you for joining us tonight what we have tonight what we've been doing really over the past year is we've been just digging into the scriptures and usually on Wednesday night we started a Bible study and we started it with book of Acts and we went through chapter by chapter line by line and we read every single word in the book of Acts and and we learned what was going on there and I felt it upon my heart to start in the book of Genesis and let's just go through the whole Bible and the plan is to give just an overview of each book so that we can know what this Bible says what it's about we won't w't be able to dig in very deep uh like we did the book of Acts but we want to know every what what's in each book and we started with Genesis we split Genesis into two the plan is to get through with the Old Testament by this time next year but I believe it was it was either Dwight Eisenhower or Winston Churchill one of those great generals one of those great leaders he said that you plan and when you finally get to the battle he said the plan is worthless he said but the planning is priceless and that's how I feel with with the church and and with what we're doing is I'm always willing to change directions and I want to I want to plan well I want to pray and and praying about about which direction to go and and studying and the planning will be Priceless no matter what but the plan we can always deviate and I'm always ready if the Lord leads a different way I'm always ready ready to change so we started brother Lyall and I split Genesis up into into two um two different Services then brother Lyle had Exodus and I'll tell you the Bible is is a very very exciting book and you get to the you you start in the book of Genesis and and wow it's a great book to start with because you start in God creates the Heaven and the Earth and then you see the Holy Spirit Come on the scene right at the beginning and it moves across the face of the deep and we see that each day God creates the different things and and and how he separates the light from the darkness and and he just builds this beautiful place called the Earth and this especially beautiful place called Eden and he sets his son there and his son is naming all of the animals and then and then he sees that his son is alone and he wants to provide him with with a helpmate and he gives him a wife and then we see that this mysterious creature comes in and and it's the serpent and and the book just keeps getting more exciting and we see time go on we see that first sacrifice there in the Garden of Eden when God killed this animal and made skins for them to cover themselves and we see as time goes on we see they're building cities and then we see the the ark we this man named Noah this Prophet goes and he builts builds this giant Ark and he brings all the animals in and and the animals are saved and then they they get out and then this this man named Abraham comes along the seene and God promises him he doesn't have any children God promises you're going to have children children and you're going to have more children look up at the stars there's going to be as many children as the stars of the sky or as the sand of the sea and he was he and his wife were both Barren so we see this amazing thing and we see that he has these two sons and he goes and he he wants to he's following God's orders he's going to kill one and it just builds and builds and builds and we see the 12 Patriarchs come and we see the last one Joseph come and then there's 400 years of Gap and then we see Exodus start and it is just as exciting we see a little boy and we see how this little boy is is they're killing all the babies and in put in this Nile and there's crocodiles and and there's all kinds of things going on and the pharaoh's sister takes him out of the out of there and raises him at his as his own as her own and he becomes almost to where he becomes king and then he sacrifices it all for his own people what a hero and he goes into exile for 40 years and then God talks to him in this Burning Bush and he comes back and delivers the people and man there's plagues and there's there's all kinds of things going on and and he brings the people out of slavery and they go to this big ocean in the water parts and they go across and then they're hungry and God Reigns mana and then there's a pillar of fire show up and a pillar of cloud and then they build this Tabernacle and and then and then it all ends it's so exciting and then we get to the Book of Leviticus it's like what what is this very different book I remember I was on the the last time I think I believe it was the eighth time and it's the last time I read my Bible all the way through and I got same thing I was just loving Genesis loving Exodus and I finished Exodus and I got to Leviticus and I said Lord I've read this book seven times and I said I always get to this book and I just read it to get through it and I I said Lord would you give me something would you help me to want to read this would you show me something so I'm excited to read this book and God answered my prayers and I started in the Book of Leviticus and it became an incredible incredible book to me it was it was uh what I saw and what is so incredible about this book and this is what the Lord revealed to me and what made it so wonderful is from the start to the finish the Lord showed us Jesus Christ in the whole book I believe more than any other book in the whole Bible especially in the Old Testament we see Christ described in detail it metaphorically through through rituals and through customs and and through sacrifices and feast days it's all about Jesus and I got to tell you I Lov this book and then I got to the end I was like oh man it's over that was great so in getting into this book I think the key is that we understand the reason that it was written now it happens in just a a short period of time but the ly ended and we're at Mount Si with all of the Hebrews that had come out of Egypt and they're camped there at this mountain Moses goes up and he gets this thing called the law Ten Commandments he comes back down they they had they built this Tabernacle in the wilderness and they Moses had these stones and they they had built this thing called The Ark which is this box and they they they bring it in there and then the book ends right there and they're right here at the foot of this mountain for about 11 and a half months and this law that was started with the Ten Commandments The Book of Leviticus is all about all about the law and it's all about explaining to the people people how they can get closer to God so the question in this book the main question as we're going through Leviticus is how do we enter into the presence of God we had the sermon this morning about how the rich man was in hell and there was a gulf between him and God over here in Abraham and that that Gulf that Gulf couldn't be crossed that Gulf was sin and This Book of Leviticus IT addresses the sin and then this God if God is Holy then the space around him is Holy and to enter into that space we need to live a holy life and that is what the Book of Leviticus is about and how do we enter into the presence of God God is to use a metaphor here God's kind of like the sun if you get to close to him you're going to burn up you can't get too close to him physically but if you get too far away from him then you're going to freeze to death so what this book is doing this book is showing us how to get in his presence showing the Hebrews how to get in his presence and stay in that area and you're going to see what happens if you get too close to him and you're certainly going to see what happens if you get too far from him and then you're going to see what happens if you disrespect him and it's every when we get too far away from him it's that coldness that we get and it's be we become worldly it's like everyday life and we just go through the motions and the world Creeps in and all of a sudden we find that we are far far away from God and Leviticus is written to keep us to keep the Hebrews close remember they're at the bottom they're at the foot of Mount Si there now as far as getting too close to God it's like well brother Daniel what are you talking about we want to get as close to God as we can and that's true but there's a story in the Bible about Moses and Moses in the book of Exodus Moses had a desire to see God you remember the story and God said stand up here on a rock God agrees Moses wants to see the glory wants to see God and God tells him listen you can't see me and he says these words he says that if any man sees me no man can see me and live so he says but you can see my glory so Moses stands on the Rock and the glory of the Lord passes and Moses catches a glimpse of his back but even Moses the prophet he couldn't look God right in the face because it wasn't possible for the human flesh to have that or you would die it's strange I know I don't understand it it's but it's it's the way that that God is and it's the same like with looking at the sun we can look at the Sun and we can go blind but we can every day enjoy the benefits of the sun enjoy its warmth enjoy its light but we don't want to take it too far and just stare at the sun because it will hurt us basically This Book of Leviticus is meant to bring the Hebrews Hebrews into fellowship with God now as you read it and I encourage the congregation is always to read your Bible and read this book you will see this word that keeps repeating itself and it's called holy holy just means to be set apart God is set set apart and if God is Holy then the space around God is Holy so if Israel wanted to live in the presence of God then they needed to be holy like God is Holy the beginning of the book and the end of the book are descriptions of the ordinances and the rituals that they need to practice and in the middle of the book it's about the priests and how they need to be especially holy because they are to be mediators between God and the people there's five main types of sacrifices in The Book of Leviticus two of those sacrifices were meant for gratitude for God's blessings they're not required but they were given by the people to God then three of those sacrifices of those five main sacrifices were designed for repentance basically for saying sorry for what they have have done here the Jew would offer an animal while confessing that the sacrifice is in the place of their sin now remember this is 1500 years before Christ but every sacrifice for atonement that word atonement will keep coming up that word atonement is a very important word and it basically just means compensation just payment but the atonement is that animal taking the place of The Sinner and and then God's Wrath is stayed and the ultimate goal in the sacrifice is to be G be forgiven for these sins so that's what this book is about and through these rituals also the congregation is constantly being reminded of the goodness and the mercy of God and then the next set of rituals that the that the book goes through is our seven annual feasts and these each of these feasts retell a story about how God God brought them out of slavery I just talked about Exodus how God brought them out of slavery and then brought them into the Wilderness on the way to the promised land and by retelling the story it reminds the people about the goodness of God and they have what's what's called these feast days and they're basically like holidays and they tell the story of of the goodness of God and how much he has protected him we just went through a um a holiday called Thanksgiving now Thanksgiving is when we look back or we should we look back when the pilgrims came over and then they finally um they lost half their people and they finally were were helped by the Indians and then they had a feast and the Thanksgiving story tells that story and this is these feast days are kind of like that they're meant to retail and to remember what God has done for the people Leviticus chapter 1 we'll start with verse one and we'll just we'll read a couple places in Leviticus to kind of give you a feeling of the book Leviticus 1:1 says this and the Lord called unto Moses and spake unto him out of the Tabernacle of the congregation now the Tabernacle of the congregation you've seen brother Lyall has put some some pictures up of the Tabernacle it's basically there's there there was a courtyard around a fence there was a an altar a bronze altar um for the burnt offerings that's in the Middle where where they make animal sacrifices and then there was a basin to to do the ceremonial washing and then there was a 15 about a 15 by 45t structure that um was was this tent and it was it was movable it was uh it was meant to be able to to fold up and then take to the next place because they were out in the wilderness and then in the inner area there was about a 15 by 30 foot chamber and that was the place that contained the shoe bread and and uh the the ordinances there and then there was a small 15 about 15x 15ft chamber which was the most holy place and that was where the ark was and then there was the ark and and um they had a there was a mercy seat and inside was Aaron's rod and uh the tablets of stone and and a a bowl of Mana that were in there so that's what when that first scripture God is speaking out from this place and he says speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them if any man man of you bring an offering unto the Lord you shall bring your offering of the cattle even of the herd and of the flock if his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd let him offer a male without blemish he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord and he shall put his hand on the head of the burnt offering and it shall be accepted for him to make an atonement for him so this man is putting his hand on the head of this burnt offering obviously it's not burnt yet it's still it's still alive and symbolically passing his sins onto that animal and he shall kill the bulock before the Lord and the priests Aaron's sons shall bring the blood and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the Tabernacle with the congregation now we have an image of our mind in our mind of the Tabernacle and the Wilderness but many times this was a very bloody place it was a place that had had taken they taken animals and cut their throats cutting up the animals and and it must have been at certain times there's probably just blood everywhere rough a rough place and then they would cook parts of these animals and what was amazing to me is I've always read through my Bible and and we've heard the term a sweet smelling Savor to the Lord and the incense coming up from the altar of the Lord and I always thought boy it's it's probably like frankincense and myrr and some sort of Flowery smell or something like that because that's what what I would think but this smell smell of the burnt offering was burning flesh it was burning different types of fat from the animals and it would come up before the Lord and it pleased God to smell this burning fat in this burning flesh coming up before him now as I was studying on this this this week I thought why did that please him and I'm thinking my carnal mind a a dead animal being cooked I mean obviously it pleases me especially if Stephanie's depending on what she's cooking but not that doesn't make sense to me but God is looking down and this smell is coming up before him and it's a smell of an atonement it's a smell that something had died for the sins of his beloved children a wonderful smell and there they are and they're burning this flesh they're burning this fat and it's coming up and God is appreciating this and loving this because it means the atonement for his children that's why it's such a wonderful SW that's like it's a sweet smelling savor it pleased God because he knew that smell that flesh that death is an atonement for my children and then as we move along in the in the Book of Leviticus we we get to um chapters 8-10 and we see that that the as Moses is laying out all of these ordinances from God and all of these sacrifices so so the man would come and he put his hand on this this animal that animal would be killed and certain parts of its body would be would be cooked and and certain parts would be taken outside the camp and burned and then we have these men called the priests that are doing this holy work and these priests should be more holy than the congregation because of the importance of their job and they should never take advantage of the people and you'll you'll see what happens here shortly but everything they should live a holy life but what so amazing is that they even have to make sacrifices for themselves because they're all Sinners even these holy priests that live these what we would think would be perfect lives even they have sinned and they must make these sacrifices so let's read so you get kind of a feeling of how Leviticus is written let's read chapter 8 and this is Moses ordaining the first first ministers the first priests Moses or um Leviticus chap 8 verse one and the Lord spake unto Moses saying take Aaron now do we know now it's really important that the the these priests they they come from a certain line remember we have 12 tribes and they uh they come from the tribe of Levi all right so so if you're going to be a priest you have to come from the tribe of Levi and the Lord spake unto Moses saying and Moses was from the tribe of Levi and his brother Aaron obviously also was take Aaron and his sons with him and the garments and the anointing oil and a bulock for the sin offering and two Rams and a basket of unleavened bread and gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the Tabernacle of the congre ation and Moses did as the Lord commanded him and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation and Moses said unto the congregation this is the thing which the Lord commanded to be done and Moses brought Aaron and his sons and washed them with water and he put upon him the coat and gted him with the girdle and clothed him with the robe and put the ephod upon him and he girded him with the Curious girdle of the ephod and bound it unto him therewith so he's putting on this whole uniform and he put the breastplate upon him also he put in the breastplate the urum and the thumm now we see this this urum and Thum so what this is is this is a breastplate that Aaron has and on that breast plate are lined up 12 Stones and those 12 Stones represent and they're even labeled for the 12 tribes of Israel now we know from brother brandom that that uraman thumin played a very important role later on that was how many times how leaders would make the right decision is they would bring a decision before this breastplate and if it flashed then the answer was yes and if it stayed quiet then the answer was no so right here is a very very important important scripture and he put the miter upon his head and also the miter even upon his his Forefront did he put the golden plate the holy crown as the Lord commanded Moses and Moses took the anointing oil and Anointed The Tabernacle and all that was therein and Sanctified them and he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times and the and Anointed The Altar and all his vessels both the Laver and his foot to sanctify them and he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head and anointed him to sanctify him and Moses brought Aaron's sons and put coats upon them and girded them with girdles and put bonnets upon them as the Lord commanded Moses and he brought the bulock for the sin offering and and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bulock for the sin offering and he slew it and Moses took the blood and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger and purified The Altar and poured the blood at the bottom of the Altar and Sanctified it to make reconciliation upon it notice that again what I said these priests they also had to be purified and he took all the fat that was upon the inwards and the call above the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and Moses burnt it upon the altar but the bulock and his hide his flesh and his dung he burnt with fire without the camp outside the camp as the Lord commanded Moses and he brought the RAM for the burnt offering and Aaron and his sons laid their heads upon the RAM and he killed it and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about and he cut the ram into pieces and Moses burnt the head and the pieces and the fat and he washed the inwards and the and the legs in water and Moses burnt the whole Ram upon the altar it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet Savor and an offering made by fire unto the Lord as the Lord commanded Moses and he brought the other Ram a ram of Consecration and Aaron and his sons laid their hand their hands on the head of the ram and he slew it and Moses took of the blood of it and put it on the tip of Aaron's right ear and upon the thumb of his right hand and upon the great toe of his right foot and he brought Aaron's sons and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear and upon the thumbs of their right hands and upon the great toes of their Right feet and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about and this is how the book of Exodus is written I mean The Book of Leviticus is written Blood on the ear it's all symbolic Blood on the ear may he hear the word of God Blood on the thumb may he do the will of God and blood on the toe may he walk in the ways of God everything in this book is symbolic and as you're reading it just stop for a minute and say Lord what do you mean by that because it's it's beyond me and there's an answer so the priests were holy the way that God's plan is but we need someone to stand for us and that's what the priests were there for they were to stand for the people but this is before Christ look at how beautiful this is all of this work that these priests had to go through yet they still this is the most beautiful thing yet they still needed a sacrifice for their own sins it shows that it's symbolic of something later to come 1500 Years Later by the way the dates that I'm getting if you have a scoffield Bible you probably already know this but if you have a scoffield Bible there's the these inner parts of it up here at the top of the center piece are the dates that this happened so if you have a scoffield Bible those are the dates that um I believe that uh scoffield took from a man publication from a man named Usher to uh to get those those dates but 1500 years after this happened a man named Jesus Christ comes now there was always a mediator between God and Men it was these it was these priests and they would do the sacrifices and they were the ones that would go in to this to this Tabernacle and offer this for the people and in fact one time a year this priest would go in behind in the back room to the holy of holies and then God's presence would come down and he would represent the people one man a year in millions of Jews but then we have the Apostle Paul come by 15600 years later and he says this for there is one God and one mediator between God and man not all of these different Levites but one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus all of this is symbolic of this man that was to come the whole Old Testament is laying a foundation for Jesus Christ that's how important he is and that's something friends that we lose if this book two-thirds of it in the Old Testament is written to lay a foundation for Jesus Christ how important is he I loved what brother Lyall did in his last one he was typing Exodus to to the Lord Jesus and everything is about him and if we're teaching about something else we're teaching about something that's not as important as Christ so the stakes were high for these priests they had to live a life that was above reproach and remember just there's there is just the blood of animals making this atonement not the blood of a sinless man called Jesus Christ that would one day do that so in Leviticus 9 when they make when these priests would come in and they would make these sacrifices you go through the Book of Leviticus and it lines out almost every step in what they're supposed to do so these priests would go in there and they'd follow exactly what Moses had told them and they would make the sacrifices now watch what happens when it when when they do it right Leviticus 9 chap uh verse 23 it says this and Moses and Aaron verse 23 Moses and Aaron went into the Tabernacle of the congregation and came out and blessed the people and the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people and there came God was pleased with their worship and there came fire out from before the Lord and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat which when the people saw they shouted and fell on their faces I have that highlighted here they were around the Tabernacle and they were shouting before the glory because of the glory of the Lord now let me see this Tucson Tabernacle it's okay if you shout every once in a while it's okay if you say Amen every once in a while we're a bit of a quiet group group but I want to tell you the original Tabernacle what we are named after they shouted and they praised and here it is right here I can prove it in the scriptures so Leviticus the next chapter chapter 10 God is still dealing with the priests and it we have to as a minister now we know that the blood of Jesus Christ is there and we make mistakes and I make mistakes and I claim that blood for me but remember that this office in opening this book it should be done with fear always always with respect and preparing and and working on a sermon and praying because if I am wrong or if any Minister that stands in this Pulpit or any other Pulpit is wrong we also have a example way back in the Book of Leviticus 3500 years ago from this point that shows what happens when a minister doesn't take his office seriously Leviticus chapter 10 verse one and naab and Abu the sons of Aaron took either of them his sensor and put fire therein and put incense thereon and offered Strange Fire before the Lord which he commanded them not now we don't know what this Strange Fire is I've have studied and tried to figure out what this is it could have been that that they had these sens and and however they did it they could have even just lit it wrong everything was lined out on how to do they could have used the wrong type of vessel they could have done something wrong they did something wrong but the point is they didn't have the respect that they should have they maybe let this become common to them right and that's what happened right here and there went fire out from the Lord and devoured them and they died before the Lord they disrespected God's word the ministers did and then Moses these are his these are Aaron's two two boys his two sons then Moses said unto Aaron this is that the Lord spake saying I will be Sanctified in them that come nigh unto me these ministers are the ones that are supposed to be coming into my holy Tabernacle and they came here and they disrespected it they took it for granted they didn't take it seriously I will be Sanctified in them that come nigh to me and before all the people I will will be glorified and Aaron held his peace it was a LAX attitude from these ministers they did not respect the sacrifices of the Lord now chapters 11- 15 are about the ritual Purity required of all the Israelites and then chapters 18 through 20 are about moral Purity now Purity and impurity because God is Holy then the people as I said the people need to be holy and when they enter into his Holiness and there are words that are said that may seem kind of strange there's clean and there's unclean now it's it's now that word clean and unclean doesn't mean sin it doesn't mean that um that you uh that you have sinned so you're unclean what it is is you could come in contact with certain bodily fluids skin diseases you could touch like mold or fungus or or you could be you could touch a dead body anything that was Associated it seems that was associated with death if you touch that you become unclean or impure and then there is a purification process that you could get back but but this this wasn't necessarily sin it wasn't sinful there was a purification process as I said and then the person could come back what was sinful was to disrespect God's rules what these two sons of Aaron did and then another form of impurity was eating certain types of animals and some of these animals they're a bit odd God's holiness was reflected in in every part of everyone's lives from the their diet to the way that they wash their hands all the way till they to they came to the priest and then the priest offered the sacrifices I was in I was in Israel a few years ago and uh we had this really hardcore Jewish guide and we uh we went around and we came to the place where is celebrated as the place that that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and we were there and then we had all these Americans that were in the bus and then some some people from other a couple people from other countries and there were all of these if you looked out there there were all these catfish swimming around in the Jordan River big ones they they were going around I was thinking man I wish I had my fishing pole you know I'd sneak right Upstream a little bit and I was watching these catfish so then the tour guide he remember he's Jewish he tells all of these all of of these people he's talking loud like I am and he's he's giving the tour and he says oh he says a catfish is a filthy animal he says he says they go in the mud and they eat bad things and he says oh if if just people if anybody would eat a catfish it would make them sick and and there just there's just no way that they should they should eat these disgusting animals it makes a disgusting person that would do that so one of the Americans says goes up to him and I I see him he whispers he said hey um Americans they eat catfish and I was like listen and he goes oh so then he goes back and he says oh but but I'm sure it's okay to eat it you know you know they're they're they're God's creation they're animals and and then he starts making excuses to why what he said was wasn't wasn't right it wasn't as hardcore as it was I thought I thought that was kind of funny but that's how he thought of of this type of food that was laid out in this This Book of Leviticus that you don't eat so you take that Through the Ages and sometimes it is a protection if you look in 14th century Europe the plague was just destroying Europe and the Jews which there are many of them for the most part they escaped the in ction of the plague and it was because of their hygiene because of their diet because of the way that they ate they escaped much of these dreaded diseases just because they followed This Book of Leviticus then Leviticus chapter 16 and 17 talks about the day of of atonement now to me when I was reading this as I said I was so excited when when I read this book and it's a day it's really the Highlight to me of the book it's not necessarily a day of Celebration it's really a day of repentance mourning for all the sacrifices done for the people during the year when they would sin the sins of every person there there's no way that they could be covered for the everyone going and offering the the sins and sacrifices let me stop there for a moment when these sacrifices were brought to the priests to be offered they were whether it be a lamb or a goat or a or a bull it was the very best that they could get this was the prized bull or the most beautiful lamb that that they could find it was important that these these Jews had the best sacrifice that could be made because it it was for their atonement for their sins and as you see the Bible go along you see the people start to stray from that and you get to the last of the Old Testament This Book of Malachi and it had just gone South now they were taking just the the ones with broken legs the one that couldn't they couldn't sell they were taking the very worst of the sacrifices and offering that up because it didn't take anything out of their pocket they still did their sacrifices but it wasn't sincere but we see here in Leviticus we see it is the very best that they could that they could bring before the priest and friends that is what has happened to this world look at as I was preaching this morning do we offer God our very best when we pray is it at the time that my mind is most clear is it or is it just oh yeah I forgot to pray I gotta I got to spend a couple minutes in prayer before I go to bed I'm tired anyways do we offer God our very very best with our tithes with our offerings with with our prayers with our devotions with our families everything is it God first or is it the typical world of today where I'll give God a little bit what whatever I can spare and I'm not talking about money I'm talking about your time I'm talking about your feelings I'm talking about your prayers am I giving God my very best my time they did here in This Book of Leviticus so this day of atonement it was a time as I said when that the atoned it atoned for all the sins that weren't yet covered one of the sacrifices for this day of atonement they take two goats one goat is killed on behalf of the nation and it's killed receiving the punishment for the nation so the nation should not die of those unatoned for sins and the second and this is what blessed me so much this was my highlight of reading this book the second is what's called a scapegoat you ever hear that that term the priests they kill the first goat and then the priest lays his his hands both hands this time on the head of this goat and he lays symbolically he lays the sins of the Nation on this goat and then he turns it Loose Into the Wilderness and they watch this goat travel away knowing that the sins of the whole country are on that animal and they wanted to get as far away as it can be because it's carrying their sins farther and farther away and as they see the goat getting smaller and smaller and they're taking note he's gone this way he's gone that way he's going farther and they're Joy just gets greater and greater as that goat would go far until he's finally gone our sins completely taken away and when I read that I remember a few years ago I break broke down crying thinking that Jesus Christ is the one that took my sins he represented that scapegoat he stood for me he took my sins and he took them far away so far away that they're completely gone out of the remembrance of even God what a wonderful wonderful thing this scapegoat and what it represents taking our sins and walking through the Wilderness till it's completely gone this happened every year this day of atonement and friends the as we as we get to the close of this the purpose of this law that we see in Leviticus was not to show how approachable God is it was to show how unapproachable he was back then it was to show how careful you had to be look at those two priests they offered Strange Fire we don't even know what it was but they just they just took it a little bit common and God struck him dead right there you couldn't just go to God only that priest could go for you and the priest had to go under the sacrifice even of a clean animal and let me stop right here that's why Roman Catholicism is wrong the very tenants of the Catholic church that a priest can answer for the sins of the people that is passed it didn't work that was a period of time that was to stay the wrath of God now we have Jesus Christ it can't be a priest that answers for your your sins it can't be a pastor that answers for your sins it certainly can't be Mary that is a mediator between you and God only one man the man Christ Jesus in this whole Book of Leviticus shows that these priests are an example of Christ but they were an impure example Christ didn't need to do a we didn't have to have a sacrifice for Jesus Christ he was perfect in every way lived a perfect life in every way you heard that Jesus is the high priest that's what it's talking about right here in the Book of Leviticus chapters 18- 27 are about fellowship with God through sanctification through living a clean life and it it you see the way that the Jews have become and all of their little rituals and everything that that they do it comes from this book Book of Leviticus and and how that they live their life and to make themselves pure but they don't have Christ it didn't work with the priests it was something to stay as I said to stay the wrath of God yet they're trying there's for 2,000 years they've been trying to stay with it we should be thankful every day that we have that atonement called Jesus Christ that This Book of Leviticus is alive in a man a man that rose from the dead and it's true every word in this book is is true and it's beautiful and it's represented the reason it's so beautiful the reason it's so great is because it became flesh and dwelt among us and gave his life and then rose from the dead one little nugget that's easy to overlook can we go back to Genesis I mean sorry Leviticus 1 verse one I really like this and the Lord called unto Moses and spake unto him out of the Tabernacle of the congregation what does that mean English Standard Version says this the Lord called to Moses and spoke to him from the tent of the meeting from the Tabernacle so we see Moses out here and we see God here and God is speaking to Moses from the house of the Lord now let's go to the next book Numbers chapter 1 verse one now watch what the book this is just me but the Book of Leviticus did something this law that God gave to Moses to be implemented did something look at this and the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness in the Tabernacle of the congregation so before Moses was outside now This Book of Leviticus now Moses gets to get in go inside and the Lord's speaking to him right there we can uh we can close if the musicians are ready um the New Testament quotes The Book of Leviticus more than 100 times and this is the book that I just wanted to get through because I didn't understand it more than a hundred times what other book does the New Testament quote that many times the book of Hebrews is one that highlights over and over the sacrifice ices and types in The Book of Leviticus beautiful tremendous tremendous book so we have here we have this Book of Leviticus it told them how to do everything it told them all the rules and the regulations and how to come into the presence of God remember said God's like the sun you don't you couldn't get too close to him or you die if you get too far away from him you get cold you get worldly and you die out there so you want to just be in his presence all the time and the Book of Leviticus shows that and it gives ways to do that now I want to give an example to lay a foundation for Wednesday so we have the 10 commandments remember from the book of Exodus and then the Book of Leviticus adds to those honor the Sabbath day and keep it holy so we see in the next book this guy's out and it's the Sabbath day Saturday back then that has to be kept holy and he's out and he needs to uh maybe warm his house or cook some food and he goes out in his yard and he picks up a couple sticks takes him brings him back to his house some of the other people in the congregation the other Hebrews they looked they were studying today's a Sabbath you're not supposed to do that huh so they go back they're like like man Aaron just not Aaron that would mess up everything Joe Aaron was the priest Jo Joseph here he goes Joseph went and he was picking up sticks on the Sabbath so they go and they take they take this information to Moses and to Aaron they're like hey um we don't know but but it says this the law says this Joe Miller was up picking up sticks Moses what do we [Music] do you're going to find out when brother Lyall preaches it's really an amazing end that you stand back and you say whoa this a big deal let's all stand there [Music] I claim the blood Jesus shed on [Music] calary those preious blood stains were made there just for [Music] me for for all my sin my sickness and my pain when I need healing oh I claim those precious blood stains I claim the blood Jesus shed on calary those preious blood stain were made there just for me for all my sins my sickness and my pain when I need healing oh I claim those blood stains it's a fitting fitting song for This Book of Leviticus it was all about the blood it was all about the sacrifice and these people were sincere and they gave their very best they tried to do it the best that they could and honoring what the prophet Moses brought from God concerning how to come into the presence of God for communion with god brother Ron if you'd come and close how important it is brothers and sisters it's even more today there is Grace today we don't die like Aaron's sons did but we've come into an attitude today where we don't respect this book we don't give the prophets the respect that we should give them the ministry doesn't give the word the respect that it should I want to make sure that if you get anything out of the Book of Leviticus this book is about our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and it's wonderful I encourage you you to listen to it brother [Music] [Music] Ron let us bow our heads and pray Lord Jesus we're we're grateful once again oh God that we've had a faithful minister to remind us of your word and what it means oh God forgive us Lord where we have not given our best amen yes but we're grateful for that blood amen oh my none of us oh God could make it but you are faithful Lord Jesus to your word and you were faithful to those oh God in those those times where they they they offered the the symbolic sacrifice of you oh Lord and oh God a prophet told us that when you were resurrected that all those Saints by faith had offered these animal sacrifices that it was brought to re it became real oh what a day Oh my he said that paradise was emptied out and those saints were resurrected because they they believed unto a promise amen oh God and we are living after the promise Lord Jesus let us be just as sincere as those early Saints and those children of Israel yes Lord we had a prophet that preached a sermon called respects and I'm I'm constantly reminded of that as I'm asked to come up here and pray Lord that I check my life I put my sins under your blood I take this very seriously amen amen and I hope oh God that you would put a a new and re renewed respect for your word and your presence and your love in our hearts that we would take this home and we would Ponder these things that's been said to us and look forward Lord to the next time that a faithful Minister would come that we would come with the right attitude Lord we thank you for this we thank you for this this place we thank you for the minister we thank you for all that put forth the effort we thank you for Lord for those that that have had a a

out to God his master a sinless man that had never done anything wrong let me tell you something Jesus Christ knew this Book of Leviticus he himself quoted it and he knew oh by the grace of God he knew he was that sacrificial lamb oh Hallelujah he knew he was that scapegoat he knew he was the one that that was written about he knew that he was going to be the one to deliver all of mankind he knew it that night brother Ron he knew it and when he was in that garden and he was praying he knew it and he said Lord suffering Lord let this cup pass from me but but thank God he said that thy will be done not my will and his will was done and he died for me brother and he died for you thank God what he is what a merciful god what a man that man Christ Jesus we read about him in the book the scapegoat and and the and the Bullock offering and and the lamb and and the sheep and and the and all of the offerings there was even an offer offering in there that they took the first fruits of the Harvest whether it be a lump of figs or whether it be wheat or whatever it was and the priest took it and he waved it in front of the people and he said look this is what is going to come these are the first fruits Harvest is almost here and Jesus Christ was that way W sheath Jesus came and God waved him in front of the people and he did Miracles he preached the gospel and he was waved in front of the people and then at the day of Pentecost the Harvest became ripe and the people did the same thing how beautiful how wonderful is our Lord and we are becoming ripe the bride of Christ Christ God
