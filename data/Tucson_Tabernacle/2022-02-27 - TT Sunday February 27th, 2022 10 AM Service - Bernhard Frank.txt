let us lift up holy hands magnify his name and worship let us lift up holy hands magnify his name and word [Music] for he alone is worthy amen in all the good things we have received from one another the blessings the encouragement the strength but to god is all the glory amen we have a prayer request from our brother tim cruz asking prayer for his mom sister tony she's not been feeling well for a few days now so we'll remember that in prayer also yesterday late afternoon we had the memorial service for our brother charlie zotero and the family just to keep them in prayer it's the events and all the the time together there's encouragement but then the quiet times and the alone times come so remembering them all hearing the boys talk about their dad or their older brother and the encouragement that brother charlie was to the whole family will be missed but jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you i'll be with you always so keep them in prayer also and if you have a need and you say lord sometimes you can't put it in words but he knows if he'll stand here with us and believe that all things are possible we you get to read testimonies and hear testimonies and and to see the miracle working god do something and then other times it maybe seemed like lord where were you in this somebody's life they lost their life they were but that's still a miracle because from the changing of this life to that life is still a miracle and which reminds me and then sister angela boyd the youngest of the brother dave and the green family she passed away on wednesday i believe it was we noticed but if you saw her today you would envy her to be where she is but you have that hope but remember them also the green family the yarbro family all of them that are involved with this but great is our our goddess lord we we don't talk to you or or have our conversation with you as if we were just talking to a inanimate object something that could not respond gods of silver gods of gold made of man's hands stone because we can make anything an object of worship but you're a living god a personal god took on flesh you you were born in a body of flesh so you could walk on this earth and be touched by the feeling of our infirmities the hurts and the sickness and the pain all the discomforts the discouragements the questions anything lord that we we would feel as humans you understood it lord therefore when we ask and we say lord i'm hurting i'm in pain i'm troubled you can come lord and be our help in this day lord so every heart every hand every request lord we ask that you administer in in a way that each one would recognize that you're mindful of them personally or today for your honor for your glory and for your praise in jesus christ's name amen if you'll be seated for a moment there we have with us this morning young couple who just got married this past saturday back in florida [Music] roger and ashley rodriguez from florida god bless you good to have you with us he's originally from venezuela the family's from venezuela so he was telling me some of the names some of the names we knew of course with brother galdon i've probably been the most prominent name and took him over to meet my dad and my dad has been down there and has met some of the folks that he was [Music] glad that you would come by our way man god bless you and then on the other side today actually is my mom and dad's 67th anniversary [Applause] i missed it by a couple of weeks last time but it was that anniversary was we had been here 46 years in tucson so i just but i'm grateful for that so i'd like to just read you something here brother jordan i gave him the quote with all that's happening today the threat of an atomic war the our brothers and sisters in europe and that part under that fear of being invaded by a a superpower but there's a superpower that has control out of all over all of that and he says do not fear i'm in charge of this so brother jordan if we read that there there will come a time people when we're not gathering here for in vain we're only waiting for that time it is very very late but jesus is still very very near and his glory it's wonderful his name shall be called the councillor that city can you see it there is where the bride and the groom will settle and never again too now if you think it's wonderful when we drive hundreds of miles to sit here and feed on his word which this is only a shadow what will it be when we live in that city with him when i live next next door neighbor to you and when we eat of those trees and we will walk in those streets when we walk up those streets of gold to the fountain drink from the fountain walk into the paradises of god with angels hovering the earth singing the anthems oh what a day that will be it's worth it all the road seems rugged sometimes it gets hard but oh it'll be so little when i see him so little what will the bad times and the things that they said what will that be when i see him in that beautiful beautiful city of god and sometimes your your vision gets locked into what's happening today but help us to look that just around the corner over the next hill we'll be home so when i read that i said i have just have to share that today to remind you that god is still in control he never has not been in control even if you might question and we have lord how could the holocaust be something you would allow and brother branham actually call it the tender hand of jehovah i think most of us would think the time that daddy or mom pulled our ears and gave us a spanking that his hands weren't very tender but their intention was to get you to grow up to to to mature as a christian or as a human being that was their desire and maybe as humans we didn't do it right but he's perfect in how he treats us what he does for us what he allows us to go through and that's why we love him today so and and i've always said god knows everything whoever stands behind the pulpit to minister god saw that day that's that's what he said the sheep are mine i will feed them i will take care of them so as we stand and make our brother bernard frank welcome but even more so trust that the lord is here that he'll minister words that we that would encourage our hearts maybe would come down and say you need some work on this part you need some adjustment here but i appreciate this about you too because that's how it works you you talk to your children you say you're good at this but we can work some on this it's it's a growing you know we look back now as adults when we say that was dad and mom doing their best to help me along you know wanting us to succeed wanting us to be good children wanting us to be good citizens well we represent a com a country whose builder and maker is god we want to be uh worthy citizens of that kingdom today so let the lord speak amazing grace how sweet this sounds [Music] how sweet the sound all that [Music] like me i once was lost i was blind but now i see the fourth verse when we've been there ten thousand bright shining as the sun we know this day to sing god's praise and when we first begun praise god praise god praise god praise god [Music] praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise praise god amen you may have your seats i like to greet each and every one in the precious name of our lord and savior jesus christ this morning and of course happy to be back in tucson and yeah it seems like i'm coming here more often than i used to but we always go there where we have precious friends and i wished i had the time to visit all my friends around this earth that i've known over the years but i'm sure the lord will come before that now we know we live in difficult times as a brother just mentioned and but i think that we as children of god know that we have nothing to worry and nothing to fear and we had the two years of the pandemic or pandemic or whatever people want to call it and i realized that the disease has taken the lives of some of our good friends some of them went prematurely some of them went at old age but in general the lord has been good to us and we know one thing that the day that we were born in this world and the hour and the place was not determined by us but it was determined by almighty god and if he choose the day the place the hour the parents you were born he knows exactly what is the moment the minute the place and how you're going to leave this world and that's why i'm so glad to know that our life is in his hands and whatever way he wants us to go that's the way we'll go and when and the whole thing with the virus came up yes there's a lot of people that were a little bit scared even among christians but the lord gave me the scripture which said you've not been given a spirit of fear but a power and a love and of a sound mind and and that's one thing that we're very thankful for that the lord has given us a sound mind and that we know that there's nothing to fear in this world and the things which are going on bro bran many times said watch russia watch russia he made the church repeat it you know and we know they're the king of the north and they have to play their part but i can assure you one thing everything goes according to plan and and that's just so maybe side road before forget to speaking but i've been reading one more time on the on the fourth seal where it said that one force of the earth lost their lives because of famine awards end of death or disease in another translation and you know every understanding that we have is just we never know in full we just look look partially into things but if i understand correctly we still are living under that fourth seal today because brother mahm said that those four seals cover the seven church ages we're still under that eagle anointing but it's also the time that the bible says one force of the earth will be taken away and when we see that has not fulfilled yet so we don't know what's coming before the rapture but there might be still many many scary things to this world happen but we're safe in christ and that's the main thing so we have nothing to worry this morning and from that point it's very sad for the people and it's a very shame when people lose their lives but remember there was a few plagues that also fell in goshen but then there came a time that god said to moses from now on the plague is only going to fall where the egyptians are but those that live in goshen they'll be safe so that's where we live this morning once again happy to be here and it's always a privilege thank brother aaron for giving me the privilege and this this afternoon i want to talk about this or speak about the subject learn of me and to talk about the meekness and the humbleness of a christian which whenever we come in difficult situations we should just keep that attitude and no matter what it is no matter what goes on in the church no matter what goes on in the people if we can just keep the right attitude things will turn out right so this morning if we could stand and i would want to read from exodus 25 and i just want to read one word exodus 25 verse 40. exodus 25 verse 40 and look that thou make them after their pattern which will show thee in the mount let us pray heavenly father lord jesus we realize that we are in your divine presence this morning lord lord the last thing that i would want to do is to present my own thoughts lord god our lord we know that you're the one that moves our thoughts lord god that you're the one that moves our lips it speaks through us lord and it speaks to us and i would ask you this morning that you would be a help or god for the people that are sitting here as brother aaron said and this is the way that i see it there your sheep you are the shepherd the great shepherd lord would you feed your sheep this morning and give them the right things lord god and that you would receive all the glory in jesus name we pray amen you may be seated well brother roger he once gave me a very nice license plate it says if anything if everything fails go back to the instructions and it shows the bible and that's one thing that we know that we have a sure guideline for the things that we need to do and for the things that we face and that god he said there to moses he said you just make everything after the pattern that's been shown to you and and that's the same with our lives whatever we do if we just keep to the pattern that was shown to us in the word of god then everything will be okay and but as soon as we start to deviate from the pattern we come into problems and i myself i have a thing when i get in a situation where all of a sudden i realize i'm stuck i i say just a moment the only way that i can get out of this stuck places i have to find out what does the word of god say about my situation now and that's the way out because the reason we get stuck is because we don't follow the pattern that we just somehow somewhat gotten off a track and that to me has been a very important lesson now the god that we serve he's an unchanging god his principles don't change things that he once did he always does him again and that is why we can see that he is that all-knowing god because he never has to change his plan and there are so many examples in the bible where we can see that and we i just consider when god made this earth in the beginning he said that he separated the waters which were below the firmament from the waters that were above the firmament and he called the firmament heaven right now i believe the bible the way it's written and when the bible says that there was waters above heaven visible heaven and waters below i just believe that so i believe that this earth was covered by water rebelled for a certain time and the bible said it didn't rain at that time the earth was just watered by dewdrops but then there came a time when that water came down in the days of noah and we can see that the life of people on earth which had been hundreds of years before within three generations went down to 120 years now that's god's principle you know he put he put this earth into what do you call the box when a baby is born prematurely incubator he put the earth into an incubator he covered this with water around he had a higher temperature higher humidity he fast breathe it let it grow and then let the water come down come to normal condition well the same way he did with every one of us he put us in a covered spot gave us more temperature nourished us there brought us to a certain point of time then he brought us out in this life god never changes his principle of doing things that's one thing that's for sure because you don't have to he knows what he does the first time was good and it was right and when he do it again well it's got to be right again so he has a pattern and these patterns apply to our life but these patterns also apply to our church whatever we do we have a pattern now the church services that we have church is not organized by man church is organized by god he set it up a place of worship a place of prayer a place where the word is being brought forth to the people a place where sheep can be nourished he's the one that set all these things up and we also see that in the old testament god gave leaders to the church he gave him moses and i have to say that that was a good thing for the people they didn't have to take a vote god took a decision and he said it's going to be moses he's going to be your leader it was very simple well before moses passed away god had decided on the joshua so the people didn't have to take a vote or decision god had taken the decision for them but it not always worked that way they came to a time where they had judges and the bible says in judges 21 25 he said in those days there was no king in israel and every man did that which was right in his own eyes and we can see that if you have a time like israel had a time without a king or without a judge things for a time could still continue but not for a long time and you forgive me but i'm going to speak to your church this morning i want to speak to your situation i want to try to share some of my experiences and i come to realize i'm not the young boy anymore i used to be i'm past 60 i have seen a lot come and go and i'll be honest with you when i was 20 and my parents or 15 my parents tried to tell me about their experiences i said keep your experiences for yourself i'll make my own i know you know what i'm talking about but but today i really have come to value experiences things that we have seen and we know brother greene he passed away almost seven years ago and you know i've been close friends with brother greene and i'm not saying that to make myself somebody here but that's just a fact we've been close friends maybe about two years or three years two or two and a half years before brother green passed brother kelly hildebrand and myself we visited brother green and we said to brother greene brother green we realize that you will not be here forever and we at that time ask him we said brother greene would it not be a good idea that you would make up your mind who would be your successor in this church and would you not want to establish a man to be the pastor after you would you not want to take the remaining time of your life to turn the hearts of the church to this brother that you would want to be the pastor well it didn't go that way i wish it would have but you can see i was i was kind of involved i saw the situation and well laureen at that time said well i haven't made up my mind and and then we asked him and we said well you have how many options you have and he told us the brothers and the names and i'm not going to mention any names it's just that's just my personal knowledge but then after he got finished speaking and i said he said i said brother green you actually have not been telling us the truth because you made up your mind you're just not ready to say it because i heard exactly what you said and he said yeah he said that's right but he never did it so we're now at a point almost seven years later and this church has not decided yet on who should be the pastor now i want to come in with my personal experience i've been in the very same situation when we started our church 15 years ago we had no plan of having a church i wanted to have tape services and i wanted to attend the regular church that i went to well the brother that we were going to church with he was very unhappy he felt like we were having tape services saturday night that would no that would that would be just for my family but he was not happy so we started also having tape services and i never wanted to be a pastor and a lot of people say yeah you want it no that's not true i never wanted to be so i'll let certain other brothers in the church handle things i let them decide who will speak when and who will take care of of the of the song service and it went quite all right for three years and i faced a lot of criticism from other churches that said but bernard you're not a church because you don't have a pastor and i kind of like you know try to defend myself i said i don't want to be a pastor but then i realized that things in our church were starting to go in the wrong direction friction started problem started and then i asked myself i said lord what must i do what does the word say and then i realized that the word says every church needs to have a pastor you can't go for x amount of years without having a pastor in the church it will not go good because it's not according to god's pattern i hope you understand what i'm saying so then in my own case and i was i was on the platform i was trying to defend my position i said to the people i said look i never wanted to be a pastor but i at least consider myself as an elder well some people got up while i was speaking trying to tell me to walk off the platform and things like this so i kind of felt i was done and i said to the people that you were gathered together i said you know what i'm finished i go home for me this is over but when i drove home there's two thoughts that the lord put in my mind the first one is sheep that do not want a shepherd are no sheep and that is the truth if you are a sheep and we know there is a great shepherd you are his sheep but still god has put overseers in the church the office of the pastor is an office in the church that god has installed which we have to have as a pattern and so that was the first thought that come to me and the second thought was how can two walk together unless they agreed and so my case i went back before the people and i said now listen the word of god says that every church needs a pastor and we have all requisites of a church we hold services we baptize people we dedicate babies we hold foot washing and communion so we're a church and if we're a church we need a pastor and then i told the people that were there i said okay this is what i want to tell you you first have to now take a vote and i come to that voting thing because there's an interesting quote from brother branham brother brahms said we have to do it under the leading of the holy spirit and we believe that that is the majority of the people so there is a point where you the congregation come in you know we can't always blame the leaders we sometimes also have to blame the congregation because both have a responsibility you know was many times in the country they always blame the leader yes you blame the leader but what did you do you know and that's why a church you have to take a decision and i asked my church i said now here's what you need to do you first needed to have a vote whether you want a pastor or not and if your vote is no that's fine you can just go ahead as you're pleased but i will not be here to take any responsibility because i realize the word of god said you need to have one right and that's one thing i would like to tell you now looking around and sharing other experiences now that in the message we have a lot of elderly pastors but a lot of times you can never see a good transitioning happening sometimes the older pastor would come to the point that he actually can't serve the people no more he would place another man in the pulpit to take care of the church but he would hold on to the office of pastorship for whatever reason i think that's wrong i think that's wrong you should take if you can't do the job then there's nothing wrong in taking a retirement and for those that know the old testament the hebrew priest could retire at 50 right so there's nothing wrong for a pastor to retire the only problem is how to take care of his finances afterwards let me say that also i talk here to message people now i've seen that i just talked to a brother over 80 years old has given all his life to be an evangelist sent out from a certain church never paid in a pension plan well now he lives on welfare and i ask him i said brother the church that you've been with for all these years now that you can't go out you're all too old to go out to preach do they give you any financial support he says no and i look at that and i said there's something wrong here you know we have to take care of our pastors also and that's a big problem i just i just put laid that out before you know we don't know how long we stay here but that's just one of the things that makes transitions difficult then i seen other case where the brother got old and he couldn't hold the pastorship anymore and the younger brother took over he was early 40 but the church would never vote him in till they came to the point that he said brothers and sisters i'm going to leave well finally they voted him in but i always say look the people have to take a decision and and there is a responsibility that the church has you as a people because brother brahm clearly says the highest authority is a local church and the local church needs to vote and we're having another situation also in in our city where brother passed away but i think three or four years ago now well no new pastor there's a group of three brothers they run it as a democracy any decision in the church they you know they send emails to to decide now a church cannot be run by a board of three or four people no matter what their decision is that's the truth because but the church has to take a vote and this is what i'm encouraging you you have sufficient brothers here that serve on the word i don't know them all i know brother aaron i know brother johnson's sitting here i know brother daniel there so there's others but there must be someone among you who will be the pastor of this church and i encourage you to take the way that the word of god says have a vote and if you have a vote don't play politics that's the last thing you want to do in a church don't ever play politics i've seen enough votes canceled it don't only happen in the political field it happens in the church too you know there's a church and they should decide who should be the pastor and there's two brothers that were the candidates two brothers that served the church well all of a sudden one steps up and says the lord spoke to me this morning i should be the pastor you agree right well what should the other brothers say you hear what i'm saying you know what i'm talking about if a man comes and says the lord spoke to me i should be the pastor well you should just say you're going to be subject to a vote like everybody else don't play any politics the other thing is don't ever let anybody come from the outside and tell you who should be the pastor i've been years ago at a funeral of a brother that had a little group somewhere close to the french border and he passed away been a good servant of god then they had called one other brother to come to the funeral but then another great and honorable minister from paris came and he said just a moment the lord told me i should do the funeral and speak the word here everybody aside it's not to laugh brothers sad story so he did the funeral after her funeral he went to the home of this brother there was a widow there was a son-in-law there were the sons there were other brothers and he read the scripture my servant moses is dead we have to bring in the joshua and then he said okay is there anyone here that want to be the pastor and there was one man from the church son-in-law of the old pastor he said i feel that i would want to wish to be the pastor well there was a son of that that brother that passed away who had a church far away from that place maybe 300 400 kilometers he had his job he had his house he had the church and this man said no not you this is the one that god has selected well the brother took over the church his job failed lost his house lost his marriage wife in the world you know and i sat there i was too young but if i would see something like this today i would step in and say wait a minute you are from the outside you have nothing to do in this church to meddle in their affairs the church is sovereign you the people are sovereign you that come and worship and fellowship here in tucson tabernacle you are the ones to decide and there's nobody else from the outside to tell you who should and who should would that be right i think that is right and there's one thing i wanted to say more i actually want to comment you on having stayed together the way that you have i want to comment you that you stayed at this place and been faithful to this church that you've been all those years most of you you know yourself 40 50 years right anybody that's been here 50 years see anybody who's been more than 40 years yeah you stayed faithful to this place but in order to move on you have to take a decision and the decision will be of the church the decision is not a board and i could read that from the quotes where brother brahm said that the board does not take the decision the church takes a decision and who will be a candidate well let's take the bible it says in first time 3 1 this is a true saying if a man desired the office of the bishop he desires a good work is that scripture does it mean that a person can have the desire to be a bishop okay now the bishop has to have qualifications the bible tells us not given to wine no striker not greedy or filthy look but patient not a brawler not covetous one that rules well his own house having his children in subjection with all gravity and verse two the bishop must be blameless husband of one wife village and sober of good behavior given to hospitality app to teach so there is nothing wrong in desiring to be a pastor in the church if the ambition comes out of a godly heart if it comes by natural ambition then there's wrong you know and many times it's those that don't want to that they're the ones and i talked to a good friend in africa he said we had the church and there was a brother where where i thought that he should be the one to be the pastor but he said there was another brother who said the lord spoke to me and finally the church voted for this man but he said two years down the line it was all destroyed and so it's not by human ambition it's not by putting us force that we say the lord spoke and the lord this i'm always careful because i know that a prophet would hear god's voice and i know that other people have i haven't heard an oral voice the way that god speaks to me is that he puts a thought in my mind and that i then know i need to follow that or if i took a decision which i shouldn't have taken that i can't sleep at night i know if you know what i'm talking about you know you take a decision in life you want to do something and then you go to bed and you can't sleep you can't find rest and then you know it's god talking to you he don't want you to do that you need to step back he just want to protect you from things you know but the church has the authority and if a man is a pastor there has to be also what i call an assessment if the pastorship has been beneficial to the church or not and it's not popularity now the greatest compliment the person in my church can give me is when they say brother bernard we really have feel that we have been fed the word of god over the last two or three years we really feel that we've grown in faith in stature in the spirit and one thing is for sure brother brahm said if you have the vote and the majority decides who the pastor is and then the minority don't leave right that's what he said but still once you take the vote there will be people that leave and everybody has the right to but after that happened i believe that the lord will add new people and just remember the person that you vote as pastor will never be a perfect person the person that you vote as pastor will not stand here by his own abilities but you have to believe and i know it's a truth that whomever you select god will speak to him so that he can speak to you now saying that i don't say anybody could come and be a pastor no that's not true but we have to believe that the man that god's put up here that god will be able to speak to him and and direct his thoughts that he could be able to speak to the congregation now i know it's prime material this morning but sometimes we need dry material and i had happened to me many times you know i preached a sermon and i feel good i thought man that was a wonderful sermon i came home i asked my daughter said becky how do you like it ah she said dad you know you felt enthused but i didn't really get something but then there's other times where i walk away from the platform and i say to myself i've been the worst failure this morning that i ever been i should never get back there and then i leave the church and somebody comes shakes my hand and he says brother bernard i had a question on my heart and the lord just answered it this morning and i can tell you when we feel incapable then he can do something the moment that we feel capable he can't work through us the moment they think we know well we'll become useless but the moment we feel that we are nothing then we can be something and that's why we have to do everything after the pattern that god gave us i don't come here as anyone who want to take your decision i want this church to see that it prospers i want you i want to see this place be filled with the holy spirit i want to see this place that lord can come down and minister to all of you i want this place to grow in strength in the spirit of god in faith and in the moving of the lord and you know just be fed by the word and i know brother green had been a very had a very balanced way of preaching and i love that i tried to keep my balance in the scripture and i think there's also one thing that we have to learn being in this message that preaching is more than reading quotes preaching is being able to take the word of god read it then be inspired and relate it to the people so that they can understand what that word is all about and i have nothing against reading quotes but if preaching is just reading quotes and that is not preaching and we have a we have a couple that been in another church for many years and the good point was they had a 60 miles go that way and 60 miles to come to our church so that that didn't change much but they they came and they started going to different churches and then they came to me and they said brother bernard we decided we want to come to this church and i said well why is it they said where we've been we've been just been fed quotes it was one quote after the other but we felt we were not fed but we feel we've come to the place where we can hear the word of god brother brown preached from the bible that was his quote book you know he when in 65 he could have gone back to what he said in 55 and said okay got a quote from here he never did that but still i encouraged to hear the tapes or read the messages but preaching is taking the word of god under the inspiration of the holy spirit and handing it out to the people that's preaching preaching is not reading the whole text what's already been said and that's what a minister needs to do that's what the bible says he must be apt to teach he must know the word he must know what it says and a lot of times and i don't want to be critical but a lot of times i meet people they can tell you every quote but if you ask them for a scripture to back up the quote they're lost that's why we should good preacher should know his bible that's what we believe we fashion after the pattern and saying that about preaching about ministers there's one thing that i've always said a preacher has to respect the congregation and the congregation has to respect the preacher and i say it that way if the minister speaks an hour and the people fall asleep that's no respect but if he speaks two hours and the people fall asleep it's a preacher's fault it goes both ways you know brother bram said we should preach like 30 45 minutes and he said i speak longer because i have to bring these things on tape that is stored in food for you do you season but many times a lot of people they they want to take two hours or more and i'll be honest i've been always a critical person for anyone to speak more than an hour but sometimes i come home after sunday morning and they said dad it's been hour 15. and then i tell the people i said okay i'm going to let you out a little earlier next week but that's another thing church stand behind the man that you vote for pray for your pastor respect him and have a pull in your heart that whoever you vote for that god will speak to you because if you follow the right pattern then god can bless you i don't say he didn't bless you the time you had no pastor i'm not saying that i understand that there is a time where you have to see who is the one but i think the time has come for you to decide you can't go on like this for x number of years because that is not the way that god has said it i hope hope it was okay what i said but that's the word of god we just have to do it the right way you know and people there you know they sometimes leave my church they go to another church i have no problem with that i learned from brother green and he told me whenever a man says i want to start my own church he said i asked him you have a building can i help you you got some pews he said maybe you need some instruments can i help you there brother green said the last i said was you also got people that are going to go with you he said if don't i just say okay these i want to select myself the ones you know we got to keep the right attitude now god has all called us to walk the same way because there's just one way and that is that jesus said i'm the way the truth is alive in the door no man comes to the father except by me so there's just one way into heaven and that is by jesus christ so i believe that no matter which local church we're in we're all going the same way and we're all going to the same place but not in the same local church so we got to love every church that's around us so when the people leave and they have the courtesy to tell me beforehand well we pray for them as a church we bless them we pray that the lord would let them be a blessing whatever church they go to now but still i come to one one thing now in our city we have i think four message churches but i actually clearly say now ours is the best well very logic if i would not believe that our church would be the best message church in town i would be in one of the others right so that's what your position should be you should believe when you're here this is the best church in town it is that's what it is you know and then i say but i want to give you a reason the first we still keep the good old-fashioned music that we was played years ago we don't go down the line of modern so-called contemporary christian music which is just another word for trash if you excuse the expression but i can also tell you when i would go into another message church and i hear those hillsong songs i say wait a minute where are we what is the spirit that's being portrayed here and that's why i want to keep that good old music in the church the godly that saintly music that brings down the holy spirit and not a kind of fake worship i think somebody just said it to me he said they're worshiping the worship they're not worshipping god that's the first thing where i think a good church should have good songs to sing that bring down the presence of god and that are becoming because look at the people that make these hill songs and the modern music you see there the way that they dress the way that they behave and you know that they're anointed by wrong spirit and then you want to go there to get the music i think it's completely wrong and that's why i say we're the best church we sing the old songs and then we have a word-based teaching of the word of god we preach the word we don't preach fables we don't preach ideas about the message but by the grace of god we can take the word of god and say the word of god says it it does say it's the lord and we walk with that because i still believe that when the word says jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever so it's still a word-based preaching we don't preach about this or that but we preach christ and him crucified that's what paul said other people they can preach this or that but i preach christ and him crucified and that's the subject of the message is jesus christ so that is why we don't need anybody to bring big revelations or high revelations or understandings we need someone in the pulpit that can preach jesus christ and him alive today in our lives that is what we need that is what i call good preaching you go to other places and then they they will tell you of all the benefits and then they say but only through this message as if people never got saved before brother brown came and i said to brother aaron this morning and i said yesterday talking to wilson the glory is to god alone god does not share his glory with any man so we do not give brother branham the glory the glory we give to god but to brother branham we give our respect for the office that he had been carrying it's two completely different things we worship a living christ and we know that we had a prophet on our generation but the prophet pointed us to that christ so that's the second element of a good church and the third element is prayer if you preach a good sermon and you say a little prayer and you sing a few songs and you leave the building you're missing something you're missing something where is the place where the spirit of god can move among the congregation it's in the prayer time after the word has gone forth and that's where we need to take time and i know it's not very common in message churches they don't let the congregation pray but the way i was raised we always had the occasion that after the word went forth brothers and sisters in the congregation could pray aloud and of course we're instructed how prayer needs to be we're not there to tell a life story it's not that one person takes 15 minutes and all the attention while we say a short prayer to god we start to praise him we start to worship him one person start to pray here and the spirit of god fall there that person starts to worship and the spirit of god fall there that's what we need in the church and if we don't give room to prayer in the church we're missing something we're losing the benefits because there is a time that god wants to speak to your heart you've heard the word now he wants to make the word life in your life and that's why i always say i want the prayer time in the church that that we have time that we give opportunity i know when people come in they come to the service maybe they never been in the message they just come to church two or three times but in the prayer time they all of a sudden open their mouth and start to pray and you can realize they haven't been around us they're just there for two or three weeks but you can see that god's been speaking to their heart that's also a good reputation for a church and i've seen that in yeah in the past couple of months we have some friends we've known them for almost 20 years and the lady has helped us to do the translation of the supernatural book when we started we've always been friends with them but they never came to church with us and then all of a sudden he gets very sick and he got a skin cancer and they come and talk to us and they said we've pushed aside all of our worldly engagements we left the clubs in the societies that we've been in you want to come to church and he himself used to be in a baptist church as a young man and after the second or third service he just come and hugged me he said bernard i'm so glad i found the way back where i was and you know they just come for two or three services and you look at them and they feel like they're right at home and this is what a church has to be when people come in here they have to feel that lovely atmosphere they have to feel that we're right at home and god just gave us a pattern that we need to follow the love of god among us and just that we don't play church but that we are church we don't play it we are the church we are the ones that the holy spirit works through we're the ones that bring our light into the building we're the ones that should encourage one another we're not there to build clicks is that a word that you use clicks is that the same you know little groups of people it's always good when the church is not too large because then it's easier not to form groups but i can say that about the church that we have at home i'm just so glad that in our church there's no clicks there's not one group here one group there but everybody can be together and fellowship together and this what we need the unity and the spirit the unity in the doctrine the unity in the place that we're going to that we know that we are united in christ that we're going to a place and i hope you don't hold against what i said this morning but that's my recommendation please decide on who you want to be your pastor please have a vote maybe not tomorrow but one of these days and please let nobody decide a list of candidates for you see that's also one way where politics come in and everybody has their place in the church and the deacons have their place the elders have their place the archers have the place the pastor has their place but let me say like this a church which is run by deacons does never work and let me share that one last point i i know of someone you always wanted to be a pastor if you finally found a church to pastor but it's run by the deacons and the way that it works is that they say well you know you're retired you're getting the pension so we're not going to pay you as a church but you know you've been a good pastor we're going to raise your your the amount we give you for each sermon from 50 to 75 that's wrong that is completely wrong once you vote for a pastor the pastor will become the head of this church and yet what you have to understand that's what brother brahm says i can read you the quotes but you know them all i'm not saying things that are news to you right or what i'm saying is news that's the truth once you vote for the pastor the pastor will become the head of the church and he will be in charge that's what brother brahm said that's the way it's organized but that's the way it should be that's the way god made it and you pray for the man whomever you decide and the lord bless you let's pray heavenly father lord jesus we come to you this morning and we want to thank you lord for this opportunity to say the things that needed to be said lord god lord i want to ask you that you would put your wisdom on the people of this church lord god and you would give them the right inspiration and the right decision of heart lord jesus lord that people would not vote just by their intellectual thoughts but the people would get down on their knees and say lord who do you want to be the pastor of this church and then let god speak to their hearts and that they know to make the right decision brother ram said that the decision is the holy ghost and the majority we'll take that for the holy ghost but it takes prayer by every person lord will you just help them is my prayer lord jesus and lord you know i have a neutral position in this place lord god i do not favor anyone but i want to this man to be the pastor that you decide to be the pastor lord and then i ask you a blessing on this church this morning lord ask the blessings for the people that have stood faithful in his tabernacle lord some of them walked away but there's a group of people that stayed faithful to this place lord god would you just reward them for their standing lord would you pour their blessings upon them by your grace and we give you the honor and praise in jesus name amen god bless you and the service back brother aaron god bless you see you this afternoon god bless you [Applause] you should be happy or you're not the one that has to stand up here now but god has spoken he's never left us he never will leave us and it's and brother dan i always have a song and i was standing back there and i said i don't have a song but he said yes you do he says where he leads me i will follow [Music] where he leads me i will follow [Music] will follow where he needs me i will follow i'll go with him with [Music] let's go him to that verse again where he leads me i will follow you realize what you're saying you raise realize what you're committing to where he leads me not lord lead me where i want to go but lord i will follow where you will lead me that's our willing we have to say yes lord i surrender to that might be contrary to what i think it should be or how i feel about it but will say lord i will follow one more time where he leads he'll stand with me i will follow [Music] where he leads me i will follow where he leads me i will follow i'll go with him with him all the way there's a verse that says i'll go with him through no i believe there's another one through the judgment [Music] i'll go with him through the judgment i'll go with him through the judgment i'll go with him with you all the way [Music] and then when you follow him when you say yes lord whatever it is not my will but thy will be done and he says that's what i've been waiting for for you just to say then he was just then that verse with grace and glory [Music] he will give me grace and glory [Music] he will give me grace and glory he will give me grace and glory and go with me with me all right it's just [Music] lord it's been six and a half years now since you took brother perry home because it was that time [Music] maybe some of us would have wished that he could have become young and strong again and continue to lead the church on but you had a different way for us to go [Music] and brother bernard had mentioned to me what he had felt the lord gave him to speak this morning and it was nothing we had talked about previously or i encouraged him lord but you had saw this day and you would choose for him to come and speak to us lord because you're mindful of us and we are your sheep lord now help us as a congregation those that call this church home they attend here faithfully they pray with us they they desire lord for us to grow as a body as part of the flock of god lord lead us guide us and may we be willing to say lord i will follow i will go with you i will let you lead i will let you direct and the decision that is made lord being made through the holy spirit lord would be the best thing for this church here lord it's our desire lord i i would say it's my desire but it's all our desire to grow in the grace of god not necessarily in the amount of people to say we need this amount or that but people here filled with the holy ghost people loving the lord jesus and such a presence and an atmosphere in the light here that others would say let's go see what's happening there let it be lord jesus is our prayer in jesus christ's name amen amen you've prayed that you believed that now let's believe that together that's my desire here tell my wife could tell you how many times i sat there and said oh to see that whoever it would be that this church not because we want it filled to say we're the biggest church in town but filled with people that love the lord jesus and the lord jesus is here with us that's our desire brother bobby you would keep coming wouldn't you i'm always glad to see they come and they lend their support and they they pray for us god bless you today [Music] honestly god bless you today whatever he desires and and each one of us just say lord if it's not the way i see it but it's the way you see it help me to line up with it amen we'll give the glory to jesus [Music] we'll give the glory to jesus and tell of [Music] his his love will give a glory to jesus and tell of his wonderful love will give the glory [Music] is [Music] give the glory to jesus and tell of his wonders [Music] brother bernard will be speaking again this evening and lord has placed something on his heart and god feeds his sheep so come and be fed tonight as i pray and and one of the things that brother bernard talked about prayer prayer prayer is just not a bunch of words spoken you can read a prayer you can quote a prayer but prayer is your heart communicating to god and god speaking back to you if you could only get three words out and it got to god and he came back that'd be the best prayer you ever had you know that to be the truth that's the way when he responds back to your prayer and begins to minister to you so believe that as you go we'll give the glory to me and [Music] of his love will give a glory to jesus [Music] some glad [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] of this life have gone out [Music] like a bird from prison bars [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i'll never die hallelujah oh just a few more weary days and then to a land where joy shall never [Applause] [Music] i will fly away o glory i [Music] [Music] i'll purpose this in your heart till that all-fly-away day but until then i'll purpose my that with joy but until then [Music] we'll go [Music] until then with joy i'll carry on [Music] until the day my eyes behold that's it [Music] until the day god calls me the first verse [Music] is [Applause] [Music] that's winding always upwards [Music] but until then my heart will go [Music] until then with joy i'll carry on until the day my eyes behold [Music] now you sang that and it wasn't just a song it's a promise you made to god but until then my heart will go on sing with joy i'll carry on not a forced but yes the lord's been good to me as you go now until my heart will go [Music] until then with joy i'll carry on [Music] until the day my eyes behold that sitting until [Music] calls the next person the things [Music] oh that caused the heart to tremble remember there will only [Music] heart will go until then with joy i'll carry [Music] my eyes behold that city until god so [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] um [Music]
