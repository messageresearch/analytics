we close father this Torah we ask Lord that you be with us father bless all that are here in Jesus name amen before I have you seated let's let's read a a famous scripture in the book of Deuteronomy Deuteronomy chapter 6 we'll start with verse four reads like this here o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shalt talk of them when thou sest in thy house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou r up and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes and thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house and on their Gates amen may the Lord add the blessings to the reading of his word you may you may be seated I want to thank everyone as I as I sent out this morning for their testimonies and songs on Sunday it was really a blessing for me a charg my battery Sunday night I appreciate all that you all did um you know singing songs of praise it's been throughout this Bible it's always an encouragement and it encourages us and encourages me there was uh sister Priscilla fryo she uh got in touch with me just a little while ago and uh she said she met a brother at uh the QT is that right she was talking with him and and uh she invited him to church brother George if you'd stand up God bless he's a truck driver he's he's just just passing through thank you my brother he's just passing through and he got invited to church and he wanted he said he wanted to go to church so welcome welcome my brother and it's really an honor to meet you brother Eli and family God bless you welcome I um wanted to make a couple announcements first what we're going to do this weekend we're getting a shipment ready to go to Uganda want to have the young people out uh for now unless I change it we'll do 10 o'cl here at the church for the Youth to get together and go through some of these boxes and we're going to get a shipment to go overseas so that's I'm really looking forward to that we'll eventually probably bring them uh brother Caleb perz from Las crusis and his church they'll help us get the more over there to Uganda I'm looking forward to that and then afterwards the youth will have a um a volleyball event at uh at the um sister Connie and brother Kevin's house um so that and that'll be for the Youth we'll go 13 and up for that and they wish they could have everybody there but they can't they have so that's just for the Youth we um got to tell you as I've been studying this book of Deuteronomy over the past few days past week I got really sad and thinking how important that this book was and and when it was written and the the spirit that it was written in we have this man Moses who wrote These first five books of the Bible we call them the Torah he wrote Genesis and then Exodus is an account of Moses's birth and his life and then the Exodus coming out of Egypt tremendous story and and you know it beautiful little baby born and put into the Nile River then he's taken out he he raises up to where he was probably going to be the next Pharaoh he made a stand for his people then he ends up going into the Wilderness and Exile and the Lord brings him back he has the experience with the burning bush brings him back he through a mighty hand pulls all of these slaves out of Egypt and then we go to Leviticus and as I ministered on Leviticus Leviticus is it's a very special book in that God made a way for the people to live in his presence they were a sinful people as we all are and God had given them this thing we call the law and and the Bible calls it the law and allow them to get closer to God and to live in his presence and I use the analogy of the sun if you get too close to the Sun the power of the sun will burn you up but if you get too far away from the Sun you'll die you'll freeze to death so you want to live in the right presence of the son and that's what the Book of Leviticus did it made a way for the people to live close to God and to get the benefits of being around him and that's what this thing called the law is very very special ordinances that God set forth that the people would live and then we get to numbers numbers was when when we had Leviticus we have Exodus they come out at ends they're at Mount Si when Moses gets the Ten Commandments Leviticus that um Moses brings those Commandments tells them to the people they're still right there at Mount Si they've only been out of Egypt for less than 11 months less than a year and then the Book of Numbers is when they start upon their Journey brother Lyall brought that last week and and they had an amazing thing they had a pillar of fire in the daytime or in the night time and a pillar of cloud at night that would lead them out through the Wilderness and they had all kinds of of things happened when they were there they um the people immediately started complaining and it angered God In This Book of Numbers they they even came against Moses himself in this book and as they're traveling through this desert they come to this place called Kadesh Baria God had promised remember Abraham like 400 years earlier that he was going to give them a Promised Land Moses was this deliverer he goes out and he he brings them out and he says hey we're going to go to this promised land they get excited they go out God shows his shows himself on Mount Si they Moses brings down the law the people start moving they start complaining they start doing their thing and then they come to this place called Kadesh Baria and this is right where right across the river from the promised land they were right there so Moses takes 12 men Great Men sends them over this River to spy out this land they go out there and they witnessed that this land was everything that God said it was it was a land flowing with milk and honey it had grapes and had figs and it had all this this wonderful place that they would live their lives but they came back and 10 of the 12 Spies that went over they said we can't do it these are really big men over there they're Giants we can't we we can't there's no way that we could take the land and Joshua and and Caleb said no we can take it God's for us we're able it doesn't matter and they were afraid that 10 were afraid over here they had forgotten that Moses went to the Red Sea they came to this Red Sea and the this armies were following them and God parted the Red Sea on both sides if he can do that surely he can kill a giant and then after that the water comes back down and destroys Pharaoh's Army and then they get hungry and they start complaining of that God Reigns food in the form of Mana down from heaven and yet they complain expained and then they get thirsty Moses goes up to the Rock God tells him to Smite The Rock he smites the rock water comes out of the Rock and then they drink on and on God gives them Miracles and yet they complained and these men come over and then they come back from kades Baria they start saying that we can't do it Joshua and Caleb are saying we can and they get the people these 10 get the people all stirred up into a big problem and a big fight to the point where they were going to kill even Moses Moses goes before God and what did Moses do God killed them no Moses pleads for their for Mercy from God God says all right I won't kill him but they're not going to go into the promised land in fact every single one of them is going to die in this Wilderness except for those two ones that they believed in me and remember Moses he had smoked the rock the first time water came forth he comes out God tells him this time speak to the Rock they need water so speak to the Rock he goes out Moses glorified himself smacked The Rock God told him to speak to it he smacks it doesn't water doesn't come out he does it again water comes out God tells Moses now you are not going to go over because you disobeyed me so here we have all of these Israelites that were promised to go over and none of them except for two the two loyal men and Joshua and Caleb were going to be able to go over and God promised that so they wander in the wilderness for 40 years they were right there at Kadesh Baria but instead they go wandering around this Wilderness for 40 years and they start dying out all of these people millions of them have to die before this next Generation can come up so when we're understanding this book of Deuteronomy we have to have to understand the setting here and the setting is Moses is an old man he's one of the last ones left and he's giving his final statements to these Hebrews before he is going to die and then this next generation is going to go over the Jordan River so that's the setting in the book of Deuteronomy Deuteronomy is a Greek name which I don't really understand it's a Greek name for a Hebrew Book and it means the second law brother ROM called it two laws and it's a series of sermons by Moses and the Book of Deuteronomy really there's nothing new in the book we pretty much know all the stories and all the law that is mentioned in Deuteronomy but this is Moses right at the end and this is a Next Generation that's coming up they've been wandering in the wilderness 40 years with the promise that all of these people have to die before you can go over this Jordan so Moses is now knows that it's his time to go everyone else is gone so Moses is preaching a series of sermons and that's the book of Deuteronomy so we get to hear Moses preach tonight and these are his closing statements This is the End Moses is doing his best now to say Hey listen to what I've told you because this is this is it I'm about to leave now you people your parents are gone your grandparents are gone but you have to carry on with this word of God that I brought you the first 11 chapters of Deuteronomy Moses summarizes what has happened so far and calls on this generation to be more faithful than those before him then in chapters 12-6 it's a collection of laws in the center of the book and most of them are repeats from the previous books with uh one of them they're talking about the central Temple that there's one God and then chapters 16- 18 Outlaws the um outlines the character of leadership among the the priests the elders and the priests and they were all placed within the authority of the law and then he says this he he he puts all of these elders and Priests in order and then he says that I'm even going to send prophets now to make sure in the future to make sure everyone is living up to what Moses has said and he introduces these prophets that are to come to keep people straight morally and with with this the law then 19 through 26 there's more laws about marriage and family and widows and orphans and business and all kinds of everyday life and also more laws about worship and what these are is these laws laws are what separates Israel that sets Israel aside from the rest of the world I'll get into that here in a little bit and then in 27 through 34 Moses issues a challenge to Israel to listen and to love God and if you listen to him and you love him then things will go well but if you don't then there's going to be continued problems and sufferings and God is even going to kick you out of this land that you're about to go into so Moses knew and unfortunately Moses knew everyone that was there he knew their parents and he knew their grandparents and he knew that these people that were going over were probably going to go the same way as their parents had gone but he still Moses ends his sermons here with a blessing like all the prophets do and then Moses walks up to the mountain and he dies so let's start with Deuteronomy chapter 1 verse one these be The Words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness in the plain over against the Red Sea between perin and toppel and L and hezaro and diab there are 11 days journey from Hed by the way of Mount seir to Kadesh barnea and it came to pass in the 40th year in the 11th month on the first day of the month that Moses spake unto the children of Israel according to all the Lord had given him in commandment unto them now this is very interesting you look at verse two and it it it makes a statement that would be really easy to look over it says that this should have only taken 11 days from Horeb to Kadesh barnea Horeb is the mountain range that Mount Si is in and it should have only been 11 days journey to the promised land but then it says now you're in the 40th year of this journey so he lays it all out right there in these first couple verses he said it should have only taken you 11 days but you've been there 40 years and he and he goes on and he says when we arrived at kades Baria I sent 12 Spies over as I said now he's going to tell this story again I sent 12 Spies over and you spied out the land and it was a good land and you even brought back some of the fruit that was there but you said that they were too big for us to battle these men these Giants and then you complained and the Lord took you out of e the Lord took you out of Egypt to give you into the the hands of your enemy so you said these people said after all these Miracles they said that the Lord took us out of Egypt just to give us into the hands of our enemies look at the lack of faith that is in these people so Joshua and Caleb and Moses here says don't you know that God fights for you the Lord carried you through the Wilderness like like a father would carry a son it's not just you that has to go to these battles it's God that goes to these battles for you but you wouldn't trust him skip to verse 34 it says right here and the Lord Heard a Voice of your words and was wroth and swear saying surely there shall not be one of these men of this evil generation see that good land which I swear to give unto your fathers because of all the complaining because of the lack of confidence none of you are going to go over this Jordan and Moses right now don't forget is speaking to not all those that Sinn but he's speaking to their children and their grandchildren except for Caleb save Caleb the son of japun he shall see it and to him will I give the land that Heath trodden upon and to his children because he hath wholly followed the Lord also the Lord was angry with me for your sakes saying Thou shalt not go in tither so Moses is saying here that the Lord is punishing me too because of your unbelief and I can't go into the promised land but Joshua the son of none which standeth before thee he must have been as Moses is here preaching Joshua must been must have been standing right there with Moses but Joshua the son of none which standeth before thee he shall go inther encourage him for he shall cause Israel to inherit it now notice these two men Joshua and Caleb as I said before they are it they're the only ones that are going to go over now remember I said that when they went over they went over to to spy out the land and they said these men are too big we get a little uh example of how big these Giants were in chapter 3 and this is this is really neat in chapter 3: 11 it says this for only OG the king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Giants behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron is not is it not in rabbath of the children of Ammon nine cubits was the length thereof and four cubits was the breadth thereof after the Cubit of a man so how big is a king-sized bed it's like 6 and 1/2 ft long this man's bed was 13 and5 feet long that's how much bigger they were than even us and you imagine the Israelites were a smaller group of people and then this guy's sleeping on a 13 and 1/2t long bed a big guy and he represented all these Giants out there so this is what these people saw they're like whoa these guys are huge but they forgot what God had done for them so there so it it puts it into context there and then God rebuked them for not trusting him verse 39 there back um in uh chapter one moreover your little ones which he said you said should be a prey and your children which that day had no knowledge between good and evil they shall go hither tither and unto them will I give and they shall possess it so he's telling again he's telling them that your children are the ones that go over as I said none of this is new Moses is repeating what he had preached all through this journey and these are his closes statements this is the last thing that he's saying but as for you turn you and take your Journey Into the Wilderness by the way of the Red Sea then they answered and said unto me we have sinned against the Lord and we'll go up and fight now he's talking about Kadesh Baria we will go up and fight according to all that the Lord commanded us and we when ye had gted up GED on every man as weapons of war you were ready to go up into the hill now let me explain here what's going on Moses is again repeating what what had happened when they were at C Cades baras so they went across they chickened out and then they come back and Moses said none of you is going to go over and they're like wait a minute we change our mind uh we can do it we can go battle them you know God was with us he was the Red Sea the man of following yeah we can go do it and God said no you won't God said you're finished because now if you go over and try to fight these Giants guess who's not going to be with you me and you will die if I'm not with you so Moses is telling that story again to these people so then in chapter three Moses was commissioned um in chapter 3 Moses tells the perspective of what had happened when he brought the people out of Egypt and he says this chapter 3: 23 and I besought the Lord at that time I'm sorry this is when I uh let me let me something's bothering me I don't know what it is can you tell let me just I want to I'll just come down a minute I don't know the enem is enem is here for some reason let's just bow our heads for a minute father I feel off for some reason Lord I pray that whatever it would be that maybe I got out of your will Lord maybe I'm nervous feel odd but Lord I feel like I've strayed I pray father that youd bring me back to the path and Lord set this service straight now I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen sometimes it's good to just stop and say Lord I feel like I've done something wrong I don't know what I did and Lord would you maybe put me back on the path of of what he wants for this service tonight Moses was as Moses is preaching this sermon to the people it was so important to him that this was his whole life that was coming to an end and this book of Deuteronomy these these sermons that he was preaching right here this was everything this was this was it all of the Miracles that had happened it had came to this point where Moses is there and he's preaching to this next Generation to come and he's saying don't stray from what I've told you Don't Stray From This law this law is there to help you take care listen to it all read it day and night talk about it in in your living rooms around your family tell them about it and your families now they're gone because they sinned and now you this next generation will you follow God's word will you do what he said and here they are listening to Moses many of them probably didn't witness the pillar of fire way back way back earlier many of them weren't none of them were there with the plagues and all this they were just they had just been told stories and now here they are this next generation and they are chosen to go over with this man Joshua and let me tell you there was a great obstacle on the other side of this Jordan River and here they are Moses is trying to get them in the spirit to serve God and he's saying don't forget what I have told you don't forget these things so in chapter 3 he was reiterating these stories verse number 28 he says this he says but charge Joshua and encourage him and strengthen him he's going to be your new leader for he shall go over before the people and he shall cause them to inherit the land which Thou shalt see so we Abode in the valley over against bethor now Moses right here he's laying the foundation for his successor he's telling the people listen I'm leaving but follow him he's the one that's going to lead you over and he's telling the people to keep this law as they go into the land because if they don't they will end up the same way as their parents did Deuteronomy chapter 4 verse five Moses again warning as I was reading this I was thinking Moses has a very corrective Ministry Moses he he really tells him he's like listen you're Sinners and he says come out of that he says if you'll just serve God then you'll do well chapter 4 verse 5 he says this behold I have taught you statutes and judgments even as the Lord my God commanded me that that you should do so in the land whether you go to possess it keep therefore and do them for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the Nations which shall hear all these statutes and say surely this nation is a wise and understanding people what a lesson so he's saying you're different he's saying the word of God is what separates you from the rest of the world and we look at this today that's what separates a Christian from the rest of the world it's the same lesson as Moses is teaching right here we are different we are called out we don't act like the world we don't talk like the world we don't worship the idols like they did over in Canaan over on the other side of Jordan we we need to be separate from that and that's what this law has done it has taught us not to do these things very very important lesson he says that you're a great nation and you're wise in understanding because of not you but because of the law because of the word that that I brought Moses speaking that's why you're special not because of anything else but because of this word is why you're special oh then he says this is beautiful for what nation is there so great who hath God so nigh unto them as the Lord Our God in all things that we call upon him for what people have God so close to them as you do wow brother Hy what a statement you're different you're close to God because you believe his word and you're acting on his word and what nation is there so great that has statutes and judgments so righteousness so righteous as all the law which I set before you this day again you're different you're not of this world you're a separated people because of the word only take heed to thyself and keep thy Soul diligently lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen unless they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life but teach them thy sons and thy Sons Sons teach this law walk in this law and you will do well very very very important thing brother Aaron he's he's sick today he called me this morning and he was he was telling me a testimony from yesterday I was down in Douglas yesterday and we were coming back and we saw on the um on the Google Maps that there was a wreck there I think is around AA Road well brother Aaron was was was was driving in was driving down I 10 and it slowed down and brother Aaron told me he said then everything slowed down and he said then the traffic started to speed up and brother Aon brother Aon accelerated and he said wait a minute he said the law says 55 brother Aaron got up to 55 miles an hour and everybody started blowing by him and then right in front of brother Aaron the wreck happened a big tractor trailer jack knife brother Aaron said if I was going the same speed as everyone else I would have hit that truck there would have been no way but he was following the law do you see how the law was given for our safety the law was given for our benefit and then brother Aaron called me he's like he said brother Daniel he says this is exactly like Deuteronomy and and and he says I prayed I said Lord I bet you he's going to talk about that tonight and there's brother Aaron and he said he say this was exactly what it says right there if he wouldn't have followed the law he would have suffered often we try to take the Torah the law and we try to apply it exactly to our lives but that doesn't work there's there's laws about how you cut your beard there's laws about things you would wonder you'd be like well why does that matter but it is important it was very very important back then and it's just as important today that we take the law we take the word and we do our best to apply it to our lives and we might think we might look back to this book of Deuteronomy and we might back look back to the people and we say oh they live this holy life and this very legalistic life then they must be they must have been more they must have been very very clean but today friends we should be more clean than they were back then they had the law they had the the rule book there which was was sent there to take care of them like brother Aaron with the 55 mph speed limit very important but now that law has become flesh in us and we become one with that law so no we don't live less of a life than them we live more holy than they lived we are more responsible today than they were back then they had this book of the law now this law is in us and it should be applied in everything that we do the law was limited I mean you couldn't write enough books to cover every single thing but now this word of God is here and it applies George to everything we do to to driving to to what you look at at to what you look at on your phone to to everything that's not written there because these times have changed but now the law is here and it makes our it judges everything so we are able to make these decisions all the time what a story with brother Aaron and what he said and it was a perfect timing do Deuteronomy is mentioned in the Old Testament it's quoted this is how important it was 350 times and it's mentioned in the New Testament 95 times so you hear so much oh well that's Old Testament that almost like it doesn't matter it doesn't apply to today well then why would the New Testament authors write quote it 95 times it's very very important times change but this word doesn't change change then I've read also Jesus quotes from Deuteronomy more than any other book in the Torah that's how important this book is this is a summary of Moses's ministry here then we move on Deuteronomy chapter 5 to 11 they're really about to Ten Commandments and living according to the law that Moses brought down from Mount Si and it's telling this generation to be more faithful and more consecrated than the previous generation um maybe I'll stop right there for a minute the young people and um my kids all of us we look back back at previous generations and we look boy they lived more holy than we live you look at the way they dressed you look at their what they did as far as their activities you look back in the 30s and 40s you know what the biggest the the the biggest Gatherings of people were back then they were Church meetings they weren't 100,000 people at a Nebraska football game they were ministers and preachers go and having these meetings and the people coming in and worshiping the Lord and that's where they would meet their husbands and that's where they meet their wives now look at today and there's very little that we have 30 40 50 people here tonight that's not the way it was back then but it started with entertainment with a television and then it then it went on to to the internet and and and all of this stuff I'm not condemning anything but I'm saying that this generation here can look back and say look how holy they were but let me tell you something this generation right here needs to be more holy because they didn't they didn't go they didn't go over Jordan to the promised land so we should be more holy living a better life than them Daniel if I go before the Lord comes you have to live a better life than I did George you have to live better than that generation before cleaner Holier and we think how could that be but it has to be there will be a generation that Witnesses the second coming of Christ I pray that it's mine I pray brother Eli I want to be there I want to see that but if I don't attain to that level somebody has to it's going to happen and let this generation do it and don't never look back at that old generation and look how holy they were because we have to be more than they do it's a it's a thought and it's exactly what Moses was telling them they're the generation that witnessed the Red Sea part and all the plagues come down on Egypt and Pharaoh Fallen to his knees that were the generation witnessed that and yet they they failed they sinned and the Next Generation rose up was more holy than them I read this before I want to read it again this is a shama this is the prayer after Moses wrote this in the book of Deuteronomy the the the rabbis and the priests they started reading this and it's even read today very famous prayer daily right every day they say this here o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and thou shalt talk of them when thou sest in thine house and when thou walst by the way and when thou liest down when thou riseth up and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand and they shall be as the F the frontlets between thine eyes and thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house thy house and on thy Gates always keep the word of the Lord before you and in front of your face skip to verse 16 it says this ye shall not tempt the Lord your God as ye tempted him in Massa ye shall diligently keep the Commandments of the Lord your God and His testimonies and his statutes when he which he hath commanded thee and thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the Lord that it may be well with thee and that thou mayest go and possess the good land which the Lord swear unto thy fathers to cast out all thine enemies from before thee as the Lord has spoken and when thy son asketh thee in time to come saying what mean the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments which the Lord Our God commanded you then Thou shalt say unto thy son we were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and the Lord showed signs and wonders great and sore upon Egypt and upon pharaoh and upon all his household before our eyes and he brought us out from then that he may bring us in to give us the land which he swear unto our fathers and the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes to fear the lord Our God for our God our for our good always that he might preserve Us Alive as it is to at this day and it shall be our righteousness if we observe to do all these Commandments before the Lord Our God as he hath commanded us look at this law the this this walk with the Lord this strict lifestyle that we live it's for our own good as I said before Aaron Gar is cruising along at 55 all of the cars are going by him something tells him no it's 55 and then there's a wreck but he was following the law chapters 12- 16 are a collection of laws in the center of book with talking about the temple of God in Deuteronomy 14 one interesting thing about Deuteronomy 14 that that uh really blessed me as I was reading it talks about tithing and the word tithe means a tenth so it instructs the people to give a tenth of their income come every year but then every three years take another tenth and give it to the poor I thought wow I never knew that that and and that's that's the way God instructed and then that way that every year somebody's it's their turn to give to the poor so there's always money there for the poor to support the poor and then their tithing also it's a beautiful story and it's it shows that even way back God was mindful of those that can't take care of themselves God was mindful of the widows he was mindful of the orphans he was mindful of those that need help from the generosity of the people and in this case every three years take another 10% and give I'm not trying to start a Doctrine by the way I'm just trying to explain the Book of Deuteronomy then chapter 16 it outlines the character of the leadership the elders and the priests they were all placed within the authority of the law and then it says that he will send prophets to make sure that these laws are being followed these future prophets they'll be like Moses and they'll set things straight not only with the the priesthood they'll set things straight with the government morally and throughout everyone these prophets will show up on the scene and cry out against sin Deuteronomy 18:13 very very important scripture right here Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord thy God for these nations which which Thou shalt possess hearken under The Observers of time and unto divers but as for thee the Lord thy God hath not suffered thee to do so so he says don't get caught up with these false prophets and these wi Wizards and these Witch Doctors the Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee of thy Brethren like unto me unto him you shall hearken according to all that thou desirest of the Lord thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly saying let me not hear again the voice of the Lord my God neither let me see this great fire anymore that I die not remember when they were at the mountain and they got scared because of all the noise and all the fire and everything they said don't let God speak we want to hear a prophet God never forgave him for that but from that point on and here's what Moses is saying from that point on God spoke through these prophets and the Lord said unto me they have well spoken that which they which which they have spoken I will raise them up a prophet from among their Brethren like unto thee and I will pour my words in his mouth and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him do you know what he's talking about let's turn to acts he's talking about the future prophets but let's turn to Acts chapter 3 verse 18 believe this is Peter speaking says this but those things which God before had sh by the mouth of All His prophets that Christ should suffer he has so fulfilled repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord and He Shall send Jesus Christ which before was preached to you what does Peter mean before it means a long time before whom the Heaven Must receive until the times of restitution of all things which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began so all these prophets every Prophet that ever lived was talking about the same thing for Moses now we're GNA hear what I just said in Deuteronomy Peter says this for Moses said unto the fathers a prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you and it shall come to pass that every soul which will not hear that Prophet shall be destroyed from among the people yay and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these days so Peter is saying that all the prophets in including Moses are talking about the time when this man Jesus Christ would come ye are the children of the prophets and of the Covenant which God made with our fathers saying unto Abraham and thy seed and in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed unto unto F unto you first God having raised up his son Jesus sent him to bless you and turning away every one of you from his iniquities Peter is saying that Christ first came to Moses's people Abraham's people Israel's people the Jews now let's go back to Deuteronomy chapter 18 beautiful how Moses prophesied of this man Jesus that was to come verse uh Deuteronomy 18:19 and it shall come to pass now now Moses is speaking again and it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which shall which he shall speak in my name I will required of it him so he's saying listen to the prophets or else you're going to answer for it but this is very important that Prophet must be a true Prophet but the prophet which shall presumed to speak a word in my name which I have not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the name of other gods even the prophet even that Prophet shall die so the stakes are very high in this Old Testament and if thou sh thou say in thine heart how shall we know the word of the Lord hath not how shall we know the word which the Lord hath not spoken a very very important question so if somebody's prophesying a man is claiming to be a prophet how do we know he is or isn't no matter how good of a Preacher he is some of them are are some of the greatest preachers around no matter even doesn't even say if he's doing Miracles or whatever he's doing how do we know that this man that's prophesying is or isn't a prophet when a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord if the thing follow not nor come to pass that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken but if the Prophet hath spoken it presumptuous Thou shalt not be afraid of him so if a so-called Prophet man with a prophetic gift speaks a prophecy and it doesn't come to pass then don't believe him and Friends remember that probably many of us have seen that happen no matter as I said no matter how great of a Preacher he is no matter how much charisma he has no matter what his ministry how can he how he can explain the word if he prophesize and it doesn't come to pass it says don't be afraid of that man and many of those men they rule with fear they say listen to me they may even call themselves a prophet or others will call him a prophet but if he says something that doesn't come to pass don't be afraid of that and there's there's all kinds of those out there right now but if that prophecy doesn't come to pass then everything else really is out the window chapters 19- 26 laws about marriage family widows orphans businesses all kinds of everyday life also more laws about worship and again these laws they separate they set Israel apart from the rest of the world so when they go over into Canaan land they're going to be amongst a bunch of idolators they're going to be a bunch of among a bunch of just worldly people that don't have values and he's saying that this is what separates you from those people then 27 through 34 Moses Moses issues a challenge to Israel to listen to and and to love God and I'll I'll skip down to um 30 chapter 30 and Moses says really just a beautiful thing here he says that no matter how bad you've done no matter how bad you've sinned no matter how much you've failed that God will restore if you will just surrender to him de Deuteronomy chapter 30 it says this and it shall come to pass when all these things are come upon thee the blessing and the curse which I have set before thee and that thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations whether the Lord thy God hath driven thee and shall return unto the Lord thy God and shall obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day thou and thy children with all thine heart and with all thy Soul so once you've suffered all these curses you're going to come back and you're going to obey the Lord your God and then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity and have compassion upon thee and will return and gather thee from All Nations whether the Lord thy God ha scattered thee and if thine and if any of thine be driven out of the outmost parts of Heaven from then will the Lord God gather thee and from then he will fetch thee so the the love of God no matter how far Israel goes the Lord the Lord's going to go get go get them and the Lord thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possess and thou shalt possess it and he will do thee good and multiply thee above thy fathers and the Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart and the Heart of thy seed to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul that thou mayest live and the Lord thy God will put all these curses upon thy enemies and upon them that hate thee which persecute thee so now he's talking about he's talking about Israel and he say he says you're going to fail you're going to go into captivity maybe into Babylon or you're going to go and you're going to be spread throughout the world as happened about 2,000 years ago and you're going to go to Germany and you're going to go to Russia and you're going to go to Ukraine but the Lord's going to bring you back and he's going to fight against all of your enemies Hezbollah and Hamas Iran and all those who hate Israel right here's a promise that he's going to fight for them and thou shalt return and obey the voice of the Lord and do all his Commandments Let's uh let's close here I'll skip to Deuteronomy 33 let's Deuteronomy 33 is a blessing that Moses places upon the people of Israel and this is when Moses's Ministry is coming to a close and he has all of these people before him and 33 you know what just in honor of Moses let's read it and this is the blessing wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death and he said the Lord came from SI and Rose up from seir unto them he shined forth from the Mount of perin and he came with 10 thousands of saints from his right hand from his right hand when a fiery Loft for them yeah he loved the people and all his Saints and all his Saints are in thy hand and they sat down at thy feet everyone shall receive of thy words Moses commanded us a law even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob and he was King in jesun when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together let Ruben live and not die let not his men be a few now he's he's laying a blessing on all the 12 tribes and this is the blessing of Judah that he said here Lord the voice of Judah and bring him unto his people let his hands be sufficient for him and be thou and help to him from his enemies and Levi he said let thy Thum and thy urum be with the Holy One whom thou didst prove at MSA and with whom thou did US strive at the Waters of merbah who said unto his father and to his mother I have not seen him neither did he acknowledge his Brethren nor knew his own children for they have observed Thy word and kept thy Covenant and thou shalt teach Jacob thy judgments and Israel thy law they shall put incense before thee and the whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar bless Lord his substance and accept the work of his hands Smite through Smite through the loins of them that rise against him and of them that hate him that they rise not again and of Benjamin he said the Beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by him and the Lord shall cover him all the day long and he shall dwell between his shoulders and of Joseph he said blessed of the Lord be his hand for the precious things of Heaven for the Dew and for the deep that couches beneath and for the precious fruits brought forth by the Sun and for the precious things put forth by the moon and for the things for the chief things of the an ancient mountains and for the precious things of the lasting Hills and for the precious things of the earth and fullness thereof and for the Good Will of him that dwelleth in the bush let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his Brethren his glory is like the first thinging of his bulock his horns are like the horns of the unicorns with them he shall push the people together to the end of the Earth and they are the 10,000s of Ephraim and they are the thousands of Manasseh Moses goes on and blesses all the children of of Israel in verse number 28 Israel then shall dwell in safety alone and the Fountain of Jacob shall be upon the hand a a land of corn and wine and also his Heavens shall drop down due happy are thou oh Israel who is like unto thee Oh people saved by the Lord The Shield of thy help and whom the sword and who the sword of thy Excellency and thine enemies shall be found Liars unto thee and thou shalt tread upon their high places now in closing if uh the musicians would come I um I don't know why that uh things went the way that they did tonight um I wanted wanted to read as much as the scripture as I could because we know that our words will fail but if we can read our Bibles that those are God's words and God blesses his word and these last this last chapter of Deuteronomy it's probably not written it's not written by Moses but it is written probably by his contemporary Joshua and the man that would take the message and take the people and go over Jordan into God's Promised Land it says this chapter 34 and Moses went up from The Plains of Moab into the mountain of Nebo to the top of pisga that is over against Jericho and the Lord showed him all the lands of Gilead unto Dan and all Nepali and the land of of Ephraim and Manasseh and all the land of Judah unto the utmost sea and and the South and the plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm trees unto zor and the Lord said unto him this is the land which I swear unto Abraham and to Isaac and unto Jacob saying I will give unto thy seed I have caused thee to set it with thine eyes but Thou shalt not go over tither so Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab according to the word of the Lord and he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab over against bethor but no man knoweth of his supplier unto this day even Lucifer even Satan himself doesn't know where Moses was buried it says right here that God buried his servant Moses imagine he goes up on that mountain and had a time with the Lord the old man walked up I wonder what happened God he couldn't go over Jordan he goes over in private and this greatest Prophet that's in the entire Old Testament did more than anyone else had done he had just given his ending sermons to these people this next Generation the first generation had died out and he goes gave it everything that he had and he goes to be with the Lord and the Lord himself buried Moses and Moses was 120 years old when he died died his eye was not dim nor his natural force abated and the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab 30 days so that the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended and Joshua the son of nun was full of the spirit of wisdom for Moses had laid his hands upon him and the children of Israel hearkened unto him and did as the Lord commanded Moses and there arose not a prophet since since in Israel like unto Moses whom the Lord knew face to face and all the signs and the Wonders which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt to pharaoh and to all his servants and all his land in all that Mighty hand and in the great Terror which Moses showed in the sight of Israel I uh I don't think I know that even Satan himself he hates these words of Moses and he attacks against anyone who would read these blessed scriptures that have carried for thousands of years to this day and friends this Old Testament of the book of the law it's just as true today as it was the day it was written Moses this great man and all that he did right here it all ended up on that mountain and this concludes the Torah this concludes the first five books of the Bible this concludes the um writings of Moses it's quoted probably is the most talked about Prophet even today that has ever lived and um I got to tell you his his message is if people would live if they would have just lived by Moses's message and really done what he taught they wouldn't have had all the troubles that they had so again friends I uh felt like something was going on tonight that I don't know what it was I I know I've never said that before as you know um but I pray that you got something out of the closing of of God's word and these writings of Moses it's a closing as I said before Deuteronomy it wasn't anything new it was Moses re re iterating what he had already said and what he had already taught before and this was a series of sermons that he preached to try to get the people to live for the Lord and to be right amen you believe Moses's words you believe every word that's in this book brother George what do you want to do you still feel you still feel to go up here let me tell you brother George never met before we talked on the phone earlier today and um he he said that he had it in his mind if I'm right that if I mentioned baptism to him that he knew that that would be the step that he would take tonight and it was one of the first things I mentioned to him brother George is a Christian I can tell he's a Christian I can tell brother George has had an exper experience in his life and he told me as we were out there talking he said did you say something like this would be the final step this is this was this completes that journey and it does friends there is a time we we need to all come through that journey and as Moses said in this book he said God will circumcise your heart this outward circumcision it was a type of the real thing which is cutting off the flesh the extra flesh of this heart and really serving God with all everything that's in us that we may be a pure and willing vessel for God's spirit to enter into our lives and then that law that I just read about becomes flesh walking talking word of God God the word and the person becomes one baptism brother George is such an important part of that the Apostle Peter he commanded he knew that this baptism that it was something that had been a tradition in the Jewish culture that this baptism meant that they were going that they were going to repent and make a change in their lives and this John the Baptist came the Forerunner of Jesus Christ he came to introduce Christ and he goes out there and he is baptizing in this Jordan River and and the people saw hey there's something about this guy why are you baptizing why do the people repent it's because he was a prophet and then Jesus comes into the water with John John baptizes him and he comes out and then the Holy Spirit comes down and rests upon the Messiah and then he goes into the Wilderness for 40 days and that's the same in our baptism Peter was recalling all of these things and he filled with the Holy Spirit the day of Pentecost had just come and the Holy Spirit was living inside of Peter the book as I said became real and now living in a man and it wasn't just studying it it wasn't just learning it and regurgitating what you had learned now it became real to Peter and He commands the people in Acts chapter 2 I can quote it I don't need to read it but if you could put it up on the on the screen acts chap 2: 38 says this Now 37 says that when Peter had preached this Jesus Christ they had they were cut in their hearts said there's something real about what this man is preaching and then they go to Peter and they said what was must we do Peter says this and he said it to all of them he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ Christ for the remission of your sins the remission of your sins means the taking away of your sins and then you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost it's a promise that you will receive this same gift that we had in the upper room and he had just come out of the upper room and now was preaching it verse 39 says for This Promise is unto you and to your children and them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call George that's you and that's me it wasn't just for them 2,000 years ago it's for you and me that we can go into this pool and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ with the power of Jesus Christ and then a promise that this Spirit as it did that the day of Pentecost would come into us as it did to them and then we would be set aside side for service to preach this gospel to witness of this gospel to live this gospel as Moses had instructed these people in the wilderness he said go and live it live this law live this law and don't make any mistakes it was impossible for them to do it before but now because of Christ has come now it is possible to live that same law that Moses taught this day it's possible brother if if you could uh meet brother Lyall back there just go right back there brother Lyall will show you where to go and I will come up and meet you up there brothers and sisters just for one minute God is so good he is great he commanded us to live this word and we can't do it the law just reading the law and trying to live every word we can't do it until that Spirit comes into us that Holy Spirit and then we live it and then we can do it and then when we fail it's like Lord I failed and he says I know but he looks and he says you didn't fail there was somebody who failed that took your failures over here and he answered for it that perfect sacrifice and that is God's word word that is made flesh within us that we might live this word God bless you brothers and sisters I'll uh go up can you believe more isn't this great the first person I baptized the very first person I baptized here there was somebody sitting out outside the door and they were listening to a sermon that I preached on phiman phiman and uh onesimus onesimus was this man that was in that was in prison and the person that I baptized he had just gotten out of prison and he was listening outside door wouldn't even come into the congregation and he said hey the the sermon you just preached I just got out of prison he says I want to be baptized right now and I said well do you want to wait till Sunday he says now and that's the same thing this brother just said to me he said I need it right now he said that before service

to be back tell about the vision I used well I'd say my kid's mother she's a Christian as well so when I started going to church with her within like two weeks I had a vision or a dream where I was just looking at some somebody and he'd keep on like just waving his hand to follow him but I couldn't see I was just barely barely seeing him I couldn't see his face and I told them about this vision and they told me no it can't be it's just your imagination and I'm like I don't think so it didn't feel like imagination to me I'm pretty sure that was the Lord and he he wanted me to follow him a long time ago but I decided to try things out my way and do things my way and they and it doesn't work you just get more lost yes sir amen you our brother when I when I back went back there I said
