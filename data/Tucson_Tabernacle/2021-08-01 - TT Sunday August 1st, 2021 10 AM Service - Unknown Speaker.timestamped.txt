[45:28] his greetings and from my wife
[45:30] who would have liked to have come with
[45:32] me but and we'd actually planned that
[45:34] and
[45:35] purchased the tickets and then she
[45:38] remembered that there was a funeral
[45:39] planned this weekend for her
[45:42] her co-worker's husband and so she was
[45:45] unable
[45:46] to come this time but if the lord would
[45:48] permit in the future
[45:49] for us to come back we'll bring her with
[45:51] us and uh
[45:53] you can get to meet her and enjoy the
[45:55] fellowship with her but
[45:56] we just love the lord this morning amen
[45:58] trust you've come to
[46:01] hear from him and receive from him i'll
[46:03] invite you to turn with me
[46:04] in your bibles to colossians chapter 1.

[46:10] like to say i really enjoyed
[46:11] the worship service this morning and
[46:15] the songs the selections had just just
[46:18] really blessed my heart and
[46:23] know the lord many times as a minister
[46:26] when you feel the lord has inspired you
[46:29] in a certain direction
[46:30] uh and then you watch that song service
[46:33] and
[46:34] having no you know collaboration or uh
[46:37] agreement there with the song leader but
[46:39] see the holy spirit is guiding

[47:03] go to the lord in prayer just before we
[47:05] read his word

[50:26] every creature for by him were all
[50:29] things created that are in heaven
[50:31] and that are in earth visible and
[50:34] invisible
[50:35] whether they be thrones or dominions or
[50:38] principalities or powers
[50:41] all things were created by him
[50:44] and for him amen and he is before
[50:48] all things and by him all things consist
[50:53] he is the head of the body the church
[50:57] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[50:59] the dead
[51:00] that in all things
[51:04] he might have the preeminence amen
[51:08] as you're seated this morning we'll ask
[51:10] the lord to bless the reading of his
[51:12] word
[51:13] and i want to speak uh this morning for
[51:16] a subject or for a title
[51:18] god's prevailing desire
[51:22] god's prevailing desire and we know that
[51:25] the the words that we have read this
[51:27] morning from colossians chapter 1
[51:30] paul is describing
[51:33] this preeminence of christ in
[51:36] in his body in his church and we believe
[51:38] we're a part of that this morning amen
[51:40] by the grace of god
[51:42] and also i just want to refer to another
[51:45] scripture
[51:46] in isaiah chapter 9 verses 6 and 7
[51:50] where it says there i know you're
[51:52] familiar with this for unto us a child
[51:54] is born
[51:55] unto us a son is given and the
[51:58] government
[51:59] shall be upon his shoulder and his name
[52:01] shall be called
[52:02] wonderful counselor the mighty god
[52:05] the everlasting father the prince of
[52:08] peace we know these scriptures
[52:10] are speaking of jesus christ who at this
[52:13] time
[52:14] it's a promise it's a coming isaiah is
[52:17] prophesying of god coming to earth in
[52:21] the form
[52:22] of human flesh amen as a person and then
[52:25] he says in verse 7
[52:26] he says of the increase of his
[52:29] government
[52:30] and peace shall be no end
[52:33] and i believe we'll see this morning as
[52:35] we go into this message
[52:37] that we are a part of that government we
[52:40] are part of that kingdom paul said he
[52:42] has translated
[52:43] us into the kingdom of his dear son
[52:46] and then isaiah says of the increase of
[52:49] his government and peace
[52:50] there shall be no end amen there will be
[52:53] a continual increase of it
[52:55] amen all through eternity upon the
[52:59] throne of david and upon his kingdom to
[53:01] order it and to establish it with
[53:03] judgment
[53:04] and with justice from henceforth even
[53:06] forever
[53:07] the zeal of the lord of hosts
[53:10] will perform this amen i
[53:14] can rest this morning and have
[53:15] confidence that it's not my desire
[53:18] it's not my zeal it's not my ability
[53:21] it's not my works
[53:23] amen but isaiah said the zeal of the
[53:26] lord of hosts
[53:27] will perform this amen when when jesus
[53:30] asks his disciples in matthew chapter 16
[53:33] whom do men
[53:34] say that that i am amen they said some
[53:37] say thou art
[53:38] elias or jeremias or one of the prophets
[53:41] and he said but whom
[53:42] say ye that i am and peter said thou art
[53:44] the christ
[53:45] the son of the living god amen and jesus
[53:48] told peter
[53:49] blessed art thou simon bar jonah for
[53:51] flesh and blood has not revealed it unto
[53:53] you
[53:53] but my father which is in heaven and
[53:55] upon this rock i'll build my church
[53:58] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[54:00] against it
[54:01] amen it's it's a work that he is doing
[54:04] it's a determination of his amen
[54:06] and we're included in that and we're a
[54:09] part of that but we can't
[54:10] fail any more than he can fail amen
[54:13] because
[54:14] it's his working it's his doing when
[54:17] when jesus was here on the earth and
[54:20] uh through his earthly journey and his
[54:22] earthly ministry we know
[54:24] that as as he began his ministry here
[54:28] upon the earth
[54:29] he invited 12 disciples
[54:32] to be a part of that ministry and and he
[54:35] called them from all backgrounds and all
[54:38] walks of life and he lived with them
[54:42] he journeyed with them he ministered
[54:44] before them and he
[54:45] even gave them a part of that ministry
[54:48] themselves to go out
[54:50] amen and to for his ministry to exercise
[54:53] itself
[54:54] through their lives here upon the earth
[54:57] but then he he comes to them one day
[55:00] and he tells them something he says it's
[55:02] expedient for you
[55:04] that i go away and i would imagine
[55:08] you know even looking on that today and
[55:11] much more so
[55:12] being those disciples we could we could
[55:15] ask and and no doubt they may have asked
[55:17] how could it be any better for us
[55:21] that he would go away i mean
[55:25] everything we are today is a result
[55:29] of him having invited us and called us
[55:33] from our background and from the way of
[55:36] life that we knew before him
[55:38] and just being invited by him
[55:42] and being joined to him and having uh
[55:45] this fellowship that we've had in this
[55:48] relationship
[55:49] with him over these last three or three
[55:51] and a half years
[55:52] has transformed our lives into
[55:55] everything
[55:55] that we are how could him leaving us
[56:00] be any better than what we have
[56:03] enjoyed over these last three and a half
[56:05] years of our lives
[56:07] but he told them and it was it was true
[56:10] nonetheless
[56:11] amen despite how difficult it may have
[56:14] been
[56:14] for them to believe that there was
[56:17] something greater
[56:19] than even they had experienced up until
[56:22] that time
[56:23] amen there was something greater that
[56:25] his death his burial
[56:27] his resurrection and his ascension was
[56:30] going to make possible
[56:31] and we want to look at that this morning
[56:34] because we're enjoying
[56:36] that greater this morning amen by the
[56:38] grace of god and i trust even if you
[56:40] don't
[56:40] realize it or you can't see it just at
[56:43] this moment
[56:44] by the end of this service you'll see
[56:46] amen the greater
[56:47] that he made possible amen was was
[56:50] realized not only by those disciples
[56:53] but by all of the new testament church
[56:55] amen
[56:56] every redeemed son or a son or daughter
[56:58] of god
[56:59] has enjoyed that greater that he sp
[57:02] that he uh promised to them and that he
[57:05] spoke of there when he told them
[57:07] it's expedient for you that i go away
[57:09] now the bible tells us
[57:11] in amos 3 verse 7 surely the lord god
[57:14] will do nothing
[57:16] until but he revealeth his secret unto
[57:19] his servants the prophets
[57:21] this is a principle it's a pattern of
[57:24] god
[57:24] before god does anything
[57:28] he first comes and reveals what he is
[57:31] about to do
[57:32] through the ministry of a prophet amen
[57:35] before god destroyed the earth
[57:37] by water in the flood he came and
[57:40] revealed
[57:40] to a prophet noah what he was about to
[57:43] do
[57:44] and you know to the world that sounded
[57:46] like well for one thing
[57:48] they didn't believe it they didn't
[57:49] believe there was any truth to it
[57:51] but if they believed there was anything
[57:54] to it it sounded like a message of
[57:56] judgment
[57:57] it sounded like a message of punishment
[57:59] amen it sounded like
[58:00] you know the judgments of god were about
[58:03] to be poured out
[58:04] on onto the earth and indeed they were
[58:06] but you know
[58:07] what what what became a message of
[58:10] judgment
[58:10] to the unbeliever was a message of grace
[58:14] to the believer amen because in that
[58:17] same message
[58:18] of of the coming flood was also a way of
[58:21] escape made
[58:23] amen that to get onto the ark that god
[58:25] had instructed noah to build
[58:27] was going to float them amen the same
[58:30] water
[58:30] that would drown the unbeliever was
[58:33] going to lift
[58:34] the believer or the overcomer amen to be
[58:36] spared from the judgments of god
[58:39] so god would do nothing until he first
[58:41] revealed it
[58:42] by unto a prophet in the earth same in
[58:46] moses day
[58:47] amen before amen god poured out his
[58:50] wrath and his judgment
[58:51] on egypt he sent a prophet he sent a
[58:54] prophet to prepare a people
[58:56] for what god was about to do and so i'm
[58:59] thankful we're living in the hour
[59:02] that god is is doing something in the
[59:04] earth
[59:05] amen but before he does it he sent a
[59:07] message
[59:08] to reveal it through a prophetic
[59:10] ministry and one of the things that
[59:12] the prophet of god has brought to us in
[59:15] this
[59:16] hour was that before time began
[59:20] before the world was formed before
[59:23] anything was
[59:24] spoken into existence god in his mind
[59:28] had a plan god had a purpose
[59:33] amen god had desires that he wanted
[59:36] to express and in this message
[59:40] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[59:43] the prophet of god begins to describe
[59:45] a threefold purpose of god that
[59:49] has been contained or has been hidden
[59:52] in the mind of god since the foundation
[59:55] of the world
[59:56] and through all of time through all of
[59:59] the creation
[1:00:00] it meant through through the the through
[1:00:02] man coming to earth and
[1:00:04] time unfolded in the fall of man and the
[1:00:07] redemption of man
[1:00:08] through the old testament and even
[1:00:09] through the new testament ages
[1:00:12] this secret has remained a secret in the
[1:00:15] back part of god's mind
[1:00:17] but now in this hour hallelujah amen in
[1:00:20] this age we're living and in this
[1:00:22] ministry
[1:00:23] god is now ready to reveal something
[1:00:26] that for 6 000 years has been a secret
[1:00:30] and i say this this morning if god's
[1:00:33] revealing something
[1:00:34] he must be about to do something amen if
[1:00:37] god
[1:00:38] is going to unfold or to release or make
[1:00:41] known something
[1:00:42] that has been a secret for 6 000 years
[1:00:46] god is preparing to accomplish something
[1:00:49] god is preparing to express something
[1:00:52] god is preparing
[1:00:53] to unfold something amen that was too
[1:00:56] great
[1:00:56] to be revealed or to be made known or
[1:00:59] for the secret to be let out
[1:01:01] prematurely amen but he's kept it as a
[1:01:03] mystery
[1:01:04] to withhold the the the uh
[1:01:08] i don't i can't even think of the word
[1:01:10] amen just the power
[1:01:12] or the magnificence of what he's about
[1:01:14] to do god has held it in reserve all of
[1:01:16] this time
[1:01:17] but has now made it known amen and so as
[1:01:20] the prophet of god begins
[1:01:22] to describe this he said his first
[1:01:24] desire
[1:01:25] was to reveal himself in jesus christ
[1:01:30] and i'll say this you'll notice as you
[1:01:33] watch how the prophet describes
[1:01:34] this threefold purpose each fold or each
[1:01:38] stage
[1:01:38] of this threefold purpose makes way for
[1:01:41] the next stage
[1:01:43] or makes way for the next fold so god
[1:01:46] came to earth in the person of jesus
[1:01:49] christ
[1:01:50] and god began to reveal himself
[1:01:54] amen reveal his character his nature
[1:01:57] and his attributes in the ministry of
[1:01:59] jesus christ
[1:02:01] and the world and many amen in the world
[1:02:05] missed god revealing himself in jesus
[1:02:09] christ
[1:02:10] they thought he was a man trying to make
[1:02:12] himself equal with god
[1:02:14] but they failed to realize he was god
[1:02:17] making himself
[1:02:18] equal with man amen he was god uh
[1:02:21] lowering himself it was god
[1:02:23] condescending himself
[1:02:24] to come to earth and express himself in
[1:02:27] a form that
[1:02:28] we could realize in a form that that we
[1:02:31] could comprehend
[1:02:32] in something amen in a way that we could
[1:02:34] relate to who god is
[1:02:36] and jesus christ i love how brother
[1:02:38] branham says
[1:02:39] he thought that that god was mad at him
[1:02:42] but christ
[1:02:42] loved him and then he realized that
[1:02:45] jesus
[1:02:46] was the very heart of god expressed
[1:02:49] now you think about that we see god
[1:02:51] revealing himself in wrath
[1:02:53] and in judgment and and we see the great
[1:02:55] and terrible
[1:02:56] even power of god and character of god
[1:02:59] and the judgments of god all through the
[1:03:01] old testament
[1:03:03] but when we when we see jesus christ
[1:03:06] come to the earth
[1:03:07] we see the heart of god expressed
[1:03:10] a god who hated sin but he loved the
[1:03:14] sinner
[1:03:16] and a god who expressed himself amen to
[1:03:19] to
[1:03:20] fishermen and to farmers and to the
[1:03:22] common people of the earth
[1:03:23] and could even go and speak to a woman
[1:03:27] living a life in adultery and
[1:03:29] prostitution
[1:03:30] living a life wrapped in sin and
[1:03:32] entangled in sin
[1:03:33] and yet he could love that sinner he
[1:03:36] could love that man that woman
[1:03:38] and draw them from even the power of sin
[1:03:42] that had gripped their life amen and
[1:03:44] could transform them into his very image
[1:03:47] that was the heart of god expressed amen
[1:03:51] god was revealing himself in jesus
[1:03:54] christ
[1:03:55] amen and so the second fold of that
[1:03:58] purpose
[1:03:58] was to gain the preeminences in his
[1:04:01] church
[1:04:02] and that's where i want to dwell on this
[1:04:04] morning or what to focus
[1:04:06] as god's prevailing desire and this
[1:04:09] great desire of god
[1:04:11] to have the preeminences in his church
[1:04:13] how could he
[1:04:14] achieve the second fold of this purpose
[1:04:17] amen was
[1:04:18] by the firstfold by revealing himself in
[1:04:20] christ
[1:04:21] there would be a church there would be a
[1:04:24] people amen who could understand
[1:04:26] that was god amen that is god
[1:04:29] in the person of jesus christ coming to
[1:04:31] the earth
[1:04:32] amen to die for our sins to take upon
[1:04:35] himself
[1:04:36] amen the the wretchedness of what we had
[1:04:39] become
[1:04:40] to then impart unto us his righteousness
[1:04:44] and all that he is amen to gain
[1:04:48] the preeminences in his church you know
[1:04:50] i believe this morning i'm just simple
[1:04:52] enough to believe if god desires
[1:04:55] to do something he's going to do it
[1:04:59] oh my if god wants to do something
[1:05:02] it's going to get done and if that
[1:05:05] desire would involve you this morning
[1:05:08] if that desire would involve me if that
[1:05:11] desire would involve
[1:05:12] us this morning despite our failures
[1:05:16] despite our weaknesses despite our
[1:05:19] shortcomings and all of our inabilities
[1:05:21] amen i don't have a lot of confidence in
[1:05:24] in my ability
[1:05:25] or even my desires but if this is god's
[1:05:28] desire
[1:05:29] i have the utmost confidence in his
[1:05:32] desire
[1:05:33] and it's his desire this morning amen
[1:05:36] that it's being expressed
[1:05:38] and is being revealed not only as a
[1:05:41] as a concept not only as a thought
[1:05:45] i mean not only a as as just you know
[1:05:48] an idea but it's a reality
[1:05:52] and this reality is being made known in
[1:05:55] his church
[1:05:56] in this hour and i want to say this i i
[1:06:00] when i speak of how god has kept this as
[1:06:02] a secret in the back part of his mind
[1:06:05] for all of these years and all of these
[1:06:07] ages
[1:06:08] amen i believe it has held
[1:06:12] something in reserve that is to be
[1:06:14] realized by the church
[1:06:16] in this day and in this hour in a
[1:06:18] greater way than ever before
[1:06:20] but you'll see as we go on a little
[1:06:21] further he has
[1:06:23] already been expressing this desire
[1:06:26] and he has already been unfolding it
[1:06:29] amen
[1:06:30] since the day of pentecost
[1:06:33] so this word i want to take a moment to
[1:06:36] to look at the definition of this word
[1:06:38] preeminence because
[1:06:39] that's the word that the prophet of god
[1:06:41] used
[1:06:42] to describe this second fold of god's
[1:06:45] threefold purpose was to gain
[1:06:47] the preeminences in his church and
[1:06:51] preeminence there there are three
[1:06:53] definitions that the dictionary gives
[1:06:55] and the first is
[1:06:56] superiority in excellence or
[1:07:00] distinction in something commendable
[1:07:04] superiority in excellence or distinction
[1:07:08] in something that is commendable
[1:07:10] preeminence
[1:07:11] the second deals with precedence
[1:07:15] or priority of place
[1:07:18] superiority in rank or dignity
[1:07:22] and it references the scripture there we
[1:07:24] read in in colossians 1 18
[1:07:26] that in all things he might have the
[1:07:30] preeminence
[1:07:31] in all things he might have
[1:07:35] the precedence or the priority of place
[1:07:39] amen how many believes amen he needs to
[1:07:42] have first
[1:07:43] place in every area
[1:07:47] and every aspect of our lives amen
[1:07:50] that's god's desire is to have that
[1:07:53] the the third definition it gives is
[1:07:56] superiority of power
[1:07:59] or of influence superiority of power
[1:08:04] or influence so you'll hear two words
[1:08:07] that are used two or three words in each
[1:08:11] of these definitions
[1:08:12] superiority precedence
[1:08:16] or priority so all of these terms
[1:08:20] that you hear use to describe
[1:08:23] preeminence
[1:08:24] are relative terms they are
[1:08:28] are terms that are comparing one thing
[1:08:31] to other things
[1:08:33] amen superiority is something that is
[1:08:36] superior
[1:08:37] to other things and
[1:08:40] precedence and priority they all are
[1:08:42] dealing with one thing
[1:08:44] in comparison to others and so
[1:08:48] amen we realize uh precedence or
[1:08:51] priority
[1:08:52] or or superiority is something that
[1:08:56] prevails over others
[1:09:00] something that becomes prominent or
[1:09:02] preeminent
[1:09:04] over others amen and so god
[1:09:07] is desiring to have the preeminence
[1:09:11] there are other there are other powers
[1:09:14] there are other forces
[1:09:15] paul said amen that all principalities
[1:09:19] and powers
[1:09:20] were created by him and for him amen so
[1:09:24] there are other
[1:09:25] there are other forces in play there are
[1:09:27] other powers
[1:09:28] at work but god's desire is to become
[1:09:31] preeminent
[1:09:32] above all those others and then to
[1:09:35] express
[1:09:36] that preeminence in our lives the
[1:09:39] prophet of god begins to describe this
[1:09:41] in the message
[1:09:42] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:09:44] paragraph 141 he says
[1:09:46] the first thing was that god
[1:09:50] wanted to reveal himself to the people
[1:09:54] to the people he couldn't do it as a
[1:09:56] great jehovah god
[1:09:58] who covered all space time and eternity
[1:10:00] he could not
[1:10:02] he is too great to ever be revealed to
[1:10:05] people
[1:10:06] because it would be too mysterious but
[1:10:09] what he wanted to do
[1:10:10] he loved fatherhood for he was a father
[1:10:13] and the only way he could express it
[1:10:16] was to become a son i love that
[1:10:20] the prophet of god didn't say to have a
[1:10:22] son
[1:10:23] he said to become a son i
[1:10:27] i heard a brother years ago
[1:10:30] make this reference he said god didn't
[1:10:31] want to to have a family
[1:10:34] god wanted to become a family
[1:10:38] god wanted to express himself as a
[1:10:40] family amen
[1:10:42] that's the reason jesus kept saying the
[1:10:44] son of man see
[1:10:46] they didn't know what he was talking
[1:10:48] about many of them but now
[1:10:50] you get it see he wanted to express
[1:10:53] himself that was one of his great
[1:10:56] threefold purposes
[1:10:57] was to express himself
[1:11:01] identify himself with
[1:11:04] human beings to reveal himself
[1:11:07] in christ secondly to have the
[1:11:11] preeminence
[1:11:12] in his body of believers see the first
[1:11:16] thing brother brown says he wanted to
[1:11:17] reveal himself
[1:11:18] to the people now he says secondly he
[1:11:21] wanted to reveal himself
[1:11:22] to have the preeminence in his body of
[1:11:25] believers
[1:11:26] that is his bride that he might
[1:11:29] live in people
[1:11:32] oh my amen the whole reason he was
[1:11:36] revealing himself and he was living
[1:11:38] amen jesus said the son of man does
[1:11:40] nothing until the father shows
[1:11:42] him his life amen was the life of god or
[1:11:46] the life of the father
[1:11:47] expressed here on the earth but not only
[1:11:50] to make us look and marvel at what god
[1:11:52] was doing in him
[1:11:53] but to show what god was doing in christ
[1:11:56] he wanted to do in
[1:11:57] every son and daughter of god amen to
[1:11:59] come and live
[1:12:00] in his church in his people amen
[1:12:04] this great purpose now being revealed
[1:12:06] revealing himself
[1:12:08] and having first to reveal himself in
[1:12:10] christ
[1:12:11] the fullness of the godhead bodily how
[1:12:13] many would say that this morning jesus
[1:12:15] christ
[1:12:16] is the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:12:18] revealed
[1:12:19] he says and then to bring that fullness
[1:12:22] of the godhead bodily into a people
[1:12:27] the same fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:12:30] into a people
[1:12:31] that he could have the preeminences the
[1:12:34] oversight and the leading
[1:12:38] i again if god desires to do it
[1:12:43] surely it's going to get done surely
[1:12:46] there's somebody that's going to believe
[1:12:47] amen surely there's going to be someone
[1:12:49] like mary
[1:12:50] be it unto me lord according to thy word
[1:12:54] i don't even understand how you're going
[1:12:55] to do it i i don't understand all
[1:12:58] you know it sounds almost too great for
[1:13:01] the human mind to comprehend but god if
[1:13:03] it's your desire
[1:13:04] lord if it's your will if this is your
[1:13:06] purpose be it unto me
[1:13:08] according to thy word so preeminence
[1:13:12] it it deals with oversight
[1:13:17] it deals with importance it deals
[1:13:20] with superiority and it deals with
[1:13:24] rank and
[1:13:28] through all of the years that i've heard
[1:13:30] the prophet of god
[1:13:31] preach this and describe this to us
[1:13:35] in my mind i always thought of
[1:13:38] preeminence
[1:13:40] in exactly the terms that the dictionary
[1:13:42] gives
[1:13:43] superiority precedence priority
[1:13:47] uh rank dignity you know uh
[1:13:51] we think of these things in human terms
[1:13:54] and paul even talked about how the
[1:13:56] gentiles
[1:13:57] have leaders over them and and you know
[1:14:00] uh
[1:14:01] rank and all of these things we think in
[1:14:03] these ways and that
[1:14:04] has always been the way my mind
[1:14:08] and the way this word preeminence would
[1:14:10] would strike me when i would hear it
[1:14:13] but a number of weeks ago or some time
[1:14:16] back
[1:14:17] this just began going through my mind
[1:14:20] over and over again his desire
[1:14:23] to have the preeminences in his church
[1:14:26] and what what struck me about this or
[1:14:29] what just seemed to
[1:14:31] to come to the the surface of my
[1:14:34] realization was that
[1:14:36] this this term that the prophet of god
[1:14:38] is using this
[1:14:39] this word preeminence yes
[1:14:42] it it deals with all of those things
[1:14:46] but it also deals with
[1:14:50] with dominance where
[1:14:53] there are other influences
[1:14:57] other powers even other attributes
[1:15:02] or other characteristics or qualities
[1:15:06] what it seemed the holy spirit began to
[1:15:09] to impress upon my heart was this
[1:15:12] preeminence
[1:15:13] isn't only dealing with his headship
[1:15:17] and his leadership and and his control
[1:15:21] or or direction or or power because
[1:15:24] you know as as a husband and as a father
[1:15:28] i mean that that husband that father has
[1:15:31] the headship over that home he he is the
[1:15:34] head
[1:15:34] of the body he's the head of the wife
[1:15:37] and so
[1:15:38] you know that deals that deals with more
[1:15:40] than just
[1:15:41] calling all the shots that deals with
[1:15:44] more than just
[1:15:45] making all the decisions you know the
[1:15:47] the pastor
[1:15:48] is is the is the head of the local
[1:15:50] assembly and brother branham says
[1:15:53] the pastor i believe i believe it was
[1:15:55] i'm quoting this right he said the
[1:15:56] pastor has
[1:15:57] the final say but he didn't say the
[1:15:59] pastor has the only say
[1:16:02] amen the the the pastor is the head of
[1:16:05] the body
[1:16:06] but he's listening a good pastor is
[1:16:08] listening to the needs
[1:16:10] and he's listening to the feedback and
[1:16:12] and he's listening to
[1:16:13] how god is is leading the church as a
[1:16:16] body as a whole
[1:16:17] and then he's he's he's taking all of
[1:16:19] that in and then he's saying lord what's
[1:16:21] your direction
[1:16:22] amen what's what's your way amen of of
[1:16:25] responding to these needs
[1:16:28] amen of leading us and guiding us to
[1:16:30] where you're meeting
[1:16:31] all of those needs and so a husband yes
[1:16:34] you know he's the leader
[1:16:35] he's the head but he's more than that
[1:16:37] he's also the provider
[1:16:40] i mean he's he's discerning the needs of
[1:16:42] that family of his wife and of his
[1:16:43] children
[1:16:44] not only their physical needs or or
[1:16:46] their financial needs but also their
[1:16:48] emotional needs
[1:16:50] all of those things so he's he's looking
[1:16:52] at that he's discerning that
[1:16:54] and then it's a channel through which
[1:16:56] those needs are supplied
[1:16:58] and those needs are provided amen as as
[1:17:01] the headship
[1:17:02] or having the preeminence it involves
[1:17:04] that
[1:17:05] it also involves the protection amen now
[1:17:09] think of this in the terms of who
[1:17:10] christ is as hamming the preeminence
[1:17:13] amen
[1:17:14] he's also the provider of the church and
[1:17:16] he's also the protector of the church
[1:17:19] nothing can enter the church that is
[1:17:21] under his headship
[1:17:23] without coming through him first amen
[1:17:25] he's the door to the sheepfold he's the
[1:17:28] great shepherd amen
[1:17:29] every trial every temptation every
[1:17:33] sickness
[1:17:33] everything you desire amen had to first
[1:17:36] come
[1:17:36] through his approval and he only allows
[1:17:40] it to make you stronger
[1:17:42] he only allows it amen to reveal his
[1:17:45] qualities his characteristics his power
[1:17:48] in you
[1:17:50] but here is the other thing that that
[1:17:52] that came to me in this
[1:17:54] i believe that this preeminence
[1:17:58] that the prophet of god is speaking of
[1:18:00] and and
[1:18:01] and describing to us is
[1:18:04] dealing in addition to the headship
[1:18:08] and the leadership and the control i
[1:18:10] believe what god is
[1:18:12] is is showing us is that
[1:18:15] all that christ is
[1:18:19] all of his characteristics
[1:18:22] and all of his qualities are becoming
[1:18:26] preeminent in the lives of
[1:18:30] every one of his sons and daughters
[1:18:34] all of his nature all of his character
[1:18:38] amen all of his healing all of his
[1:18:41] salvation
[1:18:43] all of his love all of his forgiveness
[1:18:48] all that god is and all of his nature
[1:18:50] and it's too
[1:18:51] too majestic for me to describe in human
[1:18:54] terms but
[1:18:55] we understand this morning there is a
[1:18:57] great contrast
[1:18:58] between who he is and who we
[1:19:02] are as as men and women as boys and
[1:19:05] girls
[1:19:06] as human beings amen we're born you know
[1:19:09] i i was
[1:19:10] i was sharing with with someone
[1:19:11] yesterday was sharing the gospel
[1:19:13] with a lady that was uh sitting beside
[1:19:15] me on the airplane
[1:19:17] and i said you know i've my wife and i
[1:19:19] are caring for
[1:19:20] an eight-month-old child a little girl
[1:19:22] and
[1:19:23] our um by the grace of god our
[1:19:26] uh we're designing to adopt her i said
[1:19:30] you know she's just an
[1:19:31] eighth month old child and she's just
[1:19:34] precious as she could be
[1:19:35] but i said we are all born into this
[1:19:38] world
[1:19:39] sinners because of the fall of man in
[1:19:42] the garden of eden
[1:19:44] we have no choice in the manner we're
[1:19:46] born in sin and shape and iniquity
[1:19:48] i said i'll never have to teach her to
[1:19:50] be jealous
[1:19:52] i'll never have to teach her to be
[1:19:54] selfish i'll never have to
[1:19:56] teach her how to shade the truth or hide
[1:19:59] the truth
[1:20:00] because those characteristics are
[1:20:01] already in her
[1:20:04] and she said that child can be jealous
[1:20:08] i had showed her a few pictures of the
[1:20:10] of our baby and i said yes
[1:20:12] i said when when when sister faith
[1:20:15] takes another child and holds her in her
[1:20:17] arms our
[1:20:18] our little girl will begin to cry she's
[1:20:21] getting jealous she wants
[1:20:23] she wants to be held by her mother you
[1:20:25] know and so you can see those things
[1:20:26] expressing themselves
[1:20:28] so how much more so as you grow into a a
[1:20:31] boy and a girl and a young man and a
[1:20:33] young woman
[1:20:34] and then into adulthood you see those
[1:20:37] human characteristics you see that
[1:20:40] that that flesh that sinful
[1:20:44] uh you know those those attributes that
[1:20:46] you're fighting with and you're
[1:20:48] struggling with
[1:20:49] and how great a contrast is that to the
[1:20:52] nature of christ
[1:20:54] yet he is desiring to have the
[1:20:57] preeminence
[1:20:59] it's his desire and through
[1:21:02] amen through the ministering of his word
[1:21:05] and through the ministering of the holy
[1:21:07] spirit
[1:21:09] his desires and his qualities and his
[1:21:12] nature
[1:21:14] is taking preeminence over ours
[1:21:18] and is prevailing amen so that that
[1:21:21] sinful man and that sinful woman that we
[1:21:24] are
[1:21:24] and it doesn't matter how you got it
[1:21:28] it doesn't matter how you obtained it
[1:21:30] you know we can all
[1:21:31] make a list of reasons why we are the
[1:21:33] way we are
[1:21:34] you know it was my environment brother
[1:21:36] tim it it was the way i was raised it
[1:21:38] was my mother it was my father it was my
[1:21:40] grandparents
[1:21:41] there's a whole lineage of people that
[1:21:42] are just this way i was born with this
[1:21:45] but there's a greater power amen there's
[1:21:48] a greater life there
[1:21:49] there's a greater force amen that is
[1:21:52] projecting itself
[1:21:54] amen is presenting itself into the lives
[1:21:57] of men and women who are the sons and
[1:21:59] daughters of god amen
[1:22:01] i love where david said thou hast given
[1:22:03] me the heritage
[1:22:04] of those that fear thy name because i
[1:22:07] believe the psalmist
[1:22:08] looked down through the path of his life
[1:22:10] and he knew how wretched he was
[1:22:12] he knew how sinful he was but he could
[1:22:14] also see those moments
[1:22:16] amen when when another amen another
[1:22:19] power was overcoming him and overtaking
[1:22:21] him
[1:22:22] and he would he could kill the bear and
[1:22:23] he could kill the lion
[1:22:25] and he could kill goliath and even his
[1:22:27] own
[1:22:28] lustful desires and all of those things
[1:22:30] could be overtaken
[1:22:32] by a higher power and a greater nature
[1:22:34] and he said you've given me a heritage
[1:22:37] you've given me the heritage of those
[1:22:39] that fear thy name
[1:22:41] amen so it it amen no matter what our
[1:22:44] reasons or
[1:22:45] what our excuses may be this morning he
[1:22:47] takes them all away
[1:22:49] amen it's him these hiring to express
[1:22:52] himself and so his holiness
[1:22:56] his worthiness his righteousness
[1:23:00] his healing his salvation his
[1:23:04] deliverance
[1:23:05] and then we realize the conditions and
[1:23:08] the challenges that we face in our lives
[1:23:11] give opportunity for his attributes
[1:23:15] to become preeminent and the contrast
[1:23:20] enables us to appreciate his
[1:23:23] preeminent qualities
[1:23:27] paul says in second corinthians 4 verse
[1:23:29] 6 for god
[1:23:31] who commanded the light to shine out of
[1:23:33] darkness
[1:23:34] hath shined in our hearts to give the
[1:23:37] light of the knowledge of the glory of
[1:23:39] god
[1:23:40] in the face of jesus christ and he says
[1:23:43] in verse 7 but we have this treasure
[1:23:45] in earthen vessels that the excellency
[1:23:48] of his power
[1:23:49] may be of god and not of us
[1:23:53] and he says we're troubled on every side
[1:23:57] yet not distressed and we're not immune
[1:24:01] from what's going on in this world
[1:24:04] we we feel the pressure we face the
[1:24:08] challenges
[1:24:09] amen we are we are subject amen to the
[1:24:12] same
[1:24:13] influences we're we're not immune from
[1:24:15] them but he says we're trouble in every
[1:24:17] sign
[1:24:18] yet not distressed amen we are perplexed
[1:24:22] but not in despair we're not without
[1:24:25] hope
[1:24:26] we're not without an answer we're not
[1:24:29] without a source
[1:24:30] amen we're persecuted but not forsaken
[1:24:34] we're cast down but not destroyed always
[1:24:38] bearing about in the body the dying of
[1:24:41] the lord jesus
[1:24:43] that the life also of jesus might be
[1:24:46] made manifest
[1:24:47] in our body for we which
[1:24:51] live are always delivered unto death for
[1:24:53] jesus sake
[1:24:55] that the life also of jesus might be
[1:24:58] made manifest in our mortal flesh
[1:25:02] he says in galatians 2 verse 20 he says
[1:25:05] i am crucified with christ
[1:25:08] nevertheless i live yet not i
[1:25:11] but christ liveth in me and the life
[1:25:15] which i now
[1:25:16] live in the flesh i live by the faith of
[1:25:19] the son of god
[1:25:20] who loved me and gave himself
[1:25:24] for me amen
[1:25:27] you know i i think about isaiah
[1:25:31] and someone had had brought out here
[1:25:32] sometime back
[1:25:34] i heard a brother minister and he said
[1:25:36] you know before
[1:25:38] isaiah had this experience of being
[1:25:42] lift seeing the lord high and lifted up
[1:25:45] isaiah was
[1:25:46] was was giving all of the woes
[1:25:50] woe is israel woe is israel for the
[1:25:53] idolatry and
[1:25:54] their backslidden condition and his eyes
[1:25:57] were on the people of israel and
[1:25:59] in the nation of israel he he was a
[1:26:01] prophet to israel
[1:26:03] and he was seeing all of their faults
[1:26:05] and all of their shortcomings
[1:26:07] but when he was lifted up into god's
[1:26:09] presence
[1:26:10] he wasn't saying woe is israel any
[1:26:12] longer
[1:26:14] he said woe is me
[1:26:17] he said lord i'm undone i'm a man of
[1:26:20] unclean lips
[1:26:22] and i dwell amongst an unclean people
[1:26:25] you know i think
[1:26:26] so many times we have what i call
[1:26:28] comparative religion
[1:26:30] we are comparing ourselves to others
[1:26:33] around us
[1:26:35] and we're looking at their life and
[1:26:36] their condition and and their testimony
[1:26:38] or their walk with the lord and
[1:26:40] you know we we might say well i know i'm
[1:26:42] not as
[1:26:43] i'm not what i ought to be but i'm
[1:26:45] certainly not as bad as
[1:26:47] that person you know that brother that
[1:26:49] sister
[1:26:50] but see when we're called into his
[1:26:52] presence
[1:26:54] and we see who he truly is in the light
[1:26:56] of his glory
[1:26:58] then it puts the focus right where it
[1:27:01] belongs
[1:27:02] amen then we realize it's my own
[1:27:04] condition
[1:27:06] that i need amen that i need to be
[1:27:09] concerned with and that i need him to
[1:27:11] address
[1:27:11] amen and thankful thankfully when isaiah
[1:27:15] when he cried out oh lord amen send an
[1:27:17] angel with a life call from the altar
[1:27:20] to touch my lips amen he knew there was
[1:27:23] a remedy
[1:27:24] for his condition there was a remedy
[1:27:27] amen
[1:27:27] for where he was in his life and i'll
[1:27:29] say this morning the
[1:27:30] only reason god brings you in to his
[1:27:33] presence
[1:27:34] amen to reveal to you your condition to
[1:27:37] bring conviction in your life to show
[1:27:39] you
[1:27:40] i mean your condition i'm so thankful
[1:27:42] this morning
[1:27:43] because we're living in an age that that
[1:27:46] doesn't
[1:27:46] want to really take a real
[1:27:49] self-evaluation
[1:27:50] we're living in an age that says i'm
[1:27:52] rich i'm increased with goods i have
[1:27:54] need of nothing
[1:27:55] amen but their self-evaluation is much
[1:27:58] different
[1:27:59] than god's evaluation of them amen but
[1:28:02] to the true believer
[1:28:03] amen the only reason he brings us into
[1:28:06] his presence
[1:28:07] to show us our true condition as
[1:28:09] contrasted to who he is
[1:28:11] is to show us there's a remedy there's a
[1:28:14] way amen
[1:28:15] amen conviction comes to show you you
[1:28:18] don't have to stay the way you are
[1:28:20] you don't have to remain in that
[1:28:22] condition and you could say oh brother
[1:28:24] tim i'm not lost this morning i'm not
[1:28:26] living in sin i'm not drinking or
[1:28:27] smoking or committing adultery any of
[1:28:29] those things
[1:28:30] but i'll say this morning you don't have
[1:28:32] to remain under that sickness
[1:28:34] you don't have to remain with that
[1:28:36] disease amen you don't have to accept
[1:28:39] the conditions amen that the enemy is
[1:28:41] trying to place on you
[1:28:42] but being brought into his presence amen
[1:28:45] we'll show you a remedy
[1:28:47] we'll show you away amen we'll show you
[1:28:49] an atonement
[1:28:50] that was given a worthy atonement a
[1:28:52] sufficient atonement
[1:28:54] hallelujah a man to bring us into his
[1:28:57] image
[1:28:59] and to the glory of who he is
[1:29:02] a touch from a live coal from the altar
[1:29:05] gave isaiah a reliance on god's
[1:29:08] commission
[1:29:09] god's purpose for his life amen and when
[1:29:13] when god has a purpose for your life
[1:29:15] he'll make a provision for your life
[1:29:18] that his purpose may be fulfilled you
[1:29:20] know moses had a long list of reasons
[1:29:22] why he could never do
[1:29:24] what god was calling on him to do but
[1:29:26] god's
[1:29:27] list was longer than moses amen god's
[1:29:31] ability to perform was greater than
[1:29:33] moses list of excuses
[1:29:34] i'm so thankful for that the the
[1:29:36] commission will prevail
[1:29:38] over our deficiencies or all the
[1:29:41] shortcomings in our life
[1:29:43] amen and it's his desire this morning
[1:29:46] this is god's prevailing desire
[1:29:48] you know it's like for an example it's
[1:29:50] like a sculptor
[1:29:52] would take a block of stone and and
[1:29:54] bring
[1:29:55] you know when it when us when a sculptor
[1:29:58] looks at a
[1:29:59] at that stone at that boulder
[1:30:02] he sees something that you and i don't
[1:30:04] see
[1:30:06] he sees a masterpiece he sees something
[1:30:10] waiting to be brought from that stone
[1:30:13] waiting to be revealed and everyone else
[1:30:15] looks at it says
[1:30:16] i don't see anything there but it's just
[1:30:18] another rock
[1:30:19] it's just another boulder but the
[1:30:21] sculptor sees a masterpiece
[1:30:23] and so he uses his skills and he uses
[1:30:27] the tools that he has
[1:30:29] a man to bring from that rock and from
[1:30:31] what looks like just an
[1:30:32] ordinary stone to the world amen he
[1:30:36] brings from that a masterpiece
[1:30:38] by carving away everything else
[1:30:41] and when you say how did michelangelo
[1:30:43] bring moses from a slab of granite or
[1:30:47] marble he just removed everything that
[1:30:49] wasn't moses
[1:30:51] and when he was done all that was left
[1:30:52] was moses
[1:30:54] it was so how is god going to bring
[1:30:57] himself out of our lives he's going to
[1:30:59] remove everything that's not jesus
[1:31:01] christ
[1:31:02] amen all your temper all your
[1:31:04] selfishness
[1:31:05] amen all of those other things whatever
[1:31:07] it is in your life amen
[1:31:09] he's going to chisel it away he's going
[1:31:11] to he's going to shape everything away
[1:31:13] amen
[1:31:13] until all that is left is jesus christ
[1:31:16] on display
[1:31:18] oh my it's the sculptor that's getting
[1:31:21] the glory
[1:31:22] amen the masterpiece is giving glory to
[1:31:25] the one who sculpted it
[1:31:27] and he is getting the glory from our
[1:31:30] lives this morning
[1:31:31] amen no matter how wretched the
[1:31:33] condition of your life no matter what
[1:31:34] your background and what your past
[1:31:36] amen that's what enables him to receive
[1:31:39] glory
[1:31:41] because the world says i know what he
[1:31:42] used to be
[1:31:44] i know what she used to be but my when
[1:31:46] god got a hold of him
[1:31:48] when god got a hold of her look what he
[1:31:50] made out of her life
[1:31:52] and that gives him glory
[1:31:55] amen god spoke to an earth one day that
[1:31:58] the bible says was
[1:32:00] without form and void and darkness
[1:32:03] covered the face of the deep
[1:32:05] but god had a purpose for that earth
[1:32:08] god there was there was a majestic
[1:32:11] creation
[1:32:12] waiting to be revealed and god spoke to
[1:32:15] that earth
[1:32:17] and god brooded over that earth until
[1:32:20] he until his desire and his purpose
[1:32:23] became preeminent in that earth and yes
[1:32:27] man fell yes man polluted the earth
[1:32:30] yes sin and corruption amen has
[1:32:33] uh has perverted and
[1:32:37] deformed this earth but you know what
[1:32:39] god's not through with this earth
[1:32:42] he's going to bring it back to its
[1:32:44] original glory
[1:32:46] he's not going to discard this planet
[1:32:49] and raise up a new one he's going to
[1:32:50] take this same planet
[1:32:52] and he's going to restore it he's going
[1:32:55] to burn everything away
[1:32:56] amen he's going to destroy those
[1:32:58] atmospheres he's going to do all of
[1:33:00] these things under the sixth seal
[1:33:02] amen so that he can restore this same
[1:33:04] earth
[1:33:05] back to that original glory that he had
[1:33:07] in his mind before he formed the earth
[1:33:10] oh my that should give us confidence
[1:33:11] this morning brother and sister
[1:33:13] amen your life is like that earth amen
[1:33:16] god is desiring
[1:33:17] amen god raised you up for a purpose
[1:33:20] amen when he stooped down and picked you
[1:33:22] up from the maori clay
[1:33:24] he saw a masterpiece he saw a vessel and
[1:33:27] it doesn't matter how long
[1:33:28] amen it doesn't matter how scarred it
[1:33:31] may be it doesn't matter how deformed it
[1:33:33] may be
[1:33:34] god is not going to stop the bible says
[1:33:37] he which began a good work in you
[1:33:39] will be faithful to perform it until the
[1:33:41] day of jesus christ
[1:33:43] he's going to keep working he's going to
[1:33:45] keep moving he's going to keep shaping
[1:33:47] your life
[1:33:48] until your life comes into that glorious
[1:33:51] image that he has in his mind amen
[1:33:54] and he gets the glory from that
[1:34:01] the prophet of god was speaking here in
[1:34:04] the message
[1:34:05] trying to do god a service without being
[1:34:07] the will of god
[1:34:08] and he was talking about the first
[1:34:11] forerunner john the baptist
[1:34:14] and john was you know when john was here
[1:34:18] on the earth they began to ask him are
[1:34:19] you the messiah
[1:34:22] are you the christ and he said i'm not
[1:34:25] him
[1:34:27] but his ministry was had come
[1:34:30] to show the earth now think about this
[1:34:33] for a moment
[1:34:35] john was preaching he's coming
[1:34:39] he's coming there's one coming after me
[1:34:41] who's preferred before me
[1:34:43] but really john's entire life
[1:34:46] and ministry was declaring that he's
[1:34:49] here
[1:34:51] waiting to be revealed waiting to be
[1:34:54] declared
[1:34:55] waiting to be made known or waiting to
[1:34:58] become
[1:34:59] preeminent amen and and john was
[1:35:02] saying he's standing among you
[1:35:06] he's there in in he was there in the
[1:35:08] congregation he was there in the
[1:35:10] multitude
[1:35:12] but to everyone he was just another
[1:35:14] person
[1:35:15] he was just a galilean he was just a
[1:35:17] carpenter's son
[1:35:19] you know he had an unusual birth and at
[1:35:21] that point
[1:35:22] he had there there had been nothing amen
[1:35:25] to to
[1:35:25] to bring him into preeminence but it was
[1:35:29] the holy spirit
[1:35:31] that was going to make him preeminent
[1:35:33] amen and john was
[1:35:34] waiting for the holy spirit amen to come
[1:35:37] and declare unto him
[1:35:38] now it's time amen for him to come to
[1:35:42] the forefront
[1:35:43] and john was saying i must decrease that
[1:35:46] he might increase
[1:35:48] and do you realize this morning that as
[1:35:49] sons and daughters of god
[1:35:51] every one of you have the same role and
[1:35:54] the same commission that john the
[1:35:55] baptist
[1:35:56] had his purpose was to introduce jesus
[1:35:59] christ to the world
[1:36:01] and your purpose as a christian is to
[1:36:04] introduce
[1:36:04] jesus christ to the world amen not as a
[1:36:07] man who walked the shores of galilee two
[1:36:09] thousand years ago
[1:36:11] but jesus christ and the person of his
[1:36:14] redeemed church
[1:36:15] amen jesus christ in your life amen on
[1:36:18] your job at your home in your school
[1:36:21] and whatever your path of life may be
[1:36:23] amen you have the same
[1:36:25] responsibility that john had to declare
[1:36:28] christ to the world
[1:36:29] but you know what you're going to have
[1:36:31] to decrease
[1:36:33] i'm going to have to decrease in order
[1:36:36] that he might increase
[1:36:38] amen and he says john was saying i'm not
[1:36:41] him
[1:36:42] but he is standing among you and his
[1:36:44] shoes i'm not worthy to loosen
[1:36:47] when he comes makes himself known
[1:36:51] then the prophet of god says this and
[1:36:53] remember
[1:36:54] we're on the subject of preeminence and
[1:36:56] today
[1:36:58] he is standing among us
[1:37:01] in the person of the holy ghost
[1:37:04] manifesting his self
[1:37:06] more and more coming into his church
[1:37:09] making his self known
[1:37:11] because him and the bride and the groom
[1:37:14] will be the same
[1:37:15] making his self known and one day you'll
[1:37:18] see that the one you feel in your heart
[1:37:20] and see his identification will become
[1:37:23] personalized before you
[1:37:25] then you and he are one
[1:37:30] you've united by the word and the word
[1:37:32] was in the beginning will go
[1:37:34] back to the beginning which is god and
[1:37:36] that day you'll know that i
[1:37:38] am in the father the father in me
[1:37:41] i in you and you in me
[1:37:45] hallelujah we're here hallelujah
[1:37:48] i'm so glad to see him personifying
[1:37:52] himself right among us
[1:37:55] and see what he's promised for the word
[1:37:57] not with somebody's
[1:37:58] emotion singing and jumping and dancing
[1:38:01] but by his word
[1:38:02] amen he is making himself known
[1:38:06] amen he his life
[1:38:10] his nature his qualities are becoming
[1:38:14] preeminent in our lives
[1:38:17] in the message the unveiling of god he
[1:38:19] says this we
[1:38:21] in him then we being in him
[1:38:25] we are still veiled to the religionists
[1:38:28] and professors of the world see our
[1:38:31] glory that we have
[1:38:32] and enjoying we are still veiled
[1:38:36] to them outsiders they think we're a
[1:38:38] crazy
[1:38:39] a nut again see that's right but we who
[1:38:43] are
[1:38:43] in here in christ baptized into him
[1:38:46] first corinthians 12
[1:38:48] into him we are partakers of this glory
[1:38:52] see but not on the outside you're still
[1:38:55] looking in
[1:38:56] denying it see so now
[1:38:59] we are invited into him to be partakers
[1:39:04] of all that he
[1:39:07] is that in all
[1:39:10] a double l all things he might have the
[1:39:13] preeminence
[1:39:14] and the prophet of god says we are
[1:39:16] invited into him
[1:39:18] to be partakers of all that he is
[1:39:22] we're invited into him which is hid to
[1:39:24] unbelievers
[1:39:26] by the veil of human flesh
[1:39:29] see they know that glory they read of it
[1:39:32] it's in the word here the glory of god
[1:39:35] and things like that
[1:39:36] it's just a word to them to us
[1:39:40] it's a manifestation see it is no more
[1:39:44] a word it's a reality
[1:39:47] amen how many will say this morning it's
[1:39:50] a reality
[1:39:51] it's a reality in my life and i want it
[1:39:53] to become a greater reality
[1:39:56] amen the bible said of the increase of
[1:39:58] his government and peace
[1:40:00] there shall be no end amen god can never
[1:40:03] think of terms he could think in terms
[1:40:05] of condescending
[1:40:06] but he could never think in terms of
[1:40:08] decreasing
[1:40:09] his condescending was in order for him
[1:40:12] to increase
[1:40:13] amen he was on the increase amen in the
[1:40:16] in
[1:40:16] in the book of acts he was on the
[1:40:18] increase in the disciples he was on the
[1:40:20] increase
[1:40:21] in the 120 that came out of the upper
[1:40:22] room but he's been on the increase
[1:40:25] through each of the ages amen even when
[1:40:27] it looked like the church was
[1:40:29] on the decrease god was on the increase
[1:40:32] because all that the cake and worm and
[1:40:34] the local worm
[1:40:35] and the and the caterpillar and the
[1:40:37] pomegranate have destroyed
[1:40:38] i will restore saith the lord amen you
[1:40:42] believe that this morning
[1:40:45] and i want to just i want to stress i
[1:40:48] want to emphasize the power
[1:40:50] of god's word to gain
[1:40:54] the preeminence in the believer it's
[1:40:57] just like brother branham said it's not
[1:40:59] jumping and dancing and shouting now
[1:41:00] we're we're not against those things i'm
[1:41:02] certainly not against
[1:41:03] emotion brother madam said any anything
[1:41:06] that's
[1:41:06] you know anything that doesn't have
[1:41:08] emotion is dead
[1:41:09] we don't want to be dead this morning
[1:41:11] amen but you see it's not
[1:41:13] something that you're producing it's not
[1:41:16] something that you're generating it's
[1:41:17] not
[1:41:18] something that you're working up those
[1:41:20] things
[1:41:21] come as a result of what he is doing
[1:41:24] amen that response that reaction to the
[1:41:27] word of god
[1:41:28] think about how the word of god impacted
[1:41:30] your life
[1:41:31] others heard the same word others heard
[1:41:33] the same shout
[1:41:34] others heard the same message but it
[1:41:36] didn't catch them
[1:41:38] it didn't attract their attention it
[1:41:39] didn't it didn't bring them
[1:41:41] under the influence of its power but
[1:41:43] your life was different
[1:41:44] amen and i believe that word
[1:41:47] has the power and i i believe the
[1:41:50] restoration of the word
[1:41:51] in the hour that we live and the
[1:41:54] revealing of the word
[1:41:56] is giving him the preeminence today in a
[1:41:59] measure
[1:42:00] greater than any previous time
[1:42:03] jesus said in saint john 6
[1:42:07] verse 53 the words that i speak
[1:42:11] unto you they are spirit and they are
[1:42:14] life
[1:42:16] you know when god sent moses when he met
[1:42:19] moses in the burning bush and he spoke
[1:42:21] to him and gave him
[1:42:22] his commission to go to egypt and call
[1:42:25] the children of israel out
[1:42:26] god told moses i am come down
[1:42:31] i am come down i've heard the cry of my
[1:42:34] people
[1:42:35] and i am come down to deliver them
[1:42:38] to those people of the moses ministry
[1:42:43] was the voice of god to fulfill
[1:42:46] his promise that he had given to their
[1:42:48] father abraham
[1:42:50] so when they saw that man and they saw
[1:42:53] that ministry and heard those words
[1:42:54] it was thus saith the lord to them it
[1:42:57] wasn't a man it wasn't a
[1:42:59] you know he wasn't all that egypt
[1:43:01] thought he was
[1:43:03] but he was everything that god had
[1:43:05] called him to be
[1:43:06] and moses wasn't perfect moses life
[1:43:09] wasn't without blemish
[1:43:11] he had murdered an egyptian
[1:43:14] he he had a track record but when god
[1:43:17] got a hold of him
[1:43:19] it made a great difference and they saw
[1:43:22] god in his life and in his ministry and
[1:43:25] they heard the voice of god
[1:43:27] in his words and jesus said the words
[1:43:30] that i speak unto you
[1:43:32] they are spirit they are life he says in
[1:43:34] saint john 14 12 verily verily i say
[1:43:37] unto you
[1:43:37] he that believeth on me the works that i
[1:43:41] do
[1:43:42] shall he do also does that sound like
[1:43:44] preeminence to you
[1:43:47] he that believeth on me the works that i
[1:43:49] do shall he do also
[1:43:51] and greater works than thee shall he do
[1:43:53] his kingdom is on the increase
[1:43:56] his government is on the increase amen
[1:43:58] greater than thee shall he do because i
[1:44:00] go to my father
[1:44:01] and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name
[1:44:05] that will i do that the father may be
[1:44:07] glorified in the son
[1:44:09] if ye shall ask anything in my name
[1:44:13] i will do it now just to give you an
[1:44:16] illustration of the power of his word
[1:44:19] they brought a woman to the lord jesus
[1:44:21] one day
[1:44:22] that they had taken in the in the act of
[1:44:25] adultery
[1:44:27] and those men took her and drug her
[1:44:31] up to the lord to attempt him to tempt
[1:44:34] the lord jesus
[1:44:35] to see what his response would be and
[1:44:38] and to speak of the law of moses
[1:44:40] and and and to see whether he would
[1:44:41] condemn her
[1:44:43] or what his reaction would be and you
[1:44:44] know it's something to me
[1:44:47] if you think about this as those men you
[1:44:49] know
[1:44:51] whatever had brought them to realize
[1:44:54] to catch her in that act of adultery
[1:44:56] adultery however that had occurred
[1:44:59] that took priority over every other
[1:45:02] responsibility
[1:45:03] over every other commitment over every
[1:45:05] other care they had
[1:45:07] for that day condemning her
[1:45:11] bringing her under condemnation was the
[1:45:14] number one priority
[1:45:16] that they faced so they drag her to the
[1:45:18] lord jesus to see what he'll say
[1:45:21] and he doesn't say anything at first he
[1:45:23] just kneels
[1:45:25] and begins writing in the sand
[1:45:28] and we don't know what he wrote but we
[1:45:31] do know
[1:45:32] that whatever he wrote it rearranged
[1:45:36] their priorities because all of a sudden
[1:45:40] they lost all interest
[1:45:43] in condemning her and something about
[1:45:47] his
[1:45:47] presence something about his person
[1:45:51] and something about whatever he was
[1:45:53] writing there in the sand
[1:45:55] all of a sudden made them uncomfortable
[1:45:58] and one by one they dropped their stones
[1:46:03] that they had intended to stone her and
[1:46:06] take her life with
[1:46:07] they dropped them and they left
[1:46:10] and as uncomfortable as his presence
[1:46:14] made them feel self-righteous people
[1:46:19] people who you know they
[1:46:22] as far as they were concerned everything
[1:46:24] was right with their lives but his
[1:46:26] presence made them uncomfortable
[1:46:29] but his presence never made her
[1:46:31] uncomfortable
[1:46:33] and she was the sinner she was the one
[1:46:36] that had been caught in the act
[1:46:39] oh my amen but as as his presence and
[1:46:42] and the things he wrote in the sand
[1:46:44] dismissed all of the accusers and all of
[1:46:47] the accusations
[1:46:49] then finally he he he stands up
[1:46:52] and he says woman where are thine
[1:46:55] accusers
[1:46:56] she said i have none lord oh my she was
[1:47:00] justified
[1:47:02] amen i have none lord isn't that a
[1:47:04] wonderful feeling
[1:47:05] when you know all the accusations and
[1:47:07] all the condemnation
[1:47:09] all the guilt and the shame and he said
[1:47:11] neither
[1:47:12] do i condemn thee and then he told her
[1:47:16] this
[1:47:17] go and sin no more
[1:47:21] now as a person
[1:47:25] if any one of these children this
[1:47:27] morning were to to walk out the doors of
[1:47:29] this tabernacle
[1:47:30] and begin running out into stone avenue
[1:47:33] you know i would call out or you would
[1:47:35] call out to the stop
[1:47:37] you know little boy little girl stop
[1:47:40] don't do that and you'd go and
[1:47:41] and grab them and take them and bring
[1:47:43] them back to safety
[1:47:44] and then you know you would talk to them
[1:47:46] and say look don't ever do that again
[1:47:49] don't run into the street like that you
[1:47:50] could be killed you could be injured
[1:47:53] uh you know that that there there's
[1:47:55] danger there
[1:47:58] but all you could hope to do as a person
[1:48:03] is is to appeal to something inside that
[1:48:07] child
[1:48:08] that from their fear or their respect
[1:48:12] for you
[1:48:13] they would have to value your words to
[1:48:17] the extent
[1:48:18] that any time they would ever be tempted
[1:48:20] to do that again
[1:48:22] they would remember what you told them
[1:48:24] and out of their own merit
[1:48:26] or their own appreciation for your
[1:48:28] desire
[1:48:30] it would change their desire
[1:48:33] but that's all we could hope for as a
[1:48:36] person
[1:48:38] but when jesus spoke his words
[1:48:42] weren't a commandment
[1:48:45] or weren't just a law or weren't they
[1:48:48] weren't
[1:48:48] spoken as human words hoping to appeal
[1:48:52] to some quality that was within her but
[1:48:55] his words
[1:48:56] were power when he said go
[1:48:59] and sin no more his words could give her
[1:49:03] the power
[1:49:04] to live a sinless life from that day
[1:49:08] forward
[1:49:09] because that's the power that his word
[1:49:12] has
[1:49:12] to the believer because there is a
[1:49:15] quality within you
[1:49:17] amen but it's not your own quality so
[1:49:19] much
[1:49:20] as it is representation that he placed
[1:49:23] there before the foundation of the world
[1:49:25] that when his word is spoken into your
[1:49:28] heart
[1:49:29] there's something there to grasp it and
[1:49:31] for that word to become
[1:49:32] power in your life amen to transform you
[1:49:36] into the reflection or into the image of
[1:49:39] his word
[1:49:39] amen so when he speaks amen and
[1:49:43] when his word strike the heart of faith
[1:49:45] or the heart of the believer amen
[1:49:47] its power to transform you and i
[1:49:50] from whatever we used to do and whatever
[1:49:52] we used to be
[1:49:53] and whatever the condition of our life
[1:49:55] was amen
[1:49:56] his word is taking the preeminence over
[1:49:59] all of that amen
[1:50:01] and becoming the dominant force you
[1:50:04] believe that this morning
[1:50:06] oh my and then in saint luke chapter 22
[1:50:12] the lord spoke to peter he said simon
[1:50:14] simon behold
[1:50:16] satan hath desired to have you
[1:50:21] that he may sift you as wheat
[1:50:24] do you ever feel like your life
[1:50:28] is a battlefield of desires
[1:50:33] and not only satan's desires
[1:50:37] and god's desires but you know the
[1:50:39] desires of other
[1:50:40] people in your life your your parents
[1:50:42] your your companion
[1:50:44] your co-workers your leaders
[1:50:50] all of these things it seems like i know
[1:50:52] in my life sometimes it just seems like
[1:50:55] all of these influences all of these
[1:50:57] pulls all of
[1:50:58] people have all of these desires and
[1:51:00] many of them are are well-meaning
[1:51:02] and well-intentioned and and they are
[1:51:05] even for your benefit perhaps
[1:51:07] but god's desires amen
[1:51:11] that's what we want to prevail and to
[1:51:14] have the preeminence this morning
[1:51:16] and he's telling peter here satan hath
[1:51:18] desired
[1:51:19] to have you that he may sift you
[1:51:23] as wheat but i have prayed for thee
[1:51:27] that thy faith fail not i love that
[1:51:31] because he knew peter's confession would
[1:51:33] fail
[1:51:34] he knew peter's testimony would fail he
[1:51:37] knew peter would deny him
[1:51:39] and deny all association with him but he
[1:51:41] knew there was a quality within peter
[1:51:44] that would not fail and that was his
[1:51:47] faith amen
[1:51:48] even when his testimony even when his
[1:51:50] confession all of those other things
[1:51:52] were disintegrating his faith would
[1:51:54] remain
[1:51:55] i have prayed for thee that thy faith
[1:51:57] fell not
[1:51:59] and he didn't say if you're converted he
[1:52:02] said and when
[1:52:03] you are converted strengthen the
[1:52:05] brethren
[1:52:06] amen and jesus didn't only pray for
[1:52:09] peter
[1:52:10] but he also prayed for all that would
[1:52:12] come to believe him
[1:52:13] through their witness amen he prayed for
[1:52:16] you this morning
[1:52:17] and he prayed for me this morning amen
[1:52:19] and he knows there's a quality there's a
[1:52:22] faith in your heart amen
[1:52:23] that cannot be defeated amen and is
[1:52:26] going to prevail and is going to
[1:52:28] overcome
[1:52:28] despite all the pressures of laodicea
[1:52:31] despite all the persecution
[1:52:33] all the reproach you may face or bear
[1:52:36] everything your past amen
[1:52:38] his desires are going to prevail this
[1:52:40] morning
[1:52:42] amen he has that confidence god's got
[1:52:44] the same confidence in you
[1:52:46] that he had in peter you know i'm sure
[1:52:48] that peter didn't have any confidence in
[1:52:50] himself
[1:52:51] after all he had done it he was so
[1:52:53] determined
[1:52:55] he said lord i won't deny you i won't
[1:52:58] i won't deny i'll i'll stay right there
[1:53:00] with you but jesus told him
[1:53:02] you will and then peter did and he
[1:53:05] and he was out there on that boat and
[1:53:08] all of a sudden
[1:53:09] amen he heard that voice calling bread
[1:53:13] and fish upon the fire
[1:53:14] come and dying and he recognized jesus
[1:53:18] still has interest in me
[1:53:22] he still wants my fellowship he still
[1:53:24] wants my companionship
[1:53:26] he still wants my company and as soon as
[1:53:28] he was resurrected
[1:53:29] the angel told go tell his disciples and
[1:53:32] peter
[1:53:34] amen oh my doesn't matter what peter
[1:53:37] said
[1:53:38] doesn't matter that he denied him he's
[1:53:40] already made he's already seen an
[1:53:42] investment he's seen equality in peter
[1:53:45] and he's appealing to that quality
[1:53:47] amen he's inviting peter back oh my
[1:53:50] you know what peter needed peter needed
[1:53:52] pentecost
[1:53:55] peter needed the baptism of the holy
[1:53:56] ghost you know what that's what we need
[1:53:58] this morning
[1:54:01] it's it's wonderful to have the word of
[1:54:02] god it's wonderful to know the
[1:54:04] scriptures it's wonderful to know the
[1:54:06] message
[1:54:06] but if you don't have the dynamics to
[1:54:09] strike that mechanics
[1:54:11] your you can only go so far in good
[1:54:14] works
[1:54:14] you can only go so far in trying to live
[1:54:16] a christian life but when the holy
[1:54:18] spirit comes in
[1:54:19] amen it fills you with god's power and
[1:54:22] god's spirit and quickens that word in
[1:54:24] your life amen then it's not your
[1:54:25] goodness
[1:54:26] it's not your life it's not your works
[1:54:28] it's his power
[1:54:29] expressing itself through you amen he
[1:54:32] knew that peter and he said terry
[1:54:34] in jerusalem until you be endued with
[1:54:36] power from on high
[1:54:38] amen they had power to heal they had
[1:54:40] power to cast out devils
[1:54:41] they had power to perform miracles but
[1:54:43] he was going to give them
[1:54:45] power to live even power for his life
[1:54:48] to live through their lives and think
[1:54:51] about this
[1:54:52] on that day of pentecost when the world
[1:54:55] was watching as 120 came staggering out
[1:54:58] of the upper room
[1:54:59] think about what the world was thinking
[1:55:01] at that time
[1:55:04] these are men that can't do
[1:55:07] anything without jesus
[1:55:12] they were fishermen before they met
[1:55:14] jesus
[1:55:16] but after they met him they couldn't
[1:55:19] even catch
[1:55:19] fish without his instruction
[1:55:24] because they fished all night long
[1:55:28] and couldn't catch a single fish until
[1:55:30] he spoke to him and said
[1:55:32] cast your net on the other side
[1:55:36] anything they were before they met him
[1:55:38] became
[1:55:39] nothing when they met him and then when
[1:55:42] they met him
[1:55:43] they were nothing without him
[1:55:46] he gave him power to heal the sick and
[1:55:48] to cast out devils
[1:55:49] and then they came upon a
[1:55:51] demon-possessed person one day that
[1:55:53] even they couldn't heal until he came
[1:55:56] and healed them they were they were
[1:55:59] they were boatmen they were sailors
[1:56:02] before they met
[1:56:03] jesus but after they met him they
[1:56:06] couldn't sell from one side of the lake
[1:56:08] to the other
[1:56:09] except they had to wake him up they
[1:56:13] aren't anything
[1:56:14] without jesus and now he's been gone for
[1:56:17] 10 days
[1:56:19] and here they come out of the upper room
[1:56:22] we're going to see
[1:56:23] what these men are now and can i just
[1:56:26] say this morning
[1:56:27] he's back amen
[1:56:30] he told him it's expedient for you that
[1:56:32] i go away
[1:56:34] but he wasn't going away any longer amen
[1:56:36] he had returned in the form of the holy
[1:56:39] spirit
[1:56:40] and now he was living within them amen
[1:56:43] the same man who only days
[1:56:45] before had denied him when the pressure
[1:56:47] was applied
[1:56:48] when they said you're one of those
[1:56:50] you're one of his associates
[1:56:51] you're one of those disciples now they
[1:56:53] look at peter and say what meaneth this
[1:56:56] and that same man who denied him only
[1:56:58] days before
[1:56:59] said men and brethren these men aren't
[1:57:01] drunk as you suppose
[1:57:03] but this is that that was spoken by the
[1:57:05] prophet joel
[1:57:06] amen he began to take amen instead of
[1:57:09] being ashamed of his behavior
[1:57:10] instead of being ashamed of his conduct
[1:57:13] he took what was taking place
[1:57:15] right back to the scripture he said what
[1:57:17] you're seeing here
[1:57:18] what you're seeing in my life is what
[1:57:20] the prophet joel said it's not a
[1:57:22] prophecy any longer it's a reality
[1:57:24] glory to god even it's not words on the
[1:57:27] page any longer
[1:57:28] it's a reality in my life it's not just
[1:57:31] the words of the bible anymore it's
[1:57:33] living in me
[1:57:35] oh my repent and be baptized in the name
[1:57:38] of jesus christ
[1:57:40] for the remission of your sins and you
[1:57:41] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:57:44] amen now there was something speaking
[1:57:46] from peter
[1:57:48] that he didn't he didn't apologize for
[1:57:50] he didn't back up on
[1:57:52] amen he was willing to bear the reproach
[1:57:55] and look the same
[1:57:56] power that accompanied the words of
[1:57:58] jesus
[1:57:59] we're now accompanying the words of
[1:58:01] peter when they went to the layman at
[1:58:03] the gate called beautiful
[1:58:04] he said silver and gold have i none but
[1:58:07] such as i have give i unto thee
[1:58:09] in the name of jesus christ of nazareth
[1:58:11] rise up and walk
[1:58:13] and the power of that word struck that
[1:58:15] man and he leaped to his feet and began
[1:58:17] dancing and rejoicing and praising god
[1:58:20] amen
[1:58:21] oh my can i say this morning he's back
[1:58:25] amen he's living in his church he's
[1:58:27] living in his people he's sent his word
[1:58:29] in this hour
[1:58:30] and it's been received into a body of
[1:58:32] believers into a heart of people and
[1:58:34] he's working he's moving
[1:58:35] he's living he's loving he's forgiving
[1:58:38] he's healing and he's saving amen
[1:58:40] through a body of redeemed men and women
[1:58:42] sons and daughters of god
[1:58:45] amen the only way you are saved
[1:58:49] is to know him by revelation if i can
[1:58:52] take
[1:58:53] i could take the presbyterian doctrine
[1:58:55] and tie you pentecostals till you won't
[1:58:57] know
[1:58:58] i can take the baptist doctrine and show
[1:59:00] you pentecostals
[1:59:02] a million things that you know nothing
[1:59:04] of that's right
[1:59:05] but that's not it that's not his church
[1:59:08] that's not his church his church
[1:59:12] is himself revealed
[1:59:16] think about that his church
[1:59:19] is himself revealed
[1:59:23] amen do you see it and expressed
[1:59:26] by the word itself that he is god
[1:59:30] amen i'm coming to a close this morning
[1:59:32] but the prophet of god also says
[1:59:34] the life in the body is a vindication
[1:59:39] of the rapture is at hand you see this
[1:59:42] preeminence
[1:59:43] is going to increase
[1:59:46] until the extent amen that it will one
[1:59:49] day
[1:59:50] change our bodies without having to go
[1:59:53] through the process of death you know
[1:59:57] i believe it i i don't have the quote
[1:59:58] but brother branham makes reference to
[2:00:00] when jesus turned the water into wine
[2:00:04] brother bam said that water would have
[2:00:05] eventually become wine
[2:00:08] would have had to come up and be drawn
[2:00:10] up by a grapevine
[2:00:12] and then manifest itself in a grape and
[2:00:14] then be squeezed and
[2:00:15] and and fermented all those things and
[2:00:17] to become wine and he said jesus just
[2:00:19] bypassed the process
[2:00:22] and he turned the water into wine amen
[2:00:25] and
[2:00:25] we should have to go through the process
[2:00:28] of death
[2:00:29] but he's going to bypass that process
[2:00:31] and
[2:00:32] change these vile bodies into the
[2:00:34] glorious image
[2:00:36] of his own body amen and a glorified
[2:00:38] condition will be changed in a moment
[2:00:40] in the twinkling of an eye amen why it's
[2:00:44] him having the preeminence oh
[2:00:47] my it's his word calling for a bride
[2:00:51] and bringing that bride into the perfect
[2:00:54] image
[2:00:55] of who he is amen he says
[2:00:58] god become from god to become me
[2:01:02] to take my sin upon him that
[2:01:05] he might make me him
[2:01:10] who's doing it he is
[2:01:13] he's the one doing it you're the object
[2:01:16] of it
[2:01:16] you're the result of it amen you're the
[2:01:19] product of it
[2:01:20] but it's him doing it so it's not even
[2:01:22] you amen it's
[2:01:23] you don't you're not taking the credit
[2:01:25] or the responsibility for it
[2:01:26] but he's doing it he might make me him
[2:01:29] amen
[2:01:30] back to his great purpose of sons
[2:01:34] and daughters of god
[2:01:37] amen i want to just
[2:01:40] take a moment as perhaps the musicians
[2:01:42] would come
[2:01:46] and just refer or take your mind back to
[2:01:50] when john was there in revelation
[2:01:53] chapter 5
[2:01:55] and he began to weep because no man was
[2:01:58] found worthy
[2:02:01] and he realized all was lost if no one
[2:02:04] was worthy to come
[2:02:05] and take the book but then
[2:02:09] one of the elders said weep not john
[2:02:11] behold
[2:02:12] the lion of the tribe of judah hath
[2:02:15] prevailed
[2:02:16] to take the book and to loose the seals
[2:02:19] thereof
[2:02:19] and john said i turned he turned to see
[2:02:23] a lion
[2:02:25] but what he saw was a lamb
[2:02:28] a lion you know he's the king of the
[2:02:31] jungle
[2:02:32] he's a terrible creature every every
[2:02:34] other creature in the jungle
[2:02:35] even larger animals fear the roar of
[2:02:38] that lion
[2:02:40] but when john turned amen
[2:02:43] he didn't see a lion he saw a lamb
[2:02:48] and the lamb and the attributes of a
[2:02:50] lamb
[2:02:51] as a sacrifice and as an atonement
[2:02:54] and as a substitute those attributes
[2:02:58] became the preeminent qualities
[2:03:01] that became apparent to john when he
[2:03:04] looked
[2:03:06] because he was what that lamb died for
[2:03:09] and he was what that lamb bled for
[2:03:12] he was the reason that that lamb came
[2:03:15] and
[2:03:16] think about this brother and sister john
[2:03:18] was present
[2:03:20] in the life and ministry of jesus christ
[2:03:23] he was he was there at calvary he was
[2:03:26] one of the last remaining disciples
[2:03:29] that stayed at the foot of the cross as
[2:03:32] jesus bled
[2:03:34] as his lamb for this for his sins
[2:03:38] he witnessed the resurrection he
[2:03:40] witnessed the ascension
[2:03:41] but he never truly realized
[2:03:44] what it meant to him personally until
[2:03:47] he's carried over on the allopatmus
[2:03:49] and in revelations chapter 5 he sees
[2:03:52] that lamb come forth
[2:03:54] and prevail the lion of the tribe of
[2:03:58] judah had prevailed to take the book
[2:04:00] and to loose the seals thereof do you
[2:04:02] know
[2:04:03] that the same worthiness that was
[2:04:06] required
[2:04:07] to loose the seals was also required
[2:04:10] to look upon that book
[2:04:14] no man was found worthy to loose the
[2:04:16] seals nor to look thereon
[2:04:18] each required the same level of
