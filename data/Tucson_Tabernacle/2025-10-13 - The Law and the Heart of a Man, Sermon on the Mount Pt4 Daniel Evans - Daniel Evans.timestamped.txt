[16:39] here from our sister Rebecca Zubbran.
[16:41] Praising the Lord. My dad, John Brunan,
[16:43] is home recovering. You may recall
[16:45] several weeks ago he uh fell off a
[16:48] ladder and severely broke his leg in a
[16:50] few places. And he's home now, still in
[16:52] therapy, still still recovering, but uh
[16:55] praising the Lord. He still has a bit to
[16:57] cover, says the note.
[16:59] And also reminds me that our uh sister
[17:02] Susan Lipicard in Switzerland that had
[17:04] that uh cancer operation and she's still
[17:07] at home recovering. We don't want to
[17:09] just because a request has been brought
[17:10] up every week doesn't mean that we
[17:12] should forget about those that have been
[17:14] brought.
[17:16] Got a very serious request this morning
[17:18] from our sister Erica Morales.
[17:22] Please really put this one in your
[17:24] heart. Please pray for me and my
[17:26] daughter Gia. Monday we are filing
[17:29] emergency papers for sole custody of
[17:31] her. Her home life with her father is no
[17:34] longer livable. So please, she's with me
[17:37] now.
[17:39] Nothing is more precious in our lives
[17:42] than our children. And to see them
[17:44] raised in an atmosphere of love and
[17:46] respect, being raised to serve the Lord,
[17:49] to honor him, to realize our
[17:52] relationship with each other.
[17:55] That this one really touched my heart.
[17:56] If we can just go to the Lord in prayer.
[17:58] If you have anything on your heart,
[18:00] anything at all, especially especially
[18:03] if it's for someone else, then please
[18:06] let's go to the Lord. Lord Jesus,
[18:10] we're in awe of you. Nothing nothing
[18:13] compares as we just sang. Mountains will
[18:17] bow down, Lord. Nothing can stand before
[18:19] the power of your name, Lord, with your
[18:21] spirit behind it and in your will. Lord,
[18:24] we pray for healing, Lord, for those
[18:26] that have asked for it, Lord, and for
[18:29] Lord, all those that are suffering,
[18:30] Lord. I I I I think of uh of my niece up
[18:34] in Presca going undergoing all the the
[18:36] cancer therapy and everything right now,
[18:40] Lord, but especially for this prayer for
[18:41] our sister Erica, Lord, and this home
[18:43] life, Lord, for her daughter that she
[18:45] could just be brought into the into that
[18:48] home, Lord, where where you are
[18:50] recognized, Lord, and where there's that
[18:52] love, Lord, that respect and there's no
[18:55] uh abuse or whatever the issues are that
[18:57] are going on that we don't know the
[18:58] details, but you know every detail.
[19:01] We thank you for this service this
[19:02] morning. I thank you that so many are
[19:04] here to worship you, to acknowledge you,
[19:06] to be together, Lord, in unity and
[19:08] faith, Lord, and just the love that
[19:10] you've placed in our hearts for one
[19:12] another. Bring us together now, Lord.
[19:14] And as our pastor comes to bring the
[19:16] word this morning and and another song
[19:18] or two of worship, Lord, and praise,
[19:20] Lord, and just recognizing our place,
[19:23] Lord, with respect to you, how we love
[19:25] you, Lord. How we Lord, we're just so
[19:28] grateful. We just want to say thank you
[19:30] and thank you again. And Lord, for the
[19:32] offerings and the gifts that are coming,
[19:33] Lord, we just pray that they'd be used
[19:35] in accordance with your will and for
[19:37] your purposes to further the kingdom, to
[19:39] bring others in, Lord, to a saving
[19:41] knowledge of Jesus Christ. We thank you
[19:44] and we worship you in Jesus precious
[19:46] name. Amen.
[19:50] &gt;&gt; You can all have your seats.
[19:53] [Music]
[20:07] We could get some more guitar right here
[20:09] on this.
[20:12] this one.
[20:20] [Music]
[20:26] &gt;&gt; I'm praying for
[20:30] everything's going to be all right.
[20:33] Lord, I see another battle. It's out in
[20:37] front of me.
[20:39] I'm afraid I won't be able and I'll go
[20:43] down in defeat.
[20:46] He said, "Do you remember
[20:50] where I brought you from? Just take a
[20:54] look behind you at how far you've come."
[20:59] And every time you ask me, "Didn't I
[21:04] deliver you?"
[21:06] So why would you be thinking that I
[21:10] wouldn't see you through?
[21:13] &gt;&gt; Didn't I walk on the water?
[21:18] &gt;&gt; I calmed the raging sea.
[21:22] &gt;&gt; I spoke to the wind
[21:26] and hushed and I gave you peace. Didn't
[21:30] I run to your resue? And I hear you when
[21:35] you call.
[21:38] &gt;&gt; I walked right beside you just so you
[21:43] wouldn't fall.
[21:45] &gt;&gt; Then I leave all of heaven
[21:49] just to die for your sins.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; I searched until I found you.
[21:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, I do it all again.
[22:02] Well, she's talking to her father.
[22:06] She's hurt and so confused.
[22:10] She has no one she can turn to. Just God
[22:16] alone.
[22:18] She hears a voice so still and low. Says
[22:21] a move like that before.
[22:25] I'll do this little thing for you. I'll
[22:30] give you so much more. Didn't I walk on
[22:35] the water? Didn't I calm the raging sea?
[22:41] &gt;&gt; I spoke to the wind.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; It hushed and I gave you peace. Then I
[22:49] run to your resue. Then I hear you when
[22:54] you called.
[22:57] I walked right beside you just so you
[23:02] wouldn't fall. Did I leave all of heaven
[23:08] just to die for your sin?
[23:12] &gt;&gt; I searched until I found you. Oh, I do
[23:16] it all again.
[23:19] Did I leave all of heaven
[23:23] just to die for your sin?
[23:27] &gt;&gt; I searched until I found you.
[23:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, I do it all again.
[23:38] [Applause]
[23:55] This song has been on my heart for a
[23:57] little while. Uh, keep putting off
[23:59] singing it, but uh, finally decided to
[24:02] sing it. But, uh,
[24:05] name of the c the song is the cross.
[24:07] And, uh, there's a couple lines in the
[24:10] second verse that really speak to me.
[24:13] Um,
[24:17] who told you grace can't reach the
[24:18] messed up ones like you?
[24:21] Has the devil made you believe the lies
[24:23] he tells are true? When you're sure that
[24:26] you're the one who's wandered too far
[24:28] off, it's not too late. Just come home
[24:30] to the cross. So,
[24:34] um, actually the one I wanted was
[24:37] actually verse two. Everybody's got a
[24:39] list at least a mile long of every scar
[24:42] and every sin from everywhere where
[24:44] we've done wrong.
[24:47] I know we see our own faults
[24:50] and we build a list and other people
[24:52] build a list against us, but Christ
[24:55] doesn't see that list.
[24:57] The the next lines are but there's
[24:59] reason for rejoicing. The reason is
[25:02] because that list was nailed to the
[25:04] cross.
[25:06] So if you know it, sing it with me.
[25:10] [Music]
[25:19] [Music]
[25:21] You've been trying hard to bear
[25:25] the weight of all your shame. And if
[25:29] there's a God up there, you're sure he
[25:33] forgot your name.
[25:35] When your steps are getting heavy
[25:39] and hope looks all but lost,
[25:43] just bring it all to the cross.
[25:50] Who told you grace can't reach
[25:54] messed up ones like you? Has the devil
[25:58] made you believe
[26:01] the lies he tells are true? When you're
[26:04] sure that you're the one who's wonder
[26:08] too far off, it's not too late. Just
[26:13] come home to the cross.
[26:17] Come and see your savior's love that
[26:21] would die to make you new. Nothing you
[26:25] have ever done can change what mercy's
[26:28] done for you. And if you ever wonder if
[26:34] you're worth so great a cause,
[26:37] look up and see the cross.
[26:43] Everybody's got a list
[26:47] at least a mile long. every scar and
[26:51] every sin from everywhere we've done
[26:55] wrong. But there's reason for rejoicing.
[27:00] And the reason is because
[27:03] that list was nailed to the cross.
[27:09] Come and see a Savior's love that would
[27:13] die to make you new. Nothing you have
[27:17] ever done can change what mercy's done
[27:21] for you. And if you ever wonder if your
[27:26] word so great a cost, look up and see
[27:32] the cross.
[27:35] He was wounded for your wounds.
[27:39] Pierced for all your sins. By his
[27:42] stripes you are healed. He died so you
[27:46] could rise again. He let the blood and
[27:50] water flow. Did it all. Let you know
[27:55] you're the reason that he went to the
[27:59] cross.
[28:01] Oh, he's calling you to run home to the
[28:05] cross.
[28:08] Come and see Savior's love that would
[28:12] die to make you new. Nothing you have
[28:16] ever done can change what mercy's done
[28:19] for you. And if you ever wonder if
[28:24] you're worth so great a cause, look up
[28:29] and see the cross.
[28:34] Look up and see the cross.
[28:40] Look up and see the cross.
[28:49] [Applause]
[28:58] Thank you, brother Michael. Would you
[29:01] all stand with me as brother Daniel gets
[29:03] ready to come?
[29:05] We're going to sing, "What a friend we
[29:06] have in Jesus."
[29:12] There's a line in here that says, uh,
[29:16] "Oh, what peace we often forfeit.
[29:19] Oh, what needless pain we bear all
[29:22] because we do not carry everything to
[29:24] God in prayer."
[29:27] It says, "Needless pain we bear.
[29:31] which sometimes offends people because
[29:34] they say, "My pain is real.
[29:37] What needless pain we bear just because
[29:41] all we have to do is give it to the
[29:42] Lord." The man who wrote this song
[29:46] was from Ireland. He moved to Canada,
[29:48] got engaged, and his fiance died the
[29:52] night before their wedding.
[29:56] So, he moved back out east.
[29:59] uh in eastern Canada and several years
[30:02] later got engaged again
[30:06] and again his wife to be died
[30:09] twice. He had that happen to him
[30:15] and he wrote in a tear stained letter
[30:18] these words to his mother.
[30:21] What a friend we have in Jesus.
[30:24] I would say that this this man had some
[30:27] pain that he bore in his life and he
[30:31] said we bear it and we hold on to it and
[30:33] we carry it with us only because we
[30:36] don't just give it to the Lord if we
[30:39] just give it to the Lord in prayer.
[30:43] Let's sing this verse. His name was
[30:46] Joseph Scriven. And I think this song is
[30:49] more alive than it was when he first
[30:50] wrote it.
[30:54] What
[30:56] a friend we have in Jesus.
[31:03] [Music]
[31:05] All
[31:07] our sins and griefs to bear.
[31:14] Oh, what
[31:17] a privilege
[31:20] to care.
[31:23] Read
[31:26] everything
[31:29] to God in prayer. Oh, what peace.
[31:36] Oh,
[31:38] what peace we often forfeit.
[31:43] [Music]
[31:46] Oh,
[31:48] what needless pain we bear.
[31:53] [Music]
[31:56] All
[31:58] because we do not care.
[32:06] everything
[32:09] to God in prayer. As brother Daniel
[32:13] comes, let's just sing that again. Let's
[32:15] raise our hands to the Lord. What
[32:19] a friend we have in Jesus.
[32:25] [Music]
[32:27] all
[32:29] our sins and griefs to bear.
[32:37] What
[32:39] a privilege
[32:42] to carry
[32:50] everything to God in prayer.
[32:57] Amen.
[32:58] [Music]
[33:01] &gt;&gt; What an understatement about what a
[33:03] friend that we have in Jesus.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; He is truly a friend. He's been a friend
[33:08] to me my whole life. He's been a friend
[33:10] to you.
[33:12] What a friend that we can take whatever
[33:15] we have and just lay it before him in
[33:18] prayer. Let's pray.
[33:21] Lord God, thank you.
[33:23] Thank you for the spirit that's here
[33:25] this morning. Thank you for the
[33:27] congregation.
[33:29] Thank you for a place that we have to
[33:31] worship.
[33:33] Lord, thank you that you have been such
[33:36] a friend to us.
[33:39] Lord, there's
[33:42] there's not a friend in the world that
[33:44] we can count on except for you. That you
[33:47] will be there no matter what, Father.
[33:50] that you are with us and you told us,
[33:53] you made a promise that you will never
[33:55] leave us nor forsake us. Lord, we hold
[33:58] to that promise.
[34:00] We love you in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[34:05] You can be seated.
[34:10] I think brother Ly said he feels good. I
[34:12] feel good, too.
[34:14] It's a beautiful, beautiful day. Welcome
[34:16] to visitors. I uh saw Brother Timman and
[34:20] Sister Peggy in the back. Welcome, Mr.
[34:22] Naomi Walters's brother and her
[34:24] sister-in-law. God bless you. It's good
[34:26] to have you.
[34:28] [Applause]
[34:32] And then I met a young man, uh I believe
[34:34] Josiah invited him to church. Ashton,
[34:36] where you at? Oh, you're way in the
[34:38] back. Welcome, Ashton. Good to see you.
[34:41] God bless you.
[34:45] Oh, Brother Joe, Sister Carrie
[34:47] Hogensson, I uh it's so good to see you
[34:51] again. I saw you on Wednesday and I just
[34:53] feel a kindred spirit with both of you.
[34:55] It's it's good to have you in service.
[34:57] They're longtime friends, I think, to
[34:59] many people here, especially Brother Ly,
[35:01] Sister Heather. It's good to have you in
[35:03] service. Welcome.
[35:05] [Applause]
[35:09] And I I don't know if I missed anybody.
[35:12] Boy, we got Tony and Stephanie brought
[35:16] the whole clan today. We got we got uh
[35:19] we got seven and we got Maddox and then
[35:23] we have Matt and then we have Mary, Mama
[35:26] Mary. We have the mother of Tony and uh
[35:30] then we have uh Micah, right? Where's M?
[35:34] Micah. Micah here. Good to have you.
[35:36] Good to have the whole family. And then
[35:37] of course,
[35:39] brother Mitchell, the father of them
[35:41] all. The father of them all. God, God
[35:43] bless you. And if I missed you, sister,
[35:45] welcome. If I missed any of the
[35:47] visitors, God bless you. It's It's good
[35:49] to have you in service. We um I've been
[35:54] I know we're not supposed to be proud,
[35:56] but I've been proud of the congregation
[35:58] lately. I've been getting some just some
[36:02] contacts as people have been asking
[36:05] about what do I need to do? What what do
[36:08] I need to do to to be better? What do I
[36:11] need to stop doing or what do I need to
[36:13] start doing? And it's been it's been
[36:15] just a real blessing to see what's on
[36:17] the people's heart. They want to take
[36:18] the next step. Even Heath before
[36:20] service, he came into my office and he's
[36:22] like he's like, "Brother, the Lord's
[36:23] delivered me from all of these things."
[36:25] He says, "I'm I'm not dependent on
[36:27] anything anymore." He says, "No, no."
[36:29] Almost like, "What do I need to stop
[36:31] doing now?" And it's like, "No, man. He
[36:34] The Lord works on the heart.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; That's the most important thing. Just
[36:39] sit back and just let him work on you.
[36:43] Let him deal with with your heart." And
[36:46] friends, we look at our sins too much.
[36:49] We've been we sang these songs of
[36:51] worship this morning. Listen to the
[36:53] words in these songs. These songs are
[36:56] talking about how Jesus died for our
[36:58] sins, how he took our sins away and stop
[37:02] looking at your sins
[37:04] because you're going to find them. All
[37:06] of us, brother James, I didn't recognize
[37:08] you. Welcome. Good. Good to have you in
[37:09] service, too. I didn't
[37:12] look at these things. Don't look at the
[37:14] things that you do wrong. Look at
[37:17] Christ.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; Always focus on him. Focus on the Lord.
[37:22] And then you'll find that these sins
[37:24] that you do, these things that bother
[37:26] you, it's like, why do I keep doing this
[37:28] or that, they just kind of fall away if
[37:31] you're focusing on Jesus.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; That's that's the right way to be. And
[37:36] don't be like, and we're going to talk
[37:38] about legalism this morning because
[37:39] that's next in line with the sermon on
[37:41] the mount. Don't be the legalist always
[37:44] looking at the sin.
[37:47] look at Christ and then you watch how
[37:49] Christ will come into the heart and
[37:51] he'll make everything better. So, we've
[37:54] been going through this sermon on the
[37:55] mount.
[37:57] I I say it every Sunday and we've been
[37:59] going through this. This is a
[38:01] masterpiece of a sermon. And I got to
[38:05] tell you, it just keeps getting better
[38:06] and better as I'm reading through it and
[38:09] praying on it and looking what Jesus
[38:11] said. I was telling my wife the other
[38:13] day, I said, "Honey, no one has ever
[38:15] spoken like this man." No one has ever
[38:18] said things like Jesus said from the
[38:21] beginning of time until now.
[38:24] Jesus's words are they're incredible.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; The wisdom that he spoke and how he just
[38:32] lined things out. We started we started
[38:37] this series on on the temptation of
[38:39] Jesus, how he went into the wilderness.
[38:40] He had to experience what we go through.
[38:44] Don't don't forget Jesus was tempted in
[38:47] every way that we are tempted. The Bible
[38:49] says that he but he overcame it and he
[38:52] show he showed us that we are able to
[38:54] overcome. And then we get into we get
[38:58] into Matthew chapter 5 and how we went
[39:01] through the biatitudes and and how that
[39:04] we became a Christian and how we become
[39:06] the salt of the earth and and the light
[39:08] of the world. And then then last week we
[39:12] talked about Jesus coming not to do away
[39:15] with the Old Testament. He didn't. Let's
[39:18] go to Matthew chapter 5. We'll get right
[39:20] into it. Verse 17.
[39:22] We'll review a little bit from last
[39:24] week. Matthew 5:17 says this. Think not
[39:28] that I am come to destroy the law or the
[39:30] prophets. I am not come to destroy but
[39:33] to fulfill. So Jesus is talking about
[39:35] the law that Moses wrote and the rest of
[39:38] the the Old Testament and the rest of
[39:40] the Bible at that time. So he's
[39:42] basically saying it's all true.
[39:45] For verily I say unto you, till heaven
[39:48] and earth pass, not one jot or one tit
[39:51] shall in no wise pass from the law till
[39:53] all be fulfilled.
[39:55] Whosoever therefore shall break one of
[39:57] the least of these commandments and
[39:59] shall teach men so, he shall be called
[40:02] the least in the kingdom of heaven. But
[40:04] whosoever shall do and teach them, the
[40:07] same shall be called great in the
[40:10] kingdom of heaven. So he's talking about
[40:13] this law. So last week we talked about
[40:16] the sacrificial and the ceremonial
[40:18] commandments that were fulfilled in
[40:22] Christ and you don't need to observe
[40:25] those anymore. It's okay if like brother
[40:28] Ly will often say that that this is Yam
[40:32] Kapour or this is Feast of Tabernacles.
[40:34] It's okay to honor those. It's okay to
[40:37] remember what happened on those like on
[40:39] the Passover with with Moses and the
[40:42] death angel coming through. It's okay to
[40:44] do that. But those things are not
[40:47] required anymore.
[40:49] There's the the sacrificial lamb. You
[40:52] don't have to make a sacrifice for your
[40:54] sins anymore. that was fulfilled in
[40:56] Jesus Christ. The ceremonial washing
[40:59] that they did. Jesus and his disciples,
[41:04] they were out, they were out eating one
[41:06] time and they offended the priests
[41:08] because they didn't wash in the way that
[41:11] was the um the way that they were
[41:14] taught. baptism really into Christ, the
[41:18] washing away of the sins that fulfilled
[41:22] that symbolic gesture of the Old
[41:24] Testament baptisms, the Old Testament
[41:26] washings. And then there was the society
[41:29] laws that pertain to that time. So the
[41:32] Hebrews, they went through the
[41:34] wilderness and they were about to go
[41:37] over this Jordan River and into this new
[41:39] land. Well, in that new land were
[41:43] heathens, were idolattors. In this
[41:46] strange land, it was witchcraft and idol
[41:48] worship. And God gave them laws for that
[41:52] time that they wouldn't get caught up in
[41:55] what the Canaanites were doing. The
[41:56] Canaanites were the residents of the
[41:58] land beyond Jordan. He didn't want them
[42:01] to get caught up in the witchcraft and
[42:03] caught up in all the idolatry that they
[42:05] were doing. So, he made those laws. But
[42:07] we can take those laws, as we said last
[42:10] week, and we can apply them to today. It
[42:14] doesn't necessarily uh have to be how
[42:16] you cut your hair, like I talked last
[42:18] last week, but you can apply certain
[42:22] things in certain ways in your lives.
[42:24] And then there are the moral laws like
[42:27] the Ten Commandments, the laws about how
[42:30] to treat each other, what not to do.
[42:32] Those laws are still in effect.
[42:36] But Jesus is going to take those laws
[42:39] here and he's going to take them to the
[42:42] next level on this next section of the
[42:46] sermon on the mount. G Jesus and really
[42:49] to understand this whole sermon to
[42:51] understand what Jesus is doing and to
[42:54] understand Jesus's whole ministry you
[42:56] have to understand that that Jesus came
[42:59] not to to preach necessarily something
[43:03] that wasn't in line with the Old
[43:05] Testament. But he came to take the
[43:09] legalism that was in the Old Testament
[43:11] and to really bring it to life. Jesus's
[43:15] ministry,
[43:17] unlike the Old Testament, Jesus's
[43:20] ministry worked on the inner man. It
[43:24] worked on the heart.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; It cleansed God's people from the inside
[43:29] out.
[43:31] So, there are certain rules that like a
[43:35] legalistic church would teach. The
[43:38] preacher would preach and and he would
[43:41] he would they say these things, but
[43:45] it actually when you have a legalistic
[43:48] way of thinking, it actually brings more
[43:52] sin in to your life. When you have a set
[43:56] of rules that you follow, a set of
[43:58] whether it be um what you eat, whether
[44:00] it be your dress or how you worship or
[44:03] whatever that might be, it actually if
[44:05] you follow a set of rules, it actually
[44:08] allows for sin to come in. Here's what
[44:11] the Old Testament was. If there's a
[44:13] cliff right here
[44:16] that means sin, the Old Testament would
[44:19] allow you to walk right up to that
[44:23] cliff. walk right up to murder
[44:27] right there
[44:29] and not sin. It would allow you to walk
[44:33] right up to the edge of adultery
[44:38] and not sin. Like David looking at Ba
[44:42] Sheba, lusting after Ba Sheeba, he
[44:46] didn't sin until he had sex with her.
[44:49] But there was something that led all the
[44:51] way up to that point. Hatred.
[44:54] Hatred is you you you hate someone and
[44:57] it fers and it fers and you go right up
[45:00] to that point and if you can keep
[45:04] yourself from murdering,
[45:07] you don't sin. Some people,
[45:11] they did it and they do it. But Jesus is
[45:14] is saying, "No, this this isn't the
[45:16] line. Jesus is working on the heart all
[45:19] the way back so you don't even get close
[45:21] to that line.
[45:23] And that's the Old Testament
[45:25] versus the New Testament. The New
[45:27] Testament, even though it does away with
[45:30] the rules, it becomes more moral. And
[45:34] we're going to see that here.
[45:36] So, the Old Testament really, it was
[45:39] built on legalism. But I want you to
[45:41] notice something in the Old Testament.
[45:44] For you Bible readers, you read from
[45:45] Genesis to Revelation.
[45:48] How many converts do you see in the Old
[45:51] Testament?
[45:54] Really none. There's a couple that came
[45:56] in by marriage. Maybe there's a like
[46:00] Rahab you see there and and uh you have
[46:03] Ruth that came in, but the Old Testament
[46:06] in its legalistic ways does away or does
[46:11] doesn't allow for evangelism. Doesn't
[46:13] allow to bring people into the church.
[46:18] Then Jesus comes and all of a sudden it
[46:21] is all about winning souls, all about
[46:25] bringing people in because it does away
[46:28] with the legalist way of thinking. I was
[46:31] talking with Stephanie on the way to um
[46:33] church this morning and we were talking
[46:35] about how it's all about winning souls
[46:38] and winning souls if we can just get
[46:40] that one soul to the Lord. But we have
[46:44] to be careful. What about the souls that
[46:47] are lost
[46:50] because of our legalistic ways? What
[46:53] about those? What about the ones that
[46:55] are that come in and are offended
[46:58] because of the way that we act or or
[47:00] because we try to put them in a box?
[47:02] What about those? What is that soul?
[47:04] Does that soul not matter?
[47:07] And that's what Jesus is coming for to
[47:10] do. He came and now when he starts
[47:14] ministering when that Holy Spirit starts
[47:16] to come no the morality doesn't go the
[47:19] morality actually the level of morality
[47:21] goes higher but now it opens the door
[47:25] for other people to come in
[47:29] and that is a Christian way versus the
[47:32] old testament legalistic ways nobody
[47:34] came in but it wasn't about that that
[47:37] wasn't the purpose but now when Jesus
[47:40] comes comes in now it's about everybody.
[47:41] The Old Testament was about this one
[47:43] lineage of people that really preserve
[47:46] the word and then we go to the New
[47:48] Testament and it becomes about everyone.
[47:52] Everyone who has a soul the New
[47:56] Testament was written for really the
[47:57] whole Bible was written for.
[48:00] So really Jesus is going to go into this
[48:03] that is no longer going to be an outward
[48:06] expression of rules. The cleaning is
[48:09] going to come from the inside out. And
[48:13] for this part of the sermon on the
[48:14] mount, we can see the difference really
[48:17] is going to be between the outward
[48:19] Christian and the inward Christian. The
[48:21] outward murderer and the inward
[48:24] murderer. The outward adulterer and the
[48:26] inward adulterer. Now listen to this.
[48:28] Matthew chapter 5 verse 20
[48:35] says this. For I say unto you that
[48:39] except your righteousness shall shall
[48:42] exceed the the righteousness of the
[48:44] scribes and the Pharisees, you shall in
[48:47] no case enter into the kingdom of
[48:49] heaven.
[48:50] You have to understand who the scribes
[48:52] and the Pharisees were. These are the
[48:55] most holy of the holy. They are the most
[48:58] legal of the legalistic. The scribes and
[49:01] the Pharisees lived an outward life that
[49:04] was perfect. You could not put your
[49:07] finger on them or they wouldn't have
[49:08] been in the position that they were in.
[49:11] So no, but no matter how great they
[49:14] seemed to be, no matter how great these
[49:17] priests were, Jesus is saying your
[49:22] righteousness has to exceed their
[49:24] righteousness.
[49:26] How could that be? That's a rough one.
[49:30] That's a hard one because we are always
[49:32] looking on the outside. It's like
[49:35] saying, 'If you want to be part of our
[49:37] youth group for you guys, you got to
[49:39] bench press more than Daniel Jr.
[49:43] It's like, bro, I can't do that.
[49:46] Well, you have to. That's that's setting
[49:48] the bar. Or if or you have to be able to
[49:51] play the piano like Katie does or like
[49:53] Lily does. Well, I can't do that. That's
[49:56] impossible. That's what's if you look at
[49:59] this on the outward expression, it's
[50:00] like, well, I can't attain that. How can
[50:02] I have a righteousness as great as these
[50:05] others that ha that are so righteous?
[50:08] It's impossible.
[50:10] But that's the way most people think. So
[50:13] to be righteous,
[50:16] it may sound odd, but to be righteous,
[50:19] you need to first realize that you are
[50:23] as much of a sinner as anyone else in
[50:25] the world.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; That you are not better than anyone
[50:30] else. And when you drove, you may you
[50:32] may have seen some homeless people if
[50:33] you came on up on stone. You have to
[50:35] realize I am no better than that
[50:39] fentanyl addict
[50:41] that's assume the fentanyl position
[50:43] there. You are no better than that. And
[50:47] that is where you have to start. Listen
[50:50] uh to uh Romans chapter 3:9. I'll read
[50:54] the new New King James version of this.
[50:56] Romans chapter 3:9. It says this. What
[51:00] then? Are we better than they?
[51:04] Not at all. For we have previously
[51:07] charged both Jews and Greeks that they
[51:11] are all under sin.
[51:14] So he's saying that, hey, listen, all of
[51:16] us are sinners. Whoever you are, we are
[51:19] all sinners. As it is written, there is
[51:22] none righteous, know not one.
[51:25] There is none who understands. There is
[51:27] none who seeks after God. They have all
[51:30] turned aside. They have together become
[51:34] unprofitable. There is none who does
[51:37] does good. No, not one. You see how the
[51:40] apostles lowering
[51:43] all of us to say we are nothing. Their
[51:46] throat is an open tomb.
[51:49] With their tongues they have practiced
[51:51] deceit. The poison aspir lips whose
[51:55] mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.
[51:57] Their feet are swift to shed blood,
[51:59] destruction and misery are in their ways
[52:02] and the way of peace they have not
[52:04] known. There is no fear of God before
[52:07] their eyes. So these are both
[52:10] nonreligious and religious people he's
[52:12] talking about.
[52:13] Now we know that whatever the law says,
[52:17] it says to those who are under the law
[52:20] that every mouth may be stopped and all
[52:22] the world may become guilty before God.
[52:25] Therefore, by the deeds of the law, no
[52:28] flesh will be justified in his sight.
[52:32] For by the law is the knowledge of sin.
[52:36] So there's no salvation here in the law.
[52:39] The New Living Translation of that says,
[52:40] "For no one can ever be made right with
[52:43] God by doing what the law commands." The
[52:47] law simply shows us how sinful we are.
[52:51] Remember I was talking about your sins.
[52:53] Your sins will always be there. But now
[52:57] the righteousness of God apart from the
[53:00] law is revealed, being witnessed by the
[53:03] law and the prophets.
[53:06] even the righteousness of God through
[53:09] faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all
[53:13] who believe.
[53:15] For there is no difference for all have
[53:17] sinned and fall short of the glory of
[53:19] God.
[53:20] Being justified freely by his grace
[53:23] through the redemption that is in Christ
[53:24] Jesus whom God set forth as a
[53:27] perpetuation by his blood through faith
[53:29] to demonstrate his righteousness.
[53:31] Because in his forbearance, God has
[53:33] passed over the sins that were
[53:36] previously committed. Wow. God has
[53:39] passed over these sins that were
[53:40] previously committed to demonstrate at
[53:43] the present time his righteousness
[53:46] that he might be just and the justifier
[53:50] of one who has faith in Jesus.
[53:55] So it says, "No one is righteous, know
[53:57] not one." Verse number 22, even the
[54:00] righteousness of God through faith in
[54:02] Jesus Christ to all on who believe. So
[54:05] no, we are not righteous, but we are
[54:07] seeking his righteousness.
[54:10] Now listen to this. The Hebrews in in
[54:12] the book of Hebrews, it says that even
[54:15] the high priest, so the high priest on I
[54:17] believe it's called the day of
[54:18] atonement, the high priest would go into
[54:21] the temple. He would first make a
[54:23] sacrifice for his own sins and then he
[54:26] would make a sacrifice for the
[54:28] congregation. This is the one who lives
[54:30] perfect. This is the most perfect of the
[54:33] perfect, the high priest. He was the
[54:37] best living person. And yet he had to
[54:39] make an offering of sin for himself on
[54:43] that day of atonement once a year. But
[54:44] watch what Hebrews says.
[54:47] For such a high priest, verse number uh
[54:50] Hebrews 11:26,
[54:52] for such a high priest
[54:54] was fitting for us, who is holy,
[54:56] harmless, undefiled, un separate from
[54:59] sinners, and has become higher than the
[55:00] heavens, who does not need daily as
[55:05] those high priests
[55:08] to offer up sacrifices for his own sins,
[55:10] and then for the peoples. For this he
[55:12] did once for all and he offered up
[55:14] himself. For he offered up when he
[55:17] offered up himself. For the law appoints
[55:20] as high priest men who have weaknesses
[55:22] but the word of oath which came after
[55:24] the law appoints the son who has been
[55:27] perfected forever. Speaking of Jesus
[55:29] being the high priest.
[55:32] Now, it says, remember the day of
[55:34] atonement, but the book of Hebrews says
[55:37] that that high priest
[55:39] had to make an offering for his own sins
[55:41] every day.
[55:43] Remember, this is the most righteous of
[55:45] the righteous. He had to make a
[55:48] sacrifice or he should have made a
[55:50] sacrifice every day for his sins. So, we
[55:54] look and we we see how he could say
[55:56] there is none righteous. No, not one.
[55:58] Even the best were not righteous. Now we
[56:01] see that Jesus says now now your
[56:03] righteousness needs to exceed these
[56:05] Pharisees and scribes.
[56:09] How does how do we do that?
[56:12] How can we we do it? You might say,
[56:14] "Well, I have this sin and that sin and
[56:16] and how can I live up to this and I have
[56:19] to be my righteousness has to exceed
[56:21] these other people's righteousness? How
[56:23] can that be?" And it's beautiful. Let me
[56:27] give you let me tell a story in the
[56:29] Bible of something that happened.
[56:33] There was a woman. The Bible says that
[56:36] she was a sinner. Other translations say
[56:40] that she was immoral. That's a fact.
[56:43] That's not being accused of being
[56:45] immoral. The Bible says that she was
[56:48] immoral. What she did, I don't know, but
[56:51] it was not good.
[56:53] And she had there was something in her
[56:56] that she was
[56:59] she was just she was repentant and she
[57:01] wanted to change. Jesus had been invited
[57:04] to a Pharisees house for dinner. And
[57:08] when Jesus came in, he was he was
[57:11] obviously been walking. And you know how
[57:13] when we walk into somebody's house, just
[57:15] out of courtesy, we'll take our shoes
[57:16] off and leave them at the front door. We
[57:19] do that so we don't track in whatever we
[57:20] were walking through. and we came in a
[57:22] car and probably walked across a
[57:24] concrete driveway and then yet we take
[57:27] off our shoes. Jesus came into this man
[57:30] Simon's house and he was wearing sandals
[57:34] and all and he didn't have a car
[57:36] obviously. He was walking through
[57:38] whether it be mud or whether it be dust
[57:40] or dirt or whatever it was. He was
[57:43] walking miles probably and he comes to
[57:46] this this Pharisees house and he walks
[57:50] in and what was the custom back then is
[57:52] to take off your sandals and then they
[57:54] wash your feet. So now you're clean just
[57:56] like we would take off our shoes for the
[58:00] little bit of dirt. You can imagine how
[58:02] much dirt was on Jesus's feet when he
[58:04] walked in. But nobody washed his feet
[58:06] when he walked in. You know, you can't
[58:08] take off your feet when you walk into
[58:11] somebody's somebody's house back then.
[58:14] So they washed your feet. So Jesus comes
[58:16] in. Nobody washes his feet. He's sitting
[58:19] there with with dirty feet. And this
[58:22] woman who I said the Bible says was
[58:24] immoral.
[58:27] She purchases this expensive
[58:31] jar of perfume ointment,
[58:34] very expensive.
[58:36] And she there was something about her
[58:40] that repented. There was something sad
[58:42] about her. She regretted her sins. So
[58:46] she comes in
[58:48] and she sees Jesus sitting there and she
[58:51] walks in and falls down at his feet and
[58:56] begins kissing his feet. Her tears are
[58:59] flowing down, washing the dirt off of
[59:02] his feet. And she is taking this this
[59:06] ointment, this perfume, and perfuming
[59:08] him and and trying to make him to where
[59:10] he feels good. And here is this Pharisee
[59:14] over here and he's watching and he says,
[59:16] "If he was a prophet, surely he would
[59:18] know that she is a sinner." And you know
[59:21] what? She was.
[59:23] As I said, the Bible said she was.
[59:26] And she's there and she's weeping and
[59:28] she's repenting of her sins and doing
[59:31] all this. And Jesus looks at this
[59:33] Pharisee and he says, "Hey, Simon." He
[59:36] says, "What's your deal?"
[59:39] He says, 'When I walked in, you didn't
[59:40] even pay me enough respect to wash my
[59:42] feet. You wash everybody else's feet,
[59:44] but I come in, you don't clean me up.
[59:46] And here she is, and she is weeping, and
[59:48] she is washing my feet with her tears.
[59:51] You didn't anoint me with oil. I felt
[59:53] terrible. I come in, I'm I'm sweaty, I'm
[59:55] tired, and then she comes in. You didn't
[59:58] You didn't make give me some oil to to
[1:00:01] soothe the sun or whatever it is. She
[1:00:03] and she comes in and she takes this
[1:00:06] expensive oil and she she anoints me
[1:00:08] with this oil.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Who's righteous now? It's going to get
[1:00:14] better.
[1:00:16] Simon looks at him. He's obviously
[1:00:18] looking at what was going on in disgust.
[1:00:21] Disgusted. And he says, Jesus says,
[1:00:22] Simon, can I tell you a story? Can I say
[1:00:25] something? And then the Pharisees says,
[1:00:27] yeah, go ahead.
[1:00:29] He says
[1:00:31] there's two men.
[1:00:34] He says and and a man a rich man loaned
[1:00:38] one man 50 pieces of silver and the
[1:00:42] other man he loaned 500
[1:00:45] pieces of silver.
[1:00:47] He looks at looks at the Pharisee and he
[1:00:49] says
[1:00:51] neither of them could pay pay it back.
[1:00:53] Neither of them could pay the money
[1:00:55] back. So the man says, "I forgive both
[1:00:59] of you."
[1:01:02] And
[1:01:04] he says, "Now," he says, "Which one
[1:01:07] would love the man more? The man who he
[1:01:11] loaned 50 and forgave that or the man he
[1:01:14] loaned 500 pieces of silver and forgave
[1:01:16] that?" Pharisees said, "Well, I assume
[1:01:19] the one that he forgave more."
[1:01:22] He said, "You're right." He looks down
[1:01:27] and he tells her,
[1:01:30] the woman that's washing his feet, he
[1:01:32] says, "Your sins are forgiven."
[1:01:36] He says, "Now go in peace."
[1:01:38] Think about what Jesus said. She had 500
[1:01:44] 500 pieces of silver that she owed and
[1:01:48] she was forgiven. This Pharisee only had
[1:01:51] 50, but he wasn't forgiven any of it
[1:01:56] because he didn't ask for forgiveness.
[1:01:59] He still owed the 50. And he would still
[1:02:01] be condemned of the 50 because he did
[1:02:04] not see receive forgiveness because he
[1:02:06] wouldn't humble himself like the woman.
[1:02:08] Now, who had more righteousness? Was it
[1:02:11] the Pharisee or was it the woman? It was
[1:02:14] the woman.
[1:02:16] Do you see how her righteousness
[1:02:19] exceeded the righteousness of the
[1:02:21] legalistic
[1:02:23] Pharisee?
[1:02:25] Another story, Peter, he's up on the
[1:02:28] housetop and we can give our hearts to
[1:02:30] the Lord's friends. We can come and we
[1:02:32] can start coming to church and we can we
[1:02:35] can see our sins as Peter did and we can
[1:02:38] we can get our forgiveness and we can
[1:02:40] make things right with the Lord and we
[1:02:42] can still fall into the legalism. We can
[1:02:46] have the full understanding of Jesus
[1:02:48] Christ as Peter did. And yet, we can
[1:02:49] still fall back into it. It's very easy
[1:02:52] to do. Peter's on the housetop. He had
[1:02:55] received the Holy Ghost at the day of
[1:02:56] Pentecost. He had the kings to the to to
[1:02:59] the kingdom. Peter had he had it all. He
[1:03:03] was the leader. And here's Peter and
[1:03:05] he's up on the housetop. And he's
[1:03:08] praying. And there's another man over
[1:03:10] here named Cornelius, a lowly gentile.
[1:03:14] He was an important person. He was a
[1:03:16] centurion. But this man named Cornelius
[1:03:18] who in the Old Testament these were
[1:03:20] dirty people. Cornelius was praying.
[1:03:23] Peter was praying. Cornelius sees a
[1:03:25] vision to go to Peter. Peter sees a
[1:03:28] vision. And in this vision comes down
[1:03:33] all kinds of animals. Now remember the
[1:03:36] legalism of the Jews. You're not allowed
[1:03:38] to eat catfish because it doesn't have
[1:03:40] scales. You're not allowed to uh you're
[1:03:43] not allowed to eat shrimp. You're not
[1:03:44] allowed to eat crab. I love shrimp and
[1:03:47] crab. And I'm really glad that that's in
[1:03:50] the past,
[1:03:52] but but they weren't allowed to eat it.
[1:03:55] They weren't allowed to eat a rabbit.
[1:03:57] There were certain thing they weren't
[1:03:59] allowed to eat bacon.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, they weren't allow It's okay. They
[1:04:04] they got through it. But they weren't
[1:04:06] allowed to eat any They weren't allowed
[1:04:08] to eat any of that stuff. So here is
[1:04:10] Peter and Peter sees these animals
[1:04:14] coming down and maybe he saw a pig and a
[1:04:16] slab of bacon right there and the Lord
[1:04:18] says, "Peter, kill and eat." Now watch
[1:04:23] the legalism in Peter. Remember I Peter
[1:04:26] had given his heart to the Lord. He
[1:04:28] said, "Not so.
[1:04:31] I have never eaten any unclean in my
[1:04:33] life."
[1:04:36] And then God says this,
[1:04:39] "Why do you make unclean
[1:04:43] what I have cleansed?
[1:04:46] Why do you make common what I have made
[1:04:50] clean?" Even though it was all through
[1:04:53] his history, all through his tradition,
[1:04:56] it was no, you can't do this, you can't
[1:04:58] do that, you can't do this. And now God
[1:05:01] is rebuking Peter right there. Remember
[1:05:04] the lie, we see that the Old Testament
[1:05:07] laws of the diet were done away
[1:05:13] and it represented that lowly, dirty
[1:05:17] Gentile.
[1:05:20] And all of a sudden, Peter comes out of
[1:05:23] the vision. He's like, "What does that
[1:05:24] mean?"
[1:05:27] Um, can we talk to Peter? We were sent
[1:05:30] from Cornelius.
[1:05:32] He saw a vision to come see you. Peter's
[1:05:34] like, I'll be right there.
[1:05:37] And then he goes and he introduces these
[1:05:40] people to the Lord Jesus. Legalism
[1:05:43] doesn't work.
[1:05:45] Let's go back to Let's go back to um ah
[1:05:49] running out of time. Let's go back to uh
[1:05:52] Matthew chapter 5.
[1:05:58] You know, people
[1:06:01] And Keith, what we were talking about
[1:06:02] earlier,
[1:06:04] this sermon on the mount, we really have
[1:06:06] to understand that your righteousness
[1:06:10] cannot be dependent on you.
[1:06:13] It needs to be dependent on God. And
[1:06:15] people today think that they can fix
[1:06:16] themselves. They really do. They think
[1:06:19] that if they give their hearts to the
[1:06:20] the Lord, they say, "I I'm going to quit
[1:06:22] smoking. I'm going to quit drinking. I'm
[1:06:23] going to quit pornography. I'm going to
[1:06:24] quit being late for work. I'm going to
[1:06:25] quit missing church." And that is the
[1:06:27] legalist mentality. And it didn't work.
[1:06:31] and it doesn't work today. But it's
[1:06:33] still human nature to want to do those
[1:06:36] things. Instead of quitting something,
[1:06:39] start doing something.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Remember, I say a lot, it's not what you
[1:06:43] don't do for God that matters. It's what
[1:06:46] you do for him and trusting in him.
[1:06:49] Instead of quitting something, start
[1:06:51] doing something. If you want to quit
[1:06:52] missing church on Sunday mornings, start
[1:06:54] going on Wednesday nights. And then
[1:06:56] you'll find you'll go to you'll go on
[1:06:58] Sunday mornings, too. Start reading your
[1:07:00] Bible every morning. Start when you wake
[1:07:02] up, start praying. When you go to lunch,
[1:07:04] start praying. Pray during your lunch
[1:07:06] break. Before you go to bed, pray. Start
[1:07:08] reaching out to someone who needs you.
[1:07:11] Make that phone call. Send that card.
[1:07:15] Reach out and bring someone to lunch.
[1:07:19] Do something.
[1:07:21] Don't stop doing something. And you'll
[1:07:24] find that when you start doing
[1:07:26] something, the things that you want to
[1:07:28] stop doing, they just kind of fall away.
[1:07:30] You don't have the time to do them
[1:07:31] anymore. You don't want to do them
[1:07:33] anymore.
[1:07:35] You'll find that smoking and drinking
[1:07:37] and lying and gossiping and all of that.
[1:07:39] It just kind of gets squeezed out by
[1:07:42] doing Christianity. Christianity is not
[1:07:45] quitting. Christianity is doing.
[1:07:48] It's not doing. It's not which is, as I
[1:07:51] love saying, it's not what you don't do
[1:07:53] for God that matters.
[1:07:56] It's trusting in him, serving him, and
[1:07:59] doing what he says. Now, Jesus is going
[1:08:02] to make all that clear.
[1:08:04] Verse number 21, Matthew chapter 5.
[1:08:07] Listen to this. Remember what I said
[1:08:09] about going to the cliff.
[1:08:12] You have heard that it was said of the
[1:08:13] of them in old time, thou shalt not
[1:08:15] kill, and whosoever shall kill shall be
[1:08:17] in danger of the judgment.
[1:08:19] All right, you go right up. The law let
[1:08:23] you to sin, sin, sin, sin, sin all the
[1:08:25] way to right here. Nope, you can't kill.
[1:08:29] All right, and here's what Jesus is
[1:08:31] saying.
[1:08:34] You have heard that it was said of them
[1:08:35] of old time, thou shalt not kill, and
[1:08:37] whosoever shall kill shall be in danger
[1:08:40] of the judgment. But I say unto you,
[1:08:42] that whosoever is angry with his brother
[1:08:44] without a cause shall be in danger of
[1:08:46] the judgment. And whosoever shall say to
[1:08:49] his brother Raqqa shall be in danger of
[1:08:51] the council, but whosoever shall say,
[1:08:54] "Thou fool," shall be in danger of
[1:08:57] hellfire.
[1:09:00] Murder begins in the heart.
[1:09:04] Jesus is going he's he's going to the
[1:09:08] root of that problem.
[1:09:10] Murder is just the manifestation of
[1:09:12] something that started within.
[1:09:15] The law doesn't fix the heart. As I
[1:09:17] said, the law allows you to have hatred
[1:09:19] in your heart all the way until you
[1:09:22] commit that act. I was talking with I
[1:09:26] was talking uh the other day with my
[1:09:27] family and I was talking about the
[1:09:29] government shutdown and I was kind of
[1:09:30] worked up and and uh I said that they
[1:09:34] they're shutting the government down
[1:09:35] because they want to continue these
[1:09:37] COVID subsidies from from back in 2020.
[1:09:41] And I said, "These idiots don't
[1:09:42] understand that they are ruining our
[1:09:45] health care system." And something said
[1:09:48] sin.
[1:09:51] Call Noma and Rocka. That means
[1:09:52] worthless. Don't call anyone worthless.
[1:09:56] And don't call anyone a fool. And here I
[1:09:58] am, pastor of Tucson Tabernacle,
[1:10:01] breaking the commandment that Jesus
[1:10:03] said.
[1:10:05] And I apologized and I shouldn't have
[1:10:08] said that. But how often does it happen?
[1:10:10] Every day for us. And these people that
[1:10:13] killed that the one that shot um Donald
[1:10:17] Trump, hit him in the ear. It didn't
[1:10:21] start with murder. It started with
[1:10:24] hatred in his heart.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; And it just built and built and built
[1:10:29] until he came right to the line. The
[1:10:31] law, he would have been fine. And then
[1:10:33] boom, down he goes and he shoots him.
[1:10:36] The same one that uh
[1:10:38] with the one that killed Charlie Kirk.
[1:10:42] Same thing. This hatred built and built
[1:10:45] and built in him. His heart was wrong.
[1:10:50] It started wrong and then he comes right
[1:10:53] to the point and then he commits the
[1:10:55] sin. But Jesus is trying to get to the
[1:10:58] inner man. He's trying to get to the
[1:11:00] heart and say, "No, don't even start
[1:11:02] that way. Don't even say that the
[1:11:06] Democrats are idiots. Don't even say
[1:11:09] that. It starts that hatred. And don't
[1:11:13] say the Republicans are idiots either.
[1:11:16] It's Don't say anybody's an idiot. It
[1:11:18] starts that hatred
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; inside of you. And for 99% of the
[1:11:24] people, 99.99 whatever, it won't go to
[1:11:28] murder. But still, you are opening the
[1:11:31] door to murder. Let's continue on with
[1:11:33] what with what Jesus says here. He is so
[1:11:38] wise and he's still talking about murder
[1:11:40] in this next verse. Verse number 23.
[1:11:44] Therefore, if thou bring thy gift to the
[1:11:46] altar, and there rememberest that thy
[1:11:49] brother hath ought against thee,
[1:11:53] leave there thy gift before the altar,
[1:11:56] and go thy way, and first be reconciled
[1:11:59] to thy brother, and then come and offer
[1:12:02] thy gift.
[1:12:05] Notice that Jesus is saying someone that
[1:12:07] has something against you.
[1:12:10] He's not saying, of course, you
[1:12:11] shouldn't have anything against somebody
[1:12:13] else. But he's not saying that if you
[1:12:15] have something against someone, go and
[1:12:16] make it right. He's saying if someone
[1:12:18] has something against you, right or
[1:12:20] wrong.
[1:12:22] If someone has something against you
[1:12:26] that may they may think that you've done
[1:12:28] something against them, go to that
[1:12:30] person that hates you.
[1:12:33] Go in love. Go in wisdom.
[1:12:37] Go to that person with the right words.
[1:12:41] Go to that person in the way that you
[1:12:43] would want them to come to you if you
[1:12:45] felt they did something against you.
[1:12:48] Don't let that malice start up in your
[1:12:50] heart because it leads to murder.
[1:12:55] It can lead to murder.
[1:12:57] Agree with thine adversary quickly
[1:12:59] whilst thou art in the way with him,
[1:13:01] lest at any time the adversary delivered
[1:13:03] thee to the judge. and the judge deliver
[1:13:07] thee to the officer, and thou be cast
[1:13:09] into prison. Verily I say unto thee,
[1:13:11] thou shalt by no means come out hence
[1:13:14] till thou hast paid the uttermost
[1:13:16] farther." What is he talking about
[1:13:19] there? He's talking about a court case.
[1:13:21] You've heard of settling out of court.
[1:13:25] And the reason Jesus is saying that,
[1:13:28] he's saying you don't want to go to the
[1:13:31] judge because you don't know what you're
[1:13:32] going to get. You don't know how that
[1:13:35] judge is going to rule and there's too
[1:13:36] much at stake.
[1:13:39] You want to That's why most most cases
[1:13:41] are settled out of court because you
[1:13:43] know what you're going to get. You don't
[1:13:45] know what that jury's going to say. You
[1:13:47] don't know what that judge is going to
[1:13:48] say. You may be as confident as you want
[1:13:50] to be, but they might not agree with you
[1:13:52] and boom, you lose.
[1:13:56] And that's how it is with the Lord. get
[1:13:58] right now because you don't want to take
[1:14:00] a chance that that person is the one in
[1:14:03] the wrong and you're the one in the
[1:14:04] right. You don't want to take that
[1:14:06] chance. My grandma um Evans mama, she's
[1:14:11] great. She was a funny lady. She uh very
[1:14:15] southern. She was driving and she
[1:14:18] shouldn't have been driving. She was too
[1:14:19] old. But she was driving and there was a
[1:14:22] lady, another old lady crossing in a
[1:14:24] crosswalk in front of her and she just
[1:14:26] plows right into her.
[1:14:28] And she says, "Daniel," she says, "I
[1:14:33] couldn't believe that." She said, "That
[1:14:34] woman was on my windshield."
[1:14:39] And so it ends up in this big big
[1:14:43] litigation thing. And my dad and I went
[1:14:46] over to um to visit mama one day and she
[1:14:49] says she says, "Yeah." She says, "It's
[1:14:51] okay. We did a flea market."
[1:14:54] And dad said, "What?" She said, "We did
[1:14:56] a flea market."
[1:14:58] And uh dad says, "A flea market?" He
[1:15:00] says, "You mean a plea bargain?" He
[1:15:02] says, "Yeah." She says, "Yeah, that's
[1:15:03] what I mean. We Sister Carol's
[1:15:06] laughing." You knew mama.
[1:15:08] Um she uh the I'm sorry, Sister Roberta.
[1:15:13] You knew mama. But she uh she got her
[1:15:16] words mixed up. But you see, it was
[1:15:18] better to settle outside of court
[1:15:22] because she didn't know and neither did
[1:15:24] the woman know how the judge was going
[1:15:27] to rule. And Jesus here is saying you
[1:15:29] don't want to take that chance. He says
[1:15:32] make things right while you are here.
[1:15:36] You have heard when he says that you
[1:15:38] have heard it was said in old times.
[1:15:39] He's talking about you've read it in
[1:15:41] your Bible.
[1:15:44] He's talking about that these are the
[1:15:46] commandments of God. He says, "You have
[1:15:49] heard that it was said by them of old
[1:15:52] time, thou shalt not commit adultery.
[1:15:55] But I say unto you that whosoever looks
[1:15:57] on a woman to lust after her has
[1:16:00] committed adultery with her already in
[1:16:03] his heart."
[1:16:06] We automatically probably think about
[1:16:08] pornography here or we think about
[1:16:12] obviously it's lusting after someone
[1:16:14] who's not your spouse. I was
[1:16:18] um I knew a uh a woman and uh she was
[1:16:24] she had met she was married and uh she
[1:16:28] she was from the United States and then
[1:16:32] this other man was from Canada. Both of
[1:16:34] them had spouses and families and they
[1:16:37] started corresponding via Facebook,
[1:16:41] sharing scriptures
[1:16:44] and this the these two
[1:16:49] they started calling each other and
[1:16:52] praying together on the phone. Seems
[1:16:55] harmless, right?
[1:16:58] And they started conversing more and
[1:17:01] more. Do you see?
[1:17:03] Don't go not just go to the edge but
[1:17:07] this started way back deep in the heart
[1:17:12] where both of them open the door of
[1:17:15] their heart to the thought
[1:17:18] of this other person.
[1:17:22] They talked more and more. Eventually
[1:17:23] they decided to meet
[1:17:26] and they met and what happened
[1:17:27] eventually he divorced his wife. She
[1:17:30] divorced her husband and they got
[1:17:32] together an absolute case of adultery.
[1:17:37] But the heart was wrong. If they would
[1:17:41] have been right, they would have known
[1:17:42] that Holy Spirit would have told them,
[1:17:43] "Don't go there. Don't even think that
[1:17:45] that. Don't even entertain that
[1:17:46] thought." But instead, they went right
[1:17:49] up to the place thinking about it,
[1:17:51] thinking about it, thinking about it.
[1:17:52] And then they just jumped right into the
[1:17:54] sin. And Jesus is trying to attack here.
[1:17:58] He is saying that no you this is too far
[1:18:02] that the law let you go too far.
[1:18:04] Legalism lets you go too far. He wanted
[1:18:06] to get to the heart of the person
[1:18:10] rather than just the rules, just the
[1:18:12] law. Now here's so many people
[1:18:16] they say that a woman can entice a man
[1:18:19] into committing adultery by the way she
[1:18:22] is dressed. And I understand that. And
[1:18:23] and the sisters, the women should dress
[1:18:26] modestly. They should dress well. But I
[1:18:29] lay that 100%. I believe that scripture
[1:18:31] is talking about the man.
[1:18:33] That man has no right to look at a woman
[1:18:38] and want to have an affair with her.
[1:18:41] Want to that that open that door to
[1:18:44] where he might want to do that. Jesus
[1:18:48] here is saying, listen, if you do that,
[1:18:50] you are opening the door right at the
[1:18:52] beginning, the door to the heart. You're
[1:18:54] opening it up. And now what could happen
[1:18:56] next? What could happen next is boom,
[1:18:58] full-fledged adultery.
[1:19:00] And he's saying that listen, I know you
[1:19:05] may not have jumped over. You may not
[1:19:07] have stepped off that cliff of adultery,
[1:19:10] but if you are just entertaining the
[1:19:12] thought,
[1:19:14] then you've already done it.
[1:19:16] Then you just might just take the next
[1:19:18] step. The same thing with murder. He's
[1:19:20] like, if you just hate someone, if you
[1:19:21] call someone in a fool or something, you
[1:19:23] hate them. You're opening that door. How
[1:19:25] many times did this man that shot
[1:19:27] Charlie Kirk, How many times did he make
[1:19:29] fun of Charlie Kirk in the background?
[1:19:31] How many times did he call him names in
[1:19:34] the background? How many times did that
[1:19:36] happen and then it just manifested
[1:19:38] itself in murder?
[1:19:41] Jesus wants to get to the heart.
[1:19:44] He wants to get to where it begins.
[1:19:47] Amen. You with me? The worship team can
[1:19:50] come and we'll close.
[1:19:56] talks about we we we talk about the ten
[1:19:58] commandments and Jesus is going through
[1:20:00] the ten commandments and he he's saying
[1:20:03] that that no that that they were right
[1:20:08] you shouldn't do these sins but this sin
[1:20:12] it starts way back in another place you
[1:20:16] are just seeing the manifestation
[1:20:18] of these sins and then you see this
[1:20:21] precious ious little lady who was a
[1:20:25] sinner. She was immoral. What she did,
[1:20:28] we don't know, but it wasn't good.
[1:20:31] It was not something that she would want
[1:20:33] to brag about. And it was not something
[1:20:35] that we would want to brag about. But
[1:20:37] here she is. And what did she do? Why
[1:20:40] did her righteousness exceed the
[1:20:42] righteousness of that Pharisee?
[1:20:46] Is because she was willing to say, "I'm
[1:20:48] a sinner."
[1:20:50] She was willing to say that I am a
[1:20:51] nothing. She was willing to say, "Lord,
[1:20:54] I give my heart to you. I give myself to
[1:20:57] you and I'll do whatever I can." And the
[1:21:01] 500 pieces of silver were forgiven.
[1:21:06] But the little bit that the Pharisee
[1:21:08] owed, the 50 pieces
[1:21:10] never forgiven.
[1:21:12] He was condemned
[1:21:14] for that debt that he owed. You
[1:21:18] understand the meaning behind the
[1:21:19] parable of the Lord Jesus and why he put
[1:21:23] it there with with this woman and and
[1:21:25] with the Pharisees.
[1:21:28] Do you understand this sermon on the
[1:21:30] mount?
[1:21:32] Understand how amazing it is? This is
[1:21:35] Jesus. This is his first public sermon.
[1:21:39] And here he is and he is saying that no,
[1:21:42] the Old Testament's good. The Old
[1:21:44] Testament's right. I fulfilled it.
[1:21:48] I am that lamb
[1:21:51] and oh and the ten commandments that's
[1:21:53] right.
[1:21:55] But think about this. What about your
[1:21:57] heart? So you can lust after someone and
[1:22:01] still be right? No. Jesus goes all the
[1:22:04] way back to that inner man, to that
[1:22:07] inner person.
[1:22:09] And then that's where he is. That's
[1:22:11] where he's focused on. And we cannot be
[1:22:13] saved by the outward person. It can't
[1:22:16] happen. The only way that we can be
[1:22:18] saved is if God changes that inward
[1:22:21] person. Amen. I don't think, brother
[1:22:24] Arie, we don't have a baptism. Or do we?
[1:22:27] We don't.
[1:22:29] I don't think so. Is anybody Is there
[1:22:31] anybody that want to be baptized this
[1:22:33] morning?
[1:22:36] Okay, good. Friends, sermon on the
[1:22:38] mount. Keep reading it. Let's stay in
[1:22:40] this. I it seems like I only get to like
[1:22:43] two two two
[1:22:44] verses per but as I said it's okay.
[1:22:47] we'll just keep going. And and if if
[1:22:49] we're raptured, if the Lord comes before
[1:22:51] we finish, then maybe can you imagine
[1:22:54] Jesus and just sitting down
[1:22:58] and Jesus and saying, "Lord, would you
[1:23:02] preach the sermon on the mount to us?"
[1:23:04] And oh man, and then he could go in and
[1:23:08] he can elaborate on them and and just
[1:23:10] say those words and maybe say like,
[1:23:14] "Brother Manny, this is what this is
[1:23:16] what pertains to you in this. And this
[1:23:18] is how you overcame in this. And sister
[1:23:21] Shirley, way back when when you went
[1:23:23] through this, this is how I carried you
[1:23:26] through."
[1:23:28] And
[1:23:29] the more that we're into the word,
[1:23:31] friends, the more that the blessings we
[1:23:34] receive. As I said, stop looking at the
[1:23:38] sins.
[1:23:40] Especially stop looking at the sins of
[1:23:42] other people. Then you don't want to
[1:23:45] fall into that same boat as the
[1:23:46] Pharisee. But stop looking at your own
[1:23:48] sins, too. When you start focusing on
[1:23:51] God, those sins, they just fall off. You
[1:23:55] don't have to worry about them.
[1:23:58] [Music]
[1:24:01] As the deer,
[1:24:06] as the deer panteth for
[1:24:12] the water, so my soul longeth after
[1:24:20] thee.
[1:24:25] You alone
[1:24:28] are my heart's
[1:24:31] desire
[1:24:33] and I long
[1:24:36] to worship
[1:24:38] you. Would you stand with me and let's
[1:24:40] sing that verse again?
[1:24:43] As the deer panteth for
[1:24:49] the water, so my soul longeth after
[1:24:57] thee.
[1:25:01] You alone
[1:25:05] are my heart's
[1:25:08] desire
[1:25:09] and I long
[1:25:12] to worship
[1:25:15] thee.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; You alone
[1:25:22] are my strength, my shield.
[1:25:27] To you
[1:25:31] made my spirit
[1:25:34] near.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; You alone
[1:25:42] are my heart's
[1:25:44] desire and I long
[1:25:49] to worship
[1:25:51] you.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; You're my friend.
[1:25:56] You're my friend and you are
[1:26:02] my brother even though
[1:26:06] you are a king.
[1:26:10] [Music]
[1:26:13] I love you more than any
[1:26:19] other so much more
[1:26:23] than anything.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; You alone
[1:26:33] are my strength, my shield.
[1:26:38] to you alone.
[1:26:42] May my spirit.
[1:26:47] [Music]
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; You alone
[1:26:53] are my heart
[1:26:56] desire
[1:26:57] and I long
[1:27:00] to worship
[1:27:03] you.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; So do you see
[1:27:08] that your righteousness
[1:27:11] can far out outstretched can far exceed
[1:27:16] the righteousness of any man or any
[1:27:18] woman, your righteousness. If you
[1:27:22] receive Christ's righteousness
[1:27:26] into your heart,
[1:27:28] then the rules and the regulations and
[1:27:31] and the um the the laws then they become
[1:27:36] living inside of you.
[1:27:39] And now it's not adultery
[1:27:43] that you commit. It's not murder that
[1:27:46] you commit.
[1:27:49] it's
[1:27:51] lusting or it's hating or it's calling
[1:27:55] names there. Now the Lord just keeps
[1:27:58] refining and refining and refining and
[1:28:02] then holiness becomes real in the person
[1:28:06] and then that person becomes a living
[1:28:08] representative of Jesus Christ and then
[1:28:11] you have a burden for others. Amen.
[1:28:14] Let's bow our heads.
[1:28:21] Lord,
[1:28:23] thank you for the wisdom that is in your
[1:28:25] word.
[1:28:27] Thank you, Father, that
[1:28:30] Jesus Christ himself, God made flesh,
[1:28:35] came and and preached the word to us.
[1:28:38] And it's been preserved for these 2,000
[1:28:41] years that we might read it on Sunday
[1:28:44] morning here in Tucson, Arizona.
[1:28:47] and Lord that the meaning is still there
[1:28:50] and it hasn't changed. We thank you
[1:28:53] Father. Pray Lord that if there'd be
[1:28:56] someone here in this congregation
[1:29:00] they came here Father expecting
[1:29:03] something
[1:29:05] that they wanted Lord maybe a a question
[1:29:08] to be answered.
[1:29:11] They wanted healing
[1:29:14] Lord. Maybe there was confusion.
[1:29:17] I pray, Father, that
[1:29:20] these words from our Lord Jesus
[1:29:23] on the sermon on the mount would have
[1:29:25] answered the question, given them faith.
[1:29:27] Father,
[1:29:29] now as we go forward,
[1:29:32] Father, I pray that you would guide and
[1:29:34] protect each one,
[1:29:37] Lord, that your healing hand be upon
[1:29:40] each one.
[1:29:43] Lord, that we could be
[1:29:46] a representative to you,
[1:29:48] Lord, that we would take on your
[1:29:50] righteousness
[1:29:53] and be a light to the world. Father, we
[1:29:55] pray. We love you and we thank you in
[1:29:57] Jesus name. Amen.

[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell the story about mama. I
[1:32:30] wouldn't have told it if if the lady
[1:32:31] would have been hurt. She she was she
[1:32:33] was just beat up a little bit, but uh it
[1:32:36] was a very funny very funny story. And
[1:32:39] I'm glad that they settled with the flea
