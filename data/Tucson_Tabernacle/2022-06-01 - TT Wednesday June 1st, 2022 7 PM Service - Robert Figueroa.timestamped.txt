[28:32] to brother robert figaro he's come to
[28:34] minister for us this evening
[28:36] this thing welcome welcome holy spirit
[28:38] as he comes this evening
[28:42] [Music]
[28:54] legos
[28:55] [Music]
[29:09] this very
[29:11] [Music]
[29:20] we
[29:21] will come thee
[29:26] [Music]
[29:36] oh
[29:41] [Applause]
[29:43] [Music]
[29:51] this
[29:53] [Applause]
[29:58] [Music]
[30:00] [Applause]
[30:03] we
[30:04] will
[30:06] come thee
[30:09] we were taught by
[30:11] the prophet that
[30:13] that the holy spirit is a very sensitive
[30:15] nature
[30:17] and he won't come unless he's invited
[30:21] even though we can invite him with our
[30:23] lips
[30:24] but we need to invite him with our heart
[30:27] whereas
[30:28] satan
[30:30] he'll come whether he's invited or not
[30:33] if you just give him an opportunity
[30:36] he'll come in
[30:39] he won't ask permission
[30:41] he'll take control
[30:43] he'll try to destroy you just you'll try
[30:45] to destroy me
[30:47] but the holy spirit so
[30:49] so different from that
[30:52] brother brahmana said that
[30:54] that when we
[30:56] when we
[30:57] grieve
[30:58] the holy ghost
[31:00] he's like a dove and he takes his flight
[31:04] is that right
[31:06] he doesn't he doesn't go very far
[31:09] but he waits
[31:12] he sits there and waits until we make it
[31:14] right he cannot live
[31:17] in an unclean vessel
[31:21] that vessel's got to be clean
[31:24] so as we invite him this evening one
[31:26] more time
[31:28] if there's anything in your life right
[31:30] now
[31:31] just ask god say lord
[31:34] would you take this from me lord
[31:36] would you clean me cleanse me and wash
[31:38] me
[31:39] in your blood
[31:41] forgive me my mistakes my
[31:43] maybe something we've done in ignorance
[31:45] maybe sometimes we can grieve
[31:48] the holy ghost
[31:50] and as we do this this evening
[31:53] then we'll we'll sing that as you sing
[31:55] it ask god to forgive you and to cleanse
[31:57] you and say holy ghost we make you
[32:00] welcome
[32:01] let's sing that one more time this this
[32:03] evening
[32:06] amen
[32:08] [Music]
[32:09] can you put that on thank you
[32:11] welcome
[32:14] [Music]
[32:26] we will
[32:29] come
[32:30] thee
[32:32] come
[32:33] [Music]
[32:34] in power
[32:37] this very
[32:40] [Music]
[32:54] just came to my mind right now a little
[32:56] story that
[32:57] brother larry guerra told me years ago
[33:01] they were living in california and
[33:03] and uh he was in a certain room there in
[33:06] the house and
[33:07] i believe his sister was
[33:09] watching something on tv
[33:12] it was something about a witch or
[33:14] something and she saw something that
[33:15] brother right brother larry
[33:17] she saw something come out of that out
[33:19] of that screen
[33:22] and she felt it come into her
[33:24] and below there was another room the
[33:25] people the other family members were in
[33:27] the rooms and
[33:28] and he's and according to testimony she
[33:31] began to scream like a crazy woman
[33:35] and everybody ran into the room what's
[33:37] going on what what is this and she and
[33:39] she entered through her screams and her
[33:42] her her
[33:43] her
[33:44] terror
[33:46] she said something had come out of that
[33:48] tv into her
[33:50] and they had to pray over her she was
[33:52] delivered with that see satan don't ask
[33:53] permission
[33:55] just open just open the way for him
[33:58] he'll come in
[34:00] he'll come in uninvited
[34:02] and he'll tear your life apart
[34:05] that's what he is
[34:07] but the holy spirit
[34:09] if we can just cleanse the vessel
[34:12] long enough
[34:14] and open our heart to him
[34:16] and say lord would you come into my
[34:18] heart
[34:19] would you come and live in me lord
[34:22] he'll come
[34:24] he'll come every time he's invited
[34:26] there in the scriptures we know there
[34:28] was a there was a pharisee that invited
[34:30] him
[34:31] and whenever he's invited he'll come
[34:34] we may not make him welcome
[34:37] we could be in this sanctuary this this
[34:39] evening and
[34:41] we could be saying welcome welcome holy
[34:43] spirit but our heart is closed
[34:47] and that's that's what the pharisees
[34:49] simon believe his name was
[34:51] he invited him
[34:53] and they didn't greet him they didn't
[34:55] kiss him at the door they didn't anoint
[34:57] him they didn't wash his feet but he
[34:59] came
[35:00] anyway
[35:02] that's our lord
[35:03] [Music]
[35:04] so different
[35:06] amen
[35:07] it's good for us to have an
[35:08] understanding of the nature of god
[35:11] and also the nature of the enemy
[35:14] that we will be on guard amen
[35:17] amen if you have your bibles this
[35:19] evening like to turn to the scriptures
[35:21] i'd like to thank brother aaron for
[35:24] inviting me coming kind of by surprise
[35:26] this morning
[35:27] on short notice
[35:29] but
[35:30] i already i had a message ready in case
[35:32] he did call me
[35:34] and uh
[35:35] because he's getting shorter and shorter
[35:37] in the times that he gives me
[35:39] he might call me one of these eight to
[35:41] six o'clock and say brother can you be
[35:42] here at seven
[35:45] and we always need to be ready amen
[35:48] and i believe that uh
[35:50] when god calls you he'll
[35:52] he'll equip you
[35:55] he doesn't call the equipped he equips
[35:57] the co he he equips those he calls
[36:02] and is by his grace and it's a learning
[36:04] thing
[36:05] i can remember many years ago
[36:08] standing in this very pulpit
[36:10] and preaching to about four or 500
[36:12] people in this church on a sunday
[36:14] morning
[36:15] and brother greene sitting behind me
[36:18] and i'd be just a rack of nerves
[36:21] and just fumbling my words and you saw
[36:24] how brother jordan kind of messed up a
[36:26] little bit up here but the ones that are
[36:28] doing something for god are the ones
[36:29] that are going to mess up
[36:32] you know just get up here let's do
[36:34] mistakes go play the piano make a
[36:35] mistake
[36:37] amen be a deacon or do something serve
[36:39] some other people and then make a
[36:41] mistake it's okay you're doing something
[36:43] for god because we're imperfect every
[36:45] one of us amen
[36:47] this turns to luke chapter 13
[36:50] verses 22 and 24
[36:53] luke 13 22-24 my message this evening is
[36:57] titled god's called and chosen
[37:00] god's called and chosen
[37:04] and he went through the cities and
[37:05] villages
[37:07] teaching
[37:08] and journeying
[37:10] toward jerusalem
[37:12] then said one unto him lord
[37:15] are there few
[37:16] that be saved
[37:18] and he said unto them
[37:20] strive
[37:22] to enter in at the straight gate
[37:25] for many
[37:27] i say unto you
[37:29] will seek to enter in
[37:32] and shall not be able
[37:35] and that's really something that's quite
[37:36] a statement for the lord to make
[37:39] that there will be many
[37:42] they're going to want to enter in
[37:46] but they're not going to be able
[37:49] this evening
[37:52] if you feel god's called you you're
[37:54] blessed
[37:57] you're blessed because
[37:59] there's many out there
[38:01] would want to be called but if god has
[38:04] not elected you
[38:07] or anyone
[38:09] they can strive all they want
[38:11] but this evening i believe you're here
[38:13] this evening because god has called you
[38:16] there's there's something in your heart
[38:19] amen
[38:20] that this is holding you something in
[38:22] your heart just pulling you
[38:25] even when you can't even take another
[38:27] step when it's hard to even face another
[38:30] day as a song said when i'm overwhelmed
[38:34] yet there's something on the inside
[38:37] we can't explain it
[38:40] we can't take it out and show it to
[38:41] someone
[38:42] but it's there
[38:44] nonetheless and we can't get away from
[38:47] it
[38:48] you can't run from it
[38:50] amen
[38:51] maybe some of you have tried to run from
[38:53] it
[38:54] and you found you can't get away from
[38:55] him
[38:57] because he's called you
[38:59] amen let us pray father this evening as
[39:01] we

[40:06] we bless your name tonight lord be with
[40:08] us now that we do we ask it in jesus
[40:10] name and the church said
[40:12] god bless you may be seated this evening
[40:16] in matthew
[40:17] chapter 20 verse 16
[40:20] the bible says and so the last
[40:23] shall be first
[40:25] and the first last
[40:27] for many be called
[40:30] but few chosen
[40:32] think about that
[40:34] many called
[40:36] but few chosen
[40:39] in john 3 16
[40:41] i read one time where john 3 16 is the
[40:44] most known scripture in the bible
[40:48] and
[40:50] it it actually i preached on it here
[40:52] some years ago many years ago
[40:54] and i explained that that john 3 16
[40:58] if there's a is there's a verse of
[41:00] scripture in the bible that tells the
[41:02] whole story
[41:04] in just a few words it's john 3 16.
[41:08] think about it
[41:10] and that's that's what the bible is all
[41:12] about
[41:13] that's what the scriptures are all about
[41:15] it's about
[41:17] god coming down
[41:18] and dying for us
[41:20] and saving us
[41:22] for god's soul loved the world
[41:27] that he gave his only begotten son
[41:31] that whosoever
[41:32] there there's that many are called
[41:35] whosoever
[41:37] amen
[41:39] believeth in him
[41:42] should not perish
[41:44] but have
[41:46] everlasting life there is that whosoever
[41:49] many are called
[41:51] but few are chosen as preachers
[41:55] i i've been many times as an evangelist
[41:57] for well many years with
[41:59] from this church
[42:01] and i got to preach in places like peru
[42:03] and
[42:04] and
[42:05] in venezuela and brazil
[42:08] and and even later on in trinidad and
[42:11] all through mexico with brother larry
[42:13] and i we visited a lot of places a lot
[42:16] of towns and cities
[42:18] and i've even preached in mexico city
[42:21] in some meetings over there that was
[42:22] held by brother francisco olgin
[42:25] and probably about there must have been
[42:27] at least 1500 people there and so we
[42:30] through my in my little ministry that i
[42:32] have
[42:33] uh
[42:34] you know you you take the gospel is like
[42:37] a net you just cast it out
[42:40] and and you know it's like a fisherman
[42:42] to cast that net out and he brings it in
[42:45] well he brings in
[42:47] turtles he brings in
[42:48] sea snakes and
[42:50] and who knows what else comes in there
[42:53] but there's fish in there
[42:56] the net was put out for the fish but all
[42:58] these other things got in there
[43:00] but there's actual fish
[43:03] and that's what the gospel net is
[43:05] we throw the gospel in it saying
[43:07] whosoever
[43:09] if he will come if you will believe
[43:12] but when it comes right down to it
[43:14] many are called with fear chosen
[43:18] in matthew 7 13 and 14 again
[43:21] this is another
[43:23] uh of the same thing we just read this
[43:26] this evening on luke
[43:27] he says enter ye in at the straight gate
[43:31] for wide is the gate
[43:34] and broad is the way
[43:37] that leadeth to destruction
[43:41] and many
[43:43] there be
[43:45] which go in there
[43:48] you think of a way like something like
[43:50] a broad highway
[43:52] just vast
[43:54] and people of breasts are going and
[43:56] they're going down that way
[43:59] and they're going to destruction
[44:02] and then there's another place another
[44:04] way that he speaks about
[44:07] he says because straight is a gate
[44:10] and narrow
[44:12] is the way
[44:15] which leadeth unto life
[44:18] and feuder be defined it
[44:22] i'm going to read that read that again
[44:23] because straight is the gate
[44:26] and narrow
[44:28] is the way
[44:30] the masses are not going down uh are not
[44:32] going up that that way
[44:35] it leadeth unto life
[44:38] and few
[44:40] there be defined it because that man
[44:41] asked him will there be few
[44:44] he said yeah there's going to be a few
[44:46] brother brahms said there were very
[44:48] few and
[44:51] you know but
[44:52] if you put in a world population i don't
[44:54] know the map they might there's they say
[44:55] there's what 3 million or so believers
[44:58] in this message or worldwide
[45:00] and of those 3 million how many are
[45:03] true seed i don't know
[45:06] but there might be several hundred
[45:07] thousand but worldwide
[45:10] so just make sure you're one of them
[45:13] amen
[45:15] the bible says that the kingdom of
[45:17] heaven until the days of john the
[45:18] baptist the kingdom of heaven suffered
[45:20] violence
[45:22] and the violent
[45:23] take it by force
[45:26] god's looking for violent people
[45:28] people that have backbone that are they
[45:31] they see the promise and they take it
[45:33] like jacob did he grabbed a hold of that
[45:35] angel he says i'm not gonna let you go
[45:38] see that's what god that's what god
[45:40] wants in this we want to have that kind
[45:42] of determination
[45:44] to have a backbone
[45:46] oh
[45:47] brother aaron didn't even shake my hand
[45:49] i'm not going back
[45:51] so backbone than that
[45:54] amen is that all it takes you to to stop
[45:56] coming to church
[45:58] someone just rubbed you wrong a little
[46:00] bit
[46:01] no no
[46:02] guys looking for people with backbone
[46:03] people there they have experience people
[46:05] that that that are full of the holy
[46:07] ghost amen
[46:09] amen hallelujah
[46:11] good preaching brother robert
[46:15] so straight is the gate
[46:18] there's a little uh where i live over
[46:19] here we we moved out of our home in
[46:21] benson
[46:23] and it was just too big for my wife and
[46:24] i now that we're alone and
[46:26] and uh elizabeth she's got a 10-acre
[46:30] parcel over off sonoya highway
[46:32] and they've got a a little apartment
[46:35] there and
[46:36] and uh so we live in a little apartment
[46:38] my wife in a little studio apartment for
[46:40] time being until our house gets sold
[46:43] and uh
[46:45] there's a little uh
[46:47] trail that leads it to their house and
[46:49] it goes down into like a
[46:52] royal
[46:53] not really on the road but yeah it is an
[46:55] arroyo it is but they got it covered
[46:57] over and then up so you go down and i
[47:00] found that when you go down it's easy
[47:03] now if you've ever been on a trail go
[47:04] through the hike
[47:06] you ever been to
[47:07] up in mount lammon or maybe grand canyon
[47:10] you like that you know what i'm talking
[47:11] about going down is easy that's the easy
[47:14] way
[47:14] you see and i believe that that highway
[47:18] with all those masses
[47:20] it's going down that's the easy way
[47:22] and then there's another little trail
[47:24] that once i get to the other side i get
[47:26] down to the bottom and i just have to go
[47:28] go up and that's hard
[47:31] by the time i get to the top i'm out of
[47:32] breath
[47:33] and the back of my legs are hurting
[47:36] but it's hard to go up
[47:38] you know when jesus left he ascended
[47:41] amen
[47:42] he didn't descend he ascended
[47:45] i want you to keep that in your mind and
[47:47] keep that picture in your mind of this
[47:48] this highway
[47:50] just full of people
[47:53] the majority and they're all going down
[47:57] that
[47:58] that road
[47:59] and then there's this way
[48:01] it's hard
[48:03] straight as a gate
[48:05] and there was a way
[48:07] and few
[48:09] there be defined it
[48:11] if we're going up that way i think we're
[48:13] going one we're going in single file
[48:16] i don't think there's even enough room
[48:18] to stand abreast with somebody each one
[48:21] we're all it's as individuals amen
[48:25] we're going to all meet god as
[48:26] individuals we're all going to be judged
[48:29] as individuals
[48:31] you're not going to be judged because
[48:32] daddy was a saint her mama was a scene
[48:35] amen you're going to stand paul said we
[48:38] will all stand before his tribunal
[48:40] we're being judged right now i believe
[48:45] in romans 9 16
[48:48] so then it is not of him
[48:51] that willeth
[48:53] nor of him that runeth
[48:56] but of god
[48:58] that show with mercy
[49:00] wow
[49:02] we're here tonight
[49:04] as god
[49:06] showed us mercy
[49:09] we're here tonight
[49:11] because we were foreordained
[49:14] hallelujah
[49:16] we are the church of the predestinated
[49:20] far ordained amen
[49:22] before there was brother madam says
[49:24] before there was a world before there
[49:25] was an angel before there was an adam
[49:28] we were in his thoughts
[49:31] and he already knew us
[49:33] he knew the life that we would live the
[49:36] choices we would make in life and how we
[49:38] would choose him
[49:40] and god through that through his
[49:42] foreknowledge
[49:43] he elected us
[49:45] lest it be his name
[49:48] and so it's not anyone could say well
[49:49] i'm going to be a christian
[49:51] well
[49:53] it doesn't work that way
[49:55] you could try because jesus said many
[49:57] will strive to enter in
[50:01] amen
[50:03] but they're not going to make it
[50:05] and it's not of him that willeth
[50:08] nor of him
[50:09] that runeth
[50:11] but of him that of whom god showeth
[50:13] mercy
[50:14] romans 9 and 6
[50:20] thank you for the water appreciate that
[50:24] not as though the word of god
[50:26] hath
[50:27] taken none effect
[50:30] for they are not all israel
[50:33] which are of israel
[50:36] neither because they are the seed of
[50:38] abraham
[50:40] are they all children
[50:43] in isaac shall thy seed be called
[50:46] remember now
[50:47] abraham
[50:48] had other children
[50:49] other than isaac
[50:51] he had
[50:52] ishmael but it was through isaac
[50:56] that the election came
[50:59] and jacob had no choice
[51:03] he never had a choice ishmael never had
[51:05] a choice
[51:07] you know it was it was through jacob
[51:09] excuse me or isaac and isaac never had a
[51:11] choice against still but isaac never had
[51:14] a choice and jacob never had a choice he
[51:17] was born through isaac
[51:19] amen
[51:21] and those that came out of ishmael
[51:23] they didn't have a choice
[51:27] that is they verse 8 which are the
[51:30] children of the flesh
[51:32] these are not the children of god
[51:34] but the children of the promise are
[51:37] counted for the seed
[51:38] so ishmael went off with his line
[51:41] and they were not the children of god
[51:43] they were the children of abraham
[51:45] to this day
[51:47] they call themselves the children of
[51:49] abraham and they are
[51:51] but they're not the seed
[51:54] there was a separation
[51:56] there was a separation there
[51:58] that is it says verse 9 for this is the
[52:01] word of promise
[52:03] at this time will i come and sarah shall
[52:05] have a son
[52:07] not only this but when rebecca also had
[52:11] conceived by one
[52:13] even by our father isaac
[52:15] for the children
[52:17] being not yet born
[52:21] neither having done any good or evil
[52:25] that the purpose of god according to
[52:27] election
[52:28] you see the election there is a purpose
[52:30] of god
[52:31] according to election
[52:34] god has a purpose in that
[52:37] not of works
[52:39] not he that willeth not he that runeth
[52:41] not of works
[52:43] but of him
[52:44] that calleth
[52:47] there it is there's a key there's the
[52:49] election but of him to calleth it was
[52:51] said unto her the elder shall serve the
[52:53] younger
[52:54] as it is written jacob have i loved but
[52:57] esau have i hated there was a war in
[52:59] that room you know that don't you
[53:01] they fought each other
[53:03] and and and it looked like jacob was
[53:06] going to come and all of a sudden he got
[53:07] pulled back and here comes esau
[53:10] and when esau came out jacob had a hold
[53:12] of his of his foot i believe it was
[53:15] they were fighting in there for that
[53:17] for that promise of to be a firstborn
[53:24] what shall we say then
[53:26] is there unrighteousness
[53:28] with god
[53:30] god forbid
[53:32] because you got to remember that that
[53:34] election and that foreign knowledge
[53:36] comes through his knowledge of what
[53:38] we would choose
[53:40] because there is there is there is a
[53:42] choice in that
[53:44] a free moral agency is is what i want to
[53:47] say
[53:48] we're all free moral agents
[53:51] we have that ability to choose
[53:55] and and because of that god knew
[53:57] what our choosing would be
[54:00] and god chose us the elected and called
[54:02] us from that
[54:04] for he saith to moses verse 15
[54:08] i will have mercy on whom i will have
[54:11] mercy and i will have compassion on whom
[54:14] i will have compassion
[54:16] don't though so then it is not of him
[54:18] that willeth nor him that runeth but of
[54:21] god to show of mercy for the scripture
[54:23] saith unto pharaoh
[54:25] even for this same purpose have i raised
[54:28] thee up
[54:29] that i might show my power in thee
[54:32] and that my name might be declared
[54:34] throughout all the earth
[54:37] you see he didn't raise pharaoh up to
[54:39] save him
[54:42] he didn't raise pharaoh up to make him a
[54:44] child of god
[54:46] he raised pharaoh up to show his power
[54:49] because he knew pharaoh was going to
[54:51] withstand him
[54:52] he knew pharaoh would stand against
[54:54] moses he knew pharaoh would stand
[54:56] against the people of israel the jewish
[54:58] people
[55:00] and and so pharaoh came at that time
[55:03] there was an appointed time for him to
[55:04] be upon the earth
[55:06] that he might show forth what he was
[55:10] therefore have he mercy on whom he will
[55:13] have mercy and whom he will he hardeneth
[55:18] he hardeneth
[55:20] remember he hardened his heart
[55:23] it wasn't for that heart was not made to
[55:26] receive the word of god it was made to
[55:29] be hardened
[55:31] but yet there is there's warnings in the
[55:33] scriptures for us
[55:36] they're in hebrews paul says take heed
[55:39] lest there be in any of you
[55:44] an evil heart
[55:45] of unbelief
[55:48] a hardened heart
[55:50] in departing for the living god
[55:53] amen we got to be careful
[55:56] because our heart can be hardened
[55:59] read that scripture take it there in
[56:01] hebrews somewhere you'll find it and
[56:02] there he talks about the hearting of the
[56:04] heart
[56:07] we have to be careful of the heart that
[56:09] we that god has given us the heart when
[56:11] it's we're talking about the heart we're
[56:12] not talking about this organ it's
[56:14] pumping blood
[56:16] it is the essence of who you are the
[56:18] heart
[56:21] the the heart of man is is is used
[56:24] interchangeably with soul and heart soul
[56:27] and heart it's the same thing it's who
[56:30] you are and on the inside the real you
[56:35] jesus said
[56:36] a good man out of the good treasure of
[56:38] his heart bringeth forth good things
[56:42] and an evil man out of the evil treasure
[56:46] bringeth forth evil things
[56:50] and he goes out and he says but i say to
[56:52] you that every idle word that man shall
[56:55] speak
[56:56] they she shall give her the count
[56:58] thereof
[57:00] for by thy word thou shall be justified
[57:02] and by thy words thou shalt be condemned
[57:05] jesus said that out of the abundance of
[57:07] the heart
[57:09] the mouth
[57:10] speaketh
[57:12] so what comes out of our mouth is coming
[57:14] out of our heart
[57:17] so you want to know where you stand
[57:18] watch what you say
[57:20] i always say be careful of what you say
[57:23] i would say get the heart changed
[57:26] take a change of heart
[57:28] be born again by the spirit of god
[57:31] that that heart will be changed amen
[57:34] so when when you do speak
[57:36] you'll speak good things
[57:39] you'll speak blessings
[57:41] you'll speak the positive things of god
[57:43] the yea and the amen of god
[57:50] verse 19
[57:51] thou will say unthen unto me why does he
[57:54] yet find fault for who has resisted his
[57:57] will
[57:58] nay but o man who art thou that replies
[58:01] against god
[58:02] shall the thing formed say to him that
[58:05] formed it
[58:06] why has all made me thus
[58:09] hath not the potter
[58:11] power over the clay
[58:13] of the same lump to make one vessel unto
[58:16] honor
[58:18] and another unto dishonor
[58:21] i can remember
[58:22] many years ago by the larry in
[58:25] guadalajara
[58:27] that brother brother took also with that
[58:28] that place and they when they made the
[58:30] pottery and the man was pit with the
[58:32] little petals and and he was forming
[58:34] that thing and well if you if he didn't
[58:36] like it you just take it throw it aside
[58:38] or or remake it and that and you know we
[58:41] sing the song about where it's a potter
[58:43] i am the clay
[58:44] mold me and make me
[58:47] but sometimes it hurts
[58:50] the trials we go through
[58:52] the things that come our way
[58:55] we say oh lord please no don't let this
[58:57] sit oh god please no but he what does he
[58:59] do he's the potter
[59:01] trust in him
[59:03] whatever the trial trusts in him
[59:06] hold on amen

[1:01:41] as you see that they approaching
[1:01:43] as we and we're seeing it friends
[1:01:45] there's never been a day like this day
[1:01:49] if god would just open our eyes and we
[1:01:50] could see the day we're living in right
[1:01:52] now
[1:01:54] we see this right now
[1:01:56] there's a there's a potential uh uh
[1:02:00] uh thing of a world war taking place
[1:02:03] right now we have russia standing up
[1:02:05] right there and he is threatening the
[1:02:07] world with nuclear
[1:02:09] warfare
[1:02:11] and the and the nations are still
[1:02:12] pumping
[1:02:13] all these arms into ukraine even then
[1:02:17] and everybody's fearing you you could
[1:02:19] see the news that we're going to get
[1:02:21] dragged into a war
[1:02:24] we're at the end friend we don't know
[1:02:26] how it's going to come
[1:02:28] but with it when they shall say say
[1:02:30] peace and safety then sudden destruction
[1:02:32] cometh upon them as travail upon a woman
[1:02:35] and they shall not escape
[1:02:37] we're living in a hard time right now
[1:02:42] but he is a potter
[1:02:44] and we are the clay
[1:02:46] have not the powder power over the clay
[1:02:49] of the same lump to make one vessel unto
[1:02:51] water and another unto this honor what
[1:02:53] if god's willing to show his wrath
[1:02:56] and to make his power known endured with
[1:02:59] much longsuffering the vessels of wrath
[1:03:02] fitted to destruction
[1:03:05] hath not the potter power over the clay
[1:03:07] i was praying this morning and
[1:03:10] and as i began to pray for you for
[1:03:12] ukraine and even for those russian
[1:03:14] soldiers that
[1:03:15] if you've been reading the news they
[1:03:16] don't want to be there
[1:03:18] they're deserting they're they they're
[1:03:20] these young men they adam said that they
[1:03:23] caught prisoners that they weren't even
[1:03:25] even told what was going on that they
[1:03:27] were going into a war and these are
[1:03:30] young men 18 years old 20 years old
[1:03:35] and i don't know some there might be
[1:03:36] some of our brothers over there in that
[1:03:38] war in russia we have brethren in russia
[1:03:42] we have brethren in ukraine
[1:03:45] i heard a testimony that there was a
[1:03:47] family i believe it was a message family
[1:03:50] that were they were in their home and a
[1:03:52] missile
[1:03:53] a missile those things are big but
[1:03:56] besides the piano came crashing into
[1:03:58] their backyard
[1:04:00] i heard another story there was a family
[1:04:02] of eight or nine and they were praying
[1:04:04] in the living room
[1:04:06] and a missile came crashing through the
[1:04:08] through the uh
[1:04:10] the roof into the kitchen and there's a
[1:04:12] picture of that thing right there where
[1:04:14] the stove or whatever this thing and
[1:04:15] that big old missile right and didn't
[1:04:18] explode the one that fell in that
[1:04:19] backyard did not explode
[1:04:22] it would have taken the whole block
[1:04:24] let alone the house
[1:04:26] but i believe god is going to protect
[1:04:28] his people
[1:04:29] pray for them we don't know
[1:04:32] who you know the suffering that's going
[1:04:34] on over there it's unbelievable
[1:04:36] and i was praying i was saying lord and
[1:04:38] i thought about this evil man putin i
[1:04:40] thought lord
[1:04:41] why don't you destroy that man he's evil
[1:04:45] and if you ever read anything of the
[1:04:46] things he's done he's had people
[1:04:48] poisoned he's had people assassinated
[1:04:50] anybody they're afraid of they're so
[1:04:52] afraid of him that's why he's in power
[1:04:56] and he sends out he lets him know you
[1:04:58] you buck me and i'll kill you i'll have
[1:05:00] you killed he's had people shot in the
[1:05:03] streets he's had people poisoned
[1:05:06] he's a murderer
[1:05:08] and and he's a liar
[1:05:10] and he's he's holding on to power by
[1:05:13] fear
[1:05:15] and he's evil and i said lord take that
[1:05:18] man out
[1:05:19] destroy that evil in that nation
[1:05:22] but we know that in all of this
[1:05:24] god's his purpose is going to be
[1:05:26] fulfilled
[1:05:32] what if god willing to show his wrath
[1:05:35] to make his power known endured with
[1:05:36] much long suffering suffering the
[1:05:39] vessels of wrath
[1:05:41] putin is one of them
[1:05:43] fitted to destruction
[1:05:45] we know what his eternal destination is
[1:05:49] hath not the powder power of the clay
[1:05:51] of the same lump to make one vessel unto
[1:05:53] honor and another unto dishonor what if
[1:05:56] god's willing to show his wrath and to
[1:05:58] make his power known endured with much
[1:06:00] longsuffering the vessels of wrath
[1:06:02] fitted to destruction
[1:06:05] in isaiah
[1:06:06] 35 and
[1:06:08] 8
[1:06:09] it says in a highway
[1:06:12] shall there be
[1:06:14] and
[1:06:15] away
[1:06:17] a highway
[1:06:19] there shall be and away and it shall be
[1:06:21] called the way
[1:06:23] of holiness not the highway of holiness
[1:06:26] but the way
[1:06:27] of holiness
[1:06:29] the unclean shall not pass over it but
[1:06:32] it shall be for those the wayfaring men
[1:06:36] thou fools
[1:06:38] shall not error therein
[1:06:40] so we're walking
[1:06:42] up this of this way
[1:06:45] of holiness
[1:06:47] sometimes we can be a fool
[1:06:51] we can do stupid things
[1:06:53] but we're still not going to err
[1:06:56] god chose us
[1:06:58] the only reason we're on this way
[1:07:00] because god elected us
[1:07:03] otherwise we'd be on the other one
[1:07:05] we're going up it is hard it's not easy
[1:07:08] it's a struggle we have to strive what
[1:07:10] does thrive mean you fight
[1:07:13] you give it all you got you you you you
[1:07:16] push
[1:07:17] you you battle amen you put on the armor
[1:07:20] of god and you face that devil every day
[1:07:25] brother that was our in our church i
[1:07:26] don't think he knew brother dana
[1:07:27] thornhill but he he's in jail now
[1:07:31] and
[1:07:32] he's been writing to me ever since he
[1:07:33] went to jail and
[1:07:35] and we help him out with a monthly help
[1:07:37] of money to help him with his his needs
[1:07:40] but he's serving god in there
[1:07:42] and he's in his letters are coming to me
[1:07:44] just
[1:07:45] a life of he spends four or five hours
[1:07:48] in prayer reading his bible witnessing
[1:07:51] to everybody there
[1:07:53] just living for god
[1:07:54] and he believes that this is where this
[1:07:57] is where he needed to be
[1:07:59] and it was hard
[1:08:01] but that's where god has him
[1:08:03] he had a young man come to him tell and
[1:08:05] said and
[1:08:06] and argued with him because
[1:08:09] about about
[1:08:11] being holy before the lord is no i said
[1:08:13] we're god we're sinners we're going to
[1:08:14] sin just get used to it
[1:08:16] god's going to forgive you anyhow
[1:08:19] but it's not that way friends
[1:08:21] there's a holiness
[1:08:23] without holiness
[1:08:24] no man shall see god
[1:08:27] and this way
[1:08:29] the unclean
[1:08:31] shall not pass over it
[1:08:34] so we gotta fight that
[1:08:37] if we stop fighting them you know what
[1:08:38] this flesh is going to do
[1:08:40] it's going to backslide
[1:08:43] you realize we're always when it comes
[1:08:44] to the lord we're in continual motion at
[1:08:46] all times
[1:08:48] there's no standing still
[1:08:50] you're either moving forward
[1:08:52] or you're backing up
[1:08:54] you're backsliding
[1:08:56] either you're moving forward with god
[1:08:59] and hopefully
[1:09:01] in the way
[1:09:02] not in that one
[1:09:04] but walking up that
[1:09:06] that way
[1:09:08] fighting the battle every day
[1:09:10] fighting this whole flesh as i said
[1:09:12] before maybe i've said it here in all
[1:09:14] flesh don't want to serve god
[1:09:17] old flesh don't want to read his bible
[1:09:19] old flesh don't want to pray
[1:09:22] you know what you got to do you guys say
[1:09:23] flesh you're going to pray
[1:09:25] flesh you're going to church
[1:09:28] it's sunday morning you're going to
[1:09:29] church flesh don't want to go
[1:09:32] you know paul said i i i he talked about
[1:09:35] taking this flesh and putting it and
[1:09:37] subjecting it to the word of god
[1:09:40] i believe that's where he says lest i
[1:09:42] after after having preached the gospel i
[1:09:44] myself become a caster we
[1:09:47] we take this flesh and we subject it
[1:09:50] by the power of the holy spirit
[1:09:53] amen first we need the holy ghost
[1:09:56] but you can have the holy ghost and
[1:09:57] still be backsliding
[1:09:59] the holy ghost will take his flight
[1:10:01] you've got to get the holy ghost in you
[1:10:03] you got to start pressing the battle
[1:10:05] amen
[1:10:07] it's not an easy it's not an easy thing
[1:10:11] the lord spoke to me some time ago and
[1:10:14] i was thinking about all that as god's
[1:10:16] transpired the last few months in our
[1:10:17] life and where we're at right now my
[1:10:18] wife and i and what she's been through
[1:10:21] seven operations already in the last
[1:10:23] three years

[1:10:26] it's been very hard
[1:10:28] and the lord spoke to my heart
[1:10:31] and he said son i never said it would be
[1:10:32] easy
[1:10:35] and that stayed with me
[1:10:36] it strengthened me

[1:15:06] blessed are ye
[1:15:08] when men shall hate you
[1:15:10] and when men shall separate you from
[1:15:12] their company
[1:15:14] and shall reproach you
[1:15:17] and cast out your name as evil
[1:15:20] for the son of man's sake
[1:15:22] if you live your life wherever if you
[1:15:24] live this life at work at school
[1:15:28] wherever you go

[1:16:05] before it hated you

[1:16:10] proverbs 2 8
[1:16:12] he keepeth the paths of judgment
[1:16:15] and preserveth the way of his saints
[1:16:20] what's god doing he's preserving our way
[1:16:23] you know he made a way already he's a
[1:16:26] way maker is that right
[1:16:28] jesus is a waymaker he made a way he
[1:16:32] made a way for me
[1:16:34] amen we're walking on the footsteps in
[1:16:37] the footprints the bloody footprints of
[1:16:40] our lord who goes before us

[1:17:04] not everyone that saith unto me lord
[1:17:06] lord
[1:17:08] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven
[1:17:11] but he that doeth the will of my father
[1:17:14] which is in heaven
[1:17:16] remember many
[1:17:18] will seek to enter in
[1:17:20] jesus said
[1:17:22] many will say to me in that day
[1:17:25] lord lord have we not prophesied in your
[1:17:27] name
[1:17:28] you know prophesied brother says means
[1:17:30] preach
[1:17:33] have we not prophesied in your name and
[1:17:35] in thy name have cast out devils
[1:17:38] and in thy name done many wonderful
[1:17:40] works
[1:17:42] and then will i profess unto them
[1:17:44] i never knew you there was a man named
[1:17:46] todd something or other some years back
[1:17:49] came out out of canada tattoos all over
[1:17:52] him
[1:17:53] and this is evangelist
[1:17:57] and he hits people that come and he
[1:17:58] supposedly he prays for people and get
[1:18:00] healed
[1:18:01] he and i don't know if you've ever heard
[1:18:02] of this man but he'll he'll punch him in
[1:18:04] the in the gut or kick them or something
[1:18:06] like that
[1:18:08] something's wrong with that fella
[1:18:10] but you know people are being healed
[1:18:13] give god the glory
[1:18:15] not that man
[1:18:16] and i heard that he had had some
[1:18:19] revivals in florida
[1:18:21] and been going on for weeks have been
[1:18:22] many many many healed
[1:18:24] there was there was reports of the dead
[1:18:26] being raised i don't know about that but
[1:18:28] that's what they say
[1:18:30] and during that time that he he was
[1:18:32] having those revivals he was living in
[1:18:34] adultery with another woman
[1:18:37] many will say to me in that day lord
[1:18:39] lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[1:18:41] and in thy name cast out devils remember
[1:18:44] judas what did he do
[1:18:46] the son of perdition
[1:18:48] that the bible says it would have been
[1:18:49] better better had he not ever been born
[1:18:53] cast out devils
[1:18:56] and done many wonderful works
[1:18:58] and then when i professed it to them i
[1:19:00] never knew you
[1:19:02] depart for me
[1:19:03] he didn't work in equity
[1:19:07] in the messenger seal of god in 54
[1:19:09] brother brown says and they were given
[1:19:11] power to go out and preach the gospel
[1:19:13] and cast out devils and to heal the sick
[1:19:16] judas iscariot
[1:19:18] in matthew 10 was mentioned among them
[1:19:21] and they went out and cast out devils
[1:19:23] and preached the gospel in such a way
[1:19:25] till sinners repented and devils left
[1:19:29] and they come back rejoicing and
[1:19:31] shouting and having a big time like a
[1:19:35] little holiness camp meeting and judas
[1:19:37] was right there with him
[1:19:39] that's exactly right right along there
[1:19:41] with him

[1:28:01] and i'm going to quote close with this
[1:28:03] quote from brother branham and in the
[1:28:04] seven church ages
[1:28:06] he says the lord god almighty says i
[1:28:08] know
[1:28:11] there he is walking in the midst of his
[1:28:13] people
[1:28:15] you know the the seven golden
[1:28:17] candlesticks
[1:28:19] and he there he was walking among them
[1:28:21] as the son of god as as the whole
[1:28:23] brother mother man says it was the holy
[1:28:25] spirit throughout the ages
[1:28:27] as he walked
[1:28:29] even now we're with us because we're
[1:28:31] still this is still a lady you see in
[1:28:32] church age
[1:28:35] he said there he is a chief shepherd of
[1:28:36] the flock
[1:28:38] but does he hold back the
[1:28:40] persecution does he stem the tribulation
[1:28:45] no
[1:28:46] he does not
[1:28:48] he simply says
[1:28:51] i know
[1:28:53] and i'm so happy brother jordan sang
[1:28:55] that song
[1:28:56] he knows my name
[1:28:58] every step that i take
[1:29:01] every tear that he knows
[1:29:04] he knows what you're going every detail
[1:29:06] in your he knows hallelujah
[1:29:09] is i am not at all unmindful of your
[1:29:12] suffering
[1:29:14] what a stumbling block this is to so
[1:29:17] many people
[1:29:19] like israel they they wondered if god
[1:29:21] really loves him how can god be just and
[1:29:25] loving if he stands by and watches his
[1:29:28] people suffer
[1:29:29] see our thinking
[1:29:32] why would god why would god want me to
[1:29:34] suffer
[1:29:35] why would god not take this thorn in my
[1:29:38] flesh why would not god take this away
[1:29:40] from me right now no he he's trying to
[1:29:43] bring you through he's a potter you're
[1:29:45] the clay he's forming you he's making
[1:29:48] you and sometimes it hurts
[1:29:51] because but there is a purpose
[1:29:53] in your suffering
[1:29:55] there is a purpose if it wasn't for that
[1:29:57] where would you be
[1:30:00] if everything was well you're healthy
[1:30:02] everybody's healthy you got money in the
[1:30:03] bank you got a new car a new home you
[1:30:06] got this and everything is going your
[1:30:08] way will you ever think to even stop and
[1:30:10] pray and thought and thank god for
[1:30:11] anything we will get away from god we
[1:30:13] forget him
[1:30:15] but the problems of these things it
[1:30:17] keeps us
[1:30:18] just praying and seeking the lord
[1:30:21] amen it does something to our heart it
[1:30:23] changes us
[1:30:25] how can god be justified if he stands by
[1:30:28] and watches his people suffer what is
[1:30:30] that is what they ask in malachi 1 1-3
[1:30:34] the burden of the word of the lord to
[1:30:35] israel by malachi i have loved you saith
[1:30:38] the lord yet you say
[1:30:40] where it is thou love does they're
[1:30:41] telling god this where have you loved us
[1:30:45] was not esau jacob's brother
[1:30:47] saith the lord
[1:30:49] yet i loved jacob
[1:30:53] and hated esau
[1:30:55] and laid his mountains in his heritage
[1:30:57] waste for the dragons of the wilderness
[1:31:00] you see they could not figure out god's
[1:31:03] love they thought that love meant no
[1:31:06] suffering
[1:31:09] they thought that meant love love meant
[1:31:12] a baby with parental care
[1:31:16] have you ever watched a parent with a
[1:31:18] baby man they don't want to fly the land
[1:31:20] on his forehead
[1:31:22] that's parental care
[1:31:24] they're going to go out they're going to
[1:31:25] take them out and it's maybe 60 degree
[1:31:27] or they wrap him up more blankets and
[1:31:29] probably suffocate the kid more than
[1:31:30] anything else
[1:31:31] because they don't want they don't want
[1:31:32] him to suffer any cold at all
[1:31:35] that's parental care but god doesn't do
[1:31:37] that with us
[1:31:39] he wants to see men and women with
[1:31:41] backbone
[1:31:43] they'll face
[1:31:44] the the rugged sea amen they'll stand up
[1:31:47] for god
[1:31:48] they won't be ashamed of the gospel
[1:31:51] they will proclaim the gospel and
[1:31:53] believe with all their heart no matter
[1:31:54] what comes their way
[1:31:56] whether a thousand fall to the right ten
[1:31:58] thousand it doesn't matter the believer
[1:32:00] he hangs on
[1:32:02] amen
[1:32:06] parental care but god said that his love
[1:32:10] was elective love hallelujah back to
[1:32:13] that election again
[1:32:15] he elected you
[1:32:16] that's why he loves you
[1:32:18] lord but lord why am i so god do you
[1:32:20] love me lord are you done satan will
[1:32:22] come say he don't love you
[1:32:25] look at you look what you know what you
[1:32:26] did
[1:32:27] look how you act look how you say look
[1:32:29] looks temper flared up again he'll he
[1:32:31] don't care about you look what he did to
[1:32:33] you
[1:32:33] he took this away from you this one died
[1:32:36] and this happened this other happened he
[1:32:37] don't care for you
[1:32:40] no no no you don't don't fall back on
[1:32:41] that you fall back and wait a minute i
[1:32:43] know he loved me because he chose me
[1:32:47] amen
[1:32:48] i am a son of god
[1:32:51] for his many years are led by the spirit
[1:32:53] of god
[1:32:54] they are the sons of god
[1:32:56] for god has not given us a spirit of
[1:32:58] bondage again to fear but he's given us
[1:33:01] a spirit of adoption
[1:33:03] whereby we cry abba father we cry daddy
[1:33:07] hallelujah you're my heavenly father and
[1:33:10] i believe you lord i'm gonna hang on no
[1:33:13] matter what
[1:33:14] no matter what happened his love was
[1:33:16] proven truly by the fact that they were
[1:33:18] chosen
[1:33:20] unto salvation amen because god hath
[1:33:24] chosen you
[1:33:26] to salvation through sanctification of
[1:33:28] the spirit and belief in the truth
[1:33:31] he may commit you to death as he did
[1:33:33] paul he may commit you to suffering as
[1:33:36] he did job
[1:33:37] that is his prerogative
[1:33:40] he is sovereign
[1:33:42] but it is all with a purpose
[1:33:45] you know the unbeliever his house burns
[1:33:47] down and the believer his house burns
[1:33:50] down the believer his child dies
[1:33:54] the unbeliever his child dies so what's
[1:33:56] the difference
[1:33:57] the difference is that we as believers
[1:34:00] god is making us informing us
[1:34:02] and we stand there we're the only thing
[1:34:04] we're gonna take with us we're not
[1:34:06] taking our bank account if we have one
[1:34:08] we're not taking our beautiful car or
[1:34:10] our beautiful home no we're only taking
[1:34:12] our character
[1:34:14] that's what's with the essence of who
[1:34:16] you are that character
[1:34:19] that love that god has placed in your
[1:34:22] heart
[1:34:23] without perfect love you're not going to
[1:34:24] make it
[1:34:26] we've got to have that perfect love
[1:34:28] amen and that's the only thing that's
[1:34:30] going to go out of here with us is the
[1:34:33] character that he made in us while we
[1:34:35] were here upon the earth that came
[1:34:38] through manifold temptations and
[1:34:41] sufferings
[1:34:42] amen
[1:34:43] the things that you've suffered the the
[1:34:46] the tears that you've cried by yourself
[1:34:49] that nobody even knows
[1:34:51] the hurt that's in your heart
[1:34:53] god's taking that
[1:34:54] say you say you pray say lord take these
[1:34:57] sufferings lord and these things and
[1:35:00] mold my heart into a heart lord where
[1:35:03] you can write your word in me
[1:35:05] and i can believe every word with with
[1:35:08] my heart
[1:35:10] he may commit you as he did job
[1:35:13] that is his prerogative
[1:35:14] he is sovereign
[1:35:15] if he did not have a purpose then he
[1:35:18] would be the author of frustration
[1:35:20] and not of peace
[1:35:22] his purpose is that after we have
[1:35:24] suffered a while
[1:35:26] we would be made perfect
[1:35:29] amen
[1:35:30] be established strengthened and settled
[1:35:34] as job said he put strength in us
[1:35:37] you see he himself suffered he learned
[1:35:40] obedience
[1:35:42] by the things that he suffered
[1:35:45] he was actually made perfect by the
[1:35:48] things that he suffered hebrews 5 8 to
[1:35:50] dine though he was a son yet he learned
[1:35:54] he obedience by the things which he
[1:35:56] suffered and being made perfect he
[1:35:59] became the author of eternal salvation
[1:36:02] unto all them that obey him in plain
[1:36:06] language the very character of jesus was
[1:36:10] perfected
[1:36:11] by suffering
[1:36:13] that character
[1:36:15] to be like jesus
[1:36:19] to be like jesus
[1:36:22] on earth i long
[1:36:25] to be like him
[1:36:27] well are you ready to suffer
[1:36:30] amen
[1:36:32] when it comes your way
[1:36:34] just hang on to god
[1:36:36] let the holy spirit take that
[1:36:39] and it'll form you
[1:36:41] it'll bring that
[1:36:42] it's like brother brahma said god takes
[1:36:44] that flower and he crushes it
[1:36:47] like he did brother branham's life
[1:36:50] when he's lost his wife his little baby
[1:36:53] and all he went through
[1:36:55] many of his family members died
[1:36:57] he took that flower and he crushed it
[1:37:00] till the fragrance
[1:37:01] come out
[1:37:03] god will take you as a flower and
[1:37:05] sometimes he's got to crush you a little
[1:37:07] bit
[1:37:08] to bring out that fragrance
[1:37:11] amen that the holy ghost
[1:37:12] is doing something inside your life
[1:37:15] your heart's being formed your heart's
[1:37:17] being changed hallelujah
[1:37:20] your character is taking on the
[1:37:22] character of jesus christ
[1:37:26] you have to suffer he says unless we
[1:37:28] suffer
[1:37:30] we cannot reign with him
[1:37:32] we have to suffer to reign
[1:37:35] the reason for this is that character
[1:37:37] simply is never made
[1:37:39] without suffering
[1:37:42] character is a victory
[1:37:45] what what what statements
[1:37:47] tremendous statements are made here
[1:37:49] character is a victory
[1:37:52] not a gift
[1:37:54] hallelujah
[1:37:58] a man without character cannot reign
[1:38:02] because
[1:38:03] power of power apart from character
[1:38:06] is what
[1:38:08] satanic
[1:38:11] that's that vladimir putin no character
[1:38:15] he's got power he's got no character
[1:38:18] that's satanic that was hitler that was
[1:38:22] stalin all these men that are ruled
[1:38:25] saddam hussein
[1:38:26] were men with much power but they had no
[1:38:29] character and they were
[1:38:32] instruments of satan
[1:38:34] but we
[1:38:35] god wants to put power in our hands he's
[1:38:39] placed power in our hands
[1:38:42] i've given you power over over scorpions
[1:38:45] and serpents and over all the power of
[1:38:47] the enemy
[1:38:49] we are the sons of god this morning
[1:38:52] i've got a message on that maybe i'll
[1:38:54] preach that one day here
[1:38:56] we are the sons of god now are we the
[1:38:59] sons of god now we're gonna be the sons
[1:39:01] of god brother passes we are now the
[1:39:03] sons of god the power is there now
[1:39:07] but it takes character to wield that
[1:39:10] power
[1:39:12] but power without characters is it but
[1:39:14] power with character is fit to rule and
[1:39:17] says he wants us to share even his
[1:39:19] throne
[1:39:20] his throne on the same basis that he
[1:39:23] overcame and he sat down in his father's
[1:39:25] throne
[1:39:26] then we have to overcome to sit with him
[1:39:30] and the little temporary suffering we go
[1:39:32] through now is not worthy to be compared
[1:39:35] to the tremendous glory that will be
[1:39:38] revealed in us when he comes amen
[1:39:41] oh what treasures are laid up for those
[1:39:45] who are willing to enter into his
[1:39:47] kingdom
[1:39:48] through much tribulation
[1:39:52] remember it's ascending on that hard way
[1:39:56] not the easy way
[1:39:57] it's a way that we we need to put on the
[1:39:59] armor of god
[1:40:01] and if you read those little scriptures
[1:40:03] at the end it says praying always
[1:40:05] how do we armor up in our prayer
[1:40:08] that's where we armor up
[1:40:10] when you pray
[1:40:12] and you ask god you ask god for that
[1:40:14] strength you start asking god lord and
[1:40:17] give me that that strength to fight the
[1:40:19] devil give me the strength for the day
[1:40:21] give me the help me for this day help me
[1:40:24] bring me through this day lord don't
[1:40:25] worry about tomorrow get through this
[1:40:27] day
[1:40:29] get through this day tomorrow jesus said
[1:40:31] has evils of his own
[1:40:34] sufficient unto the day is the evil
[1:40:36] thereof amen get through this day one
[1:40:39] day at a time sweet jesus
[1:40:42] and pray and say lord
[1:40:44] put the arm around me let me armor up
[1:40:46] father it's the armor is a is a is a
[1:40:49] spiritual armor that we put on
[1:40:52] he said think about strange concerning
[1:40:54] the fury of fiery trials that are to try
[1:40:57] you that is what peter said it is is it
[1:40:59] strange that god wants us to develop a
[1:41:02] christ-like character that comes through
[1:41:04] suffering no sir
[1:41:06] we all have trials we have all we are
[1:41:09] all tried and is chasing the sons not
[1:41:11] one but goes through that the church is
[1:41:14] not is not suff that is not suffering
[1:41:17] and is not being tried hasn't got it it
[1:41:20] isn't of god
[1:41:22] wow
[1:41:24] you see what you've been through with
[1:41:25] the church
[1:41:27] do you see that he says the church is
[1:41:29] not suffering is not of god
[1:41:33] hebrews 12 6 through 8 for whom the lord
[1:41:36] loveth he chasteneth
[1:41:38] and scourges every son who he whom he
[1:41:41] receiveth but he if he be without
[1:41:43] chastisement we're of all are partakers
[1:41:46] then you are bastards and not sons
[1:41:49] now this special condition of smyrna
[1:41:51] must be applied to every age
[1:41:54] there is no age free from it
[1:41:57] there is no true believer free from it
[1:42:01] what suffering
[1:42:03] this is of god
[1:42:06] this is the will of god
[1:42:08] it is needful
[1:42:11] we need the lord to teach us the truth
[1:42:14] that we are to suffer and be
[1:42:16] christ-light in doing it
[1:42:18] love
[1:42:19] suffereth long and his kind
[1:42:22] matthew 5 11-12
[1:42:25] blessed are ye when men shall revile you
[1:42:27] can persecute you and shall say o man or
[1:42:29] evil against you falsely for my sake
[1:42:31] rejoice and be exceeding glad for great
[1:42:34] is your reward in heaven for so
[1:42:36] persecuted they the prophets which were
[1:42:39] before you
[1:42:40] the cloudy skies almost done
[1:42:43] and storms of life
[1:42:45] listen to this
[1:42:46] the cloudy skies
[1:42:48] and storms of life are no signs of god's
[1:42:52] disapproval
[1:42:55] neither are bright skies and still
[1:42:57] waters
[1:42:58] signs of his love and approval
[1:43:02] his approval of any of us is only in the
[1:43:07] beloved
[1:43:08] his love is elective which he had for us
[1:43:13] before the foundation of the world
[1:43:16] hallelujah
[1:43:18] amen
[1:43:19] does he love us ah yes
[1:43:22] yes does he love you
[1:43:24] does do you think do you believe he
[1:43:26] loves you
[1:43:27] amen but how shall we know
[1:43:30] he asks a question how shall we know
[1:43:33] how can i know lord that you love me
[1:43:35] look what i'm going through lord look
[1:43:36] all of suffering oh god how can i know
[1:43:40] we shall know
[1:43:41] because
[1:43:43] he
[1:43:44] said so
[1:43:45] hallelujah
[1:43:47] he said it i believe it amen
[1:43:50] and manifested that he did love us for
[1:43:53] he brought us to himself
[1:43:55] and gave us of his spirit
[1:43:57] placing us as sons and how shall i prove
[1:44:01] my love to him
[1:44:03] by believing
[1:44:04] what he said
[1:44:06] and conducting myself
[1:44:08] with joy
[1:44:10] amidst the trials that he and his wisdom
[1:44:13] allows to come to pass
[1:44:16] amen
[1:44:17] that's what god's it's his will
[1:44:20] amen
[1:44:21] it was in his life
[1:44:24] he didn't even spare himself
[1:44:27] and he look what he look what he went
[1:44:28] through he was despised he was rejected
[1:44:32] of gol reads isaiah
[1:44:34] and they're in the psalms where he talks
[1:44:36] how he was despised and rejected and
[1:44:39] hated
[1:44:40] of all men
[1:44:42] he suffered like no human being had ever
[1:44:45] suffered
[1:44:47] because he had that love
[1:44:49] amen
[1:44:50] that such love
[1:44:52] that he even when they were
[1:44:55] hammering nails into his flesh
[1:44:58] he could say father forgive
[1:45:00] them oh he not he didn't revile back
[1:45:03] when he spit in his face and yanked the
[1:45:06] beard out of his face
[1:45:07] when he smote him with that with that
[1:45:10] with that whip and yanked the flesh off
[1:45:12] his back
[1:45:13] and the blood just flew bled out of him
[1:45:18] i believe there was more blood god had
[1:45:20] to produce blood in his body so he could
[1:45:22] bleed more
[1:45:24] i believe there was something going on
[1:45:26] supernaturalness in his body that was
[1:45:28] producing more blood just so it could
[1:45:30] bleed out
[1:45:31] he bled when they struck him with a whip
[1:45:34] tore all the flesh off his back
[1:45:36] they pulled the beard just put the crown
[1:45:38] of thorns on his forehead and smashed it
[1:45:41] down into the bone of his skull and the
[1:45:43] blood just came down his face
[1:45:46] they smote him with a rod they struck
[1:45:48] him
[1:45:50] and then they hung him on a cross
[1:45:52] and they put a spear in the side
[1:45:55] where did all that blood come from blood
[1:45:58] all over everything
[1:45:59] my mind
[1:46:01] and that's what the life he lived

[1:50:53] and
[1:50:56] we were at the airport in cleveland and
[1:50:57] we're coming down a
[1:51:00] short
[1:51:01] escalator
[1:51:02] and i should have taken the
[1:51:04] the elevator because of my wife but
[1:51:06] she'd been doing okay on the escalators
[1:51:08] so we're coming down to go get our
[1:51:10] baggage claim
[1:51:11] it was a short one and she and i got on
[1:51:14] and then she got on she put one foot on
[1:51:17] and the other foot wasn't quick enough
[1:51:19] and that thing just made her do a split
[1:51:21] there on the and she fell on the
[1:51:23] escalator
[1:51:24] so i hear i'm going back up
[1:51:26] while the thing is coming down to help
[1:51:29] her
[1:51:29] and i had a backpack on my back
[1:51:32] i'm trying to pull her up and she's
[1:51:33] pulling on me and also the weight of the
[1:51:36] backpack it made me fall back on the
[1:51:38] escalator itself and so here we are we
[1:51:41] hit the bottom and the escalator is
[1:51:43] moving underneath us and i can't get up
[1:51:45] that backpack is holding me
[1:51:47] and i can't i couldn't grab anything
[1:51:49] but i think a lot when i fell i pulled
[1:51:51] something because
[1:51:53] later on while i was there in
[1:51:54] pennsylvania i started feeling the pain
[1:51:56] in my shoulder
[1:51:58] it's gradually gotten worse finally we
[1:52:00] had an mri done and they found a
[1:52:03] wrote a rotator cuff tear
[1:52:06] in the shoulder left shoulder
[1:52:08] and it is very painful
[1:52:10] as a matter of fact uh
[1:52:12] i i can't even just turn on this little
[1:52:14] thing here in my side
[1:52:16] i had puts my shoulder in a certain
[1:52:18] position and it becomes very painful
[1:52:21] and
