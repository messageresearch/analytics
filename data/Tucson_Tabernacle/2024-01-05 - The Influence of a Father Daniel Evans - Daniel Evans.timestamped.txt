[21:35] play the soprano play the tenor I like
[21:37] that one better
[21:38] I appreciated her very much and I'd like
[21:40] to sing two songs today

[21:45] the first one being Zion's Hill there
[21:48] waits for me I'll glad tomorrow

[58:24] fellowship that I got with the brothers
[58:28] um just it's just a good spirit a lot of
[58:30] fun good people good good Fellowship
[58:34] I um I wanted to talk this morning
[58:38] about Father's Day and about dads
[58:42] and um what's going on in the world
[58:45] today there's there's a definite agenda
[58:49] in the world and it's and we see here in
[58:52] the United States that it's really it's
[58:53] a liberal agenda
[58:55] that
[58:57] it's it's trying to remove the parents
[59:01] from the family and and make these kids
[59:06] have them have the state have the
[59:08] government make the decisions in raising
[59:10] them
[59:11] and and it's you see that our boys are
[59:15] taught in school
[59:16] that they're privileged and and they
[59:18] should they should give way to to the
[59:20] less qualified or or they should always
[59:22] take a back seat and they should lose in
[59:24] everything that they do
[59:26] and it's it's being taught in our
[59:28] schools it's being taught in our even in
[59:32] certain congregations it's it's just
[59:34] being taught in the culture
[59:36] of America
[59:38] and what it's doing is it's producing a
[59:41] generation
[59:44] of males of young men who are confused
[59:48] they're ambivalent they're uncertain
[59:50] about things
[59:52] they lack self-esteem and they just
[59:55] simply don't care
[59:57] and we see it we see it on the streets
[1:00:00] we see everywhere we see all of these
[1:00:04] strung out many of these young men
[1:00:07] homeless on drugs
[1:00:10] and if you've been on this Earth very
[1:00:13] long you can see it's never been like
[1:00:15] this in the history of this country
[1:00:18] and they're everywhere
[1:00:20] and they're being taught young men you
[1:00:22] don't have to work you don't have to
[1:00:24] earn a living for your family you don't
[1:00:26] have to be a man
[1:00:30] in life
[1:00:32] you just sit back let the government
[1:00:34] support you or let somebody else support
[1:00:36] you and just do whatever you want and
[1:00:39] other people
[1:00:42] should should be doing all of all of the
[1:00:46] the work and Society are making all the
[1:00:48] money but but you don't have to do
[1:00:50] anything just sit back
[1:00:52] and
[1:00:54] and be
[1:00:57] really be a coward
[1:01:00] and that's what that's what this
[1:01:02] generation is being taught they're being
[1:01:05] taught it everywhere being taught on
[1:01:06] television they're being taught this in
[1:01:07] the schools they're being taught by
[1:01:09] their culture that's forming in our
[1:01:11] society and you see there are a few men
[1:01:15] that will stand up against the
[1:01:18] establishment and look what happens to
[1:01:20] them
[1:01:21] when there's a man named Tucker Carlson
[1:01:23] many of you know him very popular
[1:01:25] newscaster
[1:01:27] stood up Against The Establishment got
[1:01:31] fired for it
[1:01:33] now I don't know I don't know if he's a
[1:01:35] Christian I don't know much about his
[1:01:36] personal life but I do know that that
[1:01:38] man is a man
[1:01:40] he's somebody that will stand up and the
[1:01:43] reason that he is hated
[1:01:45] is because he doesn't cave to the
[1:01:47] establishment
[1:01:48] is because he is willing to speak what
[1:01:52] he thinks is the truth and he does speak
[1:01:53] the truth he's a good man
[1:01:56] you see that that there's there's other
[1:01:59] people in society that this isn't a
[1:02:02] political speech by the way I'm not I'm
[1:02:03] not up here trying to to root for
[1:02:06] conservatives or root for for liberals
[1:02:09] but I am saying it's it's what is in our
[1:02:11] world today
[1:02:13] we see Donald Trump everybody knows
[1:02:15] Donald Trump I'm not a fan
[1:02:17] of Donald Trump I don't like the way he
[1:02:19] does things he uh he checks a few of the
[1:02:22] boxes in in second Timothy 3 that says
[1:02:25] that for men shall be lovers of their
[1:02:27] own selves comforters boasters proud
[1:02:29] blasphemers incontinent and fierce he
[1:02:32] does check a few of those boxes but he's
[1:02:34] a man
[1:02:36] and one thing I do appreciate about him
[1:02:38] is he is willing to stand up for what he
[1:02:41] thinks is right
[1:02:43] and looks what look what's happened to
[1:02:45] him recently
[1:02:46] he's been arrested
[1:02:48] on these Petty charges
[1:02:50] that really there are things that all of
[1:02:53] the presidents have done and yet they
[1:02:55] single him out why because he stands up
[1:02:58] against the establishment he's a real
[1:03:01] man
[1:03:03] that doesn't as I said I'm not
[1:03:04] advocating for him
[1:03:06] but I do appreciate
[1:03:08] that he's willing to make a stand
[1:03:12] he's
[1:03:13] the thing about that man that they hate
[1:03:16] the most is he believes in Freedom
[1:03:20] and he's willing
[1:03:22] to do whatever it takes to have this
[1:03:25] freedom
[1:03:26] and we see that that is what is
[1:03:29] happening in this country they are
[1:03:31] trying to take away the freedom of the
[1:03:34] people
[1:03:37] and people won't stand they won't stand
[1:03:39] up for it
[1:03:40] they won't they won't
[1:03:43] make a stand for what is right they tell
[1:03:46] us to wear these ridiculous masks
[1:03:49] all the time you know and I know that
[1:03:53] covert was here but they they they
[1:03:56] present this thing as as a fear tactic
[1:04:02] and they take they use it to take away
[1:04:05] our freedoms
[1:04:07] so much so that you can't go outside of
[1:04:10] your house you can't go to work they
[1:04:12] make you inject some chemicals you don't
[1:04:14] know what it is and force you to do it
[1:04:16] or you get fired
[1:04:19] or you get kicked out
[1:04:22] if you're a police police officer
[1:04:25] or you get kicked out of the military
[1:04:27] there's a couple families in here
[1:04:29] represented by that
[1:04:31] forcing them
[1:04:33] to do this and they do it with fear
[1:04:37] and what a masterful plan that Satan has
[1:04:41] engineered
[1:04:42] he killed millions of people
[1:04:45] with this incredibly contagious disease
[1:04:50] and he made the disease weak enough
[1:04:53] that most people just experience minor
[1:04:55] symptoms but it left a fear in the world
[1:05:02] and people gave up their rights as I
[1:05:05] said
[1:05:05] they gave up their rights for their
[1:05:07] health care they gave up their rights to
[1:05:09] to go to work they gave up their rights
[1:05:11] to even worship freely in church
[1:05:18] and I and as I said that people were
[1:05:20] kicked out of the military they were
[1:05:22] they were kicked out of the police
[1:05:24] department and then we see even pastors
[1:05:27] not willing to make a stand
[1:05:30] so afraid
[1:05:32] of this disease and I wonder I wonder
[1:05:34] how many Souls were lost
[1:05:38] because of this this pandemic versus how
[1:05:42] many lives were lost
[1:05:44] we went into this thing in in one sense
[1:05:47] and then we come out and we are a
[1:05:49] totally different country coming out
[1:05:51] and we have all these laws and
[1:05:53] regulations and the churches are about
[1:05:56] half of what they used to be
[1:05:59] because the people got used to staying
[1:06:02] home not wanting to go to church not not
[1:06:06] coming in exactly what the devil's plan
[1:06:09] was he was a master in what he did
[1:06:12] and he brought the people away from
[1:06:15] church and now they got into the bad
[1:06:17] habits and they don't want to come in
[1:06:18] and then there's a few pastors that we
[1:06:21] see out there that stood up against the
[1:06:24] establishment
[1:06:25] especially in Canada they came down
[1:06:27] harder on the people in Canada than they
[1:06:29] did here we have that those Pastors in
[1:06:32] Canada they were willing to be arrested
[1:06:35] for not preventing the people from
[1:06:38] coming together in worship and they they
[1:06:40] did get arrested for it went to jail for
[1:06:42] it
[1:06:43] and we think we live in a free society
[1:06:46] and look what's happened
[1:06:48] it's a scary thing
[1:06:51] there's a man that as I was as I was
[1:06:53] researching some of this a couple months
[1:06:55] ago there was a Canadian Pastor in
[1:06:56] Calgary called Derek reamer brimer
[1:07:01] he protested drag queen Story Hour
[1:07:06] for children in the public library
[1:07:09] he protested it
[1:07:12] he went out and said it is wrong for
[1:07:14] these perverts to be reading stories to
[1:07:16] our children dressed in the way that
[1:07:18] they were dressed dressed up like women
[1:07:20] he made a stand
[1:07:23] and he was arrested for it
[1:07:27] they they couldn't figure out
[1:07:29] being on public property they couldn't
[1:07:31] figure out something to charge him with
[1:07:33] so they charged him with hate crimes
[1:07:36] against the LGBT community
[1:07:38] because he protested how ridiculous
[1:07:42] but that's the world that we live in
[1:07:45] they're against they're against the
[1:07:47] police officers they're against anything
[1:07:49] that anything that is good
[1:07:53] but don't challenge let them protest all
[1:07:56] they want let them protest masculinity
[1:07:59] let them protest the American man let
[1:08:01] them protest hard work let them protest
[1:08:04] these things but if you try to protest
[1:08:07] against that filth that they're shoving
[1:08:09] down our throats you're going to be
[1:08:11] arrested for it and we live in a free
[1:08:12] country
[1:08:14] huh
[1:08:15] our freedoms are quickly leaving friends
[1:08:18] and like I said this isn't some
[1:08:19] political speech I'm just saying this is
[1:08:22] what's going on around us
[1:08:24] it was prophesied to happen
[1:08:27] and now we're seeing it it shouldn't be
[1:08:29] a surprise
[1:08:33] and I think it's the same in the
[1:08:34] ministry
[1:08:36] you know we look at the churches and we
[1:08:39] see that that so often the pulpit is
[1:08:42] controlled by the status quo it's
[1:08:45] controlled by the establishment you're
[1:08:47] only permitted to preach certain things
[1:08:49] and you have to preach it this way
[1:08:53] or they'll come against you
[1:08:56] the people will come against you they'll
[1:08:58] start murmuring among themselves and
[1:09:01] they're they'll come to you and they'll
[1:09:02] say well if you don't preach it like
[1:09:04] this
[1:09:07] then
[1:09:09] we're just going to leave
[1:09:12] oh we're gonna we're gonna take our as
[1:09:14] brother Brandon said we're gonna give me
[1:09:16] my uh letter and I'll just take it to
[1:09:18] another church as the denomination say
[1:09:21] and we see it so plainly today in the
[1:09:24] churches that there is no boldness from
[1:09:27] the pulpit to preach what is right even
[1:09:31] if it disagrees with the status quo
[1:09:36] second Timothy chapter 4 says this this
[1:09:39] is Paul instructing his Protege Timothy
[1:09:42] he says preach the word be instant in
[1:09:45] season out of season reprove rebuke
[1:09:47] exhort with all long-suffering and
[1:09:50] Doctrine for the time will come well
[1:09:51] they will not endure sound Doctrine
[1:09:54] the time will come when they will not
[1:09:57] endure sound Doctrine
[1:10:01] but after their own lusts
[1:10:03] after their own desires
[1:10:06] this is not taught this is talking about
[1:10:09] the congregations of the world the
[1:10:11] Christianity of the world after their
[1:10:14] own desires they will Heap
[1:10:17] for themselves teachers
[1:10:20] so they're going to put these teachers
[1:10:22] up there and these people are having
[1:10:24] itching ears because they're going to
[1:10:26] put up the ones they're gonna they want
[1:10:28] to hear a certain thing
[1:10:32] and if they don't hear that thing
[1:10:35] then they get offended and they have
[1:10:38] they have problems with it and we see
[1:10:40] that very scripture fulfilled today and
[1:10:43] then it says and they shall turn their
[1:10:45] away their ears from the truth and be
[1:10:48] turned to Fables
[1:10:50] believing things that aren't real
[1:10:54] we see that very scripture again
[1:10:56] fulfilled
[1:10:58] in this day
[1:11:01] it's the same
[1:11:04] I'll say it the the so-called message
[1:11:07] that we believe that that so often
[1:11:10] presented to us is so far off of what
[1:11:13] the prophet spoke that it doesn't even
[1:11:15] resemble it many in many places
[1:11:19] it's the truth
[1:11:23] and we see the world the same way this
[1:11:26] country this United States it's gotten
[1:11:28] so far off of what our founding fathers
[1:11:32] what they intended
[1:11:34] that it doesn't even resemble the United
[1:11:36] States they they would come here and
[1:11:38] they would be like what are you talking
[1:11:40] about
[1:11:41] we set this constitution in order and
[1:11:44] this is what you've done with it
[1:11:49] and the biggest enemy
[1:11:52] this is the devil's agenda everywhere
[1:11:55] and the biggest enemy
[1:11:57] of the devil's agenda today both in
[1:12:00] society
[1:12:02] and in church
[1:12:04] is the American father
[1:12:09] he is the most he is the biggest
[1:12:14] adversary
[1:12:15] and the devil can in the devil getting
[1:12:18] his agenda across he is the biggest
[1:12:22] adversary that he's faced and that's why
[1:12:24] you see it in the government that's why
[1:12:26] you see it in communities that's why you
[1:12:29] see that attack
[1:12:30] on parenting and fatherhood
[1:12:33] is because the enemy knows you get that
[1:12:36] Dad out of the way
[1:12:38] and I got it
[1:12:42] I found
[1:12:46] I think about
[1:12:48] how
[1:12:50] it's the demasculinization
[1:12:53] of the American man make him weak make
[1:12:56] him a coward make him afraid to stand up
[1:12:58] for for what's right
[1:13:00] and that's what we see we see it
[1:13:02] everywhere everybody's apologizing oh
[1:13:04] I'm sorry for for being a Christian I'm
[1:13:06] sorry for I'm sorry for for standing
[1:13:08] against something that the Bible teaches
[1:13:10] against
[1:13:13] if the Bible teaches against it why can
[1:13:15] we not stand for it
[1:13:19] I look at I think about Caleb 80 years I
[1:13:21] think about Caleb at 80 years old Caleb
[1:13:23] and Joshua they went over Jordan Caleb
[1:13:26] is an old man they're there for a while
[1:13:28] and there's this mountain that Caleb
[1:13:30] knew was his inheritance that God had
[1:13:32] given him
[1:13:35] he sees this mountain it's full of
[1:13:36] giants it's full of Warriors 80 year old
[1:13:39] man
[1:13:41] he goes to Joshua
[1:13:43] he says
[1:13:45] oh that's my mountain
[1:13:48] he says I'm a better man now at 80 years
[1:13:51] old than I was 40 years ago he says I'll
[1:13:54] go take it and you know what he did
[1:13:58] he was a man
[1:14:00] you look at Noah Noah and the Ark
[1:14:03] there's all the filth that was in the
[1:14:06] world Noah found Grace in the eyes of
[1:14:08] Lord he stood up against it and he said
[1:14:10] I'm gonna build this Ark no matter how
[1:14:13] bad that they made fun of him and all
[1:14:14] all that they did against him and Noah
[1:14:17] stood firm on on God's leading
[1:14:20] and his family was the only one saved in
[1:14:25] the entire world
[1:14:26] was Noah because that Daddy stood for
[1:14:30] what was right
[1:14:32] but how do you do it
[1:14:34] Romans 8 31 says this what shall we what
[1:14:38] shall then we say to these things
[1:14:41] and then he says this if God be with us
[1:14:43] if God before us who can be against us
[1:14:47] we look at these Servants of the Lord
[1:14:49] and he is still God but he's waiting for
[1:14:52] somebody that will stand up and have
[1:14:54] some courage to go against these things
[1:14:57] I was watching this video
[1:15:00] the other day of
[1:15:01] I like watching Wildlife I enjoyed
[1:15:05] um God's creation
[1:15:07] and I saw that they had on the video
[1:15:10] that there was this lioness I think it
[1:15:12] is one or two lionesses and there was
[1:15:14] all of these hyenas
[1:15:16] and they were surrounded there's like 50
[1:15:18] of them and they were surrounding this
[1:15:20] lioness and they would run up and they'd
[1:15:23] bite her
[1:15:24] and she'd turn around she'd take a swipe
[1:15:26] at them and then another one coming bite
[1:15:28] her
[1:15:28] and here they are they're about to kill
[1:15:30] this this female lion
[1:15:33] biting her a little bit and they were
[1:15:35] just trying to get into the soft spot
[1:15:36] and the belly so they could so they
[1:15:38] could rip and disembowel her
[1:15:41] and and she's sitting there and she's
[1:15:43] growling and she's fighting she's doing
[1:15:45] everything she can and then something
[1:15:47] happened
[1:15:49] on the video they panned and here it
[1:15:51] comes out of the bushes you see the big
[1:15:54] male lion and man his eyes were set you
[1:15:58] talk about scary eyes
[1:16:01] you look at a male lion he was running
[1:16:05] and he was focused and here comes Mufasa
[1:16:08] out of the out of the uh did I do it
[1:16:11] again Amos I did sorry
[1:16:15] here he comes out of the woods Amos gets
[1:16:19] on me for quoting some things that I
[1:16:22] shouldn't sometimes but Here Comes This
[1:16:25] lion out of the bushes and he makes a
[1:16:28] beeline and he knew exactly which one to
[1:16:30] go after with all these hyenas running
[1:16:32] everywhere like scared rabbits now he
[1:16:34] comes out and he hits full blast after
[1:16:37] burner's on he's going and they had slow
[1:16:40] motion here he is and he picks out one
[1:16:43] hyena
[1:16:44] and that hyena was what's called The
[1:16:46] Matriarch
[1:16:47] she was the leader of the whole group
[1:16:51] and he's running after her and and she's
[1:16:54] she's cooking as fast as she can go
[1:16:56] because she knows that those teeth are
[1:16:58] big behind her and here he comes and and
[1:17:02] they have it in slow motion and he
[1:17:03] reaches out with his claw and just with
[1:17:06] the tip of his claw he gr Just Clips her
[1:17:10] back leg
[1:17:13] and she turns around he has her she
[1:17:16] turns around he opens his mouth and
[1:17:19] crunch right on top of her head and
[1:17:22] Jezebel was dead man right there
[1:17:26] that was it that was over
[1:17:30] the attack on his family was finished
[1:17:34] and I think about that lion and I think
[1:17:37] about the courage that he had to go
[1:17:40] right into that and I said Lord where is
[1:17:42] that courage today among our brother
[1:17:45] where is it
[1:17:49] it's in the Holy Spirit is where it's at
[1:17:53] as I said
[1:17:55] the the person that is in the sights
[1:17:59] of Satan today
[1:18:01] is Dad
[1:18:03] he's going after him in every way that
[1:18:05] he can
[1:18:07] I found some stats on a website called
[1:18:10] nickcady.org
[1:18:12] he's a Christian blogger I wanted to
[1:18:14] share some of these these stats with you
[1:18:17] because I I think that they'll
[1:18:19] make you think
[1:18:21] about how important dad is in the family
[1:18:25] Father's Day
[1:18:26] is the lowest attended church day of the
[1:18:29] year
[1:18:32] wow
[1:18:34] Mother's Day is the third highest
[1:18:36] attended church day of the year next to
[1:18:39] Easter and Christmas
[1:18:42] this uh this guy says this
[1:18:46] this guy's name was on this website I
[1:18:48] found this they quoted this guy Scott
[1:18:49] McConnell of Life LifeWay research he
[1:18:52] says clearly
[1:18:54] mothers want to be present for the at
[1:18:56] present for the affirmation that is
[1:18:58] typically offered in most churches but
[1:19:01] families also are present knowing their
[1:19:03] attendance will be will honor their
[1:19:05] mother
[1:19:07] the attendance different difference
[1:19:09] between Mother's Day and Father's Day is
[1:19:12] telling
[1:19:13] either churches are less effective in
[1:19:16] affirming fathers
[1:19:17] or family believe families Believe
[1:19:19] Christian fathers don't value their
[1:19:22] participation in worship services
[1:19:25] that's where the American father is
[1:19:28] today
[1:19:31] for new converts a survey found that if
[1:19:34] a child is the first person in a
[1:19:36] household to become a Christian
[1:19:39] there is a 3.5 percent probability
[1:19:41] everyone else in the household will
[1:19:43] father follow
[1:19:44] 3.5 percent three and a half out of a
[1:19:47] hundred
[1:19:48] If the child becomes a Christian first
[1:19:51] if the mother is the first to become a
[1:19:54] Christian there is a 17 percent
[1:19:57] probability that everyone else in the
[1:19:59] household will follow follow
[1:20:02] however
[1:20:04] when the father is the first
[1:20:07] there is a 93
[1:20:10] probability that everyone in the
[1:20:12] household will follow
[1:20:13] wow
[1:20:15] look at how important a father is
[1:20:20] a father who regularly attends church
[1:20:22] even if the mother does not 66 percent
[1:20:26] of the children will attend church when
[1:20:28] they become adults
[1:20:29] when both parents attorney when both
[1:20:32] parents attend church 75
[1:20:34] percent of children will become regular
[1:20:37] worshipers
[1:20:41] 63 percent of suicides come from a
[1:20:45] father fatherless home
[1:20:48] 71 percent of high school dropouts come
[1:20:51] from fatherless homes
[1:20:53] 75 percent of youths in chemical abuse
[1:20:56] centers come from fatherless homes
[1:20:58] 80 percent of rapists come from
[1:21:02] fatherless homes
[1:21:05] 85 percent of Youth in prison come from
[1:21:07] fatherless homes 85 percent of children
[1:21:10] with behavioral disorders come from
[1:21:12] fatherless homes and 90 of homeless and
[1:21:15] runaway children come from fatherless
[1:21:17] homes why does the devil brother Dan why
[1:21:19] is the devil hate dad so much
[1:21:22] because of their influence
[1:21:26] and we look at the direction of the
[1:21:28] world we see that that Society is
[1:21:30] constantly mocking manhood and
[1:21:34] fatherhood
[1:21:35] we had a men's meeting the other day
[1:21:38] and I believe it was the Lord's will
[1:21:41] that we had it we had a good
[1:21:43] conversation it it blessed me in doing
[1:21:46] that and and I want to see this continue
[1:21:49] with the brothers in this church
[1:21:51] because the horsepower
[1:21:54] Mufasa
[1:21:55] the lion
[1:21:58] is powerful
[1:22:00] dad
[1:22:02] has Authority dad can do it
[1:22:05] and I want to see these brothers
[1:22:07] get some things done Brothers in this
[1:22:11] church
[1:22:12] I don't want a group of men that just
[1:22:14] comes together and talks about it I want
[1:22:16] to see action
[1:22:19] and we've got it
[1:22:21] we can do it but Andy we've got it
[1:22:24] brother we've we've got the brothers
[1:22:26] that that have the they they have the
[1:22:30] history they have the um
[1:22:33] ability
[1:22:34] now we just gotta move forward and do it
[1:22:38] when God was walking through the Garden
[1:22:42] of Eden
[1:22:46] and his children had fallen into sin
[1:22:52] he
[1:22:54] God knew what had happened he was God he
[1:22:56] knows everything
[1:22:58] and here he is walking through he didn't
[1:23:01] say
[1:23:02] Eve where are you
[1:23:05] he didn't say serpent where are you
[1:23:08] he said Adam
[1:23:10] where are you
[1:23:13] you are the head of your house what has
[1:23:17] happened here
[1:23:19] the accountability Came Upon
[1:23:23] dad
[1:23:26] dad needs to create an atmosphere
[1:23:31] around him
[1:23:32] we need to put the word first in our
[1:23:35] families
[1:23:37] and if we hear dad and he's he's the
[1:23:41] family is sitting around the supper
[1:23:43] table or in the living room and they're
[1:23:45] talking and they're putting people down
[1:23:47] they're gossiping about each other
[1:23:49] they're they're saying negative things
[1:23:51] and negative thoughts are coming out in
[1:23:53] the family's home
[1:23:55] in 20 years
[1:23:58] our children are going to be doing the
[1:23:59] same thing
[1:24:01] talking about the same stuff as we were
[1:24:05] because the the children learn
[1:24:08] from the adults they learn from what we
[1:24:11] say both fathers and mothers
[1:24:14] and then they will turn in to whatever
[1:24:17] we were unless that cycle
[1:24:21] breaks
[1:24:23] I want to share
[1:24:25] a scripture that meant a lot to me
[1:24:28] a few years ago because I didn't
[1:24:30] understand it let's turn to Exodus
[1:24:32] chapter 34.
[1:24:40] we'll start with verse six
[1:24:43] Exodus 34 yeah 6.
[1:24:48] now this is what happened Moses was up
[1:24:50] on the mountain he had broken the first
[1:24:51] tablets of stone he got angry and then
[1:24:54] God gives him God prepares another
[1:24:57] um tablet a set of tablets of stone for
[1:24:59] the Ten Commandments and he says here
[1:25:01] take these and that so that's the
[1:25:03] situation we have Moses up on the
[1:25:05] mountain
[1:25:06] and the Lord passed by before him
[1:25:09] and proclaimed the Lord the Lord God
[1:25:12] merciful and gracious long-suffering and
[1:25:16] abundant in goodness and Truth keeping
[1:25:18] mercies for thousands for giving
[1:25:20] iniquity and transgression and sin
[1:25:23] and that will by no means clear the
[1:25:26] guilty visiting the iniquity of the
[1:25:29] fathers upon the children
[1:25:31] and upon the children's children unto
[1:25:34] the third and fourth generation
[1:25:38] and Moses made haste and bowed his head
[1:25:40] toward the Earth and worshiped and he
[1:25:42] said
[1:25:43] if now I have found Grace in thy sight O
[1:25:46] Lord let let my Lord I pray thee go
[1:25:49] Among Us
[1:25:50] for it is a stiff-neck people and pardon
[1:25:53] our iniquity in our sin and take us for
[1:25:56] thine inheritance
[1:25:58] he said visiting the iniquity of the
[1:26:00] fathers upon the children and upon the
[1:26:03] children's children unto the third and
[1:26:05] fourth generation
[1:26:08] so
[1:26:09] I didn't understand that scripture
[1:26:12] and I remember praying about that Lord
[1:26:15] that's not fair I don't I wasn't arguing
[1:26:17] with the Lord but I didn't feel that
[1:26:18] that was fair
[1:26:20] that if my father was a sinner
[1:26:24] then how come I have to suffer for that
[1:26:28] didn't make sense to me
[1:26:31] really bothered me
[1:26:33] and I was looking at it one day and I
[1:26:36] was reading that and for some reason I
[1:26:39] flipped in my Bible over to Exodus I
[1:26:41] mean over to Ezekiel chapter 18.
[1:26:45] oh different generation here
[1:26:48] listen to this Ezekiel chapter 18 verse
[1:26:51] 18.
[1:26:54] as for his father
[1:26:57] because he cruelly oppressed spoiled his
[1:26:59] brother by violence and did that which
[1:27:02] is not good among his people Lo even he
[1:27:05] shall die in his iniquity
[1:27:08] and yet say ye why
[1:27:11] doth not the son bear the iniquity of
[1:27:15] the father
[1:27:18] when the son hath done that which is
[1:27:19] lawful and right and hath kept
[1:27:22] all my statutes and had done them he
[1:27:26] shall surely live
[1:27:30] seems like a contradiction
[1:27:33] we have Ezekiel we have somebody asking
[1:27:35] him and says here doth not the son by
[1:27:37] the iniquity of the father had to be
[1:27:39] referring back to the scripture that I
[1:27:40] just said and it says that in
[1:27:42] Deuteronomy and other places in Exodus
[1:27:43] it says it often and then over here
[1:27:46] Ezekiel says no
[1:27:51] the soul that sinneth
[1:27:53] it shall die
[1:27:56] the son shall not bear the iniquity of
[1:27:58] the father
[1:28:01] look at that I will visit the iniquity
[1:28:03] Moses said
[1:28:05] of the fathers upon the children
[1:28:08] and Ezekiel saying
[1:28:10] the sun shall not bear the iniquity of
[1:28:12] the father
[1:28:14] neither shall the father bear the
[1:28:15] iniquity of the son
[1:28:18] the righteous of the righteous shall be
[1:28:20] upon him the righteousness of the
[1:28:22] righteous shall be upon him and the
[1:28:24] wicked of the wicked and the wickedness
[1:28:25] of the wicked shall be upon him but if
[1:28:27] the wicked will turn away from all his
[1:28:29] sins that he hath committed and keep all
[1:28:31] my statutes and do that which is lawful
[1:28:34] and right he shall surely live and not
[1:28:36] die
[1:28:40] so what's the answer
[1:28:43] I think the answer is very very plain
[1:28:47] so here we have God saying I
[1:28:52] will visit the iniquities of the fathers
[1:28:56] upon the children and here's the prophet
[1:28:58] Ezekiel saying
[1:29:01] God won't make the children bear those
[1:29:06] iniquities
[1:29:07] of the fathers
[1:29:09] so what's going on here is when these
[1:29:13] young men and young ladies when they're
[1:29:15] when they're at home
[1:29:17] and they see the parents setting an
[1:29:20] example
[1:29:22] they see that they think that that's the
[1:29:26] normal way to do things and then they go
[1:29:28] and do the same sins as the fathers do
[1:29:33] and then they answer for that sin that
[1:29:35] they committed exactly as Ezekiel said
[1:29:38] here it's not con it's not confusing the
[1:29:41] two the scripture it's saying Ezekiel
[1:29:44] saying no he's saying if you sin you'll
[1:29:49] answer for that sin but if your father
[1:29:51] sins and you don't sin you're not going
[1:29:53] to answer for it
[1:29:56] so when we teach our children
[1:29:59] and we set that example before them
[1:30:04] it influences them now there is a way of
[1:30:07] course out of this
[1:30:11] do you want your kids to go to church go
[1:30:13] to church
[1:30:15] do you want your kid to read their Bible
[1:30:17] read your Bible
[1:30:20] do you want your kids to listen to tapes
[1:30:21] listen to tapes do you want your kids to
[1:30:23] like fishing go fishing you want your
[1:30:26] kids to like sports put them in sports
[1:30:28] take them to ball games do you want your
[1:30:30] kids to be gossipers and problems in the
[1:30:32] church
[1:30:33] then you'd be a gossiper and a problem
[1:30:34] in the church
[1:30:37] that's the best influence that you have
[1:30:39] that's the influence that they grow up
[1:30:41] with
[1:30:43] and many times they
[1:30:46] most of the time they will do what the
[1:30:49] parents do and then we have this
[1:30:51] continuing cycle
[1:30:53] my first as I've said my first memory as
[1:30:56] a baby
[1:30:58] was watching those reel-to-reel tapes go
[1:31:01] around
[1:31:03] and hearing brother William Branham
[1:31:06] preacher
[1:31:08] and listening to that over the years
[1:31:11] it was an important thing to my family
[1:31:15] that the kids
[1:31:17] they did that
[1:31:19] now we didn't have Bible studies that
[1:31:21] like I do with my kids we didn't have
[1:31:22] our devotions that I do with my kids but
[1:31:24] we did have that and it made an
[1:31:26] impression on me
[1:31:28] so much so that those that message is
[1:31:31] just part of me and I love it so much
[1:31:36] what if my dad
[1:31:39] and all the mistakes that he made and
[1:31:40] and all the the things that that that he
[1:31:44] did that he would probably would like to
[1:31:45] do different but what if he didn't do
[1:31:47] that
[1:31:49] what if he would have been a Dallas
[1:31:50] Cowboys fan
[1:31:52] and instead of
[1:31:54] worshiping on Sunday
[1:31:57] it was ball games
[1:31:59] I don't have anything against ball games
[1:32:01] but when you're replacing
[1:32:04] the Lord's Day
[1:32:07] and you're replacing it with something
[1:32:08] of the world
[1:32:10] what's going to be important to our kids
[1:32:13] what's going to be the most where what
[1:32:15] are they going to end up doing they're
[1:32:16] probably going to end up doing the same
[1:32:18] thing that they grew up with
[1:32:21] that's why friends that's why the new
[1:32:23] birth
[1:32:24] is so important
[1:32:27] that's why receiving this Same Spirit
[1:32:29] that when Christ was here and the way
[1:32:31] that he acted and the things that he did
[1:32:33] it's so important that God made a way to
[1:32:36] take that spirit
[1:32:39] that was on Jesus Christ and he said you
[1:32:43] can have it in your own life in your own
[1:32:46] body
[1:32:47] so then whatever you learned when you
[1:32:51] were young whatever bad habits you
[1:32:53] learned whatever it was it breaks that
[1:32:56] tradition it breaks that that way
[1:33:01] and it changes that person
[1:33:04] that's why we teach it in church it is
[1:33:06] the most important thing that you will
[1:33:08] hear from this pulpit
[1:33:10] is that you receive the Holy Spirit you
[1:33:13] receive that new birth
[1:33:16] Romans chapter 6.
[1:33:19] says this verse 5.
[1:33:22] if we have been planted together in the
[1:33:24] likeness of his death speaking of Christ
[1:33:28] we shall be also in the likeness of his
[1:33:31] resurrection
[1:33:33] knowing this that our old man is
[1:33:36] crucified with him that old man is the
[1:33:38] previous Daniel Evans
[1:33:40] the previous one that I learned all of
[1:33:43] these bad habits
[1:33:44] from parents or friends or whatever it
[1:33:47] is that previous Man is dead
[1:33:52] crucified on the cross like Christ was
[1:33:57] that the body of sin might be destroyed
[1:34:02] that henceforth we should not serve sin
[1:34:07] for he that is dead is freed from sin
[1:34:09] now if we be dead in Christ
[1:34:12] we believe that we shall also live with
[1:34:16] him
[1:34:18] that's why baptism is important we talk
[1:34:21] about baptism in in I mean pretty much
[1:34:24] all of Christian ranks it's because it
[1:34:27] represents something when when you get
[1:34:29] up in the pool
[1:34:31] and and the the minister baptizes you it
[1:34:34] represents going down into the grave
[1:34:36] and coming up a new person do you come
[1:34:40] up a new person usually not but you are
[1:34:43] making that commitment that I am going
[1:34:45] to do a better job that's why baptism is
[1:34:47] so important it's vital
[1:34:49] to a Christian walk because you are
[1:34:52] saying in front of everybody I'm going
[1:34:53] to change
[1:34:55] I'm going to do my best to change and
[1:34:57] you set that old man back leave him in
[1:35:00] the water
[1:35:01] and then come out of the water
[1:35:05] let's turn to Deuteronomy chapter 4.
[1:35:08] I'm sorry Deuteronomy chapter 6.
[1:35:11] verse 4.
[1:35:15] Moses again speaking
[1:35:18] Moses said this hear o Israel the Lord
[1:35:20] our God is one Lord and thou shalt love
[1:35:23] the Lord thy God with all thine heart
[1:35:25] and with all thy soul and with all thy
[1:35:26] might
[1:35:27] and these words which I command thee
[1:35:30] this day shall be in thine heart
[1:35:34] and thou shalt teach them diligently
[1:35:36] unto thy children
[1:35:39] and shall talk of them when thou sit us
[1:35:42] in thine house
[1:35:43] and when thou walk is by the way
[1:35:46] and when thou lie us down and when thou
[1:35:48] Rises up rise up
[1:35:51] and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon
[1:35:53] thy hand
[1:35:55] and upon the frontless between thine
[1:35:57] eyes
[1:35:58] he's talking to her about a Jewish
[1:35:59] tradition called philocrates when they
[1:36:02] have they have a certain number of
[1:36:04] scriptures and they're written in this
[1:36:06] little written on these little paper
[1:36:07] they put them in this box and they put
[1:36:09] them on their head and then they they
[1:36:10] bind them on the brother lives with left
[1:36:11] arm I think it's a left arm
[1:36:13] left arm you've done it before haven't
[1:36:16] you have you done it before
[1:36:19] have you done it before
[1:36:21] oh okay but you you bind them on your
[1:36:24] hand to represent what you do it bind it
[1:36:26] on your head on your on your forehead
[1:36:28] and then it it reminds you that of what
[1:36:33] you're thinking all the time
[1:36:37] and thou shalt write them upon the posts
[1:36:39] of thy house and upon thy Gates
[1:36:43] Moses is preaching to the fathers here
[1:36:47] he's saying to teach the words of the
[1:36:50] Lord diligently is another translation
[1:36:53] for that diligently teach these things
[1:36:56] other translations says to impress them
[1:36:59] on your children
[1:37:01] and not only our children it says right
[1:37:04] here but our wives and even our guests
[1:37:06] and whoever is sitting in our house
[1:37:09] we should be talking about the word even
[1:37:11] if we're just walking down the road
[1:37:13] walking by the way we should be talking
[1:37:15] with whoever is walking with us about
[1:37:18] the word of the Lord
[1:37:20] it should be all the time the word the
[1:37:23] word the word
[1:37:25] and especially friends to our children
[1:37:31] Let's uh
[1:37:32] because of time's sake let's um
[1:37:37] let's turn to Proverbs it says this
[1:37:40] no no let's turn brother Jordan if you
[1:37:42] would uh I'll skip down let's uh
[1:37:45] let's go to that if you could quit put
[1:37:46] that quote up from Satan's Eden if you
[1:37:48] wouldn't mind so
[1:37:50] when we're when we're reading this Bible
[1:37:52] like Ezekiel
[1:37:55] as he was teaching and he was saying no
[1:37:58] no no no that you don't have to pay for
[1:38:00] the sins of your fathers you don't have
[1:38:01] to pay for what your dad did as long as
[1:38:04] you don't sin
[1:38:06] Ezekiel understood what Moses was
[1:38:10] teaching
[1:38:11] and it is so important for us
[1:38:14] to understand
[1:38:17] what this Bible is saying
[1:38:21] otherwise it's just a bunch of legalism
[1:38:24] it's just a bunch of rules
[1:38:26] legalism was not made a bunch of rules
[1:38:28] was not made to give us salvation
[1:38:31] it can't give us salvation
[1:38:33] it was made to help us through our life
[1:38:36] to understand what is sin and what's not
[1:38:39] sin but Salvation can only come through
[1:38:42] Christ but if we don't understand what
[1:38:45] the word is saying then how can we apply
[1:38:50] it to our lives we can't
[1:38:53] that's just a book of rules
[1:38:55] you know a man has to if he's in the
[1:38:57] Pulpit he has to have a suit on and wear
[1:38:59] a tie and a white shirt and and the
[1:39:01] women have to have hair down to here and
[1:39:02] and a skirt down to here and sleeves
[1:39:04] down to here and and the men can only
[1:39:06] say certain things and they can't do
[1:39:07] this and they can't do that it's just a
[1:39:08] bunch of rules
[1:39:10] but if you understand the meaning if you
[1:39:13] understand why behind those rules now
[1:39:15] you've got something because you can
[1:39:17] apply it to Everyday Life
[1:39:20] That's what Satan does
[1:39:22] he perverts the Nations
[1:39:24] he perverts the church he perverts the
[1:39:26] people he is a deceiver a perverter of
[1:39:29] the original truth God made a man a man
[1:39:32] and he made a woman a woman
[1:39:34] and he dressed them different and he
[1:39:36] meant them just to stay that way and to
[1:39:40] act that way
[1:39:41] one is feminist the other is masculine
[1:39:44] he separated Adam in the Garden of Eden
[1:39:46] and did this and separated Eve from him
[1:39:49] now
[1:39:52] where's her bangs she cuts her hair like
[1:39:54] his and he tries to wear his hair like
[1:39:56] hers
[1:39:57] see she wears his outside clothes and he
[1:40:00] wears her inside clothes now that sounds
[1:40:02] sacrilegious I don't mean it that way
[1:40:03] it's the absolute gospel truth if you
[1:40:06] don't know it then there's something
[1:40:07] wrong with you you're either blind or if
[1:40:10] you've never been on the streets and she
[1:40:12] thinks and he thinks that it's right and
[1:40:15] they're getting along somewhere look
[1:40:17] what it led to now that was in 1965. now
[1:40:20] we have transgender
[1:40:24] and it's wrong
[1:40:25] I know it's not politically correct to
[1:40:27] say that it is a sin
[1:40:30] and we see that we we see a man trying
[1:40:33] to be a woman woman trying to be a man
[1:40:37] it started way back way back here as
[1:40:39] brother branham's talking about
[1:40:43] what he's what he's doing is he's
[1:40:44] quoting Deuteronomy 22 verse 5 the woman
[1:40:47] shall not wear that which pertaineth
[1:40:49] unto a man neither shall a man put on a
[1:40:52] woman woman's garment for all that do so
[1:40:54] or an Abomination to the Lord thy God
[1:40:57] you have to understand why he's saying
[1:40:59] that he's saying that because he wants
[1:41:01] to keep the gender separate
[1:41:05] he doesn't want a feminine weak not weak
[1:41:10] but some a feminine Spirit on a man
[1:41:14] and he doesn't want that dominating
[1:41:16] masculine Spirit on a woman
[1:41:19] and that's where we get so far off into
[1:41:21] today's society and as I said he got he
[1:41:25] he attacked motherhood
[1:41:28] years ago
[1:41:31] and now he's after Dad
[1:41:34] and he wants to pull Dad out
[1:41:39] he wants to pull him out of the whole
[1:41:40] thing
[1:41:43] and I know that I understand
[1:41:47] I'm speaking broadly here but what I'm
[1:41:51] trying to say is those of us that are
[1:41:53] dads
[1:41:54] those of us that that are looking after
[1:41:57] our family we have to have Heath we have
[1:42:00] to have that understanding of what this
[1:42:03] Bible is saying
[1:42:05] otherwise it's just a book of rules and
[1:42:08] it won't work
[1:42:11] but as a as a father as a leader of our
[1:42:14] home we need to spend the time praying
[1:42:17] studying and understanding what this
[1:42:20] means so we can apply it to our family
[1:42:23] so when we're raising our children that
[1:42:25] they will remember these things and they
[1:42:28] will turn out good
[1:42:31] now I know that as I said that as if we
[1:42:36] can get our kids
[1:42:38] to receive that new birth
[1:42:41] if we can get our kids to receive that
[1:42:43] same Spirit of Christ that breaks all
[1:42:46] the bad examples we've ever done
[1:42:50] and I'd also like to say that as I'm I'm
[1:42:52] pushing on the on the fathers
[1:42:56] it
[1:42:59] yeah we have time to read it let's read
[1:43:01] it
[1:43:03] Ephesians chapter 5.
[1:43:07] verse 1.
[1:43:12] be therefore
[1:43:13] followers of God as dear children
[1:43:17] and walk in love
[1:43:19] as Christ hath loved us and have given
[1:43:22] himself for us and offering and a
[1:43:25] sacrifice to God a sweet smelling savior
[1:43:30] so what what he's saying here is how
[1:43:33] beautiful that Christ said father I give
[1:43:36] you my life
[1:43:38] and it came up before the Lord as it did
[1:43:41] in the altar in the Tabernacle it came
[1:43:43] up before the Lord as a sweet smelling
[1:43:46] savior saver and he liked it he it made
[1:43:51] it was acceptable to God
[1:43:54] Christ gives his life
[1:43:57] for that
[1:44:01] let's skip to verse verse 21.
[1:44:06] Paul the Apostle here he is saying
[1:44:09] submitting yourselves one to another in
[1:44:12] the fear of God
[1:44:14] wives submit yourselves to your own
[1:44:17] husbands as unto the Lord
[1:44:20] for the husband is the head of the wife
[1:44:22] even as Christ is the head of the church
[1:44:24] and he is the savior of the body look at
[1:44:29] the importance of the husband look at
[1:44:32] the importance of the father
[1:44:34] he's comparing the dad to Jesus
[1:44:38] I'm talking to the dads now not the
[1:44:40] wives I'm talking to the dads to the men
[1:44:43] that will one day be be husbands will
[1:44:47] one day be fathers
[1:44:49] how should we Act
[1:44:52] how should we take care of our families
[1:44:55] of our children
[1:44:57] we should be we should be willing to go
[1:44:59] to the fire for them
[1:45:01] do everything that we can for them and
[1:45:03] we should be learning this this word all
[1:45:07] the time and praying all the time so
[1:45:08] that we might be that representation of
[1:45:13] Christ to our families
[1:45:15] remember the lion that came out
[1:45:19] there was not a hyena in Africa that was
[1:45:22] going to mess with his family
[1:45:25] he was gonna tear him up and he did
[1:45:29] that's how Dad should be I am going to
[1:45:32] be so in tune with God
[1:45:35] that I am able to be that representative
[1:45:38] of Christ to them
[1:45:42] submitting yourselves one to another in
[1:45:44] the fear of God
[1:45:46] well I've submit yourselves to your own
[1:45:47] husband as unto the Lord for the husband
[1:45:49] is the head of the wife even as Christ
[1:45:51] is the head of the church and is the
[1:45:53] savior of the body therefore as the
[1:45:55] church is subject under Christ so let
[1:45:57] the wives be subject to their own
[1:45:58] husbands and everything we see the
[1:46:00] divine order of the family here this
[1:46:03] isn't me this is the Bible by the way
[1:46:06] I'm not trying to say anything trying to
[1:46:09] slip anything in this is the Bible I'm
[1:46:12] reading
[1:46:14] husbands love your wives
[1:46:17] even as Christ also loved the church and
[1:46:21] gave himself for it
[1:46:24] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[1:46:27] with the washing of the Water by the
[1:46:29] word
[1:46:31] that he might present it to himself a
[1:46:35] glorious church not having spot or
[1:46:37] wrinkle or any such things but that it
[1:46:39] should be holy and without blemish so so
[1:46:42] ought meant to love their wives of their
[1:46:44] own bodies
[1:46:45] he that loveth his wife loveth himself
[1:46:48] treat our wives well
[1:46:54] respect them love them we when we go to
[1:46:58] prayer when we ask the Lord Jesus to
[1:47:00] help us
[1:47:02] how will we like it if he didn't respect
[1:47:04] us
[1:47:05] if you didn't care about us
[1:47:07] and how much should we care about our
[1:47:09] families
[1:47:10] about how much do we care about our
[1:47:12] wives
[1:47:23] so ought to men
[1:47:25] to love their wives of their own bodies
[1:47:27] he that love loveth his wife loveth
[1:47:29] himself for no man ever yet hated his
[1:47:32] own flesh but nourisheth it and cheareth
[1:47:34] it cherishth it even as the Lord the
[1:47:37] church
[1:47:39] speaking about how we should treat our
[1:47:40] wives
[1:47:42] for we are members of his body and of
[1:47:44] his flesh and of his bones for this
[1:47:46] cause shall a man leave his father and
[1:47:48] mother and shall be joined unto his wife
[1:47:51] and they too shall be one flesh
[1:47:55] this is a great mystery
[1:47:57] Paul says but I speak concerning Christ
[1:48:00] in the church
[1:48:02] nevertheless let every one of you in
[1:48:04] particular so love his wife
[1:48:06] even as himself
[1:48:08] and the wife
[1:48:10] see that she reverence her husband
[1:48:13] there's a mutual respect going on here
[1:48:19] and in closing the musicians can come
[1:48:23] friends I'm talking about about dads
[1:48:26] about fathers and about how that
[1:48:28] important they are I hope I've shown in
[1:48:30] just a few scriptures how important it
[1:48:32] is for a dad to live that life
[1:48:37] and you might say well I grew up without
[1:48:38] a dad I didn't I didn't have a dad or or
[1:48:41] my husband isn't a Believer or or
[1:48:43] whatever it is but the whole the same
[1:48:46] Holy Spirit
[1:48:48] that wrote the Bible is the same Holy
[1:48:50] Spirit that's with you whatever
[1:48:51] situation that you're in
[1:48:54] some of us have a little bit harder than
[1:48:56] other others
[1:48:57] but the same God who is rich in Mercy
[1:49:00] that wrote this Bible will be there and
[1:49:04] be able to break that tradition as I
[1:49:08] said if there is sin there
[1:49:10] with the new birth
[1:49:13] and that's why we have to teach teach it
[1:49:15] so diligently
[1:49:17] in our churches we have to teach it
[1:49:20] diligently in our homes and in our
[1:49:22] families fathers have a high high
[1:49:27] example in Christ and we have a great
[1:49:30] responsibility to our families and we
[1:49:33] fall so short
[1:49:35] and as I said at the beginning I've read
[1:49:37] those statistics look at what happens
[1:49:42] when the father doesn't when the
[1:49:44] father's not there
[1:49:45] [Music]
[1:49:47] things Things Fall Apart but thank God I
[1:49:49] know that that there's some that
[1:49:52] single mothers that don't have a husband
[1:49:54] anywhere that doesn't have a husband in
[1:49:56] the home or anywhere
[1:49:58] the holy spirit's there
[1:50:01] and he can he can take care of it
[1:50:04] [Music]
[1:50:06] but those of us and I'm speaking to the
[1:50:08] fathers this morning
[1:50:10] look at how important it is
[1:50:13] that we're good Dads that were good
[1:50:15] husbands
[1:50:16] that we live a life
[1:50:18] that's worthy of this gospel
[1:50:22] and we were able to stand up there that
[1:50:24] we don't
[1:50:25] fall into the Trap Of The World of of
[1:50:27] being a coward
[1:50:31] not willing to stand up for what's right
[1:50:34] [Music]
[1:50:35] because what's going to happen
[1:50:39] generation after generation is going to
[1:50:42] pass
[1:50:45] and then there'll be a generation that
[1:50:48] rises up
[1:50:50] that's talking about the same thing that
[1:50:52] they learned around the supper table and
[1:50:53] they're going to be they're going to be
[1:50:55] talking about about whatever it is
[1:50:57] television and and dress and legalism
[1:51:00] and all that which I I'm not for that
[1:51:02] don't think that don't think that I'm
[1:51:05] not for Holiness I am and I love it I
[1:51:09] believe it pleases the Lord
[1:51:10] but they'll be talking about that
[1:51:13] still talking about the rules and the
[1:51:14] regulations looking for the Lord to come
[1:51:18] and the bride will be gone
[1:51:20] she would have already been so I've
[1:51:22] already been raptured and I won't know
[1:51:24] it
[1:51:26] but we need to make ourselves ready we
[1:51:33] need to be right
[1:51:36] back to Romans
[1:51:38] chapter 6 in closing I want to read that
[1:51:40] again
[1:51:45] [Music]
[1:51:55] says this
[1:51:58] we'll start with verse verse 4.
[1:52:01] now let's start with the first one
[1:52:03] what shall we say then shall we continue
[1:52:06] in sin that Grace May abound God forbid
[1:52:09] how shall we that are dead to sin live
[1:52:12] any longer therein
[1:52:13] know ye not that so many of us as were
[1:52:17] baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized
[1:52:19] into his death
[1:52:23] therefore
[1:52:24] we are buried with him by baptism into
[1:52:28] death
[1:52:29] that like as Christ was raised up from
[1:52:32] the dead by the glory of the father even
[1:52:35] so we also should walk in the newness of
[1:52:40] life
[1:52:42] foreign
[1:52:46] do we still do we still have a baptism
[1:52:49] this morning
[1:52:51] we do if you go and make ready is there
[1:52:54] anyone
[1:52:55] that feels on their hearts to be
[1:52:58] baptized in the name of the Lord to make
[1:53:00] that commitment that I am ready I don't
[1:53:03] want to be what I used to be
[1:53:07] as the Bible says that old man
[1:53:10] I want to be this new man
[1:53:13] I want to be
[1:53:15] something new something fresh and I'll
[1:53:17] make that commitment
[1:53:20] if you have that desire in your heart
[1:53:24] see the see the um the brothers in the
[1:53:27] back
[1:53:29] will baptize you
[1:53:31] but as as
[1:53:33] making ready upstairs I also want to say
[1:53:37] that
[1:53:38] [Music]
[1:53:39] fatherhood
[1:53:42] dads aren't perfect
[1:53:43] [Music]
[1:53:45] and and many of us really really fail
[1:53:50] but
[1:53:52] also appreciate a dad appreciate a
[1:53:55] husband for what he is
[1:53:58] appreciate the fact that he's stayed
[1:54:00] with the family I appreciate the fact
[1:54:02] that he loves that that he loves you
[1:54:06] I appreciate a look at my dad and what
[1:54:09] he was I see all of his failures
[1:54:12] and all the things that he did there
[1:54:14] were many many mistakes but you know
[1:54:17] what he loved me
[1:54:18] [Music]
[1:54:20] he loved me and provided for my family
[1:54:23] and how grateful am I that he did that
[1:54:28] and if you're not if
[1:54:30] if there's not a dad in your life
[1:54:35] give that's friends that's why we have a
[1:54:38] church too
[1:54:40] that's why church is so important
[1:54:42] that the weaknesses that are in all of
[1:54:44] us
[1:54:46] that
[1:54:48] we can account for each other's
[1:54:49] weaknesses and we can help each other
[1:54:51] out
[1:54:52] that's why this body is so important
[1:54:55] friends that's that's why you'll hear
[1:54:57] the pastor say come to church
[1:55:00] because we need each other
[1:55:01] foreign
[1:55:04] God bless you all I pray
[1:55:07] the Lord will give
[1:55:09] each of the dads
[1:55:12] a good day and it's
[1:55:15] in his service and in the goodness of
[1:55:17] the Lord that's that he's given to us
[1:55:21] and we won't have service this evening
[1:55:23] as I said so we can enjoy it with our
[1:55:24] families
[1:55:26] but I do friends I just want to say how
[1:55:29] important it is
[1:55:31] our church family
[1:55:33] how important it is that
[1:55:35] that the right message comes forth from
[1:55:39] the pulpit as the right message comes
[1:55:42] comes to the children and home
[1:55:45] and I
[1:55:48] I'm gonna say what's on my heart
[1:55:51] I'm going to do my best
[1:55:53] and I'm not I'm not gonna
[1:55:57] I guess you could say I've seen so many
[1:56:00] brothers fail I don't want to to bow
[1:56:02] down
[1:56:03] to the establishment
[1:56:05] I don't want to bow down to what is
[1:56:07] taught that you have to preach this this
[1:56:09] and this and this
[1:56:12] I'm going to do my best friends I want
[1:56:13] to preach what's on my heart what the
[1:56:14] Lord lays on my heart and I'll make
[1:56:16] mistakes
[1:56:17] but I'm not gonna do it because a
[1:56:19] denomination tells me to do it
[1:56:22] or an establishment tells me to do it
[1:56:26] I'm just not going to
[1:56:28] God bless you all I'm going to go

[2:12:02] employee from Southwest Gas and he was
[2:12:04] connecting the gas for the stove
[2:12:06] so we got to talking a little bit and we
[2:12:09] shared our lives with each other both
[2:12:11] Christians
[2:12:12] and he said something to me he goes I
[2:12:14] know I was just in a house
[2:12:16] and I've been raised a Christian
[2:12:18] I've been taught this way I'm from the
[2:12:20] Midwest you call him sir you call her
[2:12:23] ma'am
[2:12:25] I knocked on the door she opened the
[2:12:27] door and I said ma'am I'm just here and
[2:12:29] he goes excuse me you don't address
[2:12:31] people that way
[2:12:33] he said I I asked for forgiveness I kept
[2:12:37] talking to her and then I called her
[2:12:39] ma'am again
[2:12:40] because that's how we were raised
[2:12:43] he said and she again scolded me for
[2:12:46] calling and she was an elderly person
[2:12:49] and he said when I got ready to leave I
[2:12:51] called her ma'am again because it's just
[2:12:54] what I do she called my boss
[2:12:58] at the office and he called me and he
[2:13:01] said I know you're a Christian and
[2:13:03] you're just doing this because as you
[2:13:05] are respectful but you can't do that no
