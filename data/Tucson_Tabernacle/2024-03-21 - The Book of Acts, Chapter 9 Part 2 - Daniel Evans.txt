God [Applause] praise God [Music] foreign [Music] if you want to if it's good to know the Lord isn't it First Timothy um chapter you know I believe it's chapter one I didn't put the chapter down let's maybe open our Bibles and look that up First Timothy [Music] I I was telling brother Dan I was just looking at it where Paul is saying here [Music] and I didn't write the verse down so the brothers are verses 12 to 17 so let's find that real quick here [Music] it's where Paul says Ah he says now unto the king eternal [Music] if you could find that here I didn't write the what chapter First Timothy one okay yeah and I just began to read that and I didn't realize that what Paul was speaking about is what brother Dan would be speaking of tonight this is Paul saying I thank Christ Jesus our lord who hath enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor an injurious but I obtained Mercy because I did it ignorantly and in unbelief and the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus this is a faithful sane and worthy of all acceptation that Christ Jesus came into the world to save Sinners who I am chief I wonder how many times Paul went that through his mind how could I have persecuted God he had to live with that but he realized that God's forgiveness how be it for this cause I obtain Mercy that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering for a pattern to them that should Hereafter believe on him to life Everlasting now unto the king Eternal Immortal invisible the only wise God be honor and Glory forever and ever amen I was sharing it with brother Dan and he goes well that's ax Paul I said yeah you're right just hadn't thought of it just share a little testimony and work yesterday there's a young man I've mentioned in Indian young man well he's older than I thought he was he just told me he's in his 40s he looks like in his he's in his 20s and I hadn't seen him for a while and we got into the same house we're both working so we got to talking with him a little bit and we began to talk about forgiveness and and accepting forgiveness and that was my thought to him is you know you have to accept it and there's I told him there's only one sin in the scripture that the Bible says there's no forgiveness to and that is if you blaspheme God I said you say he's not God I said but everything else is forgivable so we got to talking to a little bit about then I could see it was hurting because he was making comments but I'd fail the Lord I said we all fail him no it's not as a righteous one and it came to mind where the man that had run from the battle and he his best friend had gone to President Lincoln and asked for pardon for him and Lincoln just wrote it on a piece of paper and said this pardon this man and when his friend took it to him he said you're you're fooling me it always says this would be an official stationary would be it would be said by some dignitary it would be so he the man lost his life and then it was taken to court and the Court ruled a pardon is not a pardon unless it's accepted as a part and each one of us have got to believe that Lord you have forgiven me I can come into your presence and I just it made my heart glad and when he when he we got ready to leave I had to leave the job site he came over and he gave me a big hug and he said I just so needed that today and I said Lord you know we hadn't seen each other so I go from there to the next house down the road a little ways and I walk in and there's somebody in the that I don't recognize and he's taking some of the doors from our cabinets so I question him and he said well they're broken they're no good I said I know but why are you taking them I got to order them again I said well who are you because I have no idea who this guy is and he uh he says I I work for this company and I said well this is not your house your houses are across the street where two different companies working he said no you guys work for us I'm looking I said I've never seen you in my life you're a about a 20 year old kid that was my thought who are you so we got to talking and he walks out with the parts but he told me of another house so I go down to the other house and he's now taking Parts out of that house too and my first thought this guy's trying to steal stuff but I see his van his van is for the company that does cabinets but he picked up so sorry so I reached over and I said these are not yours don't take them and he got right into my face and said don't you ever touch anything or try to pull anything out of my hand got into my face right here and I walked out after then I said a little bit a few minutes ago I was testifying about the grace of God and over here I wanted to hit that guy and I had to say Lord help me he watches over us all the time you know and I appreciate God just teaching us lessons every day you know and sister Shirley I'm glad you can smile brother Jonathan said the sister that smiles all the time I said sister Shirley always smiling appreciate that but life is just beautiful you no issues no problems right so you can smile no you're like the rest of us but you love the Lord how many loves the Lord Jesus today he's good to all of us isn't he amen it's so good to know that I told Brother Dan for what happened on you know the robbers were there in the middle of his sermon when he stopped and as I said brother Dan my stomach turned as hard as yours when I was watching I said how could that happen but God is good he took control of the service and he does that for his children so as brother Dan prepares to come out here and sing a couple more songs you love him amen I'm amazed that he loves me [Music] for the Lord sometimes I don't know why you would love me but you do and I accept it foreign [Music] oh the only ones that don't get washed are the ones that don't confess so if there's some just say Lord I'm sorry [Music] impressions [Music] and my sins they're all washed away all my sins all that stand as we sing it one more time [Music] on my sins oh washed away my sins our washed away amen thank the Lord for that the flower heads Lord God we thank you for another opportunity to come and to read your word together father over the past 2000 years how many congregations have read these same words that I'll be reading tonight [Music] and how many people have been just blessed by what you have recorded here for us in this book of Acts father we're grateful that we have an opportunity once again together as they have through two thousand years and Lord we pray that the same Holy Spirit that penned this book of Acts through your servant we'll be here tonight we pray in Jesus name amen amen God bless you all you can take your seeds I appreciate it brother Aaron he wasn't planning on well he didn't have a plan that he was going to read that scripture in first Timothy and we were back there and the scripture he read was actually a uh Paul testifying of Acts chapter 9. where he was struck down on the road to Damascus and and everything everything changed I am appreciate I appreciate I just as I was praying I just appreciate the honor to be able to read this read this book um again Sunday I've said it before Sunday is Mother's Day we're just gonna have one service on Sunday and uh Stephanie and I are working on something try to do a little something for the mothers so make sure when you come bring Mama and as as cousin Jonathan would say and uh and we'll have a good time and then on Friday we have a youth Gathering um we're going to concentrate on the younger ones some of the older ones have asked me is it okay if we come and I said sure what we'll do is we will for the upper room we'll leave the one side where the instruments are we'll leave those for the that for the older ones and we'll let the kids the younger ones go upstairs and use the games up there but we'll congregate here in the fellowship hall first and we'll have a Bible study and uh thanks to my friends there I think we have a special surprise for them um Jeremy and Angela God bless you um so yeah we'll be we'll be doing that on Friday night and that starts I believe we put on there at six o'clock so everybody's welcome um Paul on the road to Damascus he was he was struck down on this road he was going to destroy the new converts to keep this new ministry this new way to keep it isolated in this city of Jerusalem and it was starting to to spread out and a light Shone on Paul the light that Paul said was brighter than the sun blinded him he fell on his back blind and then the Lord Jesus spoke to him and he after the Lord had spoke to him and gave him his commission he stayed in Damascus he stayed blind there for three days brother Cedric God bless you I just saw you back there it's good to have you my brother um didn't he eat or drink for three days then a brother named ananias comes to him ananias sees the vision about going to this Saul of Tarsus and praying for him so ananias comes he prays for him Saul is healed of his blindness and then ananias baptizes him then he has a meal with the disciples and then we will start here in Acts chapter 9 verse 19 and let's read it says this and when he had received meat he was strengthened then Saul was certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus and straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues that he is the son of God very important right away look at Paul's Ministry back then Saul he hadn't changed his name yet Saul's Ministry back then look at what he's preaching he preaches Christ and it may seem simple just just to preach this Jesus but it wasn't simple we uh we had a prophet teach us that Christ is the mystery of God revealed he is everything and I can imagine this Saul preaching Jesus Christ from Genesis all the way to the end of Malachi that's all he had to choose from right there and I could see that he was just probably going through each scripture and and each book and bringing him out there but all that heard him were amazed and said is not this he that destroyed them which called on his name in Jerusalem and came hither for that intent that he might bring them bound into the chief priests but Saul increased the more in strength and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus proving that this is the very Christ now this next verse I kind of rushed through the last one and we have time today tonight verse number 23 and after that many days were fulfilled after that many days were fulfilled the Jews took counsel to kill him now after studying this over the over the past few days and as much as I've studied the book of Acts there is a time when Paul he he refers back in the book of Galatians he refers back he said that I went to Arabia for three years now I believe and I I think I'm right this is that time that Paul actually left and he left for three years here let's uh turn to Galatians chapter one and I want to tell you what I'm referring to here verse 11. now you know who the author of Galatians is can you guess Paul but I certify you Brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for I neither received it of man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ now this was important to Paul that he gets this across he's saying hey I didn't learn this in the synagogues I didn't even learn this from the disciples I learned this from Jesus Christ himself very important to Paul that he's he's saying that hey I got this not from somebody else but I got it straight from the source which is Jesus Christ for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews religion how that beyond measure I persecuted the Church of God and wasted it again brother Aaron just like in first Timothy chapter 1 where he was referring to Acts chapter 9 here in Galatians he's referring to Acts chapter 9. and it profited in the Jews religion above many my equals in my own Nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers but when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me that I might preach him among the Heathen you know who the Heathen is we've established that right anybody right amen anybody that's not you immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood I didn't go ask my pastor I didn't go ask my Rabbi I didn't go ask the high priest I didn't confer was FL with flesh and blood neither when I up to Jerusalem to them which were Apostles before me I didn't go to James and John and all of them that walked with Jesus but I went into Arabia and returned again unto Damascus then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and Abode with him 15 days but other of the Apostles saw I nun save James the Lord's brother so there's a time about three years here when Saul of Tarsus studied the scriptures and prayed researched until he was sure about this testimony now remember he got knocked down the Lord Jesus spoke to him said Saul Saul why persecute us thou me he said who are you Lord and he says I'm Jesus whom you persecute he was testing that brother Paul he had this testimony he had this experience but he had to go back and test it with the word it shows really to me it shows why Jesus trusted that Apostle so much to write most of this new testament here because he took such great care he wanted to be right let me read this quote to you something brother Branham said and you know I'm thinking about how much faith and um confidence the Lord hadn't had in Paul to write these letters see Paul may not have known it but the Lord was going to make Paul's letters New Testament Canon I mean this was absolutely the word of God that Paul was writing now here's what brother Branham says about this he says see where he was what a thing it must have been for Paul see all that he had been trained to do was vice versa so now with all the education he had it was just become not to him now he knew that he had experienced he knew that he had an experience so here's another good lesson for us that experience alone isn't enough important experience alone isn't enough it's got to be an experience according to the word of the Lord so him seeing this and know that it is a great something than that someone else somebody else had received it before him he took three years and six months down in the desert in Arabia taking the Bible as it was then the Old Testament and going down there to compare this experience that he had and to see if it was scriptural wow put yourself in Saul of tarsus's in his shoes you are knocked down the Lord speaks to you changes your whole life you're you're smitten blind you're blind for three days then you go and this this man of this new cult that you've been persecuting he comes he prays for you you're healed immediately and then you feel inspired and you you go and you even start preaching and then you say wait wait I got to make sure that I'm right how many would would really take that time not just I'm gonna go pray about it this weekend three years more than three years he he went down and got away from everybody and went down to this other place and prayed there and and searched the scriptures so he would know beyond any doubt that this experience that I have lines up perfectly with this Bible the Mormons are a group that one of the things they'll do some of my best friends growing up are Mormon still close with them fine fine people one of the things that they tell you is take this Mormon Book of Mormon take these things that we teach this teaching of Joseph Smith and and this Revelation take this and you pray about it and then you pray about it and then God will give you an experience to justify what this new faith is sounds good doesn't it makes sense it's false it's false because it doesn't line up with this word right here and it's another thing it's false because they're not saying go try to line it up with the scriptures they're saying you go and seek you go seek an experience and guess what millions of them not thousands hundreds Millions have had that same that experience to where they now say well I prayed about it and now I believe this Book of Mormon and I'm Mormon because they had an experience but it doesn't line up with this Bible but look Paul look at what Paul did Paul had this incredible experience that I mean it was it was on par with Moses Paul has this experience and yet Paul the the man of Great Character that he was he says no I'm gonna go check this out three over three years can you imagine what a man I mean so so often with us it's like I don't have time I got to get out I got to start preaching I got to do this I have my commission wait a minute stop check it with the word don't seek validation don't seek Vindication go back and check it and see if it lines up perfectly then after these three years and Arabia Paul comes back and spends two weeks with Peter Galatians 1 18 then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and Abode with him 15 days so there he is with Peter now he's he's saying okay I've got this all lined out from Genesis all the way here through Malachi which was the last book they had and everything in between and he says it's lined out now I want to go talk to this man that have walked with him that had that had gone around and preached and saw him preach the gospel and all the Miracles that he he had done I'm going to spend two weeks 15 days with this man would you have not loved been a fly on the wall in that conversation Peter and Paul talking I can imagine Paul saying well what did he do when this happened and then Peter said oh we were on the boat and and he stood up on the on the bow of the boat and he said peace be still you know Paul was like yes it's him it's this Messiah that we have always wanted and just really just digging in and just listening to Peter you know and and for like for a pastor for someone that leads the church who would I want to have would I want to have someone that had come up say in in a certain way of thinking or have been educated According to some denomination and and had all of these credentials and just and then just brought it and then started preaching what he had learned or what I want someone that said you know what I'm going to test it and they say oh well you're a doubter no no this word is more important to me than just to take something that I've been taught my whole life I want to take it and I want to really understand it and compare it to this Bible and to make sure it is right those are the kind of leaders we need in church not someone that just thinks about A good sermon and and and then lines it up and and brings it out but someone that has really spent the time and has got themselves out of the way like this Saul of Tarsus and really put it before the Lord and said Lord I'm gonna forget everything I've ever knew just just like he did here and I just want what what you want me to know so let's go back to Acts chapter 9. this was a silent time those three years in Paul's life but at the end of this chapter we're going to see that plenty of stuff is going on Acts chapter 9 where are we at verse 24. so in verse 23 he probably returned from his three-year sabbatical I guess we could call it and after two weeks with Peter now he's back Saul of Tarsus is back on the field but they're laying in weight was known of Saul so so what happened is is they were going to Ambush him but they're laying in weight was known of Saul and they watched the gates day and night to kill him then his disciples took him by night and let him down by the wall in a basket obviously they're in a walled City and when Saul was come to Jerusalem he is saved to join himself to the disciples but they were all afraid of him and believe not that he was a disciple foreign this word of Saved means to try so when when Saul was come to Jerusalem he tried to join himself to the disciples that's sad you think about that he tried to fellowship with the church he wanted to he said hey friends you know I believe the same as you do it okay you stay away I feel this man overcame more than just about anybody in the book over on this side he had the Pharisees and the Sadducees they wanted to kill him and then over on this side he had these Disciples of Jesus these these these men and women of the way as it was called loving the Lord Jesus and out doing Miracles and and spreading the gospel and thousands were being converted all over and they're like you stay away we don't want anything to do with you either we don't really believe that you've converted and there's Paul in the middle yet he's stuck with it what a man stuck with it he knew his he knew his Revelation was sure he had spent the time he had spent the time in prayer he knew and yet both sides were against him right here you know I've seen people had a genuine desire to serve the Lord especially a lot of times it's it's young people and the Lord starts dealing with them they may be in there about 20 years old which is a lot of times when it starts 20 21 18 somewhere around there and the Lord starts dealing with these people with these young people and then they start trying and I'll tell you what church people can be so discouraging and they'll start condemning them they'll start they'll start talking about them and here you have a young man or a young woman who's who's they're not where they should be of course but neither am I where I should be either and I'm up here preaching I'm trying I'm getting better every day and and so are you are you and you should be but then there's these young people they'll come and they're doing their best they're trying and then they get condemned and it just drives them away how many times have I seen it how many times have I seen it at Youth Camp whether whether they'll have an experience and then instead of being greeted by love especially by the elders in the church they're greeted by well now you have to do this and this and this and they're agreed to buy a bunch of rules those rules friends come from the inside out that Holiness it comes from the inside out that love is what can bring those people in and I've seen it I've just seen it too many times but I thank God for a man of real courage like Paul Saul of Tarsus is this sign who stood up against that attitude and he put his own reputation on the line let me let me go back there's this man I want to go back to uh um no let's start at 27. there was a man that put his own reputation on the line which is verse 27 in Barnabas and he brought him to the apostles and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way and that he had spoken to him and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus now remember Barnabas as I said last time Barnabas is this guy that that he was greatly respected in the congregation he had sold a piece of land that was probably worth a fairly large sum of money and he gave it all to the work of the Lord and he this man had had a good reputation so he took Barnabas took his reputation and he laid it on the line for this man named Saul of Tarsus and that's really to me in reading the Scriptures it looks like that's really how Saul started to be accepted I want to do the same how important is it to all of us a friend that would stand for us a friend that would go to battle for us doesn't matter if if we've messed up we've sinned we've done something dumb or or made a fool of ourselves it really feels good to have somebody that loves you have some somebody to put their arm around you and say hey I'm your friend no matter what thick or thin and I'm going to stick up for you when you're not here I'm going to go to battle for you just like this man Barnabas did for Saul and he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem now so so now if Saul is accepted and he's going in and out now let's go to acts 22 for a minute and start with verse 6. now this is later on Paul is giving a testimony of what happened on the road to Damascus and this one they're pretty close they're not exactly the same as we just read in in Acts chapter 9 but Saul many many years later is recounting this verse 6 and it came to pass that this is Paul speaking that as I made my journey and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon suddenly they're shown from Heaven a great light round about me and I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying unto me Saul Saul why persecute us thou me and I answered who art thou Lord and he said unto me I am Jesus from Nazareth whom thou persecute us and they that with me they that were with me saw indeed the light and were afraid that they heard not the voice of him that spake to me I mentioned that in the last service and I said what shall I do lord and there is the Christian you give your heart to the Lord and it's not Lord what will you do for me it's Lord what can I do for you and the Lord said unto me arise and go into Damascus and there it shall be told the of all things which are appointed for thee to do and when I could not see for the glory of the of that light being led by the hand them that were with me I came to Damascus and one ananias a devout man according to the law having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there came unto me and stood up and stood and said unto me brother Saul received thy sight in the same hour I looked upon him now that testimony is pretty much the same as what we read in Acts chapter 9. now listen to this and he said the god of our fathers hath chosen thee that thou shouldest know his will and see that just one and should just hear the voice of his mouth for thou shall be his witness unto all men of what thou has seen and heard and now why tarryest thou arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins calling on the name of the Lord again close pretty close to Acts chapter 9 slightly different but about but about the same and you know it's it's a perfect example let me stop right there for a minute it's a perfect example of I see the brothers except especially people criticize brother Branham because he'll tell tell a story different differently over time and and they say well because he told it differently then it must not be true now right here we see a story that has been told fairly differently over time I believe it's told three times in the book of Acts twice by Paul and once by the original author Luke but just because it's told differently doesn't mean that it's different I was I was uh hunting one time and we I was hunting with my cousins and we we found this um skeleton of this deer and it had a mountain lion claw stuck in the the leg it was the neatest thing so this this mountain lion when it killed the deer it must have yanked out its claw so then I was hunting with my cousins and we we were going we noticed that there was a lot of fox scat in the area and they they go on the top of rocks to mark their territory and then another time uh well and then I was honey with my cousins and my cousin shot this deer the first time he'd ever been out with a bow and he'd shot like one time in the backyard and he pulls back and he kills this this whitetail deer which I've hunted for how many years and I've never been able to kill a whitetail deer with my bow so I tell those three stories but they're all the same story because on on that trip we had found this carcass of this deer it had a lion claw in it I was telling them about these foxes and how they marked their territory and then at the end my cousin uh Kyle kills this deer so just because I may tell this story differently it's still the same story I just leave out certain details and add certain details at different times and that's what is in this book of Acts when Paul is telling these stories sometimes he's leaving out details and sometimes he's putting in details they all happened but he's saying them because of his audience and he wants to focus on certain things like if you're a biologist I would tell the story about the fox you know and and just the different things like that so this wasn't this this part of acts right here wasn't recorded in the original testimony of Acts chapter 9. verse 17. a verse of chapter 22. thank you and it came to pass that when I was come again to Jerusalem even while I prayed in the temple I was in a trance now this is referring back to Acts chapter 9 that what we're studying right now but this is like 30 years later he's telling the story and it came to pass that when I was come again to Jerusalem even while I prayed in the temple I was in a trance and I saw him saying unto me make haste and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me strange that they would receive Peter's testimony those same people but they wouldn't receive Paul's testimony so again look at the resiliency of Paul these people we don't want you but here's Peter and he's out and he's preaching the gospel and Paul may have been saying hey I have a PhD I studied this I went three years I understand all this there's no way that Peter can quote the scriptures like I can quote and yet they're like but we want Peter and we don't want you Paul and I said Lord they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on me and when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed I also was standing by and consenting unto his death and kept the arraignment of them that slew him now we're back to Acts chapter 8. and he said unto me depart for I will send the far hence unto the Gentiles so now let's go back to Acts chapter 9. this is really neat I read that for a reason I don't mean to bore you I read that for a reason there we go Acts chapter 9 verse 29. and he spoke and he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus and dispute disputed against the grecians but they were they went about to slay him now these grecians brother Lyle pointed out that these grecians and other translations are called hellenists they're just Greek speaking Jews which when the Brethren knew they brought him down to caesarea and sent him forth to Tarsus now this caesarea I'm gonna I'm gonna skip that caesarea's uh um I was gonna gonna tell where this place is and then verse 31. then had they the church had the churches rest all throughout Judea and Galilee and Samaria and were edified and walking in the fear of the Lord now let me go back I skipped something I'm sorry I got confused here there's a place that Saul there's a place that in the previous that I just read that Saul it was made known to Saul that this plot that was against him so then what I just read is what Saul is saying later he said that I saw a vision and and I understood what it was that they were going to do to me there verse verse 28. and he was coming in and going out of Jerusalem verse 29 I'm sorry and he spake boldly in the name of Jesus and disputed against the grecians but they went about to slay him which when the Brethren knew they brought him out down they brought him down to caesarea and sent him forth to Tarsus now all the just all of a sudden the disciples and remember what I said about the difference between a disciple and apostle a disciple is anyone that believes Jesus you're with me an apostle is someone that believes Jesus but they're sent out on a mission they have a purpose to go out to do the work of the Lord and that's how Peter and John they could be disciples and they can be Apostles now Saul is also considered one of these Hellenist Jews and how do we know that because he came from a place called Tarsus which is outside of Israel so they sent him back to his hometown of Tarsus and now sawing Saul is going to be out of the picture for a while until chapter 13 in in Antioch now let me let me just sum up everything that I said and I just threw a whole bunch of information to you so so Saul goes and he goes and he separates himself for a while he goes to Arabia then he comes back and he spends 15 days with Peter and then he goes out and he's he's preaching and he's he's winning souls to Christ but then there's a time of quietness and that is right here that we don't see Saul anymore we don't see him in fact according to my Bible remember if you have a Scofield bible in the middle of the pages there you have the dates according to my Bible it's seven years until we see Paul again it says here then the then had the churches rest all throughout Judea and Galilee and Samara so Paul's gone and now we go back to Peter and walking in the fear of the Lord in the comfort of the Holy Ghost they were multiplied now remember I said that this is a pivotal time in in the book of Acts where you have you have Paul he gets his commission he he gets everything square and now he leaves and he goes across the Mediterranean to these Greek speaking Jews and he starts preaching there and now the book of Acts is going to go back to the Judea here back to Jerusalem and back to all of this area of Israel remember Paul's left now and now for the next span of time we're going to stay right here in Israel and we have Peter preaching again and it came to pass as Peter passed through all quarters he came down also to the saints that dwelt at Lita now Lita is on the coast so Jerusalem is not on the coast but if you go north and west all the way to the coast then you'll get to this place called Lita again it's in Israel and there he found a certain man named Enos which had kept his bed eight years and was sick of the palsy so this man had been in his bed for eight years he was crippled he was maybe like a Parkinson's type disease or something like that and Peter said unto him Enos Jesus Christ maketh the whole arise and make thy bed and he arose immediately and all that dwelted Lita and seren saw him and turned to the Lord now what I wanted to get to here was look at the difference between the two ministries of Peter and Paul Paul is this educated man who can take the scriptures and make them in such a way to make the people believe and here's Peter over here Peter doesn't have the education he may not have the Charisma that Paul had but Peter goes over here and he's healing people and they're seeing all of these Miracles and they're like wow I'm going to turn to the Lord because of this man Peter now Peter was sent here to these people that needed that type of thing the ultimate goal the ultimate goal for both of them is to get the people to Christ that is the most important thing it doesn't you know as I said last time you can you can get sick and then you can get healed but you're gonna get sick again the whole thing with healing and and all these Miracles is to help us but it's the main thing is to point us to Christ to show us that Christ is alive and that's what Paul was doing over here Paul is studying the scriptures and he's laying them out and people are coming to the Lord wow just like the eunuch did in in the desert poll ex or um Philip explained it and he gave his heart to the Lord now you see over here Peter's doing Miracles and they're giving their hearts to the Lord that's the ultimate goal for all of it now there was a japa a certain disciple named Tabitha which is by interpretation is called Dorcas this woman was full of good works in alms deej Deeds which she did Tabitha is the Hebrew name and Dorcas is the Greek name again remember who the author is the author of this book Luke he's not the conservative um old-fashioned Jew Luke's not afraid to mention the sisters in neither either his gospel or his book of Acts that's why you see many of the sisters more in the book of Acts and in the Book of Luke and she must have been a this Tabitha must have been a very special lady in because so many people loved her and so many people were crying at her funeral and she was had all these acts of Charity which is alms Deeds it's the same thing as as giving to the poor and it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died whom when they had washed they later in an upper chamber now when it says that they had washed her that is the Jewish ritual of preparing a body to be buried so she died and of course mourned and then they take the body they wash it and then they Anointed with uh with the spices and the ointments that they Anointed with then they put it in the grave before the uh it sounds gross but before the body like starts stinking and and it corruption sets in so they were at that point here and listen to this verse number 38. and for as much as little was nigh unto japa and the disciples had heard that Peter was there they sent unto him two men Desiring him that they would not delay to come to them this is very interesting this sister's dead but they knew that Peter was kind of nearby and they must have remembered now I can't prove this in the scripture but they must have remembered they had maybe heard the story or Maybe someone was there that remembered this story of this man Jairus this man Jairus was a priest with Jesus so Jairus is jairus's daughter was sick he came to Jesus and he said Lord would you come and pray for my daughter she's very sick so Jesus starts on the way and there's Miracles that happen on the way over to jairus's house is when that he was walking along and the the young lady with the blood issue that she came and she touched the very Hem of His Garment and she was healed and he turned and he said who touched me you know the story so he's walking and then it comes back she's dead so Jesus is he continues on and he says no she's not dead she sleeps so he continues on and he goes to this house and there's everybody crying and mourning and all of this and he goes in and he puts everybody out except for Peter and James and John and the mom and the dad so he goes in there and he goes in and he says uh talitha forgot exactly what he said but young lady arise and she rose up a miracle now listen to the way that this scripture in the book of Acts when Peter comes listen to this then Peter arose and went with them and when he was come they brought him into the upper chamber and all the widows stood by him weeping and showing the coats in the garments which dork has made while she was with them again this Tabitha called Dorcas she must have been a very very special lady now what I'm quoting here is Luke chapter eight what I just told that story about Jesus going to Jairus daughter but Peter put them all forth he put them all out and he kneeled down and he prayed so Peter was like hey I've been in this situation before I was there Jesus came in and he put out all of those other people he came in and I got to stand there and I got to watch this and Jesus rose this young lady up now this book of Acts it's like a mirror of the Gospel the the very same things happen in the book of Acts that happened in when Jesus was here now listen to this but Peter put them all forth put them all out and kneeled down and prayed and turning him to the body said Tabitha arise and she opened her eyes and when she saw Peter she sat up and he gave her his hand and lifted her up and when he had called the Saints and widows presented her alive mirror of Luke chapter 8. exactly the same it was the same It Was the Same Spirit that was in Jesus that went to jairus's daughter that Rose her up look at that Spirit was now in this man Peter and Peter went in and did the exact same thing and what's amazing to me is those disciples call them after she was dead they called him and it was known throughout Joppa and many believed in the Lord and it came to pass that Isaiah carried many days in Joppa that he he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a Tanner now in Acts chapter 9. as I said this is a pivotal time this is when that we have Jerusalem and the Jews and the message going around there and then it starts to kind of Squirt out to the areas around there and then it it gets to Damascus and then we have Paul step on the scene now we have a transition period from chapter 9 to chapter 12 or chapter 13 when things really start to shift and it's amazing shift that happens right here and we look back we see that now we have really these two great Servants of the Lord and I'm wrapping up if the musicians want to come we have these two great Servants of the Lord going out and preaching the gospel we have this period of quietness we don't really know what's going on for about seven years that Saul of Tarsus he goes out away from from Judea to the to the Greeks to the greek-speaking Jews and also to the Gentiles and now we have Peter just primed to see a major shift in the whole Ministry and this major shift is what we call the Gentile dispensation and it's all starting right here and things something is going to happen in this next chapter in Acts chapter 10 that is really going to just solidify that and change everyone especially as Peter's way of thinking because the Lord is going to instruct him now all right now we're going to move in a different direction you're with me and that is Acts chapter 10. so Acts chapter 9 we see this we see the Apostle Paul we see we see him change we see him go out and study and the most important thing that I want everyone to get tonight is what I said about him going and studying for these for these three years and how that he had this great experience but yet he had to check it with this word and even as great of a theologian as he was and how well he knew it he still it was such an important decision that he had to make sure that it lined up with this Bible amen well we got through Acts chapter 9. it's uh it's a great book I enjoy it so much I uh sorry I got I got uh a little bit confused there before but I was I was wanting to bring out that it was so neat to me that that in the beginning of Acts it says that that it was made known to Paul and then later he said that I saw a vision and the Lord warned me to go out sometimes you wonder why it's like Lord why did you warn him why don't you just wipe it away why don't you just kill him but it's just God's way he has his way of doing things and one thing that in the book of Acts that I'm seeing more and more that's a theme is God uses different people it's not all just one Prophet or or one person that's doing everything this holy spirit is spread out and they really they work together like the disciples let Paul out on the basket over the wall and he got to safety he he's just he's having everybody really work together and and this gospel starting to spread and now in this next chapter we're going to see wow big big [Music] Miracle happen and we even see a gentile seeing a vision in the next chapter God bless you all let's stand thank you [Music] for there and if you would lead a ladies and song Open my mind to reach out I had to say that we love him open are you is [Music] we
