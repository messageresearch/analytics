[16:13] amen he is alive and he lives
[16:21] i don't think i gave amen to the
[16:22] brothers
[16:26] [Music]
[16:37] me
[16:38] lord to thee
[16:41] take my
[16:43] [Music]
[16:48] life live in me
[16:52] take my life lord let me
[16:58] consecrate
[17:00] me
[17:00] lord to thee
[17:06] [Music]
[17:14] take my
[17:17] [Music]
[17:20] consecrate
[17:22] lord to thee
[17:25] take my life
[17:32] amen i don't just want them living in
[17:34] this
[17:35] around us i want them living in me amen
[17:38] amen live in me live in me lord
[17:41] we're going to do something maybe a
[17:42] little different this morning
[17:45] i'm going to say this
[17:46] i think the lord has blessed us as a
[17:48] congregation
[17:50] with wonderful ministry in our local
[17:52] assembly
[17:54] maybe we sometimes
[17:56] doesn't always be how we want it or it's
[17:58] not the person we want or it's not the
[18:01] meeting we want or the vote or the
[18:03] situation but the lord has fed us as a
[18:05] congregation locally
[18:07] and
[18:10] brother branham talks about co-pastors
[18:12] and i think
[18:13] these three men here on the
[18:15] the front these three brothers here and
[18:17] brother aaron have all
[18:19] fed the sheep in their way maybe not
[18:21] without a specific assignment or a vote
[18:24] or
[18:25] you know an authority specifically but
[18:27] in their humble sort of way they've
[18:29] they've fed the sheep and i think
[18:31] sometimes we can just
[18:34] be
[18:35] sometimes ungrateful and thankful what
[18:37] the lord has just given us
[18:39] and so this morning we're going to hear
[18:40] from all four of them this morning and
[18:42] we're just going to let the lord lead
[18:44] them
[18:45] and let us hear what
[18:47] what would we would have to hear amen
[18:50] so as we change the order of the service
[18:52] we're going to sing some songs
[18:53] throughout the service as well we're
[18:55] gonna just turn it over a little bit
[18:57] earlier to brother aaron to start off
[18:59] this morning let's stand and let's just
[19:01] sing that song again live in me lord
[19:03] live in me take my life
[19:05] and let it be amen as brother aaron
[19:07] comes live in me
[19:10] lord
[19:11] live in me
[19:14] take my life
[19:16] lord let it be
[19:20] consecrate
[19:22] me lord to thee
[19:26] take my life
[19:28] [Music]
[19:38] jesus
[19:39] i'm sorry
[19:40] live in me
[19:46] take my life
[19:48] [Music]
[19:54] lord to thee
[19:57] take my life
[19:59] [Music]
[20:16] lord to thee
[20:18] [Music]
[20:30] is
[20:34] he is lord
[20:40] he has risen
[20:42] from the dead and he is
[20:47] [Music]
[21:11] amen he is lord
[21:13] thank you sisters and
[21:15] there's going to be a little bit of
[21:16] movement because they're going to come
[21:17] back up to play but
[21:19] probably
[21:20] it'll be a little while so you can see
[21:22] them
[21:23] when we when we're praying on wednesday
[21:26] night's prayer meeting
[21:28] i just asking the lord something about
[21:30] sunday it's it's easter it's
[21:32] resurrection sunday
[21:34] just felt the lord just shared in my
[21:35] heart one's your four brothers
[21:38] take a portion and he'd share something
[21:40] that's in their hearts so
[21:41] we talked with him
[21:43] didn't have to twist a single arm they
[21:45] said yes that would be good so
[21:48] while we're standing let's take the
[21:50] first scripture
[21:52] and i know
[21:53] each one of us were
[21:54] kind of what are you going to miss john
[21:56] what are you going to minister on how
[21:57] are we going to overlap are we using the
[21:59] same scriptures
[22:00] and brother dan's
[22:02] said something that really had never
[22:04] thought of he said well mark
[22:05] and john
[22:07] and matthew
[22:08] and luke
[22:09] i wonder if they went to that what did
[22:10] you put in your book what did you write
[22:13] but no even if we heard it a hundred
[22:15] times it's still the same it's still the
[22:17] word of god so
[22:19] john 15
[22:21] 13.
[22:23] greater love hath no man than this
[22:26] that a man laid down his life
[22:29] for his friends
[22:32] how many are friend of god today
[22:35] he lay down
[22:36] his life for you you may be seated
[22:40] then brother dan asked and
[22:43] he said so
[22:44] what are you going to minister on
[22:45] brother
[22:49] the other ones were thinking it brother
[22:51] dan thought it out loud
[22:55] and i said we're going to talk about
[22:56] saturday
[22:59] a little bit there
[23:01] but the basis on this is god is love
[23:05] and everything he's done
[23:07] and does and will continue to do is
[23:09] motivated by love
[23:12] the greatest force that there is is love
[23:16] because it's not a destructive force
[23:19] it's a force that draws you back to god
[23:21] it's something that makes you where he
[23:23] says you can be like me
[23:26] and there's no competition in it
[23:28] there's no well i'm better than you no
[23:30] we all come under that same
[23:33] we're his bride as joseph when he put
[23:35] his bride
[23:36] aside and yet ministered to his brothers
[23:40] he didn't put one over the other
[23:43] and he looks at it the same way today
[23:45] but
[23:46] he says greater love hath no man that he
[23:49] lay down his life
[23:50] for his friends
[23:53] and you know looking at that and and
[23:55] saying brother branham says in the
[23:56] message
[23:58] and and this came
[24:00] brother jordan sent out a text the other
[24:02] day
[24:02] and he said i've been listening to this
[24:04] message
[24:05] shepherd of the sheepfold and he sent it
[24:07] out to us
[24:09] brothers that minister in all and part
[24:10] of the church here and we all got him
[24:12] and i began to listen to it and this
[24:14] really struck my heart right here
[24:17] if you would put that quote up there
[24:21] and then after he gets them all numbered
[24:23] and they're all bedded down the shepherd
[24:25] goes down by this hole where the sheep
[24:28] come in at
[24:29] and he lays himself down across that
[24:32] hole
[24:32] then no wolf can come in no thief can
[24:35] come in no harm can come in
[24:38] lest it come over
[24:40] that shepherd first
[24:43] that he would lay down his life for you
[24:46] and for me
[24:48] he says what a picture of christ laying
[24:50] himself down for us that nothing can
[24:52] harm us unless it comes over him
[24:55] now watch what he says here so if you're
[24:57] sick and you say brother branham
[24:58] sickness crossed over him
[25:01] but it was for the glory of god
[25:04] now that's the hard part at times how is
[25:06] god going to get glory over this
[25:08] he says
[25:09] that's right he wants to maybe give you
[25:12] a testimony as a fellow said one time
[25:14] he's seen a shepherd with he's packing a
[25:17] sheep and he said well
[25:19] had his leg all bandaged up and he said
[25:21] well
[25:22] what did you what's the matter did it
[25:24] fall off a cliff he said no
[25:25] i broke its leg oh
[25:28] he said you must be a cruel shepherd to
[25:30] break your own sheep's leg
[25:33] god why are you doing this to me why are
[25:37] you letting this happen to me why am i
[25:39] going through this today
[25:41] braham says there's going to be a
[25:42] testimony out of this
[25:44] there's going to be praise go to god
[25:46] there's also going to be something in
[25:47] your life that you're going to realize
[25:48] that he cares for you and you're going
[25:50] to be confident in him
[25:51] he's never failed me never let me down
[25:53] he says
[25:54] he said no the sheep wouldn't mind me so
[25:56] i had to break her leg in order to hold
[25:59] her pet her and love her
[26:00] and give her a little special food so
[26:02] that she would look would love me and
[26:04] follow me
[26:06] and so sometimes god has to do that to
[26:08] us let the doctor say oh it's all over
[26:11] nothing could be done and then god takes
[26:13] you up in his arm and pats you a little
[26:15] bit and says child of mine
[26:17] you don't know how i love you
[26:20] don't you know i'm the lord that healeth
[26:22] all thy diseases
[26:24] but lord i was taught the day of
[26:27] miracles i know you was but i just had
[26:29] to let this happen so i could show you
[26:31] your uh you're a little special favor
[26:34] now don't you love me just a little more
[26:36] now i'm going to let you get well did
[26:38] you ever have
[26:39] just come to you
[26:41] i have many times
[26:44] looking back sometimes you say oh that
[26:46] was god
[26:47] god had his hand in it all
[26:49] he never left me alone i was never a
[26:51] place where really when i thought i was
[26:53] alone but he was there
[26:56] now when you think about that and again
[26:58] you look at the scriptures
[27:02] greater love hath no man than this that
[27:04] he lay down his life for his friends
[27:07] john 3
[27:08] 14-17
[27:12] as moses lifted up the serpent in the
[27:14] wilderness even so must the son of man
[27:16] be lifted up
[27:19] all the word up to verse 17
[27:21] that whosoever believeth him should not
[27:24] perish but have eternal life
[27:27] and probably one of the most quoted
[27:29] scriptures
[27:30] maybe today for god so loved the world
[27:33] that he gave his only begotten son
[27:37] the one who he broke
[27:40] the one who he had scorched
[27:42] the one who he had whipped
[27:45] for you and for me
[27:48] you ever looked at it this way
[27:50] he was god's sheep and he said i'm going
[27:51] to do that he was god's son i'm going to
[27:53] do that to him in your place
[27:56] that whosoever believeth in him should
[27:58] not perish but have everlasting life
[28:01] for god sent not his son into the world
[28:04] to condemn the world
[28:06] but that through the world
[28:07] the world through him might be saved
[28:12] for one more one more scripture john 4
[28:14] 10.
[28:17] here in his love
[28:19] not that we loved god
[28:21] but that he loved us
[28:23] and sent his son to be the propitiation
[28:26] for our sins
[28:28] i would ask you today
[28:31] there's something going to happen to
[28:32] this church it's going to fall apart
[28:34] something's going to happen
[28:36] but would you be willing to be the one
[28:38] to take all of that to yourself to save
[28:40] this church
[28:44] brother branham talks about that man and
[28:46] i forget the country now but he took all
[28:48] the spears of the of the enemy
[28:51] but it rallied the troops
[28:54] that was our lord and savior jesus
[28:57] christ
[28:58] now to think about that
[29:03] and then
[29:05] saturday
[29:07] in between friday and sunday is saturday
[29:13] we get at the accounts in the bible
[29:17] quite a bit is written
[29:18] of those three days
[29:21] quite a bit of the scriptures
[29:23] talk about those three days because this
[29:27] was
[29:28] god's plan all along
[29:30] a plan of redemption
[29:32] a plan to draw people back his children
[29:35] back the same as he did when he came
[29:37] that's that last time or that time
[29:39] knowing what adam and eve had done
[29:42] it was not a surprise to him he didn't
[29:44] come down and said where are they
[29:46] he calls out adam adam word though but
[29:49] he knew where he was
[29:51] he knew what had happened
[29:53] it had all been in the back part of his
[29:54] mind i'm a redeemer
[29:57] i'm a savior i'm a healer i do all of
[30:00] this but how can i demonstrate that if
[30:02] there's nobody sick there's nobody lost
[30:04] if there's nobody hurting
[30:07] so he allowed it to be
[30:09] jesus is silent on saturday
[30:12] the woman have anointed his body and
[30:14] placed it in joseph's tomb
[30:16] the body of christ is as mute as a stone
[30:19] which guards it
[30:21] he spoke much on friday
[30:24] he will liberate the slaves of death on
[30:26] sunday
[30:27] but on saturday jesus is silent
[30:30] but understand this that's what from the
[30:33] outside
[30:34] it looked like
[30:36] because on saturday we know what he went
[30:38] and did on saturday
[30:40] when he went and he knocked on the
[30:43] where are those keys
[30:45] when you hear the voice of those saying
[30:47] hey
[30:47] that's the one that we were looking
[30:49] that's the wheel in the middle of the
[30:51] wheel
[30:52] he's going now and preparing all of this
[30:54] now
[30:57] and he says so is god he made himself
[30:59] heard on friday he tore the curtains of
[31:01] the temple open the graves of the dead
[31:05] rock the earth block the sun of the sky
[31:09] sacrifice the son of heaven
[31:11] earth heard much of god on friday
[31:14] nothing on saturday
[31:16] jesus is silent god is silent saturday
[31:19] is silent
[31:22] have you ever been on one of those
[31:23] saturdays yourself
[31:26] where you're wondering where is god
[31:29] i thought
[31:31] wasn't he supposed to wasn't this going
[31:33] to be our great redemption isn't this
[31:35] when he was going to overthrow the
[31:37] romans all these things that they had
[31:39] thought were going to happen but
[31:40] saturday
[31:42] it's quiet
[31:43] the tomb is still sealed
[31:46] nobody has seen him yet
[31:48] there was no testimony there's no
[31:50] sisters to run to the disciple and say
[31:52] we have seen him he has risen
[31:55] that's on saturday
[32:00] easter weekend discussions tend to skip
[32:02] saturday friday and sunday get all the
[32:05] the press
[32:06] the crucifixion and the resurrection
[32:08] command our thoughts
[32:11] don't ignore saturday because you have
[32:14] them too
[32:18] and that's after a saturday
[32:22] when all seems still when all seems lost
[32:24] and god comes to you
[32:26] that is the most precious time of your
[32:28] life
[32:31] silent saturday is the day between the
[32:33] struggle and the solution
[32:36] the question and the answer
[32:38] the offered prayer
[32:40] and the answered prayer
[32:43] saturday silence torments us
[32:46] is god angry
[32:48] did i disappoint him
[32:51] god knows jesus is in the tomb
[32:53] why doesn't he do something
[32:57] lord you know what i'm going through
[32:59] you know the mental struggles you know
[33:00] the physical struggles
[33:02] you know the hurts
[33:04] the loss of a loved one
[33:06] the somebody that turned their back on
[33:08] you something that has changed something
[33:09] has just gone completely different
[33:11] god where are you in this
[33:15] you read listen to brother branham's
[33:16] life story
[33:18] a man sent from god and he came to that
[33:20] exact place
[33:22] he said i'm driving down the road and
[33:24] satan's sitting on the seat next to me
[33:26] talking to me and telling me where is
[33:28] this god
[33:29] where is he now
[33:32] and he'd have to remind himself of that
[33:34] living god
[33:36] then why did that goiter fall off where
[33:38] did that healing come from where did
[33:40] this answer come from
[33:42] and he had to re-encourage himself
[33:50] your marriage is in a mess
[33:54] your life isn't a mess
[33:57] the things that you were promised or you
[33:58] seem to hope they just don't be coming
[34:00] that way
[34:02] the road to emmaus comes up about that
[34:04] time
[34:05] let's just go back
[34:07] to what we're doing
[34:09] where peter says well i'm just going to
[34:11] go back and start fishing again i know
[34:12] how to do that
[34:16] brother peter what brother john what
[34:19] i thought he said that he'd never leave
[34:21] us
[34:22] he'd never forsake us i'll be with you
[34:24] always he said
[34:26] where is he today
[34:29] listening to brother donnie reagan as he
[34:32] spoke in the meetings the youth services
[34:35] in in
[34:36] louisiana
[34:37] and he made a comment and made me stop
[34:39] to think a bit
[34:41] he said if brother branham was still
[34:43] alive today
[34:44] we'd be falling everywhere he is
[34:49] he's going to be in phoenix no sunday
[34:51] service here we're going to phoenix
[34:53] he's going to be over here and he made
[34:54] this come he goes how many message
[34:56] churches would there be established
[34:57] today or would we just be following him
[34:59] everywhere he went
[35:02] but jesus said i have a better way than
[35:05] this
[35:07] but it took his death
[35:09] it took his
[35:11] punishment for you and i
[35:13] in order to provide it
[35:16] and he also had to say not my will but
[35:19] thy will be done
[35:21] he had to come to that place where he
[35:22] humbled himself and said
[35:25] lord
[35:26] not my will but thy will be done
[35:31] sometimes that's the hard part
[35:33] lord i i've had my mind set on this i've
[35:35] had this i've wanted to do i've wanted
[35:38] to go this direction i thought this is
[35:40] how it would come out
[35:42] and god says
[35:43] are you willing to let it go
[35:45] are you willing to say hey
[35:47] i'm willing to do whatever you say lord
[35:51] see he knew the scripture said i will
[35:54] not leave his soul in hell neither will
[35:57] he
[35:58] he knew those scriptures
[36:00] and he said i've got to go to this in
[36:03] order for that to be fulfilled
[36:06] you're in the saturday of your life
[36:09] but sunday's coming
[36:12] the resurrection now there will be a
[36:14] physical resurrection there will be a
[36:16] complete change of this body when this
[36:17] mortal shall put on immortality
[36:21] and we look towards to that
[36:23] we look so much to that sometimes when
[36:25] we're in the middle of something hard
[36:26] something tough
[36:28] lord although it would happen today
[36:31] but god's got a reason and a place for
[36:33] it all
[36:36] then came the morning
[36:40] sunday the bible tells us our sisters
[36:42] had gone over to anoint the body
[36:46] after they had been told i would lay
[36:48] this life and in three days i will raise
[36:50] it back up nothing he had ever done had
[36:53] disappointed them because he had kept
[36:55] his word
[36:56] there wasn't that thing where they could
[36:58] say well you remember that one time he
[37:00] told us this but it didn't work out that
[37:02] way
[37:03] remember of those those bases that he
[37:06] told them fill them with water and
[37:07] they'd become wine but two of them
[37:08] didn't change
[37:10] there was never anything like that with
[37:11] god
[37:13] it's exactly what god said took place
[37:15] when he said lazarus come forth there
[37:17] was like okay hang on hang on i got to
[37:19] go pray some more no no he spoke in the
[37:21] beginning he said loosen
[37:23] they had seen it over and over and over
[37:27] but the one they had laid their hope
[37:30] all of this
[37:31] could i say the man's side the one they
[37:34] walked with the one that john laid his
[37:36] his head on their bus on his bosom
[37:39] the one that turned around and said
[37:40] peter feed my sheep
[37:42] he'd also told peter he said you're
[37:44] going to deny me and peter said no way
[37:48] but he also said on resurrection sunday
[37:50] and peter too
[37:52] so my brother my sister sometimes when
[37:54] you're feeling that way he'll call your
[37:56] name i'll say you too
[37:57] you're included on this
[38:00] so
[38:01] it's sunday
[38:02] morning what we call easter morning
[38:05] resurrection morning
[38:07] without a resurrection we might as well
[38:09] close up the church and go home
[38:12] because then there's no hope
[38:16] brother branham and and and when they
[38:17] played the the excerpt yesterday at the
[38:20] memorial
[38:21] the one we had spoken on a couple weeks
[38:23] before
[38:24] when brother branham crosses over to the
[38:27] other side
[38:29] was that part not true and the rest of
[38:31] the message is true
[38:33] oh that was the word of god being
[38:35] expressed to us down
[38:36] another glimpse of it hey we're going to
[38:38] go home it's going to be like this
[38:42] dad was coming in this morning i went
[38:44] out to help him come in i said how are
[38:45] you doing
[38:47] he said okay
[38:48] but my legs really hurts getting harder
[38:50] and harder to walk
[38:53] i go back in my mind i remember dead as
[38:55] far back as i can remember strong and
[38:58] healthy and always able to do whatever
[39:00] we had needed
[39:03] in fact if not too long ago
[39:05] you would tell them dad take it easy
[39:07] when you shake my hand because you will
[39:08] almost break my fingers
[39:11] but now i see them but you know what
[39:13] there's a promise
[39:15] there's a hope that is greater than hope
[39:18] there's a revelation that is set down in
[39:20] your heart and it's real
[39:22] and that's what's holding you that's
[39:24] what's keeping you
[39:26] sunday morning
[39:29] sunday morning we're going back to the
[39:31] tomb
[39:32] we're going to anoint his body
[39:34] we're going to have to deal with
[39:36] soldiers who's going to move roll the
[39:38] rock
[39:39] who's going to do this
[39:41] hey they were like us
[39:43] you know they were just like us how's
[39:45] this going to happen brother greene
[39:47] talks about flying with the with the um
[39:50] casket all the way back with his head to
[39:53] his ear to it saying waiting to hear
[39:55] brother brown said brother green open it
[39:57] up
[39:59] jesus didn't have to say i'm waiting for
[40:01] somebody to open the door
[40:04] no sir
[40:05] no sir
[40:06] he said let the stone be rolled away and
[40:08] it moved he walked out he's jesus christ
[40:12] the same yesterday today and forever
[40:15] sunday morning
[40:19] and still they had trouble believing
[40:23] we have seen him the sisters come up we
[40:25] have seen him we talked to him and the
[40:27] scripture tell us they said no no no no
[40:29] you're confused he didn't
[40:31] on the road to emmaus all the way back
[40:33] home the very one that they were waiting
[40:36] for they had spent this time with is
[40:38] walking next to him and they don't
[40:40] recognize him
[40:44] and he begins to tell them everything
[40:46] that was in the scriptures and that's
[40:48] what he talked about
[40:51] i came to fulfill my father's commands
[40:54] the word says this as moses was if you
[40:57] had known moses you would have known who
[40:59] i am he's telling them everything he
[41:00] didn't vary from the scriptures
[41:03] that was his identification that was how
[41:05] we were going when he said let there be
[41:09] and that was god and there was light he
[41:12] had to believe his own word and there
[41:13] was light
[41:15] when he said thy faith has made thee
[41:17] whole and was no different it was him
[41:19] speaking
[41:21] they hadn't seen it all but now they're
[41:23] walking back
[41:25] and they're saying then he goes hey what
[41:27] are you guys talking about
[41:29] you guys look really disappointed
[41:31] discouraged
[41:33] man
[41:34] you know if you could walk any slower
[41:36] and look or dead you would be dead
[41:40] and they turn around and look at him
[41:44] how would you feel brother peter if i
[41:45] turn around look at you one day with his
[41:47] absent look at my face and said who are
[41:48] you
[41:50] you'd probably think i'm kidding
[41:52] but what if you realized i was serious
[41:55] how would that affect your heart
[41:57] brother aaron doesn't know me what's
[41:59] wrong with him
[42:02] this is what who are you where have you
[42:04] been don't you know what just happened
[42:08] and he's like yeah i was there i was
[42:11] honestly there
[42:14] in fact i was the main attraction if you
[42:16] could put it that way
[42:18] and they walk six hours with him
[42:20] and he begins to what
[42:23] tell him what this says
[42:26] all he ever did
[42:28] and they still don't realize it's him
[42:32] they come to that place where
[42:34] they're going to go to their home
[42:36] and he says well i'll just continue on
[42:39] they said you know there's something
[42:40] about you and i know you didn't you
[42:42] didn't see it you know but just you know
[42:44] come on and rest yourself sit with us
[42:46] for a little bit here and
[42:49] and then you can travel on
[42:52] and he says okay
[42:53] not like he didn't know this was going
[42:55] to happen but
[42:56] okay and when he begins to break the
[42:59] bread
[43:00] and their eyes become open
[43:02] he's alive
[43:04] he's alive it's him
[43:06] and he goes on
[43:08] oh that god would make it more surreal
[43:11] than it ever has been in you
[43:13] he's alive
[43:14] he never changes he's god
[43:17] the omnipotent
[43:19] who loved you
[43:20] in me
[43:21] more than anything else
[43:24] and then they go back and they tell the
[43:25] other disciples we have seen him and
[43:27] they're like thomas unless i see him
[43:31] unless i touch his wounds unless i i'm
[43:34] not going to believe it
[43:37] god called him o faithless thomas but he
[43:40] didn't say you're not one of us anymore
[43:43] he didn't throw him out said okay bring
[43:44] somebody else in because obviously
[43:46] thomas is not a believer
[43:48] how many would raise our hands and say
[43:50] there are times that oh lord i felt like
[43:51] a thomas
[43:53] i struggled through this but god rich in
[43:55] mercy said and peter too
[43:58] and called your name and said you're

[49:03] psalm 1 and revelation 1.
[49:05] all right genesis 1
[49:08] 11

[49:11] i've got a lot so if you just pray for
[49:12] me and if you if you'll pull then
[49:15] should be less than 45 minutes
[49:20] and god said
[49:22] let the earth bring forth grass
[49:25] the herb yielding seed
[49:27] and the fruit tree yielding fruit after
[49:29] his kind
[49:30] whose seed is in itself
[49:33] upon the earth and it was so
[49:35] amen psalm 1 chapter 1
[49:40] see every
[49:41] seed bringing forth after their kind in
[49:43] the beginning
[49:44] and then let's psalm 1 and 1
[49:48] it says
[49:49] blessed is the man
[49:52] that walketh not in the counts of the
[49:53] ungodly
[49:56] nor standeth in the way of sinners
[49:58] nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful
[50:01] but his delight is in the law of the
[50:02] lord
[50:03] and in his law doth he meditate day and
[50:06] night
[50:07] and he shall be like a tree planted by
[50:09] the rivers of water
[50:11] that bringeth forth his fruit
[50:14] in his season
[50:15] there's the key there those words in his
[50:17] season
[50:18] his leaf also shall not wither
[50:21] and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
[50:24] and revelation chapter 1 verse 4.
[50:30] we'll read and then and then you can be
[50:32] seated for a few minutes
[50:34] probably not enough time to to get a
[50:35] good nap but at least you can be seated
[50:38] revelation 1 chapter 4
[50:41] [Laughter]
[50:43] all right
[50:44] um
[50:45] revelation 1 and we'll read 4 to 8.
[50:49] it says john
[50:50] to the 7 churches which are in asia
[50:53] grace be unto you in peace from him
[50:55] which is
[50:56] which was and which is to come and from
[50:59] the seven spirits which are before his
[51:01] throne
[51:02] and from jesus christ
[51:04] who is the faithful witness
[51:06] and the first begotten of the dead
[51:08] that's the part i want to emphasize here
[51:10] and the prince of the kings of the earth
[51:13] unto him that loved us amen were therein
[51:16] and washed us from our sins in his own
[51:18] blood
[51:19] and hath made us kings and priests unto
[51:21] god and his father to him be glory and
[51:24] dominion forever and ever amen behold he
[51:26] cometh with clouds and every eye shall
[51:28] see him and they also which pierced him
[51:30] and all the kindreds of the earth shall
[51:32] wail because of him even so amen i am
[51:34] alpha and omega the beginning and the
[51:36] ending saith the lord which was which is
[51:39] which was which is to come the almighty
[51:42] amen you may be seated for a few minutes
[51:44] i've i've already used a third of my
[51:46] time so so help me out
[51:50] you know easter
[51:51] is one of the most glorious days there
[51:53] is and it's such a joyous day what a
[51:56] what a holiday that we can we can look
[51:59] and we call it easter and there's
[52:01] different theories about the
[52:02] that name but really it's resurrection
[52:05] sunday if i could call it you know
[52:07] resurrection sunday that's a better
[52:09] description than easter
[52:11] and
[52:12] we can look back and of all the stories
[52:14] in the bible
[52:16] this one is the most important
[52:20] you know there's
[52:22] there's calvary which in in some ways is
[52:24] more important in a lot of ways it's
[52:26] more important
[52:27] but if there was calvary
[52:29] [Music]
[52:30] and there was no resurrection
[52:32] then the apostle says it's all in vain
[52:36] there has to be this resurrection sunday
[52:39] for any of this to matter
[52:41] and this most important event
[52:44] is
[52:45] the most thoroughly vindicated
[52:48] with the most evidence for this even in
[52:50] the
[52:51] the the history of the church a lot of
[52:54] the the different um stories in the
[52:56] bible maybe there's questions that
[52:58] happened this way did it happen this way
[52:59] was it a parable was it did it really
[53:02] happen was it a fish was it a whale
[53:05] easter
[53:06] either jesus christ raised from the dead
[53:09] or he didn't
[53:12] and we have a number of apostles
[53:16] that each
[53:17] voted with their life they each gave the
[53:19] last full measure of devotion
[53:21] they said heroes
[53:23] it was real
[53:25] i'm a
[53:26] witness and then we've got all through
[53:29] history of the church
[53:31] these men these women these gallant
[53:32] souls
[53:34] that were so convinced that this
[53:37] was literally true
[53:39] that they would
[53:41] seal their testimony with their lives
[53:46] it's powerful
[53:50] and so this is a beautiful day
[53:54] but
[53:55] it's a day of sorrow
[53:58] if you're not a part of it
[54:00] jesus said because i live you live also
[54:04] if he came and he gave his life for you
[54:08] and he rose again
[54:10] that you could rise again
[54:12] that you could be part of this
[54:13] resurrection
[54:16] and you let that opportunity pass by
[54:20] what a sorrowful thing
[54:23] it'd be
[54:25] it'd be better had you never been born
[54:28] if you were to miss this
[54:29] so the question is
[54:31] am i part of this
[54:33] am i risen this morning am i alive
[54:37] and
[54:39] and a lot of times we we like peter
[54:43] we're looking at jesus we see his
[54:45] resurrection we see easter resurrection
[54:47] morning
[54:49] and we're so happy oh lord let me walk
[54:51] on the water with you
[54:52] and we start our christian walk
[54:55] and as we're walking
[54:57] we look to the left and we look to the
[54:59] right
[55:00] and we can get so discouraged
[55:02] look at myself and
[55:04] i know myself better than i know any of
[55:06] you and it's discouraging
[55:08] but maybe you'd look at yourself you'd
[55:10] also be discouraged
[55:12] a lot of things and i think really if
[55:13] you if you were to know all the
[55:17] all the
[55:18] inner workings of any of our hearts
[55:20] even somebody that you hold in very high
[55:22] esteem
[55:24] you could get discouraged
[55:26] you could say ah
[55:27] i thought we were part of this
[55:29] i thought we had this promise i thought
[55:31] we we had this word that if that same
[55:33] spirit that raised christ from the dead
[55:36] dwell in me it'll quicken my mortal body
[55:38] where is that
[55:39] why am i still
[55:42] so human
[55:44] why am i still so dead
[55:47] what's going on here
[55:49] right
[55:52] so that let me
[55:54] go back to genesis
[55:58] what is
[55:59] this
[56:01] dying and raising
[56:04] you can compare this to the parable
[56:06] jesus talks in parables
[56:08] he has this parable where
[56:10] these valuable talents are given to
[56:12] entrusted to different men
[56:15] and the foolish of the three is he
[56:17] who hides it in the ground
[56:19] and pulls it up again
[56:23] what more valuable thing is there in
[56:25] this world than the only begotten son of
[56:27] god
[56:29] so how do these line up
[56:31] how is this not just
[56:33] the foolish
[56:34] servant that hid this in the ground and
[56:36] pulled it up again
[56:37] there must be a difference
[56:39] right
[56:40] well of all the things that you can put
[56:42] in the ground
[56:44] you can put gold in the ground
[56:47] all sorts of different things
[56:50] there's only one thing
[56:52] that's not a total waste
[56:54] to put in the ground
[56:56] a seed
[57:00] god's plan for resurrection was never a
[57:02] single son to be raised
[57:05] but that there would be many sons
[57:06] brought to glory that he's the captain
[57:09] that he's like it says in revelation
[57:11] that he's the first begotten of the dead
[57:15] like it's talking about in psalms
[57:19] this this man this blessed man we read
[57:22] these these
[57:23] encouragements and psalms
[57:26] unfortunately so many of them are
[57:28] qualified
[57:29] on the man being righteous
[57:32] and i can never reach that in myself
[57:35] so a lot of times we try to read these
[57:37] as pertaining directly to ourselves
[57:40] it doesn't work
[57:41] but that's writing about christ
[57:44] he is that perfect man whose delight is
[57:46] in the law of the lord right
[57:48] he's that one and if we're in him then
[57:50] we do qualify through him
[57:52] see and it talks about him bringing
[57:55] forth his seed
[57:57] in season
[57:59] that's the way of seeds
[58:01] is that there's a season there's a time
[58:04] saturday night right even pre-dawn on
[58:08] sunday easter resurrection day
[58:11] if you were to go there and you'd open
[58:13] up the tomb
[58:14] you would be so discouraged
[58:17] this is the day this is the third day
[58:20] oh but there was a rising of the sun
[58:23] in the perfect time
[58:25] in god's
[58:27] appointed season
[58:29] and so is it with you and i church
[58:33] we've got a promise
[58:35] we've got a down payment we've got an
[58:37] earnest
[58:38] we've got that
[58:40] gift of a conscience
[58:42] that tells us when we need to repent
[58:44] it tells us when we need to go and make
[58:46] things right
[58:49] just like
[58:50] mary
[58:52] she received she saw this angel and she
[58:54] was told
[58:56] you're gonna receive this
[58:58] this christ
[59:01] it took
[59:02] about nine months
[59:04] it took time
[59:06] the law of the seed
[59:09] that's why we have
[59:11] good friday that's why we have saturday
[59:14] that's why we have this pre-dawn
[59:16] on resurrection sunday
[59:19] is because everything has a time
[59:21] everything there's a time and a season
[59:25] so don't be discouraged
[59:27] when you look at yourself
[59:29] look to calvary look and live keep your
[59:31] eyes fixed on jesus
[59:34] when we start to sink in the water his
[59:35] arm is there to hold us up
[59:37] righteous man falls seven times and
[59:39] rises again
[59:42] to this easter morning
[59:44] don't be discouraged when you look at
[59:46] yourself
[59:47] just look away to jesus and say i
[59:49] believe lord be it unto me according to
[59:51] your word
[59:53] i receive
[59:54] he's that corn of wheat
[59:56] that fell into the ground and died
[59:59] that would not abide alone but that it
[1:00:01] would bring forth much fruit
[1:00:03] so now this is the test in time
[1:00:06] not of you and i
[1:00:08] but it's the testing time of that seed
[1:00:11] that fell into the ground
[1:00:12] that if that was the real seed
[1:00:15] it will bring forth many fold
[1:00:18] god was not the foolish
[1:00:20] servant in the parable of the talent he
[1:00:22] knew what he was doing when he planted
[1:00:24] that seed at calvary
[1:00:26] he knew that though it would be bleak
[1:00:28] for a long time
[1:00:29] and though it would look like
[1:00:32] a failure
[1:00:34] that in his time
[1:00:36] he makes all things beautiful
[1:00:38] he's watching you and i
[1:00:40] amen
[1:00:42] oh i'm so happy
[1:00:46] he's the first fruits of them that slept
[1:00:50] it says
[1:00:53] it says in first corinthians 15
[1:00:56] and
[1:00:58] 20
[1:01:00] it says but now is christ risen from the
[1:01:02] dead
[1:01:03] and become the first fruits of them that
[1:01:04] slept
[1:01:06] for since by man came death
[1:01:08] a man came also the resurrection of the
[1:01:10] dead for as an adam
[1:01:12] all die even so in christ shall all be
[1:01:15] made alive
[1:01:16] but every man in his own order
[1:01:18] there's a time for each of us
[1:01:21] some of us
[1:01:23] we'll go the way of the grave
[1:01:25] like our sister joyce
[1:01:27] some of us
[1:01:28] will be alive and remain
[1:01:31] but god has a time
[1:01:33] that each of us
[1:01:35] we're part of that resurrection
[1:01:37] but we don't have the full manifestation
[1:01:39] of that
[1:01:40] it says if that spirit that raised
[1:01:42] christ and the dead dwell in you it will
[1:01:44] quicken your mortal body
[1:01:48] we have part of that fulfilled part of
[1:01:49] that is to be fulfilled part of that
[1:01:52] we're waiting on part of that we've got
[1:01:54] this earnest expectation of the creature
[1:01:56] this creation that's groaning waiting
[1:01:58] for this manifestation of you and i
[1:02:02] proof that that seed was the real seed
[1:02:06] it's not approving of us it's approving
[1:02:07] of that seed
[1:02:09] and i believe that he was what he said
[1:02:10] he was i believe he was that corn of
[1:02:13] wheat
[1:02:14] that's going to bring forth that same
[1:02:15] life that same power that same dynamite
[1:02:18] this is not a gospel and word only but
[1:02:20] this is the gospel and power and
[1:02:21] manifestation of the holy ghost
[1:02:23] this is the
[1:02:25] the gospel
[1:02:27] that will raise the dead you know god
[1:02:29] it's the gospel to raise this dead man
[1:02:30] in the newness of life
[1:02:32] if i'll just hold to the promise
[1:02:34] amen i've i've used all my time but as
[1:02:37] we finish
[1:02:38] let's
[1:02:39] um
[1:02:41] i had a lot of other stuff you know
[1:02:42] arise
[1:02:43] shine
[1:02:44] thy light has come
[1:02:48] it's very soon
[1:02:50] we don't want to just say well you know
[1:02:52] that's someday
[1:02:54] this is the season
[1:02:56] this i believe
[1:02:58] is
[1:02:59] is this time
[1:03:01] that there's been a midnight cry made
[1:03:04] behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out
[1:03:05] to meet him
[1:03:06] it says the virgins rose and they trim
[1:03:08] their lamps i believe that's the time
[1:03:11] we are there's a little more dying that
[1:03:13] we've got to do right when you trim your
[1:03:15] lamp you never end up more than you
[1:03:17] started
[1:03:18] you're cutting away of yourself you're
[1:03:20] cutting away the old burnt up
[1:03:22] parts that there can be a true light
[1:03:24] shine in this last stage
[1:03:26] that's the time we're living in
[1:03:29] it said he said if i be lifted up i'll
[1:03:31] draw all men to me
[1:03:33] that was
[1:03:34] him rising on
[1:03:35] on the cross and crucifixion
[1:03:38] we're to follow him
[1:03:40] we're just walking that same path if
[1:03:43] we're to share that same resurrection we
[1:03:45] share
[1:03:46] in in the same
[1:03:48] death
[1:03:49] that we deny ourselves we take up our
[1:03:50] cross daily and we follow him
[1:03:53] so
[1:03:54] we're looking to be risen with him
[1:03:57] let's
[1:03:58] not be discouraged but let's just say
[1:04:00] where can i trim my lamp
[1:04:02] where can i take up my cross
[1:04:04] where can i
[1:04:06] follow after him you know when jesus
[1:04:07] called the disciples he said follow me
[1:04:10] and of course okay yeah this this looks
[1:04:12] like fun
[1:04:14] after the crucifixion
[1:04:16] he says to peter second time
[1:04:19] now that you know where i'm going peter
[1:04:22] follow me
[1:04:24] will you follow him i'll go with him to
[1:04:27] the judgment no i'll go with him
[1:04:29] all the way
[1:04:31] but though it'd be dark weeping may
[1:04:33] endure for the night
[1:04:34] joy comes for the more in the morning
[1:04:36] if we'll
[1:04:38] if we'll not be weary in well-doing in
[1:04:40] due season we will reap
[1:04:43] if we faint not
[1:04:44] as uh as our musicians will come let's
[1:04:46] let's just finish
[1:04:48] in ephesians chapter five
[1:04:50] i just want to read this final
[1:04:52] encouragement to you ephesians 5 and
[1:04:54] we'll read 8-21
[1:04:57] it says
[1:04:58] for you were sometimes darkness
[1:05:02] saturday
[1:05:03] freed on sunday morning but now are you
[1:05:05] light in the lord walk as children of
[1:05:07] the light of light
[1:05:09] for the fruit of the spirit is in all
[1:05:10] goodness and righteousness and the truth
[1:05:13] proving what is acceptable unto the lord
[1:05:15] and have no fellowship with the
[1:05:16] unfruitful works of darkness but rather
[1:05:18] reprove them let's trim those lamps
[1:05:20] for it is a shame even to speak of those
[1:05:22] things which are done of them in secret
[1:05:24] but all things that are approved and
[1:05:25] made manifest by the light for where
[1:05:28] whatsoever thou doest is manifest in
[1:05:30] light wherefore he saith
[1:05:32] awake thou that sleepest
[1:05:34] let's let's be risen with him
[1:05:36] let's rise up
[1:05:38] let's wake up
[1:05:42] awake thou that sleepless arise from the
[1:05:44] dead and christ shall give thee life
[1:05:47] light
[1:05:48] see then that thou walk circumspectly
[1:05:50] not as fools but as wise
[1:05:52] redeeming the time for the days are evil
[1:05:54] wherefore be not unwise but
[1:05:56] understanding what the will of the lord
[1:05:58] is and be not drunk with wine where in
[1:06:00] his excess but be filled with the spirit
[1:06:03] that's a that's for you that's for you
[1:06:04] to fulfill
[1:06:05] say be it unto me
[1:06:08] i'll be filled with the spirit
[1:06:10] speaking to yourselves in psalms and him
[1:06:12] hymns and spiritual songs singing and
[1:06:14] making melody in your heart to the lord
[1:06:17] giving thanks always in all things unto
[1:06:19] god and the father in the name of our
[1:06:21] lord jesus christ
[1:06:23] submitting yourselves one to another in
[1:06:25] the fear of god god bless you church
[1:06:27] i pray you're encouraged and as a
[1:06:29] brother jordan will come and sing a song

[1:09:02] day
[1:09:04] thank you
[1:09:07] he has risen
[1:09:11] such a day i i should sit down after
[1:09:13] what we've heard this morning
[1:09:15] i'm full
[1:09:16] i'm full
[1:09:18] our topic
[1:09:22] taken
[1:09:23] from the gospel accounts of easter
[1:09:26] is humility
[1:09:28] perhaps a little unusual
[1:09:31] well let's stand and you're already
[1:09:33] standing as you read the first
[1:09:35] verses this morning consider this
[1:09:37] question
[1:09:39] who was the greatest disciple
[1:09:42] on that easter day
[1:09:44] the 12 discussed and argued about who is
[1:09:46] the greatest throughout jesus ministry
[1:09:49] for example shortly after the experience
[1:09:51] we call the transfiguration matthew
[1:09:53] tells us
[1:09:55] at the same time
[1:09:56] came the disciples unto jesus saying
[1:10:00] who's the greatest in the kingdom of
[1:10:01] heaven well there's three of us and
[1:10:03] those other nine are down in the hill
[1:10:05] somewhere which one of us might it be
[1:10:07] these are real people
[1:10:09] they're just like us
[1:10:10] struggles competition
[1:10:12] right issues of trust
[1:10:15] how did jesus answer them jesus called a
[1:10:17] little child unto them and said him in
[1:10:19] the midst of them and said
[1:10:22] verily
[1:10:23] i say to you
[1:10:25] except you be converted
[1:10:27] guys you've got to change and become as
[1:10:30] little children
[1:10:32] you'll not even enter into the kingdom
[1:10:34] of heaven
[1:10:36] whosoever therefore
[1:10:38] shall humble himself
[1:10:40] as this little child the same is the
[1:10:44] greatest
[1:10:45] in the kingdom of heaven
[1:10:48] please be seated
[1:10:51] we see from this scripture that humility
[1:10:54] is an important attribute of greatness
[1:10:57] in god's eyes
[1:10:59] a while later james and john the sons of
[1:11:02] zebedee came to jesus
[1:11:04] along with her mom according to matthew
[1:11:06] they wanted as much influence as they
[1:11:07] could get here
[1:11:09] why they were seeking an advantage and
[1:11:12] they were acting like little kids
[1:11:14] promise me you'll do what i ask before i
[1:11:16] ask okay
[1:11:18] did you ever try that one on your
[1:11:19] parents
[1:11:21] i did
[1:11:22] not very successfully
[1:11:24] mark relates the incident this way
[1:11:26] james and john the sons of zebedee jesus
[1:11:30] nicknamed them bernaderus the sons of
[1:11:32] thunder
[1:11:34] came unto jesus saying
[1:11:36] teacher
[1:11:37] we would that thou should just do for us
[1:11:38] whatever we shall desire
[1:11:41] say okay please no how about pretty
[1:11:44] please
[1:11:45] no no and and jesus said to them
[1:11:48] what do you guys want
[1:11:52] ask me first and then i'll tell you i
[1:11:54] wasn't born yesterday
[1:11:58] and james and john said to jesus
[1:12:01] grant unto us that we may sit
[1:12:05] one on that right hand one on the left
[1:12:07] we'll sort out which is which a little
[1:12:08] later
[1:12:09] when you enter thy glory
[1:12:12] we want the best seats in the house
[1:12:14] we want recognition
[1:12:16] we want power
[1:12:18] we're your guys it's not pete and those
[1:12:21] other guys down there
[1:12:23] well are you ready for a shock
[1:12:25] verse 41 when the ten heard it they
[1:12:28] began to be much displeased with james
[1:12:30] and john
[1:12:31] okay not a shock right they're real
[1:12:33] people they're just like you and me
[1:12:35] certainly they're like me
[1:12:38] later
[1:12:39] jesus is talking about greatness
[1:12:42] and he talks about how to achieve it
[1:12:44] matthew tells us
[1:12:47] but he that is greatest among you shall
[1:12:50] be your servant
[1:12:52] your attendant
[1:12:53] your waiter
[1:12:55] and whosoever shall exalt himself
[1:12:58] shall be abased
[1:13:00] he that shall humble himself
[1:13:03] shall be exalted
[1:13:05] well did the disciples learn the lesson
[1:13:08] jesus repeated it several times he said
[1:13:10] it over and over
[1:13:12] and over
[1:13:14] well let's look at their final meal
[1:13:15] together they've been together for
[1:13:18] some three plus years
[1:13:21] they're observing the passover
[1:13:23] very solemn time
[1:13:26] celebrating
[1:13:27] redemption released from slavery in
[1:13:29] egypt
[1:13:30] at a time we call the last supper
[1:13:33] jesus had told him i've desired with a
[1:13:35] great desire to have this meal with you
[1:13:38] and as he's with them he's just
[1:13:40] disclosed to them
[1:13:42] that he's being betrayed
[1:13:45] what a sober
[1:13:46] moment
[1:13:48] when they heard that were they thinking
[1:13:50] of jesus
[1:13:52] were they thinking of the implications
[1:13:54] of what he had just told them
[1:13:57] well let's listen in this time we'll let
[1:14:00] luke give us the details
[1:14:03] it says and jesus took bread
[1:14:06] and gave thanks and break it and it was
[1:14:08] monsters it was passover
[1:14:11] he broke the bread at says as we just
[1:14:14] heard it wasn't tearing a loaf of bread
[1:14:16] he
[1:14:17] broke bread
[1:14:19] i kept it in a plastic bag i don't want
[1:14:21] crumbs on the pulpit right
[1:14:27] and he'd break it and gave unto the
[1:14:28] gathered disciples he said this is my
[1:14:31] body
[1:14:31] which is given for you this do
[1:14:34] in remembrance of me we're remembering
[1:14:36] egypt do it now in remembrance of me
[1:14:39] and likewise the cup also after supper
[1:14:42] was the third of the four cups the cup
[1:14:44] of redemption
[1:14:47] he said this cup
[1:14:50] is the new testament in my blood
[1:14:52] which is shed for you
[1:14:56] but behold
[1:14:57] the hand of him that betrays me is with
[1:15:00] me on the table
[1:15:02] truly the son of man goes as it was
[1:15:04] determined but woe
[1:15:06] unto that man
[1:15:07] by whom he is betrayed
[1:15:10] and they looked at each other began to
[1:15:12] inquire among themselves which of them
[1:15:14] that would do this thing
[1:15:17] well this discussion eventually subsides
[1:15:20] well what's the next hot topic that they
[1:15:22] discuss at this last supper
[1:15:26] we read in john several chapters of of
[1:15:28] his final words and instructions to
[1:15:30] these people he had spent the last years
[1:15:33] of his life with instructing and
[1:15:35] teaching and demonstrating
[1:15:38] but i wonder if they were really paying
[1:15:40] attention that night
[1:15:41] because the very next verse in luke
[1:15:45] when jesus has just shocked them
[1:15:48] after he's told them how desperately he
[1:15:50] longed to be with them what do they do
[1:15:53] there was also a strife an argument
[1:15:55] among them
[1:15:56] they fought about which of them should
[1:15:58] be accounted the greatest
[1:16:01] these guys never gave up
[1:16:03] each wanting to be the one in charge of
[1:16:06] the rest
[1:16:08] so given all this
[1:16:11] who do you think had one of the greatest
[1:16:12] honors
[1:16:14] ever bestowed
[1:16:15] on any of the disciples on any human
[1:16:18] being
[1:16:19] in human history
[1:16:21] for that matter
[1:16:23] let's consider these disciples for for
[1:16:25] just a moment
[1:16:27] their background their context of all
[1:16:28] this the celebration of passover is
[1:16:31] related to moses the mightiest prophet
[1:16:33] that had ever lived with a mighty arm
[1:16:36] astonishing miracles he took them out of
[1:16:38] slavery defeated the biggest army on the
[1:16:40] planet
[1:16:41] and brought them the word
[1:16:44] and not just spoke it he was the first
[1:16:46] one that wrote it
[1:16:48] he wrote it in great detail they had
[1:16:51] they had thus saith the lord they had
[1:16:54] the word
[1:16:55] they had it
[1:16:57] god spoke to him lip to ear
[1:17:00] for the next 1500 years
[1:17:02] people spent their lives studying every
[1:17:06] word that was written
[1:17:08] talk about using quotes in a sermon
[1:17:10] these guys had it down to a science
[1:17:12] they didn't have
[1:17:14] ipads and things to refer to
[1:17:17] they had it all
[1:17:21] so when jesus called his students his
[1:17:24] disciples who did he call
[1:17:27] the rabbis
[1:17:28] the priests the ones who had immersed
[1:17:31] themselves in the word of god
[1:17:34] no
[1:17:35] he called fishermen
[1:17:37] revolutionaries
[1:17:39] collaborators with the roman occupiers
[1:17:44] men who we see later are attempting
[1:17:45] tricks arguing trying to get the most
[1:17:48] prestigious assignments the highest
[1:17:50] honor
[1:17:51] in other words
[1:17:52] people
[1:17:53] like you like me
[1:17:56] and these people these guys they were
[1:17:58] overlooking the very example of humility
[1:18:01] that jesus lived before them
[1:18:04] every day
[1:18:05] for years
[1:18:08] if the resurrection were to happen today
[1:18:12] who do you think would see it first
[1:18:15] who would report it
[1:18:17] well
[1:18:18] let's look to easter for an example
[1:18:21] it wasn't peter
[1:18:23] no you remember he's what blessed art
[1:18:25] thou simon barjona
[1:18:27] flesh and blood has to reveal this to
[1:18:29] you but my father which is heaven on
[1:18:30] this rock of revelation you've got it
[1:18:32] peter
[1:18:33] no no
[1:18:35] it wasn't peter
[1:18:37] in fact he's the example of pride that
[1:18:40] comes before the fall he told jesus that
[1:18:42] night i'd die for you and a few hours
[1:18:45] later
[1:18:46] he was denying he even knew him
[1:18:49] no
[1:18:49] and it wasn't james or john the other
[1:18:52] two that were present at the
[1:18:53] transfiguration
[1:18:55] who was the greatest who would you have
[1:18:56] picked
[1:18:58] who would you have picked to be the
[1:19:00] first witness to the greatest event
[1:19:02] known to have happened in all of human
[1:19:05] history
[1:19:07] it wasn't even one of jesus hand-picked
[1:19:09] twelve
[1:19:10] but it was a special disciple
[1:19:12] nonetheless one that had been possessed
[1:19:15] of seven demons
[1:19:17] mary magdalene
[1:19:22] we read in luke it came to pass
[1:19:23] afterward this is early in jesus
[1:19:25] ministry jesus went throughout every
[1:19:28] city and village preaching and showing
[1:19:30] the glad tidings of the kingdom of god
[1:19:32] the 12 were with him
[1:19:34] and certain women were also with him
[1:19:39] these women had been healed
[1:19:42] of evil spirits
[1:19:44] and infirmities
[1:19:46] they were just like us they were broken
[1:19:51] mary called magdalen
[1:19:53] out of whom went seven devils seven evil
[1:19:55] spirits
[1:19:56] joanna the wife of whoso herod steward
[1:19:59] susannah many others
[1:20:02] which ministered unto him
[1:20:04] of their substance
[1:20:06] we see jesus ministry receive support
[1:20:09] from these women and that they had all
[1:20:10] received healing
[1:20:12] or deliverance
[1:20:14] through that ministry
[1:20:16] now mary magdalene wasn't just present
[1:20:18] during his ministry she was present at
[1:20:20] the crucifixion we read in the gospel of
[1:20:22] mark
[1:20:23] there were also women looking on afar
[1:20:25] off among whom was mary magdalene mary
[1:20:28] the mother of james the less and moses
[1:20:30] and solomay who also when he was in
[1:20:33] galilee followed him
[1:20:36] ministered unto him
[1:20:38] and many other women which came up with
[1:20:39] him unto jerusalem
[1:20:43] well that easter morning
[1:20:45] john relates that
[1:20:47] she was the first to go to the tomb
[1:20:50] alone
[1:20:51] before sunrise john 20 verse 1 we read
[1:20:54] the first day of the week
[1:20:56] cometh mary magdalene early
[1:20:59] when it was yet dark
[1:21:01] under the sepulcher and and sees the
[1:21:03] stone taken away from this replica
[1:21:05] here's mary
[1:21:06] she's alone
[1:21:08] this is a city that's crowded with
[1:21:10] pilgrims there's thousands upon
[1:21:11] thousands of extra people
[1:21:13] just packing the place so you can be
[1:21:15] sure there were pickpockets and
[1:21:17] other people that were looking for
[1:21:18] opportunities
[1:21:20] and here's this woman
[1:21:21] in the dark before dawn by herself
[1:21:24] venturing outside the city
[1:21:27] why she doesn't have anointing spices
[1:21:29] with her
[1:21:30] she has nothing with her she has no one
[1:21:32] with her
[1:21:33] maybe she's wondering is it true
[1:21:36] is it true
[1:21:39] but she sees that stone rolled away and
[1:21:41] what happens well she kind of carefully
[1:21:44] saunters away no no she runs
[1:21:47] comes to simon peter and and to john and
[1:21:49] says to them
[1:21:51] they've taken away the lure the the
[1:21:53] stone's been displaced what's going on
[1:21:56] we don't know where they've laid him
[1:21:58] she doesn't know yet
[1:22:00] that he's risen
[1:22:02] maybe some of the soldiers guarding the
[1:22:03] tomb stole the body or what's going on
[1:22:05] she seeks help
[1:22:07] so peter therefore went forth and and
[1:22:09] that other disciple john and they came
[1:22:11] to the sepulcher
[1:22:13] now up to this point
[1:22:15] no one had gone inside
[1:22:17] we have no information how mary peter
[1:22:20] and john got past the guards
[1:22:22] we don't even know if the guards were
[1:22:23] close enough to have noticed that the
[1:22:24] stone had moved
[1:22:26] it was dark
[1:22:28] but it's the sort of darkness that
[1:22:29] exists under a full moon i was up about
[1:22:31] three this morning and outside looking
[1:22:33] at the light from the moon
[1:22:36] don't ask me why
[1:22:38] but perhaps this day it was cloudy
[1:22:41] maybe mary and the two men carry a lamp
[1:22:43] or something we don't know but it says
[1:22:45] they both ran together
[1:22:47] oh they're charging down and here's poor
[1:22:49] mary running what's going on what's
[1:22:52] going on
[1:22:56] and john outran peter got there first
[1:22:59] and john stooping down and looking in
[1:23:01] saw the linen clothes lying but he
[1:23:03] didn't go inside
[1:23:05] then simon peter followed him and he
[1:23:07] went into the sepulcher and sees the
[1:23:10] linen clothes lying and the next few
[1:23:11] verses tell us that that they saw the
[1:23:13] grave clothes they saw the linen they
[1:23:15] sold the nap
[1:23:16] they didn't see jesus
[1:23:18] they didn't see a body
[1:23:20] they didn't see angels
[1:23:23] they didn't see anything like that so
[1:23:24] what happened
[1:23:26] they left
[1:23:28] they went back
[1:23:33] but
[1:23:35] john tells us that mary was the first to
[1:23:37] the tomb
[1:23:38] but mark
[1:23:39] tells us that she was the first to see
[1:23:42] the risen jesus in mark 16 9 we read now
[1:23:45] when jesus was risen early the first day
[1:23:47] of the week
[1:23:48] he appeared
[1:23:50] first
[1:23:51] to mary magdalene
[1:23:53] out of whom he had cast seven devils
[1:23:56] seven devils
[1:23:58] well let's go back to john again let's
[1:24:00] get some details we'll pick up right
[1:24:01] where we left off where where peter and
[1:24:03] john had left the tomb and left mary
[1:24:04] behind
[1:24:06] john 20 11
[1:24:09] says mary stood outside the sepulcher
[1:24:13] crying
[1:24:15] a lot of help peter and john were they
[1:24:17] ran ahead of her to the tomb
[1:24:19] now they left her
[1:24:21] vulnerable
[1:24:22] by herself
[1:24:24] and as she wept
[1:24:26] in her grief
[1:24:28] she stooped down
[1:24:31] she looked into the sepulcher
[1:24:34] and saw two angels in white sitting one
[1:24:37] at the head other at the feet where the
[1:24:39] body of jesus had laid
[1:24:42] how did these guys get there
[1:24:44] how did they get past mary she was just
[1:24:46] outside the door the whole time
[1:24:48] and they said to her
[1:24:52] woman
[1:24:56] why are you crying
[1:24:59] she didn't scream
[1:25:01] she didn't ask them how they snuck past
[1:25:03] her to get inside
[1:25:05] every other time almost in the bible
[1:25:07] when an angel appears to somebody
[1:25:09] they're afraid and the first thing the
[1:25:10] angels say is fear not
[1:25:13] she's too distraught she's too upset
[1:25:15] she's too whatever
[1:25:17] she's not frightened they don't have to
[1:25:18] say fear not
[1:25:20] they don't have to say that they get
[1:25:21] right to the heart of the matter
[1:25:23] you're so sad
[1:25:26] this is the greatest
[1:25:27] day of the year that's ever happened
[1:25:30] why are you so sad why are you crying
[1:25:34] and mary says to them
[1:25:37] they've taken away my lord i
[1:25:39] i don't know where they've laid him
[1:25:43] and when she said this
[1:25:45] she turned herself back
[1:25:48] and saw jesus
[1:25:50] standing
[1:25:52] she didn't recognize him she didn't know
[1:25:54] it was jesus
[1:25:56] and jesus says to the same thing the
[1:25:57] angel said
[1:25:59] woman
[1:26:01] why are you crying
[1:26:03] are you looking for someone
[1:26:07] she thinking maybe he's the gardener she
[1:26:10] said unto him sir
[1:26:12] if
[1:26:13] if you've taken him
[1:26:15] tell me where you put him and i'll go
[1:26:17] get him
[1:26:20] and what happens jesus says to her
[1:26:25] oh mary
[1:26:28] she turned herself and looked at him
[1:26:31] and she said it says she says
[1:26:35] my teacher
[1:26:38] she didn't say rabonai she didn't say my
[1:26:41] teacher no
[1:26:43] no
[1:26:44] she says rabona my master
[1:26:47] not just master my master my teacher
[1:26:51] didn't jesus say my sheep know my voice
[1:26:56] they come when i call he called her name
[1:26:59] jesus said to her don't touch me mary
[1:27:02] i'm not yet ascended to my father
[1:27:04] but go to my brethren
[1:27:06] jesus is giving her a commandment
[1:27:09] giving her instruction
[1:27:11] go to my brethren and say to them
[1:27:13] i ascend to my father and to your father
[1:27:16] to my god and to your god
[1:27:19] and now we get to the heart of the
[1:27:21] matter for our brief lesson this morning
[1:27:23] the risen jesus has given mary a
[1:27:25] directive
[1:27:27] she has thus saith the lord
[1:27:30] to tell the other disciples
[1:27:33] so mary magdalene obediently
[1:27:36] excitedly
[1:27:38] joyfully
[1:27:40] came and told the disciples i've seen
[1:27:42] the lord
[1:27:44] and he had spoken these things unto her
[1:27:46] as a faithful witness
[1:27:47] excited to share
[1:27:49] not just good news
[1:27:51] wonderful news
[1:27:53] incredible news
[1:27:56] mark tells us how her testimony was
[1:27:58] received
[1:28:00] go to mark 16 verse 10 she went and told
[1:28:03] them that had been with him as they
[1:28:05] mourned and wept
[1:28:08] and they when they had heard from mary
[1:28:10] magdalene that that jesus was alive and
[1:28:13] had been seen of her
[1:28:15] oh mary
[1:28:16] you're crazy
[1:28:19] no
[1:28:20] john my says they believe not john my
[1:28:22] said look mary
[1:28:24] calm down peter and i were there
[1:28:26] it's just an empty tomb with some grave
[1:28:28] clothes inside
[1:28:30] there's no angels there we were we were
[1:28:32] there there are soldiers outside not a
[1:28:34] gardener you're beside yourself mary
[1:28:37] just just calm down
[1:28:39] one of the others might have said
[1:28:41] have a cup of tea dear
[1:28:43] it'll settle your nerves
[1:28:45] we can imagine the conversations that
[1:28:47] they might have had
[1:28:49] luke tells us
[1:28:51] that to the eleven
[1:28:52] along with the others gathered there
[1:28:54] that that this and other testimonies
[1:28:56] seemed as idle tales
[1:29:00] you're just making this up
[1:29:02] yet mary magdalene was the first to see
[1:29:06] jesus
[1:29:07] and was a faithful witness to the
[1:29:09] incredible encounter she had
[1:29:12] she'd been with the disciples for years
[1:29:14] walked the same dusty galilean roads
[1:29:17] with them
[1:29:18] had endured the same ridicule and
[1:29:20] undoubtedly gossip though there's that
[1:29:22] traveling with those guys
[1:29:26] she'd helped with financial support
[1:29:28] in spite of all this
[1:29:31] they didn't believe her
[1:29:33] she wasn't a contender certainly in
[1:29:35] their eyes for the greatest disciple on
[1:29:37] that easter morning
[1:29:39] surely jesus would have appeared and
[1:29:40] spoken to peter or john when they were
[1:29:42] at the tomb
[1:29:44] but our subject this morning
[1:29:46] is humility
[1:29:48] as a lesson
[1:29:49] from the easter experience
[1:29:52] so let's see what happens shortly after
[1:29:54] her testimony and the supporting
[1:29:56] testimony of other women who had
[1:29:58] arrived after that first encounter we'll
[1:30:01] skip to verse 14 as we close
[1:30:05] mark 16 14
[1:30:07] afterward
[1:30:08] jesus appeared unto the eleven as they
[1:30:10] sat at meat
[1:30:12] and jesus upbraided them with their
[1:30:14] unbelief and hardness of heart
[1:30:17] because they believed not them which had
[1:30:19] seen him after he was risen
[1:30:23] jesus upbraided his disciples
[1:30:26] for their unbelief
[1:30:28] he said they were hard-hearted
[1:30:31] now upbraided so where you can just read
[1:30:33] that right it's king james english bread
[1:30:36] yeah he just scolded him a little bit no
[1:30:37] no the greek word means to defame
[1:30:41] to rail at
[1:30:43] to chide
[1:30:45] to taunt
[1:30:46] cast in their teeth
[1:30:49] reproach
[1:30:50] revile
[1:30:52] afraid
[1:30:54] jesus was not very happy with these guys
[1:30:58] but are you ready for the very next
[1:31:00] verse up until now marcus told us the
[1:31:03] context and said this is the stuff that
[1:31:05] jesus
[1:31:06] scolded them right but now he goes to
[1:31:08] repeating jesus very next words
[1:31:12] and he said to them
[1:31:14] go he into all the world and preach the
[1:31:17] gospel to every creature
[1:31:20] now he's commanded them
[1:31:22] to be witnesses
[1:31:24] just like he commanded mary
[1:31:26] outside the tomb the disciples had just
[1:31:29] heard a true and faithful witness a
[1:31:31] humble witness
[1:31:32] and they'd rejected
[1:31:34] her testimony
[1:31:36] jesus is saying see
[1:31:38] now it's your turn
[1:31:40] a reliable witness one you knew for
[1:31:42] years told you the truth
[1:31:45] she had thus saith the lord
[1:31:48] but you weren't prepared to hear it
[1:31:50] even though i told you many times at the
[1:31:52] event you refused to believe was going
[1:31:54] to happen i even told you that day it
[1:31:56] would happen
[1:31:58] and yet you rejected it
[1:32:01] so now
[1:32:02] you know how easy it is for someone to
[1:32:04] reject the truth
[1:32:06] armed with this experience i'm now
[1:32:09] sending you
[1:32:10] out into the world to be my witnesses
[1:32:12] just like i sent mary to you
[1:32:15] and now you'll be able to better
[1:32:16] understand
[1:32:18] when your witness is rejected
[1:32:20] the disciples had just received a very
[1:32:22] personal object lesson
[1:32:25] they would be scorned and rejected by
[1:32:26] many just as mary one of their own
[1:32:29] had been by them
[1:32:31] looked down upon
[1:32:33] ridiculed even
[1:32:35] we must be very very careful
[1:32:38] both to tell and to listen
[1:32:42] not to be discouraged when our witness
[1:32:43] is rejected or even scorned
[1:32:46] jesus reveals himself as he chooses
[1:32:50] to whom
[1:32:51] he chooses and through whom
[1:32:54] he chooses
[1:32:56] we must be careful that we're not too
[1:32:58] proud
[1:33:00] to receive truth from god
[1:33:02] by whatever humble means he may use to
[1:33:05] send it
[1:33:06] humility
[1:33:08] like that of jesus
[1:33:10] god bless you
[1:33:16] amen let's stand this morning
[1:33:19] daniel will come
[1:33:21] sing let your word be born in the manger
[1:33:23] of my heart amen
[1:33:25] let your word be born
[1:33:30] in the manger of my heart
[1:33:35] let it live in me
[1:33:38] let it start
[1:33:41] live inside this house of clay
[1:33:46] and mold me every day
[1:33:50] let your work be born
[1:33:54] in the manger
[1:33:56] of
[1:33:58] my heart
[1:34:01] it was a tiny simple stable
[1:34:05] all
[1:34:06] battered and warm
[1:34:10] hardly a place
[1:34:13] for a king to be born
[1:34:16] he didn't choose someplace special
[1:34:20] to reveal his majesty
[1:34:24] so i know if i'll give him control
[1:34:28] he'll be born in
[1:34:38] in the manger of my heart
[1:34:43] [Music]
[1:34:48] live inside this house of clay
[1:34:53] and mold me every day
[1:34:57] let your word
[1:35:00] [Music]
[1:35:08] well outwardly i'm nothing
[1:35:11] not much to behold
[1:35:16] hardly a place
[1:35:19] for his word to unfold
[1:35:22] but if i'll just yield my vessel
[1:35:26] and let him have his way
[1:35:30] from glory to unto glory
[1:35:33] he'll change me day by day
[1:35:37] [Music]
[1:35:53] live inside this house
[1:35:56] [Music]
[1:36:13] god bless you all
[1:36:15] i i don't have a scripture to to start
[1:36:17] out with i'll be reading a lot of them
[1:36:18] so you can go ahead and take your seats
[1:36:23] i thought the brothers did an absolutely
[1:36:25] outstanding job to this point brother
[1:36:27] aaron
[1:36:28] you really blessed me and what you said
[1:36:30] very very encouraging and
[1:36:32] and talking about saturday
[1:36:35] and applying these days to our lives
[1:36:38] very very very nice and brother peter i
[1:36:40] think that i'll never forget what you
[1:36:42] said
[1:36:43] god's plan
[1:36:44] was not for a single son to be raised
[1:36:48] but for many
[1:36:49] of us to be raised god bless you just
[1:36:52] just beautiful and and i really
[1:36:53] appreciate brother lyle and talking
[1:36:54] about
[1:36:56] um mary magdalene and
[1:36:58] if the lord's willing i'll talk a little
[1:36:59] bit about mary
[1:37:01] coming up
[1:37:02] i uh and following that i i was a bit
[1:37:05] nervous when i got up and and i got up
[1:37:07] to come into the minister's office and i
[1:37:09] walked into the closet
[1:37:11] right there
[1:37:13] so
[1:37:14] so have have patience with me
[1:37:20] was thinking if i would have got stuck
[1:37:21] in there i would have had to come out
[1:37:23] sometime
[1:37:25] but the word tells us to go into our
[1:37:27] closet and pray so i uh
[1:37:30] i'm i i'm not gonna hopefully do that
[1:37:33] again um
[1:37:35] you know today it is it's the
[1:37:37] celebration of really what is the
[1:37:39] greatest day in history
[1:37:41] and as the brothers have have laid the
[1:37:43] foundation that's why we're here
[1:37:46] and there's hundreds of millions of
[1:37:48] people today
[1:37:50] celebrating this same
[1:37:52] uh resurrection day that we are
[1:37:54] celebrating when we were driving here we
[1:37:57] saw a tent meeting over i think it was
[1:37:59] on miracle mile there with with uh a
[1:38:02] group of people and they were
[1:38:04] celebrating
[1:38:06] and
[1:38:07] you see the the churches the parking
[1:38:09] lots were filled up on this easter
[1:38:11] sunday and and as we were driving
[1:38:14] here i i was thinking i was thinking how
[1:38:18] many
[1:38:20] of these hundreds literally hundreds of
[1:38:22] millions of people
[1:38:24] that celebrate this greatest day
[1:38:27] in christianity how many people have
[1:38:30] this resurrection
[1:38:32] this resurrection experience this
[1:38:34] resurrection in their daily lives
[1:38:37] and it doesn't just affect their easter
[1:38:39] morning where we all we all get dressed
[1:38:42] in our in our best clothes on easter and
[1:38:44] and we get our families together and we
[1:38:46] we think on the resurrection of the lord
[1:38:49] but does it affect our daily lives
[1:38:53] this resurrection
[1:38:54] i have to i have to uh i'll tell another
[1:38:57] one on myself i was
[1:38:58] had a rough week at work and i was
[1:39:02] just down and some things happened that
[1:39:04] some of them were in my control and some
[1:39:06] of them weren't
[1:39:08] and
[1:39:09] i was worried about him and i was just
[1:39:11] worrying myself sick about some of the
[1:39:14] these these events that had happened in
[1:39:15] work and and then i was i was trying but
[1:39:18] aaron had mentioned that that i might be
[1:39:20] saying speaking
[1:39:22] on sunday morning so i started trying to
[1:39:24] put together some things to say and and
[1:39:27] and one of those things that i was
[1:39:29] thinking of is this resurrection this
[1:39:31] experience that happens and having this
[1:39:33] faith and i was i was starting to write
[1:39:35] down my notes and then i was worrying
[1:39:37] about work
[1:39:39] and writing down my notes and worrying
[1:39:40] about work and i said lord
[1:39:43] i'm doing exactly
[1:39:45] what i want to preach to the people not
[1:39:47] to do
[1:39:49] don't worry about all these things that
[1:39:52] are happening it may be work
[1:39:55] it may be our health it may be our
[1:39:57] children it may be a brother and it may
[1:39:59] be a sister but there is a resurrected
[1:40:02] jesus christ and he resurrected on this
[1:40:05] day 2000 years ago and that needs to be
[1:40:08] in our daily thoughts
[1:40:10] we need to always be thinking of that
[1:40:12] and that is a christian i say what man
[1:40:16] in this bible
[1:40:18] or what man have you ever met what
[1:40:20] pastor what prophet what preacher could
[1:40:22] ever say i'll lay my life down
[1:40:24] and i take it up again
[1:40:27] no one has ever said so such words in
[1:40:30] the history of man except for one man i
[1:40:32] think of sister douglas i was so blessed
[1:40:34] yesterday with uh as brother edd called
[1:40:37] it the celebration of life
[1:40:39] and it was it was really a blessing
[1:40:42] to be there and to hear um these these
[1:40:45] testimonies about our sister and what a
[1:40:47] christian that she was but even sister
[1:40:51] dougal even in this position that she is
[1:40:53] in right now on this sunday morning in
[1:40:56] the presence of the almighty god even
[1:40:58] she can't say
[1:41:00] that i will take my life back up again
[1:41:02] that was for one man
[1:41:04] that was for the man christ jesus and he
[1:41:07] is the reason
[1:41:09] for easter today
[1:41:12] i uh
[1:41:16] i wanted to read
[1:41:19] this scripture
[1:41:21] and brother aaron has already read it
[1:41:24] and it is a scripture that's probably
[1:41:26] read more than any other scripture
[1:41:29] in the history of this book
[1:41:33] and it's it's the very foundation of
[1:41:35] christianity
[1:41:37] and uh i can see
[1:41:40] sister angela's turning to john 3 16.
[1:41:44] i would guess um
[1:41:47] a powerful powerful scripture and it's
[1:41:50] probably the first one that we all
[1:41:51] memorize
[1:41:52] and it is but
[1:41:55] it talks about
[1:41:57] the very foundation of what we believe
[1:42:00] and even in the beginning
[1:42:02] of jesus's ministry john chapter 3
[1:42:05] he is already speaking of his death
[1:42:08] he's already speaking of this
[1:42:09] resurrection that's going to happen this
[1:42:11] this death dying for all of mankind
[1:42:15] and then being raised again let's turn
[1:42:18] there if you would to john chapter 3
[1:42:21] verse 16.
[1:42:24] oh yeah do you all drink out of this yet
[1:42:29] i'm just kidding
[1:42:31] john chapter
[1:42:33] chapter 3 verse 16.
[1:42:37] for god so loved the world
[1:42:39] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:42:41] whosoever believeth in him
[1:42:43] should not perish
[1:42:45] but have
[1:42:46] everlasting life
[1:42:48] if this book
[1:42:50] had just one sentence
[1:42:52] in it
[1:42:53] that would be enough for me
[1:42:55] just those one words just that one
[1:42:58] sentence
[1:42:59] that's written there what it means to me
[1:43:01] and what it means to every single
[1:43:03] christian
[1:43:04] but i want to tell you something brother
[1:43:06] aaron read it
[1:43:07] earlier there's a john 3 17
[1:43:12] and it says this
[1:43:15] for god sent not his son into the world
[1:43:17] to condemn
[1:43:19] the world
[1:43:22] but that the world through him
[1:43:25] might be saved
[1:43:28] god sent not his son to condemn the
[1:43:31] world
[1:43:33] now
[1:43:34] i want to bring this book
[1:43:36] right back down
[1:43:38] to us
[1:43:41] jesus promised gave us the promise
[1:43:43] in acts 2 38
[1:43:46] 239 that that if we are baptized that we
[1:43:50] have the promise to receive the holy
[1:43:52] spirit
[1:43:53] that holy spirit is the spirit of christ
[1:43:57] living in us
[1:43:59] it's it's something that we cannot speak
[1:44:01] enough about it is it is the greatest
[1:44:03] thing that we could ever achieve
[1:44:05] is to receive this holy spirit because
[1:44:07] we have that spirit of christ and let me
[1:44:09] read this again for god sent not his son
[1:44:12] into the world to condemn the world
[1:44:15] friends there is no condemnation
[1:44:18] in a christian
[1:44:20] as we
[1:44:21] have the spirit of christ we are not
[1:44:24] pointing fingers
[1:44:26] at each other
[1:44:28] we are not criticizing one another and
[1:44:31] if we do that that is not the spirit of
[1:44:35] christ
[1:44:36] that is the spirit of the other one this
[1:44:39] man called satan
[1:44:41] the spirit called satan
[1:44:43] this accuser
[1:44:46] that's his spirit so we need
[1:44:48] to be very very careful there and and
[1:44:52] since this this scripture is brought up
[1:44:54] so often i wanted to read it on this
[1:44:56] easter morning and and
[1:44:59] encourage us
[1:45:01] to do as jesus did and to have the same
[1:45:04] spirit that jesus had
[1:45:07] this lamb of god
[1:45:10] that took away the sins of the world on
[1:45:12] the cross
[1:45:14] the one that died on the cross and laid
[1:45:16] in the grave for three days was
[1:45:19] resurrected as i said by his own hand
[1:45:22] and who could say i lay down my life and
[1:45:24] i raise it up again only jesus christ
[1:45:27] let's turn to john chapter 10.
[1:45:32] verse 15.
[1:45:40] thank you my brother as the father
[1:45:42] knoweth me
[1:45:43] even so
[1:45:45] know i the father and i lay down my life
[1:45:48] for the sheep
[1:45:50] brother aaron i think it was you that
[1:45:51] was talking about the shepherd laying
[1:45:52] laying in the gate of the sheepfold it's
[1:45:55] a pen and this shepherd lays here in the
[1:45:56] gate so nothing can come in and out
[1:45:58] except it goes by the shepherd
[1:46:00] and jesus said i lay down my life
[1:46:04] for those that and there's you know that
[1:46:05] that's that is a wonderful aspect that's
[1:46:08] bravery that's that's compassion for one
[1:46:11] another but any of us could lay our
[1:46:13] lives down for one another
[1:46:15] we could lay our lives down for a cause
[1:46:17] as the as the
[1:46:19] the soldiers in ukraine and the people
[1:46:21] in ukraine are doing now
[1:46:23] they're laying down their lives for this
[1:46:26] cause of freedom
[1:46:28] that they that they have um brother
[1:46:31] aaron mentioned on winklart this morning
[1:46:33] the the swiss hero
[1:46:36] he laid down his life for switzerland
[1:46:39] this jesus laid his life down for us but
[1:46:42] he did something much more than that
[1:46:45] none of us
[1:46:46] could do as i said before what i'm about
[1:46:48] to read
[1:46:51] verse 16
[1:46:52] and other sheep i have which are not of
[1:46:54] this fold them also i must bring
[1:46:58] and they shall hear my voice
[1:47:02] and there
[1:47:03] shall be
[1:47:04] one fold
[1:47:06] and one shepherd
[1:47:10] no catholic no baptist
[1:47:13] no tapes only no fivefold
[1:47:17] no seven thunders no return ministry
[1:47:20] did i get everybody
[1:47:24] none of that
[1:47:26] one shepherd and one fault
[1:47:30] so so much so we're better than
[1:47:32] everybody else so much so much for a
[1:47:35] worthy elite we're we're much better
[1:47:38] than this other group oh we just know
[1:47:40] much more than they it is one god one
[1:47:43] jesus christ that saves us and only him
[1:47:47] now if we know more
[1:47:49] and we have been given a profit
[1:47:52] to reveal many of these mysteries that
[1:47:55] that have troubled us for so long
[1:47:58] then we're responsible for more
[1:48:01] but it does not make us any better
[1:48:03] friends not one bit there is one
[1:48:06] shepherd
[1:48:08] and we are celebrating his resurrection
[1:48:10] this morning
[1:48:16] verse 17.
[1:48:18] therefore doth my father love me because
[1:48:20] i lay down my life
[1:48:22] that i might take it
[1:48:24] again
[1:48:26] no man taketh it from me but i lay it
[1:48:28] down myself i love that part you know we
[1:48:32] we talk about we blame the jews and we
[1:48:34] blame pilate and they played a role but
[1:48:36] jesus said it's my choice
[1:48:39] i go to this cross willingly
[1:48:44] i lay it down myself i have the power to
[1:48:47] lay it down and i have the power to take
[1:48:50] it again
[1:48:52] this
[1:48:53] commandment have i received of my father
[1:48:57] and friends and i'm worried about work
[1:49:01] you know
[1:49:02] and i'm worried about
[1:49:03] um
[1:49:04] this architect that's trying to build my
[1:49:07] get my house drawn
[1:49:09] driving me crazy
[1:49:10] and i'm worried about those things and
[1:49:12] i'm worried about the cost of
[1:49:13] construction
[1:49:14] and i'm worried about how everything's
[1:49:16] going to go this week and i forget
[1:49:19] about the resurrection of jesus christ
[1:49:21] this man that said i lay down my life
[1:49:25] and i take it up again and not only ours
[1:49:29] but brother peter not only his but
[1:49:31] brother peter hours too
[1:49:33] sister dougals too and those and my mom
[1:49:36] and my dad and those that have gone on
[1:49:38] jesus
[1:49:39] has the power to to pluck them out i i
[1:49:42] mentioned
[1:49:43] i uh
[1:49:44] if you weren't here last time i preached
[1:49:46] i preached about rats swimming around in
[1:49:48] a bucket
[1:49:50] and uh
[1:49:52] what happened was these rats were saved
[1:49:53] there was an experiment done these rats
[1:49:55] were saved
[1:49:56] and then once they were saved then they
[1:49:58] realized that they had hope to be saved
[1:50:01] and
[1:50:03] that's what this gives me
[1:50:06] this man
[1:50:08] jesus
[1:50:10] being raised from the dead
[1:50:13] is the greatest it's the greatest
[1:50:16] revelation that we could have
[1:50:18] you know we we look at the seven seals
[1:50:21] tremendous revelation the seven thunders
[1:50:24] the church ages the third poll the the
[1:50:26] the tent meeting there would be none of
[1:50:29] those
[1:50:30] if it was not for this resurrection
[1:50:33] it would not mean as much
[1:50:35] those are wonderful aspects of our lord
[1:50:38] jesus and and my wife was asking me the
[1:50:40] other day she said
[1:50:41] we were talking about the seals and and
[1:50:44] some of these deeper teachings and and
[1:50:46] stephanie
[1:50:47] was
[1:50:48] she loved them and we were kind of
[1:50:49] rejoicing over them and and then we
[1:50:52] started to kind of place them
[1:50:55] and and she said i i don't
[1:50:58] necessarily understand
[1:51:00] the importance
[1:51:01] of them and i felt the same
[1:51:04] and many times i don't understand the
[1:51:06] importance of these tremendous
[1:51:08] revelations that we've been given but i
[1:51:10] believe the lord gave me the right
[1:51:11] answer
[1:51:12] because i was also wondering
[1:51:15] and these are little pieces
[1:51:18] of our lord jesus that he reveals to us
[1:51:22] it's it's a husband and a wife
[1:51:25] and and we we tell each other these
[1:51:27] little secrets that we have
[1:51:29] of each other you know oh when i was a
[1:51:32] kid i did this or or this is this is
[1:51:34] this part about me and and i love to
[1:51:36] hear that about my wife
[1:51:38] and i love to hear little things that
[1:51:40] she did as a little girl or when she was
[1:51:42] growing up
[1:51:43] and those are aspects in the carnal
[1:51:45] nature but these aspects in the
[1:51:48] spiritual nature these seven seals
[1:51:52] these seven last thunders
[1:51:54] these great things that the bridegroom
[1:51:58] is giving to the bride
[1:52:01] just tell me this is about me
[1:52:03] this is this is a little thing that you
[1:52:05] may not know i'm going to send my
[1:52:06] messenger down here to
[1:52:08] to
[1:52:10] tell you about these things
[1:52:12] so that you might know a little bit more
[1:52:14] about me but it is all
[1:52:17] about the lord jesus every bit of it is
[1:52:21] about the lord jesus
[1:52:23] first corinthians chapter 2.
[1:52:29] paul says this
[1:52:33] paul says and i brethren when i came to
[1:52:36] you came not with the excellency of
[1:52:37] speech or of wisdom declaring unto you
[1:52:39] the testimony of god for i determined
[1:52:42] not to know anything among you save
[1:52:45] jesus christ and him crucified paul is
[1:52:49] saying listen i know all these things he
[1:52:51] said
[1:52:52] he said that he has all of this
[1:52:54] knowledge so much so i believe it was
[1:52:56] paul that said that that
[1:52:59] i would be lifted up if it was enough
[1:53:00] for this thorn thorn in my flesh i would
[1:53:03] be lifted up beyond measure with
[1:53:04] revelation
[1:53:06] but even paul here says
[1:53:09] he says that i came to you and not in
[1:53:11] excellency of speech
[1:53:14] but
[1:53:15] i
[1:53:16] for i determined not to know anything
[1:53:18] among you save jesus christ and him
[1:53:21] crucified paul's saying all of these
[1:53:23] things i don't know anything but jesus i
[1:53:25] don't know anything but this this this
[1:53:28] cross and this resurrection
[1:53:31] and i was with you in weakness and in
[1:53:32] fear and in much trembling and my speech
[1:53:35] and my preaching was not with enticing
[1:53:37] words of man's wisdom but in the
[1:53:39] demonstration of the spirit and of power
[1:53:42] that your faith should not stand in the
[1:53:45] wisdom of men but in the power of god
[1:53:51] paul is saying that these things that we
[1:53:54] know that these revelations that that we
[1:53:57] need to be careful
[1:53:58] that a man can come up here with all the
[1:54:00] eloquence
[1:54:02] of of an archangel
[1:54:04] and and a man could come up here with
[1:54:06] all of the revelation
[1:54:09] and be able to preach it
[1:54:11] and to keep our attention and be
[1:54:12] entertained entertaining
[1:54:15] and to have all these things paul's
[1:54:16] saying be careful
[1:54:18] be careful because if it gets off of
[1:54:20] christ
[1:54:22] you don't want to go there
[1:54:26] friends the resurrection of jesus christ
[1:54:28] really does as it were separate the men
[1:54:31] from the boys
[1:54:32] it is everything to us
[1:54:36] we um
[1:54:39] as i said that that we're here
[1:54:42] on this special day
[1:54:45] and
[1:54:46] if i could do anything
[1:54:48] i would want this resurrection
[1:54:52] to stand strong
[1:54:54] in your hearts
[1:54:55] not on easter morning
[1:54:58] but on every single day don't forget
[1:55:01] christ took up his life again he was
[1:55:04] dead
[1:55:05] he died
[1:55:07] he died and he was put in the grave
[1:55:12] and after three days he rose again and
[1:55:14] these brothers were talking about some
[1:55:16] of the events that happened
[1:55:19] and i can imagine these disciples
[1:55:21] i can imagine say it was
[1:55:23] it was friday
[1:55:25] and they were thinking of this week that
[1:55:26] it just happened
[1:55:28] jesus rode in on sunday on palm sunday
[1:55:31] the week before jesus rode
[1:55:34] rode into this city as a triumphant king
[1:55:38] and people were waving the palm branches
[1:55:40] and they were throwing their clothes in
[1:55:42] the way and they were saying blessed be
[1:55:45] this man hosanna to the son of david
[1:55:48] and the disciples were like yes
[1:55:50] you know yes
[1:55:51] this is the messiah we've been with him
[1:55:54] the whole time he has he's done this and
[1:55:56] he's he's healed the sick
[1:55:58] and he's forgiven the sinner
[1:56:02] things are going good
[1:56:04] and he comes in he rides in and
[1:56:06] we know other people took notice of him
[1:56:08] writing in
[1:56:11] and then
[1:56:12] on tuesday or on monday the next day
[1:56:16] jesus is walking along and he's hungry
[1:56:18] and he sees this fig tree
[1:56:21] he curses it says and it doesn't have
[1:56:23] any figs on it it wasn't even the time
[1:56:25] for figs brother peter but he said
[1:56:28] you're cursed
[1:56:30] and he goes on and then he goes into the
[1:56:32] temple and and he sees all the sin
[1:56:34] that's in the church
[1:56:36] and he goes in and he sees them selling
[1:56:38] the the sacrifices and the and the money
[1:56:41] changes he takes the the
[1:56:42] tables he turns them over and he grabs
[1:56:45] the the whips and he says get out of
[1:56:47] here and they all go running and the
[1:56:48] disciples like man this is getting
[1:56:50] intense
[1:56:51] this is really he's he's it he is the
[1:56:54] king he's going to set on the throne
[1:56:57] and they're going
[1:56:58] they continue on and this week is just
[1:57:01] building in intensity
[1:57:03] and then on tuesday
[1:57:04] they're walking along
[1:57:07] and the disciples look up he's like whoa
[1:57:08] look at that fig tree remember what he
[1:57:10] said yesterday
[1:57:11] it's dead today
[1:57:13] the things withered and dying
[1:57:15] this man this power that's in the man he
[1:57:18] just keeps proving it to us over and
[1:57:20] over again
[1:57:22] and then in in saint john
[1:57:24] chapter 12
[1:57:26] verse 27
[1:57:27] my brother if you could put that up
[1:57:30] jesus starts talking to them and he says
[1:57:32] this he says now my is my heart my soul
[1:57:34] troubled and what shall i say father
[1:57:36] save me from this hour
[1:57:38] but for this hour i
[1:57:40] but for this cause i came under this
[1:57:42] hour jesus is again foretelling his
[1:57:45] death
[1:57:46] he's saying pretty soon i'm going to be
[1:57:47] on this cross
[1:57:50] and and i i won't i won't go through
[1:57:52] because of lack of time
[1:57:54] but then on wednesday
[1:57:57] and brother lyle
[1:57:58] very special lady
[1:58:01] on wednesday jesus is invited
[1:58:05] to this
[1:58:06] house of this man named simon
[1:58:10] and and he comes in
[1:58:12] his dirty feet
[1:58:16] and this lady
[1:58:18] knows that he's going to be there and
[1:58:20] she goes and she spends all of her money
[1:58:23] on this alabaster box of oil
[1:58:27] now
[1:58:28] she was a sinner the bible says
[1:58:30] many many takes is that she was a
[1:58:33] prostitute
[1:58:35] and
[1:58:36] she takes this oil and she sees the lord
[1:58:38] jesus there and there's just something
[1:58:40] about him
[1:58:41] this man gave her hope
[1:58:43] to be saved to be forgiven of her sins
[1:58:45] she takes the oil she pours it on his
[1:58:47] head anoints his head and then she must
[1:58:49] have just been overwhelmed and she just
[1:58:51] falls down at his feet
[1:58:53] and she just starts thanking him and
[1:58:54] crying
[1:58:56] and she's there and everybody's looking
[1:58:58] at the lord jesus like
[1:59:00] all right we know who this girl is
[1:59:02] and she's just crying and she probably
[1:59:03] gets embarrassed and she takes her she
[1:59:05] takes her her hair and
[1:59:08] jesus's feet has her tears on him she
[1:59:10] wipes it off
[1:59:12] and then jesus says this i do want to
[1:59:14] read this scripture
[1:59:22] oh
[1:59:25] matthew 26 my brother if you could put
[1:59:27] that up
[1:59:30] and they questioned him on it it didn't
[1:59:32] sit well with judas
[1:59:34] and they questioned him on it and and
[1:59:36] they said this
[1:59:39] they were uh they were upset
[1:59:41] this money could have been used to to
[1:59:43] feed the poor
[1:59:46] jesus says this
[1:59:48] for ye
[1:59:50] have the poor always with you
[1:59:52] but me you have not always
[1:59:55] for in that she hath poured this
[1:59:57] ointment on my body
[1:59:58] she did it for my burial again
[2:00:02] prophesying of his death
[2:00:06] this is really really cool
[2:00:09] by the way
[2:00:11] verily i say unto you
[2:00:13] wheresoever this gospel shall be
[2:00:15] preached in the whole world there shall
[2:00:18] also this that this woman hath done be
[2:00:22] told
[2:00:23] for a memorial to her this day
[2:00:27] that prophecy is fulfilled as i tell
[2:00:29] that story and it's been told millions
[2:00:31] of times throughout history
[2:00:34] with elias she was a very special lady
[2:00:37] this mary of bethany i'm not 100
[2:00:39] positive it was the same as mary
[2:00:41] magdalene or not but we know that she
[2:00:43] was a tremendous lady
[2:00:46] and i'm running out of time so i'm going
[2:00:48] to
[2:00:49] go all
[2:00:50] the way
[2:00:52] to my to the end here and
[2:00:55] where were we at i think we're out
[2:00:56] wednesday
[2:00:59] and then
[2:01:00] on thursday
[2:01:03] the lord jesus
[2:01:05] gets his disciples together and they
[2:01:07] come together
[2:01:08] and
[2:01:09] he brings them in and he washes their
[2:01:11] feet
[2:01:13] and he has this last supper
[2:01:16] and as brother lyle said he broke the
[2:01:18] bread
[2:01:19] and he gave it to the disciples and they
[2:01:22] still they didn't know what was going on
[2:01:25] and
[2:01:26] as they were eating
[2:01:28] jesus starts
[2:01:30] saying
[2:01:30] some very
[2:01:32] odd things to them he said odd things
[2:01:34] through his whole ministry
[2:01:36] he says this in chapter 14 verse 6.
[2:01:43] john chapter 14 verse 6.
[2:01:46] jesus said unto them
[2:01:48] i am the way
[2:01:49] the truth and the life no man cometh to
[2:01:52] the father but by me
[2:01:54] not moses
[2:01:55] not elijah not brother branham not your
[2:01:58] pastor not your mom not your dad
[2:02:00] but the lord jesus
[2:02:03] go down to verse 16
[2:02:06] and he says this he says i pray the
[2:02:07] father and he shall give you another
[2:02:08] comforter that he may abide with you
[2:02:10] forever
[2:02:11] they didn't know what he was talking
[2:02:13] about he was talking about the holy
[2:02:14] spirit
[2:02:15] and then in verse 27 he says peace
[2:02:18] i leave with you my peace i give unto
[2:02:20] you not as the world giveth
[2:02:23] give i unto you
[2:02:24] let not your heart be troubled
[2:02:26] neither let it be afraid
[2:02:29] and
[2:02:30] then in chapter 15 he he
[2:02:35] commands them
[2:02:36] to love one another
[2:02:39] these things i've spoken unto you in
[2:02:41] verse 11 i'm sorry john 15 11
[2:02:44] these things have i spoken unto you that
[2:02:46] my joy might remain in you and that your
[2:02:48] joy might be full this is my commandment
[2:02:51] that you love one another as i have
[2:02:52] loved you
[2:02:54] greater love hath no man than this that
[2:02:57] a man lay down his life for his friends
[2:03:01] but he commands this is my commandment
[2:03:03] that you love
[2:03:04] one another as brother aaron also
[2:03:06] touched on
[2:03:07] earlier
[2:03:09] and then friends
[2:03:11] right after
[2:03:12] that he went to the cross
[2:03:15] he's crucified
[2:03:17] and then
[2:03:18] on saturday
[2:03:21] he he was put in the grave on friday
[2:03:23] evening and then on saturday
[2:03:25] all was lost
[2:03:28] it was a terrible day it was probably
[2:03:30] the longest day in history i'll bet you
[2:03:32] it was even longer than when joshua was
[2:03:34] fighting um
[2:03:36] and he made the sun stand still it was a
[2:03:39] long
[2:03:40] day because everything that they had
[2:03:43] believed in
[2:03:45] was not true they thought
[2:03:48] how could this man be the messiah
[2:03:51] and die
[2:03:52] he was a great prophet we know that but
[2:03:55] all was lost
[2:03:58] and then
[2:03:59] saturday comes to an end
[2:04:01] they're afraid they're in one place
[2:04:03] they're afraid of the romans they're
[2:04:04] afraid of the jews they don't know what
[2:04:06] to do they messed up their whole lives
[2:04:09] and following this message
[2:04:12] this message of jesus christ
[2:04:15] it can't be true it can't be true
[2:04:17] because there's all of these so-called
[2:04:19] mistakes in it there's all of these
[2:04:21] so-called problems in it
[2:04:24] and jesus didn't fulfill all these
[2:04:27] but he did
[2:04:28] they just didn't understand it
[2:04:31] and then as as
[2:04:33] brother lyle said mary
[2:04:35] comes
[2:04:36] the most humble of all of them probably
[2:04:39] comes to the tomb
[2:04:41] and it gets worse on sunday morning it
[2:04:45] actually gets worse
[2:04:47] they're gone
[2:04:48] the body's gone
[2:04:50] now she can't even go and pay her
[2:04:51] respects
[2:04:52] now they don't even have a place to mark
[2:04:54] his grave this great prophet
[2:04:56] it was worse
[2:04:58] and then she goes and she tells the
[2:05:00] other the other folks and then peter and
[2:05:02] john as we know they come and then
[2:05:05] mary's over here and she's she's crying
[2:05:08] and she's just so upset peter and john
[2:05:09] come to the tomb they don't see anything
[2:05:11] they leave
[2:05:12] the angels say something to the other
[2:05:15] sisters that were there
[2:05:16] they left they they left excited mary
[2:05:18] didn't know any of this and she's so
[2:05:21] upset
[2:05:23] and then there's a man
[2:05:27] he says
[2:05:29] why are you crying
[2:05:31] what's wrong
[2:05:33] remember what i said about the
[2:05:34] resurrection it should always be in our
[2:05:36] hearts
[2:05:37] and how it's just so hard
[2:05:40] and these simple things like my job
[2:05:43] but god knows
[2:05:45] god knows these things these simple
[2:05:47] things like our children
[2:05:49] god knows you think he doesn't care he
[2:05:51] cares about the sparrow that falls from
[2:05:53] the sky he knows about our kids
[2:05:56] he knows about our lives he knows about
[2:05:58] our sickness he knows about those things
[2:06:00] but there has to be a resurrection there
[2:06:02] has to be that that in our lives every
[2:06:05] day
[2:06:06] it has to be here
[2:06:08] and then
[2:06:10] as brother lyle said
[2:06:12] he says mary
[2:06:14] oh god
[2:06:16] oh
[2:06:17] oh it's you
[2:06:19] what
[2:06:20] what is going on
[2:06:22] how could this be
[2:06:23] i thought i was wrong and i thought all
[2:06:25] of this i thought we were completely out
[2:06:26] of the lord's will
[2:06:28] we saw all these things going wrong in
[2:06:30] our lives
[2:06:32] it could be whatever it is we saw all
[2:06:34] these things going wrong and all of a
[2:06:35] sudden no everything was right
[2:06:39] you lost your faith you didn't believe
[2:06:42] but it's okay i'm here
[2:06:44] it's me
[2:06:46] and then we see
[2:06:47] that it's the lord jesus
[2:06:49] and he's here that's what the
[2:06:51] resurrection means and it should be
[2:06:53] always with us
[2:06:55] friends and if this resurrection story
[2:06:58] is true sisters if you could come
[2:07:01] to the to the
[2:07:02] your instruments
[2:07:04] if this resurrection story is true
[2:07:08] and we're christians we're here today
[2:07:10] so we believe it
[2:07:12] it should be part of our everyday lives
[2:07:16] that resurrected lord jesus
[2:07:19] should be part
[2:07:21] of everything
[2:07:23] that we do
[2:07:27] you know
[2:07:28] brother jordan i'm gonna i'm gonna take
[2:07:29] a little uh left turn
[2:07:31] i thought brother ed did such a nice job
[2:07:35] yesterday
[2:07:36] in the memorial brother ed would you
[2:07:37] come
[2:07:39] would you come up and and come to the
[2:07:40] pulpit
[2:07:41] and uh i want brother ed
[2:07:44] to close in a couple songs
[2:07:46] if you would come up with that come on
[2:07:48] up
[2:07:50] if we think
[2:07:51] about this resurrection story
[2:07:54] if we think about these things
[2:07:57] that happen to mary and as the brothers
[2:08:00] have said if they are real
[2:08:03] then friends we need to grab a hold of
[2:08:04] them
[2:08:07] there's there's like i said there's
[2:08:08] hundreds of millions of people come on
[2:08:10] out brother ed i'm gonna have you take
[2:08:13] the podium here and i'm gonna come down
[2:08:14] here
[2:08:17] there's hundreds of millions
[2:08:19] of people
[2:08:20] in our position today
[2:08:23] worshiping the lord jesus
[2:08:25] doing their best thinking about him but
[2:08:28] there has to be
[2:08:30] an elect
[2:08:32] there has to be a few people just a
[2:08:34] handful that will take that extra step
[2:08:38] and say you know what i believe him
[2:08:40] and i'm going to believe him today i'm
[2:08:41] going to believe him through my life i'm
[2:08:43] going to believe every single thing
[2:08:46] about him i am going to believe this
[2:08:48] resurrection story
[2:08:50] friends can we stand sister brother etta
[2:08:53] if you could start on a song
[2:08:57] friends
[2:08:59] this story of easter
[2:09:01] let this be a day that we came and we
[2:09:03] worshiped together
[2:09:05] and i i was so blessed by your brothers
[2:09:07] i was just it was beautiful
[2:09:10] thinking about the lord jesus and
[2:09:12] thinking about what he's done for all of
[2:09:14] us
[2:09:14] and thinking about the story of mary and
[2:09:16] then thinking about about what brother
[2:09:18] peter said that it was not just for his
[2:09:22] son
[2:09:23] it was for all of us
[2:09:25] and i think that that jesus if if it
[2:09:27] wasn't for this resurrection we would
[2:09:29] have had to take somebody's word for it
[2:09:31] no that that someday that that there's
[2:09:34] going to be a resurrection
[2:09:35] but jesus showed us
[2:09:37] that it's true he showed us that he can
[2:09:40] do it
[2:09:41] and i'll hold fast i know i believe that
[2:09:43] story is true
[2:09:45] do you all believe that story
