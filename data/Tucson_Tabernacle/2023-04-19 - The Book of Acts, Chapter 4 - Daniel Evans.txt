[7:37] to put that up
[7:39] it is good to be in the house of the
[7:41] Lord today
[7:42] [Music]
[7:43] gather together because he said where
[7:46] two or three are gathered he'd be in our
[7:47] midst so and he keeps his word so
[7:51] Psalms 92 verses 1 and 2.
[7:55] it's a good thing to give thanks unto
[7:57] the Lord and to sing praises unto thy
[8:00] name almost High
[8:02] to show forth thy loving kindness in the
[8:04] morning and thy faithfulness every night
[8:08] what a wonderful God we serve amen I do
[8:12] have a couple of requests here to bring
[8:14] to your attention
[8:15] from our sister Roberta baggage she says
[8:18] it's a prayer request for her Aunt Alice
[8:21] Strunk she will be having triple bypass
[8:24] surgery Friday
[8:25] at 11 30 a.m up in in the Phoenix
[8:29] Phoenix let's remember her and sister
[8:31] Melia Gonzalez said she's just not been
[8:34] feeling well it's
[8:35] there's a lot of allergies and dust and
[8:38] colds and things going through and in
[8:41] this body you will suffer
[8:43] we still have a Divine healer
[8:46] and also remember my daughter
[8:50] Abby and Chloe and Asher they've been
[8:53] for the last week and a half or so kind
[8:54] of colds and Esther had an earache and
[8:58] they were doing better today but
[9:00] I don't know when you see an adult
[9:01] suffering you figure well they can
[9:03] handle but when you see a child
[9:04] suffering it's kind of hard you know it
[9:06] just seems to touch you but you know you
[9:08] he can be touched by the feeling of our
[9:10] infirmity so brother Lyle if he would
[9:12] come as we stand
[9:14] and just
[9:15] take these needs to the Lord and open in
[9:18] prayer this this evening amen
[9:20] [Music]
[9:37] if it's all right I'd like to read a
[9:38] couple of verses from another Psalm as
[9:41] well
[9:42] Psalm 96 says o sing unto the Lord a new
[9:46] song
[9:47] sing unto the Lord all the Earth
[9:50] sing unto the Lord bless his name
[9:53] show forth his salvation from day to day
[9:57] declare his glory among the Heathen his
[10:00] wonders among all people
[10:03] for the Lord is great
[10:05] and greatly to be praised he is to be
[10:08] feared above all gods
[10:11] let's just go to the Lord this evening

[10:18] come before you knowing that you hear
[10:20] our prayers Lord Lord we come through
[10:23] the blood of Jesus Christ Lord we claim
[10:25] no righteousness of our own but we claim
[10:27] the righteousness that you imputed unto
[10:29] us Lord the gift of faith that you've
[10:31] given us in our hearts Lord and the gift
[10:33] of faith that you've given to those that
[10:35] have put forth these requests Lord
[10:37] because they know they believe that you
[10:39] hear and they know that you will answer
[10:41] each one of those prayers each one of
[10:43] those requests and for whatever burdens

[11:05] closer to yourself Lord that we could
[11:07] reflect and manifest Jesus Christ to a
[11:10] to a sinful and weak and dying
[11:13] generation Lord that we could just be
[11:16] those those lights Lord we just pray now
[11:19] for the remainder of the service that
[11:21] should anoint what sung what said that
[11:23] you'd receive blessing from our lips
[11:25] Lord and Lord that we'd all be able to
[11:27] say as we leave it's been good to have
[11:29] been in the house of the Lord that
[11:31] question in my heart was answered that

[33:41] the book of Acts
[33:43] I am I have to say that I don't know how
[33:47] many times I've read this book
[33:49] in my life
[33:51] but
[33:52] more and more I see the application of
[33:56] this book in our lives and I see that
[34:02] these same spirits that lived
[34:07] 2 000 years ago and we're so prevalent
[34:11] in this book are so prevalent now
[34:14] it's just as plain as day it's it's just
[34:18] it's an amazing thing to me I see
[34:21] as we went through and put in Acts
[34:24] chapter 1
[34:25] we saw that the author of this book this
[34:29] is his second essay
[34:32] the first essay was the Book of Luke
[34:35] and then this second essay this book of
[34:38] Acts was written to the same man this
[34:41] theopolis
[34:42] and written by the same author which is
[34:45] Luke
[34:46] Acts chapter one it defines the author
[34:48] it gives us a recap of the Resurrection
[34:51] story of our Lord Jesus and Jesus's
[34:54] instructions and it establishes Peter
[34:58] as the main spokesman at least for now
[35:02] as we see in the book of Acts Peter kind
[35:04] of Rises
[35:06] to to prominence there and he's he is
[35:09] the one that begins ministering then in
[35:12] Acts chapter 2 obviously probably the
[35:15] most famous at least one of the most
[35:18] famous chapters in the whole Bible we
[35:20] have the day of Pentecost and we see
[35:22] that as they have 120 in this upper room
[35:25] that we see that the sound
[35:28] of a rushing Mighty Wind comes into the
[35:32] room
[35:33] and then they look and they they look
[35:36] around and they see these pillars of
[35:38] Fire
[35:39] over each of the 120 that are in there
[35:43] and it's becomes as you look at it you
[35:46] can see the type
[35:48] of the Old Testament Temple
[35:51] and you can see this Old Testament
[35:53] Temple how it would be a powerful thing
[35:56] that would happen like like this sound
[35:59] of this rushing Mighty Wind and then the
[36:01] pillar of fire would would come down
[36:04] in the Tabernacle or in the temple and
[36:07] it looks to me like that Old Testament
[36:10] is a type of what happens here in the
[36:14] New Testament when no longer is this a
[36:17] temple made by hands
[36:19] but it becomes a living Temple where God
[36:24] can dwell and as he dwelled
[36:27] in the temple of old
[36:29] and we see in the book of Acts
[36:31] that this great thing happens this this
[36:34] day of Pentecost
[36:36] the Holy Spirit comes down and then
[36:38] people see and they want to be like that
[36:42] and they want to have that same holy
[36:45] spirit that these disciples had and they
[36:48] asked and Peter in such wisdom
[36:52] Peter instructs them on how that they
[36:56] can receive this Holy Spirit in Acts
[36:58] chapter 2 verse 38 he says repent
[37:01] number one repent of your sins
[37:05] shame start to change things and then be
[37:09] baptized Acts 2 38 in the name
[37:12] of the Lord Jesus
[37:14] for the remission of your sins in the
[37:16] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[37:18] of your sins and you shall receive this
[37:22] same gift that we have
[37:25] and then
[37:27] as we go on as brother Lyle spoke about
[37:31] last week a very very important thing
[37:36] happened
[37:37] in in Acts chapter 3. first
[37:41] but the wild brought us through some of
[37:44] the history he brought us through this
[37:45] gate there was this gate there that we
[37:47] don't know much about where there is no
[37:49] gate called beautiful today but it was
[37:52] this this beautiful gate where the Lyle
[37:54] showed us a diagram up there of about
[37:57] where it was and there was a man that
[38:00] was 40 years old
[38:02] that had been crippled since his birth
[38:06] and everybody that was so special about
[38:09] this is so many people knew this man
[38:14] and he would be helped
[38:16] to the temple and laid there and he
[38:19] would have his hands out or a cup out or
[38:21] something and that's how this man made
[38:24] his living
[38:25] and people would come in this is
[38:27] probably a busy gate and they would see
[38:28] this man and they would give him money
[38:31] but they knew him
[38:33] and
[38:35] after this day of Pentecost we see Peter
[38:39] and John these two Disciples of Jesus
[38:43] they came to this man
[38:46] and
[38:48] that moment brother Lyle changed
[38:51] everything
[38:53] Peter looked down on him the Bible says
[38:57] he fastened his eyes he said look upon
[38:59] us
[39:00] and he said Silver and Gold Have I None
[39:03] the guy probably had his cup there
[39:06] but what I have I give to you
[39:10] rise up and walk and the Man In The Name
[39:12] Of The Lord Jesus rose up and he walked
[39:16] now this was very very important what
[39:21] happened right here because it showed
[39:24] that this Same Spirit that was on this
[39:27] man Jesus who they crucified was now on
[39:32] these people
[39:34] and they started doing the same thing
[39:38] that Jesus did
[39:40] now they they came and and then at the
[39:45] end
[39:46] of acts as brother Lyle pointed out
[39:49] and it's very important that we know
[39:51] this this Bible
[39:54] when it was written it wasn't written
[39:57] with chapters paragraphs it may have
[39:59] been paragraphs I don't know how they
[40:01] they separated their their statements
[40:02] back then but it wasn't written with
[40:04] chapters those came a long time after
[40:08] this Bible was put together and
[40:10] translated and the the authors or the
[40:14] translators or the the organizers of the
[40:16] Bible they came in and they put verses
[40:19] and chapters in there so it would be
[40:22] easier for us to understand imagine if
[40:25] you had a book that thick
[40:27] and you had to find something
[40:30] it would be pretty tough
[40:32] and it may be organized by books but
[40:34] there's 66 books in all of these pages
[40:37] so if you're looking for something man
[40:39] it'd be hard to find to be like well
[40:40] that's about like two-thirds of the way
[40:42] through I think and you'd be thumbing
[40:43] through the whole time but now we can
[40:45] look and say baptism Acts chapter 2
[40:48] the book of Acts chapter 2 verse 38 and
[40:51] you can just look it up right here oh
[40:53] it's right here
[40:55] so that's that's how it was that's how
[40:57] it was originally written later on the
[41:00] we see these chapters put in
[41:03] so we see Peter preaching at the end of
[41:08] this Acts chapter 3.
[41:10] and
[41:13] Peter
[41:16] is is talking about is preaching about
[41:21] Jesus and he's explaining who this man
[41:24] is
[41:26] and
[41:28] he uh he he he
[41:30] doesn't finish his sermon at the end of
[41:34] Acts chapter three but he goes on to
[41:36] chapter four and let's start
[41:39] with verse 1 and brother Lyle
[41:43] um he read this when he was talking
[41:45] about Acts chapter 3 because it's the
[41:46] same sermon
[41:48] they they stopped it there because there
[41:51] was probably a pause or something it was
[41:52] a good place to stop it but this is the
[41:54] same sermon Acts chapter 4 verse 1.
[41:58] and as they spake unto the people
[42:00] the priests and the captain of the
[42:03] temple and the Sadducees Came Upon them
[42:06] now
[42:08] there are these two sects of Chris of
[42:12] Judaism that are pretty famous in the
[42:15] Bible there's many different groups back
[42:17] then but there's two very very prominent
[42:19] ones and that is the Pharisees and the
[42:23] Sadducees they're very different people
[42:25] very different they have different
[42:27] beliefs the Pharisees
[42:30] they were like the local pastors
[42:34] they had the different synagogues around
[42:37] around Judea and around Israel
[42:41] and they would preach to the people and
[42:45] they were actually a little bit more of
[42:47] a more liberal group
[42:50] than the Sadducees were the Pharisees
[42:52] were they believed in angels
[42:56] they believed in an afterlife
[43:00] they believed in a resurrection they
[43:03] believed in in many many different
[43:05] things and
[43:08] so but when Jesus was here they were the
[43:11] main persecutors of Jesus
[43:13] because Jesus was going around
[43:16] in Galilee in all these different areas
[43:18] and he was encroaching onto the
[43:20] Pharisees territory
[43:22] so they were the ones that really hated
[43:24] Jesus in the beginning
[43:26] but then we come to these Sadducees and
[43:30] these guys were the pompous
[43:33] self-righteous
[43:36] very conservative
[43:39] Temple Jews these Sadducees they they
[43:44] worked in the temple and they didn't
[43:47] believe in anything really
[43:49] they didn't believe in angels they
[43:52] didn't believe in an afterlife they
[43:54] didn't believe in a resurrection they
[43:56] were all about the order of things they
[44:01] were the legalistic group of the day
[44:04] they were in closely with Rome
[44:09] and they worked closely with these Roman
[44:13] uh guards and and with the leaders of
[44:15] Rome and you can see that in the Bible
[44:18] you can see the high priest he's a
[44:20] sadducee
[44:22] see anus and ananias these are Sadducees
[44:25] and you see how they were the ones
[44:27] communicating
[44:28] with the Romans is because they knew
[44:31] where their bread got buttered they knew
[44:34] that they had to stay in close with
[44:37] these Romans so they could keep their
[44:39] power and keep their jobs
[44:41] so we see that
[44:44] before we see the Pharisees were a
[44:47] little bit more
[44:48] um persecuting Jesus and then we see the
[44:51] Sadducees now because Jesus his Fame is
[44:54] going abroad and it's it's more
[44:55] affecting the temple worship now and
[44:59] these Pharisees and Sadducees they
[45:01] didn't agree on many things as I just
[45:03] said they were very very different
[45:05] Divergent beliefs but one thing they did
[45:08] agree on is they hated this man Jesus
[45:12] and they both both those groups they
[45:16] agreed 100 together kill him
[45:20] he is not doing us any good he's tearing
[45:22] down everything that that we believe
[45:25] so
[45:26] there's
[45:28] there's these two different people
[45:31] and now you'll see as I go on into the
[45:35] book of Acts you're gonna see now why
[45:37] the Sadducees are stepping up
[45:40] and you're going to see why now they
[45:43] hate these new Christians because these
[45:47] new Christians have a new doctrine that
[45:51] the Sadducees absolutely do not believe
[45:54] in
[45:55] verse 2.
[46:00] and being grieved these are the
[46:03] Sadducees let me read verse one again
[46:05] I kind of
[46:06] put a little bit of space there between
[46:08] one and two and they spake unto the
[46:10] people the priests and the captains of
[46:12] the temple and the Sadducees Came Upon
[46:15] them so this is a Sadducees speaking
[46:17] being grieved that they taught the
[46:20] people and preached through Jesus the
[46:23] resurrection from the dead
[46:26] remember these Temple priests they don't
[46:30] believe in the resurrection so if Jesus
[46:33] raised from the dead it has to be false
[46:36] because our way of thinking what we've
[46:38] learned we don't believe in that
[46:40] Resurrection stuff so we know right now
[46:43] that these so-called Christians are far
[46:45] they weren't called Christians at this
[46:47] time but these people that follow Jesus
[46:49] are are false
[46:51] and they laid hands on them
[46:53] and they put them in hold until the next
[46:56] day
[46:58] for it was now even tied
[47:00] how be it many of them which heard the
[47:03] word believed
[47:05] and the number of the men was about five
[47:09] thousand look at how the church is
[47:13] growing now Jesus had instructed that
[47:16] the pre that the gospel would be
[47:17] preached first in Jerusalem
[47:19] and we see all of this is happening
[47:21] right now in this city of Jerusalem
[47:23] things are starting to go things are
[47:25] starting to stir
[47:27] and we see these these these men going
[47:30] out to preach and here in this Acts
[47:33] chapter 4 we see the first real
[47:37] persecution of the Christian church
[47:41] the church had just formed and all of a
[47:44] sudden we see a persecution come upon
[47:48] the church now most Scholars
[47:51] believe that that persecution ended
[47:53] about 300 years later
[47:56] that this man named Constantine came and
[48:00] and he stopped the killing of the
[48:03] Christians but I don't think that that
[48:04] persecution ended at that time because
[48:07] we see the Catholic Church step on the
[48:09] scene and kill literally tens of
[48:11] millions of people Through the Ages and
[48:14] that was a persecution on the true
[48:16] Christians by so-called Christians
[48:19] we see
[48:20] this persecution began and and then more
[48:26] civilization has happened and now we
[48:30] don't see that we have to stand before
[48:32] execution
[48:34] for our beliefs for our Christianity
[48:37] because it's just not done here in in
[48:40] the western world
[48:42] but our souls are much more important
[48:45] than our fleshly bodies and that is what
[48:48] stands on trial now
[48:50] is our souls
[48:52] and our souls I mean how many times have
[48:56] we heard that it's better to lose your
[48:59] life
[49:00] to lose a limb or what or or gouge on an
[49:04] eye than it is to lose your soul
[49:07] verse number four
[49:10] how be it this is beautiful verse number
[49:13] four is just an absolutely beautiful
[49:15] scripture how be it many of them which
[49:17] heard the word believed and the number
[49:19] of the men was about 5 000.
[49:24] and it came to pass
[49:26] on the morrow that their rulers and
[49:28] elders and scribes and Annas the high
[49:31] priest remember in caiaphases campuses
[49:33] that it's an elected position kind of
[49:37] like the pope is now and anus and
[49:40] caiaphasis they were one of them their
[49:43] term expired or whatever it was and they
[49:44] elected anus afterwards Anis was
[49:47] cathis's father-in-law
[49:52] um and Anna the high priest and
[49:53] caiaphases and John and Alexander And as
[49:56] many as were of the Kindred of the high
[49:59] priest were gathered together at
[50:02] Jerusalem
[50:05] and when they had set them in the midst
[50:09] they asked
[50:10] and I assume this is Peter and John
[50:14] they asked by what power about why what
[50:17] name have you done this
[50:20] on trial and they're asking brother why
[50:23] is that where you stopped
[50:25] or do you stop for the next one okay
[50:29] they were sincere well let me ask you
[50:32] these
[50:34] Sadducees these priests were they
[50:36] sincere in their question
[50:39] here is this man that was was crippled
[50:42] his whole life everybody knew him they'd
[50:45] walk by him every day coming into the
[50:47] temple and now this man's walking around
[50:51] and he's saying look at me the Lord has
[50:53] healed me and he's standing here
[50:55] now they they go to Peter and John and
[50:59] they say how did you do this
[51:01] do you think they were sincere
[51:03] do you think they sincerely wanted to
[51:05] know how I don't think so
[51:08] they were trying to poke holes
[51:11] in these men because they're preaching a
[51:13] resurrection the way I was raised the
[51:16] church that I went to we didn't teach a
[51:17] resurrection it can't be right but they
[51:21] were teaching this Resurrection they
[51:22] were teaching a doctrine that didn't
[51:24] make sense to these people
[51:28] it was a divisive spirit
[51:32] and I I talked about this on Sunday
[51:35] morning and I talked about putting new
[51:39] wine
[51:40] this new Lively wine that still is
[51:45] fermenting and putting it in an old wine
[51:49] skin and the wine skin that can't Flex
[51:52] that can't move and you put this new
[51:55] alive wine that needs to degas that
[51:58] needs to ferment and it just busts
[52:01] because this wine skin can't move and
[52:04] that's how these Pharisees and Sadducees
[52:06] Sadducees particularly were they could
[52:09] not move with it
[52:12] there was no room for any new wine in
[52:15] these people
[52:17] then Peter
[52:18] verse number eight
[52:21] after they had asked this question then
[52:23] Peter filled with the Holy Ghost said
[52:24] unto them ye rulers of the people and
[52:26] Elders of Israel
[52:29] if we
[52:32] this if this day we be examined of the
[52:34] good deed done to the impotent Man by
[52:37] what means he has made whole
[52:39] now when brother Lyle stopped
[52:43] he left us hanging
[52:45] thank you for doing that brother Lyle
[52:46] that laid a foundation for me I know
[52:48] what you were trying to do
[52:50] they brother Lyle left off and said how
[52:53] did you do this and but why by what
[52:56] power and by what name did you do it
[52:59] and then brother Lyle said and we'll
[53:01] leave off
[53:04] very very
[53:06] plain answer here and Peter is going to
[53:09] give this answer
[53:11] let me read verse 8 again then Peter
[53:14] filled with the Holy Ghost said unto
[53:16] them ye rulers of the people and Elders
[53:19] of Israel if we this day be examined of
[53:22] the good deed done to the impotent Man
[53:25] by what means he has made whole be it
[53:28] known unto you all
[53:30] and to all the people of Israel that by
[53:33] the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[53:36] whom ye crucified whom God raised from
[53:40] the dead
[53:42] stick
[53:44] Mr sadducee I'd be sad too if I didn't
[53:48] believe in the resurrection
[53:51] these Sadducees
[53:54] whom you crucified whom God raised from
[53:57] the dead even by him does this man stand
[53:59] here before you whole that man that they
[54:02] healed at the gate called Beautiful they
[54:04] didn't heal him
[54:06] Jesus in the name of Jesus Christ he was
[54:08] healed and look at how these disciples
[54:13] these Apostles look at how they point to
[54:16] Christ
[54:18] we have these other people they were
[54:20] legalistic they had their ways and and
[54:23] they couldn't allow anything else sin
[54:26] this is the stone
[54:28] which was said it not of you Builders
[54:30] which has become the head of the corner
[54:34] Christ is that Cornerstone he's the
[54:36] foundation of the building of the
[54:38] Christian Church very very plain I'm
[54:41] gonna I want to switch very quickly to
[54:44] Matthew chapter 16 verse 15.
[54:48] now this is this is this goes back to a
[54:51] little while before and Jesus before he
[54:54] was crucified he is talking to his
[54:57] disciples
[54:58] and he asked them this question Matthew
[55:01] chapter 16 verse 15. Jesus says to them
[55:04] he says
[55:05] but who do you say that I am
[55:09] and Simon Peter answered and said Thou
[55:11] Art the Christ
[55:12] the son of the Living God
[55:14] and Jesus
[55:16] and Jesus answered and said unto him
[55:18] blessed are there Simon barjona
[55:21] for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it
[55:23] unto thee but my Father which is in
[55:25] heaven and I say unto thee Thou Art
[55:28] Peter and Upon This Rock
[55:31] I will build my church in the Gates of
[55:33] Hell shall not Prevail against it
[55:36] now we know
[55:38] brother Branham has told us
[55:41] that that rock that Jesus was speaking
[55:45] of was not Peter
[55:49] and neither was it Jesus that rock that
[55:54] this entire church right now we're in
[55:56] the book of Acts and this entire church
[55:58] is built on is built on the revelation
[56:01] of who Jesus Christ is
[56:05] that is how the whole church is built
[56:07] and and Jesus says right here that on
[56:12] this rock I will build my church in the
[56:15] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[56:16] it so that's how important it is that we
[56:19] are focusing on who this man Jesus
[56:22] Christ is even today two thousand years
[56:25] later if we try to build a church on
[56:27] anything other than the revelation of
[56:29] Jesus is the Christ the son of the
[56:32] Living God then our church will not
[56:33] prosper
[56:35] and that's how we see all these
[56:38] divisions
[56:39] that's how we see all these different
[56:41] groups we see all of this these
[56:44] different types of Christianity types of
[56:49] the so-called message all of this is
[56:51] because we lose focus of Christ
[56:56] and we start like the Pharisees and
[56:58] Sadducees we start concentrating on
[57:01] these doctrines that divide us
[57:04] and then our Lord just steps back
[57:07] because it's no longer about him
[57:10] it's about our own doctrines
[57:14] let's go back to the book of Acts verse
[57:16] 12.
[57:19] Peter says this
[57:21] let me go back to 11. this Stone which
[57:23] was said it not of you Builders which
[57:25] has become the head of the corner
[57:28] neither is there salvation in any other
[57:33] for there is none other name under
[57:35] Heaven given among men whereby we must
[57:38] be saved
[57:40] No Moses
[57:42] no Isaiah
[57:43] no prophet's name only Jesus
[57:48] everything friends everything pointed to
[57:53] this man Jesus I was I was teaching um
[57:57] you know what we started um
[57:59] we started that Ministry
[58:01] a few years ago in Jeffersonville my
[58:04] brother gave the testimony I've talked
[58:06] about it before this this gym that we
[58:08] started
[58:09] for boxers and for the Mixed Martial
[58:12] Arts Fighters back in in Jeffersonville
[58:14] and
[58:16] as we were getting going it was really
[58:18] starting to prosper one of of the um the
[58:22] people that was coming he asked the
[58:24] question
[58:25] he said he says I don't understand the
[58:29] difference between the New Testament and
[58:32] the Old Testament
[58:33] he says I've heard that we only have to
[58:36] believe the the New Testament because
[58:38] the old testament's a bunch of rules and
[58:40] and laws and stuff he says he says so
[58:43] what's the difference between the New
[58:44] Testament and the Old Testament
[58:47] and I said
[58:48] the Old Testament
[58:50] tells us
[58:54] what this man the Messiah
[58:58] is going to do
[59:00] it prophesies of this man the Messiah
[59:04] coming
[59:06] the whole thing
[59:08] is focused on one man
[59:10] and then the New Testament
[59:14] tells us what that man did
[59:18] and it tells us who he is
[59:20] and it shows us that he fulfilled what
[59:23] he was prophesied to do
[59:25] I said the the Old Testament is pointing
[59:28] to to Jesus the New Testament is
[59:31] pointing to Jesus the whole book is
[59:34] about one man
[59:35] and if any time you get away from that
[59:39] one man then you'll get off the whole
[59:41] meaning behind this book
[59:44] let me read that again neither is there
[59:46] salvation in any other for there's none
[59:49] other name given under Heaven given
[59:51] among men whereby we must be saved
[59:54] now when they saw the boldness of Peter
[59:56] and John
[59:58] and perceived that they were unlearned
[1:00:00] and ignorant men
[1:00:01] they marveled
[1:00:03] and they took knowledge of them that
[1:00:06] they had been with Jesus
[1:00:09] now as I was praying about that even
[1:00:12] today I was wondering I was like Lord
[1:00:16] if these unbelievers
[1:00:19] now we have to look through their eyes
[1:00:21] if these unbelievers they understood
[1:00:24] they took knowledge it seemed like
[1:00:27] these men had been with Jesus
[1:00:30] so what does that mean
[1:00:32] what does it mean if if
[1:00:35] these men
[1:00:37] for you and me it'd be like oh they have
[1:00:39] the Holy Spirit
[1:00:40] but these other men these Sadducees are
[1:00:43] looking at I'm like yeah you can tell
[1:00:44] that they were with this guy
[1:00:46] and I was thinking was it
[1:00:48] because
[1:00:50] that
[1:00:51] their way of thinking was different than
[1:00:55] than mainstream message Believers or um
[1:00:59] Jewish believers
[1:01:02] and now they believed like this Jesus
[1:01:05] and and things were different and and
[1:01:07] they said okay well Jesus taught this
[1:01:09] now they teach this so we to acknowledge
[1:01:12] that they've been with Jesus
[1:01:13] remember this book of Acts
[1:01:16] it wasn't name this originally but it
[1:01:19] says in our Bibles it says the Acts of
[1:01:21] the Apostles
[1:01:22] that's not correct
[1:01:25] this is the acts of the holy spirit in
[1:01:28] the apostles this is the acts acts of
[1:01:32] Jesus Christ in the apostles this is
[1:01:36] what Jesus does through the apostles
[1:01:40] this book of Acts has really nothing to
[1:01:43] do when you read it has nothing to do
[1:01:45] with Peter and James and John and later
[1:01:47] on in Paul and all of these all they're
[1:01:50] doing is preaching Jesus and then doing
[1:01:52] Miracles and they say wait wait it's not
[1:01:54] us
[1:01:55] it's him
[1:01:57] so that question
[1:02:01] there I wonder if they were thinking
[1:02:04] that Jesus had an influence on them and
[1:02:07] they could see that they were with Jesus
[1:02:10] or number two
[1:02:13] that they had been with Jesus and now
[1:02:16] they had his spirit
[1:02:19] and they were acting
[1:02:21] like he used to act
[1:02:25] the book of Acts
[1:02:27] the acts of Jesus Christ in the apostles
[1:02:33] and beholding the man
[1:02:35] which was healed standing with them they
[1:02:38] could say nothing against it so this man
[1:02:41] that that had been healed at the gate
[1:02:43] called Beautiful they these these these
[1:02:46] Sadducees where they were questioning
[1:02:48] them and and and wondering what and and
[1:02:51] they knew that this man was healed
[1:02:54] look at their spirit
[1:02:56] look at the Spirit of these Sadducees
[1:02:59] they did not care what the truth was
[1:03:03] it's a sad it makes me this
[1:03:07] I was reading this and I was like oh I
[1:03:10] can't stand these guys
[1:03:12] you know I started like and that's
[1:03:14] probably wasn't the right Spirit to have
[1:03:16] but just just thinking about how they
[1:03:19] they didn't care what the truth was all
[1:03:22] they cared about was their doctrines
[1:03:25] and if it didn't match their doctrines
[1:03:28] they were just gonna start poking holes
[1:03:30] in it
[1:03:31] made it just made me sick reading this
[1:03:36] um
[1:03:38] verse
[1:03:40] number 15.
[1:03:42] but when they had commanded them to go
[1:03:43] aside out of the council they conferred
[1:03:46] among themselves saying what shall we do
[1:03:49] with these due to these men
[1:03:51] for indeed a notable Miracle hath been
[1:03:54] done by them is Manifest to all them
[1:03:56] that dwell in Jerusalem and we cannot
[1:03:58] deny it
[1:04:04] but that it spread no further among the
[1:04:06] people
[1:04:07] let us straightly stress threaten them
[1:04:11] and they and speak and they speak
[1:04:13] henceforth to no man in this name so
[1:04:16] let's threaten them that don't preach
[1:04:17] this anymore
[1:04:20] what
[1:04:22] this miracle had been done don't do that
[1:04:25] anymore this guy was healed he was
[1:04:27] crippled don't do it anymore no no no no
[1:04:29] no you can't do that are you crazy
[1:04:34] they all saw it
[1:04:36] this was a miracle that's how important
[1:04:39] brother the law this miracle was
[1:04:41] it showed that God was with them and
[1:04:45] then it also showed that God was not
[1:04:46] with these these priests
[1:04:49] these ministers
[1:04:52] and it is everywhere today that spirit
[1:04:57] and they called them
[1:05:00] and commanded them not to speak at all
[1:05:03] nor teach in the name of Jesus
[1:05:05] Don't Preach anything that doesn't agree
[1:05:07] with our Doctrine
[1:05:09] but Peter and John answered and said
[1:05:11] unto them
[1:05:12] I love this that's just so we're talking
[1:05:15] about boldness
[1:05:16] whether it be right in the sight of God
[1:05:18] to hearken unto you more than God judge
[1:05:21] ye
[1:05:22] for we cannot but speak the things which
[1:05:25] we have seen and heard
[1:05:27] I love that boldness
[1:05:30] so when they had further threatened them
[1:05:32] they let them go finding nothing how
[1:05:34] they might punish them because of the
[1:05:36] people for all men glorified God for
[1:05:39] that which was done
[1:05:44] for the man was above 40 years old on
[1:05:47] whom this miracle of healing was showed
[1:05:49] and being let go
[1:05:51] they went to their own company and
[1:05:53] reported all that the chief priests and
[1:05:55] Elders had said unto them
[1:05:58] and when they heard that they lifted up
[1:06:00] their voice to God with one Accord and
[1:06:03] said Lord Thou Art God
[1:06:06] which has made Heaven and Earth
[1:06:08] and see and all that in them is who by
[1:06:13] the mouth of thy servant David has said
[1:06:15] why did the Heathen rage
[1:06:18] and the people imagine vain things
[1:06:21] so Peter you can sell you can see Peter
[1:06:23] here
[1:06:24] Peter's quoting a psalm he said he said
[1:06:28] this came from David
[1:06:29] he's quoting Psalm chapter psalm 2.
[1:06:33] verse 1.
[1:06:35] and Psalm 2 verse 1 says why did the
[1:06:38] Heathen rage and the people imagine a
[1:06:40] vain thing
[1:06:43] now Heathen in the Old Testament as I've
[1:06:46] said before he that doesn't necessarily
[1:06:47] mean what we think it means a heathen is
[1:06:50] anybody that's not Jewish in the Old
[1:06:53] Testament
[1:06:55] so it says why did the Heathen rage and
[1:06:58] the people imagine a vain thing so we
[1:07:00] have the Heathen and then guess who the
[1:07:02] people it represents
[1:07:06] anybody
[1:07:07] is listening to Jews right so we have
[1:07:11] the Heathen and then we have the Jews
[1:07:14] and they're both said right here
[1:07:18] so again Peter said who by the mouth of
[1:07:20] thy servant David has said why did the
[1:07:22] Heathen rage and the people imagine vain
[1:07:25] things quoting the psalm we see Peter
[1:07:28] was learned in the scripture
[1:07:30] you can tell that that he knew his Bible
[1:07:35] verse number 26.
[1:07:38] the kings of the earth stood up
[1:07:40] and the rulers were gathered together
[1:07:42] against the Lord and against his Christ
[1:07:44] here's the Fulfillment of that scripture
[1:07:46] and killing Christ as you'll see right
[1:07:48] here in the next verse
[1:07:51] for of a truth against thy holy Child
[1:07:53] Jesus
[1:07:55] whom thou Hast anointed both Herod and
[1:07:57] Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the
[1:08:00] people of Israel were gathered together
[1:08:03] against thy holy Child Jesus
[1:08:07] so Psalm 2 1 was fulfilled
[1:08:11] in the heathen
[1:08:13] remember the Heathen the Gentiles the
[1:08:16] Romans
[1:08:18] and the people in the Jews
[1:08:21] both of them working together
[1:08:24] to kill the Lord Jesus
[1:08:26] now notice
[1:08:28] one thing is very very important
[1:08:32] especially as I told the the young man
[1:08:35] the boxer when he asked what was the
[1:08:37] difference between the new and the Old
[1:08:38] Testament
[1:08:39] everything is about Jesus
[1:08:43] it's it's we can't we can't lose sight
[1:08:49] of Jesus and everything from Genesis to
[1:08:54] Revelation points to this man
[1:08:59] verse number 28 for to do whatsoever let
[1:09:02] me go I'm I keep breaking it up verse
[1:09:05] number 27 forever truth
[1:09:07] against thy holy Child Jesus whom now
[1:09:10] has anointed both Herod and Pontius
[1:09:12] Pilate with the Gentiles and the people
[1:09:14] of Israel were gathered together for to
[1:09:17] do whatsoever thy hand and thy Council
[1:09:19] determined before to be done
[1:09:21] and now Lord
[1:09:23] behold their threatenings and Grant unto
[1:09:26] thy servants
[1:09:27] that with all boldness they may speak
[1:09:31] Thy Word
[1:09:33] Peter's asking God here to give him
[1:09:35] courage
[1:09:36] in the face of their own torture and
[1:09:39] their own death which was coming
[1:09:41] as I said before we may not be risking
[1:09:45] that
[1:09:46] but sometimes I think that they had it
[1:09:49] easier than we have it
[1:09:52] I think that especially you young people
[1:09:55] and what you have to go through and what
[1:09:57] you have to see every day and and the
[1:10:00] world that you have to walk in even me a
[1:10:03] generation before you didn't see the
[1:10:06] things that that you see and didn't
[1:10:08] fight the things that you fight
[1:10:11] and
[1:10:12] it would be so much easier
[1:10:15] for us to just go to the guillotine like
[1:10:17] Paul did
[1:10:18] or go to the Cross like Peter did and
[1:10:21] suffer for a little while
[1:10:23] but now you can't just be killed for
[1:10:27] your beliefs
[1:10:29] you have to live in this world
[1:10:32] and you have to go through this world
[1:10:35] suffering and and people
[1:10:39] people trying to make you conform
[1:10:42] to this worldly way
[1:10:45] of living today
[1:10:48] before they might ask them to recant
[1:10:50] tell them to recant and face death today
[1:10:53] it's harder because you might get
[1:10:55] embarrassed
[1:10:57] you might
[1:10:59] you might risk
[1:11:01] being maybe not thought of as well in
[1:11:05] your circle of friends
[1:11:07] speaking he might speak a little
[1:11:09] different than the world speaks
[1:11:12] and
[1:11:14] when when you do this
[1:11:17] it's hard it's A Hard Road to walk but
[1:11:21] we have to be we have to be able to make
[1:11:23] that stand
[1:11:25] especially you young people you have to
[1:11:29] be willing to say Lord whatever it takes
[1:11:32] whatever you want I am willing to do it
[1:11:38] before we could walk
[1:11:40] we could just walk to the cross and
[1:11:42] suffer for a little while now we have to
[1:11:44] suffer our whole lives
[1:11:46] we have to we have to live in this world
[1:11:49] but by the grace of God as Isaiah said
[1:11:52] when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:11:54] that God will raise up a standard
[1:11:56] against it he raises up this standard
[1:11:58] and gives us more joy than we could ever
[1:12:02] imagine because we know that we have the
[1:12:04] Lord Jesus there
[1:12:08] now listen to this this is how important
[1:12:10] a Supernatural is
[1:12:13] by stretching forth give us boldness as
[1:12:15] Peter said
[1:12:17] to speak Thy Word by stretching forth
[1:12:20] thy hand to heal
[1:12:22] and that signs and wonders may be done
[1:12:25] by the name of thy holy Child Jesus
[1:12:32] and we see
[1:12:35] that these
[1:12:37] Sadducees how they attacked the people
[1:12:42] and they attacked him because they
[1:12:45] didn't they didn't believe like they
[1:12:47] believed they didn't act like they acted
[1:12:48] they didn't look like they they looked
[1:12:51] and I see like I said as I'm reading
[1:12:54] this I'm seeing our young people
[1:12:57] and my mind as I read this this morning
[1:13:00] again my mind went back to this Asbury
[1:13:02] Revival a few months ago
[1:13:05] and and what happened there and that
[1:13:09] this college and these these young
[1:13:11] people coming and they're praying all
[1:13:14] night long and they're singing and
[1:13:16] they're testifying to each other and
[1:13:19] laughs
[1:13:21] I'm just gonna just say it so
[1:13:24] it got out
[1:13:26] because of I guess videos here that I
[1:13:29] was supporting that that I thought that
[1:13:30] I thought that was that's beautiful
[1:13:34] and I got contacted saying
[1:13:39] well
[1:13:40] you know they can't be right
[1:13:44] and I was like well he says well he says
[1:13:47] well look at them
[1:13:49] you know basically they don't look like
[1:13:51] us
[1:13:53] I responded how many of the young people
[1:13:55] in your church are praying all night
[1:13:57] long
[1:13:58] how many of them
[1:14:00] how many of them are worshiping the Lord
[1:14:03] like that
[1:14:04] and yet you want to throw them out
[1:14:06] because they don't look like you think
[1:14:09] that they should look
[1:14:10] and we understand that there is very
[1:14:13] plainly in this new testament there is a
[1:14:15] modesty and there is an important part
[1:14:18] of Christianity that is looking like a
[1:14:21] Christian acting like a Christian and
[1:14:22] talking like a Christian but never kick
[1:14:25] someone else out because they're not
[1:14:28] seeing it like you see it
[1:14:30] even when the spirit is coming down upon
[1:14:33] them like Peter and John here and these
[1:14:35] different ones oh because you believe in
[1:14:37] the resurrection you're out
[1:14:42] Peter says by stretching forth I had
[1:14:44] prove Lord by stretching forth thy hand
[1:14:46] to heal and that signs and the Wonder
[1:14:48] and wonders may be done in the name of
[1:14:50] thy holy Child Jesus
[1:14:56] and when they had prayed
[1:15:00] place was shaken where they were
[1:15:02] assembled
[1:15:04] together and they were all filled with
[1:15:07] the Holy Ghost and they spake the word
[1:15:10] of God with boldness
[1:15:13] they asked the Lord for courage and he
[1:15:15] gave it to them
[1:15:17] so much so that the entire place that
[1:15:21] they were at shook with the power of God
[1:15:25] and the multitude of them that believed
[1:15:27] were of one heart and of one Soul how
[1:15:30] beautiful is that no wonder God was able
[1:15:33] to use use them
[1:15:35] neither said any of them that ought of
[1:15:38] the things which he possessed was his
[1:15:40] own but they had all things things in
[1:15:43] common
[1:15:44] hour of unity
[1:15:46] one heart one soul
[1:15:48] willing to give up give up anything for
[1:15:51] their fellow believers anything
[1:15:55] if there was a need
[1:15:58] they were willing to give it
[1:16:01] how many
[1:16:03] of us
[1:16:04] how many of the people in this United
[1:16:06] States
[1:16:09] could say that
[1:16:11] I am willing Lord if there is a need I
[1:16:14] am willing to sell my property I am
[1:16:17] willing to give up whatever it takes
[1:16:20] to see this gospel go forward
[1:16:24] it's a foreign thing
[1:16:27] but it has to be and we don't need it
[1:16:30] you know right now we don't
[1:16:33] but who knows what's going to happen in
[1:16:35] the future
[1:16:36] but these people they did it
[1:16:41] and great power
[1:16:44] and with great power gave the apostles
[1:16:46] witness of the resurrection of the Lord
[1:16:47] Jesus and great grace was upon them all
[1:16:51] notice again it was all about Jesus
[1:16:55] neither was there any among them that
[1:16:57] lacked for as many as were possessors of
[1:17:01] the lands or houses sold them and
[1:17:04] brought the prices of the things that
[1:17:06] were sold and laid them down at the
[1:17:08] apostles feet
[1:17:10] and distribution was made unto every man
[1:17:13] according to that to as he had need
[1:17:18] and I'll uh I'll finish here and Joseph
[1:17:22] who by the apostles was surname Barnabas
[1:17:25] which being interpreted the son of
[1:17:27] consolation a levite and of the city of
[1:17:29] Cyprus having land sold it and brought
[1:17:32] the money and laid it at the apostles
[1:17:34] feet
[1:17:36] I am
[1:17:37] and thus we have there the end of Acts
[1:17:43] chapter 4 and we can close if the
[1:17:47] musicians could come but but before that
[1:17:52] we see in this Acts chapter 4 we see the
[1:17:56] persecution of the Church begin
[1:17:59] we see
[1:18:00] this man that was healed was standing
[1:18:03] there we see that spirit in these
[1:18:06] Sadducees because it didn't look like
[1:18:09] what they thought it should look because
[1:18:10] it didn't act because it didn't fit
[1:18:13] their way of thinking they ignored what
[1:18:16] God was doing
[1:18:19] and they
[1:18:21] cast them out and threaten them don't do
[1:18:24] this anymore don't heal anybody anymore
[1:18:27] and then we see that there was such
[1:18:30] unity in these Apostles and this is what
[1:18:33] I want to leave everybody thinking about
[1:18:35] in this Acts chapter 4.
[1:18:38] that there was needs among the
[1:18:42] congregation
[1:18:43] and these people were willing to give
[1:18:47] everything
[1:18:50] Jesus said take up your cross and follow
[1:18:52] me if any man gave everything it was
[1:18:54] Jesus
[1:18:54] these people
[1:18:57] they were willing to sell their land
[1:19:00] they were willing to give their money
[1:19:03] because there was other Christians that
[1:19:06] needed it
[1:19:08] and it says that no man lacked there was
[1:19:12] no needs in the church anymore
[1:19:14] it seems strange to us it's like wow
[1:19:16] that seems that seems socialist
[1:19:19] but my point in saying is they were
[1:19:21] willing to do it
[1:19:24] I think about I think me and Lord I'm am
[1:19:27] I willing to do that if there was a need
[1:19:31] am I
[1:19:33] Christian
[1:19:35] as this word says am I someone
[1:19:38] in this Bible like this man Barnabas
[1:19:42] that that would give
[1:19:46] and
[1:19:48] I think that we all should examine
[1:19:50] ourselves
[1:19:51] would we be willing to give everything
[1:19:58] for the gospel
[1:20:00] ask yourself would I be willing
[1:20:04] everything give it all up like these
[1:20:07] people did
[1:20:08] because you know what that is what will
[1:20:10] bring
[1:20:12] I believe the resurrection and the
[1:20:15] coming of the Lord
[1:20:16] that is what will bring the holy spirit
[1:20:19] that we saw at the day of Pentecost was
[1:20:21] that attitude
[1:20:23] and when there is a need
[1:20:26] the Lord uses people to provide it
[1:20:31] and
[1:20:33] it makes me feel bad as I as I was
[1:20:36] reading this the past couple days
[1:20:38] I thought the God is so good
[1:20:41] he loves us so much
[1:20:44] that maybe he knows
[1:20:47] that it's hard
[1:20:49] for us to do it so he brings persecution
[1:20:53] upon us
[1:20:55] just like he brought persecution upon
[1:20:58] the people here we see in this chapter 4
[1:21:00] we see the persecution start and we see
[1:21:02] God raise up a standard against it with
[1:21:05] these selfless wonderful people
[1:21:08] and says I'll give it all
[1:21:10] I believe in this man Jesus Christ I
[1:21:13] will give whatever it takes today
[1:21:17] we don't need the money
[1:21:20] today but what we do need is we need our
[1:21:23] time
[1:21:25] we need our attitude to be that I will
[1:21:29] give anything
[1:21:31] for this gospel
[1:21:33] I'll do it
[1:21:34] I'll give Lord whatever it takes to see
[1:21:37] my children
[1:21:39] filled with the Holy Spirit whatever it
[1:21:42] takes for me
[1:21:44] to be filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:21:45] whatever it takes for for anyone else
[1:21:47] that I can I can just get in like it was
[1:21:50] 5 000 people because they saw that
[1:21:54] willingness that attitude to give
[1:21:56] everything
[1:21:58] doesn't matter it wasn't important to
[1:22:01] them
[1:22:02] that's the place that we have to get
[1:22:04] and I I fear is prophesied in this book
[1:22:08] that there will come
[1:22:10] harder times
[1:22:13] because God loves us
[1:22:15] why couldn't we just do it now
[1:22:18] just an attitude just just the attitude
[1:22:21] Lord I'll do whatever it takes
[1:22:25] that
[1:22:27] is what happened in this Acts chapter 4.
[1:22:31] now brother Aaron if you come
[1:22:34] what
[1:22:35] happens also we see
[1:22:39] in Acts chapter 5 I'll give you a little
[1:22:42] like preview
[1:22:44] in Acts chapter 5 we see somebody that
[1:22:48] was willing to give most
[1:22:51] but wasn't willing to give everything
[1:22:55] and we see what happened to this man and
[1:22:58] his wife
[1:22:59] [Music]
[1:23:01] not willing willing to give a lot or
[1:23:05] most but not everything
[1:23:07] and we see the difference
[1:23:09] between a real believer
[1:23:10] and this person
[1:23:12] that couldn't quite
[1:23:15] Give It All
[1:23:17] and friends we need to give it all God
[1:23:19] bless you
[1:23:21] book of Acts chapter 4 is
[1:23:25] merely I think it's my favorite book my
[1:23:27] favorite chapter in the whole Bible
[1:23:29] everyone I'm reading I say that that oh
[1:23:32] this is my favorite this is this is just
[1:23:33] the best but it shows a genuine
[1:23:38] it shows a uh a dedication that we just
[1:23:42] don't see in today's society but we have
[1:23:45] to have
[1:23:46] God bless you all I pray that this
[1:23:50] book of Acts that you stay in it that
[1:23:52] you keep reading it
[1:23:54] because I know
[1:23:56] it's
[1:23:57] it's a
[1:24:00] it's a it's a map work it's it's
[1:24:02] something that we can look at and we can
[1:24:05] apply it to our own lives and compare
[1:24:08] ourselves to these people to this this
[1:24:10] Barnabas he was willing
[1:24:13] man I don't care
[1:24:15] I want I believe this man Jesus I'm
[1:24:18] going to take up my cross here is all
[1:24:20] I'm going to sell all my land here it is
[1:24:22] let's get this gospel out and that's why

[1:24:38] has brother Daniel was speaking there
[1:24:42] if anybody gave everything it was Jesus
[1:24:46] he gave his all
[1:24:48] he said in order he told them he says
[1:24:50] there's a better way than this than me
[1:24:52] just being with you but rather my spirit
[1:24:55] coming and living there
[1:24:57] but in order for that Spirit to come
[1:24:59] there has to be a death
[1:25:01] it has to be a death in ourselves
[1:25:04] to receive that Spirit but because he
[1:25:07] lives
[1:25:08] and there's a promise for us to
[1:25:11] [Music]
[1:25:14] live
[1:25:19] I can face
[1:25:23] [Music]
[1:25:32] all fear is gone
[1:25:37] because
[1:25:39] I know
[1:25:43] he holds a future
[1:25:49] and life is worth the living just
[1:25:55] because it is the first verse
[1:26:01] God said to them
[1:26:07] they called him
[1:26:10] Jesus
[1:26:13] he came to God
[1:26:18] hell and for
[1:26:24] eign

[1:27:38] because when this life is over you just
[1:27:40] step from this one to the other one
[1:27:43] and it's real
[1:27:45] the angel asked brother Brandon we said
[1:27:47] would you like to see the other side
[1:27:50] he said oh it would do me so much good
[1:27:53] and when he comes by in his presence is
[1:27:56] here it's a touch of that other side and
