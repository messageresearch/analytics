Earth [Music] Proclaim Kings and Kingdom shall all pass away but there's something about all Kingdom will pass away but his is eternal and you're part of that you're part of that amen so brother ly and I think there was some sisters singing with you it's going to sing a little song special they'll have the words it's um a little bit of different language that we normally sing in but the words are easy they'll have them up [Music] there ladies on your good evening you're not really going to be having to deal with only me singing a song special because we all know that I can't sing but everybody knows that today is Palm Sunday right okay so Jesus entered Jerusalem many times if not hundreds but this time it was different from all the others we know that the crowds including the 12 disciples shouted hosana blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord hosan give now salvation that's what that means blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord they were saying what David has said in one of the Psalms Psalm 18:26 actually blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord hosana blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord I'd like us to welcome the Lord in songs so I'm actually going to teach you a song and you're going to help me and the way that you're going to get me to be quiet and sit down is when you've got it so pay close attention because you're invested in this as well so I'd like us to welcome the Lord in song as many of them did that momentous Day in Hebrew Okay so we're going to speak in tongues tonight but there's an interpretation so won't cause anybody a problem the tune is simple and are the words so we'll speak in tongues the the words I don't know if you have that entered in yet there it is the words are habash Adonai so if you just say that with me habash Adonai let's try that again Adonai you say brother l i can say baruk I don't how don't know how to say baluk well if you say the letter R you'll notice when you say an R you go say r that that your tongue curls up towards your pallet towards the roof of your mouth when you say an R you maybe haven't noticed it but that's what it does if you leave your tongue laying flat then R becomes a and that's B that's the that's a Hebrew version of the letter R they call it they do it by keeping their tongue laying down so it's habash Adonai so now you've you've got that here's what it means the first word b means blessed ha is the ba is come or coming and the object of that is implied in its male gender here so Haba means blessed is he that comes blessed is he that comes B in Shem is name and we say Adonai it's actually the yud Jehovah capital l r d and our King James version but in Hebrew we never say the name of the Lord we always say Adonai which means Lord or sir it's a it's a respectful thing that we say so so now you have it in tongues bashem Adonai and you know that it means blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord so we're going to sing and I'm going to have a lot of help from the ladies here because we all know that I can't sing but we're not going to stop until you participate so you've got it up there so go ahead [Music] ladies [Music] ad [Music] both there's another one that's coming in the name of the Lord tonight as our pastor comes let's sing it one more [Music] time sh [Music] there is no way I was going to come up to that microphone until that song was [Laughter] done good [Applause] job what a blessing I already forgot it I was gonna quote it and I forgot it no thank you sister Martha she gave me the words of the song Let's uh let's stand and let's open up the service in a word of prayer let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we're grateful Lord for your love to us we're grateful for the word of God that sits on this desk before me we thank you Father for all that you do for us we thank you for a loving church that we can come together tonight and talk about your word and enjoy the fellowship that we have with each other father we pray that you're with us tonight and that close our mouths Lord if it would be something that's not pleasing to you and when we open our mouths may it come forth as a word of God we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you all you can take your seats thank you to the Musicians we have a little different service tonight I'm I'm excited about it we started on our Bible study in uh over a year ago at the book of Acts and we went through the entire book of Acts and I felt in my heart let's go through the the every book of the Bible so we started in Genesis and we just finished through 2 Chronicles and brother ly suggested that hey why don't we take a break and see if there's any questions on anything that we've said to this point and uh I thought it was a very very good idea so I have a few questions that were just given to me but uh they're very very good questions so what we'll do is we're going to go through these questions and once we finish if we can finish in time then I would like to briefly go through each book of the Bible and get the the um audience more involved when we uh when we get to that so I think that'll be that'll be a fun time too it'll be enjoyable time so the first question is from The Book of Genesis it says here is it possible the serpent was just out in the garden and perhaps talked to Adam and Eve before understanding the Serpent's Seed was the serpent only allowed in the midst of the garden if they weren't allowed to eat of one certain tree were all the other trees actually fruit or something else very very good question very good question very deep question and I could spend a couple services on that but I'll answer B briefly let's turn to Genesis chapter 3 believe it's verse one I'll read the story Genesis 3:1 now the serpent was more subtile than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made he said unto the woman y hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the tree trees of the garden but the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of of the garden God hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest you die and then the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die so right there we see that the serpent was deceiving the woman number one we know that a snake can't talk so we know that this was not some sort of a reptile this was more like a man like looked like a human being talked like a human being Act Ed like a human being or else they could not have an intelligent conversation and we can we we don't know for sure about the first part of this question had they talked had this serpent talked to Adam and Eve before I would assume the answer was yes because they were together but but we don't know that for sure because it doesn't say this is really the first mention of this one of the questions that I asked one time was we see the serpent and obviously this serpent was a a male or was there a female serpent well there was there had to be because every Beast that was in the field he created male and female so if this serpent was not a human being which it wasn't a fully human being then there had to to be also a female serpent but as far as did they talk with Adam and Eve I I can't give a definitive answer understanding the serpent seed was the serpent allowed in the midst of the garden well I think that's a that's a little bit of a misconception here it's the serpent wasn't necessarily in the midst of the garden the tree was in the midst of the garden so the serpent probably like every other animal it was in this area so it's probably free to go as it as it pleased like Adam and Eve were and and then it says if they weren't allowed to eat of one certain tree were all of the other trees actually for fruit or something else we know that there's a fruit metaphorically speaking many times in the Bible it talks about the fruit of the womb we know that that be fruitful and multiply it doesn't mean plant orange trees and and grow fruit it means have children so we see that word fruit is metaphorically speaking there but then there were also fruit trees and there also trees all throughout the garden but there was also this tree that this woman ate of was the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil but there was another tree in the garden do you know what it was of life and what was that tree of life amen it was Jesus it was Jesus and only life can come from Christ right there so we see that it wasn't necessarily an actual fruit Adam and Eve could eat of every tree of the garden they could do pretty much whatever they wanted except they just couldn't do this one thing because that one thing would bring in sin and human nature wanted to bring in sin you tell your kids you can do whatever you want you can play in the playground but don't get up on that slide because it's broken you turn your back what they're what are they going to do right up on the slide it's human nature it's sad but that's what happened there in the Garden of Eden let's go let's uh let's read the end end of this so we continue on and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for God doth know that in the day that you eat thereof your days shall be open that your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as Gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave to her husband with her and he did eat in the eyes of both both them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons so they sewed these fig leaves together why would they do that and how would they know that they are naked from eating an apple or an orange or whatever it is it was an act that they did and then they understood human biology let's continue on and they heard the voice of the Lord Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself what's the first thing that I would ask if I was God he said who told you that you were naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou should not eat and the man said said the woman whom thou gavest me to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat and the Lord said unto the woman what is this that thou Hast done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did eat he tricked her he deceived her and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou Hast done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life now that we now we see the appearance of the modern Serpent and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed what is a seed right it's your babies it's your Offspring so that we know the serpent had a seed here and we know um that the woman has a seed which is Christ the seed of the woman and we see hatred between them enmity between them from this point all the way to the end now listen to this now they had just committed this act God is going one by one he goes to the serpent I love the way that he doesn't ask the serpent anything he just curses him he doesn't he doesn't care what he says and unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow in thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children you're pregnant and not just with one child children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee and unto Adam he said because thou Hast hearkened under the voice of thy wife and Hast eaten of the tree which I commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat of it curse it as the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life thorns and thistles shall shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat of the herb of the field in the sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread Thou shalt return under the ground for out of it was thou taken for dust Thou Art and unto dust Thou shalt return very very common in a funeral that scripture is read so um I think we have both to answer shortly I think we have both we have metaphorically speaking we have um the the The Offspring and multiplying and then Naturally Speaking we have the fruit that is in the garden and the the um the fruit that they can eat of and consume and uh was the serpent only allowed in the midst of the garden that's where the tree was is in the midst of the garden I don't know of anything that I could answer that was he only allowed right there so the next question also from The Book of Genesis what is the significance of MDC he has spoken little about yet highly spoken about so MDC is if you remember Abraham met this man mzc very very mysterious man also called the king of Salem and this man is mentioned in the Book of Psalms and he's also mentioned in the book of Hebrews and the book of Hebrews gives a very very good example if you want to hear a wonderful wonderful sermon about mzc go back I believe it was in 196 it'll be between 63 and 65 I think it was 65 that brother Brandon preached a sermon called who is thus mzc it was preached at I believe it was um it was preached at a junior high school in Jeffersonville my grandpa and this is off the subject but it's a it's a funny story my grandpa was a deacon in in the brandom Tabernacle at this time this is way back as I said in the mid-60s and they were everybody was waiting to get in and excited to get in and my grandpa the deacons opened the doors and the people just ran in and were throwing elbows and doing everything else and they got into their seats and my grandpa and the other deacons they got together and they went out into the seats and said everyone get out and they kicked them all out out of the auditorium and he said then they said now every one of you come in and act like Christians so then they all came back in but as far as mzc little is spoken about mzc but this is a very very deep subject brother brandham taught on having that we are a Triune being we've heard of the Trinity Father Son and Holy Ghost brother brandom said that there's not three Gods but there is some truth to being a Triune being and he said that God is a Triune being and he says we are a Triune being the father Son and the Holy Spirit the same God just in different manifestations and he said all of us are also Triune beings we have H I believe he said Body Soul and Spirit so there is a Daniel Evans that is somewhere in another dimension and then there is this one that you see right here the one that's in the other dimension Lily it's about your age but this one you see is not your age this is a corruptible body and then there is another body waiting for Daniel Evans on the other side that is the glorified body so Jesus when he came he came in a fleshly body just like mine just like yours this body got old this body got sick this body was hung on the cross and died it was what we call a corruptible body remember the I believe it was the psalm that said his body shall not see corruption even the body of Jesus Christ would have rotted that that was that body but then there was this other Jesus that was looked like him and it was him but it was in another dimmension and if you listen to that wonderful sermon who is this mestic you'll see that brother brandom said that that body that theophany body he calls it half the time he calls it a theop theophany body and the other half of the time he calls it a Celestial body same thing he uses them interchangeably that body was the one who went to Abraham and talked with him then brother brandom said one time he was he was telling a story now I don't know if brother Brandon meant this to be Doctrine but it really it really aligns aligns the same he said that when the Lord Jesus died on the cross and when he went down into this place to bring out the Souls that were that that had had been in a waiting place this place called maybe Paradise or it's it's a it's an area that wasn't heaven but it was a waiting place it was it was almost it was just a waiting Place Jesus went down there now this is Brother brandom's story and there was Abraham and his wife Sarah and Abraham Hears A his brother brandom's dramatizing it he says Abraham here's a knock on the door and he opens the door and he looks and he says honey look it's the one that met us under the oak tree which was MDC so it looked exactly the same as that man Jesus that went down and got them same person just a different um just a a different body a different dimension he's spoken little about yet highly highly spoken about um if you want to read about mezic I I believe it's Hebrews chapter 6 I think I would recommend that and then I would recommend Hebrews Hebrews chapter 7 yeah Hebrews chapter 6 and 7 if you want to read it in the Bible and then brother brandom uses those scriptures and who is this MDC wonderful wonderful sermon next question Jacob was angry with Simeon and Levi for avenging dena's death for avenging dena's assault that was their sister was there a better alternative or was Jacob only concerned with being outnumbered that is a wellth thought out question brother L do you want to tell do you want to tell the story of what happened and and then maybe give the explanation I'll I'll leave the I'll leave the question right here okay what is it that Simeon and Levi had done if you remember that Dino went down into the town of sheum to hang out visit the other young ladies that were there get used to this new neighborhood they'd moved into and and the the the son of the main guy there took a shine to her and carried her away and misbehaved raped her so the brothers got really incensed about this as they should have and Simeon and Levi then took something that God had given them as a sign of their separation that is circumcision and weaponized it turned this symbol of God this symbol of of of uh election and turned it into a weapon so they had all the men agree to be circumcised and while they were recovering from this these two guys went in and slaughtered them and they didn't just slaughter them but when we read in at the end of Genesis when Jacob is uh is giving his uh His blessings on his deathbed he talks about these two guys and what they had done and even to the point where they had um hamstrung the animals it was just it was brutal and it was cruel it was far beyond it was far beyond Revenge but they had weaponized this sign from God and and I I think that that is the the root cause of of the anger that was there Jacob also at this point uh Jacob is still Jacob he his name may have been changed to Israel but he was still there was a lot of Jacob still there there I you know I I desire to be a Christian but there's far too much Lyall Johnson that's still here okay so there was an awful lot of Jacob that was still in Israel and and that man and so he was very concerned for his own safy remember when when he came back from uh from Syria and he came back uh to see his brother Esau he ran away because he was afraid he was going to be killed he came back and Esau had this big crowd of guys coming and he was afraid again and and and so Jacob has a natural tendency to be afraid of people that might be angry with him and uh there's there's every reason to believe that the guys in this town are all dead but they have a lot of neighbors and there's reason to believe Jacob is well he says I'm very concerned we're going to be outnumbered and he says we're going to be the equivalent of extension their nostrils where they're they're really not going to like us we got to get out of here because we're in danger now because of because of what you've done um and so I I I think I think there is a better alternate not a better alternative for for the Revenge necessarily uh but that the the root uh Badness that happened here apart from the from that Slaughter was weaponizing this this symbol you want to add something to that okay the next question we have here is is is about the umum and the Thum do we know exactly what this is and how it works it's referenced many times but what specifically comes to mind is 1st Samuel 28:6 what is the IR that Saul consulted the Lord through it well the there was a breastplate that Aon war that was created that had 12 Stones on it and he was to wear it at certain times uh and and it was representing the 12 tribes of Israel the 12 Clans if you will and later when Joshua was going to be installed as the person to succeed I'm sorry I I keep thinking I have a microphone here but it's here when if I'm not speaking loud enough just go like that and I won't think that you're saying oh good job you're saying speak up okay okay so you don't have to worry about being confused that you're accusing me of doing a good job you're telling me to speak up okay so so elaser who was then the high priest at that time was the was to wear that ir and thunder when he installed Joshua as the high priest now we're we're told I believe that uh that sometimes they'd go and inquire they'd have a question and they'd ask the Lord what what what's the answer here and they'd look for this kind of a flashing light amongst the stones if you will the word urm is is again it's a Hebrew word and or or is light so orim is literally lights so there would be this flashing on the stones um the the particular story of 1 Samuel 286 that's when Saul is is kind of at his wits end and he goes to the prophets they won't answer him he goes here they won't answer he goes to the irum and and gets no response Lord should I do this or should I not he doesn't get any response so then he goes to the witch at Endor and and the story he devolves uh from that point so the irum at We Believe then would be the that breastplate that they apparently still had possession of at that time later uh when we get to the post exilic period and hear about Ezra and Nehemiah discover that there is no priest that has the um they they don't have it anymore so they can't inquire of it but it was one of the ways that they used to get an answer from the Lord remember this is before this is before uh they had the infilling of the holy spirit this was the era of God above us not God with us and not God in us there's another question here 2 Samuel why didn't David do anything against Ammon for assaulting Tamar there seems to be a theme for the mistreatment of women Amon Aman was the firstborn of David so he was the Crown Prince if you will uh just due to birth order and and we we read or touched on the we when we studied 2 Samuel about how Amon had deceived his half sister and then had assaulted her and then sent her away and she was the sister of uh of our friend well he wasn't our friend Absalom and uh so so absolum then wanted revenge and abelam then got revenge and and and killed Ammon and he had this party we we read about all that and the other King's sons all fled and and and so forth so why didn't David do anything about it I don't know that's the honest answer it was the Crown Prince maybe he thought that that if we just sort of ignore this it'll sort of go away this sort of thing unfortunately seemed to be not all that uncommon as we just read about the the the example of uh din assault uh and so there seems to be a theme to the mistreatment of women and and I would say that that is a theme that does appear to be there that that there is often times uh crimes that are unanswered that are not uh brought to Justice if you will it doesn't mean that what they did was right or that it was approved it was ignored it was brushed under the carpet so to speak um okay next question judges 19 there's a very tough account to read of what happened to the Levites concubine he reclaims her but seems just missive of her to let her be assaulted then again seems callous against her when he opens the door the next morning and tells her to get up why did he cut her up and send her body parts around the coast of Israel judges 19 I think I'm going to step back on that one um along with what brother Lyle said the um the women back then we didn't live in a they didn't live in a modern society that we we live in where women had rights women had the right to vote women had the right to own property and that type of thing they didn't have that back then women were basically property and it was just different than today that's that's the best way to say it is that it doesn't mean that there wasn't love between a man and a woman or there wasn't um there wasn't in some in es there wasn't monogamy between a man and a woman but things were just very different number one many of the men were were dead so there were a lot more women than there were men back then because of wars and and that that type of thing so it it was just things were thought of back then so the reason let me read this again very tough accounted to read of what happened to the Levites concubine and and number one also the Book of Judges is it's a tragedy of a book this shows how low morals can SN when you don't have God in your life you don't when and also when you don't have good leadership it shows that it says in the book of Justice many times that every man did which was right in his own eyes and those things there was no morality being taught it just wasn't it was a different time and it was a very very low time in history very tough account so why did he cut her up and send her body parts around the coast of Israel um he did it to stir everybody up he wanted to go to battle and I believe it was against Benjamin um The Tribe of Benjamin the city of Benjamin and it upset him which of course it would have have upset anyone so he um Cuts this woman up and sends her to the different tribes and tells them the story and then they get fired up and it worked what he wanted to do and they almost wiped out the entire race the entire Tribe of Benjamin because of all that that happened next question I uh brother L this one has a l next to it so I'll give this this one to you it says here Ahab asked Jehoshaphat to go to war with him and while ahab's prophets said Ahab would be successful Jehoshaphat asked him to find a prophet of the Lord who were Ahab ahab's prophets that Jehoshaphat didn't want to take their word very good question yeah that is a very good question so we know that the kingdom is split at this time into a northern kingdom called Israel that was established under jeroboam and was established under worshiping these these gods that he created and and put these Idols in Dan and in bethl and that he created the feasts and he created holidays he just created a whole new fake religion so that people wouldn't want to go down to Judah and worship in Jerusalem um so that's the context of Ahab and his uh and his reign in Israel secondly his wife was Jezebel she was uh from uh from siden so she was a gentile and and and also from a from a heathen place if you will and she had great influence Ahab was was weak morally in many other ways but he was a weak man so she could manipulate him and she did so who are these 400 prophets they were the ministers if you will within this Society of this religion that was a false religion to begin with and and brother brandham talks about this and and and says well the Lord's you well it it says in the Bible well well uh who who who will we send uh to convince uh these prophets to tell Ahab to go into battle so he'll be killed and fulfill the word that was prophesied over him by a real prophet and the lying Spirit comes up and says I can do it and uh God says yeah yeah you got it you got it you go down there you take care of this for me and I think brother brandom said that these were Seminary trained yeah yeah so so so you've got basically prophets of a false religion to begin with and so they're they're going their way and why is Jehoshaphat questioning this because he's an Israel he's allying himself with Ahab for some reason and the Lord kind of scolds him for that a bit later but but he's he he he knows that he's in a place where where they were supposed to have been worshiping the true God but they've gone off into this other place and so he says I'm glad that all your guys agree it's a little unusual to get 400 people in one place and all agree on something but you all your guys are somehow agreeing but but I've got this funny itch in the back of my neck or something I don't isn't there one more and he says well yeah there's this guy Mya this son of but I hate him because he never says good stuff about me and Jas is probably thinking well yeah yeah Elijah never did have anything good to say about you I want to hear what this guy has to say so so they bring M out and he prophesies the truth and Ahab says put this guy in jail feed him bread and water when I come back in Victory I'll take care of him and M says if you come back at all God never spoke to me and then we know the story that Ahab went out and and uh was destroyed have a question why did J B why did josph still go to battle and and and without having time to research this I'd say that it's because he was already in Alliance with Ahab so so jehos ofet goes out to battle with him and as I say later when they come back uh the Lord scolds joset for having done that and says joset you're a good guy but why he had exactly the same question why did you go out there with Ahab I even sent a prophets and said he's going to be killed you but but joset did that and when when the battle turned not the way that he wanted you know the first thing you read in in in the account of it is it he turned tail in his Chariot and went the other way as fast as he could go um he was dressed up as a king and Ahab was disguised as a soldier and and uh Ahab got an arrow and Jehoshaphat outran the arrows apparently okay okay uh another question here from First Kings same chapter please ex explain the exchange between the Lord and the host of Heaven in verse 19 who is the host and what was the spirit reference in verse 21 I think of God in heaven and Satan and all his followers down in hell are they all in the same place are they in each other's space brother Daniel I love that question in fact I had a conversation with uh someone this morning after service about this very same thing that's going on right here um remember what I said that there's a a spirit another Daniel that's somewhere else and then there's this Daniel and then there's a Daniel that's going to be that's going to be in this eternal body there's things going on in heaven brothers and sisters that we don't understand but one thing I do know from The Book of Revelation and I didn't we didn't have any time to prepare for these so I didn't have time to look up the the scriptures or the quotes on these but one thing that we do know is that Satan is not in hell today Satan is actually at the Throne of God right now and he is accusing each one of us before the Lord and and he is saying that you sinned you you said this wrong you blasphemed the Holy Ghost you can't be forgiven he's saying all of these things before the Lord right now and we are feeling many times that Spirit of condemnation God is not a spirit of condemnation Jesus Christ is the spirit of Salvation and Redemption and not a ACC Ching spirit so my point in saying that is there's something going on in heaven that we might not totally understand but I want to read a story to you that you might find very very interested interesting and it might answer this question that is asked here it says here please explain the exchange between the Lord of hosts in heaven in verse 19 who is the host and what was the spirit referenced in verse 21 I'm going to read it here in a minute I think of God in heaven and Satan and all his followers I think of God in heaven of God in heaven and Satan and all his followers down in hell are they all in the same place are they in each other's space so let's go to First Kings chapter 22 love these questions first Kings chapter 22 verse 19 uh we'll start with verse n uh First Kings 22 I'm in second Kings sorry I was very confused for a minute all right First Kings chapter 22 verse 18 let's start with Verse 18 and the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat did not I tell thee that thou that he would Pro prophesy no good concerning me but evil and he and he said hear thou therefore the word of the Lord this is the prophet MAA speaking I saw the Lord sitting on his throne and all the host of Heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left hand and the Lord said who shall persuade Ahab that he might go and fall at ramoth Gilead and one said on this Manner and another on that manner and there came forth a spirit and stood before the Lord and said I will persuade him and the Lord said unto him wherewith and he said I will go forth and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of All His prophets and he said Thou shalt persuade him and Prevail also go forth and do so very strange thing that was going on in up in heaven right there let me read to you brother brandom by the way references this story all the time many many times let me read to you a quote brother brandom says this well the one was saying this one or that one and after a while a evil spirit a lying Spirit came up from underneath and said if you'll just permit me I'm a lying Spirit I'll go down and get in all of them preachers because they haven't got the Holy Ghost that's the difference between Jezebel's prophets because they haven't got the Holy Ghost and I'll make them see they're just School trained boys and I'll go down and I'll get in every one of them and deceive them and make them prophesy a lie that's the way we'll deceive so he went down and he said and God said you have my permission to go and he went down and got into those false prophets School trained Ministry and made them prophesy a lie it was a lying Spirit working to the will of God let let me just something else you might see here a minute so the the main part of this is it was a lying Spirit working the will of God then brother brandom quotes the story about um turning someone over to the destruction of the flesh he goes to the New Testament I believe it's in First Corinthians and uh well we can just go keep going up if you would please um he keep going uh keep going I think I'm right uh maybe it's a different quote what's that oh okay okay well he he mentions First Corinthians and what had happened was this this man was sleeping with his stepmother and it it just causing problems so Paul instructs the Corinthians he said tell this man to to leave and turn him over to this to Satan for the destruction of his flesh so then what happens is Satan then now is loosed on this person and God uses the influence of Satan to make this person sick or cause problems and then that person will get so low that that person will then return to God you've heard of people taking other people out from under the blood that's not that's not that's that is it's actually a kind thing it's actually something you do in compassion because if you are right in doing it that person will stop sinning not just not doing what your church says but that person will stop sinning and return into the fold and if you look in second Corinthians that man had come back and had repented so we see that there God can use these evil spirits for his own to to accomplish his own will so now we see the question is there is this meeting that's going on in heaven it happened before happened in two other places that I know for sure if we go to the Book of Job And this is simply amazing Book of Job chapter 1 verse 6 now there was a day when the sons of of God came to the Pres came to present themselves before the Lord remember I was talking about our theophany body our Celestial body that other body that's in the presence of God right now that the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them so he was able to go to the same place as these sons of God and I believe that's the same thing that happened on this question that there was another meeting in heaven and I don't understand it it's another dimension it's something that I don't think any of us understand but something happened to where this demon came up just like Satan himself came up before God with the sons of God here in the Book of Job and then a couple chapters later I believe the same thing happens so there are things brothers and sisters there are things that are going on right now that are influencing us here there's demons that are influencing there's angels that are influencing and there is a battle that's going on all the time there's one time that Daniel he said this Angel comes to Daniel I believe it was Gabriel he comes to Daniel and Daniel had prayed I believe it was 21 days before was that is it 21 days I think it was 21 days before Daniel had prayed 21 days before and this Angel Gabriel comes up and he says Daniel he said I would have been here earlier but here's the thing the Prince of Persia hindered me I had to go and battle with him but then the the Angel Michael came and helped me and here I am and I'm going to take care of everything tell me how in the world all of this is happening I don't understand it but things are going on brothers and sisters there are things going on behind the scenes there's things going on up in heaven right now Satan as I said is up there he's accusing us he hates us he wants us to end up in hell where he is going to end up in the Book of Revelation you can see that there is going to be a time when Satan's up there right now there is going to be a time when he comes down and he becomes incarnate in a man and when he comes down the bride goes up to meet the Lord in the air and then that's when this tribulation starts it's a wonderful wonderful lesson a wonderful study it's in the Seven Seals it's in through the Book of Revelations a beautiful beautiful subject we'll get there any questions about what we've heard so so far okay now I'm going to get everybody involved wonderful questions whoever wrote these questions I can tell this person studies and really has a good understanding of the word so I'm going to grab microphone number two now the Book of Genesis who wrote the book of Genesis Moses the first 11 chapters of Genesis are about creation and and the line of Adam we just talked about what happened in the Garden of Eden and then after uh chapter 11 we go to chapter 12 and then this man Abraham comes on the scene and then basically the rest of the book is about Abraham and his family remember Abraham's son Isaac Abra and and then Isaac Jacob and then Jacob well Jacob had the 12 Patriarchs changed his name to Israel and that's why we call the country Israel very simple and then it goes through to Joseph Joseph is uh is just is blessed he he gets thr impr prison he he moves the family everybody to Egypt then there's this long period of time after Joseph dies hundreds of years that they're in Egypt and they're doing well and they're multiplying and then they're raises up a pharaoh that did not know Joseph and he gets threatened by all of these multiplying Hebrews very fruitful people as we go back to the metaphor in the book at the beginning of the book so what I'd like to do we'll start with Genesis and we'll go 15 minutes we have about 15 minutes to do this and then we'll go book by book we know that we see Adam and Eve all the way down through Joseph we we see methus and we see Enoch and we see all of these these different great people we see Sarah um the wife of Abraham we see Hagar coutura um we see Rachel and we see Rebecca I want to ask someone have you ever thought if you could just drop yourself in the Bible you know Google when you when you when you go there and you're on your computer screen and you grab the guy and you drop him into Google Maps and he like Wiggles his hand and he he lands and then he just you're on the street in street view you know that so let's have you ever done that and thought what would I do if I knew one of these people what would I ask them what would I say to these people in the Book of Genesis I need somebody to help me have you ever thought about somebody in Genesis and what would you like to ask that person brother Ronnie I'll just I'll say it go ahead L he got he got the he got the blessing what was that blessing was it an infilling the Holy Spirit did he meet an angel did he cry because we know when Cain he was wroth he had saw this and God did not accept his his um uh offering and he recognized a true worshipper I'm just what kind of blessing was it what a what a question so what happened was is both Cain and Abel made sacrifices do you remember what Abel's sacrifice was right do you remember what Cain's sacrifice was yeah it was plants and that so God accepted Abel's sacrifice do you know why because of the blood because this was it it was it was it was it it had to do with Christ later on and remember when um they were naked and God took skins and clothed them well he made the first sacrifice and then there is Abel knows this story and then Abel does the same thing that God did Cain he goes and he offers some beautiful thing plants or whatever and God accepted Abel's but did not accept Caines and then as brother Ronnie said he received these blessings what were the blessings that Abel received we don't know but it's seems like there is the father what greater blessing would you want to have than the Lord saying well done my good and faithful servant amen great question so we go through Genesis one more question about Genesis does someone want to talk say something about brother Josiah fine uh Genesis 17:17 God tells in the verse before in the verses before he says uh he renames Abram Abraham he renames Sarai Sarai Sarah and he says I will bless her and give thee a son and uh she'll be a mother of many nations and they'll be Kings and it says and Abraham fell upon his face and laughed when Sarah laughed she immediately got called out why didn't Abraham get called out anybody want to answer let me ask you I will answer your question with a question what was Abraham's son's name what does Isaac mean laughter my answer answer which may be right or may not be right is that that was the name of that young man and that's how Abraham fell down and laughed yes now we get to give it to the Theologian Abraham is laughing wow this is going to happen to me I can't believe it and Sarah is saying I don't think so there so it's it's it's translated the same but we lose that in the translation but I believe if you go back and look at at at the original language that you'll see that there's a difference in the nature of the laughter that's occurring it is important brothers and sisters it is important to understand these things and and these scholarly people like brother L they bring a lot to the table I think the answer of laughter it's the same it's correct that I that was Isaac's name but it was the good laughter not the bad laughter right so then we go through Genesis all the way to the end it ends with Joseph dying and going to Egypt and his family and then it goes along hundreds of years like 400 years and There Rose up a pharaoh that did not respect the Hebrews the Bible says didn't know Joseph so this man starts killing the children starts persecuting these these Hebrews because there was just too many of them starts Exterminating they're enslaved they had a hard life this man named a amram prayed and prayed and the lord gave him and his wife jobed a son um they they already had a at least one son and and at least one daughter and gave them a son and this man was going to be the deliverer to take them out you know the story of Moses they put Moses in the N River and he floats down and a relation to um was it his sister or his his his uh daughter no his um Pharaoh's sister Pharaoh's daughter so Pharaoh's daughter finds the basket in the in the water she takes it out and then she takes this Hebrew baby to be her own and this man Moses raises up to be does anybody know about how old he was when when he came to full maturity and he ended up leaving Egypt 40 years old he goes then he leaves he he ends up killing an Egyptian his own people betray him he goes out and uh spends another 40 years in the wilderness we don't know much about what happened at that time he gets married comes back God God talks to him in in a burning bush sends him back to Egypt to pull the people out he brings plagues everything from frogs and turning the water to blood all the way till the last the death angel came and killed the firstborn son that did not have the blood over the lentil and on the doorpost the death angel brings the people out they go great Miracles the Red Sea Parts brings them through there brings them to the other side they start complaining they start having problems in the book of Exodus goes all the way to um is it Cades Baria where does the book of Exodus go to all the way to the end right right to it gets them to Mount Mount Si now with all the people that we have we have Moses we have amram we have um we have jocked we have Miriam we have Joshua we have all these characters in the book of Exodus what would you want to ask one of these characters in the book of exus what would you like to have a conversation Naomi why did Aaron agree to build the golden calf you have an answer brother Lyall why did Aaron agree to build this golden calf at Mount at Mount S no I I I think that Aaron again people didn't have the Holy Spirit at that time he'd seen the Miracles Moses has been gone for a long time they see the Thunder they see the lightning they're afraid they don't want to approach the mountain they think Moses is dead and what is their background their background is from Egypt and what was one of the chief goddesses of Egypt the goddess of all sorts of stuff was was hator who was symbolized as a coward so so a calf would be yeah well we're descendants from that we've come out of golden calf so it it's it's part of the culture that they came from and so they thought well my opinion just my opinion that they they went back to what they were familiar with when which I think also indicates that worshiping Idols was something that they had done all their life understand that there was no penit there was no law there was no rules there was no there was no anything just this we circumcised our kids and God said he's going to do something good for us someday end a story that's their entire religion they don't they don't have a religion so their only religious practice is what they learned in Egypt and you'll find that when they make the Tabernacle when when Solomon builds a temple it's patterned very similar to the temples that uh that were in Egypt that Heather and I saw when we were there three years ago and also um they thought Moses was gone they didn't think he was coming back and the Bible also says as the dog returns to its vomit and the hog to its wallow so many times brothers and sisters we will come out of something and then we'll go right back into the same thing have you heard I know you've in in school and taken psychology classes you see that they they often use a an abused woman and if if a if a her husband mistreats her and physically abuses her many times or her dad does many times that woman will find a husband that does the same thing that acts the same way it's because that is what she has grown up that's what she understands and it's the same thing with the church you see so many people they'll come out of a cult like church and man they go right back into another one and that's exactly at least my understanding it looks like and and also what brother Lyle said it looks like that's just what that was their comfort zone so they went right back to that and also keep in mind that in Egypt Moses did a miracle Janice and jambers did Miracles too it's not like they were coming from something that was just psychology it's something that they had seen Now The Book of Leviticus so we talk about going to this Mount Si the Book of Leviticus takes place right at the foot of this mountain and they're there for one year am I right brother Lyall this whole book is written in just one short time span so Leviticus it's kind of like the sun and what it is is Moses God is telling the people he's like he's telling them that you don't want to get too close to God because you'll die but then if you get too far away from God you'll you'll die too so it's like this it's like the sun you can enjoy the warmth of the Sun but don't sit there and stare at it or you're going to go blind and that's how the Book of Leviticus is The Book of Leviticus is how to stay in the presence of God don't get too close but then don't get too far away so we we see in Leviticus we see mainly we see the different types of sacrifices and this is really this is the law you you hear in the New Testament you hear in the Old Testament that they talk about the law The Book of Leviticus is quoted over and over and over again being the law that Moses brought um it's short does does anyone have anything about the The Book of Leviticus I doubt you do but it's it's about the sacrifices and and how and and really every single sacrifice that you read in the Book of Leviticus it pertains to Christ there's there's a couple sacrifices that there's really there's five types of of sacrifices there's two that are in Thanksgiving gratitude for God's blessings and then there's three for repentance and that would be when they when they kill the animal brother Jordan go ahead and yell it out and I'll I'll repeat it on the microphone when brother Jordan says they they chose law over Grace I believe that brother brandom was referring to when Moses wanted the people to go up and to speak to God and they got afraid and they said let not God Speak but let Moses speak because Moses with Moses there was there was a lot more um patience there was a lot the stakes were much lower with Moses than they were with Jehovah God on the mountain so they chose to have this law rather than Grace and how would Moses have done different i' like to ask him brother Moses what would you have done I know that you covered your face one time when your face Shone maybe it was to so the people didn't concentrate on you that's a very very good question brother Jordan I don't I don't know all of us would do things differently but I don't know I don't know what he would have done so then Leviticus goes through and then we pick up with numbers and numbers picks up right off at the end of Exodus so numbers goes along and and this is when Moses sends the 12 Spies over the Jordan Rim River into the promised land there they followed a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of Fire by night and some of the characters there um oh oh yeah that's when that Moses built the bronze serpent so they're out there in the wilderness and there's these these snakes these vipers these poisonous snakes and they keep getting bit and and dying and having problems and Moses sets up this brass or bronze serpent up in the wilderness and when you get bit you just look at that and you're you get healed um so that's the Book of Numbers does anyone have anything to say about the book of numbers we're running out of time this is a this is enjoyable book of Deuteronomy means the second law and it's the last book of Moses it begins with Moses and he's instructing this new generation the old generation they complain they they they angered God so God said none of you are going to go over to this promised land except for two do you know who the two were Joshua and Caleb even Moses himself didn't get to go over you know why he didn't get to go over he smot The Rock when God told him to speak to the Rock so then the Deuteronomy Deuteronomy goes until the the end and it's basically Moses giving encouragement and correction to the people and it ends basically with Moses saying he says listen I know what's going to happen and you're going to fail and then Moses goes up on the mountain and the Bible says that Moses the servant of the Lord died so then we have the first five books of the Bible the last chapter Deuteronomy was most likely written by Moses's right-hand man Joshua then we move into Joshua Joshua now has the promise to go over all of the other ones are have died out and now Joshua brings the people and they go over the Jordan River and they start Conquering the new land this is when they it's really a neat story he get he's he's about to he's about to go over he's about to go to battle and Joshua was a fighter man he was a warrior and he's he's an old man now but Joshua's going along and he sees this man with this sword drawn and the old man Joshua he pulls his sword and he looks at this man and he says you're you for us are you for our enemies and you know what this man said he said neither he said I come from the I am the captain of the host of the Lord he was an angel that came from God but I love the way he said that basically Joshua was like are you for us are you for our enemies he's like no I'm on God's side as long as you're on God's side you're going to do well so then they go over they conquer Jericho the walls fall down they uh they talk to Rahab the Harlot then they go into the this next city Ai and we see aen and he messes everything up and then Joshua piles up the stones in the Jordan River and then he piles them takes them and piles them up a Gil gal and says bring your children back to these stones and tell this story does anyone have any to say about the Book of Joshua Brother Joseph go ahead and I'll repeat it there's a lot of good guys and there's a lot more bad guys and and we find that today we feel like we're good guys here I for the most part right and uh there's a whole lot of bad guys did God create the bad guys did he create them to be bad guys is is that a fate that could bestow me could I be a bad guy uh yeah um there's we are all free moral agents as the New Testament teaches us but there are those that God has predestinated to eternal life now though that doesn't mean that you don't have a choice you can't saywell God just predestinated me to destruction Judas was born the son of Destruction he was born that way but Judas had to make a choice and all of these bad guys they make the wrong choice they choose the wrong side because generally their heart is not right so they are given a choice but God knows through pred destination God knows what choice that they're going to make very very good question after Joshua we go to the Book of Judges and this is all the stories the Book of Judges can be summed summed up with every man did that which was right in his own eyes and there was no good leadership in the Book of Judges then they would they would well there was some good leadership but they would they would sin God would send them a deliverer anneal or Gideon or Samson or Deborah or or baric or or these these different Great Men God would send the deliverer and get them straightened out that deliverer would eventually die and then they would again go back into sin it is a vicious cycle that has happened throughout history and it's even happening today and you see how important important leadership is leadership in the church leadership in the families leadership in the country it's all very very important and the Book of Judges shows how important and how bad leadership and we answered a question I believe on um cutting up the a woman and and sending her out to different places it's just an immoral Society Ruth does anyone have any statements on the Book of Judges couple more minutes Book of Ruth um beautiful love story between Ruth and Boaz really types the Lord Jesus and his bride here's this woman Ruth she's a gentile she uh her husband dies and and she goes with her mother-in-law and she is Redeemed by a kinan redeemer named boas any comments on the Book of Ruth of Ruth I don't know wasn't Ruth you you'll find in our society there's a title of the book and then there's the author and in our culture it's important to know who wrote it or who claims to have written it in ancient times it wasn't about who wrote it it's about what is it say so we don't know who wrote the Book of Ruth we do know that after the period of captivity and so forth when when various writings were collected together to create what we call the Bible canonize them as we say that this was recognized by the people of the day as being this is the word of God and so but but it's not because Fred wrote it or Arthur wrote it or John wrote it it's because of what it says amen 1 and 2 Samuel they were originally one book they're about uh this lady named Hannah who was Barren and God gave her a child this priest named Eli who raised this child this child's name was Samuel he grew up to be a great prophet of God he anoints this man king named Saul because the people want a king they don't want to be ruled by God they want to be like everybody else so God gives them what they want and God usually gives us what what we want God gives them what they want he gave him this big tall good-looking guy named Saul Saul was good for a couple years he ruled over Israel for 40 years for like 38 39 yard years he was not good then this young man David raises up kills Goliath Saul hates him they go round and round and Saul keeps trying to kill him and uh it ends up with Saul dying in battle then we continue on in 2 Samuel we can David is anointed king he has problems with Absalom his son he um fights many many battles and and wins many battles there's a prophet Samuel is there Samuel dies the next Prophet is Nathan Nathan instructs Samuel or instructs David on things David has an affair with basba they have a son son dies David before before the son dies David sends out the the husband of basba in the battle he instructs joab I mean Uriah this man even brought the orders himself gives them to joab joab reads the orders sends them out into the heat of the battle and then tells the soldiers to pull back and leave this man Uriah who was a Mighty Man to die in battle shows the the weaknesses of David first and 2 Samuel 1 and 2 Kings 1 and 2 Chronicles they all tell many of the same stories then David has a son with this same woman Bas Sheba this son's named Samuel Samuel turns out to be a very very prosperous King he lives in probably the most prosperous time I'm sorry did I say Samuel I yeah Solomon Solomon lives in the most prosperous time and God instructs David wants to build a temple he wants to build a house for the Lord the Lord says no you can't build it build it David but your son can build it so then Solomon builds a temple um first and second Kings goes along we we see the Prophet Elijah we see Elisha we see these great prophets rise up so what what happens is is God sent the law but then he also sent prophets after the law to make sure the people are following the law and that is basically the book of 1 and 2 Samuel they were one book first and second Kings or one book and then 1 and 2 Chronicles 1 and 2 Chronicles cover the time from David on to the Captivity when Nebuchadnezzar came in then um first first and second Kings covers from um Solomon all the way to the Captivity there any questions brother Andrew you forgot let me get let me get Andrews first questions and answers on Genesis I've just wondered from the perspective of Saul I'm sorry Solomon we know what happened to Solomon but I'd like to ask him did he ever fulfill what he wanted to on his heart to serve the people of Israel with all everything God blessed him with did he ever fulfill that desire I'd like to know what he said about it so what brother Andrew is talking about is when Solomon was anointed king he went before the Lord and he he asked the Lord he said if you will just give me the Lord asked as Solomon what shall I give you and Solomon saids if you will give me wisdom to judge the people and to lead the people well and then God says not only will I give you wisdom because you requested this this Noble request not only will I give you that but I will also give you peace through your entire Reign and what brother Andrew is saying we know that the first time we see that wisdom you know when do you remember when it was with the baby and the two women and Solomon says so the the two women one of them rolled over on the on her baby and it died the other then she goes and she steals the one's baby they're sleeping in the same room she takes the one baby and she takes her dead baby and and puts it over next to the lady and then she walks wakes up she's like this isn't my baby that's my baby and then there's a big fight they come to the king and the King says cut the baby in half if they can't work it out did Olivia that's what he said Olivia gave me the was like what did they do it they didn't do it so what happened was the king said cut the baby in half and the real mother said no no no no no no she can have the baby because she really cared and the one that didn't that was not her baby she said yeah cut it in half so then we see the wisdom of Solomon but I would like to know that brother Andrew did that wisdom continue and did he accomplish what he wanted to do in serving Israel so there we have we have our first I don't know how many books brother ly musicians can come tell us something talking well regarding Solomon I've often thought that sometimes you have to be careful what you ask for I I think Soloman really cared about the people and he was seeking wisdom um and and and the Lord said I I'll give it to you so therefore I I believe that he had it but the Lord it I I always find it strange that the Lord said and I'm going to give you wealth and all that stuff but in Deuteronomy he says if you are a king forget about wealth and he specifically says no horses from Egypt and the first thing we read after that prayer is Solomon gets a bunch of horses from Egypt and and it's like the lord gave him wisdom for the people but not wisdom for his own life and and and so I think when we go before the Lord we need to be careful that that not only to be careful what we asked for but to be careful I don't want to I'm not sure how to say but to include oursel in some way if Solomon I think had included himself don't give me give me wisdom for the people and for my own life that I can be the right example I think the story might have been different that that's an opinion very good very good stat I um I don't mean this wrong but I do appreciate appreciate the mistakes that all of these people made it shows that they were human David was a prophet Not only was he a king and a man after God's Own Heart but he was a prophet and look at the mistakes that he made Solomon the most wise person ever and yet made many mistakes married the wrong girls did things wrong it just shows that we're human and we make mistakes but we can recover from those mistakes and we can move forward in our lives no more questions I've kept you brother Joe it's a that's a hard hard one to answer that's so brother Joe asked he said how can we Rec reconcile the Roman influence on what we call the Canon what we call the inspired word of God today and in short and I think that we should get into this question when we get into the New Testament but in short we have to trust that God is able to protect his word God's able to keep it and protect it but as I was preaching about this morning but God also requires us to pray about it there's many things in this Bible that are very hard to understand and if we pray about these things then he will give us that understanding and I think brother Joe I think that we should never leave out the influence of the holy spirit in reading our Bible because if we read it wrong we get these strange interpretations we get these Cults that are started we we we excommunicate people because they don't think like we [Music] do they don't follow our rules so when we take a couple scriptures and we misinterpret them and um cause all kinds of problems but we have to trust that the Lord God put this Bible together and used men of old men of renown Great Men of God to record it and to put it in place and then we also have to rely on the Holy Spirit as we read it that we don't interpret it wrong amen [Music] there is a soul in time of need that gives me hope that brings me peace in every trial through every T My Savior stand in my defend when the road you walk leaves you tired and War and your strength is gone and your heart feels SW remember call is greater than the
