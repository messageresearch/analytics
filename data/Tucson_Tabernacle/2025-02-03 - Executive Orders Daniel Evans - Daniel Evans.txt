[18:43] me you love the Lord this morning
[18:46] brother Daniel I asked him if we could I
[18:48] could share this
[18:49] testimony probably doesn't need much
[18:51] introduction but this is my uncle
[18:53] brother Russell Wallace shared this
[18:56] testimony on our family chat last night
[18:58] about 10 30 last
[19:00] night he says I have a testimony that is
[19:03] beyond any scientific explanation it is
[19:06] a miracle straight from the hand of God
[19:08] I'm ashamed to say that I can be a bit
[19:10] of a skeptic and my faith is often quite
[19:12] weak eight years ago when the good when
[19:14] fire swept through here I'll always
[19:16] remember the morning that the fire
[19:18] reached our property line Wesley his son
[19:21] and I got on the quad to take the back
[19:23] rout out of here and my faith was very
[19:25] weak I said to Wesley everything we have
[19:28] is going going to burn to the ground and
[19:30] there will be nothing left this is a
[19:32] precious memory I'll have forever Wesley
[19:34] said dad even if it wasn't God's will to
[19:37] preserve our property he would change
[19:39] his mind because so many Saints are
[19:41] praying there were Saints around the
[19:43] world praying and the fire came right up
[19:44] to their property line and then just
[19:46] went around their property one week ago
[19:49] you were all gracious enough to ask the
[19:50] Lord's blessings on the new well we are
[19:52] drill we were drilling I think this is
[19:54] their third well they've drilled in
[19:56] three or 30 about 30 years on their
[19:59] property as you recall I told you 10
[20:01] days ago that our old well had been
[20:03] diminishing for years and was the worst
[20:05] ever currently at less than one Court
[20:08] per minute I know this well like an old
[20:10] old friend for years now I have
[20:12] regularly tested the output and kept a
[20:15] chart in recent history in March 2022 we
[20:18] were at 8/10 of a gallon per minute in
[20:21] October of 20123 down to 66 gallons per
[20:26] minute and then in August of 2024
[20:29] 4.55 Gall per minute and then this month
[20:33] January was this past month 2025 was. 23
[20:38] gallons per minute so this has been our
[20:41] worst month ever with the well only
[20:43] producing 14 gallons per hour so here's
[20:46] the testimony this afternoon I went down
[20:48] to the well head to do another volume
[20:50] test for the test I bypassed the safety
[20:53] switch and kick the pump on full time in
[20:56] less than 10 minutes the water is all
[20:57] pumped out and the the pump starts
[20:59] sucking air I then turn it off let the
[21:03] well recharge for 15 minutes to turn
[21:06] turn it back on and check the volume
[21:08] today after 10 minutes it was not
[21:09] sucking air after an hour I it had still
[21:13] not pumped dry it's been on for 8 hours
[21:16] now and it is still not sucking air I
[21:19] checked our storage tanks and we have
[21:21] pumped 1,00 gallons in the last 8 hours
[21:23] this is an impossibility the
[21:25] impoverished well was only producing 112
[21:28] G in 8 hours it could be proposed that
[21:31] the new drilling activity affected the
[21:33] old well but there's no chance of that
[21:34] the new well is on is on the farthest
[21:37] northeast corner of our property 60
[21:39] Acres away from this one hope his
[21:42] granddaughter was quite excited and went
[21:44] down with me regularly to check the
[21:46] output today she said to me we were all
[21:49] praying for the new well and the Lord
[21:51] healed the old one too he says I'm so
[21:54] humbled and thankful to the Lord for a
[21:56] supernatural intervention and then this
[21:58] morning he posted this update at 7:00 a
[22:01] little after 7:00 this morning he says
[22:03] this morning's update our 3,000 gallons
[22:05] of storage tanks are all full and the
[22:08] water is overflowing onto the ground it
[22:10] is so surreal to be in the middle of a
[22:12] supernatural event thank you
[22:21] Lord what a
[22:23] testimony I imagine brother Daniel's
[22:25] going to have something to say about
[22:26] that if he wants to come out let's all
[22:28] stand to our feet and let's sing that
[22:30] old Hymn of the church only believe all
[22:34] things are possible no matter what it is

[26:37] you um that testimony from Brother
[26:42] Jordan uh you may know a little bit
[26:44] about your pastor you may know that I'm
[26:47] a I'm a a
[26:49] scientist um you may also know that not
[26:52] only am I a scientist but I'm an
[26:54] environmental scientist well what you
[26:57] probably don't know about me is I'm not

[27:02] a
[27:03] hydrologist that actually
[27:06] studies groundwater groundwater and
[27:08] surface water interaction groundwater
[27:10] flow through different aquifers and that
[27:13] and uh when brother Jordan read the um
[27:18] the
[27:19] testimony from his
[27:21] uncle uh the brother said that it's
[27:23] beyond any scientific
[27:26] explanation um well when I look at it I
[27:31] don't see any way that something like
[27:34] that could ever
[27:36] happen and when he says scientific
[27:39] explanation I mean without as a
[27:40] scientist you say well I haven't done a
[27:42] study on it I haven't collected these

[27:56] minute you can drink .23 gallons in a
[28:01] minute That's how little was coming out
[28:03] of that well and then I mean the
[28:06] granaries of Heaven just opened up and
[28:08] it just started pouring out water and
[28:11] filling up the
[28:12] tanks it's a miracle that's that's one
[28:15] of those real ones you know you you can
[28:18] you can question things we always want
[28:19] to give God credit and some but we don't
[28:22] we want to be careful we don't want to
[28:24] give God credit for something that he
[28:26] didn't do which is is often the case but
[28:30] wow that's impossible for that to have
[28:34] happened so yeah we got to be part of it
[28:36] and we've been praying for the family
[28:38] and uh we got to brother Aaron my
[28:41] prayers are in there so so praise God
[28:44] that was that was really really
[28:47] tremendous testimony um I
[28:51] uh I won't tell who wrote the note but
[28:56] brother Aaron gave me a note that he
[28:58] wrote from uh saying that it's Unison
[29:02] Sean's 14th
[29:11] anniversary dear friends personal
[29:14] friends to Stephanie and me and uh just
[29:17] just beloved loyal members of this
[29:20] church and and uh and precious family
[29:24] and
[29:26] um it's uh it's been a long road are you
[29:30] the same place you were 14 years
[29:33] ago God bless you I'm glad that we're
[29:36] where we are now brother Sean we still
[29:38] got a long way to go but we're on the
[29:41] we're on the right Road brother Lyle uh
[29:45] he uh he mentioned something last time
[29:47] he ministered on Wednesday night and uh
[29:51] I was like I'll brother a while and we
[29:52] kind of laughed at it when he said it
[29:54] but he uh the previous week he said
[29:58] uh and I forgot the the situation the
[30:00] story but he said you know it was like a
[30:02] bunch of government workers and and then
[30:06] and then the next week brother ly said
[30:08] listen I'm sorry that I said that I
[30:10] shouldn't have said that we all kind of
[30:12] laughed and um but uh then after that we
[30:16] started seeing the uh these all of these
[30:20] executive orders starting to come down
[30:23] from the
[30:24] president and uh it's it's really
[30:27] shaking things up in the government and
[30:30] it's uh some of these things are are
[30:32] kind of hard to accept and then other
[30:35] other ones are um are like well you know
[30:38] this this is really good but it's uh it
[30:42] it's been just amazing and that's what I
[30:44] want to talk about um in this sermon is
[30:48] is executive
[30:50] orders and one thing that uh president
[30:53] Trump did a couple weeks a couple days
[30:55] ago which I was really blessed with is
[30:58] he took he he gave an order to take the
[31:01] pronoun
[31:03] signature off of your emails that's a
[31:06] big deal that pronoun signature is
[31:10] basically us saying that I bow down to
[31:14] somebody who was maybe born a man and
[31:17] wants to be called a woman or born a
[31:19] woman or wants to be called a man or
[31:22] they they don't know what they
[31:24] are and it has been strongly encouraged
[31:27] as in the government brother Tony you're
[31:29] you're a fed too it's been strongly ENC
[31:33] encouraged in the government to put your
[31:36] pronouns on your signature
[31:39] page that's
[31:42] wrong what that is is saying you know
[31:45] what I bow down to someone being saying
[31:49] that they are not what God created them
[31:52] to
[31:53] be and it just it the whole thing is has
[31:57] made me sick and and Donald
[32:00] Trump said the other day take that off
[32:04] of your signature page I appreciate and
[32:08] admire that man's courage of course I'm
[32:11] not
[32:14] against I'm against sin homosexuality is
[32:18] a sin some people struggle with that
[32:22] other people struggle with lying other
[32:25] people struggle with with stealing other
[32:28] people struggle with um with adultery
[32:32] people struggle that sin I don't believe
[32:35] is necessarily any greater than the
[32:36] other but I don't have to bow down to
[32:38] any sin I don't put on I don't put on my
[32:41] signature page Daniel Evans
[32:44] liar or Daniel Evans thief and you got
[32:48] to accept it I don't do that and neither
[32:51] should we have to do this either so I
[32:54] really appreciate that executive order
[32:57] that the president president has has
[33:00] done and what he's doing is he's trying
[33:04] to rebuild our
[33:07] country and the reason this country is
[33:11] failing the reason any country fails is
[33:14] not necessarily because
[33:17] of financial decisions not necessarily
[33:22] because of military decisions the reason
[33:25] countries fail is because of sin
[33:28] in they fail because of dishonesty they
[33:31] fail because of immorality that's why
[33:34] they fail look through history and that
[33:36] is why a country fails and I appreciate
[33:40] our president trying to get us back on
[33:42] the right track I might not agree with
[33:44] him in everything and I've said a number
[33:47] of times from the pull pit that I don't
[33:50] necessarily
[33:51] support before now that he's president I
[33:54] fully support him because he's our
[33:55] president and the Bible teaches us that
[33:57] we should pray for our
[33:58] leaders but God bless him God bless him
[34:03] for trying and what we have seen is 60
[34:07] 70 years ago when brother Brandon was
[34:09] here we saw the enemy come in to society
[34:13] and come into the family and try to take
[34:16] the mother out of the family try to pull
[34:20] her out and that motherly influence on
[34:23] the children take her out and put her in
[34:26] the workforce put her away away from the
[34:28] family so that then the Satan the enemy
[34:30] could come in and get in the children
[34:33] and now we are seeing times
[34:36] change God doesn't change but times
[34:39] change now I believe we are seeing the
[34:41] same attack on the American
[34:44] man and we see that Satan if he knows
[34:47] that if he can get in and take out this
[34:51] man and
[34:53] demasculinize take away his
[34:56] manhood then we know then he knows that
[34:59] he's got the
[35:01] country the man has been degraded and
[35:07] put down more than ever in this past
[35:10] decade or so and I want to see strong
[35:13] men raise up I want to see Godly men
[35:16] raise up the man that will get his
[35:19] family together no matter how tired
[35:20] everybody is and how there's things
[35:23] going on on Netflix and we want to see
[35:24] all the this this all this other stuff
[35:27] get these this man get his family
[35:30] together and say we're going to read our
[35:31] Bible tonight we are going to pray as a
[35:34] family tonight we're going to pray this
[35:37] morning I want to see that return to our
[35:39] families I want to see a man stand up I
[35:43] want to see the power of the American
[35:45] male rise up
[35:49] again godly
[35:51] man I I just I see it in attack and this
[35:56] pronoun thing was just a another step to
[35:59] confuse this next
[36:01] Generation I appreciate somebody sent me
[36:03] a picture I appreciate um president
[36:06] Trump I heard this morning that he maybe
[36:09] is he has just signed a new
[36:13] um a new presidential order a new um
[36:20] executive
[36:22] order to get us back to church
[36:33] I love it
[36:35] man way to go
[36:40] Donald I know it's it's it's Photoshop
[36:47] but it's still it's still good I uh
[36:51] things are going on it's it's it's
[36:53] really it's really strange everything
[36:55] that's happening in the in the country
[36:57] in the world today but I I do appreciate
[36:59] I appreciate striking those pronouns I I
[37:02] appreciate the stand for the American
[37:04] worker the stand for the American Family
[37:07] the stand for men the stand for women
[37:09] and getting us right back on track you
[37:11] know as I was talking about these
[37:13] pronouns this isn't
[37:16] new Jesus said in Luke chapter 17 he
[37:20] says as it was in the days of
[37:23] Sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[37:26] the son of man as it was was in the days
[37:28] of Sodom show so shall it be in the
[37:30] second coming of Christ what was going
[37:32] on in Sodom homosexuality has has really
[37:35] it's always been here but what was going
[37:38] on in Sodom is the
[37:40] power of the homosexual Lobby you notice
[37:44] that
[37:45] lot I'm sorry it was I think it's as in
[37:48] the days of lot but it's the same thing
[37:50] lot was the governor of the
[37:53] city and remember when the homosexuals
[37:56] came to his house he was afraid of them
[38:01] even though he's the most powerful man
[38:03] in Sodom he was afraid of their voice he
[38:07] was afraid of their power and he tried
[38:10] to make deals with them and we and Jesus
[38:13] said when you see this start to raise up
[38:15] as it was in the days of lot then look
[38:19] because the second coming of Christ is
[38:20] at hand and here we are and I I just I
[38:23] do
[38:24] pray that this Administration that we
[38:27] have now we'll stay the wrath of God
[38:30] we'll bring back some semblance of
[38:32] godliness so we can continue this work
[38:35] and continue to bring people to the Lord
[38:37] Jesus it's
[38:39] instead it's they're they took prayer
[38:42] out of schools a long time ago because
[38:44] it was offensive but you replace it with
[38:48] transgender athletes and and with with
[38:51] swearing and and cussing and and with
[38:54] pornography and passing out birth
[38:56] control in the high school schools what
[38:58] message does that send to our young
[39:01] people it sends the message that sin is
[39:04] not
[39:06] sin and I I just I do
[39:08] appreciate that we have a little bit
[39:11] more boldness now in being able to serve
[39:16] the Lord and like I said I don't have
[39:18] I'm not against
[39:21] any certain group of people but I want
[39:25] godliness I want godliness in this
[39:27] church church and I want godliness where
[39:29] we work I want godliness in this country
[39:31] because God will continue to bless us if
[39:33] we have godliness if not we've gone
[39:36] through the Book of Judges we're going
[39:38] to see the same thing happen there well
[39:40] our country will be destroyed and it's
[39:42] destroyed from within from sin
[39:45] within um one of the executive orders
[39:49] that came down recently and brother Tony
[39:51] you probably got this one too that that
[39:53] we are not to um work remotely anymore
[39:59] meaning that we are not allowed
[40:02] to um work from
[40:05] home when we could go into the office or
[40:09] even if we can't go into the office
[40:10] there there won't be any more working
[40:12] for home from home and he's trying to
[40:14] increase productivity in the government
[40:16] and when you do that so he issued this
[40:18] executive order and when you do that
[40:22] it's issued at the top and this could be
[40:24] it doesn't have to be the government it
[40:25] could be the corporate world so this
[40:26] comes down from corporate that there
[40:29] will be no working from home anymore
[40:31] that you have to come into the office
[40:33] and as it trickles
[40:35] down questions start to come up and then
[40:39] there they're very valid questions uh
[40:42] like here's some of the questions that
[40:43] we've have what if I'm sick but I want
[40:45] to work I'm contagious but I want to
[40:49] work I need to get stuff done can I work
[40:50] from home or do I have to take a sick
[40:53] day and what if I only need to work a
[40:56] couple hours do I have to drive all the
[40:57] way into the office and work from there
[41:00] what if what if we're behind and I need
[41:02] to work on the weekends can I work from
[41:03] home doing that so the there's all these
[41:05] questions that come down and then
[41:08] they'll come down to finally they they
[41:11] trickle down they come down finally to
[41:13] the
[41:14] employee and this employee will have a
[41:17] set of questions and he will ask his
[41:21] boss or her boss what about this what
[41:27] about that what about if I'm sick what
[41:29] about this so then that boss will either
[41:33] answer the question and make a decision
[41:36] or send it back up the
[41:38] chain let's say in this case that the
[41:42] boss answers the question and let's say
[41:45] it's can I uh can I work at home on
[41:50] Friday then later
[41:53] on that person gets
[41:56] caught breaking the rule breaking the
[42:00] law breaking the executive order and
[42:02] here comes the enforcement down and says
[42:06] dan
[42:08] you on these days you have been working
[42:11] from home there was an executive order
[42:13] said you are not allowed to work from
[42:15] home so then Dan takes his email prints
[42:18] out his email and says no
[42:20] listen right here my boss approved me to
[42:24] do this so then that that responsibility
[42:28] now no longer rests on you it rests on
[42:32] the one who approved it the one who
[42:34] stood for you it's the same
[42:38] thing with
[42:41] sin you can say you swore you cussed
[42:45] whatever it might be or let's say you
[42:47] stole from you stole from work you came
[42:50] into the office and you took things that
[42:53] were owned by the company and you you
[42:56] took them for yourself and sold them and
[42:57] made money on them or whatever and then
[43:00] your
[43:01] boss comes in and he
[43:05] says you did this you stole it but I'm
[43:09] going to approve that that you were
[43:11] given this then when they come to get
[43:15] you again whether it be the police or
[43:18] whether it be the higher-ups to fire you
[43:20] or to put you in jail you said no no
[43:23] no here's my email from my boss I had
[43:26] permission to do that and then the
[43:31] punishment rests upon the person that
[43:34] approved it and that would be it would
[43:37] be resting on that person and that
[43:39] person would have to pay the bill would
[43:43] have to pay for what was stolen you
[43:45] tracking with me and it's the same for
[43:51] us the same with Jesus Christ the the
[43:56] third commandment
[43:57] the third executive order says you shall
[44:00] not take the name of the Lord in your
[44:01] God in vain for the Lord will not hold
[44:04] him Guiltless who takes his name in vain
[44:07] how many times have we heard somebody
[44:10] somebody say oh my God or Jesus Christ
[44:12] in a derogatory
[44:14] way right there you broke that executive
[44:18] order you broke that commandment and
[44:20] there must be punishment and the
[44:24] punishment for it would be death
[44:27] same with
[44:28] adultery if you committed
[44:31] adultery the Bible very plainly says
[44:34] that you are to be
[44:38] stoned but in this case somebody stepped
[44:43] in front and said no I'll take the blame
[44:47] for that I will take I will pay for the
[44:50] the sin I'll take the blame so when God
[44:53] the father comes down and says you have
[44:55] done this and you have done that you
[44:57] have sinned here you have sinned there
[44:58] you have sinned there my word my
[45:00] executive order which can't can't be
[45:03] done away with says that you must
[45:06] die and then something steps in someone
[45:10] steps in and says
[45:13] no it's my
[45:16] fault they're
[45:18] Justified I put my name on what they did
[45:23] and when you put your name on what they
[45:26] did if I put my name on one of my
[45:29] employees that stole something I say no
[45:31] I approve that now I have to pay the
[45:34] price and the price was death the price
[45:38] was
[45:39] hell and so my
[45:42] sins there was somebody that took my
[45:44] place and that price did not go
[45:47] unpaid that's the thing we don't think
[45:49] of very often every time I sin every
[45:53] time I do something wrong there must be
[45:55] a price paid because that was the
[45:58] executive order that was the Commandment
[46:01] somebody has to pay the price so now we
[46:03] have this one this Advocate comes in and
[46:05] says yeah I did it I'm responsible for
[46:10] it and he had to
[46:12] die he had to suffer what I should have
[46:17] suffered so these executive orders that
[46:19] we're seeing right now we've been
[46:21] talking about Parables it's a perfect
[46:24] example of a parable a parable Parable
[46:27] is something that you see every day that
[46:29] you relate to the word of
[46:33] God and we see executive orders coming
[46:35] down we see orders coming down from
[46:37] corporate that we all have to adhere to
[46:39] and if we don't do it there is
[46:40] punishment either we get fired we might
[46:42] get thrown in prison or whatever it
[46:44] might be the same with our lives we sin
[46:48] we do things wrong the executive order
[46:52] here says sin requires death
[46:57] and then somebody stepped
[46:59] in took my place and says I approved
[47:06] it I did it it's my fault and then we go
[47:11] we say
[47:13] father um he signed for
[47:17] me I'm
[47:20] Justified he had to Die the death that I
[47:22] should have
[47:23] died he had to be condemned of the sins
[47:27] that I did he had to be condemned of the
[47:29] most filthy things it might be
[47:31] homosexuality it might be pornography it
[47:33] might be stealing it might be lying it
[47:35] might be
[47:38] murder he did it and not me and that's
[47:42] what Jesus Christ means to
[47:45] us he took that
[47:49] place Matthew chapter 22
[47:58] Jesus if we truly do love Jesus Jesus
[48:01] said if you love
[48:02] me keep my Commandments Matthew
[48:06] 22 verse 34 I'll read out the new King
[48:09] James version says but when the
[48:11] Pharisees heard that he had silenced the
[48:14] Sadducees they gathered together then
[48:17] one of them a lawyer asked him a
[48:18] question testing him and saying teacher
[48:21] which is the great commandment in the
[48:23] law and Jesus said to him so he's saying
[48:26] what is the great executive
[48:29] order what's the most important of all
[48:31] these that have come down and Jesus
[48:34] answered and he say you shall love the
[48:35] Lord your God with all your heart with
[48:37] all your soul and with all your
[48:39] mind this is the first and great
[48:42] commandment and the second is like it
[48:44] you shall love your neighbor as yourself
[48:47] on these two Commandments hang all the
[48:50] law and the prophets so on these two
[48:54] executive
[48:55] orders h all of the Bible and all of the
[48:59] prophets if Jesus Is
[49:02] God which you believe he is
[49:05] right if Jesus Is God and he say he says
[49:10] if you love
[49:13] me remember it said Jesus said the first
[49:16] commandment the great commandment is to
[49:18] love the Lord God with all your heart
[49:19] and Jesus says if you love me then keep
[49:23] my
[49:24] Commandments basically if you you love
[49:27] me then do what I tell
[49:30] you and in the
[49:32] context it says his second
[49:35] commandment is to love each other and
[49:40] many of you don't know each other here
[49:42] so it's hard to love someone if you
[49:44] don't know them but it says it says to
[49:47] love your
[49:48] neighbor as yourself so you can't really
[49:51] love someone who you don't know but you
[49:54] can love someone who you do know whether
[49:57] you like them or not whether they're
[49:59] nice or not whether they get on your
[50:02] knee your nerves or not whether they do
[50:06] you right or they do you wrong if you
[50:09] know them then you are obligated to love
[50:14] them like you know your neighbor if you
[50:17] know your neighbor some of us don't know
[50:19] our neighbors very well but we know
[50:21] them so if you know your neighbor then
[50:24] you certainly know each other and we
[50:26] have to love one
[50:28] another and some of God's executive
[50:30] orders are truly truly awesome he gave
[50:34] those orders to us and we we we hear God
[50:39] and we see okay Lord you taught us out
[50:41] of this Bible to do these things and to
[50:44] set aside everything else and to
[50:46] concentrate on those and let these
[50:48] things from this Bible let them take
[50:51] preeminence over everything over my own
[50:52] desires over whatever I want to do but
[50:56] he also o had some really some pretty
[51:00] stellar executive orders and I'll read a
[51:02] few of them and uh you don't have to
[51:04] follow me back there because I'll go
[51:06] fast Genesis
[51:08] 1:3 God said let there be
[51:11] light and there was light an executive
[51:15] order straight down from God I love it
[51:17] let there be light and the there was
[51:20] light and God saw the light that it was
[51:22] good and God divided the light from the
[51:24] darkness and he called the day day in
[51:26] the darkness he called night so the
[51:28] evening and the morning were the first
[51:30] day what a commandment it's really the
[51:33] first one in the whole Bible he says let
[51:36] there be
[51:37] light and a place that was dark became
[51:40] light Genesis 1:26 it says this then God
[51:44] said let us make man in our own image
[51:47] according to our
[51:49] likeness let let them have dominion over
[51:51] the fish and the Sea over the over the
[51:53] birds of the air and over the cattle and
[51:54] over all the Earth and over every
[51:55] creeping thing that creep us so God
[51:57] created man in his own image in the
[51:59] image of God created he him male and
[52:01] female created he them all of us are in
[52:04] that boys and girls men and
[52:08] women and how that we are created in the
[52:11] very image of God and if he created us
[52:14] to be like him then shouldn't we be like
[52:17] him Abraham in Genesis 17 when Abram was
[52:21] 99 years
[52:23] old the Lord appeared to Abram and said
[52:26] to him him another
[52:29] commandment I am almighty God walk
[52:33] before me and be
[52:36] blameless and I will make my Covenant
[52:38] between me and you and I will multiply
[52:41] you exceedingly then Abram fell on his
[52:43] face and God talked with him saying as
[52:46] for me behold my Covenant is with
[52:50] you and you shall be a father of many
[52:52] nations a man who couldn't have children
[52:57] we know the story God created
[53:01] the Jewish race and well really all all
[53:04] the race is right
[53:05] there and then when
[53:09] Abraham showing that that this promised
[53:11] son that he just Pro he just promised
[53:13] him right there this promised son was
[53:16] born then God tells Abraham go up and
[53:19] sacrifice your
[53:21] son lay him on the altar get a bunch of
[53:24] sticks just like you would a lamb or a
[53:28] ram get a bunch of sticks take this
[53:30] sacrifice like you would a a ram slice
[53:34] his throat kill him and then burn
[53:37] him Abraham does so and when
[53:43] Abraham but the angel when when Abraham
[53:46] laid him there he raised up the knife to
[53:49] kill his son now listen to this
[53:51] executive order and this one came right
[53:52] at the last
[53:54] minute but the angel of the Lord called
[53:56] him to him from heaven and and said Abra
[53:58] Abraham Abraham and he says here am I he
[54:02] said don't lay your hand on the lad or
[54:04] do anything to him for now I know that
[54:06] you fear God since you have withheld
[54:09] your son your only son from
[54:12] me Jacob at
[54:15] bethl in Genesis
[54:18] 2811 so he came to a certain place and
[54:21] stayed there all night because the sun
[54:23] had set and he took one of the stones of
[54:26] that place and put his put it at his
[54:28] head and he lay down in that place to
[54:32] sleep then he
[54:36] dreamed and behold a ladder was set up
[54:39] on the earth and its top reached to
[54:42] heaven and there the angels of God were
[54:45] ascending and descending on it and
[54:48] behold the Lord stood above it and
[54:51] said an executive order from the king
[54:55] from God himself I am the Lord God of
[54:58] Abraham your father and the god of Isaac
[55:01] the land which you
[55:03] lie you're laying on now I will give to
[55:07] you and to your
[55:09] descendants also to your descendants
[55:11] shall be as the the dust of the earth
[55:14] you shall spread abroad to the to the
[55:16] west and and the East and the North and
[55:18] the South and in you and in your seed
[55:23] all the families of the Earth shall be
[55:25] blessed
[55:27] behold I am with you it's God speaking
[55:30] executive order from the top behold I am
[55:34] with you and will keep you wherever you
[55:36] go and when will bring you back to this
[55:39] land for I will not leave you until I
[55:43] have done that which I have spoken to
[55:45] you then Jacob awoke from his sleep and
[55:48] said surely the Lord is in this place
[55:51] and I did not know it and he was afraid
[55:54] and said how awesome is this
[55:57] place this is none other than the house
[56:00] of God and this is the Gate of
[56:04] Heaven and then still to this day being
[56:08] fulfilled we see two a 2,000 years span
[56:10] where Israel this promise that that God
[56:13] made to him Israel Was Defeated and
[56:16] spread around the world and then
[56:18] recently in the 1940s we see that Israel
[56:24] fulfilling this prophecy that God made
[56:27] I'll bring you
[56:28] back and forming another another Nation
[56:31] a powerful nation and now we're all
[56:34] blessed because of it because of this
[56:36] nation Moses at the burning bush in
[56:40] Exodus 3 Moses goes down and and he sees
[56:43] this bush burning and he goes down and
[56:44] he bows down before
[56:47] it and God says I am the god of your
[56:50] father the god of Abraham the god of
[56:52] Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid
[56:54] his face for he was afraid to look upon
[56:56] God and the Lord said I have surely seen
[56:59] the oppression of my people who are in
[57:01] Egypt the story of The Exodus coming out
[57:03] from bondage so I have come down to
[57:06] deliver them out of the hand of the
[57:08] Egyptians and to bring them up from that
[57:10] land to a good and large land to a land
[57:12] flowing with milk and honey to a place
[57:15] of the Canaanites and the Hittites and
[57:17] the amorites and the pites and the hites
[57:19] and the jebusites now therefore Behold
[57:21] The Cry of the children of Israel has
[57:24] come to me
[57:26] same as our cries come before him when
[57:29] we cry out
[57:30] sayl help my well on my property Lord
[57:35] help my sick son or my sick daughter
[57:38] Lord help me and he says I hear the
[57:42] cries of my people an executive order
[57:44] from the
[57:46] top and I have also seen the oppression
[57:48] which the Egyptians oppressed them now
[57:51] come therefore and I will send you to
[57:53] Pharaoh that you may bring my people the
[57:55] children of Israel out of
[57:57] Egypt there's a lot of them but I'll
[58:01] I'll finish with this one on the
[58:03] executive orders from God Isaiah chapter
[58:06] 7 verse1
[58:08] 14 one of the most important orders one
[58:12] of the most important thing that God set
[58:14] forward
[58:16] therefore the Lord
[58:18] himself will give you a sign
[58:22] Behold a the Virgin shall conceive and
[58:25] bear a son
[58:26] and shall call his name
[58:29] Emmanuel and Emanuel means god with us
[58:34] and 740 or so years later this executive
[58:38] order came to pass this commandment came
[58:41] to
[58:43] pass but how was This Promise This
[58:47] commandment this man this Messiah to be
[58:50] manifest itself really how's it to
[58:53] manifest itself in my life
[58:56] and how could it save me how could he
[58:58] save me from my sins Matthew chap
[59:02] 1:8 let's go
[59:09] there familiar Christmas scripture but a
[59:13] very good one for this on God's
[59:15] executive orders now the birth of Jesus
[59:17] Christ was on this wise when he when as
[59:19] his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph
[59:21] before they came together she was found
[59:23] with ch a child of the Holy Ghost
[59:26] then Joseph her husband being a just man
[59:29] and not willing to make her a public
[59:31] example was minded to put her away privy
[59:34] but while he thought on these things
[59:37] behold the angel of the Lord appeared
[59:39] unto him in a
[59:40] dream saying Joseph th son of David fear
[59:44] not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for
[59:47] that which is conceived in her is of the
[59:49] Holy
[59:51] Ghost and she brought forth a
[59:54] son and thou shalt and and she shall
[59:57] bring forth a son and thou shalt call
[1:00:00] his name Jesus for he shall save his
[1:00:04] people from their sins this is the order
[1:00:06] that came down I am sending this one you
[1:00:10] will call his name Jesus because he will
[1:00:13] save them from their sins the the very
[1:00:16] word Jesus comes from the Hebrew word we
[1:00:20] pronounce it Joshua
[1:00:23] Yeshua it means savior
[1:00:27] now all this was done that it might be
[1:00:29] fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord
[1:00:31] by Spoken of the Lord by the prophet
[1:00:34] saying Behold a virgin shall be with
[1:00:35] child and shall bring forth a son and
[1:00:38] they shall call his name Emmanuel which
[1:00:41] is being interpreted God With Us I
[1:00:44] talked about the mediator between the
[1:00:48] law that comes down the executive order
[1:00:50] that comes down and the law breaker the
[1:00:54] mediator that that stands in the place
[1:00:56] of the person who stole from the company
[1:00:59] but someone else paid the price the
[1:01:01] scripture says and he shall save his
[1:01:04] people from their
[1:01:07] sins now let's get into how this is
[1:01:12] implemented to me how it's implemented
[1:01:15] to you how it was implemented in the
[1:01:18] past in St John chapter 8 this is going
[1:01:21] to be so now the executive order came
[1:01:23] down you can't work at home or whatever
[1:01:25] it might might be it came down and now
[1:01:27] it's down to the employee to the
[1:01:30] government employee or the corporate
[1:01:32] employee in this case it comes down to
[1:01:35] one of God's elect one of God's people
[1:01:39] St John 8 verse one Jesus went up under
[1:01:44] the Mount of Olives early and early in
[1:01:46] the morning he came into the temple and
[1:01:48] all the people came unto him and he sat
[1:01:51] down and taught them and the scribes and
[1:01:52] the Pharisees brought unto him a woman
[1:01:55] taken in adultery and when they had set
[1:01:58] her in their midst they said unto him
[1:02:01] Master this woman was taken in adultery
[1:02:05] in the very
[1:02:07] act now Moses in the law commanded us
[1:02:10] we're going to hear the seventh
[1:02:11] commandment here now Moses in the law
[1:02:14] commanded us that such should be stoned
[1:02:18] what sayest
[1:02:19] thou this they said tempting him that
[1:02:22] they might have accused him but Jesus St
[1:02:26] down and with his finger wrote on the
[1:02:27] ground as though he heard them not so he
[1:02:32] ignored them when they said it and
[1:02:34] they're like Hey listen the the the
[1:02:37] executive order comes down the command
[1:02:39] the seventh commandment came down from
[1:02:40] Jehovah God himself through the prophet
[1:02:43] Moses now Jesus what are you going to do
[1:02:46] about it and they knew that Jesus loved
[1:02:49] the
[1:02:49] people they knew that he had a burden
[1:02:52] for sinners in fact they criticized him
[1:02:55] for for fellowshipping with
[1:02:58] Sinners so when they continued asking
[1:03:01] him he lifted up
[1:03:04] himself and said unto them he that is
[1:03:07] without sin among you let
[1:03:11] him first cast a stone at her so there
[1:03:14] they are standing there they're ready to
[1:03:17] exact judgment on this woman judgment
[1:03:20] according to the
[1:03:23] Bible and he again stooped down and rode
[1:03:26] on the ground and they which heard it
[1:03:29] being convicted by their own conscience
[1:03:31] thank God that they had a
[1:03:33] conscience convicted by their own
[1:03:35] conscience show that there was something
[1:03:36] in
[1:03:37] them went out one by one beginning at
[1:03:40] the eldest probably the
[1:03:43] wisest and even unto the last and Jesus
[1:03:47] was left alone and the woman standing in
[1:03:50] the midst when Jesus had lifted up
[1:03:53] himself and saw none but the woman he
[1:03:56] said unto her woman where are those
[1:03:58] thine accusers hath no man condemned
[1:04:02] thee imagine how she felt there she was
[1:04:06] she deserved it don't forget we always
[1:04:09] want to talk about this woman as as
[1:04:12] being um you know just a blessing and
[1:04:15] and being sweet and and being innocent
[1:04:17] and all that she was not
[1:04:18] innocent she was a
[1:04:22] sinner sleeping with another woman
[1:04:26] husband and caught in the very act you
[1:04:28] know I've heard the question asked well
[1:04:30] where was the man in all this how come
[1:04:33] he didn't get punished you don't know
[1:04:34] that he didn't get punished he may have
[1:04:37] very well been stoned he may have very
[1:04:39] well been killed or he may have got away
[1:04:41] with it somehow but the fact is that
[1:04:43] this is that this is concentrating on
[1:04:45] this woman because she was a Believer I
[1:04:48] believe if the man was a Believer he'd
[1:04:50] probably be written in
[1:04:52] here but this woman was real
[1:04:56] she was she was
[1:04:58] special she said where are thine
[1:05:01] accusers she said no man Lord and Jesus
[1:05:04] said to her neither do I condemn thee go
[1:05:06] and sin no
[1:05:08] more so the adulterous woman who
[1:05:10] according to the letter of the law the
[1:05:13] letter of the executive order should
[1:05:15] have been stoned to death but as this
[1:05:17] trickled down this this commandment came
[1:05:21] down from God and she was at the person
[1:05:24] that deals directly with her this man
[1:05:26] Jesus Christ there is no mediator
[1:05:28] between God between God and man except
[1:05:30] for the man Christ Jesus and here is a
[1:05:33] perfect example of that
[1:05:35] woman dealing as we would say directly
[1:05:40] with her
[1:05:41] boss and him taking him taking the
[1:05:45] responsibility for it and he says
[1:05:48] here right neither do I condemn you
[1:05:53] you're justified in this
[1:05:58] then spake Jesus and
[1:06:00] then neither do I condemn thee and then
[1:06:03] he says this go and sin no
[1:06:08] more you know if you keep doing it then
[1:06:11] you're showing I really don't believe in
[1:06:13] my salvation I really don't believe in
[1:06:15] this so I'm going to just keep doing
[1:06:16] this because it's not really real to me
[1:06:18] but Jesus says no he doesn't just give
[1:06:20] her a cart Blan he says don't do it
[1:06:22] again don't sin anymore then Jesus spake
[1:06:26] unto them saying I am the light of the
[1:06:29] world he that followeth me shall not
[1:06:32] walk in darkness but shall have the
[1:06:34] light of Life he's saying that I am the
[1:06:37] Fulfillment of the law I am the word
[1:06:39] made flesh I am the light of the world I
[1:06:41] am the one who brings understanding to
[1:06:43] the word I am the one who brings the
[1:06:46] spirit of the law to your understanding
[1:06:49] if we just follow the letter of the law
[1:06:52] in in Le in legal terms you have the
[1:06:53] spirit of the law which is what we
[1:06:55] should be doing and then you have the
[1:06:57] letter of the law and no one can survive
[1:07:00] the letter of the law but God wrote the
[1:07:02] law in a certain spirit and it wasn't to
[1:07:06] destroy God wrote this the the law in
[1:07:09] the Holy Spirit and it was for
[1:07:11] salvation so that means you don't take
[1:07:14] the Ten Commandments now you don't take
[1:07:15] the Old Testament I hear so often well
[1:07:17] that's Old Testament we have Grace now
[1:07:20] that's true to a certain extent but we
[1:07:22] still do have that Old Testament Jesus
[1:07:26] said that thou shalt not commit adultery
[1:07:28] as I said the seventh commandment but
[1:07:30] then he said but you still commit
[1:07:33] adultery if you look at a woman and you
[1:07:36] want to have an affair with that woman
[1:07:39] you're still committing adultery that's
[1:07:42] the
[1:07:43] spirit of the law you may not have done
[1:07:46] it but you're still guilty if we walked
[1:07:49] in the spirit of the law then we
[1:07:51] wouldn't have to worry about the letter
[1:07:52] of the law because we wouldn't be
[1:07:54] sinning because we would know that that
[1:07:56] spirit is speaking through me I
[1:07:58] shouldn't say this because that's a
[1:08:00] lie and then that we wouldn't need
[1:08:02] forgiveness of that sin if we walk in
[1:08:05] the spirit of the law but the letter of
[1:08:08] the law is hard and it says you lied
[1:08:11] you're going to
[1:08:13] hell but if we walk in the spirit of the
[1:08:16] law we see that oh I'm getting
[1:08:19] close and if you walked in the if if
[1:08:22] people that cheat on their wives or
[1:08:24] cheat on their husband if they would
[1:08:25] walked in the spirit of the of the law
[1:08:28] they wouldn't have even got close to
[1:08:30] that because Jesus said if you just if
[1:08:32] you just want to if you just desire to
[1:08:35] that you've committed adultery with her
[1:08:37] already in your heart then you would not
[1:08:39] step over that line because you know
[1:08:42] that this this spirit this holy spirit
[1:08:44] that wrote the law I need to stay far
[1:08:46] away from
[1:08:48] that that's the difference between the
[1:08:50] letter and the spirit Jesus produced the
[1:08:53] spirit
[1:08:56] the Pharisees said to him thou bearest
[1:08:59] record of
[1:09:01] thyself thy record is not true so when
[1:09:04] we have an executive when we have an
[1:09:07] executive order the seventh commandment
[1:09:09] Thou shalt not commit adultery then you
[1:09:11] should be stoned this came down from the
[1:09:13] headquarters and they said listen your
[1:09:15] testimony isn't true because she should
[1:09:17] be stoned you're speaking of yourself
[1:09:20] you're wrong Jesus and Jesus answered
[1:09:23] them and said though I be record of
[1:09:26] myself yet my record is true for I know
[1:09:29] whence I came and whether I go but I
[1:09:31] cannot tell whence I come and whether I
[1:09:34] go you judge after the flesh now listen
[1:09:37] to this this is good you judge after the
[1:09:41] flesh but I judge no man you know why he
[1:09:44] judges no man because he was
[1:09:47] judged he was judged for me he was judge
[1:09:49] for you he took the
[1:09:52] judgment and yet if I judge
[1:09:56] my judgment is true for I am not alone
[1:09:59] but I and the and the father that sent
[1:10:01] me he's saying that I'm not in this by
[1:10:02] myself I and the father are one we're in
[1:10:05] this
[1:10:07] together so
[1:10:09] why
[1:10:11] is if we are in this together and we
[1:10:15] look and Jesus went to the cross for us
[1:10:19] he took that blame so why is the cross
[1:10:23] so important why do we have it sitting
[1:10:26] here in the back of the in the back of
[1:10:28] the church why do you see crosses on
[1:10:29] Christian churches because it's
[1:10:32] everything it's when the
[1:10:36] law came down I should have been judged
[1:10:38] I should go to hell as all of you
[1:10:42] should and any person that's really
[1:10:44] walked the earth except for Jesus Christ
[1:10:46] we should all be condemned but because
[1:10:49] of the Cross because he went there and
[1:10:51] he took that that punishment for me I
[1:10:55] don't have to
[1:10:56] go and then he says to the woman he says
[1:11:00] now go and sin no more don't do it again
[1:11:02] look at what I did for you and if you
[1:11:05] really love that person that that take
[1:11:07] that took that from you would you want
[1:11:09] to keep doing it so he has to keep
[1:11:11] taking your blows and he has to keep
[1:11:14] paying your debt if you really love
[1:11:16] Jesus
[1:11:18] no you wouldn't want to do it he says if
[1:11:22] you love me keep my Commandments why
[1:11:25] would he say that I'm going to keep
[1:11:27] having to answer for you I'm going to
[1:11:30] keep having to take your punishment if
[1:11:32] you love me keep my Commandments your
[1:11:35] life will be
[1:11:37] better and you'll be a better you
[1:11:39] everything will be better and then you
[1:11:42] won't be
[1:11:44] always you you won't always be
[1:11:48] condemned by the grace of God we not
[1:11:56] the Lord
[1:12:00] Jesus he turned he came with a message
[1:12:03] that just turned everything upside down
[1:12:05] people had never heard the things that
[1:12:07] he he said he
[1:12:10] says if someone hates you then you love
[1:12:13] that person these are Commandments these
[1:12:15] are executive orders from Jesus if
[1:12:17] someone hates you then you love that
[1:12:19] person someone steals from you then you
[1:12:21] give them more than they stole pray pray
[1:12:25] for your enemies not just your friends
[1:12:28] who are having trouble that means pray
[1:12:30] for the weasel young man who's trying to
[1:12:32] take your daughter
[1:12:34] out that's rough and don't kill him
[1:12:38] either it's another
[1:12:41] commandment I've gotten
[1:12:43] close pray for the IRS agent who's
[1:12:47] auditing your
[1:12:49] taxes pray for the person who is
[1:12:51] tormenting you at work pray for the
[1:12:53] woman who's gossiping about about you
[1:12:56] pray for that person who is a problem to
[1:12:58] you Jesus commands it it's an executive
[1:13:01] order you have to pray for them you have
[1:13:03] to help them even if you can't stand
[1:13:06] them and you need to love them so change
[1:13:10] the way that you think Executive Order
[1:13:14] says Thou shalt not
[1:13:16] covet and Jesus is very plain remember
[1:13:19] he turned everything upside down the
[1:13:21] thing that you want the most in the
[1:13:23] world sacrifice I your desire for that
[1:13:27] thing to
[1:13:29] God again straight from the top don't
[1:13:33] covet the thing that you want the most
[1:13:36] thing that you desire the most give it
[1:13:38] to God it may be your
[1:13:40] family it may be
[1:13:44] riches may be popularity it may be a
[1:13:47] position it may be a job
[1:13:50] Lord I give it to you I'm going to work
[1:13:53] as hard as I can I'm going to do
[1:13:54] everything that I can I want to I want
[1:13:56] to be right but in the end Lord I give
[1:14:00] my desires to you we went on Wednesday
[1:14:02] night we talked about prayer and the key
[1:14:05] to prayer and the key to having your
[1:14:08] pray prayer answered is to get down
[1:14:11] before the Lord and get into the spirit
[1:14:13] of God so now it's not your desires not
[1:14:17] your Covetous desires that you want
[1:14:18] something but now God begins to speak
[1:14:22] through you and it becomes his will
[1:14:25] and that's the key to
[1:14:29] prayer and that's the key to every
[1:14:31] that's that's the key don't covet if you
[1:14:33] want something give it over to God
[1:14:35] remember I gave my heart to the Lord
[1:14:36] when I was 21 my 21st birthday and the
[1:14:39] thing that I asked I want to get married
[1:14:41] I wouldn't have a family the one thing I
[1:14:43] ask God I said Lord I'm giving my life
[1:14:46] to you I'm not living this sinful life
[1:14:48] anymore would you give me a
[1:14:51] wife and I said but even if you don't
[1:14:55] I'm still going to serve you for the
[1:14:56] rest of my
[1:14:58] life that's and then he gave me the best
[1:15:01] wife I could ever have imagined I never
[1:15:03] I never knew being married could be so
[1:15:06] great but I sacrificed and I was fully
[1:15:09] willing if if I never get married it's
[1:15:11] fine Lord I'm going to serve you now in
[1:15:15] closing I want to go through this
[1:15:17] Parable we've been go we've started on
[1:15:18] the series of Parables and I think it
[1:15:20] goes well and that's the parable of the
[1:15:23] tower Luke chapter 14:25 it's probably
[1:15:26] one that that if you don't read your
[1:15:28] Bible um a lot you probably don't even
[1:15:31] know this Parable Luke 14 verse
[1:15:35] 25 and there went great multitudes with
[1:15:38] them and he turned and said unto them
[1:15:42] now let me just stop right there and
[1:15:44] there went great multitudes with Jesus
[1:15:47] so there's thousands of people with him
[1:15:49] remember that when he fed the 5,000
[1:15:51] there's 5,000 people and here it says
[1:15:55] there's great multitudes so there's all
[1:15:56] of these thousands of people they're
[1:15:58] they're all following him and he's going
[1:16:01] along and all of a sudden he
[1:16:03] turns and he said to them so the spirit
[1:16:07] must have said tell them this very
[1:16:10] important he turned right around and all
[1:16:12] of these thousands of people started
[1:16:14] listening let me ask you this if there
[1:16:17] were thou thousands and thousands are
[1:16:19] following Jesus all the
[1:16:21] time why why were there only 12 in the
[1:16:25] upper
[1:16:27] room think about
[1:16:29] that all of these people following Jesus
[1:16:32] and all when he came into Jerusalem on
[1:16:34] his on his on the on the donkey and they
[1:16:36] were singing hosan and throwing their
[1:16:38] garments and throwing the Palm leaves on
[1:16:40] PA Palm Sunday this triumphant King and
[1:16:43] all the whole city was was celebrating
[1:16:46] why only 120 of them stayed with it
[1:16:53] wow Jesus turned
[1:16:55] with all of these people and he said If
[1:16:57] any man come to me and hates not his
[1:17:00] father and mother and wife and children
[1:17:03] and brother and
[1:17:05] sister yay and his own life also he
[1:17:08] cannot be my
[1:17:10] disciple
[1:17:12] that's Jesus is that's a I think it's
[1:17:15] called by the Jewish idiom it means
[1:17:18] something else he's not saying that you
[1:17:21] have to hate anybody what he is saying
[1:17:24] is that you that Jesus first of all he
[1:17:27] was all about love and he told us many
[1:17:29] times not to hate he's saying that if
[1:17:31] you don't love them less than you love
[1:17:35] me then you're not worthy of me love
[1:17:39] them less love everything less than you
[1:17:41] love me if you want to be my disciple
[1:17:45] and I I know that because it tells the
[1:17:47] same story there's a parallel scripture
[1:17:48] in Matthew 10 you don't have to turn
[1:17:50] there we can stay in Luke Matthew 10:37
[1:17:52] says this he that loveth father or
[1:17:55] mother more than me is not worthy of me
[1:17:57] and he that loveth son or daughter more
[1:17:59] than me is not worthy of me basically
[1:18:02] Jesus needs to be the first person in
[1:18:03] our
[1:18:06] life and
[1:18:08] whosoever does not bear his cross and
[1:18:12] come after me cannot be my
[1:18:15] disciple what does that mean bear the
[1:18:18] cross the cross was the most feared
[1:18:22] thing in the Roman Empire it was this
[1:18:26] heartless
[1:18:28] terrible punishment it struck fear into
[1:18:31] everyone when you saw someone carrying a
[1:18:33] cross down the road you knew that person
[1:18:37] was condemned to death that person is
[1:18:39] soon going to be hanging up there and
[1:18:41] dying a slow painful death the most
[1:18:43] painful death that the Romans had was
[1:18:46] the
[1:18:47] cross so you see somebody walking with
[1:18:49] the cross to the city you know that
[1:18:52] person is going to suffer like you would
[1:18:55] never believe and then Jesus says if
[1:18:58] you don't take up your cross and follow
[1:19:02] after me then you're not worthy of
[1:19:11] Me Jesus said earlier in Luke he makes a
[1:19:15] statement we'll stay in Luke 14 but in
[1:19:17] Luke
[1:19:18] 99 he says and he said to them all if
[1:19:21] anyone desires to come after me let him
[1:19:25] deny himself and take up his cross
[1:19:29] daily and follow me this is not a
[1:19:32] one-time thing I can't go back to the
[1:19:34] day I gave my heart to the Lord Jesus I
[1:19:36] can't go back to my 21st birthday Jesus
[1:19:39] requires more than that he requires
[1:19:42] every day going back to the day that we
[1:19:44] gave our heart to the Lord going back to
[1:19:46] that we have to be careful that we'll
[1:19:48] just stay
[1:19:49] there that is the beginning of a journey
[1:19:54] that go goes on really into eternity
[1:19:56] every day should be serving the lord
[1:19:59] every day should be taking up that cross
[1:20:02] and following him you may you may go
[1:20:05] back to the to the day that you came to
[1:20:07] the altar you may come back to the day
[1:20:08] that you spoke in tongues or you were
[1:20:10] filled with the Holy Spirit but you need
[1:20:12] to keep going past that how can you move
[1:20:15] Beyond it how can you have a closer walk
[1:20:17] with Jesus it's if it's not an everyday
[1:20:20] thing I know that we can go back to
[1:20:23] those times as as a point of faith and I
[1:20:26] do
[1:20:27] often but continue on and Jesus said you
[1:20:31] bear that cross that
[1:20:34] shame you bear it every
[1:20:39] day he requires
[1:20:42] that and we wonder why we haven't moved
[1:20:45] past we wonder why we haven't
[1:20:48] progressed as a body of
[1:20:51] Believers as Christianity why why have
[1:20:55] we not
[1:20:57] progressed because you're not taking up
[1:20:59] your cross
[1:21:01] daily every day and following him the
[1:21:04] musicians could
[1:21:07] come and uh I'll be a few more minutes
[1:21:10] and sister Jessica also Galatians 2:20
[1:21:13] says I have been crucified with
[1:21:16] Christ it is no longer I who live but
[1:21:19] Christ lives in me and the life which I
[1:21:22] now live in the flesh I live by faith in
[1:21:25] the Son of God who loved me and gave
[1:21:27] himself for me I do not set aside the
[1:21:29] grace of God he's saying I don't set
[1:21:32] aside that for if righteousness comes
[1:21:35] through the law then Christ died in vain
[1:21:38] if righteousness comes down just from
[1:21:40] that executive order then Christ done
[1:21:42] died in vain because we all fall
[1:21:45] short but it's that Spirit of the law
[1:21:49] that Jesus Christ fulfilled and then he
[1:21:52] paid the price back to Luke ver vers
[1:21:56] 28 for which of you intending to build a
[1:21:59] tower said is not on let's uh sister L
[1:22:02] let's wait just a minute um for which of
[1:22:04] you intending to build a tower sth not
[1:22:07] down first and cth the cost whether he
[1:22:10] have sufficient to finish it lest
[1:22:13] happily after he laid the foundation and
[1:22:15] is not able to finish it all that be
[1:22:18] that behold it begin to mock him saying
[1:22:20] this man began to build and was not able
[1:22:23] to finish so he's saying and you start
[1:22:25] this journey you make this decision
[1:22:28] right that this is going to be your life
[1:22:31] and you are going to finish this this
[1:22:33] whole thing and you're going to be
[1:22:36] completely surrendered to Christ do you
[1:22:39] ever see that Stephanie and I moved away
[1:22:42] in I don't know what was it like
[1:22:45] 2004 that we moved to Jeffersonville and
[1:22:48] before we moved there was this guy on I
[1:22:52] 10 that uh he bought all of this land on
[1:22:55] the west side of I 10 between Tucson and
[1:22:57] Phoenix and he had he started putting up
[1:23:00] these towers in the desert you've seen
[1:23:03] it if you have ever driven there and he
[1:23:05] was putting up signs that said wanted
[1:23:09] used Carnival equipment and he wanted to
[1:23:11] build this this great big amusement park
[1:23:15] well he put up some towers and and when
[1:23:18] Stephanie and I came back we're drive
[1:23:22] driving through Phoenix it's like wow
[1:23:25] the towers are still there and the guy
[1:23:29] did absolutely nothing over the past 17
[1:23:33] years and he becomes a laughing stock
[1:23:37] you started this
[1:23:39] project but you won't finish it you
[1:23:43] started being a Christian but does
[1:23:45] everybody at your school see you as a
[1:23:47] Christian does everybody at your work
[1:23:50] see you as a
[1:23:51] Christian or do you become a laughing
[1:23:54] star
[1:23:55] do they make fun of you they should be
[1:23:57] looking up to you and admiring you or
[1:24:01] what king is going to make war against
[1:24:03] another king sth not down first and
[1:24:05] consult whether he be able with 10,000
[1:24:09] to meet him that cometh against him with
[1:24:12] 20,000 or else while the other is yet
[1:24:15] AAR off he sendeth an ambassage and
[1:24:19] desired desireth conditions of Peace So
[1:24:21] what he's saying here is if you're going
[1:24:23] to go to battle with this other Army you
[1:24:27] better be ready because if you're the
[1:24:29] King Kings were not treated well after
[1:24:31] they lost a battle in the
[1:24:32] Bible you know that um zedekiah I
[1:24:36] believe it was lost the battle with
[1:24:39] Nebuchadnezzar Here Comes NE
[1:24:41] Nebuchadnezzar lines up his sons kills
[1:24:44] them all in front of him then gouges out
[1:24:47] his eyes in other places they would
[1:24:50] parade this King through through the
[1:24:53] through the The Village or through the
[1:24:55] kingdom have people put their foot on
[1:24:57] his neck because he lost this battle
[1:25:00] he's saying before you go you better
[1:25:02] weigh this out this is an important
[1:25:04] important decision that's how it is with
[1:25:07] us I put up the
[1:25:09] funny picture of trump quit skipping
[1:25:12] church church is part of it church is
[1:25:17] important consider the consequences of
[1:25:20] ignoring the executive order to take up
[1:25:23] your cross and follow Jesus consider the
[1:25:26] consequences of not forgiving your
[1:25:28] brother consider the consequences of
[1:25:30] speaking gossip about a sister consider
[1:25:32] the consequences of your
[1:25:35] language consider the consequences of
[1:25:38] giving your life to Christ and not
[1:25:39] sticking with it consider the
[1:25:42] consequences of putting God second or
[1:25:45] third or fourth or
[1:25:47] last in your
[1:25:50] life are you really too busy are you
[1:25:52] really too busy really are you too busy
[1:25:55] to come to
[1:25:56] church are you too busy to
[1:25:58] pray are you too busy to study your
[1:26:01] Bible is getting your way what is really
[1:26:05] important to
[1:26:06] you or is it following Christ's leading
[1:26:11] attending church tithing lending a
[1:26:15] helping hand taking somebody out out to
[1:26:17] lunch who just needs a shoulder to cry
[1:26:18] on and listening to them a
[1:26:21] ear just lending your ear here to
[1:26:26] someone means so much I know brothers
[1:26:29] and sisters I I counsel people I know a
[1:26:31] lot of times people just they need to
[1:26:33] get it out they need somebody who really
[1:26:37] cares but are you too busy for
[1:26:40] that you're too
[1:26:44] busy to do anything that doesn't serve
[1:26:47] yourself that's the world and I say that
[1:26:49] a lot but that's the way the world
[1:26:50] teaches
[1:26:52] today Jesus says so likewise
[1:26:55] whosoever he be of you that forsakes not
[1:26:59] all that he
[1:27:00] hath he cannot be my
[1:27:03] disciple Jesus requires
[1:27:07] everything go
[1:27:08] [Music]
[1:27:11] back he
[1:27:13] said you might ask what do I need to
[1:27:16] do what do I need to do brother you you
[1:27:19] you talk about this but you never tell
[1:27:22] me what exactly I need need to
[1:27:25] do Peter at the day of Pentecost he gave
[1:27:29] an executive order from God when they
[1:27:32] asked him the same thing he said
[1:27:36] repent he said go back from your sins
[1:27:40] May there be something inside of you
[1:27:42] that you know that you are a sinner that
[1:27:45] you know you've done something wrong go
[1:27:49] back
[1:27:51] repent and then be bap AP ized in the
[1:27:55] name of Jesus
[1:27:56] Christ for the remission of your sins
[1:28:00] for take the taking away of your
[1:28:03] [Music]
[1:28:04] sins the executive Authority from God
[1:28:09] was death Hell In The Grave for every
[1:28:11] one of us and here is Jesus and he says
[1:28:15] she's Justified with what she did she's
[1:28:18] justified in her lies she's justified in
[1:28:21] her immorality he is Justified in all of
[1:28:23] his sin sins because I take the
[1:28:25] punishment for
[1:28:27] it and that's no longer and then we say
[1:28:31] Lord I lay my sins on
[1:28:33] you you took you took the authority
[1:28:36] there this came from the father it came
[1:28:38] down to me you wiped it away and now
[1:28:42] Lord what I want I don't want it to be
[1:28:44] no I don't want it to be me any longer I
[1:28:46] read that scripture in galations I have
[1:28:49] been crucified with Christ now I'm
[1:28:51] taking out my cross now I am following
[1:28:53] Jesus Jesus a cross is a shameful burden
[1:28:57] that we have to
[1:28:59] bear I'm taking up my cross I've been
[1:29:01] crucified with
[1:29:02] Christ then Galatians 2:20 says it is no
[1:29:06] longer I who
[1:29:08] live but Christ lives in me and the life
[1:29:12] which I now live in the flesh I live by
[1:29:14] faith in the Son of God who loved
[1:29:18] me and gave himself for me I do not set
[1:29:23] aside the Great of God for if
[1:29:26] righteousness comes through the law then
[1:29:28] Christ died in vain once again and no
[1:29:32] longer I who live but Christ in me and
[1:29:36] the life which I now live in the flesh I

[1:34:56] amen the song written after that
[1:34:59] scripture in Galatians how beautiful he
[1:35:02] did he brought us back to life I was
[1:35:05] dead in my sins I was dead in my
[1:35:08] trespasses I was living a life that was
[1:35:11] meaningless but God brought me back and
[1:35:14] he brought me back to life did he bring
[1:35:17] you back to life brothers and sisters it
[1:35:18] means so
[1:35:20] much it's a simple simple story
[1:35:25] brother Braham said one time Christ
[1:35:28] preached the whole sermon on it Christ
[1:35:30] is the mystery of God
[1:35:33] revealed all the mysteries of God they
[1:35:37] are represented in Jesus
[1:35:39] Christ and if we can just know him if we
[1:35:42] can just understand him if we can just
[1:35:45] understand what he did in our lives
[1:35:47] that's the most important thing it's not
[1:35:50] all of this
[1:35:51] stuff we love all of we we love all of
[1:35:54] the Bible we love all of the word but
[1:35:56] it's all based on this it's all based on
[1:35:59] Jesus Christ and him
[1:36:01] alone and if we can Tru truly understand
[1:36:04] that and truly understand what he did
[1:36:06] for
[1:36:07] us the simple analogy of an executive
[1:36:10] order coming down and your boss taking
[1:36:13] the blame for
[1:36:15] you Jesus Took the ultimate blame for
[1:36:19] us so your sins in your life
[1:36:23] the things that you have done
[1:36:26] wrong that man 33 years old he answered
[1:36:31] for
[1:36:32] us Brother Juan there's nobody
[1:36:35] else there's no other mediator between
[1:36:38] God and
[1:36:39] man only the man Christ
[1:36:42] Jesus he is right
[1:36:44] there between the law and
[1:36:50] me if it's the if it's the letter of the
[1:36:52] law I am condemned to
[1:36:54] hell but I'm not condemned to
[1:36:57] Hell by his
[1:37:00] merits I am saved by the blood of Jesus
[1:37:05] Christ are you a Christian brothers and
[1:37:08] sisters are you Christians brother James
