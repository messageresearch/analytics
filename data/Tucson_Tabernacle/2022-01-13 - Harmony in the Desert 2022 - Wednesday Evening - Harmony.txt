TRANSCRIPT
========================================
to me is so wonderful [Music] is one more time tell them oh how i love jesus oh [Applause] brother vic bernal brother vic comes up to open in prayer welcome this evening god bless each one of you good to have you with us tonight so amen [Music] before we go to prayer if it'd be appropriate i'd like to read something psalms 133 was up here earlier behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity how many wants more unity we need it church i'd like to share with you something brother brown said on thirsting for life he said how did this great pillar of fire the angel of god the logos that went out of god that led the children of israel through the wilderness when he come among the people listen when he come among the people it separated itself and great licks of fire began to come upon each one as the pillar of fire began to break up and to god dividing himself among his people oh that ought to tear the heart out of everybody god tearing himself apart that he might divide himself a little bit with each one of us that all together you see what it means can you see now why i'm standing for unity of every church every full gospel church every believer we ought to be in one heart one mind and one accord no matter how much different we no matter how much we different in the scriptures that might be oh might see this that way one might see it this way or that has nothing to do with it but in principle we ought to stand one great mighty army of god marching on because each one of you in your peculiarity god has proved that he's ignoring ignoring your doctrine because he gave you the holy ghost and the bible said he gave them the holy ghost that obeyed him listen to this last verse now if i obeyed him in my peculiar way and you obedient obeyed him in your peculiar way he give us both the holy ghost so we ought to be christian brethren and sisters enough to arm up together and march on for one great purpose the gospel let's bow our hands heavenly father we want to thank you for the privilege that we have together together one with another into this sanctuary here this evening lord it's always good to gather together in church like this and father our expectations is high tonight as we gather around the words you've left in this generation father how thankful we are that you stepped into this generation you pulled one up and you talked through him you teach your children lord by that message that you've given us and we want to thank you for that we thank you for the word lord that steel is preserved we love you with everything that's inside of us and father we are a peculiar people but father those that have the holy spirit in their life they are peculiar they do peculiar things father i pray that you would cap capture our hearts tonight as we hear this message you talk to each one as only you can jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever father may we realize who's talking to us tonight and may we gather up real close to you and feel the very hear the very heartbeat of god through the word that we're going to hear we thank you father for your grace your mercy and your love and father the greatest thing that i seen in the prophet's life was the love that he had for the people father may we be challenged every time that we put on a tape may we be challenged to have that kind of love because i believe that it's that perfect love that will take us home be with us now lord everything that's said and done throughout the courses of the next few days and we want to tell you one more time lord we love you thank you father for loving us in jesus name amen i had asked brother jordan to put that scripture up without knowing that was a real scripture he was going to read so i

of a wide-ranging river trusting that i'd get across i've made my way through some valleys and deserts believing i'd never get lost i've stood out the front of what felt like mount everest knowing i'd have the strength for the climb it's through every trial each test and temptation there's one thing that's sure every time over and over again and again god is faithful over and over again and again through it all he's made me able to stand and survive to come through alive when it sure looked like i couldn't win but jesus is with me so i'll claim the victory over and over again if you ask me why i have no hesitation god does what he says he will do i'd simply say every battle has taught me there's nothing he won't bring me through so why should i dwell on the heartaches and struggles when i look just beyond them i see the way this will end is in great celebration and deep in my heart i believe over and over again and again god is faithful [Music] over and over again and again through it all he's made me a to stand and survive to come through alive when it sure looked like i couldn't win but jesus is with me so i'll claim the victory over and over again over and over again and again our god is faithful over and over again and again through it all he's made us able to stand and survive to come through alive [Music] but jesus is with us so we'll claim the victory over and over again [Music] our god is faithful about nine years ago around this time sarah called mom up said can you take me to the doctor i just don't feel good thought maybe she had a cold or something and they started checking her out around two o'clock in the afternoon they told us she has congestive heart failure her kidneys quit working they didn't give her much hope fed one doctor told her you've got about two weeks to live that was nine years ago our god is faithful amen appreciate it from the littlest thing what what we would call little maybe to the greatest thing he's the same yesterday today in forever amen so just uh brother jordan do you have that uh picture we a brother sent this to us hopefully he'll get to post that the advertisement brother brown was going to speak for the first time in tucson right in this church it was an assembly that god church at the time and her brother found him he sent it to us so they were advertising and he spoke two services the sunday morning and sunday evening this is the sermon we'll hear tonight he stood right behind this physical pulpit brother greene managed to save it and get it and we've used it since but it was the first time brother branham was here and so it was an advertisement that they said and i wish they would still do things like that go to church on sunday but it's not very popular anymore so brother branham was ministering he's preached expectation on sunday morning in jesus christ same yesterday today and forever sunday evening here and there was a group of spanish brothers here in tucson who were had just been hearing the message and trying to find and of course tucson tabernacle hadn't started yet and there were some folks here and they heard brother branham was going to be here and they found out the evening so they got here but they got laid and the only open area was that little space right there so they set up a bunch of chairs and the spanish brothers got to sit there that would have been the figueroa family the sotelo family four or five spanish families whose children and grandchildren sons and daughters are still serving the lord today and here's something brother tony stromer was a good friend of brother abraham's here in tucson one of his hunting buddies and all and yeah brother branham told uh brother tony he said the angel of the lord pointed to that group of brothers and said this message is for them and it's been this he it's been true they have stood and because of them we heard the message you know god allows that to be and i appreciate i appreciate the goodness of the lord to us so so in in this this uh message tonight you'll hear right in the beginning brother branham prays a simple prayer over this church and he said may this church stay open this little church till jesus comes may it send out missionaries and and you'll hear the description and i say it's going to stay open till jesus comes and let us be a light let us be a shining light till then so we want to get started on the tape here as as quick as we can it is two hours long so i want to do that but there was a song down from his glory dedicated to brother branham before and brother branham speaks about it so this evening brother mental friesian is going to come up and he's going to sing that for us if he'll come on up and do that now we'd appreciate that because jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever i love you and all great honor to stand in this church years and of course we what the prophet said god given himself purpose that he might live in a body the mystical body to the glory of god will sing this down from his glory [Music] down from his glory ever-living story my god and savior came and jesus is his name born into a manger [Music] yet to his own a stranger [Music] a man of sorrow fear and a good name [Music] oh how i love him how i adore him my breath my sunshine my all and all [Music] the great creator became my savior [Music] and all god's fullness dwelleth in him without reluctance flesh and blood his substance [Music] he took the form of man and revealed his head in plan oh glorious mistery sacrifice of calvary and now i know he is the great i am oh how i love him how i adore him my breath my sunshine my all and all the great create became my savior and all god's fullness [Music] oh [Music] [Music] the great creature [Music] god [Music] brother branham called that the most god-honoring song he had heard he became me so that i might become him let's sing that song he became me so that i might become my grace he became me so that i might become him my brain [Music] he took my place [Music] my oh he became me so that i might become him my grace he became me so that i might become him he took my place [Music] [Music] hard to imagine him as a little baby crying for his mama but in order to be touched by the feeling of our infirmities he went through it all so when i say i heard when a little child calls on him he understands what a mighty god we sure amen so this evening the message jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever preaching 61 here right in this very building only believe only belief are things still possible without brother branham being here is it is he still possible is because jesus christ is the same yesterday oh maybe [Music] are possible [Music] all things are possible [Music] now tell him you believe [Music] lord i believe lord i believe all things are possible lord [Music] lord i believe [Music] all things are possible lord i will be when jesus spoke to that man there at the altar and he said do you believe he says yes lord i believe but help thou my unbelief sometimes you get to looking at yourself and you wonder look to him he's the same yesterday today emperor you may be seated as they begin the tape tonight like i said it's about two hours long so worship the lord and listen to what god has for us today i was so thrilled when i heard that song down from his glory ever who that brother was that's saying that i heard he was dedicated to me i sure appreciate that that's my favorite hymn wrote by a personal friend of mine uh brother william booth cliven it expresses in there the deity of our lord jesus christ today when they try to make him just another man or or a prophet or something i think that expresses what he was he came down from glory god was manifested in the flesh in christ jesus his son he expressed in his flesh what god was and god can express to us what he is if we'll just let him through the righteousness of christ then our unrighteousness is not counted to us it is reckon our faith is reckoned that it will be counted to us as faith and righteousness in his sight which we have none of our own that we could offer i just trust that it will be a great time again that i can come back to to this city this morning i was speaking in such a lovely little audience here of such a responding audience i feel if we could stay with you a little while so we get to know each other my ministry is a little odd and therefore not being able to express it all at one little service then it makes you wonder about this or that but when we are for a quite a while visiting you can see night after night and watch what's spoken see if it happens and that then you begin to realize and what it the ministry is and that it makes us uh understand one another much better i certainly appreciate the invitation that a pastor here gave me to come here to the church for all you people and for all the churches throughout the city i hope someday it could be the will of god that i could come back and stay a more extended service in the city where we could get all the peoples together the churches the ministers and tonight it's pretty rough on the ministers maybe man there's sick people had to get permission to come down to be prayed for and i wish i could express my feelings to the pastors that turn their congregation out tonight that they could come to hear the service and to be prayed for may the lord ever bless man like that man of of great of great integrity someone who's got a real heart for sick and needy people i'm sure that they will prosper in doing things like that now i think there's several churches here i just had a letter open a few moments ago from the pastor of the first assembly of god here in the city and he had someone real sick here in the hospital and and if i don't know he's in church at this time i suppose and i certainly will be in prayer for that person if any of their people are here christ is the same yesterday today and forever he never can fail and i trust that he'll bless each of us tonight and we'll leave here with the glory of god in our hearts now i would like to say this because of just passing through and praying for the sick and saying a healing service now we that's not all my ministry we believe the first thing is salvation because if you get healed you'll live any time you'll probably be sick again but when you receive christ you've got eternal life and how much more uh is eternal life and just the healing of the body but divine healing christ used it and divine healing to attract the attention of the people and about 86 percent of his ministry was in divine healing therefore it's something that shows the supernatural now all that could ever be done for a person for you i or anyone was completed and finished at calvary now when i many i've heard many say if they had healing in their hands and that that may be all true i don't know but the way i believe it is that our healing is completed with our salvation he was wounded for our transgressions and with his stripes we were healed it's a past tense now the only way that we can receive anything from god is i catch this is not to look for something uh say my hands crippled i was prayed for my hands doesn't straighten out a moment that doesn't mean i'm not healed no that doesn't do i have one thing to do with it see because i've noticed in 31 years in the ministry 15 years or round around the world that sometimes you pray for a person it'd be a week or two before it ever happens and i was thinking of a case just now i've often referred to it a lady came into the meeting and it was in the prayer line and the holy spirit began to tell her about who she was and what was wrong she had a tremendous ulcer in her stomach and and then it told her that that's what the holy spirit's saying she knows there'd be something to reveal that she recognized it and she wanted to act upon it and then down the line a little farther was her neighbor and her neighbor had a growth on her neck and she was prayed for and the holy spirit had pronounced her heel well when she went home she said well perhaps i'll just go ahead and eat now i'm all right so she started to eat and made a real sick and three or four weeks passed and still she would try to have faith to move on and her husband told her said honey i don't mind you having faith like that but said you're just bringing reproach upon the very cause of christ how little that husband know she can't do that as long as she's confessing his word or he is the high priest of our confession he cannot do one thing for us the first we confess you people have been saved you know this you can come there at the altar and cry and lay on the altar and confess and all you want to and cry and pray and beat on the altar for year after year and you'll never be saved until you accept his pardon see if something you accept it's yours it belongs to you healing is yours you've got to accept it and until you accept it the book of hebrews says he's the high priest of our confession or profession both translate the thing when we confess it he's the high priest to make intercessions on what we confess and we confess his finished work at calvary this woman was doing that one morning she was washing her dishes and all at once said she was thinking about the meeting and her husband told her a night before it said honey i believe you better stay strictly to your diet and so forth and stop saying about being healed said he may heal you sometimes she said hubby if that man could tell me what the things of my life that i have done and he was correct and he told me thus saith the lord i'm healed i'll believe it until i die that's the way that if he forced all what i was had done surely he can tell me what i would do and her husband went to work and she was washing she said the dishes and she felt a real cool feeling strike in her she wondered what's that she got real hungry now after getting hungry she thought i just got to eat a piece of toast she'd taken a little toast and eat it and we usually started vomiting the duodenal officer and vomit but it it didn't vomit then some of the children had left in her place behind mother of bee from their children some oatmeal and that just burned her up when she eat that oatmeal and then the starches and so when she taken a few spoonfuls of that didn't bother her so then she eat the rest of the dish of the oatmeal didn't bother but she fried her up some bacon and eggs and had a gastronomical jubilee and drank her a big cup of coffee and she just had a great time and that's why she waited a couple hours and everything is all right she just feeling so fine she's running around screaming she ran down the street to tell her neighbor and when she got down there it's around 9 30 at 10 o'clock her neighbor was standing the floor screaming and she thought somebody died in there so she ran in and they both threw their arms around one another and her neighbor had a sheet in her hand so what's the other sheet said i'm trying to find that thing it left my throat just a while ago before i got up he said that place went off on my throat and they drove i guess about 300 miles to catch up at the meeting or more to to tell the experience that's one of thousands what was it the very angel of the lord that knows what has been and predicts what will be he can't always come to your rescue in a second the clergy knows that daniel prayed in 21 days before the angel could get to him but it passed through the neighborhood confirming the word and they were well that's the way it is we must remember that healing is a finished work at calvary and the only thing that anyone can do now a minister that's taught in the word he can stand up and preach the word to you now if he preaches the word faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of god that's the original but then god is the good god is our good friend brother oral roberts expresses he is a good god and then yet if we don't take his word part then besides that if we don't take his word he's got another way he'll send he's got gifts in the church there's nine spiritual gifts set into the local each local body should be in full operation in everybody every church and in that is a gifts of tongues and interpretation of tongues and now that just isn't repeating us something or making a vain repetition is saying something directly to be interpreted for a certain person in that congregation or something that make way tongues by interpretation is prophecy and it's prophetic utterance given to the people to to tell them what to do or something to correct them or if the great church of the living god would always be set in order i find it then besides that he's got five ministerial offices first is apostles or missionaries the word apostle means one cent a missionary means one saint secondarily prophets evangelists pastors and so forth those are god-given gifts that set into the church they're predestinated of god and set to the church you can't make yourself a minister you god's got to call you to be a minister prophets are for ordained their prophets now he's a gift of prophecy in the church that could be on one then the next one the next one the next one so forth a prophecy paul said you may all prophesy one by one but there's a lot of difference between a prophet and a prophecy prophecy has to be judged by three witnesses two or three before it can be given are accepted in the church according to the scriptures but a prophet like the old testament prophet they had the word of the law the translation was right to them and they were known because the bible said if there be one among you spiritually or a prophet i the lord will make myself known to him speak to him in visions and reveal myself in dreams and if what this man says comes to pass then hear him before i'm with him if it doesn't then don't hear him i'm not with him don't fear him now you see therefore that divine healing is something that christ did for us now we must have faith now i find two classes of people in my travel one of them is fundamental the other one is pentecostal now the fundamental positionally knows what they are but they don't go deep enough they know positionally if they are sons of god but they don't go deep enough like uh thought about our precious brother billy graham when he was in our city i met him several times without his ministerial breakfast he said paul went into a city and preached the gospel and one man was converted he went back a year later said he had 30 converts to met one but i'll go into steady and stay six weeks and have 20 000. come back in another six months and i can't find 20. he said what's the matter you lazy preacher she said set with your feet up on the desk instead of going out and visiting now the evangelist had something here but he didn't have all of it who was the one taking that one for paul paul took him deep enough in christ until he was filled with the holy ghost and it's burning so he'd set the whole town of power but when you just ask them to stand except christ the savior set back down they haven't went deep enough to know what to do you must take them on into the baptism of the spirit therefore i find fundamental people they positionally know what they are but they have no faith then i find the pentecostal people that has a lot of faith but don't know who they are it's just like a man one man's got money in the bank but can't write a check the other can write a check and has no money to bank if you could ever get those together the gospel will pay off great that's right get some fundamental teachings in a pentecostal church or pentecostal faith and fundamental meetings then you've got to know positionally first christ where you stand you are heir to this it's your personal property it belongs to you it's god's gift to you nobody can take it away from you it's yours what you ask the father in my name that i'll do who can deny anything there verily verily i say unto you if you stay this mountain be moved don't doubt your heart but believe that what you've said shall come to pass you can have whatever you said what promises not limited just the healing but the whatsoever now you've got to find your objective and your emotive and then the will of god if it is the will of god and your motives right and your objective is right then the mountain will fall but outside of that you could scream till you got hoarse and died and there would move i think your first thing it's got to be the will of god the next thing it's your objective and going into it and then the motive you have you want to be some big person is one thing that jesus christ lacked when he was on earth that was showmanship he wasn't a showman you couldn't let's say him to be a stuffed shirt he kept away humble he kept his meeting so he could go wherever the father led him to go and one of his brothers said if you can do these things why don't you come up to campus to get amongst the big classics and the rabbis and do it so everybody can see you what you doing hanging out with a bunch of holy rollers or no i mean that like that i mean fishermen and so important i was just thinking about what one of the brothers of the church that i just come from well that's it you see but christ wasn't a showmanship he said your times always that is right he came to his own and his own received him not that's the most pathetic thing i know of in the scriptures he came to his own and his own receiving not now as we approach the word tonight i want you to bear that in mind that we a person that remember that god doesn't have stuffed out shirts when you get to a place that you're willing to be nothing then god can make something out of you but as long as you're trying to be big and a lot of flowerly advertising and all this stuff and going on my opinion something's happened see jesus went along doing good going to the poor and needy he never made himself any a reputation did you ever think of that he made of himself no reputation the man that made an artificial tooth made a reputation for himself but the one that made the real tooth made of himself no repetition the man that made an artificial arm made a reputation for himself but the man who made the real arm made of himself no reputation the way up is down always remember that be humble be sweet and kind be creative let christ being you do you ever see people you love to be around just love to be around them because they create an atmosphere heavenly and you like to be around others seem to be good people but yeah i have to get away once in a while that you know what i mean and yet they seem to be good people it's not creative and man was made to be a god we know that genesis 1 26 he had domain over the whole earth and he was made to be an amateur god and now when he receives god he becomes the son of god again he is made in the image of god god had hands god had feet and so therefore a man was made like him so he is an amateur god but sin has blinded every fiber in his body in his mind in his heart but now don't never try to study it out you cannot figure it out in the garden of eden satan chose his part of the man his head his intellectuals god took his heart the intellectuals will reason why well i'm i'm this way and i'm that way you'll never get anywhere with god there but your heart your faith will make you believe things that your mind knows nothing about it casts down reasons you must be positive and you stay there until you are positive man when you're positive nothing can turn you now let us bow our heads just a moment before we approach the the author of this word as we read it i wonder tonight with our heads bowed and our eyes closed is there any here that would like to be remembered in prayer and let it be known by your uplifted hand you'd say lord i need thee i need thee for my health i need you for my soul god bless you god bless you that's good father lead me i need thy guiding spirit our heavenly father as we come approaching again in the name of the lord jesus you said that we would ask abundantly that our joys would be full now we're coming to ask of our mercy first for our own sins the things that we have thought and did that was contrary to your leading we pray that you forgive us as we stand here in this holy sanctuary for the holy spirit present know how i have often wondered how i would feel if i could hold in a glass just two drops of his literal blood how i would draw it up to my bosom and weep because i know it was that blood that saved me but tonight thou has given me a greater than that the very purchase of his blood to speak to boy he loved the world so much that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever breathes on him should not perish but have eternal life now he thought more obvious people than he did of his own blood so he gave his blood to purchase this church your i'm standing tonight to teach the ways of life to this church oh merciful father there's no one worthy to do that we pray lord that you forgive us and if you were looking for someone worthy where would you find them we have none we're all unclean father but be merciful to us because of your promise that you said you would do it you said i am the vine ye are the branches and if we abide in you that we can ask what we will and it'll be given to us he said the works that i do shall you also even greater than these for i go to my father now that your word might be fulfilled tonight lord i pray that you'll manifest your presence among us in an extraordinary way i pray for those who raise their hands father god be merciful now also offer a prayer again for the little blind little girl standing in the hall tonight wanted to return to her people to be a missionary oh god may that child receive its sight i pray for that precious brother there in a hospital belongs to the first assembly of god you're in town he's dying oh god stay the hand of death as this church this body calls out for mercy hear great prayer answering god and father we'd ask for each of us here ask for our little pastor brother and for these other ministers evangelists and and your servants is on the platform inspire them lord and give their ministry a great charge of your holy spirit may this little house here we're in tonight be open until jesus come if he tarries may missionaries and ministers be sent from here to all over the world may it truly be the house for the side of the road where the weary can come in and find rest save the lost heal the sick sanctify the believers and give us faith tonight father oh god that's what we need faith in our word we asked it in jesus name amen in saint john 12 20. and there were certain greeks among them that came up to the feast to worship the same came to philip which was a bethesda of galilee and desired him saying sir we would see jesus and my text is found in hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever now just not to hold you but to get your attention for a few moments to build a faith around or each one of you to be healed as i look in the church tonight see a man here coughing a darling linger some mothers precious babies a big water head dying dear old woman sitting in a wheelchair and so forth oh if there was some way something that i could do and maybe these in a wheelchair and so forth would live an ordinary life and maybe a good healthy looking man or woman sitting out or a young person will be dead by tomorrow in a heart attack i mean these may outlive him a long time we don't know see the white canes the people walking blind or if there's just something i can do to help you if i didn't think i could help you i would never come by here if i didn't think i could help the people it isn't for money that i don't take and uh i'm 51 years old i've been preaching for 31 years and never took offering all my life so i i do not we keep money out of it we keep our meetings small so we don't have to have big programs and things to operate so we can go to the smallest of church or wherever the lord leads that's where we go now i'm not condemning the brethren who has those big programs and television tests and so forth that's fine i thank god that there's man in the world that he can trust with money like that that can that but for me i i just couldn't do it i'd have to take up money and i i've never done it yet and i pray god will help me i never have to so i'm here to help you and if i didn't think i could help you i sure wouldn't be here i'd be home tonight with my wife little boy and two little girls i'd be sitting up there for the fire somewhere tonight in the east enjoying with them but i'm almost a stranger to them i just see them now and then traveling the world around but there was a question asked here in the scripture and uh this morning i left off speaking on the word of expectation to expect now i trust that you talk at home with you and search through the scriptures to find out what to expect god's word tells us what we can expect and if we receive this word without any doubt mixed into it we will receive what we come for but if you go away say well uh just as i expected i well you won't see a thing but if you come expecting to see the lord jesus manifest itself amongst the people you'll go away satisfied you certainly will you'll know that something happened but if you say well i just as i expected just another oh an evangelist stand up speaking and and uh that that's what's all you'll get you usually get what you're looking for so open up your heart tonight and take down the umbrella and just no just receive it god in your heart and go away go back to your churches wherever you're from and tell your pastor that truly the lord jesus is the great healer and he's the one who saves and fills the believer with his spirit and makes him a new creatures in christ the pastor said how you know that's uh i'm experienced i know a brother not long ago that disagrees upon christ being the healer he makes me some historical god he said oh i don't believe anything would happen said i still don't believe in divine healing i said certainly not it wasn't for you it wasn't for unbelievers it was for those who believe it's just meant for belief that's he didn't he didn't purchase our healing for unbelievers he purchased for them that believe the promise is not the unbelievers but to them that believe so these greeks come up to the feast now the greeks was learned people and they came up to this feast of pentecost to to worship and while they were at the temple they had heard about the lord jesus and somehow another i don't believe that there is anybody who can ever hear that lovely name called whatever but what would desire to see our new year of jesus there's something about that name of the lord jesus that it inspires and you can never feel the same it's a name above all name he came down from heaven and the world gave him the lowest name there was on the earth beelzebub a fortune teller a devil and he went to the lowest city there is in the earth jericho and was sold to the smallest man the city had to look down on him to see exactly but when he paid the price of redemption god gave him a name above every name even all the family in heaven and earth is named jesus and exalted his throne so high till he has to look down to see heaven that's the difference so way the world treated him the way the father treated him when he come up now so these greeks were a cureth and then heard about him heard of his great work so to perhaps curiosity or maybe for sincere benefits they came and said sirs we would see jesus and i believe if i could interpret the mind of this church tonight these people that's the desire of our heart how many here would like to see jesus sure well i'm going to ask you a question did they did they get to see him yes sir philip tuck them to see him tell them to other brothers and they take them to see jesus so if they inquired and desired to see jesus they were given the privilege of seeing him by one of his servants now if hebrews 13 8 is correctly inspired scripture that said jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever then if that's our desire then why can't we seed now remember this word is either the truth art isn't the truth there's no contradiction in it i've offered anyone oh i get a hundred dollars a week and i i'll offer anyone your salary you can show me a contradiction the word don't straighten itself out with it's not there it's hidden from the eyes the wise and fruity and revealed to babe such as we'll learn jesus thanked the father for doing that the word's not mixed up it's the people mixed up it's not the word so the holy spirit wrote the word it takes the holy spirit to interpret the word it'll all work just exactly right now if jesus christ is the same yesterday and forever and god forgive me for saying if because it sounds sacrilegious he is the same yesterday day and forever all right then if you desire to see him then why can't you see him we are his servants so why can't you see him would you love to do it love to see him all right i believe that he made this promise that whatever two or three are gathered in my name there i'll be in their midst now is that true now if that isn't true then the bible isn't true and your salvation isn't true and we're lost and miserable of all people we're the miserables because we got a a bogus thing we're thinking of a christ that's a coming and a heaven to go to and there is no such well if this word's wrong then that word is him and then all's wrong but if it's right then every one of it's right it isn't some for one time sum for another it's all the time the same where he can find believers now if jesus will come into this audience tonight miserable now he could not come in a corporal body because that's that's on the throne of god but he can come in here by the holy spirit and show you himself being here working in his church you believe that he has to be there everything in the same principle you have to have the same love the same compassion same word same manifestation if he is the same yesterday today and forever now remember jesus when the works was being done jesus did not heal anyone he said i cannot heal no one he said it's not me that doeth the works it's my father and he dwelleth in me that right he dwelleth in me and a little while when he went away he said and the world will see me no more yet ye shall see me for ah i is a personal pronoun i will be with you even in you to the end of the consummation to the world comes to the end ah and the works that i do shall you do also if you abide me in my works than you ask what you will and it shall be given all those great promises how they trill my soul in the day when atomic missiles russians got sputniks in the air and all these well there's no rest nowhere only in christ there's not one thing our nation we cannot build our hopes upon because any little nation can throw a bomb over here and blow us off the earth warfare is about over you just need one man to pull a lever at all go to pieces and we see you can't build your hopes on nothing else but one thing not quote eddie pruitt here when he said all hail the power of jesus name let angels prostrate fall bring forth the royal diadem a crime lord of all for on christ the solid rock i stand all other grounds of sinking sands all other grounds of sinking sand our only hope they're trying to build a hole down the ground crawl into it they got a bomb that'll blow up a hole in the ground 500 foot deep and for almost 100 miles square well if you were 10 000 feet below the earth it break every bone in your body the concussion of it but there is a shelter oh it's not made out of steel but it's made out of feathers under his wings i like that shelter sweetly peacefully abide knowing this that as soon as before that bomb even gets a whistle to start on his wings he'll bear us up oh that's what i'm looking for that great rapture and approach of our lord jesus and to see it coming so close our hearts just jump for joy to know that it's a joy someone said brother branham said you scare the people by telling them the lord jesus is coming the end of the world i told my not christians oh paul said i have fought a good fight i've finished the course i've kept the faith and henceforth there is there for me a crown of righteousness that the lord the righteous judge will give me at that day and not only to me but all those who love his appearing what greater thing could happen and jesus come right now apparently our trials will be over we just keep holding on until he gets here working conserving the time and making every minute count for him wherever we are speak a little word for him now if he's been so real to us and we have ceni's mercy and seen what he wants now and we are under expectations tonight of seeing him then why can't we see him i'll tell you he's everywhere if you just look around the trouble of it is that people don't look around enough to find him we live on the ohio river and oh it's a great place for fishing there's a little boy in our city that used to play down the river with an old fisherman and he uh asked his mother one day they belonged to a great church in the city he said mommy god is such a great person could anybody see him she said i can't answer you that son said you asked your sunday school teacher and he asked the sunday school teacher and she said i don't know you asked the pastor so he asked the pastor and the pastor said no sonny no man can see god and live said you just can't see it didn't satisfy the little land he went down on the river and this old fisherman it was a deacon in my church so he he was up the river one day at the six mile island fishing and on the road down coming back down the river they come up a storm and they had to bank their little craft for a few moments the storm blowed over in indiana and around the eastern countries where the hardwoods that rain falls and washes off all the leaves and that little breeze blows just when an oramon can only tell the tip of the oars and tips those waves the music it makes on the water oh no wonder the spirit of god moved on the water first to see how that at going down this old fisherman great old spirit-filled brother pulling these oars like this and lifted his oars tip on the water is looking back heading he was going west and looking east and there's a rainbow came out the old man his companion had been gone years he's watching that rainbow and over his silver beard there come little trickles of tears running off his beard the little boy was sitting in the stern of the boat got so enthused he ran up to the center of the boat and he said fell down at his lip limbs and said sir i'm going to ask you a question to my mother's sunday school teacher neither pastor can satisfy me he said can anyone see god and it overcome the old fisherman he pulled the oars in the boat braced the little lad in his arms and he stroked his little hair and said god bless your little heart sonny all i've seen for the past 50 years has been god so much on the inside he could see him out say the rainbow wherever it is that's what it is if you're looking at him from an intellectual standpoint she'll never know him you've got to look through him let him come into you and show his self what he is we can see god if we'll just look around and i'm afraid some of us might look too late there's a lady in a 10-cent store in louisville across the river from us a few months ago she had a little boy a little bitty lad about three years old and the people noticed she go around pick up things and try to show him off the 10 cent door counters and he just stared a little lad so she come to another counter she began to get hysterically and she picked up something else like a little boy that age ought to notice and rang the little bell on the little trinket said look honey look honey the little boy just sat staring she was exhausted and she just fell over the counter screaming oh no no it isn't so and this bystanders rushed to the lady to see what had happened she said my little boy a few months ago just started staring right in his face nothing that off to attract him attracts his attention and said i took him to the doctor and the doctor said he was better but said he isn't that he just sets and stares he won't look at things that he ought to look at for a little boy of his age and how true that is with the church today we've had great men across this country like old roberts and great gifts has come into the church and they the church just sat in stairs the baptism of the holy spirit struck the nation and many churches have been filled with the spirit and great revivals has taken place and the world just sets and stares in space when god does anything he expects people to look at it and believing miracles and signs and wonders that god does is a little something you're shaking before the church to wake up the church that is soon coming my son and i recently we visit india and i read a piece in the paper that we got uh on the plane and said i guess the earthquake is over a few days before the earthquake come in india they just pick up the rocks and make fences and walls and so forth they don't have the woven wire and the stuff that we have here they're very poor people 470 million there and about look at me a million beggars and very pathetic sight some of the minister brother and if you ever see them sites you you can never feel satisfied here no more there's something them thousands of screaming and crying to hear the story of jesus in here you have to almost persuade people to come to church but they're they're hungering there for god and the paper went on to read that all the little birds that makes her nest up in the crevices of the rocks and things flew away out into the field and sat in the trees and all the sheep and cattle stood around the big wall went out into the field and leaned against each other for about a day and all at once our coming earthquake and shut the walls down and then for a day the little birds stayed away and the cattle stayed in the field finally they began to come back around the shade again what part of the walls was left what was it the same god that could call them into the ark could call them away from them walls that lost your lives that they'd stayed around there and surely if the holy spirit can still have inspiration and by instinct direct an animal away from danger and a bird how much more ought to do to his children born of the spirit of god to get away from the things that's not godly stay away from it come out lean on each other oh i love that old story the song we're leaning on the everlasting arm i like that just trust him simplicity of the trust just lean your shoulders against his and adore him with all the adoration that you can pour out and walk with him daily now you'll see now the only way i perhaps tonight we got methodist baptists and and this the coast into mexico we probably got many mexican catholic and so forth all mixed together now that's the way it's supposed to be god loves all of his children they're mixed in all organization loving god trusting christ for their salvation then if i'd say to the catholic would you see jesus well let's say our church represents him i'd say to the baptist the would you see jesus uh our church is the one who shows him the methodist the pentecostal and different ones would all have a different idea of it i think tonight to bring it down to a simple thing that the best way to find out what he is is to go back and find out what he was well he was yesterday if he's the same yesterday today and forever what he was he must be the same thing today would that be sufficient for all churches then you can you can suit that to yourself whether your church teaches it this way or not find out what he was and if he is the same yesterday and forever what he was he must be the same today uh let's go back i'm reading out of saint john the first chapter of saint john and we'll go back and see what he was now you can take it and approach it from any word in the scriptures we can hold a two weeks meeting and just on what he was or two weeks two centuries and never get out what he was but just to get a few highlights of what he was then if he'll be the same today right here as he was then that makes him the same that ought to settle the question y'all believe it that's good now we found out we was born to the virgin birth we had that this morning and then we found out immediately the holy spirit came upon him he was led into the wilderness and was tempted of the devil for 40 days and came out preaching the gospel now we find the first of his ministry he started praying for the sick the sick people being healed and we noticed that his congregation come from the the poor people the the outcasts the ones that were probably cast away didn't have much education like the man he gave the keys to the kingdom peter couldn't even sign his own name the bible said he was ignorant and unlearned but by his faith it pleased jesus to give him the keys to the kingdom because he had the revelation of him who does man say are the son of man out one said our of the elijah and one said you're the prophet and you're so and so he said but who do you say he said the art the christ the son of the living god now the catholic says that he build his church upon peter if he did he backslid right away then if the protestant said he built it up on himself are different from that it wasn't upon himself either up on peter but upon the revelation i say unto thee the heart simon all right peter flesh and blood does not reveal this to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed and upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell cannot prevail against it amen see if it's the revelation of christ if he can reveal himself tonight to you that he's present then you are in that church by the revelation notice we take his early ministry the first one we want to start off with here was andrew a fisherman he found him and perhaps he went back and told his brother simon come see who we found we found the messiah now they were looking for a messiah they thought john was the messiah many people believed he was but notice now we're going to find out what he was and when i can imagine peter saying not just a minute of course his name is simon then he said uh andrew you probably got off on a deep end somewhere on some kind of a tantrum i know when the messiah comes my whole father told me said son one day when we were sitting down for the lake after fishing i can see his gray hairs he said simon my boy your dad is always long to see the day when the messiah would arise but i'm getting old now i perhaps won't see it but simon don't you forget this that when he comes there'll be many things taking place you must remember simon you be scriptural the bible says our readings tell us moses the prophet said when the messiah comes he will be a prophet for it is written in the book of the law the lord god shall raise up a prophet like an unto me is that scripture and remember you'll not be just a fancy person but he'll be a a plain man a prophet a great prophet a god prophet when he comes and you've been well instructed in that so when andrew come and told him come see jesus of nazareth he is that prophet i can imagine simon saying now just a minute i don't know what's happened to you but surely you haven't forgot the teaching of the scripture but just for old time's sake i'll go with you when he walked up into the presence of the lord jesus jesus looked him in the face and said your name is simon and you are the son of jonas peter recognized it right quick that that must be him not only did he know who he was but he know who his father was there was one staying there by the name of philip the one we read about tonight it thrilled his heart in such a way he had to go tell his friend about it there's something about knowing jesus christ when you ever really find the real christ you can't sit still you've got to tell it somewhere so we see philip taking off around the hill if he's ever in palestine see where jesus is preaching around the world his friend nathaniel lived it's about 15 miles no doubt he ran around that mountain let's this dramatized it for a moment i can see him knock at the door little sick children here i want him to get it there's simple little faith knocked at the door perhaps mrs nathanael came to the door he said didn't have time to have much kind of a greeting he said where's nathanael said oh he's back into the uh orchard back there of praying back in the orchard and back to the orchard he went and he already found him under a tree praying i believe a philip being a christian man he didn't interrupt him when he was praying actually he got through his prayer and said amen got up and dusted off his clothes and just then he looked around and seen his friend phillip he said philip i'm glad to meet you again have you come to visit me my brother well there's something about it when a man gets ahold of god and god gets a hold of the man he went right straight to the point that come see who we have found come and see jesus of nazareth the son of joseph and now you know nathanael was a staunch orthodox believer now wait a minute phillip i've known you to be a good solid man but could that come any good thing out of nazareth i think he gave him the best answer that any man could give don't sit home and criticize it come see come look it over yourself examine it by the scriptures and see if it's right that's a good idea come see for yourself don't criticize come and find out oh our imagination nathaniel said now wait what organization did he come through that would be the 1961 version of it but he didn't say now wait a minute we know if messiah comes you'll come to cahephasis campus is the high priest he's the greatest religious in the country or we know he'd come to the bishop or the general overseer or somebody like that but god goes where he wants to and the son of our business what he does he does it to suit himself amen certainly he never come to anyone but he come to the porn fishermen and in a manger and the shepherds and so forth notice as they went on their way i can imagine them talking having a little that do you remember uh nathanael you are a well versed scholar tell me nathanael what is this messiah to be that's promised us how will we know him according to the law that while he'll be a prophet because moses said the lord your god shall raise up a prophet like and unto me he'll be a god prophet you know the jews always believe they're prophets for the bible said if there'd be one among you who's spiritual or prophet i the lord will make myself known to him and what he says comes to pass then hearing or i'm with him that's the way to judge this meeting tonight if the word says so in the holy spirit's true it'll manifest it if it doesn't then it's not the holy spirit that's judge it by your own self and by the word then he said you remember that old fisherman that you bought the fish from that time down on the river and he couldn't sign his name for your receipt yeah you know his name is simon yes his brother brought him to the meeting yesterday before i left and as soon as he walked up in the presence of jesus he looked at him and said your name is simon you remember his dad sure and he said your father's name is jonas that was jesus yesterday that's why jesus made himself known as the messiah if that's the way he did it yesterday he'll have to do it today if he's the same yesterday today and forever he'll be the god prophet watch what he did he said it wouldn't surprise me if he didn't tell you who you were when you come up in the meeting ah i have to see it finally they arrived maybe he walked into the prayer line where jesus praying for the sick maybe he set out the audience i do not know but however when jesus fastened his eyes on him he said behold an israelite and whom there's no guile how did he know him oh he's saying where he dressed oh no all of them dressed the same the easterners wore turbans he could have been a greek he could have been arabian they wore turbans and loose hanging garments he didn't astonished himself until he stopped and said rabbi means teacher when did you ever know me well you never see me in your life how do you know that i'm a was an israelite and an honest and just man i could see those eyes look back at him again and say before philip called you when you were under the tree i saw you day before and 15 miles around the mountains what eyes what did this fella say the rabbi thou art the son of god you're the king of israel sure he was taught he knowed what you believed he know that was the prophet that moses spoke of god the son of god god the king of israel and jesus said because i told you this you believe now i said yes he said then you'll see greater than this or you'll see angels descending and ascending but there was some standing there who didn't believe that the great scholars of the day they had to answer their congregation because the congregation is going to ask them the question so you know what they said they couldn't figure it out how he knew those things perceived their thoughts so forth and was a prophet you could tell them what was and what was coming see it so perfectly because the scripture said that would be the messiah if that was a sign of messiah yesterday the same stein is the sign of messiah today not because some men walk down the street with scars in his hand blood and oil pouring from him or whatever it might be with a robe on that could be a hypocrite but brother the life inside the vine tells what it is jesus said i'm the vine you're the branches if the first branch come out of that vine produced the pentecostal church and wrote a book of acts behind it if that same vine produces another branch they'll do the same thing behind it a grapevine puts forth grapes but cheeto is is western people here i've seen the citrus tree here in arizona i believe that about eight or nine different kinds of citrus fruit on it but it's grafted and today we got too much grafted into the church the it can't bear the fruit you put up an orange tree and put a lemon branch in it it'll bury lemons it lives off the life of the tree but it bears its own fruit lemon and so is that today we got churches that call themselves christian churches but they bear the marks of theology and of organization but if that pentecostal vine that made a pentecostal church ever put forth another pentecostal branch it'll be like it was at the beginning exactly right if jesus christ appears in the church he'll be the same as he was back there it won't bear lemons or grapefruits that'll bear oranges if it's an orange tree and it puts forth its branch it'll not be organizations it'll not be denominations it'll be christ correctly amen notice they stood with their hands behind him they know they had to answer because he didn't speak well of them well they said he does this to the power of the elder bub elder above the devil and anybody knows that fortune telling is of the devil all those things are of the devil and everything the devil has is something is perverted from real the devil cannot create he's not a creator he's only one creator that's god he can pervert what has been created a good woman can be in the world more and just the devil can pervert her and make her wicked one what is the lie is the truth misrepresented what is evil is righteousness perverted that's what what is unbelief is belief perverted the devil perverts but cannot create he's no creator is one creator that's god you could create anything you wanted to if he was a creator but only one creator and that is god now we find those fellows that are saying that this man was doing this to the power of the devil listen listen close now don't miss this jesus turned to them and said i forgive you for that calling him a devil calling the spirit of god that was doing those works a devil said i forgive you but someday the holy spirit's coming to do the same thing and one word against it will never be forgiven in this world neither in the world it is to come do you see where we stand all right we noticed that was jesus yesterday oh how we could go however down there in the city of jericho i imagine little zacchaeus got up in a tree and said now i'm going to watch him pass by but of course i heard my wife say that if he could pursue discern the thoughts of mine and think not only i'm doing any of that on me so i'll be set up here in a tree i'll watch but when jesus is coming around hallelujah avenue and down glory road we turn the corner there and you're still zach gets up in the tree all camouflaged maybe a leaf just raised up looking out oh i'd like to see him he said when he passed by i heard my wife say that he could speak the thoughts of the mind and he could do these things to tell me he's the prophet but i'll tell you you sure be some prophet you know where i was at but i fully now got behind these bushes here sitting on a fork and limb that's where a lot of people sets where your way in god's way meets you gotta take one of them oh seems sitting up there looking over this leaf looking down jesus walking straight and quietly come down the tree and lift you up said zacchaeus come on down going home with you today oh mom that was jesus yesterday he's the same yesterday and forever be jesus today remember when he went through he didn't do that himself saint john 19 we could go to that well let's go to saint john 5 19. jesus said he passed through the gate called beautiful and uh the pools rather bethesda i get to that in a few minutes to get a beautiful day he passed through besides the gate where the pool was and that was great multitudes of lame blind halt withered laying there probably all kinds of afflicted people the bible said great multitudes and he passed by them never touched in one of them yet full compassion full of love walked around till he found a man laying on a pallet how many of you don't know what a pallet is or what part of kentucky are you from i was raised on one sleep in the door hot weather and this man is laying on a pallet perhaps he he might have had prostrate trouble or he might have had two burglar it was he had it 38 years but remember jesus knew all about it knew where he was laying and he came to him and said will thou be made whole passing by the rest of them will thou be made old he said i have no one to put me in the water he could walk said while i'm coming somebody else outruns him gets in the pool first and he said take up thy bed and go into the house and then jesus's question of it if he come to this city and did the same thing tonight he'd still be questioning but what did he say listen think john 5 19 verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing that do it the son likewise jesus never performed one miracle without the father showing him first or he told something wrong there verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing in himself no doubt this sin why didn't you heal mr jones over there he's sold pencils on the street for so long here's old sister cass horn over here well she's at arthur right a few years why didn't you heal her she's a good woman she's a member of my synagogue he said i do just as the father shows me the father worketh and i work in the other jews oh i asked jesus yesterday that's jesus today the same jesus works as the father shows him amen we noticed it we see a woman coming through and she said if i could just touch the hymn of his garment saint john if i could touch the hem of his garment ivy made well and she pressed through now he couldn't feel her touch just by simply feeling it physically because the palestinian garment hangs loose and had underneath garment to keep dust off their limbs then they had that's reason they washed feet and the hem of his garment i couldn't tell you to touch my coat and how about that garment hanging loose but he felt the spirit oh man was around him but that little woman touched him and she stood up for she stayed within herself if i could just touch the bar of his garment i'll be made well and jesus stopped and said who touched me and simon peter said rebuked him and said why do you say a thing like that say well all of them is touching it he said but i perceive that i have gotten weak virtues gone from me and he looked around over the audience until he found the little woman and he told her a blood issue and said thy faith has saved thee that was jesus yesterday and tonight at the clergyman the bible said that jesus christ tonight is a high priest setting in glory that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities if you touch jesus night like that woman did then how would he act he'd act the same way he did then if he's the same yesterday and forever he'd turn and say you had so and so but now thy faith has healed thee if he's the same now remember there's only it's closing there's only three classes of people or three um nationalities really in the world that's ham shame and japan's people that's the three sons of noah we believe the bible and all the human race sprang from them three sons if we're gonna believe the word that was jew gentile and samaritan now remember the samaritans and the jews uh samaritans had jew and gentile so they were looking for a messiah and the real true in heart he revealed himself to them and that was his decision remember his decision to make yourself knowing as messiah for showing them that sign them that believed him had eternal life those that rejected him went off into everlasting destruction now we find him that's how he made himself known to the jews we could go look at blind bartimaeus and how oh the scriptures we could refer to now remember he also said he had need to go by samaria saint john 4. he was on his road to jericho he had to go up around the hill to samaria and when he got to the samaria he sent his disciples into the city to buy some food around noon he sat on the well a panoramic something like this there was a i'd say a beautiful young woman came out we were here in america as being a prostitute she had bunches of husbands she lived with and she came out to get her water maybe because you've been out all night and slept up to noon usually the virgins go to the well early in the morning you ought to watch them how they wind all that water out and put a five gallon jar on top of their head and one on each hip and walk and talk like ladies can never spill a drop of it but pardon me now but maybe she couldn't come with the nice people she had to come when all the estimate got their water so we find her coming out to the well and she starts to let her a little put the little hooks in the handles on the side of the jug and let it down to window up some water and she heard a voice saying woman bring me a drink and she looked over and she seen a jew sitting there a young man he looked well he was only 30 but the bible said he looked 50. you know that i guess his work done that to him well they said in saint john 6 chapter you say that you have seen abraham and you're a man not over 50 years old he said before abraham was i am i am within the burning bush you know so he said you're not over 50 years old so he's standing over against the wall and asking this woman for a drink now they had segregation there like they used to have in the south she said it's not customary for you jews to ask samaritan's samaritan woman that's not customary in these days listen to the conversation don't miss it he said if you knew who you were talking to hey i wonder not the church really knew the presence of the lord would share if you only knew who you were talking to you'd ask me for a drink not give you water that you don't come here to draw she said the wells deep you have nothing to draw with and the conversation what's he trying to do contact your spirit the father had sent him up there he didn't know why but this woman come out he's trying to contact her spirit he said um he said uh she said you say worship at jerusalem our fathers worshipped in this mountain you said jerusalem jesus said god's a spirit they that worship him with worshipping spirit and truth the conversation went on for a few minutes until he found water trouble was now listen it'll do you good in a few minutes see he talked to her until he found her trouble and he said go get your husband and come here she said i have no husband watch he's making them samaritans now he jumped into the jew said go get your husband and come here she said i have no husband he said you said well you've had five therefore the one you're living with now is not your husband you said the truth what did she do she know more about god and half the preachers does and her in that condition more than they did then anyhow she said sir she didn't call him blc bub a fortune teller said sir i perceive that you are a prophet i listen we know that when messiah comes which is called christ he'll tell us these things sign of the messiah we samaritans know that the messiah will do this sign so you must be his prophet jesus said i'm he that speaks to you oh my god see she is taught to know what the messiah would do not how he would dress but what he would do not what kind of teaching he'd have but he said if i do not to worse to my father then don't believe me they knew he'd be a god prophet she said you must be a prophet now we know when the messiah comes which you call christ he'll tell us all these things see that's the sign he would do but who are they who are you he said i'm he what she do she left the water pot she ran into the city and said come see a man who told me the things that i've done isn't this the very messiah and the bible said that the man of the city believed on him because the woman's testimony that he told her what her troubles was if that was his sign yesterday it's his sign today now look hunt through the scriptures and you'll never see one time he did that sign before a gentile why gentiles we angled saxon had clubs on our back in this caveman we wasn't looking for an old messiah messiah only comes to those who are looking for him now in closing my last comment i might say this i don't look at that clock back there and it makes me nervous notice there's so much to be said so much you could tie in but now remember ham sham and japan steeple the jews the samaritans and the gentiles now the jews and samaritans was looking for a messiah and he made himself known to them as a messiah by being able to show them that he was the prophet that moses spoke up that would come amen i all understand say amen all right now the gentiles has had 2 000 years and now the gentiles are coming to the end now what did we say this morning if god ever makes the decision and does anything one way he's got to do it the next time the same way or he did it wrong the first time you understand it now now just one more little scripture forgive me for just a moment i just got to get this here jesus said in luke 16 i believe it was as it was in the days of sodom [Music] so shall it be at the coming of the son of man do you ever read that i watch what happened in sodom out closely now we're going to start the prayer line there's always three classes of people abraham represented that called out church he was called out he separated himself from sodom and then there was a sodomite the wicked and there was also lot and the nominal christian down there lukewarm believer but he had separated himself from abraham because abraham was too poor out of the bearing grounds and took the rich places that's what the big classic churches have done today the rich but the true group the called out church now remember there's three classes two of them is down in sodom the satellite and also the uh the borderline believer lot and then there was abraham the called out group one day while sitting under his dope there was three men came up they had on clothes like man dust all over them and said they were strangers but they were more than strangers abraham being a man full of god believing god as soon as he's seen him he know there was something strange about him my sheep know my voice and so he ran out and met him and said come in and step out of the old and i'll fetch you a little water wash your feet and have a marshal of bread and then go on about your business you run into the tent told sarah said need some flour some meal make some takes on the earth and he ran out got a calf and killed it give it to his servant and said dress it and when they dressed it brought it out and they sat there and eat man eating like man and one kept looking down towards sodom finally two of them went down to sodom and this one and stayed behind told abraham said i'll not keep it a secret from you what i'm going to do he said i i've heard about the sodom being in that condition i've come down to investigate abraham knew that was god now a minister said to me not long ago and i made that remark he said do you mean that that man was god i said abraham said he was he's called el or him see if it isn't right elohim he said in a body of flesh i said absolutely you don't know how great our god is i said einstein walk out of heaven reach out we made out of 16 elements petroleum potassium cosmic light and petroleum he just got a handful that that step in your gable reached over another and stepped into another angel stepped into one himself and stepped right back out of it again i'm so glad i know him someday when i'm nothing but dust he'll call me and i'll answer him he'll call you you'll answer he's elohim self-existing one certainly now watch watch the sign he's done to the believer the called out church now there was a modern billy graham and them went on down and preached to them in sodom they didn't do no miracles only blinded him well the gospel blinds the unbeliever anyhow so they didn't do any miracles but called lot out of there him and his wife and children out of sodom but watch the one that's come to the elected church the one in the minority he close his back to the tent women and them days not like they are now after out take their husband's place and do all the talking they stay back in the tent where they belong so then he was wasn't brazing as they are all my that's your old business brother straighten that out but anyhow notice this man sat with his back to the tent and he said abraham where is your wife sarah how do you know he was married how do you know his wife's name is sarah now watch the bible said abraham said she is in the tent behind you and he said abraham ah i personally pruned him again i'm going to visit you according to the promise i gave you sarah was 90 years old and i'm going to visit you according to the promise to give us you're going to have that baby and sarah in the tent laughed in herself and the angel with his back turned said why did sarah laugh what was that knowing her name was sarah give him the promise and note she laughed at herself in the tent jesus said as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man the gentiles had two thousand years of theology like the samaritan did now what was it an angel god to be working in human flesh that's what it was it was god in a human form now christ when he died he sanctified a church that he himself might come back and live in this church and do the thing that he did shall you do also is that right pardon me now if he's the same yesterday and forever he'll do like he did yesterday and we'll do it today and we'll be forever is that right now sirs we would see jesus where is he today he's in his church who is his church to call down what kind of a sign will he do as he promised how will he work at the same way he did when he come to abraham the same way he did when he comes to the jews the same way he did when he come to the samaritans and promised it at the end of the gentile age now if we can see him come on the scene no matter how much he would anoint me he's got to annoy you too when he come to his own city and many mighty works he could not do because of their unbelief so he has to know and shoot he has to anoint me and that makes the world see that jesus christ is the same because he's working in his church in human flesh that he is sanctified with his own blood for the purpose of manifesting himself making himself the same yesterday today and forever a little while and the world won't see any more now the world their spell is the greek word cosmos which means the world order see the world won't see me no more yet ye shall see me ye that's the believer the church for i will be with you even in you to the end of the world jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever do you believe it with these few promises that i've said to you tonight not because he dressed different not because he belonged to any clan not because he belonged to an organization there wasn't such a thing in them days that didn't make him jesus that didn't make him god but the works that he did prove that his commission that he said he would stand on was truth is that right well if he's the same yesterday and forever and promised the same work that he did the church would do don't you believe it if it doesn't then his words are true than if he done it to the samaritans but to the jews and promised it to the gentiles in the last day before the coming of the son of man oh what day we're living in brother we're here we're at the end time brother sister it's most any time it can happen remember when they turned it down you know what happened sodom burned the jews was destroyed and now we're at the gentile age of 2 000 years oh listen the prophet said there will be a day that will be dismal it can't be called night or day but in the evening time it shall be light is that right now the same sun rises in the east sets in the west the s-o-n who came in the east to eastern people and poured out the spirit upon them in the eastern we've had two thousand years of church organizations just a dismal day enough to see how to join the church and live a good life but at sunsetting time the same sun with the same thing that he had in the east shines it on the earth again in the west and we're on the west coast if we go any farther civilizations travel with the sun we'd be back east again so we're in the evening time with evening light with the same holy spirit that was on him is in the church doing the same things jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever that's our head gracious god one word from you will be more than any man could say in a lifetime we read that it's true oh god but the people are saying now let's see if it works certainly lord it's got to work it's got the zero to the target it's got to be so you promised it i pray that you'll manifest yourself tonight lord these people love you and they're sick this man sitting here holding this little waterhead baby this poor old dad sitting over here coughing this mother sitting in a wheelchair one earth of cane white in the hand oh god they cry past me not old gentle savior you're my humble cry while on others our calling do not pass me by for thou the stream of all my comfort more than life to me whom are thou on earth decide thee are whom in heaven but thee let it be known this night lord i have spoke of you i speak it i have told the truth father that will confirm the word and these people will believe and they'll be healed and go home happy and grant that there'll be a revival break out here in this city and literally thousands of souls will be won to christ and every church packed out new churches built it may be an example of people come from east and west to see the glory of god grant it lord we committed all in your hands now i am finished there's no more i can say it's up to you to speak now father because the people sees it's a promise just a few minutes here to lecture a little bit i trust that the holy spirit will take the word right down deep in their heart that they'll not fail to get it i pray in jesus name amen pardon my coughing i'm preaching all time i got just the preacher's throat and the other day i got real wet and kind of been a little hacky sensitive up there in in beaumont texas so now i i want you to remember now if we could see him tonight come and do just like he did then would we be like those who went home from emmaus they walked all day with him and didn't know it that night he act like it passed by he may act the same way to you now like he's going to pass by you you might not have a prayer card you might not even be in the line but he won't pass you just invite him to let me touch you lord see what he does oh he's not a challenge think of that it's more of a challenge than to walk down to this woman in a wheelchair and say and stand up and walk certainly she could actually do that through psychic power right mentally she could do it for christian science faith it's been done but when you see christ come into the people and do the same manifestation of the spine of heaven given back in fulfilling of the word what a miracle what a power anything here i am in this silly night there's not a soul here that i know it i can look at and see not but my tape boy sitting right here brother gold the only person i know god knows every one of you now i am not him he's hero and now we can't call all that prayer cards at one time and i just like them come just a few at a time as they call her awake and i'm sure he said he'd give out cards words bill where oh eight one two hundred all right let's begin at one number one man who has prayer card a number one i'll call them so we can pack those that's in the wheelchairs and get them not the bible the other night that both of them can't be right one's right and the other is wrong let the god of the bible speak south africa same way before about 250 000 oh he's still god when the witch doctors just put the shame standing there the enemy the flight the next morning about seven or eight big van loads of just crutches and wheelchairs and planks that have been packed on was going down the street when sydney smith the mayor of durban called me said brother brown look out your window over towards the seacoast there come hundreds of people the day before was on crutches and wheelchairs with seven of them gripping african bands as long as them two posts together powell plum ha full of that coming with their hands up been at war with one other tribe walking the next day saying all things are possible only believe glory 25 000 healed at one time wow they wasn't all indoctrinated with everything they were virgin they heard the bible they believed it accepted it and it taken place i'll be a real reverend keep your seat be quiet i don't mean say you can't praise god but just keep quiet listen now now in the name of jesus christ the son of god i'll take every spirit in here under my control for the glory of god now be careful answer that now i guess that in this prayer line here every one of you are strangers to me is that right raise up your hand if your strangers raise up your hand i do not know you now if i could heal you and wouldn't do it i'd be a hypocrite but i can't do what god's already done i can only what if he was standing here tonight with this suit on it he gave me you say lord will you heal me you know what he'd say my child have already done that i can't do it twice i've just done it once as you must believe it but then he might show show you something to prove that he was the messiah now not the nail prince because anybody could have nail prints in their hands but he'd do the same sign that he did the first time as he promised he would do he'd never go beyond his promises what he promised he'll do now here's a woman you were strangers to one another all right you read my book she said she'd read my books and she thought she almost knowed me by reading my books all right then my sister i have a mother at home tonight he's praying for me i didn't come down here to be a defeat i come here to be a brother i didn't come to take the doctor's face i come to help his patients to get well i know never come representing any certain church just the lord jesus christ now this is the first time as far as i know we've ever met then if i would come you perhaps if you're in the prayer line you'd be sick and if i'd say i want to put my hands on you and say receive your healing in the name of the lord jesus go believe you'd have a right to do that that's true that's right but now what if he would come here and tell you something that you have done or like you did the woman at the well talked to her and revealed to her what what her trouble was then you'd know that it wasn't me wouldn't it because i don't know you i've never here's my hands i hold my hands to god over his bible i've never seen her in my life i know nothing about it and that's true i don't know one person in that prayer line or no who are out there as i can see but those that are called the name but now christ remains the same doesn't it now if he will if this woman let her be the judge if you all know her here at the church or wherever she's from if if she if he can tell her what she has been what something is wrong with her or what she share for it maybe domestic finance uh i don't know but if he can reveal that will that make him the same yesterday today and forever how many will believe that i'll raise up your answer i love him and believing thank you almost a hundred percent now if you do not believe it but be quiet because you know what happened lots of times afflictions goes from one to another it's got to find a place you remember in the bible then it'll go from one to another oh i've seen so much done like that so just as a brother i'll say if you don't believe it just set reverently and keep your head down so it's over now the words that i've spoke of jesus christ now has to be manifested or either i've told a liar his bible told something wrong now if anybody don't believe it wants to take my place you're welcome to come up here and take but as long as god made a promise he keeps his promise when the age of the lord met me up there 14 years ago and told me these things i was born to do and noted all my life and the baptist brethren tried to tell me it was the devil and everything they come to find out the very god of heaven trying to get to me i believed it ever since it's alarmed the world i've seen literally millions come to crime around the world now here it is in tucson for the first time here it is the bible here's the promise but will it work it'll work when he works that's all uh if the lord reveals to me what's wrong with the woman how many of us go to accept him as your healer you're with both of us with our hands up we've never met before in life you said she'd read my book so she has some idea of what would take place if he would do it now whether he will or not remember i don't know if he doesn't do it then i'll just simply go down the prayer line praying for the sick and let it go up fast that's all i could do but he's never failed me i don't believe he will tonight i want to talk to you just an adventure the first person all right our lord did the woman that so well he's trying to contact your spirit very beautiful to be a woman the first one in the prayer line just got through that of saint john 4. now i can just see him sitting there and see that woman come out to get what and he began to question me i believe now you know the lyric has to almost take my word for that i believe he is trying to contact her spirit the father had set him up there he had needs go by and he said he did nothing till the father showed him so the father had to show him first that's why he found out where her trouble was he told her what her trouble was and she said well that's the sign of the messiah i know when he comes he'll tell us all things so you must be a prophet he said i'm he and she went and told the city would that be your attitude towards it knowing it me being your brother and don't know you never seen me in my life we're born probably miles apart and years apart and here's our first time meeting and if he will reveal to me what your trouble is will you accept him as messiah you will you do the woman shattered to death the dark shadow hangs over and she's suffering with cancer that is right if that's right raise up your hand now do you believe it now i feel that coming to me again he guessed that don't think that you can't hide yourself now he's here already anointed now i never guessed that well wait a minute let's put a stop to that now you're fine person i don't know what he told you the only thing he told you i have to find on this paper and see what he said it's just like going back down to the stream of life somewhere inside y'all see it coming again yeah it's a shadow it's darkness it's a cancer now if i'll tell you where that cancer is would you believe me to be his prophet it's on both frets that's right raise up your hand another thing to that your doctor told you it's going into the spine also that's right working just fine faith if the lord jesus will tell me who you are without making the same god you could sit with that right miss hall right you're not from here you're from a coal country real coal is full of mountains is colorado that's thus stay at the lord do you breathe on him with all your heart return and be healed in the name of jesus christ and may his blessings and mercy dress up on you and give you the prayer now are you convinced that he is the same messiah no not me it's him not don't move around folks see you're each one of spirit and every time you move it just bothers me terribly see that's still but real still be quiet watch this the way just don't move see each one of you is the spirit and that anointing comes it's just just like a stream and i'm in contact with you and you're in contact with god as you contact god he just speaks this way this microphone is that is a mute it's got to have something to speak into it am i just the mute on these things it's got to have something to speak in so each one when you move or go around or do something see jesus took a man outside the city one time you get see just be real reverend watch out if you want to praise god that's all right but don't get up and walk around on things like that it interferes get a spirit holy spirit's very timid real timing course you didn't know it maybe goes down let's be real ready not worth the next person i'm not beside myself but it's anointing for my young person do you believe me to be god's servant that's what the angel said you get the people to believe you that be sincere when you pray now you're just a young woman and i've never seen you in my my life i guess restraint i suppose your spanish you but uh i don't
