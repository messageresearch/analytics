[14:44] decided to follow
[14:48] Jesus I won't turn
[14:51] back I won't turn
[14:56] back amen I have decided because of
[14:59] there was something inside me that was
[15:01] pulling back that way amen and I said
[15:04] yes Lord amen while we were up there and
[15:07] the services up there in
[15:09] Cottonwood their piano player had had
[15:12] left and
[15:14] was wasn't coming to church anymore so
[15:16] they used any piano player that came in
[15:19] so we got to hear a few different piano
[15:21] players and it was nice every style was
[15:25] different and and but you know what we
[15:27] worshiped and we praise the Lord anyway
[15:29] so and the piano players have to put up
[15:32] with us that's usually the the way it
[15:34] goes but you know as as as we've been
[15:38] going through the the Old Testament
[15:40] books and I was telling brother Lyall me
[15:42] and my wife were talking coming in how
[15:45] this study has changed my whole
[15:47] view of the Old Testament in a sense to
[15:51] me it was just a history book you know
[15:54] oh this happened this happened we'd pull
[15:56] a scripture out here and pull a
[15:57] scripture out but more I'm realizing how
[16:00] much brother brandom said if you don't
[16:01] find Christ in every chapter in every
[16:04] book he said you're reading it wrong and
[16:06] I'm we're both talking about how much it
[16:08] has has meant so much to us so
[16:11] appreciate the brothers doing what
[16:13] they're doing in a way that I still
[16:16] Marvel that they can do it that way but
[16:19] we're all different and God knows that
[16:22] so as brother Dan prepares to to come
[16:26] out as I was listening to brother
[16:29] Jordan's testimony on Monday and then
[16:32] yesterday I listened to brother
[16:34] Dan and I just was thanking the lord for
[16:37] what he's done for us and all and I said
[16:40] something said you know what we're
[16:41] longing for we're longing for that home
[16:45] bu land I'm longing for

[22:51] year in the message then and we just
[22:53] popped in the bookstore sister Shan was
[22:54] there at the time but we've never been
[22:56] in a service with you so I wanted to

[23:00] Robson and Phoenix so brother McGary but
[23:03] originally um we're from Cloverdale
[23:05] Bible way I know jiaho and I've met some
[23:08] of you at camps and so forth the
[23:09] Petersons and so so forth and but about
[23:12] 14 years ago we started a little work on
[23:14] the island Vancouver Island and Victoria
[23:16] there so about six years ago we moved
[23:18] over there and uh a small group about 20
[23:21] of us there's no website you won't find
[23:23] us but there's been people that have
[23:24] come to the Lord It's a university town
[23:26] it's the capital of the province they
[23:28] come converted maybe they go back home
[23:30] or they move somewhere else in Canada so
[23:32] we're just happy to do something for the
[23:34] Lord and um I'm I really want to just
[23:37] say I'm I'm grateful for this Tabernacle
[23:39] for the ministry for the people here
[23:41] it's been a blessing to me that the past
[23:43] Ministry and the present and Lord
[23:44] willing the future also back home I've
[23:47] been preaching about the will of God and
[23:48] I've been using Brother Perry Green's
[23:49] example of the three lights you lying
[23:52] those three lights up right no scripture
[23:54] against you it's got to be the desire
[23:57] burden from the Lord and the Lord opens
[23:58] the door so we've been speaking about
[24:00] that back home it's been a real blessing
[24:02] and our church is until 3:30 in the
[24:03] afternoon so we've streamed you a few
[24:05] times seen some of the baptisms up there
[24:08] so really appreciate what you're doing
[24:09] you know if you ever come to the island
[24:11] I would like to take you to a place
[24:12] called fisgard Lighthouse has anybody
[24:14] been there nobody Josiah has been there
[24:17] okay you can go up in the lighthouse and
[24:20] you can see the old records of the old
[24:21] lightkeepers and some of them only
[24:23] lasted a week wow cuz it's so they were
[24:26] so lonely and so repetitive
[24:28] every day you got to keep the oil and
[24:30] the light going you got to wash the
[24:31] windows and the mirrors every day you
[24:33] got to remove the dead seagulls that
[24:35] crashed into the building and so it's
[24:37] very repetitive and very lonely but some
[24:40] of them lasted a long time right and
[24:42] that rep repetition and that labor
[24:45] provided a service it provided a light
[24:46] to warn people of danger and sometimes
[24:49] you don't even you don't even see the
[24:50] benefits of what you're doing but some
[24:52] ship misses danger because of you and
[24:55] they give testimony somewhere else and
[24:56] say praise God that Lighthouse helped me
[24:58] void danger but sometimes the lighthous
[25:00] keepers don't see the benefit of what
[25:02] you're doing so I just want to encourage
[25:04] you to keeping a lighthouse and we'll
[25:05] keeping a lighthouse by the grace of God
[25:07] where we are and we're really happy just
[25:09] humbled to be here with you and toan for
[25:11] the first time uh in person so um God
[25:14] bless you richly and looking forward to
[25:15] the service with you
[25:22] tonight thank you brother Kyle he he did
[25:26] um here's a blessing I read his book and
[25:29] uh it um it really it was a perspective
[25:33] that I I really
[25:34] appreciated um and brothers and sisters
[25:38] what better thing could we be than a
[25:40] lighthouse to this world and and the
[25:42] Bible tells us that we are a light to
[25:45] the world but don't hide that light
[25:47] under a bushel Let It Shine forth to all
[25:51] men Let's uh let's stand and um we can
[25:55] get into the the book of Nehemiah here
[25:58] as I said for our visitors we have a
[26:00] Wednesday night bible study we're going
[26:01] through every book of the Bible we
[26:04] started actually in the book of Acts and
[26:06] we read every single word in the book of
[26:07] Acts we went chapter by chapter line by
[26:10] line and then we finished it it took us
[26:15] I mean a good part of a year and we
[26:18] finished it and I thought well you know
[26:21] what best place to starts Genesis let's
[26:23] go there so we're devoting one service
[26:27] per book of the Bible
[26:29] and as I said that's what we're doing on
[26:31] our Wednesday night services let's turn
[26:33] to the book of Nehemiah chapter 1 this
[26:36] is nehemiah's prayer to the
[26:38] Lord verse
[26:42] five and I said I beseech thee Oh god of
[26:47] Heaven the great and terrible God that
[26:49] keepeth Covenant and mercy for them that
[26:52] love him and observe his Commandments
[26:55] let thine ear now be attentive and thine
[26:57] eyes open
[26:58] that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy
[27:01] servant which I pray before thee now day
[27:04] and night for the children of Israel thy
[27:06] servants and confess the sins of the
[27:10] children of Israel which we have sinned
[27:12] against thee both I and my father's
[27:15] house have sinned We have dealt very
[27:17] corruptly against thee and have not kept
[27:20] the Commandments nor the statutes nor
[27:21] the judgments which thou commandest thy
[27:24] servant Moses remember I beseech Thee
[27:27] the word that thou commandest thy
[27:29] servant Moses saying if ye transgress I
[27:31] will scatter you abroad among the
[27:34] Nations but if ye turn unto me and keep
[27:37] my Commandments and do them though there
[27:40] were of You cast out unto the uttermost
[27:43] parts of Heaven yet will I gather them
[27:46] from then and will bring them unto the
[27:49] place that I have chosen to set my name
[27:52] there now these are thy servants and thy
[27:56] people whom thou Hast Redeemed by thy
[27:59] great power and by thy strong hand oh
[28:02] Lord I beseech thee let now thine ear be
[28:06] attentive to the prayer of thy servant
[28:08] and to the prayer of thy servants who
[28:10] desire to fear thy name and prosper I
[28:14] pray thee thy servant this day and Grant
[28:17] him Mercy in the sight of this man for I
[28:20] was the king's cup Bearer amen God bless
[28:24] you all you can take your seat so then
[28:27] this this
[28:29] man who is in the line of David who is
[28:34] in the line of the Lord Jesus himself
[28:37] named zerubabel he has a burden to bring
[28:43] the people out of what was once Babylon
[28:46] now is taken over by Persia bring them
[28:49] back home to
[28:51] Jerusalem that was zerubabel he brings
[28:55] them back and then there was this man
[28:57] that brother Josiah talked about last
[28:59] week or two weeks ago this man's name
[29:02] was Ezra the Lord raised up the burden
[29:06] in Ezra's heart to rebuild this Temple
[29:09] of worship in Jerusalem so now we have
[29:13] the temple being rebuilt Ezra was there
[29:17] for about 14 years and then the Lord
[29:21] lays it on another man's heart and that
[29:25] is this man named Nehemiah Nehemiah was
[29:28] a very important person to the
[29:31] king um the king's name is Artis Xerxes
[29:35] Artis Xerxes is actually and brother ly
[29:38] will be talking about this when we get
[29:40] to Esther Artis Xerxes is Esther's um
[29:45] stepson so AR Xerxes as I said he's the
[29:49] King of Persia and his cup Bearer which
[29:53] was a very very important position back
[29:56] then this cup bearer was was the one who
[29:59] basically he you know and the you see in
[30:02] the movies and stuff the you see the the
[30:05] the person that drinks the drink or eats
[30:07] the food before the king eats it so it's
[30:09] not poisoned well that was his job and
[30:12] it's not like you have some Brutus over
[30:14] there saying yeah give me a bite of that
[30:15] you know and I didn't die so no this was
[30:18] a very very important person that the
[30:20] king trusted very very highly right so
[30:25] here's Nehemiah and he
[30:28] gets
[30:30] word that the
[30:34] um the temple had been
[30:36] rebuilt but there's a problem in
[30:40] Jerusalem the temple is built but there
[30:43] is nothing surrounding the city to
[30:47] protect the people in the temple for PE
[30:50] from invading armies just to come in and
[30:52] steal whatever they want so the Lord
[30:55] lays it on the heart of this man
[30:58] Nehemiah to to return to Jerusalem now
[31:02] he was born in captivity he'd probably
[31:05] never been there but he the Jews they
[31:09] just something about their Homeland I
[31:11] talked about Zionism on Sunday morning
[31:14] it's nothing new that these people long
[31:17] to be back home in their Homeland that
[31:22] is where they are comfortable that is
[31:24] where God has always dealt with Israel
[31:28] is in their Homeland we talked about the
[31:30] dispersion and how they had gone out
[31:32] around the world and God promised in the
[31:35] last days through Zachariah and through
[31:38] many other prophecies that he would
[31:40] bring them back into their Homeland and
[31:43] we have seen that in this day and we've
[31:46] seen the the their power just continue
[31:48] to raise and and they they're able to
[31:51] defend themselves now that is the
[31:54] Fulfillment of all these scriptures well
[31:56] here is Nehemiah and he has this same
[31:59] feeling yeah I want to be home I want to
[32:02] help my people so
[32:05] Nehemiah as I said he's the cup Bearer
[32:08] to the king a very very trusted probably
[32:11] the most trusted person in all of Persia
[32:13] to tell you the truth besides maybe the
[32:15] king's
[32:16] wife so let's turn to chapter
[32:20] one and let's read the first part of it
[32:26] here chapter one
[32:28] now Ezra let me give a little background
[32:31] here Ezra and Nehemiah were originally
[32:34] one book they were written together they
[32:37] were probably written as brother Josiah
[32:39] told us by this man named Ezra this
[32:42] great scribe scholar named Ezra that put
[32:48] this together and much of Nehemiah Ezra
[32:50] is quoting
[32:53] Nehemiah so they were the the when they
[32:56] put the Bible together the two books
[32:58] were split
[33:00] apart chapter 1 the words of Nehemiah
[33:04] the son of
[33:05] hackelia and it came to pass in the
[33:08] month of shisu in the 20th year as I was
[33:12] in shushan the palace now that month is
[33:18] December and what probably happened back
[33:22] then is the king probably spent the
[33:26] summer months
[33:29] and the fall up higher in the mountains
[33:33] in the higher elevation which was this
[33:35] is this shushan up in Persia and then in
[33:38] the winter months he probably came to
[33:41] the lower elevations to spend the the
[33:45] those months in Babylon so we have these
[33:49] things Brother Kyle called snowbirds
[33:51] here in Tucson so the King of Persia was
[33:56] probably a snowbird
[34:02] and at this time he was up in British
[34:09] Columbia that Han that hanani one of the
[34:13] Brethren came he and a certain men of
[34:16] Judah and a and I asked them concerning
[34:18] the Jews that had escaped that had left
[34:21] they hadn't really escaped under duress
[34:24] Cyrus had let them go
[34:28] which were left of the Captivity
[34:30] concerning Jerusalem and they said unto
[34:32] me the remnant that are left of the
[34:35] Captivity there in the Prov Province are
[34:38] in great Affliction and reproach the
[34:41] wall of Jerusalem also is broken down
[34:43] and the gates thereof are burned with
[34:45] fire and it came to pass when I heard
[34:48] these words that I sat down and wept and
[34:51] mourned certain days and fasted and
[34:54] prayed before the god of Heaven now
[34:56] Nehemiah as I said before Nehemiah
[34:58] understands that now this Temple is
[35:00] rebuilt through Ezra but the walls are
[35:03] broken down and the gates are burned so
[35:06] any invading Army can just come in and
[35:09] and destroy the temple again there's no
[35:11] protection at all and do you see
[35:14] brothers and sisters I'll stop right
[35:16] here how the Lord places different
[35:18] burdens on different people yeah some
[35:21] people
[35:22] may have a burden to minister the gospel
[35:26] other people may have a burden to to to
[35:30] serve or to to be a deacon to keep order
[35:32] in the churches and like we heard from
[35:35] Brother um Jordan on Sunday brother
[35:38] Jordan's burden is to help in any way he
[35:42] can so we see that different people have
[35:47] different callings in life and this man
[35:50] Nehemiah he was a governor he was a he
[35:53] was a great man he was a ruler he had a
[35:56] burden to to come and start the
[35:59] construction of this wall around
[36:03] Jerusalem verse
[36:04] 5 and I said oh then he goes on and I
[36:09] already read this this was his prayer
[36:11] and so Nehemiah now he starts praying he
[36:16] he feels this burden and he he's praying
[36:19] and it doesn't happen right away when
[36:24] God might speak to us he might lay
[36:27] something on our
[36:29] hearts and just because it doesn't
[36:32] happen right away brothers and sisters
[36:33] doesn't mean just to move on to
[36:36] something else and doesn't mean that is
[36:38] it isn't God days started to go by and
[36:43] our brother Nehemiah would continued to
[36:45] pray he continued to Fast and the burden
[36:49] just got greater and greater months
[36:53] weeks and months went by four months
[36:58] went by and this man just this burden to
[37:01] go back home and to build these these
[37:04] protecting walls continued to grow so we
[37:08] go to chapter two he prays this prayer
[37:11] that I read earlier so we get we go to
[37:13] chapter 2 verse one says this and it
[37:16] came to pass in the month of Nissan it's
[37:19] in April in the 20th year so we went
[37:21] from December now now we're in April and
[37:24] it came to pass in the month of Nissan
[37:25] in the 20th year of arzer the king that
[37:28] wine was before him and I took up the
[37:31] wine and gave it unto the king now I had
[37:34] not been Before Time sad in his presence
[37:38] one of the things with the cup Bears
[37:40] back then remember their life had
[37:43] nothing to do with themselves their
[37:46] whole life was to serve the King right
[37:49] now you and I might if we're kind of
[37:51] down if something bad happens we might
[37:54] you know put on a sad face and want to
[37:57] get a little attention from somebody or
[37:59] want to get a little pad on the back or
[38:01] something like that there was none of
[38:02] this with this cup Bearer because if you
[38:05] were had a sad countenance you didn't
[38:07] want to bring that countenance into the
[38:09] king and make him sad because at best
[38:12] you would probably not be cup bear
[38:13] anymore at worst you would be no more
[38:17] period so this this cup bear position
[38:21] was all about the king so the king
[38:25] notices it the king said to me why is
[38:28] thy countenance sad seeing that thou art
[38:30] not sick this is nothing else but sorrow
[38:33] of the heart then I was very sore afraid
[38:39] you can see why he was afraid because of
[38:40] what I just
[38:45] said and said unto the king let the King
[38:48] live forever and ever I mean that was
[38:50] kind of his
[38:51] job eating the food making sure there's
[38:53] no poison there and all that let the
[38:55] King live for forever and ever why
[38:58] should not my countenance be sad when
[39:01] the king the place of my father's
[39:03] suppliers lith waste and the gates
[39:06] thereof are consumed with fire then the
[39:09] king said unto me for what Dost thou
[39:11] make request so I prayed to the god of
[39:14] heaven so the king he tells the king
[39:17] this he says listen he says all the
[39:19] walls and the gates are broken down and
[39:21] my
[39:22] homeland and he lays it before the king
[39:25] and then he'd been praying for 4 months
[39:28] now he gets this little short prayer and
[39:32] it must have been something like Lord
[39:34] help
[39:34] me this is when all of those prayers and
[39:38] all of that fasting and everything all
[39:41] of that came to this point right here
[39:44] where it was either life or death and
[39:48] also it was life or death for his
[39:52] people and he
[39:54] said and the King said unto me for what
[39:57] Dost thou make his repress so I prayed
[40:00] to God to the god of heaven and I said
[40:03] unto the king if it please thee King and
[40:06] If thy servant have found favor in thy
[40:08] sight thou wouldest send me to Judah
[40:12] unto the city of my father's suppliers
[40:15] that I may build it now notice right
[40:18] here the wisdom of Nehemiah he he
[40:20] doesn't say Lord he doesn't say King if
[40:22] you'll let me go he says if you will
[40:26] send me
[40:28] because if he
[40:29] sent then he has the authority of the
[40:32] king as he goes it's the same thing with
[40:35] us Brother Kyle if we say Lord if you
[40:37] will let me do this it's different we're
[40:40] going out on our own but if you if the
[40:42] Lord sends us then we go on the
[40:45] authority of the king wow so it was
[40:48] nehemiah's desire to go but Watch What
[40:52] Happens now when the king is behind you
[40:55] and the King said unto me
[40:57] the queen also sitting by him for how
[41:00] long shall thy journey be and when wilt
[41:03] thou return so it pleased the king to
[41:06] send me and I set him a time so he tells
[41:10] him I'm going to I'm going to go but I
[41:13] will I promise I'll come back so
[41:16] Nehemiah made his commitment to return
[41:19] after he accomplished his goal moreover
[41:21] I said unto the king if it please the
[41:23] king let letters be given me to the
[41:26] governors beyond the river that they may
[41:28] convey me over till I come into Judah
[41:31] and a letter unto ASA The Keeper of the
[41:34] king's Forest that he may give me Timber
[41:36] to make beams for the gates of the
[41:39] palace which appertain to the house and
[41:42] for the wall of the city and for the
[41:44] house that I shall enter into and the
[41:46] King granted me according to the good
[41:48] hand of my God upon me so now he's going
[41:53] the king pays his way and now this King
[41:56] of Persia is going to pay for the
[41:59] materials to rebuild this
[42:02] wall then I came to the governors beyond
[42:04] the river and gave them the king's
[42:06] letters now the king had sent captains
[42:10] of the Army and the horsemen with me
[42:12] when sand ballot the horonite and toah
[42:17] the servant the ammonite heard of it it
[42:21] grieved them exceedingly that there was
[42:23] come a man to seek the welfare of the
[42:26] children of Israel so brothers and
[42:29] sisters whenever the Lord lays something
[42:31] on our heart to do it he will provide
[42:34] everything that we need but don't think
[42:37] that there's not going to be opposition
[42:40] there always will be especially if you
[42:42] are in the Lord's
[42:45] will so these three
[42:47] guys that are causing problems they're
[42:51] prominent throughout the rest of the
[42:53] book of Nehemiah they're always causing
[42:55] problems and they're even successful as
[42:58] we will read in a little while they're
[42:59] even successful in sowing some seed of
[43:03] Discord and CA casting doubt on the
[43:06] Jewish people that are going to be
[43:08] building the
[43:09] walls Nehemiah continues here he says so
[43:11] I came to Jerusalem and was there three
[43:14] days and I arose in the night I and some
[43:18] few men with me neither told I any man
[43:21] what my God had put in my heart to do at
[43:24] Jerusalem neither was there any Beast
[43:26] with me me save the Beast that I rodee
[43:28] upon now it's important here Nehemiah
[43:31] kept his intentions to himself he didn't
[43:34] want the enemy to have any fuel for his
[43:38] fire he didn't want anyone to know so he
[43:40] goes out and he starts walking in the
[43:45] city and he starts inspecting the walls
[43:49] in the gates and this is at night so he
[43:51] must have been in the
[43:52] moonlight just him by himself and he's
[43:56] going along I believe the the wall
[43:59] around Jerusalem is a couple miles long
[44:01] so it doesn't take that long so he goes
[44:04] and he's maybe taking notes and and he
[44:08] sees that wow this is what I thought we
[44:11] are not protected in any way against an
[44:17] invasion he says this and I went out by
[44:19] Night by the gate of the
[44:21] valley even before the dragon well and
[44:24] the dung port and viewed the walls of
[44:26] Jerusalem which were broken down and the
[44:28] gates thereof were consumed with
[44:30] fire then I went on to the gate of the
[44:33] fountain and to the king's pool but
[44:35] there was no place for the Beast that
[44:36] was that was under me to pass then when
[44:39] I up in the Night by the Brook and
[44:41] viewed all the wall and turned back and
[44:43] entered by the gate of the valley and so
[44:45] I returned and the rulers knew not
[44:48] whether I went or what I did neither had
[44:52] I as yet told the Jews nor the priests
[44:54] nor the Nobles nor the rulers nor the
[44:56] rest of the
[44:57] the rest that did the work then I said
[45:00] unto them ye see the distress that we
[45:02] are in how Jerusalem lith waste and the
[45:05] gates thereof are burned with fire come
[45:08] and let us build up the wall of
[45:10] Jerusalem that we be no more a reproach
[45:14] then as I told them of of the hand of my
[45:18] God which was upon which was good upon
[45:20] me as also the king's words that he had
[45:23] spoken unto me and they said let us rise
[45:27] up and
[45:28] build so they strengthen their hands for
[45:31] this good work I love that response
[45:35] let's go let's do it Nehemiah we are
[45:39] with you let's build this wall you can
[45:42] see the enthusiasm of the people and
[45:46] brother Aon that's what I feel like
[45:47] that's what we're missing in many times
[45:50] in this last agage is that enthusiasm to
[45:54] serve the Lord to build and to do
[45:57] because we're so caught up in many other
[46:00] things and and our minds are are always
[46:02] on they're on work or they're on
[46:04] entertainment or they're on whatever
[46:06] they are and there is work to do here
[46:09] and I love these these people's
[46:11] responses let's do it let's build this
[46:14] wall there is one age Revelation 2 and
[46:18] Revelation 3 these ages that we call the
[46:21] seven Church ages it starts in EP
[46:24] Ephesus and it ends in leoa there is one
[46:28] age that it commands be
[46:30] zealous and that is this age because
[46:33] brother Jonathan we're lacking the Zeal
[46:35] wow that we should have and this is the
[46:39] age that we are going to see the coming
[46:41] of Christ and you can see how the enemy
[46:44] has got in there and he's taken the Zeal
[46:47] away from the
[46:48] people but when sand ballot the horonite
[46:52] and tobiah the servant the ammonite and
[46:54] gam the Arabian heard it they laughed us
[46:57] to scorn and despised us and said what
[47:00] is this thing that you do will you rebel
[47:02] against the king now watch notice
[47:04] nehemiah's answer the king himself sent
[47:08] him to build the wall the King of Persia
[47:11] the king sent him but Nehemiah by faith
[47:14] he referred to a higher
[47:17] King than the King of Persia then
[47:20] answered I them and said unto them now
[47:23] remember these are
[47:25] Persians these are men subject to The
[47:28] King and I said unto them the god of
[47:31] Heaven he will prosper us therefore we
[47:35] his servants will arise and build but
[47:37] you have no portion nor right nor
[47:39] Memorial in Jerusalem so Nehemiah was
[47:42] firm and he called upon the Lord knowing
[47:44] that Jehovah is a greater King than
[47:48] anyone on Earth so we look at the faith
[47:51] that he had how many of us would have
[47:53] said no the king sent me here's my
[47:56] here's my letter
[47:57] here's my orders he didn't do that he
[48:01] said no God has sent us so in chapter 3
[48:06] they start building the wall now let's
[48:10] read chapter 3 verse
[48:13] one then eliasib the high priest rose up
[48:17] with his brother and the priest and they
[48:19] builded the Sheep gate and they
[48:21] Sanctified it and set up the doors of it
[48:24] even unto the Tower of Mia
[48:27] they Sanctified it unto the Tower of
[48:31] hanal
[48:32] Now watch how the people are working
[48:36] together here and I'll read just this
[48:37] next couple verses so you see you get a
[48:40] feeling of the rest of the chapter and
[48:42] next to and next unto him builded the
[48:46] men of Jericho and next to them builded
[48:51] zacher the son of emry but the fishgate
[48:54] did the Sons of Hassan build who who
[48:58] also laid the beams thereof and set up
[49:01] the doors thereof and the locks thereof
[49:03] and the bars thereof look at how people
[49:04] had different jobs here and next unto
[49:09] them repaired maroth the son of urah the
[49:13] son of Co and next unto
[49:17] them repaired mulam the son of bariah
[49:21] the son of mesha
[49:24] zabil and next un to them repa repaired
[49:29] zadok the son of Baya so it shows that
[49:31] each group and each person had a part in
[49:34] rebuilding the walls and they all work
[49:36] together in doing it I'm sure that many
[49:40] of them probably weren't as skilled as
[49:42] the other ones but they all yet they all
[49:44] had a burden to do this they all had a
[49:46] Zeal to do it and watch what they
[49:49] accomplished so in chapter 4 we see a
[49:51] lot of opposition and it starts to
[49:55] affect the moral of the people let's go
[49:58] to verse uh chter 4:1 but it came to
[50:01] pass that when sand ballot heard that we
[50:04] builded the wall he was wroth and took
[50:07] great indignation and mocked the Jews
[50:11] and he spake before his Brethren and the
[50:13] army of Samaria and said what do these
[50:16] Fe what do these feeble Jews will they
[50:19] fortify themselves will they sacrifice
[50:22] will they make an end in a day
[50:26] so he's saying will they finish it a day
[50:29] they must have been working really hard
[50:31] when he saw this happen and he was
[50:33] making fun of them saying Oh you're
[50:34] working really hard now you're going to
[50:35] finish the whole thing in a
[50:37] day will they revive the stones out of
[50:40] the heaps of rubbish which are burned
[50:43] now remember that word rubbish it comes
[50:46] to play a little
[50:48] later now tobah the ammonite was was by
[50:51] him and he said even that which they
[50:54] build if a fox go up he shall even break
[50:57] down their stone wall look at them just
[50:58] making fun of them saying they can't
[51:00] build anything right if just a little
[51:02] fox goes up there the Wall fall down
[51:04] here our God here oh Our God for we are
[51:10] despised and turn their reproach upon
[51:13] their own head and give them for a prey
[51:16] in the land of captivity look at what
[51:18] this man now is praying it's it's a bit
[51:21] of a harsh prayer it's he's saying Lord
[51:26] the thing that they're saying against us
[51:29] let it come back upon him and cover not
[51:32] their iniquity and let not their sin be
[51:34] blotted out from before thee for they
[51:36] provoke provoke thee to anger before the
[51:39] builders so built we the wall and all
[51:43] the wall was joined together unto the
[51:45] half thereof for the people had a mind
[51:48] to
[51:50] worken love that part they wanted to do
[51:53] something they and they weren't just
[51:55] talking a big talk
[51:57] they put they put the their life behind
[52:00] their words
[52:03] amen see how important it is brothers
[52:05] and sisters for the church to be in one
[52:08] Accord and have one objective we can do
[52:11] amazing things remember in Acts chapter
[52:14] 2 the people were all in one Accord what
[52:19] does that mean that mean they that means
[52:21] they had one purpose in all of this the
[52:26] enemy he sees the people working
[52:28] together and then he gets in there to
[52:30] cause problems and we'll see where these
[52:32] problems are right now but it came to
[52:34] pass that when sand ballot and tobia and
[52:36] the Arabians and the ammonites and the
[52:38] asites heard that the walls of Jerusalem
[52:41] were made up and that the breaches began
[52:43] to be stopped they were very wroth and
[52:45] they con conspired all of them together
[52:48] to come and to fight against Jerusalem
[52:51] and hinder it nevertheless we made our
[52:54] prayer unto God and set a watch against
[52:57] them day and night because of them so
[53:00] they prayed and they armed themselves
[53:02] and they were ready to go to battle
[53:04] against anyone that would hinder them so
[53:07] they set a guard half of them were armed
[53:10] with Spears and Shields and and and
[53:14] instruments of war and then the other
[53:16] half they were laying the bricks but
[53:19] even that half that was laying the
[53:20] bricks they had a sword on their side so
[53:24] these guys were ready to go
[53:27] anytime they were ready to go to battle
[53:29] but they just kept laying These
[53:32] Bricks but
[53:35] attitude is also very very important so
[53:38] the people started to lose confidence
[53:41] and they started to
[53:43] complain and Judah said the strength of
[53:47] the bearers of burden is decayed and
[53:50] there is much rubbish I wonder where he
[53:55] he got that
[53:57] remember they were saying that before so
[54:00] they were starting to influence these
[54:02] people and they started to repeat what
[54:05] they were hearing with the criticism so
[54:07] that we are not able to build the wall
[54:10] so the enemies planted these negative
[54:12] thoughts in the people's minds and they
[54:14] even said the same words so brothers and
[54:17] sisters how important are our
[54:20] words in our church the tson Tabernacle
[54:29] doesn't do any good to
[54:34] complain it doesn't do any good to talk
[54:37] behind the
[54:39] scenes all of
[54:41] us we've
[54:44] heard
[54:46] criticism you know we've
[54:48] heard as we're growing as a church as
[54:52] people are coming in we've baptized 60
[54:56] people in the past year many of those
[54:59] people have never even been to church
[55:03] before I know that on Wednesday night
[55:05] we're just a few in number these are the
[55:07] pillars in the church but on Sunday
[55:09] morning we see those people
[55:13] yes and then yet I hear
[55:17] criticism well look at these people look
[55:19] at the way they
[55:20] look look at the way they act that
[55:22] doesn't make sense for a Christian come
[55:24] on to say those things amen it makes
[55:27] sense for a Christian to have a burden
[55:29] for these
[55:31] people the
[55:32] Pharisees and even the Disciples of
[55:36] John said the same thing about Jesus did
[55:40] you know
[55:42] that they said look at Jesus he's
[55:44] hanging out with these people that are
[55:46] drinking he's hanging out with these
[55:48] Sinners they're saying what's what's the
[55:51] deal with all this so here's John's
[55:53] John's disciples John the Baptist his
[55:55] disciples are saying it the Pharisees
[55:57] are saying it they're saying why do you
[55:59] have all these worldly people in your
[56:00] church so you know what Jesus answered
[56:02] it came to Jesus he said this he said I
[56:06] desire Mercy amen and not sacrifice amen
[56:11] the Lord Jesus Christ answering these
[56:15] same people that were giving the same
[56:18] criticisms that we even hear
[56:23] today so negative attitude
[56:27] brothers and sisters be careful I know
[56:32] that there is a time for criticism but
[56:35] make sure the criticism comes to the
[56:37] right
[56:38] place that's why we have positions in
[56:40] the
[56:41] church make sure that we are hearing it
[56:45] and and you know it could be different
[56:47] things it could be pews versus chairs it
[56:50] could be the color of the walls do you
[56:52] like the
[56:55] pink in the fellowship
[56:58] hall I promise it's not going to be
[57:01] pink somebody somebody asked I said yeah
[57:03] we're just going to make all of that in
[57:05] Nursery out
[57:08] there but it C it brings people down it
[57:12] really does I understand that there's
[57:14] mistakes that are made sometime I
[57:16] understand that there is a time for
[57:18] criticism but make sure it comes to the
[57:20] right place and it's not just going out
[57:23] and causing problems let's skip to verse
[57:25] 14
[57:27] and I looked up and Rose up and said
[57:29] unto the Nobles and to the rulers and to
[57:31] the rest of the people be ye be not ye
[57:34] afraid of them remember the Lord which
[57:36] is great and terrible and fight for your
[57:40] brethren fight for each other fight for
[57:43] the people in the congregation the ones
[57:44] that you love Fight for them don't fight
[57:47] against them and your sons and your
[57:49] daughters and your wives and your houses
[57:51] and it came to pass when our enemies
[57:54] heard that it was known unto us
[57:56] and God had brought their counsel T not
[57:59] that we returned all of us to the wall
[58:02] every one of us to his work so this is a
[58:05] leader this Nehemiah he says listen he
[58:08] says understand what's going on here we
[58:10] are in this battle for each other not
[58:12] against each other don't let these
[58:14] outside people lay this this seat of
[58:18] discrepancy inside of you fight for each
[58:21] other love one another serve each other
[58:25] so again I said he said he says half
[58:27] them men with Spears and Shields and
[58:28] bows and the other half they're working
[58:31] on the wall but they still had swords on
[58:33] their side and the same thing with
[58:36] Israel today I talked about Israel on
[58:38] Sunday morning it's the same thing
[58:39] they've got the Iron Dome and they've
[58:41] got the iron shield and they've got F35
[58:45] and F-16 Fighters and they've got tanks
[58:47] and they've got all of these things that
[58:50] they are ready to go to battle
[58:52] man but they're still continuing on with
[58:55] their country right they're growing
[58:58] crops they're making software they're
[59:01] still working hard as a country to grow
[59:05] their country but they like their
[59:08] ancestors here they are ready to go to
[59:11] battle and it came to
[59:14] pass from that time forth that the half
[59:17] of my servants rought in the work and
[59:19] the other half of them held both Spears
[59:22] and Shields and bows and the harbingers
[59:25] and the rulers were behind all of the
[59:28] house of Judah so then we go to chapter
[59:33] five and the
[59:35] people the rulers they were charging a
[59:38] high people are
[59:41] people and you can't get out of it right
[59:44] I mean it's it it's
[59:49] just people are people that's that's the
[59:52] best way to say it they were charging
[59:55] High interest rates on loans and they
[59:57] were using this bad situation to extort
[1:00:00] money from their uh their their brethren
[1:00:05] in the
[1:00:09] church is it on okay they're brethren in
[1:00:13] the church so Nehemiah puts a stop to it
[1:00:17] he says brothers and sisters quit
[1:00:20] extorting money quit using this
[1:00:24] situation to get money out of your
[1:00:26] brothers and sisters we are in this as I
[1:00:28] said in this battle together then
[1:00:30] chapter six the enemy tries to
[1:00:34] multiply the times he tries I'm sorry
[1:00:38] the enemy tries to enti
[1:00:43] Nehemiah out of the
[1:00:46] Camp starts sending him letters hey why
[1:00:48] don't you come out here and talk to us
[1:00:51] why don't you come outside the walls and
[1:00:53] why don't you why don't we discuss all
[1:00:55] this why don't you answer nehemiah's
[1:00:58] answer was you know I don't have time
[1:00:59] for
[1:01:01] you I'm
[1:01:03] I'm I'm busy I'm doing my work and I
[1:01:07] don't have time for your
[1:01:10] criticism I've answered the same
[1:01:13] way quite a few times I I just you're
[1:01:18] not doing this you're not preaching like
[1:01:19] you should you're not you're not and I'm
[1:01:21] not talking about people in this
[1:01:22] congregation I'm talking about the
[1:01:23] people from
[1:01:24] outside you know what I don't have time
[1:01:27] for you I'm busy with these people
[1:01:31] building these
[1:01:32] walls building this Temple serving the
[1:01:37] people chapter six as I said they they
[1:01:40] try to entice him out he doesn't do it
[1:01:42] then in chapter I mean in verse 15 he
[1:01:45] says this so the wall was finished in 20
[1:01:50] in the 205th day of the month of elu in
[1:01:53] 52 days that's 2 and a half
[1:01:58] miles of a wall with
[1:02:02] bricks built up that could protect the
[1:02:06] city I'm building a house right
[1:02:11] now 52 days it took him to build this
[1:02:14] wall around the city so I got the
[1:02:17] estimate from my contractor and I have
[1:02:19] to I have to have this wall built my
[1:02:23] backyard and at the rate
[1:02:26] that my contractor is building the wall
[1:02:29] it would take
[1:02:31] 216
[1:02:33] years for my contractor to build the
[1:02:36] wall around
[1:02:38] Jerusalem Nehemiah did it in less than
[1:02:41] two
[1:02:42] months not
[1:02:47] complaining 216 years it would take to
[1:02:51] build to build this this wall around
[1:02:53] Jerusalem if it was if it was the
[1:02:55] contractor that I heard not Michael not
[1:02:57] the guy that comes to church is it's the
[1:02:59] other guy it really isn't him Michael if
[1:03:02] you're streaming in I'm not talking
[1:03:03] about you brother and and it came to
[1:03:05] pass that when all our enemies heard
[1:03:08] thereof and all the Heathen that were
[1:03:11] about us saw these things they were they
[1:03:14] were much cast down in their own eyes
[1:03:16] for they perceived that this work was
[1:03:18] rought of our God I'll bet they
[1:03:21] were I'll bet they were amazed at that
[1:03:24] so in chapter S
[1:03:26] it list the people who returned from
[1:03:27] Persia to Jerusalem in all there were
[1:03:29] about 50,000 people
[1:03:32] 42,000 um of uh of of the Jews and then
[1:03:36] about seven or 8,000 of their servants
[1:03:40] now chapter 8 as I said
[1:03:43] before this book of
[1:03:46] Nehemiah is most certainly one of my
[1:03:49] favorite books in the Old
[1:03:51] Testament and I think that Nehemiah
[1:03:54] chapter 8 could be my favorite chapter
[1:03:59] in the entire Old
[1:04:02] Testament the first seven chapters were
[1:04:05] about building the wall they finished
[1:04:07] the
[1:04:08] wall and then now it's time brothers and
[1:04:12] sisters for
[1:04:14] Revival and this is the start of the
[1:04:17] Revival right here in Nehemiah chapter 8
[1:04:21] now
[1:04:22] Ezra he we have he hasn't been mentioned
[1:04:24] yet he's back on the scene now remember
[1:04:27] I said that Ezra was there for 14 years
[1:04:30] about before um Nehemiah arrives now he
[1:04:33] comes back Ezra is the minister Ezra is
[1:04:36] the Scribe Nehemiah is the
[1:04:39] governor and now
[1:04:41] Ezra takes the
[1:04:43] pulpit and what does he do he brings the
[1:04:47] people back to the
[1:04:52] word we've been going through our Bible
[1:04:54] study the people always do the same
[1:04:56] thing they stray from God's word God
[1:04:59] sends a deliverer and they come back and
[1:05:01] every
[1:05:04] Revival starts with people coming back
[1:05:08] to the word remember in judges they
[1:05:10] would come back to the word and then God
[1:05:13] would send a blessing Josiah King Josiah
[1:05:16] remember we were talking about that in 2
[1:05:17] Chronicles where Josiah they they find
[1:05:20] the Bible in the church never reading
[1:05:23] it doing something else
[1:05:27] but they get back to the word and then
[1:05:32] God sends a blessing same thing happened
[1:05:34] with John Wickliffe way back when he's
[1:05:37] he takes the Latin Vulgate they didn't
[1:05:39] have the original the original Bible he
[1:05:42] translates this into the into the common
[1:05:45] people's language then later on the
[1:05:47] Protestant Revival we see Martin Luther
[1:05:49] and and William tendale they they take
[1:05:53] these these original manuscripts and
[1:05:56] they translate them into German and into
[1:05:58] English tendale into English Luther into
[1:06:01] German and then we see the Protestant
[1:06:03] Revival come it's always get the people
[1:06:06] back to the word we leave the word and
[1:06:09] if we can just get back to the
[1:06:12] Bible this book has everything that we
[1:06:17] need and it brings Revival if we can
[1:06:20] just get back to
[1:06:23] this it's happened over and over again
[1:06:26] ISU the Street
[1:06:28] Revival the people read in the book of
[1:06:30] Acts they said that these tongues many
[1:06:33] times his tongues comes from receiving
[1:06:35] the Holy Spirit they started praying
[1:06:38] Lord we are not where we should be God
[1:06:40] sends a Revival in isua Street 1906
[1:06:44] changes the
[1:06:46] world brother brandham
[1:06:49] comes he says listen you've left the
[1:06:51] word get back to this original word
[1:06:54] Divine Healing he says come back to it
[1:06:57] if the Bible says it it means it Jesus
[1:07:01] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:07:04] forever get back to the word and get
[1:07:06] away from your weird
[1:07:10] denominations Lord sent a
[1:07:13] Revival we need to get back to the word
[1:07:19] back to this
[1:07:22] book over and over again we see it and
[1:07:27] it's just that
[1:07:28] simple turn the
[1:07:30] heart of the
[1:07:32] children back to that of the fathers
[1:07:36] brother ramam said back to the apostolic
[1:07:39] fathers the ones that believe the word
[1:07:41] the word says
[1:07:43] it and they believe
[1:07:47] it chapter
[1:07:50] 8 verse
[1:07:53] one and all the people ga GED themselves
[1:07:56] together as one
[1:07:57] man as I said before the unity of the
[1:08:02] people into the street that was before
[1:08:05] the Watergate and they spake unto Ezra
[1:08:07] The Scribe to bring the book of the law
[1:08:10] of Moses which the Lord had commanded to
[1:08:14] Israel read the
[1:08:18] Bible and Ezra the priest brought the
[1:08:21] law before the congregation both of men
[1:08:23] and women and all that could hear with
[1:08:27] understanding upon the first day of the
[1:08:28] seventh month and he read therein before
[1:08:31] the street that was before the Watergate
[1:08:34] from the morning until
[1:08:37] midday before the men and the women and
[1:08:40] those that could understand and the ears
[1:08:42] of all the people were attentive unto
[1:08:45] the book of the
[1:08:47] law this was a long service and he was
[1:08:51] just up there reading the
[1:08:54] Bible and and they weren't falling
[1:08:56] asleep they loved the word and they were
[1:08:59] just digesting it and they were
[1:09:01] listening to it from morning until
[1:09:04] midday Ezra
[1:09:07] reading the word and Ezra The Scribe
[1:09:11] stood up on the pulpit of wood which
[1:09:12] they had made for the purpose and beside
[1:09:14] him stood maiah and Shima and anayah and
[1:09:20] UAH and
[1:09:22] hilaya and maasa um
[1:09:26] Masai on his right hand and on his left
[1:09:29] hand
[1:09:30] padah and
[1:09:31] mishel and malayah and hasham and has
[1:09:37] badana and Zachariah and mulam and Ezra
[1:09:41] open the book in the sight of the people
[1:09:43] for he was above all the people when he
[1:09:45] opened it he was up here and the people
[1:09:47] were were down there they had made him
[1:09:49] this pulpit and he opened the book and
[1:09:52] all the people stood
[1:09:54] up you didn't have to tell them right
[1:09:57] they had respect for this word that's
[1:10:01] why we see I believe that's why we see
[1:10:04] we see
[1:10:06] sometimes that the people will stand
[1:10:09] maybe at the beginning of
[1:10:11] service in reverence of reading the
[1:10:17] Bible look at the reverence it's just
[1:10:19] the reverence that they had in this
[1:10:22] chapter is just so beautiful
[1:10:26] and Ezra blessed the Lord the great God
[1:10:31] and all the people answered amen amen
[1:10:34] with lifting up their
[1:10:35] hands so we can say amen and we can lift
[1:10:39] up our hands in
[1:10:40] church
[1:10:42] amen we don't have to be quiet it's in
[1:10:45] the Bible and it gets better also Joshua
[1:10:49] and
[1:10:50] bayai and sheriah and Jamon and akub and
[1:10:54] shabath
[1:10:56] and
[1:10:57] hodah and meiah and Kida and Azariah and
[1:11:03] jbad and
[1:11:05] Hannan and
[1:11:07] pah and the
[1:11:09] Levites caused the people to understand
[1:11:12] the law and the people stood in their
[1:11:14] place so these ministers they helped the
[1:11:16] people understand the word they helped
[1:11:18] them understand
[1:11:21] Deuteronomy and
[1:11:23] Leviticus and numbers exactly brothers
[1:11:26] and sisters exactly what we are trying
[1:11:29] to do in our Wednesday night bible
[1:11:33] study so they read in the book in the
[1:11:36] law of God distinctly and gave the sense
[1:11:39] and caused them to understand the
[1:11:41] reading and
[1:11:44] Nehemiah which is the
[1:11:47] tatha and Ezra the priest The Scribe and
[1:11:52] the Levites that taught the people said
[1:11:54] unto all the people this day is Holy
[1:11:56] unto the Lord your God moreour not nor
[1:11:58] weep for all the people wept when they
[1:12:00] heard the words of the law they were
[1:12:02] just overwhelmed brother Josiah it was
[1:12:05] they were just listening to this and
[1:12:06] they just started weeping and here's the
[1:12:08] brothers are like no no don't weep this
[1:12:11] is a great day this is a glorious day
[1:12:15] we're we're hearing this word we're
[1:12:18] reading the Bible this is
[1:12:21] awesome praise the Lord
[1:12:26] then he said unto them go your way eat
[1:12:28] the fat and drink the sweet and send
[1:12:30] portions unto them for whom nothing is
[1:12:32] prepared for this day is Holy unto our
[1:12:35] Lord neither be ye sarry for the joy of
[1:12:37] the Lord is your strength so the Levites
[1:12:40] stealed all the people saying hold your
[1:12:43] peace for the day is Holy neither be ye
[1:12:47] grieved and all the people went their
[1:12:49] way to eat and to drink and to send
[1:12:51] portions and to make a great mirth
[1:12:53] because they had understood the words
[1:12:55] that were declared of them he said go
[1:12:58] home and relax we're going to cancel
[1:13:00] Sunday evening
[1:13:04] service
[1:13:06] enjoy each other
[1:13:09] eat and be happy because the word has
[1:13:13] been read to you this
[1:13:15] day and on the second day we're gathered
[1:13:19] together the chief of the fathers of all
[1:13:21] the people the priests and the Levites
[1:13:23] unto Ezra The Scribe even to understand
[1:13:26] the words of the law and they found
[1:13:28] written in the law which the Lord had
[1:13:30] commanded by Moses that the children of
[1:13:33] Israel should dwell in booths in the
[1:13:35] Feast of the seventh month I believe
[1:13:37] brother L this is the Feast of
[1:13:40] Tabernacles and they and that they
[1:13:43] should publish and Proclaim in all the
[1:13:44] cities and in Jerusalem saying go forth
[1:13:46] under the mount and fetch Olive branches
[1:13:49] and pine branches and Myrtle branches
[1:13:51] and palm branches and the branches of
[1:13:53] thick trees to make booths as as it is
[1:13:56] written so the people went forth and
[1:13:58] brought them and made themselves booths
[1:14:01] booths and Tabernacles are the same word
[1:14:04] and made themselves
[1:14:07] booths everyone upon the roof of his
[1:14:09] house and in their courts and in the and
[1:14:13] in the courts of the house of God and in
[1:14:14] the street of the Watergate and in the
[1:14:16] streets of the Gate of Ephraim and all
[1:14:19] the congregation of them that were come
[1:14:21] again out of the Captivity made booths
[1:14:24] and they under the booth for since the
[1:14:27] days of jeshua the son of nun unto that
[1:14:29] day had not the children of Israel done
[1:14:32] so and there was a very great gladness
[1:14:35] they started again celebrating this
[1:14:38] Feast of
[1:14:40] Tabernacles they were honoring the
[1:14:43] Lord by doing his word
[1:14:47] amen also Day by Day from the first day
[1:14:51] until the last he read the book of The
[1:14:53] Law of God and they they kept the feast
[1:14:56] seven days and on the eighth day was a
[1:14:58] solemn assembly according unto the
[1:15:01] manner what a glorious day this was in
[1:15:05] Jerusalem the people heard the word and
[1:15:08] they acted on the word and they thanked
[1:15:10] him for their Church they thanked him
[1:15:12] for their protection they thanked him
[1:15:14] through obeying his word then in chapter
[1:15:18] nine the Levites consecrate themselves
[1:15:21] they pray and they give a beautiful
[1:15:23] history from Abraham
[1:15:25] to that day in the end of chapter N9
[1:15:28] they make a covenant to renew their vows
[1:15:31] to the
[1:15:32] Lord and then in chapter 10 it lists who
[1:15:36] signed that
[1:15:39] Covenant
[1:15:40] now there was a
[1:15:43] problem there weren't enough people
[1:15:45] living in the city of Jerusalem they had
[1:15:46] this beautiful Temple they had this be
[1:15:48] this beautiful wall around the city but
[1:15:51] they didn't have enough people living in
[1:15:52] the city so in chapter 11 they take a
[1:15:57] tenth of every group of those people
[1:16:01] that were living outside of Jerusalem
[1:16:04] and they relocate to live in the
[1:16:09] city then in chapter 12 it lists all the
[1:16:13] Levites and it lists their celebration
[1:16:15] let's let's read verse
[1:16:18] 27 and at the dedication of the wall of
[1:16:20] Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of
[1:16:22] all their places to bring them to jerus
[1:16:24] Jerusalem to keep the dedication with
[1:16:26] gladness both with Thanksgiving and with
[1:16:29] singing with symbols and sultes and with
[1:16:31] Harps and the sons of the singers gather
[1:16:34] gathered themselves together both out of
[1:16:36] the plain of the country round about
[1:16:38] Jerusalem and from The
[1:16:41] Villages of
[1:16:43] npoy also from the house of gilgal and
[1:16:47] out of all the F fields of giba and
[1:16:50] asmath for the singers had builded them
[1:16:53] Villages round about Jerusalem look how
[1:16:56] important brothers and sisters our
[1:16:58] musicians
[1:17:00] are the chapter goes on and on talking
[1:17:04] about the musicians and the singers and
[1:17:07] the worshippers it's pretty obvious in
[1:17:10] reading this chapter how important our
[1:17:14] worship service is we call them some
[1:17:17] people some Churches we call him a song
[1:17:19] leader or we call it a song service but
[1:17:21] no it's a worship leader it's a worship
[1:17:25] service it's a worship team that is what
[1:17:27] this is for is worship and this chapter
[1:17:31] is amazing how much emphasis it puts on
[1:17:35] worship yes sir amen verse 30 now let's
[1:17:39] let's skip to verse
[1:17:41] 43 for time sake also that day they
[1:17:45] offered great sacrifices and rejoiced
[1:17:48] for God had made them Rejoice with great
[1:17:50] joy the wives also and the children
[1:17:53] rejoiced so that the joy of Jerusalem
[1:17:56] Was Heard even a far
[1:17:59] off wow the joy was heard it wasn't just
[1:18:04] the
[1:18:06] singing it was a combination of it all
[1:18:10] it was the singing it was the
[1:18:12] instruments it was the shouts of amen
[1:18:14] and the shouts of Hallelujah brothers
[1:18:17] and sisters many we're too
[1:18:20] quiet I'm not saying that you have to be
[1:18:24] jump in the pews as some of the brothers
[1:18:27] say but you can say
[1:18:30] Amen we can say hallelujah amen we can
[1:18:34] shout out so that at least maybe the
[1:18:36] people walking along the sidewalk
[1:18:38] outside can hear the joy that's
[1:18:42] inside let's go to verse
[1:18:46] 47 and all Israel in the days of
[1:18:50] zerubabel and in and in the days of
[1:18:52] Nehemiah gave the portions of the
[1:18:54] singers and the porters every day his
[1:18:57] portion and they Sanctified holy things
[1:19:00] unto the Levites and the Levites
[1:19:03] Sanctified them unto the children of
[1:19:06] Aaron an entire chapter devoted to
[1:19:11] worship
[1:19:13] beautiful musicians would come and we'll
[1:19:17] close
[1:19:19] um this is the
[1:19:21] Bible the Bible describes human
[1:19:25] nature and the the Bible describes the
[1:19:28] nature of
[1:19:30] God God's longsuffering with his
[1:19:32] children he pours out his Spirit when
[1:19:35] his children follow his word and he
[1:19:37] allows his children to
[1:19:40] suffer when we get away from his word
[1:19:44] and suffering is just to bring us back
[1:19:47] so Nehemiah he goes back to Persia as he
[1:19:51] had promised the king and then when he
[1:19:54] returns
[1:19:56] brothers and sisters he
[1:19:58] sees at the
[1:20:00] people as with almost every book that
[1:20:03] I've read almost every study that we've
[1:20:06] done almost every Wednesday night bible
[1:20:08] service that we've conducted we see the
[1:20:11] same thing over and over again and the
[1:20:14] book of
[1:20:16] Nehemiah is just basically part for the
[1:20:19] course it's the same thing as every
[1:20:22] other book
[1:20:24] he goes back to Persia as he promised
[1:20:26] the king then when he returns he sees
[1:20:28] that Israel had fallen into
[1:20:31] sin the three big sins that he names are
[1:20:34] the people not financially supporting
[1:20:36] the
[1:20:37] ministry dishonoring the Sabbath and
[1:20:41] then also marrying outside their
[1:20:44] faith
[1:20:47] and let's go to verse six and I'll I'll
[1:20:50] we'll close with
[1:20:52] this but in all the time was I
[1:20:56] not was not I at Jerusalem for in two
[1:20:59] and the 30th year of AR Xerxes King of
[1:21:02] Babylon came I under the king and after
[1:21:04] certain days obtained I leave of the
[1:21:06] king so now he's going to go
[1:21:08] back and I came to Jerusalem and
[1:21:11] understood of the evil that eliab did
[1:21:15] for toaya in preparing him a chamber in
[1:21:17] the courts of the house of God and it
[1:21:19] grieved me sore therefore I cast forth
[1:21:23] all of the household stuff to deah out
[1:21:25] of the chamber then I commanded and they
[1:21:27] cleansed the chambers and there brought
[1:21:29] I again vessels of the house of God with
[1:21:31] meat offering and the frankincense and I
[1:21:33] perceived that the portion of the
[1:21:35] Levites had not been given them for the
[1:21:38] Levites and the singers that did the
[1:21:40] work were fled everyone to his
[1:21:42] field then I cont then contended I with
[1:21:45] the rulers and said why is the house of
[1:21:47] God Forsaken and I gathered them
[1:21:49] together and set them in their place
[1:21:51] verse 15 and I saw then those days I saw
[1:21:55] saw I in Judah some treading the wine
[1:21:58] press on the Sabbath talks about the
[1:22:01] Sabbath and sending there and then in
[1:22:04] verse 19 he says and it came to pass
[1:22:06] when the Gates of Jerusalem began to be
[1:22:09] dark before the Sabbath I commanded that
[1:22:11] the gates should be shut the people
[1:22:13] started getting lack in their worship
[1:22:16] we're going to see that when we get to
[1:22:18] the Book of Malachi which was written at
[1:22:20] about the same time as
[1:22:22] this and he goes on
[1:22:25] he tells of the
[1:22:26] sins of the
[1:22:28] people and in verse 26 and he's speaking
[1:22:33] of when when the young men were were
[1:22:36] marrying these girls that weren't
[1:22:39] Christians and when the young women were
[1:22:41] doing the same he says did not Solomon
[1:22:45] king of Israel sin by these things yet
[1:22:47] among many nations was there no King
[1:22:50] like him who was beloved of his God and
[1:22:54] God made him King over all Israel
[1:22:56] nevertheless even him did outlandish
[1:22:59] women caused to
[1:23:02] sin and then in verse 31 this is
[1:23:07] something that he says
[1:23:09] often he says remember me oh my God for
[1:23:15] good so thus we
[1:23:17] have the
[1:23:20] book of
[1:23:22] Nehemiah as I said it's when they when
[1:23:25] the
[1:23:27] um Israelites came out of captivity they
[1:23:31] settled in the land zerubabel in the
[1:23:34] line of the
[1:23:35] king he had a burden to bring the people
[1:23:38] out king cus allowed him to go Ezra came
[1:23:44] Ezra rebuilt the temple and this man
[1:23:46] Nehemiah was
[1:23:49] tasked with building the wall around
[1:23:52] Jerusalem it's one of the as far as the
[1:23:55] chronology of the Bible it's one of the
[1:23:57] last books in the Bible I know that we
[1:24:01] have a lot to go until the end of
[1:24:02] Malachi but this was written some I
[1:24:05] don't know 440 450 years before the Lord
[1:24:09] Jesus came so it's it's right at one of
[1:24:13] the last books that were written in the
[1:24:16] Bible brother
