does there is no one else there is no one else like you that is so true those words are accurate they're spot on they are precise thank you so much good evening thank you and Welcome to our Wednesday night bible study I'm excited tonight just a little reminder I've I've been printing out these little Guides of the scriptures and some of the images that we do and they're in the back there from uh two weeks ago and from last week as well as from tonight so if you want one as a little reminder or something as you go there they're in the back and there's no charge so we're investigating as you know the life of Joseph and some of the many lessons that it holds for us but before we start I need to apologize I made a statement last time I was showing a slide of a 4,000 year old model of a Greenery and I made a comment about government workers a sort of a disparaging statement I was really thinking of workplace structure but either way the comment was inappropriate and potentially offensive so I am sorry and I I mean that to whom those I may have offended please forgive me it was not my intent as we resume our study let's join together in prayer Lord Jesus it's it's an awesome responsibility we just sang Lord about you gave your life blood you came down from heaven you made a way for each of us and each person that standing that I'm facing this evening and that's facing me has been purchased by your blood they are a part of you and Lord it is it's not something to be taken lightly Lord I pray that this evening Lord that you would guard my lips guard the ears of everyone that hears Lord anyone that's streaming or may see at some future time Lord that nothing be said that offensive nothing be said Lord that that it's okay if it offends the devil but Lord we don't want to offend your people we don't want to offend you so Lord I just pray this evening Lord that you'd help us as we open this story and continue in in in Joseph Lord these little these little grains of sand that you left Lord that that that at some future time we could look back and we could see your hand we can know that you are truly the same yesterday and today and will be forever Lord we commit ourselves once more into your hands thank you forgive us where we fall short forgive us of our sin Lord our shortcomings and help us to draw closer to you to one another and live a life that's pleasing to you we thank you in Jesus precious name amen last time we saw that Joseph was sold into slavery in Piper's house after some years proving his ability and integrity potier had Advanced Joseph to become his chief operating officer he was then serving in Piper's house Piper's wife had been actively trying to seduce him she'd set a trap for him and as he escaped she managed to rip off his Kilt potier came home from work she confronted him with a tale about Joseph trying to force himself on her it's a lie of course as we demonstrated last time with that as background let's read our opening verses for this evening please turn to Romans chapter 8 I wonder if Paul was thinking of Joseph when he penned this Paul wrote we know we don't guess there's no doubt here we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them that are called according to his purpose purpose he might have been looking back and thinking Joseph hang on brother hang on it's working together for good because it's clear that you love God and it's clear that you are called Joseph was not in a happy place let's go to Genesis chapter 39 just before we're seated just a review to pick up where we were and Mrs P spake unto potier according to these word saying the Hebrew servant which I brought unto us it came in unto me to mock me what happened it's all your fault biper you brought this slave in our house and made him your personal servant look what he did when he saw his chest he came on to me that nasty filthy Hebrew it came to pass as I screamed for help he left his garment with me and out of the house and it came to pass when Joseph's Master heard the words of his wife which he spake unto him saying after this matter did th servant to me that his wrath was kindled and Joseph Master potier took him and please be seated okay what's pfer going to do how's Joseph going to explain things can he avoid execution the undoubted result of a slave attacking the wife of a high Egyptian official look again at verse 19 Piper's wrath was kindled he's burning with anger his wrath is ignited and Joseph Master took him and put him in the prison a place where the king's prisoners what does that mean King's prisoners were bound or confined there's so much going on in just these two verses first potier didn't execute Joseph as the captain of the Guard he's also the chief executioner in ancient times people were more often executed or beaten or or maimed than imprisoned cost money to run a prison it costs nothing to execute you you probably notice when we went through Leviticus numbers and Deuteronomy the punishments for breaking the law were fines or beatings or execution there's no passage that says if you do so and so then incarcerate this person for X number of days weeks or months and then turn them loose that's not how it worked the King's prisoners were those who had offended Pharaoh the king in some way they'd usually be fairly high ranking people Pharaoh was being careful to not execute them until he was satisfied that they were guilty of something more than displeasing him in some minor way and this would give time for potier or his people to investigate the matter report back or or allow Pharaoh's temper to cool off and find some face safe giving way to release or reinstate the detainee later in the Bible we begin to see prisons literally captive houses in other and later cultures such as the Philistines During the period of the judges some 500 to 900 years after Joseph but this prison this prison is unique in all the Bible the adjective to describe it is called the round house it's the only prison or even building in the Bible that's described this way and the description is consistent whenever this prison is mentioned it's always called The Roundhouse and it's the only one that's ever called The Roundhouse and that particular adjective round that particular Hebrew word is used in the entire Bible and only one other instance it's in the Song of Songs when Solomon is describing his Lover's belly button seriously so the particular use the peculiar use of this particular Hebrew word describing round tells us it was essentially a circular pit it may have been under pifer's house based on a later verse telling us the prison was in his house so under his house are just nearby to prevent escape and make it secure roundhouse is most likely in the form of a pit an underground Silo we'll see another clue confirming this perspective in in chapter 40 uh this is a photo I took of an area of Christian catacombs in Alexandria Egypt they date to the first century well after Joseph's time it's not a prison and it's from a later era but you get the idea and by the way in the window on the right you can see my sweetie speaking to Joseph not the biblical J Joseph but our guide in this part of Egypt who was a Christian gentleman named Joseph and how do you know a Christian in Egypt when they're a young child rather than baptizing them I don't know if the if that Orthodox Church does or not but there's a tattoo in the shape of a very particular kind of cross that is put on the child when they're very young and as you go through life you're marked as a Christian Joseph was a Christian well back to Jacob's Joseph from a pit to slavery to coo and back to a pit why would Piper not simply execute him anyone have an idea because he knows Joseph he's observed him for years he knows his Integrity he knows Joseph is Innocent but he's sent to prison he's not executed he's not beaten he's not tortured he's not sold to somebody else he's confined but given the run of the prison just like he was pifer's coo in his Palace he quickly becomes the prison's Chief Operating Officer another reason potier knows his wife and knows she's guilty oh are you sure he attacked you yes of course how could you even ask such a thing well I've investigated a lot of sexual assault cases uh you see this tear Joseph would not have worn a torn Kilt to work yet this Kilt is torn indicating it was violently removed and even if not torn the Garment is usually stripped off from the victim not the perpetrator of the attack but she's effectively pardoned why she's likely the daughter of an influential person in Pharaoh's Court we'll see that Pharaoh will present a wife to Joseph it's a daughter of an important priest if potier punishes Mrs P it might offend some very powerful people it it might even reflect poorly on the Judgment of pharaoh if he was involved in matchmaking it all on this so Piper is burning with anger towards Mrs P not towards Joseph and perhaps to his own predicament and frustration if he were burning with anger at Joseph he would have executed him he's replaceable he's a Hebrew slave see or not Joseph is a foreigner and he's a Hebrew we'll see the significance of that later but neither can he ignore what happened so he saves face by punishing Joseph in effect putting him in uh a protective custody his regard for Joseph is clear because he's put in the place where the king's prisoners were confined and did you notice how we got into this pit in chapter 37 his brothers stripped him of His Garment and his authority confined him in a pit a sister that became his prison once again he is stripped of His Garment and his authority and confined in a pit designed to be a prison deja vu all over again well let's read the final verse of chapter 39 Joseph's Master Piper took him put him into the prison a place where the king's prisoners were bound not tied up but confined and he was there in the prison but the Lord was with Joseph the Lord showed him Mercy the lord gave him favor in the sight of The Keeper of the prison the the the warden another one of Piper's men remember we read in Psalm 105 the Lord had sent Joseph to Egypt for a reason and The Keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison and whatsoever they did there he was the doer of it the keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand because the Lord was with Joseph and that which he did the Lord made it to prosper here in just three verses we're told three times that the Lord was with Joseph and the Lord made him successful remember in chapter 37 the Lord isn't mentioned once yet we saw his s chapter 39 started with Joseph being demoted from a favorite son to a slave it ends with him being demoted from a successful slave to a prisoner and back into a pit the first pit in Dothan he was held until just the right moment when the ishmaelites came by and this pit you'll see he'll also be held until just the right moment I think the Lord's influence in chapter 39 is emphasized because from our human perspective Joseph is being mistreated continually suffering yet really it is the Lord that is guiding it all and as we'll see in the best possible way for the circumstances and culture of that time and place look at the parallels in this chapter how it begins and ends uh the Lord was with Joseph and showed him Mery that's verse 21 the end of the chapter but the beginning of the chapter the Lord was with Joseph he was a prosperous man he was in the house of his master the Egyptian gave him favor in the sight of The Keeper of the prison Joseph found Grace in Piper's sight and served him The Keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison potier all that he had he put into his hand whatsoever they did there he was the doer of it he made him overseer over his house The Keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand Piper he left all that he had in Joseph's hand why because the Lord was with him and that which he did the Lord made it to prosper and earlier his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand the chapter begins and ends the same way I I wonder Isaiah knew this story Isaiah read these scriptures I wonder if he was meditating on this when he wrote in Isaiah 559 as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts amen with Joseph now unfairly incarcerated we move on to chapter 40 Joseph has been in prison for a while long enough to advance in responsibility and have the entire prison running smoothly for its VIP detainees he's likely been there close to a year don't really know but he spent perhaps a decade in service to potier until Mrs P took his Kilt regardless of how the time is divided Joseph has been in Egypt for 11 years he was taken at age 17 he is now 28 years old Senor threat 2 has been the Pharaoh on the throne for nine or 10 years Genesis 40 verse one it came to pass after these things that the butler most translations use the term cupbearer of the king of Egypt and his Baker had offended their lord king of Egypt we don't know what the offense is we can surmise something here Pharaoh was wroth he was angry angry against these two of his officers against the chief of the Butlers and the chief of the Bakers these are senior officials in the Royal household the butler would taste every drink before handing it to Pharaoh which also put him in a position to poison the king similarly the baker provided food for the king and likewise would be in a position to poison him can't be too careful it's likely perhaps somehow now that Pharaoh became suspicious of these two men they offended him in some way maybe he became aware of a rumor that there's a plot to kill him by poisoning so off to detention a royal timeout until the matter can be investigated oh potier is probably going to be involved after all men you can trust with your life are hard to replace and Pharaoh put them the Butler and the baker in ward in detention in the what House of whom the captain of the Guard potier entered the prison the place where Joseph was bound this prison is associated with his house it's in the house or probably under the house these guys are are bound but it doesn't mean they're tied up it simply means that they're incarcerated the The Roundhouse prison was on PO ofer's estate possibly a basement or sub basement of his Palace the text is clearer the prison was in his house and the captain of the Guard potier charged Joseph with them he assigned them to Joseph and he served them he became their attendant notice it's not the keeper of the prison that ensured Joseph looked after these two it was potterer himself and they continued a season in Ward long enough for the investigation whatever it was that offended phoh to be completed and they Dreamed a Dream both of them each man his dream in one night and in the same night each man according to the interpretation of his dream the the Butler and the baker of the king of Egypt which were Bound in the prison and Joseph came in unto them in the morning and looked upon them and behold they were sad more so than than normal and he asked Pharaoh's officers the the the cup Bearer and the baker that were were with him in the ward of his Lord's Piper's house saying wherefore look you so sadly today cheer up guys I'm responsible for looking after you I don't want you desponded if there's anything I can do to help apart from being confined here for a while can't do anything about that but but what's the matter why such long faces and they said unto him we have each Dreamed a Dream vivid enough to remember it in detail after waking up this morning and there's no interpreter of it in Egypt at that time there was a specific group of people whose job it was to interpret dreams they were part of the Royal Court we'll see this they had special manuals that they used for this purpose dreams were often considered Ed Omens Communications from the spirit world these men were familiar with the court and how all of this worked they had no access to an official interpreter of dreams and being in prison they became even more Melancholy than usual Joseph said unto them do not interpretations belong to God tell me your dreams the chief Butler told his dream to Joseph and said to him in my dream Behold a Vine was before me and in the vine were three branches and it was though it budded and her Blossom shot forth and the clusters of brought forth ripe grapes and and Pharaoh's cup was in my hand and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand and Joseph said oh you're going to love it this is the interpretation of this the three branches represent three days within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head from here and restore you into your place in the Royal Court you shall deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand after the former manner when when you were his Butler but think on me when it should be well with thee show kindness I pray thee unto me make mention of me unto Pho and and bring me out of this house for indeed I was stolen I did nothing wrong I wasn't being punished for some crime I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews and here in in Egypt and in Piper's house also I've done nothing they should put me into this dungeon not just prison dungeon again speaking of it being an underground location the Hebrew word translated dungeon here literally means boore as in as in a pit or are you ready a sistern in fact it's the identical word used in chapter 37 translated his pit where Joseph was briefly imprisoned by his brothers Joseph has come full circle from a pit and Dothan to a pit in Egypt and his appeal to the cup Bearer is also showing Joseph's growing sense of Despair ever getting out of his situation pfer is never going to let me out of here but but maybe maybe the Lord worked it out for this guy to come here and and he'll be my ticket out and it will turn out that that's exactly what happened and will happen just not in the way he probably imagined when the chief Baker saw that the interpretation was good notice he he waited he hesitated he he didn't go first why maybe no particular reason or maybe he knew the palace Intrigue that put them both there was true maybe he was guilty in some sort of plot to poison Pharaoh we don't know but when he saw the interpretation was good he said unto Joseph I also was in my my dream and behold I had three white baskets on my head and in the uppermost basket there was all manner of Bak Meats for pharaoh and the birds did eat them out of the basket on my head and Joseph perhaps after a pause quietly with compassion sadness answered and said this is the interpretation of your dream the three baskets are are three days and the baker's thinking oh just like the Butlers so far so good I'm gonna get away with this yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee oops not so good and shall hang thee on a tree literally impale you on a wooden pole and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee oh very bad the butler is hoping Joseph is correct the baker not so much it came to pass on the third day which was Pharaoh's birthday that Pharaoh made a feast unto all his servants and he lifted up the head of the chief Butler and the chief Baker among his servants this phrase lifted up in Hebrew occurs very often so he brought them out of prison he probably pointed the mountain made a speech you know there was a a plot to poison me He restored the chief Butler unto his Butlers ship again he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand he was innocent but he hanged impaled the chief Butler he was guilty of whatever the offense was maybe why he was hesitant to share his dream as Joseph had interpreted to them yet did not the chief Butler remember Joseph but forgot him after all Joseph was was that his name just a Hebrew slave he had to be guilty of something to be in the prison everyone in prison claims to be innocent uh he's not really a dream inter lucky guess he he he lacks of training he doesn't even have the manual probably couldn't even read it if he did I'm sure glad to be out of detention I better get back to work which wine will Pharaoh prefer with his duck or or maybe he was just so occupied with his work being reunited with his family and wanting to forget he was ever sent to the prison that he simply forgot the prison worker and you can imagine imagine Joseph word get back to him the baker was executed the butler is back on the job Hallelujah I'm Vindicated any day now they'll come and get me I can hardly wait to get out of here a week passes he's just busy maybe he has to wait for the right moment to to get pharaoh to listen to him about me a month passes why hasn't anyone come to release me sure surely the butler must remember I I cheered him up I took really good care of him while he was here especially those last three days and the dream interpretations were specific and spoton a year passes this is Pharaoh's birthday the anniversary of the butler being restored surely he'll remember of pharaoh now and I'll finally get out of here and the next day I'll never get out of here here I wish I'd never been born this is just too much it's so unfair another lesson for us we need to remember to put our ultimate hope not in our fellow inmates but in the Lord we're often told that Joseph is a a type a model of Jesus do you see some parallels here consider these two men are in prison with Joseph they're conversing with him and of the two with Joseph one will received life the other death and not just death but Eternal death little sidebar did you ever wonder why Egypt never created an Empire they'd send their army out go on raids take gold take stuff slaves whatever and they'd come back to Egypt they didn't set up colonies they were right on the Mediterranean but they did not become a nation that did a lot of shipping they had to take a boat someplace and get on the Nile put up the sail you go up the Nile take down the sail you go down the nail it doesn't take a lot of skillful seamanship in order to handle going up and down the river and if they went across into the Sinai across the the Red Sea there to some of the mines they had they were adjacent to Egypt they never strayed from Egypt for any length of time why in the religion of Egypt your body had to be buried in Egypt and your body had to be whole for you to have a chance of surviving in the afterlife if your body somehow was dismembered all the pieces had to be buried together that's why such care was taken to mummify by the bodies of the deceased that could afford it and the reason that mummies were buried with what they called canopic jars containing the removed organs the you know the the liver and the lungs and the heart and whatever those four jars that they would have but they always kept them with the body because they had to be buried together but the baker would be decapitated his body impaled on a pole for the birds to eat no hope of afterlife for him it wasn't just condemned and killed and buried cut off for eternity this is Extreme punishment Eternal and now a parallel and you know this one brother brandom shared it in the six-fold purpose of Gabriel's instructions to Daniel which brother Daniel asked us all to hear last September so you're familiar with this one two men are crucified with Jesus they're conversing with him and of the two with Jesus one will receive life this day will you be with me in Paradise the other death we're familiar with that parallel but here's another one consider this one Jesus at the Last Supper Matthew 26 as they were eating Jesus Took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for me many for the remission of sins and Paul expands this just a bit for us in 1 Corinthians 11 the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me broken for you how often was his body broken for you once and the baker bread would have his body broken and consumed once after the same manner also he took the cup when he had Sut saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do is of as you drink it in remembrance of me in remembrance of Me Jesus says you'll drink this many times and when you do every time remember me and what does Joseph ask the butler the one who handles the cup many times remember me we keep looking for Jesus in the Old Testament he's not hard to find because he's everywhere in it even in the prison with Joseph as he talks to the two other inmates interprets their dreams three days in a pit before restoration to life speaking of Joseph let's get back to Genesis we finished chap chapter 40 and we're now at 41 411 it came to pass at the end of two full years that Pharaoh dreamed two years look in your Bibles not your iPad not your phone app but if you have one a physical Bible I'll put another slide on the screen to help you a photo from one of my Bibles there do you see it a very important part of our story of Joseph in prison no let me draw a box around it for you there what is it brother ly it's the white space much like the meanwhile that we discussed last time two full years between the end of chapter 40 and the beginning of chapter 41 have you ever considered what was happening during those two long years while Joseph was in the dungeon apart from his despair his occasional pity party while he toiled away at his new set of responsibilities and no doubt wondering why me Lord what did I do to deserve this this is just so unfair we need to remember the nature of the prison facility and learn a bit about Egypt at the time of the 12th Dynasty and the reign of this Pharaoh Senor shet to the Pharaoh currently on the throne without it the two years may seem wasted they weren't and some of the subsequent chapters of the story of Joseph espec especially in the latter part of chapter 47 just make little or no sense without a little bit of historical context Egyptian history's complex I want to give you a very simple timeline get you to Joseph's era again to help provide context the first time Egypt was United as a nation rather than as a series of towns or Villages along the Nile began the period known as the Old Kingdom the Old King kingom is generally regarded as beginning about 2700 BC and ending about 2200 BC during this time the king the pharaoh ruled as an absolute monarch prior to this there was no Pharaoh there was no United Egypt and we're all familiar with the term Pharaoh it's not a name it's not even a title it literally means great house but it's a word often used to refer to king of Egypt I mentioned the pyramids there it was during this time that the fourth Dynasty ruler Pharaoh SFU built the first true pyramid called The Red Pyramid on his third known attempt this is a photo of that pyramid and a nearly 5,000 year old statue of sneferu 4700 years and another one with me inside pointing out some of the pyramid's internal construction features The Red Pyramid was completed about 2600 BC the subsequent pyramids of Giza were built during the period of the Old Kingdom mostly in the 2500s BC I mentioned the fourth Dynasty a dynasty simply means that the pharaohs were in direct line of descent father to son father to son father to son until there were no more male heirs in that line or until a coup or a war or some other event replace that family line with another and thus a new Dynasty so pyramids were were built during during the Old Kingdom that's followed by a disintegration of the central government the Old Kingdom collapsed Egypt entered What's called the first intermediate period that lasted from about 2200 to about 2050 BC for 150 years they were just no central government this is when Abram and Sarai were in Egypt to flee from a famine in Canaan during this time the country was split into many smaller divisions called gnomes and in the end there were 42 such districts we might think of them as States or counties largely independent I've shown these 42 gnomes on the maps of the slide and I know it's too small to see the idea is that they're small there's lots of them and they're small got an arrow linking the two places because because our screen isn't portrait mode it's landscape mode and Egypt is a country that was made in portrait mode so so it's not important to know the number of these gnomes but it's important to understand that this is how Egypt was governed after the Old Kingdom Period gnomes were run by rulers known as nomarchs the Middle Kingdom it Rose from the chaos of the intermediate period starting about 2050 BC you don't have to remember the years it's just you know it's 4,000 years ago right lasted until about 1650 BC in this period Egypt was again United became very powerful military and economic power the 12th Dynasty during which Joseph lived is often considered the greatest of the Middle Kingdom Period and that dynasty ruled from about 1991 to about 1802 BC almost 200 years Senor threet 2 the pharaoh who had issues with his Butler and Baker ruled from 189 7 to 1878 BC not tonight but at some point you'll see the importance of that Joseph's white space began at age 28 about 1887 BC in the prison in Piper's Palace now S 2 was a powerful King and you can wake up now soret 2 was a powerful King but many of the nomars in his time were nearly as powerful as him remember this is just at the end of a period when the no marks ran everything politics in Egypt was a careful and dangerous business history tells us soru had good relationships with the nomarchs during his Reign this again will prove very important to our story well back to the white space who were the VIP prisoners that passed to the king's prison during those two years because essentially if you offended the king were either executed or given a royal timeout a timeout in The Roundhouse these would have been men of influence officials even narks VIPs Farm Workers weren't likely to offend the pharaoh who was Joseph put in charge of to look after to take care of these very and very powerful people during their time out the prison was not a destination it was a waypoint no VIP served a long sentence that sort of thing just didn't exist 4,000 years ago in Egypt so Joseph despite being a despised Hebrew and in a slave would nonetheless be compassionate sympathetic listening ear to anyone who wanted to complain or vent as as we just read with the those two guys in their dreams during this time Joseph wasn't asleep he would have learned a lot about Palace politics how do things work here adding to what he'd learned at Piper's House Parties when he was a COO who's in who's out why who was sympathetic who was not which no marks were aligned with Senor threat and which were less aligned where the loyalties were where the money and influence flowed what sort of person each VIP was nowadays we talk it about networking right by spending time serving the VIPs during their detention he got to know and know about many of the narks and their lieutenants and other senior officials this is going to prove to be very important for him soon all the while serving to the best of his ability learning keeping the place running smoothly and efficiently maintaining his Integrity in the face of his ongoing crushing seemingly NeverEnding adversity another lesson from Joseph not giving into the why me because it's not about me it's about him I'm reminded of an acquaintance who walked away from following the Lord Christian person I dearly loved was sick I prayed and prayed for them to be healed but the person died if God is the Healer if the prayer of faith will save the sick and I know my faith was strong and my prayers heartfelt in Earnest then why did this person die I can't believe and serve a God Who Lies an atheist classmate of mine in high school often said Man created God in his own image sadly he had plenty of evidence the problem is that we tend to create a caricature an image of God in our minds brother Daniel preached about this a while back based on a very imperfect understanding of him and his word we serve God but we we're often serving the god that we believe him to be when things don't go as we want or expect we blame God how could God let this happen to me or to them them God's not at fault it's the incorrect or incomplete image of God we've created in our minds the Battleground what we need to do is know God better not blame him for not matching the image we've created of him understand and accept his sovereignty he's not a tool in our tool box where we say in the name of Jesus and therefore he's got to do it the genie in the bottle that's not who he is we need to align our values with his not his with ours Psalm 37 I I Delight thyself also in the Lord and He Shall give Thee the desires of thine heart and I I remember for years thinking this means well if I if I Delight myself in the Lord then then but I really desire to have a wonderful wife and and great kids and a good job I'll get a wonderful wife wife and I did and great kids and a and a good job but that's not what it says Delight thyself in the lord well if you're doing that what is the desire of your heart the desire of your heart is to delight yourself in the Lord and therefore he has given you that desire of your heart because that's what you're doing is delighting yourself in the Lord align your values wildes values with his values we often want relief from our troubles when the Lord's promise is to comfort us to be with us through the tough times we kept reading in prison in slavery and the Lord was with Joseph we need to learn from our troubles as he Comforts us just as Joseph will eventually realize that it really was the Lord sending him to Egypt that he had to be sent in exactly the way he was sent work on Piper's estate as a slave become coo and then back into the pit for those long years it was the best way possible for him to be able to fulfill his role in God's plan we'll see this as we get further in this series Joseph's compassionate ear for those who cared to share would provide Comfort soulless but not relief not release from prison again modeling Jesus who promised to be our comforter back to our story Genesis 41 it came to pass at the end of two full years about 1886 BC that pharaoh senusret to dreamed and behold he stood by the river and behold there came up out of the river seven well-favored cattle fat fleshed they fed in a meadow and behold seven other cattle came up after them out of the river ill-favored lean fleshed and stood by the other cattle upon the brink of the river and the ill flavored and lean fleshed cattle did eat up the seven well favored and fat cattle so Pharaoh awoke he slept and dreamed a second time and behold seven ears of grain came up on one stock Rank and that doesn't mean modern rank it means they were fat plump healthy and good and behold seven thin ears blasted with the East Wind sprung up after them and the Seven thin ears devoured the seven Rank and full ears and Pharaoh awoke and behold it was a dream a nightmare nightmare on the Nile it came to pass in the morning his Spirit was troubled and he sent and called for All The Magicians of Egypt and all the wise men thereof and Pharaoh told them his dream but there was none that could interpret them to Pharaoh probably not the first time s thre you had nightmares but these dreams and especially the first Dre one would have troubled him greatly why yeah time for a little more background and context about Egypt specifically about Senor threat II but excuse me first a little about a primary goddess of their religion hator one of the chief goddesses in Egyptian mythology was hatur among other things she was considered the Divine mother of the Pharaoh excuse me when you get old she was often represented as a cow or as a woman having cow's ears or as a woman wearing a headdress with cows horn surrounding a sundisk hator had more temples dedicated to her than any other deity in Egypt perhaps the most prominent being located at a temple at dendera like most temples it was on the East Bank of the Nile this image of a of a pectral a kind of a of a pendant on a necklace and of a crown it was found in the Tomb of a believed to be daughter of SRU the pectral even has the name of SRU inscribed on it she would have worn these in the palace Joseph would have seen her wearing these very items not replicas these these 4,000 year old items and here's an amazing coincidence the woman the princess who merited her own special tomb in SAS ru's funerary complex this princess believed to be SAS ru's daughter just happened to be named sit hatur unet daughter of hatur of dend he's named his daughter after this goddess represented by a cow dendera sits on the bank of the Nile so the name is in effect a symbolic cow from the bank of the Nile River wow okay but didn't have Seven Daughters named after hator right correct however in the Book of the Dead the the manual on how to survive in the afterlife are very ious magic spells incantations well spell number 148 is directed to Raw the Sun God and his attendance hatur was a consort of raw in Egyptian mythology and when you bump into raw in the afterlife you're supposed to say I have come before thee oh my Lord raw I would make to flourish the seven cows and their bull Senor shred is in a panic there's too much in this dream that hits close close to home his daughter the one who will get a special tomb in his funeral complex is named after the goddess represented by a cow and there are seven cows involved straight from The Book of the Dead he wants answers he wants them now this is personal tells his appointment secretary cancel the meetings for the day tells his chief of staff get The Magicians and wise men and dream interpreters together get them in the palace and do it now how do the wise men and magicians interpret dreams they have a dream manual this fragment is located in the British museum the Papyrus is from about 1200 BC but the language that used the way the sentences are constructed and so forth is from about 1800 or 2,000 BC the very time of Joseph so this fragment is likely to be consistent with the dream scroll used in soret 2's course it was translated into English in 1935 you can download the English translation of it from the British Museum website the manual fragment in the museum lists about a 100 dreams and their meanings both ends of the scroll are missing so we aren't just how many more dream scenes it claims to interpret it's a bit hard to see in the photo I keep asking you to sit closer but some of the text is in red the remainder is in Black the stuff that's in red bad well back to Pharaoh in the palace after fitful night trying to sleep after having had a pair of back-to-back nightmares The Magicians and wise men consult the manual they're becoming frantic no there there's just nothing in here that matches your dreams Pharaoh wish we could help we'll keep looking sorry meanwhile the dream guys are scratching their heads after desperately searching to their scroll the Bible tells us they couldn't interpret the dream hoping not to incur a very upset Pharaoh's wrath and the cup Bearer we know he's nearby he may may have approached them and asked excuse me if you got a moment I I once had a a dream about squeezing wine into a cup does it say something about that let me see squeeze grapes oh oh oh yeah here it is wait brother ly are you telling us that the butler's dream was in the fragment of the dream scroll that has been preserved for thousands of years yeah the Lord not only watches over his word he watches other word too including yours including mine oh where were we let me see squeeze grapes oh yeah here it is if a man sees himself squeezing wine into a cup bad see it's in red ink right here it means his possessions will be taken from him going to lose everything sorry about that are you sure it doesn't say they'll be restored or that he'll be restored no no I'm really sorry for you but it's right here this one is very clear they'll be taken no mistake you can Bank on it oh well thank you uh sir excuse me uh Pharaoh sen uh I may know someone who can help what what what's that oh bring me another drink then spake the chief Butler un Pharaoh saying I do remember my faults this day and he speaks to Pharaoh in the third person indication of respect or Royal Court protocol Pharaoh was wroth with his servants and and put me in detention and potier the captain of the guard's house both me and the chief Baker and and we each Dreamed a Dream the same night I and he we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream there was with us a a young man I I don't recall it his name but but but he was a Hebrew a a servant a slave he doesn't indicate Joseph as a prisoner but is a slave a slave to potier the the captain of the guard and we told him what we had each dreamed and and he interpreted to us our dreams to each of us according to his dream he did interpret he didn't have a manual and it came to pass as he interpreted to us so it was me He restored unto mine office and and him he impaled well then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph and that's for next time what lessons can we take home from this oh we've talked about a few already but there are several I've related some of them as we've studied this evening I think one of the most important is that we learn from our troubles as the Lord Comforts us Comfort is a promise rescue is a Hope just as Joseph will eventually realize it really was the Lord sending him to Egypt and that he had to be sent in exactly the way he was sent and work as a slave and be confined in prison because it was the best way possible for him to be able to fulfill his role in God's great plan and we'll see this as we continue our study of Joseph's life two short selections from the gospels come to mind about what has happened so far in our story what we're in the midst of with Pharaoh's dreams on the day of his resurrection we we read in John chapter 20 then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace be unto you Shalom and when he had so said he showed them his hands and his side then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord then Jesus said to them again peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so send I you if the musicians could come at this time we're being sent just as Joseph was sent just as Jesus was sent neither had an easy Journey he's telling them this as he reminds them of his suffering his crucifixion you see these nail prints in my hands as the father has sent me I'm sending you you see these nail prints in my hands extending to them hope through the evidence of his resurrection that they're also witnessing we should not expect our journey to be easy either and from Luke chapter 12 Jesus telling his disciples about their life Journey seek not what you shall eat or what you shall drink that's the part we always remember neither be ye of doubtful mind be people of faith for all these things to the nations of the world he's not talking about Germany and America and Mexico he's talking got people of all ethnicities everybody seeks after this your father knows you have need of these things but rather Focus your efforts to seek ye the kingdom of God all these things shall be added unto you fear not little flock fear not Joseph it's your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom well as we close and pass the service back to brother Daniel I'd like us to sing about that Journey you may not know the song and that's okay but the chorus is simple and please join me in the chorus it's called keep walking I searched and I search for the road that leads to Glory I wondered if I'd ever find the way I sat down to rest for my feet had grown so weary but then I Heard a Voice Within Me say you've got to keep on walking just keep right on walking walking in the light of the Lord you'll get to Heaven someday if you walk the right way walking in the light of the Lord I pray and I prayed for the Lord to give me mercy I prayed for him to brighten up my way I was so afraid for the road became so lonely and then I Heard a Voice Within Me say you've got to keep on walking just keep right on walking walking in the light of the Lord you'll get to Heaven someday if you walk the right way walking in the light of the Lord after a while brother random describing an event of the 19 1940s I felt something going got close I stepped back up behind a great big column there I said Heavenly Father what would you have your servant do it kept [Music] going I was real still a minute I heard a deep voice say turn go back well I turned and went walking back down the street I walked I walked on past the hotel on down through South Memphis just walking on and on was going walking along there I thought Lord I don't know you said walk here I am I'm walking I just kept on walking walking walking walked out pretty near the other side of Memphis you've got to keep on walking just keep right on walking walking in the light of the Lord you'll get to Heaven someday if you walk the right way walking in the light of of the Lord amen do you appreciate [Applause] that was he talking about all these troubles trials Joseph went through and and then he put that scripture up there from Isaiah and God says you know my ways are different than your ways my ways are higher my thoughts and my ways are higher than your ways and God has a way of doing things and those ways don't change you would think Lord why don't you just make it to where I don't have to suffer why don't you just put that character right in me but he has a way that has been from the beginning to build character in a man or a woman and we see that with Joseph constantly suffering constantly in prison and we even God did not even spare his own son right from going through those things even his own son lived a hard life and finally at the end suffered as bad as anyone has ever suffered before appreciate that and I think that now we're Beyond moving beyond Joseph's suffering I think and now we're going to see what all of this that experience and and learning and everything I love the way brother Lyall said that he was when he was in prison he was learning he was learning from these political prisoners he was learning from these these people that were in there they were the they were important people and Joseph learned and now in the next part we're going to see how all that Joseph Learned was applied and it ended up saving an entire nation let's all stand for there I sought the Lord and he answered me he delivered me from everything those who look on him are R they'll never be asham they'll never be ashame this poor man cry and the Lord heard [Music] me and he save me from

man and suffered and was many times the king tried to murder murder him but he came through it and every time he sang praises to God that's King David imagine we're singing song a song written by King David how beautiful brother Eli if you would uh would you be able to break away and come up and close Daniel Daniel it's good to see you God bless you let me give a little testimony sure like to just say something here uh you know we just gone through the passing away of my dad and my aunt my uncle I'm not the one that uh Grieves openly or I try to be strong for everybody and he's uh guess it was yesterday or the day before I told my wife please pray for me I'm going through a hard time and I'm getting angry about it I was driving down the road and I was starting to tell the Lord you need to do this you need to do that you need to fix it this way so I had asked her to to pray for me and she called or sent me a text and she said how you doing today and I said uh I'm doing better today I said you must have prayed for me and I said so I started telling she said you're grieving I never thought about that when you grieve you go through something I I've always been the one that's tried to help everybody up and as I were going through this Book of Daniel I said how can a man stand and do all of that while he's going through that maybe some of those parts weren't written yeah but everyone of us goes to that but magnify the Lord give him praise he'll come through he does brother the L mentioned that white space Joseph was a man yes he was not perfect by any means those white spaces in there brother ly may very well have been times that brother he said the same thing that brother Aaron just said but God knew his character and that character was constantly being built brother Eli come on up the uh character was con constantly being built and what's written in him about him especially about this man Joseph it's all good brother Eli when the written book is written about you and me it's all going to be good because the blood of Jesus Christ is going to wipe out all the bad bless let's bow our hearts Lord Heavenly Father we just want to thank you for your love
