[29:56] answering said
[29:59] a certain man went down from Jerusalem
[30:00] to Jericho and fell among Thieves which
[30:04] stripped him of his reignment wounded
[30:06] him and departed leaving him half
[30:10] dead and by chance there came down a
[30:13] certain priest that way and when he saw
[30:17] him he passed on the other side and
[30:20] likewise a
[30:21] levite when he was at the place came and
[30:24] looked on him and passed by on the other
[30:26] side but a
[30:29] Samaritan certain Samaritan as he
[30:32] journeyed came where he was and when he
[30:36] saw him he had compassion on him and
[30:39] went to him and bound up his wounds
[30:42] pouring in oil and wine and set him on
[30:45] his own beast and brought him to an end
[30:49] and took care of him and on the tomorrow
[30:52] when he departed he took out two pence
[30:54] and gave them to the host and said unto
[30:57] him
[30:58] take care of him and whatsoever thou
[31:01] spendest more when I come again I will
[31:03] repay
[31:05] thee which now of these three thinkest
[31:09] thou was a neighbor unto him that fell
[31:11] among the

[34:14] in Lyndon in Lyndon Washington up where
[34:16] brother Josiah's from and they they have
[34:20] a they're at the fair and they have this
[34:23] booth that's set up that's just for
[34:25] people to come in and and pray for for
[34:27] them if you need prayer so brother
[34:31] Josiah and his team were there and of
[34:33] course praying for the people and in the
[34:36] big bleacher area the big big Stadium
[34:39] there there was a a man that was
[34:42] scheduled to be there and it was this
[34:43] Granger Smith and Josiah had it on his
[34:46] heart before he he just had a burden for
[34:49] this young
[34:50] man and he was performing as I said at
[34:53] the same venue and Josiah said he said I
[34:56] wanted to just meet him and shake his
[34:59] hand and I wanted to tell him that he
[35:02] should be using his influence to preach
[35:05] the gospel he said I wanted him to use
[35:08] his platform that he has and it was on
[35:12] my mind and that he said the thought
[35:14] that that came to him was to pray for
[35:18] these things that you want to tell
[35:21] him so you might not get to shake his
[35:24] hand but the Lord was speaking to Josiah
[35:26] saying well pray pray those things
[35:29] instead of you having you telling him in
[35:30] person pray those things so brother
[35:34] Josiah went and he got out in private
[35:36] and in in the booth there and no one
[35:40] knew and he prayed he said this
[35:45] platform that God has given you is not
[35:48] to Serve
[35:49] Yourself it's to serve God so then about
[35:52] that time they could hear in the stadium
[35:55] they could hear this man Granger Smith
[35:59] singing and the other day brother Josiah
[36:03] was sharing this with me he said the
[36:04] other day he was in his car and he was
[36:07] listening to the radio good
[36:11] music on the
[36:13] radio Christian music Christian radio
[36:16] and he was listening and they played
[36:17] part of a Granger Smith song and Josiah
[36:21] thought I wonder why they're playing
[36:22] country music on our gospel radio
[36:26] program and then the announcer came on
[36:30] and said this after 24
[36:34] years touring as an award-winning
[36:37] Platinum selling country music singing
[36:40] songwriter Granger Smith chose to leave
[36:43] the music business and pursue a future
[36:46] in the
[36:54] ministry when brother Josiah told me
[36:56] that I said
[36:58] that's scriptural I said you wanted to
[37:00] go shake his hand and you wanted to
[37:01] introduce him to the Lord Jesus but
[37:04] scripture says you go into your closet
[37:07] in private and you go before the Lord in
[37:11] private and then God will reward you
[37:14] openly and now this man has a podcast I
[37:18] believe he said and he's preaching the
[37:20] gospel he's answering questions and and
[37:22] brother Josiah said he's just wonderful
[37:25] he's he's really got a wonderfully
[37:27] unique
[37:28] perspective and I I just it's like well
[37:31] there's a a prayer answered and then
[37:33] brother uh Ed this
[37:35] morning he was traveling to uh New
[37:40] Mexico to Los crusis and he was gonna
[37:42] visit his son he was delivering a big
[37:44] load of material from our church to go
[37:47] to Uganda
[37:49] Africa and when he got to about Deming
[37:52] New Mexico a giant dust storm brought
[37:56] visibility almost to zero and he was
[37:59] able to get off the freeway at Demming
[38:02] and he drove into the Walmart parking
[38:04] lot there and I believe brother Ed you
[38:07] said it was about 4:00 or so that you
[38:10] about 4:30 that you pulled into this
[38:12] Walmart parking lot and the EMS said
[38:17] that I 10 was
[38:19] closed and they would not have I 10 open
[38:23] until about 7 o'clock that evening so
[38:27] three hours or so later wasn't until I
[38:31] 10 wouldn't be open you can imagine I 10
[38:32] when we have a traffic jam on I 10 you
[38:35] can imagine what it was there in New
[38:38] Mexico so brother Ed and sister Kathy
[38:42] they pull into a parking space at
[38:45] Walmart and brother Ed just lays his
[38:48] seat
[38:49] back and just lays back and and relaxes
[38:53] and he going to pass the time he he
[38:55] couldn't go back he he couldn't go
[38:58] around he couldn't go head West or Head
[39:02] East he had nowhere to go so there he is
[39:05] in the parking
[39:06] lot and
[39:09] he was just was laying there and
[39:12] something said to him the thought came
[39:14] to his mind speak to the
[39:18] storm brother Ed said he prayed to the
[39:22] Lord Jesus he said well he said Jesus
[39:26] spoke to the storm
[39:28] and it went
[39:31] away and he prayed Lord send the storm
[39:35] away and then was it on the radio
[39:39] brother no no no then you looked over
[39:41] and he looked over on the freeway and he
[39:43] sees the trucks and they start to
[39:46] move you know everything kind of cleared
[39:48] up and he looked and he could see the
[39:50] the uh the highway there and then the
[39:52] big semis they started to move and they
[39:54] started to go and he got on he says well
[39:57] let's give it a shot so they get they
[39:59] pull out of Walmart they pull up onto
[40:02] the freeway and they get onto the
[40:03] freeway and everything was wide open and
[40:06] the storm was
[40:13] gone brother Daniel do you think because
[40:18] of brother Ed's
[40:20] prayer that the storm went away and
[40:23] Interstate 10 started flowing again do
[40:26] you think
[40:27] because of brother Josiah's prayer that
[40:30] this world famous country music singer
[40:34] would give his heart to the Lord Jesus
[40:36] and start preaching the gospel brother
[40:39] Daniel do you really think that yes
[40:41] absolutely I do no I absolutely believe
[40:45] that
[40:46] yes and there is nothing wrong why pray
[40:50] if we don't expect to get what we what
[40:51] we pray
[40:52] for and I say we go into our closet we
[40:56] we sit back in our pickup
[40:58] truck we we go into our booth that we're
[41:01] witnessing to people we go to the Lord
[41:04] in private and then he will reward you
[41:08] openly he's not the Lord's not exalting
[41:11] you he's not exalting brother Ed he's
[41:13] not ex exalting brother Josiah the Lord
[41:17] is proving that he's
[41:19] God and he's blessing everyone that's
[41:22] around us when we truly have that
[41:25] relationship with the Lord Jesus
[41:28] I um want to talk about this parable of
[41:33] this Good Samaritan there's
[41:36] hospitals named after the Good Samaritan
[41:40] there's there's laws throughout the
[41:42] country the Good Samaritan law where if
[41:45] you go and you're honestly trying to
[41:47] help someone and you end up doing damage
[41:49] to that person then you are protected by
[41:52] this Good Samaritan law because you
[41:54] actually you had good motives and you
[41:56] were trying to to help there's the Billy
[41:59] Graham Evangelistic
[42:01] Association um the the
[42:05] humanitarian arm of Billy Graham
[42:08] Ministries is called Samaritan's Purse
[42:11] named after this man that we're going to
[42:15] talk about today this Good Samaritan so
[42:17] we need to understand what's going on in
[42:20] this Parable called the Good Samaritan
[42:23] it's one of those ones we've all heard
[42:25] it we all know it but do we understand
[42:28] the foundation do we understand how
[42:29] important it is it's like oh yeah well
[42:31] well if we see somebody that needs help
[42:32] you know we're supposed to help
[42:34] him that's just a little part of it it's
[42:39] a lot deeper than just helping somebody
[42:42] on the street that's just got beat up
[42:44] and sitting there bleeding there's a lot
[42:47] more to it to properly understand it I
[42:51] believe we need to put it into
[42:53] context so let's go to chap Luke chapter
[42:56] 10
[42:57] and let's see what leads up to this
[43:01] Parable that I just talked about Luke
[43:03] chap 10: 21 we could start
[43:07] there Jesus had just sent out the
[43:11] 70 disciples and they came back and they
[43:13] said Lord even the devils are subject to
[43:16] us so the the Lord Jesus was he was
[43:20] happy and in in that hour Luke 10:21 and
[43:23] in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit
[43:29] and
[43:30] said I thank thee oh Father Lord of
[43:34] Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these
[43:36] things from the wise and
[43:38] prudent and has revealed them to
[43:42] babies even so
[43:45] father for it so for so it seemed good
[43:50] in th
[43:52] sight all things are delivered to me of
[43:55] my father and no man knows know who is
[43:57] the son but who the son is but the
[44:00] father and who the father is but the son
[44:03] and he to whom the son will reveal him
[44:07] so you can only know God the Father
[44:10] through Jesus
[44:12] Christ friends Christianity is an
[44:15] exclusive thing you can only
[44:19] know God the Father through Jesus Christ
[44:23] you can't know him through the Hindu
[44:26] religion you can't know him through the
[44:28] Muslim religion you can't know him
[44:30] through these other other religions
[44:32] Jesus said I am the way the truth and
[44:34] the life and no man can come to the
[44:35] father except by me so we have to know
[44:38] Christ he's very very important and he
[44:44] turned him to his disciples and he said
[44:49] privately blessed are the eyes which see
[44:52] the things that you
[44:54] see for I tell you that many prophet
[44:57] prophets and Kings have desired to see
[44:58] the things which you see and have not
[45:01] seen them and to hear the things which
[45:03] you hear and have not heard
[45:07] them what a statement that Jesus is
[45:09] saying now he's got his group of
[45:10] disciples around here and he's saying
[45:13] listen friends
[45:15] listen that all of the great men that
[45:19] you've ever heard of Moses Elijah they
[45:23] all wanted to be in the position that
[45:26] you're in right now
[45:28] they all wanted to see what you are
[45:30] seeing they all wanted to hear what you
[45:33] are hearing they all wanted Jesus saying
[45:35] they all wanted to see
[45:37] me they all wanted to hear me they all
[45:41] wanted to hear what I have to say
[45:43] because I am the Fulfillment of
[45:46] everything he is beyond all the prophets
[45:49] wanted to hear
[45:51] him all the great ones they are nothing
[45:54] compared to this man that was standing
[45:56] before these disciples
[45:57] and speaking to them privately he is
[45:59] beyond our understanding even
[46:02] today the stars and the
[46:07] skies who placed the who placed the
[46:09] Stars up there who put life into
[46:14] US Jesus the the the Lord said to I
[46:18] Believers to Jeremiah I formed you in
[46:20] your mother's
[46:21] womb and he did all things through Jesus
[46:24] Christ so we can't know the father
[46:26] without knowing the
[46:29] Lord and there's nothing brothers and
[46:32] sisters there's nothing simple about him
[46:36] he is very complex he's very deep we
[46:40] always want to understand something a
[46:41] little bit more than Jesus or something
[46:43] Beyond Jesus there is nothing Beyond him
[46:46] he is the greatest when we open up our
[46:51] book I was witnessing to um to these
[46:55] kids in the airport I don't know a
[46:57] couple years ago and the uh I could tell
[47:01] the family I could just tell they're a
[47:02] Christian I could tell they're a sweet
[47:04] family they the kids were I don't know
[47:06] they had three two or three kids and I
[47:10] just struck up a conversation with the
[47:12] dad and then the the kids started
[47:13] talking with me and and I got down on my
[47:17] knee and I had my Bible and I said hey I
[47:20] want to show you
[47:21] something I said do you see this book
[47:24] and I showed him this and I said said
[47:27] what color is this and they said black
[47:31] and I said what color is this and they
[47:33] said red I said why is are some why is
[47:36] some of it black and some of it red and
[47:39] the kids were like I don't know there
[47:41] just little kids I don't
[47:43] know and I said that's because do you
[47:48] know who Jesus is I said yeah I said
[47:50] that's because Jesus gets his own
[47:51] special
[47:54] color in the Bible
[47:57] he's
[47:58] special he's more special than any of
[48:01] the other people in the whole Bible they
[48:04] all talked about him so he gets his own
[48:07] special color and those words that are
[48:09] in red they are deeper than any other
[48:12] words there that that are all the words
[48:14] in Black they're pointing to the words
[48:16] in red wow I heard a somebody the other
[48:21] day that was that was visiting and they
[48:24] go to a um I believe they go to an
[48:26] Apostolic Church
[48:28] um where they
[48:30] live and uh the one of them was saying
[48:34] well we we go to this Apostolic church
[48:37] because we don't have one of our
[48:39] churches there and they said you know we
[48:44] get some crumbs where we
[48:48] go I heard
[48:50] that you get some
[48:53] crumbs does I didn't say this but
[48:56] thought came to my mind does the pastor
[48:59] read the words and
[49:01] R and you're telling me those are
[49:04] crumbs those are the words of eternal
[49:07] life and I don't care who reads
[49:10] it you could you could have anybody read
[49:13] this book they are still the words of
[49:16] eternal life and they as I said they are
[49:18] deeper than anything in the world we
[49:21] talk about well we want meat we want
[49:24] maybe the the revelation of the the
[49:26] Seven Seals or or the revelation of the
[49:29] seven Thunders or or we want to we want
[49:31] to know what unlocks all of these
[49:34] Mysteries and all of that and then we
[49:36] ignore the so-called simple
[49:38] things but we can't even we can't
[49:42] understand those let me tell you the
[49:44] Seven Seals are very simple they're very
[49:47] easy to
[49:49] understand some of the things that Jesus
[49:51] said read Matthew Chapter 5 6 and 7 the
[49:54] Beatitudes those are those are meat
[49:59] those are very very deep
[50:02] teachings and you you look at these deep
[50:07] teachings and you say oh well well
[50:09] that's good well then why can nobody do
[50:13] them why are they
[50:15] so high and so difficult that no one can
[50:20] G and when Jesus is telling his
[50:21] disciples he said they've all longed all
[50:24] of these Great Men they've longed to
[50:26] hear me speak they've longed to see me
[50:30] and your eyes are blessed because you
[50:32] see
[50:34] me what do we look forward to the to the
[50:36] second
[50:38] coming why is that such a thing because
[50:42] at my eyes long to see him my ears long
[50:45] to hear him that's what I long for is to
[50:48] see this Jesus
[50:51] Christ the same one that truly the same
[50:54] one that calm the storm
[50:57] same one that called in the storm and
[50:58] diming New Mexico is the same one that
[50:59] called in the storm in the Sea of
[51:01] Galilee the same one who raised a man
[51:04] from the dead who had been dead for four
[51:05] days with
[51:07] Lazarus he was there they they called
[51:09] for him to come come your your friend is
[51:12] dying he's sick Mary and Martha's
[51:14] brother they said would you just come
[51:16] and would you would you pray for him if
[51:18] you if you'll come he won't die and then
[51:20] Jesus ignored them one day two days
[51:23] passed three days passed now Jesus said
[51:25] okay let's go see
[51:27] Lazarus the word comes back Lazarus is
[51:31] dead he says
[51:33] no well no
[51:36] actually the word comes the word comes
[51:38] back Jesus tells his disciples he says
[51:40] Lazarus is
[51:42] dead so they get so they get to the to
[51:45] the Grave Lazarus is always buried he'd
[51:48] be in the grave for four
[51:50] days you know what happens to a body
[51:52] after four days especially in the desert
[51:54] what it does and here's Jesus he says
[51:56] roll away the stone and he says Lazarus
[52:00] come forth and a man that was dead for 4
[52:02] days came out of the
[52:05] Grave that
[52:07] man that's who I longed to see the same
[52:09] one who was on Mount Transfiguration
[52:11] with two of the greatest prophets that
[52:14] were ever that had ever lived they they
[52:15] go up to the mountain Jesus and his and
[52:18] Peter James and John and here come two
[52:21] men that had lived hundreds of years
[52:24] before two of the greatest prophets
[52:26] stand standing next to him Moses and
[52:29] Elijah Peter's like
[52:32] whoa those are two prophets he knew who
[52:34] they
[52:35] were he's like
[52:37] Lord let's build three Tabernacles here
[52:40] let's build build these three places of
[52:42] worship one for Moses one for
[52:45] Elijah and one for you and then God's
[52:48] voice rang out
[52:50] this is my beloved
[52:53] Son hear ye him
[52:57] the greatest one that had ever
[52:59] lived same one who said I the same one
[53:02] who preached to the these disciples he
[53:04] said something that no man could ever
[53:06] say from the time that that man was
[53:09] created till the time now he said I Lay
[53:12] My Life
[53:14] down we can all say
[53:16] that but then he said and I will raise
[53:20] it back up again none of us can do that
[53:23] none of us could even say that but Jesus
[53:25] could say that the same one who says who
[53:28] said before Abraham was I am he said you
[53:33] think you're sons of Abraham said before
[53:36] Abraham was I am who could say things
[53:38] like that who could say something like
[53:41] that and then God honor it the same one
[53:44] he said they they they were getting on
[53:45] Jesus for not for eating uh for picking
[53:49] Grain on the Sabbath he said listen he
[53:51] says I am the lord of the
[53:53] Sabbath who could write who could say
[53:55] such things
[53:57] as this man Jesus the Apostle Paul wrote
[53:59] this God who had Sund drry times and in
[54:02] diverse manners spake in times
[54:04] past by The Prophet by the prophets hath
[54:08] in these days spoken unto us by his
[54:11] son whom Heath appointed heir of all
[54:14] things and by whom also he made the
[54:15] worlds he's saying that yeah God spoke
[54:18] in the times past by the prophets but in
[54:20] this man this man that he's speaking
[54:22] through now that's how he made the stars
[54:24] in the sky that's how he made the the
[54:26] Earth that we stand in that's how he
[54:28] made the Sun and the
[54:30] Moon he made it through this man through
[54:33] his
[54:34] son by whom also he made the world who
[54:37] being in the brightness of his
[54:39] glory and the expressed image of his
[54:44] person so the express image if you look
[54:48] at Jesus Christ you see God the
[54:50] father and upholding All Things by the
[54:53] word of his power when he had
[54:56] by himself purged our sins Christ when
[55:01] he wiped away our
[55:02] sins he sat down on the right hand of
[55:05] the Majesty on high who could say
[55:09] that we can't say that about anyone but
[55:12] this man Jesus
[55:15] Christ Arie when he was
[55:18] praying he said
[55:20] imagine we can talk to the
[55:23] Creator the same one I'm talking about
[55:26] right now now we can talk to
[55:28] him we can we can speak directly to him
[55:32] we can go into our closet we can go into
[55:34] the PRI in our private room and we can
[55:36] speak to this one that knows all things
[55:38] that has done all things and we can
[55:41] speak to
[55:44] him Revelation chapter
[55:47] 5 talked I mentioned the Seven
[55:50] Seals and how important how how these
[55:53] Seven Seals what what they mean
[55:57] but we don't want to just look at the
[55:59] seal it's what's behind the seal that
[56:03] matters the seal is just a a piece of
[56:05] wax that that closes the book and then
[56:08] it's sealed with Seven Seals so you have
[56:12] to break them to open the book but
[56:13] what's important is not the seal what's
[56:15] important is inside the
[56:16] book and that's how when John was there
[56:19] and he's seeing these Visions in the
[56:21] Book of Revelation and he looks and he
[56:23] sees that that book that was sealed with
[56:25] Seven Seals they said who is worthy to
[56:28] open this book in John through the power
[56:30] and the Revelation that he had he knew
[56:33] that his name was in that book there was
[56:36] Redemption inside of that book and if no
[56:38] one could open it then all was
[56:41] lost what would you
[56:44] do what would you do if someone said
[56:47] that this is the book of redemption and
[56:50] it's sealed and no one is worthy to open
[56:53] it what so everything that I've
[56:56] everything that I've lived for it's all
[56:58] lost we're all going to hell There's No
[57:02] Redemption and
[57:06] then the angel John just starts weeping
[57:09] the angel says John John John don't weep
[57:13] for the lion of the tribe of
[57:16] Judah he is worthy and John looked to
[57:20] see a lion and he sees a lamb a bloody
[57:24] lamb that was slain that was killed that
[57:27] was slain on the cross and John I
[57:29] guarantee you recognized who that
[57:32] was it was the
[57:34] one that taught him that said all men
[57:38] desire to see what you see all men want
[57:41] to hear what you what you hear and there
[57:43] is John he was there when Jesus said
[57:45] that and he knows that this man that's
[57:47] how important this great man was this
[57:51] Jesus we look at the Beatitudes we look
[57:54] at Matthew Chapter 5 this first big
[57:56] sermon that Jesus preached he's up on
[57:58] the hill and he preached this everything
[58:01] that he said was a
[58:03] masterpiece and he preaches these things
[58:06] that no one had heard I could spend my
[58:08] whole life preaching three times a week
[58:11] on just the
[58:14] Beatitudes I could do it and it would
[58:16] never get old I promise and that's how
[58:18] Jesus's words are they are so deep they
[58:21] are wonderful Matthew Chapter 5 he said
[58:24] um Jesus said You' have heard that it
[58:26] was said that you shall not commit
[58:27] adultery but I say to you that everyone
[58:29] who looks upon a woman with lustful
[58:31] intense has committed adultery with her
[58:32] in his
[58:33] heart if your right eye causes you to
[58:36] sin tear it out throw it
[58:40] away for it is better to you to lose one
[58:43] of your members and your then your whole
[58:45] body be thrown into hell if your right
[58:47] hand causes you to sin cut it off and
[58:48] throw it away for it's better for you to
[58:50] lose one of your members than the whole
[58:52] body go to
[58:53] hell Jesus speaking
[58:56] he's saying this is how important it
[58:58] is he said that that you heard it said
[59:01] an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth
[59:02] but I say to you do not resist the one
[59:05] who is evil but if any man slaps you
[59:07] down on the right cheek Brother G If any
[59:09] man slaps you down on the right cheek
[59:12] turn to him in the other one also and if
[59:13] anyone would say to you and take would
[59:16] take your tunic and then give him your
[59:18] cloak as
[59:19] well and if anyone forces you to go a
[59:22] mile with him go two miles with him
[59:27] give to the one who begs from you and
[59:29] don't refuse one that would borrow from
[59:31] you so this man that forces you to go a
[59:35] mile with him it's not like hey he you
[59:36] want to go for a walk let's go for a
[59:38] mile okay I'll go go to with you
[59:41] no it's put you in
[59:45] handcuffs and say let's walk a
[59:49] mile let's go buddy not against your
[59:53] will and then you say okay because you
[59:56] have told me this I'm going to go too
[59:58] with you someone who takes my
[1:00:02] jacket okay you took my you stole it I'm
[1:00:06] gonna give you my tie too I'm gonna give
[1:00:10] you more than you steal from me who
[1:00:12] could say these things who could do
[1:00:14] these
[1:00:15] things but Jesus lived what he said you
[1:00:19] have heard that you shall love your
[1:00:20] neighbor and hate your enemy but I say
[1:00:22] to you love your enemies and pray for
[1:00:24] those who persecute you that you may be
[1:00:26] sons of your father who is in heaven for
[1:00:28] he makes his son to rise on the evil and
[1:00:30] on the
[1:00:31] good and sends rain on the just and the
[1:00:33] unjust if you love the ones who love you
[1:00:36] what reward do you have do not even the
[1:00:39] tax collectors do the same and if you
[1:00:41] greet only your brothers what only your
[1:00:43] brothers what more are you doing than
[1:00:47] others do not even the Gentiles do the
[1:00:50] same you therefore must be
[1:00:54] perfect as your heavenly father father
[1:00:56] is
[1:00:58] perfect we say
[1:01:00] well brother Daniel perfect is kind of a
[1:01:03] high a high level I didn't say it it's
[1:01:06] in
[1:01:07] red in the
[1:01:10] book
[1:01:12] Jesus he wasn't a
[1:01:15] hypocrite the things that he said is the
[1:01:17] life that he led he said love your enemy
[1:01:20] as I just read love your enemy and pray
[1:01:22] for those who persecute you
[1:01:26] not
[1:01:27] only did Jesus love his
[1:01:32] enemy and pray for those that persecute
[1:01:35] him his his virgin mother was accused of
[1:01:39] being an immoral woman who slept with
[1:01:41] the Roman
[1:01:44] soldier the ones that spit in his
[1:01:46] face these ones that are lying about his
[1:01:49] mom a perfect lady lying about his
[1:01:53] mother spitting in his face the ones
[1:01:55] that stripped him naked in front of
[1:01:58] everybody embarrassed him and nailed him
[1:02:00] to the Cross all right those these
[1:02:03] people those are the ones he prayed for
[1:02:06] he was up there on the cross dying and
[1:02:08] he says father forgive them the ones
[1:02:11] that did this to me the ones that said
[1:02:13] that about my mom the ones that nailed
[1:02:14] me to this cross forgive them Lord for
[1:02:18] they know not what they
[1:02:21] do John 15:13 Jesus says greater love
[1:02:25] hath no man than this
[1:02:26] that a man lay down his life for his
[1:02:29] friends he took it a step further and he
[1:02:31] laid down his life for his
[1:02:33] enemies that's this
[1:02:36] Jesus when I say when I hear crumbs you
[1:02:39] mean like the
[1:02:40] Beatitudes
[1:02:44] no if you could
[1:02:47] ask Jesus Christ now now that I've said
[1:02:51] that if you could ask the Lord Jesus one
[1:02:54] thing if if you had a moment if you
[1:02:57] could walk up to
[1:03:01] him and have one question and say
[1:03:04] Lord I just want to ask you this one
[1:03:06] thing think about it right now what
[1:03:08] would you
[1:03:11] ask what question would you want to
[1:03:13] answer would it be Lord would you tell
[1:03:15] me about the Seven Seals would you
[1:03:17] explain that I don't really understand
[1:03:18] that seventh one it's just silence in
[1:03:21] heaven would it be to reveal would you
[1:03:23] Lord would you tell me about the seven
[1:03:24] Thunders
[1:03:26] I don't understand that would it be Lord
[1:03:28] how if you just tell me how to move
[1:03:30] mountains you said that that if you just
[1:03:32] if you just speak it then that the that
[1:03:35] the father would take this mountain and
[1:03:36] then throw it in the Sea Lord if you
[1:03:38] would just show me how to move mountains
[1:03:40] would it be that if you had a chance
[1:03:43] just to ask him would it be tell us the
[1:03:46] meaning of life why are we
[1:03:49] here maybe why did I have a child that
[1:03:52] died why did these things happen to me
[1:03:54] in my life
[1:03:56] why do so many bad things happen to good
[1:03:58] people would you ask him that
[1:04:02] maybe would you ask him a question that
[1:04:06] would lead to the answer to all the
[1:04:08] other
[1:04:10] questions and would
[1:04:12] you ask him a question that would give
[1:04:15] you wisdom so that you might help others
[1:04:17] answer those
[1:04:19] questions you would have help others
[1:04:22] receive the answers to their difficult
[1:04:24] questions like that if you just had one
[1:04:27] question for the Lord Jesus what would
[1:04:31] it
[1:04:32] be think about
[1:04:34] it somebody was given that
[1:04:37] opportunity let's go back to Luke
[1:04:39] chapter 10 ver
[1:04:42] 25 a certain
[1:04:45] lawyer and behold a certain lawyer stood
[1:04:48] up and tempted
[1:04:51] him saying here's the question master
[1:04:56] what shall I do to inherit eternal
[1:05:00] life this this wasn't a lawyer this man
[1:05:04] speaking he wasn't a lawyer like we
[1:05:06] think of a lawyer where you try a case
[1:05:08] in court he was a lawyer of the law he
[1:05:11] was a lawyer of Moses's writings it was
[1:05:13] his job to interpret this law so he was
[1:05:17] very well well learned he knew Exodus
[1:05:20] Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy he knew
[1:05:23] them very very well to where he could
[1:05:25] present a case maybe against someone or
[1:05:28] for someone he had the wrong attitude
[1:05:31] towards Jesus he was seeking out an
[1:05:34] argument because it says to tempt him he
[1:05:37] was putting Jesus most translations say
[1:05:40] he was putting Jesus to the
[1:05:42] test and here's a 30-year-old man this
[1:05:46] Jesus Christ and here's this lawyer this
[1:05:49] experienced lawyer Jesus had no formal
[1:05:51] education this guy had all the formal
[1:05:53] education that that you could have so he
[1:05:55] was looking to start a
[1:05:58] discussion with Jesus to tempt him but
[1:06:02] he asked the most perfect question that
[1:06:05] you could ever ask is Lord how can I
[1:06:08] receive eternal life because if I
[1:06:11] understand how then I can help others do
[1:06:14] the
[1:06:16] same then Jesus answered he knew who he
[1:06:18] was talking to he answered and he said
[1:06:20] what's written in the law how readest
[1:06:23] thou so he's saying what's written in
[1:06:25] the law Mr lawyer how do you read what's
[1:06:29] written in the law to answer this
[1:06:31] question that you
[1:06:33] asked Man shows he's Ed educated and he
[1:06:35] showed his shows his knowledge of the
[1:06:37] scriptures and and he answering said
[1:06:39] Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
[1:06:41] all thy heart with all thy soul and with
[1:06:42] all thy strength and with all my thy
[1:06:44] mind and thy neighbor as thyself so he's
[1:06:47] quoting the Old Testament he's saying
[1:06:49] here's how you receive eternal
[1:06:52] life and he and Jesus said unto him
[1:06:56] you have answered
[1:06:58] right this do and you'll
[1:07:02] live so basically you already have the
[1:07:05] answer do it Amplified Bi Bible says do
[1:07:09] this habitually all the time and you'll
[1:07:14] live and then when the lawyer starts
[1:07:16] thinking about
[1:07:18] it when he starts thinking about wow all
[1:07:22] of these things I just read the
[1:07:23] Beatitudes and I said who does it
[1:07:27] and we think oh that's so simple yeah
[1:07:29] but love your love your neighbor as
[1:07:32] yourself oh
[1:07:36] well well what if he really meant
[1:07:38] something else because maybe my life
[1:07:41] doesn't match up with that and that's
[1:07:43] what this lawyer is saying he's saying
[1:07:45] love the Lord thy God with all thy heart
[1:07:47] okay I got that part but love your
[1:07:49] neighbor like what do you mean love your
[1:07:52] neighbor like the good neighbor or the
[1:07:54] Bad Neighbor
[1:07:56] I have two in my
[1:07:58] house you mean the one over here I got
[1:08:00] to love him like I love
[1:08:04] myself he starts thinking about his own
[1:08:07] life first John says if someone says I
[1:08:10] love God and hates his brother he is a
[1:08:13] liar for he who does not love his
[1:08:15] brother whom he has seen how can he love
[1:08:17] God whom he has not seen and this
[1:08:20] commandment we have from him that he who
[1:08:22] loves God must love his brother also so
[1:08:25] Jesus is looking at the man and he and
[1:08:27] Jesus may have paused for a second after
[1:08:29] he asked that
[1:08:30] question and he's saying so love your
[1:08:32] neighbor more than your love yourself
[1:08:36] and he starts maybe thinking so the guy
[1:08:38] who drive when when I'm emerging onto
[1:08:39] the highway so the guy who drives around
[1:08:41] me in the turning lane and gets in front
[1:08:43] of me and so I gotta love him I got to
[1:08:46] give him the lane I never do
[1:08:50] that I'm just bringing it down to
[1:08:51] reality that's what he's talking
[1:08:53] about when you take a group picture you
[1:08:56] know we all do we take a group picture
[1:09:00] and and we post
[1:09:02] it it's like man I look really fat my
[1:09:06] hair is all messed up and but
[1:09:11] boy Joseph's looking good you know what
[1:09:15] I'm gonna even though I look really bad
[1:09:17] I'm gonna post a picture because man
[1:09:18] Joseph looks really sharp sharp in that
[1:09:21] suit is that how we
[1:09:24] think but Jesus says that's how you have
[1:09:27] to think you got to pref prefer your
[1:09:30] neighbor so this lawyer is probably
[1:09:32] thinking about all these things man I
[1:09:33] posted that picture on Facebook and and
[1:09:35] I looked bad and and you know I looked
[1:09:38] really good and this other guy looked
[1:09:39] really bad and and my wife she didn't
[1:09:41] look so good but you know I looked good
[1:09:43] he's probably thinking about those
[1:09:45] things he's like man I'm not living up
[1:09:46] to
[1:09:47] this so he
[1:09:50] says but willing to justify himself
[1:09:53] verse 29 but willing to justify himself
[1:09:57] he said unto Jesus well who is my
[1:10:02] neighbor here's the place where people
[1:10:04] call themselves Christians and then they
[1:10:06] read the Beatitudes as I said the Deep
[1:10:08] part they read the Beatitudes and they
[1:10:11] see the selfless way of Jesus and they
[1:10:13] make excuses why they can hold a grudge
[1:10:16] against somebody they make excuses why
[1:10:18] they don't pray well I pray all the time
[1:10:20] it's just it's just not on my knees I
[1:10:22] have a relationship with God I just
[1:10:23] don't go to church but I'm a Christian
[1:10:28] what is church anyways really Define
[1:10:31] Church do I really have to go to
[1:10:33] church when you don't go to church not
[1:10:37] only does it remove that Dedication that
[1:10:39] you have in getting ready and getting
[1:10:41] the kids ready and going to church it
[1:10:43] not only does it remove that and that
[1:10:45] that that thing that you do at least
[1:10:46] once a week that you come in and you you
[1:10:49] get prayer and and you read your Bible
[1:10:52] and you get a and you get a sermon not
[1:10:54] only do does take does that take it out
[1:10:56] you can't watch YouTube and get
[1:10:59] it but it also when you don't come to
[1:11:03] church it takes you your gift that
[1:11:06] you're supposed to bring in it takes you
[1:11:08] out of the church so I'm not blessed by
[1:11:11] you being
[1:11:12] here we always think of
[1:11:14] ourselves but you if you don't come it
[1:11:18] takes you out so this lawyer instead of
[1:11:20] asking Jesus how do I do
[1:11:23] that how do I
[1:11:26] really love my neighbor as
[1:11:29] myself he seeks to justify himself and
[1:11:33] he says really who is my neighbor what
[1:11:34] he should have done is Lord how do I
[1:11:36] really do
[1:11:37] that and
[1:11:39] Jesus but he didn't ask that he was
[1:11:43] trying to
[1:11:45] chide and Jesus answering he says well
[1:11:48] who is my my neighbor and Jesus
[1:11:50] answering said a certain man he and he
[1:11:52] answered I love the way Jesus answers
[1:11:55] many many times and this is a learned
[1:11:58] professional lawyer that knows
[1:12:01] everything and Jesus says let me tell
[1:12:03] you a
[1:12:05] story and Jesus answering said a certain
[1:12:09] man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho
[1:12:11] and fell among Thieves which stripped
[1:12:13] him of his reignment and wounded him and
[1:12:16] departed leaving him half dead now we
[1:12:19] are assuming this man is a Jew because
[1:12:21] it doesn't say that he's not a Jew when
[1:12:24] the Bible almost always when the Bible
[1:12:27] identifies someone as not being a Jew it
[1:12:29] tells us and otherwise we just assume
[1:12:33] that it is a Jew so we assume that this
[1:12:34] man is a
[1:12:36] Jew and he's going down this road from
[1:12:40] Jerusalem to Jericho which is between 15
[1:12:42] and 20 miles and it's actually a very
[1:12:44] dangerous
[1:12:45] road where robbers would hang out and
[1:12:48] and wait for people either going up to
[1:12:51] Jerusalem to worship and to sacrifice or
[1:12:53] coming back they would wait wait on this
[1:12:56] Jericho Road and Rob those that may not
[1:13:00] be protected
[1:13:02] well so this
[1:13:04] man certain man went down from Jer from
[1:13:07] Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among
[1:13:09] Thieves which stripped him of his
[1:13:10] reignment and wounded him and departed
[1:13:13] leaving him half dead and by chance
[1:13:16] there came down a certain priest that
[1:13:17] way and when he saw him he passed on the
[1:13:20] other side so he saw the guy laying on
[1:13:23] the road and he didn't want to deal with
[1:13:25] it he sees him over here he says uh I'm
[1:13:29] I'm going to go over here this is a
[1:13:31] person of his own race a Jew and here
[1:13:34] goes the preacher and he's like you know
[1:13:38] I just don't want to deal with it today
[1:13:39] I'm gonna walk over on this
[1:13:41] side and likewise a levite now a priest
[1:13:46] is a levite but not all Levites are
[1:13:49] priests but the levite probably did work
[1:13:52] in the temple probably did work in the
[1:13:54] church and and help and and do religious
[1:13:57] things and likewise a levite when he was
[1:14:01] at that place he came and he looked on
[1:14:03] him and he passed by on the other
[1:14:06] side both of these Jews ignored the
[1:14:10] problem that was passing over there this
[1:14:12] half dead Jew on their own
[1:14:16] race and there was definitely racism
[1:14:18] back then don't forget they were very
[1:14:21] much separated and these two Jews saw
[1:14:23] one of their own laying there and they
[1:14:25] didn't help there's a
[1:14:28] story about this man named Martin of
[1:14:31] Tours he was born in 316 ad long time
[1:14:36] ago he joined the military as a young
[1:14:39] man and it was a cold winter day and
[1:14:44] Martin is there on his horse and he see
[1:14:48] looks down and he sees this
[1:14:52] beggar there half dressed dress didn't
[1:14:55] have clothes and he was shivering Martin
[1:14:58] looks down on him and he had compassion
[1:15:01] on him so Martin takes his big heavy
[1:15:04] coat and he cuts it in
[1:15:06] half and he with his with his sword and
[1:15:09] he takes his coat and he wraps the poor
[1:15:12] beggar in his coat and he takes his
[1:15:15] piece of his coat and he wraps himself
[1:15:17] with it and he says now we can both
[1:15:19] survive the night that
[1:15:22] night Martin goes to bed and he has a
[1:15:27] vision and there is the Lord Jesus came
[1:15:31] to Martin and there he is wrapped in
[1:15:34] Martin's
[1:15:35] coat and he says what you have done
[1:15:38] Martin what you have done for the least
[1:15:40] of these you have done it to
[1:15:42] me an experience LED Martin to give his
[1:15:45] heart to the Lord he got baptized quit
[1:15:48] the military and dedicated his life to
[1:15:51] serving others this man Martin brother
[1:15:53] brandham said I don't believe there was
[1:15:55] a greater man ever on the earth outside
[1:15:57] of Jesus Christ than St
[1:16:00] Martin it's pretty high
[1:16:03] compliment I'm a very important person
[1:16:06] why because Martin was one of the few
[1:16:09] people who actually put Christianity
[1:16:11] into action and it wasn't a great
[1:16:13] miracle that Martin performed he just
[1:16:15] made a
[1:16:18] sacrifice verse number
[1:16:20] 33 but a certain Samaritan as he
[1:16:23] journeyed came came where he was and
[1:16:26] when he saw him he had compassion on him
[1:16:29] he had compassion on this man that was
[1:16:30] there laying there half dead Samaritans
[1:16:33] and Jews didn't
[1:16:38] mix they a Jew would call a Samaritan an
[1:16:41] unclean person Samaritan would call a
[1:16:44] Jew the same
[1:16:45] thing and he went to him and he bound up
[1:16:48] his wounds pouring oil and wine pouring
[1:16:50] in oil and wine and set him on his own
[1:16:52] beast and brought him into the end and
[1:16:54] took care of him and on the tomorrow
[1:16:56] when he departed he took two pence and
[1:16:58] gave it to the host and said unto him
[1:17:00] take care of him and whatsoever thou
[1:17:02] spendest when I come again I will repay
[1:17:05] you he took the wine and poured it on
[1:17:08] his wounds the antiseptic and the
[1:17:10] alcohol the wine to clean the wounds so
[1:17:13] they wouldn't get in infected he took
[1:17:15] the oil and he rubbed it on there to
[1:17:18] maybe maybe soothe the
[1:17:20] pain sister Lonnie is probably like a
[1:17:22] modern day an oldfashioned meal
[1:17:25] boring where it had an antiseptic
[1:17:28] property and and it it soothed the pain
[1:17:31] and he and he helped him not only did he
[1:17:35] help the man's wounds but he also paid
[1:17:37] the money to give him proper care now I
[1:17:41] want to note that this Jew wasn't
[1:17:42] homeless he wasn't a drug addict he
[1:17:45] didn't squander his money he wasn't a
[1:17:47] person that who helping would just make
[1:17:49] him go to the nearest drug deal or a
[1:17:52] dispensary or liquor liquor store this
[1:17:55] man was attacked he was left for dead
[1:17:58] and he would have died if no one helped
[1:17:59] him so what
[1:18:01] possessed the Samaritan to do that for a
[1:18:05] complete
[1:18:06] stranger remember the question Jesus is
[1:18:10] telling the whole story he's
[1:18:12] saying the whole question was what do I
[1:18:15] need to do to get eternal life and Jesus
[1:18:18] tells the story of the Good
[1:18:22] Samaritan brother Ron told me brother
[1:18:25] Ron glidewell I don't know if he's here
[1:18:26] there he is um he told me a story last
[1:18:30] night um by the way I was very proud of
[1:18:34] our church yesterday we were there with
[1:18:37] um brother
[1:18:39] uh
[1:18:43] um we were there at uh the hospital last
[1:18:51] night uh for Brother Dan Brother Dan was
[1:18:55] was very sick he's he's dying in the
[1:18:57] hospital and we went to visit him and
[1:19:00] the family many of you know brother Dan
[1:19:02] Roberts and family they they used to
[1:19:04] come here and um he passed away this
[1:19:08] morning um early this
[1:19:11] morning and but I was I was very proud
[1:19:14] of our family I mean our church family
[1:19:18] every one of our deacons were
[1:19:20] there these were not members of our
[1:19:23] church the the Roberts family we love
[1:19:25] them dearly but they're not the ones
[1:19:27] that we see every every time we come
[1:19:30] they're not the ones that we are just a
[1:19:31] second brother John they are not the
[1:19:33] ones that
[1:19:34] we um serve
[1:19:37] normally but everyone of our deacons was
[1:19:41] there every one of us every brother
[1:19:44] Aaron Brother Lyle brother Jordan
[1:19:49] serving think about this Good Samaritan
[1:19:51] brother uh but they were there as
[1:19:54] wonderful it was it was a very very
[1:19:58] sweet thing take looking after this man
[1:20:03] and his family and the same very same
[1:20:07] spirit that is when the the Good
[1:20:12] Samaritan and and to help and it was
[1:20:15] just it was beautiful I was I was very
[1:20:18] very
[1:20:19] proud
[1:20:22] and brother brother Ron was telling me
[1:20:25] the
[1:20:26] story about he was when he was
[1:20:31] um he was
[1:20:34] driving and he
[1:20:38] uh he drove a
[1:20:40] truck and he looked in his rearview
[1:20:43] mirror and he sees a car go over the
[1:20:47] guard rail and down into a
[1:20:51] ravine brother Ron Slams on his brakes
[1:20:55] he gets out he runs down to to help this
[1:20:59] person and he um he uh goes down there
[1:21:06] and he gets he gets into the car and and
[1:21:09] the lady has a cut artery in her leg
[1:21:14] brother Ron puts his hand in pressure
[1:21:16] over the artery trying to trying to stop
[1:21:19] the bleeding and and comforting her and
[1:21:22] she asked brother Ron she says am I
[1:21:23] going to die
[1:21:26] and brother Ron says no he says I'm here
[1:21:29] everything's going to be okay and he end
[1:21:32] up saving the lady a Good
[1:21:35] Samaritan taking his time he could have
[1:21:39] just kept going and that's what the
[1:21:40] world teaches us today just keep going
[1:21:42] just keep running just keep
[1:21:44] moving keep doing yourself keep serving
[1:21:47] yourself keep keep
[1:21:51] keep don't worry about anybody else
[1:21:55] and the the world teaches us that don't
[1:21:57] put your don't put your neck on the line
[1:22:01] because you could get sued don't put
[1:22:03] your neck on the line because you could
[1:22:04] get hurt they teach most people in in
[1:22:07] the um in the in the hospitals or
[1:22:09] wherever they are don't don't fight just
[1:22:13] run away don't care about somebody else
[1:22:15] if somebody else is getting hurt just
[1:22:16] run and get away save yourself and
[1:22:19] that's what the world teaches us today
[1:22:21] there's no
[1:22:23] courage there's no love for someone
[1:22:27] else what about the
[1:22:30] pastors that walk on the other side of
[1:22:33] the road and and provide no correction
[1:22:35] to the church they just feel maybe
[1:22:37] preach it maybe a feel-good
[1:22:39] service you know you're fine because
[1:22:41] you're a Believer you're fine because of
[1:22:44] the way you dress you're fine because of
[1:22:46] where you go to church you're fine
[1:22:47] because God knows God knows
[1:22:50] you and that Pastor just let me walk on
[1:22:53] the other side of the road
[1:22:55] and you see the people that they're not
[1:22:57] where they should
[1:23:01] be don't
[1:23:03] worry about living in sin don't worry
[1:23:06] about gossiping don't worry about being
[1:23:09] a part of a part of a church you're a
[1:23:11] good person don't worry about cussing
[1:23:13] don't worry about lying don't worry
[1:23:14] about immorality don't worry about
[1:23:16] paying ties oh that's just Old Testament
[1:23:18] don't worry about not giving your time
[1:23:20] to serve others if you have a
[1:23:22] relationship with God don't worry about
[1:23:24] those things I'll just walk on the other
[1:23:26] side of the
[1:23:28] road and it is offensive many times the
[1:23:31] gospel
[1:23:33] is let me as a pastor walk on the other
[1:23:36] side of the road let me as a levite walk
[1:23:37] on the other side of the road let me as
[1:23:39] a parent walk on the other side of the
[1:23:41] road let me as a friend walk on the
[1:23:43] other side of the road let me as a
[1:23:45] Christian walk on the other side of the
[1:23:52] road back to verse 36
[1:23:55] six which now of these thing of which
[1:23:59] now of these three thinkest thou was na
[1:24:03] was neighbor unto him that fell among
[1:24:06] the
[1:24:07] thieves and he said well the one that
[1:24:10] showed Mercy on him and Jesus said unto
[1:24:13] him go and do thou
[1:24:16] likewise remember the lawyer's origin
[1:24:19] his original question was how can I
[1:24:21] receive eternal
[1:24:23] life the
[1:24:25] answer from God in flesh was a simple
[1:24:29] story and an ended which which one of
[1:24:31] these three three people the priest the
[1:24:33] levite and the Samaritan which one was a
[1:24:35] neighbor to the Jew on the road and he
[1:24:38] answered he that showed mercy and Jesus
[1:24:40] said now you go and you do the
[1:24:43] same that's the simpleness the
[1:24:46] Simplicity of God the Simplicity of the
[1:24:50] Gospel we want to go really deep we want
[1:24:53] to really understand understand all of
[1:24:54] these things but if we would just
[1:24:56] understand what Jesus taught and the
[1:24:58] love that he
[1:25:00] showed
[1:25:01] then we'll get
[1:25:03] there and not only will we get there we
[1:25:06] will bring other people with us the
[1:25:09] musicians can come and we'll
[1:25:17] close we don't predict the outcomes of
[1:25:19] our Good
[1:25:21] Deeds but we look at the task at hand
[1:25:25] hand and we do the task because it helps
[1:25:28] someone brother Josiah when he prayed
[1:25:31] for this
[1:25:33] man he prayed in private and didn't tell
[1:25:35] anyone and then God answered the prayer
[1:25:38] when brother Ed when he
[1:25:40] prayed God answered his prayer and
[1:25:42] everybody in I 10
[1:25:45] benefited and nothing comes without a
[1:25:48] sacrifice nothing good comes it takes
[1:25:52] our time it takes our love it takes
[1:25:54] whatever we can do it takes that to
[1:25:58] truly do
[1:26:00] something you know brother and sisters
[1:26:03] when we when it comes to this Good
[1:26:06] Samaritan
[1:26:08] we look at this
[1:26:11] story read
[1:26:13] it read why Jesus said the the the man
[1:26:18] came to Jesus and he's like hey he says
[1:26:21] and he's he's he's tempting him and he
[1:26:23] wants to get in this argument and he
[1:26:25] wants to maybe get in a theological
[1:26:27] argument or he he asks this leading
[1:26:29] question and he says well what do I have
[1:26:31] to do to inherit eternal life and that's
[1:26:33] the greatest question that anyone can
[1:26:35] have we should get on our knees and say
[1:26:37] Lord what do I need to do to inherit
[1:26:39] eternal life I want to be there on that
[1:26:42] day I want my family to be there I want
[1:26:44] my friends to be there what do I need to
[1:26:46] do so then I could help
[1:26:48] them that's the most important question
[1:26:52] and it's not meant to be a religious the
[1:26:54] theological discussion as so many times
[1:26:57] it happens and that's what this man
[1:26:58] wanted he wanted this
[1:27:01] Theology and he missed the whole thing I
[1:27:04] talked about the Seven Seals the Seven
[1:27:07] Seals inside the Seven Seals is what
[1:27:10] matters the book of
[1:27:13] redemption I want to be
[1:27:16] there I want those seals those seals are
[1:27:19] broken by the Lamb of God and there I am
[1:27:24] in that book praise God for
[1:27:28] that and we talk about this story of
[1:27:33] this Good
[1:27:34] Samaritan Jesus said this is eternal
[1:27:37] life who was who was the good who is the
[1:27:40] neighbor to this man who was the
[1:27:45] neighbor that's one what that received
[1:27:49] eternal life wasn't even
[1:27:52] a if we were all Jews je in here it
[1:27:55] wasn't even a believer we would call but
[1:27:58] it was the one that really did it it was
[1:28:00] the one that really acted on what Jesus
[1:28:03] said
[1:28:05] Amen Brother John I believe you acted on
[1:28:09] what Jesus
[1:28:10] said I believe you acted and what God
[1:28:13] laid on your heart and you did it at the
[1:28:15] perfect time you had no
[1:28:17] idea that brother Dan was going to pass
[1:28:20] away do you see how God laid it on our
[1:28:23] brother's heart
[1:28:25] to do this and
[1:28:28] now we all benefit and the family
[1:28:33] benefits
[1:28:35] from the leading of the Lord on one
[1:28:37] person one Good Samaritan brother just
