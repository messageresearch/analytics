[40:52] evening thank you and Welcome to our
[40:54] Wednesday night bible study I'm excited
[40:58] tonight just a little reminder I've I've
[41:01] been printing out these little Guides of
[41:03] the scriptures and some of the images
[41:05] that we do and they're in the back there
[41:07] from uh two weeks ago and from last week
[41:09] as well as from tonight so if you want
[41:12] one as a little reminder or something as
[41:14] you go there they're in the back and
[41:16] there's no charge
[41:22] so we're investigating as you know the
[41:26] life of Joseph and some of the many
[41:28] lessons that it holds for us but before
[41:31] we start I need to
[41:33] apologize I made a statement last time I
[41:36] was showing a slide of a 4,000 year old
[41:39] model of a Greenery and I made a comment
[41:41] about government workers a sort of a
[41:43] disparaging statement I was really
[41:46] thinking of workplace structure but
[41:49] either way the comment was inappropriate
[41:53] and potentially offensive so I am sorry
[41:58] and I I mean that to whom those I may
[42:01] have offended please forgive me it was
[42:03] not my
[42:06] intent as we resume our study let's join
[42:09] together in
[42:11] prayer Lord Jesus
[42:14] it's it's an awesome
[42:17] responsibility we just sang Lord about
[42:21] you gave your life blood you came down
[42:23] from heaven you made a way for each of
[42:25] us and each person that standing that
[42:28] I'm facing this evening and that's
[42:29] facing me has been purchased by your
[42:32] blood they are a part of you and Lord it
[42:39] is it's not something to be taken
[42:42] lightly Lord I pray that this evening
[42:45] Lord that you would guard my lips guard
[42:49] the ears of everyone that hears Lord
[42:51] anyone that's streaming or may see at
[42:53] some future time Lord that nothing be
[42:56] said that offensive nothing be said Lord
[42:59] that that it's okay if it offends the
[43:01] devil but Lord we don't want to offend
[43:03] your people we don't want to offend you
[43:05] so Lord I just pray this evening Lord
[43:08] that you'd help us as we open this story
[43:11] and continue in in in Joseph Lord these
[43:14] little these little grains of sand that
[43:17] you left Lord that that that at some
[43:19] future time we could look back and we
[43:21] could see your hand we can know that you
[43:23] are truly the same yesterday and today
[43:27] and will be forever Lord we commit
[43:30] ourselves once more into your hands
[43:32] thank you forgive us where we fall short
[43:34] forgive us of our sin Lord our
[43:36] shortcomings and help us to draw closer
[43:38] to you to one another and live a life
[43:41] that's pleasing to you we thank you in
[43:44] Jesus precious name
[43:48] amen last time we saw that Joseph was
[43:52] sold into slavery in Piper's house after
[43:55] some years proving his ability and
[43:59] integrity potier had Advanced Joseph to
[44:01] become his chief operating officer he
[44:04] was then serving in Piper's
[44:06] house Piper's wife had been actively
[44:09] trying to seduce him she'd set a trap
[44:11] for him and as he escaped she managed to
[44:14] rip off his
[44:15] Kilt potier came home from work she
[44:18] confronted him with a tale about Joseph
[44:20] trying to force himself on her it's a
[44:22] lie of course as we demonstrated last
[44:25] time with that as background let's read
[44:28] our opening verses for this evening
[44:31] please turn to Romans chapter
[44:35] 8 I wonder if Paul was thinking of
[44:38] Joseph when he penned this Paul wrote we
[44:42] know we don't guess there's no doubt
[44:46] here we know that all things work
[44:49] together for good to them that love God
[44:53] to them that are called according to his
[44:56] purpose
[44:58] purpose he might have been looking back
[45:00] and thinking Joseph hang on brother hang
[45:03] on it's working together for good
[45:06] because it's clear that you love God and
[45:09] it's clear that you are called Joseph
[45:13] was not in a happy place let's go to
[45:16] Genesis chapter
[45:17] 39 just before we're
[45:20] seated just a review to pick up where we
[45:23] were and Mrs P spake unto potier
[45:26] according to these word
[45:28] saying the Hebrew servant which I
[45:31] brought unto us it came in unto me to
[45:34] mock me what happened it's all your
[45:37] fault biper you brought this slave in
[45:41] our house and made him your personal
[45:43] servant look what he did when he saw his
[45:45] chest he came on to me that nasty filthy
[45:49] Hebrew it came to pass as I screamed for
[45:53] help he left his garment with me and out
[45:57] of the
[45:59] house and it came to pass when Joseph's
[46:02] Master heard the words of his wife which
[46:04] he spake unto him saying after this
[46:06] matter did th servant to me that his
[46:09] wrath was kindled and Joseph Master
[46:11] potier took him and please be seated
[46:30] okay what's pfer going to
[46:32] do how's Joseph going to explain
[46:36] things can he avoid execution the
[46:39] undoubted result of a slave attacking
[46:41] the wife of a high Egyptian
[46:44] official look again at verse
[46:47] 19 Piper's wrath was kindled he's
[46:51] burning with anger his wrath is ignited
[46:54] and Joseph Master took him and put him
[46:57] in the prison a place where the king's
[47:01] prisoners what does that mean King's
[47:04] prisoners were bound or
[47:09] confined there's so much going on in
[47:12] just these two
[47:14] verses first potier didn't execute
[47:18] Joseph as the captain of the Guard he's
[47:21] also the chief executioner in ancient
[47:23] times people were more often executed or
[47:26] beaten or or maimed than imprisoned cost
[47:30] money to run a prison it costs nothing
[47:32] to
[47:33] execute you you probably notice when we
[47:35] went through Leviticus numbers and
[47:37] Deuteronomy the punishments for breaking
[47:39] the law were fines or beatings or
[47:44] execution there's no passage that says
[47:47] if you do so and so then incarcerate
[47:49] this person for X number of days weeks
[47:51] or months and then turn them
[47:53] loose that's not how it worked the
[47:56] King's prisoners were those who had
[47:59] offended Pharaoh the king in some way
[48:03] they'd usually be fairly high ranking
[48:06] people Pharaoh was being careful to not
[48:10] execute them until he was satisfied that
[48:12] they were guilty of something more than
[48:14] displeasing him in some minor way and
[48:17] this would give time for potier or his
[48:19] people to investigate the matter report
[48:22] back or or allow Pharaoh's temper to
[48:24] cool off and find some face safe giving
[48:27] way to release or reinstate the
[48:31] detainee later in the Bible we begin to
[48:34] see prisons literally captive houses in
[48:37] other and later cultures such as the
[48:39] Philistines During the period of the
[48:41] judges some 500 to 900 years after
[48:45] Joseph but this
[48:47] prison this prison is unique in all the
[48:52] Bible the adjective to describe it is
[48:55] called the round
[48:57] house it's the only prison or even
[49:00] building in the Bible that's described
[49:02] this way and the description is
[49:05] consistent whenever this prison is
[49:07] mentioned it's always called The
[49:10] Roundhouse and it's the only one that's
[49:13] ever called The Roundhouse and that
[49:15] particular adjective round that
[49:17] particular Hebrew word is used in the
[49:20] entire Bible and only one other
[49:25] instance it's in the Song of Songs when
[49:27] Solomon is describing his Lover's belly
[49:30] button
[49:32] seriously so the particular use the
[49:35] peculiar use of this particular Hebrew
[49:37] word describing round tells us it was
[49:40] essentially a circular
[49:42] pit it may have been under pifer's house
[49:45] based on a later verse telling us the
[49:47] prison was in his house so under his
[49:50] house are just nearby to prevent escape
[49:52] and make it secure roundhouse is most
[49:55] likely in the form of a pit an
[49:58] underground Silo we'll see another clue
[50:00] confirming this perspective in in
[50:02] chapter
[50:04] 40 uh this is a photo I took of an area
[50:08] of Christian catacombs in Alexandria
[50:10] Egypt they date to the first century
[50:12] well after Joseph's time it's not a
[50:15] prison and it's from a later era but you
[50:18] get the
[50:19] idea and by the way in the window on the
[50:22] right you can see my sweetie speaking to
[50:24] Joseph not the biblical J Joseph but our
[50:27] guide in this part of Egypt who was a
[50:29] Christian gentleman named Joseph and how
[50:32] do you know a Christian in Egypt when
[50:34] they're a young child rather than
[50:36] baptizing them I don't know if the if
[50:38] that Orthodox Church does or not but
[50:40] there's a tattoo in the shape of a very
[50:42] particular kind of cross that is put on
[50:44] the child when they're very young and as
[50:46] you go through life you're marked as a
[50:51] Christian Joseph was a
[50:53] Christian well back to Jacob's Joseph
[50:56] from a pit to slavery to
[51:00] coo and back to a
[51:04] pit why would Piper not simply execute
[51:07] him anyone have an
[51:10] idea because he knows
[51:13] Joseph he's observed him for years he
[51:16] knows his Integrity he knows Joseph is
[51:19] Innocent but he's sent to prison he's
[51:22] not executed he's not beaten he's not
[51:25] tortured he's not sold to somebody else
[51:29] he's confined but given the run of the
[51:32] prison just like he was pifer's coo in
[51:35] his Palace he quickly becomes the
[51:38] prison's Chief Operating
[51:41] Officer another reason potier knows his
[51:45] wife and knows she's
[51:48] guilty oh are you sure he attacked
[51:54] you yes of course how could you even ask
[51:58] such a
[51:59] thing well I've investigated a lot of
[52:03] sexual assault cases uh you see this
[52:05] tear Joseph would not have worn a torn
[52:08] Kilt to work yet this Kilt is torn
[52:11] indicating it was violently
[52:14] removed and even if not torn the Garment
[52:17] is usually stripped off from the victim
[52:20] not the perpetrator of the
[52:24] attack but she's effectively pardoned
[52:28] why she's likely the daughter of an
[52:31] influential person in Pharaoh's Court
[52:33] we'll see that Pharaoh will present a
[52:35] wife to Joseph it's a daughter of an
[52:36] important priest if potier punishes Mrs
[52:40] P it might offend some very powerful
[52:42] people it it might even reflect poorly
[52:45] on the Judgment of pharaoh if he was
[52:47] involved in matchmaking it all on this
[52:50] so Piper is burning with anger towards
[52:55] Mrs P not towards
[52:58] Joseph and perhaps to his own
[53:00] predicament and frustration if he were
[53:03] burning with anger at Joseph he would
[53:04] have executed him he's replaceable he's
[53:07] a Hebrew slave see or not Joseph is a
[53:11] foreigner and he's a Hebrew we'll see
[53:14] the significance of that
[53:17] later but neither can he ignore what
[53:19] happened so he saves face by punishing
[53:24] Joseph in effect putting him in
[53:27] uh a protective custody his regard for
[53:30] Joseph is clear because he's put in the
[53:34] place where the king's prisoners were
[53:37] confined and did you notice how we got
[53:39] into this
[53:40] pit in chapter 37 his brothers stripped
[53:44] him of His Garment and his authority
[53:47] confined him in a pit a sister that
[53:50] became his prison once again he is
[53:53] stripped of His Garment and his
[53:55] authority and confined in a pit designed
[53:59] to be a
[54:01] prison deja vu all over
[54:04] again well let's read the final
[54:07] verse of chapter
[54:11] 39 Joseph's Master Piper took him put
[54:15] him into the prison a place where the
[54:17] king's prisoners were bound not tied up
[54:19] but confined and he was there in the
[54:22] prison but the Lord was with
[54:28] Joseph the Lord showed him Mercy the
[54:32] lord gave him favor in the sight of The
[54:35] Keeper of the prison the the the warden
[54:37] another one of Piper's men remember we
[54:41] read in Psalm 105 the Lord had sent
[54:45] Joseph to Egypt for a
[54:49] reason and The Keeper of the prison
[54:52] committed to Joseph's hand all the
[54:54] prisoners that were in the prison and
[54:56] whatsoever they did there he was the
[54:58] doer of it the keeper of the prison
[55:00] looked not to anything that was under
[55:02] his hand because the Lord was with
[55:05] Joseph and that which he did the Lord
[55:08] made it to
[55:09] prosper here in just three
[55:13] verses we're told three times that the
[55:17] Lord was with Joseph and the Lord made
[55:21] him successful remember in chapter 37
[55:24] the Lord isn't mentioned once yet we saw
[55:26] his s chapter 39 started with Joseph
[55:29] being demoted from a favorite son to a
[55:31] slave it ends with him being demoted
[55:33] from a successful slave to a prisoner
[55:36] and back into a
[55:38] pit the first pit in Dothan he was held
[55:42] until just the right moment when the
[55:45] ishmaelites came by and this pit you'll
[55:48] see he'll also be held until just the
[55:52] right
[55:53] moment I think the Lord's influence in
[55:56] chapter 39 is emphasized because from
[55:58] our human perspective Joseph is being
[56:01] mistreated continually
[56:04] suffering yet really it is the Lord that
[56:07] is guiding it
[56:09] all and as we'll see in the best
[56:12] possible way for the circumstances and
[56:16] culture of that time and
[56:19] place look at the parallels in this
[56:21] chapter how it begins and ends uh the
[56:24] Lord was with Joseph and showed him Mery
[56:26] that's verse 21 the end of the chapter
[56:29] but the beginning of the chapter the
[56:30] Lord was with Joseph he was a prosperous
[56:32] man he was in the house of his master
[56:34] the
[56:35] Egyptian gave him favor in the sight of
[56:37] The Keeper of the prison Joseph found
[56:39] Grace in Piper's sight and served him
[56:42] The Keeper of the prison committed to
[56:43] Joseph's hand all the prisoners that
[56:45] were in the prison potier all that he
[56:48] had he put into his hand whatsoever they
[56:51] did there he was the doer of it he made
[56:53] him overseer over his house The Keeper
[56:56] of the prison looked not to anything
[56:58] that was under his hand Piper he left
[57:01] all that he had in Joseph's
[57:03] hand why because the Lord was with him
[57:07] and that which he did the Lord made it
[57:09] to prosper and earlier his master saw
[57:12] that the Lord was with him and that the
[57:14] Lord made all that he did to prosper in
[57:16] his hand the chapter begins and ends the
[57:20] same way I I
[57:22] wonder Isaiah knew this story Isaiah
[57:25] read these scriptures I wonder if he was
[57:27] meditating on this when he wrote in
[57:29] Isaiah
[57:31] 559 as the heavens are higher than the
[57:34] earth so are my ways higher than your
[57:38] ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
[57:43] amen with Joseph now unfairly
[57:46] incarcerated we move on to chapter 40
[57:50] Joseph has been in prison for a while
[57:52] long enough to advance in responsibility
[57:55] and have the entire prison running
[57:57] smoothly for its VIP
[58:00] detainees he's likely been there close
[58:02] to a year don't really know but he spent
[58:05] perhaps a decade in service to potier
[58:07] until Mrs P took his Kilt regardless of
[58:11] how the time is divided Joseph has been
[58:13] in Egypt for 11
[58:16] years he was taken at age
[58:18] 17 he is now 28 years old Senor threat 2
[58:25] has been
[58:26] the Pharaoh on the throne for nine or 10
[58:31] years Genesis 40 verse one it came to
[58:37] pass after these things that the butler
[58:40] most translations use the term cupbearer
[58:43] of the king of Egypt and his Baker had
[58:46] offended their lord king of Egypt we
[58:50] don't know what the offense is we can
[58:52] surmise something here Pharaoh was wroth
[58:55] he was angry angry against these two of
[58:57] his officers against the chief of the
[58:59] Butlers and the chief of the
[59:03] Bakers these are senior officials in the
[59:06] Royal household the butler would taste
[59:08] every drink before handing it to Pharaoh
[59:11] which also put him in a position to
[59:13] poison the king similarly the baker
[59:15] provided food for the king and likewise
[59:19] would be in a position to poison
[59:21] him can't be too careful it's likely
[59:25] perhaps somehow now that Pharaoh became
[59:27] suspicious of these two men they
[59:28] offended him in some way maybe he became
[59:31] aware of a rumor that there's a plot to
[59:33] kill him by poisoning so off to
[59:36] detention a royal timeout until the
[59:39] matter can be investigated oh potier is
[59:42] probably going to be involved after all
[59:44] men you can trust with your life are
[59:47] hard to
[59:50] replace and Pharaoh put them the Butler
[59:53] and the baker in ward in detention in
[59:55] the what
[59:57] House of whom the captain of the Guard
[1:00:02] potier entered the prison the place
[1:00:04] where Joseph was bound this prison is
[1:00:07] associated with his house it's in the
[1:00:08] house or probably under the
[1:00:11] house these guys are are bound but it
[1:00:14] doesn't mean they're tied up it simply
[1:00:15] means that they're incarcerated the The
[1:00:17] Roundhouse prison was on PO ofer's
[1:00:20] estate possibly a basement or sub
[1:00:22] basement of his Palace the text is
[1:00:24] clearer the prison was in his
[1:00:27] house and the captain of the Guard
[1:00:30] potier charged Joseph with them he
[1:00:33] assigned them to Joseph and he served
[1:00:35] them he became their attendant notice
[1:00:37] it's not the keeper of the prison that
[1:00:38] ensured Joseph looked after these two it
[1:00:41] was potterer
[1:00:43] himself and they continued a season in
[1:00:45] Ward long enough for the investigation
[1:00:48] whatever it was that offended phoh to be
[1:00:52] completed and they Dreamed a Dream both
[1:00:55] of them each man his dream in one night
[1:00:57] and in the same night each man according
[1:01:00] to the interpretation of his dream the
[1:01:02] the Butler and the baker of the king of
[1:01:04] Egypt which were Bound in the
[1:01:07] prison and Joseph came in unto them in
[1:01:10] the morning and looked upon them and
[1:01:14] behold they were sad more so than than
[1:01:19] normal and he asked Pharaoh's officers
[1:01:22] the the the cup Bearer and the baker
[1:01:25] that were were with him in the ward of
[1:01:27] his Lord's Piper's house
[1:01:30] saying wherefore look you so sadly
[1:01:34] today cheer up guys I'm responsible for
[1:01:37] looking after you I don't want you
[1:01:39] desponded if there's anything I can do
[1:01:41] to help apart from being confined here
[1:01:43] for a while can't do anything about that
[1:01:45] but but what's the matter why such long
[1:01:49] faces and they said unto him we have
[1:01:53] each Dreamed a Dream
[1:01:56] vivid enough to remember it in detail
[1:01:58] after waking up this
[1:02:00] morning and there's no interpreter of
[1:02:04] it in Egypt at that time there was a
[1:02:09] specific group of people whose job it
[1:02:11] was to interpret
[1:02:13] dreams they were part of the Royal Court
[1:02:18] we'll see this they had special manuals
[1:02:22] that they used for this purpose dreams
[1:02:24] were often considered Ed Omens
[1:02:27] Communications from the spirit world
[1:02:30] these men were familiar with the court
[1:02:32] and how all of this worked they had no
[1:02:34] access to an official interpreter of
[1:02:37] dreams and being in prison they became
[1:02:40] even more Melancholy than
[1:02:44] usual Joseph said unto
[1:02:47] them do not interpretations belong to
[1:02:51] God tell me your dreams
[1:02:57] the chief Butler told his dream to
[1:03:00] Joseph and said to him in my dream
[1:03:04] Behold a Vine was before me and in the
[1:03:08] vine were three branches and it was
[1:03:11] though it budded and her Blossom shot
[1:03:13] forth and the clusters of brought forth
[1:03:15] ripe
[1:03:16] grapes and and Pharaoh's cup was in my
[1:03:19] hand and I took the grapes and pressed
[1:03:22] them into Pharaoh's
[1:03:24] cup and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's
[1:03:28] hand and Joseph
[1:03:32] said
[1:03:34] oh you're going to love it this is the
[1:03:36] interpretation of this the three
[1:03:38] branches represent three days within
[1:03:42] three days Pharaoh will lift up your
[1:03:44] head from here and restore you into your
[1:03:47] place in the Royal Court you shall
[1:03:49] deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand
[1:03:51] after the former manner when when you
[1:03:53] were his Butler
[1:03:56] but think on me when it should be well
[1:03:59] with thee show kindness I pray thee unto
[1:04:01] me make mention of me unto Pho and and
[1:04:04] bring me out of this house for indeed I
[1:04:07] was
[1:04:08] stolen I did nothing wrong I wasn't
[1:04:11] being punished for some crime I was
[1:04:13] stolen away out of the land of the
[1:04:15] Hebrews and here in in Egypt and in
[1:04:18] Piper's house also I've done nothing
[1:04:20] they should put me into this
[1:04:22] dungeon not just prison dungeon
[1:04:27] again speaking of it being an
[1:04:28] underground location the Hebrew word
[1:04:30] translated dungeon here literally means
[1:04:33] boore as in as in a pit or are you ready
[1:04:38] a
[1:04:39] sistern in fact it's the identical word
[1:04:42] used in chapter 37 translated his pit
[1:04:45] where Joseph was briefly imprisoned by
[1:04:48] his
[1:04:50] brothers Joseph has come full circle
[1:04:53] from a pit and Dothan
[1:04:55] to a pit in
[1:04:57] Egypt and his appeal to the cup Bearer
[1:05:00] is also showing Joseph's growing sense
[1:05:03] of Despair ever getting out of his
[1:05:05] situation pfer is never going to let me
[1:05:07] out of here but but maybe maybe the Lord
[1:05:10] worked it out for this guy to come here
[1:05:12] and and he'll be my ticket
[1:05:14] out and it will turn out that that's
[1:05:17] exactly what happened and will happen
[1:05:20] just not in the way he probably
[1:05:24] imagined when the chief Baker saw that
[1:05:28] the interpretation was good notice he he
[1:05:31] waited he hesitated he he didn't go
[1:05:34] first
[1:05:35] why maybe no particular reason or maybe
[1:05:39] he knew the palace Intrigue that put
[1:05:42] them both there was true maybe he was
[1:05:45] guilty in some sort of plot to poison
[1:05:47] Pharaoh we don't know but when he saw
[1:05:51] the interpretation was good he said unto
[1:05:52] Joseph I also was in my my dream and
[1:05:56] behold I had three white baskets on my
[1:06:00] head and in the uppermost basket there
[1:06:02] was all manner of Bak Meats for
[1:06:05] pharaoh and the birds did eat them out
[1:06:07] of the basket on my
[1:06:11] head and
[1:06:15] Joseph perhaps after a pause quietly
[1:06:20] with
[1:06:21] compassion
[1:06:23] sadness answered and said
[1:06:29] this is the interpretation of your
[1:06:31] dream the three baskets are are three
[1:06:34] days and the baker's thinking oh just
[1:06:37] like the Butlers so far so good I'm
[1:06:40] gonna get away with
[1:06:42] this yet within three
[1:06:44] days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from
[1:06:47] off
[1:06:48] thee oops not so
[1:06:51] good and shall hang thee on a tree
[1:06:53] literally impale you on a wooden
[1:06:56] pole and the birds shall eat thy flesh
[1:07:01] from off thee oh very bad the butler is
[1:07:06] hoping Joseph is correct the baker not
[1:07:09] so
[1:07:11] much it came to pass on the third day
[1:07:15] which was Pharaoh's birthday that
[1:07:18] Pharaoh made a feast unto all his
[1:07:19] servants and he lifted up the head of
[1:07:21] the chief Butler and the chief Baker
[1:07:23] among his servants this phrase lifted up
[1:07:25] in Hebrew occurs very
[1:07:29] often so he brought them out of prison
[1:07:31] he probably pointed the mountain made a
[1:07:34] speech you know there was a a plot to
[1:07:36] poison me He restored the chief Butler
[1:07:40] unto his Butlers ship again he gave the
[1:07:43] cup into Pharaoh's hand he was
[1:07:46] innocent but he hanged impaled the chief
[1:07:50] Butler he was guilty of whatever the
[1:07:53] offense was maybe why he was hesitant to
[1:07:56] share his dream as Joseph had
[1:07:58] interpreted to
[1:08:03] them yet did not the chief Butler
[1:08:07] remember
[1:08:08] Joseph but forgot
[1:08:12] him after all Joseph was was that his
[1:08:15] name just a Hebrew slave he had to be
[1:08:18] guilty of something to be in the prison
[1:08:21] everyone in prison claims to be innocent
[1:08:23] uh he's not really a dream inter
[1:08:26] lucky guess he he he lacks of training
[1:08:28] he doesn't even have the manual probably
[1:08:29] couldn't even read it if he
[1:08:31] did I'm sure glad to be out of detention
[1:08:34] I better get back to
[1:08:36] work which wine will Pharaoh prefer with
[1:08:38] his
[1:08:39] duck or or maybe he was just so occupied
[1:08:43] with his work being reunited with his
[1:08:46] family and wanting to forget he was ever
[1:08:48] sent to the prison that he simply forgot
[1:08:52] the prison
[1:08:53] worker and you can imagine imagine
[1:08:56] Joseph word get back to him the baker
[1:08:58] was executed the butler is back on the
[1:09:00] job
[1:09:01] Hallelujah I'm Vindicated any day now
[1:09:04] they'll come and get me I can hardly
[1:09:07] wait to get out of
[1:09:09] here a week
[1:09:12] passes he's just busy maybe he has to
[1:09:15] wait for the right moment to to get
[1:09:16] pharaoh to listen to him about
[1:09:19] me a month
[1:09:22] passes why hasn't anyone come to release
[1:09:24] me sure surely the butler must remember
[1:09:27] I I cheered him up I took really good
[1:09:29] care of him while he was here especially
[1:09:31] those last three days and the dream
[1:09:33] interpretations were specific and
[1:09:36] spoton a year
[1:09:41] passes this is Pharaoh's birthday the
[1:09:44] anniversary of the butler being restored
[1:09:46] surely he'll remember of pharaoh now and
[1:09:48] I'll finally get out of
[1:09:50] here and the next day I'll never get out
[1:09:55] of here here I wish I'd never been born
[1:09:57] this is just too much it's so
[1:10:02] unfair another lesson for
[1:10:04] us we need to
[1:10:06] remember to put our ultimate hope not in
[1:10:10] our fellow
[1:10:11] inmates but in the
[1:10:14] Lord we're often told that Joseph is a a
[1:10:18] type a model of Jesus do you see some
[1:10:22] parallels here consider
[1:10:25] these two men are in prison with Joseph
[1:10:28] they're conversing with him and of the
[1:10:31] two with Joseph one will received life
[1:10:35] the other
[1:10:36] death and not just
[1:10:39] death but Eternal
[1:10:42] death little
[1:10:45] sidebar did you ever
[1:10:47] wonder why Egypt never created an Empire
[1:10:51] they'd send their army out go on raids
[1:10:53] take gold take stuff slaves whatever and
[1:10:56] they'd come back to Egypt they didn't
[1:10:59] set up colonies they were right on the
[1:11:01] Mediterranean but they did not become a
[1:11:03] nation that did a lot of shipping they
[1:11:06] had to take a boat someplace and get on
[1:11:08] the Nile put up the sail you go up the
[1:11:10] Nile take down the sail you go down the
[1:11:12] nail it doesn't take a lot of skillful
[1:11:14] seamanship in order to handle going up
[1:11:16] and down the river and if they went
[1:11:18] across into the Sinai across the the Red
[1:11:20] Sea there to some of the mines they had
[1:11:22] they were adjacent to Egypt they never
[1:11:25] strayed from Egypt for any length of
[1:11:28] time
[1:11:31] why in the religion of Egypt your body
[1:11:36] had to be buried in Egypt and your body
[1:11:41] had to be whole for you to have a chance
[1:11:44] of surviving in the afterlife if your
[1:11:47] body somehow was dismembered all the
[1:11:49] pieces had to be buried together that's
[1:11:52] why such care was taken to mummify by
[1:11:55] the bodies of the deceased that could
[1:11:57] afford it and the reason that mummies
[1:11:59] were buried with what they called
[1:12:00] canopic jars containing the removed
[1:12:03] organs the you know the the liver and
[1:12:06] the lungs and the heart and whatever
[1:12:07] those four jars that they would have but
[1:12:09] they always kept them with the body
[1:12:10] because they had to be buried
[1:12:12] together but the baker would be
[1:12:15] decapitated his body impaled on a pole
[1:12:18] for the birds to eat no hope of
[1:12:21] afterlife for him it wasn't just
[1:12:24] condemned and killed and buried cut off
[1:12:27] for eternity this is Extreme punishment
[1:12:31] Eternal and now a parallel and you know
[1:12:35] this one brother brandom shared it in
[1:12:37] the six-fold purpose of Gabriel's
[1:12:39] instructions to Daniel which brother
[1:12:41] Daniel asked us all to hear last
[1:12:42] September so you're familiar with this
[1:12:44] one two men are crucified with Jesus
[1:12:48] they're conversing with him and of the
[1:12:51] two with Jesus one will receive life
[1:12:54] this day will you be with me in Paradise
[1:12:57] the other death we're familiar with that
[1:13:00] parallel but here's another
[1:13:03] one consider this one Jesus at the Last
[1:13:06] Supper Matthew 26 as they were eating
[1:13:09] Jesus Took bread and blessed it and
[1:13:11] break it and gave it to the disciples
[1:13:13] and said take eat this is my body and he
[1:13:17] took the cup and gave thanks and gave it
[1:13:18] to them saying drink ye all of it for
[1:13:21] this is my blood of the new testament
[1:13:24] which is shed for me many for the
[1:13:26] remission of
[1:13:28] sins and Paul expands this just a bit
[1:13:30] for us in 1 Corinthians 11 the Lord
[1:13:33] Jesus the same night in which he was
[1:13:36] betrayed took bread and when he had
[1:13:39] given thanks he break it and said take
[1:13:41] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:13:44] you this do in remembrance of me broken
[1:13:48] for you how often was his body broken
[1:13:51] for you once and the baker bread would
[1:13:56] have his body broken and
[1:13:59] consumed
[1:14:01] once after the same manner also he took
[1:14:04] the cup when he had Sut saying this cup
[1:14:06] is the New Testament in my blood this do
[1:14:09] is of as you drink it in remembrance of
[1:14:13] me in remembrance of Me Jesus says
[1:14:15] you'll drink this many times and when
[1:14:19] you do every time remember me and what
[1:14:23] does Joseph ask the butler the one who
[1:14:25] handles the cup many times remember
[1:14:30] me we keep looking for Jesus in the Old
[1:14:33] Testament he's not hard to find because
[1:14:36] he's everywhere in it even in the prison
[1:14:39] with Joseph as he talks to the two other
[1:14:42] inmates interprets their dreams three
[1:14:45] days in a pit before restoration to
[1:14:49] life speaking of Joseph let's get back
[1:14:52] to
[1:14:53] Genesis we finished chap chapter 40 and
[1:14:56] we're now at
[1:14:58] 41 411 it came to pass at the end of two
[1:15:02] full years that Pharaoh
[1:15:04] dreamed two
[1:15:07] years look in your Bibles not your
[1:15:10] iPad not your phone app but if you have
[1:15:14] one a physical
[1:15:18] Bible I'll put another slide on the
[1:15:20] screen to help you a photo from one of
[1:15:22] my
[1:15:23] Bibles there
[1:15:26] do you see it a very important part of
[1:15:29] our story of Joseph in
[1:15:33] prison no let me draw a box around it
[1:15:37] for
[1:15:38] you
[1:15:41] there what is it brother
[1:15:44] ly it's the white space much like the
[1:15:48] meanwhile that we discussed last
[1:15:51] time two full years
[1:15:55] between the end of chapter 40 and the
[1:15:57] beginning of chapter
[1:15:59] 41 have you ever considered what was
[1:16:02] happening during those two long years
[1:16:06] while Joseph was in the
[1:16:08] dungeon apart from his despair his
[1:16:11] occasional pity party while he toiled
[1:16:13] away at his new set of responsibilities
[1:16:15] and no doubt wondering why me Lord what
[1:16:20] did I do to deserve this this is just so
[1:16:24] unfair
[1:16:30] we need to remember the nature of the
[1:16:34] prison
[1:16:35] facility and learn a bit about Egypt at
[1:16:38] the time of the 12th Dynasty and the
[1:16:40] reign of this Pharaoh Senor shet to the
[1:16:43] Pharaoh currently on the throne without
[1:16:46] it the two years may seem
[1:16:49] wasted they weren't and some of the
[1:16:52] subsequent chapters of the story of
[1:16:54] Joseph espec especially in the latter
[1:16:55] part of chapter 47 just make little or
[1:16:58] no sense without a little bit of
[1:17:00] historical context Egyptian history's
[1:17:02] complex I want to give you a very simple
[1:17:05] timeline get you to Joseph's era again
[1:17:09] to help provide
[1:17:12] context the first time Egypt was United
[1:17:15] as a nation rather than as a series of
[1:17:18] towns or Villages along the
[1:17:20] Nile began the period known as the Old
[1:17:23] Kingdom the Old King kingom is generally
[1:17:25] regarded as beginning about 2700 BC and
[1:17:29] ending about 2200 BC during this time
[1:17:32] the king the pharaoh ruled as an
[1:17:34] absolute monarch prior to this there was
[1:17:37] no Pharaoh there was no United Egypt and
[1:17:41] we're all familiar with the term Pharaoh
[1:17:43] it's not a name it's not even a title it
[1:17:45] literally means great house but it's a
[1:17:48] word often used to refer to king of
[1:17:51] Egypt I mentioned the pyramids there it
[1:17:54] was during this time that the fourth
[1:17:56] Dynasty ruler Pharaoh SFU built the
[1:17:59] first true pyramid called The Red
[1:18:02] Pyramid on his third known attempt this
[1:18:05] is a photo of that
[1:18:07] pyramid and a nearly 5,000 year old
[1:18:11] statue of sneferu 4700 years and another
[1:18:15] one with me inside pointing out some of
[1:18:17] the pyramid's internal construction
[1:18:19] features The Red Pyramid was completed
[1:18:21] about 2600 BC the subsequent pyramids of
[1:18:24] Giza were built during the period of the
[1:18:26] Old Kingdom mostly in the 2500s BC I
[1:18:30] mentioned the fourth Dynasty a dynasty
[1:18:33] simply means that the pharaohs were in
[1:18:34] direct line of descent father to son
[1:18:36] father to son father to son until there
[1:18:38] were no more male heirs in that line or
[1:18:40] until a coup or a war or some other
[1:18:43] event replace that family line with
[1:18:45] another and thus a new
[1:18:48] Dynasty so pyramids were were built
[1:18:50] during during the Old
[1:18:52] Kingdom that's followed
[1:18:55] by a disintegration of the central
[1:18:58] government the Old Kingdom collapsed
[1:19:01] Egypt entered What's called the first
[1:19:03] intermediate period that lasted from
[1:19:06] about 2200 to about 2050 BC for 150
[1:19:09] years they were just no central
[1:19:12] government this is when Abram and Sarai
[1:19:15] were in Egypt to flee from a famine in
[1:19:18] Canaan during this time the country was
[1:19:20] split into many smaller divisions called
[1:19:23] gnomes and in the end there were 42 such
[1:19:26] districts we might think of them as
[1:19:28] States or counties largely
[1:19:32] independent I've shown these 42 gnomes
[1:19:34] on the maps of the slide and I know it's
[1:19:36] too small to see the idea is that
[1:19:38] they're small there's lots of them and
[1:19:39] they're small got an arrow linking the
[1:19:42] two places because because our screen
[1:19:44] isn't portrait mode it's landscape mode
[1:19:48] and Egypt is a country that was made in
[1:19:51] portrait
[1:19:53] mode so so it's not important to know
[1:19:55] the number of these gnomes but it's
[1:19:57] important to understand that this is how
[1:20:00] Egypt was governed after the Old Kingdom
[1:20:02] Period gnomes were run by rulers known
[1:20:05] as
[1:20:07] nomarchs the Middle Kingdom it Rose from
[1:20:11] the chaos of the intermediate period
[1:20:13] starting about 2050 BC you don't have to
[1:20:15] remember the years it's just you know
[1:20:17] it's 4,000 years ago right lasted until
[1:20:20] about 1650 BC in this period Egypt was
[1:20:24] again United became very powerful
[1:20:27] military and economic power the 12th
[1:20:31] Dynasty during which Joseph lived is
[1:20:34] often considered the greatest of the
[1:20:37] Middle Kingdom Period and that dynasty
[1:20:39] ruled from about 1991 to about 1802 BC
[1:20:44] almost 200
[1:20:46] years Senor threet 2 the pharaoh who had
[1:20:50] issues with his Butler and Baker ruled
[1:20:53] from 189 7 to 1878
[1:20:58] BC not tonight but at some point you'll
[1:21:00] see the importance of
[1:21:02] that Joseph's white space began at age
[1:21:05] 28 about 1887 BC in the prison in
[1:21:08] Piper's
[1:21:10] Palace now S 2 was a powerful King and
[1:21:14] you can wake up now soret 2 was a
[1:21:17] powerful King but many of the nomars in
[1:21:20] his time were nearly as powerful as him
[1:21:22] remember this is just at the end of a
[1:21:24] period when the no marks ran everything
[1:21:27] politics in Egypt was a careful and
[1:21:29] dangerous
[1:21:30] business history tells us soru had good
[1:21:34] relationships with the nomarchs during
[1:21:37] his Reign this again will prove very
[1:21:40] important to our story well back to the
[1:21:43] white
[1:21:44] space who were the VIP prisoners that
[1:21:47] passed to the king's prison during those
[1:21:50] two
[1:21:51] years because essentially if you
[1:21:53] offended the king were either executed
[1:21:55] or given a royal timeout a timeout in
[1:21:59] The
[1:22:00] Roundhouse these would have been men of
[1:22:02] influence officials even narks
[1:22:07] VIPs Farm Workers weren't likely to
[1:22:09] offend the pharaoh who was Joseph put in
[1:22:12] charge of to look after to take care
[1:22:18] of these very and very powerful people
[1:22:23] during their time
[1:22:26] out the prison was not a destination it
[1:22:29] was a waypoint no VIP served a long
[1:22:32] sentence that sort of thing just didn't
[1:22:34] exist 4,000 years ago in
[1:22:36] Egypt so Joseph despite being a despised
[1:22:39] Hebrew and in a slave would nonetheless
[1:22:41] be compassionate sympathetic listening
[1:22:44] ear to anyone who wanted to complain or
[1:22:46] vent as as we just read with the those
[1:22:49] two guys in their dreams during this
[1:22:53] time Joseph wasn't asleep he would have
[1:22:56] learned a lot about Palace politics how
[1:22:59] do things work here adding to what he'd
[1:23:02] learned at Piper's House Parties when he
[1:23:04] was a COO who's in who's out why who was
[1:23:11] sympathetic who was not which no marks
[1:23:14] were aligned with Senor threat and which
[1:23:17] were less aligned where the loyalties
[1:23:21] were where the money and influence
[1:23:23] flowed
[1:23:25] what sort of person each VIP was
[1:23:28] nowadays we talk it about networking
[1:23:30] right by spending time serving the VIPs
[1:23:34] during their detention he got to know
[1:23:37] and know about many of the narks and
[1:23:40] their lieutenants and other senior
[1:23:45] officials this is going to prove to be
[1:23:47] very important for him soon all the
[1:23:50] while serving to the best of his ability
[1:23:53] learning keeping the place running
[1:23:56] smoothly and efficiently maintaining his
[1:23:59] Integrity in the face of his ongoing
[1:24:01] crushing seemingly NeverEnding
[1:24:06] adversity another lesson from
[1:24:09] Joseph not giving into the why
[1:24:12] me because it's not about me it's about
[1:24:16] him I'm reminded of an acquaintance who
[1:24:19] walked away from following the Lord
[1:24:24] Christian person I dearly loved was sick
[1:24:27] I prayed and prayed for them to be
[1:24:29] healed but the person died if God is the
[1:24:33] Healer if the prayer of faith will save
[1:24:35] the sick and I know my faith was strong
[1:24:38] and my prayers heartfelt in Earnest then
[1:24:41] why did this person die I can't believe
[1:24:44] and serve a God Who
[1:24:46] Lies an atheist classmate of mine in
[1:24:49] high school often said Man created God
[1:24:51] in his own image sadly he had plenty of
[1:24:56] evidence the problem is that we tend to
[1:24:59] create a caricature an image of God in
[1:25:01] our minds brother Daniel preached about
[1:25:03] this a while back based on a very
[1:25:07] imperfect understanding of him and his
[1:25:09] word we serve God but we we're often
[1:25:12] serving the god that we believe him to
[1:25:15] be when things don't go as we want or
[1:25:19] expect we blame God how could God let
[1:25:22] this happen to me or to them them God's
[1:25:25] not at fault it's the incorrect or
[1:25:28] incomplete image of God we've created in
[1:25:32] our minds the
[1:25:34] Battleground what we need to do is know
[1:25:37] God better not blame him for not
[1:25:39] matching the image we've created of
[1:25:43] him understand and accept his
[1:25:48] sovereignty he's not a tool in our tool
[1:25:50] box where we say in the name of Jesus
[1:25:53] and therefore he's got to do it the
[1:25:54] genie in the bottle that's not who he is
[1:25:58] we need to align our values with his not
[1:26:03] his with ours Psalm 37 I I Delight
[1:26:07] thyself also in the Lord and He Shall
[1:26:09] give Thee the desires of thine heart and
[1:26:11] I I remember for years thinking this
[1:26:13] means well if I if I Delight myself in
[1:26:16] the Lord then then but I really desire
[1:26:19] to have a wonderful wife and and great
[1:26:21] kids and a good job I'll get a wonderful
[1:26:24] wife wife and I did and great kids and a
[1:26:27] and a good job but that's not what it
[1:26:30] says Delight thyself in the
[1:26:33] lord well if you're doing that what is
[1:26:36] the desire of your heart the desire of
[1:26:39] your heart is to delight yourself in the
[1:26:42] Lord and therefore he has given you that
[1:26:45] desire of your heart because that's what
[1:26:48] you're doing is delighting yourself in
[1:26:50] the Lord align your values wildes values
[1:26:55] with his
[1:26:56] values we often want relief from our
[1:27:00] troubles when the Lord's promise is to
[1:27:03] comfort us to be with us through the
[1:27:08] tough times we kept reading in prison in
[1:27:10] slavery and the Lord was with Joseph we
[1:27:15] need to learn from our troubles as he
[1:27:17] Comforts us just as Joseph will
[1:27:19] eventually realize that it really was
[1:27:21] the Lord sending him to Egypt that he
[1:27:24] had to be sent in exactly the way he was
[1:27:27] sent work on Piper's estate as a slave
[1:27:32] become coo and then back into the pit
[1:27:35] for those long years it was the best way
[1:27:41] possible for him to be able to fulfill
[1:27:45] his role in God's plan we'll see this as
[1:27:49] we get further in this
[1:27:51] series Joseph's compassionate ear for
[1:27:53] those who cared to share would provide
[1:27:56] Comfort soulless but not relief not
[1:28:00] release from prison again modeling Jesus
[1:28:03] who promised to be our
[1:28:07] comforter back to our
[1:28:10] story Genesis 41 it came to pass at the
[1:28:15] end of two full years about 1886 BC that
[1:28:19] pharaoh senusret to dreamed and behold
[1:28:24] he stood by the river and behold there
[1:28:27] came up out of the river seven
[1:28:29] well-favored cattle fat
[1:28:32] fleshed they fed in a
[1:28:35] meadow and behold seven other cattle
[1:28:38] came up after them out of the river
[1:28:40] ill-favored lean fleshed and stood by
[1:28:44] the other cattle upon the brink of the
[1:28:46] river and the ill flavored and lean
[1:28:49] fleshed cattle did eat up the seven well
[1:28:51] favored and fat cattle
[1:28:54] so Pharaoh
[1:28:56] awoke he slept and dreamed a second time
[1:28:59] and behold seven ears of grain came up
[1:29:02] on one stock Rank and that doesn't mean
[1:29:06] modern rank it means they were fat plump
[1:29:08] healthy and
[1:29:09] good and behold seven thin ears blasted
[1:29:14] with the East Wind sprung up after
[1:29:17] them and the Seven thin ears devoured
[1:29:20] the seven Rank and full ears and Pharaoh
[1:29:23] awoke and behold it was a
[1:29:25] dream a
[1:29:27] nightmare nightmare on the Nile it came
[1:29:30] to pass in the morning his Spirit was
[1:29:35] troubled and he sent and called for All
[1:29:37] The Magicians of Egypt and all the wise
[1:29:39] men thereof and Pharaoh told them his
[1:29:42] dream but there was none that could
[1:29:45] interpret them to
[1:29:46] Pharaoh probably not the first time s
[1:29:49] thre you had nightmares but these dreams
[1:29:52] and especially the first Dre one would
[1:29:55] have troubled him
[1:29:58] greatly
[1:30:00] why yeah time for a little more
[1:30:03] background and context about Egypt
[1:30:06] specifically about Senor threat II but
[1:30:09] excuse me first a little about a primary
[1:30:12] goddess of their
[1:30:13] religion hator one of the chief
[1:30:16] goddesses in Egyptian mythology was
[1:30:19] hatur among other things she was
[1:30:21] considered the Divine mother of the
[1:30:23] Pharaoh
[1:30:27] excuse
[1:30:29] me when you get
[1:30:31] old she was often represented as a cow
[1:30:34] or as a woman having cow's
[1:30:37] ears or as a woman wearing a headdress
[1:30:39] with cows horn surrounding a
[1:30:42] sundisk hator had more temples dedicated
[1:30:45] to her than any other deity in Egypt
[1:30:49] perhaps the most prominent being located
[1:30:52] at a temple at dendera
[1:30:55] like most temples it was on the East
[1:30:57] Bank of the
[1:31:00] Nile this image of a of a pectral a kind
[1:31:03] of a of a pendant on a necklace and of a
[1:31:06] crown it was found in the Tomb of a
[1:31:08] believed to be daughter of SRU the
[1:31:12] pectral even has the name of SRU
[1:31:14] inscribed on it she would have worn
[1:31:16] these in the
[1:31:18] palace Joseph would have seen her
[1:31:21] wearing these very
[1:31:25] items not replicas these these 4,000
[1:31:30] year old items and here's an amazing
[1:31:33] coincidence the woman the princess who
[1:31:37] merited her own special tomb in SAS ru's
[1:31:41] funerary complex this princess believed
[1:31:44] to be SAS ru's daughter just happened to
[1:31:46] be named sit hatur
[1:31:50] unet daughter of hatur of dend
[1:31:56] he's named his
[1:31:58] daughter after this goddess represented
[1:32:01] by a cow dendera sits on the bank of the
[1:32:04] Nile so the name is in effect a symbolic
[1:32:07] cow from the bank of the Nile
[1:32:10] River wow okay but didn't have Seven
[1:32:14] Daughters named after hator right
[1:32:17] correct however in the Book of the Dead
[1:32:20] the the manual on how to survive in the
[1:32:22] afterlife are very ious magic spells
[1:32:25] incantations well spell number 148 is
[1:32:28] directed to Raw the Sun God and his
[1:32:30] attendance hatur was a consort of raw in
[1:32:34] Egyptian
[1:32:35] mythology and when you bump into raw in
[1:32:38] the afterlife you're supposed to say I
[1:32:40] have come before thee oh my Lord raw I
[1:32:42] would make to flourish the seven cows
[1:32:46] and their
[1:32:48] bull Senor shred is in a panic there's
[1:32:52] too much in this dream that hits close
[1:32:53] close to home his daughter the one who
[1:32:55] will get a special tomb in his funeral
[1:32:57] complex is named after the goddess
[1:32:58] represented by a cow and there are seven
[1:33:01] cows involved straight from The Book of
[1:33:02] the Dead he wants answers he wants them
[1:33:06] now this is personal tells his
[1:33:09] appointment secretary cancel the
[1:33:10] meetings for the day tells his chief of
[1:33:12] staff get The Magicians and wise men and
[1:33:15] dream interpreters together get them in
[1:33:16] the palace and do it
[1:33:20] now how do the wise men and magicians
[1:33:23] interpret
[1:33:27] dreams they have a dream
[1:33:29] manual this fragment is located in the
[1:33:32] British
[1:33:34] museum the Papyrus is from about 1200 BC
[1:33:38] but the language that used the way the
[1:33:40] sentences are constructed and so forth
[1:33:42] is from about 1800 or 2,000 BC the very
[1:33:44] time of Joseph so this fragment is
[1:33:48] likely to be consistent with the dream
[1:33:50] scroll used in soret 2's course
[1:33:55] it was translated into English in 1935
[1:33:58] you can download the English translation
[1:34:00] of it from the British Museum website
[1:34:03] the manual fragment in the museum lists
[1:34:04] about a 100 dreams and their meanings
[1:34:07] both ends of the scroll are missing so
[1:34:09] we aren't just how many more dream
[1:34:10] scenes it claims to
[1:34:12] interpret it's a bit hard to see in the
[1:34:15] photo I keep asking you to sit closer
[1:34:18] but some of the text is in red the
[1:34:21] remainder is in Black the stuff that's
[1:34:23] in red
[1:34:25] bad well back to Pharaoh in the palace
[1:34:28] after fitful night trying to sleep after
[1:34:30] having had a pair of back-to-back
[1:34:32] nightmares The Magicians and wise men
[1:34:35] consult the manual they're becoming
[1:34:39] frantic no there there's just nothing in
[1:34:42] here that matches your dreams Pharaoh
[1:34:47] wish we could help we'll keep looking
[1:34:50] sorry meanwhile the dream guys are
[1:34:53] scratching their heads after desperately
[1:34:55] searching to their scroll the Bible
[1:34:58] tells us they couldn't interpret the
[1:34:59] dream hoping not to incur a very upset
[1:35:02] Pharaoh's wrath and the cup Bearer we
[1:35:05] know he's nearby he may may have
[1:35:08] approached them and asked excuse me if
[1:35:11] you got a moment I I once had a a dream
[1:35:14] about squeezing wine into a
[1:35:17] cup does it say something about
[1:35:20] that let me see squeeze grapes
[1:35:24] oh oh oh yeah here it
[1:35:26] is
[1:35:27] wait brother ly are you telling us that
[1:35:32] the butler's dream was in the fragment
[1:35:36] of the dream scroll that has been
[1:35:39] preserved for thousands of
[1:35:42] years
[1:35:43] yeah the Lord not only watches over his
[1:35:46] word he watches other word too including
[1:35:50] yours including
[1:35:52] mine oh where were we let me see squeeze
[1:35:56] grapes oh yeah here it
[1:35:58] is if a man sees himself squeezing wine
[1:36:03] into a cup bad see it's in red ink right
[1:36:07] here it means his possessions will be
[1:36:10] taken from him going to lose everything
[1:36:14] sorry about
[1:36:15] that are you sure it doesn't say they'll
[1:36:19] be restored or that he'll be restored no
[1:36:23] no I'm really sorry for you but it's
[1:36:25] right here this one is very clear
[1:36:28] they'll be taken no mistake you can Bank
[1:36:30] on
[1:36:31] it oh well thank you uh sir excuse me uh
[1:36:39] Pharaoh sen uh I may know someone who
[1:36:43] can
[1:36:44] help what what what's that oh bring me
[1:36:47] another
[1:36:49] drink then spake the chief Butler un
[1:36:51] Pharaoh saying I do remember my faults
[1:36:54] this day and he speaks to Pharaoh in the
[1:36:56] third person indication of respect or
[1:36:59] Royal Court protocol Pharaoh was wroth
[1:37:02] with his servants and and put me in
[1:37:04] detention and potier the captain of the
[1:37:07] guard's house both me and the chief
[1:37:09] Baker and and we each Dreamed a Dream
[1:37:12] the same night I and he we dreamed each
[1:37:16] man according to the interpretation of
[1:37:18] his
[1:37:19] dream there was with us a a young man I
[1:37:22] I don't recall it his name but but but
[1:37:24] he was a Hebrew a a servant a slave he
[1:37:29] doesn't indicate Joseph as a prisoner
[1:37:31] but is a
[1:37:32] slave a slave to potier the the captain
[1:37:35] of the guard and we told him what we had
[1:37:38] each dreamed and and he interpreted to
[1:37:40] us our
[1:37:42] dreams to each of us according to his
[1:37:45] dream he did interpret he didn't have a
[1:37:49] manual and it came to pass as he
[1:37:52] interpreted to us
[1:37:54] so it was me He restored unto mine
[1:37:57] office and and him he
[1:38:01] impaled well then Pharaoh sent and
[1:38:04] called Joseph and that's for next
[1:38:10] time what lessons can we take home from
[1:38:13] this oh we've talked about a few
[1:38:15] already but there are several I've
[1:38:18] related some of them as we've studied
[1:38:20] this evening I think one of the most
[1:38:22] important
[1:38:24] is that we learn from our
[1:38:25] troubles as the Lord Comforts us Comfort
[1:38:29] is a
[1:38:30] promise rescue is a
[1:38:33] Hope just as Joseph will eventually
[1:38:36] realize it really was the Lord sending
[1:38:38] him to Egypt and that he had to be sent
[1:38:41] in exactly the way he was sent and work
[1:38:43] as a slave and be confined in prison
[1:38:47] because it was the best way possible for
[1:38:49] him to be able to fulfill his role in
[1:38:51] God's great plan and we'll see this as
[1:38:54] we continue our study of Joseph's
[1:38:57] life two short selections from the
[1:38:59] gospels come to mind about what has
[1:39:02] happened so far in our
[1:39:04] story what we're in the midst of with
[1:39:07] Pharaoh's
[1:39:09] dreams on the day of his resurrection we
[1:39:11] we read in John chapter 20 then the same
[1:39:14] day at evening being the first day of
[1:39:16] the week when the doors were shut where
[1:39:18] the disciples were assembled for fear of
[1:39:20] the Jews came Jesus and stood in the
[1:39:22] midst and saith unto them peace be unto
[1:39:26] you
[1:39:29] Shalom and when he had so said he showed
[1:39:31] them his hands and his side then were
[1:39:34] the disciples glad when they saw the
[1:39:37] Lord then Jesus said to them again peace
[1:39:41] be unto you as my father has sent me
[1:39:45] even so send I you if the musicians
[1:39:49] could come at this
[1:39:51] time we're being sent
[1:39:54] just as Joseph was sent just as Jesus
[1:39:57] was sent neither had an easy Journey
[1:40:01] he's telling them this as he reminds
[1:40:03] them of his suffering his crucifixion
[1:40:07] you see these nail prints in my hands as
[1:40:10] the father has sent me I'm sending you
[1:40:13] you see these nail prints in my
[1:40:16] hands extending to them hope through the
[1:40:19] evidence of his resurrection that
[1:40:20] they're also witnessing we should not
[1:40:23] expect our journey to be easy either and
[1:40:27] from Luke chapter 12 Jesus telling his
[1:40:30] disciples about their life
[1:40:33] Journey seek not what you shall eat or
[1:40:36] what you shall drink that's the part we
[1:40:39] always remember neither be ye of
[1:40:41] doubtful mind be people of
[1:40:45] faith for all these things to the
[1:40:48] nations of the world he's not talking
[1:40:50] about Germany and America and Mexico
[1:40:52] he's talking got people of all
[1:40:55] ethnicities everybody seeks after this
[1:40:58] your father knows you have need of these
[1:41:00] things but rather Focus your efforts to
[1:41:03] seek ye the kingdom of God all these
[1:41:07] things shall be added unto you fear not
[1:41:10] little
[1:41:12] flock fear not Joseph it's your father's
[1:41:16] good pleasure to give you the
[1:41:21] kingdom well as we close and pass the
[1:41:25] service back to brother Daniel I'd like
[1:41:27] us to sing about that Journey you may
[1:41:29] not know the song and that's okay but
[1:41:31] the chorus is simple and please join me
[1:41:33] in the
[1:41:34] chorus it's called keep
[1:41:41] walking I searched and I search for the
[1:41:46] road that leads to Glory I wondered if
[1:41:50] I'd ever find the way
[1:41:54] I sat down to rest for my feet had grown
[1:41:59] so weary but then I Heard a Voice Within
[1:42:03] Me
[1:42:04] say you've got to keep on walking just
[1:42:10] keep right on
[1:42:12] walking walking in the light of the
[1:42:16] Lord you'll get to Heaven someday if you
[1:42:22] walk the right way walking in the light
[1:42:27] of the
[1:42:29] Lord I pray and I prayed for the Lord to
[1:42:34] give me mercy I prayed for him to
[1:42:38] brighten up my
[1:42:41] way I was so afraid for the road became
[1:42:46] so lonely and then I Heard a Voice
[1:42:51] Within Me say
[1:42:53] you've got to keep on walking just keep
[1:42:58] right on walking walking in the light of
[1:43:03] the
[1:43:04] Lord you'll get to Heaven someday if you
[1:43:10] walk the right way walking in the light
[1:43:15] of the
[1:43:18] Lord after a while brother random
[1:43:21] describing an event of the 19
[1:43:23] 1940s I felt something
[1:43:27] going got
[1:43:29] close I stepped back up behind a great
[1:43:32] big column there I said Heavenly Father
[1:43:36] what would you have your servant do it
[1:43:39] kept
[1:43:39] [Music]
[1:43:44] going I was real still a minute I heard
[1:43:47] a deep voice say
[1:43:49] turn go back
[1:43:53] well I turned and went walking back down
[1:43:56] the street I walked I walked on past the
[1:44:01] hotel on down through South Memphis just
[1:44:05] walking on and
[1:44:07] on was going walking along there I
[1:44:10] thought
[1:44:11] Lord I don't know you said walk here I
[1:44:16] am I'm
[1:44:18] walking I just kept on walking walking
[1:44:23] walking walked out pretty near the other
[1:44:26] side of
[1:44:30] Memphis you've got to keep on walking
[1:44:35] just keep right on walking walking in
[1:44:40] the light of the
[1:44:42] Lord you'll get to Heaven someday if you
[1:44:48] walk the right way walking in the light
[1:44:52] of of the
[1:45:00] Lord amen do you appreciate
[1:45:04] [Applause]
[1:45:08] that
[1:45:09] was he talking about all these troubles
[1:45:13] trials Joseph went
[1:45:15] through and and then he put that
[1:45:18] scripture up there from Isaiah and God
[1:45:21] says you know
[1:45:23] my ways are different than your ways my
[1:45:27] ways are higher my thoughts and my ways
[1:45:29] are higher than your ways and God has a
[1:45:32] way of doing things and those ways don't
[1:45:35] change you would think Lord why don't
[1:45:38] you just make it to where I don't have
[1:45:40] to suffer why don't you just put that
[1:45:43] character right in me but he has a way
[1:45:46] that has been from the beginning to
[1:45:49] build character in a man or a woman and
[1:45:52] we see that with Joseph constantly
[1:45:54] suffering constantly in prison and we
[1:45:57] even God did not even spare his own son
[1:46:01] right from going through those things
[1:46:04] even his own son lived a hard
[1:46:07] life and finally at the end suffered as
[1:46:11] bad as anyone has ever suffered
[1:46:13] before appreciate that and I think that
[1:46:18] now we're Beyond moving beyond Joseph's
[1:46:22] suffering I think
[1:46:23] and now we're going to see what all of
[1:46:26] this that experience and and learning
[1:46:30] and everything I love the way brother
[1:46:31] Lyall said that he was when he was in
[1:46:33] prison he was
[1:46:36] learning he was learning from these
[1:46:38] political prisoners he was learning from
[1:46:41] these these people that were in there
[1:46:43] they were the they were important people
[1:46:46] and Joseph learned and now in the next
[1:46:50] part we're going to see how all that
[1:46:53] Joseph Learned was applied and it ended
[1:46:56] up saving an entire nation let's all
[1:46:59] stand for
[1:47:02] there I sought the
[1:47:07] Lord and he answered
[1:47:12] me he delivered
[1:47:17] me from everything
[1:47:23] those who look on
[1:47:26] him are
[1:47:31] R they'll never be
[1:47:35] asham they'll never be
[1:47:45] ashame this poor man

[1:48:04] enemy the Son of
