willing I'll be preaching the funeral and then after the funeral we'll have fellowship and food here at here in the fellowship hall keep that family in prayer names her name's Rosalinda and um it's her it's her side of the family you know friends I preaching on Sunday and how important it is for us to reach out a hand for us to be there when they don't have anyone I was talking with the sister today I was asking about churches and and I got the feeling that this is this is the only thing that they have thought Lord thank you and and I can't think of a better group of people to welcome them in and and to bless them I've asked sister Rachel to prepare and get everything ready it's just a Rachel you don't know what you mean so many people [Applause] your labor of love about as I said on Sunday love it requires labor and and we we don't this is an unmerited gift that we have from Christ but but we labor for each other and and we love each other and and it means so much in talking with this sister I can just feel how much it means she didn't know what to do she was she was asking she said she said how much do you charge and what would be the charge for the church and it's like sister you're the one suffering don't worry about that and you may only come here a couple times a year or whatever it is but you're part of us you're one with us and we love you and and we want you here and there are some of the finest people that's what I told her I said you come to this Tucson Tabernacle there's some of the finest people that you've ever met just full of love and and they'll welcome you and she was just I know it's hard on her but it feels good to have somebody there when you might not have anybody so remember that family in prayer as as we bow our heads friends if you have a request upon your heart and make it known before our Lord and savior with an uplifted hand [Music] Lord God Almighty Lord Lord these dear friends of ours and family that that are traveling

the nature of people just come out and and backbiting and coming against each other but as always we're going to see the nature of Jesus Christ also come out in her his servants of the Lord these Great Men We call apostles the Apostle Paul and those that were with him for the wild God bless you my friend [Music] surely [Music] and one is [Music] amen that's so true thank you so much good evening go ahead and be seated for a couple of minutes because I I I'm gonna go off my notes which is not something that I do easily but that's what I'm doing this evening at sunset do you know what day it is Wednesday Wednesday that's good I I was expecting a comment something like that on the Jewish calendar it's the ninth day of the month of of a a day they call Tasha which is Hebrew for nine takes about off ninth of of it's probably the saddest day on the entire Jewish calendar off it's a day of mourning a day of great morning it's not a Biblical holiday but according to a Jewish tradition according to Jewish calendar according to history on this date or very near this date and 1445 BC the spies came back with their report Joshua and Caleb said we can take it the other 10 said they can't and Israel rejected going into the land and they spent 40 years wandering in the wilderness till that generation passed away off 586 BC the forces of Nebuchadnezzar destroyed Solomon's Temple on the ninth day of off tasiah the destruction of the Temple in 70 A.D Titus destroyed the second temple off 70 A.D and 135 A.D the second Jewish Revolt the markokpa Revolt was suppressed they say four hundred thousand Jews were butchered at the Battle of Batar that ended that and the Jews were sent forcibly out of their land in 1290 A.D Jews were expelled from England in 1306 on this day the Jews were expelled from France in 1492 on this day the Jews were expelled from Spain in 1914 Germany and World War One in 1941 Heinrich Himmler received the formal approval from the Nazi party for the final solution the extermination of the Jewish people in 1942 began the mass deportation of the Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto to the death camp at Treblinka brother Jeremy if you could put up those two verses from Ecclesiastes that that come to mind Ecclesiastes 3 1. to everything there's a season there's a time to every purpose under Heaven verse 4 a time to weep A Time To Laugh A Time a Time mourn a time to dance this is a very sad day a very heavy day for the Jewish people I just thought I'd share that with you since I'm not sure how many of you knew that today tonight is that anniversary the destruction of the temples the the rejection of the promise to enter the land so many things happened on that day tonight we'll be continuing our study in the book of Acts we started four months ago on March 22nd with brother Daniel teaching Acts 1. I'd plan to finish chapter 19 last Wednesday on the 19th but that didn't work out so we'll conclude it tonight uh there's much more here than you might suspect from a from a book burning and some disgruntled silversmiths I always wonder about that word disgruntled if you're not disgruntled does that mean you're gruntled I I don't know it's never made a lot of sense to me but anyway let's get started I'll have you here all night but before we open the Bible if we could stand please and approach the author Lord Jesus we have friends that are very sad tonight some of those friends are your children some of those friends have been called by your name some of those friends have embraced the gospel Lord Jesus we pray that you'd be with them and comfort them at this time as they reflect and Lord I pray that you be with us tonight help me Lord Jesus that they're not be loyal thoughts that there not be anything coming from any direction but from you Lord guard my lips Lord that I might not speak anything that would cause anyone difficulty or stumbling or hurt or harm but Lord that the words of life might flow forth and that we might all draw closer to you as we study your word and we thank you we thank you for this record that Luke provided for us that you inspired him to do so many years ago that we can draw blessings from it even today in Jesus name we pray amen Acts 19 relates the first portion of what we call Paul's third missionary journey this part of the Evangelistic effort takes place entirely within the city of Ephesus chapter 19 is only in the city of Ephesus and it covers a span of about three years the overall theme of this chapter is there's no substitute for the Holy Spirit I've subtitled this latter portion of it consider the context the context of this account was understood by first century believers but it's much less apparent to us after 20 centuries just as teshav is not something that we think about but it's the context that shows us how powerful and how different if Paul's Ministry was an Ephesus to help set the stage of tonight's section of Acts 19 let's turn in our Bibles first through the book of Exodus the 20th chapter and then we'll read a short segment from Acts 19. The Exodus setting is Mount Sinai during the third calendar month after Moses led the enslaved Israelite Nation out of bondage in Egypt recall Passover began in the middle of the first month Jewish tradition says that it was 50 days after Passover on the day otherwise celebrated as a Feast of Weeks the day we call Pentecost that God gave the law to Moses now when you found Exodus 20 raise your hand say Amen let me know we're there some of you were there okay enough of you were there I'll put some more of it up here for you okay and God spake all these words this wasn't some guy this was God God spake these words saying I am the Lord thy God which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondage Moses didn't bring you out I brought you out Thou shalt have no other gods before me no other gods none Thou shalt not make unto thee any Graven image or any likeness of anything that's in Heaven above or the Earth beneath or that's in the water under the Earth Thou shalt not bow down themselves to them nor serve them for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children under the third and fourth generation of them that hate me and showing Mercy unto thousands of them that love me and that's just not everybody loves me I'm picking thousands no there are thousands that love him and he's showing Mercy to every one of them that love me and keep my Commandments and now if you'll turn to acts 18 just 3 verses 19 to 21 that's a flashback to the end of Paul's second Journey he had just left Corinth after 18 months sailing for Ephesus accompanied by his friends Aquila and Priscilla and he that's Paul came to Ephesus and left them that's Akila and Priscilla there but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned his method of teaching which we described last time he reasoned with the Jews I picked up on that word reason it's such harmony with Isaiah 1 18 come now and let us reason together saith the Lord why why a purpose to what end though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be white as snow though they'd be red like crimson they shall be his wool as precisely the message that Paul's bringing the good news of the Gospel forgiveness for those sins purification and when they the Jewish people of the sunniac desired him to Cherry longer with them he said nope and send it not when he paid them for a will he said I must by all means keep this Feast that's coming in Jerusalem but I will return again unto you God willing and you sailed from Ephesus please be seated by way of quick review Paul's first journey with Barnabas was in Cyprus phrygia and galatia the second Journey with Silas started in galatia and frigia then went on to Europe through Philippi thessalonica and Berea three cities of Macedonia they continued to Ikea that's Greece including Athens and especially Corinth Paul stayed for more than a year and a half in Corinth Sin City is brother Daniel pointed out to us before returning home to Antioch of Syria by way of Ephesus and Jerusalem the third Journey that we're now following started yet again in galatia and forget but Luke simply mentions these districts with no details that ball went through there Acts 19 begins with Paul's arrival in Ephesus now in the first portion of Acts 19 which we studied a fortnight ago that's an English word it means two weeks Paul began his ministry in Ephesus with baptism and the necessity of receiving the Holy Spirit we saw how Paul gently respectfully led a group of 12 disciples of Apollos who had since traveled onto Corinth further into the truth until they received the gift of the indwelling Holy Spirit and their lives Paul then went to the synagogue and after three months of teaching and then being pretty well rejected he decided to continue his teaching and the school of a person named tyrannus he taught there for at least two more years during this time we read that Miracles occurred in the form of healings and exorcisms to the mechanism of towels and aprons which Paul had touched we ended part one of chapter 19. with an incident or seven men sons of a Jewish priest attempted exorcism to cast out demons using the name of Jesus whom Paul preaches but they lacked the life behind the name the possessed man Paul I know Jesus I know who are you he attacked these seven guys overpowered them they fled from that building injured and naked word of all this spread new Believers had real fear of God came confessing their past sins I thought I'd bring up this map where I've circled in in yellow where Ephesus is located in and what they called Asia we think of it as a western part of turkey the the red circles are around Antioch of facidia troas Philippi thessalonica Berea Athens Corinth these are cities where Paul's ministered as we've previously read in Acts you can see they're almost all cities around the Aegean Sea note many islands in the Aegean especially you can see there in the southern part between Ephesus and going across to to Athens hazards to navigation in a world with no GPS they didn't even have compasses that didn't come until about 1270 A.D they had no accurate Maps just fragile wooden boots Paul's Ministry in Asia Minor part of what we call turkey in Europe largely took place in the coastal cities around the Aegean well I'm sure you're asking yourself so what's all this was cities why did Paul go to cities and not rural areas you know where the salt of the earth are not cities right Paul generally started his evangelism and Jewish synagogues such synagogues only existed in cities that have been in existence for a few centuries as we discovered in Philippi that was a new city only some 80 years old and had no history of settlement before that as a result when the Jewish people were scattered over the previous 500 years tejab 586 BC they had no reason to settle in the area that became Philippi but they could settle and make a living and establish themselves in the then existing cities Jeremiah for example wrote and told those carried to Babylon to settle and to prosper there Jeremiah 29 verses 4-7 and can't you just see the hand of the Lord in all of this consider the Lord knew exactly when he would come in the flesh of Jesus Christ he knew the minimum state of required civilization before his coming would be able to accomplish its goal he knew the Kingdom of Israel would fail and fall so the scattering of the Jewish people took place at just the right time in history so there would be settlements scattered throughout the Mediterranean world with the Jewish presence why well this was in part so an evangelist known as Paul of Tarsus could spread the good news and that the newly minted Christians would have a place to go where the word of God could be heard on a regular basis through the preaching and reading and the synagogues synagogues only came into being after the Babylonian captivity the destruction of Jerusalem when there was neither Tabernacle nor Temple the entire infrastructure needed for Effective early evangelism was thus brought about patiently over a period of some 500 or 600 years and just as soon as it was ready Jesus appeared Christians shared the same sacred texts as the Jewish people there was no new testament Testament we're told that faith comes by hearing the word of God Galatians 3 Romans 10. synagogues were the places where that occurred in those days people were generally non-literate they couldn't read manuscripts Scrolls and the like were incredibly expensive far beyond the means that most people to acquire even if they did have the skill to read but in synagogues portions of scripture were read aloud every Sabbath as you study history even geography you can find God's fingerprints everywhere but you have to look just like police detectives applied powders to reveal potential fingerprints if they find any they lift or otherwise record them compare them to a vast database of fingerprints to find out whose they are this process is not instant can be quite time consuming it requires effort diligence dedication and care and that's how we need to approach the word this evening last time we ended with Acts 19 Verse 18 we'll pick up there and continue now with our study and many that believed came and confessed and showed their deeds the Amplified Bible puts it this way many also of those who were now Believers came making full confession as brother Aaron mentioned Isaiah 53 confess with your mouth full confession and thoroughly exposing their former deceptive and evil practices in other words the fear of God came on those professing Christ they saw there were consequences to pretending to lacking the life behind the name and not only that but verse 19 many of them also which used curious Arts practitioners of the occult sorcery Magic they brought their books it says books but we're talking about Scrolls perhaps including codices which is kind of the earliest form of a book there are books of spells and incantations and Magic they brought them together and burned them before all men this was done in public in full View of the entire city and they counted the price of them these books and they found it to be 50 000 pieces of silver what's 50 000 pieces of silver mean if you convert it to Modern monetary value it's it's difficult I'm sure you've all noticed grocery store prices this year a lot different than they were two years ago so we're told that that a a drachma is is kind of a unit of currency 50 000 of those as it was represented here but books and Scrolls were very very expensive they were all made by hand and these sorts of books would have been extremely rare rare protected by the practitioners of the incantation zone so oh the secret stuff we can't share that with you and through this verse 20 so mightily grew the word of God and prevailed continued in a powerful way it grew an influence now to prevail means there's resistance there's opposition there's a struggle something has to be overcome they don't Prevail if there's nothing that you're fighting against verse 19 here it's a little bit nuanced the ones who practice these arts and burned their books were like those of Verse 18 converts to Christ these are new Christians they didn't want to sell their books they easily could have they were worth a lot but they were denouncing the contents of the books they didn't want to spread those practices that were described in them any further I don't know if you realize it if you think about it these people were destroying their means of livelihood no turning back they'd made a full commitment and consider the impact this is a very large collection of these Scrolls books that that drachma the unit of coinage it's represented was a day's wage for one who worked for wages at six days a week that would work out to a little over 160 man years at an equivalent today of say fifty thousand dollars a year that's a bit over eight million dollars equivalent so we have to ask ourselves was it important that this public book burning took place in Ephesus if so in what way is that significant would it have had the same effect or be so important that Luke would record it and ask for us if if it were in a neighboring town or maybe even a different city say thyatira or Philadelphia or laodicea how does this event support the assertion of verse 20 so mightily grew the word of God and prevailed we've looked at maps to see the cities where the gospels spread the message of Grace and salvation to the Roman world we've talked a bit about cities Jerusalem the significance of the location where Peter preached on Pentecost caesarea its significance as Cornelius household came to know the Lord Philippi what it meant to be a Roman Colony Corinth the hedonistic debauchery of its lifestyle in fact even of its religious practice Athens its multitude of Idols it was said it's easier to find an idol in Athens than another human being by this time Paul has spent about three years in Ephesus so let's take a closer look at this city this time not from a perspective of geography but from a perspective of history and archeology rather than just being a port city on the Turkish Coast Ephesus well here's a drawing of what Ephesus might have looked like Ephesus was founded about the 10th or 11th century BC that's around the time that David ruled in Israel if we skip down to about a thousand years to the time of Caesar Augustus he made it the capital of the province of Asia this region of Western turkey it was an important cultural trade commercial and political Center it's also an important port it was a major city in Paul's day since its destruction and abandonment around 263 A.D the Lagoon Harbor is silted up the Mediterranean is now a couple of miles away from the ancient city location at its height its population had long been estimated to have been as many as a quarter million but estimates now based on archaeological findings suggests it was closer to about fifty thousand that's still a large city either way but it turns out that there were three key features of Ephesus that are related to Acts chapter 19. and why these things come together and make it important let's look at the first one now we've just read of a very public a huge book burning now they weren't e-books they didn't just delete files or apps from their eye stones nowaday we search for information on the world wide web via the Internet when I was in school we used encyclopedias for a quick look up and went to a library for further research and the world of the first century there was no internet there were no encyclopedias books were expensive most people couldn't read anyway but if you were literate libraries were rare the volumes they contained almost priceless but Ephesus contained a library unlike America today libraries were not common in the world of the first century in fact they were extremely rare Ephesus contained what some report is the third largest library in the ancient Mediterranean world after Alexandria and pergamum it much smaller than those two but it nevertheless housed more than twelve thousand schools the little inset there is a is a a seven Branch Menorah that was carved into the steps of the library that's still visible again confirming a Jewish presence so a book burning in front of such a large and rare Library took on a special significance I'm sure the Librarians or whatever they called the officers in charge of preserving to protecting the documents would have been a gasp hey don't burn those are valuable if you will gladly purchase them for our collection we're known for our magnificent Library how can you do this please stop the sacrilege please let us place valuable and rare items in our collection for others to learn enhance the glory of Ephesus above all it showed the powerful influence that Paul's preaching was having and isn't it interesting that one of the most impressive remains and restorations in ancient Ephesus one of only a few major remains which are even restorable is the Magnificent Stone facade the library even the rocks cry out in testimony and witness of the truth of the Gospel I mentioned three aspects of ancient Ephesus that tie into acts 19's narrative providing context to Luke's account this Library is the first one I will get to the other two shortly so don't go away let's get back to Acts 19 and continue on after these things were ended that is after the more than two-year sojourn in Ephesus the ministry of Miracles through prayer Clause the attack by the possessed on those who tried to use the name of Jesus without possessing The Life of Christ the conversion of practitioners of the occult now the massive book burning Paul purposed in the spirit when he had passed through Macedonia and Ikea to go to Jerusalem and saying after I've been there I must also see Rome in other words after Ephesus Paul planned to go to Macedonia then okay yeah Greece and then on to Jerusalem much as he had done on his previous Journey after that he intended to go to Rome it's the first mention of Paul's desire to go to Rome so he sent ahead of him into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him to mothius the fellow we know is Timothy and erastus but he himself stayed in Asia for a season while they prepared things for his arrival in Macedonia unlike Luke's narrative about the previous missionary Journeys he's not told companions or on this third epic journey of evangelism he hasn't told us about a Barnabas or a Silas We Now find out Timothy was with him as well as a person we have previously met erastus he was later with Paul and Corinth later on this third Journey from which city later it is generally thought that Paul would write the epistle to the Romans Romans 16 1-2 suggests Phoebe of kentria at the other end of the Port Road of Corinth that we think we talked about that 6.8 kilometers because it's in Europe right instead of four miles because it's not in America carried that letter from Corinth to Rome Paul wrote Romans to introduce himself and help prepare for his anticipated arrival a letter of great depth in the basic doctor do you recall which cities were in Macedonia that Paul would be wanting to revisit cities with churches he had started Philippi we recall the conversion of Lydia the Uproar the beating the jailing in stocks the conversion of the Jailer in his household the apology of the magistrates later during Paul's imprisonment in Rome we would get the epistle to the Philippians as part of our very Bible thessalonica a brief ministry here he's only there about three weeks recorded in Acts 17. yet enough was accomplished in that brief space of time that we get two Epistles in our Bible helping that church deal with such questions as must I be alive when the Lord returns to not miss the blessing of eternal life for real here are the people that heard Paul and Silas search the scriptures they didn't want to just take their word for something either do they choose to dismiss it out of hand because it was a different perspective than that with which they were familiar Luke says that they were more noble there were other cities you probably visited Luke mentioned they passed their amphipholus and the Polonia which lie along the road between Philippi and thessalonica they're not otherwise mentioned in the book of Acts but let's get back to Ephesus it's generally accepted that Paul wrote first and second Corinthians during this three-year stay in Ephesus it's likely that he sent Timothy and erastus by Cedar Corinth to deliver the Second Epistle help the church there then head up to Macedonia to meet Paul when he arrived another Point worth mentioning is that Paul's Ministry in Ephesus was long and had huge impact as Luke relates to us throughout acts 19. tremendous impact but what Luke does not mention is that it was by no means easy he talks about the people after three months in the synagogue that pushed back and so he went to a different place but in fact it was arduous and it was dangerous Paul did not for example have the Assurance from the Lord that he would not face persecution in Ephesus remember that he received this in Corinth on his previous Journey acts 18 we read then as he started his ministry in Corinth spake the Lord to Paul in the Night by a vision be not afraid speak don't hold your peace for I am with thee no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for I have much people in this city and Paul continued there a year and six months teaching the word of God among them 18 months free of physical persecution no wonder he stayed we'll see a bit later this evening why this was such a tremendous comfort for Paul in First Corinthians 15. as Paul is pleading with the Corinthians regarding their way of life he refers to his work in Ephesus and alludes to the dangers he constantly faces there and in verse 31 King James version says I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our lord I Die daily if after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus what advantage is it to me if the dead rise not let us eat and drink tomorrow we die the NLT expresses it this way I swear to your brothers and sisters that I face death daily this is as certain as my pride in with Christ Jesus our lord has done in you what value was there in fighting wild beasts those people of Ephesus if there will be no Resurrection from the dead if there's no Resurrection let's feast and drink tomorrow we die he Compares reaching the people of Ephesus fighting wild beasts and I don't think he met squirrels and rabbits consider what he says about this ongoing work in Ephesus in the opening chapter of second Corinthians would have been written towards the end of his day in Ephesus you will note that we when we read it Paul refers to troubles while he was in Asia well remember the first journey he never went there he didn't go to Asia the second Journey he was forbidden to go there at the beginning and just stop briefly in Ephesus to drop off Priscilla and Aquila on his way home in his third Journey he's spending three years in Ephesus and it's only stop in all of Asia for any significant time so the reference in second Corinthians to Asia is a reference to this third Journey's major stop it's a reference to Acts 19. Don't You Love how the New Testament ties us all together so perfectly let's read second Corinthians 1 and 8. for we would not Brethren of Corinth have you ignorant uh you to know of our trouble which came to us in Asia in Ephesus that we were pressed out of measure above strength our strength unable to bear in so much that we despaired even of life of living through these pressures opposition persecution but we had the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in God which raises the Dead the complete Jewish Bible puts it and our hearts we felt we were under sentence of death however this was to get us to rely not on ourselves but on God who raises the Dead verse 10. who delivered us from so great a death and death deliver in whom we trust he will yet Deliver Us again the complete Jewish Bible says he rescued us from such deadly Peril and he will rescue us again the one in whom we have placed Our Hope will indeed continue to rescue us why would he need continual rescue because he's in continual Danger you also helping together by prayer for us for that the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf the other version says You must add your help by praying for us for the more people there are praying the more people there will be to give thanks when their prayer for us is answered this last part reminds me of brother branham's instructions on the prayer Clause that we read last time praise day three times a day resulting in a worldwide band of prayer for the needs of each one here's yet another indication of the troubles Paul had an Ephesus this time it's found in the closing remarks of his letter to the Romans believed to have been written in Corinth after he left Ephesus during the time of Acts chapter 20. Romans 16 it it reads so you know you read and think yeah that's nice right greet Priscilla to Killa my helpers in Christ Jesus who have for my life laid down their own necks unto whom not only I give thanks but also all the churches of the Gentiles what's he saying we see that by the time Paul wrote this letter to the Romans the kill and Priscilla were no longer in Ephesus they'd either already returned to Rome from Ephesus or were accompanying Phoebe as she carried the letter to Rome Paul is telling the recipients of this epistle to the Romans that these two have risked their lives risked death by beheading on his behalf in conjunction with these other references it's pretty clear that Paul is referring to events in Ephesus During the period covered in Acts 19. knowledge of this ever present danger to Paul and the effect it had on him and observed by others will help us better understand Acts 19 verses 30 and 31. we'll get to those verses in just a few minutes I will keep you here all night I promise a final recall this time from Acts 19. verses 8 and 9. and he Paul went into the synagogue and Ephesus and spoke boldly for the space of three months disputing and persuading a method of teaching as we discussed last time the things concerning the kingdom of God but when divers would some of the participants in these discussions were hardened they couldn't defend their stance or defeat Paul's or unwilling to change and believe not what Paul was saying but spake evil of that way of Christianity before the multitude they verbally attacked Paul attacked his teaching speaking evil indicates this became personal it's no longer a method of teaching and learning they reviled discredited publicly maligned the way Christianity that Jesus was a messiah then he Paul departed from them he left their synagogue separated the disciples the students the Believers the followers of Christ that came with him from that synagogue disputing daily no longer in the synagogue but instead teaching using this method of dialogue and persuasion in the school of one taranis when we get to acts 21 and verse 27 for those of you that look ahead sometimes you'll again meet some of these people from Ephesus who rejected the gospel these guys are relentless and their pursuit of Paul much as Saul of Tarsus was relentless at his pursuit of the earliest Christians when we see what transpires in Acts 21 it will help us realize how real the danger was to Paul while he was in Ephesus you'll see what these guys accomplish yet he remained there just sparing of life itself for three long years stay tuned moving on now with Luke's narrative and Acts 19 moving on to verse 23. at the same time that he made his decision to go to Jerusalem in Rome and sent the two brothers on ahead to Macedonia there arose no small stir in Ephesus about that way that is the spread of Christianity for a certain man named Demetrius a silversmith which made silver shrines for Diana brought no small gain under the Craftsman Demetrius you're going to be on here in a minute buddy whom he called together with workmen of like occupation this Demetrius is apparently a very skilled silversmith he keeps a number of workers Craftsman employed the whole group of people working this Trader doing well financially by this arrangement the product line consists of Idols shrines and so forth focused on worship of this Goddess Diana not unlike selling crucifixes to Catholics or icons to Orthodox Christians Demetrius has called together this group later centuries the equivalent of a guild or or a union and along with other Smiths and Craftsmen engaged in this business of their livelihood and said seriously he knows that's by this craft we ever love point one we make our living by fabricating items of worship for Diana this is a statue of Diana also known as Artemis goddess of the hunt and fertility it's about nine feet tall Demetrius and his fellow silversmiths were making smaller silver idols and such for tourists and pilgrims worshipers of Diana but wait there's more almost throughout all Asia this call had persuaded and turned away much would show that not only this our craft is in danger to be said to not but also that the Temple of the Great Warrior Asian Asia and the world worship Asia and the whole world worship Diana can you imagine and when they heard these sayings they were full of Wrath it's now an angry mob and they cried out saying hey I smells like a riot might be coming on here but that wow that's a very you made that that silver whoa that'll make a great breastplate would well I don't know what this is worth but with this Riot and stuff you think I can get a discount hey take two bucks for it thanks Demetrius [Applause] question why would they say Diana of the Ephesians why not Diana of Mount Olympus or just say greatest Diana what makes this goddess one that they seem so possessive of in Ephesus I've highlighted here the location of the Temple of Diana that Demetrius refers to let's take a closer look this is the second of the three features of Ephesus that I mentioned that are applicable to Acts 19. Ephesus was known throughout the ancient world not even so much for its library but primarily for its Temple of Artemis also called Diana in fact this if it's a temple Temple this building was one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world when you hear of the Seven Wonders of the World Ephesus was a city this was a temple the other six were the Colossus of Rhodes the Hanging Gardens of Babylon a certain statue of zuza a tomb of some guy named masalos the great pyramid at Giza and the Lighthouse at Alexandria this Temple was a big deal by the way of those seven wonders of the ancient world it's only the Great Pyramid of Giza that still stands today I had to sneak in a personal photo from our 50th wedding anniversary trip to Egypt it was at the height of covert restrictions so there were very few other tourists but back to the Temple of Diana quoting from National Geographic and Ephesus the ancient city in what is now Western turkey a temple was constructed that was reportedly so magnificent it caused Philo of Byzantium all right she's not my neighbor I don't know him either but whoever he was he said I've seen the walls and hanging gardens of ancient Babylon been there the statue of Olympian Zeus the Colossus of Rhodes the mighty work of the high pyramids the tomb of masalus but when I saw the temple at Ephesus rising to the clouds all these other wonders were put in the shade of course it would attract pilgrims to see its magnificence and then purchase the Diana souvenir or Idol to worship or something but if you go to Ephesus now unlike those Pyramids of Giza here's what you'll see of this Great temple this wonder of the ancient world one partially restored column that's it just one a few Foundation Stones here and there I think the inset at the bottom of the picture is a is a model of the temple on the grounds of a museum in Istanbul Istanbul Turkey just to give you an idea of the contrast here can you begin to see the scale of the success of the ministry of the Holy Spirit through Paul in Ephesus let's get back to that angry mob inspired by Demetrius the whole city was filled with confusion why are these guys stirred up what's going on I don't know let's go find out and having caught Gaius and aristarchus men of Macedonia Outsiders not Ephesians not worshipers of Diana but rather they are Paul's Companions and travel they the mob rushed with one Accord into the theater the amphitheater a place of public assembly and when Paul would have entered in to the amphitheater to help his companions Gaius and aristarchus he would have entered in unto the people the disciples the Believers his followers suffered him not they prevented him from getting in I don't know if they talked him out of it they hugged him out of it I don't know but they kept him out of it and certain of the chief of Asia some of the bigwigs in Ephesus powerful leaders are influential men maybe they were converts and maybe they weren't but regardless says they were his friends senator Paul Desiring him that he would not Adventure himself into the theater these Chief men along with the various disciples convinced Paul or restrained him from entering the amphitheater was dangerous recall the dangers and troubles Paul faced in Ephesus that he shared with the Corinthians in both of his letters which we read earlier meanwhile in the amphitheater some therefore cried one thing and some another for the assembly was confused the more apart knew not wherefore they were come together well I just saw those guys running and I'm running into I was driving down the freeway and everybody slowed down and I looked too most of the people were gawkers I saw a crowd Gathering went along to see what's going on what's causing this big disturbance a flash mob without social media it's time to take a look at the third feature of Ephesus that plays a role in Acts 19. the amphitheater this shows its relative location but this is the amphitheater it's a huge place of public gathering remember they had no PA systems no microphones loudspeakers the structure was designed so that if a person stood in the right place and the crowd was still that person could be heard by everyone everyone it looks pretty big right that's not just big it's gigantic by the standards of the day even by the San Jose it could seat 24 000 people that's like half the population of Ephesus if you've ever been in a stadium for a football or a baseball game or even indoors or basketball you know how hard it is to hear the announcer and that's with modern electronic systems and the Capitol building in Washington DC have you ever been in the Rotunda if a person stands in a certain spot and you stand another certain spot and that person Whispers that person Whispers you can hear that person they can't keep a secret the amphitheater of Ephesus was a Marvel of acoustic engineering Applied Mathematics and physics Stone construction and excavation it had to be deceit 24 000 people and everyone be able to hear the speaker and the majority of its construction is marble marble rich elegant even in in this small Auditorium of juice on Tabernacle with our excellent sound system I often speak too soft speak too Softly I need to be reminded to speak up with that said let's go back to Acts 19. let's enter that Ephesian Amphitheater let's listen let's see what's going on and they drew Alexander out of the multitude the Jews putting him forward so there's this big crowd and the Jewish people there say Alexander why Alexander a Jewish man was he a follower of Jesus Paul mentions a couple of Alexanders but they don't appear to be him it's probably not a Christian but at this time Christianity was considered to be a branch of Judaism Christians went to the synagogic Jews went to the synagogue they're Jews the crowd has riled up about anyone who is opposed to Diana the silversmiths right so Alexander beckoned with a hand silence so he could be heard he would have made his defense unto the people but when the flash mob knew that he was a Jew all with one voice about the space of two hours crying out great is Diana of the Ephesians great is Diana of the Ephesians that repeated it like a chant when the town clerk at the translation say mayor a figure with some Authority had appease he quieted the people it's apparently took two hours he said you men of Ephesus what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshiper of the Great Goddess Diana and of the image which fell down from Jupiter I'm on your side just keep listening seeing that these things cannot be spoken against you ought to be quiet do nothing rashly it's ridiculous to think otherwise think this through you've brought hither these men which are neither robbers of our temples or blasphemers of your goddess so if Demetrius and the Craftsman that are with him this guy in front row right over here if Demetrius or the Craftsman that are with him he's letting them know that he knows who the instigators of this are have a matter against any man the law is open the courts are available we have deputies judges let them bring charges against one another and plead means to bring charges but if you inquire anything concerning other matters it shall be determined in a lawful assembly and the courts not here for we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this Concourse this disturbance this disorderly Gathering Rome was always fearful and always trying to appease the mob a riot like this could result in the downfall of many civil officials suppression of certain rights and so forth remember Pilots fear of repercussions of a mob right in Jerusalem was the final pressure that caused him to order the crucifixion of Jesus to satisfy the mob and when he the town clerk had thus spoken he dismissed the assembly when Paul was traveling he spent considerable time in certain locations 18 months in Corinth on his second Journey a few years in Ephesus on his third during these days he wrote some of the Epistles that are now part of our new testament I've already mentioned the two letters to the Corinthians he wrote from Ephesus as well as a letter to the Romans is believed to have been written from Corinth towards the end of this journey while there's some controversy over what he did or did not write or uncertainty about when this journey occurred or what year that was and so forth there's General agreement on many of his letters for example the two letters to the Thessalonians were written during his long stay in Corinth and acts 18 during the second Journey Galatians is believed to have been written during that second Journey as well as brother Daniel mentioned II Timothy the very last letter we know of that Paul wrote was just prior to his execution in Rome well since Paul is still in Ephesus at the end of tonight's chapter let's consider for a moment another passage in First Corinthians recall from acts 18 which you read earlier this evening that Paul had Assurance from the Lord that no evil would be fallen in Corinth and he stayed at least a year and a half in the past before this acts study I didn't give a lot of thought as to when Paul might have written the Epistles to the Corinthians or the context of his and their situation but context is so important now I know that the Corinthian letters were written while Paul was in Ephesus during Acts 19. we just read about the difficulties he was having at Ephesus that he shared with the Corinthians let's listen as Paul recounts some of the trials and sufferings he has sustained up to that point in time in order to bring the good news to the Corinthians and others Paul's reacting to news from corn things he's spending a considerable part of this letter defending his ministry and it's part of a warning against false teaching and false apostles but he relates some startling facts some things that have occurred during this time that we've been up to this point and asked he says in second Corinthians chapter 11 and verse 24. of the Jews five times received by 40 Stripes save one 39 lashes with whips five times why was it limited to that number Deuteronomy 25 1-3 Moses says never more than 40. Luke tells us nothing of this in Acts false back must have been a sight with so many scars he says three times Thrice was I beaten with rods we read of one time in Philippi but now we learned there were two other times that weren't recorded in Acts once I was stoned that was in lystra during the first journey and we know that he was killed then Thrice three times I suffered shipwreck a night and a day I've been in the Deep drifting hanging on to something to float we know nothing of these incidents except they must have occurred during the times that we've covered so far in Acts do you recall I pointed out on that map the many tiny islands and rocks that are in that part of the Aegean Sea so this had to have been when he was crossing through there I used to think when I read this that oh the shipwrecks and that bad stuff that happened on his journey to Rome we read all about the big shipwreck there this is before he ever got to Rome so that would come years later he goes along and journeyings often and perils dangers of waters in Perils of robbers and perils by my own countrymen five times 39 stripes in perils by the heathen stoned lystra and perils in this city and perils in the wilderness perils in the sea in perils among false brethren this was hard this was long this was difficult not flying commercial staying in nice hotel speaking to receptive people and comfortable churches in weariness sheer physical exhaustion painfulness in watchings that's sleepless nights often in hunger and thirst and fastings involuntarily without food often shivering and cold and nakedness exposure inadequate clothing Paul was continually In Harm's Way he must have often thought about what the Lord showed him in Damascus at the time of his own conversion which brother Daniel shared with us in Acts 9. verse 13. the Lord has told ananias to go to the street called straight and you'll find this guy Paul and pray for him because he's had this vision and his sight to be restored ananias answered Lord I have heard by many of this man how much evil he has done to thy Saints at Jerusalem and here he has Authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on your name in other words Lord I'd rather not go pray for this guy but the Lord said unto ananias go thy way go to Saul do what I've told you to do he's a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel for I will show him how great things he must suffer how much he will suffer for my name's sake Paul endured many hard physical sufferings and torments we were talking about this one evening and Heather suggested me it was no wonder he had Luke with him so often maybe not only is a fellow evangelist but also is a trusted personal physician to help attend to the physical care of his damaged broken hurting body remember we read where he asked the Lord three different times to take away this one particular thing and the Lord said Paul I'm not going to do it I'm aware of it and I care my grace is sufficient but something weighed even more heavily on Paul than all of these back to Second Corinthians 11 verse 28. beside all those things that are without those things I just listed beatings and hunger and shipwreck physical danger my greatest burden is that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches right when I read that I my mind flashed back to when I was 13 years old and the the day that President Kennedy was shot and the plane flew back to Andrews Air Force Base and Lyndon Johnson came out of the plane and he stood by the microphones there and he said his his last phrase of a very short speech I will do my best that's all I can do I ask for your help and gods my brothers and my sisters please remember thinking of this verse to pray for our Pastor Daniel every single day the burden of caring for this Fellowship weighs heavily on him we should help bear one another's burdens this is how we fulfill the law of Christ to love one another and not just with words as we progress through the rest of Acts consider the circumstances the context of Paul's life and experiences and the context of the lives of the people he ministered to and of the cities where the Believers lived who receive his letters when you read his Epistles ask yourself why is Paul addressing this topic with this group at this time nothing is random here it's all in God's control and in his hands as are we if we'll accept his love and grace through Jesus Christ if you have not done so anyone here I urge you do not leave tonight until you know that you've met him and he has met you establish that connection a relationship so that on that final day he won't turn to you and say depart from me because I never knew you oops I'd like to close this evening with the song I learned back in 1965 when I was 15 years old if the musicians would please return no it's not all night yet okay my family lived in San Jose California at that time we attended Saint Timothy's Lutheran Church pastored by brother lynhart this is before we'd ever heard of the ministry of brother Branham brother lynhart later became an associate pastor here at Tucson Tabernacle he serves as a congregation for about 35 years anyway I was elected president of the Luther League the church's young people's group brother Lenhart suggested to me that the young people of the church should attend a singspiration one evening I don't recall how many of us went I did I remember two of my best friends were there at the time the event was free of admission charge it was in a large local church the person leading it was none other than Audrey Meyer she was a gifted Christian musician who was inspired to write many gospel songs she grew up in La I think 1916 to 1996 that Forest Lawn Cemetery where Amy sepel McPherson is buried she's buried there as well she was part of Amy sample McPherson's Church experience there in the 20s and 30s but she wrote most if not all the songs that we sang that evening and I'd like us to sing one of the songs she wrote and which we sang as we close this part of the service his name is wonderful his name is

let's stand I want to ask you a question but the Lyle touched on it think about those great wonders those great man-built Wonders that we see we see the one pillar standing which one was that the Temple of Diane and Corinth right in Ephesus the the Temple of Diana one of the greatest wonders look what stands today nothing one pillar you wouldn't know what was there you know there's a few there's a few pyramids left all of these other things have been destroyed but let me tell you something every single one of those people that were led to the Lord Jesus Christ are alive today 2 000 years later because a man took it upon himself to follow the leading of the Lord and lead these people to everlasting life to the Son of God Jesus Christ to the point where they would they would burn these books these most the most valuable things in the world they'd throw them down and burn them they mean nothing to me I think that just blessed me I thought Lord nothing is left nothing that man can build is eternal but what God builds is eternal but allow mentioned but allow mentioned a youth meeting we're having a youth meeting on August the 26th I mentioned it before and let me tell you

these people in those churches he loved them he loved him so much that [Music] that he would risk his life and and he would be beaten stoned and everything else but those people meant something to the Apostle Brother David if you would if you'd come up and close my brother let's sing that song again brother Aaron his name is wonderful [Music] Jesus I know he is [Music] is wonderful Jesus [Music]
