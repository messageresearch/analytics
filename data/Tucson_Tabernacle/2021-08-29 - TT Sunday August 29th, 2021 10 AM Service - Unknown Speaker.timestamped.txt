[19:25] amen you may be seated
[19:28] um first i want to thank sister leah i
[19:30] apologize you're not in trouble
[19:33] i've just had a sort of mindset about
[19:35] what i wanted to do today not exactly an
[19:37] exactitude of what i want to do
[19:41] um
[19:44] brother aaron i'm just gonna assume you
[19:45] can hear me if we have all the prayer
[19:47] requests we're gonna
[19:48] we're gonna get started on that we just
[19:50] have a praise
[19:52] from brother robert chacon i want to
[19:54] give god the honor and glory for his
[19:56] mercy and grace in my life i got a good
[19:58] report from my doctor
[20:00] and also my blood test came back
[20:02] negative thank you for your prayers
[20:08] [Applause]
[20:11] i'm just talking to brother matt in the
[20:13] back and
[20:14] his mother-in-law has been going through
[20:16] a lot of pain
[20:17] sounds like it's something
[20:20] dental or an ear infection or a double
[20:24] ear infection it just sounds terrible so
[20:26] we're gonna
[20:27] we're gonna remember her today
[20:31] brother ed also passed along that
[20:33] brother nate dugal fell and injured his
[20:36] arm and is asking for prayer
[20:38] so we're going to pray for that
[20:41] but what i wanted to do different today
[20:43] was
[20:44] one of my least favorite things about
[20:46] how we sit is how far apart we are
[20:50] and one of my favorite songs is
[20:51] hallelujah
[20:53] and that is a prayer and that's a praise
[20:55] and that's a worship
[20:57] so
[20:58] i'm not coming after you
[21:01] if you are able and you would like to
[21:03] i want us to filter towards the middle
[21:05] don't come down just come towards the
[21:07] middle and we are going to pray and sing
[21:10] for about 10 to 15 minutes
[21:12] and we're going to sing hallelujah and
[21:14] we're going to worship the lord so
[21:17] brother jeremy can you put me on the
[21:18] purple one
[21:20] so if you want to stand up and move i
[21:22] would love that i'm coming down to the
[21:23] middle
[21:25] and we're going to do that this morning
[21:26] and we're just going to
[21:29] we're just going to praise the lord
[21:34] i have not wanted to do it in part
[21:35] sometimes because it feels like a
[21:37] gimmick
[21:38] but it won't be if we don't make it one
[21:42] so i'm just going gonna start singing

[40:41] thank you lord psalms chapter 107 if you
[40:43] have your bible we'll go straight to the
[40:44] word this morning
[40:46] amen i'd like to just say hello
[40:48] amen i greet you in the name of the lord
[40:51] and it's certainly a privilege to be
[40:53] here appreciate by the matthew
[40:55] i know that's not a
[40:57] an easy thing to do to lead worship like
[40:59] that acapella but you don't need music
[41:02] or instruments or
[41:04] even voices even hands you don't need
[41:06] anything to worship the lord because
[41:08] worship comes from the innermost part of
[41:10] your being
[41:12] amen psalms chapter 107 i just want to
[41:16] take a thought here this morning and i
[41:19] just would just say that the lord has
[41:22] dealt with me and changed my course
[41:24] completely
[41:25] even this morning i was just praying
[41:27] about what direction to go and then had
[41:29] a direction and the lord just turned my
[41:31] course
[41:32] and turned me
[41:33] completely to the side so you just trust
[41:36] that whatever it is that you need god
[41:39] knows all about it
[41:40] whatever it is that you have a desire
[41:43] for even before you could ask it the
[41:45] lord already
[41:47] knows do you believe that
[41:49] amen i'm so thankful for that psalms
[41:51] chapter
[41:53] 107 and let's just begin reading here at
[41:56] verse 23.
[41:59] i spoke on this along the lines of this
[42:01] during the time that we were in uh
[42:03] quarantine or separated through we were
[42:06] doing the live streaming and lord just
[42:08] pulled me back this direction again so
[42:11] i'd like to speak to you this morning
[42:14] on a place called wit's end
[42:16] a place called wit's
[42:19] end
[42:20] and i'm not talking about adventures in
[42:21] odyssey wits in either for all you
[42:24] adventures and odyssey listeners
[42:28] something completely different let's
[42:29] look at this here together
[42:32] verse 23 they that go down
[42:34] to the sea and ships
[42:36] that do business in great waters
[42:39] these see the works of the lord
[42:42] and his wonders in the deep
[42:44] for he commandeth and raiseth the stormy
[42:47] wind
[42:48] which lifteth up the waves thereof
[42:51] they mount up to the heaven they go down
[42:54] again to the depths
[42:56] their soul is melted
[42:58] because of trouble
[43:00] they reel to and fro
[43:03] and stagger like a drunken man
[43:06] and are at their
[43:09] wit's end
[43:11] then they cry unto the lord in their
[43:13] trouble
[43:14] and he bringeth them out of their
[43:16] distresses
[43:17] he maketh the storm
[43:19] a calm
[43:21] so that the waves thereof
[43:23] are still
[43:25] let's just bow our heads here together
[43:27] if you have a need maybe something upon
[43:29] your heart while your head or heads are
[43:31] bowed won't you just raise that up to
[43:33] the lord by an uplifted hand
[43:35] lord jesus we're thankful for your
[43:39] your presence lord that's in this place
[43:42] thankful lord god that we have
[43:44] a place where we can go to
[43:47] lord a building where we could gather
[43:49] lord not bound or
[43:51] in bondage
[43:53] from sin not bound in bondage by
[43:56] dead religion
[43:58] lord but we're free
[44:00] today lord because you set us free we're
[44:03] your sons and more daughters lord god we
[44:05] we're your children now lord may you
[44:07] come father and move me out of the way
[44:10] completely
[44:11] lord i pray that you would just have
[44:13] your way
[44:14] i believe lord jesus you have something
[44:16] that you want to say
[44:17] may you do it may you speak it lord we
[44:20] ask
[44:20] and we'll give you all the glory
[44:22] all the honor
[44:24] all the praise lord may you meet these
[44:26] needs by these uplifted hands we ask in
[44:28] jesus christ's name
[44:30] and the church said
[44:32] amen you can be seated this morning
[44:40] david
[44:41] is describing here and he says here in
[44:44] verse 23 we'll just read it again
[44:47] they that go down
[44:48] to the sea and ships that do business in
[44:51] great waters
[44:52] these see the works of the lord and his
[44:54] wonders
[44:55] in the deep
[44:57] for he commandeth and raiseth the stormy
[44:59] wind which lifteth up the waves
[45:03] thereof
[45:04] they mount up to the heaven they go down
[45:06] again into the depths their soul is
[45:08] melted
[45:09] because of trouble they reel to and fro
[45:12] and stagger like a drunken man
[45:15] and are at their
[45:17] wit's end
[45:18] he's speaking here of a sailor one who
[45:20] knows
[45:21] the sea one who knows his boat
[45:24] and he's tossed here in this storm
[45:28] and it's an incredible thing that how
[45:31] much the bible speaks about
[45:34] storms
[45:35] and even through the life of david
[45:38] there's many
[45:40] psalms there's two or three other
[45:42] that speak
[45:43] similar things like this we know that
[45:45] jesus spoke to storms
[45:48] jesus was in storms the apostle paul
[45:52] was also a man who the bible chooses to
[45:55] give us a detail of his life
[45:58] about a shipwreck
[45:59] from a storm
[46:01] i thought it's interesting the lord
[46:02] turned me this direction even this
[46:04] morning and there's a great storm
[46:06] approaching louisiana i want to be in
[46:08] prayer for those that are in the path of
[46:10] that hurricane and that storm
[46:12] but it's incredible because this storm
[46:14] that david is speaking of here
[46:17] he says they they reel to and fro and
[46:20] they stagger like a drunken man these
[46:22] giant waves that are coming against
[46:25] their ship uh
[46:27] he says that it drops them down to the
[46:30] depths and the the powerful winds toss
[46:33] them back and forth so that
[46:36] there is no control they've lost all
[46:38] control and all ability to to control
[46:42] the ship anymore they've just lost it
[46:45] completely and entirely
[46:47] and the sailors
[46:48] are
[46:49] are crying out the bible says they
[46:51] stagger
[46:52] they weren't drunk but they staggered
[46:55] like drunk men they didn't know what to
[46:57] do it's amazing when you lose control of
[46:59] your vessel when you lose control of
[47:02] what god has given you to get you from
[47:05] one place to the other
[47:06] and paul had found that out when he
[47:09] loses control of the ship that he was in
[47:13] to accomplish the mission that god had
[47:15] for him but now that ship had broken up
[47:17] in pieces and paul finds himself in the
[47:20] ocean clinging to a piece of what used
[47:23] to carry him
[47:25] and this is very similar to what these
[47:27] sailors david is speaking of are going
[47:30] through they have lost
[47:32] all ability they have came to their wits
[47:36] in they stagger across the the cells to
[47:39] the ship are tattered and ripped and
[47:42] wave after wave powerful waves crash
[47:45] onto the deck and these sailors are just
[47:48] struggling to do everything they can
[47:50] just to hold on
[47:52] just to make it and it looks like it's
[47:55] over looks like everything is just going
[47:58] to end in total despair
[48:01] they're helpless they're vulnerable
[48:04] and it's the power of the elements
[48:07] and they're unable to stop the storm
[48:10] paddle powerless
[48:11] to save themselves
[48:13] and the bible's david says they've
[48:15] reached this place
[48:17] called
[48:18] wits in
[48:20] it's a place that we all are very
[48:22] familiar with in our own life and our
[48:24] own journey of life that we reach many
[48:26] times
[48:27] to where we give all control and we've
[48:29] lost all ability well uh whatever you
[48:32] did there brother jeremy if you could
[48:34] change it back i uh being able to hear
[48:36] myself this tucson dryness dries my
[48:38] throat out so i need that thank you amen
[48:41] god bless you
[48:42] but but they they have lost all ability
[48:45] and and they are they're in a place of
[48:48] wits in where they're totally helpless
[48:50] unable to
[48:52] help themselves it's the phrase means
[48:54] that they've lost
[48:56] or they've exhausted
[48:59] any possibility of perceiving or
[49:01] thinking of a way
[49:03] out of the trouble
[49:07] they've in short what you could say is
[49:09] this was the end of human ability it's
[49:13] the end of human resources
[49:16] it's the end of human intervention
[49:19] there's no escape there's no human help
[49:22] there's no
[49:23] there's no lifeboat there's no way for
[49:26] them to save themselves it's going to
[49:30] take
[49:31] god
[49:33] that's what it means when he speaks of
[49:36] wits in it's a place where they've
[49:38] reached all ability
[49:40] uh they've really
[49:42] reached a place of complete human
[49:45] ability has been exhausted
[49:48] and they can no longer trust
[49:51] in themselves
[49:54] or their ability to save themselves
[49:57] i'm going to read you some scriptures
[49:59] here from jeremiah you don't have to
[50:00] turn but it says thus sayeth the lord is
[50:02] speaking of
[50:03] trust
[50:04] thus saith the lord cursed be the man
[50:08] that trusteth in man
[50:13] cursed be the man
[50:15] that trusteth
[50:17] in man
[50:19] now it's not just speaking of
[50:22] trusting of yourself but trusting
[50:24] any man or any flesh
[50:27] he goes on he says and maketh flesh
[50:30] his arm and whose heart departeth from
[50:33] the lord for he shall be like a heath
[50:37] in the desert
[50:38] and shall not see
[50:40] when good cometh
[50:42] but shall inhabit the parched places
[50:46] in the wilderness
[50:48] in assault land
[50:50] and not
[50:52] inhabited
[50:53] it's amazing how much we cling to human
[50:56] ability even as believers and christians
[50:59] and we trust completely and entirely in
[51:02] the lord but you know in times of
[51:04] calamity in times of distress and in
[51:06] time of a storm
[51:08] and you know i'm just going to say this
[51:10] here today there's a reason the lord
[51:12] has me preaching on this today
[51:14] somebody's in a storm
[51:16] in this building
[51:18] and it's amazing how much we cling on to
[51:21] our ability to save ourselves though
[51:24] trusting in the lord it's amazing how
[51:26] much we cling even to a place to where
[51:29] we've came through so much and we've the
[51:31] lord has brought us
[51:33] that we can all here just testify
[51:36] all of us here today would have a
[51:38] testimony of the grace of god that has
[51:40] brought us to today's date
[51:43] the only reason you're here in your
[51:44] right mind with a mind and a heart to
[51:47] want to worship and serve the lord
[51:50] there's only one reason and that's
[51:52] because of overwhelming grace
[51:55] that god has bestowed in our life that
[51:57] has kept us
[51:59] day by day
[52:00] how did you get here ask yourself that
[52:03] question this morning how did i arrive
[52:06] here at church
[52:08] in august
[52:09] of 2021 how did i get here i could look
[52:12] back at my life and through the journey
[52:14] of my life and boy i could say there's
[52:17] been a lot of good times lord's done a
[52:19] lot of good things for me there's been a
[52:21] lot of happy moments there's been a lot
[52:23] of times where i've rejoiced but oh as i
[52:26] look over
[52:27] down the road that i've traveled there's
[52:29] been a lot of times that were hard a lot
[52:32] of times where i struggled a lot of
[52:35] times where i had to fight with tooth
[52:37] and nail just to make it to wake up and
[52:40] get out of bed that morning
[52:42] am i preaching to anybody today that's
[52:44] maybe came through hard times
[52:47] you could say i've been through a lot
[52:48] i've been through a lot of struggle i've
[52:51] had to bury loved ones i've had to
[52:54] to not even have a i've struggled to
[52:56] have an understanding to make sense out
[52:58] of what's happened there's been a lot of
[53:00] good there's been a lot of rejoicing
[53:02] there's been a lot of happy but there's
[53:04] been a lot of sadness there's been a lot
[53:06] of sorrow there's been a lot of loss
[53:09] because that's what this life is
[53:11] really about
[53:13] this life
[53:15] the bible says a man is a few days and
[53:19] full of trouble
[53:23] it's a few days and full of trouble
[53:28] really if we'd be honest that's really
[53:29] what life is it's full of trouble
[53:32] it's full of struggle the entire life
[53:35] even as a believer brother matt but
[53:36] you're a christian yeah i'm a christian
[53:38] and that's when i realized the struggle
[53:40] that i'm really in is when i got born
[53:42] again
[53:43] i really understood that that life is
[53:46] all about a death cycle that the from
[53:48] the moment the baby is born i heard a
[53:51] man recently say he said we we've got it
[53:53] backwards we ought to be mourning over
[53:55] the birth and rejoicing over the death
[54:01] if you really think of real reality
[54:03] because when you're born into this world
[54:05] it's a few days and full
[54:08] of trouble
[54:10] and some of us have had our fair share
[54:12] and some of us could tell can look back
[54:14] over life's journey and say it's not
[54:16] been easy there's been easy times but
[54:18] it's been a struggle and it's been hard
[54:21] and i've had to struggle to fight and
[54:24] and but you say but brother man but it's
[54:26] been a struggle but let me just remind
[54:28] you my dear brother my dear sister who's
[54:31] came through some hard times and some
[54:34] hardships and some great storms let me
[54:36] just remind you look around you're still
[54:39] here
[54:41] you're still here you're still going to
[54:43] hard something inside you to worship the
[54:45] lord you still are raising your hand
[54:47] saying amen to the word of god you still
[54:50] have your right mind you say how did i
[54:52] arrive here today because one day
[54:55] yesterday god had grace and the day
[54:56] before that he had grace and if he
[54:58] brought if grace is what brought me to
[55:00] today i can trust that it will be grace
[55:03] that will keep me
[55:05] tomorrow
[55:10] it's all grace
[55:13] and it's been he he says and shall not
[55:15] see
[55:16] in a salt land and not a habited blessed
[55:18] is he and you've been through a lot
[55:20] through the deep it's incredible
[55:22] because though we've been through so
[55:24] much
[55:25] yet we always as believers every one of
[55:28] us none of us are exempt we can come to
[55:31] this place of wits in where we just want
[55:34] to give up
[55:37] we just want to
[55:39] throw the white flag of surrender and
[55:42] and just walk out
[55:46] and if we'd be honest some of us are
[55:48] facing that
[55:50] emotion
[55:52] because that's what it is it's an
[55:53] emotion
[55:55] some of us are facing that emotion of
[55:58] giving up
[55:59] just giving up and
[56:02] it's incredible
[56:03] even some who've been through so much
[56:06] and god has brought you through so much
[56:09] yet the darkest is right before the dawn
[56:12] the darkest night is right before the
[56:14] dawn it gets brother branham said it
[56:16] gets to that place the most dangerous
[56:18] time to drive is not in the night he
[56:21] says but it's in the in the du he says
[56:23] right before the sun comes up right at
[56:26] dawn that's what he called it and he
[56:28] said right at dawn right before the sun
[56:31] comes he says that's the most dangerous
[56:33] times when the sun's setting and the
[56:35] sun's rising because it's not completely
[56:37] dark it's not light yet and he says it's
[56:40] hazy and you can't really see your way
[56:44] you can't really see your way too clear
[56:47] and it's incredible because some of the
[56:49] greatest
[56:50] some of the the greatest strongest
[56:53] feeling of giving up and giving over and
[56:57] quitting on god comes right before
[57:01] deliverance
[57:06] right before god is about to deliver you
[57:10] and you have made it through the deep
[57:14] seas of life
[57:16] and you've made it through the deep
[57:18] troubles and god has kept you through
[57:20] the ocean the deep of the the sea when
[57:22] it was when when when if you did fall in
[57:25] the water you would have drowned but now
[57:27] you're in shallow water now you're
[57:30] almost to the shore now you're almost to
[57:32] the other side and right when you're in
[57:35] and right when you're almost out of it
[57:38] and shallow water
[57:39] is when you have this feeling
[57:42] of giving up it's amazing because people
[57:44] drown in shallow water
[57:47] and sometimes people drown in shallow
[57:49] water can sometimes people can make it
[57:52] through deep water but drown in the
[57:53] shallows
[57:55] are you here today
[57:58] i said sometimes people make it through
[58:00] the deepest struggles
[58:02] and then allow satan to destroy them in
[58:04] the shallow water
[58:06] when they could when when they when they
[58:09] when they could make it when they could
[58:11] handle it when they could go on but they
[58:14] they give up they throw in the towel
[58:16] they've reached wit's end
[58:19] and they've survived so much they've
[58:22] been through so much
[58:24] and it's incredible
[58:26] it's it's incredible
[58:28] but the toughest part of the struggle
[58:32] is not in the beginning of the struggle
[58:36] the trump is part of the trial
[58:38] you know
[58:39] when you're strong and you're vibrant
[58:41] and you've got faith and you've got
[58:43] energy and and it's the beginning the
[58:45] toughest times let me say this the
[58:48] toughest toughest times of life are not
[58:51] at the beginning uh uh because the
[58:54] struggle that you come into you've got
[58:56] you've got you've got faith you've got
[58:58] hope you've got love you're vibrant
[59:00] you're ready
[59:02] but it's when you are closest to the
[59:05] shore
[59:06] that you are the most vulnerable
[59:09] to collapsing
[59:15] when you are the most
[59:17] when you are the closest to the finish
[59:20] line
[59:22] you know you see that a marathon runners
[59:24] and they've ran and they've endured mile
[59:25] after mile after mile and just going in
[59:28] water and going and going and going but
[59:30] man when they see that finish line you
[59:32] watch some of them almost ready to
[59:34] collapse
[59:36] right before you're about to cross over
[59:38] right before you're about to finish your
[59:41] race
[59:44] even i was hearing even some of this
[59:46] what i'm speaking about today is
[59:49] hearing a minister speak on this and it
[59:51] was he gave it a statistic that was just
[59:54] mind-blowing
[59:55] that most fatal accidents
[59:59] car accidents happen within a mile to
[1:00:01] two miles from the house
[1:00:06] when you're almost home just a mile or
[1:00:08] two away
[1:00:10] when you've already made it through and
[1:00:12] you've already driven through and and
[1:00:13] now
[1:00:14] now you're you're this close this close
[1:00:17] to be
[1:00:18] home not 20 not 30 not 40 miles not 10
[1:00:21] miles but sometimes when you're the
[1:00:23] closest to shore
[1:00:25] is when you're the most vulnerable
[1:00:28] to giving up
[1:00:30] and things can become the most
[1:00:33] difficult
[1:00:34] are you here today
[1:00:36] say amen
[1:00:39] they come to this place called wits in
[1:00:43] and they've they come to that storm to
[1:00:46] where you don't hear the voice of the
[1:00:47] lord so clearly and you don't and even
[1:00:51] even even even just a whisper sometimes
[1:00:54] the voice of the lord drowns down and is
[1:00:57] drowned out by this by the the
[1:00:59] circumstances
[1:01:01] and all you hear is just a whisper
[1:01:04] from the lord and job got to the place
[1:01:06] to where he could say how i got children
[1:01:09] who have died
[1:01:10] i've got family who have lost
[1:01:13] and job comes to this place and says i
[1:01:15] can't see the lord
[1:01:17] i can't see him he even comes in the
[1:01:20] book of job and says i can't perceive
[1:01:22] him
[1:01:23] i've looked left and he's not there i
[1:01:25] look right and he's not there i've i've
[1:01:28] searched
[1:01:29] high and low and he says and i just
[1:01:31] can't perceive them he was there but now
[1:01:34] i can't find him has anybody ever felt
[1:01:36] that way i looked on one side and i
[1:01:39] couldn't find him i can't perceive him
[1:01:41] where is he at
[1:01:46] and sometimes if we're not careful
[1:01:48] we allow the devil to sell us a lie that
[1:01:52] the presence of a storm
[1:01:54] means the absence of god
[1:01:58] and some of us have bought into a lie
[1:02:00] that just because we're in difficult
[1:02:02] tough hard struggles that the presence
[1:02:06] of great trial
[1:02:08] must mean the absence but let me tell
[1:02:10] you sometimes
[1:02:12] it's the very opposite to a child of god
[1:02:14] the presence of your struggle is proof
[1:02:17] of the creator that he's in the middle
[1:02:20] of your storm the presence of the enemy
[1:02:23] is only proof that the presence of god
[1:02:25] is near you
[1:02:29] take that devil
[1:02:31] the presence of my current struggle and
[1:02:34] trouble and all of the calamity and i
[1:02:36] can't figure it out i'm throwing up my
[1:02:38] hands the presence of that is proof that
[1:02:41] god is right on the scene and right on
[1:02:43] time
[1:02:45] we get to this place to where we can't
[1:02:47] find him job said i can't figure it out
[1:02:51] i can't how could how could my how could
[1:02:54] i lose everything and god be with me how
[1:02:56] can i have loss of family and god's with
[1:02:59] me how could i have health issues and
[1:03:01] god's with me and if i don't see him i
[1:03:04] can't see him i looked on the right how
[1:03:06] could how could it be let me just say
[1:03:08] this
[1:03:09] that's this is why this is why the bible
[1:03:11] says that in order to serve the lord
[1:03:14] you've got to walk by faith
[1:03:17] and not by sight
[1:03:21] you've got to walk by faith not by what
[1:03:23] you feel
[1:03:26] you've got to walk by faith and not by
[1:03:28] what you see
[1:03:29] because sometimes what you see can
[1:03:30] become discouraging
[1:03:35] and you get to the place to where
[1:03:37] but let me just say this god does some
[1:03:39] of his greatest work in your life
[1:03:43] when you're in the midst of trouble and
[1:03:44] struggle and you you're like job you
[1:03:46] can't see him you can't feel him you
[1:03:48] can't touch him you can't hear him
[1:03:51] but yet something beyond you
[1:03:53] reaches out and says but lord
[1:03:56] i still believe but lord
[1:03:59] i'm still gonna worship you
[1:04:01] but lord i'm still gonna press on
[1:04:04] but lord i'm still gonna serve you
[1:04:07] but lord i'm still gonna have faith i
[1:04:09] can't see can't hear can't feel can't
[1:04:11] touch
[1:04:14] because worship from the soul
[1:04:16] and the times when you don't feel it is
[1:04:20] some of the most
[1:04:21] acceptable worship to the lord
[1:04:26] they got to this place to where they
[1:04:28] couldn't see it
[1:04:30] and they they they couldn't hear it it's
[1:04:32] amazing
[1:04:33] because david says here he says let me
[1:04:36] let me just move past this so we're
[1:04:38] never going to get to our thoughts let
[1:04:39] me just go on
[1:04:41] he says blessed is the man this is
[1:04:42] jeremiah blessed is the man that
[1:04:45] trusteth in the lord
[1:04:47] and whose hope
[1:04:50] is the lord
[1:04:54] cursed be the man who trusteth in the
[1:04:55] arm of flesh and man and maketh flesh
[1:04:57] his arm but blessed is the man
[1:05:01] remember what it says it said cursed is
[1:05:03] the man and he gets to a place who began
[1:05:05] who who he he he almost comes to a place
[1:05:08] to where he's drowning
[1:05:10] and shallow water and let me just say
[1:05:12] this to you my brother my sister
[1:05:14] sometimes
[1:05:15] when you're in great calamity don't
[1:05:16] trust your senses
[1:05:18] you can't trust your feelings
[1:05:21] you can't even you can't you can't trust
[1:05:23] it's it's he says it's like a uh
[1:05:26] psychiatrist even has said that a person
[1:05:28] who gets to that place it's like a pilot
[1:05:31] flying uh an airplane
[1:05:34] uh but he but he's he can't look at his
[1:05:37] his gauges
[1:05:40] and he says because his gage has he's
[1:05:42] completely lost trust in everything
[1:05:44] around him he's lost trust in people
[1:05:47] he's lost trust in family he's lost
[1:05:50] trust in friends because that pressure
[1:05:52] gets you to a place to where you can't
[1:05:54] curse and be the man that trusteth in
[1:05:57] the flesh
[1:05:59] but david said blessed is the man who
[1:06:02] trusteth in the lord for he shall be as
[1:06:05] a tree planted by the waters
[1:06:09] that spreadeth out her roots by the
[1:06:11] river do you say lord that's what i want
[1:06:14] i want to be that tree planted by the
[1:06:16] rivers of water and shall not see
[1:06:19] when the heat cometh but her leaf shall
[1:06:21] be green and shall not be careful in the
[1:06:24] year of drought neither shall cease from
[1:06:26] yielding
[1:06:28] fruit the first person jeremiah speaks
[1:06:30] of doesn't wait for the lord to move
[1:06:35] he takes matters into his own hands
[1:06:37] makes his own plans
[1:06:40] turns to people
[1:06:42] he thinks that our people of
[1:06:44] influence he takes shortcuts he's
[1:06:47] trusted in the arm of flesh
[1:06:49] scheming planning manipulating
[1:06:55] you know this is exactly us descriptive
[1:06:58] perfectly
[1:07:00] sometimes in our life
[1:07:03] when we try to figure it out we try to
[1:07:05] get ourself out of a mess
[1:07:08] and we try to solve the problem
[1:07:12] and scripture says the bible says a
[1:07:15] spiritual dryness
[1:07:17] sets in
[1:07:18] he shall be like the heath verse six
[1:07:21] you know what that is that's like a
[1:07:22] shrub
[1:07:24] it's a shrub in the desert
[1:07:26] he looks barely alive with no fruit no
[1:07:30] wellspring of life
[1:07:31] he's on the brink of passing away he he
[1:07:35] shall same verse there in verse six he
[1:07:37] shall not see when good cometh
[1:07:41] he never partakes in the joy this is
[1:07:43] what it is he never partakes in the joy
[1:07:47] uh being being delivered by god's hand
[1:07:51] because he's he wants to be delivered by
[1:07:53] his own hand
[1:07:57] and the bible says he shall see he shall
[1:08:00] not see when good
[1:08:02] cometh
[1:08:03] he's in perched
[1:08:04] places that's isolated places he withers
[1:08:09] but but now i want you to look here look
[1:08:11] at the man who trusts
[1:08:13] in the lord
[1:08:15] and whose hope in verse 7
[1:08:17] is the lord
[1:08:19] he's planted
[1:08:22] he has roots
[1:08:25] he has stability
[1:08:27] he has living water
[1:08:29] he's spreading out
[1:08:32] he's fruitful and green and fresh
[1:08:36] with life
[1:08:40] the bible says he shall not be careful
[1:08:43] that means fearful
[1:08:45] he shall not be fearful in the year of
[1:08:48] drought when things get hot
[1:08:51] when things get scorching
[1:08:53] when the weather when the storms come he
[1:08:55] won't be afraid
[1:08:57] oh that's why romans chapter 8 verse 37
[1:09:01] the apostle paul begins to say nay in
[1:09:04] all these things
[1:09:06] what are these things and all of the
[1:09:08] troubles
[1:09:10] and all of the struggles and all of the
[1:09:12] hard times
[1:09:13] we are more than conquerors through him
[1:09:16] that loved us
[1:09:20] trials can come and they can be very
[1:09:22] very different and some and and you
[1:09:25] could almost
[1:09:26] categorize a trial
[1:09:29] trial could be like a crisis sometimes
[1:09:32] it could be like a crisis something
[1:09:34] suddenly that you've came into
[1:09:36] then there's trials that are more steady
[1:09:38] almost like a relentless
[1:09:41] constant pressure that just wear away at
[1:09:44] our resistance and wear us down and wear
[1:09:47] us down and wear us down
[1:09:50] and we've all got them
[1:09:52] and we we say brother matt what do we do
[1:09:55] and that in that time we should pray
[1:09:58] more we should trust the lord more but
[1:10:00] for some reason in our greatest calamity
[1:10:03] somehow that's the time when we find
[1:10:05] ourselves sometimes the hardest time to
[1:10:08] pray the hardest time to have faith the
[1:10:11] hardest time to consult the lord we
[1:10:13] consult everything else around us except
[1:10:17] the only thing that has the answer
[1:10:20] can you say amen this morning
[1:10:24] you say i struggle why why don't i pray
[1:10:28] for the
[1:10:29] why don't i pray the greatest weapon the
[1:10:31] prophet of god said that god that god
[1:10:33] ever gave to man
[1:10:35] and you can type that in and there's
[1:10:37] there's 11 or 12 different weapons
[1:10:39] brother adam gives but he comes almost
[1:10:41] always to the same thing the greatest
[1:10:44] weapon god ever gave man was prayer
[1:10:51] if it's my greatest weapon
[1:10:54] then why when i'm in my greatest battle
[1:10:57] don't i find myself using
[1:10:59] my greatest weapon
[1:11:02] the answer is very
[1:11:04] simple it's not complicated it's not
[1:11:06] science
[1:11:07] it's not it's not some complicated
[1:11:10] answer i'm going to give it to you very
[1:11:12] simple it's because we believe
[1:11:14] too much in ourselves
[1:11:18] you know what it's called it's called
[1:11:19] pride
[1:11:23] not enough humility
[1:11:25] we relied too much on i'm gonna fix it
[1:11:28] i'm gonna fix it for myself
[1:11:33] the sailors had no answer
[1:11:35] the sailors had no
[1:11:37] answer
[1:11:38] you know why here's why give me that
[1:11:40] first slide brother jeremy to my
[1:11:42] powerpoint if you could i'm going to
[1:11:44] give you a ho i'm not sure i hope they
[1:11:45] could see this well i've got some slides
[1:11:48] this is why he says i am the vine
[1:11:53] you are the branches
[1:11:56] he that abideth in me and i in him the
[1:12:00] same bringeth forth much fruit here's
[1:12:03] the simple
[1:12:04] reality of your life and every problem
[1:12:07] that you face
[1:12:09] for
[1:12:09] without me
[1:12:12] you can
[1:12:14] do
[1:12:15] nothing
[1:12:19] without me simple truth but it's in bold
[1:12:22] i wish it was in highlights i wish it
[1:12:24] was in neon lights i wish i could hold
[1:12:27] it before my face i wish i could remind
[1:12:29] you
[1:12:30] today and have a loud trumpet and remind
[1:12:33] you children of god without hume you can
[1:12:36] do nothing
[1:12:39] i don't care how great you think you are
[1:12:41] how smart you think you are how eloquent
[1:12:44] you think you are charismatic without
[1:12:46] him you're nothing and you can do
[1:12:49] nothing about it
[1:12:51] quit trying to figure the problem out
[1:12:57] without me you may toil you may beg you
[1:13:00] may plead
[1:13:02] jesus said but without me you can do
[1:13:05] nothing
[1:13:07] unless you abide in me and i in you
[1:13:10] this is amazing because it was in this
[1:13:12] this nothingness
[1:13:14] that the bible starts with when there
[1:13:16] was just darkness and blackness and void
[1:13:19] and there was nothing but then the
[1:13:21] creator's voice
[1:13:23] spoke
[1:13:24] to the void
[1:13:26] and to the darkness
[1:13:27] he spoke
[1:13:29] to the deep he spoke to the darkness it
[1:13:33] was nothing but then he speaks but he
[1:13:36] spoke and everything changed when he
[1:13:38] spoke
[1:13:40] light was replaced darkness was replaced
[1:13:42] with light he said brother matt what
[1:13:44] does that mean that means that god you
[1:13:46] need to ask god and say lord will you
[1:13:48] speak i've got nothing i've realized i'm
[1:13:50] nothing i have nothingness there's a
[1:13:52] void over my life so will you speak lord
[1:13:56] and if you'll speak if the created voice
[1:13:59] will speak to my darkness i say lord
[1:14:02] this morning speak to my darkness speak
[1:14:04] to my void lord would you say to my
[1:14:07] trial and my storm let there be light
[1:14:13] notice what brother branham says here
[1:14:15] satan could not take them
[1:14:18] i hope you may not be able to read this
[1:14:19] very well satan could not take them he
[1:14:22] could not drown noah in the flood until
[1:14:24] the purpose of god had been finished he
[1:14:26] couldn't drowned you he can't drown you
[1:14:30] until god's finished with you
[1:14:34] he says
[1:14:36] he couldn't burn up the hebrew children
[1:14:38] until the purpose of god had been
[1:14:41] finished he could not kill job
[1:14:44] with his boils and troubles
[1:14:47] until the purpose of god had been
[1:14:50] finished neither could the lions eat
[1:14:52] daniel until god's purpose had been
[1:14:55] finished
[1:14:56] neither could death and old age take
[1:14:58] abraham until the purpose of god had
[1:15:02] been finished and neither can it take
[1:15:05] you or can it take me
[1:15:08] how many can raise your hand and say
[1:15:10] i'll put my name there until the purpose
[1:15:13] of god has been finished put your faith
[1:15:17] and no matter what you're facing and it
[1:15:19] looks like you're drowning and your
[1:15:21] house is on fire and you're not going to
[1:15:23] make it until god is finished satan
[1:15:26] can't take me he can't touch me he can't
[1:15:28] have me because i'm his
[1:15:31] and his purpose and his plan i'm part of
[1:15:34] and so until god has accomplished what
[1:15:37] he's seen in me
[1:15:41] the devil can't have me
[1:15:43] he can't have my children he can't have
[1:15:45] my home he can't have my mind i give him
[1:15:48] no place i i cast him out i can't have
[1:15:52] him he can't whisper he can't speak he
[1:15:54] can't have me because i'm the lords can
[1:15:56] you say amen this morning
[1:15:58] until he has accomplished
[1:16:00] his purpose so that means he's got a
[1:16:02] purpose
[1:16:03] in that storm
[1:16:05] psalms 107 you don't have to turn but
[1:16:08] remember the scripture that we read he
[1:16:10] maketh the stormy winds
[1:16:14] hello
[1:16:16] he maketh the stormy winds who crashed
[1:16:22] paul's boat
[1:16:27] where did the tempest come from
[1:16:31] who's the one who decided that both that
[1:16:34] you've depended upon and that boat that
[1:16:36] you've put so much trust in
[1:16:39] i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna destroy it
[1:16:41] today you know who did that god
[1:16:46] because the lord had a purpose
[1:16:49] the lord had a purpose in it all you
[1:16:51] know what would have happened how they
[1:16:52] tried to save themselves and try to hold
[1:16:54] on to the boat and try to just keep
[1:16:56] making the boat work and keep trying
[1:16:58] we've got to save it sometimes god
[1:17:00] intentionally removes something from
[1:17:02] your life because he doesn't want you to
[1:17:04] have it anymore
[1:17:06] and we can become so busy trying to hold
[1:17:09] on to what god's trying to get us to
[1:17:11] child let go of it
[1:17:15] i took it from you
[1:17:18] because i knew it was best for you
[1:17:21] and anything that god takes from you god
[1:17:25] knew
[1:17:27] god anything god removes from your life
[1:17:30] let me just say this if god intended for
[1:17:33] you to have it it would still be in your
[1:17:35] life
[1:17:39] he says until he's accomplished the
[1:17:42] purpose so god had a purpose
[1:17:44] he has a purpose in causing the stormy
[1:17:47] wind to raise and i just want to stop
[1:17:50] and i just want to say something the
[1:17:52] lord spoke to me
[1:17:54] and i'm going to say it to you
[1:17:56] and i believe maybe you'll grab on if
[1:17:58] you could grab on by faith let me just
[1:18:01] say this to you as the lord gave it to
[1:18:02] me
[1:18:03] that storm those waves that trial that
[1:18:06] struggle
[1:18:08] that trial that you're in
[1:18:10] until god has accomplished his purpose
[1:18:16] that storm isn't going anywhere
[1:18:21] you can't pray it away
[1:18:26] you could try
[1:18:27] you could want you could want sunshine
[1:18:29] but when god has you in that
[1:18:32] for a reason until he's accomplished his
[1:18:35] purpose in you
[1:18:38] the storm will continue to rage
[1:18:40] until god is finished with the purpose
[1:18:44] of the wave and the flood the waters
[1:18:47] will still rise but just remember this
[1:18:50] he
[1:18:51] has
[1:18:52] a reason
[1:18:55] can you say amen
[1:18:56] he has
[1:18:58] a purpose
[1:19:01] why does god
[1:19:03] that's the message i know brother random
[1:19:05] speaking on job and why does god let
[1:19:08] troubles come
[1:19:10] god harnesses trouble
[1:19:13] puts bits in its mouth
[1:19:15] and makes it obey him
[1:19:18] and those
[1:19:19] troubles bring us into a closer
[1:19:23] fellowship
[1:19:26] with god
[1:19:29] i know this is simple
[1:19:31] i know it's simple i know it's
[1:19:32] elementary but it's just what the lord
[1:19:34] told me to preach
[1:19:37] why does god let trouble come
[1:19:39] god harnesses it puts bits in its mouth
[1:19:42] makes it obey him
[1:19:44] and those
[1:19:46] troubles
[1:19:48] bring us into a closer
[1:19:52] fellowship
[1:19:54] with god
[1:19:56] think it not strange
[1:19:59] when trials
[1:20:01] no that's not what the bible says
[1:20:04] think it not strange when fiery trials
[1:20:11] fiery trials
[1:20:13] and troubles come
[1:20:15] think it not strange as these men did
[1:20:19] when they were at their wits in
[1:20:20] completely where they had no hope
[1:20:24] they they had lost all ability
[1:20:27] they had lost all ability
[1:20:31] to control the ship
[1:20:33] and and they were being hit from all
[1:20:36] sides
[1:20:37] but let me say this god's not surprised
[1:20:40] by your ordeal god's not surprised by
[1:20:44] your struggle it's happening because he
[1:20:47] wants to produce something in your life
[1:20:50] and oftentimes it's the answer to a
[1:20:52] prayer when you pray and you say lord i
[1:20:55] want to be closer how many have prayed
[1:20:57] that prayer before
[1:20:59] i want to be more like jesus has anybody
[1:21:01] any christians here raise your hand you
[1:21:03] ever prayed that and said lord i want to
[1:21:05] be more like you i prayed that prayer
[1:21:06] prayed it this morning say lord i want
[1:21:08] to be i want to be more i want to make
[1:21:10] sure lord that i'm living like you i
[1:21:12] want to be more like god i want to be
[1:21:14] how many's ever prayed this lord i want
[1:21:16] to be drawn closer to you
[1:21:20] and so god says okay good i'm going to
[1:21:23] answer that prayer i'm going to draw you
[1:21:26] closer to me but it's going to come
[1:21:27] through struggle and through battle and
[1:21:30] through trial and through testing and
[1:21:33] through storms
[1:21:36] and then we say what's happening in my
[1:21:38] life god says well didn't you pray
[1:21:43] and you prayed didn't well yes lord yes
[1:21:45] i i did pray w what did you pray well i
[1:21:48] prayed to be more like you
[1:21:51] uh-huh
[1:21:53] i prayed to be drawn closer to you right
[1:21:56] are you getting it
[1:21:58] no lord i don't understand i prayed that
[1:22:00] and yet i i prayed for more of you i
[1:22:03] prayed for less of me and now i'll find
[1:22:05] myself in the midst of a storm and the
[1:22:07] more of a struggle but it not strange
[1:22:10] when fiery trials are to try you
[1:22:15] knowing that that trial of your faith is
[1:22:17] more precious than gold
[1:22:21] god says i'm trying to produce something
[1:22:24] in your heart i want to reveal myself to
[1:22:27] you and you feel like it's the worst
[1:22:29] time and the worst storm and it may be
[1:22:32] financial it may be business it may be
[1:22:34] family it may be tragedy no matter what
[1:22:36] it is
[1:22:37] you you you're the restlessness that you
[1:22:40] feel and and and as david said and
[1:22:42] notice what he says here he says uh
[1:22:44] these men begin to pray and notice no
[1:22:47] doubt they could say lord how long will
[1:22:49] i have to go through this how how much
[1:22:51] more am i going to endure
[1:22:53] when will god bring us to the desired
[1:22:56] other side
[1:23:00] the bible says the sailors come to their
[1:23:02] wit's end
[1:23:03] you know that is important one of the
[1:23:06] first
[1:23:07] steps
[1:23:08] needed before god can deliver you out of
[1:23:12] your marry clay is that you have to give
[1:23:15] up
[1:23:16] on yourself
[1:23:19] until god breaks you of your will he
[1:23:22] can't help you
[1:23:26] they came to inability
[1:23:28] all help we can't save ourselves nobody
[1:23:31] in this earth in this world in the stars
[1:23:34] in in this in space under the earth
[1:23:38] nobody no person no human nobody can get
[1:23:42] us out of this so what did they do they
[1:23:44] cried
[1:23:46] to the lord
[1:23:48] i believe the lord hears you when you
[1:23:50] cry
[1:23:53] you know god can't answer a prayer that
[1:23:55] you've never prayed
[1:23:58] and all the while we're asking lord can
[1:24:00] you answer that you've never even asked
[1:24:02] him
[1:24:05] he can't hear a cry
[1:24:08] for he can't answer your cry of help if
[1:24:10] you're not crying
[1:24:11] for help
[1:24:13] then they cry unto the lord
[1:24:16] in their trouble
[1:24:18] and he bringeth them out of their
[1:24:21] distress
[1:24:22] he i love this
[1:24:24] he maketh the storm
[1:24:31] come
[1:24:33] only only he can do that
[1:24:36] only god can speak
[1:24:38] to a storm only jesus
[1:24:41] can speak to a storm
[1:24:44] and say
[1:24:45] peace
[1:24:48] be still
[1:24:50] and then there's a
[1:24:57] he may get the storm
[1:24:59] calm
[1:25:01] so that the waves thereof
[1:25:03] are still
[1:25:06] then are they glad
[1:25:08] because they be quiet
[1:25:11] so he bringeth
[1:25:13] them
[1:25:14] unto
[1:25:16] their desired
[1:25:18] haven

[1:26:30] let me just remind you your battle won't
[1:26:34] stop your struggle won't cease your
[1:26:38] trials will continue to come and you'll
[1:26:41] get out of this one only to go into
[1:26:43] another one you might make it and you're
[1:26:45] saying oh if i could ever get out of
[1:26:46] this if i could ever get killed if i
[1:26:48] could ever get out of this mess if i
[1:26:50] could ever get over this hump let me
[1:26:51] tell you as a child of god what's on the
[1:26:54] other side of that trial is another
[1:26:56] trial and what's on the other side of
[1:26:58] that struggle that you're so perplexed
[1:27:01] about and so asking god to deliver you
[1:27:03] let me just tell you what's waiting for
[1:27:05] you on the other side another trial and
[1:27:07] another struggle and another valley and
[1:27:10] another trouble but let me just remind
[1:27:12] you my dear brother and my sister it's
[1:27:14] for your perfection it's for your
[1:27:16] character it's so that you can get out
[1:27:18] of here because one day i'll come out of
[1:27:21] my last trial and this body will change
[1:27:24] and the elements will change and it'll
[1:27:26] be my last struggle i go through is to
[1:27:28] change this
[1:27:31] mortal flesh
[1:27:36] what are you doing now brother matt
[1:27:37] trials are coming and what are they
[1:27:38] doing they're molding me and shaping me
[1:27:41] and molding me and shaping me and that's
[1:27:43] what i'm praying for and that's what i'm
[1:27:45] asking and that's what i'm desiring i
[1:27:47] want you to shape me and mold me until
[1:27:50] eventually god decides to change you at
[1:27:52] the atomic level and it changes you from
[1:27:55] old to young
[1:27:57] and from decaying to perfect and from
[1:28:00] corruption
[1:28:01] to incorruption
[1:28:05] he said brother man oh that's got to be
[1:28:07] we you know friends we put that off in
[1:28:09] our mind as oh some great big thing way
[1:28:11] out yonder way off in the distance god
[1:28:13] somewhere perfect faith and perfect
[1:28:15] unity and everybody will be in harmony
[1:28:17] and let me tell you that's what's
[1:28:18] happening right now through your trials
[1:28:21] and through your test the body change
[1:28:23] will not be some massive
[1:28:25] transportation from your walk with god
[1:28:28] but the bible says that enoch walked
[1:28:30] with god he was one day one day the next
[1:28:33] day the next day and then he was changed
[1:28:37] and your body change will not be some
[1:28:39] great transportation it'll just be
[1:28:41] another day in the life of a believer
[1:28:43] and the life of trials and tribulations
[1:28:46] and storms and tests but one day the sun
[1:28:49] will wake up the sun will shine and
[1:28:51] it'll be my last test it'll be your last
[1:28:54] trial it'll be your last struggle and i
[1:28:57] say lord hasten the day o god let me
[1:29:00] serve you faithfully today
[1:29:03] so that i can be found faithful tomorrow
[1:29:08] he maketh the storm
[1:29:11] a calm
[1:29:19] and storms are raging you could be
[1:29:21] missing
[1:29:22] let me just say this to you today
[1:29:24] and i'm just going to close this phil
[1:29:26] just to stop right there we've been long
[1:29:28] enough brother matthew if you just come
[1:29:32] storms will come
[1:29:35] trials will
[1:29:36] come but god has the ability only god
[1:29:42] has the ability
[1:29:44] as he did for those sailors
[1:29:46] let's look at it psalms 107 one more
[1:29:48] time if we could
[1:29:51] i want you just to put that up on the
[1:29:52] screen
[1:29:57] they that go down let's just begin
[1:29:59] reading that verse 20
[1:30:01] 5
[1:30:02] psalms 107.
[1:30:04] for he commandeth and raiseth the stormy
[1:30:08] wind
[1:30:09] which lifteth up the waves thereof they
[1:30:11] mount up to the heaven they go down
[1:30:14] again to the depths their soul is melted
[1:30:16] because of trouble they reel to and fro
[1:30:19] and stack her like a drunken man and are
[1:30:21] at their wit's end and maybe you're at
[1:30:24] your wit's end
[1:30:26] then here's what you do
[1:30:28] they cry
[1:30:29] unto the lord
[1:30:31] in their trouble
[1:30:36] they cry into the lord
[1:30:38] in their trouble
[1:30:40] and he
[1:30:41] bringeth them
[1:30:43] out of their distress
[1:30:45] he maketh the storm a calm
[1:30:49] so that the waves therefore
[1:30:52] are still
[1:30:54] maybe today you
[1:30:56] in your life you just want to say lord
[1:30:58] i've reached my wit's end
[1:31:01] i've reached my end of myself
[1:31:03] could you bear your heads lower with me
[1:31:05] raise your hands to the lord and say
[1:31:06] that lord
[1:31:08] i've reached the end of myself
[1:31:12] i've reached it lord i've reached wit's
[1:31:14] end and now i'm crying unto the lord
[1:31:18] out of my trouble
[1:31:20] he maketh the storm a calm
[1:31:23] then are they glad
[1:31:26] because they be quiet
[1:31:28] so he bringeth them
[1:31:30] unto their desired haven
[1:31:36] i wonder if you could do that today
[1:31:39] just raise a hand to the lord and say
[1:31:40] lord
[1:31:41] would you speak
[1:31:43] to my storm
[1:31:46] could you cause a calm
[1:31:51] could you cause a peace and a calm
[1:31:54] my heart is jumping leaping and
[1:31:56] out of rhythm
[1:31:58] and i'm i just need you to speak lord
[1:32:02] believe that you can do it
[1:32:04] you've spoken your word lord jesus i see
