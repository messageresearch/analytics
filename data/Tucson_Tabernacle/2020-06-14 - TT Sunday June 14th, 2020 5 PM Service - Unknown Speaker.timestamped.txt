[39:15] just want to thank him and show our love
[39:17] back to him we have a couple of requests
[39:21] to bring your attention this morning mr.
[39:26] Yarborough had written in a very
[39:27] requested the name one there was hard to
[39:31] read but I recognize him for the man and
[39:34] it was sister Lucy bail her the ask
[39:37] prayer request for cancer no she was
[39:40] part of the Congregation for some time
[39:42] for the Daniel Ramirez sister and I
[39:45] believe is she back in California with
[39:47] with her family there so remember sister
[39:50] though she and her time today also
[39:52] brother Tony Ramirez called William it
[39:56] had a minor surgery and had got infected
[39:58] and had to go in today to have that
[40:00] taken care of somebody called me this
[40:02] afternoon they had been able to take
[40:04] care of infection and he said that there
[40:08] was more troublesome filling all the
[40:09] paperwork out and everything than it was
[40:11] them taking care of it he was grateful
[40:13] that it didn't get worsen him him an
[40:17] older brother as him his friend and his
[40:18] wife's name is Liz
[40:21] she she has a sister who has a son named
[40:26] Ray and ray son and why for the three of
[40:30] them have COBIT and they found race on
[40:34] about 25 years old
[40:36] unresponsive today and they raced him
[40:39] off to the hospital and he's on a
[40:40] ventilator but hidden up in responding
[40:43] and a couple of days ago her half-sister
[40:47] older sister's son
[40:50] nobody could contact him they went to
[40:52] look for him in his house he found him
[40:54] dead in his house they don't know for
[40:56] sure Fisk of it so my sister-in-law was
[40:58] quite shocked up today and that they
[41:01] would have to go through something like
[41:02] this older brother and his wife so I
[41:05] told him we would bring that to your
[41:07] attention to pray so let's stand him you
[41:11] have a need that's good to see sister
[41:14] Holly here after her request concerning
[41:16] her co-worker and an covet that God
[41:19] keeps his children he said that token
[41:22] would be applied and he would keep us so
[41:25] let's just believe that we asked Lord
[41:27] Jesus you've heard the requests and
[41:30] sometimes we actually know the folks and
[41:32] sometimes are just names but either way
[41:35] you know them Lord you're the author of
[41:39] life you're the giver of life Lord we
[41:42] pray for her for brother Tony for
[41:44] complete complete restoration of his
[41:46] body or from this infection for sister
[41:50] Lucy there with her son in California
[41:52] fighting cancer we think about something
[41:56] that brother Branham who said cancer is
[41:59] not bad if you don't fear
[42:01] take the fear out of our sisters heart
[42:05] right now those around her that might be
[42:07] full of fear and let the peace of God
[42:10] just settle over that Lord and may they
[42:12] trust in you and confide in you
[42:15] Saint no rules with fear Lord but you
[42:17] rule with peace and love Lord
[42:19] my sister-in-law Lord Eze and Fred in
[42:22] the family Lord and one loss already and
[42:25] three in the hospital Lord they're there
[42:28] they're good folks Lord they're friends
[42:29] they're they're a part of our family
[42:31] name they may not believe the same way
[42:33] we believe but your Jesus Christ the
[42:35] same yesterday today and forever so Lord
[42:37] we extend Lord our faith out towards
[42:40] that Lord in every hand that was raised
[42:42] Lord we believe in Lord together and ask
[42:46] it in Jesus Christ's name and can we
[42:49] sing that Lord I believe is a confession

[43:03] [Music]
[43:18] I can testimony to go
[43:22] [Music]
[43:26] at all things are awesome
[43:31] [Music]
[43:38] praise the Lord God bless you amen
[43:41] tonight if you have your Bible let's go
[43:43] straight to Ecclesiastes amen chapter 11
[43:46] Ecclesiastes chapter 11
[43:48] amen I appreciate all that music amen
[43:52] and worship and then Ecclesiastes
[43:54] chapter 11 we had a PowerPoint we said
[43:58] if we get it good if not hey don't okay
[44:00] got the thumbs up no worries at all no
[44:03] we were a man asked the thing about
[44:05] technology it's just there to frustrate
[44:07] you appreciate it when it works amen but
[44:10] I sure appreciate the brothers amen
[44:12] working on that so so hard this morning
[44:15] and I trust that something was said this
[44:17] morning that you were encouraged by Amen
[44:20] that you were blessed by so we just have
[44:22] something more we'd like to continue
[44:24] amen tonight and I'm going to title this
[44:27] a little differently than we did this
[44:28] morning I like to speak on in touch with
[44:33] an eternal reality in touch with an
[44:36] eternal reality we're gonna read from
[44:40] Ecclesiastes 11 we also want to turn to
[44:44] Hebrews chapter 11 first we'll catch
[44:47] Ecclesiastes and then we'll have you be
[44:49] seated please he asked these eleven
[44:51] verse 7 truly the light is sweet and a
[44:56] pleasant thing it is for the eyes to
[44:59] behold the Sun but if a man live many
[45:02] years and rejoice in them all yet let
[45:06] him remember the days of darkness for
[45:09] they shall be many all that cometh is
[45:12] vanity now you remember where we were in
[45:16] chapter 3 this morning and a Solomon
[45:19] after he had gotten everything in life
[45:21] and had prospered and had all of the the
[45:26] you know prosperity he can gain he says
[45:29] after everything no one's going to
[45:30] remember it it's all vanity and he
[45:33] continues this in Chapter 11 further and
[45:36] he says read it again in verse 8 but if
[45:39] a man lived many years and rejoicing
[45:41] them all yet let him remember the days
[45:43] of darkness for they shall be many
[45:45] all that cometh is vanity rejoice Oh
[45:48] young man in thy youth I'm young so I'm
[45:52] gonna rejoice and let thy heart cheer
[45:55] thee in the days of thy youth now watch
[45:58] right here what he says he says and
[46:01] rejoice in the days of thy let thy heart
[46:02] cheer thee in the days of thy youth and
[46:04] walked in the ways of thine heart and in
[46:08] the sight of thine eyes but know thou
[46:11] that for all these things God will bring
[46:14] thee into judgment now I want you to
[46:18] just to hold there and I'm going to read
[46:19] you from the Tyndale house translation
[46:22] of this just bringing a little bit more
[46:24] modern English into it it doesn't change
[46:26] this the context or the thought at all
[46:28] I'm gonna read the same exact verses it
[46:31] says it's a wonderful thing to be alive
[46:34] if a person lives to be very old
[46:37] let him rejoice in every day of life but
[46:40] let him also remember that eternity is
[46:43] far longer and that everything down here
[46:46] is futile in comparison young man it's
[46:51] wonderful to be young enjoy every minute
[46:54] of it do all you want to take in
[46:56] everything but realize that you must
[46:59] give an account to God for everything
[47:02] you do hebrews chapter 11 does turn
[47:06] there quickly what is read 1 very
[47:08] familiar verse Hebrews 11 and verse 1
[47:12] Hebrews 11 and verse 1
[47:20] now faith notice I know you've read this
[47:24] many times I'm showing you you know just
[47:27] reading the Bible but I want to just
[47:29] bring this amen and from just a just to
[47:32] shed some light on this verse here he
[47:34] says now faith is is going to define
[47:37] what faith is faith is the substance of
[47:42] things hoped for the evidence of things
[47:48] not seen
[47:50] read it again now faith is the substance
[47:52] of things hoped for the evidence of
[47:56] things not seen let's just bow our heads
[47:58] here just for a moment Lord Jesus or
[48:00] where the Lord God of your presence Lord
[48:04] your concern for us as your children
[48:06] Lord as your family Lord were also very
[48:10] keenly aware Lord of our inability to
[48:13] help ourself Lord Isaiah said it's not
[48:17] even inside of a man to find his own
[48:20] path Lord and your prophet preached a
[48:23] message called the guide Lord and you
[48:26] brought him to such a place to where he
[48:28] just gave up and threw up his hands and
[48:30] Lord and and I never Lord the words that
[48:34] he spoke Lord as he as it begins to
[48:36] testify that moment of anxiety and fear
[48:39] Lord lost out there in the snow and the
[48:42] dark on that mountain Lord but when he
[48:44] grabbed ahold of that line there was
[48:45] such an assurance Lord and were grateful
[48:49] today Lord that we grabbed a hold of
[48:51] that line from Calvary Lord it's an
[48:53] anchor for our soul Lord it's a surety
[48:56] it's a guarantee we have Lord it's a
[49:00] certainty that we possess and in such an
[49:03] uncertain world we pray God that you
[49:05] would come and take these words Lord
[49:07] anoint your words already anointed we
[49:09] believe that but may you anoint us Lord
[49:11] as a speaker Lord I raised my hands with
[49:14] every individual here and ask well God
[49:16] would you come and anoint us to receive
[49:18] Lord as this is a form of worship Lord
[49:21] as we worship you tonight may you just
[49:24] meet it every singing every single need
[49:26] Lord speak to every single heart thus
[49:28] our visitors Lord who are visiting here
[49:30] with us Lord and though
[49:32] lord I pray that her maybe listening by
[49:34] Lord livestream or the phone hookup God
[49:37] may you just be near us all near us Lord
[49:40] one and all we ask have your way we ask
[49:43] above all lord in jesus christ's name
[49:46] amen you can be seated
[49:48] I have a lot just again amen here on my
[49:51] plates I'm just gonna get straight to it
[49:53] and this is subject of faith that has
[49:56] been spoken on many times and when you
[50:00] come to this subject the Bible says that
[50:03] faith is the evidence or the substance
[50:07] of things hoped for it's the evidence of
[50:10] things not seen I had a conversation
[50:13] with a man much older than myself just a
[50:16] few years ago now maybe two years ago
[50:18] had a very lengthy conversation with him
[50:22] ran into him had known him you know from
[50:25] the days I was maybe 10 or 11 years old
[50:27] and he went to our church for many years
[50:30] and I had ran into him years after he
[50:33] left the church and and had a
[50:35] conversation with that individual and I
[50:38] was just so taken back by some of the
[50:41] things that were said by as I said a
[50:44] person much older than me a man who
[50:46] maybe you would say is in the twilight
[50:48] of his life you know the setting of the
[50:51] Sun older in years much older you know I
[50:55] would be you know double my age and more
[50:59] than double my age and this person just
[51:02] began to tell me as we begin to speak at
[51:06] this restaurant he began to express to
[51:09] me how that he had came to a spot in his
[51:12] life where he had lost all faith and he
[51:15] had lost all of his security it lost all
[51:20] of his surety his stability and and he
[51:23] had left the church left the message and
[51:26] and he was just telling me and he was
[51:28] currently in this state wasn't speaking
[51:30] of it as if he had been restored but he
[51:32] just began telling me how he just it was
[51:34] very confident you know there and I was
[51:37] careful you know to say anything just
[51:40] out of respect for this individual
[51:43] and he just began to tell me how that he
[51:47] had lost all of his faith and that
[51:49] everything in his world had been shaken
[51:51] in his mind of what was real and what
[51:54] what he had always been taught and and
[51:57] and and was basically in a state of
[51:59] questioning everything in his life he
[52:02] was questioning what he believed he
[52:05] actually made a statement to me and he
[52:07] said my spirituality has changed
[52:10] completely and he said I'm still a
[52:12] spiritual person but the way I view
[52:14] everything in the world is different I'm
[52:17] a humanitarian person I'm a globalist I
[52:21] uh II said I believe in the help of
[52:23] humanity but I don't don't necessarily
[52:25] believe that there's a God he begin to
[52:28] go on to tell me that through things in
[52:31] his life he had been begin to question
[52:32] these things and I no doubt he was this
[52:35] person was just expressing his heart and
[52:37] expressing Hallie Phil Hallie Feldon he
[52:40] made a couple of couple statements to me
[52:42] that just began to spawn this line of
[52:45] thinking in my mind that I'm preaching
[52:47] here on tonight and touch with an
[52:50] eternal reality we have that catchphrase
[52:53] today to be in touch you know they use
[52:56] it today to be in touch means to be
[52:59] you're connected that your your your
[53:02] relevant you you have an understanding
[53:04] that you know it's you're grounded that
[53:07] you have a certain reality and they
[53:10] speak you know you just need to be say
[53:12] you need to be in touch with reality but
[53:15] we would like to speak here tonight on
[53:17] being in touch with an eternal reality
[53:19] because it is a reality eternity for the
[53:24] believer is a reality
[53:26] this person begin to speak you know just
[53:29] about how that they had they weren't
[53:32] sure of anything in their life and he
[53:33] morgue
[53:34] I believe no doubt I know it was just a
[53:37] divinely orchestrated moment maybe not
[53:39] for him so much but for myself it was
[53:42] just something the Lord used this to see
[53:45] to look into the eyes as I just stared
[53:48] into his eyes and just begin to try to
[53:51] you know in some ways come with some way
[53:55] of understanding
[53:56] how does a person who had claimed to
[53:59] believe in the Bible had claimed to go
[54:02] to church and be a Christian how do you
[54:04] get from point A to point B how did he
[54:07] arrive at this place in his mind and and
[54:11] and and I begin to ask this even before
[54:13] two weeks before this conversation
[54:16] just in prayer and just in my own self
[54:19] to think it was just riding in my
[54:20] vehicle and just talking to the Lord and
[54:22] the beginning the conversation is
[54:24] pondering a question as I was just
[54:26] beginning to be inspired for a sermon
[54:28] and I and I begin to ask the question
[54:31] you know what is what am i assured of
[54:34] what in my life is sure what can I know
[54:40] with certainty what parts of my life
[54:43] that are connected to me that that those
[54:46] things that have no question that
[54:49] there's a guarantee you know what things
[54:52] do we have in our life things that we
[54:55] whether it's a possession or a moment
[54:58] whether it's a memory here that you have
[55:01] in your possession what things that we
[55:03] possess today are sure that's a very
[55:08] important word what can we know is sure
[55:13] or secure you know we there's a famous
[55:18] song that I love so much called it's a
[55:22] it's an old hymn where your anchor hold
[55:24] and when you look at the lyrics of that
[55:27] song is really the inspiration the song
[55:30] says we have an anchor that is steadfast
[55:34] and Shore and it's and it's anchored
[55:37] behind the veil I'm going to read the
[55:39] lyrics to that song just here in a
[55:40] minute but I begin to ask myself this
[55:43] question what things are of a surety
[55:47] what things do we have that are a
[55:50] guarantee when I say a guarantee I mean
[55:53] it's got to meet the requirement that
[55:56] there is no uncertainty whatsoever about
[56:00] it you I'm sure could list many things
[56:02] here in your own mind tonight you may
[56:04] have a job and it's a good job and you
[56:07] think that job is secure
[56:08] you think it's a really good job but ask
[56:10] yourself just for a moment is that job
[56:13] really secure no matter how many years
[56:16] you've labored or put your heart into I
[56:19] don't care if you're a business owner
[56:20] tonight you think it's so secure I've
[56:23] got revolving contracts and I've got so
[56:25] much of a surety you know maybe you have
[56:27] a government job and and you thought oh
[56:29] it's so secure and I could never lose it
[56:31] well we're lately seeing that there's
[56:33] nothing secure about government even our
[56:36] own entire world economic system is
[56:39] riveting and shaking under the pressure
[56:42] of an economic collapse and you may say
[56:45] well you know a secure job but you know
[56:47] the government could fail tomorrow you
[56:49] could be out of work tomorrow you could
[56:51] have your business today and have an
[56:53] accident at work and get sued by
[56:55] somebody and you're out of business
[56:57] completely and you're out looking for a
[57:00] job owned on the Internet
[57:01] you don't know there when it comes to
[57:03] your career there's nothing sure no
[57:06] matter how much education you've put or
[57:08] how much effort you've put into it we
[57:11] can we can get a false sense of reality
[57:14] of what's really sure and what's
[57:17] securing us in our life many times
[57:19] people are secured by things that they
[57:21] don't even realize are a sense of
[57:24] security to them until they lose it and
[57:27] then suddenly their entire world
[57:30] unravels and comes apart because they
[57:32] realized they were anchored to the wrong
[57:35] thing and I'm just going to go for a
[57:37] moment here on inspiration many people
[57:40] leave the church many things happen and
[57:42] you take people who have so much you
[57:44] know are so anchored to maybe a man
[57:47] maybe a certain individual whether it's
[57:49] a pastor or a father or a loved one or
[57:52] family member and that there's such a
[57:54] anchor there's such a connection there's
[57:56] such a security that they feel but it's
[57:59] amazing when you watch a person if that
[58:02] if that person who they have so much
[58:04] security and happens to fall away or to
[58:07] lose their faith you would think that
[58:10] they would be secured but then they
[58:12] themselves become shaken by it it really
[58:15] calamity and distress
[58:17] sometimes reveal
[58:19] what we're really connected to hello
[58:23] somebody some people are just connected
[58:26] and they literally live off the life of
[58:28] the church the problem is is that's good
[58:31] as long as they like the church and as
[58:33] long as the church is good to them it's
[58:35] always amazing to me as I watch people
[58:38] who serve God for years in a church but
[58:40] watch that church do something very
[58:42] rightfully so wrong to them and they not
[58:45] only leave the church but they leave
[58:46] Christ and it goes to show you that
[58:50] there anchor was never in the word there
[58:53] anchor was in a man you watch people who
[58:57] leave the message and they that you
[58:59] realize that their anchor was on the
[59:01] deity of a man and they think that
[59:03] brother Branham was perfect and he made
[59:05] no mistakes he was a human being he had
[59:07] to make mistakes the only reason I can
[59:09] believe it's because I have a prophet
[59:12] who could be a man who could have
[59:14] mistakes have faults have failures tell
[59:16] a lie yeah I know only that's a hard
[59:21] subject for some people to say amen to
[59:23] but it's right auntie tell a lie tell
[59:27] him I'm not here lie the bill collector
[59:29] called brother Branham stepped out of
[59:30] the room said tell him I'm not even here
[59:32] it goes to pray for a little girl got
[59:34] Holy Spirit convicts him and says go
[59:36] make that right that doesn't shake me
[59:40] that gives me confidence just say that
[59:43] if God could use a man with mistakes if
[59:45] we had a prophet who was perfect in
[59:47] every way
[59:47] boy what chance do we have as believers
[59:49] of that message it's amazing what people
[59:57] are connected to and what their anchor
[1:00:02] really is established in started the
[1:00:05] word many times we find it's established
[1:00:08] in religion tradition how they were
[1:00:11] raised what Daddy believed what grandpa
[1:00:13] believed but you watch as some of those
[1:00:17] things start to get removed from their
[1:00:19] life and note this was the case of this
[1:00:22] gentleman I was speaking to and I just
[1:00:25] seen his faith that became
[1:00:27] so shipwrecked maybe you have here today
[1:00:31] you know you you have so much confidence
[1:00:33] and security and your money and you
[1:00:36] think it's secured it's in the bank and
[1:00:38] the bank is secured and they'd say you
[1:00:40] know FDIC or whatever the acronym is for
[1:00:44] that that it's insured up to you know so
[1:00:46] much money and all my money so secure
[1:00:48] and it's guaranteed it's secured by the
[1:00:50] government and you can say that it's
[1:00:52] secured but it's really not secured the
[1:00:54] dollar can be devalued and lose you lose
[1:00:56] everything tomorrow the whole economic
[1:01:01] world as we notice is is crashed and
[1:01:06] revived and crashed and revived and up
[1:01:08] and down and in even today you know as
[1:01:13] we just think about this what our
[1:01:15] security is in you know maybe you can
[1:01:17] say well my Security's in my health if
[1:01:19] there's one thing that is unsure let me
[1:01:22] say another way if there's one thing
[1:01:24] that sure is there's nothing sure about
[1:01:27] your health and you may live in a body
[1:01:31] without any issues and that's good
[1:01:33] praise you should thank God for them but
[1:01:36] even today your body is breaking down
[1:01:39] every day you live in a cursed earth
[1:01:41] this earth is cursed it's not redeemed
[1:01:45] it's gonna be redeemed one day but it's
[1:01:48] not right now that's why it trips you up
[1:01:50] and messes you up that's why you get
[1:01:52] angry you have a temper that's why you
[1:01:54] still get headaches I'm gonna keep
[1:01:55] preaching until somebody says hey man
[1:01:57] your body's not redeemed it's not born
[1:02:00] again that your soul is translated but
[1:02:03] this flesh you live in is still cursed
[1:02:06] and your body's living every single day
[1:02:10] it's breaking down your body's breaking
[1:02:13] down you're growing closer and closer as
[1:02:15] we spoke on this morning to death and so
[1:02:18] we ask the question today what things
[1:02:20] for the mat are sure what's guaranteed
[1:02:24] what things are there that have no
[1:02:28] uncertainty or job isn't our money isn't
[1:02:31] our health is it even our loved ones
[1:02:35] aren't because you could love someone so
[1:02:39] much today and lose them tomorrow you
[1:02:44] cherish life but life can slip away as
[1:02:47] tight as you grasp it as we learn this
[1:02:51] morning you have no promise James says
[1:02:54] you make plans for tomorrow tomorrow and
[1:02:56] going to such and such a city James says
[1:02:58] you have no promise of tomorrow your
[1:03:01] life is just a vapor here it's gone just
[1:03:04] like that life is life really is all
[1:03:10] about losing this and this this life you
[1:03:14] know we live in a society and if we're
[1:03:16] not careful as believers we're not
[1:03:17] exempt from this but you live in a world
[1:03:20] that worships life hello let that sink
[1:03:27] in for a moment you letting that sink in
[1:03:29] now say man you live in a world that
[1:03:33] worships life they'll spend all of their
[1:03:37] fortune trying to prolong their life do
[1:03:42] whatever they can to try to live and
[1:03:43] live longer and live healthier lives
[1:03:45] stronger and we all none of us none of
[1:03:47] us want to die it's not it's natural
[1:03:49] inside of you but man has perverted that
[1:03:51] the desire to live comes from God
[1:03:54] because one day you are gonna live
[1:03:56] forever and there won't ever be any
[1:03:58] death but man has perverted that life
[1:04:01] and he worships life he worships and
[1:04:04] does everything he can to keep the
[1:04:06] wrinkles away to keep the shoulders
[1:04:08] straight to keep his health up to stay
[1:04:11] and live long and a long and happy and
[1:04:14] healthy life but as David said this
[1:04:19] morning our years are threescore and ten
[1:04:21] if you know if they if and and it by
[1:04:23] strength they're ten years longer than
[1:04:25] that so teach us to number our days that
[1:04:29] we may apply our hearts to wisdom in
[1:04:32] other words David sands so that I can
[1:04:34] live those days with wisdom
[1:04:39] it's all about litt losing I'm just
[1:04:42] gonna be real with you here tonight life
[1:04:45] is all about losing it's all about
[1:04:47] losing you lose strength you lose
[1:04:49] vitality even your mind as you age
[1:04:51] begins to slip you begin to forget
[1:04:57] things even even some of us younger in
[1:05:01] age begin to forget things and your mind
[1:05:04] gets cluttered from things and your ever
[1:05:06] your entire body is breaking down you
[1:05:09] lose your mind begins to slip you begin
[1:05:11] to forget things that you could would
[1:05:13] never have forgotten you lose energy you
[1:05:15] get fatigued easier you're tired easier
[1:05:18] you lose loved ones you lose a whole lot
[1:05:20] in life but I'm so glad for a promise
[1:05:25] that Jesus says whatever you lose in
[1:05:27] this life I will restore tenfold in the
[1:05:31] next life what we realize this is the
[1:05:37] only things that are sure is the Word of
[1:05:43] God let me go further the only things
[1:05:47] that are sure are the promises found in
[1:05:49] this word the only thing that isn't
[1:05:53] fading is the eternal things the only
[1:05:58] thing that's not declining but is
[1:06:01] increasing is the promises of God and
[1:06:04] the divine blessings of God and the
[1:06:06] reality that we possess of another world
[1:06:09] and the power of that world
[1:06:12] some of us by the baptism of the Holy
[1:06:14] Spirit have tasted already in this life
[1:06:18] of the next life Oh am i preaching to
[1:06:21] believers today I have tasted of the
[1:06:24] good things to come I have already
[1:06:26] tasted of a know another life with no
[1:06:28] hurt and no harm and no disease and no
[1:06:31] complex and no stress and no pain and
[1:06:34] I'm looking for a city whose builder and
[1:06:36] maker is God I'm looking at I'm living
[1:06:39] every day of my life to make sure my
[1:06:42] home is secure on the other side
[1:06:45] I've tasted of it you realize every time
[1:06:49] you anointing falls in a church service
[1:06:52] the under the preaching of the word of
[1:06:54] God and you feel that stimulation you're
[1:06:56] tasting of another world you sing songs
[1:06:59] of Zion and the Holy Spirit falls and
[1:07:01] you begin to cry and raise your hands
[1:07:03] what is it it's a taste that's why you
[1:07:05] love it so much because you were made
[1:07:07] not for this negative life you were made
[1:07:10] for a world of a positive life I'm so
[1:07:16] thankful I can say and that's really
[1:07:18] what I have today is thankfulness in my
[1:07:21] heart that I could say thank you God
[1:07:24] that you chose me to experience an taste
[1:07:30] of a world that's coming after this
[1:07:33] world well your anchor hold this is the
[1:07:38] words to the song well your anchor hold
[1:07:41] in the storms of life when the clouds
[1:07:44] unfold their wings of strife when the
[1:07:49] strong tides lift and the cables strain
[1:07:54] will your anchor drift or firm remain
[1:07:59] well your anchor hold and the storms of
[1:08:03] life but we have an anchor that keeps
[1:08:09] the soul its steadfast and short I'm
[1:08:13] thankful for that
[1:08:14] while the billows roll it's fastened to
[1:08:18] Iraq let me change that it's fastened to
[1:08:21] the rock which cannot move it's grounded
[1:08:25] firm and deep in the Savior's love this
[1:08:32] man began to speak and I was just
[1:08:33] listening to him as he began to say that
[1:08:36] you know we really have no hope and you
[1:08:39] know he began to talk about that we have
[1:08:41] no proof of anything you know he was
[1:08:43] just very cynical very bitter that's
[1:08:46] that that's that's what I would describe
[1:08:47] it as is I came away from there as I was
[1:08:50] talking to a very bitter
[1:08:53] individual was very bitter of her life
[1:08:55] is very bitter over disappointments and
[1:08:59] and he began to speak and say oh we you
[1:09:02] know we have no proof and he went
[1:09:06] further and says you know we have no
[1:09:07] hope while we have this he says all we
[1:09:09] have is hope we really don't know I'm
[1:09:12] beginning to think of this word proof
[1:09:14] that it's such a buzzword today what
[1:09:15] proof do you have what evidence he said
[1:09:18] you know we have no proof that when we
[1:09:22] bury our loved ones that we'll ever even
[1:09:23] see him again that might be it we don't
[1:09:25] know no one's ever came back from the
[1:09:27] grave and told us he said you know and
[1:09:32] he began to say he said I aces we have
[1:09:34] no proof you know and in his life he
[1:09:37] begin to say you know I've questioned it
[1:09:39] we don't know anything we don't know if
[1:09:40] there's life after this we don't know if
[1:09:42] there's anything when we breathe their
[1:09:44] last breath that was his exact words he
[1:09:47] said we hope there's a heaven
[1:09:51] we hope there's another life but I
[1:09:54] wanted to stop him and say my brother
[1:09:58] there's there's we have hope there's a
[1:10:01] heaven and I wanted to say brother I
[1:10:03] have more than just human hope I have
[1:10:07] more than just hope job didn't say I
[1:10:10] hope my Redeemer liveth job said I know
[1:10:14] my Redeemer liveth and though the skin
[1:10:18] worms destroy this body what was it
[1:10:20] there's a revelation a reality that
[1:10:23] struck job's heart and he said I know my
[1:10:25] Redeemer liveth and I shall see him oh
[1:10:28] and joke seen him one day brother
[1:10:31] Branham says is he knocked on the door
[1:10:32] paradise job said I know my Redeemer
[1:10:36] liveth at a revelation of vision brother
[1:10:41] Brennan said job seen a vision and it
[1:10:43] wasn't of a say of Jesus of Nazareth it
[1:10:46] was a ver isn't Savior it was of a risen
[1:10:49] it was it was exactly what Joe begin to
[1:10:51] say I see the flowers and they come and
[1:10:53] then they go and look at the tree it
[1:10:54] comes up and wither its then it died and
[1:10:56] it comes back again the leaf leaves and
[1:10:58] it comes back he says but man what is
[1:11:01] man he dies he giveth up the ghost it
[1:11:04] was a complexity something that plagued
[1:11:06] the
[1:11:06] of all Schumann's and it plagues the
[1:11:09] mind of unbelievers today you as a
[1:11:11] believer are the only one who can face
[1:11:14] the subject of death with a certainty in
[1:11:19] your's
[1:11:21] the Bible says that job said I know my
[1:11:26] redeemer liveth because job had a
[1:11:31] reality of another world
[1:11:35] let me say this to you my brother my
[1:11:37] sister if you haven't tasted you can
[1:11:39] taste David said taste and see that the
[1:11:43] Lord is good you can taste it's not just
[1:11:46] a human hope you don't just hope that
[1:11:49] when you bury your loved ones you'll see
[1:11:51] them someday but you've gotten assurance
[1:11:53] it's an assurance of faith because the
[1:11:56] reality of that resurrection has already
[1:11:59] been made real in my own life thank you
[1:12:03] Lord that it's been made real in my own
[1:12:06] life thank you that I could face this
[1:12:10] subject with out fear can you say man
[1:12:14] tonight
[1:12:15] notice what Hebrews chapter 11 says and
[1:12:19] I want you to turn there just for a
[1:12:20] moment now faith is the substance of
[1:12:24] things hoped for the evidence of things
[1:12:28] not seen
[1:12:30] listen to what he says faith is the
[1:12:33] substance when he says substance he says
[1:12:35] that means it's real it has it has
[1:12:39] tangible it means something you can grab
[1:12:42] a hold of faith is the substance of my
[1:12:45] hope let me say it this way faith is not
[1:12:51] a crutch for proof did you hear me
[1:12:57] faith is not a crutch for proof well how
[1:13:02] do you know well I have faith how do you
[1:13:04] know that there's an that there's an
[1:13:07] eternity how do you know there's a
[1:13:08] reality well because I have faith you
[1:13:10] don't use faith as a crutch for your
[1:13:12] proof
[1:13:13] we don't say well you know we don't know
[1:13:16] if there's a heaven we don't really know
[1:13:17] if there's eternal light we don't know
[1:13:18] if Jesus existed we don't know that but
[1:13:21] we hope and because we have faith
[1:13:23] therefore we believe that's Baptist
[1:13:25] theology but let me say to you today
[1:13:28] faith is not a crutch for proof faith is
[1:13:31] the proof faith is my proof because I
[1:13:36] have a revelation in my soul that's my
[1:13:39] proof and I can say today it's a proof
[1:13:43] that there's a risen Savior because
[1:13:45] faith is something you take ahold of
[1:13:48] it's something you can know that you
[1:13:50] know that you know brother Branham said
[1:13:53] it's not a hope so
[1:13:54] it's a no so my outward body can't see
[1:13:57] it my ears can't hear it I can't even
[1:14:00] smell it try to smell I smell a lot of
[1:14:02] things a lot of foul things in this
[1:14:03] world but I can't smell it with my ear I
[1:14:06] can't hear with my ears can't smell it
[1:14:08] with my nose he said for the matter how
[1:14:10] real is that proof that you have I can't
[1:14:12] smell heaven I can't see it with my two
[1:14:14] eyes you know you said well then I guess
[1:14:17] it can't be proven because everything by
[1:14:18] science has to be observable and you got
[1:14:20] to be able to see it you got to be able
[1:14:21] to prove it under scientific experiment
[1:14:24] but by these two eyes by by my mouth I
[1:14:27] can't speak of it to prove it my ears I
[1:14:30] can't hear it naturally but my inner man
[1:14:34] can feel it my inner man can see it my
[1:14:39] inner man already exists in that reality
[1:14:44] that's why I serve the Lord
[1:14:49] Paul said you're seated now together in
[1:14:52] heavenly places in Christ Jesus right
[1:14:54] now you're seated there it's in a
[1:14:58] different dimension not the one my body
[1:15:00] lives in not this one
[1:15:02] hello somebody you say for the mat what
[1:15:06] does that mean that means that unless
[1:15:07] you've been translated by the baptism of
[1:15:10] the Holy Ghost and are sealed already in
[1:15:12] heavenly places in Christ Jesus then you
[1:15:15] can never see the kingdom of God isn't
[1:15:18] that what Jesus said he that is not born
[1:15:23] of the Spirit of God can never see the
[1:15:24] kingdom of God that doesn't mean you
[1:15:27] can't read a Bible come on somebody I
[1:15:31] know it's Sunday night and y'all are
[1:15:32] tired but wake up doesn't mean you can't
[1:15:35] read a Bible everybody can read a Bible
[1:15:37] that doesn't mean you can't let me go
[1:15:39] further than that that doesn't even mean
[1:15:41] that you can't understand some of the
[1:15:43] doctrines of the Bible you can even have
[1:15:46] an intellectual understanding of the
[1:15:48] message but you're still not seeing the
[1:15:51] kingdom of God because the kingdom of
[1:15:54] God is only seen by revelation and
[1:15:57] revelation is faith that's what brother
[1:16:00] Branham preached faith is the sixth
[1:16:03] sense glory it's in another dimension
[1:16:06] and and if you've never experienced that
[1:16:10] then really truly all you have is human
[1:16:14] hope a hope but for the believer for the
[1:16:23] Christian it's not in this dimension
[1:16:25] that these five senses live in but while
[1:16:29] my outward man brother Aaron I can't see
[1:16:31] it it doesn't even fill it all the times
[1:16:33] in fact most of the time this outdoor
[1:16:35] man doesn't even feel like coming to
[1:16:37] church doesn't feel like worshiping the
[1:16:39] Lord sometimes I'm tired I'm weary don't
[1:16:41] feel like serving God but while while my
[1:16:44] outward man can't see it it can't
[1:16:46] explain it and sometimes the best we're
[1:16:48] doing even even sometimes when we start
[1:16:51] talking about Jesus and all he's done
[1:16:54] first and what he means to us all we can
[1:16:56] do is have a broken up explanation
[1:16:59] of our salvation and what it means to be
[1:17:02] born again and some of us try to explain
[1:17:04] it to tell tell some money we try to
[1:17:06] illustrate it with sermons we try to
[1:17:08] preach it to people we try to explain it
[1:17:10] we try to use illustrations we use
[1:17:12] pictures we use tapes we use music what
[1:17:15] are we trying to do we're trying the
[1:17:18] inner man is trying to express something
[1:17:21] to the outward senses that the reality
[1:17:25] really doesn't exist out here
[1:17:26] it exists in here and it's the language
[1:17:30] of the believer and only believers can
[1:17:33] speak that language that's why you can
[1:17:36] get around a believer in Africa or in
[1:17:37] India I've been to China I've got around
[1:17:40] believers that I couldn't speak that
[1:17:42] couldn't speak mandrian but yet when we
[1:17:44] started talking about the word there was
[1:17:46] an instant connection because we spoke
[1:17:49] the same language
[1:17:50] I might not a spoke French I might not
[1:17:52] have spoke a Norwegian when I went to
[1:17:54] Norway I couldn't speak their language
[1:17:55] but when I got around the believer there
[1:17:57] was a connection there was an affinity
[1:17:59] there was a unity because our inner man
[1:18:02] had both while we're both living at the
[1:18:05] same address in the same Kingdom
[1:18:07] speaking the same language desiring the
[1:18:09] same things is the face the language of
[1:18:12] their redeemed I'm glad I speak that
[1:18:17] language say for the man you bilingual I
[1:18:20] am I got a earthly tongue in a heavenly
[1:18:22] tongue sometimes I spring speaking my
[1:18:25] heavenly tongue in prayer I'm glad I got
[1:18:28] it I'm glad I'm one of them you ought to
[1:18:33] be glad about it tonight I'm one of them
[1:18:36] oh I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[1:18:40] those body can't know it can't feel it
[1:18:44] my inward man knows it's real and he's
[1:18:47] living right now anchored in that
[1:18:50] dimension that exists right now oh this
[1:18:54] is what Hebrews six says here and I
[1:18:57] think I had it brother Jordan on the
[1:18:58] PowerPoint you can you can display it if
[1:19:00] you want it was the it was the the
[1:19:03] fourth slide he says in Hebrews six
[1:19:06] verse 18 that by two immutable things in
[1:19:10] which it was impossible for
[1:19:13] odd to lie I'm so glad for them we might
[1:19:16] have a strong consolation I got a
[1:19:21] consolation here tonight who have fled
[1:19:25] for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set
[1:19:29] before us notice this which hope we have
[1:19:33] as an anchor of the soul both sure and
[1:19:37] steadfast and which entereth into that
[1:19:41] within the veil in other words you can't
[1:19:44] see it with your two eyes it's in
[1:19:46] another dimension it's an under the veil
[1:19:48] but it's an anchor
[1:19:49] it's steadfast its Shore while the rest
[1:19:51] of the world and your life may be shaken
[1:19:53] you have one thing you can plant your
[1:19:56] faith you can bank everything on it it's
[1:19:58] not gonna fail
[1:19:59] he's never gonna fail you may fail him I
[1:20:02] may fail him tomorrow but he'll never
[1:20:04] fail me the Bible says it's impossible
[1:20:06] for him to tell a lie and he made a
[1:20:09] promise I'll have a bride she won't have
[1:20:12] spot she won't have wrinkle she won't
[1:20:14] have blemish she'll be perfect in the
[1:20:16] midst of Lady Asiya
[1:20:17] and I say tonight amen to the Word of
[1:20:20] God I believe that in spite of what I
[1:20:22] can feel or what I can see God can't
[1:20:25] tell a lie some notice what he says here
[1:20:30] in Hebrews 6 he says for it's impossible
[1:20:33] for those who were once enlightened the
[1:20:35] slide before this and have tasted of the
[1:20:38] heavenly gift notices as Hebrews 6:4 it
[1:20:42] is impossible for those who were once
[1:20:44] enlightened and tasted of the heavenly
[1:20:46] gift and were made partakers of the Holy
[1:20:51] Ghost
[1:20:52] follow and have tasted the good word of
[1:20:56] God and the powers of the world to come
[1:21:02] now let's identify this person they have
[1:21:06] tasted of the heavenly gift they were
[1:21:10] made partakers didn't say they had the
[1:21:13] Holy Ghost said they were made partakers
[1:21:14] of it and have tasted the good word
[1:21:20] and the powers of the world to come if
[1:21:23] they shall fall away to renew them again
[1:21:27] unto repentance now we know brother and
[1:21:29] preached eternal security on this but he
[1:21:31] also preached this this this right here
[1:21:33] speaking about the man in greens milk
[1:21:34] when he when he when he miss walk I
[1:21:37] think it was where he says that the man
[1:21:39] spoke in tongues the other interpreted
[1:21:40] mother might have said I was a see said
[1:21:42] oh oh boy what a gift he came outside if
[1:21:44] the man had spoken tongues shook his
[1:21:46] hand he said as soon as my hand did his
[1:21:47] hand he said I went into a vision and
[1:21:49] the man he said that man was living with
[1:21:52] another man's wife my brother branham
[1:21:55] quotes this Hebrew 6 and say how he's
[1:21:57] tasted of the good things of God he's
[1:22:00] tasted of the world of God of the world
[1:22:02] the power of the world to come he's been
[1:22:04] made a partaker of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:06] brother Branham says but if as he as
[1:22:09] Paul says if they shall fall away to
[1:22:10] renew them again to repentance
[1:22:12] seeing they crucify to themselves the
[1:22:14] Son of God afresh to put him to an open
[1:22:16] shame he say brother Matt what does that
[1:22:18] mean it means that some have tasted it's
[1:22:21] a spiritual sense of the powers of the
[1:22:25] world to come but let me tell you
[1:22:26] something my brother taste is not enough
[1:22:32] taste is not enough you may speak in
[1:22:36] tongues today and fall away tomorrow
[1:22:39] taste is not enough being a partaker is
[1:22:42] not enough experiencing the power of God
[1:22:45] in a church service it's not enough
[1:22:48] Jesus said you must be born again if
[1:22:53] taste is not enough and for so many
[1:22:55] sadly this is all they ever experienced
[1:23:02] you say how do I taste turn on a tape
[1:23:05] turn on the tape of Malachi 4 go turn on
[1:23:09] a tape of the Prophet you're tasting of
[1:23:11] the good word
[1:23:13] you could even start to partake of that
[1:23:16] but there's more my brother you've got
[1:23:20] to do more than taste you got to do more
[1:23:22] than taste the angel of the Lord told
[1:23:25] angel told John in the Book of
[1:23:27] Revelations go and take the book and eat
[1:23:30] the book you've got to consume the book
[1:23:32] it's got to be more than just a taste
[1:23:34] that you experience you've got to become
[1:23:37] the word oh and I say tonight and maybe
[1:23:40] you can agree with me with an amen
[1:23:42] Lord I don't just want a taste of this
[1:23:44] word I want to eat the book I wanted to
[1:23:46] become part of me I wanted to become how
[1:23:49] I think how'd I live how I act where I
[1:23:51] go what I do I wanted to become me the
[1:23:55] real me not this outside me that's full
[1:23:57] of mistakes and failures but the inner
[1:23:59] man Paul said the outer man dies daily
[1:24:02] but the inner man is renewed day by day
[1:24:07] hallelujah what's Paul saying he's
[1:24:11] saying that this hope doesn't exist in
[1:24:13] this body if all your hope is bottled up
[1:24:17] and your five senses you will end up
[1:24:18] disappointed and sad and depressed if
[1:24:21] you try to get your reality of heaven
[1:24:23] from here you'll end up with doubts and
[1:24:25] questions and fears but the Bible says
[1:24:29] there's an anchor that's behind the
[1:24:30] film's meaning we can't see it with our
[1:24:33] eyes we can't touch it with our hands
[1:24:34] but our soul can experience it every
[1:24:37] single day in fact our soul lives there
[1:24:44] in that reality to know Jesus is the
[1:24:49] same yesterday today and forever that
[1:24:52] he's alive we have an anchor what is it
[1:24:55] it's a consolation within the veil it's
[1:24:58] in another dimension it's a hope but
[1:25:01] it's not a human hope human hope is not
[1:25:05] steadfast and sure but this kind of Hope
[1:25:07] is an anchor for the soul
[1:25:10] same for the mat so unless you've been
[1:25:12] translated you can't even have this hope
[1:25:17] not physically not speaking physically
[1:25:19] here but spiritually and the only way to
[1:25:22] get that hope is to be translated by the
[1:25:26] new birth by the baptism of the Holy
[1:25:28] Ghost by being a go of being born again
[1:25:31] of a new spirit and if you've never been
[1:25:34] born again you've never been translated
[1:25:35] then truly as we said all you can have
[1:25:39] is human hope I don't want human hope
[1:25:42] because it's subject to doubt it's
[1:25:45] subject to questions as we said already
[1:25:50] we live in a world and a society that
[1:25:54] worships like we worship living and and
[1:25:56] and and when we never disconnect for a
[1:25:58] moment and face that reality but let me
[1:26:01] say to say this to you my brother my
[1:26:02] sister if you've been really translated
[1:26:03] you can face the reality the question of
[1:26:06] what happens after I breathe my last
[1:26:09] breath you know what every single person
[1:26:13] faces that question they just face it
[1:26:16] differently and you can either face that
[1:26:20] with fear and doubt and push it out of
[1:26:22] your mind or you can face it with faith
[1:26:24] and assurance and reality say brother
[1:26:30] Matt how do you do that only one reason
[1:26:32] because Jesus rose like
[1:26:36] that's the only reason we can face death
[1:26:40] because he said if I live you shall live
[1:26:44] also whosoever liveth and believeth in
[1:26:48] me he shall never die
[1:26:50] believers brother Brennan said what did
[1:26:52] he say said believers don't die
[1:26:55] imagine believers don't die
[1:26:58] he says death is just as bad as David
[1:27:01] said although I walk through the shadow
[1:27:02] with a shadow of the valley of death I
[1:27:04] will fear no evil thy rod and thy staff
[1:27:07] they comfort me
[1:27:09] but the man says what was that in Psalms
[1:27:11] 27 he says it's because he said I live
[1:27:14] univ also and I am the resurrection and
[1:27:18] I am the life and whosoever believeth in
[1:27:20] me shall never die death to a believer
[1:27:23] is just a vehicle can you say man it can
[1:27:28] be painful and people could die a
[1:27:29] horrible painful way it can be
[1:27:31] tragically too awful someone can die in
[1:27:33] horrible ways but once you're free death
[1:27:36] is just freedom from bondage from a
[1:27:41] prison oh I hope that I hope you believe
[1:27:45] that here tonight this life is all about
[1:27:50] a prison its bars as the song says the
[1:27:54] hills of home were calling me it says
[1:27:57] the bars of flesh are gonna burst wide
[1:28:00] open when the Angels set my spirit free
[1:28:04] what was it it's another dimension
[1:28:06] that's why the song says the bars of
[1:28:09] Clay are going to burst wide open and
[1:28:12] I'm going to take my flight like a
[1:28:14] Mighty Eagle oh my brother my sister
[1:28:17] that's what I thought of my grandfather
[1:28:19] there in the hospital room on a
[1:28:21] ventilator maja spittle room but you
[1:28:25] know they took that ventilator off and
[1:28:27] as soon as they turned it off his heart
[1:28:28] just boom I told my wife I said he
[1:28:31] didn't waste one minute he didn't waste
[1:28:33] one moment he took his flight like a
[1:28:35] mighty Eagle he bursts out of all of
[1:28:37] that pain and all of that sorrow you
[1:28:40] might have lost somebody in this life
[1:28:41] they wouldn't come back to this world
[1:28:43] for one
[1:28:44] minute they've already experienced the
[1:28:47] body without pain and without suffering
[1:28:49] they're in touch with an eternal reality
[1:28:54] that's where the random gives the story
[1:28:56] about that fish he said could you
[1:28:57] imagine ever being a fish and he said
[1:29:00] you know there in that life could you
[1:29:01] come from this intelligent life as a
[1:29:03] human and go live as a fish he said just
[1:29:06] in the water and he says you know
[1:29:08] they're all he knows is the environment
[1:29:09] he says but in that little fish that's
[1:29:11] his entire world it's everything he
[1:29:13] thinks it is what life is as far as he
[1:29:15] knows that's it this is life this is
[1:29:17] everything brother Branham says but if
[1:29:19] you ever take that fish and he said you
[1:29:21] could ever bring him up to this and you
[1:29:22] bring him to a higher form of life he
[1:29:25] could never go back to being a fish
[1:29:27] again
[1:29:27] he said because once he's experienced
[1:29:30] this life it's a higher form of life he
[1:29:32] would never go back
[1:29:34] prophet of God said him once you've ever
[1:29:36] tasted of that heavenly life and that
[1:29:38] heavenly gift how could you ever go back
[1:29:40] to this world of pain and sorrow
[1:29:49] truly what Paul speaks up here and let
[1:29:53] me see what I had after that brother
[1:29:55] Jordan yeah you can just you can mute
[1:29:57] that here just for a moment what you
[1:29:59] realize is that the body the mortal body
[1:30:02] is merely a shell
[1:30:05] there's mortal body as merely just a
[1:30:08] shell
[1:30:09] it's all it is it's a housing probably
[1:30:11] of God call to the vehicle it's like a
[1:30:12] nut shell and inside of it is the real
[1:30:15] life and the life is not in the shell
[1:30:19] life is not in the shell the life is
[1:30:23] what's inside of the shell the shell is
[1:30:26] not for keeping you don't keep the shell
[1:30:31] you dispose of the shell are you with me
[1:30:37] life and that's what a mortal body is
[1:30:39] it's just a shell and life is not in the
[1:30:42] shell and the shell is not for keeping
[1:30:44] it's a temporary dwelling place it's a
[1:30:47] temporal where it's a temporary home and
[1:30:50] what brother Eddie preaches the future
[1:30:51] home of the Briley bride and the
[1:30:53] heavenly bridegroom and he says what is
[1:30:55] it he says that's why the body says win
[1:30:57] this if this Tabernacle be dissolved we
[1:30:59] have one already waiting a body not made
[1:31:02] with hands what is this life this body
[1:31:05] is all a pest house it's just a pest
[1:31:08] house of trouble it's breaking down it's
[1:31:10] dying it's disease that gets hurt it
[1:31:13] gets shake its weak it gets weary it's
[1:31:15] just a shell that's all it is let me say
[1:31:20] this it's a cheap shell compared to the
[1:31:24] shell in heaven it's made in China but
[1:31:30] I've got a body that never breaks down
[1:31:33] no broken parts no defects all no
[1:31:38] defects in that other life I hope you're
[1:31:40] rejoicing in that here tonight and a
[1:31:43] believers been endowed with eternal life
[1:31:45] but the random said it's a gene seed it
[1:31:47] says he caught it
[1:31:48] Zoe so what does Zoe mean it means the
[1:31:51] Zoe the real true life of God he says
[1:31:53] that's worth it that's the real you
[1:31:55] brother Branham says I'm not I realized
[1:31:57] one day I'm not the son of Charles and
[1:31:59] Ella Branham
[1:32:00] that's not who I really am that was my
[1:32:02] life here on earth this isn't the real
[1:32:04] you the real you is the inside you it's
[1:32:07] the inner man that's the real you this
[1:32:12] you does this me causes me trouble
[1:32:16] the real enemy brother man says you look
[1:32:18] in the mirror since I realized my real
[1:32:21] enemy is Bill Brandon tell what I said
[1:32:26] there were enemies william branham he
[1:32:28] says i looked in the mirror says you
[1:32:29] look in the mirror says that's your
[1:32:30] enemy your brother's not your enemy
[1:32:32] that's your enemy go look in the mirror
[1:32:35] he says that's your real enemy he says
[1:32:38] this isn't the real this isn't the real
[1:32:40] me but there's a Zowie there's a gene
[1:32:43] seed of God prophets that was planted
[1:32:46] before the foundation of the world and
[1:32:48] he says you he says Jesus came straight
[1:32:51] from thoughts straight to existence he
[1:32:53] bypassed his theophany he says behold
[1:32:56] but you said what did you do you came
[1:32:58] into this world to be tested to be tried
[1:33:01] to be took for your character to be
[1:33:03] molded and he says in one day you go
[1:33:06] back to that life that real you that
[1:33:08] real existence of who you really were
[1:33:10] before there was ever a you on earth
[1:33:14] that's why brother madam said God says
[1:33:16] to Joe
[1:33:17] where were you Joe when the morning
[1:33:19] stars shouted for glory he says one that
[1:33:21] when I laid the foundations
[1:33:23] remenham says what was he trying to get
[1:33:25] job to understand this life that you
[1:33:28] call life is not really life there was
[1:33:31] another life it's another life you're
[1:33:32] going to job all of this is just a
[1:33:35] negative of a positive
[1:33:41] that makes me happy and if I'm the only
[1:33:45] one happy tonight I'm okay with that
[1:33:48] that makes me happy that makes me shout
[1:33:51] that makes me rejoice to know this isn't
[1:33:55] the real me cuz I'm not happy with this
[1:33:58] guy
[1:34:00] selling roses at family at lunch today I
[1:34:03] said you know people believe we're in
[1:34:05] the Millennium you know my dad always
[1:34:06] says boy if this is the millennium I
[1:34:08] want my money back if this is it this
[1:34:13] life this trouble this this pain this
[1:34:15] world no no but there's a life coming
[1:34:19] and with inside of that jeans seat of
[1:34:22] God
[1:34:22] oh it's within us it's an ever growing
[1:34:25] ever expanding process of development
[1:34:30] your entire Christian life you say
[1:34:32] you're saved but let me just say it this
[1:34:34] way I'm being saved Baptist have coined
[1:34:38] up the old theological terms are you
[1:34:40] saved well no not really
[1:34:43] I mean yeah I'm born again by the spirit
[1:34:45] but I ain't saved yet but I'm gonna be
[1:34:48] saved one day when I can look back at
[1:34:51] the world that's burning it on fire and
[1:34:52] I could say goodbye world that's when I
[1:34:55] can say I'm saved brother Adam says
[1:34:58] that's when they he says a real believer
[1:35:00] he says they'll get on the other heels
[1:35:01] of glory nice a safe I'm safe at last
[1:35:05] safe at last it's an eventual it's an
[1:35:09] ever-growing what is serving the Lord
[1:35:12] brother Matt it's an ever expanding
[1:35:14] process of that gene seed so a seed of
[1:35:17] God coming to maturity are you perfect
[1:35:20] yeah are you perfected yet no I'm not
[1:35:22] he's still working on me and then I'm
[1:35:25] still a project he's still busy working
[1:35:27] on me all I gotta say is Lord don't give
[1:35:30] up on me I'm gonna get there someday
[1:35:32] Lord I'm gonna keep pushing I'm gonna
[1:35:34] keep pressing I'm gonna keep trying
[1:35:35] don't give up on me Jesus one day I'm
[1:35:38] gonna burst wide open one day this inner
[1:35:41] man is gonna take over this outer man
[1:35:43] and Paul says the corruptible will put
[1:35:45] on incorruption this mortal shall put on
[1:35:49] in mortality it'll be a new life it'll
[1:35:53] be a new Kratz why the Bible says Jesus
[1:35:55] was the beginning of the new creation he
[1:35:58] was a whole new human he was a whole new
[1:36:01] life the resurrected Savior what was he
[1:36:05] he was the beginning of a new creation
[1:36:10] it's a maturing the Prophet says in
[1:36:14] every believer has that see gene of God
[1:36:16] that Zoe see gene of life it's planet is
[1:36:19] a little seed and you water that seed
[1:36:22] and you put that seed in the right light
[1:36:24] you put it in the sunlight of God's Word
[1:36:26] brother man and said you put it in the
[1:36:27] right atmosphere and it'll grow it's
[1:36:31] like the seeds they found in the tombs
[1:36:32] of and in Egypt and they pulled out from
[1:36:34] the graves little seeds that had been
[1:36:36] bottled up and just a little a little
[1:36:39] vessel found seeds thousands of years
[1:36:42] old took those same seeds out of the
[1:36:45] coffin out of out of the tombs of the
[1:36:47] mummies planted it in the ground got the
[1:36:49] sunlight got that got the the water
[1:36:51] guess what those seeds came to life why
[1:36:55] it's a law of life the seed is good but
[1:37:00] you've got to get the seed in the right
[1:37:01] atmosphere you got to get it under the
[1:37:03] right anointing you want to be born
[1:37:05] again you got to come in the right
[1:37:06] atmosphere you got to get into the
[1:37:08] Third's you've got to get in the spirit
[1:37:09] brother Branham says you got to get in
[1:37:11] the spirit to receive the Holy Spirit
[1:37:12] you've got to get in the spirit first
[1:37:15] can you say amen to the word tonight
[1:37:20] it's got to grow the seed needs to
[1:37:23] mature and all the while that seed is
[1:37:26] maturing day by day Paul said the the
[1:37:29] outer man is Dinah says but the inner
[1:37:32] man is renewed day by day by day by day
[1:37:35] by day you're feeding on the Word of God
[1:37:37] you're in your prayer closet you're
[1:37:39] communing with the Lord
[1:37:41] you're fighting battles you're in you're
[1:37:43] in a trial one brother said you're
[1:37:44] either in a trial you're coming out of a
[1:37:46] trial or you're about to go into another
[1:37:48] trial one play one way or the other
[1:37:50] you're in it you're going through a
[1:37:51] trial it's all about character it's all
[1:37:54] about molding it's all the while it's in
[1:37:58] this decay
[1:37:59] corrupt shell while it's in this flesh
[1:38:02] full of mistakes full of bad habits full
[1:38:05] of prone to subject to weakness the
[1:38:07] sickness to disease full of questions
[1:38:10] full of fears and all the while it's
[1:38:14] taking place not what you see on the
[1:38:17] outside it's what's happening in the
[1:38:21] inside outside the bodies dad died Paul
[1:38:25] said but the inner man's being renewed
[1:38:26] day by day a day he's becoming more
[1:38:29] alive more vibrant more strong he's not
[1:38:33] declining he's ascending he's in the
[1:38:35] process of maturity you're laying in the
[1:38:38] presence of the Sun you're ripening in
[1:38:41] the presence of the Sun ever developing
[1:38:43] ever expanding eventually you say for
[1:38:46] them at what happens eventually like a
[1:38:48] little chicken it eventually pecks its
[1:38:51] way at that outer shell and one day the
[1:38:54] big pops through and then it rips the
[1:38:58] shell and one day that inner man burst
[1:39:01] Oh Paul said oh and death shall be
[1:39:04] swallowed up in victory what is death
[1:39:08] this is death right here in one day one
[1:39:10] day this death is going to be swallowed
[1:39:12] up in life in everlasting life
[1:39:15] oh he's in the process of maturing ever
[1:39:19] expanding until that inner man breaks
[1:39:21] through the shell of this out of man and
[1:39:23] then the real you will be exposed
[1:39:29] Paul said oh I don't know what we shall
[1:39:32] be but we shall be like him in his very
[1:39:38] image not there now
[1:39:43] but that's okay because this is just a
[1:39:46] shell this is just an outer tabernacle a
[1:39:51] vehicle a body oh and the life that
[1:39:55] Zooey life of God pressurizes it puts
[1:39:58] pressure on that shell the outer shell
[1:40:01] oh and and then what happens those
[1:40:05] artificial bounds are broken oh and the
[1:40:08] soul is freed from the prison you know I
[1:40:13] always heard it said this body all it's
[1:40:15] just a pest how so I was wondering what
[1:40:16] that meant as a little boy what is it
[1:40:19] pest house what does that mean means you
[1:40:21] got a house with a bunch of pests inside
[1:40:23] of it it's a pest house always heard
[1:40:28] that expression you know I realized that
[1:40:29] more and more every day how true that is
[1:40:32] that this body is so limited from what
[1:40:36] my inner man wants to Express
[1:40:39] I can't even worship him in the way that
[1:40:42] my inner man really wants to worship him
[1:40:44] because I'm limited by this body
[1:40:52] [Applause]
[1:40:57] amen amen
[1:41:00] y'all were supposed to sing amen do you
[1:41:04] love him
[1:41:06] [Music]
[1:41:07] do you love him Amy do you love him amen
[1:41:16] amen amen
[1:41:21] you think anybody you got a lost loved
[1:41:24] one you think they'd come back for one
[1:41:27] moment to this limited confined body
[1:41:30] after being in that new body brother
[1:41:34] Brandon preaches and garnet Peaks
[1:41:35] funeral he begins to speak and he he
[1:41:38] says there I think I had that brother
[1:41:39] Jordan on the last slide he begins to
[1:41:42] speak it and this he says he's gone from
[1:41:44] us we realized that but he says I wonder
[1:41:47] if really there's such a thing as this
[1:41:49] being the end of it we're all conscious
[1:41:52] that that boy is going from us it's life
[1:41:54] but let's think I love this I gotta in
[1:41:58] bold what's next is there anything we
[1:42:02] could say could we ever see him again is
[1:42:04] this the last we're gonna see of garnet
[1:42:08] can you be sure that we're gonna see him
[1:42:12] again Jobe ask this question the oldest
[1:42:14] book in the Bible he said if a man die
[1:42:16] shall he live again is there any proof
[1:42:18] then that this is so could we have any
[1:42:21] physical proof that this resurrection is
[1:42:25] so it begins to talk about that leaf
[1:42:28] brother and it begins to illustrate that
[1:42:31] and because I say you watch that tree
[1:42:34] and he says did you take that life and
[1:42:36] he says you take the leaf he says what
[1:42:39] is that leaf of that tree it's the
[1:42:40] expression it's all of the vibrancy all
[1:42:43] of the vitality all of the potential of
[1:42:45] that trees and that leaf and he says
[1:42:48] that it blends and it makes shade for
[1:42:50] every pastor behind and he says oh and
[1:42:53] what is it it's a sign of life there's
[1:42:55] life from that little leaf and he says
[1:42:58] oh it just springs up he said it just
[1:43:00] lives it it lives he says every day it's
[1:43:03] it waves in the wind he said just
[1:43:05] praising the Lord all the time and he
[1:43:08] says but you watch he says that's that
[1:43:10] that's that's in that season of life he
[1:43:13] says that season of life he says but
[1:43:15] then he says watch what happens
[1:43:17] says the winner what is it he says the
[1:43:19] season changes you ever you know I know
[1:43:23] we remember there was talking about that
[1:43:24] today I know y'all don't experience a
[1:43:26] lot of seasons here in Tucson we don't
[1:43:29] actually back home experience it's real
[1:43:31] short were there we don't experience a
[1:43:33] lot of them back home either where our
[1:43:34] weather is very much the same except for
[1:43:37] about three times as much humidity but
[1:43:41] you you you you notice all the seasons
[1:43:44] of life as we spoke on it this morning
[1:43:46] prophet of God says what is this is that
[1:43:48] season changes you can feel you can feel
[1:43:51] it back home you can feel when we're
[1:43:53] going from winter to spring though we
[1:43:55] don't have much of a winter at all you
[1:43:57] know it's very similar to here but you
[1:43:59] can feel something almost in the
[1:44:01] atmosphere you could almost feel
[1:44:04] something's changed you walk outside you
[1:44:06] smell smells of pollen and pine pollen
[1:44:09] and oak pollen things you've never
[1:44:11] experienced you never had yeah I had it
[1:44:13] all through the winter and suddenly got
[1:44:16] that season changes and you can just you
[1:44:19] feel that something's coming the Jasmine
[1:44:21] starts to bloom and you smell the the
[1:44:23] the smell of you see all the green that
[1:44:27] that life of that brown life starts to
[1:44:29] turn green and starts to get real bright
[1:44:31] and almost in the middle of spring man
[1:44:32] it's just it's almost neon colored it's
[1:44:35] so bright green and it's my favorite
[1:44:38] time of year the spring season cuz that
[1:44:41] means turkey season and that's pretty
[1:44:42] much like heaven to me heaven on this
[1:44:44] side and and you can just feel the
[1:44:47] atmosphere shift and you feel it change
[1:44:49] but the band says watch what happens you
[1:44:51] said that leaf is in the fullness of its
[1:44:53] life he says but then you feel this to
[1:44:55] change and he says and that leaf begins
[1:44:58] to he says it just begins to lower from
[1:45:01] the stem and go lower and he says and
[1:45:04] then two gets colder and he says the
[1:45:06] winter begins to come on and he says
[1:45:08] then the wind one wind blow and he says
[1:45:13] and that leaf will just detach he says
[1:45:15] and you watch that life that used to be
[1:45:19] and he says what is he says life death
[1:45:22] and he says then you watch that death
[1:45:24] and you said you could watch it as it
[1:45:26] spins around and it makes its way to the
[1:45:28] earth and he says and then it falls and
[1:45:31] it hits the ground and he says and then
[1:45:34] after a while it says the wind begins to
[1:45:36] blow and he says it blows the soil
[1:45:38] overtop of that leaf and what does it do
[1:45:40] he says it buries that leaf and he says
[1:45:44] and what used to be life he says what do
[1:45:46] you have you have death you have burial
[1:45:50] and he says what is it it's it's all
[1:45:53] creation it's all nature that's why Paul
[1:45:56] says in Romans nine he says men will be
[1:45:59] without excuse because even nature cries
[1:46:03] out from the glory of God even nature
[1:46:05] exhibits in itself death and burial and
[1:46:09] resurrection and he says you watch that
[1:46:12] leaf he says as it's buried and he says
[1:46:15] and all the life leaves it and he says
[1:46:18] and he says and what used to be he says
[1:46:20] you watch that little leaf he says it's
[1:46:22] going there he says you know it's you
[1:46:24] may have lost a loved one in this life
[1:46:26] as you watch us maybe they were bright
[1:46:28] vibrant but she watches their life
[1:46:30] begins to fade and then you bury you
[1:46:32] bury that loved one he says what is it's
[1:46:34] a season of death brother Branham says
[1:46:39] what is it he says some voice some
[1:46:41] mechanism he says when that winter
[1:46:43] begins to come he says some voice he
[1:46:46] says tells that SAP and that tree to
[1:46:48] leave the tree and he says and that SAP
[1:46:50] goes down inside of all the life leaves
[1:46:53] the the tree the the the in the inward
[1:46:56] trees we spoke on it this morning and
[1:46:58] all that SAP goes down and to the roots
[1:47:01] he says science you know they can they
[1:47:03] can break it apart they can put a letter
[1:47:04] a molecule they can study it he says but
[1:47:07] they'll never find the germ of life
[1:47:10] because it's a mystery it's a mystery
[1:47:14] God holds for himself
[1:47:17] it's like the the the the you know the
[1:47:20] story of the scientist who got so
[1:47:22] scientific and said oh we don't need God
[1:47:24] you know we can week week we can create
[1:47:26] organs we artificial hearts and
[1:47:28] artificial skin we could create
[1:47:29] artificial hair we don't need God we
[1:47:31] don't need to create it would even need
[1:47:32] God sciences Excel to such a point God
[1:47:36] says you don't need me to say we don't
[1:47:37] need you anymore guys so we can build
[1:47:39] our own man we can build eyes we can
[1:47:41] build hands we could build hair god says
[1:47:44] ok no problem but get your own dirt it's
[1:47:50] your own dirt are you gonna get dirt
[1:47:52] from what is it brother man it says it's
[1:47:54] the mystery the germ of life is a
[1:47:56] mystery he says they could break it down
[1:47:58] he says they don't even understand what
[1:48:01] intelligence in that tree tells that SAP
[1:48:03] to leave the tree because if the SAP was
[1:48:05] the stay in the tree it freeze and break
[1:48:07] in the tree would die he says but
[1:48:09] there's some mystery of life he says
[1:48:12] it's a mixture of life and intelligence
[1:48:14] inside that tree he says that Allah
[1:48:16] tells the SAP to leave the tree and to
[1:48:18] go into the earth again and he says they
[1:48:20] can't explain it but it's the mystery of
[1:48:22] God and brother Brennan says and that
[1:48:24] proves what it proves there's life it
[1:48:27] proves there's death it proves there's a
[1:48:29] burial he says but you just wait and he
[1:48:33] says and when that season of spring wind
[1:48:36] begins to blow he said nothing can stop
[1:48:39] that sap from coming back in that tree
[1:48:42] again and he says in that little leaf
[1:48:44] that died that was buried poof sprouts
[1:48:47] again prophet of God said you may bury a
[1:48:50] loved one in this life you may have
[1:48:51] appreciated them for this life may have
[1:48:53] buried him in a cemetery he says all but
[1:48:55] one resurrection morning when their
[1:48:58] season of the resurrection he says
[1:49:00] nothing will stop those dead loved ones
[1:49:03] and dead Saints from coming out of the
[1:49:05] ground why it's a law and a but a
[1:49:08] mystery of life death
[1:49:13] burial resurrection Oh heaven declares
[1:49:18] the glory of the risen Lord Oh heaven
[1:49:24] and all earth declare of his glory and
[1:49:29] death if the musicians could come it's
[1:49:34] just a mere breaking of that fragile
[1:49:37] shell let me say this to you at the
[1:49:41] precise moment is what the Lord led us
[1:49:45] to preach on so I'm not going to try to
[1:49:47] explain God I'm just going to be
[1:49:49] obedient at the precise moment that God
[1:49:56] decides our shell has fulfilled its
[1:49:59] purpose
[1:50:02] got tasty and the death of his Saints
[1:50:07] are appointed that's why we don't fear
[1:50:12] we sorrow but Jesus says but don't
[1:50:15] sorrow is the world sorrows who has no
[1:50:19] hope no sorrow is the world Jesus says
[1:50:25] he says you but you believe in God
[1:50:27] believe also in me in my father's house
[1:50:30] are many mansions if it weren't so would
[1:50:32] had told you he says but I go and
[1:50:34] prepare a place and he says and if I go
[1:50:36] I'll come back to receive you to take
[1:50:38] you to that place it's an eternal
[1:50:41] reality it's an internal reality it's a
[1:50:47] reality the Apostle Paul had in
[1:50:49] Philippians 1 verse 21 such a reality
[1:50:55] that this man had notice what he says
[1:50:58] Philippians 1 brothers verse Philippians
[1:51:02] 1 verse 20
[1:51:06] notice the reality of this man who lived
[1:51:08] life full life and he says for to me
[1:51:15] to live is Christ and to die
[1:51:19] [Music]
[1:51:22] it's all crazy
[1:51:25] it's out of his mind or was Paul in
[1:51:29] touch that you talk like that is
[1:51:36] completely foreign to the world today
[1:51:38] completely absent we become as we said
[1:51:43] they they they they desire so little
[1:51:45] then won't life life life Paul says Paul
[1:51:48] says it this way he says for I am in a
[1:51:50] strait betwixt having a desire to depart
[1:51:54] and to be with Christ which is far
[1:51:58] better he says yet for your sake for
[1:52:04] what for the sake of edification of the
[1:52:06] believers for the edification to ground
[1:52:08] the converts that he had he says I'll
[1:52:11] stay in the shell for now he says I'll
[1:52:15] abide in the flesh it's what Paul says
[1:52:17] he says having a desire to the part to
[1:52:19] be with Christ which is far better verse
[1:52:20] 24 he says nevertheless to abide in the
[1:52:24] flesh is more needful for you
[1:52:29] asked that question today what a Paul no
[1:52:33] where's the world don't know Paul says
[1:52:37] you know he would Paul showing a lack of
[1:52:40] respect for life no Paul lived his life
[1:52:44] well Paul let me just let me just let me
[1:52:48] just I'm burning my heart Harris we're
[1:52:50] close because I'm just gonna feel
[1:52:51] unsatisfied of his stuff
[1:52:54] Paul said I thought I kept in other
[1:53:05] words Paul was saying I didn't waste
[1:53:07] precious life God gave me he didn't sit
[1:53:11] there I just want to die I just want to
[1:53:13] go you don't know none of us wouldn't
[1:53:14] say that here today none of us would say
[1:53:15] here no I just can't wait I can't wait
[1:53:17] for life to be over can't wait no none
[1:53:19] of us all of us have a desire to live
[1:53:20] forever it comes from God but what Paul
[1:53:23] said is I've lived my life
[1:53:24] well I've ran my race well I've counted
[1:53:28] I've counted every day that I've had
[1:53:29] I've made use of everything God has
[1:53:32] given me and I say today Lord let me
[1:53:35] make use of the life that you've put in
[1:53:37] my body Lord let me make let me use the
[1:53:40] breath can you say that today let me use
[1:53:42] the breath you've given me which is a
[1:53:44] gift from God let me use it in the right
[1:53:47] way let me use the word and the tongues
[1:53:51] and the thoughts and the inspiration to
[1:53:53] express life to other people not
[1:53:57] [Music]
[1:54:00] let me use the life you've given me for
[1:54:05] a good purpose T'Pol life was just that
[1:54:10] it was a gift
[1:54:11] Oh can we realize can we recognize that
[1:54:14] as believers here today you got a gift
[1:54:16] which you're here today
[1:54:18] what are you doing that gift standing
[1:54:23] here for you
[1:54:29] Paul it overcome the fear what he called
[1:54:32] the steam death that's why I could say
[1:54:37] it's better to die and be with the Lord
[1:54:40] than the standard let me say it this way
[1:54:44] those who die in Christ we say all we
[1:54:48] lost we lost we lost you know what they
[1:54:51] they didn't lose they won were the
[1:54:54] losers yeah they're the winners it's
[1:55:00] been that way preach anonymous
[1:55:02] the Holy Spirit doesn't begin to stir my
[1:55:03] heart number your counter days
[1:55:06] appreciate every bit of life God gives
[1:55:08] you make it count make every moment
[1:55:11] count you have with your loved ones with
[1:55:13] those that are around you with those
[1:55:14] that God has surrounded you with what
[1:55:17] are you giving out do I give out
[1:55:20] bitterness and anger and do I get out
[1:55:22] frustrations I give out jealousies
[1:55:24] listen my brother my sister life is too
[1:55:26] precious to spend it bitter over
[1:55:29] something that happened to you life is
[1:55:31] too precious to spend it and hatefulness
[1:55:33] and and and ending and tearing down
[1:55:35] somebody or represented somebody or
[1:55:38] criticizing somebody life is too
[1:55:41] precious you ought to use it for the
[1:55:43] right
[1:55:44] thing by your heads with me if you could
[1:55:47] hear today
[1:55:49] [Music]
[1:55:56] [Music]
[1:56:04] we look at lofts in such a different way
[1:56:06] in this perspective of humanity it's
[1:56:11] tragic and tragedy you go through as we
[1:56:14] said this morning life is all about
[1:56:15] losing this life it's all about losing
[1:56:18] you may not have experienced that yet
[1:56:20] maybe you're young if you go through
[1:56:22] this life it's about good times and bad
[1:56:25] time - Solomon says - everything there's
[1:56:28] a season the time to be born a time to
[1:56:30] die time to shell time the dance time to
[1:56:32] cry time to mourn time to laugh it's all
[1:56:35] about the balance of serving God and
[1:56:39] balancing all of them
[1:56:42] oh we lost so much old but let me say to
[1:56:45] you maybe you've lost I'm just gonna say
[1:56:47] this because the Holy Spirit impressed
[1:56:49] upon my heart maybe you've lost someone
[1:56:51] in your life but let me say you might
[1:56:54] look at that as lost but if your
[1:56:55] spiritual eyes and spiritual ears if God
[1:56:58] could just open your spiritual ears just
[1:57:00] for a moment if he could open your
[1:57:02] spiritual eyes and you could look beyond
[1:57:04] the curtain you'd see that dear loved
[1:57:06] one on God's side of the universe
[1:57:09] walking and then under the pure crystal
[1:57:11] river of eternal life as they begin to
[1:57:14] shout I won I won I'm free and last
[1:57:18] Opress own dear people of Earth they're
[1:57:22] those that are in life there's nothing
[1:57:24] to fear death has no stink
[1:57:28] it's real life it's real joy it's real
[1:57:32] happiness thrill living it's the
[1:57:35] positive to this negative and let me say
[1:57:40] this Satan cannot destroy a child of God
[1:57:43] Satan might be permitted to touch job's
[1:57:46] life the choice flesh afflict his body
[1:57:49] but he couldn't take his life because
[1:57:52] garlic God gives life and God takes life
[1:58:01] that's what Paul says in Romans 8
[1:58:03] I reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:58:06] present time are not worthy to be
[1:58:09] compared with the glory
[1:58:12] would shall be revealed enough oh maybe
[1:58:15] you're here tonight
[1:58:16] you just wanna raise a hand say Lord let
[1:58:19] me taste of that internal reality all I
[1:58:22] can become soul so finite in my thinking
[1:58:26] so earthbound today Lord I want to
[1:58:29] become heaven bound I want to look to
[1:58:31] heavenly things it's Paul said think
[1:58:34] things that are lovely things that are
[1:58:36] pure things that are of a good report if
[1:58:38] there be any praise if their being at
[1:58:40] glory think own these things
[1:58:47] take on these thing Lord Jesus
[1:58:54] so glad some happy in her heart
[1:58:59] we have an anchor it keeps this
[1:59:06] steadfast
[1:59:08] sure
[1:59:12] oh god it's fastened to a rock - the
[1:59:16] rock that cannot move this world shaking
[1:59:22] Lord it's shaking
[1:59:24] it's quaking it's moving Lord it's
[1:59:27] filled with swift transition changes
[1:59:32] every day Lord but we have a hope that
[1:59:36] never changes one that's ever sure one
[1:59:39] that remains the same though the whole
[1:59:42] world gives OH
[1:59:45] on Christ the solid rock I stand all
[1:59:47] other ground is sinking sand I put my
[1:59:50] hope I put my confidence I put my faith
[1:59:54] not in this life not in what I can see
[1:59:57] not on what I could hear bold but want
[2:00:00] that inner man long but that inner man
[2:00:02] cries out for Lord that's life that's
[2:00:05] the real me help me to be help us to be

[2:00:36] days of our life how we spend our time
