[6:52] Yes. Praise the Lord. Brother Ed, could
[6:55] you come open in a word of prayer
[6:57] tonight? I didn't get any prayer
[6:59] requests sent to me. Uh, Brother Daniel
[7:03] sent me something he wanted to say.
[7:08] He said, "Please greet the congregation
[7:10] for me. Tell them I love them and I wish
[7:14] I was there in all caps."
[7:17] And he said, "This project going on has
[7:19] been in the work for a couple years
[7:21] now." I know it's pretty stressful and a
[7:23] pretty big deal. I don't know exactly
[7:25] how or why it's a big deal, but I know
[7:27] it's a big deal. Let's pray for him
[7:29] tonight. Brother Ed,
[7:32] [Music]
[7:36] it's good to be in the house of the
[7:37] Lord. Let's go to the Lord in prayer.
[7:40] Gracious heavenly father, we're thankful
[7:43] to be here tonight. And Lord, we'd like
[7:46] to invite you into our midst this
[7:48] evening.
[7:50] Lord, your word says where two or three
[7:52] are gathered, you'd be in our midst. So
[7:54] Lord, we're inviting you. Allow your
[7:57] sweet spirit to move up and down the
[7:59] aisles.
[8:01] Make yourself known. Bless our brother
[8:04] that's going to bring forth the word,
[8:06] Lord, tonight. Anoint them. Anoint our
[8:09] hearts and ears to hear and to receive.
[8:12] Lord, we'd ask that you'd be with our
[8:14] pastor,
[8:16] Lord. Just strengthen them. Use them for
[8:18] your honor and glory.
[8:20] give him that which he has need of to
[8:22] accomplish his work.
[8:24] Lord, those that aren't able to be with
[8:26] us, we'd ask that you'd be with them
[8:28] also.
[8:29] Those that are streaming,
[8:32] go forth and just bless them, Lord, as
[8:35] we would be blessed tonight.
[8:38] Be in the remainder of the service in
[8:40] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[8:45] Thank you, brother Ed. Shake someone's
[8:48] hand.

[18:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Should bow our heads. And
[18:50] there's not a reason, Lord, why we could
[18:53] not or should not bless you and worship
[18:56] you, Lord.
[18:58] You're our life. You're our strength.
[19:00] You're our everything, Lord. Without
[19:02] you, we are nothing.
[19:04] We just want to say we love you and we
[19:06] appreciate you, Lord.
[19:09] Where would we be without you, Lord?
[19:12] Thank you for for allowing us to be
[19:15] here, Lord. But even more, thank you for
[19:17] you being here with us today, Lord, in
[19:20] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Thank you.
[19:24] You may be seated. Thank you.
[19:28] Good to be in the house of the Lord
[19:30] today.
[19:32] There are many that would love to have a
[19:34] place to fellowship and they don't.
[19:36] But God's good to us. So,
[19:41] Brother Dan sent me a text earlier today
[19:44] asking if we would be ready and I said
[19:46] yes. I responded, "Hey, are you busy?"
[19:49] And he said, "Very, very busy."
[19:52] back there and also sent a text to
[19:55] brother Jordan knowing that they were
[19:57] back on towards the east coast and
[20:01] checking to see if they had uh the
[20:03] storms had been but they said they had
[20:06] gone to the west side of North Carolina
[20:09] so they were away from the coast and
[20:12] and so just God watches over us.
[20:18] This evening, I just
[20:20] I had had this thought already when
[20:24] brother Dan asked me if I could minister
[20:27] and he asked if we could still stay on
[20:29] on the line of of prayer, of seeking the
[20:33] Lord.
[20:35] And I said, I've already had a thought
[20:38] in mind, and that was the word that came
[20:39] to mind was seek, seeking.
[20:43] And I said, "So, we can tie that in
[20:45] because when we're seeking the Lord and
[20:48] his ways, a lot of that is in prayer.
[20:51] We can read his word. We can we can see
[20:54] what he says." But he wants to talk with
[20:56] us and he wants to to just share himself
[20:59] with us. And
[21:02] you say, "Well, I'm not I'm not worth
[21:04] it. I I'm not worthy of it." You know
[21:06] how much he thought of you? He died for
[21:07] you.
[21:09] So he considered you worthy of of his
[21:12] fellowship, worthy of his time. It
[21:14] reminded me as I was thinking about this
[21:16] when brother Brandham was up on the
[21:18] mountains and the storm came over and
[21:21] brother Brandham turned to go back to
[21:24] get away from the storm and the and the
[21:26] Lord said, "I'm enjoying my fellowship
[21:28] with you. Why don't you just speak that
[21:30] storm away?"
[21:32] And you know, it's sometimes we we we
[21:35] feel that Lord, why would you want to
[21:37] talk to me? Why would you want to be
[21:39] around me? Look at look at how I am.
[21:41] Look at who I am. And he says, "Because
[21:43] I care for you. I love you. You're part
[21:46] of me." He said, "I cared for you so
[21:48] much that I knew that I would have to
[21:50] give my life for you." And I said, "I'll
[21:52] do it." So it's, you know, so it shows
[21:56] that his desire for you is great
[21:59] that he would give his life. show.
[22:03] Hebrews 11:6 and I don't know if I gave
[22:06] you this the scripture or not because I
[22:07] just added it on it.
[22:10] It's but without faith it is impossible
[22:12] to please him. For he that cometh to God
[22:15] must believe that he is and that he is a
[22:19] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[22:21] him.
[22:24] So
[22:25] sometimes maybe my thought of the word
[22:28] diligence to do my do diligence or some
[22:32] may be a little different than somebody.
[22:33] So I I just pulled up a defi definitions
[22:35] diligently diligence
[22:38] having or showing care and consciousness
[22:41] in one's work or duty.
[22:45] performing task with thoroughess and an
[22:48] effort from start to finish where one
[22:51] can be counted on to follow through on
[22:53] the commitment and the responsibilities.
[22:55] Now God did that already.
[22:59] You know he was there on the cross and
[23:00] he or he was coming to the cross and he
[23:02] asked father or was on the cross is
[23:05] there another way we could do this
[23:08] than what I'm having to go through right
[23:09] now but he said not my will but thy will
[23:12] be done.
[23:15] And as diligent is to be active,
[23:17] persistent and there's attentiveness,
[23:20] paying attention to it, you know, uh
[23:23] careful and persevering in carrying out
[23:26] tasks or duties.
[23:29] Today I I uh we were been working in the
[23:31] car and I I took it by the shop there
[23:33] where Eleaser and JJ have and we were
[23:37] talking about maintenance,
[23:39] taking care of something before it
[23:41] becomes a problem. And you know, a lot
[23:44] of times we take the car into the shop
[23:45] when it's a problem and you there your
[23:48] newer cars, they have all kinds of the
[23:51] lights that go on and tell you there is
[23:53] something going on, you know, but
[23:56] there's maintenance,
[23:59] there's oil changes, there's checking
[24:00] the pressure on the tire, there's
[24:02] certain things that you can do daily
[24:04] that will keep the car running better,
[24:07] you know, and and things like that. But
[24:09] it's usually when there's a problem that
[24:12] we go to the mechanic
[24:14] or we do it ourselves.
[24:17] And sometimes it's with God the same
[24:19] way. We begin to seek God when we got a
[24:22] problem.
[24:24] &gt;&gt; When everything's
[24:26] smooth, everything seems going good.
[24:28] Hey, thank you, Lord. And then we get on
[24:30] our way and we get going.
[24:32] But you know, he wants that fellowship
[24:34] with you.
[24:35] &gt;&gt; He wants to talk with you. He wants to
[24:38] share with you and and it's not
[24:42] he's eternal.
[24:44] You can't you can't come to the end of
[24:46] the book. There is no end of the book.
[24:48] It's eternal.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; It's daily. So So again, he's a rewarder
[24:54] of them that diligently seek him. So you
[24:57] give time, you give effort. And I know
[25:00] sometimes at the end of the day, you're
[25:02] tired. It's been a long day. It's been
[25:03] frustrating. But five minutes in his
[25:06] presence can undo everything that went
[25:09] wrong on the day.
[25:10] &gt;&gt; Uh he'll come and meet with you. And
[25:13] it's just something we do. So as I got
[25:16] these thoughts and I began to think
[25:18] about it and brother Daniel asked me if
[25:20] I would could minister and I said okay.
[25:22] And he said can you keep kind of on the
[25:25] same subject with especially with prayer
[25:28] and I said yeah I'm already on that line
[25:30] there.
[25:31] And as I just began to think about this
[25:34] and and it's making an effort to seek
[25:38] the kingdom of God.
[25:40] We make an effort for a lot of things.
[25:43] Um you know to prepare ourselves for
[25:46] this to go over there to you know
[25:47] whatever it is. We they there there was
[25:51] a a memorial service this this past
[25:53] Saturday here at the church and came in
[25:57] and got here early and got the sound
[25:59] system ready. help them get set up and
[26:02] do because there was we were making
[26:04] preparations for it to go as as as well
[26:07] as it could, you know, and then of
[26:09] course after it's all done then there's
[26:11] cleanup which is still part of what
[26:13] you're doing.
[26:15] It doesn't stop just because everybody
[26:17] left there there's there's a continual
[26:20] thing going on. And and it started with
[26:23] this when I was thinking I said, you
[26:25] know, I looked up the word seek in the
[26:28] Bible and there was quite a few times
[26:30] the word seek is used. And I was looking
[26:33] specifically where God is asking
[26:37] or saying something long, seek me, look
[26:40] for me, call upon my name. Not go seek
[26:45] like David said, go seek if so and so
[26:47] was here. That's not we're talking about
[26:49] let's let's let's seek God. But it
[26:51] brought me to this Genesis 3 8 and9
[26:55] because the first one that came seeking
[26:59] was God came seeking Adam and Eve there
[27:03] that day. So Genesis 3:8-9 and they
[27:08] heard the voice of the Lord God walk God
[27:11] walking the garden in the cool of the
[27:13] day. And Adam and his wife hid
[27:15] themselves from the presence of the Lord
[27:17] God amongst the trees of the garden.
[27:22] And the Lord God called unto Adam and
[27:24] said unto him, "Where art thou?"
[27:29] God knew what had happened. There was no
[27:32] surprise. There was like a, "Hey, hey, I
[27:34] I'm going to have to go find out what
[27:35] we're going to do about this." He knew
[27:36] exactly what had happened. Yet, he came
[27:38] down to talk with him
[27:41] &gt;&gt; to knowing what's going and he said he
[27:44] came down and and he said, "Where art
[27:47] thou?" knowing where he was, Adam had to
[27:50] respond.
[27:52] And sometimes God will get you in a
[27:54] situation and he'll ask you, "Why are
[27:57] you here? What got you here?
[28:00] &gt;&gt; What was the cause?" Why? Because we
[28:03] want to. He wants to work on that. Wants
[28:05] to begin to Okay. A good teacher, a good
[28:08] school teacher didn't fill out the
[28:11] answers for you.
[28:13] They gave you the test. They gave you
[28:15] the lessons. and they helped you learn.
[28:20] And that's how God works. And we're
[28:21] going to go through this together.
[28:24] 1 Chronicles
[28:26] 28:9.
[28:30] And it's, "And thou, Solomon, my son,
[28:33] know
[28:35] that one's kind of cut off there. Let me
[28:37] read it here. And thou, Solomon, my son,
[28:39] know thou the God of thy father, and
[28:43] serve him with a perfect heart, and with
[28:46] a willing mind. For the Lord searches
[28:49] all hearts, and understand all the
[28:51] imaginations of the thoughts.
[28:54] If thou seek him, he will be found of
[28:57] thee. But if thou forsake him, he will
[29:01] cast thee off forever.
[29:05] It says, "If you'll look for him, he
[29:07] will be found of thee." And sometimes in
[29:10] our seeking and and our looking and our
[29:13] our wanting, we may go a certain
[29:15] direction, a certain way. We think this
[29:17] would be the best way. Um
[29:20] and and but God knows the way to get
[29:23] your attention and draw you. We know
[29:25] that Moses had had left Egypt. He had
[29:28] fle flown out back and he's on the back
[29:30] side of the desert and he's walking
[29:32] taking care of the sheep. God knew where
[29:35] Moses was going to come through and he
[29:37] met him in that burning bush of fire.
[29:40] God was there already because knowing
[29:42] that there was going to be a meeting
[29:44] place there. Sometimes you get in a
[29:47] situation you wonder how did I get here?
[29:49] God says because you're going we're
[29:51] going to meet here and we're going to
[29:52] have some fellowship. It it reminds me
[29:55] of the time and I I said, "Well, brother
[29:57] Brandon was was up there on that
[29:59] mountain and he turns to go from the
[30:02] storm and God says, "Speak to it because
[30:05] we're having fellowship. I'm I'm
[30:06] enjoying my time with you."
[30:10] And then on in 2 Chronicles
[30:13] 15:15
[30:16] and it says, "And all Judah rejoiced at
[30:18] the oath, for they had sworn with all
[30:21] their heart and sought him with their
[30:24] whole desire, and he was found of them,
[30:27] and the Lord gave them rest roundout."
[30:32] They sought him. They looked at him.
[30:34] They said, "Lord, we wanted we want to
[30:37] be where you are. We want you to be
[30:39] where we are.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; You know what Moses said? He says, "If
[30:43] you don't go with us," when he's telling
[30:45] the Lord, if you're not going to go with
[30:47] us and if you're going to destroy the
[30:49] people, you're going to have to come
[30:50] through me
[30:53] because a desire of of him knowing God
[30:55] and the fellowship goes and him wanting
[30:58] Israel to have that same thing. It's the
[31:01] spirit of Christ in you actually seeking
[31:04] God. And that's that's a promise that he
[31:08] gives us.
[31:11] 2 Chronicles 15:15.
[31:16] And all Judah rejoiced at the oath, for
[31:19] they had sworn with their heart and
[31:21] sought him with their whole desire, and
[31:24] he was found of them, and the Lord gave
[31:27] them rest roundout.
[31:32] When you seek the Lord and you find God
[31:34] and you fellowship, the blessings that
[31:37] come with it,
[31:39] the fellowship, the peace, the rest,
[31:43] even if if if everything around you
[31:46] seems to be going upside down and
[31:48] backwards, knowing that God is there
[31:50] with you, there's a peace and a rest.
[31:54] He's never failed, and he's not going to
[31:57] start fighting failing today. He's the
[32:00] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[32:04] 1 Chronicles 16:10 and 11.
[32:09] Glory ye in his holy name. Let the heart
[32:12] of their of them rejoice that seek the
[32:16] Lord. Seek the Lord and his strength.
[32:19] Seek his face continually.
[32:23] Now, it's easy to to prepare for a
[32:26] Wednesday night service, Sunday morning
[32:28] service, Sunday evening service,
[32:30] but God likes a Monday service, a
[32:32] Tuesday service, a Wednesday service, a
[32:35] Thursday service, a Friday service.
[32:38] You know, I um I got a text from
[32:42] Stephen, my son-in-law, letting me know
[32:44] that our supervisor that I had worked
[32:47] under quite some time for quite a few
[32:49] years. We went back from probably the
[32:52] mid 90s back, I guess, that he would be
[32:55] retiring next month.
[32:57] So, I sent him a text. I said, "I hear
[32:59] hear you're retiring." We got to talking
[33:01] a little bit. So, he asked me, we're
[33:03] kind of texting. He said, "What's it
[33:05] like?" I said, "Well, the hardest time
[33:08] thing for me right now is figuring out
[33:09] what day it is.
[33:12] First day of the week is Saturday. The
[33:13] second day of the week is Saturday. The
[33:15] third day of the week is Wednesday. And
[33:17] then it's Saturday, Saturday, Saturday,
[33:19] and Sunday."
[33:21] He goes, "What do you mean?" I said,
[33:22] "Well, I go to church on Wednesdays and
[33:24] Sundays. Those two days I know where
[33:25] they are. The other days I have to look
[33:28] at the calendar
[33:31] because it's You understand what I'm
[33:33] saying? It it it's not it's not a
[33:36] Wednesday Sunday with God. It's every
[33:39] day.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; He'll meet with us here,
[33:43] &gt;&gt; but he loves to have fellowship every
[33:45] day.
[33:46] In the morning when I rise,
[33:50] during the day, in the cool of the
[33:52] evening, and at night before I go to
[33:54] bed, I fellowship with him.
[34:00] Psalms 9:10.
[34:05] And they that know thy name will put
[34:07] their trust in thee. For thou, oh Lord,
[34:11] has not forsaken them that seek thee,
[34:14] he'll never turn his back on you.
[34:18] Even when things, let me just put it,
[34:21] even when you do didn't do it right,
[34:23] even when you failed, even when you made
[34:25] a mistake,
[34:27] even when you threw your hands up and
[34:28] said, "I quit." He'll never forsake you.
[34:33] There are many times we get to that
[34:35] point where we just feel like throwing
[34:36] our hands up in the air and say, "I
[34:38] don't want to do this anymore."
[34:41] Psalms 27:4
[34:44] and 7 and 8.
[34:46] One thing have I desired of the Lord,
[34:49] that will I seek after, that I may dwell
[34:52] in the house of the Lord all the days of
[34:54] my life, to behold the beauty of the
[34:57] Lord and to inquire in his temple. He
[35:00] says, "All the days of my life,
[35:05] not just in the morning a little bit,
[35:08] not all the time seeking the Lord. Can
[35:12] you do work and seek the Lord?" Yes, you
[35:14] can. Can you drive down the road on your
[35:17] car and seek the Lord? Yes, you can.
[35:21] God is not limited to a specific spot or
[35:24] a specific place.
[35:27] I I I remember that the last part of of
[35:31] work for me was a lot of driving time,
[35:32] crisscrossing town, doing things. And
[35:35] sometimes it was a 45 minute, let's say
[35:37] if I was going from my house to Benson,
[35:38] it was a little over an hour's drive.
[35:41] There was a good hour to talk to the
[35:43] Lord,
[35:44] with my eyes open. I promise.
[35:47] And I never did drive down the road
[35:49] praying with my eyes closed. But God
[35:51] answered. God spoke back. It was
[35:54] fellowship.
[35:56] No, you know, so he says,
[36:01] "One thing have I desired, and that will
[36:03] I seek, that I may dwell in the house of
[36:05] the Lord all the days of my life, to
[36:07] behold the beauty of the Lord, and to
[36:10] inquire in his temple.
[36:13] Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice,
[36:15] have mercy also upon me, and answer me."
[36:20] And when thou saidest, seek ye my face,
[36:23] my heart said unto thee, thy face, Lord,
[36:26] will I seek.
[36:29] And it's it's not um God doesn't ask a a
[36:34] certain set of rules to approach him.
[36:37] You got to meet this, got to meet this,
[36:40] you got to go that, you got to do this,
[36:41] you got to wash. He did the priest. He
[36:43] had to wash their hands. He had there
[36:44] was so many rituals that they went
[36:46] through to get to that point. But God
[36:49] says just turn your heart back towards
[36:51] me
[36:52] &gt;&gt; and I will be there with you.
[36:56] And then Isaiah 55
[36:59] 6-9.
[37:02] Seek ye the Lord while he may be found.
[37:05] Call ye upon him while he is near.
[37:08] Let the wicked forsake his way and the
[37:11] righteous unrighteous man his thoughts.
[37:15] and let him return unto the Lord, and he
[37:17] will have mercy upon him, and to our
[37:20] God, who will abundantly pardon,
[37:25] who will abundantly pardon. And he says,
[37:29] "For my thoughts are not your thoughts."
[37:32] And I appreciate that,
[37:34] that his thoughts are pure and true, and
[37:37] he keeps his word.
[37:40] Neither are your ways my ways, sayaeth
[37:42] the Lord.
[37:45] But he can be touched by the filling of
[37:47] our infirmities.
[37:50] I've been there. I've been attacked that
[37:52] way. I was tempted that way. But I
[37:54] overcame and you can overcome. He says,
[38:00] "For as the heavens are higher than the
[38:03] earth, so are my ways higher than your
[38:06] ways and my thoughts than your
[38:08] thoughts." And I'm glad because if he
[38:11] thought sometimes the way I think, I'd
[38:14] be very disappointed in him
[38:16] because I sure get disappointed in
[38:18] myself sometimes.
[38:20] But he has it all under his control.
[38:23] He's not He's not pushed and pulled this
[38:25] way. How do I do now? What I do? He's
[38:27] It's already taken care of.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; David cries out, "Though I walk through
[38:33] the valley of the shadow of death, I
[38:35] will fear no evil."
[38:37] &gt;&gt; How do you get to a place like that?
[38:39] when you've walked through that valley
[38:40] and you've overcome.
[38:42] When you've gone through that hard time
[38:44] and you've overcome or when you hear the
[38:46] testimony of someone sharing and you see
[38:48] the joy in their life, the blessing of
[38:50] it, it encourages you. You know,
[38:54] somebody gives their testimony of the
[38:55] goodness of God. It's a blessing every
[38:57] time. You know, and maybe we do get a
[39:00] little bit of jealous. Lord, I'd like
[39:01] that blessing, too. And then says, okay,
[39:04] I'm going to put you through that. And
[39:05] say, well, I don't know, Lord. Can I do
[39:07] that? Well, you ask for that blessing.
[39:09] You get that blessing by going through
[39:11] that trial. Wow.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Okay. He know he knows how to bring his
[39:16] children up. You know, raising six
[39:19] daughters. And I see Abby there and
[39:21] looks like Dena and Sarah.
[39:23] And they're all six daughters, but each
[39:27] one had a little different nature about
[39:30] them, a little different way about them.
[39:32] Some things was in general, but some
[39:34] things were individual.
[39:37] you know how and that's the way the Lord
[39:39] is. He might deal with brother Jonathan
[39:41] a certain way and sister Lily a certain
[39:43] way, but then there are some things that
[39:45] we all hear, but God knows how to deal
[39:47] with you, how to talk to you,
[39:50] you know. So,
[39:52] I like this
[39:55] Jeremiah 29
[39:58] uh
[39:59] there 29 11 through13. For I know the
[40:02] thoughts that I think toward you, saith
[40:06] the Lord.
[40:08] Oh, you know the thoughts that you think
[40:11] towards me. You also know the thoughts
[40:13] that I think towards you.
[40:16] And sometimes that's a little scary.
[40:19] Say, Lord, help me. But watch what he
[40:22] says. Thoughts of peace and not of evil
[40:25] to give you an expected end. That which
[40:28] I have purposed is what's going to
[40:31] happen.
[40:33] Not let's but to just just think that I
[40:37] know the thoughts that I think towards
[40:39] you sayeth the Lord not of evil but of
[40:42] good.
[40:43] Then shall you call upon me and you
[40:45] shall go and pray unto me and I will
[40:48] hearken. I will listen. I will pay
[40:50] attention to you and you shall seek me
[40:54] and find me when you shall search for me
[40:59] with all your heart.
[41:02] And searching for God with all your
[41:05] heart requires an effort
[41:09] because we get pulled in a lot of
[41:11] different directions, a lot of different
[41:13] things. But giving your all your heart
[41:17] when when you're talking to him and
[41:19] setting everything else aside and be
[41:22] willing to say, "Lord, whatever it
[41:24] takes,
[41:26] deal with me. If it's there something
[41:29] wrong, show it to me. Help me. Show me
[41:31] to make it how to make it right. Show me
[41:32] how to fix that. And then Lord, you're
[41:35] going to have to show me again because I
[41:36] didn't learn my lesson the first time.
[41:38] Help me the second time.
[41:42] And to God, when he's forgiven it and
[41:44] cleaned it, it's the first time again.
[41:48] That's hard to understand sometimes.
[41:51] But you get before him the father, I I
[41:53] made a mistake again. And he looks and
[41:55] shows you his book and he says, there's
[41:57] nothing there. It's already been
[42:00] cleaned.
[42:02] It's us that struggle with that part.
[42:08] Now in the in in in in the New Testament
[42:11] when Jesus was here on earth and and he
[42:15] walked with his disciples and and we are
[42:18] fortunate to have everything that has
[42:21] been recorded in the scriptures
[42:24] and in today with everything they have
[42:26] found there's so many things that they
[42:27] have found and discovered that back that
[42:30] that that show those things really did
[42:33] happen. it was not somebody's
[42:34] imagination. But even more than that is
[42:38] when you have those same experiences
[42:40] that they had in here, then it really
[42:43] becomes real to you. God cares for me.
[42:47] God knows what I'm doing, where why I'm
[42:49] here, and what he's doing about it.
[42:53] Matthew 6:33,
[42:56] "But seek ye first the kingdom of God
[43:00] and his righteousness,
[43:02] and then all these things will be added
[43:05] unto you,
[43:07] seeking him first."
[43:10] Um,
[43:12] a lot of times and and we've all done
[43:13] it,
[43:15] you know, as as the the girls were
[43:17] growing up and and as my grandchildren
[43:20] are here as they're growing up, I've
[43:22] watched them try to do it themselves and
[43:24] they want to, you know, and mama can
[43:27] tell you more about that. And then they
[43:29] finally have to come in and said, "Can
[43:31] you help me?"
[43:33] And sometimes we're trying to do it
[43:35] ourselves.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; She doesn't ask you if you can help her.
[43:40] I saw sister Angela and her kind of
[43:42] laughing. But you know, there comes a
[43:44] time that we have to say, "Help, I
[43:46] surrender. I need help, you know, and it
[43:49] said, but he says, seek ye first the
[43:51] kingdom of God." And he repeats this in
[43:54] the in the gospels and his
[43:56] righteousness, and all these things
[43:57] shall be added unto you. And then in
[43:59] Luke 12:31-32,
[44:01] he says, "But rather seek ye the kingdom
[44:03] of God, and all these things shall be
[44:05] added unto you. Fear not, little flock,
[44:08] for it's your father's good pleasure to
[44:10] give you the kingdom.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; The joy that we you have as as a father,
[44:17] as a parent, or maybe even an older
[44:19] brother to a younger brother or to a
[44:21] good friend of being able to give
[44:23] something and help with them, you know,
[44:25] just to see them, you know, and and then
[44:28] also the joy, especially now with the
[44:30] with Khloe and Ashers. Thank you, Papa,
[44:33] you know, it just means something to
[44:35] you. And when he has done for you and
[44:37] you realize what he's done for you, you
[44:38] run and say, "Lord, I just appreciate
[44:40] your goodness,
[44:43] even though I've walked through the
[44:44] valley of shadow of death, I will fear
[44:46] no evil," David said, because thou art
[44:48] with me, and I don't have to. I may
[44:52] fall, I may trip, I may make a mistake,
[44:54] but you said you'd watch over me.
[44:59] Fear not, little flock, for it's for
[45:00] it's your father's good pleasure to give
[45:03] you the kingdom.
[45:05] Matthew chapter 7
[45:08] verses 7 and 8. Ask and it shall be
[45:13] given you. Ask
[45:18] Lord.
[45:21] You're you're you're such a great God.
[45:22] You're you're you're so powerful. You're
[45:24] so righteous. You're so holy. You're so
[45:27] And you describe who he is. And I'm
[45:30] nothing.
[45:33] But I haven't found anywhere that the
[45:35] scripture says that the only way I can
[45:36] talk to him is when I match him. I never
[45:39] could talk to him then.
[45:42] But he says,
[45:44] "Ask and it shall be be given you. Seek
[45:48] and you shall find. Knock and it shall
[45:51] be open unto you."
[45:55] You know,
[45:58] he said, "That's enough to get my
[46:00] attention.
[46:02] How do you not? Get on your knees. Said,
[46:05] 'Lord, I want to talk with you. Lord, I
[46:08] want to have some fellowship with you.
[46:10] Maybe when you're driving down the road,
[46:12] Lord, while I'm driving down the road, I
[46:14] want to hear from you.
[46:17] It doesn't have to be and and I know we
[46:19] all set a a place aside sometimes and
[46:21] and I know some places that I go to pray
[46:25] when I set my my time aside, it's
[46:28] specifically right there that I am going
[46:30] to seek the Lord. I set that aside, that
[46:33] time or that place. But if I'm driving
[46:35] down the highway, I could still talk to
[46:38] him.
[46:39] If I'm up in the mountains, I can still
[46:42] talk to him.
[46:45] If I was in prison, I could still talk
[46:48] to him. He'll watch over you.
[46:54] So again, in Matthew, ask and it shall
[46:57] be given you. Seek and you shall find.
[47:00] Knock and it shall be open. Then he
[47:02] answers it. For everyone that seeketh or
[47:04] askketh receiveth,
[47:07] and he that seeketh findeth, and to him
[47:10] that knockketh it shall be opened.
[47:15] So
[47:16] just say, "Brother Josiah came to my
[47:18] house to visit me or looking for me,"
[47:21] which he hasn't yet, but maybe one of
[47:23] these days he will. And he stands, but
[47:26] he didn't tell me he was coming. and he
[47:29] stands outside of my front door and he
[47:31] just stands there,
[47:34] but I don't know he's coming. I'm not
[47:37] expecting him.
[47:39] And he doesn't knock and he doesn't ring
[47:41] the bell and he doesn't call me on the
[47:43] phone. I don't know that brother
[47:45] Josiah's out there unless I happen to
[47:47] look out. And then I'll ask him, "Why
[47:50] didn't you knock? Why didn't you call?
[47:53] Why didn't you ring the the doorbell?"
[47:55] Well, I'm afraid I was going to disturb
[47:57] you. Well, then why did you come?
[48:02] Sometimes we do that with the Lord.
[48:04] We're just on our knees, but we're not
[48:06] even asking or talking to him. Just on
[48:08] our knees. But he says, "Ring the
[48:11] doorbell. Call. I'm here for you." Says,
[48:15] "He that knockketh, it shall be open."
[48:18] And so, Brother Josiah,
[48:21] I'll expect a knock or a doorbell or a
[48:24] call ahead. Okay, we know that just
[48:28] you'll remember something like that.
[48:30] It's that simple.
[48:32] I've got to pray for 10 hours. I've got
[48:34] to read my Bible. I got to hear five
[48:36] messages. I got to listen to this
[48:38] preacher before I can get to God. No,
[48:40] you can get on your knees and talk to
[48:41] him.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; Wherever you at, wherever you find
[48:46] yourself, you can talk to him.
[48:51] Matthew 6:19-21.
[48:56] Lay not up for yourself treasures upon
[48:59] the earth.
[49:01] Where moth and dust rust doth corrupt
[49:04] and where thieves break through and
[49:06] steal. And if you watch anything in the
[49:08] news, it's just rampant today. Breaking
[49:12] in here, stealing, that making all the
[49:15] young guys running in and just breaking
[49:17] into a store and stealing stuff. just
[49:19] wide open today.
[49:21] And he says, "That's not where your
[49:23] treasure should be at. That's not where
[49:24] your heart should be at." He says, "But
[49:27] lay up for yourselves treasures in
[49:29] heaven where neither moth nor rust does
[49:32] corrupt, and where thieves do not break
[49:35] through nor steal."
[49:38] Now, does that mean a physical place in
[49:40] in heaven? No. That's between you and
[49:41] God.
[49:43] There will come a time where we will be
[49:45] on that side, but right now, I'm not
[49:47] there. But there's a place that I can
[49:49] get to where it's just me and him.
[49:52] And he says, "That's where you should
[49:54] lay that. For where your treasure is,
[49:57] there will your heart be also."
[50:02] I remember my dad.
[50:04] Um
[50:06] many years ago, he had bought a brand
[50:08] new truck in 1964,
[50:10] a Chevy pickup, and it was a Cardinal
[50:13] red. And he would say, "We're going to
[50:16] the park." And there he would drive us
[50:18] to the park and he would take a a bucket
[50:20] of water and he would wash the truck and
[50:23] shine the truck, clean it all up and
[50:26] keep it nice, everything. He treasured
[50:29] that truck. I mean, it it was always
[50:32] clean. It was always nice. And he let us
[50:35] get in it and go with him, which was a
[50:37] good thing, too. Sometimes people clean
[50:38] it up and don't let nobody touch it. But
[50:41] he, you know, and you know,
[50:44] God will clean you up and and wash you
[50:47] up because he wants to abide with you.
[50:51] He wants to be with you. He wants to go.
[50:53] He wants to fellowship with you. And I I
[50:55] still remember that. Now before we moved
[50:59] to to um Tucson in in 76
[51:05] um 75 actually dad had promised to sell
[51:09] the truck to a friend of his and he did
[51:12] the man bought it. It was not no longer
[51:14] not my dad's truck.
[51:17] But I remember my dad would get so
[51:19] aggravated when he would see his friend
[51:22] driving down the road and the truck
[51:23] wasn't clean and he was racing it up and
[51:27] down the road and it would make my dad
[51:28] so mad. But it was no longer my dad's
[51:31] truck.
[51:33] Satan will get angry at you and
[51:36] frustrated with you and wants to make a
[51:37] mess out of you, but you're not his
[51:40] anymore. You belong to God.
[51:44] He lost to one who has given his heart.
[51:47] He wants to make a mess out of you. But
[51:50] God says, "No, he's mine. I'll clean him
[51:53] up. I'll change your life. I'll do this
[51:55] work on him." He says, "Because where
[51:58] your treasure is, there will your heart
[52:00] be also. And when you're God's treasure,
[52:02] his heart was for you. And he gave his
[52:04] life for you." He said, "They can't do
[52:07] it on their own. I'm going to be there
[52:09] with them."
[52:11] Matthew 6:25-32
[52:19] I say unto you, take no thought for your
[52:22] life, what you shall eat, or what you
[52:25] shall drink, nor yet for your body, what
[52:28] you shall put on. Is not the life more
[52:31] than meat and the body than reignment?
[52:36] Jesus is saying okay you have to these
[52:38] are things that we have to do to to you
[52:41] know to be on this earth and all but
[52:43] when that becomes our priority he said
[52:45] there's a greater priority than that
[52:48] there's something there he says behold
[52:51] the fowls of the air they don't sow they
[52:54] sow not neither do they reap nor gather
[52:57] into barns yet your heavenly father
[53:00] feedth them are ye not much better than
[53:03] they
[53:04] I looked at that and it just in reading
[53:06] that we have u in the backyard we got
[53:09] two uh uh goodsized trees out there and
[53:13] we have all the birds out there and
[53:16] the bird take person takes care of the
[53:18] birds out there. My wife is constantly
[53:21] putting food out there for them, making
[53:23] sure the water's full. And now the
[53:25] rabbits have found out that she puts the
[53:28] some of the vegetables that are getting
[53:29] old, they get up and put out there. And
[53:32] and she just enjoys watching them do it.
[53:37] Now, it's for them.
[53:41] And
[53:43] some of those rabbits think it's just
[53:46] for them. They fight each other for
[53:49] what's there even though there's 10
[53:51] pieces there,
[53:53] you know, just watching in the nature.
[53:55] We get we get out and watch them. And
[53:57] now there's two hawks that decided that
[54:00] that's a good place to hang around now
[54:02] because there's plenty of food out
[54:03] there.
[54:05] And uh she doesn't like it at all. My
[54:09] wife,
[54:10] go away, hawks. Those are my rabbits.
[54:12] Those are my birds. Those are my
[54:14] squirrel.
[54:15] We're getting a whole extra of us, you
[54:18] know. But you know, when when God
[54:24] takes care of them, how much more do you
[54:28] mean to him?
[54:31] And when Satan comes around and begins
[54:33] to argue and fight for you, God said,
[54:35] "No, those aren't mine.
[54:38] I died for them. I gave my life for
[54:41] them." Yeah, but look at this one, what
[54:43] he did. Look at this one what she did.
[54:45] Look what he says, I know, and that's
[54:47] why I died for him and shed my blood.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; He says, and he tells him, are ye not
[54:53] much better than they? Then he says,
[54:55] which of you by taking thought can add
[54:57] one cubit unto his stature? In other
[55:00] words, how can you uh get all caught up
[55:03] in your mind, get all frustrated with
[55:05] us, doing all this, and increase
[55:06] yourself? You can't. You need to learn
[55:09] to rest
[55:11] and and let him do the work.
[55:15] It's it's one of those things that
[55:18] if um
[55:21] I'll just you sister Lily Sister Katie
[55:23] on the piano, they make it look so easy.
[55:28] I've tried it. It never sounds anything
[55:31] like that. I can do one finger. If I try
[55:35] two, they get lost.
[55:37] Now, I don't know if Sister Katie or
[55:41] it could play the saxophone. I can play
[55:43] the saxophone. I have my part. She has
[55:46] her place.
[55:48] But God will fit you where you're needed
[55:50] to be.
[55:52] What you need to do, the part of the
[55:55] body you're part of. He says, "Take no
[55:57] thought,
[55:59] but which of you by taking thought can
[56:02] add one cubit unto your stature? And why
[56:04] take ye thought for reignment? Consider
[56:07] the liies of the field not how they
[56:10] grow. They toil not, neither do they
[56:13] spin. There's no that little flower
[56:15] doesn't come out, dig the ground around,
[56:17] go grab the hose and water itself. No,
[56:20] the seed is there and my wife goes out
[56:23] there and gets a hose and puts the water
[56:24] down or God sends the rain along and
[56:27] they grow.
[56:31] And then he says,
[56:35] "And yet I say unto you," this is Jesus
[56:37] speaking, "that even Solomon in all his
[56:40] glory was not arrayed like one of
[56:43] these."
[56:45] sometimes going down I know when we were
[56:47] up in Idaho and and those places just to
[56:50] see the fields covered in grain
[56:53] and in in wheat or whatever they were
[56:55] growing and other places and just when
[56:57] we went back to the Midwest to see the
[56:59] corn that was about 10 ft high
[57:03] I'd never seen didn't realize corn could
[57:05] get up that high but just to see those
[57:07] things God takes care of all of that
[57:11] he's made a way and he'll take care of
[57:14] you
[57:16] if you'll let him do it.
[57:19] And he says, "Where wherefore if God
[57:21] clothe the grass clothe the grass of the
[57:24] field which today is and tomorrow is
[57:26] cast in the oven, shall he not much more
[57:30] clothe ye? Oh ye of little faith,
[57:35] I I looked at that. Oh, ye of little
[57:38] faith. Lord, yesterday it was you did
[57:40] such a wonderful thing for me, but Lord,
[57:43] where are you today?
[57:46] 15 minutes ago I was praising the Lord.
[57:48] And 15 minutes later, I say, "Where are
[57:50] you? Where did you go?" He's never left
[57:53] you.
[57:55] But he likes to test you. He wants you
[57:58] to also understand that there's a growth
[58:00] possibility, that there's a way to grow
[58:02] up some more in the Lord.
[58:07] And then he says, "Therefore, take no
[58:08] thought, saying, what shall we eat? What
[58:11] shall we drink? Or wherewith all shall
[58:14] we be clothed?
[58:16] For after all these things do the
[58:19] Gentiles seek.
[58:21] For your heavenly Father knoweth that
[58:23] you have need of all these things."
[58:28] He knows he's already made provision in
[58:31] the natural and in the spiritual. You
[58:35] know, it's it's sometimes we get a
[58:37] little bit frustrated
[58:39] because we want things to happen quicker
[58:42] and faster. Um
[58:46] it's a little different here in uh in
[58:48] the summer
[58:50] because boy, you really have to water
[58:52] everything that's planted outside. You
[58:53] really got to watch the shade in the
[58:55] water because it'll get eaten up in no
[58:57] time.
[58:58] you know, and and there's other places
[59:00] in this country that it just seems like
[59:02] they all that stuff just grows up
[59:03] without without any help. It seems I've
[59:06] talked to enough folks that they say, "I
[59:08] love Arizona from about late October
[59:12] till about March or April, but I do not
[59:14] want to be here in the summer." Well,
[59:17] sometimes I feel the same way, too. But
[59:19] God has his reasons and his wise,
[59:22] you know, but God has made a provision.
[59:27] God has made a way.
[59:32] Okay? He said, "I'll never leave you.
[59:34] I'll never forsake you."
[59:37] But he didn't say you wouldn't go
[59:39] through any problems. He never said that
[59:41] you wouldn't have some downtimes. He
[59:43] just said, "I'll be with you and I'll
[59:45] never leave you."
[59:48] Our lessons learned are what we go
[59:51] through, what we learn from. Eventually,
[59:54] you learn
[59:56] hopefully not to touch touch a hot pan.
[1:00:00] Hopefully, it doesn't take 15 or 20
[1:00:02] times to learn something like that
[1:00:04] because it hurts.
[1:00:06] Some lessons need to be learned quickly
[1:00:09] so you don't injure yourself. Some
[1:00:11] lessons take time. There's uh brother
[1:00:15] Sean here who who's a pilot on a what
[1:00:17] 767 I believe he said. you know, um,
[1:00:22] they just called you up one day while
[1:00:23] you were at home and asked you if you
[1:00:24] wanted to fly an airplane, right? Okay.
[1:00:27] Well, don't ever go on that airplane
[1:00:28] then with him. No, there was lessons.
[1:00:31] There was learning. He was uh in the
[1:00:33] National Guard, learned to fly. It took
[1:00:35] time, but today he gets on a plane.
[1:00:39] I hope he gets on the plane anyways.
[1:00:41] He's supposed to be flying it. But no,
[1:00:44] there is lessons learned. You can, you
[1:00:46] know, I don't I I don't know. It's just
[1:00:48] a freight, right? you guys just haul
[1:00:50] freight. So, not too worried too much
[1:00:52] about it. They don't doesn't freight
[1:00:54] doesn't complain too much. But, you
[1:00:57] know, but it's a lesson learned. And I
[1:01:01] and I've shared this. Just because
[1:01:03] you've been around something all day
[1:01:05] long or all your life doesn't mean you
[1:01:07] know how to operate it.
[1:01:10] I there was a young man that we hired
[1:01:13] and they asked me to teach him in the
[1:01:16] laminate shop working with laminate and
[1:01:18] solid surfaces and stuff. And my
[1:01:21] question was to him is uh what have you
[1:01:24] done with this
[1:01:26] in in this you know any of this type of
[1:01:28] work and he just shared with me how his
[1:01:30] grandpa had a shop and how his dad
[1:01:31] worked in it and we went around for 5 to
[1:01:35] 10 minutes and I said he doesn't get it.
[1:01:38] I want to know what do you know? I'm not
[1:01:41] hiring your dad and I'm not hiring your
[1:01:43] grandpa. I'm hiring you. And then I
[1:01:46] remembered and the musicians can can
[1:01:47] make their way up now. And I I remember
[1:01:50] just thinking about this and I said, you
[1:01:52] know,
[1:01:54] my dad used to take us over to the
[1:01:55] airport there in Ontario and buy us an
[1:01:57] ice cream and my younger brother and we
[1:01:59] would watch airplanes land and take off
[1:02:03] and we had a great time doing that,
[1:02:04] especially with the ice cream, too. you
[1:02:06] know, we were just kids, watch them take
[1:02:08] off. And then we moved to Tucson and I
[1:02:11] had bought a camera and I used to go
[1:02:13] take pictures. I love to be I loved
[1:02:14] airplanes, just never never had one,
[1:02:16] never flew one myself, but I used to
[1:02:18] like to be around them.
[1:02:20] And then
[1:02:22] a company that I worked for, uh, the
[1:02:25] photographer
[1:02:27] and, um, from the company I was learning
[1:02:30] to take picture stuff. So he used me as
[1:02:34] the model of the as a person that was
[1:02:37] standing there that you can operate this
[1:02:39] machinery if you go through our system.
[1:02:44] And one was sitting in a LAR jet.
[1:02:47] Another one was up on a giant
[1:02:49] lithography machine. Um there was three
[1:02:52] or four things that I had no clue how to
[1:02:55] use, but they just wanted to show
[1:02:58] somebody.
[1:03:00] So, I told this young man, I just said,
[1:03:02] "You know, I've loved airplanes all my
[1:03:05] life. I've been around them. I worked
[1:03:08] for one company and I used to clean the
[1:03:11] owner's lit. I even cleaned the inside.
[1:03:13] I got to sit inside it."
[1:03:16] And I went, I've always watched him. I
[1:03:18] said, "You know, I think I could fly
[1:03:20] one. You want to go flying with me
[1:03:22] today?"
[1:03:24] And he goes, "No."
[1:03:27] Why not?
[1:03:30] probably valued his life,
[1:03:32] but I he goes, "I've never done this
[1:03:36] before." I said, "Thank you. Now I know
[1:03:39] where to start you."
[1:03:42] If we're honest before the Lord, Lord,
[1:03:44] I'm struggling with this. I'm having a
[1:03:46] hard time with this.
[1:03:49] Brother Brandham says in and this my
[1:03:52] Christian friends and sinner friends,
[1:03:54] whatever you do, if you believe me to be
[1:03:57] sent from God, you seek the kingdom of
[1:04:00] God just as quick as you can and get
[1:04:03] into it.
[1:04:05] Not be around it all day, not admire
[1:04:08] those who are in the kingdom, but you
[1:04:10] get into the kingdom of God.
[1:04:13] He says, for that's the only safety we
[1:04:16] have today. The world's at the end of
[1:04:17] the age. Only in Christ are you saved.
[1:04:24] He says, "Now all things ought to be
[1:04:26] considered prayerally. Seek ye first the
[1:04:29] kingdom of God and his righteousness,
[1:04:32] and all these other things will be
[1:04:34] added." I am positive sure this morning
[1:04:36] if men and women could only get into the
[1:04:38] position of where their soul, their
[1:04:41] thinking, their attitude will be perfect
[1:04:43] in the sight of God, that would be one
[1:04:46] of the most powerful churches that ever
[1:04:48] existed.
[1:04:51] [Music]
[1:04:52] You know what it just it's me and you.
[1:04:54] He's saying you and I get into that
[1:04:56] place.
[1:04:58] Uh yeah, but I fail. Yes, we know we
[1:05:00] fail, but God is merciful. and he said,
[1:05:03] "Come back in. Come up. Spend some more
[1:05:07] time with me. Learn the lesson again.
[1:05:10] Get get uh stronger in it. Um you're
[1:05:13] past the first chapter. Let's get into
[1:05:15] the second chapter now. Let's get to the
[1:05:17] end of the book. Let's learn from it."
[1:05:19] So
[1:05:22] if God said so, God keeps his word. He
[1:05:25] has never failed.
[1:05:30] And I would say, Lord, let that be my
[1:05:32] heart's desire. I want to I want to come
[1:05:36] to that place where I would hear the
[1:05:39] same voice. Speak to that storm. I'm
[1:05:41] having fellowship with you. Come on,
[1:05:43] stay here.
[1:05:45] He goes, cuz I want to talk with you.
[1:05:49] Shut him
[1:05:52] with God
[1:05:55] in a secret
[1:05:58] place.
[1:06:00] There in the spirit
[1:06:05] beholding
[1:06:07] his face.
[1:06:10] Gaining
[1:06:12] new power
[1:06:15] to run in the race.
[1:06:20] Oh, I long
[1:06:22] to be shut
[1:06:25] with God. Just one more time.
[1:06:29] shut in
[1:06:32] with God
[1:06:34] in a secret
[1:06:37] way.
[1:06:40] There in the spirit
[1:06:44] beholding
[1:06:47] his face
[1:06:49] gain a new power
[1:06:54] to run in the race.
[1:06:59] Oh, I long
[1:07:01] to be shine
[1:07:04] with God.
[1:07:07] [Music]
[1:07:08] How do we get shut in with you, Lord?
[1:07:12] How do we get to that place where we're
[1:07:15] not afraid
[1:07:17] to enter that with you?
[1:07:21] When there's such a fellowship, when
[1:07:23] there's such a
[1:07:26] that character, that nature becomes to
[1:07:28] the same
[1:07:31] and it's your desire to to to be with us
[1:07:34] as we desire to be with you, Lord.
[1:07:38] And it becomes evident in in in
[1:07:41] what we're doing and how we're acting
[1:07:43] and what we're saying, Lord. It is it
[1:07:45] pleases you, Lord.
[1:07:48] Not anything we could do of ourselves,
[1:07:50] Lord. Not any way we could save
[1:07:52] ourselves, Lord, but just to draw close
[1:07:55] to you, Lord.
[1:07:57] And you would say,
[1:08:00] just speak that storm away. We're having
[1:08:02] fellowship now. That trouble that came
[1:08:05] your way, just speak to it and say, I'm
[1:08:08] having fellowship with my savior. You go
[1:08:10] away,
[1:08:12] Lord. We It's sometimes we make it too
[1:08:14] difficult. Sometimes we make the only
[1:08:16] way God will listen to me is if I prayed
[1:08:18] for 24 hours straight,
[1:08:21] but if we'll just call on you, Lord, you
[1:08:24] will answer and you'll draw nigh to us,
[1:08:26] Lord.
[1:08:28] Lord, let us take take it full advantage
[1:08:30] of that, Lord.
[1:08:32] And when someone would see, they would
[1:08:35] see Christ in us and then they would
[1:08:37] ask, "How can I have that same Christ
[1:08:40] that's in you?" And then we could share
[1:08:42] our experience with them.
[1:08:44] and be just like Peter said, "Such as I
[1:08:48] have, I give unto you." In the name of
[1:08:51] the Lord Jesus Christ, rise up and walk,
[1:08:53] Lord. We pray in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:08:57] Amen.
[1:09:00] [Music]
[1:09:06] Could you all stand?
[1:09:10] Brother Aaron asked that we'd sing
[1:09:11] Psalms 34. Before
[1:09:16] we leave,
[1:09:18] it's not cliche, but let's just not let
