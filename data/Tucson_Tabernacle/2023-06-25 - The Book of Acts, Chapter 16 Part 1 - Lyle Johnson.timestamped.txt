[24:38] mother-in-law wrote this song and when
[24:40] she sang it it just
[24:42] just resonated with me and has kind of
[24:45] become a little prayer for me and I love
[24:47] songs that are like prayers

[40:58] good evening
[41:01] our purpose this evening is to continue
[41:04] our study in the book of Acts tonight
[41:06] we'll consider chapter 16. I was going
[41:09] to do the whole chapter but
[41:12] I realize that Paul and Silas sang at
[41:14] midnight I didn't want to keep you that
[41:16] warm
[41:17] so we're just going to do the first part
[41:19] of Acts tonight and God willing
[41:21] Wednesday night will do the second part
[41:25] so having said that let's get started
[41:27] but before we open our Bibles let's pray
[41:30] once more
[41:32] Lord Jesus
[41:34] we count it such an honor
[41:36] it's such a privilege that we can stand
[41:39] here in this day
[41:40] that we can open your word
[41:43] and freely read it
[41:45] and that Lord your spirit can be present
[41:48] to help us not just understand it
[41:50] but to apply it in our lives lord it's
[41:53] not just history it's not just this or
[41:56] that it's not tales that we're made up
[41:59] but lord it's there for our instruction
[42:01] our reproof our growth Lord to help us
[42:04] draw closer to you
[42:06] and we know that we draw closer to you
[42:08] when we draw closer to one another
[42:09] because you said that by this will all
[42:12] men know that you're my disciples Lord I
[42:15] pray that you would help me Lord to just
[42:17] get my thoughts out of the way Lord I
[42:20] get so many ideas and things but Lord
[42:23] that it just be your thoughts the words
[42:26] that you want spoken this evening and
[42:28] Lord if I misstate something let
[42:30] everyone that hears it hear it the way
[42:32] that it's intended hear it the way that
[42:34] you want it to be heard Lord we commit
[42:37] the remainder of this service into your
[42:38] hands and again we thank you for this
[42:41] awesome privilege in the name of our
[42:43] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[42:45] amen
[42:49] acts 16 is the start of what we commonly
[42:53] refer to as Paul's second missionary
[42:56] journey
[42:57] but that Journey really starts in Acts
[42:59] 15 starting at the 36th verse as brother
[43:02] Daniel shared last Wednesday evening
[43:04] acts 15 is primarily about a conflict an
[43:08] argument over Doctrine and how do we
[43:10] apply this and and what's going on here
[43:12] anyway
[43:14] it's about if and how to apply a portion
[43:17] of the Bible of their day what we call
[43:19] the Old Testament to Gentile converts to
[43:23] christianities Christianity was
[43:25] considered a branch or a sect of Judaism
[43:29] so the question becomes so our new
[43:32] Gentile Believers required to become
[43:34] Jewish in order to become Christians
[43:37] if so why
[43:39] if not why not
[43:42] and if not are there any basic
[43:45] foundational rules that they were
[43:47] required to observe other than
[43:49] acceptance of Jesus as their savior
[43:53] well bleach we review this this evening
[43:55] but let's start our study with Acts 15.
[43:58] beginning at verse 36.
[44:01] after some days now we learned in Acts
[44:04] 15 about this letter from Jerusalem and
[44:06] after some days after this had been
[44:07] settled
[44:09] realizing that these doctrines and the
[44:11] people that were spreading them didn't
[44:12] just go to Antioch but they might have
[44:14] gone to other places and got things
[44:16] stirred up
[44:17] so Paul turned to Barnabas the fellow
[44:20] that he had traveled with for a couple
[44:22] of years not too long before this and
[44:25] said let's go again
[44:27] visit our brethren in every city
[44:30] every city where we have preached the
[44:34] word of the Lord and see how they do
[44:37] in other words barnabasas let's retrace
[44:40] our journey let's make sure that all is
[44:43] well
[44:44] and Barnabas agreed
[44:47] his heart was with Paul in this
[44:49] he shared the concerns he wanted the
[44:52] decision of the Jerusalem Council to
[44:55] reach those places as before Barnabas
[44:58] was determined to take with them his
[45:00] relative John
[45:02] whose surname was Mark
[45:06] Paul had a different idea Paul thought
[45:09] it not good to take John Mark with them
[45:12] why why because John Mark was he who had
[45:16] from them on their previous
[45:18] after they completed the work of
[45:20] evangelism across the entire island of
[45:22] Cyprus and sailed to the mainland of
[45:24] what we now call Turkey a town called
[45:26] Italia not Italy but Italia was the name
[45:29] of a port city and
[45:30] John Mark decided that he was going to
[45:32] go home to Jerusalem so he got on a boat
[45:34] went to Jerusalem and Paul and Barnabas
[45:37] then went on to the work in freudia and
[45:40] galatia and so forth and and met a lot
[45:43] of opposition
[45:44] so he didn't go with them and Paul
[45:47] wasn't very happy about that
[45:49] we read that the contention
[45:53] the disagreement
[45:55] the argument
[45:56] the Discord was so sharp between Paul
[46:01] and Barnabas that they departed a Sunder
[46:06] one from the other they separated from
[46:08] each other on this journey
[46:10] the burden of which was to revisit every
[46:13] city
[46:15] so Barnabas took mark
[46:17] and sailed to Cyprus that's where John
[46:20] Mark had worked with them
[46:22] when Barnabas it's where Barnabas was
[46:24] from
[46:25] to see the converts there to share and
[46:28] strengthen and encourage the Christians
[46:30] on the island
[46:31] please be seated
[46:35] there there's a huge point I think to be
[46:39] made right here
[46:41] and I think it's one that's often
[46:43] overlooked maybe one that we don't
[46:45] really realize
[46:47] but if you take home nothing this
[46:50] evening with this please take this home
[46:53] it sometimes pointed out that here in
[46:55] verse 39 that that's the last mention of
[46:58] Barnabas in the book of Acts he's kind
[47:01] of treated dismissively well so long
[47:03] Barnabas thanks a lot but we're moving
[47:05] on too bad for you
[47:08] let me ask you a question
[47:11] do we dismiss Peter from The ongoing
[47:13] work of spreading the gospel
[47:16] put him in the same place that we might
[47:18] put Barnabas
[47:21] no why not
[47:24] Barnabas last mentioned here is acts 15
[47:26] verse 39.
[47:29] it's the end of an argument where Paul
[47:31] and Barnabas are are disagreeing about a
[47:33] traveling companion
[47:35] the last mention of Peter in the book of
[47:38] Acts 32 verses prior to this acts 15
[47:41] verse 7. so if we're going to dismiss
[47:43] Barnabas at verse 39 we need to just
[47:45] miss Peter at verse 7.
[47:48] but we don't do that there's something
[47:49] else going on here
[47:52] we note that most of the Apostles are
[47:54] never mentioned by name
[47:56] what do we know of Bartholomew
[47:58] what about Thomas after his confession
[48:00] that Jesus is Lord what do you know
[48:02] about Simon the Zeller or Matthew or or
[48:05] Thaddeus
[48:08] aren't they among the apostles
[48:10] Yep they're never mentioned by name in
[48:12] the book of Acts
[48:14] this fact of no further mention is not
[48:17] some form of judgment
[48:21] we're told
[48:23] Luke told us Barnabas was a good man
[48:26] that he was filled with the Holy Spirit
[48:29] Paul recognized this he and Barnabas
[48:31] made a good team
[48:33] they stuck together
[48:35] when Paul was going down to Jerusalem
[48:37] after his background in the history of
[48:39] being not very friendly to the church
[48:40] they didn't want to talk to him they
[48:42] were afraid of them Barnabas
[48:44] stood up for him Barnabas made the
[48:46] introduction Barnabas brought them
[48:48] together
[48:50] so does the fact that they had an
[48:52] argument about a traveling companion
[48:55] mean that Barnabas was somehow a bad guy
[48:59] does it mean he was no longer a good man
[49:03] but somehow the Holy Spirit was drained
[49:05] out of him
[49:06] he was useless to the gospel
[49:09] convert to some satanic cult
[49:14] I think that we can be sure that in
[49:16] spite of this disagreement with Paul
[49:18] Barnabas continued the work of spreading
[49:20] the gospel
[49:22] strengthening the communities of
[49:23] Believers in fact on the journey that
[49:26] Paul's now going to take he said he
[49:28] turned to Barnabas and said let's visit
[49:30] every City
[49:33] where we have previously preached
[49:36] so this was the burden that Paul
[49:39] confided to Barnabas
[49:42] and we'll find out Paul didn't go to
[49:44] Cyprus
[49:45] but it wasn't because they were
[49:47] unimportant or dismissive it's because
[49:49] he trusted Barnabas
[49:52] to carry on that burden in the island of
[49:55] Cyprus
[49:57] while he went to the other churches that
[49:59] they had gone to they split the task
[50:02] they didn't divide us under and hate
[50:04] each other and that was the end and they
[50:06] never spoke to each other again they
[50:08] split the task over this disagreement
[50:12] I don't think Paul lost confidence in
[50:14] Barnabas
[50:15] I think that we have to understand that
[50:18] these are true stories these were about
[50:20] real people Paul is not perfect neither
[50:23] is Barnabas neither is John Mark
[50:26] but they have likes and dislikes they
[50:28] have biases they have feelings
[50:32] they have high points and low points
[50:34] arguments
[50:36] pain
[50:37] Pride stubbornness
[50:39] Family Ties
[50:41] they're just like me
[50:44] they're just like me I I can tell you a
[50:48] little personal story here that
[50:50] I I will it's not spiritual but it might
[50:53] help illustrate the point
[50:54] when we're remodeling the house a couple
[50:56] of years ago there was a fellow that
[50:58] came in that was a framer and he and
[51:00] Heather started talking and it turned
[51:02] out that they'd both been involved in
[51:03] some Evangelistic work in Europe in the
[51:05] 1960s when they were kids
[51:08] and this guy knew this other guy that
[51:10] lives in the White Mountains and and
[51:12] cuts down trees and makes stuff and he
[51:15] wanted to go with us to the White
[51:16] Mountains to this guy so he could make
[51:18] these Shaggy Juniper mantels that we
[51:20] have in our house now and I thought yeah
[51:23] I don't want to travel with this guy
[51:25] I felt a little bit like maybe Paul felt
[51:28] about John Mark you know so I I was
[51:31] determined that I'm not going to ride
[51:33] for hours this guy's going to talk my
[51:34] ear off and I can't understand no this
[51:36] is not going to happen so instead we
[51:39] went a few weeks after this we went to
[51:41] Dallas Texas to the funeral of of Alan
[51:45] Hawkinson and then from there we it was
[51:47] it was June and we went up into the
[51:51] white not the White Mountains but the
[51:52] Colorado Rockies thought well let's cool
[51:54] off a little on the way home well no
[51:56] sooner had we gotten to Colorado Springs
[51:58] then the air conditioning died in the
[52:00] car
[52:00] oops
[52:02] so Heather and I looked at each other
[52:04] and said well okay When We Were Young we
[52:06] couldn't afford air conditioning let's
[52:08] be young again so we rolled down the
[52:10] windows and we had to drive them from
[52:12] Colorado Springs to Tucson Arizona in
[52:14] the you know late June early July warmth
[52:17] and on the way of course we passed
[52:20] through the White Mountains and so we
[52:21] were able to get the desire of Heather's
[52:24] heart to get these mantles made and see
[52:26] this guy and I didn't have to travel
[52:28] with them
[52:32] getting back to Acts verse 40. so what
[52:36] happens now
[52:37] Barnabas is on his way to Cyprus take
[52:39] care of business there
[52:41] Paul chose Silas who was Silas we read
[52:44] that he was a prophet from Jerusalem he
[52:46] remained an Antioch with the other
[52:48] brothers from Jerusalem when they had
[52:49] returned after they brought this this
[52:51] message this letter from James and the
[52:53] folks in Jerusalem and departed to
[52:56] places other than Cyprus
[52:58] being recommended being committed by the
[53:01] Brethren under the grace of God and and
[53:03] realize when you see the word brethren
[53:05] in the New Testament the Greek word
[53:07] there is non-gender specific it doesn't
[53:09] mean the brothers it's the brothers and
[53:12] sisters it's it's it's it's an inclusive
[53:14] term it's not gender confused it's just
[53:17] non-gender okay under the grace of God
[53:20] and that's what I want to be
[53:23] I want to be committed by God's grace
[53:25] by my siblings in Christ
[53:28] just like what happened this morning
[53:31] and he and Silas went Overland through
[53:34] Syria and cilicia which included
[53:37] tarsus's Hometown confirming that means
[53:40] re-establishing strengthening
[53:43] the churches just a little reminder
[53:46] I know this is a little hard to see the
[53:48] further back you sit the harder it is to
[53:50] see I'm going to keep making these
[53:51] smaller and smaller but this is this is
[53:54] what the first missionary journey was
[53:56] like and here's where they sailed down
[53:57] to Cyprus they covered Cyprus they got
[53:59] here and John Mark went back but these
[54:02] are the places they want to visit and
[54:03] these places in galatia and forget are
[54:06] places that they want to visit that's
[54:08] what's on Paul's heart so now we read
[54:10] that he went through cilicia
[54:14] and
[54:15] over here to galatia right
[54:19] so let me find my place in my notes
[54:22] because I keep getting confused okay so
[54:25] that's just a brief recap of the first
[54:27] journey here's an overview of what's
[54:29] going to be happening on the second
[54:30] Journey what I've done here is I've
[54:32] labeled a lot of modern countries around
[54:34] here so you can get a little perspective
[54:36] about where this really is this journey
[54:39] is going to take place inside of this
[54:41] rectangle here and we're just going to
[54:43] cover a little bit of it here this
[54:45] evening you'll notice again that Paul
[54:48] and Silas
[54:49] don't go to Cyprus whether the LED comes
[54:52] on or not they still don't go there
[54:55] so uh
[54:57] as we do the journey I'll have the maps
[55:00] zoomed in so even you in the back will
[55:01] be able to see it it's okay you don't
[55:04] have to sit on the front I like it when
[55:06] you do but you don't have to
[55:08] so we go on now to Acts 16.
[55:11] and chapter one
[55:13] then came he it says but that's Paul and
[55:16] Silas to Derby and lystra which you
[55:18] memorized from that map earlier there in
[55:20] galatia
[55:22] it's in the province of galatia behold
[55:23] we read a certain disciple was there
[55:26] this is one who had accepted the gospel
[55:28] on Paul and Barnabas previous Journey
[55:30] his name was timothius or Timothy and
[55:33] says he was a son of a certain woman
[55:35] well yeah I think we're all Sons and
[55:37] Daughters of a certain woman or our
[55:39] mother right this one happened to be
[55:41] named Eunice
[55:42] and we'll read that she was a Jewish she
[55:45] was she was a a Jewish woman and and
[55:48] came to Faith In Jesus when Paul and
[55:50] Barnabas ministered in this area and
[55:51] believed
[55:53] but however his father was a Greek Greek
[55:56] speaking non-jewish
[55:58] so this Timothy was well reported by the
[56:02] Believers the Brethren that were in
[56:04] lystra and Iconium which is there in
[56:07] galatia
[56:08] so him Timothy would Paul have go forth
[56:11] on the journey with himself and Silas he
[56:14] said let's let's add a third guy here so
[56:16] Paul took and circumcised Timothy
[56:19] because of the Jews that were in those
[56:21] quarters
[56:22] for they all knew his father was a Greek
[56:24] now in light of the decree from
[56:26] Jerusalem
[56:27] this act was not required
[56:29] but for the sake of the Jewish people
[56:31] they might encounter on their mission
[56:33] including the Jewish believers
[56:36] Timothy was circumcised as brother
[56:38] Daniel pointed out it was for the sake
[56:40] of the ministry not for the sake of
[56:42] Timothy's salvation
[56:44] as they it's now Paul Silas Timothy went
[56:49] through the cities they delivered to
[56:51] them that the Believers in the cities
[56:53] that they went through the decrees the
[56:55] ordinances the the four things that were
[56:58] in the letter to be observed by the
[57:01] non-jewish Believers
[57:03] that were determined by the apostles and
[57:05] Elders which are in Jerusalem which we
[57:08] studied in Acts 15.
[57:12] so
[57:13] here's here's another map
[57:15] this is where they started acts 15 verse
[57:18] 40 from Antioch they went over Atlanta
[57:20] through Syria and through Silesia and
[57:24] they came here into galatia to to Derby
[57:27] and Iconium where the other big Arrow
[57:29] was pointing there
[57:33] it went through his hometown of Tarsus
[57:35] we don't know there may be other places
[57:36] in galatia besides lystra and Derby that
[57:39] they visited we don't know that it
[57:41] doesn't say they only visited there but
[57:42] it doesn't say where else they may have
[57:44] visited but we are told they went
[57:46] throughout galatia so it's quite
[57:47] possible that they went to more places
[57:49] than that
[57:51] so just as a reminder what was in the
[57:54] decree
[57:55] from the council at Jerusalem what was
[57:57] the result of all the discussions that
[58:00] they had the whole uproar the whole
[58:02] contention and confusion about whether
[58:05] or not Gentile converts to Christianity
[58:07] were required to become proselytes to
[58:09] Judaism
[58:11] if so then that requires male
[58:13] circumcision and a whole raft of rules
[58:15] and regulations something over 600 yeah
[58:19] um I I find it interesting
[58:22] that they talked about this is what
[58:25] Moses commanded and I don't have a slide
[58:27] about this but but but it in the books
[58:31] that we attribute to Moses the
[58:32] pentateuch the first five books we find
[58:34] in Genesis 17 verse 11 and that area
[58:36] where God told Abraham about
[58:39] circumcision and made it a covenant the
[58:42] Hebrew word for Covenant is Brit when an
[58:45] eight-day-old male Jewish child is
[58:46] brought for this procedure it's called a
[58:50] Brit it's called a covenant they don't
[58:52] call it a circumcision it's called
[58:54] Covenant
[58:57] but we find the only other place that
[58:59] Moses really mentions about this is
[59:01] something as a requirement is in
[59:03] Leviticus chapter 12.
[59:05] but in Exodus chapter 4. Moses has had
[59:09] this Burning Bush experience God's told
[59:11] him go down to Egypt he takes his wife
[59:13] his son they get on a donkey he grabs
[59:15] his stick starts heading down to take
[59:17] over Egypt and on the way he comes to an
[59:20] end and it says God tried to kill him
[59:23] tried to kill him he just sent him there
[59:25] why would he try to kill him
[59:28] well it turned out that his son wasn't
[59:29] circumcised
[59:31] Moses wasn't obeying the rules so so
[59:34] Moses wife circumcised him and through
[59:37] which she cut off down at his feet and
[59:39] said something not particularly nice to
[59:41] him and at that point God stepped back
[59:44] and said okay now you can go
[59:47] the next interesting point I find about
[59:49] this
[59:50] is in Joshua chapter 5. and what happens
[59:54] they've gone 40 years in the wilderness
[59:55] they've had Manna come down and I think
[59:58] that just speaks to the grace of God
[1:00:00] because when they cross the River Jordan
[1:00:03] and they're over on the other side now
[1:00:05] and they're ready to start the conquest
[1:00:07] they have to stop
[1:00:09] why do they have to stop because they
[1:00:11] have to circumcise all the male children
[1:00:13] that were born in that entire 40 years
[1:00:16] not one was circumcised Moses did not
[1:00:20] enforce that rule with his own kids he
[1:00:22] didn't enforce it with the children of
[1:00:24] Israel though he wrote down that if you
[1:00:26] don't do this you're cut off
[1:00:27] it's Grace it's Grace we all have quirks
[1:00:31] we all have peculiarities we all have
[1:00:33] personalities
[1:00:35] and God has Grace for us
[1:00:38] well let's review this letter now from
[1:00:41] James acts 15 verse 28 it seemed good to
[1:00:43] the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden
[1:00:45] you with anything beyond the following
[1:00:47] requirements so they put four rules down
[1:00:49] here you to abstain from food sacrifice
[1:00:51] to idols
[1:00:53] okay from blood
[1:00:55] okay from the meat of strangled animals
[1:00:58] okay from sexual immorality
[1:01:01] you will do well to avoid these things
[1:01:04] that's still true today farewell he says
[1:01:08] so part of the reason for these rules
[1:01:10] was based on God's commands to Noah
[1:01:14] After the flood
[1:01:15] recalled back in the garden Adam and Eve
[1:01:18] had one rule and they broke it
[1:01:20] After the flood God tells Noah okay
[1:01:24] populate the Earth be fruitful and
[1:01:26] multiply but I got one rule
[1:01:28] I've got one rule
[1:01:30] and and that rule uh will read in
[1:01:33] Genesis 9 verse 3. it says every moving
[1:01:36] thing that lives shall be meat for you
[1:01:38] food
[1:01:39] there's no Kosher rules here
[1:01:41] even as the green herb I've given you
[1:01:43] all things but
[1:01:46] flesh with the life thereof which is the
[1:01:49] blood thereof
[1:01:50] shall you not eat so black sausage
[1:01:54] no
[1:01:55] okay
[1:01:57] foods that are strangled what's the
[1:01:59] problem there the blood is still in the
[1:02:00] meat
[1:02:02] don't eat it so it's avoid blood and
[1:02:04] this is the Only Rule but it's a rule to
[1:02:07] all mankind Noah wasn't Jewish Noah
[1:02:10] predated that by several Generations
[1:02:13] that's a rule from a Judaism from a
[1:02:15] Jewish perspective all people are
[1:02:18] subject to this rule Jew Gentile doesn't
[1:02:20] matter you're subject to that rule God
[1:02:22] made that rule for everybody after after
[1:02:24] the the After the flood
[1:02:27] so that's why you want to be sure that
[1:02:29] you obey those two rules
[1:02:31] what about these next two
[1:02:33] the rule about food offered to Idols is
[1:02:36] because if you're partaking in that the
[1:02:38] assumption is that you're a pagan and
[1:02:40] you're worshiping those idols and if
[1:02:42] you're doing that well you're not
[1:02:44] worshiping the god of Israel so you're
[1:02:46] probably not going to get into a
[1:02:48] synagogue
[1:02:50] and the same thing Pagan worship is Rife
[1:02:52] with
[1:02:54] sexual activity with wild abandoned so
[1:02:57] that sort of thing also suggests that
[1:02:59] you are a pagan you are not a
[1:03:02] God-fearing person
[1:03:04] and if we read a little further with
[1:03:06] what says here what James said you know
[1:03:09] wherefore my sentences we trouble them
[1:03:11] not which from among the Gentiles are
[1:03:13] turned to God but we write unto them
[1:03:15] that they abstain from pollutions of
[1:03:16] Idols from fornication things strangled
[1:03:18] in from blood
[1:03:20] and and the next verse is interesting
[1:03:22] verse 21 for Moses of old time hath in
[1:03:26] every city then that preach him being
[1:03:28] read in the synagogues every Sabbath day
[1:03:33] that seems a little curious that that
[1:03:36] would be tacked on here or for because
[1:03:40] consider
[1:03:43] the only place that a Christian in the
[1:03:45] first century
[1:03:47] especially the first half of it is going
[1:03:50] to be able to hear the word faith comes
[1:03:52] by hearing the word
[1:03:53] is in a Jewish synagogue
[1:03:56] that's the only place that the word is
[1:03:58] being read there are no churches there
[1:03:59] are no Bibles there are none of these
[1:04:02] things people are are not illiterate
[1:04:05] because illiterate means you're expected
[1:04:07] to be able to read but can't but
[1:04:08] societies were non-literate you weren't
[1:04:11] expected to be able to read and part of
[1:04:14] that was because books didn't exist in
[1:04:16] schools were incredibly expensive
[1:04:18] codices were only starting to come into
[1:04:20] existence which is an early form of a
[1:04:22] book
[1:04:23] so there were no Bibles the only way
[1:04:25] you're going to hear the word of God as
[1:04:27] an early Christian is in a Jewish
[1:04:29] synagogue you want to get to the door of
[1:04:31] the synagogue abstain from blood don't
[1:04:33] eat meat sacrificed Idols Etc this is a
[1:04:36] way for you to hear the word and grow
[1:04:38] your faith
[1:04:39] that's the reason that James is saying
[1:04:41] for these particular uh particular
[1:04:44] things so as a God-fearing Gentile
[1:04:47] you're welcome if you if you observe
[1:04:49] these things
[1:04:51] well let's uh let's get back to Acts 16.
[1:04:55] so we read on that these three guys are
[1:04:57] traveling and so were the churches the
[1:04:59] Ecclesia the called out ones
[1:05:01] the Believers in other words they're
[1:05:04] holding house meetings for the most part
[1:05:06] as I say there were no church buildings
[1:05:08] so they were established in the faith
[1:05:11] and increased and numbered daily
[1:05:15] how does a body of Believers grow
[1:05:17] how do they increase in numbers
[1:05:19] by being Witnesses for Christ
[1:05:22] in your life your actions as well as not
[1:05:26] only but as well as your words
[1:05:29] so now when Dave Paul Silas and Timothy
[1:05:32] had gone throughout forgive
[1:05:34] and the region of galatia
[1:05:37] were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to
[1:05:41] preach the word in Asia
[1:05:43] now you may find this a little hard to
[1:05:45] believe I found a little hard to believe
[1:05:46] what people have insisted to be that
[1:05:48] it's true that some people take that
[1:05:49] first and say we should not witness to
[1:05:52] Japanese people we should not witness to
[1:05:54] Chinese people we should not witness to
[1:05:55] Korean people because Holy Ghost forbade
[1:05:58] them to go to Asia it's not talking
[1:06:00] about what we think of as age it's
[1:06:03] talking about a little chunk of Western
[1:06:04] turkey
[1:06:06] and
[1:06:08] we'll find out in Acts 19 that Paul goes
[1:06:11] to Asia in Acts 19. he's not forbidden
[1:06:14] anymore he spends more than two years
[1:06:15] there
[1:06:18] so so you have to be careful when you
[1:06:21] read these things to understand the
[1:06:22] context and what's really being said so
[1:06:25] they forbidden to to go to Asia why why
[1:06:28] would it say that because when you leave
[1:06:30] fergia you're stepping into Asia so are
[1:06:34] you going to go all through here no okay
[1:06:36] we'll avoid it go around the edge of it
[1:06:38] or something and so what do we read
[1:06:40] after they were come to my Sia going
[1:06:43] around the northern part of Asia there
[1:06:45] they are saved to go they decided Well
[1:06:48] let's go to bithynia we're right here
[1:06:51] Spirit suffered them not
[1:06:53] he had another path in mind for them at
[1:06:55] this time
[1:06:56] if your heart's right
[1:06:58] you start to go with the Lord us that
[1:07:00] wants you to go with that time he'll
[1:07:01] guide you
[1:07:03] he'll guide you I'm not talking about
[1:07:04] then I'm talking about now
[1:07:07] Paul and his group had a right heart
[1:07:09] they were saying they were wanting they
[1:07:11] were trying to do the right thing
[1:07:13] the Lord had laid on their heart to do
[1:07:15] this Paul had this burden but sensitive
[1:07:18] to the nudging of the spirit they were
[1:07:20] kept on the path the Lord desired for
[1:07:22] them and I'm sure he's thinking huh
[1:07:25] I visited all those places Barnabas has
[1:07:28] visited those places in Cyprus that was
[1:07:30] my burden now what am I doing here what
[1:07:34] do you want Lord you don't I'm not
[1:07:35] letting me what after passing by myself
[1:07:39] they came down to trollas
[1:07:41] Metro last is just a town it's a place
[1:07:43] where Luke will see will join them we
[1:07:45] don't know how long they were there
[1:07:46] waiting on the guidance of the Lord they
[1:07:48] might have just got there yesterday and
[1:07:50] leave tomorrow they might have been
[1:07:51] there for days or weeks or months we
[1:07:52] simply don't know
[1:07:55] well getting back to maps because I like
[1:07:58] Maps
[1:07:59] so we see this shows a very direct path
[1:08:01] they want to go to Asia the Lord says uh
[1:08:04] uh well let's go to bithynia no well now
[1:08:09] we wind up over here in trois
[1:08:12] and what are we going to do
[1:08:15] well I should probably tell you another
[1:08:17] little personal story here when I was 13
[1:08:20] years old I was in the eighth grade
[1:08:23] and uh I was in public school
[1:08:26] and I was a nerd we didn't use that term
[1:08:30] then but that's what I was and I had
[1:08:33] some good friends that were also nerds
[1:08:36] and what we got permission from our our
[1:08:39] homeloom teacher in those days we didn't
[1:08:41] have Google and all this kind of stuff
[1:08:43] you know if you go to a gas station and
[1:08:45] those days and you ask a guy from after
[1:08:47] you get a map of the state you get a map
[1:08:49] of the city that there are these paper
[1:08:50] things you unfold and I have pictures
[1:08:51] that look something like that that's
[1:08:53] what a map is for those of you that are
[1:08:55] young
[1:08:55] so we had by the Blackboard in the
[1:08:59] school we had these big things like
[1:09:00] window shades I don't know they're not
[1:09:02] blinds there are things that you pull
[1:09:04] down and roll up these big window shade
[1:09:06] things that were Maps one of them was of
[1:09:08] North America one of them was of Europe
[1:09:10] one of them was of the world and we got
[1:09:12] permission from the teacher that during
[1:09:13] recess when other 13 year olds were
[1:09:15] going out doing whatever 13 year olds do
[1:09:17] at recess we went into the room we
[1:09:20] pulled down a map and we started a game
[1:09:22] and the person one guy was one
[1:09:25] individual was chosen and look at the
[1:09:27] map and you've got so many seconds to
[1:09:29] identify something on the map and then
[1:09:31] State what that is and the other guys
[1:09:33] have to
[1:09:35] find it and as you find it within the
[1:09:37] certain number of seconds then you get
[1:09:38] to choose and if you don't then he says
[1:09:41] it's right here and then and then pick
[1:09:44] the next one so I spent my recesses
[1:09:46] during the Spring of of that year uh
[1:09:50] playing with maps and and I I was a nerd
[1:09:53] I admit I was a nerd yeah but but you
[1:09:56] know later in life my job required that
[1:09:59] I traveled the world
[1:10:00] and it turned out that I would go to a
[1:10:02] country and and and and people think of
[1:10:05] the Ugly American all arrogant and
[1:10:07] demanding this and nothing is good
[1:10:09] enough
[1:10:10] but I knew the geography of their
[1:10:11] country and I could we they could talk
[1:10:14] about something oh you mean that
[1:10:15] whatever that town is up by the
[1:10:17] mountains of so and so and and they look
[1:10:19] at me like are you sure you're an
[1:10:21] American and and and I was able to build
[1:10:24] Bridges to these people and have really
[1:10:25] good relationships I've had people you
[1:10:27] know talk to me and say before I left
[1:10:29] that mine because I was in the mining
[1:10:30] business that
[1:10:32] you've changed our opinion about
[1:10:34] Americans
[1:10:35] I'd like to change their opinion about
[1:10:37] Jesus Christ that's what our business is
[1:10:39] so will you see me with maps up here now
[1:10:42] you know a little bit of the background
[1:10:43] about why brother Lyle is so weird about
[1:10:45] Maps
[1:10:47] one thing I want you to notice on this
[1:10:49] map is there's this area over here this
[1:10:51] purple area it's called Macedonia and
[1:10:54] this little uh whatever color that is
[1:10:57] kind of pale orange Peach maybe I don't
[1:10:59] know it's called Ikea
[1:11:01] and that's Greece
[1:11:04] okay
[1:11:05] so we'll just keep that in mind
[1:11:06] Macedonia agrees okay and let's move on
[1:11:10] to the next verse so
[1:11:12] so while he's intro ass
[1:11:15] a vision appeared to Paul in the night
[1:11:19] now in the vision there's sort of man of
[1:11:22] Macedonia remember that purple area we
[1:11:24] just looked at and prayed him saying
[1:11:27] come over to Macedonia and help us
[1:11:33] Macedonia
[1:11:35] this is like going from the frying pan
[1:11:37] Into the Fire
[1:11:39] Macedonia recall the long battle
[1:11:43] in the Jewish homeland with what we call
[1:11:45] hellenization the greek influence
[1:11:46] Alexander the Great came through
[1:11:48] conquered the place he wanted everybody
[1:11:51] to speak Greek introduce Greek culture
[1:11:53] introduce Greek philosophy introduce
[1:11:55] Greek religion get everybody to to marry
[1:11:57] between everybody and just make every
[1:11:59] the world one great big Hellenistic
[1:12:02] Wonderland
[1:12:03] so this whole influence of Hellenism
[1:12:05] it's what led uh uh Antiochus the four
[1:12:09] Epiphany to sacrifice have the pig
[1:12:10] sacrificed in the Jerusalem Temple that
[1:12:12] led to the maccabean Revolt we we've
[1:12:14] talked about some of these things in the
[1:12:16] past but but but the thing that a lot of
[1:12:19] people may not realize is Alexander the
[1:12:21] Great was not a Greek
[1:12:23] we think of him as being a Greek he was
[1:12:27] Macedonian he conquered Greece
[1:12:29] so going into Macedonia into the very
[1:12:33] heart of hellenization
[1:12:35] and that's where this guy is saying come
[1:12:38] and help us
[1:12:42] Macedonia
[1:12:43] so after Paul had seen the vision
[1:12:46] immediately we who noticed the weed Luke
[1:12:50] has now joined them ever how long they
[1:12:52] were an intro ass I don't know if they
[1:12:53] went there to get Luke I don't know if
[1:12:54] the Lord sent him there to get Luke if
[1:12:56] Luke arrived there don't have any idea
[1:12:58] but Paul Silas Timothy and now the
[1:13:01] physician Luke are all four together so
[1:13:03] they endeavored to go into Macedonia
[1:13:06] they saw it passage you could March
[1:13:08] around but it's a really long way around
[1:13:10] much faster to take a boat
[1:13:12] assuredly Gathering
[1:13:15] assuredly Gathering
[1:13:17] that the Lord had called us for to
[1:13:19] preach the gospel unto them
[1:13:22] and they needed that confidence because
[1:13:24] they were going to run into some really
[1:13:26] serious issues and if you were into
[1:13:29] really serious issues and you're not
[1:13:31] sure the Lord has sent you there
[1:13:32] it adds a certain degree of stress to
[1:13:35] those kinds of situations we also see
[1:13:37] that Luke isn't just an after-the-fact
[1:13:40] historian when he wrote the Gospel
[1:13:42] that's after the fact he's talking to
[1:13:43] people but now he's a participant he's
[1:13:46] right there front and center
[1:13:49] therefore due to this urgency losing
[1:13:53] from troas we came with a straight
[1:13:55] course to the island of samothracia and
[1:13:58] after spending the night there we
[1:13:59] proceeded the next day to theopolis
[1:14:01] which is the nearest Port City in
[1:14:03] Macedonia you memorize that from the map
[1:14:05] I know and from that's from neapolis we
[1:14:09] preceded the short distance five or six
[1:14:11] miles to Philippi which is the chief
[1:14:14] city of that part of Macedonia
[1:14:18] and a colony
[1:14:20] colony
[1:14:22] and we were in that City abiding certain
[1:14:24] days of several days oh there's a map
[1:14:27] again brother while so from Troast to
[1:14:30] Philippi they go to this little island
[1:14:32] here called semothrese spend the night
[1:14:34] then they sail here to that little thing
[1:14:36] that you can't read which is Theophilus
[1:14:38] and then they walk to that next Little
[1:14:40] Dot which is Philippi
[1:14:43] so it took a couple of days
[1:14:46] but what is this about a colony
[1:14:49] what is this about
[1:14:51] Philippi
[1:14:52] why would they go there it's the nearest
[1:14:55] town to troas so that apparently is the
[1:14:58] way the Lord wants them to go the
[1:14:59] nearest uh big settlement there in
[1:15:02] Macedonia
[1:15:03] the Roman Empire consisted of many
[1:15:06] conquered lands
[1:15:08] in many cases the existing political
[1:15:10] structure was left in place like Herod
[1:15:13] the Great King of Judea the Romans
[1:15:16] propped him up but he ran the place sent
[1:15:18] money to Rome they were happy after he
[1:15:21] died things kind of fell apart they
[1:15:23] didn't like it so they put their thumb
[1:15:25] on it turned it into provinces and sent
[1:15:27] Governors over there to run it but in
[1:15:29] many cases they just wanted to not have
[1:15:32] to be so involved just don't fight us
[1:15:35] don't give us a hard time send us money
[1:15:38] that's not enough
[1:15:40] send us more money okay so the purpose
[1:15:43] of a colony was to have a place it's
[1:15:46] Roman territory much like today an
[1:15:48] embassy in a different country is
[1:15:50] considered to be the territory of the
[1:15:52] country whose Embassy that is
[1:15:54] so you have a colony it's Roman
[1:15:57] territory it's inhabited by people then
[1:15:59] that are fiercely loyal to Rome
[1:16:01] it would typically consist of soldiers
[1:16:03] who had completed their military service
[1:16:06] of 30 or more years were Roman citizens
[1:16:09] and they were awarded land in this
[1:16:11] colony
[1:16:12] this established a loyal Force willing
[1:16:14] to take up arms again for the Empire if
[1:16:16] called upon and their very presence
[1:16:19] would intimidate anybody that had other
[1:16:23] ideas
[1:16:24] so typically The Colony would have about
[1:16:27] 30 percent of the population as Roman
[1:16:29] citizens the other 70 percent would not
[1:16:32] be Roman citizens they'd be service
[1:16:34] providers peasant Farmers slaves people
[1:16:37] just needed to keep the place going
[1:16:40] the colony of Philippi in the first
[1:16:43] century had an estimated population of
[1:16:45] ten thousand roughly might have been as
[1:16:48] much as fifteen thousand but probably
[1:16:50] not this early in it the first military
[1:16:52] retirees that established that Colony
[1:16:54] were awarded the land there about 80
[1:16:56] years before Paul and Silas arrived so
[1:17:00] they in their descendants would comprise
[1:17:02] a significant minority and would have
[1:17:04] been very influential
[1:17:06] this all contributes to the stability of
[1:17:09] the Empire the the pox Romana the the
[1:17:11] Peace of Rome
[1:17:13] now the artists rendering here and I'm
[1:17:14] sure you can tell that from the
[1:17:16] photograph
[1:17:16] the artist running of ancient Philippi
[1:17:18] is a possible appearance of the city in
[1:17:21] the first century the photograph is how
[1:17:23] the general area of the archaeological
[1:17:25] site looks today I place arrows to show
[1:17:28] the location of the form or the
[1:17:30] amphitheater where public Gatherings
[1:17:32] would take place this is something that
[1:17:35] uh significant events will happen in the
[1:17:37] latter part of Acts which will be
[1:17:39] Wednesday night God willing
[1:17:41] there's an image of two sides of a coin
[1:17:43] up here I I I own this coin it was
[1:17:47] minted in Philippi sometime between 30
[1:17:49] BC and 20 or so A.D so there's a picture
[1:17:53] of two sides of a coin that was in
[1:17:55] circulation in this colony in this city
[1:17:58] at the time that we're reading about
[1:17:59] right here in the book of Acts
[1:18:02] in Philippi it appears that the Jewish
[1:18:06] population was Tiny
[1:18:09] why do we think this let's go back to
[1:18:11] acts 16 and verse 13.
[1:18:14] it says here that on the Sabbath we went
[1:18:18] to the local synagogue as was our
[1:18:20] customary
[1:18:22] practice no doesn't say that
[1:18:26] it says they went out of the city
[1:18:28] by a Riverside
[1:18:31] why
[1:18:32] where prayer was want to be made was
[1:18:34] likely or regularly or often made and we
[1:18:38] sat down
[1:18:39] and speaking to the women which resorted
[1:18:42] to their
[1:18:43] that's a little curious
[1:18:46] well here's a satellite viewer an aerial
[1:18:48] view of the same thing again I've
[1:18:49] pointed out the amphitheater there's
[1:18:51] this River and you can see the upper
[1:18:53] Arrow up there is where the river goes
[1:18:55] and it and it shows that it's it's a
[1:18:57] baptism site
[1:19:00] so we have to ask a question
[1:19:03] why didn't they go to a synagogue
[1:19:05] what's up with that
[1:19:07] who are these women
[1:19:11] and and why were they there on the
[1:19:13] Sabbath where these ladies the was this
[1:19:15] a reformed Jewish synagogue and these
[1:19:18] ladies were the rabbis
[1:19:20] probably not
[1:19:21] the most likely answer according to the
[1:19:24] early Jewish sources is that there was
[1:19:26] no synagogue in Philippi
[1:19:28] now the reason's not known but but the
[1:19:30] mishnah indicates that for a synagogue
[1:19:33] to form there has to be a minimum of 10
[1:19:35] Jewish men
[1:19:37] Excuse me while I
[1:19:39] become a first century Jew
[1:19:43] the lack of the synagogue suggests the
[1:19:45] population that observed Judaism was
[1:19:47] very small
[1:19:48] Philip had only been founded some 80
[1:19:50] years earlier as a Roman Colony there
[1:19:53] would have been no historical reason for
[1:19:54] a Jewish presence
[1:19:56] so just like we often see in our
[1:19:58] churches today
[1:20:00] there were more women that wanted to
[1:20:02] participate in worship of God than men
[1:20:04] at least in Philippi
[1:20:06] so Paul and his group went to the place
[1:20:08] where they discovered prayers were
[1:20:09] offered on the Sabbath and began to
[1:20:11] speak with the people there
[1:20:13] in this case they were either only or
[1:20:16] perhaps
[1:20:17] predominantly women everybody see the
[1:20:20] river down here
[1:20:23] oh
[1:20:24] there's a beautiful young woman here by
[1:20:27] the river
[1:20:30] hi there
[1:20:32] oh wait a second
[1:20:40] it's number one
[1:20:43] first century so it's number one
[1:20:47] did I cover for that calf okay
[1:20:50] okay that's
[1:20:52] good so I'm new in town I see you and
[1:20:55] several others are gathered here by the
[1:20:57] river
[1:20:57] why is that
[1:20:59] we're here to worship our God
[1:21:02] we're here to worship I don't I don't
[1:21:04] see any temples or shrines around here
[1:21:06] how how how is that possible what God
[1:21:09] are you praying to
[1:21:12] the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob the
[1:21:16] god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob but
[1:21:17] there's no there's no Temple or anything
[1:21:20] for here
[1:21:22] Abraham Isaac and Jacob shouldn't there
[1:21:25] be a synagogue or something here then
[1:21:28] Philippi is a pretty
[1:21:31] New Colony there hasn't been time to
[1:21:34] build one I see
[1:21:37] well I have to tell you in case you
[1:21:39] haven't figured out that me and my
[1:21:40] companions who are Jews we also worship
[1:21:43] that same God are you Jewish

[1:23:42] that his audience was
[1:23:44] largely female stop or even slow Paul
[1:23:47] down
[1:23:49] was he somehow less respectful or less
[1:23:51] concerned
[1:23:53] not at all
[1:23:55] we often get it in our heads that just
[1:23:58] because someone has a different role in
[1:24:00] life than we might have
[1:24:03] that that one is better or more
[1:24:05] important
[1:24:06] or something or other but like brother
[1:24:09] Daniel talked about this morning about a
[1:24:10] jigsaw puzzle
[1:24:12] you have to have every piece
[1:24:14] if any
[1:24:16] piece is missing opposal is not complete
[1:24:19] so every piece is just as important as
[1:24:22] every other
[1:24:25] I think we have to keep that in mind
[1:24:27] when we're when we're talking with
[1:24:29] people dealing with people because we're
[1:24:31] talking about the body of Christ
[1:24:34] every piece is as important as every
[1:24:37] other
[1:24:39] there's no big eyes and little use
[1:24:43] so we read here that a certain woman
[1:24:46] named Lydia a seller of purple
[1:24:48] we we just met her
[1:24:51] a seller of purple dyed cloth it was
[1:24:53] very expensive in those days dyes came
[1:24:56] from natural sources snails shellfish
[1:24:58] fruits berries and so forth Lydia was an
[1:25:01] industrious worker
[1:25:03] she was a successful Merchant
[1:25:06] she was of the city of fire retira which
[1:25:09] worshiped God and heard us
[1:25:11] huh oh another map must be brother Lyle
[1:25:15] this map shows a different possible
[1:25:17] route going looping up here through
[1:25:19] galatia we simply don't know
[1:25:23] I wanted to point out that we don't know
[1:25:25] those specific routes that they took but
[1:25:28] more importantly this shows a region and
[1:25:31] the area of Asia
[1:25:34] a region of Lydia
[1:25:37] and it's even marked in purple imagine
[1:25:40] that
[1:25:41] it's kind of like a county within a
[1:25:43] state if you will and and thyatira is
[1:25:47] this little red dot right there in uh
[1:25:51] in Asia in this region of of of Lydia
[1:25:56] now we don't know
[1:25:58] if Lydia was of Jewish Heritage or
[1:26:01] descent
[1:26:04] she was in a city that lacked a
[1:26:05] synagogue how did she become a believer
[1:26:08] in the one true God
[1:26:10] we simply don't know
[1:26:12] was she a God-fearing Gentile
[1:26:15] but we do know that she honored the
[1:26:17] Sabbath
[1:26:18] she worshiped God
[1:26:20] and she listened to what the evangelists
[1:26:23] spoke with her
[1:26:26] a certain woman named Lydia a seller of
[1:26:28] purple of the city of fire attire which
[1:26:30] worshiped God heard us whose heart
[1:26:33] Paul's clever words
[1:26:35] reached no no Silas fire and brimstone
[1:26:38] preaching
[1:26:39] no Timothy's gentle persuasion
[1:26:44] Luke's scholarly teaching
[1:26:46] no
[1:26:47] heart the Lord
[1:26:50] and what was the result
[1:26:52] that she attended to she listened she
[1:26:55] understood she accepted she believed he
[1:26:59] patiently explained the things which
[1:27:01] were spoken of Paul it reminds me of
[1:27:03] proverbs 31.
[1:27:06] I'm sure many of you are familiar with
[1:27:08] proverbs 31 if you're not you've got a
[1:27:10] homework assignment proverbs 31.
[1:27:15] and when she Lydia was baptized you
[1:27:18] remember the aerial view that I showed
[1:27:19] you and the arrow of Where the River was
[1:27:21] there's a shrine a thing that's built
[1:27:24] there where they believe that this Lydia
[1:27:25] was baptized at Philip I don't know if
[1:27:28] she was or she wasn't but the river's
[1:27:30] there
[1:27:31] when Lydia was baptized
[1:27:33] and her household
[1:27:36] it wasn't just Lydia it wasn't only
[1:27:40] Lydia I should say she besought us
[1:27:44] saying if you have judged me to be
[1:27:47] faithful to the Lord
[1:27:49] come into my house and abide there
[1:27:52] okay
[1:27:56] that that's good they've got a place to
[1:27:58] stay
[1:27:59] and they're going to be sharing more and
[1:28:01] more about the Lord with her her faith
[1:28:03] is going to get grounded anchored
[1:28:05] deepened strengthened
[1:28:07] well I don't know Lydia man she
[1:28:10] constrained us
[1:28:13] she kept asking she would not take no
[1:28:15] for an answer
[1:28:17] stubbornly
[1:28:19] steadfastly insisted
[1:28:21] until we agreed
[1:28:23] Lydia is an important person in the acts
[1:28:27] narrative
[1:28:28] but why it's told we're told that she's
[1:28:31] from fire Tyra
[1:28:33] why would Luke mention this
[1:28:35] he doesn't mention where everybody else
[1:28:37] was born
[1:28:38] why would he mention she's from thyatira
[1:28:44] it's it seems a little puzzling
[1:28:47] well we know that people from different
[1:28:49] parts of the world here share certain
[1:28:51] traits we sometimes speak of a national
[1:28:53] Spirit right like Americans tend to take
[1:28:56] things lightly joke around a little bit
[1:28:58] people from Switzerland tend to be very
[1:29:00] precise
[1:29:02] well when John the Revelator
[1:29:04] was instructed to write letters to the
[1:29:07] seven churches of Asia
[1:29:08] each had a certain characteristic
[1:29:11] these mapped into what we call the
[1:29:13] church ages if the musicians would
[1:29:15] please come
[1:29:17] what were the characteristics then
[1:29:19] of phiatira
[1:29:22] Revelation 2 19 Jesus speaking to John
[1:29:26] says I Know Thy works
[1:29:30] you're doing something
[1:29:32] and charity
[1:29:33] Your Love
[1:29:35] and your service
[1:29:37] to one another your faith
[1:29:40] in the Lord your patience
[1:29:44] and thy Works he mentions Works twice
[1:29:46] very industrious and the last
[1:29:50] to me more than the first
[1:29:53] do these characteristics seem to apply
[1:29:55] to this lady praying by the river
[1:29:59] I think it's pretty clear that they do
[1:30:02] and these are all characteristics that
[1:30:04] we should desire to have as Christians
[1:30:06] in Tucson in 2023
[1:30:10] we need to be careful how we view others
[1:30:14] to have love and respect for each other
[1:30:17] to be free to serve
[1:30:20] I'm reminded of a song
[1:30:23] I don't need you all to help me sing it
[1:30:26] these folks know that I'm between the
[1:30:28] Frets on the guitar between the whatever
[1:30:31] they call thems on the
[1:30:33] on the thing you blow on
[1:30:35] and I'm certainly between the keys
[1:30:39] but the song that I want to sing is
[1:30:41] thank God I'm free it's written by the
[1:30:43] Gaithers please help me sing this
[1:30:48] thank God I am free free
