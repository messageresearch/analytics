[48:19] raised in um sem of God
[48:22] church and I see how things were then

[48:37] we're in the age for that and I thank

[48:56] 89 years old significant Sister Margaret

[49:02] where where did
[49:03] you where is
[49:06] she
[49:09] where oh happy
[49:11] birthday God bless
[49:19] you
[49:21] um there's been a lot change I'm sure
[49:26] over the past 89
[49:29] years and uh one of the things that I
[49:31] wanted to mention to the church before
[49:33] we the Sunday School gets back and
[49:35] before
[49:36] we have the baby dedication um one of
[49:39] the things that happened this past week
[49:42] that has just been I think a tragedy to
[49:46] this
[49:47] country and as you know I'm not I'm not
[49:51] a fan of of any of the politicians and I
[49:53] I don't really I don't really support
[49:57] um anyone I want what's best for this
[50:00] country but this past week what has
[50:03] happened in them trying a former
[50:05] president and convicting
[50:08] him and in the situation and and the
[50:11] circumstances which he was convicted
[50:14] brothers and sisters I think that we
[50:15] have seen something this week that we
[50:17] might look upon this 20 years from now
[50:20] and see that was a sign that our country
[50:24] was going into freefall
[50:27] this man Donald Trump was tried in a
[50:31] court we are guaranteed by our
[50:33] Constitution that we are guaranteed a
[50:36] trial by our
[50:38] peers and he was tried in a court in an
[50:42] area and this man's a politician former
[50:45] president and running for president
[50:47] right now he was tried in a place that's
[50:49] 95%
[50:52] Democrat and there's no way that he
[50:56] could have had a fair trial and he
[50:58] didn't have a fair trial these things
[51:00] that have
[51:01] happened it is it is a shame and it's a
[51:06] shame on our country that a politician a
[51:10] a government can go after a political
[51:13] rival in the courts like has happened
[51:16] and like I said before you all know me
[51:18] I'm not a fan of Donald Trump I don't
[51:20] like his arrogance I don't like his
[51:22] immoral living I don't like his language
[51:25] but it's it's wrong
[51:28] and to see our country
[51:31] now making a stand making some of the
[51:35] stands that we've made making a stand
[51:37] against
[51:39] Israel and Israel tell us trying to
[51:43] influence them not to go in and fight
[51:45] their enemies that came into their
[51:47] cities that killed their people that
[51:50] raped their women that burned their
[51:54] babies and then for us to try to use our
[51:56] political clout as the United States to
[51:59] tell them that they can't do something
[52:02] this is a shame this is the same
[52:05] country that was in
[52:07] Egypt that God brought down the plagues
[52:10] upon their their captors that God
[52:14] brought down turned the water into blood
[52:18] brought fleas and brought flies and
[52:20] brought hail of fire that came down and
[52:23] killed the firstborn son and this the
[52:26] history of this country and our country
[52:28] makes a
[52:30] stand and
[52:32] says that you can't do this trying to
[52:34] use our political Advantage trying to
[52:36] use our money and our arms to do this
[52:38] brothers and sisters it should not be
[52:41] so it is
[52:43] prophesied that Israel whatever blesses
[52:45] you will be blessed and whatever curses
[52:47] you will be
[52:48] cursed those prophecies are Eternal
[52:51] brothers and sisters they don't just end
[52:54] and we see that today
[52:57] and we see what's happening and we see
[52:59] this this election and all this fighting
[53:02] that's going on like I said we are in a
[53:04] time that has never
[53:07] been going after each other politically
[53:10] going after each other with the law and
[53:12] we're making all of these issues about
[53:15] the border and about the economy and
[53:18] about gun control and there's one person
[53:21] that we are leaving out of this and
[53:23] that's
[53:24] God God Jesus Christ should be on the
[53:28] ballot not all of this other nonsense
[53:30] and and the the election should be about
[53:33] who is standing the most for God and not
[53:36] about all these ridiculous political
[53:39] issues I just it makes me sad it makes
[53:42] me it makes me
[53:44] sick I
[53:46] uh if they would do what I just said and
[53:50] I know it's cliche and I I know it's
[53:51] easy to say but if they would put Christ
[53:53] first if they would put God first then
[53:56] they would be able to reach across the
[53:58] aisle like our founding fathers did and
[54:00] they may not have agreed but they looked
[54:02] and they saw what was best for the
[54:04] people of this country instead of just
[54:06] trying to get their way instead of
[54:09] trying to push their agenda and many
[54:12] times it's just
[54:14] little special interests things that
[54:18] they try to get and and like I said I'm
[54:21] not a political person I've only I I'll
[54:26] share a secret with you I think I've
[54:27] only voted one time in my life and it
[54:30] was for
[54:32] a a House of Representatives someone
[54:34] that helped us in Jeffersonville one
[54:37] time and and uh so I'm not I'm not a
[54:40] political person I'm sorry I probably
[54:42] should vote but
[54:44] um it's wrong it's wrong what this
[54:47] country is
[54:48] doing and I I worry that the direction
[54:53] we're headed and the Precedence is being
[54:55] set is going to lead to what we see now
[54:59] in Russia and what we see in these
[55:01] different countries and it's a shame
[55:04] it's a stain on our flag is what it is I
[55:10] um wanted to read something that I've
[55:14] been listening to um this Hebrew series
[55:18] from brother brandom and and if um you
[55:23] could put up this quote that I gave you
[55:26] you Brothers brother Bram said this he
[55:30] says and then when we see those things
[55:33] take place that we do see take place and
[55:36] done we should never let these things
[55:38] slip we just let it go through our
[55:41] fingers and that's what the that's
[55:42] what's the matter with this the great
[55:44] Pentecostal church today they've let the
[55:47] very cream of the crop slip through
[55:49] their fingers when they had it in their
[55:52] hands but look what they done they' done
[55:55] like the rest of of the churches they've
[55:58] run in the way of Kora and perished in
[56:00] the way of Cain and perished in the gang
[56:02] Saints of Kora they've organized instead
[56:05] of having Brotherhood where we could all
[56:07] be one they've organized themselves made
[56:09] little organizations and little isms and
[56:11] sprung up from there and just broke up
[56:14] the Brotherhood and if you don't watch
[56:16] the Baptists and the Presbyterians is
[56:18] going to pick it up because God is able
[56:20] of these stones to rise children of
[56:22] Abraham and we've let it slip away from
[56:24] the hands by being
[56:29] disunified how did the Indians lose this
[56:31] country to the white man is because they
[56:33] were disunified if they had been one big
[56:35] Forefront but they were fighting one
[56:38] among each other they would have had
[56:41] they would have held their grounds if
[56:43] they would have all come together how
[56:45] are we going to lose it because we're
[56:49] disunified how are we going to lose our
[56:51] experience with God is because we dis
[56:54] unify
[56:56] we set up one and call this the
[56:58] Methodist and this the Baptist and this
[57:00] the assemblies and this the Oneness and
[57:02] this something else and the Church of
[57:04] God and the Nazarene and the pilgrim
[57:05] Holiness we dis unify the body of Christ
[57:08] we should never be
[57:12] divided we might differ in
[57:15] ideas but let's be heart inhe heart
[57:18] Brothers God wants us to be he died for
[57:22] the entire Church of God and we do not
[57:25] want want to be
[57:28] disunified even in our little portion of
[57:32] the body of Christ and what do we do
[57:36] this one has this doctrine that one has
[57:39] that
[57:41] Doctrine and it causes us to divide it
[57:44] causes us to
[57:47] fight or brothers and sisters are we
[57:52] Christians are we just Christians
[57:56] that should unite us and that is the
[57:58] only thing that will ever unite the body
[58:01] of Christ is the man Christ Jesus no
[58:04] matter what what sect you're from no
[58:06] matter what denomination you're from no
[58:09] matter what he is the only
[58:12] one that can can that can unite
[58:17] us and our I fear and I I see and I I
[58:21] know we can all see
[58:23] this that the
[58:25] disunity that is in the body of Christ
[58:28] and when I say body of Christ I mean
[58:31] Body of Christ I don't mean the message
[58:33] denomination and the Baptist
[58:34] denomination and the Pentecostal
[58:36] denomination I mean Jesus I mean
[58:38] Christians ones that really believe
[58:40] Christians and believe Christ and we see
[58:43] that
[58:45] disunity and it comes all the way up to
[58:48] their
[58:49] government the Republicans and the
[58:51] Democrats and and fighting over these
[58:53] little things but if we would all put
[58:56] our Lord first then things would
[58:59] change and I just wanted to I wanted to
[59:03] say that before we got get started that
[59:07] I really believe that our country made a
[59:09] very very bad decision this week we saw
[59:13] the man we saw the
[59:14] manifestations of the wrong spirit and
[59:17] that is going after your enemies if we
[59:20] were Christians Jesus said to pray for
[59:23] your
[59:24] enemies Jesus said to love those that
[59:29] hate you and would despitefully use you
[59:32] where is Christianity Today there is
[59:35] nothing higher than the Lord Jesus and I
[59:37] look at it's we see it on the news and
[59:39] we look into all the way down and we see
[59:42] it in our inside of our
[59:43] families and it's Satan trying to get in
[59:47] everything and stirring everything up
[59:48] and cause hatred and cause disunity and
[59:52] cause
[59:53] fighting and it will never come to good
[59:57] it never has it never will God wants us
[1:00:01] together not an organization like I just
[1:00:04] read brother brandom said we can differ
[1:00:05] on things that's okay but when we fight
[1:00:09] against each other that's that's when we
[1:00:13] fail we uh we have a special honor this
[1:00:17] morning of being able to dedicate
[1:00:19] another child to the Lord Jesus Jesus
[1:00:22] said he said suffer the little ones to
[1:00:25] come to me and forbid them not so when
[1:00:27] they brought the the babies to Jesus
[1:00:30] they just wanted him to bless them and
[1:00:34] and the disciples were like he's busy
[1:00:36] and and they tried to cut him out and
[1:00:37] he's like no no no no no this is
[1:00:39] something that I want to do this is
[1:00:42] something he said bring them to me he
[1:00:44] said because the kingdom is like this he
[1:00:47] says if we could just be like these
[1:00:50] child brother brother Jeremy and sister
[1:00:52] Angela if you come if we could just be
[1:00:54] like these children
[1:00:56] just totally dependent on mama and daddy
[1:01:00] to take care of them if we could just be
[1:01:03] more like that then we would inherit the
[1:01:06] Kingdom then our lives would be better
[1:01:09] then everything that we have need of
[1:01:12] would be provided for
[1:01:13] [Music]

[1:01:18] sing don't you sing

[1:03:42] [Applause]
[1:03:51] you we um brother Mark we started on a a
[1:03:55] series series on the
[1:03:57] Hebrews and um we started last week we
[1:03:59] devoted part of the service to that and
[1:04:01] i' would like to continue as long as the
[1:04:03] Lord is leading let's continue on with
[1:04:07] this great book this great letter of the
[1:04:10] Hebrews and uh we will continue on um
[1:04:14] the Lord's willing we'll see how far we
[1:04:16] get through today but it's a it's a
[1:04:18] tremendous book
[1:04:21] and as we see this day approaching as we
[1:04:24] see all these problems s and that I was
[1:04:27] just talking about it's it's a time it's
[1:04:30] a time for mourning and it's a time to
[1:04:33] to to be
[1:04:35] sorrowful but it's also a time that when
[1:04:38] we see these things happening around us
[1:04:41] it's a time for us to look up because we
[1:04:43] know that our Redemption is drawing nigh
[1:04:47] and this book tells us that because of
[1:04:51] the sacrifice of
[1:04:53] one that
[1:04:57] things everything in the Bible came in
[1:05:01] order when Jesus arrived here on the
[1:05:06] scene he was the great one he was the
[1:05:09] greatest of the
[1:05:10] great let's uh let's review and let's go
[1:05:13] to Hebrews chapter
[1:05:15] 1 verse
[1:05:18] one says this God who had sundry times
[1:05:20] and in diverse manners spake in time
[1:05:23] past under the fathers by the prophets
[1:05:26] hath in these last days spoken unto us
[1:05:30] by his son whom he hath app appointed
[1:05:33] heir of all things and by whom also he
[1:05:35] made the
[1:05:37] worlds so don't forget the author of
[1:05:41] this book he had never met Jesus In the
[1:05:46] Flesh he came to the Revelation by
[1:05:49] through someone else's um someone else's
[1:05:52] witness and then he says that God spoke
[1:05:55] to To Us by his son so this isn't Peter
[1:05:59] and James and John speaking that they
[1:06:02] could say that we are the witnesses we
[1:06:05] gave witness he he spoke to us and then
[1:06:07] we gave you all this message no this is
[1:06:11] this man is saying that God actually
[1:06:13] spoke to
[1:06:15] me by this man Jesus Christ who had
[1:06:18] already resurrected already gone up to
[1:06:21] be with the father and it's we can put
[1:06:24] ourselves in that situation
[1:06:26] now if this man who wrote the book of
[1:06:30] Hebrews can say that God spoke to
[1:06:34] him us then we can say the
[1:06:38] same who being the brightness of his
[1:06:42] glory and the expressed image of his
[1:06:45] person and upholding All Things by the
[1:06:47] word of his power when he had by himself
[1:06:50] purged our sins and sat down on the
[1:06:53] right hand of the Majesty on on
[1:06:57] high this
[1:07:00] man that the letter is talking about he
[1:07:04] was the brightness of the father's glory
[1:07:08] and he is the express image of his
[1:07:10] person so in the NIV version says the
[1:07:14] sun is the radiance of God's glory and
[1:07:17] the exact representation of his being
[1:07:20] that Radiance of God's glory is the
[1:07:23] shikina glory that that we hear so much
[1:07:26] about it's that it was manifested itself
[1:07:29] in the pillar of fire in the pillar of
[1:07:31] cloud when the Hebrews were coming out
[1:07:34] of Egypt that led them the author is
[1:07:37] writing to the ancestors of the ones
[1:07:40] that came out of Egypt these people
[1:07:42] called the
[1:07:43] Hebrews and he's saying that our fathers
[1:07:46] were there in Exodus 33 when God spoke
[1:07:49] to Moses out of the cloud and Moses
[1:07:52] desired to see God this was the Radiance
[1:07:56] of
[1:07:57] God that was speaking to Moses this was
[1:08:01] that shikina Glory it was the brightness
[1:08:04] of his glory and the author is saying
[1:08:05] that Jesus is the one that was that
[1:08:11] Radiance of
[1:08:13] Glory he was that shikina glory in the
[1:08:16] wilderness this man Jesus the author
[1:08:20] could not Lift Jesus any higher than he
[1:08:22] lifted him and then he goes on to say
[1:08:25] that he is the express image of God he
[1:08:27] is the exact representation of God so
[1:08:30] when you look at
[1:08:32] Jesus you're looking at
[1:08:37] god brother Josiah and I were talking in
[1:08:40] the back and and uh we were talking
[1:08:42] about something completely
[1:08:43] unrelated and brother Josiah shared a
[1:08:48] scripture with
[1:08:50] me let me read it in John chapter 1
[1:08:56] verse 6 it says this John 1:6 there was
[1:08:59] a man sent from God whose name was John
[1:09:02] the same came for a witness to Bear
[1:09:04] witness of the light that all men
[1:09:07] through him might believe he was not
[1:09:09] that light but was sent to Bear witness
[1:09:12] of that light that is the shakor that's
[1:09:15] the radiance of God that this man John
[1:09:18] the Baptist is witnessing too that is
[1:09:20] Jesus Christ himself that was the True
[1:09:23] Light which lith every every man that
[1:09:26] cometh into the world he was in the
[1:09:28] world and the world was made by him and
[1:09:31] the world knew him
[1:09:33] not that Radiance of God and the author
[1:09:37] here is speaking to this Hebrew audience
[1:09:40] and he's saying that this man was not
[1:09:44] just the
[1:09:45] Messiah maybe you don't know what the
[1:09:47] Messiah is and he goes and he writes
[1:09:50] this whole book to show us what the
[1:09:54] Messiah is in John 14
[1:09:56] chapter 6 Jesus is speaking to Thomas
[1:10:02] Jesus saith unto him I am the way the
[1:10:05] truth and the life no man cometh to the
[1:10:08] father but by me today we hear so much
[1:10:11] from people if you witness to someone
[1:10:14] you'll say are you a Christian and we
[1:10:16] all do or we should and the people so
[1:10:19] often they say that well I believe I
[1:10:21] believe there's a higher power or I
[1:10:24] believe that
[1:10:26] there is a God or I
[1:10:29] pray but to call themselves a Christian
[1:10:33] they always want to push it off to
[1:10:34] something else or even they'll say it
[1:10:39] happened to me the other day I I would
[1:10:40] witness to a a lady and I said are you a
[1:10:45] Christian and she said no she said I'm
[1:10:50] Catholic
[1:10:52] that's that's that's bad that's an
[1:10:54] insult
[1:10:56] no I'm not a Christian I'm a
[1:10:58] Catholic how many of us say well I'm a
[1:11:00] message believer or I'm a Baptist or I'm
[1:11:03] something else and we lessen Jesus by
[1:11:06] saying that it's always Jesus plus
[1:11:11] something I'm I'm against drawing a
[1:11:15] circle as you know I always it's it's
[1:11:17] really my Ministry it's like no Reach
[1:11:19] Out bring everybody in but the message
[1:11:24] of Jesus Christ is exclusive brothers
[1:11:26] and
[1:11:27] sisters when Jesus said that no man can
[1:11:30] come to the father except by me you know
[1:11:33] what he meant he meant no man can come
[1:11:36] to the father except by me he means that
[1:11:39] there there's only one way to come to
[1:11:43] God and that's through Jesus Christ so
[1:11:46] it's not you can't come through just
[1:11:48] saying I'm spiritual or you can't come
[1:11:51] through saying that well I believe there
[1:11:53] is a God there is only one way to God
[1:11:56] and that is through the son Jesus Christ
[1:11:58] so you can't be a devout Muslim you
[1:12:01] can't be a devout Hindu or Buddhist you
[1:12:03] you have to know Christ or you can't
[1:12:06] make it that's the Bible so not joining
[1:12:11] it not joining a denomination not
[1:12:13] accepting a certain man and not going to
[1:12:16] church but truly meeting Jesus Christ
[1:12:20] accepting him as your savior and
[1:12:23] receiving his Spirit into your heart
[1:12:25] heart that is the only way and there is
[1:12:27] no other
[1:12:29] way Jesus continues verse 7 he says if
[1:12:33] you had known me you should have known
[1:12:35] my father also and from henceforth ye
[1:12:38] know him and have seen him and Philip
[1:12:40] saith unto him he's a bit
[1:12:42] confused he sees Jesus he says this man
[1:12:45] that that they knew that was the Messiah
[1:12:48] that they knew was a Son of God but
[1:12:50] there was something
[1:12:52] more even more than that
[1:12:56] and Philip was confused and he said unto
[1:12:58] him he said 'lord show us the father
[1:13:02] you're talking about the father show us
[1:13:04] the father and it sufficeth us so Philip
[1:13:07] asked Jesus he said we want to know we
[1:13:11] want to know who this Jehovah of the old
[1:13:13] Old Testament this El Shai this Elohim
[1:13:16] this Yahweh who is this Everlasting
[1:13:19] father who is this show us this man and
[1:13:22] watch how Jesus responds to the question
[1:13:25] to see the almighty God Jesus said unto
[1:13:28] him have
[1:13:30] I been with you have I been so long time
[1:13:35] with you and yet hast thou not known me
[1:13:39] he's answering the question Philip is
[1:13:41] saying show us the father and he says
[1:13:43] how do you not know
[1:13:45] me he that hath seen me hath seen the
[1:13:49] father and how sayest then show us the
[1:13:52] father so right here we see that God
[1:13:54] isn't three separate but equal Gods
[1:13:57] having his own personality the son is
[1:14:00] the express image of the father they
[1:14:02] don't just bear a resemblance to each
[1:14:04] other they are the
[1:14:07] same and Jesus said that no man can come
[1:14:09] to the father except by Christ so you
[1:14:13] see brother Daniel are you saying that
[1:14:16] my friends they're good people they
[1:14:18] can't go to heaven unless they're
[1:14:21] Christians are you saying that all these
[1:14:23] people are lost or doomed because they
[1:14:27] accept something else a way of living or
[1:14:30] they accept something else for Christ
[1:14:32] are you are you saying that that's the
[1:14:35] case no I'm not saying that the Bible is
[1:14:39] saying
[1:14:40] that that's not
[1:14:42] me that is the doctrine of Jesus
[1:14:49] Christ if you don't
[1:14:51] know the bridegroom brothers and sisters
[1:14:55] then and you have not accepted him as
[1:14:59] your savior then you can't you really
[1:15:01] can't enter into the kingdom you say
[1:15:03] well I believe a prophet they said the
[1:15:05] same thing to Jesus and he said if you
[1:15:07] would have believed Moses then you would
[1:15:09] believe me because Moses wrote of
[1:15:12] me so when you make the commitment to be
[1:15:16] a Christian it should start a change in
[1:15:18] your life and I'm not talking about how
[1:15:20] you dress I'm not talking about how you
[1:15:22] look I'm not talking about all these
[1:15:24] other things I'm talking there should be
[1:15:25] a categorical change in your life where
[1:15:27] you come into the presence of the
[1:15:29] almighty God and you speak to him and he
[1:15:32] speaks back to you and then all of these
[1:15:35] other things they will
[1:15:38] change your life will change your words
[1:15:41] will
[1:15:43] change your whole being will change
[1:15:45] because now brother Mark it's not you
[1:15:49] anymore it's Jesus Christ in
[1:15:52] you that is the power of God and it's
[1:15:56] this
[1:15:57] man
[1:16:00] Jesus made it to where we could enter
[1:16:03] into that fellowship with God the father
[1:16:05] and only through one man can you do this
[1:16:09] and that man's name is
[1:16:11] Jesus I may sound
[1:16:15] simple but it gets even more simple John
[1:16:19] 3:16 Says this for God so loved the
[1:16:21] world that he gave his only begotten son
[1:16:24] that whosoever whoever believeth in him
[1:16:27] should not perish but have everlasting
[1:16:29] life so when so he's saying that you
[1:16:33] have to believe in this man me basically
[1:16:35] he's speaking of himself that you have
[1:16:37] to believe in Jesus to receive this
[1:16:40] everlasting
[1:16:43] life let's go on a little bit let's stay
[1:16:45] with that John 11:20 says this this is
[1:16:48] when Lazarus was sick he died Jesus
[1:16:52] waited four days and then
[1:16:55] Came John 11 11:20 says this then Martha
[1:16:59] as soon as she had heard that Jesus was
[1:17:01] coming went and met him but Mary sat
[1:17:04] still in the house then Martha then said
[1:17:07] Martha unto Jesus if thou Hast been here
[1:17:09] my brother had not died look at the
[1:17:11] faith that that sister had but I know
[1:17:13] that even now whatsoever thou will ask
[1:17:16] of God God will give thee Jesus saith
[1:17:18] unto her thy brother shall rise again
[1:17:21] Martha saith unto him I know that he
[1:17:24] shall rise again in the resurrection at
[1:17:26] the last
[1:17:27] day Jesus said unto her I am the
[1:17:31] resurrection and the life he that
[1:17:35] believeth in me remember John 3:16 he
[1:17:39] that believeth in me though he were dead
[1:17:41] yet shall he live and whosoever liveth
[1:17:43] and believeth in me shall never die
[1:17:46] believest thou
[1:17:47] this she said unto him yay Lord I
[1:17:50] believe that thou art the Christ the son
[1:17:53] of God which should come into the
[1:17:56] world but we see in other places we hear
[1:18:00] so often I believe Jesus therefore John
[1:18:03] 3:16 and and this this other this John
[1:18:06] 11 therefore I fulfill
[1:18:08] that but it's more than just saying it
[1:18:14] with your mouth we see places in the
[1:18:17] Bible where Satan
[1:18:19] himself knew that Jesus was the son of
[1:18:23] God so does that mean Satan
[1:18:27] saved it doesn't but Satan knows who he
[1:18:30] is so if you say that I just I accept
[1:18:33] Jesus Satan did that there's more to it
[1:18:37] there has to be a change in our lives
[1:18:41] it's not just to say that you believe
[1:18:44] Jesus the devil say the same thing
[1:18:46] there's more you need to surrender to
[1:18:48] him and stop fighting with him remember
[1:18:50] Legion when Legion he was running around
[1:18:54] and naked and all of these problems and
[1:18:57] he was crying out thou son of the Living
[1:19:03] God and Jesus came and cast out the
[1:19:06] demons that were the demons that were
[1:19:09] saying
[1:19:12] that but we brothers and sisters we
[1:19:16] fight against
[1:19:18] God and we fight against God we get
[1:19:21] depressed we worry about our kids we
[1:19:23] worry about our jobs we we we want our
[1:19:27] kids to live up to way our way of
[1:19:29] thinking and in doing that so often we
[1:19:33] are found fighting against him because
[1:19:36] we have something in our minds that we
[1:19:39] think they should live up to or or a
[1:19:41] friend or a job or what it whatever it
[1:19:44] is we think that it should it should
[1:19:45] live up to our way of thinking and it's
[1:19:48] God that wants us to surrender and he's
[1:19:51] there but he requires a separation and
[1:19:54] he requires a surrender for us to come
[1:19:57] to him and then he will do it his way
[1:20:00] he's Sovereign he doesn't answer to
[1:20:03] us he's
[1:20:05] God friend of mine I was I was talking
[1:20:08] to a sister yesterday and she was giving
[1:20:10] me a a wonderful testimony of her
[1:20:12] son her son she was so worried about him
[1:20:16] he was in his 30s he um wasn't going to
[1:20:19] church he he didn't he couldn't hold
[1:20:21] down a a a good job that could support a
[1:20:24] family he wasn't married it was just
[1:20:28] everything that she was praying about
[1:20:29] she's like Lord help him help him to
[1:20:31] find the right girl Lord help him to
[1:20:33] find the right job Lord let him come to
[1:20:35] church and in praying and praying and
[1:20:37] all these years she was praying year
[1:20:39] after year after year praying the same
[1:20:41] thing and then she
[1:20:45] realized that she was
[1:20:48] wrong and she took in her prayers took
[1:20:53] her son and said Lord I give him to
[1:20:56] you whatever you want to do Lord I'm
[1:20:59] sorry I have been praying that he would
[1:21:02] live up to my expectations Lord here he
[1:21:07] is and then she left it there this is
[1:21:11] after years and years of praying for him
[1:21:14] she finally surrendered she was the one
[1:21:17] that was fighting against God God had a
[1:21:19] plan but our our prayers and our way
[1:21:25] hinder his plan we put him there we put
[1:21:29] our loved ones there whatever the
[1:21:30] situation is and say Lord now you have
[1:21:32] your way and right when she did that the
[1:21:35] most amazing thing started
[1:21:37] happening she started started
[1:21:41] noticing him
[1:21:44] reading this book
[1:21:46] more not by anything she
[1:21:49] did except for that
[1:21:51] prayer then he started coming to church
[1:21:56] more and
[1:21:58] then he met a good Christian
[1:22:02] girl married
[1:22:03] her and
[1:22:05] now everything is
[1:22:08] wonderful but she had it in her mind I
[1:22:11] want it to be like
[1:22:13] this but God didn't want it like that
[1:22:16] God wanted to surrender he said just lay
[1:22:18] it just give it to me come unto me all
[1:22:21] ye that labor and are heavy laden and I
[1:22:23] will give you rest
[1:22:26] just give it to
[1:22:28] him the Apostle
[1:22:30] Paul he was I he was his name was Saul
[1:22:36] of Tarsus back then you think he wasn't
[1:22:38] praying when he was persecuting the
[1:22:41] Christians he was up in the San hadin
[1:22:44] Council he was a highlevel person you
[1:22:47] think that he wasn't praying you think
[1:22:50] that he wasn't reading through the
[1:22:53] scriptures and yet going after God's
[1:22:57] people and cons consenting to their
[1:23:01] deaths he had the papers in his hand
[1:23:03] from the Sanhedrin Council he was going
[1:23:06] there to Damascus and he's going to
[1:23:09] arrest these Christians and probably
[1:23:12] praying the whole
[1:23:13] time and then God by his Mercy because
[1:23:18] he saw that Saul was
[1:23:21] sincere God by his Mercy comes down says
[1:23:24] Saul Saul why persecutest thou
[1:23:28] me and he's like whoa Lord who are you
[1:23:33] and he said I am
[1:23:35] Jesus I am that I am that was in the
[1:23:38] wilderness I am that Jehovah that was
[1:23:42] there I am That shikina Glory I
[1:23:45] manifested myself in this man Jesus
[1:23:48] Christ and you're persecuting
[1:23:51] me let's go back to
[1:23:53] Hebrews 1 verse four being made so much
[1:23:58] better than the angels as Heath by
[1:24:00] inheritance obtained a more excellent
[1:24:02] Name than they For unto which of the
[1:24:04] Angels said he at any time Thou Art my
[1:24:06] son this day i' I have begotten the have
[1:24:09] I begotten thee and again I will be to
[1:24:12] him a father and he shall be to me a
[1:24:14] son the author is quoting scripture
[1:24:16] after scripture after scripture by the
[1:24:18] way and again when he bringeth in the
[1:24:21] first begotten into the world he saith
[1:24:23] and let all the angels of God worship
[1:24:26] him this man far
[1:24:29] exceeds what you think he's he is let's
[1:24:33] go to chapter two
[1:24:35] now
[1:24:38] therefore we ought to give the more
[1:24:41] Earnest heed to the things which we have
[1:24:44] heard lest at any time we let them slip
[1:24:47] so it's it's not just being spiritual as
[1:24:50] I was talking about or believing that
[1:24:52] there is a God or saying that you're a
[1:24:53] Christian or believer or that you attend
[1:24:57] church the people reading this letter
[1:24:59] brothers and sisters were Hebrews that
[1:25:01] had already accepted Jesus
[1:25:04] Christ this isn't to a new believer this
[1:25:07] isn't to someone that didn't know Christ
[1:25:10] this is to Christians Messianic Jews
[1:25:12] ones that had accepted Christ they had
[1:25:15] probably been baptized they were
[1:25:17] attending church but sometimes we let
[1:25:19] things become common to
[1:25:21] us in the United States we can worship
[1:25:24] as we please we can come to church and
[1:25:26] we can stay
[1:25:28] home there's many
[1:25:30] freedoms that we have and really they
[1:25:33] become common to us say oh well I'll go
[1:25:36] to church this morning or yeah I'm gonna
[1:25:40] I'm gonna skip here and I I'll go there
[1:25:46] um and it becomes common to us we don't
[1:25:48] appreciate
[1:25:49] it so what does it mean to say I'm a
[1:25:51] Christian we always want to convert
[1:25:53] brother and sister we always want to
[1:25:54] convert someone to our way of thinking
[1:25:57] we always say that you have to accept
[1:26:02] Jesus but there's always a plus sign we
[1:26:05] always want something more and that's
[1:26:08] why we don't see the converts that we we
[1:26:10] should that's why it doesn't work
[1:26:12] because it's always Jesus plus something
[1:26:16] instead of Christ plus something that
[1:26:21] plus should be put first and say here
[1:26:26] this will help you come to Christ not
[1:26:29] now you've accept Jesus now you want
[1:26:31] something higher there is nothing higher
[1:26:32] than Jesus Christ remember he's God
[1:26:35] there's nothing higher than
[1:26:36] that there's if you're coming to Tucson
[1:26:41] I've used this analogy before if you're
[1:26:43] coming to Tucson and Tucson is your
[1:26:45] ultimate destination there are many
[1:26:48] roads that get to
[1:26:50] Tucson there's a road from Phoenix
[1:26:52] there's a road from Yuma there's there's
[1:26:54] a road from nogalus there's a road from
[1:26:56] Los cruus and all of these roads come to
[1:27:00] the same place and that's with Christ
[1:27:02] however whatever Road you're on make
[1:27:05] sure that that road is going to Jesus
[1:27:07] and don't get off on an exit Jesus plus
[1:27:10] something stay on that
[1:27:12] Highway and as long as the destination
[1:27:15] on that highway is Jesus Christ and
[1:27:19] knowing him and having that relationship
[1:27:23] with him
[1:27:24] then you're on the right
[1:27:26] Road you don't have to take a detour
[1:27:30] around coming from Interstate 8 and come
[1:27:35] in on a from another
[1:27:37] Direction just stay on the
[1:27:45] path
[1:27:48] and Jesus is that bridge you know
[1:27:51] there's a there's there's there's the
[1:27:54] ultimate destination which is the father
[1:27:56] and eternal life and and here is this
[1:27:58] bridge and we come across that bridge
[1:28:01] and you have to come through Jesus
[1:28:03] Christ and it's a toll bridge it's a
[1:28:05] toll road it requires a fair to be paid
[1:28:10] and as you're driving on you're getting
[1:28:11] to that destination as you're driving on
[1:28:13] you can just wave your hand and say my
[1:28:15] toll has been
[1:28:16] paid it was paid before me I come in the
[1:28:20] name of Jesus Christ and they say come
[1:28:22] on through
[1:28:24] because he's the only one that could pay
[1:28:26] the toll you might
[1:28:30] say
[1:28:31] brother we're already Christians in this
[1:28:34] room all of us here are Christians why
[1:28:38] are you always preaching Jesus to
[1:28:41] us the people reading as I said the
[1:28:44] people reading this letter to the
[1:28:45] Hebrews they were Christians
[1:28:48] too they were people they were Jews that
[1:28:51] had made a stand for Jesus Christ and
[1:28:53] they were in danger danger of their
[1:28:55] lives because of that stand which we're
[1:28:58] not the people that are receiving this
[1:29:00] letter they were they could have been
[1:29:02] killed for what they believed they were
[1:29:04] willing to sacrifice everything they
[1:29:07] were real Christians and yet the author
[1:29:11] is telling them more about
[1:29:18] Jesus therefore we ought to give the
[1:29:21] most Earnest
[1:29:23] heed to the things which we have heard
[1:29:26] lest at any time we should let them slip
[1:29:29] for if the word spoken by Angels was
[1:29:32] steadfast in every transgression and
[1:29:35] Disobedience received a just recompense
[1:29:38] of reward so the prophets and the
[1:29:40] ministers they brought the word in every
[1:29:43] transgression and Disobedience received
[1:29:46] punishment they didn't
[1:29:48] Escape we've gone through a good portion
[1:29:50] of the Old Testament in our Wednesday
[1:29:52] night bible study and we see that when
[1:29:54] the people sinned they were punished
[1:29:57] when the world fell into sin and
[1:29:59] violence and immorality with Noah God
[1:30:02] drowned
[1:30:03] them with Sodom when they came into
[1:30:06] sexual immorality God burned
[1:30:10] them when
[1:30:12] Judah had their sins Babylon came
[1:30:18] in took the king took his sons
[1:30:22] Nebuchadnezzar we you know the story we'
[1:30:24] we' talked about 2 Chronicles and second
[1:30:28] Kings Babylon came
[1:30:30] in
[1:30:32] killed the sons of the king said look
[1:30:36] watch killed the sons of the king then
[1:30:38] gouged his eyes out so that would be the
[1:30:40] last thing that he ever
[1:30:41] saw they were punished for their
[1:30:45] immorality and they received a just
[1:30:47] recompense of reward then how shall we
[1:30:50] escape if we neglect so great salvation
[1:30:53] which at the first began to be spoken by
[1:30:55] the Lord and was confirmed unto us by
[1:30:57] them that heard him God also bearing
[1:31:00] them witness both with signs and wonders
[1:31:03] and with diverse Miracles and Gifts of
[1:31:05] the Holy Ghost according to his own will
[1:31:08] For unto the Angels hath he not put in
[1:31:12] subjection the world to come whereof we
[1:31:14] speak now he's going to quote another
[1:31:16] Old Testament prophecy about the
[1:31:19] Messiah but one in a certain place
[1:31:22] testifieth saying what what is man that
[1:31:25] thou art mindful of him or the son of
[1:31:27] man that thou visit him thou mest him a
[1:31:30] little lower than the Angels then
[1:31:32] crownest him with the glory and honor
[1:31:35] and did set him over the works of thy
[1:31:37] hands thou Hast put all things in
[1:31:40] subjection under his feet for in that he
[1:31:42] put all in subjection under him he left
[1:31:45] nothing that is not put under him but
[1:31:47] now we see not yet all things put under
[1:31:50] him it's a little hard to understand so
[1:31:52] I'm going to read the English Standard
[1:31:53] Version verse six brother Jordan or um
[1:31:56] Brothers if you could go back to verse
[1:31:58] six this is the English Standard Version
[1:32:01] it has been testified somewhere again
[1:32:04] the author wasn't able to look it up
[1:32:06] like we can't it has been testified some
[1:32:09] he's quoting Psalm 8 uh
[1:32:14] 4-6 has been testified somewhere what is
[1:32:16] man that you are mindful in of him or
[1:32:18] the son of man that you care for him you
[1:32:21] made him for a little while
[1:32:24] lower than the Angels you have crowned
[1:32:26] him with Glory and Honor putting
[1:32:28] everything in subjection under his feet
[1:32:31] now in putting everything in subjection
[1:32:33] to him he left nothing outside his
[1:32:35] control at present we do not yet see
[1:32:39] everything subjection in subjection to
[1:32:41] him so there's more there's still more
[1:32:44] work to do and we don't see these things
[1:32:47] now but we will see them in time to come
[1:32:50] Philippians says that he says therefore
[1:32:52] God hath highly exalted him and bestowed
[1:32:54] on him the name that is above every name
[1:32:56] so that the name of Jesus every knee
[1:32:58] should bow in heaven and on Earth and
[1:33:01] under the Earth and every tongue confess
[1:33:03] that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory
[1:33:06] of the
[1:33:09] father Jesus is Lord to the glory of the
[1:33:13] father but we verse number nine but we
[1:33:16] see Jesus who was made a little lower
[1:33:18] than the angels for the suffering of
[1:33:20] death crowned with Glory and Honor that
[1:33:22] he by the grace of God should taste
[1:33:25] death for every
[1:33:27] man so God in his power and His glory
[1:33:30] was able to Humble himself and become a
[1:33:34] man so that he could suffer like we
[1:33:36] suffer so that he could taste death like
[1:33:39] we taste
[1:33:40] death how can brothers and sisters how
[1:33:43] how could a father how could
[1:33:46] someone stand for us or relate to us if
[1:33:49] they' never been through
[1:33:51] it you can't you might have a
[1:33:55] problem and if I've never experienced
[1:33:58] anything like that how could I relate to
[1:34:01] it I can't I can imagine and I can I can
[1:34:05] try to
[1:34:07] help but I don't really know that's why
[1:34:10] Jesus had to be born from a woman he had
[1:34:12] to suffer hunger and sickness he had to
[1:34:15] suffer from his his friends forsaking
[1:34:18] him he had to suffer from rumors being
[1:34:20] spread about him he had to suffer
[1:34:24] all of the things that we suffer he had
[1:34:27] to suffer he had to feel Temptation like
[1:34:29] we feel
[1:34:31] temptation but he was tempted and higher
[1:34:34] than any of
[1:34:35] us because Satan knew that he was a Son
[1:34:38] of God but yet he was without
[1:34:42] sin he overcame where no Prophet No
[1:34:46] Angel no being has ever been he overcame
[1:34:50] or they couldn't overcome for it became
[1:34:53] him
[1:34:54] for whom are all things and by whom are
[1:34:56] all things in bringing many sons unto
[1:34:59] glory to make the captain of their
[1:35:02] salvation perfect through
[1:35:05] sufferings we can all come into Glory
[1:35:10] because of this
[1:35:11] man and even he was perfected by
[1:35:16] suffering so he can know how it is to
[1:35:19] suffer as I said
[1:35:21] and for both he that sanctifieth and
[1:35:25] they who are Sanctified are all of
[1:35:27] one for one for which one
[1:35:32] caused which CA which cause he is not
[1:35:34] ashamed to call them Brethren so the
[1:35:36] author is saying here that both Christ
[1:35:38] who cleansed us and those who are
[1:35:41] cleansed have the same father mean
[1:35:44] because we have the same father as Jesus
[1:35:46] he considers us his Brethren so do you
[1:35:49] see the spirit of Joseph here in the
[1:35:52] Bible go go back to Genesis remember our
[1:35:55] Bible study and we see Joseph and how
[1:35:58] Joseph was forsaken by his Brethren and
[1:36:01] then they didn't know who he was and all
[1:36:04] of his Brethren come in to the palace
[1:36:07] and and Joseph's like he's right under
[1:36:10] the king and they come in they don't
[1:36:12] recognize him and they had forsaken him
[1:36:14] and Joseph was not ashamed of
[1:36:17] them he still called them Brethren he
[1:36:19] still loved them because they had the
[1:36:22] same father
[1:36:25] Father and Jesus and here the author is
[1:36:29] saying that we have the same father so
[1:36:33] Jesus calls us his Brethren remember the
[1:36:36] audience is
[1:36:38] Hebrews this is a Jewish way of
[1:36:41] thinking saying I will declare thy name
[1:36:44] unto my brethren in the midst of the
[1:36:46] church I will sing praises under thee
[1:36:48] and he quotes more scriptures and again
[1:36:50] I will put my trust in him and again
[1:36:52] behold I and the children
[1:36:54] which God hath given me for as much then
[1:36:56] as the children are partakers of Flesh
[1:36:58] and Blood he also himself likewise took
[1:37:01] part of the same that through death he
[1:37:04] might destroy him that had the power of
[1:37:07] death that is the
[1:37:10] devil and deliver them who through fear
[1:37:13] of death were all their lifetime subject
[1:37:16] to bondage for
[1:37:18] verily he took not on him the nature of
[1:37:22] angels but he took on him the Seed of
[1:37:27] Abraham the Seed of Abraham remember he
[1:37:30] came he's a lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:37:33] that
[1:37:34] lineage comes from Abraham his mother
[1:37:39] Mary came from the line of Judah his
[1:37:42] stepfather Joseph came from that line of
[1:37:46] of Judah and we will get to later on in
[1:37:50] the book we'll get to that no priest
[1:37:52] ever came from Judah they all came from
[1:37:55] Levi but this man was
[1:37:58] different and there's
[1:38:00] more the Apostle Paul and this is where
[1:38:03] it hits right home with us so we're
[1:38:06] talking about these Jewish people we're
[1:38:07] talking about this Jewish Heritage
[1:38:09] coming down through this line of
[1:38:11] Judah but the Apostle Paul put us right
[1:38:15] in there Galatians chapter 3:
[1:38:19] 23 but before Faith came we were kept
[1:38:22] under the law shut up under the faith
[1:38:26] which should afterwards be revealed
[1:38:28] wherefore the law was our school Master
[1:38:30] to bring us under Christ that we might
[1:38:32] be justified by faith he's talking about
[1:38:36] the writings of Moses he's talking about
[1:38:38] the law the Torah but after that faith
[1:38:42] is come we are no longer under a school
[1:38:44] Master for ye are the children of God by
[1:38:47] faith in Jesus
[1:38:49] Christ so there's no more just the he
[1:38:53] Hebrew race following the law brought by
[1:38:55] Moses for as many of you as have been
[1:38:58] baptized into Christ have put on Christ
[1:39:01] that there is neither Jew nor Greek
[1:39:04] there is neither Bond nor free there is
[1:39:07] neither male nor female for you are all
[1:39:10] one in Christ Jesus as I mentioned
[1:39:12] earlier you look at that your race
[1:39:14] doesn't matter your gender doesn't
[1:39:16] matter your social standing doesn't
[1:39:18] matter your denomination or your church
[1:39:20] doesn't matter you are all one if you
[1:39:23] you have accepted Christ as your savior
[1:39:26] and if you be Christ's then you are
[1:39:28] Abraham's seed and HS according to the
[1:39:31] promise so now us
[1:39:34] Gentiles we are put inside of that line
[1:39:39] and we have the same rights as the sons
[1:39:42] of Abraham had we are adopted it says in
[1:39:46] Ephesians we are grafted in however you
[1:39:49] want to say it we are part of this
[1:39:51] lineage because we believed Jesus Christ
[1:39:54] and now we are sons of
[1:40:01] Abraham let's go back
[1:40:04] to Hebrews
[1:40:09] 2:17 wherefore in all things it behooved
[1:40:13] him to be made like unto his Brethren
[1:40:17] that he might be a merciful and faithful
[1:40:19] high priest in things pertaining to God
[1:40:22] to make reconciliation for the sins of
[1:40:25] the people let's break that scripture
[1:40:27] down quickly it says therefore it was
[1:40:31] essential that he had to be made like us
[1:40:34] his brothers Mankind in every respect so
[1:40:37] that he was born into the world he was
[1:40:39] crying like a baby he got cold he got
[1:40:41] sick people picked on him he tripped and
[1:40:44] he fell and he skinned his knee he he
[1:40:47] did everything that a a a young man or a
[1:40:49] baby or a teenager he was part of it all
[1:40:55] that he might be a merciful and faithful
[1:40:57] high priest in the things pertaining to
[1:40:59] God he experienced these things but he
[1:41:01] didn't
[1:41:03] sin but he was he experienced them and
[1:41:07] he understood have you ever gotten
[1:41:10] advice from a minister or or from from
[1:41:14] someone else that they're going to tell
[1:41:17] you well if you're having problems with
[1:41:19] your wife or if you're having problems
[1:41:20] with your husband well just just say
[1:41:22] this just tell him that or or you need
[1:41:25] to put the you need to lay down the law
[1:41:26] brother and you're you're the head of
[1:41:27] the family it's like wait wait wait you
[1:41:30] don't
[1:41:31] know or if somebody if there's an
[1:41:34] addictive
[1:41:35] personality someone that is a drinker or
[1:41:38] someone that gets gets hooked on
[1:41:42] drugs I wouldn't know how it
[1:41:45] is he might say brother you don't
[1:41:50] understand but Jesus does understand he
[1:41:53] is someone that can be touched he does
[1:41:56] he understands the things that we go
[1:42:00] through or you can say that well my my
[1:42:05] kids are sinning or or my sister my
[1:42:08] brother my wife my
[1:42:10] husband and I might not not know how it
[1:42:12] is but Jesus always does and he's there
[1:42:17] as the Bible says to be touched in all
[1:42:20] things it behooved him to be made like
[1:42:22] us so that he might be a merciful and
[1:42:25] faithful high priest so what does it
[1:42:26] mean to be a high priest the high priest
[1:42:30] was the highest ranking person in the
[1:42:33] church in the Jewish church he was he
[1:42:36] was the main guy and what he did is he
[1:42:38] made an atonement for the people he went
[1:42:41] in and he sacrificed once a year
[1:42:43] remember he went into the holy of holies
[1:42:45] once a year and the co the the glory of
[1:42:47] God would come down the priest would
[1:42:49] make these
[1:42:51] sacrifices for the sins of the people
[1:42:55] and that was that was the high priest
[1:42:58] that was his job and a high priest when
[1:43:02] he was raised to that level of the high
[1:43:04] priest he was not only judged by his
[1:43:06] knowledge of the Bible he was also
[1:43:08] judged by the life that he led he
[1:43:10] couldn't have a spot on his record his
[1:43:12] parents were probably Rich he probably
[1:43:14] came from an affluent family he lived a
[1:43:16] legalistic life and was probably never
[1:43:18] accused of doing anything wrong because
[1:43:20] of his standing
[1:43:23] and how can that person relate to most
[1:43:27] of
[1:43:28] us he was doing his
[1:43:32] job but he didn't understand how it was
[1:43:37] but Jesus understands it as I said
[1:43:40] without sin he never did anything wrong
[1:43:42] but he was still the devil came against
[1:43:47] him let's
[1:43:49] uh let's close verse number 18
[1:43:54] for in that he himself hath suffered
[1:43:57] being tempted he is able to sucker them
[1:43:59] that are tempted he was able to help
[1:44:02] them that are tempted um the musicians
[1:44:04] can
[1:44:05] come this is one of the most beautiful
[1:44:07] things I've ever read in the whole
[1:44:11] Bible that because Jesus went through it
[1:44:16] you can say as many of the young people
[1:44:19] that they'll they'll tell their parents
[1:44:20] you know you just don't understand you
[1:44:22] don't get it
[1:44:23] and we don't sometimes I know I
[1:44:25] certainly don't and some of the things
[1:44:27] that I hear but he gets it he
[1:44:31] understands he's he's been
[1:44:33] there he's suffered he's felt these
[1:44:36] Temptations and he showed us that no you
[1:44:39] can you can
[1:44:44] overcome well I wanted to get to Hebrews
[1:44:46] 3 but I won't
[1:44:49] um this book of Hebrews
[1:44:52] [Music]
[1:44:54] it was written to a Hebrew audience that
[1:45:00] were already Christians they had already
[1:45:03] given their lives to the Lord and here
[1:45:05] comes this book and it is telling the
[1:45:09] people that know this man wasn't just a
[1:45:12] prophet he wasn't just a priest he
[1:45:15] wasn't just an angel he was better than
[1:45:19] all of that
[1:45:23] and in saying that to our people
[1:45:27] today don't neglect to lift Jesus up and
[1:45:33] no you don't have to
[1:45:35] come in a certain way or in a certain
[1:45:39] fashion the ultimate goal is Jesus
[1:45:42] Christ he
[1:45:44] was he was everything and he gets it he
[1:45:50] understands I don't know how I don't
[1:45:52] know how to say it any better brothers
[1:45:53] and sisters we can touch
[1:45:55] him we can we can get on our knees and
[1:45:59] we can pray and we can say Lord I need
[1:46:02] help and he will hear
[1:46:05] us no one
[1:46:07] else can do what he did no one else
[1:46:10] understands how he understands that's
[1:46:13] why it is so important that we have that
[1:46:16] relationship between me and him and not
[1:46:20] anyone in
[1:46:21] between between you you and him and
[1:46:25] that's what this book of Hebrews is
[1:46:27] saying listen he is a high priest he is
[1:46:30] God
[1:46:31] himself he was our
[1:46:34] savior he was our King he is our King he
[1:46:37] is our savior he's
[1:46:41] God and he can be touched we can talk to
[1:46:44] him he understands
[1:46:47] us just like the sister she was fighting
[1:46:50] against God and she was saying Lord help
[1:46:53] my son to get to church help him to find
[1:46:56] a girl help him to read his Bible help
[1:46:57] him to do this and this and this and
[1:46:59] this and God was there he was like if
[1:47:02] you will just give it to
[1:47:04] me then I'll take care of
[1:47:08] it God can give us a
[1:47:14] promise but unless we accept that
[1:47:17] promise it'll never happen he promised
[1:47:20] eternal life
[1:47:23] to anyone who would accept him he
[1:47:25] promised healing to everyone he promised
[1:47:28] all of these things yet how many how
[1:47:30] come so many people don't get healed how
[1:47:32] come so many people don't get saved how
[1:47:34] come so many people don't have don't
[1:47:36] receive what is promised he promised it
[1:47:40] why can't we receive it it's because we
[1:47:43] got to do it our
[1:47:45] way and if we would just
[1:47:47] surrender and give it to him then we
[1:47:49] would have the same results as we see in
[1:47:51] the book and we would have the same
[1:47:54] results as a
[1:47:55] sister that was praying for her son give
[1:47:58] it to him he understands he gets it we
[1:48:03] might not but he
[1:48:05] does brother
[1:48:07] [Music]
[1:48:09] Josiah All to
[1:48:13] Jesus
[1:48:14] I
[1:48:17] surrender
[1:48:19] all to him I
[1:48:24] freely
[1:48:26] give I will
[1:48:30] ever
[1:48:32] love and trust him
[1:48:36] in his
[1:48:39] pray stay
[1:48:44] here I
[1:48:48] surrender all
[1:48:54] I

[1:49:00] all all to thee my
[1:49:07] blessed save your
[1:49:11] I
[1:49:13] surrender
[1:49:16] all oh All to Jesus
[1:49:23] I
[1:49:26] Surrender
[1:49:28] humbly At His Feet I
[1:49:34] bow
[1:49:36] worldly
[1:49:38] pleasures
[1:49:40] all
[1:49:43] forsaken take me
[1:49:47] Jesus take me
[1:49:51] now I I
[1:49:55] surrender
[1:49:58] all oh I
[1:50:02] [Music]

[1:50:07] all all to thee my
[1:50:13] blessed
[1:50:15] savior I
[1:50:20] surrender all
[1:50:22] [Music]
[1:50:26] therefore we ought to give the more
[1:50:28] Earnest heed to the things which we have
[1:50:31] learned which we have
[1:50:33] heard lest at any time we should let
[1:50:37] them slip for the word spoken by Angels
[1:50:39] was
[1:50:41] steadfast and every transgression and
[1:50:43] Disobedience received a just recompense
[1:50:46] of
[1:50:47] reward how shall we escape if we neglect
[1:50:51] so great Sal salvation which at the
[1:50:54] first began to be spoken by the Lord and
[1:50:56] was confirmed unto us by them that heard
[1:51:00] him God also bearing them witness with
[1:51:03] both signs and wonders in diverse
[1:51:05] Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost
[1:51:08] according to his own
[1:51:12] will we can't escape if we neglect this
[1:51:16] salvation that has been given to us it
[1:51:18] should be everything to us we should
[1:51:21] instead of trying to get God to change
[1:51:25] his ways to match our ways we should
[1:51:28] change our ways to match God ways and
[1:51:31] God's ways and the only way that we can
[1:51:34] do that is to get on our knees and to
[1:51:38] surrender to God and say
[1:51:42] Lord I don't
[1:51:44] care you just tell me what to do you
[1:51:48] just show me you just lead me Lord and I
[1:51:51] will do what ever you say that is what
[1:51:55] it is to be a Christian it's not just
[1:51:57] confessing Christ it's confessing Christ
[1:52:00] with your mouth and then confessing
[1:52:03] Christ with your actions and giving your
[1:52:05] lives to him let's all
[1:52:07] [Music]
[1:52:11] stand I claim the
[1:52:15] blood I have a

[2:00:17] a privilege it is to come before you in
[2:00:20] the name of Jesus Christ name that is
[2:00:23] above every names Lord we would have no
[2:00:26] Approach at all if you had not provided
[2:00:28] that for
[2:00:30] us now to be called Sons and
[2:00:33] Daughters not just m merely people that
[2:00:36] populate your kingdom but Sons and
[2:00:38] Daughters part of the royal family what
[2:00:41] great and precious promises have been
[2:00:43] placed before us hard for us perhaps to
[2:00:45] reach with our our minds to reach up
[2:00:48] that high as the pastor has tried to
[2:00:51] break it down found for us the calling
[2:00:54] that you've placed before us Lord may we
[2:00:57] just Ponder these things let it soak
[2:00:59] into our
[2:01:00] hearts the great apostle that wrote this
[2:01:02] book of
[2:01:04] Hebrews I know I can almost sense
[2:01:06] Through the Ages that he is struggling
[2:01:08] with his audience to to get them to
[2:01:11] understand the calling that's before
[2:01:12] them Lord so now we're reaching back
[2:01:15] through the time and through the history
[2:01:17] but your Holy Ghost is here Lord to
[2:01:19] illuminate those things to us maybe just
[2:01:22] a little word maybe a phrase just a turn
[2:01:24] of a phrase in a scripture that we
[2:01:26] haven't quite seen it that way before
[2:01:29] the Holy Ghost is there and here to
[2:01:32] illuminate those these things to us I
[2:01:34] pray that you do that for each heart and
[2:01:37] as we continue to to probe this great
[2:01:40] book of Hebrews Lord just loaded and
[2:01:42] packed with truth and with promises
[2:01:45] maybe they're they're just a treasure
[2:01:47] chest full of jewels May a jewel go to
[2:01:49] each person Lord that's just perfect for
[2:01:52] them that will bring them along in their
[2:01:54] faith
