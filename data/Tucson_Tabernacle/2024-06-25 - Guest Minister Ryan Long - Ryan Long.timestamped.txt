[32:56] tonight um this
[32:59] morning good friend of mine brother Ryan
[33:03] first time I ever heard him speak was um
[33:06] was at a Minister's meeting up in
[33:09] Phoenix and the brother struck
[33:12] me as having a very very good
[33:16] understanding of this
[33:17] book and the thing that I appreciate and
[33:20] I've said this before and I I said it
[33:22] last weekend about brother Ryan the
[33:23] thing I appreciate brother Ryan is I
[33:26] don't believe that his understanding of
[33:28] this book is in any way
[33:31] swayed by any type of a narrative or any
[33:35] type of a u trying to fit the mold of a
[33:40] certain type of preacher and I think
[33:43] that's why brother Ryan is such a
[33:44] blessing is because he is going straight
[33:48] to the author amen and he is blessing us
[33:52] with his understanding and with his
[33:53] revelation of this word so let's stand
[33:59] as I introduce my friend brother Ryan
[34:03] brother

[40:07] maybe even come in the doors you ever
[40:09] gone through that
[40:10] before I might be the only one brother
[40:12] Dan you ever feel like you're not worthy
[40:15] to even walk in the doors of a church
[40:17] because of something you thought
[40:18] something you did something you
[40:20] said that's just the devil trying to
[40:23] keep you right from a change from
[40:25] deliverance from something to take that
[40:28] that thought or whatever it might be
[40:29] from you and set it aside and and I I'm
[40:33] I'm so glad that you came this morning
[40:35] maybe despite what you have going on
[40:36] maybe despite what you feel you came

[40:41] here despite what I felt despite what I
[40:43] think and and I'm counting on the Lord
[40:47] as much as you are counting on the Lord
[40:49] maybe a little bit more maybe just I
[40:51] think a little bit
[40:53] more and I appreciate brother Dan as
[40:56] always is definitely definitely a true
[40:58] friend um just appreciate and love the
[41:01] people here in Tucson um so good to be

[41:06] always brother Dan um to those that that
[41:09] put in all the work last night I know
[41:11] you're standing a little bit and if
[41:12] that's okay I just want to take the time
[41:14] to thank those that that put in time
[41:16] yesterday set up the sound set up uh the
[41:20] the electrical the those that were
[41:22] practicing here for the last few days um
[41:25] the sisters and and that put it together
[41:27] the food and serve that it you know
[41:30] maybe somebody may not notice it but God
[41:32] notices
[41:33] it and I certainly notice it and I want
[41:35] to say thank you for that effort it it
[41:37] it just means so much and you just never
[41:39] know what a little action might do for
[41:41] somebody you know somebody might just
[41:43] come off the street and hear something
[41:45] and it it didn't come from a preacher
[41:47] right I say that again it didn't come
[41:49] from a preacher it came from a
[41:52] Believer but I'll tell you this you are
[41:55] all able-bodied men
[41:57] ministers you are all Ministers of the
[42:00] Gospel you may not stand behind this
[42:02] little 3-ft section of wood right here
[42:05] but you're a minister correct and what I
[42:07] saw last night was a Ministry I just
[42:09] wanted to say thank you I appreciate it
[42:10] it it was definitely a blessing and I
[42:12] hope that you continue it uh we'll read
[42:14] a scripture I know you've been standing
[42:16] for a little bit
[42:17] and um I just wanted to settle my nerves
[42:20] a little bit um you know just I I would
[42:23] ask you to say a little extra prayer for
[42:25] me this morning
[42:27] Lord just take these uh this nervousness
[42:30] away give me the right words to say that
[42:32] are his words you know I have notes and
[42:35] have scriptures but brother Dan as you
[42:37] know you just come up and you say Lord I
[42:39] want to surrender even these notes that
[42:40] I have even these scriptures to you may
[42:43] you just say what you want to say this
[42:44] morning let's turn to Matthew and we'll
[42:47] just move forward and trust in the Lord
[42:49] this morning how many how many came to
[42:52] receive something this morning all right
[42:54] so that's the best sign I could ask for
[42:55] right there because then I don't have
[42:57] anything to do with
[42:59] it I don't have anything to do with it
[43:02] the Lord's GNA use whatever instrument
[43:04] or whatever speaker he wants to to get
[43:06] to you if you have an expectation and if
[43:08] you have an expectation strong enough to
[43:09] raise your hand you say it's just
[43:11] raising my hand well the word says that
[43:13] that could be the difference between you
[43:14] going to heaven and going to hell it's
[43:17] just raising your hand up because you
[43:19] know what it is it's the song we just
[43:21] sing it's a lord I Surrender and I'm
[43:23] going to show you that I
[43:25] Surrender and that's what I got have to
[43:27] do as a minister that's what you have to
[43:28] do is sit and where you're at if we do
[43:30] that there is no telling what God could
[43:33] do in our presence today on there there
[43:36] there is not a soul that's low enough
[43:38] that he can't pull up to literally say
[43:41] you will be with me in Paradise
[43:43] today and and I'm that Soul I'm that
[43:48] Soul let's turn to Matthew
[43:50] 5 this is uh I I just I don't want to
[43:53] talk to you about anything new this
[43:55] morning I don't have anything new I just
[43:56] have what the Lord put on my heart it's
[43:59] it's a scripture I think I mean I think
[44:01] there's people who recite this scripture
[44:03] maybe don't even know it's from the
[44:04] Bible but I but I still want to read
[44:07] this scripture because it's what the
[44:08] Lord put on my heart this morning
[44:10] Matthew
[44:11] 5:13 Jesus is preaching a Sermon on the
[44:14] Mount maybe the most famous sermon ever
[44:16] preached and in the middle of it he says
[44:18] you ye are the salt of the
[44:22] earth and I want to tell you this
[44:24] morning that if Jesus was standing here
[44:27] preaching to you he would tell you you
[44:30] are the salt of the earth correct amen
[44:33] and and I don't I don't want to I don't
[44:34] want to break this down too much but it
[44:36] does not say you will become the salt of
[44:39] the earth brother
[44:41] Daniel I want you to try to be the salt
[44:44] of the earth this morning that's not
[44:45] what it says it says you are present
[44:49] tense the salt of the
[44:51] earth but if the salt have lost his
[44:54] Savor wherewith shall it be salted what
[44:57] a question it is thenceforth good for
[45:00] nothing to be cast out and be trodden
[45:02] Under Foot of man and I want you to
[45:04] notice this next to me he says you are
[45:06] the light of the
[45:08] world now now think about this Jesus
[45:12] himself God in flesh is standing before
[45:16] a multitude of people and and brother
[45:19] Dan I would expect him to say now I am
[45:22] the light of the
[45:23] world but Jesus instead under in
[45:27] insiration says you are the light of the
[45:31] world while he yet stood there before
[45:34] them and maybe that's just you say well
[45:36] that's just the way it was written if we
[45:38] could just grab a hold of how Jesus was
[45:42] thinking and what he meant by that I
[45:43] think it would change our lives you are
[45:46] the light of the world a city that is
[45:49] set on a hill and cannot be hid neither
[45:52] do men light a candle and put it under a
[45:54] bushel but on a Candlestick and it
[45:56] giveth light unto all that are in the
[45:58] house let your light so shine before
[46:03] men that they may see your good works
[46:06] and glorify your father which is in
[46:08] heaven you may be seated I I just love
[46:10] to take these little scriptures and I
[46:12] just read past them I'll just be honest
[46:14] sometimes I just read right over them
[46:15] brother Aaron and and and you know
[46:18] somebody else will read it and I thought
[46:19] I didn't even know it said it that way
[46:21] if I just we just take the time and slow
[46:23] down and examine each one of these words
[46:25] he says let your light shine amen okay I
[46:30] I I just I just want to start with this
[46:32] do you believe that that these words
[46:34] that we just read come from
[46:37] God right that there's no trick question
[46:40] not right here do they come from God
[46:44] okay is God does God know what he's
[46:45] talking about amen this is good this
[46:49] there easy questions does God lie no
[46:53] okay so when God says something does he
[46:56] mean it yes okay that's good so then do
[47:00] are you the salt of the earth that's
[47:03] good it's sometimes it's a little bit
[47:05] quieter but it's still there are you the
[47:08] light of the world do you feel like
[47:12] [Laughter]
[47:15] it
[47:16] right I mean sometimes I do sometimes I
[47:20] don't amen that's the truth for me
[47:23] sometimes I do sometimes I don't and and
[47:26] I I want to I want to go into what the
[47:28] word says because you think okay
[47:31] sometimes I do sometimes I don't I must
[47:32] be a make believer I must be a doubter I
[47:36] must be this I must be that because if I
[47:39] don't feel like it all the time there
[47:40] must be something
[47:42] wrong
[47:44] right but does God
[47:47] lie does God know what he's talking
[47:49] about when God says something does he
[47:51] mean it yes okay then it doesn't matter
[47:54] I know this is just so so basic and
[47:56] rudimentary it doesn't matter how I feel
[48:00] if God is not a liar and God knows what
[48:02] he's talking about then I can look
[48:04] myself in the mirror and say you are
[48:06] you're you're no good you're no good but
[48:10] yet God is not a liar God knows what
[48:13] he's talking about and God said that I
[48:16] now I can't claim it for you this
[48:17] morning that something that that that
[48:20] that not even God can do for you is make
[48:23] a choice did you know that you know the
[48:27] I want to I don't want to get ahead of
[48:28] myself here but but when God asks you or
[48:30] tells you to do something in the Bible
[48:33] you know that he is there to do that for
[48:36] you we'll we'll I'll read you scripture
[48:38] for it but there's one thing that God
[48:40] cannot do for
[48:42] you and that is make a
[48:45] choice because if God could make you
[48:47] make a choice then it's not a
[48:50] choice if God could make you love him
[48:53] then you're not choosing to love
[48:55] him you're just you're just you're a
[48:57] train on a track and there's nothing you
[48:59] can do about it God puts before you a
[49:03] choice between good and evil between him
[49:07] and not him amen and we make that choice
[49:12] now when I come to that decision what
[49:14] are we going to do I think all of us
[49:17] will say well I choose
[49:18] God right I choose God but then hard
[49:22] time set in right hard time set in and
[49:25] then we start to question did I really
[49:27] choose him or even worse did he really
[49:30] choose
[49:33] me there's another scripture with this
[49:36] is similar and I just wanted to talk to
[49:39] you a little bit this morning about Salt
[49:41] and
[49:42] Light and there's a scripture this this
[49:46] this is the one I think we all know
[49:47] you're the salt of the earth but if the
[49:49] the salt has lost its Savor brother
[49:51] brother Brandon mentions this many times
[49:54] but over in Luke um and not to say that
[49:56] contradict but I just kind of like
[49:58] another perspective of this and Luke is
[50:00] talking about this same scripture if you
[50:02] want to write it down you want to turn
[50:03] to it's Luke
[50:05] 1434 and he says salt is
[50:09] good but if the salt has lost his Savor
[50:14] wherewith shall it be
[50:17] seasoned it is neither fit for the land
[50:21] nor yet for the
[50:23] dungill but Men cast it out and he says
[50:27] now if you have ears listen to what I'm
[50:30] telling
[50:31] you and and you know all the maybe the
[50:33] sermons I've heard about salt and and
[50:35] things they they talk about salt being a
[50:38] seasoning amen a seasoning that if you
[50:42] put a little bit of salt in in maybe a
[50:44] food if you put a little bit of salt in
[50:45] a situation it changes that situation
[50:48] and I believe that if you take just a
[50:50] little bit and sprinkle it here and you
[50:52] know maybe sometimes uh if you've ever
[50:54] heard a sermon on salt you you kind of
[50:56] like liken yourself to the salt and you
[50:57] say if if I just place a few Christians
[51:00] here and there it will make things
[51:02] better and that is true but there's so
[51:05] much more to what Luke is saying here
[51:07] about salt he says that if the salt lost
[51:10] its Savor that it's neither fit for the
[51:13] land or the dungill and if you really
[51:16] start to look into that and you start to
[51:18] to to study that a little bit salt has
[51:21] more uses than just a
[51:24] seasoning what they used it for in this
[51:26] time I'm I'm not a historian I won't I
[51:28] won't go into anything I probably get
[51:30] fact checked brother Dan but but you
[51:32] could look this
[51:34] up they use salt they had a they had a
[51:36] source for it the Dead
[51:38] Sea and the reason why it was so
[51:40] valuable is they actually used this salt
[51:43] as in their Gardens and in their plants
[51:46] and if you take salt I'm I'm not a
[51:48] chemist but if you take salt there's
[51:49] anybody ever heard of
[51:51] potash okay s in the Bible that is
[51:54] salt potassium chloride
[51:57] and they would use it because it
[51:59] actually promoted the growth of plants
[52:01] Hallelujah when they took salt now you
[52:03] would not think if you put salt on
[52:04] Plants it would do something but in this
[52:06] form if you took salt and you put it on
[52:09] your plants in your garden in your trees
[52:11] life would come
[52:13] forth to God gives you maybe another
[52:15] view of salt right now now what did he
[52:18] say in the first scripture you are
[52:19] what you're
[52:22] salt how many is that all right we got
[52:26] there was less hands but it was we got a
[52:27] few hands how many is salt am does God
[52:31] know what he's talking about does he lie
[52:34] okay so if he says you are the salt of
[52:36] the earth let's figure out what salt
[52:38] does and and I know I know maybe what
[52:40] you're thinking because it's the same
[52:41] thing I'm thinking brother the more you
[52:43] describe what salt does the less I feel
[52:45] like
[52:47] salt right oh salt does that too well I
[52:51] don't know if I do that but it's so
[52:53] beautiful because God doesn't say try to
[52:55] be this right you know maybe work on
[52:58] becoming salt what he's telling you is
[53:01] that you as a Believer how many can say
[53:03] you know what despite all my struggles
[53:05] despite all my doubts and despite my
[53:08] unbelief I'm a Believer that's in the
[53:11] Bible I I Lord I don't know what it is I
[53:13] I fail every day but I believe you okay
[53:17] then if you do that and you truly mean
[53:18] that then God is trying to tell you that
[53:20] you already have in you the ability to
[53:23] do this correct you already are the salt
[53:27] of the earth amen now I want you to
[53:30] notice he didn't say you were the
[53:32] Earth you are the salt of the
[53:36] earth and salt has another property it
[53:38] says here so in one sense the effect of
[53:41] salt is that it it causes life to grow
[53:47] yes and I'm not making a stretch of that
[53:49] that's literally the use for it but it
[53:51] says here it's not fit for the land if
[53:53] it lost its ability and the other thing
[53:55] it's not fit for is the D hill now you
[53:57] could say what is that for but you
[53:58] actually look up that word that is that
[54:01] is not the manure pile we're just going
[54:03] to get a we're just going to get a
[54:05] little bit country this morning that's
[54:07] that's the restroom and what they would
[54:09] do is they would take they would have a
[54:11] area where they where where the restroom
[54:13] was at and when they were when they were
[54:14] done they would take salt and they would
[54:17] spread it over that area because what
[54:19] salt did is it
[54:21] killed anything that was corrupt
[54:24] anything that was bacteria anything that
[54:26] was toxic the salt would would inhibit
[54:30] the growth of that and if salt has lost
[54:33] its Savor it's neither fit to inhibit
[54:36] the growth of something bad or to
[54:38] promote the something good does that
[54:41] make a little bit more sense now what
[54:43] it's it's salt well brother I just want
[54:44] to be I just want to be salty yes but
[54:46] what does that look like what does it
[54:49] look like to be salty what is it what is
[54:51] it actually to be the salt of the earth
[54:54] and and and if we believe that these
[54:56] words from
[54:57] God and we believe that he's saying
[54:59] something true but we don't quite feel
[55:01] like the salt and where is the problem
[55:03] at
[55:04] right and anybody that has any humility
[55:07] you would you any Speck of humility you
[55:09] would read that you are the salt of the
[55:11] earth you are the light of the world and
[55:12] if you had a little bit of humility you
[55:13] would say I just don't know if I'm in
[55:15] that place right now
[55:18] am I'm struggling with this I'm
[55:20] struggling that I'm supposed to be the
[55:21] salt I'm supposed to be the light of the
[55:23] world and yet sometimes I can't even be
[55:25] a light into my own path path wow I
[55:28] can't even see where I'm going and I'm
[55:29] supposed to be the light for somebody
[55:32] else am and what is happened when we
[55:35] have these thoughts what has happened in
[55:37] that moment when you think that it's
[55:39] because you think and I think we have
[55:42] something to do with it
[55:44] Hallelujah right there we think that
[55:47] it's because of my
[55:49] ability that I'm going to be the light
[55:51] to the world because of my ability that
[55:53] I'm going to be salty but salt is just
[55:55] salt
[55:57] it is what it is it doesn't have to try
[55:59] to be salt it doesn't have to try to be
[56:02] turn into salt it just is salt
[56:05] amen and I think the mistake that I make
[56:08] a lot of times and I don't know about
[56:09] you but the mistake I make is
[56:13] trying that's it is
[56:17] trying am I saying go do
[56:19] nothing am I saying just go out into the
[56:22] world go do whatever you feel like until
[56:24] God does something with you
[56:27] well there's people that have tried that
[56:29] in the Bible and the ones that belong to
[56:31] God got turned around real
[56:34] quick now that can happen but I'm also
[56:37] telling you that if you feel if you
[56:40] think and you believe that you are not
[56:42] doing what God is supposed to be doing
[56:45] maybe stop trying to do what God wants
[56:46] to be done and let God do
[56:49] it this song I Give Myself Away
[56:53] Hallelujah means that you don't have
[56:55] anything to do with with it Hallelujah
[56:58] it means that your ability is exactly
[57:01] what is getting in the way of God's
[57:03] ability sometimes we try to be the salt
[57:06] of the earth and just end up the Earth
[57:09] amen and and the problem can't be with
[57:11] God right does God know what he's
[57:12] talking about yeah he does know what
[57:14] he's talking about and I think sometimes
[57:16] this translate over that that we we
[57:19] think that we have to do something in
[57:21] order to receive God into our hearts now
[57:25] I know this is n just for the young
[57:26] people today but I I but I know that
[57:28] they are sitting up here
[57:30] and it's maybe it's for everybody but I
[57:33] but I want to talk to the young people
[57:36] because I want to tell you this that the
[57:38] young people today are
[57:40] special and I want to I want to read you
[57:42] something if it's okay I didn't I didn't
[57:44] really I didn't know if I wanted to read
[57:46] this or not just wanted to make sure
[57:47] that the time was right but my wife had
[57:49] sent me this years ago and I've never
[57:51] ever forgot it and I've kept it you mind
[57:54] if I just read this little thing she
[57:55] sent me
[57:57] and it's not only to you young people
[57:59] but it's to the parents that have
[58:01] children which I need to hear I I need
[58:03] to hear Brother Kurt because I'll tell
[58:05] you I'll be honest sometimes I have a
[58:08] fear for my own
[58:11] children I fear what's going to happen
[58:13] to them I fear what they're going to be
[58:14] around that's not of
[58:17] God the only reason I'm afraid is
[58:19] because I'm trying to do something out
[58:21] of my own ability for my children God
[58:24] says this don't feel sorry or fear for
[58:27] your kids because of the world they're
[58:29] going to grow up
[58:31] in now I don't know about you but I can
[58:33] look I can I can look at the world today
[58:35] and think it is so evil it is so bad
[58:40] this is 10 times worse than when I was a
[58:43] young person maybe a hundred times worse
[58:46] mostly because of
[58:48] this right it's not just the young
[58:50] people that struggle it it's adults too
[58:53] but because of this this little thing
[58:56] is oh I I can't even I don't know if
[58:58] you've ever said this I can't even
[58:59] imagine being a young person today and
[59:02] you know the truth is that's right
[59:03] because you weren't meant to be a young
[59:05] person today you know who's meant to be
[59:07] a young person today right here you can
[59:08] raise your hand you were meant to be a
[59:11] young person today in this generation
[59:14] why because you were made for it brother
[59:16] Dan I wasn't made to be young person in
[59:18] 2024 and God knows that that's why he
[59:21] had me a young person in in the '90s and
[59:23] the 80s amen but but our youth today are
[59:27] special because God made them to
[59:30] withstand The Temptations of today
[59:33] that's correct he made them to be salt
[59:36] when it seems like you cannot be salt he
[59:39] says God created and called them for the
[59:41] exact moment in time that they're
[59:45] in amen you think how am I going to I
[59:47] don't know if you think this as a young
[59:49] person how am I going to live in this I
[59:51] want you to know that God made you able
[59:54] to overcome this time when Maybe
[59:56] somebody else could not have done
[59:58] it and I want to tell you this you are
[1:00:00] the first generation that's going to
[1:00:02] overcome this
[1:00:04] age because the last generation had
[1:00:07] their age to overcome and you can glean
[1:00:09] from them and you can ask them for
[1:00:11] wisdom but you you are as the Bible says
[1:00:14] a chosen generation you are a generation
[1:00:17] that for the first time will overcome
[1:00:19] this evil
[1:00:21] age their their life it says wasn't a
[1:00:24] coincidence or an
[1:00:26] accident raise them up to know the power
[1:00:29] that they walk in as children of
[1:00:32] God train them up in the authority of
[1:00:35] his word yes amen teach them to walk in
[1:00:38] faith knowing that God is in control yes
[1:00:42] I meant to start a timer brother Dan
[1:00:44] I'll take I'll take a couple minutes off
[1:00:46] of
[1:00:47] it I know you didn't ask me
[1:00:49] to I just realized I I was meant to
[1:00:52] start when teach them to walk in faith
[1:00:54] knowing that God is in control Empower
[1:00:56] them to know that they can change the
[1:00:58] world you say I can't this world is is
[1:01:00] is lost I believe this world is lost but
[1:01:03] I I I was talking to my son maybe a week
[1:01:05] or so ago and I said I H I've had the
[1:01:06] wrong mentality for for quite a long
[1:01:09] time and the Lord corrected me through a
[1:01:12] a minister you might none of you would
[1:01:14] know him but a minister that came and
[1:01:15] spoke with us and the Lord just
[1:01:16] straightened me out I used to have the
[1:01:18] mentality of you know what this world is
[1:01:20] lost this world is doomed there's
[1:01:22] nothing we can do to save it just let it
[1:01:24] go
[1:01:26] I know that sounds awful when I repeat
[1:01:28] it to you but that's what I was thinking
[1:01:29] you know what you can't save the
[1:01:31] political world you can't save America
[1:01:33] you can't say it's turned its back on
[1:01:34] God all these things and then I got
[1:01:36] straightened out by a minister who said
[1:01:38] well we still have families that live
[1:01:41] here we still have communities that we
[1:01:43] can take we still have cities that we
[1:01:47] can take we still have states that we
[1:01:49] can take because God has not losten and
[1:01:52] I have this I have this mentality that
[1:01:54] that God just lost and not lost but you
[1:01:56] know the world is this and we have
[1:01:58] another kingdom but I live here now I
[1:02:01] live here now and I'm not going to be
[1:02:02] defeated in this world and then maybe go
[1:02:04] to the next World and I'll have Victory
[1:02:05] there we are going to be a Victorious
[1:02:07] people here I'm not going to
[1:02:10] be amen I believe that I'm not going to
[1:02:13] be the salt of the earth in heaven I'm
[1:02:16] going to be the salt of the earth
[1:02:19] here I'm not going to be the light of
[1:02:21] the world in heaven no the lamb is the
[1:02:23] light there where do I need to be the
[1:02:25] light H I need to be the light right
[1:02:27] here and there there there's there's
[1:02:29] people there's families who are
[1:02:31] struggling and they need to hear about
[1:02:34] Christ and to have this mentality that I
[1:02:37] had of well the world is just going to
[1:02:39] to Hell in a hand basket that's not the
[1:02:40] mentality of a Believer the believer has
[1:02:43] a mentality you know what I don't care
[1:02:46] if if 99.9% of the world is against me
[1:02:49] I'm going to go out and I'm going to
[1:02:50] witness about God because if I can turn
[1:02:53] just one person to him
[1:02:57] it's worth
[1:02:59] it and I'll tell you it's worth it
[1:03:01] because you were that one person corre
[1:03:05] that somebody took the time to tell you
[1:03:08] about God oh I was born in a message
[1:03:12] church so was I and I still had to hear
[1:03:14] about
[1:03:14] God I still went out and did whatever I
[1:03:17] wanted to do and still had to come to
[1:03:20] God you can change the world now this is
[1:03:23] not a a a you know a raw just get your
[1:03:26] motivation up this is the truth God
[1:03:30] knows what he's talking about God knows
[1:03:32] what he's doing and when he says it it
[1:03:34] means something amen it's not just God
[1:03:37] saying okay I'm going to Rally them up
[1:03:38] so they'll feel good no no you're going
[1:03:40] to come you're going to come to a test
[1:03:43] yes amen and God and the kind of God
[1:03:45] that I serve is going to be there in
[1:03:47] that test and say just step to the side
[1:03:50] give yourself away just a little bit and
[1:03:52] watch me go to
[1:03:54] work don't teach them to be fearful and
[1:03:57] disheartened by the state of the world
[1:03:59] but hopeful that they can do something
[1:04:01] about it every person in all of history
[1:04:05] has been placed in the time that they
[1:04:07] were because of God's Sovereign plan
[1:04:10] correct he knew now I love this now he
[1:04:13] knew Daniel could handle the Lion's Den
[1:04:16] that's correct amen oh Daniel poor
[1:04:18] Daniel he got plac no no he put him
[1:04:20] exactly where he needed to be because he
[1:04:23] equipped Daniel to be able to handle
[1:04:25] that how much more you amen how much
[1:04:28] more are you amen sometime do you feel
[1:04:32] like Daniel sometimes no not you you're
[1:04:34] actually
[1:04:35] Daniel do you feel like Daniel in the
[1:04:37] Bible sometimes do you feel like you can
[1:04:38] handle Lions
[1:04:40] Den sometimes I do sometimes I
[1:04:44] don't he knew David could handle
[1:04:48] Goliath he knew it's funny I had this
[1:04:50] down brother brother Dan he knew Esther
[1:04:52] could handle
[1:04:54] hymon you want talk about you know
[1:04:56] sometimes I think our sisters get left
[1:04:58] out a little bit right we have all these
[1:04:59] examples in the Bible but God used
[1:05:01] Esther God used Ruth God used Rahab God
[1:05:06] used women all through the
[1:05:08] Bible and and and you're and there's no
[1:05:10] there's no lesser amen it's all through
[1:05:14] the Bible amen he knew Peter Peter could
[1:05:17] handle persecution he says and he knows
[1:05:19] your child can handle whatever challenge
[1:05:22] they face in life he created them for it
[1:05:24] don't be scared sced for your children
[1:05:27] but be honored now this is for us
[1:05:29] parents don't be scared for your
[1:05:30] children or your grandchildren whoever
[1:05:32] it might be but be honored that God
[1:05:34] chose you to parent the generation that
[1:05:37] is facing the biggest challenges of our
[1:05:40] lifetime rise to the challenge it says
[1:05:43] raise David's raise Esther's raise
[1:05:46] Ruth's that's that's what we have to do
[1:05:48] as
[1:05:50] parents and we don't do that by telling
[1:05:52] them stay away from the danger ous
[1:05:56] things amen there's there's something
[1:05:58] else there's something else about salt
[1:06:00] that just it's just so beautiful salt
[1:06:02] has and this is you can find this is not
[1:06:04] my words this is right in the message
[1:06:05] salt has no effect unless it comes in
[1:06:08] contact with
[1:06:10] something man says this you have a piece
[1:06:12] of meat here and a barrel of salt here I
[1:06:15] imagine he was doing this and you've got
[1:06:17] to get them together the salt to the
[1:06:20] meat or the meat to the Salt to preserve
[1:06:22] the meat that's the way it is now if you
[1:06:24] don't you don't hear anything else I'm
[1:06:26] going to tell you listen to this
[1:06:27] sentence we've got to get the believer
[1:06:30] with the unbeliever
[1:06:33] yes sometimes that just sometimes I I
[1:06:36] think sometimes we hear no no we just
[1:06:38] need we need do we believe in assembling
[1:06:40] together yes we do but sometimes
[1:06:42] assembling together just becomes an
[1:06:43] assembly correct am we just become
[1:06:46] another assembly we assemble ourselves
[1:06:48] together so that you can regroup so that
[1:06:51] you can re-calibrate so that you can
[1:06:53] heal so that you can come together to go
[1:06:55] out and be salt to the Earth because
[1:06:58] salt in a group salt in in a container
[1:07:01] in a box doesn't do any good to anybody
[1:07:03] as powerful as it is the ability to
[1:07:06] promote life the ability to destroy evil
[1:07:09] does no good as long as it's in the Box
[1:07:11] amen I know this is so simple that you
[1:07:13] brother that's what you're preaching on
[1:07:14] is salt but but yet we have the ability
[1:07:17] to do this and sometimes we go I'm just
[1:07:20] going to I'm just going to be with those
[1:07:21] who think like I do who believe like I
[1:07:23] do well then I'm sorry but but but salt
[1:07:25] isn't doing anybody any good amen the
[1:07:28] salt has to come in contact with that
[1:07:31] thing that needs the salt in order for
[1:07:33] it to change it even has to come in
[1:07:35] contact for you to recognize that what
[1:07:38] God was saying was the truth because you
[1:07:40] can think oh God tells the truth and
[1:07:42] then God says yeah but you're the salt
[1:07:44] of the earth well well I think brother
[1:07:45] Dan's the salt of the earth amen that's
[1:07:48] not what he said he said you were the
[1:07:49] salt of the earth and I think sometimes
[1:07:52] we need to actually see this working in
[1:07:54] our lives we need to go out and actually
[1:07:55] be salt in order for us to go wow God
[1:07:58] know really knows what he's talking
[1:07:59] about yes because we're we're never
[1:08:01] going to say God doesn't know what he's
[1:08:02] talking about and yet do we go and do
[1:08:04] what he
[1:08:05] says there there's a disconnect
[1:08:07] somewhere and why oh I don't have the
[1:08:09] ability you don't need the ability you
[1:08:11] have one thing to do amen you have to
[1:08:14] choose amen that's the only thing I I I
[1:08:17] want to tell you this there's not one
[1:08:18] thing in the Bible that God asks you to
[1:08:21] do or tells you to do or commands you to
[1:08:23] do that he doesn't then come and give
[1:08:25] you the ability to do did you know
[1:08:27] that it's so beautiful the Bible says
[1:08:30] this I wrote down some examples he says
[1:08:33] the Bible says to have faith amen
[1:08:35] hallelujah right we I mean that's like
[1:08:37] the basis of our of our Christianity is
[1:08:39] our faith the Bible says have faith
[1:08:42] faith is the only thing that will please
[1:08:44] God and I don't know maybe it's just me
[1:08:46] but sometimes I find myself Lord I don't
[1:08:48] know if I have faith for this or I'm
[1:08:49] trying to I'm trying to have faith think
[1:08:52] about that statement I'm trying to have
[1:08:54] faith but if we search out the Bible it
[1:08:56] says that he delivered the faith unto
[1:08:59] the Saints that's corre so he tells you
[1:09:01] to have faith and then says oh by the
[1:09:03] way I came and I brought it to you it's
[1:09:05] my faith exact I want you to have my
[1:09:08] faith because my faith in my word
[1:09:10] doesn't fail amen he says the Bible says
[1:09:14] resist the devil and he'll flee from you
[1:09:17] am right anybody ever have any trouble
[1:09:20] resisting the
[1:09:21] devil amen I'll raise my hand amen
[1:09:26] amen the word says that if you have
[1:09:28] problems resisting the devil brother bam
[1:09:30] says then you don't have the resistor
[1:09:32] capital r inside of you
[1:09:35] yet you can go look it
[1:09:38] up he tells you to resist the devil but
[1:09:41] he's the one who comes in and resists
[1:09:43] the devil GL to God it's not my
[1:09:46] ability amen the Bible says to seek Him
[1:09:50] search it out though and he says you
[1:09:52] can't even seek him unless he seeks you
[1:09:54] first amen the Bible says to love oh
[1:09:58] that's a hard
[1:09:59] one it's easy to love those that you
[1:10:02] like it's easy to love those you get
[1:10:04] along with it's easy to love those you
[1:10:06] agree with and the Bible says to love
[1:10:09] even your
[1:10:10] enemy but then the Bible says behold
[1:10:12] what manner of love the father has
[1:10:15] bestowed upon you he tells you you need
[1:10:17] to have love and it says by the way I
[1:10:20] gave you the love that you need to have
[1:10:22] so if you're doing it it's because I'm
[1:10:24] doing it yes the Bible says to confess
[1:10:27] him when the Bible says that if you
[1:10:29] confess him before man he says I'll
[1:10:32] confess you before the father there's
[1:10:35] not one thing that God asks you to do
[1:10:37] that he hasn't already done and is going
[1:10:39] to put in you the ability in fact he's
[1:10:42] already put the ability in you because
[1:10:44] you are not going to be the light of the
[1:10:47] world you are the light of the world and
[1:10:49] what do you have to do you have to
[1:10:51] choose he says we've got to get the UN
[1:10:55] believer and the believer together
[1:10:57] that's right you've got to get them into
[1:10:58] the church into the salty bunch of
[1:11:00] people you know salt makes a thirst
[1:11:02] doesn't it and if you eat salt you get
[1:11:05] thirsty and God wants his church so
[1:11:08] salty till the whole world will thirst
[1:11:10] to be like
[1:11:12] them just think oh if I can only live
[1:11:15] the way that woman
[1:11:19] lives she if she ain't the most sweetest
[1:11:22] peaceful person never out of humor never
[1:11:24] fussy she's always kind trying to do
[1:11:27] something to help somebody else why
[1:11:29] she's a credit to any man's Church yes
[1:11:31] sir that man's used he's he's a neighbor
[1:11:33] he's a gentleman he's just so full of
[1:11:36] the love of God you can see him at all
[1:11:37] hours of the night on his knees
[1:11:39] somewhere praying it's time to check up
[1:11:40] it's time to check up this
[1:11:43] morning he's always ready to do
[1:11:45] something he's always talking about the
[1:11:46] Lord and his Mercy that's the way to
[1:11:49] make the world
[1:11:54] salty you do not
[1:11:57] become you do not have an effect on the
[1:12:00] World by being like the
[1:12:05] world salt has an effect on the World by
[1:12:08] being completely different than what the
[1:12:10] world
[1:12:12] is that's the only way it can have an
[1:12:14] effect you you are influencing the world
[1:12:19] not the other way
[1:12:21] around it it says if you try to be like
[1:12:24] them you lose lose the Savor now you
[1:12:26] know salt never stops Becoming Salt you
[1:12:29] know if you are salt you are salt but I
[1:12:31] love the Scripture it says it starts it
[1:12:33] it's thrown out into the road and it's
[1:12:36] just walked upon what happens is all
[1:12:39] that salt just gets mixed in with dirt
[1:12:41] and you can't tell it
[1:12:42] apart you can't even tell it apart from
[1:12:44] the dirt even though it's set aside if
[1:12:47] we've lost what makes us
[1:12:52] salty if you try to be like the world if
[1:12:54] you try to talk like the world if you
[1:12:55] try to dress like the world if you try
[1:12:57] to think like the world if you try to
[1:12:59] act like the world then your salt has
[1:13:01] become of no effect to the
[1:13:03] world Amen they say well I'm going to go
[1:13:06] and I'm going to I'm gon to I'm going to
[1:13:07] be like them so that I can influence
[1:13:09] them over that's not how salt works I'm
[1:13:12] going to become like meat so I can salt
[1:13:14] the meat right
[1:13:16] no and I know this is just so simple but
[1:13:19] it's but but but I've done this I I've
[1:13:21] I've tried to be a light in to the World
[1:13:24] by taking on
[1:13:29] darkness and and and then then sometimes
[1:13:32] it's worse we try to isolate ourselves
[1:13:34] with other
[1:13:35] salt also no effect to the
[1:13:38] world
[1:13:40] Amen it it's just salt it's just light
[1:13:43] but it it it it it means so much when
[1:13:47] you really look at the ability that you
[1:13:49] have to literally you have the ability
[1:13:52] to promote life the word goes so far as
[1:13:55] say that you have the ability to create
[1:13:58] an atmosphere around you I don't know if
[1:14:00] you've ever done this and and I think I
[1:14:03] more and more I need to be careful about
[1:14:04] how I pray for what for the things I
[1:14:06] pray for I don't know if you've ever
[1:14:08] prayed this way Lord I want you to give
[1:14:10] me uh now you can plug in what you want
[1:14:11] Lord I want you to put me in a workplace
[1:14:14] where there's Christians
[1:14:15] at Lord I want you to put me in a school
[1:14:18] where there's people who believe like me
[1:14:21] Lord I want you to create Lord I want
[1:14:23] you to to just just keep me safe when I
[1:14:25] go to college keep me safe when I go to
[1:14:27] school you know may there not be anybody
[1:14:29] who comes up against me may I not have
[1:14:31] to deal with Spirits that's not that's
[1:14:33] not the right
[1:14:36] prayer you know that sometimes God will
[1:14:38] put you in a place where nothing else
[1:14:41] good is at because you are the light of
[1:14:43] the world amen amen I I think we need to
[1:14:47] be careful Lord uh we need to be careful
[1:14:49] about the way we pray Lord just put me
[1:14:51] in a place where there's no there's no
[1:14:53] unbelief or put me in a place where
[1:14:54] there's other Christians that's good
[1:14:56] it's not wrong to work with other
[1:14:57] Christians but what if God wants you in
[1:14:59] a place where there are no
[1:15:01] Christians because you are the salt of
[1:15:03] that place amen because you are the
[1:15:06] light to that place just a little bit of
[1:15:09] salt can change a
[1:15:12] workplace it can change a college it can
[1:15:15] change a high school it can change a
[1:15:18] church just a little bit of salt that's
[1:15:21] where it it's powerful what it can do
[1:15:23] why because it prevents by its own
[1:15:26] ability evil from growing and it
[1:15:29] promotes The Life of Christ prise the
[1:15:32] lord and it's like well sometimes we
[1:15:33] want to shy away from that I I want to
[1:15:35] challenge you this morning no no no you
[1:15:37] need to look pray to God lord where do
[1:15:39] you want me to be salty at I saw last
[1:15:43] night on the middle of on a street
[1:15:44] corner people wanting to be salty that's
[1:15:47] what I saw in a worship service and
[1:15:49] guess what happened people who were
[1:15:51] thirsty started to
[1:15:53] come they might even know I I imagine
[1:15:56] those those the Mormon Brothers didn't
[1:15:58] even know why they were drawn but you
[1:15:59] know what it
[1:16:00] is I don't know why but I'm
[1:16:03] thirsty I didn't think I was thirsty but
[1:16:06] all of a sudden I'm
[1:16:08] thirsty I'm going to stay well that's a
[1:16:10] good I'll just stay maybe just maybe
[1:16:11] just a minute
[1:16:13] longer and maybe just a minute longer
[1:16:15] and maybe just a minute longer is it
[1:16:18] because is it because we did anything oh
[1:16:20] sure there was singing there was music
[1:16:22] but it's because God
[1:16:25] he came down in an atmosphere that was
[1:16:27] made for him and God works the ability
[1:16:31] of us not us H uh the scripture says may
[1:16:35] they when they look at
[1:16:37] you may they see your good
[1:16:41] works and glorify the father I love that
[1:16:44] scripture because if the scripture had
[1:16:46] said if they see your good works and
[1:16:48] glorify you there's something wrong but
[1:16:52] imagine when the world can see your good
[1:16:54] work
[1:16:55] and the first and only thing they think
[1:16:57] of is wow there is a God not oh man this
[1:17:00] is a great sister this is a great
[1:17:02] brother oh I just really like them but
[1:17:04] no when they see your life they know
[1:17:07] there's a God praise the Lord and I'm
[1:17:09] telling you that's what it's like to be
[1:17:10] the salt of the
[1:17:12] earth I I I need to move forward if
[1:17:15] we're okay here
[1:17:17] fine what are the characteristics of
[1:17:19] somebody who is salty and it's right in
[1:17:21] the same exact sermon he's preaching he
[1:17:23] says if you want to know if you want to
[1:17:25] know what it's like to be the salt of
[1:17:26] the earth you want to be the light of
[1:17:28] the world we think I don't know what you
[1:17:30] think but sometimes I think okay I need
[1:17:31] to be I need to be strong in the Lord I
[1:17:34] need to be I need to be a a minister I
[1:17:37] need to be an evangelist or I need to be
[1:17:40] just uh I need to be uh so zealous for
[1:17:42] the Lord I need to be have this this
[1:17:44] Mighty faith I'm just telling you what I
[1:17:46] think I don't know if you think this way
[1:17:49] I I just need to have this this powerful
[1:17:51] Faith that's never defeated I need to uh
[1:17:54] all all of a I need to do this I need to
[1:17:56] do this I need to do this and he says
[1:17:58] let me tell you what the characteristics
[1:18:00] of somebody is salty it's right in the
[1:18:01] in the Beatitudes it says uh it's poor
[1:18:03] in
[1:18:05] spirit well I can say Amen to that
[1:18:07] one poor in
[1:18:10] spirit those who
[1:18:12] mourn you know what that means well well
[1:18:14] everybody Mourns brother no it means
[1:18:16] those who are grieved when they do
[1:18:19] something against
[1:18:21] God does that mean
[1:18:24] I'm I'm telling you the way that I think
[1:18:26] sometimes is well you would never do
[1:18:27] something to upset God right and then
[1:18:30] right out of the bat I fail well I guess
[1:18:32] I'm not the salt of the earth because I
[1:18:33] I said this I did this I know he's not
[1:18:36] pleased I must not be the salt but yet
[1:18:38] he says no no when you're grieved that
[1:18:40] you do
[1:18:41] that it's actually a good
[1:18:44] characteristic it's not the
[1:18:45] characteristic that you don't oppose the
[1:18:47] lord it's that you are grieved when you
[1:18:49] do
[1:18:50] am cuz many times our thoughts our
[1:18:54] actions
[1:18:55] not even intentional are opposed to the
[1:18:57] Lord sometimes I pray for things and
[1:18:59] it's the exact opposite of what I should
[1:19:01] be praying for and I had a good
[1:19:02] motivation to do it and yet when he
[1:19:04] comes if you will listen and take the
[1:19:07] correction that is a characteristic that
[1:19:10] I'm sorry it's not a characteristic that
[1:19:12] you could have naturally it is a
[1:19:13] god-given
[1:19:16] characteristic
[1:19:20] gentle
[1:19:23] merciful Peacemaker
[1:19:26] well I started to read these and I
[1:19:28] thought do I have these characteristics
[1:19:31] I I have to say I fall I'll fall
[1:19:35] short pure in
[1:19:37] heart and
[1:19:40] persecuted that's the characteristics of
[1:19:42] somebody who's
[1:19:43] salty and I don't It's just sometimes
[1:19:46] it's the opposite of what we think
[1:19:48] sometimes we think it's this powerful
[1:19:51] powerful Christian and to God this is
[1:19:54] powerful
[1:19:55] yes it is yes it is to God this is
[1:19:58] powerful being gentle being merciful you
[1:20:01] say no no you need to be able to preach
[1:20:03] and you need to be able to speak
[1:20:04] eloquently to God this is powerful and
[1:20:08] to God this is something that any
[1:20:10] brother any sister any young person can
[1:20:12] have in their life and I want to tell
[1:20:14] you something you already have it in
[1:20:16] your life correct amen otherwise the
[1:20:19] Bible would say become the salt of the
[1:20:23] earth amen but it doesn't say
[1:20:27] that and I just want to move forward it
[1:20:29] says
[1:20:32] um how did Stephen do it talking about
[1:20:35] Steph in the Bible brother manam says
[1:20:36] this and let your let your light so
[1:20:39] shine before men he never we're talking
[1:20:41] about Steven now the first martyr he
[1:20:43] never performed any Miracles although he
[1:20:46] know that Christ was a miracle performer
[1:20:49] correct amen kind sounds like sounds
[1:20:51] like me a little bit I don't know about
[1:20:53] you sounds like me a little bit
[1:20:55] he knowed all these powers and things
[1:20:57] but what did he do he just presented his
[1:21:00] life in such a way that they saw it was
[1:21:04] the power of Christ not the power of
[1:21:07] Step not the power of the church that
[1:21:09] Steven belonged to the power of Christ
[1:21:12] and I want to tell you this this is for
[1:21:14] everybody but this for the young people
[1:21:16] because I know what goes through your
[1:21:17] mind I know what goes through your mind
[1:21:20] you start to self-examine what you do
[1:21:22] you start to self-examine how you are
[1:21:25] and immediately you disqualify yourself
[1:21:27] from being salt right he says you may
[1:21:30] never see a vision okay but you may
[1:21:34] never put your hands on a sick person
[1:21:37] and feel the charge of almighty God make
[1:21:40] a skeleton of a man turn back to life
[1:21:42] again you may never do that you may
[1:21:44] never see him standing Yonder in three
[1:21:46] and four
[1:21:47] rainbows now listen that sounds Grand
[1:21:50] you may never see his
[1:21:52] image how about this you may never hear
[1:21:56] his
[1:21:59] voice I'm telling you there shouldn't be
[1:22:01] one person now that's
[1:22:02] disqualified you may never hear his
[1:22:05] voice but you can still be a signboard
[1:22:09] that will reflect Christ yes amen amen
[1:22:13] by a life that's been so pure and
[1:22:16] unadulterated from the world not
[1:22:19] cluttered up with dirty things around
[1:22:20] your life but a pure thing
[1:22:25] think about those words a pure
[1:22:30] thing that'll cause the Hungry Heart to
[1:22:32] hunger and thirst to be like you you are
[1:22:36] the salt of the earth and if the salt
[1:22:38] has lost its Savor wherewith shall it be
[1:22:40] salted that's right let your light so
[1:22:43] shine before men that they may see your
[1:22:45] good works see what you do and glorify
[1:22:49] the father that's in heaven signboards
[1:22:52] reflecting
[1:22:54] yes he says you are the light of the
[1:22:56] world I had this written down but for
[1:22:58] time I don't know if I want to go into
[1:22:59] the there's there's just real quickly I
[1:23:02] think sometimes we think of light in in
[1:23:04] different ways but the but the word
[1:23:06] talks about three different lights talks
[1:23:08] about the sunlight now we have a great
[1:23:10] example this
[1:23:11] weekend man when that sun is shining
[1:23:14] it's hot it's warm we feel we feel the
[1:23:18] sun race it gives life to things it
[1:23:20] causes it causes nature to renew it
[1:23:23] causes plants to renew but as soon as
[1:23:26] the clouds come over that Sun's gone
[1:23:30] that light's there but it can't be seen
[1:23:31] I think sometimes our light to the world
[1:23:33] is exactly the same way I think
[1:23:36] sometimes our light to the world is just
[1:23:37] like sunlight when it's good brother
[1:23:39] Daniel it's good it's good but then
[1:23:42] Storms
[1:23:43] Come and and I felt so good a week ago
[1:23:46] or I felt so good a month ago maybe a
[1:23:48] month from now you'll feel good about
[1:23:50] the song service you had last night but
[1:23:52] a month from now will you feel the same
[1:23:53] way Lord Lord I felt so good when we
[1:23:55] were doing that worship or I felt so
[1:23:57] good in that service what happened a
[1:23:58] storm cloud came over because that was
[1:24:01] that was a light that wasn't sustainable
[1:24:03] although good and it has its place the
[1:24:06] sunlight is not what we're trying to
[1:24:08] be we shine forth like Christians we
[1:24:11] look like Christians we read our Bible
[1:24:12] and pray and then sometimes one thing
[1:24:14] happens and that's all out out the
[1:24:16] window let a little let a little
[1:24:18] sickness come let a little heartache
[1:24:20] come let a little crisis come and all of
[1:24:23] a sudden we forget to be light to the
[1:24:26] world and the and the world no longer
[1:24:28] sees a Christian they just see a
[1:24:30] person and he talks about he talks about
[1:24:33] another light he talks about the light
[1:24:35] inside the inner Court he says that's
[1:24:37] when you're in the outer court and
[1:24:38] you're walking around in in in the
[1:24:40] sunlight he says but you enter into the
[1:24:42] inner court and now you have the seven
[1:24:43] candlesticks that are lit he says and
[1:24:45] those seven candlesticks are lit by Theo
[1:24:47] that the oil is the holy spirit he says
[1:24:50] that's that's not a light that being
[1:24:51] covered up by clouds he says that's
[1:24:53] that's a whole Holy Light that's when
[1:24:56] you've had an experience with God that's
[1:24:57] when you could say Lord I I know that
[1:24:59] you're real I know it's not just a flash
[1:25:02] of light outside I know it's just not a
[1:25:03] sunlight Lord I've had an experience
[1:25:06] maybe I'm not where I should be but Lord
[1:25:08] I know you're real lord I trust I
[1:25:10] believe that you're in my heart but I
[1:25:11] don't know that you're in my heart
[1:25:13] because he says sometimes those candles
[1:25:15] although they're great he goes sometimes
[1:25:17] they get a little bit smoked up amen
[1:25:20] sometimes he the candle goes out and you
[1:25:22] have to relight the candle
[1:25:25] amen he says but there's another room Oh
[1:25:29] Glory Hallelujah there's another room
[1:25:32] Beyond the Veil amen he says that light
[1:25:36] when you enter into that light amen it
[1:25:39] can never go
[1:25:41] out he says it's not and I I I had this
[1:25:44] in a quote I I'll have to find it for
[1:25:46] you if you want but he says it's not
[1:25:48] even this bright light he says it's just
[1:25:49] a a dim constant light always Shining
[1:25:54] and he says when you enter into that
[1:25:56] you're actually hidden inside that light
[1:26:00] am and he says he references the
[1:26:03] scripture when you enter into my
[1:26:07] rest because I'm telling you there's
[1:26:09] nothing that is more stressful than
[1:26:12] trying to be the salt of the earth when
[1:26:14] you're trying to do
[1:26:15] it there is nothing more stressful than
[1:26:18] trying to be the light of the world when
[1:26:20] you're trying to be the light of the
[1:26:21] world I I I'll tell you right now there
[1:26:23] is no rest in that amen it's constant
[1:26:27] stress constant worrying constant
[1:26:30] worrying about what you look like your
[1:26:31] image but when you're hid in
[1:26:33] Christ you don't have to worry about
[1:26:35] those things let let clouds
[1:26:39] come that doesn't affect the light
[1:26:41] that's in you let sickness come let
[1:26:43] death come I I I just love the word
[1:26:45] because he says well brother Brandon we
[1:26:47] uh I had a family member that got sick
[1:26:49] and they died he says praise the Lord
[1:26:52] anyhow I lost all my money I lost my
[1:26:55] finances my house he goes well just
[1:26:57] praise the Lord
[1:26:58] anyways there's there's a light that
[1:27:00] cannot be affected by what happens to
[1:27:03] you only you can have an effect on the
[1:27:05] world not the other way
[1:27:07] around there's sometimes that there's a
[1:27:10] our hunger our joy and our worship
[1:27:12] sometimes gets covered up by clouds and
[1:27:14] crisis and we start to think Lord am I
[1:27:16] even one of yours am I even a child of
[1:27:19] God do I even have the light and I'm
[1:27:21] telling you we're trying to we're trying
[1:27:23] to rely on our ability amen we're
[1:27:28] trying we're trying to be the light of
[1:27:30] the world we're trying to be salt but
[1:27:32] that's not how light works and that's
[1:27:34] not how salt works and maybe you'll even
[1:27:36] start to question whether you're really
[1:27:38] a Christian maybe you'll start to ask is
[1:27:41] it really worth struggling and fighting
[1:27:43] when it's just easier to give up right
[1:27:45] amen I know how it is to be young person
[1:27:48] and I think there's even I don't even
[1:27:49] say just young people there's us adults
[1:27:51] that feel that way am
[1:27:55] amen how can I be the light of the world
[1:27:57] when I can't even be a light for
[1:28:02] myself Jesus said in John he says are
[1:28:04] there not 12 hours in the day if any man
[1:28:07] walk in the day he stumbleth not it's
[1:28:09] good when we're walking in the day
[1:28:10] brother Kurt oh man when it's sunlight
[1:28:12] oh it's good to be a Christian when it
[1:28:14] feels good when everybody agrees when
[1:28:16] there's amens he says but if a man walk
[1:28:19] in the night he stumbleth because
[1:28:21] there's no light in
[1:28:23] him what happens when it's night what
[1:28:25] happens when the light goes out what
[1:28:27] happens when the clouds
[1:28:31] come when he says that you're the light
[1:28:33] of the world that holiest of holies is
[1:28:35] what he's talking
[1:28:39] about evil thoughts will come to afflict
[1:28:42] you but they don't have an
[1:28:46] anchor habits try to get back into your
[1:28:48] life they have no foothold over you why
[1:28:52] because you're hidden from them
[1:28:55] and it's such a paradox he says that
[1:28:57] there you'll be like a city on a hill
[1:29:01] whose light cannot be hidden and here's
[1:29:03] the Paradox of it is not your light
[1:29:06] you're hidden inside of that light think
[1:29:08] about that when you think about for that
[1:29:10] for a minute you think about Peter
[1:29:13] walking by the Gates of Jerusalem and he
[1:29:16] walks by I believe it was Peter I fact
[1:29:20] check myself on that one and just the
[1:29:23] shadow of him
[1:29:24] passing over somebody and that man is
[1:29:27] healed was it Peter's
[1:29:29] Shadow and how is a shadow cast when a
[1:29:33] light hits an object I I I could just
[1:29:36] picture it now if maybe if I were
[1:29:38] sitting there and I look up you just see
[1:29:41] light you don't see Peter you just see
[1:29:44] light because he was hidden in the one
[1:29:48] who has the ability to raise a man from
[1:29:51] his from from his feet from his crippled
[1:29:54] State it's not Peter amen but at that
[1:29:57] moment Peter was a light to the world
[1:29:59] Why by being hidden in the light it it's
[1:30:02] so simple and yet if Peter would have
[1:30:05] tried to be the light to somebody that's
[1:30:07] not how it works if Peter would have
[1:30:09] tried to be the salt of the earth it
[1:30:11] wouldn't have worked that way Jes you've
[1:30:14] entered into his rest he
[1:30:16] said and I I I just want to close I know
[1:30:19] this is maybe simple and it's maybe
[1:30:22] short I don't know how you feel about
[1:30:23] the short part
[1:30:25] button he says notice let us remember he
[1:30:28] also created our bodies and won't our
[1:30:31] bodies have to obey
[1:30:34] him that's that goes back to does God
[1:30:37] lie no does he know what he's
[1:30:40] doing okay then what's the problem and I
[1:30:43] think sometimes the problem is and I'm
[1:30:45] just I just want to be honest with you I
[1:30:47] think sometimes the problem that keeps
[1:30:49] us from being light and being salt is
[1:30:52] that we're ashamed of things that we've
[1:30:53] done
[1:30:57] and every time we try to be salt and say
[1:31:00] Lord I'm I I want you to be the salt I
[1:31:03] want to give myself away shame of things
[1:31:05] that we've done comes right up before
[1:31:07] our face and we turn around we walk away
[1:31:10] from the
[1:31:12] opportunity and and and that's the
[1:31:14] beautiful part about the Lord is that he
[1:31:16] creates I I think he creates the whole
[1:31:19] situation so that the thing you're
[1:31:21] ashamed of comes up before your eyes and
[1:31:24] he's right there and he says okay now I
[1:31:26] can't take it from you you have to give
[1:31:29] it Oh
[1:31:31] Glory and I created this whole situation
[1:31:34] I preached a whole sermon on a mountain
[1:31:36] about you being salt about you being
[1:31:38] light so that the thing that kept you
[1:31:41] from being it comes up before your face
[1:31:44] so I can take it away from you praise
[1:31:45] the
[1:31:46] Lord and and you maybe that's too
[1:31:49] simplistic but I think that's how the
[1:31:50] Lord works because I'm telling you when
[1:31:52] I picture myself Lord I I want to be the
[1:31:55] salt of the earth I want to be the light
[1:31:57] of the world the things that I think
[1:31:59] prevent me from being that come right up
[1:32:01] before my
[1:32:02] face and it's I'm telling you in those
[1:32:05] moments it's never what somebody else
[1:32:08] did it's always what I did and that's
[1:32:11] when you know it's true yes when you
[1:32:13] know it's the Lord showing you because
[1:32:15] we could sit here and think oh I got
[1:32:17] problems and it's you don't know it's
[1:32:19] because of so and so and it's because of
[1:32:21] my family and it's because of this my
[1:32:23] past it's because of all these things we
[1:32:25] have legitimate traumas we have things
[1:32:27] that have happened to us but if the
[1:32:28] thing that comes before your face I
[1:32:31] guarantee you will be the thing that you
[1:32:32] do the thing that you think the thing
[1:32:35] that you say and and and and it's the
[1:32:39] Lord creating a whole sermon a whole
[1:32:41] situation just to reveal to you the
[1:32:44] thing you need to give him Hallelujah
[1:32:46] isn't that powerful he's he's just so
[1:32:49] gentle about it though he doesn't come
[1:32:51] and say oh I don't know look at you
[1:32:53] you're just so you're you're so bad and
[1:32:55] if you give me this thing I'll make you
[1:32:56] good no he tells you you're already good
[1:32:59] amen you're already good it says salt is
[1:33:01] good that scripture yours the salt of
[1:33:03] the earth you're the light of the world
[1:33:04] and then when your own unction which is
[1:33:08] the holy spirit in you creating that
[1:33:10] that unction that says I don't know if I
[1:33:12] can be that because of this he goes ah
[1:33:14] there it
[1:33:15] is there is the thing that was keeping
[1:33:18] you from being the light of the world
[1:33:20] let me just take that from you but guess
[1:33:23] what you have to give it to him yes amen
[1:33:25] he say I don't know if I can give it to
[1:33:27] him I'm telling you this is the moment
[1:33:30] for you to give it to him yes now you
[1:33:32] could wait for some
[1:33:34] meetings you could wait for a prayer
[1:33:36] line you could wait for an altar call or
[1:33:38] you can just do the one thing oh Glory
[1:33:42] that is yours to do Hallelujah and
[1:33:44] that's make a decision Hallelujah and
[1:33:48] you say well that sounds like good good
[1:33:49] Baptist Doctrine yeah but there's truth
[1:33:51] in that there's truth in making a
[1:33:54] decision amen there's truth in saying
[1:33:57] Lord I don't deserve you I don't deserve
[1:34:01] to have this thing that I do taken away
[1:34:03] from you but Lord I need it
[1:34:06] gone and you can't do that until you
[1:34:09] really just face what you struggle with
[1:34:11] and say Lord I do this because I like to
[1:34:14] do
[1:34:16] it Lord I I like to do
[1:34:19] it be honest with
[1:34:22] them otherwise it's just hiding it from
[1:34:24] him it's saying well Lord I'll give you
[1:34:25] this little piece but I'll keep this
[1:34:27] other piece back here and then we expect
[1:34:30] to be the salt of the earth sometimes it
[1:34:31] doesn't it doesn't
[1:34:34] work and he cares so much and he wants
[1:34:38] to take your burden more than you want
[1:34:40] to give it to him yes amen that he'll
[1:34:43] create a whole situation that is
[1:34:46] thousands of years long for you to come
[1:34:49] into a situation
[1:34:50] where your own shame the things you do
[1:34:53] are right before your
[1:34:55] face so that he can gently remove them
[1:34:58] from you yes he does very good he says
[1:35:03] you surrender your thoughts to him
[1:35:04] Surrender Your Life to him Surrender
[1:35:07] Your Faith to him correct and watch that
[1:35:11] body obey what he
[1:35:15] says if that doesn't happen then he's
[1:35:17] not
[1:35:18] God and I believe he's God if that
[1:35:22] doesn't happen then he's liar and I
[1:35:24] don't believe he's a
[1:35:26] liar if you're a drunkard and you can't
[1:35:28] quit surrender that life to him and
[1:35:33] watch you'll drink no more if you're a
[1:35:36] habitual smoker and tried to get up give
[1:35:38] it up and can't do it Just Surrender
[1:35:40] that to him and watch what happens I'm
[1:35:42] not going to add to the word here but
[1:35:44] let's just make it for 2024 if you can't
[1:35:46] control
[1:35:48] this give it to
[1:35:50] him or is it better for you to walk
[1:35:53] around
[1:35:55] saying oh I'll defeat
[1:35:57] this I'll overcome this but if we read
[1:36:00] the Bible and you search it out you
[1:36:02] can't overcome unless you have the
[1:36:03] Overcomer
[1:36:05] inside and and I'm so and you know what
[1:36:07] I I'm I'm so tired of the devil telling
[1:36:10] telling people especially our young
[1:36:12] people you know what you need to get
[1:36:13] clean enough to get the Holy
[1:36:16] Ghost amen I believe in sanctification I
[1:36:19] believe in justification but there is
[1:36:21] nothing that cleans you out like the
[1:36:24] Holy Spirit now I want to ask you a
[1:36:26] question if you can live a life good
[1:36:28] enough to be worthy of the Holy Spirit
[1:36:31] then why do you need the Holy
[1:36:33] Spirit that's the question if you can
[1:36:36] live a life worthy of it then why do you
[1:36:38] need
[1:36:39] it Lord I want to be clean let me get
[1:36:41] cleaned up so you can come inside and
[1:36:43] God's saying let me come inside so you
[1:36:45] can be
[1:36:46] clean Hallelujah Lord let me let me be
[1:36:50] the salt of the
[1:36:51] earth let me be the salt of the earth so
[1:36:54] you can be a sweet Savor and he's saying
[1:36:56] let me in so you can be the salt of the
[1:36:59] earth Lord let me let me get cleaned up
[1:37:01] let me get good enough for you to come
[1:37:03] in and how are we going to do and I know
[1:37:06] maybe we don't think that or say that
[1:37:07] but we act that way sometimes we act
[1:37:10] that way sometimes oh Lord I I when I
[1:37:13] really really feel good enough I'll go
[1:37:16] up and I'll get prayer how about right
[1:37:18] where you're sitting right now you can
[1:37:20] make a decision and say Lord I'm no good
[1:37:23] but I believe your word and I believe
[1:37:25] you're not a
[1:37:26] liar and Lord if you say that I'm the
[1:37:29] light of the world Amen I don't see it
[1:37:32] I'll just be honest with you Lord I
[1:37:33] don't see it but you got to make it
[1:37:35] happen you want me to be the salty of
[1:37:37] the earth I'll go and I'll be willing to
[1:37:39] go where you send me but Lord you better
[1:37:41] make me salty cuz my salt it doesn't do
[1:37:44] a single bit of good for anybody my
[1:37:46] light oh it'll fade it'll fade I'll go
[1:37:49] out and I'll be a witness in my light as
[1:37:51] soon as a storm comes
[1:37:53] that person will stop seeing a
[1:37:55] Christian but but if I'm hid in Christ
[1:37:58] he says if you make that body come back
[1:38:01] in subjection to the word how are you
[1:38:03] going to make it subjection to the word
[1:38:05] if you're not in the word
[1:38:07] amen how do you even know what to make
[1:38:09] it subjection to get into the word oh we
[1:38:12] got preachers that's I'm sorry but
[1:38:14] that's not
[1:38:15] enough the preacher not enough it's not
[1:38:18] enough to come here on a Wednesday and
[1:38:20] on a Sunday and that's how you get your
[1:38:22] food amen right amen get into the word
[1:38:25] I'm preaching to me I should just sit
[1:38:27] right down there with you and say
[1:38:31] it that's the truth but you've got to
[1:38:33] surrender to him you've got to believe
[1:38:34] him he made our bodies they obey his
[1:38:37] will do you believe that he asks if
[1:38:40] you're a Christian you'll have
[1:38:44] to he said you say oh he makes our
[1:38:47] bodies obey oh I I don't I believe we
[1:38:49] have jurisdiction over them you know
[1:38:52] what that is I believe that I have the
[1:38:54] willpower I believe that I have the
[1:38:56] faith I believe that I have what it
[1:38:58] takes to overcome he says you're not
[1:39:00] fully surrendered
[1:39:02] yet you might have given part of
[1:39:04] yourself away but you haven't given
[1:39:05] yourself
[1:39:06] away for you are not your own you are
[1:39:09] dead amen amen dead and hidden in Christ
[1:39:15] and I'm so grateful that I don't have to
[1:39:17] rely on my
[1:39:20] ability to be the light I I I've never
[1:39:22] been more grateful than today that I
[1:39:24] don't have to rely on this person's
[1:39:27] ability which is none to be salty
[1:39:33] amen you yourself are dead and your life
[1:39:35] is hidden God through Christ and sealed
[1:39:38] by the Holy Ghost how are you going to
[1:39:40] get away from
[1:39:42] that I think we need a Revival he says
[1:39:44] our lives are dead we are dead your own
[1:39:47] thoughts are dead he says you think pure
[1:39:51] thoughts and I know I I know the first
[1:39:54] thing that comes up well brother I I
[1:39:57] might have a thought that's not pure
[1:40:00] it's got to go to
[1:40:02] die we're not exempt from having
[1:40:04] thoughts attack us but
[1:40:07] salt it it in inhibits the growth of
[1:40:11] that
[1:40:12] evil you might be attacked all day long
[1:40:15] but salt does not allow it to grow sure
[1:40:18] there's sure there's evil sure there's
[1:40:20] bad thoughts sure there's filth but salt
[1:40:22] doesn't allow that to grow you'll come
[1:40:24] in contact sure you'll come in
[1:40:26] contact but you have a power an
[1:40:29] overcoming power in you and your life is
[1:40:32] hid in God through Christ and sealed by
[1:40:35] the Holy
[1:40:36] Spirit until the next Revival no he says
[1:40:39] until the day of your
[1:40:40] Redemption and we know we've passed from
[1:40:42] death into life I I had other I'm just
[1:40:45] going to leave it there if you just I I
[1:40:47] just want to ask you I I'm
[1:40:51] I'm never never been one that had the
[1:40:55] ability
[1:40:56] to to inspire people for an alter call
[1:40:59] for for any of that but I could ask you
[1:41:02] a simple
[1:41:04] question you have one thing to do and
[1:41:07] that's make a decision now you said
[1:41:09] maybe you say I made that decision years
[1:41:11] ago you have one
[1:41:14] today you have another decision today
[1:41:16] he's a new God today he's a new God
[1:41:19] today am amen you say I decided I
[1:41:22] decided years ago I decided a month ago
[1:41:24] I decided a year ago but what about
[1:41:26] today and I maybe if we just close our
[1:41:30] eyes because you know I I don't know
[1:41:32] sometimes we get a little bit ashamed to
[1:41:36] even raise our
[1:41:38] hand maybe ashamed of what somebody
[1:41:40] would think about us maybe somebody
[1:41:41] would say well what do you have in your
[1:41:43] life I won't even I won't even have my
[1:41:45] eyes open but if there's somebody who
[1:41:47] would just raise a hand you say it's
[1:41:49] just a it's just an act it could mean
[1:41:52] the difference between life and death
[1:41:54] amen because at the bottom of that hand
[1:41:57] is a heart yes amen and and and I'm
[1:42:01] telling you that you are not going to
[1:42:02] become the salt of the earth you are the
[1:42:05] salt of the
[1:42:06] earth but if you have something that is
[1:42:09] in the way if the Lord's put it before
[1:42:11] your face and he's done that no man can
[1:42:14] do that no preacher can do that only God
[1:42:16] can bring up what you know is in your
[1:42:19] heart and put it right before you and I
[1:42:21] want to ask you would you give it to him
[1:42:22] this morning
[1:42:25] and I promise you that your body your
[1:42:27] mind your spirit will come into
[1:42:30] obedience to him if you just surrender
[1:42:34] everything to him it's such a simple
[1:42:37] request it's a simple
[1:42:38] message and yet sometimes I think we
[1:42:41] miss just a little bit of a surrender
[1:42:44] and maybe we surrendered but we built up
[1:42:47] our ability we built up our faith we
[1:42:49] built up our way of doing things and the
[1:42:51] Lord says no but today I want want to
[1:42:53] work through
[1:42:54] [Music]
[1:42:56] you and with nobody nobody looking
[1:42:58] around would you just if you feel that
[1:43:00] way if you believe that if you're
[1:43:02] sincere in your heart and I think he
[1:43:04] knows your heart would you just raise
[1:43:05] your hand to
[1:43:07] [Music]
[1:43:08] him and God you only are Lord looking at
[1:43:11] these hands and you're looking at a
[1:43:12] heart behind those
[1:43:14] hands and Lord you're looking at Lord a
[1:43:18] desire for somebody to be your
[1:43:21] light Lord for somebody to be salt like
[1:43:24] you are salty Lord and Lord I I I just I
[1:43:28] pray Lord that it's not just an
[1:43:30] emotional workup Lord Lord we could we
[1:43:33] could have an emotion and we can leave
[1:43:34] Lord and be gone a day later Lord but
[1:43:37] that real genuine change comes into the
[1:43:40] life of a person behind a
[1:43:43] hand Lord if they know you Lord would
[1:43:46] they just be able to raise their hand
[1:43:47] say Lord I know you but I want to know
[1:43:49] more of you Lord I've lived in your
[1:43:52] light but Lord I want to enter in and be
[1:43:54] hidden in that life forever Lord Lord
[1:43:57] maybe I've basked in your sunlight Lord
[1:43:59] in your candl light Lord but I want your
[1:44:01] Holy Spirit Lord Lord I want to be so
[1:44:04] filled with it so filled with it Lord
[1:44:08] that when someone sees me Lord when you
[1:44:10] walk into a workplace when you walk into
[1:44:12] a school room or you walk into a
[1:44:14] business Lord there's your people are
[1:44:16] drawn to these lives father and Lord we
[1:44:19] cannot do that of oursel Father Lord
[1:44:23] takes you doing that and in a simple
[1:44:25] prayer Lord just a simple request it it
[1:44:28] it's not a motion lord it's not a
[1:44:30] working up of the people Lord It's a
[1:44:32] simple belief Lord only believe in you
[1:44:34] and I believe that there's hands raised
[1:44:37] and I believe there's Hearts behind
[1:44:38] those hands
[1:44:41] Lord and Lord we have no ability to do
[1:44:43] this except you give it to us
[1:44:47] Lord and I trust you'll do that work
[1:44:50] father Lord would you just
[1:44:55] Lord speak to the heart if there's a
[1:44:57] hand raised Lord would you just speak to
[1:44:59] their heart Lord you can do it like no

[1:49:54] change Jesus Christ himself he said in
[1:49:58] the evening time that there would be
[1:50:02] light I want to be that light that he
[1:50:05] talked
[1:50:06] about the
[1:50:08] Apostle our brother mentioned
[1:50:11] Stephen Stephen was that
[1:50:15] light and he made an
[1:50:18] influence on people he lit up the world
[1:50:21] and there was a sinner young man there
[1:50:25] that hated Christianity he hated this
[1:50:28] religion and Stephen was that light and
[1:50:31] he spread his light before and this
[1:50:34] young man saw what he
[1:50:37] did and that young
[1:50:40] man took what stepen sacrificed and that
[1:50:45] young man in the The Sinner that he was
[1:50:49] that young man changed the world his
[1:50:50] name was Saul of Tarsus
[1:50:54] and God used the
[1:50:57] testimony of stepen because he was the
[1:51:02] salt of the
[1:51:03] earth he was the light of the
[1:51:06] world let's all

[1:51:47] earth let me ask you and I want to
[1:51:51] witness before Jesus Christ Christ
