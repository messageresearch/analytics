[30:26] [Music]
[30:28] my heart the first verse was a tiny
[30:34] simple stable all batter
[30:41] [Music]
[30:42] hardly the place for a king to be born
[30:48] he didn't choose someplace special to
[30:53] reveal his majesty
[30:56] so I know if I'll give him control he'll
[31:01] be born in me
[31:05] you know
[31:08] before in the manger of my heart let it
[31:16] live in me let it start
[31:21] I live inside this house of play and

[31:33] in the manger
[31:35] [Music]
[31:37] my
[31:41] well outwardly and nothing not much to
[31:48] behold hardly the place for his word to
[31:55] unfold but if I'll just heal this vessel
[32:01] and let him have his way from glory on
[32:07] to glory
[32:09] he'll change me day by day
[32:12] even though
[32:16] would be born in the manger of my heart
[32:22] let it
[32:25] let it start
[32:29] live inside this house they hold it
[32:35] every day that you were before in the
[32:42] manger
[32:46] [Music]
[32:49] and pleasing let me be pleasing to you
[32:59] at everything I do
[33:04] [Applause]
[33:05] be pleased
[33:08] easy prey but everything
[33:19] I presume be pleasing unto you that your
[33:31] prayer easy
[33:35] [Music]
[33:38] let me be pleasing to you and everything
[33:47] I do be pleasing hey
[34:01] and everything I pursued be pleasing
[34:12] unto you and how do we please it by
[34:18] faith you know without faith it's
[34:20] impossible to please God so brother
[34:22] Aaron comes to take the pair across
[34:24] let's sing reach out and touch the Lord
[34:25] we touch him by faith reach out and
[34:31] touch the Lord as he passes by you'll
[34:40] find he's not too busy
[34:49] here's passing - oh you're
[34:56] -
[34:59] reach out and touch the low
[35:04] [Music]
[35:07] one more time I'll reach out and touch
[35:13] them
[35:15] ah
[35:15] [Music]
[35:17] [Applause]
[35:19] [Music]
[35:20] boy you're fine he's not too busy
[35:25] [Music]
[35:36] every to reach out and touch you know in
[35:53] the prayer lines there were those that
[35:56] would come up to be prayed for and and
[35:59] they're coming up believing and asking
[36:02] God to meet with him whatever that need
[36:04] was and then there were those sitting in
[36:06] the audience who were just asking God it
[36:09] caught it right in the middle of brother
[36:11] Brandon was stopping he would turn in he
[36:12] would say now you over there God will
[36:15] meet you if you just opened your heart
[36:17] to say Lord I need you and you know I
[36:20] was listening to pour some a message for
[36:24] service and brother Branham says you
[36:26] asked that mountain to be moved and it
[36:29] will be moved but he said also check
[36:31] your motive why do you want it to be
[36:33] moved and sometimes we you know a Lord I
[36:36] want you to do this and this so I can
[36:37] continue doing what I'm what I want to
[36:39] do the band says check your motive so
[36:42] just right now as we read these quiz
[36:45] look at yourself and said Lord is there
[36:46] something that maybe I've been doing
[36:48] wrong catch my attention on it and let's
[36:50] let's make it right and let God move we
[36:52] we have a couple of requests here the
[36:56] sister Joyce Duggal will be having
[36:58] surgery on Tuesday but they had Duggal
[37:00] had mentioned it to me that they had
[37:03] started us operation on her and they're
[37:05] going to finish it now so let's remember
[37:08] her and then sister Sarah Cotner she had
[37:12] had a surgery recently and was taken to
[37:16] the urgent care with a fever of a
[37:18] hundred and one so just remembering her
[37:21] and prayer and then
[37:22] sister Holly she was here with us this
[37:25] morning and she had asked prayer
[37:27] concerning one of the co-workers in the
[37:29] hospital that she works up down in the
[37:32] Green Valley area that had been taken
[37:34] home sick and they did find her with the
[37:37] cove at 19 so again God watches over his
[37:41] children so if you'll stand with me and
[37:44] and you've looked at your heart you said
[37:47] Lord if there's anything that's wrong I
[37:49] just want to say I'm sorry I want to I
[37:50] want to get that clean and then nothing
[37:52] can hinder the prayer and and God can
[37:55] move so let's just believe that whatever
[37:57] that need is just say Lord I believe and
[38:00] help thou my unbelief father as we come
[38:04] together Lord and it seems like we
[38:06] always have a need in in but you you're
[38:09] the the eternal God the all all
[38:12] supplying God there's never a time when
[38:15] you run short that that you would put us
[38:17] on hold because you you have to go
[38:20] you'll figure out how to do this Lord
[38:21] but every need supplied Lord and we
[38:24] believe that today we want our motives
[38:26] our heart right before you wherever we
[38:28] are at today listening in Lord maybe
[38:30] some traveling where maybe somewhere are
[38:33] so discouraged today that they said I'm
[38:35] not even going to listen in today I
[38:37] think at times we've all gone to a place
[38:39] where we're just so down and so hurting
[38:42] Lord we just don't feel like we can do
[38:43] anything but Lord let that one just
[38:46] reach out just extend a hand out to your
[38:49] Lord and you'll reach down with them
[38:51] Lord you know that need and we'll give
[38:53] you honor we'll give you glory and we'll
[38:55] give you praise for you alone are worthy
[38:57] in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen you may
[39:01] be seated
[39:03] brother Matt when I sent me on whatsapp
[39:07] here a bit ago saying though that you
[39:09] know that he'll be here next weekend
[39:10] with us so well trusting it'll it'll
[39:14] work out traveling schedules are a
[39:17] little hard right now sometimes they
[39:18] can't fly but that's his desire and it's
[39:21] our desire to they have a mirror
[39:23] you know God has supplies every need
[39:27] he's aiming in our prayer we said God
[39:30] you never run out but I was talking to
[39:32] dad a little before the service and we
[39:34] were talking about how faithful God is
[39:36] and I was sharing it with the brothers
[39:39] and at lunch some of the things that dad
[39:41] had brought us raised us up but he
[39:44] reminded me of one we down in about 400
[39:47] miles south of the border here where we
[39:48] helped build the church down and it
[39:50] about calming and some of you folks got
[39:53] a chance to go down there and visit but
[39:55] they were having a meeting and everybody
[39:58] comes and they need to feed everybody
[40:00] there for their meetings you know and
[40:02] they're poor people of just in a little
[40:04] village not on not a whole lot there and
[40:07] so dad said they're used to going to the
[40:10] store and they can buy two eggs and
[40:12] three tortillas a little because that's
[40:14] all they could afford so dad said I told
[40:16] her let's go let's go buy what you need
[40:18] so they were hesitant and he said I just
[40:21] told him put in the cart everything
[40:23] you're going to need so they did they
[40:25] loaded it up and the people began to
[40:28] come and there was a lot of people and
[40:29] they were feeding and just having a
[40:30] wonderful time and his sister Santos
[40:32] that's the pastor's wife she called my
[40:34] dad over and said come here and she was
[40:36] crying so wet we filled this bowl up
[40:39] this morning with the food and we've
[40:41] been serving everybody and it's just as
[40:44] full as when we started what a mighty
[40:48] God we serve and unfailing God you know
[40:52] sometimes you you limit him you won't
[40:53] let him be gone well let him be gone
[40:55] today I don't know if they made Sara
[40:58] welcome today Danny well I'll make you
[41:00] welcome to Sara good to see her here
[41:03] today God God's been good to us and and
[41:06] what he's done to to help along and and
[41:09] he's an unfailing God so brother for the
[41:13] Aaron will be a ministry and again this
[41:15] this evening and trusting that you'll
[41:17] draw you know Paul say Lord I have
[41:19] needed I felt in my heart we would do a
[41:23] prayer line him
[41:24] I know there's needs if I asked you
[41:29] right now do you have a Nina I'm sure
[41:31] everyone would say yes I do have an
[41:33] either there's something I got a text
[41:35] from someone and say please have Bru the
[41:37] Matt pray for me I'm going through
[41:38] something you know and I'm kind of
[41:43] feeling like let's do a prayer line and
[41:45] everybody come through the prayer line
[41:48] not just one or two but God is more than
[41:52] able to meet that need sometimes maybe
[41:56] we're a little embarrassed sometimes we
[41:59] might have said Lord I've been through
[42:00] that line three times now but what if
[42:03] this is your day God said he would meet
[42:06] supply so if that's the way the Lord
[42:08] leaves well we'll see how he leaves
[42:09] brother Aaron just as he told me is the
[42:11] brother however you feel the Lord needs
[42:13] to do but I know I need more of him I
[42:16] know if I'm willing to say Here I am
[42:18] Lord he says then in coming I will feel
[42:21] you fill you to the uttermost we are
[42:23] heirs of the Father and joint heirs with
[42:26] his son so as we stand his brother and
[42:29] comes out and I don't know about you but

[44:15] sing it to him just just close your eyes
[44:19] whatever just sing it or tell him how
[44:21] much you love it how much you appreciate
[44:23] him and watch him draw an eyedropper
[44:27] [Music]
[44:36] yes I love
[44:42] [Music]
[44:53] praise the Lord if you could take your
[44:57] Bibles I'd like to read from Genesis
[44:58] chapter 1 in a few places and then from
[45:03] Genesis chapter 3 no hope there's no
[45:07] offense I'm here to preach so I'm just
[45:09] gonna get right back into the word and
[45:10] we appreciate being with you today and
[45:13] again grateful for with a privilege that
[45:18] was extended to us by your pastor
[45:19] brother Matthew to be here in minister
[45:21] and I'm very grateful for that and for
[45:24] the kindness that you show us the
[45:25] fellowship that we have we certainly
[45:27] enjoy it I want to just say not from one
[45:32] lawyer to another but from one minister
[45:34] to another congratulations to brother
[45:35] Peter for what he's been able to
[45:37] accomplish and graduated from Law School
[45:39] passing the bar exam and you might as
[45:42] well get ready anytime you ever preach a
[45:44] good sermon there and say well it's
[45:45] because you're a lawyer and I can tell
[45:48] you I've had 20 years of that and I hope
[45:52] that maybe God will work more
[45:53] dynamically through you to where they
[45:55] don't attribute it to your legal
[45:56] training as they have for me and that
[45:58] would be my prayer for you but I admire
[46:01] what the Lord's done in his life not
[46:02] from an academic standpoint or a
[46:04] professional standpoint because there's
[46:05] a lot of people that go to law school
[46:07] graduate pass the bar but there's very
[46:10] very few who do it the way that he did
[46:12] it and I admire that just wanted to say
[46:15] congratulations to you from one son of
[46:17] God to another congratulations and also
[46:20] just want to say this very briefly I
[46:22] just wanted to thank you all for the
[46:26] labor that you undergo to continue some
[46:28] of the legacy that brother Perry the
[46:30] legacy of brother Perry green and in
[46:33] doing making sure certain materials are
[46:36] available and providing the message and
[46:37] the different resources in the message
[46:39] and letting the message remain the focal
[46:41] point and I realized that some of you've
[46:44] been here for decades and I just wanted
[46:45] to thank you and commend you for all
[46:46] that you've done to keep some of these
[46:48] resources available and in keeping this
[46:51] legacy legacy alive it's something that
[46:54] God impressed upon my heart when a
[46:55] couple of my friends passed away over
[46:57] the last few years that your legacy is
[46:59] all that is left
[47:00] you take your character and you leave a
[47:02] legacy and then those of us who
[47:05] remain we are tasked with improving and
[47:08] building upon in and furthering a legacy
[47:11] and then we we we want to push the next
[47:13] generation forward and just thrust them
[47:16] forward with a desire that they would
[47:18] actually exceed and go beyond us and not
[47:21] put them you know restrain them and
[47:24] condemn them and hold them back as if to
[47:26] say well you know we're you can't do
[47:28] more than us you can't do better and
[47:29] that's you Kenny but actually just
[47:31] compel them forward so take what God's
[47:33] done for you take away all the work that
[47:35] God has done through the decades here at
[47:37] Tucson Tabernacle and just take it
[47:40] forward to that great climax of the
[47:42] change of our bodies and just wanted to
[47:44] thank you for those things that you've
[47:46] done to further the spreading of the
[47:48] message and making certain things
[47:50] available to the body of Christ Genesis
[47:52] chapter 1 verse 11 and then also we'll
[47:56] skip to verse 28 and then Genesis
[47:58] chapter 3 and God said let the earth
[48:00] bring forth grass the herb yielding seed
[48:02] and the fruit tree yielding fruit after
[48:05] his kind whose seed is in itself upon
[48:08] the earth and it was so brother Branham
[48:10] calls that God's law of reproduction and
[48:13] then verse 28 God blessed them and
[48:16] they're speaking as he has created man
[48:18] in the image of God and he's made male
[48:21] and female so God is commanding both the
[48:24] male and female though it may be
[48:26] embodied in just their supernatural
[48:29] spirit being of man before he's even
[48:31] formed into flesh is still a commandment
[48:33] that the woman comes under and he says
[48:36] and God blessed them and said unto them
[48:39] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[48:41] the earth and subdue it and have
[48:43] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[48:45] over the fowl of the air and over every
[48:47] living thing that moveth upon the earth
[48:49] and then I'd like to read Genesis
[48:52] chapter 3 verse 15 and I'm not
[48:56] we may not expound upon this too much
[48:59] but I want to read this because this is
[49:02] the promise which revives the
[49:06] commandment of Genesis 1:28 according to
[49:09] Genesis 111 and I'll put enmity between
[49:11] thee and the woman in between thy seed
[49:14] and her seed and we know her seed is cry
[49:19] it's the seed that comes forth from the
[49:21] woman and that they described in that
[49:24] shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[49:26] bruise his heel and so here in even
[49:29] speaking the curse to the serpent he's
[49:32] actually prophesying Redemption and that
[49:35] it would come through Christ and a trust
[49:37] that we can stay in harmony with the
[49:39] message and bring some of these things
[49:41] out that brother branham amplifies on
[49:42] these verses if you could just bow our
[49:44] heads a gracious Heavenly Father thank
[49:46] you for this wonderful evening service
[49:48] to look out upon the congregation and
[49:50] see the many that are gathered together
[49:52] coming in expectation to hear your word
[49:56] even Lord I see brother Peterson and
[49:58] he's coming even just for for more just
[50:02] an extra service having already been a
[50:03] part of his fellowship in his service
[50:05] I'm sure or there's a hunger in your
[50:07] bride today for more word not for
[50:10] politics not for pretence not for
[50:12] popularity not for any carnal pleasure
[50:14] but Lord your bride is hungry for the
[50:17] word and I thank God that there is a an
[50:20] anointing that could come upon men of
[50:22] God to take the word and preach it to
[50:25] satisfy the bride's hunger and the
[50:26] bride's thirst and Lord may we as we
[50:29] feed on this word be changed he turned
[50:31] internally and eternally that it might
[50:33] manifest your great purpose so bless the
[50:35] word which we've read give us a
[50:37] discipline tonight is here and speaker
[50:39] to stay in the channel that you might
[50:41] impart the things that are necessary for
[50:43] us and Lord you take control this
[50:45] service from now to the very end the
[50:47] very close however you would lead your
[50:49] people Lord we believe that you're able
[50:51] to heal hearts and to deliver and to set
[50:53] free we commit it to you now in the name
[50:56] of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen
[50:58] and you may be seated
[50:59] we're gonna just jump right into this
[51:02] and continue on the subject of
[51:03] fulfilling the original finishing God's
[51:07] original purpose for the original
[51:09] creation and we're taking even the
[51:12] statement the threefold purpose of God
[51:14] manifested in Adam and Eve and amplified
[51:17] how that in this endtime the bride is
[51:19] fulfilling the original she is
[51:22] completing her part in the threefold
[51:24] purpose of God how they did the first
[51:27] part the second part come together in
[51:29] the third part
[51:30] and the condition of the Garden of Eden
[51:32] and we're drawing our inspiration from
[51:34] the statement and power of
[51:36] transformation where brother bam said
[51:37] there was Adam and Eve walking in the
[51:39] garden every seed bringing forth and he
[51:41] said there's where we're facing yet and
[51:44] I'm skipping just a little bit but
[51:45] there's where we're facing yet the
[51:47] completion of that word so we are facing
[51:50] today or we are tasked with today the
[51:53] commandment and the responsibility to
[51:55] finish something not completed by Adam
[51:58] and the woman Adam and the woman were
[52:00] under a command they had a purpose they
[52:02] had something they were to accomplish
[52:03] and he's saying we're gonna keep we're
[52:05] gonna do it today whatever was left
[52:07] undone by the man and the woman in the
[52:09] garden the bride with through Christ or
[52:12] Christ through the bride is gonna do it
[52:14] and nothing will be let be left over let
[52:16] nothing will remain and it'll be it'll
[52:19] be brought to a climax and then once
[52:20] that once that transpires then you
[52:23] there's it's almost just like a
[52:25] succession of things that happened God
[52:27] doing housekeeping to get us to that
[52:28] eighth day where we live eternally with
[52:31] our with our Lord there in the heavens
[52:35] new heavens and new earth and those that
[52:37] would all those that would populate
[52:38] outside of the city and then I'd be a
[52:40] just a glory without end so now I want
[52:43] to look at that word as he says that
[52:45] we're facing the completion of that word
[52:47] I want to look at that word to
[52:49] understand what it is that's being
[52:50] fulfilled today what it is that's being
[52:53] completed or finished today and I want
[52:56] to I want to set it this way there was
[52:57] Adam and the woman in Eden under a
[53:01] command of Genesis 1:28 according to the
[53:05] law of reproduction of Genesis 111 so
[53:07] there was a man and a woman in in Eden
[53:10] in a garden in Eden under the command of
[53:13] Genesis 1:28 - to fulfill or to
[53:16] according to the law of reproduction in
[53:19] Genesis 111 and so Genesis 1:28 and I
[53:23] realize also the Lord just very
[53:26] supernaturally did a couple things for
[53:28] me over the last 24 hours to just give
[53:31] me such a peace in a direction to
[53:32] minister on this and just realized I
[53:35] realized it this morning
[53:37] that I preached on some of these very
[53:40] same principles last fall and when I
[53:43] remember in doing so
[53:45] that it was just kind of laying it out
[53:47] there in a very abbreviated way and
[53:48] tonight I just get to expound upon that
[53:51] so if you come away from this saying oh
[53:53] brother Aaron preached that last time he
[53:54] was here I agree with you I'll just
[53:56] accept it you know I just say okay
[53:58] alright is it a compliment or you know
[54:00] but I just want to amplify some of these
[54:03] things a little bit more because I
[54:05] believe that that when we Minister many
[54:08] times you just kind of hit the high
[54:09] points but you could take these things
[54:11] and drill them down on the message and
[54:13] go so deep with them and see that
[54:14] they're there absolutely backed up with
[54:16] Scripture and quote after quote after
[54:18] quote and so the statement the
[54:21] commandment and just went Genesis 1:28
[54:24] god blessed them and said unto them be
[54:26] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[54:30] earth and remember God made the earth
[54:31] for the purpose of getting a bride out
[54:33] of it be fruitful multiply and replenish
[54:35] the earth and subdue it and have
[54:37] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[54:39] over the fowl of the air and over every
[54:41] living thing that moveth upon the earth
[54:43] and so now as we refer to that those
[54:46] silent years all those silent and the
[54:48] scriptures silent on them living out
[54:51] under under this command to subdue and
[54:54] to I have dominion in these things
[54:56] we know that brother Branham shows us
[54:58] that there was perfect harmony there in
[55:00] the Garden of Eden a perfect
[55:01] understanding love of God holiness and
[55:03] perfection and all those things we
[55:05] looked at this morning and so you had
[55:07] man and a woman in a beautiful garden
[55:10] and that was God's masterpiece when God
[55:13] saw that it was very good to him and
[55:15] this is what he envisioned and what he
[55:16] saw and Genesis 1:28 as we made this
[55:19] statement a moment we're just kind of
[55:21] amplify a moment ago we're amplifying
[55:22] this this is according to God's law of
[55:25] reproduction that every seed must bring
[55:27] forth of its own kind at specie it must
[55:31] be reproduced by seed so the certain
[55:33] cattle each genus and then each specie
[55:35] were to bring forth of its own kind and
[55:38] and this is what God's original design
[55:40] was and that's why the original sin is
[55:44] as horrible as it is because it broke
[55:46] God's original commandment that each
[55:49] seed must bring forth of its kind and
[55:51] brother Bram called them the original
[55:53] scent of mongrel isin or a hybrid it was
[55:55] a mixing of seed
[55:57] and that's the great transgression and
[55:59] so it was to bring forth of its own kind
[56:02] and then when God looks upon Adam in
[56:05] verse 18 Genesis chapter 2 verse 18 as
[56:08] they had been formed as one flesh formed
[56:12] as a supernatural spirit being first
[56:14] then that being is put into a body of
[56:16] flesh and then he still sees the one the
[56:19] singular man and he says it is not good
[56:21] that man should be alone I will make a
[56:24] help meet for him
[56:25] in other words though God is expressing
[56:27] himself in creation and though man upon
[56:30] earth was in the likeness of God in
[56:33] heaven he seized this and he says it's
[56:35] not good because God's expression is not
[56:38] complete
[56:39] God's desire was not to have a man that
[56:41] looked like him but to have a bride of
[56:43] his choosing so when he has a man in his
[56:45] own image and he expresses the sentiment
[56:47] that it's not good it's because there
[56:50] was still a further expression of God to
[56:52] be made known and brother Branham says
[56:54] it this way in the masterpiece when God
[56:56] made this man there was something about
[56:58] him yet that didn't look just right I
[57:01] said well what's wrong was his nose too
[57:03] big and and was he not tall enough he
[57:05] says because he was by himself so what
[57:08] wasn't right is that man was by himself
[57:11] if God only desired to have a man who
[57:13] had a woman inside of him that he could
[57:15] fellowship with her spirit inside of him
[57:17] then God was fine in the beginning with
[57:19] his thoughts but because God wanted to
[57:21] give expression to himself and to bring
[57:24] forth the bride it's now reflected and
[57:26] Adam says because he was by himself and
[57:28] that's how God had been by himself he
[57:31] was the eternal and man now in the image
[57:34] of God also existed on earth by himself
[57:37] isn't this a beautiful picture so he
[57:39] must have struck a little blow over the
[57:41] left side and from there he took a piece
[57:42] that struck off of it and made him a
[57:45] helpmate a wife then he wasn't by
[57:47] himself he had somebody with him he says
[57:50] and that's his great work so God's great
[57:54] work wasn't just creating the the
[57:56] galaxies and all the heavens and the
[57:58] stars and bringing forth the earth and
[58:00] creation in all cattle and all sorts of
[58:02] living beasts upon the earth and then
[58:04] creating man and setting him forth in on
[58:06] the earth but his great work was to
[58:08] actually
[58:09] bring out of Adam the woman not another
[58:13] creation but the further expression of
[58:15] the same creation and so now Adam and
[58:18] woman are a further expression of God
[58:20] the Adam was an expression of God but
[58:23] there still was a hidden mystery in Adam
[58:25] and that was the wife that was the woman
[58:28] and so it's a clearer more complete
[58:31] portrait of who God is and as the
[58:34] scripture says in verse 22 of chapter
[58:36] two in the rib which the Lord God had
[58:38] taken from a man made he a woman and
[58:40] brought her unto the man and brother BAM
[58:43] comments on that scripture says he is
[58:45] showing portrayed here the bride so when
[58:49] he takes the rib and he makes a woman
[58:50] brother man said he's portraying or
[58:52] showing the bride what God was actually
[58:55] wanting to do is do something in the
[58:58] beginning that the bride today could
[59:01] look back and seeing the word and say
[59:03] what he did to Adam he is doubt now
[59:06] brought me forth through Christ to give
[59:09] us the benefit of the end time to look
[59:11] back and see everything God has done and
[59:13] even brings to the back part of God's
[59:15] mind and see it all unfold before the
[59:17] beginning of time before there was a
[59:19] speck of Stardust before God had even
[59:21] formed himself to the logos and see that
[59:23] he had a singular purpose and desire to
[59:26] have you and so he said he's showing
[59:29] here portrayed here the bride so he
[59:31] brings forth to help me and this help
[59:33] meet as we looked at last fall and I
[59:36] know you all remember it perfectly
[59:38] some of you were thinking oh he was here
[59:40] before oops you forgot but he's via help
[59:46] mean it needs to be one who's at hand
[59:47] who's always near who's ready to help
[59:50] ready to please weather ready to comfort
[59:52] and the very word the very Hebrew word
[59:55] means one before him as in a mirror so
[59:59] it's it's not the exact replica but it's
[1:00:02] an opposite so when you see yourself in
[1:00:05] the mirror you see a reverse image or an
[1:00:07] opposite and so that's kind of the image
[1:00:10] that they're saying about the woman she
[1:00:11] wasn't exactly like him
[1:00:13] but it was the opposite so that there
[1:00:15] was it was complimentary to him one
[1:00:18] before him and actually the word
[1:00:20] suggests a second self the
[1:00:22] the woman was one who is a second self
[1:00:24] of Adam to help him in the labor she was
[1:00:26] a perfect resemblance of the man she was
[1:00:28] neither inferior nor superior but in all
[1:00:31] things she was like and equal to him but
[1:00:33] opposite and brother branham said in the
[1:00:35] beginning the woman was made co-equal
[1:00:37] with the man it is only through the fall
[1:00:40] that she has made lower and becomes a
[1:00:42] weaker vessel but she was co-equal under
[1:00:44] the original marriage covenant it was
[1:00:46] the man and the woman co-equal in the
[1:00:49] beginning and when a man and the woman
[1:00:52] is brought into the man he says this was
[1:00:53] now bone of my bones and she's flesh of
[1:00:55] my flesh she shall be called woman not
[1:00:58] not not because whoa man but woman
[1:01:00] because she came from man she was taken
[1:01:03] out of the man and he's decided that
[1:01:06] they were both naked the man and the
[1:01:08] woman the man and his wife and were not
[1:01:10] ashamed
[1:01:11] God is foreshadowing that eternal Eden
[1:01:14] of Christ in his bride says therefore
[1:01:16] shall a man leave his father and mother
[1:01:18] and cleave unto his wife and they shall
[1:01:20] be one flesh and this is still a mystery
[1:01:23] the mystery of one flesh and brother
[1:01:26] branham says in the rising of the Sun
[1:01:27] and he being the groom the bride has to
[1:01:29] come forth because it's part of him and
[1:01:31] it can only be the man at the station of
[1:01:34] the fulfilling of all the revelations
[1:01:37] heady men this is the bride the bride
[1:01:40] has to come forth and she's the
[1:01:41] manifestation of the fulfilling of all
[1:01:43] the revelations any others have spoke of
[1:01:45] the bride it can only manifest that does
[1:01:48] something different from the groom it
[1:01:49] isn't the bride because she is flesh of
[1:01:51] his flesh bone of his bone life of his
[1:01:54] life power of his power she is him
[1:01:59] let's not water it down let's not try to
[1:02:02] qualify it don't even try to figure it
[1:02:03] out we don't need to resolve the paradox
[1:02:05] how can she be him just accept it say
[1:02:08] man I believe it she is him and that's
[1:02:13] how we the bride is portrayed here in
[1:02:16] Genesis chapter 2 when the woman comes
[1:02:18] forth bone of his bone flesh and his
[1:02:20] flesh life of his life power of his
[1:02:22] power the bride she is him and so the
[1:02:25] Adam and the woman were God's first
[1:02:27] masterpiece the man and the woman in a
[1:02:30] perfect Eden with a
[1:02:32] mission so it wasn't that God was
[1:02:35] satisfied the man and the woman all I'm
[1:02:37] satisfied and in its complete no they
[1:02:40] were under a commission so when God
[1:02:43] looked upon the man of the woman in
[1:02:44] Garden of Eden he loved this world this
[1:02:47] is what God loved because the Bible said
[1:02:50] for God so loved the world that He gave
[1:02:52] His only begotten Son that whosoever
[1:02:54] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:02:55] should have everlasting life now that
[1:02:58] that says that God loved the world we
[1:03:00] accept that right but then John writes
[1:03:03] and says love not the world nor the
[1:03:05] things of the world because if you love
[1:03:06] the world the love of the father's not
[1:03:07] in you so now we've got a problem
[1:03:11] God so loved the world that He died for
[1:03:13] it but now you're told that if you love
[1:03:16] it
[1:03:17] you don't have the love of God in you
[1:03:18] and the reason is because we don't
[1:03:22] understand what the world was that God
[1:03:24] loved this is the world that God loved
[1:03:26] the world that He created in the
[1:03:28] beginning brother man said his soul
[1:03:29] pleased him when he saw his creation
[1:03:31] that even just went to rest put him
[1:03:33] under the commandment you guys bring
[1:03:35] forth and so the Garden of Eden is the
[1:03:37] enclosure of God's delight this is the
[1:03:40] world that God loved this is the world
[1:03:42] that God brought forth this was the
[1:03:44] world that was only his spoken word
[1:03:46] under creation under manifestation under
[1:03:49] Authority in manifesting the very
[1:03:52] purpose of God with the Commission to
[1:03:54] unfold and bring forth every son or
[1:03:56] daughter of God that would ever be
[1:03:57] that's the world that God loved same
[1:04:00] enters in and defiles it and it enters
[1:04:02] into a fallen State God so loved that
[1:04:04] world that He gave His only begotten Son
[1:04:07] to redeem that world and to bring you
[1:04:09] back to that world Genesis 1:28 again
[1:04:17] God blessed them and said unto them be
[1:04:19] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[1:04:22] earth and subdue it so part of God's
[1:04:25] original purpose
[1:04:27] we completely realized then that part of
[1:04:30] God's original purpose is not just a man
[1:04:32] and a woman but a man a woman and their
[1:04:36] seed the expression the progeny the
[1:04:39] fruit of their union God did not just
[1:04:42] contemplate man and
[1:04:44] on an eternal date in this wonderful
[1:04:48] Adam no kids no that's not the way he
[1:04:50] envisioned it he envisioned a the
[1:04:53] setting where the man and the woman
[1:04:55] would bring forth now I trust that you
[1:04:58] just stay very close to what I'm trying
[1:04:59] to say tonight because we understand and
[1:05:02] we know the things that brother branham
[1:05:03] says that even says that the woman would
[1:05:06] have eventually brought forth that child
[1:05:08] referring to Christ so and this is not
[1:05:10] in in an absolute sense that the way
[1:05:13] that was the way that it was supposed to
[1:05:15] be but in the way that it was designed
[1:05:17] that's the way it would have been
[1:05:19] that's what brother Branham I believe
[1:05:20] brother man means what he says that is
[1:05:22] not that that's what it was supposed to
[1:05:24] be that had it not been interrupted
[1:05:26] that's what it would have been and so we
[1:05:28] know them that God's original design and
[1:05:30] purpose was not just to have a man and a
[1:05:32] woman who were married and nothing else
[1:05:35] but they were to bring forth children
[1:05:36] and it says this it's in the very
[1:05:40] commandment that we should recognize
[1:05:41] this in Genesis chapter 2 verse 24
[1:05:44] therefore shall a man leave now notice
[1:05:47] this this prophecy that comes forward
[1:05:49] the woman is formed and she comes out of
[1:05:51] Adam and then when the woman is brought
[1:05:54] to the man under inspiration the
[1:05:56] Scriptures begins to speak for this
[1:05:58] cause shall a man leave his father and
[1:06:01] his mother so it immediately begins to
[1:06:04] imply that there has to be more to the
[1:06:07] original commandment than just a man and
[1:06:09] a woman they have to become fathers and
[1:06:12] mothers therefore shall a man leave his
[1:06:15] father and his mother and shall cleave
[1:06:17] unto his wife and they shall be one
[1:06:19] flesh
[1:06:20] now there's no question that you can see
[1:06:22] in type or in symbol that Adam left his
[1:06:26] father and even Mother Earth to redeem
[1:06:28] his wife but it is intended in the
[1:06:31] original bringing forth of the woman
[1:06:32] that there would be a son who would have
[1:06:35] to leave mother and father and cleave to
[1:06:37] his own wife therefore shall a man leave
[1:06:40] his father and mother so Clevelanders
[1:06:42] wife and they shall be one flesh now how
[1:06:46] is it they become one flesh you follow
[1:06:49] me in this and that this is where it
[1:06:51] just becomes very natural to understand
[1:06:54] this when you take a man
[1:06:55] and a woman and especially Adam and the
[1:06:58] woman it would be all Adam would be one
[1:07:01] DNA sequence and the woman would it be
[1:07:03] entirely made up of everything that was
[1:07:06] in Adam so the woman comes from Adam if
[1:07:09] they were to bring forth the son it
[1:07:12] would be a reproduction of the man again
[1:07:14] and the flesh of the woman and the flesh
[1:07:17] of the man are now reproduced in the
[1:07:19] children because they become one flesh
[1:07:22] you can't divide that's why when people
[1:07:24] say well who do you think the baby looks
[1:07:26] like and I said well that baby looks
[1:07:28] like what a baby would look like if that
[1:07:29] man and that woman had a baby because
[1:07:33] that's what it looks like well it's got
[1:07:34] his daddy's eyes and it's got his
[1:07:35] mother's nose and we'll try to separate
[1:07:38] that out and it's because they were
[1:07:40] joined together and rejoined in the
[1:07:43] flesh in brother branham makes this
[1:07:46] statement in marriage and divorce we're
[1:07:48] speaking about a woman having a child he
[1:07:50] says then she becomes a part of this man
[1:07:54] think about that he's talking about
[1:07:56] having children since then she becomes a
[1:07:58] part of this man and he's through it's
[1:08:00] through child buried according to first
[1:08:02] Timothy 2:15 that is how the woman
[1:08:05] becomes a permanent part of the man when
[1:08:08] she brings forth the child and now you
[1:08:10] can see even how this act of redemption
[1:08:12] that brother Branham said that God could
[1:08:15] have destroyed the woman and could have
[1:08:17] judged even burned her up but what Adam
[1:08:20] did oh my just think of it what Adam did
[1:08:22] is he had deposited a part of himself
[1:08:25] and to the woman and God could not judge
[1:08:28] the woman because now she's a part of
[1:08:30] the man again and he cannot strike her
[1:08:34] with judgment so this part of the
[1:08:38] original this is part of the original
[1:08:40] word and so the word signified that
[1:08:42] there was to be more to this masterpiece
[1:08:44] are you keeping with me so far and
[1:08:48] that's oh and listen I know that it may
[1:08:51] be the manner of some to say you know
[1:08:53] saying man say Amen but listen if I if I
[1:08:56] ever do that where I said say hey man
[1:08:59] don't you dare say it unless you can a
[1:09:01] man it just because the preacher says
[1:09:03] say man only say a man if the word says
[1:09:05] it only if the Holy Ghost and you can
[1:09:07] punctuate every word of
[1:09:09] God within a man because sometimes I
[1:09:11] know what it's like a brother was like
[1:09:12] can you say man to that you'd be like
[1:09:17] you're just waiting for him say do you
[1:09:19] love the Lord you're going yes yes I do
[1:09:21] I do that do that so if you can if it's
[1:09:24] according to the word feel free to
[1:09:26] express your a man's and I'm doing I
[1:09:28] want to stay faithful to the message and
[1:09:31] so I'm expressing something in this that
[1:09:33] brother branham it being very delicate
[1:09:35] with it
[1:09:35] brother branham it teaches us these
[1:09:37] things and here the scripture is showing
[1:09:40] us that there's going to be a union and
[1:09:41] they shall be one flesh and so brother
[1:09:44] Branham writes it this way in the
[1:09:46] pergamene church age the first son Adam
[1:09:48] was the spoken seed word of God he was
[1:09:51] given a bride to reproduce himself that
[1:09:54] is why the bride was given to him to
[1:09:56] reproduce himself to produce another son
[1:09:59] of God so the woman was not there just
[1:10:02] to pat him on the back and then whisper
[1:10:05] in his ear and tell him how handsome he
[1:10:06] was and how strong he was and say oh
[1:10:08] honey could you just make the wind blow
[1:10:10] a little softer no she was there to
[1:10:13] assist him in his labor and his purpose
[1:10:15] because they were under a commandment to
[1:10:17] multiply and replace the earth be
[1:10:20] fruitful multiply and replenish the
[1:10:22] earth and she's there to produce another
[1:10:24] son of God in the original image so she
[1:10:28] was to bring forth another son in the
[1:10:30] original image now if you want to bring
[1:10:32] that begin to bring that down to our day
[1:10:34] and I'll try to do this more in more
[1:10:36] detail later
[1:10:37] that's why brother Branham says
[1:10:39] denominations cannot bring forth
[1:10:41] children because they're hybrid they're
[1:10:44] not back to the original that's why we
[1:10:46] had to be restored back to the original
[1:10:48] so that sons and daughters could be
[1:10:50] reproduced again under a word birth
[1:10:52] there is not a birth that can take place
[1:10:54] in organized religion there's not a
[1:10:57] birth that can come forth in
[1:10:58] denominations because it's a hybrid
[1:11:00] daughter of a harlot they cannot produce
[1:11:03] sons and daughters of God it's got to be
[1:11:06] through the original word again
[1:11:08] otherwise it's hybrid all is its
[1:11:11] mongrelized so in when when the
[1:11:14] scripture says well I want to make to
[1:11:16] help me again I know that I ministered
[1:11:18] on the subject when I spoke last year
[1:11:20] and again I know you remember it
[1:11:21] perfectly
[1:11:22] on the glory of the son of men how'd
[1:11:24] that he he had a work that he was to do
[1:11:27] he says I'll make a help meet for him
[1:11:28] and then in Genesis chapter 2 verses 18
[1:11:31] to 20
[1:11:32] it describes Adam working by himself
[1:11:35] God brought all the beasts of the field
[1:11:37] and all the cattle and Adam named all of
[1:11:39] them because there was a work that he
[1:11:41] could do by himself and there was a lot
[1:11:44] that he could accomplish by himself but
[1:11:47] yet there was a work that he could not
[1:11:49] do by himself Adam could not finish all
[1:11:53] the work that he was given without the
[1:11:55] woman Adam couldn't say well I'm to be
[1:11:59] fruitful multiply and replaced your
[1:12:00] bless God who needs somebody I can do
[1:12:02] this on my own
[1:12:03] no every time Adam saw a male a bull
[1:12:06] every time he saw Mel a specie he's like
[1:12:09] oh there's a female male female male
[1:12:11] female male female male female and no
[1:12:13] doubt him it it must something much the
[1:12:15] register to him and was identifying with
[1:12:17] this pattern in this image and he knew
[1:12:19] there's got to come a further expression
[1:12:21] in order for me to fulfill my purpose
[1:12:23] according to Genesis 111 and according
[1:12:25] to Genesis 1:28 so Genesis 1:28 required
[1:12:30] a wife it required it and so brother
[1:12:35] Branham speaking of Jesus he said he did
[1:12:37] not complete all his work while in his
[1:12:39] earthly ministry so now he works in and
[1:12:41] through the bride
[1:12:42] she knows that fruit was not yet time
[1:12:44] for him to do certain things that he
[1:12:46] must do now but he will now fulfill
[1:12:48] through the bride that work which he
[1:12:51] left for this specific time so there is
[1:12:55] a work which are which means there are
[1:12:57] certain things for a specific time there
[1:13:02] is something that must be done now that
[1:13:04] all that he could only do through his
[1:13:06] wife and this is and remember what is
[1:13:08] the woman for to reproduce the image of
[1:13:11] God
[1:13:12] so Adam had to have a woman to reproduce
[1:13:14] the image of God through entry entered
[1:13:17] reproduce to even the image of himself
[1:13:19] and brother branham's using a language
[1:13:21] that tells us that God has to bring
[1:13:23] forth the wife in this hour in order to
[1:13:26] do something that he could not do by
[1:13:28] himself and if he raises up a bride the
[1:13:31] bride's purpose is to reproduce the
[1:13:33] image of God
[1:13:34] to bring forth Jesus Christ again that's
[1:13:39] her responsibility that's why we can see
[1:13:42] with such a beautiful type and Ruth how
[1:13:44] she brings forth that child she brings
[1:13:47] forth that that seed and then that seed
[1:13:49] is introduced to the - Naomi which is a
[1:13:51] type of a juice this bride must bring
[1:13:53] forth Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:13:55] today and forever because that's what
[1:13:58] the woman is for now when we look at
[1:14:02] we're looking at that word in order to
[1:14:05] understand what's being finished and
[1:14:07] when the original word was marred it
[1:14:10] identifies how that word is being
[1:14:12] completed today so if something was
[1:14:14] interrupted but it's gonna be finished
[1:14:16] today if we look at the interruption
[1:14:18] then we can understand what needs to be
[1:14:19] continued if we look how it was changed
[1:14:22] then identifies how it's gonna be
[1:14:24] brought back to the original to fulfill
[1:14:26] the original and brother Branham says in
[1:14:28] spoken words the original seed notice
[1:14:31] what happened to Eve's children the
[1:14:32] first one that was born God said
[1:14:34] multiplied to his bride to add a bride
[1:14:37] replenish multiply and replenish the
[1:14:39] earth that was God's commission and she
[1:14:42] would have done it and he would mixing
[1:14:45] themselves together but what happened
[1:14:48] when Adam got ready to come to her she
[1:14:50] was already a mother I'm quoting spoken
[1:14:54] words the original seed this is what
[1:14:55] brother Branham said that she would have
[1:14:57] done it and he would have done it and
[1:14:58] through some means of mixing themselves
[1:15:00] together but when he got ready to come
[1:15:02] to her she was already found with seed
[1:15:04] impregnated an brother Branham says it
[1:15:07] this way Adams bride could not wait God
[1:15:10] had told Adam and Eve multiply replenish
[1:15:13] the earth it was an oncoming thing a
[1:15:16] promise so it was an oncoming promise
[1:15:18] that under a certain time in a certain
[1:15:20] season they would come together under
[1:15:23] the Word of God and she would bring
[1:15:25] forth the child he says it was on coming
[1:15:27] but she didn't wait she was not his wife
[1:15:30] and now he's using a language to suggest
[1:15:32] there's a further consummation or
[1:15:34] unfolding an expression of this
[1:15:36] relationship she was not his wife as of
[1:15:39] yet because he had not lived with her he
[1:15:43] says she got in a hurry and what did she
[1:15:46] do now listen tell you this is
[1:15:48] I'm not saying this I'm just gonna stay
[1:15:50] just stay with how he said it let the
[1:15:52] Holy Spirit kind of amplify these things
[1:15:55] to you and connect these things together
[1:15:56] he says she got in a hurry what did she
[1:15:58] do she crossed her seed she mingled it
[1:16:01] with the serpent seed
[1:16:02] she brought a child of death and she
[1:16:04] perverted every child after that so even
[1:16:09] any subsequent conception by Adam
[1:16:11] perverts everything that comes forward
[1:16:13] because she got in a hurry and shifted
[1:16:16] the time frame and now it's no longer
[1:16:18] the man and a woman according to God's
[1:16:21] timing according to God's Word but it
[1:16:23] has now dropped down into a death
[1:16:25] sentence and and a carnal unfolding of
[1:16:28] recreation so it says here let me take
[1:16:32] this these handkerchiefs he says here is
[1:16:34] a man that was supposed to be right here
[1:16:36] this is a man that was supposed to be
[1:16:38] what happened Eve hybrid it read it and
[1:16:42] what it did well then what did it do it
[1:16:44] turned to death and just keep dying so
[1:16:47] then he says and here stays the word
[1:16:50] just the same
[1:16:51] here's the word lain here just the same
[1:16:54] now what happened now there's a man that
[1:16:56] comes forth but he's hybrid so he dies
[1:16:59] but now brother BAM says the word of
[1:17:01] Genesis 1:28 he says it just lays here
[1:17:05] it's not in that man that's been
[1:17:07] recreated he's not in that man that's
[1:17:10] born of the woman he is laying in here
[1:17:12] this commandment slain he says what
[1:17:14] happened here's the word the word that
[1:17:16] God spoke to multiply replenish the
[1:17:18] earth it couldn't find a place to land
[1:17:21] so now what we've done is we've
[1:17:24] identified the promise that's unfinished
[1:17:27] that the man and the woman did not
[1:17:30] finish this part of the commandment
[1:17:32] because that word never found a place to
[1:17:34] land it never came into the womb he says
[1:17:36] multiply and replenish it couldn't find
[1:17:38] a place to land and it's beautiful when
[1:17:41] you think about multiply and replenish
[1:17:43] earth be fruitful and it being fruitful
[1:17:46] you're going to multiply and so through
[1:17:48] multiplication it's a reproduction of
[1:17:52] the the original and it produces but
[1:17:55] then it says be fruitful multiply and
[1:17:57] then replenish the earth that means to
[1:18:00] be full
[1:18:01] or accomplished accomplish the purpose
[1:18:04] of the earth replenish it - it's in
[1:18:06] fulfil accomplished or complete the
[1:18:08] purpose of the earth so God had
[1:18:10] envisioned in the beginning that there
[1:18:12] would be sons and daughters of God that
[1:18:14] would come forth by the word and they
[1:18:16] never fulfilled that commandment but
[1:18:19] there will be a people understand on
[1:18:21] earth in this hour who through the body
[1:18:23] will come forth the finished seed of
[1:18:26] God's original purpose do you realise
[1:18:29] what a promise this means and I just
[1:18:32] want to say this I with great
[1:18:34] inspiration don't desire just a child
[1:18:37] but desire a child of God because that's
[1:18:40] what we bring forth in this hour is not
[1:18:42] mere progeny after the flesh but it is
[1:18:45] our promise in this hour that we bring
[1:18:47] four sons and daughters of God sorry so
[1:18:54] it's to be replenish and if I could put
[1:18:58] it this way the great purpose of God was
[1:19:01] left pregnant in the earth and I needn't
[1:19:04] so and then he left man and woman to
[1:19:06] finish it he wanted he said now I've
[1:19:10] commanded you I've given you all the
[1:19:11] means at the appointed time your to
[1:19:15] bring forth your to reproduce but she
[1:19:17] gets out of step and she gets too far
[1:19:19] ahead of God's program and it changes
[1:19:22] everything
[1:19:23] I'm brother Branham that teaches us that
[1:19:27] the first as I mentioned a moment ago
[1:19:29] the first son Adam was a spoken seed
[1:19:31] Word of God and he was given a word
[1:19:33] bride to reproduce himself and that's
[1:19:36] what she was given to him for to produce
[1:19:38] another son of God he says but she fell
[1:19:41] by hybridization she caused him to die
[1:19:45] that's what the first Adam and the first
[1:19:48] woman did under commandment a
[1:19:51] commandment that's never fulfilled so
[1:19:54] what they do actually brings us into a
[1:19:56] hybrid of reproduction and it causes
[1:20:00] mankind to die now that's the first Adam
[1:20:03] then the second Adam Christ is given a
[1:20:06] wife right that church is born on the
[1:20:10] day of Pentecost she is a spoken-- she
[1:20:13] is a spoken-- seed word give
[1:20:15] to Christ just like Adam was but before
[1:20:19] Christ could marry her she also Falls
[1:20:23] that's what brother branham taught us so
[1:20:26] just as the woman was given to Adam and
[1:20:27] they never reproduced according to
[1:20:29] commandment God gives Christ a bride but
[1:20:33] before he says he couldn't marry her she
[1:20:35] had also fallen so that means there's
[1:20:38] even a purpose to the woman that was
[1:20:41] left unsatisfied because there'd never
[1:20:43] been a union so when brother Branham
[1:20:45] preaches the invisible union of the
[1:20:47] bride to Christ and says the marriage
[1:20:49] takes place here all there ought to be a
[1:20:51] shout and a hallelujah to realize what
[1:20:54] God has done today has never been done
[1:20:57] before for the Benham says in future
[1:21:02] home now that you could think deep about
[1:21:04] this he says then what happened
[1:21:05] he said Adam and Eve here on earth and
[1:21:07] said multiply now and replenish the
[1:21:09] earth their bodies was all laid out here
[1:21:12] for you to eat and make your body that's
[1:21:15] the way that he had of doing it but sin
[1:21:18] come along and interrupted his plan she
[1:21:20] rolls right on just the same time does
[1:21:23] so God had this plan of how this would
[1:21:26] unfold but then Satan comes in and my
[1:21:29] sin here interrupts his plan so once the
[1:21:33] plan is interrupted and now it's been
[1:21:35] hybrid and she's fallen the woman has
[1:21:37] fallen Adam cannot finish the
[1:21:39] commandment then we're told that the
[1:21:42] same thing happens once the church comes
[1:21:44] forth and before he could have an
[1:21:45] invisible union with her she has also
[1:21:48] fallen so the original purpose cannot be
[1:21:50] completed in the church so now do you
[1:21:52] realize even more what it means when the
[1:21:54] originals restored in this hour and the
[1:21:56] the Alpha bride has become an Omega
[1:21:58] bride it's not just so that we can act
[1:22:00] like the original but we can finish the
[1:22:02] original so then once the original has
[1:22:07] fallen when he speaks the curse to the
[1:22:11] serpent he says i'll put enmity between
[1:22:13] thee and the woman genesis 3:15 and
[1:22:15] between thy seed and her seed and it
[1:22:18] shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[1:22:20] bruise his heel this is a prophecy of
[1:22:24] the restoration of that word
[1:22:27] because now when he says that the seed
[1:22:30] of the woman her seed
[1:22:32] there'll be enmity between thy seed and
[1:22:34] her seed the I seed is a hybrid seed
[1:22:37] that the whole the whole populated has
[1:22:39] been populated by fallen man and so he's
[1:22:42] not talking about a literal seed gene on
[1:22:44] earth where we have to do all these DNA
[1:22:46] tests and we all subscribe to 23andme
[1:22:49] and hey guess what it came back I go
[1:22:50] right back to Adam no that's not the way
[1:22:54] that this works but he's going to do
[1:22:56] something new and Christ is going to be
[1:22:59] a new creation he's going to be the
[1:23:00] beginning of the creation of God not
[1:23:03] just Adams race patched up but it's
[1:23:06] going to be something new to unfold it's
[1:23:08] and it's going to be through that that
[1:23:10] there's redemption to Adams race but
[1:23:12] it's a it's this prophecy is a
[1:23:14] restoration of that word because genesis
[1:23:18] 3:15 is the seed of Genesis 1:28 he
[1:23:22] revives the original plan and the
[1:23:25] original purpose of God because when
[1:23:28] Christ comes he comes as a new creation
[1:23:31] he comes as the son of God he comes as
[1:23:34] the last Adam - what revived the
[1:23:36] original commandment bring back up what
[1:23:39] was in the beginning and restored back
[1:23:41] to man everything that had been lost in
[1:23:42] the fall and now they be there's a a
[1:23:46] beautiful type that we can see in here
[1:23:49] before Adam could come to the woman the
[1:23:51] II Eve had been be guided by the serpent
[1:23:54] but now when Kirk God is going to
[1:23:56] foreshadow the rib the redemption of
[1:23:59] Genesis 1:28 before Joseph comes to Mary
[1:24:02] she had already received seed from God
[1:24:06] brother man says the word of promise
[1:24:08] came to the Virgin Mary but that word of
[1:24:11] promise was he himself to be made
[1:24:12] manifest God was made manifest
[1:24:15] he himself acted at that time and
[1:24:18] fulfilled his own word of promise in the
[1:24:20] Virgin so think of the dynamics and the
[1:24:23] mechanics now the word of promise came
[1:24:25] to the Virgin Mary the word of promise
[1:24:27] was he himself to be made manifest God
[1:24:30] was made manifested he himself acted at
[1:24:33] that time and fulfilled his own word of
[1:24:35] promise in the Virgin now what was he
[1:24:37] foreshadowing
[1:24:38] the bringing forth of the bridegroom to
[1:24:41] be able to fulfill the original purpose
[1:24:44] of bridegroom bride in a garden of eden'
[1:24:47] so then he says I'm the word here is the
[1:24:50] secret of this the word is in the bride
[1:24:54] as it wasn't married that means it's the
[1:24:56] word of promise that he himself is to be
[1:25:00] made manifest God is to be made manifest
[1:25:02] he himself has acted at his time to
[1:25:06] fulfill his word of promise in the
[1:25:08] virgin bride here is the secret the word
[1:25:11] is in the bride why because it's the
[1:25:15] woman that came out of that man
[1:25:17] and God had to bring forth a man apart
[1:25:20] from human instrumentality had to bring
[1:25:23] forth the Son of God apart from man
[1:25:25] apart from woman apart from Adam's race
[1:25:27] apart from any of the gene or blood of
[1:25:31] those of those who had the hybrid
[1:25:33] creatures and he brought forth the
[1:25:35] Virgin born son of God who is the very
[1:25:38] DNA of God why there had to be a bride
[1:25:41] man in order for there to be a bride
[1:25:43] woman Jesus Christ was the restoration
[1:25:49] of the original bridegroom and the bride
[1:25:51] is the restoration of the original woman
[1:25:53] and now he says the word is in the bride
[1:25:55] as it was in Mary so Mary reflects
[1:25:59] something she doesn't fulfill it
[1:26:00] completely or perfectly she reflects
[1:26:02] something the word is in the bride as it
[1:26:05] was in Mary what it married is she gave
[1:26:07] birth to the son of God so if the word
[1:26:10] is in the bride is it wasn't Mary you've
[1:26:12] got to give birth I've been thinking
[1:26:16] about the Cova 19 right now
[1:26:18] I caught a revelation of what the 19 is
[1:26:20] it's the 19 pounds I gained over the
[1:26:22] last three months and so my youngest
[1:26:25] jackal put his hands on my belly in he's
[1:26:27] like man you're getting big and you know
[1:26:29] he's thinking I'm pregnant now and you
[1:26:31] know what we are we're expecting wow
[1:26:36] we're gonna do the full word is
[1:26:37] delivered through this bride how good
[1:26:43] wonderful I've got plenty of time
[1:26:45] now in the super sign I just want to
[1:26:47] read these statements just to nail this
[1:26:49] down very very tight but the man says
[1:26:51] God the great contractor had laid all
[1:26:53] had all the bodies laid out here on
[1:26:55] earth of calcium Potter's patrolling he
[1:26:59] was going to create it and make it but
[1:27:01] she bypassed the way of God what did
[1:27:05] Adam do when he come to his wife when he
[1:27:06] calmed her he found her pregnant of an
[1:27:08] evil conception had received foul seed
[1:27:10] now we can all accept that about the
[1:27:13] woman right who is now later named Eve
[1:27:16] after she conceived and became the
[1:27:17] mother of all living not necessarily as
[1:27:20] the crown of righteousness but a crown
[1:27:22] of unrighteousness and that wasn't that
[1:27:26] wasn't to be
[1:27:28] that wasn't a righteous designation for
[1:27:30] her at that time and we could accept
[1:27:32] that about the woman but listen to how
[1:27:34] profound brother Branham now applies
[1:27:36] this to Christ
[1:27:37] Jehovah before he could marry his wife
[1:27:41] did the same thing and Jesus before he
[1:27:45] could get to his bride
[1:27:46] she had organized herself and become the
[1:27:49] Roman Catholic Church same thing that's
[1:27:52] heavy that I mean that is that as a
[1:27:56] prophet bringing it into these terms
[1:27:58] that you want to be very careful to stay
[1:28:00] behind these designations in these
[1:28:02] qualifications but just as the first
[1:28:04] woman had fallen the first church and
[1:28:06] all her glory and all her splendor and
[1:28:08] everything that she was she had also
[1:28:10] fallen before he could marry her so
[1:28:12] there was a further expression of the
[1:28:14] relationship of Christ to his bride that
[1:28:17] was not fulfilled in the Alpha but will
[1:28:19] be fulfilled in the Omega oh I thank God
[1:28:23] that I'm here on earth bringing this to
[1:28:25] pass before Jesus could get to his bride
[1:28:30] should organized herself but he will
[1:28:32] have a bride don't you worry that will
[1:28:35] be bought with his word just exactly
[1:28:38] what he told Eve to stay with he will
[1:28:40] have a church amen
[1:28:42] that will be bought by his word he will
[1:28:46] have a bride that will bring forth the
[1:28:48] entire Word of God in its fullest he
[1:28:50] will have a bride that often stay
[1:28:52] faithful to the commandment he will
[1:28:53] finally have a woman that fulfills the
[1:28:56] Commission
[1:28:58] he will have a bride there's been many
[1:29:00] churches churches Brides Brides but
[1:29:02] there must come one he says an invisible
[1:29:06] union a woman is entrusted with certain
[1:29:09] characters that she must not defile a
[1:29:11] woman is trusted to that there's not a
[1:29:14] creature on earth like a woman there's
[1:29:16] no female dog no female of any kind
[1:29:18] entrusted with the character that a
[1:29:19] woman is a woman was not even in the
[1:29:22] beginning of the creation because God
[1:29:25] node that she would fall now I realize
[1:29:29] it's a paradox God simply made it that
[1:29:32] way now if it could help you God knew
[1:29:36] that she would fall he knew that that
[1:29:38] woman would fall but he also knew you
[1:29:41] wouldn't all other females could not
[1:29:46] commit adultery she's the only one that
[1:29:48] can commit adultery if she had been like
[1:29:50] the original that would have been disk
[1:29:52] complementary to God's great wisdom in
[1:29:56] other words if she had not been placed
[1:29:57] on the basis that she could fall that
[1:30:00] would have not been a complement to
[1:30:01] God's plan or purpose in the wisdom he
[1:30:03] had because he wanted to express
[1:30:05] attributes didn't he say that God had to
[1:30:08] predestinate a man who required
[1:30:09] salvation or in order to give him
[1:30:12] purpose and reason of being so if he had
[1:30:14] placed him on the basis that they would
[1:30:15] never fall God would have been lacking
[1:30:17] in fulfillment so he says if she'd been
[1:30:21] like the original that would have not
[1:30:22] complemented God's great wisdom she was
[1:30:24] a byproduct of man he says but because
[1:30:28] she was cashed over in that side now if
[1:30:33] I could express it this way because she
[1:30:36] was cast in that role because she was
[1:30:40] asked to play that part
[1:30:42] the woman was put on the basis that she
[1:30:46] I tell you it just moves me she was
[1:30:48] placed on the basis that she would play
[1:30:51] the part of a harlot and she acted in
[1:30:55] that as if she was moved upon and she
[1:30:58] was defiled and she allowed herself to
[1:31:00] be defiled and we viewed the woman has
[1:31:02] been evil and acting with great
[1:31:04] perversion and she's been deceived but
[1:31:06] it was as if she was asked to play that
[1:31:09] part and
[1:31:10] played that role so that Adams something
[1:31:13] could be brought out of Adam so that
[1:31:15] once we see it portrayed in Adam we
[1:31:18] would know that our bridegroom would do
[1:31:21] the same thing for us but even though we
[1:31:24] might have come fallen even though we
[1:31:26] might have sinned in Kavala short of the
[1:31:28] glory of God and even though we'd beat
[1:31:30] before we ever intended to do evil
[1:31:33] before we had ever formed our lips to
[1:31:35] speak alive we were condemned by her
[1:31:37] birth but that God would have a plan of
[1:31:39] redemption for us and she was driven to
[1:31:42] play the part of a harlot and we realize
[1:31:44] all we could cast her to the side and we
[1:31:47] could speak evil things of Eve but all
[1:31:49] in the same way that she was asked to
[1:31:51] play the part of the harlot you are cast
[1:31:54] in the role of a queen and you are cast
[1:31:57] in the role of such a queen that you
[1:31:59] would not be defiled but you would
[1:32:01] remain pure and I can't we cannot take
[1:32:04] credit and we cannot say oh I made a
[1:32:06] good decision I made a great decision
[1:32:08] but there's a Redemption that's pursuing
[1:32:10] you and there's a love that's covering
[1:32:12] you and there's a power that's catching
[1:32:14] you in that role of a virgin and you
[1:32:17] just have to be yielded to it praise be
[1:32:24] to God he says but because she was cast
[1:32:27] over in that side she has also been
[1:32:30] given a sacred charge from God for
[1:32:35] redemption even the woman I'm gonna let
[1:32:41] you play the part of a harlot because
[1:32:43] I'm gonna let my bride play the part of
[1:32:45] a wife I'm gonna let her play the part
[1:32:48] I'm gonna cast her as the faithful woman
[1:32:51] I'm gonna give her the role and I'm
[1:32:53] gonna give her the privilege of being
[1:32:55] the faithful woman who cannot fall who
[1:32:58] will not defile herself who will stay
[1:33:00] faithful and because the woman was
[1:33:02] allowed to play that part in the fall he
[1:33:05] has allowed his wife to be given a
[1:33:07] sacred charge for redemption
[1:33:10] that means the bride has a divine
[1:33:12] responsibility a sacred charge a divine
[1:33:15] responsibility God has a given you a
[1:33:18] duty a duty given by God for the purpose
[1:33:22] of glorifying God and satisfying his
[1:33:25] need and giving him purpose God has
[1:33:29] given her a sacred charge for redemption
[1:33:32] the woman has a special place in
[1:33:35] bringing the fullness of redemption now
[1:33:38] this is where this is where it gets a
[1:33:41] little bit of complet gets a little bit
[1:33:42] complicated because there's some that
[1:33:45] want to they want to glorify Christ to
[1:33:50] such a degree that they want to tear
[1:33:52] down the bride but Christ cannot bring
[1:33:58] the fullness of redemption without his
[1:34:00] wife because she's part of it so he's
[1:34:05] given her a sacred charge if the first
[1:34:08] Adam could not replenish without the
[1:34:10] woman neither can Christ bring this to
[1:34:14] its fulfillment in its completion
[1:34:15] without you through her will the
[1:34:23] completion of God the completion of what
[1:34:25] God foreshadowed in the garden we
[1:34:28] accomplished through her he'll do it
[1:34:30] through her will be the fulfillment of
[1:34:32] the original brother brems says in
[1:34:35] spoken words the original seed God came
[1:34:36] in flesh to give us another birth to
[1:34:40] bring us back to original sons and
[1:34:41] daughters of God there you are
[1:34:44] he says the life sperm of Eden never
[1:34:46] happened it never did she mingled it
[1:34:49] kept it away instead of Adam coming to
[1:34:52] her for a bride when the time appointed
[1:34:54] would be how do you have that image in
[1:34:56] your mind of Adam and the woman bringing
[1:34:59] forth children according to the original
[1:35:00] commandment that word was never
[1:35:02] fulfilled now with that image in mind he
[1:35:04] says just like Christ would have come to
[1:35:07] the group Christ would have come to his
[1:35:11] church he promised to do it God promised
[1:35:14] to multiply but they had to wait until
[1:35:17] God's time and if I could say this the
[1:35:21] time has arrived this is God's time to
[1:35:25] fulfill this this is God's time to
[1:35:28] complete it the time is now this is the
[1:35:30] specific time to complete what has not
[1:35:33] been completed
[1:35:34] the old testament prefigures Jesus
[1:35:36] Christ and a foreshadowed Christ and it
[1:35:39] culminates in the perfect expression of
[1:35:41] the bridegroom and the New Testament
[1:35:44] prefigures the Bride of Christ and it
[1:35:45] culminates in the perfect expression of
[1:35:48] the bride brother Ram says as Noah Moses
[1:35:51] David reflected the coming of this
[1:35:52] perfect bridegroom
[1:35:53] so as Luther Wesley and Pentecost
[1:35:55] reflected the coming of a perfect bride
[1:35:58] and here she is with the sacred charge
[1:36:01] full Redemption do you realize this is
[1:36:03] why we don't play Church do you know why
[1:36:06] you have so passionately desired a
[1:36:08] pastor not so that you could play church
[1:36:10] but because you realize it's part of
[1:36:12] God's dynamics and mechanics and
[1:36:14] dynamics of God's program to bring the
[1:36:16] bride to rapture in faith and to bring
[1:36:18] her to a place of the full expression of
[1:36:20] God that's why you have this passion not
[1:36:23] because we play Church if we wanted to
[1:36:25] play church go find anyone go anywhere
[1:36:29] sit under anything that's all you need
[1:36:32] is the trappings and you need all the
[1:36:34] the church order listen I think that's
[1:36:36] what's happened if co D has become OCD
[1:36:40] because we leave the word out of it and
[1:36:44] listen the whole purpose of this the
[1:36:47] mechanics and dynamics of this is there
[1:36:49] will be a bride that will bring forth
[1:36:51] the entire Word of God in its fullness
[1:36:53] and I'm not playing Church and I'm not
[1:36:56] simply happy with the resemblance of
[1:36:57] church I am the bride that isn't an
[1:37:00] intimate relationship with the word and
[1:37:01] I want to avail myself to God's program
[1:37:07] brother Branham says in Christ is the
[1:37:10] mystery of who God revealed the anointed
[1:37:11] man now the anointed people to bring
[1:37:14] back the anointed bride and bridegroom
[1:37:19] anointed by accepting what Eve turned
[1:37:22] down what did she turn down the
[1:37:26] privilege of reproducing the son she
[1:37:29] never did it the privilege of
[1:37:32] reproducing the son and Adam coming back
[1:37:35] with the anointing of the word because
[1:37:37] he said my word of spirit anointed with
[1:37:39] the word what Eve turned down he comes
[1:37:43] back and we accept
[1:37:48] who was those deals Christ he comes back
[1:37:55] and we accept see how that hybrid
[1:37:58] condition again just exactly what he'd
[1:38:00] done Eve he told he don't you do this
[1:38:01] and don't you do that and you can do
[1:38:03] this and you can do that and Satan said
[1:38:04] oh you know but she turned around and
[1:38:07] listened to him
[1:38:07] but the eve in the last days is not
[1:38:11] going to do it because she's
[1:38:13] predestinated not to do it i let's not
[1:38:17] take any credit why won't you fall why
[1:38:20] won't you walk away you guys have had a
[1:38:22] lot of time to think about this why
[1:38:24] haven't you quit you predestinated not -
[1:38:29] she's predestinated not to do it yes sir
[1:38:31] god's going to do it he knows he'll have
[1:38:33] it he said the church would be there
[1:38:36] without spot or wrinkle she's going to
[1:38:38] stand there in the splendor of him his
[1:38:41] word made manifest she will accept what
[1:38:45] Eve turned down what is he saying god of
[1:38:49] this evil age that God would call out of
[1:38:53] people out of this evil age for he says
[1:38:56] she has made manifest being tried been
[1:38:59] proven proved - Satan like it was at the
[1:39:01] beginning so shall it be at the end and
[1:39:05] he talks about Malachi 4 restores back
[1:39:08] the original faith so he says we find
[1:39:11] out this evil a just to prove to Satan
[1:39:14] can you finish the statement she is not
[1:39:18] like Eve this won't be left unfinished
[1:39:22] she is not that type of a woman she will
[1:39:27] be tried by his word the bride as Adams
[1:39:29] bride was tried by the word and Adams
[1:39:31] bride believed every bit of the word all
[1:39:33] confused but on one promise that he's
[1:39:35] the same yesterday today forever failed
[1:39:38] on one promise under temptation of the
[1:39:39] enemy face to face and now the people
[1:39:42] that's called for his name of course is
[1:39:44] his bride she has to come and contact
[1:39:47] again by the same thing face to face
[1:39:50] with Christ this so that she can
[1:39:53] withstand face to face with the enemy
[1:39:54] she's to come in contact again by the
[1:39:57] same thing not by denominational truth
[1:39:59] or something but
[1:40:00] by every word the bride fulfills in
[1:40:07] brown even says it this way in Chapter
[1:40:10] one of the church age book Adam Eve were
[1:40:11] in the garden and did not finish out the
[1:40:14] thousand years now Jesus our last Adam
[1:40:17] and his Eve the true church will fulfill
[1:40:20] all the plan of God not just a thousand
[1:40:25] years but through his bride the last
[1:40:29] Adam and the true church will fulfill
[1:40:31] all the plan of God but the brennaman
[1:40:38] choosing of a bride says the bride he's
[1:40:42] referring to the bride and about the
[1:40:44] bride he says this quoting is pregnant
[1:40:46] by the Word of God and will bring forth
[1:40:49] the finished body of Jesus Christ the
[1:40:54] bride is pregnant with the Word of God
[1:40:56] and being pregnant she will give birth
[1:40:59] to the finished body of Jesus Christ
[1:41:03] because he says the two together make
[1:41:06] the one body again like it was at the
[1:41:10] beginning like it was it was supposed to
[1:41:11] be at the beginning the musicians if you
[1:41:13] would come and you can just feel the
[1:41:16] adrenaline rush through the congregation
[1:41:18] and spoken words the original seed she's
[1:41:21] told to pick up the pin and write and
[1:41:23] then he writes it this way in the church
[1:41:24] age book here's what I'm trying to say
[1:41:26] to you the law of reproduction is that
[1:41:29] each species fourth of it after its own
[1:41:31] kind and even according to Genesis 111
[1:41:33] and God said let the earth bring forth
[1:41:35] grass and the herb yielding seed and the
[1:41:37] fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind
[1:41:39] whose seed is in itself upon the earth
[1:41:40] and it was so whatever life was in the
[1:41:42] seed came forth into a plant and thence
[1:41:45] into fruit the very same law applies to
[1:41:48] the church today so it's not just
[1:41:50] reproducing the plant it's reproducing
[1:41:52] the fruit whatever was in the seed
[1:41:55] whatever the seed started the church
[1:41:58] will come forth whatever life was in the
[1:42:00] seed come forth and the plant infants in
[1:42:02] the fruit the very same law law applies
[1:42:03] to the church today
[1:42:04] whatever seed started the church will
[1:42:06] come forth and be like the original seed
[1:42:09] because it's the same seed in these last
[1:42:12] days
[1:42:13] the true bride church Christ seen will
[1:42:17] come to the headstone and she will be a
[1:42:19] super Church a super race as she nears
[1:42:22] him then the bride will be so much like
[1:42:24] him they will be in his very image this
[1:42:27] is unorder to be united with him they
[1:42:30] will be one they will be the very
[1:42:32] manifestation of the word of the Living
[1:42:34] God
[1:42:35] denominations cannot produce this wrong
[1:42:37] seed they will produce their Creed's
[1:42:40] their dogmas mixed with the word this
[1:42:42] mongrel isin brings a hybrid bread
[1:42:45] product I know some of you think of
[1:42:46] brother Aaron you could have just read
[1:42:47] this quote in the beginning we could
[1:42:49] have called a prayer line because it
[1:42:51] says it just is saying it exactly the
[1:42:53] first son Adam was the spoken seed Word
[1:42:56] of God he was given a bride to reproduce
[1:42:58] himself that is why the bride was given
[1:43:01] to him to reproduce himself to produce
[1:43:02] another son of God but she fell fell by
[1:43:06] hybridization she caused him to die the
[1:43:09] son second son Jesus also a spoken seed
[1:43:12] Word of God was given a bride like as
[1:43:15] was Adam but before he could marry her
[1:43:17] she also had fallen look at the image
[1:43:20] that's being created look at how he's
[1:43:22] bringing this image before it's over no
[1:43:24] girl she like Adams wife was put to the
[1:43:26] test whether she would believe the Word
[1:43:28] of God and live or doubt the word and
[1:43:30] die she doubted she left the word she
[1:43:34] died but remember your to prove that
[1:43:39] you're not like Eve now you're not that
[1:43:41] type of a woman so he says from a little
[1:43:43] group of the true seed of the word of
[1:43:45] God God will present Christ with the
[1:43:48] beloved bride she is a virgin of his
[1:43:51] word she is a virgin because she knows
[1:43:53] no man-made Creed's or dogmas then catch
[1:43:56] the revelation of this statement by and
[1:43:59] through the members of the bride raise
[1:44:02] your hand if you're a member of that
[1:44:03] body by and through you individually
[1:44:06] will be fulfilled all that was promised
[1:44:11] of God to be made manifest in the Virgin
[1:44:15] hallelujah you are fulfilling the
[1:44:17] original by and through you will he
[1:44:21] satisfy his purpose and he will fulfill
[1:44:24] the purity the sanctity to holiness the
[1:44:28] righteousness the very purpose of the
[1:44:30] woman in the beginning that's why there
[1:44:32] had to be an invisible Union his pion
[1:44:38] through the members of the bride will be
[1:44:39] fulfilled all that was promised of God
[1:44:43] to be made manifest in the Virgin
[1:44:48] because you will fulfill all the plan of
[1:44:50] God can you say thank you Lord and you
[1:44:57] thank God that we had a prophet that
[1:44:59] came and diligently and faithfully with
[1:45:03] great intention I realized that
[1:45:07] sometimes we we like to think that maybe
[1:45:09] brother Branham was just innocently
[1:45:11] saying things and just accidentally
[1:45:13] saying this but he was a man that had
[1:45:18] been so broken and losing his wife and
[1:45:24] his daughter and losing so much and
[1:45:27] suffering so much to even come to a
[1:45:29] place in the very middle of his ministry
[1:45:30] and right back rush started again
[1:45:33] and God gives him this great vision and
[1:45:36] he realizes that there's the first pull
[1:45:39] a second pull and then the third pull
[1:45:40] but when it comes to that third pull you
[1:45:44] just say exactly what I tell you to say
[1:45:46] and so he knew I can't explain this too
[1:45:49] much III can't try to interpret this so
[1:45:54] he had to stay faithful to preach it and
[1:45:57] just say it exactly as he told him to
[1:45:59] say it and I believe he used great
[1:46:01] restraint but also great inspiration to
[1:46:04] try to preach the revelation of Jesus
[1:46:07] Christ so that we could recognize that
[1:46:10] what you have the privilege on this hour
[1:46:12] of receiving it's something that God has
[1:46:16] looked forward to from the very moment
[1:46:18] that he said that there be
[1:46:22] and if that is what God had in his mind
[1:46:25] when he said let there be then I say
[1:46:29] beard under me being under me o God if
[1:46:34] this is the great climax this is the
[1:46:36] great culmination then be it unto me
[1:46:39] according to thy word let's stand to our
[1:46:43] feet well thank you God
[1:46:46] oh thank you lord if you said let it be
[1:46:51] that be it unto me let that be your
[1:46:56] anchor tonight listen I know I am going
[1:47:02] to be turning it over to brother Aaron
[1:47:04] as as he he feels this unction of the
[1:47:08] Lord I listen brother Branham took great
[1:47:15] pains to express that the success of the
[1:47:18] first poll was because it was in the
[1:47:20] word the success of the second polls
[1:47:23] because it was in the word and the
[1:47:25] success of the third poll is because
[1:47:27] it's the full word perfect
[1:47:29] interpretation of the word with divine
[1:47:31] vindication so when you come when you
[1:47:34] meet the Lord on the basis of his word
[1:47:36] that's where you're placing your faith
[1:47:38] not in the hand of a man not in the
[1:47:41] mechanics of a line but you're
[1:47:43] recognizing that this is something that
[1:47:44] God will meet my faith in this moment
[1:47:47] and for this need and so we're not just
[1:47:50] we're not playing Church we're not just
[1:47:52] fantasizing about some kind of
[1:47:54] supernatural but I'm gonna let it be an
[1:47:56] act of faith not fanaticism not
[1:47:59] emotionalism not any kind of former
[1:48:02] pattern but I'm going to come and faith
[1:48:04] believing that I am his son buying his
[1:48:07] daughter and that he loves me and he's
[1:48:10] taking great care for me and listen if I
[1:48:12] could say it this way God is happy to
[1:48:15] prove his word God is happy to confirm
[1:48:18] the coming for his elect time and time
[1:48:21] and time again meet him on the basis of
[1:48:23] his word he will back up this word
[1:48:27] and this word that were facing the
[1:48:30] completion of today he will back it up
[1:48:34] tonight
[1:48:34] take him out his word don't come from a
[1:48:38] position of weakness but a position of
[1:48:40] confidence that this is what God
[1:48:42] promised us bow our heads I'll just say
[1:48:45] word of prayer just to finish my part
[1:48:47] could you say be it unto me according to
[1:48:50] thy word
[1:48:51] let it be Lord let it be let me tour
[1:48:57] take my place in the completion of this
[1:49:00] word a gracious Heavenly Father I pray
[1:49:04] Lord for these people have a very very
[1:49:11] deep love for brother Perry green
[1:49:13] [Music]
[1:49:15] very deep love for brother Matthew
[1:49:17] Watkins and tremendous friendship that I
[1:49:20] have with him and what I have a love for
[1:49:24] your people
[1:49:25] I desire Lord to draw them close to your
[1:49:30] bosom now or comfort their hearts and
[1:49:36] their despondency Lord in their
[1:49:39] disillusionment and their failed
[1:49:47] expectations Lord and they they not
[1:49:51] forget the love that you have for them
[1:49:55] and the great care that you're taking
[1:49:58] with their lives so they'll be able to
[1:50:01] stand one day with your word my faith
[1:50:08] and faith alone because it's gonna take
[1:50:12] a bride that's been tested and tried and
[1:50:14] proven she's not like Eve to be able to
[1:50:20] stare down that last enemy and say with
[1:50:24] an assurance death you cannot have me
[1:50:29] so I prayed tonight Lord you let our
[1:50:31] faith accumulate to believe all things
[1:50:35] are possible
[1:50:37] and I say now Lord bless your people
[1:50:40] pray that you would comfort them give
[1:50:44] them the desires of their heart and be
[1:50:46] with them and feed them on lead them to
[1:50:50] new things Lord and an unfolding word

[1:50:56] them in this desert may they fear no
[1:51:01] more Lord may you be their portion I

[1:55:28] from one spirit that's a spirit of Satan
[1:55:30] and every attribute that you need for
[1:55:32] healing comes from the Spirit of God
[1:55:34] it's all it's all included so it doesn't
[1:55:38] take any special faith or any special
[1:55:41] business taking part at his word

[1:56:07] not even be able to express it in words
[1:56:11] brother Branham would stand there now

[1:56:16] something he says you know what I'm
[1:56:18] waiting for it he'd just be talking and
[1:56:21] then he would say here he is let me tell
[1:56:24] you something here he is because he said
[1:56:28] he would be so if you can come under the
[1:56:31] same faith you can have what you guys
[1:56:34] without faith something that brother

[2:45:46] I want to say I appreciate brother Aaron
[2:45:50] taking the time to minister to you it's
[2:45:54] different when you have a visiting
[2:45:57] Minister like this who doesn't know it
[2:46:02] may not be influenced by knowing you
[2:46:06] sometimes as a friend or a person close
[2:46:10] to you it's hard to look surpass certain
[2:46:12] things but I know when a brother's
[2:46:16] Minister he speaks and all sudden he'll
[2:46:17] begin to speak and pray over something
[2:46:19] that goes directly to your heart and you
[2:46:22] know that wasn't anybody but God so

[2:46:52] or explain what what we have need of
[2:46:54] Lord but you know best
[2:46:57] and we want to say thank you Lord we
[2:46:59] want to say we love you Lord and
[2:47:01] tomorrow Lord as it comes in the morning
[2:47:04] and the day goes through Lord and maybe
[2:47:06] we trip and fall and maybe we fail let
[2:47:09] us be reminded that you are mindful of
[2:47:11] us and you care for us let us stand up
