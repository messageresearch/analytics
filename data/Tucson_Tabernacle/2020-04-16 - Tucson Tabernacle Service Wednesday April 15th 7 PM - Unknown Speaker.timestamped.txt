[42:49] bless
[42:51] [Applause]
[42:56] [Music]
[43:10] [Music]
[43:20] a merely yield to him completely
[43:29] thank you musicians god bless you
[43:33] thought that was the right song to to
[43:36] Kim to come out with gesture
[43:38] kind of along the thought of this this
[43:42] evening but to yield and surrender and
[43:46] and say Lord whatever you would and and
[43:50] not to fight against it but to yield
[43:53] answer surrender against insu heard the
[43:56] testimony him brother Jeremy and sister
[44:00] Angela healthy the lost wallet in a
[44:03] couple of days ago myself and Rachel and
[44:06] Naomi went to the park we were tossing
[44:09] some frisbees around out there and Naomi
[44:13] said down her backpack there her debit
[44:18] card fell out or somehow fell out didn't
[44:21] know till we got home and she was
[44:22] checking and there were other folks
[44:24] around that area so her and Rachel went
[44:26] back and walked right across and as they
[44:28] were walking straight across to where we
[44:29] had sat down there in the field was a
[44:31] debit card Lane they're so grateful for
[44:35] the help that God takes care of every
[44:37] one of our needs and and he knows how
[44:39] how to do that and then our son-in-law
[44:44] Steven back in Wichita they had they had
[44:49] gave them some time off paid and things
[44:53] and then they got a note or they were
[44:56] heard this morning that they had been
[44:57] furloughed and so later on that morning
[45:02] Steven got a call from his boss and said
[45:04] this affects everybody but you
[45:06] he says we want to keep you we want you
[45:09] two to stay on with us so God keeps to
[45:13] takes care of us and I appreciate that
[45:15] so he's been good to us and he's made
[45:19] our every need and never fails so that's
[45:23] let's go to the first scripture there
[45:26] brother Jeremy maybe seem a little
[45:33] a little different a little odd and how
[45:35] to start this but asking the Lord to
[45:38] allow me to deliver the thought that's
[45:40] in my heart it's proverbs chapter 16
[45:44] verse 25 and it said there's a way that
[45:49] seemeth right unto a man but the end
[45:52] thereof are the ways of death so it's
[45:56] well maybe as we go along you'll see how
[45:59] that fits well let's just bow our heads
[46:01] Lord we we've come this evening and
[46:04] we've gathered here Lord those of us
[46:07] that that can be gathered and wherever
[46:09] your children are Lord and it would be
[46:11] and would be wonderful to have everybody
[46:14] here if we could but you know the
[46:16] reasons why and Lord let us take been
[46:19] the the get a benefit from it Lord in
[46:22] this time and wherever your children are
[46:25] today Lord and maybe some are working
[46:27] somewhere driving some at home wherever
[46:29] they might be Lord it they would set
[46:31] this time and and let you minister to
[46:33] them speak to them Lord I'm sure there's
[46:36] questions and and concerns Lord but
[46:39] you're you're mindful of us Lord so we
[46:41] ask you to minister to each one wherever
[46:43] they might be Lord and lord let us speak
[46:46] words Lord that that you would put in
[46:48] our mouth or not our thoughts Lord but
[46:50] what you would have because you know
[46:52] what we have need of Lord because our
[46:54] ways will get us in trouble Lord but
[46:57] through us salvation in your ways Lord
[46:59] we ask it in Jesus Christ's name Amen so
[47:03] there's a way that seemeth right unto a
[47:05] man but the end thereof are the ways of
[47:09] death way back in the beginning a
[47:13] recorded history if I could say was
[47:15] written down in the Bible when man
[47:19] started his own way he introduced death
[47:23] and they thought everything was okay
[47:26] everything was right and everything
[47:28] would be fine but now we see the the
[47:31] prolonged process of that to where man
[47:36] has gone today but God is still in
[47:39] charge God is still in control and
[47:43] sometimes as brother Matt ministered
[47:45] Sunday morning and
[47:47] it may seem to you that I'm copying him
[47:52] today but that's not how it happened
[47:55] when Sunday morning I was talking to my
[47:58] wife reading some scriptures and I began
[48:00] to say look at this look at this having
[48:02] no idea what brother Matt would be
[48:04] ministering but it tied right into into
[48:08] that so see how the Lord will lead us to
[48:11] do that but God has never failed us he's
[48:16] never left us and never will God keeps
[48:19] his word brother Branham taught us he's
[48:21] only as good as his word and we are only
[48:24] as good as our word because you know
[48:26] when you fail somebody or somebody fails
[48:28] you once it's hard to build that
[48:30] confidence back up you know it's it's it
[48:33] seems like when when you get hurt or you
[48:35] fail somebody or somebody fails you it
[48:37] it takes some time to reestablish but
[48:40] God has never failed and you know we
[48:43] appreciate that soon I'd like to read
[48:46] something through the daily strength
[48:49] that came in I believe this was maybe
[48:55] Monday night or Tuesday and I'd like to
[48:59] read this to you it just fit right in
[49:02] with the thought here says did you know
[49:04] that your body has to have protein and
[49:06] that proteins contain nitrogen but in
[49:11] order for our body to get this nitrogen
[49:13] from the proteins it it has to come from
[49:16] the plants and animals that we eat we
[49:19] can't get nitrogen in our lungs through
[49:21] the air we breathe our body chemistry
[49:23] can't just absorb nitrogen molecules as
[49:27] this so molecules in the air has to be
[49:30] broken down the nitrogen in the air
[49:33] consists of two atoms which are bonded
[49:35] very tightly in order for us to absorb
[49:38] this nitrogen the two atoms have to be
[49:41] separated a little science lesson that
[49:44] here but this is the part the way these
[49:48] molecules are broken down is during a
[49:50] thunderstorm when a storm is raging
[49:52] there's enough electrical energy in the
[49:55] clouds and lightning that they separate
[49:57] the nitrogen atoms in the air the storm
[50:00] then brings a broken
[50:01] molecules down to the ground in the form
[50:03] of rain so the nitrates that the soil
[50:05] needs a type of fertilizer gets a
[50:08] nitrogen by the storms obvious lend this
[50:10] obviously then the cycle takes place the
[50:14] nitrogen now is in the soil in the soil
[50:16] is absorbed by the plants growing up
[50:18] then when we eat the plants our bodies
[50:20] get the nitrogen so without the storms
[50:23] we wouldn't have nitrates without the
[50:25] storms of life you won't spiritually
[50:28] grow properly God allows even the storms
[50:31] to benefit us and grow us and strengthen
[50:34] us in the myths of the storm he teaches
[50:37] us just how much of a shelter he is for
[50:40] us when the storms are raging take peace
[50:43] in the fact that God is doing something
[50:45] marvelous although you may not see it
[50:49] he is piece from your storm and I
[50:53] thought I was appreciated that because
[50:55] he knew the thoughts in my heart and
[50:57] thing and I read that and that was I
[50:59] believe it was Monday evening and I said
[51:02] thank you Lord that you would confirm
[51:03] that so a couple of quotes here the
[51:08] first one from the message of greater
[51:10] than Solomon is here preached in 62 and
[51:13] just just to establish this and it's not
[51:16] that we don't know these things but
[51:18] sometimes just to read them and remind
[51:20] ourselves this now we've got to have the
[51:23] faith that Abram had in the Word of God
[51:24] that's right that's that's what brings
[51:28] the things to pass is faith in what he
[51:30] said you'll never move it no other way
[51:33] but have faith in what God said you must
[51:36] take his word above everything else let
[51:38] every man's word be a lie in God's be
[51:41] true what God said just believe it if
[51:44] you can't believe it that way you'll
[51:46] never get nowhere with God you might be
[51:49] able to join a church somewhere but I
[51:51] mean get somewhere with God see that's a
[51:54] whole lot different you know there's a
[51:57] lot of people in right now with all the
[51:59] streaming that's going on and you open
[52:02] up your maybe Facebook or YouTube and
[52:04] you see every church is if having to
[52:06] operate this way and not being critical
[52:09] or anything of they're doing what they
[52:11] have what they know and everybody's
[52:14] doing that and
[52:15] and it's you know you look at some of it
[52:17] and and you would say my goodness you
[52:19] know I and that wouldn't satisfy me you
[52:24] know I need I need more than that or my
[52:27] my my desire is more of God than that
[52:29] you know and but to whatever God allows
[52:33] them to do I'm not being critical of
[52:35] that but I just know my desire is more
[52:38] of you Lord more of you know not not
[52:40] just a little bit I'll take that a
[52:42] little bit but I want more of you and
[52:44] then I thought that with I surrender all
[52:46] I surrender my will I surrender my ideas
[52:50] especially when my ideas put me in a
[52:54] place that it might be contrary to what
[52:56] God is doing not that I want to be
[52:59] contrary not that I want to go against
[53:02] his will in any way but looking out on
[53:05] my way sometimes it's actually not the
[53:07] right way or the best way and that's
[53:10] what what Solomon said in Proverbs is
[53:12] that a man if he thinks he's doing right
[53:13] and he's actually leading himself to
[53:16] death and so he's you know he tells it
[53:19] and then he tells us in proverbs 16
[53:23] we'll read some verses here 1 2 3 and
[53:26] the 9 and 17 we could read the whole
[53:29] chapter but just as the preparations of
[53:32] the heart in man it the preparations in
[53:35] the heart we make we make plans we do
[53:37] this he said but the answer of the
[53:39] tongue is from the Lord he will allow if
[53:41] we let him he'll speak what is right
[53:43] there's times that we've had we've
[53:46] pulled this way where we're filling this
[53:48] way
[53:48] and I say Lord you help me in this
[53:50] situation you you you direct me in this
[53:52] situation if I can yield to it then the
[53:55] right answer comes out and and that's
[53:57] how we want all the ways of man are
[53:59] clean in his own eyes and and and I you
[54:02] know I can honestly say and I would say
[54:05] of all of us we don't have an intention
[54:07] to do wrong we don't have an intention
[54:09] to fail we don't want to be wrong but we
[54:10] can be there's only one perfect one and
[54:13] that's God but the Lord with the spirits
[54:16] he looks to see what is the mode of what
[54:18] is the driving force behind that what's
[54:20] causing us to act the way we're doing
[54:22] and then he says commit thy works unto
[54:25] the Lord and I thoughts shall be
[54:27] established
[54:28] as we kneel down we pray Lord I know
[54:30] that my heart's desires but I'm yielding
[54:33] to you I'm surrendering to you I'm
[54:34] saying Lord what is it that you want and
[54:37] let him set then then we'll go to verses
[54:40] 9 and 17 a man's heart devises his way
[54:44] but the Lord directs his steps and I'm
[54:48] grateful to her that very much so
[54:50] because who knows where I might have
[54:52] been had I had I followed all the
[54:54] devices of my heart the highway of the
[54:57] upright is to depart from evil and he
[55:01] that keepeth his away preserver save his
[55:03] soul so brother Matt had talked about
[55:05] that beaten path and it's it wouldn't
[55:10] when he was talking there he says you
[55:11] know you go he said it you've been there
[55:13] so many times you've gone that way so
[55:14] many times there's actually away a
[55:17] marked way and when he was saying that
[55:19] it made me think being out on the open
[55:21] the mountains hunting or especially here
[55:24] in Arizona where there's not so much
[55:26] thick brush and trees that you can
[55:27] actually see and you can see the game
[55:30] trails there well used trails through
[55:33] the hills that the game use and it's
[55:36] it's a marked way and if you sit on the
[55:39] side of the hill and you'll spend some
[55:40] time you watch them moving they find the
[55:43] easiest way to go now if you startle a
[55:45] deer maybe he might go straight up the
[55:47] side of the mountain but if he has his
[55:49] choice he's going to use a game trail
[55:50] and and I found we financed brother Matt
[55:53] was saying because you've been there
[55:54] because you've gone down that way if you
[55:56] you've sought the Lord that way you can
[55:59] go back there and say I sought the Lord
[56:01] I'm going back to that spot where he met
[56:03] me and so this is just a culmination of
[56:06] those of those thoughts today and and
[56:09] then will will read from the evening
[56:13] messenger will read some more quotes
[56:15] here so sometimes these things happen
[56:23] for good you know the Bible said they
[56:25] were together for good now remembered
[56:27] job all of his trials now that wasn't
[56:31] God chastening job but a chaste
[56:34] I'm sorry chastening job that's pretty
[56:37] close to job but it was God
[56:40] approving his servant
[56:42] now you and I might look at it and say
[56:44] boy I I'm I'm getting chastised I'm
[56:48] really in trouble but God is doing
[56:50] something with that he wants it wants to
[56:53] to show something out of that so it all
[56:56] worked for good you see and then the
[56:58] book of Job was wrote for all
[57:00] generations for a testimony so if it was
[57:03] written of Job that way then it's
[57:05] written of me and you that way for a
[57:06] testimony now God's working is for good
[57:11] so that's an established thought God's
[57:13] working is for good the supernatural we
[57:19] realize that this is like experiences of
[57:23] a Christian sometimes we have to go
[57:25] through terrible chastisement chastising
[57:28] of the Lord many things to correct us
[57:30] that will be fruit bearing Christians
[57:33] sometimes has to prune us cut off take
[57:36] away take out of our hands
[57:39] we think sometimes oh god what are you
[57:41] doing to us but he knows what he's doing
[57:43] so we pray father that today that you'll
[57:45] prune every one of us from the least to
[57:48] the greatest the pastor God we pray that
[57:51] you'll prune every one of us take away
[57:54] all that's unlike you Father
[57:56] take away the thing that's hindering us
[57:59] from being fruit bearing Christians the
[58:01] day is coming when it go when it's going
[58:03] to get dark and we want to go into the
[58:06] sheepfold we want to be sheep today
[58:08] father we want to follow exactly in the
[58:10] footsteps of the shepherd he gave us as
[58:13] an example I come not to do my will but
[58:16] the will of him that sent me
[58:17] may that be our motive today God to do
[58:20] the will of God who saved us and again
[58:24] sometimes we have to check ourselves
[58:26] closely is it something I want and you
[58:30] know is it is it really I'm saying Lord
[58:32] I want this because I want it or are we
[58:36] saying Lord well you know I surrender
[58:38] all whatever you desire from three kinds
[58:41] of believers job went through the trials
[58:46] and the tests his children taken
[58:48] everything else taken the church members
[58:51] come accused him of being a secret
[58:53] sinner and tried to say everything
[58:55] against
[58:55] but yet he wouldn't listen to any of it
[58:58] he knowed he had met God's requirement
[59:01] and that's the key he had met God's
[59:03] requirement that's all you and I can do
[59:06] is to meet God's requirement but you
[59:10] know the Bible teaches us the things
[59:12] that God asks us to do and we do them
[59:14] that's what he asked us to do he says he
[59:21] know that there's no need of Satan
[59:23] trying to tempt him he know that it was
[59:25] a devil as long as Satan can make him
[59:27] believe that his sickness was his God
[59:29] doing it he had Joe whipped but once
[59:33] what when Joe but once struck the
[59:35] revelation that it was not God
[59:37] he was only going through his trials to
[59:39] make him something it wasn't God doing
[59:41] it it was Satan doing it and remember
[59:43] Satan had to get permission to do it and
[59:46] same thing today he'll try to tell you
[59:48] that these trials is things your God
[59:51] trying to his things has got your God
[59:53] trying to put punishment on you it isn't
[59:56] so no sir it's Satan doing that and God
[59:59] permitting it to temper you to make you
[1:00:02] to see if you're tied to this earth by
[1:00:06] the earth cares or whether your treasure
[1:00:08] is in heaven for wherever your treasure
[1:00:10] is there you you also and and again
[1:00:14] sometimes we're looking at and saying
[1:00:16] Lord what are you doing to me
[1:00:18] why but God is in there and he's again
[1:00:21] he's going to show that his children are
[1:00:24] gonna be overcomers they're gonna
[1:00:26] they're going to be exactly what he said
[1:00:28] and this one I didn't give to brother
[1:00:30] Jeremy and I told him about it I said
[1:00:32] because I got it this afternoon and so
[1:00:35] I'll read this one here and I just it
[1:00:41] just fit so perfectly and can anything
[1:00:44] happen to a Christian without it for the
[1:00:46] best and he says no no no
[1:00:49] so what God so what did God get him out
[1:00:52] there alone on the island for and he's
[1:00:54] speaking of John when he's taken to the
[1:00:56] island of Patmos
[1:00:57] he says gives us the book of Revelation
[1:01:00] see God just can pull the wool over the
[1:01:03] devil's eyes anytime he wants to can't
[1:01:05] he he simply can't I just love him
[1:01:08] because
[1:01:09] I don't have to be smart see now if I
[1:01:12] was smart I try to forget all about it
[1:01:14] because I know no one could care be so
[1:01:18] smart like him and so he's telling me he
[1:01:21] pulls the wool over Satan he allows
[1:01:23] Satan to do these things and Satan told
[1:01:27] we know when he approached Jehovah their
[1:01:31] God he's there and he's saying have you
[1:01:32] considered my servant job and saying
[1:01:35] goes yeah but I'll get him to turn
[1:01:37] against you and God says go ahead
[1:01:39] I think Satan might have been a little
[1:01:41] wow that was easy
[1:01:44] he didn't even fight me for it yeah I
[1:01:46] didn't have to battle but he didn't know
[1:01:49] he's a tool in God's hands and and I we
[1:01:51] know that you know well sometimes we
[1:01:55] forget it sometimes we struggle through
[1:01:57] it so let's look a little bit at that
[1:01:59] there you know and then just just one
[1:02:04] more scripture here before we get into
[1:02:06] jobs I'm here in the book of James
[1:02:09] chapter 1 and 12 verse 12 blessed is a
[1:02:14] man okay
[1:02:15] blessed is the man or blessed that
[1:02:19] endureth temptation what a way - what a
[1:02:24] way to get a blessing huh you know hey
[1:02:28] you're gonna get a blessing today
[1:02:29] brother Jordan you're just going to be
[1:02:31] blessed you're gonna be tried from the
[1:02:32] moment you get up to the midnight moment
[1:02:34] you go to bed and brother jobs brother
[1:02:37] Jordan's gonna say I don't know if I'm
[1:02:38] will get out of bed then but here James
[1:02:41] house blesses a man that endureth
[1:02:42] temptation for when he has tried he
[1:02:45] shall receive the crown of life which
[1:02:47] the Lord have promised to them that love
[1:02:49] him and I read this and I looked at at
[1:02:53] what one of the other messengers how
[1:03:00] they approach is it happy is a man that
[1:03:02] endureth temptation trials of various
[1:03:05] kinds he shall receive a crown that
[1:03:07] fadeth not away which the Lord has
[1:03:10] promised to them that love him and his
[1:03:13] enduring proves his love for it is love
[1:03:17] only than endureth all things as
[1:03:19] scripture tells us that love
[1:03:22] all things so it tells you when you
[1:03:24] endure that you have the love of God in
[1:03:26] you so again it's it's a blessing even
[1:03:30] though at times we're questioning as to
[1:03:32] why but God has a purpose in all of this
[1:03:35] in in he's going to bring to pass
[1:03:40] everything that he has seen on it
[1:03:42] everything that he has said there will
[1:03:45] be a bride without spot without wrinkle
[1:03:47] without blemish there will be like he
[1:03:51] said I'd Eve that would not fall the
[1:03:54] second Eve Satan has done everything he
[1:03:57] can to try to stop that but God said
[1:03:59] there will be those that overcome selves
[1:04:02] we look in it in a little bit here with
[1:04:05] job and it was it was a scripture that I
[1:04:08] opened up with in the morning so let's
[1:04:12] go to job 22 we'll read verses 1 through
[1:04:15] 5 to start and then 21 and 22 just to
[1:04:19] save a little bit of time and we know we
[1:04:23] read enough and heard enough of job that
[1:04:25] his three friends come as three brothers
[1:04:27] however you want to later I'm sure they
[1:04:30] came with every intention to help job I
[1:04:32] don't think the three of them got
[1:04:34] together and said you know this is our
[1:04:36] opportunity to finally get even with Joe
[1:04:39] week and terram you know I think they
[1:04:41] they felt in their heart that they were
[1:04:43] coming to help job you know but they
[1:04:46] were gonna have to show him where he was
[1:04:48] wrong
[1:04:48] you know I said then Elif as the ten of
[1:04:53] my Tim up temanite answered and said and
[1:04:57] it just says here in it and it says that
[1:05:01] Elif as in in the notes that he was the
[1:05:04] son of esau or i descended of esau he
[1:05:07] says and it was given to him and this
[1:05:09] argument to try to prove to job where
[1:05:12] job he was trying to prove it look there
[1:05:17] has to be sin in your life it fell upon
[1:05:21] or his portion of the argument was that
[1:05:23] part and the so he says can a man be
[1:05:26] profitable unto God as he that his wise
[1:05:29] may be profitable unto himself he could
[1:05:33] are you at a place job where God would
[1:05:35] profit
[1:05:36] from you in the sense could you could
[1:05:38] you could he say well you know what
[1:05:39] you're right job I hadn't thought of
[1:05:41] that
[1:05:41] you're right I'll have to take that into
[1:05:43] consideration he said is there any
[1:05:45] pleasure to the Almighty that thou art
[1:05:47] righteous or is it gain to him that thou
[1:05:51] make us thy ways perfect no he's telling
[1:05:53] Joe business you are nothing to God
[1:05:56] you're not helping him you're not
[1:05:58] building him he's not looking to you
[1:06:00] this is Aleph s speaking to job will he
[1:06:06] reprove thee for fear of thee will he
[1:06:08] enter into thee with into judgment job
[1:06:10] did he is he gonna sit down I said man I
[1:06:12] need to come down and talk to job
[1:06:14] because if I don't get his opinion I may
[1:06:16] not get this right he says or if I don't
[1:06:20] do it I he may have it right in and I'll
[1:06:23] be wrong this is what L offense is
[1:06:25] speaking to job it's not thy wickedness
[1:06:27] great and thine iniquities infinite and
[1:06:30] if he finally comes down to come on job
[1:06:32] you've messed up you failed you've done
[1:06:35] wrong you've sinned you there's no other
[1:06:37] reason for this happening in your life
[1:06:40] but yes
[1:06:42] so as you know and he lays out quite a
[1:06:45] bit but let's jump to over to 21 and 22
[1:06:50] and this was the scripture that caught
[1:06:54] my attention a quaint now myself with
[1:06:57] him and I looked up the word acquaint
[1:07:02] and it says to cause to know personally
[1:07:08] to make familiar to cause to know
[1:07:11] firsthand not by over somebody else's
[1:07:15] opinion not by all somebody else's
[1:07:17] suggestion
[1:07:18] and it's good to hear what others have
[1:07:20] how they have met the Lord it's good to
[1:07:22] hear a testimony but you have to have
[1:07:24] your own testimony you have to acquaint
[1:07:27] yourself with him personally because you
[1:07:30] cannot live on somebody else's a
[1:07:32] revelation experience you have to meet
[1:07:35] God for yourself you know I I can't eat
[1:07:38] for you and you can't eat for me I've
[1:07:39] got to eat for myself if I want to live
[1:07:42] you know it doesn't work that way
[1:07:45] so he says a quaint ice now thyself with
[1:07:48] him and be at peace thereby good shall
[1:07:52] come unto thee receive I pray thee the
[1:07:55] law from his mouth and lay up his words
[1:07:57] in thine heart and there is nothing
[1:07:59] wrong with that that's that is a good
[1:08:02] suggestion acquaint yourself make him
[1:08:04] become a personal acquaintance of
[1:08:06] somebody who spend time with and again
[1:08:07] this was as brother man was speaking and
[1:08:10] this was in my heart and he talked about
[1:08:11] that pathway you know him so well you've
[1:08:14] acquainted himself you know his ways you
[1:08:17] know what pleases him because you've
[1:08:19] been there so many times there's a path
[1:08:23] trod there's there's a way there's not a
[1:08:25] not a going and searching and trying to
[1:08:26] find but I know that if I'll go like
[1:08:29] brother Branham used to go to the cave
[1:08:31] when he would go to the cave because he
[1:08:33] needed to hear from God and it was a
[1:08:34] place set aside he had made that
[1:08:37] acquaintance with him he had met with
[1:08:39] him it had become personal to him and he
[1:08:41] could go to that place he says and then
[1:08:43] he says receive I pray thee the law from
[1:08:46] his mouth and lay up his words from
[1:08:48] thine heart now we know the spirit that
[1:08:50] Aleph as was aimed at him in accusation
[1:08:52] but I can look at that in the right
[1:08:54] spirit said yes Lord I want to be a
[1:08:57] personal friend I want a relationship
[1:08:59] with you that's personal and I want to
[1:09:02] receive the law from thy mouth and lay
[1:09:04] up your words in my heart so that part
[1:09:07] was good with just what spirit wasn't
[1:09:09] given in so we go to the next chapter in
[1:09:13] Jobe answers and Jobe answered and said
[1:09:18] even today is my complaint bitter my
[1:09:22] stroke is heavier than my groaning he
[1:09:25] says I'm a bitter I'm hurting I'm
[1:09:27] wandering I'm under striding to figure
[1:09:29] this out
[1:09:29] and he says my complaint is bitter the
[1:09:33] stroke that I've received is even
[1:09:35] heavier than my groaning if you think my
[1:09:37] groaning is hard to hear the stroke that
[1:09:40] I've borne is even harder to bear
[1:09:43] sometimes you see somebody walking and
[1:09:45] they may have a smile they may look
[1:09:48] happy but they've received a stroke if
[1:09:50] you could say they've received something
[1:09:52] and this can be hard to bear and and
[1:09:55] we're all different in how we express
[1:09:58] how we show
[1:09:59] how we manifest some people you can
[1:10:01] almost read them their face their
[1:10:03] expression everything you know you know
[1:10:05] when they're not having a good day that
[1:10:07] pretty well everything about them tells
[1:10:08] you and there's others that you wouldn't
[1:10:10] know because but everybody's different
[1:10:14] we were talking about the other day and
[1:10:16] then I said to my wife or my wife said
[1:10:18] to me is just she said it's like you
[1:10:20] when you're when you're really serious
[1:10:22] everybody's wondering what's wrong with
[1:10:24] you they kind of look at you because my
[1:10:26] face get serious and everybody's like
[1:10:27] are you ok is everything and I and I
[1:10:30] said cuz most of the time I'm not it's
[1:10:32] not how I show myself but they think
[1:10:34] something is wrong and and then
[1:10:36] sometimes she would tell me be serious
[1:10:38] and I say yeah but when I'm serious you
[1:10:40] think something's wrong with me you know
[1:10:43] I said but but that's the way everybody
[1:10:44] expresses themselves differently you
[1:10:47] know so he says and then he says oh that
[1:10:50] I knew where I might find him that I
[1:10:54] might come even to his seat I would say
[1:10:59] the same thing oh that I could find him
[1:11:02] I would know how to get there and again
[1:11:04] there's that pathway where he is brother
[1:11:08] branham said it this way go to where you
[1:11:10] left him he'll still be there if there's
[1:11:13] that place that God meets you you know
[1:11:17] getting to a point as we saw on brother
[1:11:19] branham's life going through the
[1:11:20] troubles and the trials and the
[1:11:22] heartaches not because because he
[1:11:24] surprised God and God headed God knew
[1:11:26] exactly where he was gonna be but had to
[1:11:28] put him through those things to get to
[1:11:30] that point to hear speak to that storm
[1:11:34] speak it away so it doesn't break this
[1:11:37] fellowship that I'm having with you I'd
[1:11:39] love to be to that place when God would
[1:11:42] say just speak those circumstance those
[1:11:44] situations out so you and I could
[1:11:46] continue to have this fellowship we're
[1:11:48] having you know sometimes and something
[1:11:51] comes up and you know you have the
[1:11:52] intentions to pray to read your Bible
[1:11:54] and something comes up a situation comes
[1:11:56] up and you have to go deal with it
[1:11:58] someone that was someone is sick someone
[1:12:00] gets hurt you have to and you got to do
[1:12:02] it and you know and those things do
[1:12:04] happen but I would want God to say just
[1:12:07] speak to it it'll resolve itself because
[1:12:11] I want to have fellowship
[1:12:12] and this is job saying that I was old
[1:12:15] that I could go to that place that I
[1:12:20] might find him that I might come to a
[1:12:22] seat I would order my cause before him
[1:12:25] and fill my mouth with arguments you
[1:12:29] know Lord I don't deserve this
[1:12:32] really I've done everything you've said
[1:12:36] I'll Drive it I don't deserve this again
[1:12:39] we can read the book of Job and know why
[1:12:41] but job was going through it living it
[1:12:44] and he's able to write the book after
[1:12:47] until Hawaii is this I would order my
[1:12:51] cause before him fill my mouth with
[1:12:53] arguments let's go on I would know the
[1:12:57] words which he would answer me and
[1:12:59] understand what he would say unto me if
[1:13:03] I could get to him he could explain to
[1:13:05] me why this is happening what did I do
[1:13:09] Lord to deserve such treatment will he
[1:13:14] plead against me with his great power no
[1:13:16] but he would put strength in me and
[1:13:20] sometimes we get before God and we say
[1:13:24] we surrender we yield and we say Lord I
[1:13:27] need you I'm down to nothing and I need
[1:13:31] you but in your meeting with me will
[1:13:35] give me the strength that I need there
[1:13:38] the righteous might dispute with him
[1:13:40] so should I deliver forever be delivered
[1:13:44] forever from my judge job stood on the
[1:13:49] fact that he had laid a sacrifice down
[1:13:52] every morning that's all that job had
[1:13:57] the first book written in the Bible the
[1:14:01] oldest book they say job knew that he
[1:14:04] laid a sacrifice he had taken the life
[1:14:06] of an innocent animal and sacrificed it
[1:14:09] in his stead to meet the requirement of
[1:14:12] God and he says so he says I've done
[1:14:16] that I the righteous I can only stand on
[1:14:19] that that's all I can stand but if you
[1:14:24] can stand on that
[1:14:25] and go to God and said I've met your
[1:14:27] requirements I've come under the shed
[1:14:30] blood of the Lamb and you're permitted
[1:14:32] an entrance with him talk with him
[1:14:35] let's go on behold I'd go forward I go
[1:14:39] forward but he's out there and backwards
[1:14:41] and I cannot perceive him now here's
[1:14:43] Jobe saying I'm trying them doing this
[1:14:45] and I can't find him seems like he
[1:14:47] doesn't answer he seems like he's not
[1:14:49] there brother branham said the ceiling
[1:14:52] was brass while he was praying it just
[1:14:54] seemed like the prayers would rebound
[1:14:56] off him and come back down on the left
[1:14:58] hand where does he work but I cannot
[1:15:00] behold him he hided himself on the right
[1:15:03] hand that I cannot see him but then this
[1:15:07] is what Jobe speaks but he knoweth the
[1:15:11] way that I take when he hath tried me I
[1:15:14] shall come forth as gold and that's
[1:15:20] where you and I have to come to that
[1:15:22] same place Lord though you slay me yet
[1:15:26] I'll trust you though you try me though
[1:15:29] I go through these hard times I know
[1:15:31] that for a reason you're doing it there
[1:15:36] there's a purpose in it and that purpose
[1:15:38] is to be gold before you to bear the
[1:15:40] fruit as brother Bram said a fruit
[1:15:42] bearing tree that's the purpose for the
[1:15:45] pruning the-the-the-the what we would
[1:15:50] say sometimes I'll that hurts man why
[1:15:52] did you do that but there's a reason for
[1:15:55] it I shall come forth as gold and I've
[1:15:57] said this because you are gold the
[1:16:02] testing and the trials don't make you
[1:16:04] into gold but rather God knows his
[1:16:09] children and what's in them and
[1:16:10] therefore he's bringing it out of them
[1:16:13] he is showing what you are and who you
[1:16:16] are he says I shall come forth as gold
[1:16:18] pure refined tried into fire
[1:16:23] now you and I again get to read the
[1:16:27] story and get to know but job didn't job
[1:16:31] again is wandering and his accusers are
[1:16:33] really helping them feel that way about
[1:16:36] it you've sinned you've done
[1:16:39] you've grieved God if something you did
[1:16:42] Jove you need to confess it to us you
[1:16:45] need to tell us what you're done what
[1:16:47] have you done Joe go back recount all
[1:16:49] your steps go back in your life look
[1:16:51] where did I make a mistake where did I
[1:16:53] fail because that's why God is trying
[1:16:54] you
[1:16:55] that's human reasoning that's a human
[1:16:58] logic now there's no question about it
[1:17:00] we should just take a look at our steps
[1:17:04] sometimes look and see what is there
[1:17:06] something I need to clear up is there
[1:17:08] something I need to take care of if
[1:17:09] there's something that's troubling you
[1:17:11] is it something that you need to resolve
[1:17:15] but but if you're not careful you'll
[1:17:19] live your life in that God doesn't love
[1:17:22] me God doesn't I've made a mess God oh
[1:17:24] no no you've made it right you put it
[1:17:27] under the blood then move on go with God
[1:17:30] but this is a job says I go forward he
[1:17:33] said but I know that when he is when
[1:17:35] this is all said and done I shall come
[1:17:38] forth as gold I will be exactly what he
[1:17:41] has tried me too made me to be some
[1:17:44] maybe I could say it this way some get
[1:17:46] there faster and some get there slower
[1:17:48] some of us take a little bit more
[1:17:50] shaping beating banging tough to come
[1:17:52] out the way maybe some it just are able
[1:17:55] to yield better learn faster I don't
[1:17:57] know but God knows that and then in
[1:18:03] Hebrews chapter 12 and we'll read verses
[1:18:06] 5 through 11 we know the end of the
[1:18:10] story of job you know in order to get to
[1:18:15] if I've said it this many times in order
[1:18:16] to get to a chapter 38 in the book of
[1:18:19] Job where God comes down and speaks to
[1:18:24] him face to face there had to be a
[1:18:27] testing and a trying and a going through
[1:18:30] now God is remember we go back to that
[1:18:32] first chapter and Satan had gone before
[1:18:35] God and said and God asked him what are
[1:18:37] you been doing he says I'm just going to
[1:18:39] and fro looking around seen see what
[1:18:40] mischief I can cause looking at you I
[1:18:43] can trip over see who I can cause to
[1:18:45] fail that's that's what I do
[1:18:47] and he's good at it yeah and he says
[1:18:51] have you considered my
[1:18:53] job you know I would say Lord hey you
[1:18:57] know don't do that to me but that's how
[1:19:01] you find out where you stand and he says
[1:19:04] yeah I've considered him I walked around
[1:19:06] but I really can't get to him because
[1:19:07] there's a hedge all the way around
[1:19:08] there's a fence all the way you've got
[1:19:10] him well-protected he says so you know
[1:19:15] and so we know that part of the story he
[1:19:17] allowed Satan to come down
[1:19:19] nothing happens that God is not aware of
[1:19:22] that God doesn't have his hand but
[1:19:24] there's a testing of trying and
[1:19:26] approving of his children
[1:19:28] you know when the teacher says let's
[1:19:30] take a test it's let's find out if
[1:19:34] you've learned what we've been working
[1:19:36] on what we've been studying what we've
[1:19:38] been what we've been taught on that
[1:19:40] that's what he tells us so we get to
[1:19:42] Hebrews chapter 12 verses 5 through 11
[1:19:46] and have you forgotten the exhortation
[1:19:49] which speaketh unto us as unto children
[1:19:52] my son despise not the chastening of the
[1:19:56] Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of
[1:19:59] him you know it's one of those things
[1:20:04] you know and I'll just say this and I
[1:20:06] have to say because it was units in my
[1:20:09] family and we'd tell the girls you know
[1:20:11] I need to talk to y'all and you know sit
[1:20:15] him down and sometimes there's a whole
[1:20:17] family sometimes individually and then
[1:20:19] later on in life as he got older and
[1:20:21] they would tell us we'd say or my wife
[1:20:24] would say dad says he wants to talk to
[1:20:25] us all let's see let's go to the living
[1:20:27] room and they I would hear them among
[1:20:29] themselves laughing okay is this is this
[1:20:31] lesson number 11 or is this lesson
[1:20:33] number 13 and it would kind of laugh
[1:20:35] about it but it was something we would
[1:20:37] sit down and he goes you know it is
[1:20:41] something we would sit down what we need
[1:20:42] to address this thing we need to deal
[1:20:44] with this whatever it might be
[1:20:46] sometimes discipline sometimes good news
[1:20:50] whatever it was you know he says and
[1:20:53] don't be faint don't don't don't
[1:20:56] how would I say in faint don't get so
[1:20:58] weak either one way Lord how come you're
[1:21:01] always after me or Oh Lord I'm just no
[1:21:04] good
[1:21:05] yes Lee he says don't be fake because
[1:21:08] then he answers it let's go into six for
[1:21:11] whom the Lord loveth he chasing it and
[1:21:15] scourgeth every son whom he receiveth
[1:21:19] if you endure chastening God dealeth
[1:21:22] with you as with sons for what son is he
[1:21:26] whom the father chased myth not brother
[1:21:29] branham taught taught adoption under
[1:21:31] this a son was tested was tried he was
[1:21:35] going through and and if he didn't come
[1:21:37] through and he showed he was still a son
[1:21:39] but he was not adopted the business was
[1:21:42] not handed over to him it was never
[1:21:44] given the checkbook with the authority
[1:21:46] to use it let's go on so put it if you
[1:21:54] be without chastisement whereof all are
[1:21:56] partakers then you're bastards and not
[1:21:58] sons you are not born a child a clod
[1:22:01] it's pretty simple so if you are a child
[1:22:05] of God if you are being test and tried
[1:22:07] that's a good sign that God loves you
[1:22:10] that God's thinking about you that God
[1:22:12] once he knows what's in you and he's
[1:22:14] going to bring it out
[1:22:15] it says furthermore we have had fathers
[1:22:17] of our flesh which corrected us and we
[1:22:20] gave them reverence shall we not much
[1:22:23] more rather be in subjection unto the
[1:22:26] father of spirits and live let's go on
[1:22:30] finish them for they verily for a few
[1:22:33] days chasing us after their own pleasure
[1:22:35] but he for our profit
[1:22:38] he said that we might be partakers of
[1:22:41] his holiness now no chastening for the
[1:22:44] present seems to be joyous but Grievous
[1:22:46] nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the
[1:22:49] peaceable fruit of righteousness unto
[1:22:51] them which are exercised thereby you say
[1:22:55] Wow
[1:22:56] Lord I need some more exercise I need to
[1:23:00] work with this some more I'm willing
[1:23:02] Lord I surrender I yield to that Lord
[1:23:05] there are some things in my life some
[1:23:07] ways that there's still trouble me some
[1:23:10] some reactions that I have sometimes so
[1:23:13] Lord if it pleases a father
[1:23:16] there's some more you know what you're
[1:23:20] what you're saying you're saying Lord
[1:23:22] chastised me where I need chastisement
[1:23:24] but I Joe I'll say I shall then come
[1:23:28] forth ice cold and I didn't put the
[1:23:32] scripture and but Peter says think it
[1:23:35] not strange
[1:23:36] when fiery fiery trials when you go
[1:23:39] through some hard times when these
[1:23:41] things see me don't think it's strange
[1:23:42] it's part of the life it's part of the
[1:23:45] process when a seed is planted into the
[1:23:48] granite ground it has to die we wouldn't
[1:23:52] think life is going to come out of death
[1:23:53] but if we can kill this old nature the
[1:23:57] shell around us so that life can be born
[1:23:59] the life of God and then fruit can be
[1:24:02] born no it won't be too much too much
[1:24:09] longer here but Psalms 139 David we know
[1:24:18] the life of David and it's well written
[1:24:21] through through the Old Testament a man
[1:24:25] after God's own heart but I found David
[1:24:28] I find David to be a man also human
[1:24:31] flesh subject to temptations subject to
[1:24:35] failures numbers the people when he was
[1:24:39] told not to number why not number the
[1:24:41] people because then you look at it and
[1:24:43] say hey we did this in our strength and
[1:24:45] God doesn't get the glory and when you
[1:24:47] don't give God the glory you're in
[1:24:48] trouble you gonna pay for that but when
[1:24:51] you say it's not not by might not my
[1:24:54] power but by this spirit saith the Lord
[1:24:56] you know and David had learned that as a
[1:24:59] young man as he's growing up and he's a
[1:25:02] sheepherder he's taking care of the
[1:25:04] sheep of his father as a young man and
[1:25:06] you know and he realizes and and he sees
[1:25:10] that bear has that encounter with the
[1:25:11] bear and the and the lion and and he
[1:25:14] just knows hey these are my father's
[1:25:16] sheep it's my responsibility to take
[1:25:18] care of them we know that he wrote these
[1:25:23] Psalms and he sings them and the
[1:25:25] different things you know at what age he
[1:25:27] started I don't know maybe that's what
[1:25:29] he was doing well
[1:25:29] washing watching the sheep but somewhere
[1:25:32] someplace in that he realized these are
[1:25:34] my father's sheep I got to protect him
[1:25:36] and he went after the lion and he went
[1:25:38] after the bear something inspired him to
[1:25:42] do that so now when he comes to Goliath
[1:25:46] his father sends him go see how your
[1:25:48] brothers are doing and take them this a
[1:25:50] little bit of bread and cheese there's
[1:25:51] there's you know and it's you know give
[1:25:53] them a get out there and see how they're
[1:25:55] doing and he walks onto the scene of
[1:25:57] Goliath there's this big giant standing
[1:26:01] there threatening the armies of the
[1:26:03] Living God and David goes back to what
[1:26:07] he had just gone through and he looks
[1:26:09] and he says you know there was a lion
[1:26:11] and there was a bear and God met me
[1:26:14] there he gave me the strength the
[1:26:16] ability to take care of the Sheep this
[1:26:19] man is no different why is it no
[1:26:21] different then because God is still the
[1:26:23] same yesterday today and forever it
[1:26:26] wasn't just God on the back over there
[1:26:27] he's still here today
[1:26:29] you know I was listening to a man and
[1:26:32] and the tie his thought was what was the
[1:26:37] secret to brother branham's ministry and
[1:26:39] he was not a con quote a believer but he
[1:26:42] talked about the sacrifice the humility
[1:26:45] the the the willingness to surrender all
[1:26:48] to have that ability to have God moved
[1:26:50] that way which is the truth and took a
[1:26:54] lot it takes a lot out of us you know
[1:27:00] let me maybe that's not the way it said
[1:27:02] but for to get it all out of us shall I
[1:27:04] say it that way we have to be willing to
[1:27:06] say yes Lord because we are we as humans
[1:27:11] we find our own ways there so is we know
[1:27:13] of the life of David there were some
[1:27:16] great victories and there was some
[1:27:18] pretty low times too there was some
[1:27:21] times where David like you said I could
[1:27:23] I could run through a troop and leap
[1:27:25] over a wall and there was another time
[1:27:28] when he had a man put to death so he
[1:27:29] could take his wife you and I would have
[1:27:32] never forgiven him of that but God it
[1:27:37] was happening
[1:27:38] tip god call said a man after my own
[1:27:40] heart sometimes we won't even let our
[1:27:44] brother and our sister sit close to us
[1:27:46] yet God said of David a man after my own
[1:27:50] heart as through the trial sister though
[1:27:54] things God orchestrates them to bring
[1:27:58] that character in us so here's David O
[1:28:00] Lord thou has searched me and known me
[1:28:04] thou know'st us my down City and mine
[1:28:06] uprising when I when I sit down when I
[1:28:09] get out of bed when we you know every
[1:28:11] part of my life there's nothing that the
[1:28:14] catch is used for thou understand this
[1:28:16] my thoughts are far off you know it's
[1:28:19] it's one of those things that I thank
[1:28:21] God that the blood of Jesus Christ is
[1:28:23] there for us how the Lord showed that to
[1:28:26] brother Branham and he said look when
[1:28:28] you're trying to condemn this this these
[1:28:30] people in this this place watch what's
[1:28:33] happening with your and brother and says
[1:28:34] those are my senses yes they're yours he
[1:28:39] says you know those things from afar off
[1:28:40] and he puts a blood barrier there that's
[1:28:44] why it's so important for us to have the
[1:28:46] token it's a matter of life and death
[1:28:49] really without the token there is no
[1:28:53] life it's a serious thing he says he
[1:28:57] says thou compassing my path and my
[1:28:59] lying down and are acquainted with my
[1:29:01] ways ah there's that same word he's
[1:29:04] telling McWane ty self job with him and
[1:29:06] and David says to him you're acquainted
[1:29:09] with my ways there there's a personal
[1:29:11] relationship you're familiar with you
[1:29:14] know in in it's the same way in a
[1:29:17] working relationship at your job in a
[1:29:20] family relationship what it was you you
[1:29:23] become acquainted with one another you
[1:29:25] know you're around each other you see
[1:29:28] each other and and if time if you spend
[1:29:31] enough time on you get to see both sides
[1:29:33] when somebody gets angry somebody gets
[1:29:35] upset something doesn't go right what's
[1:29:38] their reaction and then you get to see
[1:29:41] the good side also or maybe when someone
[1:29:44] receives honor or thing how do they how
[1:29:47] do they take you to see all parts of in
[1:29:49] that acquaintance in that fellowship in
[1:29:52] relationship you know and in sometimes
[1:29:55] we you go back and and you look in a
[1:29:57] relationship that's lasted a long time
[1:29:59] that over the years everything and you
[1:30:02] see if you'll be honest with him hey
[1:30:03] there were some hard times there were
[1:30:06] some good times but by the grace of God
[1:30:09] we're still we're still here you know
[1:30:11] you look back at Tucson tabernacle and
[1:30:14] first time for us was in 1975 yeah 75 we
[1:30:20] came to the meetings of December here
[1:30:21] and then we moved here in 76 when we
[1:30:23] came to the meetings for a few years
[1:30:25] there's been many years of history now
[1:30:29] there was a period of time that we did
[1:30:31] we weren't here at all but then from
[1:30:33] 1988 this way so there is a lot of could
[1:30:36] I say a relationship built some good a
[1:30:40] lot of good and some hard times too but
[1:30:45] you know and in the hard times when we
[1:30:48] really show our nature and our character
[1:30:50] wherever it is and that's when you can
[1:30:52] say oh Lord
[1:30:53] I need some help I need some more work
[1:30:56] this is the l word acquainted with all
[1:31:01] my ways there's nothing hid before you
[1:31:03] for there is not a word in my tongue but
[1:31:06] Lord O Lord that thou knowest it all
[1:31:08] together
[1:31:09] thou has beset me behind and before and
[1:31:13] laid nine hand upon me you're in front
[1:31:16] of me you're behind me you're all around
[1:31:18] me I cannot hide him and then he says
[1:31:24] such one knowledge is too wonderful for
[1:31:26] me it is high I can attain unto it
[1:31:30] sometimes I've stopped for a minute just
[1:31:32] try to God see this how'd it but it's
[1:31:36] not me to figure it out but to accept it
[1:31:38] and thank them for it Lord you're in
[1:31:40] command you're in control I don't need
[1:31:42] to be in in fear and worry about your
[1:31:44] knowledge no one has ever come to you
[1:31:46] and you had to ask them help me on this
[1:31:48] but I've had to come to you many a times
[1:31:51] Lord say help me on this you know and
[1:31:54] this is David understanding I can't even
[1:31:56] come close to it let's go on weather
[1:32:01] shall I go from thy spirit or whether
[1:32:03] shall I free from thy presence
[1:32:05] if I send up into heaven thou art there
[1:32:07] if I make my bed in hell behold thou art
[1:32:10] there also he says you've got that every
[1:32:13] situation every places is in your hands
[1:32:15] you control it it doesn't control you
[1:32:17] you control it he says if I take the
[1:32:21] wings of the morning and dwell in the
[1:32:23] uttermost part of the sea that's
[1:32:27] continuing even there shall thy hand
[1:32:30] lead me and thy right hand shall hold me
[1:32:33] and brother Matt talked about the storms
[1:32:35] out in the middle of the sea he says
[1:32:38] even if I flee out there you still have
[1:32:41] it under your control I'm not going to
[1:32:44] hide I'm not gonna be all there by a
[1:32:45] moth neither am I gonna hide and either
[1:32:47] no I need to be afraid that I'm alone
[1:32:49] you're still there if I say surely the
[1:32:53] darkness shall cover me even the night
[1:32:55] shall be light about me
[1:32:57] yea the darkness hide us not from thee
[1:32:59] but the night shine is after the day the
[1:33:02] darkness and the light are both alight
[1:33:04] to thee to God is no different
[1:33:06] he's not affected by dark moods and
[1:33:10] happy moods he's not our good times and
[1:33:14] our bad times in the sense that oh what
[1:33:17] do I do now no he loves his children he
[1:33:20] doesn't want to see them broken but he
[1:33:22] also needs knows then there are some
[1:33:24] times that we need to be broken
[1:33:26] we need our heart how can I be touched
[1:33:29] by the feeling of my brother my sister
[1:33:30] my loved one if I haven't gone through
[1:33:33] some of the similar situations if my
[1:33:36] life has been so high and better than
[1:33:38] everybody else that I could look down
[1:33:39] know but if I walk in that same place I
[1:33:42] guess a yes brother yes sister you know
[1:33:44] yes honey yes child is yes daughter yes
[1:33:47] son I can be touched by the feeling of
[1:33:49] your infirmities also I've been there he
[1:33:53] says it's all light unto thee he says
[1:33:56] let's go on for thou has possessed my
[1:34:00] reigns thou has covered me in my
[1:34:02] mother's womb Jeremiah he told him even
[1:34:04] before you were in your when you and
[1:34:07] your mother you were ordained a prophet
[1:34:10] God wasn't there oh my goodness I need a
[1:34:13] prophet where is there one around here
[1:34:14] I'll shoot that guy he lets know it was
[1:34:17] already setting car
[1:34:18] mine's in God's plan he says I won't
[1:34:21] praise thee for I am fearfully and
[1:34:24] wonderfully made marvelous are thy works
[1:34:27] and that my soul knoweth right well he
[1:34:31] says I am fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:34:35] everything that God does he does it
[1:34:37] right and for a purpose 17 and 18 how
[1:34:42] precious also are they thought son to me
[1:34:44] O God how great is the sum of them
[1:34:48] everything that God has planned for you
[1:34:50] everything that he has thought of you
[1:34:52] that he has seen you in already he said
[1:34:56] they are precious how great is this some
[1:34:58] of them it's just not a moment or
[1:35:00] something there but it's an eternal
[1:35:02] brother ran touches out he said you were
[1:35:05] in the back part of his mind from
[1:35:08] eternity so how long has this
[1:35:11] relationship between you and God been
[1:35:12] it's eternal
[1:35:14] it's not new to him it's he's realizing
[1:35:18] hey these thoughts that I had and and
[1:35:21] and he knew what name you that you would
[1:35:23] have you know it's already he said
[1:35:26] they're written in the palms of my hand
[1:35:28] every one of them he said how great if I
[1:35:32] should count them they are more in
[1:35:34] number than the sand and when I awake I
[1:35:37] am still with you in the morning when I
[1:35:42] rise give me Jesus you know why because
[1:35:47] he's there that's not like Lord where
[1:35:51] are you you know I need you to show up
[1:35:53] about right now he says I am here I've
[1:35:55] never left you I've never left you after
[1:35:57] you he said if I could count them he
[1:36:01] said they're more in number than the
[1:36:04] sand and when I am awake I am with thee
[1:36:08] show for it like I said I wouldn't be
[1:36:10] long today if I could sum it up this way
[1:36:12] those trials those things that you're
[1:36:16] going through in life the hard times and
[1:36:19] you know I look at here and I see the
[1:36:22] age variance from a sister Lily probably
[1:36:26] being the youngest one here and brother
[1:36:28] Arnie I think
[1:36:30] is the senior here but you know in in
[1:36:33] life over time each one of us have gone
[1:36:35] through our things parts that we've gone
[1:36:38] through in life and each one has had its
[1:36:41] purpose well now sister Lily she might
[1:36:44] you know think well you know I've gone
[1:36:46] through this at the other and she has
[1:36:48] you know and maybe my wife would say
[1:36:52] yeah but you know you haven't gone
[1:36:53] through this this and this yet she has
[1:36:55] but we can help one another we can
[1:36:58] encouragement I've been there where you
[1:36:59] been that's what David is saying he says
[1:37:02] you know all of this you've seen it it's
[1:37:05] not a surprise to you you have an answer
[1:37:07] you've made a provision for it
[1:37:09] and the scripture even tells you older
[1:37:12] sisters teach the younger ones why
[1:37:13] because you've been there you've had
[1:37:16] those experiences you've known it you
[1:37:18] know let the elder teach the younger you
[1:37:21] know you that are that are further along
[1:37:24] in your experience further along with
[1:37:25] God because you've been here longer and
[1:37:27] if you travel this year turn around and
[1:37:29] encourage the one say I've been there
[1:37:31] before but God helped me through it this
[1:37:32] way God encouraged me this way God gave
[1:37:35] me strength like this it's not the end
[1:37:38] of the world for you right now you're
[1:37:41] going through a hard time you're going
[1:37:42] through a battle things don't seem the
[1:37:44] way but there is light at the end of the
[1:37:46] tunnel I've been there where you're at
[1:37:48] when it seemed that I opened my wallet
[1:37:51] and there just wasn't anything in there
[1:37:53] open the cupboard and there was nothing
[1:37:55] there but God still met our need God
[1:37:59] still provided how many times have you
[1:38:02] read in the testimonies through history
[1:38:04] where I don't remember who it was but it
[1:38:07] was one of the you know back in a few
[1:38:11] centuries ago where they would be
[1:38:12] praying there maybe one of the
[1:38:14] missionaries in the books that we had
[1:38:15] there they would be praying because
[1:38:17] there's no food to feed the children and
[1:38:19] a milk truck breaks down right in front
[1:38:21] of the house and the guy comes to knocks
[1:38:24] on the door he says I'm my milk truck is
[1:38:26] broken down here or the the wagon that
[1:38:28] I'm taking and I can't go so would you
[1:38:30] take this milk before it goes bad God
[1:38:33] meets the needs of his children and he
[1:38:36] has a purpose for it but every part is
[1:38:39] to test us to try us to bring us to a
[1:38:42] place like Joe said
[1:38:44] I shall then come forth as gold because
[1:38:48] it's gold in me now there's a question
[1:38:51] and my wife posted it I think it was I
[1:38:54] think it was her that she said or maybe
[1:38:57] I read it somewhere how many apples are
[1:39:02] in the apple tree all of them it's not a
[1:39:09] trick question
[1:39:10] how much of God is in each one him all
[1:39:13] of him not this much for you and you
[1:39:17] just get this little board its Christ in
[1:39:19] you you know on in acts 2:38 he broke
[1:39:23] himself apart into the into licks of
[1:39:25] fire and he himself dwelled in each one
[1:39:27] filled him with the Holy Spirit this one
[1:39:29] didn't have 5% in that one God no it was
[1:39:32] Christ in each one of them that which
[1:39:34] God has purpose for your life will come
[1:39:37] forth so when you're going through the
[1:39:40] hard times it's not God's punishment
[1:39:42] it's God bringing and showing that
[1:39:45] through these storms through these hard
[1:39:47] times
[1:39:48] you shall come forth as gold the
[1:39:50] musicians would would make their way up
[1:39:54] sometimes we get to filling in Lord I
[1:39:56] must I must just be a failure it seems
[1:39:58] like nothing goes right in my life
[1:40:00] everything goes backwards is it you
[1:40:03] nothing but God says no I have a purpose
[1:40:05] and all of that I have there's some
[1:40:07] training for you to go through some
[1:40:09] sometimes we just need to sit down and
[1:40:11] be quiet for a little bit and say Lord
[1:40:13] that my spirit settle and then you can
[1:40:16] minister to me God leads his dear
[1:40:19] children along some through the water
[1:40:23] some through the flood
[1:40:26] and God leads history let's pray Lord we
[1:40:31] we spoken we feel what you had for us
[1:40:34] today sometimes Lord we we wonder Lord
[1:40:39] why why me
[1:40:40] it seems like my brother and sister are
[1:40:43] having a much easier time about it seems
[1:40:45] like I'm struggling so hard but if we
[1:40:49] were in their shoes they'd be looking at
[1:40:50] us the same way saying it seems like my
[1:40:52] brother my sister's just doing fine and
[1:40:55] I'm struggling but God you lead every
[1:40:59] one of your children in a way some
[1:41:01] through the water some through the flood
[1:41:03] and there's a purpose for all ordinates
[1:41:06] brother Matt lettuce and that song I
[1:41:08] surrender all Lord maybe just be willing
[1:41:11] to say that Lord I yield I surrender my
[1:41:14] motives
[1:41:14] I surrender my attitude I surrender my
[1:41:17] heart I surrender my all to you Lord and
[1:41:20] let you have preeminence Lord maybe
[1:41:23] somebody has a question was wondering
[1:41:25] about why they were going through these
[1:41:26] things in their life may they realize it
[1:41:29] because they are your children and
[1:41:32] you're bringing that gold that's in them
[1:41:35] which is full manifestation we thank you
[1:41:37] for in Jesus Christ's name Amen
