[15:11] Ed makes way for the prayer requests and
[15:13] offerings, uh, Brother Steve Robson in
[15:17] Flagstaff is having some meetings um,
[15:20] August 1st through the 3rd. Um, if any
[15:23] of the youth um, want to come, either
[15:25] get in contact with me or my dad or even
[15:28] the parents. Um, but that's just my
[15:30] announcement.
[15:32] [Music]
[15:48] It's good to be in the house of the Lord
[15:50] this morning. We have a number of
[15:52] requests like to bring before you.
[15:57] Our brother Paul Batazi
[16:00] is due to have surgery tomorrow. He's
[16:03] asked for prayer.
[16:09] Sister Joy, the one with Alex,
[16:13] she writes in, "My cousin Jarrett passed
[16:16] away yesterday evening and for my mom
[16:19] whose health continues to decline with
[16:21] stage 4 cancer throughout her whole
[16:23] body."
[16:24] [Music]
[16:27] Sister Connie Williams says, "Thank you
[16:29] for the prayers for my sister, Kelly
[16:32] Drapper. She had open heart surgery and
[16:35] a stroke that partially paralyzed her.
[16:37] She is now starting to fill to get
[16:40] filling and is doing much better. Prayer
[16:42] changes things. Do you believe that?
[16:46] Sister Amelia has asked, "Please keep
[16:50] her daughter Eva in in our prayers.
[16:53] She's been sick about a week."
[16:57] Brother Tim Cruz has also asked
[17:01] um prayer for his mom. She recently was
[17:04] diagnosed with a illness in her lungs
[17:06] that makes it difficult to breathe.
[17:08] Praying for a touch from the Lord.
[17:12] Know how hard it is when you have
[17:14] breathing difficulties.
[17:18] There was a prayer request I'd like to
[17:20] bring on behalf of uh my sister-in-law
[17:26] Um, sorry. I I thought I had it. Uh, but
[17:32] my si our sister-in-law, sister Susan,
[17:44] you probably saw the WhatsApp request
[17:47] this week. She's been diagnosed with um
[17:54] uh
[17:56] saroma cancer in her abdomen.
[17:59] They are supposed to
[18:02] go tomorrow to the surgeon doctor to see
[18:07] what course of action they'll take.
[18:10] This really is most likely impacting the
[18:14] family quite a bit to have that happen.
[18:18] Brother France has been a real servant
[18:22] of God over in Europe. Um
[18:26] they're trusting in the Lord for a touch
[18:32] [Music]
[18:33] there was something I wanted.
[18:37] The Lord says, you know, he's touched by
[18:39] the filling of our infirmities
[18:42] and by his stripes were healed. So, if
[18:45] you have a request that you'd like to
[18:46] make known to the Lord with an uplifted
[18:49] hand, let's let's go to the Lord.
[18:55] Our gracious heavenly father,
[18:59] Lord, we just sang. We see the
[19:01] fulfillment of your promises.
[19:04] We see the fulfillment, Lord, of your
[19:07] word taking place in our lives this
[19:09] morning. And we thank you, Lord, for
[19:11] this opportunity to be in your house.
[19:15] And Father, first of all, we'd like to
[19:17] ask that if there's anything that's
[19:18] hindering the moving of your spirit this
[19:21] morning, would you take control of it
[19:24] and may it be removed from this
[19:27] building, Lord?
[19:29] And would you have the freedom to move
[19:31] up and down the aisles with your
[19:33] presence and bless each one that's here,
[19:37] Lord? We invite you into our midst. Your
[19:40] word says, Lord, where two or three are
[19:43] gathered, ye would be in our midst.
[19:48] But Lord, your your word also said, ask
[19:50] in faith, believing that your joys may
[19:53] be full.
[19:54] [Music]
[20:01] these requests. Lord,
[20:04] we're asking that you
[20:06] look down upon them. You've heard them.
[20:08] You've seen the hands that have been
[20:10] raised.
[20:12] And we'd ask, Lord, that you your
[20:14] healing virtue would go forth.
[20:18] Answer each request, Lord.
[20:22] that Lord, these requests that have been
[20:26] written out that you would receive honor
[20:29] and glory,
[20:32] Lord, that's the whole purpose.
[20:35] These things that come upon us, Lord,
[20:39] we desire that you receive honor and
[20:41] glory.
[20:44] Now, Father, as with the remainder of
[20:46] this service, the songs that are still
[20:49] to be sung,
[20:51] the bringing forth of your word, Lord,
[20:54] bless our brother Daniel, Lord, as he
[20:56] brings forth that which you've laid upon
[20:58] his heart. Anoint our
[21:01] our ears and our heart to hear and to
[21:03] receive.
[21:04] [Music]
[21:06] And the offering that's about to be
[21:08] taken up, bless the giver. bless the
[21:11] offering for its intended use
[21:14] and we give you praise, honor and glory,
[21:17] dear Lord.
[21:19] Thank you in the precious name of Jesus
[21:21] Christ. Amen.

[31:56] God bless you all. Welcome. It's It's
[31:58] good to have you in service. Welcome our
[32:00] visitors, friends.
[32:07] more over here. Welcome. God bless you.
[32:11] I'm I'm excited. I'm excited to be back
[32:14] home. had a had a really good trip.
[32:18] And I was telling brother Ed
[32:22] before uh before service that
[32:25] I've spoke spoken many times at many
[32:27] different churches over the past few
[32:29] years.
[32:30] But I've always felt like this really
[32:35] wasn't what the Lord wanted me to do
[32:38] when I went. And I would pray and felt
[32:42] like the Lord would say, "No, go,
[32:46] but it's really this isn't my will, but
[32:48] still go and and be a blessing, but this
[32:52] isn't what I want you to do." And I know
[32:56] I mean, the Lord's revealed it to me. My
[32:58] role is here as a pastor of this church.
[33:00] That's that's my role.
[33:02] And this past trip was really the first
[33:06] time that I felt a strong leading from
[33:11] the Lord to go. And I'll tell you, when
[33:14] you go somewhere
[33:16] and it's just you feeling like this is
[33:20] something that you should do,
[33:22] the feeling is much different than if
[33:24] you go somewhere and you are going
[33:26] somewhere in the name of the Lord Jesus
[33:28] Christ. When you do that, then you know
[33:32] that God's with you and whatever enemy,
[33:36] whatever the enemy throws against you,
[33:38] you know, Lord, I am in your will. And
[33:41] that's how this trip was. I felt like
[33:44] this is what the Lord the Lord wanted to
[33:47] send somebody from this church to these
[33:50] folks up in Quebec. And he blessed it.
[33:54] He blessed it richly. I um
[34:00] when Joshua
[34:02] went over the Jordan River,
[34:05] he told the the people, he said, "Put
[34:09] the ark of the covenant before you." He
[34:12] said, "Because you haven't gone this way
[34:14] before,
[34:16] keep that ark in your eyes. Keep it in
[34:18] front of you." And that's how I feel
[34:21] with even the direction of our church
[34:24] here is put the word in front of us and
[34:28] the Lord is leading. The Lord is leading
[34:30] in a different direction. He's he's
[34:31] moving us. And to be in the foundation
[34:35] of of what the Lord is doing is just
[34:38] it's tremendous. When I was in Quebec, I
[34:40] preached on investments and I said that
[34:43] when you make an investment in a stock
[34:45] or when you make an investment in a
[34:46] company, you are not investing in what
[34:49] that company is right now. You're
[34:51] investing in what that company can be.
[34:55] And that is what I believe is going on
[34:57] right now. I believe that all of us in
[35:00] this room, we are on the ground floor of
[35:03] what God and God is going to take this
[35:06] church and he is going to bless it, I
[35:10] believe, beyond measure. He's already
[35:11] blessing us.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; He's already doing mighty things among
[35:14] us. And I believe that there are great
[35:17] times ahead of us. And and going to
[35:20] Quebec,
[35:21] it just it it it just it was tremendous.
[35:25] And I see these churches and they're
[35:28] moving in a certain direction that
[35:31] they're getting away
[35:34] from a failed model. They're getting
[35:37] away from something that didn't work. It
[35:40] didn't work for their children. It
[35:42] didn't work for their lives. And it just
[35:44] brought it brought some depression. And
[35:45] it and and there wasn't new converts.
[35:47] There wasn't healings. There there there
[35:49] wasn't people giving their hearts at the
[35:51] altar. There wasn't deliverance. There
[35:54] weren't those things. And then there
[35:55] wasn't the churches weren't growing.
[35:57] They were just shrinking and things
[35:58] weren't working. But when they started
[36:01] to preach this novel concept of Jesus
[36:04] Christ,
[36:06] when they started to preach him,
[36:10] things started to change.
[36:13] People started coming.
[36:15] People maybe that hadn't been to church
[36:17] in a long time started coming. Family
[36:21] members started feeling welcome in their
[36:24] church. Neighbors started coming.
[36:29] People were delivered
[36:32] of of suffering. People were delivered
[36:34] of sin that they had that they had were
[36:37] carrying for years. And then they were
[36:39] able to come to a church and find joy
[36:42] joy in the Lord. And what they found was
[36:46] they didn't find any more judgmental
[36:49] attitudes. They found love and they
[36:51] found acceptance and they found a place
[36:53] that I want to be part of these
[36:55] churches. And let me tell you friends,
[36:58] it it was it's amazing what's going on.
[37:03] It's not just here.
[37:05] It's going on in other places of the
[37:07] world
[37:09] where people are saying, you know what,
[37:11] I want to focus on my savior. I don't
[37:15] want to focus on these doctrines that
[37:18] have divided us that haven't resulted in
[37:20] anything. I want to focus on a living,
[37:24] resurrected Jesus Christ that delivers
[37:27] me from my sins, that delivers me from
[37:30] everything that I used to be, that
[37:32] changes me. That's what I want to that's
[37:35] what I want to focus on. And when you do
[37:37] that, there is freedom. There is liberty
[37:40] in Jesus Christ. And you see then the
[37:43] doors start to open and then you see the
[37:46] book of Acts start to start to take
[37:48] place in your local church and you see
[37:51] people start coming in and people being
[37:53] healed and people giving their hearts to
[37:55] the Lord and it is just it's tremendous
[37:57] seeing it. It's tremendous seeing it
[37:59] right here in what we are doing and then
[38:01] seeing it in other places. It is
[38:04] friends. It's Christianity in action.
[38:08] It's Jesus Christ doing the works that
[38:11] he has always done and doing them again
[38:14] today.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Jordan mentioned he says, "Well,
[38:18] you you should maybe give some of these
[38:19] testimonies
[38:21] and I I will share I'll share a couple
[38:23] of them.
[38:25] I was uh I was ministering on brother Lo
[38:28] is uh Ko Hano over there. I was
[38:32] ministering on um the same subject that
[38:37] Kaleo came and and got baptized that
[38:41] day.
[38:42] And it was about the parable of the fig
[38:48] tree that didn't produce any fruit. And
[38:51] it just took some love. It took somebody
[38:54] to stand up for that tree. And here the
[38:57] worker in the vineyard is and the the
[38:59] master is like, "Cut it down." The thing
[39:01] doesn't bear any figs. It's all leaves
[39:03] and no figs. And the the the person that
[39:05] worked in the in not the vineyard, but
[39:07] the orchard, he says, "Just let me let
[39:09] me have it just for a little bit. Let me
[39:11] dig around the the base of it. Brother
[39:14] Joe, remember it's just what a what an
[39:17] incredible story that is. Let me just
[39:18] dig around the base of it. Let me put
[39:21] some fertilizer in there. Let me put
[39:23] some water in there and just give this
[39:25] tree a little bit of love."
[39:28] And as I was ministering on that,
[39:32] um,
[39:33] a new convert had an experience
[39:38] after after the service went over to the
[39:41] pastor's house and he was attending. Um,
[39:46] so the the two churches that I
[39:47] ministered at were two two hours away.
[39:49] And this brother, new con, new person in
[39:53] the church, he drove two hours, more
[39:56] than two hours to come hear me minister
[40:00] because he was going to miss me when I
[40:01] was going to be there the next day. I
[40:03] had to work. I think he's a fireman. And
[40:05] he was on shift. So he drove all of that
[40:08] way to this other church.
[40:12] And as he was hearing that testimony, as
[40:17] he was hearing where where you dig
[40:19] around the tree and and you love these
[40:21] people, no matter if you don't see any
[40:23] potential in them at all, it doesn't
[40:26] matter. Just dig around the base, let it
[40:29] get water, water it, give it love, and
[40:32] just let the Lord give the increase. as
[40:34] I was ministering on that, he had an
[40:38] experience and he afterwards he uh he
[40:40] was really embarrassed and he came to me
[40:43] and he says um hey can I talk to you for
[40:46] a minute and I said I said yeah sure so
[40:49] so we went off kind of by ourselves and
[40:52] he said uh
[40:54] uh something happened to me remember
[40:57] this guy's never been to church he had
[40:58] been he had been a couple times the
[41:01] pastor had witnessed to him and he was
[41:03] he was coming. I think he was just
[41:05] walking by the service one day and he
[41:07] came in, brother Juan, kind of like like
[41:09] you. You just decided to come in and he
[41:13] uh
[41:15] he started listening to uh this pastor,
[41:18] Joel is his name. He started listening
[41:20] to him and he he really liked it. Well,
[41:22] as I said, he made the two-hour trip
[41:24] over to to hear me minister at this
[41:26] other place, and he said he was
[41:28] embarrassed. And he said, "Something
[41:31] happened to me."
[41:33] He said, "I saw something while you were
[41:36] ministering."
[41:38] And I said, "No, it's okay, brother." He
[41:40] says, "No, but it was really weird." And
[41:43] I said, "No." He said, "It was God." He
[41:46] said, "It was God. I know it was God." I
[41:49] said, "What happened?
[41:51] He said, "I saw myself and there was
[41:56] fire all over the place." And he said,
[41:59] "I felt the heat of the fire." And he
[42:04] said, "As you were talking about that
[42:06] fig tree," he says, he says, "I had one
[42:09] hand up on God and the other hand I had
[42:15] praying for someone else." And he says,
[42:18] "All the fire was all around me." And he
[42:20] says, "I I saw myself there with one
[42:22] hand on God and one hand on this this
[42:24] other person praying for them." And he
[42:26] says, "I don't know what happened." I
[42:27] was like, "Oh, brother." I said, "I want
[42:30] you to pray for me." That kind of a gift
[42:33] and and what had happened to him. And he
[42:36] had never been to church before. He
[42:37] didn't know what a vision was. And you
[42:40] say, "Brother Daniel, are you saying
[42:41] that this this young man had a vision?"
[42:44] Yes.
[42:46] Why not? If Peter could have a vision on
[42:49] the housetop,
[42:51] if Paul could have a vision on the ship,
[42:53] if Philillip could have a vision in the
[42:55] desert, why can we not have visions
[42:59] today? Why could not God work in that
[43:01] way today? He can. And then this
[43:06] actually he's getting baptized today.
[43:14] Yeah. the the pastor the pastor told me
[43:18] he's he's really excited and now leading
[43:21] this man leading his family now to the
[43:25] Lord, his children and his um his wife
[43:30] um
[43:32] before. So that was that was the first
[43:34] service I preached. And then I went to
[43:37] preach at uh this other church and I
[43:41] preached five sermons in four days and
[43:44] two hours between two and a half hours
[43:46] between the two churches. So it was it
[43:48] was pretty intense. So I went to the
[43:53] second church. Brother Joel is the
[43:55] pastor. The first church is an
[43:57] established church kind of like we are
[43:59] very very similar to us and uh just
[44:03] tremendous people just blessed me so
[44:05] much. They even it was it was on my
[44:07] birthday they had kind of a surprise
[44:09] birthday party for me where they all
[44:11] signed uh they all wrote a note to me
[44:13] and they put this card together just so
[44:15] sweet just so accepting. And then I went
[44:18] to this the other church and and they
[44:19] kind of did the same thing. And
[44:23] while I was there, I was up in the
[44:25] office, the ministers, the pastor's
[44:28] office,
[44:29] and I was praying,
[44:32] I said, "Lord,
[44:34] it's written that whatever you do in
[44:37] word or deed to all in the name of the
[44:39] Lord Jesus." And I said, 'Lord, if I
[44:42] could just
[44:44] know
[44:46] that I'm in your will. If I could just
[44:49] know that I am going. I'm doing this in
[44:51] the name of Jesus Christ. Lord, it would
[44:54] just help me so much because we're
[44:56] humans. We we don't understand.
[44:58] Sometimes we think we're right and we're
[44:59] wrong. Other times we think we're wrong
[45:01] and we're right. And it's just so hard
[45:04] sometimes to find the will of God, which
[45:06] is going to be my subject today. And I'm
[45:08] going to start on a series today on
[45:09] prayer. And as I was there praying, I
[45:12] said, 'Lord, it would just help me so
[45:14] much. This church came out of another
[45:18] church, very
[45:21] messagy
[45:23] uh church that that wasn't growing, that
[45:27] was just shrinking, that that the Lord
[45:28] wasn't moving. And then this church
[45:30] comes out and says, you know, we want to
[45:32] focus, we respect all of these things.
[45:34] We highly respect them, but we want to
[45:36] focus on Christ. So when they came out,
[45:39] started with just a two families, I
[45:41] think it was. Now they're over 60
[45:43] people. This is just like six months
[45:46] growing growing with other family
[45:49] members are coming in.
[45:51] And as I was about to go take the
[45:54] pulpit, I said, "Lord, please,
[45:57] I just need some confidence."
[46:00] And the pastor
[46:04] led in the song
[46:06] winds of faith
[46:10] as I was standing in the back and he
[46:12] said we'd like for brother Daniel to
[46:13] come up to this song and I came up to
[46:17] that song and that's why I asked Daniel
[46:18] to sing it before
[46:21] I came up
[46:24] and they finished the song and I said I
[46:26] was asking the Lord to show me to guide
[46:31] me. Am I in his will or am I not his in
[46:33] his will? And I said that song I said
[46:35] does anyone know the history of that
[46:37] song?
[46:39] None of them knew. I said that song was
[46:42] written by my song leader's dad. Not
[46:45] that one,
[46:47] the other song leader.
[46:50] That song was written by my song
[46:52] leader's dad.
[46:55] when
[46:56] he was coming out
[46:59] of the denominational Pentecostal church
[47:03] where they said that the evidence of the
[47:05] Holy Ghost is speaking in tongues. He
[47:07] was coming out of that. And I said, "And
[47:10] here you all are coming out and coming
[47:13] to Christ and you're singing that song
[47:16] and you had no idea where that song came
[47:18] from."
[47:20] And it hits right at home and I said now
[47:22] I know I can come in the name of Jesus
[47:25] Christ and minister to you that song.
[47:28] Let me There are two roads you may take.
[47:31] One by sight and one by faith. Take the
[47:35] word of God or what you see. What you
[47:41] believe is what will be.
[47:44] Do not struggle. It's by grace.
[47:49] Set your wings to the winds of faith.
[47:52] Can you imagine an eagle
[47:54] and the wind coming up under that
[47:56] eagle's wings? What's your need? What's
[48:00] your cry? What's your mountain much too
[48:03] high?
[48:05] Speak the word of God and by and by it
[48:09] will move or you will fly.
[48:14] That's so cool. There's a mountain
[48:15] there. It's like either the mountain
[48:17] will move or set your wings and you'll
[48:20] just fly right over it.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Watch the eagle in the sky. He does not
[48:25] struggle. He does not strive. For the
[48:28] power that makes him rise is already in
[48:32] the sky. That wind's already there. He's
[48:35] saying just spread your wings and fly
[48:37] above all these things. When you come
[48:40] out, friends, of that way of thinking,
[48:42] we call it a denominational spirit or or
[48:44] cutting other Christians out of the
[48:47] kingdom and you feel the love that was
[48:50] missing from your life, you never desire
[48:53] to go back to it. You feel the love, you
[48:56] feel acceptance, you feel liberty, you
[48:59] see new converts, you feel comfortable
[49:01] inviting your friends and your neighbors
[49:03] to church. And the reason is is because
[49:06] you feel now that Lord this is you. I
[49:10] can tell please I want everyone to come
[49:13] back to come to this. This Jesus Christ
[49:16] is real and don't try to go back to what
[49:22] we were.
[49:24] Don't do that. I think it was Einstein
[49:26] that says that said that the real
[49:30] evidence of insanity is doing the same
[49:33] thing over and over again and expecting
[49:35] that you're going to get a different
[49:36] outcome.
[49:38] And that's what many of of this is, is
[49:42] we expect that we're going to get a
[49:44] different result if we keep doing the
[49:46] same thing over and over again. And
[49:48] we're not learning that God is showing
[49:50] us that we need to get back to the
[49:53] Bible. Get back to the apostolic
[49:55] doctrine. Get turn our hearts back to
[49:59] this book, to this Bible. That is the
[50:02] word. And then God blesses it. God does
[50:07] wonderful things. I'll uh just want to
[50:11] give just a short.
[50:14] Maybe I'll I'll talk a little bit about
[50:16] it more tonight, but how important
[50:21] fellowship is. It's important to us.
[50:25] It's important to God.
[50:28] God wants fellowship. He wants
[50:31] fellowship with his children.
[50:34] The Bible
[50:37] has a purpose.
[50:39] And this purpose
[50:41] of this Bible, people try to make it a
[50:44] science book. They try to build an ark
[50:46] that's exactly the same size. And they
[50:48] try to make everything work. And they
[50:51] try to prove um when when Joshua said
[50:54] the sun stood still, they try to go back
[50:56] to the solar calendars and they and they
[50:58] try to prove that the earth was created
[51:00] in 6,000 years. It doesn't say 6,000
[51:02] years. It says six days, but then they
[51:04] take something in Peter and says it's
[51:06] like six like a thousand years and then
[51:08] they everybody tries to make it. The
[51:10] Bible was not written to be a science
[51:12] book. That wasn't the purpose that God
[51:14] had. If it was written to be a science
[51:17] book, then we would understand. We'd
[51:19] understand the big bang. We'd understand
[51:20] how the hydrogen atom turned into a
[51:22] helium atom and then the helium to
[51:24] nitrogen and it went all the way down
[51:25] through the periodic table and then
[51:27] there was a big bang. It all happened in
[51:28] a microcond. We'd all understand that.
[51:30] But that that's not what we need to
[51:32] understand.
[51:33] And neither is the Bible a history book.
[51:36] There's beautiful history in the Bible.
[51:40] But it wasn't written for that. All of
[51:43] the creation and all of the history and
[51:47] everything, all of the inspiration in
[51:49] the Bible was written for one purpose
[51:52] from Genesis to Revelation. And that
[51:54] this book is a book about a
[51:57] relationship.
[51:58] It's a book about a relationship between
[52:01] God
[52:03] and the individual from start to finish.
[52:07] It's about that. Let's read. Let's start
[52:10] right at the beginning and we'll see how
[52:13] far we get.
[52:15] Genesis chapter 1 verse one.
[52:26] When you read your Bible, friends,
[52:28] remember it's a gift. It's a gift from
[52:32] God to teach you more about him so that
[52:37] you might and I might approach him in
[52:40] the right way.
[52:42] In the beginning, God created the heaven
[52:44] and the earth.
[52:46] And the earth was without form and void,
[52:49] and darkness was upon the face of the
[52:51] deep. And the spirit of God moved upon
[52:55] the face of the waters.
[52:58] Before the spirit of God moved upon this
[53:01] vessel called the earth, it was void and
[53:03] without form. But when this spirit,
[53:06] which is the Holy Spirit, when this
[53:08] spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[53:11] deep is when God communed
[53:14] with the earth. When God spoke to the
[53:19] earth and then light came forth
[53:23] all the way back in the book of Genesis,
[53:26] we have no long we have no idea how long
[53:28] ago that this happened. It just said in
[53:31] the beginning that the spirit of God
[53:33] moved upon the face of the deep and upon
[53:35] the earth. But watch what happens when
[53:38] it does. And the same thing, God's
[53:41] spirit does not change. God said, "I am
[53:43] God and I change not." when his spirit
[53:47] moves across darkness,
[53:51] what happens?
[53:53] And God said, "Let there be light." And
[53:57] there was light.
[53:59] Where there was once darkness, once
[54:00] there was once confusion, God's spirit
[54:03] entered in and brought light. And it's
[54:05] the same. The age-old question is, "What
[54:07] is the meaning of life? Why am I here?"
[54:11] And when there is communion, when there
[54:14] is conversation between God and man,
[54:16] when the spirit of God moves across our
[54:19] lives, our paths are illuminated and we
[54:23] see that we were placed here on earth to
[54:26] make a difference.
[54:29] If we have the same spirit that moved
[54:32] across the face of the deep and brought
[54:34] light, then we can see that our purpose
[54:37] in life is to bring light to a dark
[54:41] world. What is the meaning of life? It's
[54:43] not to serve yourself. What is the
[54:45] meaning of life? It's not to get as much
[54:47] as you can. What is the meaning of life?
[54:48] It is to bring light to a dark world.
[54:53] and the darkness. Think of the darkness
[54:55] that was upon that poor sister and the
[54:58] depression and anxiety and the
[55:01] loneliness she had. But communion
[55:05] fellowship brought light to her life and
[55:10] she was so happy. I was like, "Man, this
[55:12] this sister's great." And she was just
[55:15] talking and and excited. And I had no
[55:17] idea that just a little while before she
[55:21] was in a deep dark depression. And it
[55:25] was just this pastor's mom reaching out
[55:28] to her and then bringing her in to this
[55:32] light of the gospel. And God saw the
[55:34] light that it was good. And God divided
[55:39] the light from the darkness. Notice he
[55:42] says that the light was good. But he
[55:45] doesn't say that about the darkness.
[55:48] And that's how the presence of God is,
[55:50] friends. Light separates itself from
[55:53] darkness. When you turn on a light,
[55:55] where does the darkness go? It just
[55:58] immediately is gone. And that's how it
[56:01] is. When the when the light of God
[56:03] really comes down, that joy enters in
[56:07] and there is no darkness. There is no
[56:09] depression. There is there are no
[56:11] problems. If we can just really get into
[56:14] his light, if we could just really enter
[56:18] in to that fellowship with God, then
[56:22] things would change. Things would change
[56:24] in our lives. Skip to verse 27.
[56:29] So God created man in his own image. In
[56:32] the image of God created he him. Male
[56:34] and female created he them. What does
[56:37] that mean?
[56:38] God created man in his own image. Said
[56:41] both girls and boys.
[56:44] There are certain traits in human beings
[56:47] that we have that are from God. That
[56:50] love that a father has for his children,
[56:54] that love that a husband has for his
[56:57] wife, we get that from God.
[57:01] I was made in God's own image. That's
[57:02] why I love my wife. That's why I love my
[57:04] children. That's God coming out in me.
[57:07] that that spirit of a of a mother and
[57:11] how that mother loves that baby and
[57:13] would give her life for that baby.
[57:16] There's the spirit of God coming out in
[57:18] that mother. That spirit of a wife
[57:21] loving her husband, taking care of her
[57:24] husband, supporting her husband. That's
[57:26] the spirit of God coming out. We were
[57:28] made in God's own image. And we were
[57:31] made for harmony. We were made for
[57:33] unity. And that's what he wanted in the
[57:35] beginning. I was on a trip, very strange
[57:39] story. I was on a trip to um somewhere I
[57:42] was going through Baltimore a few years
[57:45] ago and I was sitting on a plane and
[57:47] there was a guy over to my left over
[57:50] here and uh I just said a couple words
[57:54] to him and we get to Baltimore and I was
[57:56] I I was had a tight connection. So, I
[58:00] get off the plane and I go up and I'm
[58:02] looking at the kiosk and I'm making sure
[58:05] that I'm going to the right gate.
[58:07] I look there and and after I found it, I
[58:11] was like, "Okay, I'm at gate. I'm at
[58:12] this gate." And then I started to walk
[58:15] and there was that man that was sitting
[58:17] across the aisle from me and he was with
[58:18] two other men.
[58:20] And they said, "Can we talk to you for a
[58:22] minute?"
[58:24] And I was like, "Yeah, you know, that's
[58:26] sure. I have I have a few minutes." So I
[58:28] said, "I have a tight connection, but I
[58:29] have a few minutes." And they, it was
[58:31] the strangest thing. They said, "We have
[58:34] a word from the Lord for you."
[58:38] And
[58:41] they don't know who I am. They don't
[58:42] know anything about me. And I said,
[58:45] "Okay." And the man said, he says, "I
[58:49] see you in a ship."
[58:51] And he says, "You're steering the ship."
[58:55] And he said, "There's all of these
[58:57] people
[58:58] in the ship and he says
[59:02] it's fellowship.
[59:05] He says like fellows in the same ship.
[59:08] He says, "Does that mean anything to
[59:09] you?"
[59:12] And I said, "Yeah."
[59:17] And he said, "You're going to have a
[59:19] ministry
[59:21] that's going to promote fellowship."
[59:24] And I said, I said, "Thank you." I said,
[59:28] "I gotta go." And I said, "By the way,
[59:33] I'm already in the ministry." And
[59:35] they're like, "Whoa." I gotta go.
[59:39] So, I took off and and I and I I got my
[59:42] flight. But it's the spirit of God.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; God wants us to live in harmony with
[59:49] each other. He wants us to love one
[59:52] another. He wants us to support one
[59:54] another. We all come with our problems.
[59:56] Every single one of us comes into this
[59:58] building and we've all got issues. We've
[1:00:01] all got problems. But God wants us to
[1:00:05] take those problems and lay them on him.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; That's why I say come as you are into
[1:00:12] this church. Come whatever you are, come
[1:00:14] as you are, but don't stay as you are.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Come into I want this church. I want it
[1:00:19] full. I want it I want alcoholism here.
[1:00:21] I want tattoos here. I want I want all
[1:00:24] kinds of problems. I want them all here.
[1:00:26] And then when you leave, leave them
[1:00:28] here.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Don't take them with you. Drop them off.
[1:00:32] Leave them right here at this altar. And
[1:00:34] then you leave a renewed man, a renewed
[1:00:37] woman, someone that now has the joy of
[1:00:39] Jesus Christ that has replaced what you
[1:00:42] carried in sin before.
[1:00:45] I uh
[1:00:49] in John, one of the
[1:00:52] one of the things that I minister I talk
[1:00:54] about a lot and it's something that
[1:00:57] really hits people and they don't like
[1:01:01] it
[1:01:03] and I just keep on saying it because
[1:01:05] it's the words of the Lord Jesus and
[1:01:07] they they don't they can't understand
[1:01:09] it. They it because it doesn't match
[1:01:12] their way of thinking. So, we'll come up
[1:01:15] with an excuse why it isn't true. But
[1:01:18] listen to this. In John chapter 13,
[1:01:23] verse 34,
[1:01:26] it says this.
[1:01:33] It says, "A new commandment I give to
[1:01:35] you, and I'm laying a foundation, that
[1:01:36] you love one another as I've loved you.
[1:01:40] That you also love one another. By this
[1:01:42] all men, by this all will know that you
[1:01:44] are my disciples if you have love one
[1:01:47] for another. So Jesus's greatest desire
[1:01:50] was that we all be with him.
[1:01:53] That that that we all love one another.
[1:01:55] And then in John 17:24 it says this,
[1:01:57] "Father," as Jesus is praying, he says,
[1:01:59] "Father, I will also that they whom thou
[1:02:03] hast given me be with me where I am,
[1:02:05] that they may behold my glory which thou
[1:02:08] hast given me, for thou lovest me before
[1:02:10] the foundation of the world." So Jesus
[1:02:12] was there praying in the garden of
[1:02:13] Gethsemane and he was about to die and
[1:02:16] rise again and incend ascend to heaven
[1:02:18] and he did not want to be alone.
[1:02:22] Jesus didn't. He wanted fellowship. He
[1:02:26] wanted his his disciples to be there. He
[1:02:29] wanted his friends to be there. He
[1:02:31] wanted us to be there with him. He could
[1:02:34] die, give his give his life for all
[1:02:37] humanity. But his prayer was like,
[1:02:40] "Lord, I want him with me.
[1:02:43] I want them to be with me. I want them
[1:02:45] to fellowship with me."
[1:02:48] And
[1:02:50] I think I skipped a scripture here.
[1:02:53] There's a place,
[1:02:58] one of the
[1:03:00] the criticisms I get is I I preach where
[1:03:04] I believe it's John chapter 10 where
[1:03:05] Jesus said he said that there will be
[1:03:07] one shepherd onefold.
[1:03:11] And there's always an excuse why that we
[1:03:14] don't have to all be one. We don't have
[1:03:15] to all be together. We and we should
[1:03:18] have different churches and and there's
[1:03:19] slightly different doctrines and that's
[1:03:21] fine. But we should all love one another
[1:03:23] as ourselves and not set one group above
[1:03:26] another. And when you when you try to
[1:03:28] set one group another over another, you
[1:03:31] say, "No, I have a different shepherd
[1:03:32] than Jesus." They have they have a
[1:03:34] different Jesus than I have. We have the
[1:03:37] same Jesus. Friends,
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; we have the same Jesus. Whether you're
[1:03:41] here or whether you're at Calvary
[1:03:43] Chapel, whether you're at Zion City,
[1:03:45] whether you're at the Baptist church
[1:03:46] down the road, we have the same God. And
[1:03:49] do you think Christ looking down at his
[1:03:52] children, do you think it pleases him to
[1:03:54] have them at odds with each other? It
[1:03:56] doesn't. I'll tell you that right now.
[1:03:58] It doesn't.
[1:04:00] Every prayer that he prayed,
[1:04:02] he was always about for his people. He
[1:04:06] wanted them to be together. He wanted
[1:04:08] them to have love for each other.
[1:04:11] Let's go back to Genesis.
[1:04:20] Verse number 27, chapter 1 verse 27. It
[1:04:22] says this. So God created man in his own
[1:04:24] image. In the image of God created he
[1:04:26] him. Male and female created he them.
[1:04:29] Now God has his children on earth. He's
[1:04:33] got him in the garden of Eden. He
[1:04:35] created the garden for them to live live
[1:04:36] in. He separated the light from the
[1:04:38] darkness. He made the sun and the moon
[1:04:40] and he made the trees and the plants and
[1:04:41] he made the animals and it was all for
[1:04:43] his children. And most of all, most
[1:04:46] important of everything is God the
[1:04:48] Father was with his babies was with his
[1:04:52] children. That was the desire of God's
[1:04:55] heart to be with his children. They
[1:04:58] could speak directly to him and he could
[1:05:01] speak directly to them. Can you imagine
[1:05:04] what that would be?
[1:05:06] Can you imagine if if you're you're
[1:05:09] standing there and then you maybe feel
[1:05:14] something. Maybe you hear, "Oh, he's
[1:05:18] coming.
[1:05:19] He's going to be here." And just think,
[1:05:22] the mighty God, the creator of all the
[1:05:25] world, the creator of everything, he is
[1:05:28] walking through the garden and
[1:05:30] fellowshipping with his children. Can
[1:05:32] you imagine if we have that fellowship?
[1:05:36] Could you imagine? Seriously, if you had
[1:05:37] that, if you could just talk to God, if
[1:05:40] you were if you were in your room
[1:05:42] praying and he would just come down and
[1:05:44] say, "Sweetheart, I love you." Say,
[1:05:47] "Son, I'm proud of you."
[1:05:50] But we separate ourselves from God with
[1:05:52] sin.
[1:05:55] And that's what they did in the Garden
[1:05:56] of Eden. They chose sin
[1:06:00] over fellowship with God. And from that
[1:06:03] point, it has been God's greatest desire
[1:06:05] to get back to that fellowship.
[1:06:09] And yet, mankind runs away from it.
[1:06:13] Mankind doesn't really, it's not really
[1:06:16] important if we have that fellowship
[1:06:18] with God. We want it when we need it,
[1:06:22] but what about every day? What about
[1:06:24] living in the garden
[1:06:28] and God our father
[1:06:31] walking through?
[1:06:33] I mean the thought is even beyond my
[1:06:37] thinking
[1:06:39] but it could be. And even now when we go
[1:06:44] to prayer
[1:06:46] when we really get down we have the
[1:06:50] opportunity to speak to that one that
[1:06:55] was in the Garden of Eden. We have the
[1:06:57] opportunity to talk to him. We have the
[1:06:59] opportunity to fellowship with him.
[1:07:03] It's the greatest thing in the world.
[1:07:04] And then we say, "Oh, I'll give the Lord
[1:07:06] 30 minutes in the morning." Oh, I forgot
[1:07:08] to pray.
[1:07:10] How could we ever forget to pray? How
[1:07:13] could we ever ever just not desire to be
[1:07:17] around him? I've said many times that
[1:07:19] the more you pray, the more you will
[1:07:21] want to pray. And the less that you
[1:07:23] pray, the harder it is to pray. It's
[1:07:26] because you, like Adam and Eve and I, we
[1:07:28] separate ourselves from God, doing our
[1:07:31] own things. And then we try to get into
[1:07:33] his presence. And it takes time to get
[1:07:34] into his presence.
[1:07:37] It's the greatest thing in the world to
[1:07:38] be in the presence of God.
[1:07:41] And we have that opportunity for that
[1:07:43] fellowship. And God wants, if you don't
[1:07:46] get anything else from this sermon, get
[1:07:49] this. God wants our fellowship with us
[1:07:54] more than we want it with him.
[1:07:58] He wants to talk to his sons and
[1:08:01] daughters
[1:08:03] and we are the ones that don't want him.
[1:08:07] He wants it. He created that everything
[1:08:09] for us. He even told us and he says this
[1:08:12] is yours. He gave everything
[1:08:15] to Adam and Eve. He gave everything to
[1:08:17] his children. He says here it's yours
[1:08:21] and he wants us to be happy. He wants us
[1:08:24] to be with him. and we say, "I'm busy. I
[1:08:29] got too much going on." Can you imagine
[1:08:31] really coming into into his presence?
[1:08:34] And that's why it's so hard to
[1:08:37] Revelation chapter 21. I'll read the New
[1:08:39] King James Version. It says this.
[1:08:42] Revelation 21:1.
[1:08:46] This is where it's going. It started in
[1:08:48] in the Garden of Eden. And look at where
[1:08:51] it's going to be end up. Now I saw a new
[1:08:55] heaven and a new earth. For the first
[1:08:58] heaven and the first earth had passed
[1:08:59] away. Also there was no more sea. Then I
[1:09:02] John saw the holy city, the new
[1:09:04] Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from
[1:09:07] God prepared as a bride adorned for her
[1:09:10] husband. Who created this city and why?
[1:09:15] Jesus said, "I go and prepare a place
[1:09:17] for you." Not a place for him, for us.
[1:09:23] Look at the love that he has for us.
[1:09:26] The we stick our hand in his face so
[1:09:29] often, but yet he just keeps coming back
[1:09:32] with that love and he keeps saying just
[1:09:34] son, daughter, if you would just give me
[1:09:37] a little bit of your time. Revelation
[1:09:40] chapter 3, it says, "Behold, I stand at
[1:09:42] the door and knock." And then he says
[1:09:44] this, "And if anyone
[1:09:47] will open the door, I will come in and s
[1:09:51] with him." Can you imagine that lady in
[1:09:52] that church?
[1:09:55] She was there by herself. Nobody invited
[1:09:57] her. And there's Jesus. And he's the
[1:10:00] same way. If you will just if you'll
[1:10:03] just open your heart to me, if you'll
[1:10:05] just get on your knees, if you will just
[1:10:07] pray for a little while, then I will
[1:10:09] come in and I will suck with you. And
[1:10:10] the more that you open the door, the
[1:10:12] more that you give to me, I will give
[1:10:14] you more and more and more. I want it,
[1:10:17] but my people don't want it. Also,
[1:10:22] there was no more sea. Then I, John, saw
[1:10:26] the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming
[1:10:28] down out of heaven from God, prepared as
[1:10:30] a bride adorned for her husband. And I
[1:10:32] heard a loud voice from heaven saying,
[1:10:34] "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with
[1:10:37] men. He will dwell with them, and they
[1:10:40] shall be his and they shall be his
[1:10:42] people. God himself will be with them
[1:10:45] and be their God."
[1:10:49] Many what do we have to look forward to?
[1:10:52] He will be there
[1:10:55] and God will wipe away every tear from
[1:10:57] their eyes and there shall be no more
[1:10:59] death nor sorrow nor crying. There shall
[1:11:02] be no more pain for the former things
[1:11:04] have passed away. Then he who sat on the
[1:11:07] throne said, "Behold, I make all things
[1:11:10] new."
[1:11:12] And he said to me, "Write, for these
[1:11:14] words are true and faithful."
[1:11:17] When you get into the presence of God,
[1:11:20] behold, I make all things new. Jesus
[1:11:22] doesn't change. He's the same yesterday
[1:11:25] and today and forever. If he could
[1:11:28] change Mary Magdalene, the sinner, then
[1:11:30] he can change a sinner now and make them
[1:11:34] new. And he said, "I make things new.
[1:11:38] Everything that you've done, it's okay.
[1:11:39] Just come to me, son. Just come to me,
[1:11:41] daughter. I'll change it all. Just give
[1:11:43] it to me. I just want to talk with you.
[1:11:47] I just want to fellowship with you. I
[1:11:49] just want you to be happy. I just want
[1:11:50] you to to succeed. I just want to be
[1:11:53] part of your life.
[1:11:55] Don't take anything else than than what
[1:11:57] I'm giving you.
[1:12:00] Back to Genesis 1, verse number 28,
[1:12:05] talking about Adam and Eve. It says,
[1:12:08] "And God blessed them. And God said unto
[1:12:11] them, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and
[1:12:12] replenish the earth, and subdue it, and
[1:12:14] have dominion over the fish in the sea,
[1:12:16] and over the fowl of the air, and over
[1:12:18] every living thing that moveth upon the
[1:12:19] earth. It's all yours, children.
[1:12:22] It's all yours. I love you, and you love
[1:12:25] me." Look at this relationship between
[1:12:27] God and his children. And that's what he
[1:12:29] wants. That's what he wants with us.
[1:12:31] Now,
[1:12:32] and God said, "Behold, I have given you
[1:12:34] every tree. I've given you. I didn't
[1:12:36] create it for myself. I have given you
[1:12:40] every herb bearing seed which is upon
[1:12:42] the face of all the earth and every tree
[1:12:44] in that in the which is the fruit of a
[1:12:47] tree yielding seed to you it shall be
[1:12:51] for meat for food. So they were eating
[1:12:54] the plants in the garden of Eden and
[1:12:56] they were happy.
[1:12:59] And to every beast of the earth, and
[1:13:00] every fowl of the air, and everything
[1:13:01] that creepeth upon the earth, wherein
[1:13:03] there is life, I have given every green
[1:13:05] herb for me to. And it was so. And God
[1:13:10] saw everything that he made. And behold,
[1:13:13] it was very good.
[1:13:15] And the evening and the morning were the
[1:13:17] sixth day. He had just gone through
[1:13:19] these six days
[1:13:23] for a purpose. And what was that
[1:13:26] purpose?
[1:13:27] That purpose was for his children.
[1:13:31] Do you see the nature of God? Do you see
[1:13:33] what he wants for us? When we separate
[1:13:36] from God, we are the ones that bring the
[1:13:39] suffering on ourselves. And God doesn't
[1:13:40] want it.
[1:13:42] God wants to bless us. He wants his
[1:13:46] greatest desire, as I said, it's
[1:13:49] communion.
[1:13:51] It is fellowship with his children. He
[1:13:54] wants to be with us.
[1:14:00] I just remember John. It was in John
[1:14:02] chapter 10. It's in my notes here. Verse
[1:14:06] number nine. Let's just read it. John 10
[1:14:08] verse1 17
[1:14:10] verse 14.
[1:14:14] Again, this is the one that people just
[1:14:16] can't get through their minds.
[1:14:18] And it's always an excuse why we don't
[1:14:20] have to be one. I I was talking to a a
[1:14:22] brother a couple years ago
[1:14:26] and I was telling I said, "We need
[1:14:27] Christ. We this this is a failed
[1:14:30] concept. We need Jesus. We need the Lord
[1:14:33] in the church. We need the Holy Spirit
[1:14:34] in the church and not all these weird
[1:14:36] doctrines that just separate us." And
[1:14:38] then he tells me, he says, "Well, what
[1:14:40] separates us from the Baptist church
[1:14:41] across the street?" My answer, "Why do
[1:14:44] you want to be separated?"
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; What a novel concept. What a strange
[1:14:49] thought.
[1:14:50] Why would you want to be separated?
[1:14:54] Verse number 14. I am the good shepherd
[1:14:56] and know and know my sheep and am known
[1:14:59] of mine.
[1:15:01] As the father knoweth me, even so I know
[1:15:03] the father. I lay down my life for the
[1:15:05] sheep.
[1:15:07] And other sheep I have which are not of
[1:15:10] this fold.
[1:15:13] Them also I must bring, and they shall
[1:15:15] hear my voice.
[1:15:18] And there shall be one fold and one
[1:15:19] shepherd.
[1:15:21] If one group of Christians from all
[1:15:23] walks of life
[1:15:27] in the shepherd in the fold Christians
[1:15:30] loving the Lord accepting Jesus Christ
[1:15:33] as their savior. Therefore doth my
[1:15:35] father love me because I laid down my
[1:15:38] life that I might take it up again. And
[1:15:40] he did lay down his life on the cross
[1:15:44] and he took up his life from the tomb.
[1:15:46] Therefore doth my father love me because
[1:15:49] I lay down my life that I might take it
[1:15:50] again. No man taketh it from me but I
[1:15:53] lay it down myself. I have the power to
[1:15:55] lay it down and I have the power to take
[1:15:57] it up again. This commandment have I
[1:15:58] received of the father.
[1:16:01] I lay down my life for you. Look at what
[1:16:04] look at the spirit of God. It's all
[1:16:06] through the Bible. Friends he's saying
[1:16:08] he said son daughter I give my life for
[1:16:11] you. Brother um Thaddius Burgess,
[1:16:15] he preached our camps the past two
[1:16:17] years. He said something during one of
[1:16:21] those camps that I will never forget and
[1:16:25] it stuck down in me and and it helped me
[1:16:30] understand this sacrifice of Jesus
[1:16:32] Christ. He said, "When I make a
[1:16:35] purchase, when I buy something, when I
[1:16:38] go to the store and I buy whatever it
[1:16:43] might be and it costs $5,
[1:16:46] this
[1:16:48] is worth more to me than my $5. So, I
[1:16:52] give my $5 for this." Just simple
[1:16:58] buying stuff.
[1:17:00] Now, look at what meant the most to God.
[1:17:02] John chapter 3:14, and we'll close with
[1:17:05] this.
[1:17:07] As Moses lifted up the serpent in the
[1:17:10] wilderness, even so must the Son of Man
[1:17:13] be lifted up. What does that mean? As
[1:17:16] Moses lifted up the serpent in the
[1:17:17] wilderness, even so must the Son of Man
[1:17:19] be lifted up. Moses built this this
[1:17:22] snake around this pole out of bronze and
[1:17:25] he set it up in front of the in front of
[1:17:27] the people when they were wandering in
[1:17:29] the wilderness and they when they would
[1:17:31] get bitten by snakes, there's these
[1:17:32] these deadly snakes all over the place.
[1:17:36] When they would get bitten by the snake,
[1:17:39] if they would just look at this brass
[1:17:40] serpent on this pole, then they had a
[1:17:42] promise to be healed.
[1:17:44] And he's saying here that as this brass,
[1:17:48] this bronze serpent was lifted up in the
[1:17:50] wilderness
[1:17:51] and the people looked on it, Christ was
[1:17:54] the same. My grandfather,
[1:17:57] he was fishing with brother Brandham
[1:18:00] and he was bitten by a rattlesnake.
[1:18:04] Top of his foot, the pain,
[1:18:06] the burning was there. And brother
[1:18:09] Brandham went over to my grandfather. He
[1:18:11] laid his hand on him and he pointed my
[1:18:14] grandpa to that shed blood. He pointed
[1:18:17] my grandpa to Jesus Christ and he
[1:18:19] said,"Lord, it is written in your word
[1:18:22] that they shall tread on serpents and
[1:18:24] scorpions and nothing by any means will
[1:18:26] harm them." And immediately he was
[1:18:28] healed exactly like they were healed in
[1:18:30] the wilderness with Moses pointing
[1:18:34] people to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:18:38] It says here,
[1:18:42] "And whosoever believeth in him
[1:18:45] should not perish, but have eternal
[1:18:46] life." Let me read that again. John
[1:18:48] 3:14. And as Moses lifted up the serpent
[1:18:50] in the wilderness, even so must the Son
[1:18:52] of Man be lifted up. Moses set up the
[1:18:54] serpent in the wilderness, the Lord
[1:18:57] Jesus Christ was set up on the cross.
[1:19:02] Even so must the Son of Man be lifted up
[1:19:04] that whosoever believeth in him should
[1:19:06] not perish but have eternal life.
[1:19:10] For God so loved the world.
[1:19:15] Remember how much it costs.
[1:19:19] What was worth more to God? My soul or
[1:19:22] his son?
[1:19:24] He paid.
[1:19:26] He paid the price for me.
[1:19:29] This I know it's the most famous
[1:19:31] scripture in the whole Bible. But do we
[1:19:33] really understand it? For God so loved
[1:19:35] the world that he gave his only begotten
[1:19:38] son that whosoever believeth him should
[1:19:40] not perish but have everlasting life.
[1:19:43] God wanted to save us so much that he
[1:19:46] gave his son on the cross to die as a
[1:19:48] sacrifice
[1:19:49] as an atonement for my sins that I might
[1:19:51] go to heaven.
[1:19:53] Brother Thaddius when he said that
[1:19:57] really made it click.
[1:20:00] I was worth so much
[1:20:03] to God. And you were worth so much to
[1:20:05] God that he gave his son
[1:20:08] that I might be saved, that I might have
[1:20:10] eternal life. For God sent not his son
[1:20:12] into the world to condemn the world, but
[1:20:14] that the world through him might be
[1:20:17] saved. Everyone wants to condemn the
[1:20:18] sinner. They want to condemn the
[1:20:20] homosexual. They want to condemn the
[1:20:22] alcoholic. They want to condemn the
[1:20:23] Catholic. They want to condemn every
[1:20:25] person, but except for the person that's
[1:20:27] doing the con the condemning. They don't
[1:20:29] want to be condemned. But it says right
[1:20:31] here that Jesus came not to condemn, but
[1:20:34] to save those people, those very people
[1:20:36] that we might look down on. He believed.
[1:20:39] He that believeth on him is not
[1:20:41] condemned, but he that believeth not is
[1:20:43] condemned already because he has not
[1:20:45] believed in the name of the only
[1:20:48] begotten son of God.
[1:20:51] One shepherd, one fold, one Christ, one
[1:20:55] name, one man, the man Christ Jesus.
[1:21:00] But why is it so hard for us to accept?
[1:21:04] What is the simple fact that Jesus
[1:21:06] Christ died for the sins of the world?
[1:21:08] Why is that so hard for the world to
[1:21:12] accept? It's the same reason
[1:21:16] our minds just get clouded. Remember,
[1:21:18] the greatest battle ever fought right
[1:21:20] here.
[1:21:21] And it's so hard for us to see that it's
[1:21:24] that simple that Jesus Christ died for
[1:21:27] my sins. And I have the opportunity, if
[1:21:30] I would just give him the time, I have
[1:21:32] the opportunity to go before him in the
[1:21:35] name of the son of God and speak to the
[1:21:38] one that created me. Speak to the one
[1:21:41] that created the heavens and the earth.
[1:21:43] The one that has all power. And I have
[1:21:45] the opportunity to speak to him.
[1:21:50] when we pray. It's that simple. We want
[1:21:53] to make it too complicated, but it is
[1:21:55] that simple. Daniel, you and the the
[1:21:57] team can come.
[1:22:01] Now, listen to this. I said John 3 3:18.
[1:22:05] He that believeth on him is not
[1:22:07] condemned, but he that believeth not is
[1:22:08] condemned already because he hath not
[1:22:11] believed in the name of the only
[1:22:12] begotten son of God. As I said, one
[1:22:15] shepherd, one fold, one Christ, one man.
[1:22:20] But what does it produce, next verse,
[1:22:24] there was division, therefore again
[1:22:26] among the Jews for those sayings? So
[1:22:29] hard. It was so hard to accept the fact
[1:22:32] that I can just get on my knees and go
[1:22:35] to the Lord. It was so hard for them to
[1:22:37] accept that someone else could die for
[1:22:39] my sins. It was so hard for them to just
[1:22:43] say they were wrong.
[1:22:45] But it's that simple. And then we have
[1:22:48] the opportunity
[1:22:51] to go before the Lord in prayer and
[1:22:55] speak to that one.
[1:22:58] I had a dentist appointment not too long
[1:23:00] ago and the hygienist was talking about
[1:23:02] flossing
[1:23:05] and she said that she flosses every day
[1:23:10] and she said that
[1:23:13] if she doesn't have she runs out of
[1:23:14] floss or something and she's not able to
[1:23:16] floss,
[1:23:18] she said it starts making her nervous
[1:23:21] because she can feel the grime start to
[1:23:24] form on her teeth. And I was thinking, I
[1:23:27] don't feel that
[1:23:32] because I don't floss like that. But she
[1:23:35] said that she would start to feel the
[1:23:38] grime and she she would be looking for a
[1:23:40] thread
[1:23:42] and her clothes so she could floss and
[1:23:45] get that grime out from between her
[1:23:47] teeth. And that's how it is when we
[1:23:48] pray, friends. we get down and the more
[1:23:51] we pray, the more we can get rid of that
[1:23:54] grime and and and go before the Lord and
[1:23:56] just pour it all out and then get up new
[1:23:59] people praising God and happy and giving
[1:24:02] our lives to the Lord and and
[1:24:04] introducing other people and let the
[1:24:05] light shine forth. But when we neglect
[1:24:09] praying, we don't see the grime that
[1:24:12] starts to form
[1:24:15] and it hinders our our walk with God.
[1:24:18] And not only does it hinder our walk
[1:24:20] with God, it hinders
[1:24:24] our spouse's walk with God. It hinders
[1:24:26] our children's walk with God. It hinders
[1:24:30] other people because we can be that
[1:24:32] light. Jesus said, he said, "You're the
[1:24:34] light of the world, brother Joe." He
[1:24:36] said, "You are the light of the world."
[1:24:39] So he dies and he goes up to heaven.
[1:24:42] dies and resurrects and goes up to
[1:24:44] heaven and then he lays his holy spirit
[1:24:47] down upon us and he says now you go,
[1:24:51] you do the same. The one that I see in
[1:24:54] the Bible that prayed the most
[1:24:58] was Jesus Christ. Can you imagine?
[1:25:03] He's constantly praying. He's constantly
[1:25:05] getting away. He's constantly going
[1:25:08] before the father. And if he did it,
[1:25:11] friends, we should do it that just that
[1:25:13] much more. Amen. God bless you, Daniel.
[1:25:18] [Music]
[1:25:22] I'm living
[1:25:24] proof
[1:25:28] of what the mercy
[1:25:30] of God can do.
[1:25:36] If you knew me then, you'd believe me
[1:25:39] now.
[1:25:41] He turned my whole life upside down.
[1:25:45] Took the old and he made it new.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, think about it.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; That's what the mercy
[1:25:56] of God can do.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; I'm alive to tell the story.
[1:26:06] of how I've overcome
[1:26:10] with his goodness and mercy
[1:26:14] in the power of the blood. And I'm so
[1:26:18] glad that my freedom
[1:26:22] wasn't based on what I've done
[1:26:25] with his goodness and mercy
[1:26:29] in the power of the blood.
[1:26:33] [Music]
[1:26:36] I thought I
[1:26:39] deserve
[1:26:42] oh to be six feet beneath
[1:26:47] the earth.
[1:26:51] For the things I've done, the things
[1:26:54] I've said, the choices made that I
[1:26:58] regret.
[1:27:00] Oh, I would still be long
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; for the mercy of God.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; But for the mercy
[1:27:10] of God,
[1:27:12] [Music]
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; I'm alive to tell the story
[1:27:17] of how I've overcome
[1:27:21] with his goodness and mercy
[1:27:25] and the power of the blood. And I'm so
[1:27:29] glad that my freedom
[1:27:32] wasn't based on what I've done.
[1:27:36] But it's goodness,
[1:27:38] you see, in the power of
[1:27:45] death.
[1:27:48] And was the cross made for me that my
[1:27:53] savior
[1:27:55] carried?
[1:27:57] Oh, I've been made free by the mercy
[1:28:02] of God. It was a grave meant for me.
[1:28:08] Where my sin laid buried, now I stand
[1:28:14] redeemed by the mercy
[1:28:18] of God. It was the cross made for me
[1:28:23] that my savior
[1:28:26] carried.
[1:28:28] Oh, I've been made free by the mercy
[1:28:33] of God. It was the grave meant for me
[1:28:38] where my sin lay buried. Now I stand
[1:28:44] redeemed by the mercy
[1:28:48] of God.
[1:28:51] Now I'm alive to tell the story
[1:28:55] of how I've overcome
[1:28:59] by his goodness and mercy
[1:29:03] and the power of his blood. And I'm so
[1:29:07] glad that my freedom
[1:29:11] wasn't based on what I've done,
[1:29:15] but his goodness and mercy
[1:29:19] in the power of the blood.
[1:29:24] What words? What words? You know, these
[1:29:28] songs that we sing, we sing them, but
[1:29:30] sometimes we should just stop and
[1:29:32] consider these words.
[1:29:35] Joy is the Lord working on your heart.
[1:29:38] [Music]
[1:29:40] Do you want to be baptized, sister?
[1:29:43] [Music]
[1:29:51] It's up to you.
[1:29:55] Feel good about it,
[1:30:00] sister. The Lord Jesus is real
[1:30:03] and he's mighty. And let me tell you
[1:30:06] something,
[1:30:09] sister. He knows you. He knows your
[1:30:13] name.
[1:30:15] And he cares.
[1:30:18] He loves you.
[1:30:20] He loves me, too.
[1:30:24] Sister Elizabeth, where are you at?
[1:30:27] Could you come in the back? Sister Joy,
[1:30:29] if you want to be baptized,
[1:30:32] being baptized represents
[1:30:35] going into the grave,
[1:30:37] [Music]
[1:30:39] taking on the name of Jesus Christ
[1:30:43] and making a commitment that I'm going
[1:30:45] to live a different life.
[1:30:47] Tears just coming out of your heart,
[1:30:49] sister, the Lord's dealing with you.
[1:30:52] If you want to be baptized, you can go
[1:30:54] and meet Elizabeth there in the back,
[1:30:56] and she'll take you up there and talk to
[1:30:57] you.
[1:30:58] [Music]
[1:31:04] Friends, God is real.
[1:31:06] [Music]
[1:31:09] [Applause]
[1:31:12] [Music]
[1:31:12] [Applause]
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; We have water in the baptismal, I
[1:31:16] assume.
[1:31:19] I hope so.
[1:31:24] Jesus is real, friends. He loves us. He
[1:31:28] cares. That's what's different about him
[1:31:30] than everybody else. Even a mother, even
[1:31:34] a mother
[1:31:37] could lose compassion for her child. But
[1:31:39] Jesus never will. No matter what I do,
[1:31:43] no matter what sin I commit, no matter
[1:31:45] how far I go, Jesus Christ is always
[1:31:49] there with open arms, waiting for me to
[1:31:52] come back. And he leaves it up to me.
[1:31:57] and he leaves it up to you.
[1:32:00] Give him time.
[1:32:03] Give him your time. Give him your love.
[1:32:07] Just tell him sometimes. Just stop and
[1:32:09] say, "Jesus, I love you.
[1:32:14] You're great.
[1:32:16] I look forward to that day that I can be
[1:32:18] like Adam and Eve in the garden where
[1:32:21] the mighty God will just walk by.
[1:32:25] Maybe we'll all be there.
[1:32:28] Can you imagine Zyra just being there
[1:32:31] and having God the Almighty walk by be
[1:32:34] like whoa.
[1:32:37] Bible says there are 100 million angels
[1:32:40] surrounding him singing holy, holy unto
[1:32:42] the Lord.
[1:32:44] the 24 elders, the four beasts, the
[1:32:48] great power is surrounding him all the
[1:32:51] time. And they're just watching him in
[1:32:54] awe and they're saying, "Holy, holy,
[1:32:57] holy unto the Lord, looking at the lamb
[1:33:00] of God, Jesus Christ, and that is the
[1:33:03] one that wants to talk to me.
[1:33:06] That's the one that wants to talk to
[1:33:07] you.
[1:33:09] You feel good?"

[1:39:03] Sister Joy,
[1:39:06] some of us know Joy and she just told
[1:39:10] me, she said, "It's time for me to put
[1:39:13] it all to rest."
[1:39:16] You know what Jesus said? Come unto me
[1:39:19] all you that labor and are heavy laden,
[1:39:21] and I will give you rest. Come on. Come
[1:39:25] on down, Joy. God bless you. That's
[1:39:27] Jesus. He loves us. He He cares about
[1:39:31] us.
[1:39:32] And as I said, he wants to talk with us
[1:39:35] more than we want to talk with him.
[1:39:37] Joey, come on right here.
[1:39:41] As I told you, very, very proud of you.
[1:39:46] I just told the congregation you just
[1:39:48] what you just told me. I just want to
[1:39:51] It's just time for me to put it to rest.
[1:39:54] You feel good? Bless. Bless your heart.
[1:39:57] I can see just the sincerity in her and
[1:40:01] the the eyes that are just you can't
[1:40:04] hide your eyes and how that the Lord's
[1:40:08] just dealing with you. And I saw you out
[1:40:09] there and I could see him working on
[1:40:11] you. And now this is the decision that
[1:40:16] you're making that you from this day
[1:40:21] have given your life to Jesus Christ and
[1:40:24] you are becoming a Christian.
[1:40:26] Is that your desire?
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Well, doesn't take any more than that.
[1:40:39] When I baptize you, baptize you in the
[1:40:42] name of Jesus Christ. Not baptize you
[1:40:45] into this church. Not baptize you into
[1:40:48] any other body. Body of Jesus Christ.
[1:40:52] You are taking on his name as a
[1:40:54] Christian.
[1:40:58] Grab my hand right here. I'm gonna put
[1:41:01] you under the water. Put the other hand
[1:41:04] put one hand across your chest right
[1:41:05] here.
[1:41:10] Joy by your own confession.
[1:41:14] I baptize you in the name of the Lord
[1:41:16] Jesus Christ.
[1:41:20] [Applause]
[1:41:33] Now we have somebody else. When I call
[1:41:36] for baptism, I saw this little guy jump
[1:41:38] up and take off over here. The Lord's
[1:41:41] been dealing with him. Sister Mercy, is
[1:41:43] he with you?
[1:41:44] And and you you witness to the young
[1:41:46] boy.
[1:41:48] Yeah. Come on in.
[1:41:52] Now hopefully you can swim.
[1:41:56] Yeah, look at you. You You've got your
[1:41:58] head above water. No, don't swim yet.
[1:42:02] Praise God. Ain't it good for the little
[1:42:04] ones?
[1:42:06] I haven't baptized many little ones in
[1:42:08] our church. We're I don't know 70 or 80
[1:42:10] people and they're mostly adults. So, it
[1:42:12] just does my heart good to see this
[1:42:14] little guy come to the Lord. Buddy,
[1:42:15] what's your name?
[1:42:23] He forgot.
[1:42:26] He's got a good name. The last prophet
[1:42:30] in the Bible
[1:42:32] was named Malachi. And this young man,
[1:42:35] his name is Malachi. And he said, "The
[1:42:36] Lord," I was just talking to him over
[1:42:38] here. He said he wants to give his heart
[1:42:40] to the Lord Jesus. And this is the way
[1:42:43] to do it.
[1:42:47] I wish I would have given my heart to
[1:42:50] the Lord Jesus at this age. I'd have
[1:42:52] made it a lot easier on myself and a lot
[1:42:55] easier on my mom and a lot easier on the
[1:42:57] Lord if I would have just done it like
[1:43:00] this young man's doing it.
[1:43:05] You understand?
[1:43:07] You're being baptized.
[1:43:08] You're being put down in this water
[1:43:12] to be a Christian
[1:43:14] to worship Jesus to give your heart to
[1:43:17] Jesus.
[1:43:19] And you're going to you're going to be a
[1:43:21] boy that loves God. Right. Sure.
[1:43:27] Hand right here. This way. Look at me.
[1:43:37] Malachi, by your own confession, I
[1:43:40] baptize you in the name of the Lord
[1:43:42] Jesus Christ.
[1:43:44] [Applause]
[1:43:50] [Applause]
[1:43:57] I feel good. Let's all stand.
[1:44:01] Friends, remember as I said, Jesus
[1:44:04] Christ loves us. Jesus Christ wants to
[1:44:08] talk with us more than we want to talk
[1:44:09] to him. He wants us to come to these
[1:44:11] waters of ba of baptism more than we
[1:44:13] want to come.
[1:44:15] And remember that right at the end of
[1:44:17] the book, there's a prayer
[1:44:21] going on at the end of the book of
[1:44:24] Revelation.
[1:44:26] And the spirit
[1:44:28] of God, the same one that moved across
[1:44:31] the face of the deep, the spirit and the
[1:44:36] bride
[1:44:37] are crying out, "Lord, come." And that's
[1:44:42] the feeling in our heart. Amen. God
[1:44:45] bless you, brothers and sisters. I pray
[1:44:47] that the Lord will be with you. Brother
[1:44:49] Ron Glidewell, would you mind coming and
[1:44:52] closing in prayer? God, God bless you
[1:44:55] all. Tonight, we have a we're going to
[1:44:56] have a prayer service. I'll say a few
[1:44:58] words, as I said, and then we'll get
[1:45:01] quiet and go before the Lord in prayer.
[1:45:03] God bless you.
[1:45:07] When peace like a river
[1:45:14] attendeth
[1:45:18] my way.
[1:45:22] When sorrows
[1:45:25] like seas
[1:45:27] billows
[1:45:29] roll.
[1:45:34] [Music]

[1:46:31] these two souls that you've drawn unto
[1:46:34] yourself and they've obeyed your
[1:46:36] command.
[1:46:38] We pray now, Lord, that you would
[1:46:40] continue to be with these two, that you
[1:46:43] would fill them with your Holy Spirit
[1:46:44] and teach them, reveal yourself unto
[1:46:47] them as we and we'll watch them grow,
[1:46:49] Father, and change into beautiful sons
[1:46:52] and daughters of God.
[1:46:54] We thank you for this day you've given
[1:46:56] us, for the opportunity,
[1:46:59] Lord, that we can come and worship in
[1:47:02] your name and believe you've been here
[1:47:04] with us. We pray now you continue to be
[1:47:07] with each and everyone the rest of this
[1:47:10] day. Bring us back tonight, Father. We
[1:47:14] pray that you would just continue
[1:47:15] speaking to each and every heart as we
[1:47:17] go. In the name of the Lord Jesus, we
[1:47:20] pray. Amen.

[1:48:05] and has shed
[1:48:08] his own blood
[1:48:11] for my soul.

[1:51:29] kids. Let's get them to the Lord. Let's
[1:51:31] get them to the Lord early. Get them
[1:51:33] baptized. get them introduced to the
[1:51:35] Lord Jesus so they understand these
[1:51:37] things. So then when the trouble hits
[1:51:39] and they hit, then when the trouble
[1:51:41] hits, they can get on their knees and
[1:51:43] they can talk to the same one that was
[1:51:45] walking through the Garden of Eden.
[1:51:48] Same one I want to talk to. God bless

[1:52:07] hands.
[1:52:09] There's going to be shouting. There's
[1:52:10] going to be clapping. There's going to
[1:52:11] be singing. And even I'm going to be
[1:52:13] able to sing good on that day.

[1:52:19] It's going to happen. God bless you,
[1:52:21] brothers and sisters. You're dismissed.
