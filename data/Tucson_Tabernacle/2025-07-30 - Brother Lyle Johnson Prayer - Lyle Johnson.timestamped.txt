[0:00] Hear the cries
[0:03] of the shackle.
[0:06] From the onset
[0:09] of time
[0:11] or the chains
[0:13] of defeat, there's no key.
[0:21] See the tears
[0:23] of the broken
[0:26] and the cries of the slaves.
[0:31] Is there no one
[0:34] worthy to set us free?
[0:40] And the crying
[0:43] is still
[0:45] as the chorus
[0:48] rings out.
[0:51] The shackle
[0:53] released from their chains.
[1:00] And thousands
[1:03] of voices
[1:05] are swelling
[1:08] the song.
[1:10] Worthy.

[2:04] and the saints of all times
[2:09] will be holding
[2:12] our crowns in our hands.
[2:19] will fall down
[2:22] before him
[2:24] joining
[2:26] in the song.

[5:05] The lamb
[5:07] that was slain.
[5:09] [Music]
[5:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[5:14] Good evening.
[5:18] &gt;&gt; Well, I heard somebody say good evening
[5:20] back. That's good. Somebody's awake out
[5:21] there. That's good. It's a bit of a
[5:23] surprise to see me up here again. Sunday
[5:26] night, Brother Daniel asked me if I
[5:27] wanted to say anything before Heather
[5:30] and I leave for the Pacific Northwest.
[5:32] The easy thing is to decline, get packed
[5:35] for the trip, not have any pressure to
[5:37] speak, but we're not called to take the
[5:40] easy path. So, here I am, and here we
[5:44] all are. Brother Daniel started a series
[5:47] on prayer this past Sunday morning and
[5:49] continued it on Sunday evening. And and
[5:52] the thoughts I want to share this
[5:53] evening are on the same topic, prayer.
[5:57] And by the way, the image on the screen
[6:01] is of two Jewish men. They've got prayer
[6:04] books. They're wearing felacteries, the
[6:06] leather straps that you see which bind
[6:08] certain passages of the Torah onto their
[6:11] arms and foreheads. They're covered in
[6:14] their prayer shaws. and they're standing
[6:16] praying at the Western Wall, the the
[6:18] remains of the retaining wall around the
[6:20] Temple Mount in Jerusalem, as near to
[6:22] the site of the original temple as they
[6:25] can be.
[6:28] Speaking of prayer, let's start. Maybe
[6:30] we can stand together and unite our
[6:33] hearts together in prayer.
[6:38] Lord Jesus, it's
[6:40] such a privilege,
[6:42] a responsibility,
[6:45] Lord, to stand here, Lord, among people
[6:48] that you gave your life for, each one.
[6:52] Lord, such such a precious, precious
[6:56] relationship that we can have with you
[6:58] and with each other. Lord, I just pray
[7:00] that you would guard my lips tonight,
[7:03] Lord, that nothing be said that would
[7:05] cause anyone difficulty or to stumble,
[7:08] but Lord, that we might just see
[7:10] something that would help us draw closer
[7:11] to you, a better understanding of your
[7:13] word, just just that relationship, Lord,
[7:17] that we so desire to grow within our
[7:19] hearts. Lord, we commit this evening to
[7:21] you. And again, we thank you for this
[7:23] awesome privilege that we have to be
[7:25] gathered together in your name, the name
[7:28] of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[7:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:34] &gt;&gt; Our topic verses this evening are found
[7:37] in the Gospel according to Mark 11. The
[7:40] context, it's Jesus' final week in
[7:43] Jerusalem. The day before Jesus had
[7:46] walked Jerusalem from Bethany. On the
[7:49] way, he found a fruitless fig tree and
[7:53] he cursed the tree that no one would
[7:55] ever eat from you again. He spent that
[7:58] day in the temple. It wasn't a quiet day
[8:00] in the temple. Amongst other things, he
[8:02] drove a lot of people out of the temple.
[8:05] Got some people a little upset with him,
[8:07] I think, and went back to Bethany to
[8:09] spend the night.
[8:11] Well, it's the following day. He and his
[8:14] disciples are again walking to
[8:16] Jerusalem. Let's begin at uh verse 20.
[8:21] And in the morning, as Jesus and his
[8:24] disciples passed by, they saw the fig
[8:27] tree dried up from the roots. And Peter
[8:32] calling to remembrance said unto Jesus,
[8:35] "Master,
[8:37] behold the fig tree which you cursed
[8:39] just yesterday. It's withered away."
[8:44] And Jesus
[8:46] answering saith unto them, "Have faith
[8:49] in God."
[8:51] Well, we often stop and hear a sermon at
[8:54] this point about faith or we use this
[8:58] song lyrics, have faith in God. That's
[9:00] all very good, but but let's continue.
[9:02] Jesus kept going. We we can keep going
[9:04] too just a little bit here. He goes on,
[9:07] "For verily
[9:10] I say unto you, whosoever shall say unto
[9:13] this mountain, be thou removed, and be
[9:16] thou cast into the sea, and shall not
[9:19] doubt in his heart, but shall believe
[9:22] that those things which he saith shall
[9:23] come to pass, he shall have whatsoever
[9:27] he saith.
[9:28] Therefore, I say unto you, whatsoever
[9:32] things you desire when you pray, believe
[9:35] that you receive them,
[9:38] and you shall have them.
[9:40] At this point, we often stop and have a
[9:43] lesson about faith to move mountains.
[9:47] And that's good. But let's keep going.
[9:49] Jesus did. He concludes his teaching
[9:52] about prayer and faith with these
[9:54] seemingly unusual and disconnected
[9:57] statements.
[9:59] And when you stand praying, forgive if
[10:03] you have ought against any.
[10:06] Why? That your father also which is in
[10:10] heaven may forgive you your trespasses.
[10:14] But if you do not forgive,
[10:16] neither will your father which is in
[10:18] heaven forgive your trespasses.
[10:22] And they continued on into Jerusalem and
[10:24] into the temple. Please be be seated.
[10:28] Tonight
[10:30] I want to talk a little bit about prayer
[10:34] but from a different perspective.
[10:37] In these verses, let's focus a bit on on
[10:40] the phrase. Anybody want to guess what
[10:42] phrase we're going to focus on
[10:46] when you stand praying.
[10:48] Now, after all, we know Jesus knelt in
[10:51] prayer in Gethsemane. A few days later,
[10:53] Daniel knelt in prayer in Babylon. So
[10:57] our focus this evening is not a lesson
[10:59] about posture
[11:02] but about context.
[11:07] What was prayer thought to be in the
[11:10] time of Jesus?
[11:13] H how did one pray? How did it evolve or
[11:16] did it evolve or change from prayer say
[11:18] in the time of David?
[11:22] Perhaps knowing the context of prayer in
[11:25] the late second temple period when Jesus
[11:27] was alive will help us better understand
[11:31] some of the statements Jesus made about
[11:34] prayer.
[11:37] In Matthew 6, Jesus says, "When thou
[11:41] prayest,
[11:43] thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are,
[11:46] for they love to stand to pray standing
[11:48] in the synagogues and in the corners of
[11:50] the streets, that they may be seen of
[11:52] men. Verily, I say unto you, they have
[11:56] their reward."
[11:58] Notice,
[12:00] why are they doing this?
[12:03] To be heard?
[12:06] No, to be seen.
[12:10] Let's go back from Jesus' time to the
[12:12] end of David's life.
[12:15] At this point, David is is praying out
[12:17] loud before the people. He's in the
[12:20] process of dedicating the things that
[12:22] have been gathered for the construction
[12:24] of the temple. Solomon has been made
[12:27] king. This is just before David's death.
[12:31] Let's read the just the opening
[12:32] sentences of his prayer. 1st Chronicles
[12:35] 29 verse 10.
[12:38] Wherefore David blessed the Lord before
[12:41] all the congregation.
[12:43] And David said, "Blessed be thou Lord
[12:46] God of Israel our father forever and
[12:50] ever. Thine, oh Lord, is the greatness,
[12:54] the power, the glory, the victory, the
[12:58] majesty. For all that is in the heaven
[13:01] and in the earth is thine. Thine is the
[13:04] kingdom, oh Lord, thou art exalted as
[13:07] head above all.
[13:10] Both riches and honor come from thee.
[13:12] Thou reignest over all, and in thine
[13:16] hand is power and might. In thine hand
[13:18] it is to make great and to give strength
[13:21] unto all.
[13:23] Now therefore, our God, we thank thee
[13:25] and praise thy glorious name.
[13:31] You can hear elements of what we call
[13:34] the Lord's prayer in David's prayer. The
[13:38] point that I want to illustrate here is
[13:41] that David's prayer is spontaneous.
[13:44] It's extemporaneous.
[13:46] It comes from his heart. He's not
[13:50] reading it. Does a better job than I do.
[13:54] He's not reading it. He He's not
[13:56] reciting it.
[14:00] What did brother Daniel bring out about
[14:02] the Bible in lesson one on prayer on
[14:04] Sunday morning?
[14:08] The focus of the Bible is not science.
[14:11] The focus of the Bible is not history.
[14:15] It's a collection of books about
[14:17] relationship.
[14:19] Relationship between God and people.
[14:24] In Jesus' time, the practice of Judaism,
[14:29] of the Jewish faith,
[14:32] included a prayer, perhaps the most
[14:34] widely known and recited prayer. It's
[14:38] called the Amadada.
[14:40] Amada in Hebrew means standing.
[14:45] Let's just take a look at its history.
[14:47] Remember, we're trying to establish
[14:49] context. What did people think when they
[14:52] heard the word prayer? How was it
[14:54] performed? What was prayer at that time?
[14:58] And what was prayer among the people who
[15:01] were among Jesus likely audience? People
[15:04] who would understand his cultural
[15:07] references like when you stand praying.
[15:12] Most of the information I'm using about
[15:14] the history and meaning of the amadas
[15:17] from the kabad.org
[15:19] website. It's it's a website that
[15:21] communicates practices and explanations
[15:24] of Orthodox Judaism.
[15:27] At the center of the Jewish daily
[15:29] prayers are 19 blessings which make up
[15:33] the silent prayer known in Hebrew is the
[15:36] amad which literally means standing.
[15:40] It's also sometimes called themonas
[15:43] which is a Hebrew word for 18 because
[15:45] there are 18 blessings within it. Now
[15:48] there are 19. The 19th was added
[15:50] actually during the time of Jesus. These
[15:53] prayers are recited three times a day
[15:59] and we read Khabad uh group explains it.
[16:03] The Torah instructs us to pray to God
[16:06] for our needs.
[16:09] The sages established that this is done.
[16:12] The sages, we're not talking about sage
[16:14] brush in the desert. When when Jewish
[16:17] people talk about sages, they're talking
[16:19] about very learned, highly respected
[16:21] men, commentators. Um uh it they're the
[16:25] people that had they lived in earlier
[16:28] times, they might have been called
[16:29] prophets, but after uh after the time of
[16:32] the destruction of of uh the temple and
[16:35] so forth, the first time around, uh they
[16:39] stopped recognizing prophets. And people
[16:42] that were very wise and learned, they
[16:44] would often call sages.
[16:46] So the sages established that this is
[16:49] done three times every day and they the
[16:52] sages composed words of praise and
[16:56] requests to be said at those times.
[16:59] Jewish tradition says that this prayer
[17:01] was established about 500 BC shortly
[17:05] after the dedication of the second
[17:06] temple under Cyrus, king of Persia.
[17:09] Tradition asserts that the group of
[17:11] sages that established it were led by
[17:14] Ezra. We have the book of Ezra. That
[17:17] same Ezra they claim established the
[17:20] Amadada.
[17:22] Now we read in the book of Daniel after
[17:25] the decree from King Das that everyone
[17:27] must pray to him and only to him for 30
[17:30] days or suffer dire punishment. We read
[17:34] in Daniel 6, "Wherefore King Duras
[17:36] signed the writing and the decree." Now
[17:39] when Daniel knew that the writing was
[17:42] signed,
[17:43] he knew the consequences. He went into
[17:46] his house and his windows being open in
[17:49] his chamber toward Jerusalem. He kneled
[17:53] upon his knees three times a day and
[17:56] prayed and gave thanks before his God as
[18:00] he did a four time.
[18:02] Whether the three times daily practice
[18:05] derived from Daniel or was in place when
[18:07] the Babylonians conquered Jerusalem and
[18:09] carried Daniel into captivity, I I I
[18:11] don't know. But it was certainly a post-
[18:14] exilic practice time after the exile as
[18:17] as we see here.
[18:21] We're told again in the Jewish
[18:23] tradition, we play what they we pray the
[18:25] shakarit with the morning prayers in the
[18:28] morning, the men literally meaning gift
[18:30] in the afternoon.
[18:32] And these are the names of the offerings
[18:35] in the temple in the morning and the
[18:38] afternoon. So, so when the lambs were
[18:40] slaughtered for sacrifice in the temple,
[18:43] the amadada was being recited. It's also
[18:46] these precise times that Jesus was
[18:48] crucified and when he died, they were
[18:51] silently praying the amadada. The third
[18:55] time is called the maiv, which means
[18:57] evening. It's done at night.
[19:01] It goes on to say that the prayers are
[19:03] identical, these three prayers, but
[19:05] they're framed by readings that vary
[19:06] according to the time of day. And the
[19:09] morning prayers, the amadas preceded by
[19:11] verses of praise, six chapters from
[19:12] psalms and other readings. There's
[19:14] there's a lot of uh structure associated
[19:18] with all of this.
[19:20] Uh the afternoon is preceded by Psalm
[19:23] 145. Heather and I read that at uh at
[19:27] our devotions this morning at the table.
[19:29] It's it's a beautiful psalm.
[19:32] Well, if you walk into a synagogue, it's
[19:35] easy to tell when the congregation is
[19:37] saying the amadada versus any of the
[19:39] other prayers. Prior to the amadada, the
[19:42] ent entire congregation stands up, takes
[19:46] three steps back.
[19:48] They take three steps forward, they bow,
[19:52] and they begin to recite.
[19:55] The amadada is said in an inaudible
[19:57] undertone, kind of a mumbling. It's not
[20:00] for the person next to you to hear. It's
[20:01] between you and God.
[20:04] At its conclusion, the person praying
[20:06] takes three steps back and three steps
[20:09] forward.
[20:11] A lot of ritual associated with this.
[20:14] The prayer is not interrupted by any
[20:16] announcements. It's not accompanied by
[20:17] any singing.
[20:20] Facing toward Jerusalem, every person
[20:22] concentrates on his or her prayers,
[20:25] often looking inside a prayer book, just
[20:28] as you saw in the title slide there.
[20:30] Many sway gently as they mouth the words
[20:34] that only they and their creator can
[20:36] hear.
[20:38] Why? Why facing toward Jerusalem?
[20:41] When Solomon dedicated the original
[20:43] temple, he prayed,
[20:46] "And now, oh God of Israel, let thy
[20:49] word, I pray thee, be verified, which
[20:51] thou spakest unto thy servant David, my
[20:53] father. But will God indeed dwell on the
[20:57] earth? Behold, the heaven and heaven and
[20:59] heavens cannot contain thee, how much
[21:02] less this house that I have builded."
[21:04] This in itself was a a shocking thing
[21:07] because in the religions of that time
[21:10] the temple was literally the house of
[21:12] their god. The god lived in the temple.
[21:16] Solomon is saying you know god doesn't
[21:18] live in this temple. This house that we
[21:20] built for him. He's not confined to this
[21:22] place. He fills the heavens.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of
[21:30] thy servant and to his supplication. Oh
[21:33] Lord my God, to hearken unto the cry and
[21:36] to the prayer which thy servant prayeth
[21:38] before thee today, that thine eyes may
[21:40] be open toward this house night and day,
[21:43] even toward the place of which thou hast
[21:45] said, "My name shall be there, that thou
[21:48] mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy
[21:51] servant shall make toward this place,
[21:53] and hearken thou to the supplication of
[21:55] thy servant, and of thy people Israel,
[22:00] when they shall pray toward this place
[22:04] and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling
[22:06] place and when thou hearest
[22:09] forgive.
[22:11] Solomon's plea is that we would be
[22:14] forgiven.
[22:16] Recognition that we're all sinners no
[22:18] matter how hard we try. We can't meet
[22:20] God's standards without his grace, his
[22:23] mercy,
[22:25] &gt;&gt; his forgiveness. Amen.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; The same thing Jesus was teaching his
[22:28] temples while looking at the dead fig
[22:30] tree as they walked to the very spot
[22:33] where Solomon prayed this prayer.
[22:38] Wh why sway gently?
[22:42] Psalm 35:10 tells us, "All my bones
[22:46] shall say, Lord, who is like unto thee,
[22:49] which delivers the poor from him that is
[22:51] too strong for him? Yay, the poor and
[22:53] the needy from him that spoilth him.
[22:56] So swaying or rocking involves the whole
[23:00] body in worship, not just the hands, not
[23:04] just the mouth, all my bones.
[23:08] That's the the scriptural basis that
[23:10] they use for that particular practice.
[23:14] And then the site goes on to explain the
[23:17] amadada again to establish context in
[23:20] Jesus day.
[23:22] says, "Every day of the year, we're
[23:24] obligated to pray three times a day."
[23:26] Right? The sages said so. On select days
[23:29] of the Jewish calendar, there are
[23:30] variations to the amadada, but it always
[23:33] includes the first three and the last
[23:35] three blessings of the Amad. The
[23:38] structure of the Amad, three blessings
[23:40] of praise, then now 13 blessings of
[23:43] requests, concluded with three blessings
[23:46] of gratitude and thanksgiving.
[23:50] Well, let's just take a little bit of a
[23:52] look at this.
[23:54] Let's look at the opening, the first
[23:56] three blessings.
[23:58] Blessing number one, my Lord, open my
[24:01] lips, and my mouth shall declare your
[24:04] praise. Why do we have lips? So we can
[24:07] praise the Lord. Blessed are you, Lord
[24:10] our God, and God of our fathers. God of
[24:12] Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, the
[24:15] great, mighty, and awesome God, exalted
[24:18] God who bestows bountiful kindness, who
[24:21] creates all things, who remembers the
[24:23] piety of the patriarchs, and who in love
[24:26] brings a redeemer to their children's
[24:28] children for the sake of his name. Oh
[24:30] king, you are a helper, a savior, and a
[24:33] shield. Blessed are you, Lord, shield of
[24:35] Abraham.
[24:37] saying this silently between you and the
[24:40] Lord.
[24:42] Second blessing, you are mighty forever,
[24:46] my lord. You resurrect the dead. I don't
[24:49] think the Sadducees prayed this part of
[24:51] the Amadada. You resurrect the dead. You
[24:53] are powerful to save. In the summer, he
[24:56] causes the due to descend. In the
[24:59] winter, he causes the wind to blow and
[25:01] the rain to fall. He sustains the living
[25:04] with loving kindness. resurrects the
[25:06] dead with great mercy, supports the
[25:09] falling, heals the sick, releases the
[25:13] bound, fulfills his trust to those who
[25:16] sleep in the dust. Who is like you,
[25:20] mighty one? Who can be compared to you,
[25:22] King, who brings death and restores life
[25:26] and causes deliverance to spring forth?
[25:32] And the third blessing, you are holy.
[25:35] Your name is holy. Holy beings praise
[25:38] you daily for all eternity. Blessed are
[25:41] you, Lord, the holy God. This brings to
[25:44] mind Isaiah the saraphim flying around.
[25:47] Holy, holy, holy unto the Lord. I think
[25:51] you'd have to agree this is a beautiful
[25:53] prayer.
[25:54] &gt;&gt; These are wonderful thoughts.
[25:57] Well, rather than read the entire
[25:59] Amadada, an English translation of it,
[26:02] here's an explanatory summary of it from
[26:05] the Kabad website with a few comments
[26:07] that I've put in. And notice that the
[26:10] blessings 4 through 16 varies. Sometimes
[26:12] they're replaced or modified. This is
[26:14] the daily amadada. It's different on
[26:17] Shabbat. It's different on holidays.
[26:19] I'm sure in the opening section we just
[26:21] read, the Sadducees would leave out any
[26:23] references to resurrection.
[26:26] Well, starting with the fourth blessing,
[26:29] we ask for wisdom before all else. Since
[26:33] without wisdom, we can't accomplish
[26:36] anything at all.
[26:37] &gt;&gt; After we have wisdom, we begin to
[26:39] recognize our faults
[26:41] &gt;&gt; and correct them. Therefore, we pray for
[26:43] repentance after praying for wisdom.
[26:47] Only after we have corrected our ways
[26:49] can we ask for forgiveness for past
[26:51] wrongs. Thus, we pray for forgiveness.
[26:55] After praying for repentance,
[26:58] after we have completed repairing our
[27:00] past misdeeds, we want to continue to
[27:02] grow in our Torah study,
[27:06] the word service of God. But we
[27:09] recognize how the great difficulties in
[27:11] our lives hinder us from that growth. So
[27:14] here we pray for redemption from the
[27:17] general difficulties of life.
[27:20] after we've emerged from the greater
[27:21] difficulties. We realize the particular
[27:23] ailments we have that need to be healed.
[27:26] So we pray for healing.
[27:30] Well, during illness, there's often no
[27:32] desire for food. So after praying for
[27:34] healing, we're ready to pray for
[27:35] abundance in produce and in livelihood.
[27:40] After we ask for our basic needs to be
[27:42] fulfilled, we begin to pray for greater
[27:44] and more general blessings, namely the
[27:46] gathering of all the Jewish people in
[27:49] Israel. return from exile.
[27:52] Th this prayer of course was answered in
[27:54] some of our lifetimes in 1948 as Israel
[27:57] was formed and the exiles began to
[28:00] return in abundance.
[28:02] The gathering of the Jewish people will
[28:05] be followed by reinstating the judges
[28:07] who will punish the wicked. Therefore,
[28:09] the text two blessings are requests for
[28:11] reinstating our judges and for punishing
[28:14] the wicked. They tie these two together.
[28:16] This blessing number 12 to punish the
[28:18] wicked came about during the Roman
[28:20] occupation.
[28:24] When that happens, this causes the
[28:26] exaltation of the righteous which is the
[28:29] following request.
[28:31] These developments leading up to the
[28:33] coming of the Messiah will take place in
[28:35] Jerusalem. So here we request that God
[28:38] return his divine presence to Jerusalem.
[28:42] Next, we request the coming of the
[28:45] Messiah, who will be a descendant of
[28:47] King David.
[28:49] At that point, the holy temple, which
[28:51] God refers to as my house of prayer,
[28:54] will be rebuilt. So, here is the request
[28:57] that God accepts all our prayers.
[29:01] Then we will resume the service in the
[29:04] holy temple. So, we ask that the service
[29:06] of the holy temple be reestablished. Of
[29:09] course, in Jesus' time, the temple had
[29:11] been restored and service reestablished.
[29:14] So, the current form of the Amadada
[29:16] reflects the second destruction of the
[29:17] temple in 70 AD.
[29:20] This then is followed by a blessing of
[29:22] thanks for all the good God bestows upon
[29:25] us.
[29:26] Although we've just alluded to the fact
[29:28] that we're currently in exile with all
[29:30] of its difficulties, we acknowledge the
[29:32] abundant good that God gives us each and
[29:34] every day. And finally, after mentioning
[29:37] God's kindnesses to us, we beseech God
[29:39] to continue to bless us and be gracious
[29:42] to us. That's the content of the
[29:45] almadada. This is what people would pray
[29:47] this or something very similar to it in
[29:50] Jesus day. When you stand praying
[29:54] quietly, you're standing, you're praying
[29:57] three times a day,
[29:59] this is what they would pray.
[30:03] Well, Jesus often railed against
[30:05] traditions replacing the commandments
[30:08] like the washing of hands and so forth.
[30:10] When I lived in Israel, a rabbi once
[30:13] told me that the rules and the
[30:14] traditions, he he told me, he said,
[30:16] "Lose of this is is to form a wall. If
[30:19] if if this is what God's word commands
[30:22] us to do, we want to build a fence
[30:24] that's a bit further around that." So
[30:26] that if we violate that, we haven't
[30:29] violated God's commandments, but but we
[30:31] humble ourselves and withdraw. And so
[30:33] we're we're protecting ourselves from
[30:35] violating God's commands. Of course, the
[30:38] danger is that that you're now focused
[30:40] on the fence.
[30:45] Jesus point I think that was focusing
[30:48] not on violating the rules and
[30:50] traditions. You were in danger of being
[30:52] unaware of the commands. There things
[30:53] that God said. They become of none
[30:55] effect as the King James puts it. Again,
[30:57] we're trying to establish context for
[31:00] prayer amongst the Jewish people in the
[31:03] time of Jesus.
[31:05] Why did recited prayers become the norm?
[31:08] We saw Solomon praying from his heart,
[31:10] David praying from his heart. We read in
[31:13] the Bible, Josiah, Hezekiah, so many
[31:15] people, they weren't reading a prayer.
[31:19] Again, from the Kabad organization, they
[31:22] talk a little bit about a fellow called
[31:24] Mammonites, and I'm probably pronouncing
[31:25] that wrong. He was a prominent Jewish
[31:27] sage in the middle ages about the 12th
[31:30] century. He lived in Egypt. Well, his
[31:33] writings indicate that until the
[31:35] destruction of the original holy temple,
[31:37] everyone prayed in their own words.
[31:40] When the Jews were in exile, however,
[31:43] their language became a mix of distorted
[31:46] Hebrew and some other languages of the
[31:48] regions of their exiles. We hear about
[31:50] Aramaic being the the language in Jesus
[31:53] time, a a kind of Hebrew.
[31:56] As a result, according to Mammoth, they
[31:58] weren't able to express themselves
[32:00] properly in prayer. Therefore, Ezra and
[32:05] his uh his he calls it rabbitical court
[32:08] established a set text for everyone to
[32:11] use.
[32:13] Amada.
[32:15] The prayers, we say, take the place of
[32:18] the daily sacrifices brought in the holy
[32:21] temple. The the men of the great
[32:22] assembly who composed and compiled the
[32:25] prayers knew exactly which words and
[32:28] letters to use that would substitute for
[32:30] the sacrifices and bring about the same
[32:33] spiritual effect as the sacrifices would
[32:35] have.
[32:37] Thus, no need for animal sacrifices, no
[32:39] need for a suffering messiah. Remember,
[32:42] this is in the 12th century. It's the
[32:44] middle ages. Jews have been persecuted
[32:46] by Christians for a thousand years by
[32:48] now. So he wants to make sure that
[32:50] they've got that base covered.
[32:52] There's an additional need for a fixed
[32:54] text when it comes to praising God.
[32:57] Praising any entity implies the ability
[33:00] to judge and evaluate that entity. In
[33:02] other words, one who praises is
[33:05] expressing some degree of superiority
[33:07] over the praised one. I congratulate my
[33:10] child. He's done a good job on something
[33:12] and that's good. But if my child
[33:14] congratulates me on doing a good job,
[33:16] well, maybe I did a good job and maybe I
[33:18] didn't, what is I mean, he's a little
[33:20] kid, you know. So a lay person telling a
[33:23] worldclass musician, I I think you play
[33:25] well can be considered humorous or even
[33:28] disrespectful
[33:30] for us humans to praise God for his
[33:32] power and kindness. Denies his true
[33:36] denies they say his true indescribable
[33:39] greatness and the unbridgegable gap
[33:41] between us finite creations and the
[33:44] infinite creator.
[33:46] Therefore, the the Talmud, which is the
[33:48] central text of rabbitic Judaism, think
[33:51] of it as like the Book of Mormon to a
[33:53] member of the Mormon church, the Talmud
[33:55] tells us it's prohibited for an
[33:58] individual to choose how to praise God
[34:00] and describe God's greatness, which
[34:02] would be an act of evaluating and
[34:04] limiting God's greatness. Rather, we use
[34:06] the prescribed praises that our sages
[34:08] have composed based on verses from the
[34:12] Torah.
[34:14] Perhaps it can be added the same applies
[34:16] to the requests in the amadada
[34:18] requesting also implies at least some
[34:20] sense of entitlement or deservingness.
[34:24] Of course, we depend on God's grace. At
[34:27] the very least, it shows that the one
[34:28] requesting has the right to speak to the
[34:30] one being asked. If we were to truly
[34:33] fathom the infinity of God's presence in
[34:35] our own smallalness, we wouldn't feel
[34:37] worthy of asking him anything.
[34:41] Therefore, every request we have indeed
[34:43] the very concept of prayer in the first
[34:45] place needs to be justified by being
[34:47] mandated and alluded to in God's word in
[34:51] his Torah. Again, this is Jewish
[34:53] thought.
[34:55] Despite all this, it should be noted
[34:56] that our sages throughout the
[34:58] generations have recognized and
[35:00] cautioned against the risk of fixed
[35:03] liturgy becoming routine and absent of
[35:06] genuine feeling.
[35:09] Some rabbis have encouraged those
[35:11] praying to add personal intentions or
[35:13] requests in the middle of the blessings
[35:15] so one's prayers will be said with
[35:16] genuine feeling and passion. They
[35:18] recognize the danger. Now, that's mostly
[35:21] from the kabad.org website.
[35:24] Back to us here this evening.
[35:27] We spent a fair amount of time looking
[35:29] at the amadada, the reasons for it and
[35:32] its recitation. This again is to help us
[35:35] understand the context of prayer in
[35:37] Jesus time. the general Jewish
[35:39] perspective of it to this day. I recall
[35:42] a Jewish acquaintance of mine who came
[35:45] to Christianity mentioned that for the
[35:47] first time in his life, prayer was an
[35:50] expression in his own words from his own
[35:53] heart, not reciting someone else's
[35:55] words.
[35:56] From all this, we see why there was such
[35:59] a focus on recitation of prayers in the
[36:02] second temple period. Why? The most
[36:04] common prayer and most widely known was
[36:07] the amadada. It was said almost silently
[36:10] while standing which shows respect. The
[36:12] one being addressed in this case, the
[36:14] Lord certainly outranks the petitioner.
[36:18] But
[36:19] with that little bit of background, it's
[36:21] okay to wake up now. With that little
[36:23] bit of background, let's go back to
[36:24] Matthew 6 and read just a little bit
[36:26] more.
[36:28] Jesus saying, "When thou prayest, thou
[36:30] shalt not be as the hypocrites are, for
[36:32] they love to pray standing in the
[36:35] synagogues and in the corners of the
[36:37] streets, that they may be seen of men.
[36:41] Verily I say to you, they have their
[36:43] reward.
[36:45] But thou, when thou prayest, enter into
[36:50] thy closet. When thou hast shut thy
[36:53] door, pray to thy father which is in
[36:55] secret, and thy father which seeth in
[36:57] secret shall move toward thee openly.
[37:00] It's between you and God, not for show,
[37:03] not to be seen.
[37:08] And when you pray, use not vain
[37:11] repetitions the heathen do, for they
[37:14] think they shall be heard for their much
[37:16] speaking.
[37:18] Be ye not therefore like unto them. For
[37:21] your father knoweth what things you have
[37:23] need of before you ask him
[37:27] after this manner, not necessarily to
[37:29] recite, although that's okay, but as an
[37:33] acceptable structure perhaps, therefore
[37:34] pray ye
[37:36] our father which in heaven, hallowed be
[37:39] thy name.
[37:41] This corresponds to the opening
[37:43] blessings of the Amadaha, if you will,
[37:45] that they can associate with in their
[37:46] mind. praise next to the requests. Thy
[37:50] kingdom come,
[37:52] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[37:55] heaven.
[37:57] Give us this day our daily bread.
[38:00] Forgive us our debts as we forgive our
[38:03] debtors,
[38:05] and lead us not into temptation, but
[38:07] deliver us from evil.
[38:11] And the last corresponds to gratitude
[38:13] and thanks and expression of humility.
[38:15] For thine is the kingdom and the power
[38:17] and the glory forever.
[38:20] Amen.
[38:22] This whole amadada
[38:25] has been compressed in just a few words.
[38:29] Jesus goes on,
[38:32] for if you forgive men their trespasses,
[38:35] your heavenly father will also forgive
[38:37] you.
[38:39] But if you forgive not men their
[38:40] trespasses, neither will your father
[38:42] forgive your trespasses.
[38:45] Jesus keeps hammering at this theme of
[38:49] forgiveness. Solomon mentioned it. Lord,
[38:51] when you hear our prayers, forgive us.
[38:54] Jesus is talking about forgiveness. And
[38:58] isn't that at the heart of the gospel?
[39:00] really the good news that God loves us,
[39:04] is ready to forgive us if we'll accept
[39:07] his love and correction, to live a life
[39:09] that is further from sin and closer to
[39:12] holiness,
[39:13] to establish a relationship with him.
[39:19] Let's look at another time Jesus was
[39:20] asked by his disciples about prayer
[39:22] found in Luke's gospel account.
[39:25] Jesus isn't talking about forgiveness,
[39:29] but about how to receive the power to
[39:32] forgive.
[39:34] Luke 11,
[39:37] it came to pass that as he was praying,
[39:40] he Jesus was praying in a certain place.
[39:43] When he ceased, one of his disciples
[39:45] said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray.
[39:49] John also taught his disciples again
[39:51] looking for a form. Yeah. And Jesus said
[39:55] unto them, when you pray, say, Our
[39:58] Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be
[40:01] thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be
[40:05] done. As in heaven, so in earth. Give us
[40:09] day by day, our daily day by day. This
[40:12] is an ongoing relationship. It's not,
[40:15] well, Lord, give me month supply of food
[40:17] and I'll be back on the first of next
[40:18] month to pray to you again. No, give us
[40:20] this day. Every day, give us this day.
[40:23] Maybe it's meal by meal, right? You want
[40:26] that relationship, that continued
[40:29] connection. Forgive us our sins, for we
[40:33] also forgive everyone that is indebted
[40:35] to us. And lead us not into temptation,
[40:39] but deliver us from evil.
[40:43] And now another lesson that is often
[40:45] taken or presented in part. Jesus goes
[40:47] on said unto them, "Which of you shall
[40:51] have a friend? should go unto him at
[40:53] midnight and say unto him, "Friend, lend
[40:57] me three loaves, for a friend of mine in
[41:00] his journey has come to me, and I have
[41:01] nothing to set before him."
[41:04] Midnight, banging on the door. He from
[41:07] within shall answer and say, "Don't
[41:10] bother me. Trouble me not. The door
[41:13] shut. My children are with me in bed.
[41:15] Everybody's asleep. I can't rise and
[41:16] give you."
[41:19] I say unto you, though he will not rise
[41:22] and give him because he is his friend,
[41:24] yet because of his importunity, he will
[41:27] rise and give him as many as he needeth.
[41:30] Importunity.
[41:33] Importunity. It's an unusual word.
[41:37] Anyone know the definition of
[41:39] importunity?
[41:42] Well, I'll help you out then.
[41:45] A Jewish person might say it means
[41:47] hutzbah,
[41:48] shameless audacity, shameless
[41:51] persistence
[41:53] because you're there making a pest out
[41:55] of yourself. I'll get up and give you
[41:57] the bread. Leave me alone.
[42:00] You may recall a parable of the unjust
[42:02] judge where a woman kept after a judge
[42:05] until he finally gave her what she
[42:06] wanted just to stop her from annoying
[42:08] him. It's the same thing here. Well,
[42:11] let's continue. Will he talk about
[42:13] forgiveness?
[42:16] And I say unto you, ask and it shall be
[42:20] given you. Seek and you shall find.
[42:24] Knock and it shall be opened unto you.
[42:27] Ask. Seek. Bang on the door. For what?
[42:33] For what?
[42:35] For everyone that askketh receiveth. He
[42:38] that seeks finds. To him that knocks it
[42:41] shall be opened.
[42:44] What's he talking about? He gives an
[42:46] example. If a son shall ask bread of any
[42:50] of you that is a father, will he give
[42:51] him a stone?
[42:54] Or if he asks for a fish, will he give
[42:58] him a snake, a serpent? If he shall ask
[43:01] an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?
[43:06] Of course not.
[43:08] If ye then being evil know how to give
[43:12] good gifts unto your children
[43:16] but but but all this about seeking,
[43:19] finding, knocking, it isn't about us.
[43:24] It's all about him. So what is it that
[43:27] he wants to give us? What is it that we
[43:30] should seek and ask and knock on his
[43:33] door to receive?
[43:37] How much more shall your heavenly father
[43:39] give the Holy Spirit to them that ask
[43:43] him?
[43:44] It's what he's talking about.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; That's what he's talking about. That's
[43:49] what we're to ask for. That's what we're
[43:52] to seek. That's what we're to knock
[43:54] until he answers. To be filled with his
[43:57] spirit. And that will, among other
[43:59] things, give us the power to forgive.
[44:02] And that will then enable us to be
[44:05] forgiven.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; Let's look at two more examples.
[44:11] One of a parable about two men praying
[44:14] and one about a prayer of Jesus. In Luke
[44:18] 18, we read, "And Jesus spake this
[44:21] parable unto," he's not saying about
[44:24] this guy. He's not talking about some.
[44:25] He's saying it to certain which trusted
[44:28] in themselves that they were righteous
[44:30] and despised others.
[44:33] And maybe he said something like this.
[44:35] You know what you guys remind me of? Let
[44:37] me tell you a story. Two men went into
[44:40] the temple to pray. The one a Pharisee,
[44:42] a person who tried very hard to conform
[44:44] to the law. And the other a publican, a
[44:47] collaborator with the hated Roman
[44:50] occupiers.
[44:52] The Pharisees stood and prayed thus with
[44:55] himself, not out loud,
[44:58] saying it to himself as he stood in an
[45:00] attitude of prayer. God, I thank thee.
[45:04] I'm not as other men are. I there's
[45:08] extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or
[45:11] even as this publican. I fast twice in
[45:14] the week. I give tithes of all that I
[45:16] possess.
[45:18] I'm doing pretty good, Lord.
[45:22] And the publican standing a far off
[45:24] would not so much as raise his eyes to
[45:27] heaven but smokeote upon
[45:31] okay you're awake smote upon his breast
[45:34] saying God be merciful to me a sinner I
[45:39] know I'm not measuring up to your
[45:40] standards Lord help me be merciful can't
[45:43] look up be merciful to me
[45:47] Jesus says I tell you the publican went
[45:49] down to his house justified rather than
[45:52] the Pharisee.
[45:54] For everyone that exaltth himself shall
[45:57] be abased, and he that humble himself
[46:01] shall be exalted.
[46:03] It's not about us. It's not about what
[46:07] we do.
[46:09] As we dug into our final lesson about
[46:12] David last week, we saw that our motive
[46:15] must be of love of God and love of
[46:17] neighbor. We're told that on this
[46:19] everything hangs and the actions of
[46:22] treating others the way wish to we wish
[46:25] to be treated completed that that was
[46:28] the law of the prophets when it's
[46:30] hanging on or its foundation is love of
[46:32] God and love of your neighbor. Paul
[46:35] tells us in first Corinthians about many
[46:37] of the attributes of love.
[46:40] I've experienced over the years people
[46:43] who insist that that's all well and
[46:46] good, that's all wishy-washy. Brother
[46:48] Lyle, don't you know love is corrective.
[46:52] They use it as a weapon to attack anyone
[46:55] who disagrees with them or their
[46:56] particular doctrines or viewpoints. I
[46:58] love you. I'm just correcting you.
[47:02] I'm sure you've never run into that.
[47:04] I've I've run into that. Jesus projected
[47:06] his form of love when as he was being
[47:10] crucified by whom?
[47:13] Physically, his neighbors who also
[47:17] happened to be his oppressors.
[47:21] But it was my sin that put him there.
[47:25] So he said this regarding me, cried out
[47:28] in his agony, "Father, forgive them.
[47:33] Forgive brother Lyall. They don't
[47:36] understand what they're doing.
[47:41] On his last night in Jerusalem, after
[47:44] the last supper, before he and the
[47:46] remaining 11 disciples left the upper
[47:49] room for Gethsemane,
[47:51] Jesus lifted up his eyes to heaven and
[47:53] he prayed.
[47:58] I'll share just a few short sections of
[48:00] that prayer found in the Gospel
[48:01] according to St. John, chapter 17. It's
[48:04] often referred to as Jesus high priestly
[48:06] prayer. I suspect but don't know but I
[48:10] suspect brother Daniel will be covering
[48:12] it in more detail as his series and
[48:14] prayer continues. I'm not putting words
[48:16] in his mouth
[48:20] John 17
[48:23] Jesus has been praying. He says, "And
[48:24] now I am no more in the world, but these
[48:28] are in the world, and I come to thee,
[48:31] holy father, keep through thine own name
[48:35] those whom thou hast given me." Why?
[48:39] That they may be one as we are.
[48:44] Unity, not through head knowledge, but
[48:48] through heart relationship.
[48:51] Skipping to verse 15. I pray not that
[48:53] thou should us take them out of the
[48:55] world, but that thou should us keep them
[48:58] from the evil
[49:00] reminds us of the closing lines of what
[49:03] we call the Lord's prayer. Lead us not
[49:05] into temptation, but deliver us from
[49:07] evil. Jesus is very consistent in his
[49:11] message throughout the gospels.
[49:14] On to verse 18.
[49:17] As thou hast sent me into the world,
[49:20] even so have I also sent them into the
[49:23] world. And he will later say, "Go ye
[49:26] into all the worlds and preach the
[49:28] gospel. For their sakes I sanctify
[49:31] myself, that they also might be
[49:34] sanctified
[49:36] through the truth. Neither pray I for
[49:38] these alone, but for them also which
[49:41] shall believe on me through their word."
[49:45] That's each of us.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; None of us were physically alive when
[49:50] Jesus walked the earth. I know I'm old,
[49:53] but I'm not that old. But we know, how
[49:57] do we know of him? Through the testimony
[49:59] of others throughout the ages. We know
[50:02] him through we we know of him. And we
[50:05] know him through applying that testimony
[50:10] in our lives to ask to seek
[50:14] to knock until we receive his Holy
[50:18] Spirit
[50:21] that they all may be one. That's the
[50:24] goal. As thou, Father, art in me and I
[50:28] in thee. That they also may be one in
[50:30] us. that the world may believe that thou
[50:35] hast sent me. And the glory which thou
[50:38] gavest me, I have given them, that they
[50:42] may be one, even as we are one.
[50:47] I in them, thou in me, that they may be
[50:52] made perfect, complete,
[50:54] and one,
[50:56] that the world may know that thou hast
[50:58] sent me and hast loved them as thou hast
[51:02] loved me.
[51:05] A few hours earlier that same evening,
[51:07] Jesus had said to the 11,
[51:11] "A new commandment I give unto you, that
[51:14] you love one another, as I have loved
[51:18] you, that ye also love one another. By
[51:22] this shall all men know that ye are my
[51:25] disciples, if you have love one to
[51:30] another." Musicians could could please
[51:33] come.
[51:35] It's not about rules.
[51:37] It's about relationship.
[51:40] Relationship comes about and is
[51:42] strengthened through communication.
[51:46] Our channel of communication
[51:48] is prayer, not wrote recitation.
[51:53] Communication,
[51:54] heart-to-heart.
[51:56] The relationship God wants with us and
[51:58] for us to have with each other is that
[52:01] of love.
[52:03] In 1954,
[52:05] brother Brandham observed in a sermon
[52:07] that he preached that May called the
[52:09] seven church ages. He says, "Now John,
[52:12] he's talking about the disciple John.
[52:15] Now John being old that they are told by
[52:18] historians that he was brought to the
[52:21] the church to preach. And he was so old
[52:24] the only thing he would say was little
[52:27] children
[52:29] love one another.
[52:32] I tell you that's a very good thing to
[52:34] preach on. Little children love one
[52:38] another. As I get old in the ministry
[52:41] now about my 21st year, I think all the
[52:44] time as I go along that this the more I
[52:47] think of the Lord Jesus,
[52:49] the more I begin to find out that it's
[52:52] love that covers the whole thing,
[52:56] the love of God shed abroad in our heart
[53:00] by the Holy Spirit.
[53:03] In his later life, the disciple John
[53:06] present during the events in Jesus life
[53:08] that we read tonight wrote in 1 John 3,
[53:12] "This is the message you have heard from
[53:14] the beginning that we should love one
[53:17] another."
[53:19] My little children, let us not love in
[53:22] word, neither in tongue, but in deed and
[53:26] in truth.
[53:28] A little later in that same letter, he
[53:30] says, "Beloved, if God so loved us, we
[53:34] ought also to love one another."
[53:39] And finally, one that my wife quotes a
[53:43] lot, we love him because he first loved
[53:48] us.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; I I thank the Lord for each of you this
[53:53] evening. Heather and I, God willing,
[53:56] will be leaving in a couple days for a
[53:58] number of family events in the Pacific
[54:00] Northwest. We may be gone as long as six
[54:03] weeks. It's a little uncertain, but we
[54:06] ask for your prayers for safe travels in
[54:09] return to fellowship with you all.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; If we could stand,
[54:16] we're not going to recite the Amadada. I
[54:18] I won't put it up on the screen, but I'd
[54:21] like us to sing. Blessed be the tithe
[54:24] that binds. I modified verse three just
[54:26] a bit, so pay attention.
[54:28] [Music]
[54:30] Blessed be the tie that binds
[54:37] our hearts in Christian love.
[54:43] The fellowship
[54:46] of kindred minds is like to that above
[54:54] [Music]
[54:56] before our father's throne.
[55:02] We pour our hearted prayers,
[55:08] &gt;&gt; our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,
[55:15] our comforts and our cares.
[55:19] [Music]
[55:21] We share our mutual woes,
[55:27] our mutual
[55:29] burdens bear.
[55:33] And often for each other flows the
[55:40] empathizing
[55:42] prayer.
[55:43] [Music]
[55:45] When we are under parts,
[55:51] it gives us inward pain.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; But we shall still be joined in heart
[56:02] and hope to meet again.
[56:07] Let's sing the verse verse once more as
[56:10] our pastor comes.
[56:13] Blessed be the tide that binds
[56:19] our hearts in Christian love.
[56:25] The fellow fellowship
[56:28] of joy
[56:31] is like to that above.
[56:35] [Music]
