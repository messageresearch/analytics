[20:31] Brother Menow, Sister Fzen. Wow.
[20:34] Welcome. God bless you. Give Give this
[20:37] brother a hand.
[20:44] In my opinion, one of the finest
[20:50] brothers that have come from brother
[20:52] Brandham's message with the one of the
[20:55] most um integrity
[20:58] that uh that I know of is this man here,
[21:01] brother Men Fzen and one of the most
[21:04] respected people. I know that brother
[21:07] Brandham said about brother Bosworth.
[21:11] He said that that no one could put a
[21:15] finger on him because of the life that
[21:17] he lived and the um the example that he
[21:21] set. And brother Menow, I think the same
[21:25] about you, my friend. You are an
[21:26] inspiration to so many of us.
[21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh would you come up and uh at
[21:36] the minimum open in prayer?
[21:44] Should I have them be seated or remain
[21:47] standing?
[21:52] &gt;&gt; You can be seated.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; Good to see you.
[21:58] &gt;&gt; Good to see you.
[22:01] You you honor me. And just so you know,
[22:03] if id have known he was going to be
[22:06] here, we might have a bit of a different
[22:08] service tonight because uh brother Menow
[22:11] is he is he's he's one of the finest
[22:13] finest people I've ever met and uh I
[22:16] think it's an honor if you would say a
[22:18] few words for our congregation.
[22:23] Well, thank you, brother. I don't I'd
[22:25] have to live pretty high to to meet
[22:28] that.
[22:29] But thank you very much. After all,
[22:31] there's one of the ghost most glorious
[22:33] things is that this blessed gospel of
[22:36] the Lord Jesus is
[22:38] what makes all men look different when
[22:40] you see them through the eyes of the
[22:42] Lord Jesus.
[22:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:44] &gt;&gt; And uh we do believe we have the eyes
[22:47] and the mind and the heart of the Lord
[22:50] Jesus.
[22:52] We didn't take on the strange spirit. We
[22:54] took on the Holy Spirit.
[22:56] I believe always got room for for
[22:59] others. Room. Room. Yes, there's room.
[23:02] It's a room at the fountain for me. And
[23:04] I'm very glad we just pulled in a few
[23:06] days ago and wanted to get some of this
[23:08] warm weather you've got and warm
[23:10] fellowship and and uh it's good to be
[23:13] here tonight, take in the fellowship and
[23:16] uh be a part of you,
[23:18] which I believe we are that by election.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; We didn't choose him. He chose us. I
[23:25] wasn't looking for him. In fact, most of
[23:27] my young age, I was running from him.
[23:30] &gt;&gt; But I'm so glad he stopped me
[23:32] &gt;&gt; while I was still young enough to
[23:33] appreciate. He stopped me when I was
[23:35] about 19 years old. And uh I don't
[23:38] regret a mile I've traveled for the
[23:40] Lord. I don't regret the time I've
[23:42] trusted in his word.
[23:45] &gt;&gt; I've seen the years go by, many days
[23:46] without a song, but I don't regret a
[23:48] mile I've traveled for the Lord. So
[23:51] let's thank him tonight as we bow before
[23:52] him. Heavenly Father, we thank you so
[23:54] much for your goodness.
[23:57] David said, "Thy loving kindness is
[23:59] better than life." What can be better
[24:01] than life? It's to have eternal life in
[24:04] a mortal body, Lord. And we are bad that
[24:07] we're on the battlefield. We know that.
[24:08] But greater is he that's in us than he
[24:10] that's in the world. In a little while,
[24:12] the world will see me no more, but
[24:13] you'll see me for I'll be with you, even
[24:16] in you, to the consummation of time. And
[24:18] Lord, we realize that we're at the most
[24:20] most glorious time there is of all the
[24:23] ages to have seen the end and the ta
[24:26] tapering off and the the coming to pass
[24:28] of the reality of a kingdom that never
[24:31] will end. The kingdoms of this world
[24:33] will soon be fall. But we shall see the
[24:36] king when he comes. We see you now the
[24:38] great appearance of your presence, the
[24:40] Holy Spirit, the pillar of fire
[24:41] returning to take a people back to Eden.
[24:45] Take it back to the place of the word of
[24:47] God and fellowship. Lord, we thank you
[24:49] tonight. Bless us around your word,
[24:51] Lord. Make it word. Make it bred to our
[24:54] hearts. We commit ourselves to you in
[24:56] this service in Jesus Christ's name.
[24:58] Amen. Amen. God bless you all. And thank
[25:01] you my brother.
[25:12] I am redeemed. Bought with a price.
[25:16] As brother Tim gets that up, my mom is
[25:19] sitting here and she can tell you when I
[25:20] was little, this was one of the first
[25:22] songs I liked to sing. I am redeemed,
[25:24] bought with a price. Jesus has changed
[25:26] my whole life.
[25:29] I am redeemed,
[25:34] bought with a price.
[25:39] Jesus
[25:41] has changed my whole life.
[25:48] If anybody
[25:51] asks you
[25:53] just who I am,
[25:58] tell them
[26:00] I am redeemed. Verse one.
[26:07] Where there was hate,
[26:12] love now
[26:14] abounds.
[26:16] Where there was confusion,
[26:20] peace now reigns.
[26:25] I'm walking
[26:27] with Jesus.
[26:29] I'm a child of the King. Oh, and it's
[26:35] all because
[26:37] I am redeemed.
[26:42] Oh,
[26:44] I am redeemed.
[26:48] I am bought with a price.
[26:53] Jesus
[26:55] has changed my whole life.
[27:02] If anybody
[27:04] asks you
[27:07] just who I am,
[27:11] tell them
[27:13] I am redeemed. Verse two,
[27:19] I'll tell of
[27:22] his favor.
[27:24] I'll tell of his love.
[27:28] I'll tell of
[27:31] his goodness
[27:33] to me.
[27:37] He purchase
[27:40] my redemption
[27:42] with his precious blood
[27:46] and from sin
[27:49] he set me free.
[27:53] Oh yes, I am redeemed.
[28:00] I'm bought with a prize.
[28:04] Lord Jesus
[28:06] has changed my whole life.
[28:12] Well, if anybody
[28:15] asks you
[28:18] just who I am,
[28:22] tell them
[28:24] I am redeemed.
[28:28] You know something? There's a whole lot
[28:31] of gossip in the world. There's a whole
[28:34] lot of did you hear about so and so? So,
[28:37] when someone asks you about somebody,
[28:39] hey, what's going on with that person?
[28:41] look them in the face and say they are
[28:43] redeemed.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; Why don't we speak good things over each
[28:47] other? No matter what situation they're
[28:49] in,
[28:50] &gt;&gt; maybe if they haven't even come to the
[28:52] Lord yet, say they are redeemed and and
[28:55] claim it by faith. Sister Hope, if you
[28:57] want to come, get ready.
[29:00] &gt;&gt; Let's sing that chorus again. I am
[29:04] redeemed
[29:06] but with a price.
[29:10] Jesus
[29:12] has changed my whole life.
[29:19] If anybody
[29:21] asks you
[29:24] just who I am,
[29:28] tell them
[29:30] I am redeemed.
[29:34] If anybody
[29:37] asks you
[29:39] just who
[29:41] I am,
[29:43] tell them
[29:46] I am redeemed.

[38:18] &gt;&gt; Joined him in his death. came up
[38:21] resurrected in his life. That's us
[38:24] tonight. Sinners slain. And that's why
[38:26] we can praise him.
[38:29] I should start by saying good evening.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; Tonight we'll be observing communion. So
[38:36] I'll be brief perhaps 30 minutes or so.
[38:39] Communion is our topic.
[38:43] What do we mean when we say communion?
[38:47] More importantly, what does the Bible
[38:50] mean when we read the word communion?
[38:53] Why do we observe communion?
[38:56] Is it important?
[39:01] Before reading from the Bible, let's
[39:04] approach the Lord together one more
[39:06] time, joining our hearts in prayer.
[39:11] Lord Jesus, this is an awesome evening.
[39:15] Lord, a time when we can participate in
[39:18] this sacrament of communion.
[39:21] And Lord, we pray that you'd help us to
[39:23] better understand and more importantly,
[39:26] Lord, to just draw closer to you, to
[39:29] draw closer to one another, to lay aside
[39:32] the burdens of this life, to enter,
[39:34] Lord, into the fellowship of your
[39:36] spirit. Lord, I pray that whatever is
[39:39] said tonight would help and not hinder
[39:41] anyone. Lord, guard my lips. If
[39:44] something is said that's incorrect,
[39:45] Lord, help no one to hear it. Lord,
[39:48] anoint the ears that are here. And Lord,
[39:51] thank you. Thank you for the privilege,
[39:54] the opportunity, the responsibility to
[39:57] speak to those whom you purchased with
[39:59] your own blood. We thank you. We thank
[40:02] you this evening in Jesus precious name.
[40:05] Amen.
[40:07] Uh before you're seated this evening,
[40:11] we'll turn back the clock to the time of
[40:14] Moses.
[40:15] Then we'll move to the time of Jesus.
[40:18] Then to that of the early church, the
[40:21] context of what we call communion was a
[40:25] Passover observance on Jesus final
[40:29] night. So let's take a very brief look
[40:31] at Passover at what it meant for our
[40:34] opening scriptures while we stand in
[40:37] respect to the word.
[40:45] I keep trying.
[40:48] There we go.
[40:51] Exodus 1. And the Egyptians made the
[40:55] children of Israel to serve with rigor.
[40:57] Made them slaves. worked them
[40:59] relentlessly.
[41:01] And the Egyptians made their lives
[41:02] bitter with hard bondage and mortar
[41:06] digging clay and in brick and in all
[41:09] manner of service in the field. All
[41:11] their service, all their toil, their
[41:14] harsh service wherein the Egyptians made
[41:16] them serve was with rigor, harshness,
[41:21] severity,
[41:22] without mercy.
[41:24] God then raised up Moses to deliver his
[41:28] people from bondage, from slavery.
[41:31] Exodus 12 tells of the Passover, the
[41:35] night when the Lord sent the 10th
[41:37] plague, the night that Pharaoh released
[41:40] the Israelite slaves. It was the night
[41:42] of the Passover when death struck the
[41:45] firstborn of Egypt. But the agent of
[41:47] death passed over the houses of the
[41:50] Israelites who had the blood of a
[41:53] sacrificial lamb displayed on the
[41:55] entrances of their dwellings.
[41:58] Moses instruct them to keep the Passover
[42:01] memorial feast of roasted lamb with
[42:03] bitter herbs and unleavened bread every
[42:06] year to commemorate their salvation.
[42:11] Moses said, "Ye shall observe this thing
[42:14] for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons
[42:17] forever. It shall come to pass when ye
[42:21] be come to the land which the Lord will
[42:23] give you, according as he hath promised,
[42:25] that ye shall keep this service, this
[42:28] remembrance of deliverance from
[42:31] bondage."
[42:32] And it shall come to pass when your
[42:35] children shall say to you, "What do you
[42:37] mean by this service? What? What? What's
[42:40] going on here? That ye shall say, "It is
[42:44] the sacrifice of the Lord's Passover,
[42:46] who passed over the houses of the
[42:48] children of Israel in Egypt, when he
[42:51] smoked the Egyptians and delivered our
[42:54] houses, and the people bowed the head
[42:57] and worshiped."
[42:59] Please be seated.
[43:04] observance of the Passover was to be an
[43:06] ordinance forever among the Jewish
[43:09] people and a very important one.
[43:14] H how important? Well, let's go now to
[43:17] the desert on the first anniversary of
[43:20] leaving Egypt to the first observance of
[43:24] Passover.
[43:26] And the Lord spake unto Moses in the
[43:29] wilderness of Si in the first month of
[43:31] the second year after they were come out
[43:33] of the land of Egypt, saying, "Let the
[43:36] children of Israel also keep the
[43:37] Passover at his appointed season. And
[43:40] the 14th day of this month at even, you
[43:43] shall keep it in his appointed season,
[43:46] according to all the rights of it, and
[43:48] according to all the ceremonies thereof
[43:51] shall ye keep it."
[43:53] And Moses spake unto the children of
[43:55] Israel that they should keep the
[43:57] Passover.
[43:59] And they kept the Passover on the 14th
[44:01] day of the first month at even in the
[44:05] wilderness of Si according to all that
[44:08] the Lord commanded Moses. So did the
[44:11] children of Israel.
[44:13] Their first month wasn't January. It's
[44:16] based on a lunar calendar. It variously
[44:17] falls on our calendar sometime in March
[44:19] and April.
[44:21] But there was a problem.
[44:24] a conflict in the laws that had been
[44:26] given since the departure from Egypt.
[44:30] There were certain men who were defiled
[44:32] by the dead body of a man that they
[44:34] could not keep the Passover on that day.
[44:37] And they came before Moses and Aaron on
[44:40] that day. And these men said, "We're
[44:42] defiled. We're ceremonially unclean by
[44:46] the dead body of a man. We we touched
[44:48] his corpse perhaps by accident. perhaps
[44:52] checking for a pulse to see if he was
[44:54] alive, if they could help him. We don't
[44:56] know the reason why. Wherefore are we?
[45:00] Why must we be kept back that we may not
[45:02] offered an offering of the Lord in his
[45:04] appointed season, this time dicated for
[45:08] Passover observance among the children
[45:10] of Israel.
[45:12] This was all new. The concept of being
[45:16] unclean and what you can and cannot do.
[45:18] In many cases, becoming unclean meant
[45:21] that you washed yourself and became
[45:23] clean at sunset that evening. No
[45:25] conflict there. No problem. But not in
[45:29] this case. They'd come in contact with
[45:32] the dead body.
[45:34] Numbers 19 tells us, "He that touches
[45:37] the bo dead body of any man shall be
[45:39] unclean seven days."
[45:42] Seven days.
[45:44] They couldn't become ceremonially clean
[45:46] in time to observe Passover. If you keep
[45:49] one rule, you break the other. If you
[45:52] keep the other rule, you break the one.
[45:54] It's perhaps the original catch 22.
[46:00] Moses didn't know the answer. So he said
[46:02] unto them, "Stand still. I will hear
[46:04] what the Lord will command concerning
[46:07] you."
[46:09] And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
[46:11] "Speak unto the children of Israel,
[46:13] saying, If any man of you or of your
[46:16] posterity shall be unclean by reason of
[46:19] a dead body, or be in a journey a far
[46:21] off, yet he shall keep the Passover unto
[46:25] the Lord.
[46:27] On the 14th day of the second month, and
[46:30] even shall they keep it." In other
[46:33] words, if you're prevented from
[46:36] observing Passover on the 14th of the
[46:38] first month, you must observe it on the
[46:41] 14th day of the second month. This gives
[46:44] you time to become ceremonially clean or
[46:47] overcome some other serious hindrance to
[46:49] observing it in the first month. God
[46:51] made a way for them, a way for them to
[46:54] fulfill his word, just as he makes a way
[46:57] for us.
[47:00] They shall keep it and eat it with
[47:03] unleavened bread and bitter herbs. They
[47:06] shall not leave, they shall leave none
[47:08] of it unto the morning, nor break any
[47:11] bone of it, according to all the
[47:13] ordinances of the Passover, they shall
[47:15] keep it. But
[47:18] the man that is clean, not in a journey,
[47:21] and forebears to keep the Passover,
[47:23] there's not a legal conflict like these
[47:25] men had or other acceptable reason.
[47:28] someone chooses to not observe it on the
[47:31] day it's to be observed, even that same
[47:34] soul shall be what? Cut off from among
[47:39] his people because he brought not the
[47:42] offering of the Lord in his appointed
[47:43] season. That man shall bear his sin.
[47:48] Put another way, there's ultimately no
[47:51] acceptable excuse to refrain from
[47:53] observing it. Passover must be observed.
[47:57] And if a person does not observe it,
[48:00] they will be cut off from the community.
[48:02] Their sin will stand and they will bear
[48:05] the consequences of that sin.
[48:09] Observing Passover, it's a very serious
[48:12] business.
[48:15] Passover was a remembrance of the Lord
[48:18] freeing the people from bondage, from
[48:21] slavery to Egypt. and it identified the
[48:24] worshipper, the observer as as a member
[48:28] of that community so freed.
[48:31] Well, let's jump forward about 1500
[48:33] years.
[48:35] Jesus is at the synagogue at Capernaum.
[48:38] It's the day after the miracle of
[48:40] feeding the 5000.
[48:42] A crowd gathers, including many who had
[48:44] been fed the day before. Jesus is asked
[48:47] how they might work the works of God. In
[48:50] other words, how can we get free food
[48:53] like they had the day before? Like the
[48:55] children of Israel in the wilderness had
[48:57] 40 years getting free mana. We'd like to
[49:00] go on vacation. We'd like to take a
[49:02] break. We want free food.
[49:04] Well, Jesus addresses them. He uses the
[49:08] opportunity to speak about the man in
[49:10] the wilderness of Si
[49:12] and he ends by shocking them. We read in
[49:16] John 6:51,
[49:19] Jesus says, "I am the living bread which
[49:23] came down from heaven. If any man eat of
[49:26] this bread, he shall live forever. And
[49:30] the bread that I will give is my flesh,
[49:34] which I will give for the life of the
[49:37] world."
[49:38] The Jews, the gathered crowd, therefore
[49:40] quarreled among themselves, saying, "How
[49:42] can this man give us his flesh to eat?"
[49:46] And Jesus said unto them, "Verily,
[49:49] verily, I say unto you, except you eat
[49:52] the flesh of the Son of Man and drink
[49:56] his blood,
[49:58] you have no life in you. Who so eateth
[50:01] my flesh and drinkkeeth my blood hath
[50:03] eternal life, and I will raise him up at
[50:06] the last day.
[50:08] For my flesh is meat is food indeed, and
[50:13] my blood is drinkdeed. He that eateth my
[50:17] flesh and drinkkeeth my blood dwelleth
[50:20] in me, and I in him. As a living Father
[50:23] hath sent me, and I live by the Father,
[50:27] so he that eateth me shall live by me.
[50:33] Whoa. Whoa. What was the reaction?
[50:36] Skipping to verse 66. From that time,
[50:40] many of his disciples went back and
[50:41] walked no more with him. They weren't
[50:45] patient enough to let him explain or
[50:48] interpret what he meant.
[50:53] Brother Brandham reminded us that God
[50:55] interprets his word. How?
[50:59] Anyone?
[51:01] He interprets his word by bringing it to
[51:03] pass.
[51:07] So let's jump forward a few months from
[51:09] Capernaum to Jerusalem, from a synagogue
[51:12] to an upper room near the temple. See
[51:15] how Jesus interpreted his own words. The
[51:18] last night of Jesus' life was the night
[51:22] of observing Passover.
[51:25] In Luke 22, we read, "Then came the day
[51:29] of unleavened bread when the Passover
[51:32] must be killed." The killing of a lamb
[51:35] or kid, the worshipper identifying with
[51:38] the sacrifice. In Egypt, the family took
[51:41] in the sacrificial lamb on the 10th day
[51:43] and cared for it, nurtured it, bonded
[51:46] with it until the evening. And that
[51:49] evening of the 15th day, they sacrificed
[51:52] that that animal, the one that they had
[51:55] taken such care of.
[51:57] And Jesus sent Peter and John saying,
[52:00] "Go prepare us the Passover that we may
[52:03] eat." Pete gives them precise directions
[52:06] how to find the place, the guy that owns
[52:08] it, to make available what we call the
[52:10] upper room, skipping to verse 13. And
[52:14] they went and found, as Jesus had said
[52:17] unto them, and they made ready the
[52:19] Passover. Now, this is not a tasty meal
[52:22] to fill you up. It has bitter herbs and
[52:25] other foods to remind the partaker of
[52:27] the bitterness of the time in Egypt.
[52:31] And when the hour was come, sunset,
[52:35] Jesus sat down, and the twel apostles
[52:39] with him.
[52:41] And he said unto them
[52:44] with desire, I have desired to eat this
[52:46] Passover with you before I suffer. For I
[52:49] say unto you, I will not eat anymore
[52:52] thereof until it be fulfilled in the
[52:54] kingdom of God." And he took the cup and
[52:57] gave thanks and said, "Take this, divide
[53:00] it among yourselves, for I say unto you,
[53:02] I will not drink of the fruit of the
[53:04] vine until the kingdom of God shall
[53:05] come."
[53:07] Today, modern Passover observance, there
[53:11] are four cups of wine shared in the
[53:13] traditional observance, certain
[53:14] blessings or prayers associated with
[53:16] each.
[53:19] Now, recall what we read just a couple
[53:22] of minutes ago, John 6:53 about Jesus
[53:25] being the bread of life. Jesus said unto
[53:28] them, "Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[53:32] except you eat the flesh of the Son of
[53:34] Man and drink his blood, you have no
[53:36] life in you."
[53:39] He's now going to interpret, explain the
[53:42] meaning, not about being cannibals.
[53:44] Continuing in Luke 22.
[53:48] And he took bread and gave thanks and
[53:52] broke it
[53:55] and gave it unto them, saying, "This is
[53:59] what?" My body. This is what I meant by
[54:02] eating my flesh. This is a symbol
[54:04] representing my body which is given for
[54:07] you. This do in remembrance of me.
[54:12] in remembrance of me. What? We'll get to
[54:17] this in a moment. Likewise also the cup
[54:19] after supper, saying, "This cup is the
[54:23] new testament, the new covenant in my
[54:25] blood, which is shed for you."
[54:29] This is the symbol of drinking my blood.
[54:34] In Egypt, the first Passover, each
[54:36] family took care of that sacrificial
[54:38] lamb for five days, bonding at some
[54:40] level with it. Here Jesus is together
[54:43] with his disciples having walked with
[54:46] them, ministered with them, having
[54:48] bonded with them.
[54:50] The observance of Passover was in
[54:53] remembrance of the Lord delivering his
[54:56] people from being enslaved to Pharaoh
[55:00] through the sacrifice of the very lamb
[55:02] they had taken care of which would give
[55:04] its life for theirs.
[55:06] Jesus is now saying this observance is
[55:10] to be in remembrance of the Lord
[55:12] delivering his people from being
[55:14] enslaved to sin
[55:17] through his own sacrifice giving his
[55:21] life for theirs for hours.
[55:26] Why in remembrance? He's sitting there
[55:29] with them.
[55:31] He'd been telling his disciples over and
[55:33] over this was his last visit to
[55:35] Jerusalem, that he would be killed
[55:37] there. He's reinforcing that on what he
[55:41] knew would be his last night with them.
[55:48] In the early church, there was confusion
[55:51] about many things. Paul's earliest
[55:53] letters include First Corinthians.
[55:56] In this letter, Paul addressed
[55:58] communion.
[56:00] This tells us communion was a practice
[56:03] of Christians in these first gentile
[56:06] churches, not just something for Jewish
[56:08] Christians observing Passover.
[56:13] 1 Corinthians 10, Paul writes, "The cup
[56:16] of blessing which we bless, is it not
[56:19] the communion of the blood of Christ,
[56:22] the the bread which we break?
[56:26] Is it not the communion of the body of
[56:29] Christ?
[56:30] For we being many are one bread and one
[56:35] body. For we are all partakers of that
[56:40] one bread.
[56:42] Later in 1 Corinthians 11, which will be
[56:45] read this evening when we participate in
[56:47] communion, you'll find the only time
[56:50] Paul quotes Jesus in any of his writings
[56:53] in the New Testament. By that I mean the
[56:56] only words in red if you have a red
[56:58] letter edition of the text. And those
[57:00] words, those only words
[57:04] are about communion
[57:08] from his last night with his disciples.
[57:12] What does the word communion mean?
[57:17] I keep telling you to sit closer to the
[57:19] front, but that's okay. I'm not going to
[57:22] read that to you. In English, the word
[57:25] is used to reflect what we will be doing
[57:28] later this evening. It also has meanings
[57:31] of sharing,
[57:33] community,
[57:35] agreement,
[57:36] fellowship,
[57:38] participation,
[57:40] and these are all attributes consistent
[57:43] with our practice of communion.
[57:46] But Paul didn't write in English. Paul
[57:49] wrote in Greek in particular the Greek
[57:52] of his time two millennia ago.
[57:55] What word did he use and what was its
[57:58] meaning in that time and that context?
[58:04] The root of the word is konos. Coonos it
[58:09] means a sharer or associate, companion,
[58:13] partaker, partner and fellowship. The
[58:17] actual word Paul used which is built on
[58:20] this root
[58:22] konos is
[58:25] konia
[58:28] partnership
[58:30] literally participation socially
[58:33] intercourse pecuniary which means
[58:35] financial or monetary benefaction to
[58:38] communicate communication communion
[58:41] contribution distribution
[58:44] fellowship
[58:47] This word konia
[58:50] appears 20 times in 18 verses in the New
[58:55] Testament. 12 times it's translated as
[58:59] fellowship.
[59:01] Four times it's translated as communion.
[59:05] And all four of those are in the letters
[59:07] to the Corinthians. And it's translated
[59:10] once each time to mean contribution,
[59:13] distribution, communication
[59:16] or communicate.
[59:18] Communion.
[59:20] You can see this is a word tightly
[59:22] connected with the concept of
[59:24] individuals participating
[59:26] as part of a community.
[59:30] You don't in fact you cannot do any of
[59:33] this in isolation.
[59:36] You don't partner with yourself or have
[59:38] fellowship with yourself. You can't
[59:41] participate in communion by yourself.
[59:46] The offering that Paul took for the
[59:47] believers in Jerusalem was called
[59:51] Coonia.
[59:53] I think of the offering collected here
[59:54] the Sunday before Christmas. I think
[59:57] Paul would have called both that
[59:58] collection and its distribution coonia.
[1:00:03] The same word he would use to describe
[1:00:05] the sacrament, fulfilling an ordinance,
[1:00:08] celebration or observance we're about to
[1:00:10] do this evening.
[1:00:12] Communion
[1:00:14] coonia
[1:00:16] and remembrance of Jesus of his
[1:00:20] sacrificial death to free us from
[1:00:23] slavery to sin
[1:00:25] to enable us give us the freedom to make
[1:00:29] a choice to serve him.
[1:00:33] Brother Brandham's final service here in
[1:00:35] Tucson in 1965 was communion. And his
[1:00:40] remarks that evening, he said, "Except
[1:00:43] you eat the flesh of the son of man and
[1:00:45] drink his blood, you have no life in
[1:00:47] you." He he's quoting John 6:53, which
[1:00:49] we read earlier. See, you see, that's
[1:00:52] what the Bible said. Except you do it
[1:00:55] participating in communion, there's no
[1:00:58] life. You see, you are then more or less
[1:01:01] showing you are ashamed to identify
[1:01:04] yourself as a Christian because of the
[1:01:07] life that you live. And then this is
[1:01:10] really the showdown.
[1:01:12] If you don't do it, you have no life.
[1:01:17] If you do it unworthily,
[1:01:19] you're guilty of the body of the Lord.
[1:01:23] Here again, we see you can't identify
[1:01:25] yourself as a Christian by yourself.
[1:01:28] It's not just you and the mirror or to
[1:01:30] yourself in isolation. It's a community
[1:01:34] act, a public confession of your
[1:01:37] identity as a Christian. And like
[1:01:41] Passover in the Old Testament, communion
[1:01:45] is a serious matter.
[1:01:48] Brother Daniel's been teaching from the
[1:01:49] sermon on the mount where where Jesus
[1:01:51] took the words of the law and
[1:01:53] effectively amplified them making
[1:01:55] thoughts intense as important as
[1:01:58] actions.
[1:02:00] Paul would amplify the meaning of
[1:02:02] Passover in communion. With the
[1:02:05] Passover, not doing it separated you
[1:02:07] from the community. But Paul indicates
[1:02:10] that with communion, you are also guilty
[1:02:13] if you take it but do so unworthily.
[1:02:17] 1 Corinthians 11:29, "He that eateth and
[1:02:20] drinkkeeth unworthily eateth and
[1:02:23] drinkketh damnation to himself, not
[1:02:24] discerning the Lord's body."
[1:02:28] What does unworthily mean?
[1:02:31] Some take it as meaning that they've
[1:02:33] committed a sin, some sin in their past,
[1:02:36] it's so bad that they're barred or they
[1:02:39] bar themselves from communion. I'm not
[1:02:42] worthy to take it. I did fill in the
[1:02:45] blank. That's not what it means. The
[1:02:48] Amplified Bible Translation helps to
[1:02:50] clarify this. Anyone who eats and drinks
[1:02:54] without discriminating and recognizing
[1:02:57] with due appreciation that it is
[1:03:00] Christ's body eats and drinks a sentence
[1:03:03] of verdict of judgment upon himself.
[1:03:06] In other words, it goes back to John 6
[1:03:10] and Luke 22. not a doctrine of
[1:03:13] transubstantiation where the elements of
[1:03:15] communion somehow become human flesh and
[1:03:17] human blood, but that they are symbols
[1:03:19] that represent his body as if they were
[1:03:22] his flesh and blood.
[1:03:26] During communion, we're not just
[1:03:28] casually eating a bit of bread and
[1:03:31] taking a sip of wine. What we are doing
[1:03:34] is done in remembrance of him, of his
[1:03:38] sacrifice that atones for our sins.
[1:03:42] It's not about the elements, the
[1:03:45] symbols. It's entirely about him. We are
[1:03:49] partaking
[1:03:50] of him.
[1:03:54] Note again that coonia, the the word for
[1:03:58] communion is most often translated as
[1:04:00] fellowship.
[1:04:02] community.
[1:04:04] The early church had all things in
[1:04:06] common. We're told the the word
[1:04:07] translated as common is also one of the
[1:04:10] roots of coonia.
[1:04:12] In Acts 2, just after Peter's famous
[1:04:14] sermon about faith and baptism, we read
[1:04:17] in verse 42.
[1:04:19] And they the the newly baptized
[1:04:21] believers continued steadfastly in the
[1:04:23] apostles doctrine in fellowship. The
[1:04:26] word fellowship here is coonia.
[1:04:29] and in breaking of bread and in prayers.
[1:04:34] Verse 44, all that believed were
[1:04:36] together and had all things common.
[1:04:39] Again, one of the roots. Verse 46, they
[1:04:43] continuing daily with one accord in the
[1:04:46] temple and breaking bread from house to
[1:04:49] house did eat their meat with gladness
[1:04:52] and singleness of heart.
[1:04:55] Community
[1:04:57] has another aspect,
[1:04:59] a common or shared unity.
[1:05:02] We read that they were in daily
[1:05:04] fellowship and of one accord,
[1:05:08] singleness of heart.
[1:05:10] And and much like we find the word and
[1:05:13] concept of unity and community communion
[1:05:18] contains the word union
[1:05:21] and the concept
[1:05:24] we are individuals
[1:05:26] joined together in and with Christ as
[1:05:30] fellowship
[1:05:32] as part of his body. Our individual
[1:05:35] actions reflect not just on ourselves
[1:05:38] but on our community, our portion of the
[1:05:42] body of Christ. I invite the worship
[1:05:45] team to to please return.
[1:05:48] Unity like union does not mean
[1:05:52] uniformity,
[1:05:54] but it does mean lack of division. Paul
[1:05:57] scolds the Corinthians about divisions
[1:05:59] among them. Before coming to the
[1:06:02] communion table, Paul admonishes us,
[1:06:05] "Let a man examine himself,
[1:06:08] and so let him eat that bread and drink
[1:06:10] of that cup."
[1:06:12] In Paul's time, a person being examined
[1:06:15] would often be beaten or worse, to
[1:06:18] extract truth or confession.
[1:06:21] Self-examination
[1:06:23] isn't just being quiet for 30 seconds.
[1:06:26] It's serious.
[1:06:28] Have to be careful. have to be honest
[1:06:31] with ourselves.
[1:06:33] John tells us if we confess our sins,
[1:06:36] he's faithful and just to forgive.
[1:06:41] And thinking and praying about a a
[1:06:42] closing song to pass the service over to
[1:06:45] our pastor, my thoughts turned to a hymn
[1:06:47] written in 1835
[1:06:49] by a lady named Charlotte Elliott. Three
[1:06:53] of its verses really resonated with me
[1:06:55] in this context. So let's sing together
[1:06:59] quietly, reverently,
[1:07:02] just as I am.
[1:07:08] Just as I am
[1:07:13] without
[1:07:14] one plea,
[1:07:17] but that thy blood
[1:07:21] was shed for me
[1:07:25] and that
[1:07:27] thou bit me. Come to thee,
[1:07:33] oh lamb
[1:07:36] of God. I come.
[1:07:40] I
[1:07:42] come.
[1:07:46] Just as I am, though tossed about
[1:07:54] with many affect
[1:07:59] many a
[1:08:03] fightings and fears within
[1:08:08] without.
[1:08:10] Oh lamb of God, I come.
[1:08:16] I
[1:08:18] come
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; just as I am. Thou wil pree
[1:08:29] will dwell
[1:08:34] cleanse
[1:08:37] because
[1:08:39] thy promise
[1:08:42] I believe.
[1:08:45] Oh lamb of God
[1:08:49] I come.
[1:08:52] I
[1:08:53] come
[1:09:02] as old as we
[1:09:04] get. And whether we be uh 20 years old
[1:09:11] or like me in my 50s or 60, 70, 80 years
[1:09:15] old, whatever we might be,
[1:09:18] we should always be willing to learn.
[1:09:21] I always be willing
[1:09:24] to question, did I fully understand
[1:09:29] what I've always thought?
[1:09:31] And I I appreciate brother Lyall and um
[1:09:34] he said some things tonight and back
[1:09:37] them up well with scriptures that is
[1:09:41] going to make me go back
[1:09:45] and ask the Lord and and study further.
[1:09:48] Do I truly do I truly understand?
[1:09:54] The was in
[1:09:56] 1 Corinthians chapter 11
[1:10:03] and it this was the Apostle Paul as he
[1:10:06] said
[1:10:07] and this is
[1:10:09] him
[1:10:11] quoting our Lord Jesus in in verses 24
[1:10:14] and 25.
[1:10:17] And I will read what he said.
[1:10:22] The Apostle Paul says, "For I have
[1:10:23] received of the Lord
[1:10:26] that
[1:10:28] which also I delivered unto you that the
[1:10:30] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[1:10:33] was betrayed took bread.
[1:10:36] And when he had given thanks, he broke
[1:10:39] it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body
[1:10:44] which is broken for you. This do in
[1:10:47] remembrance of me. And after the same
[1:10:50] manner also he took the cup and when he
[1:10:53] had sucked, saying, this is the new
[1:10:57] testament. This cup is the new testament
[1:10:59] in my blood.
[1:11:01] This do ye as oft as you drink it in
[1:11:06] remembrance of me.
[1:11:10] For as often as you eat this bread and
[1:11:14] drink this cup, you do show the Lord's
[1:11:17] death till he come.
[1:11:22] Next verse, verse number 27,
[1:11:25] it says this, "Wherefore, whosoever
[1:11:28] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:11:31] of the Lord unworthily
[1:11:34] shall be guilty of the body and the
[1:11:37] blood of the Lord.
[1:11:40] Now verse number 27 as brother Lyle
[1:11:42] pointed out if you have a Scoffield
[1:11:44] Bible there's a note in the margin
[1:11:49] and this says this
[1:11:52] for that word unworthily.
[1:11:57] I'll read it again so it's on your mind
[1:11:58] and drink of this cup
[1:12:01] of the Lord unworthily
[1:12:03] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:12:05] the Lord. The note in the Scoffield
[1:12:08] Bible says this. For example,
[1:12:12] in an unworthy manner,
[1:12:16] eating eating taking this communion in
[1:12:19] an unworthy manner,
[1:12:23] but let a man examine himself,
[1:12:29] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:12:32] drink of that cup.
[1:12:34] For he that eateth and drinkketh
[1:12:36] unworthily eateth and drinking
[1:12:38] drinkkeeth damnation to himself, not
[1:12:41] discerning the Lord's body.
[1:12:44] For this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:12:46] among you, and many sleep.
[1:12:50] For if we would judge ourselves,
[1:12:54] we should not be judged.
[1:12:58] But when we are judged, we are chasened
[1:13:02] of the Lord that we should not be
[1:13:05] condemned with the world. And brothers
[1:13:09] would come forward.
[1:13:28] as bread
[1:13:34] 2,000 years now. Well, since really the
[1:13:37] Passover, for over 3,000 years,
[1:13:43] the tradition has been to take unleaven
[1:13:46] bread and and to break it
[1:13:50] and to fellowship over this. And then
[1:13:52] for 2,000 years since Jesus took that
[1:13:55] Passover
[1:13:57] and he broke the bread
[1:14:00] and then he said, "This represents me.
[1:14:07] This is my flesh."
[1:14:10] It's not his literal flesh.
[1:14:13] This represents him.
[1:14:16] The body that's broken. And if you look
[1:14:18] when you take a piece when when the
[1:14:21] deacons serve you this bread,
[1:14:25] it's broken and and none of the pieces
[1:14:28] look the same.
[1:14:31] And that's how the body of Christ is.
[1:14:34] We're all different
[1:14:37] because God has Jesus has broken himself
[1:14:41] up,
[1:14:43] placed each of us into this body. And
[1:14:46] when you take a piece, just remember
[1:14:48] they're all different, but this one
[1:14:51] piece is the piece that you are taking.
[1:14:53] And and it represents him. It represents
[1:14:56] our Lord Jesus.
[1:14:59] Lord,
[1:15:03] it's a bit overwhelming.
[1:15:07] Think of what
[1:15:09] this bread that I'm holding in my hands
[1:15:11] represents.
[1:15:15] Lord,
[1:15:17] we want to remember you all the time.
[1:15:21] There is something special about this
[1:15:24] evening.
[1:15:27] And Lord, we do it under your
[1:15:28] commandment
[1:15:30] and we take this bread in remembrance of
[1:15:32] you.
[1:15:35] Lord, it shook me a bit what brother La
[1:15:39] was saying and
[1:15:42] understanding this word.
[1:15:45] and we want to do what we're doing this
[1:15:47] evening. We want to do it right.
[1:15:52] Father,
[1:15:53] we're doing the best that we know how
[1:15:55] and taking this and
[1:15:58] and Lord, we want you to bless it.
[1:16:02] We ask that that your spirit, Father,
[1:16:05] would come down.
[1:16:08] And as each person takes a piece of this
[1:16:11] bread and puts it, Lord, into their
[1:16:14] mouth,
[1:16:16] may we truly remember you, oh God.
[1:16:21] Truly remember the sacrifice
[1:16:24] that you made for us. Truly remember the
[1:16:26] life that you lived.
[1:16:29] Truly remember the words that you taught
[1:16:31] us.
[1:16:34] Lord, may your blessings rest upon this
[1:16:37] bread in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:16:48] The bread
[1:16:52] represents the body, the broken body of
[1:16:54] our Lord Jesus. Body that was hung on
[1:16:57] the cross.
[1:16:59] And this blood
[1:17:02] represents the sin cleansing power
[1:17:06] of the shed blood of our Lord Jesus.
[1:17:11] I look down, I I see these these
[1:17:14] individual cups of of wine
[1:17:18] and
[1:17:21] it represents something that's far
[1:17:23] greater than us.
[1:17:25] That this is my salvation, brother.
[1:17:30] This represents that and what he did for
[1:17:33] me.
[1:17:40] Lord God, it's uh
[1:17:43] it's almost hard to pick up this wine,
[1:17:45] Lord, knowing what it represents.
[1:17:49] My mind goes back to Calvary and and
[1:17:52] Father, that blood dripping down off the
[1:17:53] cross
[1:17:56] and what it represented.
[1:17:59] And Lord, just a few days earlier,
[1:18:02] just a day earlier,
[1:18:05] the Lord spoke these words that were the
[1:18:07] Lyall read and that I read
[1:18:10] that this is my blood.
[1:18:15] Oh God,
[1:18:17] thank you that we can do this.
[1:18:20] Father, I pray that
[1:18:23] that your blessings would represent
[1:18:24] would rest upon this wine.
[1:18:29] And Lord, may we take it worthily, Lord,
[1:18:32] understanding
[1:18:34] the shed blood of our Lord Jesus.
[1:18:37] In Jesus name we pray.
[1:18:40] Amen.
[1:18:48] Come forward. Thank you.
[1:25:35] The remainder of the bread.
[1:25:38] that hasn't been consumed
[1:25:40] during the Lord's supper will be burned
[1:25:44] before the dawn of another day and
[1:25:46] tradition
[1:25:48] as the mana spoiled overnight
[1:25:52] in this representing the body of our
[1:25:55] Lord Jesus out of respect.
[1:26:04] John
[1:26:06] chapter 13
[1:26:08] verse number two
[1:26:12] and this will close service. And supper
[1:26:14] being ended,
[1:26:16] the devil having now put into the heart
[1:26:18] of Judas's chariot,
[1:26:21] Simon's son, to betray him. Jesus
[1:26:24] knowing that the father had given all
[1:26:25] things into his hand and that he was
[1:26:29] come from God and he went to God.
[1:26:33] He riseth from supper and laid aside his
[1:26:35] garments and took a towel and gerted
[1:26:37] himself. After he had pour after that he
[1:26:40] pou water into a basin and began to wash
[1:26:44] the disciples feet and to wipe them with
[1:26:46] a towel wherewith he was girded.
[1:26:50] Then cometh he to Simon Peter. And Peter
[1:26:53] saith unto him, Lord, dust thou wash my
[1:26:57] feet? And Jesus answered and saith un
[1:27:00] and said unto him, What I do,
[1:27:04] thou knowest not now, but thou shalt
[1:27:06] know hereafter.
[1:27:08] Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never
[1:27:11] wash my feet.
[1:27:14] Jesus answered him, If I wash thee
[1:27:17] night, if I wash thee not, thou hast no
[1:27:19] part with me.
[1:27:22] Simon Peter saith unto him,"Lord, not my
[1:27:26] feet only, but also my hands and my
[1:27:28] head." Jesus saith unto him, "He that is
[1:27:32] washed need not saved to wash his feet,
[1:27:36] but is clean ever wit, and you are
[1:27:39] clean, but not all." For he knew who
[1:27:42] should betray him. Therefore said he,
[1:27:46] you're not all clean."
[1:27:49] So after he had washed their feet and
[1:27:51] and taken his garments and was set down
[1:27:54] again, he said unto them,
[1:27:58] "Know ye what I have done to you. You
[1:28:01] call me Master and Lord, and you say
[1:28:04] well, for so I am.
[1:28:07] If I then, your Lord and Master, have
[1:28:10] washed your feet, ye also ought to wash
[1:28:13] one another's feet. For I have given you
[1:28:17] an example that you should do as I
[1:28:21] have done to you. Verily, verily, I say
[1:28:25] unto you, the servant is not greater
[1:28:28] than his Lord, neither he that is sent
[1:28:31] greater than he that sent him.
[1:28:36] If you know these things,
[1:28:39] happy are ye if you do them.
[1:28:42] Amen. Brother Mark Oh, are you could you
[1:28:45] come and close in prayer?
[1:28:48] Friends, I do appreciate
[1:28:51] communion.
[1:28:53] I appreciate that we can come together
[1:28:56] and honor
[1:28:58] the the Lord's body as we have done and
[1:29:01] come together as as we heard earlier in
[1:29:05] communion and and much of the meaning
[1:29:07] behind communion is fellowship,
[1:29:10] coming together and doing these things.
[1:29:12] believe there's love in this room.
[1:29:16] And we have gone now to the feetashing
[1:29:21] portion of this. And this friends, we do
[1:29:25] in love as a service to one another.
[1:29:29] Let's all stand. Brother Mark, if you
[1:29:32] would come and close.
[1:29:37] Dear heavenly father, it's such a
[1:29:38] privilege to be able to even come to you
[1:29:40] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Through the way that you have made, the
[1:29:45] way that you provided, Lord, your your
[1:29:48] precious saints here before me that you
[1:29:51] you redeemed with your own blood.
[1:29:54] Lord, salvation of souls is not cheap.
[1:29:57] Very expensive.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Cost the greatest cost that could ever
[1:30:02] be paid. And that just shows the love,
[1:30:05] Lord, that you have for your people.
[1:30:08] Thank you for calling us, Lord.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you for giving us an opportunity
[1:30:12] to come and eat at your table and
[1:30:14] fellowship in your future kingdom. These
[1:30:17] are just all great attributes of your
[1:30:20] wonderful grace, Lord. We take it
[1:30:22] seriously. We take it gratefully, Lord.
[1:30:26] And I just pray a blessing upon this
[1:30:29] church, this pastor, this people. Lord,
[1:30:32] give them a mission and a calling to be
[1:30:36] a light of that grace.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; In this area where you placed them,
[1:30:40] Lord, may your spirit anoint them for
[1:30:42] that service, Lord. Even as we now serve
[1:30:46] one another in the footwashing, we thank
[1:30:48] you so much, Lord, for the service and
[1:30:50] the time together in the presence of
[1:30:52] your spirit in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:59] Amen.
[1:31:01] Feels
[1:31:02] good, friends.
[1:31:05] Feels good to to do what we've done
[1:31:07] tonight. I I love what everything
[1:31:10] represents. And then I love the thought
[1:31:13] of being together with fellows, fellow
[1:31:15] disciples of our Lord Jesus. The sisters
[1:31:20] will go into the fellowship hall and
[1:31:22] then the brothers will go up into our
[1:31:25] normal place and uh we'll we'll go up
[1:31:27] the stairs there. God bless you. May the
[1:31:30] Lord be with you. You're dismissed.
