a little bit late this morning because there was an accident on the freeway which had just happened so we probably got about a 20-minute delay coming in and my wife made a statement she said you know for all the times we've come down the freeway god's been good to us we had one flat tire years ago and that's been also remembering those that that are traveling and things so brother julio if we'll stand would you would you come and open in prayer brother julio [Music] i know the lord has made a way he continues to make a way in fact he's already seen the end and in his mind in his thoughts it's finished so amen thank you brother let's all pray together dear heavenly father we're just so thankful lord that with all the chaos in this world lord you're watching over us lord there's nothing to fear lord and we thank you for it lord we ask you to be with us this morning receive our praises and song lord heal the ones that are sick lord be with the ones that couldn't be here lord watch over them also we ask you to bless the service bless the word in jesus christ's name amen [Music] amen brother jeremy would you put psalms 95 uh verse 6 up and i left a note on the desk turn around smile bump elbows wave however you want to do it i'm going to go get that note [Music] ah psalms 95 verse 6 oh come let us worship and bow down let us kneel before the lord our maker amen that was the scripture of the day this morning and i looked at it in the song oh come let us adore him that's why we've come this morning to give him honor give him glory because he's worthy [Music] [Music] oh

[Music] my i'm going to praise [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign amen you may be seated he's worthy of all praise that song all is well all is well even as a brother julia was praying he said in this chaotic time and when everything just seems so backward all is well there's something that settles down in your heart says it's okay [Music] [Music] oh there is a place [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] is the lord as they play that why don't you just thank your worship [Music] oh there is a place behind this if it's not well with you right now ask them to make it well to give you that assurance in your life that all is well amen i'm going to read you something here that i read last night and it's it's a little bit funny but it really drives the point it it reminds told me all is well on a sunday morning and it it is a listed as a southern church and you'll understand why here the new pastor called them one of the elder deacons to open the service in prayer the elder deacon stood up about his head and said lord i don't like buttermilk asked the pastor opened one eye and wondered where this was going the deacon continues the lord and i don't like lord either now the pastor was a little perplexed the deacon continued lord i don't care much for plain flour either but after you mix them all up and bake them in a hot oven i sure love them biscuits yeah and this was in lord help us to realize that when life gets hard things come up that we don't like or whenever we don't understand what you are doing that we need to wait and see what you are making after you get through mixing and baking i am sure it will be something a whole lot better than biscuits that spoke to me last night in this situation in new orleans it was a light way to put it but lord let me just rest in you because what you're doing and what you're working the end result is exactly what you planned and promised and said you would do so again all is well we have heard the message shalom we have heard the message [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this is what happens when you come running in at the last moment i left something else on the desk over there brother ed i left the prayer request sitting on there too we sat there and you know your first reaction is oh no i'm going to be late oh no i'm going to be delayed there's an accident or whatever then you get to the scene of the acts and you go oh lord have mercy on them when you see the situation the truck was was literally destroyed and the car was in bad shape and the ambulances had left already with the folks in them i'm sure and but you just you have to stop and say lord have mercy on them you've been good to us but have mercy on them i did get a prayer request just sent to me right before i walked in and let me read it to you [Music] brother david williamson said a friend just requested prayer her niece danielle in north carolina she is pregnant expecting in october she is bleeding and an emergency room now waiting to be examined he said will you please pray that all will be well with her and the baby so you know it's something that that's why we're here for someone it's not they're not there well maybe they're in my bible okay we should open the bible up a little more maybe i thought i had put him there but [Music] we we sometimes we forget sometimes we get busy sometimes we get in a hurry until something comes up and it catches our attention and we stop for a moment say lord lord first of all thank you for watching over us and we commit ourselves completely over to you so sister amelia says please pray for me i started having dizziness and i almost fell at the a couple of times so remember our sister amelia there so brother robert circonas sees brother robert has a doctor's appointment with the clinic i just pray that all will go well for me he says thank you for praying for me amen 8 o'clock on thursday so we'll do that [Music] brother ed dougla mentioned to me that tuesday they're going to be out of town working they're going to be rotating in and out of town but going out to bullhead city area for approximately two months so they'll be driving and working and i told him he's going to have to come back to tucson to cool off a little bit because it's really hot in bullhead city and then those of you that have heard or maybe saw on the prayer request for sister adriana murray she has found positive with the covid and so let's remember all the family and the children brother paul those that around and you know there's nothing too hard for the lord my father was telling me there's a brother that down in embodiment which is close to wymas mexico and good friends of my dad and they live up in phoenix now but his son had crossed back into mexico and was not allowed to return and now he has covered and also his mother works in his school dad worked for the for the train company and i believe it there he said the two of the brothers were doctors and he reported to him that every single day their report reporting or telling them two more people we know passed away with code and so it's not something we take lightly the jimenez family in in california good friends of ours the two daughters and dad have now passed away and they don't expect mom to live through and there was a they forwarded us a little news thing that one of the brothers went to the news and they featured the family and and you you stop and you think about it how could someone go through something like this but when there's an assurance in your heart and a peace then there's a way to get through it so let's stand [Music] we every day that we're out every day that wherever we are there is danger around us but he said he would hedge us he said he would he would keep us so that's our confidence i know my wife goes back to work starting tomorrow they're still unsure of how it's going to go she may be able to work out of the house and that's what we're asking the lord that she could stay home and just answer phone calls and things like that but there is no fear in perfect love and the god of perfect love lives in you when he lives in me how many believes that how many how many claims that saying yes lord i yield to you i surrender to you let's pray lord you you've heard the request and in a time of such confusion and and anger and things that are happening today and people don't even know how to express it lord and many things are happening and but there's a people a people of god lord that have a peace in their heart there's an assurance in their lives lord that all is well and though the skin worms would destroy this body they would buried in a grave yet these eyes shall behold we shall be holy lord we're trusting in that lord but we have a promise of healing we have a blessed assurance in our life lord every request that was written every heart every need in every heart today lord we just hold it up before you lord and we trust in you and believe in you lord in jesus christ's name amen amen it is well with my soul it is well oh it is with my soul [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] is is [Music] now

soul [Music] [Music] thank you lord jesus for making [Music] we love you for it in jesus christ's name amen you may be seated brother jordan you're going to probably have to wave or stand up because i can barely see you back there so brother matt we're going to have a visiting our special speaker this morning and brother matt's going to introduce him so but you love the lord jesus with all your heart yes you love him because he first love you i love him i love him because he first loved me and [Music] on please just tell them one more time [Music] first lovely [Music] [Applause] [Music] is

song praising myself this is [Music] [Music] and he'll be introducing our brother god god bless you friends i trust that this is coming through today good for you and clear good morning i greet you in the name of the lord i'm excited amen to be worshiping the lord today amen i believe he has something very special for us my audio i'm sure isn't very good right now don't worry about that i'm using the camera's microphone so i just trust you can hear me okay uh during the preaching it'll get a lot better when brother dig starts to minister he has the lapel microphone amen and so today we're just making do with what we have but we are excited to be here you cannot you can stand to your feet if you're seated there you can all stand with me now musicians could just continue to play something there for us amen appreciated that worship and that we were worshiping with you here amen in spirit and and i'm so glad that that's how we're connected today that god doesn't need uh brother branham said we've said it many times brother branham said that distance means nothing to god and in fact he goes further to say some of his greatest victories have been on telephone praying for someone over telephone because god is everywhere he's omniscient he's ubiquitous people think that 5g is ubiquitous going to be everywhere well uh they they've already missed that god's already one step ahead of him he's already he's always been everywhere he's all aware he's everywhere at all times amen and he and i believe that he sees us today amen we uh we appreciated amen the service last sunday night from brother lyle we wanna can he's going to continue that here today you know as he spoke last sunday and and uh said it was i think at the end of his service he said it was much like watching concrete dry and i'm sure uh that made me laugh uh but i appreciated it greatly i appreciated uh you know just the astuteness of our brother amen to come into such an angle with teaching amen and i believe that we should be grounded we live in an information age uh you know the battles that i'm facing the battles that your children my children are facing are very different than than what you faced as a teenager than what i faced as a teenager especially some of them we live in the information age it's the dawning of the internet amen where everybody just takes google as the gospel truth and whatever they google they go with and if they don't believe that then they believe a college professor amen and so uh i i just wanted to say that i appreciated that last sunday night i'm really looking forward to the lyle said he's he's got something upon his heart and made a personal testimony there so i'm excited for that you know when i i begin to think it you know we've i i knew a couple brothers actually uh one very close to me in our assembly who was in college served the lord his whole life went off to college pharmaceutical uh degree and and just had some mix up with the professor and you know some of the things that he presented about the reliability of the bible shook the brothers faith and uh had it not been for god supernaturally getting the hold of him i don't know where he'd be today and i i thought of that as hearing by the law i thought you know maybe uh the the you know maybe in your life you can't relate maybe you would just say well it's never been a question for me i don't need to i don't need any kind of proof like that i don't need to look at egyptology well that may be true for you but it's not true for everybody god has brother branham said it this way he said god will meet you at whatever if you know just because your mind doesn't think that way doesn't mean that satan doesn't have a trap laid up for somebody somewhere uh and and and and the devil knows that brother branham said that satan studies you he knows your nature he knows your makeup he knows how you're built and so he knows how to attack you he knows your weaknesses and i begin to think you know that maybe the brother had you know teaching like a brother loud gave and you know that was specific on brother lyle's heart was for those teenage young people who were maybe in college especially you know and would face this age of criticism and skepticism amen and so i'm so glad you know we don't need if science says that god doesn't exist that doesn't shake my faith i don't need that proof but it's good to know amen as paul said we haven't believed cunningly devised fables and if you turn that up for me brother dick just so it turns off there just press up on the arrow had the ac kick on amen so i appreciated that a lot i'm looking forward to tonight i appreciate it brother aaron's sermon i got to stream it uh live and it just really was an encouragement to me amen and i appreciate one of the quotes he read about preparedness of how god is if god has prepared and said i go and prepare a place uh you know that where i am you may be also if god's prepared and put that much forethought into the entire world here before here and after then why should we be concerned amen that he doesn't take care of us on a day-to-day basis so we're thankful for that amen and and i uh i'm just full of joy this morning amen i trust that you came with an expectation uh we already had the prayer request read for sister adriana murray there who's been diagnosed with covet and so that was out on the whatsapp chat if you didn't get that so we're standing with our sister uh we we believe by faith this is no different than the flu then a headache it's a bodily sickness amen and god the bible says that he hasn't given us the spirit of fear but of power and of a sound mind i encouraged you uh through the whatsapp chat and i trust that you got that it was real just the lord just put it upon my heart you know brother branham said take your token and he said ins what is that token it's not a doctrine it's not the message it's not brother branham certainly not uh it's not a it's not an idea it's not a picture it's nothing substantive it's a person the token is the person of the holy ghost and he said take your token and stand upon god's word with your unwavering faith and then as jesus said ask whatsoever you will amen you say to this mountain be cast into the sea and don't doubt in your heart you'll have what you asked for and i i encourage you to say that we don't need to fear anything we're god's children we're god's family we've been robed by the baptism of the holy ghost we have full access to his throne that's why paul said come boldly before the before the throne of god when you need mercy in the time of hell let me say this we've been empowered and we are equipped to fight the devil god has trained us for moments like this this age that we're living in with all of the uncertainty in the world this is what god has trained us for now what are we going to be what are we proving to be amen so i ask you what do we need to fear as paul said whom shall i fear what shall i be afraid we have full status as the offspring of god and we have been fully authorized to use the name of jesus for any need at any time let me say this to you again brothers this is the time and the hour to believe not to unbelieve not to make believe but to believe and so i just wanted to to say that to you i'm looking forward to the service tonight and i don't mean to preach before the preacher but i i just have so much joy in my heart today i am thrilled to be able to introduce you uh to brother cadre diggs a personal very close friend of mine has been for many years and maybe you've heard his ministry i'm sure he's been online in many places preached all over the world the brother is a sought-after evangelist uh who's who stood the test of time his testimony he lives what he preaches and i'm a witness of that today and i and i and i say that with sincerity i've watched the spirit of god use brother diggs in my life my children's life my family life and in the church here in beaufort i've watched god supernaturally use my brother with a gift of even discernment discerning specific things in people's lives that no one had any way to know we had a brother here uh diagnosed with diabetes was full-fledged type 2 diabetes told they told him he wouldn't live very much longer already had the symptoms started to go blind and and brother diggs came on a sunday morning not knowing any of the situation and started calling out diabetes and said i challenge you in the name of jesus christ to walk out of this building without your diabetes that's what he said they said unexplainably diabetes is gone his sugar completely reversed his vision came back all of his pains went away and today uh he's he's he's diabetes he's diabetes free now that's not a man that's not even a gift that's the holy spirit operating and using a gift god has put in this brother's life so we're not in the most conventional of circumstances here today some of you are there at home we're here in a fellowship paul it is me and brother diggs some of you are there gathered in the assembly today and you've sang you've worshiped you've called on the lord i believe there's an expectation here and i believe that distance doesn't matter doesn't matter that we're here in a building you're there in a building the holy spirit is in between us all and i believe he's going to take the preeminence now you take your need amen if you could just bow your heads with me we're going to pray as we turn the order uh turn the service over to our brother diggs i want you to buy your head with me there at home there in the audience uh and just musicians just continue if you're not already gone to play that play something very softly there amen i want you to take that need and i want you to lift it up before god with your head bowed eyes closed just raise that hand up to the lord even if you're there in your vehicle they're at home wherever you're at today just raise that need up and say lord jesus just as that woman touched the hem of your garment and your prophet said it was her faith lord your prophet said it wasn't her doing it wasn't jesus doing that all that the father showed him lord he did but your prophet picked it up and said but it was that woman doing that he said with her faith she touched jesus and he said virtue has left me now god i pray lord as we're miles or separate us here today father but we're all lord in your presence today god father and in your presence there's no distance there's no hindrance lord there's no awkwardness father lord we're comfortable today lord and we're under your mercy and your grace now may you meet the needs of each one that's lifted their hands up lord and lifted their hearts up god i pray lord that you would use my brother lord to minister your word father may it flow freely lord and may your spirit just contact and touch the lives of your children we ask we ask it in jesus christ's name amen god bless you god bless you brother dicks god thank the lord for being here you know he's sovereign and all that he does and all that he do you know we certainly appreciate brother matt and all the saints of god who are here today present with us we're gathering and you know like matt said these are unusual circumstances but the gospel must be preached and the gospel must be lived so whichever part you play you know do it to the best of your ability you know and uh like matt said you know we've been friends a very very long time and he's been such a blessing to me you know and i just thank god for me and who live their life you know under the leadership and direction of god so we don't have much to say but we just want to say you know we are glad to be among you today so let's just have a word of prayer and we'll get right into the word of god let's pray lord jesus father here we are again lord bowing before you as humbly as we know how and lord god you are always forever present lord and we pray that the needs and the different desires that the people have put before you lord lord you move it all into your perfect will for lord we don't want anything lord that's not of your perfect will lord so father we just pray you would bless the service lord be with everything mechanically lord let it work soundly lord and father god don't let it be my thoughts or my voice lord but let it all be you lord and father and in hearing lord give the saints understanding lord and father help us to practice the greatest gift given unto man that is moving out of the way and lord we just thank you and we give you honor glory and praise in the name of jesus christ amen amen if you have your bibles let's go straight to the word let's turn to um romans the 8th chapter romans chapter 8 romans chapter 8 and we're going to read a familiar verse of scripture you know something that we uh we've heard so many times but we're just praying that god would show it to you like he showed it to me romans chapter eight let's let's read um let's let's start reading that verse 26. it says likewise the spirit itself also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we alt but the spirit itself make it intercession for us with groaning which cannot be uttered and he that searches the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of god it says and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose amen let's turn over to second corinthians chapter 12. second corinthians chapter 12 and i i hope uh wherever you are you can adjust because i'm kind of a big mouth you know i i believe in giving it my all you know so second corinthians chapter 12. um let's just make the reading show let's start at verse seven the bible says unless i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of revelation there was given me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of satan to buffet me lest i should be exalted above measure for this i've assaulted the lord thrice that it might be that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore would i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me amen may the lord bless you love his word you can have your seats you know today by the grace of god i kind of want to preach a thought that's kind of personal amen you know i think that the lord is he's making our christian journey you know more and more personal that we're not just church members we're we're not just coming to a building to see one another but we're living what we believe amen and you know today i want to use for a subject god turning my negatives into a positive hallelujah you know he's turning my negative to a positive you know as we look in the scripture and if we take paul you know paul had a lot of things he went through you know if i could just you know relate some of them to you know the bible says he spent a night and day in the sea you know he was whipped i believe like five times you know there was one place in the scripture where he was stoned and he was even thrown over the wall for the gospel sakes but church paul come back through all that trouble all the negative things that happened in his life and he said if i glory if i find any peace if there's if there's any refuge in anything that happened to me that i will glory in the thing that i've suffered hallelujah because paul looking at all the negative things in his life saying hey i must be in the will of god so i have to look at these things from a positive lens hallelujah how often do we look at the troubles in our lives and we say oh the devil did this and oh the devil did that and the devil the devil the devil everything is not always the devil hallelujah some things that happen in our life you know the negative things in our lives are there for our strengthening hallelujah so i would rather like paul and this is my desire like paul i would rather glory in the things i suffered hallelujah because church if you remember and you complain about the things you're going through are you saying you that the devil has control of your life oh as a son and god son and daughter of god we ought to look at all the things we're going through and say god you're still in control you know i want to read you a quote you know when i first came across this it was just mind-boggling hallelujah because you know a lot of times we we we hear scripture but it don't click to a certain moment hallelujah listen this is this is in the message um um uh pre-planned by god hallelujah listen he says your birth he says your birth here was pre-planned he said i guess you believe that every one of you know that our birth was pre-planned did you know hallelujah did you know that you being here never originated just at a myth or a thought listen where you are right now hallelujah where i am right now it was all pre-planned by god but we say we're here because of cover 19 no ha-ha this has nothing to do with cover 19 this is the mind of god and see what we look at to be negative god is saying no i'm going to turn that negative into a positive hallelujah i'm going to take covert 19 and i'm going to make it into hallelujah a time of prayer hallelujah i'm going to make it into a time of fellowship between families amen i'ma show them that when they can't go to work i'm still a provider amen god took the negative and turned it into a positive hallelujah but it was already pre-planned god knew hallelujah god knew by copeland 19 just like he knew about the age epidemic harley the flu and ebola and all these other sicknesses holy god had already made a way of escape what was it it's called calvary's cross hallelujah church listen he said did you know that you've been here never originated just as a myth or a thought everything was all pre-planned by god before the foundation of the world that you're here now just to make that a little bit more simpler hallelujah that you could see where i'm going see what i want to do today by the grace of god i want to strip satan from all his power holy that's what we ought to do amen as a believer you are not to never give satan more power than you ought to have and whatever power he has over you you gave it to him hallelujah because church look god is the creator of all and he said all things were created for him and by him oh my wow hallelujah you mean to tell me god allows sickness so the purpose of god could be fulfilled hallelujah church i don't know about you but i'm seeing god move in such a mighty way in this time in hour but you know i want to talk about trouble you know we look at our troubles we look at our trials and sometimes we ask the question lord why me well i want to change it around today lord why not me hallelujah because what trouble does the prophet god says hallelujah i quoted this witch tonight he said god takes trouble and puts a bit in his mouth and he harnesses god controls the trouble god controls every negative in your life you know that's why we read romans the 8th chapter because the bible says in romans 8 it says but he says and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to the call to who are the called according to his purpose listen he says all things work together let's look at that work together what's working together my negative and my positive they're working together for my good amen now if you take a car hey man most of you who got cars in your front yard or wherever you may be you drive to work or whatever it is if you ride a scooter you ride a motorcycle whatever kind of horsepower you got hallelujah listen if it's buried if it battery oriented hugs if it runs by battery amen you could have gasoline you could have spark plugs you have everything mechanically in the right place holder and you can have a battery amen and that battery has to hook up to a positive hallelujah but you know what it's no good without the negative ground hallelujah that car that scooter that motorcycle that airplane that bus that train none of it is going no way without a negative ground so you have to have that negative working with the positive hollywood for things to work together hallelujah think about the church god uses the trouble and the negative things in your life to produce more positive character out of us hallelujah and you know if you you can go outside today just to test this theory go outside unhook your negative battery hold it unhook the negative ground i guarantee you your car won't work i guarantee you your motorcycle won't work hardly why because you need a negative in your life you know we look at it we say oh why am i going through this why am i going through that it's simple you're being perfected and the only way you can realize that you're being changed by the things you overcome hallelujah so you have to overcome something so you can see a positive amen and you know the negative holy god turning my negative into a positive my own personal testimony you know at a very young age i had cancer and this this wasn't just a regular cancer it was cancelling my brain hallelujah it was affecting my body it was affecting what i eat i was having headaches all these things it was such a negative time i beg to differ hallelujah because god used that negative moment to bring out a revelation that was already lying in me hardly so god used something negative huddly like cancer to bring out a positive revelation of jehovah rapha whoa hallelujah see he turned the negative into a positive and to this day when i get sick i just turn around and say oh jehovah tyra oh jehovah rapper what are you finna do now okay what do you do when you see trouble coming right now you know wherever you might be whether it's a it's a a monitor or you're just sitting in a church and different things no doubt you got lights around amen those lights can't even work without a negative ground you can't even get a sign over you without a negative ground the room won't even light up if negativity is not even present see so we ought to look at things different amen look church it's all through the scripture holy god he always allows negative to show his head so he can show his power remember in the book of job when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and the bible says and the devil came also oh god he allows negative things to come our way because it brings out more of him god allowed job what did you see about job negative negative negative losses lost his money negative lost his cattle negative lost his children negative lost his wife negative all of that just to prove to the devil he couldn't be shaken now what do you do when you meet all the trouble in your lives huh what do you do when you have trials and tribulations what do you do when everything is not going the way you expect it to go hallelujah look church hey man if we if we we if we look at the negative hey man listen god turning my negative into a positive hallelujah look the reason why i read paul again look paul said it's because of the revelation in me it's because of the understanding god has given me that god sends a messenger of satan to buffet him so that he could stay humble oh my heart god sent a messenger to a prophet hallelujah always messing with him i think brother branham said paul had trouble with his eyesight hallelujah and you know why did he have trouble with his eyesight so he wouldn't get lifted up in all the revelations that he had so god had to keep a negative in his life so he could remain positive hallelujah in church you wonder why you keep going in circles and some things because god don't want you to get exalted god wants you to stay humble and that way he can continue to use you hallelujah you know what the enemy does the enemy fights me a lot with my finances he said hey how you gonna be full-time time in the midst of covert 19 how you going to be full-time traveling when you can't travel amen i say i don't know it ain't up to me it's up to god hallelujah see it don't belong to me not my will but your will be done see it's according to how we look at the situation and one thing i want you to understand today that satan is not controlling anything hallelujah church god is not on the the defense of what satan is doing no god is always on the offense amen he's not on the defense trying to say oh i got to stop the devil oh i got to stop this oh i can't let him no satan is trying to stop god from moving hollering god is always on the offense hallelujah oh man you know church as i looked and i began to think about you know god throughout all the scriptures he took the negative and he turned it into a positive but in that moment the believer 9 is out of 10 they couldn't see it as a positive they wondered why this and why that and why am i going to listen look abraham god gave him a promise but to get to that promise he had to experience a lot of negative things first he had to experience a man a friction between his family friction between him and his nephew arguing and fussing look look his nephew is fussing with him about a land god has already given to abraham and look the devil's fussing with us about things god has already given to us hallelujah there's a sister at my church mira were talking she's trying to sell a house and buy another house and you know she started to think and think about how great god is and she said lord in the bible days you were giving out whole mountains lord lord you were giving out mountains surely a little three thousand square foot house is nothing to you hallelujah if you were giving up mountains and and land upon land and you told abraham as far as your eye can see it belongs to you surely you can sell a house surely you can give me the finances to buy another one when he's giving away whole mountains church we serve a powerful god this is not the time to be dismayed i'm here to proclaim today that your troubles are working for your good hallelujah and we got scripture to back it up the scripture says trouble don't last always and i'll give you another one church he said hallelujah in the time of trouble he shall hide me hallelujah so whom shall we fear church god is always working that negative to a positive hollywood and y'all know me those who have heard me preach before you know i ain't gonna be long i'm about to close hardly how i don't have punchlines where you say oh read me something i've never heard no catch the inspiration holly catch the inspiration that your troubles hallelujah you're negative hallelujah god is using that hallelujah to create a positive amen hallelujah before we got in this digital age we took pictures through cameras harley and those cameras had to be developed where in a dark room hurry but you never got the picture without a negative that's good oh the picture couldn't even be developed without a negative hunger in church sometimes we forget how simple god is but if you even go back to that see you millennials don't know what we're talking about hello but there was a time where they had to take pictures and they had to wait and had to put it i believe in a certain substance and and it had to be developed hallelujah but it was all in a negative form harley hey man and then once it was developed you know what if you lost that picture you could get it back why because you kept the negative wow it's the negative that can bring you back to life again it's the negative that can show who you really are amen it was the negative stuff that job was going through that really showed he was the son of god hallelujah so it ain't always the mountain top praise god i thank god for the mountaintop but sometimes it's the negative things you go through that shows the real character of who you are hallelujah you know if a man really loves his wife if he loses his job maybe a job he had for 20 years he lose that job but he said lord if i got the home of myself to go work at kings and and make some chicken or or work at burger king and make some burgers but i got to provide for my family hallelujah see in that moment god is showing his family his character hallelujah that he'll do whatever he has to do that his family will be provided for but it took a negative moment hallelujah going it always takes a negative moment to bring forth a positive amen hallelujah just like it was with luther luther look at all the negativity going into the catholic church and luther says i'm sick of it to just shall live by faith holly wesley got sick of hallelujah everybody living by faith and nobody living king clean and western said i'm sick of it we ought to be holy hallelujah and seymour his church got tired of seeing people who had faith hollywood who had clean lives holy but wouldn't let god have the preeminence so all that negative brought in a greater understanding it brought in a greater positive hallelujah to the place to our prophet looked at pentecost holy and saw them had the gifts amen they were sanctified they they believed in faith hallelujah but could they become perfect oh so don't be afraid of the negative in your life just know it there's some negative holly god has to be a deliverer hallelujah look church look it took a negative for moses to get put in position the king said hey look here kill everybody kill all the little boys from two years old hold up kill everybody and his mother hearing that negative statement she says you know what i ain't killing my son i'm going to put him in the river now that wasn't positive that was negative also hallelujah but see it took god to turn her negative into a positive she said oh lord i gotta give up my son but i'm not gonna let him die i'm not gonna let them kill him at the hands of pharaoh i'm going to put him in the water into your hands now god's going to take that negative into a positive prophecy now moses is floating down the river hallelujah in a basket hallelujah but look look at the negative being turned into a positive where did he go just so happened how moses comes floating in right where pharaoh's daughter is taking a bath hallelujah but look at it church she wasn't she wasn't of his kind she was an egyptian but god took that negative hurry turned into a pox what negative she couldn't have no children but she had a desire god took that negative heart her not having no children hurting and breaking moses dead hallelujah making that negative to a positive whoa we just don't know how god gonna do things hallelujah and god took took that his mother giving up a son something that seemed so negative to to to miriam following moses all the way down the river going up to to to the new caregiver which is pharaoh's uh daughter coming up to her say hey you want me to go get one of the maidens one of the hebrew brothers to feed him who did didn't go get moses's mother turned the negative into a positive and she had a chance to raise her own son and get paid for it oh in a better condition a better house better food better surrounding better clothes why because she didn't allow the negative to control her thoughts church don't let the negative control your thoughts paul said if i glory i'll glory in the things i've suffered holy i'll glory in my night and day in the sea i'll glory that one time i was by the fire and i got bit by a snake i got bit by a mamba holiday or a viper and i shook it off what what paul's saying now i know without a shadow of a doubt that the scripture is real they shall take up serpents i know some of y'all look at why this man preaching so hard go away the enemies fail to realize he called himself he think he's separating us off secluding us or keeping us from fellowshipping no we're gonna use the things that mankind created for the gospel hallelujah look look church if we could just go back to moses look moses raised up he was raised up and you know he got to a place to where he couldn't take it no more he saw uh one of the egyptians doing the hebrews wrong moses went down and popped his neck pop that was it negative all negative and did he hear he said oh i gotta run for my life pharaoh is gonna try to kill me all negative oh what did i do that led him to the back side of the desert what was he he was in the pre-plans of god god allowed that to happen just to get moses in position hallelujah and a lot of times god allowed us to go through negative things just to get us in position hallelujah now he'll allow moses to go through something negative feel bad about it look look look at all what happened just that one negative moment turned into positive harlot moses on the run supposed to be negative moses met jethro who's his father-in-law met his wife zipporah had kids all of that positive then he met god supposed to be something negative no hold on return to be positive hey man he ran from he ran from the position that he was supposed to have to take on a higher position earlier now god's telling moses i want you to go back hello go back he's like lord i can't talk negative negative i can't talk listen to god speaking to his negative he said shut up moses haven't i made you god you'll be god let aaron be your prophet god takes away our negative and shows us who we really are moses look at that i can't talk i'm high tempering god say who made your mouth hold my church we ought to be excited because amen if we take cover 19 they saying you know they don't have a uh a vaccine or cured food or whatever we ought to say praise god because that's bible the bible tells us that we're going to be in a time where there'll be sicknesses with no cure and all these things it'll be perilous times look we got homosexual rights and all these things church we're right here this ain't a time to be negative and say oh god thank you lord when i see them marching and carrying a sign and they hear us hear us i'll be like praise the lord thank you god we're in bible days thank you god hallelujah amen you see children disobedient to parents praise god we're in bible days holy we have a president hallelujah who won't even obey the old laws he create praise god we're in bible days church god don't get nervous we're going to be too much longer blue church now moses he calls back he's still placed the way he comes up the pharaoh he's like look pharaoh let my people go so that they can go worship the true and living god and pharaoh says no who i'm god oh my that was very negative but look god's gonna use that for his good now the thing we have to realize church is that nothing gets past god nothing in your life my life your children's life your spouse's life people in your church nothing catches god by surprise nothing and you you know it it's it's it's it's not surprising to me but it's i can't think of the right word you know but to know that god is even controlling the negatives you think about it first plague pharaoh's like hey hey i can't i can't do anything with this i'ma let the people go then god come and massage his heart god come and tighten his heart up some more see god was hardening his heart god was controlling the negative whoa the devil ain't doing nothing god is controlling the negative just like he controlled pharaoh hallelujah god said i'm gonna give me glory upon thee pharaoh i rose you up for this purpose hallelujah god hallelujah rose judas up so that somebody can be there to produce a negative in the midst of all that positive hallelujah so church god takes our troubles and he massages it hallelujah to bring out the best in you hey man you take a if you want some good lemonade holly you you know sometimes people they just taking they chop it up chop it up chop it up throw it all in they know you want some good lemonade you got to squeeze it squeeze it and squeeze it and squeeze it you get some of the you get some of the lemon juice and you get some of the juice from the hurl hallelujah hallelujah hooray the real power is in the coating on the outside of the lemon huh that's where the real coating is that's where the real power is amen you think about a church you look at a chick how is how it's born in the egg what makes it strong the fight to get out of it holy it has to pep its way out holy but there's something put in place on his beak the prophet said hallelujah that it could pep pep pep pap pep pep peppa some of you need to be pepping hallelujah some of you sit back wham in your head no use what god gave there's a special ingredient in your life there's a special ingredient in your trial that god has only given to you so you can fight your way out hallelujah and you know what what that chicken does that little that little chicklet it peps and it peps in his pants and you know the more it peps the stronger it neck get holly hallelujah so in the meantime as it's fighting its way out his whole body is hurting receiving strength from that fight and that's what happens with us as believers church hallelujah in this time where there's so much negative we see with our eyes we have to be able to say that god is in control of all of us god is in control of our president he's controlling the vice president he's controlling the governors and so forth i thank god for where i live holly because we had a governor who said church is essential i don't know what y'all govern in arizona or wherever you may be streaming us but how they feel about church but our governor he said church is essential i want the people to get back in church oh and we've been having a good time in the midst of this covet 19 pandemic holy but you know what church let me read you something before i close now just to go back to the quote i read it says that before you even got here your life was pre-planned so if you get sick god already knew you was gonna get sick you lose your house he already knew you was going to lose it your children go in the world he already knew it if your marriage mess up he already knew it so who you going to be mad at hallelujah you can't be mad at nobody god already knew you ought to say lord give me strength to go through this give me strength to go through it lord because lord if you already knew it was going to happen that means hallelujah you put something in me to go through it hallelujah hurray there's something in us hallelujah for this age to be able to go through all the things that are taking place listen our lives are pre-planned by god holy so god knew holy that every last church age believer would be here to withstand the virus of covert 19. hallelujah that's just me i worship god in the way of heresy i believe against all odds no matter what they may say i pull my bible up and i say well my bible say something different hallelujah church hey man i didn't fault some serious demons hallelujah hadn't fought the demon of cancer how they fought the deep demon of diabetes type one and two a and b c and d hallelujah i didn't fall at all i didn't fought blindness hallelujah i didn't fought depression i hadn't fought heartache hallelujah and i'm still here what is it holy is god using my negative to the positive how does god make us strong by the things we suffer look if jesus was made strong made perfect by the things he suffered what about us the bible says he's a god that can be touched by the feelings of your infirmities so that means there's nothing that we can go through that god hasn't already went through church i was in church the other day and the brother was praying and he said something that i never really thought about before and you know i believe somebody's setting up a prayer request and you could be listening to me right now because i'm feeling it's coming forward you could be listening to me right now i'm gonna give you a scripture for that headache hallelujah you know when he began to uh read over a prayer request somebody got a headache he and in his prayer he said jesus had thorns on his head for your headache oh yeah church everything was covered hallelujah you say well brother dick i can't eat certain stuff because my stomach gets sore he drunk vinegar for you he knew what an upset stomach feels like hallelujah you got a right to eat whatever you want to eat hallelujah church he felt it all he felt everything we're going through hollywood he know what it's like to have a broken heart oh yeah he know what it's like to feel forsaken hallelujah you can't tell me what you're going through that god can't turn that negative into a positive that's right you look at the cross and they say well we're going to crucify him one of the most horrendous deaths that man could ever produce hallelujah put a man on a cross and nail him to it hollywood that he'll die of suffocation because he can't get enough strip in his lungs to breathe god turned that depth into a positive wow god turn your negative my into a positive hallelujah oh my church listen listen as i prepare to close listen to me everybody all right say amen listen listen to the message i know this is a powerful message now hallelujah hurry listen he says and sometimes we have more troubles when we become a christian can i get amen you know the devil want to tell you everything was good before you got baptized everything was good before you became a message believer when you was a baptist you ain't had all these problems when you was a pentecostal you had all those problems you know why because in that state you'd never become perfect but when you step into an atmosphere where you can be with perfect when you can be perfected when you become perfect the hammer and the chisel it goes a little bit faster you know i got a quote from michelangelo michelangelo hallelujah he says in every stone there's an angel you just have to beat it out hallelujah oh yeah so whenever he looks at stone he sees an image of it hallelujah in his mind so he starts the hammering and covering hallelujah so his mind always comes in front of him as he begins to work through the trial of hammering and beating hallelujah and god's doing the same thing in us hallelujah he can see who we really are but what does he do he hammers and he beats he hammers and he beats he sees sons and daughters of god in us already but he has to bring out the hammer and chisel to bring us into the image of his mind listen he said then we he said he said he he said when we become a christian then we did when we were uh sinners we had more troubles than we become christians then we were sinners he says cause it is written many is the affliction of the righteous i ought to be in the clothes right there i can close and walk away right there that's your answer to everything you're going through you can look at your child today and say the bible says many of the afflictions of the righteous now i know i try to live a righteous life so therefore my righteousness is connected to affliction whoa oh let's change it around my afflictions is connected to the righteousness of god oh yeah but then the bible says but the lord delivered them out of them all hallelujah hallelujah he said but god delivered him from them all god promised many afflictions god now listen the prophet is saying god promised many afflictions he promised negativity oh my oh my he said he promised me the affliction strange feelings and strange things that will be beyond our understanding now i know as believers as sons and daughters of god we go through things that we don't understand right hell yeah and i'd be the first one to say amen to that holy i've been through some stuff that i don't understand you know it makes it almost form up a word in your mouth that you ought not to never use when it comes to god why y'all never let that word form up in your mouth why god always has a purpose always has a purpose don't question god he always has a purpose hell yeah listen he said if things happen that we don't understand but look he says but it's always done for our good amen hallelujah let's close church there'll be many things that happen that we don't understand but it always works for our good look at the condition of your church hallelujah look at the condition of your family hallelujah look at the condition of your job your household whatever it may be it may be a lot of trouble and you don't understand but it's working for your good now you ought to rejoice church i want you to realize these are not the words of brother diggs what i'm preaching to you is bible and the scriptures cannot be broken and i give you one of the most powerful quotes you know i was i was going through a trial hallelujah and god showed me a quote that the prophet god said he said the scriptures are guilty until they're fulfilled in your life how you believe oh wait he said god is guilty until he fulfills the scripture in your life if you believe it so if you're sick and you're saying god is a healer holy god can be held guilty if he don't heal you according to your faith if you got financial issues hallelujah you didn't pay your tithes and offers and you're trying to be faithful bringing a guard storehouse and you say brother jake i still don't have a love hallelujah god is guilty until he opened the windows of heaven like the scriptures say so you know what after i pay my tithes and you know i may have ten dollars in my pocket i say lord you said you said try you see if you open the windows of heaven and i say now lord i'm just waiting on my blessing and i ain't just waiting on a little blessing you said more than i'll be able to contain whoa we have to believe god like the scriptures say hallelujah oh my listen you say i know some of you all seem to say man why is that brother streaming i'm in my house calm it down oh you wait you wait until this these travel uh documents and all this stuff lifts and i'm standing in front of you in the church giving you a high five and shaking your hand and you're like whoa this brother's really radical no i just love god hallelujah listen he says but it's always done for our good just can't understand it but if we did listen when things happen and you can't understand it hell yeah god has it that way for a purpose before the prophet god says he says because if we did meaning understand it then it would not be faith to us hallelujah if you could understand hulia if you had the remedy for covet 19 hallelujah hallelujah you wouldn't be pressing like you're pressing now holy so what is god doing god's developing a stronger faith in the believer's heart because of this atmosphere hallelujah he said we will go with an understanding he says but we do it hallelujah we have it we believe by faith his word that is going to work some good thing for us if we could grasp that today hallelujah this morning if we could grasp that all of our troubles hallelujah all of your troubles what brother is working for my good somebody repeat that it's working for my good he said well this well the monsoons came to share a little bit more than we expected and it washed away my house god got a bigger house he said we could grasp that today or this morning if we could grasp that all our troubles he said and there's none of us immune from them you know brother branham had troubles he had plenty of troubles hardly he had uh years of persecution for the ris hollywood but what happened god was developing more and more character out of our prophet god allowed that to happen why because way down inside brother branham had a lying spirit [Music] don't cut me off now don't cut me off he's in the message don't cut me out that pressure god put pressure on him god put negativity on him why so god could get that little bit of line out of him that little bit of love that nobody else see and he said hey honey tell them i'm not in here and media came back say bill that wasn't just right he said well honey i wasn't in there i wasn't quite in there then he went off you know like we do sometimes we do things in his flesh and we still want to serve god brother brother went out to pray and god said get your hand off that child you ain't fit to pray far cause you just told a lie so you know what he did see the heart of a true servant when you find out you're wrong you don't play games with god you fall on your knees and repent holly what is that that's the character of david a man after god's very own heart holy as many times david did wrong as much negative came into his life david always repented he turned that negative into a positive wow listen he said if we could realize that those things are for our good it is written in one of the scriptures in the bible that trials are brought upon us hallelujah more precious to us than gold itself for is god listen he said for it is god giving us the trial oh my after we become his property our confession and our baptism holy and our promise to walk in life for him then every trial that comes upon us is to perfect us for his glory man that's powerful after you make your confession after you say lord i'll serve you lord you're my god you're my savior he said every trial from that confession from that moment is put into your life to perfect you so we ought to be rejoicing amen you have to look around right now you know whatever you're going through you know you may be silenced and you may be in a core amen flip that thing flip it for your good flip it for flip it make your quarantine a communion with god hallelujah church i know people who who got laid off from the job and they made more money off their job than they did when they were working the job they were getting bigger checks every week sitting at home than they was working a job thank god for kobe 19. i know some of you might be saying that brother crazy well yeah leave me alone i like being this way holly this he says from that point perfect us for his glory it's to bring us to a place where god can make himself more real to us than he was before the trial come so what's all this about and i'm i'm preparing to close what's all this about god is trying to make himself even more real now than he was before the trial came and i'll just give you a little insight you know because i live off the gospel i hadn't been able to travel much and preach hallelujah because of the travel restrictions holly living of the gospel but you know what god is constantly making away sometimes i just sometimes i just throw my hands up and i just say lord you're just too good to me hallelujah i say lord you just you just you're just too good and then i think about the word good and i said yeah chicken good i said god you're just too great hallelujah you're just too great hallelujah lord you your words can't express how great you are in a time where i should be struggling god should make it away hallelujah and a lot of times they use the sensitive hearts of the saints you know i've had a brother call me you know this one brother you know church uh uh um i was standing in need of something i really i really needed some some finances i needed some capital honestly and you know i was thinking i was like lord i was praying and i said lord i know up until this time i've been faithful paying my tithe now you told me the wills of heaven will be open i said god i got a need you're my jehovah jairo church and no more then i prayed that prayer maybe a couple days later i got a phone call from a brother he comes hey brother diggs this brother window has a brother window remember me you preached at our church media church it was about 15 years ago it was a little work that they were trying to start up in florida and i went down there as a young minister hallelujah me and some more brothers we went down there hallelujah to help the church preaching a hotel hallelujah and from that time to this time that brother always remembered me and in my time of need god put me on his heart and he got my name and called me and said brother diggs you got cash out i want to send you some money you can't tell me my god ain't faithful i spoke to that brother in 15 to 17 years and he called me up right in the moment when i was in need right in a negative time god turned my negative into a positive hallelujah in church not only did he bless me hallelujah with finances he began to tell me his testimony how he remembered i got delivered from cancer he said you know what brother holly he said i got delivered from cancer also hallelujah church god is he's just glorious hallelujah but you know we look through the scripture we we see a lot of negative god turns rahab negative until positive hallelujah he turns jacob negative into a positive at one point in his life he was running from his running from his brother his brother was going to kill him he lied to his daddy he was an outcast hallelujah he get down there he got tricked by his father-in-law he married a woman he didn't really want to marry hallelujah then she huddly started having babies and the one he loved she couldn't have no baby negative negative negative negative holy now he got four women fighting over them two hands maze and two wives negative names what was it guards producing something positive the children of israel came out of all that negative and then a perfect type came out even more negative amen joseph hallelujah brothers was mad at him they were jealous how he sold him into a pit did he get out the pit get into potiphar's house she lied on him negative negative didn't get thrown in jail negative negative negative then he gets before the buckling bigger amen tell them something positive and he said hey don't forget me they forget something even more negative just so god could get him to pharaoh's throne 17 years later oh my it don't matter how long you see negative it matters how long you can believe god and just to know church if you don't remember anything i've said today just remember when it comes to god and his saints every negative has to be turned into positive because there's only going to be positive energy in heaven ain't nobody going to be there saying oh i got a headache oh why god let me bring this to heaven oh god why does why they know every negative in your life at one way or another has to become a positive like i say i had cancer diabetes all these things amen uh uh at one point i was losing my eyesight because god was trying to get me to go full time in the ministry and i'm walking around blind wondering what's going on and all god was trying to do was get me in position could it be this morning the negative in your life is only god trying to get you in position cause that's all it be why don't you just surrender and let god turn your negative to a positive harley church it got paul got he got he got so much assurance from the things he went through and and he became one with his life's journey to even question god anymore when he stood there before hollywood two two men that could be his judge uh uh festus and uh what was the other brother name um agrippa he's standing there between festus and agrippa and and they looking like they got control of his life paul looked him in their face and say for this purpose i came he said you don't want to go to rome you're going to die this net paul say for this purpose i can't see you had become one with this purpose church paul hallelujah he had to receive jail time hardly he had his journey hallelujah it came with a sentencing of jail huh why why did paul have to go to jail because that was the only way god could get some of the new testament out of him hallelujah he had to sit in jail and white write philippians and galatians and different books whoa he couldn't do it while he was out on the field he could only write those books while he was in jail hallelujah because there's one particular part where paul says hey and by the way bring me a coat oh hallelujah church there are things in your life negatives that god turns into a positive amen look holy david committed adultery with besheba and god brought a positive idea what was it psalm 51 created me a clean heart take not that holy spirit for me she had all that negative god still got a positive out of it how many of us sing that song and that psalm brings us into the presence of god but david had to experience a negative so we can experience the positive and you know the scripture says god says i'll take away hallelujah the first to establish the second hallelujah he'll take away this negative hallelujah he'll take away this flesh hallelujah what to establish hallelujah the spirit man that's why he says you must be born again he allows us to experience the negative so we can appreciate where we come from amen let's just bow our heads we thank god for your time let's pray lord jesus father we love you and we thank you for all that you've done lord and we pray that something was said to help your people and lord we just we we're just so grateful lord that you're a god who's always on time you're a god who's you're you're not a strange god but you're you're a loving husband lord lord you're here to hold our hand and to be with us through everything we go through lord lord because you're controlling all of our negatives and lord let your people order the sound of my voice look at their life different lord to know that our lives are pre-planned every negative you already saw even the trials that we're going through right now couldn't be the hand of god and lord you're working things for our good lord we pray to bless the church lord and and every worker every labor in this in this work lord we pray you continue to shape it into the image of your mind in the precious name of jesus christ we pray god bless you saints amen friends i trust that that was a blessing i mean just a moment to get hooked up here amen i trust that the word was just a blessing to you amen it was to me as i just sat here and heard it and it and it was uh i believe it was right on time i believe uh god just put this put this together the way that he did for a purpose i trust that you're sensitive to that today amen i was for me uh just so many things holding before the lord in prayer amen and i was so encouraged by the word today so i i want you just as the musicians could come if they're not already uh let's all stand to our feet together i want the musicians to come back and just play something softly for me amen and brother aaron will come behind me amen and maybe lead just a few songs and brother and if you have anything you want to share feel free amen i just want to encourage you today i i believe that that sermon that was preached that god put that inspiration upon now he could have preached anything but god specifically put that inspiration on brother diggs heart for a specific need multiple needs in our life and so as you if you stand to your feet with me if you're standing by your heads with me amen all across the building there at home amen the musicians just play something softly for me i want to say to you today the bible says all things work together for the good of those that are called according to his purpose those that love him and are called according to his purpose now it doesn't say that all things that happened to us are good because not everything that happens is good as we heard today it's the negative that god uses us to bring out the positive amen to fulfill his purposes he uses negative in our life i thought of so many examples brother diggs gave now every head bowed now every act closed amen i thought of so many examples today and uh and my mind just raced as i thought of this example in this example of how many times through what we would in our own human intellect have a misunderstanding even things that we read about in the bible we say why did sarah have to be barren why why do you read stories like jonah getting swallowed up by a well and god used that for a purpose why did i thought about that example brother dig brother diggs gave of of the mother of moses how that you know she gives up her baby to try to save his life and she didn't know throughout all that negativity when she was putting moses in that in that in that ark uh brother branham said in that ark and that in that enclosure and put him on the nile river in the midst of crocodiles and alligators she had no idea that it was in that negative moment that out of that negativity would bring her deliverance and and all of god's people's deliverance think about that friends now now we could look at bible stories we could think of the negative that happened to the prophet's life even the story brother diggs gave about the little girl being prayed for and god had to use it to get brother brandon's attention over something you think of the i could i could give you a hundred different examples but i i want you to zero in down zero down further on your life this morning amen zero down further on your life this morning and i want you to i want you to think just here for a moment with your head bowed what about that negative in your life what about that negative situation or that negative report of the negative spirit maybe it's just a negative spirit you feel in your life and ask yourself today god what why have you placed that buffer as you did paul that thorn it's for a purpose lord you put it there for a reason and oh here's what i believe with my hands raised here's what i believe all things work together not all things are good but all things work together for the good of those that love him those that are called according to his purpose and so i i want to with your head bowed your eyes closed i want you just to just for a moment i want to read you this uh this quote here head bowed eye closed brother branham says brother diggs quoted this he says that when your faith is put to a test then don't fail stay right with what you believe and when their faith was put to a test when they went to a crucial hour not only did they go to an ash heap but they went into a fiery furnace but satan could not destroy them for god's purpose wasn't yet fulfilled they could go in there with this hope i know my redeemer liveth they could go in there with this hope we are assured that god is able to deliver us from this fiery furnace but nevertheless we will not bow to the image satan could not take them he could not drown noah in the flood until the purpose of god had been finished he could not burn up the hebrew children until the purpose of god had been finished he could not kill job with boils and troubles until the purpose of god had been finished neither could the lions eat daniel until the purpose of god had been finished neither could death and old age take abraham until the purpose of god had been finished and neither can it take you or can it take me until the purpose of god of our life is finished so we gather from there with this consolation and why does god let troubles come god harnesses trouble puts bits in its mouth like a horse makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with god listen to what he says here there had been no rainbow until the flood came but after noah was pressed into that condition that he was in to float 40 days and nights in a storm and the ark pitching up and down in the water it was after the flood was over that he saw the rainbow for the for the first time the covenant of hope the covenant of promise after he had went through the tribulation then he saw the promise that's the way you see the promise after you've gone through the tribulation i've liked the poem or psalm that said must i be carried home to heaven on a flowery bed of ease while other while others fought to win the prize and sell through bloody seas we ask for comfort and peace and god gives us the best he could give us trials and tribulations that's better than the comfort and peace our comfort is just beyond the river oh listen to what the prophet says it was until it wasn't until the hebrew children was forced into the fiery furnace and on one of their most outstanding trials that they seen one like the son of god standing amongst them listen to the statement their troubles produced the son of god standing among them in the breezes to wave away the heat but not until they went into the fire did that comfort to repair it was daniel who had purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the things of the world and was forced through a trial whether he would go to pray to god or go to the lion's den but it was after the heat was put upon him that he was thrown into the lions then after that he saw the angel of the lord standing in the midst keeping away he says that great pillar of fire standing between him and the lions and the lions couldn't get to him because he had went through the trials and temptations and the troubles let me add through the negative and he knew that his god was able to deliver him now brother sisters with your head bowed your eyes closed amen you heard the sermon today i believe it was specific here brother dicks your brother brother our uh our our brother uh is going to preach here tonight amen brother lyle's going to preach here tonight on joseph and here brother diggs doesn't even know that has no clue i had no conversation with him and here brother brother lyle is going to pick up joseph and there you heard brother diggs just catching that tune coming right down to potiphar's house to the butler to the baker it was after all of that trouble and negative that brings the salvation to benjamin to judah and so friends i just say today why does god love let troubles come in your life he brings that negative to bring you into the positive so bring lift that need up with me here today lord jesus we thank you for your word father we thank you for your promise god lord that no matter what trouble

world for the very creation was finished right there hey man do you love him for that do you appreciate him for that his goodness he pre-planned we read that quote we emphasize that quote wednesday

time as i'm going through that brother and that sister their life seems so much easier than mine they don't seem to have any issues at all they're always happy they always seem to be overcoming the lord until we walk in one another's shoes we would really understand one another and you know exactly how to test how to try what to bring in our lives to produce that which you've seen in us already

that is already there these troubles these trials these these beatings lord they're producing perfection they're producing the children of god lord just help us to believe that lord if we were being
