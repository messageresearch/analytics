[37:19] friend was by Providence we met him and
[37:22] his wife brother Dale and sister Unice
[37:25] is it is that pronounced that
[37:27] right Caitlyn and I met them last week
[37:30] at Costco and I think it was the Divine
[37:32] Providence and we got to talking a
[37:34] little bit
[37:36] and T talked about where we went to
[37:38] church and he said you know back in the
[37:42] 60s I delivered newspapers to that
[37:45] church and we got to talking a little
[37:47] bit and came to the conclusion he had
[37:50] interacted with brother green it sounded
[37:52] like and he had
[37:54] said back in there he sent this later to
[37:56] me he said he said I met Mr Perry when I
[38:00] was a bicycle paper boy way back in the
[38:02] early 60s and Mr P Perry just so
[38:05] happened to have made a big impression
[38:07] on me as a young boy because of his
[38:09] unusual kindness toward me I thought
[38:12] that was interesting at the time I think
[38:13] he said he wasn't even a Christian or
[38:15] whatever and just had made an impact on
[38:17] his life and they live up in Catalina
[38:19] and go to a church up there and they
[38:21] just came to visit us this morning so
[38:24] welcome God bless
[38:25] you
[38:29] brother Daniel's been talking about
[38:31] witnessing and sharing about the Lord
[38:34] and what caught my attention with him as
[38:36] I was walking by he had a shirt on that
[38:38] said Jesus loves you I think it said and
[38:41] I said I like the shirt that struck up a
[38:43] conversation and he wasn't ashamed to
[38:46] share what the Lord's done in his life
[38:49] amen
[38:50] amen let's just stand this morning as we
[38:54] turn the service over to brother Aaron

[40:03] [Music]
[40:15] wings on the wings of a
[40:21] d amen you may be
[40:24] seated we got a update just a little
[40:27] while ago from Brother Daniel Evans
[40:30] saying that they've got a flight
[40:31] tomorrow at
[40:33] 11:45 to be able to come home they
[40:36] couldn't leave before that because the
[40:37] airplanes haven't come back to the
[40:39] airport yet I'm sure you saw the wave
[40:42] action and told him if that was Southern
[40:45] California there'd be people surfing on
[40:48] that and I I talked to him on the phone
[40:50] and I could hear the wind it was just
[40:52] blasting there so he asked me if I'd
[40:55] ever been through one of those and I
[40:56] said no I've never said I've been
[40:59] through a couple earthquakes in Southern
[41:00] California and those were scary
[41:02] enough but um so Lord willing they'll
[41:06] they'll have a safe trip home'll be back
[41:08] with us
[41:10] so he had sent me a text on uh Thursday
[41:14] I believe it was and he said don't know
[41:16] if we're going to make it home this
[41:18] weekend he says please be
[41:20] ready and um that makes your heart go
[41:23] like oh no you know but we just be began
[41:26] to see if the Lord would give us
[41:27] something and then he on Saturday he
[41:29] sent the information that we would
[41:30] listen to the life story of brother
[41:33] brand the one preaching 1959 in Los
[41:36] Angeles and um he asked me if I'd ever
[41:39] met brother brandom or heard of brother
[41:41] brandham I said no when brother Brandon
[41:43] passed away I had just turned six years
[41:44] old I was just a young boy but my
[41:48] parents had heard of him but didn't get
[41:50] to go to his
[41:51] service so he said just maybe share some
[41:54] what it's meant to you how you heard
[41:56] about it so yesterday as I was thinking
[41:59] and how many of people one thing I
[42:01] remember when we heard this message
[42:04] about brother Brandon was the folks of
[42:07] the Pentecostal church we belong to were
[42:08] asking how could a prophet of God die in
[42:12] such a terrible
[42:13] accident and it made me to think have
[42:17] you ever read the
[42:19] scriptures about some of the most most
[42:22] used men of
[42:23] God what their life was like
[42:27] you would say well they just had a bed
[42:29] of ease no it it was a struggle it it
[42:31] was a
[42:32] battle I thought of
[42:37] Abraham he was given a promise the
[42:40] father of of of the Jewish of Israel
[42:44] given a promise but it was not a bad of
[42:47] Beast there was a battle there he even
[42:51] lied about his own wife so he wouldn't
[42:53] lose his own life but because he he was
[42:56] a child of God God kept
[42:58] him thought about Moses the greatest
[43:01] Prophet that at that time who spoke face
[43:04] to face with God got to see
[43:07] him and there were times that Moses was
[43:10] not even allowed to cross into the other
[43:13] side you know think about that David a
[43:17] man after God's Own Heart who wrote most
[43:20] of the book of
[43:22] Psalms yet look look at his
[43:25] life Paul the first age messenger we've
[43:29] just gone through the book of Acts look
[43:31] at all that he went
[43:33] through he was actually killed once and
[43:37] the Saints prayed for him and his life
[43:38] came back the scripture records that but
[43:41] he says I'm headed to Jerusalem knowing
[43:43] I'm going to give my life for this
[43:46] gospel all the apostles with exception
[43:49] of
[43:50] John died a cruel
[43:53] death so why would it be any different
[43:55] today
[43:57] willing to give yourself for him
[44:00] whatever it
[44:01] takes there was Enoch there was St John
[44:05] St John lived to write the Book of
[44:07] Revelation Liv and Enoch we just know
[44:09] that he pleased God and he went
[44:11] home but if you read the story and the
[44:14] history everyone had their Hard Times
[44:16] their hard trials
[44:18] so the same folks that mentioned that to
[44:21] my parents to my dad I believe it was
[44:22] about how could somebody die like that
[44:25] he just asked him how about this great
[44:26] minister of yours that you all Reverend
[44:30] didn't he die in a rollover accent
[44:31] himself then they couldn't have nothing
[44:33] to
[44:34] say but I'm grateful that
[44:36] God sent a prophet in this day and age
[44:40] because where would we
[44:43] be you know and if if if Paul had come
[44:46] in this age we'd be playing Paul's
[44:49] recordings
[44:50] today but we read his writings because
[44:52] that's how the information was got but
[44:54] by the grace of God we get to hear see
[44:58] and some of us not too many left got to
[45:00] know him and meet
[45:02] him but we did hear about brother
[45:04] brandom when he was about 14 years
[45:06] old I had been raised a Christian in my
[45:09] whole life my parents love the Lord
[45:11] Jesus I believe they gave their heart to
[45:14] the Lord both of them and their
[45:16] teens my mom's experience with the Holy
[45:18] Spirit when she received the Holy Ghost
[45:20] she said I was bathed in a ball of fire
[45:23] and changed her whole
[45:24] life he's still the same yesterday today
[45:28] and forever he changes not so we were
[45:31] raised that
[45:32] way and and dad always taught taught us
[45:37] TR believe the Bible it's the truth it
[45:41] works and he he he raises his Christians
[45:44] me in my brother and sister and to love
[45:47] the Lord Jesus in all
[45:49] things and when this message came we
[45:53] moved from California came to Tucson and
[45:55] been here since it's going on 47 48
[45:58] years now and I don't regret it God has
[46:02] been good to
[46:03] us just thinking about those things when
[46:06] God makes himself real to you doesn't
[46:10] make a difference what the world says
[46:12] he's my Lord he's my savior
[46:15] so in my own life as I I come listening
[46:18] to the
[46:19] message maybe when you first came in you
[46:22] you thought you you just had to know it
[46:24] all you had to receive it all you had to
[46:26] understand it all no you just had to
[46:28] give your heart to the
[46:30] Lord and I found that to be the key if
[46:32] you'll just trust in him give your heart
[46:34] to the Lord and say Lord you lead me
[46:36] he'll take you to the truth sir we we
[46:40] and I'm not saying because I got great
[46:42] encouragement by brothers who who knew
[46:44] the message brothers who love the Lord
[46:46] but the experience is yours and god's
[46:49] together and that's that's the one that
[46:51] holds
[46:52] you and raising my my daughters the same
[46:56] way as best we could the lord gave me a
[46:59] wife who believed this message who
[47:01] actually attended the Tabernacle when
[47:03] the orig Tabernacle when she was a
[47:04] little
[47:05] girl and and got to know the
[47:09] truth and that doesn't make us better
[47:12] than anybody
[47:14] else we should just love the Lord Jesus
[47:16] more for it that he's been mindful of us
[47:19] if we don't take that attitude that I'm
[47:21] better than them because I know more but
[47:24] let us just be a light
[47:26] let a testimony like like this friend
[47:28] that this man that you met the family
[47:30] they said there's something about he
[47:31] said brother green the way he treated me
[47:34] as a young boy it spoke to me you know
[47:38] that somebody would come and says you
[47:39] know I'm in a situation I'm in a place
[47:41] but there's something about your life
[47:43] and your attitude that I feel I can go
[47:45] and talk to you and you could pray some
[47:47] people don't know how to pray some
[47:48] people don't know how to reach God but
[47:50] maybe you could lead them to that Lord
[47:53] Jesus Christ and that would be the
[47:56] greatest effect of this message of Jesus
[47:58] Christ the same yesterday today and
[48:01] forever because of
[48:04] you how many would would lift their hand
[48:06] and say that what a blessing it would be
[48:08] on the other side that somebody would
[48:11] come up to you and say but because of
[48:12] you I'm here
[48:14] today that would be a wonderful thing in
[48:17] in your own life maybe not the words you
[48:20] said maybe not how you preach them but
[48:22] the life you lived the love you shared
[48:26] and if you read this message and you
[48:29] hear this message what was brother
[48:30] bram's greatest emphasis staying true to
[48:33] the word of God but he spoke of the love
[48:36] of
[48:37] God you hear him how he talks about
[48:39] himself how he was just a rank sinner
[48:41] but God in his great Mercy reached out
[48:44] to him so how sh why should I be any
[48:47] different but say Lord as you had mercy
[48:49] on me have mercy on somebody else you
[48:52] know give that have that opportunity you
[48:55] can can't make them believe give them
[48:57] the opportunity to believe amen so we'll
[49:01] listen to the first half this
[49:04] morning uh and right before just a
[49:08] couple paragraphs before where Brother D
[49:10] Daniel wants us to start brother Brandon
[49:12] makes a a a statement he goes I don't
[49:14] know if the hookup is on he goes are
[49:17] they are they going to be able to hear
[49:19] and the brother comes in and he says yes
[49:21] he says we've got the hookups here
[49:23] there'll be thousands Maybe tens of
[49:26] thousands listening to you this
[49:28] morning I thought to myself when I heard
[49:31] that I said man if I knew 10,000 people
[49:32] were listening to me this morning I
[49:34] don't know if I had to come
[49:35] out but I appreciate a man that would
[49:38] stand up and trust in God and believe
[49:42] and be able to say you know what I'm
[49:44] waiting for and then say he's
[49:47] here and when he's here all things are
[49:50] possible let's
[49:52] stand the song that pleased the angel of
[49:55] of the Lord that please God was brother
[49:58] brandham said only believe all things
[50:01] are possible you have something before
[50:04] the Lord something you desire something
[50:07] you have great need of only believe all
[50:11] things are

[51:29] Lord I
[51:33] believe all things are
[51:38] possible Lord
[51:41] I
[51:44] believe you may be
[51:46] seated right about an hour long how many
[51:50] is there anybody here that's not heard
[51:52] brother Ram's testimonies never heard it
[51:54] it'll be a first
[51:56] time our visitors here and some here he
[52:01] was a
[52:02] man he was nothing more than a
[52:06] man he was not an angel he was a man who
[52:09] surrendered and yielded something you'll
[52:11] hear him talk about his some of his
[52:12] desires and things because he was a man
[52:16] who gave his heart to the Lord and if he
[52:18] could do it so can you God bless
[52:24] you
[52:34] my thoughts I want to preach on the
[52:36] subject tonight if you'll show us the
[52:39] father it will
[52:41] satisfies now I wish to read for a text
[52:45] this afternoon just to start off the
[52:47] life story found over in the book of
[52:51] Hebrews the 13th
[52:54] chapter
[52:56] and let's begin here about I'd say about
[52:59] the 12th
[53:00] verse wherefore Jesus also that he might
[53:04] sanctify the people with his own blood
[53:08] suffered without the gate let us go
[53:12] therefore to him without the camp
[53:16] bearing his
[53:19] reproach for here we have no continuing
[53:23] City but we seek one to come now that is
[53:29] kind of a
[53:30] text for you see if it's a life story or
[53:34] anything pertaining to a human being we
[53:37] don't glorify that and especially a
[53:41] man's past if it's been as dark as mine
[53:44] has been but I thought if we read the
[53:47] scripture God would bless the scripture
[53:50] and my thought is that here we have no
[53:54] continuing
[53:55] City but we seek one to
[53:59] come now I know that you're very fond of
[54:02] Los Angeles you have a right to be it's
[54:05] a great beautiful city with its Smog and
[54:10] whatmore yet it's a beautiful city fine
[54:15] climate but this city cannot
[54:19] continue it's got to have an end I've
[54:22] stood in Rome or the great Emperors and
[54:26] the cities that they thought they would
[54:28] build
[54:29] Immortal and dig down 20 ft to even find
[54:33] the ruins of it I stood where the
[54:35] Pharaohs has had their great
[54:38] kingdoms and you dig down in the ground
[54:41] to find where the great pharaohs
[54:44] ruled all of us like to think about our
[54:47] city and our place but
[54:50] remember it cannot
[54:53] stand when I was a little boy I used to
[54:55] go to a great maple tree in my country
[54:59] we have a lot of hardwood and then we
[55:01] had this maple trees the sugar maple and
[55:06] what we call the hard maple soft maple
[55:09] this great gigantic tree it was the most
[55:13] beautiful tree when I would come in from
[55:16] the fields of working the hay and and
[55:20] Harvesters I would love to go to this
[55:22] big tree and and set that down under it
[55:26] and and look up and I see it's great
[55:28] Mighty uh uh branches Sway in the wind
[55:32] great huge
[55:34] trunk and I said you know I believe that
[55:38] this tree will be here for hundreds and
[55:42] hundreds of years not long ago I took a
[55:46] look at the old tree it's just a
[55:49] snag for here we have no continuing City
[55:53] no nothing here on the earth that you
[55:55] can look at will
[55:57] continue it's got to have an end
[56:00] everything that's smle has to give away
[56:03] to an
[56:04] immortality so no matter how good we
[56:06] build our highways how fine we make our
[56:09] structures it all has to go for here
[56:14] there's nothing can continue just the
[56:16] Unseen is what continues I remember the
[56:20] house that we lived in it was an old log
[56:23] house chinked with mud
[56:25] I perhaps maybe many never seen a house
[56:29] chinked with mud but it was all chinked
[56:32] up with mud and the great huge logs that
[56:36] was in the old house I thought that
[56:39] house would stand for hundreds of
[56:42] years but you know today where that
[56:45] house stood is a housing project it's so
[56:48] much different everything's
[56:52] changing but now I used to see my father
[56:56] he was a rather a short stocky man very
[57:02] strong and he was one of the strongest
[57:05] little man that I knew of I met Mr Coots
[57:08] a fellow that he used to work with in
[57:10] the logs he was a
[57:13] logger and about a year ago and Mr CS is
[57:18] a very good friend of mine Deacon in the
[57:21] First Baptist Church and he said Billy
[57:25] you ought to be a real powerful man and
[57:28] I said no I'm not Mr CS he said if you
[57:31] took after your daddy you would be said
[57:34] I seen that man weighing 140 lbs load a
[57:39] log on the wagon by himself it weighed
[57:41] 900 lb he just knew how to do it he was
[57:45] strong I'd seen come into the place to
[57:49] wash and get ready for dinner when
[57:51] mother would call him and we had an old
[57:56] apple tree out in the front yard and
[57:59] then there was three or four small ones
[58:02] along towards the back and right in the
[58:04] middle tree there was an old Looking
[58:07] Glass that been broke Mar large one and
[58:11] it been tacked on the side of the tree
[58:14] with some Nails bent in kind of like
[58:17] what some of you cartenders listen in
[58:19] would call coat hangers it had been bent
[58:22] in to hold the glass in
[58:25] place there was an old tin comb how many
[58:28] ever seen an old tin the oldfashioned
[58:31] tin comb I can just see it and then
[58:36] there was a little wash bench just a
[58:37] little board with the little sling leg
[58:40] beneath attacked against the tree a
[58:42] little old half sulfur pump there that
[58:45] we pumped the water out and we washed at
[58:47] this old tree and Mama used to take meal
[58:51] sacks and make towels anybody ever used
[58:54] a meal
[58:56] satile well I'm sure I'm feel at home
[59:00] now and those big old rough towels and
[59:03] when she'd give us little kitties a bath
[59:05] she'd feel like she's rubbing a hide off
[59:08] every time she rub and I remember that
[59:12] old meal sack and she'd pull some of the
[59:13] strings out make little tossel to kind
[59:15] of decorate it up how many ever slept on
[59:19] a straw
[59:20] tick well I will say
[59:25] how many ever know what a shuck pillow
[59:29] was well brother Glover I'm at home now
[59:31] sure
[59:32] know straw tick well hasn't been too
[59:35] long since I just come off of one it was
[59:39] oh it's good sleeping cool then the
[59:43] winter time they take the old feather
[59:44] bed and lay on it no and then had to put
[59:46] a piece of canvas over the top of us so
[59:48] cause a snowb blo in the the the cracks
[59:51] in the house you know where the old
[59:52] clapboard shingles and turn up you know
[59:54] when the snow would sweep through it and
[59:57] oh I can remember that very well and
[1:00:00] then pop used to have a shaving brush ah
[1:00:03] now this is going to get you it was made
[1:00:06] out of corn Shooks a shaving brush with
[1:00:09] corn Shooks he'd take mother's old Li
[1:00:11] soap that she had made fix it up and put
[1:00:14] it on his face with this corn Shu brush
[1:00:16] and shave it with a big old straight
[1:00:18] razor on Sunday you take the um the
[1:00:21] pieces of paper stick around his collar
[1:00:24] the four CID collars and put it around
[1:00:27] the collar like this to keep the the the
[1:00:30] lather from getting on his shirt collar
[1:00:32] did you ever see that
[1:00:34] done my m i remember a little Old Spring
[1:00:38] down below where we used to go get a
[1:00:40] drink of water and get our water out of
[1:00:42] an old gourd Dipper how many ever seen a
[1:00:45] gourd
[1:00:47] Dipper well how many of you is from
[1:00:49] Kentucky anyhow well just look at here
[1:00:52] at the Kian well Mom I'm right I thought
[1:00:55] it was all ois and Aries out here but
[1:00:57] look like kuy moving in well they did
[1:01:00] strike ARL in Kentucky few months ago
[1:01:02] you know so maybe that's some of them's
[1:01:04] coming this
[1:01:06] away and then I remember when dad used
[1:01:09] to come in and take his wash for dinner
[1:01:12] he'd roll up his sleeves them little
[1:01:14] short stubby
[1:01:15] arms and when he'd pull up his arms to
[1:01:19] wash throw the water up on his face the
[1:01:22] muscle just wed in his little arm
[1:01:25] and I said you know my daddy will live
[1:01:27] to be 150 years old he was so strong but
[1:01:32] he died at
[1:01:34] 52 here we have no continuing City
[1:01:39] that's right we can not
[1:01:41] continue now let's take a little trip
[1:01:44] all of us there's every one of you here
[1:01:46] that has a life story just as I do and
[1:01:51] it's good to stroll down memories LAN
[1:01:54] once in a while don't you think so just
[1:01:56] go back and let's all go back for a
[1:02:00] while back to similar experiences as a a
[1:02:04] little children and now the first part
[1:02:07] of the life story I'll just give it a
[1:02:11] little touch because it's in the book
[1:02:13] and many of you have the book I was born
[1:02:16] in a little mountain cabin way up in the
[1:02:20] mountains of
[1:02:21] Kentucky they had one room that we lived
[1:02:24] in no rug on the floor not even wood on
[1:02:27] the floor it was just simply a bare
[1:02:30] floor and a stump top of a stump cut off
[1:02:34] with three legs on it that was our
[1:02:36] table and all those little bandoms and
[1:02:40] pile around there and out on the front
[1:02:43] of the little old cabin and W down look
[1:02:46] like where a bunch of possums have been
[1:02:48] W out there in the dust you know all the
[1:02:51] little brothers it was nine of us
[1:02:55] and one little girl and she really had a
[1:02:59] rough time amongst that bunch of boys we
[1:03:01] have to respect her yet today from the
[1:03:04] things that we did in those days she
[1:03:06] couldn't go with us anywhere we'd run
[1:03:07] her back she was a girl so she couldn't
[1:03:10] take it you know so we had and all
[1:03:14] remember that back behind the
[1:03:18] table we had just two
[1:03:21] chairs and they were made out of limb
[1:03:25] bar just Old Hickory uh saplings put
[1:03:29] together and the bottom of them laced
[1:03:32] with Hickory bark did anybody ever see a
[1:03:35] hickory bark chair yet and I can hear
[1:03:38] Mama yet all later on when we got into a
[1:03:41] place where she could have a wooden
[1:03:44] floor with those babies on her lap like
[1:03:47] this and rocking that old chair just
[1:03:49] bang did he bang did he bang on the
[1:03:52] floor I remember to keep the little ones
[1:03:54] from going out the door when she would
[1:03:56] be washing or something she'd lay a
[1:03:59] chair down and turn it kind of catac
[1:04:01] cornered across the door to keep the
[1:04:03] little ones from getting out when she
[1:04:05] had to go spring to get water and so
[1:04:07] forth and mother was 15 years old when I
[1:04:11] was born dad was
[1:04:14] 18 and I was the first of the nine
[1:04:18] children and they told me that the
[1:04:22] morning I was born now we was very poor
[1:04:27] just the poorest a poor and we did not
[1:04:31] even have a window in this little cabin
[1:04:34] it had like a little wooden door that
[1:04:36] you open I doubt whether you ever seen
[1:04:37] anything like that a little wooden door
[1:04:40] that open instead of a window you keep
[1:04:41] it open in the daytime you closed it at
[1:04:43] night we couldn't turn on the electric
[1:04:45] lights or even burn kerosene in those
[1:04:48] days we had what you call a grease lamp
[1:04:52] I don't know whether you ever know what
[1:04:53] a grease lamp was was well what do and
[1:04:56] you ever buy burn a pine knot for just
[1:04:59] take a pine knot and light it and Lay It
[1:05:00] Up on a lid it'll burn and that's smoked
[1:05:04] up a little bit but they had no francher
[1:05:06] anyhow to smoke up so it just the cabin
[1:05:08] got the smokeing it draw good because
[1:05:10] there's plenty of roof up there for it
[1:05:12] to draw through so it um and I was
[1:05:17] barned on April the the 6th
[1:05:20] 19009 of course you know that makes me a
[1:05:23] little over 2 5 now and so uh the
[1:05:26] morning that I was born mother said that
[1:05:32] uh they opened up the window now we had
[1:05:35] no doctors it was a
[1:05:37] midwife just and that Midwife was my
[1:05:41] grandmother and so when I was born and
[1:05:45] my first beginning to cry and and mother
[1:05:50] wanted to see her child and and and she
[1:05:54] more more than a child herself and when
[1:05:57] they open up the little window just at
[1:06:00] the break of day about 5:00 and the
[1:06:04] there was an old Robin
[1:06:06] sitting by the side of a little Bush as
[1:06:09] you all seen the picture of it in in my
[1:06:12] book of my life story an old Robin was
[1:06:16] sitting there just singing for all that
[1:06:18] was in him I've always loved
[1:06:22] Robins now you boys out radio land don't
[1:06:25] shoot at my birds you see they're
[1:06:27] they're they're that my birds did you
[1:06:29] ever hear the legend of the robin how he
[1:06:30] got his red
[1:06:32] breast I'll stop here a moment how he
[1:06:35] got his red breast there was a king of
[1:06:39] kings was dying one day on a cross and
[1:06:42] he was suffering and no one would come
[1:06:45] to him he had no one to help him and
[1:06:49] there was a little brown bird wanted to
[1:06:52] take them Nails out of the cross
[1:06:55] and he kept flying in the cross and
[1:06:57] jerking on those Nails he was too little
[1:07:01] to pull them out and he got his little
[1:07:03] breast all red with
[1:07:06] blood ever since then his breast has
[1:07:09] been red don't shoot him boys let him
[1:07:13] alone he was sitting at the side of the
[1:07:17] window a chirping as the robin singing
[1:07:21] and Dad pushed back the window
[1:07:25] and when they push the little window
[1:07:28] door
[1:07:29] back that light that you see in the
[1:07:32] picture come whirling in the
[1:07:35] window says my mother and hung over the
[1:07:39] bed grandmother didn't know what to say
[1:07:42] now we are was not a religious family my
[1:07:46] people are Catholic I'm Irish on both
[1:07:50] sides my father is strictly Irish
[1:07:52] brandom my mother is Harvey only her
[1:07:55] father married a Cherokee Indian so that
[1:07:59] broke a little line of the blood of the
[1:08:02] Irish and father and mother did not go
[1:08:04] to church and they married out of the
[1:08:07] church and they had no religion at all
[1:08:10] and back there in the mountains there
[1:08:12] was not even a Catholic
[1:08:14] church so they come over in the early
[1:08:16] settlers two Brams come over and from
[1:08:20] that sprung the whole generation of
[1:08:22] Brams as a geny of the family and then
[1:08:27] she opened when they opened this window
[1:08:28] and this light stood in there they did
[1:08:31] not know what to do dad had bought him
[1:08:33] Mama set a new pair of overhauls for
[1:08:35] this event he's standing with the his
[1:08:38] arms in the bib of the old overhauls
[1:08:40] like The Woodsman and loggers used in
[1:08:43] those days and it frightened them well
[1:08:47] after I'd got up maybe 10 days old or
[1:08:51] something they taken me up to a little
[1:08:55] Baptist Church called Possum
[1:08:58] Kingdom Possum Kingdom Baptist Church
[1:09:03] that's quite a name there's an old
[1:09:05] circuit preacher the oldfashioned
[1:09:08] Baptist preacher came through there
[1:09:10] about once every two months on uh the
[1:09:14] people would have a little uh service
[1:09:17] together they go sing some songs but
[1:09:18] they had preaching ever so often on the
[1:09:21] circuit Rider they paid him each year
[1:09:24] with a sack of pumpkins and a few things
[1:09:26] like that you know that the people would
[1:09:28] raised to give it and the old preacher
[1:09:31] came by and there he offered prayer for
[1:09:34] me as a little boy that my first trip to
[1:09:39] church at the year of about something a
[1:09:42] little over two years old the first
[1:09:45] Vision taken place well they had told
[1:09:49] around in the mountains there that this
[1:09:51] light came in so they tried to figured
[1:09:54] up some of them said it must have been
[1:09:55] the sunlight reflecting on a maror in
[1:09:58] the house but there was no maror in
[1:10:00] there and the sun wasn't up so it was
[1:10:03] too early at
[1:10:05] 5:00 and then all they just passed it by
[1:10:09] and when is about uh supposed to be near
[1:10:14] 3 years old now I have to be honest
[1:10:19] there's things here that I do not like
[1:10:21] to say and I wish I could bypass it and
[1:10:26] not have to say it but yet to tell the
[1:10:29] truth you must tell the truth if it's on
[1:10:32] yourself or your people be honest about
[1:10:34] it then it's always the same my father
[1:10:37] was a long way from being a religious
[1:10:40] person he was a typical Mountain boy
[1:10:44] that drank constantly all the time and
[1:10:47] he had gotten in some trouble in a
[1:10:49] fight and there had been two or three
[1:10:52] men almost killed as a fighting shooting
[1:10:55] and cutting one another with knives at a
[1:10:58] some kind of a party up in the mountains
[1:11:00] and dad had been one of the Ring leaders
[1:11:03] of this fight because it had had been a
[1:11:07] friend of his and got hurt and hit
[1:11:10] someone with a chair and had the man had
[1:11:12] a knife out and it was going to cut
[1:11:14] Dad's friend on the floor with this
[1:11:16] knife through his heart and dad took his
[1:11:20] part and it really must have been a
[1:11:22] terrible fight because they from all the
[1:11:25] way down to burksville many miles away
[1:11:28] they sent a sheriff up after Dad
[1:11:31] horback so the man was laying at the
[1:11:33] point of death might be some of his
[1:11:36] people listening in I'm going to call
[1:11:38] his name will yarberry was his name
[1:11:41] probably I think some of them is in
[1:11:42] California if his voice but he was a
[1:11:45] bully great powerful man killed his own
[1:11:48] boy with a fence rail so he he was a
[1:11:51] very powerful and wicked man and so
[1:11:55] there was a great knife fight between he
[1:11:57] and dad and my father almost killed a
[1:11:59] man so he had to run and leave Kentucky
[1:12:02] and come across the river to
[1:12:05] Indiana and um he had a brother that
[1:12:08] lived at the time in Louisville Kentucky
[1:12:10] was the assistant superintendent of the
[1:12:13] wood Mosaic sills in Kentucky in
[1:12:16] Louisville and so Dad come to find his
[1:12:18] older brother dad was the youngest of
[1:12:21] the boys of 17
[1:12:24] children and so he came to find his
[1:12:27] older brother and while he was gone for
[1:12:29] almost a year he could not come back
[1:12:33] because the law was looking for him and
[1:12:36] then
[1:12:37] when we had heard from him by letter
[1:12:41] signed by another name but that he told
[1:12:43] Mother how it would be that she'd hear
[1:12:45] from him and then I remember one day the
[1:12:49] spring this little cabin was just behind
[1:12:52] the house and and during that time after
[1:12:56] there's N9 11 months difference between
[1:12:58] me and my next brother and he was still
[1:13:02] crawling and I had a big rock in my hand
[1:13:04] and I was trying to show him how hard I
[1:13:06] could throw this rock and the old mud
[1:13:09] where the spring had run out of the
[1:13:12] ground and made the muddy ground and I
[1:13:17] heard a bird and it was singing up in a
[1:13:19] tree and I looked up to that tree and
[1:13:22] the bird flew away and when it did a
[1:13:25] voice spoke to
[1:13:27] me I know you think I could not think
[1:13:30] and remember that but the Lord God who
[1:13:35] judge the earth and the heavens and all
[1:13:37] there is knows that I'm telling the
[1:13:39] truth that bird when it flew away a
[1:13:42] voice came from where the bird was in
[1:13:45] the tree like a wind caught in the bush
[1:13:47] and it said you'll live near a city
[1:13:51] called New Albany
[1:13:54] and I've lived from the time I was 3
[1:13:57] years old until this time within 3 miles
[1:14:00] of new albony Indiana I went in and told
[1:14:03] my mother about it well she thought I
[1:14:06] was just dreaming or something later we
[1:14:09] moved to Indiana and father went to work
[1:14:11] for a man Mr Wan a rich man he owns the
[1:14:15] WAN distilleries and he owned a great
[1:14:18] shears his muled millionaire and the
[1:14:21] Louisville Colonels and and baseball and
[1:14:24] so forth and then we live near there and
[1:14:27] dad being a poor man yet he could not do
[1:14:31] without his drinking so he went to
[1:14:33] making whiskey in a in a
[1:14:37] Ste and then it worked a hardship on me
[1:14:40] because I was the oldest of the children
[1:14:43] I had to come and pack water to this
[1:14:46] still to keep those Carls cool while
[1:14:49] they were making the whiskey then he got
[1:14:51] to selling it and then then he got two
[1:14:53] or three of those Stills now that's the
[1:14:55] part I don't like to tell but it's the
[1:14:58] truth and I remember one day from the
[1:15:02] barn coming up to the house crying
[1:15:07] because out at the back of the place was
[1:15:09] a pond where they used to cut ice many
[1:15:12] of you remember when they used to cut
[1:15:14] ice and put it in sawdust that's way Mr
[1:15:16] won kept ice out there in the country
[1:15:19] and father was a a chauffer for him a
[1:15:22] private chauffer
[1:15:23] and when uh this Pond was full of fish
[1:15:28] and when they would go to cutting the
[1:15:30] ice and bring it in and put it in the
[1:15:32] sawdust and when the ice melted in the
[1:15:35] summertime as it went down it was kind
[1:15:37] of clean I suppose more like a lake ice
[1:15:40] and they could use it not to drink but
[1:15:42] to keep water cold put it around the
[1:15:44] buckets and their milk and so forth one
[1:15:47] day packing water from back out at this
[1:15:51] pump which was about a city block
[1:15:54] I was squalling to who wouldn't have it
[1:15:57] because I'd come from school and all the
[1:15:58] boys went out to the pond fishing I just
[1:16:01] love to fish and so they uh all got to
[1:16:05] go fishing but me and I had to pack
[1:16:08] water for this still of course M that
[1:16:10] had to be mom is probation and um uh it
[1:16:15] was such a hardship and I remember
[1:16:18] coming along there with a stump toe I
[1:16:21] had a corn cob wrapped under my toe to
[1:16:24] keep it Out of the Dust did you ever do
[1:16:25] that just put a corn cob under your toe
[1:16:27] like this and wrap a string around it it
[1:16:29] holds your toe right up like a turtle
[1:16:32] head almost you know sticking up you
[1:16:34] could track me everywhere I went with
[1:16:36] this Carn cob under my to stumpage you
[1:16:38] know didn't have any shoes to wear so we
[1:16:41] never wore shoes sometime half the
[1:16:43] winter if we did we it was just what we
[1:16:45] could pick up somebody would give us and
[1:16:48] clo to what somebody charity would give
[1:16:50] us and I stopped under this tree and I
[1:16:55] was sitting there just squalling it was
[1:16:57] in September because I wanted to go
[1:16:59] fishing I had to pack several tubs of
[1:17:01] water with little molasse buckets just
[1:17:04] about that high half a gallon because
[1:17:05] it's just a little lad of about seven
[1:17:08] years old and I plow him in a big tub
[1:17:11] and then go back and get a another two
[1:17:13] buckets and come back pump it that's the
[1:17:15] water we had and there's go to run off a
[1:17:18] batch of that corn whiskey that night
[1:17:21] these men with Daddy up at the house and
[1:17:24] I was crying and all at once I heard
[1:17:27] something making a noise like a
[1:17:29] whirlwind something like this now I hope
[1:17:32] it isn't too loud
[1:17:35] going just a noise like that well it was
[1:17:38] awful quite and I looked around and you
[1:17:42] know what a little Whirlwind I believe
[1:17:44] you call them little Cyclones in the
[1:17:45] fall of the year they pick up through
[1:17:47] the corn feel you know the leaves and so
[1:17:49] forth in the Autumn there the leaves had
[1:17:52] just begin turning and I was under a
[1:17:53] great white popular tree stood about
[1:17:56] halfway between the barn and the the
[1:17:59] house and I heard that noise and I
[1:18:01] looked around it just as quiet as it is
[1:18:03] in this room not a leaf blowing nowhere
[1:18:06] nothing and I thought where's that noise
[1:18:08] coming from well I thought must be away
[1:18:12] from here just a lad and it got louder
[1:18:15] and louder I picked up my little buckets
[1:18:17] and squalled a couple more times and
[1:18:19] started up the lane I was resting and I
[1:18:22] got just a few feet from that out from
[1:18:25] under the branches of this big tree and
[1:18:27] oh my it made a whirl sounding and I
[1:18:31] turned to look and about halfway up that
[1:18:33] tree was another Whirlwind caught in
[1:18:36] that tree just to going around and
[1:18:38] around moving those leaves well I
[1:18:40] thought nothing strange about that
[1:18:42] because it just in that time of year and
[1:18:45] the Autumn why those whirlwinds come
[1:18:48] little we call them whirl winds and they
[1:18:51] uh and they pick up dust you seen them
[1:18:53] on the desert like that same thing so I
[1:18:56] watched but it didn't leave off usually
[1:18:58] it's just a puff for a moment then it
[1:19:00] goes but it had already been in there 2
[1:19:02] minutes or more well I started up the
[1:19:04] lane again and I turned to look at this
[1:19:06] again and when it did a human voice just
[1:19:11] as audible as mine is said don't you
[1:19:14] never
[1:19:15] drink smoke or defile your body in any
[1:19:19] way there will be a work for you to do
[1:19:21] when you get older white like this
[1:19:24] scared me to death you can imagine how a
[1:19:26] little fell felt I dropped those buckets
[1:19:29] and home I went just as hard as I could
[1:19:31] go scream in the top of my voice and
[1:19:34] there was copperheads in that country
[1:19:36] snakes and they're very poison mother
[1:19:39] thought coming alongside the garden I'd
[1:19:41] perhaps got my foot on a copper head and
[1:19:44] she ran to meet me and I jumped up in
[1:19:46] her arm screaming hugging her and
[1:19:47] kissing her and she said what's the
[1:19:50] matter did you get snake bit look me all
[1:19:51] over I said no mama there's a man in
[1:19:53] that tree down there and she said Oh
[1:19:56] Billy Billy come on and she said did you
[1:19:59] stop and go to sleep I said no ma'am
[1:20:01] there's a man in that tree and he told
[1:20:03] me not to drink and not to smoke drink
[1:20:06] whiskies and and things and I was
[1:20:08] packing water to a moonshine still right
[1:20:10] then and he said don't you never drink
[1:20:13] or defile your body in anyway that's
[1:20:15] immoral you know and my child Young
[1:20:18] Manhood with women and to
[1:20:21] my best
[1:20:23] I have never one time been guilty of
[1:20:27] such the Lord help me with those things
[1:20:29] and as they go along you'll find out so
[1:20:32] then don't drink or don't smoke or do
[1:20:37] not defile your body for there will be a
[1:20:39] work for you to do when you get older
[1:20:41] well I told that to Mama and she just
[1:20:44] laughed at me and I was just
[1:20:45] hysterically she called the doctor and
[1:20:48] the doctor said well he's just nervous
[1:20:50] that's all so she put me to bed and I
[1:20:53] never from that day to this ever passed
[1:20:56] by that tree again I was scared I'd go
[1:20:58] down the other side of the garden
[1:20:59] because I thought there was a man up in
[1:21:01] that tree and he was talking to me great
[1:21:04] deep voice that spoke and uh then
[1:21:08] sometime about a month after that I was
[1:21:12] playing Marvels out with my little
[1:21:14] brothers out in front yard and all at
[1:21:17] once I had a strange feeling come on me
[1:21:20] and I stopped and sat down the side of
[1:21:22] the tree and right up on the bank from
[1:21:23] the Ohio river and I look down towards
[1:21:26] Jeffersonville and I seen a bridge rise
[1:21:29] up and go across that of the river span
[1:21:31] the river and I seen 16 men I count them
[1:21:34] had dropped off of there and lost their
[1:21:36] lives on that bridge I run in real quick
[1:21:39] and told my mother and she thought I
[1:21:41] went to sleep but they kept it in mind
[1:21:44] and 22 years of man the municipal bridge
[1:21:48] now many of you cross when you cross
[1:21:50] there crossed the river at the same
[1:21:52] place and 16 men lost their life
[1:21:55] building that bridge across the river
[1:21:57] it's never failed to be perfectly true
[1:22:00] as you see it here in the auditorium
[1:22:02] it's been that way all the time now they
[1:22:05] thought I was just a nervous which I am
[1:22:07] a nervous person that's
[1:22:10] true and if you ever notice people who
[1:22:13] are are inclined to be spiritual are
[1:22:16] nervous look at poets and Prophets and
[1:22:20] look at William kapper who wrote that
[1:22:23] famous song There is a fountain filled
[1:22:24] with blood drawn from emanuel's veins
[1:22:26] did you ever you know this song I stood
[1:22:28] by his grave not long ago brother Julius
[1:22:30] I believe I know yes that's right was
[1:22:32] with us over there and his grave and and
[1:22:35] there after he had wrote that song the
[1:22:37] inspiration left him he tried to find a
[1:22:41] uh the river to commit suicide see the
[1:22:44] spirit left him and people like uh
[1:22:51] uh poets and authors and or not I mean
[1:22:55] prophets look at Elijah when he stood on
[1:22:57] the mountain and called fire out of the
[1:22:59] heaven and called rain out of heaven
[1:23:01] then when the spirit left him he run at
[1:23:03] a threat of a woman and God found him
[1:23:04] pulled back in a cave 40 Days Later look
[1:23:07] at Jonah with enough inspiration when
[1:23:10] the Lord had anointed him to preach
[1:23:11] there in Nineveh till a a city with the
[1:23:15] size of St Louis repented with sackcloth
[1:23:18] and then when the spirit left him what
[1:23:20] happened to him we find him up on the
[1:23:22] mountain n the spirit left him praying
[1:23:24] to God to take his life and see it's
[1:23:28] inspiration and when these things happen
[1:23:30] it it does something to you then I
[1:23:33] remember coming on up I got to be a
[1:23:35] young man I'll hurry to make it within
[1:23:37] the next little bit when I got to be a
[1:23:41] young man I had ideas like all young men
[1:23:45] I going to school I found I'm little
[1:23:48] girls you know I was real bashful you
[1:23:50] know and I I finally got me a little
[1:23:53] girlfriend and U like all little boys
[1:23:56] about 15 years old I guess and and so uh
[1:24:00] oh she was pretty my she had eyes like a
[1:24:03] dove and she had teeth like Pearl and
[1:24:06] neck like a swan and she she was really
[1:24:08] pretty and another little boy he uh we
[1:24:12] were buddies so he got his daddy's old
[1:24:14] Model T Ford and we got a date with our
[1:24:16] girls and we was going to take them out
[1:24:18] riding we got enough to buy two gallons
[1:24:20] of gasoline we had to Jack the back
[1:24:22] wheel up to crank it I don't know where
[1:24:24] you ever remember that or not you know
[1:24:25] to crank it but we we going along pretty
[1:24:28] good and so I had a few nickels in my
[1:24:31] pocket and we stopped at a little place
[1:24:33] and got you could get a ham sandwich for
[1:24:35] nickel and so oh I was rich I could buy
[1:24:39] four of them see and after we'd eat the
[1:24:42] sandwiches and drink the coke I started
[1:24:45] taking the bottles back and to my
[1:24:48] surprise when I come
[1:24:50] out women had just start falling falling
[1:24:52] from Grace at that time for or from
[1:24:54] Womanhood my little Dove was smoking a
[1:24:59] cigarette well I've always had my
[1:25:01] opinion of a woman that would smoke a
[1:25:03] cigarette and I haven't changed it one
[1:25:05] bit from that time on that's right it's
[1:25:07] a lowest thing she can do that's exactly
[1:25:11] right and
[1:25:14] I I now the cigarette company could get
[1:25:17] after me for this but I'm telling you
[1:25:20] that's just a stunt of the devil it's
[1:25:23] the biggest killer in sabotage this
[1:25:25] nation's got I'd rather my boy be a
[1:25:29] drunkard than to be a cigarette smoker
[1:25:31] that's the truth I'd rather see my wife
[1:25:34] laying on the floor drunk than to see
[1:25:36] her with a cigarette that's how now this
[1:25:38] spirit of God that's with me if that is
[1:25:43] the spirit of God as you might question
[1:25:46] you smoking cigarettes has got a slim
[1:25:48] chance when you get there because that
[1:25:50] just every time you notice on the
[1:25:52] platform how he condemns it it's a
[1:25:54] horrible thing keep away from it ladies
[1:25:57] if you have been guilty of that please
[1:25:59] in the Name of Christ get away from it
[1:26:02] it breaks you it'll kill you it it's a
[1:26:06] it's a cancer by the car loads a doctors
[1:26:08] try to warn you and then how they can
[1:26:11] sell you that stuff if you go down to
[1:26:14] the drugstore and say buy I want to buy
[1:26:16] 50 cents worth of cancer why they come
[1:26:19] lock them up but when you buy 50 cents
[1:26:20] worth of cigarettes you're buying the
[1:26:22] same
[1:26:22] thing doctors say so oh this money mad
[1:26:29] Nation it's too bad it's a killer it's
[1:26:32] been proved well when I seen that pretty
[1:26:36] little girl just acting smart this
[1:26:38] cigarette in her uh hand that like to
[1:26:41] kill me cuz I really thought I loved her
[1:26:44] and I thought well I'm called a woman
[1:26:48] hater you know that because I'm always
[1:26:50] kind of against women but not against
[1:26:52] you sisters I'm just against the way
[1:26:54] modern women act that's right good women
[1:26:57] should be packed long but I can remember
[1:26:59] when my father's still up there running
[1:27:02] I'd had to be out there with water and
[1:27:03] stuff I see young ladies that wasn't
[1:27:06] over 17 18 years old up there with man
[1:27:09] my age now drunk and they' have to sober
[1:27:12] him up and give them black coffee to get
[1:27:13] home to cook their husband's supper or
[1:27:17] something like that I said I this was my
[1:27:19] remark then they're not worth a good
[1:27:20] clean bullet to kill him with it that's
[1:27:22] right and I hated women that's right and
[1:27:25] I just have to watch every move now to
[1:27:27] keep them still thinking the same thing
[1:27:29] so but now a good woman is a jewel in a
[1:27:32] man's Crown she should be honored she's
[1:27:36] my mother's a woman my wife is and
[1:27:39] they're lovely and I've got thousands of
[1:27:41] Christian sisters who I highly respect
[1:27:44] but if if they can respect what God made
[1:27:47] them a motherhood and a real queen
[1:27:50] that's all right she's one of the best
[1:27:52] things that God could give a man was a
[1:27:54] wife besides salvation a wife is the
[1:27:57] best thing if she is a good wife but if
[1:27:59] she isn't Solomon said a good woman is a
[1:28:02] jewel in a man's Crown but a a honory
[1:28:05] one or no good one is water in his blood
[1:28:09] and that's that's the worst thing could
[1:28:11] happen so a good woman if you've got a
[1:28:13] good wife brother you ought to respect
[1:28:15] her with the highest that's right you
[1:28:18] should do that a real woman and children
[1:28:21] if you've got a real mother mother that
[1:28:22] stays home and tries to take care of you
[1:28:24] keeping your clothes clean send you to
[1:28:26] school teaching you about Jesus you
[1:28:28] should honor that sweet old mother with
[1:28:30] all that's in you you should respect
[1:28:32] that woman yes sir because she's a real
[1:28:35] mother they talk about the illiteracy of
[1:28:38] Kentucky mountains you see it this your
[1:28:40] dog patch Stu some of them old mammies
[1:28:43] out there could come here to Hollywood
[1:28:45] and teach you modern mothers how to
[1:28:47] raise your kids you let her kid come in
[1:28:49] one night with her hair all messed up
[1:28:51] and lips slips what do you call it
[1:28:54] makeup stuff they put on their face and
[1:28:56] her dress all squeezed to one side and
[1:28:59] been out all night drunk brother she'd
[1:29:01] get one of the limbs off the top of that
[1:29:03] hickory tree and she' never go out no
[1:29:04] more I'm tell she if you had a little
[1:29:07] more of that You' have a better
[1:29:08] Hollywood around here and a better
[1:29:10] Nation that's right it's
[1:29:13] true just try to be modern that's one of
[1:29:16] the tricks of the
[1:29:17] devil now this little girl when I looked
[1:29:21] at her my heart just bled I thought poor
[1:29:24] little fell and she said oh you want a
[1:29:26] cigarette
[1:29:27] Billy I said no ma'am I said I don't
[1:29:31] smoke she said now you said you didn't
[1:29:34] dance they want to go to a dance I
[1:29:35] wouldn't do it so I said there's a dance
[1:29:38] down there what they called Sycamore
[1:29:39] Gardens and I said no I don't dance she
[1:29:43] said now you don't dance you don't smoke

[1:29:49] I said well I like to fish I like the
[1:29:52] hunt that didn't interest her so she
[1:29:57] said take this cigarette now I said no
[1:29:59] ma'am thank you I don't smoke and um I
[1:30:02] standing on the fender they had a
[1:30:04] running board on the Old Forge you
[1:30:05] remember I standing on that Fender

[1:30:43] cigarette out and started to strike the
[1:30:45] match now I know you're now I'm not
[1:30:48] responsible for what you think I'm just
[1:30:50] responsible for telling the truth
[1:30:52] when I start to strike that cigarette
[1:30:55] just as much determined to smoke it as I
[1:30:57] am to pick up this Bible he I heard
[1:31:00] something
[1:31:04] going I tried again I couldn't get to my
[1:31:07] mouth I got to cry and I throw the thing
[1:31:09] down they got to laughing at me and I
[1:31:11] walked home went up through the fields
[1:31:13] sat down out there crying and and it was
[1:31:17] a terrible life remember one day dad was
[1:31:19] going down the river the boys my brother
[1:31:20] and I we had to take a boat and go up
[1:31:22] and down the river hunting bottles to
[1:31:24] put the whiskey in we got a nickel a
[1:31:26] dozen for him to pick him up along the
[1:31:29] river and dad was with me and he had one
[1:31:31] of these little flat I believe about a
[1:31:33] half pint bottles and there's a tree had
[1:31:35] blowed down and dad this man was with
[1:31:37] him Mr darn Bush I had his he had a nice
[1:31:40] boat and I wanted to find favor with him
[1:31:41] because wanted to use that boat it had a
[1:31:43] good Rudder and mine didn't have no
[1:31:44] Rudder at all we had this old boards to
[1:31:46] paddle with and if he'd let me use that
[1:31:48] boat so he done welding and he made the
[1:31:51] steels for Dad so uh he they throw their
[1:31:53] leg up across that tree and Dad reached
[1:31:56] in his back pocket and pulled out a
[1:31:57] little flat bottle of whiskey hand it to
[1:31:59] him he took a drink hand it back to Dad
[1:32:02] and he taking a drink he set it down on
[1:32:04] a little sucker on the side of the tree
[1:32:06] that went out and Mr darn Bush picked it
[1:32:08] up said here you are Billy I said thank
[1:32:11] you I don't drink he said a Brandon and
[1:32:15] don't drink everyone died with their
[1:32:17] boots on and he said uh brandom and
[1:32:20] don't drink I said no sir oh Dad said I
[1:32:22] raised one
[1:32:24] my daddy calling me a
[1:32:27] I said hand me that bottle I pull
[1:32:31] that stopper out the top of it
[1:32:32] determined to drink it when I started
[1:32:34] turn it
[1:32:38] up I hand the bottle back and Tuck off
[1:32:41] down through the field as hard as I
[1:32:42] could
[1:32:43] crying something wouldn't let me do
[1:32:47] it see I could not say well I was any
[1:32:50] good I was determined to do it but it's
[1:32:54] God
[1:32:56] grace Amazing
[1:32:59] Grace that kept me from doing those
[1:33:02] things I wanted to do them myself but he
[1:33:05] just wouldn't let me do
[1:33:07] it later on I found a girl when I was
[1:33:10] about 22 years old she was a
[1:33:13] darling she was a girl that went to
[1:33:16] church German Lutheran her name was brag
[1:33:19] b r u m b a CA come from the name of
[1:33:22] Bram
[1:33:23] ball and she was a nice girl she didn't
[1:33:26] smoke or drink or or she didn't uh dance
[1:33:30] or anything a nice girl I went with her
[1:33:33] for a little while and i' then about 22
[1:33:36] I'd made enough money to I bought me an
[1:33:38] old Ford and uh I we'd go out on dates
[1:33:42] together and so that time there was no
[1:33:44] Lutheran Church close that moved from
[1:33:45] Howard Park up there and so there was a
[1:33:48] minister the one that AR me in the
[1:33:50] missionary Baptist Church Dr Roy Davis
[1:33:53] sister Upshaw the very one that sent the
[1:33:56] brother Upshaw over to me or talk to him
[1:33:58] about me Dr Roy Davis and um so he was
[1:34:03] preaching had the First Baptist Church
[1:34:05] or the U the uh I don't believe it was
[1:34:08] the First Baptist Church either it was a
[1:34:10] Miss called the Missionary Baptist
[1:34:11] Church at Jeffersonville and he was
[1:34:13] preaching at the place at that time and
[1:34:15] we would go to church at night so and
[1:34:18] we'd come back and I never did join
[1:34:21] church but I just like to go with her
[1:34:23] because the main thought was going with
[1:34:25] her I just might as well be honest so
[1:34:28] then uh going with her and one day I she
[1:34:31] is out of a nice family and I begin to
[1:34:33] think you know you know I ought to take
[1:34:36] that girl's time it isn't it isn't right
[1:34:39] because she's a nice girl and I'm poor
[1:34:42] and and I my daddy broke down in health
[1:34:46] and I I there was no way for me to make
[1:34:50] a living for girl like that who had been
[1:34:52] used to a nice home and rugs on the
[1:34:54] floor I remember the first rug I ever
[1:34:57] seen I didn't know what it was I walked
[1:34:59] around the side I thought it's the
[1:35:01] prettiest thing I ever seen in my life
[1:35:03] how would they put something like that
[1:35:04] on the floor it was the first rug I'd
[1:35:06] ever seen it was this one of these I
[1:35:08] believe it's called matting rugs I may
[1:35:10] have had that wrong some kind like
[1:35:11] wicker or something is laced together
[1:35:14] and laying on the floor pretty green and
[1:35:15] red big rows worked in the middle of it
[1:35:17] you know it was a pretty thing and so um
[1:35:20] I remember
[1:35:22] uh I made up my mind that I either had
[1:35:24] to ask her to marry me or I must get
[1:35:28] away and let some good man marry her
[1:35:30] somebody that would be good to her could
[1:35:32] make her a living and could be kind to
[1:35:35] her I could be kind to her but I I I was
[1:35:38] only making 20 cents an hour so I
[1:35:40] couldn't make too much of a living far
[1:35:43] and I with all the family we had to take
[1:35:45] care of and dad broke down in health and
[1:35:48] I had to take care of all them so I was
[1:35:51] having a a pretty rough time so I
[1:35:54] thought well only thing for me to do is
[1:35:56] tell her that I I she I I just won't be
[1:35:59] back because I thought too much of her
[1:36:02] to Wreck her life and to let her fool
[1:36:05] along with me and then I thought if
[1:36:07] somebody could get a hold of her and
[1:36:08] marry her make a lovely home and maybe
[1:36:11] if I couldn't have her I could I could
[1:36:13] know that she was happy and
[1:36:16] so I thought but I I just I just can't
[1:36:20] give her up
[1:36:22] and I I was in an awful shape and day
[1:36:24] after day I'd think about it so I was
[1:36:28] too bashful to ask her to marry me every
[1:36:31] night I make up my mind I'm going to ask
[1:36:33] her and what is that butterflies or
[1:36:37] something get in your all you Brethren
[1:36:39] out there probably had the same
[1:36:40] experience along that and a real funny
[1:36:42] feeling my face would get hot uh I
[1:36:45] didn't know I couldn't ask her so I
[1:36:47] guess you wonder how I ever got
[1:36:50] married
[1:36:51] you know what I wrote her a letter and
[1:36:53] asked her and
[1:36:55] so uh now it wasn't Dear Miss it was a
[1:36:58] little more you know on the love side
[1:37:00] than that it was just not a an agreement
[1:37:03] it was I I wrote it up best I could and
[1:37:06] I was a little afraid of her mother her
[1:37:08] mother was she was kind of rough and uh
[1:37:11] but her father was a gentle old Dutchman
[1:37:14] just a fine old fell he was the
[1:37:17] organizer of the Brotherhood of the
[1:37:18] traan on the railroad making about
[1:37:21] $500 a month and damn times and me
[1:37:24] making 20 cents an hour to Mary's
[1:37:27] daughter I know that would never work
[1:37:29] and her mother was very she's a nice
[1:37:32] lady and she uh she was kind of one of
[1:37:35] these high societies you know and prissy
[1:37:38] like you know and so she didn't have
[1:37:40] much use for me anyhow I was just an old
[1:37:43] plain SAS for ass country boy and she
[1:37:46] thought hope ought to go with a little
[1:37:47] better class of boy and I I think she
[1:37:49] was right and so um but I I didn't think
[1:37:52] it then so I thought well I don't know
[1:37:56] how I can't ask your daddy and I'm sure
[1:37:59] I'm not going to ask your mother and so
[1:38:01] I've got to ask her first so I wrote me
[1:38:03] a letter that morning on the road to
[1:38:04] work I dropped it in the mailbox the
[1:38:06] mail we going to church Wednesday night
[1:38:08] and that's on Monday morning I tried all
[1:38:10] day Sunday to tell her that I wanted to
[1:38:12] get married and I just couldn't get up
[1:38:13] enough nerve so then I dropped it in the
[1:38:16] mailbox and all it worked that day I
[1:38:18] happened to think what if her mother got
[1:38:20] a hold of that letter
[1:38:22] oh my then I know I was ruined if if she
[1:38:25] ever got a hold of
[1:38:27] it cuz she didn't care too much about me
[1:38:31] well I was just sweating it out and that
[1:38:33] Wednesday night when I come oh my I
[1:38:35] thought how am I going to go up there if
[1:38:37] her mother got a hold of that letter
[1:38:38] she'll really work me over so I hope she
[1:38:42] got it I dressed it to hope that was her
[1:38:44] name hope and so I said I'll just ride
[1:38:47] out here to Hope and so and I thought
[1:38:49] maybe she might have not have got a hold
[1:38:51] of of it so I know better to stop
[1:38:53] outside and blow the horn for her to
[1:38:55] come out oh my and any boy that hasn't
[1:38:59] got nerve enough to walk up to the house
[1:39:00] and knock on the door and ask for the
[1:39:02] girl ain't got no business being out
[1:39:03] with her anyhow just exactly right
[1:39:06] that's so silly that's cheap and so I
[1:39:10] stopped my old forge you know and I had
[1:39:12] it all shined up and so I went up
[1:39:15] knocked at the door mercy your mother
[1:39:17] come the door I couldn't hardly catch
[1:39:19] but I said how do you do Miss
[1:39:24] BR she said how do you do
[1:39:29] William
[1:39:30] William and uh and she said will you
[1:39:34] step in I said thank you I stepped
[1:39:38] inside the door I said is uh
[1:39:42] uh hope just about ready and just then
[1:39:45] here come hope skipping through the
[1:39:47] house just a girl at 16 and uh she said
[1:39:51] hi Billy I said hi hope I said you about
[1:39:54] ready for church said just in a minute I
[1:39:57] thought oh my she never got it she never
[1:39:59] got it good good good hope never got it
[1:40:02] either so it'll be all right cuz she'd
[1:40:03] have named it to me so I felt pretty
[1:40:05] fair and then when I got out church I
[1:40:08] happen to think what if she did get it
[1:40:12] see I couldn't hear what Dr Davis was
[1:40:14] saying I look over at her and I thought
[1:40:17] if maybe she's just holding it back and
[1:40:18] she's really going to tell me off when I
[1:40:20] get out of here for asking her that and
[1:40:22] I couldn't hear what Brother Davis was
[1:40:24] saying uh and I look over at her and I
[1:40:26] thought I hate to give her up but and I
[1:40:29] The Showdown sure to come so after
[1:40:32] church we started walking down the
[1:40:33] street together going home and and um so
[1:40:37] we walk to the old Ford and it's all
[1:40:40] along the Moon is shining bright soon I
[1:40:42] look over and she's pretty boy I look at
[1:40:44] her I thought my how I would like to
[1:40:46] have her but guess I can't and so I
[1:40:48] walked on a little further you know and
[1:40:50] I look up at her again I said H how you
[1:40:53] feeling tonight she said oh I'm all
[1:40:56] right and we stopped the old fort down
[1:40:59] we start to get out snow around sidewalk
[1:41:01] around the corner go to her house and I
[1:41:03] was walking up to the door with her I
[1:41:06] thought you know she probably um never
[1:41:09] got the letter so I just might as well
[1:41:11] forget it I'll have another week of
[1:41:12] Grace anyhow so I got feeling pretty

[1:46:38] telling this to my wife last night I
[1:46:40] don't know if it's the first time I ever
[1:46:41] shared with her around Junior High 7th
[1:46:45] e8th grade I thought those that smoked
[1:46:48] were the word back then was cool
[1:46:51] they look cool
[1:46:52] and so there was a little I don't even
[1:46:55] know if my parents know this it might be
[1:46:57] the first time they hear it too there
[1:46:59] was a little place in the back by where
[1:47:01] behind where we liveed was a Lemon Grove
[1:47:03] and it was a little Factory out behind
[1:47:04] that and the guys used to throw their
[1:47:07] mostly smoked cigarettes and I used to
[1:47:09] go pick them up and light them and walk
[1:47:10] around with them but never smoked them
[1:47:13] cuz I thought it was
[1:47:15] cool one day in ninth grade walking we
[1:47:19] we lived close enough that we had to
[1:47:20] walked to school didn't get the bus I
[1:47:22] found a whole pack of
[1:47:25] cigarettes and I thought my sign I hit a
[1:47:27] gold
[1:47:28] mine I'm going to hide it under this
[1:47:31] bush and on the way home I'm going to
[1:47:32] pick it
[1:47:33] up and I did on the way home and I had
[1:47:36] it in my hands and I just said what do
[1:47:39] you want these for and I put it on the
[1:47:40] ground and I crushed them with my foot
[1:47:43] and never touched him
