[34:18] keeps the soul
[34:22] stead fast and sure
[34:25] while the
[34:27] billows roll
[34:30] fastened to
[34:31] the rock
[34:33] which
[34:34] cannot
[34:36] move
[34:37] grounded firm and deep in the
[34:42] savior's love
[34:45] we have an anchor
[34:48] that
[34:49] keeps the soul
[34:53] steadfast and sure
[34:56] while the
[34:57] billows roll
[35:00] fastened to the rock
[35:03] which
[35:04] cannot
[35:06] move
[35:07] grounded firm and deep
[35:10] in the
[35:12] savior's love
[35:14] [Music]
[35:17] i'm gonna ask brother aaron to come and
[35:19] bring the prayer requests we've got our
[35:21] our brother matthew watkins here glad to
[35:24] have him with us and
[35:25] so and his family glad to have you with
[35:28] with us as well
[35:31] but well while brother aaron comes just
[35:33] an announcement something lord's put on
[35:35] my heart is to
[35:37] start having some youth meetings maybe
[35:39] once a month
[35:41] and so lord willing would like to have
[35:43] one
[35:44] this coming friday the 19th
[35:47] have the first one
[35:48] and
[35:50] we'll have we'll start at about 6 30
[35:53] and that night is the same night
[35:56] as one of the prayer nights that we're
[35:58] going to have we're going to have next
[36:00] thursday friday and saturday from six to
[36:03] eight we're going to have people praying
[36:04] in here as they feel led
[36:06] and i thought it would be really nice to
[36:08] have this first youth meeting
[36:10] at the same time for the reason that
[36:14] it would be really nice to have people
[36:15] praying
[36:16] for this and for the youth
[36:19] and so
[36:20] maybe you're not
[36:21] youth anymore
[36:23] but if you'd like to come and pray then
[36:26] then i just believe that the lord would
[36:28] hear those prayers and that he'd really
[36:29] bless it we could start this
[36:31] this off in the right way we just want
[36:34] to be in the lord's perfect will and we
[36:35] don't want anything outside of that but
[36:38] know that
[36:39] he has everything in control
[36:41] and so for this youth meeting
[36:44] what we'd be looking to have is
[36:46] people come around 6 30
[36:49] and then
[36:50] maybe
[36:51] 6 45 just to have a little couple songs
[36:54] a short bible lesson
[36:56] something
[36:57] maybe 20 30 minutes and then after that
[36:59] have some some food and refreshments and
[37:02] some games
[37:03] so
[37:05] if if you know any youth or if you are
[37:07] any youth and you'd like to come
[37:10] the ages are open it the
[37:13] the message would probably be geared to
[37:15] somewhere between like 7 and 25
[37:18] would be kind of the the focused age but
[37:21] if you're younger than seven and you
[37:23] want to come as long as you bring a
[37:24] parent that's okay
[37:26] i can't watch everybody
[37:28] but if if you're younger than seven you
[37:29] want to come
[37:31] as long as you can bring a parent along
[37:32] with you that's great
[37:34] and if if you're older than uh 25
[37:37] that's you're still totally welcome i
[37:39] would say if you get to be over
[37:41] you know 35 40 and you want to come then
[37:44] then just come and talk
[37:46] to me about a way that you can come and
[37:48] help because
[37:49] we want to have
[37:51] this be focused towards the youth
[37:54] so if you're
[37:56] much farther than that then let's let's
[37:58] figure out a way that we can
[37:59] work together and just
[38:02] minister
[38:03] the word of god
[38:05] and
[38:05] minister by our love one to another so
[38:08] if you pray for me i don't i've never
[38:10] done anything like this before but my
[38:12] confidence is not in
[38:13] my ability or my understanding but just
[38:16] that if the lord
[38:17] if it's lord's will that he can
[38:19] guide us and if it's not the lord's will
[38:21] we'll just stop right away
[38:23] as soon as he shows us so if you'd be in
[38:25] prayer for that if you'd like to come
[38:26] and pray for that on
[38:28] on thursday or friday and just get the
[38:31] word out to anybody that would like to
[38:32] come what we're going to do is we're
[38:33] going to send out on the
[38:35] on the church whatsapp we're going to
[38:37] send out a link um that if you'd like to
[38:39] come you could rsvp so we can know how
[38:42] much food to get
[38:44] and then try to get the amount of food
[38:45] there
[38:47] lined up with that and if if anybody
[38:49] would like to bring you know a dessert
[38:50] or a drink then that's totally fine too
[38:52] but we'll
[38:53] we'll supply the food and
[38:56] we'll just look forward to whatever the
[38:57] lord has for that so how many will pray
[38:59] for that
[39:00] [Music]
[39:01] all right well then just believe that
[39:03] the lord will hear those prayers and
[39:04] this will be a good thing
[39:06] so if brother aaron would come let's
[39:09] as as he comes let's sing

[40:49] each one of us
[40:51] there are some needs and some things too
[40:54] sister
[40:56] grace taylor stitch says asking prayer
[40:59] for the boys that
[41:00] started school
[41:02] and asking also for unspoken prayer
[41:04] requests so we know school season has
[41:07] started again and
[41:09] i know the
[41:10] young people going to school from
[41:12] from preschool all the way in high
[41:14] school maybe into college or
[41:16] things like that so
[41:18] remember them in a day like this
[41:20] when so much is happening
[41:23] sister amelia she says unspoken prayer
[41:26] request
[41:27] just she has before the lord so
[41:30] we we trust in him
[41:32] he meets every need
[41:35] we got a
[41:37] phone call
[41:39] friday afternoon for my brother
[41:42] they had taken my dad to the hospital he
[41:44] had fallen was not able to get up
[41:46] and that happened
[41:48] early friday morning
[41:50] and then later again uh
[41:52] about 10 o'clock
[41:54] he tried to stand up to answer the door
[41:56] and he fell he hit his head against the
[41:57] door and was not able to get up
[42:00] as my brother had gone to see dad and
[42:04] so he called an ambulance and they took
[42:05] him to uh
[42:07] the old keno hospital
[42:09] it's a u of a hospital now
[42:12] banner
[42:13] and um
[42:15] i found out he was positive for kobit
[42:17] and that's what caused some of the uh
[42:20] the weakness in his body
[42:23] i got there about three o'clock and
[42:24] stayed with him till about 10 o'clock at
[42:26] night
[42:27] and it was about 6 30 7 o'clock before
[42:29] they got him a bed
[42:30] to test and see what was going on so for
[42:33] some hours we didn't know what was
[42:35] causing
[42:36] the weakness and all but um
[42:39] by about eight o'clock he was beginning
[42:41] to respond well and talk standing up on
[42:43] his own
[42:44] and they took a scan of his his head to
[42:47] make sure it was no injury of his body
[42:50] see if he didn't break any bones
[42:53] but like i said about eight o'clock he
[42:54] was a lot more like dad
[42:56] so we uh we got the word out to some of
[43:00] the brothers we didn't know what to say
[43:01] yet before we would put it out to the
[43:03] church
[43:05] and after the full examination the
[43:07] doctors were confident to let him go
[43:09] home and that it was caused by
[43:11] having covered so
[43:13] got home about 10 30 and when i spoke to
[43:15] him yesterday he was able to take a
[43:17] shower on his own and walk around and
[43:19] all
[43:20] so appreciating the grace of god and
[43:23] he turned 86 on on wednesday and
[43:26] we know that
[43:27] to god that is nothing
[43:30] but
[43:31] mama being
[43:32] legally blind there's not a lot she can
[43:34] do to help at times but
[43:36] my brother does live next door my
[43:38] younger brother so he was there and my
[43:39] older brothers retired so they were able
[43:41] to come and
[43:42] by the time dad went home he was he was
[43:44] a whole lot more like dad and today and
[43:47] yesterday speaking with him
[43:49] um he was doing much better but he said
[43:51] they're going to stay home this week
[43:52] just to be on the safe side and be
[43:54] listening in so
[43:56] i just
[43:57] thank the lord for his grace and for his
[43:59] mercy
[44:01] so since work had been quite so busy and
[44:05] get home late and get leaving sometimes
[44:08] at 5 30 in the morning getting home
[44:09] getting home at six
[44:11] sometimes 6 30 in the evening
[44:13] the yard had gone to a place that was
[44:15] quite
[44:16] quite overgrown all so i put myself to
[44:19] cleaning the yard
[44:21] and i ended up spending five hours
[44:23] yesterday doing everything including
[44:25] going out cleaning the whole alley
[44:26] behind because nobody else would do it
[44:29] and i about passed out
[44:31] um i went to stand up and if i hadn't
[44:33] grabbed something i would have been flat
[44:35] on my face
[44:36] and the only one home was my daughter
[44:38] elizabeth at that time
[44:40] she thought maybe i had a heat stroke
[44:42] but i think it was my blood sugar my
[44:44] salt had dropped
[44:45] it took about a half an hour to recover
[44:48] but thank the lord i'm here this morning
[44:50] so
[44:51] i've made the decision that i can't do
[44:53] five hours of hard work like that

[44:59] this morning we got up and felt felt
[45:01] much better and thank the lord for that

[52:03] always in a war you're in a war uh
[52:05] before uh in in preparation and

[52:32] praise the lord well we want you to turn
[52:34] to romans chapter 7 i just want to bring
[52:36] a prayer request to you and also just
[52:38] share a little testimony that i gave
[52:40] maybe
[52:41] briefly last time i was here
[52:44] just a prayer request that came to me
[52:46] just before
[52:47] this morning just coming out uh from
[52:49] someone that maybe some of you know
[52:52] uh
[52:53] brother michael bailey back in tennessee
[52:55] and his daughter caroline they just
[52:58] diagnosed with
[52:59] hodgkin's lymphoma cancer she's only i
[53:01] think 23 22 23 years old a wonderful
[53:05] family there they go to
[53:07] brother donnie reagan's church back in
[53:09] elizabethton tennessee good friends of
[53:11] ours and family of
[53:13] families at our church and so the
[53:15] brother just asked me to put a prayer
[53:17] request in where i was speaking today so
[53:19] if you remember in your prayer
[53:21] sister caroline bailey
[53:23] diagnosed with cancer and so we believe
[53:25] that jesus is still the great physician
[53:29] how many believers we have here today
[53:31] amen i shared with you a testimony
[53:34] last time i was here of a man and i'll
[53:36] just i'll just read it i actually wrote
[53:39] it out to a brother
[53:40] when the brother texted me that i said
[53:42] let me just share your little testimony
[53:43] and i gave a piece of this to be all
[53:45] right if i just tell that just for a
[53:47] moment
[53:49] back in march uh i was asked by a
[53:51] brother in our church but the travis you
[53:53] know brother travis from the time he
[53:55] visited here and gave his testimony i
[53:57] was asked by brother travis if i would
[53:59] go with him to lay hands and pray for a
[54:01] good friend of his marcus humphrey who
[54:03] had been recently diagnosed with stage
[54:06] four hodgkin's lymphoma cancer the same
[54:08] exact thing that sister caroline the
[54:11] doctors have given a diagnosis of and he
[54:13] was told he only had i think four months
[54:15] it was just a few months to live marcus
[54:19] is the associate pastor of what they
[54:22] call a vineyard church here in buford
[54:24] it's an evangelical church
[54:26] non-denominational
[54:28] he was brother travis's pastor before he
[54:30] came to the message more than 14 years
[54:33] ago the last
[54:35] church is going to you'll know why i'm
[54:36] saying this in a moment the last church
[54:38] in his search for truth that he went to
[54:40] was this vineyard church and marcus had
[54:43] a great impact in his life
[54:45] we went to his home uh where i could
[54:47] tell this is back in april or sometime
[54:49] in that that area that time frame we
[54:52] went to his home where i could tell
[54:53] immediately he was very sick and had a
[54:56] tumor the size of a large grapefruit on
[54:58] his neck brother travis told him that
[55:00] because of his death sentence there was
[55:03] no time to mince words
[55:05] but to be bold and very honest with him
[55:08] and i had met marcus maybe six months
[55:10] prior to this i'd met him
[55:13] you know big tall strong healthy uh he
[55:16] was he's probably in uh he's
[55:19] 70 years young 69 years young but he's
[55:21] real tall healthy uh you know guy
[55:25] real health consciences and and so i'd
[55:28] met him and now seeing him it was just
[55:29] immediately a quite quite a shock that i
[55:32] had you could tell this massive tumor uh
[55:35] was on his neck so brother travis just
[55:37] began there in his living room when we
[55:39] entered in it was not exactly he wasn't
[55:42] you know on a hospital but he's in his
[55:43] living room eating lunch he had another
[55:45] family there in his church from his
[55:47] church that were with him a man and a
[55:48] woman uh and the woman had lost her son
[55:51] to cancer when he was 16 and so she was
[55:54] a real advocate for cancer research and
[55:56] fighting cancer and so we came into this
[55:59] this you know in his living room there
[56:01] and told him we were coming and uh and
[56:03] it you know maybe not the most ideal
[56:05] setting not knowing the man and the
[56:06] woman not knowing the situation brother
[56:09] travis just began to testify and he said
[56:11] brother he said marcus i'm just gonna
[56:13] speak very straight not to hurt your
[56:15] feelings but i'm going to be real honest
[56:16] you know the doctors have because he had
[56:18] just begin to tell us how that you know
[56:20] he knows he's got to die at some point
[56:22] if this is the way it goes and doctors i
[56:24] think had given him four months
[56:27] and so i tell you what there's not a
[56:30] person with bolder faith that i know
[56:32] than brother travis
[56:34] and uh i said afterwards i said man if i
[56:36] was ever in a foxhole i'd want you right
[56:38] at my back
[56:40] just real bold and honest and uh and and
[56:43] but but a wonderful spirit so let me
[56:45] clarify a wonderful loving spirit that
[56:47] travis has on him and so brother travis
[56:50] just begin to testify
[56:52] uh how the lord led him to the truth of
[56:54] the end time message and to the living
[56:56] god who is still alive and living
[56:58] amongst his people he boldly declared to
[57:01] him that the true jesus wasn't living in
[57:03] his denomination denominational church
[57:07] amongst false doctrines like the trinity
[57:09] he mentioned
[57:10] but that god has revealed himself again
[57:12] in the last day through a prophet and
[57:15] restored the original apostolic gospel
[57:18] paul's message
[57:20] with apostolic past power to heal the
[57:22] sick and to raise the dead
[57:25] he shared how this was the fulfillment
[57:27] of scripture and malachi and marcus was
[57:30] very receptive as i'm sure anyone told
[57:32] that they only have four months to live
[57:34] would be
[57:35] and told us when travis after he got
[57:38] done testifying he said now marcus i
[57:40] don't say any of that to to offend you
[57:43] and he says travis he says you you
[57:44] didn't offend me at all he said in fact
[57:47] when you knocked on the door a voice
[57:49] spoke to me and said these are men sent
[57:52] from the lord
[57:54] and he said so before you came up my
[57:56] stairs i already said whatever they have
[57:58] to say lord i'll receive
[58:00] and so immediately when he said that i
[58:02] just felt the presence of the lord right
[58:03] then in that living room dropped down
[58:06] and and he shared how this was the
[58:07] fulfillment told us when we walked
[58:09] through the door lord to him we were
[58:10] sent from right i began to talk to him
[58:12] so after travis shared his testimony i
[58:14] just began to speak
[58:15] and all i did was take a the book that
[58:18] brother branham uh preaches what cancer
[58:21] is and it's titled healings wonderful
[58:23] book and i just began to share the same
[58:25] principles about how the prophets spoke
[58:27] and said that that life that's there is
[58:30] is a uh is a you can be seated i'm sorry
[58:32] i shouldn't hold you stand it i know
[58:33] some of you are leaning over just going
[58:35] to take just another minute but i shared
[58:37] with him how brother branham showed that
[58:38] that tumor was just a life it was a
[58:41] vehicle it was a body it was just the
[58:43] body housing a spirit and brother adam
[58:46] references mark chapter 9 when jesus
[58:48] spoke to the dead deaf and dumb spirit
[58:50] and jesus said i rebuke thee thou deaf
[58:54] spirit
[58:56] he didn't say disease didn't say what
[58:57] the doctors they've looked
[58:59] scientifically they've called it this
[59:00] but jesus said thou spirit thou deaf
[59:03] spirit to come out of the man and don't
[59:05] enter him again
[59:06] and brother branham uses that and said
[59:08] see a cancer is just a life that's
[59:10] living off of your life it's just a
[59:12] there's a spirit it's a demon spirit
[59:14] doctors have given in the name we know
[59:16] that but it's cancer so i'll just begin
[59:18] to testify
[59:19] uh to him
[59:21] about this and i told him when i pray
[59:23] for you i'm not gonna be praying for the
[59:26] tumor itself but i'm gonna be speaking
[59:29] to the life that's living behind the
[59:31] tumor as the doctor and i said marcus
[59:33] doctors have looked with you with all of
[59:35] their tools and they've they've they've
[59:37] used the best of theirs research and if
[59:39] they could use their tools to get the
[59:40] cancer out of you
[59:42] wonderful but i come with a different
[59:44] tool bag today and i said and i'm gonna
[59:47] i'm gonna speak and we're gonna call on
[59:49] the name of jesus and the blood of jesus
[59:51] who you've preached and you've lived for
[59:53] and you've served and given your life i
[59:56] remind him about hezekiah when he's
[59:58] given a death sentence and the bible
[1:00:00] says he prayed that god would add years
[1:00:02] and because of hezekiah's life that he
[1:00:04] had been a servant to the lord god adds
[1:00:06] years to the end of his life
[1:00:08] and so it is testified to him and then i
[1:00:10] begin to show him and testify about
[1:00:12] sister elena but sue many of you may not
[1:00:15] know but may know her testimony from
[1:00:17] brother tim pruitt's church there in
[1:00:19] louisiana and how that she was diagnosed
[1:00:21] also with stage four hodgkin's lymphoma
[1:00:24] and mary marcus's wife had just showed
[1:00:27] me on her phone marcus's pet scan full
[1:00:29] of cancer so i said elena also had the
[1:00:32] same pet scan and i pulled it up it
[1:00:33] matched exactly hers and she looked at
[1:00:36] it and i said here it is and i said you
[1:00:37] see the cancer she said yes i said this
[1:00:39] was after prayer and i showed her the
[1:00:42] pet scan that was
[1:00:43] 100 percent clean
[1:00:46] and you could see tears begin to grip
[1:00:48] her and marcus and they just began you
[1:00:50] could feel just the faith in the room
[1:00:52] raise up i said no god's no respecter of
[1:00:54] persons
[1:00:55] and i said and and and and the sister
[1:00:58] the woman there said well are you saying
[1:01:00] that he has to be healed if my son and i
[1:01:02] said no no no i'm not saying that but
[1:01:04] i'm going to tell you that we're
[1:01:05] believers and there's there's there's
[1:01:07] promises in the bible that are
[1:01:10] applicable and apply to you and and has
[1:01:13] begun to minister there for maybe 25
[1:01:16] minutes
[1:01:17] and you could just feel as faith begin
[1:01:19] to rise we laid hands on him and begin
[1:01:21] to pray with him and i just in my prayer
[1:01:23] reminded the lord lord just as you gave
[1:01:25] hezekiah extending his life here this
[1:01:27] man has preached has stood for you has
[1:01:29] testified not been ashamed of you
[1:01:32] and i just began to pray and that god
[1:01:34] would supernaturally deliver him and
[1:01:36] heal him of this cancer demon that was
[1:01:38] killing him
[1:01:39] and so i prayed we left a month two
[1:01:42] months pass and i know that he's going
[1:01:45] to be you know uh
[1:01:47] we were sort of waiting for a report in
[1:01:48] my living room
[1:01:50] maybe two months about two months later
[1:01:52] brother travis just happened to be at my
[1:01:53] house it stopped in and we were speaking
[1:01:55] and he i remember in the living room he
[1:01:57] pulled out his phone and his eyes got
[1:01:59] about this big and he said and you could
[1:02:02] tell his breath was just taken away he
[1:02:03] said mary
[1:02:05] just texted me and capitals praised the
[1:02:08] living god
[1:02:09] marcus has been supernaturally healed
[1:02:12] and is 100 percent cancer free the
[1:02:15] doctor said it was the most aggressive
[1:02:18] cancer he's ever seen and then it
[1:02:21] miraculously was gone
[1:02:30] praise the lord that's our god
[1:02:33] the doctor said the doctor cried and
[1:02:35] cried mary's texting she said the doctor
[1:02:37] cried and said marcus this truly is a
[1:02:39] miracle we just found out last week that
[1:02:41] man marcus took his doctor to a san nats
[1:02:45] which is a minor league baseball team in
[1:02:47] savannah georgia with thousands of
[1:02:49] people got behind the microphone and for
[1:02:51] 40 minutes with his doctor beside him
[1:02:54] testified about a living god and how god
[1:02:56] healed him of cancer
[1:02:58] now if god could do that for that man
[1:03:00] how much more could he do it for sister
[1:03:02] carolyn bailey amen could you stand to
[1:03:04] your feet could you give the lord
[1:03:05] another hand clap of praise he's worthy
[1:03:07] he's the same come on friends give him a
[1:03:10] real
[1:03:10] hand clap of praise he's worthy of it
[1:03:14] amen
[1:03:15] so you be in prayer for that be in
[1:03:17] prayer for us as we go to visit him he's
[1:03:19] been uh we've been de waiting because of
[1:03:21] his he's getting the strength back but
[1:03:23] we're going to go and witness to him
[1:03:24] further and just believe that god's
[1:03:26] going to do something romans chapter 7
[1:03:28] amen we just want to continue
[1:03:31] uh here this morning and i know that we
[1:03:33] have an evening service so we'll try to
[1:03:35] pull the parachute
[1:03:36] when we get about just a little ways in
[1:03:39] and feel like it's a good time good to
[1:03:41] see all of your faces amen good to be in
[1:03:43] the family of god aren't you glad to be
[1:03:45] a part
[1:03:47] i spoke the last time i was here and i'm
[1:03:49] going to take just a skip from that just
[1:03:52] a
[1:03:53] thought right along the same lines i
[1:03:55] spoke entitled being changed and i've
[1:03:57] ministered this in five parts uh took my
[1:04:00] title from brother branham when in
[1:04:01] standing in the gap when he says that
[1:04:04] the note that he puts there for brother
[1:04:06] roy who had the dream and he said me
[1:04:08] being changed so i spoke on being
[1:04:10] changed i'm going to speak to you i'm
[1:04:12] going to title this the real you the
[1:04:14] real
[1:04:15] you let's just begin in romans chapter 7
[1:04:19] and let's just begin
[1:04:20] verse
[1:04:21] 17.
[1:04:24] now then it is no more i that do it
[1:04:27] but sin that dwelleth in
[1:04:29] me now i'm just going to take a moment
[1:04:31] to lay some teaching groundwork so you
[1:04:34] know right where i'm at this morning
[1:04:36] i want you to key in on this word me
[1:04:39] because we're going to speak on the real
[1:04:40] you
[1:04:42] and so there's a complexity
[1:04:45] to you
[1:04:46] that is deeper
[1:04:47] than what you see in the mirror
[1:04:51] and when you understand that it helps
[1:04:52] you understand the attack of the devil
[1:04:55] in your life when you understand you
[1:04:57] better
[1:04:58] and you understand the way that you're
[1:04:59] made up that there's a there's a
[1:05:01] complexity to a believer
[1:05:04] that's not just what we see every day
[1:05:06] and not what you deal with every day and
[1:05:08] what you look in the mirror but there's
[1:05:09] more to you
[1:05:11] than you
[1:05:14] and let me just make a statement i'm
[1:05:15] going to say this and it's going to
[1:05:17] maybe be a little bit paradoxical
[1:05:19] the holy ghost when the holy spirit by
[1:05:21] the true new birth comes into your life
[1:05:24] it changes everything
[1:05:26] the bible said who's ever in christ is a
[1:05:28] new creation creation he's a new
[1:05:30] creature so the holy ghost changes
[1:05:32] everything but
[1:05:34] the holy ghost doesn't change everything
[1:05:39] now it's a little bit paradoxical but
[1:05:40] just hold on with me don't throw any
[1:05:42] stones yet
[1:05:44] the holy ghost changes everything but it
[1:05:46] doesn't change
[1:05:48] everything
[1:05:50] there's a part of you that has been
[1:05:52] changed there's a part of you that is
[1:05:54] being changed
[1:05:56] and one day the holy ghost will change
[1:05:59] everything
[1:06:00] hallelujah paul caught it the down
[1:06:02] payment the earnest when the fullness of
[1:06:04] adoption to wit the redemption of the
[1:06:07] body we know that hasn't taken place now
[1:06:09] let's look here i know that verse 17
[1:06:11] that is no more i that do it but sin
[1:06:12] that dwelleth in me for i know that in
[1:06:15] me now notice the parentheses here and
[1:06:17] if you have a scofield or a king james
[1:06:19] bible that is in my flesh so paul makes
[1:06:23] a distinction there's a complexity here
[1:06:25] it's not just as simple as saying sin
[1:06:27] dwelleth in me but i'm going to clarify
[1:06:29] that is
[1:06:31] in my flesh
[1:06:33] dwelleth no good thing
[1:06:38] for to will is present with me but how
[1:06:40] to perform that which is good i find not
[1:06:42] for the good that i would i do not but
[1:06:44] the evil which i would not that i do now
[1:06:47] if i do that i would not it is no more i
[1:06:49] that do it but sin that dwelleth in me i
[1:06:54] find then a law
[1:06:58] when i would do good evil
[1:07:01] evil
[1:07:03] evil right here in your mind
[1:07:06] in your human spirit is with me for i
[1:07:10] there's another part of me
[1:07:12] for i delight in the law of god
[1:07:16] this is my delight david said as my
[1:07:18] portion how many believers could testify
[1:07:20] this is what i delight in for i delight
[1:07:23] in the law of god after the
[1:07:25] inward man but i see another law and my
[1:07:29] members warring against the law of my
[1:07:32] mind and bringing me into captivity to
[1:07:34] the law of sin which is in my members a
[1:07:37] wretched man what a good description
[1:07:40] a wretched man that i am
[1:07:42] who shall deliver me from the body of
[1:07:44] this death i thank god and paul i thank
[1:07:46] god too through jesus christ our lord so
[1:07:49] then with the mind i myself serve the
[1:07:51] law of god but with the flesh the law of
[1:07:54] sin lord we just raise our hands as a
[1:07:57] body of believers here asking lord god
[1:08:00] we just want to say lord we're we're
[1:08:02] ready to receive what you have for us
[1:08:06] lord i pray that you would give us good
[1:08:08] ground good soil lord that could bring
[1:08:11] forth the fruit of christ in our life
[1:08:14] that's our prayer lord may your word
[1:08:16] lord it's a seed may it fall in good
[1:08:18] ground this morning be with every heart
[1:08:21] with the sick and the afflicted in mind
[1:08:23] body and spirit may you touch them this
[1:08:25] morning we ask it lord for sister
[1:08:27] carolyn bailey lord we just know that
[1:08:30] you're the same yesterday today and
[1:08:32] forever lord you're the same today as
[1:08:34] you was when you healed marcus the same
[1:08:37] when you healed elena lord and you're
[1:08:39] the same god here today for sister
[1:08:41] carolyn lord i pray that you would touch
[1:08:43] her in a supernatural way we join our
[1:08:45] faith together with thousands around the
[1:08:47] world praying for her right now
[1:08:50] now come and touch us lord this morning
[1:08:52] for we're in great need of you we ask it
[1:08:55] in jesus christ's name
[1:08:57] and and the church said
[1:08:59] amen you can be
[1:09:04] seated i know that in me i'm gonna just
[1:09:08] take you straight to your powerpoint
[1:09:10] brother jordan if you have that and you
[1:09:12] can go ahead and display that brother
[1:09:13] branham's answers this question and the
[1:09:15] man asked this question in uh in
[1:09:18] questions and answers in 1964
[1:09:21] and the man asked the question and he
[1:09:23] references romans 7 the portion that we
[1:09:25] just read and i want you to notice the
[1:09:27] very last line there on your screen is
[1:09:30] his question after quoting romans 7.
[1:09:33] this
[1:09:34] i cannot understand let me just kind of
[1:09:37] polish it up so you can see
[1:09:40] in me
[1:09:41] is two
[1:09:42] persons
[1:09:44] right one wants me to do wrong the other
[1:09:47] wants me to do and the prophet's gonna
[1:09:49] say right and every time i start to do
[1:09:52] right then the wrong hinders me how many
[1:09:56] of you people on the interviews this
[1:09:58] afternoon has run that same thing
[1:10:02] incredible insight to something we don't
[1:10:04] have on tape but the prophet begins to
[1:10:06] tell how that in private interviews
[1:10:08] people were struggling with the same
[1:10:10] exact question i've been born of the
[1:10:13] spirit i believe that i've been changed
[1:10:15] i believe that god has completely
[1:10:18] changed me but somehow i still struggle
[1:10:22] to have the victory
[1:10:25] and how many believers would be honest
[1:10:26] and say brother branham i got the same
[1:10:28] question this morning how many of you
[1:10:30] running the same
[1:10:31] problem this afternoon is run the same
[1:10:33] thing this morning see
[1:10:35] notice we are carnal and that part must
[1:10:38] perish but then
[1:10:40] inside we are spirit we are a spirit man
[1:10:44] now the prophet takes time and he uses
[1:10:46] in greatest battle of her fault and if
[1:10:48] you study that message it's just so so
[1:10:50] wonderful gives you good ammunition for
[1:10:52] the devil because you realize in that
[1:10:55] message that the greatest battle that
[1:10:57] you face
[1:10:58] is not just calling yourself a believer
[1:11:01] because we all can do that this morning
[1:11:03] the greatest battle you ever face won't
[1:11:05] even be to get to church but the
[1:11:07] greatest battle you'll ever face is
[1:11:10] believing what the word has said about
[1:11:14] you with real genuine faith
[1:11:17] the greatest battle ever fault the
[1:11:19] prophet says you're made up of body
[1:11:21] which is a which is made up of five
[1:11:23] senses what you see what you hear what
[1:11:25] you taste what you feel what you smell
[1:11:27] and then beyond that he draws a circle
[1:11:29] and says and inside of that body you
[1:11:31] have a human spirit and that spirit has
[1:11:34] five senses memory conscience reasoning
[1:11:37] imaginations
[1:11:39] affections
[1:11:41] and then beyond that realm is a little
[1:11:43] realm called the soul and the prophet
[1:11:46] says it this way that's the real you
[1:11:50] in other words what you see on the
[1:11:52] outside what you see on the inside of
[1:11:54] the spirit and what you see on the soul
[1:11:56] that real true seed gene of god that god
[1:12:00] placed in you before the foundation of
[1:12:02] the world that's the real
[1:12:05] you
[1:12:06] and that real part of you really loves
[1:12:08] the word of god that part of me believes
[1:12:11] the word of god
[1:12:12] that part of me stands with the word of
[1:12:14] god that part of me has faith in the
[1:12:16] promises of god it's this part of me
[1:12:19] that gives me so much trouble
[1:12:22] so within that complexity of the human
[1:12:24] spirit brother adam says you have memory
[1:12:26] conscience reasoning imagination
[1:12:28] affection and he says and in there you
[1:12:30] have channels
[1:12:31] and he says and then what happens to so
[1:12:34] many blowed up christians as they never
[1:12:36] clear out the channels
[1:12:40] and he says just like a boiler and a
[1:12:42] water heater and he says then the flu
[1:12:43] gets clogged up and it's clogged up in
[1:12:46] its memory and its imagination and its
[1:12:48] bitterness and jealousies and envies and
[1:12:50] fears and phobias and all kinds of
[1:12:53] things that are bottled up into what
[1:12:55] make you which are based upon your
[1:12:57] life's experiences and brother branham
[1:12:59] says but god not only does he have to
[1:13:01] clean sin out of your soul and i'm so
[1:13:04] glad we have an atonement to where he
[1:13:06] can clean sin out of me but also you've
[1:13:09] got to let the holy spirit come and
[1:13:10] clean your memory come and clean your
[1:13:12] conscience come and clean your
[1:13:14] imaginations your affections how many
[1:13:16] can say lord i want your holy spirit to
[1:13:19] clean every part of me
[1:13:22] so that there's no hindrance to believe
[1:13:24] the word
[1:13:27] so there's a part of you notice what he
[1:13:28] says here and inside that is faith in
[1:13:31] god's word then we bring our outside
[1:13:34] body
[1:13:35] under subjection that's an important
[1:13:38] word
[1:13:39] to the word by faith by how accepting
[1:13:43] what god said
[1:13:45] how can i take a cocker barrel and make
[1:13:47] a grain of wheat out of it it's
[1:13:49] impossible for me to do it the only way
[1:13:52] it can be is because inside that
[1:13:54] cocklebur
[1:13:56] has been transmitted from a cockleboro
[1:13:58] weed a cockaboard to a germ called wheat
[1:14:00] life then you bury that cockle burr and
[1:14:02] it'll produce a grain of wheat
[1:14:06] because there has been a life of wheat
[1:14:08] put in the cockle borer and the life of
[1:14:10] the cockleboro has been taken out notice
[1:14:12] but the nature of the cocklebur is still
[1:14:16] sticky and it will be until this new
[1:14:18] life has fully been i love those words
[1:14:21] has fully been this is how the prophet
[1:14:24] answers this question romans 7.
[1:14:27] in inside of you is two people
[1:14:30] and when you get the baptism of the holy
[1:14:32] ghost that doesn't change
[1:14:36] unless your body's changed how many here
[1:14:38] have new bodies maybe by a show of hand
[1:14:40] nobody you still got aches still got
[1:14:42] pain still get headaches
[1:14:44] still sleepy fight sleep in church when
[1:14:45] the preacher's preaching still struggle
[1:14:47] with the with the things of the world
[1:14:48] how many be honest
[1:14:51] brother branham says here's this here's
[1:14:53] the key
[1:14:54] your nature has been changed on the
[1:14:56] inside but the outside is still sticky
[1:15:00] and you say when will it not be sticky
[1:15:03] until this new life has been fully
[1:15:07] has fully been
[1:15:09] developed
[1:15:10] so what is happening right now when you
[1:15:12] believe the word of god is you serve the
[1:15:14] lord you're being developed from this to
[1:15:18] what's inside of here
[1:15:20] say brother matt what what what do i got
[1:15:22] to do add to your faith knowledge add to
[1:15:25] your knowledge virtue add to your
[1:15:27] knowledge under your virtue temperance
[1:15:29] and patience and godliness and brotherly
[1:15:31] kindness jesus the bible says let this
[1:15:33] mind which was in christ be in you that
[1:15:36] means you've got a choice to allow
[1:15:39] the things of god to dwell in you
[1:15:43] and you feed upon those things
[1:15:45] he says it's fully been developed out of
[1:15:47] the ground and raised up again when it
[1:15:49] comes forth now he's speaking of the
[1:15:51] resurrection he's speaking of the body
[1:15:52] change then it's no more cocklebur but
[1:15:55] wheat but while it's here on earth
[1:16:00] and out of the earth because the curse
[1:16:03] was upon the earth and a cocklebur it's
[1:16:07] still
[1:16:08] sticky
[1:16:10] but it's got the nature on the inside of
[1:16:13] wheat
[1:16:14] and as long as you're in this life
[1:16:18] you're going to be sticky and have a
[1:16:20] carnal nature that's going to bother you
[1:16:23] as long as you
[1:16:25] live
[1:16:27] when will it not bother me brother matt
[1:16:29] when you turn 18
[1:16:32] for the second time
[1:16:37] yeah now let's you're catching it
[1:16:40] when you when you turn 18 19 years old
[1:16:43] for the second time then it won't be
[1:16:45] bothering you anymore
[1:16:47] but we shall know him as we are known
[1:16:49] paul said i know we know not what we
[1:16:51] shall be but we know this when he doth
[1:16:53] appear we shall be like him in his
[1:16:57] very image
[1:16:59] well i'm looking forward to that day and
[1:17:02] he says it's still sticky but it's got
[1:17:03] the nature on the end no no but the
[1:17:05] inside of you you're born again and when
[1:17:07] you're raised up you're in the likeness
[1:17:08] of christ and all the sin is gone from
[1:17:10] you that's the thing i love that
[1:17:13] somebody told me this is the the old
[1:17:14] indian chief i'm just going to skip just
[1:17:16] to save time we're going to go through
[1:17:18] some of these this is when brother
[1:17:19] branham tells the story the white dog
[1:17:20] the black dog which one wins let's just
[1:17:22] skip down here and he said he said said
[1:17:25] well chief which one of them wins the
[1:17:26] fight that depends on which one chief
[1:17:28] feeds the most so i think that's a good
[1:17:30] answer here there just depends on the
[1:17:33] warring of the body that's in you it
[1:17:36] depends on which one you cater to
[1:17:39] which nature you cater to
[1:17:42] the carnal nature after the things of
[1:17:44] the world or the spiritual nature after
[1:17:47] the things of god that
[1:17:50] does it
[1:17:52] you know we make overcoming a lot more
[1:17:54] complicated than it has to be it's
[1:17:55] really that simple whichever one you
[1:17:59] cater to the most
[1:18:01] so there's a part of you i'm going to
[1:18:03] read a quote here in a moment i'm just
[1:18:05] going to reference it here brother
[1:18:06] brandon says when a man's born he's born
[1:18:08] with a hole in his heart he's born with
[1:18:10] a void that needs to be filled and he
[1:18:13] says and then the lord begins to give
[1:18:15] him we're going to spend time on just a
[1:18:17] moment but he says the lord begins to
[1:18:19] give him a mother and he feels the love
[1:18:21] of that mother and then a father and he
[1:18:23] fills that place but even after that
[1:18:26] person is born of the spirit of god as
[1:18:28] romans 7 i know romans 8 that he that
[1:18:31] there now is no condemnation to them
[1:18:33] which are in christ which walk not after
[1:18:35] the flesh but after the spirit i
[1:18:36] understand when you're born of the
[1:18:38] spirit of god you're a changed person
[1:18:40] you're a new creation old things are
[1:18:43] dead
[1:18:44] all things are become new but yet
[1:18:46] there's still a part of you that is
[1:18:48] being changed and let me just stop here
[1:18:50] and say you cannot stop you cannot pause
[1:18:55] i don't care how far the lord has
[1:18:57] brought you in christ in maturity you're
[1:19:00] in need of something to be changed this
[1:19:03] morning
[1:19:06] you've got to constantly be changing
[1:19:11] a holy ghost-filled christian born of
[1:19:13] the spirit of god can still struggle
[1:19:15] with things he struggles with him you
[1:19:17] know what he's struggling with himself
[1:19:21] he's struggling with that part of him
[1:19:23] that's not been changed
[1:19:26] and oftentimes
[1:19:28] what hides
[1:19:29] the real problem is pride
[1:19:33] oftentimes in a marriage when there's a
[1:19:35] man and a woman and there's struggle and
[1:19:37] there's fightings and there's warrants
[1:19:38] usually the real problem the real cause
[1:19:42] is covered over and hidden in plain
[1:19:44] sight because of pride
[1:19:46] and if someone a believer especially
[1:19:48] could just lay down their pride swallow
[1:19:50] their pride and recognize it and admit
[1:19:53] it's not my brother it's not my sister
[1:19:55] it's me o lord standing in the need of
[1:19:57] prayer the zilla of the hour
[1:20:00] to say i'm wrong i repent notice this
[1:20:02] this is martin luther
[1:20:04] i am more afraid of my own heart
[1:20:08] than of the pope and all his cardinals
[1:20:12] i have within me
[1:20:15] the great
[1:20:16] pope self
[1:20:20] listen to what brother madam says you
[1:20:22] know who the biggest enemy i got is
[1:20:24] william branham he's always in god's way
[1:20:28] if i can just get him out of the way
[1:20:30] then god can go to work that's your
[1:20:34] worst
[1:20:35] enemy
[1:20:36] is yourself
[1:20:39] just get yourself out of the way
[1:20:42] and then god can go to work
[1:20:44] power of decision 1955 you find out
[1:20:46] you're the biggest enemy you've got if i
[1:20:49] could get william branham out of the way
[1:20:51] jesus can have a wonderful time if we'd
[1:20:54] be honest here this morning we'd say the
[1:20:55] same thing we'd swallow our pride and
[1:20:57] say if i could just get myself out of
[1:20:59] the way
[1:21:01] jesus could have a wonderful time in my
[1:21:03] children and my marriage and my home and
[1:21:05] my health and my job but my biggest
[1:21:07] enemy
[1:21:08] is me
[1:21:11] can you say amen
[1:21:12] the interval and a man never knows what
[1:21:15] it is to live a victorious life until
[1:21:16] he's complete he's completely overcome
[1:21:19] who
[1:21:23] himself
[1:21:25] man never knows what it is to live a
[1:21:27] victorious life until he's completely
[1:21:29] overcome who himself
[1:21:32] that's the biggest enemy you got is your
[1:21:36] self that's the reason you can't rise up
[1:21:40] in faith because of little bugs and
[1:21:43] little things you take covet as just a a
[1:21:46] thing that's
[1:21:48] just the fear of it uh more than you
[1:21:50] know people today
[1:21:52] never maybe you got sick with cover
[1:21:54] there's other been people who have died
[1:21:55] from it but there's been others who've
[1:21:57] never really been affected by the
[1:21:58] disease in a great way still here today
[1:22:01] maybe you've had covert three or four
[1:22:03] times and took a vaccine three or four
[1:22:05] times but you still got covet you know
[1:22:07] people
[1:22:08] maybe never you never really were
[1:22:11] severely affected by covid the disease
[1:22:15] but the fear of a pandemic you ingested
[1:22:18] in your human spirit and it's done more
[1:22:21] damage than the disease ever could
[1:22:25] well it's true
[1:22:27] because you ingest things into your
[1:22:30] human spirit
[1:22:32] all the way from the time you're a
[1:22:34] little boy a little girl remember i made
[1:22:36] the statement last time uh that i was
[1:22:38] here your adult life is mostly a
[1:22:41] reaction to your childhood
[1:22:45] when you understand that it's real it's
[1:22:47] very liberating
[1:22:48] your adult life is mostly just a
[1:22:50] reaction to your childhood things that
[1:22:52] you experienced that you never should
[1:22:55] have
[1:22:56] and now they affect you in a marriage or
[1:22:58] in a father and a mother to a child the
[1:23:01] things that you did experience the
[1:23:03] things that you didn't maybe love and
[1:23:05] affection that you should have received
[1:23:07] or nurtured that you never did and now
[1:23:09] you grow up you cover that over and you
[1:23:11] cover that over you're born of the
[1:23:13] spirit of god you meet the lord jesus
[1:23:15] you get filled with the baptism of the
[1:23:17] holy ghost but still
[1:23:18] inside that human spirit still inside of
[1:23:21] that nature still inside of that
[1:23:23] subconscious there's a there's a an
[1:23:26] issue maybe something a disease
[1:23:29] spiritually that you've taken on
[1:23:32] it's still there and when people step on
[1:23:35] that pain ouch and it hurts
[1:23:40] so you see you're made up more than just
[1:23:43] you more than just what meets the eye
[1:23:45] the biggest enemy you got is yourself
[1:23:49] right
[1:23:51] this one brother branham says i want to
[1:23:52] ask you something how many in here knows
[1:23:54] you've got a subconscious don't you
[1:23:59] read it again i want to ask you
[1:24:00] something how many in here ever ever you
[1:24:01] know you've got a subconscious don't you
[1:24:04] we are conscience of that
[1:24:07] that's the fellow
[1:24:09] that subconscious is causing you all the
[1:24:12] trouble tonight
[1:24:15] it don't agree with this one out here
[1:24:18] it gets scared and backs up but when it
[1:24:21] becomes in harmony with this one i
[1:24:24] believe brother adam's preaching about
[1:24:26] the seed
[1:24:27] when it comes in harmony with this one
[1:24:30] and this one becomes in harmony with
[1:24:31] god's word
[1:24:33] you're going then
[1:24:35] so the trouble is what's in your
[1:24:36] conscience what's in your subconscious
[1:24:38] the things that you've taken in
[1:24:40] that's why that's why that thing bothers
[1:24:42] you that doesn't bother her
[1:24:46] and that's why that thing bothers you
[1:24:47] that doesn't bother him you're different
[1:24:50] you're complex you're made up of all of
[1:24:52] your experiences when you're born of the
[1:24:54] spirit of god what changes brother
[1:24:56] branham and future home paints it out on
[1:24:57] the board draws it out the snake that's
[1:24:59] inside of the heart that old nature and
[1:25:02] he says that man is calling pushing the
[1:25:04] buttons he's like the little man down on
[1:25:06] the ship a massive cruise ship but
[1:25:08] inside of that cruise ship is a little
[1:25:10] bitty tiny room and inside of that
[1:25:13] little tiny room is just a little bitty
[1:25:15] man and he's pulling the lever
[1:25:18] and he's pushing the buttons and that
[1:25:19] entire ship is turning based upon his
[1:25:21] commands and brother branham says when
[1:25:23] you're not when you before you're born
[1:25:25] again baptism of the holy ghost that
[1:25:27] little man is a nature that you're born
[1:25:29] with the carnal nature and he's calling
[1:25:31] the shots but when you receive the holy
[1:25:33] spirit that snake is removed and the
[1:25:36] lamb the dove of god the holy spirit
[1:25:39] comes in and dwells in the human heart
[1:25:42] upon the throne room of the heart
[1:25:47] you remember the story but the brother
[1:25:48] tells about brother and when he
[1:25:50] references the picture the old indian
[1:25:52] nature behind him and and he uses the
[1:25:54] example that when you he says when the
[1:25:56] holy ghost comes into your heart he says
[1:25:58] it burns out that old nature
[1:26:01] it burns out and he says and that that
[1:26:03] that snake that was on the heart that
[1:26:06] spirit that that that that that spirit
[1:26:09] that was reigning that was ruling your
[1:26:11] life that was on the throne of your
[1:26:13] heart and he says now he's removed and
[1:26:16] jesus is on the throne of your heart
[1:26:18] but what happens to that spirit that was
[1:26:21] on the throne of your heart he moves
[1:26:23] from the throne of the heart and he
[1:26:25] moves to a place of influence
[1:26:31] and now he whispers in your ear
[1:26:33] you're not born again you don't have the
[1:26:35] holy ghost
[1:26:37] you don't even know the lord you're not
[1:26:39] a seed of god you're not part of the
[1:26:41] elected family of god
[1:26:44] you'll never make it oh is he am i the
[1:26:46] only one he whispers that to
[1:26:50] let me tell you something that's not
[1:26:52] jesus talking to you
[1:26:55] and you've got to learn to discern the
[1:26:57] voices and cast down the vain
[1:27:00] imaginations
[1:27:04] so he's brother madam says but what
[1:27:06] happens now now he's on the throne of
[1:27:08] the heart now jesus is there but notice
[1:27:11] brother madam deals and we we don't want
[1:27:13] to take time but he deals with a
[1:27:14] situation situation of a woman that's
[1:27:16] been told and she's heart trouble and
[1:27:18] and brother adam says it's what is it
[1:27:19] and he falls into this german you go see
[1:27:21] it on 20th century prophet and he says
[1:27:23] oh oh it's a lie someone's told a lie on
[1:27:25] you they said you were a witch that's a
[1:27:27] pastor claiming divine healing he's
[1:27:29] dealing with polio right now sister on
[1:27:31] the tape begins to cry yes that's right
[1:27:32] brother branham and he says you're not a
[1:27:34] witch you're a daughter of god and you
[1:27:37] can hear that woman immediately free and
[1:27:39] now heart trouble is free her spirit's
[1:27:41] liberated why was she not born again no
[1:27:45] she was born of the spirit of god but
[1:27:47] there was a lie that she had ingested
[1:27:49] that was told about her and it was
[1:27:51] affecting her body
[1:27:55] we gave example after example of that in
[1:27:57] the prayer line brother branham would
[1:27:58] deal with a woman who was chased by a
[1:27:59] dog when she was a little girl and now
[1:28:01] she's dealing with nervousness and a
[1:28:03] heart condition so he says that's the
[1:28:05] problem that's scared and backed up but
[1:28:07] when it becomes the harm of this one
[1:28:08] then you're going then
[1:28:11] notice what brother branham says here in
[1:28:12] america it never to work disregarded so
[1:28:14] much teaching in america so many
[1:28:15] different teachings to one has their own
[1:28:16] idea now my pastor said that a man was a
[1:28:18] spiritualist well that settles it with
[1:28:20] you oh you say i don't believe that now
[1:28:22] brother branham notice i don't believe
[1:28:24] that
[1:28:25] how many people say i don't know i i
[1:28:27] don't believe that no
[1:28:28] no that's not me but way down in that
[1:28:31] subconscious
[1:28:34] it's still there
[1:28:36] you usually move by your subconscious
[1:28:39] just like a big ship going on the sea
[1:28:40] the captain gives orders to a little man
[1:28:42] that goes down in the bowels of the ship
[1:28:44] oh you don't see nothing he just
[1:28:46] operates the way orders come from above
[1:28:47] he don't know he says steer this way
[1:28:49] turn this way full speed of head or back
[1:28:52] up
[1:28:52] he just works according to what the man
[1:28:55] does up here well usually that's the way
[1:28:59] your subconscious works
[1:29:01] it stirs you when you're up here when
[1:29:03] you're trying to think this
[1:29:06] you're trying to believe the word of god
[1:29:08] but way down in here there's something
[1:29:10] else moves you
[1:29:13] now i know that i've caught the patients
[1:29:14] by the thousands on the platform or they
[1:29:16] say brother branham i believe that with
[1:29:18] all my heart
[1:29:20] yes brother branham i believe that
[1:29:23] it's one thing to say it with your mouth
[1:29:28] it's another thing for you to say lord
[1:29:30] deliver me of all doubt
[1:29:33] and clean me of all doubt
[1:29:36] so that i can believe it here
[1:29:41] how many believe the lord can do that
[1:29:45] i've dealt with them thousands in the
[1:29:47] prayer line brother branham i believe
[1:29:48] that and yet down in there i think god
[1:29:50] if they believed it down here
[1:29:53] like they did up here
[1:29:55] it'd be different
[1:29:56] but they believe it up here
[1:29:59] but don't down here
[1:30:01] so that won't work
[1:30:04] this
[1:30:05] here
[1:30:06] will overrule that subconscious will
[1:30:09] move on can you say amen this morning
[1:30:12] notice brother brandon begins to deal
[1:30:13] with hell that you're born even even as
[1:30:15] a even as a boy now we're going to take
[1:30:17] this just for a moment
[1:30:19] prophet of god spends time and you go
[1:30:21] back to the message leadership
[1:30:23] and he starts to talk about how that you
[1:30:24] were led from a little he says when
[1:30:26] you're born you come into the world
[1:30:28] and he says and you're born into the
[1:30:30] earth he says you're led by a mother
[1:30:34] the first
[1:30:36] experience
[1:30:37] that a child has with the love of god
[1:30:41] is through a mother imagine that
[1:30:45] and he says the first love the first
[1:30:47] time that baby feels the love of god
[1:30:50] his nursing there with his mother when
[1:30:52] he's nurtured and he's taken care of
[1:30:55] he's born into this world with a hole in
[1:30:57] his heart
[1:30:58] he's born with a void
[1:31:00] and he says but that mother fills that
[1:31:04] void with the love of god
[1:31:06] fills that void with the things of god
[1:31:09] and he says then you move from that
[1:31:10] mother and you graduate maybe almost
[1:31:13] like dispensationally you move from a
[1:31:15] mother to a father
[1:31:18] and now listen what brother branham says
[1:31:19] here so of man he was made to want to be
[1:31:23] comforted that's so important we could
[1:31:24] preach a message on this he cares do you
[1:31:27] care he cares for you phoenix
[1:31:29] he was made man was made to want to be
[1:31:32] comforted
[1:31:34] so then if he doesn't accept god's way
[1:31:38] then he'll take away for himself
[1:31:41] and he'll try to substitute something to
[1:31:43] take the place of that holy spirit
[1:31:47] oh i want you to listen to it a man or a
[1:31:50] woman that will not accept i wish i
[1:31:53] could
[1:31:54] put this in neon
[1:31:56] wish i could put this in neon flashing
[1:31:58] lights listen to what brother adams is
[1:32:00] so powerful
[1:32:01] a man or a woman that will not accept
[1:32:03] the holy spirit the comforter will try
[1:32:07] to comfort themselves
[1:32:09] with some violent substitute
[1:32:15] man or a woman that will not receive the
[1:32:18] comfort of the holy spirit i want you to
[1:32:20] listen to me young people
[1:32:23] a man was made to want to be
[1:32:26] comforted brother branham tells the
[1:32:28] story of a man and this is
[1:32:30] this is i wish i had it here because
[1:32:31] it's almost too much to to just
[1:32:34] reference you need the quotes one of
[1:32:35] those quotes you really need to say show
[1:32:37] me the quote for that one by the man
[1:32:39] brother and reference is a pastor a
[1:32:41] minister
[1:32:42] and he talks about the man getting up
[1:32:44] behind the pulpit
[1:32:46] drunk
[1:32:49] and he's and he and he says he's
[1:32:50] intoxicated and he's come he says he's
[1:32:53] been named amongst us even in our church
[1:32:54] a man got up before the pulpit and he
[1:32:57] gets up before his church and he's he's
[1:32:59] he's
[1:33:00] buzzed from alcohol that's what brother
[1:33:02] madam says he's intoxicated and he
[1:33:04] preaches
[1:33:06] now what would you do had brother aaron
[1:33:08] came up here after i walked through the
[1:33:10] office door and said we found some
[1:33:11] liquor in the back there and brother
[1:33:12] matt actually came out here what would
[1:33:14] you do
[1:33:15] what would your reaction be if you knew
[1:33:17] the preacher was
[1:33:19] drinking
[1:33:20] incredible to think about
[1:33:22] brother branham says now
[1:33:25] we've criticized that man
[1:33:28] when we ought not to
[1:33:32] whoa
[1:33:34] give me some clarification here brother
[1:33:35] branham
[1:33:37] we've criticized that man
[1:33:39] when we ought not to
[1:33:41] we ought to go and find out
[1:33:44] what's missing inside of there to cause
[1:33:47] him to do that
[1:33:49] we spend so much time
[1:33:52] fighting attributes of sin
[1:33:54] we never get to the calls
[1:33:58] and he says we should have asked what
[1:34:01] happened what's happening in his life
[1:34:04] what emptiness is there that's causing a
[1:34:06] man like that to do that
[1:34:11] and you know when you get a wayward
[1:34:12] child you get a wayward situation child
[1:34:15] teenage or you get a wayward marriage or
[1:34:18] waiver at home or you just hear today
[1:34:19] feel wayward
[1:34:22] so many times the devil would love you
[1:34:24] just to chase
[1:34:25] all the symptoms
[1:34:26] but never get to the root calls
[1:34:30] of the problem
[1:34:32] and brother adam says if a man doesn't
[1:34:35] accept the comforter of the holy spirit
[1:34:39] he'll accept he'll take he said listen
[1:34:41] what he says he'll try to comfort
[1:34:43] himself that's what brother branham says
[1:34:45] in that message he says that man's
[1:34:47] trying to draw comfort
[1:34:48] from other some of the things then he
[1:34:50] goes in that same
[1:34:52] message brother brown says our sister's
[1:34:54] here that wears makeup cuts their hair
[1:34:56] and he says many times we've criticized
[1:34:58] them and we've looked down on them and
[1:35:00] he says we ought to we ought to question
[1:35:02] and wonder what's causing that they're
[1:35:04] trying to find comfort some other way
[1:35:08] they've never received the true
[1:35:10] comforter friends religion will not give
[1:35:13] you this
[1:35:14] doctrine indoctrination will not fill
[1:35:17] this void
[1:35:20] teachings good praise god we've got it
[1:35:23] but you don't need the quotes and the
[1:35:25] doctrines and the books and the tapes
[1:35:26] that we need we need all those but we
[1:35:29] need the person
[1:35:31] of the message
[1:35:33] to come and feel the void
[1:35:35] and then when that person comes in
[1:35:36] there's a life that says i want to live
[1:35:39] like that i desire to live a life that's
[1:35:42] pleasing to the lord
[1:35:44] less conformity culture of conformity
[1:35:47] and more transformity
[1:35:49] true transforming power when god
[1:35:52] transforms a life it is no more pressure
[1:35:55] to do something it's no more a pressure
[1:35:57] to come to church or to serve god it's
[1:35:59] no more fear that you're doing it but
[1:36:01] it's a relationship you have with the
[1:36:03] lord
[1:36:05] and he says with some violent substitute
[1:36:07] the same will present to them satan's
[1:36:09] just got plenty of substitutes an old
[1:36:11] buddy does he ever have substitutes
[1:36:14] today
[1:36:16] but why do we have to have a substitute
[1:36:17] when the pentecostal sky
[1:36:19] uh i didn't have it here before you
[1:36:21] apologize
[1:36:23] and he says why do we have to
[1:36:25] why do we have to have a substitute
[1:36:27] let's read it again there man made to be
[1:36:29] comforted with some violent substitute
[1:36:31] the same will presented them satan's
[1:36:32] just got plenty of substitutes why do we
[1:36:34] have to have a substitute when the
[1:36:36] pentecostal skies are full of the real
[1:36:38] why would i eat from a garbage can when
[1:36:40] a clean table sitting full of choicey
[1:36:42] food there would be something mentally
[1:36:44] wrong with me if i did that now what a
[1:36:46] pity it is to see that man will try to
[1:36:48] substitute something to take that place
[1:36:52] sometimes he'll try to ease his
[1:36:54] conscience by going out
[1:36:56] this is why children go wayward
[1:37:00] they're trying to satisfy a thirst
[1:37:03] they're trying to be comforted listen
[1:37:06] what was the matter
[1:37:07] this is this is uh i'm just going to
[1:37:09] skip that one let's go down here notice
[1:37:11] what brother madam says here
[1:37:13] what time we got we got 11 26 just give
[1:37:16] me 15
[1:37:17] more minutes
[1:37:18] is that all right now what does he says
[1:37:21] now what does a mother now listen to
[1:37:23] what brother brandon begins to talk here
[1:37:25] because he says when you move in
[1:37:26] leadership he says you move from that
[1:37:28] mother and he says that first experience
[1:37:31] with the love of god that boy that baby
[1:37:33] has when he's born when he's born i want
[1:37:36] you to catch this when he's born into
[1:37:38] the world he has a desire he has a
[1:37:41] necessity
[1:37:42] down inside of him that god put there
[1:37:45] to made to be comforted
[1:37:50] and though you're a baby or you're 10 or
[1:37:52] you're 20 or you're 30 or you're 80 that
[1:37:54] need
[1:37:55] never goes away
[1:37:59] never changes
[1:38:00] inside of all of you today is the same
[1:38:03] need you had when you were a baby to be
[1:38:05] comforted you still have it today
[1:38:08] and if you're not accepting the comfort
[1:38:10] of the holy spirit you'll accept some
[1:38:13] violent substitute to fill it
[1:38:18] now notice what he says he says then
[1:38:20] that baby you move from that mother
[1:38:24] and you move to that father
[1:38:26] and he says now it's a little different
[1:38:28] kind of love and he says but it's still
[1:38:30] the love of god maybe a little bit more
[1:38:32] corrective brother branham says more
[1:38:34] disciplinary like brother diggs preaches
[1:38:37] in every home there's law and grace
[1:38:41] mother and father right one of them is
[1:38:44] law one of them's grace
[1:38:47] and your your children will find out
[1:38:48] which one of you is law then they'll go
[1:38:50] to grace and say mommy can i do this
[1:38:53] brother diggs mom was a security officer
[1:38:55] he said she came home every day packing
[1:38:57] a gun so she was the law literally
[1:39:01] and he says you go to that from that
[1:39:02] mother's love to a father's love and
[1:39:04] he's teaching you he's training you he's
[1:39:07] passing down traits
[1:39:09] honor and
[1:39:10] character and integrity and honesty and
[1:39:13] and and and he's given you his teaching
[1:39:16] brother adam says then you move from
[1:39:17] that father and maybe you graduate from
[1:39:19] there to a he says maybe a teacher
[1:39:21] sunday school teacher and he's teaching
[1:39:23] you he's instilling things in you
[1:39:25] and he says then you move from there
[1:39:26] maybe to an employer maybe a boss you go
[1:39:29] from there into your career and you're
[1:39:30] always that's why it's so important let
[1:39:32] me just say this brother adam takes a
[1:39:33] moment to show that from the mother
[1:39:35] teaching to the father teaching to the
[1:39:37] pastor teaching the sunday school
[1:39:39] teacher to the career to the employer to
[1:39:41] the school teacher it is so important
[1:39:43] what teachers you have in your life
[1:39:48] that's why we don't just become
[1:39:50] impressionable to anybody
[1:39:55] that's why we be careful about who what
[1:39:57] influences we subject our children to or
[1:39:59] ourselves to
[1:40:02] hello
[1:40:05] it's important brother branham says then
[1:40:07] you move from teacher to teacher to
[1:40:08] teacher and the first love that that
[1:40:10] baby feels i love that so much is the
[1:40:13] first love of christ listen to me
[1:40:15] mothers and fathers i just want to stop
[1:40:17] and say you we have the ability to
[1:40:20] transmit the love of god through us to
[1:40:24] our children
[1:40:26] or we have the ability to transmit our
[1:40:29] complexes our bitternesses our
[1:40:32] weaknesses we have the ability to to
[1:40:34] transmit those kind of things i just
[1:40:36] want to say lord clean me so much to
[1:40:39] where i transmit the nature and the love
[1:40:42] of christ to all of those around me how
[1:40:44] many want that here today and say lord
[1:40:46] let me transmit the true character of
[1:40:49] christ
[1:40:51] and not myself not my complex
[1:40:54] not my temper not my personality unless
[1:40:57] my personalities the personality of
[1:41:00] jesus
[1:41:02] now what does a mother with a little
[1:41:03] baby when he's sick and fretting she
[1:41:05] picks up the little fella she holds him
[1:41:06] to her breast and she nurses the the
[1:41:09] mother strengthened to his own body
[1:41:10] through the breast not only is he
[1:41:11] satisfied or he's quietened he's
[1:41:13] screaming to the top of his voice he's
[1:41:14] all disturbed
[1:41:16] but when the mother picks him up and
[1:41:18] puts her he says when the mother picks
[1:41:20] him up and puts her on her breast he
[1:41:22] begins to haul she begins to hum to him
[1:41:24] and rock him back and forth
[1:41:27] he feels his mother
[1:41:29] his head is on her bosom and he begins
[1:41:32] to nurse and draw the strength from his
[1:41:34] mother into his body he's rejuvenating
[1:41:37] himself building up strength and also
[1:41:41] satisfied while day by day he's growing
[1:41:44] stronger and stronger just as a baby
[1:41:47] nurses and gets strength you are to
[1:41:50] nurse from jehovah that same need to be
[1:41:53] comforted god can fill that need for you
[1:41:55] this morning you're to nurse from
[1:41:57] jehovah and say lord i want you to feel
[1:42:00] for every part of my being my body my
[1:42:02] soul my spirit let me receive strength
[1:42:05] from you this morning lord
[1:42:08] and let me draw from that and not a
[1:42:11] substitute you can't do that until you
[1:42:12] have love perfect love cast out all fear
[1:42:14] if i want to contribute anything to my
[1:42:16] success in the ministry amongst people
[1:42:17] if there's one thing is because that i
[1:42:20] have loved people
[1:42:23] and people knows that
[1:42:27] when you love someone they know that
[1:42:31] when you care for someone they
[1:42:34] feel that
[1:42:37] you take a little baby three months old
[1:42:38] he don't know nothing he's got a mind
[1:42:39] but it isn't developed you don't know
[1:42:41] who or nothing the doctors say they can
[1:42:43] see a light might see your hand but they
[1:42:45] can only follow it and he will just be
[1:42:47] kicking his little heels and screaming
[1:42:49] to the top of his voice well here comes
[1:42:51] some kind woman comes along past and
[1:42:53] he'll say well well dear he just kicks
[1:42:55] right on
[1:42:57] he don't know who the woman is he don't
[1:42:59] know nobody listen i want you just to
[1:43:01] don't think here for a moment i'm just
[1:43:02] showing you a powerful principle that
[1:43:05] from the time you're a little baby you
[1:43:07] don't change you get older you mature
[1:43:09] you get married you have children of
[1:43:10] yourself but there's a necessity there's
[1:43:12] a comforter that you always need
[1:43:18] are you here this morning
[1:43:20] there's a part of you the real you that
[1:43:22] needs to feed upon that
[1:43:25] that needs to nurse from that that needs
[1:43:27] to draw strength from that receiving the
[1:43:29] holy ghost is wonderful but the
[1:43:31] experience with god is not a one-time
[1:43:34] experience it's a daily experience with
[1:43:37] the lord
[1:43:38] it's a daily as paul said dying it's a
[1:43:41] daily death to self and a daily
[1:43:44] resurrection of the word inside of my
[1:43:46] life
[1:43:49] kicking to the top here comes a little
[1:43:51] woman he don't know her
[1:43:53] he don't know who the woman is he don't
[1:43:54] know nobody
[1:43:55] but let that mother walk up
[1:43:58] just put her hands on him that settles
[1:44:01] it
[1:44:02] now he don't know his mother
[1:44:06] listen
[1:44:06] now he don't know his mother but his
[1:44:09] little spirit
[1:44:10] knows there's something about that
[1:44:13] spirit
[1:44:14] that nothing else can inject that
[1:44:17] mother's love
[1:44:19] to him
[1:44:20] you might seek for all of the answers to
[1:44:22] your problem
[1:44:24] in the world
[1:44:25] and i'm so thankful for the voices of
[1:44:28] good godly
[1:44:30] men who i could counsel with and ask i'm
[1:44:32] thankful for good godly friends who i
[1:44:35] can speak to and and get advice from and
[1:44:38] say pray for me i love all of that i'm
[1:44:40] thankful for that but friends there's
[1:44:42] nothing like the voice of the lord
[1:44:46] when it's his voice that speaks
[1:44:48] that settles it for me
[1:44:52] oh how we need that voice to speak
[1:44:56] no matter how much the other person
[1:44:57] loves it ain't the mother's love is that
[1:44:58] right she lays their hands on him he'll
[1:45:00] dry up see he's ready because that
[1:45:02] mother there's a love about her that
[1:45:03] goes to that baby
[1:45:05] that the baby's little spirit recognizes
[1:45:08] that's a love that no other love is
[1:45:12] mother is so great you know the first
[1:45:14] one that receives you in life this life
[1:45:16] is your mother
[1:45:18] no one can touch you because you're
[1:45:20] conceived and she bares you under her
[1:45:21] heart she's the first to know you the
[1:45:24] first two in this life to hold you then
[1:45:26] when you're born she's the one on the
[1:45:28] first hand that touch you and wipes back
[1:45:30] the tears of you out of your eyes she's
[1:45:32] the first one to pat you and to love you
[1:45:34] and to coo over you and this life is
[1:45:36] your mother now i think that there's not
[1:45:39] enough honor that we could give to a
[1:45:41] mother
[1:45:42] mother is the first with the child and
[1:45:45] she's a great responsibility
[1:45:47] of what that child will be will be based
[1:45:50] upon the way that mother starts that
[1:45:52] child on the path that it must travel
[1:45:55] mother has the responsibility from god
[1:45:58] to place that child on the right road
[1:46:00] and i think that's why mothers has
[1:46:03] a special little touch
[1:46:07] thankful for godly mothers
[1:46:09] of a boy in the city i think his
[1:46:11] mother's present now he's almost my age
[1:46:12] i don't say this to hurt the mother
[1:46:14] because she has enough hurts as all
[1:46:16] mothers what a statement
[1:46:19] because no one will hurt you
[1:46:21] deeper than your own children
[1:46:24] she has enough mothers listen to this
[1:46:26] but the boy drinks he drinks heavy gets
[1:46:29] real drunk he'll come home and jump in
[1:46:30] the bed with his mother put his arms
[1:46:31] around her he's got grandchildren but
[1:46:34] there's something about just the pad of
[1:46:37] a mother that seems to take a different
[1:46:39] place than anything else can touch that
[1:46:42] is in this life humanly speaking you
[1:46:44] know a man like moses if i could give
[1:46:46] credit anything to his character it was
[1:46:48] because he had a god-sent
[1:46:51] mother
[1:46:54] i'm saying all this for a reason to
[1:46:56] stick with me here
[1:46:58] the comfort that you receive
[1:47:00] brother adam says or he'll fill up he'll
[1:47:02] fill that void with a violent substitute
[1:47:04] listen to influence tell you i think
[1:47:06] today we have such juvenile crime wave
[1:47:08] across the nation but i think i really
[1:47:10] think it started in the home
[1:47:12] i think that parents begin to let go and
[1:47:14] if the child had been raised up in a
[1:47:16] good old-fashioned godly home
[1:47:18] i don't say it would be all over
[1:47:20] certainly not
[1:47:22] that means no matter how good your home
[1:47:24] is no matter how good you raise them
[1:47:26] that doesn't mean they're going to turn
[1:47:28] out perfect
[1:47:29] hello is this tucson tabernacle still
[1:47:32] awake today we need to preach to the
[1:47:33] streaming audience
[1:47:36] that doesn't mean that when you do
[1:47:38] everything right you may do everything
[1:47:40] right and still get a a bad situation
[1:47:45] right
[1:47:46] you may do everything right brother
[1:47:49] madam says i don't say that he says i
[1:47:51] don't say it be all over certainly not
[1:47:53] go if it had been raised in the good old
[1:47:54] godly home i don't say it'd be all over
[1:47:56] certainly not but it certainly give that
[1:47:58] child the right kind of influence
[1:48:02] i think many times you say brother matt
[1:48:04] then what does it mean it means that
[1:48:05] your children
[1:48:07] just remember this there's a part of
[1:48:09] them that's the real theme and then
[1:48:12] there's a part of them that's the
[1:48:14] struggling part with the things of the
[1:48:16] carnal nature and the carnal word don't
[1:48:18] ever let the devil get your eyes so
[1:48:20] fixed on the on that situation that you
[1:48:24] miss the true seed gene down inside of
[1:48:27] the heart
[1:48:28] and when you pray and you have faith you
[1:48:30] pray to that seed that god placed in
[1:48:32] them before the foundation of the world
[1:48:35] i don't say it would be all over i think
[1:48:37] many times homes the children have been
[1:48:38] brought up wrong turn loose on the
[1:48:40] street just live for themselves while
[1:48:42] the mother stays in a bar room the
[1:48:43] father and so forth they don't take care
[1:48:44] of this child another thing they don't
[1:48:46] love it
[1:48:47] and give it the affections to take it up
[1:48:51] it's young
[1:48:52] you've got to teach it
[1:48:54] to love
[1:48:55] and respect
[1:48:58] and to read the bible
[1:49:04] the lady was born god had a provided way
[1:49:06] i love this
[1:49:08] the lady was born
[1:49:09] in that nervous condition her mother and
[1:49:11] father died when she was a baby child
[1:49:13] baby raised up just tossed about
[1:49:15] everywhere never had the proper love and
[1:49:17] care the baby has you know mother i want
[1:49:19] to tell you something i know i got a
[1:49:20] little boy back there and he's really
[1:49:22] rankly spoiled
[1:49:26] but i would rather have him that way
[1:49:29] listen
[1:49:30] i would rather have him that way i
[1:49:32] believe it'll make a better man out of
[1:49:34] him if god lets him live than to let him
[1:49:37] scream and cry and upset his little self
[1:49:39] listen a few years ago some normal
[1:49:41] modern witch doctor said that let the
[1:49:43] baby cry don't pick it up that'll all
[1:49:45] things like that don't let grandma touch
[1:49:46] it you know what they hatched out you
[1:49:49] see what it is a juvenile delinquency a
[1:49:52] bunch of neurotics god made a baby to be
[1:49:57] loved
[1:49:58] that's why he made a mother to love a
[1:50:01] baby that's why we're supposed to be
[1:50:03] this way god made it that way and
[1:50:06] anytime you upset god's program you must
[1:50:08] remember you're wrong and you will be
[1:50:10] wrong as long as you're upsetting god's
[1:50:12] program follow god's program do it the
[1:50:16] way god said
[1:50:18] do it
[1:50:20] he goes to job had a bunch of daughters
[1:50:22] and sons when they knew they were out
[1:50:23] like birds people raised up children
[1:50:25] today i feel sorry for fathers and
[1:50:26] mothers today being a parent myself no
[1:50:28] in one reason i'm trying to get my
[1:50:29] children away from our city we don't
[1:50:31] have any christian schools there and i
[1:50:33] want to get them somewhere they'll be
[1:50:35] brought up in school in a real
[1:50:36] fundamental school where they learn to
[1:50:38] love the lord
[1:50:42] so what is the prophet saying you are
[1:50:44] teaching your children something
[1:50:47] whether you are teaching them or not
[1:50:50] you're teaching them whether you're
[1:50:53] actively teaching them how to love the
[1:50:55] lord teaching them how to worship the
[1:50:57] lord teaching them how to praise the
[1:51:00] lord you say well i'm just not going to
[1:51:01] teach them you're teaching them whether
[1:51:03] you want to or not
[1:51:06] and he says i'm teeth the teaching that
[1:51:08] i can give them to he says
[1:51:10] to love the lord the teaching that i can
[1:51:11] give them around home yet they get out
[1:51:13] there in that worldly crowd the devil is
[1:51:16] a shrewd felon he pushes that into them
[1:51:18] if you keep them under the hall under
[1:51:20] the spirit until they get old enough to
[1:51:22] receive the holy ghost and know what
[1:51:24] it's all about then god will take care
[1:51:25] of the rest of it i say lord help us to
[1:51:29] keep our homes under the spirit how many
[1:51:31] parents how many mothers how many
[1:51:33] fathers how many i don't care who you
[1:51:35] are today whether you have children or
[1:51:36] don't have children you could raise a
[1:51:38] hand and say lord let my home be a home
[1:51:41] where the spirit of the lord dwells
[1:51:44] where he's comfortable where he's where
[1:51:46] he's worshipped
[1:51:50] and he says until they get along the
[1:51:51] lord he says the lord god will take care
[1:51:53] of the rest of it but first they've got
[1:51:55] to get a little adolescent days now
[1:51:56] every person thinks of their children
[1:51:58] while they're under your wings you can
[1:51:59] watch them but once out from under the
[1:52:00] wings then the devil's got every little
[1:52:02] oscar he can out there to associate with
[1:52:05] your children that's infidelic and mean
[1:52:06] and devilish and everything else god
[1:52:09] help us god
[1:52:11] help us
[1:52:13] i'm just going to read just got a few
[1:52:15] more this the holy spirit
[1:52:17] gave this to me before coming out and i
[1:52:19] just i'm going to
[1:52:20] obey him this morning
[1:52:22] what brought out juvenile delinquency
[1:52:24] was parent delinquency
[1:52:26] was parent delinquency the parent
[1:52:28] failing to take care of the children you
[1:52:29] remember a few years ago when my boy was
[1:52:31] born that he's been about i think about
[1:52:33] 19 now i remember the doctor told my
[1:52:35] wife said just let that kid squall said
[1:52:37] it ain't going to hurt him and if
[1:52:38] grandma comes along to pick him up take
[1:52:40] her keep her hands off of him said he
[1:52:41] ought to be in the he ought to be crib
[1:52:43] broke at six months old now you know
[1:52:45] better than that
[1:52:49] sounds like a talking of a witch doctor
[1:52:50] instead of a real doctor
[1:52:52] you know what it hatched out i hatched
[1:52:54] out a bunch of neurotics and a bunch of
[1:52:55] gangsters
[1:52:57] listen
[1:52:58] god gave you that baby
[1:53:02] to love
[1:53:05] i don't care how bad you spoil it love
[1:53:08] it
[1:53:09] anyhow
[1:53:11] i hope so i hope you're catching
[1:53:14] it's not just about mothers loving a
[1:53:16] baby
[1:53:17] that void is always there we are to be
[1:53:19] people
[1:53:20] if there was anybody in the world
[1:53:23] who could transmit the love of god
[1:53:26] to everyone around us it should be
[1:53:28] believers
[1:53:31] i said this back home and i'll just
[1:53:33] repeat it
[1:53:34] it is not an attribute
[1:53:37] of a christian to be rude
[1:53:43] i may have to get sneaked behind this
[1:53:45] pulpit and say that again
[1:53:48] it is not the attribute of a christian
[1:53:50] to be rude
[1:53:53] in fact the opposite it is the attribute
[1:53:55] of a real believer to be kind
[1:54:00] the bible says that be kindly
[1:54:03] affectionate one to another
[1:54:07] you know those be kind bars they're
[1:54:09] biblical
[1:54:11] come on laugh it's okay to laugh
[1:54:14] be kind to bars you should eat more of
[1:54:16] them be kind
[1:54:18] be kind
[1:54:20] kindness has left the world but it
[1:54:21] shouldn't leave the body of christ
[1:54:25] we should be trans you're transmitting
[1:54:27] something you're either transmitting
[1:54:29] your complexes you're transmitting your
[1:54:32] tempers you're transmitting your your
[1:54:35] pet peeves you're transmitting your
[1:54:37] irritations your idiosyncrasies you're
[1:54:39] transmitting and you're giving that out
[1:54:42] or you're saying lord clean me of all of
[1:54:44] that i don't want to transmit and
[1:54:45] project that and let me pray transmit
[1:54:48] and project the love of christ and the
[1:54:50] nature of christ and the joy of christ
[1:54:52] how many can say that let it project out
[1:54:54] from me
[1:54:56] clean out my channels so that the real
[1:54:58] me
[1:54:59] is what people see
[1:55:01] let my family see it before anybody else
[1:55:04] sees it
[1:55:06] have kindness in the home
[1:55:08] before we have kindness out in public
[1:55:11] let the love of god dwell in our houses
[1:55:14] and our relationships how many want that
[1:55:16] i do
[1:55:18] he says god gave you that baby to love i
[1:55:21] want you to catch this god to love i
[1:55:22] don't care how bad you spoil it uh love
[1:55:26] it anyhow
[1:55:28] that's right love it if you don't love
[1:55:29] it now it'll grow up in a cold home and
[1:55:32] indifferent it'll seek love somewhere or
[1:55:34] something
[1:55:35] it'll make an out light listen it'll
[1:55:37] make an outline for somewhere
[1:55:39] mother take that baby and give it
[1:55:42] fellowship and love now
[1:55:44] make it a part of you which it is and
[1:55:48] act like it and hug it and kiss it and
[1:55:51] love it
[1:55:53] don't be too cold with the things of the
[1:55:54] world god gave you that as a treasure
[1:55:57] raise it right
[1:55:58] amen notice what's the matter we got
[1:56:01] away from the things of god you get away
[1:56:03] from nature
[1:56:04] and then you're out of the will of god
[1:56:06] now i want you to notice job thinking of
[1:56:08] his children he said prayer adventure
[1:56:09] the god they might sin so he offered the
[1:56:11] only preparation that he knowed it was a
[1:56:12] burnt off sacrifice set in the blood and
[1:56:14] he shed the blood of a lamb for his
[1:56:16] children making preparation if they did
[1:56:18] sin you see it job was mindful of his
[1:56:20] children to make a preparation for their
[1:56:22] sin and mother and father if we would
[1:56:24] quit spending money on our children
[1:56:26] learning tap dancing and things like
[1:56:28] that and some kind of how to be an actor
[1:56:30] and put more time of pleading the blood
[1:56:33] of jesus over them and showing them love
[1:56:35] and fellowship we'd get along better the
[1:56:37] child would too
[1:56:41] i just went through the experience with
[1:56:42] my rebecca see
[1:56:45] just committed to god
[1:56:47] when she got to be a little teeny and
[1:56:49] she was going with some girl when we
[1:56:51] first went out there going run over to
[1:56:54] some girl's house taking music lessons
[1:56:56] this girl i'll come by one day and hear
[1:56:58] this girl was sitting there at the piano
[1:57:00] playing rock and roll well that was just
[1:57:02] enough for me
[1:57:05] so i told her stay away from over there
[1:57:07] see
[1:57:14] i've seen it one time
[1:57:15] that was enough and i told her stay away
[1:57:19] then she said well it's the only place i
[1:57:22] got to take music you know what teenies
[1:57:24] get i said every kid has to go through
[1:57:26] that practically everyone goes through
[1:57:29] that age
[1:57:30] you did
[1:57:32] i did
[1:57:34] and i love this
[1:57:35] and we've got to think their
[1:57:38] thoughts
[1:57:41] i love that statement i read someone
[1:57:42] posted and i just have saved it
[1:57:45] be to your children be who you needed
[1:57:49] when you were their age
[1:57:51] we've got to think their thoughts so
[1:57:53] then a few days after the mother after
[1:57:55] her listen so then a few days after that
[1:57:57] her mother got after her for something
[1:57:59] and she sashed her
[1:58:01] now that's not rebecca at all
[1:58:03] took off and slammed the door almost
[1:58:05] knocked the things off the wall went to
[1:58:06] school
[1:58:07] now i ought to have seemingly just taken
[1:58:10] my belt off and followed her out in the
[1:58:11] yard and brought her back with warps
[1:58:13] around her see
[1:58:16] but i thought wait a minute
[1:58:18] i got to thank 18 year old thoughts see
[1:58:23] you see how important it is to always be
[1:58:25] controlled by the holy spirit
[1:58:27] hello
[1:58:28] sale important is to always in your
[1:58:30] reactions that are not your actions that
[1:58:32] get you in trouble it's your reactions
[1:58:35] it's always important to think and be
[1:58:37] controlled and tempered be moderated by
[1:58:40] the holy spirit brother adam says hold
[1:58:41] on
[1:58:42] hold on i should have grabbed a belt
[1:58:44] but hold on i gotta think 18 year old

[1:58:52] i can do
[1:58:53] now if it's out of our hands
[1:58:55] we have to take the next step
[1:58:58] i said well look honey now you've got to
[1:59:01] listen to me it's hard for you to do
[1:59:03] this i'm your husband
[1:59:05] but people drive across the nation and
[1:59:07] around just for a few words of advice
[1:59:10] now i talked to her the other day and
[1:59:13] she just walked away from me now becky
[1:59:16] never did do that to me see
[1:59:19] and when her mother said something about
[1:59:21] it she slammed the door
[1:59:24] and say you expect me to sit here and be
[1:59:26] a wallflower all my life
[1:59:29] and blammy she slammed the door and went
[1:59:31] out
[1:59:33] that was
[1:59:37] i didn't hear you
[1:59:39] let's read it again
[1:59:41] she went out
[1:59:42] blaming she slammed the door and that
[1:59:44] was
[1:59:46] you mean it wasn't her wasn't the real
[1:59:48] her
[1:59:51] you mean there's a part of you that you
[1:59:53] could manifest that's not the real you
[1:59:58] that was the devil
[2:00:00] i remember the first two years of her
[2:00:01] life she cried
[2:00:03] we'd go into a restaurant to eat i'd
[2:00:05] walk her on the street while mita ate
[2:00:08] and then she'd walk her a while and i

[2:00:14] i couldn't rest and everything me
[2:00:16] standing there now and something said to
[2:00:18] me

[2:00:24] hand me that baby i said satan in the
[2:00:27] name of jesus christ you take your hands
[2:00:30] off of her she stopped right then and
[2:00:33] never cried no more she's the quietest

[2:00:58] spat between a prophet and his wife
[2:01:03] said that's my kid i said isn't it mine
[2:01:04] too
[2:01:05] all right i said if she was dying this
[2:01:08] morning
[2:01:10] you'd have to commit her to god for her
[2:01:12] eternal destination
[2:01:14] why can't we commit her to god now
[2:01:17] for her earthly journey
[2:01:20] she said well that's my kid

[2:01:48] were her parents these kids today need a
[2:01:52] buddy if they had a mother and father

[2:05:09] i said honey that sounds kind of crude
[2:05:11] but people come everywhere said on
[2:05:13] personal interviews and things i said
[2:05:15] i'm so common we're common one to
[2:05:17] another because we're husband and wife
[2:05:19] but we never let that happen you must
[2:05:22] remember
[2:05:24] this is the name of the in the name of
[2:05:26] the lord
[2:05:32] what was his desire musicians could you
[2:05:34] come
[2:05:36] what was his desire
[2:05:38] could you bow your heads with me
[2:05:40] here this morning
[2:05:43] service took a turn i didn't think it
[2:05:45] would take that's all right we just
[2:05:47] let the holy spirit do what he wants to
[2:05:49] do this morning
[2:05:54] let her know that you love her
[2:05:57] she's going to get somebody to love her
[2:06:01] might be the wrong one
[2:06:15] we're transmitters
[2:06:19] transmitters
[2:06:20] we project
[2:06:23] and that projection that we project is
[2:06:27] to our friends to our church
[2:06:29] to our family to our home
[2:06:32] and what you project what you allow
[2:06:36] say brother mad am i not born of the
[2:06:38] spirit no i'm not taking that away from
[2:06:39] you
[2:06:41] but if you're not careful
[2:06:43] the real you is not projected
[2:06:46] and instead maybe those fears and that
[2:06:48] complexes and those bad experiences and
[2:06:51] those things that you were taught that
[2:06:52] you were that were wrong those things
[2:06:54] you went through that were wrong
[2:06:55] caused you to be bitter maybe angry
[2:06:57] maybe short tempered maybe certain
[2:06:59] things in your in your maybe certain
[2:07:01] complexes that you have
[2:07:04] if you're not careful in your home you
[2:07:05] project all of those things
[2:07:09] and what you project
[2:07:11] determines your atmosphere
[2:07:15] and when you project the wrong thing you
[2:07:17] get the wrong atmosphere when you get
[2:07:19] the wrong atmosphere
[2:07:20] you get the wrong spirits when you get
[2:07:22] the wrong spirits
[2:07:24] they develop the wrong habits and they
[2:07:26] develop the wrong things and they think
[2:07:28] the wrong things old friends there's
[2:07:30] anything i could just raise my hand if
[2:07:31] someone would want to raise it with me
[2:07:33] and say lord i want to project you this
[2:07:36] morning i want you to be projected from
[2:07:39] my mind
[2:07:40] from my spirit from my mouth from my

[2:07:55] my memory i want you just to clean it i
[2:07:57] want to have victory over it today i
[2:07:59] want to put it in the past and not allow
[2:08:01] it to project itself when circumstances
[2:08:04] arise and they come up and maybe a
[2:08:06] certain situation arises and i react a
[2:08:08] certain way but i don't want to do that

[2:15:00] you still have an influence
[2:15:02] it's something that will always be there
[2:15:07] when dad got sick all of us rallied
[2:15:09] quickly together
[2:15:12] dad calls me every day
[2:15:14] rodrigo
[2:15:15] is there something i need to pray about
[2:15:18] that never goes away
[2:15:21] let it stay there
[2:15:24] i got a phone call from my insurance
[2:15:27] agent when the girls were getting their
[2:15:29] cars
[2:15:30] or i called them
[2:15:31] [Music]
[2:15:32] and i asked him
[2:15:34] one day are my girls up to date on their
[2:15:36] insurance
[2:15:38] because most of their loans were
[2:15:40] co-signed by me
[2:15:42] or grandpa
[2:15:44] and if something happened we'd be
[2:15:45] responsible
[2:15:47] and the insurance agent he said aaron he
[2:15:51] said if all the kids were like your kids
[2:15:53] we wouldn't have these problems that we
[2:15:55] have
[2:15:56] if they're going to be a day late they
[2:15:58] tell me they come and they pay for it
[2:16:01] made me very happy
[2:16:03] but as i was driving to work i said lord
[2:16:06] but how are they with
[2:16:08] you and them
[2:16:10] more so than the insurance agent
[2:16:13] how is their hearts with you
[2:16:16] are they making things right
[2:16:18] we've taught them our best
[2:16:20] and the lord took me to job some driving
[2:16:22] he says just as job laid a sacrifice
[2:16:25] every morning
[2:16:27] he goes for his children
[2:16:29] i will honor your prayers for them
[2:16:33] and
[2:16:34] made the drive to work a whole lot
[2:16:37] a lot better
[2:16:38] [Music]

[2:16:46] i i was reading doing some studying
[2:16:50] did a word search and took a paragraph
[2:16:52] that brother brown said and i went up
[2:16:54] two or three paragraphs and read that
[2:16:55] just to get the whole meaning
[2:16:58] and brother braham said this now like
[2:17:00] any good father as job did
[2:17:03] he would lay a sacrifice for his
[2:17:05] children any good father would do that
[2:17:08] for their children
[2:17:09] [Music]

[2:17:13] your children

[2:17:17] them up before god and you be an example

[2:19:47] maybe ask why did you do that why was
[2:19:49] that your reaction i would have done it
[2:19:51] differently
