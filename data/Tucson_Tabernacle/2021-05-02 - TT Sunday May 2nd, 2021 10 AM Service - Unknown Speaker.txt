hosanna to the king praise the lord amen isn't it good to be in church today amen thank you musicians thank you sister martha shannon for helping us i know we've got a few of them are out on uh at the meeting so brother sean martin and them are having meetings over in i think it's west virginia someplace like that we were watching streaming some of their meetings there last night you're just having a wonderful time and they were taking pictures of all the young people going through the prayer line and my son was on the front row and amen it was just good to see so many of the believers there but amen god's here today with us do you believe that amen blessed be the name of the lord i just want to make a couple announcements if we could we had announced that we were going to have the communion tonight but just a little bit uh brother anthony had got with me he's a young brother been coming to church a little bit and so he came friday night to the fellowship there where some of us came together and fellowshipped and we just began to talk and he asked me about water baptism and he wanted to be baptized so that's wonderful we went through the scriptures of water baptism and how the bible says he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved you got to believe and be baptized on the day of pentecost they preached the gospel and the bible says three thousand got baptized amen so our brother wants to be baptized and he was going to invite several of his family members and we were just thinking with the communion it might be a little um awkward the way that we would do that to have some wait for the baptism to be over to have communion or wait for the communion to be over to do the baptism so we thought we might move the baptism or the the communion until next sunday if that's okay would that be alright with everybody we just moved to communion to next sunday next sunday's mother's day be a special day to honor our mothers so if it's okay maybe we'll have the water baptism tonight and if there's anybody else who'd like to be baptized the pool is open amen when the was it philip he preached the gospel in acts 8 and he said here's water what does hendrix i think i'm done thank you thank you they're so patient with me and so i was thinking about that when philip got done preaching jesus he said here's water i want to get baptized so we have a pool of water and amen if you want to be baptized today would be a good day we set some chairs out i noticed it's been getting hotter so we just set some chairs out in the foyer area here after the service if you want to sit there and fellowship and and do that that would be a good way to be out of the heat you want to be out in the area there and we've got another building there it's good for games and you all had a birthday party for me a couple weeks ago that was really nice to have it up there god bless you for that and so i just wanted to thank the sunday school teachers that taught this morning god bless you all the ones that give their life to help let's give them a little round of applause god bless them amen it's not easy being a sunday school teacher i'm a sunday school teacher back home my wife is the other sunday school teacher so when we're gone my son william fills in and then my daughter-in-law does the other sunday school class so i know that when i was a young child they taught me sunday school i can go back and tell you verses that they taught classes that they lessons that they taught me that stays with me it's just different sometimes when somebody else says the same thing and it sticks with a child and stays with them so god bless our young people and god bless you parents for coming early and supporting them i drove up and some of the parents were here very early and god bless now the sunday school teachers are clapping doesn't do it amen so let's just try to support remember we read that last week when brother branham said he had he dedicated the church and what house will you build for me he said now we're going to need sunday school teachers now he wasn't going to have to have sunday school teachers if he didn't intend for children to go to sunday school so god bless them amen praise the lord i got a little message on my heart um there and i i don't know i need to talk to the brothers about these red pieces of tape on our pews here those social distancing things i don't know what it is we seem to be doing it up front but the back it doesn't we're not social distancing back there so i say we might as well just move all those people up here talk to him about taking the tape saw tape off our pews i i got to be honest with you this is just really weird for me i mean it's just i'm used to this three rows being full of young people on this side full of young teenage girls and then the parents right behind them they're trying to find pews to get in there and so have you sit all the way in the back it's like man is it my breath but i took a breath in the back back there my deodorant but i think i'm good on that too so uh amen i'd like to see everybody maybe one day the holy spirit will just all be up close i'd like to have us all on the four first four rows and have us all just wrapped around here like jesus talking you know and having his on the boat and he's just all real close to each other and he had to take up a child so there had to be a child close to him right when he had so he had to be kids up close to the minister and he just took a child and set him on you here brother random what tape was i listening to the other day in georgia and you can hear this child screams through the whole tape they're just screaming scream but it didn't matter he just kept preaching on and preaching and so it didn't bother him at all so it won't bother me here's my wife who is right up here on the second row she likes my preaching though she gets it all the time amen no we just are it's good to be together amen love the lord if you have your bibles luke chapter 17 and also john chapter 18 a little thought the kingdom of god is within you i just want to speak on that this morning a little bit contrasting it with the kingdom of the devil there's only two powers in the world the power of god and the power of the devil amen the devil wants to mix that all up amen but there's only two sides there's god's side on the devil side and today we want to be sure we're over on the winning side i read in the back of the book and those that were with jesus when so if you're not with jesus i want to encourage you today to get on jesus side get on the winning side amen luke chapter 17 and let's just pray before we would read the scripture heavenly father lord we just come before you we open your word pray god that you would just bless the scriptures lord and you know that i have spent most of the day yesterday in my room praying and seeking you and late last night up early this morning on my knees praying lord you know the people that will be here father and the the children and the teenagers and the adults and the parents every visitor lord you knew who they would be today and i just pray lord something would be said that is put on my heart lord that would help the people along the way father lord we know we're here just in a few weeks lord and then we'll be going home and just pray during this time together that you would just help us to minister to one another may you strengthen us and help us father we pray and bless the church lord and even brother anthony he had to work this morning lord but i pray you continue to deal with his heart as he's desired to be baptized tonight bless him lord and if there's others that have a desire to be baptized lord you said suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not may you bless the scripture today we ask in jesus name amen praise the lord luke chapter 17 verse number 20 and when he was demanded of the pharisees when the kingdom of god should come he answered them and said the kingdom of god cometh not with observation neither shall they say lo here or lo there for behold the kingdom of god is within you behold the kingdom of god it's down inside of you so you got to remember these were people who were being overrun by the roman government to be like the russians come and taken over america and so we're being overrun by the russians and they're looking for the kingdom of america to be restored but jesus said the kingdom that i'm preaching to you is not a natural kingdom the kingdom is within you amen go to saint john chapter 18. saint john chapter 18 verse 30 30 you know let's just back up a little bit verse 33. saint john chapter 18 verse 33 then pilate entered into the judgment hall again and called jesus and said unto him art thou the king of the jews and jesus answered him sayest thou this of thyself or do others tell it thee of me pilate answered am i a jew thine own nation and the chief priest have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence and pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then jesus answered thou sayest that i am a king to this end was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice amen next verse there pilate saith in him what is truth and when he had said this he went out again unto the jews and saith unto them i find no fault in him amen may god add his blessing to the word you may be seated i just want to take a few minutes here this morning and just speak of the subject the kingdom of god is within you the kingdom of god is within you they asked jesus about this kingdom jesus said my kingdom is not of this world and if you you you look at that the word world there if you study it in the scofield there i think there's a little k it says cosmos there in in saint john chapter 18 verse 36 it said my kingdom is not of this world which is cosmos and you must understand that it's not of this world order we know that god created the heavens and the earth and so he wasn't talking about that world he was talking about the world the cosmos the world order amen and so if you brother mensch preaches a message in the future home it's about a three hour message but he talks about in first peter second peter chapter three verse six he talks about the world that then was the world that is now and the world that is to come and how that the world that was before noah's day god wiped the world off they call it he calls it the world but it was the world order he didn't destroy the world and create a new world but it was the world order so that's what jesus is saying here he said my kingdom is not of this cosmos my kingdom is not of this world order but my kingdom is is within you it's inside of you and as i begin to think about that because most people they get their minds just set they're so narrow-minded they think that the church of god is just their group of people and they don't have a global view of the church of the living god now the church of god the church means the ecclesia it means the called out ones i think we mentioned that on on wednesday it's the called out it's a people that are called out of the world so it's not a building the only reason we have a building is because there's ecclesia people that are called out and pretty soon you start with the small building i think in that message what house will you build for me brother ham said this is one that we moved from here to another one and then it looked like there was another one that he was talking about there but he said because as we grow and we need more but you only need a building because you have people in that building but sometimes people they join a church or they join a building we don't want to do that we want to join the church of the living god we want to talk about that so if you look in the and i mentioned this maybe the other day but i just want to maybe go back through it they say repetition is the best teacher repetition is the best teacher and anybody that's a teacher knows that sometimes you have to say it you have to say it you have to say it again but jesus only mentions or the word church is only mentioned two times in matthew mark luke and john the word church is only used two times in matthew mark luke and john jesus mentioned he said i will build my church in another place he said go tell the church if there's ought between someone to go so that's the only two times it's mentioned in matthew mark luke and john but the word kingdom the kingdom of heaven or the kingdom of god is mentioned 121 times 121 times jesus is talking about a kingdom a kingdom of god he's not just talking to the 12 disciples that are sitting there oh we got a brother that's either coming up to help me or god bless your brother you broke your toe they said the other day how you doing you're doing better praise the lord those toe ones are tough ones because they can't do much for them they just put a boot or a splinter you do the best you can but god is your healer amen he's the only healer he said i'm the lord it heals all of your sicknesses and all of your diseases you might have a tooth and they pull the tooth out to take away the toothache but only god can heal the whole the devil would like to send you some type of an infection it caused you to get a fever and that infection spread through your body and take your take your life but jesus said i am come that you might have life and that you might have it more abundantly the devil might create some type of a tumor or something like that in your body because of gmo or genetically modified foods or all those things might create a tumor and then the doctor goes in and maybe takes that tumor out but only god can heal the incision where the doctor took it how many understand that and then if you listen to a message brother random said life is a healer look that message up and listen to it it's so amazing brother man goes through and talks about that people think medicine is a healer medicine isn't a healer medicine is actually a poison that goes in and kills the bad germs in your body so that the good germs can become more predominant and overcome the bad germs amen he's the lord that heals all of our sicknesses and all of our diseases so i think it's so good for us that we open our mind up and broaden our mind up to see that jesus was bringing a kingdom to the whole world it was a global kingdom it wasn't just those little disciples that he was there in fact after his resurrection the people were there and it was looked like they were just going to stay there so god sends a persecution to jerusalem so that they flee and go to the whole world and start spreading the gospel amen sometimes god brings adversity to us not to destroy us but sometimes it's to cause us to testify of our faith in jesus christ you know after we move past matthew mark luke and john and you if you look in the new testament the who which is written to church churches like paul would say under the church that is galatia to in galatia to the church of the lady oseans to the ladies the church and lady asea the church is mentioned 109 times so now it's not jesus was talking to the kingdom but now he's paul starts writing letters to individual churches so we know the corinthians they had a lot of problems they had fornication in the church they spoke in tongues just openly and so he had to deal with that local church the ephesians he didn't have any problem with those problems those problems in the the ephesian church or the galatian church so we know that there's local bodies of christ but there is a kingdom of god i want to be a part of the kingdom of god there's only one way to get in that kingdom it's by the baptism of the holy spirit i believe it's first corinthians 12 13 it says by one spirit are we baptized into this body of jesus christ and so once persons baptized into that there might be different assemblies people that gather together and we don't ever want to be against other assemblies if god causes someone else to labor in a different field that doesn't mean they're not god's children we just say god bless them and this is the field that god's caused us to labor in and be together so i was thinking that i gave some of the scriptures to the brothers there i don't know if they have them but romans chapter 14 verse 17 the bible says paul is writing to the romans he said for the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost amen the kingdom of god is within you so there should be righteousness within you there should be peace within you there should be joy inside of you amen because that is the kingdom of god in mark chapter 10 verse 14 they were talking to him about the little children this is the verse i referred to jesus said he said suffer the little children to come and to be me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of of god for verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child he shall not enter therein i was listening to the message yesterday studying at the last couple days ye must be born again brother branham said the church makes this complicate complicated he said god makes it simple amen i love simplicity there's something very powerful about simplicity before brother branham preaches the seven seals and the revelation of the seven seals his message was god hidden and revealed in simplicity so a lot of people look for christ hidden in complexity but if he says look it's like this microphone if i hide this microphone right here and i hide it and it's hidden there i say let's find the microphone somebody goes in the balcony somebody goes out there somebody goes out in the yard trying to find it you don't go out there and look because you know it's hidden right here so when people try to go look for god in great complex things and you know god's hidden in simplicity amen when we get it so complicated that saint peter who could not read and write can't get it then we're way too complicated amen so except we become as a little children matthew chapter 6 verse 33 then the bible says seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things will be added unto you so jesus said there's a kingdom that i'm coming to build a kingdom and he said if you'll seek that kingdom first everything that you have need of in life he's going to add it to you and these are not just suggestions these are just not these are promises of god as a very young man i took these promises when we had great business opportunities somebody we got married we were very very uh poor and um and somebody came to us and made a great proposition to us a great business proposition probably taken care of all of our financial problems and it came down to this verse right here it was going to take me out of church it was going to take me away from a commitment to christ and i took this verse here seek ye first the kingdom of god and and all these things shall be added unto you and i took that verse and i based my whole life on that verse and i can tell you put god first in your life and he'll add everything that you have need of can you say amen to that maybe your weight in the balance see like i don't know if i should go to church and put god first and the devil will come and say look if you work i know the bible says six days shall labor and the seventh day you'll rest and dedicate it to god but boy i can make so much more money if i just worked on sunday or if i you know as we talked here a couple of weeks ago a lot of people instead of working five days a week and spending saturday with their family they work six days a week and then they put god on the back burner and do whatever they were going to do on saturday they do that on sunday they go to the store and they and they and when that should be a day dedicated to god brother ham said it was a holy day amen we don't go shopping and get gas and do those things on sunday this is a day dedicated to jesus christ somebody asked the other day and it was really phenomenal because christians we've been taught amen to go to church sunday morning and go to church sunday night somebody asked a question like what do people do on sunday night when they don't go to church what do they do if the day is dedicated to the lord pretty soon you find out all the things of the world start creeping in and you start working on sunday and this and this and all the things because i tell you what i got a thousand things back home that i could be doing and when i don't go to church then you you start doing those other thousand things it's good just to dedicate a day to the lord and say lord this is the day that you've made i'm gonna rejoice in it and i'm gonna show my children and my family that jesus christ is everything it's the most important thing i'm going to seek first the kingdom of god and god will add everything else that i need in my life he'll add it to me how do you know brother daniel because it says right there in matthew chapter 6 verse 33 that's why the devil a christian is no stronger than their knowledge and adherence to the word of god and i appreciate the brothers putting that up on the on the thing and i really do appreciate but i believe this is my heartfelt belief is that every person should have a bible this is god in letter form and you should have a a an experience with god it should come from the scriptures and when you have that i mean this is good for your mother you might nudge your husband say hey this would be good you should have a bible that you value amen and so that the bible says that it should be more than our daily meat god how jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god especially we father should have a bible i know this is really challenging but if you're going to lead your family hopefully you're leading them from the scripture and you can say hey it's not my word right here it's in the bible amen forsake not the assembling of yourselves together this is the lord's day amen we mark that in the scripture so when the devil will come and give you great propositions just like he said to jesus came look if you'll bow down and worship me i'll give you all the kingdoms of the world he'll make a lot of propositions he's come to me and made me a lot of propositions amen but my life is hidden in christ which is the word of god and we as men should have a bible and you go back and the devil tempts you go back right there matthew chapter 6 verse 33 no we're going to seek first the kingdom of god we're going to rise in the morning before the day starts and we're going to seek the kingdom of god the last thing of the day we're going to pull our family together we're going to pray and whatever we've gone through maybe the devil comes in like a flood we sit down and we read our bibles and we read our bibles and we pray together the family that prays together stays together i was thinking about that yesterday as i was going through that message he must be born again brother branham said because he was talking about this amazing message if you want to listen to it you must be born again brother branham was talking about every church believes in the new birth it doesn't matter you're baptist methodist pentecostal i think they said jimmy carter even was a born-again christian so it all comes down to a definition what do you call a born-again christian what is a born-again christian because jesus said that in in saint john chapter six uh if you i don't know if i put that one on there saint john chapter six if you have a bibles maybe we'll go back there saint john i'm sorry saint john chapter three now most of us can quote john 3 16 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved where'd you learn those verses brother daniel in a christian environment it just didn't happen it's being in a christian home and being in a christian school our parents they made great sacrifices for for me to be in a christian school actually my dad went and borrowed the money to put me in a christian school so i would be in a christian environment and that's not always possible but i believe brother m tells us that keep your children and christian fellowship as long as you can as long as you can come friday night and that's why we opened up the thing there the other friday night the kids are going to be somewhere they're going to be with some friends and this is going to be a real shocking revelation get ready your children are going to marry somebody that they know and one of their friends so whoever you put before them as friends they're going to marry one of those people so i say it's so important to keep them with good christian friends keep them with believers amen and not with the world amen so john 3 16 we can all quote that but if you go back just a few scriptures before this i know this is really slow and and maybe we're just going through but i think we should learn the scriptures they should become a part of us i mean just like your christian walk you mix many things together some of your sisters make cakes or you make bread and you mix maybe you're making bread my wife got a couple bread machines over there she's making bread the other night or the other day and you mix this ingredient this ingredient and then you mix it all up and then where's the sugar where's the milk where's the eggs they became part of it and we as christians we grow and this word should become part of us amen so as you add every time you come to church here a little there a little amen line upon line word upon word you add this to your christian life your christian walk with god that's why it's so important that we we talk about the bible brother yarborough had a big in influence on me i just knew him i met him a couple times but he had an influence and he was so uh such a preacher of the bible amen it's such a powerful thing in this world they've their minds have drifted off we need to get back to our bibles and hold it close as i said before so many times when kids have uh you know i ask them to consecrate their lives to god i want them to have their bible with them because we're not bringing you to this church we're not bringing you to brother daniel's ideas we're bringing people to the word of god and man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god amen i was thinking about that because we're not trying to get people to live by our creeds or my ideas i'm trying to get to you to the scriptures i might as i told my children i said look if daddy dies this is still the truth this is still the truth if if something you know brother perry green was here and he believed things and now he's gone but it's still the truth it's still the word of god brother yarborough preached the memorization of the scriptures and had that and now he's gone but it's still the scriptures it's still the truth and i tell you when you anchor your soul to the bible you'll stand i tell you the winds will blow who was it jesus said in in about the uh the winds he said whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and bl heareth them and do with them he'll be like a a tree no hold on a minute it's over in matthew isn't it matthew 7. and he says he'll be like a house it's built upon a rock and the rains descended and the floods came and they beat upon the house and it fell not because it was founded upon a rock amen in people's lives that's we were talking about wednesday night amen that those that hear the word of god he'll be planted like a river like a tree planted by the river of water the winds blow but the tree doesn't move why he's planted somewhere and our faith should be planted in the word of god when the winds blow when culture changes when they redefine marriage as a as a relationship between a woman and a woman and a man and a man your mind doesn't blow with that like well i guess live and let live no it goes back to the scripture jesus said therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife and they shall be one jesus christ instituted marriage he made the man and the woman and he defined marriage is that okay and you know what if it time goes on a hundred years and pretty soon because listen to me we've just seen the tip of the iceberg you wait five years and they'll say hey well if a man can marry a man and a woman a woman why can't i marry my horse and my horse get my life insurance when i die and why can't i marry my cat and my cat be on my health insurance you think this is just the end of it no it's just the beginning it's just the beginning the bible says by him all things consist the word of god amen is what causes this nation and our minds come together and you look how these little things blow and pretty soon they blow and pretty soon they say okay a girl you a little teenage girl you can say hey i'm a boy and then you can go in the boy's bathroom and pretty soon it goes brother man said pretty soon we get so smart and then it backfires on us and all the women like hey we want equal rights we want to be right with the men i mean like you're right you're right equal rights we want to be equal with you but guess what we're going to have we're going to then have the right to be in every one of your sports events and we have testosterone so we're way more physically advanced from you and we take all of your awards because we can run faster we can lift more weights because we have a god-given testosterone in our body and now they're screaming like oh it's backfired no no no you can't be a transgender and be in our sports no no you can it's got to go both ways you see how all things consist just the simple things of life totally remodeling every bathroom has to be because now it has to be transgender you see how these little things they go and they pass a little legislation the bice the bible says by him all things consists it's held together and when you take god out of the equation then the whole thing becomes a muck it all falls apart oh let's just christians keep the mind of christ jesus said let the mind that was in christ let it be inside of you lord let your mind be inside of me so saint john chapter 3 praise the lord we don't have a quarterly that we give out you we've got a few notes here but we don't know where the holy spirit is going to help us because we got you say oh it doesn't bother me i sit in my house and listen to brother branham but our children don't sit there they're out there engaging every day in work and realizing that hey if i say this one thing right here i could lose my whole career i could lose everything that i have i just and so the bible says be jesus tells us don't go out there and just say hey no he said be wise as serpents and harmless as a dove you can never come you have to realize especially brother people go to college like i got this education i got this and but you have to realize in a moment's time you're going to be asked to either keep your education and conform to this world or give it all up in a moment's time oh brother daniel i couldn't do that well then maybe you couldn't be a christian because joseph got to the place in that place where he was way up in the corporate world and remember potiphar's wife come and ask for sexual favors and he gave up his whole career and went to a prison here's who was at daniel he was 80 something years old and they passed the law it says you can't pray and he said i'm going to pray i don't care what and they said well you're going to the lions then he said well put me in the lion then or maybe we've got shadrach meshach and a three bend to go three little children there and say look we're gonna play this music and when we play this music we want you to dance and we want you to do this and we want you to compromise your morals i said look you don't have to give us another chance because we're so deeply rooted our faith is in jehovah god and you don't have to the result is going to be the same oh blessed be the name of jesus i trust they're still christians today like shadrach meshach and abednego and they have an experience with god and their roots go very deep into the word of god it doesn't matter they say look we're going to throw you in the fiery furnace this wasn't a virtual fire they heated up seven times hotter and the men that were throwing them in there actually died oh but a little persecution all it did was break their bonds off of them i think that'll do what it'll do for us sometimes a little persecution cause you to raise your hands and say oh lord jesus i love you father blessed be the name of god maybe you maybe you never could worship the lord freely and then god sends a little sickness along you preaching it causes you to pray and seek the lord a little more then he heals your body it causes you to be thankful lord i thank you for today lord i thank you for your health lord i thank you for family i thank you for church i thank you for music i thank you for our song leaders we ought to be a thankful people it's amazing in america we feel like this is entitlement and i i deserve this i deserve this the bible says naked came we into the world and naked we're going to go out it's really amazing listen to me now this isn't even in my notes we see socialism taking over our country what those people died for in south korea to fight back socialism it has taken over our country and people lose their job because of a pandemic like look we're going to plant a garden i'm going to get two little part-time jobs and we're going to make this thing work and the government comes in with socialism and look look just stay at home we'll send you a stimulus check just stay at home and they're training the people to become dependent on the government if they send you a stimulus check hey they're sending it to everybody take it cash it and use it but remember the devil has a plan amen he has a plan and brother m tells us that one day america will go bankrupt and then rome will come and buy it out with strings attached well look we'll pay you'll have your 401k you'll have your retirement back but there's just these little strings we got attached to it like these radical christian people we need to shut their churches down don't think you're going to be exempt from that amen they persecuted our fathers before us but there was a church that grew stronger amen when they gathered in the catacombs you were only in the catacombs for a reason you knew that your faith was the most important thing in your life it was above your careers above your family it was everything which are faith in jesus christ or you weren't there so persecution has always made the true church of god stronger and stronger and stronger maybe fewer numbers but we're not looking for numbers jesus is looking for quality if he was looking for numbers you know how do you say any man that's not willing to take up his cross and follow me is not worthy to be my disciple he wasn't looking for followers he was looking for disciples disciples are people comes from the word discipline people he said you're not worthy to be my disciplined student so he wasn't looking to have all these people he was looking for people that were willing to be disciplined and when he got all done he had 12 and one of them was a devil and then a few hours later peter was a cousin preacher denied he ever knew and so jesus said look i gotta i'm gonna go away because walking with you that's why it's people think well if i was with the preacher i would he could just but no peter was right on the boat and all and he discussed i don't even know anything about this religion i don't know anything about this what did he need he needed an experience with jesus christ and what happened on the upper room when the holy ghost came down and filled his life amen it gave him what he needed he ran out into the streets and this same jesus that you crucified as both lord and christ and that's what all of us need we need an experience with god i'm telling you that's what's happening around us and people they come and they're associated with a message and people and maybe even i hear great testimonies people give me their testimonies moving from california following the message and maybe mom and dad brought the the and they moved here but unless every one of those children had an experience with god they'll just drift off somewhere you must be born again i'm trying to get the scripture here saint john chapter 3 verse 1 there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same came to jesus by night and he said unto him rabbi most people criticize him because he came at night but you got to remember he came a lot of people don't even come they just like sit back and criticize but this man at least came to jesus and he said rabbi we know that there are a teacher come from god and no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him jesus answered and said unto him verily verily so he punctuated it this is very important very very important jesus said verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of heaven he can't understand you say hey do you see that like hey don't go through that door there's spider on the floor like no you don't understand it's a tarantula it's a tarantula like oh i see him he bite me and i'll hurt me right now you understand you so jesus said except a man be born again he can't understand why those women wear dresses can't understand why a man would take a book and let that book regulate his life let me just say this do you realize in 20 years when you can't buy a book just like you can't buy a rotary phone and the bible the book is a pdf portable document file and you tell a young generation look your life has to be governed by that pdf file or you'll go to hell like that's a bunch of nonsense you see how technology and science is taken away and how that as we go on it'll become more and more difficult whereas now you have a physical bible and it represents god my friend you did some very terrible things he said i'd go to hotels and things he said but i always took the bible and i put it in the drawer out of the because it represented god i think it's so important even to have your children have the bible visible this is the word of god this isn't a newspaper this isn't a magazine this is the word of god and our lives will be judged by the word of god i think even around our message we've forgotten the power and what this word means that we're going to be judged by this word amen they asked brother random about ministers preaching twice he doesn't even answer the question he just said look he quotes timothy and titus and said there's the answer and he just moves right on from it because it's written in the scripture we're going to be judged by the scripture that's why when if something's written in the scripture and we say lord let me live the word of god how. amen lord let me live it so that jesus says except a man be born again he can't see the kingdom of god nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born jesus answered verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit marvel not that i say unto you ye must it's in red right ye must be born again the wind blew us where it lists us and now here's the sound thereof but can't not tell whence it cometh or whether it goes so is everyone that is born of the spirit of god and i was listening to this message brother iran preaches the whole message and he takes the the the churches and their denominations and their everybody has an idea but the bible the word of the lord comes to a prophet so he takes this subject and preaches a host sermon on this subject the prophet of god was sent in this day to clear up our ideas so we had an idea of the rapture and my minister friends they criticized me we're sitting with a bunch of brothers they're like you got this idea and they gave me a label like you're this this i don't know you label me whatever but i just lowered my voice i said hey if you brothers would go back and listen to the tape of the rapture brother and preaches for two hours on the subject of a rapture so if we're going to listen and talk about the rapture or talk about the future home or we'll talk about the holy spirit brother and preach the whole series on the holy spirit or he must be born again and he preaches a message on it brother man i just want to read a couple things here brother ram said the approach to this new new birth he said to approach it it and to be this approach this birth he said you have to go through a process just like anything that lives anything that lives again it has to die first how jesus say except the corn of wheat fall into the ground it abides alone so all of us are we are born we have a life and if it doesn't isn't born again it just dies and rots like the little grain of wheat a corn but if it goes into the ground it comes forth again so it has to die first and he said you cannot keep your same spirit you cannot keep your same habits you cannot keep your same thoughts you got to die you got to die like he died so he talked about abel how he died on the altar and cain killed him there and so i was thinking of the scripture he that is born of god is a new creature old things are passed away and all things are become new that's second corinthians chapter 5 verse 17. so all of us are born with an old nature we've been through that before but jesus said he that is born he's a new creature he's a new creation so you see people that say they're born again and then they still have that same old nature hateful mean temper dress women dress in moral clothes and cut their hair they've never been born again i don't have time to read through this whole thing brother rem said you got to die he said die how to yourself die to everything so that you can be born again you've got to do that he said if you don't die you can't never live again it's amazing because this was a new year's eve service and he said he said it's not turn a new page it's actually die and be born again you have to feel so guilty when you stand in his presence whether you go the methodist way or the baptist way or whatever way you go you got to feel so guilty and feel so guilty it'll kill you amen he said you've got to reckon yourself so guilty in the presence of god till your worldly life dies right there and the sin question is over for you when you're standing in his presence and when you look at that you're sure to live again when you're dead he said you see what i'm coming to the new birth he said first is to die in order to be born again you've still got the things of the world in you you're not born again he talks about the serpent jesus a few chapter verses down from this and he talks about the serpent as moses lifted up the serpent on the uh how was it verse 14 and moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up and how that that serpent was made of brass which was a symbolism of the serpent in the garden which was dead and it was judged it was brass brass speaks of judgment and so brother adam is bringing this out and showing us most people don't understand why it was brass it was it was sin being judged and christ hung on a cross and he became sin for us that's what the scripture says he became sin who knew no sin amen he became he took how does he say he became sin that you might become his righteousness and so he hung on a cross and he become just as that serpent was hanging their breasts but he was crystallized there was nothing it was petrified and brother ram said that's why you have to die to your old nature and your habits and desires and that's where most people they don't want to do that they don't want to they just want to i want to raise my hand accept christ as my savior i don't want to burn in hell but that's not what jesus said except a man be born again he can't enter the kingdom of heaven jesus goes on to say he said if jesus said except a man be born of water and of spirit we had a prophet come and he interpreted these words he said being born of water is ephesians chapter 5 he said you're washed by the water of the word so being born of the water and of the spirit you have to be washed by the water of the word so it's people like oh i just want to be born again so churches have their like come up and sign the church book and put your name on the book we'll send you a letter now you're a member now you're born again but that's not what jesus said except you be born of water and of the holy spirit you can't enter the kingdom of god so you have to be willing to be washed by the water of the word so when the word says it's a shame for a woman to cut her hair you have to be washed from your ideas when the bible says it's a shame that a woman should be dressed in modest apparently say i don't want to be dressed in modest apparel i just want to run around with these leggings or whatever they are and these they're how's the bible prophesied in revelations chapter 3 he said that they'll be naked it was the attribute of our age it would be naked we were driving down the road i seen a lady the other day and i said you know those leggings are nothing but skin they're naked before god it's a fulfillment of scripture if you'll look at that brothers and you'll look at that you won't be tempted by those things you'll look at it and say that's the fulfillment of revelation chapter 3 the church and the last day would be naked before god and we see it it's nakedness portrayed before us may god help us to throw away our lust and be born again amen not of corruptible seed but by the word of god not by this church you're born again of the spirit of god and you're washed by the water of the word of god has nothing to do with brother daniel has nothing to do with this church it has has everything to do with you being washed by the water of the word and god coming and birthing you by the spirit of god into his kingdom and when he burst you into the kingdom no man can take you out no blessed be the name of the lord brother matthew i had so many people put me out said brother daniel you're this one brother wrote a book and they like this and like hey here's the word test you write this and you go through this and i wouldn't even have been a message believer he wrote this big thick book i thought i guess i'm not i don't believe the message well when a few years later his mind got twisted around he didn't even believe the the source of the book that he wrote and he left the message and everything i tell you i don't want to you know the world or nobody in this message put me into this thing jesus christ came and he found me one day when i was going my way and i was doing my thing and i was just not a good person he came and he found me amen and he delivered me and he set me free when i tried to reform myself he birthed me into a kingdom of god and the habits and desires and he broke those things from my life and he'll do the same for you today this is not a theory this is a resurrected jesus christ coming back and dealing with people's life he said i've come that you might have life and you might have it more abundantly you don't have to be addicted to those things you can be free and he that the sun sets free he's free indeed oh so good to be a christian today amen amen brother man said people want shortcuts he said there's no shortcuts he said you have to come the way of calvary he said you have to come the way of the brass altar you have to come the way of the brazen serpent you die you actually die oh god if i can't say it right you die literally you die to yourself you die to the things of the world and are born anew amen no things of the world no world the things of the world is dead no shortcuts they want to come quickly listen this is so amazing brother i was talking about people wanting to come quickly it's like the magic one religion i come and say except jesus and we wave a wan over you and you're a christian no you have to die to your own self jesus said he that is not willing to come and take up his cross and follow me is not worthy to be my disciple my wife sent me that verse this morning i don't have my phone phone she texted to me and he says deny himself and take up his cross see i got a right brother daniel this is i can do whatever i want yes you're right you can do it but jesus said if you won't come and deny yourself and take up your cross and and deny your all of your ideas and take up the word of god he said you're not worthy to be my disciple now do you see why jesus said straight is the gate narrow is the way and very few people in lady ocean will be willing to lay down their own ideas in their own life and take up their cross and follow the lord jesus christ amen but i feel something calling me this morning amen something it's not me because it's not natural it's supernatural or something comes inside of me remember when they were crucifying christ they said we will not have this man to rule over us and what is christ he is the word of god you see how the people the religious people were the ones persecuting christ trying to kill the word of god and they say we will not have the word of god rule over us i'm not going to have that book tell me how to dress i'm not going to have that book tell me how to run my life but there's a group of people said i want the word of god to rule over me hey man i want that i mean the bride has made herself ready i mean she says lord that is your word i want to live by the word of god there is a select group of people that say lord i want your word to rule over me i know i'm going to be judged by it and you'll be either be judged today or you'll be judged as a great white throne judgment the bible says some men's sins go before and they say god forgive me they go before and they're forgiven or they come afterward they're saying lord i am lord have we cast out devils in your name we've done many mighty works and then he said hey bring that bring the record of their life they bring them up now right here you sat in a church and we told you to be baptized in jesus name and you were baptized in father son and holy spirit never were baptized in the name of jesus christ he said depart from me you worker of iniquity i never knew you you knew it was right no one was baptizing father son and holy spirit they were all baptized in the name of jesus christ i love the lord don't you sometimes i talk fast as i'm so passionate about the word of god brother rem says it's so amazing he said they want shortcuts they want to grow up quick and they don't want to grow he said you grow in the lord it takes growth and experience he said when you're born again god vindicates you that's how god vindicates all his nature is by their fruits people like oh i made a commitment to god i said praise the lord you just keep pressing on and you know how we'll know if god really did something for you by your fruits they're fruits you'll know them see people's like oh i love jesus and then they go out and never have a change they cuss and live and do they've never been washed by the water of the word because the bible says let no filthy communication proceed from your mouth so brother daniel you're just making i could never do that oh praise the lord then you're the perfect candidate to be born of the spirit of god because i nobody in this room can do it it takes the holy spirit jesus said i'm not going to leave you comfortless peter i'm not going to leave you out there as a custom preacher i'm going to come to you i'll be with you i'll be inside of you how paul said the life that i now live i live by the faith of the son of god that died and gave himself for me i tell you if you're living overcoming life you can truly say it's not by power it's not by might it's by the spirit of god that's what all of us need to do just say lord take me lord i want to be washed by the water of the word lord take every desire that's not like you lord and wash it clean my mind and let the holy spirit come and fill my life amen the bible says he seeks to and fro over the earth to find anybody that will find that'll open their heart up how we revelation chapter three if any man hear my voice and we'll open the door i'll come into him and sup with them oh isn't such an amazing promise of god maybe you're living alone maybe maybe you're older and you just have your house and you have a scripture and the bible says if you'll hear the voice of god and you open your door you know we we have these i don't know metaphors are hard to open it but sometimes it's good to just open the door of your house and open it say jesus will you come into my house sometimes when i preach i'd like to get a silhouette one of those cardboard cutouts they do it of trump and those they're i like to cut one of jesus and have him just stand there and then when i read his word he can't say it because he has no lips but my lips but you could look at him and said jesus wrote that jesus wrote that and it bring a visibility before us amen may god help us that's why we close our eyes when you pray you close your eyes and it shuts all the world out and you're just alone with the lord jesus amen we're not getting very far in this subject are we he that is born of god is a new creature old things are passed away and everything's become new they asked him in acts 2 said how do i get saved he said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit i mean you know sometimes we just run through life and even come to church and just hear it but we don't really hear it sometimes it's better not to scream it's just to slow down and say am i really hearing what that man says god i want to be washed by the water of the word lord we've got you take and say you know lord i want my home to be different i want my family to be different i want my bad attitude lord wash that bad attitude away maybe we get a self-righteous spirit jesus he came to seek and to save that which was lost one time they drug a woman and say look we've caught a right in the very act of adultery we caught her right in the very act of adultery i don't know if we've been through this before the holy spirit just brings me right to this point here say we've got her and our law says the stoner and the bible says jesus said no you just begin to write it doesn't say what he wrote but it said when they observed what he was writing they just everyone dropped their stone and turned and walked away we got a little plaque in our house it says drop the stone drop the stone so it's so easy to pick up a stone and jesus said any one of you that's without sin you pick up your stone and you throw it first and then they all walked away and jesus said where are your accusers she said i have none lord you know people don't realize that there's a place of repentance that every person can come to we don't you know we confess our sins to god and he forgives us and he forgets it he doesn't remember it's the one to see if his forgetfulness we don't have that ability because we're human we say oh yeah god will forgive you then we remember that but we must remember that when this lady comes somewhere between being caught in an act of adultery i want to just stop right there because there's been a lot of discussion why jesus didn't stone her because he said i didn't come to destroy the law i came to fulfill it right so why didn't jesus tell have her stone well everybody's got their opinion my opinion is they caught him in the very act so they had the man right the law said they had to bring the man and the woman together so who really broke the law they did by not bringing the man and the woman so jesus couldn't fulfill have the woman stone because that the law was that they brought both of them and they stoned them both so jesus would have actually been breaking the law if he said look stone the woman how many understand that so he said where you're accused you said i have none lord somewhere between that they catching her and bringing her that place she found a place to repent and she i don't know where it was maybe it's when she heard the name we're dragging you to jesus and she thought you know i remember jesus he's the one that touched the woman at the well maybe we went to the well together down there and i and and she was delivered and god forgave her she had five husbands and maybe somewhere said oh god would you forgive me too and when they got right to the place and they had their stones and he said well where why don't you cast the first stone if you've never made a mistake in your life sometimes adults get to that place and like man especially young people we deal with a lot a lot of young people like parents like this and this is going on at church and asking this girl cut her hair and yeah i stopped like wait wait wait just a minute what were you doing when you were 15 years old oh we were just out in the world running around smoking dope and getting drunk and running living like this like wait a minute these kids are making trying to make a step for christ trying to do something and when you stand up and say i'm a christian you get baptized every gun in hell is pointed at you just like our brother joseph he made a stand and got baptized the devil said look i'll put him through a trial we'll see every son that comes to god must be tested and tried and when you play stand up and say i'm a christian and you raise your hand say lord i'm going to start doing watch the devil come after you make you prove what you've made a confession for christ you make a step and the devil's going to fight you oh but jesus said greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world amen that little faith that something that you believe on the lord jesus christ that you shall be saved there's some that faith is greater amen paul said the life that i now live i live by the faith of the son of god he says in another place he said the power that doth work in you it's the faith of jesus it's not your faith it's his faith maybe even in your family god doesn't he give everybody but he's given you a desire for god the son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost so you're sitting here today for a reason this is this is what i believe peter when it says the bible says work out your own salvation and you realize where's the rest of my family where's people that are better why aren't they why don't they have it but god's given you a desire for god he's given you a desire for god and jesus said how do you say it over there he said i've i've ordained you you have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you that you go and bear fruit and we we went through that on on was it wednesday how as many uh those that bear fruit he said i'm going to prune it i'm the vine year the branches the the branch that brings forth fruit he said i prune it that it might bring forth more fruit well i'm trying brother daniel but god wants to prune more things away from you you'll bring more of a fruit and more of a testimony and others will see it and say how do you say it i will dangerous you go and bear fruit and that they would glorify your father which is in heaven not that we get the glory it's jesus christ that wants the glory amen i've got so many things here but i don't think we're going to get to all of it today i say lord i want to be born again not just of tucson tabernacle's idea not even a brother daniel's idea but lord i want to be washed by the water of the word of god i want the word of god to wash me and wash my mind and that bad attitude and that unforgiving and that self-righteous spirit and religious spirit i want all of it gone lord i want to be born again not of corruptible seed but i want to be born again by the word of god and lord i want the spirit of god to come and live inside of me that's not an arrogant spirit it's not a proud spirit it's a humble holy spirit amen maybe our musicians have come i've got a lot of notes you can see here they are and we've only got through a couple of them but god knows what he's doing in every one of our lives he knows every tear that you've cried he knows every heartache every pain that you have i see our brother and sister back there they're aged but god knows them he knows their name he knows all about them he knows everything about you i love the lord jesus like that i want to serve him i mean this thing is a lot bigger than me but he's got it all in control as that little song says he's got it all in control he's got all of this in control before you ever came into the world before you made your first sin two thousand years ago he died on the cross he knew that you would be a sinner and he made a way and as if we went through it before the bible says he's wounded for our transgressions and he was bruised for your iniquities what is iniquity it's knowing to do good and you didn't do it and he went ahead and took the bruises 2 000 years ago because he knew you would do it i tell you when you have that day on calvary just makes you humble makes you want to love him maybe you're sick in your body and he said look i'm gonna go ahead and put the stripes on my back i'm gonna put a promise in there and by my stripes they can be healed it's all in that atonement of calvary we've got a cross here doesn't have jesus on it because he died and rose again he said because i live you can live also you feel that real gentle feeling how many raise your hand say i feel that brother daniel it's not something i feel in my flesh but god is a spirit and you feel that gentle timidness of the holy spirit he said the son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost he's trying to draw us to him amen let's just bow our heads together heavenly father lord i don't know

saw a new heaven and a new earth descending from god out of heaven you know how i know that's true because back at the first part it said he that is born of god is a new creature old things have passed away all things become new i tried to be a good person and i couldn't be a good person but i was born again by the washing of the water to the word and by the spirit of god and i became a new creature in christ jesus and if that part of the word of god is true then i believe the last part of the word of god is true christianity is just not for weak people that need a crutch of faith amen it's for strong people i know that educated i've heard it said like you christians you're a bunch of weak people need a little crutch no in noah's day there was eight people that had faith in the word of god and we still hear their names but we don't hear all those people that died and then the bible says that the righteous are going to walk out on the ashes of the wicked that's not a crutch that's using wisdom jesus said he that here at these sayings of mine and do with them is a wise man not very many wise people today amen but i want to be a wise person i want to hear the word of god amen as we go let's just let the word of god let it dwell in our heart let it speak to you amen as you go let it speak to you maybe invite your family say hey you should should feel the presence of god maybe you know somebody that's got away from god invite him to come out and feel the presence of god our brother anthony's coming uh tonight to be baptized he had to work this morning he's 18 year old boy i don't understand what bible says we read it there the wind blows where it lists us you don't know where it came from you don't know where it's going all you know the holy spirit is doing something he's doing something in our lives how many know what i'm talking about god's doing something don't sit back and try to figure out you say lord the wind blew it's blowing where it lists this young boy i don't know where he came from but he wants to be baptized let's just baptize him and let the lord lead him on in his life amen he said i don't know anything i don't know about jesus i don't know anything well that's okay god will train him amen he that is born of god god will lead him he'll guide him he'll direct us and that's way in every one of our life he knows just exactly who you are he knows your children he'll guide and direct every situation of life if we'll surrender our lives to him now you can be like samson and just get it in your head i'm gonna go and i'm gonna do this well that's okay but if you're a child of god you're gonna come back and you might be grinding at the mill of alimony paying child support and you're like you know what i didn't have to be doing this i could have been doing what's right but that's all right god found samson you come back and he said lord remember me avenge me lord use my strength and more died in his death with the testimony than he did in his whole life so you might make mistakes don't let that be the end just come back remember zacchaeus he come jesus called him out of the tree he said right now lord if i've done anything wrong to someone i'll repay it if i've stolen something he said i'll repay it four times he just made his wrongs right blessed be the name of the lord god bless you in the balcony good to have you all with

give them a workout can't sleep in the soundbar brother daniel's around brother aaron pray for us lord we we've heard your word today and i know how it how you spoke to me made me think for a moment what is it that that makes me battle from willing to surrender lord so sometimes we get a little maybe high-minded too much pride we're embarrassed lord but let us forsake all of that just completely healed to you yes and let you have your own way lord and then be able to say it was worth it all lord we thank you for your word today lord may you minister to each heart even during the day today we look at ourselves closely sometimes we just we just want to hear all the pats on the back and all that and there's time for that too but sometimes we need our soul search very closely lord let that be
