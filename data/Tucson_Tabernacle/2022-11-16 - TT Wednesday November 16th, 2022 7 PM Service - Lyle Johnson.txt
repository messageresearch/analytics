you Sunday morning if you were here brother Matt Watkins brought us a powerful message about the anointing of the supernatural Sunday evening at Shalom Tabernacle brother Paul Dirksen brought a striking message about the atonement I want to share with you tonight what I believe the Lord's placed on my heart for this evening some of it will be a bit of a follow-up from Sunday but before we do that let's petition our heavenly father one more time ask his Blessing oversight and guidance Lord Jesus it is such a privilege to be here to be here amongst your people purchased by your blood Lord Jesus that you loved each one of us individually so much that you would go through that sacrifice Lord how we love you how we should respond to that Lord I pray that you'd help me tonight Lord to just not be here as Lyle Johnson but Lord to be able to step aside and somehow yield to you that you could speak words of encouragement words whatever they happen to be that are needed by whoever happens to be hearing them wherever I might misspeak Lord may you translate into the ears of the hearers Lord for those that are not able to be here but are are streaming the service or dialing in Lord I pray that your presence would be with them and Lord draw us closer to yourself help prepare us Lord for that great day that we believe will soon be upon us when we'll be caught up together to be with you forever we thank you Lord Jesus we thank you again for this blessed opportunity in Jesus precious name we pray amen while we're still standing in honor of his word we'll we'll be reading from second Kings chapter two it's part of the text that brother Watkins used Sunday morning but for context the setting is the time that Elijah was taken up in Elisha received the spirit that had animated Elijah into what he called a double portion the two of them were walking together quite some distance and the map on the screen you see Jerusalem in the lower left it's circled in blue just as a point of reference Bethel is in the upper left this is where Jacob had built an altar many centuries earlier were jeroboam had built a shrine with the golden calf after the breakup of the United Kingdom into the kingdoms of Israel and Judah as they walked through Bethel Elijah told Elisha stay here but Elisha said no well they continued on to Jericho they they went down this this path here approximately that's about 14 miles at Bethel the elevation is a couple thousand feet Jericho is about 1200 feet below sea level so they had about a 3 000 foot elevation change and they're walking along again as they got to Jericho Elijah turned to Elisha and said you you wait here and Elisha said no he refused to be dissuaded from staying with the prophet well they continued their journey together another few miles to the Jordan River it's a rightmost location marked on the map Elijah removed his cloak or his coat or outer garment the King James version says his mantle and struck the surface of the river with it the waters parted and the two of them crossed on dry ground now this is near or at the very place that Joshua had crossed into Canaan almost 600 years prior when the priests bore the Ark of the Covenant and the waters parted at the time of the spring flood for the entire assembly the entire Congregation of Israel to cross it's also the same place where Jesus would be baptized some 900 years later by John another one with the spirit of Elijah well let's join them now second Kings 2 verse 9. we mean it came to pass when they Elijah and Elisha were gone over the the parted Waters of the Jordan which closed behind them after they crossed over that Elijah finally said to Elisha ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee up until now it's been mostly stay here I'm gonna go on stay here but now it's okay what do you want Elisha said I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me and Elijah said to Elisha you've asked a hard thing nevertheless if you see me when I'm taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so and it came to pass as they still went on and talked I I wonder what they were talking about I wonder what their conversation was well as they communed behold there appeared a chariot of Fire and Horses of Fire and parted them both asunder and Elijah went up not by the fiery chariot but by a whirlwind into heaven and Elisha saw it and he cried my father my father The Chariot of Israel the horsemen thereof and Elisha saw Elijah no more and Elisha took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces a sign of anguish grief morning please be seated Elisha had requested a double portion of the spirit that was on Elijah what does a double portion mean the Bible records twice as many miracles for Elisha as for Elijah is that what a double portion means is this a mathematical construct of some sort or or is this perhaps some kind of an of an idiomatic expression an indirect way of saying that Elisha knowing that Elijah was soon to be gone and realizing that Israel needed that prophetic Ministry to continue desired to be Elijah's successor with the same Spirit upon him not to be a Moses he didn't want a double portion of Moses spirit not to be a Samuel whose Ministries were for a different time but to be a continuation of Elijah's Ministry the anointing or Spirit appropriate for that moment in history how does one have twice as much of the spirit of God as another person how does one measure such things I'm sure God knows he knows how to measure he knows how to allocate I don't well the topic Sunday morning was the supernatural anointing I believe is what the brother called it but but what does that mean well in the Old Testament the word anoint or anointing is typically used to describe an oil often combined with other aromatic ingredients a common context is that it's poured on or applied to a person being installed in a high office perhaps a priest or a high priest perhaps a king the word is first mentioned in the book of Exodus and last mentioned and the writings of Isaiah in the New Testament the Greek words translated as anoint or anointing are usually ones that again mean an ointment or an oil or applying it like anointing the sick with oil or when the woman poured the expensive ointment on Jesus feet we know that in the Bible oil is a representation it's a symbol of the Holy Spirit well and and this and some of the scriptures we'll be reading this evening you might want to pay attention to the use of the terms thee or thy or ye and you recall and King James English this this second person pronoun if it starts with the th thee thy thou it's it's a singular it's addressed to one person or one nation or one entity but if it begins with a Y like ye or you then it's a plural it's it's there might be the congregation but the plural is the Believers within that congregation don't get too hung up on that but I'd like to read to you from from first John chapter 2. it says the anointing which you have received from him abideth lives in you you need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teaches you of all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it hath taught you you shall abide live in him the the Greek word used in this passage of scripture is chrisma it literally means an unquote it's translated as anointing but in this context it means the Holy Spirit so we can read this verse from the Apostle John as but the Holy Spirit which you have received of him lives in you you need not that any man teach you but is the same Holy Spirit teaches you all things and is truth and there's no lie even it has taught you you shall live in him so John's writing to a group that he calls his little children and note John's using the plural so he's addressing each person within this group so the obvious conclusion I suppose is it for a church for a group for a church to be Spirit-filled we need to each be individually filled with the Holy Spirit the undercurrent is we need each other just like the emperor penguins need each other to survive the cold dark winter they huddle in close Fellowship together there's not a lot of social distancing in that picture they do this to survive and they rotate in that huddle so each carries a portion of the load bearing one another's burdens and so fulfilling the law of Christ comes to mind now if one of those Penguins leaves the group it'll perish the group the weakened will still survive at the end of his ministry Jesus told his disciples that the Holy Spirit which he would send from the father is the spirit of truth it confirms that we just read in first John that the the Charisma that lives in them and teaches them is truth therefore it's the Holy Spirit John 16 13 how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever ye shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come it's the same thing teaching by that Holy Spirit of Truth so just simplify when we speak of a supernatural anointing the anointing of the supernatural we're speaking of the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit living in and working through us individually and as a body I want to be part of that don't you well moving on a few weeks ago I spoke on Ephesians possessing the promises we discussed that Paul wrote about a revelation that he received from the Lord in chapter 3 having expounded on Unity faith and Reconciliation let's read Ephesians 3 starting at verse 1. Paul's after expounding on these things says for this cause I Paul the prisoner of the Roman government wait it doesn't say that that was the outward appearance but in reality before his arrest before his deportation to Rome he was already the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you gentiles again he's writing to a gentile Church people who would until recently been pagans and all that that implies he goes on if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which has given me to you word for your benefit how that by Revelation he made known unto me the mystery as I wrote before in few words whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge and the mystery of Christ he goes on this mystery which in other Ages was not made known Unto the Sons of man it's now revealed unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit and this is the revelation of that mystery that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs joint heirs with Israel and of the same not a different or separate but the same body singular one body not two not many one and partakers of sharing in his promise in Christ by the gospel the not just the good news but for these guys for us it's really good news well I imagine this this was a little hard for the Gentiles and Ephesus to understand much less to appreciate okay we're allowed to derive all the benefits of Judaism but without all the rules wonderful there's a problem and the problem is that the practice of the Jewish religion in Paul's day was adherence to a set of rules the law given by God himself on Mount Sinai through Moses to the people if you obey this I'll do that if you don't look out look at this not just from the perspective of the Gentiles or their Church of Ephesus but what about the perspective of the Jewish people the chosen of God are now to relinquish or or maybe more accurately to share there are privileged position as the chosen which by the way they received by grace and which they attempt to maintain by careful observance of all the rules as they've been commanded by God to keep and now this position of being the chosen is suddenly going to include all sorts of rabble from their perspective also by grace who by the way neither know nor have to keep all those rules let's recall how the Jewish Nation came to the place of being the chosen God is addressing the congregation through Moses Deuteronomy 7. verse 6 we read for thou singular the nation Thou Art and holy set aside a sanctified people unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God hath chosen thee that's that's choosing the nation as a unit and the nation didn't choose him there was no election campaign no counting of ballots no ranked Choice voting no waiting for the results the nation yes special unto himself above this isn't above as an over or ruling but above as in selected or apart from all people that are on the face of the Earth watch out for bride Pride Israel the Lord did not set his love upon you now the plural form speaking to each member of that Nation nor choose you because you were more in number than any other people you are the fewest of all people compared to the planet's population you represented an insignificant percentage a drop in the bucket but here's why you're chosen first because the Lord loved you and next because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers not literally their fathers but their ancestors Patriarchs Abraham Isaac Jacob because of his oath to them hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand this wasn't done in a corner and redeemed you out of the house of bond men they no longer have any claim on you and from the hand of pharaoh king of Egypt the superpower of that time and place no therefore from this you can rest assured you can be fully confident that the Lord thy God he is God the faithful God which keeps Covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his Commandments to a thousand Generations that's not a math equation well a thousand how long is your generation when's the Lord going to stop keeping his Covenant and of between 20 and 40 000 years no no no it means continually it's just an expression so we see Israel was chosen of God because God wanted to express his love and demonstrate his reliability to and through a group that would otherwise be easily overlooked or ignored at Sinai we're told that people chose law over Grace prior to that they had the Covenant of Noah what were the rules under the norwayic Covenant don't eat blood don't murder be fruitful and multiply not too many rules and with Abraham he added one more circumcision that's not a lot it's pretty much it well not let's review the calling of the Gentiles us of Ephesians chapter two starting at verse 1. and you Paul says again plural speaking to each member of the Ephesian Church you hath he quickened that means Made Alive who were dead in trespasses and sins so they're not just made alive like a newborn they're resurrected from death they were dead and are now alive wherein that is in that state of trespass and sin and time passed before you were quickened you walked you lived according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air Satan the spirit that now works and the children of disobedience what we call Satan's Eden among whom that is among the children of Disobedience also we all we Paul has changed from telling them to including himself in that group he's a Jew Jew in tangile we had our conversation our way of life in Times past and the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the Mind and we're by Nature the children of Wrath even as others we weren't special or even distinguishable from the mass of humanity around us but God who is Rich virtually without limit and abundance and mercy kindness forgiveness for his tiny no for his great love wherewith He Who God loved who us that includes you I'm thankful by faith I can claim it includes me even when we all of us were already worse past tense we're already dead in sins hath quickened brought us to life resurrected redeemed cooking does together with United Us in and with Christ and then he tells us by goodness oh no it doesn't say that by diligent effort no by unmerited favor by grace are you saved and have already half he's already raised us up us Jew and Gentile together that's an important word it's an important concept it's the title of the sermon together together is to gather together and made us sit with social distancing made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come time without end he might show the exceeding the boundless the Limitless the incomparable the infinite Riches of his grace how in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus for by by that very boundless Grace are ye each and all saved from death and destruction through faith which you worked hard to achieve no not of yourselves not by your own efforts the grace that brought you that Faith it's a gift it's tendered to us of God now as with any gift if I offer it to you you have to accept it you have to possess it you have to reach out and take it otherwise it's offered but if you don't receive it it has no value to you it has no benefit Paul underscores this by rephrasing he says again it's not of works it's not by what you do he says lest lest that's an interesting word one syllable but it means in order to prevent that any man should boast and now the verse brother Aaron's been patiently expounding to us for we Paul the Believers at Ephesus you here tonight me we are his who's God's workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto for the purpose of good works wait a minute we're not doing it by works but we're created so we have we're here we're created to do the things God requires your desires of us our Salvation is not dependent or earned by that or through them it's a response what we do is a response which God hath before ordained that we should so live that we should walk in them well let's skip down to verse 13. but someday no it doesn't say that no but now where in Christ Jesus who who sometimes at other times in the past were far off Outsiders have been made by brought in made Insiders how by the blood of Christ the life is in the blood the the the nephesh the Hebrew the the nature the nature of that life is in the blood that he shed for us for he who Jesus is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us between Jew and Gentile between man and God the song that we sang as we opened the service he is our peace he is broken down every wall so Paul says he's broken down that middle wall of partition between us verse 15 having abolished banished destroyed cast away from us in his flesh the enmity the adversarial relationship the distrust the hostility even the law of Commandments contained in ordinances for to in order to make it himself of Twain of the two one new man and so making peace well what is this middle wall of partition that's mentioned in verse 14. Paul is using a physical barrier to illustrate this there there was a wall of separation between Jew and Gentile in the temple in the second temple period the time in which Paul lived and wrote there was a stone barrier or wall that separated the Sanctified space for only Jews who were purified could enter outside of that wall was the the profane space where anyone could be Gentiles included we we see this uh illustration of somebody's conception of what the temple and that wall and that Temple Mount might have looked like so this image is illustrating that wall but again it's not necessarily how it looked we don't know how it looked it was all destroyed in 80 70 and so were all the people that were taking selfies in front of it so we don't have any of those images this image however is from a stone wall that was part of that middle Wall of Separation it was likely near a gator entry point where one could move from the profane to the Sanctified space that's a little hard to read um let's see if this helps is that better uh not so much okay well the inscription for for those of you who are somewhat challenged and classical Greek it it says No Stranger is to enter within the balustrade the wall round the temple and enclosure whoever is caught will be himself responsible for his ensuing death you cross this line you die not exactly a welcome mat but the blood of Christ not only breaks down that figurative wall between Jew and Gentile that breaks down the wall that separates us well let's talk about some of these scriptures we've read see what common thread there might be among them if we find such a thread maybe we can apply it to our lives and be more like Jesus tonight tomorrow the next day first we read about Elijah and Elisha Elisha knew Elijah's time was up his ministry was coming to a close as they journey to Elijah's departure gate if you will others along the way told Elisha that Elijah was leaving Elisha told them I know hold your peace this is not news Elijah kept telling him to stay here or stay there but Elisha was too stubborn he declared he would not leave Elijah's aside you're stuck with me well after Crossing Jordan and closing in on his final moments Elijah find the AST Elijah well what is it you want and Elisha replied he wanted a double portion he wanted to continue the ministry of the Prophet after Elijah had left the scene Elijah said that's a tough one but if you see me if you see me go okay if not no and I'm sure Elijah said if you think I was sticking close to you before watch me now Elisha did see the event and he cried out it was a terrible loss he mourned Elijah's departure but brother Watkins on Sunday morning made I think was a very important observation that Elisha not only had to see Elijah leave but he had to accept that Elijah had left let's pick up the story where we left off see what happened verse 12 we read this before and Elisha saw Elijah being carried away and he cried my father my father The Chariot of Israel the horsemen thereof and Elisha saw Elijah no more Elisha took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces a sign of Anguish mourning over the loss of a loved one or a dear friend but that didn't end it he didn't stop stock he didn't have a pity party wallowing self-pity or despair he took up also the mantle that's the cloak the coat the outer garment kind of like a I guess sarapis or sleeveless kind of like a sleeveless Sarape that Elijah that fell from him and he went back he got up from his anguish and his Mourning and he returned and stood by the bank of Jordan and Elisha took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smoke the waters just as he'd seen Elijah do and said where is the god of Elijah and we're told when Elisha had also Smit in the waters they parted hither and thither and Elisha went over just as he expected to he believed the promise he believed the word spoken to him by the prophet of his time he'd made a request and he knew he had fulfilled his portion of the requirement contained in the answer so he became not an imitation Elijah but an imitator of Elijah did exactly what Elijah had done last time that I spoke I talked about not being an imitation Jesus but an imitator of Christ so Elisha came to the Jordan I took that cloak of Elijah he had retrieved when Elijah was taken from the scene and he exercised his faith he struck the surface of the water he expected the same result and he got the same result he didn't get a wet cloak that he had to now go squeeze out and put on a cactus somewhere to dry no he got a dry path through the midst of the waters across back to the world in which he lived the place he was called of God to be and his life became an extension of the same testimony the same power the same anointing the same witness that the Prophet Elijah had now right after this when he gets to Jericho we're told that they pestered had been pestered and they wanted to send out a search party well maybe he fell out of that Whirlwind and he stuck on a rock somewhere we got to go find him he might be hurt so they sent out the search party for three days they went looking for an injured or dead Elijah no they came back empty Hampton they had a hard time accepting what Elisha do the prophet was taken and it was time to move on the same Ministry but greater this double portion Jesus said Greater Works than these shall you do because I go to my father now we know one example of that is greater in number right but brother Paul Dirksen pointed out that because our times are after the cross after the resurrection after the Ascension when the blood of the atonement would be sprinkled on the Heavenly altar that that the way he expressed it we can impart eternal life that sounds a little strange bear with me it's not by waving a magic wand and saying some sort of incantation in the name of Jesus but by using the keys to the kingdom the same way that Peter did at Pentecost which all whoever sends you retained or retained whoever sins you remit they're remitted but it's not by going to a priest and lighting a candle and doing some penance no this is how Peter did it in Acts 2 38. he said the promise they were asking them what's going on so he's talking about the infilling of the spirit is prophesied by Joel that promises to you it's to your children it's to them that will come later here's how repent you have something to do repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins whose sins you remit they're remitted and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit like Elisha we have to recognize our Elijah's left the scene pick up the mantle I'm not talking about an eighth day messenger I'm not talking about a replacement Prophet I'm not talking about that he dropped it to us and we have to pick it up and carry on it's not some sort of a return Ministry but the ministry of the Holy Spirit through the bride the body of Christ if Jesus is Alive and doing then he is alive and doing Know Who You Are step into the role the anointing from God and our Modern English pick up not the cloak not the mantle but pick up the ball run with it stop living below our privileges in Christ while while stop living below your privileges in Christ there's something else in all of this that I read to you this evening I I wanted you to see these promises these admonitions are not just to each of us individually they are but they apply to us collectively we saw that in the case of Israel God spoke to Moses a person singular to deliver his message of that hour to his chosen people plural it was then up to that nation that group of individuals to carry out that message it was delivered to them they individually had to perform each part so the group as a whole could fulfill their calling Moses didn't enter The Promise Land with him he saw it he described it brother Branham told us about what we call the Rapture the catching away the return he warned us to not miss it he wanted to be a part of it alive at the return of the Lord for his chosen he told us it's so very close but his body lies in the dust of the Earth as for almost 60 years and the message brother Watkins brought us he showed us that brother Branham told those here in Tucson at that time to attend the Tabernacle it was the only message church at that time to lendeth their support to gather together to worship it was the only what we now call Message Church here at that time this church was established 57 years ago this week I first attended it 56 years ago two weeks from now brother green founded this church she's been gone for seven years we have like Elisha we have to move on I'm reminded of the title of a message brother Branham brought what shall I do with Jesus called Christ shortly after this was towards the end of his ministry he brought it again with the revised title what shall we do with this Jesus called Christ the text being from Matthew 27 when pilate was appealing to the crowd Brother Brad has subtitled it Jesus on our hands I'm not saying that we should move on from the message not at all please don't misunderstand I'm saying we need to move on with the message be what we're called to be manifest Jesus Christ who are lost and Dying World spread the good news while Mercy is still available just like Elisha moved on with a the anointing the spirit the life that was in Elijah the Bride of Jesus Christ the called out must move on with the same Holy Spirit Supernatural anointing that was brought to us by God through the messenger to our age just as Israel had to move on with the word that Moses fought when Noah entered the Ark the rain had not yet started but it was too late to enter when the coming storm was apparent to everyone the door by then had been sealed shut I wonder how Noah must have felt rain coming down people frightened scared screaming running around the ark pounding on the door let me in I can't trying to as the water level Rose trying to climb up the side drowning they wouldn't listen they wouldn't listen you know something else we can't make it on our own one separated from the other Paul wrote that the blood of Jesus breaks down the wall of separation in the world of churches at large denominational walls exist those who also really just disagreements on interpretation of some scripture or doctrine I'm afraid that in this message there are many denominations walls separation over some interpretation of the Bible or some quote or just finding fault in others what Jesus called the moat and the beam in the eyes I was so glad when brother Aaron canceled the Sunday evening surface for the purpose of us all going to worship and fellowship with our sister Church Shalom Tabernacle it's vital I believe that we realize that we it's not only we as a congregation that are in this thing together but we're also in the body of Christ together with our sister churches brother Watkins read some excerpts from what house would you build me which brother Branham spoke at Tucson Tabernacle the Second Sunday it was in existence November 21 1965. as I was seeking the Lord preparing the Lord what is it that you want for Wednesday I read that message yesterday afternoon and some parts of it struck me really hard I mean hit me over the head made me sad made me wonder which areas is liable guilty and how to correct those things I want to read a few small portions of that service some of which would be the same we heard Sunday morning I'll make a few comments as I read and I'll try to be clear where I'm commenting rather than reading what house will you build me 1965. but he meaning God the Lord is this is both of random saying but he as far as I know anything I know of God I I was sent by a vision to Tucson I've wondered how I ever was sent to this desert place and then here where there is spiritually speaking over the city he says I don't know of any place that's any more spiritual dead than in the city of Los Angeles oh no no he proclaimed judgment on Los Angeles right but no city is more dead he says than the City of Tucson Tucson why do you say that brother Branham what's the reason for this spiritual death here it comes he says there is war between the churches he says there's fusses between the congregations there's no Unity everyone grabbing and holding and squeezing and trying to get this one and prosely Lighting it's a desert spiritually speaking also wow that was amongst the Pentecostal and outer churches here 57 years ago and today how often do we have joint services or activities with other message churches in town or even non-message churches what separates us differences in interpretations of the message people who want to be in charge excuse me but I believe that this is absolute carnality I think that Satan is delighted to see that to see those walls fighting each other means we aren't fighting him he has free reign in his Eden every January the last several years we have Harmony in the desert a supreme effort spearheaded by brother Bob Wertz to Simply Fellowship and Worship the Lord gather some Churches won't even come their pastors won't come what did Brother Branham we just read it he called this lack of unity he called it War he called it a symptom of being spiritually dead it's his words it's not mine we just read them this Saturday we have a Statewide ministers meeting and there's some pastors that won't come some that never have come my question how will there ever be a rapture where we're to be caught up together to meet the Lord if we can't sit down together here on Earth let's read some more he says I'm so grateful brother Perry followed the leading of the Holy Spirit and today we have a tabernacle it's a small one that's just good enough to start with to see what the Holy Spirit not knowing let's just move step by step now I believe if God has spoken to brother and sister green to come here and has opened a place where our children and instead of on Sunday morning riding their bicycles on the streets and running around they have a place to come to worship instead of us sitting around and listening to something we've heard on radio which is all right that was 1965. there was no church to Fellowship in brother Branham wasn't welcome No Place To Worship together as as believers so wind up listening to some service on the radio Radio preaching was for those who had no church those who had no other option fast forward this is now 2022. now we decided we don't like this preacher or that brother or that sister they offended us it's something that hurt we don't like the music whatever so people sit at home surf the web scream from this church and that church streaming my opinion is for those who perhaps due to distance or age or disability or some other impediment cannot physically come to the surface and this is just for the while I think that if you're physically able you need to come to church if not this one find one and worship there every servant is open every service that it is open and you can you should be there if you don't have that urgency that drive brother Branham said you can't wait for those doors to open if you don't have that then force yourself to come anyway and when you come come to the altar and don't leave it until that urgency is there if you don't you're drying up and you're depriving the local Body of Christ of that portion of his spirit that he's placed in you I know I've been there I've done that I testified to you all about that a few weeks ago when I separated myself from this body for a season I was wrong dead wrong back to brother Branham but we as this group of people we have a message for this day we we believe God has given us a message brother Branham goes on talks about brother green leaving Texas and coming to Tucson he left everything that was dear to him also to come to the desert just to support what God has given to us now brother Branham says I say I I believe it's not only should be in our hearts it should be our duty to back him up everything that we can to attend the services to come here to worship to make this a place where God can reveal to us the things he has for us to reveal I want to read that last part again spoken in 1965 I think it applies in 2022. I believe it should not only be in our hearts it should be in our duty to back him up everything that we can to attend the services to come here to worship to make this a place where God can reveal to us the things he has for us to reveal and as his word said he's talking about what brother green said that brother green said the message doesn't come to me through the giving of the inspiration as it does to maybe some of us but he said I'm here to back up what God has given brother Brandon says what a statement and I believe if we will all cooperate together we'll put our hearts to it I know that each one of you if you feel like I do I'm so hungry to see the spirit of God moving I just can't hardly stand it cooperate together put our hearts in it some experiences I've just had up in the mountain just to feel that once again that's something when I was first Saved was So Glorious to my heart he goes on we can come into a place we can sit and see it among us if it were drying he says I begin to feel us all reclining getting away from the spirit it's become too natural a thing to us we must Worship in the spirit where the spirit of God not only our message should be the flame of the hour it should be the flame in our hearts can you hear that song burn Holy Spirit burning me set my heart on fire fill me with the Holy Ghost and God's full desire back to brother Branham see it's got to be in our hearts or we can't rightly present it to the people the spirit has to pack the message itself and he says I'm trusting and believing in every one of you to be a real Christian if the musicians would come of course I'm I'm not saying that everyone needs to come to Tucson Tabernacle I'm not saying that at all there there are other sister churches in this area but but everyone who's a real Christian needs to find a home Church just stick with it to put they all they can into it be in every service you can possibly be where the spirit can move not just when your favorite preacher is going to be there or your unfavorite you're not going to go because you really don't want that guy no or what did Brother Branham say the option was sit home try up my brothers my sisters we are in this together I cannot make it without you I can't make it without the body of Christ I just become a frozen penguin perhaps you can make it without me but Lord help me to be like Elisha you're stuck with me God is no respecter of persons and none of us not what will make it without him without him I'm just flapping my gums up here and wasting your time how will all men know you're my disciples Jesus said our love not our separating and picking and choosing which minister will come to hear and which we won't I so appreciate it that brother Israel Paul did not identify who would be speaking at the services no pre-announcements I remember in the December meeting so very many years ago brother green often did the same thing he came to hear from the Lord and trusted the leadership of the holy spirit in the ministry to provide what you needed we need to be here to hear from the Lord not to tickle our ears gather together the more so as you see the day approaching the Bible says it brother Brandon said it time and again through his ministry let's be doers not just yours let's pray together one more time Lord Jesus some of these words are hard to say and I suspect that many of the things that were said aren't for the people that are necessarily sitting here in these pews or even necessarily those that are streaming maybe it's for some who will listen or hear it later I don't know but you know Lord I just pray that something has been said tonight that for each person that's come that there's something that they can grab a hold of that they can grasp but that will be an encouragement Lord to each Heart Lord to help us grow in you closer to you closer to one another Lord that we can be seated together in Heavenly places together with you together with each other Lord be with us this week the remaining days until we gather together again Lord how our hearts should be burning just can't wait for those doors to open that we can have Fellowship again with our brothers and sisters to gather together to worship you accept our worship move by your spirit in our midst Lord answer needs in each heart help us to grow and grow and glow with the gospel Lord thank you thank you for this opportunity to be together thank you for the patience of each person that's here tonight Lord we commit ourselves to you we thank you we love you Lord Jesus amen maybe his
