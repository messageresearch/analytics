[56:26] together as one

[56:32] the beginning of a new year that the
[56:34] world recognizes we see a world in great
[56:37] stress great trauma we see War we see
[56:40] threats we see so much going on in this
[56:44] day but Lord in this day more than ever

[56:56] you to move in our midst Lord I asked
[56:58] this morning that you'd help me Lord
[57:00] this nervous vessel standing in front of
[57:02] the blood-bought congregation the ones
[57:05] that you paid such a tremendous price
[57:07] for to bring to this hour to bring to
[57:09] this moment and to bring to this day
[57:11] that the words that are spoken today
[57:13] Lord be words that honor you may be your
[57:15] words may you speak this morning and may
[57:17] we hear what you have for us we commit
[57:20] the remainder of this service entirely
[57:22] completely and totally into your hands
[57:24] and we're depending on you this morning
[57:26] Lord Jesus
[57:27] amen
[57:35] recently
[57:37] my wife Heather and I have been studying
[57:39] about the Dead Sea Scrolls
[57:41] the qumran community that wrote and
[57:44] preserved them
[57:45] it's part of the reason that I wanted to
[57:47] open this morning
[57:49] by singing a song
[57:51] I want to share with you one of my
[57:53] takeaways from that study but before we
[57:55] do that
[57:56] if we could stand in honor of the word
[58:00] I want to read two short scriptures with
[58:02] you this morning
[58:06] the first in fact both of them are from
[58:09] The Book of Revelation
[58:13] from chapters one
[58:15] and chapter 10.
[58:17] the first one will be from chapter 1
[58:20] verse 19.
[58:22] Jesus
[58:23] is speaking to the Apostle John and he's
[58:25] giving him directions
[58:28] he says write the things John which thou
[58:33] Hast seen
[58:34] the things which are
[58:37] and the things which shall be
[58:40] hereafter
[58:43] we see that John has a directive to
[58:45] write to share with posterity the
[58:47] Visions the information which he is
[58:50] about to have revealed to him by the
[58:52] Lord
[58:53] because he was faithful
[58:55] and because others over the centuries
[58:58] following were faithful to carefully
[59:00] transcribe what John first wrote
[59:02] we have this book today
[59:06] the next verse I want to read is from
[59:09] chapter 10.
[59:10] Revelation chapter 10. can you guess
[59:13] which verse I'm going to read
[59:16] not verse 7.
[59:19] not verse 8.
[59:21] let's read from verse 4.
[59:24] and when the seven Thunders
[59:26] had uttered their voices
[59:29] I that is John the Apostle I was about
[59:33] to write that's what Jesus told me to do
[59:35] to write these things I was about to
[59:38] write and I Heard a Voice from heaven
[59:41] saying unto me John
[59:43] seal up those things which the seven
[59:46] Thunders uttered
[59:48] don't even write them down
[59:51] seven funders
[59:54] powerful stuff
[59:57] I hear a question
[59:58] brother Lyle what does that have to do
[1:00:01] with qumran
[1:00:03] what does that have to do with us today
[1:00:04] in Tucson
[1:00:06] on the first day of 2023. whoever that
[1:00:09] was that ask that question thank you
[1:00:10] it's a very good question
[1:00:13] the answer is what I'm going to be
[1:00:15] sharing with you this morning please be
[1:00:17] seated
[1:00:21] notice
[1:00:24] John was about to write what the seven
[1:00:26] Thunder said
[1:00:28] he was told not to write it down in
[1:00:31] other words John knew what they were
[1:00:33] he knew what they said
[1:00:36] it wasn't mysterious to him
[1:00:39] he wasn't told to write them down and
[1:00:41] then roll it up in a scroll and seal it
[1:00:43] that it could be unveiled at some later
[1:00:45] time
[1:00:47] he was told to seal it up and keep it a
[1:00:50] secret by not even writing it down
[1:00:54] it reminds me a little bit of Abraham
[1:00:56] Lincoln
[1:00:57] somebody asked Lincoln once if he could
[1:00:59] keep a secret
[1:01:00] and his response was of course I can
[1:01:04] keep a secret it's the people I tell
[1:01:06] that can't keep the secret
[1:01:09] I think it's safe to say that the Lord
[1:01:12] trusted John
[1:01:14] to be obedient
[1:01:16] and that the Lord entrusted John
[1:01:19] with what we today might refer to as
[1:01:22] deep revelation
[1:01:27] well we know that when John had these
[1:01:30] Visions he was exiled to the island of
[1:01:32] Patmos this map here just tries to give
[1:01:34] you a bit of an idea down in the lower
[1:01:36] right you see the Mediterranean you see
[1:01:39] Greece and Italy and Egypt and Israel
[1:01:42] and Turkey to give you an idea of where
[1:01:44] all this is happening then this little
[1:01:46] red square is the big thing here you see
[1:01:49] Pat misses this island off the coast of
[1:01:51] Turkey
[1:01:52] and the other town that I've indicated
[1:01:54] is Ephesus it's only 50 or 60 miles away
[1:01:57] it's where when John completed his
[1:02:00] period of Exile and Atmos and Patmos and
[1:02:03] was allowed to return that's where he
[1:02:06] spent the last years of his life
[1:02:09] we'll get back to John
[1:02:11] when he was in Ephesus
[1:02:13] in a little while
[1:02:17] in the 20th century of our time
[1:02:20] we believe that God entrusted a man
[1:02:23] called brother William Branham with
[1:02:25] Revelations about many of the mysterious
[1:02:28] things contained
[1:02:30] from the pages of this book
[1:02:33] in fact brother Perry green started this
[1:02:35] Church Tucson Tabernacle in 1965
[1:02:38] specifically so brother Branham could
[1:02:40] have a place in Tucson to worship
[1:02:43] and to share
[1:02:45] well along with the Apostle John
[1:02:48] we'll get back to brother random in just
[1:02:50] a little bit
[1:02:52] but now let's take a look at the
[1:02:55] dedicated worshipers of the Lord who
[1:02:57] lived in a community
[1:02:59] near the Dead Sea
[1:03:01] a community called qumran
[1:03:05] this map shows the location of qumran
[1:03:08] you can see the Dead Sea and just at the
[1:03:11] North
[1:03:12] and slightly to the West you can see the
[1:03:14] settlement of qumran there's a few caves
[1:03:16] that are marked there were these Dead
[1:03:17] Sea skulls some of the caves where the
[1:03:20] Scrolls were found
[1:03:22] but
[1:03:23] qumran is located as you can see up a
[1:03:28] bit to the east of Jerusalem Jerusalem
[1:03:30] is on top of a hill here the Judean
[1:03:33] Hills elevation about 2700 feet
[1:03:37] qumran is at the bottom of the Jordan
[1:03:39] Rift Valley the lowest place on Earth
[1:03:42] that's not underwater 1300 feet below
[1:03:45] sea level
[1:03:46] there's four thousand feet of elevation
[1:03:47] difference between Jerusalem and qumran
[1:03:50] it's uh it reminds me a little bit if
[1:03:53] you've ever been to Phantom Ranch the
[1:03:55] bottom of the Grand Canyon and you look
[1:03:57] up towards Grand Canyon Village up on
[1:03:59] the rim it's not quite that much
[1:04:01] difference in elevation but it's similar
[1:04:03] to the difference of course is that if
[1:04:04] you're at Phantom Ranch and you're
[1:04:06] thirsty the Colorado River
[1:04:08] well the Colorado Creek
[1:04:10] or is is there and you might be able to
[1:04:12] find some water to drink when I was uh
[1:04:15] at the Dead Sea many years ago I stuck
[1:04:18] my finger in the Dead Sea and tasted the
[1:04:19] water
[1:04:20] I did it exactly once
[1:04:22] it's it's horrible oily salty brine
[1:04:26] I was smart enough to not do it a second
[1:04:29] time
[1:04:30] well this community in qumran
[1:04:33] it's believed to have been the same as
[1:04:35] the sect called the essenes described by
[1:04:37] Josephus he described three basic Jewish
[1:04:40] sects the essenes the Pharisees the
[1:04:44] Sadducees
[1:04:45] whether these folks were the essenes or
[1:04:48] not there were certainly a lot of
[1:04:49] parallels but we know that the people
[1:04:51] that lived in this settlement of qumran
[1:04:53] they sought to serve God
[1:04:56] the god of the Bible
[1:04:57] the god whose laws are recorded by the
[1:05:00] prophet Moses
[1:05:02] they were diligent
[1:05:03] they were zealous of the word they were
[1:05:07] deeply sincere
[1:05:09] they separated themselves from the world
[1:05:12] to the extent possible they preserved
[1:05:16] the word
[1:05:17] they gave us the oldest manuscript
[1:05:19] copies of the oldest Testament that we
[1:05:22] now have prior to finding the Dead Sea
[1:05:25] Scrolls the earliest texts that we had
[1:05:27] Hebrew texts were called the masoretic
[1:05:30] texts and the earliest of those was
[1:05:32] dated to about 900 A.D about 1100 years
[1:05:35] ago
[1:05:36] but the Dead Sea schools pushed that
[1:05:38] back to nearly 200 BC nearly 2200 years
[1:05:42] ago
[1:05:46] they were a very conservative group
[1:05:48] they were rigorously strict in their
[1:05:52] observance of the Bible as they
[1:05:53] understood it the Torah as well as their
[1:05:57] own Community rules
[1:05:58] becoming part of their Community was not
[1:06:01] easy
[1:06:02] among other things you had to give the
[1:06:04] community your wealth and live in a
[1:06:07] carefully prescribed highly regulated
[1:06:09] way
[1:06:11] there are a lot of parallels to early
[1:06:12] Christianity
[1:06:14] but they were not a Christian sect
[1:06:18] the documents recovered from the caves
[1:06:21] around qumran
[1:06:22] date back to as far as 150 to 200 BC
[1:06:27] the time of the maccabean revolt
[1:06:30] the establishment of the hasmonean
[1:06:32] dynasty the cleansing of the Jerusalem
[1:06:34] Temple the accompanying Miracle of
[1:06:36] Hanukkah was about 168 BC so they saw
[1:06:41] these miracles in their times
[1:06:45] the community was very much in existence
[1:06:47] in the times of John the Baptist and
[1:06:49] Jesus ministry much of the ministry of
[1:06:52] the Apostles after Jesus death John
[1:06:54] would have been baptizing just about
[1:06:56] where the word cave 11 is up there
[1:07:00] that they were aware of what was going
[1:07:02] on well
[1:07:05] moving on to this community the Dead Sea
[1:07:07] schools there are some 930 documents or
[1:07:11] document fragments
[1:07:13] in the collection of what we call the
[1:07:16] Dead Sea Scrolls many of them are books
[1:07:18] of the Bible there are a lot of other
[1:07:20] works in there as well
[1:07:22] some of them are quite lengthy we have a
[1:07:25] a complete copy of the book of Isaiah
[1:07:28] for example but in other cases their
[1:07:31] little scraps of parchment with only a
[1:07:34] few letters
[1:07:36] this image is something that was found
[1:07:39] only about three or four years ago as
[1:07:41] they're still sifting through caves in
[1:07:43] that area this is the most recent find
[1:07:46] and had been 60 years
[1:07:49] to the previous lines and you can see
[1:07:51] they're just little tiny scraps that
[1:07:52] have been arranged here the scale there
[1:07:54] zero to five that's centimeters that's
[1:07:56] two inches and there's several scraps
[1:07:59] there and this is a tiny fraction of one
[1:08:02] of the Minor Prophets they found scraps
[1:08:04] of nakum and Zachariah I'm not sure
[1:08:07] which
[1:08:09] this represents but this is the kind of
[1:08:12] research and work and assembling of talk
[1:08:14] about jigsaw puzzles to try and put this
[1:08:17] together and understand what's being
[1:08:18] said
[1:08:21] well the the first set of seven Scrolls
[1:08:25] were fortunately not just tiny scraps
[1:08:28] but largely complete documents were
[1:08:30] found in late 1947 the Bedouin Shepherds
[1:08:33] had found them I'm sure you're familiar
[1:08:35] with the story they sold or traded them
[1:08:37] to a felony in cando who was a Shoemaker
[1:08:40] in part-time
[1:08:42] Antiquities dealer in Bethlehem
[1:08:45] he took the seven and divide them into a
[1:08:47] group of four and a group of three
[1:08:49] the group of three
[1:08:51] was attained a great personal Risk by a
[1:08:53] man named Eliezer sukenik on behalf of
[1:08:56] the Hebrew University in Jerusalem
[1:08:59] and he obtained it as we've shared
[1:09:01] before on November 29th
[1:09:05] 1947. he was unrolling and reading that
[1:09:08] scroll for the first time
[1:09:11] in nearly two thousand years at the very
[1:09:13] moment that the U.N was voting to
[1:09:17] partition Palestine into a Jewish and
[1:09:19] Arab state to set the stage
[1:09:21] that only six months later the modern
[1:09:23] state of Israel would be born
[1:09:26] I can't imagine what he was feeling as
[1:09:28] he read these words saw that they
[1:09:30] matched up so closely with everything
[1:09:33] that he had read previously at the very
[1:09:36] moment that the vote is going on to
[1:09:39] re-establish National Israel
[1:09:44] well those three Scrolls that he
[1:09:46] obtained were a partial Isaiah scroll a
[1:09:49] collection of songs called the
[1:09:51] Thanksgiving hymns
[1:09:53] and a document
[1:09:55] called the war School
[1:10:00] the war scroll describes the ultimate
[1:10:03] battle between what they called the Sons
[1:10:06] of light
[1:10:07] and the sons of Darkness the final
[1:10:09] showdown
[1:10:10] between good and evil their equivalent
[1:10:13] of our battle of Armageddon
[1:10:19] it details the armies the strategies the
[1:10:22] weapons and so forth It's a manual
[1:10:25] for that upcoming battle
[1:10:28] unknown
[1:10:30] to Dr sukenik at that time
[1:10:33] a shock
[1:10:35] was to be in store for the readers and
[1:10:38] others who studied this document
[1:10:40] a few decades later
[1:10:43] I believe
[1:10:45] that there's a lesson in there for us as
[1:10:47] well
[1:10:49] over the centuries
[1:10:51] the Jewish people had developed a set of
[1:10:53] rules that supplemented the written law
[1:10:55] as set down in the Torah and the five
[1:10:58] books of Moses
[1:11:00] the rules are often called the oral law
[1:11:02] the the
[1:11:04] is how they refer to it a lot when I
[1:11:08] lived in Israel I was asking some of the
[1:11:10] rabbis so so what is this and and they
[1:11:13] explained it and I'll do a very poor job
[1:11:14] but let's say that you've got something
[1:11:16] very holy
[1:11:18] and you put it you put it on the altar
[1:11:21] and you build a fence around it because
[1:11:23] you don't want to get too close to it
[1:11:24] you don't want to pollute it
[1:11:26] and that fence that's the 613
[1:11:30] Commandments that are contained
[1:11:32] in the laws of Moses
[1:11:34] but you want to break that you don't
[1:11:36] want to violate that fence you don't
[1:11:37] want to break those laws
[1:11:39] so they put a second fence a little
[1:11:42] further out
[1:11:43] where they interpreted these laws and a
[1:11:46] little further they took it another step
[1:11:49] so that if you broke one of these rules
[1:11:51] you would not have broken one of the
[1:11:53] laws but you would still repent and back
[1:11:56] off
[1:11:57] this was their their Theory this was
[1:11:59] their justification this was their
[1:12:01] reason
[1:12:02] for doing this sort of thing they wanted
[1:12:04] to be so sure that they never violated
[1:12:08] this holy thing that they created a
[1:12:10] fence that was that was even further out
[1:12:15] but the focus
[1:12:17] then began to shift
[1:12:19] from the law
[1:12:21] to these rules
[1:12:24] at least so it was so for the common
[1:12:26] people they lost Focus
[1:12:28] on the laws
[1:12:31] because they became too concerned
[1:12:33] about the rules
[1:12:35] Jesus talked about this in Mark chapter
[1:12:38] 7 we read then came together unto Jesus
[1:12:42] the Pharisees and certain of the scribes
[1:12:44] which came from Jerusalem and when they
[1:12:47] saw some of Jesus disciples eat bread
[1:12:50] with defiled that is to say unwashed
[1:12:54] hands
[1:12:56] they found fault
[1:12:59] the Pharisees inscribed asked Jesus
[1:13:03] why
[1:13:04] walk not thy disciples according to the
[1:13:07] tradition of the elders
[1:13:09] but he'd read with unwashed hands
[1:13:14] and Jesus answered
[1:13:17] and said to them well has Isaiah
[1:13:20] prophesied of you hypocrites
[1:13:23] actors Pretenders
[1:13:25] as it is written this people on Earth me
[1:13:28] with their lips
[1:13:30] but their heart
[1:13:31] is far from me
[1:13:34] how be it in vain
[1:13:37] after they worship me
[1:13:40] teaching for Doctrine substituting for
[1:13:43] doctrines
[1:13:45] the Commandments
[1:13:46] of men laying aside the Commandment of
[1:13:50] God you hold the tradition of men as the
[1:13:53] washing of pots and cups and many other
[1:13:55] such-like things you do and he goes on
[1:13:57] to give them examples
[1:13:58] now Jesus is not saying you shouldn't
[1:14:01] wash your hands before you eat
[1:14:03] he's not saying that but he's saying the
[1:14:06] Traditions the rules have replaced the
[1:14:10] Commandments and words of God
[1:14:13] with the rules
[1:14:15] and words of men
[1:14:19] well these sets of rules in general are
[1:14:21] referred to as the halacha in Hebrew
[1:14:23] halach to walk to go it's it's how you
[1:14:26] go it's how you proceed in life it's
[1:14:29] that's how they attempted to apply the
[1:14:31] scriptures to the changing circumstances
[1:14:33] of their day and time as you might
[1:14:35] expect
[1:14:37] different groups of Jewish people had
[1:14:39] differing views on how to apply the law
[1:14:43] and and what the rules really were and
[1:14:46] on and on leading to various
[1:14:49] sects
[1:14:51] moving back closer to our day
[1:14:54] after Israel's war of independence in
[1:14:56] 1948 the caves around qumran were again
[1:14:59] being explored realize that this area
[1:15:02] the Dead Sea all of that was under
[1:15:04] Jordanian control
[1:15:06] it didn't come under Israeli control
[1:15:08] until after the Six Day War of 1967.
[1:15:13] well the nearby caves were numbered
[1:15:15] they'd go into a cave near the
[1:15:17] settlement and if they found anything
[1:15:19] they would okay we just did cave one we
[1:15:22] found something here this is cave too if
[1:15:24] the cave was empty it didn't get a
[1:15:25] number
[1:15:26] and they would then carefully sift
[1:15:29] through things find all these fragments
[1:15:31] as you saw that slide earlier worked
[1:15:33] their way through that and then
[1:15:36] examine another cave
[1:15:38] and another cave
[1:15:42] in K4
[1:15:44] they found literally hundreds
[1:15:47] of school fragments
[1:15:50] one of these is known among scholarly
[1:15:53] circles is 4q mmt well the four just
[1:15:57] means it came from K4 anything from cave
[1:16:00] one is one the queue is for qumran
[1:16:02] that's where these caves are located
[1:16:05] the mmt
[1:16:07] is is from a Hebrew phrase which I will
[1:16:10] not attempt to pronounce but it means
[1:16:12] some precepts of the Torah or some
[1:16:15] rulings pertaining to the Torah this
[1:16:19] this document this 4q mmt is pieced
[1:16:24] together from several fragments from
[1:16:26] fragments 394 through 399 that were
[1:16:29] found in that cave as I say there were
[1:16:31] hundreds of fragments
[1:16:33] this document is 4q mmt is often
[1:16:36] referred to as the halachic letter don't
[1:16:40] worry there won't be a test
[1:16:42] these fragments were recovered
[1:16:45] between 1953
[1:16:48] and 1959
[1:16:50] the composition of this letter
[1:16:54] is dated to about 150 BC
[1:16:58] the text however wasn't released
[1:17:02] until 1994.
[1:17:05] after some 40 years
[1:17:07] of research and investigation
[1:17:13] this document 4q mmt is unique because
[1:17:16] it's the only letter that we found it
[1:17:19] wasn't a transcription of a book or a
[1:17:21] manual it was a letter written from this
[1:17:24] community
[1:17:26] as such
[1:17:28] it gives us a significant view some
[1:17:31] insight
[1:17:32] into the qumran community and how they
[1:17:35] viewed
[1:17:36] certain interpretations
[1:17:39] of the Torah
[1:17:41] in it there are 20 points of
[1:17:43] interpretation of Jewish law and
[1:17:45] practice that are detailed
[1:17:47] the letter appears to be from the qumran
[1:17:50] sex teacher of righteousness that their
[1:17:52] guy okay so it says well we see this but
[1:17:56] you do that it's written to the
[1:17:59] Sadducees apparently and and and they do
[1:18:02] this other well they are the Pharisees
[1:18:07] let me show you just one of the points
[1:18:11] imagine you have a vessel
[1:18:14] in this case I'm just showing a bowl
[1:18:16] with water in a cup but but let's say
[1:18:19] that it's that it's a large
[1:18:22] Pottery vessel or brass vessel or
[1:18:24] something containing holy oil for the
[1:18:26] menorah
[1:18:27] okay well you can't lift this really big
[1:18:30] jug of stuff
[1:18:32] to hold it up to the lamp to fill it so
[1:18:34] you pour it from this big jug into this
[1:18:38] smaller container
[1:18:40] so you can then take that smaller
[1:18:41] container and put the oil in the menorah
[1:18:45] so you can light the lamps
[1:18:51] so this larger vessel contains a liquid
[1:18:55] something that is ritually pure this
[1:18:58] vessel this large bowl that's being
[1:18:59] poured from also is richly pure
[1:19:05] so you're pour it into this lower vessel
[1:19:08] and then oops
[1:19:10] you discovered that that lower vessel
[1:19:14] it's unclean it's not richly pure
[1:19:18] somebody made a mistake
[1:19:22] so here's the question
[1:19:24] does the clean liquid purify the unclean
[1:19:27] vessel
[1:19:29] or does the unclean vessel
[1:19:32] cause the liquid within it
[1:19:34] to be impure
[1:19:37] and more and beyond that what about that
[1:19:41] stream that's flowing from the upper
[1:19:43] vessel to the lower is that stream Pure
[1:19:47] or is it now impure and what about all
[1:19:50] the contents of that upper vessel are is
[1:19:53] that all now contaminated and has to be
[1:19:55] discarded and what about that vessel
[1:19:58] itself that upper vessel is it now
[1:20:00] unclean as well
[1:20:03] foreign
[1:20:04] the Pharisees and Sadducees in this
[1:20:07] particular case held that well the lower
[1:20:09] vessel was unclean and the stuff that's
[1:20:11] entered unclean and you've got to go
[1:20:12] through whatever the levitical law says
[1:20:14] that you do depending upon What that
[1:20:16] particular stuff happens to be
[1:20:18] but that the main vessel and the liquid
[1:20:20] that's in it is is still fine
[1:20:24] no the essene said no qumran they said
[1:20:28] the whole it's all unclean you've got to
[1:20:30] get rid of all of it you've got to start
[1:20:32] over from scratch
[1:20:35] we look at that and we say
[1:20:38] really
[1:20:40] this
[1:20:41] was a point that was so important to
[1:20:44] them that they were willing to break
[1:20:46] Fellowship they were willing to set up a
[1:20:48] community by the Dead Sea and not even
[1:20:49] go to Jerusalem because Jerusalem was
[1:20:53] polluted the temple was polluted and
[1:20:56] they would have nothing to do with that
[1:20:59] but the release of this letter
[1:21:03] sent shock waves
[1:21:05] through some circles within Judaism
[1:21:09] prior to this
[1:21:11] it was believed that the various sects
[1:21:13] within Judaism the essenes the Sadducees
[1:21:16] the Pharisees and the second temporal
[1:21:18] time were separated over doctrinal
[1:21:20] issues is there life after death we know
[1:21:23] of Jesus discussion with the Sadducees
[1:21:25] about that
[1:21:27] this letter made it clear that the
[1:21:30] separations weren't based on major
[1:21:31] issues of Doctrine but slight
[1:21:34] differences of interpretation of issues
[1:21:38] that The Outsiders at least are trivial
[1:21:42] they just don't matter what are you
[1:21:44] making a big deal about this for
[1:21:48] but what was the real
[1:21:50] shocker
[1:21:56] when they looked at the phrases how the
[1:21:59] wording was done in this and the wording
[1:22:01] in other documents it became clear that
[1:22:04] in that war scroll that Dr sukenik had
[1:22:07] been reading on November 29 1947.
[1:22:11] the sons of Light it's not the followers
[1:22:15] of the Torah versus the atheists and the
[1:22:18] Romans in the World At Large
[1:22:20] the sons of Light were the qumran
[1:22:23] community
[1:22:25] the evil the sons of Darkness were the
[1:22:29] Pharisees and the Sadducees and the
[1:22:31] other Jewish Believers that didn't see
[1:22:34] it quite the way they saw it
[1:22:40] oh my
[1:22:42] they all believed the same message
[1:22:45] from Moses
[1:22:46] but they interpreted it
[1:22:48] differently
[1:22:50] Jesus said
[1:22:52] Jerusalem
[1:22:54] Jerusalem
[1:22:56] which kills the prophets which Stones
[1:23:00] those that are sent to thee
[1:23:02] how often I would have gathered thy
[1:23:06] children together
[1:23:09] as a hen gathers her throat under her
[1:23:12] wings
[1:23:13] but you would not Jesus is saying this
[1:23:18] at the time of the qumran community is
[1:23:20] there and the Pharisees and the
[1:23:22] Sadducees you would not eat sect
[1:23:27] thought they were right
[1:23:29] and the others were wrong they
[1:23:31] interpreted the message of their day a
[1:23:33] little differently than the other guy
[1:23:35] to the point
[1:23:37] they had little
[1:23:38] or no
[1:23:39] Fellowship
[1:23:41] they refused
[1:23:43] to be gathered together
[1:23:46] they were so busy squabbling and
[1:23:49] separating and so focused on being right
[1:23:53] that they missed the coming of the Lord
[1:23:59] I'm sorry brothers and sisters when I
[1:24:02] read that and I read this and I thought
[1:24:03] Lord where are we today
[1:24:05] we're looking for a Rapture we're
[1:24:07] looking for the coming of the Lord and
[1:24:08] if we can't even gather together if we
[1:24:10] can't get past our differences
[1:24:13] what are we going to miss
[1:24:16] what are we gonna miss he said look for
[1:24:18] this reason the fact that you refuse if
[1:24:21] you get along and gathered together with
[1:24:23] me your house is Left To You desolate
[1:24:27] verily I say to you ye shall not see me
[1:24:31] until that kind come when you say
[1:24:33] blessed is he that comes in the name
[1:24:38] of the Lord
[1:24:40] we see with their deep Revelation led to
[1:24:44] with the qumran community
[1:24:46] spiritual arrogance
[1:24:49] separation from fellowship
[1:24:51] and eventually
[1:24:53] desolation
[1:24:55] they went through the tribulation of
[1:24:57] their day the Roman Conquest the
[1:24:59] destructions
[1:25:01] I'm sure you see the parallels and the
[1:25:04] dangers to us today we we talk about a
[1:25:06] rapture
[1:25:07] my brothers and sisters until we can sit
[1:25:10] down together till we can be gathered
[1:25:12] together here on planet Earth and Tucson
[1:25:14] or Jeffersonville or wherever as
[1:25:17] brothers and sisters in spite of
[1:25:20] differing viewpoints and perspectives
[1:25:23] and interpretations that are oh so right
[1:25:27] we're not going to be caught away
[1:25:29] together
[1:25:31] if you can't stand Toe to Toe and
[1:25:34] bitterly disagree and still love each
[1:25:35] other
[1:25:36] look who had more Revelation than Jesus
[1:25:39] Christ himself
[1:25:41] look what he said to the twelve as they
[1:25:44] prepared to walk from Jerusalem to
[1:25:46] Gethsemane his very last moments
[1:25:48] together with these precious disciples
[1:25:50] that he invested three years of his life
[1:25:53] into
[1:25:54] he's pouring out his heart to them and
[1:25:56] what does he say to them John 13 33
[1:25:59] little children
[1:26:01] yet a little while
[1:26:03] and I'm with you you don't know but in a
[1:26:06] few hours I'm going to be taken I'm
[1:26:08] believing so much sooner than you think
[1:26:11] and you're going to seek
[1:26:13] me and as I said to the Jews where I go
[1:26:16] you can't come
[1:26:18] I say the same to you
[1:26:21] you can't come where I'm going however a
[1:26:24] new commandment I give you
[1:26:28] a new commandment here it is
[1:26:30] going to tell us the secret of the
[1:26:32] Rapture the moment we've been waiting
[1:26:34] for we're listening Lord what is this
[1:26:37] new commandment
[1:26:39] love one another
[1:26:41] as I've loved you that you also love one
[1:26:45] another
[1:26:47] what
[1:26:49] that's it
[1:26:51] by this
[1:26:53] by this
[1:26:55] shall all men know you're my disciples
[1:26:57] not because you have great Revelation if
[1:27:01] you have love one to another
[1:27:05] not some deep revelation of some Arcane
[1:27:08] or obscure mystery not recitations not
[1:27:11] quotes but love expressed in sacrificial
[1:27:16] office
[1:27:18] later that same evening that last
[1:27:21] evening
[1:27:22] John 15 as the father hath loved me so
[1:27:28] have I loved you
[1:27:31] continue
[1:27:33] in my love
[1:27:35] if you keep my Commandments
[1:27:38] you shall abide in my love you'll dwell
[1:27:40] in my love you'll live in my love even
[1:27:43] as I kept my father's Commandments and
[1:27:47] abide in his love
[1:27:51] these things have I spoken unto you
[1:27:54] that my joy my my children was my comedy
[1:27:57] light my my exceeding gladness might
[1:28:00] remain in you
[1:28:01] and that your joy might be full this is
[1:28:06] my commandment
[1:28:08] here it comes
[1:28:10] how to abide in his love
[1:28:13] that you love one another as I have
[1:28:16] loved you
[1:28:19] greater love hath no man than this that
[1:28:21] a man lay down his life for his friends
[1:28:23] you're my friends if
[1:28:27] you do whatsoever I command you
[1:28:31] what the oh what is the Commandment go
[1:28:34] back to verse 12.
[1:28:36] Jesus is telling them his sacrifices for
[1:28:39] his friends is an expression of his love
[1:28:42] but that it loses its meaning if they
[1:28:45] don't possess that Same Love
[1:28:49] pretty plain in his final hours with his
[1:28:53] disciples he's repeating this theme over
[1:28:55] and over
[1:28:57] not talking about Mysteries deep
[1:29:00] Revelations about being right
[1:29:03] but practical hands on faith that will
[1:29:07] be observed by The World At Large
[1:29:11] we read earlier from revelation
[1:29:14] the Apostle John who had been entrusted
[1:29:16] with the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:29:21] ended his days
[1:29:23] with one message
[1:29:26] for all of us and it wasn't about
[1:29:27] Mysteries
[1:29:29] it wasn't about obscure or esoteric
[1:29:32] things
[1:29:33] after returning from Patmos and living
[1:29:35] among the Believers at Ephesus John
[1:29:37] wrote First John 3 11. this is the
[1:29:40] message that you heard from the
[1:29:42] beginning
[1:29:43] that we should love one another
[1:29:46] did he change this theme well let's look
[1:29:49] at his next letter second John 1 4. I
[1:29:52] John Rejoice greatly that I found of thy
[1:29:56] children Walking In Truth as we received
[1:29:58] a commandment from the father
[1:30:00] and now I beseech thee lady not as
[1:30:04] though I wrote a new commandment unto
[1:30:06] thee but that which we had from the
[1:30:08] beginning that we love
[1:30:11] one another I think brother Branham
[1:30:13] Illustrated it in his last time they
[1:30:15] would prop John up and he'd get behind
[1:30:18] that thing he could barely stand up he
[1:30:20] was so old and he'd say
[1:30:23] look one another
[1:30:25] love
[1:30:26] one another
[1:30:29] the Apostle Paul
[1:30:31] he told us that he had physical ailments
[1:30:34] to keep him humble after the amazing
[1:30:36] Revelations that God shared with him
[1:30:40] look what he wrote to the Corinthian
[1:30:42] Church would just read one verse First
[1:30:44] Corinthians 13 verse 2.
[1:30:47] he says and though I Paul have the gift
[1:30:50] of Prophecy
[1:30:52] and though I Paul understand
[1:30:56] all mystery
[1:30:59] Mr and though I Paul have all knowledge
[1:31:03] and though I Paul have all Faith so I
[1:31:07] could remove mountains
[1:31:09] and I Paul have not loved
[1:31:13] I
[1:31:15] Paul
[1:31:16] and nothing
[1:31:18] I'm worthless
[1:31:20] I'm useless
[1:31:22] I have no value
[1:31:27] in recent times I I used to say in our
[1:31:29] day but for many of you 1965 was before
[1:31:33] you were born
[1:31:35] so I'll say in recent times
[1:31:37] brother Branham whose teachings we claim
[1:31:40] to follow
[1:31:41] told us over and over again
[1:31:44] to love one another
[1:31:47] say nice things about each other I'm
[1:31:51] reminded of a testimony we recently
[1:31:53] heard about a statement by Brother Billy
[1:31:55] paulbrand and brother branham's oldest
[1:31:57] child
[1:31:58] that he personally could not tell who
[1:32:00] his father's friends were and who his
[1:32:02] enemies were by the way that he treated
[1:32:04] them
[1:32:05] when asked about the greatest the most
[1:32:09] important the foremost commandment
[1:32:13] Jesus said Mark 12 he answered the first
[1:32:17] of all the Commandments
[1:32:20] is here listen up Israel the Lord our
[1:32:24] God
[1:32:25] is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord
[1:32:29] thy God with all thy heart with all thy
[1:32:32] soul with all thy mind with all thy
[1:32:33] strength
[1:32:34] Jesus says this
[1:32:37] is the first commandment it is from
[1:32:40] Deuteronomy 6 Verses 4 and 5 to 10
[1:32:42] commandments from Deuteronomy 5 this
[1:32:44] isn't even part of the ten The Ten
[1:32:46] Commandments are subservient to this
[1:32:49] and he goes on he wasn't asked but he
[1:32:51] went on he says the second it's like
[1:32:55] namely this that was a Love by neighbor
[1:32:58] is thyself this is part of Leviticus 19
[1:33:00] 18. again it's not even part of the Ten
[1:33:02] Commandments
[1:33:03] but the Ten Commandments are subservient
[1:33:06] to this
[1:33:08] Jesus goes on he says there's no other
[1:33:11] commandment
[1:33:13] there's no other command
[1:33:15] ment greater
[1:33:17] than these
[1:33:18] no other
[1:33:22] Matthew's accounted the same event
[1:33:24] includes one more detail I think it's a
[1:33:26] very important detail
[1:33:28] Matthew 22 he says the second is like
[1:33:30] unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[1:33:32] thyself and he says on these two
[1:33:36] Commandments hang all the law
[1:33:41] and
[1:33:43] prophets
[1:33:44] now this was written way before the
[1:33:47] prophets uttered a word a prophet's
[1:33:50] subsequent to Moses Isaiah Jeremiah
[1:33:53] Ezekiel Malachi John the Baptist brother
[1:33:57] Branham and all
[1:34:01] hangs on these two
[1:34:04] all
[1:34:09] if all the subsequent prophets revealed
[1:34:11] hang on these
[1:34:13] then there's no greater Revelation to be
[1:34:15] had
[1:34:16] been the truth of these two statements
[1:34:20] Jesus Illustrated who is my neighbor
[1:34:23] with a story that we call the Good
[1:34:25] Samaritan
[1:34:26] caring for those who were outside you
[1:34:30] you Circle Samaritans and Jews despised
[1:34:32] each other they had segregation they did
[1:34:34] not get along
[1:34:36] so Jesus talking to a Jewish audience
[1:34:39] uses an illustration of a spies
[1:34:42] Samaritan being a better neighbor than
[1:34:45] they were to their own
[1:34:48] genre of Revelations
[1:34:51] what are the words of his Epistles
[1:34:54] love one another
[1:34:56] brother branham's older son said he
[1:34:58] could not tell by his behavior
[1:35:00] who were his dad's friends and who were
[1:35:03] his enemies
[1:35:04] I want to conclude this short message
[1:35:07] with two brief statements from a sermon
[1:35:10] brother Branham preached in May 1960.
[1:35:13] is called the rejected King
[1:35:16] in this sermon he had related an
[1:35:18] experience which he called beyond the
[1:35:20] curtain of time I think most of you
[1:35:22] perhaps all of you are familiar with
[1:35:24] this
[1:35:27] he says I Heard a Voice then that spoke
[1:35:31] to me that was in the room said
[1:35:33] this is what you preached was the Holy
[1:35:37] Ghost
[1:35:38] this
[1:35:39] is perfect love
[1:35:41] nothing can enter here without
[1:35:50] and the final quote that I would like to
[1:35:52] read to you this morning that the
[1:35:54] musicians could come at this time
[1:35:55] brother Branham is pouring his heart out
[1:35:59] oh my precious friends
[1:36:02] my beloved my darlings of the Gospel
[1:36:05] might be God and children unto God
[1:36:06] listen to me your pastor
[1:36:09] you I wish there was some way I could
[1:36:12] explain it to you
[1:36:14] there's no words I couldn't find it it's
[1:36:16] not found anywhere but just beyond this
[1:36:19] last breath
[1:36:21] is the most glorious thing
[1:36:24] that you ever there's no way to explain
[1:36:26] it there's no way I just can't do it
[1:36:30] but whatever you do
[1:36:32] friend lay aside every thing
[1:36:39] everything else
[1:36:41] till you get
[1:36:43] perfect love get to a spot that you can
[1:36:48] love everybody
[1:36:50] every enemy
[1:36:53] everything else
[1:36:55] we're in this together
[1:36:58] regardless of the vote regardless of who
[1:37:01] takes the reins of leadership in this
[1:37:02] assembly your pastor won't get you to
[1:37:04] heaven
[1:37:05] and he won't be your judge I want to
[1:37:09] admonish each of us
[1:37:11] including myself our Revelations
[1:37:16] our immersion in the word our times of
[1:37:19] devotion our times of study our times of
[1:37:23] prayer should only lead us into a deeper
[1:37:26] relationship of love for God and love
[1:37:31] for our neighbor if it takes us anywhere
[1:37:34] else if it takes us to criticism to
[1:37:38] intolerance to feelings of smugness or
[1:37:41] superiority a sense of exclusiveness or
[1:37:44] Pride
[1:37:45] we need to step back
[1:37:48] we need to come to the altar
[1:37:51] [Music]
[1:37:53] we need to seek prayer we need to seek
[1:37:56] healing we need to seek Deliverance
[1:37:59] never arrogance
[1:38:02] never Pride
[1:38:04] never like those that qumran
[1:38:07] but love
[1:38:09] service
[1:38:11] like Jesus
[1:38:13] let's pray together one more time lord
[1:38:16] Jesus
[1:38:17] these few words
[1:38:20] Lord I pray that
[1:38:22] they would strike in our hearts because
[1:38:25] they're your words
[1:38:26] the words that you spoke they're from
[1:38:29] the pages of your Bible and that they
[1:38:31] could grow in our heart and draw us
[1:38:32] closer to you into one another preparing
[1:38:35] us for that great day that we believe is
[1:38:38] so soon Upon Us Lord we don't want to be
[1:38:41] right we want to have that love in our
[1:38:44] heart that draws us to you and draws us
[1:38:48] to each other we commit the remainder of
[1:38:51] the services vote that's going to happen
[1:38:52] this morning we commit it all to you
[1:38:55] it's in your hands and we trust you
[1:38:58] Jesus name
[1:39:00] as I believe brother Ed is coming to
[1:39:03] lead us in the voting I wonder if we
[1:39:04] could sing
[1:39:06] to be like Jesus I think that should be
[1:39:09] our desire this morning
[1:39:10] [Music]
[1:39:12] brother Ed would come at this time or
[1:39:14] whoever is going to do this now
[1:39:16] [Music]
[1:39:23] to be like
[1:39:27] Jesus
[1:39:29] [Music]
[1:39:30] on Earth
[1:39:35] foreign
[1:39:48] from Earth to Glory
[1:39:51] [Music]
[1:40:07] as we prepare to change the order of the
[1:40:10] service
[1:40:11] once again
[1:40:13] let's just sing that is that your desire
[1:40:16] to be like him
[1:40:18] I I just want to be like him I don't
[1:40:20] want to be like myself
[1:40:21] [Music]
[1:40:24] to be like
[1:40:27] Jesus
[1:40:30] to be like
[1:40:33] Jesus
[1:40:36] on
[1:40:38] [Music]
[1:40:48] Earth's
[1:40:50] Journey
[1:40:53] from Earth to Glory
[1:40:59] I only yes
[1:41:04] to be like
[1:41:09] this morning
[1:41:11] we're going to go to a vote this vote's
[1:41:14] for brother Daniel
[1:41:18] if for whatever reason
[1:41:21] brother Daniel doesn't get the majority
[1:41:23] then we will automatically pass out new
[1:41:27] ballots for brother Peter
[1:41:30] I trust that you've spent the last week
[1:41:32] the last few days seeking to face the
[1:41:35] Lord and how you're devote this isn't
[1:41:37] about us this is about what God wants
[1:41:39] for this assembly
[1:41:43] I like brother Daniel but my my vote's
[1:41:45] not for brother Daniel because I like
[1:41:48] him it's because the I feel
[1:41:52] or or brother Peter how the Lord has led
[1:41:54] me to vote so that's the way this vote
[1:41:57] should be
[1:41:59] this vote is going to be for the local
[1:42:00] assembly
[1:42:03] and on the ballot as most of you know
[1:42:06] the eligibility for voting is at least
[1:42:09] 18. you support the Tabernacle with your
[1:42:13] ties and offerings and you attend
[1:42:15] regularly whether it's here in person
[1:42:18] physically and for those that can't be
[1:42:21] here
[1:42:23] via
[1:42:25] streaming
[1:42:27] or however so we trust that you'll
[1:42:30] understand
[1:42:31] we pray that
[1:42:34] the Lord has his way so I heard a little
[1:42:37] sermon this week and brother Branham
[1:42:40] says the holy spirit will lead if you
[1:42:44] expect him to lead
[1:42:46] so let us expect God to come take
[1:42:49] control
[1:42:50] let's expect God to have his way in this
[1:42:53] vote so let's just take a couple moments
[1:42:56] and just meditate and ask the Lord once
[1:42:59] again to lead us and guide us and let's
[1:43:02] just go to prayer one more time
[1:43:06] our gracious Heavenly Father
[1:43:08] we want to approach you
[1:43:10] and just ask that you come take control
[1:43:13] Lord we expect you Lord to delete us and
[1:43:16] guide us and have your way in the
[1:43:19] remainder of this service and we pray
[1:43:21] Lord that Lord you lead each brother and
[1:43:24] sister Lord according
[1:43:26] to your will Lord and we ask that you
[1:43:29] you'd receive Glory and Honor no matter
[1:43:32] what happens Lord help us to get
[1:43:34] ourselves out of the way and let you
[1:43:36] lead and we commit this Lord into your
[1:43:39] hands in the precious name of Jesus

[2:06:21] I think we've been all praying about
[2:06:24] this week
[2:06:26] and uh going before the Lord
[2:06:29] and I must admit that I have been doing
[2:06:33] the same thing in in praying about this
[2:06:36] and
[2:06:37] putting this before God and constantly
[2:06:40] approaching his throne
[2:06:43] and
[2:06:44] I may have lost perspective
[2:06:47] of the Sunday morning message brother
[2:06:51] Lyle wonderful
[2:06:54] oh
[2:06:58] you'd my brother have truly spoken my
[2:07:01] heart
[2:07:02] thank you that was wonderful I I don't
[2:07:06] necessarily think it's
[2:07:08] proper uh very often to add to her
[2:07:13] brother's sermon when he finishes but
[2:07:16] now as acting Pastor I'd like to say
[2:07:17] something about your sermon and I want
[2:07:19] to say thank you for maybe leaving me
[2:07:21] the um the period at the end of the
[2:07:25] sentence turn in your Bibles friends
[2:07:27] quickly to
[2:07:30] first John
[2:07:33] chapter chapter 3.
[2:07:39] verse 18.
[2:07:42] [Music]
[2:07:49] [Music]
[2:07:54] my little children
[2:07:59] is the Apostle John speaking this is the
[2:08:01] one that God gave all the revelation
[2:08:05] as brother Lyle said
[2:08:08] this is the one that lived the longest
[2:08:10] of all the Apostles of all the disciples
[2:08:12] and the one that was called The Beloved
[2:08:15] disciple the one that laid his head on
[2:08:16] Jesus's bosom
[2:08:20] to conclude brother Lyle's sermon it
[2:08:22] says this my little children
[2:08:25] let us not love in Word
[2:08:27] neither in tongue
[2:08:30] but indeed
[2:08:32] and in truth
[2:08:35] friends we can say it all we want to
[2:08:40] but it comes down to each of us are we
[2:08:43] willing to do what this word says
[2:08:48] I am
[2:08:50] I'm going to do everything I can for a
[2:08:51] while to live up to that sermon that you
[2:08:54] preach this morning
[2:08:55] it blessed my heart so much
[2:08:57] it did
[2:09:00] um
[2:09:02] I also don't like to say that
[2:09:06] God told me something or
[2:09:09] um
[2:09:10] that to speak on behalf of God
[2:09:13] unless I really feel strongly about
[2:09:18] something
[2:09:19] but God gave me a scripture
[2:09:22] during service
[2:09:24] and I want to read it Matthew chapter
[2:09:25] 23.
[2:09:35] says this
[2:09:37] speaking of the ministers
[2:09:41] our lord Jesus talking these words are
[2:09:44] in red it says the scribes and the
[2:09:45] Pharisees sit in Moses's seat
[2:09:48] oh therefore whatsoever they bid You
[2:09:50] observe
[2:09:51] and not observe and do but do not after
[2:09:53] their works for they say and they do not
[2:09:57] for they bind heavy burdens and Grievous
[2:09:59] to be born and lay them on men's
[2:10:02] shoulders but they themselves will not
[2:10:04] move them with one of their fingers
[2:10:08] but all their Works they do
[2:10:11] for to be seen of men
[2:10:14] they make broad their philacories and
[2:10:16] enlarge the borders of their garments
[2:10:18] and love the uppermost rooms at Feasts
[2:10:21] and chief seats in the synagogues
[2:10:24] and the greetings
[2:10:27] in the markets
[2:10:29] and to be called of men Rabbi rabbi
[2:10:32] but be ye be not ye called rabbi
[2:10:37] for one is your master even Christ and
[2:10:41] all ye are brethren
[2:10:44] and call no man your father upon the
[2:10:46] Earth
[2:10:47] for one is your father which is in
[2:10:49] heaven
[2:10:50] neither be ye called Masters for one is
[2:10:54] your master even Christ
[2:10:56] but he that is greatest among you shall
[2:11:00] be your servant
[2:11:02] and whatsoever and whosoever shall exalt
[2:11:05] himself shall be abased and he that
[2:11:08] shall humble himself shall be exalted
[2:11:12] and God add the blessings to the reading
[2:11:14] of his word brother Matthew uh McFadden
