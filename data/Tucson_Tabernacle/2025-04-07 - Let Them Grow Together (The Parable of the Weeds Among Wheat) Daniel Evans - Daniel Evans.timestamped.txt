[0:03] Behold the man upon the
[0:07] cross. My sin upon his
[0:12] shoulders. Ashamed I hear my mocking
[0:18] voice. Call out among the
[0:23] scoffers. It was my sin that held him
[0:27] bare.
[0:29] until it was
[0:34] accomplished. His dying breath has
[0:37] brought me
[0:39] life. I know that it is
[0:43] finished. Last
[0:45] verse, I will not boast. I will not
[0:49] boast in anything.
[0:53] No gifts, no power, no
[0:57] wisdom. But I will boast in Jesus
[1:02] Christ, his death and
[1:09] resurrection. Oh, why should I gain from
[1:13] his
[1:15] reward? I cannot give an answer.
[1:22] But this I know with all my
[1:26] heart. His wounds that paid my
[1:31] [Music]

[1:56] will say, "This is the day that the Lord
[1:58] has made, and I'll rejoice cuz he has
[2:01] made me glad." Let's sing this with all
[2:03] of our
[2:05] hearts. I will enter his gates with
[2:09] thanksgiving in my heart. I will enter

[7:38] shine. It's just about home time.
[7:42] [Music]
[7:44] I can see my father standing by the
[7:50] door. This old world has been a
[7:54] wilderness and I'm ready for
[7:59] deliverance. Lord, I've never been this
[8:03] home sick
[8:05] before. There's a light. There's a light
[8:10] in the wind. Let's clap our hands.
[8:13] Tables spread in
[8:16] splendor. Someone standing by the open
[8:20] door. I can
[8:23] see I can see a crystal river. And I
[8:28] must be near
[8:31] forever. And I've never been this home
[8:35] sick
[8:38] before. I see the bright light
[8:42] shine. It's just about home
[8:46] time. I can see my father standing by

[10:04] deliverance. Lord, I've never been this
[10:08] home sick before. What a
[10:12] day. What a day that will
[10:16] be. Each saint in
[10:21] victory, walking through those gates
[10:24] forever more.
[10:29] as we greet one
[10:31] another, every sister, every brother.
[10:36] Lord, I've never been this home sick
[10:40] before. I
[10:42] see I see the bright light
[10:46] shine. It's just about home
[10:51] time. I can see my father standing by
[10:56] the door.
[10:58] This old world has been a
[11:01] wilderness. I'm ready for
[11:06] deliverance. Lord, I've never met this

[11:40] home sick
[11:44] before. Give the Lord a hand clap of
[11:46] praise this morning.
[11:50] And how about you turn around and shake
[11:52] the hands of the ones you'll be spending
[11:54] eternity with and tell them you love
[11:56] [Music]
[12:17] them. and brother Lyall and the
[12:19] brothers, if you want to come forward
[12:20] and get ready to open the service in
[12:22] prayer and bring the prayer
[12:24] [Music]
[12:31] requests. Let's sing this song. He's Got
[12:34] it all in
[12:35] control. If you have a need this
[12:37] morning, he's got it all in control.
[12:40] Sing this. He's got it
[12:42] all. He's got it all in control.
[12:52] He's got it all in
[12:58] control. He's put that
[13:03] reassurance way down in my
[13:10] soul. He's got it all in control. I put
[13:15] my life in his hands.
[13:19] I put my life in his
[13:23] [Music]
[13:26] hands. I put my life in
[13:32] his. So every
[13:34] road, every road I walk
[13:38] down, it's in his plan.
[13:45] I've put my life in his hands. My father
[13:50] knows what I
[13:52] need. My father knows what I
[14:00] need. My father knows what I need.
[14:08] Everything I go
[14:11] through, he knows what's best for me.
[14:18] My father knows what I need.
[14:25] Does your father know what you need this
[14:27] morning? My father knows what I need. I
[14:30] need a lot. What I need is more of him.
[14:33] I need less of Lyall Johnson and a lot
[14:35] more of Jesus Christ. And we're just so
[14:39] grateful that we can be gathered this
[14:41] morning, April 6th, and together
[14:45] worshiping the Lord, uniting our hearts
[14:47] in prayer. We have one prayer request
[14:49] that's been turned in and a praise.
[14:52] Sister Hope asks for prayer for her dad,
[14:54] Brother David Puit. He's very sick with
[14:58] the flu.
[15:00] and from sister Amelia a praise. Thank
[15:02] you Lord for your many blessings and
[15:05] healings. I thank the brothers and
[15:07] sisters that made it possible for me to
[15:09] get another car. May God richly bless
[15:12] each and every one of you. I love you
[15:16] all. That's where we should be. Loving
[15:19] one another, doing our best to stand
[15:21] shouldertosh shoulder, to lend support,
[15:24] to give strength where we have strength,
[15:26] and to accept help when we need help.
[15:28] We're just I'm just in awe of him this
[15:31] morning. Let's just go to the Lord in
[15:32] prayer. Lord Jesus, it is such a
[15:34] privilege. It is such an amazing
[15:37] privilege to be gathered together with
[15:39] brothers and sisters in Christ. Lord,
[15:41] those that we'll spend eternity with and
[15:43] eternity with you together. Lord, I pray
[15:46] for this service this morning, Lord,
[15:47] that you'd continue to be present with
[15:49] us, accept our worship, accept our
[15:51] praise, Lord. And Lord Jesus, I pray for
[15:54] our pastor this morning as he brings the
[15:56] word, Lord, the lesson from the
[15:57] parables, Lord, that we take it to
[15:59] heart, Lord, that it would just become a
[16:01] part of the fabric of our being, Lord,
[16:03] as we draw closer to you and find ever
[16:05] more ways to please you, to make you
[16:07] happy. It's our desire, Lord, that you
[16:09] would look down with a smile on your
[16:11] face and say, "Those are my children."
[16:14] Lord, we love you this morning. And
[16:15] again, we thank you for this privilege
[16:17] to be together. We ask that you bless
[16:19] the offering that's about to be taken,
[16:21] Lord, that it all be used in your
[16:23] service and according to your will. And
[16:25] we thank you again in Jesus name. Amen.
[16:28] God bless
[16:31] you. You can all have your
[16:34] seats. We're going to sing that little
[16:37] chorus. He became
[16:39] me so that I might become him by
[16:43] grace. Nice and slow.
[16:47] He became
[16:50] me so that I
[16:54] might become him by grace.
[17:04] He became
[17:07] me so that I
[17:11] might become him by
[17:15] grace. He took my place.
[17:21] He took my
[17:24] place so that
[17:27] I through his
[17:29] love could take
[17:36] his. Yes,
[17:38] he became
[17:41] me so that I
[17:44] might become him by grace.
[17:53] Oh, he became
[17:58] me that I
[18:01] might become him by
[18:05] [Music]
[18:08] grace. Oh,
[18:10] he became
[18:13] me so that I
[18:17] might become him by grace. Are you
[18:22] thankful
[18:24] today? Oh,
[18:26] he took my
[18:29] place so that
[18:31] I through his love could take his.
[18:41] He became
[18:44] me so that I might become him by grace.
[18:52] Let's lift our hands and sing this
[18:54] again. Oh,
[18:56] he became
[18:59] me so that I might become
[19:05] him. Grace
[19:11] He became
[19:14] me so that I might become him. By
[19:22] grace he took my place. Oh, he that
[19:27] I through his love could take his.
[19:33] [Music]
[19:36] and he became
[19:40] me so that I
[19:43] might become him by grace.
[19:51] And a similar that song reminds me of
[19:53] another song we sing. And the
[19:56] only real
[19:58] peace that I
[20:01] have, dear Lord, is in
[20:06] you. Isn't that the truth?
[20:10] The
[20:11] only real
[20:14] peace that I
[20:16] have, dear Lord, is in
[20:21] [Music]
[20:24] you. With all
[20:26] life's
[20:29] frustrations, I need you. And I know I
[20:36] do.
[20:39] Cuz the
[20:41] only real
[20:43] peace that I
[20:45] have, dear Lord, is in you. Make this a
[20:51] prayer personal to him. Tell him this
[20:53] morning, the
[20:55] only real
[20:57] peace that I
[21:00] have, dear Lord, is in you.
[21:06] [Music]
[21:08] The
[21:09] only real
[21:11] peace that I
[21:14] have, dear Lord, is in
[21:21] you. With all life's
[21:26] frustrations, I need you. And I know I
[21:33] do.
[21:36] Cuz the
[21:38] only real peace that I
[21:43] have, dear Lord, is in
[21:48] [Music]
[21:50] you. With all
[21:53] life's
[21:55] frustrations, I need
[21:58] you. I know I do.
[22:04] [Music]
[22:05] Cuz the
[22:08] only real
[22:10] peace that I
[22:13] have, dear Lord,
[22:16] is in
[22:19] [Music]
[22:21] you. How many used to have the CD or the
[22:24] tape of Sister Green that she sang that
[22:27] song on? You can hear her sing it this
[22:30] morning. You know, when you sing and you
[22:32] and you talk to the Lord, he comes
[22:35] close. If we can make that personal,
[22:38] like we're really speaking to him, like
[22:39] he's really here, cuz he really is.
[22:42] He'll come near. And that peace you need
[22:45] is right there. Would you stand with
[22:49] me? And let's sing
[22:53] Gratitude. K of F.
[22:58] All my words fall
[23:01] [Music]
[23:02] short. All my words fall
[23:07] [Music]
[23:08] short. I got nothing
[23:11] [Music]
[23:14] new. How could I
[23:17] [Music]
[23:19] express all my
[23:23] gratitude? I could sing these songs. I
[23:27] could sing these
[23:31] songs as I often
[23:35] [Music]
[23:37] do. Every song must
[23:41] [Music]
[23:43] end and you never do.
[23:50] So I throw up my hands and praise you
[23:55] again and
[23:58] again. Cuz all that I have is a
[24:06] [Music]
[24:07] hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[24:10] [Music]
[24:13] And I know it's not much, but I've
[24:16] nothing else fit for a
[24:21] king except for a heart singing
[24:25] [Music]
[24:34] hallelu. Let's sing verse one again.
[24:37] Brother
[24:38] [Music]
[24:40] Jordan, all my words fall
[24:45] short. I got nothing
[24:49] [Music]
[24:51] new. How could I
[24:56] express all my gratitude like you're
[25:00] talking to him this morning?
[25:03] I could sing these
[25:06] [Music]
[25:07] songs as I often do, but Lord
[25:13] Jesus, every song must
[25:18] end, and you never do.
[25:23] [Music]
[25:24] So I throw up my hands and praise you
[25:29] again and
[25:32] again. Cuz all that I have is a
[25:41] hallelujah.
[25:45] Hallelu. And I know it's not much. I've

[25:55] Except for a heart singing
[26:03] hallelujah.
[26:06] [Music]
[26:13] Hallelujah. I've got one
[26:18] response. I've got just one move.
[26:24] With my arms stretched
[26:28] wide, I will worship
[26:32] you. Oh, so I throw up my hands and
[26:38] praise you again and
[26:42] again. Cuz all that I have is a
[26:45] hallelujah.

[29:58] applied. Oh,

[30:19] gloryy to his
[30:26] name. There to my heart was the
[30:35] bloodied.
[30:38] Gloryy to his name.
[30:48] God is God. He's just I just feel I feel
[30:53] his presence. Maybe we should just sing
[30:55] and praise him the whole
[30:58] service. He is He's so good. He's He's
[31:04] just He's my all and all. Brothers and
[31:07] sisters, do you believe in prayer? Do
[31:10] you really believe that God hears us?
[31:13] Let's let's just invite him and come
[31:16] down and be a little bit closer to the
[31:18] audience. Just bow your
[31:21] heads. If you have a need for something
[31:25] from this service
[31:28] today, just ask the Lord and he'll give
[31:31] it to
[31:33] you. Almighty
[31:37] God. Oh Lord, you are so wonderful.
[31:42] You are the almighty God.
[31:46] And Lord, you came down in flesh and you
[31:49] thought of
[31:52] me and you took my sins upon yourself

[31:58] want to thank you every day of my life
[32:00] for doing
[32:02] that. Father, I pray that all of us here
[32:05] would see receive a blessing today. And
[32:08] Lord, that we would leave here better
[32:10] people than we came. Father, closer to
[32:15] God, more willing to serve you and for
[32:19] more Lord, more willing to have your
[32:22] spirit flow through
[32:25] us. Lord God, we love you so
[32:29] much. Father, we pray that you'd bless
[32:32] this service today. Be with us, Lord. We

[34:16] Welcome to all of our visitors. We we
[34:18] love you and we we appreciate you
[34:23] coming. Today's a good day. Brother
[34:26] Josiah mentioned um Sister Green. If if
[34:30] you're new to the church, and many of
[34:32] you are, um Sister Green is uh was the
[34:36] wife of the pastor, the founding pastor
[34:39] of this church,
[34:41] um Reverend Perry
[34:43] Green. And uh there's many that are
[34:46] here, maybe half or so that are here
[34:49] that are um from Brother Green's
[34:51] ministry and they've stayed the storms
[34:54] and and continued on. And um also want
[34:59] to mention brother Green was converted
[35:02] under another man's ministry named
[35:04] William Brham and uh you'll hear me
[35:07] mention him every once in a while. And
[35:09] he was just a great great man of God
[35:12] also. He was the one that among other
[35:16] great things he started the the revival
[35:19] the healing revival in the United States
[35:21] in the 40s and 50s and it spread around
[35:24] the world. a great man. He was um my
[35:30] grandfather became close friends with
[35:32] them and they they heard they'd heard
[35:36] him
[35:38] minister and they William Brandon was a
[35:42] very gifted man, extremely gifted
[35:45] um and gifted in letting the the Holy
[35:48] Spirit really flow through him.
[35:52] and he had this gift
[35:54] that to increase the people's faith and
[35:58] he would the Lord would would really
[36:00] speak through him and and talk about
[36:03] how talk about personal things in
[36:05] people's lives that no no one ever knew
[36:08] and my family started going and in
[36:10] hearing him and following him around the
[36:12] country as was there was revival going
[36:15] on all over the country at that time
[36:17] there
[36:18] wasn't as many movies and television and
[36:23] and sports events like we have today.
[36:26] People would go to
[36:27] revival and there's just a a much more
[36:30] godly generation. My uh my family was in
[36:33] the service and my uh my dad who was the
[36:37] oldest in the family. He um he was
[36:42] sitting in um in the audience
[36:45] and his brother Jimmy, a young man, had
[36:50] was born with crossed eyes and I think
[36:52] he was two or three years old and he was
[36:58] um my my dad was just worried about him
[37:01] and he'd seen so many healings and and
[37:04] he saw his little brother with his with
[37:06] his eyes crossed and and he was bowing
[37:09] his
[37:10] said,
[37:11] and he said, "Lord, help Jimmy's eyes.
[37:16] Lord, would you heal my brother's eyes?"
[37:19] Can you imagine an older brother seeing
[37:21] his his his little brother there that
[37:24] can't see and that that has that eye
[37:27] problem
[37:29] and he he was asking the
[37:32] Lord and this man who he had never met
[37:36] before named William
[37:39] Brandham. My dad looked up.
[37:43] Brother Brandham was looking right at
[37:44] him and he said,
[37:47] "Son," he said, "God heard your prayers
[37:50] for your brother's
[37:52] eyes." He said, "He'll be
[37:55] healed." Within within one
[37:58] day, my uncle Jimmy, my dad's brother's
[38:00] eyes straightened out. The Lord had
[38:03] healed the
[38:08] boy. The reason I'm telling the story is
[38:11] today's Brother Brham's birthday.
[38:13] April the 6th. And I uh you know, his
[38:16] his ministry has meant so much to me.
[38:18] And the last sermon that Brother
[38:21] Brandham preached before he got into a
[38:23] tragic car wreck and and died was a
[38:26] communion service and we are having
[38:28] communion tonight. So I thought I
[38:30] thought it was fitting to say a few
[38:32] words about brother Brandham. Um and uh
[38:37] and then also prepare for our communion
[38:39] service tonight where we take the uh the
[38:42] wine and the bread in honor of the Lord
[38:45] Jesus. We've been going through a
[38:47] parable series and I can't I uh every
[38:51] time I say, "Okay, well, I'll move on to
[38:53] something else." And then I just another
[38:54] parable comes to mind and I I start
[38:56] reading about it and I start praying
[38:57] about it and I say, "Oh, this is the
[38:59] best one yet." So, I just one more
[39:01] weekend and we'll stay in the parables
[39:02] and then maybe I'll move to something
[39:04] else after that. But we're back into our
[39:07] parables and Matthew chapter
[39:09] 13. And I really believe that this
[39:12] parable all of us know have heard these
[39:15] parables but when you really dig into
[39:17] them then you can apply them to your
[39:20] lives. Jesus, that was his ministry is
[39:23] telling these kind of stories. And what
[39:25] a parable is is you take something,
[39:28] Jesus takes something common that we see
[39:31] every day and he takes it and he teaches
[39:35] a lesson from it. So then every time
[39:38] that we see this thing that it will come
[39:41] back to our minds. Stephanie and I were
[39:43] out walking a couple days ago and I was
[39:47] talking about parables and the meaning
[39:49] of parables and I said like this prickly
[39:53] pair of cactus here and we were walking
[39:55] and there's landscaping
[39:57] um along the sidewalks and there was all
[40:01] these nice fat prickly pair of cactuses,
[40:04] you know, pretty purple ones and green
[40:06] ones and and they were doing really
[40:08] good. And then we go walking along and
[40:11] then we see this scraggly looking
[40:13] prickly pear that was all shriveled up
[40:15] and half of was laying on the ground and
[40:18] and I said, "You see the difference
[40:21] between these and this one? These other
[40:25] ones are getting
[40:27] water and then this one over here, this
[40:31] cactus, it's not receiving any water."
[40:34] And that's how we should be. We should
[40:36] be watered by the word all the time. or
[40:38] else we will shrivel up and we'll die.
[40:41] And we want to continue on, always being
[40:45] in the word, always reading our Bibles,
[40:49] always praying, and then that water is
[40:51] just water in those roots. And
[40:55] that cactus swells up and it's healthy.
[40:58] But I tell you what, you take the water
[41:00] out and it shrivels up to nothing.
[41:04] That's what a parable is. And that's
[41:05] what Jesus he a lot of what was going on
[41:08] in that time was farming. So many of
[41:12] Jesus's parables were about farmers
[41:15] because that people would see this every
[41:17] day. Matthew chapter
[41:20] 13 verse
[41:22] 24. Another
[41:25] parable. Put he forth unto them, saying,
[41:30] the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a
[41:32] man which sowed good seed in his field.
[41:34] So remember from previous lessons, the
[41:36] the kingdom of heaven is God ruling over
[41:39] his subjects. To have a kingdom, you got
[41:41] to have a king and you got to have
[41:42] subjects. So this kingdom of heaven, we
[41:45] see that there's there's problems in
[41:48] these parables. So it can't be just in
[41:51] heaven.
[41:53] It's still God's kingdom, but we can be
[41:56] the subject of subjects of God here on
[41:59] earth and represent him. So the kingdom
[42:01] of heaven isn't necessarily
[42:05] eternity. The kingdom of heaven is both
[42:08] up there and it's also rep God
[42:11] representing himself through us here on
[42:14] earth. So again, we're talking about a
[42:16] farmer planting crops. We learned about
[42:18] in a pre in
[42:20] previous sermons and actually in this
[42:23] same chapter, we learned about a farmer
[42:27] who planted his
[42:29] seeds on the field. And those seeds, of
[42:34] course, they fell on the on the good
[42:36] soil, but then other seeds fell on the
[42:38] sidewalk and some and those just didn't
[42:41] ever sprout up. They they they just
[42:43] withered. They they they didn't have any
[42:46] moisture. And then others um fell
[42:50] among thistles and and other bushes and
[42:53] they they they came up a little bit but
[42:55] they didn't have a chance to grow
[42:56] because they were choked out by other
[42:59] plants. And then some fell on good
[43:02] ground and those are the ones that grew
[43:05] and bore fruit. So we've we've talked
[43:07] about that parable. Now we're going to
[43:10] talk about this new one. And this
[43:13] kingdom of heaven is likened unto liken
[43:16] unto a man that swed good seed in his
[43:19] field. But when the man slept, but while
[43:22] but while men slept, the enemy came and
[43:25] swed tears among the wheat and went his
[43:29] way. So someone who doesn't like this
[43:32] farmer snuck into his field and spread
[43:35] seeds of another plant that would cause
[43:38] damage.
[43:40] It was
[43:41] vandalism is what happened. And this was
[43:44] fairly common in Jesus's time. It was so
[43:48] common that there were actually laws and
[43:51] penalties specifically for this crime of
[43:56] sewing this bad seed in other people's
[43:59] crops. I mean, it wouldn't be like us
[44:02] playing a trick on somebody. Now, it's
[44:04] actually these people's livelihood.
[44:07] And uh these tears are not edible. In
[44:09] fact, they can be
[44:10] poisonous. So there were laws against
[44:13] this. This was something
[44:15] common. But when the blade was sprung up
[44:19] and brought forth fruit, then then
[44:22] appeared the tears also. So the servants
[44:25] of the householder came and said unto
[44:27] him, "Sir, did not thou sow good seed in
[44:31] thy field, from whence then hath tears?"
[44:35] And he said unto them, "An enemy has
[44:37] done
[44:38] this." The servant said unto him, "Wilt
[44:41] thou then that we go and gather them
[44:43] up?" But he said, "Nay." He said, "No,
[44:47] lest ye gather up the tears, you'll root
[44:51] up the wheat with
[44:54] them. Let both grow together until the
[44:58] harvest." Very important part. Probably
[45:01] the most important part about this
[45:02] parable. Let both grow together until
[45:05] the harvest. And in the time of the
[45:08] harvest, I will say to the reapers,
[45:10] "Gather ye together the f first first
[45:13] the tears and bind them into bundle
[45:15] bundles and burn them, but gather the
[45:18] wheat into my barn." All right. So you
[45:23] sew this wheat, you you you sew the
[45:25] wheat, the wheat starts to grow. Then
[45:28] the the enemy comes in and he sews all
[45:31] of these bad seeds and
[45:34] then the people the workers out there,
[45:37] they see there's there's some sort of
[45:39] problem. Now, what do you think is the
[45:43] key to this part of the parable?
[45:49] Somebody, brother Aaron, what do you
[45:50] think the key to this
[45:52] is? There's a key that unlocks
[45:55] this. What do you
[45:58] think? Come on. You're a preacher. You
[46:00] got You got something.
[46:07] He's Yeah, he's teaching. Dan, what do
[46:09] you think?
[46:11] Huh? It's a parable. There's a key.
[46:15] There's a key to this. good. Yeah, he's
[46:19] he's separating the good and the bad.
[46:21] But there is a key that that I know you
[46:24] know that
[46:27] heaven is the field.
[46:31] You read forward.
[46:35] So, so yeah, that's part of it. But, but
[46:38] let me tell you, there's a
[46:41] key. Bearded
[46:44] Darnell, man. And he's like, "Do I was
[46:47] going to say that
[46:48] next?" Bearded
[46:51] Darnell. Does anybody know what it
[46:53] is? Who's this Darnell guy? No. Why does
[46:55] he have a
[46:56] beard? Okay, remember that you that's
[47:00] taking notes right now. Bearded
[47:03] Darnell. And I'm gonna we're gonna come
[47:06] back to this, but it's the key to the
[47:08] whole
[47:10] parable. Lionel's looking at me like,
[47:12] "Man, you're crazy.
[47:14] [Laughter]
[47:20] Let's keep going. I'll come back to
[47:22] that. Another parable. So Jesus tells
[47:25] three parables right now. And then he
[47:28] comes back to this first one. So let's
[47:29] move on. Let's move forward on the
[47:31] scriptures. Another parable. put he
[47:33] forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
[47:34] heaven is like a grain of mustard
[47:37] seed, which a man took and swed in his
[47:42] field, which indeed is the least of all
[47:45] the seeds. It's the smallest of all the
[47:48] seeds, but when it is grown, it is the
[47:51] greatest among the herbs, and and
[47:52] becometh a tree, so that the birds of
[47:55] the air can lodge in the branches
[47:57] thereof. So Jesus is describing faith in
[48:01] another parable as this grain of mustard
[48:03] seed. So it's just just a tiny bit of
[48:06] faith can do great things. And here he's
[48:09] saying that this mustard seed, it's the
[48:11] smallest of all the seeds that all these
[48:13] planters, all these farmers plant, but
[48:16] it has the tallest crop.
[48:20] Bean
[48:20] seeds, you uh gardeners, bean seeds are
[48:24] big, you know, and even wheat seeds are
[48:26] fairly significant, but a mustard seed
[48:29] is
[48:30] tiny. And Jesus li Jesus likens the
[48:33] kingdom of God to a mustard seed. It's
[48:37] insignificant, the seed. And how many
[48:41] people, brothers and sisters, do I hear
[48:44] people tell me, "I'm a sinner. I'm a
[48:48] nothing. I can't do anything. I'm a
[48:51] failure. What could the Lord do with
[48:55] me? You're just you're just a mustard
[48:59] seed, you know. Put some water on it.
[49:02] Plant it and you watch what happens. Mr.
[49:06] Miss mustard
[49:07] seed. It grows.
[49:11] So it's Moses when he met met the Lord
[49:15] met Jehovah at the burning
[49:17] bush. He said,"Lord, I can't talk. I
[49:21] can't
[49:24] preach." God said, "I'm the one that
[49:26] created your mouth. I'm the one that
[49:29] made you to speak." And then he sends a
[49:33] a a great
[49:34] preacher in Moses's brother Aaron to
[49:37] help him out. But it was God that was
[49:39] behind it. Moses may have been a mustard
[49:42] seed and he said, "I can't I can't do
[49:44] anything." But God said, "No, plant that
[49:46] mustard seed." And here's what Jesus is
[49:48] saying and it'll grow, but water it.
[49:53] Isaiah, one of the greatest prophets
[49:55] like Moses in the whole Bible, when he
[49:58] saw God there on the throne, he said,
[49:59] "I'm a man of unclean lips and I live
[50:01] among people of unclean lips. Who am I?"
[50:05] It was a mustard seed.
[50:08] And then he said, "Lord, sent me. Send
[50:11] me." And it
[50:14] bloomed. And that's how it starts in
[50:17] your life. The Holy Spirit is a mustard
[50:21] seed that's planted in your heart. It
[50:22] may be ever so small. And it may lay
[50:24] dormant for years. It may be tiny now,
[50:28] but let it
[50:30] grow. Water it with prayer. Water it
[50:32] with the word. Water it with church.
[50:35] water it with good fellowship and watch
[50:38] that seed grow. And Jesus, he's saying
[50:42] that this you you you get down on
[50:45] yourself, but look at the size of these
[50:47] mustard seeds. And yet look what it
[50:49] turns into. And then he goes on to
[50:52] another parable. In another parable he
[50:54] spake unto them, the kingdom of heaven
[50:56] is like unto leaven which a woman took
[50:59] leavened is yeast.
[51:02] The kingdom of heaven is like unto
[51:03] leaven, which a woman took and hid three
[51:06] measures of meal till the whole was
[51:09] leaven. So she took a little bit of
[51:12] yeast and she put it in all of this
[51:14] flour. And we always think of levan as
[51:17] being a bad
[51:18] thing. And Jesus talks in Matthew
[51:21] chapter 16, I'll spend a few minutes on
[51:24] that. Jesus talks about levan and he is
[51:28] relating it to the levven of the
[51:30] Pharisees and the Sadducees. Matthew
[51:33] chapter 16 verse 6 it says this. Then
[51:36] Jesus said unto them take heed and
[51:39] beware of the leaven of the Pharisees
[51:42] and Sadducees. So beware of this yeast
[51:46] from the from the priests that's being
[51:49] mixed into the
[51:51] bread. Verse number 11.
[51:54] How is it that you do not understand
[51:57] that I spoke it to you not concerning
[51:59] bread that you should beware of the
[52:02] leavenven of the Pharisees and the
[52:03] Sadducees? Now he's going to tell them
[52:05] what it is. Then understood they how he
[52:07] bade them not to beware of the leaven of
[52:09] bread but the
[52:11] doctrines of the Pharisees and
[52:14] Sadducees. Tell you what, you plant
[52:16] those rough doctrines and it can ruin a
[52:21] congregation. It can ruin your
[52:23] life. And what was the doctrine of the
[52:26] Pharisees and the Sadducees? I mean,
[52:28] they were the priests. They said, "We
[52:29] have Abraham to our father." They said,
[52:32] "We believe Moses." All the rules and
[52:35] interpretation of the rules and all the
[52:36] traditions of the church, all the
[52:38] doctrines that harden the people's
[52:40] hearts.
[52:41] So when the truth of the Bible was
[52:44] manifested before them in the man of
[52:47] Jesus
[52:48] Christ, that leaven of the
[52:51] Pharisees, that doctrine that was in
[52:55] them, they turned down the Lord when he
[53:01] came. Pharisees, they in the form, their
[53:04] levan was in the form of these doctrines
[53:06] and it really ruined the people.
[53:10] Brother Brandham said this in
[53:12] 1963. He said, 'All that lived, he's
[53:15] speaking of the first coming of Christ.
[53:17] He said, 'All that lived right with the
[53:18] word, but they had formed their own way
[53:20] of it, and their children had accepted
[53:23] it in such a way that the fathers had
[53:25] taught it until the fathers had taught
[53:29] it off of the real way. And they had
[53:32] made such an organization out of it till
[53:35] when the when the spirit tried to
[53:37] present the truth, they couldn't receive
[53:40] it. How true is that
[53:42] today? How true is
[53:47] that? It's the same thing today. How
[53:49] many churches have left the Bible, have
[53:52] left the teachings of Jesus Christ to
[53:55] following the teachings of a separatist
[53:58] sectarian theology?
[54:00] How many have left
[54:02] that they need to come back to Christ?
[54:06] We all need to come back to Christ. A
[54:08] brother told me that he had visited
[54:10] another
[54:11] church and he said, "Nice
[54:15] people." He said, "But man, I didn't
[54:17] understand anything that they were
[54:19] saying." I've been to the same I've been
[54:22] around. It's like, "Wow, you know, is
[54:25] this
[54:27] Christianity or is this that Levan that
[54:30] has started to mix and has started to
[54:33] turn our eyes away from Jesus to
[54:38] something else.
[54:41] If someone comes into this
[54:43] church, a
[54:46] visitor and you don't know, someone that
[54:50] reads their
[54:51] Bible, someone that that has is is
[54:54] familiar with Jesus Christ and they come
[54:57] in here and they don't understand what I
[55:00] am preaching. It's a foreign voice to
[55:03] them. It's
[55:05] strange. What does that say about us?
[55:10] What does that say about people
[55:13] who who this this leaven starts going
[55:17] out and then they leave the very
[55:20] foundations of Jesus Christ and they go
[55:23] off into something else. That's really
[55:26] what happened with these Pharisees and
[55:27] Sadducees.
[55:29] They had gone into all of these
[55:30] different doctrines getting them from
[55:32] Moses the prophet and and all of these
[55:35] different doctrines and
[55:37] then it didn't even make sense. And then
[55:39] when the very Messiah came, he was so
[55:41] far off of what their doctrines meant,
[55:43] what their doctrines said that they
[55:45] didn't recognize
[55:48] him. But this parable that Jesus tell is
[55:51] telling right
[55:52] now, Levan is not a bad
[55:55] thing.
[55:56] It's it's
[55:59] He he's talking about that that this
[56:02] leavenan is a is a good thing in this in
[56:05] this parable that that we're going to
[56:06] continue on in Matthew chapter
[56:09] 13. Brother Lyle bakes bread. How would
[56:14] you like to bake bread without
[56:17] yeast? How would you like to have a
[56:19] pancake that that doesn't have at least
[56:21] it'd be a tortilla? You
[56:24] know how how would you like to have how
[56:27] would you like to have bread or or cake?
[56:30] Sister Lonnie made this cake yesterday.
[56:32] Oh man, it was awesome. And uh for for
[56:36] the um the the gathering that we had and
[56:39] it it was good, but imagine if you
[56:41] didn't have yeast in there. It would be
[56:43] this flat terrible thing. I was, by the
[56:47] way, I was cooking burgers yesterday and
[56:50] I got behind the line. So people were
[56:54] waiting and you know I was I was like
[56:57] man heat up grill go faster and I had
[57:00] all these people around me and now I
[57:03] know what a lamb feels feels like before
[57:06] it's about to get eaten by a pack of
[57:10] wolves. I was like you know I'll I'll
[57:14] finish I
[57:16] promise. Verse number 33.
[57:20] So, and another parable he spake he unto
[57:23] them, the kingdom of heaven is like unto
[57:24] leaven which the woman took and hid
[57:26] three measures of meal to the whole was
[57:29] leaven and the whole this this leaven
[57:32] was put in for a good thing or or they
[57:35] wouldn't the the the bakers wouldn't use
[57:38] it and that's how a church is or that's
[57:40] how any group of people is. You can put
[57:44] some lev some yeast in there. You can
[57:48] put some good stuff and the whole church
[57:51] will benefit from it. Even one person,
[57:55] one or two people when they come in,
[57:56] they can bring that spirit and it really
[57:59] all of us just rejoice over it. Or the
[58:02] same thing can happen with a negative
[58:04] spirit. You can bring in negativity and
[58:08] then everyone suffers.
[58:11] We can all We're all in influence. And
[58:13] these things spake Jesus unto the
[58:16] multitude in parables. And without
[58:18] parables spake he not unto them, that it
[58:21] might be fulfilled which was spoken by
[58:24] the prophet, saying, I will open my
[58:26] mouth in
[58:27] parables. I will utter things which have
[58:30] been kept secret from the foundation of
[58:32] the world. He's referring to Psalm 78.
[58:34] Jesus fulfilled so many scriptures.
[58:38] I was talking um
[58:40] yesterday when uh when I was cooking uh
[58:44] there was a a guy I don't see him um
[58:48] named Jose that came uh he's a brother
[58:51] from Zion City Church and he was giving
[58:55] us his testimony. You were there and I
[58:58] think brother Jonathan was there also. I
[59:02] was listen brother Jonathan I think you
[59:03] were there listening to this man Jose's
[59:07] testimony and
[59:09] uh he was he said that all of these
[59:15] people he has seen they they preach all
[59:18] of these sermons about themselves or
[59:20] other things and they leave out
[59:23] Jesus. And then I asked him, I said, I
[59:26] said, "Show me any sermon or any book or
[59:29] any chapter in the entire New Testament
[59:32] that's not about that one man, Jesus
[59:35] Christ." And then he went on and he
[59:39] said, he said, "Brother," he says, he
[59:42] said, "the entire Old
[59:44] Testament is about him too."
[59:48] And the brother started he started
[59:51] giving his own testimony and he talked
[59:54] about this thing. Do you remember when
[59:55] he said generational
[59:57] curses and how he had to overcome these
[1:00:01] curses that were in his life? He said
[1:00:04] his mother was a
[1:00:06] prostitute. His
[1:00:08] dad was a drug addict. And he said
[1:00:11] that's the life that he lived. went to
[1:00:13] prison and and all all of these things
[1:00:17] and that that had happened in his life.
[1:00:21] And I was as as he was speaking, I was
[1:00:23] looking at him and I was thinking, if I
[1:00:25] would have seen him 10, 15 years ago or
[1:00:28] whatever it was and the guy has tattoos
[1:00:30] up to his chin and his wife was looks
[1:00:33] the the same way, I would have thought
[1:00:36] there's no hope for this guy.
[1:00:39] But God
[1:00:41] knew who he was.
[1:00:44] and he saved this man. And now he's an
[1:00:49] usher in the biggest church in Tucson.
[1:00:51] Yeah. He's living for the Lord and
[1:00:56] testifying of the goodness of God that
[1:01:00] was that was in him. I I was at a youth
[1:01:02] camp I don't know probably 10 15 years
[1:01:06] ago and this young man named Fernando
[1:01:09] came in from California and he
[1:01:15] uh there was just nothing to that that
[1:01:17] young
[1:01:18] man and I I'd always want to talk with
[1:01:22] him and and try to talk about the Lord
[1:01:24] and and uh I got some time with him and
[1:01:28] I said to Fernando I said uh where you
[1:01:30] from. He told me where he's from in
[1:01:31] California. And I I said, "Well, what
[1:01:32] are you here for?" And he says, "Ah,
[1:01:35] this girl in uh in the church signed me
[1:01:38] up to come." And I was like, "Okay, all
[1:01:42] right, cool." You know, you having a
[1:01:44] good time? Yeah, whatever. And then uh
[1:01:46] then he says, um I said,
[1:01:48] "So, what do you think about the Lord
[1:01:51] Jesus?" He says, "I don't know." He
[1:01:52] says, "I don't I don't know if there's
[1:01:54] really a God
[1:01:56] or you don't know. It just never really
[1:01:59] resonated with me. I was like,
[1:02:02] "Okay." And I I just kept
[1:02:05] talking and there was
[1:02:09] nothing. And it was like talking to a a
[1:02:12] a brick
[1:02:14] wall. And I went every way I could go
[1:02:17] down every road. And it was just dead
[1:02:20] end after dead end after dead end. And I
[1:02:23] was like, "Lord, this there's nothing in
[1:02:25] this kid." And in my mind, it's like,
[1:02:28] well, there's the wheat and then there's
[1:02:30] the
[1:02:31] tears. There's the good and there's the
[1:02:34] bad. And there, this kid's really a
[1:02:37] zero. There's nothing to
[1:02:39] him. So, the the camp went on. We had a
[1:02:43] very emotional service where people were
[1:02:46] coming up to the altar and and crying
[1:02:48] out to the Lord and he sat in his seat,
[1:02:51] you know, looking
[1:02:53] around. I was like, Fernando, man, come
[1:02:55] on. enter in and he's just nothing. And
[1:02:59] then another service to close the camp,
[1:03:02] same thing. Nothing at about this kid at
[1:03:07] all. And then I didn't think about him
[1:03:10] after the camp. I was just like, well,
[1:03:13] the Lord blessed a lot of the youth. A
[1:03:15] lot of them, maybe some of them he
[1:03:18] didn't. Later
[1:03:20] on, I find out Fernando goes home.
[1:03:26] cuts all of his ties with all of his
[1:03:29] drinking buddies, with all of his
[1:03:32] partying
[1:03:34] buddies, accepts the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:37] as his
[1:03:39] savior, wants to live right. He says the
[1:03:43] my surroundings I I can't I can't live I
[1:03:46] can't live like this. gets up,
[1:03:50] moves, and then now he is serving the
[1:03:53] Lord and he's got a bunch of kids and a
[1:03:55] beautiful sweet wife and and just
[1:03:58] serving God. And I would have just cut
[1:04:00] him
[1:04:01] out. But God sees through these things.
[1:04:05] He sees things that we don't see. We
[1:04:08] look at the Apostle Paul, and I can
[1:04:10] relate to him. He was He was zealous,
[1:04:13] but boy was he hard.
[1:04:16] He was he was
[1:04:18] rough. And I look at my past and how
[1:04:22] doctrinal I was. Man, you got to see it
[1:04:26] this way. You got to only hear the pure,
[1:04:30] unadulterated word of God from the
[1:04:33] messenger himself. And all the rhetoric
[1:04:35] that we've heard so much, that was me.
[1:04:37] And it was here is how you do
[1:04:39] it. And then God got a hold of me
[1:04:43] and he changed me.
[1:04:46] That's how Paul was. This man Saul of
[1:04:49] Tarsus was later, his name was later
[1:04:51] changed to Paul. He was rough. He didn't
[1:04:55] want any of this new sect of Judaism. He
[1:04:57] didn't want them saying anything. He
[1:04:59] didn't want this, he wanted this stuff
[1:05:00] to die because it was hurting Moses's
[1:05:03] commandments. So, he comes against all
[1:05:06] of them. And there he is as a young man.
[1:05:08] And they cast this servant of the Lord
[1:05:12] Jesus Christ named Stephen. They cast
[1:05:14] him out of the
[1:05:16] town. They take up stones. And here is
[1:05:19] this defenseless young man named
[1:05:23] Stephen who had accepted Jesus Christ as
[1:05:26] his
[1:05:27] savior. And these priests and evil
[1:05:32] people, they pick up these stones and
[1:05:35] there is Saul of Tarsus saying, "Do
[1:05:39] it. Do it." This is Moses's commandment
[1:05:43] for heresy. And they did
[1:05:45] it. And he watched them as they took
[1:05:48] those stones and they beat this man's
[1:05:50] head in until he
[1:05:52] died. And that zeal just started going
[1:05:55] up more and more in Saul of Tarsus. And
[1:05:58] he goes back and he says, "Okay, that's
[1:06:00] starting to spread in this town of
[1:06:02] called Damascus. I'm going to get the
[1:06:04] letters from the Sanhedrin and I'm going
[1:06:07] to go and we are going to imprison all
[1:06:10] of these so-called Christians following
[1:06:13] this false Christ. We're going to
[1:06:15] imprison them and bring them back to
[1:06:17] Jerusalem in chains and either kill them
[1:06:20] or put them into prison. So, he gets the
[1:06:22] Sanhedrin, the the the priest. They sign
[1:06:24] the paper. Here you go. Saul of Tarsus.
[1:06:27] He's on his road out to Damascus and he
[1:06:30] is
[1:06:31] breathing curses to these
[1:06:35] Christians. It's flowing from him. The
[1:06:38] hatred is just swelling. And there he
[1:06:41] goes. Can you imagine how the people
[1:06:43] sought how the people thought of this
[1:06:44] man
[1:06:46] Saul, this evil
[1:06:48] man? And we'll
[1:06:50] learn if you read in the book of Acts
[1:06:52] that they were afraid of him. And there
[1:06:55] he goes. He's He's going along and he's
[1:06:58] still just breathing these curses
[1:07:00] out. And then God had a different plan.
[1:07:04] He was a mustard seed,
[1:07:06] man. God had a different
[1:07:08] plan. This light comes down from heaven.
[1:07:11] Heaven knocks him onto his back, blinds
[1:07:16] him, and says, "Saul,
[1:07:19] Saul, why are you persecuting
[1:07:22] me?" Cries out, "Who are you, Lord?
[1:07:26] And he says, "I am Jesus who you're
[1:07:29] persecuting." Jesus
[1:07:32] was in
[1:07:33] heaven. So how could Jesus say, "You're
[1:07:36] persecuting me. If you're persecuting
[1:07:38] one of Jesus's children, you're
[1:07:40] persecuting him. If you're persecuting
[1:07:42] one of Stephanie or my children, you're
[1:07:45] persecuting
[1:07:46] me." And
[1:07:48] he changed right
[1:07:52] there. He gets up. The people that were
[1:07:55] with him lead him into the
[1:07:57] town. He's there for three days and he
[1:08:00] doesn't eat. He doesn't drink. You
[1:08:02] imagine how Saul felt. He was just
[1:08:06] killing and wanting to destroy this
[1:08:08] group of people people. And over here
[1:08:11] now he's like, "Whoa, this Jesus is
[1:08:13] right." God gives a vision to this other
[1:08:18] man. And he tells this man named
[1:08:22] Ananas he
[1:08:26] says in that same town he said he said
[1:08:29] uh go he comes to this man Ananas and
[1:08:32] says go to the street and to this man's
[1:08:35] house this certain man named Judas I
[1:08:37] believe his name was and ask for a man
[1:08:39] named Saul of
[1:08:40] Tarsus for behold he's
[1:08:43] praying wow even this evil man God was
[1:08:48] hearing
[1:08:49] his
[1:08:50] prayers and he says, "I've already
[1:08:52] showed him a vision that you're coming.
[1:08:53] Lay your hands on him and he'll receive
[1:08:54] his sight." And Ananas knew exactly who
[1:08:57] Jesus was talking about because he said,
[1:08:59] "Lord, wait a minute. This is a bad
[1:09:02] guy. Do you you know what he does,
[1:09:05] right? Talking to God. Wait, wait, wait,
[1:09:07] wait, wait, wait a minute. This is you
[1:09:10] know what he's done to all
[1:09:12] of the Lord's
[1:09:16] people and
[1:09:18] everyone who calls on the name of
[1:09:22] Jesus. This is that guy.
[1:09:26] Jesus responds to Ananas, go for Saul is
[1:09:28] my chosen vessel to take my message to
[1:09:30] the Gentiles and to kings as well as the
[1:09:34] pe the people of Israel and I will show
[1:09:36] him how much he must suffer for my
[1:09:38] name's sake. So Ananas goes to this man
[1:09:42] who we would have plucked out right
[1:09:48] there and Saul he calls him brother. He
[1:09:51] said, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who
[1:09:53] appeared to you on the road, has sent me
[1:09:55] that you might regain your sight and be
[1:09:56] filled with the Holy Spirit. And
[1:09:59] immediately what looked like scales fell
[1:10:02] off of Saul's eyes and he received his
[1:10:05] sight back." And he got up. And what do
[1:10:07] you think the first He hadn't eaten for
[1:10:08] three days or drank water. What do you
[1:10:10] think the first thing that Saul did when
[1:10:13] he got up and got his sight
[1:10:17] back? Yeah. He didn't eat. He didn't
[1:10:20] drink. He got baptized.
[1:10:25] And then after he got baptized, then he
[1:10:29] ate. What a great
[1:10:33] man. What would I have
[1:10:36] done? What would I have thought about
[1:10:38] this man Jose Hosea I met yesterday?
[1:10:40] What would I have thought of Saul of
[1:10:42] Tarsus? Same with
[1:10:44] Fernando. What would I have thought
[1:10:46] about these people? But God had
[1:10:49] something different. Now, we got to get
[1:10:50] to bearded
[1:10:52] Darnell. Who is this
[1:10:55] guy? Let's go back to um chapter
[1:10:59] 13, verse number
[1:11:02] 36 in
[1:11:06] Matthew. Yes. Then Jesus sent the
[1:11:09] multitude away and went into the house.
[1:11:12] This is after he had told them those
[1:11:14] three parables. And Jesus sent the
[1:11:16] multitude away and went into the house.
[1:11:18] And his disciples came unto him saying,
[1:11:20] "Declare unto us the parable of the
[1:11:22] tears of the field." They're like,
[1:11:23] "Yeah, we understood the mustard seed
[1:11:25] thing. We understood that one and we
[1:11:27] understood the leaven, but that that
[1:11:31] parable that you told about sewing the
[1:11:33] different kinds of seeds in the field.
[1:11:35] Can you explain that one a little bit
[1:11:38] further?" Let's go back and uh read
[1:11:41] Let's read it
[1:11:42] again. Go back to verse 24. Thank you.
[1:11:45] Another parable. put he forth to them,
[1:11:48] saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like
[1:11:49] unto a man which sowed good seed in a
[1:11:51] field." And when while the man slept,
[1:11:53] his enemy came and swed tears among the
[1:11:55] wheat and went and went his way. Then
[1:11:57] when the blade was sprung up and brought
[1:11:59] forth fruit, then appeared the tears
[1:12:02] also. So the servants of the householder
[1:12:05] came and said unto him, "Sir, does thou
[1:12:09] not sow good seed in thy field? From
[1:12:11] whence then hath it tears?" And he said
[1:12:14] unto them, "An enemy hath done this."
[1:12:17] The servant said unto him, "Wilt thou
[1:12:19] then that we go and gather them up?" And
[1:12:23] he said, "No." He said, "Lest you gather
[1:12:25] up the lest while you gather up the
[1:12:27] tears, you root up also the wheat with
[1:12:30] them. Let them both grow together until
[1:12:34] the harvest. And in the time of the
[1:12:36] harvest, I will say unto the
[1:12:38] reapers, gather ye to gather ye together
[1:12:41] the first the tears and bind them in
[1:12:43] bundles to burn them, but gather the
[1:12:46] wheat into my barn. Now skip to verse
[1:12:49] 37, brother Dan, where you were at
[1:12:51] before. Verse number 37 says this. He
[1:12:54] answered and said unto them, he that
[1:12:57] sweth the seed, the good seed, is the
[1:12:59] son of
[1:13:00] man. Jesus refer referred to him, this
[1:13:03] is very important. Jesus referred to
[1:13:04] himself usually as son of man. It means
[1:13:09] that he was basically born from the
[1:13:11] womb of a woman and he's a human
[1:13:15] being. It means that he was a man. Jesus
[1:13:19] wanted to be associated with
[1:13:21] mankind. He could have said he was a son
[1:13:23] of God. He did say he was the son of God
[1:13:25] once or twice, but he wanted to lower
[1:13:29] himself to be one of us. So he called
[1:13:32] himself son of
[1:13:35] man and he and he uh he was saying that
[1:13:39] basically I'm the guy that planted this
[1:13:41] field in the world. The field is the
[1:13:44] world. The good seed are the children of
[1:13:46] the kingdom, but the tears are the
[1:13:49] children of the wicked one. Now there's
[1:13:52] this good seed and there's the tears.
[1:13:54] What do you think the tears are? I
[1:13:56] always thought that they're like this
[1:13:57] sticker bush and if you go in and you
[1:13:59] pull out one of the weeds that you pull
[1:14:03] out the roots of the of the good plants.
[1:14:05] That's not what he's saying. That's what
[1:14:07] I've always thought my whole life that
[1:14:08] that's what it is. When I was in living
[1:14:11] in Jeffersonville, I I planted I I used
[1:14:14] to like my garden and I would plant rows
[1:14:18] and the first time I planted my garden,
[1:14:20] I planted like mustard greens and beans
[1:14:22] and kale and spinach.
[1:14:25] Well, this row right
[1:14:29] here, I watered them and in a couple
[1:14:31] days some clover started coming up. And
[1:14:36] clover is like the stuff in the grass,
[1:14:38] you know, and it it popped up and I was
[1:14:40] like, man, I started picking it
[1:14:41] out. How did the clover seed already get
[1:14:44] into my garden? All these weeds already.
[1:14:47] So, as time went on, a couple days and
[1:14:49] more and more came and I kept picking
[1:14:50] them out and picking them out. And then
[1:14:53] I noticed, wait a
[1:14:55] minute, this clover's growing in a
[1:15:01] row. I was picking my mustard
[1:15:05] greens because they looked just like
[1:15:08] clover.
[1:15:10] Bearded
[1:15:13] Darnell is exact it's it's a type of
[1:15:16] wheat and it looks exactly like wheat.
[1:15:21] If you show a
[1:15:22] picture of of what it is, on the left is
[1:15:27] wheat and on the right is
[1:15:31] Darnell. So they look almost exactly and
[1:15:33] when they're young, when they're little,
[1:15:35] you can't tell the difference at all.
[1:15:37] Even an expert can't tell the
[1:15:38] difference. So Jesus is saying that if
[1:15:41] you go and you pick it
[1:15:43] out, that you're going to pick out the
[1:15:46] good stuff, too,
[1:15:48] because you don't know. You can't tell
[1:15:50] what's good and what's bad.
[1:15:54] Remember Jose? Remember Fernando, the
[1:15:57] Apostle
[1:15:58] Paul? You don't know what's good and
[1:16:01] what's bad. So just let it grow until it
[1:16:05] matures.
[1:16:08] The field is the world. The good seed
[1:16:10] are the children of the kingdom, but the
[1:16:12] tears are the children of the wicked
[1:16:14] one.
[1:16:17] So
[1:16:19] what a as it grows, as this wheat and
[1:16:23] these tears grow, as this darnell and
[1:16:26] this wheat grow, it when it gets mature,
[1:16:31] then you are able to tell a difference.
[1:16:33] Because why? Because it's fruit that
[1:16:37] it's bearing. It bears wheat. a wheat
[1:16:41] plant will come up and bow its
[1:16:44] head full of that seed. The Darnell just
[1:16:47] shoots straight up and it it's it's
[1:16:50] sitting there right there. And even the
[1:16:52] seed is
[1:16:53] poisonous. So when this enemy of this
[1:16:56] man spread this seed, he was not only
[1:16:58] vandalizing the guy's crop, but it could
[1:17:01] have also poisoned his family. A very,
[1:17:04] very, very evil thing to do.
[1:17:07] And the enemy that swed them is the
[1:17:09] devil. The harvest is the end of the
[1:17:12] world and the reapers are the angels. So
[1:17:16] Jesus says, "You don't do it because you
[1:17:20] don't
[1:17:21] know. Leave it to the angels when they
[1:17:24] come at the end." And they're going to
[1:17:28] bind the good and they're going to bind
[1:17:31] the bad.
[1:17:34] As the tears, as therefore the tears are
[1:17:37] gathered and burned in the fire, so
[1:17:39] shall it be in the end of this world.
[1:17:41] The Son of Man shall send forth his
[1:17:43] angels, and they shall gather out of his
[1:17:45] kingdom all of the things that offend,
[1:17:47] and them which do iniquity, and shall
[1:17:50] cast them into the furnace. There shall
[1:17:52] be wailing and nashing of teeth. Then
[1:17:54] shall the righteous shine forth as a son
[1:17:57] in the kingdom of their father, who hath
[1:17:59] who hath ears to hear, let him hear. So
[1:18:03] not notice the master of the field told
[1:18:06] the workers, don't pull it up because
[1:18:09] you might pull up the good seed. And the
[1:18:11] reason he said that is not because the
[1:18:14] roots are tangled together. It's
[1:18:15] actually good when you pull a weed out
[1:18:18] of your garden. It kind of airates the
[1:18:20] soil and and loosens it up so that that
[1:18:23] plant can can dig down deeper. And that
[1:18:26] that weed is is competing for the the
[1:18:31] nutrients.
[1:18:32] It's competing for what what the the
[1:18:36] soil has and and the the Bible says that
[1:18:39] the rain falls on the just and the
[1:18:41] unjust. So, as the rain is falling on
[1:18:43] this fake wheat and this real wheat,
[1:18:46] they're both rejoicing over the presence
[1:18:48] of the Lord. They're both getting
[1:18:50] something from God. They're both growing
[1:18:53] because of this these nutrients in the
[1:18:56] soil and this rain and the sunshine. But
[1:18:58] when they mature, one has good fruit and
[1:19:02] one
[1:19:03] doesn't. One group will be burned with
[1:19:05] fire and the other group will enter into
[1:19:07] the kingdom of of
[1:19:09] God. And then Jesus makes the statement.
[1:19:12] He says, "Whosoever has
[1:19:14] ears, let him
[1:19:16] hear," which means all of us. And this
[1:19:20] parable has been read over and over and
[1:19:22] over. And Jesus saying these things like
[1:19:25] everyone should be listening to me.
[1:19:29] And as you're thinking about this
[1:19:30] parable and as we are thinking about
[1:19:32] it as we get
[1:19:34] older, are we
[1:19:37] maturing? Are we maturing in
[1:19:41] God? And the realization of who we are,
[1:19:44] is that really manifesting itself? Am I
[1:19:47] becoming more like Christ? Am I becoming
[1:19:50] more
[1:19:51] holy? Or are you becoming more like the
[1:19:53] world?
[1:19:55] Are you looking more like the world as
[1:19:56] you get as as you as you grow older? Are
[1:19:59] you acting more like the world? The
[1:20:02] wheat, brothers and sisters, the wheat
[1:20:04] didn't have a choice where it was
[1:20:06] planted. God just planted it there. He
[1:20:10] planted us
[1:20:12] here and we are maturing and the weeds
[1:20:18] are
[1:20:19] maturing. This
[1:20:21] wheat, it's a it's a parable. So, it's
[1:20:26] not he he's teaching us a lesson, but
[1:20:29] this wheat didn't have the opportunity
[1:20:33] to
[1:20:35] change. It was wheat. It was born wheat.
[1:20:38] It grew up wheat. And neither did the
[1:20:40] tear have the opportunity to change. But
[1:20:43] we do. And that's the wonderful thing
[1:20:46] about the gospel. Jesus says, "Have
[1:20:48] faith." Jesus tells us to believe. All
[1:20:50] the prophets tell us to believe. And if
[1:20:52] we are to believe, then we have a choice
[1:20:55] to make. And we choose this or we choose
[1:20:58] that. And the choices that we make
[1:21:00] really prove who we
[1:21:02] are. And there's a new
[1:21:05] birth that changes. It can change a
[1:21:09] tear into a
[1:21:12] wheat. It can change us. But I had to
[1:21:15] make the choice. You have to make the
[1:21:18] choice. Am I going to be something
[1:21:20] that's just
[1:21:22] fruitless that's going to be gathered
[1:21:24] and
[1:21:26] burned
[1:21:28] or am I going to be a wheat something
[1:21:31] that helps other people something that's
[1:21:33] a blessing to others? We have that
[1:21:36] choice. the musicians can come and we're
[1:21:42] close. A bearded Darnell that sorry I
[1:21:47] thought you'll never forget it.
[1:21:50] [Laughter]
[1:21:53] It's a
[1:21:54] um it's
[1:21:57] it's actually it's it's got a a lot to
[1:22:00] it, but it was common for people to do
[1:22:03] this back in Jesus's time. and to ruin
[1:22:07] crops. And it wasn't until
[1:22:10] recently that a combine now can separate
[1:22:14] the different seeds between wheat and
[1:22:17] this false
[1:22:18] wheat. And that's really that's how
[1:22:20] God's combines are. That it can grow up
[1:22:26] together and then let God sort it out.
[1:22:32] There's friends,
[1:22:36] there's it's not up to
[1:22:39] me to
[1:22:41] sort even as a pastor of the church. So
[1:22:43] many pastors try to do it. They say you
[1:22:46] are and you
[1:22:48] aren't. It's not up to me to sort it out
[1:22:52] because so many people would be if it
[1:22:54] was up to us, how many people would be
[1:22:56] lost and just say, "No, that person
[1:22:58] there's no hope for that person." And
[1:22:59] then that person turns out to be one of
[1:23:02] the finest Christians you've ever met.
[1:23:04] One of the most influential people in
[1:23:05] the whole Bible was the Apostle
[1:23:08] Paul. You know his name was Saul of
[1:23:12] Tarsus. Jesus called himself son of man
[1:23:15] really because he wanted to be
[1:23:17] associated with the human race. Saul of
[1:23:20] Tarsus his name was changed to Paul
[1:23:24] which is the Roman
[1:23:25] name, the gentile name.
[1:23:29] for Saul because he wanted to be
[1:23:32] associated with that group of people. He
[1:23:34] wanted to grow among them. He wanted to
[1:23:37] he loved them. And that's why his
[1:23:40] ministry was the most successful really
[1:23:42] in
[1:23:43] history is because of how much love that
[1:23:47] he had. And he didn't separate. He just
[1:23:49] let them all grow together. And boy,
[1:23:52] there was a lot of wheat in his
[1:23:54] ministry.
[1:23:57] Brothers and sisters, there's
[1:23:58] wheat in this
[1:24:02] building and there's
[1:24:05] Darnell. Every every congregation has
[1:24:10] both. And it's up to
[1:24:12] you if you want to make the choice.
[1:24:14] Lord, I want to be a wheat. I want a new
[1:24:17] birth. I want to change this person that
[1:24:20] I used to be.
[1:24:22] I want to change it
[1:24:24] into this Christian that I hear preached
[1:24:28] from the pullpit that I read in the
[1:24:30] Bible. I want to change it to that
[1:24:33] person. God already knew the decision
[1:24:35] that you were going to
[1:24:36] make. He's the one that called us and we
[1:24:41] many of us answered that call. God bless
[1:24:43] you, brother Josiah.
[1:24:51] [Music]
[1:24:57] Just
[1:24:58] as I
[1:25:01] am
[1:25:04] without one
[1:25:07] plea, but
[1:25:09] that thy
[1:25:12] blood was
[1:25:15] shed for
[1:25:18] me and
[1:25:21] that thou
[1:25:24] bit me.
[1:25:27] Come to
[1:25:30] thee, oh
[1:25:33] lamb of
[1:25:35] God. I
[1:25:39] come.
[1:25:42] I come. That verse again.
[1:25:48] Just
[1:25:49] as I
[1:25:52] am
[1:25:55] without one
[1:25:57] plea, but
[1:26:00] that thy
[1:26:03] blood was
[1:26:05] shed for
[1:26:09] me, and
[1:26:11] that thou
[1:26:13] bid me.
[1:26:16] Come to
[1:26:19] thee, oh
[1:26:22] lamb of
[1:26:24] God. I
[1:26:28] come.
[1:26:30] I come.
[1:26:32] You know the ministry of the great
[1:26:35] evangelist Billy
[1:26:37] Graham. He would close a sermon very
[1:26:40] often, I'd say usually with this song.
[1:26:44] And how many millions of people came to
[1:26:48] the Lord Jesus
[1:26:49] Christ from this song that was calling
[1:26:54] them just as I
[1:26:57] am. Poor, wretched, blind. Think about
[1:27:00] Paul. Just as I am. And there Paul is
[1:27:04] laying there. Poor, wretched,
[1:27:08] mean-spirited and
[1:27:11] blind. And yet God had mercy on
[1:27:15] him and turned him into one of the
[1:27:17] greatest servants in the world.
[1:27:21] Friends, he had mercy on Paul. He had
[1:27:24] mercy on me. He had mercy on
[1:27:27] you. Let that mustard seed, let it
[1:27:30] bloom. Let it
[1:27:33] sprout. Because if you do, you have no
[1:27:37] idea what God can do. He can do great
[1:27:40] things with all of
[1:27:42] us. But if we got to we just we got to
[1:27:45] make that decision first. Lord, I give
[1:27:47] my heart to you. I stand with you, God.
[1:27:51] Whatever you require, I'll do it. Saul
[1:27:56] of
[1:27:57] Tarsus, he had that attitude once he
[1:28:00] knew that Jesus was in fact the Christ.
[1:28:05] And if we will do the
[1:28:06] same, friends, there's no telling what
[1:28:10] God will do. We're in this field of the
[1:28:13] world. We're not going to change the
[1:28:16] whole field. It is what it is. But we
[1:28:18] can have an influence just like that
[1:28:20] leaven in that that bread. We can have a
[1:28:23] le we can have an influence on the whole
[1:28:25] loaf. And I want to do it just as I am.
[1:28:31] Just
[1:28:32] as I
[1:28:35] am. For
[1:28:37] [Music]
[1:28:38] wretched
[1:28:40] blind, sight
[1:28:44] riches,
[1:28:46] healing
[1:28:48] of the
[1:28:51] mind. Yay.
[1:28:53] All I
[1:28:56] need in
[1:28:58] thee to
[1:29:01] find
[1:29:04] all of
[1:29:06] God I come.
[1:29:12] I come just as I am in waiting not.
[1:29:16] [Music]
[1:29:18] just
[1:29:19] as I
[1:29:21] am and
[1:29:25] waiting
[1:29:27] not to rid it my
[1:29:32] soul of
[1:29:34] one dark
[1:29:37] blood to
[1:29:39] thee whose
[1:29:42] blood can
[1:29:44] cleanse each
[1:29:47] God, oh
[1:29:50] lamb of
[1:29:52] God, I come.
[1:29:58] [Music]
[1:29:59] That verse again, just
[1:30:02] as I
[1:30:04] [Music]
[1:30:05] am,
[1:30:08] waiting
[1:30:10] on
[1:30:12] to my soul.
[1:30:16] of
[1:30:17] one
[1:30:20] dark. To
[1:30:22] thee who
[1:30:25] blood can
[1:30:27] cleanse each
[1:30:30] [Music]
[1:30:33] fall of
[1:30:35] God I come.
[1:30:38] [Music]
[1:30:45] Worship
[1:30:46] him. When he calls
[1:30:48] you, come and say, "Lord, here I am.
[1:30:53] Send me, Lord. Lord, water that that
[1:30:57] seed that's in
[1:30:59] me, Lord. Change
[1:31:01] me. Change me from a weed to a
[1:31:05] wheat. And never never look around you
[1:31:09] and judge anyone else and think that
[1:31:13] they are not that
[1:31:16] pure wheat of God. Even though they
[1:31:21] might look like something
[1:31:23] else, God can change them. He changed
[1:31:27] you, Manny. He changed me, Lionel. He
[1:31:30] changed
[1:31:31] you. He's changed He's changed so many
[1:31:34] of us.
[1:31:36] changed us
[1:31:37] from well the person that I
[1:31:41] was to the person that I am. And the
[1:31:44] best thing about it with me, he ain't
[1:31:47] done. There's a whole lot more of
[1:31:50] growing. And that weed's going to keep
[1:31:52] blooming. It's going to keep coming.
[1:31:53] Let's Let's all stand and sing it again.
[1:31:55] Brother Josiah.
[1:31:59] Just
[1:32:01] as I
[1:32:03] am, thou
[1:32:06] wilt
[1:32:09] receive will
[1:32:14] dwell,
[1:32:16] cleanse,
[1:32:19] relieve
[1:32:21] because thy
[1:32:25] promise I
[1:32:29] Believe oh
[1:32:32] lamb of
[1:32:35] God I
[1:32:38] come.
[1:32:41] I
[1:32:43] [Music]
[1:32:47] come. My chains are gone.
[1:32:53] I've been saved. Praise God.
[1:32:57] Thank you Lord. My God, my
[1:33:02] Savior has ransomed
[1:33:04] [Music]
[1:33:06] me. And like a
[1:33:11] flood his mercy
[1:33:15] raise,
[1:33:17] unending
[1:33:20] love, amazing grace. I was speaking to a
[1:33:24] young man
[1:33:25] yesterday and I was talking about the
[1:33:30] Lord
[1:33:32] and he said, "Well," he was talking to
[1:33:35] me about all the
[1:33:37] rules and regulations and all that in
[1:33:39] the churches that he's been to. And I
[1:33:42] said, "Brother, let me tell you
[1:33:43] something." I said, "When you truly
[1:33:46] accept Jesus Christ as your savior,
[1:33:49] those chains are gone. There is liberty
[1:33:53] and freedom in Jesus Christ. You mis you
[1:33:59] misunderstand. There is liberty and
[1:34:01] freedom in Jesus Christ. And it's the
[1:34:05] world and Satan that binds us. It may he
[1:34:09] may work through he may work through
[1:34:11] addiction. He may work through your
[1:34:14] church. But God sets us free. Amen. The
[1:34:19] liberation of Jesus
[1:34:21] Christ. One more time. Amen.
[1:34:32] Amazing
[1:34:34] grace, how
[1:34:36] sweet the
[1:34:38] sound that
[1:34:41] saved a
[1:34:43] rich like me.
[1:34:48] I
[1:34:50] once was
[1:34:52] lost but
[1:34:54] now I'm
[1:34:57] found. Was
[1:34:59] blind but
[1:35:02] now I It was grace.
[1:35:07] It was
[1:35:08] grace that
[1:35:11] taught my
[1:35:13] heart to fear.
[1:35:16] and
[1:35:18] grace my
[1:35:20] fears relie.
[1:35:25] Praise God. How
[1:35:27] preious
[1:35:29] did that
[1:35:32] grace
[1:35:34] appear the
[1:35:36] hour I
[1:35:38] first believe.
[1:35:43] My chains are gone.
[1:35:46] Thank you, Lord Jesus. I've been set
[1:35:49] free.
[1:35:52] My God, my
[1:35:56] Savior has ransom
[1:35:59] [Music]
[1:36:01] me. And like a
[1:36:05] flood his mercy reigns.
[1:36:11] Unending
[1:36:14] love, amazing grace.
[1:36:20] Are your chains gone?
[1:36:22] If they're
[1:36:23] not, you have the opportunity to drop
[1:36:27] them right here. Then you can leave them
[1:36:29] in this church. We'll throw them
[1:36:32] away. You never have to put them back
[1:36:34] on. That's the liberty of Jesus Christ.
[1:36:38] Bow our heads.
[1:36:39] [Music]
[1:36:44] If there'd be anybody
[1:36:46] here, man,
[1:36:50] woman, young lady, young man, or child
[1:36:54] that would want to give your heart to
[1:36:56] Jesus Christ and shed the chains of the
[1:36:58] world, now would be a good
[1:37:02] time. Our
[1:37:04] father, you know the hearts of every
[1:37:06] person here.
[1:37:11] Lord, you
[1:37:12] know our needs. You know our
[1:37:15] faults. And Father, you know if we're a
[1:37:20] weed, if we're a wheat or if we're a
[1:37:24] tear. Father, I can't help believe that
[1:37:27] every soul in this building here is a
[1:37:31] wheat. Father, bless each one, I pray.
[1:37:34] And if there would be Lord someone that
[1:37:37] you're working on their hearts, I pray
[1:37:40] that they would receive what you have
[1:37:43] for them. May the Holy Spirit enter into
[1:37:45] that person or those
[1:37:47] people. Go with us, Father. Prepare our
[1:37:50] hearts. We
[1:37:51] pray for our communion service
[1:37:54] tonight. May it be pleasing to you in
[1:37:58] Jesus name. Amen.
