[15:42] Lord and you know who's in control, you
[15:45] can
[15:47] rest. Start off with some praises.
[15:51] Um, first I'd like to thank everyone for
[15:54] keeping me and my dad in prayer. This
[15:56] week we went up to Seattle area to see
[15:59] uh Lori. She's doing
[16:02] better. It was good for both of them to
[16:06] to be able to talk and see each other.
[16:08] Um, she's
[16:10] still in a critical situation,
[16:13] but everything that happens is a
[16:16] miracle. And we're even the medical
[16:19] staff is acknowledging that she's a
[16:23] miracle, a living miracle. So we want to
[16:25] thank the Lord for that. Sister Amelia
[16:28] wants to thank the Lord for answering
[16:31] her prayers once
[16:33] again. She's a lot better. Also, her
[16:36] daughter will be living with uh with her
[16:39] as uh she lives alone.
[16:43] She's hoping for a two-bedroom room
[16:46] soon. So, let's
[16:48] um thank the Lord for answering
[16:53] prayer. Sister Rachel
[16:55] Gara has turned in a request. Please
[16:59] remember Sister Jacqueline in prayer.
[17:01] She was in a car accident. She's not
[17:03] hurt, but her car was totaled. The
[17:06] driver of the other car was taken to the
[17:08] hospital with neck pain.
[17:14] Brother Jonathan
[17:16] Gonzalez, I ask please pray for my
[17:18] friend Ricardo Noriega. His sister
[17:21] Marita Noriega committed suicide and his
[17:24] cousin
[17:26] Jesse Gonzalez passed away yesterday by
[17:29] an overdose. Also pray for him as well
[17:33] that God continues to grant me peace and
[17:35] comfort.
[17:37] Brother Dan, our pastor, brother Daniel
[17:40] Evans, has turned in a
[17:44] request. And this request is something
[17:47] that's already been done in the Bible.
[17:50] Solomon asked the Lord for
[17:53] wisdom. And God gave him wisdom. He
[17:56] didn't ask
[17:57] for anything else but wisdom so that he
[18:01] could judge God's people.
[18:04] This request is from Judge Daniel
[18:07] Danielle Longford from the Puma County
[18:10] Juvenile Court. She's asking us here at
[18:13] Tucson Tabernacle to pray that God will
[18:15] grant her wisdom in judging these very
[18:18] important cases. So, let's remember that
[18:22] in prayer. Do you have something with
[18:23] your that you'd like to make known with
[18:26] an uplifted hand before the
[18:29] Lord? Our gracious heavenly father,
[18:32] you've you've already seen these
[18:35] requests, Lord. We want to commit them
[18:37] into your hands once once again,
[18:41] Lord, knowing that Lord, you you've
[18:44] heard them. You knew
[18:46] that they'd be written out this morning,
[18:49] knew exactly what the need was. So,
[18:53] Father, we want to ask you through your
[18:56] grace and your mercy, would you extend
[18:59] your hand upon each
[19:01] request, each one that was written out,
[19:03] each hand that was raised?
[19:06] Heavenly Father, would you just minister
[19:08] onto the
[19:10] need? Lord, for comfort
[19:14] from those that have lost a loved one.
[19:18] Lord, it's hard to lose someone that you
[19:20] love and or know and ask, Lord, that
[19:22] you'd comfort the
[19:24] family. Lord, this request of young man
[19:28] going to the hospital with neck pain,
[19:30] we'd ask Lord that you touch him, Lord.
[19:35] Lord, I want to thank you for what
[19:36] you've done for my sister, for the
[19:39] testimony that's been shown already,
[19:42] Father. And Lord, there are many needs
[19:46] here. You're so mindful of each of your
[19:49] children, Lord, and the needs and the
[19:51] things that they go through and the
[19:54] request and we commit them into your
[19:56] hands, Lord. this judge that's asking
[19:59] for
[20:00] wisdom. Lord, what better thing to ask
[20:02] for, Lord, besides salvation, but
[20:07] wisdom. So, Father, we'd ask that you'd
[20:10] gr grant the wisdom to to this
[20:14] judge. Would you be with the remainder
[20:17] of this service, the remainder of the
[20:19] songs, would you receive honor and glory
[20:22] from him, Lord? Would you bless our
[20:25] pastor as he breaks forth the words of
[20:27] [Music]
[20:29] life? Move him out of the way, Lord, and
[20:32] anoint our hearts and our ears to hear
[20:34] and to
[20:35] receive. We thank you, Lord, for meeting
[20:38] us this morning, for blessing us with
[20:41] your
[20:42] presence. Now, Lord, if there's anything
[20:44] in in here that would hinder the moving
[20:47] of your spirit, would you just take it
[20:48] away? Yes. Lord, let set our spirit free
[20:52] that we can worship
[20:54] [Music]
[20:56] you. And Lord, would
[20:59] you bless the offering that's about to
[21:01] be
[21:02] taken? Bless those that
[21:05] give that it might be used for the
[21:08] furtherance of your glory. And we thank
[21:11] you for answering our prayers in the
[21:13] precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

[29:12] would manifest itself in in our lives.

[30:47] "Victory." Woo! Well, victory is
[30:51] mine. Victory is

[31:58] today is is along the lines of what the
[32:01] Lord wants this morning and I'm just I'm
[32:03] grateful to be here. First, I want to
[32:05] greet our visitors. I didn't get a list
[32:07] of visitors, but welcome. God bless you
[32:09] all. If I if I don't know you, welcome.
[32:12] We're honored to have you. And uh please
[32:15] I want to meet you. If I haven't met
[32:16] you, I want to meet you after service.
[32:18] So, please hang around a little bit for
[32:20] the the pastor to come back and at least
[32:22] say hello. Um, you're always welcome.
[32:26] You're you're um when we bring a little
[32:29] bit of fire from over here and we bring
[32:31] a little bit of fire from over there and
[32:34] then we have our fire here in the
[32:36] church, it just gets to be a bigger
[32:38] fire. And that's that's what we
[32:41] want. Our uh our brother Lyall Johnson
[32:45] is been going through the um the life of
[32:49] King David. And brother Lyle always has,
[32:52] it seems like he always has a date, an
[32:55] important date that when we come and you
[32:57] say, "Well, this is this is the
[32:59] Passover, the original Passover. This is
[33:02] this feast or this is that feast." And
[33:04] and today is a uh today is a notable
[33:07] date. It's the unofficial, I think,
[33:11] unsanctioned Star Wars day.
[33:17] Today is May 4th and then that's I guess
[33:19] what they they call the Star Wars day
[33:21] and and it goes to say May the Fourth be
[33:25] with you.
[33:30] Oh
[33:32] man, that was
[33:34] bad. For those streaming in, I got
[33:36] absolutely no response. It was dead. It
[33:39] It was quiet. But tough
[33:42] crowd. God bless God bless you. I I put
[33:45] in that prayer request uh for this
[33:47] judge. We were at the adoption ceremony
[33:51] for um uh young uh
[33:55] Michaela and the the judge was really
[33:59] taken back by how many people we had
[34:00] there for brother Jeremy, sister Angela.
[34:04] They're now their second child that
[34:06] they've adopted.
[34:13] The judge was um she was very
[34:17] happy. And afterwards, we we were all
[34:20] greeting each other and and taking
[34:22] pictures and everything after the
[34:24] official ceremony. And uh as as the
[34:27] people were trickling out of the
[34:28] courtroom, I walked over to the judge
[34:31] and I said um I said, "I just want to
[34:34] tell you thank you for for what you've
[34:37] done." And uh she said she said, "You
[34:41] can tell these kids are loved." And she
[34:45] said, "All of you hugging the kids." And
[34:46] she says, "You have such a supportive
[34:48] community." And she said, "I I wish
[34:51] every case was like this." And I said,
[34:54] "Oh, yeah." I said, "It's I said, "We
[34:56] all treat those kids like they're our
[34:59] own." I said, "I'm the pastor of of this
[35:01] group." And she uh she stood up and she
[35:04] said, "Come here." and the bench is up
[35:07] higher. So I walked over to uh to the
[35:11] bench and and she shook my hand and she
[35:14] said um she says, "I have a
[35:17] request." She said, "Would you and your
[35:19] church pray for me?" She said, "Pray
[35:23] that I have wisdom to judge." She said,
[35:26] "These things that I'm judging are very,
[35:28] very important. They affect people's
[35:29] lives and and their futures." And she
[35:32] said, "They're dependent on my on my
[35:35] judgment." And she teared up. And then I
[35:38] kind of started to tear up and and she
[35:41] said, "Would you just pray for me?" And
[35:45] I said, "Yeah." I said, "I'll have our
[35:46] church pray for you." So that was the
[35:48] prayer request that I put in
[35:52] earlier. Uh it it was it was a really
[35:54] sweet experience. It's um it was a good
[35:57] example for us to set with all these
[35:59] people in there and all the love and all
[36:01] the happiness. Most juvenile court
[36:03] cases, they're not like that. They're
[36:05] they're very difficult. And it was nice
[36:07] to represent um represent the Lord,
[36:10] represent this church.
[36:12] I um I wanted to minister this morning
[36:17] on making an adjustment in your life.
[36:21] And I got the inspiration. And I was
[36:23] talking to my cousin uh who lives in
[36:26] Jeffersonville. He's he's from Tucson.
[36:28] His name's Austin Smith and Austin is
[36:32] like 69 or
[36:34] 610. And he was a just a gifted gifted
[36:38] athlete. Played college basketball at
[36:40] Liberty
[36:41] College. And he was uh his roommate was
[36:46] I believe it was Seth Curry who is the
[36:50] brother to Steph Curry. has anybody
[36:53] heard that name before? One of the
[36:55] greatest basketball players ever lived.
[36:57] He's he's playing now. And um and so he
[37:01] he knew them well. and they were
[37:03] shooting around and Austin was a like I
[37:06] said he's a very gifted athlete and he
[37:10] would shoot and he'd always hit the
[37:12] front of the
[37:14] rim in his jump shot and he kept
[37:17] shooting and every single time it would
[37:20] hit the front of the rim and bounce out.
[37:23] So pretty soon Steph Curry goes to
[37:26] Austin. He says, "Hey," he says, he
[37:28] says, "Either you can keep hitting the
[37:30] front of the
[37:33] rim for the rest of your career." He
[37:36] says, "Or you can make an adjustment to
[37:37] your jump
[37:38] shot." And he tells Austin, he says,
[37:41] "Just do this." He says, "When you shoot
[37:43] now, start shooting at the back of the
[37:45] rim instead of shooting in the center."
[37:49] So Austin made he uh he made an
[37:52] adjustment and he started sinking his
[37:56] jump shot. But he had to if he wouldn't
[37:59] have made a change, he had to get a
[38:01] little bit out of his comfort zone. If
[38:03] he wouldn't have made a change, he
[38:05] wouldn't
[38:07] have
[38:08] improved and his team wouldn't have
[38:10] benefited from his his new jump shot.
[38:13] And he did. And he he started he started
[38:15] doing better.
[38:16] So my point in saying that and what I
[38:19] got from what Austin said and he was
[38:21] telling me this in this context. He was
[38:23] we were talking about the church and we
[38:25] were talking about just our faith and he
[38:27] said he told me he said Daniel he says
[38:30] sometime we need to make an adjustment
[38:33] if we're if we keep and I said this if
[38:37] we keep doing what we're doing we're
[38:38] going to keep getting what we got.
[38:42] Daniel and I, that was on my heart. And
[38:44] then Daniel, my son, and I, we went
[38:46] fishing last week. And uh we were doing,
[38:51] well, Daniel was doing good. And I had
[38:53] my favorite lure. It's about a four or
[38:58] five inch Rapala minnow. Um, hard
[39:01] plastic uh top water bait that I've
[39:04] caught. I caught my biggest bass I've
[39:06] ever caught. Over seven pounds on that
[39:08] on that lure. And I I just really like
[39:11] that lure. And I was fishing with it and
[39:14] I wasn't catching nothing, man. And then
[39:17] Daniel, he ties on a worm.
[39:22] And that kid was slaying them. And he's
[39:25] like, "Dad, you know, you should you
[39:27] should tie in on a worm." And I was
[39:29] like, "No, son. I'm going to stick with
[39:32] my Rapala minnow." And I kept fishing
[39:34] and and I kept not catching.
[39:38] And Daniel kept fishing and he kept
[39:39] catching. And if you show that first
[39:42] picture, we get back and this isn't even
[39:44] all of them. This is this is Daniel's
[39:48] first string. And look at those small
[39:49] mouth on the left there. Big old
[39:52] bass. And we get back and and Daniel's
[39:55] feeling really good. And I'm feeling I'm
[39:58] proud of my son. I'm feeling good, but
[40:00] not about my performance. Next slide. It
[40:03] wasn't so great.
[40:08] We get back and I'd been preaching to my
[40:12] son all morning about making an
[40:14] adjustment in your life. And man, I like
[40:17] that Rapol though. Kept fishing with it
[40:20] and and nothing was happening with that
[40:22] thing. So then I made an adjustment and
[40:27] I tied on a uh a rubber jig to jig
[40:31] across the bottom. And then my fortune
[40:36] changed here. Get past that slide,
[40:40] please. There we go. And then Yeah. And
[40:44] then it
[40:45] started. But that was because I made an
[40:49] adjustment. And if I would have stayed
[40:51] with that Roloto, I might have caught
[40:53] Okay, we can put the the fish down.
[40:55] Well, maybe not for a while. No, I'm
[40:56] just kidding. But I I had to make an
[40:59] adjustment. I had to make a change in my
[41:03] life. And that's how it is with us,
[41:06] friends, as Christians. If things aren't
[41:10] going the way that they should be going
[41:13] or if you're not seeing the results that
[41:15] you should be seeing, we need to make an
[41:18] adjustment in our lives. And I can
[41:21] preach a sermon and you can go home and
[41:23] you can say, "Boy, that sermon really
[41:25] condemned me. boy that, you know, I I
[41:28] never thought of it like that or I never
[41:30] never read the Bible like that. But if
[41:32] it doesn't produce a change in your
[41:34] life, then it's no good. Then nothing
[41:37] happened. Then I I was just shooting at
[41:39] the back of the rim or I was just
[41:41] pulling in that that crankbait that
[41:43] wasn't working. But if it actually
[41:45] produces a
[41:47] change, then it's a success.
[41:51] The Bible says Jesus said, he said,
[41:53] "Make disciples of all
[41:56] nations." And if we're not doing
[41:58] that, how are we doing what this Bible
[42:02] says to do? If we're not reaching out
[42:06] and we're not winning souls, and those
[42:07] souls may not be your neighbors, those
[42:09] souls may not be people on the street.
[42:10] Those souls may be our children. May and
[42:14] may be our our friends. And if we look
[42:17] at our children and we see how they have
[42:20] gone maybe into
[42:23] sin
[42:25] and sometimes we may want to look at
[42:29] ourselves and say Lord what have I done
[42:33] wrong? What did I do wrong in this? And
[42:36] you may not have done anything wrong,
[42:38] but we should still examine ourselves
[42:41] and say, "What? Lord, if I've done
[42:43] something
[42:45] wrong, change me." No matter how old you
[42:47] are, your kids may be 50 years old or
[42:50] they may be six years old, but Lord,
[42:53] change me
[42:55] that I can now help them. Let me make an
[43:00] adjustment in in my life so I can help
[43:03] them. The biggest adjustment I ever made
[43:07] in my life was on September 11th,
[43:11] 2006. A very simple thing. This
[43:14] adjustment was more than me getting
[43:17] baptized. This adjudgment, this judgment
[43:20] was more than me becoming pastor here.
[43:23] This judgment or this uh this adjustment
[43:27] was more than anything that I had ever
[43:28] done in my life. And what I did on that
[43:31] day, on that morning, September 11th,
[43:34] 2006, is I woke up 30 minutes earlier
[43:38] than I usually do. And I devoted that
[43:41] time to Jesus Christ. I devoted that
[43:45] time to reading my
[43:49] Bible. And it was more friends. It was
[43:53] more than even giving my heart to the
[43:55] Lord. It was more than my day, the day
[43:59] of my baptism. It was more than any
[44:01] other day. That adjustment I made that
[44:05] day was 30 minutes. And 30 minutes
[44:07] quickly turned into an
[44:09] hour. It was studying my Bible every day
[44:12] of my
[44:14] life.
[44:15] Praying. And then that affected every
[44:19] single thing that I did in life. Was
[44:22] that one
[44:24] adjustment? My fish. the fish started
[44:27] biting. You know, the jump start, the
[44:29] jump shot started
[44:32] sinking. And
[44:34] in today, I want to talk about a couple
[44:38] people that made a major adjustment in
[44:41] their life and they benefited from it.
[44:44] We know the
[44:45] kings and we know that the first king,
[44:50] brother Lio and I have been going back
[44:51] and forth with King Saul and King David.
[44:54] Those are the first two kings of Israel.
[44:57] King Saul was the first king. David
[44:59] followed him. David's son was named
[45:02] Solomon. And this is a united Israel
[45:05] with 12 tribes. Solomon or David's son
[45:09] Solomon. When he died, the kingdom went
[45:15] to Solomon's
[45:17] son. And
[45:19] then from that time on, the kingdom
[45:22] split.
[45:23] there there started to be fighting.
[45:25] There wasn't good leadership there. It
[45:27] split into what was called Israel to the
[45:30] north, 10 tribes up there in the north
[45:32] and then Judah, two tribes in the south
[45:35] made up of Judah and Benjamin. So now we
[45:38] see these two separate countries. We
[45:40] have Judah in the south. We have um
[45:44] Israel in the north. The capital of
[45:45] Judah was a famous city we all know of
[45:48] Jerusalem. The capital of Israel was
[45:51] Samaria in the north. There after
[45:56] Solomon and when the kingdom split into
[46:00] two different kingdoms, there was never
[46:03] a good king that ever came out of the
[46:07] northern the northern kingdom of Israel.
[46:10] So whenever you see a king in the Bible
[46:13] that that served the Lord, it was never
[46:17] from Israel.
[46:19] There were a few, most of them didn't,
[46:22] but there were a few from Judah that did
[46:24] serve the Lord. One of the greatest of
[46:27] those was this man named
[46:29] Hezekiah.
[46:31] Hezekiah, he was a man that prayed. He
[46:33] was a man that loved the Lord. He was a
[46:35] man that when the idols would start to
[46:38] pop up in
[46:40] Judah, uh, Hezekiah tore them down.
[46:43] Hezekiah built great infrastructure in
[46:46] Jerusalem. He was a good king and a and
[46:48] a king that loved the Lord. Hezekiah had
[46:52] a
[46:53] son. And this son did not serve God.
[46:58] This son, this son's name was
[47:01] Manasseh. Manasseh did things that were
[47:04] not pleasing to God. Let me read and I'm
[47:07] going to read the paraphrase version of
[47:10] this. The uh I'm going to read the New
[47:12] Living Translation. It's not the New
[47:14] Living Translation isn't a necessarily a
[47:16] study Bible, one that that you can go in
[47:18] and just go down to the brass tax, but
[47:20] it it paraphrases it gives you the
[47:22] general idea of what's going on. It says
[47:25] this,
[47:26] Manasseh even made a carved
[47:29] image of Ashira and set up uh not not
[47:33] that not that uh I'm in I'm in second
[47:36] Kings. Uh Manasseh even made a card
[47:38] image of Ashira and set up the temple.
[47:42] The very place where the Lord had told
[47:44] David, his son David and his son
[47:46] Solomon, "My name will be honored
[47:48] forever in this temple and in Jerusalem,
[47:51] the city I have chosen from among the
[47:54] all the tribes of Israel. The Israelites
[47:56] will be careful to if if the Israelites
[47:59] will be careful to obey my commandments,
[48:01] all the laws of my servant that my
[48:04] servant Moses gave them, I will not send
[48:06] them into exile from this land that ga
[48:09] that I gave their ancestors." But the
[48:12] people refused to listen and Manasseh
[48:15] led them to do even more evil than the
[48:18] pagan nations that the Lord had
[48:20] destroyed when the people of Israel
[48:23] entered the land. Then the Lord said
[48:26] through his servants, the prophets, King
[48:28] Manasseh of Judah has done many
[48:32] detestable things. He is even more
[48:34] wicked than the Amorites who lived in
[48:36] this land before Israel. He caused the
[48:38] people of Judah to sin with his
[48:42] idols. So this is what the Lord Lord the
[48:46] God of Israel says. I will bring such
[48:49] disaster on Jerusalem and Judah that the
[48:51] ears of those who hear about it will
[48:54] tingle with horror.
[48:56] I will judge Jerusalem by the same
[48:58] standard I used for Samaria and the same
[49:00] measure I used for the family of Ahab. I
[49:03] will wipe away the people of Jerusalem
[49:05] as one wipes a dish and turns it upside
[49:08] down. Then I will reject even the
[49:11] remnant of my own people who are left
[49:14] and I will hand them over as plunder for
[49:17] their enemies. For they have done great
[49:19] evil in my sight and have angered me
[49:22] ever since their ancestors came out of
[49:25] Egypt.
[49:27] Now, we have a background on this King
[49:29] Hezekiah and we have a background on his
[49:32] son Manasseh. This guy did bad stuff. He
[49:38] did not stay with the word of God that
[49:40] Moses had brought to them. He He sinned.
[49:44] He set up idols before the people. Now,
[49:48] let's turn in our Bibles to 2 Chronicles
[49:50] chapter 33 verse 9.
[49:57] So
[49:58] Manasseh. Yes. So Manasseh made Judah
[50:02] and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to heir
[50:04] and to do worse than the heathen whom
[50:06] the Lord had destroyed before the before
[50:09] the children of Israel. And the Lord
[50:12] spake to Manasseh and to his people, but
[50:15] they would not
[50:16] hearken. How'd the Lord speak to the
[50:20] people? He spoke.
[50:23] He speaks from the pulpit in church. He
[50:27] speaks through
[50:29] prophets. He speaks through
[50:32] parents. He speaks through just reading
[50:34] his
[50:35] word. God has different ways to speak to
[50:40] us, but the people would not
[50:44] listen. Manasseh should have known the
[50:47] instructions that I just read to David
[50:50] and to Solomon. And if the Israelites
[50:51] will be careful to obey my commandments,
[50:53] all the laws my servant Moses gave them,
[50:56] I will not send them into exile from
[50:58] from this land that I gave to their
[51:00] ancestors. But Manasseh didn't heed to
[51:02] those that
[51:04] warning. He really Manasseh probably
[51:06] didn't actually know the biblical
[51:08] teachings. He didn't know his Bible. And
[51:11] how do I know this? because later on
[51:14] we're going to find out through a king
[51:17] that came down uh two generations later
[51:20] that the people weren't reading their
[51:22] Bibles. When you stop reading your
[51:24] Bible, friends, when you stop going to
[51:27] church, when you stop hearing the word,
[51:30] all of those things, that is when you
[51:33] let your spiritual guard down and you
[51:36] open yourself up to the influences of
[51:40] the devil. and you don't know you're
[51:43] doing it. This word, this book is a
[51:48] guide. This book is a protection and we
[51:51] need to stay in it. And if we don't,
[51:54] it's amazing what we'll allow into our
[51:56] lives and really without even knowing
[51:59] it. And
[52:01] Manasseh, he let these things
[52:05] slip. The word of God, as David said in
[52:07] the Psalms, the word of God is a lamp
[52:09] unto our feet. It lights our path. And
[52:12] if we don't have that light, we're going
[52:14] to be wandering around in darkness. It's
[52:17] like it's like the Catholic Church. The
[52:19] Catholic Church started out right, but
[52:23] they got
[52:24] off of of the original vision of the
[52:28] apostles and they started lifting up
[52:32] godly
[52:34] men, Peter and James and John and even
[52:37] even Mary and Mary Magdalene. And it
[52:39] wasn't long before they started putting
[52:41] these images of these people up in their
[52:43] pullpits
[52:45] and they started having their relics in
[52:48] in their
[52:49] churches. And you think,
[52:51] well, that's we would never do something
[52:54] like
[52:55] that. You think that the people
[52:57] throughout his history didn't think that
[52:59] they wouldn't be doing the same thing?
[53:02] And then if you say that this is wrong,
[53:04] if someone would argue say, 'N no, you
[53:05] shouldn't pe put relics and you
[53:08] shouldn't put images of of men of God up
[53:12] on your pulpits or in your churches or
[53:14] or these relics. They'll say, "Oh, well,
[53:16] you
[53:17] disrespect these people."
[53:19] No, you're not disrespecting these
[53:22] people as as as the Catholic Church
[53:24] might teach. you are respecting them in
[53:27] that they were pointing to one thing and
[53:30] that was this cross and that was Jesus
[53:32] Christ who died on the cross. But when
[53:34] you lift something up, put it in your
[53:38] churches and you put this book
[53:42] away, you never know where you're going
[53:45] to end up. And then finally, one day
[53:46] you're going to sit back and say,
[53:47] "Whoa."
[53:49] Hopefully, you're going to say, "Wait a
[53:50] minute.
[53:52] I have gone a long way down this road
[53:55] and look at what's happened.
[53:59] Manasseh and all the people of Judah,
[54:02] they stopped, as I said, they stopped
[54:04] going to church. They stopped reading
[54:05] their Bibles, but they didn't stop
[54:09] worshiping. It's human. It's in a human
[54:12] being to worship. You're going to
[54:15] worship something. And if you take the
[54:17] Bible out of your
[54:20] life, then you're still going to you're
[54:22] going to replace it with something,
[54:23] right? And it could be music. It could
[54:28] be other worldly things or it could be
[54:31] some sort of a religion that has got off
[54:34] the path. And that's what happened to
[54:36] this man, Manasseh. He was very sincere,
[54:39] this king, very sincere in his in his um
[54:43] in his religion. And I'm going to prove
[54:45] that here in a minute, probably more
[54:47] sincere than anyone
[54:48] here. And the Lord spake to Manasseh.
[54:51] Read verse 10 again. And the Lord spake
[54:52] to Manasseh and to his people, but they
[54:55] would not listen. Now, here's so much.
[54:57] I'm a believer. I have Jesus in my
[54:59] heart. I'm a Christian. I I I love the
[55:02] Lord. And these these people that we're
[55:04] talking about here who Manasseh was
[55:06] over, they were Jews. They were God's
[55:08] chosen people. In fact, they were from
[55:11] the lineage of
[55:13] Judah who the very Messiah would come
[55:17] from. These people were God's chosen
[55:21] people. And yet they strayed. And
[55:24] Manasseh was so
[55:26] sincere in his religion. This king, he
[55:29] was so believed it so much that he
[55:33] sacrificed his son in the fire.
[55:38] You think, "Oh, he was just some id
[55:39] idolattor, crazy idol worshipper." He
[55:42] was a
[55:43] man. He was a man that that probably
[55:46] loved his children just like we love our
[55:48] children. And he believed in what he was
[55:51] doing so much that he took his son and
[55:55] killed him to a false god. That's how
[55:58] much Manasseh believed.
[56:01] So just because you are strong or I am
[56:04] strong in our beliefs that does not mean
[56:07] that we are right. It he was sincere and
[56:10] just because you are sincere you can be
[56:13] sincerely wrong. Wow in what you
[56:17] believe. Most
[56:19] people I have met friends and and I say
[56:22] this
[56:24] I say this because it's true. Most
[56:26] people I've met, they value their own
[56:29] opinion more than they value the Bible.
[56:32] And they will agree with the Bible as
[56:34] long as the Bible agrees with them. Come
[56:36] on, brother.
[56:38] What they should be
[56:40] saying is, "Who cares what I think?" If
[56:44] this Bible says it, then I believe it
[56:46] and I'm going to do my best to apply it
[56:48] to my life and not try to ch change the
[56:51] Bible to match our doctrines. change our
[56:55] doctrines to match the book. Come on,
[56:58] brother. That's what we should do. We
[57:01] come out of a philosophy, the Catholic
[57:03] like like say the you come out of the
[57:05] Catholic Church, you come out of that
[57:06] philosophy that only maybe the Catholics
[57:09] are the chosen people of God. Others
[57:12] maybe they can enter into the kingdom,
[57:14] but the Catholic Church has a higher
[57:17] understanding. The Catholic people are
[57:19] the elect of God. The Catholic Church is
[57:21] the one true bride of Christ. I'm not
[57:23] just picking on the Catholic Church.
[57:24] They're just an easy
[57:27] target. So, so the the the Catholic
[57:30] Church is everything. They're they're
[57:32] that
[57:32] that great church that's going to
[57:35] inherit all things. And then you come
[57:38] out of that way of thinking like Martin
[57:40] Martin Luther did. He said no. He said
[57:42] that these medi these priests are not
[57:45] mediators between God and man. You can
[57:47] go straight to God. You don't have to go
[57:49] through a priest or a prophet. You don't
[57:51] have to do these things. And and you see
[57:52] that these these these priests instill
[57:55] fear in the people so that they can
[57:57] control them. And Martin Luther stood
[57:59] against that, right? And he he just he
[58:02] said, "No, you don't have to do this."
[58:04] And
[58:05] then one or two generations after Martin
[58:08] Luther, they were right
[58:10] back into the same thing to where you
[58:12] could almost see no separation between
[58:13] the Lutheran and the Catholics, maybe
[58:16] with communion or maybe with with a few
[58:20] other doctrines.
[58:22] He saw Martin Luther saw how the church
[58:24] had done things wrong and he he made an
[58:27] adjustment and it was successful. But if
[58:31] you don't keep making those adjustments,
[58:33] the next generation, it falls right back
[58:34] into it. And with Manasseh, that's what
[58:37] happened. Manasseh was so sincere as he
[58:40] sacrificed his own sons, yet he allowed
[58:43] sex and prostitution in the church.
[58:50] Yeah.
[58:51] He put up images on the
[58:53] walls, put
[58:56] relics out around the church in in
[58:59] different places so the people could see
[59:00] them and yet sincere. He wasn't reading
[59:04] his Bible. He didn't know that these
[59:07] things are were wrong. But then God had
[59:09] mercy on Manasseh. Yeah. It's the
[59:12] strangest thing. All that the Bible says
[59:14] about him and all the bad. Yet God,
[59:17] there was something in this man,
[59:19] something in this sinner king that God
[59:22] had mercy on.
[59:25] As bad as he was, by the mercy of God,
[59:29] Manasseh was taken prisoner by an
[59:32] invading
[59:33] army. Pulled him out of his
[59:35] comfort, put him in
[59:38] chains, put a hook in his
[59:42] nose, and Manasseh had some time to
[59:45] think about, to reflect. Am I right in
[59:49] what am I what I'm doing? Am I right in
[59:52] all of these things that that I have
[59:54] allowed as king that I have supported?
[59:57] Paul said, "Let a man examine himself."
[1:00:03] And then if we really examine ourselves,
[1:00:05] if we step back with the book open and
[1:00:08] we examine
[1:00:09] ourselves, we might say, "Brother
[1:00:11] Jonathan, look what I've
[1:00:14] become. Look at what Manasseh
[1:00:17] did. I'm not that far from that.
[1:00:22] It could be anything. Anything that you
[1:00:23] put before
[1:00:26] God. Sometimes you you might look at
[1:00:29] yourself and you might look at the
[1:00:30] gospels and you say, "Well, I have
[1:00:32] become a
[1:00:33] Pharisee. Where's my burden for the
[1:00:36] lost? I have become that. I I I look at
[1:00:40] and I say that
[1:00:41] that I might be that Pharisee or
[1:00:44] Sadducee that has no love for anyone
[1:00:47] else. I'm lifting myself up. I become
[1:00:50] that religion, that religious person
[1:00:53] like the Pharisees that is just trying
[1:00:55] to prove my religion to is right and not
[1:00:59] willing to
[1:01:01] surrender. But Manasseh is about to make
[1:01:04] that decision. Let's go to verse 11. Or
[1:01:08] for the Lord brought upon
[1:01:10] them the captains of the host of the
[1:01:13] king of Assyria, which took Manasseh
[1:01:15] among the thorns, and bound him with
[1:01:17] feathers, and carried him to Babylon.
[1:01:20] And when he was in affliction, he
[1:01:22] besought the Lord his
[1:01:26] God. And he humbled himself greatly
[1:01:28] before the God of his fathers. He said,
[1:01:30] "Look what I have become, but today I am
[1:01:33] making a change in my life. There are
[1:01:36] many things in our lives that we know
[1:01:38] are wrong. And Manasseh saw that and he
[1:01:41] said,"Lord, I'm going to change
[1:01:43] this and prayed unto him the
[1:01:47] Lord." And he was intreated of him and
[1:01:50] heard his supplication and brought him
[1:01:53] again to Jerusalem into his kingdom.
[1:01:55] Then Manasseh knew that the Lord he was
[1:01:59] God.
[1:02:01] New Living Translation of that last
[1:02:03] verse says, "And when he prayed, the
[1:02:05] Lord listened to him and was moved by
[1:02:08] his request." So the Lord brought
[1:02:10] Manasseh back to Jerusalem and to his
[1:02:12] kingdom. Then Manasseh finally realized
[1:02:14] that the Lord alone is God.
[1:02:18] What a wonderful feeling that must have
[1:02:21] been. All those years of sin and finally
[1:02:25] Manasseh was liberated from his sin. He
[1:02:28] made an adjustment. But it took with
[1:02:30] Manasseh, it took a shaking in his life.
[1:02:33] Everything had to fall apart. And many
[1:02:36] of us have been there where we might we
[1:02:38] might go into financial problems or or
[1:02:40] we might lose our family or there might
[1:02:42] be death or there might be a sickness
[1:02:43] that comes comes upon us and we find
[1:02:45] ourselves in Manasses position and we
[1:02:47] say, "Okay, Lord, I
[1:02:50] surrender. Lord, I give everything to
[1:02:52] you. Lord, just show me what is right."
[1:02:57] We let the Bible go when things are
[1:02:59] going well. We let prayer go and we
[1:03:01] become something we never expected.
[1:03:05] But God who is rich in mercy
[1:03:08] is there for us and he's waiting with
[1:03:11] open arms ready to give us the Bible
[1:03:14] says joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[1:03:17] And when Manasseh
[1:03:20] changed the whole the not only Manasseh
[1:03:22] changed but the whole kingdom changed.
[1:03:24] Go to verse 15. And he took away the
[1:03:27] strange gods. Manasseh did he took away
[1:03:29] the strange gods and the idol out of the
[1:03:31] house of the Lord and all the altars
[1:03:33] that he had
[1:03:35] built in the mount because the house of
[1:03:37] the Lord be because in the mount of the
[1:03:40] house of the Lord and in Jerusalem and
[1:03:42] he cast them out of the city and
[1:03:44] repaired the altar of the Lord and
[1:03:46] sacrificed thereon peace offerings and
[1:03:48] thank offerings and commanded Judah to
[1:03:52] serve the Lord God of Israel. Praise
[1:03:55] God. He made an adjustment in his life
[1:03:58] and it took a hardship for him to do it.
[1:04:02] When Austin, he made that adjustment
[1:04:05] with his jump shot and he started
[1:04:07] sinking his baskets. Not only was it
[1:04:09] good for Austin, but it was good for his
[1:04:11] whole team, right? And it's the same
[1:04:13] thing with with this Manasseh, it was
[1:04:16] good for the kingdom.
[1:04:18] When the leader made an adjustment in
[1:04:21] his life, it's good for our families.
[1:04:25] Yeah. When we make an adjustment,
[1:04:28] it's good for it's good for our church.
[1:04:32] Amen. When we make an adjustment, it's
[1:04:34] good for our country
[1:04:37] when the leaders make an adjustment.
[1:04:38] Amen. It's good when we turn to God and
[1:04:43] turn away from sin. Nevertheless, the
[1:04:46] people did sacrifice still in the high
[1:04:48] places, yet unto the Lord their God
[1:04:51] only. Let's go to verse number 21. Now,
[1:04:56] Manasseh died. He had a he had a nice
[1:04:58] long
[1:04:59] um reign. And then his son took over and
[1:05:03] there was no repentance in his son. And
[1:05:06] Am and Ammon was two and 20 years old
[1:05:09] when he began to reign. And he reigned
[1:05:10] two years in Jerusalem. But he did that
[1:05:13] which was evil in the sight of the Lord,
[1:05:15] as did Manasseh his
[1:05:17] father. For Ammon sacrificed unto all
[1:05:20] the carved images which Manasseh his
[1:05:22] father had made, and he served them, and
[1:05:24] he humbled not himself before the Lord,
[1:05:28] as Manasseh his father had humbled
[1:05:31] himself. That was the first step for
[1:05:33] Manasseh. That was the most important
[1:05:35] part was saying, you know what? I'm
[1:05:37] wrong. I've come to a place in my life.
[1:05:40] I shouldn't be here.
[1:05:42] But
[1:05:43] Ammon, he didn't have that
[1:05:47] humility. But Ammon trespassed more and
[1:05:50] more. And his servants conspired against
[1:05:52] him and slew him in his own house. But
[1:05:54] the people of the land slew all them
[1:05:56] that conspired against King Ammon. And
[1:05:59] the people of the land made Josiah his
[1:06:02] son, king in hisstead.
[1:06:07] Josiah was one of the greatest
[1:06:10] kings in Judah. And in fact, as you go
[1:06:14] down through the progression, there's
[1:06:15] three more kings after
[1:06:18] Josiah until they go into exile. And
[1:06:21] Josiah was the last good one in
[1:06:25] Judah. He
[1:06:27] um there was a
[1:06:30] prophecy about Josiah.
[1:06:33] A prophet came in to the church and he
[1:06:36] gives this prophecy and he names Josiah
[1:06:39] by name and he said this king is going
[1:06:43] to make things right. Let's let's turn
[1:06:44] there. Let's read that prophecy says
[1:06:47] this in first kings chapter 13 verse
[1:06:49] one. And behold there came a man out of
[1:06:52] God a man of God out of Judah by the
[1:06:54] word of the Lord unto Bethl and Jeroboam
[1:06:57] stood by the altar to burn incense. And
[1:06:59] he cried against the altar in the wood
[1:07:02] in the word of the Lord and said, "Oh
[1:07:04] altar, altar, thus sayeth the Lord,
[1:07:06] behold, a child shall be born unto the
[1:07:08] house of David, Josiah by name, and upon
[1:07:12] thee shall he offer the priests of the
[1:07:14] high places that burn incense upon thee,
[1:07:17] and men's bones shall be burnt upon
[1:07:19] thee." That was like
[1:07:22] 350 years before Josiah finally came.
[1:07:29] And then here comes this young man. He's
[1:07:32] eight years
[1:07:33] old. His dad was a
[1:07:36] sinner. His grandfather Manasseh. His
[1:07:38] dad Ammon was a sinner. His grandfather
[1:07:41] Manasseh was a sinner. His
[1:07:43] greatgrandfather Hezekiah was a good
[1:07:47] man. But something had lacked in the
[1:07:51] generations. And what was lacking was
[1:07:54] the
[1:07:56] Bible. And that is why they strayed.
[1:08:00] Friends, never
[1:08:02] think that you can't be deceived. Never
[1:08:05] think that you can't go wrong. If you
[1:08:08] let this Bible slip in your life, you
[1:08:11] open yourself up to the enemy. It may be
[1:08:13] a religious
[1:08:15] spirit. It may be a worldly
[1:08:17] spirit. Whatever it might be, you're
[1:08:21] disarmed when you're not in the word all
[1:08:24] the time. 2 Chronicles chapter 34. Let's
[1:08:27] read about
[1:08:28] Josiah. Let's finish with
[1:08:32] him. Josiah was 8 years old when he
[1:08:36] began to reign. And he reigned in
[1:08:38] Jerusalem one and 30 years. And he did
[1:08:41] that which was right in the sight of the
[1:08:42] Lord and walked in the ways of David his
[1:08:45] father and declined neither to the right
[1:08:47] hand nor to the left hand. English
[1:08:49] Standard Version says he did not turn
[1:08:51] aside to the right hand or to the left.
[1:08:55] Josiah kept his focus on God even as a
[1:08:58] young man for the eighth for in the
[1:09:00] eighth year of his reign while he was
[1:09:02] yet young. So he's 16 years
[1:09:05] old. When he was yet young he began to
[1:09:07] seek after the God of David his father.
[1:09:10] And in the 12th year he began to purge
[1:09:12] Judah and Jerusalem from the high places
[1:09:15] and the groves and the carved images and
[1:09:18] the molten images. So he saw listen all
[1:09:21] this stuff that you have all these
[1:09:22] relics this is wrong.
[1:09:24] and he gave his heart to the Lord at 16.
[1:09:27] And it's a perfect example of how that
[1:09:30] even that our young people 16 this is
[1:09:34] the usually the age when they start
[1:09:37] going to the high school parties when
[1:09:40] they start dating the wrong kind of
[1:09:43] person when they start drinking and when
[1:09:46] they start doing those things that's
[1:09:48] usually about when it starts and that's
[1:09:51] when Josiah that's when his walk with
[1:09:53] the Lord that was the time that he gave
[1:09:55] his heart to the Lord is that hard time
[1:09:58] in a teenager's life and Josiah
[1:10:02] dedicates himself to God and he starts
[1:10:06] and he's king. So, he starts taking down
[1:10:09] these idols and taking down these
[1:10:13] images. Manasseh had repented and turned
[1:10:16] things around, but his next generation
[1:10:20] Ammon fell right back into it. Now
[1:10:23] Josiah takes over and he sees that these
[1:10:27] things are wrong. And what's amazing is
[1:10:29] Josiah saw it without a
[1:10:31] Bible. He just knew that spirit there
[1:10:35] was something saying you're
[1:10:39] wrong. And they break down the altars of
[1:10:42] Balum in his presence in Josiah's
[1:10:44] presence. And in the and the images that
[1:10:47] were h on high above them and he cut
[1:10:50] down and the gro and the groves and the
[1:10:53] carved images and the molten images he
[1:10:55] break into pieces and he made dust of
[1:10:57] them and he stroed it upon the graves of
[1:11:00] them that had sacrificed under them. So
[1:11:02] Josiah does the same thing that Hezekiah
[1:11:05] had done generations before and the same
[1:11:08] thing that Manasseh had done after his
[1:11:10] repentance. And then he as he was
[1:11:12] getting older and he was getting more
[1:11:14] capable in his leadership, he sees the
[1:11:17] condition of the
[1:11:19] church and he says, you know, he says,
[1:11:23] we got to make some changes here. This
[1:11:25] is the house of God.
[1:11:28] And he says that we've let it go. We've
[1:11:30] let it we've let it get get dilapidated.
[1:11:33] We need to start fixing this church
[1:11:36] up. and he's he's set his mind and he
[1:11:39] talks with he talks with the brothers
[1:11:41] that were in the church and he says he
[1:11:42] says let's let's take the money that we
[1:11:45] have and let's invest it into the temple
[1:11:48] and start making these changes so we can
[1:11:51] have that the Lord can have a nice place
[1:11:54] that we can have a nice place to worship
[1:11:57] God skip to verse eight now in the 18th
[1:12:01] year so he starts renovating he starts
[1:12:04] fixing everything now watch how God
[1:12:06] honors honors it. Now in the 18th year
[1:12:09] of his reign, when he had purged the
[1:12:12] land and the house, he sent Schaffan the
[1:12:16] son of
[1:12:17] Aeliah and
[1:12:18] Maya the governor of the city and Joah
[1:12:22] the son of Jehoaz Joaz the recorder to
[1:12:27] repair the house of the Lord his
[1:12:31] God. And they had gotten as they were
[1:12:34] fixing
[1:12:37] things, fixing the structures and and
[1:12:40] cleaning things out, they one of the
[1:12:43] workers found something that hadn't been
[1:12:49] used in
[1:12:51] generations. They found the Bible. Amen.
[1:12:56] They bring it.
[1:12:59] They bring the scrolls to to
[1:13:01] Josiah. And I
[1:13:04] wonder as they're they're cleaning
[1:13:06] everything out and and they bring this
[1:13:08] Bible to Josiah, I
[1:13:11] wonder if you might have opened to
[1:13:14] Exodus or
[1:13:17] Deuteronomy and read, "Thou shalt make
[1:13:20] no graven images." Thou shalt make no
[1:13:23] images.
[1:13:27] Something like this. I am the Lord your
[1:13:29] God who rescued you from the land of
[1:13:31] Egypt, the place of your slavery. You
[1:13:34] must not have any other
[1:13:36] god but me. Ten
[1:13:39] Commandments. You must not make for
[1:13:41] yourself an idol or any of any kind or
[1:13:44] any image of anything in heavens or in
[1:13:47] earth or on earth or the sea. You must
[1:13:49] not bow down to them or worship them.
[1:13:53] For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous
[1:13:55] God who will not tolerate your affection
[1:13:57] for any other
[1:13:59] gods. I lay the sin of the parents upon
[1:14:02] the children, and the entire family is
[1:14:05] affected. Even the children in the third
[1:14:07] and fourth generations who reject me,
[1:14:10] but I lavish unfailing love for
[1:14:13] thousands of generations on those who
[1:14:15] love me and obey my commandments. Amen.
[1:14:18] Can you imagine if that was what he
[1:14:20] opened to and he read when they gave him
[1:14:23] that? And then he looked around and he
[1:14:26] said, "Where have we gone? Look at how
[1:14:28] far that we have failed. Look at how far
[1:14:30] we've gone in this." And he asked, he
[1:14:33] says, "Now go and inquire of the Lord."
[1:14:34] And there was a prophetist named Huda.
[1:14:36] And she prophesies that that because you
[1:14:39] have humbled yourself, because you have
[1:14:40] done this, God will not bring judgment
[1:14:43] upon you or upon your time, he will wait
[1:14:48] until afterwards. His wrath was stayed
[1:14:52] because Josiah believed the word of God.
[1:14:56] Something so simple as the Bible.
[1:14:59] And yet they worshiped all of those
[1:15:01] times.
[1:15:05] God in
[1:15:06] flesh commanded us, "Go
[1:15:10] therefore and make disciples of all
[1:15:14] nations, baptizing them in the name of
[1:15:16] the Father and of the Son and of the
[1:15:17] Holy Spirit, teaching them to obey and
[1:15:19] observe all that I have commanded you.
[1:15:21] And lo, I am with you always, even until
[1:15:24] the end of the age." He commanded us.
[1:15:27] Jesus Christ commanded us to do that.
[1:15:30] How often do we open the Bible and say,
[1:15:33] "Lord, I'm falling
[1:15:35] short. I'm not I'm not doing this." The
[1:15:38] same as Josiah, the same as Manasseh.
[1:15:40] Lord, we've done all of this. We have
[1:15:42] images of people up on our pulpits and
[1:15:45] we forget about and our focus is on that
[1:15:48] and we by doing that, whether it's the
[1:15:50] Book of Mormon, whether it's the Jehovah
[1:15:52] Witness Watchtower, whatever it is, we
[1:15:54] lift other things up over the book.
[1:15:58] And it's so easy to
[1:16:01] do. And then there's got to be a time
[1:16:03] when we sit back and say, "Wait a
[1:16:05] minute. Wait a minute. I've gone too
[1:16:08] far. Maybe I've put, as I call it, the
[1:16:11] little square
[1:16:12] idol, endless
[1:16:14] scrolling. Maybe I've put that in front
[1:16:17] of my walk with the Lord. Maybe I put
[1:16:20] watching TV, watching movies, and
[1:16:23] wasting all of this time. Maybe I've put
[1:16:25] all of that in in front of God. And then
[1:16:28] I go to bed at night and I and I might
[1:16:30] lay there and say, "You know what? I
[1:16:31] didn't read my Bible today. I didn't
[1:16:33] pray today. I'll do it
[1:16:36] tomorrow." And then same thing happens
[1:16:39] tomorrow. And you lay in bed and you
[1:16:41] say, "Ah, I didn't do it again." And
[1:16:44] then again, and then again. And pretty
[1:16:46] soon, years have gone by. Pretty soon,
[1:16:49] decades have gone by. And then you might
[1:16:51] sit back one day in your chair like
[1:16:53] Manasseh did and say, "Whoa, Lord, I
[1:16:57] have so failed. I have I've done so
[1:17:00] wrong here." If we are a child of
[1:17:06] God, let's skip to verse 30.
[1:17:14] And the
[1:17:17] king And the
[1:17:20] king went up to the house of the Lord
[1:17:23] and all the men of Judah and the
[1:17:24] inhabitants of Jerusalem and the priests
[1:17:26] and the Levites and all the people great
[1:17:28] and small. And he had read in their ears
[1:17:30] all the words of the book of the
[1:17:31] covenant that was found in the house of
[1:17:33] the
[1:17:34] Lord. Something, isn't it strange? They
[1:17:37] never read the Bible in church. It's
[1:17:40] easy to do. You might read a scripture
[1:17:42] here and a scripture
[1:17:44] there. Scriptures that just line up
[1:17:47] maybe with your doctrine and then throw
[1:17:49] the rest out. Replace it with something
[1:17:53] else. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
[1:17:55] the priests and the Levites and all that
[1:17:57] were great and small. And he read in
[1:17:58] their ears all the words of the book of
[1:18:00] the covenant that was found in the house
[1:18:02] of the Lord. And the king stood in his
[1:18:04] place and made a covenant before the
[1:18:06] Lord to walk after the Lord and to keep
[1:18:08] his commandments and his testimonies and
[1:18:11] his statutes with all his heart and with
[1:18:13] all his soul to perform the words of the
[1:18:16] covenant which are written in this
[1:18:18] book. And he caused all that were
[1:18:20] present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to
[1:18:23] stand to it. I like
[1:18:26] that. To stand to
[1:18:28] it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did
[1:18:31] according to the covenant of God, the
[1:18:34] God of their fathers. And Josiah took
[1:18:36] away all the abominations out of out of
[1:18:39] all the countries that pertain to the
[1:18:41] children of Israel, and made all that
[1:18:44] were present in Israel to serve even to
[1:18:47] serve the Lord their God. In all his
[1:18:51] days they departed not from following
[1:18:53] the Lord, the God of their fathers. The
[1:18:57] uh the worship team can come in closing.
[1:19:00] Let me read that again. This is friends.
[1:19:04] Let's all strive for this. Let's strive
[1:19:06] for this in our families. Let's strive
[1:19:08] for this in the church. Listen to this.
[1:19:10] And all his days they departed not from
[1:19:13] following the Lord. I want to be that
[1:19:15] stability. I know you want to be that
[1:19:17] stability. And all the
[1:19:20] days that we are
[1:19:24] here, they departed not from following
[1:19:26] the Lord, the God of God of their
[1:19:30] fathers. And it was
[1:19:32] because
[1:19:33] Josiah found the
[1:19:36] book and he started reading it and his
[1:19:39] heart was right. The others had left.
[1:19:43] They still worshiped and they were still
[1:19:46] just as sincere. Manasseh, how could
[1:19:50] you sacrifice your son? He was a man. He
[1:19:54] loved his son, but he did it because he
[1:19:57] thought that that was right. And we
[1:19:59] might sit back in our in our days
[1:20:03] and
[1:20:05] allow things in our lives. Friends, the
[1:20:08] Bible is very very clear on certain
[1:20:10] things. It should be the absolute in our
[1:20:12] lives. Not making
[1:20:15] a excuse
[1:20:18] to why it's not there. Living right
[1:20:21] morally, you know, not sleeping around
[1:20:24] outside of
[1:20:26] wedlock.
[1:20:28] Not sinning and lying and gossiping
[1:20:32] about each
[1:20:34] other. Live according to the word. And
[1:20:38] when you read it in the book, apply it
[1:20:40] to your lives. Don't try to make an
[1:20:42] excuse why you don't need to do
[1:20:44] it. Change your ideas and make your
[1:20:50] doctrines
[1:20:52] match the book. Amen.
[1:20:56] Amen. The great people of old did
[1:21:00] that. Brother
[1:21:03] Josiah. Good. Josiah said, "Give us a
[1:21:06] little bit more
[1:21:08] time." One of the
[1:21:12] things that this Bible tells us that if
[1:21:16] we want to make a change in our lives,
[1:21:18] if we want to take an an take our lives
[1:21:21] and make an adjustment, stop hitting the
[1:21:24] back of the rim with our jump shot, stop
[1:21:26] not catching fish, stop sinning, stop
[1:21:29] doing these things. If we want to make
[1:21:31] an adjustment in our lives, the Bible
[1:21:33] says very very plainly in Acts chapter
[1:21:36] 2. Peter they they came to Peter. He had
[1:21:39] just received the Holy Spirit. Things
[1:21:41] were were powerful. Then we sing that
[1:21:44] song victory is mine. That old
[1:21:46] Pentecostal
[1:21:47] song. And Peter and these disciples had
[1:21:50] received that victory at the day of
[1:21:53] Pentecost. And he said they they came to
[1:21:55] Peter. They said now we want this. We
[1:21:59] want you have we want what you have. Our
[1:22:02] hearts were cut in what you were saying
[1:22:04] when you were talking about this Jesus
[1:22:05] Christ. We want to change in our lives.
[1:22:08] And they said, "Peter, how do we do
[1:22:11] it?" And Peter said,
[1:22:14] "Repent. Every one of you repent. What
[1:22:18] does that mean?" Repent doesn't just
[1:22:20] mean feel bad. Repent means make an
[1:22:23] adjustment. Make a change. Go. You were
[1:22:27] going this way. Now repent. Now turn and
[1:22:29] start going the other way. Repent every
[1:22:33] one of you. Number one. Number two.
[1:22:37] And be baptized
[1:22:40] in the name of Jesus Christ. Acts. Put
[1:22:42] up Acts chapter 2 verse 38 if you
[1:22:45] would. Repent. Every one of you. He
[1:22:49] didn't just say well the ones that are
[1:22:51] really sincere. He didn't just say well
[1:22:54] the ones that this fits their doctrine.
[1:22:57] He said, "Every one of you repent and be
[1:23:01] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:23:05] the remission of your sins." And
[1:23:08] then
[1:23:10] then you can receive this gift of the
[1:23:13] Holy Spirit, the same gift that Peter
[1:23:15] had and that the disciples had. For this
[1:23:19] promise is unto
[1:23:21] you and to your
[1:23:23] children, and to them that are far off,
[1:23:26] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[1:23:30] call.
[1:23:31] Baptize. Be baptized. If you want to
[1:23:34] make a change in your life, this morning
[1:23:35] would be a good
[1:23:37] time to make that change. To say, "Lord,
[1:23:40] from this day on, I'm making an
[1:23:43] adjustment in my life. I'm making a
[1:23:45] change in my life."
[1:23:47] How many do we have to be baptized this
[1:23:48] morning? I know we have one. We have
[1:23:50] one. We have
[1:23:54] two. It's a good time to do it every day
[1:23:57] whenever you feel that pull. And
[1:24:01] brother, it's the word. It's the Bible.
[1:24:04] Is this brother Manny? Is this the one
[1:24:06] that you were talking about? Brother,
[1:24:07] what's your name? Jose. I've met you
[1:24:10] before. Brother Jose got a hold of the
[1:24:12] Bible. Am I
[1:24:14] right? Five years ago. He started
[1:24:16] reading the
[1:24:18] book. That was the change. As I said,
[1:24:21] the biggest change in my life. September
[1:24:24] 11, 2006, I made a commitment. I'm going
[1:24:27] to read this book and I'm going to read
[1:24:30] it every day of my life. I had read it
[1:24:32] my whole life, but now this is my time.
[1:24:35] I am going to do it. And it carried on.
[1:24:37] And it changed my life more than
[1:24:39] anything else I've ever done. Brother
[1:24:42] Jose, is the same for you?
[1:24:44] Amen,
[1:24:45] brother. It was the same for
[1:24:48] Josiah. Josiah got a hold of that book
[1:24:50] and he says, "Look at these pictures on
[1:24:52] the wall and look at all these relics
[1:24:54] and look at all this stuff. Wipe it all
[1:24:57] out. Change
[1:25:00] it. Look at my life. I'm drinking. I'm
[1:25:02] smoking. I'm doing all these things. I'm
[1:25:04] changing it all. I'm making an
[1:25:06] adjustment right now. And then let's
[1:25:10] catch some
[1:25:11] fish. Brother Josiah. Oh, I asked let me
[1:25:14] let me let me introduce this
[1:25:17] song. Brother
[1:25:19] Josiah told me last
[1:25:23] night. He said, "I have a song
[1:25:26] that Katie and I want to sing for you."
[1:25:31] And he said
[1:25:34] um he said we just basically he wanted
[1:25:37] you to just show it to me, right? Why
[1:25:38] don't you just sing it for
[1:25:40] me? And I said, "Well, well, what is
[1:25:43] it?" And he says, "Well, let us let us
[1:25:45] sing it for you right
[1:25:47] now." And it was exactly the
[1:25:51] theme of this sermon that I preached
[1:25:53] this morning. And I said, "Can you sing
[1:25:56] it tomorrow?" And he said, "No.
[1:26:07] But by the grace of
[1:26:09] God, brother
[1:26:11] Josiah, he wasn't ready, he said. But
[1:26:14] he's
[1:26:16] [Music]
[1:26:22] ready. How did we get away out here?
[1:26:30] So far from
[1:26:34] home, the path of least
[1:26:39] resistance always travels down.
[1:26:46] Used to be on the
[1:26:49] mountaintops where the eagle
[1:26:54] swar, but now it seems we can hardly
[1:26:59] keep our children
[1:27:03] [Music]
[1:27:06] anymore. Used to be so fresh and
[1:27:12] new. The first love was
[1:27:17] divine. I was the empty
[1:27:21] vessel. You were the filling
[1:27:25] [Music]
[1:27:27] wine. It's like a faded
[1:27:31] memory. Dream I can't recall.
[1:27:37] But every now and then I hear a distant
[1:27:42] urgent
[1:27:46] call. Where do we find him?
[1:27:51] Right where you left him.
[1:27:56] And how do we get back
[1:28:00] the way you came?
[1:28:05] How do we love him?
[1:28:08] The way he loves
[1:28:13] you with a
[1:28:16] brilliant burning
[1:28:22] flame. Remember now from whence you've
[1:28:26] fallen the works you did at first.
[1:28:32] There's a sal waiting for your eyes and
[1:28:35] a water for your
[1:28:39] thirst. Come out of her, my precious
[1:28:42] bride. Be spotless and be
[1:28:47] pure. The God of
[1:28:50] Elijah is
[1:28:51] [Music]
[1:28:56] here. I'm coming home. I've been a
[1:29:03] fool, a prodal, and
[1:29:08] blind. Took a while to
[1:29:11] realize I had left you far
[1:29:15] [Music]
[1:29:18] behind. Your holiness could not endure
[1:29:23] my selfish worldly ride.
[1:29:28] Your word could not be bent to fit my
[1:29:32] sinful, foolish
[1:29:37] pride. And now I found him
[1:29:41] right where I left him.
[1:29:46] And now I've come back
[1:29:50] the way I came.
[1:29:55] And now I love him
[1:29:59] the way he loves
[1:30:03] me. With a
[1:30:06] brilliant burning
[1:30:10] flame. Oh, I'm so glad I found him.
[1:30:16] Right where I left him.
[1:30:20] I'm so glad I've come
[1:30:23] back. the way I came.
[1:30:29] And now I love
[1:30:31] him. The way he loves
[1:30:37] me with a
[1:30:39] brillion
[1:30:41] burning a
[1:30:44] brillion
[1:30:45] burning a
[1:30:48] brillion
[1:30:49] burning flame.
[1:30:52] [Music]
[1:30:58] Keep keep the microphone. Brother
[1:31:01] Josiah, brother Josiah told me the
[1:31:03] story. His dad wrote that song. Could
[1:31:06] you I want you to say it. The story
[1:31:09] behind that song and what it's become
[1:31:11] now.
[1:31:13] My dad uh grew up in Pentecost going to
[1:31:17] camps where um people would tell him
[1:31:22] uh you got to speak in tongues to get
[1:31:24] the Holy Ghost. Say once you do that, it
[1:31:27] means you're good. You got it. And they
[1:31:29] would even say you just you can just
[1:31:31] make stuff up until it until it happens
[1:31:35] and then you have the Holy Ghost. So
[1:31:37] that that's how he grew up. My
[1:31:39] dad over time studied the Bible um and
[1:31:44] learned it for what it is. And
[1:31:47] uh when he came across Brother
[1:31:51] Brandham and found biblical
[1:31:54] truths that had been missing and saw
[1:31:58] them in the Bible, he wrote that song.
[1:32:00] And I did I didn't do a good
[1:32:02] representation of that song. My dad can
[1:32:05] play it much better. But the song's
[1:32:07] actually called
[1:32:08] Pentecost. And the first line is, "How
[1:32:11] do we get way out
[1:32:12] here? How do we get so far from from the
[1:32:16] the original
[1:32:17] thing?" And then uh as time went
[1:32:21] on, he said, "You know, really, we can
[1:32:24] sing this in our circles as well." Amen.
[1:32:27] Said, "Well, what's what what what's the
[1:32:30] purpose in all this?"
[1:32:32] And and when we get out here so far
[1:32:35] away, Brother Brandham said, "Where do
[1:32:38] you find him?" Right where you left him.
[1:32:42] How do you get
[1:32:44] back? The way you came. Amen. How do you
[1:32:47] love him? The way he loved you. Amen.
[1:32:51] With a brilliant burning flame. So
[1:32:53] that's the the short story of that song.
[1:32:55] Amen.
[1:33:04] So say
[1:33:10] I it's easy to get
[1:33:13] off and it's easy to
[1:33:18] stray. And it is my
[1:33:21] ministry to bring us to this book.
[1:33:25] Make this
[1:33:27] book the only absolute in our lives.
[1:33:32] This book should be our lives. God
[1:33:35] preserved this book for us through all
[1:33:39] the
[1:33:40] ages. He preserved
[1:33:42] it for us to read today and to apply to
[1:33:47] our lives.
[1:33:49] And I ask everyone, let's get back to it
[1:33:52] like Josiah did like Manasseh did at the
[1:33:55] end. Let's get back to this book.
[1:33:58] Brother, if you'd go and and uh and
[1:34:00] sister, if you'd go and and meet the the
[1:34:02] deacons in the back. Sure.
[1:34:14] We bow our
[1:34:17] hearts. We bend our
[1:34:22] knees. Oh spirit, come make us
[1:34:26] [Music]
[1:34:31] humble. We turn our
[1:34:35] eyes from evil things.
[1:34:40] Oh Lord, we cast down our
[1:34:45] idols. Give us clean
[1:34:49] hands. Give us pure
[1:34:53] hearts. Let us not lift our souls to
[1:35:01] another. Give us clean hands.

[1:39:29] Amen. Feel good, my friend. Why don't
[1:39:32] you stand right
[1:39:35] here? Brother, could you give me the
[1:39:38] testimony that you just
[1:39:42] gave? Five years ago, I gave up
[1:39:47] drinking, doing drugs.
[1:39:51] I met
[1:39:53] Manny five years
[1:39:55] ago and he told me he was bringing in a
[1:39:58] sword.
[1:40:01] I really thought he was bringing the
[1:40:03] sword, but he gave me a Bible.
[1:40:07] And today I want to make an adjustment.
[1:40:10] Amen.
[1:40:13] And
[1:40:15] yes, you
[1:40:22] My name is Jose Navaro.
[1:40:38] encouraged persuaded by anyone else.
[1:40:42] This is a step that is command that the
[1:40:45] apostles both Peter and Paul said for us
[1:40:50] to repent to be baptized in the name of
[1:40:53] the Lord and that is what you're doing
[1:40:56] here today in front of all of these
[1:40:58] people you have a tremendous testimony
[1:41:01] and in front of all of these people
[1:41:03] you're being baptized not into this
[1:41:05] church by any means you are being
[1:41:09] baptized into the body of Jes Jesus
[1:41:12] Jesus Christ for the washing away of
[1:41:14] your s.
[1:41:18] [Applause]
[1:41:24] God bless you.
[1:41:26] Amen. My
[1:41:28] brother, by your own confession, I
[1:41:31] baptize you in the name of the Lord
[1:41:34] Jesus
[1:41:35] Christ for the remission of mercy.
[1:41:43] Praise God.
[1:42:00] Praise God.
[1:42:02] The
[1:42:02] baptism, this has been going on for
[1:42:04] 2,000 years.
[1:42:07] And the spirit is the same in this room
[1:42:09] today as it was at the day of Pentecost
[1:42:11] when Peter baptized those who wanted to
[1:42:14] be baptized. It's the Holy Spirit and it
[1:42:16] doesn't change.
[1:42:18] Sister
[1:42:23] Rebecca, sister, God bless you. If you
[1:42:27] come and stand right here. You feel
[1:42:30] good? Oh, yes. Yeah. I have to I have to
[1:42:32] admit, I didn't expect this. Oh, it's
[1:42:35] it's been coming a long time. Um, I'm
[1:42:37] getting I noticed that my shield of life
[1:42:39] is, you know, with God's been getting
[1:42:41] weaker and so and I'm letting craziness
[1:42:44] of work get involved. The craziness of
[1:42:46] the world and I was like, I know better.
[1:42:49] I know better. I need to change
[1:42:51] tomorrow. I need to change tomorrow.
[1:42:52] I'll start tomorrow like diets. And it
[1:42:55] wasn't happening because I would keep
[1:42:57] pushing it off. And then a couple days
[1:43:00] ago in my head there was a song that
[1:43:03] says I want to live the way he wants me
[1:43:06] to and I haven't. And so I was like you
[1:43:09] know I got to and then you put that on
[1:43:11] Facebook not Facebook on the WhatsApp
[1:43:13] and I was like you know what let's make
[1:43:15] it today. Let's do it today. Let's make
[1:43:18] that change today. And so I was like yes
[1:43:21] this is going to be the day I got to
[1:43:22] change uh my habits in life. And so it's
[1:43:25] like you know don't start tomorrow.
[1:43:27] tomorrow we leave, you know, start
[1:43:28] tomorrow and it keeps happening. It's
[1:43:30] like, you know, let's make this
[1:43:32] dedication now before, you know, it's
[1:43:34] too late, you know. So, she's making an
[1:43:37] adjustment in life. That's right. And
[1:43:39] friends,
[1:43:44] and as you see, Sister Rebecca, you
[1:43:46] know, this is by your own choice. Yes.
[1:43:48] You come here. Yes. And this is a very
[1:43:50] holy moment. Yes. And the spirit of the
[1:43:53] Lord is here. And I believe he is
[1:43:55] pleased. And may God as I baptize you
[1:43:59] and I bring you down into this water.
[1:44:02] The book of Romans says that you are
[1:44:05] baptized into this grave of water. And
[1:44:10] when you come out, you come out a
[1:44:12] cleansed vessel. That's a symbol of what
[1:44:16] you have made this decision to do is to
[1:44:19] be baptized and to come out and make
[1:44:22] this change in your life.
[1:44:29] Sister Rebecca, by your own confession,
[1:44:32] I baptize you in the name of the Lord
[1:44:35] Jesus Christ.
[1:44:39] [Applause]
[1:44:40] [Music]
[1:44:48] [Applause]
[1:44:50] Praise God. Praise God. He He is good.
[1:44:54] He keeps He continues it. He continues
[1:44:56] blessing us. And you know, just the
[1:45:01] inspiration for this with this man
[1:45:03] Josiah and how he made changes and he he
[1:45:06] made an adjustment in his life. I pray
[1:45:09] that there will be people, you don't
[1:45:11] have to come to be baptized to make that
[1:45:13] adjustment. I pray that there are people
[1:45:15] in this room that will make an
[1:45:18] adjustment in your life today and make
[1:45:21] changes and say,
[1:45:23] "Lord, I'm going to do what these
[1:45:25] brothers did. I'm going to do what
[1:45:26] Manasseh did. I'm going to do what
[1:45:30] Josiah did. I'm going to do what these
[1:45:32] people that went into the waters of
[1:45:34] baptism did. I'm going to do those
[1:45:36] things. Lord, help me. Give me the
[1:45:39] strength, Lord, and I'm going to do what
[1:45:41] you told me to do for tonight, our
[1:45:44] service
[1:45:45] tonight, just in honor of
[1:45:48] Josiah, I want to uh as I mentioned on
[1:45:52] Wednesday, bring in your scriptures and
[1:45:55] we'll pass the microphone around tonight
[1:45:57] and read a scripture and tell us why
[1:46:02] that scripture means so much to you.
[1:46:05] I would not doubt it one bit if Josiah
[1:46:08] opened that Bible and his eyes went to
[1:46:10] that second commandment. Thou shalt not
[1:46:13] have any other graven images before you.
[1:46:16] Let's let's bow our
[1:46:18] heads. Let's all stand
[1:46:23] first. Our
[1:46:25] father, how great and wonderful you are,
[1:46:29] Lord.
[1:46:31] Lord, you are the same
[1:46:33] God that was with David, the same God
[1:46:37] that was with Solomon, the same God that
[1:46:40] was with Hezekiah, the same God that had
[1:46:43] mercy on Manasseh, the same God that was
[1:46:46] with Josiah. And Lord, you're the same
[1:46:49] God that's here with us now. For you
[1:46:51] change not as is written in your your
[1:46:54] word. Father, we thank you for this
[1:46:56] service. We thank you for these souls
[1:46:57] that came up here to be baptized, to
[1:47:00] make this public confession of what the
[1:47:02] Lord has done in their hearts. And Lord,
[1:47:06] I pray for both of
[1:47:07] them that the almighty God in the form
[1:47:11] of the Holy Spirit would go before
[1:47:14] them and Lord, pave their way. May your
[1:47:17] word light their path,
[1:47:19] Lord. Strengthen them, Lord Jesus, I
[1:47:22] pray. And may your will be done, Father,
[1:47:26] in Jesus
[1:47:27] name. Amen. Amen. God bless you,
[1:47:31] brothers and sisters. Brother Josiah, I
[1:47:33] believe, has another song and then you
[1:47:35] can be dismissed. God bless you. Let's
[1:47:37] give the Lord a hand clap of praise
[1:47:38] today.
[1:47:40] Amen. Praise
[1:47:44] God. Singing gloryy to his name.
